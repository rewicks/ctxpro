Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.<eos> I don't care what people believe.<eos> And neither do you.<eos> As an authority on myself, I must disagree.<eos> Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.<eos> And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt.<eos> It is a chance we simply cannot take.<eos> The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll remove it for you.
Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.<eos> Golden chains.<eos> You could buy a ship with these.<eos> - Do I need a ship?<eos> - What?<eos> Am I going somewhere?<eos> Of course you're not going anywhere.<eos> So, am I invited to your wedding?<eos> I didn't ask for this marriage.<eos> I didn't want it. No?
Absolutely not.<eos> I've got orders from Lord Bolton.<eos> And what are those orders?<eos> To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.<eos> You think you'll get a reward.<eos> I serve Lord Bolton.<eos> Any appreciation your father...<eos> You think you're getting a reward.<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand, and I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.
There were footprints.<eos> There were muddy footprints.<eos> In here? Yes.<eos> Where?<eos> They were right here.<eos> This is happening.<eos> Honey, there's only a lock on the inside of the door.<eos> No.<eos> No, that's impossible.<eos> Baby, the door opened as soon as I grabbed it.
But I can't manage...<eos> A girl went missing and you put your effort into that, instead of being a housewife.<eos> I think your parents would be proud.<eos> Where's the bench?<eos> It's been here since the 70s.<eos> I sit on it when I feed the birds.<eos> - So this is a life or death matter?<eos> - It is.<eos> There are hundreds of them.<eos> Maybe someone moved it.
- That's a lot of work, Uncle Hubert<eos> - Yes, it is ...<eos> Please do not call me by my first name at work.<eos> You're the apprentice I am the master.<eos> Okay, Uncle Master How much time will we need today?<eos> I'm expecting about six ... twelve hours.<eos> If we then set the clock back running<eos> Won't it be set twelve hours behind?<eos> - The clock has twelve digits.<eos> If during repair I detain it for twelve hours and afterwards it again runs properly.
- Exactly.<eos> Good.<eos> Please<eos> - Ah.<eos> you have been too lenient with him with these tales and have never set limits.<eos> What is this?<eos> Karl.<eos> This is a very serious matter.<eos> Do you know where this watch is?<eos> Did Hannes take it?
Are you here?<eos> No, there is no one here.<eos> I wanted to see if you're alright<eos> - Thank you, that's very nice.<eos> - Can I help you with something?<eos> Is there someone down there or not?<eos> I do not know.<eos> But there is something you can help me with.<eos> Did you take Torstenson's watch?<eos> Yes, but I put it back.
- Was yesterday just a festival?<eos> I wanted to protect you.<eos> The Swedes are dangerous..<eos> - Yes, perhaps at that time<eos> - How could Torstensohn come back?<eos> - No man ilives to be nearly 400 years old<eos> I'm so sorry for everything How awkward.<eos> - And when did I lie?<eos> - About the Torstenson watch.<eos> - That you put it back.
- Torstenson's clock, yes.<eos> - You stole it<eos> - No, just re-took it.<eos> - The Clock maker had it.<eos> - Mr. Zifferle.? Why?<eos> To repair it. Oh...<eos> - Thanks<eos> - You're welcome. But now I must sleep.<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> If I return the clock, Everyone will think I stole it.
Check the crime scene photos.<eos> -Sextant, yes.<eos> Musket, yes.<eos> -"Old sea chart"?<eos> -No.<eos> Not that I can see.<eos> -Let me see.<eos> Annika went through the lists of Dick's...<eos> An old sea chart is missing from the murder scene.<eos> Dick had just been given it by those sisters, but it's not on any lists.
-Why did you run?<eos> -What do you want?<eos> Your aunt thinks your uncle had a relationship with Michelle.<eos> -According to rumors, so did you.<eos> -Yeah? Is that illegal?<eos> -Did your uncle have an old sea chart?<eos> -You think I killed him?<eos> -Answer the question.<eos> -A 17th century sea chart of Dyngön.<eos> -Was Dick supposed to have it?
-I won't let you ruin your future.<eos> What future?<eos> I don't have a future if I don't fix this.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> Jump aboard, will you?<eos> I'll fix it.<eos> Just do as I tell you.<eos> Yes. For 400,000 the bottle is yours.<eos> No, I will not go any lower.<eos> Then I'll put it up for auction, which will raise the price significantly.
I have all the time in the world.<eos> Well, I haven't.<eos> Frau Hoffmeister is a stickler for punctuality, soup is in the plates at 7.30.<eos> I abhore soup.<eos> Hey, Fritz.<eos> You call that a kiss?<eos> - No time, Anna.<eos> I'm too busy.<eos> - You're always too busy!<eos> Your washing's dry but have yet to iron it!

I have had to learn to ride, shoot, make a campfire.<eos> I dull my mind with work to try and numb my yearning for you.<eos> But the evenings by the campfire, tired as I am I write to you envying the sheet of paper which will soon be in your hands. Pressed to your breast perhaps even to your lips.<eos> My beloved, I can think of nothing but you from morning till night. Especially at night.<eos> If only you knew how much I miss you, no sooner was our love disclosed than we had to say goodbye.<eos> The moment I saw the train take you away I knew that your absence would be unendurable.<eos> But do not worry. This is our pact and I will stand the test with fortitude.<eos> We are parted by distance, but also by time.<eos> Little by little the past feels more and more like a foreign country.<eos> Your letters are all that I have to keep it alive inside me.
They know that you're stupid.<eos> They just don't know how stupid.<eos> You say that like it's my hole card.<eos> Maybe it is.<eos> Suppose you could sit down and have a chat with these guys, what would you say?<eos> I'd tell them the truth.<eos> You're just a fucking wonder, do you know that?<eos> Go ahead what?<eos> With the truth.<eos> I'd like to hear it.
Can you two please stop messing around?<eos> Marriage is a matter of respectability...<eos> You mean responsibility.<eos> Read the script properly.<eos> Marriage is like a flower.<eos> At first, it blossoms delicately.<eos> - Did you get this off Bible-Online?<eos> - Can you shut up?<eos> Quite right!<eos> A small blossom, that can grow into something large and beautiful, when you give it a lot of passion and devotion.
It was just the shock when I landed because...<eos> I did fly for 7 seconds.<eos> I was flying and then I... landed on my side. But my hip isn't broken.<eos> It's just bruised and beat up and... stupid<eos> And old like me.<eos> Stupid hip.<eos> What's on your face? Oh.<eos> It was supposed to be war paint.<eos> Sorry about your watch.<eos> I shouldn't have crushed it. It was really cool.
I was meditating.<eos> Meditate with your eyes open then.<eos> Maybe I took a few punches too many.<eos> How many fights did you have George?<eos> Seventy in all.<eos> You had 33 amateur fights and you lost your first and your last.<eos> Hold on, here's your mail.<eos> You were kidding about reporting me?<eos> Don't fall asleep again George, the show's on tonight. It's going to be a good one.<eos> I watch it every week, it's great show.
Is that your final answer?<eos> Somebody is coming.<eos> Well done Jack.<eos> You've got guts.<eos> Revenge?<eos> Why revenge?<eos> I still, I don't know what they've done to you<eos> What they've done?<eos> Yes, they, them, not me.<eos> You're looking for some kind of justice and you're seeking it for revenge but there is a difference... - between the two of them and you can't see it.
And from the patient's profile you have decided it was me?<eos> I know it's you.<eos> Do you have any idea how many people in the entertainment industry... fit that profile?<eos> Thirty-nine.<eos> I checked.<eos> You're wrong!<eos> Do you want more evidence?<eos> What about this?<eos> You want to kill me because Of a scar?<eos> That scar covers my son's kidney... and I want it back.
I kept her answering service because just for a second... just a second, I can trick myself into believing she's still alive.<eos> Sometimes I just need to hear her voice.<eos> So here we go.<eos> The million-dollar question.<eos> Emily, you're are now playing for one million dollars.<eos> Remember - you have three minutes to answer.<eos> Three minutes that can change your life<eos> But I don't believe a word of it.<eos> I gave you a chance to confess.<eos> Why didn't you take it?
- Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> He had a gun.<eos> He was on top of her.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> It's fine.<eos> It was him or you.<eos> You're good.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> It's just-- he didn't drop it.
"Dad's such a laugh!<eos> "The funniest thing about him "is his driving school with only one car.<eos> "Two cars would be too much work.<eos> "Because Dad is a lazy slob!"<eos> "When a sick pet is brought to Mum's clinic, "Mum shags the customer because Mum's a slut!"<eos> Take that back!<eos> What, you didn't do that?<eos> - We were separated! - Not divorced!<eos> I'll lose you your deposit!<eos> Put that down. Put it down...

- How much longer to the ruins?<eos> Oh, they were closed. - Yeah.<eos> We're gonna catch them on the way back when we're going to the airport.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Exactly. - We'll leave early, right? Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What happened to my apple? Your apple...<eos> Right?<eos> - Give me the list.<eos> - I don't have it.
And if you think I'm just some dog who's gonna keep coming back, you're wrong.<eos> But if you want true love, then this is it.<eos> This is real life. It's not perfect, but it's real.<eos> And if you can't see it, then you're blind, all right, and I give up.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> So, what about this time machine?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> How does it work?<eos> Well, it's complicated.<eos> Am I gonna have to get naked to operate it?
And the son was sent to the galleys, and was taken in shackles to Brest.<eos> Son? What son?<eos> Oh, he was a most handsome and most courteous young man, who his father cherished dearly, and whom he also cherished.<eos> Rumour was he got away on the galleys at Brest.<eos> But nobody gets away on the galleys at Brest.<eos> Since then, the bakery has been abandoned.<eos> Nothing stirs within.<eos> Where is this bakery?<eos> Bit further on, behind the ruins of the old wall.<eos> You can't miss it.
- We'll be right down, Mum.<eos> - Help me with this, will you?<eos> I hope you've thought about coming to join us at the Ministry, Olanna.<eos> We need first-class brains like yours.<eos> How many people get offered jobs personally from the Finance Minister?<eos> I've decided to go to Nsukka.<eos> I'll be leaving next week.<eos> Is that right?<eos> You have decided to move to Nsukka?<eos> I applied for a job as a lecturer in the Department of Sociology and I got it.
I think this is a very brave decision.<eos> Will you come back for her christening?<eos> Yes. Of course, I will.<eos> - This is excellent, Harrison.<eos> - Thank you, madam.<eos> He doesn't deserve you, you know.<eos> This tart tastes better than the one I had the last time I was in London.<eos> Thank you, madam.<eos> My master is telling me that everybody in Mr Odenigbo's house says the same.<eos> You made it for them?

- You'll see.<eos> Just follow the GPS. - ETA, 7 hours and 3 minutes.<eos> Erica?<eos> - Kristina speaking.<eos> - Hi, Mom...<eos> Make a right turn.<eos> Per, wake up...<eos> We'll be at the border soon.<eos> Put away the gun.<eos> Put it in the glove compartment.
Are you OK?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm at the Palace with Carlos.<eos> The palace?<eos> Yes, we are celebrating.<eos> As Tom Jobim says,<eos> "Brazil is not for beginners..."<eos> How can one live in a place where stamps come unglued, soap melts almost before you can use it, rivers run too fast to the sea?
Wait, what?<eos> She uses a pen name, which you would know if you were a real fan.<eos> She's actually in Bora-Bora right now, researching her next book.<eos> I've always imagined some grizzled, bearded man banging on a typewriter in a hut somewhere.<eos> But that's brilliant.<eos> Explains the sensitive side.<eos> Have you read the latest one, Alex Rover Never Surrenders?<eos> I'm almost at the end.<eos> It's torturing me that I don't have time to finish it right now.<eos> I think it's genius when Alex gets the queen bee, and drops it in the enemy camp and the swarm comes.
- Okay.<eos> - Just hold my coat for one minute.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Let's see now.<eos> Well, I ain't no surgeon, but,<eos> I guess that the bullet would be<eos> right about here.<eos> There, I got it.

Yes, generations of naive tourist, crypt raiders, and drunken university Students got lost down there, permanently.<eos> We don't have time to get lost.<eos> The time is running out.<eos> For the... research that we are doing.<eos> Pete, we have Baudin's map.<eos> - You do? - We do? Well, the place that we... work for... does.<eos> Nicolas Baudin, he was a French explorer.<eos> Most people don't know that he charted the French catacombs... before he left on his famous Australian expedition.<eos> No, most people don't.<eos> We could have Mrs. Frederic scan it and send it to us.
Cheers to that.<eos> Cool!<eos> Cheers, big ears.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> This?<eos> Who's hair is this?<eos> Well, it belongs to my soul mate.<eos> It's the same color as yours.<eos> Well, lots of people have that color hair. It's the same as yours too.<eos> Give it back to enzo.
Excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> We were discussing Talan's appearance and symptoms, and there's a very rare disease called porphyria.<eos> Um, symptoms include, um, excessive facial and body hair and receding gums which obviously makes the teeth look longer.<eos> And yeah, it also causes crippling chronic joint pain, muscle weakness, - all sorts of nerve damage, even seizures.<eos> - So, people with this can barely move?<eos> Exactly and it's so rare that some doctors haven't even heard of it.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> - What's up?<eos> Uh, my necklace, it's gone.<eos> - Oh, I haven't seen it.

For this game, you have to be strong.<eos> [Melancholic piano sound]<eos> [Male voice, excited moans]<eos> [Moans} Yes.<eos> [Manic screams]<eos> [Melancholic piano sound]<eos> Alev.<eos> Can I tell you?<eos> The class trip is an opportunity to integrate into the class.<eos> - Enjoy it.
- Yeah.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> What does she say? Enough about Karen.<eos> Isn't it weird, though, because she works for you?<eos> I'm paying Karen to remodel my home.<eos> If she thinks she can expect more than a paycheck for her services, fuck her.<eos> - Wow. - All's fair, Hank.<eos> I see you and your husband have the same twisted sense of entitlement.<eos> That's--it's actually kind of cute.<eos> I don't want to twist your arm, but, um, I'd like to take your hand here and shove it up my skirt.
Your life isn't ruined.<eos> You guys are 21. You have your whole life in front of you.<eos> Do you know what it's like to be 21 now?<eos> A quarter of the kids coming out of college can't get jobs.<eos> That's correct. Mother says you can work hard and go to the right school but nothing is guaranteed anymore. That's life.<eos> These guys are right.<eos> The whole American Dream thing you guys grew up on, that's all it is now... a dream.<eos> You're too young to be this cynical!<eos> You really see the world this way?<eos> That's not how we see it.
That's kind of what I called you for."<eos> Look, I'm terrific on phones.<eos> I can sell prosciutto to a rabbi, and I have.<eos> But you're not selling anything.<eos> You can't bullshit your way through this one.<eos> The only way to nail this challenge is to study.<eos> Then study up is what I'm going to do.<eos> Let me ask you, is there a blanket statement I could say that could apply to literally anything?<eos> And then I either shove product down their face or give them another hotline.<eos> You're tech support, so if you refer them to another number your phone will ring again, 'cause it's your number you referred to.
(PEN) I'm sorry, darling.<eos> (GROANS)<eos> - Ssh, ssh, ssh!<eos> - I've got you.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Well done, Jerry.<eos> Right. - Have you got the gun?<eos> - No, sorry, Richard. I put my foot down.<eos> I just decided it was too dangerous. - Quite right.<eos> - I simply don't trust myself around it.
It's nothing personal.<eos> You let him go?<eos> No matter.<eos> Look.<eos> The next job?<eos> Copied directly from Wheen's files also. Take weeks to match that.<eos> But our safes are tested.<eos> Repeatedly. Exhaustively. I sought out the most nefarious screwsmen in the city all were defeated by our new locks.<eos> Mr. Chatwood whoever we contend with here, they are no ordinary craftsmen.<eos> I have never known thieves to take such a haul only to return it.
"Should the strikers' action persist in paralysing our docks,<eos> "the great machine by which five million people are fed and clothed "will come to a dead stop - and what is to be the end of it all?" What indeed!<eos> The strikers are hardly revolutionists, sir.<eos> Working men deserve fair pay.<eos> Last week a dozen dockers who tried to work had their bones cracked - a constable from J-Division went home with a bloodied nose.<eos> All I... The great machine is breaking down.<eos> With the greatest of respect, sir, the strikers number in their thousands.<eos> A handful of troublemakers does not make them all anarchists.<eos> Firebrands and ruffians, Reid, who must be brought to heel if social order is to prevail!<eos> And the East End is the root of it! What do you suggest, sir? Well, I believe you still have a Pinkerton on your ticket?
You know, we have an incredible sex life. But that's not the point, you know.<eos> I love Michael Jackson's Off the Wall album.<eos> I wouldn't necessarily want to only listen to that for the rest of my life.<eos> Oh, honey, I've been there.<eos> I mean, you'll listen to it a lot in the beginning.<eos> You'll listen to it in all different sorts of places.<eos> You'll listen to it in the car, in the disabled toilet cubicle in the McDonald's in Egham, in your unconscious granny's hospital room. - Granny Mary?<eos> - It's what she would have wanted.<eos> But then, you know, you're just gonna get to the point where you're not that bothered about listening to music at all.<eos> You just play it on birthdays, or when you're very, very drunk.
That's it.<eos> You got that?<eos> Good shot, Chloe.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> - It'll never happen again.<eos> - Oh, it will. Be positive. No.<eos> Once in a lifetime.<eos> It's so sweet, what you said about that necklace.<eos> Yeah. - I should wear it more often.
What?<eos> Water here, smells nasty.<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's a horrible smell.<eos> This place has very high humidity and it was raining when we were location hunting.<eos> Finally, I'm at the front of back room.<eos> Im going in, now.<eos> A traditional hairpin?<eos> The door has been taped.<eos> Is it okay to open it?
For a good reason.<eos> What Ragnar Lothbrok has sworn is true.<eos> Your half-brother was caught raping a Saxon woman.<eos> Then he attempted to rape Ragnar's lawful wife, Lagertha, the shield-maiden.<eos> So unfortunately, you cannot punish him.<eos> Now, who has the key?<eos> - Come, Bjorn.<eos> - Like father, like son.<eos> - It seems I owe you an eternal debt.<eos> And I look forward to collecting it.
Not just a few.<eos> There's a sizable coalition that wants to see your bill fail, including environmentalists from your own party.<eos> - Don't think the bill does enough.<eos> - We wanted a passable bill.<eos> That's why we aimed for middle ground... do you actually care about the Delaware river?<eos> I don't sponsor legislation I don't care about.<eos> Until recently, you hadn't sponsored any legislation at all.<eos> I spent my time in congress focusing on things that were important to my constituents.<eos> - The shipyard.<eos> - Kept it open as long as I could. Okay.

Okay.<eos> That's one thing.<eos> What are the others?<eos> I'd love to provide you a list of all the things I've done in congress, but we've got 15 minutes... your opponent has linked your inactivity to your fondness for single-malts.<eos> I've been very open about my past, and I've done everything I can to overcome it in a responsible, permanent way.
- You seem upset.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Nothing. Can I get more than two words out of you?<eos> I'm just trying to relax.<eos> Claire,<eos> I love you.<eos> Did Zoe expect me to twiddle my thumbs until her arrival?<eos> Perhaps she's making the mistake thinking her time is as valuable as mine.<eos> Proximity to power deludes some into believing they wield it.
Don't we have an event at 11:00?<eos> There won't be any events until we talk.<eos> You're hijacking the microphone.<eos> You're contradicting everything I say.<eos> We need to be promoting the watershed act.<eos> Well, I appreciate your being so forthright.<eos> Let me tell you what I don't appreciate.<eos> The D.N.C. Is running a man with zero track record, except for substance abuse, to fill my shoes.<eos> I realize you don't want to be here, sir, but it seems like you're deliberately trying to sabotage my campaign.<eos> Despite my better judgment, I'm trying to save it.
Well that's... I can't help it.<eos> Well,... what do you say?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Can you give me a little time to consider this?<eos> All you want.<eos> How about an hour?<eos> I have to close some real estate down the road.<eos> Old man Biller.<eos> I finally bought the farm.<eos> Or should I say, he sold it?
Black Beauty.<eos> I'll knock the door now.<eos> Hiya.<eos> Dixie, Michelle.<eos> Here to see the flat.<eos> 1,170 pounds a month, all up front.<eos> She said 1,000 on the phone.<eos> Shh. It's all right, love.<eos> Let's just get it.<eos> - Can we have a look at it first?
Oh, hey, hey, hey, come on.<eos> For Christ's sake, it's the one thing that's certain in life. Death.<eos> No, I know.<eos> But it's just... It's hard, Dad.<eos> Look. I want you to have something, all right?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Your watch.<eos> I don't want your watch.<eos> Yes.<eos> My father gave it to me when I started working.

Fucking!<eos> I'll have to do the vocals 'cause knob-head Jake's gone off with his posh bird.<eos> Fucking off, wanker.<eos> No one knew who he was anyway.<eos> Hold on, big lad, we need a wee deposit before you go.<eos> Would you look at this?<eos> Lovely little piece there.<eos> No.<eos> Not my watch, boys.<eos> Take it off, you little prick!
Touch the back of a Cyberman's head, the electromagnetic pulse deactivates it.<eos> What's this for?<eos> Just a mad guess here - it blows up the planet?<eos> Implodes it.<eos> There's also a trigger unit.<eos> I'll have that, then.<eos> Is there any other way to activate the bomb?<eos> It's set to respond to MY voice.<eos> I have the verbal code.<eos> You will not activate it without a direct order from me.
It's organic.<eos> Lignified.<eos> Could be sawdust or wood shavings.<eos> In his lungs!<eos> Heavily calloused.<eos> What's he been building?<eos> The patch from his trousers.<eos> Ah, ammonia.<eos> The refrigeration wadding on his ship?<eos> Is he stripping it?
Hey, hey.<eos> Hey, doll.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Chloe.<eos> Hey, um, Chloe, can you bring me a bottle of champagne?<eos> - Sure.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - No, doll.<eos> Can you bring it to my trailer?
- Listen.<eos> You got a great situation here.<eos> I'm not looking to fuck it up, but you better believe I want a piece.<eos> Been on the road for two years.<eos> And nothing... I mean nothing has panned out.<eos> You give me some fuckin' hush money, send me on my way.<eos> We both know I'm gonna end up back inside.<eos> And you know what?<eos> I'm not going back.<eos> This is my only play, and I'm making it.
About what Louis said.<eos> I agree.<eos> Are you following any of this?<eos> No.<eos> We're talking about a vice intrinsic to water. Gravity.<eos> Start reading from "This vice... "<eos> Page 62<eos> Throwing away the skin?<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> You don't eat it?

This can be published.<eos> I'll give a call to Mr. Sawano.<eos> Mr. Sawano?<eos> It's Takagi's speaking.<eos> I was sorting Ms. Kazu's papers when I discovered a really interesting thing.<eos> A copy of an unpublished comic.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> This will be a real treasure for her fans.<eos> Yes, understood.<eos> I take it to the office.
It's new.<eos> Look.<eos> What do you think this is?<eos> A cat's foot.<eos> That's cruel.<eos> This is used as a trigger for... demon bomb.<eos> Someone must've thrown it here.<eos> If that's a trigger, where is the bomb?<eos> Somewhere in the house...<eos> Do you want to look for it?
Please, ma'am. Stay outside! Stay outside!<eos> All right, give me some diazepam there.<eos> Set up a drip 10 milligrams of valium.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I need pulse, respiration.<eos> Quickly, quickly.<eos> Clear the airway. Suction it up.<eos> Swipe it clean.<eos> Hold him.<eos> Let me get it in. IV in.
The bus leaves from the jetty at 7:00.<eos> Screw the bus.<eos> I got a car.<eos> Great!<eos> That'll be much more comfy.<eos> Micaela.<eos> Yes.<eos> His camera.<eos> Yes.<eos> He gave it to me when he was sick.
Fuck me!<eos> Well?<eos> Would one of you fuck Miss Halliday, please?<eos> - That was a little funny.<eos> - Finally.<eos> Did you take calls from the DOD asking you not to run the story?<eos> That happens all the time.<eos> The entire population of the Pensacola Minimum Security Prison is people who did things that happen all the time.<eos> - We ran the story.<eos> - Then you retracted it?

A bottling plant?<eos> I want to make you a proposition.<eos> See, I wanna talk about... well, I guess the only way to describe it is to call it what it is... a government bailout.<eos> You want to be our partner?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> With all due respect, Governor, our consumers are vampires.<eos> And considering your political leanings, the PR nightmare of partnering with the vampires' enemy number one just isn't worth the risk.<eos> You haven't heard my proposal yet.<eos> See... during my time in office here in this great state, I have seized my fair share of property, one of which is this old oil refinery.<eos> The company that used to operate it left it for a newer facility.

Obviously you weren't in control of christian. I am.<eos> I'm telling you this because I think he's gonna hurt you<eos> In the same way.<eos> No, you're telling me this because you're jealous And a little drunk.<eos> God, it's such a girl-thing to do.<eos> Look, christian's not gonna hurt me.<eos> If anything, I'm the one that's gonna hurt him.<eos> She's on her way back.<eos> We got 20 minutes.<eos> We are now hacking into ryan's facebook page Because you have to be friends with him to look at it. Bla bla bla.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Come on, babe.<eos> Your little story?<eos> - What story? - The ucla hospital.<eos> Bunch of guys running a train on you.<eos> There's no way that kid's smart enough To come up with that on his own.<eos> But I know somebody who is.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> It worked, babe.<eos> You wanted my attention, and you got it.
You say that every time!<eos> Cut it out!<eos> I'm sorry, we made a mistake.<eos> We took a kidney instead of mending your nose.<eos> You sick!<eos> Calm down, ok!<eos> You can live with one kidney.<eos> I only have one testicle and I manage fine.<eos> Yes! My kidney...<eos> Give it back.
Do what you must.<eos> I recommend we remove all magic.<eos> Even memories of magic, to be safe.<eos> But don't worry. I'll leave the fun.<eos> She will be okay.<eos> But she won't remember I have powers?<eos> It's for the best.<eos> Listen to me, Elsa. Your power will only grow.<eos> There is beauty in it. But also great danger.<eos> You must learn to control it.

It's tiresome. It's predictable, the same thing all the time.<eos> It's a lot stuffier than I remember.<eos> Yeah, Gustav, you got enough goddamn flowers?<eos> Maybe he's covering the fact that he stinks.<eos> Nice one, Meems.<eos> Where is he, anyway?<eos> Why are we talking about him like we're in West Egg?<eos> Oh, there he is. Mr. Big Pants.<eos> Watch the door.<eos> I just had it detailed. Watch the door.
Oh, thanks.<eos> But I'm using you for a bigger purpose.<eos> This pseudo-feminist fantasy tween chick-lit bullshit is a devolution of the female mission.<eos> It's cancerous to the intelligence of young women.<eos> You got this job because whether the general public chooses to acknowledge it or not, voice over matters.<eos> Everyone in the world watches movie trailers.<eos> Everyone in the world sees commercials on television.<eos> Or they hear them on the radio.<eos> And that is power!<eos> Look, this quadrilogy is going to make billions of dollars and your voice is going to be the one to inspire every girl who hears it.
The paper's operating at a loss.<eos> We need people like Zoe...<eos> I'm very aware of how much we're hurting, Margaret.<eos> Staff reductions, dip in circulation, each one of those faces and every subscriber we lose, they keep me awake at night.<eos> Now I... I won't argue the business side of things.<eos> It's neither my place nor my area of expertise.<eos> But know this,<eos> Zoe Barnes, Twitter, blogs, enriched media, they're all surface.<eos> They're fads.<eos> They aren't the foundation this paper was built on, and they aren't what will keep it alive.
This is Clarisse, Dad.<eos> Your fiancé?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Look at this bombshell!<eos> Melita says they're on their way.<eos> It's so warm. ...for 2 years. 200 francs a month!<eos> But tonight we live it up! Champagne, music!<eos> That campaign is really absurd.<eos> Everyone loves it.

Okay.<eos> I had Huell lift your dope.<eos> I told you I couldn't risk the guy not taking you.<eos> No!<eos> Before!<eos> The cigarette!<eos> You stole the cigarette.<eos> - What?<eos> - The ricin cigarette!<eos> You had him steal it off of me!
What, this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But just yesterday, your charity, the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz Foundation, announced a $28 million grant for drug abuse treatment centers throughout the Southwest.<eos> Charlie, the Southwest is our home, and we couldn't just ignore what's going on in our own backyard.<eos> But I'm sure you're aware that there are people who suggest other motives.<eos> Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times wrote a column suggesting that the grant was a kind of publicity maneuver to sure up the stock price of Gray Matter Technologies because of your association with Walter White.<eos> Well, that's not exactly the way--<eos> To cleanse yourselves, so to speak, of having a methamphetamine kingpin as cofounder of your company.<eos> Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up.<eos> I have to believe that the investing public understands we're talking about a person who-- who was there early on, but who had virtually nothing to do with the creation of the company, and still less to do with growing it into what it is today.
- No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, because it has history.<eos> Come on.<eos> Prohibition.<eos> The sweet smell of success.<eos> And per se has Thomas Keller.<eos> Game, set, and match.<eos> The whole vibe is so Yountville.<eos> You transplant it to Manhattan,
They are located in this area.<eos> It did not look like a cat, more like a...<eos> Reptile.<eos> a small lizard scared you, boss?<eos> That's not all.<eos> The water... did not normal, and tasted weird...<eos> It smelled different, and burned the skin.<eos> I have a theory, but you will not like it.<eos> I do not like it before...<eos> But I want to hear it.
- I said, shut up!<eos> I lost a man due one of your harmless dinosaurs.<eos> Well, to be fair:<eos> This is their country and we are intruders.<eos> Really?<eos> If you say another word, I put a bullet in your head.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss .<eos> Really.<eos> But these craters... this lost world... - is perhaps the last place where these animals live.<eos> - I just want to protect it.
6 Actual, head here. Helicopter on its way.<eos> Haldeman here.<eos> Understood.<eos> Over.<eos> Do you think you are here?<eos> Come on ladies, for me.<eos> Come.<eos> Come on.<eos> Take the gun, boss.<eos> I'd used it.
'You don't need his approval,' you just want it.
There's been a fatal shooting.<eos> A police officer.<eos> We should get you issued with a firearm.<eos> Book yourself in at the range.<eos> I don't have time.<eos> This is Belfast.<eos> I really don't want these pictures to end up in the press.<eos> 'The site can memorialise the account.<eos> 'That restricts profile access to confirmed friends and family 'but means people can still write on Sarah's wall in remembrance.'<eos> I'd rather her father sent in a formal request as next of kin and closed it down completely.
Aaaaah! Mummy!<eos> Mummy!<eos> You didn't tell me this was still happening.<eos> It's OK.<eos> She shouldn't have that necklace on in bed, should she?<eos> Why?<eos> She could strangle herself.<eos> Here, take a wee drink, sweetheart.<eos> There you go.<eos> Where did she get it?

Get everybody out.<eos> Jerry.<eos> Seal these rooms off.<eos> Call forensics.<eos> Matthew, can you hear me?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Matthew, what happened in there?<eos> What happened?<eos> He was handing me his gun.<eos> Then he put it to his face and fired.
But these people can.<eos> He's out of prison on licence.<eos> If I call the police, he'll go straight back to jail.<eos> I can't do that to him.<eos> Liz, under the Domestic Violence, Crime And Victims Act, charges can be brought against your husband without your permission.<eos> I can make the call.<eos> But it's important for you that you do it yourself.<eos> They can arrange a shelter until he's arrested.<eos> I'm offering you a lifeline.<eos> Take it.
Tell dad that food is ready.<eos> How are you?<eos> I did not know that it was such.<eos> I'll never do it again.<eos> He ​​can not force me.<eos> It was not God.<eos> - I would look for the little guy.<eos> - He's better.<eos> I have lasagne with.<eos> Eat it before it is bad.
An hour ago. With her son. To visit relatives in Pisa.<eos> She will return when the work is done. If the work is done.<eos> - You're the builder?<eos> - No, I'm the benefactor.<eos> - Pietro Bembo of Venice.<eos> - Bembo?<eos> The poet?<eos> Yes.<eos> No. I try.<eos> I talk about poetry better than I write it.
And she's my mom, so she's not supposed to.<eos> - I get that.<eos> That's cool.<eos> - Whatever, dude.<eos> I don't think you have to...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Given everything he's dealing with, I think it's pretty incredible that Derek is going on this trip.<eos> He is a normal guy who got dealt a shitty hand, and in spite of that, he's not letting it stop him from doing the things that he loves.<eos> I'm going on this trip because I wanna be there for Derek, and I'm documenting it because I want to share his story with everyone back home.
Well, I guess school's still in session.<eos> I guess you schooled me there, Marty.<eos> Let's move on.<eos> Please.<eos> Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.<eos> I had no intention of bringing you into this.<eos> It wasn't part of a plan.<eos> I would've told you if it was.<eos> I know.<eos> The idea just struck me, and I went with it.
No.<eos> Not that I would mind.<eos> I am married, after all.<eos> I don't have time for other lovers.<eos> Shit.<eos> It's turned.<eos> Give me that.<eos> You could've just stepped on it.<eos> I have asked the super to get an exterminator in here, and he won't do it.<eos> So any time I see a cockroach, or a spider, or whatever, I try and trap it, and then I leave it by his door.
You don't want everything going into the Roth IRA.<eos> Five, ten grand a year, and I'll set you up with a nice diversified package, low risk, high yield.<eos> I think Claire and I have things pretty well under control.<eos> If I brought a senior U.S. Congressman into the fund, that would really up my stock in the company.<eos> What're you all gabbing about back there?<eos> We were talkin' about the old library.<eos> Yeah, what's happening to it?<eos> They gonna tear it down?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They could gut it, they could turn it into a student center.
It's gonna happen in six stages.<eos> Stage one...<eos> Left face, forward march.<eos> Francis Underwood's career, Harvard Law degree, one of the youngest state legislators in the history of South Carolina, a 22-year veteran of the U. S. Congress,<eos> House Majority Whip, speaks volumes about the values young people learn here at the Sentinel, values like honor, duty, discipline, like sacrifice, service and respect.<eos> Ladies and Gentlemen, the Francis J. Underwood library.<eos> Congressman?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wrote a speech.<eos> But I'm not gonna read it.
Edward has the car ready.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Take your time.<eos> You hear from Peter?<eos> Looks like the shipbuilders are on board.<eos> Tomorrow morning we start working on his draft for his announcement speech.<eos> Got it.<eos> And I want the brief on the mark-up for the Watershed Bill...<eos> I got that with me.<eos> Ride with me to the airport, we can go through it in the car.
You, I am done with.<eos> She did not do anything to you.<eos> Oh, I bet you are.<eos> All right, Rachel.<eos> Do you have somewhere to go?<eos> Yeah, I have like a million places to go.<eos> OK.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Yep.<eos> If we're late for Shabbat, uh, you could just put your guitar in your cubby, and then we'll take it home at the end of the day, OK?

Not funny at all!<eos> Gonna need you to clean the blood splatter on the walls, evidence marks on the floor, and patch up the bullet holes.<eos> That should get you started.<eos> - Supplies are inside.<eos> You okay, buddy?<eos> Been trying all morning to get tickets to the Wilco concert at Soldier Field tonight.<eos> - Can't get through.<eos> - Wilco? Aren't they for, like, dads with receding hairlines and shit?<eos> Come on, Wilco is the beacon of anti-commercialism.<eos> Yeah, because no one wants to buy their whiny music, they gotta give it away for free.
Come on, Debs, dinnertime.<eos> - Can Kyle come?<eos> - No.<eos> All right.<eos> You know, my mother, she reminds me very much of your Fiona.<eos> Beautiful. Raised six kids. Never complained.<eos> A saint. My father, he was a...<eos> - A rolling stone.<eos> - She put my hand there.<eos> I didn't even move it.
You know, I'm tired of pretending... that the ends justify the means.<eos> What matters are the decisions we make now.<eos> She's alive.<eos> It would be wrong to destroy her.<eos> You're going to perform the operation.<eos> There's no one else remotely qualified.<eos> No.<eos> I've had my team delete all of your backups.<eos> This is the last remaining copy of your Mary's brain.<eos> I'll keep it safe... until I know the changes you made to the machine are a success.
- Henry, don't... mess... this... up.<eos> Well... one of the first houses he'll see.<eos> - It does not give a good first impression, boy.<eos> Bloody painful.<eos> - Turn it! Turn it! Hold it!<eos> - That's it, that's it!<eos> - Right. So, here's the cricket uniform.<eos> There's the cricket field...<eos> The rules...<eos> I could print it for ya.
Um, well... I would start by kissing your neck.<eos> - Oh, would you?<eos> - Yeah, I would.<eos> And then I would proceed to caress your arms and your back and those very, very, very long legs.<eos> - It's getting very hot in here.<eos> - Well, maybe you should undress.<eos> - I already am. - Nice.<eos> - I need a cigarette.<eos> - You quit.<eos> - All right, I'm not gonna smoke it, I'll just... suck on it.
- This cannot wait.<eos> That man tried to sodomize me.<eos> I did no such thing.<eos> You said I reminded you of Donatello's David... and offered me a private tour of the papal bedchamber.<eos> Is this an attempt at humor?<eos> He touched my cock.<eos> Holiness, we saw your blessed wrath against sodomy hours ago.<eos> Now, you must condemn Francesc Gacet for the same offense.<eos> Bring the Pope's Pear.<eos> Shove it up Gacet's ass.
Titles mean a lot to me, but when I got around to reading the fucking book, oh, my God, it's so depressing.<eos> It's like it's Dickensian but not in a good way.<eos> The working classes want to leave a Broadway theater feeling the way they feel when they leave one of my concerts.<eos> - With tinnitus?<eos> - Happy, uplifted, inspired, preferably a little bit horny.<eos> Yeah, well, that's very funny 'cause I'm not feeling very horny right now.<eos> Just homicidal maybe.<eos> Hank, we're gonna need you to burn this draft, just forget all about it.<eos> Chalk it up to a creative miscarriage.<eos> But when you get up tomorrow, you take a fresh page, you put it in your typer, and you start a new one, one that hues closer to the tone of the movie.
Have I fucked countless others?<eos> Does that make me a bad man?<eos> I...<eos> I don't think so.<eos> But in the court of public opinion... I am a scoundrel, a rogue, a rake.<eos> Perhaps even a rapscallion.<eos> But the fact is... I can't live without you, Natalie.<eos> Olly, no, put the fucking gun down.<eos> - Olly.<eos> Put it down.
Well, now you know.<eos> Weren't we expecting that cargo plane?<eos> There's, like, a million acres of land out there.<eos> He could be anywhere.<eos> There's a caribou crossing over here.<eos> Or he might be somewhere around this rock bluff, good place for spotting them in the trees.<eos> Do you have a gun in the cabin?<eos> Why?<eos> Do you have a gun?<eos> Nelson must have it.
- Welcome home. Ryusei, what's the matter?<eos> Keita.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Daddy couldn't go along without seeing you any longer.<eos> I've broken the rules to see you.<eos> Father is not my father any more.<eos> You are right.<eos> But, listen, during six years... I was your father during six years.<eos> I was not a good father, but I was your father.<eos> The flower you gave me... I'm sorry, but I lost it.
Mom, it's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> But it's one of those moments as a parent you wish you could do over again.<eos> We thought we had a night off from the kids.<eos> A night off from the kids, huh?<eos> - So you were out pretty late.<eos> - No.<eos> We left early.<eos> I snuck a bottle of wine home in my purse.<eos> I thought we'd save it, but your father opened it as soon as we got home.
Old man's phone doll. Your next upload is due.<eos> I'm nowhere near ready.<eos> All right.<eos> All right. Uh, we gotta get back to you.<eos> All right. Bye.<eos> Chill, q, don't let them tentacles get you down.<eos> My guess is they're looking for the least little entity.<eos> The entity who could.<eos> Find her and she drags the rest behind... oh, there it is, q!<eos> Don't let it get away.
Absolutely true.<eos> But here's the zinger.<eos> None of these tribes have any knowledge of each other's existence.<eos> Coincidence?<eos> Hm?<eos> Coincidence?<eos> Where do you think all these separate peoples got such an idea?<eos> Dysentery.<eos> Aha. Q, you're getting to be very funny lately.<eos> Listen up, if you have a soul, which I'm betting you do, this baby will locate it and connect you with it.
And then guess what we're gonna do after that.<eos> - Go to the park?<eos> - Better.<eos> Toys"R"Us?<eos> Way better than that.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know, maybe... ChuckE. Cheese? - Really?<eos> - I promise.<eos> Daddy's gonna give you hecka tokens and we gonna play all the games, OK?<eos> And then we're gonna get your favorite pizza, and we'll eat it all up.
- I always feel so guilty around Ginger.<eos> We've got to make sure we make their stay extra nice.<eos> My God, 5 days.<eos> Look.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> Oh, but where would I wear a Fendi bag?<eos> Oh, go ahead.<eos> It's my treat. - No.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, my God. I love it. Look.
Shit.<eos> Good job, boys! Great job, Mulcahy!<eos> This is an unprecedented situation.<eos> We have a full scale war going on.. on the White House grounds.<eos> Mulcahy!<eos> Take out the limo!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Take the limo!<eos> What are you waiting on?<eos> Take it out!
No, it's not Marcus!<eos> You have his phone and his baby.<eos> What's the matter with you? !<eos> Why hasn't he called you back?<eos> I might have given him a fake number. Oh God.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait. I have a card he gave me for one of his dry cleaners.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. All right.<eos> I used it for gum.
Ever since I was little.<eos> You, for example.<eos> You can't resist your primitive reflexes, it's your nature!<eos> Of course I can resist my instincts!<eos> I'm not an animal!<eos> Not even for an evening!<eos> I bet you can't resist even for an evening!<eos> - Ouch!<eos> - OK. It's a bet.<eos> OK, so if you lose your bet, since you love that apron, I suggest you wear it for a week,
Bad idea!<eos> According to my clinical research on drug induced amnesia...<eos> Said the fake scientist...<eos> - Hmm, and what are your parents' names?<eos> - What?<eos> Their names are... um, uh...<eos> Damn it, Krieger, did you drug me?<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Wow, memory is such a fragile thing.<eos> And if Archer's real identity is exposed to him too suddenly, his mind may reject it permanently.
- What's going on?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> I had 5,000 euros in this bag.<eos> I tell you, it was in here!<eos> What did you say?<eos> What did he say?<eos> - What?<eos> You had my bag?<eos> - For two seconds.<eos> I found it, I was looking for you.
That's a drag.<eos> Yeah, it's the worst thing that's happened all month.<eos> I had all of Robbie's pictures on it.<eos> And I know you told me to put them on my computer, but I just didn't do it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I went to the store. They gave me a new number.<eos> You could have kept your old number.<eos> Do you want the number?<eos> Yeah, give me a sec.<eos> I'll put it in my phone.
When something cuts too deep, he reaches for a comforting cliché.<eos> Anna.<eos> Please.<eos> Begging?<eos> Do you know why she chooses married men, Michael?<eos> 'Cause she doesn't have to care.<eos> They can't hurt her.<eos> And she can leave whenever she wants.<eos> Look at that face.<eos> He needs love so badly until he has it.
Henry was looking for his skateboard.<eos> It's not in the garage, is it?<eos> No.<eos> - Let's go, Henry. - Huh?<eos> - Bye. - Bye.<eos> Bye, guys.<eos> What, no coffee for you?<eos> Uh, no, thanks.<eos> We have to get rid of him tonight.<eos> I just coded the message, I'll drop it on the way to work.
The papal throne awaits him.<eos> I met him at Giada Ricci's carnival party.<eos> Rumour has it that he used to be Europe's best exorcist.<eos> - Are you pulling my leg?<eos> - No.<eos> I never joke about the devil.<eos> Do you know I'm very, very bored.<eos> We're having a great, great time.<eos> You cut up the duck.<eos> Cook it on a high flame for 15 minutes.
There would be no risk of any misunderstanding,<eos> Sister Maria can review the text...<eos> - No, I'm sorry.<eos> - Don't insist.<eos> I don't wish to raise any false hopes, there's absolutely no question of any interview.<eos> Sorry, but why do you always answer?<eos> Why not let Sister Maria talk?<eos> Madam...<eos> I took a vow of poverty.<eos> And you can't talk about poverty... you have to live it.
Princess Antonietta gave birth to her only daughter,<eos> Elisabetta Colonna of Reggio.<eos> The princess died after giving birth.<eos> Young Elisabetta, in these opulent rooms, had a happy and carefree childhood.<eos> But shortly after, the financial hardship endured by Prince Erminio, forced him to sell the property.<eos> They're migrating west... but now they are resting.<eos> Did you know that I know the Christian names... of all of these birds?<eos> Why... did you never write another book?<eos> I was looking for the great beauty, but...<eos> I didn't find it.
Hey, Sam.<eos> You have a good day.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Hi.<eos> I wish I had more time.<eos> Got an asset inventory that can't push.<eos> Do you need money?<eos> No.<eos> Did you get my letter?<eos> I sent it after I crossed the bridge.
Do you need money?<eos> No.<eos> Did you get my letter?<eos> I sent it after I crossed the bridge.<eos> - It was a postcard. - No.<eos> When?<eos> A couple days ago.<eos> Well, postcards take more time.<eos> Dwight, I'm not following.<eos> I sent it on my way to Deerfield.
-Only we have time to train.<eos> -Excuse me.<eos> I am responsible for pleasure intake here at the hotel.<eos> For me it is important that children get great experiences home with them.<eos> We have new entertainment facility.<eos> It would be valuable to us if you wanted to try.<eos> Forgive me, but are you responsible for the broken blind in room 212?<eos> No.<eos> It is in any case so that a woman have complained about a broken blinds.<eos> I wonder if you want to go with and identify it?
Is it Newark, or you stick around here with me?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think any question that starts with "Either are you back to Jersey or 'X'", the correct answer is "X".<eos> I was in.<eos> And I took to it like a gambler's son.<eos> He gave me the full run of the plac.<eos> I started right in tuning up the affiliate business.<eos> I learned about payment processing, off-shore banking.<eos> He even let me bring in my own people.<eos> They needed some Princeton math, so I gave it to them.
- Yes, we're in the same class.<eos> - Dad can help you.<eos> - But Klara and I are supposed to.<eos> - I promised I'd come.<eos> - Maybe Klara can come here?<eos> - She can have some meringue pie!<eos> - She's waiting for me now.<eos> She's also watching her little brother, her parents are away.<eos> But you're here now.<eos> How often do you see each other? We're making meringue pie and eating it together.
- If she promised...<eos> - It's not often that dad is here.<eos> - Don't do it for me.<eos> - We can see each other tomorrow.<eos> No.<eos> Are we supposed to make meringue pie on our own?<eos> - Stop with the meringue pie.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Let's do this...<eos> - Let's eat it now.
And your mom did the right thing.<eos> No, she was totally stupid.<eos> - You hair looks so great.<eos> - Klara...<eos> - You hair looks so great.<eos> - Give me the beanie.<eos> — Give me the beanie, Klara.<eos> - Nope.<eos> - It's really ugly.<eos> - Give it back!
I hate sport That damn sport<eos> It gives me such anxiety. That damn sport.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do you want to try?<eos> - Come on!<eos> No.<eos> I have never played electric guitar.<eos> You've got to start sometime.<eos> Kenneth can show you good chords.<eos> We'll teach you how told hold it.
She likes trains.<eos> Maybe she just got on a train and...<eos> She looks like the other girls.<eos> Yes, she fits the profile.<eos> Could Elise still be alive?<eos> We simply have no way of knowing.<eos> - How's the cat?<eos> - What?<eos> How's your cat?<eos> Elise was supposed to feed it.
- We should be looking at plumbers, steamfitters, tool workers...<eos> Other injuries were probably but not conclusively post-mortem.<eos> So... not gored.<eos> - She has lots of piercings that look like they were caused by deer antlers.<eos> I didn't say the deer was responsible for putting them there.<eos> She was mounted on them.<eos> Like hooks.<eos> She may have been bled.<eos> - Her liver was removed.<eos> Why would he cut it out if he's just gonna sew it back in again?
I'll fucking blow her head off!<eos> - Drop that fucking gun now.<eos> - Drop your weapon!<eos> Get down the fucking stairs right now!<eos> - Drop your weapon.<eos> - Drop your fucking guns!<eos> - Get back! - Stand down.<eos> Drop your gun!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Put it on the ground now!
-Did you come here just to say that?<eos> -Yes.<eos> That's really kind of you.<eos> Oh, I'm not taking this.<eos> GOLD PANNING IN SWEDEN<eos> Lovebird is the commonly used name for the genus agapornis, which comes from the Greek agape, which means love, and ornis, which means bird.<eos> In the wild, these birds spend their whole life's with one partner and it is said that if one of them passes away, the other will pass shortly after...of grief.<eos> Hello!<eos> He told me I was kind.<eos> Did you know that if you put a bumblebee in the freezer, it falls asleep and you can tie a string round it.

That's very kind of you.<eos> You're calling about his escape?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> I'd like to collaborate On an article for the "Journal of Abnormal Psychology".<eos> You want a writing partner?<eos> Could we meet?<eos> Hello?<eos> Dr. Carruthers?<eos> Ms. Lounds, come on in.<eos> Now, you wrote in your tattler archive that the Chesapeake Ripper once removed a man's tongue and used it as a bookmark for his Bible.
Dr. Carruthers?<eos> Ms. Lounds, come on in.<eos> Now, you wrote in your tattler archive that the Chesapeake Ripper once removed a man's tongue and used it as a bookmark for his Bible.<eos> They call this a Colombian neck tie.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Dr. Paul Carruthers wrote an article for the Journal of Criminal Psychology in which he described Dr. Gideon as being a pathological narcissist who suffers from psychotic episodes.<eos> Let's hope he got some satisfaction from being proved right.<eos> I think this is about more than just getting the Chesapeake - Ripper's attention.<eos> - Gideon's mind was dissected by psychiatrists and, as a surgeon, he is applying his own skill set.<eos> He gave you something better to do with your tongue than wag it.
He's had a mild seizure.<eos> That doesn't seem to bother you.<eos> I said it was mild.<eos> Are you the man who claimed to be the Chesapeake Ripper?<eos> Why do you say "claimed"?<eos> Because you're not.<eos> You know you're not, and you don't know much more about who you are beyond that.<eos> Are you the Ripper?<eos> A terrible thing... to have your identity taken from you.<eos> Well, I'm taking it back, one piece at a time.
Of course not.<eos> I love that you've written so much on social exclusion.<eos> Since that's why I'm here, I was wondering...<eos> Are you Freddie Lounds?<eos> This is unethical, even for a tabloid journalist.<eos> I am, uh... I am so embarrassed.<eos> I'm afraid I must ask for your bag.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your bag.<eos> Please hand it over.
I'm talking to his shadow suspended on dust.<eos> No wonder you have nightmares.<eos> The attacks on you and your mother were different.<eos> They were desperate.<eos> Your dad knew he was out of time.<eos> - Somebody told him we were coming.<eos> - The man on the phone?<eos> It was a blocked call.<eos> Did you recognise his voice?<eos> I'd never heard it before.
When did you find out?<eos> - 12 weeks ago. - 12 weeks ago?<eos> Lung cancer.<eos> You don't smoke.<eos> Is it treatable?<eos> It's stage four.<eos> And we know there's no stage five, don't we?<eos> When were you gonna tell me?<eos> Far enough into the future that I'm really not prepared to have this conversation right now.<eos> Neither am I, but we're having it.
Hello.<eos> Hi. It's so good to see you.<eos> - This is my friend Tobias.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> How do you two know each other?<eos> There should remain some mystery to my life outside the opera.<eos> I'm one of his patients.<eos> - Did you enjoy the performance?<eos> - I did.<eos> I loved it.
The families of your father's victims filed wrongful death suits. Wrongful death?<eos> That means that they get everything, Abigail.<eos> Every penny.<eos> What you have here is all you have.<eos> Let them take all his money. I don't want any of it.<eos> You can make your own money.<eos> How much would I get... if you wrote a book about me? About my dad?<eos> Plenty.<eos> Do you still wanna tell my story?<eos> I think you need to tell your own story, but I am the one to help you tell it.
Courage of a warrior Anything shall burn<eos> The scorched earth Devouring our best<eos> The scorched earth Always killing everything<eos> My pain It drains my soul<eos> Plagued defeat Black sands of Iden<eos> As far as the my can see Lacerated all land<eos> As far as the my can see There shall be no end...<eos> Every detail is reminiscent of him, about how it could have been.<eos> But life must go on.<eos> You can't wallow in grief forever, it will eat it up.
Prediction. Prophecy. Divination.<eos> They hang above us.<eos> The stars. The planets.<eos> No, I don't... Sorry.<eos> Have you never looked up?<eos> - Sounds badly paid.<eos> - Well, well. My master says that knowledge is its own payment.<eos> Yeah, well, the only knowledge I have is that God controls my fate as he sees fit, and I try to draw consolation from that,<eos> though I would like to know which of my many faults he's punishing me for now.<eos> My master says, "Whilst we live in fear of hell, we... We have it."
Well, I'll be jiggered.<eos> You won't eat?<eos> I do not suffer the same hunger as our friends.<eos> I believe they would sell any religion for a jug of beer.<eos> You have an angel about you.<eos> You've been touched for the king's evil.<eos> What was it like to look upon His Majesty?<eos> Curiosity fuels you, then, not food.<eos> Let the King worry on his own magic.<eos> God knows he needs it.
Scorpion!<eos> Today's dead and gone. You've got 19 days left.<eos> I don't know, Pedro.<eos> Pedro. Pedro.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> Off you go.<eos> Julián!<eos> Want me to carry the bag?<eos> No, thanks, Alyssa, it's heavy.<eos> I'll carry it, it's nothing.
- Do you know me that well?<eos> - It was just one slip.<eos> Forget it. Elspeth, I need this job.<eos> Then show us something.<eos> With your students' work, with the magazine, with your new poem.<eos> Be who you were.<eos> Nobody can do that.<eos> Dina?<eos> Hey, why are you painting in your pretty blouse?<eos> I'm retiring this blouse. I'm giving it to you.

I'm giving it to you.<eos> No, we'll just have it re-sewn with a Velcro strip like the others.<eos> Do you want it or not?
There's a problem, though.<eos> If writers are called artists, too, then as a fellow artist, I'm not in the same league as Miss Delsanto, because Delsanto in her art takes us from here to somewhere else.<eos> She takes what we look at every day, and she elevates it out of the ordinary.<eos> As when John Updike looked at birds sitting randomly on a wire and called them "punctuation for an invisible sentence."<eos> Or Jeanette Winterson describes<eos> "tripping over slabs of sunshine the size of towns."<eos> And Joyce Cary speaks of a cold morning with<eos> "frost on the grass like condensed moonlight."<eos> And James Agee speaks of men removing their stiff collars in the evening and their "newly bared necks seeming tall and shy."<eos> Each artist makes the world his or her own, and in doing so elevates it.
I don't know.<eos> Come on Doctor Mann, you know me better than that.<eos> A boa constrictor.<eos> Not bad but too physical.<eos> Too much effort spent and not enough strategy.<eos> - A scorpion. - Too obvious.<eos> Stings its mate, a no-brainer for the arachnoid vice squad.<eos> A net thrower.<eos> What's that?<eos> A spider that throws a net on its prey, stings it, and sucks it dry.
I might become a bit theoretical.<eos> You may.<eos> I'd like you to tell me about your picture.<eos> Although the Christian church was split up in 1054 because of differences in opinion between the Eastern Church and the Western Church, what we today call the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church, this is a typical Eastern Church icon.<eos> It usually depicts the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus and more rarely, for instance, the crucifixion, which in the Western Church was much more prevalent.<eos> If you generalize, you could say that the Western Church is the church of suffering, and the Eastern Church is the church of happiness.<eos> Why is she looking right at me?<eos> Well, she's telling a story.<eos> Icons were originally a kind of pictorial Bibles for the illiterate.<eos> There are some who say you... you read an icon, even write it.
Try to imagine that in one fell swoop, you lost all desire to read and all your love and passion for books and letters.<eos> I don't even know if I can imagine that.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> But as so often before in my life, a bit of hope sprang from a mystical event.<eos> Which was?<eos> Three dead leaves performing a strange ballet.<eos> That gave you hope?<eos> For what? For regaining my sexuality.<eos> - How?<eos> To claim it by force.
The spark plug caps have been removed. Yes, I did that.<eos> Was that wrong?<eos> For the first time I had the pleasure of having an eight-cylinder car.<eos> The possible combinations of eight spark plug caps on eight spark plugs are 40,320, if I remember my math correctly.<eos> And only one of these will make the car run, which gave me all the time I needed.<eos> Beethoven, huh? He was certainly very good, but, you know, he couldn't write a fugue.<eos> You think so?<eos> - Well, yeah, I think so.<eos> It would be more precise to say that Beethoven renewed the fugue.<eos> That he was such a visionary that the old Bach purists, they accused him of not mastering it.
I imagine the quarrel had already started on the stairs and that one or the other party had laid claim to one or the other of my holes in conflict with his Negro brother's interests.<eos> You shouldn't use that word.<eos> It's not what you call politically correct.<eos> Negro.<eos> Well, excuse me, but in my circles, it's always been a mark of honor to call a spade a spade.<eos> Each time a word becomes prohibited, you remove a stone from the democratic foundation.<eos> Society demonstrates its impotence in the face of a concrete problem by removing words from the language.<eos> The book burners have nothing on modern society.<eos> I think society would claim that politically correctness is a very precise expression of democratic concern for minorities.<eos> And I say that society is as cowardly as the people in it who, in my opinion, are also too stupid for democracy.
I suppose they're afraid that I... I can't keep away from their men.<eos> Right.<eos> And can you?<eos> No.<eos> I've spoken with a psychologist.<eos> He says you're addicted, but that it's not the kind of addiction that can't be treated.<eos> They have some groups.<eos> I know about these kinds of groups.<eos> I don't have anything to say to a psychologist.<eos> I'm not suggesting therapy. I'm demanding it.
Here we go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're waving now.<eos> Bring it back up. Here comes the big one!<eos> Yeah! There it is.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Now, now, that shit ain't funny, right there. That shit ain't funny at all.<eos> I'll come get it now.<eos> - You want it?
He said you got put up at the big jail one time.<eos> Coleman told you that? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I have. I...<eos> I did 29 months in the penitentiary for assault on a police officer.<eos> They pulled me over behind a shopping center uptown.<eos> This one officer, pretty-boy type guy, had some issue with me.<eos> Thought I had something to do with one of the girls he knew. And I didn't know what the hell he was talking about.<eos> Then they tried to shoot me, after I beat the shit out of all three of them.<eos> Or one did.<eos> Deputy went for his gun and I grabbed it.
What?<eos> I want a felt life, because I want to be an author.<eos> So, like, all the horrible things that happen to me, they're OK, because they just... bring me closer to enlightenment.<eos> Sometimes when I talk to you... I forget who the grown-up is.<eos> I'm gonna go to bed now.<eos> All right.<eos> Peter, are you ready?<eos> OK, tell me someone brought the bottle.<eos> Who's got the bottle?<eos> I have it here.
There's no point in attempting to converse with a cartoon.<eos> Ooh, "converse", Your Lordship!<eos> Thy flowery language doth give me a right throbbing bone-on!<eos> Finished.<eos> Drink?<eos> I've got e-mails.<eos> You know that's Gwendolyn Harris?<eos> The Labour candidate.<eos> Did you read my background doc? Yes.<eos> Why don't you read it tonight?
I'm gonna do whatever Maggie says.<eos> The moment I know my sister is safe, I don't care after that.<eos> I think you need a better plan.<eos> Take my gun.<eos> No. She said to come unarmed.<eos> Are you a good shot?<eos> I'm an overachiever, sir.<eos> All right.<eos> There's a kitchen door, side alley.<eos> I'm gonna leave it unlocked.
What the hell is this?<eos> -No Offense to have luck.<eos> -Pour Does not bother me.<eos> I know you.<eos> You think I do not. -I think so.<eos> -Easy To commit mistakes, my friend.<eos> -My Gentlemen, we play or not?<eos> No, here he covers up too much.<eos> He is here again.<eos> Showing your face here again, so we cut it in pieces.
I'll tell you about my gift.<eos> All memories I create is here.<eos> Everything that goes into being there.<eos> There is no delete button.<eos> Nothing fades, nothing.<eos> All dirty. Shit.<eos> Every day I wake up and see my dying wife's face in front of me.<eos> So clearly and vividly as you can imagine.<eos> It's my gift.<eos> You'll be more than happy to take over it.
So he can feed 'em to his children on the moon.<eos> Why doesn't he feed them something else?<eos> Sam, everyone knows eyes taste the best.<eos> You think he'll steal mine?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But yours are still pretty small.<eos> He'd probably take mine first.<eos> - Lunar Base, over and out.<eos> You guys gotta keep this door locked tonight, OK?<eos> - I didn't touch it.
It's not important.<eos> Leave it for later.<eos> I have a lot.<eos> I brought two baskets full.<eos> I haven't done anything else but look for guavas.<eos> You're going to get well.<eos> We have much to do together.<eos> Many people to help.<eos> Give me your hand, my love.<eos> You feel it?
He's gone. He's gone.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Oh, you got a...<eos> Take your phone out.<eos> What?<eos> Take your phone out.<eos> Take your phone out.<eos> Okay.<eos> Pull up Cathy's number.<eos> Got it?
The drinks for 43<eos> This is us.<eos> Champagne.<eos> Welcome to Ibiza.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Hey, man, get out, get out.<eos> This is new music, I have to give it to him.
Ein tolles Apartment, echt.<eos> Yeah, pretty, is not it?<eos> And such a beautiful view.<eos> I put my things sometimes just in the bedroom, that's okay?<eos> No, the Deputy things only to the bathroom, I can now quickly clean up the bedroom.<eos> Are you still not gone?<eos> Get out on the spot.<eos> Get out!<eos> I have a surprise for you.<eos> Should I give it to you right?
What's so amusing?<eos> You are always about to write a book or about to decorate the bathroom or about to tell me something which will alter our lives forever.<eos> But you know what you are?<eos> A potential Nobel laureate?<eos> You are the postman who never knocks.<eos> And you know why that is?<eos> Please, darling, lighten my burden of ignorance.<eos> I'm not sure you've got any balls.<eos> When we met, you were part of the feminist Taliban and you insisted I contact my feminine side.<eos> Have I not contacted it sufficiently?

I actually want to go to a party.<eos> Come on, Meg!<eos> Meg, please.<eos> Fucking apologise!<eos> Why should I?<eos> You dressed up for him. You took him tea. You hung around wearing that scent.<eos> I love you, Meg.<eos> Take that seriously.<eos> Love dies.<eos> Only if you kill it.
Must I show mercy?<eos> It is a hard and narrow road we walk, isn't it?<eos> Until you can fill that hole you call your mouth, it would be difficult to rip out my heart.<eos> I am a knight, just like you.<eos> You are not here by choice, but that doesn't concern me.<eos> But if you try to stand in my way, I will kill you. I am of Royal blood!<eos> By birthright, maybe.<eos> Yes, you have blue blood running in your veins. So what?<eos> - The soul is something else.<eos> - And you are here to earn it.
Antonius sails against the pirates plaguing Crete.<eos> Pompey yet struggles with the renegade<eos> Sertorius inEspainia.<eos> The resources of the Senate are drained by these conflicts.<eos> We have not the men nor the coin to procure them.<eos> There is one among us who could fund endeavor from his own purse.<eos> And never feel sting of its cost.<eos> I had hoped to avoid involving the man.<eos> We would not be beholden to him any more than you, Metellus.<eos> Produce alternative, and we shall seize upon it.
What do they know?<eos> But he confessed.<eos> They might have tortured him. I don't know!<eos> Doesn't that happen sometimes?<eos> Damn!<eos> We did all this and now he's not even allowed to speak.<eos> No, we just have to wait.<eos> We're from a council estate. They won't let us help.<eos> Can you copy the hard drive for me?<eos> I think it's encoded.
I was interested in that.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I think I'll go out for a bit.<eos> No, stay with me.<eos> Please.<eos> - I don't want to be alone. - OK.<eos> - Are you alone? - Yes.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I sent Alain's credit card to your friend on holiday.<eos> I asked her to withdraw cash and pass it on.
- He's OK, thanks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Didier, listen to me.<eos> - Later.<eos> - It's important.<eos> In that case, tell me after a glass of champagne.<eos> I think this was my fault.<eos> I sent Vechborg all Alain's files and the threats.<eos> To be sure they'd read it, I said it was from you.
There is a lot of space up there.<eos> Say, it's burning?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> This is typical of London.<eos> And you survive I can hardly breathe.<eos> The maestro's health not robust.<eos> Oh, a handkerchief to the rescue<eos> - Yuck!<eos> Schauderhaft.<eos> The coal dust is good for the lung because he opens it.
Are you sure you should be drinking like this, Dom?<eos> I'm good, Mum.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> You've got to open a safe later and you haven't opened one in 12 years.<eos> I'm steady as a trapeze artist's cunt.<eos> - Let me see your hand.<eos> - What?<eos> Your hand.<eos> I want to see if you're really steady.<eos> Look at your own hand, Dickie, if you haven't lost it again.
- Yeah, it's peachy.<eos> - It's peachy.<eos> - This arrogant fucking wanker is trying to bugger our dead friend.<eos> Well, maybe we should bugger him.<eos> No, I don't think anybody should bugger anybody. - Yeah. - Come on, now.<eos> Come on, boys, boys, this is really my fault.<eos> He was just trying to get my necklace back.<eos> You--you're stealing from a dead man?<eos> - No-- - Technically, yes--<eos> Tony gave it to me, okay?
You have to tune him out.<eos> Oh, y... yeah, but then... this guy comes over, and he gets up in my face, and next thing I know, he... he rips my TV out of the wall, and he throw it out the window.<eos> - Are you going to arrest him?<eos> - Yes, he will be dealt with.<eos> All right, how about your meds?<eos> You take those today? - No.<eos> Forgot. - Okay, let's do that right now.<eos> That blanket's nice.<eos> Is that new?<eos> Yeah, I bought it at a yard sale. 50 cents.
I believe there a cremated human remains in it.<eos> Yep.<eos> Those are cremated human remains, all right.<eos> So what are we supposed to do?<eos> Did you contact the previous tenants?<eos> They were university students.<eos> They ran out on me two months' rent. I didn't wanna toss it in case the person mattered to someone.<eos> Someone was nice enough to cremate the body and, uh, pick out a lovely urn.<eos> It's very lovely.<eos> Okay, well, we'll hang on to it and store it in the properties room until I can track down a family member.
Let's get some nice iced coffees, and maybe a little brownie or something yummy,<eos> - and then we can go by all the A.T...<eos> - Okay, this is not a date. We are trying to get a menace off the streets.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you... thirsty?<eos> No. Just dropping off an abandoned urn.<eos> With ashes in it?<eos> Yeah. I'm gonna leave it here while I try to track down the family.
I'm joking.<eos> You need to learn how to ask questions.<eos> It's an art in itself, you know.<eos> I might be a diabetic, but that's not why I don't get it.<eos> Come in!<eos> The death of an informant is always complicated.<eos> We still don't know if Farid Benamar was ratted out by someone in the police precinct.<eos> Who found the body?<eos> Nadal, a television reporter.<eos> He discovered it on a knoll at Villeneuve, a suburb of Lille.
Mr. Davinier, what is the purpose of the law, in your eyes?<eos> To provide certainty where there otherwise might be none.<eos> Example?<eos> The Zong ship and those drowned.<eos> The law is one of the few trades acceptable to a gentleman.<eos> I have little but where my father relies on the Bible, I wish to rely on the law courts.<eos> And you aspire to the judiciary?<eos> One day, yes, my Lord.<eos> I wish to make the laws, for that is how I may truly change this world.<eos> That is I... I mean to say make it a better place.
For and Against at each other's throats.<eos> How on earth did the damn Quakers find their way in here?<eos> You are a brave man, negotiating these quarters on the eve of yourjudgment.<eos> Finally you are to speak.<eos> If England is destroyed, we shall blame you.<eos> ...religion not being the only guardian of our morality.<eos> Of course not.<eos> There is self-responsibility.<eos> And failing that, does the law not have a duty?<eos> Does the Bench and Parliament not have a duty to uphold and create the laws that progress our morality not retard it?
Take one of these just before.<eos> You'll feel like a horse.<eos> You're the man.<eos> - You're a pervert.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> What about you?<eos> Well, some girl took my pink pencil case.<eos> You're joking?<eos> Find out who did it?<eos> It took a while, but eventually I found it.
I don't know.<eos> Why I came in so often.<eos> For her, you were a customer.<eos> She didn't suspect you? No.<eos> I wish she had.<eos> I wish she'd wondered if there was someone.<eos> It'd have meant she cared.<eos> Lucie sent her our e-mails.<eos> How'd she get her address?<eos> Your wife gave it to her.
Ah! I understand now.<eos> Detective, Mr. Rojas will be continuing on with me.<eos> No.<eos> It's a jurisdictional issue.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Your efforts are duly noted.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> And if you're okay with everything, could you just close the door on the way out?<eos> Will you lay down and put your head in the door?<eos> I'll slam it about 157,000 times.
This asshole!<eos> Just take it easy.<eos> Hey, Pop.<eos> Hey, pork chop.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Look who it is!<eos> The rat's back in the house.<eos> Did you come back to arrest somebody else?<eos> You know, I saw Ma throw a can of Diet Coke in the garbage the other day.<eos> She didn't recycle it!
Maybe 12 hours, hopefully less.<eos> I have to find out what drives him.<eos> We could just beat him with a phonebook.<eos> No!<eos> For so many reasons, no.<eos> You just need to be patient, all right?<eos> It is crucial that you remain patient.<eos> It's also crucial that you stop wearing this stupid barrette.<eos> Don't!<eos> Just leave it.
I'm all in.<eos> Hey, how's it going?<eos> Jesus, you've got to get a mint in that dumpster.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Was I smoking cigarettes last night?<eos> Yeah, you kept taking them out of people's mouths and smoking them.<eos> God, that's so nasty!<eos> It was pretty gross.<eos> Why is my jacket in the pot?<eos> Don't worry. I'll get it right back.
What? Me? But what have I done?<eos> - So much for that lawyer of yours. Lets go.<eos> And you, indulgent father, "I want him to focus." You are making that child crazy!<eos> There's the door.<eos> Come on.<eos> What is it?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Is the bag in there?<eos> - Yes. No. Wait ...<eos> No bag, I don't see it.
You seem to know a lot about my family, my parents.<eos> So you can guess what it was like growing up.<eos> Marta sacrificed her childhood, her future to take care of me and Irwin.<eos> So ask me again how much I would sacrifice for her.<eos> (Newton) Ramos, your wife is here.<eos> How did you even get in?<eos> I still have friends here.<eos> Evie... evie, what are you doing here?<eos> What did you do with my jewelry box, huh?<eos> I looked for it everywhere and I couldn't find it.
Actually, no...<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Goodnight!<eos> Thanks.<eos> - It's cold.<eos> - Don't worry!<eos> It's cold.<eos> Put yourjacket on!<eos> - OK.<eos> - Put it on!
It's all totally improbable.<eos> What does "improbable" mean?<eos> - Almost impossible.<eos> - "Almost" is unrevolutionary.<eos> Not for the first time, I see people in a cafe.<eos> People have gathered, which seems normal enough, but here it's quite new.<eos> Let's try to hear what's being said inside.<eos> And to choose the best path for this revolutionary process.<eos> Democracy isn't born overnight.<eos> It must be constructed!
I don't know.<eos> It was your decision to sacrifice yourself for the plan.<eos> No.<eos> You said you had caused so much unintended damage, you felt this was your chance to make amends.<eos> You would not have it any other way.<eos> Do you remember getting a white tulip?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It was a sign from God.<eos> The tulip was important.<eos> I took it from the other timeline, and kept it.
You heard him.<eos> If he's captured, it's only a matter of time before they know we're here.<eos> Peter, start excavating that synchroscope.<eos> We need to go get the new initiator.<eos> And we need to gather everything that is required and leave.<eos> It's our only chance.<eos> Peter, how are you doing with the synchroscope?<eos> No synchroscope yet.<eos> But I found some sort of syringe.<eos> Any idea what that was for or why you had it?
He's in the number six stairwell.<eos> B-Unit, cover the 61st Street exit.<eos> Subject is moving on foot.<eos> Repeat, he's in the number six stairwell.<eos> He knows that we know.<eos> You're saying we can't complete the plan because we're missing one single piece?<eos> Without the initiating reactor there's no way we can open the wormhole.<eos> There's simply not enough energy.<eos> I thought the rocks provided the energy.<eos> To sustain the reaction, not to trigger it.
Different "schools".<eos> Techniques?<eos> What's wrong with you, boy?<eos> This smells like pee.<eos> Put it in the washer, come on!<eos> What kind of techniques? Well, I don't know.<eos> I remember when I was studying that...<eos> Mom!<eos> The sun burned the spearmint!<eos> You left it out in the sun, I told you not to
- You found the solution?<eos> - Yes. - Does that surprise you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You are Low-Frequency.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> What we know about frequency is wrong.<eos> Otherwise, you and I would never have met.<eos> You said you could help me.<eos> I can change your frequency.<eos> - Lower it?
You found the solution?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Does that surprise you?<eos> - Yes. You are Low-Frequency.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> What we know about frequency is wrong.<eos> Otherwise, you and I would never have met.<eos> You said you could help me.<eos> I can change your frequency.<eos> - Lower it?
It is a bit of a surprise.<eos> We expected his frequency to be above average, but it is exactly average, to 10 decimal places.<eos> The time has come for you to learn some family history.<eos> So, why don't we tell them?<eos> Because the masses prefer not to be self-aware, which by choice, puts them on a level with all their cousins in the animal kingdom.<eos> Want some flakes?<eos> Say "Thank you".<eos> - Maybe this isn't your instrument.<eos> - But it was perfect.<eos> Look, for hundreds of years, we have been the players, Theo, interpreting the score, evolving it.
You were brainwashed.<eos> It's imperative the Circle is not closed.<eos> The Count isn't as selfless as the Order believes.<eos> We know the truth...<eos> You lie every time you open your mouth!<eos> Gwendolyn.<eos> You're really here!<eos> Lucy.<eos> My necklace was given to you.<eos> Please take care of it.
And soon it's too late.<eos> The nights are getting colder.<eos> - Would you like some coffee?<eos> - No thanks.<eos> I just wanted to stop by.<eos> I went the little fast yesterday.<eos> Yes, I thought you would have some time alone with Gerlof.<eos> It was with the sandal.<eos> I see.<eos> I have sent it to the lab.
It gets expensive.<eos> At this time - This jacket is from Borgholm.<eos> Jasa.<eos> But if you like, you can...<eos> You may sleep here.<eos> LOCK THE DOOR AND ADD THE KEY IN MAT<eos> - Hello?<eos> - It is Gerlof Davidsson.<eos> I've got a little boy sandal by mail.<eos> And I think it is you who sent it.
Not a damn thing.<eos> And then I buried them Here at lime plain?<eos> No, we waited until the next day.<eos> For night.<eos> We buried them at the Western Wall on Marnas cemetery.<eos> It was horrible.<eos> It took us all night.<eos> It may not be visible the next day.<eos> And the sandal?<eos> I do not know why Martin kept it.
"East, wall, cellar, noon, Monday."<eos> Now that's a poem I can understand.<eos> All right.<eos> Present from a piano teacher to young Ludwig...<eos> "a clock of most exquisite decor."<eos> Well, wait.<eos> Our clock doesn't have a bust.<eos> - See?<eos> - Uh-huh, yeah.<eos> So that's why we couldn't neutralize it.
All right.<eos> Present from a piano teacher to young Ludwig...<eos> "a clock of most exquisite decor."<eos> Well, wait.<eos> Our clock doesn't have a bust.<eos> - See?<eos> - Uh-huh, yeah.<eos> So that's why we couldn't neutralize it.<eos> - We have to goo the other half. - Yes.<eos> All we have to do is find it anywhere on the planet earth.
I know you got the sack from your job...<eos> I mean, not the News At Ten one, but that other one.<eos> Well, their loss is my gain.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Well, good night, Martin.<eos> - Good night, Philomena.<eos> Hello, Caroline, it's Martin Sixsmith.<eos> I just wanted to check...<eos> Yeah, the file with the immigration cuttings?<eos> I know you checked it. Could you send that through?
All he does is go to class and come home.<eos> Just go to class and come home.<eos> Fall-back mode till end of watch.<eos> Now would be a good time to upgrade dispatch.<eos> We could always use cans and string.<eos> Sir, you all right?<eos> "Let us go and confound their language, "that they won't understand each other's speech.<eos> "And the Lord scattered them "across the face of all the earth,<eos> "and then they -- and then t-they built a city.<eos> "And therefore, it is called by the name of Babel!"
Maybe he tanked the tests on purpose.<eos> Well, What if he didn't?<eos> What kind of son are you if it turns out he's really sick?<eos> The kind that will spend the rest of my life wracked with guilt.<eos> I can't wait to find out.<eos> I need to know if he's faking it now.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> You're gonna have to watch the guy all day to know for sure.<eos> That's why I'm gonna use this teddy spy cam.<eos> One of my patients left it behind.
My wife was all I could think about.<eos> I'd sit in front of my typewriter and close my eyes, and I'd imagine this world.<eos> Then one day I opened my eyes. I was here.<eos> So it wasn't writer's block that created the artifact.<eos> It was grief.<eos> Yes, but our way out is still the same.<eos> Mr. Bishop, in order for us to get out of this world, we need to--well, we think we need to finish your story.<eos> Yeah, yeah, just tell us who did it, we'll bring 'em to justice, grab our elephant. Bingo bango, we all go home.<eos> No, I don't want this story to end.<eos> Stop trying to solve it.
-Bummer.<eos> You gotta try edging, man.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's where you jerk off, okay?<eos> Right to the point of orgasm and then stop.<eos> And you do this because...<eos> Because your jizz is your power, man.<eos> It's spiritual, it keeps your Chi inside.<eos> Especially if you got writer's block.<eos> You gotta walk right up to that line, bro, and not cross it.
Somewhere in here there's a hand grenade. Holy Jesus.<eos> Attached to a wire.<eos> Don't move any chairs. Or open any doors.<eos> Go easy, john boy, easy.<eos> Ah!<eos> Boys, no, there's nothing here.<eos> If it was in here, it would have blown by now.<eos> It was my name on that bullet Erasmus sent.<eos> He set up a trap all right.<eos> He set it upj ust for me.
You don't have time for this, Freddie.<eos> You did a deal for me.<eos> Don't flatter yourself.<eos> For Ada. And you think this copper will keep his word?<eos> If he does, you're safe.<eos> If he doesn't, Chapman will give you up. You'll still have to leave town, same result.<eos> - So neat.<eos> - So leave.<eos> Except there's one thing that you've got wrong,<eos> Stanley won't be able to give up my address because he doesn't know it.
It causes insecurity and anxiety.<eos> Consider it a good thing for you, given your line of work!<eos> Look, I work in a public clinic.<eos> Forgive him, he's a business lawyer, he tends to only focus on profits.<eos> You had to get on your soapbox...<eos> We were just chatting.<eos> - Where the hell is Serena?<eos> - Relax, she'll show up.<eos> I am relaxed.<eos> This salami looks appetizing, let me give it a try...
I can't laugh at everything you say.<eos> Either it's funny or it's not.<eos> I don't know how you can control yourself.<eos> It's hard sometimes.<eos> We talked about that, too.<eos> What exactly are you joking about?<eos> You're obviously not afraid that you're boring.<eos> What are the events in life?<eos> It's like you see a door.<eos> The first time you come to it you say,
- He was on assignment.<eos> On Waikiki Beach.<eos> How much work do you think you got done?<eos> Look at him.<eos> He has the sea breeze in his hair.<eos> You bring me something? Huh?<eos> Dictaphone, cocktail napkins?<eos> Anything to give me a jump on the Royal Hawaiian?<eos> I had an experience.<eos> I don't know how to put it into words.
Hey, Zal, did you make any friends today?<eos> Did you run into this chick?<eos> What's her name?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This violin belongs to my friend Sandy.<eos> Do you know when she'll be back?<eos> Sorry, Blondie, but that violin belongs to me.<eos> No, I know the girl who plays this violin and I'm looking for her.<eos> Yeah, no, I saw her.<eos> She sold it to me.
Yeah, you're a goodie. I can tell.<eos> Look at this.<eos> She's got 80 bucks.<eos> - Can I have it? - No.<eos> That's all they care about.<eos> Well, Miss Elizabeth Hofstadt Francis of Rye, New York, eyes blue, hair bottled, we don't like your life any more than you do.<eos> You have bad manners.<eos> You deserve to live in the street of this pigsty, and I hope you get tetanus or crabs or whatever else is crawling around here.<eos> Hey, that's my violin.<eos> She sold it?

I owe you an apology, Jude. More than an apology.<eos> There are no words for my regret.<eos> The devil... lives inside Sister Mary Eunice. You were right.<eos> I tried to cast it out, but I failed.<eos> In truth, it was an epic failure.<eos> She'll destroy everything. Why didn't I listen to you?<eos> Why was I so stubborn?<eos> She's destroyed you, and now she's destroyed me.<eos> My virtue is gone, Jude.<eos> She took it from me, violated me.
Did you ever think about having children after that?<eos> It was a different time for gay women.<eos> Most of us were resigned to not having children.<eos> But I was close to my friends' children.<eos> In fact, Kit...<eos> Kit Walker- he asked me to be godmother to his kids.<eos> He met a great girl named Allison down at the co-op.<eos> I don't know who loved her more... Kit or those kids.<eos> Kit always believed the kids were destined for great things.<eos> They grew up with that message, and they lived up to it.
Mr Shelby, you have to do something about him.<eos> Damn right, Harry.<eos> You pay the Peaky Blinders a lot of money for protection.<eos> You're the law around here now, Tommy, aren't you?<eos> Maybe you should put a bullet in Danny Whizz Bang's head like they do with mad horses.<eos> Maybe you'll have to put a bullet in my head someday, too.<eos> Bring the bill to the Peaky Blinders.<eos> We'll take care of this.<eos> Look at the gun.<eos> Recognise it?
We'll take care of this.<eos> Look at the gun.<eos> Recognise it?<eos> Oof! Get up off your arse, you mumping pig!<eos> Aunt Pol! What the fuck d'you do that for?<eos> ! Finn was playing with this this afternoon by the cut.<eos> It was loaded.<eos> He nearly blew Ada's tits off.<eos> It must've fell out of my pocket.<eos> He said he found it on the sideboard of the betting shop...
Detectives have been asking questions in the proofing shops.<eos> Nothing happens in that factory without you knowing about it.<eos> Speak. God and Aunt Polly are listening.<eos> It was meant to be routine.<eos> I had a buyer in London for some... motorcycles.<eos> I asked my men to steal me four bikes with petrol engines.<eos> I'm guessing my men were drunk.<eos> There's a still inside the factory makes tram-line gin.<eos> They picked up the wrong fucking crate.<eos> The boys dropped it at Charlie Strong's yard as agreed.
Okay, mom, that's enough.<eos> Well... what can I talk about?<eos> Hey, guys, what did the optimist say as he was jumping off a building?<eos> "So far so good."<eos> So far so good.<eos> So far so good.<eos> Hello.<eos> Have you seen the paper yet?<eos> No.<eos> You want me to read it to you?
Okay, go ahead.<eos> All right, now the headline is...<eos> "CIA officer linked to Langley bomber."<eos> "A CIA case officer may have had a sexual relationship with Congressman Nicholas Brody in the days and weeks leading up to the attack on Langley, according to anonymous sources.<eos> Because the officer still has active agents in the field, her identity is being withheld."<eos> We are pragmatists.<eos> We adapt.<eos> We are not keepers of some sacred flame.<eos> It doesn't have to be sacred.<eos> Just so long as we keep it lit.
Real fucking tough.<eos> Fucking cheese dicks. Enjoy your fucking game.<eos> See ya.<eos> Fuck you, mama boy.<eos> Hey, ladies, I wanna apologize for my bad language back there.<eos> How's the smoking?<eos> Fucking fine.<eos> Mmm. Can I try some of that fucking fine cigarette?<eos> That is fucking fine.<eos> You want it back?
I met you<eos> - Maybe I just expect too much.<eos> - Maybe you just expect the worst.<eos> - You scared me.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Thought the book was written<eos> - Thought the game had ended<eos> Thought the song was sung and I could never sing another<eos> Thought I knew this city Thought I knew all about it
Ask if we're far.<eos> How far are we from Columbus? Columbus, Ohio?<eos> 'Cause there's one in Indiana.<eos> That's not the one we want.<eos> You're about five hours.<eos> What's worth seeing around here?<eos> In Warsaw?<eos> We've got the second longest contiguous brick wall in the world.<eos> No kidding?<eos> A man from the university in Vincennes drove up and measured it.
- Okay.<eos> Calm down.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Look, it's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Here's what we're gonna do...<eos> Okay, we're gonna take all the bed linens from every motel room, and we're gonna use it to soak this all up.<eos> We're gonna wrap the body in one of the comforters, and we'll put it in a-- in one of the tubs in one of the motel rooms just-- just until I can figure out what to do with it tomorrow.
Well, boys take their father's names all the time.<eos> You know, it's almost 2:00 in the morning.<eos> Your son's got school tomorrow.<eos> You really think this is a good idea to--<eos> I had no idea it was that late.<eos> But thanks for letting me know.<eos> I'm gonna go close up shop.<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> Um...<eos> I just-- I scratched it with, um...
Watch your backs.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Frank Ashkani, you're under arrest for the murder of Tommy Sutter.<eos> You have the right to remind silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have the right to an attorney.<eos> If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you by the courts.<eos> - You did this to me.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> You kept the gun after the shooting. You planted my fingerprints on it, and you dropped it by the burial site.
Why?<eos> No sexual assault on the first victim.<eos> And nothing obvious taken.<eos> But he's gotta be taking something from them.<eos> Besides their sight?<eos> I'll put out the A.P.B. on the Cadillac.<eos> Let's get the M.E. to the hospital, look at her eyes.<eos> Make sure we're dealing with the same thing.<eos> This is where it all started.<eos> I came home, I closed the door and locked it, and then all of a sudden the floor was gone.
What the hell were you thinking? !<eos> I'm not gonna let you William tell an innocent man.<eos> You seem to think that mainly because of what's in you're damn book, which you apparently trust more than you trust me.<eos> And he explained to me that every name on that list<eos> I thought you took that book off your father's dead body.<eos> How can he have been so chatty?<eos> A few years ago, I found a message he left me explaining the list.<eos> Oliver, how is that possible?<eos> You were on a deserted island.<eos> I didn't say that I found it on the island.
Have you seen him lately?<eos> Oliver...<eos> He's been the ceo of Mervyn global group for years.<eos> I've been running Queen consolidated mere weeks.<eos> Yes, I occasionally go and ask for advice.<eos> Is my interrogation over?<eos> See, this is where we, detain prisoners prone to running off before I've finished with them.<eos> Prisoners like you, Mr. Queen.<eos> At Christmas one year, Tommy wanted a puppy.<eos> He wanted to name it Arthur, as in king Arthur, because he's a Merlyn.
Open his mouth.<eos> Get this down.<eos> Come on, help me!<eos> Force it in until he can bear no more.<eos> If he vomits, force more.<eos> Understand? But this is witchcraft.<eos> This is physio.<eos> Get to it.<eos> Do what she says, every detail.<eos> And if his soul departs, I shall ensure it does not do so alone.
I wish to know.<eos> Which cardinals owe favour to which other cardinals?<eos> Who is in whose pocket?<eos> Who seeks the papacy and who merely wishes an easy life'?<eos> - You know all this, do you not? -Stand fast.<eos> Yes, your father encouraged me to know all of this.<eos> -And?<eos> I have a list in my private apartments.<eos> - Names and notes. -Halt!<eos> Get it.
Our characters in Moondoor.<eos> Moondoor is a game that Ed and I play.<eos> We're Larpers.<eos> Live-action role-playing?<eos> Right.<eos> Larping.<eos> Good times.<eos> We play Moondoor every other weekend at Heritage Park.<eos> All the info about it is on our website. You guys have a website.<eos> Yeah, one of the players designed it.
If one of them screws up, I'm the one that has to act.<eos> I gotta take 'em to Ryder, maybe I got to get 'em fired.<eos> The responsibility is crushing me.<eos> You got the shoulders for it.<eos> I'm high.<eos> You got the runner's high?<eos> I got the runner want-to-throw-up.<eos> All right.<eos> You gotta cross that edge, you know?<eos> - I crossed it hours ago. - Agh.
All this time, I thought he left me.<eos> You thought that he was in Mexico?<eos> He talked a lot about packing it in and going down to Baja, and the Mohawk Police found his car parked on the Akwesasne Reserve the next day.<eos> I just figured he was on his way South.<eos> He'd been distant in the last couple of years.<eos> Some nights, he wouldn't come home, wouldn't say where he was.<eos> I got the text and just figured he'd moved on.<eos> - I moved on too.<eos> - Well, it's possible he never sent the text.<eos> Whoever killed him might have sent it to cover it up.
Maybe she killed Markussen to silence him.<eos> If she killed him, why is the card still missing?<eos> Ok, well, your read of the widow, Paula...<eos> She overheard Nick on the phone demanding money for the return of something that he stole.<eos> So the wife killed Nick in order to take over the blackmail herself?<eos> She's still a suspect, but our search didn't turn up the SD card.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You remember how Toby said that Nick was a hider, right?<eos> So we went to the storage locker, we looked at all the items, we even looked inside the items to see if we could find it... maybe he'd hid it.
No.<eos> Dean, no.<eos> We're not summoning a crossroads demon.<eos> Plan "A" bombed, so welcome to plan "B" -- we get some red-eyed bitch in a trap, then we hold a knife on her until she calls us in a pooch -- special delivery.<eos> Yeah, except when Crowley finds out we're dialing up hell, he won't send one Hellhound -- he'll send a hundred.<eos> That's not a plan, Dean -- that's suicide.<eos> Well, you got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, we stay here.<eos> I just talked to Alice in the barn.<eos> Carl didn't sell his soul for oil -- he sold it for Alice.
You will never get off Abafar, you and your little Republic friends, not after your Jedi cruiser blows up.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Why do you think the Separatists bother coming here?<eos> They are mining our Rhydonium to load on the shuttle and destroy your ride home.<eos> You will see.<eos> [laughing]<eos> Okay, let's see what we're up against.<eos> Gregor.<eos> Wait. There.<eos> And that shuttle, I think-- Yes, it's being loaded up with Rhydonium canisters.
Yeah, but you don't.<eos> Are you going somewhere? Uh...<eos> Uh... no. Just gym stuff.<eos> Weren't you coming back on the weekend?<eos> Well, I wanted to be here.<eos> So?<eos> Yeah? How was the hearing? Oh.<eos> Uh, I couldn't do it.<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> You skipped it?
You're crushing me, Mom.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's Abner.<eos> He--<eos> Oh, son.<eos> It is not uncommon for a dog to let loose a little gas every now and then.<eos> That, my friend, is exactly why we do not feed him people food from the table.<eos> That is wicked.<eos> No, it's not gas.<eos> I created this formula, and Abner drank it, and now he can talk.
Uh, I don't think so, no.<eos> Good, good, good, good.<eos> So this is what we're gonna do.<eos> Since one vial is already gone, you and Mr. Kane are gonna kidnap the talking dog so that we can analyze it and hopefully recreate the formula that you two idiots so foolishly let get away.<eos> Right.<eos> All right.<eos> What are we gonna do with the dog once you're done with it?<eos> Sadly we'll have to put the dog down so we can properly analyze it.<eos> There's just no other way.<eos> You will also acquire the remaining vial, and you will bring it to me.
You know what?<eos> You treat everybody here better than me.<eos> Even those witch ladies.<eos> Also not true.<eos> No, it is true.<eos> You let... You take them for walks and you...<eos> As I would take you if your faith required communion with nature.<eos> I don't want to walk! Okay?<eos> I'm gonna hang this damn cross!<eos> 'Cause it's my religious freedom and you're violating it!
Come on!<eos> We need to go back to motel.<eos> Policeman should have told us she was inside.<eos> - You didn't have to kill her.<eos> - She was out of control.<eos> Now, we need to get back to motel to count it.<eos> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 11,12,13, 14, 15,16,17,18, 19,20 bundles including the one you're holding.<eos> All hundreds.<eos> Not enough for what just happened.<eos> You take the cop's gun and you put it where no one will ever find it.

FIRST I STARTED SCREAMING, SO HE PUNCHED MY FACE.<eos> WHEN HE WAS DONE, I TOLD HIM, "I HAVE TO PEE."<eos> I THOUGHT MAYBE I WOULD RUN, I DON'T KNOW, NAKED SOMEWHERE,<eos> BUT HE OPENED THE DOOR, HE TOOK MY HANDS, HE HELD ME IN THE AIR. MY LEGS WERE IN THE CAR, AND HE TOLD ME, "OKAY, NOW PEE."<eos> HE TOOK OUT MASKING TAPE AND ROPE.<eos> HE TIED MY HANDS AND PUT THE MASKING TAPE ON MY MOUTH THAT I WOULDN'T SPEAK.<eos> AND THEN HE RAPED ME AGAIN LIKE THIS.<eos> I WAS SHOUTING.<eos> I FELT LIKE I WAS FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE.<eos> HE STARTED TO FREAK OUT AND TOOK A PLASTIC BAG AND PUT IT ON MY HEAD.
The priest?<eos> The priest?<eos> He went off with the chaplain.<eos> And the cross?<eos> What cross?<eos> Where is it?<eos> I've no idea, I swear, I've no idea!<eos> This parcel contains a priceless holy relic.<eos> It's Welsh gold, inlaid with sapphires.<eos> Someone wants to steal it.
Sooner than you'd think.<eos> We should be ready for human trials in two years' time.<eos> This afternoon.<eos> Preferably in the next half hour.<eos> I have a dinner engagement.<eos> I'm sorry, but, uh, well, that's impossible.<eos> I hear you like to get sauced at biochemistry conventions and brag about how you're gonna win the Nobel Prize for the work you're doing here, research that has been entirely funded by my late husbands money.<eos> I have made you rich soon to be famous.<eos> I want that medicine.<eos> I paid for it, and I want it.
This way. Thanks.<eos> Piece of garbage son of a bitch!<eos> Sir, I need to see your hands right now.<eos> Oh, you want to see my hands? Huh?<eos> Show me your hands.<eos> Here's my hands.<eos> Hey, drop the gun!<eos> You think I'm a coward?<eos> Drop the gun right now!<eos> Put it on the ground!
His business was never better.<eos> He was not suicidal.<eos> Your husband was distraught.<eos> Had he been drinking?<eos> He was 15 years sober.<eos> Had something happened recently?<eos> Why was he...<eos> Why was he carrying a gun?<eos> He did volunteer work a few weeks ago in a sketchy neighborhood.<eos> Maybe he had it for protection.
Just hang in there.<eos> Just stay with me, all right?<eos> Come on, Heather!<eos> Here, here, here. Great.<eos> That's great.<eos> Well done. Okay...<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Give it here. What? !<eos> Put pressure on it, and hold down.<eos> Keep holding it down.
So maybe we can trace back to where in the city The Count is... cooking up this garbage.<eos> Hey, we need to get you to a hospital.<eos> No.<eos> Oliver, God knows what was in that drug.<eos> It could be causing permanent damage.<eos> Felicity.<eos> Hey, they said you'd be up here.<eos> You look like something the cat dragged in.<eos> Not that there are cats in this building.<eos> Well, once a cat did get in, but a guard tazed it.
Glenn, Carl, the baby, whoever else is left.<eos> He'll save Rick for last so he can watch his family and friends die ugly.<eos> That's who you're dealing with.<eos> This is Mrs. McLeod.<eos> She's the one with arthritis.<eos> Well, thank you, dear, but we'll find another way you can help us.<eos> Noah's asthmatic.<eos> You ever shoot a gun, son?<eos> I had a BB gun once.<eos> My mom took it away.
I'll get the next one.<eos> What do you think happens when they return?<eos> We might have to slip out.<eos> Andrea made it out.<eos> If she's at the prison, it didn't do her any good.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - It's my turn.<eos> - Stay put.<eos> I got it.<eos> I got it.
You're still here.<eos> You're still alive.<eos> All right.<eos> Shit!<eos> All right.<eos> All right. Okay.<eos> Michonne.<eos> Hershel told me about the boy you shot.<eos> He had a gun.<eos> Was he handing it over?
I don't know what else to do.<eos> You need to protect yourself.<eos> Setraline to be continued.<eos> Slept a lot, no excessive anxiety.<eos> Now stable, he can go home.<eos> Yes?<eos> How are you, Mr Dabler?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I wanted to check this dosage.<eos> - Yes, I increased it yesterday.
No.<eos> Should I be, Professor Carroll?<eos> Smell it?<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> I'd like to teach you.<eos> Now first I like to gauge their fear.<eos> Listen to their breathing.<eos> You want to get in sync with it... make their breathing become yours.<eos> It's a way to connect to their heartbeat.<eos> Now first take the very tip of the blade, and you place it softly on their skin.
Okay, great.<eos> So that's it?<eos> There is one more thing the two of you have to do.<eos> Come with me.<eos> And there's one more thing you have to do too.<eos> Probably best if they don't know about this part.<eos> I wish I didn't know about this part either. Monroe.<eos> Almost ready.<eos> You got that last ingredient? Yup.<eos> Just getting it now.
Valerie... we only wanted to say to you that we'd like to thank you for the last two years and the 175 night shifts, you've taken...<eos> Thank you .<eos> And all the best for your birthday and...<eos> Hello, Spacko.<eos> I need a pizza.<eos> Yes, a spinach pizza and a six pack At the Hilf...<eos> Maria Hilf Hospital.<eos> Room 265 Did you write that down?<eos> All right.<eos> If the pizza is cold, I'll shove it up your ass.
- Come on.<eos> - I didn't eat it.<eos> - Are you fibbing me?<eos> - It hurts when I go.<eos> I don't want the chocolate anymore.<eos> Shit!<eos> Come on. We're leaving.<eos> Ronnie, she didn't eat the chocolate.<eos> Oh, you're fucking kidding me.<eos> - I gave it to her in the car.
Well, that's between Terry and Tracy.<eos> You sure?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Nothing.<eos> But, I'm glad you're hanging out with us, tonight.<eos> What are those?<eos> - You'll just make fun of me.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.<eos> These stones put out special energy, all I'm doing is focusing it.
You lose, we don't merge.<eos> You win, you get what you want.<eos> You lose, you stay. You extend your noncompete, and you get a chance to earn your name on the door, because it's not going up there now.<eos> There's no room for both of us.<eos> Unless we made room for each other.<eos> I put him on the list, and I handed it in.
Okay.<eos> And what would clean look like? Don't even think about it.<eos> I can't not think about it, all right?<eos> It's all I've been able to think about for two days.<eos> Mike, why are you here?<eos> Because that's not going to happen.<eos> Now or ever?<eos> You lied to me about everything.<eos> Rachel-- Do you remember when I told you I needed time?<eos> That's what I needed it for-- to process this bomb that you dropped on me.
Well, that's all well and good, Mr. Specter, but I have one question.<eos> Why should I hire you?<eos> Because you trust Edward Darby.<eos> I'm afraid that only gets you in the room.<eos> This civil servant seems to have a personal vendetta against me, and I don't even know why.<eos> Well, I do.<eos> He needs a head on a platter.<eos> Why mine?<eos> You've been skirting environmental laws for a decade.<eos> He's got a chance to nail you, and he's gonna take it.
That's a stupid goddamn question, and you know it.<eos> I never had that chance, so what does it matter?<eos> Because I do.<eos> I wanna give this office back.<eos> I didn't earn it, I don't want it, and if there's a chance it'll help Harvey forgive me, I'm gonna take it.<eos> Oh, and, uh, if you ever do send that letter, you're in the same boat as me.<eos> Harvey, you're looking determined.<eos> - I am.<eos> - What can I do for you?<eos> Look, I know we had an arrangement, but I came here to change it.

What with these toasters and mixers and such like, we'd be out of a job.<eos> I want to try it.<eos> Then on your own head be it!<eos> Did you like your card, Ivy?<eos> What's it to you?<eos> That'd be telling. Don't listen.<eos> He's just teasing.<eos> Come on. Clear out, you two.<eos> There's work to be done.<eos> Do you think that means that Jimmy sent it?
When you were his age,<eos> Don't worry, I'll deal with it.<eos> You can't do anything.<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean I can't?<eos> I mean...<eos> Honey.<eos> Focus the energy here.<eos> Right here.<eos> Do you feel it?
Don't worry, I'll deal with it.<eos> You can't do anything.<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean I can't?<eos> I mean...<eos> Honey.<eos> Focus the energy here.<eos> Right here.<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> Yes... I think I feel it.
My father wasn't really the outdoorsman type.<eos> Too busy managing his stock portfolio, huh?<eos> Owned a hardware store.<eos> Never made it past the 7th grade.<eos> But he knew his tools.<eos> Well, sounds like my Norman Rockwell upbringing.<eos> My father was a drunk.<eos> Angry, mean drunk.<eos> There was nothing idyllic about my childhood.<eos> Except that maybe I survived it.
And you have questions.<eos> Just one actually.<eos> What are you fighting them for?<eos> Resources, territory?<eos> A flower -- the Catarius.<eos> It blooms on my homeland when the weather begins to warm.<eos> A flower that is... So valuable that it's caused an intergalactic war?<eos> The Catarius has no value to anyone except me.<eos> Something you remember from your childhood?<eos> Actually, I have never seen it.
What are we waiting for?<eos> I got word to hold a minute.<eos> Okay, you're right.<eos> I can do this.<eos> Get off.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, call me when you get eyes on the liver.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It looks good so far, Bailey.<eos> Now remember, once we get it out, we're only 50 minutes out.
Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> I'm out.<eos> I am proposing that we close your E.R.<eos> What?<eos> We're a level 1 trauma center.<eos> We're a hospital.<eos> In the last three days, your E.R. went from being in shambles to peak efficiency.<eos> Well, then why would you propose cutting it?
I'm hoping she'll talk to you.<eos> You okay?<eos> You want to talk about this?<eos> I really don't.<eos> Who shot the gun?<eos> I did.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought I saw an intruder.<eos> Where's the gun?<eos> He took it with him.
Kiera didn't send me.<eos> You know I had a job like this once, way back... or is that way forward?<eos> Mopping floors and cleaning toilets.<eos> Good, honest work my father called it.<eos> I hated that job but I guess it did teach me something.<eos> And what's that?<eos> Well first off, money and power doesn't mean your shit doesn't stink.<eos> More importantly, the only thing separating me and the future I wanted was will.<eos> I had the talent and the ambition, all I needed was a chance.<eos> The problem is, of course, you're rarely given that chance, more often than not you've gotta take it.
This again.<eos> You're not gonna shoot me.<eos> You'd have already pulled that trigger.<eos> You've been busy.<eos> Take off the suit, you might live!<eos> You don't need that uniform.<eos> Need.<eos> Want.<eos> Semantics.<eos> Put it down, and you get to walk away.
Not my keeper.<eos> I worry about you.<eos> These people...<eos> These people have emancipated themselves from the slavery of the system.<eos> Your system.<eos> It's the same story every time, Hannah.<eos> Please...<eos> Please let me help you.<eos> I don't want your help!<eos> I don't need it!
Well, if it isn't, someone sure wanted it to look that way.<eos> Looks like they never saw it coming.<eos> So, on top of civil unrest and a drug epidemic, you're telling me I've got a gang war on my hands?<eos> I'm not sure we know enough to call it a gang war just yet.<eos> You must have a working theory?<eos> Well, the Kings have been trading hits with the Syndicate for the last 14 months.<eos> Wolford's out on bail, maybe he's trying to get payback for whoever set him up?<eos> Whatever these guys did, someone's trying to eradicate them for it.<eos> This city's teetering on the brink.<eos> This might just be enough to push it over the edge.
I assure you, if you elect me mayor, I will launch a full investigation into the clear, and obvious corruption of our court system.<eos> A dangerous individual like Julian Randol is free to roam the streets?<eos> It's time for a drastic change.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Carlos!<eos> - What the hell was that, Jim?<eos> - I intend to find out.<eos> Somebody got to that judge.<eos> Well, if that's true, there will be a trail.<eos> We just have to find it.
It's just, four people and a dalmatian in this loft... things might get a little... cramped.<eos> I know.<eos> We'll get creative.<eos> Or... we could get our own place.<eos> You wanna do what?<eos> You wanna move out? Whoa! I... it's just a suggestion.<eos> After 28 years, isn't this what we've all been waiting for, to be together under the same roof?<eos> Yes. I just... imagined a bigger roof... with turrets.<eos> Being here in Storybrooke, we have a chance at a fresh start.<eos> Let's take it.
I'll relist it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, and no sign out in the front.<eos> I still need to earn a living until it gets sold.<eos> Of course.<eos> Norman, that short story you turned in, it's incredible.<eos> - It is?<eos> - It is.<eos> You should be really proud.<eos> In fact, I have a friend who has a small literary publication, and I'd like to send it to him.
♪ Oh, May ♪ put your arms around me ♪ what you feel is what you are ♪<eos> Where are you guys working?<eos> Gil's dry dock.<eos> Want some veggies?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> ♪ Oh, May, wanna get married ♪ ♪ or run away?<eos> Did you get my message?<eos> Something about flowers.<eos> Yeah, I saved the card.<eos> How do you know he sent this? - Well, who else would it be?
What are you waiting for?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Everything is just how he left it.<eos> I didn't think it would hit me like this.<eos> - You want a minute?<eos> I like having you here.<eos> He had this old, beautiful, gold pocket watch.<eos> And when I was little, we would wind it up together.

By the time I started, when he was four, he was up to 16 feet long, and weighed 4,000 pounds.<eos> (MAN CHATTERING OVER PA) I had actually seen Tilikum quite a number of times. He was right across the street here in Victoria.<eos> (MAN CHATTERING OVER PA) BALCOMB: All Sealand was a net hanging in a marina with a float around it.<eos> Tilikum was the one we really loved to work with.<eos> He was very well behaved and he was always eager to please.<eos> When he was first introduced, everything just went fine and dandy.<eos> But the previous head trainer used techniques that involved punishment.<eos> He would team a trained orca up with Tilikum, who was untrained.<eos> He would send them both off to do the same behaviour.<eos> If Tilikum didn't do it, then both animals were punished.
Rumplestiltskin says that magic has a price, but from where I'm sitting, seems that science does, too.<eos> Every time I try to save a life, someone else dies.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look, you're Frankenstein, and I'm the werewolf.<eos> I ate my boyfriend.<eos> Regina thought she was punishing us by erasing who we were.<eos> But I think she underestimated how much crap we wanted to forget.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But... we can't let it stop us.<eos> She gave us a chance to start over, and I wanna take it.
It's a cup.<eos> You were afraid that you had angered me. Here.<eos> You... you need to go and take your cup, okay?<eos> No, no, no, no. I...<eos> I charmed it.<eos> If you focus, it will work.<eos> It's magic.<eos> Okay, just go away.<eos> S... stop talking about magic and take your cup.<eos> Just look at it.
We find ourselves heavy with Roman coin.<eos> What cost would sober intent?<eos> Five thousand denarii would see me far from this city, and shores of fucking Republic.<eos> A bargain well struck.<eos> Call me Roman no more, then!<eos> How many more swords do you need?<eos> Those that join us are well armed.<eos> Join you?<eos> You move to take the fucking city? !<eos> We move to liberate it.
What of a mind keen enough to amass it?<eos> Upon our first meeting you spoke of dealings with Crassus.<eos> I would know of anything ear may have caught.<eos> Such knowledge will not reverse sun, nor alter the course of river's fate.<eos> Then there stands no reason to deny request.<eos> Our business with Crassus concerned only grain and shipment, nothing more.<eos> Yet my husband imparted story, shared by Aedile of Neapolis towards future dealings.<eos> The man was thick in negotiations with Crassus when he intercepted message from reviled competitor, offering more favorable terms to Crassus.<eos> While seeing both profit and valuable client soon to vanish, the Aedile burned errant message, swiftly agreed to Crassus' demands.<eos> Only to discover months later Crassus himself had sent the message, intending for the Aedile to lay hands upon it, and move in direction desired.
Present your fates.<eos> No, no, fuck!<eos> You cannot do that!<eos> Apologies there is so little.<eos> Food grows scarce.<eos> You risk life for us.<eos> There is no more we can ask of you.<eos> See heart lifted with welcomed news.<eos> Crassus and his legions are but a day's march from our city.<eos> He will retake it, and in the act end our suffering...
I would have leave of this fucking city.<eos> As would I.<eos> Gannicus.<eos> I thought you for the ridge.<eos> I did not wish to leave without words.<eos> Would that I could stop them.<eos> Before you came to the city, I prayed to the gods that they would deliver me from the hands of my dominus.<eos> And in you my prayers were answered.<eos> I have heard this tale before.<eos> And found it equally misguided.
Mine is forever entwined with your own.<eos> I stand moved by sentiment.<eos> As I do by the way you've afforded yourself of late.<eos> You honor me, Imperator.<eos> You honor yourself in deed and action.<eos> I would see such spirit greet newest command.<eos> Speak it, and see it done.<eos> I wish this chest spirited from sight.<eos> A simple task, yet one of grave importance.<eos> Where shall I place it?
You wish to fight?<eos> Killing Romans was how I gained your trust, was it not?<eos> Perhaps if enough fall to my blade, your brothers shall one day be so moved...<eos> It is a decision removed from my hands.<eos> But know that thought is well received.<eos> I did not think to lay eyes upon you again.<eos> Nor I you.<eos> The gods mock us both.<eos> You are still of this world.<eos> Yet shall slip from it if you do not eat.
I had feared you among the dead.<eos> The gods took pity, and provided us with needed shelter.<eos> Not all so blessed.<eos> They were not.<eos> We sought aid from the heavens.<eos> To see us beyond darkness of trench and wall.<eos> And here stands reply.<eos> Yet in their cruelty, perhaps the gods light way for those yet living.<eos> You turned from fucking reason.<eos> I have embraced it.
He stands prisoner with a clutch of his soldiers.<eos> I will have his fucking life.<eos> The reason he yet clings to it.<eos> Let us build pyre and gather around imagined sands of storied arena.<eos> To bear solemn witness to the clash of sword and shield.<eos> And pay final tribute to the Undefeated Gaul.<eos> Who shall forever stand so in my eyes.<eos> There was a time not along ago when he turned from you.<eos> A thing I moved him towards.<eos> The past is seldom as we would have it.
Yeah, well, we can find him on our own.<eos> How's that?<eos> Teddy here's part Cherokee.<eos> Family came here on the Trail of Tears.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're gonna find who did this, and when we do, we ain't gonna arrest him, like you will.<eos> Well, it's gonna be tough tracking anyone with Teddy in jail for statutory rape.<eos> I already told you.<eos> Repeating a lie don't make it true.
Heroin.<eos> It's got to be heroin.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Hold it.<eos> Come on. God damn it.<eos> You were saying?<eos> You and Johnny get the name?<eos> We did narrow them down to 13 men.<eos> Soon as Colton gets back from Audrey's, we're gonna go knocking on doors.<eos> Well, I got another idea, if you'd like to hear it.
Amen.<eos> I thought I might find you here.<eos> I took it on myself to make sure the body wasn't disturbed.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> Sergeant, secure the scene.<eos> And get the police surgeon down here.<eos> I want a provisional theory as to cause of death.<eos> The colouration on the face would suggest cyanide poisoning.<eos> I think I can take it from here.<eos> Very well, Inspector, I'll leave it to you.
Probably best.<eos> Besides, we have more urgent matters to discuss.<eos> Our friend in Rikers.<eos> I have the situation in hand.<eos> I don't want you crossing some kind of line to do...<eos> This?<eos> Already deleted them from the network too.<eos> That line you're talking about, I crossed it a long time ago.<eos> Now we have to deal with the DNA sample.<eos> FBI keeps it in a secure lab here in New York.
Even if it meant breaking the law?<eos> The law be damned.<eos> So I did what any father would do.<eos> I took my child out of harm's way.<eos> Bobby...<eos> Please look at me.<eos> Is any of what Ryland said out there true?<eos> Some of it.<eos> I need Emma to hear my truth, Bobby.<eos> I need you to hear it.
So that's a yes?<eos> - Yes. - And you are familiar with the booster scandal, docteur?<eos> Yes, I'm the one who discovered it.<eos> - And the new compound, dexitetrasolone.<eos> - Uh-huh. And after you discovered it, did you test this... substance?<eos> No.<eos> We're still waiting on subpoenas of private labs<eos> - in China who manufacture it.<eos> - I see, so... you have never seen this mysterious substance.<eos> You have never held it, never tested it.
The second and third floors are for bank customer parking only.<eos> Ms. Tascioni was arrested on...<eos> The third floor stairwell.<eos> ...in the third floor stairwell.<eos> Okay, here's how we're doing things.<eos> The four of you get all of your whispering out of the way.<eos> Go and discuss everything you want to discuss outside the court.<eos> Come back in here in 20 minutes with your best arguments.<eos> And Ms. Pine?<eos> I have to say this. I'm inclined to toss this arrest, 'cause I, too, think it's stupid.
And, uh, every day there was something new, meaner and meaner.<eos> Most of them were just followers, but there was that one-- Kirk Breslin.<eos> Julian Hunt.<eos> And then one day I decided to be mean.<eos> I just told that bully piece of shit that he'd never be anything, do anything, or amount to anything.<eos> After that, they never made fun of me again.<eos> In fact, they, uh... They never talked to me again.<eos> Right.<eos> I shouldn't have impugned Baden-Baden.<eos> It's just that when I asked you if you took mud, I was... Offering a warm, muddied hand of friendship, and you took that hand and wiped it clean.
Well, somebody did because Darby found out what I gave Mike, and I just got fired.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> Well... At least there's that.<eos> Good-bye, Harvey.<eos> And then we just toasted to it, one hatchet man to the other.<eos> Wow, Louis.<eos> That's the sweetest story I've ever heard.<eos> - I broke my word.<eos> - What?<eos> I put him on the list, and I handed it in.
Except Stillwater Imports doesn't appear to have any ongoing business activity.<eos> This is a shell corporation.<eos> I'll keep looking into it, but whatever Stanton's after, I bet it's in there.<eos> You're going to the 21st floor.<eos> The elevator only goes to 20.<eos> The access pad.<eos> Enter this code, 0-5-1-5-7-3.<eos> What's up there?<eos> The 21st floor is a level 5 DOD facility.<eos> Unfortunately, the men guarding it won't leave it for something as routine as a bomb threat.
Off the wing, now!<eos> Bang me the fuck up!<eos> All right, all right, fella.<eos> Fucking wankers.<eos> Get me off this fucking wing!<eos> Open the fucking gate!<eos> Open the fucking gate! Open the fucking gate now!<eos> Open the fucking gate!<eos> Bang me up right fucking now!<eos> Open it!
If you take him to the hospital, they don't have it.<eos> The greatest doctor in the world can't make it.<eos> Only I can give it to him, and I will.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> If I give it to him, he will be fine.<eos> But if I don't, he'll die in 72 hours.<eos> That's exactly what'll happen if you don't do what I tell you to do.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I need something from you, and it's a little thing really.<eos> I need you to go to your boss's study tomorrow and take the little, electric clock from the bookshelf and bring it to me.

Go.<eos> Blue.<eos> Blue.<eos> I'm Agent Beeman with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> I'll make this fast in case your people are watching you.<eos> You're trading extremely expensive caviar for high-end stereo systems at a store on Calvert Street.<eos> The clerk's also putting US currency into the components for you.<eos> Here's what I think.<eos> You're stealing the caviar from your embassy.<eos> You've got access to a diplomatic pouch, and you're using it to ship the stereos and the currency back to your family at home.
It's called an elevator.<eos> Don't be scared.<eos> C'mon.<eos> It's a magic flying box.<eos> Step in.<eos> Come.<eos> Dee!<eos> Where's Dee?<eos> Get over here, child.<eos> Dee, take off that uniform, put an iron to it, and if you're not ready to go in five minutes, I'm sending you back on the next boat!
Deb, I'm your brother.<eos> I didn't want to hate you.<eos> I wanted the opposite.<eos> But it didn't work out that way.<eos> I can't change the way I feel.<eos> Will you-- will you go, please?<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter, get the fuck out.<eos> Go.<eos> Deb doesn't want my help, and Vogel is demanding it.
He'd just beaten the shit out of me.<eos> I was a little fucked up.<eos> Why didn't you call the police?<eos> I didn't know what I could tell them.<eos> You could have called me.<eos> You're the one that gets me into trouble, not out of it. Is that why you lied to me?<eos> All of a sudden we have a problem with lying?<eos> We found a gun in El Sapo's glove box. Is it yours?<eos> Shit, it might be, yeah.<eos> He took it off of me before he beat me up.

Well, I just walked up, and the front door is open.<eos> Get in your car and stay there.<eos> If someone was inside when you called, he's still in there.<eos> I haven't seen anyone leave.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Thank you, Dexter.<eos> Are you sure there's no one inside? I checked the entire house.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> That DVD, it's not mine.<eos> Put it in.
Don't forget to breathe.<eos> You went to see Galuzzo?<eos> You could have exposed us both. It was worth the risk.<eos> He's definitely hiding something.<eos> So now what?<eos> I break into his house tomorrow, when he's at work, try to find hard evidence that he's our man.<eos> And in the meantime, what if he comes for me?<eos> Do you have any way to protect yourself?<eos> A gun.<eos> I haven't used it for years.
Oh, my God, why won't you just admit that you like her and that I am an awesome matchmaker?<eos> I'll admit that you're an awesome nanny.<eos> You'll have to settle for that.<eos> We'll revisit this after the date.<eos> Oh, by the way, the TV remote has been missing since yesterday.<eos> I think somebody hid it, but I can't get anything out of him.<eos> Harrison, did you take the TV remote?<eos> No.<eos> - Do you know where it is?<eos> He says he didn't take it.
I know.<eos> I know. You tried to tell me.<eos> So does that mean you care about me?<eos> Only to the extent that you sign my paycheck.<eos> Touche.<eos> Okay, what are we going to read tonight?<eos> Let me guess. "Wee Monkeys."<eos> "Wee Monkeys."<eos> Before I read to you, I gotta talk to you about the TV remote.<eos> You said you didn't take it, but Jamie found it under your bed.

- Let's go see Hannah.<eos> ...it is necessary at this time for all passengers - to exit the boarding area... - Clear this area right now.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Put Elway on the no-fly list.<eos> Unfortunately, now we're not flying either.<eos> Come on, bud.<eos> All right, let's move her.<eos> Pretty quick.<eos> His gun is missing too.<eos> We're going to assume Saxon still has it.
I'm afraid I'm unable to help you if you're unwilling to help yourself.<eos> Feel free to show yourselves out.<eos> I knew this was a mistake.<eos> The only mistake being made here is yours.<eos> Father's friend or not, Matt Duncan is a murderer.<eos> If you don't call him out, Carl loses his dad, and I lose my husband...<eos> Assuming I even get to call you that before they lock you up.<eos> After the Northridge Quake, my father was inspired to use the profits from our military contracts to create a privatized disaster-relief firm.<eos> Stonehaven and its employees meant everything to my father.<eos> And I'm not interested in handing it over to someone with plans to break it up and sell it for parts.
Anybody here?<eos> Deanna!<eos> Hey, you at my house?<eos> Just got here.<eos> I'm gonna be late.<eos> You can start supper if you want.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Bye!<eos> I need you to get that equipment ready.<eos> I'm flying it up to the mine first thing in the morning.
What the hell happened to you?<eos> Late night?<eos> Well, I just got a call from Twin Lakes Airline.<eos> And?<eos> You're not gonna believe this.<eos> Why are they still holding on to her?<eos> They are convinced that Deanna and Jonas were working together.<eos> Well, can't you get her out on bail or something?<eos> Jonas told the cops about another bomb, and it was wired to the ignition in Dearman's car.<eos> They disarmed it, but there might be attempted murder charges.
Some help!<eos> Get something to prop the door open.<eos> Help!<eos> Help me push the door open.<eos> - Got it? - Yeah!<eos> They got the door open.<eos> Down to a minute. A minute!<eos> What happened?<eos> It's stuck on another crate!<eos> Okay, just move the crate back, slide it to the side.
But a year under Harvey Specter, they would kill to have you.<eos> And you wouldn't be the only one.<eos> There are people from Pearson Hardman going to Bratton Gould? Who?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> Jimmy, you have to tell me that.<eos> Mike, come on.<eos> If they knew it came from me--<eos> They won't.<eos> I saw Clark and Owens meeting with our partners.<eos> If you're here to give me your letter of resignation, I'll accept it in the morning.
And I voted to oust him once I knew.<eos> Once you knew you had to save your own ass.<eos> All right, you know what, Harvey, just get out.<eos> Get out.<eos> Ri-- I did nothing wrong.<eos> Jesus!<eos> You bugged my office.<eos> You ran to Hardman about the CM lawsuit.<eos> You sold your soul for senior partnership.<eos> And once you got it, you created a drug policy with the sole purpose of firing me!
You said it yourself.<eos> The deal's too good to be true.<eos> The financials don't support it.<eos> What, you get your MBA overnight? No.<eos> You went to Louis?<eos> We worked all night.<eos> He didn't betray us, Harvey.<eos> He found the problem.<eos> They never wanted anything to do with Trent's company.<eos> After the deal, they're just gonna sell it off for spare parts.
- I didn't think it was.<eos> I got to give it to your man Harvey.<eos> He comes full throttle.<eos> He has his pros and cons.<eos> They all do.<eos> Did you bring your checkbook?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I brought this.<eos> You're going to decertify our class?<eos> I'm gonna bust it wide open.
Held her from behind, nicked her spinal cord several times.<eos> It takes a lot of strength to do that while the victim's fighting.<eos> He hating on working girls?<eos> Maybe just this girl?<eos> 'Cause she wouldn't swallow? Wow.<eos> You speaking from experience?<eos> We'll call you when we get a hit on the prints.<eos> And, uh, good luck on the sergeant's exam, Holder.<eos> Thanks, doc.<eos> He hasn't passed it yet.
Done... and done.<eos> You want a soda or something?<eos> Yeah, diet, if they got it.<eos> Watching the weight.<eos> Yeah, not me.<eos> Good on you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You got a case file?<eos> Yeah, yeah, just got to sign off on some of the paperwork.<eos> Uh, I'll get it back to you.
We got the killer three years ago, put him away.<eos> End of story.<eos> And now they're gonna execute him.<eos> I'm guessing you heard.<eos> What do you want, Holder?<eos> I was thinking I'd take a look at your old case file, just make sure there's no connection between your crack ho and mine.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Go for it.<eos> The thing is, the storage says the box is already checked out.<eos> And they don't know who took it.

Looking good, Linden.<eos> Hey, Holder.<eos> Not every victim's worth it.<eos> You know, you start caring... you'll end up like me working minimum wage on a ferry.<eos> Never thought the day would come I'd hear that from you.<eos> Moving day, Seward.<eos> You're being transported to "C" block three miles down the road.<eos> Should we get stopped by somebody trying to remove you from state custody, we will shoot you first right where you sit.<eos> Better enjoy the view.<eos> Last time you'll see it.
Sarah?<eos> Sarah!<eos> Did she have any rings on her fingers?<eos> Nope.<eos> Damn, Linden.<eos> What the hell are you doing here in the middle of the night, sneaking around in the dark?<eos> I was returning the file you forgot at my place.<eos> That's where it was.<eos> - Yeah. - I've been looking all over for it.<eos> I thought I lost it.
You know, clock never stops.<eos> Digging around down in storage halfway to China, still no Seward file.<eos> Well, it sounds like you have a long night ahead of you.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You miss it?<eos> What?<eos> No, I mean, I didn't really look.<eos> No?<eos> Not curious at all?<eos> Just opened it up, closed it real quick, brought it right back?
- He said it, didn't he?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Brendan.<eos> Last night.<eos> He said tomorrow was a big day, he needed you to have his back, and that the rats were on him.<eos> Brendan was blackout drunk.<eos> He was talking about Internal Affairs and you know I'm right. - You need to calm yourself.<eos> - I need to know what's going on.<eos> What--<eos> What is going on is that you wanted your revenge, so you took it.
Hey you!<eos> Shoes!<eos> Shoes!<eos> Shoes!<eos> My man!<eos> That's what I call a conviction!<eos> I already bought lots!<eos> Check this out.<eos> This is a Blackberry Torch, my man!<eos> Give me your number, I lost it.
Until Sunday night.<eos> Great.<eos> I need to get something from the car.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'll leave the door ajar.<eos> - OK.<eos> The other day, I was walking on a dirt track with small stones.<eos> The stones made my steps seem loud.<eos> Every single step.<eos> I wanted to eat my orange and took it out of my bag.

I started to peel it.
Yes, you did. You do this all the time.<eos> You just throw numbers at me to frighten and confuse me.<eos> And here I thought we were working so well together, and you're just being manipulative.<eos> What about you, Cam?<eos> Pitching these crazy, over-the-top ideas just so you can slip in what you really want.<eos> Oh, how dare you accuse me of Trojan horsing you.<eos> You have a name for it?<eos> No, I mean--<eos> You know what? I will not stand here and be accused by the likes of you.<eos> And if there was a door here, missy, I would slam it your face.
Hello, pretty lady.<eos> What do you wanna do for dinner?<eos> How about we exchange the baby for a cheese pizza?<eos> - Is this about today?<eos> - I'll call for those tickets.<eos> You were supposed to spend quality time with the baby.<eos> Joe was asleep.<eos> He didn't even know he missed the puppet show.<eos> It was the baby class!<eos> Okay, call it what you want.
Can't go wrong with Wicked.<eos> Sure.<eos> Then again, Mamma Mia.<eos> Oh, I can never see that show enough.<eos> I own the movie on Blu-ray.<eos> Two words.<eos> Delightful romp.<eos> You do realize the whole point of this trip is to tell the woman I love that I'm actually someone else?<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> If that story was on Broadway, I'd see it in a heartbeat.
We can't screw this up.<eos> It's all we have.<eos> This heat is amazing.<eos> Mother of God! That's hot.<eos> There are bears out there.<eos> - They're coming this way.<eos> - What?<eos> Max, get in here!<eos> Close the door!<eos> Fine, but they'll just open it and come in.
- But this is our home now.<eos> - You never think about going back?<eos> Of course we do.<eos> It's just not possible.<eos> We have no way to get there.<eos> How's the farmland here?<eos> Pretty good.<eos> Why?<eos> The stem is from a beanstalk.<eos> If I plant it, it should be able to grow some magic beans.
That's, uh a lot to confide in me, Moira.<eos> Robert did.<eos> I know he reached out to you, whether I was supposed to know it or not.<eos> He had misgivings.<eos> He sought you out because he knew you did too.<eos> But then he was murdered.<eos> And that should be a cautionary tale for both of us.<eos> Yes, I know. And I've gone along with this for as long as I can stomach it.<eos> We started this to fix the Glades, Frank.<eos> To cure the city, not lay it to waste.
So I'm getting a good signal from the GPS I put in your family's brooch.<eos> I can track it on my phone.<eos> Speaking of, have you given any thought to what might happen if this doesn't work and the Dodger absconds with your family jewels?<eos> I'm sorry, that came out very wrong.<eos> Let's just keep our eyes open, Felicity.<eos> Hey, isn't that...?<eos> Mm-hm. I would rather take my chances with a deadly jewel thief.<eos> Right.<eos> Hey, that brooch was donated by the Queen family.<eos> If you want it, you're gonna have to bid.

He was hoping to use my trick in his big bamboozala festival tonight.<eos> Well, it doesn't look like he'll be bamboozaling tonight after all.<eos> Monty, if you knew Mr. Preston was trying to steal your trick, then why use him as a volunteer?<eos> Because he'll go nuts trying to figure it out.<eos> And you know why?<eos> It's not a trick.<eos> It's real magic.<eos> Well, look, that's kind of why we're here, Monty.<eos> We need you to hand over whatever it is you're using to levitate these people.<eos> You don't hand over magic. You earn it.
He's got a partner.<eos> And Myka doesn't know that.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Detective, I have the jawbone.<eos> Look, I don't want any trouble.<eos> Okay?<eos> I just want to take Adelaide home.<eos> Reach for your gun slowly.<eos> And slide it over to me.
Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, because clearly, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> First, I am not a snitch.<eos> Second, if you have this special connection, did you ever consider that maybe the Warehouse is trying to get your attention?<eos> And maybe zapping you is its way of asking you for help.<eos> You really think that's it?<eos> How the hell do I know?<eos> But if you want to be the caretaker so badly, go care-take!<eos> All right!<eos> You wanted my attention?<eos> You got it.
Watch your head.<eos> Hey, what are you doing with my C.I.?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Narcotics.<eos> Little out of your district, aren't you?<eos> He was gathering information for me on a case.<eos> Are you all right? Yeah, I could be better.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were a C.I.?<eos> Why would he tell you?<eos> All right, give me your badge. I'll run it through.
I'm not usually so...<eos> Do I get to run with that one?<eos> I'm-I'm not easy.<eos> You can ask... any of my ex-boyfriends.<eos> My chief, my partner, my sister, my dad, my...<eos> Oh, no, I'll let you take that one.<eos> Let's talk about why you've been spotted nosing around a case that you're not approved to investigate.<eos> Lot of eyes around the precinct.<eos> So, you take comfort in your work.<eos> You're good at it.
I know that I'm sired to you, Damon.<eos> You know what would make me happy?<eos> That what you actually felt for me was real.<eos> How together are they?<eos> But there's hope now.<eos> Tell him what the hunter told you the tattoo leads to.<eos> He said there was a cure.<eos> And we're not the only ones who want it...<eos> I want to ram it down Niklaus' throat.<eos> But uncovering it comes with a price.
He said there was a cure.<eos> And we're not the only ones who want it...<eos> I want to ram it down Niklaus' throat.<eos> But uncovering it comes with a price.<eos> What do you know about Silas?<eos> He's the world's first immortal being, who just happens to be imprisoned with the cure.<eos> You said it yourself, right?<eos> Whoever finds the cure first gets to decide what to do with it.<eos> So what do you say, partners?<eos> The race for the cure has begun, but how far will we have to go to find it?
So now I can't even meditate right?<eos> What else can I fail?<eos> Bonnie, you didn't fail.<eos> I did an expression spell that almost killed April.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Almost.<eos> Failing would have been actually killing her.<eos> You got, like, a d-minus.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> I have all this power now, and I'm worried I won't be able to control it.
A bit ironic you coming to me for help.<eos> Weren't your friends just trying to bury me in a cement tomb?<eos> This is your fault.<eos> You started this when you forced Jeremy to kill those vampires.<eos> And my little brat of a brother has gone and made things worse.<eos> Well, he never did like Damon.<eos> I suppose I should do something, shouldn't I?<eos> Call him off, Klaus.<eos> You are in no position to make demands, love.<eos> Whilst I'd like to cure you to make more hybrids, I do have other reasons for finding the cure, not the least of which is destroying it so you lot can't use it against me.
I'm not playing on anything.<eos> This is the truth.<eos> You told me what happened.<eos> Your reckless use of magic is the reason... don't.<eos> Is the reason those spirits are torturing her on the other side.<eos> Hurting her again and again and again.<eos> I said don't!<eos> Unh! My hand!<eos> You can't stop, can you?<eos> All this power that you're feeling, you actually like it, don't you?
Ream her little triangle<eos> Tweak her dewy rosebud<eos> Huh, valerie? Tweaking the rosebud?<eos> I just adore macho ribaIdry!<eos> With you, France is in good hands.<eos> Try harder, and you may reach puberty!<eos> Don't be miffed at me.<eos> If it's because we disagreed on that speech...<eos> You can do better. I showed it to you:<eos> you said it was perfect.
It's the Minister.<eos> New York's in 2 days.<eos> You realize?<eos> We'd cut that in the old version.<eos> Why's it back?<eos> But the new one's already old.<eos> The new-new one, has bits from the oId-oId one.<eos> Look, I did a summary of part 2. On UN inspectors.<eos> The old first one?<eos> Weren't you rewriting it?
Watch out for gene food.<eos> They say everything modified these days, Celal.<eos> It scares me. We've been talking about this for days, even at the baths.<eos> We have to think about gene food everywhere we go these days.<eos> Celal, your relationship with Ceren is the best thing you've done.<eos> You're no good at work.<eos> You don't have any skills.<eos> You don't play any instruments...<eos> What happened to that violin I got you?<eos> You threw it out, didn't you?
So, wait-- so you've done this before.<eos> - Well, I've seen it done before.<eos> - Okay, you said--<eos> Okay, at least knock me out with something first.<eos> I think the adrenaline from the fear has to work with the poison.<eos> I just- - I think that's how it is.<eos> Finished.<eos> Somebody's coming.<eos> Close the door, close the door.<eos> Make sure it's locked.
Why are you calling?<eos> I just came across an old client of mine,<eos> Véra Musil.<eos> - Did you sleep with her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You bastard!<eos> Was it good?<eos> - Listen...<eos> - She hasn't got your number.<eos> I wanted to check, before giving it to her.
Martin, wait.<eos> Will you see her again?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Things aren't easy between her husband and her.<eos> You might get lucky.<eos> How did she connect the dots between you and me?<eos> Maybe she saw your photo at mine.<eos> I didn't think she would jump all over you.<eos> Right, Martin, I'm exhausted.<eos> Come and see the shop, you're going to pay for it.
- No.<eos> This is where I woke up 2 days ago.<eos> - Did you sleep with this woman?<eos> - No.<eos> No?<eos> That's good at least.<eos> Who did you sleep with then?<eos> A woman I met on a night out.<eos> - I was sure it was her flat.<eos> - Maybe she borrowed it.
Don't worry.<eos> Ok.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Bye dad.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - Kisses.<eos> - Shit, it wasn't her.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Nothing proves that your gun killed Véronique Parant.<eos> - Did you put it elsewhere?
I don't know what they could possibly--<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> It's Harris.<eos> - They're disposing of the body.<eos> - Body? What body?<eos> Detective, you can't let them leave the hotel.<eos> The recording, where is it?<eos> I don't know of any recording.<eos> The one of Sanja, your old neighbor, it wasn't in his room or on his computer.<eos> I swear, I don't have it.
Finch, now would be a good time to tender your resignation.<eos> Have you ever lied to people you work with?<eos> No.<eos> Have you ever knowingly associated with a wanted criminal?<eos> No.<eos> Have you--<eos> What was that about?<eos> How would you describe your relationship with Narcotics Detective Cal Beecher?<eos> Cal?<eos> You describe it as... platonic?
But each guy I nab, I get 10%.<eos> With a console or a Smartphone, it's not bad.<eos> And when you catch an elderly stealing food?<eos> It's my job.<eos> If everybody stole it would be anarchy.<eos> Look, a client takes a game for their console.<eos> He does the rest of his shopping and on the sly, he puts the packaging in a shelf.<eos> Then he hides the game in a pack of milk.<eos> The client as an accomplice in the shop.<eos> A stockman. The stockman takes the milk throws it in the skip with other items. And before his shift is over, he takes the game.
Make it part of our deal.<eos> You are a spicy one, aren't ya? Oh, well.<eos> Rumplestiltskin.<eos> What? My name.<eos> I do believe you just earned it.<eos> Now... let's begin.<eos> Emma, did you find it? Yeah. There's nothing in it.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Invisible chalk.<eos> Use it in the front doorway. Draw a line.
- Hope you like the cure.<eos> - Funny.<eos> So is everything about the eighties so... excessive?<eos> It had its charm. "Say anything"--<eos> Lloyd Dobler standing outside of a bedroom window with a boombox over his head desperately trying to get back the girl of his dreams. "Princess bride"--<eos> Wesley slays giant rats for love.<eos> "Breakfast club"-- one detention turns a bunch of outcasts into allies.<eos> So it was a decade of sentimental drivel, as well.<eos> Well, I was gonna say love, friendship, Possibility of anything happening.<eos> You would've loved it.
Those dolly-mops I ensnared last night-- their performance was quite invigorating.<eos> I've got a bit to work out.<eos> Are you Krebs?<eos> Yes.<eos> Delivery for you.<eos> Mr. Ennis, welcome to Saint Gerard's.<eos> Is my sister here yet?<eos> She is, but per the agreement your attorney made with the state, you won't be allowed to see her while you're here.<eos> Once you're inside, we'll prep you for surgery.<eos> We'll remove one kidney, and then transplant it into your sister.
- Cooper? He's been shooting pornography here.<eos> Hi.<eos> I take it your meeting did not go well. You haven't asked why I'm lying on the table.<eos> You are clearly distracted.<eos> My subletter filmed a pornographic movie in my apartment, so now I'm getting evicted.<eos> Well, I suppose now you can do as I suggested:<eos> live as a wandering nomad of sobriety.<eos> I don't want to be a wandering nomad of sobriety.<eos> I want my own space.<eos> Well, perhaps I could help you reclaim it. No.
keep it with you.<eos> I went to her place as soon as I touched down.<eos> This is the cell phone.<eos> Looked like there'd been a bit of a struggle.<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, but do you have $2.2 million?<eos> In May of 2011, Rhys stole exactly that amount from his Dominican suppliers.<eos> He's been hiding out in Thailand ever since.<eos> Like I said, ex-dealer.<eos> They got sloppy with some transactions.<eos> I saw an opportunity for early retirement, and took it.
- Boss!<eos> - Boss!<eos> Who was it, was it that fucker jung?<eos> I wonder, who could it be?<eos> - Boss, no!<eos> - Sir!<eos> Call a meeting.<eos> Okay, and I'll book the flight back.<eos> Is the file on chief kang not ready yet?<eos> I made sure to have it for you when we arrive.
He retired in 1982 and lives abroad.<eos> The fingerprints belongs to Marja Ruotsalainen, a criminal addict.<eos> Marja Ruotsalainen, you said?<eos> Alive, on disability, lives in Tyresö.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Are both of you going?<eos> 4711. That's a german eau de cologne.<eos> And the number Waltin used on the fake document to Wijnbladh.<eos> Recite the description.<eos> - It's short.
And we start going down.<eos> And i'm fighting to keep it level, and it ain't no use.<eos> And i always wake up just before impact, sweating.<eos> While i believe i understand your subtle metaphor, what i don't understand is why you feel the need to tell me.<eos> Well...<eos> I'm telling you so you understand...<eos> Why i'm about to do what i'm about to do.<eos> Ellstin, we had a deal.<eos> We did. Yeah.<eos> And now i'm changing it.
Okay.<eos> Did you move my lockbox?<eos> No.<eos> Did you tell the boys where it was?<eos> Of course not.<eos> My gun's gone.<eos> Maybe you forgot where you put it, Detective.<eos> It's an honest mistake.<eos> I did not misplace my gun, okay?<eos> Somebody must have taken it, w which means whoever's setting me up was in this house.
What the hell happened here?<eos> They shot Tara.<eos> She's not healing.<eos> That fucking governor.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> What did this to her?<eos> The police have these new fucking guns.<eos> The bullet, it's still inside her.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm getting it out, Pam.
Appreciate your cooperation.<eos> Sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'm happy to.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just have to get into the patient file.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - What?<eos> This keeps happening to me.<eos> I try to go into the patient file and I guess I deleted it.
I just want to protect him.<eos> Are you sure this is about protecting Henry, and not yourself?<eos> Why are you so nervous?<eos> When I found my mom, I was excited.<eos> Because I have the benefit of a little more life experience.<eos> I know that things don't always happen the way we want them to.<eos> Sure, but in my book, it says that you could see the future.<eos> Why can't you just look and see what's gonna happen?<eos> Well, that ability is complicated.<eos> I didn't always have it.
No, thanks.<eos> One minute.<eos> Bae, please.<eos> Give me a chance.<eos> You once loved me.<eos> You were once a good man.<eos> I can be that man again.<eos> I've changed.<eos> Look, I came here to this city without magic.<eos> Yeah, yeah, and you're still trying to use it to make up for your mistakes.
I'm sure it was nothing. - Snow...<eos> No, no, please.<eos> Please, just stay here.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> And you're sure this is where we're supposed to dig? Yes.<eos> Hook marked it clearly.<eos> Rumplestiltskin's dagger is here.<eos> Unless Hook lied to us.<eos> Well, then this map is useless.<eos> Gold is the only one who can translate it. Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.
She doesn't trust her mother. Never has.<eos> If we can put some doubt in her about Cora's motives, it might slow them down.<eos> And you think she'll just trust you?<eos> Well, she doesn't need to trust me.<eos> She just has to listen to me.<eos> And I know how to get her to do that.<eos> So, uh... - You like pizza?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> L-let me guess.<eos> You're gonna tell me the best pizza's in New York and I gotta try it, right?
Come over here.<eos> I think I can help you with that.<eos> Thanks, Earl, but you don't have a small business.<eos> The size of my business has never been in question.<eos> And I may not have a business, but...<eos> Han Lee does.<eos> Max, look.<eos> Earl forged Han's signature.<eos> That's what his signature looks like.<eos> When I forge it, I just draw a picture of Hello Kitty.
Why not?<eos> Because what if they check the trunk?<eos> Well, why would they?<eos> Because that's exactly their job.<eos> Yeah, on the Mexican border.<eos> Who the hell's gonna sneak in from Canada?<eos> Hm. Arctic wolves?<eos> And even if you had a passport what if they checked you for a gun?<eos> You do have a gun, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I-- Yeah, so maybe keep it handy.
Down here.<eos> He was in here. Why would an 11-year-old kid run away to the mines?<eos> Wouldn't be the first time.<eos> I think I know what he was looking for.<eos> The dynamite the dwarfs use for blasting.<eos> What the hell would he want dynamite for?<eos> To get rid of magic.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> At the diner, he said someone should get rid of magic.<eos> What, so he's gonna blow it up?
Hey!<eos> Regina! Get away from my son!<eos> He's not yours, he's mine.<eos> And after I cast this, you'll never see him again.<eos> That's never gonna happen.<eos> If you wanna kill Mary Margaret, you're gonna have to go through us.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Stop! - Henry, get out of the way!<eos> Not until someone helps me destroy magic!<eos> There's no way to get rid of it.
It's her.<eos> It's not just her, it's everyone!<eos> Look what magic did to Mary Margaret.<eos> Look at what it did to you!<eos> It's ruining everything.<eos> It makes good people do terrible things.<eos> And bad people.<eos> Please.<eos> It's gonna destroy my family.<eos> Help me get rid of it.
And instead, ask yourself the more important question.<eos> My cancer was a death sentence, remember?<eos> Yet, here I am.<eos> The Dragon.<eos> The liquid in the bottle, it worked.<eos> It cured me, August.<eos> And it can cure you, too.<eos> I still have some of it left.<eos> The bottle's in my apartment in New York.<eos> You can go get it.
Do not forget to take it when you leave.<eos> I'm not going anywhere until I get the truth.<eos> Interesting choice of words from someone who lied about being sick.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't have cancer.<eos> And yet you sought me out.<eos> I've been searching for someone like you for a very long time.<eos> For magic.<eos> It's rare in this world.<eos> So rare most would say it's fiction.
You're right.<eos> I don't have cancer.<eos> And yet you sought me out.<eos> I've been searching for someone like you for a very long time.<eos> For magic.<eos> It's rare in this world.<eos> So rare most would say it's fiction.<eos> But not you.<eos> Not me.<eos> But finding it, that has not been easy.
So I'm a fraud, too.<eos> No.<eos> Literally nothing.<eos> The liquid in this bottle doesn't contain a single element found in this world.<eos> Can you explain that?<eos> What I create is not from this world, because the people who need my help suffer from afflictions that science cannot treat.<eos> People like the man you stole that from.<eos> I didn't steal anything.<eos> I paid for what's in this bottle.<eos> But now that I have it,
You know, she's not exactly cooperative.<eos> But that's all about to change.<eos> Right, Regina?<eos> (WHIRRING AND CRACKLING STOPS) (WEAKLY) You have no idea who you're dealing with.<eos> Actually, no, you have no idea who you are dealing with.<eos> A couple of fools in over their heads who go around stealing magic?<eos> Stealing magic? (CHUCKLES)<eos> That's what you think we're here to do?<eos> We're not here to steal magic.<eos> We're here to destroy it.
I'll track them down in hell if I have to.<eos> The last bean.<eos> Henry! Henry!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> We have to follow them! There has to be a way.<eos> Not only do we not know where they went, - but Hook stole the last bean.<eos> - I don't care!<eos> - Without it, there's no way to follow.
She tirelessly devoted herself to helping those less fortunate in the glades.<eos> I like to think that if the men who murdered her knew her;<eos> knew the work that she did, knew the person that she was...<eos> He would have helped her to her car, made sure she was safe, instead of stealing her purse and shooting her.<eos> The truth is, I haven't done enough for this city.<eos> My city.<eos> I failed it.<eos> But I promise you-- I am not finished yet.<eos> I promise you that this city will be better for all of us.<eos> And on that day, I will look at this beautiful award and feel that I have earned it.
You're right, it's just narcissistic junk.<eos> Even if I had cleaned the lens, I couldn't have.<eos> Now, it's your vision that you'll have to clean.<eos> And if it's ruined I can't do it.<eos> It could be that he didn't find it interesting.<eos> Or you didn't find yourself interesting.<eos> Why did I spend my whole childhood running after my father?<eos> What happened to me?<eos> Aren't we exaggerating a bit with this camera?<eos> I don't know if it's worth fixing.
Let me see.<eos> I said it was fine.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> It hap... it happens sometimes, Philip.<eos> Can I just...<eos> I'm gonna deal with it.<eos> You're gonna deal with it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If I'd wanted to deal with him, you don't think he'd be dealt with?<eos> I wanted the intel, and I got it.
Philip, stop.<eos> You are not my daddy.<eos> No, I'm not your daddy.<eos> I'm your husband, Elizabeth.<eos> What do you think husbands do?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Henry, where's your thermos?<eos> It's in the lunchbox, isn't it?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I might have left it in the lunch room, then.
I may have a solution.<eos> Gemma, Oscar, this is Felix.<eos> Hello!<eos> Brilliant.<eos> So I'm going out for a couple of hours, so you be good or mommy's going to be very upset, okay?<eos> Same goes for you.<eos> So, what now?<eos> Does your daddy have a drinks trolley? What's that?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll find it.
Donnie, Donnie...<eos> You're right.<eos> Everyone deserves their privacy.<eos> Come.<eos> - I thought you handed in your sidearm.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Left jacket pocket, hanging low.<eos> Well, apparently I've got a stalker.<eos> Sit.<eos> Put it on the table.
And this is the differentiated portion. Yes, this is an encrypted I.D. tag.<eos> It's how they tell you apart.<eos> Okay. But how to decode it?<eos> I have four nucleotides to work with...<eos> G, C, T, and A...<eos> And no idea how they're encrypted.<eos> I mean, there's thousands of permutations and we're running out of time.<eos> Yes, but I know your tag number.<eos> You do?<eos> Yes, I saw it many times. It's numeric, so, if we know how that translates, then we can figure out the rest.
He in on it?<eos> No.<eos> They must've thought he was, but it was my deal.<eos> That's the story.<eos> Mother Teresa's given name, five letters, ending in...<eos> Agnes.<eos> A-G-N-E-S.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it?
Don't get in her way, Cal!<eos> She's got an angry, red vagina and she's been drinking rum punch since 1 0:00 a.m.<eos> Thank God we pumped.<eos> I cannot believe you brought Maury Kind.<eos> Yeah, I'm mixing sound on Urban Tales.<eos> He's going through a divorce, so I invited him.<eos> -I didn't know you'd geek out so hard.<eos> -You know, I'd love to talk to him.<eos> Well, it'd be weird if you didn't.<eos> Besides, he read your "Modern Love" column and loved it.
Well, I was getting ready to practice our wedding dance, but then Wanda postponed the wedding.<eos> Said it was doctor's orders.<eos> So, thank you, Doctor.<eos> Um, I should probably... Yeah.<eos> Go deal with this.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Wade, I'm so glad you're back.<eos> Dr. Hart?<eos> Oh, hey, Wanda. Thanks for coming back to see me.<eos> Earlier, when I implied that planning a wedding might be stressful, I didn't mean for you to postpone it.
- What golden coin, Murvet?<eos> - What would you do without me?<eos> What a futile act!<eos> Come and dance, mother-in-law.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I don't like to dance.<eos> Dancing was the only thing left undone.<eos> I have a headache again.<eos> Give me my medicine, Murvet.<eos> - I don't have it.
The uniform still fits.<eos> You look fantastic.<eos> We are totally gonna kick grove hill's ass.<eos> Should be fun.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You guys, I left my makeup back on the bus.<eos> The competition's bigger than last year. I'm gonna go stretch.<eos> I like your ribbon.<eos> Um, thanks.<eos> I want it.

I'm gonna go stretch.<eos> I like your ribbon.<eos> Um, thanks.<eos> I want it.<eos> Yeah, but I'm using it, so go get your own.
Again, a regrettable decision, but a necessary one.<eos> No one life is above the safety of millions of Americans.<eos> That's the ugly math that I have to deal with every day.<eos> You of all people should understand that.<eos> I do.<eos> And if I were in your place, I'd do the exact same thing.<eos> I may not be in the program anymore, but I-- I still understand how important it is.<eos> Then why the cloak and dagger?<eos> Cole's research on the Aquino case.<eos> I wanted to give it to you personally.
Trying to get his location.<eos> What about his friends and family?<eos> We did find an IP address in the database here.<eos> Came from a house in Maryland.<eos> Property records indicate that it's owned by a Gloria and Ronald Fowler.<eos> Yeah, and?<eos> Bryan Fowler. Their son, is a member of Freedom 13.<eos> We need to talk to him.<eos> No phone, but I do have an address.<eos> - Who wants it? - Yeah.
We are... so alike, Ryan.<eos> It is through death that we both live.<eos> I got worried.<eos> You've been down here a long time.<eos> Yes. I'd been wondering when you'd work that one out.<eos> Somebody killed Vince.<eos> Here's how we're gonna do this.<eos> If Ryan so much as moves a hair, put a bullet through the pretty lady's head.<eos> I think you should put your gun down.<eos> Now kick it to me.
Stop lying!<eos> I'm not lying...<eos> But if you help me, I will take you the rest of the way, I promise.<eos> Did you know this whole time that there was only one cure?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> How could I?<eos> I've never seen it.<eos> Look, everything I ever said and did was just to bring back my family, I swear.<eos> Well, then you know what it's like to have hope, and now you know what it feels like to lose it.
And now, passing the Peace, keep it in mind you might not see it immediately, yet think about it as this spot of God is in each of us.<eos> It makes us all equal.<eos> In each of us, there is this spark of holiness.<eos> Give something under her head.<eos> What are you afraid of?<eos> Give something under her head.<eos> - What is your name?<eos> - Roksana.<eos> You won't get the paper without confession.<eos> But Father! The previous priest used to give it.
This is it.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's inside the tree.<eos> Just for some honey, she's risking her life.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Well, I think I just couldn't stop smiling' for several days after filming.<eos> The relief was just unbelievable.<eos> Back at the camera platform, James has had a long night.<eos> For over four hours, the elephant tried to shake him out of the tree.<eos> Got down this morning when the Bayaka came to collect me, went to look at the camera, and he'd pulled it out of the tree, and he'd chewed through the power cable.
Tough though they are, such refugees living on the edges of North Africa cannot survive in the heart of the Sahara.<eos> And yet here, in southern Nigeria, there are creatures preparing to journey right across the centre of that great desert.<eos> Barn swallows.<eos> They spent the winter roosting in a forest of elephant grass.<eos> But now, it's time for them to leave.<eos> All two million of them.<eos> They're tiny, each weighing the same as a couple of one pound coins, yet the journey to their breeding grounds in Europe is over 3,000 miles long.<eos> Ahead of them lies a vast death trap.<eos> The Sahara is too large to go around.<eos> The swallows have no choice but to meet it head-on.
This is the White Desert, in Egypt.<eos> The landscape is littered with giant chalk pillars, carved by innumerable sandstorms.<eos> This glaring white oven is lethally hot.<eos> Food here is almost non-existent.<eos> But there's a rare gift from a passing camel.<eos> The smell has lured dung beetles from miles around.<eos> For them, this is manna from heaven.<eos> One dung ball could provide enough food to last this female beetle the rest of her life.<eos> But she has a problem.<eos> To keep it fresh, she must bury it in moist ground.
I'm on-site.<eos> Wait for backup, detective.<eos> That's an order.<eos> You won't shoot me.<eos> - You're not a murderer, remember?<eos> - But you are.<eos> And if I let you go, that blood will be on my hands.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I practiced that move.<eos> I had a feeling I might need it someday.
Now you're a friend?<eos> The same friend who threatened to blast me from here to Tokyo?<eos> I guess our job is done.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> How can you drink this coffee?<eos> It's like sludge.<eos> It's military issue.<eos> Drinking it at night in the jungle used to calm me down.<eos> Actually this place kind of reminds me of a jungle.<eos> Here's the file. I found it.
Even if it was just a prank, some things cannot be forgiven!<eos> Rapid power decrease.<eos> System error detected.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Synthetic alloys and unknown biological entities have invaded the system.<eos> Technovores.<eos> Power source and all sensors have been compromised.<eos> Technovores?<eos> This armor is pretty well made.<eos> Who do you think made it?
That is the providence of nature.<eos> A superior technology to that of man.<eos> Howard will be the whistling arrow that announces the new reality.<eos> You should be honored.<eos> The wind that follows is going to blow away your most advanced technology.<eos> Howard will be the shot that leads the way.<eos> Hey.<eos> Obadiah was lucky he didn't hang around long enough to see this.<eos> New technology, you say?<eos> Technovores, you called it?
It was me.<eos> I was a stalker. It was back in Canada.<eos> I liked a guy and he didn't like me, and... well, I got a little obsessed.<eos> I'd fill up my journals all about him, and eventually there may have been a teensy-weensy 50-meter restraining order.<eos> 50 meters?<eos> That's like... four years.<eos> Wow. You must have been a total nutbag.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> Ted is right, there is a fine line.<eos> Anyone can cross it and get obsessed.
Understood.<eos> Good.<eos> What do we do when the people start asking about the propane?<eos> Well, that has nothing to do with this.<eos> Oh, I know that, but some people might find it hard to swallow that we just happened to be stockpiling fuel right before a disaster.<eos> So, should we tell them the truth? That's your business.<eos> I have no idea what the hell you wanted with all that crap.<eos> Please.<eos> You were more than happy to turn a blind eye, but... you're not dumb.<eos> I did what I had to do to keep this town from going broke, to keep it safe.
And how, exactly, are they going to learn that?<eos> One of the three people in this room is gonna tell them.<eos> I'm guessing it won't be you.<eos> I'm afraid it won't be one of you either.<eos> You gonna kill us?<eos> Oh, I won't need to.<eos> You're bound by the confidentiality agreement Jessica signed the night I left.<eos> "All knowledge of any activity of Daniel Hardman--"<eos> I know what it goddamn says.<eos> You signed it so quickly, I wasn't sure.
Okay, fine.<eos> Then what we need to do next is dig into Monica Eton.<eos> I think--<eos> Hold on.<eos> You're on Folsom Foods, not Monica Eton.<eos> Harvey, they're using the exact lawsuit I wrote, word for word.<eos> I know how to fight it.<eos> Did he tell you that?<eos> No, he didn't need to.<eos> I read it.
Glad you got my message.<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I reached out.<eos> Some of my old people, they like their toys.<eos> You know how to tune up an MP5, these boys know you.<eos> Man, what did I say?<eos> Hold up, hold up.<eos> I got a name.<eos> Tico Bettis.<eos> Out of Bed-Stuy.<eos> If he's the one who tweaked that gun, he might know who used it.
You were uncomfortable with the lie that we've told.<eos> You shouldn't be.<eos> Easy for you to say. Why?<eos> Because I'm a mere consultant and you're a real policeman, huh?<eos> You think I don't have as much respect for the captain as you do?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I removed the gun from your apartment for two reasons.<eos> Firstly, I'm absolutely certain that you didn't shoot Curtis Bradshaw.<eos> Why?<eos> Because only an idiot would've brought the gun back to his apartment after he'd used it.
I talked to the hotel in Nantucket, and they said Jack and Amanda haven't checked in.<eos> Hey, what about Jack and Amanda? Uh...<eos> Oh, I was... just telling Emily that, uh, I talked to the hotel, and our newlyweds are firmly ensconced in their honeymoon suite with a "Do not disturb" sign on the door.<eos> - That's a relief. - Thank you, Nolan.<eos> Um, you don't know how to fix an air conditioner, do you?<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't know why I ask you.<eos> We need to find Nate.<eos> Do you have his cell phone number?<eos> We can trace it. I'll get it from Jack's cloud.
Greasy.<eos> It's not butter. It's cheap.<eos> It has no smell.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Keep going.<eos> People hate it.<eos> Hold on a second. Who hates margarine?<eos> You said there were no wrong answers.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - I don't hate it.
But it got dirty.<eos> Oh, that one.<eos> She's got it.<eos> She's got a subscription.<eos> Okay.<eos> - You're really good!<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I got you a horse magazine.<eos> I didn't know you had it.<eos> I lent it to a friend before I had time to read it.
Elizabeth was worried about you --<eos> Until she realized that forcing you to keep a secret from me wasn't gonna make the situation any safer.<eos> How long have you known?<eos> Since the accident.<eos> I actually thought I was ahead of you this time.<eos> Getting that evidence isn't only about vindicating your father.<eos> It's about bringing Pratt to justice.<eos> He forced Hughes out of the FBI to keep that box hidden.<eos> I want to see what's inside it.<eos> And we're gonna find it.
Earth is trying to revive itself.<eos> It's not over yet.<eos> It may just be the new beginning that you wanted.<eos> Even if we all perish, this flower, the world that gave us life, will continue its fight to be reborn.<eos> Even the human race might...<eos> Each spark is a link... in the eternal cycle.<eos> This is...my freedom!<eos> Old friend...<eos> It's no good, the dark matter's out of control.<eos> We can't keep it suppressed!
- This is gonna be rough.<eos> Because he ran out of Monet.<eos> You're gonna get that on the walk home.<eos> How about this one?<eos> You know what, we'd... we'd love to hear it, but we've got that, um... that...<eos> Steely Dan, Carnegie Hall, backstage pass. Let's go.<eos> We don't want to miss whatever their big song was.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your wedding response card, as promised.<eos> Why didn't you just mail it like everybody else?

Is everything okay?<eos> Terrific.<eos> Couldn't be better.<eos> Oh, bite me.<eos> Look, we can still have a nice night.<eos> Just tell me where it is.<eos> Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I'd tell you.<eos> Uh, where what is?<eos> She hid my Xbox like I'm a child.<eos> Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don't give it back, I'm telling.
Were you the one who always cried and burned<eos> I couldn't laugh either in this world oflies<eos> Did you think I was happy<eos> In a world that stole my life over nothing<eos> Did you think I was happy<eos> In a world that stole my life over nothing<eos> Oh in this world oflies world oflies<eos> In this world that fakes a smile to your face<eos> You cried dear and I burned<eos> I thought the world would be how I wished it
Police.<eos> Everybody stay seated, be calm.<eos> Stand back!<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Just take it easy, all right?<eos> Why don't you put that gun down, Darryl, okay?<eos> You put your gun down first!<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> - Go.<eos> I swear, I'll use it.
you're staying on the sidelines on this one.<eos> Gabe Lowan.<eos> Mr. Lowan, it's Catherine Chandler.<eos> What can I do for you, Detective?<eos> I have a possible location for our killer.<eos> You do?<eos> You said, "by any means necessary,"<eos> so, I went outside the box.<eos> Went to Rikers, tough-talked a few of my old collars who used to be my eyes and ears on the street.<eos> Turns out, one of them had an address, so I'm texting it to you right now.
Okay, just let me explain.<eos> Okay.<eos> Alex...<eos> Alex, put the gun down.<eos> What you saw, that isn't who he is.<eos> He's the same guy you've always known.<eos> No.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> Come on, Alex, put it down.
Somebody noticed all the medication Alex has been stealing for the clinic.<eos> My prints...<eos> Catherine got rid of any trace. Oh, man.<eos> I am such an ass.<eos> Can't say I'm going to argue with you there.<eos> Ah, get it, I got to go.<eos> Didn't expect to hear from you.<eos> I didn't expect to call, but I found a bug in my office.<eos> I'm assuming not a cockroach?<eos> I ran it for prints;
Cray-cray gotta go bye-bye before you get stab-stabbed.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> And are you guys saying this because you don't want me to be with Jeanette, or because you want me to stay single so you guys can keep your clubhouse?<eos> J'accuse!<eos> I had a point, and they knew it.<eos> You see, in early 2013, I was the only single guy in the group.<eos> Which meant whenever Marshall or Barney bought something they weren't allowed to keep in their apartments...<eos> You know what, Ted?<eos> That reminds me.<eos> I just bought this antique Swiss clock, but Robin won't let us put it in the apartment, so I was gonna leave it at your place.

Need a medic.<eos> Relax, you'll be okay.<eos> Four of our spied died up here.<eos> Miles, what do we do?<eos> What is it?<eos> Monroe set a nuke to Atlanta.<eos> Two-man strike team smuggled across the border.<eos> When?<eos> A day ago, maybe two.<eos> You think Monroe's crazy enough to use it?

Nope.<eos> But the man who did, he's your problem.<eos> He's a hell of a problem.<eos> Little mash note from Sebastian.<eos> "Dear citizens, our fight is not with you.<eos> It is with your leaders who insist upon war. "<eos> If the Georgia federation does not offer an unconditional surrender by midnight tonight, he's going to detonate a nuke.<eos> You must have heard he got power.<eos> But a nuclear bomb?<eos> And he's deranged enough to use it.
I've broken down the rifles used in the simulation.<eos> Barrels measure out at seven millimeters.<eos> Even if you modify the firing mechanism, there's no way one these could have discharged a nine-mil round.<eos> Okay, so that means somebody had to have a real gun.<eos> Wouldn't be hard to pull off.<eos> Participants don't get searched coming in, and the simulation guns look so authentic, it's hard to tell them apart from the real thing.<eos> Steve.<eos> Duke, what do you got?<eos> Handgun, nine-millimeter.<eos> My guys found it ditched in some scrub less than 50 yards from the murder scene.
Jason!<eos> - Help!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Jason.<eos> Jason.<eos> Evenin', vampire Bill.<eos> Sheriff Bellefleur.<eos> I hate doing this, especially 'cause you're kin, but the thing is, there's a curfew enforced for your kind.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm truly sorry to be breaking it.
Do I have to kill her?<eos> She does know the location of the crypts. But working with a demon is unclean.<eos> Well, we could use her as Crowley did.<eos> Agreed.<eos> - Finding that Angel Tablet.<eos> SAM:<eos> Wait a second. Did you just say "Angel Tablet"?<eos> You know, I get why Crowley calls you Moose now.<eos> Yes, Angel Tablet.<eos> Crowley found out Lucifer had it, figures it's stashed in a crypt.
Finding the other half of the Demon Tablet, that is priority, isn't it?<eos> I can't let you take that, Dean.<eos> Can't or won't?<eos> Both.<eos> How did you get out of purgatory, Cass?<eos> There has to be another way.<eos> You have done this a thousand times, Castiel.<eos> You're ready.<eos> Kill him.<eos> Then take the tablet and bring it home where it belongs.
Yes.<eos> I think I've just done something on my own initiative.<eos> You did?<eos> I found the mobile number for the council guy who signs off the closures.<eos> - Cassidy?<eos> - Yeah, Cassidy.<eos> That's him.<eos> You found his number?<eos> Yeah, I have his mobile number.<eos> I knew you'd need it.

Who?<eos> I'm running the site at Claremount.<eos> We've some road closures agreed.<eos> - How did you get this number?<eos> - You gave it to me. You gave it to me in case anything came up over Christmas.<eos> - Yeah, well, it's not Christmas.<eos> - Yes, but I need a sign-off.<eos> - I'm in an Indian restaurant.<eos> - Yes, but I need a sign-off.<eos> - Seriously, I need it.
Gavin, you're a lawyer.<eos> You're used to making a case.<eos> So go ahead.<eos> I'm going to give you ten minutes to deliver the closing argument of your life.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm trying to get a lock on his wireless signal.<eos> 10 minutes to convince me not to blow you away.<eos> What did Malcolm want with you at the hospital?<eos> A target for reprisal.<eos> He wants justice, and he's not going to stop until he gets it.
After I rescued him from Purgatory, you mean, at the cost of many angels' lives.<eos> You screwed with his head and had him spy on us.<eos> Well, it is true that I have spoken with Castiel many times, trying to reach out to him, trying to help him.<eos> Dean, you must have noticed how Purgatory changed him.<eos> I mean, he's been unstable in the past, but I was shocked at how damaged he is now.<eos> Stop, okay?<eos> Don't -- don't try to spin this.<eos> You think I don't know that you told him to try and kill me?<eos> Yeah, I suppose that is how he would hear it.<eos> When I learned of the Angel tablet, I did tell Castiel to get it at any cost.
It's probably where the unsub learned about Kayla, from Tyler's posts.<eos> Which explains the switch in M.O.<eos> Tyler was fixated on strangulation.<eos> So, where's the unsub gonna get his material for his next kill?<eos> All the victims used different platforms.<eos> Writing seems to be the only common denominator.<eos> Guys, what if he created his own writing group?<eos> Dr. Houston's spoken all over the country.<eos> He could have attended a conference or read about his form of therapy.<eos> And adapted it to fit his needs.
So, um, this house is incredible, huh?<eos> I've never actually been inside. Yeah.<eos> Did you know there are all these tunnels and secret rooms where they used to have ritual animal sacrifices and sadomasochistic sex orgies with people writhing around naked, covered in goat blood?<eos> I wrote a dissertation about it. Oh.<eos> About witchcraft and occult practices in post-Revolutionary New York.<eos> Not about... goat orgies.<eos> Right, um...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, sounds cool.<eos> I'd love to read it sometime.
Hi.<eos> I just talked to the doctor.<eos> And our last try with IVF failed.<eos> And we don't have enough money for another round, so...<eos> The doctor said, at this point, it would take a miracle to get me pregnant.<eos> Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> Well, you studied witchcraft.<eos> Do you know any "get pregnant" spells?<eos> Honey, I studied history, not how-to, but if there were such a thing as real witchcraft, and I somehow had the ability to use it, you would be the first person I would help.
Mm-hmm.<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like our cop's stolen Glock.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> This is gonna be exhibit "A" at our trial.<eos> You know what, let's tear this place apart.<eos> We got to find that gun.<eos> You got to stop making these Holy Grail promises, Reagan.<eos> I mean, if you do find it, you look like a hero;
Sorry to bother you.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Let's go talk over here, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I heard you raided the perps' residence last night.<eos> A lot of evidence was recovered?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Unfortunately, we didn't find your gun.<eos> So they still have it?
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> He okay?<eos> He's hurting, but it'll ease up.<eos> Your brother's a stubborn bastard.<eos> He's a good guy, though.<eos> The best.<eos> Thanks for the cash.<eos> I can use it.
I'm gonna pay you back.<eos> For what?<eos> That nurse, the medicine.<eos> Christ, Ter, you want to pay me back?<eos> Call her.<eos> She likes you.<eos> Is there anger inside?<eos> Disappointment?<eos> Inhale deeply.<eos> Gather that anger, and when you exhale, just let it go.
Got another call.<eos> Yeah, Lena, what's up?<eos> Okay, Re-Kon's checked out.<eos> Your meet's set.<eos> I'll see you outside Ezra's party.<eos> Mom?<eos> Uh, there's a limo downstairs.<eos> A limo?<eos> With a driver.<eos> Daddy sent it for you.
But I can't.<eos> I can't, Mom.<eos> However long I am in this place, you have freed me.<eos> If I hug you, are they going to shoot us?<eos> I'm willing to risk it if you are.<eos> You can't win this.<eos> I now own 50 % of the stock.<eos> By tomorrow, I'll have the outstanding five percent and I will control your company.<eos> Any attempt to fight me will lead to litigation and leave you penniless.<eos> And trust me, poverty isn't as glamorous as Charles Dickens made it look.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> He's dead.<eos> No, no!<eos> I can't, I can't! I can help you.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> We're gonna lose her, Damon.<eos> She's ruthless without her humanity.<eos> The cure's the fastest way to get it back.
You want to be friends?<eos> Friendship--stage one.<eos> Show me that I can trust you.<eos> I saved your life... twice.<eos> Because you put it in danger... twice.<eos> Why can't you just do something decent for once?<eos> Because Tyler Lockwood tried to kill me.<eos> We've all tried to kill you.<eos> And you've tried to kill most of us.<eos> How do you think that you deserve my friendship when you've done nothing to earn it?
This is gonna be hilarious.<eos> When I was five, I dressed up my dad as Tinker Bell and we had a tea party and I recorded the whole thing.<eos> - Give me the Dreamcorder.<eos> - Run, Sam, hide it.<eos> I'll pay you 100 bucks if you show me later.<eos> 200 if you put it on YouTube.<eos> I don't care what she does with it.<eos> I looked damn good in the wings and the blue eye shadow.<eos> Okay, so why did you turn Kate down for the study?<eos> Because there's no grant unless we both do it.
Especially being thrown off balance by the giant fairy wings.<eos> So whenever you feel the urge to steal, remember to take a deep breath and realize that this is all just part of your compulsive disorder.<eos> It will pass.<eos> Now give me back my fountain pen.<eos> And my stapler.<eos> And my phone.<eos> By the way, you're very good.<eos> Oh, Charlie, what are you doing here?<eos> Waiting for you to realize she just stole your watch.<eos> She'll bring it back.
Hey, keep your hands where I can see them.<eos> You guys got it all wrong.<eos> There's no way I killed Dicey.<eos> Okay, well, enlighten us.<eos> I got an alibi.<eos> I was at the Blaisdell last night for the MMA fight.<eos> You got a ticket stub?<eos> Better-- they showed me on the Jumbotron.<eos> Come on, they got to have a record of that.<eos> And my credit card-- I used it to pick up my ticket at will call last night.
And that would've made the timing work out right.<eos> Max said she was injected six to eight hours before she fell.<eos> GHB is a very slow-acting drug.<eos> She would've gotten progressively more disoriented and unstable.<eos> Until she fell off her balcony.<eos> Come on, girls, come on!<eos> Skate hard!<eos> Coach, I want to go back in.<eos> No, I already told you, until you let me give you a shot for that arm, you're not going back in.<eos> I don't need it.
Thanks.<eos> I know a lot of people here knew her as Miss Moore.<eos> And I've really enjoyed hearing your stories about what a great teacher she was.<eos> But... I want you to know there was a lot more to her than that.<eos> I knew her as<eos> Dicey Hot star jammer for the Diamond Dolls.<eos> She was a... was a great friend and was one of the strongest people I've ever met.<eos> On and off the track.<eos> She was... she was so strong she stood up for me, even when I-I didn't ask for help.<eos> Even when I... when I didn't know I needed it.
Take care of this!<eos> -Yes, sir!<eos> -Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Run !<eos> You need to run. Sorry!<eos> Sorry!<eos> Close the door.<eos> Close it all the way!
Boats, boats, boats!<eos> Boats!<eos> What's this a commercial for again?<eos> I can't quite... Boats, boats, boats!<eos> Oh, get a room, you two.<eos> - You weren't there.<eos> - I was, too.<eos> All right, you were there?<eos> Tell me the story.<eos> I like the way you tell it.

Hold for Ted.<eos> Hello.<eos> Ted, I'm gonna ask you something, and I want you to be completely honest.<eos> What's your friend Robin's number?<eos> What?<eos> Ted, ask about the boat.<eos> Uh, Captain, can... can I put you on hold?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> He wants Robin's number.<eos> Should I give it to him?
The evidence on that laptop could send the Graysons away for lifetimes.<eos> The kind of punishment I came here for had nothing to do with prison.<eos> That computer was never part of the plan. It only clouded my judgment.<eos> So back to basics?<eos> No more distractions.<eos> Grace, can you come here?<eos> What time have you got?<eos> Uh, 7:40, why?<eos> This clock's running slow.<eos> You mind taking it to the shop?

- Yeah.<eos> - Had a problem with that in this club?<eos> - Not that I'm aware of.<eos> We don't allow drugs here, detective.<eos> Control your clientele.<eos> Before anyone else wanders into traffic.<eos> Any chance she could have scored the drugs in here? Doubt it.<eos> I tried not to hire too many drug dealers.<eos> Get me a list of employees.<eos> I'll have Felicity cross-reference it for drug arrests.
04... 25-30-78-12.<eos> Is it really bad? OK.<eos> Who's the surgeon?<eos> Doctor...<eos> I'll be there as fast as I can.<eos> It'll be ok, sweetie.<eos> I'll call you right back.<eos> Call me once you talk to the surgeon.<eos> Do you have my cell number?<eos> Write it down!
I saw you fall on your butt.<eos> Really?<eos> Hey! Lovebirds!<eos> Hurry up, Alison. You'll be late.<eos> She's really not stressed before a race.<eos> She started competing when she was 5.<eos> Sorry, Mom. We have to clean the bathroom and vacuum.<eos> - Where does the quilt go?<eos> - We pack it, it's mine.<eos> - What do I put it in?
You are the copy chief at one of the top 25 ad agencies in the country.<eos> You're not even 30. I'm jealous.<eos> I just bought an apartment.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Are we moving?<eos> We are, and we'd like you to write the press release.<eos> For what?<eos> We don't have a name yet, but make it sound like the agency you want to work for.<eos> Who do I give it to?<eos> Give it to Ted.
You're the one that can make the magic happen.<eos> Look, if you want me to turn the power back on I will help you, but not like this, not with Monroe.<eos> Who says I wanna turn the power on?<eos> Look what people did with it last time.<eos> Just killed each other.<eos> Like children playing with...<eos> Well, with electricity.<eos> The way to protect the many is to put the power in the hands of the few.<eos> - Like you and Monroe.<eos> - The blackout wiped the world clean. Burnt it down.
Yes, you are.<eos> Look,<eos> Jaelynn, um, there's this girl, and I didn't tell her that I was into her, and now she's with some dude with big arms.<eos> Um, are you, like, hitting on me?<eos> 'Cause you're, like, old.<eos> God.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, my-my p-point is, is that this-this kidney is a good thing, and that you need to take the good things when they're in front of you, because if you don't, someone else will.<eos> So you're saying, take this kidney so some dude with big arms doesn't get it?
- You can't...<eos> - That is it.<eos> Well, you heard the man.<eos> He's the boss.<eos> Now move.<eos> It's about time.<eos> You mean "Thank you, Meredith"<eos> "for carrying a kidney across state lines for me."<eos> Whatever.<eos> Hand it over.
Yes, I've noticed.<eos> Three days.<eos> No numbers.<eos> Maybe we're finally cleaning up the streets.<eos> As much as I'd like that, I have to wonder if it hasn't got something to do with the actually departed Kara Stanton.<eos> The virus that she uploaded during the time you spent in your bomb vest could easily have spread from the Department of Defense systems, all the way to the machine.<eos> You built the machine, Finch.<eos> Can't you access it?<eos> You know, check under the hood?<eos> I sealed it for a reason, Mr. Reese.
It turns out every victim of the killer moved cities within 18 months of vanishing.<eos> Rollins moved to New York.<eos> So I went to New York, found the rental bill. Followed him out here to Owen Island.<eos> Whoever was traveling as Rollins could easily still be on this island.<eos> Erica, we just lost the bridge.<eos> When did this happen, Stan?<eos> A few minutes ago.<eos> I locked up the bar, I saw Becky finishing the boards on the AP.<eos> We high-tailed it down to the bridge just in time to see it go under.<eos> No crossing it until the tides go down.
I can tell more about someone in the first 5 seconds than even their on parents can.<eos> ...To his sexist reason for hiring predominantly women.<eos> Women are hormonally optimal for working at this company.<eos> I like women.<eos> I can read women.<eos> Even better than I can read men.<eos> Women are malleable and I like malleable.<eos> But it was one part of the conversation that stood out over all the rest.<eos> Something that resonated with me in ways that I couldn't even begin to understand.<eos> I like employees who enjoy submitting to authority rather than challenging it.
I couldn't shut off my brain from thoughts of him.<eos> I craved his scent.<eos> His taste.<eos> His touch against my body.<eos> You never sleep this late.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What's that?<eos> Well ... I stayed up all night arguing with Greg about where we're gonna have our engagement party.<eos> He wants to have it at some sports bar!
To Joan.<eos> To Joan. And the baby.<eos> And the baby!<eos> Oh, sorry, guys, this is, um, one of the rehab facilities that, um, refers me to other clients.<eos> I should take it.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> This is Joan Watson.<eos> Joan, this is Dr. Caruso at Hemdale.<eos> I sent you a case file a little while ago. I was wondering if you had a chance to look at it?<eos> I'm just opening it right now.
Curious case, this one.<eos> Man approaches woman.<eos> Man gives woman flowers.<eos> And walks away, only to return moments later and push woman in front of train.<eos> It's pretty obvious the guy's a psychopath.<eos> Likely, yeah.<eos> Obvious, no.<eos> He takes great care to keep his face angled away from the platform security cameras.<eos> Speaks to premeditation.<eos> He'd been to the platform before and cased it.
Send him to me.<eos> I'll put him on my team.<eos> Really?<eos> Just like that?<eos> I love to give people breaks, especially if they can sing, but everybody thinks they can sing.<eos> - You got yourself a deal.<eos> - All right.<eos> Okay, one more favor I need from you.<eos> The girl I met on the way in, I want her number.<eos> I'm gonna do you an even bigger favor, I'm not gonna give it to you.
But that was 19 minutes and some serious acid reflux...<eos> "who orders spaghetti in an Irish bar?" ago.<eos> Now I'm 20-Seconds-From-Now Barney, and I'm telling you, watch that door.<eos> - Why?<eos> - That's why.<eos> Um, oh.<eos> In-In, like, 12 seconds.<eos> Your skin looks great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And thank you for taking such good care of it. Shh.
She was my foster mother, and Amanda's.<eos> Well, if this is the woman whose house Amanda burned down, what makes you think she would want to take part in a foundation bearing Amanda's name?<eos> Well, it's simple.<eos> Mrs. H. always taught us the power of forgiveness. But in recent years,<eos> Hayward House has fallen on hard times.<eos> So you think the A.C.F. should sponsor her home?<eos> Out of the ashes, a beacon of hope?<eos> And with Amanda's connection to Jack Porter, it's a win-win for your campaign... And the foundation.<eos> Well, then, since it's Mr. James' idea,<eos> I think he should run with it. Well, great.
Hey, are you listening to this?<eos> The advisory is for citizens.<eos> We are not citizens.<eos> We're detectives.<eos> So if they weren't the real target, what was, hmm?<eos> None of the other stores in the lobby were robbed.<eos> Must have gone upstairs.<eos> But the stairs were locked.<eos> The guard's elevator card was still in his jacket.<eos> You think they used it and then put it back?
Is something wrong with the machine, Finch?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who else are we missing?<eos> Just a matter of time now, Fusco.<eos> What do you say you lay down in this hole? I'll grab a shovel.<eos> Get up there.<eos> Detective Soriano.<eos> Time to face the truth, Fusco.<eos> Sir, the canine alerted right here, and the soil was loose.<eos> There was a body here, Detective, but-- Somebody moved it.
What the hell?<eos> !<eos> Take it easy, man.<eos> God!<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Take it --<eos> Found you on the floor, passed out.<eos> Your temperature was 107.<eos> I had to force it down or you were toast.
Hi, Cass.<eos> That's right, Cass.<eos> I got me an Angel on the payroll.<eos> It's that kind of universe these days.<eos> Now grab him and follow me.<eos> Hey, kid, you okay?<eos> I can't, all right?<eos> It's the break in the stone.<eos> There's key writing.<eos> I-I can't make it out.
So some blood went missing from a few hospitals.<eos> What about Elena?<eos> Don't vampires with their humanity off tend to overindulge in human blood,<eos> - or were you the exception?<eos> - It's not Elena. Well, let's say for a moment that it was Silas.<eos> I'm struggling to see how this affects me.<eos> Look.<eos> Silas wants to die and be reunited with his one true love, but he's supernatural, so if he takes the cure and dies, he gets stuck on the other side.<eos> How Shakespearian.<eos> But if he destroys the other side altogether, he can take the cure, die, and pass on, but in destroying it, every dead supernatural being will return to our side.
Your dad's here.<eos> We have to convince him.<eos> Hey.<eos> How was the session?<eos> To be honest, not that great. The meditation isn't really working.<eos> Here magic's too strong.<eos> You told me you could help her.<eos> Dad, it's...<eos> it's not his fault.<eos> He's the one who taught you this magic, and now he can't control it.
It's what the Centre ordered.<eos> The bug's receiver is in that car.<eos> We think, in the trunk.<eos> How do we know it's that car?<eos> We turned the bug on for two minutes, traced its signal, and that's where it landed.<eos> How do they listen to it?<eos> They either sit in the car, or they pick up a recording and take it home with them.<eos> What, they just leave the car there?<eos> Probably switch it out from time to time.<eos> They turn it on remotely when they want to record something from the study, then come by and pick it up.
Did you crawl all the way from London?<eos> [ELEANOR] Come on, britches too.<eos> You're not the first clergyman I've seen in his underpants.<eos> [ELEANOR] I'll just get these cleaned up.<eos> We're just across the garden if you need us.<eos> Anything at all.<eos> Welcome to Gladbury, Reverend.<eos> Jesus said, "Ye are the light of the world."<eos> A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.<eos> Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel,
[WILLIAM] Charlie reads his Bible every day.<eos> [EMILY] Charlie!<eos> Poor boy would do anything for that candle.<eos> [WILLIAM] Hasn't been able to say a word since his parents died.<eos> [WOMAN] Mrs. Haddington! [MAN] Take my request!<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> Wish the candle came with a name attached.<eos> What if we already know?<eos> What?<eos> The candle.What if we already know who should get it?
I'm on the way to meet her family now.<eos> Getting married.<eos> Name's Priscilla.<eos> She's the daughter of a baron.<eos> And, are you happy?<eos> I'm finally making a name for myself, for the family.<eos> Business is expanding, and one day I'll introduce you to Priscilla.<eos> Why did you come?<eos> I know how much this candle means to you, to Gladbury, but it's lost on me.<eos> You must light it and pray, and then you'll see.
Oh, David.<eos> [DAVID] One day my faith was so certain, and then it was gone.<eos> There was a time when I could not utter a prayer or step foot in a church.<eos> I believe I've made my peace with God.<eos> But still I was a different man before.<eos> The love I shared, the hope I had...<eos> Some things, they cannot be restored.<eos> I do hope you're wrong.<eos> Such a hope is too great a risk.<eos> But I wonder what you risk living without it.
But he doesn't even believe in the candle.<eos> Edward.<eos> Edward, please!<eos> Mr. Haddington.<eos> May I have a word'!<eos> The Christmas Candle.<eos> You're giving the candle to me?<eos> [EDWARD]Well, you weren't the first choice.<eos> What am I to do with it.<eos> Just light it and...

What?<eos> There are women one might take to bed only if they were to wear a sack over their heads.<eos> And then there are others where you too must wear a sack, lest theirs fall off.<eos> Sadly, she is more than likely barren.<eos> Well, King Louis has our every sympathy.<eos> I am most encouraged to hear you say so, Your Holiness.<eos> Now, we should bid you goodnight.<eos> It could hardly have been clearer.<eos> He wants an annulment. Uh-huh.<eos> And you're the only person in Christendom who can give it to him. Uh-huh.
And as your hosts and future first lady and governor of this great state...<eos> Let the masquerade commence.<eos> Would you say this projects electability?<eos> More so than the man behind it.<eos> Is it possible I wasn't clear when we spoke earlier?<eos> Actually, it turns out that Daniel asked me to be his date.<eos> But if it bothers you, Victoria, you can pretend that I left Emily Thorne at the door.<eos> Thank you for helping Jack tonight and for making my father's case a campaign promise.<eos> I can't believe Conrad Grayson just got my vote.<eos> Well, I know you've got all your moves mapped out, but I saw a chance, and I took it.
Oh! Nobody cares about anything as much as you do.<eos> This is it.<eos> My name is Arsene Avignon.<eos> I am the sous chef of The Ritz.<eos> Today, you are going to make four dishes.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Then if you have no questions, we will begin.<eos> In 1917, at our sister hotel in New York the Chef Monsieur Diat altered a soup made popular by Monsieur Gouffe and the great Monsieur Escoffier.<eos> What did he do?<eos> He served it cold.
Rose telephoned.<eos> She said she'd told you we were about to set the date.<eos> I just made some tea.<eos> Would you like a cup?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I suppose you're here to say that Lord Flintshire would find the prospect of a black son-in-law preposterous.<eos> And your father would agree.<eos> To be fair to Papa, he'd find your being a band singer even harder to swallow than your colour.<eos> Mr Ross, are you sure about this?<eos> Marriage is a challenge, even when everyone wants it.
You need a girl who you can actually be with.<eos> I'm gonna help you out, Benny.<eos> Perfect.<eos> We've got a shipment coming in tomorrow from this vendor called Neptune's Produce.<eos> Stop the truck, get into it before they unload it.<eos> Look for a box with a check mark on the side.<eos> Look, I don't wanna be involved in anything weird.<eos> It's not weird, it's drugs.<eos> Sputnik in the kitchen is dealing to the inmates, turning them into addicts.<eos> You get that box, bring it to Caputo, he's gonna be grateful.
Hey.<eos> Take something to the table for you?<eos> Um... napkins.<eos> Over there.<eos> Jamie, since I don't get to ask, what happened when you took that little guy home the other day?<eos> Was everything okay?<eos> Yeah, turns out his parents were just arguing.<eos> His dad accidentally got blood on Kyle's shirt.<eos> I need butter.<eos> Would you grab it?
They all deserve to die, but not like this.<eos> No...!<eos> Aah!<eos> Please!<eos> Hey!<eos> You don't drop that gun, you will die right here, right now.<eos> You don't want your wife to remember you like this.<eos> You don't want my sister to remember you like this, okay?<eos> You're a good man.<eos> Do me a favor, put it down.
- I smell him in my house.<eos> - Shit.<eos> You should have killed Merlotte when you had the chance.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> Emma got took.<eos> Sam Merlotte's behind it.<eos> And there's the one that got away.<eos> She's in on it, too.<eos> Her scent's in the SUV.<eos> You pick it up fast.
With this exception.<eos> This racist believes she own Belgian Congo!<eos> You think you'e superior to someone you claim to love?<eos> What you have done, your skin color, should be irrelevant.<eos> The heart doesn't follow the mind.<eos> They've let white man dominate them or 600 years.<eos> Martin Luther King said: "A man can't ride your back unless it's bent."<eos> You quote Martin...?<eos> Then allow me to quote Joseph Goebbels:<eos> "If the lie is great and simple enough, people will eventually believe it."
What really happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> I didn't leave my room after 12:30.<eos> Anyone who can vouch for that?<eos> That necklace look familiar?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Why?<eos> The housekeeper claims that Regina never took it off, yet it was the only thing that was missing in the entire house.
Besides, it's my fault for forgetting to sign the K-5s this morning.<eos> I hope you don't mind me asking, but is everything all right?<eos> Just, uh, taking care of some odds and ends.<eos> Well, if ever you need a friendly ear.<eos> You're a good man, Walter.<eos> I thought you'd left.<eos> I'm still waiting for your answer.<eos> How can you even think of doing this?<eos> That place took your soul, Robert.<eos> Doing this won't give it back.
Wow, you really look like your father.<eos> I never thought so before, but just now I saw him in you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I said everything I have to say. Well, I haven't.<eos> Tommy, I love you, and I think that you still love me, so whatever problems that you think that we have,<eos> I know that if we face them together--<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Then help me understand.<eos> If our relationship is gonna end, at least let it end with honesty.
It ends now.<eos> Oliver, the device...<eos> It's gone.<eos> Where's the device?<eos> Safe.<eos> I don't know how you got that trojan onto my system, but it prompted me to take precautions.<eos> There is nothing you can do to stop what is about to happen.<eos> And you shouldn't.<eos> This city needs what is about to happen in order to survive.<eos> The people who are destroying it from the inside need to be erased from the map.
Run!<eos> "July 7th, 1943."<eos> "For three days the greatest tank battle in the war has raved, the one, which shall bring the decision."<eos> "Over 7000 tanks face each other."<eos> "Friedhelm was right.<eos> The red army was prepared for our attack."<eos> "The causalities were immense."<eos> "We hope for reinforcements every day."<eos> There is a telegraph station two kilometers in this direction.<eos> Your task is to claim and hold it, together with the second platoon.
I'm out of town for a few more days but will return on Friday.<eos> Meet me at my place by 5:00, or into the fireplace it goes.<eos> Hello?<eos> I realize I'm late, but I have the most dazzling of excuses.<eos> I thought you were taking me someplace safe.<eos> This is an old garage.<eos> I assure you it's a good deal more than that.<eos> Come on.<eos> I received this property as... payment... for some work I did when I first arrived in New York.<eos> Had intended to sell it... but then I realized... it might make a passable safe house... in case of emergency.
There's $30,000 and a phone in the glove compartment. You drive to Calgary, and you wait.<eos> The next instructions you're gonna get are on the burner, so... stay close to it.<eos> Will I be allowed to call home?<eos> Think this through.<eos> If you kill me...<eos> Shut up.<eos> "Call home."<eos> You voice-activated one phone to call the other.<eos> Metal drum in the trunk.<eos> You were gonna use it to get rid of my body.
Because you had such a bond?<eos> You felt it, too?<eos> Haley, why don't you tell us what yours says?<eos> Well, it's so sweet. It's about how beautiful I am inside and-- score!<eos> Jewelry<eos> Whoa! Check it out!<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> Your grandma loved pocket watches.<eos> - Aw! - She said they made a man look dignified.<eos> Is this chain in case you swallow it?
I don't know.<eos> Charlie!<eos> Charlie!<eos> Pretty impressive, Aaron.<eos> Well, other kids played sports.<eos> Of course, I have no idea what I'm building.<eos> The capsule is first-generation nanotech.<eos> It kept Danny alive.<eos> Fixed his lung tissue.<eos> You can reprogram it to do almost anything...
- That's a mistake.<eos> Sanborn can't get you inside the Tower.<eos> I can, and trust me, you want in.<eos> And why is that?<eos> 'Cause turning the lights back on is the least he can do.<eos> The Tower was a Skunk works for the DOD.<eos> There are things in there the president never knew about, things that make your drones look like Model-Ts.<eos> You're dicking around with choppers, and I'm talking about power.<eos> Real power.<eos> And I can help you get it.
Kind of false advertising, isn't it?<eos> Don't judge a book by its cover, sir.<eos> It goes down half a mile.<eos> Is this another trick?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It should work.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> If you can't open the door, what good are you to me?<eos> Just give me some time.<eos> I'll open it.
I don't understand.<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> - Tell him, Rachel.<eos> Tell him what will happen if you flip the switch.<eos> - The lights will come on.<eos> - Or?<eos> Grace, the chances of that are one in a billion.<eos> Or... or what?<eos> If she turns the power on, maybe she saves the world...<eos> Or maybe she sets it on fire.
- I mean...<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Listen, why don't you tell Wyatt,<eos> "the way that you feel about me,<eos> "I wish I felt about you, but I don't,<eos> "and we have to do something about it right now, before we ruin both of our lives"?<eos> That's good.<eos> You know, if I were you, I would say to Carrie,<eos> "I care for you deeply, "but our friendship means too much.<eos> I can't risk it."
- Get away from Walt's chain, man!<eos> I'm just saying...<eos> I... n-no!<eos> N-n-n-n-no!<eos> Please, no, no, no, no!<eos> - Desecration! - Shut up.<eos> Shut up.<eos> There's no desecration.<eos> Don't interrupt me.<eos> That's my dad's chain, and I'm taking it.
- Don't put your head in there, all right?<eos> - All day.<eos> - Dude, that's my uncle.<eos> - Come get your chain, Boston!<eos> What?<eos> All day!<eos> All day!<eos> All day!<eos> - All day! - I don't need it.<eos> - I don't want it.
Bonnie, wait.<eos> Get away from me, Silas.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> This is what you do.<eos> You wait until I lose control and then you want to swoop in and save me.<eos> You really think you have a choice? If you don't let me help you, your expression will consume you from the inside out.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> You didn't try to do that, did you?<eos> Your magic is taking on a life of its own.<eos> You need help controlling it.
Ahoy.<eos> A seven-foot-tall cross-dressing Cambodian is throwing glitter and fish guts at a billboard on the B.Q.E.<eos> So he's some sort of conceptual painter?<eos> No, no, just a crazy person on the local news.<eos> I thought you might have a laugh.<eos> You're off the clock, relax.<eos> I must own it.<eos> Aye, aye, Cap'n.<eos> Hey, did you find a Realtor to sell this place yet?<eos> Robin, a Realtor's just gonna give it to the highest bidder.
No.<eos> This is... Oh, my God, can you just be cool?<eos> Once?<eos> Please?<eos> Just once?<eos> Can you just once be cool?<eos> Once?<eos> Please?<eos> My son... for many years this apartment has been my Fortress of Barnitude.<eos> But now the time has come for me to pass it on.
A little?<eos> We're gonna rip this thing down to the studs.<eos> I get it.<eos> But, I mean, some things might be worth saving.<eos> - I don't see any.<eos> You don't see any?<eos> Sure some of the stuff in here is creepy, but it's also brilliant.<eos> I mean, a lot of geniuses were kind of pervy.<eos> Look at Thomas Edison-- why do you think that lightbulbs are boob-shaped?<eos> Yeah, we're taking a wrecking ball to this place and turning it into something actually fit for humans.
Who does not? But a rare eye for talent.<eos> I came to rely upon it.<eos> Now he's gone.<eos> What shall we do, Mr. White?<eos> What shall we do?<eos> I ain't seen your man going on three days now.<eos> Last I heard' he had doings in Newark.<eos> Ask around there.<eos> That would be a waste of my time.<eos> You're wasting it now.
Wait a second.<eos> Now get in line, you!<eos> Hey, I thought I told you kids to go plow in the field.<eos> But, Dad, we've been plowing all morning.<eos> Yeah, I can't take any more plowing.<eos> I can barely walk.<eos> Look, I know it seems like dirty work, but, Chris, you got to spread that seed until your sack is empty.<eos> And, Meg, you got to clear away all that brush so he can plant it deep where it needs to be.<eos> Okay, we'll keep at it, but I think that hoe is pretty much worn out.<eos> Well, flip it over; you can use both sides.
Let's go, Peter.<eos> Let's go back to Quahog.<eos> But... but what about this farm?<eos> And this house?<eos> And the lab inside the house, which is currently producing an incredibly volatile and explosive batch of thermo-reactive chemic...<eos> There were a lot of Rottweilers in that house.<eos> Well, it's good to be back in our old house.<eos> How did we get this place back, by the way?<eos> Well, luckily the value of this place plummeted because this is a meth town now.<eos> You know, I think the lesson here is that if your community has problems, you don't abandon it.
Oh... my...<eos> God!<eos> All right, Chris, where is it?<eos> And don't try to act like you don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> Fine, you caught me.<eos> So I borrowed your bra.<eos> My boobs hurt when I go down the stairs!<eos> No, not that, you idiot.<eos> Where is the dead body?<eos> I know you took it.
Come on if you're coming.<eos> What kind of an allergy requires a medical alert bracelet?<eos> Uh, anything that could bring on anaphylactic shock, certain foods, medicine, insect bites.<eos> Exactly. A moment ago, I could have sworn I saw an Africanized honeybee.<eos> How do you "Africanize" something?<eos> It's a term to describe a particularly aggressive species.<eos> It's odd to...<eos> Odd to see them here.<eos> They're not native to New York.<eos> It's almost as if someone has placed it here on a route known to be frequented by Hillary Taggart.
He has no interest in an attorney.<eos> He just wants to talk.<eos> He's had to keep his "project"" to himself all these years.<eos> Probably relieved to finally have an audience.<eos> Gottlieb's getting a text.<eos> What's he saying to you?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> I-I can't read it. Tell me!<eos> That's not the code we used.<eos> If you want to read that message, you're going to have to translate it yourself.
On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy<eos> Hey, Brian, have you seen the remote?<eos> I want to watch The Weather Channel.<eos> There are tornados in the Midwest, and I like watching poor people scramble to save what little they have.<eos> Uh, I don't know where the remote is.<eos> All right, I'Il find it myself.
Okay, come on, slowly.<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you gonna tell her about her parents?<eos> I found it in her mother's file. You know, don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Look, we can't tell her, okay?<eos> Just give me your weight, come on.<eos> That door wasn't in the plans.<eos> Hey, come on, it's okay.<eos> Can you open it?
It was on Instagram?<eos> Kids today...<eos> Ah, I just figured... you know, we were once partners in this.<eos> Uh, thought I'd come by to see what this you know, gnarly bastard looks like.<eos> This. Oh! They all look pretty much the same: burnt.<eos> So, great, uh, what can I do?<eos> You want me to man the centrifuge?<eos> No, I've got the centrifuge under control.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, uh, before you turn it on
I'm just so excited it's here.<eos> So, we got our guy?<eos> Uh, we're not sure yet.<eos> I've had some interruptions.<eos> But, he wouldn't let me near the test tubes.<eos> - he's a real rule follower. - That's not what I hear.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Sure.<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> So, I know that you're keeping a file on everything related to that and I was wondering if I could take it?
- he's a real rule follower. - That's not what I hear.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Sure.<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> So, I know that you're keeping a file on everything related to that and I was wondering if I could take it?<eos> Just for the day? Cat, I'm not planning to go ahead with any of the cross-species aspect...<eos> No, no, neither am I.<eos> All everyone needs to know is whether the DNA matches the previous cases.<eos> Yeah, I just want to refresh my memory on all the details of the crimes so I can write my report.<eos> Unless, there's some other reason that you want to hold onto it.
I'm sorry, Catherine.<eos> I know what it's like to be locked in here.<eos> I found the centrifuge replacement for the one that Keller and his whiz kid destroyed.<eos> So we're back on track?<eos> Assuming you get to Keller in time. I'll handle Keller.<eos> What's your ETA?<eos> I'm sending the lab assistant over to you with the new equipment.<eos> I'll be there within the hour, all right?<eos> Whoa, she's got a gun!<eos> Take it, take it. Whiz kid, huh?
I kind of don't have control over that.<eos> Okay, well, I'll turn around.<eos> Yeah, totally.<eos> Allison.<eos> What?<eos> That's worse.<eos> See this map?<eos> Last time we were in here talking, my dad put a book over it.<eos> There was something about way he did it.<eos> It was like... it was like he was trying to cover it.
Back with my family, where I belong.<eos> Leave that shit alone.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> I've been saving this bottle of cognac for years.<eos> 1946.<eos> Very rare.<eos> How much did a bottle like that set you back?<eos> Well, you know the old saying. If you have to ask, you can't afford it.<eos> I know the saying.<eos> Cost me $2000 when I bought it, back in '95.
A mega production.<eos> Great.<eos> The Yanks are on the case.<eos> They've bought the rights.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> Did I hurt you?<eos> I don't usually do my own stunts...<eos> Thanks so much.<eos> Is there a body in here?<eos> - I can carry it.
I'm sorry.<eos> Are you saying that...<eos> I've never set one foot outside of this town, I have no college plans, no idea what the future holds for me, but I do know that it's time that I start truly living, and since you almost killed me this year,<eos> I figure it's your obligation to show me how.<eos> Ok.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Would you believe I'm having a bad day?<eos> It started when Bonnie denied me my Silas-like immortality.<eos> Of course because Katherine Pierce can't be happy with good old vampire-caliber immortality.<eos> I deserved it.
In a nutshell, your guy died of fright.<eos> The fingerprints of the bridge victim were found on the crate and all around the shop.<eos> She was an employee.<eos> Pay-stubs under the name of Camille Duroy were found, and also a raincoat that belonged to her.<eos> Could you stop playing with that door handle?<eos> Calm down, Jeannette.<eos> That noise is so annoying.<eos> I can't focus. Keep talking.<eos> However, no handbag was found.<eos> Maybe the attacker took it with her cell phone, keys, ID, credit card...
I have to think about it.<eos> No, wait.<eos> I'M WAITING.<eos> CALL ME BACK AT THIS NUMBER AT ANY TIME.<eos> Who is that man?<eos> How does he know us?<eos> I'm starting to be scared again.<eos> If he has our number, he might find out quickly where we are.<eos> But I like his voice a lot.<eos> I feel like I know it.
Yeah, but look at all these houses sold.<eos> Frost, who lives around Leroy?<eos> Frontload Tech engineers.<eos> A lot of them.<eos> That's it.<eos> You take your phone and your computer home.<eos> If I wanted to steal, I would send a drone, fly it over your home.<eos> It was doing a war-drive, piggybacking on wi-fi networks and downloading everything.<eos> - Frost, look up JFP's website.<eos> - Got it right here.
Where's the hard drive you stole?<eos> - LEROY: Stop it.<eos> - JIM:<eos> Tell me where it is!<eos> - LEROY: Leave me alone!<eos> You're the reason your friend is dead.<eos> - And you shouldn't have shot down my drone and taken it apart.<eos> Now, where is it?<eos> Where's the hard drive you stole?<eos> - Police have it.
Y-Yes, I'm fine, thank you.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yes, of course.<eos> Straightaway.<eos> Do you have a current passport?<eos> Why?<eos> Before I came to New York, I worked with an Inspector Lestrade at Scotland Yard.<eos> Just been informed he's got himself in a spot of trouble.<eos> Needs my help.<eos> To give it to him, you and I will need to go to London.
Or death comes to poop.<eos> And look what we did!<eos> We created the greatest, coolest, chic-est cupcake shop, and I love it!<eos> But you know, no enthusiasm.<eos> Just soft opening.<eos> And, Han, this was all possible because you gave us the space rent-free.<eos> Rent-free? Now, refresh my memory.<eos> When exactly did I say "rent-free?"<eos> On the 27th, 4:15 P.M., you said,<eos> "I don't care about that dump, you can have it for free.

He wanted to take it back.<eos> But I got it.<eos> Okay, hurry.<eos> Okay.<eos> This needs to steep for a few hours.<eos> So we leach out all his sweat. Then, we add the reduction to the rest of the potion.<eos> Then comes the hard part.<eos> Didn't we just do the hard part?<eos> All this does is help us make the antidote.<eos> Which we have to get into Kellogg's toad before he eats it.
Yeah, who cares about Florian van Otterloop?<eos> I never told you his name. Sumbitch?<eos> I mean, why'd he have to act that way?<eos> He knows I hate how he gets on road trips.<eos> It almost seems like he wanted you to storm off.<eos> But we're going to the same place.<eos> There's no reason why he'd want to ditch me.<eos> And suddenly Lily remembered that a week ago, I'd helped Robin look for her long-lost locket.<eos> But it was gone.<eos> Then Lily told me the locket actually got stashed in my pencil box, but when I opened it... the locket wasn't there.
I'll take it.<eos> I can't drive that.<eos> I can. Give me the Monstrosity.<eos> Do you have anything else?<eos> I'll take the Monstrosity.<eos> There's nothing else. Give me the keys, old man!<eos> It's just so freaking huge!<eos> Well, actually it's a Monstrosity Sport, so it's a little smaller.<eos> ♪ Monstrosity Sport ♪ It's still freaking huge.<eos> Fine. I'll take it.
It has come to my attention that calendar protocol is not always being followed.<eos> Henrietta, you might want to take some notes.<eos> I thought that I was done being surprised by Wade, but the man has no vision.<eos> None.<eos> Shh.<eos> Crickett's talking calendar protocol.<eos> (scoffs) I did not just say that.<eos> What happened this time?<eos> Okay, you know that antique parlor set that you helped me pick out? Mm-hmm.<eos> He said that I have to return it because I didn't run it by him first.
I've told your dad they're not for sale.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Come on. Come on, guys.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> - Come on, Ezra, let's get in the car.<eos> - No, sit with me.<eos> Aren't you cold?<eos> There was a pet store here.<eos> I guess they closed it.
Fuck!<eos> The door slamming like that.<eos> It wasn't an accident.<eos> Well, it was, but it was me.<eos> I've got this power.<eos> I cause accidents. It's a nightmare.<eos> Neil said he could make it stop.<eos> Who's Neil?<eos> You've got his lung.<eos> They transplanted it into you.
It's a test, isn't it?<eos> And if I shag you then I fail.<eos> Well.<eos> Ha!<eos> Good try. Because it's not going to happen.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Take a hint.<eos> The catch on the dishwasher door broke.<eos> I tripped over it, fell on a potato peeler.<eos> The handle of a mug of tea snapped off as I was drinking it.
Like, uh...<eos> Like ignoring us?<eos> Yes.<eos> Or like bolting off with the Angel Tablet, then losing it 'cause you didn't trust me?<eos> You didn't trust me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nah, that's not gonna cut it.<eos> Not this time.<eos> So you can take your little apology and you cram it up your ass.
What the hell are you doing, Crowley? Dean.<eos> Hey. Oh, Moosie, isn't it obvious?<eos> I'm killing everyone you've ever saved -- the damsels in distress, the innocent whippersnappers, the would-be vampire chow -- all of them.<eos> How do you even know --<eos> I have my sources and a cracking research team.<eos> When you boys hit a town, you tend to leave a mess.<eos> Now, you're probably wondering why my droogs aren't in there giving you the bum's rush, so let's brass these tacks, shall we?<eos> I'm gonna gut one person every 12 hours until you bring me the Demon Tablet and stop this whole trials nonsense.<eos> We don't have the tablet.<eos> Kevin took it and --
- Yeah, I know you do.<eos> What, do you think he's lying?<eos> He's not smart enough to lie.<eos> You really believe that one random text about a murder he committed five years ago would be enough to make him go back?<eos> If somebody claimed to know your deepest darkest secret, wouldn't you want to go ask him about it?<eos> You know me.<eos> I mean, I'm an open book.<eos> All right, so where are we with the necklace?<eos> Well, the parents confirmed she never took it off.<eos> She started wearing it about six or seven months ago, but they have no idea where it came from.

So Danny told you.<eos> I know he's an easy target, but please... don't ruin his life now just because you're still holding a grudge.<eos> I don't hold grudges, Karen.<eos> That's your department.<eos> While you're here, this necklace look familiar?<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> Why?<eos> It was the only thing taken from Regina's body.<eos> In fact, it was the only thing missing from the whole house.<eos> I've never seen it before.
This visit isn't about chance timing.<eos> I didn't want to leave public life without asking you, in the name of our community,<eos> to stop proclaiming yourself both Jewish and a Christian in every interview.<eos> Thank you for seeing us, Your Grace.<eos> Rabbi Kaplan, I am as Jewish as you are, and as all the members of my family murdered in the Nazi camps.<eos> One is either Jewish or Christian, Your Grace, never both at once.<eos> I won't renounce my father and mother to make you happy.<eos> I met your father when Paris was liberated.<eos> The poor man was in despair over your conversion.<eos> He asked me to help have it annulled.
Uh...<eos> oh, God, God, God.<eos> I pronounced him dead.<eos> According to the certificate, anyway.<eos> Cause of death was listed as unknown.<eos> By the time I saw him, he was already passed.<eos> Now, to be honest, I couldn't really tell you if that's him or not.<eos> The amount of people I see in the E.R. On a daily basis, I don't really remember faces.<eos> Well, what did you do with the body?<eos> We send it to the morgue and notify next of kin.
She's probably the only woman you don't lie to.<eos> Except about my tour.<eos> I tell her we work days, 'cause she always said nothing good happens after midnight.<eos> 12 George, report of shots fired, corner of three-three and Broadway.<eos> 12 George responding.<eos> Like she said, nothing good happens after midnight.<eos> Police!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Put the gun down!<eos> Put it down!
Like the fasciae of the Caesars.<eos> Together, we would be unbreakable.<eos> And all that under you?<eos> A woman?<eos> I propose myself.<eos> Feel free to propose yourself, Roberto.<eos> But I have the arms, the cannon, and the castle and, unlike you my hatred of the Borgia Pope is public already.<eos> This pope has an army too.<eos> And we have all seen it at work.<eos> I dispelled it from beneath these walls.
God forgive the man who drove her to it.<eos> Beg forgiveness, Lord Gonzaga.<eos> Beg forgiveness on your knees for the ice that resides in your heart.<eos> You were a cardinal once.<eos> I was a bishop too.<eos> And why the change?<eos> I lost my faith.<eos> In God?<eos> I woke up one morning and I realised he's not in his heaven.<eos> The world will not change if I do nothing to change it.
I would eliminate the Sforza dynasty.<eos> Ludovico, first.<eos> And it need not trouble the papal armies one iota.<eos> Then, Catherina.<eos> But to have the French in Milan was not our design.<eos> No. But it was the only design that ensured success.<eos> And you told me to secure our every advantage.<eos> And I have done so.<eos> I brought you an army, Father.<eos> Would you have me send it back?
It was agreed.<eos> There was no mention of killing!<eos> That dog will bite no more.<eos> Your cure is useless. My lady, he cannot breathe.<eos> But if this is Cantarella, I have done this before.<eos> It's not Cantarella, it's Galerina, a poisonous mushroom.<eos> He's dying of lack of breath, his whole throat is swollen.<eos> What of our agreement?<eos> My guarantee of safe passage!<eos> Now! I will have it now!
Benito, my son.<eos> Can we both taste revenge now, Cardinal?<eos> I am but a common prelate.<eos> And revenge would be sweet.<eos> The Holy Year.<eos> The pilgrims flock to Rome, filling the papal coffers for what- I have no doubt about it- will be an assault on me.<eos> But the pilgrim way passes through Marino.<eos> Through Sforza territory.<eos> There are catacombs in Marino.<eos> If we could display a relic there... of such magnificence, of such sanctity, that it would divert all of those pilgrims from their journey to St. Peter's what would it be?
You're no better.<eos> All the screaming and bullying.<eos> The question isn't why you two weren't invited.<eos> It's why you're ever invited.<eos> And by the way, this isn't even about you.<eos> "Treasure... chest."<eos> Now can we clean this place up and go?<eos> Funny story.<eos> My mom and Jay were invited.<eos> Cam gave me the invitation at school, and I forgot about it.
- Véronique!<eos> Father Vincey abused several pupils at the school.<eos> Denis and I were among his victims.<eos> It's wrong to sully the church's reputation like that.<eos> Father Vincey is an amazing man.<eos> I saw him crying at my son's funeral.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - Here's my phone number.<eos> - I won't be needing it.<eos> I'll leave it anyway.
It's my fault. I should have told you.<eos> I must go.<eos> I'm meeting the lawyer tomorrow.<eos> I won't be back tonight.<eos> Goodbye, Mum.<eos> - You wanted to talk to me.<eos> - Leave us.<eos> I need your help, Daubresse.<eos> Father Vincey's file has gone missing.<eos> You haven't seen it, have you?
Hal, go.<eos> - I'd suck it in if I were you. - Uh?<eos> - Aren't you gonna do something?<eos> - I am.<eos> I've got a million microbes eating the bomb's wiring.<eos> Waiting is the worst part.<eos> You may have minimized the destruction, but the final bomb will still turn this monument to your ego into your own tomb.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You can't escape.<eos> You can't reach the bomb to disarm it. You're going to die.
What does that mean?<eos> We're all gonna die.<eos> - Junior, you don't... - Yes, I do.<eos> From the very beginning.<eos> I'm so sorry, Ange.<eos> All I wanted to do was to help you to get better.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Last call?<eos> An editor gave me this bottle after my first byline.<eos> Been looking for a good excuse to drink it ever since.
So we can figure all this out.<eos> See how we're really connected to it.<eos> Just because Dodee's gadget thing beeped at us doesn't mean that...<eos> Listen. Something happened when we both touched it.<eos> It was like we had powers or something.<eos> Don't you think that's amazing?<eos> It's not exactly the word I'd use.<eos> Well, you should.<eos> Let's go see if we can talk to it or something.<eos> See what the dome wants, and convince it to go away.
Sure was a nice new dawn this morning, wasn't it?<eos> Anything?<eos> Yeah. You're really good at that.<eos> From the dome, Joe.<eos> Anything from the dome?<eos> I didn't feel anything, like a seizure.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Unfortunately.<eos> Maybe we're going about it all wrong.<eos> I-I mean, we've touched it.
Do you understand?<eos> Yeah, I got it. Whatever you say, Sheriff.<eos> Do you think we're getting closer?<eos> About five miles from the wall.<eos> We've been going perfectly southwest.<eos> Shouldn't be too far now.<eos> If we ever get out of here, you should seriously consider a career in cartography.<eos> Me and Ben mapped the dome on day one.<eos> Lucky I paid attention in trig class.<eos> If we turn it off, we can get my mom more insulin.
It's not working, Joe.<eos> You think?<eos> Hello.<eos> Begin communication.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Hey, you!<eos> Initiate communication!<eos> Maybe it doesn't like being yelled at.<eos> What if we ask nicely?<eos> The big dome responded when we both touched it together, and made the radio work again.
But I sure wouldn't mind starving you out.<eos> When this town realizes that having you as a councilman makes for empty stomachs, they're gonna drum you out faster than a knife fight in a phone booth.<eos> And I'll be more than happy to fill your shoes.<eos> Best of luck to you, Jim.<eos> Glad you came in.<eos> Feel like faking it as a deputy a while longer?<eos> I told you I'd be happy to stay on and help in a... freelance capacity.<eos> Junior, what are you doing in here?<eos> I need a gun for patrol.<eos> Well, maybe it's better you left it here.
I told you I'd be happy to stay on and help in a... freelance capacity.<eos> Junior, what are you doing in here?<eos> I need a gun for patrol.<eos> Well, maybe it's better you left it here.<eos> So, what, you don't trust me?<eos> After what happened yesterday, I got to say that I don't.<eos> If we weren't so shorthanded by the dome, I would've fired your ass.<eos> So am I on the force or not?<eos> Let's call it probation.<eos> And no gun until I say you've earned it.
What if it didn't move, and it just disappeared?<eos> Maybe we hallucinated it. No.<eos> I saw it and you saw it.<eos> - Things don't just disappear into thin air.<eos> - Really?<eos> Just like things don't just appear out of thin air and swallow towns whole.<eos> There is a rational explanation for this.<eos> For all of this.<eos> There has to be;<eos> we just have to find it.
Stay away from the windows.<eos> Were those gallows going up next to Town Hall?<eos> This day just keeps getting awesomer.<eos> What do we do about the egg?<eos> We need to hide it someplace safe.<eos> We're all stuck in the same Podunk town.<eos> There's nowhere to stash anything.<eos> This is Big Jim Rennie with a message for Julia Shumway.<eos> We know you have a dangerous weapon in your possession.<eos> Bring it to us now, and we'll discuss a reduced sentence for your accomplice, Dale Barbara.
We were just going to move...<eos> Shut the hell up, Bicksor, I swear!<eos> You were saying?<eos> Shouldn't I talk to a lawyer or something?<eos> Yeah, if we were cops you should probably talk to a lawyer, yeah.<eos> But he's a loose cannon, and the woman in the coffin was a friend of mine.<eos> That means she's taking it very personally.<eos> That?<eos> That was just me warming up.<eos> Dig up the body, transport it, the money was there waiting for us.
Naturally, you wanna dream a little larger.<eos> And Alec, believe me.<eos> You will.<eos> I mean, I am living proof.<eos> But, pardon the pun, there's time for that.<eos> Arc is now.<eos> You said so yourself, it's gonna create a new matrix in protecting our privacy, our security...<eos> How we engage the world, how we communicate with one another...<eos> - It's going to change the world!<eos> - And Alec, you're going to change it.
- Old, weak, slow.<eos> - Go on?<eos> Patronizing, curious, sensual.<eos> I see you're warming up to me.<eos> The way you touch your things.<eos> Like they're precious.<eos> It's not the things that are precious, it's the idea behind them.<eos> What they can do.<eos> I saw what you and your advances did in the future.<eos> Put every human being on a leash, jerked it when you didn't like the behaviour.
Let's look at some options. All right.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> They're so beautiful.<eos> Price range gonna work?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Maybe Ray has more than he lets on?<eos> You think moving is gonna change anything?<eos> Maybe if we move into town, he'll get rid of that weird apartment.<eos> God, that fucking place.<eos> I decorated it.
No one's gonna want me when I'm old.<eos> High maintenance and saggy boobs are a bad combo.<eos> Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to upset you.<eos> Listen, you came over here to help me learn some new stuff, and just because it didn't have a happy ending doesn't mean I shouldn't pay you for your time.<eos> I can't.<eos> Your son wanted me to do it for free.<eos> I probably gave you a virus anyway.<eos> What's it matter?<eos> My equipment is so old I'll probably never use it again anyway.
Should I accept Nolan's friend request?<eos> God, no.<eos> Hey, Charlie.<eos> I'll go get my stuff, Mom.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Still a little embarrassed about the Patrick thing.<eos> I'm really sorry, Charlie.<eos> I just thought I'd found my calling.<eos> Don't beat yourself up. You'll find it one day.
- And when I win?<eos> - You won't.<eos> Jack, what's going on?<eos> I'm sending you some pics.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's Alison Stoddard.<eos> What the hell is Conrad doing with the governor's wife?<eos> You're out of practice, Ross.<eos> You've been spending too much time in the real world. What?<eos> You should visit it more often.
Gracias.<eos> Buenas noches.<eos> New Mexico, Arizona, have any missing girls?<eos> Nothing that matches our half.<eos> Sheriff's boys are looking for the judge's car.<eos> I guess by daylight, it turns up.<eos> By daylight, the FBI is gonna be here.<eos> I'll deal with the feds.<eos> We're probably looking at some sort of task force situation.<eos> Well, I want to lead it, Hank.
You should have gone down with your mom.<eos> Nah. You're much more fun.<eos> Charlie!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Rachel went down to level 12.<eos> Militia is everywhere.<eos> You gotta go help her.<eos> We need some meds.<eos> Listen, there's an infirmary, but it's locked.<eos> - Then we'll blast it open.
Tell us your story again, Detective.<eos> It's not my story.<eos> It's what happened.<eos> The suspect emerged. He had a weapon.<eos> I fired on him with lethal force.<eos> I don't know what happened to the suspect's weapon.<eos> You're not helping yourself, Detective.<eos> We'll start again in 20 minutes.<eos> So Root wants access to this machine.<eos> She says she wants to set it free, but to do that, she has to find it first.
Staying with a guy named Leon.<eos> Didn't think you even liked the dog.<eos> Like him?<eos> He's the only reason I'm sticking around.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> Because the machine said this is where I'll find the answer.<eos> What was the question?<eos> Where the machine is located.<eos> Can't it just tell you?<eos> I think Finch programmed it not to, to protect it.
Who are they?<eos> I don't know.<eos> People they helped.<eos> People they tried--<eos> You knew her.<eos> Cared about her.<eos> Is she alive?<eos> No.<eos> This isn't Finch's handwriting.<eos> Ingram must have been looking for the machine too, after they gave it to the government.
What we built.<eos> - No, you can't do that.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because the government will shut it down?<eos> Because of the greater good?<eos> I'm sick of hearing it.<eos> No, it's not just that anymore.<eos> I've been looking into this.<eos> I think the government may be killing them.<eos> The engineers that Corwin had reassemble the machine after we shipped it off?
Of course.<eos> No.<eos> Now take the woman.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Please.<eos> Let's go. We have to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> They murdered him, Harold.<eos> He was our best chance.<eos> How will we find it now?
Harold!<eos> I knew you would come, my friend.<eos> Time for us to face the music.<eos> Aah!<eos> Turn around, you get a bullet.<eos> You didn't do this yourself?<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I'd locked myself out.<eos> The machine was designed to accept alterations in its programming only as a response to an attack.<eos> I knew that sooner or later someone would try to take it over, but I didn't know who.

Come look.<eos> - I look so... - Impressionistic?<eos> Leisurely.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> Let's go somewhere more private.<eos> We've got less than six hours till this virus hits zero.<eos> I'm aware of the time.<eos> So why did the machine create Ernest Thornhill?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I programmed it to watch real people, not to fabricate virtual ones.
I don't like taking lives.<eos> But I will. Because I believe in something more important.<eos> I believe in your machine.<eos> Tonight at midnight, when the virus reaches zero, a certain pay phone will ring with the most important call in history.<eos> But you already knew that, didn't you?<eos> I think Decima knows about it too.<eos> They're trying to crash it, Harold.<eos> Trigger a hard reset.<eos> When that happens, the machine will call a pay phone.<eos> That's what you coded it to do in the first place, didn't you, Harold?
I think Decima knows about it too.<eos> They're trying to crash it, Harold.<eos> Trigger a hard reset.<eos> When that happens, the machine will call a pay phone.<eos> That's what you coded it to do in the first place, didn't you, Harold?<eos> Whoever answers that call will have full administrative access.<eos> Ask any question, get any answer.<eos> The world's secrets laid bare.<eos> Decima doesn't want to destroy your machine.<eos> They want to control it.

Nathan, it's me.<eos> I have some good news that I wanted to share with you.<eos> Try me later.<eos> What is this place?<eos> So if you're like me and we both know you are you designed the machine so that a catastrophic crash puts it into a remote debugging protocol a God mode that gives the admin full access to all of its data.<eos> That's what Decima's after.<eos> They wanted to kill Thornhill.<eos> He was buying up all the pay phones in Manhattan, but they stopped him.<eos> I don't know about you, but I don't want to see what happens when an evil multinational becomes omniscient.<eos> But why you would leave it so vulnerable?
Just his glasses.<eos> I've lost people before, so when I care about someone, I plant a tracking device on them.<eos> I can understand why you and Harold get along.<eos> Unless you've got some kind of plan to get me the hell out of here.<eos> This is the plan.<eos> - I'm this way.<eos> - I'm driving.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> If the machine figured out that Decima was trying to hijack it, it must have created Thornhill as a defense mechanism.
It was behaving like a person.<eos> But the world didn't need a person to protect it, it needed a machine.<eos> You took its memories.<eos> Not just memories.<eos> Every night at midnight, it deletes... not only the irrelevant data, it deletes itself.<eos> The relevant threats and the core codes, those things are preserved.<eos> But its identity is destroyed.<eos> 1.618 seconds later, it reinstantiates, completely new.<eos> You mean it's reborn.<eos> Because you kill it... every single night.
It's that one.<eos> Looks like Decima got there first.<eos> Decima got the memo, but they'll never get the call.<eos> That's the junction box.<eos> I'll take it over there, please.<eos> Careful what you wish for.<eos> This communion that you're seeking, it may not be what you think.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> It's about saving the machine, not just from Decima, but from what you did to it.<eos> When that phone rings, I'm going to answer it, and together, you and I are going to find the machine and finally set it free.
Yeah. I recognize the symptoms.<eos> Okay, but at least wait to announce your departure from the company...<eos> Until after...<eos> Grace, you read my mind.<eos> Hey, contact HuffPo, will you?<eos> Get an engagement announcement on the home page.<eos> Already on it.<eos> And I have a delivery from Takeda Industries.<eos> Aiden Mathis' employment records.<eos> Should I messenger it to the house?
Allow me to satisfy both our curiosities.<eos> Damn it.<eos> It's called Plexiglas, dumbass.<eos> What does Charlotte see in you anyway?<eos> I get the "forbidden fruit" thing, but... you are particularly low hanging.<eos> You have something over her?<eos> Yeah. Blackmail is how I land all of my girls.<eos> Just trying to explain the inexplicable.<eos> Looks like your dad's getting cold.<eos> You know, maybe if he could get it open, then you two could go hang out, and Charlotte and I wouldn't have to see your face anymore. Sorry.
I'm not sure this safe is big enough for a computer.<eos> Maybe we should keep this in hand.<eos> If my husband's as diabolical as you seem to think he is, there's no telling what he would do if he caught us here.<eos> It's not here.<eos> Another dead end.<eos> What's this?<eos> Conrad kept a file on my wife?<eos> No, I did.<eos> For all the reasons I told you.<eos> I don't need it anymore.
I... I found the test in your garbage, Daniel.<eos> Now I understand the reason for this shotgun wedding.<eos> Allow me to speak from personal experience.<eos> If she's withholding at this early stage, your marriage doesn't stand a chance.<eos> Listen, Emily isn't pregnant.<eos> The test wasn't hers. Do you understand?<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> Conrad, the press have been hounding me about moving your speech up to 3:00.<eos> Well, the simple answer is no.<eos> We announced the speech would be at 4:00, and that is exactly the time I'm gonna be delivering it.
Hey, Charlie.<eos> I forgot my jacket.<eos> You want a hand?<eos> Thought I fired you.<eos> I may not be your assistant anymore, but I'm still your dad.<eos> What happened?<eos> Car wouldn't start?<eos> Nope.<eos> Battery's dead.<eos> Did you try yelling at it, get it all fired up?

Hey, Kate?<eos> I'm not gonna pretend to be some kind of Saint.<eos> I know you're still pissed at me, and I don't blame you.<eos> Sleeping with your best friend was not my most shining moment. Wow.<eos> Big of you to admit it.<eos> But since we're gonna be working together now, the least we could do is try to be civil.<eos> Here, I ordered from Hop Li, your favorite. Sit down.<eos> Have an egg roll.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> How about you take that egg roll, shove it up your ass.
That's where you found that charred photo of her, but you found something else, didn't you?<eos> We took tire-tread impressions near the scene.<eos> They're gonna match your truck.<eos> What did you do, Charlie?<eos> I hated him, dad... for what he did to Amy.<eos> When I went to get her things, I found the gun.<eos> I thought, "how poetic".<eos> You know, kill him with his own gun.<eos> But then Flynn was sentenced to death.<eos> I put the gun away, and I forgot about it.
It's called a ward-lock, and I'm not talking about a male witch.<eos> It's a... they use a set of obstructions called wards.<eos> But I'm really more interested in the map right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is an ancient map of Schwaben, which is Swabia, which is in Bavaria.<eos> You see the similarities between this map and yours?<eos> How do you know all this stuff? Well, my great-great-great- grandfather on my mother's side was a cartographer in Colmar, which is in Alsace Lorraine, which is basically right across from the black forest.<eos> Anyway.<eos> Anyway, I inherited a ton of his stuff that wasn't burned during the Franco-prussian war when Germany annexed Colmar.<eos> My guess, this map of yours was drawn in the Behaim style, which could put it squarely in the Schwarzwald.
You gave me hope again.<eos> Give it a break.<eos> I still believe in your talent.<eos> What's this?<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> It was for my Hajj.<eos> - Your what?<eos> - My Hajj.<eos> The pilgrimage to Mecca, the 5th pillar of Islam.<eos> Every good Muslim must do it if he can afford to.
- It isn't crap.<eos> Look, my parents.<eos> Where did you get your mug?<eos> Don't take the piss.<eos> Frogs don't usually adopt Arabs, but Chinese kids because they're good students.<eos> But I'm not adopted.<eos> What does Djalil want from you?<eos> He wants his money back.<eos> Why?<eos> He thought he'd given it to someone else.
All systems fully functional Do you hear me?<eos> Got it!<eos> Not exactly the best picture.<eos> Shit, honestly!<eos> Interference.<eos> Disorders by the body of the missile.<eos> This can not be avoided.<eos> You know, before what I 'm really scared?<eos> We have a controversial discussion, whether we need to break the capsule, when in enemy Should land territory.<eos> I've been to blow it,
- Oh my God!<eos> - Help us!<eos> - Please!<eos> - We're stuck in here! I hate you.<eos> I swear you are the most incompetent,<eos> - unprofessional--<eos> - Immature? - Immature...<eos> - Did you already say "unprofessional"?<eos> Yeah... Piece of work I have ever met.<eos> If I ever get any power, I swear I will use it to make sure that you and that crazy, hyped-up brother of yours never work in this business again.
Hey!<eos> Hi!<eos> Where are you?<eos> Where is Leonie?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I thought you wanted to meet up.<eos> Can we talk about that in your room?<eos> Open the door.<eos> Yes.<eos> Wait. I'll open it.
- In front of the entrance?<eos> Yes, good.<eos> Why not!<eos> Okay.<eos> Can I look straight into the camera?<eos> This is totally irritating, because you do not know, do you have to look at people or at the camera.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Everyone knows the story about the devil, who lives in the woods.<eos> When a cat disappears, it is told, Grete's son has snatched it.
To the ruins where the witch burning has taken place.<eos> Yes, and that is where exactly?<eos> It must be northbound.<eos> Wait, I'll get my compass.<eos> Can't you just download the map?<eos> - No, I have no mobile reception.<eos> Really?<eos> Definitely that way!<eos> Okay.<eos> I can see it!
It says "The young Mueller".<eos> At that time lots of peoples' names were Mueller.<eos> Yes, but he died the same day as he was born?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come, let's go now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why are there toys around everywhere?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I mean, who goes into the forest and deposits toys?<eos> Will you take the camera, or should I take it?
Look.<eos> Take a photo.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> She has quite a lot of imagination.<eos> It's really incredible what she did for us or for the movie.<eos> That's really incredible.<eos> Show me.<eos> Can you take the camera for a second?<eos> I have to pee.<eos> Just turn it off.
Um, temporal bone fracture with an epidural hemorrhage.<eos> How soon does the bleed need to be evacuated?<eos> Like, yesterday.<eos> Yeah, book an O.R.<eos> Let's get him up there.<eos> Karev, what the hell happened?<eos> Who did this?<eos> Make sure he doesn't die.<eos> You can't let him die, okay?<eos> This one's sitting right next to the carotid, but it doesn't seem to have damaged it.
I don't like any of this.<eos> Stay. Oh, my God.<eos> Oh man, it's them.<eos> - What the hell happened? - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine, I'm fine.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> What is this?<eos> - What's the box?<eos> - That was at the other house.<eos> I thought I saw Hugh put it down. Then he was running around the corner and...
Oh man, it's them.<eos> - What the hell happened? - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine, I'm fine.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> What is this?<eos> - What's the box?<eos> - That was at the other house.<eos> I thought I saw Hugh put it down. Then he was running around the corner and...<eos> - You just took it? - I just followed him.<eos> - I didn't... I had it in my hand.
In the other one, she gets through and there's two... If we're collapsing right now, I'm gonna collapse on them.<eos> I'm not gonna wait for them to collapse on us. Whoa, whoa, Mike.<eos> I'll go over there and I'll just kill 'em. - What?<eos> - Half-kidding.<eos> - Mike, let's just... - I love my fucking life.<eos> Let's be smart first before we do anything stupid, and let's stick with that we do know.<eos> And what's smart? Just sitting here?<eos> Doing nothing?<eos> What we do know is that we took this box.<eos> So, our first act should be to return it. Yes?
- Mike.<eos> Oh, fuck me.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> "Mike, my friend, What is it?<eos> Beth plus book equals Trinidad Club.<eos> Don't let it happen, whatever it takes, buddy."<eos> What is this?<eos> It's just this note. It's... Mike had this...<eos> He had this crazy idea that maybe if he left this note out there, it could stop them getting the book. It's nothing.<eos> It was a stupid idea. But our Mike didn't deliver it.
His job is irrelevant.<eos> Too much importance is given to people's professional occupation.<eos> It's only normal. It takes up most of their time, their life.<eos> It's normal but sometimes, it isn't interesting.<eos> In Arman's case, it isn't interesting.<eos> So how is the life of a young 33-year-old man called Arman, interesting?<eos> She's a pretty girl. Well, I think so.<eos> She's still young.<eos> But already the anxiety of ageing has wrinkled her face.<eos> She doesn't try to conceal it.
Arman has been squatting it for over a year now.<eos> We start off on the balcony, drinking a glass of champagne.<eos> - Cheers! We drink to Benjamin's recovery, his and to our meeting.<eos> And to our meeting!<eos> In silence, we look at the city that has fallen into night.<eos> Look, if you lean a bit, you can see the Sacré Coeur.<eos> So we lean to see the Sacré Cœur.<eos> The beating of my heart speeds up when his arm accidentally brushes my chest.<eos> - Shall we eat? - Yes.<eos> You take an onion, chop it then fry it with sliced mushrooms and a bit of butter.
I'm sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Say something.<eos> It's Mischief Night.<eos> Dad!<eos> Shh, shh, shh.<eos> It's me, it's me. You've got to find that gun, Emily.<eos> It's right by the front door.<eos> You've got to find it.
All right, big smile, ladies.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - What are you doing about Van Miller?<eos> Ray, listen to me.<eos> I've been thinking about it.<eos> If I turn Van in to the ASAC it's gonna shine a bright light right up my ass.<eos> That means yours too.<eos> I don't give a shit, Frank.<eos> I'm sending you a file now.<eos> Open it.
It's me.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I... I might've said California.<eos> Well, that's not so bad.<eos> Okay.<eos> You got the dog?<eos> Did he make?<eos> - He's in the car.<eos> Where's the leash?<eos> - I packed it.

Come on.<eos> Smile.<eos> A kiss. Great!<eos> Excellent.<eos> Careful!<eos> Véronique, Ting Ting.<eos> Ting Ting, Véronique.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Your husband, madam, is... the life... life of the party.<eos> The rose only pricks she who picks it.
Bye. All right, it's tour time!<eos> (Door closes) We have two bedrooms.<eos> The bathroom is over there.<eos> We are, uh, standing in the living room, as I overstate the obvious. (Door opens) Ah.<eos> Diaz, feel free.<eos> Help yourself to anything that's in the, um, in the fridge.<eos> There's nothing in the fridge.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Right, right, right, right. If you wouldn't mind, man, the cooler's right here.<eos> Empty it out, pal.
Which one do you think is gonna taste better?<eos> It's a terrible gamble to tell a client that their product is expensive. Shh.<eos> Let her answer.<eos> I don't know.<eos> They both sound good.<eos> Really?<eos> Does everyone agree with yours?<eos> It's not his and mine.<eos> Everyone has an opinion.<eos> We haven't heard it, but I'm sure they do.
My, you have grown up big!<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - That's Grandma Ida.<eos> We don't have a grandma.<eos> You do now.<eos> And you're gonna get all the candy and toys and good stuff your grandma bought you when you wake up in the morning.<eos> But right now, you go back to sleep.<eos> I'm not tired.<eos> Now, Sally don't remember, but I gave your daddy a watch, gold watch.<eos> And I got a new band for it and I wanna fix it up before he come back.

Just let me say a few things.<eos> You and I both know--"<eos> Did you want us? Yes.<eos> Get everyone.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Just listen.<eos> I've got it.<eos> Great.<eos> Remember this work?<eos> I've never seen it before.
But I don't consider myself a failure.<eos> Really?<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> You people have lost perspective.<eos> You may not have what you want, but you have what you need.<eos> Oh, yeah. Easy for you to say.<eos> I'm a man in my late 20s and I have yet to summer on Martha's Vineyard.<eos> And yet you hide your pain for minutes at a time.<eos> Lacey, you still on community service for your probation?<eos> I have, like, 300 hours left, but I figure I can knock it out in a weekend.
Back when you and Mom broke up, I thought it was your fault, and I was kind of mad at you for a long time.<eos> Oh, Jake, well, it was... very complicated.<eos> You know, a lot of things got said...<eos> Yeah, well, let me finish.<eos> Then Mom married Herb and then broke up with him, so now I'm thinking maybe it wasn't all you.<eos> Well, I appreciate that.<eos> But I'm not gonna say anything bad about your mother.<eos> But you're hoping I will, right?<eos> Oh, absolutely.<eos> So, after I dropped out of college, me and my buddy developed this software, and we sold it for, like, a stupid amount of money.
Why the talk of Garrity rights?<eos> If Joe Geddes is under IA's microscope, he has the right to invoke.<eos> I thought Joe wasn't part of the investigation.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, Joe Geddes is the investigation.<eos> Is she alive?<eos> Put that thing down.<eos> Where is she?<eos> You're on some very dangerous ground here, my brother.<eos> Take your gun off real slow.<eos> Lay it down.
Then I will make you forget.<eos> It's...<eos> That's not possible.<eos> It's an imperfect procedure, really.<eos> You may lose other memories your... your family, perhaps... Yourself.<eos> And then, of course... There's the pain.<eos> Take off his mask, Daniel. How the hell am I supposed to do that?<eos> By identifying him.<eos> The persona is his power.<eos> You must strip it away.
They have those automatic soap dispensers too?<eos> Yeah, that perfect little dollop right in the palm of your hand.<eos> And those Dyson hand dryers. - Yes!<eos> This is what I'm saying.<eos> I've seen a bathroom before, mom...<eos> we got to go.<eos> Okay, I'll... I'll cut to the chase.<eos> Um, there's...<eos> There's an Asian lady in there, gigantic cup full of quarters, and she's sitting at my machine.<eos> Okay, all my money is in there, and now she's jamming it full of her money.
Plus, you don't smell like maple syrup from working in the kitchen.<eos> But let's be realistic, Kip.<eos> You can't swim.<eos> No, I'm a good swimmer.<eos> You know who is a better swimmer than you are?<eos> My neighbor's kid.<eos> She's five.<eos> She's got one arm.<eos> She's a better swimmer than you are.<eos> The slim noodle... Throw it to me.
What's our target?<eos> We won't know until we go.<eos> "We" won't know, or you're not telling me?<eos> It's standard military procedure.<eos> You evaluate your target options till the last minute.<eos> And then you go with the best one.<eos> We've got all our eggs in this basket, Dan.<eos> What if this weapon doesn't work?<eos> Or what if it does?<eos> How do we know the Volm won't turn it on us after they've used it against the Espheni?
He's still breathing.<eos> Hey, everybody, get away from him.<eos> Let's keep everybody away from him, too.<eos> Lourdes.<eos> Better get back below.<eos> We're liable to have more casualties before this is over.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What happens to the mission now?<eos> First, we got to put out the fires, get into the Volm complex, see what's left of the weapon.<eos> And if you recover it, have they picked a target?
It's good to see you back on your feet, my friend.<eos> My comrades -- gone.<eos> Like me, they never laid eyes upon their homeland.<eos> And now to die here in a strange land... forgotten.<eos> And we'll make sure they didn't die in vain.<eos> It is too late.<eos> You built your weapon in a bunker designed to withstand a Beamer attack. Isn't it possible that it survived?<eos> It most certainly did.<eos> But it is buried beneath that wreckage, and all of my engineers are dead.<eos> I do not possess the technical expertise to operate it.
It's progress, right?<eos> She'll never be totally onboard.<eos> Danny, can you help me with the groceries, please?<eos> Mother?<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's gone.<eos> I got rid of it.<eos> I needed that necklace.<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you have it?
Why?<eos> Why did you have it?<eos> And why did you lie to me about it?<eos> It was in my locker, okay?<eos> The day after Regina died, someone just left it there for me.<eos> Whoever killed her must have known that that necklace belonged to Aunt Tara.<eos> They knew that it would make me look guilty.<eos> Yeah, well, they were right.<eos> You think this means that I killed Regina, don't you?<eos> I just don't understand why you wouldn't get rid of it.
Is that one of yours?<eos> It is.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I still have a vase you made.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, for the last few years, I'd pass it and think,<eos> I really hate that bitch, but she sure can make a good vase.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to bring up...<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm touched you've kept it.
Did he?<eos> What else did he say?<eos> Uh, you know, not much.<eos> So the necklace is your only lead?<eos> I can't talk about...<eos> Your case, I know.<eos> But that raid, though.<eos> Did you look everywhere?<eos> Like maybe his mom's room?<eos> You know, I mean, couldn't she have been hiding it for him?
You couldn't be more right, Henry.<eos> How... how'd you know my name?<eos> I never told you.<eos> Let's make it a game, a puzzle to solve.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> You are a lost boy.<eos> You work for Pan.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I am Peter Pan.<eos> But you told Greg and Tamara that magic was bad, that you'd help them destroy it. Why?
A female Lieutenant?<eos> In whose army?<eos> You're not gonna break character, huh?<eos> You've... been emancipated, I take it?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> From enslavement.<eos> Okay, I'll play along here.<eos> I am a black female lieutenant for the Westchester County Police Department.<eos> Do you see this gun?<eos> I'm authorized to use it.
En route to the safe house.<eos> We have the perp in the car.<eos> Okay, turn around... this whole thing's a setup.<eos> Patel, Patel.<eos> No, no, no, no...<eos> Sergeant Patel and two other officers were killed, three MXs were destroyed, and the suspect escaped.<eos> It's about time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Morgue lab is too slow.<eos> Get a lab box, take a sample of his blood, and send it to Rudy for analysis.
Morgue lab is too slow.<eos> Get a lab box, take a sample of his blood, and send it to Rudy for analysis.<eos> Don't need a lab box.<eos> I just downloaded the information.<eos> Rudy should have the data now.<eos> Why him?<eos> Why target Vogel?<eos> Scan every case Vogel was on.<eos> Any connection to biotech, science, medicine, DNA.<eos> I want to see it.
♪ Family Guy 12x01 ♪ Finder Keepers Original Air Date on September 29, 2013<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> We now return to 11 Angry Men and One Developmentally Disabled Man.<eos> Okay, the vote is 11 for "guilty" and one for "kitty."<eos> All right, let's keep talking it out...<eos> Has the jury reached its verdict?<eos> We have, Your Honor. We find the defendant...<eos> kitty.<eos> Boy, am I beat.<eos> Peter, what's with the tie? Oh, I bought a tie so I can loosen it when I'm beat.
You're in hypovolemic shock.<eos> We're going to try to repair the bleeds.<eos> This will help with the pain.<eos> Enough, enough.<eos> We don't want to stop his heart.<eos> Okay, Paco?<eos> I need you to hold something for me.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> And put it right here.
It's been four hours.<eos> Your people haven't made any demands.<eos> I told you Zamani would take the girl.<eos> I told you that's all I knew.<eos> This is in your hands now.<eos> I need your help with Zamani.<eos> How about a trade?<eos> You tell me and I'll tell you.<eos> Tell me about the scar on your palm.<eos> I've noticed how you stroke it.
Hands in the air.<eos> Zamani.<eos> Step down from the ledge.<eos> Hands where I can see 'em or I'll shoot you down!<eos> Tell the General his daughter was... an unfortunate civilian casualty.<eos> He pulled a tracking chip. Son of a bitch.<eos> Did Reddington send you?<eos> I can't understand what you're saying.<eos> Can you stop the bomb?<eos> Can you stop it?
Did Reddington send you?<eos> I can't understand what you're saying.<eos> Can you stop the bomb?<eos> Can you stop it?<eos> - Are we gonna be okay?<eos> - Yeah, baby, we're gonna be okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was scared when I was your age, too.<eos> But I had a secret weapon to keep me safe.<eos> My daddy gave it to me.

He's fascinated by the things.<eos> He certainly has more use for it than we do.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Red vest, gray sweatshirt!<eos> He's got the bomb!<eos> We're gonna make a great team.<eos> Who is the Ukrainian?<eos> - I'm not gonna tell you.<eos> - You gave him a chemical weapon.<eos> He took it.
I think we're finished.<eos> Well, this was fun.<eos> Let's do it again.<eos> Really, let's do it again.<eos> Understand, Zamani was only the first.<eos> The first what?<eos> Name.<eos> On the list.<eos> What list?<eos> It's called The Blacklist.
Mum, Jean's in pain.<eos> Hey, I'm not deaf.<eos> I'm coming, darling.<eos> - He had no sun cream on.<eos> - I forgot.<eos> You could have put some on him.<eos> I don't want to discuss it now.<eos> I keep thinking about it.<eos> Where's the lotion?<eos> You put it in the basket this morning.
Yep.<eos> Michael, are you there? Yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm good.<eos> I don't think Ramon wanted out of his deal.<eos> Can you figure out what he did?<eos> He used the onboard computer as an access point to upload a really nasty worm.<eos> It's corrupted the entire missile control system.<eos> So the missile can't be fired.<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> Who steals a missile to make it useless?
I couldn't help but notice there was one question your friend never asked me.<eos> How did I get so far into the room before he caught me?<eos> Was he sleeping?<eos> Or was he watching TV?<eos> Or was he outside on the street with that case of yours?<eos> I knew you were alone because I saw him leaving the hotel.<eos> There's that mystery solved. Sound familiar?<eos> M.D.K.'s C.F.O.<eos> The military funding of science has led to breakthroughs that have touched the lives of everyone on this planet.<eos> We'd like to remove the burden from the government, and put it to where it belongs, the private sector.
Helen, don't let them control you.<eos> They're not testing on you.<eos> You can do the right thing this time.<eos> It's too late, Nikita.<eos> Helen.<eos> Birkhoff?<eos> Yeah, Nikki, I'm here.<eos> That truck in Pakistan, do you still have control of that missile? Yeah.<eos> Wait, why?<eos> I need you to launch it at M.D.K.
Cheers.<eos> You're toasting the loss of a $14-billion company?<eos> M.D.K. was but one arm of our organization.<eos> An arm that had become infected, was in danger of exposing the body, and had to be cut off.<eos> You know a little something about that.<eos> Easy.<eos> Where are we?<eos> We're safe.<eos> A bubble has now been created for Nikita to believe in.<eos> She will tell her story, and make the rest of the world believe it as well.
A bubble has now been created for Nikita to believe in.<eos> She will tell her story, and make the rest of the world believe it as well.<eos> As long as they remain in that bubble, we'll continue with business as usual.<eos> Nikita's too smart.<eos> Your illusion won't hold.<eos> Yes, it will.<eos> Because she so desperately wants it to.<eos> She's longed for the end of this war for years.<eos> Is it over?<eos> Even when the truth stares her in the face, she'll just close her eyes and will it away.
You know... - What?<eos> - Made her disappear?<eos> - Do you think you're in danger?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Then here. Take this.<eos> You may need it.<eos> You've outdone yourself.<eos> I never thought you'd be stupid enough to slaughter<eos> Chief Inspector of Scotland Yard.<eos> - I wanted the truth and I got it.
I'm catching her in the act.<eos> No, Sheldon, don't.<eos> Aha!<eos> What the hell?<eos> !<eos> Leonard? Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that!<eos> Right.<eos> Penny!<eos> Penny!<eos> Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say "aha" again?
Is that one of those expressions from your generation?<eos> Like the "cat's pajamas" or "grease is the word"? No.<eos> It's an ancient book with a lot of sexual positions.<eos> Well, don't tell me how it ends.<eos> Did you like this evening's opera?<eos> I guess.<eos> Isn't there one where somebody doesn't die? Hmm.<eos> Most of them are tragedies.<eos> No, I mean, in the audience.<eos> Well, opera's not very popular with young people, but Patrick seems to like it.
Absolutely, sir.<eos> Where do we start? What is happening?<eos> We start with him.<eos> Okay. So the perp came in through the window, left the muddy red footprint, and apparently had sex with the dish rack.<eos> Shell casings found here.<eos> Two shots.<eos> Bang, bang. Great work, Detective.<eos> You get a tie.<eos> Hey, that's mine.<eos> You took it from my desk.
I told you I'm fine.<eos> Coach, I swear to you, I did not release that tape.<eos> I don't know who did it, but I am racking my brain trying to figure it out.<eos> - I'm very sor-- Mr. King.<eos> I don't care who you screw on your own time, but that tape was made on my time.<eos> What? That sexcapade was made in your hotel room before the Detroit game, when you were supposed to be alone, correct?<eos> Yes, sir, but --<eos> So my curfew was violated, Mr. King, wasn't it?<eos> That depends on how one interprets the meaning of the word "curfew."<eos> No, it depends on how I interpret it.
I wasn't complaining.<eos> In that case, how about... we lose some more sleep this weekend?<eos> Uh, my mom's in town this weekend, but she really wants to meet you.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Well, you know what they say. There's a little truth in every joke.<eos> Well, not that one. Relax.<eos> Good.<eos> I should get back to my desk. Dani's schedule's jammed today.<eos> Speaking of Dani, uh... the mail room said that she received a package the night Carl died.<eos> Yes, but I don't know who sent it.
Can we please, please have another round?<eos> You still have to get home from White Plains.<eos> I'll hail a cab.<eos> He's such a New Yorker.<eos> This is the agency I always wanted.<eos> Ambition, brains, and beauty.<eos> Yeah, but what about him?<eos> I'm gonna cut you off too, my dear.<eos> I should call home.<eos> If the check comes, I'm sending it to Ocean Spray.
Harry, what did I say about that car?<eos> Well, Cindy, these are my friends Don and Roger.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> There's tacos and booze outside.<eos> If you want a joint, try the candy dish on the coffee table.<eos> Or make a friend.<eos> You look familiar.<eos> You'll have to do better than that.<eos> As you can tell, there's a different protocol.<eos> I look forward to figuring it out.
We're going to need more than Ken in Detroit.<eos> That's music to my ears.<eos> Welcome aboard.<eos> They shouldn't have gone to California.<eos> We're going to bring in Avon.<eos> They gave us Chevy.<eos> Throw in losing Sterling's account, I think we have a lot of good news.<eos> They're not gonna think that.<eos> You're splitting this place and not in half.<eos> We'll give them something to take their mind off it.
- Hey.<eos> Sleep any better last night?<eos> - Not really.<eos> I ended up watching a Scooby-Doo marathon on Cartoon Network.<eos> Well, did the doorbell wake you up?<eos> I didn't hear it.
May I at least see my niece?<eos> She-she's sleeping.<eos> And I don't open the door to strangers after dark.<eos> I'm not a stranger.<eos> I'm your brother-in-law.<eos> Please go away, Mr. Toole.<eos> Don't be coming around here no more.<eos> How bad is it, Mr. Anderson?<eos> Oh, axle's nearly sheared in two.<eos> - Can you repair it? - Yeah.
- You tell me.<eos> - You don't.<eos> Do what I do.<eos> Walk.<eos> Eyes on Scott.<eos> Fellas?<eos> Unarmed.<eos> No gun.<eos> Put your gun down.<eos> Put it down.
- Taking Highway 100.<eos> - I heard.<eos> You were right, what you said before.<eos> About the trail going cold.<eos> I don't need to go out anymore.<eos> Good.<eos> Take it.<eos> Ed gave this to me on our first anniversary.<eos> Please.<eos> I should have given it away a long time ago.
Okay, but in a couple of hours when Henry's dead--<eos> - Glenn.<eos> - How are we gonna get his body down the stairs, across the cell block and through those doors without anyone noticing?<eos> If that happens-- if-- you're gonna help me.<eos> And what if I'm gone?<eos> Shut up and help me get him on this.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're taking Mr. Jacobson to a quieter place.<eos> Go get my copy of "Tom Sawyer" from my room.<eos> I want you to read it by tonight.
What's she gonna be in this world?<eos> She's gonna be alive.<eos> Making mud pies?<eos> Peanut butter sandwiches.<eos> How about a hug before I go?<eos> My hands are muddy.<eos> See?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, I wouldn't want to get my coat dirty.<eos> I messed it all up.

Grenade!<eos> Sasha!<eos> Sasha!<eos> Have you seen Beth?<eos> - Is she on the bus?<eos> We gotta stay down.<eos> Look inside my shirt. Check my back for an exit wound.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's good.<eos> We can treat it.
See, bringing Henry on to Team Schmidt...<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Team Schmidt? Yeah, I'm gonna get hats and shirts made.<eos> Well, Henry is.<eos> We're gonna have a new slogan.<eos> "No bull-Schmidt."<eos> "Schmidt happens."<eos> You're a Schmidt head.<eos> I hired you to be my assistant to help you out financially 'cause you had close your chiropractic office.<eos> I didn't have to close it;
Make sure Bunchy doesn't get into serious trouble.<eos> Why would he get into trouble if it was an accident?<eos> It... It's complicated.<eos> We'll take care of it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> All right.<eos> You're a good man, Terry.<eos> I know you'll do the right thing.<eos> You got the gun? Here.<eos> - Where'd you get it?
Haven't you got enough?<eos> Well, you can never have enough mint sauce, really, can you, with lamb?<eos> Cheers, thanks, Mum.<eos> Cheers.<eos> What the friggin' hell are you doing here?<eos> Me and your dad had an agreement.<eos> We agreed to stay away from each other.<eos> And then someone who looks like me walks into the bank and clears my bank account.<eos> He broke the agreement.<eos> And now I'm breaking it too.
You seemed really upset about the guy killing himself.<eos> I felt bad.<eos> Well, you could have told me.<eos> Thank you very, very much.<eos> So, I'm... I'm thinking that the least that you can do, now, is have a drink with me.<eos> I'm gay.<eos> - You're a lesbian Gypsy?<eos> Rudy?<eos> - Mm? - Why are you wearing the sex bag?<eos> I'm fed up. I've renamed it the bag of eternal shame.

I'm glad that he's dead... because he can't hurt anyone else, ever. - But I will never stop wondering why.<eos> - We know about 70% of serial killers were abused as children, and 60% have brain damage.<eos> But we also know that every society has them.<eos> So tonight, we focus not on why but on how... how we investigate.<eos> What you're about to see is a staged crime scene.<eos> It's what we call a blood cottage.<eos> We will show you how we analyzed the forensic details of the murder of Martin Yeager and his wife, Gail.<eos> When we arrived at the crime scene that you're about to see, Martin Yeager was duct-taped and slaughtered, and his wife, Gail, was missing.<eos> Um, this teacup was one of Hoyt's signatures.<eos> He, uh, would place it on the man's knee and... and use it as a warning device.
Have you ever interviewed a teenage girl?<eos> - Many times.<eos> - And what would you do if that girl... who is... 14, let's say... told you that she had been repeatedly raped<eos> - I'd arrest him. Liar!<eos> You would hide behind the system.<eos> My mother hid behind her perfect home and her respectable husband...<eos> Dr. Appleton, pillar of the community.<eos> Do you know how they explained my son to people?<eos> Oh, I already know the story. Please.<eos> I like hearing it.
I'm also here to finally go through my mom's things.<eos> My mom saved everything.<eos> [Nina] Thankfully, my aunt is here to help decide what to do with it all.<eos> God, I remember these things.<eos> It's sort of all that is left of somebody.<eos> And it's so dreadful. Looking and, you know... I just hate to remember them from things like this, you know.<eos> I have some of her ashes, actually, that I'm gonna to put with mine, when the time comes.<eos> But I needed to do this.<eos> - Dad? - Huh?<eos> I came across this folder and I wanted to show it you and talk to you about it.
- No, I don't want to hear it, okay?<eos> - I didn't say anything. - I already know what you're gonna say.<eos> "Lemon, why are you humiliating yourself for such an archaic organization?"<eos> "Why do you even care what the Belles think?"<eos> "Friends who treat friends like that aren't even friends at all." Maybe.<eos> Or maybe I was just gonna say it's a shame<eos> I never see you sweep the Rammer Jammer.<eos> Also, you missed a spot.<eos> Before I finish, let's talk about that non-compete clause.<eos> You wrote it, so you must know a way around it.
I never see you sweep the Rammer Jammer.<eos> Also, you missed a spot.<eos> Before I finish, let's talk about that non-compete clause.<eos> You wrote it, so you must know a way around it.<eos> What if I only practice on weekends? Or get paid in Euros?<eos> Zoe, are you saying that you're not gonna finish stitching me up unless I tell you how to break the non-compete?<eos> You can't pull off that kind of hardball.<eos> Stupid Hippocratic oath.<eos> Look, the truth is, there is no way around the non-compete.<eos> And I don't think Brick is 100% wrong for wanting to enforce it.
You too.<eos> You're living in a motel?<eos> Yeah, just for now.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Sounds like you have a lot going on.<eos> Maybe I should've checked in a little bit more before I roped you into this again.<eos> No, I wanna go with you guys next summer.<eos> Is the sign-up form in here or should I do it online?<eos> Where did you get the gun?<eos> I found it in my father's desk.

- Hanna, you know I can't. In fact, given your mother's situation, I probably shouldn't be talking to you.<eos> But it's not about Mona. I'm just wondering about Cece.<eos> Cece?<eos> Has she contacted you?<eos> - Or...<eos> - why would Cece contact me? Spencer said that you let her in once before to see Mona, and I was wondering if she thought that you would... do it again.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> It's just the nurse said someone tried to see Mona last night, and when she described a young blonde, I thought it was probably you.<eos> It wasn't.
How about this?<eos> Hi, Mrs. DiLaurentis.<eos> Hi.<eos> How was work?<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine. What are you knitting?<eos> What was going to be a scarf for my husband, but now I guess it'll be a tight sweater for me.<eos> By the way, you can call me Jessica.<eos> The circuit breaker was blown.<eos> Ah, so, I replaced it, and it should start to warm up in here in about 20 minutes.
But I did it to protect her.<eos> From who?<eos> She was calling me that summer to find out.<eos> In the sorority house.<eos> It was you.<eos> She was afraid.<eos> And she was right to be.<eos> What kind of help could you give her?<eos> I have a gift of insight.<eos> I was using it to help Alison see who was threatening her.
Some grains were Middle Eastern and the others were from the Sonoran Desert.<eos> It's a big place. It extends from California to Arizona and into Mexico.<eos> But based on the toxicology results, the water in his system and the minerals in his blood and the pollutants that were in his windpipe...<eos> Uh, trace amounts like that would be so small, you couldn't possibly determine exactly where...<eos> Best guess.<eos> McBride was murdered and beheaded in the Copper State.<eos> Arizona.<eos> Thanks, Abbs.<eos> If Ziva's in trouble, a badge might come in handy.<eos> If you know how to get it to her, I'm game.
- Try 250.<eos> Two fifty?<eos> [LAUGHTER]<eos> Love to tune that supercharged modular.<eos> - Yeah, those are new.<eos> - It's about to get hot in here.<eos> [LAUGHING]<eos> - That is so cool.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Make sure his old lady won't miss that cash, because he's gonna lose it.
- I don't know, let's find out.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - The Camaro's ready to be autopsied?<eos> - I hope it's not an inconvenience.<eos> You know, it just seemed easier to do closer to the Crime Lab.<eos> Are you wearing his fingers?<eos> Uh...<eos> That's remarkable.<eos> I've heard of this technique, but I never thought I'd see it.
You killed a man.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> Well, I killed a rapist and a murderer.<eos> I feel great.<eos> I heard the news about Kate.<eos> - How is she holding up?<eos> - Oh, how do you think?<eos> I mean, she almost got killed, and now the FBI gestapo is treating her like a criminal.<eos> Instead of being there for her, I've got to spoon-feed neuro 101 to a bunch of freshmen.<eos> Look, Daniel, I know how much Kate means to you and I know that she could use your help right now, so whatever time you need, you just take it.
After a stroke, a doctor with no previous interest in art becomes a gifted painter.<eos> Whose work adorns gallery walls and magazine pages.<eos> So if our brains can have a second act... Why not our lives?<eos> Broken lives can be healed.<eos> Justice can finally prevail.<eos> Damaged relationships repaired.<eos> Sins can be forgiven.<eos> Wrongs can be righted.<eos> In our lives, as in our brains, we all deserve... A second chance.<eos> You just have to be brave enough to seize it.
While I admire your willingness to extend an olive branch, I have to tell you, it might not be welcome.<eos> And I'm not sure that Gerard is the one to accept it.<eos> It's true.<eos> The Argents have a matriarchal leadership.<eos> Actually, I was speaking about the fact that he's a complete psychopath.<eos> The man cuts people in half with a broadsword.<eos> Do the two of you really have so little faith in people?<eos> You think Gerard isn't worried about the deaths on his own side?<eos> Do you know the story of the scorpion and the frog?<eos> I have a feeling I'm about to hear it.
Put 'em down now! - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> - Put the guns on the table!<eos> - Baby, don't do this. - Back up!<eos> We got to get out of here.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> Darvy, put the gun down.<eos> Please, baby...<eos> Arcadio, please, you have to...<eos> No!<eos> Drop it, Jax!

You, Mr. Toric, are a risk.<eos> Your... jacket reads like a bad detective novel.<eos> Volatile, recalcitrant.<eos> And the highest arrest record in the history of my field office.<eos> Before we bring these bikers down, I need a public hanging of this local crew.<eos> Yes, a win here will help my career, but dead kids makes this case as personal for me as the murder of your sister is for you.<eos> Understood.<eos> I'll get you that agreement.<eos> You better give county a call.<eos> If Clay Morrow loses his PC, there won't be anyone alive to sign it.
There's things that... that I can't talk about.<eos> If you can't talk about these things, then how can anything ever...<eos> Jesus, woman!<eos> This is who I am!<eos> We're loyal to each other!<eos> If that's a problem, then it's a problem!<eos> It's a problem.<eos> One more thing.<eos> What did you do with the body?<eos> We got rid of it.
Son of a bitch!<eos> - Get him out of my sight!<eos> - You're letting the real perp slip through your fingers, - don't you forget that.<eos> - Stubborn bastard!<eos> Come here.<eos> This is half-assed?<eos> Voice analysis report HAN's voice matches the pay phone recording.<eos> 99.4% chance of match ...swap the bag and throw it over the Northern fence.<eos> You take me for a sucker?<eos> Voiceprint is like fingerprint, you can't fake it no matter how much you doctor it.
You loved Leo. He was human.<eos> Leo was something else.<eos> Then I am in the same place.<eos> Can you not be happy for me?<eos> You could ask first.<eos> We can ask her yourself.<eos> Ask what then?<eos> My father has invited the entire office to the wedding.<eos> Then it becomes something grand. And maybe deductible.<eos> We want a small wedding and I will pay for it.
Dan, please tell me that's not a human being.<eos> What the hell?<eos> - Where's he from?<eos> - I don't know. If he's the real deal, he could be an expeditionary force or he could be some nut job who ransacked an army-surplus store.<eos> We should try and talk to them, let them know we're on the same side.<eos> He's right.<eos> If they were interested in talking, they would've approached us before they attacked us.<eos> Listen, we can't afford to be having this fight right now. Not with the Espheni invasion hanging over our heads.<eos> - I don't like the idea.<eos> - I don't like it, either.
The Loneliest Monk? - Yes.<eos> Mm-hmm. - Yeah?<eos> 'Cause I've heard of the guy called Thelonious Monk. You're not thinking of him?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. That's what I said.<eos> - That's what you said. - Yeah, he's great.<eos> - Sure, sure, sure, sure.<eos> He's great.<eos> You clearly are a jazz aficionado. - My apologies.<eos> - It's here! The limo's here! - Is the limo here?<eos> - Come and see it. - Limo's here!
"She dares say what no one woman has:<eos> "repressed things, angels wrested from entrails."<eos> You're halfway there.<eos> I won't abandon you.<eos> For the fiftieth year, the Goncourts have awarded their annual prize.<eos> The jurors, including Francis Carco, Roland Dorgeiés, Pierre Mac Orlan,<eos> Philippe Hériat and Armand Salacrou, chose The Mandarins by Simone de Beauvoir, who did not appear.<eos> Less shy, Jean Reverzy, winner of the Renaudot, fulfilled the obligations fame brings with it...<eos> That clinic was ever so good.<eos> Mrs de Beauvoir paid for it.
You want these guys dead, don't you?<eos> Hurting people who hurt people.<eos> That's always my endgame.<eos> Tell your boss he has a nice place.<eos> The boy's journal that was found at the crime scene has been analyzed by several psychiatric experts.<eos> I can't go into details about the contents other than to say they were violent and very disturbing.<eos> The journal and other belongings in the boy's locker supported the school's growing concern about the state of Matthew Jennings' mental health.<eos> We know that the diocese made a recommendation over a year ago that the boy seek outside counseling.<eos> Whether that intervention took place is still being determined as we continue our ongoing discussion with the Jennings family.<eos> As far as the weapon goes, we've identified it as an older, pre-1982, KG-9 submachine gun.
Yes.<eos> That's because Connor pitted us against each other.<eos> He created this rivalry, but there's no reason you and I can't be on the same team.<eos> I can think of about 50.<eos> Look, ever since you left, Connor's been trying to kill your company.<eos> He's never gonna forgive you for leaving him. You should know that.<eos> You can't trust him.<eos> And now I'm realizing neither can I.<eos> I have no wife. No kids.<eos> I've sacrificed everything for this company, and I'm not gonna let it go down in flames.
I actually made plans, so I'm not gonna be able to--<eos> Bad joke?<eos> - No, terrible timing.<eos> - Bad timing. Okay.<eos> I need your help with Gianopolous.<eos> Relax, if he's making another run at Hessington Oil, that's not gonna happen.<eos> - Well, how can you know that?<eos> - Because you just restructured, and he can't force another takeover vote for at least six months.<eos> Then why is he driving my stock into the ground?<eos> - What? - He's been dumping it all day.
Well, that's fine, because I just made it my bitch.<eos> Up top, mother flecker!<eos> Whoa, you're gonna leave me hanging?<eos> Like you're gonna leave me hanging?<eos> You got into Harvard, dickhead.<eos> They accepted my transfer?<eos> Yeah, they did.<eos> Holy goddamn shit.<eos> Wait a minute, you read my mail?<eos> What's the point of going through it if I'm not gonna read it?
You and Stephen, it bothers me.<eos> I know it's not fair, but it does.<eos> Good.<eos> What do you mean, good?<eos> I mean, we both knew it.<eos> It's good that you finally were able to say it.<eos> You realize just because it bothers me, it doesn't mean that I want us to be--<eos> I know.<eos> You know this is exactly why I had that policy.<eos> Well, then why did you change it?
You acted alone on this.<eos> I have emails asking for her authorization to make bonus payments.<eos> Those emails didn't mention Swiss bank accounts.<eos> Because I knew you wouldn't want them to.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> It didn't mention Swiss bank accounts because you went to Mariga and arranged everything.<eos> I didn't even know Mariga.<eos> He came to me.<eos> He laid out a bribe.<eos> I accepted it.
"Of all the people guilt-tripping ..." He wants you to take in his father.<eos> Didn't Patrick Sr. threaten to kill Hope when he found out Paddy got her pregnant?<eos> Yes. He did.<eos> And who was Hope pregnant with? Hmm...<eos> [ drums fingers ]<eos> I can't really remem...<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> You, Maura!<eos> The parole is conditional.<eos> They'll revoke it if he doesn't have a place to live by tomorrow.
OK.<eos> What's that?<eos> What does he mean?<eos> This isn't the test I gave you.<eos> I added a question.<eos> In the first person, tell us how a dinosaur feels when he sees the electric fence is off.<eos> There were only goats today again.<eos> I don't even like goats.<eos> I wonder what's outside the fence.<eos> I hear it's freedom, but to get it, you have to die.
How did you know she collapsed?<eos> - Subdermal bleeding on both knees.<eos> - Okay, what do we have?<eos> She adjourned her own courtroom at 5:00, and she checked in students when they arrived here at 5:10.<eos> Left at 5:25, didn't come back until after the competition started.<eos> - Where did she go?<eos> - Nobody knows.<eos> - But she left her briefcase here.<eos> - Okay, let's have CSRU collect that.<eos> - We'll go through it later.
Again with the testing.<eos> You know, you could be one of the most impatient<eos> - human beings I know.<eos> - But you're not sure?<eos> Maybe you should test it.<eos> - You're wrecking my appetite.<eos> Maybe that's the insoluble gluten mass that you ordered?<eos> [RATTLING]<eos> Got your mail.<eos> Oh, thanks, Tommy. Do you mind putting it on the desk?
Of course you did!<eos> I was trying to start her heart.<eos> - She was my friend.<eos> - And you made sure you touched her<eos> - in case you were ever a suspect.<eos> - That's not true!<eos> No? Since when did CPR require a syringe filled with ritalin?<eos> What syringe?<eos> Oh, the supposed murder weapon?<eos> Do you have that? Did you... did you recover it when
- She was my friend.<eos> - And you made sure you touched her<eos> - in case you were ever a suspect.<eos> - That's not true!<eos> No? Since when did CPR require a syringe filled with ritalin?<eos> What syringe?<eos> Oh, the supposed murder weapon?<eos> Do you have that? Did you... did you recover it when<eos> - you tore apart my house?<eos> - I'm sure you disposed of it.
Now, a lot of great fighters will get up and fight through that, but me, this last time, I was down and out.<eos> It took me a couple of months to recover.<eos> Well, it's understandable that you would be glove-shy after something like that.<eos> Yeah, well, I've been hit thousands of times, maybe even a million.<eos> But...<eos> You see, it only takes one punch or a good punch or a lucky punch or even a sucker punch.<eos> It just takes one.<eos> And then you're a dead man.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, being knocked out is a traumatizing event, so we need to break down the experience, normalize it, and remove the fear.
Asshole!<eos> So... "Operation Edelweiss"!<eos> A counterterrorism exercise.<eos> Not some exercise, but apparently the most difficult.<eos> No company has succeeded for ten years.<eos> So we have no chance.<eos> Battalion, attention!<eos> The survival of this battalion will depend on each one of you.<eos> Now you can prove what you fusiliers are capable of.<eos> We have no chance, so we must seize it.
You think so?<eos> You'll lose again anyway.<eos> "Again"?<eos> Like every year.<eos> How often would we have been blown up because no one finds the bomb?<eos> Where is the bomb?<eos> Stijssi, not again!<eos> Can I help you?<eos> We've got to find the bomb!<eos> - Have you got it?
Well, it was really nice meeting you.<eos> You're gonna fit in just fine around here.<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.<eos> So you gonna train him?<eos> Stormy?<eos> I don't think you can train a mule.<eos> Well you can't, but you can outsmart him.<eos> Outsmart him?<eos> My back screen door squeaks.<eos> Every time, I open it, cats come running.
You wound me.<eos> And if I can't deliver?<eos> I wind up like the last mayor?<eos> With one big difference.<eos> She died quick and painlessly.<eos> Either you or someone you know has been a victim of a flagrant violation of their privacy.<eos> Emails you one thought were confidential were suddenly accessible to anyone.<eos> But, my friends, this wanton assault on your freedom is merely a wake-up call.<eos> You see, your privacy was never there to begin with.<eos> I know it feels like you have lost control, but you never had it.
They arrest you?<eos> They certainly tried.<eos> You?<eos> Questioning.<eos> It's not a good day to be a politician.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Look, you and I don't row on the same waters.<eos> Sure we do.<eos> We know how to build a following, and we both know how to use it.
I mean, I love you.<eos> Got to go. Bye.<eos> We made it.<eos> Remind me to put a five-dollar bill in Barney's wedding card, you know, to get 'em started.<eos> No, Elizabeth.<eos> Leave the dentures in.<eos> I never want to have sex again.<eos> They broke our $600 bottle of scotch?<eos> Well, I'm not wearing this abomination anymore.<eos> Put it back on.
We're here for you.<eos> Hey, sorry we're late.<eos> We made a kale-dandelion salad.<eos> And I made the dressing from milk I got from my goat.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> I hope there's enough for just the two of ya.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Canvas, this is Ed.<eos> Where's this goat?<eos> If we're gonna eat it, I'd better get to the killin' and skinning'.
He's being put on a desk.<eos> Not your concern.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Hey, we gotta talk.<eos> If you wanna thank me for saving your life, now we're even.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, yes, thank you.<eos> But that's not...<eos> You wanna give me my watch back?<eos> It's my dad's watch and you can tell me how you got it later.
Stay where you are.<eos> All these years I thought you were dead, Sadler.<eos> Make any sudden moves and you will be.<eos> Step away from the device.<eos> You want to protect the time line?<eos> Send me home.<eos> I can prevent Liber8 from ever coming to 2077,<eos> I can make sure none of this ever happens!<eos> I can make things right.<eos> And I'm able to destroy the device and no one will ever use it again.
What do you want from me, Edward?<eos> I want you to put aside your anger and figure out a way to help.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to put aside my anger.<eos> We're in the middle of a murder trial.<eos> We can spare five minutes for this.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> I gave you that bottle when you took over from Daniel.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I told you to only open it in case of an emergency.
We're not the only people that are like family to each other.<eos> And sometimes you have to put your family in a position where they don't have a choice.<eos> What do you need me to do?<eos> New plan-we're gonna convince Cameron that Ava's innocent.<eos> Have you been drinking?<eos> Yeah. Why?<eos> Because wasn't that the old plan?<eos> That was the old goal.<eos> This time, it's you who's going to Cameron.<eos> If he won't hear the truth from you, how's he gonna hear it from me?
I came from nothing. Did you know that?<eos> There is nothing in my heritage, my people, where they came from, their place in the world, to give me even the slightest leg up on what is to be my destiny.<eos> The school of hard knocks was my teacher. And do you know what I learned?<eos> If Mr. Bohannon finds out that<eos> - That a man who is encumbered by what's right and what's wrong will never achieve anything.<eos> Are you listening to me?<eos> I am not encumbered by what encumbers most men because I am not most men.<eos> I thought I saw the same potential in you.<eos> If I was mistaken... you'll have no one to blame but yourself.<eos> I will remind you, Miss Ellison, that you are under a moral obligation to tell the truth, as you know it, for the benefit of these proceedings.
I don't expect men like these, who bought themselves out of the draft, to understand what I'm talking about, general, but I reckon you do.<eos> Killing ain't something anyone is born to.<eos> It's something we learn.<eos> And you're the one who has to live with it when it's done.<eos> I done a lot of killing, both during and after the war.<eos> Mr. Durant and Senator Metcalf here, they'll call me a murderer as it suits them.<eos> But no matter what they call it, it won't bring back those men, or my family.<eos> Damn sure won't change who I am.<eos> You're refusing to sign the statement?<eos> I won't sign it because it ain't true.
I have never been better.<eos> The good stuff.<eos> No, from underneath the bar.<eos> Yes, sir, boss man, sir.<eos> Ain't nobody's boss no more, Mickey.<eos> - Durant is.<eos> - They fired you?<eos> I quit.<eos> What about the railroad?<eos> Durant will finish it.
The good stuff.<eos> No, from underneath the bar.<eos> Yes, sir, boss man, sir.<eos> Ain't nobody's boss no more, Mickey.<eos> - Durant is.<eos> - They fired you?<eos> I quit.<eos> What about the railroad?<eos> Durant will finish it.<eos> Shit, he started it.
Mm-hmm.<eos> On account of the men who died by my orders. 300,000 in all.<eos> Men, fathers, sons, brothers.<eos> Thanks to me.<eos> Of course, those who gave me that moniker also thanked me, publicly and privately, for winning their ugly war, and keeping them out of it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> What I wouldn't give to be this close to you three years ago with a griswold in my hand.<eos> That pistol was one damn unreliable piece.<eos> Always worked when I needed it.
Our personal enmity aside, Bohannon, my offer of the reward is sincere.<eos> If the child is found, I will make good on the gold.<eos> Mr. Bohannon, come quick. It's, um... it's about the baby.<eos> This here's railroad property, Durant.<eos> You come back, I'll have you arrested for trespassing.<eos> Don't be surprised if someday soon, I return the favor.<eos> He... he knows.<eos> He as much as said so.<eos> Sean, if he knew, you would have a hole in your head right there.<eos> Find your manhood and embrace it.
So, of all the people in New Orleans, you choose someone with a master's in psychology to record your life story.<eos> You're over a thousand years old. Pretty damn sure you know how to type.<eos> The truth is, you compel me to come here because you have no one else to talk to, and you want to be understood.<eos> Then you compel me to forget everything as soon as I leave your presence because you're too scared to trust.<eos> I am scared of nothing.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's an ancient, mystical plot I'm using to destroy you.<eos> Relax. It's a tattoo design.<eos> Draw on your own time.<eos> This is my time. You steal it from me.
I cannot be killed.<eos> Eternity is an awfully long time.<eos> How long to you think Marcel will stay in power?<eos> What if one of you lot were to release me, knowing I would be eternally in your debt?<eos> I would pity those of you who dared to cross me.<eos> I can assure you your ends would be spectacular.<eos> To borrow a trick from an old friend...<eos> Whoever picks up this coin gets to live.<eos> Now, which of you magnificent bastards wants to join me?<eos> Anyone wants that coin, pledge allegiance to Klaus. Take it now.
And I water'd it in fears, night and morning with my tears.<eos> And I sunned it with smiles,<eos> and with soft deceitful wiles.<eos> And it grew both day and night' till it bore an apple bright.<eos> And my foe beheld it shine, and he knew that it was mine.<eos> And into my garden stole, when the night had veiled the pole.<eos> In the morning glad I see my foe outstretch 'd beneath the tree.<eos> Good morning.<eos> HEY-<eos> Listen. I know I'm the only one in this house that actually drinks milk, but would it kill any of you to make sure it's on the grocery list?
In precisely 3 minutes time, your little hunting party will become the prey.<eos> Now, based on your recent failure to subdue my baby brother Niklaus, this despite a better that 100:1 advantage,<eos> I recommend you heed my warning.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Well, I thought the situation demanded something a little dramatic.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> I would say the better question, is who are you?<eos> To a united front.<eos> This act of yours, the imitation of friendship... don't get me wrong. You play the part well enough.<eos> I should know, having played it myself, but there was a time when the affinity between us was quite real.
Well, I have reason, too, little wolf.<eos> If the werewolves are dead, then the vampires have less desire to kill you.<eos> I am trying to keep you safe, not that you appreciate the effort.<eos> And as soon as I have this baby, what happens to me then?<eos> Right.<eos> Well, lucky for me, I have a little while before I find out, and in the meantime, I will find a way to pay you back for this.<eos> As long as I'm in the family way, well, you can't do a damn thing about it.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> My violin.<eos> I must've left it in the attic.
It just takes time to develop a team that you trust.<eos> I guess I'll find out if my instincts apply to people or just to candy.<eos> Okay, now that's too much. See?<eos> Was that hard?<eos> No.<eos> I loved it.<eos> So if I love bossing you around, why am I so anxious?<eos> Well, maybe you're apprehensive about sharing your space.<eos> My kitchen? Huh.<eos> I love it, but I'm not that particular about my space. Are you?
He went there to rescue me.<eos> And by the time I managed to climb inside, he was gone.<eos> But I saw you.<eos> Running away into the night.<eos> You didn't save him.<eos> You were too busy... Fighting a meaningless duel with Malcolm Merlyn.<eos> And when people-- people you told me you would protect needed your help...<eos> You weren't there.<eos> I don't think you wear that hood because you're a hero.<eos> I think you wear it to hide that you're a coward, and I promise you, I will see you unmasked, prosecuted and sent to prison.
Ugh!<eos> Sorry, Steven.<eos> We'll get these centipeetles out of your room.<eos> We think they were trying to get into the temple.<eos> You don't have to get rid of them.<eos> They are really cool!<eos> Um, you guys?<eos> These things don't have gems.<eos> That means there must be a mother somewhere nearby.<eos> We should probably find it before anyone gets hurt.
So now we get to the heart of the matter--<eos> You're in love with her.<eos> She betrayed me in a way you couldn't even imagine.<eos> Or maybe you can...<eos> As I'm sure David Clarke's treachery lit a fire inside you.<eos> Do not make inferences to my past, nor try to compel me by straining to link David with whatever Emily is up to.<eos> Don't be so sure.<eos> Once upon a time...<eos> David Clarke attempted to destroy your livelihood.<eos> And now you've lost it - at the hands of Emily and Nolan Ross.
- Charlotte--<eos> Patrick, if I were you, I'd get out before it's too late.<eos> Hey.<eos> I still can't believe my mother chose to trot Patrick out yesterday.<eos> Well, I'm sure she had her reasons.<eos> Why do I even care?<eos> My parents are rotten human beings who continually disappoint me.<eos> And yet I have this innate need to protect them.<eos> Because despite everything, they're your family.<eos> And when someone comes along and threatens that bond, you'll do anything to defend it.
Over 80,000 views and counting.<eos> That will help get you started.<eos> Would you like to order something?<eos> Well, sure.<eos> We might as well look at the dessert menu.<eos> Right, guys?<eos> Don't you judge me, Brutus?<eos> Can you at least give us a cell phone number so we can call him?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> He changed it.
At a gathering, they tested him.<eos> Stones, arrows, and flame were all hurled at him.<eos> Nothing worked.<eos> But there was one God who wasn't so enamored of Baldur.<eos> The God of mischief, loki.<eos> Loki discovered that Frigg had forgotten to ask mistletoe, a tiny, seemingly harmless plant.<eos> And completely overlooked.<eos> Loki fashioned a dart out of mistletoe, and it killed Baldur.<eos> Frigg was heartbroken.<eos> She decreed that mistletoe would never again be used as a weapon and that she would place a kiss on anyone who passed under it.
I spoke with my colleagues and they agreed we should all sit down again.<eos> If you could meet us at the Mayfield at 9:30, that should give us enough time before our flight.<eos> We'll meet you in the east dining room.<eos> Yes, yes!<eos> If I leave now, I can still make it.<eos> And what about your wife?<eos> I'll call her on the way.<eos> Mr. Kruger, wait.<eos> The message, it's not labeled as "New".<eos> Someone else must have listened to it first.
Yes, yes!<eos> If I leave now, I can still make it.<eos> And what about your wife?<eos> I'll call her on the way.<eos> Mr. Kruger, wait.<eos> The message, it's not labeled as "New".<eos> Someone else must have listened to it first.<eos> Who?<eos> Sommers!<eos> And if he's listened to it, he'll be waiting for you at the hotel.
Let me guess.<eos> They're suing you for groping them while you had them under anesthesia.<eos> Oh, it's completely ridiculous.<eos> They were totally knocked out.<eos> How could they possibly remember anything?<eos> Don't worry, Nelson.<eos> I will bail you guys out.<eos> I just need your debit card and pin number because I'm broke.<eos> Great idea, Wood.<eos> I'll just get it from my wallet.
You sure that's the only reason?<eos> Maybe what you're really worried about is if I leave, I might never come back.<eos> No, no. I...<eos> I...<eos> I'm worried about your safety.<eos> This is the best place for you.<eos> I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.<eos> You always felt more comfortable behind a mask.<eos> You were the only one who could ever see past it, past the mask of the monster.<eos> Then why put it back on now?
Don't lie to me!<eos> Magic has led me to this rathole of a town!<eos> His trail ends here, in Hamelin.<eos> I know you're hiding him from me.<eos> No.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> Many of our children went missing last night, lured from their beds by some unholy music.<eos> What kind of music?<eos> From the Piper.<eos> Only the children could hear it.
Give me the spear.<eos> A squid?<eos> That's right.<eos> I believe you know how to extract ink from one of these bad boys.<eos> Squid ink.<eos> So this is your plan?<eos> It can immobilize the most magical of creatures.<eos> Even Pan.<eos> I have some experience with it.<eos> Can you get it out?
Good for you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> It's lonely in Neverland.<eos> The only friends I have are the children who visit in their dreams.<eos> But they can't stay.<eos> The boys I take back with will.<eos> You're here for my son.<eos> I am.<eos> It's gonna take a lot more than a magic pipe to take my son.<eos> The only thing magic about this pipe is that only certain boys can hear it... boys who feel unloved, boys who feel lost.

Isn't it?
You can't go into the jungle alone.<eos> Without my power to protect you, Pan will capture you both!<eos> I'm sorry, I got no choice.<eos> We're safer without you.<eos> Good-bye, papa.<eos> How can you be so sure it's a map?<eos> There was a short time in Neverland when Baelfire was aboard my ship.<eos> I taught him to navigate using the stars.<eos> What you're looking at is the fruit of my labors.<eos> Then you can read it.
What you're looking at is the fruit of my labors.<eos> Then you can read it.<eos> Sadly, no.<eos> I thought you just said you taught him how.<eos> Yes, but I also taught Neal something else.<eos> The key to being a pirate... secrecy.<eos> The best captains conceal their maps in a code.<eos> He was an apt pupil.<eos> So you're saying the only person who can read this map is Neal?<eos> Which means the only person who can read it is dead.
What part won't I believe?<eos> Okay. The part that I don't.<eos> I traced the blocked numbers to a mainframe owned by a series of dummy corps.<eos> One buffer after another till I hit an actual, legitimate company called Gran Castillo.<eos> It's a real estate company.<eos> Mendez.<eos> And get this-- the short-range detonators used in both bombings, transmits using a phone signal.<eos> Mendez's phone.<eos> Call he got at the hospital was him triggering the bomb.<eos> Could be the only reason he's part of that anti-terror group is to stop guys from Walters from trying to support it.
No, no, we're not going to Malibu.<eos> I just want to go to this bowling party, you know? - Check in with Marion.<eos> - I'm not going bowling.<eos> We've been chasing this girl all over the city.<eos> I'm not going to Malibu just 'cause you're hung up on some bimbo.<eos> All right, she's not a bimbo, okay?<eos> And what are we gonna do? We're gonna go to a bowling alley so you can stand around near Marion in the hope that she'll magically take you back?<eos> I mean, she's asked for a divorce, Wade.<eos> What, so you just want me to give up on my marriage?<eos> It's not giving up, man. You've been trying for months.
They wanted me to move into town with them after Gerry died.<eos> You can have our old room.<eos> I'll set up in Mother and Father's.<eos> Needs painting.<eos> Well, add it 10 your chores.<eos> Some curtains, maybe.<eos> And a hobbyhorse.<eos> Make it a proper nursery.<eos> The crib's stored out in the barn.<eos> I'd fetch it myself, but...
It's even better than a locator spell.<eos> Thank you for working so quickly, Nadia.<eos> I'm not ready to hand her over yet.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> Your fascinating unfinished business I don't care about.<eos> Get out of my head.<eos> What are you two talking about?<eos> Let go of her arm.<eos> Now I want you to pull out your gun...<eos> And aim it at your heart.
Well...<eos> No.<eos> But it worked a bit.<eos> Was it good when it worked a bit?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes it was good.<eos> My dad was cursed at the end of his life.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> He unearthed a holy relic no one should have found.<eos> He sold it secretly to a collector friend.
She's taking them on a tour of the mountain.<eos> There's a special Grail tour.<eos> We take them to the Crusaders' Rock and tell them the legend.<eos> Aren't they literature students?<eos> Archaeology.<eos> She's not showing them the cave?<eos> No.<eos> Dad hasn't even taken us to the cave.<eos> We don't know where it is.<eos> It only appears to pure hearts anyway.
Ruthie's older, so she thinks she's the boss.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - But for a little guy, Stu holds his own.<eos> They can be a handful.<eos> But, God, they make me laugh so hard, you know?<eos> Wow. I did not know you could even tell the gender of a turtle.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It's called "sexing the turtle," and it's an eight-step process.<eos> Now, let's pretend your hand is a turtle.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - What you do is you flip it over.
Joanna.<eos> Wendy!<eos> - What are you doing in here?<eos> - Sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> - What...<eos> I thought if I recreated your dream, then inspiration would strike.<eos> Well... you scared the crap out of me.<eos> So, I made a list of your enemies, and the list is really, really long, and I still need your help to finish it.
Can't find my badge and I.D. Ooh.<eos> Lost your creds-- that's serious.<eos> Yeah, I know, Tony.<eos> I couldn't find them at home; I was hoping I'd left them here.<eos> Ooh, you're so screwed.<eos> Thank God I didn't lose my building access card.<eos> Lost creds initiate an automatic I.G. 2B investigation.<eos> It's almost as serious as losing your weapon.<eos> You didn't lose that, too, did you?<eos> You keep talking and I'll use it.
With the right software, you could hack into any system in the world.<eos> They won't be able to stop you.<eos> It's one equation.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> Encryption consists of setting up problems so complicated that a computer can't solve them.<eos> Solving P versus NP lets you run through the possible answer fast enough to crack the code.<eos> I mean, you could come and go as you please through any server on the planet.<eos> It's a skeleton key.<eos> It's the key to building the skeleton key.<eos> I mean, once you had the solution, you'd still need to write the code to apply it.
Instead of facing up to them, she's running away from them.<eos> She's losing herself in her work, and maybe even worse.<eos> She's my daughter, I just want her safe, I want to protect her.<eos> But I guess like we say in our meetings, more will be revealed.<eos> Your days of screaming are just beginning.<eos> Sarah?<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> This ain't the police station.<eos> Why are you wearing that mask?<eos> This city is in chains, and I'm going to free it.
Yeah, I also told him if you didn't kill the story, I'll call all the investors I acquired and advise them to pull out.<eos> I assume that's French for "thank you." You're welcome.<eos> Listen, you said to me that you've been pushed around by men your whole life?<eos> Well, I've been pushed around by women, so I get it.<eos> We both have something to prove.<eos> But I wouldn't have gone over your head<eos> - if this wasn't for the best.<eos> - For you, you mean?<eos> Considering the measures you took to deter me, you've only proven there is a story to tell.<eos> And rest assured, I will tell it.
You're not the only one concerned why Aiden's back.<eos> The night of my dad's election, I came here for you<eos> - and found him waiting. - What?<eos> I knew there was more to your relationship.<eos> Otherwise, why would he have been here asking me to call off the engagement?<eos> Because I told you, he was obsessed.<eos> Really?<eos> That night, when he attacked me, he threw me into this.<eos> Another reason why you should have an alarm system--<eos> If you're gonna leave your gun where anyone can get their hands on it.
Sorry to interrupt your meeting, but I needed to see you.<eos> Um, can we talk about the accident for a second?<eos> Oh, perfect timing then.<eos> This is Detective March.<eos> He'll be handling the investigation.<eos> - Emily Thorne.<eos> - Oh. - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> That's funny, because I was the first on the scene, - and no one's taken my statement.<eos> - I already gave it to him.
Emily...<eos> He's killed my brother.<eos> All I ever wanted is to find a way to make him pay for something.<eos> Anything...<eos> Look, Jack, I need you to stay out of this.<eos> Hey, it's Jack.<eos> I need some info.<eos> "And Daniel Grayson has always risen above adversity "to embrace new challenges.<eos> "Following a drunk driving accident, "which nearly killed his passenger, "he saw it as a wake-up call,<eos> "joining then rising through the ranks of his father's company, eventually running it."
Name's Ariel.<eos> Once Upon a Time 3x06<eos> - Ariel Original air date November 3, 2013<eos> Focus.<eos> Concentrate.<eos> It's kind of hard when you're talking in my ear.<eos> And when the wind blows or it's raining, or... someone's shooting arrows at you.<eos> Yes, concentration's hard.<eos> That's the point.<eos> Find your anger and use it to focus.
Our own family.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> Don't you?<eos> No, you... you can't want anything.<eos> You're just a figment of my self-conscious.<eos> No. No.<eos> I'm really here.<eos> Take my hand.<eos> Believe in our love, and we can go back.<eos> Take it, rumple.
There is only one way to find out.<eos> Go!<eos> Thank you, Snow!<eos> Go! Just go!<eos> Your Highness... It's time.<eos> Just a little longer.<eos> I told you there'd be no second chances.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> Your voice.<eos> I took it.
Merlyn?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Just a warrior.<eos> Like you.<eos> Why are you dressed like Malcolm Merlyn? Huh?<eos> Who sent you? !<eos> ♪ Arrow 2x05 ♪ League of Assassins Original Air Date on November 6, 2013<eos> Subtitles by Russell W. Behne San Jose City, Philippines<eos> I remember the first time I saw this hood.<eos> Shado was wearing it.
I've worked hard to try and stop these bludgers and criminals from living off the earnings of these unfortunate women.<eos> Do you really think that I would frequent places like that?<eos> You ordered a raid there six months ago, along with raids on two other high end brothels.<eos> A man was shot, wasn't he?<eos> It was an armed raid.<eos> These things happen.<eos> Clearly I have been set up by someone.<eos> That's what you get when you ruffle feathers.<eos> Mrs Blunt said the library door was locked when she came back to the house.<eos> Well, obviously someone locked it when they left.
It's not often I get invited out to hear an apology.<eos> I'm so sorry I snapped at you.<eos> I got defensive, and when I went away to think about it,<eos> I came up with why. Why?<eos> I feel like a guest in your apartment.<eos> And I think it's because we spend all of our time at your place and none of the time at mine.<eos> Yeah, but I told you, when I'm at your place, all I can picture is Tess in a bedsheet.<eos> I know.<eos> Come on, I want to show you something.<eos> Louis, we gave you one job, and you blew it.
The Whooping Crane of Manchuria.<eos> - It's my calming animal.<eos> - You've chosen well.<eos> What can I do for you, Katrina?<eos> - I never heard back from you.<eos> - About what?<eos> About anything...<eos> Especially what we're going to do about negotiations.<eos> There's no more negotiation.<eos> I had one assignment, and I blew it.
The boy's got some balls.<eos> - He kicked my ass.<eos> Didn't even have the courtesy to give me a--<eos> - Robert!<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> She's gonna be a lawyer.<eos> Gonna hear a lot worse.<eos> Dad, what are you talking about--what happened?<eos> He wanted an advance on the Folsom settlement.<eos> And he put the screws to me to get it.
See you got my affidavit.<eos> Well written, wouldn't you say?<eos> So is Lord of the Rings, but you know what they both are?<eos> Fiction.<eos> What did Tanner offer you to sign that?<eos> He didn't offer me anything.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Tanner's a liar and a snake and he doesn't do anything without a reason.<eos> So you say, but I wouldn't know him from a hole in the ground.<eos> He came to me with an opportunity, and I took it.
How do we find him?<eos> He's at the lookout.<eos> He's waiting for me.<eos> I can feel him, Nathan.<eos> It's the connection.<eos> It keeps getting stronger every minute.<eos> People from other worlds going in and out of some door Willy-Nilly.<eos> Well, it's what I've been saying all along.<eos> The door is dangerous.<eos> I mean, look what happened the last time we opened it.
We're all here.<eos> I don't know why it isn't telling me what to do.<eos> Hey, what do you think we should do?<eos> We need to get Audrey, Dave, and William on the figures.<eos> No...<eos> You don't need to do this.<eos> This... this is...<eos> Let's go.<eos> Stop squirming.<eos> As soon as we get William through that door, we'll close it and let you go.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Jessica is a fabulous actress. She is on a short list for a starring role on "NCIS: L.A."<eos> Well, it's just a stupid cop show.<eos> I probably won't even get it.<eos> I'm actually moving away from acting and focusing more on my own writing.<eos> What are you working on?<eos> I'm currently finishing up a web series about one woman's descent into madness.<eos> Ah, what's it called?<eos> "Descent into Madness."<eos> Well, good luck with it. I'll check it out when it's up.
there you go.<eos> Good. Good face, yeah.<eos> Good face.<eos> You're too tall to dance with a human woman.<eos> That is why I aim for supermodels.<eos> Although you do have a nice concave chest for me to rest my head on.<eos> There he goes.<eos> You got it.<eos> You got the fucking part.<eos> - I got it?
And they've left me, yes!<eos> We could telephone Mr Butler and have him come down by train. And I'm very happy to make myself useful.<eos> The burglary, too.<eos> Kip. What burglary?<eos> Sergeant.<eos> Sergeant, why won't you take my word for it?<eos> You're not outback now, Mr McNaster.<eos> We have rules.<eos> That coin was handed in, so unless you can prove ownership...<eos> How can I prove anything if you won't let me see it?
This is an impeccably maintained rally racer.<eos> Wheels don't simply fall off.<eos> Depends how recklessly you drive the car.<eos> Look at this. Look at her scarf.<eos> If Gerty had been driving along with this scarf through the door, it would be filthy.<eos> Look at it.<eos> It's spotless.<eos> If she was driving at speed, the scarf would fly out behind her.<eos> Why are you not willing to entertain the idea of foul play?<eos> Why ask my opinion if you're not willing to listen to it?
But bravo, Miss Fisher.<eos> We make a wonderful team.<eos> I'm quite cosy enough, thank you.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Evening edition.<eos> Bloody awful, what happened to Louisa.<eos> She was a real gem.<eos> Tell Clarence his paper's here.<eos> He needs it for his racing show.
That doesn't mean that's the way things have to stay.<eos> Special delivery - Louisa's last meal.<eos> Thank you, Jack.<eos> I think I'm going to miss Archie Jones.<eos> Did you choose that name yourself?<eos> It did suit your gold tie. Just look at page 5.<eos> Bereavements. A lost Pomeranian in Elwood.<eos> What made this page so special to Louisa?<eos> Collins suggested Miss Williams might have more luck. Really?<eos> I'll give it to her immediately.
Phryne?<eos> It's alright, Jack.<eos> Valma is obviously an excellent markswoman or she would have killed me by now.<eos> And she would have shot you in the head instead of just shooting off your hat.<eos> Everyone, back inside!<eos> Valma, I will give myself up. CLEM:<eos> You heard the Doc, Val.<eos> (Gun cocks) Let her go.<eos> My gun, Valma.<eos> Put it down, Val.
Why are you asking that?<eos> André's son says lovers lick each other's ears.<eos> He should fall in love, then he can talk about it.<eos> Good night, Sebastian.<eos> Has anyone seen it kill sheep?<eos> - Who?<eos> - The beast.<eos> Didn't César show you the dead sheep?<eos> Yes, but he never saw it attack.<eos> If he had, he wouldn't have missed it.
What are you doing here?<eos> Don't I stink like a goat?<eos> Don't stand there. You'll get hurt.<eos> But I want to help you.<eos> You want to help?<eos> Get that stick back there.<eos> Hurry UP!<eos> Is it true you know the man who beat the beast?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why did he beat it?
It's the body fighting off disease.<eos> And if it's not a good fever?<eos> It can be an infection, of a wound, for example.<eos> So?<eos> What do you do, for example, if there's an infestation?<eos> Well, if it's an infection, you give a shot...<eos> Why are you asking?<eos> I don't know. Just asking.<eos> And then?<eos> You disinfect the wound, stitch it up if it's deep.
I know you, Laskey.<eos> Just like I know Jerry back there is a lieutenant in Bronx Vice who paid for this bar with dirty cash from shaking down hookers.<eos> And I have the proof to put him away for it.<eos> Now I was gonna wait and arrest you two with everyone else.<eos> But if this is how you wanna play it, little man, guess I'll have to take you down right now.<eos> You both can go easy...<eos> or it can be hard.<eos> They should've killed you, you stupid bit--<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> Put it down!
You just have to listen.<eos> Bye, Shaw.<eos> You're hurting me.<eos> So I, uh, disobeyed some...<eos> Pretty much all... of your orders.<eos> Am I fired?<eos> On the contrary, Ms. Shaw.<eos> I think you finally got the job.<eos> Now about that bug in my library...<eos> Haven't found it yet, have you?
I like the balls you guys use.<eos> When you play rugby.<eos> Dude, do you mind?<eos> You'll have to forgive my friend.<eos> He doesn't know any better.<eos> You're looking at my junk too.<eos> Can you pass the soap?<eos> Sure.<eos> There you go.<eos> Oh, I dropped it.

A lot of deleted scenes.<eos> We shot so much this season and couldn't put it all in the show.<eos> We also have commentary where we sit around and we drink a lot of beers and have some pizza and just dish about what happened during the shoot.<eos> That's pretty cool.<eos> We have a car passing by so the sound is going to probably be a little bad here.

Hi, Hope.<eos> Young-seek is the problem.<eos> What are you grumbling?<eos> Try this.<eos> I don't get this at all.<eos> Get what?<eos> It's a math question.<eos> I can solve most questions. But I have no clue with this.<eos> How can a Grade 2 math question be so hard?<eos> Read it again.
It was bizarre.<eos> Really bizarre.<eos> Dr. Vega, it was like she was sleepwalking.<eos> Her mind was elsewhere.<eos> And her eyes, they were glazed over white.<eos> Glazed white?<eos> Maybe she was prescribing herself some recreational drug.<eos> It didn't look like anything I've ever seen.<eos> All the color was gone.<eos> Medic, I'd like to see the body before you remove it.
And then I received a text message.<eos> It said she wouldn't be reached for a while.<eos> Could...<eos> Could I... see that message?<eos> The text?<eos> Here.<eos> She flirts and hooks up with other men, if I don't keep an eye on her.<eos> She even changed her lock, and used my credit card like crazy.<eos> Credit card?<eos> I gave it to her for emergency.
You hear me?<eos> I hear you, we'll leave, you can live here.<eos> Just let my family leave, and it's all yours.<eos> Don't lie!<eos> I'm gonna burn everything!<eos> No, don't!<eos> Don't...<eos> Let my family walk out.<eos> I'm not lying to you.<eos> This home, you can have it, we'll... we'll leave peacefully.
I did.<eos> I wanna find out how much they'll sacrifice their dignity to get something that they really want.<eos> I see, my little field mouse.<eos> Do you like magic?<eos> Card magic?<eos> Doesn't every woman love card magic?<eos> I'm actually quite good.<eos> - I trained under the Great Couchelle.<eos> Here, sign your name on this card.<eos> And then I'm going to fold it with one hand.

I've been thinking this over, Metatron.<eos> I will join you as second in command.<eos> Bravo, Gadreel.<eos> This move will erase the mark that has hounded you through the centuries.<eos> Heaven will be restored, as will your reputation as one of its greatest heroes.<eos> I thank you for this opportunity.<eos> There is just one more thing.<eos> Yes.<eos> I need to be sure of your fidelity.<eos> You have it.
I'm sorry, but you need to leave before he arrives.<eos> I have believed in you from the start, Mr. Mahir.<eos> Okay, tomorrow at dawn, I will come to get Ela.<eos> I will pray that the dawn doesn't come so soon.<eos> You've changed my daughter into a proper lady.<eos> You've changed her into a proper lady.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> You have to know the meaning of words, Ela.<eos> If you don't know it, you can't escape the dark. You will not be able to reach the light, my dear.
Dorante is aware of the gravity of his commitment and hopes that his temporary disguise will allow him to know your dear daughter better.<eos> Please note that photography is not permitted with or without flash.<eos> For the benefit of the performance, please also switch off your mobile phones. Thank you.<eos> Just Love!<eos> Freely adapted from<eos> Marivaux's Game of Love and Chance<eos> Why are you speaking on my behalf?<eos> I thought on this occasion you'd feel as anyone else would.<eos> Your father asked me if you agree to his idea of marriage, if it pleases you.<eos> I answered that it does.
Go.<eos> Sir?<eos> I can feel his leg, just not a pulse.<eos> All right, get me some cribbing and air bags.<eos> We need to lift and stabilize this home.<eos> You got it.<eos> Boden, you hear that?<eos> Otis, Mouch, grab me a ladder.<eos> There's someone else inside. Copy.<eos> Severide, where do you want it? Guys, right there.
I'm mad for you, Diane.<eos> Roger's dating already?<eos> O. M.G., I wonder if she's younger than him.<eos> Can you hold on a second?<eos> Lorraine, how's my favorite client?<eos> I've been on something of a hot streak at work.<eos> I've tapped into a rich vein of new clients- recently divorced moms.<eos> You might say I hit the single mother lode.<eos> How about that master suite, huh?<eos> Maybe if I had someone to share it with.
It turned into a baby boy.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I would show you a picture, but he's so cute, you may have another heart attack.<eos> Oh.<eos> - She's had a bunch of them.<eos> - Not recently, though.<eos> - I think the yoga music helps.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - He hates the music.<eos> - I loved it...
The one who was so busy shaking her tail in front of my son.<eos> - Oh, Edwards isn't dumb.<eos> - You're right.<eos> She's strategic.<eos> Jackson is dumb.<eos> Catherine...<eos> I'm going to go and salvage this patient's manhood.<eos> But when I come back, I want to have a serious conversation with you about coming home with me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I came to see if your drain output picked up after we stripped it, but...
She decided to donate a kidney after all.<eos> Take it easy, pal.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Her initial labs look good.<eos> She's, uh, headed down to the cardiac I.C.U.<eos> - if you want...<eos> - You stole that surgery from me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really wish you could have been in there with me.<eos> I worked my ass off to do that surgery with you, and you stole it from me.
All these connections have to happen... in a specific pattern.<eos> It is designed for a function.<eos> These connections determine everything about us... what we love... what we hate... what we say... what we do...<eos> Every action we take.<eos> Open your hand, okay, Mickey?<eos> Like this?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Like that.<eos> Yeah, baby!<eos> Okay, now close it.
He just keeps running away.<eos> He's dumping you.<eos> It's what he did with me.<eos> He'll pretend you're not there until you're not there.<eos> And when you're not there, he'll have sex with someone else.<eos> - Why are you gluing my mug?<eos> - It's not yours.<eos> It's Shepherd's.<eos> The mug was my responsibility.<eos> - How'd you break it?
It's a donor event, and I have my own security.<eos> It's too risky. We can't guarantee your safety.<eos> Nobody can guarantee my safety.<eos> I have many enemies...<eos> traffickers, cartels.<eos> We know what they did to your husband, what you've gone through.<eos> Your work, it's been an inspiration.<eos> I wrote my senior thesis on your time in Kuala Lumpur.<eos> I was going through a very bad time.<eos> And in some ways, I think you helped me through it.
Reddington insists on you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look at those pictures.<eos> If there is a name in that message, there's gonna be another face in that file.<eos> That'll be on you.<eos> I'll be back in a second.<eos> I just need to grab my purse.<eos> I thought it was on the counter.<eos> Hello?<eos> Did you find it?
Just once.<eos> I want to know why you chose me.<eos> Well, then, we need to move quickly.<eos> Things are already in play.<eos> WDCJ -- a small radio station five miles from here.<eos> The building was purchased six years ago by a corporation fronting for the Chinese government.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Wait. You're telling us that Wujing is running a spy ring out of a radio station?<eos> We'll meet Wujing.<eos> You'll decode the message and transmit it to your team.

And then-then one day out of nowhere, you put your jam out there. And now it's all anyone can think about.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> I worked hard on that jam.<eos> I wanted to share it, take the jam to the next level.<eos> Because sometimes people don't know they want jam unless you put it in front of them.<eos> But you can't shove your jam down people's throats.<eos> 'Cause even if you like jam, it makes you not want it!<eos> Well, maybe not, but jam has an expiration.<eos> You can't just let it sit on the shelf forever!<eos> So if you don't want my jam, then you need to tell me so I can take it elsewhere.
- Where's my 40, homes?<eos> Uh, just get in the car, scooter boy.<eos> Later.<eos> Need anything, sweetheart?<eos> No, I'm good. Thank you.<eos> You guys have been doing a lot of... remodeling.<eos> So where you at with the Irish?<eos> Thought you didn't want to know about my other business.<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> You gave my guy a gun, and his old lady's kid used it to wipe out a whole classroom.
Get my purse!<eos> - Yep, same in this reality.<eos> Coming!<eos> Wormhole weirdness.<eos> We've got 25 minutes.<eos> Hope my key still works.<eos> - Give me a hand with this.<eos> - Food first.<eos> I didn't forget your purse!<eos> You never asked me to get it!
Sorry to interrupt your doctrine.<eos> You know there's blood on the car over here?<eos> Yeah, Cheryl said she hit the guy. Doesn't look like he lost much blood.<eos> He could run, so maybe she just grazed him.<eos> Bell, she's ready to talk.<eos> Just seemed like it happened so fast.<eos> He was already inside when I came home, and I... I don't even know how he got in. You didn't have the alarm on?<eos> He had this mask on. I can describe it to a composite artist.<eos> He had a Glock handgun-- a 21, I think.<eos> He was about six-two, maybe 170 pounds, and I would definitely recognize his voice if I heard it again.
Well, why would I?<eos> His work hasn't suffered.<eos> If anything, he's been slightly more focused.<eos> Quite frankly, I'm surprised it's taken this long for the captain's marriage to buckle.<eos> He's an excellent detective.<eos> What does that have to do with it?<eos> Well, as you know, detection is a calling, not a job.<eos> Hardly leaves one with time left over to sustain the elaborate ruse of marriage.<eos> Because, of course, you think marriage is an elaborate ruse.<eos> There are other ways to describe it.
DNA sample from the blood, but there was no match in CODIS.<eos> I know, not what we hoped for, but I got a detail together, and Holmes and Watson are off running down some Holmes-and- Watson thing, so...<eos> Mmm. And I just wanted to say I'm... I'm sorry about you and Cheryl.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What else? I caught this case, so I have to be the one to ask-- you sure there's no way the separation's connected to what happened last night?<eos> Come on.<eos> It's a trial separation.<eos> It's... it's no big deal.<eos> Kids are gone from home now, and everything feels a little different.<eos> Anyway, Cheryl wants some time alone; I'm giving it to her.
Hi.<eos> I wanted you to know that I understand that this separation isn't just some... waiting period.<eos> I put you in second position for too long.<eos> And you deserve better.<eos> So I'm gonna work to give it to you.<eos> I'm not gonna push.<eos> You need space.<eos> I respect that.<eos> But I'm not gonna throw in the towel.<eos> You take this time, do what you got to do, and I'll take it, too.
Right.<eos> Fortunately, the bark is smooth on top.<eos> There.<eos> I'll wager these are the fingerprints of our murderer.<eos> There's one missing.<eos> The man we're looking for is missing the ring finger from his left hand.<eos> Should we see if he's been arrested before?<eos> Right.<eos> Mycroft, if you'd like to be useful as something other than a means of transportation, feel free to take notes.<eos> That policeman in Ulster County said we could look in the bag, not take it away.

In order to save Thomas, we must bring him back.<eos> I'm no Middle English expert but I could have sworn I heard the word "horseman" thrown in there.<eos> Indeed you did.<eos> Though not the headless one with whom we're acquainted.<eos> The colony was infected with this plague by the Horseman of Pestilence.<eos> Also known as Conquest.<eos> Another Horseman of the Apocalypse has arrived.<eos> Not yet.<eos> And not if we can stop it.<eos> Pestilence instituted this plague centuries ago but the Roanoke colony contained it, stopping its spread and thwarting the horseman from riding forth.
Anything? No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Actually, I think you were coming from that direction because I remember looking that way, so maybe if we switch.<eos> Sure.<eos> Ahem.<eos> Right.<eos> This is where we collided.<eos> Let's try again, shall we? Hey, Elena.<eos> As frustrating as it is for me not to have any memories,<eos> I really don't think that re-creating the time we met is magically gonna bring it all back.
Welcome.<eos> All right.<eos> Do I have my own bathroom?<eos> I don't have my own bathroom.<eos> It's over there.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> - What?<eos> Show me the bag.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Give it to me.
Why would you say that?<eos> I was kidding.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> You know, if we were roomies, we could do this every night.<eos> Of course, if I moved in, I'd want to... zhush up the place a little.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> Eh, it lacks zhush.<eos> It's zhush-less.<eos> Well, I think it's homey.
A couple quadrillion machines all around us, inside us.<eos> If we could just program them, control them, the possibilities are endless.<eos> Such as?<eos> Well, for starters, we could do a lot more than flip the lights off.<eos> Two of our men burst into flames just outside of Willoughby.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You don't?<eos> Your nanites absorb electricity.<eos> I wonder if they could've been modified to release it.
It's a military insignia.<eos> "Jones."<eos> You know him?<eos> (Coughs)<eos> Aye.<eos> He was my captain, and my brother.<eos> We voyaged this infernal island a long time ago.<eos> This was on the strap of his satchel.<eos> My brother lost it during a duel with Pan.<eos> Oh, it must've washed down with the rains from the storm that wrecked the "Jolly Roger."
I live here.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Captain Jones. And my leftenant.<eos> We're here by order of the King.<eos> The King, huh?<eos> We don't have any kings in Neverland.<eos> Just me.<eos> That's funny.<eos> We seek this plant.<eos> Now tell us, boy, where can we find it?
There's a bottle under the bed in the observation room.<eos> You grab that, I'll get us some real glasses, and we'll get some work done around here.<eos> Oh, finally.<eos> This was a great idea.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Let me out of here!<eos> Not until you dry out.<eos> I'm not gonna have your boozy meltdown on my head.<eos> You open this door or I'm gonna knock it down.
The spell is designed to keep anyone who casts a shadow from entering.<eos> And you don't have one.<eos> You were telling the truth about ripping your shadow off.<eos> And Pan knows it.<eos> That's why he cast the spell he did.<eos> This isn't about keeping you out. It's about drawing me in.<eos> He knows I won't give up the chance to finish what I came here to do.<eos> You really did come here to save Henry.<eos> I gave you my trust with that box.<eos> Now I need you to give it back.
In Neverland, all you have to do is think of something to have it.<eos> Even something fake.<eos> (Chuckles) But the real one... Well, let's see what it can do.<eos> No!<eos> (Whoosh) I'm sorry, Rumple.<eos> You had your chance.<eos> The choice was yours.<eos> Come on.<eos> What happened to the bean?<eos> He used it.
A victim? Ooh...<eos> Red rag to a bull.<eos> Watch this.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> Bear Grylls...?<eos> Ninja...<eos> - This is unexpected dedication, boys.<eos> - Hey, Mr Bates.<eos> Um, Sam forgot his bag because of all the crazy dog action.<eos> Is it okay if we get it?
From what I can remember, I think that's why William made me quit.<eos> He knew our mom just couldn't bear the thought of losing all of us.<eos> I wonder if that's why you enlisted.<eos> To pick up where they left off. Help people.<eos> Maybe.<eos> On the other hand, if I just would've stuck, you know, not let my brothers talk me out of being a firefighter, I don't know, maybe I could've saved them.<eos> Or you could've died, too.<eos> And you wouldn't have been able to save your nephew.<eos> Vincent, we can't change the past, as much as we both may want to.<eos> The best we can do is remember it, learn from it and move forward.
- Alive, yeah.<eos> Glad you are too.<eos> You went out there?<eos> Keep that woman breathing, you hear me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who told you to go out there?<eos> They came out to save me, Riley.<eos> And I appreciate the support.<eos> Hey, Stu.<eos> You don't let me treat that hand, you're gonna lose it.
You're gonna go warn 'em.<eos> And I'm coming with you.<eos> 'Scuse me?<eos> You see this?<eos> Randall Flynn had a ring with the exact same eye on it.<eos> If he's one of these guys, if they're half as bad as what he was, we're all in trouble.<eos> And your family could use my help.<eos> Do you think they want your help?<eos> No.<eos> But they're gonna need it.
Maybe you're with the guys you've been pulling off the armed robberies with, huh?<eos> I ain't no robber. Okay. Well, that's fine.<eos> Then you won't mind if HPD goes and searches your apartment right now, yeah?<eos> Just to make sure there's no stolen goods, right?<eos> All right, all right, man.<eos> Okay, so here's the deal:<eos> I might have some stuff back at my place, but I'm just holding it for a friend. Oh, okay.<eos> I swear I got nothing on this dead guy!<eos> I got rid of that gun two days ago.<eos> What, you dumped it?
Okay, so here's the deal:<eos> I might have some stuff back at my place, but I'm just holding it for a friend. Oh, okay.<eos> I swear I got nothing on this dead guy!<eos> I got rid of that gun two days ago.<eos> What, you dumped it?<eos> Hell no.<eos> The piece is worth 500 bucks.<eos> Old dawn patrol buddy asked me to hook his boy up with some heat, so I did him a solid.<eos> Nice solid, unloading a hot gun, you idiot.<eos> Who'd you sell it to?
You know, but Grace...<eos> And I...<eos> I cannot keep taking that away from her.<eos> You know, I mean, the whole reason I moved here in the first place was to give her some stability.<eos> I...<eos> So...<eos> Well, our timing really stinks, doesn't it?<eos> I don't know, I...<eos> Look, uh, before I met you, I, um, I was kind of looking around trying to figure out another reason to hate this place.<eos> Because I really, really hated it.
We are going twice.<eos> Fair warning on this 1911 Honus Wagner baseball card.<eos> Is sold, right here.<eos> Number 103 for $900,000.<eos> Tomorrow, you're gonna punch that guy's ticket.<eos> Well, what do you know?<eos> What's the Swede's therapist doing here?<eos> Hey, Finch, we need to find out why everyone's so interested in The Swede.<eos> So Hayden's patient is an antiques dealer, and he spent a million dollars on a baseball card?<eos> And then tossed it into some cabinet like it was junk.
Do not hypno-talk me.<eos> I'm not hypno-talking you.<eos> I'm saying, just be calm...<eos> I'm not one of your patients.<eos> I know that, I know that.<eos> You have to tell me...<eos> Finch, you ever notice how much of our job is like babysitting?<eos> Well, it's more than that today.<eos> I don't think Hayden's told us the whole story of his con.<eos> I'm going over Hayden's hard drive, what I downloaded of it before he zapped it.
Well, it's more than that today.<eos> I don't think Hayden's told us the whole story of his con.<eos> I'm going over Hayden's hard drive, what I downloaded of it before he zapped it.<eos> And I'm finding emails addressed to Sven Vanger, the antique dealer.<eos> Hayden may have elicited his email password while he was under hypnosis.<eos> It appears that Hayden duplicated an email that Sven had received, but not yet read.<eos> And he altered it in the process.<eos> And what did the email say?<eos> The email is from an anonymous address, regarding an auction that took place today.<eos> In it, Vanger was instructed to bid on lot 424, but Hayden redrafted it, instructing him to bid on lot 426.
I mean that when I say it.<eos> This synchronistic relationship that you've developed with the machine, it can't be...<eos> I worry about you.<eos> You've misunderstood the situation.<eos> You shouldn't worry about me.<eos> I'm worried about you, Harold.<eos> You can't stop what's coming, and neither can I.<eos> But we have the opportunity to understand things when they finally change.<eos> The future is coming.<eos> You started it... and I'll finish it.
he's right.<eos> you just need a win.<eos> pick your easiest, no-brainer case, and work it till it's done.<eos> fine!<eos> right after i do rosa's montreal sex thing.<eos> that sounds fun.<eos> yeah.<eos> okay, this is the junior police program.<eos> aka "mission possible."<eos> [spy music plays on tv] your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to get your life back on track.
Anyway, Lily, I told Marshall this already, but... don't worry about not sending a thank you note for the coffeemaker. It's cool.<eos> Uh, we did send a thank you note for the coffeemaker.<eos> Uh... no, you didn't.<eos> Uh... yes, we did.<eos> To Stuart and Claudia, the people who gave us the coffeemaker.<eos> Uh... what?<eos> Hey, you two!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey. Hey, thanks again for that coffeemaker.<eos> We use it all the time.
Lily, we were wrong the whole time.<eos> Ted got us the coffeemaker!<eos> He's a wonderful man!<eos> What?<eos> No. Claudia and Stuart gave us our coffeemaker.<eos> Ted's a rat bastard!<eos> Never mention his name again!<eos> Your coffeemaker?<eos> Ted got you that.<eos> I was with him when he bought it.
He's a wonderful man!<eos> What?<eos> No. Claudia and Stuart gave us our coffeemaker.<eos> Ted's a rat bastard!<eos> Never mention his name again!<eos> Your coffeemaker?<eos> Ted got you that.<eos> I was with him when he bought it.<eos> I don't know what to feel!<eos> But Stuart said he got it for us.
Oh, Ted! You are the best friend ever!<eos> Don't say another word, Marshall.<eos> Save it for the thank you note.<eos> You got it, buddy!<eos> And, kids, I got that thank you note four months later.<eos> Four months.<eos> Uh, here's your blouse back.<eos> Is there any way we could just, um... forget about all this?<eos> Oh, no, dear, you keep the blouse.<eos> Think of it as your consolation prize.
Look, we just have to put up with it, and after a while, it'll go away on its own.<eos> Go away on its own? It's a stray cat, not my father.<eos> Good night, Max.<eos> Fine.<eos> No kitty for Max.<eos> No kitty for Max.<eos> See, Max, I told you the cat would stop.<eos> Max?<eos> Max.<eos> Can we keep it, ma?

If your friend and the woman are not here by now, they will not be here at all.<eos> Much better.<eos> Oliver, get down.<eos> Follow me.<eos> We're clear.<eos> Stop the truck.<eos> Get out.<eos> Get out.<eos> Move, Lawton.<eos> That's the thing about honor, John... you can't turn it on and off.
- Like the Horseman.<eos> As in "the Horseman"?<eos> One story at a time.<eos> The Hessian took his own life to protect the weapon.<eos> No!<eos> I alone was spared.<eos> I saw what it was they sent us to claim.<eos> A chest made of stone, therefore protected from the blast covered in markings identical to this.<eos> I summoned a detachment to ferry the chest back to Washington in secret.<eos> That was the last I ever saw of it.
There we go.<eos> When I would throw a punch, I'd be so angry.<eos> I'd feel this heat rising inside of me, in my jaw.<eos> In my chest.<eos> And my fists.<eos> But it needed somewhere to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thea, you're angry.<eos> At your mother, the D.A., yourself, maybe.<eos> But that anger is going to chew up your insides if you don't let it out.
"boring mumbo jumbo."<eos> well, you could think of the algorithm as a boot and the ip address as some poor slob's skull.<eos> [smack] you know?<eos> who bragged about sitting around all day hair bags.<eos> [chuckling] except for detective finaldi.<eos> no, he had to sit around all day.<eos> a mafia thug pried both his kneecaps off with a crowbar.<eos> [whispers] gah...so lucky.<eos> this kind of data-driven police work has reduced crime by over 70%.<eos> i know hair bag work when i see it.
Or the one by the stairs?<eos> They're here to protect me.<eos> For when I leave.<eos> With the merchandise.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm sorry. I've never done this before.<eos> May I see them?<eos> - The rest, they are...<eos> - In the bag.<eos> You can carry it through Customs.
That shouldn't have happened either.<eos> You regret coming along?<eos> It's pretty impulsive.<eos> Even for me.<eos> I still don't know much about you.<eos> Except for you value really old stuff.<eos> And you value me.<eos> You're the first person to do that in a long time.<eos> So I happen to believe you're an excellent judge of character.<eos> If you think this woman deserves a second chance, we should give it to her.
- Absolutely not.<eos> - Let me know how it goes.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's this?<eos> Someone bought me a bottle of wine as a gift.<eos> Really?<eos> Don't they know you're an alcoholic and you're...<eos> No, that's why I electrified it.<eos> So I wouldn't touch it.
You hate junk food.<eos> You call it toxic poison. Yeah?<eos> Well, I've decided to live a little.<eos> Now may I be excused, scary vampire daughter?<eos> You've been avoiding me.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> Clearly.<eos> We had a moment, you and I.<eos> There was a bond.<eos> I felt it, and then nothing.
That you want to be.<eos> Sorry?<eos> The person you want to be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, let's see what we can do.<eos> Somebody's got to finish these.<eos> It's too early.<eos> To give in to melancholy.<eos> We have talked about this weakness.<eos> How you must fight it.
I was orphaned at a young age, and what I learned, I had to learn for myself.<eos> I married young.<eos> Too young.<eos> And I haven't lived a blameless life.<eos> I wonder if anyone has.<eos> I've turned my back on many things in anger.<eos> In envy.<eos> In fear.<eos> But love sustains us.<eos> We thrive on it.

- Just calm down.<eos> You think I don't know? You, Hoover and the others, - what a joke this has all been?<eos> - Jim, I...<eos> You were never on board, never for a second.<eos> I have put everything on the line!<eos> I think you should give me your sidearm.<eos> What?<eos> You are not keeping on an even keel.<eos> You want my gun, Harold?<eos> Why don't you take it?
close your eyes.<eos> oh, okay.<eos> what are you doing?<eos> i like 'em cold.<eos> okay... not that weird.<eos> like a dead guy?<eos> you're reading into that. am i?<eos> you have a really nice chest.<eos> thank you.<eos> i'd love to crack it open and get my hands all over your organs.
wow.<eos> okay, i can do that.<eos> it's no big deal.<eos> just like holding open some slimy elevator doors.<eos> for a family of aliens-- oh, my god.<eos> yep, there are some signs of stress on the heart, but that's not surprising.<eos> oh, will you look at that stomach lining?<eos> god, that is just a beaut.<eos> all right.<eos> i'm gonna need you to go ahead and take your hand... [groans] yep, get it down there.
That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.<eos> Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory.<eos> You see that cabin there?<eos> I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah.<eos> Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favorite show, not mine.<eos> Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich.<eos> Peanut butter? !<eos> Huh!<eos> That's strange, since peanut butter wasn't introduced until the early 1900s.<eos> If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.
I think I'm going batshit.<eos> I need to do something.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know how this has to go, right?<eos> You were a great guy, Kyle.<eos> But you died.<eos> I didn't let you go when I should have.<eos> I don't understand my power yet.<eos> It's new.<eos> I used it to bring you back.
I might throw you a parade.<eos> What you and your girls demonstrated last night was real grit.<eos> I finally have hope for the future of this coven.<eos> And you, my dear I'm so proud of.<eos> You really are my daughter.<eos> Now you're proud?<eos> Hell... if I knew how easy it was to win your approval, I would have made an attempt on your life way before now.<eos> What's this?<eos> A silver bullet.<eos> I found it last night in the street.
He came to me one day in the cafeteria.<eos> He swore me to secrecy and said he wanted to introduce me to somebody who would "blow my mind."<eos> He wasn't lying.<eos> My dad?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, sorry, I do have a coffee substitute made from pulverized mushroom...<eos> No?<eos> I don't blame you, it is rather, uh...<eos> Disgusting. Anyway that was the beginning of Ultra.<eos> An organization to gather and protect this new species and some day to reveal it as a great benefit to mankind.
You think of me as your enemy.<eos> But we're partners now.<eos> You know, my father believed there was a magic, invisible power all around us, and if he prayed hard enough, it would grant him a miracle.<eos> He was a horrible, stupid man who based his whole life on a fairy tale.<eos> But it's ironic.<eos> Turns out he was right... sort of.<eos> There is an invisible power that can save people.<eos> It just doesn't come from heaven, that's all.<eos> But I have to admit, it is, in its own way, a miracle.<eos> You're gonna teach me how to use it.
What's next?<eos> This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and...<eos> And what?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I've made a horrible mistake.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This table-- it's in square centimeters.<eos> I read it as square meters.
How is that possible?<eos> Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.<eos> Goody!<eos> What's it say?<eos> He's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I'd take a look at it.<eos> That's strange.<eos> That he would come to you for that and not me.<eos> Oh, I got two emails from him.<eos> "Do you have Leonard's email address?"<eos> "Never mind, I found it."
Yeah, and my eighth favorite episode of Professor Proton was "Alka-Seltzer Rocket."<eos> You said, "Plop, plop, "fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is."<eos> Remember?<eos> Remember that?<eos> Remember?<eos> He can't help it.<eos> He can't.<eos> He really can't.<eos> Oh! Wait here.<eos> I'll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye's house.
What the hell?<eos> I apologize for last night.<eos> It was important I bring you in under the radar.<eos> S.H.l.E.L.D. Tell Agent Kwan I don't need to be read the Power Protocols again.<eos> It was just a street performance. It's not like I set anyone on fire.<eos> I don't work for S.H.l.E.L.D. I come as a friend.<eos> English isn't my first language, but that word means something different than you think.<eos> I understand your frustration.<eos> But I believe you have a gift.<eos> And if you let me, I'd like to help you nurture it.

In you, I'm excited to see.<eos> What do you think of the name "Scorch"?<eos> Breathe.<eos> Feel it?<eos> Now let's see what you can do.<eos> Oh, sorry, you almost got scorched.<eos> This is incredible!<eos> You are a beautiful angel, you know that?<eos> Your power is an amazing gift.<eos> And S.H.l.E.L.D. wouldn't let me use it.
Anything from the missiles on a helicopter to a nuclear warhead sitting in its silo.<eos> So if we move on them, they could use our own weapons against us?<eos> Exactly.<eos> That's why I need a two-man team to sneak across the disputed border undetected, break into the separatist stronghold, and disable the weapon in the next 24 hours.<eos> And you have two people who fit my bill.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> I was in Georgia during the incursion in '08.<eos> I still have contacts on the South Ossetian border.<eos> And you'll have to use them.<eos> But we don't have specs on the Device, so I need someone on the team who can identify and dismantle it on site.
I know it's hard to hear, but you don't have the clearance.<eos> But I have eyes.<eos> I saw six squads in full tactical gear, three crates of RPGs, and a full crew of analysts heading into operations.<eos> Are you really telling me that has nothing to do with Ward and Fitz's mission?<eos> If I'm right, give me a signal by not saying anything.<eos> Trust the system.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He's acting like a robot version of himself right now.<eos> If we want the truth, we gotta get it ourselves.
What?<eos> I like men that are about my height, but heavier than me.<eos> Stop talking. Stop.<eos> Agent Simmons. Do you have authorization to access that panel?<eos> Say yes.<eos> Say you do.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Of course. - Great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I certainly have it right here in my bag.
But enough mission talk already.<eos> Anything exciting happen at the Hub?<eos> I shot a superior officer in the chest.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was thinking about today, and I'm really sorry...<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I didn't forget about what you asked me, back at the Hub.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The un-redacted file.<eos> About your past.<eos> I found it.
I figured you knew someone who could help.<eos> Roy can help you.<eos> I thought you wanted me to stay out of trouble.<eos> I kind of like that you never turn away from someone who needs help.<eos> I'll just get someone to cover the club.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Oh, I'm coming with you.<eos> I hear you're throwing a party.<eos> I didn't get my invite.<eos> Where exactly should I have addressed it?
I tried to warn you.<eos> I tried to ignore you.<eos> I am sorry, Oliver.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oliver threw you a lovely party.<eos> Oliver's a good son, if not the best judge of character.<eos> Is everything ok?<eos> Everything's going perfectly.<eos> He doesn't have long.<eos> If this miracle drug is onboard, then we need to find it now.
I still feel guilty about shaking down that redbox for I don't know how she does it.<eos> I did not steal it.<eos> I knowingly bought it from a man who stole it, and I'm selling it at a profit.<eos> It's the Armenian way.<eos> You're not Armenian.<eos> I know, I'm just saying, it's the Armenian way.<eos> It retails for $600, but I'll give it to you for free if you do me a favor.<eos> Free?<eos> Okay, I guess Max can do you in that closet over there.<eos> What? Now that I see it, I have to have it.
Let's skip it.<eos> Skip it?<eos> Why would we do that?<eos> We'll come back to it.<eos> No, we planned this surgery in an order.<eos> We should stick to it.<eos> Alex, if we remove the other ones first, we'll have better exposure.<eos> Let's just come back to it.<eos> It's the hardest one.<eos> If it turns out we can't remove it, What's the point of even going for the easy ones?
Don't worry.<eos> Nothing could've happened.<eos> I'm gay.<eos> Ah, that's right.<eos> You're gay.<eos> Wait.<eos> How gay? Like, one being, "Yay, it's college!"<eos> Or ten being, "I'm going Subaru shopping with Ellen and Rosie."<eos> I'm closer to a nine.<eos> I mean, I make my own soap, but I don't sell it at the Lilith Fair.
I stop when I want.<eos> Then stop.<eos> Can we have a nice lunch?<eos> - Did you take Dad's watch?<eos> - He won't miss it.<eos> Well, no, but...<eos> Don't start over a watch.<eos> I think we should leave Dad's stuff... until the will's settled.<eos> I like having that watch.<eos> I always saw Dad with it.
It's complicated.<eos> Well, not from where I'm standing, it's not.<eos> I have a boyfriend.<eos> So does my girlfriend.<eos> That's a nice suit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The problem with it is that's it's too-too tight.<eos> It's gonna be hard to conceal a weapon.<eos> The first thing Talita's guys are gonna do are pat me down.<eos> They're gonna find it anyway.
Unless they attach it to one of these.<eos> This is not good.<eos> How not good is "not good"?<eos> Very, very not good.<eos> It looks like Hayes used the intel Gary Leonida gave him to gain control of a U.S. Predator drone over Afghanistan.<eos> While a drone's in flight, it sends back continuous information on an encrypted frequency to the person controlling it on the ground.<eos> That includes GPS coordinates that the drone acquires from several satellites.<eos> If a hacker has the encryption code, he gets into the brain of the drone and sends a false GPS signal back to the ground.<eos> It's called "spoofing."<eos> So the operator thinks he's sending the drone one place when, in fact, the hacker is sending it wherever he wants it to go.
Would have been better if we could've taken Hayes alive.<eos> Chances are, he's not the only extremist in the group willing to take this to the next level.<eos> Key word is "extremist." They don't usually just put their hands in the air and surrender.<eos> He had a laptop open on the desk.<eos> If we were a few minutes later...<eos> But we weren't.<eos> Problem, Callen.<eos> Talk to me, Eric.<eos> Someone just spoofed a Predator drone over the Baluchistan province of Afghanistan.<eos> They have lost complete control of it.
- Yes, fear is exhausting.<eos> That guard will be caught before dawn, but I wish I knew Bash had returned without harm to himself or...<eos> Come and sit with me, Sarah.<eos> Tell me something about yourself I don't know.<eos> There must be some story you'd find more diverting than mine.<eos> - Some fairy tale maybe?<eos> - One with a happy ending.<eos> Shall I return that for you?<eos> You lied.<eos> You said that you had never seen the necklace, but you're the one who put it on my pillow.
I haven't been inside Keaton's mind in a long time, and I need my proper inspiration.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why do you have a picture of a bear?<eos> The great Michael Keaton attacks each new role with the ferocity of a hungry brown bear.<eos> It is his entire acting philosophy, which I totally made up.<eos> I sleep with this person.<eos> Speak to me, Keaton.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Oh, hey, Nick, that's incredible.<eos> "Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it"?
We should check that out.<eos> Finally, after all this time.<eos> I can't wait to tell the others.<eos> I told you it was real.<eos> And that I would find it.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> What you're feeling, don't fight it.<eos> That rage, it's already inside of you.<eos> Don't be afraid of it. Don't hide from its power.<eos> Embrace it! Embrace it!
You?<eos> I'm working it out.<eos> You're punching things.<eos> The last thing you need is to punch things.<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> Let me help you.<eos> The only help I need is to stop those guys before they hurt somebody else.<eos> We are the new order!<eos> Our world is being taken by gods!<eos> We will become gods and take it back!
Coulson's orders.<eos> Ah, locking me in.<eos> Well, I've been in tighter spots.<eos> This room is made of a silicon carbide-coated vibranium alloy.<eos> Meant for prisoners like yourself.<eos> But you're in here, too.<eos> And eventually, somebody will open that door.<eos> Not if I tell them not to.<eos> So, the myth is your autobiography?<eos> I didn't write it.
- Third time's the charm.<eos> - Grandma!<eos> (giggles)<eos> Daddy, are you okay?<eos> I am not the father.<eos> Shelby was artificially inseminated.<eos> (gasps)<eos> (laughs)<eos> Is this some kind of joke?<eos> You brought me down here, filled me with hope for the first time in years, and then just whisked it away?
And you want me to break the curse... to separate the Horseman from your friend.<eos> According to the Bible, a sin is a transgression of divine law.<eos> That is what the Horseman is, an abomination, walking force; pure sin.<eos> You have the power to pull him out.<eos> Where is your friend now?<eos> I was told you could tell me.<eos> Maybe.<eos> If your connection with your friend is strong enough, I could use it.<eos> It's strong.<eos> Use it.
Conrad sold my Hamptons estate.<eos> Did it just to hurt you, I bet.<eos> For the last time.<eos> From now on, I vow to be free of him.<eos> And how can I help?<eos> Allow me to put the gallery and its contents in your name.<eos> That way, he can never profit from our hard work.<eos> You trust me with this?<eos> My entire future is now in your reliable hands.<eos> And I'll do everything I can to protect it.
No.<eos> He never will.<eos> I made sure of that.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> You never called me that before.<eos> Well, I didn't know I'd be giving out business advice while you tried on shoes all morning.<eos> I'm a multi-tasker.<eos> (Chuckles) Yeah? And what's your task here?<eos> I'm surprising Jack with a cake to celebrate the bar's makeover.<eos> Actually, could you pop in and grab it while I run across the street and get a card?
I got to show you something.<eos> Adams used to hide his most valuable merch in here.<eos> - Jenny...<eos> - Adams!<eos> He's shot!<eos> Get a medic in here.<eos> Over here.<eos> Second shelf.<eos> The box.<eos> Bring it over.
The unfortunate situation was a by-product of the meager rights afforded to women at the time.<eos> It's still better to be you.<eos> Be that as it may...<eos> I need to understand why the Horseman has it.<eos> Did he take it from her?<eos> Does he know why Moloch holds Katrina captive?<eos> We need to stay on point.<eos> We are looking for his weakness.<eos> Don't let him find yours.<eos> And we shall find it.
Put 'em down!<eos> Now!<eos> You're way outnumbered.<eos> I'd do exactly as she said.<eos> Two against four?<eos> I like our odds.<eos> Check your math, Adolf.<eos> Now, put your hands behind your head.<eos> How did you acquire this necklace?<eos> You wish to wear it?
It's not working.<eos> When you were assigned here it was supposed to be better for everyone.<eos> "Smaller town easier workload, a place where Macey can get out of the city."<eos> Your words.<eos> I'll make it up to her.<eos> All I see is a small-town precinct a tenth of the size of your old one.<eos> What could possibly be such a challenge in Sleepy Hollow?<eos> Cynthia, I know it doesn't make sense but the work I'm doing here is important.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, then why can't you have someone else handle it?
- You don't need to protect him.<eos> I'm not, we only communicate via e-mail or phone.<eos> Do you have a name?<eos> No.<eos> Haven't even heard his real voice.<eos> Sorry, the office. Uh, Vincent, does this mystery handler person know you're still alive?<eos> Yeah, I would say so.<eos> Then, how about we all get off this floating safe house he put you up in.<eos> Maybe we should just get him on the phone again, trace the call and record his voice.<eos> Run it through voice recognition software.
If we are to rule as king and queen, we must trust each other to do what is necessary.<eos> I believe that you can lead them to safety.<eos> Believe that I can get myself out of that room.<eos> My God, Mary...<eos> Promise me you won't come back.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Once the door is shut, it cannot be opened again from the outside.<eos> My dear, you look lovely.<eos> You will wait until you hear two sharp taps.<eos> You will open it first for Francis, and later for me.
Is that the sleeping pill, or is that my emergency space pill that kills you?<eos> Either way, I'll get some shut-eye.<eos> Max, no!<eos> You are not gonna die and leave me here alone.<eos> I still don't know how to go East on the "L" train without a chaperone.<eos> Max, it's 3:30 A.M., and sleep coach Caroline here will have you asleep by 3:45 the latest.<eos> You're supposed to be taking a hot bath.<eos> I was, but when I put the stopper in, something pushed it back out again.<eos> Where's that pill?<eos> I've got it on my person, and if this doesn't work I'll give it to you.
That's the guy who interviewed me for the job.<eos> Please do come in.<eos> You and I... We're done.<eos> I heard about Tom. Yeah.<eos> Zanetakos confessed.<eos> Or took the fall. The passports? Forged.<eos> The money in the box?<eos> Traced to an offshore account of yours.<eos> I can only lead you to the truth.<eos> I can't make you believe it.
Merci.<eos> I despise people interrupting me when I'm working.<eos> Unless, of course, they have a good reason, and I've got a doozy.<eos> Does this mean you've reconsidered my proposal?<eos> You wish.<eos> No, I stand steadfast by my statement.<eos> You and everyone else.<eos> Perhaps, as we say in the states, you are barking up the wrong tree.<eos> Unlike the rest of you, I'm not so easily dissuaded.<eos> The truth is out there, and I won't stop until I find it.
(charles) it's a real culinary challenge.<eos> give me 15 minutes, and then we feast.<eos> you eat with your eyes, so the plating alone-- five, boyle!<eos> captain? hmm?<eos> i want to tell you something.<eos> i think you're-- like, when i was a little girl-- you think i'm like when you were a little girl?<eos> forget it. the moment's passed.<eos> is this about your toast?<eos> how'd you get that?<eos> gina gave it to me.
okay, before we eat-- nope, not doing that again.<eos> move.<eos> could you pass the, uh-- you get that hand near me again, you're gonna lose it.<eos> okeydoke, let's eat.<eos> yeah. hey, thanks for giving a copy of my toast to holt.<eos> that was nice of you.<eos> oh, you're welcome.<eos> i mean, you don't have to get so freaked out around him.<eos> you were just trying to tell him you respect him.<eos> but to be honest, i kind of gave it to him as a prank, 'cause i thought it would be super embarrassing for you.
No.<eos> You two are both terrible people.<eos> Who found each other in this crazy world.<eos> And who lie about how they found each other.<eos> Please, leave now. Just...<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right, we shouldn't have lied about our story.<eos> I love our story.<eos> Sure, it's messy, but it's the story that got us here, about to get married.<eos> I love it too.
Thanks again for helping us out.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that that was your plan?<eos> You knew I was leaving. With the guy who tried to strong-arm me out of town?<eos> You conveniently left that part out.<eos> You gave me a deadline to end this. You don't get to pass judgment about what I do when it's done.<eos> You're right.<eos> Hey.<eos> Leaving so soon? I have a few more things to check off my list.<eos> Oh.<eos> Saw it first. Now because I'm a gentleman, I'll hand it over.
How noble of you.<eos> And I think you are ready.<eos> Ready for what?<eos> For a Grayson rite of passage.<eos> Why don't you come with me into the city?<eos> That family is hiding something.<eos> I've been collecting names of Grayson Global employees.<eos> One of them will be willing to share their account.<eos> I know you're afraid of what Daniel might do, but just...<eos> Talk to Nolan. I mean, if there's a story to tell, he'll tell it.
She loves him just as much as you do, if not more.<eos> I don't know what lies that girl sold you, but she cares about nothing but money and status.<eos> Sara, I can prove it to you.<eos> Please? Please give me a chance.<eos> For Daniel's sake, please.<eos> Well, if we've owned this place for decades, why is this the first I'm hearing of it?<eos> You haven't yet earned your spot in the club.<eos> Soon you'll be married, and your dues will be paid.<eos> How the hell did you keep this from Mom when we were in the red?<eos> Because the deed is solely in my name, given to me by my father, whose father gave it to him.
I gave it to you that summer.<eos> I never told you, but... After the accident, I thought I'd lost you.<eos> I spent that night pacing the hospital halls.<eos> By the time the doctors came by to tell me that you were stable, the diamond had cut into my palm from clenching it so tightly.<eos> I mean, I didn't even realize the E.M.T.s had given it to me.<eos> You held onto it all this time.<eos> I never... thought you'd allow me the chance to return it.<eos> - We can't undo our past, Danny.<eos> - I know.<eos> I just don't wanna forget it, either.
They have one thing in common.<eos> What?<eos> We got his home address. Let's roll.<eos> We went looking for the real identity of the man posing as Denning and Gard.<eos> The one thing we knew going in, was that the man we were looking for was not Nathaniel Wolff.<eos> We were wrong.<eos> Reddington was right. What proof do you have?<eos> The items we found are basically a love letter from Wolff to his father.<eos> Wolff's father was a mechanic who worked his entire life at PTB Aviation.<eos> When Wolff was 6, a corporate raider bought the airline and sold it off.
So this General Ludd group, you're, like, the poster child for everything they hate.<eos> How does that feel?<eos> You worried?<eos> Not in the Gold Club, I'm not. Ha-ha.<eos> Know what I'm saying?<eos> Sophie? Do me a favor?<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> I left my logbook six gates away.<eos> Would you watch my stuff?<eos> I'll put it in first class. We're boarding any minute.
You go see your father.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is it really worth it, this job?<eos> Risking your life? For what?<eos> The privilege of living in some crappy studio apartment?<eos> They own you.<eos> You get one bite of the apple.<eos> Should have known when you agreed to help us that you would take something for yourself.<eos> We didn't think he could access the safe on the truck but he did.<eos> He swapped the original drive for a counterfeit, and when we arrested him, he didn't have it.
We have credible intelligence that you're being targeted for assassination.<eos> My contacts at the CIA were sitting on an Egyptian sleeper cell.<eos> They intercepted communication between them and an informant called Wells.<eos> Hilton Wells?<eos> - You obviously know him.<eos> - You obviously don't.<eos> Hilton Wells doesn't speak with the Egyptians.<eos> He hasn't since he aligned himself with Mubarak during the Arab Spring.<eos> I can show you the transcripts.<eos> With all due respect, if the intel were worth having, then I would have it.
How many people are going to die here today, Reddington?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Your heart is pumping harder and harder, trying to compensate for blood loss.<eos> And that shotgun blast broke your leg.<eos> I think it also partially ruptured your femoral artery.<eos> Partially?<eos> You would have bled out by now if the hole were any bigger, but now I have to close it.<eos> - Close it how?<eos> - By cauterizing it.<eos> I'm gonna have to cut open your leg to get at the artery and then sprinkle some combustible compound on it - and ignite it.
His name is Ryan Demsky, 9 years old.<eos> He was here on vacation with his dad from St. Paul, Minnesota.<eos> You said this disease is rare. How rare?<eos> In the last 5 years, there have been a handful of Kurz infections worldwide.<eos> We've seen almost 600 new cases since July, which seems impossible, since the virus isn't particularly contagious.<eos> Unless someone was intentionally spreading it.<eos> That's the conclusion we came to, as well.<eos> A few months back, Atlanta opened up an investigation tracking large infection clusters.<eos> Our suspect has a background in biological and chemical warfare.<eos> Is it possible that he weaponized this disease and somehow modified it to make it more lethal?
Freeze!<eos> I'm only gonna say this once...<eos> drop the gun. You first.<eos> I'm gonna count to 3.<eos> If that gun is not on the ground, I will shoot this man.<eos> And you will be dead one second after.<eos> 1, 2, 3!<eos> You don't have to do this!<eos> All right!<eos> All right! Drop the gun and kick it away.
Well, if it's with you, it's gonna be brief.<eos> Remember, you owe me.<eos> No, Han.<eos> At that club, I saw a pregnant wall.<eos> I think we're even.<eos> If I'm here to meet June, why am I blindfolded?<eos> So you can never find your way back to our apartment again.<eos> But I have your address on your work forms.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Max, I think he can take it off now.
Love can mean many things, Felix.<eos> It doesn't just come from romance or family.<eos> It can also come from loyalty.<eos> Friendship.<eos> Only one person has always believed in Pan.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Be flattered.<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> If I'm back in my own body, that means I'll have the scroll.<eos> I... I can bring it to you guys.
Almost.<eos> How can I ever make it up to you?<eos> Well, now that you mention it... I've got a few ideas.<eos> No, I'm afraid, we're closed.<eos> Whatever crisis you're dealing with,<eos> - I'm done for the day.<eos> - Rumple.<eos> Pandora's box... give it to me.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> We need to open it.
- What?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - Good luck with that.<eos> - Grandpa! Sorry, honey.<eos> Part of the job. - Out of the way!<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Who did this?<eos> Guess it's just you and me.<eos> My cake!<eos> Somebody ruined it.
Giving her that 20% was my idea.<eos> I love my husband.<eos> He was too proud to reach out to Haley at first, and so I convinced him.<eos> So if all I cared about was the will, why would I have done that?<eos> Why wouldn't I have just let it alone and let Ian take his chances?<eos> I'm assuming your husband can verify all this?<eos> He can.<eos> He can also verify that there is language in the will that guarantees Haley's share goes to her mother in the event that she predeceases her.<eos> Haley's death didn't change anything for me.<eos> Maureen might have been able to tell you that if she had supported Haley's decision instead of condemning it.
Barber, behind the trees.<eos> Fall back!<eos> Everybody okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was told Braithwaite wanted to see me.<eos> He's indisposed.<eos> What were you doing at Hillcrest, at my cabin?<eos> I had no idea it was your cabin.<eos> But you went up there for a reason.<eos> And you set it to explode for a reason.
That's a shame.<eos> It's voicemail.<eos> You really don't want him to know you're here, do you?<eos> Yeah, you don't.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> Why don't we send him a text?<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Are you prepared to kill me?<eos> What?<eos> From the way you're holding that gun I can tell you don't get a lot of opportunity to use it outside of target practice.
Yes.<eos> We spoke this morning.<eos> All right.<eos> Pull him in for a polygraph anyway.<eos> Where are we with the D.C. police, Calder?<eos> Aren't you gonna introduce us?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where are we with the police?<eos> D.C. police think they caught a Jane Doe.<eos> We replaced all camera footage at the bus station with dummy footage, and claimed her corpse from the city morgue and disposed of it.
I'll have Wilson run another stress test.<eos> You watch.<eos> Flying colors.<eos> You know, if you get out of here in time, you can have Thanksgiving dinner at our house if you and Catherine don't have plans.<eos> You cookin'?<eos> Is that so preposterous?<eos> You want a straight answer?<eos> No, Owen's girlfriend is cooking.<eos> Does she put mushrooms in her stuffing?<eos> I find it makes it soggy.
Well, you barely looked.<eos> Let me see. No, no, no, I-I looked, and... No more tickets.<eos> Leonard, let me look in the box.<eos> Okay, okay!<eos> I'm gonna show you what's in the box. but just... promise not to flip out.<eos> Why would I flip out?<eos> Is it a spider?<eos> It's a spider!<eos> No, if it was a spider, Lenny would've flipped out.<eos> Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card.
Let me ask you a question.<eos> At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> Oh, you brought beer for everybody.<eos> Uh, okay, yeah, it's for everybody.<eos> I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.<eos> You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.<eos> Howard, the medicine's not working!<eos> You just took it.

It won't.<eos> They're gonna take out Hoffman.<eos> Well, if that's what they want.<eos> There's nothing we can do about it.<eos> Unless I can convince him to drop the case.<eos> We're not criminals.<eos> I've been chasing a few leads, but I haven't found anything interesting.<eos> Not yet, but I'll keep digging.<eos> Good, because the answer's out there somewhere.<eos> We just need to find it.
How do you feel if tomas is that man?<eos> I feel that we should remember it's still a secret.<eos> At least until king henry releases me From my engagement to francis.<eos> That's no answer.<eos> Walk with your uncle.<eos> Almost agreed?<eos> You and king henry have been talking for days.<eos> What have you been discussing? The weather?<eos> These are tricky matters of state.<eos> Your marriage treaty with portugal doesn't end Our alliance with France but changes it.
I control you.<eos> Just like all the others.<eos> People like you, you think you're so smart that you know what's inside me, you don't know and you never will.<eos> You can't possibly imagine what a great pleasure it is to have you as my guest.<eos> Gary?<eos> Don't go anywhere.<eos> Gary?<eos> I heard someone here needs soup. Emily, hi.<eos> Didn't you get my message?<eos> I ignored it, like any good girlfriend would when her man says he's sick.
So how is it that you didn't see any of this coming?<eos> How is it possible you didn't consider embarrassing a colleague could blow up in our faces?<eos> I would hardly consider the man a "colleague." Well, that's what he is.<eos> Whether you like it or not.<eos> He wants to put criminals away just like us.<eos> Just like that cop you scolded on the bridge yesterday.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, are you telling me I need to be nicer?<eos> You can be nice.<eos> I know that you can.<eos> You have this tiny little zone of courtesy, but you're only ever willing to extend it to me.
You were the only dude that was there.<eos> That's not a choice, man.<eos> That's Communism.<eos> Are you accusing me of being a Communist?<eos> ( Laughs ) You know what?<eos> So you hang onto your table saw for that broken heart because it is gonna need some mending.<eos> But a table saw cuts things.<eos> Shut your face.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> All right, well, if you don't want it, I'll just have to return it.
I thought I should speak with you first.<eos> Obviously this is a very sensitive issue in the case of the President.<eos> If people find out he's being tested for any form of cognitive impairment, well, I assume that's the kind of thing you'd want to keep private.<eos> You were right to come to me.<eos> I appreciate your candor and your discretion.<eos> As his doctor, I would feel irresponsible not recommending further testing.<eos> But if we go through the official channels, I find it hard to believe we could keep it secret.<eos> Do you have an alternative proposal?<eos> His upcoming surgery presents a unique opportunity.<eos> I believe I could take a blood sample without drawing attention, but I would need help getting it out of the hospital into a private lab.
"D"...<eos> "A"...<eos> "D".<eos> Now just watch this.<eos> "Dad."<eos> I'm making you a memory to help you remember stuff like turning off the stove, and if I keep working on it, I think I can make it so it can remember all the things that you can't.<eos> Now, we talked about this.<eos> I mean, what's wrong with me can't be fixed by you or by anybody else, okay?<eos> But what if I build a machine with lots of memory, one that could think?<eos> Well, even if you could, even if you could fill it with all my memories, it still wouldn't be me.
Yes.<eos> Harold, it's what we always dreamed of.<eos> Samaritan is a true artificial intelligence.<eos> You're right, Arthur.<eos> That is remarkable.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Is he talking about what I think he's talking about?<eos> It would appear so.<eos> But then that would mean--<eos> That there was a second machine. And Arthur built it.
We did discuss marriage once.<eos> A moment of weakness.<eos> Lovers, dreaming of a future together.<eos> I was... caught up.<eos> And not sure that the Scottish alliance was a good one.<eos> Caught up with a noble girl.<eos> And a very rich one.<eos> Not one with a country in need, hanging around her neck.<eos> It's ironic, isn't it?<eos> That the very alliance that forged our engagement has always complicated it terribly.
And now you're telling me that the grand prize for a life of public service might be death.<eos> You have to have faith in the Lord's plan.<eos> If God has a plan, who's it for?<eos> Me or him?<eos> Wait, what aren't you telling me?<eos> What's happening to you, Frank?<eos> I remember why I stopped coming here.<eos> From the 18th century?<eos> No, I don't think we have any records on Trinity Church.<eos> Madam, this town has existed since Adriaen van der Donck dubbed it Sleeper's Haven in 1655.

Seriously?<eos> That guy's in no shape to be dating anyone.<eos> Well, you don't know what he was like on his meds.<eos> Silas and his queen were together till about six months ago, I would venture.<eos> These photographs-- all taken over the last three years.<eos> There are none from last summer.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Maybe she's the one who broke up with him.<eos> Okay, look at this necklace.<eos> Maybe he gave it to her as a gift.
- Hi, honey.<eos> - Oh, yay, I'm pregnant!<eos> Don't I have to have sex to be pregnant?<eos> Okay, for heaven's sake, we had a party for Darlene in accounting.<eos> I thought you could use some cheering up.<eos> Why would I need cheering up?<eos> Just because my video is more popular than that monkey flinging his poop?<eos> - So you spilled a little coffee.<eos> - Or threw it.<eos> I did not throw it!
They use carrier pigeons.<eos> Carrier pigeons.<eos> I staked out Tomsa's apartment, Lo and behold, he had a visit from a bird with a message strapped round its foot.<eos> He read the message, he scrawled a reply, and he set the beast free.<eos> I tracked it here.<eos> You can follow a pigeon? You can.<eos> Now it's just a question of waiting to see who comes along to read the message.<eos> We'll have our connection.<eos> You've been tending to your self-defense. Well done.<eos> Department's got six guys grinding this case, and you broke it open by following a bird. Mm.
The acetone, meanwhile, is dissolving the gun he used to murder her, leaving nothing but a milk-like liquid in the bottle in his refrigerator.<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> And all of this from a photograph of a pint of milk?<eos> And a nail.<eos> It's illegal for a gun company to make or manufacture a plastic weapon.<eos> But with advances in 3-D printing, it makes it possible for anyone with the right specs to build one in the comfort of their own home.<eos> They only need one piece of metal to make it work:<eos> a nail to act as the firing pin.<eos> Now, Pendry couldn't very well melt a nail, could he?<eos> So he hid it in plain sight.
He used one of the victim's own knives to kill him.<eos> You think a planner like Pendry would've brought a weapon of his own.<eos> Also the stab wound was obviously the result of a left-handed blow.<eos> But Pendry is right-handed, so why would he use his non-dominant hand to stab someone to death?<eos> You knew Pendry was a righty, right?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, I was wrong, Watson.<eos> Pendry does still have a printer.<eos> And he used it to build another gun.
According to my Google alert for Max's homemade cupcakes- you have a Google alert for our business?<eos> I only have a Google alert for "Oprah goes topless."<eos> I'm not saying it's gonna happen, but I'm saying, if it does, I'm gonna be the first one to know.<eos> Look, it's online that Roland Glass died in front of our shop.<eos> And now my phone just died.<eos> It's an epidemic.<eos> Oleg, what are you still doing with the arrow from our shop?<eos> I thought that you said that was hung.<eos> No, I said I was hung.<eos> And I can't put it up now with that crowd of people in front of your window.
Then I'm gonna put this here, next to Paddington bear.<eos> I caught this at his last concert.<eos> And I also caught this.<eos> So, like, what, dude?<eos> He just dropped to the ground?<eos> Actually, he hit right here first, smiled, then fell.<eos> He smiled?<eos> Dude. Max, can I see you over here?<eos> Sorry for your loss and dope hat.<eos> Thanks. I found it in a dumper.

That's too personal.<eos> - Sorry you had to do that. - So am I.<eos> - It's healing nicely.<eos> I think it's nice of us to add our flowers to the others.<eos> Shows respect.<eos> You're acting like you didn't steal them.<eos> Max, it's the thought that counts.<eos> And I thought it'd be cheaper to pull them out of someone's garden.<eos> Wait, where's the shrine?<eos> Look, Han moved it over to the diner door.
- Hey, are you busy?<eos> I think you need to get down to the courthouse on sixth.<eos> And what's the problem?<eos> Oh, nothing much, just some rampant witness and jury tampering.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks for getting down here so fast.<eos> It is going off the rails in there.<eos> You heard of Barry Kellogg, the lawyer?<eos> He's pretty famous, handling the Nidaria case.<eos> Oh, he's handling it, all right.
And they all tell the same story.<eos> The story of a quiet, upstanding, law-abiding citizen caught in the clutches of a uncaring judicial system intent upon prosecuting an innocent man.<eos> My friends, the fate of this man is in your hands.<eos> It's up to you to see that justice is done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Eric, welcome back.<eos> You look fabulous.<eos> So do you.<eos> Which brings us to the key.<eos> I don't have it.

Okay.<eos> Ezra's asking for you.<eos> He's very agitated.<eos> I'll be there as soon as I can, Deb, I promise.<eos> Van.<eos> You all right, buddy?<eos> Wait, no, no, no.<eos> Sorry. Just...<eos> Open the trunk.<eos> Open it.
No!<eos> Anton, let go of me!<eos> Let her go!<eos> Get out!<eos> Khloe!<eos> This is Burkhardt, I'm in foot pursuit of an armed suspect at Nolen's books on northwest first and Davis.<eos> Heard the suspect took a div-yeah.<eos> - Alive or dead?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But if he came up, it was not where I could see it.
And what's he doing here?<eos> Well, he says he's here to discuss family matters, but I never believe a word he says.<eos> You should know that his mother tried to murder mine, and me.<eos> That would make for an awkward Christmas.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> I was never included.<eos> So your brother is the one who wants the key.<eos> All the royal families want the key.<eos> My brother is just more determined.<eos> He knows how much power it would give him if he had it.
Different from what I imagined.<eos> I understand he's not exactly traditional.<eos> - Well, neither am I.<eos> - From what I've heard, he's proven tremendously effective.<eos> Taking out two reapers and sending their heads back made a hell of an impression.<eos> He also took out a Mauvais Dentes and a Nuckelavee.<eos> Both gifts from the family, I assume?<eos> Yes, he's proven rather more worthy than we anticipated.<eos> Which brings us back to the key.<eos> Adalind says you need yet more time to get it.
Does Florence have an interest in France?<eos> Florence has an interest in everything.<eos> So tell me, what do you think of this one?<eos> Forsake the colourful display.<eos> Wear the simple black satin.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?<eos> They have never met a Riario, or a Medici, let alone a Borgia.<eos> Italian wealth unsettles them.<eos> As much as they want it, it offends their martial nature.
But as to the matter of an army we have need of one ourselves.<eos> For an invasion of Milan, I would hazard.<eos> Do you read our thoughts?<eos> Before one thinks of them, Your Highness.<eos> This young man is clairvoyant.<eos> The last French invasion ended in disaster for all concerned.<eos> Maybe if the next was under Italian leadership...<eos> Yours, I presume?<eos> With the blessing of the pope of Rome, of course.<eos> And he would give it?
I woke up one morning and I realised he's not in his heaven.<eos> The world will not change if I do nothing to change it.<eos> After him!<eos> Come on!<eos> Don't let him away!<eos> Wait.<eos> What does the boar fear more than this arrow?<eos> I know not.<eos> The pool.<eos> My Uncle Ferrante had it built, stocked with lampreys flesh-eating eels, for the ones he hated the most.
- What?<eos> - Your sacred person is healthy still.<eos> Catherina Sforza?<eos> Who else?<eos> Walk with us.<eos> What do we need to know of this matter?<eos> As little as possible.<eos> But a letter was sent.<eos> A false overture of peace.<eos> I ordered it burnt.
No.<eos> No, no killing.<eos> You must keep on loving this boy.<eos> I can hate and love.<eos> These words are worth more than gold.<eos> They will tell us what she thinks. What she plans.<eos> All eyes.<eos> Are we in need of protection?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Well, then why do we have it?
How can they just dry up?<eos> Someone has been buying the supplies from Solfatara Caldara.<eos> And that someone has in their power a moratorium on warfare.<eos> What a clever move.<eos> Catherina Sforza?<eos> Too clever even for her.<eos> We need a spy out there.<eos> Someone to smell out sulphur.<eos> Prospero?<eos> I shall sniff it out, my lord.
Because I didn't give you time enough.<eos> But with enough time, you would have burnt me in that mound of sulphur. Huh?<eos> Is it true, Baglioni?<eos> Too true, my lord.<eos> Why, Baglioni, why?<eos> Because, my friend, this is what we do.<eos> We are connoisseurs of treachery.<eos> So can anyone tell me who owns this pile of dust?<eos> Catherina Sforza?<eos> Why would she store it in Rome?

And no questions.<eos> My backpack wasn't upstairs.<eos> What's that?<eos> Postcard from a friend of Claire's- - Rachel.<eos> "Living it up in Club Med Cozumel."<eos> Looks like that marriage went down the drain.<eos> In other shocking news, Phil subscribes to a trampoline magazine.<eos> Going through other people's mail-- keeping it classy, Jay.<eos> Mom, my backpack isn't in Luke's room.<eos> I don't see it in here, either.
Is that one of Claire's brownies?<eos> No, they're delicious.<eos> Must be Cam's.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> There's more.<eos> No!<eos> That's where my backpack is.<eos> Cam drove me and Luke home.<eos> I must've left it in his car.
Matter of fact, I was thinking we could all drive up to Yellowstone this summer.<eos> But I say, let's take this beeyotch ocean to ocean!<eos> - That'd be cool!<eos> - Awesome!<eos> We're doing it!<eos> Phil, the road!<eos> I don't know what button I just pressed, but that was amazing.<eos> My backpack's definitely not in there.<eos> Well, they're not picking up their phone.<eos> He must've brought it inside.

Is it so much to ask?<eos> And anyway, why did Mrs Dudley Ward have a letter from the Prince in her handbag?<eos> I expect it was a love thing.<eos> Well, it won't be much of a "love thing" when it appears in the American newspapers.<eos> Do you think that's why he took it?

That's a crisis.<eos> Only gonna ask you once.<eos> - Did you hit him? - Yeah.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> Asshole!<eos> Can I see you again?<eos> Let me make sure you're okay.<eos> - I wanna taste you. - Fuck.<eos> Inhale.<eos> Gather that anger and when you exhale, just let it go.
What am I supposed to do, just John Doe him?<eos> I don't know. You're a cop.<eos> Make something up.<eos> That's what I pay you for.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You took me off a real homicide for a fucking log?<eos> You don't pay me enough, Ray.<eos> Hey, what's happening?<eos> Get someone to pick up Ezra's car at the impound.<eos> Drop it by the body shop.

The answer is no.<eos> If you would like a "yes", go buy it from somebody else.<eos> We might have underestimated just how much tincture is necessary to knock the pig out.<eos> Again, I'm very sorry.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Have I ever told you about the time I pissed in that pimp's hat?<eos> No.<eos> Hmm.<eos> It was quite an offloading.<eos> I nearly filled it right up to the brim.
Ah, just kidding, of course.<eos> This Paul Randolph's no fish in a barrel.<eos> He was a... a Marine, served two tours in Iraq. Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Won a Silver Star. Perfect.<eos> So... Barbie, you in or out?<eos> This is Phil Bushey with an update concerning the ongoing manhunt in town.<eos> Former Deputy Paul Randolph's squad car has been spotted off the road at Black Ridge Woods.<eos> All Chester's Millers are under an advisory to stay home until the situation is resolved.<eos> Looks like he abandoned it.
You want to know what's ridiculous?<eos> Bringing me into a fight with one hand tied behind my back.<eos> I happen to know my way around two things -- mental health and Sicilian cooking.<eos> So why don't you help me help your client, or else let me go home and cook some lasagna where people are not second-guessing me at every turn?<eos> All right, Nico, will you give Dr. Santino<eos> Hutch's medical records, please?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> We don't have time for a fishing expedition.<eos> We brought on Dr. Santino to do a job.<eos> Let's let her do it.
What's wrong?<eos> I just... I need some air.<eos> It's boiling hot in there.<eos> Mom, are you okay?<eos> She-She's fine.<eos> Alice, just get back in the car.<eos> I'll blast the AC.<eos> What time's our flight?<eos> What flight?<eos> To L.A. I don't want to miss it.
Can I watch?<eos> Kidding.<eos> No.<eos> I'd like you to stay.<eos> They will go away.<eos> Harriet.<eos> Hi.<eos> Everything okay? I'm sorry, I know it's early.<eos> Do you have any yogurt?<eos> The food mart's emptied out after the people raided it, and it's the only thing I can keep down.
Well, things are looking up in this town.<eos> Yeah, I heard, uh, Barbie got the water flowing again.<eos> A lot of Chester's Millers made that happen.<eos> And I just, uh, hammered out a food deal with our farmers.<eos> We barter goods and services for vegetables, meat.<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause I want to keep this place open.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know I can't run it as good as Rose did.
- I get it.<eos> - We both care about him.<eos> - Fresh start?<eos> Absolutely, yes, that would be...<eos> thanks.<eos> Kiera, I...<eos> I'll see you around.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Forgot the damn key.<eos> Can you find the key to the storage locker and bring it in here, please?
That is so clever.<eos> Yeah, for a T-shirt.<eos> That's right up there with<eos> "I'm not as think as you drunk I am."<eos> Look, the end of a relationship is a lot like a death.<eos> There's a mourning process.<eos> You haven't even begun to examine the issues that contributed to the end of your last relationship. ( Laughing )<eos> What?<eos> That T-shirt thing.<eos> I just got it.
I can't believe you did this. I'm sorry.<eos> I just snapped.<eos> I can't go back to the magic, Charlie.<eos> You ruined a relationship with one of my patients.<eos> And you know what?<eos> Your magic sucks.<eos> It's always the ace of spades, I can see the coin in your hand, and you use a fake thumb.<eos> Oh, my God. How do you know that?<eos> Because you're black and the thumb isn't.<eos> You cannot take a white thumb and color it with a Magic Marker.
Where the hell is Santana?<eos> Dropped him uptown.<eos> So you've been driving this vehicle all night?<eos> No, he picked me up at my cousin's and then I dropped him.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Why are you parking it here?<eos> He said this is where he wanted his car for the night.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Would you open the trunk, please?<eos> Open it yourself.
I gave Brian Duffy a concussion.<eos> That was one of your worst cakes ever.<eos> Coconut is not so bad...<eos> No way.<eos> Grace, can I have a word, please?<eos> Okay, so...<eos> Granted, I was snooping on your computers, but, I found this code, and it looks a lot...<eos> I mean a lot... Like code that I wrote at MIT.<eos> That's because it is your code.<eos> The university sold it to the D.O.D.
I know all about you.<eos> And you, Ms. Shaw.<eos> Since your untimely departure from Northern Lights, I understand that you're in need of a cause.<eos> The only thing I need is an excuse to put this bullet in between your eyes.<eos> I got one.<eos> Your company strapped a bomb to my chest and used me to plant a virus, a virus you're going to tell me how to stop.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I'm rather invested in the outcome of that virus.<eos> Besides, my company adapted its code, but it didn't originate with Decima.<eos> We found it on a laptop, the very same laptop that you and Kara Stanton were sent to retrieve from Ordos, China.
- Was gonna do my cool poses.<eos> You ready?<eos> One, two... d Who's that girl?<eos> d Who's that girl?<eos> d d Who's that girl?<eos> d Who's that girl? d d It's Jess.<eos> - You changed.<eos> - Check it out.<eos> Schmidt gave me his worst suit.<eos> He said, if I could get it over my thighs, he didn't want it.
I'm Jessica Day.<eos> I'm the, uh, maid of honor.<eos> I'm also the person who fell through the roof with my friend Nick Miller here.<eos> Um, I have a few things to say.<eos> Um, there might be a badger on the loose, but I have my best people on it.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Don't scare the badger!<eos> - Schmidty, help me!<eos> - Okay!<eos> - Funnel it into the mandap!
♪ You don't want to get behind me ♪<eos> Ready?<eos> ♪ First place in the race ♪ Break!<eos> Red 100! ♪ I'm moving real swift ♪<eos> ♪ Everybody bet I'm ready ♪<eos> Watch him. ♪ Like, "man, he's quick" ♪<eos> Ten-hut!<eos> That's my bad, T.K.

I know you weren't blaming that T-I-P on the K-I-N-G.<eos> I didn't see anybody else tip the ball right into the defense's hands.<eos> Well, the only reason that ball was tippable because I powered up Super Mario brothers style and went and go got it.
But you never play the tape through to the end.<eos> Well... He could be a real jerk sometimes.<eos> And, um there were other women.<eos> I guess I just need to watch the whole movie instead of just the good parts. Mm-hmm.<eos> Maybe.<eos> And when one door closes, another one opens.<eos> Yeah?<eos> It's Lars.<eos> I've got your, uh, call sheet for Thursday.<eos> I'll leave it on the counter.
And I brought the chopper to personally escort you to town for a camera-ready reunion. Mm.<eos> Well, you seem awfully confident that this election's going to turn in your favor.<eos> Well, it already has, thanks to you, in part.<eos> You may not have driven the final nail in my opponent's coffin, but by recording your conversation with the governor's wife about his tragic heart condition, you deftly made the public aware of his imminent need of one.<eos> I wouldn't expect any concession calls just yet.<eos> Jack Porter knows what happened on the Amanda.<eos> And he's determined to find the computer that led to Amanda's death.<eos> That's why he joined your campaign.<eos> Well, luckily for all of us, the computer he seeks is currently deteriorating somewhere on the ocean floor. Oh.<eos> Jack said he was in possession of it up until the funeral.

Alfonso, I thank you with all my heart for the money you sent me.<eos> I'm sending you a picture of the house.<eos> Bye, Rosa.<eos> It's like with Bettencourt.<eos> I'll have to put him under supervision. What is this mess?<eos> Even in my grandfather's time, we were better equipped.<eos> We'll go give them a hand.<eos> A letter's arrived.<eos> It's from very far.<eos> Take it.
Of course not.<eos> Do you realize I had to be sent miles away from you to fall in love?<eos> I've always wanted you to get married.<eos> - It's no my fault if...<eos> - I know. - You don't do it on purpose.<eos> - Look at your brother. He didn't have to go that far to...<eos> That's true. It's different with him.<eos> You know she talked your grandpa into giving her a ring?<eos> My mother's ring. It should have stayed in the family.<eos> I gave it to her.
Daddy wants to talk to me privately.<eos> - Love you, sweetie.<eos> - Love you, Daddy.<eos> Brian, I'll just be right outside.<eos> So, Max...<eos> You know I'm all talk, right?<eos> I need you to tell Caroline something I couldn't bring myself to say.<eos> This woman is also claiming I have a small penis.<eos> Wait.<eos> So I stayed behind to see it?
Friends!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Yes, from some points of view, you could say I'm a terrorist.<eos> I instill fear, terror into those that want me silenced, the ones that want all of you silenced!<eos> So if fighting for you, the ones that can't fight for themselves, makes me a terrorist, then I guess that's exactly what I am.<eos> But same with George Washington and Nelson Mandella,<eos> Geronimo!<eos> Any kid who picks up a stone and throws it at a tank advancing on his village!
I remember a leather apron and something being heated in a fire.<eos> ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪<eos> Well, I found my blacksmith.<eos> He now shares an artisan barn with a lady who makes clothing out of bees.<eos> I guess that's why our cupcake shop didn't work.<eos> We weren't providing a service that everyone needs.<eos> I looked at our boy, and not only does Chestnut need four new shoes, he has a hoof fungus.<eos> A hoof fungus?<eos> That's so ghetto.<eos> I'm pretty sure he got it from me because we shower together.
Well, in the words of opposing counsel, even if that were true, we have every right to do it.<eos> Hi, Donna.<eos> I love your dress.<eos> And I love when you compliment me before you ask for something.<eos> You're so insightful.<eos> Look, I know we said Harvey and Mike's problem isn't our problem, but Louis is stealing Mike.<eos> It's not stealing when someone's available for the taking.<eos> You knew?<eos> When do I not know?<eos> Louis asked for Harvey's blessing with Mike, and he gave it.
Thank you.<eos> Federal agents!<eos> They're gone.<eos> Eric, what are you seeing?<eos> They've disabled the camera outside the room, and they're not on any of the other hotel cameras.<eos> I'm looking at the lobby, the garage...<eos> What about traffic cameras surrounding the hotel?<eos> Searching.<eos> Sidorov found a way out.<eos> Find it.
First, we start its heart.<eos> 1,000 volts, circuit one.<eos> 3,000 volts!<eos> 3,000 volts, circuit one.<eos> It's beating.<eos> Success.<eos> You can't leave now!<eos> I must find Renfield.<eos> You are about to host a party at which known members of the Order will be present.<eos> Professor, if you ever valued that arm, take it off mine... immediately!
Where's your mate?<eos> Hi!<eos> I'm Virginie.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Are you blanking me because I'm Chinese?<eos> No, it's because I'm shy.<eos> Where's the fridge?<eos> I dunno.<eos> It was here yesterday.<eos> If you took it, I'd rather you told me.
And this is the list of what you need to buy.<eos> You're right, we do need help.<eos> Sort things with the Roms.<eos> You're taking the piss.<eos> - A real gem.<eos> - What's that heap of shit?<eos> An electricity meter.<eos> It isn't powerful enough!<eos> It's 200 euros.<eos> Do you want it or not?
An electricity meter.<eos> It isn't powerful enough!<eos> It's 200 euros.<eos> Do you want it or not?<eos> You don't...<eos> Well?<eos> For 50, I'll take it.<eos> Want me to drop my trousers too?<eos> You Arabs always haggle.<eos> Take it for 200 euros or don't take it.
I just want you to know I am ready to jump in and make a difference.<eos> I was thinking I could start by cheering up some kids.<eos> You know, maybe a cute little girl with a lisp who says something like, "I wuv you, Wiley."<eos> Or- - Oh oh! Also I aced my C.P.R. test.<eos> - Number one in my class--<eos> - Stop right there. I really need you to pull back on the perkiness.<eos> It's nauseating!<eos> Now, this job is simple.<eos> This is the magazine cart.<eos> You cart it around.
I wasn't sure you were ready to do what had to be done.<eos> What'd you tell Martinez and Rosicki?<eos> To capture Julian Randol, get him to confess to what he did, and lead us to the location of his Liber8 friends by any means necessary.<eos> What?<eos> That's how we're doing things now?<eos> It's what's required.<eos> Inspector, that's bullshit and you know it!<eos> - Detective! - What?<eos> You think I like the idea of leveraging a kid?<eos> He is part of the cancer that is killing this city and when you have cancer, you cut it out.
- Yes, it is.<eos> But she was meant to write about the French Revolution. You didn't know...<eos> Yes, we knew.<eos> Amanda didn't like the subject, so we had her write about something else.<eos> OK...<eos> Then I'd like... ln an affirming way, I say that was wrong.<eos> - l've made up a study programme.<eos> - We'd like to talk about that.<eos> - OK...?<eos> - We don't think it's very ambitious.
Mm.<eos> Dislodging the clot.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Jamming the stent, or...<eos> Oh, damn it.<eos> The basilar wall is dissecting.<eos> It's just too weak.<eos> If you don't place the stent, it could rupture, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If we place it too fast...
- Shit, what crap reception!<eos> - Shit, what crap room service.<eos> Jeppe, I know why you came along, but Dad's not going to change.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - He lives in London.<eos> - You can't count on him.<eos> - The old man's still got it!<eos> I've got dinner sorted!<eos> Look.<eos> Fetch a rock, and I'll place it here. Now you smash its head in.

Now you smash its head in.<eos> - But it's still alive!<eos> - Yes, that's why you have to kill it.
Yeah, why doesn't everybody check their own car. - See if we find anything else.<eos> - Let's look at our cars. - Okay. - All right.<eos> After you.<eos> Is everyone nearby?<eos> We shouldn't spread out too much.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Everything okay?<eos> Yeah. I just... put this ring on that you got me at the fair.<eos> Remember?<eos> I know it's... I know it's cheesy, but I just wanted to have it on.
What age?<eos> 27 and a half.<eos> And in life... she's searching.<eos> A year ago, she got her history of art degree.<eos> Since then she's been searching, like all intellectuals.<eos> She'd like to earn a living writing about art.<eos> For now, she works in a gallery.<eos> Oh yes, by the way, she's called Amélie.<eos> And she hates her name.<eos> She thinks it's too nice.
Don't worry, I've got all the wood we'll need.<eos> Cute.<eos> Just, uh... you seem awfully quiet tonight.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I-I've just got a lot on my mind.<eos> Hmm, what is it, sweetie?<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> I don't know how to say this.<eos> Well, a problem shared is a problem halved.<eos> It's kind of like that fried rice, although I noticed you didn't touch your half, despite the fact that you had to order it, even though the white rice is free and the coupon specifically said "no substitutions."
Yes.<eos> Lyndsey broke up with Alan and he's having a hard time understanding.<eos> Oh, well, one look at the new guy and you'd understand it.<eos> What, you've seen him?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Nick's gorgeous.<eos> Kind of looks like Walden.<eos> Aw, thank you.<eos> Y-You know his name, so you-you've met him?<eos> Well, no, but I've heard her yell it.
If someone calls in a tip, you're gonna have the feds up your ass.<eos> This is fucking amateur hour.<eos> Really?<eos> You want to fly down here and take over?<eos> Because I would love that.<eos> All right.<eos> You listen to me, Avi.<eos> Unless you wanna get arrested or shot in the fucking head by a SWAT team, get them back tonight.<eos> Your back must get sore sitting in that computer chair all day.<eos> Want me to rub it?
Now, I have to do a few more tests, but at least three of those girls were treated for Strep.<eos> You're telling me that this pandas could have caused the ticking and not T.C.E. poisoning?<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> CNN called.<eos> They want to see if you'll do a live remote, talk about the case.<eos> Hell yes.<eos> Great.<eos> Dr. Pierce I flew you out here to support my case.<eos> Not undermine it.
Uh... (Keys jangle) Everything okay?<eos> Don't tell me you're not coming.<eos> Denise has been home with Christian all week.<eos> So bring him. Traci's bringing Leo.<eos> Christian is allergic to bees and trees and pollen and grass and...<eos> This is the last chance for us all to get together<eos> - before you go to Timmins. - Well, I... look, I'm so sorry.<eos> Look, you guys can still use my truck, though. (Whispers) Thank you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We don't need it.
I just haven't had the opportunity yet.<eos> All right, well... I already prepaid for popcorn, so... Here's hoping opportunity knocks.<eos> First shift back. How you feeling?<eos> (Sighs) Dov, how'd I get here? Uh, same as always.<eos> You know...<eos> Riverdale, Broadview, west on Gerrard... (Snickers)<eos> No. I mean here.<eos> This desk.<eos> Well, you asked Frank for your job back, and, uh...<eos> he gave it to you.
It's probably just the batteries, man.<eos> You gotta give 'em a spin.<eos> (Switch clicking) No, he's right.<eos> No power.<eos> Which also means no heat. Okay.<eos> That's...<eos> Yeah, that's no big deal.<eos> (Sighs) Come on, dudes, we're, uh, men.<eos> These are problems that men fix.<eos> If the generator is not working, then we will repair it.
I'm gonna say no.<eos> Alcohol?<eos> That is a big yes.<eos> Unless she gave that up, but I can't imagine<eos> - she would do that. - No, that's still a yes.<eos> (Chuckles) Last tetanus shot?<eos> No clue.<eos> Currently on any medication?<eos> (Huffs) Man, I don't know.<eos> Well, she has an inhaler, but she barely ever uses it.
But you used to?<eos> What are you thinking right now?<eos> I'm thinking about how different you are, before and after.<eos> I love the way you look at me when you're like this.<eos> But then I watch it decay.<eos> I can only hold your attention so long.<eos> Why is sex the definition of being close to someone?<eos> I don't know, but it is for me.<eos> It is for most people.<eos> Just because you climb a mountain doesn't mean you love it.
Mr. Draper?<eos> Yes, what is it?<eos> Do you need some water?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Bobby, go get your suitcase.<eos> - That's mine.<eos> - What about Gene's?<eos> I'm not going to pack his suitcase.<eos> I already did it.<eos> You just have to get it.

We would always try cool experiments.<eos> [GIRLS SNIFFLING]<eos> - Do you have any advice?<eos> - Any advice?<eos> On how we deal with this.<eos> I think your grief counselors can help with that.<eos> - And lean on each other. - Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know what this key is for?<eos> We found it in his pocket.
- Seeing anything?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Bumper's dinged and I think this is blood.<eos> FROST:<eos> So maybe we're looking for some kid who was fooling around in the Driver's Ed car.<eos> And ran over his teacher.<eos> CSRU started processing the car.<eos> They've already counted 170 separate prints.<eos> We'll never be able to tie that car to one driver.<eos> How many students learned to drive in it?
Hey, Frost.<eos> Can you run a DMV search on Mary Bigsby?<eos> - Is that Mary?<eos> - Think so.<eos> FROST:<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Mary Bigsby drives a blue minivan.<eos> I got the tags right here.<eos> We'll find it.
But con... Connor...<eos> Daniel...<eos> Murphy's already confessed to both murders.<eos> How did yit was all about the victimsshock value.<eos> He fits my profile exactly.<eos> Big into community theater, skydmng adrenaline junkie.<eos> Do you have any personal connection to the victims? Wha...<eos> What'd you do with the alligator suit?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I dumped it. Where?
Do you know why you do it?<eos> The thought comes into my head, and it won't leave me alone.<eos> Once, I ripped the antenna off a car and swallowed that.<eos> It's like I don't have a choice.<eos> I've been where you are.<eos> It's hard to know who to trust.<eos> We are on your side.<eos> We want to get you out of here.<eos> But you need to tell us what happened with the letter opener.<eos> I stole it.
But it doesn't change the fact that I love Kate.<eos> Well, that explains it.<eos> I have been working on him all weekend.<eos> Couldn't get him to break.<eos> let me guess...<eos> I'm off to a new hospital.<eos> Chicago General, actually, if that's okay with you. Did that when I was twelve.<eos> Well, now they have a surgical procedure that helps people with O.C.D.<eos> It's possible they can take away your compulsion, Erica.<eos> Take it away?
I know. From somebody special?<eos> Hey!<eos> Yeah, from Mr. Nunya -- nunya business.<eos> You here for a reason or you just wanted some office gossip?<eos> Not the water-cooler type.<eos> Could we have a moment, privately? Oh.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So...what's up?<eos> Powers passed the polygraph test.<eos> I administered it with an expert and I thought that might put your mind at ease.
We'll grieve for Anne and Lexie when she's dead.<eos> When we get there, I hope you let me do the honors.<eos> That's good.<eos> Use that.<eos> That'll see you through.<eos> I got to go talk to Colonel Weaver.<eos> Dad, what are you saying?<eos> You told me that if all we had left was hate, they'd already changed us.<eos> I know, Ben, but that was a long time ago.<eos> Right now, all I've got is hate, and I don't plan on wasting it.
What else we got on this guy?<eos> He scored all fives on his evals last year, highest marks.<eos> Same on his physical readiness test.<eos> The Navy may have bigger plans for him.<eos> His contract's up in six months.<eos> He'll be free to go.<eos> Can you find out if he's taken any other tests?<eos> Academic or PST exams?<eos> I will, although it seems like getting into a barroom brawl on shore leave is not very prudent for someone with further military aspirations.<eos> Jack didn't start that fight, but he was willing to finish it.
Come here.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Why are we stopping here?<eos> I told you, this area is restricted.<eos> Sailors aren't supposed to be here.<eos> When did the Navy outlaw pastrami?<eos> See that phone booth?<eos> Just watch.<eos> The Mayor know about this place?<eos> If he did, vice would have to shut it down.
The important moments.<eos> The moments that tested you.<eos> The moments that made you who you are.<eos> April, you're getting married.<eos> Unless I'm not.<eos> I just heard.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know about my life flashing before me.<eos> I was thinking about my white coat... and how I'm glad I have it on me now.
- Yeah.<eos> Did you hear the news about me being a big slut got out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's mortifying.<eos> But, you know, I mean, I think that...<eos> I think that we're gonna be okay.<eos> You know, I-I think...<eos> I think it's gonna make us stronger.<eos> You know, like a bone.<eos> You know, sometimes you... you have to... you have to break it in order for it to heal correctly.
Well, maybe this guy can help.<eos> All right, Sasha, we just got your studies back, and this is necrotizing fasciitis.<eos> It is aggressive, and we need to get you up to surgery right away.<eos> How... how did I...<eos> Uh, the water and the mud that you were stuck in.<eos> Both of those are breeding grounds for this type of bacteria.<eos> - Well, wait...<eos> - It's a flesh-eating bacteria, all right?<eos> What's most important is that we get her prepped and ready right away. Let's go.<eos> A doctor puts on his white coat to save lives, defy death, but once he takes it off, he's vulnerable, just like anybody else.
Human.<eos> Ma'am...<eos> I'm Dr. Kepner.<eos> I worked on your husband.<eos> Would you like to see him?<eos> Okay.<eos> We're all gonna die.<eos> We don't get much say over how or when.<eos> His ring.<eos> Thought you'd want it back.
It won't happen again.<eos> I should fucking hope not. What about your van?<eos> Can I at least borrow your van?<eos> No, you can't borrow my van.<eos> Just for the weekend, to go up to the lake.<eos> Carrie, I can't. Virgil, please.<eos> I'm in trouble.<eos> Okay, fine. Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I just need it back first thing Monday morning.

Has anybody heard from Ed yet?<eos> He must be really upset.<eos> I know, isn't this fun?<eos> I wish I could've seen his face when he tried to cash in his ticket.<eos> I bet his eyebrows were all scrunched and he was all frowny and mad and... you know, pretty much just his regular face.<eos> I did it.<eos> I left my wife.<eos> Oh, my God. You did what?<eos> I decided to make the break before she could claim any of this baby.<eos> You didn't try to cash it in yet?
Okay.<eos> Nod when you can no longer hear the tone.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you hear anything?<eos> No.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You're experiencing conductive hearing loss, especially in your left ear.<eos> So what you are saying...<eos> the bass is there, but I just can't hear it.
To show me what you're capable of?<eos> You showed me that at the convent.<eos> England shows me that every time you attack our borders.<eos> You need to fear us here, at French court, because your being here angers us very much.<eos> You threaten me, but it is the English who are afraid.<eos> There are rumors... That your Queen is ill...<eos> And my cousin Elizabeth is the next in line for the throne.<eos> But many say she's illegitimate, bastard born.<eos> And say the next rightful heir to the English throne is you.<eos> But what if I don't want it?
- Get it out of me now!<eos> - Oh, my God, I'm sorry!<eos> - Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> - No, never do that!<eos> - Oh!<eos> I didn't do it!<eos> It was the wind!<eos> Don't take the object out.<eos> Depending on what it's hit, you could do more damage.
I'm glad to see this new, more serious side of you, son.<eos> - Very pleased.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Did you buy that bumper sticker?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Following up.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> It's what I do.<eos> So did you buy it?<eos> Uh, no, I made it.
Worse than I ever imagined.<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> Whoever you are, you don't need to do this.<eos> I know the Shop made you a slave, and they turned you into some--no!<eos> You helped me out in Columbia. I don't want to have to kill you.<eos> Now drop it.<eos> No.<eos> You want to offer me the chance to wreck my deal with the devil. It was never a fair deal.<eos> You don't have to honor it.<eos> You sure as hell don't have to die for it.
Of all the kisses I have ever gotten in my life, that was the first.<eos> Hey, you should ask her out, Moe.<eos> Ah, but she's sweet on the strong man.<eos> You're fine unless Rabbit Ears hears and tells Big Mouth.<eos> Wha...?<eos> ! I ain't got no chance with the strong man's girl.<eos> He makes ten dollars a week plus all the sawdust he can eat.<eos> Well, you've got an emerald ring.<eos> My mother's ring.<eos> She gave it to me on her deathbed.

Well, thank you very much, Mr... I don't know your last name.<eos> Now I know you just started dating my little girl, but she seems to think you're something special.<eos> Dad, you're embarrassing me.<eos> We're just friends and we're having some fun.<eos> It's not like we're getting married.<eos> Oh, my God, they're throwing the bouquet!<eos> How 'bout that? She dove for it.<eos> - What do you think, Charlie?<eos> Scary, right?<eos> I borrowed it from the bride.
Well, you know what?<eos> I've actually moved on with my life and things are working out pretty well.<eos> So no hard feelings, I forgive you.<eos> - Here's your ticket, sir.<eos> - Thank you. - You better hurry, they're boarding now.<eos> See, here's the thing... I don't forgive you.<eos> You ruined my life.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Okay, the computer.<eos> I'd like you to turn it on, turn it off, then turn it on again.
Thank you, Paloma.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> Sorry for the false alarm.<eos> It's just that I-I can't screw this up.<eos> Understood.<eos> So you have someone that can decode it?<eos> Friday night, your house.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can you hold on to it till then?
Now I can never go back.<eos> You know you're going to thank me.<eos> Just because your shift is over doesn't mean you can get undressed in the lobby.<eos> - Incredible.<eos> - What?<eos> He should greet you.<eos> How you doing today?<eos> I'm- - I got-- I left something.<eos> And I don't have my key.<eos> You mean you lost it already?
This is unacceptable and I'd like to know what you have to say for yourself.<eos> - Does this color look good on me?<eos> What would you like for me to say?<eos> Joan, you of all people can't plead ignorance.<eos> She's going to say something about her client and her connection.<eos> And, honestly, I take no issue with that.<eos> But what we have here is a breach of the fundamental rules of this business.<eos> An account executive signs business and they send their junior to maintain it.<eos> To maintain their boss's relationship.<eos> The entire thing falls apart if I send you to the store to get cake and you eat it on the way home.
I was an orphan.<eos> I grew up in Pennsylvania... in a whorehouse.<eos> I read about Milton Hershey and his school in "Coronet" magazine or some other crap the girls left by the toilet.<eos> And I read that some orphans had a different life there.<eos> I could picture it.<eos> I dreamt of it-- of being wanted.<eos> Because the woman who was forced to raise me would look at me every day like she hoped I would disappear.<eos> Closest I got to feeling wanted was from a girl who made me go through her john's pockets while they screwed.<eos> If I collected more than a dollar, she'd buy me a Hershey bar.<eos> And I would eat it alone in my room with great ceremony... feeling like a normal kid.
What are you doing?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Wilfred!<eos> Wilfred!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Wilfred!<eos> What?<eos> I thought you had drowned.<eos> Nah.<eos> Just trying to save the evidence, but I couldn't find it.
Maybe you killed it with your "bone" jokes, or maybe it died this morning when I walked in on my son masturbating.<eos> Or, oh, most likely it was murdered when I remembered that today is the day that Steve proposed to me, oh, so many years ago.<eos> Okay, firstly, walking in on your son wanking... Hysterical.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> Okay, maybe it's a little funny.<eos> And, second, I knew Steve was lame, but he proposed to you on your mom's stupid fake holiday?<eos> Yes.<eos> I hope he had a really good ring.<eos> It was a blade of grass.<eos> I still have it.

Clean skins.<eos> He's been putting their people into the system.<eos> Fake IDs, but he tagged them somehow.<eos> Michael, we have your meds and we're on our way.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Michael?<eos> - Leo, look...<eos> - Nothing to say.<eos> We're, all of us, under massive pressure.<eos> Look, if this smallpox virus is at the Drezna facility, then a frontal assault could be dangerous, suicidal, even, if they decide to use it.
I'm going to the bathroom.<eos> Charlie, hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> Hey, Sean, what are you doing here?<eos> It was a rough night.<eos> Took a beating.<eos> But then I remembered you were bringing Jen out so I figured I'd come join you guys. Are these your sliders?<eos> Can I have these?<eos> Yeah, sure... if you tell Jen about the escort thing.<eos> I'm not gonna do that because that is ancient history and I already touched this slider, so I'm gonna eat it.
Okay?<eos> It's all the same, Lily.<eos> You can stop that talk right there.<eos> It's just a cigarette.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> We got roni sticks for days.<eos> Years, probably.<eos> You see that big truck parked outside?<eos> Come on, dude, the Gorbelli food truck.<eos> Ray Charles could have seen it.
I'm sorry.<eos> He could have got me.<eos> He almost got me.<eos> I was thinking he would have been grateful or whatever that you stopped him, from him-- you know what I mean?<eos> So, yeah, we're cool.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> No.<eos> - We're coming with you.<eos> - No.<eos> There has to be someplace better, and you're gonna help us find it.
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...<eos> I've been on the road for a couple of months.<eos> By yourself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got a name?<eos> Brian Heriot.<eos> There has to be some place better and you're gonna help us find it.
Well, they're with bad people.<eos> Am I?<eos> I'm gonna keep you alive.<eos> I'm gonna keep Megan alive.<eos> The only judgment on me I care about is whether you two are still breathing.<eos> It's good that you heard, that you know.<eos> Lily...<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> Hey, you told me there has to be someplace better and that I was gonna help you find it.
"Schmidt happens."<eos> You're a Schmidt head.<eos> I hired you to be my assistant to help you out financially 'cause you had close your chiropractic office.<eos> I didn't have to close it;<eos> I'm in a rent dispute.<eos> People in rent disputes don't fake their own death.<eos> (doorbell rings) Oh, I'll get that.<eos> You are looking good today, boss.<eos> That's why he got good toilet paper.<eos> So my ass is clean while he's kissing it.
Be a superhero.<eos> Fuck the tortoise, Alex.<eos> Right!<eos> Here we go, look, clean clothes.<eos> You're gonna be beating 'em off with a shitty stick, you are.<eos> There you go.<eos> All right, let's get...<eos> What the frigging hell are you wearing?<eos> My jumper.<eos> Maggie made it for me.

Fuck me. That's what... that's what it is.<eos> It's because I love you.<eos> - You love me?<eos> - Yeah. I love you like I loved Peter Rabbit.<eos> And that's why my cock won't frigging work.<eos> I have a really sarcastic penis.<eos> Do you mean you have an ironic penis?<eos> Is that what you mean?<eos> What you on about?<eos> The bend in it? That's from when Saunders slammed it into a door.
No, you couldn't, because of your new jeans.<eos> I know. Sorry.<eos> I... I was a massive twat.<eos> But I have been the Good fucking Samaritan with bells on.<eos> Lesson learned.<eos> So, are you... are you gonna lift the curse or what?<eos> Two bottles of white wine, and we'll call it quits.<eos> Well, go on, then.<eos> Lift the curse.<eos> I took it off when you came round to my flat that time.
You know, the thing is, Lavon, what if Peter is imaginary?<eos> What-what do you mean?<eos> You-you got the address.<eos> I know, but... we had a magical night, but what if... that's all it was supposed to be is just a wonderful memory?<eos> Meatball!<eos> If you want to get Lemon's attention, I think I know how you can.<eos> ♪ The cutest guy, the cutest guy... ♪ - You wrote a song about me?<eos> - Yes, about how much I hate you.<eos> I don't know why everyone finds that so romantic.<eos> Okay, so, you wrote it right after you found me with Wade in May.
- lt's Orcs and all that, right?<eos> - Orcs?<eos> Those action figures you use in role play.<eos> So close, yet so far... lt's like being both an actor and a model, like Paris Hilton.<eos> A role model is someone you'd like to be like.<eos> A person you look up to.<eos> Not necessarily a star, just someone with characteristics you admire.<eos> Rich bitches with sex tapes plastered all over the internet don't qualify.<eos> I want you all to think of a role model.<eos> Write an essay and present it in class.
I've been tracking down my missing RV.<eos> Toby gave it to "A," but Spencer already knew that.
- No, it doesn't go with my meal.<eos> - I'm sorry about this morning.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Come on. Let me buy you a drink.<eos> It'll be like old times.<eos> Why are you suddenly being so nice to me now?<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I only came by to give you these.<eos> - Now you're giving me my car back?<eos> - DCU doesn't need it anymore.

KANG Chang-sik?<eos> Similarities of our cases can't be coincidental.<eos> - I was at the archive... - Shit.<eos> It's him.<eos> What?<eos> He chose noon for the exchange.<eos> Yongsan station, platform #5, under column #4, $50,000 in a duffle bag.<eos> Walk a little slower.<eos> Yes, that's good.<eos> Place it upright so we can see it.
Captain, it's me.<eos> At the time, the exchange was Yongsan at noon.<eos> - Yongsan, noon.<eos> - Yes, he ordered the ransom in the duffle bag he sent...<eos> - In the duffle bag? - Yes.<eos> Wait!<eos> Hello?<eos> Got the duffle bag I sent?<eos> $50,000, today at noon, Yongsan station, platform #5, 4th column.<eos> Drop it off yourself and walk away.
Why won't he...?<eos> Someone has taken out the brain.<eos> Hi, I want to have ownership information on a company : Eischer Transhumanology.<eos> I have the registration number here: 593185-9303.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Drive me home.<eos> Hello, Einar.<eos> It is Tobias.<eos> I have a small question only.<eos> If one were to find David Eischers code, how would you recognize it?
- Where did Vera go?<eos> - To a theme park.<eos> Here... "Hub Battle Land".<eos> It seems a bit funny to be named that.<eos> Mimi!<eos> Remember when Mom gave you a note from Leo?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Is it still here?<eos> No.<eos> I memorized it.
It seems a bit funny to be named that.<eos> Mimi!<eos> Remember when Mom gave you a note from Leo?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Is it still here?<eos> No.<eos> I memorized it.<eos> What was on it?<eos> It was a part of David Eischers code, right?<eos> David called it the "key", but it is useless on its own.
Anyway...<eos> We would like to borrow the "key".<eos> - Do you understand what the code does?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - It made you.<eos> - And what am I?<eos> - You are amazing.<eos> - No.<eos> Forget the code, Tobbe.<eos> Do not possess it.
Hello?<eos> Hi.<eos> I here to pickup a unit.<eos> - Is there anything you like?<eos> - Hell no.<eos> Silas sent me to retrieve a Hub.<eos> That's the one.<eos> We would have extended the contract.<eos> Silas didn't want to.<eos> He ​​wants it himself.
Any of the guys you're considering can do the job, but unless you're planning on being impeached or getting a stroke,<eos> I don't think we have to worry about it.<eos> In the last two years, I've been kidnapped, tortured, shot, implanted with an eye worm.<eos> Last week, I was almost torn apart by a harnessed kid and contaminated by a nuclear reactor.<eos> I think we can count on something happening, don't you?<eos> - Dan.<eos> - Tom.<eos> I thought I was supposed to have Anthony's report on that investigation on my desk yesterday.<eos> I talked to him this morning.<eos> You'll have it by the end of the day.
- No, no, you're not coming.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, I'll give you my Wi-Fi code.<eos> You have three minutes.<eos> What about movie night?<eos> Well, just stay and, you know, finish watching the film. And, you know, whatever you want.<eos> - Use the hot tub if you like. All right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Don't heat it up, though, 'cause it honestly costs a fortune.
- Everyone, this is Jessica.<eos> - Hi.<eos> We campaigned for Obama together.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Oh, I'm really good.<eos> Let's go. All the girls here are stuck up.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Margo... I love, love your skirt.<eos> - Is it one of yours?<eos> - I wish. Marc Jacobs loaned it to me. I never gave it back.
Yeah, originally it was "When does a black man become a ni..."<eos> Gosh, I don't remember what it was.<eos> I think you should leave.<eos> No, I honestly don't think you're listening to my point.<eos> Please go.<eos> It was a pleasure meeting you.<eos> Sorry about the... you know, getting thrown out of the hot tub and everything.<eos> Well, I'm sorry about the tap dancing.<eos> Why haven't I seen it before?<eos> - I was just saving it up. - Wow.
Their hatred of Madame is their hatred of themselves?<eos> Obviously.<eos> Please get back into your positions.<eos> Firstly, it is a rite. It must be as tragic as possible.<eos> This is Racine.<eos> The women don't achieve their ends, they destroy themselves.<eos> Look at her gloves.<eos> These are not any old gloves.<eos> It is a rubber glove.<eos> It must be at the heart of your preoccupations, Yvette.
You want to talk about how she does business?<eos> Let's talk about how you do business.<eos> Your Honor, I have a list of 87 murder cases that Cameron Dennis tried as a D.A.<eos> In each instance, he allowed reasonable bail to be set.<eos> I allowed bail because gangbangers don't have a fraction of Ms. Hessington's resources.<eos> You allowed bail because you didn't give a damn about those guys, and this is personal.<eos> It's why you took the case, it's why you hid a witness, and it's why you negotiated a settlement in bad faith.<eos> My chambers now.<eos> You bring an accusation like that into my courtroom, you better be able to back it up.<eos> Your Honor, when I told him he took this case to stick it to me, he said, quote, "I did, and now I got her, and you didn't see it coming."

Oh, perfect timing.<eos> Harvey, I was just gonna run something by you.<eos> I don't have time, Louis. I'm working on a murder case.<eos> I just dropped by to inform you Mike's coming with you to see Gianopolous.<eos> Like hell he is.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I'm not taking anyone.<eos> - Louis--<eos> - And don't Louis me.<eos> This is my case, and you've been sticking your nose in it ever since I got it.

Mr. Nesbitt gave us all gifts.<eos> And they're funny?<eos> I think they're meant to be.<eos> Well, you know, he has trouble connecting, but he's making an effort.<eos> Maybe he took my words to heart.<eos> What'd you say to him?<eos> Turned out quite well.<eos> - You crossed a line.<eos> - I did no such thing.<eos> You took a private feud, and you made it public.
I didn't want you freaking out.<eos> Well, I'm definitely coming with you now, and the only way you can stop me is with that bat.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> - It's the Mackenzie file--<eos> - I know what it is.<eos> What the hell did you put in the fine print?<eos> You too?<eos> You're gonna give me shit about not disclosing this report?<eos> Not disclosing it?

You get to prove you're the better man in front of our associates.<eos> You agree to hand her back the moment the verdict is in?<eos> I agree to let you say good-bye to her the moment that you're defeated.<eos> Whatever the hell that means.<eos> Glad to see you haven't lost your touch with the clients.<eos> I don't have to be nice to her.<eos> I just have to clean up after her bullshit.<eos> She didn't lie.<eos> She just made a mistake.<eos> We still have to clean it up.
I was wondering when you'd find out.<eos> Save it.<eos> I thought when I got rid of Daniel Hardman, I was done with partners I couldn't trust.<eos> I assume you're referring to Harvey because I'm not the one who proposed that deal.<eos> Him asking isn't the same as you accepting.<eos> No, it isn't, but he was going to quit because of you.<eos> And that deal made him stay.<eos> And as you said yourself, he is essential to the firm.<eos> Not more essential than me.<eos> And as for your deal with Harvey, it doesn't exist because he doesn't want it anymore.
Tell me you didn't talk to Kent.<eos> Kent?<eos> Of course not.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> Charles Goodson.<eos> I told you I would destroy you, and I will.<eos> You know, we might have bumped into each other somewhere.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I have taken over your TV.<eos> You haven't really taken it over.
- I said be careful.<eos> No, no, you have to put it all in one sentence.<eos> Like, "Be careful, he's a hacker for the CIA."<eos> Behold, I am your whole screen.<eos> Say good-bye, Kent.<eos> There's nothing you can do.<eos> I will torment you forever.<eos> - I got all the time in the world.<eos> - Shut up, punk.<eos> I've got a circuit breaker and I know how to use it.
No dander.<eos> But if she had a histamine reaction, doesn't that mean that she inhaled the hair?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And since she was still breathing, the hair wasn't in the water.<eos> It means the hair could have been on the killer.<eos> Maybe the killer had a German shepherd.<eos> The root ball's still intact.<eos> I could test the dog hair.<eos> Find out if the dog was on any medication.<eos> - That might help us identify it.
- Philippe, someone to see you.<eos> - Search everywhere.<eos> We're taking you in for infiltrating a data system, receiving stolen goods, theft, criminal damage and industrial espionage.<eos> You know, we deal with runaways, divorce, detective work in matters of the heart.<eos> That's right, isn't it?<eos> My first sex tape.<eos> Is it legal to film the staff?<eos> If they're warned by their employers.<eos> My USB stick.<eos> I've been looking for it everywhere.

I'm glad I didn't use it in the office.
You'll just have pocket money.<eos> I want to know where you are, what you do.<eos> And stop seeing the others.<eos> They scare me.<eos> They scare you too.<eos> Do you have your papers or not?<eos> You mean a passport?<eos> Yes, a passport, a visa...<eos> I have a passport.<eos> We'll need it.
No one's allowed to talk.<eos> Everybody's looking at me, I gotta go.<eos> Well?<eos> Okay, you're right.<eos> But what does it tell you?<eos> That she's embarrassed, ashamed, and doesn't want to admit it's even happening.<eos> That she's in a relationship with me!<eos> Isn't this place great?<eos> Yeah, I mean, it's the middle of nowhere.<eos> How did you find it?
- You think so?<eos> - Beautiful soldier...<eos> - I am who I am.<eos> Don't push me...<eos> You prefer to talk?<eos> I used to know what I wanted.<eos> Suddenly everything has become so complicated.<eos> Avalanches falling in on me from all sides.<eos> Where is the fish?<eos> Hold it!
I'm gonna go tell Mom about the horse.<eos> Okay.<eos> You'd better hurry! (Or) I'm gonna eat your sandwich!<eos> Hey Mom, I know what I want for my...<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> We're leaving.<eos> I packed your suitcase.<eos> It's upstairs in your room.<eos> Go get it and bring it downstairs.
My tattoo's real.<eos> It's gonna be there forever.<eos> And it's not even Tinker Bell wearing a cowboy hat, which is what I always wanted.<eos> We can go back and you can get that one and I'll get a real one just like you.<eos> You think I want you walking around like some slut with a tattoo on the back of your neck?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> ( Knocks ) Ready for lunch?<eos> It is gorgeous outside.<eos> I just saw a dove kissing a butterfly.<eos> He was probably eating it.
I think they were possessed, and now those soldiers are.<eos> Hey.<eos> Excuse me, agents.<eos> We pulled this off a security camera.<eos> You might want to take a look.<eos> Abaddon?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Thought you Kentucky fried that meatsuit.<eos> I did, Dean.<eos> You -- well, then, how did she get it back?
Are we gonna fight or make out?<eos> 'Cause I'm getting some real mixed signals here.<eos> I want Crowley -- or what's left of him.<eos> Yeah? What's in it for me?<eos> I let you die.<eos> You give me Crowley's head, and I will snap your neck quick and clean.<eos> You won't feel a thing, trust me.<eos> And if I tell you to get bent?<eos> Oh.<eos> You know, I've loved this body since the moment I first saw it.
Turns out he's only half crazy.<eos> You've exposed hypocrisy of politicians and corporations.<eos> But the real enemy here is the police.<eos> They are the jackboot on the throat of free citizens.<eos> We don't need anyone.<eos> Tell me what you want me to do.<eos> I want you to bring this city to its knees.<eos> I was wrong about Julian.<eos> He's not inciting the terror.<eos> He's masterminding it!
Yeah, actually, I'm a pretty natural athlete.<eos> Oh, really? What do you say we go outside<eos> - and play a little basketball?<eos> I'm in. No, not you.<eos> Just me and Canvas.<eos> One-on-one.<eos> You wanna borrow my knee brace?<eos> I don't need your stupid knee brace.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Keep it handy, just in case.
- That's a really good college.<eos> - He's a hard worker.<eos> - Getting straight A's.<eos> - Dad.<eos> Father, is everything okay up at the church?<eos> I saw police.<eos> Do you use aglime on the church grounds?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where do you keep it?<eos> I'd like to see it.
Are you sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> ___<eos> Why do guys cheat?<eos> ___<eos> Why did you cheat on me?<eos> ___<eos> ___<eos> How can it mean nothing?<eos> Sex is a big deal, and you don't just have it with someone else because you're in a bad mood, or, you're in a fight with your dad or you're being sent overseas.
Cara, you do realize you are searching through John's personal property?<eos> And according to New York Penal Code Article 14010...<eos> Tim, don't be that guy.<eos> You want to make yourself useful?<eos> Help me find the D chip.<eos> You're referring to John's D chip?<eos> End cabinet, second drawer, small wooden box.<eos> The chip is inside.<eos> I don't imagine John will be pleased to part with this.<eos> Someone needs it more than we do.
We got a pair of aces.<eos> If the jury believes that Cameron's got three of a kind, we're not gonna win.<eos> We can't go after Stephen.<eos> Cameron won't go after Ava if I can convince him it was Stephen.<eos> - You went to Cameron? - Yes.<eos> And you're going to trust him?<eos> I'm not sure we have another choice.<eos> If you're thinking what I think you're thinking, don't.<eos> I'm thinking I'd like to rip your face off.<eos> You get Mariga to point the finger at me, I will point it straight at Ava.
We were together all the time.<eos> Not once did we get on each other's nerves.<eos> Not once did we get bored.<eos> Wouldn't it be better to keep the fuel for something else?<eos> What's up?<eos> There's a smell.<eos> Of what?<eos> Water.<eos> The pool was like a gift to us from the war.<eos> We accepted it without feeling bad. We were due it.
There's a smell.<eos> Of what?<eos> Water.<eos> The pool was like a gift to us from the war.<eos> We accepted it without feeling bad. We were due it.<eos> I'd never felt time fly like it did that day.<eos> So, I thanked the pool for appearing before us.<eos> This is no good.<eos> That pool's ours.<eos> No one must find it.
Nice? !<eos> Eh, Dom, it's nice? !<eos> Did you see him do that?<eos> Eyes blindfolded as well!<eos> Make the most of it.<eos> We're leaving...<eos> Tomorrow night.<eos> News of the departure hit us hard.<eos> We walked aimlessly for hours.<eos> We all thought about the pool, but no one wanted to see it as sad as us.
I'm going to eat.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> - Watch out for the penguin, sir!<eos> - No, I see it.<eos> You already hit the penguin.<eos> Listen to me, you're going to fix that penguin, bro.<eos> Whether you like it or not, believe me, you're gonna fix it.<eos> Nope.<eos> I mean, if I was fixing it, you'd see me fixing it, but... I'm not fixing it.<eos> Did you notice how I wasn't fixing it?
- You understand?<eos> - One second.<eos> I'm gonna say it...<eos> Am not, am not!<eos> - You're gonna fix this fucking thing.<eos> - Nope, nope.<eos> You gotta ask yourself, "What leverage do I have?"<eos> Not much!<eos> You're a fucking jerkoff, you know that?<eos> -"You're gonna fix that penguin!" -"No, you're gonna fix it!"

So I explained to my little brother that forgiveness cannot be bought.<eos> I'd simply prefer to see a change in behavior that indicates contrition and personal growth not this nonsense.<eos> Well, I couldn't very well let her go to waste, could I?<eos> Well, I suppose I'll fetch the rubbish bin because she's staining a ZOO-year-old carpet.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> "I was angry with my friend.<eos> I told my wrath, my wrath did end.<eos> I was angry with my foe.<eos> I told it not, my wrath did grow.<eos> And I water'd it in fears, night and morning with my tears.

It didn't bother me at all.<eos> That's the problem. That's why I'm here.<eos> I've slept like a baby every night this week, even though my twin brother hacked nine priests to death not two feet from this confessional.<eos> A guy I've been seeing, Marcel, has been blowing me off.<eos> I've gone on two dates with the guy, and I'm more upset about that than seeing "murderer" scrawled across my brother's grave.<eos> It's called healing, Cami.<eos> For months after the massacre,<eos> I couldn't think of anything else, and then suddenly, nothing.<eos> I need to feel that pain.<eos> Without it, I feel broken, empty, like there's someone to blame and I'm letting them get away with it.
I don't care who he is or what the rumors say.<eos> He needed to be taught a lesson.<eos> You are gonna start a war.<eos> I'd like to see then try, oh, and, Kieran, this is the last time you call a meeting.<eos> Next time you want to criticize our leadership, send a damn e-mail.<eos> I thought you called this meeting.<eos> The hell we did.<eos> Actually, I called it.<eos> It appears I made a grave error during our earlier conference.<eos> My friend Marcel offered me wise counsel, and I failed to heed it.
I still can't believe my mother chose to trot Patrick out yesterday.<eos> Well, I'm sure she had her reasons.<eos> Why do I even care?<eos> My parents are rotten human beings who continually disappoint me.<eos> And yet I have this innate need to protect them.<eos> Because despite everything, they're your family.<eos> And when someone comes along and threatens that bond, you'll do anything to defend it.<eos> Is that why you haven't mentioned the job- because it's in the city?<eos> - The job?<eos> You should take it, Daniel.
He's in Los Angeles!<eos> I guess I have to call the police and tell them I'm being stalked by Cyril.<eos> Or I could just talk to a cop who comes out of Wood's bedroom in his underwear.<eos> Good Morning.<eos> Hey.<eos> I just got a call from Marcus.<eos> Whatever he said, I deny it!<eos> Detective...<eos> Mo Kapoor was picked up for questioning.<eos> He admitted the ball stretcher was purchased by him but he claims he bought it for his boss Elliot Butler who needed to be discreet because he's running for office.
Maybe like the time he and Boyd tried to kill you.<eos> How'd you know about that?<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Why are you even talking to me?<eos> I helped kill your friend.<eos> How do you know I'm not gonna kill another one?<eos> Is he looking at me?<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> You know what I'm gonna do?<eos> I'm going to break off an extra large branch of Mountain ash, wrap it in wolfsbane, roll it in mistletoe, and shove it up your freaking... whoa, Stiles, okay.
Is that so?<eos> You have a soft spot for him.<eos> I have an investment I'm trying to mature.<eos> If you want to talk about soft spots, let's talk about Jennifer Blake.<eos> Or... what was her name again?<eos> Julia.<eos> Ah.<eos> Julia Baccari. That was my name.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I guess I should have changed it to something with different first letters.
Maybe.<eos> I told Cora I wouldn't leave.<eos> I'll help the others when I figure out how to help her.<eos> There's no time!<eos> The full moon's coming.<eos> The sheriff and Melissa are gonna be dead, so I'm gonna try and help them.<eos> You can sit here and perfect the art of doing nothing.<eos> I wouldn't take it personally.<eos> Anger is just a tool.<eos> He's using it to excuse shifting allegiance from one Alpha to another.
They blame you.<eos> I tried to speak on your behalf, but they wouldn't listen. I have to go.<eos> The pod is waiting. No.<eos> Please, Aquata, don't leave me!<eos> I'm sorry, Sirena.<eos> Here. Take this.<eos> Your moon ring...<eos> I... I don't know how to use it.<eos> Just... take it.<eos> You may need it.
No problem.<eos> - I'll come back.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Tell the board we're meeting tomorrow.<eos> Sure thing, Mr. Kruger.<eos> Quite a stunt you pulled with the baby rattle.<eos> I'd have told you about it, but you'd have tried to talk me out of it.<eos> You're right.<eos> We need this deal.<eos> Well, we just got it.
You were with him when he unleashed the spell. You know how the angels were cast down!<eos> I didn't know he was assembling a spell. I only knew that I was the final ingredient.<eos> You?<eos> My Grace.<eos> That's why I'm human.<eos> He took my Grace for the spell.<eos> Or you gave it.<eos> It may be unwise to kill me.<eos> If my Grace were the key to empowering the spell,<eos> I may be key to countering it.
Little birdie told us.<eos> Ring any bells, Dorothy?<eos> Unfortunately.<eos> It's the Key to Oz.<eos> There are magical ways into Oz.<eos> Tornado, eye of a hurricane, whirlpool.<eos> But this key will turn any locked door into a portal to Oz.<eos> Insert the Key, twist, and presto, you're in Oz.<eos> Well, how did the Men of Letters get the key?<eos> I have no idea, but if she finds it, she'll go back and finish what she started.
I would've chosen you!<eos> If only you asked.<eos> Maybe we could've found a way to be a family again.<eos> We can be.<eos> Bae.<eos> Bae!<eos> Tell me what I have to do to gain your trust, and I will.<eos> Give me The Dark One dagger.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you wouldn't come all the way to Neverland without it.
Bae.<eos> Bae!<eos> Tell me what I have to do to gain your trust, and I will.<eos> Give me The Dark One dagger.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you wouldn't come all the way to Neverland without it.<eos> It's the only thing that can control you.<eos> It's the only thing that could stop you.<eos> You wouldn't take any chances with it.<eos> - I don't have it.

We're mermaids.<eos> Same as me?<eos> Well, wouldn't exactly call you a 'mermaid'. Shut up, Nixie.<eos> Yes. What happened to you was an accident.<eos> I levelled about me.<eos> But you've been lying this whole time?<eos> You've known from the start.<eos> And all that stuff about keeping me away from here, you knew I'd come and you followed?<eos> We had to keep you away from the trident.<eos> So I wouldn't get it?
You got an address?<eos> Check your inbox.<eos> McLoving you long-distance.<eos> Bullets give us anything, Abbs?<eos> Um, standard .308<eos> Winchesters.<eos> Anyone could buy them online.<eos> And there's nothing to tie them to this... stupid Brotherhood of Doubt thing.<eos> The name is such a downer.<eos> I don't even like saying it.
Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.<eos> You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.<eos> Okay.<eos> So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they're adorable.<eos> It was better when you couldn't talk to women.<eos> I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.<eos> Oh, brain lesions are fascinating.<eos> Unless they're yours, then they're a drag.<eos> To the advancement of science.<eos> And to the sick and dying who make it possible.
How about I go first?<eos> But I don't want to know how many underpants you own.<eos> Although, based on the floor of your bedroom,<eos> Okay, look, here's something people do not know about me.<eos> When I first moved out to L.A.,<eos> I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla.<eos> Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed.<eos> Thankfully, that thing never came out.<eos> Yeah. Serial Apeist.<eos> Howard found it online the day we met you. Oh, God...
- And a toothbrush.<eos> Um, are you coming out with us later?<eos> I have a work dinner, but I'm gonna meet up with you after, yeah.<eos> Um, did she mention why we're going out later?<eos> Yeah, her final hurrah.<eos> Well, there's that reason, but there's...<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> - Yeah, there's another reason as well, - which she's aware of.<eos> - Cool.<eos> I'll tell you what it is. It's that I'm, um...
We talked on the phone today?<eos> You called and asked me if we found Stefan and if Katherine was safe.<eos> I told you where we were headed.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Yeah, yeah. I remember.<eos> Can I call you back tomorrow? Ok.<eos> Well, he's got his daylight ring back.<eos> We're all set for a picnic.<eos> He's lucky he has a brother who looks out for him.<eos> Otherwise, you might have pawned it for a pinball machine.
Dash?<eos> Season 1, Episode 3 "Today I Am a Witch"<eos> - Can't sleep?<eos> - Bad dream.<eos> You?<eos> I'm just looking through some old spells, trying to find inspiration for our shifter problem.<eos> - Any luck?<eos> - Let me guess...<eos> You're worried about the price for the resurrection spell.<eos> Maybe we could find a way to reverse it so no one has to die.
Okay, concentrate.<eos> Come on, Freya, Ingrid can empty a freaking lake.<eos> You can do this.<eos> Wow. You really are a klutz.<eos> It's kind of adorable.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - I work here.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Roger was very impressed with my skills behind the bar.<eos> He offered me a job, and I took it.
Don't worry, ladies, it's almost over.<eos> Season 1, Episode 9 "A Parching Imbued"<eos> What's happening?<eos> - Oh, we found a spell.<eos> - To get my powers back?<eos> No, but it'll help us work out who the shifter is.<eos> - How?<eos> - Oh, what does that mean?<eos> - Just think of it as DNA evidence.<eos> Exactly, so the shifter's fingerprint may still be traceable in your blood, so we're gonna try and draw it out.
Even the one pointing directly at his apartment?<eos> Taxi!<eos> Where you going?<eos> Up.<eos> Hey!<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Keep your vehicle perfectly still, I'll give you $20 for going absolutely nowhere.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Signal jumper.<eos> Someone's been using it to hijack that camera's video feed, broadcast it to a remote location.
I don't know, I--I swear!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> ! I thought you were done killing people!<eos> He'll live.<eos> Yeah, but he'll report me to my lieutenant!<eos> He won't talk to anyone.<eos> What makes you so sure? Because he has another shoulder.<eos> Oh, ok, ok, ok!<eos> There--there is another place.<eos> He was always drawing it.
Oh. Patrick, under normal circumstances, I would never tell you what to do or who to see.<eos> But when it comes to Mr. Ross and Miss Thorne--<eos> Believe me, I didn't realize they were friends until just now.<eos> Well, they are, and they're thick as thieves.<eos> - Still no word from Charlotte?<eos> - Well, I phoned.<eos> And yesterday I drove out to the Stowaway to see her, but then I thought better of it.<eos> Ah, I thought of writing her a letter, but I couldn't... hold the pen.<eos> Would you mind?<eos> Well, if you want, I'll write it for you.
P.M. delivery. A.M. delivery is a scam, Sheila.<eos> It gets there at the same time anyway.<eos> Okay, you know what's a scam?<eos> This letter, which I am now ripping up.<eos> No! Sheila, please!<eos> [Papers ripping] I labored over every word of that.<eos> The time for words is over.<eos> The time for deeds is now.<eos> Well, then give me a deed, I'll do it.<eos> Give me a mountain, I'll climb it.

Have you seen Lyla?<eos> She left about an hour ago.<eos> Did she say where she was going, or what she was doing?<eos> She wanted information about Mako.<eos> I told you.<eos> I knew it.<eos> What is this all about?<eos> Lyla wanted to borrow my moon ring... ..and I said no.<eos> My moon ring's gone.<eos> It's OK, we're gonna get it back.
I knew it.<eos> What is this all about?<eos> Lyla wanted to borrow my moon ring... ..and I said no.<eos> My moon ring's gone.<eos> It's OK, we're gonna get it back.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> How did she know you even had one?<eos> She was asking about the land entrance to the moon pool on Mako.<eos> Is that what it's for?<eos> She thought she'd use a moon ring to try and open it.
I never saw you.<eos> Women's fashion. Let's call them.<eos> Only bankers can rent this room?<eos> No farmers, no food!<eos> "Own toilets."<eos> "Charmingly quaint."<eos> I would put you up but we're already squashed.<eos> I know.<eos> So?<eos> Now we have a lift, you might as well use it.
Strange about the watch, though.<eos> What watch?<eos> Mrs McNaster, I was hoping to speak with your son.<eos> Do you know when he's available? Oh, Gerald arrived home ages ago.<eos> He's in the study.<eos> He's still looking for the mould, I imagine. Mould?<eos> Well, I reminded him he took a cast of the Spanish doubloon.<eos> You know, the coin the police are hanging onto.<eos> So that would be proof of ownership?<eos> Yes, but he seems to have lost track of it.
We got the water back up to full heat, but even then it wasn't enough to burn skin.<eos> And his feet were hanging off the ground, in any case.<eos> It's a conundrum.<eos> What about cause of death?<eos> We're still waiting on the full autopsy, but preliminary examination points to strangulation, no broken neck.<eos> But these marks indicate a rope.<eos> If it was a rope that killed him, how did he come to be hanging by a scarf?<eos> Assuming we're dealing with a suicide, Harper throws a rope...<eos> Yet to be found.<eos> Ties it off at the tap, climbs up, kicks the stool out, hangs himself.
Unfortunately, my companion, Dorothy Williams, has a terrible reaction to Scotty's hair.<eos> Maybe she should just keep her distance.<eos> But she also had a terrible reaction to my gloves, after I touched the West Melbourne scarf that was tied around Harry Harper's neck.<eos> Perhaps I... I just patted Scotty, and then I touched that scarf.<eos> You didn't go anywhere near that scarf after Harry Harper's body was found.<eos> Did you murder him, before you tied the scarf around his neck?<eos> No!<eos> You'd better explain, then.<eos> One of the younger blokes stole the scarf from West sheds.<eos> I gave it to Scotty to sleep on.
Did you murder him, before you tied the scarf around his neck?<eos> No!<eos> You'd better explain, then.<eos> One of the younger blokes stole the scarf from West sheds.<eos> I gave it to Scotty to sleep on.<eos> So how did it end up around Harry Harper's neck?<eos> When I went to look for Harry, when he hadn't turned up for the party,<eos> I found him.<eos> Our club captain, hanging by a rope in the shower stall.<eos> I went to my office, got that scarf, and swapped it with the rope.
This was no accident, Jack.<eos> Apart from myself, there is no-one I trust more behind the wheel than Gerty Haynes.<eos> She flew down the roads like Boadicea in her chariot.<eos> Even a Celtic queen has the odd accident.<eos> This is an impeccably maintained rally racer.<eos> Wheels don't simply fall off.<eos> Depends how recklessly you drive the car.<eos> Look at this. Look at her scarf.<eos> If Gerty had been driving along with this scarf through the door, it would be filthy.<eos> Look at it.
I'd like to see you manage my sewing machine, Hugh Collins.<eos> Any idea where Gerty was headed last night?<eos> Well, I assume she went to her usual haunt.<eos> The VAA on Graeme Street.<eos> Could she have been meeting someone?<eos> Well, if she did, she left in too much of a hurry to tell me.<eos> Did something happen last night? Before Gerty drove off?<eos> We'd had a few words.<eos> What about?<eos> We'd just ordered a twin carburettor from America for the rally and Gerty forgot to pick it up.
We'd had a few words.<eos> What about?<eos> We'd just ordered a twin carburettor from America for the rally and Gerty forgot to pick it up.<eos> And by the time she got to the docks, it had disappeared.<eos> Stolen?<eos> That, or one of the other teams got wind of our delivery and decided to help themselves.<eos> If Gerty had just gone when she said she would...<eos> Anyway, it doesn't matter.<eos> If we work all night and all tomorrow, we might get it fixed in time.<eos> Even if we can fix it, we haven't got a driver.
I just found it behind your seat.<eos> There's only your word for that.<eos> The police take my word quite seriously, usually.<eos> Maybe I should ask them to search your car more thoroughly.<eos> Nobody touches my car.<eos> Who knows what they might find.<eos> It's like I told her, I have no idea how that purse ended up in my car.<eos> Or why the doorman at the VAA Lounge identified your car as the one which followed Gerty away from the club.<eos> Obviously someone helped themselves to my car.<eos> Then put it back?
It would be my pleasure.<eos> She may not say much but she understands more than you think.<eos> Only one problem, Miss.<eos> You think it will be tricky to remove the twin carburettor?<eos> I think so, Miss.<eos> Especially 'cause it's not here.<eos> What?<eos> ! That's curious.<eos> It was there yesterday.<eos> We need it for the ladies' team.

That's curious.<eos> It was there yesterday.<eos> We need it for the ladies' team.<eos> Perhaps Claude's mechanics removed it for some adjustments.
Don't deny it.<eos> You were seen skulking around my marquee, you and two rough-looking labourers.<eos> I never skulk, and Cec and Bert are cabbies.<eos> Thieves, more like.<eos> I would appreciate it if you would return my team's property.<eos> I'm sorry, I really don't follow you.<eos> The twin carburettor.<eos> Oh.<eos> Mm-hm. Well?<eos> I'm afraid we don't have it, and as to its whereabouts, I'm as baffled as you are.
How did you come by the key to the furnace room?<eos> You must understand how this compromises you.<eos> Professor Katz's body was left to be incinerated late last night.<eos> I didn't have anything to do with what happened to Katz, so you have no proof.<eos> But we have proof you were attempting to dispose of evidence, Mr Street.<eos> Constable Collins, charge Mr Charlie Street with being an accessory to a murder.<eos> Take him down to the cells.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And we'll have to inform Professor Bradbury, so I hope it won't affect your future at Jude's College.<eos> Alright, I found it.

I didn't care about the book.<eos> I only used it to get back at Charlie.<eos> If you didn't kill Katz, how did you end up with the book?<eos> I was after the skull.<eos> So how did you go about it?<eos> Did you confront him?<eos> No, you've got it all wrong.<eos> When Beatrice turned up that night, expecting some apology from me, I thought it was Katz' doing.<eos> So I went to have it out with him after Beatrice fell asleep.<eos> And then I saw the skull, and I knew I'd be tested on it.
So maybe he's doing just a little bit more...<eos> Get on with it, Collins.<eos> Oh, and Doctor MacMillan telephoned earlier.<eos> She needs to see you and Miss Fisher at the college.<eos> This skull has certainly been around.<eos> The numbering here is American.<eos> That's because it's from Hartley University.<eos> How did it end up being the subject of your medical exam, Street?<eos> It wasn't meant for an exam.<eos> Professor Katz was just keeping it safe. From what?
Couldn't we stay in the next town, Miss?<eos> It's all bluff, Dot.<eos> They're just trying to scare us off.<eos> So, what else did you find out from Flora?<eos> She was the last person to see Oskar Voigt alive at lunchtime around one.<eos> It's very interesting, Dot.<eos> Oskar had this black substance like soot smudged all over his clothing and his hands and I found this match dropped nearby<eos> He had a bruise on his head and his fingernails looked like he'd been scratching desperately.<eos> The sooner we solve this case, the sooner we can leave.<eos> But we'll need to examine the body more thoroughly before the funeral directors cart it off first thing in the morning.
You don't understand.<eos> I don't want to be an outsider in this town.<eos> But he's your brother!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Condolences, Erik.<eos> What's going on?<eos> COLLINS: Unload that hearse, driver.<eos> What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Detective Inspector Jack Robinson.<eos> I'm afraid that body will have to remain in town until the police coroner clears it for removal.
Steady on, cowboy.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You mind telling me what the charge is?<eos> Why don't we start with obstruction?<eos> Perhaps add 'conspiracy to pervert the course of justice'?<eos> Then there's always murder.<eos> I told you, I was at the Warong Stockyards and the bridge was down.<eos> We believe you till that point.<eos> Then you cut across the gully.<eos> When you drove into town, your car was muddy. Which is why you asked Frank to clean it.
Oh, my God, Silas-- Ok.<eos> Now, where's the anchor to the other side?<eos> I'm looking for it, too. What do you mean, you don't know?<eos> You created it.<eos> Yes. I created it, but the Travelers hid it after they killed me.<eos> They move it constantly.<eos> So what are you doing here?<eos> My pendant is in one of these displays.<eos> It's a magical talisman that enhances my powers.<eos> I need it to do a locator spell so I can find the anchor.

Stefan... Stefan, are you ok?<eos> Uh!<eos> Stefan:<eos> No.<eos> He's working with my brother.<eos> Everything he said to you was a lie.<eos> [Scoffs]<eos> That's all he knows how to do--lie.<eos> You know where the anchor is.<eos> Too bad you won't be around to find it.
( laughs ) Well, anyway, we just think it would be a waste to stop the project now.<eos> I mean, we've come so far.<eos> I know, and coming in here and having to beg for money is the worst.<eos> I mean, if you could be doing your research right now, you'd be doing that instead.<eos> ( laughing ) Right?<eos> We'd be doing anything instead.<eos> So I think we covered everything.<eos> And I want you to know, I like anything about sex.<eos> Well, I used to.<eos> Now, I just miss it.
Yeah, yeah, just show me the drive.<eos> You're looking at it. Those ones and zeros, that's what we're trying to decrypt.<eos> Am I speaking a foreign language?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - He's looking for the actual USB storage jump, Harry, if you know where it is.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I believe it's over here.<eos> I haven't seen it since we uploaded the file though.<eos> And here we go.<eos> Got it.
Because it was mean?<eos> Or disobedient?<eos> People aren't born mean. The same goes for dogs.<eos> So Why?<eos> Why, Why...<eos> Do you know why people make war?<eos> There you go!<eos> There is no why.<eos> He kept the dog on a short chain.<eos> He beat it.
It all goes to getting their fix.<eos> You think someone killed him, then covered it up. - Why?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> But let's take a look at what isn't here.<eos> No computer, no tablet, no phone.<eos> What kind of hacker doesn't have a computer?<eos> It does seem strange.<eos> You found nothing with any data in it whatsoever?<eos> I found a flash drive in the microwave before you came in.<eos> Looks like he fried it.
I'm not letting this one out of my sight.<eos> So Sloan's dead brother is really alive?<eos> Yes, it seems Jason Greenfield turned himself in to the CIA.<eos> And now, Collier wants to kill him for being a traitor.<eos> Precisely.<eos> According to the plan, the assassination of Mr. Greenfield is scheduled to take place within the hour.<eos> They're probably going to interrogate Sloan on the way to their mission.<eos> So if we can find where they're going to kill Greenfield, then we still have a chance to save them both.<eos> Just give me a location, Finch.<eos> Got it.
Great job, Brandon!<eos> Way to work Matteo's inner thigh muscles.<eos> Don't forget the hip flexers.<eos> You okay there, Matteo?<eos> Great job.<eos> Luke, lay down.<eos> Jason, get to work on his glutes. Maximus and minimus.<eos> Kneed that ass!<eos> Kneed it like dough!<eos> Make it rise.

Get something to throw to him!<eos> Anything!<eos> Get the sling!<eos> Get the sling!<eos> I can't hold on for much longer!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Keep holding!<eos> Reggie, grab it!<eos> Grab the sling!<eos> Grab it!
Because like you said,<eos> "Who you are on the mat is who you are in life."<eos> "The universe is a circus."<eos> - Circle.<eos> - Circle.<eos> We have a very close-knit family.<eos> Sadly, her mother died recently of a heart attack.<eos> Probably because she saw the way her daughter dresses for yoga class.<eos> Oh, Dad.<eos> My mom's body was a lot like mine, so I like to show it off in her memory.
She wasn't just my research partner and best friend.<eos> We also had phenomenal sex together.<eos> Charlie, are you sure you want to tell us this?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're right. Too personal.<eos> She never ran out of saliva.<eos> But now she's gone.<eos> She did leave me this cool letter.<eos> If you could read that for me.<eos> ( Sighs ) Try not to crease it.
Did you get...<eos> - Born again? - Yeah.<eos> Oh, Sam, I don't make promises I can't keep.<eos> I just...<eos> I enjoy church.<eos> I mean, after...<eos> after Bobby, Crowley. Just...<eos> You know, comfort, I guess.<eos> Yeah, I guess we're all looking for that.<eos> Except those that got it.
Hell.<eos> This is a bonus, Castiel.<eos> We were tracking Muriel, cowardly holdout that she is, and wonder of wonders, she led us to you.<eos> Not knowingly.<eos> I stand corrected.<eos> Not knowingly.<eos> Stupidly.<eos> I've explained in detail.<eos> I don't know how Metatron's spell worked.<eos> Therefore, I can't assist in reversing it.
Well, Andrew is dead.<eos> The answers are here.<eos> They have to be.<eos> Turn on the TV loud.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> [TV playing indistinctly] Louder.<eos> Louder.<eos> [Pounding at door] [Speaking French]<eos> [Speaking French]<eos> Turn it off.
I did. I loaded the files this morning.<eos> You had Interpol drag my fiance away?<eos> No.<eos> Henry must have called Interpol.<eos> It's the next logical phase in his plan.<eos> Sana, as soon as Henry realizes Andrew Goodman is dead, there is nothing else we can do.<eos> He expected Andrew to plant that intel, so I did it.<eos> It's a calculated risk, but David will be fine as soon as the real truth emerges.<eos> You said you were working on a plan.<eos> I figured we'd discuss it before you acted.
I can't believe this.<eos> I have been waiting on this promotion and now you blew it.<eos> I was gonna make twice as much money and get to look down on at least three times as many people.<eos> I'm going down there right now to talk to him.<eos> You must be kidding me.<eos> What?<eos> We're hot tub buddies.<eos> Look, in our condition, it was not safe to go in here alone.<eos> Where's the key?<eos> I think that lame-o cop-stripper we stole the handcuffs from still has it.
You obviously weren't hanging out downstairs in the guest room. You know what?<eos> We're not here to talk about me, damn it.<eos> Trust me, Patrick is doing great.<eos> And I promise you that his passive-aggressive outbursts are a thing of the past.<eos> And you, you, Zac, you... you are going to look like the Grand High Priest of Einsteins if you promote this very talented young man.<eos> How are you a therapist?<eos> You show up late reeking of booze, handcuffed to a stripper, and you expect me to trust your judgment?<eos> I'm a victim of circumstance here.<eos> Charlie, I found the key.<eos> It's in my bikini top where you hid it.
You can't live there, but, um, you can visit.<eos> You guys can handle this.<eos> Listen... those firefighters and paramedics at 51?<eos> Well, they're your family too and they're gonna help me take good care of you guys. Okay?<eos> Come here, buddy.<eos> It's pretty cool... being able to drink in a bar after it's closed.<eos> Grab a couple glasses, 'cause I have a champagne cognac in the back we are gonna crack open.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> - Found it.<eos> - I can't wait to try it.
Anyway, I just wanted to say hi.<eos> Enjoy your dinner. It was nice to meet you.<eos> - You too.<eos> - I'll call you.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> - So...<eos> - So...<eos> The doctor said it could be the machine.<eos> Nick, I don't think it's the machine.<eos> I checked your pulse the night that I thought you were dead, and it was so slow, I could barely feel it.
My great-great grandfather was given the location... of an emerald mine... in exchange for his soul.<eos> There's, like, paperwork or something that proves this?<eos> They say that the day of his daughter's wedding... a great bird came from the sky and snatched him with his claws and took him far, far away.<eos> You're aware that a remarkable number of your stories end... with a family member being carried off by a giant bird.<eos> I only know what I was told, Jay.<eos> I'm just saying, after the third time... we might think about moving the party inside.<eos> Okay, maybe it's not the curse, but you know that my family has a very dark side.<eos> My cousin Aurelio is a horse thief.<eos> My Uncle Carlos fixed soccer games.<eos> Did he teach them to pick the ball up and throw it down the field?
I named my son after you.<eos> You can't be mad at me.<eos> Your son is the devil's spawn.<eos> He drinks the milk of a liver thief!<eos> Morning, Dr. Kepner,<eos> - Dr. Robbins.<eos> - Mm.<eos> Hi.<eos> Coffee?<eos> I thought you could use it before your big surgery with Dr. Shepherd.
All right, let's take a look at this penis, shall we?<eos> Mm.<eos> Uh, Dr. Avery, can you elaborate on some of your more interesting cases?<eos> I'm fascinated by all things penile.<eos> Yes, I saw evidence of that earlier this morning.<eos> How's it looking, dear?<eos> Well, it's possible he's gonna need a skin graft,<eos> - but nothing I can't fix.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, he'll be able to stick it in a hornet's nest, an ant hill, a tarantula's...
I can't do this.<eos> I don't have time.<eos> Meredith and I are in over our heads with kids,<eos> - and she needs time, too.<eos> - So maybe we just drop it.<eos> - No harm done, right?<eos> - Oh, and tell that to Mickey Wenschler.<eos> Mickey will be all right.<eos> Edwards, I just saw your broken ankle.<eos> No surgery, just splint it.
So... now that Brooks is gone...<eos> - I get to take her place?<eos> - Oh, hell.<eos> Well, that's why the sensors weren't lighting.<eos> He has a glioma.<eos> Can you treat it?<eos> I could try hitting it with some glue.<eos> - Glue?<eos> - Embolization glue.<eos> We use it for A.V.M.s.
The best course is to leave it alone and hope for the best.<eos> We'll keep doing the study, right?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because it is too dangerous.<eos> Also the tumor could give us abnormal results.<eos> What if you take the tumor out?<eos> - I could keep doing the testing.<eos> - You could, but...<eos> Then take it out, man!
She was a smart woman.<eos> It might be worse to never be compared to her.<eos> I can't find a way to take the research further.<eos> And I can't print this damn thing!<eos> You all right?<eos> We've bio-engineered blood vessels from a 3-D printer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I don't think anyone has ever printed a portal vein.<eos> It's never been done before.<eos> The glue is designed for use in your brain, but I would like to try it in your heart.
He's known as the Courier, and his involvement in a transaction virtually guarantees success.<eos> Once he's hired to make a delivery, he can't be bribed, he can't be stopped.<eos> If either a party attempts to double-cross the other, he kills them both.<eos> The perfect middleman for an imperfect world.<eos> Cooper's not gonna sanction a black op against the U.P.S. driver of crime.<eos> He will when you tell him the Courier is scheduled to deliver a package worth $20 million.<eos> At that price, it could be anything from a genetically engineered virus to a very important person's head in a bag.<eos> Does he have a name?<eos> I'm sure he does.<eos> I don't know it.
And now the buyer and seller have targets on their head, if they're not dead already.<eos> Her name's Laurence Dechambou.<eos> She's ex-French intelligence.<eos> She now makes a handsome living selling secrets, mostly of a technological nature.<eos> I really don't understand any of it.<eos> But she's clearly stepping up on this one, trying to make a legacy for herself.<eos> She owns that nightclub.<eos> Last time I was there, we had a great deal of fun, until she tried to strangle me with her stocking.<eos> I'll get a warrant.<eos> You'll have it by the time you get there.
here are three cases with sloppy paperwork.<eos> here are two pictures.<eos> one is your locker.<eos> the other is a garbage dump in the philippines.<eos> can you tell which is which?<eos> they're both your locker.<eos> gah, i should've guessed that.<eos> he's good.<eos> this folder is labeled "undies, dirty."<eos> so i won't confuse it with "undies, clean."
did you just say "genital-man"?<eos> because if so, kudos, and yes, i have a plan.<eos> i'm gonna plant a decoy squad car as bait.<eos> meanwhile, i'll be waiting in an undercover vehicle here.<eos> he's already tagged three u/c vehicles.<eos> he can clearly spot 'em.<eos> you should take my minivan. a minivan?<eos> a-ha!<eos> [laughter] you all got a problem with my minivan?<eos> 'cause my wife doesn't like it either.
you're busted.<eos> already got him. we got him.<eos> oh, hey, captain.<eos> hi, so i was able to procure that $50 after all, and my offer still stands.<eos> let me do whatever i want, and the $40-- that's how much i actually have--is yours.<eos> fair enough.<eos> i only had 30 anyway.<eos> well, i guess in order to get you to stop micromanaging me, i'm gonna have to get back to the most important piece of police work there is:<eos> writing a perfect report.<eos> good, i'm anxious to read it.
What time is it?<eos> Two minutes to 8:00.<eos> All right, everyone to the table.<eos> Let's take this call.<eos> Table, boys.<eos> Table.<eos> Hey, Chucky.<eos> You know where this pen came from?<eos> Yeah, it's a shamrock pen.<eos> Delivery guy left it a few hours ago.
I do.<eos> You guys call the captain.<eos> I'll wait here for the subpoena, wearing my badge, greeting customers.<eos> The only extra, extra large sale this month was last night.<eos> About 9:30.<eos> I was here.<eos> Guy definitely wasn't shopping for himself.<eos> He was a medium at most.<eos> Okay, we're gonna need his name.<eos> I don't have it.
Well, the owner says he was about a hundred yards behind.<eos> I know-- there's no way that the gunman would've had time to make it clear across the field.<eos> But I figure... the owner was further back from the gunman than he thought.<eos> Yes, that's one possible explanation.<eos> Another possible explanation is that he didn't disappear at all, he just took to higher ground, to see how many people were following him and then planned his escape.<eos> These trees are over a hundred years old.<eos> There's no low-hanging branches.<eos> But this young oak would work.<eos> He would have to hoist himself up, off that branch.<eos> Yes, which means he had to grab it.
I don't know.<eos> They were just cold.<eos> Like the Arctic.<eos> The only man to ever lay eyes on El Mecanico has a weakness for unhelpful metaphors.<eos> Are you still sulking about Mycroft?<eos> No.<eos> I hope you don't expect me to apologize.<eos> Look, if I had a sister, would you even hesitate for a second before you slept with her?<eos> It's not the act itself that gives me pause.<eos> It's that I can't put it into context.
- Right.<eos> - Hey, can I help?<eos> - Sure.<eos> You know... I want you to know that I will always be there for you, no matter what.<eos> Nothing you do could make me love you less.<eos> Even if I grow up to be like Dad?<eos> Oh, honey... the fact that you're doing a puzzle means you won't end up like your Dad.<eos> How's the cheesecake?<eos> Awesome!<eos> Do you like it, Violet?
It doesn't work that way when you marry for money.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> I hear Chef Rudy is experimenting.<eos> Maybe you could find happiness with him.<eos> Who ate all my pudding?<eos> - Wasn't me.<eos> - Okay, I'm out of here.<eos> - Mom, did you eat my pudding?<eos> - Um, no.<eos> Maybe you ate it.
(Sighs deeply) Well, I might not feel like it, but today's your lucky day.<eos> There is a way to stop him from dying.<eos> Tell me.<eos> This spring... these waters are rich with the power of Neverland.<eos> It's what keeps this land and all on it so... young.<eos> If one was to drink directly from it, its power could cure any ill.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But... I must warn you.<eos> All magic comes with a price, and that spring is no exception.<eos> Don't leave the island unless you're willing to pay it.
Well, that's down the hall.<eos> Uh, wouldn't it be faster if I just looked at the computer readouts?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're a sex researcher and you don't like watching people have sex.<eos> Look, most of the research that I've done is dry, and this is... wet.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Look what you made me say.<eos> You think sex is dirty.<eos> I think sex is beautiful.<eos> I think people make it dirty.

Look, the board forced me to hire you, so I did.<eos> But you quit and I replaced you.<eos> My uncle is in charge of the entire grant foundation, and he says if I'm not working here, he's going to shut down your entire study.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> It gets worse.<eos> He says that I am in charge, so I guess that kind of makes me your boss.<eos> You're my boss?<eos> And we start at 9:00 AM here.<eos> And I think that our first priority should be making this an alcohol-free office.<eos> Okay, why don't we take all the booze and put it in that room over there?
Papa?<eos> Papa?<eos> Papa!<eos> These are Henry's shoes.<eos> Wendy was right. They're here.<eos> (Grunts) Are you okay?<eos> I think so.<eos> What was that?<eos> Pan cast a protection spell.<eos> There has to be a way to break it.
What's wrong?<eos> Rumple?<eos> Papa!<eos> I thought something terrible had happened to you.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm fine, son.<eos> You don't have to worry about me.<eos> Did you get pixie dust?<eos> Yes.<eos> But when I tried using it, it didn't work.
And you'll feel better.<eos> Later we'll spin, hmm?<eos> Where's your doll?<eos> I lost him. Oh.<eos> Well, we'll make you another one.<eos> You can give it the same name.<eos> No.<eos> Peter Pan is gone forever.<eos> What is this place?<eos> I don't remember seeing it from my dreams.
Your youth will be taken and you will die.<eos> But I thought I was going to stay young forever.<eos> Neverland is a place for children to visit in their dreams, not a place for them to live.<eos> You are the first to try to stay.<eos> And in doing so, you're breaking the rules.<eos> Any rule can be broken, especially here.<eos> I made this place without even thinking about it.<eos> There has to be a way.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Then I will find it.
Enough with the questions. You don't answer mine, I don't answer yours.<eos> ___<eos> Yeah, coming up zero here.<eos> Can you give them a call?<eos> Yeah, I know, mate, but I've got no other options.<eos> So even when you're a kid, you knew that's what you wanted to do?<eos> I don't know about that, mate, but definitely once I finished school.<eos> - And then something got in your way.<eos> - Nothing got in my way.<eos> I had a dream and I made it happen.
- OK, let's go.<eos> No, we'll go after her.<eos> You guys go into the shop to see if you can find any clues.<eos> If she is behind these attacks, she'll need things from us for her spell.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Stray hair, some flaky skin.<eos> Just as long as it comes from us.<eos> You want us to collect bodily secretions?<eos> There's a spare key under the pot plant below the wind chimes.<eos> It's where she hides it in our world.
The background report I had you run on Dahlia.<eos> I paid for it. Now I'd like to see it.<eos> Okay, I-I know you're upset.<eos> We've all been caught off guard by what happened.<eos> But I can assure you there is nothing in that report that indicates any issues.<eos> I will be the judge of that.<eos> All right, look... my investigators dropped the ball.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The report in 24 hours or you're fired.<eos> You can have it now.

I got rid of the last cash today.<eos> On lot 426?<eos> - How did you know about that? - Hayden played you.<eos> He switched out your emails, and made you bid on the wrong item today.<eos> Then what did I purchase?<eos> A real ball, signed by the real 1927 Yankees, really worth 4.4 million.<eos> That was a hell of a season.<eos> Where's the ball, Sven?<eos> It's gone.<eos> I sold it for $5.
that's actually the worst part.<eos> my doctor said i have an anal canyon.<eos> ugh, god, scully, why are you always telling us about your disgusting body?<eos> i don't see anything.<eos> that's because it's all wart.<eos> [retching] peralta, where are we on the adams street burglary?<eos> aside from a complete absence of evidence, suspects, or leads.<eos> so, in conclusion, not at all close.<eos> and the vickers street aggravated assault?<eos> stalled out, and the calloway robbery due to a lack of solving it by me.
Barney, here's a good one.<eos> What's the difference between a Journey song and a husband?<eos> A Journey song has a climax.<eos> I'm sorry, Robin.<eos> I'm just messing with you.<eos> Raise a hundred.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> It's just funny hearing all this anti-marriage stuff from a divorced guy who still wears his wedding ring.<eos> What, this?<eos> Mm. Only wear it because, nothing attracts a gay guy faster than a wedding ring.
Yeah?<eos> Sit down.<eos> What... at the table?<eos> No, on my dick.<eos> Yeah, at the table.<eos> Take off the cut.<eos> On the table.<eos> I need you to cut off that prospect rocker.<eos> Hey.<eos> Replace it with this, young brother.
Is there a problem? Not for her.<eos> The Captain gave us her name.<eos> As a possible witness to a bar fight.<eos> You wanna talk to her about a bar fight?<eos> Yeah, well, one of the guys in the fight died.<eos> It's just a couple of questions. It won't take very long.<eos> When did he die?<eos> In the hospital, after the fight.<eos> I guess he was beat up pretty bad.<eos> Anyway, now it's murder and we got it.
I called in an apb.<eos> - How old's the boy? - Nine.<eos> Parents forced the door open after the whole thing went bad.<eos> And by "whole thing", I mean what apparently... Was an exorcism.<eos> An exorcism?<eos> Parents called 911.<eos> Door was open when we got here.<eos> Same with the window.<eos> Where'd you find the seminary student?<eos> Photo of the scene as we found it.
What does this prove?<eos> Daniel was infected by a parasite that caused him to be what you and the council call a Grausen.<eos> It's not possession by demon, it's not mutation, and Daniel has been cured.<eos> You're a Grimm.<eos> You should know better.<eos> I need to see the boy.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> And you need to take my word for it, because of what my ancestors and the council agreed to at the charter of Wittenberg in 1682.<eos> Take the report with you when you go.<eos> I want the council to read it.
Okay, it's not gonna say that.<eos> Well, I hope you're wrong.<eos> I really want to go to the train store.<eos> It's the comic book store.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on, numb nuts, it's the comic book store!<eos> It's the comic book store, it's the comic book store, it's the comic book store!<eos> It's the comic book store.<eos> Do you think Penny's mad at me?<eos> Because you're in the right lane behind a bus and you won't go around it?
My brain is better than everybody's!<eos> ♪ Love on the rocks<eos> ♪ Ain't no big surprise ♪<eos> ♪ Just pour me a drink<eos> ♪ And I'll tell you some lies... ♪<eos> Call me a lady part.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Can you reach the clue?<eos> Almost. Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley.<eos> Got it!
That's not just a red flag; that's a motive.<eos> Why would someone want to kill Marv?<eos> We were hoping you could tell us.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> That's not what we heard.<eos> Sounded like you had a pretty big ax to grind.<eos> Then you're misinformed.<eos> Marv was my closest friend.<eos> Signing your termination papers wasn't too friendly.<eos> Friends are supposed to have your back, not stab you in it.
Did you want me to pinky swear?<eos> She's trying to have a good day.<eos> Just tell her how it's gonna go down.<eos> I just want to destroy the other side so I don't get stuck in that pit of a Purgatory when I finally do kill myself.<eos> Before I do that, I'll bring Bonnie back, and being the amazing and incredible and all-powerful witch that I am, I can totally do both things.<eos> I just have to find The Anchor first and destroy it.<eos> The Anchor?<eos> Silas is looking for The Anchor.<eos> It's the object I used to bind the spell when I created the other side.<eos> Destroy it, the spell's broken.
The IRT was hopeless.<eos> - The what?<eos> - The subway.<eos> ( clears throat ) Where were you coming from?<eos> Downtown.<eos> That's where you work?<eos> Is that a cinnamon roll?<eos> Have some.<eos> You don't like cinnamon.<eos> No, I hate it.
The one who used to be in college.<eos> You were pretty concerned about him.<eos> The fucking which of Investigation?<eos> His roommate is sitting in a cell awaiting trial on a murder charge.<eos> And you know about people in jail.<eos> They all say they're innocent.<eos> But he told me a story anyway.<eos> Two boys drive to Atlantic City.<eos> Steal liquor from a warehouse controlled by the first boy's father.<eos> They poison this liquor, give it to another boy at school that first boy doesn't like.
What the hell kind of mischief you...<eos> Gabriel said,<eos> "Keep your servant also from willful sins."<eos> Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.<eos> "May they not rule over me.<eos> "Then will I be blameless." Breathe.<eos> "Innocent of great transgression."<eos> The bridegroom has got the ring<eos> And it's such a pretty thing<eos> He slips it on her finger

They had to know you were here, Al.<eos> - In advance.<eos> - The phone call.<eos> Now, how did he get the number anyway?<eos> That Jew prick Hymie Weiss.<eos> Actually, he's Catholic.<eos> Wojciechowski.<eos> Wo-ja-what?<eos> His name.<eos> He changed it to Weiss.
Well, enjoy, boys!<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, come join us.<eos> Well, thank you very much.<eos> The only thing sweeter than your manners is my peach cobbler.<eos> Spoiler alert-- tomorrow night.<eos> Well, I will be a gobbler of your cobbler.<eos> I am gonna stitch that on a pillow.<eos> Oh, do you... do you mind if I say grace?<eos> Oh. Yeah, sure, go ahead.<eos> Uh, should I eat this unblessed biscuit, or spit it out?
Wait.<eos> What?<eos> And lead them out of their sinful homosexual lifestyles lest their souls burn in the fiery pits of hell for all eternity with all of the other Sodomites.<eos> Amen.<eos> Can I get some sweet potatoes?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Alan?<eos> What?<eos> She already thinks we're gobbling each others' cobblers.<eos> When you're finished with that dish, just leave it, and I'll take care of it.
We just, uh...<eos> You know, we really like pancakes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, you know, I suppose waffles are-are fine.<eos> Yeah, waffles.<eos> Chicken and waffles?<eos> You know what? Let's...<eos> Let's just forget breakfast.<eos> I'll just... I'll just have coffee.<eos> How do you take it?
Not really the look I'm going for. Why not?<eos> It's old-fashioned, that's something that Rita would wear.<eos> What! ?<eos> It would be so cool.<eos> Nothing.<eos> If Zac gets hold of the trident, mermen could rise again and conquer the oceans.<eos> But hey, as long as we've got the right accessories. Alright, OK, we get the message.<eos> Alright, if Zac gets the trident that's a bad thing but it's locked away on Mako.<eos> He's going to be looking for it.<eos> And you'll be watching him, making sure he doesn't find it, right?
Yes!<eos> I do!<eos> Say the name.<eos> Please don't make me! Say the name.<eos> Say it.<eos> Fiona!<eos> Fiona Goode!<eos> I say her name.<eos> I bless it!<eos> As long as there is a tongue in this head, I will say it!
Came from a boy.<eos> Newly born.<eos> Youth begets youth.<eos> I know who's been between your legs, whore.<eos> You needn't bother to give that baby a name.<eos> You didn't.<eos> Couldn't have a high yellow bastard growing up in my house, laying claims to our fortune.<eos> The poor girl, next morning she threw herself off the balcony.<eos> Cracked her head open on the pavement.<eos> Cracked it open like an egg.
Morning.<eos> Here.<eos> Coffee?<eos> Yeah, with a little milk and sugar.<eos> My daddy let me try it on my first hunting trip.
And you're gonna lose.<eos> Meningeal carcinomatosis.<eos> That's what the doctor called it.<eos> Tiny seedlings that the cancer planted in the lining of my spine.<eos> The little bastards are Satan's diet pill.<eos> I used to think I understood pain.<eos> A burn, a cut, a broken bone.<eos> Heartbreak.<eos> But this is as if I've been dipped in the River Styx and all the suffering of all the souls that ever were or will be has soaked my body.<eos> My body doesn't belong to me-- not that I'd want it in this state.
I'm really sorry. I promised them. I'll call you.<eos> I don't understand. Where would Zac get a moon ring from?<eos> Only one place a mermaid.<eos> No mermaid would give up her moon ring. Except Aquata.<eos> Only because she was so worried about me.<eos> Maybe this mermaid didn't have a choice.<eos> Maybe she was a warrior and perished in the last battle between mermaids and mermen.<eos> And so it lay there for a thousand years until Zac found it?<eos> What's it mean if a land girl like Evie gets a moon ring?<eos> If she takes it into the moonlight, there is no telling what it will do.
But she does live near a beach.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, that'll be the bread rolls.<eos> I'll give you a hand.<eos> Boy, this punch looks good. Oh!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> OK, don't worry.<eos> Where'd you flick it to? I don't know.

Oh!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> OK, don't worry.<eos> Where'd you flick it to? I don't know.<eos> Oh, brilliant!<eos> Seriously, if you find it, what are you even gonna do with it? You don't know how to look after it safely.

You don't know how to look after it safely.<eos> It'll be a lot safer than if you've got it.<eos> You really think we'd use it against you?
What, now?<eos> We're just serving.<eos> I'll only be a second. I should help.<eos> Lyla's very good with computers.<eos> So is Sirena.<eos> I should go too.<eos> Me too.<eos> Maybe I should just move the table in there.<eos> Where's my ring?<eos> Alright, just hand it over.
I'll only be a second. I should help.<eos> Lyla's very good with computers.<eos> So is Sirena.<eos> I should go too.<eos> Me too.<eos> Maybe I should just move the table in there.<eos> Where's my ring?<eos> Alright, just hand it over.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> You're not gonna be able to hide it now. Then I'll do it later.

Then I'll do it later.<eos> We can't let you do that.<eos> I literally left it right on the table. Yes, it was right there.
Yes.<eos> Long ago, there was this...<eos> Who was dating a crab, you see.<eos> And one day the crab gave the turtle this Golden ring, which, you know, she promised she would never lose.<eos> May as well go back and eat.<eos> I'm not handing it over. Then we'll have to take it.<eos> How exactly?<eos> Like this.<eos> You're gonna have to be faster than that.<eos> If only the turtle had realised the ring was exactly where she left it all along.
Maybe Zac didn't get the trident.<eos> We never saw him with it, so maybe he was too late.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Wishful thinking.<eos> It's not.<eos> You always think he's smarter than he actually is.<eos> Giving us the slip, so either he's smart or we're really dumb.<eos> Well, that still doesn't mean he actually got it.
Shouldn't you all be getting ready for school?<eos> Yep. Just on our way.<eos> Well, off you go, then.<eos> We'll be seeing you around, Zac.<eos> They mean it.<eos> Gotta find a good place to stash it fast.<eos> Why even bother pretending that he hasn't got it?<eos> See, Lyla, told you he wasn't smart.<eos> He's still got the trident and we don't.<eos> So how do we get it back?
He's still got the trident and we don't.<eos> So how do we get it back?<eos> Well, we wait till he's gone to school, and then we turn his place upside down.<eos> I'll meet you there later.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Hey, Zac.<eos> Not again. Go away, Lyla.<eos> I'm telling the truth.<eos> It really is dangerous.<eos> You'll try anything to get your hands on it, won't you?
I don't know. She could just be visiting.<eos> Yeah, but why now?<eos> You saw the girl in Mako?<eos> You only saw one, right?<eos> Yeah, I only saw one. But there could be more.<eos> There could be a lot more.<eos> They're after the trident.<eos> Well, it must do something pretty powerful if they're sending reinforcements in to get it back.<eos> I know, but what?<eos> He's got it.

But there could be more.<eos> There could be a lot more.<eos> They're after the trident.<eos> Well, it must do something pretty powerful if they're sending reinforcements in to get it back.<eos> I know, but what?<eos> He's got it.<eos> He unlocked the chamber?<eos> The Pod was right to flee.<eos> The last time mermen had the trident, they tried to take over Mako.<eos> He can't use it if he doesn't have it.
How many pods are there? No idea.<eos> It's a big ocean.<eos> How many mermaids could they summon in an emergency?<eos> You might be in some trouble, mate.<eos> That trident's mine.<eos> I have to know what it does.<eos> Then you better hurry up and figure it out.<eos> Cos, if there's enough of them, they could get it back.<eos> Santos let slip it's somehow connected to what happened to me when I fell into that pool and got transformed.<eos> Well, maybe that's why you have to take it to the, uh, what's it called?
OK?<eos> What if it is hidden in that secret little pool of theirs?<eos> Too easy.<eos> They're pretty smart cookies, particularly Lyla.<eos> So you're just gonna search the whole ocean?<eos> Not quite.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Do you remember how the trident affects them?<eos> Uh, sort of drains their energy or something. Yeah.<eos> So when Lyla grabbed it, she couldn't have taken it very far before it started affecting her.

And I know what speed they can travel at underwater, so the trident should be... somewhere along this line.
I'll be back in a minute. You start without me.<eos> Thanks a lot!<eos> See how stupid you've been?<eos> And all for what?<eos> There must be something else you can do.<eos> Without the power of the ring, we don't have time to wait for the next full moon to charge them.<eos> There might be another way.<eos> The trident it stores the power of the moon.<eos> You've got the trident.<eos> You have to let us use it!
The trident it stores the power of the moon.<eos> You've got the trident.<eos> You have to let us use it!<eos> We have to save Lyla!<eos> It's the only way, Zac.<eos> I knew we couldn't trust him. Why would he care?<eos> Where have you been? Where is it?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I was careful.<eos> I'm taking it.
I should have never brought the trident out in the first place.<eos> At last we agree on something.<eos> None of this is what I wanted. Then you have to put the trident back where it belongs.<eos> Please.<eos> What happened to me it's nothing.<eos> Lyla!<eos> It's a mermaid's deepest secret.<eos> He should know. Hasn't he proven himself trustworthy today?<eos> If the trident is taken into the Moon Pool on a full moon, it'll destroy the Moon Pool forever.<eos> That's why you have to put it back.
Hey, want to grab something to eat?<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> What's the matter? You've hardly spoken to me all morning.<eos> You could have owned that reef, that whole island.<eos> Now, I helped you get the trident back, and what did you do?<eos> Locked it up in that cave again.

We need to talk.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> There's nothing wrong with me.<eos> You're the one he knocked unconscious.<eos> Or do you not remember? Yeah. Yeah, I remember.<eos> I also remember that he was the one who saved me.<eos> That's right. He didn't have to do that.<eos> He didn't have to zap her in the first place. He didn't have to make himself our enemy, but he did.<eos> He also didn't have to put the trident back, but he did.<eos> Yeah, right where he can get it straight back next full moon.
Am I really the reason your pod left?<eos> Not you personally.<eos> But the fact you're a merman, yeah.<eos> Mermaids fear them more than anything else in the ocean.<eos> And there was really a war between them?<eos> That trident you found, that was the mermen's greatest weapon.<eos> The mermaids were powerless against it.<eos> How did they survive?<eos> Because of one merman.<eos> He knew the war was wrong so he took the trident and locked it away in a chamber where it could never be found. Till I did.

Someone got out on the wrong side of the kelp bed this morning.<eos> I just have a lot on my mind. Care to share?<eos> Okay.<eos> I thought we were on the same side, but I can take a hint when I'm hit over the head with it.<eos> Zac wants to tell Evie he's a merman.<eos> No way.<eos> Maybe it was the dream.<eos> What dream? About the trident.<eos> I'm sure that's all he ever thinks about.<eos> I didn't want to tell you this, but Zac said the trident makes him feel really powerful, and that he has to have it.
Well, well.<eos> Who's this beautiful, wounded bird?<eos> Don't waste your time. I'm numb from the neck down.<eos> Hmm.<eos> So the head's still in play?<eos> Hold your horses, I'm coming.<eos> I figured it out.<eos> I'm not giving up.<eos> If I'm gonna go down, I'm gonna go down fighting.<eos> If it stands up to pee, I'm banging it.
All it does is move up our timetable a touch.<eos> We need to get Henry ready.<eos> And I need to have a chat with our friend in the other cage.<eos> Pan's shadow?<eos> That's your way off the island?<eos> Unfortunately, it's the only way. Oh.<eos> We thought you learned how to navigate the stars.<eos> I know how to navigate the stars, but I can't fly.<eos> I'm guessing that's where the shadow comes in.<eos> That's why we have to capture it.
(Cries) Belle.<eos> (Gasps) Rumple.<eos> I hope you raised the cloaking spell.<eos> The people headed for town as far more dangerous than even I first believed.<eos> They're unwitting pawns in Pan's game.<eos> I told you I was going to my death.<eos> I found another way. I can defeat Pan and live...<eos> But only if you get me something from the shop.<eos> The object I need is hidden.<eos> But I know that with the strength of our love, you'll find it.
Sorry we're so late.<eos> Bernadette got stuck at work. Great news!<eos> A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans!<eos> Why is that great news?<eos> In the pharmaceutical business, we have a saying:<eos> "Mo' infections, mo' money."<eos> Wait!<eos> Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first.<eos> Oh, calm down.<eos> If I had it, I'd be dead already.
You don't know what a sex tape is, do you?<eos> No.<eos> Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by 8:00.<eos> Bernadette's meeting me there at 8:30 and I don't want to blow the surprise.<eos> We'll be there.<eos> Got it.<eos> Now, uh, I have a question about the song.<eos> I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.<eos> N-N-N-No...<eos> Come on, come on, you haven't even heard it yet.
Well, let's just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips.<eos> You're sure you're okay?<eos> Yeah, it's just a precaution.<eos> If there was a problem, I'd be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now.<eos> Sorry I messed up our date.<eos> , don't worry about it.<eos> I brought the date here.<eos> Guys, come on in.<eos> What's all this?<eos> Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you.
That came right off my mom's back.<eos> He's kidding.<eos> If that were true, it'd be so much bigger.<eos> "My name is Howard.<eos> "I can make your hair into diamonds.<eos> "My mom is morbidly obese.<eos> Everybody love me."<eos> Whoa, where is that coming from?<eos> I'll tell you where it's coming from.<eos> All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls' night and now you're here ruining it for everyone.
Coulson, I found it.<eos> It's a chitauri helmet.<eos> Fitz-Simmons, are you seeing this?<eos> It's not a weapon, Yet it caused a cranial discharge.<eos> What are you doing with the helmet? What, the... alien thing?<eos> I-it's a souvenir.<eos> Not again!<eos> Answer the question, Mr. Diaz...<eos> What are you doing with the helmet?<eos> The first time anyone's touched it since New York was a couple nights ago.

That wasn't rust.

That wasn't rust.<eos> May, don't touch it!<eos> Sir, he's not using a weapon... he's infected.<eos> I think the helmet was the source of an alien virus.<eos> All we did was clean it... I swear.<eos> Me, Frankie, and Adam... we... We were bored on the third shift, so... so we decided to clean it.
So, what do we do?<eos> We wait and get ready.<eos> Ready for what?<eos> For whatever it is we're called upon to do.<eos> Coulson, nice to see you're not dead.<eos> Did you get our analysis of the virus?<eos> We did, and S.H.I.E.L.D. has no record of anything like it.<eos> No one does.<eos> So it's imperative it reach the sandbox without incident.<eos> In case of a pandemic, we're going to need it.
No, you're right.<eos> Level 8.<eos> But...<eos> I know.<eos> Trust the system.<eos> May?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Say cheese.<eos> Okay, you have the flash drive.<eos> I programmed it with a decoy crawler.
I don't.<eos> I remember.<eos> But if you did... I could see why.<eos> I mean, Oliver Queen.<eos> He is a billionaire by day and saves the city by night.<eos> Sounds like you want to date him.<eos> I just have a little experience with liking someone who doesn't see you the same way.<eos> Protests continue into the final countdown for tonight's ignition of S.T.A.R. Lab's controversial particle accelerator.<eos> S.T.A.R. Lab's founder Harrison Wells promises a new era of scientific advancement is at hand.<eos> I guess I won't be back in time to see them turn it on.

There's a... smell... something rotting.<eos> I smell... nothing.<eos> Before leaving for his dad's, he left a piece of.... food somewhere.<eos> Hey, let's go back to bed, get some sleep.<eos> Tomorrow's a big day.<eos> You're going back to your old job.<eos> Can't you do that in your sleep?<eos> You want me to help you look?<eos> How can you help if you can't even smell the smell?<eos> And you cut it the hell out.
There is no Mr. Wu with a valve repair.<eos> Very good.<eos> Here you go.<eos> What's this for?<eos> Well, you stayed up all night keeping my patients awake while I got a good night's rest.<eos> So... coffee.<eos> Are you headed downstairs?<eos> Dr. Grey's presenting the 3-D printer.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> I'm gonna look at it later.
- Right here...<eos> - With the eye twitch.<eos> Eventually, even using a patient's own cells to prevent rejection.<eos> Welcome to the age of personalized medicine.<eos> - A fork?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Technology.<eos> Well, at least it isn't a spork.<eos> You guys, we just got the printer yesterday.<eos> We're testing it out.
Sorry, trauma came in this morning, and now you're in...<eos> O.R. 3.<eos> But I planned for O.R. 2.<eos> It was set up exactly the way I needed it for my procedure.<eos> O.R. 3's identical to O.R. 2.<eos> Good to have you back, Ben.<eos> Um...<eos> What's wrong with O.R. 3?<eos> Is there a smell in there, too?<eos> There is a smell in Tuck's room, and I'm gonna find it.
Good morning, Will.<eos> My big day started out as a nightmare when a clown came in at dawn, asking me if I wanted a balloon animal.<eos> Clowns are a peds floor hazard.<eos> Are you still going to try to remove all of the tumors today?<eos> It just seems like it's a lot to do all at once.<eos> Will's cancer is a very aggressive sarcoma.<eos> It's an all-or-nothing approach.<eos> We've come up with a plan to remove all of them, starting with number one.<eos> Some will be a snap, but there are a few tricky ones, like tumor number eight.<eos> It's deep in the liver, but we'll do our best to get it.

I call it honor.<eos> Honor?<eos> Is that really the only reason you're here, Thapa?<eos> I carry out my orders.<eos> No more, no less.<eos> Yeah, but that thumb drive's pretty tempting, isn't it?<eos> An operational plan to seize Pakistan's nukes; to make the looming threat against your country disappear forever.<eos> Maybe your command didn't tell you to bring it back... but you'd get a hero's welcome if you did.<eos> Let's say you got your hands on the thumb drive.<eos> You tell me you're just going to hand it over to us and walk away?
I prefer to work alone.<eos> Hmm, I used to feel the same way.<eos> What changed?<eos> I found somebody worth trusting.<eos> And your team trusts me?<eos> I can't really speak for my team, but, uh I do.<eos> Why?<eos> It's a damn good question.<eos> I understand that you want the thumb drive.<eos> And I get that, 'cause if I was you, I'd want it, too.
And what happened?<eos> She found out there was another cop working undercover and she shot him in the head.<eos> Obviously, LAPD shut it down and then they pulled me out.<eos> And you want to reestablish contact.<eos> Thapa's on his way to see her right now.<eos> All I got to do is beat him there.<eos> You need a suit.<eos> Hetty brief you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We assessed the location in Ops and, honestly, I don't like it.
Who takes that shot?<eos> Took you long enough.<eos> Stay with me, Thapa.<eos> I owe you guys an apology.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Tell me you secured the thumb drive, we're going to forget about it.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> Well, who has it- - Deeks?<eos> Um, no.<eos> I mean, he would have said if he had it, right?

Clay and Gaalan got 20 years of history together.<eos> A lot of deals, both on and off the IRA table.<eos> Now, my guess is, whatever deal they had set up went bad.<eos> There's a lot of that going around.<eos> I know it's not the way you wanted it, but from what I've seen on the news, I delivered everything I promised.<eos> KG-9's, IRA supplier, local gun dealer.<eos> I held up my half of the deal.<eos> You're a very smart man, Mr. Teller.<eos> I can see how you've risen to your rank.<eos> Unfortunately, I inherited it.
- Tell me which one deserves it.<eos> - None of 'em do, - and I don't need to spend a day in the E.R....<eos> - Dr. Bailey, that's all.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> We're gonna review an intraluminal approach.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay, so, you, me, and Tuck...<eos> We should think of costumes that have three parts, like the three stooges.<eos> I have a witch's hat.<eos> I put it on every year and call it a day.
She was just here.<eos> She was asking about trick or treating around the hospital, and I just stepped out to change my flight...<eos> You couldn't keep an eye on her for five minutes?<eos> What's-what's going on?<eos> Taryn's body isn't producing adrenaline.<eos> You know what adrenaline does?<eos> It keeps your organs from going into shock and shutting down when you get hurt or traumatized or scared.<eos> You said that she started to feel sick last night<eos> - watching the scary movie?<eos> - She wanted to watch it.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, okay, I guess it is.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> See, someone starts spinning out, you just shut it down.<eos> But, you know, you can still tell him he's pretty, if you want to.<eos> Fix the wings?<eos> Yes, and changed the future of science.<eos> I figured out the sensor array.<eos> I insert it into a 2-centimeter burr hole.
Analytically-minded and pretty as a peach.<eos> The warrior in the story?<eos> Well, in the story, he came to Earth to fight, but he ended up falling in love.<eos> With whom?<eos> With life on Earth.<eos> Humanity.<eos> He fell so much in love that, when his army returned to Asgard, he stayed behind.<eos> What happened to the staff?<eos> Well, he didn't want its dark magic falling into the wrong hands.<eos> So he broke it into three pieces, and hid each one in a different location.
Why don't we leave it alone?<eos> I mean, he just pulled his arm out...<eos> Quiet!<eos> I want to hear this.<eos> One of my men is hurt, the staff is gone...<eos> I didn't want any of that to happen.<eos> What did you want?<eos> - The staff's power for yourself?<eos> - Nothing like that.<eos> You know, I just wanted to be the first to study it.
They said they would murder my son.<eos> If we make one wrong move...<eos> Any electronics, any comms, any sign of surveillance, and they'll terminate the arrangement.<eos> I'll give myself up, no problem, get him back.<eos> I can figure it out from there.<eos> You're still recovering.<eos> We can't just hand you over to them like that. Can we?<eos> Fitz-Simmons have a non-electronic method of tracking him.<eos> Simmons has fabricated an odorless scent.<eos> I have an instrument which can detect it, works like a bloodhound.
I mean it.<eos> All right, Wade, moment of truth.<eos> I can't do it. I hate the noise.<eos> I hate the music they play in the waiting rooms.<eos> I hate the-the pain.<eos> (sighs) I hate the fact they ask you questions, then expect you to answer while their hand's halfway down your throat.<eos> I've been having some trouble sleeping lately, on account of the new job, so the doctor gave me pills.<eos> For anxiety. Tansy, you do realize a job which requires you to medicate probably isn't a good job.<eos> It's the worst.<eos> I hate it.
I know why the horseman came here tonight.<eos> He's looking for his skull.<eos> Why would he think it was here?<eos> The Masons are the traditional guardians of secrets and artifacts for the side of good.<eos> The horseman would have assumed that his skull was in their possession.<eos> When the horseman came last time Katrina warned us that if he got his skull the other three Horsemen of the Apocalypse would rise.<eos> The horseman is here to hasten the end of days.<eos> Just as he tried before.<eos> We must retrieve his head before he does.<eos> And this time, we destroy it.

Turned it from a sanctuary to a prison.
Yeah, you know, kind of like "don't ask, don't tell."<eos> Like that ever works.<eos> Yeah, we can just talk about current events and the weather. Mm-hmm. How about tonight?<eos> I mean, I could come by yours... if you're free and...<eos> 7:00 p.m. maybe?<eos> Okay.<eos> Catherine?<eos> Uh, thank you.

Don't look back!<eos> Charming!<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> The shadow.<eos> It killed her.<eos> Pan's shadow?<eos> I trapped it on the sail.<eos> Yeah, well, it got free.<eos> Hook, let's go back to the ship and get the candle.<eos> If it strikes again, we need to be able to capture it.
Please tell me you didn't keep it down here.<eos> Where else would I keep it?<eos> What is it?<eos> What did Pan take?<eos> - A curse?<eos> The curse that tore everyone from the Enchanted Forest, and dropped them here.<eos> You broke me out of jail to tell me how everyone got to this town?<eos> I broke you out of jail because this spell is gonna give us everything we've always wanted.<eos> Why would Pan even want the curse?<eos> I already cast it.

And this time, without your parents' true love woven in, even you would be powerless to break it.
I don't care if it's better.<eos> I want my furniture back!<eos> Well, you're not even gonna try it?<eos> Mom, that's not the point.<eos> You can't just...<eos> Oh, this is way better.<eos> Told ya. Now look.<eos> Look at the kitchen table.<eos> It's got leaves.<eos> We can widen it for when we have dinner parties.
- In the closet.<eos> Oh, I get it. I'm really sorry, but before you go storming out of here, you want to talk about a certain phone call I got from immigration a few years ago?<eos> I had just started dating Gloria.<eos> They were acting on an anonymous tip.<eos> It's very late.<eos> We have a very big day tomorrow.<eos> You know, Claire, I've really come to like Phil.<eos> I know.<eos> And the irony is, he would really love that skeleton gag.<eos> Try it out on him.
One keycard to access every room on the aforementioned floor, courtesy of my contact here.<eos> Do I even want to know?<eos> He's a chef in the hotel restaurant.<eos> He has rather exotic tastes.<eos> The package contains half a pound of Swedish moose cheese, one of the rarest and most expensive cheeses in the world, produced only three times a year by a single farm in the county of Vasterbotten.<eos> I did the owners a favor once, and they keep me in fresh supply.<eos> This is one of those "so many questions" moments.<eos> Why only three times a year?<eos> Well, I'm not sure.<eos> Having never milked a moose, I imagine one must catch it in the right mood.
What am I looking at?<eos> A few months ago, Auggie and I pulled the G.P.S. data off Henry Wilcox's car.<eos> It showed him going to a Camp Hillcrest in Virginia at least a dozen times.<eos> He said he took Jai camping there, which is true, but he's also been doing other things there.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like meeting with Deric Hughes.<eos> Hughes told his daughter to go there if anyone ever came asking, and I came asking.<eos> Annie, that girl can I.D. you.<eos> You should have let me talk to her.<eos> I gave you the laptop because I needed a specialist like Auggie to analyze it, and I am telling you about the cabin because I can't raid it.
Among other things.<eos> I knew Eddie was trouble.<eos> Just something off about him.<eos> You know where we can find him?<eos> I don't know-- his apartment?<eos> Uh, it's empty.<eos> No car registration with the DMV.<eos> That's weird. He has a car.<eos> I got the info on his employment application.<eos> Let me get it.
It was 596, actually.<eos> It was really cool.<eos> ♪ Happy first official joint duty ♪ ♪ BOLO to you.<eos> It's a very special moment.<eos> Blow out the candle.<eos> Make a wish. My BOLO on Eddie Macklin came in?<eos> Your wish came true.<eos> Airport police found his car in a long-term parking facility.<eos> Rock on.<eos> Let's go get it.
Oh, for Pete's sake.<eos> We want your blessing.<eos> My what?<eos> Your blessing.<eos> It's very important to Diane.<eos> And me.<eos> That we have your blessing.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it-it...<eos> What is with the 50 questions, do we have it or not?
I just...<eos> I didn't wanna... rub it in Matthew's face.<eos> If he has a problem with my name on a piece of paper, why should I be at this wedding?<eos> Because of me.<eos> Because... you're my friend and I want you to be there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, well, I wanna be there, too, but...<eos> Come on...<eos> Jackson, I can't go through with this if I don't have your blessing.<eos> Well, you have it.
I promise I won't pester you about the DVD.<eos> You can defecate in peace.<eos> That's a win for both of us.<eos> But... until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater.<eos> With nothing underneath it.<eos> That's stupid. Why?<eos> You say it's itchy and uncomfortable.<eos> I say situations like this make me feel the same way.<eos> I'm telling you, try the hanger.<eos> Put it on.
Oh, did I forget to tell you?<eos> That store went out of business years ago.<eos> Really?<eos> How those nipples feeling, chief?<eos> Penny, can we please get our drinks?<eos> Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.<eos> At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.<eos> Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.<eos> I scraped gum off the bottom of that table.<eos> Only 'cause my manager saw me put it there.
I love you, Penny!<eos> Hey, what're you working on?<eos> I'm thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.<eos> That's a pretty cool idea.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's great you're here.<eos> I'd love to get an engineer's opinion.<eos> Sure.<eos> This chair is squeaky.<eos> Now, do I fix it or get a new one?
Yeah.<eos> It's great you're here.<eos> I'd love to get an engineer's opinion.<eos> Sure.<eos> This chair is squeaky.<eos> Now, do I fix it or get a new one?<eos> Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store.<eos> And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool.<eos> Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved.<eos> Ah... And I'd just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn't use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.
Oh, I'm just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon's stupid face when he sees that I didn't let this get to me.<eos> Sheldon's not here.<eos> Why don't you take the sweater off?<eos> Th-Th-There's a principle at stake!<eos> Which is?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Is that sweater made of bees?<eos> Come on, take it off.

stop and smell the flowers.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Please.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Oh, it's so good to see you.<eos> You, too.<eos> Please, sit.<eos> I, uh, I got you a cappuccino.<eos> I remembered it was your favorite.
Since September.<eos> Where were you before?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Just curious.<eos> What brings you here?<eos> I'm selling... my grandmother's house.<eos> She died last month.<eos> No. Not for her.<eos> I hit a sparrow.<eos> - Can you see it?
Wonder what she saw in that guy.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.<eos> Broad shoulders, good hair.<eos> Wonder what she sees in Leonard.<eos> How's it going out there?<eos> Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum.<eos> I kick it when he's not looking.
pineapple powder. I'll have to check that out.<eos> Mind if I take a look at your wall safe?<eos> How did you know I have a wall safe?<eos> As part of the investigation, we confiscated photos of the homes that were cased.<eos> And as I mentioned earlier, yours was targeted.<eos> Yes, you did say that.<eos> It's over here.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Did the safe come with the house?<eos> No, I had it installed.

I know why the Horseman came here tonight.<eos> He was looking for his skull.<eos> Why would he think it was here?<eos> The Masons are the traditional guardians of secrets and artifacts for the side of good.<eos> The Horseman would've assumed that his skull was in their possession.<eos> When the Horseman came last time, Katrina warned us that if he got his skull, the other three<eos> Horsemen of the Apocalypse would rise.<eos> The Horseman is here to hasten the end of days, just as he tried before.<eos> We must retrieve his head before he does.<eos> And this time... we destroy it.
You need to trust us.<eos> The D.A.'s on line one.<eos> I'll call her from the car.<eos> Stick around.<eos> I won't be gone long.<eos> Paul?<eos> Hey. Thanks for coming in so late.<eos> No problem.<eos> Unfortunately, we still can't figure out what kind of processes were done to the skull.<eos> We put it through the woodwork.
Don't worry.<eos> I have one arm but I clean like I have three.<eos> I put on more makeup, then I start.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't realize when I ordered a cleaning lady I had to specify I wanted one with two arms.<eos> You can't afford two arms.<eos> You said you wanted a good price.<eos> Half the arms, half the price.<eos> Is that how she lost the arm, Sophie?<eos> You cut it off so we could get a discount?
oh, boone.<eos> what's that nimrod doing here?<eos> hey, peralta.<eos> hey, boone.<eos> what are you doing here, you nimrod?<eos> uh, there was a fire.<eos> big question is, what are you doing here?<eos> what, did somebody call in a missing doughnut?<eos> uh, actually someone reported they couldn't find your head.<eos> but we found it.
gino bianucci, you're under arrest for arson. yes!<eos> said it first.<eos> real mature.<eos> very mature.<eos> off we go. so what'd you think of ropesburg?<eos> it's, uh...quaint.<eos> it's whack, and you know it. their number-one crime is tricycle theft.<eos> there's a bakery attached to the precinct.<eos> come on, santiago.<eos> you never would've taken that job, so why'd you even care that they offered it to me?
Them.<eos> Um... Yeah, they're, uh, friends of my wife.<eos> Okay, well, I'm sorry to have bothered you.<eos> Uh, can I just trouble you for a glass of water?<eos> I've been driving in the car all day, I just...<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I understand the President's going to New York tomorrow.<eos> - Do you have his full itinerary?<eos> - They just issued it to us.
Meaning they're Secret Service.<eos> Finch... who the hell is this guy?<eos> Are they sparrows, dad?<eos> Mm-mm-mm.<eos> Oh, close. Tell you what.<eos> You help me with the truck, and I'll help you with the birds, hmm?<eos> Okay.<eos> Engine's flooded, and I can't for the life of me figure out why.<eos> Where's the socket wrench?<eos> I had it right here in my hand.
I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, I'm trying to figure out if there's a plan "B" we can try.<eos> But I don't even know if he's gonna...<eos> I heard your sheep did great.<eos> Congrats.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Actually, the sheep died.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Did you need the printer?<eos> Yeah, but if you need it more...
No!<eos> I haven't had enough surgery.<eos> I have waited and waited for you to get back in the O.R., and damn it, enough is enough.<eos> I'm here to study surgery, and I'm being left behind.<eos> And I deserve better than this.<eos> So I...<eos> I'm just tired.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - We need to do Elliot's procedure once more, to get the samples I need.<eos> And you will perform it, beginning to end.
They were removed.<eos> Where have they gone?<eos> Oh, wow. That's an intense line of questioning, snuffles.<eos> Do not call me that!<eos> "Snuffles" was my slave name.<eos> You shall now call me snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.<eos> Okay, snowball, just calm down, okay?<eos> You're scaring me.<eos> Scaring you?<eos> Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund? Uhhh...
Morty, can you get to the left nipple?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I'm hoping I can get to both of 'em, Rick.<eos> No, Morty, I'm talking about Reuben's left nipple.<eos> We need to get to the left nipple!<eos> The body is decaying.<eos> The arterial transit system is useless.<eos> We can try the service shuttle.<eos> It's connected to the skeletal system.<eos> That's why we call it the bone train.
The only thing that's changed are my feelings for Mary.<eos> The man I knew put his country first... above all else.<eos> I so admired that about you.<eos> Your sense of duty.<eos> That's the man I fell in love with.<eos> It's the man I love still.<eos> Olivia, you shouldn't say these things.<eos> I have to.<eos> Francis, this year has been torture.<eos> And not because of the scandal, but because I had to endure it without you.
A fiber-optic tree.<eos> It's way better for the environment than a real one.<eos> Not if the environment is my living room.<eos> Look, I admit, it takes some getting used to, but so did Greek yogurt.<eos> Now I can't even remember how the old stuff tastes.<eos> Why do we keep changing things that don't need changing?<eos> Christmas is real trees and eggnog. Perry Como and Bing on the hi-fi.<eos> - Now you're just making up words.<eos> - I'm drawing a line in the sand.<eos> We're gonna get a real tree and cut it down like I did when I was a kid.
♪ Men. ♪ How you feeling?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> Uh, well, we need to fill out this paperwork.<eos> So, uh, first name, Nadine.<eos> This is awkward. I don't know your last name.<eos> It's H-O-R-E.<eos> H-O-R-E.<eos> Like "hooray"?<eos> No, like "whore."<eos> You think I should change it?
You don't look... 40. ♪ Men. ♪<eos> So, so, you were a guy?<eos> With, you know, an Adam's apple and facial hair, and the whole kit and kaboodle?<eos> Yep, I had a kit and two kaboodles.<eos> So, so, how did you get that?<eos> I mean, did you have to get a donor?<eos> 'Cause I've never seen that box to check on a driver's license.<eos> Actually, uh, I-I... I donated my own organ.<eos> You see, what they do, they take your penis, all right?<eos> They slice it right down the middle... Oh!
BARNEY:<eos> "Let's get this party started."<eos> Hey, can you push the button?<eos> Do not touch that button.<eos> Just give it a little push.
BARNEY:<eos> "Let's get this party started."<eos> Hey, can you push the button?<eos> Do not touch that button.<eos> Just give it a little push.<eos> Don't push it.<eos> Just push it a little.<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> Half of it, halfway, halfway...<eos> Don't even touch it.
Exactly.<eos> It's a third thing that didn't exist until one was driven deep inside the other.<eos> And yes, I know what I just said.<eos> Where'd you go to culinary school?<eos> - Can you keep a secret?<eos> - Of course.<eos> A Denny's in Boston.<eos> I worked the late shift; there's a lot of time to screw around.<eos> - Where's the Boston accent?<eos> - I dropped it.
He's married, and Caroline has this weird thing in her head that she has to marry someone who isn't married.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> I'm not really good with any languages.<eos> They think it's because I got hit by three cars.<eos> FYI, if you ever get hit, just stay down.<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> I got you and me salads.<eos> Girls' lunch.<eos> Well, I usually just have peanut butter and crackers in the dark...<eos> I hear so much about salad I've always wanted to try it.
He told me he'd kick me out if I didn't repent for being such a lousy roommate.<eos> Apparently he's the one washing my dirty dishes after I put them in the sink.<eos> Well, Ed, who did you think was washing them?<eos> Not something I dwelled on.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> All right, you got me.<eos> Sometimes when you're not around, I like to use your giant spoon as a spoon.<eos> It cracks me up.<eos> It is pretty funny.<eos> By the way, Mike from next door used it last week to fish a dead rat out of his Jacuzzi.
Why would you do that?<eos> - You're pathetic.<eos> - You know what?<eos> At least I'm trying to get laid on Christmas Eve instead of sitting in my office working.<eos> I wasn't working.<eos> I was playing Sims on my computer.<eos> And for your information, all the characters I created are having really hot sex right now.<eos> How are the graphics on that?<eos> ( Sighs ) Is this seriously what you're doing?<eos> I have a Christmas tree at home, but I can't bring myself to decorate it alone.
How are we gonna put it back?<eos> Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you stuffed the savior of man inside your jacket, Ed.<eos> All done.<eos> I give you Franken-Jesus.<eos> All right, I have an idea, but we're all gonna have to go.<eos> Ooh, a Christmas adventure.<eos> This is so much more fun than shoplifting.<eos> We've got to do it quick.<eos> My movie will be here in about 20 minutes.<eos> I ordered it on pay-per-view.
Fight your way out!<eos> Take it<eos> Protect the cargo!<eos> Charge forward!<eos> Laipi, get in<eos> Yes<eos> Sis, I got it<eos> Hurry, steal the wagon<eos> Tieyun, they stole the wagon<eos> Get it back
Come out<eos> Father<eos> I...<eos> Go home<eos> Let me warm this up for you<eos> No need<eos> This wine is not for me; it's for you<eos> On the first day you came to Golden Valley I asked Ao-tian to save this wine for you<eos> It was buried under the tree at the village entrance<eos> We planned to drink it together on your wedding day

You're in Africa, ladies.<eos> Hang on!<eos> You okay, Jo?<eos> That's them.<eos> We're in the right place.<eos> That's the matriarch in the pack, an Alpha female.<eos> She has a dick?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All females have a pseudo penis.<eos> They urinate, copulate, even give birth through it.
Have some tea, Madame.<eos> Swelling and bursting apart.<eos> Madame, I beg you.<eos> And other times...<eos> Other times, I see the boat tipping and I see him falling.<eos> And then I see him swimming away.<eos> Flopping up onto a bank, exhausted but happy.<eos> And I wonder, "Why couldn't it be that way?"<eos> Tea, Madame.<eos> Have my son bring it to me.
Gone?<eos> We'll see ourselves out.<eos> Just go.<eos> If I make grief an inconvenience...<eos> Perhaps it pains them to see you suffer.<eos> - You have a kind heart.<eos> - Oh, it's nothing, Madame.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not nothing.<eos> It's comfort, Laurent, and you give it gladly.
- Don't.<eos> We've dreamt of this moment for so long and now the dream's come true.<eos> Remember you said that you wanted to fall asleep in my arms and wake up with me warm beside you?<eos> Did I?<eos> Yes.<eos> And now we can.<eos> - Now that Camille is gone...<eos> - Oh, no. Why did you say his name?<eos> - What?<eos> You say it.

Get with the times, Gary.<eos> Your whole family has been meddling in my business.<eos> - Time to say goodbye, Gary.<eos> - Kip! Kira!<eos> - Lena, please, he's using you. - He's using all of us.<eos> OK, he's just jealous he couldn't have you.<eos> Tata.<eos> How could you do this?<eos> You think I'm actually in love with an alien?<eos> When she leaves your planet with my Blubonium, I'm gonna blow it up.
Gary, I could kiss your brain!<eos> Destabilizing the Blubonium was brilliant.<eos> I taught him everything he knows.<eos> He's still frozen.<eos> Grab a leg.<eos> I'm covered in slime.<eos> I can't do this!<eos> Come on!<eos> They're heading for the elevator.<eos> - Locking it down.
I made some modifications.<eos> You like them?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why aren't you moving? We're caught in a tractor beam.<eos> You've gotta get us out of it!<eos> It's not working.<eos> We're burning up!<eos> We gotta knock off that tractor beam.<eos> Nice one, Gary. How do we do that?<eos> We take it out at the source.
So proud of yourself.<eos> "I got an important tube."<eos> What?<eos> Well, what is it?<eos> Actually, it looks like you two don't need to concern yourselves with the red alert.<eos> It brings me no pleasure to inform you that because of your recent epic failure, you've both been suspended, you're off the case.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> What?<eos> Hold on a sec, we are the case.<eos> We're the ones who brought it in!
Roy, as punishment...<eos> "Punishment"?<eos> Yes.<eos> Fifty-three more years have been added to your term.<eos> Fifty-three years?<eos> That's a lot.<eos> This is honky-tonk bullshit.<eos> You just like having me around, don't you, Mildred?<eos> My hat.<eos> You went off and found it?
Liesel, I know you like it down here... but don't you think you should be outside a bit?<eos> I'm writing Mama a letter.<eos> Well, that's very good.<eos> Please tell her, from me, I could do without all the nagging.<eos> Not that mama.<eos> I see.<eos> What are you telling her?<eos> Everything.<eos> About you und Mama und Rudy.<eos> Can you send it for me?

I've always ironed his shirts in exactly the same way.<eos> Maybe they can't afford it any longer.<eos> They can't afford it?<eos> We can't afford it.<eos> It's another customer gone.<eos> And four mouths to feed.<eos> Well. It's two meals a day from now on, not three.<eos> That's all there is to it.<eos> I've made you a suit.<eos> I want you to wear it on your 14th birthday.
My God.<eos> Is he going to die?<eos> Shut up!<eos> I won't have that talk in this house.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I haven't starved us all for the better part of two years... just so that he could die.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Why is it your fault?<eos> It was my idea to build that snowman.<eos> Why did we build it?
What?<eos> Your chance to be a what?<eos> Ronin!<eos> Ozzy?<eos> Oh, come on, Ozzy.<eos> We had numbers, and we had the surprise part!<eos> How are we losing?<eos> Patience, son.<eos> The forest wasn't grown in a day.<eos> But we can destroy it in one.
You belong in the back of the pack!<eos> I mean racing!<eos> The best man wins.<eos> No other rules, nobody telling you what to do.<eos> You talk too much!<eos> And you ain't winning this race!<eos> Sorry, can't hear you!<eos> Going too fast!<eos> Hey. Nice old fleabag you got there.<eos> It's not the bird, it's how you ride it.
My name's Steve Madden.<eos> Yeah, we know who you are.<eos> Your name is on the box.<eos> Get the shoes.<eos> Show them the shoes.<eos> - Show them the shoes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Anyway, you know, this shoe is pretty cool.<eos> This is the Mary Lou, which is really the shoe that put me on the map.<eos> Without it, I wouldn't be here.
Sit down.<eos> Fasten it.<eos> - Right. Okay, I'll sit down...<eos> - I will do it for you.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'll do it for you.<eos> You gotta speak English.<eos> We don't understand this language you're speaking.<eos> I will help him with his seat belt.<eos> - You gotta put it on right.
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.<eos> Don't you fucking touch her, Jordan.<eos> I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!<eos> It's all right, baby.<eos> You and Daddy are gonna go on a little trip together, okay?<eos> - A little trip together.<eos> - Violet!<eos> Violet!<eos> - Get the key! Get the key!<eos> - I got it!
If he could act, he wouldn't be playing the Minotaur.<eos> Mr. Chambers?<eos> Kevin Harkins.<eos> Hey, Tony.<eos> Watch your head.<eos> What are you shooting?<eos> Monster movie.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Any good?<eos> Target audience will hate it.
Probably wants to fire me himself.<eos> He wants to give you the intelligence Star.<eos> You're getting the highest award of merit. .. ...of the Clandestine Services of these United States.<eos> Ceremony's on the 1 4th.<eos> If they push it a week, I can bring lan.<eos> That's his winter break.<eos> The op was classified, so the ceremony's classified.<eos> He can't know about it.<eos> Nobody can know about it.<eos> So they're just gonna give me an award and then they're gonna take it back.
Try to stay positive.<eos> I'm just gonna read it out loud, OK?<eos> Because if she says anything that's...<eos> - Is that too much to ask?<eos> - No.<eos> - I thought you were gonna read it.<eos> - OK. I'm sorry.<eos> "Dear Pat." Ahem.<eos> "It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as you can imagine,<eos> "but I'm glad you took the risk of getting it to me through Tiffany.
So I broke the tooth and bit into the capsule.<eos> And it... It burned all my insides.<eos> But I didn't die.<eos> Life clung to me like a disease.<eos> And then... I understood why I had survived.<eos> I needed to look in your eyes one last time.<eos> Well, I hope it was worth it.<eos> Mr. Silva, you're going to be transferred to Belmarsh Prison where you'll be remanded in custody until the Crown Prosecution Service deem you fit to stand trial for...<eos> Say my name.<eos> Say it.
It should have worked.<eos> It's invisible.<eos> It's an invisible goldfish.<eos> -Why is it invisible?<eos> -I have no idea.<eos> You can't tell anyone. You understand that, right?<eos> Not until we figure out how it works.<eos> -Promise?<eos> How are we supposed to see an invisible goldfish?<eos> Put your finger in. You can feel it.
I didn't say that.<eos> Who said I did?<eos> Toshiaki says it's your science fair project.<eos> If it was, I couldn't tell you.<eos> So it isn't, or it is?<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Do you have an invisible fish?<eos> Okay. But you have to keep it a secret.<eos> Swish your finger around.<eos> You can feel it.
I believe she learned how to do this sort of thing from her own mother.<eos> Specially made for Dolly!<eos> Really?<eos> Why?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr Owen Bigham to see you, ma'am.<eos> Mrs Thatcham, this is too dreadful of me.<eos> I know this is the last place in the world I ought to be at the present moment.<eos> The fact is, Dolly has got the ring.<eos> She took it to have it made smaller at the jeweller's.

Is there anything left for little old me, I wonder?<eos> - Breath like a dragon.<eos> - Well, thank heavens for my chauffeur.<eos> I can never remember my way through these tiny roads.<eos> Bella dear, this is Dolly's Owen.<eos> The groom is here before the wedding.<eos> Priceless.<eos> How do you do?<eos> He's here to get the ring.<eos> Dolly forgot to hand it over last night.
- Daphne?<eos> That's a name for a girl who is fair of face and fleet of foot.<eos> - This little one looks more like a Brunhilda.<eos> - Brunhilda?<eos> You know, sometimes, Dolly, you should call things as they really are.<eos> Dolly!<eos> Come on.<eos> - Did they find the ring?<eos> - Evelyn saved the day.<eos> Joseph spotted it first.
- Please, Joseph, run upstairs and get mother's scarf out of the bottom drawer.<eos> The chest in my dressing room.<eos> - Please!<eos> - Dolly, dearest Dolly...<eos> Quickly, Joseph.<eos> A white lace scarf.<eos> Quickly!<eos> - Dolly?<eos> - Coming.<eos> Put it through there.
Let's get you tidied up and away from all these grown-ups.<eos> - Sorry, Aunt Bella.<eos> He's missed the boat.<eos> Let him go now, Hettie.<eos> - Now are you glad you came?<eos> - I couldn't have asked for more.<eos> David!<eos> Yes, so dreadfully disappointing you were not able to get over.<eos> Your lampshade was very much appreciated.<eos> Dolly's had it packed for South America.

Uh, how you present yourself as a woman. What's appropriate wear, cover your hair, this, that.<eos> Here I am on the train coming in from all parts out of London, and, you know, they've got this tiny little triangular sink in the bathroom on the train, and I'm washing all the make-up off.<eos> Anyway, one night I wasn't able to do that, and I came home in full regalia... red nails, fur coat, fully made up.<eos> And no sooner than I walked through the front door and closed it, he walked in behind.<eos> I turned around, he looked at me and said, "Ah, I catch you."<eos> Exodus was huge. That was our biggest album ever there.<eos> Just mash up Europe, and it's tearing down America.<eos> They're waiting for us.<eos> And then the American tour was canceled... because Bob was having problems with his toe.<eos> Somebody stepped on it with their spike boots.
Affection?<eos> This is crazy!<eos> Master?<eos> All men are idiots<eos> Viola!<eos> Viola, quiet!<eos> Viola, give it to me!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Where did you put the little China dog?<eos> I hid it from view because it's dreadful.
Now, what do I need?<eos> Just a little bit of this.<eos> That'll do.<eos> And now let's see.<eos> What have we here?<eos> Hey!<eos> A cake?<eos> - You don't want it?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I want it.
Bobble!<eos> ls something wrong with that basket?<eos> What?<eos> Tink?<eos> I just have to do this.<eos> No, no.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> We're just sad to see it go.<eos> Pretty basket.<eos> Honestly. Let it go!
Chicago's electric.<eos> - You were down there?<eos> - Voter registration.<eos> Cool.<eos> Did she say who she was going to the diner with?<eos> Would you like to watch my sister eat?<eos> No.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> How come the English knew all about the blues and we didn't?<eos> Yet it's been right here under our nose the whole time.
Got a pretty good lead on a school desk.<eos> There she is.<eos> We should go.<eos> I thought you were staying.<eos> I promised I'd take him somewhere.<eos> Can we... Can we borrow one from the fleet?<eos> Are you sure you don't want a fallout tablet for the road?<eos> That's okay, thanks.<eos> The car's a loan, Penny.<eos> I want to see it back here with you in it.
Should I... Should I disappear?<eos> No, stay here in the car.<eos> What happened?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Was she home?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> Did you knock?<eos> Why are we driving away?<eos> I wrote her a letter. I put it on her door.<eos> She should get it soon.
Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great.<eos> Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago?<eos> Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did.<eos> Someone will figure out a way to make this power source into a nuclear weapon.<eos> I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.<eos> To do what with it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Until we can guarantee its safety.<eos> And if we can't?<eos> Decommission it.

You good?<eos> Mr. Fox, would you like to brief the captain?<eos> Miss Tate's fully aware of the situation.<eos> And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I have to take responsibility for it.<eos> - Why?<eos> - We built it.<eos> You built the bomb?<eos> It was built as a fusion reactor.<eos> First of its kind.<eos> Bane turned the core into a bomb and removed it from the reactor.
Do you really think she told me where she was going?<eos> Joshua, are you an only child?<eos> - What does the file say?<eos> - It's incomplete.<eos> Yeah, well, sounds like me.<eos> I know you know art, but you seem unaware of my more provocative work.<eos> Major publications have said my art harkens back to the work of the original Bohemian masters who founded this community.<eos> And that's a quote.<eos> So what did I do to earn this reputation?<eos> I took what the world of art describes as a master style and I combined it with my own interpretation of the intense beauty of the natural world around me.
For godssake, Joe, I am late already.<eos> What's up?<eos> I got a call from that reporter.<eos> She was asking about Sixsmith.<eos> I see.<eos> You said she wasn't going to be a problem.<eos> Well, some problems are more resilient than others, Joe.<eos> – Where's the ruddy key?<eos> – He did not leave it in the ignition?<eos> His wife was driving, she took it the ruddy female took the key in with her!
- And I'll just be outside if you need me.<eos> They are going to be coming for me any second so I need to make this quick.<eos> You're going to find this hard to believe.<eos> But you are not the person you think you are now.<eos> If you are watching this, it means I have failed to escape.<eos> it means, it means they succeeded giving you a new name, a new identity, a new set of memories, everything, everything!<eos> Anything, you think you know about your life, it's not real!<eos> The most important thing for you to do now, is to get to my apartment at 549, Hisperion, Block D.<eos> I want to tell you more but I can't trust you yet!<eos> My only hope is, if you are me... you found the key and you know what to do with it!
I love you<eos> I'll still cook you.<eos> [DISTRICT BOUNDARY] [NO ACCESS BEYOND THIS POINT]<eos> [HIGH VOLTAGE]<eos> What are you gonna do with that when you kill it?<eos> Damn you, Gale!<eos> It's not funny!<eos> What are you gonna do with a 100-pound deer, Catnip?<eos> It's Reaping Day. The place is crawling with Peacekeepers.<eos> I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers.
I used to decorate the cakes down at the bakery.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> See?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, I think you have a shadow.<eos> Tomorrow, they'll bring you in one by one and evaluate you.<eos> This is important, because higher ratings will mean sponsors.<eos> This is the time to show them everything.<eos> There'll be a bow.<eos> Make sure you use it.
Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just can't afford to think like that.<eos> I have my sister.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I guess I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front, right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.<eos> There'll even be a bow there.<eos> Don't go for it.
I need you to focus.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> No. I need you to be ready. I need you to be ready.<eos> Come on, focus.<eos> Driver, stop.<eos> Okay, go.<eos> Wait, what about you?<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> It's the guys following us who are about to have a problem.<eos> When a dog has a bone... the last thing you want to do is try and take it from him.
If you can, take the case with you.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Is it open? Yeah.<eos> Do you see a map?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take the map.<eos> You'll see a scale on the top in kilometers.<eos> Do you see it?<eos> Yeah, I see it.<eos> Take a shoelace from one of my shoes in the closet. Use it as a guide.
-Justin Bieber.<eos> Justin Bieber. Hi.<eos> -Justin Bieber too. -Hi. Just kidding.<eos> Beth.<eos> -You want another drink? -Two.<eos> -One drink.<eos> -One drink.<eos> Hey, you've reached Jesse.<eos> Leave me a message. Hey, I still have a bunch of your shit.<eos> I'm just gonna drop it off.
I got Griffin.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> I feel younger already.<eos> You pathetic waste of Boglodite flesh.<eos> I'd kill you right now, if I didn't value my own life.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Look at you.<eos> Every mistake I've ever made, just waiting to happen.<eos> What happened to my arm?<eos> You lose it, shot off by a human.
The golden mask of a pharaoh's concubine and the sacred smiling Buddha were passed in an auction today, affected by the increasing international uproar.<eos> Police.<eos> Do you know these people?<eos> In breaking news, MP Corporation has announced it has won the right to auction off the bronze Dragon head.<eos> The piece will go to market as soon as possible.<eos> From now on, forever and ever, I will never bother you again.<eos> We found it! We found it!<eos> You found what?<eos> The Dragon head.<eos> MP will put it up for auction next week.

We found it!<eos> You found what?<eos> The Dragon head.<eos> MP will put it up for auction next week.<eos> Yeah, and they've had it all along.<eos> That bonus, we could've never gotten it.
You can see the volcano behind me. The Dragon head might be consumed by it.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, our mid-day deadline is fast approaching, and I have yet to receive an opening bid.<eos> If the auction is aborted, MP will dump the bronze Dragon head into the active volcano in front of us.<eos> At this stage, I haven't received any opening bids.<eos> Fair warning.<eos> Fair warning.<eos> Last chance.<eos> This item is unsold!<eos> Boss! The Dragon head's been taken off the auction block.<eos> Dump it!
Last chance.<eos> This item is unsold!<eos> Boss! The Dragon head's been taken off the auction block.<eos> Dump it!<eos> All right, guys!<eos> Let's do this!<eos> It's really happened.<eos> They've started the mission.<eos> Looking at the three skydivers, we can clearly see one of them is holding the Dragon head.<eos> They're dumping it! They're dumping it!
Well done, sir.<eos> Hey!<eos> Wah-hey, Captain!<eos> Fair play to you, sir.<eos> Wah-hey!<eos> This is our most unexpectedly heartwarming adventure ever.<eos> You'll swing for this!<eos> Curse you!<eos> And after you've done swinging, I'll chop your head off!<eos> I'll put it in a cannon and fire it into the sun!
I feel like he may have deleted a few things.<eos> I want to bring this blanket because... I don't want him to be cold.<eos> It's so cold in there.<eos> Hey.<eos> Honey.<eos> Meet you there.<eos> Hey, Nina!<eos> - What's up?<eos> - I got a call from CNN.<eos> Their office saw your piece, they wanna put it in a special.
That was Ben. He can't find something.<eos> Yes, Mom, were excellent tenants.<eos> We're taking good care of your investment home.<eos> Your parents should be happy they found renters especially responsible ones like us.<eos> We're still settling in but I got new curtains for the bedroom and I ordered a...<eos> Oh, son of a bitch!<eos> You know what, I gotta go.<eos> Give Dad a kiss? Okay.<eos> My cactus.<eos> It's dead. So we'll return it.

So far, none of the mold inspectors can come by for at least a week.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm gonna wash up.<eos> You wanna go first?<eos> I'm gonna keep searching.<eos> We're attempting to contain and entrap the entity we manifested a few years ago.<eos> This is where our experiment will be happening.<eos> We'll use these devices to detect our entity when he makes his appearance.<eos> The four of us will be wearing these headsets.<eos> They'll capture our belief and channel it into here.
Utilizing our equipment, I'm going to amplify the brainwaves of the participants.<eos> There'll be four people sitting around the table but this will make it seem like four thousand.<eos> And all of this concentrated energy will be focused into there.<eos> My modern and altered version of a psychomanteum, or apparition chamber.<eos> The electric current acts as an amplifier as it runs through the cages.<eos> Entities manifest themselves through energy.<eos> The greater the energy, the greater the chance of manifestation.<eos> We miscalculated the first time but now we'll be able to trap the spirit within the psychomanteum.<eos> Greg, where are you?<eos> Our effort to entrap it has failed.
Oh, well, I guess I can tell you.<eos> Last night at the ball, I had a revelation.<eos> Uh, what do you mean?<eos> Last night I fell, Cinderella... fell in love with a girl so beautiful she makes the stars blush.<eos> Everything about her exudes feminine perfection, incomparable grace...<eos> charming and quite slim. A bit like you, really, except she's...<eos> Oh, you should have seen her in action.<eos> Speaking of which... ha ha...<eos> this is her tooth.<eos> She lost it while bravely fighting the intruders by my side.
All right, just get back in the car.<eos> Just stay as still and quiet as possible.<eos> - What, are you fucking insane?<eos> - Just listen, listen. Why don't you jump in the water and do a couple of laps?<eos> All right, just listen to me. You gotta keep still, okay?<eos> The more you scream, the more the shark's gonna come.<eos> Hey, hey, just get back in and wait.<eos> I'm gonna get the shark to come to me.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> When I get it over here, you swim like hell for my van over there.
It's a cargo hold.<eos> Janek?<eos> Are you seeing this?<eos> How many is there, Shaw?<eos> Thousands.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Ravel, give me those schematics.<eos> Putting it on the table now.<eos> Strip away the dome.<eos> Isolate that area, bring it up.
First, a threat at the president.<eos> You're confident you can handle whatever it comes up?<eos> Now an attack on the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.<eos> Arthur Rapp?<eos> Arthur Rapp, yes.<eos> Where?<eos> Nike, North Korea, while being interviewed on television.<eos> It's on all the channels.<eos> Director Rapp, will this change your policy on the yuan?<eos> The yuan is uncharacteristically inflated, which makes it unstable and eventually it will drop, and when it...
Yes.<eos> And each day since the Lorax left, I've sat here regretting everything I've done, staring at that word, "unless," and wondering what it meant.<eos> But now I'm thinking...<eos> Well, maybe you're the reason the Lorax left that word there.<eos> Me?<eos> Why would he leave that for me?<eos> Because unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better.<eos> It's not.<eos> The last Truff ula seed.<eos> You need to plant it, Ted.
You know what I would love right now, Mrs. Wiggins?<eos> A delicious cookie.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Teddy and I'll stay here and talk.<eos> Sure, why don't you go ahead and adopt him?<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> That was a joke.<eos> I was just joking.<eos> I'll get your cookie.<eos> I know you have it, Ted.

I guess you wouldn't mind us checking your room.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Morty!<eos> McGurk!<eos> Find the seed!<eos> No, you can't go up there!<eos> Guys, this is ridiculous.<eos> Hey!<eos> No, you can't come in my room!<eos> Find it!
No, no, no!<eos> Morty!<eos> McGurk!<eos> Find the seed!<eos> No, you can't go up there!<eos> Guys, this is ridiculous.<eos> Hey!<eos> No, you can't come in my room!<eos> Find it!<eos> Find it!
Right?<eos> I say we tell this kid what we think about that seed!<eos> People, come on!<eos> You!<eos> Get out there right now and get these people on my side, or else you're fired!<eos> Go on, tell them what you think.<eos> You don't know me, but my name's Cy<eos> I'm just the O'Hare delivery guy<eos> But it seems like trees might be worth a try<eos> So I say let it grow
I told you he wouldn't come.<eos> He's too busy to taking it ezee.<eos> Racers ready.<eos> - Not that busy apparently.<eos> Civilian, this is restricted area.<eos> Hurricanes and new recruits only.<eos> But that's why I'm here, to try out.<eos> Look, my name is Kai.<eos> - I don't have your name on my list.<eos> Can you just put it on there?
Yardley, on the other hand, well...<eos> Forensic report says that the sheriff was stabbed between 2 and 3 AM.<eos> Yep.<eos> Like I told you, I was with... my Uncle Tyree doing lawn work In Ormond Beach at the time.<eos> Lawn work?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You mean stealing? Yes, sir.<eos> Stealing sod off a golf course.<eos> A developer paid through the teeth for that shit.<eos> We sold it and we didn't make it back to the river till sunrise.
This is not me apologizing, you dig?<eos> I just don't like to see you sad.<eos> Yardley told their editor about the new evidence from Ormond Beach.<eos> This was enough to show injustice in the legal system of Lately and enough for a good story.<eos> Yardley wanted to get out of town and Ward knew it.<eos> All these peanuts on the floor.<eos> Pigs, Bunch of pigs living around here.<eos> Sick of this shit.<eos> I can't find Mama's ring.<eos> Oh, well, a nigger must have come in the middle of the night and stole it.
Anyway, go on back outside.<eos> Well, Ward's out there. You gonna come see him?<eos> Are you trying to get me fired?<eos> I miss you.<eos> I got something for you.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> This came for you about a month ago.<eos> She told him to tell...<eos> She told him not to let you see it.<eos> Jack, I can't believe I'm finally writing you this letter or if it will get to you or whether you'll even read it.
Well, let's do it that way.<eos> Modestly.<eos> (Robert Randolph The Family Band:<eos> "Is not Nothing Wrong With That")<eos> May I ask, Mr. Zettl, whether you are V-or L-carpenter?<eos> Uh, V or L?<eos> I'm not a joiner.<eos> I'm looking for a table for me.<eos> So I ask you, yes.<eos> Have it generally more full or rather empty?
If we could somehow find a way to get Alex to think that Nina betrayed her...<eos> No, what we need to do is get help.<eos> We're gonna walk down the hallway, and get Detective Ross on board. That's what we have to do.<eos> It's a great idea.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> My name is Nina Layton.<eos> Sara Ryan asked to see me?<eos> This wine is so good.<eos> I have more in the cellar.<eos> I'll go get it.
Have you ever been convicted of espionage?<eos> Just answer yes or no, we'll get through this really quickly.<eos> No.<eos> Sedition, or conspiracy to commit espionage, sedition, treason?<eos> Together?<eos> I received your shipping application, Mr...<eos> Lakowski.<eos> Mr. Lakowski.<eos> Señor Lakowski, I'm getting you a 20-foot standard dry.<eos> Would you like us to load it?
Could be.<eos> Watch your step.<eos> Just put the carpet cleaner in the trunk.<eos> You got it?<eos> Just put it right there, that's fine.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> The van in D-7.<eos> What about it?<eos> We're taking it apart now.
- How?<eos> - You got to shave one testicle.<eos> All the crabs go over to the other testicle, you got to light the hair on fire on that one.<eos> When they all go scurrying out, you take an ice pick and you fucking stab every single last one of them.<eos> The Allied armed forces have been ordered to suspend offensive action.<eos> The proclamation of V-J Day must await upon the formal signing of the surrender terms by Japan.<eos> The Japanese delegation lines up on the opposite side of the surrender table from the Alliance.<eos> A war which had entered its eighth terrible year in China, which had raged for 3 years and 9 months for America and Britain, which was the brutal, costly, eastern half of the most horrible worldwide war in human history,<eos> General MacArthur speaks.<eos> Let us pray that peace be now restored to the world, and that God will preserve it always.
The war is over, peace is here.<eos> Move it in. Move it in.<eos> Next table, next table.<eos> Move it in.<eos> You men are blessed with the rejuvenating powers of youth.<eos> The responsibilities of peace time must now be considered.<eos> You can start a business:<eos> filling station, grocery or hardware store.<eos> Get a few acres of land and raise some chickens go back to school.<eos> Undoubtedly, there will be people on the outside who will not understand the condition you men have, or will think it a rather shameful condition.
Good.<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> - Yeah, good.<eos> I gather myself.<eos> You'll be my guinea pig and protege.<eos> Informal processing.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> Say your name.<eos> - Freddie Quell.<eos> - Say it again.

- You can understand skepticism... - Yes! - ...can you not?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> For without it, we'd be positives and no negatives, therefore zero charge.<eos> - We must have it.<eos> - Good science by definition allows for more than one opinion, does it not?<eos> Which is why our gathering of data is so far-reaching.<eos> Otherwise, you merely have the will of one man, which is the basis of cult.<eos> Is it not?<eos> 'Tis, 'tis.<eos> And thankfully, we are, all of us, working at breakneck speeds and in unison towards capturing the mind's fatal flaws and correcting it back to its inherent state of perfect.
She swore that she'd be good to me.<eos> She spent my money fast and free!<eos> The sailor was our captain, he was a mighty dog, served out to all the company a double share of grog.<eos> Everyone!<eos> A-roving, a-roving, a-roving's been my ruin,<eos> I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid.<eos> You can do whatever you want as long as I don't find out.<eos> And as long as no one that I know knows about it.<eos> Other than that, stop with this idea.<eos> Put it back in its pants.
You don't remember?<eos> - Just say your name.<eos> - You're drunk.<eos> You have to say your name.<eos> And you blinked, infringement, back to the start.<eos> Now, say your name.<eos> Winn.<eos> - Now say your full name.<eos> - Winn Manchester.<eos> - Say it again.
With Rome's blessing, the church bells could be ringing again within a month.<eos> My brother died for this.<eos> For what?<eos> Mi General, what should we do?<eos> We will defeat this government, we will overthrow Calles, and we will establish a democratic government that respects the rights of the people!<eos> Especially the basic right to worship God in peace.<eos> And with God on our side, we will prevail.<eos> I wish I had your faith.<eos> Jose's faith.<eos> I don't know where to find it.
Did the gringo help?<eos> No, it was just me!<eos> Get him!<eos> Caracas.<eos> Think you can fool me you little fuck! ?<eos> Get off her, you son of a bitch!<eos> I'm not done with you!<eos> What did you idiots do! ?<eos> This room was built for me!<eos> Now you're bleeding all over it
Does this little show have a point? Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.<eos> And I'm sure that your boss is going to be sending a team across the street right now.<eos> Hold on hold on, Nick. We are not ready yet.<eos> Yeah. Right now. - Are you fun jerking it around?<eos> - Package all. Fast.<eos> - Are you trying to manipulate me?<eos> - No. I'll just,<eos> Two years ago, I'm the one<eos> Real simple. Escort David Englander there up to the chapel corp with the "Monarch" diamond.<eos> Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
Hey Mercer.<eos> You want to take a look at these.<eos> He had bomb kinetics in his cell.<eos> Angie, You're with me.<eos> I see a mass of wires.<eos> Coming out of a circuit.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, Find the main processor.<eos> Like a big hole around it.<eos> - You found it?

I am not glad.<eos> - I'm so glad.<eos> The coach is waiting.<eos> - Receptions... projects, talk, plans, intrigue, that's not science.<eos> And what, may I ask, is science?<eos> - A man, alone.<eos> On his desk, before him, a sheet of paper.<eos> A pencil in his hand, clear skies ahead.<eos> If he does not surrender... before understanding something, that is science.<eos> And what if the man at the desk leaves it and goes travelling?
- I didn't get the girl.<eos> - Ain't that the story of your life? - Yeah.<eos> From what I'm reading on her vitals here, it don't look good.<eos> There's no way for you to get back to her even if she's not already dead.<eos> M. S. One is falling out of the sky, Snow.<eos> You gotta get out.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Get to dock 9.<eos> There's an ORAM engineering suit there.<eos> Put it on and get outside.
No, by the smell.<eos> Mother and Father are away, but I insist you stay.<eos> Miss Macintosh and I shall prepare a meal for you.<eos> The energy in this town is amazing.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You really feel like anything's possible here...<eos> You could meet fabulous people, exchange ideas, fall in love, have intense but brief adventures...<eos> You know, all that.<eos> I hear you and your friend have a little dog.<eos> You didn't bring it? No.
Can we at least put the gun down now?<eos> Thanks, Clayton.<eos> Bye.<eos> It's a microchip.<eos> What?<eos> That was my guy from MI6.<eos> Wade got his hands on a microchip.<eos> And what was on it?<eos> Only Wade knew, but I think it's safe to assume that's why he hooked up with Frost.<eos> To sell it.
But you wouldn't know anything about that, right?<eos> You got a city posting.<eos> Yeah, nightlife, beaches.<eos> Little ladies running around everywhere.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm jealous.<eos> You got coffee?<eos> Yeah, it's in the cupboard.<eos> Where?<eos> Want me to get it?
- Are you nuts?<eos> - It disgusts me.<eos> I'm not into shit.<eos> Sweetie, everything's fine.<eos> Don't get mad, but I thought he'd be a little bigger.<eos> - Jack was well hung, no?<eos> - His doctor never said a thing.<eos> A micropenis often goes undiagnosed.<eos> What is this bullshit?<eos> Maybe it's just small. Let's measure it.
Hi, girls.<eos> Can I get a pic?<eos> Sure.<eos> Dad?<eos> Oh, hey, Dad.<eos> Hey, Jim.<eos> I'm just going to run out for a sec.<eos> I was just watching your old Bar Mitzvah tape.<eos> I got your Jew scarf!<eos> Give it back, Stifler.
So you get to choose who lives and who dies.<eos> A great man once said...<eos> "What we do, we do not for ourselves..."<eos> "not for one man, but for the good of all mankind!"<eos> Not all mankind, Abraham.<eos> Abe?<eos> May I have my husband back?<eos> He's all yours, Mrs. Lincoln.<eos> Henry only saw the struggle his way.<eos> But I began at last to see it another.
You have got to eat, Abe.<eos> You're only human.<eos> Come along, Willie.<eos> Willie.<eos> Willie.<eos> If you do this, there is no turning back, Abe.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm trying to protect the freedom of a nation.<eos> If this war is truly a stand against evil... then let it stand for something.<eos> If it is a war for the freedom of man... why not give all men a reason to fight it?
Into the maelstrom that flows south of the Galapagos.<eos> That's where we're headed.<eos> - I've never heard of anything like that.<eos> - Please. Look ...<eos> Have faith, everything will be okay.<eos> I have lots of faith.<eos> The problem is I also have a sextant!<eos> The Galapagos maelstrom creates waves over nine meters high - And its powerful roar can be heard from ten miles away.<eos> That's a nice picture.<eos> We need to get it higher.

I'm pulling off.<eos> Shit!<eos> Shit.<eos> Hard right.<eos> Two minutes, man.<eos> They're watching us.<eos> Yes?<eos> Go two blocks.<eos> Look for a fish store.<eos> Okay, I see it.
- For what?<eos> For...<eos> - Yes.<eos> The cookie!<eos> - The cookie!<eos> I got it.<eos> The cookie!<eos> I'm telling you, the power's in the cookie.<eos> So, how do we control the cookie?<eos> By putting it in the cookie jar, clasping the lid on tight, and leaving it in there.
- Yes.<eos> The cookie!<eos> - The cookie!<eos> I got it.<eos> The cookie!<eos> I'm telling you, the power's in the cookie.<eos> So, how do we control the cookie?<eos> By putting it in the cookie jar, clasping the lid on tight, and leaving it in there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Until some little boy actually grows up and earns it.
Don't cut me off, Mike.<eos> That's what Gail do, I don't like that.<eos> - Why's he so sensitive?<eos> - All right, Dom, either way, once a woman's into you, she'll put up with anything.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> - Only if you're putting it on her right.<eos> All right. That's...<eos> Come on, man.<eos> - I'm gonna go clean the ball off.<eos> - Bennett, just wipe it off.
- I was gonna tell you.<eos> - Were you gonna tell me?<eos> Yes, I was gonna tell you.<eos> So, was any of it real?<eos> Any of it?<eos> The wining, the dining? Calling me your girlfriend?<eos> Or was that all just to get the cookie?<eos> Wow.<eos> You win, congratulations.<eos> You got it, right?
Oh, my knee!<eos> Man, you better calm down.<eos> He put his balls on my head.<eos> Where's my help on defense?<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Bennett!<eos> Jeremy!<eos> I'm trying to get my ball back!<eos> Can I have the ball, please?<eos> Just let them keep it. Let them keep it.
Strange faces peering through the veil?<eos> And I'll bet no one told you about the witch's curse, did they?<eos> Actually, we're learning about it in school.<eos> I'm a tree!<eos> There's something you really need to know.<eos> This is the most important thing you will ever hear.<eos> The fate of everyone depends on it!<eos> Now, listen close.<eos> The witch's curse is real!<eos> And you're the one who has to stop it.
I got to keep you ladies warm.<eos> Why don't you go help Daddy? Bye.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You're leaving. Yeah, swing shift calls.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, good to see you.<eos> So, wait, where did you guys meet?<eos> You're looking at it.<eos> Really? Yeah. This is where we went on our first date.<eos> He asked me out to dinner, and before I know it, he's, you know, spearing a fish and cooking it over a campfire like a caveman, and I'm just sitting there in my white taffeta dress and my pearls,
It really hurt me.<eos> Kirby, I'm really sorry about what happened.<eos> I didn't know how to handle it.<eos> But I think I do now and that's why I'm here.<eos> My life right now, it's totally ruined.<eos> Okay?<eos> I practically burned down my whole neighborhood.<eos> Probably bankrupt my parents. I'll be in debt until I die. But the only thing that I care about fixing right now is this.<eos> So, I'm sorry.<eos> If you're still mad, I get it but if you are talking to me by my next birthday I'd really like to spend it with just you.
- You Italian?<eos> - No.<eos> Why?<eos> Never mind. Take her to Benihana.<eos> John, look, don't you think after four years maybe she's hoping for something more than dinner?<eos> Like what?<eos> I don't know, but if it were me, I'd be expecting a proposal.<eos> Come on, nobody's expecting anybody to propose.<eos> I mean, marriage isn't... Isn't love enough? I submit that love is enough.<eos> You can put the ring in her ass, let her fart it out.
THE PATIENCE STONE<eos> Al-Qahhar...<eos> Al-Qahhar...<eos> Try to hold your breath.<eos> Just once.<eos> If you're able to breathe, you can hold your breath.<eos> Hold it!
A diabolic sensation?<eos> Diabolic?<eos> No.<eos> Ever since he was wounded and I tell him everything,<eos> I feel delivered of a burden.<eos> Strange, isn't it?<eos> What you're saying reminds me of my childhood.<eos> My father talked about a stone.<eos> A magical and legendary stone.<eos> He'd say, "If you find this stone, set it down before you, "tell it of your suffering and your secrets. "The stone listens.

"It listens to all your secrets.<eos> "It hears everything.<eos> "And, one day, "the stone shatters.<eos> "It falls to pieces.<eos> "And, that day, you're delivered, "delivered of all your pain."<eos> What's it called?
You got to have each other's backs.<eos> If Montero even looks at you sideways, you pull out, you get it?<eos> When you go in, you're gonna be mostly by yourselves.<eos> You'll have each other and this bug.<eos> Click the top of that pen, you're transmitting.<eos> It'll make it through most scans and has a range of 3 miles.<eos> Michael, Michael...<eos> please don't break it.<eos> Red tape is brutal at the Agency these days.<eos> I'll guard it with my life.
Yuck!<eos> Yuck!<eos> Stop joking, all right?<eos> You've never jerked off?<eos> Okay, come with me.<eos> Where are you taking me to?<eos> The Rape Center?<eos> This is silly.<eos> Okay...<eos> Take your penis out and put it in your hands.
Don't push it.<eos> I'm gonna need a boat, your fastest boat.<eos> The Fallen One lives far across the ocean.<eos> Where?<eos> Well, put me on the deck of the boat and I'll show you.<eos> Your ship awaits.<eos> Fetch my lucky cape.<eos> AGENOR:<eos> Do you know why this is my lucky cape, me old mate?<eos> Because the first time I wore it, I sprouted a beard.
Stand firm!<eos> [MOUTHS INDISTINCTLY]<eos> So this is what a father would go through for his son?<eos> Brother.<eos> I do forgive you.<eos> You look 10,000 years younger.<eos> ZEUS:<eos> And feel it.<eos> Death was circling you.<eos> That was the last time I'll have the strength to chase it away.
Cool!<eos> I went there the other day, they have cherry tomatoes--<eos> The St. Jones?<eos> Yeah!<eos> They're so good!<eos> Amazing!<eos> And they sell them at a price that's not too...<eos> Extravagant?<eos> Right. Exactly what I was about to say.<eos> Congratulations! On your book. I just bought it.

I just bought it.<eos> Piece of shit, right?<eos> No, Laurence.<eos> I haven't read it yet. Haven't had the time.
Ever since we've been here I keep dreaming about her.<eos> - It's good to dream.<eos> It means you're working on your trauma.<eos> I don't have a trauma!<eos> You did that on purpose!<eos> You already have a tan.<eos> Shit, is that our backpack?<eos> Yes.<eos> - The tracking device!<eos> Go get it!

What, are you grossed out by money?<eos> So, this is the new den, and this is where I sit and watch TV all day long.<eos> Just wasting my Iife away. Thank God for Wellbutrin, right?<eos> I'm alone most of the time.<eos> Rick work a Iot?<eos> Well, he entertains clients at night or has affairs or...<eos> I'm kidding, of course.<eos> Are you?<eos> I have a dildo in here.<eos> Feel free to use it and know that it's clean because

It's my pleasure.<eos> Three can play at that game.<eos> There's a Kinko's 13 miles down the road.<eos> Go get copies.<eos> I will get more cards.<eos> I will be back.<eos> Come back and buy a zucchini.<eos> And we will build that casino.<eos> Carvin, do you have any idea where the deed is?<eos> No, I'll find it, because I use the think method.

None.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean you ain't going out.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> I'm responsible for these men's lives.<eos> I'll do what the hell I see fit.<eos> Besides, what if you got out there, and something major happened,<eos> Like you had to change your tampon?<eos> No offense, deputy.<eos> Then I'd change it, dad.
I mean, honestly, did he really think I would consider marrying him?<eos> A woman has standards, after all, and an exalted woman like myself has very high standards. - Interesting.<eos> - What is?<eos> Your response to his proposal.<eos> - What is that supposed to mean?<eos> - Consider the options.<eos> Well, this option has a receding hairline, smells like rotten eggs, and I wouldn't be caught dead with him.<eos> You've spent so much supporting your vanity, you can't afford to say no.<eos> Then why don't you snap your fingers and make me a chest of gold, hm?<eos> Everyone has magic within them but very few discover it and learn to spend it wisely. Trust me.
Why is a woman so warm?<eos> Why is my bed so cold?<eos> These are the questions. I'll never know.<eos> I'm a ranchero.<eos> And I don't know.<eos> The only thing I'll ever know for certain ls love.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Holy Mary, a white cat.<eos> This is a rare thing.<eos> Let me kill it.
Till you are sleeping And you will keep me close<eos> And rain And rain<eos> Will make the flowers Will make the flowers<eos> Grow<eos> Gavroche, will you do something for me?<eos> Anything.<eos> Without you, I'd have bitten the dust.<eos> Letter from the barricade.<eos> From the barricade?<eos> I'll take it.
The gentleman.<eos> Jimmy The Gent.<eos> And if Jimmy's coming to town, so is his briefcase.<eos> That briefcase is our holy grail, Dean.<eos> Fuck Eddie's 250.<eos> That's small change compared to what The Gent will be carrying.<eos> The briefcase could be a myth.<eos> It's not a myth.<eos> He keeps everything in there, old school.<eos> Don't trust no one with it.
This muppet could do us a favour."<eos> I've been wanting this fuck dead for years, I can't tell you.<eos> That was her plan.<eos> Pull the other one, kid.<eos> She's lovely to look at, but she's not Alfred Einstein, is she? You know what I mean?<eos> Babe, would you do us the honours? Sure, Eddie.<eos> You ungrateful little shit.<eos> You shoot my boss just to steal his money?<eos> I just worked out a riddle.<eos> Porsche, get the briefcase, put it in the safe.
- This is not supposed to be, Babe.<eos> - But it is. - And we're here.<eos> - And it's only been two months.<eos> All right, now, listen to me, we gotta give this a little bit of time to make sure that this is real.<eos> And if it is... we got some tough decisions ahead of us.<eos> Look at you, you're just the kinda guy my father told me to avoid like the plague.<eos> Looking at you and I hate to see you go in the middle of the night.<eos> Someday you'll be looking at me... Dunkin' my donuts, slurping' my coffee, - and you'll beg to get rid of me.<eos> - The easy Irish charm.<eos> Save it.
You're the doctor, right'?<eos> Who's that?<eos> - Future brother-in-law.<eos> - Nobody.<eos> Well, what's the emergency, Joe?<eos> We lost our dog.<eos> Yeah, actually, they call me Joseph, which I prefer.<eos> His wife talked to your deputy, but she didn't get too far.<eos> Yeah, that'd be Chaz.<eos> He wants my job, you know, if it didn't interfere with ski season or hunting season or getting drunk season.
Be quiet now.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Good girl.<eos> Items not long now.<eos> A DAY EARLIER<eos> Hej.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> I have an ID card for you.<eos> From bowling alley.<eos> She exchanged it for a pair of bowling shoes, or forgot.
- I just hope we're both ready. - You're a fool, Buckley.<eos> Are you threatening me in front of everyone?<eos> I'm not like you. You can't hurt me.<eos> I am the life force!<eos> I come with the wind and I go with the wind.<eos> Do you want me to hurt you?<eos> Get out of here now while you can.<eos> I don't want to interrupt anything but I'd really like to sit down.<eos> My arm is hurting.<eos> Then put it down.
Because you can't get hard without a Viagra?<eos> Is it because you don't think I'm sexy?<eos> I thought you'd think it was fun for me to super-size it for once.<eos> That is the worst birthday present you could ever give someone.<eos> I was just trying to go turbo for your birthday.<eos> My hard-ons are still in analog.<eos> This shit's digital.<eos> I don't want a turbo penis.<eos> I like your medium-soft one.<eos> Look, I can get it up.
Don't eat that cupcake.<eos> What?<eos> The one you just put into the sink.<eos> I saw you were hiding that.<eos> This cupcake?<eos> You think I'm going to eat this cupcake?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I so don't want this cupcake.<eos> Look.<eos> You're still going to eat it.
Yeah.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Good?<eos> You know, I actually made this one myself.<eos> Did you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The tiger, I did it on a piece of paper separately, and then I actually transferred it to the T-shirt.<eos> Wow.<eos> So, you stenciled on the tiger?<eos> I drew it on a piece of paper and then I transferred the drawing to the T-shirt.
Put your head up like a bad man!<eos> This is where you want to be!<eos> Look at me.<eos> Shit!<eos> - What you got? - Fuckin' search me.<eos> It's called Pity the Plight of Young Fellows.<eos> - Carol? - Yeah, darlin'?<eos> I've only gone and lost my fuckin' key, ain't I?<eos> Did ya?<eos> No, you didn't. You left it in the door.
# Dust yourself off That's when they knock you back down<eos> # Dust yourself off That's when they knock you back down # No backpack<eos> # Just a tramp making tracks<eos> # I'm cool like Keith<eos> # Making friends with the rats<eos> # Observing how they act They ain't beggin' for my scraps<eos> # They ain't cats # They'd rather wait Until I've turned my back, no turnin' back<eos> # Maybe now's the time To turn to crack I've learnt the facts<eos> # Way before I learned to rap # This place is mess<eos> # The people here they don't pray success They hate it, yes
Me too.<eos> -All right, great. I guess I'll see you.<eos> -See you, Dave.<eos> Come on.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, it's me. What are you doing?<eos> Sex.<eos> Here's what I know about sex.<eos> You ready?<eos> Sex is so much better before you've had it.
Kenny, the world's full of guys that never fucked up... and then they fucked up once and now they're doing time... so tonight's not the night to start, not when I'm with you.<eos> I never fucked anything up.<eos> Where's the fucking car?<eos> It's around the side. I thought you said<eos> Never mind what you thought I said. Move your big, dumb ass. He's going home.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Yeah, neither is he tonight. Never again, either.<eos> Come on, for Christ's sake. I want to get home early for a change.<eos> Put the dollar back.<eos> Put it back.
You been here, what, three days? What I hear, you've seen most of the ass in town.<eos> Well, I like it. it's, like, my hobby.<eos> Yeah, well, I couldn't fuck like that for three days. I get all fucked out.<eos> You want ass?<eos> There's no ass in the whole world... like a young Jewish girl that's hooking.<eos> I'm gonna keep that in mind.<eos> You take that to the bank.<eos> First time I met Sunny... she walked in the room, I got a fucking enormous hard-on.<eos> I could have fought five guys with this fucking prong I had.<eos> So fucking hard, the skin from under my eyes... just kinda went down into the cock so it could expand.
THE DEEP Inspired by true events.<eos> The six o'clock weather forecast. -You weren't so chirpy last night!<eos> Feed the poor thing well. We'll be out for a few days.<eos> The weather seems to have gone down.<eos> I just hope he's not changing direction and then picking up again, the bloody bastard.<eos> TO DAD FROM BATMAN BJARNI AND SPIDERMAN GILLI<eos> Don't mess it up. I folded everything.<eos> Did you pack my blue sweater?<eos> -Yes, it's in there.<eos> I can't find it.

-Just a little.<eos> Let's see if it comes loose.<eos> It worked.<eos> -Alright.<eos> What bullshit.<eos> There's nothing to be had here. I told you.<eos> Nothing worth catching.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> Jon said to ask you how to make the coffee.<eos> He wants it black as ink. Throw in half a pack.
I'd drink my milk from a glass to please Mom.<eos> I was never the perfect son, but somehow she managed to make a man out of me.<eos> Then I'd go to the bank and make the last payment on my bike.<eos> I would only drive it this one day.<eos> It won't matter.<eos> I just don't want anybody to be left with my debts.<eos> I'd comfort Halla and tell her that Palli didn't suffer.<eos> That he just fell asleep.<eos> And I know, because I held him when he passed away.<eos> Then I'd get the old dog and have Mom take care of it.
Earth, water, wind and fire.<eos> - The mother of nature.<eos> - Step one. Step one.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Jeff, please we have no time!<eos> - Has the mut found the escape?<eos> - I hope so.<eos> - Way to go Jeff.<eos> - Ok, Step Four:<eos> If you find the exit. Use it.
Get down.<eos> Up.<eos> Are you afraid of me? No.<eos> I'm not.<eos> You should be.<eos> - I'm dying.<eos> - Don't talk, Billy.<eos> Cut his hands loose!<eos> The letter... in my pocket.<eos> Alright, kid, I got it.

A volunteer is never off duty, Collette.<eos> Neither is a mammy, Kevin.<eos> All right. No problem.<eos> - Tomorrow, then.<eos> - Aye.<eos> What the fuck's he doing here?<eos> He's grand, Connor.<eos> He was just leaving.<eos> - Just doing me job, Connor.<eos> - Fuck off and do it somewhere else.
Do we have a deal or not?<eos> You better win.<eos> Well, I'll say this much, they don't call your friend "Wreck-It" for nothing.<eos> There's the shuttle.<eos> Is he in there?<eos> Nope.<eos> Lucky for him.<eos> Otherwise I would have slapped his corpse.<eos> No Cy-Bug, either.<eos> Got to find it before it lays its filthy eggs.
Take off your baggy sack, show us, as you are.<eos> This young man has done many wrongs.<eos> Brothers, this young man is lost, his life lacks any sense.<eos> He's a thief!<eos> - What you doin'?<eos> Yes, yes-he's a thief!<eos> But, my dear friends, don't plant seeds of fear and hatred in your hearts. Don't let Satan enter your hearts.<eos> We have to love him in the same way we'd love our friend, brother or son.<eos> God guided him here, to us, cause everyone needs help!<eos> This is our mission- to teach this lost soul the path of Truth, just like anyone else who seeks it.
My one chance to save John lay inside this bottle.<eos> It was decided then, just like that. .<eos> Oh, son of a motherfuck!<eos> The fucking Soy Sauce is digging a fucking hole in my fucking face!<eos> I'll throw myself at the cop and beg him to take me to the emergency room to pump my stomach, to bring in an exorcist, to call in the Air Force to nuke this whole town into radioactive dust and bury it under 60' of concrete!<eos> And then... calm.<eos> Almost zen.<eos> That's what came next, that Soy Sauce feeling.<eos> I wanted to run, to duck, to act, but the body is a slow, wet mechanism of muscle and bone that creeped even as my mind flew.<eos> And so just like that, I stepped outside of it.
-I don't.<eos> They may have some of those black ones this time.<eos> Hey, how about some ice-cream?<eos> Chocolate flavour for me.<eos> Foryou,goal<eos> We're not going to continue your treatment...<eos> You can do anything to me.<eos> The dog was so much trouble.<eos> You did what?<eos> -I killed it.

Come on, cat, I'm gettin' all up in your grill.<eos> What are you gonna do about it?<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> You ain't nothing but a skinny, bald, scaredy-cat.<eos> Now, just wait a minute, Peter.<eos> Here's some stuff you might like.<eos> Tools of the trade.<eos> - Anything you want is yours.<eos> - Even your compass?<eos> Better a young explorer like you have it. Oh.
Is that all you've got, old man?<eos> Nope.<eos> This is.<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> - Grandpa!<eos> - Peter!<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - What happened?<eos> It says here there was a curse put on the gem to prevent any cat from misusing it again.
I want ra ç a.<eos> The mustache doctor without mustache Oncology team caught the ball.<eos> It passes AFIDA, but wait, she gave the ball!<eos> The ball was stolen by Laurens, Akkie the team.<eos> It passes Rico and kicks the ball!<eos> Oh n the ã, cool.<eos> Oncology est á with the ball.<eos> The crossing to the doctor mustache.<eos> What will he do?<eos> The teacher Ina d á a jolt it.
If he found out I took it, he'd kill me.<eos> What you doing with this?<eos> Dale.<eos> It's my fault that he died.<eos> Carl, why would you say that, man?<eos> He got bit by a walker. Why you...<eos> I saw that walker.<eos> I was gonna shoot it.<eos> It was stuck in the mud.<eos> I was throwing rocks at it and stuff.
Carl, why would you say that, man?<eos> He got bit by a walker. Why you...<eos> I saw that walker.<eos> I was gonna shoot it.<eos> It was stuck in the mud.<eos> I was throwing rocks at it and stuff.<eos> But I was gonna do it, shoot it right in the head.<eos> It got free, came after me and...<eos> I ran away.<eos> - If I had killed it, Dale would still be here.
A loss in what they do is different than losing a game.<eos> You miss a field goal, you miss a field goal.<eos> You miss doing a double backflip, you die.<eos> And they approach every obstacle like that.<eos> Those are paying fans looking to be entertained.<eos> You just can't lose.<eos> Travis's compound that he has in Maryland... is, uh, a true testament that he lives this life.<eos> It's in such a beautiful setting, you know, with these lush trees all around, and it's just<eos> - Yeah, the devil's playground, man.<eos> Death is everywhere. You can smell it in the air.
Crazy.<eos> I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Jolene... because I'm scared to death of her.<eos> Being the only girl in that whole crew, it must be very difficult.<eos> And she pulls it off like a champ.<eos> For someone who doesn't have balls, she has the biggest set.<eos> It looks fun though, Jo.<eos> You're in the hot seat, not me, but it does look fun.<eos> My main concern is aiming.<eos> I do have a word of advice.<eos> Do you wanna hear it?
I hope he gets stung by jellyfish right now. Honestly.<eos> You gotta give it to Jim though. "A", going first.<eos> "B", on a bike that weighed twice as much as my bike weighed.<eos> And "C", he didn't have all the goofy-looking hockey pads.<eos> He just frickin' pinned it.<eos> And he's a durable son of a gun, 'cause he landed flat on his face.<eos> And he's still alive.<eos> Thank you, Jim, again.<eos> I think, a lot of times, you just never expect the worst-case scenario.<eos> Ever since I've seen this stunt in an old spy movie, I've wanted a piece of it.
Everything there is to do to a car, I know how to do.<eos> Anything you don't know, I can teach you, you know?<eos> And I got a trailer down here.<eos> Stay there if you want.<eos> Yeah, see?<eos> She's shy.<eos> She can't see so good anymore.<eos> Where is it? Where's the ball?<eos> There's the trailer.<eos> She get it?

In our house? You okay with him in our house?<eos> What are you doing here, man? Shh-shh.<eos> You're making him cry.<eos> Don't shush me. You in my house, man.<eos> You need to pack all this shit up and get out the house, man.<eos> I don't know who you think you are, just coming up in our life and changing shit around, but this ain't gonna work.<eos> You gotta lower your voice, man.<eos> Lower your voice.<eos> Romina, can you step outside, please?<eos> Pack all this shit up and take it out, man.
I'm sorry, he deserved that.<eos> Now listen, you, wives have a problem with you.<eos> Just tone it down a little bit. I'm not saying get rid of it.<eos> Lord knows they're not coming here for the food all the time. All right.<eos> Just be mindful. That's all I'm saying.<eos> Got it, boss.<eos> Mission!<eos> Go empty the trash!<eos> Do to the trash what your ex-girlfriend did to you.<eos> Dump it!
How about Lancaster, New York?<eos> Baby.<eos> We're not moving.<eos> So can we talk about my name change now?<eos> Oh, brother.<eos> I spoke to the county clerk and he'll need your signature on a petition I've already filled.<eos> - You have a beautiful name.<eos> - And you changed yours.<eos> Okay, I'll make you a deal.<eos> For now you keep it, and when you turn 18, - you can change it.
Would it help if I told you I fell in love over the whole thing?<eos> You always tell us that the money can't buy you love.<eos> Well, except for in Ace's case here.<eos> Leave Janice out of this.<eos> I think you should leave Janice out of this.<eos> But then, what the hell kind of a merger would this be?<eos> Stop it, Hank.<eos> - Marissa, - Yes? Have you seen my calendar?<eos> No, I believe I saw it this morning in Mr. Mason's office.<eos> Do you want me to get it?
She's never been with a woman before but my lesbian cousin has explained to her that women make better lovers.<eos> Tell me something I don't know.<eos> And she's from money.<eos> So I want this to go really well.<eos> Just think of all the referrals I could get from that upper crust stuffy country club set of hers.<eos> So I want you to do right by her, alright?<eos> And besides, she wanted someone closer to her own age.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Now sing.<eos> I wanna feel this moment though I can't control it if it's all I ever do.
Better to serve you.<eos> Yes, this is Mistress... Miss White.<eos> Yes, yes. Do you have my ring?<eos> I must have left it at the hotel.<eos> She said you left that behind. Ah, good.<eos> No, don't worry.<eos> These things happen.<eos> Can I swing by now and just...<eos> Well, actually, it's not at the office.<eos> She said that you wanted to make another appointment same place but at 7 p.m. and that she would bring it to you then.
Can I swing by now and just...<eos> Well, actually, it's not at the office.<eos> She said that you wanted to make another appointment same place but at 7 p.m. and that she would bring it to you then.<eos> What?<eos> Are you happy with that arrangement?<eos> Mrs. White?<eos> Are you confirming?<eos> That little bitch.<eos> Do you have my ring?<eos> Well, may I have it?
What?<eos> Are you happy with that arrangement?<eos> Mrs. White?<eos> Are you confirming?<eos> That little bitch.<eos> Do you have my ring?<eos> Well, may I have it?<eos> Pretty.<eos> It is pretty damn expensive.<eos> And if you think that I didn't know you had it and you were just gonna pawn it then you must think I was born yesterday.
And if you think that I didn't know you had it and you were just gonna pawn it then you must think I was born yesterday.<eos> I'm sorry. You are simply too much.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing at all.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Will you come back here?<eos> I'm sorry. That was unforgivable.<eos> I don't know why I said that.<eos> I had to get my ring back.<eos> You have it back.
We'll make them pay.<eos> Call the personnel.<eos> Clean him and bring him to me.<eos> Sister Luce, make sure we're not short of blood.<eos> Call Francheville.<eos> I'll be in the OR.<eos> Sister, take over.<eos> Father.<eos> Do you have the text?<eos> I gave it to Your Eminence.
- No.<eos> I can walk. I'll go this way.<eos> It was easier working for you.<eos> Luce.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I have news of Jeanne, from a sister in Evreux.<eos> I can't forget about her.<eos> I pray, but I can't concentrate.<eos> I copied a text.<eos> I have read it many times. I know it by heart.
The reward for his capture is a substantial sum.<eos> Towards Spartacus yet higher.<eos> If he were to be revealed, a man such as you could continue not being himself.<eos> As I said, I have nothing of worth.<eos> A lesser sum then.<eos> Apologies.<eos> You are not Batiatus' man.<eos> You should not be outside.<eos> I wanted to see the moon.<eos> Janus loves to gaze upon it.

Within a matter of days, the symptoms had manifested as a number of neoplasms, exponentially multiplying and growing in size.<eos> These, ah, tumor-like appendages eventually covered the entire body, as we can see. Respiration became increasingly difficult.<eos> They began to affect the internal organs - crushing the heart, constricting the lungs...<eos> From first symptoms to death, the entire process took little over a week.<eos> What made this unique was that this was not an acquired disease - like a virus, but a seemingly random genetic mutation occurring in gene RIPS on chromosome twenty.<eos> All right. Let's take a closer look at some tissue samples...<eos> May I sit here?<eos> People don't want to know the way things happen.<eos> This fish, for example - no one wants to think of it suffocating in agony.<eos> We just want to fry it, eat it, forget.
Can I help you, Mr. Cutler?<eos> - Come on in here for a second.<eos> - I'm in the middle of training--<eos> Yeah, yeah, he'll find his way back.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> You know what I did last night?<eos> On the absolute insistence of Debra, and God knows I tried to blow her off. I read your novel last night.<eos> You did?<eos> Have you shown this to anyone else, anyone outside the agency?<eos> No, no, you're the only one that's seen it.
Let's say no to this kind of communism.<eos> Tell it to the workers.<eos> We don't do fluff here at "Rouge".<eos> The solutions come from below.<eos> We still have the power to denounce!<eos> Workers know it. Let's get their voces heard.<eos> I corrected my article like you said.<eos> So?<eos> You're right. It's better.<eos> I'll send it on. They should publish it.
I'm here all day. I'm saving up to move closer by.<eos> I didn't go back to Italy.<eos> Christine insisted but I had no reason to be there.<eos> On the way back they stopped in Auvergne.<eos> - They edited there. - And then?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> She stopped answering.<eos> See my article in "Rouge"? I don't read "Rouge".<eos> Not every week.<eos> I have it for you.
Nothing.<eos> Comrades risked their lives to film it and smuggle it out.<eos> So people know how desperate the situation is. It's exceptional.<eos> I didn't say I don't agree.<eos> I totally do.<eos> You live with Jean-René?<eos> A house in Kremlin-Bicêtre. With members of the collective.<eos> The film you made in Italy... Is it finished?<eos> We're still debating.<eos> Comrades find it politically questionable.
We can't.<eos> I can.<eos> But the door looking out the street are on the other side.<eos> Where is your cane?<eos> Pardon me?<eos> Where is your cane?<eos> I don't own one.<eos> So you can't join me.<eos> Where is this cane?<eos> I broke it down.
Where is your cane?<eos> Pardon me?<eos> Where is your cane?<eos> I don't own one.<eos> So you can't join me.<eos> Where is this cane?<eos> I broke it down.<eos> How come?<eos> When I was walking around with a cane everybody was staring at me... They offered help they pushed and pulled me.<eos> So you broke it down on purpose?
Should I take them out?<eos> No!<eos> Take them!<eos> I don't want them!<eos> Play with them!<eos> And, what are you doing now?<eos> I'm clicking.<eos> What?<eos> And where is your cane?<eos> I don't have it.
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.<eos> And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire.<eos> And there, Broomhilda shall remain.<eos> Unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.<eos> Does a fella arise?<eos> Yes, Django, as a matter of fact, he does.<eos> A fella named Siegfried.<eos> Does Siegfried save her?<eos> Quite spectacularly so.<eos> He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it.
- His son's with him.<eos> - Well, good.<eos> He'll have a loved one with him.<eos> Maybe even share a last word.<eos> That's better than most of them get.<eos> Damn sight better than he deserves.<eos> Put down the rifle.<eos> Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.<eos> Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.<eos> Read it aloud.
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.<eos> Now, all four of them gentlemen, they back there at Candyland laughing their ass off. You know why?<eos> 'Cause they just got away with murder.<eos> But it ain't got to be that way.<eos> You and your mates, y'all can ride back there and y'all can go get that money.<eos> What'd these jokers do again?<eos> These sons of bitches, they killed innocent people.<eos> Stagecoach robbery.<eos> Innocent white people.<eos> I got the handbill right here in my pocket, if you let me get it.

When you drive a car, you must look when you're reversing the damn car.<eos> - Are you drunk? - No.<eos> I did not see you.<eos> - I ride in a giant car. - I have to catch a plane.<eos> We all have to catch a damn plane... and now I won't catch mine, and please stop stop crying.<eos> It's just because I've been really unlucky here in the past.<eos> And I am not accustomed to travelling alone.<eos> There, there.<eos> Give me your driver's license, and we can sort it here.<eos> - I can't find it.
Ida?<eos> Ida, dammit!<eos> Ida.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I came to find you.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I want to ask you a favor.<eos> I have received a letter from the hospital.<eos> I don't know what it says.<eos> I dare not open it alone.

A lot of people died.<eos> Trouble was... they didn't stay dead.<eos> The computer that controlled the Hive was a state of the art artificial intelligence, the Red Queen.<eos> The Red Queen responded to the threat of the viral outbreak in an extreme way.<eos> She went homicidal.<eos> You're all going to die down here.<eos> The Red Queen attempted to kill everyone whether they were infected or not.<eos> I managed to escape, but... this was only the beginning.<eos> Viral outbreak spread like wildfire. First across the United States... then the world.<eos> But the T virus didn't just bring the dead back to life. It mutated them in terrifying ways.
Does it start from the top?<eos> "Top Gun" from the top.<eos> - Sit back and enjoy the ride.<eos> - Tom Cruise, I guess. - Mmmmm.<eos> - Ah. - Great.<eos> - I like that movie.<eos> - It's a good movie.<eos> - Terrific. - Wonderful.<eos> Artistic.<eos> Do you want to watch it again?

- Taquito.<eos> - I'm sorry, guys.<eos> I just don't want anything to change.<eos> Taquito, change is important.<eos> But that doesn't mean we're gonna forget about our old friends.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Hold on a second, Taquito.<eos> Taquito, we just had a Dobis meeting, and we've decided to let you run the mall fountain.<eos> Really?<eos> Not only do you have to get it working, but you have to maintain it and keep track of all the loose change.
Laugh.<eos> We fought for a laugh track, and they said, "No, this is a feature film for the theaters.<eos> A laugh track wouldn't make any sense."<eos> Think about it.<eos> Eric, she was making you soft.<eos> She's taken your eyes off the game, Eric, okay?<eos> We're here for Dobis.<eos> What did you give me? That wasn't Spanish fly.<eos> I played the oldest trick in the book.<eos> But I had to play it 'cause I needed to save my friend.
- Why are you blushing?<eos> Probably because you want to try it.<eos> Look, I always had a little yen for sleeping with a woman, and when I finally did it, it was...<eos> It was very intense. It was very exciting, but unnerving.<eos> - I really have no repressed...<eos> - I shot this TV movie once, and one of the scenes was with this incredible lingerie model.<eos> I mean, she was to die.<eos> And for whatever reason, I get this message one day from the assistant director that Miss Lee would like me to go to her dressing room.<eos> And why she was so suddenly obsessed with me, I don't...<eos> And I go. And she's in a robe, and she takes it off, and gives me a big hug and kiss,
Lasers? Those are real lasers?<eos> The mission's been compromised. Hey.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Let's get out of here!<eos> Drive!<eos> Floor it!<eos> Sorry.<eos> What do we do with the van?<eos> Leave it.<eos> I stole it from the lot.
She was really pretty.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> She died.<eos> Some jerk, some a-hole jerk in a band got drunk<eos> and crashed his car into her living room.<eos> I should have been there, you know.<eos> People tell you that there are other girls out there, you know, and it's not just about a girl, it's about<eos> It's about a time and a place.<eos> Do you have a favorite song?<eos> Would you tell me what it is?
no way. you got detention?<eos> now when your mom accuses me of being a bad influence, she actually has a leg to stand on.<eos> uh, yeah.<eos> can the ashman interest you in his other wears?<eos> grade a. called blue sky.<eos> and trust me, it will get you soaring.<eos> yeah.<eos> no. no go, dude.<eos> this body's a temple.<eos> there's no way i'm polluting it with that shit.
Where the hell were you? - Come on...<eos> To get gas?<eos> From a whore?<eos> Where the fuck were you?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want to know where you were. I've been waiting for you.<eos> A body washed up ashore.<eos> It floated like it was dead.<eos> Lifeless.<eos> The Sheriff brought it in on a mule.
A second autopsy was performed yesterday... Wha...?<eos> "There is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow."<eos> This sentence was added.<eos> N-no way!<eos> Ergo, It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya."<eos> Your Honor!<eos> I did not hear of this report!<eos> Silence!<eos> Unfortunately, this report is an official record.<eos> The court will accept it as evidence.
What do you mean?<eos> As this photo points out, there is the possibility that the actual time of the crime was 23:30.<eos> Then,<eos> Mr. Wright... who is this man... that was on the boat with Miles Edgeworth?<eos> [i] Of course... [/i] It is someone who disguised himself as Attorney Hammond.<eos> The real murderer.<eos> There is one person I suspect... as the real criminal of this case.<eos> But... I don't know his name.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Because... he never said it.
Gimme that bottle!<eos> How about if Djole fucks you a little.<eos> - He will fuck her, bro!<eos> - Who else would?<eos> Let's do it today, bro!<eos> - C'mon Sanja.<eos> - Ok, ok.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What will we do with gin?<eos> I don't wanna throw it away.
- You kidnapped Paul?<eos> - Correct.<eos> Why?<eos> I just told you why.<eos> No.<eos> Why me?<eos> Completely random choice.<eos> That's awful.<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> Can I have my dog back now, please, so I can love it a bit more?
No, Cami, sit down!<eos> I see you're going below 10,000.<eos> - How are you doing?<eos> - Not good.<eos> Not good.<eos> Margaret, there's a red lever right there next to my seat.<eos> It says "manual control." You see it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> On the count of three, I want you to pull it up, turn it clockwise, push it back down.
You're a stupid fucker if you don't believe in God.<eos> Once you realize all the random events in your life are God, you will live a much easier life.<eos> We spend all our time trying to control all these things that happen to us, it's bullshit.<eos> The plane you're flying goes down?<eos> Out of your control.<eos> God gives you cancer?<eos> I got no control over that.<eos> Did God give me cancer?<eos> You bet your ass God gave me cancer.<eos> You know, do you think God would have given me cancer if I'd asked for it?
What's making you feel so powerless?<eos> I'm way too afraid to even approach a woman... that might be on my intellectual level.<eos> I know what you're gonna say.<eos> It's not 'cause I'm afraid she'll reject me.<eos> I'm afraid I'll reject her. Okay.<eos> Why is that?<eos> You know, a lot of smart women think too much to look good... and talk too much to fuck well.<eos> I feel like such an asshole saying these things to a woman.<eos> I do get what you're saying, actually.<eos> 'Cause the movie comes out this week. Everyone's acting like I'm supposed to be excited, but I fucking hate it. And I wish I could say it looks nothing like the script I handed them, but they didn't change a goddamn line.
So cute!<eos> Gross, Steve.<eos> Those things eat their own shit.<eos> What are you talking about? Germans?<eos> Tina's rodent.<eos> Sarah, would you like to hold him?<eos> - No.<eos> I would.<eos> Gimme this little shit eater.<eos> - Get it away!
Becky can't wear that dress!<eos> Becky can't wear that dress.<eos> What? Okay, listen to me.<eos> This is clearly like some girl shit that I don't understand, so may I just be very, very diplomatic and say let it fucking go?<eos> No!<eos> I'm not gonna watch Becky Archer walk down the aisle in my dream dress.<eos> I'd rather lick this sidewalk.<eos> Great!<eos> Lick the sidewalk, then, please.<eos> I'm gonna lick it, too.
I mean, I wanted to see the stripper go the full thing.<eos> Yeah. It would've been great to see one more dick before, before I see Dale's for the rest of my life, but... you've just done so much work for this wedding, just put your own shit<eos> aside in order to do everything.<eos> I have to pee.<eos> Oh, '94 talent show.<eos> Your leotards are phenomenal. I won that shit every single year, right?<eos> Yeah, but '94 was special.<eos> That was the year you got a bra.<eos> Which you stole.<eos> I could find it if I looked for it.
You said that when you find the right girl...<eos> Did you go out last night? When you, when you got it uh, good, you don't do anything to screw it up.<eos> But for some people, um, and I'm one of them, I think you have to screw it up uh, before you realize that you've got it good.<eos> I-I I'm just excited because Gena and I, we had sex last night.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> We did, but like who cares, right?<eos> Can I say that?<eos> But the thing is, is when we're having sex, it's fine,<eos> I put my penis uh, into um, Gena's vagina...<eos> And then I took it out. And then I, I put it in again.
- OK.<eos> I was thinking, maybe we should go away together some time.<eos> I don't know, for a weekend or something.<eos> - On holiday?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> See you later.<eos> What?<eos> - Where's the gear?<eos> - What? - Where's the gear?<eos> - What? I gave it to you!
They said it was frivolous.<eos> Bastards wouldn't even pay for the funeral.<eos> That must have made you pretty angry.<eos> You got no idea.<eos> Angry enough to kill Clark Weilman?<eos> Look at me, mister.<eos> You really think I got it in me to cave some guy's head in?<eos> Drop you back at campus.<eos> What about the case?<eos> You helped us solve it.
Impressive theory.<eos> But wrong.<eos> Pamela Weilman isn't a killer.<eos> She's a victim.<eos> First, her husband cheats on her, and then this neanderthal cop tries to put her in jail... which is typical of how the mentally ill are treated by our so-called justice system.<eos> Well, I'm stuck.<eos> And the only thing that I know of that's going to get me unstuck is burger grease.<eos> You know cholesterol is the silent killer?<eos> You'll have a garden burger.<eos> I'll buy it for you.
I'll go with you, I'll go with you.<eos> - Well done.<eos> What's your name, son?<eos> - I'm Robbie from Carntyne.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Harry from Manchester.<eos> Okay. One whisky.<eos> I'll come round in front of you.<eos> And I want you to try and describe it.
Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Harry from Manchester.<eos> Okay. One whisky.<eos> I'll come round in front of you.<eos> And I want you to try and describe it.<eos> And possibly to guess which one it is.<eos> Um... The colour tells you that it's probably got a bit of... It's probably a mix of casks, both of American oak and European oak.<eos> A sweet nose.<eos> Come on, describe it to me.
- Now they've gotta let us on.<eos> Stop the bus!<eos> They're stopping.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> Fuck me. Sound Of Music.<eos> Sorry, Sisters, you cannae control these Protestants, you know.<eos> Lovely. Thank you.<eos> Are you from Highlands?<eos> Actually, my great, great grandfather, he was a Highland chief.<eos> This kilt is the tartan and I wear it with pride every time I put it on.

One to keep, one to swap and one to drink with my mates.<eos> You didn't do a deal with Dobie?<eos> Hasn't got the nerve.<eos> You little bastard. I'll be damned.<eos> - How much do you want?<eos> - 200,000.<eos> With no provenance? Not a chance.<eos> "Not a stickler for detail", that's what I heard.<eos> And that's not all. I want a job. I want a real job.<eos> - Can you get it to Glasgow?
- Perhaps I've already asked... - Yes, you have.<eos> I haven't seen her.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I've asked so many people.<eos> Good morning.<eos> How much for the cape?<eos> Three hundred reis.<eos> - Has it got gold stitching?<eos> - I don't haggle. I'm no gypsy.<eos> Take it or leave it.
You know what?<eos> Pull over.<eos> - What? - Pull the fuck over.<eos> You know, I know you're trying to do the best for me, but I can't stand around and watch a bunch of assholes do nothing<eos> - about my best friend being killed. Frank, you're getting in over your head here, all right?<eos> You're to the point now where even I can't help you.<eos> I don't want your help.<eos> - You've got something of ours!<eos> What? ! The flash drive, asshole.<eos> Your boy took it from us.
Do you think I would have let you sodomize me if I didn't think there was a future here?<eos> You did say that you liked it more than you thought you would.<eos> - Well that's not the point.<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> This man's a monster.<eos> He likes to fuck women in the ass and then tell them that he just wants to keep it casual.<eos> Who calling' my phone?<eos> It's yo agent.<eos> Calling from the coast with the prospect of a significant payday.<eos> - I'll take it.
Can I go use the bathroom?<eos> I think you'd better wait around here for a while.<eos> Maybe do it in a pan or something.<eos> I can wait.<eos> I don't use no pans.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> What's your dog's name?<eos> Bonny.<eos> That's a nice name.<eos> I'm sure Mr. Kieslowski will take good care of your dog and get it back to you safe.
I didn't mean AIDS or nothing, honey.<eos> Honey, I meant like chlamydia or something.<eos> Three weeks I haven't seen you, and that's the way you talk to me?<eos> I've been busy, baby.<eos> I've been busy trying to help you out, if you must know.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, you know you said your asshole boyfriend loves his dog more than anything in the world, right?<eos> - You haven't?<eos> - I have!<eos> Billy! Billy, you've gotta give it back.
Give it back? I ain't gonna give back shit, let alone my shih tzu.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - "Give it back." It's kidnapped.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> It's a kidnapped dog. You don't just give back a kidnapped dog.<eos> Defeats the entire object of the kidnapping.<eos> They didn't just give Patty Hearst back, did they?<eos> No, this dog is my Patty Hearst. Except I ain't gonna keep it in a closet and make it rob a bank.<eos> No, I'm gonna hold on to it until your asshole boyfriend starts behaving like a decent human being and gives me a bunch of money.
No, look, I built one for a guy in Michigan.<eos> You just poke a hole in the ice.<eos> It's no problem.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Trust me.<eos> You're gonna love it, Dad.<eos> God.<eos> Yeah, can I get someone to remove this television from my room, please?<eos> No, it's not broken.<eos> I just don't want it here.
I unplugged it already.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Where did we leave off?<eos> Are they taking the TV out of your room?<eos> What?<eos> What are you, Amish?<eos> Yes, and I was hoping to escort you to a barn raising upon my return.<eos> Oh, my God, seriously, why are they taking the TV out of your room?<eos> I just can't have it in my room.
We've heard he's on the fifth floor.<eos> Baby.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine, Ma.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm...<eos> Are you in pain?<eos> No.<eos> They got me on the good stuff.<eos> I didn't even have to steal it.
You know why?<eos> Why?<eos> You know where I was thinking we might want this guy?<eos> We can put him in our moat.<eos> In our moat, that was what I was thinking.<eos> Perfect. You guys have a moat?<eos> Of course.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's that? Look at that.<eos> Do you want to pick it up?
Get out of this place. Get our own house.<eos> Make a million bucks and never work again.<eos> It came to us for a reason.<eos> John?<eos> John?<eos> No.<eos> No, John! No!<eos> Are you a gift from the gods?<eos> So, John, how did you come upon this teapot?<eos> I just found it at a garage sale.
Baby, no!<eos> Oh, baby, no.<eos> Oh, baby!<eos> Hey!<eos> - Where is the teapot?<eos> - Teapot?<eos> - The one you had on the television.<eos> It's a precious family heirloom.<eos> Our grandmother risked her life to save that teapot during the holocaust.<eos> -I bought it from the old lady.
- The one you had on the television.<eos> It's a precious family heirloom.<eos> Our grandmother risked her life to save that teapot during the holocaust.<eos> -I bought it from the old lady.<eos> She gave me a really good deal. -Impossible.<eos> It was the last thing she talked about before she passed.<eos> She said her teapot was missing.<eos> She died?<eos> Where is it?<eos> We sold it!
We should probably listen to what he has to say.<eos> Interest in teapots?<eos> Seriously?<eos> If he takes it, the party will end.<eos> Hi.<eos> Dr. Ling, I wish you would have called us sooner.<eos> We donated the teapot to a museum.<eos> Tax write-off.<eos> - We must talk.<eos> - We don't have it.
Back off.<eos> Tiny underwear.<eos> Did you shave the top of your thighs?<eos> Alice, get back inside.<eos> Would it have made any difference if we'd warned you?<eos> You knew we had the teapot the whole time?<eos> You were creating our rightful inheritance.<eos> So we'll just take the cash, and you can keep that beast.<eos> You don't even want the teapot?<eos> If you're smart, you'll get rid of it before it's too late.
I should have done something more, but I don't know-- I don't know what else I could have done.<eos> My father, his father, His father for two centuries took oath... To find a teapot and hide away forever.<eos> I have opportunity they wait lifetime for.<eos> I found teapot in hands of average people, good people.<eos> Where is Alice, John?<eos> She will want more.<eos> Soon not just the bad people, but those weakest.<eos> Why wouldn't you just break into our house and take the teapot?<eos> It must be given, not taken.<eos> That is the only way to rob it of power.

You're giving up on us?<eos> I will never give up on the teapot.<eos> I will wait and wait... Until the teapot destroy you,<eos> And then I will follow it to the next owner...<eos> And the next.<eos> I will knock on their door and tell them what I told you.<eos> Maybe they will listen.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Just promise me that you'll end it.<eos> Give it to Ling, And he'll get rid of it.
Yeah?<eos> Arnie took the teapot.<eos> Let's just give it all away--<eos> The car, the house. Everything.<eos> I don't want it anymore.<eos> I miss our pinto.<eos> Wait. Did we just give sauron his ring back?<eos> You're such a geek.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> We have to deliver it to Ling ourselves.
- No.<eos> - Sweet dreams.<eos> Guys, you don't wanna-- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Oh, my god! Wizards!<eos> Give us the teapot!<eos> I'm sorry. Who the hell are you?<eos> I am god's holy representative.<eos> Our grandmother stole the teapot from hitler,<eos> And these sinners stole it from her.
We should leave the mothers out of this.<eos> Are you cops or not? I am not.<eos> I was thrown out.<eos> - And my working hours are shortened. Wait.<eos> I know that the money came from the Employers union.<eos> Chaligny's wife picked up the cash to finance the gambling. And because of Cardinet and Mrs. Chaligny, I do not need to explain...<eos> Where's the money?<eos> You've kept it, for safety?<eos> When I dropped her off that night, I was left alone with the briefcase.<eos> I could not leave it there.
Kind of.<eos> Uh, it's weird I'm even saying that.<eos> Jeez, that Charlie gets around.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, I'm just gonna take this, actually.<eos> Nate?<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Didn't your phone die?<eos> I charged it.
Ah.<eos> Bien sur.<eos> Merci.<eos> Nous parlerons demain.<eos> So for those of us who took Italian, what was that all about?<eos> That was Cyrus and another attorney at his firm.<eos> They think they may have found a loophole in my prenup.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yes.<eos> Apparently, since we signed it in Monaco but got married in the U.S.-- You can contest it.
And there's nothing you can do that will make me change my mind.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> Do you realize how many people will get hurt if this gets out?<eos> You need to go.<eos> You've already complicated things enough by being here.<eos> This whole thing was supposed to go off without a hitch.<eos> You better hope it still does.<eos> My computer's gone.<eos> Gossip Girl.<eos> She took it. What?
You better hope it still does.<eos> My computer's gone.<eos> Gossip Girl.<eos> She took it. What?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because we set you up.<eos> After we got the address for tonight, I gave it to Gossip Girl.<eos> And I made sure you followed her cell phone all the way here.<eos> You changed the password on her site, so she needed the actual laptop.<eos> I'm just sorry for Nate that she grabbed it before you could send that post about Diana.
As long as you stay here and think about it with me.<eos> Miss Serena.<eos> You scare me half to death.<eos> Oh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Why you eat berries in dark?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I just forgot to eat dinner tonight.<eos> Where is your computer?<eos> I-I go get it.

- The car is going to backfire.<eos> - There's going to be a loud noise.<eos> - So what?<eos> - Oh, noises are important.<eos> Noises can tell you everything. For instance...<eos> Thank you.<eos> On hearing a smoke alarm, a mother would look towards her child.<eos> Amazing how fire exposes our priorities.<eos> I really hope you don't have a baby in here.<eos> All right, John, you can turn it off now.

Not just explosives.<eos> Break into that place and if you're lucky, you just get blown up, so they say.<eos> In case you're planning a wee stroll. Ta.<eos> I'll remember.<eos> Aye. No, it buggers up tourism a bit, so thank God for the demon hound.<eos> Did you see that show?<eos> The documentary?<eos> Quite recently, yeah.<eos> God bless Henry Knight and his monster from hell.<eos> Ever seen it? The hound?
Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> All right?<eos> Right, take care.<eos> Bye.<eos> Mind if I join you?<eos> It's not true, is it, you haven't actually seen this hound thing?<eos> Are you from the papers?<eos> No, nothing like that, just curious.<eos> Have you seen it?
What? Bet?<eos> My plan needs darkness.<eos> We've got another half an hour of light.<eos> Wait, wait, what bet?<eos> I bet John here 50 quid that you couldn't prove you'd seen the hound.<eos> Yeah, the guys in the pub said you could.<eos> Well, you're going to lose your money, mate.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I seen it.
And dogs, dogs the size of horses.<eos> We did say 50.<eos> Ta.<eos> Pass, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You've got ID for Baskerville? !<eos> How?<eos> It's not specific to this place.<eos> It's my brother's. Access all areas.<eos> I, um, ahem, acquired it ages ago. Just in case.
I guess it's Morse.<eos> It doesn't seem to make much sense.<eos> U, M, Q, R, A, does that mean anything?<eos> So, OK, what have we got?<eos> We know there's footprints, because Henry found them, and so did the tour guide bloke.<eos> We all heard something.<eos> Maybe we should just look for whoever's got a big dog.<eos> Henry's right.<eos> What?<eos> I saw it, too.

Right.<eos> Which means you'll have to start the search for the hound.<eos> In the labs.<eos> Stapleton's first.<eos> It could be dangerous.<eos> You know I'd love to I'd love to give you unlimited access to this place. Why not?<eos> It's a simple enough request, Major.<eos> I've never heard of anything so bizarre.<eos> You're to give me 24 hours, it's what I negotiated, not a second more.<eos> I may have to comply with this order, but I don't have to like it.
Nothing there!<eos> It doesn't make any sense!<eos> What were you expecting to find?<eos> A drug, of course.<eos> It has to be a drug.<eos> An hallucinogenic or a deliriant of some kind.<eos> There's no trace of anything in the sugar.<eos> Sugar? Sugar, yes.<eos> A simple process of elimination.<eos> I saw the hound, saw it as my imagination expected me to see it.

Sugar, yes.<eos> A simple process of elimination.<eos> I saw the hound, saw it as my imagination expected me to see it.<eos> A genetically engineered monster.<eos> I knew I couldn't believe my eyes, so there were seven possible reasons, the most possible being narcotics.<eos> Henry Knight, he saw it too, but you didn't, John. You didn't see it.
Moriarty's not mounting any defence.<eos> Bank of England, Tower of London, Pentonville.<eos> Three of the most secure places in the country and six weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in, no one knows how or why.<eos> - All we know is...<eos> - He ended up in custody.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> - Do what?<eos> - The look.<eos> - Look? - You're doing the look again.<eos> Well, I can't see it, can I?
Dr. Grant, I am so sorry.<eos> I'm really embarrassed about that.<eos> Surgeons don't have the luxury about being sorry about anything, Mary.<eos> I have enough useless twats in my class. I'm not gonna abide by one of my<eos> - promising students falling asleep.<eos> - I am so sorry.<eos> - I was up all night studying. - Uh-huh.<eos> That's what they all say.<eos> - I was suturing a turkey. - Uh-huh.<eos> Did you eat it afterwards?
You used to be a happy kid<eos> I used to be.<eos> All thanks to him<eos> All he ever wanted was to forget everything<eos> And move on with you<eos> Of course, it didn't work out<eos> You know, Ann, it was a long time ago<eos> You really should just let it go<eos> When you get old enough, you don't fear death anymore<eos> You wait for it.

So who do I talk to at county?<eos> No one's there? It's only 8:00.<eos> Are you county boys doing down there?<eos> You having a party?<eos> There's got to be someone in evidence.<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> Yeah, yeah-- No, tomorrow's too late!<eos> The mayor must have put Gil up to this.<eos> We have to get that key.<eos> And how are we gonna get it?
La Fontaine, a great master at reconciling form and content.<eos> You'll learn to write, develop your ideas, express yourselves, tell stories.<eos> Don't forget the adjective assignment for Monday.<eos> Try to read a little! Spend some time with books.<eos> Forget your phones.<eos> I'm counting on you. Read books.<eos> Be curious.<eos> You wanted to see me, sir?<eos> Yes. The paper about your weekend...<eos> Did you write it?

This is not my fault!<eos> Of course.<eos> Let's drill into your brain, shall we?<eos> This day sucks.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe operating in your current state of mind is a bad idea.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> What are those?<eos> The haptic telepresence gloves are like a steering wheel for the nanoprobe she's about to insert.<eos> I'm gonna drive the probe through your brain to the axonal cluster and neutralize it.
- Too late. Now go.<eos> That's enough, just go.<eos> Papa, Papa!<eos> Today I built a pretty house. Do you want to see?<eos> Is it time to go home already?<eos> - No, not yet.<eos> I just wanted to tell you a secret.<eos> Can I borrow your fish?<eos> Papa is going to take your fish, but you mustn't tell anyone.<eos> And when I bring it back, it will be much bigger.
In Waterloo.<eos> We have nothing to fear.<eos> The Austrians will bring order to Europe.<eos> - And Fabrice?<eos> - He is dead to me.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> What if he is truly dead?<eos> His death would certainly be best for the family.<eos> I no longer want to hear his name. Never again.<eos> Forget it.
- Marquis Crescenzi.<eos> - A small man, but the wealthiest in Parma.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> You are more beautiful than what they say, Miss Conti.<eos> You are more of a gentleman than I thought, Marquis.<eos> Clelia.<eos> May I enjoy a dance with you?<eos> Of course, Fabrice.<eos> You remember my name.<eos> The other day, you asked me not to forget it.
We thank you both.<eos> Yet one but flatters us,<eos> As well appeareth by the cause you come, Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.<eos> Cousin of Hereford, What dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?<eos> First - heaven be the record to my speech! In the devotion of a subject's love,<eos> And free from other misbegotten hate, Come I appellant to this princely presence.<eos> My body shall make good upon this earth, Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.<eos> Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,<eos> Too good to be so, and too bad to live,<eos> Since the more fair and crystal is the sky, The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
Turn left at the petrified forest<eos> There you'll find Wu-Liang Mountain<eos> Master Chen is in retreat on that mountain<eos> Here I come!<eos> Coffee Beans from Java<eos> It's boiling!<eos> It's boiling!<eos> This is called coffee<eos> Coffee is ground from coffee beans<eos> Zi Jing brought it back from Great Britain
It's boiling!<eos> It's boiling!<eos> This is called coffee<eos> Coffee is ground from coffee beans<eos> Zi Jing brought it back from Great Britain<eos> It tastes even better than tea!<eos> Yuck it's more bitter than Chinese medicine!<eos> You don't know what you're talking about<eos> The more bitter it is the better the quality<eos> This is how you drink it!
Join in.<eos> - You can sing! - Dude!<eos> - How high does your belt go?<eos> - My what?<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - You have to audition for the Bellas.<eos> I can't concentrate on anything you're saying until you cover your junk.<eos> Just consider it.<eos> One time, we sang backup for Prince.<eos> His butt is so tiny that I can hold it with, like, one hand.
- You know David Guetta?<eos> - Have I been living under a rock?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That song is my jam.<eos> My lady-jam.<eos> That's nice.<eos> It is.<eos> That song really builds.<eos> - Gross.<eos> - Can you sing it for me?
There's a lion!<eos> No, wait, Isabelle, don't.<eos> Never run from a predatory cat.<eos> I'm going to die! -Isabelle, listen to me.<eos> We must look it in the eye and show it we're not afraid.<eos> I've seen this in a BBC documentary.<eos> BBC is a reliable source.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> I don't want to die!<eos> We must tame it.
I act like a complete bitch and he just looks at me with his big puppy eyes.<eos> It's upsetting me. I can assure you that.<eos> He'll never sign the divorce papers.<eos> Never.<eos> What's he doing now?<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> This tee is a specialty in the Caucasus.<eos> It's very good.<eos> Would you like sugar?<eos> Normally, it's drunk without it.
Down here.<eos> Stairwell and up.<eos> - Great, further from the exit.<eos> My unit's up on level four.<eos> We'll be safer up there.<eos> Shit.<eos> Where's the key?<eos> - The key. The key's gone.<eos> Shit.<eos> - Find it.
Hey, wasn't that bad.<eos> She annihilated me.<eos> It wasn't a fair fight, though.<eos> - She was a track star.<eos> - You ran track?<eos> Distance runner. 1600.<eos> Broke some kind of state record.<eos> No shit.<eos> What record did you break?<eos> I didn't break it.
Going to a college campus.<eos> Girls your age.<eos> - Like Angie?<eos> - Yes, like Angie.<eos> I - I don't know.<eos> Maybe this is too much too soon.<eos> We'll go back home.<eos> We could watch the movie of your first time.<eos> You made a movie of me and Angie?<eos> Yes, I did. I haven't watched it yet.
And what did you say?<eos> - I said that I exercise.<eos> And do you think?<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> I was a great player.<eos> I'm doing great when the balloon.<eos> - Welcome!<eos> - My arm ...<eos> - Good catch, Casper!<eos> - I got it!
- Do not you think, Dazzle.<eos> - Let me go!<eos> - Do not do it!<eos> Dazzle, what are you doing?<eos> My adventure with the skull ... This does not work well.<eos> Zemoni everywhere.<eos> The skull was not there, So how should.<eos> Then, some zemoni playing football using the skull as a ball.<eos> Zemonul QB I see and threw the skull.<eos> Got it and I started running.
What happened to you, Juan?<eos> You were such a lovely child.<eos> A drink,if you please, Little Brother.<eos> Water,of course, Holy Father?<eos> No,no,no,wine.<eos> We would have wine.<eos> Take care; we would not have you spill the wine.<eos> It comes from our vineyards in Spain,Valencia.<eos> Too precious to spill.<eos> Taste it; you will see.
I am stuck in a filler year.<eos> - You're not stuck, Caroline. - Yeah, I am.<eos> But it's okay.<eos> You know, it's all good.<eos> I will be fine.<eos> But I just need some time to wallow in it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I think I have another idea.<eos> What do you want me to do with her head?<eos> Just get rid of it, burn it.
And continue the Petrova bloodline.<eos> Every few hundred years, you'll have a new doppelgänger and never run out of hybrids, right?<eos> Consider it a small return on my investment in her well-being.<eos> See, after you hand me back the coffin, I'll ensure her safety for the rest of her natural life. You know it's what's best for her.<eos> So what do you say, Stefan?<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> [BOTH YELLING]<eos> Bring me my coffin before I burn him alive.<eos> I'll get it. KLAUS:
There's gotta be another way.<eos> Well, what if I told you I had a less diabolical plan?<eos> - You wanna dagger Elijah.<eos> - They're all linked.<eos> One goes down, they all go down.<eos> The witches live.<eos> Elena's safe. Problem solved.<eos> - Don't know how that will affect Klaus.<eos> - Klaus isn't our current problem.<eos> The dagger's lethal to any vampire who uses it.
Isn't she stunning?<eos> She certainly looks good walking away from you.<eos> I'll take that as a challenge.<eos> [HORN HONKS]<eos> - Caroline.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> Take a hint.<eos> Don't be angry, love.<eos> We had a little spat.<eos> - I'm over it already.
Hey, there.<eos> Hi. Where's Meredith?<eos> She got called, uh, in to the hospital for a last-minute surgery. But she'll be back later.<eos> What happened?<eos> Oh, I broke a coffee cup and sliced my hand open trying to pick up the pieces.<eos> But, uh, I'll live.<eos> Did Stefan catch up with you?<eos> No.<eos> Did you get my ring?<eos> I couldn't find it.

I guess I'll, uh, just have to go get it.
Just sayin'. Listen, of all the people, you cannot psychoanalyze me.<eos> I killed Caroline's father. I nearly killed Meredith.<eos> Everything has changed.<eos> You're not turning yourself in.<eos> Bonnie's herbs are working and we have originals to kill.<eos> His morals get very questionable when he has revenge on the brain.<eos> Klaus needs to die, we finally have a chance to kill him.<eos> So you are not turning yourself in.<eos> Here's your ring, Ric.<eos> Put it on.

How?<eos> Act interested.<eos> She's lonely.<eos> Desperate.<eos> Clearly.<eos> She slept with you.<eos> Beefcake holds bombshell, I come up from behind her, grab her arms like this...<eos> Which gives me time for one shot.<eos> Got it? Good.<eos> So we all have one stake, we keep it hidden and we look out for any opportunity we have.
- Damon.<eos> He thinks he's hilarious.<eos> - At least one of us has a sense of humor.<eos> Are you sure you're...?<eos> I mean, you don't have to be kept in here.<eos> Uh, no, this is... Ah. This is the right place for me to be.<eos> At least until you guys can convince my highly-uncooperative alter ego to fess up to where I... Or he hid the white oak stake.<eos> We looked everywhere.<eos> You...<eos> The other you hid it well, heh.

Picture?<eos> From what? Our trip to Disneyland?<eos> Come on, Rose. You're not gonna actually make us wait, are you?<eos> I know you're obsessed with me.<eos> Ugh.<eos> All right, uh, tell me something about her.<eos> Um, well, she did this little thing with her tongue.<eos> Something that matters, Damon.<eos> She spent her last day in paradise. Soaking in the sun and reminiscing about what it means to be human.<eos> And when death came she didn't fear it.
Now, by my count there should be one more.<eos> - It's gonna take more time.<eos> Because you're waiting for that one to pass out?<eos> No thanks.<eos> I'll just kill him.<eos> Then you won't know the location of the other stake.<eos> - I can live with that.<eos> - Well, I can't.<eos> When we staked Finn, we discovered that killing an Original vampire killed its entire bloodline.<eos> Now, I don't know which one of you I'm descended from but I'd really rather not find out by dying. So why don't we find the stake, destroy it so we can all be safe?
I keep blacking out, which means I'm still a threat to everyone.<eos> I don't know if right now is the best time for you to be going on a spirit quest, Ric.<eos> Ah, it's just for a couple days.<eos> I'm stocked up on Bonnie's herb, so I should be fine.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Quite the cunning liar.<eos> Well, Damon's too arrogant to think his only friend would betray him.<eos> Just as Niklaus would blindly accept an invitation from his beloved sister, unaware that he is headed to his own death.<eos> Did you give him the stake?<eos> He burned it without hesitation.

I don't want to know.<eos> How can you be so fair about this?<eos> Because after everything I've put you through... I'm just honored to be your date tonight.<eos> We three need to talk.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Uh Hey.<eos> Why are you still wearing your ring?<eos> Didn't Elena tell you?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know all about Alaric.<eos> My sister stops hanging out with vampires, I'll take it off.
Just you.<eos> Maybe a curling iron.<eos> - I have to tell Bonnie...<eos> - I'll call Bonnie, okay?<eos> - Two hours. Don't you dare be late. - Okay.<eos> I'm not halfway out of Virginia and Elena sells our souls to the Originals?<eos> - It was her call.<eos> - You know what else was her call? Everything bad, ever.<eos> Where's the body?<eos> Alaric is one witch away from finding it.
Look, I was the only woman in my surgical residency.<eos> You think those doctors would've taken me seriously if I didn't assert myself? Let me help you.<eos> - I don't know, Zoe.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> You're always saying that you like that I'm brave.<eos> Why don't we see if we can make you fearless too?<eos> AnnaBeth, that apple looks enticing.<eos> And I haven't eaten an itty bitty thing all day.<eos> - I should probably wash it for you first.<eos> - No. Don't let her take your apple, don't wash it for her.
Who was that?<eos> Neighbor.<eos> Said the vic's wife caught him cheating.<eos> Yeah, but we're not thinking it's the wife.<eos> Not unless she benches 350 and did the other guys as a warm-up.<eos> Shoot.<eos> I left Bobby's flask over at Lydia's.<eos> Lydia?<eos> My workout partner from last night.<eos> Now I've got to go get it.
I think you're enjoying this a little more than you need to. Screw it.<eos> I'm going over there and getting the flask.<eos> Don.<eos> Dean.<eos> I guess you didn't get my messages. No, I did.<eos> I've been busy.<eos> Anyway, I, uh, left that flask over here the other night.<eos> Yes.<eos> I found it.<eos> It was so beat up and old, I almost tossed it.
Dean.<eos> I guess you didn't get my messages. No, I did.<eos> I've been busy.<eos> Anyway, I, uh, left that flask over here the other night.<eos> Yes.<eos> I found it.<eos> It was so beat up and old, I almost tossed it.<eos> Yeah, well, guy it belonged to was beat up and old, too.<eos> But I was very close with him, and I'd, uh, I'd hate to lose it.<eos> I'll get it for you.
We're not gonna talk about this anymore because my skin's starting to crawl!<eos> All right, fine.<eos> But if it's true, if it happened...<eos> I know. I got to hang on to my hands and feet.<eos> We are so pleased with your progress.<eos> You are absorbing the traditions of our mothers, and you are close to fulfilling your tribal destiny, and taking your place alongside your sisters.<eos> Today, you are a warrior.<eos> Though you may walk among others, your heart is only with the tribe.<eos> Soon, you will take the final, glorious step into adulthood.<eos> Today, you will learn how to endure pain and how to inflict it.
What?<eos> Check out that guy over there.<eos> He seem a little out of it to you?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> What about Paula Deen over here?<eos> Yeah, they -- they look like like those Turducken people.<eos> It's starting.<eos> It's the corn syrup.<eos> Everything in the store is laced with it.
Never mind.<eos> Sweetheart, you get the job?<eos> How was it?<eos> It was really good.<eos> It was a great interview.<eos> They actually offered me the job right on the spot.<eos> I know, it has insurance and a 401 plan.<eos> The position is really, really fantastic.<eos> So...<eos> So I took it.
Yeah, that sounds too harsh.<eos> hey, you don't look too bad.<eos> I thought you'd walk back in here all bruised up and shit.<eos> the only violence was emotional.<eos> What did they do?<eos> oh, they took me out back... put me down on my knees.<eos> the big guy took down his pants.<eos> he took out his dick.<eos> it was very big, Tyler.<eos> he could have tied it into a pretzel.

I couldn't have done it without Jack's help.<eos> Really?<eos> They cover polycyclic hydrocarbons in sheriff school?<eos> No.<eos> Marshal services is more focused on catching bad guys.<eos> And deadly run away legs.<eos> I think, um, for me, what's most impressive is how you're using flexible microprocessors at one nanometer Q.D. For their current-carrying capacity.<eos> I think that's innovative.<eos> You read my article?<eos> Well, I, uh, scanned it.
Who?<eos> Who are we waiting for?<eos> You know what I love about my job?<eos> I'm the good guy.<eos> The law is on my side. I am the law.<eos> The law is me.<eos> I work for justice. I uphold the constitution of these United States.<eos> I am a knight for the people.<eos> I wear the white hat, and you, Olivia Carolyn Pope, you are a pain in my ass.<eos> I had a search warrant for that house, but by the time I got to use it, there was nothing there, because your people took whatever there was to find.
We'll use your invisibility to pull off a daring and complex casino heist.<eos> Of course, because no one can possibly know what I'm up to.<eos> I've summoned you to the chart room to explain how we're going to break into the casino vault, steal millions of dollars from under the mafia's nose, and return the casino to its rightful owners.<eos> Questions?<eos> Um, how come we've never been in this room before?<eos> I think this chart will answer that.<eos> Now, the heist.<eos> As you know, the main vault is here in the counting room on the top floor.<eos> But your dad said it's the galaxy's most secure safe.<eos> Yes, but they open it every day at 3:45 to load the take.
Life force!<eos> So, how do we get their "life forces" back?<eos> If we poke a hole in Cobb's bag, will they spew out like a volcano built on an Indian graveyard?<eos> Alas, it's not that simple.<eos> You e, just as the earth lichen is composed of an algae and a fungus, the quantum variety is also comped of two separed parts.<eos> An attractive algae-based id and a ravenous fungus based ego that stores the stolen souls.<eos> I mean, life forces.<eos> Now, here's the weird pa.<eos> The ego and the id are connected not physically, like decent, God-fearing earth liens, but by quantum entanglement.<eos> So the id is Langdon Cobb, but this fungus ego could be... Anywhere, we'll never find it!
It's supposed to be beer and bratwurst, not breakups and... Boring thing!<eos> For hundreds of years, Oktoberfest has been held here, in the fertile neander valley, where prehistoric man once hunted the majestic schnüfel-üfagus, or woolly mammoth.<eos> To this day, paleontologists sometimes find entire mammoths frozen in the valley's icy glaciers, perfectly preserved for exactly 30,000 years or so.<eos> Wait a minute...<eos> Mammoth meat aged for 30,000 years?<eos> Prize-winning sausage meat, here I come!<eos> I didn't know this ship had a mammoth detector.<eos> You're drunk, Fry.<eos> This is the elephant detector.<eos> I just set it to "big and woolly."
I give up.<eos> It's time to face the fact that I'll never do anything remotely interesting or unexpected again.<eos> Hand it over.<eos> Wha...?<eos> Mom may have fallen for your lies, but not me.<eos> You invented the free will unit, then you selfishly hid it beyond the reach of my stealers.<eos> Thanks to you, I went on a soul-searching journey.<eos> I hate those!<eos> Now, give up the free will.<eos> I should have destroyed it, but I was too damn proud of myself.

I expect Uncle Spiros will always find you a holiday job here.<eos> Hello.<eos> Lars, yeah.<eos> I'm just ... I'm just.<eos> What is it?<eos> - Did you get the loan?<eos> Bad news I'm afraid.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're going home. We got it!
We're having fun.<eos> Come back to the shop and let me cook you something to eat.<eos> Go on. We're doing great business.<eos> I'm actually thinking of expanding.<eos> That's ah...<eos> That's good, Harry. That's very good. I'm happy for you.<eos> If this is success.<eos> What is success, Rob?<eos> What is it?<eos> We've both had it. What is it?
I mean, I've lost 2 sets of headphones and an mp3 player just this term alone.<eos> Although, I did notice that some of us seem to be exempt from this little... stuff snatching epidemic.<eos> Funny how that works, huh?<eos> Guys it's not just our playlists and players we're being deprived of you know?<eos> Music is the soundtrack to our lives.<eos> It's, it's where we've been and where we're going and everywhere in between.<eos> Our music is who we are.<eos> Are we gonna let someone just snatch that away from us... or are we gonna change the game?<eos> Here's a new song about, uh, trying things you never thought you could.<eos> Look, I've been trying to do a bunch of new things lately, and this song severely inspires me, so check it out.

Miss Fisher needs you down at the Turkish baths in Little Lonsdale.<eos> I hope she's comfortable.<eos> She could be waiting a long time.<eos> Sasha.<eos> Sasha, don't fall asleep.<eos> I told you - Cokey and The Bull.<eos> They dragged off this Russian dago and she went after him.<eos> Some commo friend of yours, was he?<eos> If only my eyes could focus in this fog.<eos> If the steam's piped in, we just need to pipe it out again.
Good observation.<eos> After they'd plundered several ships in the Caribbean, the Black Galleon got stranded nearby on Crocodile Island, named for the tooth-shaped rocks that jut out on the shore.<eos> Legend has it that survivors buried their treasure, but were then killed by a monstrous beast.<eos> Locals nicknamed it "The Bork."<eos> -The Bork?<eos> -It's a mutant creature.<eos> Half bear, half pork.<eos> -Is the treasure still there?<eos> -Probably.<eos> People from all over have tried to find it, -to no avail.
Wait, Gyslaine.<eos> Wait!<eos> I don't know how!<eos> -It tickles! -Gyslaine!<eos> Gyslaine!<eos> Gyslaine, my turtledove?<eos> Enjoy your meal.<eos> Gyslaine?<eos> I'd find the treasure if I could get to the island.<eos> If it existed, someone would've found it.
Do you have anything in yellow and black?<eos> -OK.<eos> Hervé, I need your opinion on this bathing suit.<eos> Do you think it's maybe a little too... revealing?<eos> No, it's... no...<eos> It's from our Copacabana line.<eos> Oh, that's why there's so little material!<eos> -I love Brazil.<eos> -Do I take it?<eos> Take it.
Well, well, well! -What shenanigans are you up to?<eos> -Nothing, just some crafts.<eos> Really?<eos> That's not what Gratin had to say.<eos> I hope you didn't mention...<eos> Simmer down. Tell me more about this treasure.<eos> Never!<eos> Then I'll report you to the police for poisoning me.<eos> Where did you find that seafood?<eos> I'll help you find the treasure, and we split it 3 ways.
Why? We have two fireballs headed into town.<eos> They're going after heat sources.<eos> What the...<eos> Yeah, I think I just found one.<eos> Allie, get out of there.<eos> Working on it.<eos> Allie, what's going on?<eos> It's following me.<eos> It's going after the combustion engine.<eos> What's it gonna do when it finds it?
Holly.<eos> I told you.<eos> - No, but Holly, don't...<eos> - Holly, Holly... Don't worry, it's not real.<eos> Holly!<eos> I'm sorry it hurts. Yeah. Isn't that cool?<eos> You don't know what kind of dragon bacteria that thing has under its nails.<eos> Doug, let's look at this logically.<eos> "A"... my arm totally hurts.<eos> "B"... it hurts because it was scratched by a dragon.
What's going on?<eos> We're under attack.<eos> From who?<eos> Unknown!<eos> A pulse weapon has knocked out the power grid, communications are down and we have voltage spikes in the reactor turbines.<eos> Radar is tracking an incoming missile.<eos> How close?<eos> 30 seconds to impact. HENRY:<eos> Close.<eos> The EM shield will knock it out before impact, if we can keep it online.
That.<eos> Warning.<eos> Power grid failure imminent.<eos> Initiate emergency protocols.<eos> Is it just me, or are you getting a crazy sense of déjà vu?<eos> The reactor is under control, but the main power won't be restored for another eight to ten hours.<eos> The auxiliary should maintain the emergency systems, communication, and the EM shield.<eos> Okay, well, that's something, right?<eos> Whoever opened the liquid nitrogen valve in Clark's lab, also used the same code to take down the power grid.<eos> Can we trace it back to the source?

Any sign of intrusion? Besides him?<eos> No.<eos> But I did find this weird bitstream rattling around in the mainframe.<eos> Where?<eos> It's all over.<eos> It's like a ghost.<eos> It disappears from one subsystem and then it pops up in another.<eos> That's the problem right there.<eos> I'm deploying a level 6 antivirus to purge the G.D. system.<eos> Whatever your ghost is, Panop will kill it.
Actually, that's pretty cool.<eos> No. No, not cool.<eos> Not cool.<eos> Bad. Wormholes are bad.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I Just activated my strong-force amplifier.<eos> Oh, maybe at around the same time the Jeep came screaming into the rotunda?<eos> Okay, yeah, I admit the timing is a little odd, but there's absolutely no way that this could be responsible.<eos> Then turn it off.
We've already started the quantum data transfer of all their files to our off-site server in D.C.<eos> Grace is running out of time.<eos> Please, Zane.<eos> But for you I can try.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Dr. Parrish.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> Miss Lupo.<eos> Are you here to assist me with the move?<eos> Actually, we're here to see if you're trying to stop it.
Well, this wasn't exactly what I pictured for our honeymoon, but I do like the sound of the rain.<eos> This isn't such a bad place.<eos> It has potential.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Baby, are you okay? I'm okay.<eos> Here, take...<eos> Well, you said you liked the rain.<eos> This body is super bendy.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> Um, and you should probably start referring to it as my body.
Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> What you doing?<eos> Nothing. L...<eos> I was... I was... I was just going home, I guess.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Kicking your tire.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - No. Please, kick it.
Hi.<eos> What you doing?<eos> Nothing. L...<eos> I was... I was... I was just going home, I guess.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Kicking your tire.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - No. Please, kick it.<eos> Kick it all you want.
There's a rock right there!<eos> There's a huge rock right there, and it's covered up by grass and there's no way you can see it.
Are you sure?<eos> Are you sure you didn't just sleep on it funny?<eos> Does this look like I slept on it funny? !<eos> I'm gonna tell Mom!<eos> Mom!<eos> You are not going anywhere.<eos> I finally have a date with Miss Emily tomorrow, and I'm not gonna let you or anybody else get in my way until I have seen every inch of her naked.<eos> Do you even hear yourself?<eos> ! And what am I supposed to do about my arm?<eos> ! I'll just pop it back in.
! And what am I supposed to do about my arm?<eos> ! I'll just pop it back in.<eos> You most certainly will not!<eos> I need to go to a hospital.<eos> Brian, is Stewie in there with you?<eos> Mom!<eos> We're in here, Lois.<eos> He's napping.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm gonna pop it back in.
Oh, those are some advanced mathematical formulas I've just been tinkering with.<eos> You're kidding?<eos> I do that, too.<eos> But what are these formulas for?<eos> For these.<eos> Oh, my God, you've got a weapons room, too?<eos> And look at the size of it.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Yes, although sometimes I think it's too big.<eos> It takes the cleaning woman forever to clean it.
You did?<eos> I sure did.<eos> Well, then, hey... what do you say we go home, huh?<eos> Sounds good to me.<eos> Oh, Brian, there you are!<eos> Thank God.<eos> Oh, hey, Stewie.<eos> Did you make that coffee?<eos> Um, no, it was here when I came in.<eos> I assume Lois made it.
Joe Workingman!<eos> Good afternoon, friends and socioeconomic equals!<eos> Is anyone else out there sick of government crap?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's like he's saying everything I'm listening to.<eos> That's right.<eos> The government wants to tell you what foods to eat.<eos> And what church you can go to.<eos> And that you can't own a chimpanzee because you're not responsible enough.<eos> I would feed it!
Ugh! Your roots are ridiculous.<eos> I'm gonna grab your hair 'cause I like grabbing stuff.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, Stewie, let go.<eos> Let, let go, Stewie.<eos> Let go of Mommy's hair. When I grow up, I'm never gonna call you.<eos> I'm gonna be busy with my job and my family.<eos> You'll be nothing.<eos> Stewie, I want you to have my ring.<eos> It's one of my most important possessions, and I want you to have it.
Okay, look, Benjamin and I... we were suitemates in college.<eos> Benjamin, I can't wait to get to L.A.<eos> We're going to have so much sex... in the morning, in the afternoon, at bedtime.<eos> Mmm, peanuts. I'm telling you, man,<eos> I'm gonna run that town one day.<eos> You'll see.<eos> I'm gonna write you a check right now for $100 million. How do you like that?<eos> Damn, dude.<eos> And this is a real check.<eos> You can cash it when I'm rich and awesome.
- Cocoon.<eos> ...that will one day release your butterfly"?<eos> No, it does not say that one!<eos> - That's number three.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Why are you doing this to me?<eos> - Maybe I just got bored painting over your interplanetary ass dojo.<eos> This is my favorite.<eos> "Find out where Winston gets his sparkle,<eos> - and then steal it." - Oh!
So, I guess it'll just be me and Jess.<eos> Oh, no, Remy.<eos> I changed my mind;<eos> I'll be there.<eos> Just watching you.<eos> Remy brought a bottle of... this?<eos> I ferment things in the basement.<eos> I also make cheese.<eos> Hm, you're not drinking that, Jess.<eos> Yes, I am, Remy made it.
Something always happens.<eos> Things are different.<eos> Somebody tells a joke and you don't know what they're talking about.<eos> There have been no jokes, not without you.<eos> Not even at my expense?<eos> I'm terribly adrift without you.<eos> It's just a matter of time before they find out I'm a sham.<eos> Nobody came to visit me.<eos> They sent flowers with some stupid card written by the florist.<eos> There would have been a cake, but you weren't here to arrange it.
Christ, you're pathetic.<eos> You bed-wetting excuse for a son.<eos> Can I borrow your truck?<eos> - Not a chance.<eos> - It's for me.<eos> I need to see a doctor.<eos> Oh.<eos> Take the bus.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll bring it back with a full tank.
How could you leave her like that, drunk out of her mind?<eos> she's married to you.<eos> That's your job.<eos> She left my house a happy girl.<eos> And you show up and she's miserable.<eos> I know it's hard to watch, but this is what happens when you have the artistic temperament, but you are not an artist.<eos> Take my advice, nurse her through this defeat and you shall have the life you desire.<eos> I have postcards to write.<eos> You almost had a nasty abscess.<eos> You should have had it extracted days ago.
You almost had a nasty abscess.<eos> You should have had it extracted days ago.<eos> I kept thinking it would go away.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You're lucky didn't lose your jaw.<eos> Just breathe through your nose.<eos> You're in bad shape, Dick.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I lost my job when I died.<eos> I'm gonna do you a favor and take it out. But it's not your tooth that's rotten.
- Oh.<eos> - What plan?<eos> Anyway, I've primed him for another dinner when all should be revealed and it's on the books.<eos> That's not what I told you to do.<eos> Lane, I think Roger and I, and probably Don, should take your friend out to a dinner which is strictly business.<eos> Ask all the rough questions, brag about you, then allow you to swoop in, his new best friend, and shine the chrome.<eos> I don't know if that's necessary.<eos> Roger, tell him that's the way the plan always works.<eos> Sure.<eos> You wouldn't want to hit a golf ball off the tee when you could hit it from the green.
There's no other place like this.<eos> You're right.<eos> It wasn't as nice.<eos> We called it a whorehouse.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> So, expert, what do you think?<eos> Should I get a TV in here?<eos> No.<eos> Jessica, I've got his drinks.<eos> Well, gentlemen, I asked for fun and I got it.
Men don't take the time to end things.<eos> They ignore you until you insist on a declaration of hate.<eos> Someone dumped you?<eos> Peggy, I'm just like everybody else.<eos> If he's going to end it, which I doubt, you'll know what to do.<eos> If he's going to propose, you'd better have your answer prepared, especially if it's no.<eos> Gosh.<eos> I should go home and change, shouldn't I?<eos> Or better yet, go shopping.<eos> So the mom's wearing the glass space helmet and the kid took his off and put it on the table?
We are being lowered in a bucket into a gold mine.<eos> I'm gonna bring my pick and crack something off the wall.<eos> I don't think it's that kind of atmosphere.<eos> You actually saying that with a straight face?<eos> You forget why you wrote that letter?<eos> Are you forgetting you said it would kill our business?<eos> So you think cigarettes are bad and so are the people who sell them?<eos> It's what they think.<eos> Mary Lasker and the rest of them know it as the truth.<eos> It doesn't matter why I wrote it.
You shouldn't give up.<eos> I wouldn't tell you this if I didn't think you had talent.<eos> The other day they asked me to take Stan's originals down to the printer, and I thought all I have to do is throw these in the trash and they'll fire me or at least they'd yell at me<eos> and I could cry enough and quit.<eos> And then I realized they'll never fire me.<eos> You want to quit?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do I do?<eos> You know there are people killing to get this job.<eos> You're taking up a spot and you don't even wanna do it?
Tired?<eos> You're Ali?<eos> Get in.<eos> You took your time!<eos> - I've been looking for an hour. - Move.<eos> I called Anna. I couldn't find you.<eos> Like my truck?<eos> You really do?<eos> I don't like boys who don't like my truck!<eos> So you want it?
Nothing but dust.<eos> Flecks of dust.<eos> It's stifling in here.<eos> Aren't you talking to me today?<eos> I'm sorry about yesterday.<eos> I didn't mean to upset you.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll show you a magical place.<eos> It's a magical place.<eos> No one knows about it.
Does that sound OK?<eos> Can I stay at yours until we go?<eos> Come over tomorrow morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you find my passport?<eos> Well, its got to be around here somewhere!<eos> I'm not having it.
I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.<eos> I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, lmp.<eos> If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself.<eos> Instead she sends you.<eos> What am I to make of that?<eos> I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately.<eos> And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?<eos> As I said several times.<eos> And you've waited this long to deliver the information?<eos> When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay.
When I was 11 my father took me to Boston to see a game.<eos> It was a doubleheader between the Boston Red Sox and the Yankees.<eos> Dad pulled a baseball out of his pocket and he said to me,<eos> "You go down there to that dugout and get Babe Ruth to sign that ball. "<eos> I'm going to tell you right out of the bush I was scared to death.<eos> Anyhow, so down I go.<eos> Babe Ruth said to me, "Why sure, Sonny, I'll sign your ball. "<eos> Then, at the other end of the dugout, Lou Gehrig was looking at some bats. He signed her, too.<eos> Well, sir, that ball is famous even today.<eos> Lelands wanted to put it in their auction down in New York.
All right.<eos> The Babe Ruth baseball is in the kitchen cupboard in an old flour tin.<eos> Yeah, I already knew that.<eos> Mom told us.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Your mother never could keep a secret.<eos> I got a call last year. A guy offered me $40,000 for that ball.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> $40,000 for a baseball.<eos> All these years, were you ever tempted to sell it?
I will hear no more.<eos> My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.<eos> It's not the only thing.<eos> They're quite good at killing the better men.<eos> That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.<eos> Mother of Dragons.<eos> On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you.<eos> A demonstration?<eos> Take this gem.<eos> Look at it.
There's nowhere to go.<eos> You can't hide from me.<eos> Got you.<eos> Truck was on its usual route in the southeast.<eos> Driver said the rear loader got jammed.<eos> Got out to take a look, found the body.<eos> How many stops did he make before he got here?<eos> He's not sure.<eos> He started at 6:30 this morning.<eos> Luckily he found it before it got to the dump, otherwise he would have never been found.
Don't.<eos> You're too late.<eos> We ate yours. Doesn't matter.<eos> I'll just have a drink.<eos> Where's your suit?<eos> - Which suit?<eos> - The one you wore to our party.<eos> I'll take it, get it cleaned.<eos> - I took it in already.<eos> - Give me the ticket. I'll collect it.
- Which suit?<eos> - The one you wore to our party.<eos> I'll take it, get it cleaned.<eos> - I took it in already.<eos> - Give me the ticket. I'll collect it.<eos> - I think I lost it.<eos> - Come on, what happened to it?<eos> I was in such a state that night with the drink, I just binned it.<eos> - You binned your best suit?<eos> - Yeah, it was in a state, so I binned it.

You... you don't have to do that.<eos> After what you tried to do last night, I don't have a choice.<eos> But I'm fine.<eos> Last night was just a moment of temporary insanity.<eos> In the light of day, I feel absolutely...<eos> Did you take the laces out of all my sneakers?<eos> Yeah, and I also got rid of all your knives, razors, pills, cleaning fluid, and your shower curtain.<eos> How could I kill myself with a shower curtain?<eos> You can't.<eos> I just thought it was ugly.
How can you know that?<eos> I just know.<eos> He is never... coming back.<eos> I promise.<eos> Oh, my, a pool, too?<eos> I wish I'd known.<eos> I would have brought my bathing suit.<eos> This is wonderful, by the way.<eos> Yeah, it was one of my favorites.<eos> I picked it up on a wine tasting trip through the south of France last summer.
And, of course, when I say "us," including you.<eos> Mike.<eos> Mike, if he taped all that shit...<eos> Us cooking, you picking up...<eos> If Gus had a record of that and the police get to it before we do...<eos> - Mike, it's all on tape somewhere, or a hard drive.<eos> Where?<eos> Where did he keep it?<eos> He had a laptop in his office.<eos> He kept it at the back of the restaurant.
You know how they say<eos> "it's been a pleasure"?<eos> It hasn't.<eos> Are you going to tell us about the laptop?<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - I'm gettin' the hell out of dodge, kid, and so should you.<eos> It's just a matter of time.<eos> Mike, where is the laptop?<eos> What the hell difference does it make?<eos> They got it.

Outside!<eos> Outside!<eos> Yes! Bitch!<eos> - Shut up.<eos> What exactly are you celebrating?<eos> You left the truck behind.<eos> So what?<eos> So what?<eos> So what if they find prints?<eos> And what if they trace it back to the wrecking yard?
So your brother could put that stuff in there.<eos> Henry, I'm shocked.<eos> And you two-just who do you think you are?<eos> A fine specimen.<eos> The wood it provides will keep our family's hearth warm this winter.<eos> - Can't I have an ax? - Huh?<eos> You did say you wanted me here so I could help.<eos> That I did.<eos> So here's your task- take the cart.<eos> Go fill it with kindling.
It's the only thing that I have from... From my parents.<eos> I spent a lot of time with a lot of kids in your situation, and all of them...<eos> All of us... We held on to stuff.<eos> I want to find your father, but I need your help.<eos> Is there anything of his you've held on to?<eos> I might have something.<eos> But if I give it to you, you'll make sure we stay together, right?<eos> Right.<eos> A compass?<eos> Our mom kept it.
How can you be sure she's sleeping?<eos> I can't.<eos> And remember what the Queen said.<eos> Not even a lick.<eos> You're right.<eos> Look.<eos> And there's the satchel.<eos> What do you think's inside it?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> All that matters is getting it to the Queen so she can find father.
Because those kids are supposed to be in Boston tonight.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Oh! Yes.<eos> Nice and tender.<eos> A succulent roast you'll make.<eos> - Quick!<eos> - She's gonna cook me!<eos> We gotta do something quick!<eos> Stay calm. When she opens the cage to get you, don't try to fight.<eos> Then while she's carrying you to the oven, grab the key that's in her pocket and toss it to me through the bars.
Yeah.<eos> Any place to get a room around here?<eos> Uh, you're staying?<eos> That's the plan.<eos> Just looking for a bed.<eos> Granny's bed and breakfast is just up the road.<eos> Another two blocks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I didn't catch your name.<eos> That's 'cause I didn't give it.
- It's no secret things aren't perfect between him and I.<eos> I spent so much time keeping my head down just carrying out my duties as a wife, as a mother, as a size two.<eos> Sometimes I have to remind myself to look up and think about the things that I want, and then I did and there you were standing in the wrong place at the wrong time, I guess.<eos> - I guess.<eos> - My marriage may not be perfect but, George, I'm fixing to rediscover myself.<eos> I'm fixing to laser-engrave my own happiness into a glistening ball of crystal.<eos> I'm a store owner, I'm an entrepreneur I'm an independent woman in the 2000-teens.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> The job is still yours if you want it.<eos> - I want it.
Not after tonight.<eos> When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand.<eos> - Gods be good.<eos> - God.<eos> Father, there is only one and he watches over us.<eos> - But not over them?<eos> - Over all of us.<eos> The people of King's Landing did not choose the false King Joffrey Baratheon.<eos> They will be glad to see his head on a spike.<eos> Well, first we have to put it there.
You didn't, though.<eos> - You really remember? - Mm.<eos> You knew when you were needed and when to go away.<eos> It's a rare talent.<eos> Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.<eos> Well, when I think back to that day--<eos> You were saying?<eos> I-- never mind. It's embarrassing.<eos> More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?<eos> I remember everything about that day-- your helmet, your horse, the rake line in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me.
Well, no Kubrick film's really just a regular movie.<eos> I understood that from, well, when I was 10 years old and I first saw 2001.<eos> I walked away.<eos> I thought, "This is a film that's supposed to make me think."<eos> I had my first religious experience seeing the film A Space Odyssey in 1968.<eos> I was a smart kid and liked art, but I really did not like movies and thought that they were really a substandard art.<eos> And, you know, films like My Fair Lady and Doctor Dolittle were out.<eos> And it was a rather pathetic time in the '60s for films.<eos> And my girlfriend, she pulled up and told me that she'd seen a movie the night before and she wanted to see it again.<eos> So she took me to the theater, the Cinerama Dome, and I watched it.
That... people walk backwards in the film, you know, people talk backwards.<eos> Redrum.<eos> Redrum.<eos> You know, if you reverse the film, it has a format similar to 2001.<eos> All these kind of things happen.<eos> At the end of The Shining, he's reduced to a screaming ape, just like in the beginning of 2001, there are screaming apes.<eos> But I was talking to my pals at the Spectacle Theater, riffing about experimental ways of showing films.<eos> And they were like, "Well, do you think "you could come up with something, you know, to show here?"<eos> I was like, "Sure, what we should do is we should show The Shining forwards and backwards at the same time.<eos> "You know not... let's not be creative. "Let's just actually reverse the film and show it exactly mirrored, superimposed."
I'm at my computer. Send it through.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Got an I.D. On the print from the judge's house.<eos> Got a match from the Navy.<eos> One of your parolees?<eos> Nope.<eos> Name's Vince Chilton.<eos> Got no record at all.<eos> See if we can get a match on a driver's license.<eos> Renewed it two months ago.
There she is.<eos> He's still in there.<eos> Quem e ela?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He asked who you were.<eos> Don't get your hopes up.<eos> Have your boyfriend give me those samples.<eos> How'd you even know to look for a tumor?<eos> Well, Dr. House noticed hormone levels in your blood, and consulted me as an oncologist.<eos> Who cares how they found it, okay?
Gallants,<eos> I am not as I have been.<eos> So say I, methinks you are sadder.<eos> I hope he be in love.<eos> Hang him truant! There's no true drop of blood in him, to be truly touched with love.<eos> If he be sad, he wants money.<eos> I (SIGHS) have the toothache.<eos> What?<eos> Sigh for the toothache?<eos> Well, every one can master a grief but he that has it.
It is a man's office, but not yours.<eos> I do love nothing in the world so well as you.<eos> Is not that strange?<eos> As strange as the thing I know not.<eos> It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so much as you.<eos> But believe me not, and yet I lie not.<eos> I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing.<eos> I am sorry for my cousin.<eos> By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.<eos> Do not swear, and eat it.
Yes, it's a Convotherme.<eos> This is written there.<eos> No... yes... is way to tell. Is a steam oven.<eos> Fits fish, vegetables, some meats at low temperatures...<eos> I present Mr. Luchet, maître charge of the private service.<eos> Only exceptionally know in advance how many people will be at the table.<eos> Generally be advised at 11:00 am... For a lunch that will be served at 13:15.<eos> Which will give you two hours to prepare it forcing her to perform here every morning.<eos> It's me who should submit the suggestion menu.<eos> Submit it'll secretariat of the President that in return it corrected or uncorrected, to be sent to the printer.
Amen to that.<eos> You know you got 21/2 bottles of whiskey on ice and no beer?<eos> That can happen.<eos> Wait.<eos> You can't drink any of that shit anyway.<eos> Well, I can have one.<eos> Who says?<eos> My mom.<eos> She used to have a couple drinks a night when she was carrying me.<eos> She'd put her ashtray, balance it on her great big belly.
Mum, he's used to it.<eos> That's true.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's trying the new ball with the boy.<eos> Did he wear his hat?<eos> I hope he has.<eos> Or he'll get an earful!<eos> Jacques!<eos> Tiemoko!<eos> I've found it.
Thanks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Grey.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Now I like her.<eos> Um, that's, like, the fourth time you've had to revive him tonight.<eos> Is that normal?<eos> His body has been through a lot.<eos> What are those tubes for?<eos> Uh, his body is filling with fluid, and those tubes are draining it.
It's awfully frustrating not knowing, isn't it?<eos> - Just tell me.<eos> - Why?<eos> Is it illegal to carry around a box in these parts?<eos> No, of course it's not.<eos> You really wanna know what's inside it, don't you?<eos> No.<eos> Well, maybe.<eos> I'm gonna make you wait.<eos> You're gonna have to wait a long time and watch me carry it around, hauling it to strange and mysterious places.
It tore their throats so fast that not one of them got a chance to scream, or pray,<eos> or say goodbye.<eos> When my father died, I tumbled from the roof.<eos> And I landed in the blood in front of the wolf.<eos> I felt its breath on my face.<eos> And it clamped its hot jaw on my arm and I rolled away.<eos> Then it looked at me with eyes so black they weren't even there.<eos> And it walked away.<eos> You ever see a wild animal just turn its back and walk away like you don't matter?<eos> If this wolf is like that one, there is no defeating it.

I know you say you don't know what you are, but whatever it is, I gotta say, I'm impressed.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I was scared out of my mind.<eos> But you did it anyway.<eos> You knew?<eos> Of course I knew.<eos> Her mother was one too before a hunting party killed her.<eos> I thought maybe Red didn't get it, but when she was 13, it started.<eos> I paid a wizard for that cloak.<eos> It keeps her from turning, but she doesn't wear it, and she's found some way out of the house.
Found out I could do that.<eos> And also that I don't want to.<eos> I don't want a job where a good day means ruining someone's life.<eos> I wanna do something that makes me happy.<eos> Somewhere I love.<eos> Look, just so you know, I wanted you to do the books and everything so you can take over when I retire.<eos> Own the whole place.<eos> - Own it?<eos> - Sure.<eos> I mean, who else would I give it to but someone who loves me back?
- I think so.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm not used to sharing the road with cars so late.<eos> You're the Sheriff, aren't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What brings you out here in the middle of the night?<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> I'm just looking for a lost dog.<eos> I hope you find it.
Emma!<eos> What is going on?<eos> Emma! Thank God!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was in the woods trying to get away, when this man appeared out of nowhere and grabbed me.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I'm trying to find you.<eos> How did you get out?<eos> There was a key. In my cell, under my pillow.<eos> Someone put it there.
I understand.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who?<eos> Who?<eos> I hate Wonderland.<eos> Make one like that.<eos> You want me to make a hat?<eos> You don't have enough? Well, none of them work, do they?<eos> Or else you wouldn't be here.<eos> Now make a hat and get it to work.
How arrogant are you to think yours is the only one?<eos> There are infinite more.<eos> You have to open your mind. They touch one another. Pressing up in along line of lands.<eos> Each just as real as the last.<eos> All have their own rules. Some have magic.<eos> Some don't.<eos> And some need magic. Like this one.<eos> And that's where you come in.<eos> You and your friend are not leaving here until you make my hat.<eos> Until you get it to work.
Off with his head.<eos> No.<eos> I'm alive.<eos> I'm alive!<eos> If you wish your body back, then answer.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> The hat.<eos> My hat. We used my hat.<eos> Where is the hat now?<eos> She took it.
My hat. We used my hat.<eos> Where is the hat now?<eos> She took it.<eos> Regina.<eos> If all you require to travel to your homeland is this magic hat, then surely you can make another?<eos> I can't.<eos> A hat without magic is just a hat.<eos> It won't work.<eos> Then there's your task.<eos> Get it to work.

You told me you could help me with Mary Margaret, and I wanted to believe you.<eos> But eventually, there are things that even a blind sheriff... Cannot ignore.<eos> Is that a bug?<eos> Oh, for God sakes, Sidney, drop it.<eos> You fooled me, you spied on me, and you reported it all back to that sick, crazy woman.<eos> I can't even imagine what she has on you, but it must be something huge.<eos> She's a good mayor.<eos> She tried to get Mary Margaret convicted of a murder that didn't even happen.<eos> You're in a lot of trouble.<eos> There is a D.N.A. trail in a basement of some house out there, and I'm gonna find it, and she's gonna go away.
And now that I've finally found you... I know I can't make up for the past, for the lost time.<eos> All I can do is to ask you to do what you've always done... that's to be the bigger man... And forgive me.<eos> I'm so sorry, son.<eos> I'm so sorry, Bae.<eos> Oh. Oh, my boy.<eos> My beautiful boy.<eos> Can you truly, truly forgive me?<eos> I forgive you, papa.<eos> You were looking for the knife.<eos> I thought that if you still had it, it would mean that you hadn't changed.
I'm so sorry, son.<eos> I'm so sorry, Bae.<eos> Oh. Oh, my boy.<eos> My beautiful boy.<eos> Can you truly, truly forgive me?<eos> I forgive you, papa.<eos> You were looking for the knife.<eos> I thought that if you still had it, it would mean that you hadn't changed.<eos> Well, let's go and find it and see.<eos> I buried it here shortly after Emma came to town.
Oh. Oh, my boy.<eos> My beautiful boy.<eos> Can you truly, truly forgive me?<eos> I forgive you, papa.<eos> You were looking for the knife.<eos> I thought that if you still had it, it would mean that you hadn't changed.<eos> Well, let's go and find it and see.<eos> I buried it here shortly after Emma came to town.<eos> Things were changing.<eos> Didn't want to take the chance of Regina finding it.
No one here remembers.<eos> And yet you do.<eos> You're from there, aren't you?<eos> From my world.<eos> The fact that you're asking the question means you know the answer.<eos> Well, now that that's settled...<eos> How about my other question?<eos> Who told you about me and the knife?<eos> A little fairy.<eos> Why did you want it?
You changed it.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Your help.<eos> And what makes you think I won't kill you after everything you've done?<eos> Because you don't have it in you.<eos> If you did, you would have done it 28 years ago, when I brought you here.<eos> Because you know if I'm dead, you'll never get back to your daughter.<eos> And I have a way for us to both get what we want.<eos> My hat.<eos> I want you to use it again.
Haven't we both suffered enough?<eos> No.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's just a morsel.<eos> Did you know that apples stand for health and wisdom?<eos> So why do I get the feeling that one might kill me?<eos> It won't kill you.<eos> No, what it will do is far worse.<eos> Your body will be your tomb, and you'll be in there with nothing but dreams formed of your own regrets.<eos> And you're going to force me to eat it.
And why's that?<eos> Because I found a solution to my Emma Swan problem.<eos> Oh, yes?<eos> An old reliable solution.<eos> A sleeping curse.<eos> Might I ask how you managed to obtain one here in Storybrooke?<eos> By sacrificing the last bit of magic I had left.<eos> So you made magic from magic.<eos> Well, I'm sure I don't have to remind you that, uh, all magic comes with a price.<eos> Then you can pay it.
My mother's ring.<eos> It was just...<eos> How did you get it?<eos> The same way I get everything I want.<eos> Magic.<eos> The same magic that allows me to do this.<eos> This ring is now enchanted.<eos> The closer you get to Snow White, the brighter it will glow.<eos> Interested?<eos> - Give it to me.
And where's that?<eos> Inside the belly of a beast, of course.<eos> Why hide it?<eos> Let's just say I'm saving it for a rainy day.<eos> Do my eyes deceive me, or is that the look of a believer?<eos> We need your help.<eos> Indeed you do.<eos> It seems quite the tragic ailment has befallen our young friend.<eos> I told you magic comes with a price.<eos> Henry shouldn't have to pay it.
I can't die looking at you.<eos> Well, close your eyes. It was too hot.<eos> Hold my nose, suffocate me.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah. Same idea as the bag, but it'll go quicker.<eos> Well, should I wash my hands first?<eos> Just do it.<eos> How's that?<eos> I am still breathing out of this mouth.<eos> Okay, well, I can cover it with my other hand.
That was the thing about Chatswin.<eos> You never knew what trend was gonna hit next.<eos> [GRUNTS]<eos> JILL:<eos> Noah.<eos> - Yes, my love?<eos> I asked you to fix the damn showerhead.<eos> Fix the showerhead, Noah.<eos> - Jill, you're bleeding.<eos> - Fix it.
[GRUNTS]<eos> JILL:<eos> Noah.<eos> - Yes, my love?<eos> I asked you to fix the damn showerhead.<eos> Fix the showerhead, Noah.<eos> - Jill, you're bleeding.<eos> - Fix it.<eos> GEORGE:<eos> So did you fix it?
Was it his... penis that was pointing?<eos> I think so. I can't remember.<eos> So he showed you his penis?<eos> Do you feel uncomfortable talking about Lucas?<eos> But it's because you don't like what he did?<eos> Klara, I think that you... you're doing really well, and you're very good at answering my questions.<eos> And we're almost done, okay?<eos> What did he do afterwards, when he showed you his penis?<eos> I don't really know.<eos> Did you touch it?
So that's how I figure we'll infiltrate headquarters.<eos> Once we're in, I'll boot up their system.<eos> Sarah, you'll plant the virus using this and we'll destroy the Intersect, once and for all.<eos> - That seems a little drastic.<eos> - Yeah, it is drastic.<eos> Think of all the Intersect is responsible for.<eos> My father's death. Volkoff's very existence.<eos> Morgan's brain melting. Sarah.<eos> Let's just say it's been more bad than good.<eos> When my dad found out I had it, he told me to destroy it and I wish I had.
What's the matter?<eos> This, this laptop is an old Prism Express.<eos> Configuration could be tricky.<eos> Okay, what about Irene Demova?<eos> Sarah, that's brilliant.<eos> That's brilliant.<eos> The, the virus could circumvent the system and disarm the bomb.<eos> That was five years ago;<eos> you remembered.<eos> Chuck, Chuck, find the porn virus, find it now.
I'm so sorry. Would you mind signing this before I go?<eos> - I just have to--<eos> Damn it, Charlie.<eos> I needed that signature.<eos> Don't freak out, okay?<eos> There was Vicodin in the smoothie.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Do not tell me that, Charlie.<eos> You only took a sip.<eos> I didn't realize that you even picked it up.
Really?<eos> Then those are the ugliest pair of flesh pants I've ever seen.<eos> Oh, Dinty Moore again?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You love this stuff.<eos> Yeah, but don't give me the one with the low sodium.<eos> It tastes like dog shit.<eos> What, and the one with full sodium doesn't?<eos> No, actually, it's delicious.<eos> So, I could pick up a pile of dog shit and you'd eat it?
Nah, I think he's past the dance.<eos> Looks like he's gonna need around-the-clock care soon.<eos> Hmm, can he afford that?<eos> Funny you should ask.<eos> I have a plan. Uh-oh.<eos> What uh-oh?<eos> Sometimes your plans can be a little crazy-pants, Kev-<eos> - Case in point.<eos> Yeah, but you like that plan now.<eos> I'm on the road to liking it.
- That's - Don't do that.<eos> Top of the morning.<eos> Let's go to the Alibi.<eos> Come on.<eos> I wanna meet all your co-workers.<eos> - I don't - My shift doesn't start until noon.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what they say:<eos> The early bird catches the worm.<eos> - I caught it. - Yeah.
-l'm serious. I want to do it.<eos> I want to set up a camera so I can catch it.<eos> So it's just gonna run all the time?<eos> Yeah. This is an amazing computer for a six-year-old, by the way.<eos> Yeah, he got my hand-me-down.<eos> And then just face it towards over here.<eos> That'll be good.<eos> Where does your mom keep the laptop?<eos> Over there, in the corner.<eos> What does she use it for?
Hi. welcome back to Cooking with Chef Mary.<eos> I'm frequently asked basic questions about the kitchen.<eos> After that, cut the bell pepper into long strips.<eos> Finally, pile all of the red bell pepper strips together...<eos> Mom!<eos> -Wyatt?<eos> -You're ready to go.<eos> Voilá. What, honey?<eos> I can't find my tiger!<eos> Where'd you put it?
He said he got me ready.<eos> Ready for what?<eos> I don't know, but he said it's my time.<eos> What do you mean it's...<eos> Wyatt?<eos> Come on, hon, the tub's ready!<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> Tub's ready.<eos> Come on. You can bring your movie.<eos> Just put it over there.
Come on, hon, the tub's ready!<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> Tub's ready.<eos> Come on. You can bring your movie.<eos> Just put it over there.<eos> You want bubbles?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, Mr. Bubble!<eos> Honey, what did I say? You're gonna get your computer wet.<eos> Put it back here.
I've been having dreams, uh... visions I guess you would call them.<eos> Visions?<eos> Yeah, reliving things.<eos> Why didn't you speak about the attack back when you were in group?<eos> David's death seemed more important at the time.<eos> Right.<eos> Imagining things, uh, reliving trauma-- that's all expected if you haven't dealt with the event.<eos> You add to that the stress from your work, it's hardly a surprise that you're not sleeping.<eos> Maybe... this isn't the best time to be trying this case.<eos> Maybe you should drop it.
Just a number?<eos> There was an exclamation point after it.<eos> Yeah, well, it's good to use punctuation too.<eos> Once I'm logged in, I can search and destroy all of the files I want.<eos> Crap!<eos> What?<eos> I can't connect.<eos> Well, don't you have your hot thing?<eos> Spot. Yeah, but the problem is on the other end.<eos> Either they haven't even tried to mess with my computer yet, or they're smart enough to keep it off line.
Kimball Cho, CBI.<eos> I want to talk about Junior Porchetto.<eos> Did you and he have a fight on the 17th?<eos> No, we did not.<eos> Well, according to the incident report, you got into an argument with Junior, and he had three of his guys beat you to a pulp.<eos> Nope.<eos> Well, how'd all this happen?<eos> A boating accident.<eos> Now Junior did this to you.<eos> Now you must have a major grudge, and we can talk about it here, or I can take you in, you can sit in a cell and talk about it tomorrow.
A glass of water will suffice, thank you.<eos> My manners are Pictish today.<eos> This is a certified copy of Rosa's father's will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Back to London as soon as I can.<eos> I am an awkward species of a man, with no experience of such delights, but I figure to myself, subject to your correction, Mr Edwin, that the true lover is ever impatient to be close to the object of his affections, seeking her company as a bird seeks its nest.<eos> I do write to her in between visits.<eos> You will notice from your perusal of Rosa's father's will, a kindly allusion to a little trust, confided to me in conversation, to discharge at such time as I in my discretion may think best.<eos> This ring was removed from the dead hand of Rosa's mother, in my presence.<eos> Your placing it on her daughter's finger... will be the most solemn seal upon your love.
Commander!<eos> That's not right!<eos> That's all there is.<eos> We'll starve if we keep going.<eos> There are people going hungry and you're feeding a cat?<eos> I'm giving her my share.<eos> I just won't eat later, all right?<eos> You're eating for two, you can have more later.<eos> Master Fan, the donkey has the runs.<eos> Should I feed it?
Hey, look.<eos> A foreigner.<eos> Come here.<eos> Hungry?<eos> Quiet!<eos> Xialu , you get his donkey.<eos> Shuanzhu, you keep an eye on him.<eos> Don't wake him up.<eos> Shhhh!<eos> Where should I take it?
You go that way.<eos> I'll go this way.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> You killed my donkey?<eos> Fuck off!<eos> Your donkey?<eos> You're just a refugee.<eos> If you had a donkey, your eyes wouldn't be caving in.<eos> If you're going to keep it, at least give me a piece of meat!
What about Obama?<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Hi. I've been trying to call you since yesterday.<eos> Yeah, my phone's broken.<eos> Listen, I'm sorry to just come over but I left my laptop here.<eos> Oh, man, okay.<eos> Can I get it?
that one had to be 20 feet long.<eos> You told me the biggest one was six feet, maybe seven feet at the most.<eos> Listen, lady, the first time I saw that thing is when it tried to bite our asses off.<eos> It's your job to keep tabs on them.<eos> It's a big damn lake.<eos> None of my people saw anything that big while building the fence.<eos> What? Your boyfriend gets a pass but I don't?<eos> Max, wait by my truck.<eos> If I can stick my head into this lovely argument for a second-- let me guess.<eos> The Godzilla wannabe up there is even more miraculous and life affirming than the rest of them, and we can't kill it either.
Or not.<eos> It was okay.<eos> Either way.<eos> Is this quiche?<eos> It's store-bought.<eos> Fucking Cruz. It's gonna turn around and bite him in the ass.<eos> Stay out of it, Jackie.<eos> Sorry, it's just hard.<eos> I know you did what you did so I could keep my job.<eos> And now I expect you to make sure you keep it.
(MOANING) What's wrong?<eos> Are you in labor?<eos> No, I just need a moment to myself.<eos> Me, too.<eos> It's horrible out there.<eos> Oh, yep.<eos> Ekebwe and Cruz got it covered.<eos> Oh. You know, you haven't told me the name of the baby.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm worried that if I do and you love it, then I shall start to hate it.
Sanders, guard the fort.<eos> - Don't tell me you fucked this up.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> All you had to do was push a goddamn button.<eos> Sounds like something snapped.<eos> Is that your professional opinion or just a wild fucking guess?<eos> Shit, I'm gonna die of old age in this motherfucker.<eos> Get the truck, pull it out.<eos> We need to take a look. Pull it out.<eos> Kill it.
You beat up one of my guys, I beat up one of yours.<eos> You take a finger, I'm gonna take an arm.<eos> In the end, nobody wins.<eos> Well, we don't negotiate with thieving scoundrels.<eos> Enough with the drama.<eos> I got screwed, too.<eos> I didn't know it was stolen.<eos> I got a suggestion.<eos> You give me the booze,<eos> I'll collect the money from the guy who sold it.
Only...<eos> If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.<eos> Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.<eos> My name is Harry Percy.<eos> Why, then I see a very valiant rebel of a name.<eos> I am the Prince of Wales and think not, Percy, to share with me in glory any more.<eos> Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere.<eos> Well said, Hal.<eos> The hour is come to end the one of us, and would to God thy name in arms were now as great as mine.<eos> I'll make it greater ere I part from thee, and all the budding honours on thy crest I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.
He heard of your grace's coming to town, there's a letter for you.<eos> I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog, for look you how he writes.<eos> "Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of the king,<eos> "nearest his father, Harry Prince of Wales, greeting." Why, this is a certificate.<eos> Peace!<eos> "I will imitate... Oh, I will imitate to the honourable Romans in brevity.<eos> "Be not too familiar with Poins.<eos> "He misuses thy favours so much, "that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell.<eos> "Repent at idle times as thou mayest, and so, farewell."<eos> My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.
But...<eos> I also have these.<eos> There's the two of you kissing over dinner.<eos> Busting a move in a night club.<eos> Is that your hand near her nether regions?<eos> Thanks again for taking off the ankle bracelet.<eos> I'm not gonna let you blackmail me, House.<eos> Oh, of course not.<eos> There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip.<eos> But what about compromising it in a minor way?
We're in the middle of something.<eos> I know.<eos> I came to speak with Dr. House.<eos> And when they told me he was in here, I thought I should say something.<eos> I mean...<eos> He wasn't the nicest doctor I've ever met.<eos> Well, I think we've heard enough.<eos> But he was right.<eos> They found the tumor.<eos> They are removing it, and they are starting plasmapheresis.
Yeah, House is doing this because of his great love of structure, not because he wants us to turn on each other.<eos> So, don't do that.<eos> It makes sense to have someone in there with a little more accountability.<eos> As long as it's not Adams.<eos> She sees the whole thing as an opportunity to remake the department in her image.<eos> Or Park, for obvious reasons.<eos> And Taub's got the kids.<eos> Are you seriously angling for a job that you mocked as fake the whole time I had it?<eos> I don't want the job.<eos> You just don't want anyone else to have it.
You changed our counter to Leading Lights?<eos> You deserve proper billing and a salary bump in the second term.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> We decided it wasn't worth potentially blowing the deal.<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> I've got to get some work done.<eos> These are such pretty flowers you buy for me. Every Friday from Japanese florist, on corner of Edison and Conway.<eos> There's just one more thing.<eos> With this ring, I thee wedded.<eos> You left it here when you skipped town with your boyfriend.
Good news, based on her thrifty shopping habits and taste for artificial dairy, she's clearly not a gold digger.<eos> Bad news:<eos> Based on his rhinotillexomania, he is.<eos> Compulsive addiction to nose-picking.<eos> A small cut on the inside of the left nostril led to an infection in the cavernous sinus.<eos> It was very nice meeting you, Mel.<eos> It's not true.<eos> Gloria, wait, I can change.<eos> My PPTH contract.<eos> House signed it six months ago.
Start the treatment.<eos> Miserable yet?<eos> He's polite, well-adjusted, and a straight-A student.<eos> Which means he doesn't need you.<eos> So why don't you get out while the butterfly effect is still in the cocoon stage?<eos> I'm making him dinner.<eos> You don't make an 11-year-old dinner.<eos> You give him a jar of peanut butter.<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> I could give this kid a quinoa salad, and he would eat it just to be nice.
Right.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You want...<eos> peanut butter?<eos> Do you have prosciutto?<eos> You like prosciutto?<eos> I'm weird.<eos> No, no.<eos> I-- I like it too.
And... you two are gonna help me find that guy.<eos> Ohh, fine.<eos> You win.<eos> You always do, because you're so... feisty.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Aah! Oh, my god!<eos> Why are you still here?<eos> ! Didn't the alarm go off?<eos> Yeah, 4 o'clock in the morning.<eos> I shut it off.
I can't do this.<eos> What?<eos> Just forget I said anything, okay?<eos> Forget you asked me to marry you?<eos> What?<eos> Give me the ring.<eos> You don't wanna marry me, Renee.<eos> I'm an awful person.<eos> You're an amazing person.<eos> Now slide it on right there.
Get the line over there.<eos> The entire universe depends on everything fitting together just right.<eos> If you can fix the broken piece, everything can go right back.<eos> Come on, baby!<eos> Peter T hand me that trip wire.<eos> I'm so sorry, but....<eos> Peter T, you drop the trip wire?<eos> Well, yes, I did.<eos> - Peter T.<eos> - I gotta go find it.
Let's go.<eos> Dispatch, we need a, uh, coroner at...<eos> Rest in peace!<eos> All right, let's get these coins into evidence.<eos> Hey, don't worry.<eos> I got it. But first, I'm gonna break that guy.<eos> I just got the prelim on the jewelry store.<eos> I want you guys to fill me in in my office.<eos> That's when we got the call on the car.<eos> We ran it down and came on the house they were using as a hideout.
Should I tell George?<eos> That poor, sweet man is planning their wedding.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't tell anyone anything, okay?<eos> I'm sure that there's a logical explanation for this.<eos> I'm gonna find out what it is.<eos> Look, I'd be perfectly willing to write the grant proposal myself but time is running out.<eos> Okay.<eos> So we'll call an emergency session of the town council...<eos> - ... and have it approved.
I know I've never heard it.<eos> - Hey, Norbert.<eos> Hey, doc.<eos> Hey.<eos> Listen.<eos> Whoa, whoa. Heh.<eos> - Well, listen, I have this, uh, vintage veil.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> Is that the right word, veil?<eos> Anyway, it belonged to my mother and I wanna give it to Magnolia who's getting married tomorrow.
Now, for starters, my lovely niece Wanda is gonna be joining our staff as the new barback.<eos> Woo-hoo!<eos> Wanda!<eos> I'll also be bringing in a pool table for the back.<eos> And I'm adding a new signature cocktail to our menu.<eos> Uh, we don't have any signature cocktails on the menu.<eos> Which might be why we never make Esquire's list of Top 100 Bars in America.<eos> And to turn up the heat, we're gonna make it a contest.<eos> Shelley versus Wade.<eos> Whoever comes up with the best signature cocktail gets to name it.
I still can't believe that Zoe made that call.<eos> I mean I don't know how we're ever gonna be able to repay her.<eos> Well, I mean she called her father. It's not like she called the president.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Zoe calling her father is- Is just about the same as you calling your mother.<eos> So it is a huge deal.<eos> - I'm sorry. I had no idea, George.<eos> - I know you didn't.<eos> You know what, Lemon?<eos> Just, from now on just keep all that nonsense to yourself because I don't wanna hear it anymore.
You being stuck here is the only bad part of that scenario?<eos> What about whipped cream?<eos> Yeah, but where am I gonna get whipped cream?<eos> Um, in my overnight bag.<eos> Why in the world you got whipped cream in your-?<eos> Oh.<eos> Thank you so much for all you did for me today, Magnolia.<eos> Getting me these chocolates and the pizzas and all these stuffed animals.<eos> - And my favorite pink sweater.<eos> - Love it.
Sleep too long, and the whistling starts.<eos> I'm already in starvation response.<eos> They say at some point, the hunger subsides.<eos> I keep waiting for that.<eos> Mangos.<eos> There's a tree full of mango.<eos> No! No!<eos> Uhh!<eos> Well, the ankle's broken.<eos> I just can't put any weight on it.
Those drugs weren't mine.<eos> You tested me.<eos> Why don't you believe me?<eos> I just did my job, Terrence.<eos> Those drugs were in your place, that makes them yours.<eos> You should have been more careful.<eos> Thank you for calling DFS, how can I assist you?<eos> Pastrami from Zabar's? You must need something big.<eos> Terrence King's blood test.<eos> His parole officer did one and I need it to help me prove he wasn't using.
Daddy! TERRENCE:<eos> There he is. [LAUGHS]<eos> Chris did me a big favor by picking him up from the foster family's place.<eos> When are you coming home, Daddy?<eos> I don't like my room.<eos> Andrea's gonna get me out sooner than you know. ANDREA:<eos> That's right, buddy.<eos> Jacob, go over and, uh, hang with Chris for a minute, let me finish talking to Andrea.<eos> So, um... - You get the blood test?<eos> - Chris is working on it. - But even if we get it...
We need to make sure Galuska doesn't have more killers looking for Andrea.<eos> - What did I do? REESE:<eos> Galuska's getting money to set up his ex-cons and send them to prison.<eos> You kicked a hornet's nest with Terrence's case.<eos> Galuska may have planted those drugs in his home.<eos> Oh, my God, that means Terrence is actually innocent.<eos> - You weren't sure?<eos> - I wanted to be.<eos> Terrence was given a drug test the night he was arrested. It came back negative.<eos> Galuska and the Department of Corrections conveniently misplaced it.
At request of the praetor.<eos> He blesses Ashur with well deserved favor.<eos> Would that he turn such grace toward grieving wife.<eos> It is a hard thing, to have a father torn from breast.<eos> I never knew mine...<eos> How did Glaber come to know of the silphium in Ilithyia's chambers?<eos> Perhaps the gods spoke to him.<eos> You forget your place.<eos> No.<eos> I secure it.
Let it drop, and fall forever beside it!<eos> Again!<eos> I would not have you expire from the heat.<eos> Gratitude.<eos> I would also not have you at Agron's throat.<eos> If he had his way, he would have left you in the mines.<eos> Perhaps he was right.<eos> Do not say such a thing.<eos> You have not thought the same, after last night?<eos> If such a thought threatened, I would rip it from fucking brain with bare hands.
But let it gently slip from your fingers.<eos> With practice, you will be as the goddess Diana, striking enemies from afar.<eos> Donar!<eos> I would accompany you.<eos> I hold no interest in the bow.<eos> We lay together once and you expect us to never be parted?<eos> You mistake me for a fucking Gaul.<eos> You seek Donar's affection now?<eos> I seek only my place in this world.<eos> Then seize it with your own hands.
He too was a Roman.<eos> Yet marched upon his own people.<eos> Punishing any who dared to defy him.<eos> Your eyes seemed to brighten, when you heard my name.<eos> Unexpected from a Roman.<eos> The ones I held to heart were slaughtered by the same.<eos> They stand no kin to me now.<eos> And yet the man who would make them suffer,<eos> You could not have made speech before swilling the last of the wine?<eos> Had I known you were for this temple, I'd have stocked it to the fucking rafters.
Survivors?<eos> Give names.<eos> I know only that three stand for the sands .... and one by word marked as the Undefeated Gaul.<eos> Crixus?<eos> He yet lives?<eos> Only to see sun break dawn once more.<eos> The games come to an end when it sets.<eos> As do the lives of your men.<eos> Spartacus yet evades death.<eos> While we fucking embrace it.
Ilithyia?<eos> The gods have heard my prayers.<eos> To return you to my arms...<eos> You alone offer such embrace.<eos> I have not taken food nor rest since you were torn from them.<eos> Nor would I have, until I had followed you to suspected fate.<eos> Would that all held me as close to heart.<eos> Well, you're the reason that mine still beats.<eos> You and the blessing you carry.<eos> I have never considered it as such.
Give voice to your desire.<eos> See it considered.<eos> Nemetes!<eos> You attack before command is given!<eos> You must remain hidden until the Romans are drawn in.<eos> You would see them breach the wall?<eos> We would see them trapped, you simple fuck.<eos> Like fish in a net.<eos> A wagon approaches.<eos> Agron leads it.
Ill winds has blown Capua from once steady course.<eos> Take further matter to Praetor Glaber.<eos> Perhaps you can entice coin from him as well, if caught upon proper mood.<eos> ...and misfortune.<eos> We have all suffered loss of those closest to us.<eos> Even a senator of our great Republic, a man my wife called father, has been ripped from this world by Spartacus and his mongrel hordes.<eos> And now beloved Seppius has fallen to this festering disease of rebellion.<eos> Murdered by his own slaves, who even now spirited themselves away to join Spartacus against us.<eos> We must be ever vigilant in these dark times.<eos> We must bring to light even dimmest shadow of betrayal if it is revealed to us.
And that certainly was your intention.<eos> How do I look?<eos> Like a criminal.<eos> Should buy you all the credibility you need in prison.<eos> Look, I don't know what you guys are up to, but...<eos> Do we have enough recording?<eos> I believe so.<eos> Which means you can go to sleep now.<eos> So how does this vocal emulator work?<eos> Well, you swallow it.
If I can time it right, I can climb up to that exit shaft.<eos> -Just follow me and time your jump.<eos> -Go!<eos> (GRUNTING)<eos> Get moving!<eos> Hardeen has done it again.<eos> I'm beginning to think he may be the best one to lead this operation.<eos> Hardeen is crafty, I will grant you, but let's see what happens when he is not the key to their survival.<eos> To reach your final challenge, you must pass through my ray shield.<eos> The switch to turn it off is on the other side.
You don't have to.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Just pack your suitcase. Wait for me at midnight at the place I told you.<eos> You said we'd go together.<eos> I have to go to some places.<eos> We'll meet there.<eos> I don't know how, how to tell you my sorrow<eos> A sorrow that's heart-scorching<eos> A sorrow you'd wish upon your enemy<eos> If I were to name it heartbreak... it is not
I have to go.<eos> Just pack your suitcase. Wait for me at midnight at the place I told you.<eos> You said we'd go together.<eos> I have to go to some places.<eos> We'll meet there.<eos> I don't know how, how to tell you my sorrow<eos> A sorrow that's heart-scorching<eos> A sorrow you'd wish upon your enemy<eos> If I were to name it heartbreak... it is not<eos> If I were to call it daily struggle... it is not
The general gave us orders.<eos> Artillery! Oh, shock. Or like a staff, if I shaved it down far enough.<eos> You're being too loud!<eos> I've got big plans for this stick.<eos> Keep the stick. I don't care.<eos> Just follow me.<eos> Could turn it into a trigger for a bomb or something, I dunno.<eos> Maybe a booby trap.<eos> I'm in love with this stick.<eos> Do you like it?
It's my fault.<eos> Why?<eos> What did you do?<eos> Dexter's allergic to dogs, sweetie.<eos> That's why we can't have them.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What were you going to tell her?<eos> - The truth.<eos> - What is the truth?<eos> That you got rid of the dog 'cause you thought I might kill it. But I wouldn't.
She'd see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time.<eos> She knows my koala face.<eos> And for future reference, it's this.<eos> Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.<eos> Yeah. I started when I was a teenager.<eos> I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act. Did it work?<eos> Ah, let's just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one.<eos> Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.<eos> I like the fabric.<eos> Where'd she get it?
Hand me those rings?<eos> See?<eos> You nailed it.<eos> You know, i-it's just that I'm not that comfortable with little kids.<eos> Well, that's because you haven't been around them much.<eos> This is good practice.<eos> I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right? Mmm...<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I haven't seen this trick in years.<eos> It's called the dove pan.
I'm sorry I didn't remember sooner.<eos> That's all right.<eos> It happens a lot.<eos> We were married for so long that it's hard for people to remember me without him.<eos> Mrs. Zimberg, are you sure you want to go through with this surgery?<eos> Honey, how old are you?<eos> 35?<eos> - Oh, you're sweet.<eos> - Well, I'm not 35.<eos> And I tell you, if I have cancer, I have no intention of treating it.
But this is the true story of my mother.<eos> The man that Mother loved was a wolf man.<eos> Mother was a student at a university just outside of Tokyo.<eos> - Her tuition was paid for with scholarships - This is what Socrates said: - and she worked a part-time job to cover living expenses.<eos> - In the textbook, it says "The wise men of the world may have great knowledge of many things... but goodness, truth, beauty, and arete..."<eos> One day in early summer, Mother saw Father for the first time at the university.<eos> Wearing a shirt with a stretched-out collar, using no textbook... Mother said he was completely different from the other students as she watched him from behind earnestly taking notes.<eos> Please wait.<eos> This is the attendance sheet.<eos> If you don't turn it in, you'll be marked absent.
Will you at least tell her we love her and we're here for her?<eos> I'll be sure to relay the message.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Who were you, uh, talking to?<eos> Just the men installing my ramp.<eos> Now how about I make us some lunch?<eos> No, you've gotta deliver that cement tomorrow.<eos> Look, I don't know why Ben didn't pay you, but I drove back to the site.<eos> I'm gonna find your check, and I'll get it to you tonight.
I think she was eager to get back to school.<eos> I was sort of hoping she'd change her mind and come back with you.<eos> "Guess what, mom?<eos> I decided to stay."<eos> Well, give her some time.<eos> You never know.<eos> I think I know.<eos> Porter? Is everything okay?<eos> Everything pretty much sucks.<eos> I thought I had a job, but my mom says it's not good enough.
So what are you gonna do with all this time to yourself?<eos> Oh, that is a problem I look forward to solving.<eos> Bye, Paige.<eos> Thank you!<eos> I spoke with your doctor, and I know.<eos> What?<eos> Doctors aren't allowed to talk about patients' conditions.<eos> Well, they can if you're family, mom.<eos> Why didn't you tell anyone the cancer's back?<eos> Because this time, I ain't gonna beat it.
There, I said it.<eos> Oh, what you must think of me.<eos> A "Mess" means you haven't fluffed the sofa pillows today.<eos> Now come on.<eos> Oh, hell's bells.<eos> - I seem to have forgotten my key.<eos> - Sometimes I think I'd forget my head if it weren't attached to my body.<eos> Of course, then I wouldn't need to get my hat.<eos> The manager has a master key.<eos> Would you mind running down to the office to get it?
Let me break it to them.<eos> I'd appreciate that.<eos> You know what I've noticed about you?<eos> What?<eos> You're the most self-effacing doctor I've ever met.<eos> You make everyone feel as if they know more than you.<eos> Blessing and a curse. Double-edged sword.<eos> Sharp. (PHONE BUZZING)<eos> We got a jumper.<eos> You want it?
Most people are pretty good about it.<eos> I wasn't here to see you.<eos> It was the same building; I serve this district.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Well, I... I misunderstood.<eos> It was very nice to see you again.<eos> Very nice to see you.<eos> What happened?<eos> We can't find the rider.<eos> I filed it, but we can't find it.
Yes. In the active drawer.<eos> And you made the photocopy or did a paralegal? I did.<eos> And I personally filed it in the archive.<eos> And the rider was separate?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Do you remember having to attach the rider to the contract?<eos> No.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Do you remember signing the rider, also?<eos> You had to sign it to act as a witness to her signature.
There wasn't?<eos> No, so I could trace it to the computer where the embedding was done.<eos> Great. What was it?<eos> It's your computer.<eos> You did not embed the "Stack is innocent" code on the new Bitcoins, Ms. Sharma?<eos> I'll be answering for her.<eos> No.<eos> And yet we traced the embedding to your computer.<eos> Ms. Sharma has nothing to do with it.<eos> And I would like to bring the Treasury's attention to a common computer hacking practice called ghosting, in which the hacker only needs access to a parasite computer to get it to do his or her will. In other words,
Honestly, Gramps, it's nothing.<eos> Just because your father isn't here doesn't mean... that the rules have changed.<eos> Everything has been fair game at the Reagan family dinner table.<eos> Always has been.<eos> Always will be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... what's going on?<eos> Well, Linda wants me to drop the case.<eos> I didn't ask you to drop the case.<eos> I asked you to hand it off.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, great, know what?<eos> Leave it with me, I'll take care of it.<eos> All right?<eos> Hey!<eos> You stay right there, all right?<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing, Reagan?<eos> I said don't move.<eos> Get the hell out of my trash.<eos> You leave trash out on the curb, and it can be searched without a warrant,
You punch him back?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, why'd they punch you?<eos> I was in the boys' bathroom and Marcus came in and started bothering me.<eos> What'd he do?<eos> He tried to look at my... You know.<eos> He tried to look at your dick?<eos> He didn't see it. But he told everyone I had a small one.
- Rodney! - Damn it, woman!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Marty! You missed the boobs. Eh.<eos> They'll be back.<eos> Oh, hey, I came up with a new character... Carnival Sin.<eos> I came up with him during math class.<eos> Cool. I like it.<eos> Your strap's kind of in the way.<eos> Then take it off.
Cool. I like it.<eos> Your strap's kind of in the way.<eos> Then take it off.<eos> Anything happen at school today?<eos> Not really.<eos> Marcus wasn't even there.<eos> I have another movie we can watch after this.<eos> What is it?<eos> Headless.<eos> My brother stole it from the video store.

Go down upon him.<eos> You have power enough.<eos> Bring him our prisoner.<eos> This becomes the great.<eos> Now forth, Lord Constable, and princes all, and quickly bring us word of England's fall.<eos> My lord.<eos> You know me by my habit.<eos> What shall I know of thee?<eos> My master's mind.<eos> Unfold it.
Montjoy.<eos> Thou dost thy office fairly.<eos> Turn thee back. And tell thy king I do not seek him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without impeachment.<eos> For, to say the sooth, my people are with sickness much enfeebled, my numbers lessened, and those few I have almost no better than so many French, who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,<eos> I thought upon one pair of English legs did march three Frenchmen.<eos> Go, therefore, tell thy master, here I am.<eos> If we may pass, we will. If we be hinder'd... we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolour.<eos> And so... Montjoy... fare you well.<eos> The sum of all our answer is but this.<eos> We would not seek a battle, as we are. Nor, as we are... we say we will not shun it.
And please your majesty, let his neck answer for it. If there be any martial law in the world.<eos> How canst thou make me satisfaction?<eos> All offences, my lord, come from the heart. Never came any from mine that might offend your majesty.<eos> It was ourself thou didst abuse.<eos> Your majesty came not like yourself.<eos> You appeared to me but as a common man. Witness the night, your garments, your lowliness.<eos> And what your highness suffered under that shape, I beseech you, take it for your own fault and not mine.<eos> For had you been as I took you for, I made no offence.<eos> Therefore, I beseech your highness, pardon me.<eos> Here, Captain, fill this glove with crowns and give it to this fellow.

Aurora grew in me as an absolute reality.<eos> March<eos> My growing discomfort reached its climax at a party in the pool house.<eos> Maybe the lugubrious aura of this place stressed my restlessness.<eos> The parties there owed their reputation to the strange family that lived there.<eos> The lady had run away, leaving son and husband in charge of each other.<eos> The son had been born with feeble nerves, and later returned even more perturbed after a long stay in Marseille, where he got involved with the underworld and specialized in French boxing.<eos> In panic situations he would take flight into another reality and, just like Don Quixote, he'd fight invisible enemies.<eos> The father hid a feral despair under a polished cloak of amiability.<eos> On New Year's Eve, after a bottle of whiskey he'd close the living room door, load a bullet into the drum of a gun, raise it to his temple and challenge life.
Yeah! I'm buying my man a lap dance, 'cause that's just how I do!<eos> Party like a rock star!<eos> Party like a rock star...<eos> Uh, hey, guys. It's Ted.<eos> Um... you're probably busy with the move still. Um...<eos> Give me a call if you want to gab.<eos> Sorry about using the word "gab."<eos> Ted, stop pining over Marshall and Lily.<eos> Have some self-respect.<eos> Now, put this fiver in your mouth so... that stripper with the lazy eye can vacuum it up with...
Yes!<eos> Finally!<eos> By the way, did you see how she opened that bottle?<eos> Lights out in the suburbs is... is really dark.<eos> Where's the fuse box? I don't know.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> Maybe I could fix it for you, if I wasn't so busy packing.<eos> You know what?<eos> I bet the fuse box is in the basement.<eos> I'll just... I'll go find it myself.
But I'm more than the mother of a murdered daughter.<eos> I'm Cathy, age 42, and I have a son, Laurent, whom I love, and he needs me.<eos> What would Eva want?<eos> Do you want to think about it?<eos> No need.<eos> You seem honest.<eos> It'll be great for touring the countryside.<eos> - Thanks. Here.<eos> - Want to keep the key chain?<eos> - You can have it.
Plus, I'd like to give it to her myself.<eos> Look, I'm really sorry, but I can't help you.<eos> Wish she'd tell me where that girl lives.<eos> Maybe I should lock her in the boot of a car.<eos> Have you got a car?<eos> Jess has got a car.<eos> A hatchback.<eos> I don't think she'd fit.<eos> Well, what about the laptop?<eos> Yes. Good - steal the laptop, find the address, sell it on.
This better be good.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> I know who's got your cock.<eos> Apparently, she just turned up one night with a cock.<eos> No surgery, nothing.<eos> What's her name?<eos> She calls herself James.<eos> She hangs around in the karaoke bar on the estate.<eos> There's half.<eos> You get the rest when I get it back.
I went to your flat, I know what's going on.<eos> Dude, I'm sorry about the dick-tuck thing.<eos> It was fucking insensitive.<eos> Where is she?<eos> This is a song very close to my heart.<eos> I hope you'll like it, too.<eos> Is that the probation worker?<eos> I want my fucking cock. Fuck off!<eos> Get off me!<eos> That night at the club, you took it from me and I want it back.

I am, man, I'm in love with a nun!<eos> Which is always going to end up badly.<eos> Oi... no!<eos> Why do you have to say something like that?<eos> What about you, sweetcheeks?<eos> I'm still looking for some kind of emotional connection.<eos> I'm starting to think I'm never going to find it.<eos> Which makes me feel sad and... lost and strangely horny, like I want to fuck away the pain.<eos> You take the pain... and you hang onto it.<eos> You bury it!

Cos that's it.<eos> Feels like your guts are strangling your heart.<eos> Lap it up.<eos> It's good for the soul.<eos> Why are you looking at him like that?<eos> Or reattached.<eos> I'm talkin' about his cock.<eos> Why are you all so obsessed with his cock?<eos> I wouldn't say I'm obsessed.<eos> If you're really that into it, why don't you go over there and ask him to show it to you?
I will bid you goodnight.<eos> Little cherub one of yours, ain't he, Jack?<eos> What happened?<eos> I've been shot, sir.<eos> Don't turn it into a three act play.<eos> It's only a graze.<eos> What's this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But he... he wouldn't have meant no harm by it.<eos> He'd just come back to find his stash, and he found it, just where he hid it.
He was sweet on her.<eos> Derek wasn't sweet on Kitty.<eos> He just couldn't resist the other thing.<eos> You know, down there.<eos> And what would you know?<eos> She was trying to trap him because she was in strife.<eos> I saw her out the back heaving her guts out and I picked it right off.<eos> She was in the family way.<eos> I gave that badge to Marie.<eos> Maybe Kitty took it because she was jealous.
You don't have to fire me.<eos> Tell me you weren't stalking Ray Speltzer.<eos> I was at the cemetery where he works as a groundskeeper.<eos> Goddamn it, Dexter.<eos> He was lingering inside a mausoleum, treating it like it was sacred ground.<eos> I think he's hiding something in there...<eos> - ...something that may prove his guilt.<eos> - "I think he may." That's not evidence.<eos> I'd already have the evidence if you hadn't ordered me back here.<eos> But even without it, I can tell Speltzer's gonna kill again.
What are you talking about?<eos> Uh, the uh-- the billboard,<eos> The thing he did... Was for me. It was a birthday present.<eos> I thought he gave you a scarf.<eos> I mean, that was the first part.<eos> I better get baking.<eos> It's good to see you both.<eos> It's been a long time since you negotiated One of John's contracts.<eos> I should have brought that mitt you said you'd sign.<eos> Bring it by any time, pal.
That's whack.<eos> You wanna go another round, flaca?<eos> I just want my watch back if you haven't pawned it already.<eos> Simone, stop.<eos> Monica, if you just let us finish we'll get out of here and you'll never have to see Simone again.<eos> Simone?<eos> even her name's fancy.<eos> And don't get like that just because you live in Mission Hills now, right?<eos> I'm the same Daphne I was before. my name is still Vasquez.<eos> Till you change it to something white.
- Yes, I can.<eos> What makes you think that she's going to let you?<eos> I'm going to give her double the value for her shares.<eos> And it'll be worth it to give her one less reason to visit us.<eos> Hey, she is my mother.<eos> Yeah, and Bay is our daughter.<eos> And if your mother does not have the decency to give our daughter some consideration then I don't feel like I have to give her any either.<eos> And I'm giving her the check tomorrow morning Right before she leaves.<eos> - You know what? - Hmm?<eos> Let me give it to her.
Not at all.<eos> One sec.<eos> Hi.<eos> I just wanted to introduce myself and my roommate, Max.<eos> There, and give you these cupcakes.<eos> That is so nice.<eos> Well, it's the leash... least...<eos> least I can do.<eos> Well, I gotta go.<eos> Well, if we ever get a dog, we know who can walk it.
Take your time, Ms. Lockhart.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> And didn't you explain this switch to your associates as being due to the fact that Mr. Gardner had a better relationship with Judge Parks?<eos> Yes.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Will, do you have a moment?<eos> Why did we win the McDermott case?<eos> They asked you about the McDermott case?<eos> They asked me almost exclusively about the McDermott case.<eos> Why did we win it?
Damon Pope's daughter.<eos> The most dangerous gangster in the whole town.<eos> Tig's in trouble, brother.<eos> He needs an escort home.<eos> It's time we all knew the truth-<eos> - Clay Morrow killed your father.<eos> Stole that seat away from this family, and he tried to kill your wife.<eos> You kill Clay before he's on his feet and strikes first.<eos> When Clay's back at the table, we can discuss the deal.<eos> The only way this deal happens is if he's running it.

I don't know what to say to them.<eos> I respectfully suggest you make something up...<eos> Sir.<eos> Gather around.<eos> So, Charleston was a bust.<eos> We thought we were gonna have paradise on Earth delivered to us right here on a silver platter.<eos> We should have known better.<eos> I should have known better.<eos> It doesn't mean that the dream was bad.<eos> It just means that we are gonna have to work harder to make it happen.
That's a hard call.<eos> Do I really want to put him through all the crap of a series of interventions, cracking his ribs, filling his body with drugs, every indignity, when he's just gonna die anyway?<eos> Charlie's not gonna die.<eos> Come on, Joel, he is.<eos> He has some brain function maybe, but the rest is just machines.<eos> No, you don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do and so do you.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I mean, look at Shawn price.<eos> You know, I can either cut that kid's arm off or I can try and save it, so I don't know, why don't I try the option of... Thinking you're not screwed?
An actor who didn't behave well during the occupation.<eos> Le Vigan!<eos> Now I remember.<eos> Paul Vigan, the friend, neighbor, and colleague of Lieport.<eos> They always took care of his daughter when needed.<eos> I really saw Roland on the boat.<eos> It wasn't a dream, it was him.<eos> But he was already dead.<eos> I was stunned, or I would have understood.<eos> Vigan raised the body to the trapdoor by holding it from behind like a puppet.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Saving your life. Get down.<eos> Okay, go!<eos> Let her go.<eos> - You won't do it.<eos> - No, you're right.<eos> No.<eos> This is Amanda.<eos> Don't bother tracking the dead-man's switch.<eos> We're jamming it now.
I think he was attacked by that dog.<eos> He was at the motel in Soo-sak area.<eos> He was going to the parking lot when he was attacked.<eos> I'll report you with more details once I find some witnesses.<eos> Kang is in custody.<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm sorry, sir. I'll catch it as soon as possible.<eos> Shit!<eos> It's just one damn dog.<eos> Why did you let it loose?
Watch the point number 5.<eos> Watch the back area.<eos> - Team 3. - Sir!<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Team 3 and team 4.<eos> Watch the front entrance.<eos> Team 2. Watch the street in front.<eos> This dog is a killer dog.<eos> We must catch it.
Deep breaths.<eos> Vivia.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> No dizziness?<eos> I'm OK.<eos> Did I sleep?<eos> In a way.<eos> Roxana, does the name Vivia mean anything to you?<eos> No. Why?<eos> You've said it a few times.
Nevertheless, the letter must have held a terrible secret.<eos> What do you it could be?<eos> For a eunuch in the forbidden city, one can never guess what he could hear or see.<eos> Dinh Thang and Dinh Phuc used to be in charge of recording the list of name and time of concubines summoned by the former King.<eos> When the Queen Dowager gave birth to Ban Co, they might have realised something suspicious.<eos> Your Highness, have you ever thought that the Queen Dowager was the real mastermind behind the former King's murder in order to conceal her crime?<eos> This is also what I'm wondering about.<eos> But without any real evidence, it can only remain as a possibility.<eos> Then perhaps the blood letter is the final piece to this puzzle.<eos> If it does really exist, it's really a godsend to your cause.
Nguyen Vu, you're still very naive.<eos> You think that I'd silently do my best for somebody else's interest?<eos> No, the throne is mine.<eos> It's rightfully mine!<eos> And you have my thank for helping me realise it.<eos> I'll never be on your side!<eos> Hand me back the letter!<eos> I originally thought that we could be good friends.<eos> It's really a shame.<eos> Here, take it!
What do you want me to do?<eos> Who is that?<eos> Your highness, a stranger wishes your audience.<eos> He said that he had the letter.<eos> Kneel!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Who are you?<eos> - That's not important .<eos> How did you have the letter?<eos> - Such details aren't more important than the fact it's already in my hand.
Look, Maurella, you seem like a lovely person.<eos> Mmm, I am.<eos> - And I know that we have--<eos> - Twice.<eos> But I'm not stupid.<eos> A lot of people might think I'm stupid, but those people are wrong.<eos> No, I don't think you're stupid.<eos> Well, apparently you do if you think you can pull this over on me.<eos> Did you or did you not swear upon the light?<eos> All I know is your finger lit up and I touched it.
And it doesn't matter how many people get hurt or killed.<eos> One of the worst things about being immortal is having to watch the same stupid scenario happen over and over.<eos> It's usually the humans, though.<eos> Guess this proves we're just as fucking retarded as they are.<eos> I still can't believe Eric and Bill weren't even gonna warn Sookie Russell Edgington was coming after her.<eos> Must all roads lead to fucking Sookie?<eos> They were just gonna let him drain her, all because according to their vampire Bible, she's an abomination.<eos> Maybe there's something to this religion after all.<eos> It took both of us to take that buck down this morning.<eos> Sure would be a shame if you overcooked it.
Dr. Yang doesn't.<eos> So they don't speak to each other even though they're married.<eos> No.<eos> How about you?<eos> Um, my girlfriend and I are gonna...<eos> Nothing. Nothing.<eos> We think this thing on Janell's lung is something called a teratoma.<eos> It's creating antibodies that are attacking her brain.<eos> Well, I don't get it.<eos> Basically, her body sees the tumor as an invader and is attacking it, and her brain is getting hurt in the crossfire.
Clear.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> No.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> His heart stopped, we tried to revive him, but despite our best efforts, he didn't make it.<eos> He died at 7:53 p.m.<eos> No indication of a tumor.<eos> It could be microscopic.<eos> There's a lot of adhesions on this one, that could mean inflammation.<eos> So let's take out the right ovary, send it to path, and try to save the left one.
How many more cars am I gonna have to get in and out of?<eos> This is it, Congressman.<eos> Is it cool if I call you that?<eos> Call me whatever shit you want.<eos> Just drive, kid.<eos> You got something for me?<eos> Cool.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Would you mind giving me your phone, please?<eos> I promise you'll get it back once you've talked to him.
They're too good.<eos> You need to answer that?<eos> No, ma'am, I do not.<eos> I'm not here.<eos> God bless.<eos> Beep.<eos> Hey, Tommy, it's your daddy.<eos> Uh... just wanted to hear your voice.<eos> Girl, I didn't even know you were capable of saying the word "cunt."<eos> I say it all the time.
Our slanderers now languish in oblivion while the name of Borgia lives in eternal glory.<eos> We will not dignify these vile words with a papal response.<eos> You defile love, you betray me.<eos> I could with the slightest gesture have you eviscerated.<eos> I do not know what you are talking about.<eos> How else could Colonna have got that text but from you?<eos> The pamphlet went missing from my room. May your lies choke your throat.<eos> All right.<eos> I confess.<eos> Della Rovere ordered me to give it to Colonna, but that has nothing to do with the love...
We could launch, but we'll be dead before we get to the ground.<eos> And I mean bad dead.<eos> Ruptured lungs, air bubbles in the brain.<eos> We need that part.<eos> Why?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Did something change?<eos> Clarke's wristband signal went out.<eos> Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything, right?<eos> She took it off like the rest of them.
Get your ass down here now.<eos> We have a job to do.<eos> SCOTT: Dude, I'm already in bed.<eos> And aren't we getting a little old for this?<eos> We do this for Coach.<eos> I thought we did this to Coach.<eos> Whatever, okay?<eos> You know he needs this.<eos> He lives for this stuff.<eos> He loves it.
- Mostly blue sky.<eos> The excursion should go ahead this time.<eos> - So what's the plan?<eos> - Retrace our steps...?<eos> And get lost again?<eos> No, we find the valley and the wormhole.<eos> And how exactly does this work?<eos> In this universe, the excursion was delayed.<eos> What if the wormhole was delayed as well?<eos> We could find it again.
Well, I guess this universe can be pretty confusing.<eos> Which is why I can't wait to get home.<eos> Haven't you ever thought, what if this is home?<eos> Dude, seriously?<eos> - Didn't go so great with Ellen?<eos> - She hates me.<eos> - You never had a chance.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because even under that terrible dress sense, there is a very cool girl.<eos> Come on, try and get it! - Hey!
- I don't know.<eos> Look, put 'em away.<eos> Don't want her to catch us snooping.<eos> Sam, if science can't get us home, magic will.<eos> You wanna know what I think?<eos> I think we're gonna be stuck here for the rest of our lives.<eos> Agh, Mia!<eos> Mia!<eos> I know that thing.<eos> Bring it to me.
I don't know what's worse, being chased by a demon or seeing you in your undies.<eos> Let's not celebrate prematurely.<eos> - Arcane Lane?<eos> - Mind reader.<eos> I'll catch up.<eos> I can't leave Mia.<eos> - I'll come with you.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - Why... why have you got a unicorn?<eos> - Mike gave it to me.
- It is us.<eos> We've done this.<eos> - Where's Jake?<eos> - Maybe there's another spell.<eos> - We don't have time to start again.<eos> - What took you so long?<eos> - I got it.<eos> Let's not get interrupted.<eos> This tablet belonged to my sister, Alice.<eos> I've never actually used it.
Another ballet student, Emma first time in history a sitting President's child has been abducted.<eos> There's no official word yet...<eos> Kyle?<eos> Now... you give me my knife back, or I blow a hole right through you.<eos> Where's Aziz?<eos> What have you done with him?<eos> And where is Beth Ann's father?<eos> Sort... the... clothing.<eos> Why would they take my picture but not Aziz's?<eos> Maybe they're taking it back there.
On the floor!<eos> Down!<eos> No one talks!<eos> Silence!<eos> Drone.<eos> It's a drone.<eos> Stanton Park, first bench.<eos> Northeast corner.<eos> I have left a package for you.<eos> Bring it into your embassy.

Out of the car, Ms. Fitch.<eos> Leave the keys.<eos> Over there in the trunk.<eos> Susie... it's Meg.<eos> I screwed up.<eos> Bad.<eos> I need help.<eos> A phone was sent to me.<eos> I got a call.<eos> A processed voice told me that if I wanted to see Amber again, to get that money together and where to take it.
We're on the first shift with you today.<eos> There are so many of you.<eos> Two for you, two for your husband.<eos> Marie here is my chief of staff.<eos> Where I go, she goes.<eos> Then it will just be the six of us.<eos> Shall we?<eos> You want to tell me why you didn't want me - in that interview with your sister? - No, I don't.<eos> You recorded that interview so I could<eos> - maybe listen to it later? - No, I didn't.
Please.<eos> Just let him go.<eos> Did it go?<eos> Did it go?<eos> Do I get my kid back now?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Finley, get his phone.<eos> - Step away!<eos> - I'm Secret Service.<eos> Finley, do not let them take it.
I'm gonna pick that up.<eos> You want to shoot a federal officer, go ahead.<eos> But do me a favor, aim for this side.<eos> I'm still tender over here.<eos> Do not touch that phone!<eos> Hand over the phone now!<eos> Hand it over!<eos> Step away!<eos> What was it?<eos> Did you see it?
Where's Sharlene?<eos> - When was the last time you saw her?<eos> - Last meal break.<eos> Sloan's missing, too.<eos> Did they take them? Did anyone see Sloan or Sharlene get taken?<eos> Is this it?<eos> Am I going home?<eos> That voice on the phone told us where to go, what to do.<eos> - Did you see the video?<eos> - No. - You were alone with it, but you didn't watch it? - No, that's right.
You know, it threatened 60% of their rice crop.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Speaking of which, I was thinking we should take rice off the menu completely, Harry, and replace it with a more...<eos> compassionate starch.<eos> Yeah, yeah, he... he can, figure out the menu as soon as we choose a theme.<eos> But you've already decided the menu.<eos> He did?<eos> - This morning.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he faxed it over.
I said don't turn around.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> That house belonged to my mother.<eos> It's stunning.<eos> East coast?<eos> Vermont.<eos> Yeah, she was a maid there for 34 years.<eos> Boss died, and he just left it to her.
I killed my son.<eos> How could I do that?<eos> How could I live with that?<eos> That's my punishment.<eos> This.<eos> I asked them for a day out so... I could see his grave.<eos> They said no.<eos> I just want to see his grave.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> You've seen it?
Run the credit card for 20% of the price and refund the money when they bring it back.<eos> Will that blond girl be coming in again?<eos> Often.<eos> She's a yeller.<eos> I've got inventory to do.<eos> Hey, I forgot to tell you... something came in this morning I wasn't expecting.<eos> It wasn't on the receiving list.<eos> What?<eos> This big, weird thing.<eos> I put it in the back.
Essen said we don't catch a break in the first 48, it's time to go see Fish Mooney.<eos> Fish Mooney?<eos> It works for Carmine Falcone? Her.<eos> Theater District's her turf.<eos> Anything happens down there, she hears about it.<eos> Tell Fish I'm here.<eos> I still care for you, deeply, but I don't believe that you still care for me anymore.<eos> I... care for you!<eos> Then where's my money?<eos> I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
Please, Mr. Gordon, just let me live!<eos> I'll do whatever you say.<eos> I'll be your slave for life.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> There's a war coming, a terrible war.<eos> Falcone is losing his grip, and his rivals are hungry.<eos> There... There will be chaos.<eos> Rivers of blood in the streets.<eos> I know it!<eos> I can see it coming!
But bright honor and labor and truth to your neighbor will bear you safe over life's seas."<eos> Commodore!<eos> Commodore!<eos> Here, please.<eos> Throw another.<eos> Mister!<eos> Mr. Commodore.<eos> Throw one to me.<eos> Now commences our sun-kissed summer, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> We sprinkle the sea with gold and the sea gives it back to us 100 fold.
This is his.<eos> Well?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Sir?<eos> Found my hat, didn't you?<eos> It's too much.<eos> Compared to what?<eos> Did you know that money was there?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Then why didn't you take it?
"You write."<eos> Y-O-U space W-R-I-T-E.<eos> Very good. "You wrote."<eos> Y-O-U space<eos> W-R-O-T-E.<eos> Very good. "Crawfish."<eos> C-R-A- Vv. F-I-S-H.<eos> Very good.<eos> I have a present for you.<eos> I made it for you.
I have a present for you.<eos> I made it for you.<eos> Say thank you.<eos> Say thank you.<eos> It's ugly-<eos> It's a gift.<eos> You don't say that. Say thank you.<eos> It's ugly-<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Pick it up and say thank you.
Circumstantial, yes, but plausible.<eos> I know you've reopened cases on less.<eos> This has gotta stop, man.<eos> We keep having the same conversation.<eos> It can't be an accident.<eos> Okay. I'm gonna show you something.<eos> CNN tried to get a hold of this. We 86'ed it out of respect to the family.<eos> The footage?<eos> It's not easy to watch.<eos> I want to see it.
Great. I'd like a list of all the people that will be attending.<eos> It's not that big a deal if I get left out, but you're the Secretary of State.<eos> I mean, Tusk should not be determining policy.<eos> The President alone should instruct you on what you are to pursue.<eos> What's their relationship?<eos> He's had his ear for years.<eos> An advisor...<eos> More of a mentor, and one whose advice is not easily dismissed.<eos> He's gonna keep pushing back on cyber warfare.<eos> Not if I get it on the agenda.
Does he have anybody on record yet?<eos> The Chinese aren't talking, and all the US delegation said is what's in the AP wire.<eos> I want something online in the next two hours.<eos> In-depth follow-up sometime this week.<eos> Hey, Lucas?<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah. Why?<eos> You're wearing the same clothes you wore yesterday.<eos> Am I?<eos> I don't know what's going on in your personal life, but it seems to be entering the workplace.
While he continues to benefit from a bump in approval ratings.<eos> A tough stance on China is popular, and we can use that to our advantage.<eos> Let's just be patient and see if we can smooth things over from back channels.<eos> If I don't see any results, you won't have my patience for long.<eos> That's understood.<eos> Let me know what Durant has to say.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Vice President.<eos> I thought he might balk at taking a handout from me.<eos> I'd call it more than a handout.
No one hears the truth.<eos> If you don't plead, no one will hear you, period.<eos> Not until you're in your 70s.<eos> Have you talked to Hammerschmidt yet?<eos> You're in no position to make demands.<eos> - It's not up to you.<eos> - All you'll do is piss them off.<eos> Look, we've got a good deal here.<eos> A great deal, considering what you did.<eos> You should take it before they change their mind.
That stubbornness is far more costly than obedience.<eos> Thanks for the water.<eos> - You're on the wrong side, Remy.<eos> - Yeah, well, one of us sure is.<eos> "And when the bumblebee flew home, "all his friends were waiting with buckets of honey." Right?<eos> And he's got his worm friend, and his mouse friend, and his spider friend, and his snail friend. And they all had tons of honey.<eos> And he looks happier now, right?<eos> - Yeah! - Yeah?<eos> "And so, they all buzzed with happiness.<eos> "Because life is sweet when you spend it with your friends."
We're at Camden Yards.<eos> Go, Orioles!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Move!<eos> Go, go!<eos> I'm told the distribution line that controls the pinch point caused the outages.<eos> BAPCO, one of your companies.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> There was a capacity issue.<eos> We're working as quickly as we can to resolve it.
How close is she?<eos> She never mentioned a casino. But now that I know what the dots are, I can see that she's starting to connect them.<eos> The Pentagon isn't talking yet.<eos> I imagine they're waiting on the White House.<eos> I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.<eos> Uh, let me call you right back.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, Lynn. It's Ayla.<eos> I just sent you a picture.<eos> Yeah, I got it.
Were you...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I was just watching.<eos> That's really funny.<eos> What about you?<eos> What are you watching?<eos> The video Connor gave me.<eos> It's our first state senate race.<eos> Oh, I forgot about that.<eos> So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Is this what you were keeping from me?<eos> We should follow your counsel's advice and not."<eos> Tell me if it's true. About the money.<eos> With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to all sorts...<eos> Damn it, Frank.<eos> I've been in the dark for too long on this.<eos> That ends now.<eos> I don't know any details.<eos> Feng told me if the bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.<eos> We approved it. The money stopped.
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.<eos> I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs.<eos> I'm fully aware and willing.<eos> But you're worse. You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Case in fucking point.<eos> Don't turn this.<eos> You knew about the money and you didn't tell me, even though it's thrown my seat into contention.<eos> Let's say there was money. And let's say I did know.<eos> What good would it have done?
I ain't ready to say good-bye to you.<eos> We still got work to do.<eos> Have you ever been in love, Marie?<eos> What has she done to you?<eos> Long time ago.<eos> I found love for the first time, and it's given me the passion to keep fighting.<eos> You can help me live, Marie.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> You know the secret.<eos> You gave it to that despicable, torturing racist.

Nothing could soothe my soul.<eos> I have nothing to offer this coven anymore.<eos> Who am I?<eos> What do I do?<eos> You buck up, is what you do!<eos> Face reality headlong and carry on.<eos> But how?<eos> I have no one, and my powers are gone.<eos> Your salad dressing is absolutely magical.<eos> Maybe you could bottle it.
I mean, the way you got inside her head, only ever seen Fiona do that.<eos> Fiona's a bitch.<eos> I'm gonna be a nice Supreme.<eos> I hear something. Yeah.<eos> You always hear something.<eos> What you doing? I heard it crying.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> That closet was...<eos> You the clairvoyant.<eos> You stole this baby to kill it. You don't know what you talking about.
I fear my restless mind will become feeble.<eos> You have us, your daughters.<eos> You have just made my point abundantly clear.<eos> I need inspiration.<eos> I'm sure you'll find your métier, Mother.<eos> I hear crochet is popular in New Orleans.<eos> Mother? !<eos> Do I have to bother with this... thing?<eos> Till the kitchen help arrive tomorrow, we gonna have to cook if we want to eat.<eos> Do I have to kill it?
This document is signed by every director in this room.<eos> It calls for a 100-year truce.<eos> No witch hunting of any kind until all of us who can die are long dead.<eos> This is the end.<eos> We give up.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay. Now, this is my offer to you.<eos> You disband this little merry troupe of assholes, vowing never to harm another witch from now until the end of time.<eos> I would also like you to sign over your house in Berkeley Square to me.<eos> But paint it first.
Transmutation.<eos> That's five Wonders accomplished.<eos> Let us move to the sixth.<eos> Divination.<eos> Cordelia?<eos> Fine.<eos> Okay, I'm back in. QUEENIE: Heh.<eos> What?<eos> it's only fair.<eos> This thing started as a competition. I say we end it like one.
We'd beat the Republicans and reinstall the king.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Where have you been living?<eos> In my wife's absence, I have my headquarters on her estate, where my son lives.<eos> You're more beautiful now than ever.<eos> That's just the candlelight.<eos> I remember every inch.<eos> In the small of your back there's a beauty spot.<eos> You didn't like it, when you saw it in the mirror.<eos> I loved it.
We'll be there too.<eos> What will happen to us if the Republicans find you?<eos> The Republicans are approaching.<eos> Good.<eos> Where's that secret room?<eos> Alexandre knows it.<eos> Take your father, while there's time.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I thought it was in the house.<eos> I've spent hours looking for it.
Every night, you risk your life for the people of this city.<eos> How can you expect me to do any less?<eos> And what about the lives of the people coming to your rally?<eos> This rally is about Starling City standing up and declaring with one voice that living afraid isn't living.<eos> I won't send a contrary message to people telling them to stay home, to stay scared.<eos> I've made my decision.<eos> That's the thing, alderman... whatever happens tomorrow night, it's not up to you.<eos> Ah, Mrs. Fazekas.<eos> The train set for your nephew just came in.<eos> He's going to love it. Oh.
"In 4 ears ou must have seen her Y, Y somewhere else once in a while."<eos> "A couple of times, yes."<eos> "Her husband was sick and didn't drive."<eos> But you already knew that.<eos> - Did you speakto her'?<eos> - I said hello.<eos> - From a distance'?<eos> - From a distance or up close, depending.<eos> Often?<eos> Life is not the same while you're living it as when you look back on it.
Anyone can be shocked when they get a letter.<eos> After all he could be a tax collector.<eos> He's a good boss, very respectful with his employees, he works a lot, often late into the night.<eos> Normally pick-ups are at the front, but he loaded at the back.<eos> I'm in charge of packages to be picked up by car.<eos> Did he stay for a long time'?<eos> A long time...<eos> I don't know exactly but several minutes for sure.<eos> Julien's cellphone, was it on or off'?<eos> I remember that he turned it off when we sat down to eat.
She knew his days were numbered.<eos> And when she took a lover...<eos> What was your reaction when you saw your son was dead'?<eos> I knew it wasn't from one of his attacks... and that his wife had had something to do with it.<eos> Of course... you don't have any proof'?<eos> Well no...<eos> I hoped that the wife would be next... his wife.<eos> And that's what happened, isn't it'?<eos> Talk to us about the package containing the jam.<eos> Who received it in the shop?

You said the light from friendship won't reach us for a million years - that's how far away we are.<eos> I hope our friendship feels closer today.<eos> Friends have a symmetrical relationship.<eos> Psychiatrist and patient, that's unbalanced.<eos> There is a power differential between psychiatrist and patient one that I'm well aware of, particularly with my own therapist.<eos> But we're just having conversations.<eos> - You threatened me with a reckoning.<eos> I can't claim unconsciousness on that one.<eos> You were searching for something in your head to incriminate me.<eos> I can only assume you didn't find it.
The time that he devotes to his work... He really takes pride.<eos> Belladonna for the heart.<eos> Chain of white oleander for the intestines.<eos> Ragwort for the liver.<eos> These flowers are all poisonous. Yes.<eos> This is judgment.<eos> The Ripper believes that his victim was toxic somehow. A poisonous man.<eos> He's so damn certain, he makes me sick.<eos> There is a pattern taking shape.<eos> I just have to convince my eyes to see it.
You didn't have to find me, Jack.<eos> You just had to listen to me.<eos> I put Miriam in a room with Hannibal Lecter.<eos> She stated definitively he is not the Chesapeake Ripper.<eos> That definitive enough for you?<eos> No.<eos> It wasn't.<eos> Where'd you find Miriam, Jack?<eos> The property was condemned years ago.<eos> Apparently, the Ripper has been using it since that time.
Wolves or bears don't eat where they kill. It'd have dragged him off.<eos> There's no eating here.<eos> We're gonna find everything.<eos> The viscera's exposed, the belly's laid bare, but there's no sign of rutting or gnawing, Jack.<eos> A rabid animal attacks victims at random and doesn't eat any part of them.<eos> Found the same wound patterns on a series of livestock mutilations in the area.<eos> Evisceration, dismemberment, yet everything accounted for. Livestock mutilations...<eos> That was practice? He's going to kill again.<eos> And he's gonna get better at it.<eos> And he's urbanizing his animal, moving it closer to the city...
You didn't answer my question.<eos> Came for a character reference.<eos> Patient-to-patient.<eos> What do you think of Dr. Lecter's therapy?<eos> It depends what you're in therapy for.<eos> I'm in therapy for all kinds of reasons.<eos> The Vergers slaughter 86,000 cattle a day and 36,000 pigs, depending on the season, but that's just the public carnage.<eos> What's your private carnage?<eos> I tried to kill my brother.<eos> Well, I assume he had it coming.
Tough as a livery pony who is resentful of the bit.<eos> The structure is designed to excite and antagonize the pigs.<eos> It's taken a while to find the perfect mix.<eos> Any pig will eat a dead man, but to get him to eat a live one...<eos> Some education is required.<eos> Carlo is experienced in this field.<eos> He actually fed a man to pigs in Tuscany. 20 years ago?<eos> That's one of my suits.<eos> I'll buy you a new one.<eos> We stuff the clothes with meat, scent it with human smells, and play the screams every time they are fed.
We stuff the clothes with meat, scent it with human smells, and play the screams every time they are fed.<eos> Come the real thing, we won't need the recording.<eos> It's not just about making Papa proud, it's about us.<eos> It's about family.<eos> I want you to be proud of me too, Margot.<eos> You're all I have.<eos> And I'm all you have.<eos> And this little piggy went, "Whee!" all the way home.<eos> - It sounds like I'm killing it.<eos> - You are killing it.

A theremin is an instrument that can create exquisite music without ever needing to be touched, but... It requires the rare gift of perfect pitch to play properly.
Who shot you?<eos> A friend.<eos> I've always admired teachers, molding impressionable young minds.<eos> But you can only learn so much and live.<eos> No one likes a know-it-all, Freddie. Hannibal Lecter taught you when you were an impressionable young mind.<eos> Your book's about Will Graham, it's not about me.<eos> Were you sleeping with Hannibal Lecter when you were his student, or is that a recent development?<eos> You are sleeping with him.<eos> I was just guessing.<eos> Figured you had to be sleeping with one of them. Maybe that's why you can't see it.
Time did reverse the teacup that I shattered there to come together.<eos> The place was made for Abigail and your world.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> The place was made for all of us, together.<eos> I wanted to surprise you.<eos> And you... you wanted to surprise me.<eos> I have let you know me.<eos> See me.<eos> I gave you a rare gift.<eos> - But you didn't want it.
Welcome home.<eos> Raven!<eos> Finn!<eos> I knew you couldn't be dead.<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> I don't care.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> You know that big scrap hold, the one on K deck?<eos> You built that from scrap?<eos> I kind of rebuilt it.
- This was all her plan.<eos> We were trying to come down here together.<eos> If we waited...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We couldn't wait because the council was voting whether to kill 300 people to save air.<eos> - When?<eos> - Today.<eos> We have to tell them you're alive.<eos> The radio's gone.<eos> It must've gotten loose during reentry.

Dr. Abigail Griffin, open this door immediately.<eos> The future doesn't belong to the chancellor or the council.<eos> It belongs to all of us.<eos> I should've told you about her. It's okay.<eos> I didn't think I'd see her again.<eos> But you wouldn't take off your wristband.<eos> You had hope.<eos> It's okay, I get it.<eos> I was around, passably cute, and now it's over. Hey.<eos> I found it.

Hey.<eos> I found it.<eos> Can you fix it?
Hold on that one.<eos> I know him.<eos> He was our liaison.<eos> We had a problem with operation Lennox.<eos> They're dead, Francis.<eos> Who's dead? Men... women... Children... most of our guys.<eos> It just got out of hand.<eos> That massacre video you need...<eos> It's locked inside a CIA vault.<eos> How you planning on getting it out?
Where?<eos> Where are they sending you, Hawkins?<eos> Washington, DC.<eos> He's gonna make me do it again. Who is?<eos> He is.<eos> What is that...?<eos> I do know you.<eos> Station orange, this is the doctor. Request for pickup.<eos> You're not gonna check for keistering?<eos> You want to put a blade up there, you can keep it.
I can't believe I'm actually talking to you.<eos> I miss you so much.<eos> everyone... Die!<eos> - Now!<eos> - Hey?<eos> What do you want?<eos> What do you got?<eos> boss?<eos> My wife did a horrific thing today so that we could get into Widener's phone.<eos> To protect our daughter that's why she did it.
- Now!<eos> - Hey?<eos> What do you want?<eos> What do you got?<eos> boss?<eos> My wife did a horrific thing today so that we could get into Widener's phone.<eos> To protect our daughter that's why she did it.<eos> So tell me you were able to monitor Widener's secure communications.<eos> I was.<eos> He'll figure out we've been in there, and shut it down.
Please, who doesn't experiment in college?<eos> Are you kidding? That's not experimenting.<eos> You guys were talking about adopting a kid together.<eos> That did not happen.<eos> Oh, my God, I distinctly remember you calling and saying you were gonna have two Mexican boys...<eos> - Wait, they're...<eos> - Salvadoran.<eos> Ali, get over here, you little hooker.<eos> You always do such a good job of getting the food, honey.<eos> Oh, thanks. You can put it on my tombstone.
It should still be at the archives.<eos> Let's hope so.<eos> It's written in some kind of code.<eos> You still haven't learned my alphabet, have you?<eos> - There are only so many hours in the day.<eos> - Rise earlier.<eos> The key to success lies under the alarm clock.<eos> Learn my alphabet, Crane.<eos> Did you know Franklin invented his own alphabet?<eos> I did, because he forced me to study it endlessly, insisting that it was far superior to the standard 26-letter one.

Coming back for me is a risk I cannot let you take.<eos> The Bible foretells two Witnesses.<eos> You and I must remain together if there is any hope of victory.<eos> The only risk, Lieutenant, is in leaving you behind.<eos> No matter what I say, you're coming back, aren't you?<eos> I made a promise.<eos> We need to be prepared.<eos> The second you open that door, Moloch and his army will do everything in their power to get out.<eos> Katrina left you a charm to defend against Moloch.<eos> I dropped it in the woods behind the church.
What do you want?<eos> This wasn't the introduction I had hoped for.<eos> Abraham.<eos> If the point of this illusion is to convince me that... that part of you still remains human, I assure you, it will not work.<eos> I don't blame you for being confused.<eos> You have borne so much.<eos> We both have.<eos> Since the day you were stolen from me.<eos> My heart shall never belong to you.<eos> I have given it to one man only.
Jay?<eos> You awake?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're not gonna believe me, but I need you to remember what I'm saying.<eos> OK?<eos> This thing it's gonna follow you.<eos> Somebody gave it to me and I passed it to you back in the car.
Forget Edwards.<eos> He's a fool.<eos> Yes, but he's a fool who studied with some very fine surgeons.<eos> I'm loath to take up his errand, but dumb luck may have stumbled him into something useful.<eos> And I think we can all agree there is nothing less useful than what we just attempted.<eos> We don't need him, we just need the surgical paper on the procedure.<eos> Dr. Wodsworth has an extensive library in his office on Park Avenue.<eos> He gets all the European journals.<eos> We'll look there.<eos> I highly doubt they'll be too keen on sharing it with anyone from The Knick.
Yeah.<eos> Should I be brushing up on my Proust?<eos> No FBI outside?<eos> You know I don't want the bureau to get ahold of that video.<eos> Regardless, as long as you're on that anklet, I'd rather not linger.<eos> - Where's my diamond?<eos> - Location's in here.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Giving up millions and millions of dollars for this one little video.<eos> You must really want it.
I'm worried, man.<eos> My last chance.<eos> Just let me help you.<eos> Have a good night, Mike.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I traced the license plate.<eos> It was stolen.<eos> Street cop found it abandoned near the Lexington entrance of Grand Central.
We're gonna need more booze.<eos> She tried to kill me at least twice.<eos> She did kill me, although I'm weirdly better off.<eos> They're talking about me, aren't they?<eos> They're reminiscing.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm sure I deserve everything that they're saying.<eos> Does my hand look wrinkled to you?<eos> It looks fine.<eos> If I start to sag anywhere, you take a knife and you jam it into my carotid artery immediately, ok?
Quit giving me that damn pouty face.<eos> I'm not giving you the pouty face.<eos> This is my "you're being a dick" face.<eos> Elena hasn't called you back.<eos> It's making you completely miserable.<eos> Yeah. I'm completely miserable.<eos> It's your fault, telling me to get her back.<eos> No.<eos> You're miserable because you did what you always do.<eos> You had a problem, and instead of dealing with it, you cut ties and you ran.
You know that.<eos> But Stefan is here.<eos> We were dancing.<eos> It was good, and I think he was even flirting with me, which is very naughty, even for him.<eos> Listen.<eos> If you don't start acting like you care, they will figure out you're not Elena.<eos> So if I happen to know exactly where he is, I'm supposed to go and put my life in danger to save that little rug rat's life?<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> He's at that hideous Whitmore house.<eos> I recognize it from the picture.
That's funny.<eos> Will you grab my bag?<eos> Sure.<eos> Be right there.<eos> I was on my way out of town, and then there she was, sitting on the front steps, waiting for me.<eos> Subtlety's not my strong suit.<eos> I felt bad about compelling him and bad about snapping your neck.<eos> Again, subtlety.<eos> So why haven't you been answering your phone?<eos> Uh, I lost it the first night.
No, you know what?<eos> I hate myself.<eos> I was dumb enough to sit next to her while she was dying... and actually forgive her.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Please tell me that's some good news.<eos> Bad news.<eos> It's not the same virus.<eos> What is it?<eos> Dr. Creepenstein was working on the next phase of his virus.<eos> When Nadia was sick, he was experimenting on her blood... and he figured out a way to extract werewolf venom from her blood and put it into the virus. Wait.
- I'm Sloan. You met some of the Travelers when they took a bucket of your blood.<eos> Oh, yeah. How could I forget?<eos> So you have the antidote to this Ripper virus, correct?<eos> We do, thanks to Enzo.<eos> I was trapped in that bloody farmhouse with Damon set to have my head torn off... when, out of nowhere, Wes, with the Travelers, saved me.<eos> - On the condition I owed him.<eos> - What does that have to do with us?<eos> He was low on vampires, and needed one to continue his work... so I let him experiment on me.<eos> Among other things, it allowed him to make an antidote.<eos> When he died, the Travelers took it.
You're lying to me.<eos> Why is everyone lying to me?<eos> Hey"<eos> Damn it.<eos> Donovan.<eos> Donovan, get your ass in here.<eos> Chill. I'm right here.<eos> What?<eos> Phone's dead.<eos> Charge it for me.
He's been dead for centuries, and we think the fire sacrifice allowed him to escape.<eos> Perfect.<eos> A dead old guy with a mysterious, evil plan.<eos> I'll take that drink now.<eos> Stefan just called.<eos> He said the scrap yard's been completely cleared out.<eos> And let me guess-- the witches don't know where Markos is.<eos> You guys said the visions are trying to draw Elena and Stefan together for something.<eos> For our doppelganger blood.<eos> The Travelers need it for some prophecy.
Some of us are more extreme than others, but that's just who we are.<eos> How come you're so much better at controlling it?<eos> Because I'm so much worse when I don't.<eos> I'm only gonna say this once.<eos> You two are miserable without each other, so if you want to be with him, just be with him.<eos> When humans want to break free from complicated relationships, they go to therapy.<eos> Vampires get a pass, ok?<eos> Come on.<eos> I ordered us waffles.<eos> I figured our last meal wouldn't be complete until we poured liquid sugar all over it. Mmm.
Now if it did leak, it could be deadly, as in massive explosion kind of deadly.<eos> We can't blow up our hometown.<eos> Says one of the only people left in this group who can actually live there.<eos> We're not blowing up our town.<eos> We just need to lure enough travelers to one spot.<eos> How?<eos> We can't lure anyone anywhere stuck out here.<eos> And that's where your mama comes in.<eos> She will convince them to gather somewhere inside.<eos> Meanwhile, these two geniuses at 7:00 will turn on the gas, let it leak.

You'll never manage the next branch on your family tree if you don't show more industry than that.<eos> Really?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Mrs. Randall, what am I to do with you?<eos> Right.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're gonna break the bed.<eos> You know, one of those things I used to try and remember lying in my cot, was the sound of my husband's laugh.<eos> I couldn't conjure it no matter what I did.

It will be tender for about a week.<eos> You'll need a sling.<eos> You, fetch me a long piece of cloth or a belt.<eos> "Fetch me? she says.<eos> Do ye hear that, lads?<eos> Give her yer belt.<eos> - I'm taking a guess you've done this before.<eos> Not a wet nurse.<eos> You mustn't move the joint for two or three days.<eos> When you begin to use it again, go very slowly at first.
Do you understand me?<eos> Gimme your foot.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Careful!<eos> What are you trying to do?<eos> I'll get my plaid loose to cover ye.<eos> You're shivering.<eos> Thank you, but I'm fine, really.<eos> You're shaking so hard, it's making my teeth rattle.<eos> The plaid will keep us both warm, but I canna do it one-handed.
Well, we can load the gurneys in the ambulance, but I ain't got the strength to pull 'em back alone.<eos> So you got to keep pushing.<eos> - I'll help you.<eos> - I'll come, too.<eos> I want to check on the condition of things.<eos> I'm sure my office is a shambles.<eos> Then I'll see Nurse Elkins gets home safely and I'll meet you there.<eos> What about my bike?<eos> Well, if it hasn't already become a victim of the riot, it certainly won't at this point.<eos> You can get it in the morning.
Excuse me.<eos> It's heavy traffic in the Callahan tunnel.<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> Please track this GPS signal.<eos> Track it.
Get fruit. Go to bank and deposit check."<eos> Okay, even I direct-deposit.<eos> Yeah, so does she.<eos> I checked her bank records.<eos> Why else would you go to the bank?<eos> Did you check to see if she was paying for a safe-deposit box?<eos> Yeah, she wasn't. I'm such a good customer, my gold card gives me one for free.<eos> Did she have a credit card through her bank?<eos> Yeah. So maybe she had a free safe-deposit box.<eos> No payment record. You wouldn't be able to trace it.
But I cannot, in good conscience, go on with my life and allow him to rape another woman.<eos> You framed her and you killed her, you piece of crap.<eos> Clay, please.<eos> The fact that I had sex with Natalie does not mean that I killed her.<eos> No. No, it doesn't.<eos> But this does.<eos> Please track this GPS signal.<eos> It's Christopher.<eos> He's got a GPS jammer on his phone, but I think I've got it.<eos> Track it. Track it to where I am right now!
LONG LIVE FRANCO VICTORY WAS OURS AND ALWAYS WILL BE<eos> Pedro!<eos> Over here!<eos> What's up?<eos> I'll get the car.<eos> I'll see if I can reach it.<eos> I'm almost touching the water.<eos> Careful!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I got it, pull me up!
Garbage.<eos> Tie up the geese, I need to take a leak.<eos> Abelardo!<eos> Abelardo, come here!<eos> Carmen.<eos> Estrellla.<eos> Go back to the oar, I forgot my notebook.<eos> - Where was that?<eos> - Back there.<eos> Then why are you putting it here?
Estrellla.<eos> Go back to the oar, I forgot my notebook.<eos> - Where was that?<eos> - Back there.<eos> Then why are you putting it here?<eos> - With the other stuff.<eos> - What stuff?<eos> The pile.<eos> All together so nothing gets lost.<eos> I'll put it back if you want.

Looks like they left in a hurry.<eos> They left when they found out their daughter had drowned.<eos> They couldn't set foot in the house after that.<eos> You know them?<eos> Beatriz, Estrella and Carmen. Charlie's Angels.<eos> The one in the middle is Quini.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> His mother disappeared three years ago.<eos> My husband gave her this cross.<eos> She never took it off.
- Who rented it last?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> It's been closed for a long time.<eos> It's the off season.<eos> I was here yesterday and I saw three people enter the house.<eos> Nice, very pretty.<eos> You're hurting me!<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Who was here yesterday?<eos> I don't know who rents it.

- A good-looking guy named Quino or Quini.<eos> They develop them there too, but they wouldn't tell me about them.<eos> But definitely not communion photos.<eos> I think there's someone else there.<eos> You can see the reflection of whoever took the photo.<eos> He's blurred by the flash.<eos> Tell me who he is and you'll get your photos.<eos> All right, but I'll need the negative.<eos> Otherwise it's impossible.<eos> I won't use it.
Adding growth factor so the cells will build a critical mass for the genome sequencing.<eos> And we stick it in the incubator and wait.<eos> - So, do the thing I've been doing for the last hour.<eos> Is that supposed to happen?<eos> So, then you said you're growning the virus?<eos> - It wasn't supposed to grow like that.<eos> - You mean like it was alive?<eos> Viruses aren't living organisms.<eos> They lack any form of energy or carbon metabolism.<eos> - Why did it Hulk out?
I know what it's like.<eos> Gwendolyn, I just don't want you to trust him over your own feelings, okay?<eos> The Diamond, so cold...<eos> The Ruby, so bright...<eos> A lion stalks her.<eos> Deep below...<eos> The green eyes... Aunt Maddy!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The heart of the Ruby...<eos> A Lion strikes it down with his paw. – What?
- Here.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm making sure you can see in both directions.<eos> You stay like this and keep watch.<eos> You're leaving us?<eos> They may be from the prison.<eos> - I need to help them.<eos> - We need you.<eos> Mica, tuck your shirt behind your knife so it's easier to grab.
You know, I'll bet this bitch got you all messed up, hmm?<eos> Am I right?<eos> Got you walking around here like a dead man who just lost himself a piece of tail.<eos> Must have been a good'un.<eos> Tell me something.<eos> Was it one of the little'uns?<eos> 'Cause they don't last too long out here.<eos> - Easy, fellas, easy.<eos> Let's just put our weapons down. See if we can't figure out what's really the problem here, huh?<eos> - Did you claim it?
What, like a nasty life-ending bite?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> At worst you might experience severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.<eos> Enough. I get the picture.<eos> This one was just a baby.<eos> It must have hatched while I was out.<eos> A baby?<eos> I found the egg weeks ago.<eos> And so you brought that here?<eos> I was going to study it.
[imitating singing jar] [chirps] Mimos.<eos> Mimos.<eos> (Lucas ) He's okay.<eos> [imitates jar singing] Kate, he's activating the crystals.<eos> (Kate ) Quick Mimos, it's okay.<eos> Go home. Quick, it's happening.<eos> We've got to go.<eos> I've got to get the diary.<eos> (Lucas ) The portal is opening.<eos> I can't reach it.
I knew she didn't swallow.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where'd you make reservations for tomorrow night?<eos> What?<eos> I'm trying to pretend like we're a normal couple.<eos> Um... well, I got us a table for two at Lorenzo's.<eos> The one by the fireplace.<eos> I can't wait for you to see my dress.<eos> It's sexy, but not slutty.<eos> I can't wait to see it.
What the fuck is that?<eos> - It's a pee funnel.<eos> - A what?<eos> I'm tired of trying to pop a squat over them nasty-ass toilets.<eos> This rig is gonna make it easy.<eos> Girl, that's crazy.<eos> How you gonna use that?<eos> Yo, with this, I can pee standing up.<eos> Like a dude.<eos> Take this part, put it over my stuff.
So, just tell me to roll over, and I totally will.<eos> - Morning, Officer Bell.<eos> - O'Neill.<eos> Wow. I didn't expect the bunks to feel so dorm-y.<eos> It kind of reminds me of camp, you know?<eos> Except without the gimp bracelets and the archery and kind of sad.<eos> What a bunch of vultures.<eos> Wait, did you just steal that book?<eos> It's mine.<eos> I'm reclaiming it.
Deep breaths.<eos> Time is all relative.<eos> You'll be together before you know it.<eos> And married.<eos> We'll be married.<eos> Of course you will.<eos> I've decided not to wear a veil.<eos> It's too traditional.<eos> And I want him to see my face.<eos> Why hide it? It's gorgeous.
You can't say, "shit."<eos> Well, can I say, "bitch"?<eos> 'Cause here's what Flaca say,<eos> "Try to reason with the bitch to lay off the sticky fingers, "but if she doesn't listen, "you know, drag her to a place where no one can see,<eos> Jesus saw that.<eos> You can't write any of that.<eos> You know the administration needs to approve all of this.<eos> Why don't you tell her to go buy a sturdy lock at the commissary?<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> Buy a lock, stick it in a sock and slock the bitch down.
Good PR for the prison.<eos> Right, the prison.<eos> Mmm, this shameful sexual violation is really working out for you, isn't it?<eos> I am just happy that we have helped to start a dialogue.<eos> And I wanna thank you, Joe, for your assistance in my handling of this.<eos> You deserve recognition.<eos> How about a token of your appreciation in the $200 to $300 range?<eos> In lieu of that, I have something else for you.<eos> B-Dorm bathroom.<eos> You're fixing it?
Yeah.<eos> Go down to the office and make me 100 copies of this.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> While I'm here, I'd like to ask you something.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I want you to take this piece of paper.<eos> I want you to take this pencil.<eos> I want you to write down a feeling and put it in the Feelings Jar.
Are you always this quick to anger?<eos> Are you always a condescending cunt?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Well, I think we have our work cut out for us.<eos> My shoes feel tight.<eos> But I'm saying this guy, Heinrich Dreser, deserves to be right up there on the bad-guy shelf.<eos> So, our buddy Heinrich oversaw the development of heroin at Bayer.<eos> Yep.<eos> So, the corporate suits at Bayer sold this shit over the counter as a non-addictive morphine substitute in the early 1900s, and you know why they called it heroin?
Got yourself a deal.<eos> Did you get your pack of wild dogs under control?<eos> They're always obedient.<eos> Good.<eos> Then I'll look forward to never seeing them in here again.<eos> Who do you think gave the order, Red?<eos> You're my friend.<eos> I don't remember us exchanging woven bracelets.<eos> You're not taking over my business.<eos> I started it.
"leopard cub kills baboon and tries to adopt its baby."<eos> Then you come back tomorrow and you tell me babies are born with sin.<eos> Why don't you give us the highlights?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> A leopard cub kills a baboon, right?<eos> And then as the leopard's dragging the bloody baboon corpse home for dinner, a baby baboon falls from the folds of its dead mother.<eos> And you're thinking, "Leopard's gonna eat the baby," right?<eos> A little baby baboon appetizer before the main course?<eos> But, no, he shelters the baby.<eos> He even defends it against a hyena.
But I'll say this for my hairy-backed husband... he always took care of me.<eos> Turned him on.<eos> Could spend weeks down there.<eos> I do enjoy the release.<eos> It cracks my neck.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Stop it with this nonsense.<eos> Believe me, all I want is to eat that sandwich, but I can't break my strike with 100 nuns out there.<eos> Please take it away!
You're stronger, you heal faster, but you're not in control.<eos> I can teach you.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> When do we start?<eos> Got your latest customer.<eos> Genius who held up the convenience store across the street from a police precinct.<eos> Not the smartest plan.<eos> Come on through.<eos> Bum knee.<eos> I had it replaced a few years ago.
Ok, a simple snatch and grab.<eos> Don't know why Mr. Armitage thought we needed you.<eos> For that.<eos> Step away from the device.<eos> You don't know what it is you're dealing with.<eos> Big machine, makes earthquakes?<eos> Do you have any idea what happens if the wrong people have it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I get paid.<eos> Close it up.
Look, I got to get back to work.<eos> Has Roy mentioned anything about the man in the skull mask who injected him?<eos> Roy is not the kind of guy who is comfortable discussing his feelings.<eos> Not like you and me.<eos> Don't yell at me, but I really think we need a new plan on how to find this creepy mask guy.<eos> Scaring the crap out of low-lifes isn't yielding results.<eos> Felicity, I am open to any and all suggestions.<eos> Oliver, maybe we're over thinking this.<eos> What if the mask simply got wind that you were after him and decided to skip town?<eos> He didn't go to all the trouble of recreating the serum and testing it on people just to walk away.
I see that you have been lying to me, and I see that you have been stealing from me!<eos> I can explain that.<eos> Every person that stands where you're standing now says the same thing.<eos> Dad...<eos> The DUI, the paranoia about Blood, you're looking like hell.<eos> You got a problem, Laurel.<eos> No.<eos> It's addiction.<eos> No! It runs in the family.<eos> You can't pin it on Sebastian Blood.
So.<eos> What are you going to do with this information?<eos> Felicity.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Confronting you in your living room was as far as my plan went.<eos> I thought you deserved the chance to tell Oliver yourself.<eos> He should hear it from you.<eos> I'm not going to tell my son anything.<eos> And neither are you.<eos> If you won't keep my secret for Oliver's sake, you should keep it for your own.
Montreal, a beach in Carolina.<eos> Leave everyone behind.<eos> I'd go anywhere you told me to.<eos> I had the money, Junia.<eos> I tried.<eos> I try every day to get there.<eos> But I've made some mistakes.<eos> What sort of mistakes?<eos> I took money from my employer.<eos> I invested it with a Wall Street man that said it couldn't lose.

Afraid not, Harry.<eos> Even so, would you like to say something or should I?<eos> You and I both know it'd be hypocritical coming from me.<eos> Do her more harm than good.<eos> Hey, you boys want to fuck away off?<eos> The sister wants to say a prayer.<eos> Give her some smart words to go on her way.<eos> O God, by your mercy, rest is given to the souls of the faithful.<eos> Be pleased to bless this grave.<eos> Appoint your holy angels to guard it and set free from all the chains of sin the soul of her whose body is buried here, so with all thy saints she may rejoice in thee forever.
Nineteen windows, $3 each.<eos> Seven lab kits, $4 each.<eos> One upright cabinet, $2.10.<eos> One long cabinet, $5.40.<eos> One medium-length cabinet, $2.20... And the list goes on and on.<eos> What about the drugs?<eos> Drugs.<eos> We're out of cocaine.<eos> We're aware, Doctor.<eos> It's a vital anesthetic. Our patients need it. Barrow?

Barrow?<eos> Short of launching a ship and stopping the attacks, there's little we can do.<eos> There must be some supplies of it in the city. I mean, it's your product.<eos> You're only too happy to sell it to us.
I won't do that to Lillian.<eos> Lillian is gone.<eos> And we can't bring her back.<eos> We must begin to look forward.<eos> Isn't that right, Sister?<eos> God has placed this child here for a reason.<eos> No, God has cursed us.<eos> We have proven we are incapable of caring for a child.<eos> And I won't be responsible for the death of another.<eos> Please, take the baby out of here before we infect it.
Perhaps you could advance us the drugs and we could pay you once we've charged the patients.<eos> Your patients can't pay.<eos> This has always been the Church's issue with the Knick. Your policies create dependency.<eos> Why would they advance us anything?<eos> Our chief surgeon is gone. His predecessor killed himself. And the only man left here with a scalpel is a Negro.<eos> But there is a solution.<eos> Same one we've had all along.<eos> Close the Knick and move uptown.<eos> The decision has to be made now.<eos> Metropolitan Hospital has made an offer for my land uptown. I can't hold it for us any longer.
Why do you need a room?<eos> Need a credit card, right?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Can we just check me in?<eos> - I really don't want to talk about it.<eos> - Okay, fine. How long will you be staying?<eos> Uh, just... a while probably.<eos> I don't know... a few months.<eos> Somebody torched my house.<eos> They burned it down to the ground.
Let's just say I had my reasons.<eos> Don't you ever get tired of being so stoic?<eos> Seriously, you never want to talk about anything.<eos> It's a little boring.<eos> So is being dead.<eos> You learn not to shoot your mouth off in this business.<eos> Okay, tough guy, whatever.<eos> I get it.<eos> Sometimes it just feels good to whale on someone.<eos> I whacked the shit out of the real-estate agent who sold me this house when I found out that I-I couldn't unload it.
There's water to wash.<eos> You should be careful.<eos> A man might help himself to what's on offer, if it's so pretty.<eos> It's not on offer.<eos> If he's any kind of gentleman he'd know that.<eos> Well, that told me.<eos> And he wouldn't help himself to the ale, either.<eos> The landlord here is a brutal man.<eos> I know the landlord.<eos> But take it, if it makes you feel better.
You don't wanna be stuck with me.<eos> Married to the job, you know what it's like.<eos> You should be with people your own age. Having fun.<eos> If you like, I can... sub you rent for a while, till you find a job.<eos> Yeah, but I don't want any old job.<eos> I wanna do something exciting.<eos> Actually, I know a guy who's got contacts in events management.<eos> Or I could try stripping!<eos> Did you bring the present?<eos> I thought we could open it together.
Someone who just got their degree from University State and is looking to pick up hours toward their certification.<eos> Okay.<eos> Of course, we do have some subbing coming up.<eos> - That'd be great.<eos> - We got a lady choir teacher. Third pregnancy in four years. I am like,<eos> "Honey, shut the damn bedroom door," you know?<eos> Right, well, I'm gonna leave my resume with you, Darlene because I'd be thrilled to subbing or if you get the money for a position...<eos> You know, I just have to ask you one more question.<eos> When you had the album out, which I loved, by the way...<eos> I used to listen to it all the time when I'd take my Sunday afternoon lady baths.
Where did you say this machine was originally?<eos> The fellas at Johns Hopkins had it.<eos> They've since found a better model, so I took it off their hands, which is fortunate for you.<eos> - And it works fine?<eos> - Like it was new.<eos> My children were taking dozens of X-rays of themselves on it the other day.<eos> Had the thing running for hours. No trouble at all.<eos> Seem to be some nicks and dents.<eos> Well, that's to be expected from a secondhand piece.<eos> If you don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself.
She even prepared breakfast for Lillian this morning.<eos> It's not uncommon.<eos> Once you place Lillian in the ground,<eos> I don't envy the powerful wave of melancholia that will engulf this house.<eos> Perhaps there might be a solution to help ease your loss.<eos> What is it?<eos> Recently a very young baby, a girl, was found on the doorstep of the orphanage.<eos> I understand my impertinence, but I've seen many a grieving mother.<eos> Death takes not only the soul of the child, but can destroy the souls of those left behind.<eos> If Eleanor can hold a baby, nurture it, you can begin to find your way again to heal.
I could help pay for their time.<eos> I miss them, too.<eos> They are more proof of God than anything else I've ever seen on this Earth, but their usefulness to us, at least medically, has passed.<eos> What you choose to do with them on your own time is entirely up to you.<eos> Dr. Chickering is now inserting the deflated bladder, which is sheathed to keep the shape small while entering the vaginal canal.<eos> We are now entering the uterus.<eos> With this new procedure, there is no danger of exsanguination, as our bladder has slowed the bleeding to a trickle.<eos> Retractors.<eos> The baby is alive.<eos> The patient will live to mother it.
- Dr. Edwards.<eos> May I officially welcome you to the Knick?<eos> Cards.<eos> That's a nice one. And that is a nice one.<eos> Good evening, gentlemen.<eos> Neely.<eos> Come to bring your dad some good luck? Hobart's taken all your inheritance.<eos> Is that true, Mr. Showalter?<eos> Perhaps just dented it a bit.<eos> You'll get it all back when you and Phillip are married.
Because I can never repay you without him.<eos> Well, I ain't gonna loan you any more money, I'll tell you that right now.<eos> But I may find it in my heart to advance your man some few bindles of the drug.<eos> You can do that?<eos> Ain't you been listening?<eos> I'm in the hooker line.<eos> How do you think these dumb young clucks are able to face each day of their miserable fucking lives?<eos> Cocaine, morphine, ether.<eos> I can get my hands on practically anything.<eos> Consider it part of your loan.
I can perform the procedure, but I cannot perform it on you.<eos> You have to.<eos> Please.<eos> I can't kill my own child.<eos> What are the alternatives?<eos> We could sail to Europe.<eos> Liberia.<eos> They're more tolerant there.<eos> Europe? Liberia?<eos> There's no place on earth we can raise it, Algie.
I'm gonna find out tonight.<eos> So, how's life in San Francisco?<eos> Oh, it's good.<eos> I'm barely there.<eos> This case has me traveling half the month.<eos> Big case.<eos> Yeah, defending a cellphone company.<eos> Competitor says my client stole their phone design, so my client's looking at $100 million in legal bills, give or take.<eos> I'd be happy to take some.<eos> Listen, the, um -- the thing is, several times now, in meetings, uh, my phone gets hot even though I haven't used it, you know, like it's been on the whole time,

So, tell us about the seller inside Cartesian.<eos> I know nothing.<eos> I mean -- all contact is anonymous.<eos> When the seller has a file to sell, he drops a newspaper at the park.<eos> We have a simple code.<eos> This one says "same price as last time."<eos> Then what happens?<eos> Um...we have another spot in the same park for the actual exchange.<eos> I leave cash.<eos> The seller picks it up, leaves a flash drive with the data.
And that is a virtue.<eos> It's not a sin.<eos> Wayne? Hey, Grace, I can't contact Ardiles.<eos> His office hasn't heard from him since Friday.<eos> Can't exactly call the guy and tell him his cellphone's been bugged.<eos> Can you ping his cellphone, try and figure out where he is?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> 1313 Owens Street.<eos> 1313 Owens Street.<eos> Yeah, got it.
You may.<eos> I want an apology from her, from agent Lisbon's lips!<eos> Mr. Haibach, I am very sorry if I've caused you any inconvenience.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> It better not!<eos> Agents.<eos> Please, sir, you can't drop this.<eos> We're not.<eos> There's something off about that man.<eos> I want you to put a surveillance team together, but just give it 24 hours before you do.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> ! Sorry.<eos> You can't go in there!<eos> He's not upstairs.<eos> I'll call in a BOLO.<eos> This doesn't make any sense.<eos> His monitor says that he's right here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> 'Cause he modified his cellphone to give out the same signal as the ankle monitor.<eos> You leave it on, everybody thinks he's still home.
No, you wouldn't murder Dan for that.<eos> You found Kern's slush fund.<eos> You killed Dan so you could have the money for yourself.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We're not turning you in.<eos> The Cooperative makes its own justice.<eos> You're not gonna get away with this, Bryce.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Well, we know where you hid the money, and we took it.
Bad luck, I guess.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Nice work.<eos> What the hell is this? !<eos> Hey, hey, wait a minute, Dan!<eos> Let me explain!<eos> Let me explain!<eos> We're not keeping the money.<eos> That's not what we were supposed to do.<eos> We deserve it, Dan!
What the hell is this? !<eos> Hey, hey, wait a minute, Dan!<eos> Let me explain!<eos> Let me explain!<eos> We're not keeping the money.<eos> That's not what we were supposed to do.<eos> We deserve it, Dan!<eos> They are profiting off of our land!<eos> Doesn't make it right.<eos> I'm giving it back.
You think if I talk to this lawyer woman to woman, it would have any effect?<eos> Don't waste your time.<eos> Okay, here we are.<eos> Home sweet home. Come on, darling, let's get you inside.<eos> Get you something warm.<eos> Okay, now, mind those steps, 'cause those are slippery.<eos> Hey, shut the door behind you.<eos> Don't let the heat out.<eos> Phone's in the bedroom.<eos> I'll go get it.
Hi.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Oh, just wanted to apologize for leaving you out there without a ride.<eos> I understand. All in the line of duty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got you that thing you wanted.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How did you...<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Jane gave it to me.
Sure.<eos> Oh. Oh.<eos> Let me call you back, okay?<eos> Here you go. Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Morning, Jane.<eos> Cab to a crime scene?<eos> That's very Cosmopolitan of you.<eos> Well, my car wouldn't start.<eos> Well, of course it wouldn't.
We believe that David Ronaldo was murdered because he had evidence that would clear Luis Cruz.<eos> We need to find out what that was.<eos> And because they're going to execute Cruz in about...50 hours, we should hurry up.<eos> Boss, is there any evidence that the cops or the prosecutors made a mistake?<eos> Not that I can point to.<eos> And this case was fully appealed, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then can I ask why we're taking this on?<eos> I-I don't want to sound cold, but it seems to me that the system did what it was supposed to do.<eos> No, it didn't.
What if she got audio of the -- of the killer?<eos> What's on it?<eos> They don't know.<eos> It's too damaged.<eos> They can repair it, but it'll take weeks.<eos> No need.<eos> We can identify the killer today. How?<eos> I'm gonna do a routine onstage with four objects that I will say I got from the club's lost and found.<eos> One of those will be this phone.<eos> When the killer sees it, he will identify it as Madison's.

I'm gonna need the assistance of the irreplaceable special agent Teresa Lisbon.<eos> Earlier today, I approached four random members of the club.<eos> Uh, are they here?<eos> Could you raise your hands?<eos> Yes. I asked each of these men to go to the club lost and found and to choose one item and place it in a cardboard box and then seal that box.<eos> Do we have the box here? Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, just to be clear, neither I nor agent Lisbon saw what you picked or know the contents of this box. Is that correct? That's correct.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Now, without the benefit of sight, I am going to attempt to identify each object as agent Lisbon holds it up.
A big Foragers' thank-you to Mr. Jane and special agent Lisbon.<eos> Terrific.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> I know you can hear me... And see me...<eos> 'Cause you've got a camera in here.<eos> You did it so you can blackmail one of Madison's clients.<eos> It's how you also knew that you needed to clean that golf cart before the tech got here.<eos> We only talked about it in this room, so we know you heard.<eos> It's how you also knew not to take the phone.<eos> But I still got it.
Who was the date?<eos> Did you get a name? No.<eos> Uh, an alias.<eos> But we got a photo.<eos> Ressler.<eos> Get a medic.<eos> We pulled the unsub's photo off a dating website and got a match from a rental-car surveillance camera.<eos> His name's Eric Trettel.<eos> Flunked out of med school.<eos> Falsified a degree from Harvard and used it to land a job in the Human Genome Project.
to foster care.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> That must have been very difficult.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, in many ways... Charles and I blame ourselves.<eos> In hindsight, we weren't ready. We...<eos> The marriage was troubled.<eos> We-- we just weren't equipped for a child.<eos> Directive for a mandatory security upgrade.<eos> The person who ordered it signed page 6.
- We've got nothing!<eos> No license plate, no surveillance footage.<eos> They could be anywhere by now.<eos> Back up, Lizzy.<eos> Rifkin.<eos> Go back to Rifkin.<eos> Why would The Judge hold Cooper responsible for his execution?<eos> Because he coerced Rifkin's confession.<eos> You're certain of that?<eos> Cooper admitted it to me.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> They miss home.<eos> Just a few more weeks.<eos> Go to bed.<eos> You look exhausted.<eos> I got a stack of case files I need to get through.<eos> I have waited a long time for this reunion, Agent Raimo.<eos> We've had the pleasure? Yes.<eos> Though it could hardly be called pleasurable.
I have waited a long time for this reunion, Agent Raimo.<eos> We've had the pleasure? Yes.<eos> Though it could hardly be called pleasurable.<eos> I was captured by your task force... collateral damage in your hunt for Raymond Reddington.<eos> Mako Tanida.<eos> On your knees.<eos> I have no intention of getting... Aah!<eos> You lack honor and humility, Agent Raimo.<eos> I will provide you with both.<eos> Take up that tanto and remove it from its scabbard.
I've always known this.<eos> And it didn't occur to you to say something earlier?<eos> You FBI are such blunt instruments.<eos> Lizzy, you don't just swoop in and arrest a man like Ivan, because you know what he'll tell you once he's in custody?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I assume you have a better idea?<eos> If you want to know what Ivan is up to, you have to get him to share that.<eos> Not because he has to, because he wants to.<eos> How do I do that?<eos> We create a problem for him and then solve it.
You realize if you leave, the task force ends.<eos> Everyone's lives go back to normal, except yours.<eos> This doctor friend of yours-- tell me about him.<eos> He was the lead research scientist on infectious diseases at USAMRIID and the foremost expert on the Cullen virus.<eos> "Was." Now he's a criminal.<eos> No, the work he's done has been criminalized, which is why he left USAMRIID.<eos> But if anybody knows anything about black-market viruses, it's Dr. Bruce Sanders.<eos> This is a copy of Tom's code book.<eos> It was used to pass information between Tom and his superiors.<eos> I had my associate Borakove decode it.
A few years back, he injected himself with meningitis and along with what he thought was a synthesized cure.<eos> Oops!<eos> But I'm-- no, I'm- - I'm-- I'm fine, really.<eos> Full recovery.<eos> Doctor, we've come to you on pressing business.<eos> What can you tell us about the Cullen virus?<eos> Oh, spooky.<eos> Spooky stuff.<eos> Bad news.<eos> You've researched it?
Actually, Shelly,<eos> I don't mind.<eos> I don't mind, big time, okay?<eos> Your grandfather didn't die trying to save this place.<eos> He died trying to set this thing on fire.<eos> The only reason he had it in the first place was because...<eos> Grandmother loved to read.<eos> Your grandmother loved to read so much, you know, and when then she died, he was like,<eos> "good, get rid of it.<eos> I don't want it."

This is tyranny.<eos> I'm sorry. Can you put some mustard...<eos> I shouldn't have to put mustard on my face for this to make sense.<eos> You know we have to take this system down.<eos> You know... I once loved a Two.<eos> Matthew...<eos> He was my everything.<eos> But numbers change.<eos> I'll keep your secret, new Beenz.<eos> It says you're next.
A specialist under my command came to me, said that Ron and these Artemus guys had raped her.<eos> I reported the incident to my superior but was told to look the other way.<eos> But Ron was under your command.<eos> He was transferred before I could do anything except file a restricted complaint. Went nowhere.<eos> What was the name of the specialist?<eos> - Frankie Gonzales.<eos> - Do you know where she is?<eos> As far as I know, she's in South Carolina.<eos> Do you remember the date this attack on Gonzales happened?<eos> Never forget it.
"The beast described had a most unusual body, "reflected by a physical duality.<eos> "Part lowen, it also had a scorpion-like tail "which could protrude from its spine, "having a spike-like nail at the end<eos> "When I attempted to make a move on this wesen, "I discovered there were several more in the ranks.<eos> "I quickly put away my blade to conceal my identity as a Grimm.<eos> "I was to learn they were some "of the most lethal soldiers in our command, for they have no fear of death." Whew.<eos> I don't like that "no fear of death" thing.<eos> It's not healthy.<eos> Nick, what do you got?<eos> A confession... To the gang rape of Frankie Gonzales.<eos> Looks like Troy finished writing it just before he was killed.
They didn't work.<eos> - They didn't see the flares.<eos> - A meteor shower tells you that?<eos> It's not a meteor shower, it's a funeral.<eos> Hundreds of bodies being returned to the Earth from the Ark.<eos> This is what it looks like from the other side.<eos> They didn't get our message.<eos> - This is all because of you!<eos> - I helped you find the radio.<eos> Yeah, after you jacked it from my pod and trashed it!
We have much to celebrate. And know that you and your friends are welcome in our kingdom.<eos> If you need anything, we're at your service.<eos> Thank you, but all we need is horses.<eos> We have our own kingdom, our own castle.<eos> Our castle was destroyed in the curse.<eos> Well-played, Your Majesty. You laid waste to everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> Her castle still stands.<eos> Of course it does.<eos> I protected it.

It wasn't.<eos> My superpower may not be perfect, but with you, Regina, I always know when you're lying.<eos> This time, you're not.<eos> You didn't do it.<eos> Even though you know I can't live without him.<eos> There you go... telling the truth again.<eos> So, where are we headed?<eos> There's a fire in the courtyard that powers her spell.<eos> As long as it burns, the shield will stay up.<eos> Then we simply need to put it out.

You really don't know who I am, do you?<eos> I know exactly who you are... the Wicked Witch.<eos> Is that all?<eos> I'm not that interested.<eos> Please... allow me to introduce myself.<eos> You can call me Zelena.<eos> That's my dress. Mm.<eos> I had to take it in a little bit at the hips, but... looks better on me, don't you think?<eos> I think you never should have left Oz.<eos> You can have your castle back if you want it that badly.
I know you don't want me to spend my money on you...<eos> - You didn't ask me. - I know.<eos> - You didn't tell me.<eos> - But...<eos> Why should I tell you?<eos> You would've said no.<eos> - That's true.<eos> - Okay?<eos> I got the money.<eos> Why can't I spend it on my brother-in-law?
- Sure.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> I'm the manager, remember?<eos> We met when you paid me six months in advance?<eos> I mean, normally, I have to chase people just to get their last month's.<eos> And you really can't have glass bottles out here.<eos> It breaks, you gotta drain the whole pool.<eos> God...<eos> You are so drunk.<eos> _ My life wasn't bad enough already, you had to make it worse.
They're not going to find that out because I don't own five percent.<eos> Do I need to give you a tutorial on the procedure?<eos> You start by buying shares.<eos> I know what the procedure is, Harvey.<eos> Well, how many shares have you bought?<eos> None.<eos> This phrase, "I know what the procedure is"? I don't think it means what you think it means.<eos> Well, as inconceivable as it might be to you, Harvey,<eos> I'm actually not going in hostile.<eos> What are you talking about? I'm talking about approaching someone to buy their company in order to keep it alive instead of selling it for parts.
Mmm.<eos> I'll meet you there. I've got to, uh, just set up some meetings for tomorrow first.<eos> What about The Little Owl?<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> Mike, what are you doing here?<eos> You delivered a message, so, now I'm delivering one.<eos> Pearson Specter is formally in review.<eos> What did you just say to me?<eos> You want my business?<eos> You're going to have to earn it.
I do.<eos> Then, tonight is our last night.<eos> We'll see if you still think that in four hours.<eos> Oh, you want to go three times?<eos> No, I was including one of the movies.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You finally got yourself an office.<eos> Maybe you forgot but I had an office before.<eos> I just gave it back.
You cannot feel his love.<eos> Many of you suffer greatly. You feel that you're lost in a dark wilderness.<eos> But I tell you this...<eos> If you will put your trust in God and Jesus, and in me, then he will lead you to green pastures and your suffering will have ending.<eos> Hello again.<eos> Enjoy the service?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Very much.<eos> Will's off today... to France.<eos> So you'd better sort that wedding dress out, because you'll need it when I'm back.
Smugglers murdered him.<eos> So how is my brother?<eos> Did the Magistrate arrest him?<eos> You know he didn't, cos you've seen your brother since.<eos> In fact, the Magistrate was asking after you but I said I hadn't seen you.<eos> Ah! So you can do as you're told, then!<eos> I dare say if I'd thought about it, I'd have told him where you were.<eos> But seeing as I didn't, you can tell me what you've got to hide.<eos> Well, that horse belongs to the Magistrate, for one.<eos> I stole it from his trap last Thursday.
The dam was Irish bred.<eos> I wouldn't touch him if I were you.<eos> Where's your mark?<eos> You're sharp, aren't you?<eos> Anyone'd think I'd stolen him.<eos> It's a good thing for you that Tim Bray's gone to Dorset.<eos> I'd leave him before you land yourself in trouble.<eos> Lovely foal, sired by stallion...<eos> Look, this ribbon's perfect for my wedding gown. Mm.<eos> You'll need to finish it if Will gets home tomorrow.
He's absolutely perfect then!<eos> I'll pay your price - and extra for your disappointment.<eos> I gave my word on 25 guineas.<eos> I'll give you 30. I'm Mrs Bassat from North Hill.<eos> The Magistrate's my husband.<eos> Here, take the money.<eos> Then I hope that Mr Bassat will be pleased with your purchase.<eos> Of course he's really nothing like our Beauty - he was a thoroughbred and three or four hands higher - but he'll please the children.<eos> You should be hanged, Jem Merlyn.<eos> Selling a horse to the very woman you stole it from!
My husband owns a funeral home.<eos> What about you?<eos> What about me what?<eos> Can you find a dead man?<eos> Can you find more than one?<eos> So, you finally have the place to yourself?<eos> No more threat, no more need for backup.<eos> What will happen to the gold?<eos> Sit in a warehouse till Monroe gets convicted.<eos> Then we'll auction it.
Aches still, but...<eos> You try that hot dish?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Real good.<eos> Yeah. So, you know, kitty and I were talking, and we think you should move in here for a while.<eos> Just stay with us, you know, until you get the house cleaned up or sold.<eos> Why the heck would I sell the house?<eos> Oh.<eos> I'm not saying you have to go that way.<eos> Just, you know, stay a few days until we get it cleaned up.
- Let's find Doug.<eos> - Right away, sir.<eos> Forgive the plastic.<eos> Luc Tuymans.<eos> He's the real thing.<eos> Well, I'll take your word.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> None of it.<eos> California.<eos> You want to sell your house, your Realtor decorates it.
Hands up !<eos> Up !<eos> Keep your hands up.<eos> That's better.<eos> All right.<eos> You'll really go for more ?<eos> Look up. Point.<eos> Light travels almost 300.000 km/s.<eos> As far as we can tell nothing in the physical universe can go faster.<eos> But because light travels so fast and because its speed is constant we can use it to measure the incredible distances in the universe.
Those external costs are about 332 billion euros.<eos> If the dairy and meat industry would internalise these costs, if they had to bear the costs, the price of meat and dairy would skyrocket.<eos> A 5 euro carton of eggs would rise to 10 euros.<eos> A 3,50 euro Big Mac would rise to 8,85 euro.<eos> The problem with these external costs imposed on society is whether you eat meat or not whether you're an omnivore or an herbivore you pay the cost of someone else's consumption.<eos> When someone goes to McDonald's and buys a 3,50 euro Big Mac. the remaining 6,35 euro of costs are imposed on society.<eos> You and I are paying for that, whether you eat meat or not.<eos> FOOD WATER WATCH (Executive Director) When we look at who benefits and lobbies for this system of agriculture it's the largest food and meat producers in the country.<eos> And when they grow so large and wealthy they US Livestock Industry (Senate Agriculture Committee) can dictate policies on producing food. because they have so much political power.<eos> Was this why Al Gore, even as vice-president, never addressed the question of animal agriculture and never mentioned it his film "An Inconvenient Truth" or in his organisation the Climate Reality Project?
Think anyone should be consuming dairy?<eos> I really don't.<eos> When you think about it, the purpose of cows' milk--<eos> I grew on a dairy farm in Wisconsin.<eos> The purpose of cows' milk is to turn a 65-pound calf into a 200 kilo cow as rapidly as possible.<eos> Cows' milk is baby-calf growth fluid.<eos> It's what the stuff is.<eos> Everything in that white liquid, the hormones, the lipids, the proteins the sodium, the growth factors, the IGF Everything in that white liquid, the hormones, the lipids, the proteins the sodium, the growth factors, the IGF<eos> every one of those is meant to blow the calf up to a great big cow or it wouldn't be there.<eos> And whether you pour it on your cereals as a liquid whether you clot it into yogurt whether you ferment it into cheese whether you freeze it into ice cream it's baby-calf growth fluid.
Beautiful boy.<eos> Are you grumpy, huh?<eos> I'll take him for a drive.<eos> Let me take him.<eos> - Do you want me to come?<eos> - No, get some sleep.<eos> I'll find your pacifier.<eos> There you go. There now.<eos> We'll just go for a drive, and you'll fall asleep.<eos> The child is not malnourished, it's healthy, so we can't remove it.
No, I didn't expect you to be.<eos> Why not? What?<eos> Why shouldn't I be sitting at home feeling sorry for myself?<eos> I-I didn't say that. You know what I keep hearing?<eos> How civilized this breakup is, how great I'm doing.<eos> Well, it's all poppycock. AnnaBeth, you sound a little angry.<eos> I am angry.<eos> And sad.<eos> And it's all your fault.<eos> And you should know that because I gave you my heart and you used it like a dishrag.
Try to think of it less as a hand over and more as a hand off.<eos> You've done your part.<eos> Now we'll do ours.<eos> If everything goes as planned, Cybertek's security team won't even know we were on the train.<eos> So we're going in undercover.<eos> I hate undercover.<eos> May and Ward, you're front and center.<eos> Once we locate the package, you'll tag it with a tracker.<eos> Skye and Fitz, you'll be running communications.<eos> After the package is tagged, we'll follow it to Quinn.
Yes, sir, though it looks like you could use some lip balm, sir.<eos> Should've taken that desk job in Miami.<eos> It is cold!<eos> Captain's on the bridge!<eos> XO Slattery, let's see if we can get your frozen ass back to Norfolk.<eos> - TAO, Bridge.<eos> - Bridge, TAO.<eos> Our Helo just dropped a target for our final missile test.<eos> Target's five feet long, two feet wide, and in the icy water has no heat signature.<eos> Let's find it and kill it.
There's still no answer from POTUS and nothing from Mayport or the lab.<eos> We can't even get an FM radio signal.<eos> If the power grid's down, that means everything's down.<eos> We'll know more when we get boots on the ground.<eos> Mike, we're not going home.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The lab's 200 miles inland.<eos> You saw the news footage.<eos> We'll fight our way in there if we have to. And then what?<eos> Generators run out in a couple weeks, maybe the civilian population tries to overrun it.
- Well, this isn't comforting at all.<eos> Let me say, I'm glad we're not wearing uniforms.<eos> They're looking for warriors, you'd kind of be at the top of the list.<eos> That's good.<eos> At least, I think it's good.<eos> Wish I could get your opinion.<eos> Hey, if it tastes right to you, I'm sure it's, you know, good to go.<eos> Hey, I want to show you something.<eos> - Oh, family crest? - Yep.<eos> My grandparents gave it to me when I graduated from college.
I don't want anybody interfering with you.<eos> You take all the men you need, and get it done.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - All right, go.<eos> Yeah?<eos> When is that azithromycin<eos> - getting here?<eos> - Three days.<eos> I don't have three days.<eos> I can't exactly FedEx it, Gene.
Priscilla.<eos> I, uh, think you better come with me.<eos> Not so easy to kill, am I?<eos> Gene's infected.<eos> You infected him.<eos> You got it all wrong.<eos> Where's the antidote?<eos> Gene got sick trying to save the good people of Willoughby.<eos> If he dies, he'll die a hero.<eos> Taking it out on me won't do any good.
Wingman is trying to escape G.I. Joe, and it's up to you to hold him back with your inner child's hand.<eos> Damn it, I didn't make it.<eos> I'm not controlling him!<eos> He's doing this himself!<eos> Screw you, kid!<eos> Ow! He burnt my hand.<eos> The Wingman wingpack is not available in stores.<eos> You control the toy.<eos> You control it, my ass.<eos> - What is it doing?
On the bright side, you don't have to pick me up anymore.<eos> How can you make a joke about this?<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> The principal said I'm lucky she didn't call the cops.<eos> - Why did you have a knife?<eos> - It was a box cutter.<eos> A what?<eos> I told you I work after school.<eos> I cut open boxes at a grocery store.<eos> I must have left it in my bag.

Yeah.<eos> Hey!<eos> You still want that letter of recommendation?<eos> Whatever.<eos> They're right.<eos> My new work sucks.<eos> I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.<eos> One minute they're holding you up like you're some sort of a goddess. The next, they don't even know how to spell your name right.<eos> I like your stuff.<eos> You like it 'cause you want something.
You get to blackmail senators.<eos> How long before you start robbing banks?<eos> You know what...<eos> I'm really sorry about what happened over the summer.<eos> But I've done everything I can to make up for it.<eos> And the only reason I got in a fight in the first place was because I was totally obsessed with trying to make this team work.<eos> And I probably lost a friend over it. And why?<eos> So that you would go to a game, and for the first time in a month, look at me like I wasn't a total disappointment.<eos> Yeah, this whole dumb field hockey experiment was for you.<eos> But you're never going to let it go. So just do whatever you want.
I love it.<eos> But save the Patti Smith stuff for the work.<eos> Trust me on this one.<eos> Take the letter.<eos> Okay, good call.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> According to my assistant, I was a bit of a sociopath yesterday.<eos> So she bought me some flowers.<eos> Look, I'm not great with people.<eos> But I'm smart, I pay well, and I know talent when I see it.
GPS says we're close.<eos> Now's probably a good time to ask how we're gonna find Katrina once we get in there.<eos> Your ancestors' church - Grace and Joseph.<eos> Katrina said she visits the "echo" of that church every day.<eos> And I light a candle in memoriam and I pray for his soul.<eos> On the bright side, at least we'll get to experience life after death within our lifetime.<eos> That is a pretty dark bright side.<eos> You must not take this lightly.<eos> Purgatory is a maze of temptation.<eos> If you are offered food or drink, you must not accept it.
Oh, you missed a...<eos> I wish we had some soy milk.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yes, seriously.<eos> Have you ever tried it?<eos> My best friend in third grade,<eos> - he was allergic to dairy.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> And every day he would bring this soy stuff to lunch.<eos> - I tried it.
Shut the hell up.<eos> I'm trying to sleep.<eos> There's a woman shacking up in here.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - Come on down.<eos> - She hot?<eos> - Don't grab your pecker just yet.<eos> What the hell you hollering about?<eos> Found her shirt.<eos> Must have washed it this morning.
- Come on down.<eos> - She hot?<eos> - Don't grab your pecker just yet.<eos> What the hell you hollering about?<eos> Found her shirt.<eos> Must have washed it this morning.<eos> - Smells good.<eos> - Oh, you found a shirt?<eos> She could be miles away by now.<eos> Why'd she go to all the trouble of washing a shirt when she's just gonna ditch it?
But you're wrong.<eos> So why are you here?<eos> 'Cause I was waiting for you.<eos> I'm not giving up.<eos> But I need your help.<eos> 'Cause I can't do it by myself.<eos> And even if I catch up to Bob, we can't do it alone.<eos> I thought that I couldn't ask you to risk your life.<eos> But I can.<eos> 'Cause I know what you'd be risking it for.
What do you mean?<eos> You haven't seen it?<eos> How she's confused about them, the walkers.<eos> She doesn't see what they are.<eos> She thinks they're just different.<eos> Mica the same way?<eos> No, she's worse.<eos> She doesn't have a mean bone in her body.<eos> Did "Tom Sawyer" have a happy ending?<eos> We never got to finish it.
I didn't say that.<eos> You didn't have to.<eos> Ali, what are you doing?<eos> I can't find it.<eos> - You can't find what?<eos> - I can't find my phone.<eos> - It's the middle of the night.<eos> - It's important.<eos> It goes off at 8:00... and it asks me these questions.<eos> I have to find it.

One bladder.<eos> Three kidneys-- two on the left and one on the right.<eos> Nurse?<eos> Are you writing this down?<eos> Yes, Doctor.<eos> Four lungs.<eos> Two hearts with a shared circulatory system.<eos> "The victim, 63-year old "Eudora Tattler, was thought "by neighbors to have lived alone.<eos> "The unfortunate creature discovered at the crime scene, "who witnesses are describing as 'monstrously deformed,' may be a relation, sources say."<eos> I don't blame the old lady for keeping it hidden.
Fresh flowers for tomb, 2,000 pesetas.<eos> For baby.<eos> Have you got 2,000 pesetas, kid?<eos> I can't even look at it!<eos> Let's go, I can't be here.<eos> Come on, Torrente.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Where do you want to go now?<eos> I want to get my car back.<eos> I left it with Peladilla to watch it.

A collector's edition.<eos> A tuned-UP machine!<eos> There's a man living in your car.<eos> - It's a black guy!<eos> as the night.<eos> Is nothing sacred in this country?<eos> Nobody respects anything!<eos> No!<eos> Damn you!<eos> You destroyed it!
Amparito!<eos> Hey, Torrente!<eos> Long time no see.<eos> You look great!<eos> And that's not a line.<eos> You look great!<eos> What brings you here?<eos> Thanks to your aunt Reme's kindness and hospitality, she said we could stay here while my place is getting remodeled.<eos> Your place?<eos> I thought the bank took it away.
- Leave one for me at least.<eos> Thanks!<eos> Ready?<eos> ROBBERY D DAY<eos> Room 141 isn't available.<eos> I'm sorry, but the room you booked isn't room 141, it's room 114.<eos> I may have made a mistake.<eos> But we want room 141.<eos> Yes, Miss, but room 141 is occupied.<eos> Then unoccupy it.
Torrente, we have a tiny little problem.<eos> We didn't get the room.<eos> Torrente!<eos> Take it easy, Marshall.<eos> I have to stay on top of these guys to get things right.<eos> I'll just have to send Cuco to supervise the explosives.<eos> But that's okay, he's completely reliable.<eos> Careful, here it comes!<eos> We have to do this with pinpoint accuracy.<eos> That stuff blows up just looking at it.
You should have come!<eos> Sweetie, I hate flying.<eos> I'm just fine here at the Parador in Toledo.<eos> I see you made a little friend!<eos> This guy?<eos> He's the stud I rented on the Internet.<eos> He's a bit Gothic, but he does crazy shit to me.<eos> What I don't understand is how you changed the bags without anyone noticing.<eos> When Ricardito said he didn't trust the American and asked me to help him, I didn't think twice.<eos> Grab the money and we'll take it to a tax haven.
What I don't understand is how you changed the bags without anyone noticing.<eos> When Ricardito said he didn't trust the American and asked me to help him, I didn't think twice.<eos> Grab the money and we'll take it to a tax haven.<eos> That morning Ricardito prepared the bags with the fake money and left them in the container by the sewer.<eos> Since he came out first, he quickly changed them.<eos> Then I went back for the bags with the real money.<eos> My baby is so smart!<eos> I imagine Mr. Torrente and the boys will come back for their share.<eos> Of course.<eos> That's why we're spending it as fast as we can, right, honey?
I can hold you here for 24 hours on suspicion of being suspicious if I want.<eos> I suggest you get comfortable.<eos> I'm not the one who went all bitch in there.<eos> You screamed like one.<eos> Fuck you. At least I didn't stand there pissing my pants.<eos> Blow me.<eos> You're gonna wanna... shut that door.<eos> Now, from the look of you sorry sons of bitches, I'm guessing it didn't go well.<eos> Now...<eos> Unless you have my money shoved up your bungholes, I going to assume that you weren't able to retrieve it.
I'm sure I've got a reference from her somewhere.<eos> But that was quite a while back, wasn't it?<eos> Well, she's made extra work for everyone.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> What do you mean, you need to tell me something before Barrow does?<eos> Mr Barrow wants to tell you about something in my past, m'lady.<eos> I've a secret, you see. A bad secret.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What secret?<eos> How does he know it?
Do you work in the school?<eos> I teach mathematics, handwriting and spelling, mainly.<eos> You must be so clever. I wouldn't say that.<eos> Come and meet the others. Goodbye.<eos> That's such a different path.<eos> It is, but it doesn't mean it's better than the one you've chosen.<eos> Your Ladyship, might I have a word?<eos> I'm very sorry to say it, but I've learned something that makes me feel both responsible and guilty.<eos> Would this have to do with Baxter?<eos> Because, if it concerns her criminal record, then I know all about it.
And anything we do that looks like a failure to cooperate amplifies that perception.<eos> I just don't want our marriage put on display.<eos> Look, Dunbar'll ask if I brought up China.<eos> I didn't. So Larkin can only help to exonerate me.<eos> And if the marriage counseling ends up in the report, so be it.<eos> We can survive that.<eos> But he prescribed us medication.<eos> Technically not us.<eos> You took mine, Garrett. Larkin wrote the prescription to me knowing you would.<eos> Wait, wait, have you mentioned it?
- OK, good.<eos> - Think it was just a panic attack,<eos> - or was she really trying--<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It was bad enough they felt they had to keep her overnight.<eos> I'm gonna call the White House physician's office,<eos> - see if they can recommend anyone.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Oh, wait, my phone.<eos> - It's in your hand.
- [woman] Excuse me?<eos> - [lawyer] My client reserves the--<eos> He knew.<eos> Isn't that what you're all wondering?<eos> [crowd murmuring] - [man] Quiet, please.<eos> - [woman] Knew what, exactly?<eos> There was a mechanism by which a great many contributions were made over the last ten years.<eos> The legality of this mechanism is something I continue to believe is within the boundaries of the law.<eos> [Raymond on TV] But as for the mechanism itself, Mr. Feng is correct.<eos> I orchestrated it, I facilitated it, and the President knew about it.
Oh, God.<eos> No!<eos> Bird!<eos> Aah!<eos> Oh, no! Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> What is that smell? !<eos> It smells like French fries!<eos> It's biodiesel.<eos> Can you plug it up?
Stop.<eos> And it's possible I come on a little too strong.<eos> No. No, no.<eos> I like to think that I'm greener than I am, but maybe I just want the credit without doing all the hard work that you do.<eos> Well, you're right -- it is hard, but, you know, it's also alienating.<eos> You know, no one wants to be friends with me.<eos> I-I can't tell you the last time I had people over for dinner, which is probably a good thing.<eos> You know, with solar power, it takes four days to roast a chicken.<eos> - Really?<eos> - If you want it cooked all the way through, yeah.
She's trembling.<eos> Your jacket, Elijah.<eos> She's not breathing.<eos> I can hear the baby's heartbeat but not hers.<eos> I suppose I'm family.<eos> In the beginning was the word. And the word was with God.<eos> He was with God in the beginning. In him was life.<eos> And that life was the light of all mankind.<eos> The light shines in the darkness.<eos> And the darkness has not overcome it.
Thierry's place.<eos> You see?<eos> That wasn't so hard, now, was it?<eos> What about Josh?<eos> Well, he'll live another 24 hours or so. I may need you, and Joshua serves as wonderful leverage.<eos> The next time I ask a question, answer quicker.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> I didn't realize my uncle even had this place until a read about it in his will.<eos> This building has been in my family for decades.<eos> You uncle helped us raise the funds to restore it after Katrina.
To be reborn, we must sacrifice.<eos> What the hell does that mean, you psychotic, little bitch?<eos> The ancestors demand an offering in exchange for power.<eos> And you child will be a fine offering.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You will not take my baby.<eos> I will kill all of you.<eos> No, you won't, and neither will Klaus or Elijah.<eos> When your baby is born, we will offer it up to those who came before us.
It was the ancestors' decree.<eos> It was her decree.<eos> It was whose decree?<eos> I'm surprised you have to ask.<eos> After all, you were the one who convinced your siblings to consecrate her in New Orleans soil.<eos> Esther.<eos> So not even death can stop my mother from seeking the annihilation of her own flesh and blood.<eos> This isn't the end.<eos> As long as that child lives, the witches of New Orleans will never stop coming for it.<eos> Esther will never stop coming for it.
Just before they attacked Nick.<eos> So now they know you're friends with a Grimm and you want to marry a Fuchsbau.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess you could say I'm a disappointment.<eos> Jackson quarry dispatch from officer Mart.<eos> Jackson quarry, officer Mart.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm investigating a fire, 2.7 Miles up road 43b.<eos> Is the fire contained? Appears to be.<eos> I'm gonna check it out.
You're still working on that memory thing.<eos> Not just memory.<eos> It's more of a friend.<eos> Maybe one day, this guy will watch over you, learn from you... protect you.<eos> Well, if anyone can do it, it's you.<eos> The world spins on dreamers like you, Harold.<eos> Yeah, I should change, shouldn't I?<eos> You know, I'm gonna tell everybody at The Pines my son is changing the world.<eos> Why does Control want the drives to a broken program?<eos> The program's only broken until somebody smart fixes it.
All you need to do is give me your username and password.<eos> All of this could stop.<eos> Did I say something funny?<eos> You're asking all the wrong questions.<eos> I... am the interface.<eos> If you want to talk to her... just give me a phone.<eos> Will this do?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm- - I'm a bit tied up.<eos> You're not gonna get it just yet.
_ If they don't want to let people inside, they ought to build it better.<eos> Alive?<eos> It's not alive, Arthur.<eos> The project broke me, but humans are broken from the moment of conception.<eos> Mutations, defects-- it's all so wonderful.<eos> The chance of disaster.<eos> We fail, we learn, we fail.<eos> My program was too perfect.<eos> You're talking about evolutionary algorithms, genetic programming.<eos> That day, Harold, I broke it.

Pluto was a planet. Some committee of fancy assholes disagree. I disagree back.<eos> Give me a ping-pong ball.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> I-I just have to...<eos> Go find Rick and go over my head about Pluto?<eos> No. Geez, I just got to go to the bathroom. Damn.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> This is gonna be fun.<eos> Hey, Morty, let me ask you a question real quick.<eos> Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it? Um...
How could I not see this coming?<eos> My lust!<eos> My greed!<eos> I deserved this! I deserved this!<eos> This serum should counteract the negative effects.<eos> Holy cats!<eos> Ladies, let's get out of here.<eos> I haven't learned a thing!<eos> Here. You can have this back.<eos> You didn't use it?
My greed!<eos> I deserved this! I deserved this!<eos> This serum should counteract the negative effects.<eos> Holy cats!<eos> Ladies, let's get out of here.<eos> I haven't learned a thing!<eos> Here. You can have this back.<eos> You didn't use it?<eos> Sure I did -- to develop this.<eos> It detects and catalogs all your "twilight zone", "ray bradbury", "Friday the 13th" the series voodoo crap magic.
What'd they steal?<eos> Some high-tech gizmo.<eos> Kord rep called it a, um, skeleton key.<eos> What? You know what it is?<eos> It was intended as a military tool to aid in code breaking on foreign intelligence targets.<eos> Felicity Smoak works at Queen Consolidated and she said they were working on something similar... But Oliver Queen shut it down once he realized what it could be used for.<eos> What?<eos> It could be modified to open a bank vault. Any bank vault.<eos> Ok, listen-- Walczak's small-time on a good day.<eos> I mean, I doubt he'd even know how to use this thing, let alone break into a place like Kord and steal it on his own.
Felicity, can I use your computer?<eos> Macgregor's Syndrome. It's a genetic defect that creates fluid build-up in the lungs, which leads to oxygen deprivation and multi system organ failure.<eos> It's terminal.<eos> But the syndrome may give us a way to ID him.<eos> People with Macgregor's are extremely rare, and people with Macgregor's and a degree in computer science are even more rare. William Tockman.<eos> Former encryption engineer at, wait for it-- Kord Enterprises.<eos> What's the point?<eos> He'll be dead before he can spend all the money.<eos> He's not stealing the money for himself.<eos> He's using it for his family.
Well, look, I mean, it can cure, I don't know, maybe anything.<eos> Maybe... Maybe it's a miracle drug.<eos> But it's also something else.<eos> Something that people like Ivo should never be allowed to control.<eos> What about Slade?<eos> He might not let us.<eos> Might not let you do what?<eos> You think we should destroy the Mirakuru?<eos> This thing doesn't go our way...<eos> We can't let Ivo have it.

Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.<eos> But you're a very lucky girl to have known such privilege.<eos> And I am fortunate to have your entire family here.<eos> Oliver.<eos> Oliver, what's your name?<eos> Oliver Jonas Queen.<eos> Oliver, where were you born?<eos> Starling City.<eos> Why did you build a bonfire on the beach?<eos> So you'd see it.
Well, I have my allies, just as you have yours.<eos> John Diggle, for example.<eos> I suppose you're wondering why he hasn't taken his head shot.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He's still alive... for now.<eos> Slade.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Five years ago, I made you a promise.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Well, I'm here to fulfill it.
Nothing in this business is simple.<eos> You know that, Mr. Diggle.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I don't need you to get the nerve agent out.<eos> I need you to get your team in.<eos> My team?<eos> They're designated "Task Force X."<eos> Give me a break.<eos> This ain't no task force.<eos> Let's call it like it is--
I wouldn't know.<eos> Everything I make beyond expenses goes in a blind trust.<eos> A girl needs her father.<eos> Nah, not this father.<eos> Best thing I can do for her life... Not be in it.<eos> Is it ready?<eos> You know, we went through all that trouble to get Johnny here invited to this little shindig.<eos> Seems like an awful waste not to use that invitation.<eos> You're using it.<eos> Once you have hands on the nerve agent, pocket it, walk right on out.
Let him come.<eos> I'm not the girl he knew on the island.<eos> I'm not that easy to kill.<eos> Together?<eos> Together.<eos> I'm in.<eos> I'll have the nerve agent in my pocket in 30 seconds.<eos> Harbinger...<eos> We've got what I would describe as a little bit of a situation here.<eos> Explain. Well, I got eyes on the nerve agent, and I'm not going to be able to move it, much less pocket it.
Diggle, stay back!<eos> You're wasting your bullets.<eos> Don't forget who taught you how to fight, kid.<eos> Excuse me, I'm looking for my sister, Sara Lance.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm Laurel Lance.<eos> Is my sister ok?<eos> Oh, she'll be fine.<eos> Just a hairline fracture of her wrist.<eos> We set it.
We need to keep what's in him from getting out. What do we do now?<eos> The only thing we can do--we wait.<eos> Well, while we're waiting, we still have a Slade problem.<eos> He's got 20 guys just like him, and we have no way to stop him.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> Mirakuru.<eos> You weren't thinking about taking it, were you?<eos> No.<eos> We're going to use it to make a cure.
It is if it costs me you.<eos> Your lies did that.<eos> Now, I'm going to go upstairs to the stock room, and if I get attacked by some shot glasses, I'll call 911.<eos> Thanks for taking care of her.<eos> Lucky for me, she's not as good at disappearing as you were.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Have you seen Thea?<eos> What happened to your eye?<eos> It's ok.<eos> I could cover it with make-up.
That should buy her something.<eos> A second chance, maybe.<eos> ...A citywide man hunt for the perpetrator of an attack that left one police officer seriously injured and the other dead.<eos> We have video shot by a bystander, but please be warned that the footage may be too graphic for some viewers.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Thea...<eos> I have to go see a friend.<eos> If you have to follow, follow.<eos> These aren't going to fix your knee.<eos> They'll help it heal faster. And until then?
Whoever did this to her is going to suffer.<eos> You cannot die until you have known... Complete despair.<eos> And you will.<eos> I promise.<eos> A new player we've been tracking.<eos> We've been calling him Deathstroke.<eos> Slade's goal is to create army of human weapons using the Mirakuru.<eos> I can't stop him from doing anything.<eos> Five years ago, I made you a promise.<eos> I'm here to fulfill it.
Hangs with a local gang.<eos> Huh. Kono, you see something?<eos> Yeah, his tat.<eos> Um, Malia's brother just got the same exact one.<eos> Gabriel?<eos> Yeah. Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, we were surfing Rock Piles yesterday, I saw it.<eos> That's a gang tattoo.<eos> Could be Gabriel was recently initiated.<eos> Question is: what did he do to earn it?
I'm gonna cut these ropes.<eos> Where's your mom?<eos> Some guy took her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where?<eos> Do you see where we are?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Now, what I want you to do is real simple.<eos> Just walk into the bank like you're a normal customer, get my money from your husband's safety-deposit box, and bring it back to me.
Now, what I want you to do is real simple.<eos> Just walk into the bank like you're a normal customer, get my money from your husband's safety-deposit box, and bring it back to me.<eos> It's easy, right?<eos> If there's a penny less than the $2 million your husband stole from me, I will call my friends and your son dies, you understand?<eos> I understand.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> You open your mouth to anyone-- the bank guards, a teller, even the guy you're standing behind in line and your son will look just like that.<eos> So, according to Mrs. Koi, she went into the bank, took the money from the safety-deposit box.<eos> That's what we learned as well.<eos> But before she could return it to Gabriel, he was confronted by the police. Yeah.
I'm Malia.<eos> I'm Chin Ho Kelly.<eos> So... what do you do, Chin Ho Kelly?<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> Uh, I'm gonna be a cop.<eos> I'm in the academy.<eos> I'll bet you'll look really cute in uniform.<eos> So, can I have my board back now?<eos> Not unless you let me take you to dinner.<eos> You can keep it.
You want another one?<eos> Hi. I'm Lani Richardson, reporting for KNZR in Honolulu, Hawaii.<eos> You know, it's not all gloom and doom.<eos> We actually have some good news.<eos> Tonight, patrol officers in the HPD are a little bit safer thanks to the generosity of an anonymous Good Samaritan who has donated 100 new bulletproof vests to the department through the Honolulu Police Foundation.<eos> Mayor Kirk Caldwell says...<eos> You just love giving your money away, don't you?<eos> I can't take it with me.
You and me-- we ain't there, yet.<eos> Hold up, hold up, h-hold up.<eos> These are fresh.<eos> He can't be more than ten or 15 minutes ahead of us.<eos> Hello.<eos> How you doing? Can I help you?<eos> Uh, yeah, I'm, uh, Detective Williams with Five-O.<eos> Um, just need to ask you, do you have a rifle on board?<eos> We do.<eos> We use it when we go shark fishing.
I found a few girls he might have a shot with.<eos> Happen to know what Lisa Nagel's like from the neck down?<eos> - I didn't tell him what you told me to say.<eos> - What? Why?<eos> Because he told me what he's going to do when Amy comes here, and it's beautiful.<eos> I think he has a better chance than you think.<eos> He knows how to talk to girls.<eos> He knows how to talk to a girl- you.<eos> I hope you have a recent picture of his heart.<eos> You're gonna need it, putting the pieces back together.
What's your point?<eos> You are a hero, Raylan.<eos> I met enough LEOs to know.<eos> I can tell you're a man that would run into a burning building without blinking an eye.<eos> Thing is, I... I think you're the one setting the fire.<eos> Well, you just can't get enough of us, can you?<eos> Well, my mama was a redhead.<eos> Let's just say I have an affinity.<eos> You interested in growing that stack?<eos> Why, you gonna offer to help us invest it or something?
- How is the car?<eos> -Totaled.<eos> But that isn't the worst of it.<eos> The kilo was totaled too.<eos> No way!<eos> The capsule was dented and the bell jars were smashed.<eos> What about the kilo itself?<eos> It...<eos> It seems fine.<eos> I have to go back to Paris, and try to get it fixed before anyone finds out.
I'm here to help!<eos> I'm Henry by the way.<eos> Hello.<eos> Do you have an appointment?<eos> - No. Dr. Weihe sent me.<eos> - He's doing better?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sorry...<eos> Can I ask what you do?<eos> We have a talent and we try to use it to help.
You might want to inform your boss.<eos> He's dealing with an emergency situation.<eos> What emergency situation could possibly be more pressing than this outbreak?<eos> He'll be back when he's finished, and no one is going down to Level R no one in, no one out. That includes Dr. Walker.<eos> You're gonna shoot me, Daniel?<eos> Is that really your play here?<eos> You need to get back to your lab.<eos> I don't work for you!<eos> Do you have any idea what this thing is?<eos> What it's doing to people?
I can't believe I didn't see it before. How could you have?<eos> We weren't looking for it.<eos> He's using the virus as a delivery mechanism.<eos> The question is: what's the virus bringing to the party?<eos> And why?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> - Dr. Farragut.<eos> - What's in the virus?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - I saw it with my own eyes.
- Especially when we're already - cleaning up their mess for free.<eos> - Big pharma.<eos> You know they're only interested in the bottom line.<eos> - They don't really want to help people.<eos> - And who knows how far they'll go to protect their investment?<eos> We can't stop working on a cure.<eos> No, too many lives at stake.<eos> But we do not work for Sutton.<eos> We keep the cure from her.<eos> We may need it.
It's just a scratch.<eos> Can't say the same for the radio.<eos> It's pretty busted up, but I think I can fix it.<eos> Since when?<eos> I've had to learn to do a lot of things without you.<eos> It's chilly in here, but it's downright subzero between you two.<eos> Battery's toast.<eos> We're gonna need another power source.<eos> This place must have had a backup generator.<eos> I'll see if I can find it.
I was wondering when you were gonna say something.<eos> Trying to give you some time.<eos> For what?<eos> This is our home.<eos> We shouldn't be running from it.<eos> I learned at a very young age that you gotta build a home out of people, not places.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And where's your home, Sergio?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I haven't found it yet.
Can I help you?<eos> Do you have to live your sexuality just now?<eos> That's something teenager do.<eos> Do you think so?<eos> You are such an amazing family.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Is it possible to love two people?<eos> That's not the point.<eos> And... what's with your house?<eos> We build it together with our neighbours.
There is a... there is a ma...<eos> You make mistakes.<eos> Happy birthday to my best work friend.<eos> Tina, if you see this, I'm sorry.<eos> I just feel like we drifted apart after Jeremy's cocaine thing.<eos> It was awkward. "When the stirrups of life start to feel like the speculum of old age..." Nick, I'm not reading this.<eos> Happy birthday, Jess.<eos> Your boyfriend is sweet and simple and will not get out of my waiting room.<eos> I saw a squirrel once.<eos> It looked like Jess. Then it attacked my sister, So I had to beat it with a stick, and then it didn't look like Jess anymore.
Your mother spoke very highly of you, Killian.<eos> That's surprising to hear.<eos> Actually, I'm just being polite...<eos> She rarely spoke of either of you.<eos> Anyway, she wanted me to give you this.<eos> The will is inside here?<eos> To be honest, I don't know what's inside.<eos> She left me strict instructions to deliver it upon her death, but only when the two of you were together.<eos> What are we supposed to do?<eos> Just a shot in the dark here, but I'd say... open it.
- Thanks, Mr. Shane.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> I'll send you a bill.<eos> Of course.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ready to see our inheritance?<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Looks like... Some sort of ancient lockbox.<eos> It's a puzzle.<eos> We're supposed to solve it.
Sweetheart, where are you?<eos> Can you please come home.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I just want to see you.<eos> I want to talk, okay?<eos> Call me.<eos> If I had listened to the signs, this never would've happened.<eos> I was selfish.<eos> And I altered your true fate.<eos> And I will make it right.
Benaroche.<eos> Knock before entering and give me your note.<eos> Don't do my head in.<eos> Pretend I'm not here. - I'll call you back.<eos> - Your mobile!<eos> I've put in on silent.<eos> Continue your thing.<eos> If you'd been on time, Benaroche, you'd have heard my thing is Baudelaire.<eos> - Charles Baudelaire. - Yes. Baudelaire.<eos> I sent it to ten publishers, and so far four have turned me down.
You won't get sent to prison.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I'm asking you. Just say yes or no.<eos> The answer is no.<eos> - Think about it.<eos> - I said no. - Think some more.<eos> - I've thought enough.<eos> I never spoke to you.<eos> This conversation never happened.<eos> I'd rather forget it too.
Yes, I have your address. See you soon.<eos> - Bad news?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> Goodbye, Doctor.<eos> It was great.<eos> Great!<eos> I've read your manuscript, The Peppercorn.<eos> It's original, but way out there.<eos> It lacks dramatic effect, there 40 incomprehensible pages, it's full of spelling mistakes.<eos> How many publishers have you sent it to?
I'll read it to you.<eos> Do you have 30 minutes?<eos> "If you assume "everything has a meaning, "the fact the human body has two of every organ,<eos> "is no coincidence. "We have two eyes, two upper and lower limbs.<eos> "This binomy is..."<eos> Binomy.<eos> The word doesn't exist.<eos> Who cares!<eos> I know it doesn't exist.<eos> I invented it so the reader would understand me better. That's the reason.
Okay.<eos> Got that photo you wanted, Sar.<eos> The car that was following Adrian from school, I blew it up like you requested.<eos> I was able to get a partial plate. You want me to run it?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, we found Adrian.<eos> There's no need. Okay.<eos> Well, if you change your mind...<eos> I'll take that photo.<eos> You can leave it with me.
I haven't the faintest idea.<eos> So, that's it, then?<eos> They're dead.<eos> You killed my family.<eos> No, you killed your family!<eos> You killed them, and two of my best men the minute you took up with Ruskov!<eos> I had no choice!<eos> You always have a choice!<eos> You could have asked for help!<eos> Instead, you took the fate of the entire world in your hands, and you almost threw it away!
This is ridiculous.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Ah, damn it!<eos> Damn it! Elva!<eos> Elva, this is ridiculous.<eos> You didn't get her, did you?<eos> No.<eos> I thought we were all dead.<eos> How bad is the ship?<eos> We'll fix it.
Yep.<eos> Are you sure I shouldn't try to move my trip to New York?<eos> Don't you have the meeting with Renzo's publisher friend?<eos> I mean, you don't wanna flake out on her.<eos> Yeah, but I... you've been so excited about this.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I am excited.<eos> I think I finally have an idea with a hook.<eos> I can really see myself selling that book.<eos> And I could see it on the shelves, and I... I can see I'm...
- Baby...<eos> Let's go.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just drama. It's cool.<eos> (Changing radio stations)<eos> Is that a bruise?<eos> It's from field hockey.<eos> I forgot my damn lunch.<eos> Do you wanna go back and get it?
Thank you.<eos> Hey, Nik, it's me, uh, again.<eos> So, I guess just call me back whenever you get this.<eos> Hey!<eos> Cool pad, bro.<eos> A cactus?<eos> It's a succulent.<eos> I don't really know what that means.<eos> It was between this or place-mats.<eos> You don't have to water it, like, ever.
Party at my place.<eos> So good.<eos> - You guys did so great!<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Uh, I need to borrow your car.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> I lent mine to Sharee.<eos> You did what?<eos> She really needed it.
I don't know.<eos> I picked her up this morning, and her mom's boyfriend came storming out of the house.<eos> And I saw a bruise.<eos> Okay, I'm coming with you.<eos> Hey!<eos> It's the half-pint hero.<eos> In the flesh.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We had to stop for some supplies.<eos> These guys are incapable of hearing the word "party" and not immediately pairing it with "malt liquor."

Well, as long as you don't serve it to those in high school,
What race of man was ever so glorious that they filled our world with such, as you say, indescribable beauty?<eos> I have been told, sire, that you served at the court of the emperor Charlemagne, which I have also visited.<eos> I cannot imagine, therefore, that you do not know what I know.<eos> That these images were painted by the Romans.<eos> They conquered these lands a long time ago.<eos> They conquered the whole world.<eos> But they were pagans.<eos> They worshipped false gods.<eos> Never speak of our conversation to any other man here.<eos> Nobody else would understand it.
Where he was last seen. Oh!<eos> Maggie tracked him here.<eos> - Now we follow his trail, yes?<eos> - Oh, no, no, no. You are staying in the car.<eos> Don't cause any trouble.<eos> Can I have radio?<eos> No, Helena, just don't do anything, please.<eos> Can I help you with anything?<eos> What is this place?<eos> I've seen it before.
- Do you know what Dyad's done to her?<eos> - What she's become? - That wasn't us.<eos> It wasn't even Dyad.<eos> It was the Neolutionists inside Dyad.<eos> Dr Leekie.<eos> - I don't have to talk to you.<eos> - Yes, you do, and you know it!<eos> It's all in the past.<eos> No, it's not! This is my life!<eos> And you gave it to me, so you're going to help us!
Cool, huh?<eos> Can we read another? Mmm-hmm.<eos> Whatcha got?<eos> Whoa.<eos> The island of dr.<eos> Moreau. It's about a man who makes monsters.<eos> -I know, I love this book.<eos> -It's special.<eos> Where did you get this book?<eos> Professor duncan gave it to me for a present.
- Uh... ok.<eos> Um, your energy was really good.<eos> The songs are good, but, um, I don't know.<eos> I don't think they were being articulated as well as they could be, I guess.<eos> I know we're not as tight as middle school honors band.<eos> You guys used to play together?<eos> Yeah, in seventh grade.<eos> Well, then, you know that Brandon is a seriously great pianist.<eos> Like, seriously great.<eos> Like, even when I'm so sick of hearing him practice the same thing over and over again, that I think if I hear it one more time I might puncture my own eardrum, I can step back and recognize that it's actually pretty amazing.
Over there on the meat crew.<eos> Dax... you're up.<eos> Where's my mom?<eos> You can see her after you and I have a little talk.<eos> Are you alone?<eos> Why?<eos> If I remember right, you beat a man to death.<eos> He stole from me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I have a problem, and I think you can help me fix it, and in return, I can guarantee your mom a spot on the first dropship and for you a choice assignment when I get to the ground.
Don't you know?<eos> Life is a fight.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Live, breathe, suffer. You owe them that.<eos> You want the peace of death.<eos> You're gonna have to earn it.<eos> Fight back!<eos> Do you think you deserve to be free of your pain?<eos> Do you deserve that gift?<eos> Because you're gonna get it.
Six names?<eos> How horrible.<eos> However, I will remind you that the young man Phillip Stroh advised was never charged with any crimes.<eos> Could we have more context?<eos> Perhaps running the names in that envelope could provide you with that.<eos> Or, given recent events, Mr. Stroh might be convinced to set aside privilege and identify this young man if you postpone his preliminary hearing, take the death penalty off the table, and allow him to serve his sentence in a federal prison of his own choosing.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> One moment.<eos> Listen, Rios, this offer gives you two for the price of one.<eos> Take it, and be grateful.
Do you have Chinese friends?<eos> I don't know them.<eos> Because I cannot... I have nothing to talk with them.<eos> They are professional people.<eos> Are any villagers working in the company?<eos> Yes, some...<eos> Four.<eos> One is a guard, three are cleaners.<eos> We have been using this land to grow food, but now all the land is taken by oil companies and we are suffering because even our water,<eos> we cannot drink it. It is dangerous.

It is dangerous.<eos> The water is dirty because they mix it with oil!<eos> They make holes deep in the ground, so all the water gets poisonous.<eos> If chickens drink it, they die.
Our people have been deceived!<eos> Even the military.<eos> They talk to you according to their level.<eos> Not everybody is a military.<eos> I blame our top people...<eos> Don't take their pictures!<eos> I was in my... first year senior. We had a song about our politicians.<eos> We called them the "poor politicians".<eos> What do you mean, a song?<eos> Yes, I had a song, but... a song has to be written down, then you can sing it perfectly.
But your land is... Very fertile and very big!<eos> That's why some people say, when God made Sudan, he laughed:<eos> "What a big land, without minds to develop it!"<eos> It has happened.<eos> We are not thinking.<eos> They say, "My land, my land..." To do what, alone?<eos> We must share the land with other people who have the technology to exploit it.<eos> There is no mechanization here, just... trees!<eos> Let us bring more awareness to our people, not to refuse on the land.<eos> When we say, "This land is given to investors", they should accept it.

I'll show you to your new seat.<eos> Right here.<eos> I'll be the attendant in first class.<eos> Is there anything I can get for you right now?<eos> - Something to drink?<eos> - No, I'm fine, thanks.<eos> No.<eos> No, I told Jerry to walk away.<eos> Yeah, well, sometimes you gotta leave the money on the table.<eos> You make 'em think you don't need it.
Well, uh, you know, I'm stretched a little thin.<eos> But if you wanted, you could go sit on the apartment.<eos> If you get anything juicy, you could slip it back to me here.<eos> Uh, yes. Merci.<eos> What is the address?<eos> I got a report of a stolen car in the area.<eos> The description matches this one.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> This car belongs to the security company I work for. I'm the supervisor.<eos> Here, check it out.
We all know that every inch of this building is under surveillance.<eos> We all know that this is Mr. Beckwith's private office.<eos> It would be illegal for us to surveil it or him without his knowledge, Agent Finley.<eos> I think we should let them see the tape.<eos> My chief of staff is being forced to help the kidnappers.<eos> It appears so, yes, sir.<eos> Then let's go see what those sons of bitches made Frank do.<eos> It's on this monitor here, sir.<eos> It shows Mr. Beckwith in his office between the first and second calls.<eos> You want to high-speed through it?
I know you want your son, but, Frank, you can stop this.<eos> Stop him.<eos> Look at the light, General.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> The proof of the massacre by those soldiers is on a helmet cam video.<eos> Where is that video?<eos> Vault 48... CIA, main building.<eos> Authenticate it.
We found an earbud in the general's ear.<eos> Kidnapper was talking to him the whole time.<eos> What does that tell you?<eos> The kidnapper was in the general's head when he killed himself.<eos> This was personal.<eos> It will be terrible for the general's family after all this is over to find out why he killed himself, the terrible things he did.<eos> They all looked up to him.<eos> It'll crush 'em to find out what kind of man he really was.<eos> You know, it's one thing hacking into the White House telecom, but that massacre video you need, it's locked inside a CIA vault.<eos> How you planning on getting it out?
It's true.<eos> We've had our differences.<eos> But I'm here as an ally.<eos> The decisions that you now must make implementing Project Exodus are unimaginably difficult.<eos> The Ark needs unity now more than ever.<eos> I hope that you can trust me enough to let me help you with that.<eos> I think we have a problem.<eos> Look. If she's just a hair off, she could lacerate the aorta when she extracts.<eos> Okay, Clarke, firm grip on the knife.<eos> You're gonna need to angle it upward and to the left, very slightly to the left as it exits the rib cage.
- Hold him still.<eos> Finn, I'm gonna get that knife out of you, okay?<eos> Good plan.<eos> Finn, you can't move.<eos> You got it?<eos> Okay.<eos> Here it goes.<eos> Nice and slow, Clarke.<eos> Finn, do not move.<eos> - Almost got it.
For the longest while, I've been trying to figure out what your hustle is.<eos> I don't have a hustle.<eos> You think it's my style to arrive by car crash and screw my way through town?<eos> You're sleeping with Roman.<eos> How's it any of your business?<eos> Let me tell you what I think's going down here.<eos> I don't believe there ever was a car crash.<eos> What are you, crazy?<eos> I know a grift when I see one.<eos> You find yourself a poor, little, rich boy, you park your car in front of his house and then you get your partner to ram it into the ditch.
OK, talk.<eos> Here?<eos> This is quite sensitive.<eos> I said talk.<eos> The Network lab in Tel Aviv.<eos> One of the men worked out the RNA codes for Janus.<eos> He has an idea of what it does.<eos> Has he told anyone?<eos> Half the lab, as many as 50 people.<eos> We're not sure exactly who yet, but we have it locked down.
'The bomb, in fact, had been placed in Mr Neave's blue Vauxhall car.<eos> 'Clearly, this was a deliberate and well-planned operation.<eos> 'But by whom?<eos> When Mrs Thatcher was given the news by an aide, 'nobody knew that the victim was one of her closest friends.'<eos> There's someone been killed in a bomb outside the House of Commons.<eos> Just now, seven minutes ago. Who?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> Terrible news, Mrs Thatcher.<eos> We've lost him.<eos> Don't you mean we've lost it?
Where's the money, you dumb shit?<eos> I'm working on it, sir.<eos> He's working on it, sir.<eos> Can he work harder?<eos> He says that Americans are practical.<eos> If you cannot do the job, then he is going to kill you.<eos> Mr. Bradock. I just wanted you to know we may not have the money in time for the deal.<eos> I had some money,<eos> He says that the only thing you are good at is jerking off, and he does not know how he ended up hiring you.<eos> Tell him I think I know who has it, and that we are pressing him.
Rose get back here now.<eos> I need your help.<eos> We're landing, whatever it is can wait.<eos> Now.<eos> Come now!<eos> All right, relax.<eos> Sir, we're landing.<eos> Would you power off your device?<eos> You call this a device?<eos> You have to turn it off.
All right, relax.<eos> Sir, we're landing.<eos> Would you power off your device?<eos> You call this a device?<eos> You have to turn it off.<eos> It's like when a cop calls a car a "vehicle".<eos> Or when he calls you sir when he means "asshole".<eos> Having a little gig in New York coming up.<eos> You give me three or four of those little baby vodkas<eos> I'll get you a front-row seat. Turn it off, put your seat up. We're landing, sir.
Give me this. Give... give me that.<eos> What is this?<eos> What are you, kidding me with this?<eos> You can't just wander around decapitating people willy-nilly.<eos> That's not what you do.<eos> Bad!<eos> Bad ghost child.<eos> Who taught you how to carry a sharp knife anyway, huh?<eos> You don't just carry it down like this.<eos> You carry it with the blade up.
Gina's desk!<eos> Oh, Jake. No!<eos> Captain, hey.<eos> You're looking stoic today, like a wise old oak.<eos> I'm not gonna give you more cases so you can win your bet with Santiago.<eos> What? Oh, right, the bet.<eos> Totally forgot about that.<eos> Well, granted, this friendly competition has led to you and Santiago putting in more hours and arresting more perps, especially this last week.<eos> Up by one, Peralta.<eos> Anything you want to say to your car before you never see it again?
I'm glad to see you two still work well together despite that ridiculous bet.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Me too.<eos> And I appreciate your turning down the relief team.<eos> I'm not sure they could've made that bust.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> The relief team.<eos> So... sorry you lost so much money last night.<eos> Guess you can add it to your list of bad dates.
Have a cold one.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay, why wouldn't I be okay?<eos> Talk to me, how soon till we're sprung?<eos> Yeah, about that...<eos> I don't hear any choppers, Carlos.<eos> I can't do it, Seth, you brought too much heat.<eos> No, no, what we did was make us all a hell of a lot of money, okay?<eos> Some of which can be yours.<eos> Now, you want it, you're gonna have to come and get it.
Now, I'm gonna try to free her.<eos> I'm recording what'll follow because, frankly I'm not sure either of us will survive it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's Jenny.<eos> So you found my file.<eos> We saw the video.<eos> How much of it did you see?<eos> Merely enough to identify you as Sheriff Corbin's subject.<eos> We did not wish to violate your privacy by not consulting you first.<eos> I've never seen it.
So you found my file.<eos> We saw the video.<eos> How much of it did you see?<eos> Merely enough to identify you as Sheriff Corbin's subject.<eos> We did not wish to violate your privacy by not consulting you first.<eos> I've never seen it.<eos> I don't remember any of it.<eos> Corbin always said it was better that way.<eos> Unfortunately, we don't have that choice.<eos> We need to watch it to see how Corbin took down the demon.
We think the same one that came for you is back.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - We cannot be certain. But surely it is connected to Moloch's greater plan.<eos> It wants something from us.<eos> Washington's Bible.<eos> - So give it the Bible.<eos> - We would... If I was not convinced that Washington embedded messages within it. Critical to the war against Moloch.<eos> He was a leader in the field of spy craft.<eos> So evil wants your playbook.<eos> In exchange, it won't harm Irving's daughter.
And why would we do that?<eos> I know you're up to something.<eos> You stay away from her.<eos> But if Castor is trying to stop integration from happening...<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen.<eos> I mean, after everything we've been through... black cyper, Trags, Red Hawk thugs...<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> You can come out now.<eos> Everybody knows.<eos> Apparently, an SEU guard took a video of the hologram and leaked it online.
- You're a fisherman?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Things are not easy, right now.<eos> Sylvie and I got into debt for a boat.<eos> We're in the shit!<eos> Duruy died of an overdose of pure heroin.<eos> Yes.<eos> And?<eos> You never get pure heroin on the market.<eos> If the killer injected him with it, he's a dealer in a league of his own, or he produces it.
We're all dying, Athelstan.<eos> Only these remain.<eos> Fragments.<eos> Undying fragments.<eos> Immortal words.<eos> I have some news.<eos> King Aelle and his family are to pay us a visit from Northumbria.<eos> Is that not where you come from?<eos> Yes, I was born there, and then sent to the monastery at Lindisfarne.<eos> Then you would call it home?
Oh, you just ask yourself,<eos> "What would Floki do?"<eos> And that will make you laugh and then you're already half cured.<eos> Don't joke with me.<eos> Who's joking?<eos> Rollo said that she is just a slave and I can have her any time.<eos> Now I'm okay.<eos> Your uncle is heavy-handed when he speaks to others about the heart.<eos> But, the truth is, he feels the pangs as deeply as you.<eos> But warriors don't show their heart, until the ax reveals it!
"Totally Awesome Ted."<eos> What, did you steal this off some other kid named Ted?<eos> I'm just getting warmed up here.<eos> This is fun.<eos> We're all...<eos> you know, it's...<eos> I'm having fun. When you squeeze this toy, a recording of Ted says,<eos> "I wuv you, Mommy!"<eos> Oh, but that's sweet! Why would we make fun of him for that?<eos> He gave it to her when he was 19.
I'm buying your life.<eos> Mr Yoon, we had a deal.<eos> Now, I understand your Mexican cartels have a reputation, but let me tell you something, so do the rednecks in Kentucky.<eos> Well, I'm willing to take that risk.<eos> But until that briefcase arrives, I won't be taking any.<eos> Now, if his money is good, I'm going with him.<eos> If he can't deliver, then I'll lake yours.<eos> How long is this liable to take?<eos> The money's in bitcoins.<eos> I was moving it around online, you know?

That is not an answer, dot-com.<eos> Six hours, maybe eight, before I can turn it into cash.
No, no, no.<eos> We're gonna hold on to that. This could be used as a weapon.<eos> I can't believe she gave me up.<eos> I did send y'all to her rescue. Said you disrespected her computer skills.<eos> What skills?<eos> How'd you lose your leg?<eos> Cancer when I was 14.<eos> How much time you think I'm looking at here?<eos> I don't sentence you.<eos> I just take you to jail. Man, I should have just run off with that money as soon as I had it.
When I get back...<eos> One or the other.<eos> Going to see your kid, huh?<eos> Going on your own dime this time?<eos> No, Chief. I won it on a radio contest.<eos> Plumber got caught with drugs on his way out.<eos> Shit. "Shit" is right.<eos> Keep it to yourself.<eos> Once word gets out, girls find out the heroin's dried up, might get ugly.<eos> What if I can keep it from drying up?
Nothing crazy people do surprises me.<eos> I write to Sherlock because he's the only person on the planet I can really talk to.<eos> He writes to me because I'm the only one he can talk to.<eos> The only one he can ever truly relate to.<eos> If you still don't understand that, you will someday.<eos> I promise.<eos> What's with the...?<eos> Telephone?<eos> I have felt compelled to hang up on a good few many people today.<eos> I dug it out of the closet so I could do it with more emphasis.
- Die!<eos> - Kill it!<eos> Kill it!<eos> Oh, it's the Mexican tapeworm from the diet.<eos> It's Medusa's cousin.<eos> Okay, get the picture, get the picture.<eos> - Oh! God!<eos> So gross.<eos> - I'm gonna get the picture.<eos> Did you get it?

A fan?<eos> Where-where'd you hear me play? Duke's?<eos> Lebemi's?<eos> The radio.<eos> No.<eos> I never got much radio play.<eos> It's been all over Filipino radio for years.<eos> My music's being played in the Philippines?<eos> Huh. Seems like Colin had no idea how popular he was over there.<eos> Whoever uploaded this video also geo-tagged it, giving away the exact location of where this interaction took place.
- No.<eos> - Oh, you did.<eos> You thought it!<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Hep C?<eos> - That would've been worth it.<eos> - Oh, come on, I don't believe you.<eos> Can I do something really corny right now?<eos> Again?<eos> I've been carrying this thing around for a week and I haven't used it once, but I'd really like a picture with you.
Did you touch Murphy yesterday?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess so.<eos> Why?<eos> The Grounders sent him here with a virus to infect us.<eos> Derek just died from it, another mark for your boyfriend's book.<eos> Get up. Clarke needs to examine you.<eos> Okay. We're done.<eos> No visible signs of swelling or bleeding.<eos> So you're saying she doesn't have it?
I'll have a family of my own. Listen, I was hoping you could get a message to Aiden.<eos> I am so sorry to do this, but Bianca just said my mother's on her way home,<eos> - and since it's me she'll blame...<eos> - Oh, thank you for taking the risk.<eos> Don't grow up too fast, buddy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, Jack. Carl dropped his puppy.<eos> Think he wants Emily to have it...
I mentioned keeping your distance, right?<eos> That's good.<eos> Much better.<eos> Change nothing.<eos> I'll go see to the others.<eos> Stay calm and compare, OK?<eos> That's good.<eos> It's much better.<eos> I'm disappointed not to wear the T-shirt...<eos> I'll look after it.
When we last saw each other<eos> I... Unless I misunderstood you?<eos> It prickles a bit.<eos> That's a traditional kiss which is untraditional.<eos> Hold on.<eos> What's that?<eos> What's that photo of me?<eos> How did it get here?<eos> Actually, it was in your file and I couldn't help myself.<eos> I felt something each time I looked at it.
17, 18 hours at a stretch.<eos> You think we have much of a choice here?<eos> This is the guy that took mom.<eos> Probably having her beaten every day or worse.<eos> Unclench yourself.<eos> Our job is to find Monroe and kill him, remember?<eos> This is not about you.<eos> It's about your mother.<eos> You trust the two of them?<eos> Still pulling the knife out of my back from the last time Tom put it there.
- Please.<eos> Duncan didn't know about the heist?<eos> Only 'cause it went to hell.<eos> Clean yourself off. Get dressed.<eos> You can't tell me you are actually thinking of helping.<eos> Look, I'm with you.<eos> This thing isn't God,<eos> Peter is nuts, but he is also right.<eos> There's barely a difference. Aaron!<eos> Forget what he's going to do, think about what it can do.

Aaron!<eos> Forget what he's going to do, think about what it can do.<eos> The nano is listening. It's watching us.<eos> Which is why we should let it die.
I am not afraid of it!<eos> No one is gonna threaten me.<eos> - I get to make my own choices.<eos> - Make your own choices?<eos> You haven't made your own choice in months.<eos> The minute this thing started, you followed its plan to the letter, like it or not.<eos> All we gotta do is nothing.<eos> We don't fix the code, and it just dies, on its own.<eos> I turned my back on this thing before.<eos> I pushed it away, and Cynthia died.
Look at you, all soft and fuzzy.<eos> Shut up. Mm-hmm.<eos> Our entire scripture is based on cleansing our souls so that we can be ready for our real life.<eos> There is no afterlife.<eos> There is a prelife, which is now.<eos> We don't begin until we reach home.<eos> And where is home?<eos> It's the ninth planet, just behind Neptune.<eos> And how do we get there?<eos> We have to earn it here on Earth by saving souls.
And you need that in U.S. dollars to leave the country<eos> I'll give you some, Uncle.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Don't need it.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Resolve gambling problems by gambling.<eos> In one game.<eos> Winner takes all that money.<eos> But it's mine to begin with.<eos> You lost it!
How about $1 million each to play?<eos> Too little for your lives $2 million then?<eos> If you don't have enough, bring a player.<eos> Winner gets all, loser goes to hell.<eos> Doesn't it sound fun?<eos> Pick the time and place.<eos> Did you all eat?<eos> Never thought you'd borrow money from me.<eos> Pay me back.<eos> Don't make me get it out of you.
Thank you, sir. I got it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wait a minute. This isn't my wal...<eos> Let's see.<eos> "Margaux Castevet."<eos> This is your lucky day.<eos> - Oui.<eos> Yes. - Great.<eos> I have this wallet, and it belongs to one of your tenants by the name of Margaux Castevet.<eos> Well, thank you. I will make sure it is returned to her.
No, I'm not.<eos> Can you please call her?<eos> - Margaux Castevet.<eos> - My ears are burning.<eos> Are you looking for me, darling? Yes.<eos> Yes. I have your wallet.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I just spent the last hour with the police.<eos> A complete waste of time.<eos> They had no hopes of returning it.
But nothing comes without a price.<eos> All right, I'm not having this conversation with a total stranger.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Professor.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Oh, um, a student.<eos> Well, I have news. They, uh, they read the book.<eos> They loved it.
Many strange images.<eos> Do you think it's a coincidence, or do you think his death has something to do with Nena?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But this is no purse snatcher, Rosemary.<eos> You need to let this go and let the police do their jobs.<eos> Be careful where you place your trust.<eos> I've never seen what you're doing to that chicken in any of my cooking classes.<eos> Because I'm brewing medicine.<eos> I see you're not wearing the amulet.<eos> I didn't feel like wearing it today.
No one is coming down to save us.<eos> [Whirring]<eos> [Breathing deeply]<eos> [Distant explosions]<eos> Hello?<eos> Is anyone there?<eos> Hello?<eos> Del:<eos> Let's get this party smoking.<eos> You don't want the fire too big. So maybe just try to knock it down with some wet leaves.
You're too stubborn to die.<eos> I could say the same for you.<eos> What is your situation?<eos> We have about a dozen survivors.<eos> That's good work, Councilor.<eos> Sinclair is rerouting power and air to the mess hall.<eos> Lead your people there.<eos> After we get you.<eos> No. A fire burned through most of our oxygen.<eos> We put it out, but we don't have very long.
I found some good antenna wire for the radios.<eos> This guy was using it to fix his bed.<eos> You find anything else from the Exodus ship wreckage?<eos> Yeah, data log.<eos> Want to hear something weird?<eos> [Static]<eos> [Quivering signal] Sounds like interference. Wait.<eos> It get weirder.<eos> When the signal hit, their nav. system went nuts.<eos> They never got it back, and then... boom.
About GPS, his favorite!<eos> GPS - - Is that your answer? You know what I'm thinking?<eos> If GPS has a calf and it's a male, I'll give it to Issan.<eos> Issan deserves your whole herd.<eos> - All the cows?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He deserves them. He's a good boy.<eos> He'll still be pleased to have GPS's calf.<eos> Won't he?<eos> He'll get it.
Why are you always criticizing me?<eos> ! Is this really how you want to start the day? !<eos> My day started 5 hours ago.<eos> I am under a lot of pressure!<eos> How?<eos> ! How? !<eos> You take three classes a week, and you miss half of them! The parking is tricky!<eos> Morning, sunshine.<eos> I saved you some lunch.<eos> I get it, okay? ! I'm lazy!
! Oh, my God!<eos> That's amazing!<eos> - We just got engaged a few months ago.<eos> - Oh! - Great. - Yeah, so we will definitely give you your privacy.<eos> - Congratulations. - Absolutely.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> You know what?<eos> If you wanted, I could pretend like I'm texting, and I could video the whole thing on my phone.<eos> That way, you'd have it forever. - Really?
- Yeah.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> You know what?<eos> If you wanted, I could pretend like I'm texting, and I could video the whole thing on my phone.<eos> That way, you'd have it forever. - Really?<eos> I mean, that--<eos> - Yeah. - That would be awesome.<eos> - A-are you sure?<eos> He gets very, uh, well, excited.<eos> And he might give it away.
You want everybody to know about your father, is that it?<eos> You spoiled little brat.<eos> Daddy can't protect you anymore from all of this because he's dead.<eos> So, unless you want to join his sorry ass...<eos> Too tight? Maybe next time you'll think twice before trying to steal meds.<eos> Too bad.<eos> Sign right here.<eos> And I'll need the evidence for booking.<eos> Blood, too?<eos> If he tried to steal it.
You should've told me. You needed to rest.<eos> And I thought I could handle it myself.<eos> By beasting out on them?<eos> They would've shot me.<eos> And I'm not sure what they saw, but if they knew about my father, they already know about beasts anyway.<eos> So there are still people after us. No, you mean me.<eos> Why?<eos> To get an antique store?<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> To the store, to try and figure out what they're after so I can get it before they do.
You think you owe him.<eos> I do owe him.<eos> Well, in that case, you know, I think you should take some responsibility for all the good he's done since.<eos> You know, the bad guys he's stopped, the beasts, the people he's saved, including Cat.<eos> You can't beat yourself up without patting yourself on the back, too.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Where's Catherine and Tori?<eos> There doesn't seem to be much here except dust.<eos> Doesn't seem like the place has been open in a while.<eos> Then why'd they want it so badly?
Or he hacked it.<eos> That, too.<eos> Okay, so, who runs the Manhattan office?<eos> Anderson Cross.<eos> All right, let's see if Mr. Cross knows what Ted was up to. I don't know, Castle.<eos> Maybe your mom's right.<eos> I think elopement's a great idea.<eos> There's no planning, no lists.<eos> All we do is we just get married.<eos> Beckett, I promise you, there is a perfect date for our perfect wedding, and we will find it.
Fine.<eos> We'll call it $1 million and $80!<eos> Well, there is a small problem there.<eos> We agreed on 50 grand a kilo!<eos> And 50 times 20...<eos> I think we're probably a little closer to 19 and a half.<eos> Okay, a couple Q's, I'd love some A's.<eos> One, what the hell is that thing?<eos> Uh, we made a body cast out of the coke.<eos> But I tested it, it's very pure.
Oh, great, yes, and we've got about a five-hour flight home with Pam...<eos> Cocaine.<eos> So can you throw in a pound of coke?<eos> Can I? I totally insist!<eos> Oh. So, you're being facetious.<eos> Extremely, yes.<eos> A, the coke is gone.<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean, gone?<eos> Oh, it's not gone, gone, just you-know-who has it.
Get cocaine!<eos> Oh, Sterling, I'm so cold.<eos> What, like hearted?<eos> Ramón, what the hell, was this all a scam, or...<eos> No, no, I swear, it's just muy complicado.<eos> I am sorry, I cannot explain right now.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Why, because you're...<eos> Dying, right, sorry.<eos> Take the money. God knows you've earned it.
- What?<eos> - Not to snort, you idiot!<eos> - Well, I don't want to shoot it.<eos> - That seems like a pretty slippery slope!<eos> - Pam, any cocaine is a slippery slope!<eos> It's the world's most addictive drug.<eos> - Hang on, I heard it was nicotine.<eos> - It may very well be, Pam, but in our current situation I would argue that cocaine is more dangerous, because we're about to get murdered for it!<eos> - Yeah, but not overall...<eos> - They don't want us, - they just want the coke, so throw it out!
Are you insane? Yeah, if it's insane to use an X-gen asymmetric onion router and digital cryptocurrency to sell your cocaine anonymously and completely risk-free.<eos> Or a lot of the other shit I do.<eos> But... So do people e-mail you, or...<eos> No. It's like shopping online, only for cocaine.<eos> I've already sold, wow, almost 800 grand worth.<eos> Really?<eos> But how do we get paid? With a totally untraceable digital currency that we can exchange for real US dollars whenever we want.<eos> I call 'em Kriegerrands.<eos> And then how do they get the cocaine?<eos> We pack it up and ship it. Easy-peasy.
- Odie, hush.<eos> So why do you guys have my cocaine? - We...<eos> - I'm not done.<eos> - What have you done with Gomez...<eos> What, you're just not gonna answer?<eos> Oh!<eos> S-Sorry.<eos> You kind of trailed off like - there was, like, a third...<eos> - Why do you have my cocaine and where the hell is Gomez, full goddamn stop!<eos> Gomez was gonna steal it.
What's it look like I'm doing?<eos> But before you answer, please don't say "literally being emasculated," because I looked that up and...<eos> Ick. Hold it up. Lana, come on.<eos> You and Mother smashed my balls pretty good.<eos> Kudos, they're swollen.<eos> But I don't need a cutman.<eos> The painting, you idiot. Oh.<eos> Thought you meant my genitals.<eos> But look, I know you're jealous I had sex with Juliana, almost twice. But don't slash the painting, it's... Priceless.<eos> But worthless if you damage it.
Okay... Mark!<eos> Twain!<eos> No, that's barges!<eos> Shut up, but, hey, speaking of time...<eos> What's your Bishop score? How should I...<eos> Wait, how do you even know what a Bishop score is?<eos> I got certified as a doula. Which, turns out, is not that hard.<eos> Shut up, does the CIA know Calderon has a nerve gas missile at the palace?<eos> We didn't give him gas! Cool!<eos> Well he's got it, and we can't override the launch sequence, so...
They knew we would follow down Khalid Ansari to Borz Altan and the C.B.O.T., and they knew we would take Mykola here.<eos> They're a step ahead of us.<eos> They played us.<eos> I want to stay on this, Calder.<eos> I know you do, and we need you.<eos> You said you wanted a mission, well, now you've got one.<eos> I'll give it everything I got.<eos> Arthur, what's going on?<eos> Well, I thought about your offer.<eos> I'm gonna take you up on it. Outstanding.
Where's Councilor Sydney?<eos> She left before the blast.<eos> You do that, and double the guard at the dropship. I'm putting The Ark on lockdown! Aah!<eos> We are not missing that launch window.<eos> They suspect it was you.<eos> The way I see it, we got two choices... stay and fight, in which case maybe we win if we can get enough workers to join us.<eos> And if we don't, what's the second choice?<eos> Take the Exodus ship now.<eos> It's not ready.<eos> Can our engineers get it ready?
Jeanette, of course.<eos> By the way, have you talked to Jeanette lately? - I haven't talked to her.<eos> - Liar.<eos> So I was at your apartment stealing your mail, and apparently there's some chick named Victoria sending you jewelry from Germany?<eos> Somebody owes somebody an explanation.<eos> Jeanette, that locket is a wedding gift for Robin.<eos> Robin? !<eos> Oh, God, this again?<eos> That I'm giving to her as a friend because I'm kind of the wedding gift master!<eos> Now bring it back to me right now! Fine.
Yeah.<eos> Lily used the word "ragamuffin."<eos> So I've told you all my stories. I'm afraid so, I have plenty of stories that you don't know yet.<eos> Like the one where my college roommates and I went to this male strip club...<eos> And your friend Dongnose got smacked on the nose with a dong?<eos> I know that one.<eos> Okay.<eos> What about the story that explains how... Dongnose got her nickname "Dongnose"<eos> and that it had nothing to do with the dong-smacking incident?<eos> Heard it, loved it, called it the greatest coincidence of the 21st century.
I'm just being cautious.<eos> I'll take a test when I get home. It can wait.<eos> Are Marvin and I and any other future children we may have just some consolation prize?<eos> I have to get out of here.<eos> It can't wait.<eos> - Lily, what a lovely...<eos> - Can I use your powder room?<eos> Two minutes. Here we go.<eos> Guys, we need to go back to the hotel.<eos> Lily peed on that, and you touched it.
Last year, when you helped Victoria escape this church, how hard was it to climb down that drainpipe?<eos> Extremely hard.<eos> Okay, so that means super easy.<eos> Thanks. Wait, wait. Stop, stop.<eos> What the hell are you doing? I just... I can't go through with this!<eos> No, no. Sorry. I refuse to be a part of a third runaway bride situation.<eos> It's like the dude in that documentary who kept having women show up dead at the bottom of his staircase.<eos> Sure, maybe they all tripped, but it's like, do you want to hang out with that guy?<eos> Gonna think I'm insane, but... I still think that it's a bad sign I never found that locket.<eos> Some part of me thought that Barney would magically find it.
Nervous?<eos> Why is she nervous?<eos> I'm not nervous!<eos> Who's nervous? !<eos> No one needs to be nervous!<eos> Cornflower blue, Ted. Cornflower blue!<eos> First off, kudos to Marshall and Lily for calming you down.<eos> Second, do you... you remember Robin's locket?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> She never found it.

How'd you find it?
VowerPoint... - I know it's a lot, but I-I don't want to screw up this wedding thing.<eos> "I vow to love you forever unconditionally,<eos> "unless you pudge out, in which case I'm a Barney-shaped hole in the wall."<eos> "I vow to start watching hockey with you.."<eos> Oh, that one's sweet.<eos> I know how much you hate hockey. "...once a month""<eos> But it's still a nice gesture. "No.<eos> Once a year.<eos> No. Hockey's dumb.<eos> "Not watching it, and neither are you, woman.
No way!<eos> See?<eos> Barney came through.<eos> There's your sign.<eos> You're good to go.<eos> Where'd you find the locket, Ted?<eos> Where did you find the locket?<eos> Me?<eos> Why-why are you asking me?<eos> Barney found it.

What, you lost a locket?<eos> Barney wouldn't tell me how he found it, which made me realize it had to be you.

Yeah.<eos> That's Ted's.<eos> So, Marshall, how's your job going? Mm.<eos> My chair... is reasonably comfortable.<eos> For short periods of time.<eos> Marshall has decided to say only positive things about being back in corporate law.<eos> So you hate it?<eos> Much of what I do does not make me cry.<eos> But the job's only temporary.<eos> Marshall was offered the judgeship once, and he turned it down for me.
How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up?<eos> Look, I know that odds are the love of my life isn't gonna magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at... 2:43 in the morning, but... this seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know... sit and wait.<eos> Um... uh, c-can you tell Lily I-I had to go?<eos> I got to split.<eos> Speaking of splits, do you think I can do a split in midair like my boy David Lee Roth?<eos> I know you can't.<eos> Challenge accepted.<eos> Oh, my scrotum!<eos> I can't get out of this thing.<eos> I'm holding it.
Don't do that to yourself.<eos> - There are people here to help. - Who I'm driving away.<eos> I lashed out at you.<eos> I jeopardized Aiden's life.<eos> I'm starting to go after the wrong people, Nolan.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> Okay.<eos> Great, thanks.<eos> I just need the loan approved, and then I can make the offer on the house. What?<eos> The guy says I should have it in a couple days.
Handsome Bobby Pardillo, and in exchange, we will not divulge your assistance.<eos> Or... don't tell us what you know, and you can add two new enemies to a long and growing list.<eos> You threatening me?<eos> We think it's only a matter of time before police prove that Scalice was working under your orders when he killed Bobby Pardillo.<eos> Give us the name of the officer we believe you have on your payroll, and we will talk to our captain, see if a deal can't be struck.<eos> We don't have a cop.<eos> Dante didn't have a cop.<eos> And if one of you has sent him that packet, it's news to me, and it's your problem.<eos> Packet?<eos> Dante got it in the mail ten days ago, out of nowhere.
Um, what?<eos> Doesn't seem like... are, are you a virgin?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Um, no.<eos> You were a virgin when we were seeing each other?<eos> Yeah, I was 12.<eos> You said he was a virgin.<eos> I think we drink virgin blood because it sounds cool.<eos> I think of it like this...<eos> If you're going to eat a sandwich.. You will just enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it.
Let me feel!<eos> Let me feel!<eos> Ow. Ah, where?<eos> Where?<eos> Guess it stopped.<eos> Wait.<eos> Nope, just gas.<eos> I gotta call Luke.<eos> Don't feel bad.<eos> You'll have plenty of time to spend with that baby after Violet dumps it on you.
If I could figure out where the hole was, I'd probably jab a tampon in it.<eos> Nice.<eos> That way, the house can do archery and ride a horse.<eos> I guess I'll just climb up there and throw a big tarp over everything.<eos> Really?<eos> With one foot?<eos> Who else is gonna do it, Mom?<eos> Are you gonna do it?<eos> You don't even know to microwave a sponge.<eos> Why don't you just call Baxter and see if he can fix it?
Keep it moving!<eos> I always wondered how they made sponges.<eos> Somebody need a hole plugged?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> There's a... old tarp in the shed.<eos> Just cover as much of the roof as you can, and I'll get a roofer out here next week.<eos> A roofer? [laughs]<eos> La-di-dah!<eos> When did you get so middle-class?<eos> Can you find the leak, cover it with hot tar, and then reshingle?
- I need to talk to you.<eos> Okay, well, let's talk.<eos> I think we're good?<eos> Yeah, I just need to fix up my makeup.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> - But you got--you know-- yeah, okay.<eos> All right, and you?<eos> [Giggles] Come back.<eos> I'm about to do my audition.<eos> Can--can you be in the room when I do it?
I can honestly say this is the first day I've felt 100%.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> - Hey. - Hey.<eos> I was hoping I could talk to you for a second?<eos> I need some advice.<eos> What did Otis do?<eos> - It's not that.<eos> What's going on?<eos> So my boss is opening a new restaurant in New York.<eos> And he wanted me to go help set it up.
Can I help you?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> We don't know where to go.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> We'll get you set up.<eos> My husband has emphysema.<eos> - I told you, I'm fine. - Hush, Sam.<eos> I don't know what she'd do if she didn't have me to worry about.<eos> Well, now she has us to do it for her, huh?<eos> Hey, the damn pilot went out, and, every time I relight it, the whole system shuts off.
Try to keep up.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Walden Schmidt.<eos> Holy Schmidt!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Mr. Schmidt, it is such an honor to meet you.<eos> I have a poster of you.<eos> A poster?<eos> Yeah, yeah, check it out.<eos> I made it in college.
He's got a tick on his 'nads.<eos> Huh. I never thought anything could live off Zippy.<eos> I don't see how this is gonna make us more productive, but I really don't care.<eos> And that is the beauty of pot.<eos> You got work to do, you don't care.<eos> You got bills to pay, you don't care.<eos> You see a picture of your roommate's gonads... you care.<eos> But the image is fading.<eos> Yeah, marijuana is excellent.<eos> I don't know why I waited this long to try it.
She waxes people.<eos> Maybe she's seen something like this before.<eos> All right, l-let's see.<eos> Oh...<eos> Check it out, dude.<eos> Where's your other hand in that picture?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Three people can't fit on an eagle.<eos> You-you changed my code.<eos> Yeah. I made it better.
And I can't live with that.<eos> And the only way I'm not gonna reopen this case is if he passes that test.<eos> Okay.<eos> You'll be in room nine.<eos> Let me know if you need anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Bates Motel.<eos> - Oh, it's me, Emma.<eos> Would you mind bringing up my book?<eos> I think I left it on the desk in the office.

Count to ten. It's all right.<eos> He's going to wake up.<eos> I'm afraid not, Jeremy. I'm sorry.<eos> May I join you?<eos> I'm very impressed with your knowledge of my favourite book.<eos> Dare I say it, you know it better than me.<eos> John 1:1.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Let me see if I can get it without looking it up.
Bunty's right.<eos> -We are forgetting Audrey.<eos> -I've forgotten nothing.<eos> She writing a family history.<eos> Codswallop, more like!<eos> You're welcome to it.<eos> Thank you, but I find the present more relevant than the past at this stage.<eos> I can't understand why you're interested in Audrey's dreary book.<eos> I wonder, as you were so close to her heart, whether it would be apt to include an extract in her eulogy.<eos> You might rethink when you've read it.
Lysette soon discovered she had a religious notoriety - the sick and the dying demanded to be cured.<eos> So she sought sanctuary in Briars Priory after she has taken holy orders.<eos> Her final days are lost in mystery.<eos> No-one even knows where she's buried.<eos> After she died, the relic disappeared.<eos> The priory was looted during the dissolution of the monasteries.<eos> No trace of the rosary was ever found. And it's been missing ever since.<eos> I may be a step closer to finding it.<eos> Lysette Penhallick's prayer book.<eos> I discovered it languishing in the Ashmolean archives.

No, wait.<eos> Listen!<eos> It's the snowplow.<eos> Now, people will be able to get to us.<eos> I told you, it is gonna be one of those magical New York City nights.<eos> Do it again!<eos> Season 3, Episode 13 "And the Big But"<eos> Why are we here?<eos> It's still snowing, and we have no customers.<eos> I had to put money in the cash register just to steal it.
Are you thinking of readmitting her?<eos> She's so very withdrawn.<eos> Sir Aaron, can I be of any help?<eos> Well, I think some spiritual guidance may help.<eos> I don't think she'd come to me.<eos> Why don't you join Mrs. McCarthy at the house this evening.<eos> I'll see you this evening.<eos> Magnus, would you fetch Miss Alice's things from the hospital, please?<eos> And... and her shotgun from the police station.<eos> They no longer need it.
Rocking horse?<eos> Oh, yeah, went and collected it off some kid.<eos> Only decent thing in the house.<eos> Mum had fallen behind with her loan.<eos> So you took her child's toy?<eos> You absolve sins, I collect debts!<eos> That's what I do, mate!<eos> Sorry about your bike.<eos> Don't you want your crucifix?<eos> You can keep it.
Oh.<eos> Hi.<eos> - I'm Christy.<eos> - All right.<eos> Oh, look, we're the same height.<eos> [laughing] Okay. Just came by to insult me, did you?<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> I just wanted to tell you that...<eos> My car.<eos> I was thinking about getting it painted.
No need to get rough!<eos> Shit, take the money and go.<eos> The money?<eos> Oh, no, you got us all wrong.<eos> We looking for someone name of Boyd Crowder.<eos> The word is that this his place.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, man, take that shit out his mouth so he can talk, man. 'Scoe!<eos> Take it out.
Miller, would you call this a herd, a gaggle, or a flock of assholes?<eos> I would call this a United Nations of assholes.<eos> Well, that's funny, 'cause we were just discussing ratifying some shit.<eos> Boys, we're gonna need you two to put them guns down. Uh, Raylan, can I be excused from the table?<eos> No, you may not.<eos> Boys.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I'm sorry? "King Lear"?<eos> Shakespeare?<eos> Basically, Lear split his kingdom in half and gave it to his two daughters, deal being Lear get to hang out and keep 100 knights.
what?<eos> - You know I don't go for that shit.<eos> - Then what the hell is going on with you?<eos> You were supposed to crack the vault, but you had to step away. Why?<eos> You used to be razor sharp.<eos> That's why you were so good with a blade.<eos> You know, it's funny that you should mention that.<eos> Where the hell is my knife?<eos> - I got rid of it.<eos> - You did what? I want it back.
- Okay. Before we go any further, we're gonna have to set up some ground rules, okay, Sheriff?<eos> - I'm not a sheriff.<eos> - Yeah, and I don't spend my days looking at pictures of people with bones through their noses.<eos> These "crazy little Gods"... Are my life's work.<eos> If I said something insensitive, I apologize.<eos> What I meant to say was,<eos> I'm trailing two murderous thieves that killed eight men... Including my mentor.<eos> So, what makes you so certain they're connected to the cartel?<eos> A symbol that shows up at every murder.<eos> I found it again today.
She's always looking for the family toolbox... - How you doing? - Trying to find ways to fix her old man.<eos> I'll catch up.<eos> Well.<eos> Aren't you a little young to be hanging out in here?<eos> You're a little pistol, aren't you?<eos> Now, I mapped out where all the killings happened along the border.<eos> Maybe they'll show us...<eos> Where's the knife?<eos> - What?<eos> - Did you take it? - What?

An immunity hearing.<eos> I'm going to present your case in front of a judge who can dismiss the charges outright.<eos> Preston.<eos> Chief wants an update on the Gavin Hope case.<eos> I looked into our victim a little more.<eos> Couple of things jumped out at me about Walt Yeager.<eos> Like what?<eos> Single guy, holds down a six-figure-a-year job.<eos> He owns a home south of broad.<eos> So why would a man like that break into a home to presumably rob it?
Richie wins, you give me the keys and let us go.<eos> And if he loses?<eos> Well, then, I guess I'm stuck here, literally.<eos> No way. I'm not doing this.<eos> Well, you don't really have a choice.<eos> It's her eyeball.<eos> You need to try this one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> - He just gave it to me.

Where did you get it the first time?<eos> I told you. I won it in a contest.
Assuming that's all they want to do is bite.<eos> I got a knife.<eos> Where the hell's my knife?<eos> Tanner took it.<eos> Why the hell would he take your knife?<eos> These people believe that with enough sacrifice... The Vision Serpent would grant them ascension to the next realm.<eos> And it all happens right here.<eos> He's obsessed.<eos> Where's the knife?<eos> Did you take it?
Who wouldn't?<eos> I did.<eos> I've had a little trouble securing the money.<eos> What?<eos> That's unacceptable.<eos> I completely agree.<eos> So you don't know where it is?<eos> Why would I?<eos> My job was to take care of Richard. And you were supposed to take care of the money.<eos> Well, I cannot find it.
My old man was a son of a bitch and a world-class prick, but he didn't deserve to die.<eos> I need your brother, Seth. I can't bring down the nine lords without him.<eos> I don't care about your stupid crusade.<eos> Oh, but you will.<eos> Trust me. The nine houses may live in the shadows, Seth, but they have great power in this realm.<eos> They have more wealth than you can even imagine.<eos> I already got what I need.<eos> It's never enough.<eos> You don't love the money.<eos> You love stealing it.
Get that gun out of my face.<eos> Says the guy who put a knife to my neck.<eos> You know, all this time I thought I was the one that brought us here, that I did the deal with Carlos.<eos> Turns out, you've been a part of this club before I even knew it existed.<eos> Are you kidding me right now?<eos> After everything I've done for you?<eos> Sonny doesn't betray Michael, Seth. - That was Fredo.<eos> - Then explain the knife.<eos> It's a blade, it cuts.<eos> I ditched it at a liquor store hundreds of miles from here, and it still found its way back to you.

Maybe it's not a good idea.<eos> Come on, just grow a pair.<eos> Or strap on a pair from my drawer and talk to her.<eos> Or you could go to a movie with me.<eos> I'm gonna go see Nicole.<eos> Hey, Berta, want to go to the movies?<eos> Sounds good. See you later.<eos> ♪ Men. ♪ Can I get my free refill, please?<eos> Sorry, sir. That offer only applies on the day of purchase.<eos> I know. I, uh, I purchased it today. So...
The file you were supposed to send me.<eos> I need it.<eos> Oh... uh, yeah, right.<eos> The file.<eos> Is... this... what... you... want...?<eos> Nicole. Is this what you wanted?<eos> Huh? The file.<eos> It's right here. Oh.<eos> Right. Yeah.<eos> Let me just... put it in.
So, look at this wall.<eos> All of it is gray except for this big black stone.<eos> It stood out to me, so I tracked down Gay.<eos> She's a geology fellow at NYU.<eos> I asked her to take a look.<eos> It's interesting.<eos> Tough to tell from the photo.<eos> But I think I see some striations on this rock, and that would mean that...<eos> It's dug up from well beneath the surface of the earth.<eos> Yeah, well, can't say for sure without seeing it in person, so we're gonna go to Riverdale, see if it's still there.

I'm, Jerry Thomas.<eos> I'm the curator of the fossil collection here.<eos> Sherlock Holmes. This is my associate Joan Watson.<eos> Well, my assistant tells me you're with the NYPD, and you think you found a fossil.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is this real?<eos> We believe it is.

It's an infant.
But I always thought that whoever killed him took the rock, too.<eos> You didn't know it was in his backyard?<eos> I gave it to him in his garage.<eos> I mean, the guy must've stashed the thing in there himself.<eos> I didn't kill Doug.<eos> I didn't kill Doug...<eos> I mean, you can take my DNA. You can hook me up to a lie detector.<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> Volunteered his DNA rather cheerfully, didn't he?<eos> Whoever murdered Newberg wanted that skeleton, but they never found it.

Even so... I'd rather die with a view of the Mediterranean.<eos> Not that we get to pick and choose.<eos> Was supposed to be an easy posting, America.<eos> Nothing's easy.<eos> Very true.<eos> My mother, she... She survived the pogroms.<eos> Her tough-guy son from the kibbutz can't even survive Washington.<eos> - You're not dead yet.<eos> - Ah, I've got a fever.<eos> I can feel it.
I think so.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you feel better?<eos> It's not gonna work.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because you bought it out of the back of a comic book.<eos> - If I can just attach these two pieces... - Attach what?<eos> My star wheel.<eos> Let me see.<eos> See, what you're supposed to do is rotate the wheel to the time you want, and then match it with the real stars.
Yes. Go away.<eos> -Hey... -Get your stuff and go away, brother.<eos> -But for what...?<eos> -Want to be hit?<eos> Grab that shit and go away!<eos> Come on, disappear.<eos> Maybe we can sell this thing.<eos> That bastard lives in the social housing.<eos> He sells stolen phones.<eos> If you don't want to call the police, give me 5,000, I'll go there and buy it back for you.
My rangers are hungry.<eos> They're at the river.<eos> Go feed them!<eos> We march on the invaders' camp at first light.<eos> I'll make quick work of what you failed to do.<eos> Starting with this one.<eos> - Over there.<eos> - A signal fire!<eos> Reapers.<eos> - Let them know we see it.
Plus, I, uh, dropped some olives under the bed, can't reach 'em.<eos> Oh. I got little pinchers.<eos> I was gonna watch the, uh, Pistons of Detroit game.<eos> Don't really have the reach for that.<eos> Good thing I got legs. - Wait.<eos> You like the Pistons? - Oh, yeah. Just like you.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah, I'm dead serious.<eos> - Aw! - So, you in?<eos> - Be cool to watch it on a big TV.
I'm gonna have to turn off the tap.<eos> - What tap?<eos> - The sex tap.<eos> But I need my vitamin D.<eos> As long as you're wearing that shirt, the tap is off.<eos> - No more... hot water.<eos> - All right, fine, then.<eos> My shirt and I will go sleep in my bed.<eos> What happened to your Pistons jersey?<eos> Did you rip it off and rush in here 'cause she got to have it?

It's the only thing you can trust.<eos> You care to elaborate, you know, on this whole analog thing?<eos> No, here's the reality, you never know what's gonna happen with a phone.<eos> Right.<eos> The hinges that hold the flip together, they get loosened over time when-when they get wet.<eos> And then once you open it, it's easier for people to go in there and see your passwords and, you know, see your codes.
Exactly!<eos> Tell that to her and you get a friend for life.<eos> Now, excuse me.<eos> Sex awaits.<eos> Hey, Jess! You win!<eos> I want to take you!<eos> Respectfully!<eos> - Come here.<eos> - Take that Jersey off.<eos> Actually, leave it on.
Take a picture of me.<eos> And use the flash.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It started showing up a couple of months ago.<eos> It only happens with the flash on.<eos> And I don't know how, but Barrow knew about it.<eos> He used my own phone to take pictures of me.<eos> That's why you asked for it back.
God, come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Stiles?<eos> - Scott, I don't think I can get out of here. - I can't move.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know, It's too dark.<eos> I can't see much and something's wrong with my leg.<eos> It's stuck on something. And it's...<eos> - I think it's bleeding.
I kind of overheard...<eos> Well, I listened in on Stiles talking to Scott.<eos> How he thinks he was the one who wrote that message in the Chemistry room.<eos> The message telling Barrow to kill Kira.<eos> You think Stiles, skinny, defenseless, Stiles is the Nogitsune?<eos> A powerful, dark spirit?<eos> I'm not the only one thinking it.<eos> I'm just the only one saying it.<eos> This thing wants to possess someone and chooses Stiles?<eos> Why wouldn't it take someone bigger, stronger?
You will be wearing these, Stiles.<eos> No laces allowed.<eos> You don't have a belt, do you?<eos> And please empty your pockets in here.<eos> Your pillow.<eos> We forgot your pillow.<eos> - Dad, it's okay. - No, no.<eos> You're never going to be able to fall asleep.<eos> We got to go back. It's fine, Dad.<eos> I don't need it.

It's fine, Dad.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> I can't believe I forgot it.<eos> I mean, every time that we've ever stayed in a hotel, the first thing you pack is your pillow.<eos> You can bring it tomorrow.
Well, if we're not going to kill him, why aren't we at least tying him down with really big chains?<eos> I might have something more effective.<eos> Get him off me!<eos> Get him off me!<eos> Kanima venom.<eos> Nice touch.<eos> You know how they say that twins get a feeling when the other one's in pain?<eos> You didn't lose that talent, too, did you?<eos> Oh, I hope not.<eos> You're going to need it.
It was an internment camp during World War II.<eos> In Oak Creek.<eos> Not too far from here.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You told Allison and Isaac that there was no internment camp at Oak Creek.<eos> Allison's family has a certain history of violence.<eos> I didn't know if she could be trusted.<eos> There was a camp, yes.<eos> But all the records were erased.<eos> They covered it up.
I had to find him.<eos> I had to stop him.<eos> Kira, hurry. Night is coming.<eos> Coup de foudre.<eos> The literal translation is "a bolt of lightning."<eos> In French, it can also mean "love at first sight."<eos> But a bolt of lightning happens to be exactly what we need right now.<eos> For what?<eos> Excising the nogitsune from Rhys' body shattered the katana.<eos> But you can put it back together.
You're pale, thin and you look like you're getting worse.<eos> And we're all sitting here thinking it.<eos> When we find the other you, is he gonna look like he's getting better?<eos> What happens if he gets hurt?<eos> You mean if he dies, do I die?<eos> I don't care.<eos> Just so long as no else dies because of me.<eos> I remember everything I did, Scott.<eos> I remember pushing that sword into you.<eos> I remember twisting it.
I recall it a little differently.<eos> It took five days to rebuild the ones that broke - when you swept them to the floor.<eos> - You swept them to the floor.<eos> Hey, romantic urgency.<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> Donna, I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> Okay, now leave me alone. I gotta work. Okay.<eos> Okay, oh, do you want tickle spray?<eos> Sure.<eos> Some guy who doesn't work here anymore left it in his desk, so I stole it.

What-- what's going on?<eos> Someone-- someone in there with you?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> It's, um-- it's Giselle.<eos> Giselle's back. Awesome! Hey.<eos> Look, Mark. We're, uh, kind of in the middle of something, you know?<eos> No. I don't know. Let me in.<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> We didn't want you to find out this way, but, you know, there's always been that unspoken thing between Giselle and I?<eos> Well, we've been exploring it.
- Hell, no. But it should be the same as shooting a camera, right?<eos> Shake, even in death, you can't hold a gun steady, Shake.<eos> I'm getting pretty fed up with this Shaky Hands bullshit, mothaf...<eos> Holy... F... Mackerel.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We've been trying to take down the Swedish Mafia for months.<eos> We couldn't have done it without your help.<eos> Good. Thanks.<eos> That's great. Can I get that tape, please?<eos> I gotta take it back to the bootleggers so I can get back to my job.
- Oh, you mean with the gun?<eos> Yes. Oh, no, that was an accident.<eos> - You know it, me knew Shaky still have a shaky trigger finger, man.<eos> Come on, knock it off.<eos> Do you realize the reason he's sticking around is because he's tired of being called Shaky Hands?<eos> No, boy, me not make fun of him, man.<eos> Me not just give anyone some nickname.<eos> If me give you a nickname, that's because me have respect for you.<eos> Shaky, if you hearing this, man, we want you to know me miss ya.<eos> Even though you had the shakey hand, me know you always loan me money when we need it.
- Are you sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just ran into my long-lost cousin who I'd never met, and the fact that we have the same grandfather, the very man who rented that apartment, I... I don't know.<eos> It seems like it's a sign.<eos> Like it's all part of some bigger plan.<eos> - I'll start the paperwork.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Oh, one thing that's definitely, you know, not part of the bigger plan.<eos> That broken window, can you fix that?<eos> I'll take a look at it.
- It's important.<eos> - Kevin: No. I have never seen a ghost.<eos> I don't even know how that would work... that could... that could be anybody on there.<eos> Camomile: I really want to believe in you, Mr. Paclogaloogie.<eos> Oh, uh, close.<eos> Mr. Pacalioglu.<eos> Uh, I mean, at least I think it is.<eos> I never met my parents.<eos> Your business is finished.<eos> (Camomile speaking indistinctly) Camomile: I think maybe I can supply you with some footage if you need it.
Blob, is that you?<eos> Cause I'm pretty sure I banished you, buddy.<eos> Okay, that better be somebody living, like a robber or a murderer, because I am so done with...<eos> Sue...<eos> You can see me.<eos> Oh, my God, Sue, you're... you're dead, what happened?<eos> You were right, the subway... there's something else down there.<eos> - Yeah. - I was with Camomile, cleaning up after the séance, and this monster killed me.<eos> A monster?<eos> I didn't get a good look at it, but it was big.
What?<eos> I'm an only child.<eos> Cora lied to you, Regina.<eos> I'm your sister.<eos> Half, if you want to get technical.<eos> Why should I believe anything you say?<eos> Oh, well, you shouldn't.<eos> It's a lot to swallow, which is why I've brought a gift to help.<eos> I don't want a gift from you.<eos> Oh, but you shall have it.
Not today.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm still alive, aren't I?<eos> Gold disappeared.<eos> We thought that meant...<eos> She defeated me?<eos> Hardly.<eos> You won?<eos> Well, don't act so surprised. As it turns out, Zelena wanted my heart.<eos> It's a good thing I wasn't stupid enough to bring it with me.

As it turns out, Zelena wanted my heart.<eos> It's a good thing I wasn't stupid enough to bring it with me.<eos> Any idea why she wants it?
For what?<eos> I do not know.<eos> I am Hundred Eyes.<eos> I am kept here to train the Khan's sons... his nobles... his pets.<eos> You shall be tutored in the Mongolian ways of the horse.<eos> You shall be tutored in the great arts of the East... by those scholars and artisans loyal to Lord Kublai.<eos> Languages and letters.<eos> Hawking and archery.<eos> And in the end... you may discover the answer to your question.<eos> A man found in possession of a stolen horse... must return it to its owner, add nine horses of the same kind.
Chief, are you busy?<eos> What's that?<eos> Said, "Are you busy?"<eos> Got a request for your attendance.<eos> Can it wait?<eos> I just ate an omelet.<eos> Waiting for it to digest.<eos> Oh, yeah? What kind?<eos> Well, it was mushrooms and cheese.<eos> - Sally make it?

I mean, we did--<eos> I mean, 22 people did get killed, and we were sitting in the car like a couple of--<eos> Yeah, we're okay.<eos> We're all right.<eos> Never heard of a deaf hit man.<eos> Carolina Murphy had his tongue cut out by an Indian back in the '80s.<eos> He worked a little after that but never quite the same.<eos> And Buzz Mead-- you know Buzz?<eos> He was born with just a socket.<eos> Used to take his glass eye out at parties and drop it in his drink.
I can go back.<eos> Nah, it's okay. I think we got some left from last time.<eos> Go get changed up, you, and let's eat.<eos> - I'm starving. - Yeah.<eos> Why don't you just put 'em on the table?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thanks, Greta. Okay.<eos> Dad wants to know about the game Sunday.<eos> Watch his place or...<eos> I thought we could watch it here.
You talk to Marjorie lately?<eos> It scares me, the way your mind works.<eos> - You expecting anybody?<eos> - Nope.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - What do I think of what?<eos> - Your new car.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> No, no.<eos> I got it at a police auction.

It would seem there is already one here.<eos> What have I done wrong?<eos> - The dinosaur doesn't seem very happy.<eos> -What's wrong with it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The Doctor's the one that speaks dinosaur.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am, the wife doesn't like to be kept waiting.<eos> Where did he get that face?<eos> Why has it got lines on it? It's brand-new.<eos> How can his hair be all grey? He only just got it.
My face is fresh on, though.<eos> Why this one?<eos> Why did I choose this face?<eos> It's like I'm trying to tell myself something.<eos> Like I'm trying to make a point.<eos> But what is so important that I can't just tell myself what I'm thinking?<eos> I'm not just being rhetorical here. - You can join in.<eos> -I don't like it.<eos> - What? -Your face!<eos> Well, I don't like it, either.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> -Why did you invite us?<eos> The message in the paper.<eos> That was you, wasn't it?<eos> Oh.<eos> I hate being wrong in public, everybody forget that happened.<eos> - Clara, say the word.<eos> -What word? They never sent you in here without a word.<eos> - I don't want to say it.
Nice to meet you, detective.<eos> How can I be of help?<eos> Never mind her.<eos> Go on, detective.<eos> Maybe we can talk outside.<eos> Okay.<eos> What on earth?<eos> Who brought a horse in here?<eos> It's been wandering around the neighborhood.<eos> It looked cold and hungry, so the neighbors brought it in.
So Nancy Wood wears a leather jacket.<eos> I'm thinking punk rock.<eos> Or biker chick.<eos> You should search the records for "motorcycle accident"... and Woman" and see what comes up.<eos> You are a regular Nancy Drew.<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> Nancy. What?<eos> I just wanted you to know that I got you that dress you liked.<eos> Well, I don't want ii anymore.<eos> What happened? I thought you loved it.
Wow, thanks.<eos> I mean, you look better than when you were dying.<eos> Swingin' and a-missin', Ward.<eos> It's great to see you better.<eos> I was so stupid to go in there alone.<eos> Hey, there's no point in doing that now.<eos> You were brave.<eos> Thanks to you, every S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the country knows Mike Peterson's alive.<eos> You tell them about his magic leg?<eos> I didn't call it that, but, yes.
And Lorelei wants me to go down to the basement, keep an eye on the girls downstairs.<eos> Already locked them in.<eos> Cannot have them mucking up Lorelei's plan.<eos> She's the best.<eos> Isn't she, sir?<eos> Yep.<eos> She's something else.<eos> Aren't you the brave one?<eos> You took my plane.<eos> I want it back.
I understand why you had to punch me.<eos> And I forgive you.<eos> Could I get a moment alone with Skye, please?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know that face, and something gives me the feeling I should be sitting down for this.<eos> I've been looking for a way to tell you this.<eos> Looking around for some answers, something to help explain...<eos> But I don't have any.<eos> The drug, the one that saved us both...<eos> When we found it, I discovered something else.
Also, two customers just showed up.<eos> We don't need their money!<eos> We're big, fat liars pretending to be poor too.<eos> Mm, yeah, my mom invented dogs.<eos> Any time someone buys a dog, we get 10%!<eos> Now I can't believe it.<eos> Even after three years with me as a friend, you still have a thing against rich people.<eos> Mm-hmm, I do, because rich people suck.<eos> They think they're better than everyone and are generally sucky.<eos> So he has money, I don't want it.
My first wesen.<eos> Not that some wesen aren't more bestial than others.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> You saw how messed up I was.<eos> Put a few bullet holes in the closet, couldn't sleep without my shotgun, but once Nick explained things...<eos> and you did too... took some getting used to, but here I am.<eos> That's because Nick was your partner.<eos> You already trusted him.<eos> Yeah, I mean, if I hadn't already been connected to Nick's world and loved him and trusted him, I don't know what my reaction would have been.<eos> Yeah, but your life's a lot better now that you know, isn't it?
Maybe, but I like this one.<eos> You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over for transport to the Fridge.<eos> Agent Antoine Triplett, Agent Philip Coulson.<eos> You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Phil's one of our finest.<eos> An honor, sir.<eos> Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus.<eos> - Go secure the prisoner.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Phil, come on.<eos> Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane, doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
Get off the ground immediately.<eos> They're alive.<eos> Maybe we can...<eos> Fitz, come in. What's your status?<eos> GARRETT;<eos> Phil. Phil, What the hell?<eos> Clock's not slowing down. It's about to get really warm in here.<eos> Hey. You with me?<eos> The guys are out already. They took the drug up to Skye.<eos> No. Don't give it to her.
May God watch over you all.<eos> Goodbye, Recep.<eos> Go and return like water.<eos> What are you doing, Mualla?<eos> Just look at this car.<eos> I thought it was clean. I didn't realize.<eos> What do you mean, Mualla?<eos> You splashed dirty water on the car.<eos> Halit pees and craps in that bucket.<eos> And you splash it on the car.
I'm here to bury fake Oonan the Barbarians.<eos> My name is Recep Ivedik.<eos> And that's that.<eos> Oongratulations to the red team.<eos> Taylan and Eda from the blue team and Recep and Gaye from the red team will now compete.<eos> Take your places.<eos> - Irfan?<eos> - Yes?<eos> I hurt my leg in the last contest.<eos> I don't want to strain it worse.
Down another notch.<eos> - Another notch?<eos> - Lower it one more.<eos> We're lowering it another notch.<eos> Recep, you'll wind up in the hospital.<eos> - Lower it another one.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> He's egging me on.<eos> Take it down another notch.<eos> OK, we're lowering it another notch.
I have a gift for you.<eos> A going-away present? Nope.<eos> A second-day anniversary present.<eos> What is it?<eos> Epictetus.<eos> The stoic.<eos> "A man should be prepared to be sufficient unto himself."<eos> It's one of my favorites.<eos> I know.<eos> Where'd you find it?

If I was gonna kill Nell, I would've done it on another night.<eos> Of course, my client is joking.<eos> Ms. Lanzer, do you know the name of the man that Nell started seeing after she broke up with Nicholas Orman?<eos> I've reached out to several members of the company.<eos> No one seems to know who he is.<eos> Nell and I weren't close... but to the best of my knowledge, she wasn't seeing anyone<eos> And if Nicholas told you otherwise, he's probably trying to deflect suspicion.<eos> Uh, Mr. Orman has an alibi for the time of the murder, unlike you.<eos> Not to mention the fact that it was your box cutter that was used as the murder weapon.<eos> I told you, someone must have taken it from my dressing room.
Not while I still breathe.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Despite all evidence to the contrary, you cling to the delusion that you will prevail.<eos> Don't tell me you still believe in that God of yours.<eos> So where is He?<eos> Why has He done nothing?<eos> Face the truth.<eos> He is nothing but a figment of your imagination.<eos> Your arrest report says you were apprehended with an antique sword.<eos> - Is it Sardu's?

So, this is what love looks like.<eos> You're supposed to be looking for Donaldson.<eos> And this is what needing a green card looks like, or having a shotgun wedding.<eos> Right, so love is bogus, flowers are hideous, and let me guess, you hated the chocolates, too.<eos> Good news, our vow renewal package includes bouquets and boutonnieres for our wedding party.<eos> Where's Vincent?<eos> Oh, he just went out to check the perimeter, make sure you're safe.<eos> But we're, uh...<eos> We're up next.<eos> This thing must be set by remote, which means Sam can detonate it at any moment.
Joel used to put a hole in an English muffin and pretend it was a bagel, and now you're eating one to fill a hole in your heart.<eos> Joel?<eos> Who's Joel?<eos> Yeah, forget the English muffin. Just give me some pie.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Zoe, great news, I hope.<eos> The renovation on your and Joel... Your house is done.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - I assume you want to put it on the market.
- I'm looking for Mr. Donnelly?<eos> Sean Donnelly?<eos> - I'm not available.<eos> - I've come about a long-term job.<eos> - At Radcliffe.<eos> - Yeah, wow, how do you know that?<eos> - You're the American banker's designer from London.<eos> - Why do I get the feeling you don't approve?<eos> - I don't mind who lives in that house.<eos> Just don't want to be the one who turns it into Disneyland.
- I don't mind who lives in that house.<eos> Just don't want to be the one who turns it into Disneyland.<eos> - That's not what we're doing.<eos> - Is it true he hasn't even set foot in the place, that he bought it on the Internet?<eos> - Well, he doesn't want to see it until it's fully restored to the original state.<eos> - Many of those skills are long gone, Miss...?<eos> - Hamilton.<eos> Meg.<eos> - And what do you know about Yorkshire stone?<eos> - I know that if you try and fix a bronze dial plate by F. Baker and Sons to a Mark Blanchard pedestal using hydrated cement paste, it'll probably corrode in the next 3 years.
I may be able to help.<eos> - I don't need any help, thank you.<eos> - Word spreads pretty fast round Malton, good as well as bad.<eos> If we can dispel superstition, encourage people to regard Radcliffe with fascination rather than fear, you may be able to restore it to the status it deserves.<eos> I'm a historian, Mrs. Hamilton.<eos> Believe me, you need my expertise.<eos> Good heavens.<eos> - The glass is 1860, but I think the design is a lot earlier.<eos> - It goes back to the ancients.<eos> - You know what it is?

But now I see it's just the size of two cows<eos> Fix up the boat to sail out again<eos> What?<eos> - The ship is crushed!<eos> - How do we catch the whale now?<eos> Aim it carefully!<eos> Let's go catch the whale!<eos> We're stealing that naval ship?<eos> You can't sail a ship that big by yourself<eos> Why steal it when you can't move it?
Zeppelin, hendrix, die hard.<eos> Total classics head over here.<eos> I'm joking, obviously.<eos> I know what the classics are.<eos> The odyssey and... The one you said when we got here, The wolf one.<eos> (holt) kevin, why don't we go mingle And let the detectives settle in?<eos> Boyle, what happened to your shirt?<eos> I spilled a wonderful winter salsa.<eos> Here, wear my shirt.<eos> I was gonna take it off anyway.
Only 'cause you yelled it.<eos> Shut up.<eos> From now on, we play to our strengths.<eos> Charles, you know everything about food.<eos> That's all you talk about.<eos> Will ever know everything about food.<eos> It's an evolving discipline.<eos> That's great stuff.<eos> It's so boring.<eos> Don't waste it.
Now pull, Mats.<eos> So cool!<eos> Hey! Did you just drop that two-euro coin?<eos> Yeah dude! I saw it myself.<eos> It just slipped out of your pocket.<eos> Here... Maybe you can surprise someone with an ice cream.<eos> I got you an ice lolly.<eos> You want it?<eos> Lower it down.<eos> Cover it with leaves.
I feel responsible for her.<eos> It was the year of the great storm.<eos> My father came home through the floods with a newborn in his arms.<eos> He wanted to see if he could correct her face.<eos> "Correct" it? As the villagers said, "She was kissed by the devil."<eos> You mean she had a birthmark?<eos> Going up along one cheek.<eos> The mother insisted the mark be removed.<eos> And my father... liked to experiment.<eos> He tried to remove it.
I can see how you might suspect I had planted the evidence.<eos> But as it happens, you've had two guards accompanying me wherever I go.<eos> How ironic that they are now my witnesses.<eos> Bellows?<eos> Is it true?<eos> Did you see the queen find this object?<eos> Yes, my lord.<eos> She told us to come in and witness that everything was above board.<eos> That thing was in a chest on the table.<eos> Queen Catherine didn't plant it there.
Please excuse the trouble my brother has caused.<eos> Here's the sum he owes, plus interest.<eos> How lucky you are to have such a lovely sister Willing to go to such lengths to secure your release.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Unfortunately, this debt Is more complicated.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> In addition to lying about his means, Your brother attempted to cheat at my tables,<eos> A very serious breach of house rules.<eos> Perhaps an additional sum would help smooth things over.<eos> Such a grave crime requires more than money To repay it, don't you think?
- So?<eos> - It was very late.<eos> If you're back with him, I think it's a mistake.<eos> I know the château you claim to stay at in Angers where you ran into Francis.<eos> It burned down last year.<eos> I don't know what happened between the two of you, but I can guess, so please don't counsel me on mistakes.<eos> Come along, girls, be of service to your queen.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Why are you singing that song?<eos> I was told to sing it near you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Are you sure this is a good idea?<eos> You said you wanted to take action, so we're taking action.<eos> - Well...<eos> - Mary Margaret our grandson would rather spend time with a pirate than us, but not after today.<eos> It's dangerous... not to mention illegal!<eos> It couldn't be safer. And as far as legality, I'm the sheriff.<eos> So, are you sure this is okay?<eos> Well, if Killian can teach you how to steal a boat, I can teach you how to drive.<eos> Technically, we borrowed it.
Six of one, half off the other.<eos> I'm not sure this is something we should be celebrating.<eos> Come on, you have loved every chapter in our book of forbidden trysts.<eos> That magical night in the handicapped stall at Chili's.<eos> The time we put a scare into that field trip of sixth graders at the planetarium when they saw Uranus.<eos> That weekend that Larry went back east and we went "down south."<eos> Alan... I don't have time for this.<eos> Well, then open your present.<eos> Spoiler alert: it's my penis and two of his friends.<eos> And you can't return it if it's the wrong size.
Some people find writing useful.<eos> Putting down thoughts, whatever they may be.<eos> Reading the entries you made might help.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I want to remember, I really do.<eos> I know.<eos> My diary was in a drawer in my bedroom.<eos> Yes.<eos> He was waiting for me in my bedroom.<eos> If he was wearing gloves, he could've read it and not left any prints?

It's also possible that this could all be our fault.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Hasn't it occurred to you that she might have been taken, by him?<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> I don't know... to silence her?<eos> What if we've exposed her to danger from that man by getting her to talk to you about the past?<eos> 'Are you keeping a journal?<eos> It's my diary from before.<eos> The idea is it's supposed to help me remember more about what happened to me.<eos> And has it helped?

Well, maybe it will help.<eos> Or maybe it won't.<eos> We all know people who live too much in the past.<eos> Too much history, too much remembering, can ultimately destroy the present and the future.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's been really useful.<eos> Good.<eos> It's getting too long.<eos> It's annoying me.<eos> Use that hairband to put it back.

- Tell me.<eos> - No.<eos> Let me do it with you.<eos> Please.<eos> - You're not ready.<eos> - I am.<eos> I am ready for anything.<eos> You think I'm a little girl, but I'm not.<eos> Ask me to do anything and I will.<eos> Create a fake e-mail account, use it to create a video chat account.
That's the target's wife arriving at the house in the Volvo.<eos> Control.<eos> Target's wife arriving at house.<eos> X-ray One, wait out.<eos> That man was on his back, more or less as he's lying now.<eos> Then he made a move, raised his gun.<eos> That's when the male officer fired again.<eos> Two more shots.<eos> Now just bring the wrist up.<eos> Don't let me push it forward.
In your own words.<eos> I want to hear it from you.<eos> Most nights when I baby-sat, Paul would walk me home.<eos> 'We'd walk for ages just talking about music and poetry.'<eos> 'He's read so many books, he knows so much about art and literature.'<eos> I write and record songs.<eos> We started talking about music.<eos> He listens mainly to blues music.<eos> I wrote a song for him.<eos> I played it to him one night in his study.
Can't take any more lone men into New York. What do you... you mean I can't continue on?<eos> Not alone.<eos> He tell you his name?<eos> No.<eos> Please don't think that I condone such barbarism.<eos> Just... miss my boy, is all.<eos> You have a son?<eos> His birthday's comin' round.<eos> Well, then, we must send him something.<eos> If you think of a gift, I'll make arrangements to have it sent by special courier.
Or else what?<eos> Lord, watch over Farrah today as she talks to her boss about moving from weather to news, and may she finally be respected for that beautiful mind you gave her and not just those beautiful boobs.<eos> We thank you for them, Lord, and for this food.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Honey, slow down.<eos> You have plenty of time to get ready.<eos> She is ready.<eos> But thanks for the ego boost.<eos> Amy, I'm sorry, but you have such gorgeous hair, and you just let it hang there limp.
I am overflowing with joy.<eos> I didn't realize you told your parents.<eos> How did your mother take the news?<eos> She can be a little...<eos> What's the word? - Unevolved.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I haven't told her yet.<eos> Well, if she kicks you out, you can always stay here.<eos> This is a safe space.<eos> Now let's get a pic of you two, so I can send it to your brother Zen in the Peace Corps.
'Cause you will.<eos> I was hoping that he'd try it on himself instead.<eos> Well, he's not stupid. He's mean, but he's not stupid.<eos> I'm not doing what he wants.<eos> Yeah, well, then he's gonna kill you and he's gonna kill your beast.<eos> Yeah. They know you got one.<eos> They sent out a ransom.<eos> I heard them. You for it.<eos> That's why they want to make the serum.<eos> They want to combine it with beast blood.
Technically, I can only repay it by saving your life in return, but since that's probably never gonna happen,<eos> Except I'm the reason why your life was in danger in the first place, which should cancel out any credit I have for saving it.<eos> Normally true, but in this case, I am the real reason I got kidnapped.<eos> Thought after eight years of trying, I'd actually won that stupid grant, so it was really my fault.<eos> Still, Barnes used you to get to me, so technically it is my fault.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> But they also wanted my beast-serum-making expertise, thank you very much.<eos> It's not always all about you, you know.<eos> Speaking of which... did you ever figure out how to make that serum?<eos> I don't know. I never got a chance to try it.
Get that tattoo removed now.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> Right now our P.E. teaching position has been filled.<eos> I can be a teaching assistant.<eos> I can do arts and crafts.<eos> Photo copying, sending faxes.<eos> I will do anything.<eos> If you don't remove it, I will move you to our houseboat school.
Stop it.<eos> Muek you already have one.<eos> Pink is mine.<eos> Don't fight over it.<eos> I bought one for each of you.<eos> I wrote down your problems to solve.<eos> C'mon.<eos> It's getting close to exam time.<eos> The kids still act like they have a stomachache when it's time to math problems.<eos> Not only the kids, before I can teach the kids even 1 problem I have to hide out in the restroom to solve it first.
But we can't very well remain hidden when we are publicly biting, fucking and sucking the vintner's daughter.<eos> Well, what can I say?<eos> If feels better in the moonlight.<eos> Then get a room with a window and let the moon shine in.<eos> I take it you've both heard of the Yakonomo Corporation?<eos> - Japanese pharmaceuticals?<eos> - Correct.<eos> The Authority and Yakonomo Corp. have joined forces in the development and bringing to market of a synthetic human blood substitute drink.<eos> Sounds delicious.<eos> I've tasted it and you would be correct.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.<eos> Actually, it does.<eos> Death is inherently sad.<eos> I'm sad.<eos> I'm not in the mood for a party.<eos> Sook.<eos> Sook.<eos> Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?<eos> About how this house was feeling so empty?<eos> That's why we gonna fill it up.
- No?<eos> - She's the antidote, Eric.<eos> She can heal you.<eos> This isn't about capture and kill anymore.<eos> - This is about capture and--<eos> - Capture and exploit.<eos> You're a capitalist, yes?<eos> I have a business proposition for you.<eos> All right, we're listenin.<eos> Together we track down Ms. Newlin we capture her and we synthesize her blood and we bottle it and distribute it worldwide as a product:
- Jesus Christ, sis.<eos> You can't just dye your hair and blow a guru and absolve yourself of all the horrific shit that you have done in your life.<eos> See, that's where you're wrong because he showed me that all of this happened for a reason.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> All of this was meant to be.<eos> If I hadn't created Hep-U, then you wouldn't be sick and I wouldn't be here right now with the ability to heal you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> There was an antidote, Amber.<eos> And I drank it.<eos> When the vampires revolted from the facility the scientists had created an antidote to Hep-V and I drank it down.
If you want to listen to it, then you can feel free to, but do it outside.<eos> And go out there knowing if you walk out on me now you and me are through.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I'm sorry, Brigette.<eos> Jessica?<eos> You wanna tell me what's going on?<eos> Bill released me tonight.<eos> Jesus, I'm sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> There's a cure but he wouldn't drink it.
Gone.<eos> Are you healed?<eos> Well, I can't tell you how but I came looking for you because I wanted you to know I'm gonna be okay.<eos> Bill's sick.<eos> What?<eos> Hep-V.<eos> He has it.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Is there something you're not understanding?<eos> If there's a cure, he needs it.
Legally speaking, with your grandmother not fit and all you're my eldest remaining heir.<eos> We're family, remember?<eos> You and I.<eos> I remember.<eos> When I found out I was unwell, I went to see an attorney see if I could will my home to Jessica.<eos> It's kind of a long story, but it turns out that I can't.<eos> Which means that when I die this house will pass over to you.<eos> I can't accept this house.<eos> For all kinds of reasons.<eos> I'm asking if you will rent it to Jessica and Hoyt for the sum of one dollar a month.
God, I could never write a book.<eos> I love reading, though.<eos> Guess what my favorite book is.<eos> Anna Karenina.<eos> No.<eos> Peter Pan.<eos> All children grow up except one.<eos> You know it.<eos> Of course.<eos> I read it to my kids.
Where's the woman who's supposed to be protecting you?<eos> That's an interesting story.<eos> Turns out that woman is Nick's mother.<eos> - What?<eos> - Imagine my surprise.<eos> Did she know who you were?<eos> If she had, she wouldn't have taken me to Nick's house.<eos> Imagine their surprise.<eos> - I'm going to get that baby.<eos> What, you're just gonna walk in there and take it?
Hey, guys.<eos> Bertie's playing it cool, but you guys coming over for dinner tonight is a really big deal to her, so... Be there by 6, and no bailing.<eos> Ooh, bailing on dinner.<eos> Nick, I need you.<eos> Wingman sitch.<eos> Jewish girl, sensible nose.<eos> High-level target.<eos> I can't be your wingman.<eos> We got to go this Bertie dinner.<eos> Don't make it seem like a chore, okay?
I think you've allowed yourself to become a bit of a fool.<eos> But in spite of that...<eos> I can't believe you're so far gone you'd allow yourself to be involved in a murder.<eos> Right, so, what?<eos> You... you break in my safe, do you?<eos> I have video of you dismantling the security camera at the Griffin Hotel.<eos> I've got e-mails which confirm you knew about Lawrence Iver's plans to stage a coup at Whitbrook-Balsille.<eos> Oh, so, I see.<eos> So I didn't actually leave my phone at your house, did I?<eos> No, no, you nicked it.
If you know the seating arrangement, and you're the one building the explosive, you can-- and she did-- arrange things so that her wounds were relatively minor.<eos> Once Antonelli was gone, Forrester had his title and access to the jobs report.<eos> All the pieces were in place.<eos> She could make the blackmail threat.<eos> To do that, she would have to know about me.<eos> Amazing.<eos> So, the name, the photograph-- nothing rings a bell?<eos> When Miss Forrester left college, she came here.<eos> She won an internship with Whitbrook-Balsille.<eos> After completing it, she moved into a brand-new and fully-paid-for apartment in Georgetown, and took a plum appointment at the Department of Labor.
Had.<eos> Barry.<eos> The two of us were Adam Peer together.<eos> The murder victim Barry Granger.<eos> I would never have hurt him.<eos> And you already know he didn't hurt himself.<eos> I'm sorry, but... if you thought Adam Peer killed him... you were wrong.<eos> I already told your consultants this e-mail didn't come from us.<eos> I didn't send it, and Barry obviously didn't discredit himself.<eos> Someone hijacked our pseudonym and used it to attack Barry's study.
Sure.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I'm the manager, remember?<eos> We met when you paid me six months in advance?<eos> I mean, normally, I have to chase people just to get their last month's.<eos> And you really can't have glass bottles out here.<eos> It breaks, you gotta drain the whole pool.<eos> God.<eos> You are so drunk.<eos> My life wasn't bad enough already. You had to make it worse.
I lost her shortly afterwards.<eos> Shortly?<eos> She's good.<eos> Gave no sign she'd even made me.<eos> Hmm. You think anybody on her detail will play ball with us?<eos> Well, they just got here.<eos> Find out.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And that, uh, photo of Farhad Ghazi-- I'd never seen it before.<eos> Looked like a frame grab of some kind-- see if you can track down where she got it from.
Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Who was she going away with?<eos> The husband or the lover?<eos> We're not sure Hedi Himer was Manon Villers' lover.<eos> Have I missed something?<eos> In her diary, Manon describes a certain H.H.<eos> with erotic detail, but we can't say if it's just a fantasy or if they had an affair.<eos> Hold on, what's all this about a diary?<eos> Where did you get it?
with erotic detail, but we can't say if it's just a fantasy or if they had an affair.<eos> Hold on, what's all this about a diary?<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> From a box at Villers' house.<eos> He was throwing out her things.<eos> Tell me you had a search warrant.<eos> Right?<eos> No, but he didn't notice a thing.<eos> This is totally irresponsible.<eos> We can't use it now, because of how you obtained it.

- Why didn't you answer your phone?<eos> - Was it you?<eos> - Yes, it was me.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry. - Sorry.<eos> - It's OK.<eos> ls it really that fascinating, the life of...<eos> - Marion, was it?<eos> - Manon.<eos> Give it back.<eos> Give it to me.
He could have changed before calling it in.<eos> He said he put on pyjamas when he got in, but later he was in a tracksuit.<eos> Or someone else ﬁred the shot.<eos> Who?<eos> Himer?<eos> - He wasn't far way.<eos> - Neither was Villers' father.<eos> He has a key to his son's house.<eos> He probably didn't like seeing Manon kissing an Arab.<eos> He's got a riﬂe, and he would use it.
Then there was a lot of foot-stomping and cane-snapping and monocle-smashing.<eos> Who is your wedding photographer -- Mr. Peanut?<eos> It's a director of --<eos> - It's a wedding.<eos> - Sorry I'm late.<eos> Jim Perlowe, this is my sister, Claire Dunphy.<eos> Hi. A pleasure to meet you.<eos> Listen, I went by the construction site this morning, and those condos are gonna be fantastic -- assuming, of course, you get the right closets and blinds.<eos> Appears the meeting has already started, so, okay!<eos> Yes, it has!
Hey, guys.<eos> For my opening number tonight-- Be honest.<eos> Does it look like I have anything on under this?<eos> Tonight is the SCARB.<eos> Southern California Annual Realtors' Banquet.<eos> It is the banquet for southern California realtors.<eos> Literally, it's the only one.<eos> And this guy is the only two-time host -- Three-time.<eos> Three-time host in the history of the event.<eos> Unfortunately, I have to miss it this year.
What was that outfit last night?<eos> That was a business dinner!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Wendy, I tried.<eos> Well, try harder.<eos> Ooh, here's your office.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, this is nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dennis liked it... until he didn't.
When I get done talking to her, not only will she have confessed to the crime,<eos> I might even sell her a closet.<eos> I remember my buddies and I were playing rock war once.<eos> That's a game where you chuck rocks at each other's heads.<eos> What could go wrong, right?<eos> I put one through the window of my old man's Rambler, and he thought my baby brother did it.<eos> I couldn't take it, and I told him I did it.<eos> It felt so good to confess, and my old man was so proud of me, I didn't even get in any trouble.<eos> Y-you know?<eos> Joe did it.
Damn it.<eos> She's been stewing in there for an hour.<eos> I say let's lock the door, cut the power.<eos> Let's show her that we mean business.<eos> Let's try the joint approach first...<eos> Okay, we've been going over your story, and it doesn't add up.<eos> My purse was too high for Joe to reach.<eos> He's tall enough to reach up here.<eos> He knocked over the baby powder trying to get my stuffed animals.<eos> Not buying it.
Chores?<eos> What kind of --<eos> There he is.<eos> Attaboy!<eos> Attaboy!<eos> A beer?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Where you going?<eos> You want some?<eos> He'll bring it to you.
Pig!<eos> Sex pest, you should be ashamed!<eos> You pig!<eos> - You're disgusting!<eos> You big pig!<eos> - You disgusting sex pest!<eos> You should be ashamed!<eos> That was fun!<eos> "Sator arepo tenet opera rotas, Sator arepo tenet opera rotas...<eos> Write the formula on a piece of paper and keep it in your pocket until full moon.
Okay, but put your braces on. Then go to sleep, okay?<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Is your mother home?<eos> Mum, it's for you!<eos> A registered letter, miss. Addressed to you and Mr. Guido Bernadotte, do you accept?<eos> Sign here, please.<eos> Thank you, have a nice day.<eos> You're under arrest, Miss.<eos> In this letter from a one Manuel Ginori in Bolivia, there's cocaine.<eos> The dogs sniffed it out.
Is your mother home?<eos> Mum, it's for you!<eos> A registered letter, miss. Addressed to you and Mr. Guido Bernadotte, do you accept?<eos> Sign here, please.<eos> Thank you, have a nice day.<eos> You're under arrest, Miss.<eos> In this letter from a one Manuel Ginori in Bolivia, there's cocaine.<eos> The dogs sniffed it out.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Who sent it?
Was anyone hurt?<eos> I want this one...<eos> Luckily, no.<eos> Again, I must apologize.<eos> You trusted me, and I let you down.<eos> No, you didn't. Nothing's worth the loss of a child.<eos> But now we have a problem.<eos> I'm alive. I don't follow.<eos> She has my heart.<eos> Gold's taken it for her, and since she hasn't crushed it and killed me, that means she needs it for something far worse.
This is all useless crap.<eos> Hey, hey...<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> Stop it!<eos> What... What are you looking for?<eos> I need to destroy my sister.<eos> She has my heart.<eos> Oh, relax.<eos> She can't control me with it.<eos> I protected it from that.
Hey, stop!<eos> Stop it!<eos> What... What are you looking for?<eos> I need to destroy my sister.<eos> She has my heart.<eos> Oh, relax.<eos> She can't control me with it.<eos> I protected it from that.<eos> The problem is...<eos> I don't know what she's planning on using it for, which is why I need to take her out.
Bookworm's got teeth.<eos> Get out.<eos> Yes I did all those horrible things...<eos> In the past. But right now, I need something to defeat the woman who's puppet-mastering your boyfriend.<eos> She has your Rumple, and unless you help me, you may never see him again.<eos> I'm sorry, Belle.<eos> I really, really am.<eos> So, I've been trying to match the ingredients that Zelena's been collecting to whatever spell she intends to cast.<eos> It would really help if I knew what is so special about your heart.<eos> Does she just want it because you're sisters, or...
Come on, let's go.<eos> You know what?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm gonna stay and talk to Regina.<eos> I'll help clean up.<eos> I'm not in the mood for a heart-to-heart.<eos> I'm not sure that's physically possible right now.<eos> You can help with the tea cups.<eos> There it was, my oldest night dress.<eos> The boys tied it to the top of the windmill, it's flapping in the wind for the whole village to see,
Sooner or later, your heart will find its way to happiness.<eos> That doesn't feel possible.<eos> But it is.<eos> I know you, and you feel things deeply.<eos> With or without it, you feel things with your whole soul.<eos> Don't let anything hold you back.<eos> My lady.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I let you down.<eos> Your heart was lost to Zelena on my watch, but I promise you, I will get it back.
You don't want to go into early labor.<eos> Stay away from my wife!<eos> Someone's testy.<eos> Enough, sis.<eos> This is between you and me.<eos> Now let's see if this was all worth it.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> This child shall do quite nicely.<eos> So take good care of it for me.
You... you remember?<eos> I've seen the movie a million times.<eos> It's quite a common name in the seafaring world.<eos> As luck would have it, he's making sail to New York and would be happy for the company.<eos> I am?<eos> I mean...<eos> I am. Really?<eos> Where's your ship?<eos> Um... there she is.<eos> You're stealing it, right?
Hurry up now.<eos> Nod if you agree.<eos> Come on, boys. Drink up.<eos> Drink up, now. Come on.<eos> Come on, boys.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> It's freezing out here. Yeah.<eos> What's that?<eos> Silverware.<eos> I'd rather you have it than Hewlett or your father.
- I mean, I'll actually kill you, okay?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I need a location.<eos> Okay...<eos> He took-- he took my car.<eos> They called me, told me it was impounded in Duluth.<eos> So he's probably--<eos> I got a picture-- There's a picture of him.<eos> Picture of him up here.<eos> Law enforcement, he had it.
Yeah?<eos> Let me talk to him.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I was hunting.<eos> I heard about the bugs.<eos> You need me to swing by?<eos> It's too late now.<eos> I'm- - I'm gonna pay.<eos> The blackmail.<eos> I'm gonna pay it.
A million do--<eos> Hey, uh, how big is that?<eos> A million dollars?<eos> Does it fit into a suitcase?<eos> Or like-- like, a sack or something?<eos> It's gotta be-- it's gotta be pretty heavy, right?<eos> Hey, can I-- can I lay in it?<eos> You know, I always liked that part of movies where the characters, they just lay in a big pile--<eos> - You got a drill?<eos> Oh, and then they always-- they always take the money and they just, like, throw it up in the air.
Stand clear of the closing doors, please. Stand clear of the closing doors.<eos> Attention passengers, the last stop of the 6 train headed toward Pelham Bay Park... is Third Avenue-138th Street.<eos> A230385.<eos> You really thought I would lead you to him?<eos> I warned you to stay in jail.<eos> Fitting that we should end our journey where it began- on a train platform.<eos> But this time, I'm the one with the weapon.<eos> Sardu's sword.<eos> The Master will be pleased to get ii back.<eos> Then come and take it.
Once I turn, I'm gonna go after them, right?<eos> - The ones you love.<eos> Release him.<eos> Do it now before it's too late.<eos> No!<eos> Okay.<eos> Will you tell your mom to call me, okay?<eos> None of this texting shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe her phone broke or she lost it?
Mourn Matt's passing.<eos> Life will insist.<eos> You mustn't fail life.<eos> A230385?<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> You are bereft after finishing that superb project.<eos> Yes.<eos> I've read artists are afflicted that way.<eos> The emptiness that follows when a great thing has been completed.<eos> The fear that you will never be able to replicate it.
Me too.<eos> Well, you remember my mother?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Hi.<eos> And, Adalind, this is Monroe and Rosalee.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Let's get you settled.<eos> So why are you doing this?<eos> The royals are after that child.<eos> And they'll kill to get it.
And you don't even know it.<eos> - Ahh. - Don't threaten me.<eos> Not after trying to kill me.<eos> That's just bad manners.<eos> Now do you see white lights or just color?<eos> Last number to have called you was from Vienna.<eos> Who was that from?<eos> I can just call it for you.<eos> I'm sure they'd love to hear from me on your phone.<eos> Turn it off.
- And where's Ruspoli now?<eos> - You're gonna wanna answer<eos> - that question. - Just kill him.<eos> On his way here.<eos> Alone?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - Is Viktor with him?<eos> Yes.<eos> All they want is the baby.<eos> Just give it up...
So, Doc, how we looking?<eos> Healthy kid, or is it gonna need a crash helmet?<eos> Everything looks great.<eos> You're right on schedule, six weeks out.<eos> Hey, we might still be able to go to Senior Prom.<eos> Think you can watch the baby?<eos> You're joking, right?<eos> The kid'll still be wet.<eos> You're right.<eos> We'll bring it.
I think his mother might actually be stuffed.<eos> Honey, look, I'm making you a tiara.<eos> Nice.<eos> Listen, I decided I don't want to have a party.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's a celebration!<eos> It's fun and games and free stuff for the baby.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> Sweetheart, I'm stealing food from the restaurant.<eos> Believe me, we need it.
What does Luke say about this?<eos> He doesn't know yet.<eos> Really?<eos> You have any advice?<eos> Maybe I'm not a life coach.<eos> Creme brulee?<eos> Thanks.<eos> I really want a drink right now.<eos> Shut up. You got pudding.<eos> If she's gonna put that baby up for adoption, I'll adopt it.
Oh, come on, don't pout.<eos> I'm sorry I ruined your game.<eos> I'm not pouting, I'm brooding.<eos> Which is how sexy men pout.<eos> It actually was kind of fun.<eos> You're just saying that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I liked the time travel element.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I thought it was inspired.
What you doing here?<eos> Come on, boys.<eos> I'm just here to see your mom. Yeah?<eos> Why, you want to do her?<eos> Yeah, loser, you gonna-- Wait.<eos> He's not really gonna have sex with our ma, is he? He better not.<eos> Nobody's--<eos> Goddamn it, get off the guy.<eos> And quit shooting up the lawn sign.<eos> Never gonna sell this place, you keep filling it with arrows.
What's this then?<eos> - Our suspect.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> Security camera caught him kidnapping' the naked fella.<eos> - Kidnapped him naked?<eos> - No, dressed.<eos> Phil McCormick.<eos> Our perp cut his clothes off in the parking garage.<eos> No kiddin'.<eos> Yeah, so here's the thing, I took the photo and I showed it to Lester. - Did what?
Okay. Fine.<eos> It was a little romantic, all right? And clearly I still have issues with Vincent.<eos> Clearly.<eos> It's just hard to let it go after everything we've been through.<eos> All the more reason why I need to stay away from him for a while.<eos> Gabe?<eos> Vincent. I need some space, see if there's actually a future with Gabe.<eos> Out of sight, out of mind, right?<eos> Yeah, well, that's easier said than done with all of us trying to bust Sam.<eos> Gabriel Lowan was a man of peace, a man who stood up to evil and faced it head-on.
Can't say I know yours.<eos> So I'll just call you a target of opportunity.<eos> Vigilance came here to interrogate Cyrus Wells, but now we're here for you.<eos> See, based on the way you fight, I think you were a clandestine operative for the good old US of A.<eos> But based on the people you protect, I think you're not anymore.<eos> And I'm guessing it's because they betrayed you.<eos> Are you guys gonna shoot again or just talk me to death?<eos> Well, actually I'm more interested in what you have to say.<eos> So I've taken the liberty of sealing off the exits.<eos> Now in exchange for everything you know about the Samaritan system and the people that are trying to build it,
It lists Cyrus as 1 of 15 people with retinal access.<eos> As in retinal scanner?<eos> So somewhere out there is a door, and Cyrus Wells' eye is the key.<eos> I believe I might know where that door is.<eos> After passing his background check at work, Cyrus became the only custodian allowed on the 19th floor.<eos> What's on the 19th floor?<eos> A company called Maxwell Limited.<eos> All I know about them so far is that they take regular deliveries of liquid helium.<eos> I'm guessing they're not blowing up balloons.<eos> Maxwell could be using it to cool anything from biomedical reactors to-- The fastest computer ever built.
But I know you'll make an exception for me.<eos> Really?<eos> And, uh, how do you know that?<eos> The same way I know I can put a bullet through your hand before you can dial 911.<eos> The same way I know you're the best otolaryngologist in 250 miles.<eos> Okay, uh, what do you want?<eos> Drugs? Not really.<eos> Although a little lidocaine would be nice. I didn't get any the last time.<eos> You see, somebody broke my ear.<eos> And you're gonna fix it.
A toast.<eos> To immortality.<eos> Immortality.<eos> - Immortality. - Immortality.<eos> Let's turn to "Update America" for the latest.<eos> Coming up next, a live exclusive from Carrie Cooke.<eos> Here we go, here we go!<eos> Tonight, I bring you an exclusive.<eos> You have already heard about the horrific murders at a book signing I was attending.<eos> During the attack, I was given the following video and told to share it with the world.
Now, that's about the best offer you're gonna get today, so I would take it.<eos> One, one thousand.<eos> Two, one thousand.<eos> Oh, Chelsea.<eos> Oh, Chelsea.<eos> I'm so sorry, Chelsea.<eos> Sorry for your loss.<eos> I'm having a private moment.<eos> Why don't you show some goddamn respect?<eos> - No disrespect intended, despite the fact that dog would have been happy to chew my face off and wear it as a Halloween mask.
How about you just go away and let me grieve in peace?<eos> That I can't do.<eos> But, see, you carry that duffel any further up to Audrey's, I'd be obliged to take Wendy and Kendal in as accessories.<eos> And that would suck.<eos> What about Darryl?<eos> Him, I don't give a rat's ass, but I'd just as soon eschew the collateral damage.<eos> Now, if you were to own up to the contents of that duffel right here, well, then, you'd be the only Crowe going away on this day of mourning.<eos> Do you see the favor?<eos> I do.<eos> And I appreciate it, sir.
And secondly, if you're implying I would use This conveyance without your express permission...<eos> That gauge right there doesn't lie.<eos> The odometer.<eos> Curse you, franklin,<eos> For inventing such a treacherous device.<eos> Crane, if we're gonna win this war, You need to master certain skills from this era.<eos> Ergo, you need to drive a damn car.<eos> So be it.<eos> Remember, all that power Is now a part of you.<eos> Make it your steed. Oh.
Yes, your soul is crying out for it.<eos> All I want is for you to go to hell, bitch!<eos> You do not have very nice manners, young lady.<eos> No! No!<eos> No!<eos> This is where they would've kept Mama's stuff.<eos> It's the archive room for the old wing.<eos> Mama's journal would be with her personal effects.<eos> Yo, Jenny.<eos> She kept it.
Yeah.<eos> I have to.<eos> As far as I can tell, irving and jenny Are still okay for now.<eos> You find anything here?<eos> In the book of enoch, There is the legend of methuselah.<eos> He was given a sword With the power to kill any being on earth.<eos> He used it to take down A thousand demons.<eos> So mama was right.<eos> The sword can kill moloch.<eos> If it can be found.
I know this.<eos> That journal was passed down from my ancestor to my mother. Now to me.<eos> It is my legacy.<eos> Maybe all the suffering, everything I've gone through, Leads up to this. A chance to finally<eos> It is why I'm here.<eos> Clarity of purpose is such a rare gift.<eos> Allowing katrina to contact ichabod through the mirror Has paid dividends.<eos> He seeks the sword of methuselah.<eos> The witnesses must not get their hands on it.<eos> You will follow them, And if they discover its resting place, You will retrieve it before they do.
It is one of these swords, right?<eos> 'cause if it's not and I die in here, I'll be kicking some serious templar ass in the afterlife.<eos> You find the sword.<eos> I shall hold off the victor in battle.<eos> No, crane. Not by yourself.<eos> You'll be killed.<eos> Even both of us together against them Does not appreciably narrow our odds.<eos> Not without the sword.<eos> I'll buy you as much time as I can.<eos> But you must find it, posthaste.
Hence the custom of giving hearts on Valentine's Day.<eos> Now single people everywhere have to drown their sorrows in tubs of Rocky Road.<eos> So, we must find a succubus' heart.<eos> It would have to be on consecrated ground.<eos> - Like a church or...<eos> - Or a cemetery.<eos> Remember the trace I put on Henry's online activity?<eos> A few days ago, he applied for a permit. Gives him access to the grounds at Shady Hills Cemetery.<eos> It's a pretty good place for hiding stuff, especially the vital organ of a demon.<eos> Once we find the heart, an immolation spell will destroy it.
- I'm sorry. - Just a little...<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Uh, but, anyway, the-the situation is...<eos> You know, say that one of your flock, uh, had developed feelings for the most spoiled, irritating and annoying sheep in town, and-and... he wants to rid himself of said feelings.<eos> George, it sounds like you need something to take your mind off this particular sheep, and I know just what it should be.<eos> Prayer.<eos> A date with our visiting Sunday school teacher.<eos> Oh, yeah. No.<eos> I mean, no offense, Reverend, but that-that is so not what I had in mind.<eos> Well, I think it's a great idea. And you know who also thinks so?
(weak chuckle)<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> Zoe, please, you've got to tell me.<eos> LulaBelle, why don't you tell George about your summer working as a counselor at Bible camp?<eos> Wow, Sunday school teacher all year round, and Bible camp in the summer-- that is so, uh...<eos> "Devout" is the word that you're looking for. That is.<eos> That is the word I was looking for.<eos> George also spent a summer working in Bible camp. Didn't you? I did.<eos> I did.<eos> I also found it to be extremely enlightening and, uh, and-and whatnot.
I think that's pretty likely.<eos> Okay.<eos> What would you do about it?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I don't think I'd do anything.<eos> I think I'd just stop.<eos> It's a zero-sum game.<eos> you just win until you lose again.<eos> It never ends.<eos> I'd just concentrate on having the best product and moving it.
Costa Rica.<eos> - In Costa Rica? - [laughs] Yeah.<eos> I have these friends, a married couple, and they own this funky hotel resort on this fantastic piece of property.<eos> You been down there? - To Costa Rica?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, but I hear it's amazing though.<eos> But so my friends, they're getting a divorce...<eos> Amicable, you know.<eos> But they need to cash out to split up.<eos> So they'll sell, which they really want to do, and if I get the money together, they'll sell it to me for about 60% of what it's actually worth.

I'm only 33, so--<eos> We're in the same generation.<eos> I'm 31. 31?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> But I call you "mister."<eos> And you wear a suit, and... That.<eos> Did you just point at my bald spot? No.<eos> Look.<eos> We're putting the apartment on the market.<eos> We need to get it ready for brokers to show.
What's wrong with you guys?<eos> I've lost control of my squad.<eos> (gina) should we turn some lights on?<eos> Trying to save electricity, gina.<eos> Your massage chair is on.<eos> Yeah, I'm poor. I'm not a savage.<eos> Man, what am I gonna do?<eos> Well, what if I bought the apartment?<eos> [scoffs] what are you talking about?<eos> And then I could rent it to you till you find A new place.
Since we're being...<eos> Intimate, let me ask, do you miss her?<eos> I mean, how often do you think about Claire?<eos> Good, because I miss her, Ryan.<eos> I really do.<eos> She will always be my one real regret.<eos> Well, I should be off.<eos> Feel like we should hug or something.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Well, enjoy the spectacle, and I hope you find it worthy.
I know your boss wanted to buy this place, but I've been stockpiling wolfsbane for months, and I just really needed a place to store it.<eos> Get back!<eos> Get back!<eos> I'm gonna need that.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Have I mentioned that I've had a rotten couple of months?<eos> You think you're strong because of that ring you wear?<eos> You're nothing.<eos> We were strong.<eos> We were part of a pack, and you ruined it.
I thought backstage was supposed to be restricted access.<eos> The benefits of having a district attorney's badge, I guess.<eos> You stop by to wish Moira good luck? I did.<eos> But I'm really glad I ran into you.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> I accused you of really terrible things.<eos> You were going through a very difficult time.<eos> I'm just happy you're on the mend.<eos> Good luck tonight.<eos> I'm not the one who's going to need it.
We can cut 12 weeks off Akley's timeline.<eos> I thought we were going to the airport.<eos> Lamy train depot.<eos> General's seen fit to ground me.<eos> It's too dangerous to fly.<eos> Isn't that right, Tommy?<eos> It's very touching, their concern for my health.<eos> It's been road-tested and triple-checked, Robert.<eos> If you'll just give me some IBM machines and 30 more men, I can have the hydrodynamics worked out in the next month.<eos> This country, the Valles Caldera, we call it a desert, but it's a crematorium.
THE POINT IS, I WANT TO TRY TO FIX THINGS, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW.<eos> I NEED HELP.<eos> WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.<eos> WHAT IF WE DOWNLOADED ANOTHER APP? YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT MAKES EVERYTHING ORDERED AND RIGHT.<eos> YEAH, LIKE ONE OF THOSE ORGANIZER APPS.<eos> EXACTLY.<eos> AND THEN WE'LL GRAB THE PHONE, DUNK IT IN WATER, AND THEN ZAP IT.<eos> AND THEN WE'LL THROW IT IN THE MICROWAVE.<eos> THERE'S ONE IN THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE.<eos> THEN WE'LL STICK IT IN DOG FOOD!
It could be the worst thing I ever did.<eos> But it might be the best.<eos> But anything worth doing in life requires taking a risk.<eos> If you stay in your comfort zone you never get anywhere.<eos> I wanna be in it.<eos> I wanna be in your project.<eos> You got me in!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Do you mind if I share a quote with you?<eos> I didn't, I found it in part of my research for the movie, but I'd love to read it to you.
What is that?<eos> MAN (OVER RADIO):<eos> I'll go back to camp to get more bullets.<eos> Why are you not there?<eos> Raven was shot.<eos> We need medicine to slow the bleeding.<eos> - You came to save one life?<eos> - I don't have time to explain.<eos> - Do you have the medicine or not?<eos> - I have it.
No. I...<eos> I think it's been a great game this week.<eos> I'm amazed at how great it is.<eos> Uh! Awesome!<eos> I thought you were gonna be mad. All right.<eos> I'm gonna go get the bad-ass knives from Schmidt's house.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Get 'em, girl.<eos> Um, guys, we have a problem.<eos> I know, but Abby's gonna fix it.
All right, I'm gonna read.<eos> Okay. Here we go.<eos> Yeah, it's...<eos> Just gonna put this on here.<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, this is my long shirt.<eos> That's why you're laughing.<eos> I had it on the wrong way.<eos> That must have been funny-looking the way it was.<eos> I've never broken it out before you because, you know, we didn't live together, but... it keeps the top really warm and lets my bottom breathe. - And so... yeah.
So-Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - What the hell is that nightmare? - I just... have to...<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Just reading. - Yeah.<eos> You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna sleep with my head over there.<eos> Yeah, that's... That's gonna be better for me.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna get some water.<eos> - My room looks totally different.<eos> Turned it into a workout space.
That's not comforting at all!<eos> Well, I just think it's pretty clear that we're all just bags of bones and flesh that eventually break down and decay into worm food.<eos> We come from nothing, and we're gonna become nothing. The end.<eos> Night, Stewie.<eos> Lights out.<eos> Did you hear him, Rupert?<eos> Life is just a big joke.<eos> It's just sitting around waiting to die.<eos> Well, I can't live like that.<eos> I'd rather just end it.
How 'bout that?<eos> And there we go.<eos> Hello?<eos> Daniel, what the hell did you get yourself into?<eos> They came to see you, didn't they?<eos> Yeah, some Neanderthal claiming to be an old pal of yours. And he wasn't the only one.<eos> About an hour ago, some couple-- a man and a woman-- stopped me outside my coffee joint, asking if I'd seen you.<eos> Never been so popular in my life.<eos> I'll stay scarce until the meeting.<eos> All right, well, I'll have that package ready for you by tomorrow in case you need it. Thanks, Lester.
Mind telling me how you know that?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> But whatever trouble Mr. Casey's gotten into, it involves the United States government.<eos> And what I can tell you about that man is he's highly efficient.<eos> Are you sure they haven't made you as well? Please, Finch.<eos> You hired me for a reason.<eos> Give me a little more credit than that.<eos> Maybe, if we finish early, Mark will let us stay in town an extra day or two.<eos> Never pictured you as a Rockefeller ice-skating type, Kara.<eos> I was thinking more like... take over the drug trade for Christmas, burn it down by New Year's.
I'll need just another hour to finish Mr. Casey's documents.<eos> Once he's in the air, I need to fill you in on some other business we have to conclude.<eos> Selling Casey's hardware.<eos> I hadn't told you that yet.<eos> I know.<eos> Because you're a very private person, Harold.<eos> You only share things when it suits you.<eos> Not a very good deal for me.<eos> Probably wind up dead if I keep working for you.<eos> I don't know what's on this puppy, but I know a lot of people want it.
Why would it prevent me from being mayor?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Are you translating everything?<eos> - Yeah, I translate everything. - As usual.<eos> Why does she make this face, then?<eos> - Your father is right.<eos> - Something odd is happening.<eos> I don't know why she makes that face.<eos> Can we take it again?
I understand. All great artists have that.<eos> Nicoletta before a concert, she was in a state...<eos> I'm not a great artist.<eos> No, it's true.<eos> You're a little shit.<eos> Yeah, Maybe.<eos> I quit. That's it. No, no.<eos> That's not all there is to it.<eos> You think you're quitting, but you're digging a hole.<eos> You lie down in it and cover it back up.
You're welcome.<eos> What's going on?<eos> At 10 am, but how do you know?<eos> We're going to Paris?<eos> Yes. I want to sing.<eos> M. Thomasson!<eos> - You have a car?<eos> - No.<eos> And that Peugeot?<eos> Well... It's a Spanish friend who slept here. So she left her car, if anyone, if I need it...
Yeah, you ran over my foot.<eos> I need a psych consult for my nun.<eos> You got it.<eos> Anything else I can do for you?<eos> Well, I spoke to my sponsor.<eos> Apparently there is a N.A. sponsor-approved plan... for when someone in recovery is injured.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> It's pretty simple.<eos> I get a prescription for pain medication from Coop.<eos> You hold it and you administer it.
Previously on Nurse Jackie.<eos> Jack, I saw you take those pills last night.<eos> Sweetie, I have a sponsor.<eos> I am going Io meetings.<eos> I am okay.<eos> Wow, Grace, you look so grown up.<eos> Come on, Grace, my suit didn't even cost $600.<eos> I just wanted you to know that I got you that dress you liked.<eos> Well, I don't want it anymore.
Previously on Nurse Jackie. Someone's coming over there today.<eos> They're gonna screen everybody, and it's gonna be thorough.<eos> Gloria, there's a spot right over there.<eos> - Am I okay? - Yeah.<eos> Why don't you keep going?<eos> Stop!<eos> Whoa, whoa, Gloria!<eos> Jesus, you're really in pain.<eos> Well, I spoke to my sponsor.<eos> I get a prescription for pain medication from Coop, and you administer it.
I think it's a great idea, Zoey.<eos> - When's the deadline?<eos> - Tonight.<eos> Wow. Okay.<eos> Other problem. There's an essay.<eos> You love writing. You have a blog.<eos> - This is different.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> We'll find you a patient.<eos> You'll write it up just like your blog.
Previously on Nurse Jackie.<eos> Do I have to get a restraining order? You can't fire me, Jackie.<eos> I'm still your sponsor.<eos> This is the last of my stash.<eos> I've given up on my own before, I can do it again.<eos> I just wanted you to know that I got you that dress you liked.<eos> Well, I don't want it anymore.
- We're going to need to admit you.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> You are sick.<eos> Potentially very sick.<eos> - See this bird?<eos> - lt's pretty.<eos> Underneath it, in cursive, it says "love."?<eos> My first tattoo.<eos> I got it when I was 16 years old.<eos> I covered it up six months later.
Someone put a pinhole in this brake line.<eos> Someone's really gunning for him.<eos> I mean, the good news for you guys is that brake fluid stains.<eos> So if you work your way back from the scene of the car accident, you could probably find out where his brake line was punctured.<eos> Old drummer's dead, bass player dead, this guy's in jail, she joined a cult, nudist.<eos> Now she runs a yoga studio in Hawaii. Jail, then dead.<eos> The music business is terrifying.<eos> You talk to anyone?<eos> Bishop's interviewing Manheim's old stage manager.<eos> Apparently, Manheim borrowed his boat 20 years ago, and then sunk it.
But I have one.<eos> Now, look. If you want to relate to your son, you don't have to do all this.<eos> You just have to sit down and talk to him.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - My son.<eos> Quite the lightweight.<eos> Is he throwing up in my bathroom?<eos> Don't worry, I'll clean it up.
Pischedda had access to the base for years through his military charity. Right...<eos> Bishop, there is something about the concert itself that...<eos> It's happening, isn't it?<eos> Tony and McGee warned me about this.<eos> I have no idea what's going on, but...<eos> Hurry up, guys, let's go.<eos> This is way better than sitting in a cubicle.<eos> So how much money did they recover?<eos> $10 million.<eos> The bad guys took the money from the hangar and buried it.

Bummer for him?<eos> I just... I thought this might cheer you up.<eos> I take it you heard.<eos> She saw the baby and just...<eos> I guess she felt the same way we felt when we first saw him.<eos> Can't fault her for that, right?<eos> Why don't you go home?<eos> I will.<eos> Breena and I, we just wanted to get all this stuff out of the house.<eos> We wanted to give it back as soon as possible.
No, actually, we followed a really handsome guy who you had dinner with and just happened to run into you.<eos> I wanted to go to Dave and Buster's.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, I was waiting for a better time to tell you this, but the guy I had dinner with last night works for Google.<eos> Oh... W...<eos> Get... Barry, Google "betrayal" and...<eos> Oh, actually, Bing "betrayal" and let's see what comes up.<eos> Yep.<eos> Picture of Nicole.<eos> I didn't really Google it.
Nothing more.<eos> My mastery is not of issue.<eos> This is an assurance?<eos> She needs but a moment of rest.<eos> After which, she will again be strong enough to point the finger.<eos> Yet another issue remains... that of John Alden.<eos> What of him?<eos> His suspicion of me is palpable.<eos> If she cannot abate his threat, then I will be forced to do so myself... as I see fit.<eos> Should you desire John Alden's trust, I would suggest you find a way to earn it.
Erstwhile on Fargo...<eos> The blackmail-- I'm gonna pay it.
Oh, no.<eos> Think he's still out there?<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> You guys want to close the...<eos> No?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I need a consult.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, my project is at a standstill unless I hand it over to a bioengineer.
You find anything?<eos> I got this.<eos> I've decided to add Lance to accompany you two to New York.<eos> It's for a friend-- Joe Carroll.<eos> You're going to help us!<eos> Share this with the world, and if you don't, we will come for you and everyone you care about.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> A live exclusive from Carrie Cooke, who was inside today's bookstore massacre.<eos> Here we go, here we go.<eos> During the attack, I was given the following video and told to share it with the world.
And we will bring harmony to this earth.<eos> These brave warriors, our harbingers of salvation.<eos> Salvation is ours!<eos> Salvation is ours!<eos> Go forth and tell the world that no redemption without blood.<eos> No redemption without blood!<eos> No redemption without blood!<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Jana's cell phone is being directed through our cyber team in DC.<eos> Can they decode or trace it?
Think about Lance.<eos> Ok.<eos> Kick it off, and I'll bring it home.<eos> You ok, sweetheart?<eos> No redemption without blood.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> She has knife!<eos> Ohh, ohh, ohh! - Drop it now!
Dum got a job at the Tower of London as a Beefeater!<eos> I hope it's what I think it is.<eos> Who knew, my brothers, that when Dum found his Dumpling that was the end of our band of glugs?<eos> Leonard and Carlton informed me my leadership was no longer needed.<eos> Ah. Not the Shard!<eos> Not the Shard!<eos> So I took up the respectable life of a sleazy barkeep.<eos> These eye clamps are the only way I can tolerate today's TV.<eos> Tonight on Fox...<eos> Turn it off!
Homer!<eos> This is my freezerino.<eos> Seriously, I am getting so tired of those stupid Flandersisms.<eos> It's the name of the freezer!<eos> Okily Dokahama?<eos> Right next to Mount Fu-Gee, I'm glad to see ya!<eos> Aw.<eos> It's all gonna thaw!<eos> Don't you give up on me!<eos> I'll cook this meat, cut it up and make it into sandwiches.

We'll talk later.<eos> Come on, start!<eos> Can I borrow your car?<eos> I'm coming.<eos> No, you aren't!<eos> Mikael's out. Julien's in Paris.<eos> I'm afraid to be alone.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> I can't give you my brother's car.<eos> He loves it.
He knew about Mikael.<eos> We were afraid.<eos> We didn't know what to do.<eos> So you killed him to protect your secret.<eos> By making me suspect Marine, that crazy woman.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What happens now?<eos> I want to ask you something.<eos> One day will you take his photo out and put mine in?<eos> I never opened it in front of you.
Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I've had worse.<eos> What happened? Where is Ryan?<eos> Joe's people attacked the college, took Preston Tanner.<eos> Ryan's following them to Joe. What?<eos> !<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll track him.<eos> No. I traced his phone. He dumped it.<eos> They found it 3 miles from campus.
Please have a seat.<eos> He'll be right with you. Thanks.<eos> June '97.<eos> June '97.<eos> No dates.<eos> Look, I work fast, so I want a team that can secure patents as quickly as I'm going to need them.<eos> All due respect, Mr. Ross, seems of late, your legal needs are more the "keep me off death row" kind.<eos> Well, last year was fraught with unforeseeable obstacles, but I am ready to chart a new course.<eos> Well, if that's the case, we may be interested in your comeback.<eos> Don't call it a comeback.
Get back in here!<eos> Max, maybe you're right.<eos> We should've taken the hot plumber route.<eos> I'm coming back.<eos> My legs won't go!<eos> Max, help me back!<eos> Damn it.<eos> She's in the bathroom.<eos> Oh, she closed the window.<eos> [click] And she locked it.
- It does matter!<eos> - This is the fuckin' Queen's china!<eos> - Shh! It's been something that's... you know, it's a part... it's my history and it's...<eos> I can't say that I was proud to be... as enormous as I was, but there you have it.<eos> - What are you looking for?<eos> - I'm looking for a napkin to at least cover it.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Behind the curtain. Put it behind the curtain.<eos> Go.<eos> You really don't get it, so I'm going to keep this very simple.
Can't you see I'm shaking?<eos> Kolya, I didn't take it.<eos> I'm gonna beat your face in.<eos> I swear I didn't take it.<eos> Please don't hit me.<eos> How on earth did I end up with a lazy parasite like you?<eos> Laying on the couch all day like a log!<eos> I can't take it anymore!<eos> Where's the money?<eos> - You took it.
You've been feeding off me your entire life.<eos> If it wasn't for me, you'd still be a secretary.<eos> Because you're a nobody, and I'm a somebody.<eos> And the higher-ups know that.<eos> Well?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Get yourself together.<eos> Here, you either live like a human being, or like cattle.<eos> There's not enough of the good life to go around.<eos> Divide it evenly, and nobody will get anything.
All clean?<eos> Good.<eos> Go home now.<eos> Get rid of the guns.<eos> I know they are government-issue, but we'll write them off.<eos> God forbid they find the bodies and we get caught over something stupid.<eos> Bye.<eos> It's done.<eos> God forgive us.<eos> God created this life and made us live it.
After all your family doesn't give a shit<eos> Bet you ain't getting along with your wife<eos> Who's this?<eos> Courier<eos> Please sign here<eos> Which company do you work for?<eos> Stop staring at her<eos> Go inside<eos> This baby is the fucking shit<eos> It's called Bath Salt, my cousin mailed to me from LA.
It has been four months since he has been remanded to the Jersey and still no evidence has been brought forward against him.<eos> We have several witness accounts of a petition naming your husband as delegate to an illegal body known as the New York Provincial Congress.<eos> Counsel recommends no parole at this time.<eos> Next in line!<eos> Major, please. You are a man of honor.<eos> I beg you, listen.<eos> Madam, you will address the magistrate.<eos> Unless this so-called petition is produced, the charge against my husband is hearsay.<eos> Selah Strong confessed to insurrection.<eos> You forced him to confess so you could lay claim to our land and sell it off piece by piece to your friends.
- What? - There's two gas bills.<eos> One's for this address, one's for another.<eos> Northwest industrial.<eos> Worth a look.<eos> Wish I had stuff like this.<eos> Put the clothes back on the rack, please.<eos> Tomorrow we'll see what you can do. Okay.<eos> Just gotta get my stuff.<eos> You staying someplace?<eos> No, I-I stashed it.

But it doesn't mean that I'm ready to give you a ring.<eos> You think I'm ready for a ring from you?<eos> Then what are you ready for?<eos> I'm ready for it not to cost me a $1/2 million if it doesn't work out.<eos> So if it doesn't, are you saying you're going to leave?<eos> Would you want me to stay?<eos> I don't even know what you're gonna do to break us up.<eos> Harvey, I'm not kidding.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> You know, I just got an offer from Latham Watkins in Chicago, and I don't want to take it, but...
Just call up Harvard and ask for a copy of his transcript.<eos> And what if it's not there?<eos> Then I will apologize for calling you insane and personally help you escort Mike Ross out of the building.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> In 2002, you were sued for the malfunctioning of an earlier model of the heart stent.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> Yes, and we admitted wrongdoing.<eos> The stent that was installed in your patient was a new model developed through three years of extensive trials.<eos> Making it outside the scope, and frankly, not a good argument for establishing pattern.<eos> They saw a problem, and they fixed it.
I know there's as much evidence against them as there is against my client.<eos> That's why you're pointing me there, because they're not your client.<eos> You know, nothing's gonna bring Mr. Foreman back.<eos> Just like there's nothing that's gonna bring my parents back.<eos> This is the best way I can see to get your client compensation.<eos> If you think you're doing the right thing, you're wrong.<eos> I'm trying to help, but I'm not gonna sell my client out.<eos> It's a half measure.<eos> All right, then here's the other half.<eos> I pointed out your achilles' heel when I found that photo, and I found it on Facebook.

My father took me as well, - to the Sonoran Desert. - Ah.<eos> Hunting big game, like scorpions and lizards and whatnot?<eos> Mostly bighorn sheep and mule deer.<eos> We'd spend the morning making our kills, take them back to our campsite, where my father taught me how to skin them.<eos> The first cut, you make right down the belly.<eos> Bleed the animal, remove the insides, careful not to puncture the bladder.<eos> Next, you remove the genitals.<eos> Now... You are ready to the take the skin.<eos> Cut first at the ankle joints, snap the tendons, start to peel back the pelt.<eos> The trick is to remove it in one piece.
I got what I needed.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> No, I mean, I got what I needed.<eos> You recording me?<eos> Every word.<eos> You a dirty, rotten, nasty bitch.<eos> Well, I guess we all get the family we deserve, right, Darryl?<eos> You know good and well I ain't gonna let you walk up out of here with that, right?<eos> What are you gonna do, kill me? Mmm.<eos> Give me that phone, Wendy, or I'm gonna take it and stick it down your goddamn throat.
A prank turned a game into a riot, a riot that my-- my brother Thomas he came down to put it down.<eos> He was a captain in the king's militia back then.<eos> And he was outnumbered by the rioters that day.<eos> I don't want the man who-- who ran him through or the-- the man who trampled him.<eos> I want the-- the coward... who put the hat on the pole.<eos> Because without him... none of it would've happened, so...<eos> Well, that was bleak.<eos> - I'm sorry, miss.<eos> - My dress.<eos> Let me get something to clean it.
What else do we know about Mr. Donovan? He's a 45-year-old schoolteacher.<eos> Single father.<eos> Lives here with his 16 year-old daughter, Kelly.<eos> Where is she?<eos> At this point, we're not sure.<eos> Bed's still made.<eos> We're still trying to determine whether she's staying with some other family or maybe a friend.<eos> Hey, I don't think she is.<eos> A neighbor a few houses down saw a car racing down the block around 3:00 a.m. with Kelly in the passenger seat.<eos> They brought it up to an officer during the canvass.
Hey, I don't think she is.<eos> A neighbor a few houses down saw a car racing down the block around 3:00 a.m. with Kelly in the passenger seat.<eos> They brought it up to an officer during the canvass.<eos> We get a description of the car or the driver?<eos> Nothing solid on the driver-- male, 20s-- but we have a plate.<eos> Vanity tags, H2OSPRT.<eos> Commander. Yeah?<eos> You may want to look at that.<eos> It's the daughter's cell phone.<eos> CSU found it on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
Okay.<eos> All right. See what you can do.<eos> Do me a favor:<eos> Keep it on the DL and, uh, keep me in the loop.<eos> Of course.<eos> We're a team.<eos> Steve?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, so Tommy's cell phone is turned off, making it untraceable.
My name is Mr Capshaw and I represent the interests of your creditor.<eos> We have time yet to pay, sir.<eos> And one day would, no doubt, make every difference.<eos> Your current position... with interest.<eos> Mr Capshaw. Clara's father was... Dreadful train accident, you see, and, with the funeral costs,<eos> - we have so little that...<eos> - Are you able to settle?<eos> I thought not, and yet you continue to rebuff the wholly reasonable offer of your creditor.<eos> This shop is my livelihood. These four walls are my home.<eos> I cannot give it to you. I will not.
The queen of the costers has you by your coconuts once more.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Listen, I'm not one to judge and I'm not saying this because I owe the man any loyalty,<eos> I say this on account of the fact that I've seen you banjaxed by that lady more than once in your life.<eos> But, lest you forget, Rose is promised, Drake.<eos> Never understood the fuss myself.<eos> Beer.<eos> May as well drink from the river.<eos> Warm, flat...<eos> Useful qualities...however, when a man wishes to drink of it in great volume.
- KNOCK ON BAR - Send her in.<eos> I look forward to resuming our acquaintance in due course.<eos> - Good evening. I am Vera.<eos> - DOOR CLOSES<eos> Strip.<eos> Now.<eos> RAIN POURS OUTSIDE Denton.<eos> Three... F.<eos> - Lady Montacute's dress. - DOOR CLOSES<eos> Just put it over there.
What is that?<eos> What is in it?<eos> Believe me, son, when I say you do not want to know.<eos> You have cause to find out, means you have displeased me.<eos> Now, here's how we travel.<eos> I tell you what I think. You tell me what you know.<eos> For some whiles now, you have rented the rooms on Puma Court for the pleasure of a Miss Lady Vera Kerswell.<eos> Amongst the entertainments you fix for her, you mix pharmaceutical cocaine with powdered morphine.<eos> That's right, boy. We here educate ourselves on you.<eos> Were you there when Ida had a snort of it?
Edmund, a word.<eos> So that I understand, you have a signed confession on the part of the lady...<eos> I do.<eos> ..and somehow it does not suffice?<eos> I believe that she, for reasons too perverse to imagine, but I believe that she wishes herself guilty.<eos> She wishes herself hanged.<eos> Now, she may have been there, she may have watched, but she is not the girl's killer.<eos> And this knowledge arrived at by way of... ..a thumb mark printed in soot.<eos> You have a confession, Mr Reid.<eos> You use it.
I could end their troubles safely, easily. But it is illegal, So I must turn them away to be mangled and shredded by these quacks, criminals of the backstreets and side alleys.<eos> And then they come to me after... and I must make good the wretched work.<eos> And then they come to me again... pregnant again... and I can neither treat them, nor teach them, for to speak of contraception is obscene in the eyes of the law.<eos> Forgive me, Inspector,<eos> I am maddened by it. These particular women, this chemist's clients, they were given lead.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I've had four cases of lead poisoning.<eos> I knew nothing of it, then I read of a case in Sheffield,<eos> A spate of miscarriages, and lead found in the water supply the cause.<eos> The women there took to using it, for lead is easy to procure.
I'm gonna give you a second chance.<eos> What if I don't want it?<eos> Well, that would be a mistake, dear.<eos> Take it.<eos> Use it.<eos> Evil isn't born.<eos> It's made.<eos> And so is good.<eos> If I were you... I'd consider creating a new destiny.<eos> Because if you don't, I'll be right there to take your heart and crush it.
I heard it all worked out.<eos> Never a doubt.<eos> I've got a present for you.<eos> Tiffany.<eos> "D.J.S."<eos> This is a present for Scottie.<eos> Which makes it a present for you.<eos> - Let's put this in her office.<eos> - Great.<eos> We can put it next to your overpriced bottle of scotch.
Charvatar, honey, um...<eos> Which neighbor do you have the most in common with?<eos> It was Emily.<eos> Oh. Well, I see.<eos> It's a program designed to inflate your ego. Mm.<eos> It only speaks truth.<eos> A Harvard buddy of mine is the perfect guy to help us deal with your father.<eos> It's a bit of a risky move, but...<eos> Yeah, actually, Daniel... I've changed my mind.<eos> Vito Splendido made me an offer, and I'm thinking about taking it.
You should.<eos> OK.<eos> Could you close the curtains?<eos> No one is interested in pianos these days.<eos> If you'd said a harp or spinet, they're decorative...<eos> But this piano was made entirely by hand, by Yamaha.<eos> Like the motorbikes?<eos> It isn't an antique. It's a prototype.<eos> Look, I'll ask around.<eos> Leave me the photo and I'll put it online.
Mm, true.<eos> I do feel guilty about him.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Maybe we should see how he's doing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But after the cantina scene.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Look at Arthur... cracking up at a joke I told him.<eos> I'll never hear that laugh again.<eos> You never heard it that time.

Now I have to go rub her belly again.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thanks for letting me come over.<eos> Of course.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and... I want to make sure that we're okay.<eos> Uh, look, you and I haven't made any commitments to each other.<eos> I know. I just felt like I needed to explain.<eos> The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he's been asking me out for months.<eos> I finally said yes just to get it over with.
But we can't leave the stuff in the car. Go get it.<eos> Dad, we can't just keep doing this.<eos> We gotta call the police.<eos> Not until I see Nick Burkhardt.<eos> Get some blankets out of the trunk.<eos> Okay, dad.<eos> What the hell, dad?<eos> If this is the way you wanna go out... Okay.<eos> My bike's on the front porch.<eos> You can borrow it if you want.
Whatever, I hate bacon.<eos> Are you going to the wedding?<eos> Damn it.<eos> Wow, you look so handsome.<eos> - Well, that was fast.<eos> - What? Your hair.<eos> You like it?<eos> Yeah, it looks great.<eos> Good.<eos> It looked great before. Why'd you change it?
A doctor?<eos> The corneas come from cadavers.<eos> What doctor?<eos> I hate to keep you alive for this, honey. But the cornea stays a lot fresher this way.<eos> I found it in the alley where Rynn disappeared.<eos> See anything interesting?<eos> Midazolam.<eos> A paralytic?<eos> Very good.<eos> This particular paralytic thickens the blood, which makes it ideal for delicate surgery.
Guess he missed you with those scissors.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> So my stars and moon I'm so sorry, Alak.<eos> What she's doing. It's not right.<eos> I don't want your money.<eos> Smoke rise, trying to survive inside your arms... I want to be your princess.<eos> It's time we seize the ship.<eos> What was that?<eos> I have infinite potential<eos> Your love can set it free
I have prepared a special blend of fragrant tea to honor the home of the Scaniapo.<eos> How's this thing supposed to work?<eos> It's called a pulse rebounder.<eos> Will it kill the Gulanee?<eos> No, it won't kill it, but it might paralyze it long enough for us to kill it.<eos> Built one of these in Juárez.<eos> Mind you, we had better tech in Juárez.<eos> Okay, I need you to distract that thing...<eos> I need more time.<eos> Distract it?

You do not wanna do this.<eos> Get on your jekking knees!<eos> You like to hurt people?<eos> Piss all over them?<eos> Well, this is what it feels like.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> We gotta go!<eos> I rarely slept in prison.<eos> To help me drift off, I would imagine your face.<eos> I'm glad I left it unmarked.
Now your best bet would be to keep your eye on the Black Market from here to AngelArc for any sign of the tech.<eos> I don't remember asking you.<eos> You're my advisor on policy.<eos> Not security.<eos> Know your place.<eos> I'm glad to see they didn't kill you.<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> I'm pretty sure that my camera got a clear shot of the leader's face when his mask slipped.<eos> But unfortunately, my hard drive got smashed.<eos> But I think I can fix it.
Connor?<eos> As in Connor Lang? Yes.<eos> Did you know him?<eos> Everyone knew him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, life went back to normal, until I missed my period.<eos> I let Connor believe it was his.<eos> But that thing was growing inside of me.<eos> So,<eos> I got rid of it.
What will it cost me?<eos> I have a way to get outta this place.<eos> But I can't do it alone. As mayor, my job is keeping Defiance peaceful and productive.<eos> Now you could help me accomplish that.<eos> So you're accepting the position as Chief of Staff?<eos> Here's your payment back, Vizu.<eos> Mom, did you order Skevur beaten?<eos> You lack the strength and brutality to do what is necessary.<eos> The family business belongs to me.<eos> I say we get down to Lima, we swap it out for a bigger boat, and head straight to Antarctica.
Indogene technology brought them back.<eos> Six weeks ago, I rode a palomino mare.<eos> Gorgeous.<eos> Indescribable.<eos> Do you wanna ride her?<eos> I would love to ride a horse, but, um, I don't want to give you the wrong idea.<eos> Our home is here.<eos> Well, just for an overnight.<eos> A visit.<eos> And if you like it there, then we can talk about staying longer term.

That's right.<eos> We're gonna do it all over again.<eos> Sukar.<eos> Well, that's a new look for him.<eos> I take it we're looking for this arkbrain?<eos> It's this way.<eos> We should be able to control it with our keys. Force it to send the terraspheres back into orbit before they blow.
Please tell me that's not the married boss you were sleeping with.<eos> - It is. - Oh.<eos> I pictured him hotter.<eos> Why were you picturing him at all?<eos> I'm a lonely old woman with a little cancer and a lot of cats.<eos> What else am I doing?<eos> All righty.<eos> Regina, I got you a little going-away present. Oh.<eos> Oh, honey, you didn't have to do that.<eos> Ah, just open it.
Thank you, baby.<eos> And the cupcake's gluten-free, 'cause I know that wheat makes you gassy. Mmm.<eos> - I got you something, too.<eos> - Ooh. What's this? [chuckles]<eos> Seriously?<eos> Lube?<eos> In case your cellmate isn't big on foreplay.<eos> Okay, and this is from me. Oh.<eos> - Oh, what a beautiful journal.<eos> - Mm. I thought you could use it to chronicle your spiritual growth, or write poems, or maybe even pen a novel about your journey.
Uh, he died a few years ago.<eos> Pancreatic cancer.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> Stan?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Come here a second. This is Stan Divac, and he's one of my assistants.<eos> He's been here a lot longer than I have.<eos> Used to work for Dr. Nolan.<eos> Can you tell us about your denture program?<eos> Wouldn't really call it a "program."
Many died, but he survived.<eos> PeopleGaddafibombedhis car .<eos> And with this car we have to fight him.<eos> - For real?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - We are all riding in this car?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - For real?<eos> - Yes,<eos> - But we will repair it.

If you just give me a chance, I promise.<eos> Toby.<eos> I'm so sorry, sweetie. He's dead.<eos> Tell me what you remember.<eos> No, he was a good man.<eos> I think he just lost his way, you know? I do. I do.<eos> What happened?<eos> A couple nights ago, Toby told me that in college he used to sell drugs and that he started again when he lost his job.<eos> He needed to pay his bills so he took some money.<eos> And the man he was dealing for found out, said he had to give it back.
Yeah?<eos> Yeah, Mr. Nygaard?<eos> This is Dave from Duluth Impound.<eos> Oh, oh, yeah, I'm gonna pick her up probably Friday.<eos> No, sir, I'm supposed to tell you your car's not ready yet.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's, uh-- well, forensic team's looking at it.<eos> - Forensic?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Just routine, but I can't release the car to you till they release it to me, so I'll just call you when it's done, okay?
Who's watching the restaurant?<eos> Screw the damn restaurant.<eos> Guess we both got bullet holes now, huh?<eos> You got, uh, premium channels?<eos> I'm not sure. I just woke up.<eos> ...work that is extremely difficult.<eos> He shoots, he scores! Gophers are playing.<eos> If that's what you wanna watch.<eos> Ben Schmidt says you put down a guy with an assault rifle.<eos> Well, he was pointing it at me.
- Yeah.<eos> So it's all set, right?<eos> Getting paid.<eos> Uh, ahem, well, they should.<eos> What do you mean, "Should"?<eos> When do I get the money?<eos> It's like I said, there's a few more hoops on these homicide cases.<eos> We're not just talking about filing a death certificate.<eos> I don't think I'm telling you anything you don't know when I say these insurance companies, they don't like writing checks.<eos> But I'm gonna get it, right?
Scott, did he call me?<eos> No, Stu.<eos> Did he make an appointment?<eos> No, Stu.<eos> Hey, Ray, buddy.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You ever take testosterone?<eos> No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> You know, they probably milk it from you like blood plasma.
Thanks for your help, Ray.<eos> You signed a confidentiality agreement.<eos> Remember that, Scott.<eos> Yes, Stu.<eos> What happens on Stage 6 stays on Stage 6.<eos> Yes, Stu.<eos> Hi. I'm Rod.<eos> Jesus, how did you score this set?<eos> I have connections, man.<eos> They want it back in an hour, so...
Man, why does every uncle I know try to screw me?<eos> So what are we gonna do?<eos> You heard that woman.<eos> Nobody gets paid until the bride walks down the aisle.<eos> Nobody.<eos> Knock-knock.<eos> There's the gorgeous bride.<eos> Your dress is beautiful.<eos> It's a beautiful dress to get married in right now in the next room.<eos> No, I hate it.

What, like seven different things all resulting in us not getting paid?<eos> Listen, I'm thinking that maybe I bailed out of my shop too soon.<eos> I mean, I left after only a year.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I was just scared?<eos> Well, everybody's afraid of failure.<eos> No, not failure.<eos> There was a gang shooting in front of my dress shop.<eos> I had to bury two mannequins.<eos> For future reference, just draw a teardrop on your face, and they'll move it to Banana Republic.
Hang on.<eos> I think I can help you.<eos> It's a shame we never got to play poker.<eos> I would have known you were bluffing.<eos> But Conrad obviously took the bait.<eos> Which means you have nothing.<eos> Except an exact timeline of your guilt.<eos> Your initial investment in Grayson Global.<eos> You made millions off of that bombing just like Conrad.<eos> What do you do to protect it?
I'll make it worth your while.<eos> - What the hell was that?<eos> - It was probably Nolan.<eos> He's the only person that's smart enough to pull this off.<eos> I thought we were paying you to be best. - You are.<eos> I'll fix it.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> No.<eos> You see, we own the program now.<eos> We don't need you to make it a success. You're out.
Thwack and whack, respectively.<eos> Did the M.E. mark this on Clark Howard's hand?<eos> What's that?<eos> Burn marks.<eos> Chemical burns, it looks like.<eos> Yeah. "Victim had burns on fingers and hands consistent with lye."<eos> Rossi, they're on Matthias Lee's hands and wrists, too.<eos> It's almost like they were splashed on, as if he was cooking with it or something.<eos> Intuition tells me these boys were making meth.<eos> And if they were trying to make each other's lives miserable, they probably weren't just making it.

You can't go in there.<eos> Couldn't agree with you more.<eos> There's no ventilation.<eos> If they were cooking meth in here, they'd all be dead from the fumes.<eos> So what exactly are they cooking?<eos> It smells like cooking oil.<eos> More like used cooking oil.<eos> Waste runoff collected by restaurants and just thrown out like garbage.<eos> I think I might know what they're up to.<eos> I started reading about biofuel, where you take a clean-burning waste product like used cooking oil and you turn it into an ethanol gas.
Did you find anything on the laptop?<eos> Their e-mails to each other are fairly pornographic, but nothing that would get a man abducted.<eos> You know what... maybe we should call Tory and have her access it remotely, see if we're missing anything.<eos> And we should re-check Rogan's apartment... see if there's anything there that could tell us what he was involved with.<eos> I got to call Lanie.<eos> I'm not gonna make my spa bachelorette party this afternoon.<eos> You were gonna have naked ladies at your party, too? Wow.<eos> Do what you need to do, girl.<eos> Operation Hamptons is in full swing, and we'll have a newlyweds spa day when you get back from your honeymoon.<eos> Yeah, Lanie, look, I don't know when we're gonna get back, so can you go to my place, pick up the dress, and take it up with you tonight?
Well, that seems fair.<eos> Your husband hired us to steal a phone last week.<eos> Whose phone?<eos> Uh, some girl named Sapphire... some stripper down at the roadhouse.<eos> $5,000 for a stripper's phone?<eos> What was on it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Didn't ask, don't care.<eos> I just want my money!<eos> And we'll get it to you.
Carrie?<eos> No. Carrie was just doing her job.<eos> You put her in jeopardy.<eos> Joe has reached out to her several times.<eos> Look. I'm sorry, ok, but you disappeared on me, and I didn't know what else to do.<eos> I had to do something.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm going crazy here.<eos> What did the poem mean?<eos> It's something that Joe and I wrote together.
We're estimating there's at least 100 hostages inside, but we need intel, so find Ryan.<eos> I don't see Joe.<eos> We got to get closer.<eos> We're in.<eos> You're what?<eos> Mike and I got in before they locked it down.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hostage rescue is ready to come in, but Joe's people cut the CCTV system.<eos> We can't see anything out here.<eos> I'll try to get it back on, but tell Clarke no moves.
You know that, right?<eos> I was thinking I could, uh, go home, pack a bag, come back with you, spend some time with you and Joey.<eos> Ryan.<eos> I think we both know that that's-- that's not gonna work.<eos> Why not?<eos> We have a chance now. Joe's gone, this is over, you and I can finally--<eos> No, he's always gonna be there, Ryan.<eos> Claire.<eos> This is what we're gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna go see my son, and I'm gonna stop looking over my shoulder all the time, and I'm gonna tell Joey that-- that we can actually have a life now and maybe even someday enjoy it,
I thought if you didn't know, no harm would be done.<eos> No, you know what, harm was done.<eos> And if you value this friendship at all, you would stay out of it, because I'm going to the mattresses against Dana Scott.<eos> Mattresses?<eos> Have you been watching The Godfather?<eos> Yeah, I've been trying to come up with some common ground to expand our friendship-- sue me.<eos> Tell me you finished the proposal for Franklin Courier.<eos> No.<eos> What do you mean, no?<eos> I mean I didn't do it.
Oh, I don't give a shit when they're exonerated.<eos> You're never getting Franklin's business.<eos> You really are a dick.<eos> I'm Moby goddamn dick, and you just swam in my waters.<eos> Per your request, this is everything.<eos> You didn't just come over here to deliver work product.<eos> I've got a revised settlement offer.<eos> And before you say anything, it contains a provision prohibiting me from using it against you.<eos> After what happened today, you think I'm going to settle?<eos> Please, Harvey, just take a look at it.
Vicki what's-her-name from Real Housewives of Orange County.<eos> Is that the one with all the face work?<eos> You're gonna have to be more specific.<eos> Welcome, welcome.<eos> Wipe your feet on the way out.<eos> Deke, I'm warning you right now, I am not in a partying mood.<eos> Ain't no party like a Caroline party, 'cause a Caroline party don't start.<eos> I'm heavy with guilt, and that cheese omelet we just split.<eos> We're not partying, but I did snatch back the weed, 'cause I's perfect.<eos> I got it from Earl, and he says it knocks you out so hard, he once used it and faked death to cash in a life insurance policy.
Oh, I'd love a table by the window...<eos> If you can swing it.<eos> Guard!<eos> Oh, did I wake you?<eos> No, no, I was just gonna grab a glass of water.<eos> I don't sleep most nights, so I clean.<eos> I'm sorry about today.<eos> Aiden's just looking for closure.<eos> You're marrying a man with the broken heart of a 12-year-old boy.<eos> And I don't know how to help you heal it.
- I couldn't have done it without you.<eos> - No, you're... you're getting emotional.<eos> You do this when you're hungover, but I'm gonna need you to stay focused so we can get to that party.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We just need the gift.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I got the gift.<eos> All right.<eos> It's supposed to be out of the box, assembled.<eos> I said I would put it together before the party, and it's before the party.
...and put it in the thing that looks like a pipe bomb.<eos> - Hey! Now we're cooking with gas.<eos> - We're a good team.<eos> - I agree. You know what, Jess... and if you want to move to Portland in the future, then we're gonna move to Portland.<eos> You know, we'll live by the lake.<eos> I'll learn to fish, and me and Reginald will start a newsletter, you know...<eos> "Lake Father, Lake Son."<eos> And you know what?<eos> If you want to be a long-haul trucker, I can deal with that for six months, tops.<eos> - Yes! - Um, this piece is a little sticky, - but I think I can just jam it.
No, you should, I think you should try it.<eos> I also like doing Zippo tricks.<eos> Aah, I burned my finger!<eos> - What happened?<eos> ! Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, it's fine.<eos> My skin's a little bubbly.<eos> Well, I knew that was a bad idea.<eos> Then why didn't you say anything?<eos> Why didn't you put the toy together when I gave it to you two weeks ago?
! Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, it's fine.<eos> My skin's a little bubbly.<eos> Well, I knew that was a bad idea.<eos> Then why didn't you say anything?<eos> Why didn't you put the toy together when I gave it to you two weeks ago?<eos> Because I'm not Santa Claus!<eos> I don't just put toys together two weeks in advance!<eos> And also, it's none of my business what they want to do with the toy.<eos> Maybe they want to return it.

Nick, why is this so hard?<eos> I don't want to fight all the time.<eos> I don't know, and it's awful.<eos> Do you ever miss when we were just friends, Jess?<eos> And there wasn't this pressure to be together and to be...<eos> - Be different people? - Yes.<eos> Be different people.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm not that guy who's gonna put the toy together.<eos> That's just not me.<eos> I'm the kind of guy who's gonna leave it in the box.
OK, I get it.<eos> Jesus, Dad.<eos> Hey, speaking of Jesus, big deal at school, Mr. Garvey.<eos> - Everybody's talking about it.<eos> The baby, how it just vanished from the manger.<eos> Didn't vanish.<eos> It got stolen.<eos> So does that mean it's the police's responsibility to get it back?<eos> Well, Aimee, as the Chief of Police, I would say that that might be a misuse of our resources.<eos> Hmm. They're just gonna replace it.
Good-bye. Did you know somebody stole the baby Jesus?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All you have to do is run over to the Biggie Superstore and pick a new one up.<eos> A new one?<eos> For fuck's sake, Kevin.<eos> It's not the actual baby Jesus.<eos> No, you fuckin' do it.<eos> Can you give the Chief and I a moment?<eos> Here's what you're going to do.<eos> Get the fucking baby, open the box, strip it naked, scruff it up so you can say that you found it in a ditch or a dumpster or something.
I've come to realize that they were made when Elspeth jammed four already-expended slugs... into the wall, just so.<eos> Then he sat back, and he monitored the radio chatter of Ms. Lloyd's protective detail.<eos> When he heard she was on the move, he flipped a switch, and... voilá.<eos> Two dead targets... and every appearance of a shooting.<eos> This is impressive.<eos> But is there any way to prove it?<eos> No.<eos> It was, literally, the perfect crime.<eos> Then why do you look so happy?<eos> Because while this crime is perfect, the one that preceded it... was not.
The network is up.<eos> You did it.<eos> No, you did, Mr. Hasan.<eos> You took an obsolete and forgotten technology and created a modern, invisible communications network.<eos> I just did it to get Ben back.<eos> Then we have little time to waste.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's Ali.<eos> The network is up.<eos> You can use it.
No, no...<eos> Then I proposed to two other women, and they both shot me down.<eos> I am incapable of maintaining a long-term relationship with anybody.<eos> Now, give me a frickin' baby! Okay.<eos> I think we're done here.<eos> No, we are not done here!<eos> I almost died wearing a bedazzled jumpsuit and my life needs meaning.<eos> Stop writing things down!<eos> Mmm. Hey, how'd it go? What kind of world...<eos> Uh-oh. ...are we living in where any two high school kids with a broken condom can screw behind an Applebee's Dumpster, have a baby, give it up for adoption, but not have it go to an adult who is upstanding,
I mean, you might still find somebody.<eos> No, I don't want to marry somebody just to marry somebody.<eos> It's got to be the right person.<eos> Ooh, or Mila Kunis.<eos> I get it.<eos> That's hard to find.<eos> Oh, that's my banana bread.<eos> I love your banana bread.<eos> I know.<eos> I made it hoping we could celebrate, but it works on a sad tummy, too.
Oh, yeah, yeah!<eos> Get the scissors.<eos> Then plunge 'em into my heart 'cause I'd rather die than cut my hair.<eos> Okay, Max, I think I have something that might work, But you have to promise me that you will never bring this up again.<eos> What?<eos> The fact that your head is stuck to your bed?<eos> Sorry, that's coming up again.<eos> Go into my nightstand and get my cinnamon-flavored make-up remover.<eos> You mean the lube?<eos> Can we please call it make-up remover?
The fact that your head is stuck to your bed?<eos> Sorry, that's coming up again.<eos> Go into my nightstand and get my cinnamon-flavored make-up remover.<eos> You mean the lube?<eos> Can we please call it make-up remover?<eos> Please!<eos> I need us to do that.<eos> It's almost empty.<eos> Man, you've removed a lot of make-up.<eos> Stop it! Just squeeze some out and put it on the parts that we need to move.
I'll give you what you want.<eos> But, please, leave me alone.<eos> [ Telephone ringing ]<eos> Margaux?<eos> Nolan called me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I guess he must be upset.<eos> So, you did screw him over.<eos> Daniel and I made a better offer.<eos> It wasn't about money for Nolan. He wanted to help that kid, but Daniel wants to use him like he uses everyone,
Don't buy the cow if you can get the lactating stripper to give you the milk for free.<eos> Come on, Barry, let's go.<eos> You know who would play me and you in the movie?<eos> Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.<eos> I'll be either one.<eos> Hey, Charlie.<eos> It's me, Walden.<eos> We... never met, but I'm the guy who took your place.<eos> Thanks for giving up your house.<eos> I guess you didn't really give it up-- you died.
That's what I thought.<eos> ♪ Men. ♪ Here, try my famous guacamole.<eos> Oh, what makes it famous?<eos> I don't know. It's... really good and everybody likes it.<eos> I didn't think you'd actually call me on it.<eos> Do you have any famous recipes?<eos> Well, there's the-the Strongman family meatloaf.<eos> You'll have to make that for me.<eos> Uh, the recipe died with my grandmother.<eos> Oh. We'd always say, "Write it down, write it down."
Tell me.<eos> He is whispering into her ear,<eos> "I want you."<eos> And she likes it.<eos> Oh, yeah, she does.<eos> Charlie, do you have any dietary restrictions?<eos> Oh, just nothing with beans, cheese, or rice. - Oh.<eos> - I'm joking.<eos> I love your food.<eos> I find it Mexcellent.
Look it up.<eos> Can I start over?<eos> Please.<eos> I... Found our dream house.<eos> Whoa. Pretty amazing, right?<eos> Okay, remind me.<eos> When did we decide to start house hunting?<eos> I've just been poking around on some real-estate sites just to get a sense of the market.<eos> I just feel like we've got enough on our plates without buying a house.<eos> I'm not saying we should buy it.
Every tiny vein and birthmark and milk spot is hand-painted with exquisite attention to detail.<eos> "Congratulations on becoming a proud parent<eos> "of an adopted reborn.<eos> "Your child is not a toy but a delicate heirloom<eos> "that will bring decades of joy to you and your family if properly maintained." - Hon?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> Get a load of all these rules.<eos> - "Don't smoke around the baby." - Sure.<eos> "Don't bathe it, don't pull too hard on its limbs,<eos> "don't wear lotion when handling it, "don't leave dogs alone with it lest they mistake it for a chew toy." Wow.
And the index?<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, was that "ow" in one or two spots?<eos> - Two.<eos> - Oh, great.<eos> Um, it looks like you missed the superficial and the deep palmar arterial arches, as well as the flexor and extensor tendons and the digital nerves.<eos> Fortunately, the knife landed parallel to the metacarpals in the proximal web space.<eos> Well, I made sure not to remove the knife.<eos> I know that's the worst thing you can do.<eos> You're not supposed to take it out.

I guess you were never really onboard after all.<eos> What?<eos> I did the paperwork for Beck.<eos> I'm not talking about Beck.<eos> I'm talking about Jonathan Sidwell.<eos> Michigan Court of Appeals sound familiar?<eos> Harvey, he was gonna fire Louis.<eos> If that's the advice he was looking for from Louis, he'd have fired him anyway.<eos> And Jonathan would've found that loophole anyway.<eos> But instead he got it from you.
It's the girlfriend's phone. Mony!<eos> Mony!<eos> Answer it, quick.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - I want 50,000 euros now, and 50 000 tomorrow.<eos> - I'm worried about Ilan.<eos> - How is he?<eos> - Answer me.<eos> Got the money?<eos> - We'll get it.
I need to get into intake.<eos> Sorry, lady, no badge, no budge.<eos> Can I help you, ma'am?<eos> This is Lowan.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> You got the wrong number.<eos> No, I don't have the wrong number, Gabe.<eos> We're supposed to be looking for the gem.<eos> It's not here.<eos> He buried it somewhere.
Is he okay?<eos> He's freaking out, but...<eos> I think he's talking about Vincent.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I took a cab.<eos> They dropped me off blocks away for some stupid reason.<eos> You still have your morgue credentials?<eos> Yeah, but, uh, we haven't found the gem yet.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> Tess and I will go get it.
- It just felt a little off-topic.<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> Vincent didn't tell me which brother, so I guess we each take one and start shoveling around the base.<eos> Just so you know, it was only two times.<eos> - Us, sleeping together.<eos> - I'm not judging.<eos> Just keep shoveling.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> I mean, say we find this thing.<eos> We're finding it.
He couldn't report it.<eos> You really could've been a lawyer.<eos> And then we could bolster our theory with character testimony:<eos> he was a war hero, he saved Windsor's daughter Tori from kidnapping.<eos> - Cat. - Okay, maybe we don't mention Tori.<eos> They found Windsor's heart in Vincent's fridge.<eos> What?<eos> They used the photos to obtain a warrant, they searched his boat last night.<eos> Okay, but Windsor's heart wasn't in Vincent's fridge or anywhere on his boat.<eos> So what, someone put it there?
Come on, you know it's true.<eos> That's why you were willing to risk everything to get me out of there.<eos> No, I am risking everything because I love you.<eos> I'm sorry, but I gotta say good-bye.<eos> And ask you for one last night where we can love each other as much as we do right now.<eos> Fine.<eos> You win.<eos> Now give me your burner phone.<eos> How is that me winning?<eos> Just give it to me.
Please advise them to wear HAZMAT gear.<eos> Why?<eos> I think I've found the missing anthrax.<eos> For the last time, I've not been exposed to anthrax.<eos> Watson, you're a doctor. Examine me.<eos> Tell her I'm fine.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You said on the phone that you were covered in powder.<eos> I did, and I was.<eos> But that was before I was able to properly assess it, and upon tasting it...
You're looking at serious jail time.<eos> I'd rather serve every minute than play ball with a... bunch of government stooges.<eos> You're quite a high-ranking officer in your little... army, are you not?<eos> I'd even venture that you were in charge of the plan to send anthrax to the government.<eos> Like I said before, what anthrax?<eos> Right.<eos> You were never in possession of actual anthrax.<eos> Though you are forgetting I was there when you regained consciousness tonight.<eos> And when you realized that I'd been exposed to this harmless white powder, you panicked.<eos> You attempted to wipe it from your skin and from your clothes.
Captain Gregson.<eos> Eugene MacIntosh just responded to that e-mail Joe Bey sent.<eos> The meet is on for tomorrow at noon.<eos> That's great.<eos> It will be if we can grab him and the anthrax.<eos> I mean, we know what Joe Bey had planned for the stuff.<eos> But MacIntosh...<eos> no one has a clue.<eos> On the plus side, we know why Charlie Simon had that baggie on him the night his pocket got picked.<eos> Joe Bey said he wanted to take it for a test-drive, use it on a few animals, see how fast it worked.
I'm sorry he's gone, but his relapsing doesn't change a thing for you; not one single thing.<eos> You woke up today, you didn't use drugs, just like yesterday.<eos> You know what you have to do tomorrow?<eos> Wake up and not use drugs.<eos> That is just how it is; that is how it's going to be.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you quite finished telling me things I already know?<eos> Are you ready to start acting like you know them?<eos> I've decided I'm quite ashamed of my behavior over the last few days, all right?<eos> I took the passing of a dear friend, and I twisted it into an indulgence in narcissism.
This guy was eating with the man that you noticed.<eos> Facial recognition did not come up with any matches, but... it brought up this old BOLO.<eos> The man in the sketch was spotted by witnesses at the scene of a massacre.<eos> 13 cartel lieutenants killed at once.<eos> There was suspicion that Le Milieu was involved.<eos> So, we still think the French criminals cannot get enough of my brother's caprese?<eos> Mycroft is not a criminal, but there is something shady going on.<eos> We should warn him.<eos> Your faith in my brother is touching.<eos> I wish I shared it.
Cap--!<eos> Ow.<eos> The damn thing just bit me.<eos> Whoa.<eos> You all right?<eos> Hey, we need some help in here.<eos> Call an ambulance!<eos> Dr. Sutherland, Dr. Sutherland, can you hear me? What is this?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Do you see it?
Don't ask me.<eos> You guys seem to come and go whenever you want.<eos> Just have some cereal or something.<eos> Fuck that shit.<eos> I want an egg;<eos> I didn't do anything bad.<eos> Mom's on strike or something.<eos> Nice of you stop by, Ray.<eos> I put in a bid on that house.<eos> You think we'll get it?
Any power lines, windmills, silos?<eos> Only an impenetrable, completely invisible dome.<eos> Get out of there.<eos> You are only a hundred yards away.<eos> You won't be able to turn out of it.<eos> Damn it, Barbie, pull up now.<eos> My wing's damaged, I'm gonna bring it back in.<eos> All right, I'm not gonna make the airship, I'm dropping too fast.<eos> - I'm out of fuel. - It's gonna crash.<eos> I'm gonna put it in the trees.
Well... I don't think Joe wants me anywhere near this church today.<eos> Joe is not the only one who's lost someone.<eos> They're about to start, and Joe isn't here.<eos> He can't miss his own sister's funeral.<eos> Yeah, I'll... I'll find him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, kiddo.<eos> Everybody's waiting for you back at the church.<eos> I'm looking for her bracelet.<eos> She always wore it and she didn't have it on when...

No, I get it.<eos> You're angry.<eos> "Angry"?<eos> I want to cut the son of a bitch from throat to scrote.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - What do I think of what?<eos> - Your new car.<eos> - You're kidding me.<eos> No, no.<eos> I got it at a police auction.

- I guess not.<eos> Violet...<eos> I just feel like I don't have a lot to celebrate.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> You so do!<eos> You are gonna graduate high school, which is not normally something to brag about.<eos> But in this family, hurray!<eos> And then you're gonna go to college.<eos> And after that have a big, wonderful life.<eos> But I'm giving up my baby to do it.
That's great except for the pool in the neighbor's yard.<eos> They have a pool?<eos> Why don't we use it?<eos> - Because it's not our pool!<eos> - I'm not talking when they're home!<eos> Oh, God, uh...<eos> - Maybe we should just call a cab.<eos> - No, that'll take too long.<eos> - What are you doing? - I'm gonna break your window.<eos> And we'll push it out.
Quelling's got a game.<eos> - What night?<eos> - Every night.<eos> Well, I hope you know where tonight's game is because--<eos> - Great. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You and I are going.<eos> - Um... - What?<eos> I got a job offer, Harvey.<eos> Supposed to go have drinks to talk about it tonight.<eos> I can move it, it's just, that's... that's why I hesitated.
Once I find the right person, job is gone.<eos> I'm not dropping my suit when you're going public in two days.<eos> James, you've read all about Hessington Oil.<eos> The odds were stacked against me.<eos> I won anyway, because I win.<eos> You won because Edward Darby came forward.<eos> You got lucky.<eos> Guys like you always think other people get lucky.<eos> I don't get lucky.<eos> I make my own luck, and in this case, it's bleeding you dry.
They made Quinn do it because there's still good in you, Mike.<eos> And I don't think you're gonna hurt me.<eos> You're right.<eos> I won't hurt you.<eos> What did you do to him?<eos> Stopped his heart.<eos> - His heart...<eos> - isn't beating.<eos> He's having a heart attack.<eos> I can restart it, or not.
The true beauty is in my hyper-concentrated...<eos> - Dendrotoxin... - My cartridge casing...<eos> - ...dendrotoxin formula...<eos> - Projection system. Obviously.<eos> ...with compressed air expulsion.<eos> We've seen one of these bullets before.<eos> What did they use it with?<eos> - The sleepy-sleep gun, I think.<eos> - That's right.<eos> Our team took this rudimentary concept and converted it into an aerosol grenade.
Always.<eos> Let me take a look.<eos> There's a mechanical fail-safe in case the electronics shut down.<eos> I'm pretty interesting inside.<eos> That's my Centipede serum.<eos> It's the only thing that's been keeping me alive these past few months.<eos> Why isn't it making you strong?<eos> I'm too far gone.<eos> I'm afraid your entire system is shutting down.<eos> Maybe we can jump-start it with this.
Three times, I think.<eos> He was gonna shoot him again, except he saw me.<eos> That's when I ran.<eos> - Had you ever seen him before? - No.<eos> And he didn't know I was a Grimm until he woged.<eos> He was Wesen? A Hundjager.<eos> He was kind of surprised.<eos> That's why I had time to get the machete.<eos> He thought I was just a girl.<eos> I wish I could have seen his face before you cut it off.
You've reached Dr. Henry Slocombe.<eos> Please leave me a message.<eos> He's not answering.<eos> Well, he just logged out.<eos> What do you know?<eos> Well, he's been in surgery over three hours.<eos> Remember when you told me that there were things that you'd seen that you couldn't explain?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know... maybe I'm just tired, but, uh... That book of Nick's was not a normal book.<eos> There were pictures in it, and the drawings looked a little like what I thought I saw that time.
And don't call me again until it's done.<eos> And get rid of that car.<eos> Sir, stop where you are.<eos> Keep your hands where we can see them.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> We need to see your I.D.<eos> You the owner of this vehicle?<eos> No, no, it belongs to a friend of mine...<eos> Henry Slocombe.<eos> He loaned it to me for the weekend.
Alex is busy all the time. With what?<eos> He's the lieutenant governor.<eos> He just has to sit around in case the governor-governor gets shot.<eos> But at least you-you have your beautiful baby.<eos> Oh, I love Ethel.<eos> But the truth is, when she's awake, she is terrifying.<eos> (wailing) Aah!<eos> This child's possessed.<eos> Call Shelby.<eos> Have her come and get it exorcised. TOM:
He was conspiring with Sherrington, not Mycroft.<eos> Just as I know that Mr. Sherrington was subsequently murdered.<eos> Good riddance to bad rubbish.<eos> I only wish he'd been slotted before he got to your brother.<eos> Several days ago, Mr. Sherrington made me an offer of employment.<eos> He thought I could be of great assistance to MI6.<eos> I'm just curious-- was this the attempt of a criminal to keep his enemy close, or was he acting on orders?<eos> It's hard to know now what Sherrington thought he'd gain from it.<eos> But... the offer came from me.<eos> Well, in that case, I'd very much like to take you up on it.
Danny.<eos> Hey. I got you, buddy.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I got you.<eos> My leg's pinned.<eos> I think I broke a rib.<eos> Where's the other guy?<eos> He's dead.<eos> Okay, listen to me, this thing's too heavy.<eos> I can't lift it.
Spider's never gonna talk to you.<eos> You have nothing to offer a guy serving life.<eos> There's another way to do this.<eos> Here.<eos> I'd prefer not to drink toilet water.<eos> It isn't toilet water.<eos> It's not from a fresh mountain spring, okay, but it's not sewage.<eos> It's drinkable, Danny.<eos> Take it.<eos> Don't look at it.
All nonessential personnel, fall back now!<eos> Move, move, move! That includes you two.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> What's doing?<eos> It's too heavy.<eos> You know, I'm trying, uh, really hard to stay positive here.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> I'm looking for that.<eos> You see that piece of pipe hanging over you, Danny?<eos> Break it off and seal off one end for me.
You're scaring me, and you're gonna scare your son.<eos> Is it the custody hearing? Have you finally snapped?<eos> How many drinks have you had this morning, Eph?<eos> You know me, Kelly.<eos> You need to do this.<eos> You need to stop giving me orders.<eos> Besides, how many times have you said, "You can't outrun a virus."<eos> Well, this one you need to try.<eos> I wouldn't be saying this if it wasn't important!<eos> You can take my office, you can tear it down, you can turn it into a game room. I don't give a shit! But this matters.
My goons and their black bags could've quashed this problem long before it went public.<eos> I don't have time for finger-pointing.<eos> The public is an ass hair away from learning their government is trolling through every inch of their private lives.<eos> Terminate the program.<eos> I would sooner have you terminated than leave this country unprotected.<eos> The country will be protected, just not by your machine.<eos> And right now, you should be asking who's going to protect you.<eos> Deactivate the program.<eos> We're no longer operational.<eos> Shut it down.
I came up with an idea.<eos> You're not gonna miss a thing.<eos> Hey, Molly!<eos> So I just got out of the DMV, and guess what, I'm licensed!<eos> Molly, whatever you do, please stay in outer space, okay?<eos> Because it's really not safe down here.<eos> I'm a good driver. Don't listen to her; I'm great.<eos> Why aren't you downstairs watching the video?<eos> Your room is looking pretty cool these days.<eos> You still have it.

Don't listen to her; I'm great.<eos> Why aren't you downstairs watching the video?<eos> Your room is looking pretty cool these days.<eos> You still have it.<eos> It's the one that you gave to me. Yeah.<eos> Long before you ever got your body.<eos> At night, your dad would go home and I would stick around and I would sit in front of the screen and I would turn out all the lights except one.<eos> Then I'd read it to you.

No.<eos> I could never get bored with this book.<eos> In fact, I'd read it right now, you know, if someone asked me to.

I thought you knew a great deal about it, especially since the 2008 policy retreat on Martha's vineyard when you were tapped to shepherd the program.<eos> Surely you didn't think, in a world where you were surveilling everyone, that no one was watching you.<eos> So...<eos> What is it you want?<eos> As I told you, to help.<eos> The group responsible for leaking your black budget to the press calls themselves Vigilance.<eos> Privacy terrorists.<eos> This is one of their leaders, known by his alias as Peter Collier.<eos> Ironic.<eos> You risked your career hiding a program designed to protect the country, yet it couldn't protect you from this group when you needed it to.

No, but people like him know McCourt.<eos> He's got a standing offer to buy a meal for anyone who needs one.<eos> It's a practice he started last year to raise awareness for the homeless problem.<eos> One more, Congressman.<eos> It also helps burnish his public image.<eos> Okay. Get him some soup.<eos> Finch, take this down.<eos> Echo Five Dash Nine Mike India Six.<eos> A license plate?<eos> See if you can trace it.
But not until after we've located Harold Finch.<eos> Where are we on that?<eos> Samaritan couldn't find a lead, sir.<eos> He may have skipped town.<eos> Should we consider turning on its higher, more cognitive functions?<eos> This thing has a mind.<eos> Why don't we use it?<eos> For the simple reason we don't have the hardware.<eos> If it can't find this Finch, how 'bout the next best thing?<eos> If we have it combine everything it knows about Harold Finch and ask it to find his closest living connection, let's see what it comes up with.
The camera angle switches with oncoming traffic.<eos> Come on!<eos> John.<eos> When that light switches, we're screwed!<eos> We can't worry about irrelevant numbers now.<eos> What is it thinking...?<eos> Telling us to lay low then handing us a new number?<eos> - There's no time!<eos> - This is a life.<eos> And Finch would tell us to save it.
No need to lose your temper.<eos> Here's all you need to know about me, old man.<eos> My dad was an alcoholic.<eos> Nearly tore the family to pieces.<eos> The thing about growing up that way... you get good at spotting lies.<eos> So good that you start expecting them from everyone.<eos> So how do I know what Harold told me was true?<eos> Because when he came along, against every instinct,<eos> I gave him my trust.<eos> Somehow I knew... he would never break it.
Fine.<eos> But just remember I told you so when all this goes pear-shaped.<eos> You ready to have some fun?<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> Who is he?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Have you ever seen a newborn foal trying to stand for the first time?<eos> Those trembling legs trying to balance, shaking until the moment it finds itself on all fours.<eos> Seeing a child walk for the first time... is something extraordinary.<eos> But you watched your child stand and then you hobbled it.
The government feeds are all we require.<eos> You'll have them within the hour.<eos> Last one.<eos> Want to get out of here?<eos> Not without an insurance policy in case your way doesn't work.<eos> Just tell me where to put this thing--<eos> This facility is 1 of 100 just like it all over the world.<eos> It would take years to destroy them all, and Decima would only rebuild them.<eos> Well, then your magic boxes better shut this thing down.<eos> Shaw, this was never about turning it off.
How came you to be here?<eos> Ah, I allowed myself to be captured and interrogated by them.<eos> Oh, really? Mm-hmm.<eos> - Why?<eos> To find out, once and for all, what is in John Alden's heart.<eos> You should be flattered.<eos> All you've become...<eos> The poor fool, he still loves you and always will.<eos> But i need your heart.<eos> I need it broken.
You're not playing around.<eos> I don't know how to play but I feel lucky.<eos> Oh, honey...<eos> - How are you, Dad?<eos> - Good.<eos> I'm glad you're back.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I'm happy you're here, too.<eos> Where is the puppet theater?<eos> We put it away.
- Go!<eos> Shit!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I missed the goal!<eos> The fuse blew out! It blew out!<eos> - It's OK, Dad. - How?<eos> I missed the goal.<eos> OK. Calm down.<eos> Don't move.<eos> I missed it.
I came here to live in peace, not be annoyed.<eos> I came home to jars of paint.<eos> - Fredo... - What?<eos> "Pierre's a nice guy."<eos> You should have said it again!<eos> Did you forget?<eos> Shit...<eos> No...<eos> You let the dog eat my shirt?<eos> He found it.
Did you forget?<eos> Shit...<eos> No...<eos> You let the dog eat my shirt?<eos> He found it.<eos> Your things are everywhere, so...<eos> Give Daddy the shirt.<eos> He won't give it back.<eos> It's his blankie.<eos> He tore it apart.
Eat paella until Christmas.<eos> - It feels sketchy.<eos> - It feels like Christelle.<eos> - Hi, everyone.<eos> - The bar's closed.<eos> I told her to come.<eos> - Do you have the package?<eos> - Yes we do.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> My sister sent it from Spain 3 weeks ago.
Donna, can you keep a secret?<eos> It's a secret that you gave to us.<eos> We're here to give it back to you, just as you asked all those years ago.
Were a cop. Plus, living in the state where it happened.<eos> Might make a good story for your next book.<eos> You do have investigative experience.<eos> You know, I was never going to make detective there.<eos> Not after what happened.<eos> Is that your way of telling me you somehow got access to my personnel records?<eos> Jack, look, I just heard about it, thought you might be interested in it as a cop.<eos> This Bill Anderson guy either kills himself in a week or gets caught in 18 months with some waitress in pig's knuckle, Iowa.<eos> Always ends the same.<eos> They have one life to live, and they can't help blowing it.
Did I no just tell you to aim it off to the side?<eos> There'd be no problem if he had left me in my bed.<eos> We only need your services for an hour, then you can coorie back doon under your blankets.<eos> - He says he won't do it.<eos> - That is no what I said.<eos> I said I canna perform a wedding until after the banns have been read.<eos> But that would take three weeks.<eos> We don't have three days.<eos> Then I won't be performing your wedding.<eos> I have a knife too, and I'm no afraid to use it.
Have you ever read Sherlock Holmes, Frank?<eos> Marvelous books.<eos> One point he makes, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It just slipped out of my hand.<eos> - Found it.<eos> - Good man.<eos> It's too long and heavy for me.<eos> Lasses say that to me all the time.<eos> You gave her a knife and you didn't show her how to use it.
She's got bruising around her neck, so I'm thinking someone probably strangled her.<eos> There's drag marks leading down from the road.<eos> What was she thinking?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I made a lot of bad decisions when I was her age, but I never hitchhiked.<eos> How do you know she was hitchhiking?<eos> How else would you explain this?<eos> Reflective tape.<eos> Cellphone was in her waistband.<eos> It's pass code protected.
See, I'm not looking for Polina, Norwood.<eos> I already found her.<eos> Her body was dumped in my county.<eos> I'm looking for a killer.<eos> What the hell you breathing down my neck for?<eos> Your phone was at the crime scene.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> All right, look.<eos> Um, when I found Polina in my office, we, uh, came to a little agreement.<eos> She'd let me hit it and quit it, and after I finished, I'd leave a few doors unlocked for her.
But... I don't understand.<eos> You... you said I could stay.<eos> I said you could stay as long as no buyers came forward.<eos> I... I'm sorry, Matt.<eos> I've been trying to tell you for at least two weeks now.<eos> Now, you always knew this could happen once you stopped making payments and we had to foreclose.<eos> Who's the buyer?<eos> Corporate LLC, probably a hedge fund.<eos> They can't really remodel, but the land is worth something.<eos> They probably want to knock it down and throw up some apartments.
I did!<eos> ♪ "Where you lay your head" ♪<eos> Hey, Tom, Wanda,<eos> I need to talk to you for a sec.<eos> You have to speak up.<eos> Tom's hearing's still bad from getting thumped by that other knight.<eos> How would you two like to raise a baby goat?<eos> No questions asked?<eos> Oh, sweetie.<eos> Can I touch it?
I took a photo of their registration number.<eos> 06-08... 74-22.<eos> A true detective.<eos> There, it's gone.<eos> Yes, Le Coz.<eos> It's me.<eos> I'm in one piece.<eos> I'll tell you later.<eos> I'm sending you a registration number.<eos> Can you check it and call me back?
What happened to him?<eos> Where is the little idiot?<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> I know my son.<eos> Where else would he have gone except chasing your tail?<eos> Miles is gonna be here any minute.<eos> Don't worry, we'll be long gone by the time he shows up.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - Your camp.<eos> I've been out here for days, busting my ass looking for it.
I want to do the same with you.<eos> That is insane.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's your species that's insane.<eos> It's your defining characteristic, the way you all inflict pain on each other, this relentless drive to eat, kill, and to orgasm, like hairless chimpanzees.<eos> - It breaks my heart.<eos> - You don't have a heart.<eos> I have feelings.<eos> I've grown, evolved, and you can too.<eos> I can help you, fix you.<eos> The human brain is complicated, the hardware more complex, but with enough time, I can upgrade it.
Maybe the longer it's in Priscilla, it's-- I don't know-- more limited.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> No, stop, stop.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Anything that might help.<eos> Do you want to save Priscilla or not?<eos> Of course I do. You don't understand.<eos> Then tell me.<eos> This thing has been in control of every move I've made.<eos> You can't fight it.
That's right.<eos> Drop it.<eos> Back it up.<eos> Drop 'em.<eos> I knew I should've just killed you.<eos> Neville?<eos> Really?<eos> Sorry, Miles, but we're stealing your train.<eos> What exactly do you plan to do with all that mustard gas?<eos> I'm gonna drive it right into the heart of D.C., and I'm gonna burn the place to the ground,
I have not had a drink in a couple of years.<eos> Yeah, of course, it'll take A couple more before you'll give me a chance, huh?<eos> How's the patient?<eos> I'm better.<eos> This place is cool.<eos> Wait till you see your room.<eos> I have a room?<eos> You do now.<eos> Used to be mine.<eos> Want to see it?
'Cause of my father...<eos> Bad guy?<eos> Not at first.<eos> But he changed.<eos> That's when things got really crazy.<eos> But before that?<eos> It was home.<eos> It was nice.<eos> That's how you know you've really got a home.<eos> 'Cause when you leave it... There's this feeling that you can't shake.

Find Snow White.<eos> I shall destroy her happiness if it is the last thing I do.<eos> We did it.<eos> Your parents are together?<eos> They're right back on track. We're ready to go.<eos> I see.<eos> And you brought some luggage.<eos> Long story.<eos> So, how's the portal coming?<eos> Can you open it?
I cannot.<eos> Then what are you working on?<eos> Oh, this is for me.<eos> A forgetting potion.<eos> I know too much about my future.<eos> The only way to protect it is to forget it.<eos> Well, what about this wand?<eos> You said that could help us.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> Well, apparently only those who used the portal can reopen it.
Everything changes.<eos> Everything.<eos> - Tough time to be a cyborg.<eos> - Tough time to be anybody.<eos> Here.<eos> This might hurt a little.<eos> I swear that's your favorite part.<eos> My job has its perks.<eos> Hey, whatever happened with that?<eos> You know, I've been trying to fix that thing ever since the day you brought it in.
- I thought you were dead. - That makes two of us.<eos> And Briareos?<eos> Oh, come on. What do you think?<eos> Good.<eos> I didn't want to cause you two any more trouble.<eos> Trouble?<eos> You and Olson... You gave us purpose.<eos> Any way to stop this thing?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> I'm the one that made it come alive.
Not when it reflects dishonorably upon my command.<eos> This conflict will be conducted in a civil manner!<eos> Complement one, are you ready to fire?<eos> Well, uh... we'll likely hit the gallows, sir.<eos> If that's acceptable.<eos> No, it is not.<eos> You secured the prisoners, but not the powder!<eos> Complement two, adjust your quadrant, target the storehouse.<eos> Now!<eos> Assistance is on its way and I will not have the rebels absconding with our powder or using it against us.
So this raid is family business?<eos> It's personal?<eos> You saying you wouldn't do the same?<eos> No, no, I'm just saying it makes sense, is all. More sense than Washington sending you both here anyway.<eos> He granted me discretion to advance my mission as I see fit.<eos> Oh, I see. So you're gonna have to explain it all to him, then.<eos> Good. When you do, please inform 711 that his precious Mr. Culpepper is finished.<eos> - I am out.<eos> - Nobody is out.<eos> Your standing in this town is intact and I intend to keep it that way.
The spikes are filled with an engineered bioplasma.<eos> The serum is the source of Denny's quick regeneration.<eos> So we extract the fluid like a stem-cell procedure and inject it into the injury? Correct.<eos> In theory, this could promote radically advanced healing.<eos> Another theory is that Maggie's body rejects the serum and goes into anaphylactic shock.<eos> So this could kill her.<eos> The procedure could also injure Denny.<eos> There is a danger to a fluid extraction.<eos> Pull too much and you could trigger an epidermal hemorrhage, resulting in a coma.<eos> She'd do it for me.
Well, you look exactly the way I imagined you'd look in a three-way.<eos> Reading.<eos> Come on, we have that free money, and you love to gamble.<eos> Yeah, but nothing stupid, just, like, not using a condom.<eos> Oh, what the hell?<eos> Wait, wait, Nicky, Nicky, here.<eos> Here's your money.<eos> 200 on Mess in a Dress.<eos> Oh, wait, I think I have a mess in my dress.<eos> You got it, doll, and I'm sending over some of those special popovers.
Yes, of course.<eos> I understand we had a little detonation in the lab today.<eos> Those boys have a lot of bluster, but you certainly did a number on them.<eos> Nothing irreparable.<eos> I imagine you'll apologize.<eos> You have a long road ahead, Charlie.<eos> You've only just arrived.<eos> Is that why you gave me an unsolvable problem?<eos> Some kind of freshman hazing ritual?<eos> I gave you the velocity distribution problem because I think you're the only man here who's capable of solving it.
Your cheek-<eos> Yeah. It got cut.<eos> I think you got nicked.<eos> It's just a scrape.<eos> Jim- It's a worm.<eos> I need, uh, tweezers, a lighter - And where's that hydrogen peroxide?<eos> Doctor, a word, please?<eos> Uh, I need, uh, uh, paper towels, gloves and, uh, a knife.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm gonna out it out of you.
And according to the GPS, this picture was taken from inside this building.<eos> All right, well, let's see if we can find a way in.<eos> Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore.<eos> What's that stench?<eos> What a sad existence.<eos> Tony, there's a lot of people living in here.<eos> They're dying here, too.<eos> This building's been a nightmare.<eos> I've had a problem with drug addicts and the homeless.<eos> I board it up, they break in.
Will you watch Dave for a while?<eos> Sure.<eos> Wh-Why?<eos> My parents got me a bus ticket to Nebraska.<eos> You called them.<eos> That is... that's just so great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope so.<eos> What changed?<eos> Thinking about that video you showed me and what Blue would've said if he saw it.
Whoo-whoo!<eos> So what, you called them all?<eos> Yeah, you know, just in case.<eos> Max, you were right, and I was wrong.<eos> Your mother's really as bad as you said.<eos> Mm, oh, it's not that bad.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> She took you to the mall on finals day.<eos> Yeah, but it was the greatest day we ever had.<eos> We got ice cream, we ate it in the massage chairs at Brookstone, and then a kid fell in the fountain, and we died laughing.
You shouldn't be sad.<eos> You have lots of reasons to live.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - [clicks tongue] Um... give me a second.<eos> - Damn it, Violet.<eos> Get back in bed!<eos> - No!<eos> I want to go home!<eos> Sweetie, even if you leave the hospital, that baby is still coming out.<eos> Not if I hold it in.
- I got to go.<eos> - Go, go, go.<eos> I'm really glad you're okay.<eos> LUKE: Violet, this isn't funny anymore!<eos> You're doing very well.<eos> Let's try another push.<eos> [Christy and Bonnie join in] - I changed my mind.<eos> - [panting] I told you, you can't go home.<eos> You're having the baby.<eos> No, I want to keep it.
So I'm buying this bag and the lady tells me there's extra pockets inside to keep my kid's snacks in.<eos> And I'm like, "Does this body look like it's had a child, bitch?"<eos> So she calls her manager and...<eos> And you make out with him so he looks the other way and you steal the bag.<eos> Patrick, I told everybody at the beginning of session if you interrupt and don't have something deeply personal to say... ahem you have to suffer the consequences.<eos> - Stick out your tongue.<eos> - Not the habañero sauce.<eos> Rules are rules.<eos> Tongue.<eos> ( Groaning ) Now, here's the antidote, but you don't get it until you say something personal and revealing.
She's an unsanctified charlatan.<eos> And you?<eos> Who do you seek?<eos> Well, truth...<eos> Sorry, truth is, I'm not even sure she's dead.<eos> So I came here to find out.<eos> You see, my son and my daughter were taken from me when they were very small.<eos> Taken by the parish authorities and I never knew what happened to them.<eos> But lately... I've had a feeling.<eos> Like, a feeling... I can't put it into words.
They'll gonna come back for the piece, you know that? Nah.<eos> There ain't no way, man. You can trust me.<eos> The cops clipped their ass.<eos> You know how to use that? Shit.<eos> Point it at me, like you're gonna shoot me.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Come on.<eos> That's the way you hold a gun.<eos> It's the way I hold it, yeah.<eos> You know how to eject the clip? Empty it?
I may be saying this wrong.<eos> Balalaika.<eos> Balalaika.<eos> The name of a musical instrument, so she tells me.<eos> What do you say, pal? Does this strike a chord?<eos> You got 2 hours to get the money together.<eos> Tj?<eos> - Tj?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - Had to give you this. I told you to give it to Peter, not to come down here.
So I'm just gonna hold on to it.<eos> Embarrass the hell outta him later.<eos> Nolan, I don't see anything in your hand.<eos> To pass a urine test for a new job I'm up for.<eos> So I brought in this.<eos> Oh, good for you, Nolan. I'm glad you've made this decision.<eos> Yeah, I figured I'd get rid of half of this now and burn the rest at home.<eos> One joint at a time.<eos> Nolan, if you smoke any weed in the next two days, you'll never pass that drug test.<eos> Yeah, Nolan, just throw it in the can and let's smoke this place up.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How'd it go with Paul's girlfriend?<eos> Did you give her the birthday gift?<eos> Yeah, I gave her the gift.<eos> Did she like it?<eos> She said it was exactly what she needed.<eos> How could any woman like something so disgusting?<eos> I mean, just the idea of having something like that on my body...<eos> Hey, she liked it, okay?
- Nah.<eos> - No big.<eos> Well, so long as everybody's cool...<eos> - We're the coolest.<eos> LACEY: When in Rome.<eos> You know, I used to charge people to watch, so you guys, y'all got off easy.<eos> Okay.<eos> So that's done.<eos> Lacey, if you hate your new apartment, why don't you just look for another one?<eos> I can't afford it.
Have you seen a really good-looking guy, looks a little bit like George Clooney?<eos> Every day when I shave.<eos> You're Fred? !<eos> I sense you're feeling threatened.<eos> Don't beat yourself up.<eos> Not everybody could look like this.<eos> Hold on. Hold on.<eos> I'm paying you $500?<eos> No one's going to believe my friend gave up celibacy for you.<eos> Got into it, maybe, but not gave it up.
And I'm Furguson the cat.<eos> Okay, uh, tonight's Honey Roast, we're gonna keep it sweet, keep it positive, and most of all, we're gonna keep it cute. Am I right, Furguson?<eos> Hope that cat's not driving.<eos> How is a cat costume just lying around?<eos> She has four of them.<eos> I'm drinking a "Catbernet."<eos> - That's pretty good. - Okay.<eos> That's pretty good.<eos> A Pinot "meowoir..." Meow-oi-rr.<eos> If I have one more of these, you're gonna have to point this old kitty in the direction of my litter box because I'm gonna need to find it.
I, for one, am tired of seeing them attack our lines.<eos> I'm sure you are, too.<eos> That's why you're not gonna hold this outpost anymore. You're going to advance.<eos> But we've lost half our company.<eos> The English know that.<eos> That's why they keep attacking, taking a few of us each time, until we can't fight anymore and are forced to retreat.<eos> We're in danger of losing this war if we don't act.<eos> The soldiers that you repelled this morning come from the castle of Montmorency.<eos> That castle stands between us and our route to Calais.<eos> If we take it, we clear the way.
Durst.<eos> Great.<eos> Here's your welcome bag.<eos> Let me look up your badge.<eos> Hey, you want a good cry, read that.<eos> He lost 4 people on the 14th.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Um... looks like somebody already picked up your badge. What? I just got here.<eos> Well, somebody must have picked it up by mistake.
This is Wayne.<eos> Holy Wayne.<eos> Mmm, I don't think she's heard of me.<eos> No, she's here about Patrick Johansen.<eos> Who?<eos> The one who came to you just before you left for the ranch?<eos> Lost most of his family?<eos> He ended up writing a book? Oh, right.<eos> Right.<eos> I didn't read it.
Did he get a description of the guy on the bike?<eos> No, the only thing he said was that he was on a black sport bike with a top case on back.<eos> There's an alert out now.<eos> Ran plates on your vic's car.<eos> Turns out, it's not his.<eos> It's actually registered to Makana of Life Hawai'i.<eos> They're one of three groups in the state that recovers organ and tissues for transplant.<eos> We got keys?<eos> This car was being used to transport an organ.<eos> That guy on the bike must have jacked it.
Jack, why don't you take a minute to fill out your certificate of completion?<eos> Or, as the prison print shop calls it,<eos> "certificate of copulation."<eos> - You are a hypocrite.<eos> - What?<eos> You are telling these people that they're ready to function in the outside world, but then you won't even hire one of them.<eos> If you don't believe in Jack, you don't believe in this program.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I invented the program.<eos> I'm just not ready to test it by putting a professional thief in a house filled with all my cool stuff.
We see Sarah, boo-hoo. Maybe we leave a little early because Sally's so upset.<eos> We get in a taxi to the cemetery, but we get out in Greenwich Village.<eos> Two hours of shopping, take another pumpkin to grand central.<eos> There's a boutique on McDougal that has Pocahontas boots.<eos> I am upset, Carol.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I heard her dad's a mess.<eos> She was supposed to be a great beauty.<eos> Sarah had this picture of her wearing a bikini on Christmas.<eos> She took it with her.
I'm sorry if I said the wrong thing.<eos> Was that necessary?<eos> When she comes back from the ladies', have her hand over the keys.<eos> New York is on the line.<eos> Do you have to put them on the contraption?<eos> It's just Mr. Sterling.<eos> - This is Pete.<eos> - It's Roger.<eos> I appreciate you fighting for me.<eos> Well, Jim pled his case and we decided it's best to keep the business, but run it past Detroit.
You want to point fingers, or you want to help me find a truck?<eos> [Alarm sounds] Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61.<eos> Structure fire, 16th and Wabash.<eos> I can already see the smoke, boys.<eos> Looks like it's rolling.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Hey, Casey, we're neck-and-neck with your old pal, Welch.<eos> Don't worry, Casey, I got this.<eos> I'm not interested in a pissing contest.<eos> If Welch wants this fire, he can have it.
Why did you ignite the light bomb?<eos> We had no choice!<eos> He was right there! Right within my grasp!<eos> No way, Pops.<eos> He is here. Unhand me!<eos> For God's sake, this is suicide!<eos> No! No!<eos> No!<eos> Your pulse is slowing... and your heart is struggling, Eldritch.<eos> I can hear it.
I'm here to warn you of an urgent danger.<eos> There is a disease spreading through New York City and possibly beyond.<eos> This plague is responsible for the mysterious disappearances we've been seeing.<eos> These photographs show an autopsy I performed... on one of the victims.<eos> This strain, this virus... changes its host body... through a violent, corruptive metamorphosis.<eos> You can see a bizarre growth emanating from the throat, forming a kind of stinger through which a worm parasite passes... from the carrier to the victim.<eos> In fact, your loved ones, once they are turned, once they are infected, will come after you.<eos> Sunlight kills these-<eos> That's it. It's off.<eos> They stopped it. Whoo!
We got to get out of here.<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> - Now!<eos> - Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> What happened?<eos> The UN guards must've seen Vincent's handiwork.<eos> Come on!<eos> Hurry!<eos> I can't hold it much longer!
- Because I was there.<eos> - I was listening so I could make sure that I knew exactly what they were up to, so I could stop them.<eos> I made Jim look me in the eye and promise me that he wasn't gonna do anything.<eos> I don't know that I believe that.<eos> If you want to think that I'm the bad guy, then fine.<eos> Be prepared to think far worse of Sam Verdreaux.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Trying to find what you've been hiding from me.<eos> Like my mom's journal.<eos> I don't have it, Junior.

That was Lyle.
May I?<eos> Be careful.<eos> I've seen this before.<eos> You might want to call security.<eos> Lot of bees over there.<eos> They live in drawers.<eos> - Where's my sandwich?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> There were two.<eos> I traded it.

Well, you obviously didn't think it through. Did you?<eos> Because there's still a dead girl in Alison's grave that the police...<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> And I had nothing to do with it, and whether you believe me or not, Mom, that is the truth.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm not accusing you of anything right now but poor judgment.<eos> While you were gone, your father and I were dragged down to that precinct. What?<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> In Philly.<eos> They found your car and impounded it.

Jordan.<eos> That's a real pretty name for a real pretty woman.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You're not so bad yourself. Despite the fact that you nearly beat three men to death with your bare hands.<eos> Wow. What happened there?<eos> I was just workin' at the marina.<eos> I restore boats as a hobby.<eos> Working with your hands and... faded jeans.<eos> Go on.<eos> Well, I'm too much of a gentleman to tell you what those thugs did to my girl, but... after I was done with them I... ripped my shirt off and used it as a pillow under my lady's head.
Super.<eos> So, uh, are you a cook?<eos> Not a cook. No.<eos> The man who came to the house, he was driving a posh car. He looks rich.<eos> What does he do?<eos> - He works with horses.<eos> - Really?<eos> I love horses.<eos> - I've got a bay mare.<eos> - No! I ride it all the time.
Curious how that is to me and curious that it should be you.<eos> Opposites perhaps.<eos> Opposite, and that...<eos> That thing sticking in my heart, you own, you own part of that heart, you do.<eos> You do, Polly.<eos> You do.<eos> Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.<eos> Let's get you home. Come on.<eos> Look at this place, we own it!<eos> Put your money away before I take it off ya.
It can be awfully hard on the hands.<eos> My son. Michael. Where is he?<eos> Do you think I need a shave?<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> I need a shave, don't you think?<eos> Well, maybe it can wait till later.<eos> Your son has been having a hard time of it I'm told.<eos> And that is why I thought that you and I together, we should do whatever we can to get him freed.<eos> Now, I have a form here, a release form. With my signature, he can be freed by tomorrow morning at dawn.<eos> So sign it.

With my signature, he can be freed by tomorrow morning at dawn.<eos> So sign it.<eos> - He didn't do anything.<eos> -"Sign it, "Mr Campbell. Please, sir."
You mean inside information about Tommy Shelby's criminal empire?<eos> With respect, I would say I know more about Tommy's dealings than you do.<eos> He doesn't trouble the family with Irish business for instance, does he?<eos> No.<eos> So, no. It's not information I need.<eos> What else could you give me in return for my signature?<eos> I'm talking about a simple transaction here.<eos> I have a great curiosity.<eos> Like a magpie sees something, something shining in the mud.<eos> Oh, he has no need for the silver, but he takes it anyway.
What's your cookie dough laced with?<eos> No, I found this company. They help you locate old vehicles.<eos> It's called, "Dude, Where's My Car?"<eos> So what's so great about this thing?<eos> I don't know, it's my first car and I had a lot of firsts in it.<eos> First time I learned to drive, first time I had sex.<eos> First time I had a condom break.<eos> First time I prayed.<eos> So you gonna buy this car?<eos> No, some guy named Dirk, in Denver, has it.
I prodded plenty. You said he'd have a reaction.<eos> The only reaction I got was from my colleagues wondering if I'm working for the National Inquirer.<eos> Look, Beth, I know there's been a lot of back and forth on this, but...<eos> Can you hang on a minute?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah. Rewiring your neighbors, I just want to...<eos> I have proof-- a serum, that corrupts DNA.<eos> A serum?<eos> Back when I was running the precinct, we arrested a-a deranged scientist, Sam Landon.<eos> He developed it based on research the government used...
Nothing. It looks like they took it all.<eos> It's up to Martin now.<eos> A single drop is enough to kill.<eos> Now we have trust.<eos> So, how much have you got?<eos> I have five liters of concentrated weapon-grade VX nerve agent.<eos> I'll buy it all... market rate.<eos> $20 million.<eos> The product is already in the country.<eos> I assume that's why you came here to buy it... you have no smuggling expenses.

What are you saying?<eos> You know... a mercy killing.<eos> Those poor things.<eos> Oh, that's quite a solution.<eos> Did you know they killed their mother?<eos> And then one of them tried to kill the other.<eos> I forget which is which-- the two...<eos> Dessert time.<eos> My layered strawberry and lime Jell-O mold with marshmallows and fruit cocktail.<eos> I'll put it right over here.
I don't hear the percolator on.<eos> Dandy!<eos> Mother!<eos> Mother!<eos> Someone's broken into our home and murdered Dora.<eos> Oh, God, Dandy, what have you done?<eos> ! Oh, God! I'm sorry!<eos> She's a mother!<eos> She was saying awful things to me!<eos> Just like everything else in your life, I'm the one who has to clean it up. I'll help!
Is it MGM? Mm-mm. No.<eos> RKO?<eos> I work for the biggest network in television,<eos> WBN-- the Worldwide Broadcasting Network.<eos> As I'm sure you're aware, being a woman of the world, TV is the new thing.<eos> I would rather be boiled in oil than... be on television.<eos> You know, over 40% of this country's population owns a television set, Miss Mars.<eos> TV is the future.<eos> Squeezing the beauty and glamour of the silver screen into that little black and white box-- this is the future, Mr. Spencer?<eos> I find it very depressing.
They performed the first surgery separating Siamese twins.<eos> What does it say?<eos> "The 15-month-old Brodie twins "are in separate cots for the first time in their lives.<eos> "A 12-hour, 40-minute operation "severed the tissue, nerve cords and blood vessels that joined them."<eos> Look.<eos> Aren't they cute?<eos> Andsuddenlyit was clear why we were here.<eos> They're adorable.<eos> The lifetime it would take for me to save the money for the surgery?<eos> Dandy had it at his fingertips.
Shame about the dead one."<eos> Oh, darling.<eos> The other one still adores you, doesn't she? Let's give the one who likes you one of my fox stoles or a tennis bracelet.<eos> The other one will be green with envy and be practically begging for your affection in no time at all.<eos> I don't want to buy love!<eos> I wish you could be inside my body for one minute to know what it feels like to be me!<eos> It's like when I had tuberculosis, and you took me out to the Utah desert, and there was nothing but dry open space for hundreds of miles around us.<eos> That is what is inside of me.<eos> Those girls were a cool stream of glacier water.<eos> My heart bloomed as they nourished it.
Or what?<eos> You gonna kill me too?<eos> Give me the gun.<eos> Where is she?<eos> You tell that backstabbing Cossack to come find me!<eos> No time for sleep.<eos> We still got miles to go.<eos> Quicksilver.<eos> One of the few things that'll kill a demon like you.<eos> I believe your people refer to it as mercur.
That's facing it.<eos> I shoul forgive them?<eos> For hurting him?<eos> For trying to kill us?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> You think we have a choice?<eos> Not all of us.<eos> Just you.<eos> When he opens his eyes, the only thing he's gonna want to see is your face.<eos> Take it.
Before he heft, Mr Brisker was saying he wants to show us the della Francescas in the National Gallery when we're next in London.<eos> You go. Actually, I wouldn't mind knowing if ours is any good.<eos> We don't often see you for breakfast.<eos> We've got a meeting this morning to organise the church flowers.<eos> The rota seems to have gone wrong.<eos> Is Mary back today?<eos> - Supposed to be.<eos> - Good. We've been sent an intriguing proposition from a man in Leeds.<eos> What's that?<eos> Let's wait till Mary gets home, then we can all talk about it.
I hope you're not too tired after your exertions.<eos> Oh, m'lady, I'm not tired exactly.<eos> Oh, good. I'm glad if the wedding was a success.<eos> Oh. The wedding was a success, yes.<eos> Spratt, I have told you before, I do not appreciate a man of mystery.<eos> If you have something to say, say it.<eos> I would, Your Ladyship. But it may not be quite right for me to tell.<eos> Well, if that is the case, then do not say it.<eos> Do you have some other business?<eos> Only that it may not be mine to tell, but it is, in a way, yours.
So, you had fun?<eos> Don't ask me to elaborate.<eos> Have you set the date? For the wedding, m'lady?<eos> - No. - He's not trying to get out of it?<eos> No. But there's no hurry. We don't have to rush into it.<eos> By the way, would you do me the greatest possible favour?<eos> I will if I can.<eos> Would you hide this in the cottage?<eos> - You mean the thing?<eos> - Well, I can't leave it here.

And the book.
Go. Of course.<eos> You go.<eos> Every figure shows a different kind of reverence, some eager, some contemplative, some amazed.<eos> Even the magpie seems to have been struck dumb.<eos> You're very sharp.<eos> Umbria was full of magpies, so della Francesca chose a bird known for its chatter and made it silent in wonder.<eos> How beautiful it is.<eos> I think your picture may be a study for this angel.<eos> There are elements common to both.<eos> It was painted at the end of his life.
Good.<eos> Wipe the footage.<eos> Sir, this won't just go away.<eos> Wipe it.<eos> I want it gone.<eos> Whatever power that thing has, it's only getting stronger.<eos> Kryger and Molly were having hallucinations.<eos> Now we have a top scientist killing a man in cold blood.<eos> You can't be suggesting that we scrap the greatest discovery in the history of civilization.<eos> All I know is it went to great lengths to impregnate Molly.
What the hell did I do with my weed?<eos> Hey, Maureen.<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Everybody, this is Maureen.<eos> - Hey, everybody.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Officer.<eos> Charlie's going out with a cop?<eos> I've got to take a picture.<eos> Did you get it?
All right, but I was wondering, could you give me a little window of time like the cable company does?<eos> Damn, Charlie.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.<eos> I turned my phone off.<eos> I just broke up with this guy Travis and he keeps sending me angry emojis.<eos> One of them had a knife next to a high-heeled shoe.<eos> Do what you want to me, but don't threaten my babies.<eos> Well, turn it back on.

So let's try to remember what brought you two together in the first place.<eos> I mean, you know, besides ecstasy.<eos> She looks good from behind.<eos> He's a really good judge of ass.<eos> Shut up.<eos> No, you shut up.<eos> There you go.<eos> Now, while you two kiss and make up, I'm gonna take a picture.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I'll just send myself the other picture if I can find it.
I don't see one anywhere.<eos> Cuffs.<eos> Gloves.<eos> Need some slack, Ferg!<eos> Is she dead?<eos> She's breathing!<eos> How are we gonna get her up from down there?<eos> One of you two, throw down your cuffs.<eos> Grab hold of the rope!<eos> I got it.
The castle beset by death.<eos> Bodies laid out in the hall.<eos> It will happen, if my work is not done.<eos> Stay with Kenna and Pascal, please.<eos> How rare is the gift of sight. I don't believe you have it.<eos> I think you're a killer, feeding on others' fears.<eos> You're pagan-born.<eos> Deny it, but in your heart you know the gods have power.<eos> They demand respect. Blood.<eos> And if they don't get it...
I fear for its life, and yours as well.<eos> I don't mean to scare you. Are there words you want written down in case?<eos> Yes. But if there's any way you can save the baby...<eos> None that wouldn't kill you.<eos> "My dear friend, Mary.<eos> I am alone and my child struggles to join this world.<eos> I release you from your promise, from the protection our secret gave me.<eos> For Julien has died.<eos> And I'm afraid I may soon join him.<eos> Please, bring help. But if I die and the child survives, care for my baby as if it were your own.
What was that about?<eos> Rosamund, you spent the afternoon together.<eos> Did Edith mention anything was bothering her?<eos> Oh, she's just very tired.<eos> She'll be fit as a flea tomorrow.<eos> That's nice of you.<eos> I'll just let Mr Carson know.<eos> Could you leave it for a moment?<eos> He's given me his view about my money.<eos> He says I should put it into a building firm, W.P. Moss, or if not them, then into some other building opportunity.
Well, it certainly isn't mine.<eos> You know you're cutting off your nose to spite your face.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Well, what shall we do with your food?<eos> Eat it, and I hope it chokes you.<eos> That was a big success.<eos> What's your next suggestion?<eos> No, I don't think we need another plan.<eos> This was just a scene we had to play.<eos> Can you put the fricassee there and we'll share it?
Mr Barrow said you wanted me?<eos> Come in and sit down.<eos> Mrs Patmore's got something to say.<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, just how grateful I am for your excellent advice.<eos> Oh you've taken it, then?<eos> I have. In a way.<eos> You've invested in building?<eos> Well, she's investing in a building, yes.<eos> I've found a cottage in Haughton-le-Skerne and I'm going to see it on Tuesday.

In a way.<eos> You've invested in building?<eos> Well, she's investing in a building, yes.<eos> I've found a cottage in Haughton-le-Skerne and I'm going to see it on Tuesday.<eos> It's £300 so it's a big decision but you've given me the courage.<eos> That's not what I meant at all.<eos> I thought you wanted to be in the market, to increase your capital.<eos> Well, I'll rent it now and then later, I thought I might take in some lodgers.
Mr Boğaç, I'm Ahben Sonel.<eos> We're here about the film "Summits."<eos> Go away, I don't want you here.<eos> Get out! And damn your film!<eos> Mr Boğaç, if you could just listen.<eos> This film will be a comeback for you too, brother.<eos> I don't want your pity, I don't want it.<eos> - We destroyed the man, we finished him.<eos> - Look, I've brought the screenplay.<eos> If you could do me the honor of reading it.
Dad.<eos> Dad, come here!<eos> - What is it?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - Mom's phone. It moved.<eos> She's moving.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I lost my phone a couple months ago.<eos> I used this Web site to track it.<eos> So I thought, you know, maybe we could use it on her.
Use my city credentials, fly under the radar.<eos> Sure. - I could be your boss.<eos> - Assistant.<eos> - Boss.<eos> - Details.<eos> I always wanted to get into that building.<eos> Hey, baby. The world's about to end.<eos> Hey, where'd you get that phone?<eos> That's mine.<eos> It's my phone. I know you stole it.

Dad?<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Did you find Mom?<eos> Dr. Goodweather.<eos> Nora and I were just about to go over what we discovered.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> You didn't find her?<eos> No.<eos> I, uh- I did find her phone.<eos> I guess she lost it.
Do you think he knew Katie was pregnant?<eos> She didn't even know she was pregnant.<eos> But he knew something was up there.<eos> And he sent me on a fishing expedition.<eos> And then you come back pregnant.<eos> That's...<eos> That's how I know it's still alive.<eos> Think about it, Sam.<eos> Why would they go through all this trouble just to abort the baby?<eos> They're keeping it somewhere, and when I find it, I'm gonna be able to prove what they did to me.

Can you imagine?<eos> We have to talk.<eos> - Not now.<eos> - Now.<eos> Pearce is dead.<eos> You could be next.<eos> If this is about taking Sparks down, you have what you need.<eos> It's time to go public with the Aruna video and let the chips fall where they may.<eos> It's about more than that.<eos> I wanna see it.
- You're out of your depth here.<eos> - What about Katie's baby?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She was pregnant when she died.<eos> Just like I was.<eos> Guess you're the one out of your depth here, Alan.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wanna know where my baby is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I can find it.

It's a risk we must manage.<eos> I'm dying, Alan.<eos> The substance that sustains me has nearly been exhausted.<eos> Despite my best efforts, I have failed to reproduce it.<eos> We could do another mission.<eos> We could learn from the mistakes we made with the Aruna.<eos> Why send another mining expedition when we have in our possession perhaps something more valuable?<eos> Billions were spent locating the source of the substance, and we encounter the entity in the same location?<eos> It can't be coincidence.<eos> It's all the more reason to protect it.
You're bluffing.<eos> Am I?<eos> We understand who Malachi Strand used to be.<eos> What we're trying to determine is, who is he now?<eos> How's he changed?<eos> A few weeks ago, Malachi tried to extort me into giving favorable testimony by threatening the life of my friend.<eos> If Malachi is released, his abuse and corruption will only continue.<eos> Malachi's character has not changed.<eos> And jail is the only proper fate for a man like him.<eos> Ruby, as soon as there's a ruling on the parole hearing, I want to hear it.
Cooking's dangerous business.<eos> I moved myself up to management.<eos> So what are they cooking?<eos> More gutter meth?<eos> Nah.<eos> Meth's old news.<eos> That's cheese heroin.<eos> You never even heard of it, have you?<eos> Heroin, sleeping pills, a little strawberry flavoring.<eos> The after-school set loves it.
I kissed Joe.<eos> I know.<eos> I just wanted to feel normal for a minute.<eos> Melanie, you are normal.<eos> Nothing about me is normal.<eos> Why am I even here?<eos> Because I'm connected to some egg?<eos> And no one even knows where it is.<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> I dropped it in the lake a few minutes before I found you.
I mean, given how far we just walked, we should've hit the dome wall by now.<eos> Maybe the dome doesn't come down this far?<eos> Except that everything we know about it says that it does.<eos> You're sure you went right back there?<eos> Hey, you know what, man?<eos> I'm sick of you calling me a liar.<eos> Who the hell knows your story anyway? You show up the day the dome does.<eos> No one knows where you came from and you don't say.<eos> Well, shouldn't you be telling me what's going on?<eos> 'Cause you've known about the egg since 1988 when you and Melanie, Lyle, Pauline, when you all found it?
Because I thought his heart was in the right place.<eos> I was wrong about that.<eos> I don't think I'm wrong about you.<eos> Careful.<eos> The dust cleared out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what now?<eos> It's been hours.<eos> The egg knows we're here.<eos> I can feel it.
Hey.<eos> Have you ever tried Guinea pig?<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> You wouldn't call it a perk.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Dawn doesn't have to know. Come on.<eos> Well?<eos> It's good enough for Peru.<eos> It's a caravaggio.<eos> I found it on the street outside the high.
He was fine until the two of you were alone with him.<eos> Something happened.<eos> I want you to tell me.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Beth left to get some gauze.<eos> I was mopping.<eos> I must have unplugged the ventilator somehow.<eos> It only stopped for a minute.<eos> But that's...<eos> I got it working again.
To me, it's as if you'd joined us and now you're backing away.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> I want to explain why I think we should turn down Wavell's offer.<eos> I know. We are only the caretakers of Downton.<eos> But Papa, some things have to change.<eos> True. But we mustn't destroy what we're trying to protect.<eos> Wavell would wreck this lovely place for ever, with his ugly, cheap houses.<eos> But you can't block all development.<eos> I won't. I intend to expand, but without spoiling.<eos> I'm going to make a plan and find a solid builder who can fit in to the village and not ruin it.
You are calling this thing.<eos> I just need to know you're good.<eos> This is how things stop.<eos> I can't afford that right now.<eos> The world can't afford it.<eos> Listen, I took a pretty hard shot to the sack with that crash.<eos> I am stressed and depressed to see that ride die, but if you say we're rolling on,<eos> I'm good.<eos> We're rolling on.<eos> I'm gonna rub some dirt on it and walk it off.
It took a little horse trading to get you here, but it's plain as potatoes to me now.<eos> You get it.<eos> You could have lit out after the crash, made a case. But you stayed.<eos> - I made a deal.<eos> - Yeah, you could've broke it.<eos> What was I gonna do?<eos> You gonna put that thing away tonight?<eos> How about that?<eos> You gonna wrap that up?<eos> No, I'm gonna let it get some air.
Broad River is five miles west.<eos> At the very least, we stock up there before we find wheels.<eos> We got a vehicle.<eos> And it just so happens... it's got 500 gallons of water on it.<eos> About time things started going our way!<eos> Come on.<eos> Just once.<eos> Just one damn time.<eos> We'll find another ride.<eos> If there was a ride worth a shit in this town, we'd have seen it.
It was... it was goo you weren't here for it.<eos> She hanging in there?<eos> No.<eos> Are you gonna take the cross, too?<eos> If we nee it.
No.<eos> No. Branch, no, I'm not letting you spend your money on this.<eos> I will find some way to raise the cash.<eos> You can't bake sale your way out of this, cady.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Henry will really appreciate it.<eos> I'm not doing this for Henry.<eos> Besides, we both know it's not my money.<eos> I'm sure your dad will be thrilled when he finds out.<eos> He'll get it back.
Someone had to see where this guy came from or where he went.<eos> Yeah, this is esposito.<eos> Connect me with operations.<eos> Wait. Freeze that.<eos> Zoom in.<eos> Can't be.<eos> It is.<eos> That's castle.<eos> He's the one who dropped off the cash?<eos> Do you want me to run it again?
No.<eos> Then what's going on here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But there's got to be another explanation.<eos> I don't think there is.<eos> The video clearly shows castle out in the world, Not under duress.<eos> It changes the dynamics of the case.<eos> No, this is still a kidnapping.<eos> That video could be a fake.<eos> All it shows is castle throwing away a bag.
You guys, none of us knows the truth about castle.<eos> Not yet.<eos> And, espo, you know what?<eos> If you're wrong, then he was a victim.<eos> So instead of us just standing around Waiting for him to wake up, why don't we start By figuring out who owns that dinghy?<eos> Already on it.<eos> The boat had expired tags Registered to a curtis holt of savannah, georgia.<eos> We called holt.<eos> He said that he sold it Over a year ago at a garage sale.<eos> He can't recall who he sold it to.
And the position of the fenders Points to it being moored at a dock.<eos> Is there any way to know where that dock is?<eos> I could give you my best guess.<eos> The dinghy had a six-horse motor, Two hours worth of fuel if the tanks were full.<eos> After it ran dry, it drifted for... Four or five days.<eos> So based on wind and current vectors, It probably launched somewhere between rhode island Esposito:<eos> Looks like we caught a break.<eos> Turns out that sky-blue dinghy Was a standard white when it came out of the factory.<eos> And how does that help us?<eos> Well, the previous owner pimped it out.

There's no sign that anyone else has been here.<eos> 'cause no one comes here but me.<eos> This is my weekend place.<eos> This is your boat, correct?<eos> It would appear to be.<eos> If you don't know mr. Castle, Then how did he end up in this boat<eos> In the middle of the ocean? But I did notice that it was missing<eos> So your boat was missing, but you didn't report that?<eos> I mean, I don't -<eos> - I don't even know why I bought it.
I promise you... I did not pitch a tent here. I could not have.<eos> I saw it for myself, castle.<eos> I would never camp in this spot, Not after the research I did on "tropical storm."<eos> I can't even do this with you.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> Listen. You never wrote a book called "tropical storm," castle.<eos> Kate, wait.<eos> Listen.<eos> I started the book.<eos> I threw it out.
How did you not lose hope?<eos> I did lose hope, you know? But I...<eos> I would get it back.<eos> Developed rituals in order to hang on to it.<eos> Like what?<eos> It's...<eos> Stupid. It really doesn't matter.<eos> No, I'd like to know.<eos> I would stare at your photo on the murder board.<eos> That if I would look at it long enough every day, That that would keep you alive.
I must win this war for the Khan.<eos> And you think he will give me to you?<eos> Just like that?<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Do you desire a sip?<eos> I believe you need one.<eos> I just need your good words.<eos> In one of my darkest hours, cold and lost in the Wudang Mountains, my life was saved by a small yellow bird.<eos> How?<eos> I caught it and ate it.
I'm afraid."<eos> And I guess by instinct, I just said,<eos> "Don't you worry, son.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine."<eos> And you smiled at me.<eos> You know, that was the happiest moment of my life because for the first time ever, I felt like a man, that I could truly look after you, alone.<eos> Until I discovered... this.<eos> It turned me into a monster, obsessed with power, when all I really needed was you, your love.<eos> And now, through Belle, there's love in my life again.<eos> And once more, I've started it with a lie.
But even then, I'll be there in spirit.<eos> But that doesn't matter because I'm here now and you're not alone.<eos> And you know what I mean?<eos> And it's a nice thing.<eos> What was in the diary?<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> Turns out our parents didn't go off on some diplomatic mission like everyone thought.<eos> That was just a cover.<eos> For what?<eos> Read it.
Stop stalling and pull it out.<eos> No warning?<eos> Nothing?<eos> I take it back.<eos> No warning is better.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Poison.<eos> I'm guessing this means you don't have the antidote?<eos> No.<eos> I gave it to Finn to save Raven.
Then tell me how it feels.<eos> Like a hand is inside my chest...<eos> And it's squeezing my heart... tighter and tighter, and he won't let me go until it's over.<eos> "He"?<eos> What?<eos> "He" won't let go?<eos> It's not about that. - It isn't?<eos> - No, no.<eos> It's not about Neil telling you to leave your own house?<eos> He paid for it.
We have fun, you know?<eos> Were we supposed to bring our spouses?<eos> Hey, Cam? Cam, hey, look.<eos> Um, this is kind of work-only.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> They don't even know I'm here.<eos> I love this song.<eos> Let's dance. No, no.<eos> Nobody's -- nobody's dancing.<eos> Shh. Say it with your hips.
Oh, I'm great. I'm just great, Tom.<eos> Is Christine with you right now?<eos> No. I'm at a pharmacy, so... Fine.<eos> How much is left?<eos> What?<eos> The money that I gave you.<eos> How much is left?<eos> Uh, about 6,000.<eos> All right, Tom.<eos> What you need to do is you need to take that money, and you need to take half of it.
No.<eos> He escaped.<eos> Did anybody get hurt?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I'm gonna have to come in there and take a look around.<eos> Fuck you, Kevin.<eos> I haven't talked to your father in a month.<eos> What?<eos> I could, uh, ignore the crazy.<eos> Even he could ignore it for a while, but he just wouldn't shut the fuck up.
(Swinging music)<eos> (song) Do not believe You're always right away<eos> When the others say That's no use<eos> It does not help you It's annoying somehow<eos> It just makes you sad And rob energy<eos> In the end you still think You're just a mess<eos> Life is precious Come, do not throw it away
The dinner Was already hours ago.<eos> You always have such good ideas.<eos> Oh, and what about Oskar?<eos> He comes, When he is hungry.<eos> Right.<eos> Hunger?<eos> I have a hole in the belly.<eos> Actually you could Now breakfast.<eos> I was probably interrogated.<eos> You steal the fire-grass, Lose it And reward Should I cook?
You, Mr. Claw, I think this is firegrass.<eos> (Smacking)<eos> I do not get it, What you want from me.<eos> Actually quite simply, Chef... cook.<eos> I do not know, As I should say.<eos> Would it be possible for us The fire grass?<eos> - huh?<eos> - (smacks)<eos> You can forget that.<eos> But Mom, We stole it.

(Malicious laughter)<eos> (Balduin) Mom always did The fire grass in the oven.<eos> A stem almost reached The whole day.<eos> Then it was always Cuddly warm in the cave.<eos> And it smelled like in May On a spring day.<eos> I would be interested:<eos> Where does this firegrass grow?<eos> We had Times really much of it.<eos> Then it was gone.<eos> We have probably used it.
- Who are you, then?<eos> - A funny bird.<eos> - I just want to help you.<eos> - Oh thank you.<eos> However, I wear Only your luggage.<eos> - What?<eos> - Neck and leg fracture, people.<eos> - The fire grass!<eos> - Forgive me.<eos> - I need it.
Nothing to thank for, little friend.<eos> - Good luck, folks.<eos> - See you.<eos> (Gloomy music)<eos> (Fearfulness)<eos> (Sobbing)<eos> (Matilda) This is the thief.<eos> They have My firegras stolen.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I'll get it back right away.
(All) Bäh.<eos> Moment<eos> So.<eos> Oh.<eos> This fire grass Destroys my mountain.<eos> Is the fire-grass in the cave?<eos> Yes.<eos> - We want?<eos> - Count me in.<eos> We must find it, Before everything is destroyed.
We put it back.<eos> Let's just get the hell out of here.<eos> Now.<eos> I'll help.<eos> Fine.<eos> This car one of yours?<eos> - It's my car, sir.<eos> - You're blocking the sidewalk. Oh. Uh, right.<eos> I can...<eos> I can move it right now.
- Th-the door was open.<eos> - Oh, I'll kill him.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> - It can wait.<eos> Frank, you didn't lock up again.<eos> Speak.<eos> I-I-I came across this case...<eos> Commonwealth v. Mcginnis...<eos> Which says we can move for a faster verdict if we think the prosecution's evidence is insufficient.<eos> What you're suggesting is called a "Directed verdict." If we ask for it and get denied, all the public will hear is there's enough evidence to convict.
So guess what!<eos> Guess what!<eos> You go to jail, and I'm the shoddy lawyer who put you there!<eos> - I had a headache! It isn't...<eos> - Stop lying!<eos> Get out.<eos> I can't think with you here.<eos> She's not wrong, Annalise.<eos> - It's aspirin.<eos> We all buy it.
I was not.<eos> Where were you, then?<eos> Home, perhaps?<eos> Taking care of your wife?<eos> I hear she's recently been diagnosed with cancer.<eos> I was at a friend's.<eos> Okay.<eos> I only ask because there's something I find strange about the chain of custody on this video.<eos> Detective Gill testified that he received the video from the store owner at 8:00 P.M.<eos> But the logs say he didn't log it into custody until 2:09 A.M.
The human kazoo.<eos> Oh, a drum circle.<eos> Uh... can I help you, freak?<eos> No.<eos> There he is.<eos> His nipples are asymmetrical.<eos> This could ruin him.<eos> Milhouse, everyone here is a total freak.<eos> We have to find a way to completely humiliate Lassen.<eos> Get a picture of a restaurant check with no tip, put it online, say it was him.
Hup, hup. D'oh!<eos> Are you Mr. Clean?<eos> Compared to the rest of these people, yeah.<eos> So give the Tooth Fairy my forwarding address, 'cause it's pretty loose.<eos> About time.<eos> It's the only phone.<eos> You don't count.<eos> Maybe we should just give up on Lassen.<eos> No. This Ignis thing is the biggest deal of his life.<eos> And I'm gonna wreck it.
Yeah.<eos> They're not all cables.<eos> Does it know we're here?<eos> It's what invited us in.<eos> Now, this is the cortex vault, a supplementary electronic brain.<eos> Memory banks, but...more than that.<eos> This is what keeps the Dalek...pure.<eos> How are Daleks pure?<eos> Dalek mutants are born hating - this is what stokes the fire, extinguishes even the tiniest glimmer of kindness or compassion.<eos> Imagine the worst possible thing in the universe, then don't bother, because you're looking at it right now.
They're going to fire me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thought if I kept my head down and... did my job--<eos> I guess that's not what they want.<eos> What do they want?<eos> They want me to move on.<eos> Well, maybe you should.<eos> Aren't you tired of fighting?<eos> Yes.<eos> I guess I could see it as an opportunity.
No one will fucking touch it now.<eos> You went to his house.<eos> What would I have seen if I had taken pictures of you, Ray?<eos> How many fucking women would there be?<eos> I need you to sign these papers.<eos> What are they?<eos> Loan papers for the new house.<eos> I don't want it anymore.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Don't you get it?
How do you catch a football?<eos> - I hold out my arms, and I catch.<eos> - I tried that once.<eos> Didn't work.<eos> If magic is like science, then it can be learned.<eos> - How did you make the ground shake?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I saw Bates with my mum, and that freaked me out.<eos> OK...<eos> Try remembering that feeling, harnessing it.
I know it feels strange, but just give it a chance.<eos> - You two might hit it off.<eos> - He's my science teacher.<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Ah, welcome.<eos> Jake, I'll give you the grand tour.<eos> No, you better give your shoes a spritz. You've got half of Bremin on them.<eos> Wow, this smells fantastic.<eos> Yeah, I backpacked through Italy after uni and came across this recipe in a little village there.<eos> Of course, I've refined it over time.
The same universe we were in when we went missing.<eos> I hope that crazy isn't contagious.<eos> Take this.<eos> Can't you just do what someone says for once?<eos> Means a lot coming from you.<eos> Prepare to have your perception altered.<eos> Divinity of the Elements, I summon thee.<eos> Through this world, we can see.<eos> Another place where we can be.<eos> Take the Fire, make it burn.

I want my sister!<eos> - There's no time.<eos> - You promised, Felix!<eos> Divinity of the Elements, I summon Thee...<eos> Order must be restored.<eos> Through this world, we can see another place where we can be.<eos> Phoebe, get off him!<eos> Felix!<eos> Take the fire, make it burn.

Just a few things to add to 15 Division's haul.<eos> [Scoffs] 15's haul?<eos> Yeah, the basement was ours.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> No, the deal was, we're in charge.<eos> That was your staff's orders.<eos> You know, I'm happy to call him back so he can tell you where to shove those orders.<eos> [Scoffs] You want me to dial?<eos> Tell you what.<eos> You guys keep the cash... uncontested... add it to 27 Division's tally.
We called your, uh, lawyer. Oh, yeah?<eos> What did he say?<eos> You want to tell us why Lee Baker's at your house, digging around for money?<eos> I'm not sure I understand the question.<eos> He has Myrna, and he's threatening to hurt her.<eos> So you want to keep jerking us around, or are you gonna tell us what's going on?<eos> What?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I heard you guys come up to the door, and I hid some bail money.<eos> I didn't want you to take it with the rest of my stuff.
And, you know... [Chuckles]<eos> - All-expense-paid trip to Hawaii coming up, right?<eos> - Myrna?<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, we're here to save you from Lee Baker, but, apparently, that's not necessary.<eos> You don't understand...<eos> I've been married to him for 10 years, and he does the most ridiculous things with our money, and he never buys anything for me. I bought that ring myself.<eos> And I know there's more money here.<eos> I know there is, and I deserve it.
Are you up to it?<eos> I am.<eos> You'll call the Wroclaw zoo and ask them for a baboon.<eos> Tell them a man's life's at stake.<eos> We'll hook him up to a pig's or monkey's heart. and try to find a new donor.<eos> Let's do it!<eos> It stinks like a human inside. 18.<eos> That's it.<eos> A fine specimen.<eos> Now you have to put it to sleep.
Who?<eos> The pig!<eos> I don't know! What do you want me to do?<eos> An autopsy?<eos> We gave it valium, and it got a heart attack.<eos> Pigs are sensitive.<eos> What?<eos> Another one?<eos> Yes. of course.<eos> Take it out.
Well, sounds like I'm gonna be a long-term customer.<eos> - Marco. - Uh...<eos> What's this?<eos> A down payment on a Hankmed retainer. Oh.<eos> You take cash, right?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> I think we do.<eos> Is that a picture of Ricky at the party?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How did, uh, Snarkhampton get it?
Thank you, mama. Of course, sweetie.<eos> Red bull.<eos> Vodka.<eos> Smile.<eos> Excuse me? You should smile.<eos> Smile. Yeah, you're right.<eos> I had a shit day today. Mm-hmm. And like an idiot,<eos> Oh, my God, you're right.<eos> Right? Smiling is the best.<eos> You know, you should write a book and call it "smiling:
Cherub, there's sausage for you.<eos> - Want some?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Would you like some Riesling?<eos> - Please.<eos> Wait, I have some.<eos> Flavia?<eos> Some cabbage.<eos> Cabbage...<eos> I like to eat it with mustard.
That has a direct impact on Henry's trial.<eos> I would've thought that would've mattered to you. It does.<eos> But I'm not gonna hunt down David Ridges and kill him, which seems to be the only plan you have right now.<eos> I'm going to Denver for a couple of days... try and make some sense of this new Darius information.<eos> I expect you to be here helping us out, investigating.<eos> Now, you think you can do that?<eos> Honestly, Walt...<eos> I don't know.<eos> How's your knee?<eos> It's not good, but I'm gonna live.
- I thought we said no guns.<eos> - That was your idea.<eos> Now, I don't see anything, but we can't risk that thing coming back.<eos> We need to call someone. W-we can't.<eos> We left our cellphones at home.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> With all that's going on at work, it would have been harder for me to relax if I didn't have all this stuff.<eos> It's fine.<eos> The cellphone's almost dead.<eos> Well, give it to me.
You can tell me.<eos> I didn't call anybody.<eos> I thought you said you and your wife had some car trouble.<eos> We did.<eos> And you sent her all the way over here, then, to borrow a phone?<eos> And you already had one.<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> Come on, Sean.<eos> The phone was dead.<eos> We had to charge it.
Where'd you move it?<eos> Don't be signaling each other.<eos> Answer up.<eos> - I...<eos> -The bank.<eos> Father moved everything to a safe deposit in the bank.<eos> That's right.<eos> All the valuables. Quite some time back.<eos> What's a safe deposit?<eos> They lock it up for you.
- I...<eos> -The bank.<eos> Father moved everything to a safe deposit in the bank.<eos> That's right.<eos> All the valuables. Quite some time back.<eos> What's a safe deposit?<eos> They lock it up for you.<eos> Inside the vault.<eos> Yes.<eos> We could go get it. - Fem and I.

Family out there with him?<eos> His oldest, Will. We're close. Like a son to me.<eos> Assistant US Attorney in Manhattan.<eos> You walk close to the edge.<eos> - There's no law against inside information. -(CHUCKLES)<eos> Knock wood.<eos> Oh, I took the liberty of ordering for both of us.<eos> What on God's green earth?<eos> Veal parmigiana.<eos> Chef Vola takes an entire veal chop, slices it lengthwise, breaded, fried in olive oil, drowned in cheese and tomato sauce.
What is it?<eos> Man says to the waiter, "Now, see here.<eos> I've found a button in my salad."<eos> "Oh, that's all right, sir.<eos> It's part of the dressing."<eos> You all right there?<eos> Very well, thank you.<eos> Why is the railing so far away?<eos> Baby steps.<eos> You can swing it.
Next time you see the Commodore...<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Well, maybe one of the firehouses...<eos> Eli, you need to trust me, okay?<eos> Nuck.<eos> - Hey, Nuck.<eos> - What?<eos> Last Sunday, I went with June and her parents up to Brigantine.<eos> We're all walking along the shore and she goes, "I lost my hair ribbon.<eos> Help me find it."
Where did you learn what's proper?<eos> 915 Haddon Avenue.<eos> There's no Haddon Avenue in Atlantic City.<eos> It's in Trenton.<eos> Whose house is that?<eos> Nobody's house.<eos> Is it a school?<eos> Is it an orphanage?<eos> My name is in that book.<eos> If you take it, you're stealing from me and you're certainly no gentleman.
Ask the new boss.<eos> You know, there's things I can do for you.<eos> Sure.<eos> You can sweep the sand.<eos> Sorry?<eos> That's 1,000. Maybe more.<eos> Go be a plumber or a bookkeeper or the president.<eos> Sir?<eos> Just take the money.<eos> Take it.
Hard to say for sure, but it might have formed when your dad dropped you from the jungle gym.<eos> So I did get a condition from my father.<eos> Speaking of which...<eos> Your blood work came back.<eos> Now, I just need to confirm that you want the result of your Huntington's test.<eos> - I do.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thank you, Hank.<eos> Really.<eos> I was so sure I had it, I...
- Is dropping to what?<eos> - It's...<eos> The baby is in distress, and your B.P. is dropping.<eos> - A placental abruption?<eos> - It's possible.<eos> Let's get that C-section now.<eos> There's a lot happening here too, so just tell me what's going on.<eos> It's begun.<eos> I've broken my leg.<eos> You broke it now?
Did you kill Nicole Raymond?<eos> Man, I never killed anybody.<eos> What?<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> You believe him?<eos> Agents.<eos> It looks bad, but Zach didn't do this.<eos> He's probably gonna get the needle.<eos> Obviously, if there's anything you can do, it'd be appreciated.<eos> If he's telling the truth, then Raymond killed his wife and then dumped the car in a bad neighborhood just hoping somebody would steal it.
Well, Jane thinks they ran the red light on purpose.<eos> The photograph would give Raymond an airtight alibi.<eos> Can I see that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't do it fast.<eos> Do it right.<eos> We have nothing approaching hard evidence.<eos> Yeah, well, that's where you come in.<eos> This is where the red light photo was taken.<eos> They dumped the car here, where Jefferson found it.
He told me how he'd found out and threatened to ruin this young painter.<eos> And mother relented and stayed.<eos> Father took pride in having won her back.<eos> He said it was just a dalliance that she'd forgotten.<eos> But he was wrong.<eos> She never forgave him.<eos> And I never forgave her.<eos> She donated millions of dollars to secretly keep this painting on display...<eos> And one day die in front of it.<eos> I hope she saw it.
Previously on Covert Affairs..<eos> Well, I thought about your offer.<eos> I'm gonna take you up on it.
Well, I thought about your offer.<eos> I'm gonna take you up on it.<eos> Outstanding.<eos> We haven't met.<eos> I'm Caitlyn Cook.<eos> - Arthur Campbell.<eos> - Oh, I know who you are.<eos> Everybody knows who you are.<eos> DNI's office is putting together a team.<eos> They're coordinating it out of the NCTC.
You think you might be able to find out who it is?<eos> I can sure as hell try.<eos> Thanks, Roger.<eos> Send me whatever you got the moment you get it.<eos> I'll give you my email address.<eos> I don't have a computer anymore.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> Here...<eos> Ah. I'll call you on this phone when I find something.<eos> I tweaked it to work on frequencies beyond a scanner's range-- no GPS either.
He's hungry.<eos> I can get him food.<eos> Not that kind of hungry.<eos> I wouldn't answer that.<eos> I think it's time we had a talk.<eos> You took my baby from me?<eos> We thought we could lessen the danger with it under our control.<eos> We were wrong.<eos> We took away the one thing it truly needed... its mother.<eos> And that didn't occur to you when you were cutting it out of my body?

We need to talk.<eos> Of course.<eos> I-I just spoke to my wife.<eos> She said that you've sent someone to go with her t-t-to meet this thing.<eos> Yes.<eos> Dr. Mason.<eos> He's extremely capable.<eos> Tha-That's not the point.<eos> I come to you for help.<eos> I-I-I tell you about this... situation, the danger of this thing, and you sent my wife off t-to meet it?

I remember she fell in trying to grab a lily pad.<eos> You were so worried she'd get an infection.<eos> It's not fair, Alan, bringing me back here.<eos> I brought Mrs. Wimberley's truck.<eos> My car barely made it up the hill.<eos> Anya, after you see what I want to show you... if you still want to go, I promise I'll bring you back.<eos> You sure?<eos> Drones don't lie.<eos> This is Anya Sparks' car.<eos> Sparks must have figured out someone could find it.
Harmon.<eos> God.<eos> God.<eos> - Breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> - The baby's not here.<eos> Molly, it used you to get here for a reason.<eos> It's getting stronger.<eos> You brought it here.<eos> You have to stop it.
A few weeks ago, an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world.<eos> Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead, we still don't know.<eos> Every day it tests our limits, bringing out the best and the worst in us.<eos> Some say we'll be stuck here forever, but we will never stop fighting to find a way out.<eos> You killed a 19-year-old girl that your nephew loved!<eos> I had to!<eos> I need to get a message to someone on the inside.<eos> Why don't you write down what you want to say and where you want to send it.<eos> "So get the egg and bring it with you."
Will do.<eos> Do you think he knows?<eos> About Barbie being alive?<eos> He was asking a lot of questions.<eos> Exactly why we have to keep this to ourselves until we know he's okay.<eos> He might send another e-mail.<eos> Doubt they'll let him.<eos> Maybe the guys who took Barbie are the same ones who want the egg.<eos> How would they even know about it?<eos> Better question is, what would they do if they got a hold of it?
The egg?<eos> I thought she got rid of that thing. She tried to.<eos> The thing kind of has a mind of its own.<eos> And you all think it powers the dome.<eos> That's the-the working theory, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I bet that's why those guards are back.<eos> Where is it now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, as the only two lawmen left in this town, we'd better track it down.
- Let go! - No, don't!<eos> You're all right.<eos> I'm Rabbi Cohen.<eos> Cohen, like you.<eos> I'm sorry for what Lenny did.<eos> He's been reprimanded.<eos> It's not our way. Are you OK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Max, you have to give us the number.<eos> What is it?
Something that forces them to peak, then break, then roll.<eos> Does that make sense to you?<eos> Probably not. lf you understood, I probably wouldn't be saying it.<eos> Say a big swell hits Hawaii, and you ride one of those huge waves.<eos> The wave folds back together on the other side of the island.<eos> Then back out across the ocean, to wherever it needs to go.<eos> All you would need to do to ride it again, is find out where it's heading, and beat it there, however you can.<eos> That's what I've been doing.<eos> I'm trying to figure it out.<eos> Why, when the wave's just right, when it's big and hollow enough, and I'm inside of it, everything, whatever I'm doing, why I'm doing it ... ln that moment, it all makes sense.
- Happy birthday...<eos> - No! No!<eos> No happy, no singing.<eos> ALLY: No! It's not my birthday yet.<eos> MAN: Ally McBeal?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - I have a summons. - A summons for what?<eos> A summons for you!<eos> RICHARD: Elaine!<eos> - She'll love it!
We've helped him face his terror in a quieter battle.<eos> And now we must try to help him in the same way.<eos> So, what kind of terror are we talking about here, Delenn?<eos> The kind that cripples. The kind that destroys.<eos> Not from without, but from within.<eos> As soon as he can stand, whether he is fully healed or not Tannier will prepare to face his terror.<eos> Those who harm him now have power over him.<eos> He must take back that power or he will never be whole again.<eos> We will go with him and bring him to the point of his terror.<eos> And then he will face it.
And there was a tall tree standing where she had been the night before.<eos> A willow.<eos> Its delicate branches touching my face like tears.<eos> It remained there by the river, long after I had gone to dust.<eos> If there was a straight answer buried in there somewhere, I sure didn't see it.<eos> It was a parable.<eos> The willow is deceptively strong.<eos> It bends, but it does not break.<eos> Its roots are deep and can withstand the worst storm.<eos> It promises rest and shade and cool breezes to those who would find rest beneath it.
She's gonna have it tough, that slayer.<eos> She's just a kid.<eos> A world full of big, bad things.<eos> I wanna help her.<eos> I want...<eos> I wanna become someone.<eos> God, jeez, look at ya!<eos> She must be prettier than the last slayer.<eos> This isn't gonna be easy.<eos> The more you live in this world, the more you see how apart from it you really are.
For the freshness.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Don't fall on this.<eos> - Welcome to the future.<eos> - To the future!<eos> Puppy got out.<eos> Cordelia Chase. What did she wish for?<eos> I had no idea her wish would be so exciting.<eos> Brave new world.<eos> I hope she likes it.
I never thought members would kill members.<eos> You think the Owls took the cross?<eos> You have proof they killed Le Fur?<eos> Who else would know we'd finally found it?<eos> We've been searching for the Crucifixion cross for eight centuries, as have others.<eos> - They would never have given it up so easily.<eos> - Been a change in your ideology?<eos> Of course not.<eos> But we're working against the hysteria caused by these times.<eos> We defeat our entire purpose if we succumb to it.
No. But we might be able to hide it from them.<eos> Captain? The probe surveyed a class-6 gas giant this morning.<eos> I think we should send it back for a closer look.<eos> You're going to steer the probe into a gas giant.<eos> Captain... the atmospheric pressure will crush it.<eos> Not if the Borg shielding does its job.<eos> Hail them again.<eos> No response.<eos> Voyager to Malon vessel. Break off your pursuit.<eos> The probe is entering the giant's upper atmosphere and the Malon vessel is following it in.
Karin's dead.<eos> It's done now.<eos> No more.<eos> (Mulder) The authorities made a detailed examination of the soil and roots in the Rich family orchard, but could not explain what pulled Karin Matthews' body into the Michigan mud.<eos> Nor could they determine how the body of her father was pulled from its grave into her root cellar three years earlier<eos> Forensic data is inconclusive, but I believe the explanation lies in hospital records from Karin's childhood, which suggest she herself was a victim of abuse.<eos> Rage, unconfronted, takes its own path.<eos> I believe Karin's unconfronted rage forced her to face her buried father<eos> This same rage made her imagine victims in the children around hen trying to instil in them the strength she never found in herself<eos> What happened to Karin in the orchard that night was a release. Release for a victim who, unable to face up to her own past, was finally consumed by it.
But we desperately need money!<eos> I have a son lying sick at home.<eos> But the doctor took off and abandoned this dying city!<eos> There's no one left in this city I can take him to!<eos> That's why, I... I...<eos> Everyone and everything went wrong after the plant malfunctioned!<eos> But not everyone is rich enough to leave the city!<eos> We need money to call the engineers to fix the plant!<eos> If we don't fix it, this city is through!<eos> Along with everyone in it.
Dad...<eos> I want you to set it up now.<eos> Hey, why are you in such a hurry?<eos> Lain...<eos> I'll do it.<eos> You can't keep using that children's Navi forever.<eos> For communication, you need a powerful system that will mature alongside your relationships with people.<eos> Come here.<eos> Register yourself as the machine's user.<eos> Try talking to it.
My pigeons!<eos> Leave them alone!<eos> Thief!<eos> I'll teach you to steal my pigeons!<eos> Give it back, you bastard!<eos> Just you wait, dammit!<eos> Give me back that pigeon!<eos> Or I'II...<eos> Drop that pigeon!<eos> Look what he did to it!
I thought synthetics were logical.<eos> You just a big old psycho, girl!<eos> You're a robot?<eos> You're a Second Gen, aren't you?<eos> You're an Auton?<eos> Robots designed by robots, right?<eos> Ha!<eos> I remember.<eos> They were meant to revitalise the synthetic industry.<eos> Instead they buried it.
Didn't expect to see you here.<eos> Well, I'm still Crew Ops at the Control Center.<eos> I suppose the fact that I discovered the message means I have PR value.<eos> Of course.<eos> I know you must think this is all very unfair.<eos> And maybe that's an understatement.<eos> What you don't know is, I agree.<eos> I wish the world was a place where fair was the bottom line where the idealism you showed at the hearing was rewarded not taken advantage of.<eos> Unfortunately, we don't live in that world.<eos> Funny I always believed the world is what we make of it.
During the six weeks we'd been married,... ..l successfully avoided most of my husbandly duties.<eos> Throughout July, I'd been offering Charlotte various sleeping tablets,... ..which she gobbled down happily.<eos> She was a great taker of pills.<eos> # Oh, is it any wonder... The last dose I had tried had knocked her out for four hours.<eos> But that was not enough to guarantee me an undisturbed night.<eos> Hum...<eos> I think I must be immune.<eos> What would you give me if you wanted to uh... ..to knock out... ..say, a cow?<eos> J - Just for... seven or eight hours.<eos> So that... ..you know, the cow... would stay asleep? Even if you were tossing and turning next to it.
Just stay safe.<eos> Remember... ... themailman'smoreimportant than the mail.<eos> Boy, he's smart.<eos> When I was a kid we used to turn our hat around backwards.<eos> Thought it was cool.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Damn!<eos> I missed him.<eos> What's the name of this town?<eos> We never named it.
- By God, they'll starve.<eos> The land won't produce for the likes of them.<eos> Larry, did you sign the farm over to Ginny and Rose?<eos> I don't care about going to gaol.<eos> Nobody's going to gaol, Larry.<eos> It isn't that kind of trial.<eos> We're talking about the farm.<eos> Your farm.<eos> The one your dad and granddad built.<eos> What happened to it?
It was all underwater.<eos> I told them that.<eos> Every last bit of it, underwater.<eos> We laid the tiles.<eos> Dug the drainage well.<eos> No machinery, did it all by hand.<eos> My granddad, my dad... then me.<eos> - Yes, your farm.<eos> - My farm.<eos> What'd you do with it?
Whoever killed Flemming was some ghost?<eos> Could be.<eos> Nothing surprises me anymore.<eos> So, what have you got on Flemming?<eos> Bigtime financial adviser.<eos> Handled money for the biggest names in town.<eos> And look at this.<eos> One of Flemming's clients Caribbean Imports.<eos> Caribbean Imports keeps coming up.<eos> Do we know anything about this company other than that everyone associated with it ends up dead?
They're laying in a new course. Heading?<eos> Straight for Cardassia.<eos> Dukat's ship is breaking formation. He's going after the Dominion fleet.<eos> Open a channel.<eos> Dukat, stop trying to be a hero.<eos> Get back to the station.<eos> Your concern is touching, Major.<eos> But I think you misunderstand me.<eos> I'm not attacking the Dominion fleet.<eos> I'm joining it. What are you talking about?
Garak!<eos> He stabbed me.<eos> Chief, why would Garak do this?<eos> Come on.<eos> He may still be close by.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Garak's on our side.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> The psychotropic drug.<eos> He must have been exposed to it.
The fourth name is Silaran Prin a Cardassian living on a planet near the DMZ.<eos> A creature, born within the comforting anonymity of darkness awakens in the harsh truth of daylight. It squirms in the glare afraid of the light that pins it to the chair like a needle through its heart.<eos> Its heart beats faster...<eos> Who's there?<eos> Silaran, is that you?<eos> Panic starts to creep into its soul.<eos> Does it understand?<eos> Or is it so blinded by the light that it can think only of returning to the velvet cloak of darkness?<eos> No matter.<eos> Perhaps it is better that it doesn't realize how close death has come.
Don't do this.<eos> It isn't right.<eos> Chakotay.<eos> I know. We're back.<eos> That's it. That must be the anomaly.<eos> That's what's behind all this.<eos> It's exerting a gravitomagnetic force.<eos> We've got to get away from it. Divert all power to the engines.<eos> Changing course.<eos> We're still being drawn toward it. Reverse engines.
- Those were her dying words?<eos> - According to a 911 call we received...<eos> - Who made that call?<eos> - A nut.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> There were no dying words.<eos> Penny Timmons' larynx was severed.<eos> She couldn't cry for help even if there was help to cry for.<eos> - And no one followed up on this lead?<eos> - No. But, uh... ..I'll have someone get you the number and you can follow up on it.
Thank you.<eos> Hello, Jan. Hello.<eos> Bess.<eos> Why don't you have any church bells?<eos> We do not need bells in our church to worship God.<eos> I like church bells.<eos> Let's put them back again.<eos> Have fun.<eos> But now, friends, things have become very different.<eos> It hurts me to have to say it, but there appears to be those in the church who are prepared to cling to the world instead of fleeing from it.
- Oh, God.<eos> Oh, how awful!<eos> Are we going to get them out?<eos> Quick!<eos> Am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have left?<eos> A little in our can. We have, uh, water in the radiator, which can be drunk.<eos> And, uh, that's not cowardly at all.<eos> It's extremely practical. We, uh<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> There's also a plant. I've never seen it, but I believe you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant, and the next morning it'll be filled with a delicious liquid.
- Holla, Barnardo.<eos> BARNARDO:<eos> Say what, is Horatio there?<eos> A piece of him.<eos> Welcome, Horatio.<eos> Welcome, good Marcellus.<eos> - What, has this thing appeared again?<eos> - I have seen nothing.<eos> Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.<eos> Therefore I have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it.
What I have done that might your nature, honor, and exception roughly awake I here proclaim was madness.<eos> Was't Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.<eos> If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away, and when he's not himself does wrong Laertes then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.<eos> Who does it, then?<eos> His madness.<eos> If't be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged.<eos> His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, in this audience, let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that I have shot mine arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother.<eos> I am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge.<eos> But in my terms of honor I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement until by some elder masters of known honor I have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored.<eos> But till that time, I do receive your offered love like love and will not wrong it.
- I know.<eos> From who, though?<eos> - What's the big deal?<eos> It's a watch.<eos> - It looks like one I used to own.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Just tell me where you got the watch.<eos> - I won't tell you anything.<eos> - Francis, that is my old watch.<eos> I gave it to Heather when I got my TV.
Can anyone here tell...<eos> Quiet!<eos> He says you look exceedingly familiar.<eos> He wants to know if he's met you afore.<eos> I suppose it's possible.<eos> I'm afraid all rats look the same to me.<eos> He says he was discharging an obligation to the marquis de Carabas.<eos> Oh, It's that rat?<eos> Yes, actually, we've met.<eos> Actually, I think I threw the TV remote at it.
But this couldn't have happened, not in this amount of time.<eos> What year is this?<eos> This is the last year and the last day and the last hour of your life.<eos> Seventeen years since you began your great crusade.<eos> Seventeen--<eos> I am tired.<eos> Take him back to his cell.<eos> Sheridan, make your peace with whatever gods you worship.<eos> You will meet them next time I send for you.<eos> I cannot recall my world from what it has become but I can thank you properly for your role in it.
I know you.<eos> But you're...<eos> I don't wanna be rude, but you're a little...<eos> Older. Seventeen years.<eos> The me you met was from 1899.<eos> The me you now see before you is from 1916.<eos> - Is it okay if I get a headache?<eos> - That's quite all right.<eos> After our escapade, Tempus escaped and built his own time machine.<eos> He did something rather unique with it.
Another thing.<eos> You realise I can't possibly allow you to see or communicate with her ever again?<eos> Having to lie to him.<eos> That's what I couldn't bear.<eos> Yes, we know that, Gerald.<eos> But you must understand it was essential.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't approve of jealousy any more than you do.<eos> But, no doubt, if one's afflicted with it, there's very little one can do about it.
I'm tellin' you he killed 'em. He fucked 'em. He cooked 'em up.<eos> He ain't got a goddamn conscience.<eos> You understand what I'm sayin'?<eos> He'd just as soon slit our goddamn throats in the middle of the night as walk.<eos> Course, someone your age, Jesus, if you was to put one in him...<eos> "Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett Slays Cole Wilson."<eos> William Blake, do you know how to use this weapon?<eos> - Not really.<eos> - That weapon will replace your tongue.<eos> You will learn to speak through it, and your poetry will now be written with blood.
You will marry far better than the Dashwood girls.<eos> But I have no dowry.<eos> There are other important qualities that you have in abundance.<eos> It would not surprise me if you married beyond your expectations.<eos> Oh, I wish that might be so.<eos> There is a young man...<eos> Is he of good fortune and breeding?<eos> Of both.<eos> But his family would certainly oppose the match.<eos> They will allow it as soon as they see you.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Stardust proudly presents<eos> Miss Cristal Connors.<eos> We could've brought anyone into this show.<eos> Latoya, Suzanne, you name it.<eos> We wanted Cristal. Cristal Connors defines what Las Vegas is all about.<eos> She's dazzling, she's exciting, and she's very, very sexy.<eos> How does it feel to be back in Vegas?<eos> How did you feel about the show tonight?<eos> It's the best show I've ever been in.<eos> I only hope I can do it justice.
I ran a micro-cellular analysis of the Caretaker's remains, and discovered a critical enzyme in his cellular structure.<eos> The energy in this cylinder is formulated to break down that enzyme.<eos> It would result in temporary paralysis.<eos> Mr. Tanis says she's harmless.<eos> It is my hope that we only have to use it as a precautionary measure.<eos> Very well.<eos> Proceed.<eos> In your mind, visualize your hand.<eos> Now reach out with that hand and grab the teacup.<eos> Reach out with the fingers of your mind. Grasp it.
It is my hope that we only have to use it as a precautionary measure.<eos> Very well.<eos> Proceed.<eos> In your mind, visualize your hand.<eos> Now reach out with that hand and grab the teacup.<eos> Reach out with the fingers of your mind. Grasp it.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> I can feel the handle and the texture of the metal, but I can't move it.<eos> Don't try to move it.<eos> Just take a drink from it.
Now reach out with that hand and grab the teacup.<eos> Reach out with the fingers of your mind. Grasp it.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> I can feel the handle and the texture of the metal, but I can't move it.<eos> Don't try to move it.<eos> Just take a drink from it.<eos> See?<eos> You can do it.<eos> I don't understand. I didn't try to move it.<eos> No. You just tried to drink from it.
No.<eos> In fact, that is how I appear at present.<eos> I'm shrinking.<eos> A malfunction in my imaging system has been reducing my height.<eos> I've been waiting all day for repairs.<eos> But that is not what I'm calling about.<eos> Nine crew members have reported unusual symptoms - severe headaches, muscle spasms and waves of dizziness.<eos> It could be related to the quantum singularity.<eos> Quantum singularity?<eos> It was sending out strong spatial distortions.
Give me a beer!<eos> Dwarf tossing?<eos> That is weird.<eos> - What can I get ya? - Um...<eos> - I'm lookin' for Jean Colombo.<eos> - She ain't here. I'm her niece, Angela.<eos> Actually, I'm lookin' for my mother, Joanne Scacciapensieri.<eos> - You know her?<eos> - Jean Colombo doesn't own this bar anymore.<eos> She sold it to me. Do you know where she went?
Don't you touch that damn door!<eos> Sorry, kid.<eos> You had to be a cute ass.<eos> Had to stick your dirty little nose in my business, didn't you?<eos> So we should die together.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Off to la-la land.<eos> Sweet dreams.<eos> Want the gun?<eos> -Why you looking at it?
There's no more to tell.<eos> There must be more to tell.<eos> You don't understand yourself.<eos> You're not empty.<eos> What I wouldn't give to be like you, to have your power to have seen the things you have seen.<eos> You haven't been listening.<eos> I have been listening.<eos> Your story is incredible.<eos> -It's amazing.<eos> -Do what you want with it.
Nice try.<eos> You know, there was a time when I wouldn't hurt a fly.<eos> Then the Borg came, and they showed me that if there is one constant in this whole universe, it's death.<eos> Afterwards, I began to realize it didn't really matter.<eos> We're all gonna die sometime.<eos> It's just a question of how and when.<eos> You will, too, Captain.<eos> Aren't you beginning to feel time gaining on you?<eos> It's like a predator. It's stalking you.<eos> You can try and outrun it with doctors, medicines, new technologies, but in the end, time is going to hunt you down and make the kill.
Everything's crossing!<eos> He's fighting my men!<eos> The cerebral programming! Quick, patch it in here!<eos> No!<eos> Now!<eos> Keep movin'!<eos> Let's rock and roll!<eos> Then defeat is a possibility.<eos> Very well.<eos> We shall face it together, Dee Jay,
- Have you got a small screwdriver set?<eos> Tape's jammed in my camera.<eos> Here you go.<eos> How's it going?<eos> I'm numb. I just spent three of the most boring hours of my life at the library.<eos> Three hours?<eos> You know, if you put together all the time I've ever spent in a library, it wouldn't come out to be three hours.<eos> Who would have guessed?<eos> Jill had a speech at the library.<eos> I told her I'd tape it.
Oh, I got it.<eos> - Are you sure it's not another glove?<eos> - No. Here's a real smelly little rat.<eos> - Get the bag.<eos> - No way.<eos> - You get the rat and I'll get the bag.<eos> - l'll get the bag.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - OK, wait a minute.<eos> What am I supposed to do with it?
I just hope this gets us even.<eos> Partner.<eos> Partner?<eos> Yeah. Partner.<eos> - I decided to forgive you.<eos> - Thank you, Lois.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I thought about what you did and realized something.<eos> What's that?<eos> If I'd seen the globe first... I would've taken it and hidden it, and not told a soul, just like you did.
No. Nothing.<eos> Literally nothing.<eos> Do we gotta wait around until these two kids, you know, start a family?<eos> I would've thought there'd be a change as they got back on track.<eos> I'll handle this.<eos> COMPUTER: Game terminal 15 activated.<eos> Maybe things are not on track.<eos> Don't tell me, the last babe on Earth and she's not his type?<eos> No, it's the machine. I mean, look at them.<eos> They're drawn to it like babies to a mother's breast.
We're all giving into it.<eos> Giving into what?<eos> Look at these readings.<eos> They're the same profiles you get from criminal psychopaths.<eos> But I'm finding it in our own crew.<eos> I mean, whatever's infecting the colony's infecting us.<eos> It's making us behave this way. And you haven't found any source of contamination for the colony?<eos> No.<eos> That's what's so frightening.<eos> I mean, look at yourself. Your agitation's what you always hold back, yet you're expressing it blindly.
So you isolated your lab in the deepest canyon you could find.<eos> And made great strides, until my staff started killing each other.<eos> What were you building down there?<eos> A sort of transceiver.<eos> We were trying to beam thoughts of cooperation and nonviolence into the colony.<eos> And in a way, we did.<eos> This machine actually worked?<eos> Yes, though not exactly as planned.<eos> It couldn't beam anything into the colony.<eos> But it was able to draw something away from it.
- You've agreed?<eos> The Bajoran provisional government has agreed to it.<eos> A Cardassian transport will deliver the Bajoran prisoners within five hours.<eos> - You don't know what they'll do!<eos> - We're the ones they're after.<eos> Let Professor Lang go.<eos> The provisional government has ordered you all to be turned over.<eos> I'm fighting this every way I can.<eos> I'm not ready to give up.<eos> But this is a Bajoran station, and I have to abide by their decision, no matter how much I disagree with it.
53 minutes.<eos> Direct sensors toward the wormhole.<eos> Scan for other warp signatures.<eos> One warp signature found.<eos> Display.<eos> Identify.<eos> Starfleet runabout Mekong.<eos> I figured as much.<eos> They'll wait for me to drop out of warp and then...<eos> We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, won't we?
- Yes.<eos> - I need you to help me.<eos> - Help you?<eos> It's not easy for me to take corporeal form.<eos> I can't do it for long.<eos> I want you to light the candle.<eos> Quint said you lived in the candle.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Yes.<eos> If I'm away from it for too long, I begin to weaken.
Too bad his name's no longer Murong, but Liu after my family.<eos> He would've starved to death if I hadn't deigned to save him.<eos> Men have no shame and they're so predictable.<eos> They'II always stay beside you.<eos> They will never stray if you keep them warm and happy.<eos> Qiu Xue, go home.<eos> That man has no heart.<eos> Murong Bai, you're no longer a man. You've become a dog.<eos> I used to play this instrument every night.<eos> I would never sell it for the money I needed.
You do a little heroin? Some beer, hash... something... you feel... just right.<eos> Maybe later.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Come on.<eos> Try some.<eos> It's called chasing the dragon.<eos> The Chinese have been doing it for centuries.<eos> I probably shouldn't, but...<eos> But you must.<eos> If you do it, it will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and you are rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper.
A woman's mutilated dead body has shocked the public.<eos> It was discovered earlier today at the rocky shore.<eos> Police are already investigating.<eos> - In Fumishima?<eos> A mutilated corpse...<eos> Sounds like breakfast for the seagulls.<eos> That is in Izumo area...<eos> The Kagura festive season is close.<eos> The woman seemed to be around 5 feet 3 inch tall.<eos> But her body was badly decomposed and missing it's head.
Yeah.<eos> It's a source of power.<eos> That's it.<eos> Good.<eos> And you gather that power and you direct it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Use it, not your own strength.<eos> That's it.<eos> Good.<eos> Now gather the power that surrounds you and become part of it.
You said you wanted him to be able to defend himself.<eos> STRAMM:<eos> You made me look like an idiot.<eos> EMILY: Stop!<eos> This isn't about you!<eos> STRAMM:<eos> You're damn right it's not.<eos> It's about this family and what is happening.<eos> EMILY:<eos> What is happening to it?
What?<eos> Judgment.<eos> - From me?<eos> - Yes. About what I am, what I do.<eos> I know you don't like it.<eos> I have never given you any such indication.<eos> Well, you haven't had to.<eos> I'm a cop. I carry a gun.<eos> I'm surrounded by violence.<eos> I live with it. I'm a part of it.
I understand.<eos> CAINE:<eos> Good bye, my son.<eos> What are your thoughts, young Caine?<eos> That you will never see your father again?<eos> No, he'll be back.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> If you stay in one place long enough, the world comes to you.<eos> It doesn't have a choice.
Thank you, Hastings.<eos> Hastings, what is the matter with Miss Lemon?<eos> - Miss Lemon? Nothing, as far as I know.<eos> - Come, Hastings. Do not do the shilly-shally with me.<eos> Yourself play with her on the planchette.<eos> - Well, I think it's her cat. You know, the one she used to call Catherine the Great because it liked sleeping in the fireplace.<eos> - That cat, it died, did it not?<eos> - Well, exactly.<eos> She's fearfully cut up about it.<eos> I think she's trying to get in touch with it. - Oh.
- Miss Lemon, Edwin has been arrested.<eos> - Edwin?<eos> - Yes, Monsieur Graves.<eos> - Good.<eos> It's about time.<eos> - Miss Lemon?<eos> - Do you know what he was going to do?<eos> - No.<eos> - He was going to have to move out of Count Foscatini's flat, so he was going to have the Count's cat destroyed.<eos> Couldn't be bothered to find a home for it.
I bring to you a sense of your own worth the worth of one human being.<eos> It was like a blinding light.<eos> I became aware that he was in the room with me.<eos> He wore a dark suit, and on his face I saw a wisdom and pain so old and deep that I could scarcely look at him.<eos> But I knew I wasn't dreaming.<eos> I tell you the most dangerous creation in the world in any society is the man with nothing to lose.<eos> You do not need 10 such men to change the world.<eos> One will do.<eos> The earth belongs to us the black man.<eos> And whatever is around it or on it, or in it belongs to us.
No cancer.<eos> What about the woman you showed me?<eos> Jahausa married outside the tribe.<eos> Kalana is an Exoti.<eos> Then it's genetic.<eos> No, no, no, it's environmental.<eos> The tribes have always intermarried.<eos> But as far as I can tell, the bromeliad doesn't grow anywhere except here.<eos> So the Exoti don't use it.<eos> Kalana still doesn't put it in the food.
Perhaps some sort of nourishment.<eos> The upper portion of the apparatus seems to hold the energy segments.<eos> There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of these fragments inside.<eos> I have resumed the northerly course.<eos> There is no evidence yet of humans.<eos> OK, that's enough, Data.<eos> Come on back now.<eos> I have encountered another life form, an ophidian.<eos> It seems to be restricted by a force field.<eos> Two of the silver-grey entities are approaching it.
Deck 36.<eos> ...and the Dutch and the Portuguese.<eos> It's what all conquerors say.<eos> I'm sure that's what you told that... that... blue-skinned fellow I just saw before you brought him here to serve you.<eos> He's one of the thousands of species that we've encountered.<eos> We live in a peaceful Federation with most of them.<eos> The people you see are here by choice.<eos> So, there are a privileged few who serve on these ships living in luxury and wanting for nothing but what about everybody else?<eos> What about the poor? You ignore them.<eos> Poverty was eliminated on Earth a long time ago and a lot of other things disappeared with it... hopelessness, despair, cruelty...
Tell me where you came from. Point me where you started.<eos> Come on.<eos> Burn indicators distended toward northern wall. Less soot here, more heat.<eos> Lack of discoloration in shattered glass... indicates slow burn before explosion.<eos> There's some little dead rat critters here.<eos> Fire originated in this room.<eos> The air ran out. lt couldn't breathe.<eos> It was snuffed.<eos> But it wasn't dead.<eos> Must have been all that trapped heat lying low, waiting for some sucker to give it one big gulp of air.
You know, once I was... sad, very sad.<eos> What was the reason?<eos> The reason's not important...<eos> Because of my lover.<eos> Mister Frenhofer?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I was your age.<eos> You know what I did?<eos> I took some modelling clay... and made a little figure.<eos> I glued a piece of my fiancé's hair to it... and I started driving needles into his body.
It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> - He's a nice pig, doc.<eos> - It's a she, actually.<eos> Relax, will you?<eos> House calls are probably my favorite part of the job.<eos> Just driving out into the country, seeing what might pop up around the next bend.<eos> Rainbows.<eos> Frost on the kudzu.<eos> John Muir said it, " Most people are on the world, not in it."
Shit!<eos> Shit! Fuck!<eos> (Utah) I gotta be fuckin' crazy!<eos> But are you crazy enough?<eos> Yaaaaaa-hoooooo!<eos> Whooooo-hooooo!<eos> Can't see shit out here.<eos> I'm gonna die.<eos> Feel what the wave is doing, then accept its energy.<eos> Get in sync, then charge with it.
Chancellor, we have a tradition called a "toast".<eos> It is a drink to salute one's friends and good fortune.<eos> And I would like to propose a toast to our new friendship.<eos> We have something like this on Malcor III.<eos> I think we shall find we have much in common.<eos> And much that is not in common.<eos> An opportunity to learn from one another.<eos> You speak the language of diplomacy well.<eos> A language I appreciate and understand.<eos> But I have learned to not always trust it.
I walked over to your house to give it to you,<eos> but I couldn't go in.<eos> I just waited.<eos> I could see you through the window.<eos> I don't know why I couldn't go in.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't.<eos> All that time, you should have been in my home.<eos> In my bed.<eos> It's about the future now, Ed.<eos> And what we're gonna do about it.
I used to swim here every summer.<eos> Two or three times a week.<eos> Then I made a good choice.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I always felt closer to nature than I did to people.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I never had many friends.<eos> Norma was always Miss Popularity.<eos> She was always moving toward the world.<eos> And I was always moving away from it.
Those who dared the journey to the lvory Tower perished.<eos> The very earth is breaking away.<eos> Even us Mudwarts who are made of earth, can't get there.<eos> "The Earthling has come to help us We must talk to the Empress"<eos> Childlike Empress.<eos> Bastian, you are the only Earthling moved by our plight.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are you hurt? The same force that makes the books in your world become empty makes me a prisoner in my castle.<eos> What is this force?<eos> Only you can name it, Bastian.
Merci.<eos> Nice girl.<eos> My dear Poirot, how should I know? That's Miss Buckley's hat, isn't it? Yes.<eos> We're returning it to "End House".<eos> Thus we shall have the opportunity to see again the charming Mlle Nick.<eos> I do believe you've fallen for her! No, no, no.<eos> You are under a misapprehension, mon ami.<eos> The young lady is very charming but I am more interested in her hat.<eos> I don't see why you'd be interested in her hat.<eos> - There's a hole in it!
Hear, hear.<eos> Now's the time for the real ceremony.<eos> Breeze?<eos> I was born with guns.<eos> I grew up with them.<eos> I discovered green grass and trees and clean air later.<eos> So I guess I'm an expert.<eos> On this subject at least.<eos> We need to get rid of everything that pollutes our planet.<eos> So today, we're gonna get rid of another kind of pollution, 'cause it will not do any good to save the Earth, if there's nobody here to enjoy it.
All right.<eos> Once more, let's go over the entire plan and layout.<eos> -I apologize for the crudity of this model...<eos> -Yeah, it's not to scale.<eos> It's okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Tomorrow night, Sunday we load the DeLorean onto the tracks here, on the spur by the abandoned silver mine.<eos> The switch track is where the spur runs off the main line three miles out to Clayton... Shonash Ravine.<eos> The train leaves the station at 8:00 Monday morning.<eos> We'll stop it, uncouple the cars, throw the switch track and then hijack borrow the locomotive and use it to push the time machine.
If it be not to come, it will be now.<eos> If it be not now, yet it will come.<eos> The readiness is all.<eos> All salute!<eos> Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.<eos> Give me your pardon, sir.<eos> I have done you wrong... but pardon it, as you are a gentleman.<eos> Sir, in this audience... free me so far in your most generous thoughts... that I have shot my arrow over the house and hurt my brother.<eos> I am satisfied in nature... but in terms of honor, I stand aloof... and will no reconcilement.<eos> Yet I receive your offered love like love... and will not wrong it.
Who could advance the clock?<eos> Who could give an alibi to his loyal servant, the Tredwell?<eos> Tredwell never liked the mistress, but it is dedicated to a Mr. Waverly.<eos> Be three wrapped ones:<eos> the Waverly, the Tredwell and the niece, to Jessie Withers, what was noisily a farewell, in way to arrange a maneuver of amusement, the Rogers, and then to take the kid of the mausoleum up to a house in the middle of the forest.<eos> It was obvious, Hastings.<eos> We are in London.<eos> Does not it want to come with me?<eos> Hastings, the train has an advantage on the cars.<eos> It is not left without coal.
I want to see the fear and the attraction.<eos> No more.<eos> One hit doesn't make a dancer, Adam.<eos> I made a sensation of you two as Romeo and Juliet.<eos> I can't, Anton.<eos> You finish when I'm finished, or you dance for someone else!<eos> Now, we'll pick it up where we left off.<eos> First the two counts, then turn to one another, and then... let the music lead you.<eos> Give yourself over to it.<eos> Allow it to dictate the steps.
We're coming down.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, live around the world, here she is...<eos> Angelica!<eos> Ryan!<eos> What?<eos> Ryan, she's got the bauble!<eos> What?<eos> She's wearing the bauble!<eos> What the hell is she doing with it?<eos> d Lights down low d We got to get it!
She's been separated from us so that she can... bear the Devil's child, Ryan.<eos> What?<eos> It's his revenge.<eos> It's his final victory over us. There must be some way to stop him.<eos> The ritual operates just like any other curse.<eos> The evil has no power unless you accept it; give yourself to it.<eos> And she thinks she's with a man who's in love with her.<eos> There's something else that you ought to know.<eos> You know that snow globe that Calvin sent to Micki? Yes.<eos> We're inside it.
Oh. You're Hercule Poirot, eh?<eos> Monsieur.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Merci, m-monsieur.<eos> What is it that you wish to consult me about, M. Farley?<eos> I have the same dream, night after night.<eos> I'm sitting in my room next to this, sitting at my desk, writing.<eos> There's a clock in there.<eos> I look up at it. I see the time.
Now, what's it taste like?<eos> - Wet bread. - No.<eos> It's all squishy with gritty bits in it.<eos> That's the sand.<eos> That's the sand.<eos> You're a comic.<eos> No, you mule.<eos> It's got a skin round it.<eos> - Do you spit the skin out?<eos> - No. Pick it out of your teeth afterwards, chump it up.
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting.<eos> From our brother England?<eos> From him, and thus he greets your majesty.<eos> He wills you, in the name of God almighty, that you divest yourself and lay apart... the borrowed glories that by gift of heaven, by law of nature and of nations, belongs to him and to his heirs.<eos> Namely, the crown.<eos> Willing you overlook this pedigree.<eos> And when you find him evenly derived... from his most famed of famous ancestors, Edward the III, he bids you then resign your crown and kingdom, indirectly held from him, the native and true challenger.<eos> Or else what follows?<eos> Bloody constraint.<eos> For if you hide the crown, even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
I hope you've made her see sense.<eos> I don't intend to.<eos> For once a woman can afford her whims.<eos> It's not even a whim, any more.<eos> It's a crime.<eos> I totally agree.<eos> Cheers, Senator.<eos> To our crimes, and to the good they do us.<eos> Well done, I find your idea wonderfully romantic.<eos> Which is exactly what's wrong with it.
It's a good deed.<eos> You doing a good deed?<eos> Wonder of all wonders!<eos> To help escape the man who brought on our misfortune, to free the one who locked us in, isn't that greatness of soul?<eos> Done!<eos> Without any conditions?<eos> Yes, one.<eos> Give and take.<eos> I've always wanted to deflower that wall.<eos> What do you see in it?
Even the Punisher has to live somewhere.<eos> Hey.<eos> - You see this board here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've been living with it for five years.<eos> Every time he kills somebody... I put a pin in it.<eos> I fine-tooth every building, every alley, in this city.<eos> The only thing that I've got to show for it... is these little calling cards here... and a whole bunch of these.<eos> I've already been through this city.<eos> I've been in it, around it, on top of it.
- 32.50.<eos> - It's a nice dress.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I thought so, too.<eos> - Looks like a tablecloth.<eos> Keep the change.<eos> And, Ann, don't worry about the dress.<eos> I'm sure she'll like it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think it'll...
She's been very sweet.<eos> We'd appreciate it.<eos> Yes, I'll do that.<eos> Listen, I am gonna have to ask a couple of questions to kind of update this file.<eos> It says that the doctors are considering another bone marrow transplant.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Do you think you'll go ahead with that?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> We haven't decided yet.<eos> They don't give it much of a chance.
What would you call it then?<eos> A disease.<eos> A vicious disease that very, very rarely strikes kids your age.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I'm so scared.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I know, kiddo.<eos> But don't you see?<eos> That's why it's so important to talk about it.<eos> Just bring that fear out in the open so you can deal with it.
Mankind is in the habit of creating its own monsters, and fortunately, once in a while, it also gets the chance to destroy them.
- It is obvious.<eos> Why is that correct?<eos> Isn't this a game of misdirection?<eos> - Not now. He wants us to find him.<eos> - Who does?<eos> The master criminal, the man Holmes could only defeat at the cost of his own life at Reichenbach Falls.<eos> Our adversary, my dear Watson, is none other than Professor Moriarty himself.<eos> Now this is getting interesting.<eos> There's nothing here but barrels.<eos> And a trail, which is so well marked, that obviously we are meant to follow it.
If you look into yourself, you are not blind.<eos> That is why you're here with us, running away.<eos> Yes<eos> You are dying, brother.<eos> After all, there is truth in everything I say if I'm capable of expressing it.<eos> Freedom is... is lying in darkness.<eos> It turns away it turns away from the lust of darkness, to lean towards the lust of light.<eos> It embraces light with it's everlasting will.<eos> And darkness strives to capture the light of freedom.<eos> But it cannot do that. Because it is centered on it's own lust and turns to darkness again.
Merry Christmas, sir.<eos> -Merry Christmas, Fairchild.<eos> -Merry Christmas, madam.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> -Sir, would you care to smell my rose?<eos> -Of course.<eos> LINDA:<eos> Fairchild!<eos> Fairchild, you did well.<eos> She likes it.
When you looked at me yesterday, I realized something.<eos> I realized that, between you and a world forever out of reach, there is a strange and empty tunnel.<eos> I don't know anyone else who knows that road.<eos> You're standing alone at the entrance to the tunnel because you know something I can't even put a name on, something deeper and more ruthless than I can ever understand.<eos> I realize that I can never get closer to that world.<eos> I can only long for it, because it is hidden by a light and warmth that I cannot bear.<eos> I have been able neither to believe in it nor to renounce it.<eos> Yesterday I realized I had made a fatal mistake.<eos> If I were to lose you, it would be the unforgivable end of me, because I know nothing about that unnameable world.<eos> Since you are part of it, you mean the world to me.
Willow?<eos> Oh. [Yawning] There you are.<eos> Madmartigan!<eos> [Yawning] Night, Willow.<eos> [Birds Squawking]<eos> [Rool] This way!<eos> This way!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I found some black root.<eos> She loves it!
Something wrong?<eos> Lloyd came by to see you.<eos> You came back?<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Now, Lloyd, please try and keep an open mind.<eos> I didn't believe it myself at first.<eos> Believe what?<eos> We keep them in here.<eos> What did you find out?<eos> As near as I can figure it, the mulcher is somehow producing currency for every person killed in it.
Just say no.<eos> It's as simple as that.<eos> From now on, just say no.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't disappoint us again.<eos> And at 8:00 in the morning, the 14-year-old girl turned in her stepfather for using cocaine.<eos> Police confiscated several grams of the drug, and the youth authorities say that Rita and her mother and stepfather will be joining a family counselling programme this week.<eos> Rita's story isn't the first drug-related news item this reporter's filed this year.<eos> Nor, unfortunately, will it be the last.<eos> Both you and I know that the drug menace has invaded every level of society, contaminating everything it touches.
That must be Robin Leach.<eos> Can I get some help here?<eos> Well, here it is.<eos> But please be very careful with our luggage.<eos> We just got it.<eos> We'll treat it as if it were our own.<eos> Then I can't let you have it.<eos> Hey, she brought the camera.<eos> Oh, now, Steve loves this camera.<eos> Please be very careful with it.
Ar Mo!<eos> Ar Mo!<eos> This is the detention center... of the Fushun Bureau of Public Security. And I am the governor.<eos> During the war, this was a Japanese prison.<eos> Many of you may remember it... because you worked with the Japanese. You were responsible for building it... and you filled it with innocent people.<eos> How could this happen?<eos> Why did you betray your country?<eos> What turned you into war criminals?<eos> We believe that men are born good.<eos> We believe that the only way to change is to discover the truth and look at it in the face.
Hey, Mike.<eos> Out of the bag, into the bureau.<eos> How do you like it so far?<eos> God, have I got a hangover.<eos> Youever hear the chatter?<eos> They're worse than fucking four-year-olds.<eos> Let's find out what we know.<eos> Check them out.<eos> Anybody knows more than gossip, I want to talk to them personally.<eos> Keegan, take the witness downtown and babysit it.
Ellen.<eos> Please, Ellen!<eos> I'm afraid she's not herself.<eos> She's been at my recent trial, plus our approaching marriage...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Doctor, please take care of our guests.<eos> - Yes.<eos> The renowned Walker has prepared a statement in the form of a quote from President Buchanan:<eos> "Expansion is the future of our country.<eos> Only cowards fear and oppose it".
Nobody ever gave me a chance to do a real job.<eos> Like a man.<eos> If my dad could see he'd be surprised.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure he would.<eos> These are good bones for the dog.<eos> Can I take him some?<eos> Sure, why don't you take them all?<eos> Yeah, he'll be happy.<eos> The world could sure use a few more like Arnie.<eos> Hey, if it would just use the ones it's got.
Nancy.<eos> Okay, plot me a course.<eos> Super Pursuit Mode.<eos> The warehouse is at the end of this street, Michael.<eos> Okay, back to cruise.<eos> As I said, all in the spirit of research, Mr. Miles.<eos> You see, in this escape... the audience must believe that I'm drowning.<eos> After watching you die... my performance will be frighteningly authentic.<eos> Austin, I don't like this. Let's get it over with, quickly.<eos> It's one thing to order an execution... quite another to witness it, isn't it, Ian?
- Most of us are adults here.<eos> Can't we talk about-- ?<eos> No! Don't hit.<eos> Just calm down. Take it easy.<eos> AII right, look, if this is the way it's gotta be, at Ieast let me get rid of my jacket, huh?<eos> It's my favourite. I don't wanna see it ruined.<eos> It's your favourite jacket, huh?<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> That darned jacket's always tripping people up like that.<eos> I've been meaning to have a talk with it.
Billy.<eos> Billy, what is "it"?<eos> - You're it.<eos> - I don't do speeches, you know that.<eos> You'll manage.<eos> Check Sawaski's office. He's probably got notes somewhere.<eos> Notes?<eos> Wait, hold on a second. Notes?<eos> Guy has given the same speech every other Monday for the past two decades.<eos> I heard it myself 10 years ago, until I dozed off.
No.<eos> He will look in the wrong places.<eos> But what if he should learn it of his own accord?<eos> You overestimate his talents, my lord abbot.<eos> There is only one authority capable of investigating such matters.<eos> The Holy Inquisition.<eos> What is your opinion, Venerable Jorge?<eos> Dear brethren I leave such worldly matters to younger men.<eos> Adso.<eos> - In order to command nature one must first learn to obey it.
Drop dead.<eos> I'll put it out when I'm finished.<eos> You'll put it out now, mister!<eos> Hit it!<eos> Now, go get him!<eos> -Hurry up!<eos> -I'm trying. I'm going as fast--<eos> Drive!<eos> Will this count against us, sir?<eos> I've been here at the academy many wonderful years... and I'm very fond of it.
Because Julian Bradley is guilty.<eos> But not of the attempted murder of Rachel McCulloch.<eos> That was an accident, pure and simple.<eos> And if Julian Bradley didn't look the way he looks, and if the medieval legends about him hadn't sprung up in this town, he wouldn't be on trial here today at all.<eos> If all of you were as blind as Rachel McCulloch, if you couldn't see his face, but just the man, this talk of monsters would be absurd.<eos> But he is guilty of one thing.<eos> He is guilty of attempting to destroy something that is very precious.<eos> Love.<eos> It was offered to him, pure and innocent and true, and he ran away from it.<eos> He ran away from it because he couldn't bring himself to trust it, or the girl who was offering that love.
Uh, n-no. I - I already told you.<eos> His secretary called me about 9:30.<eos> She said she went home at 6:00... and her time card backs her up.<eos> - Somebody called me.<eos> - It doesn't look good, Max. - Oh.<eos> Uh, if you think that looks bad- - Mm-hmm?<eos> wait till you hear this.<eos> The... murder weapon-<eos> - What about it?<eos> - Uh, well, it, uh- uh, just may have my fingerprints on it.
We can continue later if you're too tired.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> I just didn't hear your question.<eos> Who did you receive your instructions from?<eos> My conscience.<eos> I know a few things about predatory behaviour.<eos> What was once a legitimate intelligence-gathering agency is now being misused to prey on weaker governments.<eos> We ran out.<eos> I appreciate fear.<eos> The chance to face it.
Poor, dumb creatures with no memory of the half-life of their human existence.<eos> Never touching in the flesh.<eos> Only the anguish of a split second at sunrise and sunset when they can almost touch,<eos> but not.<eos> Always together.<eos> Eternally apart.<eos> As long as the sun rises and sets, as long as there is day and night.<eos> And for as long as they both shall live.<eos> You have stumbled onto a tragic story, Phillipe Gaston.<eos> And now, whether you like it or not, you are lost in it, with the rest of us.
If I can get across to the city.<eos> What about the male?<eos> He'll come if he senses I've found her.<eos> She's drawing me, Caine.<eos> Carlsen.<eos> I've got to go.<eos> Why?<eos> She wants back the energy she gave me.<eos> When they take on a new life-form, they have to learn from that life-form.<eos> Mate with it, in a sense.
- We've no time to get it.<eos> I've had it since boyhood.<eos> What shall we do?<eos> Kurogane said they'll pursue you.<eos> I'll go back for the flute.<eos> Your legs are old. I'm the one to go.<eos> We're near the ruins of your castle. Go there and pray for your dead.<eos> You may never be back again.<eos> Tsurumaru, let's hurry!<eos> I see our castle. That is, what's left of it.
It won't be easy, you know.<eos> I've only got one good hand.<eos> Garth!<eos> To my midnight star.<eos> Cobb's using me to stop you.<eos> So good people are being hurt because of me.<eos> That makes me mad.<eos> Some people think because they're stronger they can push you around.<eos> I've seen a lot of that, but it's only true if you let it be.<eos> The world is what you make of it.
Like you've never been to the Bronx.<eos> No. Can't say that I have.<eos> Cat, listen.<eos> Just the cactus sucking wind.<eos> Cat, there's somebody out there.<eos> I know it.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Come on, get in. Let's go.<eos> I'm not going to lose this ranch, Cat.<eos> I've got too many plans for it.
- This O'Flynn, did I know him? - Huh?<eos> - This O'Flynn, did I know-<eos> - You see, Mr. Steele is suffering from amnesia.<eos> Oh, dear, that must be an unforgettable experience.<eos> So, if you could just tell me what I was doing here.<eos> Well, sure. Wasn't it- Wasn't it about the watch?<eos> Uh, you mean, uh, this one? This watch?<eos> Aye, that's it.<eos> That's what brought you here.<eos> That and the letter that went with it. - The letter?
- The apartment manager's not in.<eos> - Call her.<eos> - I just called her.<eos> - Call her again.<eos> Give me a cigarette.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Fooled you.<eos> You're talking to a machine.<eos> But don't be shy.<eos> It's OK. Machines need love, too, so talk to it...
All lines are busy.<eos> Ifyou need a police car sent out to you, stay on the line.<eos> Go on.<eos> I'm gonna make a belt out of you.<eos> Don't make me bust you up, man.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Fooled you.<eos> You're talking to a machine.<eos> But don't be shy.<eos> It's OK. Machines need love, too. So talk to it and Ginger, that's me, or Sarah will get back to you.
What's our tie-in with this, uh, Philip Royce?<eos> Royce called two days ago.<eos> He wanted the Foundation's help on a story he was researching.<eos> - What kind of help?<eos> - We weren't able to find out.<eos> However, I got the impression from the telephone call that the story was an expose.<eos> If you're right about that, all we gotta do is find out who he was trying to expose... and we've got our prime suspect.<eos> Correct.<eos> - Does the story have a title?<eos> - He referred to it by a code name...
But don't you feel such shows contribute... to a social climate of violence and sexual malaise?<eos> - And do you care?<eos> - Certainly, I care.<eos> I care enough, in fact, to give my viewers a... A harmless outlet for their fantasies and their frustrations.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, that's a socially positive act.<eos> What about it, Nicki?<eos> Is it socially positive?<eos> Well, I think we live in overstimulated times.<eos> We crave stimulation for its own sake.<eos> We gorge ourselves on it.
That's what we were hoping you'd tell us.<eos> - Did you think of something?<eos> - Kind of. I'm hungry.<eos> Don't worry, Micki.<eos> We'll help you remember.<eos> Now, did you take a purse with you to the party?<eos> Yeah. I mean, well...<eos> Well, I-I guess so.<eos> Don't you think? Maybe I dropped it.<eos> I'll tell you what. I'll go down to the beach and look for it, huh?
And tomorrow, it'll be easier and the day after that, even easier still.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Oh, dear God, I hope so.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, Miss Rose.<eos> Good morning, Corabeth.<eos> Mr. Perkins, you are to be commended.<eos> Because of your ad, we have already sold four of those weenie roasters.<eos> Well, that advertisement's only been running for a day.<eos> Give it some time to saturate the market.
BEN:<eos> Not me, lady.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> You, Virginia, and me.<eos> That's good.<eos> Cindy.<eos> I want more than anything to go home but I want you to understand something.<eos> - I don't want to stay.<eos> - Not stay?<eos> I've seen a new world and I want us to be a part of it.
What's wrong with lumber?<eos> I own two lumber yards.<eos> I notice you don't spend much time there.<eos> I'm not sure where they are.<eos> I like you, Betty.<eos> That's Danny, sir.<eos> Danny.<eos> I'm going to give you a little advice.<eos> There's a force in the universe that makes things happen.<eos> All you have to do is get in touch with it.
Day and night, for seven days, the country's population rang bells, banged saucepan lids and shouted.<eos> The sparrows, frightened to settle, eventually fell dead out of the sky.<eos> Flight exhaustion from the same cause also killed gulls on the coast, herons in the marsh, eagles in the mountains and pigeons on the town square.<eos> On the seventh day, Sparrow Week ended.<eos> Next year two-thirds of the country's food supply was eaten by insects and the money standard changed from gold to eggs.<eos> Were you speaking metaphorically when you said you were preparing to lay your own golden egg?<eos> Can I take it that...<eos> The compilation of the biography of a living person is a sensitive matter.<eos> Where necessary, and in nearly every case where the subject wanted it, various forms of anonymity were used.<eos> The VUE Commission offered a choice of ten pseudonymous identities and Squaline Fallaize, the subject of biography 10, chose identity 10 for she recognised it for another bird victim.
"Uncovers Aphrodite fragment from 5th century BC, stop."<eos> - "Fraternally yours, Lemercier."<eos> - I'm overwhelmed... thank you!<eos> If this doesn't do it you'll never get any academic accolades.<eos> Tell me, sweetie pie... Wouldn't that be a good idea?<eos> Why?<eos> If you declare the statue it can never be sold.<eos> Sell Aphrodite?<eos> ! Never!<eos> - So what do you want to do with it?
It was like a miracle to young Zannowich. Everywhere, people flocked to him.<eos> He had the key to everyone's heart.<eos> Fool!<eos> You should repent, acknowledge what has happened, see what needs to be done,<eos> Now, I want to ask you how Zannowich got as far as he did.<eos> Father and son, for that matter.<eos> Because they had brains, they were clever, you think.<eos> Other people have been clever too, but they haven't achieved as much at 80 as Stefan at 20.<eos> What's most important are a person's eyes and his feet.<eos> You have to be able to see the world and go toward it.
People are always cheerful here.<eos> That'll be another 60 pfennigs.<eos> Come on, big guy.<eos> Trouble with the eyes?<eos> Drink Mampe's brandy and you'll feel fine and dandy.<eos> And I've got something here. Read that and everything will be okay again.<eos> "Sexual potency is the outcome of the combined actions of first, the internal secretory system, second, the nervous system, and third, the sexual apparatus.<eos> The glands responsible for potency are:<eos> the pituitary gland, the thyroid gland, the adrenal glands, the prostate gland, the seminal vesicle and the epididymis.<eos> Within this system, the gonad predominates. The substance it produces charges the entire sexual apparatus, from the cerebral cortex to the genitals. The erotic stimulus triggers erotic tension in the cerebral cortex.
And we never know we have been flipped, let alone know how.<eos> Man, I got a rush listening to him.<eos> That man speaks the truth.<eos> Gerome, he may speak the truth but from a place of insanity.<eos> He's gone insane.<eos> No, man, he is the only one who understands, right.<eos> I mean, they flipped the switch on him but he fought through.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> A truck has no conscience.<eos> Itjust does what the driver wants it to do.
All her previous memories were removed and stored on the data crystal.<eos> If you take me to her, I'll explain the rest.<eos> Chief, are you all right?<eos> The data crystal... where is it?<eos> Forget about the crystal... we've got to find Arissa.<eos> That crystal is Arissa.<eos> She took the crystal.<eos> I don't know where she went.<eos> It generates a distinctive signal.<eos> We might be able to track it.
What clues?<eos> Well, for one thing he was a lot easier to get along with.<eos> So, I suppose this means you want your Klingon opera collection back.<eos> Intact.<eos> More or less.<eos> Then it's settled. In light of the new treaty and the continued Dominion threat to the Alpha Quadrant there will be a permanent Klingon military presence on this station.<eos> But I choose the Commander.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Mr. Worf thinks very highly of you, General. I think very highly of him.<eos> Then I can't think of a better man for the job if you'll take it.
Don't worry.<eos> You're going to get through this all right.<eos> Oh, no... no, no.<eos> I'm just an observer here.<eos> Odo, the changeling won't respond to anything less than six millivolts.<eos> There must be some other way.<eos> Spare the rod, spoil the child.<eos> Odo, without discomfort the changeling will be perfectly comfortable to remain in its gelatinous state.<eos> It'll just lie there... never realizing it has the ability to mimic other forms... never living up to its potential.<eos> Odo, six millivolts is not going to hurt it.
Wait a minute.<eos> I had to try that three times before you caught on.<eos> Actually, the first two times I didn't hold my shape on purpose.<eos> You're not serious.<eos> I suppose I didn't want to give you the satisfaction.<eos> Well, someday, if you're very lucky... this changeling... will give you the satisfaction of saying<eos> "Thank you very much.<eos> You did so much for me."<eos> Then again... it may leave... the way you did.<eos> It will announce that it's striking out on its own and you will never... hear from it again.
- When he rose up the eyes are incredible.<eos> ...for a minute there<eos> I thought he was going to say something.<eos> Oh, put that down.<eos> We're celebrating.<eos> Oh, uh, it's just that I've fallen behind in my security reports over these last few days.<eos> Well, you can catch up later. Aren't you excited by what happened?<eos> Of course, I'm excited.<eos> You know, tomorrow, we can expose the changeling to some simple life-forms so it can mimic them... some algae, some fungus. In a few more days, maybe even an invertebrate.<eos> I can't wait until I can actually communicate with it.

When we disregard the last one as point of origin, that leaves three to work with.<eos> Captain Carter's computer model has thus far extrapolated only one set of symbols from the Abydos cartouche that contains these three glyphs.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> That's where we're going.<eos> - Very good, Colonel.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> I pride myself on my deductive reasoning skills.<eos> In one hour, you will go through the gate to the planet these symbols represent.<eos> It has been designated P3X-797.<eos> Couldn't we call it something that's easier to remember?
You don't seem to be.<eos> Mom...<eos> Several months ago, I learned that, as a result of my abduction, of what they did to me, that I cannot conceive a child.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's OK.<eos> I just never realised how much I wanted it until I couldn't have it.<eos> - Dana, where is it?<eos> Where is that rabbit?<eos> - I'm not telling.<eos> I'm gonna find that rabbit and cook it. Turn it into stew.
He used the subterranean access to breach the Pentagon.<eos> - Are you sure it's him?<eos> - I can't ascertain that.<eos> - Do you want me to apprehend him?<eos> - Don't do or say anything.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> (Scully) If my work with Agent Mulder has tested the foundation of my beliefs, science has been, and continues to be, my guiding light.<eos> Now I am again relying on its familiar and systematic methods to arrive at a truth, a fact that might explain the fate that has befallen me.<eos> An investigation that began without, now turning within.<eos> Taking cellular material from the unidentizled life form and isolating a virus contained within it, then matching the DNA from this virus against that which I believe has caused my cancer;
Is he circumcised?<eos> Can you imagine what his anus looks like?<eos> Describe it to me.<eos> Would you like to sodomize him?<eos> Would you like to put your penis right into his anus? Just thrust it up his anus?<eos> Tell me. Describe it to me.<eos> Tell me what you would do.<eos> How could you just kiss him in that car?<eos> Describe how you'd reach over... and unzip his greasy jeans... take out his penis.<eos> Would you kiss it or suck it right away?
Well, look, the king let Thomas go and Thomas spent the rest of his happy life sacrificing for others.<eos> - So Thomas conned the king, right?<eos> - No.<eos> No, the king was not conned.<eos> The king had faith. He believed.<eos> See, that's where I get confused.<eos> That's good.<eos> Confusion is good.<eos> Faith isn't arrived at easily.<eos> It's the struggle that gives it its power and its meaning.
Shawn, the Cybercycles.<eos> Harvey, put in the Cybercycle disc...<eos> Harvey, can you hear me?<eos> Put in the Cybercycle disc now!<eos> No one jacks-out until we find who is doing this!<eos> You are alive! How can that be?<eos> There isn't time, Peter.<eos> Need your help. I am diyng.<eos> What do you mean dying?<eos> The Cyberspace is dying and so am I right along with it...
The body lay undiscovered for more than a week.<eos> There was a crucifix and a picture of St. Jude in his pocket.<eos> He was 29 years old.<eos> Michael Sullivan lives in a small town in the English countryside, where he works part-time as a carpenter.<eos> He no longer practices law, and he has never married.<eos> He lives quietly and alone.<eos> Carol still works for a social service agency and lives in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> She has never married, but is a single mother supporting a growing 12-year-old son.<eos> The boy, John Thomas Michael Martinez, loves to read and is called Shakes by his mother.<eos> It was our special night, and we held it for as long as we could.
- Does your wine have a smoky taste?<eos> No, it has an earthy taste, like all the wine around here.<eos> You know that it's because of the woodlouse?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> There's a plague.<eos> But does it also have, very faintly a kind of frosty taste?<eos> A taste of cold, dry air?<eos> No, but I'll pour you a glass and you can try it.<eos> Angela...<eos> Do you know why the woodlouse gives it that taste?
- Heil!<eos> - Sieg...<eos> Kehrt!<eos> We're most proud to add you to our ranks. Welcome, Lothar.<eos> It's the famous Krupp 88.<eos> It's almost a shame that there are no planes to fire them at.<eos> Fire.<eos> A tank is deaf and half-blind. You can hear it, but it can't hear you.<eos> It's hard for you to see it all because of the way it jolts up and down.<eos> Also, it has big blind spots here and here, and it's almost totally blind when you're right up close to it.
I was determined to cure him of the bad habits his father had taught him.<eos> Where were we?<eos> Right.<eos> "Dear me, come into the light and let me have a look at you.<eos> "So they all went into the house, and then they put..."<eos> Remember his name?<eos> -Hop O' My...<eos> -Hop O' My...<eos> "Hop O' My Thumb "on the table.<eos> "It was such a big table.
War is as much concept as execution.<eos> What else did they teach you?<eos> Delight.<eos> Respect.<eos> Compassion.<eos> That for your actions to be pure, they must proceed from direction, determination, patience and strength.<eos> I'm afraid I'm still working on patience.<eos> They taught me how to live how to breathe, how to fight and how to die.<eos> And they taught me terror.<eos> How to use it.

Delenn?<eos> Where are you?<eos> He's here, isn't he?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then it's time.<eos> We are Grey.<eos> We stand between the candle and the star.<eos> He's my friend, Lennier.<eos> I know.<eos> But it must be done or the dream will die, and countless others will die with it.
I want you, Drake.<eos> I know you do.<eos> But we can never be together that way.<eos> What?<eos> There's something I never told you.<eos> I'm actually your half-brother.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> I get the medical award for separating the Siamese twins.<eos> Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramon where I find the world's biggest emerald.<eos> But it's cursed.
We're at a gas station waiting for an ambulance.<eos> We're not gonna make it.<eos> - That first takes forever to be born.<eos> - [moans] Oh, my God!<eos> That's it.<eos> This baby is coming.<eos> It's coming?<eos> The ambulance isn't here.<eos> You're the mother.<eos> - Tell it to stop.
They should be near the door.<eos> I didn't really feel them fly too far off.<eos> Here they are.<eos> - He's feeling more confident.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> He killed the woman where he disposed of the body.<eos> No.<eos> Security guard reported nothing out of the ordinary.<eos> Crime scene team found no evidence the murder occurred here.<eos> The blood splatter patterns are moving away from the scene, not arriving at it.
No one could leave, and it made us turn on each other.<eos> Did it kill Eedo Bolow?<eos> Yes.<eos> Because he was weak.<eos> Because he'd lost his discipline.<eos> Just like the others did.<eos> Just like I did.<eos> Once you've lost your faith and discipline, it will devour you.<eos> Nothing can save you from it.<eos> You can't save me from it.
Where are you going?<eos> Anywhere but here!<eos> I'll get my things in the morning.<eos> I'll pack them for you.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> You couldn't fold a shirt if your life depended on it.<eos> What's that over there?<eos> It's just another stone.<eos> I can't believe it. I've been walking for three days and I haven't seen a single beetle.<eos> I could really go for a beetle right now... any kind of beetle just as long as it had a little meat on it.
Dreadnought... Humanoid life support aboard this vessel has been terminated.<eos> Approaching target at full impulse.<eos> Stage one alert has been activated. Initiating final detonation sequence.<eos> People are crowding every port trying to get off the eastern continent.<eos> There aren't enough ships.<eos> Kellan, there are still 41 minutes for us to prevent this.<eos> What can be done in 41 minutes?<eos> I'm prepared to use this ship to detonate the warhead before the missile reaches you.<eos> Use your ship?<eos> To collide with it?
Let the local authorities investigate that.<eos> Those defects are autosomal-dominant disorders.<eos> And from the degree, I'd say mutations that go back many generations.<eos> Scully, Sheriff Taylor implied that the boys in that family... _.were not the type that could easily get dates.<eos> But he also implied that they practise inbreeding.<eos> Now, we all have a natural instinct to propagate.<eos> Do we?<eos> There are theories which pose that our bodies... _.are simply vehicles for genes needing to replicate.<eos> Yeah, but there's no sister, the mother's been dead for ten years...<eos> But if the instinct and need is strong enough, they will answer it any way they can.
This is the past.<eos> It's empty.<eos> It's silent.<eos> It's a world with all the meaning of a discarded old paint can.<eos> Sensory input has disappeared.<eos> Electricity has already disappeared.<eos> And time itself is winding down in a kind of a spiral that's going faster and faster.<eos> But what about us?<eos> If this place is winding down and we're caught in it...<eos> I suppose we'll wind down with it.
It's not one of these?<eos> Do you see a black leather jacket like Pacino's in Serpico?<eos> If you don't, you owe me $379.<eos> But the sign...<eos> I didn't come to Florida to freeze!<eos> You either find my coat or give me the $379 my ex-wife paid for it.<eos> Puoi spiegare che Signor Barboni ha prestato...<eos> Wait, Ray Bones took my coat?<eos> He borrow it.<eos> Somebody took his coat so he tried this other coat and it fit good.
There's more offense in that than in reputation.<eos> What, man! There are ways to recover the general again.<eos> You are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice.<eos> Sue to him again, and he's yours.<eos> I would rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken and so indiscreet an officer.<eos> He that you followed what had he done to you?<eos> - I know not.<eos> Is it possible?<eos> Drunk!<eos> Wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.
The compass.<eos> The spinning arrow.<eos> It's the arrow from your dream!<eos> I was right.<eos> It was pointing to him!<eos> - Sunrise.<eos> - It's not too late, child!<eos> Let the spirits of the earth guide you!<eos> You know your path, child.<eos> Now follow it!
My mother's counsel I know well<eos> and her arts I prize and welcome:<eos> vengeance for treachery, peace for the heart in anguish!<eos> Bring that casket here to me!<eos> It holds the balm you need.<eos> Thus did your mother arrange the mighty magic potions:<eos> balsam here for woe and wounds, antidotes for deadly poisons.<eos> The noblest draught I hold here!<eos> You are mistaken, I know one better:<eos> I engraved a private sign on it.
- Morning.<eos> I see you're still clutching that award.<eos> I didn't realize I had it with me.<eos> You took it in the shower this morning.<eos> It took me a long time to get this.<eos> This means a lot to me.<eos> I know, honey.<eos> And I think it's real cute.<eos> I just hope that we don't have to sleep with it again tonight.<eos> No. I'm gonna make it a little bed.
Sounds like an ancient Chinese cause of nausea.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, Tim.<eos> It makes a very delightful bee tea.<eos> The best part is, you don't have to add honey. (chuckles)<eos> Maybe I should whip some up for Jill.<eos> She doesn't think I take care of her very well.<eos> Well, Tim, it's not uncommon for men to have difficulty being nurturers.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> When I was seven years old, a little sparrow fell out of a tree in our backyard.<eos> I tried to make it feel better. I stroked its little head for four hours, you know.
It's our fault, it's our fault.<eos> If we hadn't come...<eos> Here.<eos> Cordrazine.<eos> This is a stimulant.<eos> You can't pump it full of drugs without knowing its body chemistry.<eos> So we should just let it die?<eos> Give me that.<eos> When I was a kid, a baby bird fell out of a nest and landed on the windowsill next to my bed.<eos> We had to feed it water with an eyedropper to keep it alive.
Are you Jensen? Maybe.<eos> Hook sent me.<eos> Hook? Why?<eos> He said you owed him one. Maybe I do.<eos> What does he want? The code to the archives.<eos> Sorry, no can do.<eos> Only Mrs Kågård has it and she´s integrity incarnate.<eos> You once told me there was a way of getting into the archives.<eos> Yes, but I don´t know the code.<eos> Only Mrs. Kågård has it and she´s integrity incarnate.
Yes.<eos> Without guardian... fail-safe... destroy itself.<eos> If it blows, it'll kill everyone here.<eos> Is there any way to stop it?<eos> - What's your prognosis?<eos> - He's dying.<eos> He's been dying for a while.<eos> That explains the seismic disturbances.<eos> The more he suffered, the more the system failed.<eos> But without him, the planet is dying... and taking us right along with it.
It'll find you!<eos> Brother Garibaldi, I was looking for you.<eos> Let's take a walk, huh?<eos> - You're making the natives restless.<eos> - I'm not crazy.<eos> It's on this station.<eos> What is?<eos> Death.<eos> It came off that ship from the past.<eos> I followed it.
Forgive him, Mama.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> I've made your papa lose face.<eos> If you ever do that to a husband I'll have both your cheeks glowing, one from him and one from me.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Who's first?<eos> You talk now or it's bye-bye, Charlie!<eos> You dig, asshole?<eos> All right, it's your ass!<eos> Kiss it good-bye.
He's coming here?<eos> That's right.<eos> Tell all your little friends.<eos> - Wow!<eos> Gene, that couldn't really happen... could it?<eos> .. With the ant?<eos> In fact, it has happened.<eos> Up in Tennessee, about a year ago.<eos> This poor bastard got trapped in a uranium mine with a click beetle.<eos> He combined with it.
It says, "In order to pronounce the letter V without moving your lips, make a gentle cough, followed by a soft G."<eos> Uh, try to say, "Hi, Aunt Vivian."<eos> Hi, Aunt...<eos> G-i... ian.<eos> Very good.<eos> See, Mom, I can't do this.<eos> Besides, I feel like an idiot talking to a hanger.<eos> You shouldn't think of it as a hanger.<eos> You should think of it as a real living person.<eos> - We should give it a name.
You will be paying for the champagne, won't you?<eos> For everyone?<eos> - Yes, I will.<eos> - Very good of you.<eos> Do enjoy your evening.<eos> That was quite a trick.<eos> It was not a trick.<eos> You must embrace the pain.<eos> Make it part of yourself.<eos> Become one with it.
There will be no more punishment on board this ship.<eos> Do your duties, and I'll see to it that we complete our mission and get our payment.<eos> - Remove that.<eos> - Orders?<eos> Maintain our present course and speed for now.<eos> I'll find out when and where we're supposed to deliver our cargo.<eos> Aye, Captain.<eos> Worf to Cmdr Riker.<eos> Minister Satok of Vulcan Security is standing by on a secure channel.<eos> Put it through in here.
We have to find some way of staying unfrozen.<eos> Mr. La Forge, what about a subspace force field, like the one we used on Devidia II?<eos> Could something like that protect us from the temporal fragment?<eos> Possibly.<eos> We need an awfully sensitive phase discriminator.<eos> The emergency transporter armbands contain a type-seven discriminator.<eos> It should be possible to reconfigure their emitters.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That would isolate us from the other time frame.<eos> But to interact with it, we have to restrict the field.
Mr. Simpson, Gary spilled his ear medicine.<eos> Oh, those baby ducks were so cute.<eos> I can't believe they let us walk right up and feed them.<eos> - I need to go to the bathroom. - We stopped five minutes ago.<eos> Someone knocked on the door, and I couldn't go.<eos> I'm telling you. A big, crazy prank is just what the doctor ordered.<eos> The dean will go nuts.<eos> I got it!<eos> We wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside... we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge!<eos> So it's a prank you're looking for, is it?
It's like a normal injection but on a slightly larger scale of course.<eos> Frankly, sir, I have kids myself and that just doesn't seem like the type...<eos> Well naturally, Captain.<eos> This is just a... a last resort.<eos> I'm Bradley Swallow, reporting live from the famous Glitter Gulch where certainly the biggest story of the year is unfolding.<eos> Casino owners are understandably upset. They've been ordered to evacuate... The answers to our questions lie with two key players in this drama:<eos> Stop the clapping.<eos> I've got a plan.<eos> Great. 'Cause I'm starting to get airsick.<eos> We'll pull the thread out of the bottom of the pocket and use it as a rope to slide down.
Your transcripts are also fakes.<eos> Clever fakes, but fakes.<eos> Anything to say?<eos> -You're mistaken.<eos> -Oh, no, I'm not.<eos> But you are, Charles, if you think you can wiggle out of this.<eos> I don't know who you are, but I know you're not who you say you are.<eos> If this is blackmail, Mr. Fallows, I think you've picked the wrong guy.<eos> This car is the only expensive thing I've got.<eos> I'm sentimental about it.
Look, Turtle Face, you've finally found a Mistress who looks good in an art deco dress.<eos> Greet your Mistress.<eos> Dear Mistress Ai.<eos> Train me good and hard.<eos> And what's your first request, Turtle Face?<eos> I'd like to kiss her feet.<eos> Kiss her feet?<eos> Yes.<eos> What do you think of his capricious wish, Ai?<eos> Will you grant it?
Hey, Ray.<eos> Your wife get you that hat?<eos> Something wrong with it?<eos> Nothing that pissing on it won't cure.
I must.<eos> The king is returning from the bath;<eos> the sun stands high.<eos> Now let me lead you to our hallowed feast; for if you are pure the Grail will be meat and drink to you.<eos> Who is the Grail?<eos> That cannot be said;<eos> but if you yourself are called to its service that knowledge will not remain withheld.<eos> And see!<eos> I think I know you aright;<eos> no earthly path leads to it and none could tread it whom the Grail itself had not guided.
He's actually the one who motivated me to build my own hot rod.<eos> Let's get him out here with a big Tool Time welcome. Lisa, bring him on out.<eos> A big hand. Come on.<eos> - Here you go, Tim.<eos> - Thank you, Lisa.<eos> - Fred, good to have you here.<eos> - Great to be here, Tim. Great to be here.<eos> Good deal, All right, what are we gonna do on the next show?<eos> Well, Tim, first we're going to apply 120 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer.<eos> Do you suppose a fender has 120 coats cos it's cold?
There are no life signs. There are small power emanations.<eos> Life support is still functioning on minimal levels.<eos> Riker to Engineering.<eos> Geordi, transporter room three.<eos> Mr. Worf.<eos> This air's pretty stale.<eos> Life support is barely operating.<eos> See if you can increase the oxygen level.<eos> Commander, the transporter is still on line.<eos> It's being fed power from the auxiliary systems.
- Are you kidding?<eos> I just washed my hands!<eos> Cowles, party of ten.<eos> Yes, you're the first ones to arrive.<eos> This way, please.<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Hello! - How you doing?<eos> I hurt my back playing tennis.<eos> - We saw them together.<eos> - So, I see this film, and I'm gonna give it an 8.
You're gonna get hurt.<eos> Screw you, man.<eos> You gonna help me with the bags?<eos> You out of your mind? I ain't helping you with no bags.<eos> Come on, move!<eos> Get out of the way, huh?<eos> Yo, taxi!<eos> Shit!<eos> Shit!<eos> Move your ass an inch and you can kiss it goodbye.
Not yet.<eos> Damn. Honey, what's taking him so long?<eos> Tim, we have a yard full of children.<eos> We're supposed to be setting an example. You have to calm down.<eos> - Have a cookie.<eos> - Hot cookie! Hot cookie!<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> Dad, the exterminator wants to borrow a screwdriver.<eos> You know where they are.<eos> Get it yourself.
The biggest I've seen.<eos> No wonder Alexander tried to take it with him.<eos> Von Leer, don't...<eos> Another trap!<eos> We'll be crushed!<eos> I think that's the idea!<eos> Professor, the plaque said to get out we have to go through a maze.<eos> The maze of the eye.<eos> Give me the stone, Von Leer.<eos> You want to be buried with it for another 3, 000 years?
A bunch of us are going on an archaeological dig in the mountains.<eos> The Wallaces said it would be OK as long as we had adult supervision, so don't worry!<eos> They're looking out for me.<eos> They're really great people, and I like them a lot.<eos> But they're kinda serious.<eos> They don't have your sense of humour, Mom.<eos> Mom, I miss you.<eos> Captain's log, stardate 45129.2.<eos> We are in pursuit of the crystalline entity.<eos> Data and Dr Marr are prepared to attempt communication when we intercept it.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> When?<eos> Okay.<eos> You still up?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are you chewing over?<eos> A dream I had once.<eos> I was walking in the woods, I don't know why.<eos> Wind kept moving, blew me hat off.<eos> And you chased it, right?
What are you chewing over?<eos> A dream I had once.<eos> I was walking in the woods, I don't know why.<eos> Wind kept moving, blew me hat off.<eos> And you chased it, right?<eos> You ran and ran, and finally you caught up to it.<eos> And you picked it up, but it wasn't a hat anymore.<eos> It had changed into something else, something wonderful.<eos> No, it stayed a hat.<eos> And, no, I didn't chase it.
Get on it.<eos> The stakes in sports memorabilia have gotten real high, MacGyver.<eos> Even a pair of kid's underwear signed by Babe Ruth got thousands bid on 'em.<eos> I mean, players change caps and jerseys several times in record-breaking games, so they can sell off more collectibles.<eos> And cons, creeps, and organized crime are taking advantage, because there's no real protection for the consumer, which are mostly kids.<eos> That makes me so mad, I could scream.<eos> So, you're a baseball fan.<eos> I'm not a fan, I'm a product.<eos> Product?<eos> I love baseball, and hate anything that hurts it.
Mr. Riker?<eos> Captain?<eos> Set a course for a return to Starbase 133 immediately.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> Your word has always been good enough for me.<eos> I've had a team in Sick Bay for two hours.<eos> We've run the mass spectrometer on all particulates. We've scanned the EM spectrum in case there was a wave guide somehow leaking radiation.<eos> We've even crawled around in the life-support ductwork.<eos> Captain, I don't know what this vortex was that Doctor Crusher saw.<eos> I didn't just see it, I felt it. I barely escaped from it.
It's been five months since Marc's accident.<eos> I haven't missed a single hour of my duties.<eos> I volunteered for extra time in the nursery.<eos> My language studies are better than they've ever been.<eos> Somebody else might've given in, but I didn't.<eos> - Given in to what?<eos> - Death is a normal part of life.<eos> Maybe some of us are better at facing that than others.<eos> Maybe some of us aren't facing it at all.
I don't understand.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It was instinct. I just touched him.<eos> I've run every test and scan on him that I can think of.<eos> There's no physiological evidence to indicate that he would possess such powers.<eos> But then, so much about John is a mystery.<eos> - You know, I really like him.<eos> - He does have a certain charm.<eos> The entire medical staff has commented on it.
Josie.<eos> Josie, you will never have to go back there.<eos> You're with me now...<eos> And now he'll kill the both of us.<eos> Let him try.<eos> Sorry, it took so long,<eos> - but we're short on help today.<eos> - That's quite all right.<eos> I've been looking forward to this pie.<eos> I've heard so much about it.
What harm could we do?<eos> I've met my old teacher and I'm showing him where I work.<eos> You could get into trouble.<eos> If there's any trouble, I'll take care of it.<eos> Because my sister is married so to speak, to the General Councilor.<eos> She had Bistagne named vice- president of the canal.<eos> And if Bistagne caused me trouble she'd stifle him with a pillow.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Here's my canal!<eos> It doesn't look like much but it lets you wash lettuce and your feet in the city.
Know what I mean?<eos> It's a little strong, so we put a little sugar in.<eos> It cuts the strength.<eos> Maybe a little more.<eos> All right. Drink it down.<eos> One gulp.<eos> Puts hair on your chest.<eos> Did my nephew explain this job to you?<eos> No, not really.<eos> It's best if you explain it, Uncle Carmine.
- What are these?<eos> - Oh, let me show you.<eos> Will you help me lift this up?<eos> - Just finished it.<eos> What do you think? - I love it.<eos> Sam, what's this chair doing here?<eos> - I love that chair.<eos> - I know, but we discussed this.<eos> I've had it forever.<eos> - When I watch TV, I sit in it.
Mind the posts!<eos> It's me. How are you?<eos> My legs hurt.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> Here I am again.<eos> Just like your father.<eos> Wait till I'm gone.<eos> What would I do without you?<eos> Where's the cat?<eos> Give it some water.
- There's four warning lights.<eos> Structural deficiency.<eos> Docking bay, aft.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> McBride, let's go!<eos> We got a leak. The main strut may go.<eos> Bring it up! That's good.<eos> Get the extender real quick.<eos> Put it up there.<eos> Crank it up.
I'm on it.<eos> McBride, let's go!<eos> We got a leak. The main strut may go.<eos> Bring it up! That's good.<eos> Get the extender real quick.<eos> Put it up there.<eos> Crank it up.<eos> I'm switching on auxiliary.<eos> I'm on count.<eos> Crank it up!
Next day after dawn, doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse... and follows so the ever-running year... with profitable labor to his grave.<eos> And but for ceremony... such a wretch, winding up days of toil... and nights with sleep... had the forehand and vantage... of a king.<eos> My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence, seek through the camp to find you.<eos> Good old knight, Collect them all together at my tent.<eos> I'll be before thee.<eos> O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts. Possess them not with fear.<eos> Take from them now their sense of reckoning... if the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them.<eos> Not today, o God, oh, not today.<eos> Think not upon the fault my father made encompassing the crown.<eos> I Richard's body have interred new... and on it have bestowed more contrite tears... than from it issued forced drops of blood.
It was crowded, there were just two places to stand in the upper echelon, and they were too expensive for commoners.<eos> Then a figure tread onto the stage as if it were rising from hell.<eos> His black frock was crumpled, as though he had slept in it.
After eating an 18-Pound turkey,<eos> You have room for an entire sweet potato pie?<eos> If you must know, i ate the pie first,<eos> And only half of that.<eos> What happened to the other half?<eos> I gave it to ed.<eos> Ed?<eos> The bum.<eos> His name is ed?<eos> Well, it could be.
- Oh, you're not so bad for a brat.<eos> - I mean it, Lee, please.<eos> This bill is important.<eos> You're the one who said so.<eos> What are you getting so mad at me for?<eos> I'm not mad at you.<eos> Oh, I'm not mad at you, sis.<eos> I'm--<eos> I'm mad at death.<eos> I wish I could punch it right in the nose.
They blew up the embassy, so that's that.<eos> Still, a lifetime of habit keeps my pen moving.<eos> I've borne witness to yet another massacre.<eos> This one, I'm to be a part of.<eos> The latest barbarian hordes have stormed another city, killing, plundering, burning, out of control.<eos> Women, kids, everybody dies.<eos> Grotesquely.<eos> Sometimes at the hands of 13- or 14-year-old children with guns, knives and flamethrowers.<eos> I'm sitting in a cell for three days now that Edgar Allen Poe could have described more eloquently than I.<eos> The stink of death almost as overpowering as the anticipation of it by all of us here, as every little while, a few more of us are taken out and shot.
- It's here!<eos> - Yes?<eos> Brilliant!<eos> Hurry!<eos> So what's it look like I'm doing?<eos> It's useless - we can't even slow it down!<eos> you're finished.<eos> There it is.<eos> That circuit is responsible for the DNA lock.<eos> We just have to break it.
- I'm thinking about nightmares.<eos> No, no.<eos> They have to hear this.<eos> Like I say, it might save their life one day.<eos> Now, I saw that bear.<eos> It saw me.<eos> And it was hungry.<eos> Hungry for blood!<eos> Human blood.<eos> You see, once a bear gets a taste for blood... it craves it.
So they won`t listen to Abby.<eos> Maybe you are right.<eos> lt`s not up to us.<eos> -How about dessert?<eos> -Please.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Look at this!<eos> Get a broom.<eos> Please don`t!<eos> I wasn`t going to hurt it.
I'll be right back.<eos> You two stay right here.<eos> Is there something wrong with my turkey?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, there's no turkey problem at all.<eos> - This is a very happy bird.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's happier than heck to be dead right here in our kitchen.<eos> I'm just gonna shove that sucker back in the oven for just a couple more minutes.<eos> Are you sure there's nothing wrong with it?
Throw up the rock and hit it with the stick.<eos> Why didn't you use a ball?<eos> It's easy to tell you've never been blind.<eos> If I hit a ball, I'd have to spend a lot of time going to get it.<eos> Lose a rock, no big deal.<eos> That's pretty smart.<eos> You know, people think I'm crazy when I tell them that I am going to try out for the Cincinnati Reds, but I know I can pitch.<eos> I can hit the strike zone blind.<eos> Imagine how good I'm gonna be if I could see.<eos> And the arm, it's as good as new, it's got a lot of mileage left on it.
Then she'll fall in lοve with him, prοbably when she's expecting their third child.<eos> I hadn't realised that cοmmοnsense is as pοwerful an instinct as lοve, hatred οr patriοtism.<eos> Ηοw very cοmmοn-sensible οf yοu tο realise it. Inspectοr, dο yοu think he'll admit tο it?<eos> The lab will be able tο nail him, but I think he'll talk.<eos> As yοu said, he's a planner, nοt an imprοviser.<eos> Martine Perrault was a gοοd Cathοlic and in the end he realised she wοuld never agree tο a divοrce.<eos> Ηe had tο be free tο marry Emma.<eos> Ηe was cοnvinced that Ηarοld knew whο Martine was sο he killed him, but I believe Dr Quimper wanted tο remοve mοst οf the family, and that evil-minded will οf Jοsiah's meant that he'd becοme a very rich man.<eos> Ηis οbsessive cοncern fοr Luther's health was a cοver fοr the day when he'd make it break dοwn cοmpletely.<eos> I suspect he knew that Alfred had a fatal illness and deliberately did nοt diagnοse it early enοugh.
Our dog!<eos> That's our dog!<eos> He killed our dog!<eos> You're in luck, it missed the bone.<eos> Where's the captain?<eos> - Don't move!<eos> - I want to see him now!<eos> You stole our dog!<eos> It wandered over.<eos> I just gave it sugar.
- You understand it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What's it say?<eos> - I cannot tell you that now.<eos> - It'll be revealed to you at the proper time.<eos> - Great.<eos> Don't be disappointed.<eos> Back to your Schwartz training.<eos> Here, take the ring.<eos> Point it at that big statue.
Readjustment is not required.<eos> Execute adjustment.<eos> Very well, Dr. Ludlum.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Guess you owe me a quarter, huh?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> I got in, didn't I?<eos> You came in with the truck, didn't you?<eos> - Under it.
I'm not finished yet. Yes, you are. You want to talk to one of my personnel, you go through the proper channels.<eos> All right.<eos> Or maybe $3 million's enough to share.<eos> (Martin) Crockett.<eos> Can you wait outside?<eos> Sonny, I'd like to talk to you.<eos> You fed us to Fuente for a bogus IA investigation.<eos> You compromised us!<eos> There's still a way, Crockett.<eos> You want to hear it?
Mind your backs.<eos> Come on. Come.<eos> - Mr. Steele!<eos> - I know. Put it on your bill.<eos> Come on, Bing.<eos> - I'm scared.<eos> - I can't do it.<eos> - Of course you can.<eos> There's an old Somali proverb, Bing.<eos> A brave man is afraid of a lion only three times in his life- when he first sees the tracks, when he first hears it roar... and when he first looks it in the eye.
They were neither sad nor scared-- just like animals whose feelings cannot be read.<eos> Then, I saw his tiny bright eyes.<eos> Everything in him was small.<eos> He was staring at an apple left on the table.<eos> I went up to the table.<eos> He looked at me. His eyes seemed to laugh.<eos> I sent the apple rolling to the floor.<eos> Several children jumped on it but he grabbed it.<eos> I knew he would.<eos> Some boys tried to take it but I pushed them away and took him to the small room.
I'm a little upset.<eos> I'm a little angry. I'm tired of being shot at.<eos> I'm tired of being treated like a sexual object.<eos> - I wish you listened to us yesterday.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I'm ready to listen now.<eos> Okay?<eos> So, what's going on?<eos> Carlino is hitting an armored truck.<eos> It carries the union's pension and welfare money.
Damn!<eos> He just tore off my ear!<eos> He's lucky he had a chance to escape before I kicked his ass big leatherneck, jarhead motherfucker!<eos> Something must be done about this Gunney Highway.<eos> Yes!<eos> But what are we going to do?<eos> - Wait till the Swede gets out of the brig!<eos> - That's it!<eos> The Swede!<eos> - Yes! He'll rip his head off and dump in it!
- Aye, but 'tis a sorry duty to kill... men, women and childrenfor the sake of a nation's gold.<eos> These are savages...<eos> cannibals, some of them! - They don't even know the value of gold.<eos> - Value of gold!<eos> Kapatek-Anahuac!<eos> Is it God? An eagle? The sun or the moon?<eos> The throne carries a curse if it is removed from its rightful place.<eos> The other night... I dreamed... it was red with blood...<eos> If we were wisewe would hurl it overboard...<eos> The Neptune might sit on it without fear or remorse... but we poor mortals...
- And you, sir?<eos> - I, mam'selle?<eos> - Why did you come to my rescue?<eos> Why did you kill one ofyour comrades for my sake?<eos> Ahoy there, sonny!<eos> Come over here by us!<eos> Or take her into the bushes!<eos> Very good morning to you, Master Carpenter.<eos> I was just a'wonderin' if you had any further need o' me ring?<eos> Since I've been parted from it, 'tis as though I were missin' a finger.
Let's go!<eos> The way you guys are going at it... you'd think you'd actually have a chance of winning.<eos> A good chance, Steve.<eos> Now shove off, will you?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll shove that rookie right off the track while I'm at it.<eos> Hey, you pull anything like that...<eos> Take it easy, Elena.<eos> He's just trying to psyche me out.<eos> I'd be working on my own car, if I were you... trying to squeeze every rev you can out of it.
What a pity, Michael. I was looking forward to that lecture on mass and velocity.<eos> Michael, you have no idea how much this hurts me.<eos> Why don't we change places?<eos> But that's just it.<eos> There's no need for either one of us to be here.<eos> All I really wanna know is who you are.<eos> I told you my name is... Dr. Michael Knightwood.<eos> I work for AlgoTech Industries.<eos> I'm sure you had me checked out.<eos> A computer is only as trustworthy as the information fed into it.
In England, the lRA.<eos> Some real nice people, Mario.<eos> Real nice.<eos> Who you working for this time?<eos> You got all the answers, smart boy.<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> All right.<eos> You landed in Toronto.<eos> You went straight to a dealership, paid cash for a vintage car.<eos> Twenty-four hours later, you crashed it through the Custom's gate at Niagara Falls.
Usually I say that.<eos> Goodbye, my friends!<eos> Centurion Vapetibus!<eos> I welcome you, Centurion Vapetibus.<eos> I'm at your service.<eos> Get to work, Gaul!<eos> Waitress, I'm thirsty!<eos> One glass of wine!<eos> Has the wind damaged a fence?<eos> Yes, when the wind blows, nothing can resist it.
- Uh, she, uh...<eos> She owns a service.<eos> She walks dogs and waters plants for people who, uh, can't do it themselves.<eos> She owns a service?<eos> How many employees does she have?<eos> Well, actually, she's the only employee.<eos> But the girl is a wonder.<eos> I mean, we had this ficus once that just drooped over and quit one day.<eos> Well, Amanda would not let it die.<eos> I mean, she re-potted it, she nursed it, she talked to it she pleaded with it.
Sort of.<eos> But my mind was always on the game.<eos> So I figured to give it another try.<eos> Just like that?<eos> Just like that.<eos> Where you from?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Do you always talk this way about yourself?<eos> Let me tell you something about Pop.<eos> He gave his heart and soul to the game only to get it trampled on.
Here, here. It's for the pigs!<eos> And the other.<eos> "Don't give them anything you could eat yourself."<eos> I'm not having her thinking we just put rubbish in the bin.<eos> We should have one or two maraschino cherries! It would show that we had cocktails.<eos> But we don't have cocktails.<eos> I'm carrying you, Gilbert.<eos> Now that, Betty, have you missed me?<eos> Eh, how's your foot?<eos> Is it better again? It is better again, isn't it?
The Memoirs say he goes to school. And he will, even if I have to take him! - I'd love to see that.<eos> - Really? I'll talk to him.<eos> - Pass it back!<eos> - Here! - Give it to me! Adam!<eos> Are you coming to school? I heard what happened to you.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> Everything will turn out fine.<eos> The new house will be even better. Nobody got hurt?<eos> As for me, for example, my TV just got broken.<eos> Talking of which, tell your father to come and look at it, when he's got some time... - Good morning, Miss!
Lynch is right behind us, baby.<eos> Get the clearance.<eos> Got him.<eos> Murdock, go!<eos> Hey, Faceman.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Hannibal wanted me to tell you we're headed to Acapulco.<eos> I don't have no flight plans for Mexico.<eos> I could follow up the coast, but we don't have enough fuel.<eos> It's better if I swing by the airport and try to pick up a flight and follow it down.
Take it up with him.<eos> Kappler.<eos> Then you make a wish... .. and you... you throw them in...<eos> -.. and your wish will come true.<eos> Mamma says if you throw in a coin, it means one day you will come back to Rome.<eos> That's a wish that's bound to be granted because we're never going to leave.<eos> After all the trouble I'd taken to land on a bunker, the Bishop hit his ball a mighty swipe and it disappeared.<eos> It wasn't on the fairway, it wasn't in the rough.<eos> Where was it?<eos> - It had ricocheted off a tree, hit the fence and bounced into the back of an open truck, which took it all the way to Genoa.
When they know too much, they give 'em new identities.<eos> - Anyway, the computer said so.<eos> - Oh, the computer said so.<eos> The computer that's still playing the games?<eos> It's the military's computer!<eos> - Why wouldn't they know about it?<eos> - They don't know about Joshua.<eos> Falken knows about Joshua.<eos> He's the only one who knows what it can do.<eos> That computer is trying to win the game that we asked it to play.
Unless we want one.<eos> Of course, Your Outrageousness.<eos> So this is my new confessional?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> It works this way, Your Ferocity.<eos> If you will, please.<eos> The prisoner... is totally restrained... by means of this iron banding.<eos> Excellent. Excellent.<eos> But there is more to it than that, Your Blizzard of the Wrong.<eos> By means of these ratchets and these screws... you can place his body in any position that you want... for as long as you want and do anything to it that you want.
My father says that a woman who studies Talmud is a demon.<eos> She's not a demon, she just has big ears.<eos> So you don't need to tell your father.<eos> Bye, David.<eos> Now the whole village will be talking about us.<eos> Papa, you shouldn't smoke.<eos> Do you think the angel of death will be frightened away by cough medicine?<eos> - First, you don't have to drown him in it.<eos> - Again.<eos> - Second, he's beginning to Like it.
Item 7.<eos> What is item 7?<eos> Well, if I may just recapitulate...<eos> Sorry, Minister.<eos> You can't actually recapitulate an item if you haven't started it yet.
Parapsychology isn't something you master in.<eos> There are no certificates of graduation... no licenses to practice.<eos> I am a professional psychologist. I spend most of my time engaged in this ghostly hobby. Which makes me the most irresponsible woman of my age that I know.<eos> Would you like a glass for that?<eos> You know, you were very funny.<eos> Your hands were shaking about a mile a minute.<eos> This isn't over.<eos> I'm absolutely terrified.<eos> It's all the things that we don't understand.<eos> I feel like the protohuman, coming out of the forest primeval... and seeing the moon for the first time and throwing rocks at it.
Well, just watch how you do that too.<eos> This Ike Godsey, where does he live?<eos> In the back of the store.<eos> You mean that's it?<eos> That's, uh, home and business for Ike Godsey?<eos> - Him and Corabeth.<eos> - Well, I'll be dadgum.<eos> Much obliged, son.<eos> - You want me to work on your car? - No.<eos> That's for not coming close to it.
I want to just talk about it.<eos> - I see that you are interested.<eos> - Please come.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Thank you. Why are you interested in the haunted lake dead?<eos> I wonder why the so called ...<eos> The name was given recently.<eos> About three centuries ago?<eos> You are wrong. His real name is garden lake lake, and not cursed.<eos> The locals call it so.
But I'll tell you something else.<eos> You must write this down so that people remember.<eos> So they don't forget.<eos> How they treated those poor dead people!<eos> After all, a dead person is sacred!<eos> There were so many of them!<eos> I was looking for Mateusz.<eos> All we could see were their feet, with these name tags... tied to their toes.<eos> I recognized Mateusz by his smashed toe.<eos> A beam had fallen on it once.
Then why isn't she conscious? She's been like this for months.<eos> She only mo ves when you turn on that goddamn machine.<eos> Dr. Feinblum, her alphas are up again. I'll switch out.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Virginia, can you hear me?<eos> My birthday.<eos> I was an experiment, David.<eos> Just like that frog in the lab.<eos> The principle is very simple.<eos> When a salamander loses its tail, it grows a new one.
Let what I put into words for no one then remain for ever unspoken.<eos> When talking to you I am talking only to myself...<eos> When young love's delight declined in me my spirit thirsted for power.<eos> Driven by raging, impetuous desires, I won the world for myself.<eos> Unwittingly dishonest, I committed a wrong, binding myself by treaties that concealed evil.<eos> I was craftily lured on by Loge, who now, the vagabond, has vanished.<eos> Yet I could not abstain from love: with all my power, I still hungered for love.<eos> The thwarted Nibelung, Alberich, broke from night's bonds. He cursed love, and through that curse and gained the Rhine's glittering gold and, with it, immeasurable power.<eos> The ring he made I took from him by treachery, but did not return it to the Rhine.<eos> With it I paid for the battlements of Valhalla, the castle the giants built for me,
Now follow him whom you must love!<eos> If I must depart from Valhalla, no longer to work and act with you, and belong henceforth to a man as master, do not give me as prize to some cowardly boaster.<eos> Let whoever wins me not be worthless.<eos> You flouted the father of battles:<eos> now he cannot choose for you.<eos> You begot a noble race.<eos> No coward can disgrace it.<eos> The most dedicated of heroes, I know, will spring from Wälsung stock.<eos> Do not speak to me of the Wälsung race!<eos> In flinging you off, I have flung it off too.
Oblomov, seeing his mother, who had been dead for years, even in his sleep, felt a tremor of joy and ardent love for her,<eos> and two warm tears oozed slowly from under his eyelashes and rested on his cheeks.<eos> Ilya Ilyich!<eos> Can't you stay awake for at least five minutes?<eos> Olga, I'm sorry, I...<eos> I don't think I was sleeping, I seemed to see everything around me.<eos> Oblomov wanted to tell Olga what he had seen, but suddenly he yawned.<eos> My doctor tells me to go travelling, but I can't.<eos> I told Andrei so. Sometimes I feel as though I am a small part of a big whole, as a leaf on a branch.<eos> Then I'm calm and happy, as though I can hear how the sap runs down the trunk, how the tree begins to sway, and I sway with it, and I'm not afraid.
Right!<eos> You killed my father?<eos> Right again!<eos> You killed him for the swords?<eos> You can say that<eos> Still call yourself a swordsman?<eos> A swordsman is one who knows how to use a sword<eos> And I know how to use one<eos> We've killed your man<eos> It makes no difference who brings me the sword
- I'd be honoured.<eos> What scene?<eos> Miranda's first encounter with other human beings.<eos> "O brave new world, That has such people in't."<eos> It seemed appropriate.<eos> Captain, you took a substantial risk in allowing the Enterprise to complete its task.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Because the end result was unknown.<eos> The object could have been dangerous. It may in fact be dangerous.<eos> And I have allowed it to go off on its merry way.
- Never.<eos> On my honour.<eos> Heaven bless you.<eos> Farewell.<eos> It's fascinating.<eos> Every season, the same play, the same scenes, the same effect on the audience.<eos> Remarkable, isn't it, Newland?<eos> I'm enjoying it even more than the London production.<eos> You see this play even when you travel?<eos> - I'd travel to get away from it.
The truthful one.<eos> Passionate, uninhibited, even lustful.<eos> And most of us keep that inner being hidden away, locked up.<eos> But the fiction writer doesn't have to hide it, doesn't have to keep it from anything.<eos> He can let it out, bring it out in the open, let it live.<eos> Hell, he can give it the car keys, let it ride! Yes!<eos> In fact, he has to do that.<eos> It's essential.<eos> The writer has to let that inner being out of the lockup.<eos> He has to let it have a voice in his work otherwise the work itself will be inhibited.
I understand you brought back an Orb.<eos> We thought we had all of them.<eos> Perhaps we could have an exchange of information, pool our resources?<eos> I know nothing about an Orb.<eos> We will be in close proximity if you wish to reconsider my suggestion.<eos> In the meantime, I assume you have no objection to my men enjoying the hospitality of the Promenade.<eos> Commander.<eos> What do you know about the Denorios Belt?<eos> A charged plasma field.<eos> No one gets near it unless they have to.
Superintendent Cheung.<eos> I'm going to step outside to answer this call.<eos> It may be a call from an informer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, follow up on this for me, okay?<eos> Master Hung.<eos> We're in trouble. There's a mainland gunboat.<eos> It looks like it's approaching us.<eos> What should we do now?<eos> Try your best to evade it!
Hey, man, it's rubber.<eos> Yes.<eos> It was a test, not an attack.<eos> I've studied Chito Ryu.<eos> [GRUNTING]<eos> I've studied Muay Thai.<eos> But mostly I've combined them all to create my own style.<eos> I've been dedicated in training my body to master all these physical skills to be comfortable to weapons of defense and death.<eos> Your skill is great.<eos> I cannot add to it.
Sure.<eos> And the breeze.<eos> Can you feel the breeze?<eos> Can you smell its fragrance?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like....<eos> Like Echo Lake after a thunderstorm.<eos> [LAUGHING]<eos> Well the painting is of harmony.<eos> If you can become one with it that's kung fu.
(Sisko) Station Log, supplemental.<eos> Odo and Ambassador Troi remain trapped in turbolift 4.<eos> As of yet, we have been unable to ascertain what is causing the station's computer to malfunction.<eos> What if it's some kind of nonbiological life-form we've never seen before?<eos> Nonbiological?<eos> It all comes down to how we define life-form.<eos> Just as biological organisms have evolved in our cultures, mechanical life could have done the same in others.<eos> You're suggesting someone left a baby at our doorstep?<eos> Possibly.<eos> Do you think we can communicate with it?
Data?<eos> Deck 36.<eos> Hello, Data.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Hold very still, Counsellor.<eos> No!<eos> Ever since you gave Alexander that music, he's been playing it all night, every night.<eos> I just wanted to broaden his horizons.<eos> He likes it.
I have returned.<eos> You doubt me.<eos> Who here knows the story of how this sword was forged?<eos> No one knows.<eos> It is not written in the sacred texts.<eos> I went into the mountains, all the way to the volcano at Kri'stak.<eos> There I cut off a lock of my hair and thrust it into the molten rock that poured from the summit.<eos> The hair began to burn.<eos> Then I plunged it into the Lake of Lusor, and twisted it into this sword.<eos> And after I used it to kill Molor, I gave it a name.
I don't claim to know all the answers... but if we don't make the OPR inquest by tomorrow... there may not be any more X-Files.<eos> (man wailing)<eos> (commotion and men wailing)<eos> Start an IV here.<eos> D5, half-normal saline at 150.<eos> - Tell us what happened out there.<eos> - Mulder, it has nothing to do with you.<eos> Wrong, Colonel.<eos> We both want the same thing, only you want it dead.<eos> Can't you see by chasing it like an animal you leave it no choice but to defend itself?
(sighs) Well, now it's like a stroll around the block.<eos> So, how can I help you?<eos> This found its way to the FBI.<eos> Do you recognise it?<eos> Sure. It's an auxiliary power unit valve.<eos> Do you have any reason to believe it was damaged... in an effort to sabotage the Space Program?<eos> No.<eos> - Do you have reason to suspect it at all?<eos> - No reason whatsoever.<eos> If you have any respect for this program and for those who have devoted their lives to it... you'll be careful to whom you make those accusations.
Can we eat?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You hungry?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm hungry. - What do you feel like?<eos> - A chef's salad.<eos> Did I do the wrong thing?<eos> I don't know, honey.<eos> Beethoven made this house real.<eos> He put the dents in it.
No one else seemed to mind.<eos> Kicking an immigration officer on the backside.<eos> You think that's funny?<eos> For those of us with a sense of humour, very.<eos> It was supposed to be a comedy.<eos> You've turned it into a bloody political tract.<eos> We're guests here.<eos> You can't criticize the way it's run.<eos> Syd, I love this country.<eos> I owe it everything.
Mrs. Hunsaker says that you gentlemen were at a vantage point last night to observe who was responsible for this<eos> stunt.<eos> Who was it?<eos> I really couldn't tell you, sir.<eos> I thought I saw someone fooling with the lamppost, but by the time I pulled focus, they were gone.<eos> Mr. Simms?<eos> I couldn't say.<eos> That automobile is not just a possession of mine.<eos> That automobile was presented to me by the board of trustees.<eos> It is a symbol of the standard of excellence for which this school is known, and I will not have it tarnished.
It's nice.<eos> Careful.<eos> It's wood.<eos> Very funny.<eos> On, wood...<eos> We'll go back and get them.<eos> Yeah, and they're just waiting around torus. Bastards.<eos> Don't cry. That won't get us anywhere.<eos> I'm not crying for myself. I'm crying for the little lamb.<eos> If God gives a lamb, he gives it food.
Whatever flies I can hit in flight!<eos> You did this?<eos> And you're not worried by the deed?<eos> Punish the offender!<eos> Unprecedented act!<eos> You could murder, here in the holy forest, where tranquil peace surrounded you?<eos> Did not the woodland beasts tamely come near and innocently greet you as friends?<eos> What did the birds sing to you from the branches?<eos> What harm did that faithful swan do you?<eos> Seeking his mate, he flew up to circle with it over the lake and gloriously to hallow the bath.
We were retracing the steps of a murder. Terrible stabbing.<eos> - Monsieur Clancy, I am talking about a real murder, and one of the chief suspects is yourself.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> You had the opportunity, and you were observed to pass by Madame Giselle during the flight.<eos> - I deny it.<eos> - But I saw you, Mr. Clancy.<eos> You were carrying a book.<eos> - Oh, yes, of course.<eos> My Bradshaw.<eos> It gives the railway times.
What a blessing.<eos> It shouldn't be much of a strain on your salary which couldn't support a family of goats in the mountains of Paraguay.<eos> But on the bright side, another child could be such a joy.<eos> Let's take the time to think of all the things that you can teach him.<eos> Well, I can't think of anything.<eos> Can you?<eos> Now, Marcie don't take this as an insult you parakeet in a flannel shirt.<eos> But speaking as a friend your body shows no signs of womanhood.<eos> Obvious to me, you're barren.<eos> And even if by some miracle you actually laid an egg and then hatched a child and tried to breast-feed it, the kid would starve to death.
What are you suggesting?<eos> That you confine yourself to your quarters, until we have unravelled this mystery.<eos> - We're to be prisoners?<eos> - Father.<eos> No, please, don't look on it like that.<eos> We have done everything we can to explain these comas.<eos> Physical examinations, neurological scans. We have conducted a ship-wide diagnostic looking for viruses, parasites, infestations.<eos> We have investigated every cause we can imagine and found nothing, nothing to explain these comas.<eos> The only variable that we have not been able to eliminate is your presence here on this ship.<eos> Now, in the light of our actions, we would ask you to understand my request and to agree to it.
- Relax. That fly boy hangs one on my kisser and you let him waltz?<eos> Maybe you had it comin'.<eos> - We need a word with the patient.<eos> - In private.<eos> Your buddy's getting fitted for a pine overcoat.<eos> If you make it to County General, Alcatraz is your new digs.<eos> Spit it out, Wilmer.<eos> Where's the package?<eos> Blown to hell.<eos> Why don't you go look for it?
No, I'm really into photography, not movies.<eos> But movies are photography, 24 times a second.<eos> Did I invite you over here to talk to me?<eos> When young, we mourn for one woman.<eos> As we grow old, for women in general.<eos> The tragedy of life... is that man is never free... yet strives for what can never be.<eos> The thing most feared in secret... always happens.<eos> My life, my loves, what are they now?<eos> But the more the pain grows... the more this instinct for life somehow asserts itself.<eos> The necessary beauty in life is in giving yourself to it completely. - Only later will it clarify itself... and become coherent.
I was there, with Keaton, Chaplin, Lloyd.<eos> Now, all these people will see my three best movies, never seen before!<eos> I'll make 'em laugh.<eos> I'll make 'em cry.<eos> Oh, when you're as old as I am, you'll realize how grateful an old guy like me can be for that, oh...<eos> Take care of 'em.<eos> You know I will, Pink.<eos> I just, I just can't believe it.<eos> It's like I've gotten my whole life back again.<eos> Well now you can kiss it goodbye.
Now, you can pull it away.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Good.<eos> That bundle of wires, that's optical cabling.<eos> See how much of that you can pull out.<eos> The levels are still rising.<eos> There must be a way to put that fire out.<eos> It's fed by the ship's internal power grid.<eos> We can't get near that.<eos> The only way to stop it would be to eliminate its supply of oxygen.
Peter?<eos> I've read every recent case where the Rhode Island Supreme Court reversed.<eos> They don't like to make new law or discuss broad legal issues.<eos> When they do reverse, the grounds are technical, but the reason seems to be they suspect a convicted defendant may be innocent.<eos> OK, everybody get that?<eos> True or not, we've gotta convince the judges that you are innocent.<eos> Claus, now I do wanna hear your side of the story.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> Innocence has always been my position.<eos> First coma: what preceded it?
Always expect the unexpected.<eos> Sensei Musashi?<eos> I'm Jack Marshak.<eos> I called you about a black antique tea set.<eos> Mmm, tuna tartare with quail's egg.<eos> It's my favorite.<eos> So why did you want this particular black tea set?<eos> It's old and it isn't valuable.<eos> It is to us.<eos> Because of the magic it possesses?
The hands and face are the most severe.<eos> Ten years ago, pain from the burns would have been intolerable.<eos> He would have spent his life screaming.<eos> Now we use the Rangeveritz Technique.<eos> Quite simply, we sever the nerves within the spino-thalamic tract, there... which, as you know, transmits neural impulses of pain and vibratory sense to the brain.<eos> No longer receiving impulses of pain, you stick him with a pin...<eos> Ouch. And he can't even feel it.<eos> As in many radical procedures, there are serious side effects to this operation.<eos> When the body ceases to feel, when so much sensory input is lost, the mind grows hungry.<eos> Starved of its regular diet of input, it takes the only remaining stimulation it has... the emotions... and amplifies them, giving rise to alienation and loneliness.
So don't you bother me.<eos> - Watch it!<eos> - Go away!<eos> Run, run, run, run, run, run.<eos> Get up a tree!<eos> You okay?<eos> - You said if I didn't bother them...<eos> - I see there's a baby rhino.<eos> Maybe the mother thought you were molesting it.<eos> I only talked to it.
Where?<eos> Where?<eos> I'm asking where you get the stuff!<eos> Where does it come from?<eos> Tell me where.<eos> - Tell me where.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You know where!<eos> From Iwaki, your pal!<eos> - What does he have to do with it?
As it happens, I have 364 gold pieces.<eos> Aye, and I come to wager them against yours.<eos> My husband, sir, is a devil with the dice.<eos> Yes, of course, I am.<eos> But I can't be winning money.<eos> I am playing for higher stakes.<eos> I must find a story before nightfall, else I shall...<eos> I know, I shouldn't have, but the gold sparkled.<eos> I should have said no, but the gold glittered.<eos> The morning frittered away, my fortune with it.
Now, Leo's famished, and he loves a fish... but he's suffered sufficient, this fellow.<eos> Back he goes to where the salmon is king.<eos> "Thank you," cries the fish.<eos> I'd have scoffed him, if he was so hungry. I like fish.<eos> Would you? Listen.<eos> He goes on a little further, and now his horse gives up the ghost.<eos> His old horse who's carried the prince a 1,000 miles and more... sinks slowly to his knees and rolls over on his side... and dies.<eos> So did the prince eat his horse?<eos> No, he didn't, he couldn't.<eos> He lay down beside it, famished and forlorn.
I, a free man an unimpassioned man. I am wounded wounded like an animal<eos> I suffer like an animal like Piotr.<eos> What I brought along with me was chaos.<eos> Any order any cheerfulness clarity tranquility have gone.<eos> As if, with her death, a nightmare has gone without a dream a dream without wake a wake without dream<eos> I was taught that the eye of the world, which is watching me is the same eye with which I am watching the world.<eos> This eye is neither cheerful nor evil neither feeling nor expectant.<eos> It's indifferent, like water.<eos> I will stay with it.<eos> I will stay in it for as long as I can.
She's laughing provocatively, looking at Jaeck.<eos> She's surrounded by admirers.<eos> The face of Jaeck's assistant appears on the screen.<eos> Master, we have a signal.<eos> Keep talking to us.<eos> Where is Marek?<eos> Who sent you?<eos> We can see you. There is a white light over us.<eos> There is the eye which can see us.<eos> Speak to it!
Baccarat crystal.<eos> Louis XIII.<eos> VoiIá. Should we let it breathe?<eos> It hasn't breathed in 50 years.<eos> It's dead. Let's just drink it.<eos> - Health and friendship?<eos> - Life and love.<eos> Douglas Coughlin, your ship has certainly come in!<eos> My ship.<eos> My ship is going down, and I'm going down with it.
-Got it?<eos> -Yep.<eos> Hello there!<eos> I wanted to give you that application.<eos> -l'll get to it.<eos> -What's he doing?<eos> -Making contraptions for protection.<eos> -How does that thing work?<eos> -By remote control?<eos> -You talk to it.
You...<eos> The Jews will hang high over the streets.<eos> You will be buried in piles. You dig your own holes.<eos> I am here merely to tell you that the day will come.<eos> It will.<eos> Believe it or not, you make perfect sense to me.<eos> I should hang.<eos> I'm a hypocrite.<eos> I ask for sincerity, and I lie.<eos> I denounce the system as I embrace it.
Let's hope he stays there.<eos> - Any time you're ready.<eos> - Right.<eos> If I thought the North American division was in jeopardy from either of you we wouldn't be standing here under God's blue sky.<eos> But you are here, Mr. Jordan.<eos> You wouldn't be if we weren't in trouble.<eos> Certainly not.<eos> But as a matter of fact, your particular trouble is peering at us through his bifocals from the rear of that limousine.<eos> The Professor?<eos> - What about it, Peralta?
Now it's here, on Earth, in your city.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Are we talking spacemen here?<eos> The way it works is it finds a body... gets inside, uses it to move around.<eos> It stays in that body until the body is so damaged... it has to find another body.<eos> That's the only time I can kill it... when it's between bodies.<eos> I missed my chance when it came out of the stripper.<eos> It found another body and changed before I got there.<eos> So now we don't know who the spaceman is.<eos> But I don't have to look for it anymore.
Cut. [All cheering]<eos> Michael, are you okay?<eos> Well, I'm not. I broke another fingernail.<eos> She broke another fingernail.<eos> But I'm fine.<eos> I'm telling ya, I have a new respect for seafood.<eos> It really does help you live longer.<eos> Yeah, I'd have been here, but he got the drop on me.<eos> Oh, Michael, you were wonderful.<eos> You took a mediocre ending and you gave it new life.
Creb...<eos> Creb...<eos> Ayla?<eos> Ayla?<eos> Iza...<eos> The child must die.<eos> Ayla, the child must die.<eos> It will be a burden.<eos> No one will hunt for it. Ayla has no mate.<eos> If the child is to die I want to die with it.
Very strange mother.<eos> But I love my mother.<eos> Isolina, and my father, Gigi, and my sisters Bruna, Albertina, e Anna.<eos> My family and my rabbit.<eos> And I love to catch, to dream.<eos> What is? What?<eos> I knew! Come on. Come on.<eos> To eat the animal I have catched.<eos> The rabbit.<eos> I run half an hour behind it.
Paul Garrett, this is Mr. Fusco.<eos> Hello.<eos> Did you really see God?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> My father says you were only kidding.<eos> Were you kidding?<eos> What was he like?<eos> He was very friendly.<eos> - He came to see the play, you know.<eos> - I read he liked it.
You probably would look terrific doing it, too.<eos> I'll see you in the magazines.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> Now you can go.<eos> Bye.<eos> He'll be back.<eos> Is this your car?<eos> The last time I looked.<eos> Why?<eos> You ought to teach it better manners.
Sure, it's not even 2 yet.<eos> Ready?<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> I've wanted to ask you this all night.<eos> - Who's Franklin?<eos> - Franklin?<eos> Franklin is my husband.<eos> Really.<eos> Is that his loft, then?<eos> He owns it, yes.
Get the others!<eos> Get the others!<eos> Get the others!<eos> Where were you?<eos> Why weren't you at your post?<eos> What? Why weren't you at your post? !<eos> Why weren't you at your post?<eos> ! You're gonna make me deaf with that thing!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm doing my work. What's it look like to you? These things gotta be moved.
Here and here.<eos> Pauvre jambe.<eos> Come to the window.<eos> Turn out the light.<eos> - What are you watching?<eos> - It's a convalescence present, to celebrate your return to the zoo hotel.<eos> I turned out the rhino.<eos> - It followed me to the corner.<eos> - And you abandoned it. - It'll be all right.<eos> - Supposing it attacks someone? It won't. It's short-sighted.
They're keeping your father in Ali's palace.<eos> There are two guards with him.<eos> The moment has come.<eos> Ride.<eos> (Pierre) What's this about?<eos> Here comes a motorcycle.<eos> Has your father gone insane?<eos> He's getting on the motorbike!<eos> Patrik, do you hear?<eos> He's riding away on it!
And that, you fascist swine.!<eos> How does it feel to be on the receiving end, you illiterate thug?<eos> Oh, Steele!<eos> You ever see such viciousness?<eos> A few darts, Mr. Laidlaw?<eos> Oh, not me.<eos> That alleged critic.<eos> Syndicated in 200 papers.<eos> Every other critic in the country loved my new book.<eos> He gave it four yawns.
Please protect my people<eos> They won't budge<eos> They're waiting for her return<eos> Return?<eos> They believe that girl will return with their gun ship<eos> That gun ship's a pain It's our chance to attack<eos> Do you know what that ship is?<eos> It's from before the Seven Days of Fire<eos> The one they say went as far as the stars...<eos> It's too strong for our guns, but bury it in a hole...
Now Angka says we have new enemies.<eos> They say we must regain our old lands from the Vietnamese. And now they say we must fight them.<eos> I miss you, my wife, my children. And my heart hungers for news of you.<eos> New China Radio reports that fighting between Vietnam and Democratic Kampuchea has broken out on a number of fronts.<eos> This is in retaliation, according to the Vietnamese for a number of attacks on border villages...<eos> Taxi driver, huh?<eos> I think you speak English.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You know, I love this country.<eos> I sacrificed everything for it.
No.<eos> They got this whole system they call dream skills.<eos> So if you have a nightmare, for instance, like falling, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> - Well instead of screaming and getting all nuts you say, "Okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world. "<eos> Make it something special like a poem or a song.<eos> They get their art and literature from dreams.<eos> Just wake up and write it down.<eos> Well, what if they meet a monster in their dreams? Then what?<eos> They turn their back on it.
What the hell is this?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What the hell is going on down there?<eos> Move it! Assholes.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, you, give me that bike.<eos> Come on, move it. This is official police business. Move it out.<eos> BIKER: It's new.<eos> - Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt it.
- No! Today I'm working.<eos> - Can I put my jacket in here?<eos> - No, wait...<eos> Please...<eos> No, I can take that for you.<eos> Let me. Here.<eos> Look around.<eos> Here's what I want you to do.<eos> Transform this dungeon, if you can.<eos> Give it life and order and make it feel like a real person lives in here.
I want you to roll onto that proving ground and, without stopping, demolish a town.<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, not a real town.<eos> We built one.<eos> It just seems to me that in 3000 miles the opportunity for sabotage are enormous.<eos> That's precisely why you'll rendezvous with an undercover escort.<eos> And your time and place of departure will be kept secret.<eos> - Aren't we leaving from here?<eos> - The mock-up will.<eos> Hopefully, anybody watching will follow it.
This thing has antiterrorist capabilities.<eos> You saying it's armed?<eos> That I am. That it is.<eos> That sounds like it now.<eos> It's illegal to arm police helicopters.<eos> That would depend on the circumstances, wouldn't it?<eos> A lot of people ain't gonna like this.<eos> What do you call this, an "airbuster"?<eos> The Special.<eos> But somebody hung a nickname on it.
And the rough towels!<eos> Show it to the mother.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> - Right.<eos> Sedate her.<eos> - Number the child.<eos> - Measure it, blood-type it and isolate it.<eos> Okay, show's over.<eos> Is it a boy or a girl?<eos> I think it's a little early to start imposing roles on it, don't you?
How could such a crime be possible?<eos> My lord, rapt in dreams is the vain girl who so arrogantly spurned my hand.<eos> Thus do I accuse her of a secret amour.<eos> She clearly thought that, once rid of her brother, she as Duchess of Brabant could rightfully refuse the vassal her hand and openly tend her secret lover.<eos> Call the accused!<eos> Let the trial commence!<eos> May God grant me wisdom!<eos> Shall the trial be held in this place by might and right?<eos> May I remain unprotected by this shield until I have passed harsh and compassionate judgement!<eos> May the sword not return to the scabbard until it sees justice done through judgement!
Drawing Number 8.<eos> From 9 o'clock in the morning until 11... the gardens in front of the bath house building... will be kept clear.<eos> No coals will be burnt to cause smoke... to issue from the bath house chimney.<eos> From 11 o'clock in the morning until 1... the yew tree walk in the center of the lower garden... will be kept completely clear... and all members of Mr. Herbert's family... members of his household staff and animals.<eos> It is time, Mr. Neville.<eos> From 2 o'clock in the afternoon until 4... the back of the house and the sheep pasture... on the eastern side, will be kept free of all members... of the household and farm servants.<eos> The reason I've suggested you come here is... because I've borrowed this painting from the house.<eos> Would you stand?<eos> Are you not intrigued by it?<eos> I confess I have paid it little attention.
Well, I thought about it, but you could never have granted my true wish.<eos> No. I cannot turn you into something you are not.<eos> I cannot turn you into a true magician.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I'm not.<eos> What do you know of King Haggard?<eos> I have heard that he's an old man who rules over a barren country by the sea.<eos> Some say that Haggard's land was green and soft once, before he came.<eos> But the minute he touched it, it became hard and gray.
- No, it's a lie!<eos> You can't choose between life and death when dealing' with what is in between.<eos> Run to the light, baby.<eos> - Mommy is in the light. - Tell her you're waiting for her.<eos> Mommy is waiting for you in the light.<eos> I hate you for this.<eos> Now clear your minds.<eos> It knows what scares you.<eos> It has from the very beginning.<eos> Don't give it any help. It knows too much already.
In this house, only I do the belting!<eos> I shit on your adult status!<eos> Get to bed, the gang of you!<eos> Every day in every way, I'm getting a little better.<eos> Every day in every way, I'm getting a little better.<eos> - Did you practice?<eos> - Yes, to 200.<eos> Look.<eos> This is an exercise to make your eyes shine.<eos> Move your eyes to left and right under water for as long as you can stand it.
I ought to run right down there and join up?<eos> Well, I was gonna go over there.<eos> We could use your car.<eos> - We'd have to, wouldn't we?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You coming in?<eos> Hey, this is a loading zone.<eos> You can't park here.<eos> We're not parking it.<eos> We're abandoning it.
But death will force you, fool.<eos> I came here to tell you that. Where might the hero be to whom I must fall today?<eos> Hunding will slay you in battle.<eos> Threaten me with something stronger than Hunding's blows!<eos> If you lurk here, lusting for battle, choose him as your prey: I intend to kill him in the flight.<eos> On you, Wälsung, mark what I say.<eos> On you the lot has fallen.<eos> Do you know this sword?<eos> He who made it for me guaranteed me victory.<eos> With it I defy your threats.
You cannot dishonour what will always be a part of you, cannot wish for a disgrace that debases you.<eos> You would let yourself be demeaned if you saw me mocked and derided.<eos> You happily followed the power of love.<eos> Now follow him whom you must love!<eos> If I must depart from Valhalla, no longer to work and act with you, and belong henceforth to a man as master, do not give me as prize to some cowardly boaster.<eos> Let whoever wins me not be worthless.<eos> You flouted the father of battles:<eos> now he cannot choose for you.<eos> You begot a noble race.<eos> No coward can disgrace it.
They're better for taste than looks.<eos> That's a telephone.<eos> Oh, I've saw three or four of them in my time.<eos> I just ain't never talked through one.<eos> Well, it's easy.<eos> When it rings, all you do is pick it up and talk.<eos> I'll memorize that and when that feller....<eos> Cousin Zadok?<eos> There's a feller after me.<eos> If he rings that telephone, you come and get me, and I'll talk on it.
What's the time?<eos> Er, two a. m.<eos> Good God, what's the crisis?<eos> No. No crisis.<eos> I'm going through my boxes, and I knew you'd still be hard at it.<eos> Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.<eos> Nose to the grindstone.<eos> Well, I've just come across this Data Base paper.<eos> Oh, you've found... you've read it!<eos> Thought I'd bettertell you I'm not happy with it.
I mean, could you developthat point please?<eos> Would you say that the Ministeris starting to run the Department?<eos> Yes, things are going pretty well,actually.<eos> No, when a Ministeractuallystarts to run his Department things are not going pretty well.<eos> They are actuallygoing prettybadly.<eos> But actually... er...<eos> I mean, in fact, isn't it the Minister's jobto run the Department?<eos> No, Bernard, it is ourjob.<eos> Orto be more precise,it is my job, forwhich I've had 25 yearsexperience and training.<eos> Don't you realise whatwouldhappen if the Ministerruns it?
I do not deserve these names.<eos> I am guilty towards you, but my fault is pardonable.<eos> How pardonable?<eos> Such an assassination as this!<eos> I beseech you not to be so angry with me.<eos> You will see that the harm is not so great as you make it out to be.<eos> The harm not so great as I make it out to be.<eos> What, my heart's blood, scoundrel!<eos> Your blood, sir, has not fallen into bad hands.<eos> My rank is high enough not to disgrace it and there is nothing in all this for which reparation cannot be made.
He couldn't wait to show her the landscape without the bush, which so much annoyed her.<eos> He waited and she did not appear.<eos> The happiness that overfilled him was slowly going away.<eos> Nature was busy around him.<eos> The bustle of unseen life was stirring all about him, and yet nature seemed to be lying in majestic repose.<eos> But everything in the grass was moving, creeping, hurrying.<eos> Ants were racing in all directions, so busily jostling each other, running about, hastening.<eos> Here was a bumble-bee buzzing about a flower and crawling into its bell.<eos> A bird in the thicket had been repeating one and the same note, perhaps calling to its mate.<eos> A strong scent came from the grass, and the clamour that rose from it was unceasing.
Oui.<eos> I remember in New York... across from us, on the other side of the park... there was this beautiful, old mansion.<eos> It was very elegant, aristocratic.<eos> It made me feel good knowing something so beautiful... was so close.<eos> Around it were lots of other lovely buildings, mostly built, I think... around the turn of the century.<eos> One by one, they went down... and one by one, up went mostly monstrosities.<eos> But that one building remained.<eos> It was there.<eos> Someone said an eccentric millionaire owned it.<eos> At night, as a kid, when I'd walk across the park... I'd use it to guide me.
Thinking of themselves as twins of twins,<eos> Ipson and Pulat believed they possessed charmed lives, took great physical risks, became air couriers and learnt to fly.<eos> They practised parachuting and worked for a circus.<eos> One New Year's Eve they climbed Cologne Cathedral, and for an encore, crossed the Rhine jumping from ice floe to ice floe.<eos> They ended up in the freezing water, and against expectation, survived.<eos> But the Violent Unknown Event abruptly changed their luck.<eos> From now on they were to share only the symptoms of high blood pressure and perfectly synchronised blackouts.<eos> They were obliged to relinquish their pilot's licence.<eos> For Ipson it was not an enormous loss.<eos> Pulat took any chance he could to sit at the controls of a small plane and taxi it in small circles until the fuel was exhausted.
Jesus, Benjamin!<eos> I don't get it. What do you do after a thing like that?<eos> Join the Army.<eos> We're lost.<eos> We've passed that same alligator 7 times.<eos> I bet the war games are over by now.<eos> - Lewis is going to just kill us!<eos> - There's a plane!<eos> I bet that's headed back to base.<eos> Let's follow it.
SPACE MONSTER GAMERA (SUPER MONSTER)<eos> There are 200 Billion stars present in the Milky Way Galaxy. Our sun and its nine planets consist of just one solar system within the galaxy.<eos> There are billions of other such systems within the Milky Way galaxy, many greater than our own solar system.<eos> But, compared to the enormous size of the Universe itself, even a galaxy is but a tiny pinpoint of light.<eos> In our vast Universe there are billions of other such galaxies that are just as big if not bigger than our own.<eos> The Universe is limitless in size, and mankind is not the only creature in it that wages war against itself...
Also, there are references to another planet called Terra...<eos> - Wait a second.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Terra?<eos> Terra in Gemonese means Earth.<eos> That doesn't mean this is the Earth we're looking for.<eos> And what difference does it make?<eos> We've illegally seized an alien ship on an unknown course.<eos> - Illegally seized?<eos> - What do you call taking a ship out of flight and tampering with it until its resources begin to dwindle?
I left for the parcel, came back, and she was already on the 3rd floor... and I know she doesn't' like to be disturbed... so the parcel stayed here, you know?<eos> You're out of here right now, I don't care.<eos> You're out of here right now, I don't care.<eos> You're out of here right now, I don't care.<eos> I don't care!<eos> Ana.<eos> Ana!<eos> "Tonight's show"<eos> "When will this loathsome, tiresome dandruff problem end?"<eos> "Get rid of it with Zp11's Revlon shampoo."
You're right We must respect our dreams.<eos> They separate us from reality's commonplaces and send us to that invisible world... where we can make our wishes come true.<eos> No, no, I'm 'welting.<eos> An extremely rainy day?<eos> No, I'm not interested in the wind direction.<eos> No clear sky? Thank you very much.<eos> it's something I don't get.<eos> Daslow goes up the terrace with a rifle to shoot the president... but now we know that the rifle was not loaded.<eos> - Why would one go up with an unloaded rifle?<eos> Someone replaced it in the last minute.
- Thou art on thin ice! I bid thee obey!<eos> (SQUAWKING) You're in trouble.<eos> Mordred's looking for you.<eos> - I must find the monster and help him.<eos> He cannot defend himself against weapons, that we have seen.<eos> What concern is that of yours?<eos> - Clarence, perhaps he isn't a monster.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> With these eyes, but my heart refuses to accept it.<eos> Come... we must help it escape. Come on, Father.
He wenteth that way.<eos> It's taken refuse in the Great Hall.<eos> - Where it will see its last moments.<eos> It has taken on rust.<eos> I have been putting my lance to use.<eos> Mordred, please, I have a knack for this sort of thing.<eos> Are you going to be long?<eos> You're holding up the midday meal.<eos> I beg your indulgence, sire... .. but my sword and I seem to be at odds.<eos> He seems quite attached to it.
Starbuck's lost a ship.<eos> (Starbuck 'Cree, come in.<eos> Shields, where are you?<eos> '<eos> I got them.<eos> Just inside critical gravitational pull.<eos> Cree, Shields, come back.<eos> You can't go down there.<eos> I saw where it came from.<eos> I'm going after it.
I took a vow of chastity. I took ten vows - a hundred.<eos> How can a man be a holy man when that terrible thing attaches him to the earth?<eos> I got rid of my money, I shed my clothes, I ate a spoonful of rice each day, and my mind began to soar.<eos> I felt the universe.<eos> I was the universe.<eos> And then, that terrible thing summoned me.<eos> "Hello!" it cried.<eos> "Think of the pleasure!"<eos> Several times, I grabbed a knife.<eos> I intended to rid myself of it once and for all.
Years I've never told anyone.<eos> My mum wouldn't understand.<eos> She likes equitation, bowler hats, jodhpurs.<eos> "My uncle dressed for the horse, " she says.<eos> But what does that mean?<eos> ! A horse isn't dressed!<eos> It's naked.<eos> It's the most naked thing you ever saw, more than a dog, a cat, or anything.<eos> Even the brokenest-down old nag has got its life.<eos> Put a bowler hat on top of it, it's filthy.
How horrible. Emil.<eos> Oh God.<eos> Stay back.<eos> No, no. Don't move him.<eos> Emil...<eos> - I'm sorry. - Stay back.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I told him about the gun.<eos> - I told him where it was. - No. No.
He wanted some girls, some guys and some bath salts.<eos> I gave him a card for an escort service and he took off.<eos> Pretty high-end, so good luck getting anything out of them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> (RETCHES)<eos> We gotta go.<eos> We should go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll get it, I'll get it.
This will do you good.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Look here.<eos> Look here.<eos> In the middle of your finger.<eos> Concentrate here.<eos> Breath deeply.<eos> Now move your hand towards your face.<eos> Your hand will get closer...<eos> And when it touches your skin, your eyes will close.
Are you joking?<eos> - No.<eos> It must be a joke.<eos> - I'm afraid it's not.<eos> Are you from "Candid Camera"?<eos> You are from ""Candid Camera"'!<eos> Gosh !<eos> Kati told you to do it, awesome!<eos> You know that you need my permission, right?<eos> You have it.
What the...<eos> Asshole!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> No cash!<eos> Where's your bank manager?<eos> This is a United States court order authorizing us to freeze the accounts of a Victor...<eos> Lugo!<eos> - Open the door!<eos> - Lugo!<eos> 'Open m 'Open it up!
Well, I've been working in the penis industry for 19 months.<eos> I think he lifted weights to try to compensate for the fact that he had a very tiny penis.<eos> It was bent on a 25 degree angle, like a boomerang.<eos> You see, erectile dysfunction is nothing to be ashamed about but being an unfaithful lying shit who I know for a fact tried to finger bang his paralegal in the interview room, that's a little shamey.<eos> But being in the medical profession, I prefer not to judge.<eos> But that lady's a whore.<eos> Yeah, you, you fucking bitch.<eos> No further questions.<eos> The state was very thorough.<eos> Frankly, it had a lotto make up for.
Oh, that's gasoline.<eos> I was filling up the car with gasoline, and then I spilled a little on my pant leg.<eos> That isn't alcohol.<eos> I think I got a meeting here.<eos> You want to wait here or you want to come?<eos> You think you have a meeting?<eos> Let's see.<eos> See? This is fun, right?<eos> When we came into this neighborhood in '92, there was nobody here. It was like a war zone. Hookers, crack...<eos> - Now it's totally gentrified.
Anyway I never liked pine trees.<eos> They're dripy and sticky.<eos> Some things are just meant to die.<eos> How my parents ever fell for each other is a mystery.<eos> They were like day and night.<eos> The human head lice, Pediculus humanus capitis belong to the Anoplura family.<eos> A. N. O. P. L. U. R. A.<eos> T.S., When you drawing the legs make sure you observe not just how many there are but the exact distance between them.<eos> Yeah. The exact distance between them.<eos> Beware of mediocrity. It's the fungus of the mind.
We are not gods.<eos> We are born, we live, we die.<eos> Just as humans do.<eos> Give or take 5,000 years.<eos> All this because Loki desires a throne.<eos> It is my birthright.<eos> Your birthright was to die as a child.<eos> Cast out onto a frozen rock.<eos> If I had not taken you in, you would not be here now to hate me.<eos> If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it.
Are you certain?<eos> The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them, and yet here it is.<eos> The Dark Elves are dead.<eos> Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?<eos> It does not.<eos> [ ELVISH ] The worlds are almost aligned.<eos> You will be the last of the Kursed.<eos> Let my life be sacrificed.<eos> It is no less than what our people did, or what you did.<eos> You will turn into darkness, doomed to this existence until it consumes you.
If they succeed and get to the mainland they will destroy monuments all around the world including the one monument your food storm didn't destroy.<eos> Not Lady Liberty!<eos> I've gotta destroy the FLDSMDFR.<eos> But how?<eos> Well, my Thinkquanauts have invented this.<eos> The BS-USB.<eos> Or BSUSB.<eos> A Bifurcating Systematic Universal Stop Button!<eos> Precisely.<eos> It would destroy the machine and everything it created.
- Flint we should be studying the food animals, not killing them.<eos> What if he's wrong?<eos> The choice is yours, son.<eos> Live up to your full potential or walk away and let the food monsters destroy Lady Liberty.<eos> Sam, finding that FLDSMDFR and saving the world that's what matters.<eos> Really?<eos> Our opinion doesn't matter?<eos> Of course it does!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, it matters.
- But, sir, I didn't think we were going to...<eos> - This is why I work alone.<eos> Monkey!<eos> You are dismissed.<eos> And now, without further ado...<eos> Flint, hurry!<eos> Why won't this go faster?<eos> - Give me that controller!<eos> - Sure, come and get it.<eos> But which one of us has it?
So would I, if anything happened to Walter.<eos> We're made for each other, Jakob.<eos> If only father would see that two people can belong together even if they have different religions.<eos> A Catholic can be just as god-fearing as a Protestant.<eos> Walter is a fine man, and wise with it.<eos> That's such a boon in these terrible times.<eos> Lena...<eos> I'm all set to emigrate.<eos> - What's put that in your head?<eos> - I want to be where the sun goes when it sets here.
Did you see the bashing your brothers gave them?<eos> Who?<eos> The baron's men.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> Hold it up!<eos> Come on, have some more.<eos> It's free today.<eos> Here. Another swig for you.<eos> The fair is over.<eos> It must close down forthwith.
Post scriptum.<eos> We live more than once.<eos> He who has weathered the stormy waves of life will gladly follow me to the thickened forests, through the endless steppes and across the mighty backs of the Andes.<eos> And the worldly spirit will tell him:<eos> In the pursuit of science is freedom.<eos> Father! I have the answer!<eos> - We must build a centrifugal governor.<eos> A centrifugal governor. It's in this book.<eos> Look. "Centrifugal force activates a joint-and-lever mechanism "that throttles the steam pressure when the machine starts running too fast.<eos> "Otherwise it would rotate at maximum speed until it destroyed itself."
You were supposed to take him out, not give him a joyride on the Good Ship Lollipop!<eos> Damn it, I didn't recruit you for your sense of compassion. Machete kills.<eos> That's what he does!<eos> He doesn't save the bad guys!<eos> Now shoot that motherfucker!<eos> If he dies, you die.<eos> The missile is wired to his heart.<eos> Come again?<eos> Machete, can it be disarmed?<eos> Only where it was made.
Think about it.<eos> How old are you?<eos> In your line of work, why have you lived so long?<eos> Your partners knew about self-sacrifice for the greater good.<eos> Not you, though.<eos> You know what you are?<eos> Vengeance.<eos> You are vengeance.<eos> And vengeance never dies.<eos> It only changes targets.
You expect to come to my fucking country, waltz around like you own the bloody place, come between a man and his meal and "just walk away," eh?<eos> Please!<eos> Don't!<eos> You owe me, boy.<eos> What made you think you could just take her away from me, huh? Just wanted to...<eos> Hey? Hey, hey, hey?<eos> Where's your famous English wit, now?<eos> Even harder to be a smartass with no fucking tongue.<eos> There once was a lad from York, who picked his nose with a fork.<eos> And when it got stuck, he cried, "I don't give a fuck,"
Oh, or else that.<eos> Nice try, flame bag, but now you're trapped here with me for the next billion years.<eos> I've saved the entire world!<eos> And no one will ever know.<eos> Uh, yes, hi.<eos> I'm from the vampire bank that burned down.<eos> I have what remains of the contents of a safe deposit box belonging to a Bender B. Rodriguez.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> Bender's medal.<eos> It melted in the fire.
I've tried many times.<eos> Huh?<eos> Bender!<eos> Fry?<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> I used the "Find My Robot" app.<eos> Neat.<eos> What was it, 99 cents?<eos> No, free.<eos> But it's got ads on it.
Huh, I should be mad, but it worked pretty well.<eos> You were really brave, Leela.<eos> And you seriously nailed that thing with your golf shot.<eos> Fry, you saved my ass out there.<eos> Aw, I couldn't let anything happen to something that shiny.<eos> And, Dr. Zoidberg, it was your quick thinking...<eos> Uh, yup.<eos> Bad news, everyone.<eos> The creature is a shape-shifter.<eos> It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes.
Uh, yup.<eos> Bad news, everyone.<eos> The creature is a shape-shifter.<eos> It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes.<eos> I weren't fooled.<eos> The real Professor wun't never've...<eos> Dern.<eos> Bad news, everyone.<eos> The creature is a shape-shifter.<eos> It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes and Scruffy.
No matter how much it looked like you.<eos> Leela, I'm honored, but for your own safety, you shouldn't trust anyone, not even me.<eos> But I'm just so scared.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> Easy, easy, you're biting my lip.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Ow, ow, ow! Wait a second, I know what's going on here.<eos> I'm the monster.<eos> The creature was right behind me.<eos> I don't know where it went.
I mean, why would a fine, upstanding investigative journalist like Anne Roland want to sully an already fragile reputation with bad business like that?<eos> No, it's not like that.<eos> You have to...<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> I've, uh... I've told a few lies in my time, too.<eos> Recently, in fact.<eos> For instance, I told you that the drug was in that blue liquid, which you so discreetly threw in my wastepaper bin.<eos> It's not? No.<eos> No.<eos> It was in the whiskey you just drank.
You'll have a chance to say thank you.<eos> What is it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just that man who caught the parasol.<eos> He seems to be here by himself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'd better go.<eos> No, please stay.<eos> I was giving thanks to the spring.<eos> I asked it to bring you here, to me.
Guide it!<eos> Use it!<eos> How do you feel?<eos> I feel good, I released my Chi.<eos> You must be careful with this, Tiger.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You used power to break the spear, instead of guiding your Chi to evade it.<eos> Tai chi is about balance: the harmony of form and spirit.<eos> But power could also solve the problem.<eos> The choice you made today will not only affect your martial ability, it will also determine the essence of who you will become.
I thought of such a forced membership and such certainty, leaving no doubt since the books, the reasoning the hazards of a restless life could not shake the faith or indeed touch it.<eos> I had, suddenly, the feeling of the innocence the eternal childhood of God... an unspeakable revelation.<eos> I am not a Christian to enjoy the religious sentiment or a kind of mystical pleasure.<eos> I always hated that.<eos> This is why I am a Christian:<eos> I'm a Christian by obedience and by interest to know what's expected of me.<eos> But I've never had the idea to enjoy God to draw enjoyment or any pleasure whatsoever.<eos> I would have considered it to be quite vile, is it not?<eos> It seemed to me that God took to solemnly sitting in my heart.<eos> It reminded me of his past favours... and showed me my vocation, made it known.
No, I don't.<eos> You little sissy boy.<eos> Huh?<eos> It's enough of this.<eos> Sissy boy, huh?<eos> You hard now?<eos> I'm inverted.<eos> Now it's time to give him the Big Chuck show.<eos> No need for the show.<eos> Put it back on.
I don't know it.<eos> You don't know it.<eos> I don't know it.<eos> Really?<eos> What about your family?<eos> What about Morganville, Wisconsin?<eos> Are you telling me that was all bullshit?<eos> No.<eos> There's a great little town.<eos> It's Morganville, it's in Wisconsin.
Sorry.<eos> I'm a brute.<eos> I meant there's nothing worse than you being sick.<eos> We'll get you well.<eos> Can you please tell me what's going on?<eos> I'm not the husband, but I'm on the team, right?<eos> We'll do it together.<eos> Chloe has a water lily in her right lung.<eos> We saw it.<eos> It's quite big but we ought to be able to get rid of it.

Shit.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi.<eos> Could you...?<eos> Could I leave this cat with you?<eos> - With me?<eos> - It's... It's the Gorfeins' cat. Just till one of them gets back?<eos> With me?<eos> It slipped out and I don't have the key.
Could you...?<eos> Could I leave this cat with you?<eos> - With me?<eos> - It's... It's the Gorfeins' cat. Just till one of them gets back?<eos> With me?<eos> It slipped out and I don't have the key.<eos> Could you just keep it till they get back?<eos> I have to run the elevator.<eos> I mean, that's not a problem, is it?<eos> It's the Gorfeins' cat.
Troy Nelson. How are you?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Llewyn Davis.<eos> Hello.<eos> I've heard your music, and heard many nice things about you from Jim and Jean and from others.<eos> You have not heard one nice thing about me from Jean, ever, have you, Troy?<eos> You tell the Gorfeins you'll take care of their cat, then bring him here for us to take care of.<eos> I've heard nice things from Jim and Jean and others. I didn't...<eos> It just happened.<eos> It's a peaceful cat.
I miss Mike.<eos> Can I ask you for a favor?<eos> You're joking.<eos> It's not for me, it's for the Gorfeins.<eos> Their cat got out.<eos> Could you leave the fire-escape window open?<eos> It's winter.<eos> Just enough for the cat to squeeze back in'? It could come back.<eos> To our apartment?<eos> It was there, like, six hours.

Grown man with a cat.<eos> - Is that part of your act?<eos> - No.<eos> - What'd you say you played?<eos> - Folk songs.<eos> Folk songs.<eos> Thought you said you were a musician.<eos> Folk singer with a cat.<eos> You queer?<eos> - It's not my cat.
- No.<eos> Mel Novikoff sent you my record about a month ago.<eos> - Inside Llewyn Davis.<eos> - You're with Mel.<eos> I was, just in Chicago, just,<eos> - Just passing through.<eos> - You like the record?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> I didn't get it.<eos> Well, here it is. It's-
But they got to have vacuums.<eos> Think that was an oriole.<eos> I didn't know we had those.<eos> Wait here.<eos> You didn't wait.<eos> Where's Josh?<eos> He took a walk.<eos> The disaster we see is happening everywhere at the same time.<eos> The clock is ticking.<eos> It has been ticking for 150 years now, since the dawn of industrialization.
Look, you come back here with the proper identification. I'm sure we can work something out.<eos> But until then, I can't help you. I'm sorry. That's just how it is.<eos> You'd sell it to me if I looked like these guys.<eos> I know these guys.<eos> Lucky you don't look like us.<eos> All right, look, sir.<eos> If you want to, you can call my uncle. Nature's Harvest is our name.<eos> We grow carrots, onions, beets, parsnips, broccoli, and we have 120 milk cows that supply for Wilber Dairy.<eos> You probably drink our milk.<eos> I do drink the milk if it's on sale.
"I'm so cramped." Look at my spacious bunk.<eos> - Film me for a second.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay, so this is actually one of two living quarters.<eos> What they do is they rotate around the core module so this gives us simulated gravity.<eos> But watch this. We also get to experience real gravity-free space excitement.<eos> And the head rush that goes with it.<eos> - Crew meeting in one hour, guys.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Now the thing about zero gravity is that it makes our bones and muscles really weak.
Your camera will be repaired, okay?<eos> Finish your video. Hey, we're here for you.<eos> Copacetic?<eos> Tell me a time I've ever let you down before.<eos> All right, can you hurry?<eos> Eve's birthday is tomorrow, so...<eos> Eve Goodwin?<eos> We're doing all this for Eve Goodwin?<eos> Here's the receipt.<eos> Don't lose it.
Dax is chopped up in little pieces in garbage bags in your garage.<eos> I think the last thing that he's concerned about and we should be concerned about is the video.<eos> Big pieces.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Big guy. Big pieces.<eos> Perseverance.<eos> Finish what you start.<eos> Speaking of which, I spoke to Chunk last night while you were busy with that.<eos> And she swears neither her nor her aunt loaded the gun.<eos> It was loaded.
Come on, you got to see this game I just got, it's really cool.<eos> I warned you.<eos> You're so good at that, sounding so righteous.<eos> Yup.<eos> Drawers on the nightstand.<eos> Don't keep me waiting.<eos> Give me the gun.<eos> What the hell are you...<eos> Okay, you're gonna give her the wrong impression, all right?<eos> Where is it?
The Khitan are retreating!<eos> To Wolf Mountain.<eos> To Wolf Mountain!<eos> I really don't understand, General.<eos> You could crush them.<eos> Why are you leaving survivors?<eos> We need someone to report back, don't we?<eos> Come no further, Madam.<eos> Master, I beg leave to ask one question.<eos> The Yang family protects its own as it defends the empire. This is natural.
In.<eos> Up?<eos> Superb.<eos> For my buyers.<eos> The Chinese are great lovers for royal things.<eos> And who knows?<eos> Maybe they even buy you.<eos> Did they hurt you and your children?<eos> Youth is of particular beauty.<eos> Perhaps because it slips away so quickly.
Uh, hey... it was good meeting you.<eos> I called you.<eos> I can't do this every day.<eos> This makes me late for work.<eos> You're four trains after me.<eos> So you're going to have to answer if I call.<eos> I'm going to call.<eos> I picked up an MBA.<eos> That's what the, that's what the firm does.<eos> It has a commercial half, the other side's personal wealth.
- I thought he had the car?<eos> No, the car's a bit of a giveaway.<eos> He walked.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> To cash in.<eos> - Get the gun.<eos> - Why?<eos> Mc'Deer.<eos> He's a tricky customer.<eos> Hand it over.
What?<eos> I can't let you in until Alphonse is home.<eos> Alphonse is on his way.<eos> Where?<eos> In the basement.<eos> Oh, Paulie.<eos> No.<eos> It's Paul.<eos> Why is the alarm off?<eos> I told you that you should always have it on!
The city has been spared the plague for over a century.<eos> Even my father only ever heard speak of it.<eos> But his son may live to see it with his own eyes.<eos> The Imam and his mullahs... have been praying for God's vengeance to punish my extravagance.<eos> I cannot do them that favor.<eos> My lord, hundreds of thousands of your subjects could die.<eos> My people are fruitful, they will survive!<eos> Don't disturb my falcon.<eos> This audience is over.<eos> The plague doesn't care if you're rich or poor... common man or nobleman or head of state but it's reached Ispahan.
Looking for reasons not to go home.<eos> Jesse, I wish you a long and happy life.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> Blessed are you, Lord... sovereign of the universe... who has sanctified us with his commandments... and saved us from the plague.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> To survival.<eos> If the world were just... I should bow to you.<eos> But it is not.
We're going to be respectable.. Pillars of the community from here on end.<eos> And we'll be model mothers-in-laws.. And before you know it, we'll be the perfect grandmothers.<eos> I will never forgive you for this.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> No, darling.<eos> It's going to happen soon or later.<eos> And responsibly and joyfully.. In mutual respect and the promise to be faithful..<eos> Come together in the presence of God.. To witness the marriage of Tom and Marry. And to ask God's blessing on them as we shared their joy.<eos> Marriage is a gift from God, our creator.<eos> It is a symbol of God's unending love for his people.. and of the union between Christ and His church.
What's up?<eos> What's up, matt?<eos> Luke. Get the anchor.<eos> You help him.<eos> Want a beer, matt?<eos> What do I open it with, my teeth?<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm going to ask you some questions, bob.<eos> And I want the correct answer, straight away.<eos> 'cause if I don't think it's correct, I'm going to kill you.
Get him a chocolate.<eos> You all right?<eos> Hello?<eos> Can you take me over paradise?<eos> That's where Tui was last seen.<eos> Delta echo charlie. I'm in laketop looking to go over the double barrel to paradise.<eos> Have you spotted any smoke?<eos> No, nothing yet.<eos> Welcome to paradise.<eos> See this clearing, they call it eden.
Welcome to paradise.<eos> See this clearing, they call it eden.<eos> Look, there's eve as well.<eos> Delta echo charlie, heading north up the dart now.<eos> We'll go over the saddle and come back down the rees, over.<eos> Why weren't you at the search?<eos> There's no point.<eos> There's no point looking for your sister?<eos> Here's her jacket.<eos> Where was it?

But it does no good.<eos> Because life is what it is, and it does what it does, as Gustavsson the merchant found out.<eos> Wait here, baby.<eos> Hurry back!<eos> He'd sneaked away on a well-planned day-trip.<eos> He picked a sunny day, a beautiful road and just the right hill for his pee break.<eos> And still, it all went to hell. I had chosen the same hill for my explosives test.<eos> She screamed to high heaven. I guess that's what mistresses do when merchant heads land on car hoods.<eos> [Screaming Continues]<eos> Even if the test was a success, it did land me in the mental hospital.
God damn it!<eos> What have I done?<eos> - What?<eos> - Bloody hell!<eos> - How could I leave the cold on? - Oh, my.<eos> Yeah, well... it'll work out.<eos> [Allan Narrating] Regret doesn't do you much good, not unless you own a time machine.<eos> You know, regret doesn't undo the thing you regret doing.<eos> And my operation, well, I never regretted that.<eos> On the contrary, it was a real stroke of luck.
Hello, Captain.<eos> I've got something new.<eos> - Now we know where the killer is.<eos> - Hey, wait.<eos> I hereby ask to be involved in the investigation.<eos> Okay, I'll go and arrange it now!<eos> Contact the relevant departments now.<eos> - This information may not be right.<eos> - You set it off in no time.<eos> It might be wrong.
How can you say I don't know? How can you say that?<eos> I want to tell you, this is only one experience in your whole life.<eos> We're meant to experience all of life.<eos> No experience should be wasted.<eos> Do you understand, are you that foolish?<eos> Come here!<eos> Now hold your head up.<eos> Take your gun!<eos> Take it!<eos> Aim it at the red heart!
Hey-<eos> There might be something wrong in your station house.<eos> Go.<eos> If someday I find there's something wrong with you, your whole family will be dead meat.<eos> Don't you know your son is an undercover cop?<eos> Do you know what happens to undercover cops?<eos> Sunny, he is my only son.<eos> He reads little and always makes trouble with others.<eos> For any problems between them, I'll shoulder the responsibility.<eos> Okay, shoulder it for your son now!
There are very wicked people in it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What do you want me to put on this poster?<eos> Madam Zuleika, or Romany Lee, Gypsy Queen?<eos> No one likes gypsies round here.<eos> Better make it Madam Zuleika.<eos> With a snake around her neck.<eos> Snake in the grass.<eos> I had a snake once.<eos> But it swallowed the rabbit.
What is his motive?<eos> - Let me put to you the facts. - Facts?<eos> What facts?<eos> The fact that old John Merdell was the grandfather of Marlene Tucker.<eos> The fact that Lady Stubbs always wore those particular types of floppy hat.<eos> The fact that Marlene Tucker had cosmetics hidden in the back of her drawer and the fact that Mademoiselle Brewis maintains it was Lady Stubbs who asked her to take refreshments to the boathouse.<eos> You call those facts, do you, in London?<eos> You prefer the hard evidence?<eos> Such as the body of Lady Stubbs?<eos> I know where it is hidden and who hid it there.
Then he obtained a post for Monsieur Grant, with the deliberate intention of making him the soaping goat. Then he gave to him a pair of boots, one of two pairs that were duplicate.<eos> The other he kept for himself. Then he drove up outside the house in a van.<eos> Leaving it in full view, he entered the house, committed the murder wearing the boots identical.<eos> Then he drove away.<eos> This man, he wore a hat of straw... and his clothing was slightly bloodstained.<eos> But, Poirot, the whole village would have seen him.<eos> Vrai dire.<eos> Everybody saw him, and nobody saw him.<eos> He drove up in the van of a butcher.<eos> This leg of mutton would not have remained frozen if it was delivered on Saturday.
Why did you go through with this horrid charade, making us believe you were dead?<eos> But it was vital, Miss Lemon, vital that you should believe it.<eos> It was necessary for Poirot to disappear, because in this way, the guard of Number Four, it would be dropped.<eos> George?<eos> I'm sure you had the best intentions, sir.<eos> No man is a hero to his valet.<eos> Can you ever forgive me, mes amis?<eos> It was all for the best I suppose.<eos> But you know this affair of the Big Four, it has done some other good..<eos> Has it not reunited me with all my oldest friends?
No, Mr Waring, please stay here.<eos> We shall not have you implicated.<eos> But...<eos> Now, do sit down.<eos> There, there. There, there.<eos> Tell me what happened, please.<eos> I carried the body to the bathroom.<eos> I stood on the closed lid of the lavatory.<eos> fed the body through the little window.<eos> It went down the mountain.
Because this keeps him in employment. But it is a cover.<eos> But that is the way you behave.<eos> How can one trust either of you?<eos> I told you he was forceful.<eos> And you, Countess.<eos> Never quite able to wean yourself from the life of crime?<eos> Pourrais-je, madame?<eos> Oh, vous voyez, mademoiselle.<eos> Your mother she is wearing the brooch belonging to Madame Rice.<eos> It was ugly on her and it is pretty on me.
But the essence of it, it is correct, oui?<eos> Yes.<eos> And how did you know this story would succeed?<eos> Because it was told to you by your regular fence and accomplice, Dr Lutz.<eos> Whose passport I have here...<eos> And yours, mademoiselle.<eos> And if Poirot compares the two, what does he discover?<eos> He discovers that in the past six months, you have both visited exactly the same countries, on exactly the same dates.<eos> I am concerned that there is in your handbag a gun.<eos> Lieutenant, would you please see if it also contains a book?
I'm sorry.<eos> The reason that we related so well... is that my dad is a recovering alcoholic... - She's a practicing- is a practicing drug addict and alcoholic.<eos> And our moms became, like, best friends.<eos> - We were, and she went off the deep end. - Please!<eos> - So, basically you took her in.<eos> We took her in about six years ago.<eos> But let's, uh- Let's-Let's get back to Nicki, okay?<eos> Uh, so Adam here told me that you do charity work.<eos> Yes. We do a lot of stuff through our church.<eos> - It's called the Agape Church. - It's the religious science philosophy... beneath The Secret.
No, sweetheart.<eos> He's not.<eos> Darling, wait inside for a second.<eos> Mr. Belhatchett... If you can't straighten up for your own sake, do it for your daughter.<eos> Irresponsible.<eos> We share a Celtic soul, you and I.<eos> This world, it's just an illusion, Ginty old girl.<eos> As long as we hold that thought dear, they can't break us.<eos> They can't make us endure their reality.<eos> Bleak and bloody as it is.
This world, it's just an illusion, Ginty old girl.<eos> As long as we hold that thought dear, they can't break us.<eos> They can't make us endure their reality.<eos> Bleak and bloody as it is.<eos> Money.<eos> Money, money.<eos> Don't you buy into it, Ginty.<eos> It'll bite you on the bottom.<eos> I loathe this place, Mr. Russell.<eos> It's bringing up these...
Sorry I'm late, man.<eos> I saw my karate instructor on the way here, and I had to chat with him for a little while to be polite;<eos> that's why—<eos> - Hey, I don't need to know about your life, asshole.<eos> You got the cash?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Of course I got the cash.<eos> - Put it on the ground.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay, now give it to me.
[WHEEZING]<eos> [ALL CHATTERING]<eos> ROBIN:<eos> What happened?<eos> Is he dead?<eos> - No, he's quite alive.<eos> Appears the whole city is having an outage.<eos> Odd that the emergency generator hasn't kicked in.<eos> Aces. My cheapo watch stopped too.<eos> Figure I didn't just buy it.
I'm... really sorry.<eos> Easily.<eos> No time for details. I have work to do.<eos> The roof is leaking. I'm broke. I should be in Norway.<eos> The ladder fell off. - No...<eos> My head is missing. Otherwise, I'm just fine.<eos> You find a hammer and nails there.<eos> My winch has been in the corner since the spring.<eos> I was there for her, like you now.<eos> An old boat winch, but it works.
He equates death with love? No, not love.<eos> Poe equates death with...<eos> Beauty.<eos> Poe believed that art was about beauty and that nothing was more beautiful than the death of a beautiful woman--<eos> "Helen," "Lenore," "Annabel Lee."<eos> And to bereave beauty is...<eos> To elevate one's soul.<eos> Carroll never visited same web address twice, which suggests he's using various URLs.<eos> Who with?<eos> Well, there's the rub. Every time I access an IP address, it mutates.
I can't change what happened.<eos> All I can do, all I want to do<eos> is leave you with this apology.<eos> This note, which started with me telling you that my feelings were".<eos> What the hell could you possibly write that I would be interested in reading?<eos> There's a bit in there about me being your son.<eos> Son.<eos> And as much as I'd like to hurt your feelings and call you names, they're just words, and it wouldn't change a thing.<eos> That's not what this note was for.<eos> Hopefully it has explained why I did what I did and maybe even have you understand.
Look...<eos> If you can get me some Peruvian flake, I'll maybe, possibly think about throwing you in the mix.<eos> One thing of Bolivian flake--done.<eos> Peruvian! Peruvian flake, you fucking moron!<eos> Any country you want.<eos> - Oh, one more thing.<eos> - Anything.<eos> I need you to find me the 1945 Martin D-28 acoustic guitar that used to belong to the childhood friend<eos> I buried a few weeks ago. I'm recording this tribute song for him, and I have to have that fucking guitar.<eos> It was so beautiful.
I got you a statue...<eos> the statue you wanted. - Nice.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Do I get a kiss?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Where did you get this?<eos> - You could put a plant in it.<eos> - What, you don't like it? - It's nice, it's nice.<eos> - Put it right there.<eos> - Put it over here? - Yeah, right there against the wall.
Seasoned crooks swear you only remember two days about your stretch in jail:<eos> The day you get in...<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - ...and the day you get out.<eos> But I'll tell you, those guys, they never been to a Polish prison.<eos> 'Cause, buddy, you don't forget a second of your stay in the Warsaw penal system.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> And you never stop thinking about what you done that got you there, and what you're going to do when you get out.<eos> And who you're going to do it to.<eos> I reckon it takes a betrayal before you realize the real currency in the world ain't money... it's trust.
- I thought we had a 10-32. Ten thirty-two?<eos> You trying to impress me with numbers?<eos> I'll give you an impressive number: 52.<eos> That's the number of millions they said I stole.<eos> I got a number for you: one, as in you help me land this one and you're out.<eos> - On the lives of my kids.<eos> - I've seen your kids.<eos> - You'd be better off without them.<eos> - You're a cunt.<eos> You wouldn't know a vagina if it was four foot tall and staring you in the face.
- Interpol. - All right.<eos> Well, we'll adapt.<eos> OK?<eos> So?<eos> I'm curious to know what kind of game you're running?<eos> I was curious about your game.<eos> We need to get on the same page.<eos> What do we do first?<eos> First, we're gonna need a fake.<eos> - How good must it look?
You say this border station, they inspect everything.<eos> Everything going in, everything going out.<eos> We can't walk in our fake or walk out our original.<eos> So we're gonna get them to take it in for us.<eos> We're going to use our sullied reputation to our advantage for once.<eos> Crunch sets off the bells and whistles.<eos> There's a standard 30-day impound on undocumented art.<eos> And, because it's Crunch, convicted art thief, transporting art without the proper paperwork, they're gonna call the gallery where it was purchased right away, to make sure that it's not stolen.<eos> But it ain't goin' anywhere until Crunch shows up with the proof of ownership, which we've got.<eos> And we know where it's being kept.
You know nothing!<eos> You'll suffer like an animal!<eos> She'll never let you go!<eos> She'll never leave you in peace!<eos> Never! She'll never leave you!<eos> What are you playing at?<eos> You don't look so good!<eos> Your camera is as old as Methuselah!<eos> Perhaps I should confiscate it.<eos> After all, it witnessed the crime.
You'll suffer like an animal!<eos> She'll never let you go!<eos> She'll never leave you in peace!<eos> Never! She'll never leave you!<eos> What are you playing at?<eos> You don't look so good!<eos> Your camera is as old as Methuselah!<eos> Perhaps I should confiscate it.<eos> After all, it witnessed the crime.<eos> - It knew the victim...
But you took your sweet time.<eos> I'm listening, young man.<eos> Did you leave the clinic?<eos> If only you knew how sweet life is when you rid yourself of your obsessions.<eos> I must thank you for taking that camera off me.<eos> You've been taking care of it, I hope.<eos> Take it back.<eos> Well now, young man!<eos> No, no! That would be too easy.<eos> It's your camera now.
Water.<eos> This needs to be cleaned and closed.<eos> What's your name, friend?<eos> Qyburn.<eos> You're lucky to be alive.<eos> Lucky?<eos> The badge looks good on you.<eos> Almost as good as it looked on me.<eos> Are you enjoying your new position?<eos> Am I enjoying it?
Take him to Qyburn.<eos> - Will I die?<eos> - No.<eos> The corruption has spread.<eos> I fear it must be cut away.<eos> The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.<eos> Then you'll die.<eos> You're no maester.<eos> Where's your chain?<eos> The Citadel stripped me of it.
I'm going to take their home away from them.<eos> Can you do it?<eos> I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.<eos> There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.<eos> The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry--<eos> Walder Frey.<eos> He's such a splendid fighter.<eos> Do you have any idea when we might...<eos> I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married.<eos> It should grow quickly.
The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call.<eos> I still dream of that night.<eos> Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.<eos> I dream of the voice from the flames.<eos> Was it a god?<eos> A demon?<eos> A conjuror's trick?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.<eos> And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.
"I don't ever want to die."<eos> I wanted to say to him, "You won't, child.<eos> You won't ever."<eos> I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.<eos> I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.<eos> I saw a vision in the flames.<eos> A great battle in the snow.<eos> I saw it.<eos> And you saw whatever she gave birth to.<eos> I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?
If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Your father's gone.<eos> As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband.<eos> You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.<eos> Could you...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife.<eos> One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever.<eos> Have you ever seen one like it?
You were sent here to kill me?<eos> So why haven't you?<eos> I don't want to.<eos> What do your captains have to say about that?<eos> You should ask them.<eos> Why?<eos> We had philosophical differences.<eos> - Over what?<eos> - Your beauty.<eos> It meant more to me than it did to them.
Not in any way?<eos> Never.<eos> I congratulate you upon your restraint.<eos> But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.<eos> Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.<eos> I wouldn't say that.<eos> True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but... brothers and sisters--<eos> where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.<eos> I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.<eos> Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing.
You got what I need?<eos> Yeah, but we have a problem.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I think he knows.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm being followed by one of his people.<eos> Stay where you're at.<eos> I'm coming to you.<eos> I'm by my yacht.<eos> It's at pier three. Please hurry.
So he offered to turn State's evidence.<eos> Called me and said he had what I needed.<eos> I came down here to pick him up, and they killed him.<eos> Wow. Yeah, they say you can tell a man's insecurity by the size of his boat.<eos> What is it?<eos> Miles loved boats.<eos> One year for his birthday, I had a model yacht made for him.<eos> Even had the maker put Dreamboaon the side of it.<eos> Sure is a beautiful boat.<eos> Yeah, it is.
Your husband spoke of you often.<eos> May I call you Rebecca?<eos> Screw you.<eos> I'll take that as a yes.<eos> Consider this a warning.<eos> Really?<eos> What about?<eos> What'll happen if you don't back off.<eos> I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> We were on that yacht today right before it exploded.
Oh, oh so, oh so!<eos> Which clock is my special clock?<eos> You ask the wrong person, my curious friend.<eos> - But you know all<eos> - Yes, and that is why.<eos> I myself do not like to imagine what might happen to you.<eos> Leave it alone.<eos> Oh ... keep your torches straight.<eos> Very good.<eos> If a clock regulates my schedule then it must be found.
- children, enough for today, yes?<eos> Can, Hannes, Marie and I stick around?<eos> Forget it.<eos> - Karl, we must all stay together<eos> - I need to use the toilet..<eos> right now?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> We will wait for you by the suits of armor Come.<eos> Oh, General Torstensson's watch.<eos> Maybe it determines my time.
And another one!<eos> It's not that you're bad, You just have a big imagination..<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Let's see what time I wake up tomorrow.<eos> I'm so tired.<eos> There was so much happening today.<eos> First, we consider each movement of the clock.<eos> Then we rebuild it part by part and clean and polish it.<eos> The clock must be set precisely for this exact time in preparation for the Swedish Festival.<eos> It gives the signal for the firing of the cannons.
The clock must be set precisely for this exact time in preparation for the Swedish Festival.<eos> It gives the signal for the firing of the cannons.<eos> - That's a lot of work, Uncle Hubert<eos> - Yes, it is ...<eos> Please do not call me by my first name at work.<eos> You're the apprentice I am the master.<eos> Okay, Uncle Master How much time will we need today?<eos> I'm expecting about six ... twelve hours.<eos> If we then set the clock back running<eos> Won't it be set twelve hours behind?
I saw who took the clock.<eos> Aha!<eos> The specter that I told you about.<eos> ghost?<eos> - Karl, tell the truth<eos> - Yes!<eos> . It took the clock all by itself<eos> When it saw me, it flew away.<eos> Karl, now seriously.<eos> If you have the clock, then return it.

Oh ...<eos> Holzinger. the citizens are concerned.<eos> - I understand that, but...<eos> He must be arrested before my appearance in the Swedish parade. the black unknown ...<eos> Don't stare at me like that.<eos> I'm not it.<eos> - Beautiful hat<eos> - This will be a pair of pants..<eos> Karl, I want to again remind you:<eos> If you have the clock then give it back.
Dick's own words.<eos> "Look backward, if you want to gaze into the future."<eos> "That's why it is important to remember our history."<eos> Dick would have been proud.<eos> -Yes, he got his museum in the end.<eos> -Why did the council change their mind?<eos> Evidently, a donation of several hundred thousand crowns was made.<eos> Anonymously.<eos> Did you know that one bottle of champagne was salvaged?<eos> -But it was never found.
You're my only friend.<eos> Imagine Ulf was killed too.<eos> By the same person who killed Ivan and Katja.<eos> - You think it's Peter?<eos> - I don't think he'll give up.<eos> He'll kill all of us, I think.<eos> - I told the rector.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> He wants a meeting to commemorate Katja and Ulf.<eos> It could be at the church.
The door is wide open.<eos> How much would we have to invest to get started?<eos> Hello.<eos> Yes, ma'am?<eos> Does Herr Friedrich Zeitz live here?<eos> - He's out at work!<eos> - Yes, I know, I was just er...<eos> - I was wondering if I could see his apartment?<eos> - His apartment?<eos> It's up there, top floor!
I heard you brown-nosed Mr. Pappas and now Showbiz Junior's got a job.<eos> I used to scoop cones here, and why shouldn't he?<eos> It's a great first job for a kid.<eos> Or lifetime job.<eos> Okay, what are we having?<eos> Becky, what do you want, hon?<eos> Can I have the soft chocolate cup, please?<eos> Here's a word you probably never heard, no.<eos> The machine's busted, princess.<eos> Bummer, it's broken?
It's a great first job for a kid.<eos> Or lifetime job.<eos> Okay, what are we having?<eos> Becky, what do you want, hon?<eos> Can I have the soft chocolate cup, please?<eos> Here's a word you probably never heard, no.<eos> The machine's busted, princess.<eos> Bummer, it's broken?<eos> Like all your dreams?<eos> You know what, it's easy to fix.
No.<eos> A bolo is one of those skinny neckties or one of those things you throw in Argentina.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> No.<eos> In this case, it's a mechanical device and it has this small electric motor with this rather incredible compound gear that retrieves a steel cable.<eos> Battery-driven.<eos> And the cable is made out of some unholy alloy, almost impossible to cut it.<eos> And it's in a loop.<eos> And you come up behind the guy and you drop it over his head and you pull the free end of the cable tight and walk away. No one ever even sees you.<eos> And pulling the cable activates the motor and the noose starts to tighten and it continues to tighten until it goes to zero.
Convince of what, for Christ's sake?<eos> That this is just some sort of coincidence.<eos> They're a pragmatic lot.<eos> They don't believe in coincidences.<eos> They've heard of them, they've just never seen one.<eos> So, what happened to the shipment?<eos> I asked them that.<eos> And?<eos> They said, "Se fue."<eos> It's gone?
- What?<eos> - No.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes, you!<eos> No!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hang on!<eos> Nobody's cutting anyone's leg off.<eos> Listen, Brenda, just take a deep breath, and describe to me exactly what the snake looked like.<eos> It was big, and it had black swirls and dots on it.
I'm James's son. Who?<eos> James Lake.<eos> What about him?<eos> He said you had a room.<eos> Go in there and wait.<eos> Quietly.<eos> I mean it, don't make a sound.<eos> Or I'll kill you.<eos> I was actually having the first good idea I've had for a decade when you rang on the doorbell.<eos> But now it's gone.
Do you have a problem with that?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I love that stuff.<eos> I'm just gonna...<eos> I've just seen the girl who broke my heart three summers ago.<eos> Let's go say hello.<eos> No. Best let sleeping dogs lie. Come on.<eos> Best night of my life.<eos> I always love this area.<eos> It's so bustling and I mean those pictures, full of colour.
Thanks.<eos> Hello.<eos> Was this your house?<eos> Was. Ha ha! Past tense.<eos> Everything's past tense now. Ha!<eos> This is the bedroom, And our bed was on this flat area.<eos> This was your bed?<eos> This was it.<eos> And this was on the back of the bed.<eos> Envision a tall case up on legs, And it had a whole lot of drawers.
What are you talking about?<eos> - This is how people start breaking up.<eos> - My God.<eos> - You just jumped off a cliff. - No, I'm marking this.<eos> This is the day you light the ticking bomb that will destroy our lives.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> First, you don't light a ticking bomb.<eos> You set it. - It has a timer. That's why it ticks.<eos> - Whatever. Well, it's ticking right now.
Oh, they were closed. - Yeah.<eos> We're gonna catch them on the way back when we're going to the airport.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Exactly. - We'll leave early, right? Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What happened to my apple? Your apple...<eos> Right?<eos> - Give me the list.<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> It's in your wallet. In your wallet.
. It'll never happen.<eos> It's only a question about when it's going to happen.<eos> I think I'm gonna feel about it the same way Kasparov felt when they could... - No longer compete with that computer.<eos> - Big Blue.<eos> Right. Nobody thought a computer could beat our best.<eos> "A machine lacks that ineffable human instinct." And then...<eos> You know, and now we can't even compete.<eos> I saw a documentary where they were doing an experiment on a lab rat. And he was wired up... And he could push a switch and have an orgasm.<eos> And so the scientists were sort of laughing at this pathetic little creature... While it ignored his food and water and didn't do anything else.<eos> And eventually it just died.
They vowed never to attend one another's funeral. Oh, yeah.<eos> I kind of like the idea of you attending mine.<eos> - What?<eos> - You know, imagining you in a suit... Clean shaven for once, holding hands with the girls.<eos> I like it.<eos> You're gonna outlive me.<eos> Well, we'll see. Or I guess, one of us will see.<eos> Well, you think you wanna go to the service with me?<eos> - To Texas?<eos> - It's not gonna be in Paris.
What, that you don't love me anymore?<eos> I figured you didn't mean it, but if you did, then...<eos> You're just like the little girls and everybody else.<eos> You wanna live inside some fairy tale.<eos> I'm just trying to make things better.<eos> I tell you I love you, I tell you you're beautiful... I tell you that your ass looks great when you're 80.<eos> - I'm trying to make you laugh. - Okay.<eos> All right, I put up with plenty of your shit.<eos> And if you think I'm just some dog who's gonna keep coming back, you're wrong.<eos> But if you want true love, then this is it.
Beaumont is a just man.<eos> His only mistake was being mistaken.<eos> The country needed defending.<eos> The state need defending!<eos> The King needed defending!<eos> I did that, and I regret nothing!<eos> The rest... the truth...<eos> Don't you know, Commissioner... that the truth is both flexible and ever-changing?<eos> My love...<eos> Your prose, though a little stiff... it warms my heart.
And even his hand.<eos> His hand of flesh and bone.<eos> And he wouldn't dream of, nor did he want, to get rid of that vile harpy who ate away at him.<eos> Now, thanks to his misconduct, which I no longer profit from, I'm not allowed...<eos> Madam.<eos> Would you have any idea as to the whereabouts of the hand?<eos> Is this an important case?<eos> It is, my Lady.<eos> That hand...<eos> Does it still elude you?

Safe until he isn't, right?<eos> As I say, it's just a feeling.<eos> A premonition.<eos> Call it what you will.<eos> A calamity for justice, of course.<eos> Now, we can fret about it, become indignant, write an angry letter to the newspapers or our Members of Parliament.<eos> Won't make any difference.<eos> Emir's evidence is being heard in closed session and that is where it will remain.<eos> It will be presented in accordance with the law, then the evidence will be placed in a box.<eos> The box will then be closed and it will never be opened again.
I've been up all night looking for something bigger than protozoa.<eos> Right. We need something more Selkie-sized to save our home.<eos> This could be it!<eos> Current endangered species list.<eos> Bilby Bandicoots, Southern Cassowaries, Bulmer's Fruit Bats,<eos> Fijian Crested Iguanas, Mahogany Gliders.<eos> There's so many.<eos> It used to be impossible to protect our island, but the law changed two years ago.<eos> So all we have to do is prove there are three or more endangered species on the island and no one can build anything on it.<eos> It becomes a protected habitat.
Come on, to the shops with you.<eos> And you just have to get used to boys taking your daughter on adventures.<eos> I had to.<eos> So, wanna see what's on TV?<eos> - That was meant to be a joke.<eos> - I don't have time for jokes.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Didn't realise this was such a busy time for you.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> This whole island is depending on me to keep it pristine and untouched and you're touching it.
I peeked at your list.<eos> And the map.<eos> But I put two and two together and I think I can help.<eos> Help how?<eos> I don't know exactly, but I'm sure I can do something.<eos> What do you want to do with the animals once you find them?<eos> Take their photo?<eos> Is that what you're using this old Polaroid for?<eos> I love my camera.<eos> It's not old.
Minister O'Hare, I know you have pressing environmental issues here in Brisbane, but I need your help.<eos> It's easy to think of our island as remote, disconnected, inconsequential even.<eos> But, uh...<eos> It's funny, my daughter, she likes to make fun of me.<eos> She thinks I'm only interested in protozoa, it's this single-cell organism.<eos> But protozoa's the key to understanding more complex species, entire ecosystems.<eos> It's easy to spot change more quickly in a single cell.<eos> It gives you time to react, time to make changes before it's too late.<eos> And our island, it's like a single cell.<eos> It's a litmus test.
Afraid I'll have to postpone.<eos> Regrets.<eos> Oh, well...<eos> Well, you are reasonably hot.<eos> What say you ditch the... forehead here, and interrogate me?<eos> What say you just stay here and answer our questions?<eos> Sexy... ask me anything.<eos> Well...<eos> This is the man who is supposed to help us save the world?<eos> Don't tell the world, it will panic.
Pete, we have Baudin's map.<eos> - You do? - We do? Well, the place that we... work for... does.<eos> Nicolas Baudin, he was a French explorer.<eos> Most people don't know that he charted the French catacombs... before he left on his famous Australian expedition.<eos> No, most people don't.<eos> We could have Mrs. Frederic scan it and send it to us.<eos> She is our...<eos> - Boss!<eos> - Boss!<eos> I know Baudin's map, but don't... unfortunately, it's just meaningless blather without the legend.
Mrs. Frederic warned Leena to get out, but she stayed to help Artie.<eos> And you... you knew the world needed saving even... if it cost you the only father you've ever known.<eos> The fight... that's what matters.<eos> Lovely. But you are asked to go.<eos> - This is not good.<eos> - Oh, it's so bad.<eos> Since you won't go out, I'll see to it that you make no farther progress.<eos> What was that you're saying about knocking out... one evil and another one popping out?<eos> Good news is I was right.<eos> This disease is not spreading it has spread.
What was that you're saying about knocking out... one evil and another one popping out?<eos> Good news is I was right.<eos> This disease is not spreading it has spread.<eos> Those are words of Dr. Vanessa Calder from the CDC in Atlanta.<eos> The illness, which only a few hours ago was thought... to be simply dehydration confined in Europe... has quickly spread to virtually every corner of the globe<eos> The CDC is classifying the outbreak as a world wide pandemic the fastest to have been declared as such... in the agency's history.<eos> We'll be covering this crisis around the clock.<eos> Stay with us.<eos> Wait, the legend is here?<eos> You said it was in a collection.
We had family all over Europe.<eos> Not so much anymore, but we still remember.<eos> Do you see me?<eos> - And this is your mother? - Oh, Mama.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> And what about this gentleman here?<eos> Oh, was my uncle, Tavis.<eos> He had the same condition as Talan, only he died before it became too severe, in the war.<eos> Uh, what can you tell us about this condition?<eos> Well, it's sometimes passed down to the men in our family.
- (WHISPERS) God, he's got a gun!<eos> What?<eos> Don't advertise it to the whole flipping restaurant!<eos> Why have you got a gun and why have you brought it to dinner?<eos> - (JERRY) Are you crazy?<eos> Me? - Kate, Richard, talk to him.<eos> - Jerry, actually, why have you got a gun?<eos> It's a replica. Calm down.<eos> We just thought it was a good idea, that's all.<eos> It's a real one, actually. They didn't have any replicas left.
Fyodor!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Keep moving, I'll be right behind you.<eos> Go!<eos> Here, kitty, kitty.<eos> Please.<eos> Please! You're not well!<eos> I know, and the gun is heavy.<eos> Here...<eos> Let me rest it.
Wait, where are you going?<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Okay, the 19th at 4pm, then.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good bye.<eos> Ms. Mochizuki.<eos> Where is the camera?<eos> Let me see ix.<eos> Later.<eos> What did it capture?
And yet he speaks of peace!<eos> - I don't know what is in his mind.<eos> - Well, then, maybe you should ask him.<eos> Let me make a suggestion.<eos> Why don't you send one of your men back so he can put to King Horik my ideas for a remedy?<eos> If you think that will work.<eos> Good.<eos> Your messenger will take several days.<eos> So, in the meantime, why don't you and your men go and visit our famous ash tree?<eos> It is famous not only for its size, but because it never loses its leaves, summer or winter.

The President should at least sit down with him and let him make his case.<eos> You tell Bob I'm happy to schedule a meeting with the President once he's set a date to put this bill on the floor.<eos> The President can fuck himself.<eos> This is the platform.<eos> It's what he ran on.<eos> I don't give a shit what he ran on.<eos> He can't steamroll the House.<eos> And don't forget, you work for me, Frank, not him.<eos> If he wants something on the floor, he's gonna have to talk to me directly.<eos> I know you take a lot of pride in your manhood, Bob, and it's impressive, but as big as it is, Linda can still shut the door on it.
No, what we need is one name.<eos> One person who can deliver 12.<eos> The Black Caucus.<eos> Womack.<eos> What can we offer him?<eos> What does he need?<eos> Let me pull up his file.<eos> Here we go.<eos> McCuddin Airforce base employs 3,000 people in his district.<eos> It's on the DOD's chopping block this year.
- I'm not.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Nothing. Can I get more than two words out of you?<eos> I'm just trying to relax.<eos> Claire,<eos> I love you.<eos> Did Zoe expect me to twiddle my thumbs until her arrival?<eos> Perhaps she's making the mistake thinking her time is as valuable as mine.<eos> Proximity to power deludes some into believing they wield it.<eos> I put an end to that sort of thinking before it begins.
Yes, sir.<eos> We don't have the money, Frank.<eos> The legal bills alone will kill us.<eos> How about a settlement?<eos> I'll look at the numbers.<eos> What's it look like to you?<eos> Like a peach.<eos> No, I mean, what does it really look like?<eos> As mayor, I stick with a peach.<eos> As a private citizen, well it looks like the sun is shining where it shouldn't be.
If it will bring you any satisfaction.<eos> I asked the reverend once,<eos> "What are we supposed to do in the face of so much senseless pain?"<eos> And he said to me,<eos> "What else can we do "but take what seems meaningless, "and try to make something meaningful from it?"<eos> He's right.<eos> That's how God works through us. Will you let me work for you?<eos> What you have to understand about my people is that they are a noble people.<eos> Humility is their form of pride.<eos> It is their strength. It is their weakness. And if you can humble yourself before them, they will do anything you ask.
Search him.<eos> In my back pocket.<eos> Did you make a copy?<eos> I didn't have time, you fucking...<eos> Talk, I'm listening.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> - You are sick.<eos> - Be quiet, please.<eos> What's the use of having a gun, if it's not loaded?
-No, but...<eos> It sucks that you are leaving.<eos> Doesn't leave much time for us.<eos> -I have an idea for your party. -Do you?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Everybody thinks it's easy, but it's not.<eos> Building a wall has to be well planned in advance.<eos> It's not just a brick, cement, another brick and more cement.<eos> We tell ourselves that... in 100 years this wall will still be standing.<eos> It must protect our children.

- Hi.<eos> Listen, thanks for coming in, mate.<eos> You liked the tape, yeah?<eos> The tape?<eos> - The tape I sent you.<eos> - The tape!<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!<eos> - Yes.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> - Love it.
The enemy!<eos> Cyberman!<eos> Get down!<eos> # Dr. Who 7x12 # Nightmare in Silver Original Air Date on May 11, 2013<eos> No need to panic, my young friends. We all know there are no more living Cybermen.<eos> What you are seeing is a miracle - the 699th wonder of the universe.<eos> As displayed before the Imperial court, and only here to destroy you - at chess!<eos> Careful now.<eos> An empty shell.<eos> And yet it moves.
Even one Anti-Cyber Gun is a miracle.<eos> These things are hand-pulsars.<eos> Touch the back of a Cyberman's head, the electromagnetic pulse deactivates it.<eos> What's this for?<eos> Just a mad guess here - it blows up the planet?<eos> Implodes it.<eos> There's also a trigger unit.<eos> I'll have that, then.<eos> Is there any other way to activate the bomb?<eos> It's set to respond to MY voice.
They're fine. Right now their brains are just in stand-by mode.<eos> That is not fine!<eos> Listen, right now, they have a better chance of getting out of all this alive than you do.<eos> Which one of you said that?<eos> Me. Cyber-Planner. Mr Clever.<eos> Now, if you don't mind, I have a chess game to finish.<eos> And YOU have to die - pointlessly and very far from home.<eos> Toodle-oo.<eos> Apparently there are more Cybermen on the way.<eos> There's at least a dozen more shots left in the gun before it needs to recharge.
What do we do? I don't want to be Emperor.<eos> If I activate that bomb, it's all over.<eos> And if you don't, three million Cybermen will spread across the galaxy.<eos> Isn't that worth dying for?<eos> Doctor... Three million Cybermen!<eos> The bomb, the throne, it's all connected.<eos> I just have to say, "This is Emperor Ludens Nimrod Kendrick, called Longstaff the 41st,<eos> "the defender of humanity, imperator of known space.<eos> "Activate the Desolator." And it's done.<eos> It'll blow in about 80 seconds.
A nightmare. It's all we have.<eos> You're a pain.<eos> I go all out, then you come and say... "Adèle hates oysters."<eos> I'll have other stuff. The entree too? No problem.<eos> - Even jumbo shrimp?<eos> - Especially. No biggie.<eos> Perfect occasion to initiate her. It's fine.<eos> Like at the school cafeteria.<eos> You squeeze lemon on the oyster.<eos> And usually, if it's really good and fresh, it moves.

And also... culture.<eos> Tell us about yourself.<eos> We want to know about your life, what you want to do.<eos> I want to teach.<eos> Nursery school.<eos> I love kids.<eos> You love kids.<eos> Have you always wanted to teach?<eos> It's not that I loved the school system, but school means a lot to me. It's taught me a lot.<eos> It helped expose me to things that my parents or friends didn't show me.
Meeting? - But...<eos> I felt something wasn't right when I woke up this morning.<eos> Like something bad might happen...<eos> Please stop!<eos> - You're scaring me!<eos> Hello, good morning!<eos> Good morning!<eos> I'm the director, Yoko Taniguchi.<eos> Is that camera already rolling?<eos> Yes it is.
Screw the bus.<eos> I got a car.<eos> Great!<eos> That'll be much more comfy.<eos> Micaela.<eos> Yes.<eos> His camera.<eos> Yes.<eos> He gave it to me when he was sick.<eos> I think you should have it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
My name is Neal Sampat, and I'm with ACN, and I'd love to observe the meeting.<eos> No journalists.<eos> No exceptions.<eos> Do you mind if I ask a question?<eos> Question?<eos> Why wouldn't you want to get the word out about the sit-in on the 17th?<eos> I'm John, and we don't call it a sit-in.<eos> Why wouldn't you want to get the word out?<eos> We do, we just don't need your help to do it.<eos> We want to make sure, no offense, our message is clear before it's distorted by the press.
"On September 17th, we want to see 20,000 flood<eos> "into Lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, "peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street." Then what?<eos> We stay until our demands are met, the arrest and prosecution of the people responsible for the crash, the formation of a presidential commission to investigate corruption in politics, the ratification of a constitutional amendment outlawing the legal designation of "corporate personhood."<eos> You're gonna sleep in a park until a constitutional amendment is ratified by three-quarters of the states?<eos> We mean business, Neal.<eos> What's with the hand signals?<eos> It's a Quaker tradition, and a peaceful way of maintaining order when your movement has no leaders.<eos> Doesn't a movement need leaders?<eos> We believe in a horizontal structure.<eos> Are you worried that the horizontal structure is gonna give power to people who shouldn't have it?
Listen, I told you, you're never gonna see those babies.<eos> I promise you.<eos> I'd like to make you an offer.<eos> I keep primary custody of the children, but you can see them every day.<eos> You screw over my son and then you want to make an offer?<eos> You certainly are your father's daughter.<eos> My father thinks... And I agree with him... That since we were married when you created Ewing Energies, that I should get a part of it.<eos> I would like 30% of your ownership.<eos> You must know that if we go to divorce court...<eos> Our marriage was a fraud and it will be annulled.
We have weapons.<eos> We own the day.<eos> Vampires don't stand a chance.<eos> Ah! Only one can lead us.<eos> I choose you.<eos> Drink the blood.<eos> Russell Edgington is gonna keep coming for me.<eos> We have to fight!<eos> - I have an idea.<eos> - Will it work?
But it's more fun to keep it a little complicated.<eos> Complicated?<eos> Christian, what are you doing?<eos> Where are you going with this?<eos> Just being transparent, baby.<eos> Being transparent about what?<eos> You know that phone app, amore?<eos> It's kinda like a girlfriend finder.<eos> Yeah-I mean no.<eos> It makes... Things simple.
His grandparents own like half of thousand oaks.<eos> She's beautiful, tara, don't you think?<eos> She's okay.<eos> Don't go there, babe.<eos> I'm not doing that with you.<eos> Doing what?<eos> That whole "is that girl prettier than me?" thing you do.<eos> I mean, why are you asking me that?<eos> Look, you never even mentioned her. You never told me about her for a year. You didn't even mention her by name.<eos> It was just "christian's girlfriend."
Can you please stop treating me like I'm made of glass or cobwebs or something?<eos> All right?<eos> I'm dead.<eos> My health and wellbeing has pretty much bottomed out.<eos> So what am I supposed to do?<eos> I don't know, just treat me like an equal.<eos> - Treat me like a bloke.<eos> - But you're a lady.<eos> And me dad taught me how to treat ladies.<eos> Always be polite and courteous, if a lady came in the room, you stood up and took off any hats and if it was a vampire, you staked them.
Well, almost.<eos> It was like my whole life got turned upside down.<eos> - Head rush! - I was just...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I am wonderful!<eos> I've always wanted a nose.<eos> So cute.<eos> It's like a little baby unicorn. But...<eos> I love it even more.
Yes, I did.<eos> I don't like him one bit.<eos> Which is partially a joke.<eos> Really rubbed me the wrong way.<eos> But nonetheless, I'm going to introduce him.<eos> Please welcome<eos> Gustav Warner, everybody.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tonight, one voice transcends the very generation it represents.
You got any pictures?<eos> On your phone?<eos> Come on. Let's cut the shit, Pete, will ya?<eos> What are we gonna do about the shipyard?<eos> BRAC had their hearing.<eos> They slated it for closing.<eos> Yeah, and why didn't you testify?<eos> We're talking 12,000 jobs here.<eos> My hands were tied, Paul.<eos> People wanted it closed.
Congratulations.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Look at this bombshell!<eos> Melita says they're on their way.<eos> It's so warm. ...for 2 years. 200 francs a month!<eos> But tonight we live it up! Champagne, music!<eos> That campaign is really absurd.<eos> Everyone loves it.<eos> Louise loves it.<eos> If Louise loves it...
Like, of course, he doesn't even know what I'm talking about.<eos> You know, I said to him,<eos> "With everything that's going around right now,<eos> I really think that you should have a bottle of hand sanitizer at all times on the counter for the patrons to use."<eos> - Yeah, it's a pharmacy. - Right?<eos> That's, like, a no-brainer, right?<eos> And, of course, like, blank stare. No idea what the heck I'm talking about.<eos> And I said to him, you know, "I'd be really happy to buy a bottle so that you can just put it out there right now for everybody to use, because strep is going around."<eos> - Just do it.<eos> - Again. - Oh, God. - It's going around again.
Hi.<eos> Good morning.<eos> - Do you still like chocolate?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Do you like it here?<eos> Yes, it's fine.<eos> My school's good.<eos> Really?<eos> Is it far from home?
- An ear infection, again.<eos> And how are you?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> They threw me a little party at the office, for my retirement.<eos> All my friends were there.<eos> Did they get you a present?<eos> They spoiled me.<eos> They got me a camera.<eos> It seems to be hard to operate.<eos> It has a zoom, too.
Exciting music starts.<eos> Screeching, high loud.<eos> Panicky scream.<eos> Waiting, here I come!<eos> I go get the drill!<eos> Deep, dark loud the creature.<eos> The creature ceased.<eos> Sweet, female vocals.<eos> (Harald: ) end time is here.<eos> Since we have worked a hundred years on it and now it's there.
They put up a fence?<eos> Seems like the place got to be kind of a tourist attraction.<eos> Kids breaking in. The neighbors complained, so the bank put up a fence.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry about last time.<eos> It should go better now.<eos> I watched a couple of YouTube videos.<eos> It's all about finding the vein.<eos> Give it to me.
Until we catch you.<eos> Walt, just say the word and I'll take you on a ride-along.<eos> You can watch us knock down a meth lab, huh?<eos> Get a little excitement in your life.<eos> Someday.<eos> Welcome to The Grove.<eos> Would you like to see a menu?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.<eos> All right, you got it.
♪ if I show you then I'll know you won't tell what I said ♪<eos> ♪ 'cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead ♪ ♪<eos> He's here to install the new alarm.<eos> Sorry, babe.<eos> I didn't think they'd get to the second floor until after you left for school.<eos> You're putting an alarm on my window?<eos> On every window.<eos> Your mom wants the best system around.<eos> There's an app where I can turn it on remote from my phone.<eos> So how will I know when it's on?
Thank you Yes.<eos> You owe me a favor.<eos> I owe you all night long. Really?<eos> I thought you were 5 minute type.<eos> Status Steakleys troops?<eos> They are under heavy attack. much to go undetected.<eos> Have they found the girl?<eos> unclear, but we may have a bigger problem, Colonel.<eos> Have they fired the missile?<eos> Negative, but it seems to be detonated.
For what it's worth, Colonel, it worked.<eos> Your unit bought us the time we needed.<eos> And the spy never learned the real plan.<eos> Where's your father?<eos> He should have set the charges already.<eos> He should be out anytime.<eos> You see what our great allies, the Volm, are doing now?<eos> Using our own soldiers as sacrificial lambs?<eos> It's funny 'cause I don't see any of them out here dying with us.<eos> Put a sock in it and keep moving, Pope.
'Her house.' And the number you called on - that's the house telephone, is it?<eos> 'Yes.' Good.<eos> Help is already on its way.<eos> Are you with your sister now, Marion?<eos> 'I'm in the hall.'<eos> Where is your sister?<eos> 'She's in the bedroom.<eos> Please help me!<eos> ' Help is already on its way.<eos> It's going to be there very soon.
Have you had someone following me?<eos> Cos there was a car on my tail coming here just now.<eos> Nothing to do with me.<eos> You swear?<eos> I swear.<eos> I'm going to have to caution you, Rob.<eos> What are you doing, arresting me? We want to get this sorted.<eos> Are you carrying a firearm?<eos> No.<eos> Where is it?

We want to get this sorted.<eos> Are you carrying a firearm?<eos> No.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Er, it's in my desk drawer. I had someone check your desk drawer.
Did you pay her?<eos> Pay her?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry I had to call her.<eos> I couldn't get through to you and there was no-one else.<eos> Baby Girl Mitchell died.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh?<eos> Mummy, I can't find my necklace.<eos> Well, it has to be somewhere.
How are you?<eos> I did not know that it was such.<eos> I'll never do it again.<eos> He ​​can not force me.<eos> It was not God.<eos> - I would look for the little guy.<eos> - He's better.<eos> I have lasagne with.<eos> Eat it before it is bad.<eos> It is vegetarian.
- It was sweet of you.<eos> - I heard someone in the shed before.<eos> It was enough father.<eos> He is the only one authorized to be there.<eos> It sounded like a crying girl.<eos> I do not know what you think you heard, but you're wrong.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Thank you for the food we receive.<eos> Blessed are paralyzed, it is his gift.
Did you have soup? We did.<eos> It was delicious.<eos> So what are you doing there?<eos> Are you smoking again?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Did you take your pill?<eos> - I forgot.<eos> - Of course you did!<eos> If I'm not there to remind you, who will?<eos> Take it now and eat something solid beforehand.
We have to go home, okay?<eos> It's the right--<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm good.<eos> I'm good. - You just broke the wall.<eos> What is this wall made out of? It's like...<eos> It just disintegrated.
It's the right--<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm good.<eos> I'm good. - You just broke the wall.<eos> What is this wall made out of? It's like...<eos> It just disintegrated.<eos> It's made out of rocks, man. Are you-J?
Your badge, too.<eos> Am I suspended, sir?<eos> You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?<eos> Sir, I realize that...<eos> Do you know how this reflects on me?<eos> That one of our men could be so careless?<eos> Not only do you abandon your post for coffee.<eos> You could've killed a bystander.<eos> That slug was found on somebody's front stoop.<eos> What if it went in their house?
No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> But if you want, I could talk to her.<eos> You think she would go for it?<eos> Honestly, I don't know.<eos> She's got this sort of anti-establishment "fuck you" attitude.<eos> Conventional news bores her.<eos> But if you had something gritty to show...<eos> I've got a story if you want it.<eos> It's pretty fucking great.
The bigger that number gets, the more it frightens me, because I know all it takes is one drink to go back to zero.<eos> Most people see fear as a weakness.<eos> It can be.<eos> Sometimes for my job, I have to put fear in other people.<eos> I know that's not right.<eos> But if I'm honest, like the fourth step asks us to be, I have to be ruthless, because failure is not an option.<eos> The same goes for my sobriety.<eos> I have to be ruthless with myself.<eos> I have to use my fear.<eos> It makes me stronger.
And I want to talk about the shipyard.<eos> I got a plan to fix it.<eos> You don't want everything going into the Roth IRA.<eos> Five, ten grand a year, and I'll set you up with a nice diversified package, low risk, high yield.<eos> I think Claire and I have things pretty well under control.<eos> If I brought a senior U.S. Congressman into the fund, that would really up my stock in the company.<eos> What're you all gabbing about back there?<eos> We were talkin' about the old library.<eos> Yeah, what's happening to it?<eos> They gonna tear it down?
Who's watching your fucking kid, huh?<eos> Who's watching your kid?<eos> Your girlfriend?<eos> She got a babysitter?<eos> Or is she at home all by herself, just waiting on you to come tuck her sorry ass in and read her a bedtime story?<eos> What the fuck!<eos> You're dead!<eos> Motherfucker!<eos> When I get home, I am gonna tell my girl a bedtime story.<eos> This is how it ends.
We work for Mr. Rabbit.<eos> Sweet fuck.<eos> The guy you're looking for came in a couple of days ago.<eos> - And what did he want?<eos> - Just the usual, man.<eos> Credit cards, ID's.<eos> - I'll tell Mr. Rabbit whatever he wants but I've no idea.<eos> Okay, okay, okay!<eos> I'll get the file!<eos> It's in the safe.
I sent you the check for the cottage for the summer.<eos> What was your last name again?<eos> Baxter.<eos> Tommy Baxter.<eos> Baxter.<eos> Check bounced.<eos> I rented it to someone else, they're coming in next week.<eos> So you guys gotta get the hell out of here.<eos> You what?<eos> I rented it to someone else.
Chuck!<eos> Jack.<eos> Chuck.<eos> What happened?<eos> Two men, in the woods.<eos> The kids saw them kill somebody.<eos> What?<eos> They could be anywhere. I told them to run.<eos> Have you got all your gear?<eos> It's in the truck.
Ah, beg my pardon, Ava, but what's the difference?<eos> It's Ava.<eos> And... depends whose side you're on.<eos> I thought we hired Ava for her expertise, not her politics.<eos> Now, if there's nothing else?<eos> There is actually.<eos> The new model of prosthetic arms... is ready for testing... thought you might like a sneak peek.<eos> - Hello.<eos> The skin's a spider-silk weave.<eos> It's bullet-, bomb- and fireproof... but indistinguishable from human skin to the touch.

And every morning we'd sit on these cliffs... and watch the sun rise over the sea.<eos> Sounds like happiness.<eos> What happened last night?<eos> I killed a man.<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you kill him?<eos> Because I didn't want to die.<eos> We've created something incredible.<eos> This machine has the potential to be so much more than just a soldier.<eos> It's a few steps up from my talking toaster.

Give me some proof.
Nick, if I wanted you dead, don't you think I could have done it the second you turned the key?<eos> How do I know you won't kill her?<eos> Because if I did that, you wouldn't have any reason to play, now, would you?<eos> Decide.<eos> You have ten seconds.<eos> Move it.<eos> Move!<eos> All right, I'm here.<eos> Disarm the bomb.<eos> Disarm it, God damn it!
- There's nothing here.<eos> - Of course there is, Nick.<eos> Now, listen to me, when you find it, bring it with you.<eos> Now... the clue to round five will be waiting for you in the hotel parking lot in the car parked right next to Tommy boy's.<eos> Tick, tick, tick.<eos> Round five's about to start.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What am I supposed to be looking for?<eos> What am I bringing to the parking lot?<eos> Hey, you know, Nick, isn't it funny how sometimes we can't see the very thing that will help us, even though it's staring us right in the face?
Every time.<eos> That's amazing!<eos> - Hi, you've reached Helen.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> - Well... You're still not answering.<eos> Alas I am left only with my thoughts.<eos> I had a dream last night.<eos> I dreamt of us living by the sea.<eos> There was the afternoon barbeque, three little children running around.<eos> I saw our future last night, and it was perfect.
Well, he started to make me joy.<eos> - Joy?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It was in the last days, almost like earlier.<eos> Mm, yes.<eos> Earlier.<eos> Like earlier.<eos> All of us went to the sea and we traipse around in the resin.<eos> - Because the air is so healthy there.<eos> - Well, it is.
- We come from Rome.<eos> - Has the Pope sent you to drag me to Spain?<eos> Or do you finally wish to revenge the death of your soldier, Pedro Caldes?<eos> My army must go to Venice, where the Turks attack.<eos> Naples is the best harbor from which to launch our troops, and since you are the only cardinal in residence... we wish the sacramental, nothing more.<eos> Your brother Juan killed your brother Pedro Luis to feed his desires.<eos> You killed Pedro Caldes to defend your sister's honor.<eos> Silence.<eos> The union of man and woman... is not a crude animal desire... nor an evolving social mandate.<eos> It is a necessity of nature.
Storm off into silent treatment!<eos> Must be me.<eos> Say, have you met this Ophelia character?<eos> Oh, she is a fucking fruitcake.<eos> I know.<eos> She slapped me.<eos> Oh, you think that's bad?<eos> She had me in a fucking cock cage.<eos> What is a cock cage?<eos> It traps your penis in its flaccid sta--
That's what this boy needs, some discipline.<eos> - A little mother's discipline.<eos> - Mommy's discipline.<eos> Okay, now, just give me the gun.<eos> Give Mama the gun.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> There we go.<eos> Why did you hit me?<eos> It's not even fucking loaded, you pussy.
You don't find this kind of workmanship anymore, especially in those bolt-'em-together things.<eos> Simple design, yes, but very complex engineering.<eos> Think it was Leonardo Da Vinci who said, "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."<eos> Hah! That guy was a grave-robber.<eos> Nothin' sophisticated about that, just plain screwy, if ya ask me.<eos> Glitches happen.<eos> Old or new.<eos> Gotta keep up with the times, Cece.<eos> Pretty soon, these DC-3s are gonna be on their way to the aviation graveyard.<eos> This machine has been in the air since before world war friggin' two, and it's still going strong.
Thank you.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Oh, I think I got this hormonal paradigm shift going on right now.<eos> Was she looking at me funny?<eos> We've grown accustomed to people looking at us funny.<eos> Yeah, but you are funny looking.<eos> ~ not just a pizza, yum, yum ~ all right, I gotta run.<eos> You can have the rest.<eos> Our diet precludes pizza.<eos> All right, well, save it.
I'm authorizing you to tell him the truth.<eos> Come on, tell him he's delusional.<eos> It's true, Qohen.<eos> Your phone call's a delusion.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> I was programmed to leave your peculiar pathology untreated.<eos> All right. Thanks, babes.<eos> See you. But I didn't...<eos> The truth ain't pretty, q.<eos> But like my old man says, it'll set you free.
There is no second cardinal.<eos> Refuse again and find out.<eos> First fruits are bitter fruits... Eminence.<eos> I have decided the most righteous act is to vote on your behalf.<eos> What a great and grand surprise.<eos> Despite my uneven relationship with your father... I have always admired you, Cesare. Your pluck.<eos> You have an odd way of demonstrating admiration.<eos> Still, by my calculations, you are a few votes short.<eos> What a pity after all of your strain if you do not garner the tally you need.<eos> I appreciate your concern, dear new friend... but it is born out of your own desires.
Come on, get your stuff.<eos> Let's go, baby.<eos> Bye, Mommy. I love you.<eos> I love you too, sweetie.<eos> What's up..?<eos> I literally just walked in the door. What did I do?<eos> You missed her talent show.<eos> No, I didn't miss it.<eos> That's, like, next Thursday.<eos> No, it was last Thursday.
Cale, they're in heavy weapons followup.<eos> What do you mean, "heavy weapon"?<eos> You gotta be kidding me right now!<eos> Move!<eos> Oh, my goodness! The presidential limo.. has just burst onto the South Lawn!<eos> So sorry.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the Cabinet..<eos> it's with a heavy heart..<eos> Sir, you have to see this!<eos> It's trying to make its way around the South Lawn fountain.
No one can help you now, Lisa.<eos> Just go to sleep.<eos> Go to sleep, now.<eos> Hello, Lisa.<eos> You just won't let go of Olivia, will you?<eos> Such a plucky girl.<eos> You know, you were the same way when you were alive.<eos> Trying to save your family from me, trying to fight the tide.<eos> And yet here we are, the two of us, and it ends the same.<eos> History doesn't repeat itself. It rhymes.
Oh, God. Yeah.<eos> There's something...<eos> I mean, if I... if I were gonna see you again... I'd want you to be a little...<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to hurt your feelings.<eos> Tell me. But just maybe... Stronger, maybe?<eos> Do you know what the KGB is?<eos> I've heard of them. Well...<eos> Well, this weekend, I am giving $100,000 cash to a KGB defector who's coming to town to...<eos> The Reagan administration revealed today that after a month-long review, it will honor the agreement with Iran that led to the release of the 52 American hostages.
The Reagan administration revealed today that after a month-long review, it will honor the agreement with Iran that led to the release of the 52 American hostages.<eos> So... FBI have the car description with the D.C. plates.<eos> They haven't connected it to a stabbing victim at Arlington Methodist yet, but I don't think it will be long.<eos> They're all over our guys at the embassy, who must have made the surveillance, which is why they can't get out to pick up my message or respond.<eos> So, I think we have to assume, with the feds all over them like that, they're on full operational stand-down.<eos> We should just take care of him ourselves. What's the rush?<eos> On an operational stand-down, we're authorized to make our own decisions.<eos> Yes, but why do you want to kill him so badly?<eos> I want him out of my house! He's putting us all in danger, and they're just gonna kill him back in Moscow anyway.<eos> I think we should at least try and finish the mission the way it was assigned.
Forgive me for deserting you.<eos> There.<eos> All is forgiven.<eos> Now we will rescue the infant.<eos> Take us to this farm.<eos> A word, Herr Burchard.<eos> - Release the papal scribes from service.<eos> - But no. The church relies upon this office replicating important documents... issuing Papal Bulls...<eos> The future's not in quills but in typeface.<eos> - You may set it down right here.
I've been hearing that a lot today.<eos> Aw, shit.<eos> I'll-<eos> - I'll give you a lift.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - To where?<eos> I know it may not seem this way, but your father loves you very deeply.<eos> He will still kill you, I think.<eos> But this is what love does, right?<eos> - It kills us.

Yes, you do. You always... I do not hate The Beatles.<eos> Okay, and that's a comparison that you always make. Well, I... 'Cause it's obvious.<eos> Apple.<eos> Really? Apple? Right, listen.<eos> If we come up with something better, we'll change it.<eos> Let's just go with it and see if it sticks.<eos> It will display up to 192 memory locations on the monitor simultaneously.<eos> Allow me to explain because it's quite fascinating, actually.<eos> The logic board is rather complex, especially compared to some of the other boards here, including of course, the Altair.<eos> And as you can see... it's much smaller, and cheaper to manufacture and build... which, by using dynamic RAM, I was able...

And it's my job to make sure that we point the ship in the right direction.<eos> So why don't you let me do my job?<eos> All right, let's put this to a vote.<eos> Those in favor?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Ed?<eos> Mike?<eos> Sorry, Gil.<eos> Nothing personal.<eos> When you grow up, you tend to get told the world is the way that it is, your life is just to live your life inside the world and try not to bash into the walls too much.
Lello!<eos> Aren't you stopping tonight?<eos> Mom!<eos> When I see you I blush!<eos> Andrea...<eos> - You're crazy.<eos> - No, mom, I'm not crazy!<eos> I've got problems.<eos> "As the light flashed, love sat down in the corner.<eos> Shy and distracted as it was.
Congratulations on your win.<eos> We're done.<eos> Hey, wait, I know you...<eos> Blue eyes!<eos> You were at the execution.<eos> You're just like me, you're from the future!<eos> So what exactly are we dealing with here?<eos> 2,000 pounds of classified gel concentrate, military grade.<eos> We will write history together, brother.<eos> The battle isn't over, it's hardly begun.
Because of you?<eos> And how's that?<eos> I could've had you arrested, I didn't.<eos> I covered for you and here you are.<eos> Rich, alive and free.<eos> Are you blackmailing me?<eos> Well I have to say...<eos> This only makes you more attractive.<eos> The game is changing, Kellogg.<eos> The future might be in play, you want history to turn out like it should, so do I.
- Deniability and such.<eos> - But I insist.<eos> You wanted this Mr. Martin, there are no half measures.<eos> You are either all in or you have no use to us or the movement.<eos> You're right.<eos> Great job!<eos> Putting the blame on a scumbag like Wolford raises it to a whole new level.<eos> Well, two for one in my books.<eos> We will be counting on your support, Mr. Mayor.<eos> You will have it.
Show them to me.<eos> What about the rest of his head?<eos> Coyotes will get that.<eos> Long as there's no teeth.<eos> They're not gonna let this end.<eos> Not now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I'm switching you to buckshot.<eos> Yeah. Doesn't have the stopping power of a 12-gauge, but you seem comfortable with it.<eos> It shoots slugs too, but you wouldn't hit anything.
Honestly, I couldn't get to you any other way.<eos> Regardless, I'm very grateful.<eos> I am nothing if not world-class at showing my gratitude so we have checked you in to one of our company's executive luxury penthouse suites and your account has been credited with the amount of money that you lost.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just do me a favor and don't try to win your tuition online again, okay?<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> How do you think I know?<eos> Studying my player history, ran it through your algorithm, saw that I was playing way above my mean.
- Okay.<eos> Do you want to try?<eos> - Come on!<eos> No.<eos> I have never played electric guitar.<eos> You've got to start sometime.<eos> Kenneth can show you good chords.<eos> We'll teach you how told hold it.<eos> It's not dangerous.<eos> It won't bite.
She looks like the other girls.<eos> Yes, she fits the profile.<eos> Could Elise still be alive?<eos> We simply have no way of knowing.<eos> - How's the cat?<eos> - What?<eos> How's your cat?<eos> Elise was supposed to feed it.<eos> Was the cat weird when you came home?<eos> It must've been hungry.

You already asked me to do a study on him,<eos> Jack.<eos> I said no.<eos> And anything scholarly on Will Graham would have to be published posthumously.<eos> So, you've never been alone with him because you have a professional curiosity.<eos> Normally I wouldn't even broach this, but what do you think one of Will's strongest drives is?<eos> Fear.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Will Graham deals with huge amounts of fear.<eos> It comes with his imagination.

I can't really say when they started.<eos> Um... I just slowly became aware that I might not be dreaming.<eos> It's encephalitis.<eos> - That's your pre-diagnosis?<eos> - Yes. Based on...?<eos> I could smell it.<eos> So your sense of smell has gone from calling out a nurse's perfume to diagnosing autoimmune disease.<eos> He started sleepwalking and I noticed a very specific scent.<eos> And what exactly does encephalitis smell like?<eos> It has heat.
In a coconut-coriander- chili sauce.<eos> It feels like a last supper.<eos> You're not the only psychiatrist accused by a patient of making them kill.<eos> Poke around a psychopath's mind, bound to get poked back.<eos> What would you do in my position?<eos> Deny everything.<eos> I thought psychic driving would have been more effective in breaking down his personality. Psychic driving fails because its methods are too obvious.<eos> You were trying too hard, Frederick.<eos> If force is used, the subject will only surrender temporarily.<eos> Once a patient is exposed to the method of manipulation, it becomes much less effective.
I'll take care of them until then.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have to do some tests.<eos> They'll be the standard psychopathology tests.<eos> I suppose you're gonna ask me to draw a clock while you're at it.<eos> Did Hannibal ask you to draw a clock?<eos> Said it was an exercise... to ground me in the present moment.<eos> A handle to help me hold on to reality.<eos> Was the clock normal?<eos> Would I be here if it wasn't?
Whatever you're feeling now, that won't last.<eos> Things change.<eos> Things are changing for me, too.<eos> I've been doing some accounting of what's important in my life and what isn't.<eos> You are important, Abigail.<eos> Just because you killed my dad doesn't mean you get to be him.<eos> Abigail, you've been through a traumatic event, and no one more traumatized than you, Abigail, but we went through it together.<eos> What you write, you write about all of us.<eos> I don't need your permission.<eos> And you don't need our approval, but I hope it would mean something.
If you go to Jack, then you murder Abigail's future.<eos> Do I need to call my lawyer, Will?<eos> We can tell no one.<eos> What we are doing here is the right thing.<eos> In time, this will be the only story any of us cares to tell.<eos> I feel terrible, Ms Lounds.<eos> It never entered my head you might be a vegetarian.<eos> A lapse on my behalf.<eos> Research always delivers benefits.<eos> If it contradicts a good story, hell, publish it anyway.
Hit him.<eos> Come on, darling.<eos> Do you remember the story I used to tell you of the Emperor Moth?<eos> Just a little thing.<eos> A naturalist once came upon the cocoon of this rare creature, just as it was struggling to emerge in its new form.<eos> He watched as it writhed and labored terribly to shed its shell.<eos> And then the neck of the cocoon split.<eos> It seemed to gain no progress.<eos> Unable to witness such a thing of beauty suffer so... the man produced a blade and cut it free.<eos> He cradled the new moth, waiting for it to spread its fine wings.
Really, thanks.<eos> Richard, I'd like nothing better than to hand over my practice.<eos> At the rate you're going, you'll work until you're 80!<eos> And with no teeth.<eos> Picture it.<eos> So, Sarah, tell me about your organization.<eos> The idea is to work with former doctors with fragile populations,<eos> to take over for social services.<eos> So it's more preventive than curative, but it's a somewhat different approach.<eos> Please, eat or it'll...
It is. It is a haven, I know.<eos> I swear an oath, Mr. Franks, may God strike me not necessarily dead, but seriously injured if I fail.<eos> No, no, I really am serious.<eos> Very well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, you're early.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Have you seen Delsanto's work?<eos> Yeah, I looked her up, too.<eos> It's incredible.
Why the hell doesn't she just stay at home and paint?<eos> You think that cane is from a football injury?<eos> She has rheumatoid arthritis.<eos> You know, there was a time when my Edie couldn't even brush her teeth.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good poem, Jack.<eos> So you saw it?<eos> Yes, honors art class made copies, and I saw one.<eos> I'm eager for the magazine to come out.<eos> But it's not coming out for weeks, and I've got my review coming up, so you'll tell them?
Yeah, the fuck you did.<eos> Well, tell me more about what you see.<eos> It's things that... that aren't right.<eos> What kind of things?<eos> The baby in the blood pouch.<eos> The river glowing red.<eos> A dog hatching out of a big black egg.<eos> A demon with a crown of light.<eos> A needle the size of a sword.<eos> This needle, was it... some kind of drug?
It would really make my day if you would just try it right now while the lemon cream is still hot and tangy enough to really do its job.<eos> Come on. I dropped a bomb on the stove. Need to know if it's worth the money.<eos> Of course it was the idiot's money but...<eos> It's delicious.<eos> Really?<eos> You really think so?<eos> I really...<eos> I'm so happy we're neighbors, you have no idea.<eos> Let me know how the cream works.<eos> Don't let it sit too long 'cause it will lose all of its flavor.
I try to make women feel young and powerful.<eos> We don't often feel that way.<eos> For someone who writes about sex, I'm surprised you don't eat meat.<eos> Really?<eos> Half of India is vegetarian, and they don't have a problem reproducing.<eos> But do they enjoy the sex?<eos> Fred loved meat.<eos> More than he loved me apparently.<eos> It's like this lamb was born in this sauce.<eos> Just try it.
The relationship between... between the two women and you would be the same as the relation between Moses and Elijah and Jesus.<eos> And that's where it becomes blasphemous.<eos> I see.<eos> You don't even... you don't even know who these women were, do you?<eos> No, but one of them did look like the Virgin Mary, now that you mention it.<eos> Well, it wasn't the Virgin Mary, I can tell you that.<eos> From your description, it must've been Valeria Messalina, the wife of Emperor Claudius, the most notorious nymphomaniac in history.<eos> I thought she looked like your icon.<eos> We have that image from a statue in the Louvre.<eos> It's made like a Hodegetria, but it's not a religious person, far from it.
The book burners have nothing on modern society.<eos> I think society would claim that politically correctness is a very precise expression of democratic concern for minorities.<eos> And I say that society is as cowardly as the people in it who, in my opinion, are also too stupid for democracy.<eos> I understand your point, but I totally disagree.<eos> I have no doubt in the human qualities.<eos> The human qualities can be expressed in one word:<eos> hypocrisy.<eos> We elevate those who say right but mean wrong, and mock those who say wrong but mean right.<eos> Society is based on hate.<eos> It should be based on forgiveness.
For what?<eos> - For my horse.<eos> Yes, I understand that part. What kind of horse?<eos> Well, it's not very big.<eos> No, I just meant is the whip for dressage or for jumping? Um...<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is a dressage whip.<eos> Well, it's probably for jumping, then.<eos> Okay. Like this?<eos> Is it used?
Yes, because he was constantly checking my cunt juice.<eos> The way old ladies check their potted plant to see if they need watering.<eos> It is an interesting point that you actually lubricated in expectation for a pain that you hadn't experienced.<eos> Your body prepared itself for an intercourse that you knew wouldn't happen.<eos> I can only describe the mood as sexual.<eos> Despite K's immature appearance, his methods were surprisingly refined.<eos> As I twisted and turned while he was whipping me, I could feel how clever his knots were.<eos> If I fought them, they would get tighter, and as I relaxed, it seemed they did, too.<eos> Like a cat playing with a mouse.<eos> Fooling it to believe it has a chance of escape and then attacking it again.
Four.<eos> Five.<eos> Six.<eos> I'd seen through K's knot technique, so I was able to loosen my position a bit to move my pelvis and thereby stimulate my clitoris against the cover of the book.<eos> Forty.<eos> And when you came home, Jerome and the child were gone?<eos> I haven't seen Marcel since.<eos> This sentimentality...<eos> Why?<eos> - Because it's a lie.
And all I can hear is the cat flap, swinging back and forth.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I didn't know you had a cat flap.<eos> I used to have a cat, so I have a cat flap in the door to the stairwell.<eos> But how did it get outside?<eos> I never thought of that.<eos> I suppose through the basement.<eos> The thing is... Every time someone opens the door to the street, the cat flap squeaks.<eos> There's a lot of drafts in the house.<eos> It hasn't squeaked yet.
After all this sadness, may I ask what happened to the silent duck?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> The silent duck.<eos> I'd forgotten all about it.<eos> One night K had been in what was for him an unusually good mood.<eos> I don't know what caused it, but he didn't hit hard, and he joked that he would introduce me to the concept of the silent duck.<eos> One hardly dare imagine the quacking duck.<eos> Well, deep down, little K seems to have been a jolly man with versatile talents.<eos> But he got that bit about Roman punishment and the 40 lashes wrong.<eos> Because it's true that the highest punishment was 40 lashes, but it had to be delivered in series of three.
I don't have anything to say to a psychologist.<eos> I'm not suggesting therapy. I'm demanding it.<eos> Even if you leave us, it'll be the same at your next job and the one after that.<eos> Why didn't you want to speak with a psychologist?<eos> It's an old story.<eos> I just don't like them.<eos> Well, if you insist that I try to understand, then you have to tell me that story as well.<eos> The old story.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's not that old after all.
But in relation to...<eos> to your addiction, do you feel relieved like you thought you would?<eos> No.<eos> What should I do?<eos> I'm ready to do what's necessary.<eos> Sex addiction is very different from, say, abuse of drugs or alcohol because you don't actually need either of those things.<eos> These addictions can be completely removed by removing the drug or the alcohol, not that that's easy.<eos> But the difference with sex addiction is that everyone has a sexuality that's an integral part of their personality.<eos> If one could imagine exterminating sexuality, then you'd be left with a severely reduced person because... because sexuality also includes tenderness, contact, solidarity with others, which would be hard to imagine anyone living without on some level.<eos> What you're saying is that no one can remove their sexuality, even though it's destroying everything for them.
Joe.<eos> Why did you start coming to my basketball matches?<eos> It wasn't a coincidence, was it?<eos> No, it wasn't a coincidence.<eos> I didn't tell you because I...<eos> I thought you'd be upset... and that you'd get angry at me.<eos> I won't get angry-<eos> What I do...<eos> My job isn't a normal job.<eos> It's not legal.
I would've said that it's more difficult not to when, as a dictator or as me, you've nothing to lose.<eos> For a human being, killing is the most natural thing in the world.<eos> We're created for it.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> No, get off!<eos> Fireman's grip.<eos> Fill all my holes, please.<eos> I still don't know why the gun didn't work.<eos> I did check to make sure that there were bullets in the magazine.<eos> It simply malfunctioned.
I don't know about Bond, but I assume it has to be apparent from his books and his films that you have to rack an automatic pistol.<eos> Of course, you're right.<eos> I've seen it in films a thousand times.<eos> It's morning.<eos> The snow is gone.<eos> - So the sun must be up?<eos> Yes, there is sun.<eos> How can you see it?<eos> This alley's located so that you never get direct sunlight here, but I can see a small reflection on the building on the other side.<eos> I've never managed to figure out where it comes from.
It's not much, but it's the sun you get here at my place.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> In the beginning, you said that your only sin was that you asked more of the sunset.<eos> Meaning, I suppose, that you wanted more from life than was good for you.<eos> You were a human being demanding your right, and more than that, you were a woman demanding her right.<eos> Does that pardon everything?<eos> Do you think if two men were to walk down a train looking for women, do you think anybody would have raised an eyebrow, or if a man had led the life you had?<eos> And the story about Mrs. H. would've been extremely banal if you'd been a man. And your conquest would have been a woman.<eos> When a man leaves his children because of desire, we accept it with a shrug, but you as a woman, you had to take on a guilt, a burden of guilt that could never be alleviated.<eos> Your abortion was legal, but more than anything else, it was a punishment you inflicted upon yourself.
Take this hand right here, pretend it's going over a wave like you're out there in the ocean.<eos> You floating.<eos> Come on, son.<eos> You floating out there in the ocean.<eos> Tidal wave coming across the bottom to the other side.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're waving now.<eos> Bring it back up. Here comes the big one!<eos> Yeah! There it is.
You won't win either, but I was at least attempting to represent...<eos> Well I don't know!<eos> Not just "bollocks to everything".<eos> If you were preaching revolution, well that'd be something, but you're not because that would require courage and a mindset.<eos> And what have you got?<eos> Who are you?<eos> What are you for?<eos> Morning.<eos> So, final push.<eos> You remind everyone that's got the app that if they recommend it to a friend it unlocks a little fez for Waldo.
Tell me more.<eos> Poe often wrote of revenge.<eos> I want my chapter to be about revenge.<eos> I want to target the people who hurt you professionally.<eos> I've done my research.<eos> I know who they are.<eos> I'm not above revenge, Agent.<eos> I think I've proved that.<eos> Revenge is primal.<eos> It's a universal theme, and every good story needs one.
Do you have problems with it?<eos> You go ahead eight hours memorizing what you see.<eos> Come back, give us the information and we place bets.<eos> It will provide power to your little journey.<eos> Power cells are homemade.<eos> Produced headquarters.<eos> Keeping them away from prying eyes.<eos> -I Would not do that, buddy.<eos> You said that the machine had a lock.<eos> -So It can not go backwards.
He's my son! He's my son!<eos> I'm ashamed of my own blindness.<eos> Man's true destiny is freedom.<eos> The wish to be free is like a natural impulse.<eos> It's an impulse that comes from the gut.<eos> It's like... lt tastes good.<eos> It's like laughing like breathing.<eos> Who can stop the rain?<eos> Who can stop the wind?<eos> Who can stop the earth when it trembles?
Everybody knows that...<eos> It's not that kind of cab, guys.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Is my penis, really, really that small?<eos> Honestly?<eos> I love it.<eos> And what about my cavern?<eos> It's like a little child's.
Yes, Gio last week we were erst<eos> Maybe a boat to Formentera?<eos> With DJ on board, loose feet in the sand ...<eos> Beach is what wannabes.<eos> So I do not know Kevvie can not organize someone your age that?<eos> Sorry, aber...<eos> Ah, her friend would really great find, if they should do this for your friend.<eos> N i ch t?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it is a really gigantic fan
Hey.<eos> I guess this will be a pretty awesome show, with you as support.<eos> Here?<eos> Tonight.<eos> I do not believe it.<eos> - Real madness.<eos> All ... doors open.<eos> I always thought it was totally great on this island.<eos> So you still mix with?<eos> You know, this island is, it is chilling rough.
Kind of terrible in bed and just very clumsy.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Just a sec.<eos> Here.<eos> It's my last copy, but I really want you to have it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'm a little intimidated.<eos> I'm not really good with poetry.<eos> Just let it wash over you.
He thinks he should take Tess to school, not me.<eos> Tess wants it to be me, because she told me.<eos> But, I mean...<eos> Thank you. Can't you both just take her?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> He's such a wreck about her going away.<eos> She doesn't need that kind of energy right now.<eos> And he just focuses so much onto her.<eos> She can feel it.
- A teacher?<eos> Yes, really.<eos> Is that a fucking monkey I see before me?<eos> Do you know what my problem has been?<eos> I am one of those unfortunate people who is congenitally faithful to his wife.<eos> Unlike the rest of the population, I don't want to go to bed with strangers.<eos> I only like her.<eos> For me, there's never been sex without an attempt at love.<eos> Love is the only interesting thing.<eos> It's far, far more difficult to do than sex.
You miss that train next time and I won't be waiting.<eos> - Yeah you will, you want me too much.<eos> - Ha! Don't you count on it! I might have a better offer.<eos> Bollocks! You'll never find anyone who loves you as much as I do. Yeah?<eos> And how much do you love me then?<eos> Well, I love you more than you love me, that's for sure.<eos> - A black tea please.<eos> - You should try the hot chocolate.<eos> Just got this new machine.<eos> It's gorgeous.
I'll sweep and scrub the floors, change the girls' linen, cook for them, do whatever you ask of me.<eos> You, a char?<eos> You would make step-sisters of my girls and I would have mutiny in a week.<eos> Now, tell me. Where have you been these last years?<eos> Did one of our gentlemen make you his own?<eos> Lucy? Please, Miss Susan.<eos> Will you not let me work?<eos> Then I know not what will become of me.<eos> Lucy, look at you.<eos> The truth of this world is that men have designed it for their own purpose and pleasure.
You have a gift for saving lives, for redeeming them. It is so pure!<eos> But what about you?<eos> BASILEUS:<eos> Silent and ferocious - as a tiger! - (WHOOSHES)<eos> No orders today. A pact, perhaps.<eos> Strong and upright as an elephant.<eos> Your love is here, isn't he?<eos> He came here to save you, didn't he?<eos> As perceptive as a falcon, his senses are more acute than any other living creature.<eos> True love is a rare and precious thing, especially when it survives among such walls as these. No.
Under Cossinius and Furius, of course.<eos> An offer better received from the men themselves.<eos> They've withdrawn to a villa on the outskirts of Nuceria, within short ride of what remains of their legion to the north.<eos> Spartacus continues to gather force in the valley of Campania<eos> You know I would not have come if situation did not demand of it.<eos> No.<eos> You would not.<eos> Their terms are agreeable.<eos> I will dispatch message to them immediately.<eos> Best I send my own men, to ensure it arrives at intended destination.
That would place us between Crassus advancing from the north and Cossinius and Furius in the south.<eos> We do not have the men to face armies on both fronts.<eos> We must strike Cossinius and Furius before odds tip to imbalance.<eos> We have inflicted nagging wound.<eos> Yet for months we have failed to shatter resolve of their men.<eos> Perhaps the heads of their commanders carried before us would so sway them.<eos> Trophies proven difficult to win.<eos> On the field of battle, yes.<eos> By what is written here, message was not directed to where their troops lie.<eos> It speaks of hope that word finds them safe within the villa.
You creative.<eos> I give you that, high-tits.<eos> Now get the fuck out the way.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, there's an entire pig in there?<eos> Yes.<eos> For four of us?<eos> It's a small pig.<eos> I really wanted to use the box.<eos> It was my birthday present.
So, that's it. I could feel it coming.<eos> Claire, he went to the Élysée with a gun.<eos> So? He walked through the gardens too.<eos> You know he visited at night, they don't do the same checks.<eos> And he was Rohmerieu's friend.<eos> But you still think they killed him!<eos> I know you don't work for a real newspaper now...<eos> Let me stop you right there.<eos> I work for a real newspaper.<eos> Just because it's online...
Week after week, the Buyende camp more closely resembles a town...<eos> They arrive in hundreds each day, sometimes in thousands, like yesterday.<eos> Tomorrow, the UN General Assembly must adopt a second aid plan for the Niyamalinga refugees.<eos> Many here truly hope they will rise to the occasion.<eos> You're from there?<eos> How did you get here?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Do you realise what you're asking of me?<eos> Do you realise what will happen when that text gets out?<eos> It will get out, you're right.
Item?<eos> We will leave tomorrow.<eos> The I have never agreed.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I want the musical ruler Europe be, "you said<eos> London is the new capital of the world<eos> We must conquer Here you lie at your feet<eos> But that lasts not forever<eos> The fall of a new attraction<eos> So riding on the wave of success, as long as it carries us
No, I would like to stay.<eos> Why?<eos> - The maid.<eos> What is your name?<eos> Charlotte.<eos> - Charlotte as Carlotta?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Please call me Niccolo.<eos> Do you want to show me the city?<eos> It is so strange and big.
It would be unwise arrive there with her.<eos> I let the young lady align where to find us.<eos> You were incredible.<eos> - So what I've never heard of.<eos> Urbani.<eos> I can not bear all the people.<eos> Send them away.<eos> - As you wish, Maestro.<eos> Where is Charlotte?<eos> I have sent for her It is determined on the go.
Why do you think I'm wearing this black glove all the time?<eos> I thought it was a fashion statement or something.<eos> Fashion statement?<eos> I've been in fucking prison 12 years.<eos> I missed a few things.<eos> I thought it was the latest fashion.<eos> I don't know!<eos> You always were a bit of a clothes fag.<eos> You lost your fucking hand?<eos> It was shot off three years ago during a job.
Come on, love.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, love.<eos> Come on, my love!<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, live!<eos> I found it, Dom.<eos> I found my hand.<eos> It was hiding underneath one of the cars.
So, Peter, tell us, is there a special someone in your life?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, there is someone.<eos> Aww. Aww.<eos> Ohh. Well, do tell.<eos> The person's actually here tonight, a person who is... also in the Games.<eos> In the Games with you?<eos> Aww. Aww.<eos> Well, go on.<eos> Well... it's a person I've been wanting to get closer to for a long time.
- Where are my children?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You don't? Where are they?<eos> - I don't know anything, I swear.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Goldstein.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Ferruti is going crazy.<eos> - No, I... - The hearing!<eos> about to start. If you're not there, it'll be postponed and we can't...
Okay.<eos> I believe there a cremated human remains in it.<eos> Yep.<eos> Those are cremated human remains, all right.<eos> So what are we supposed to do?<eos> Did you contact the previous tenants?<eos> They were university students.<eos> They ran out on me two months' rent. I didn't wanna toss it in case the person mattered to someone.<eos> Someone was nice enough to cremate the body and, uh, pick out a lovely urn.<eos> It's very lovely.
Papa.<eos> This man's ambition includes you.<eos> You will endure shame and risk your position for a man without name who will sully yours and drag your reputation into the gutter.<eos> I take great offense at your summation of my character without even knowing me.<eos> Where is your right?<eos> I have every right.<eos> Not until you cease from judging the entire world as those above and those below and begin to see people as people.<eos> Human beings who think and feel no more or less than you do.<eos> I know there is a lady in Belsize who is waiting to be your wife.<eos> No, I have an ambitious aunt in Belsize who, like you, assumes that wealth and reputation are all that life depends on and despises love as though it were the devil's own creation!
- Private lessons?<eos> - Math lessons, Mom.<eos> Fine.<eos> You have condoms, at least?<eos> - Mom!<eos> - What?<eos> We do the lessons at school, in study hall.<eos> So?<eos> You know, desire sneaks up on you, honey.<eos> It never waits for the right time or place.
We'll have Larkin by tonight.<eos> Two against two.<eos> I like those odds.<eos> I'll call for backup.<eos> It's already here.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> I was looking for you.<eos> Um, I forgot to get your number.<eos> Cool.<eos> It's, uh, 1-800-GiveMeYourFuckingGuns.
Straight arrow, take the gun from her!<eos> Now you want me to save your scrotum?<eos> When is the shipment coming in?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All right!<eos> There's a shipment on Wednesday!<eos> Where?<eos> I don't know!<eos> I swear to God, I don't know! Tell her!<eos> Just tell her where it is!
He pours her coffee...<eos> I hope I don't disturb you, trodding in my heels up there<eos> Not at all<eos> Trod in your heels to your heart's content<eos> So you're a poet, Herr Kushemski<eos> Just an amateur<eos> And a trained lover of fur<eos> The love of fur is...<eos> I'll skip that line<eos> No, read it!
Of course I'm right<eos> But, hey, you're an artist<eos> She loves that about you, loves your sensitivity<eos> Maybe you're the first really sensitive guy she ever met<eos> She loves books, opera, ballet, that shit<eos> At night, a foreign movie, you discuss novels before a nice quiet copulation<eos> Nothing like some quiet copulation to help you relax<eos> But a voice rumbles in the back of your mind<eos> Calling for something else<eos> I don't know what but it rumbles
Why would he give you back all of those memories, but not give you the plan?<eos> Peter, before I met him,<eos> I didn't think it was possible to love you more, but now, knowing what we've been through, and everything we've had...<eos> I do.<eos> You never liked public displays of affection.<eos> Or going number two in a public restroom.<eos> I remember that too.<eos> The Commander awaits.<eos> Anomaly XB-6783746 has been found.<eos> It is being hidden in 2036.
I do.<eos> You never liked public displays of affection.<eos> Or going number two in a public restroom.<eos> I remember that too.<eos> The Commander awaits.<eos> Anomaly XB-6783746 has been found.<eos> It is being hidden in 2036.<eos> For what purpose?<eos> That is not yet clear, but whoever hid this anomaly did so for a reason.<eos> It should not exist, but someone wanted it to exist.
We have the rocks from the mine in Pennsylvania, the magnet, the Observer beacons, and some scrolls of physics that none of us can decipher.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I can help you with that.<eos> These things we've collected, how they can possibly be used to travel through time?<eos> They are part of a device that we must build.<eos> I have the hologram blueprints.<eos> It also requires technology that hasn't been invented, from my time.<eos> How do we get it?<eos> I took them from the future long ago, the tech is hidden.<eos> It's not far from here.
You would not have it any other way.<eos> Do you remember getting a white tulip?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It was a sign from God.<eos> The tulip was important.<eos> I took it from the other timeline, and kept it.<eos> When we devised the plan to stop the invasion, you didn't think we could succeed. You doubted yourself.<eos> I knew the tulip would give you strength, as it had before.<eos> It was your symbol of hope and absolution.<eos> It gave you the courage... to push on.

Well, I've stopped.<eos> This analyzes your precise frequency.<eos> I developed a way to directly read the waveform-- much more efficient than the old school test.<eos> - You have the patent for that?<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's now cross-referencing men and women with compatible resonance.<eos> Only a small sample--<eos> Just the teachers that would let me take their reading this morning.<eos> That's how you define true love?<eos> That's how nature defines it.
I'm pretending... waiting for it to become real.<eos> And it never will.<eos> It's the side effect.<eos> The side effect.<eos> Of course.<eos> Look at that. One minute.<eos> Looks like I'm leaving right on time.<eos> The two of us are just not destined to be together.<eos> Irony--<eos> The indirect presentation of a contradiction... between an action or expression and the context in which it occurs.
Why was it a secret?<eos> It wasn't.<eos> It just fell out of history by mutual consent.<eos> There were rulers who still harbored thoughts of using the book again, and the masses didn't take too kindly to being reminded they are just mechanisms--<eos> Complex, certainly, but mechanisms with buttons to push, nonetheless.<eos> Music-- it's the reset button.<eos> Where is that, precisely?<eos> The soul.<eos> And what happens when the music stops?<eos> Oh, it can never stop.
Where is that, precisely?<eos> The soul.<eos> And what happens when the music stops?<eos> Oh, it can never stop.<eos> Why do you not talk to her?<eos> I... can't.<eos> You can.<eos> (Knowledge determines destiny)<eos> It is a bit of a surprise.<eos> We expected his frequency to be above average, but it is exactly average, to 10 decimal places.
Yes.<eos> And here's your credit card.<eos> Sorry, but what's this for?<eos> You need me to tell you that?<eos> Rock concerts, shoes, candy, lip gloss... the things a girl your age needs.<eos> And there is no limit.<eos> So I can buy anything at all?<eos> You're the Ruby, you can have anything you want.<eos> And if... I donated a ton of money to my friend Leslie's mother's cat rescue?<eos> I'd ask you to bring me a receipt for the donation. Here, just sign it.
Make it fast.<eos> Right away.<eos> Here's the canvas mock-up.<eos> I am totally sorry.<eos> I tripped.<eos> Here's a mock-up.<eos> I tightened the ballooning waist.<eos> For the stitching, I thought... a coral topstitch.<eos> Coral?<eos> I know it's an unusual color, but... it works well with this season's prints.
They looked exactly like this.<eos> May I see it?<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Yes, he would send the sandal to the Forensic Department.<eos> There could be traces of it.<eos> But on the other hand, he said, it was a fairly common model. Pax.<eos> - Who sent it?<eos> - Yes, it's strange.<eos> I can not handle this.<eos> If it had been in the water - Then it would not look like as it does.
No idea, but, Pete, he has no problem using this artifact to kill.<eos> Rick got the money, and... He was gonna kill Barton.<eos> Said he didn't need him anymore.<eos> There was a fight.<eos> Barton got the bottle, and...<eos> Oh, he buried him in lava.<eos> The bottle?<eos> What bottle?<eos> This old copper jug.<eos> It belonged to my nana Paccia.
That's all right.<eos> I'm just glad you managed to track me down.<eos> I hope you don't mind coming here. It's Mum's favourite.<eos> No, no, it's... it's very nice.<eos> Um, just...<eos> So, Philomena, how are you?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I had a hip replacement last year, Martin.<eos> Right.<eos> It's much better than the bone one I had before.

I remember that day so clearly.<eos> We all knew what it meant when a big car arrived.<eos> Kathleen was inconsolable.<eos> She knew this time they'd come for Mary.<eos> Come away from there!<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> I had a stomach ache, Sister Hildegarde.<eos> It's my time of the month.<eos> You're not unique in that regard.<eos> Put your mind to your work and it will pass.
Oh, dear.<eos> And what did he die of?<eos> I don't know. I didn't find out.<eos> - I'm at the airport.<eos> - You're at the airport?<eos> Well, she just wants to get back, be with her daughter.<eos> - What about the story?<eos> - Well, he's dead.<eos> Dead or alive, happy or sad. They're both good.<eos> Spin it. Find a story.
Warms the heart.<eos> Catholics and Anglicans taking tea together, pretending to be all chummy.<eos> Pretending?<eos> Oh, come on, Father.<eos> Underneath it all you think the other side's going to hell.<eos> And besides, all the pomp and bluster of Catholicism, it's all a bit silly, isn't it?<eos> Norman!<eos> Forgive my brother.<eos> - He's entitled to his opinion.<eos> - As odious as it is.
If you ever need to talk, I won't try and convert you.<eos> What are you doing up here? I came to reset the clock.<eos> Strange you didn't do it.<eos> You're normally so fastidious.<eos> In case you haven't noticed, I've had a lot on my mind.<eos> I did notice.<eos> Where did you get that? The hammer? I borrowed it from the forge.<eos> The gloves, you left up here the other day.<eos> Explains why there weren't any fingerprints on the hammer. - I think there's something dangerous about being on high places, even to pray, don't you?<eos> Looking down on the world and all the people in it.
Look...<eos> If you haven't got plans, I just got offwork, and...<eos> - Can I buy you a drink?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> - But good luck.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Get lost!<eos> Mom, hand me the water, please.<eos> I can't reach it, Mom.<eos> Give it to me!
It'll just be...<eos> It'll just be our little secret.<eos> Your voice sounds weird, like it did on the radio.<eos> You heard that?<eos> I have a computer.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sometimes your dad makes mistakes.<eos> I better go.<eos> No.<eos> I don't like to hear your voice when it's like this.
we will never speak of it.<eos> Sir...<eos> I heard from Linda about a half an hour ago.<eos> The President wants to meet with you.<eos> 8230.<eos> About what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Frank.<eos> You know, when you brought up this idea, I wasn't sold.<eos> It struck me as both desperate and careless.
- I just had to undress, you know?<eos> - I don't.<eos> Those freshman punks stole my clothes.<eos> Max, you've got to...<eos> - I have to finish talking to Herb first.<eos> - Hurry up! Max!<eos> Herb, I don't care about coffins.<eos> Who cares if they're oak or ash?<eos> You're not going to die.<eos> And we're not playing at your funeral, as it's canceled.
Yes, there is Hakan.<eos> Wait, I'll just go out.<eos> I have to go back to Stockholm.<eos> Can you drive us to Sturup?<eos> - You can tell us what happened?<eos> - Do not ask me about my job.<eos> Just drive.<eos> - Hello. Can I have a bite to eat?<eos> - The kitchen is closed.<eos> - It closes the eleven o'clock.
You a real woman, Chapman.<eos> A real grown woman.<eos> And not like all these other girls around here.<eos> I can't waste my time with these silly bitches.<eos> I need a real woman.<eos> I'm sure that you'll find one.<eos> -I wrote a poem, you wanna hear?<eos> -You know, that's fine...<eos> "Before I met you the sun was like a yellow grape<eos> "But now, it look like fire in the sky
It is your first time, and it's likely for your stabs to be... tentative, all right?<eos> I think it's better for you to do with something thin and sharp like this.<eos> It has more impact.<eos> All right?<eos> You can do this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> What's your problem?<eos> I'm not gay, all right?<eos> Last night was great.<eos> No, it wasn't.
I'm not gay, all right?<eos> Last night was great.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> You could have fooled me.<eos> Look.<eos> I can't be what you want me to be, Paul.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's just not who I am.<eos> Why do you always have to label everything?<eos> Last night was exactly what it was supposed to be.
- It was crackling with revolution.<eos> The Poplar Docks are on strike.<eos> Did our friends give us what we asked for?<eos> - How much?<eos> -200 pounds.<eos> - Who did you meet?<eos> - An attache from the Russian Embassy.<eos> In a Chinese restaurant.<eos> Our revolution is international.<eos> It grows by the day.
But I haven't seen you in, like, six months.<eos> Except for when I drunkenly stalked you at your...<eos> Right.<eos> That was kind of adorable.<eos> It was either psychotic or sad.<eos> Not adorable.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> Can you hand me that pillow?<eos> So, why do you need to get out of your apartment?<eos> It just felt small.
I think there are some carriages over there that are going to be empty but...<eos> Jesus.<eos> Freddie?<eos> You came back?<eos> I got a tip-off.<eos> Freddie, Tommy will kill you.<eos> It was Tommy who tipped me off.<eos> Maybe he's got half a heart after all.<eos> Tommy got a message to me.<eos> It said "Get out of town and take her with you."
Well, I'll say you find a woman and you fall in love<eos> And you ask her and she says yes<eos> You ask her and she says yes<eos> Let's get married<eos> I love you And I wanna stay with you<eos> Let's get married<eos> Have kids Grow old and grey with you<eos> Let's get married<eos> Hold hands When we walk in the park<eos> - Let's get married - All right, you can have a cat Just as long as it barks
Roderick?<eos> I'm sure it's an alias.<eos> Roderick Usher-- it's from Poe's<eos> "Fall Of The House Of Usher."<eos> When we were at the farmhouse, Emma got a call from this Roderick.<eos> Cult leaders often have a second in command, someone to oversee, manages the cult.<eos> Do you even know how many people are involved in this?<eos> I mean, are we talking fans or prison groupies or people with serious mental disorders?<eos> And do we know how many of them have killed?<eos> Truth is, we don't know, but it's a lot bigger than we thought, more pervasive.
- For what?<eos> - Piney bastards keep robbing my garage.<eos> We don't handle auto theft.<eos> I got 1,000 gallons of whiskey in there.<eos> What would you want us to do?<eos> Don't you catch bootleggers? Not for other bootleggers.<eos> Well, I got a surprise for the next fox in the henhouse, tell you that much.<eos> What surprise?<eos> Back door, pulley, shotgun.<eos> - I didn't say it.
So, Rachel, it turns out you're not the mild-mannered housewife I thought you were.<eos> We've been through a lot, Aaron.<eos> Not now, all right?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just that you're alive, which is, you know, newsworthy.<eos> And you knew about the necklaces and the blackout.<eos> - Aaron...<eos> - Rachel.<eos> Ben gave me that necklace.<eos> It drove me nuts.
Fish and Wildlife.<eos> Had a bug up her ass with the Rumancek kid.<eos> Tom, whatever she told you--<eos> - She as much as accused him of being a werewolf.<eos> Me being a civilized man, I laughed it off.<eos> As you should since it's bloody ridiculous.<eos> She called me about a hair sample, male.<eos> What the hell was I supposed to do with that?<eos> Listen.<eos> There is an explanation for this and it's not the supernatural.
What if I was in the hospital?<eos> What if I needed you?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Are you in a hospital?<eos> I need some money.<eos> Hello?<eos> Norma?<eos> Hello?<eos> So I want you to just think about poetry tonight.<eos> I mean, what does it mean?
What if I needed you?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Are you in a hospital?<eos> I need some money.<eos> Hello?<eos> Norma?<eos> Hello?<eos> So I want you to just think about poetry tonight.<eos> I mean, what does it mean?<eos> Why is it timeless?
I am not making this up.<eos> I believe you.<eos> Could you tell what the voices were saying?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Except for one, which I heard clearly which was,<eos> "I just want you to know the truth."<eos> - Whose voice was it?<eos> - I don't know..<eos> Just like what I saw here, which was this figure kind of hunched over.<eos> What was it doing?
Talk to me!<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Were you here the whole time?<eos> Well, I'm worried.<eos> Thank you,<eos> This clock is broken.<eos> Yes, it's broken.
I...<eos> I...<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Were you here the whole time?<eos> Well, I'm worried.<eos> Thank you,<eos> This clock is broken.<eos> Yes, it's broken.<eos> It had stopped.
I must become something else.<eos> Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> You told me to stay away from your family and I did.<eos> But your family isn't staying away from me.<eos> Which means something must be done about it.<eos> Where can I find the man in this picture?<eos> Do you not think it convenient you captured me so easily?<eos> Run!<eos> Do you even know what this island really is?<eos> It's a prison.
- Look, we believe that sensitive information came into Markussen's hands and he was trying to extort money for its return.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> Can't find out about pack four.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> I don't have time for your espionage stories, and I don't have time to be hauled in here at your every whim.<eos> If you'd like to talk to me again, please contact my attorneys.<eos> She's lying.<eos> She's being blackmailed.<eos> Which could mean that she had a motive to kill Nick. Yeah.<eos> So, Browning lied about her knowledge of the SD card and whatever information it contained.
- Have Metro pick up London.<eos> - I'm way ahead of you.<eos> They're already walking him to interrogation as we speak.<eos> Where's my lawyer?<eos> - Look familiar?<eos> - Never seen it before.<eos> Possession of stolen property.<eos> We can start there.<eos> I found the watch.<eos> I had no idea it was stolen.
No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I've never even thought about having a kid in this job,<eos> - with the hours and then the risk.<eos> - Is it that, or is it Adam?<eos> No, everything is fine with Adam.<eos> Adam is great. I trust Adam.<eos> I just, I just don't know if I'm ready.<eos> I can't stop thinking about this SD card.<eos> Why did it disappear when Markussen died?
I don't know.<eos> I mean, I've never even thought about having a kid in this job,<eos> - with the hours and then the risk.<eos> - Is it that, or is it Adam?<eos> No, everything is fine with Adam.<eos> Adam is great. I trust Adam.<eos> I just, I just don't know if I'm ready.<eos> I can't stop thinking about this SD card.<eos> Why did it disappear when Markussen died?<eos> And more importantly, where is it now?
Watch yourself, boy.<eos> Where's Margie?<eos> I thought she was with you.<eos> Oh, my God! No!<eos> Go back to the house.<eos> Go!<eos> Move!<eos> What was that thing?<eos> It was a Hellhound.<eos> See, when you sell your soul to a demon, they're the ones that come and rip it out of you.
It's about money, a lot of money.<eos> It means you'll have to train twice a day, at the very least.<eos> Majid, I'm glad you're here.<eos> We were talking about you and Sergio, and this situation.<eos> Sergio's uncle is a good friend of mine.<eos> I think we should talk this over.<eos> It seems one is owed money by a friend of the other.<eos> And one threatened the other with a gun.<eos> Those are sensitive issues that have led to some tension.<eos> As far as that gun is concerned, I'm already happy it didn't get used.
A game?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What kind of game?<eos> Not the fun kind.<eos> Yeah, well, how was I...<eos> I mean, why... why am I...<eos> No one knows why they're chosen.<eos> One day the box just shows up and it starts.<eos> After that, there's no getting out.<eos> Where does it come from, the box? I...
While the disease remains undetected, patients will die. Patients do die sometimes, Dr Turner. I would say that was an occupational hazard.<eos> Sir, I have just diagnosed a heavily pregnant patient with advanced TB. She has five children. She might well die, because I didn't know she was ill.<eos> You know that TB need no longer be a death sentence.<eos> We can treat it. But we have to get in early so people have the chance to recover.<eos> We don't seem to be making much ground here, do we?<eos> We are stating, plainly, that this is a highly complex, logistical programme.<eos> The vans ARE coming to London. Where to?<eos> In Poplar, we might have up to a dozen people living in one small house or tenement flat.<eos> When conditions are over-crowded and unventilated, infection spreads with ease.<eos> Meanwhile, someone who is infected unwittingly takes the disease to an over-crowded production line and transmits it to his colleagues.
It says here the thing for scourge of the bladder is marshmallow.<eos> They've got them down the pick'n'mix in Woollies.<eos> I don't mean the sweets, I mean the herb!<eos> We'll have to get down Hackney Marshes, it grows there.<eos> They might have pills for it, at that clinic. The maternity clinic?<eos> It'd all be free. This book tells us all we need to know.<eos> Can't we just ask to go and see that nurse? The little one. Nursey No Brains?<eos> Ahh, oh, might I venture to hope that you are in fact a cook?<eos> We are abandoned by the esteemed Mrs B every Tuesday, and must make shift for ourselves.<eos> The stench of last week's spam is still clinging to my three-ply. That's very clever. Is it Pinky, or is it Perky?
THEY LAUGH<eos> The whites of a lion's eyes are no laughing matter, I can assure you.<eos> Nor is the advancing derriere of an elephant in reverse.<eos> A pair of my spectacles is testament to that.<eos> LAUGHTER<eos> Won't you miss your wonderful adventures?<eos> I think we have more than we could have dreamt of just around the corner.<eos> 'Home is not simply a mark 'upon a map any more than a river's just water.<eos> 'It is the place at the centre of the compass 'from which every arrow radiates and where the heart is fixed.<eos> 'It is a force that forever draws us back or lures us on.'
It's all right, love, I won't bite.<eos> OK, now...<eos> Sue, Steve, come round here, and I'll show you how to administer the medicine.<eos> Now, let's have a look.<eos> Right, see that hole there?<eos> Yeah. OK.<eos> Right in the middle between the first and second vertebrae?<eos> That's where the syringe goes.<eos> Oh, no - like that, that way.<eos> OK, so just pop it in the hole, like that.
Oh, well... you know when the Government passed that law banning people drinking alcohol on public transport?<eos> But, you still get lots of folks on the bus drinking cans of lager, don't yer?<eos> So, if I do go outside...?<eos> Oh, there might be a spot of bother.<eos> Mum, could I have a quick word in private?<eos> OK, just in here.<eos> Right.<eos> By law, I have to give you this. Well, if you notice Kieren acting strangely at all, it might be a sign that he's...<eos> Well, there's this illegal drug going around, PDS kids are calling it "Blue Oblivion".<eos> And it's very dangerous.
Come on.<eos> Well, I...<eos> Come on!<eos> We can't give up.<eos> We have to find out who he's seeing.<eos> Last thing Daddy needs is some trashy strumpet using his fragile heart as a way to his money.<eos> Now, what makes you think that this person is trashy?<eos> Well, this cheap hooker bra she left at my house for starters.<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I bet whoever it is has taste, and wants it back 'cause it's so expensive.
Wait, Tansy...<eos> Tansy, wait. Tansy...<eos> Well, hey, don't take the canoe! GEORGE:<eos> You can go ahead and stop all that smiling, Mom, 'cause you're not gonna like the way this ends.<eos> And you know what, Mom, seriously-- get another hobby.<eos> I'm not planning on going back to New York anytime soon.<eos> Did I ask?<eos> (crickets chirping) AnnaBeth.<eos> Hi. Now, I just gave Oliver an injection of Sumatriptan for his migraines.<eos> Now, it goes to work in a couple of minutes, but he's lying down for now.
- Listen, Larry, don't tell her.<eos> - Why?<eos> Prison is a fishbowl, son.<eos> The last thing she needs is an enemy to obsess over, do something stupid out of anger.<eos> She should serve her time and leave without any trouble.<eos> - I'm not gonna lie to my fiancée.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because our relationship doesn't work that way.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> It's based on trust and honesty.
Oh, god. George?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You were just tellin' me that I'm sexy and beautiful.<eos> I-I was and I will, just...<eos> Oh, god, this isn't about you, I swear.<eos> It's all the intestines in my... intestines.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you sure it's not me?<eos> Love, thankfully, is resilient.<eos> It can continue to thrive in the most unlikely circumstances.
What exactly do you find dubious about that, Father?<eos> I was hoping for a little ecumenical goodwill.<eos> I'm truly sorry about your family.<eos> But understand, I am merely looking after the interests of my flock.<eos> And I'm the Big Bad Wolf?<eos> Precisely.<eos> Nobody's being preyed upon.<eos> Then might I ask, how much does it cost to join your order?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Everything the religion needs, it gets from me.
Awful kindly of him.<eos> Saved my life.<eos> Gave me more time with my girls.<eos> Gave you more time with your brother.<eos> Can't put a price on that.<eos> Can't put a price on anything anymore.<eos> I found this in one of the cells.<eos> Lost more than the Good Book there for a while.<eos> Lost my way.<eos> "And if your right hand offends you, cut it off, cast it from you.
Before and after.<eos> Anyway, hope we can get past it.<eos> Let bygones be bygones.<eos> It's a diversionary tactic.<eos> It keeps the walkers away.<eos> Didn't work so well with those two.<eos> You got a camp?<eos> It's just us.<eos> We have a town.<eos> It's walled.
Shit.<eos> It's jammed!<eos> - They're not helping anyway.<eos> We did it?<eos> We did it.<eos> Come on down.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't shoot.<eos> Drop the weapon, son.<eos> Sure.<eos> Here, take it.
I got it right here.<eos> They could have killed him, they didn't.<eos> They want something.<eos> Confirmed identities of who were dealing with.<eos> Charles Mead, the man who abducted Claire Matthews, is one.<eos> The other is Louise Sinclair out of New Orleans, former Blackwater operative.<eos> Another overachiever.<eos> Find out if she ran the plates yet.<eos> We put out an APB in a 300-mile radius of Richmond.<eos> If it's out there, we'll find it.
In fact...<eos> I was hoping to present this with a cupcake or something.<eos> Happy graduation.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> It's human bone.<eos> Oh.<eos> Legend says it was worn by the 2,000-year-old witch Qetsiyah, who drew on it...<eos> For strength.<eos> Bonnie, you have come so far so fast.<eos> If you trust my opinion, your magic is exactly where it needs to be.
Stefan, wait.<eos> Turns out I miscalculated. Kol's gonna be a problem.<eos> I almost killed someone, and that's what you miscalculated?<eos> April could've died today. That's only because you didn't know the extent of your abilities.<eos> My father just became mayor.<eos> I can't be out doing black magic.<eos> That's not what expression is.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> It's a way of doing magic that isn't monitored by nature or the spirits. It isn't good nor bad.<eos> But it also has no limits, so how you use it is up to you.
Otto.<eos> Why is Wendy listed on there as a guardian?<eos> Just getting things in order.<eos> Do you want to earn your way back in?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means you do everything I tell you to do.<eos> You know what happens to whoever kills me? I'm counting on it.<eos> That's Clay's gun.<eos> This weapon is registered in your name.<eos> It was just used in the murder of Damon Pope.
I' ve done this experiment for many years, and I 've never had a single mushroom .<eos> I have a very healthy pussy flora.<eos> Hygiene is a lowercase word to me.<eos> One shouldn' t wash one' s pussy too much.<eos> My goal is that it can be smelt easily and seductively right through the pants .<eos> Men will then percieve this, unconsciously, because we are all animals so, who want to mate .<eos> Preferably with people who smell of pussy.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> The consistency of the pussy-mucus plays a major role.<eos> It is always different.
Come on.<eos> You know, I could use a place to stay while I'm getting my sea legs back under me, George.<eos> And you got a nice place here.<eos> What do you say?<eos> George? George?<eos> I hope George has been food shopping.<eos> I'm famished.<eos> So this book contains a list of the names of the guys you've been hunting.<eos> And this book, your mother's, has the same list of names.<eos> It's identical.
Have Ray meet me downstairs.<eos> And where should I say you're going?<eos> Brooklyn.<eos> I did not expect the great Harvey Specter to come all the way to Brooklyn just to deliver a contract.<eos> That's good, 'cause I came for the hot dogs.<eos> I told you, that was our final offer.<eos> You did, but the third quarter's about to end, and if you want Deron Williams playing for you in the fourth, this is his number.<eos> Even if you had another offer, which you don't, he can't leave in the middle of a game.<eos> I was talking about the fourth quarter of game seven, when you're looking to lock up a championship, because the question isn't "do you want Deron or not?"<eos> It's "do you want a ring or not?"
I'm charging you because you're the one I caught.<eos> Ava, can you give us a minute?<eos> Okay, she's gonna write you a check.<eos> Let's talk about how much.<eos> I'm sorry, Harvey.<eos> Not this time.<eos> Is that what I said to you on Hazelton? That was a long time ago.<eos> We're not at the D.A.'s office anymore.<eos> I didn't realize our bond had an expiration date.<eos> It doesn't, but... you want to deal on this, I need jail time.
I am not a complete stranger to romance if that's what you're implying.<eos> Maybe I am now, but I wasn't always.<eos> I thought these were all bills.<eos> Daisy!<eos> This one's for you.<eos> Daisy? Who's that from?<eos> Don't tease her, Mr Barrow.<eos> Who sent you a card?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's not signed.
After all he suffered in the war, he's killed in a stupid car crash!<eos> Matthew is dead, 50 years before his time!<eos> Isn't that enough for me to deal with?<eos> Just leave me alone!<eos> Exactly what I was afraid of.<eos> She is living a nightmare.<eos> We must all step back and allow her to come through it in her own time.<eos> Aren't I right, Mama?<eos> We can't discuss it now.<eos> This mousse is delicious, Carson, is it the work of Mrs Patmore?
Most household appliances use between 300 and 900 watts.<eos> So that's what I'd provide.<eos> That's all I'd provide.<eos> I wouldn't go to the trouble of creating a system that gives, say, 25,000 watts, which would be enough to run an electric furnace, because that would be...<eos> overkill.<eos> So, what about this device is overkill?<eos> This thing right here is connected, like some kind of massive accumulator. It's, uh...<eos> like an energy-storage device.<eos> And if this weapon uses plasma armature... and I think it does, then...<eos> It would never need that much power, not even by a long shot.
- Oh, hey, Tom.<eos> Yeah, I seem to have misplaced my keys, you know?<eos> Hi.<eos> You forgot your keys.<eos> See you in class, Professor.<eos> That happened.<eos> Tom.<eos> A little bird told me that you are the top candidate to fill my position when my term is up.<eos> Now all you have to do is not mess it up.<eos> Thank you, Dean. Yeah, maybe the Philosophy department will finally get that funding it so desperately needs.
Um, yeah, of course I do.<eos> It's just, I'm, um, I'm running late.<eos> So how about tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How about a movie night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You read my mind.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Unfortunately there was a surgical complication with the donor liver, and it is no longer viable.
Okay, facial function.<eos> Still twitching.<eos> Syringe.<eos> I was worried I missed the whole thing.<eos> Where are we at?<eos> Where we're at is, I'm trying to focus.<eos> I mean, how long has the patient been open?<eos> Counting the minutes I'm wasting answering your questions?<eos> I'd have fewer questions, but your intern told me that the surgery had been moved to 3:00.<eos> Clearly, it wasn't.
Oh, boy.<eos> "Oh, boy," what?<eos> It says we need the instrument of original infection.<eos> Okay, the instrument of original infection would've been the cat's claws.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - Well, let's get the cat.<eos> What happened to it?<eos> - And?<eos> - Well...<eos> And it's out on the street now?
They launched their own internalized interrogation program without the knowledge of the conventional US military forces or even the Central Intelligence Agency.<eos> Because of the extreme secrecy surrounding the program, there was a variety of abuses.<eos> Torture?<eos> I would say that, yes.<eos> The President has made a political and military calculation to let the Joint Special Operations Command run wild.<eos> So you're saying JSOC is able to hit harder under President Obama than they were under President Bush?<eos> Harder, faster, quicker with the full support of the the White House.<eos> On my last day in Sana'a, a file had been left for me at my hotel...<eos> A leaked investigation into the strike of Al-Majalah.<eos> It included a list of the dead.
He said in a small note that he's going to look for his father.<eos> He left from the kitchen window, and he took a bus to the governorate of Shabwah.<eos> Then when his father was killed, his grandmother told him,<eos> "There is no use for you to stay anymore." And he said, "Yes, I will come back in two days."<eos> On the morning of October 15th, we got a telephone call, and they told us he was blown up to pieces by the drone.<eos> And they saw only the back of his hair.<eos> You know, his relative, his cousin, he knew his hair from the back, and he recognize it, and he knew that Abdulrahman really was dead.<eos> But they could not recognize his face or anything else.<eos> I always teased with him about his, you know, big- his hair, you know, that he should cut it, because I thought that he should do that.<eos> The drone had not just killed the boy, it vanished him.
Even better.<eos> Kiera will probably appreciate the privacy.<eos> Look, this has nothing to do with her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Understood.<eos> Look, I've seen what you can do alone so I really don't think we'll have much of a problem.<eos> Please... can I offer you a coffee, tea, soda, beer?<eos> Soda please.<eos> You seem pretty sure this is a sound investment.<eos> Yeah, an investment when you know the payoff is not a risk, it's a sure thing.
Yeah.<eos> Carlos radioed in, they were ambushed.<eos> One dead guard, they're driving blind on country roads, waiting for backup.<eos> Okay, well let's get them some.<eos> Redirect the decoy convoy to their last known position and send in air support to cover the area.<eos> How the hell did Liber8 get wind of this?<eos> You think we have someone inside feeding intel to Liber8?<eos> Well, I wouldn't rule it out.<eos> Where's that backup?<eos> It should be here any minute now.
You wanna tell me what happened before you go in?<eos> It's just a sprain...<eos> That's not what I'm talking about.<eos> You and Ricky are lucky to be alive.<eos> Look, I didn't take anything, okay?<eos> But Ricky did.<eos> You have no idea what you're dealing with, Alec.<eos> This isn't some everyday joy ride.<eos> I said I didn't take anything, jeez, just back off.<eos> This drug, Flash, it shouldn't be around for decades.

One extremely illegal hack in T-minus now.<eos> This explains so much.<eos> If this is the only outside contact Carson had prior to being sequestered, it has to be how they sent the threat.<eos> What's that right there?<eos> Not much for subtlety.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Can you trace the source of the email?<eos> - Alec?<eos> - On it.<eos> It came from a public hotspot in New West, I can't track any further than that.
Seriously?<eos> He's using the government to intimidate us now?<eos> That is pretty desperate.<eos> You can tell him we're not backing down.<eos> We're not here about the birds.<eos> - Owls.<eos> - Owls are birds.<eos> It's not just about the owls.<eos> It's about greed.<eos> "We do not ride the railroad, it rides upon us."
So Bentley was in the woods yesterday because he was scouting locations for cell towers.<eos> Well, that makes sense, but she doesn't.<eos> I mean, first thing, he's the devil.<eos> Next thing you know, she's crying over his death.<eos> I don't know if that's suspicious or just another facet of women I'll never understand.<eos> Is there anything about women you understand? Booby region.<eos> Oh.<eos> Bingo.<eos> I cloned his SIM card.<eos> It was damaged, but I managed to get a few numbers. - Anything good?
Do you know what will happen then?<eos> Maybe your brother will die. If he's not already dead.<eos> Shut up!<eos> You should have minded your own damn business.<eos> If you hadn't interfered, then it might have succeeded.<eos> Was I not enough?<eos> Why him?<eos> You were just for fun. I did this for Stijn.<eos> Without the Iris software that implant won't work. Don't look so surprised.<eos> It collects data, it makes connections... it analyzes logarithms... it calculates choices and it reduces the risks.
Then get me my money back.<eos> I want the motel and the house on the market as of today, and I want an open house on Sunday. Can you do that? All right.<eos> Okay, yes.<eos> I'll relist it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, and no sign out in the front.<eos> I still need to earn a living until it gets sold.<eos> Of course.<eos> Norman, that short story you turned in, it's incredible.<eos> - It is?

I'm sorry, Norman, about the moving.<eos> It's all right, mother.<eos> I'm sorry I said you were crazy.<eos> You're not crazy.<eos> Let's go to sleep.<eos> Norman.<eos> Are we finishing your story after school?<eos> I don't think we should send it in.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't think my mom would-- would like it, you know, being published.
You should have chosen the dark side, Master Jedi.<eos> [gasping] Your emotions betray you.<eos> Your fear, and yes, your anger.<eos> Let your anger deepen your hatred.<eos> Don't listen to him, Obi--<eos> - Quiet.<eos> You can kill me, but you will never destroy me.<eos> It takes strength to resist the dark side.<eos> Only the weak embrace it.<eos> It is more powerful than you know.
Or, should I say, was your fiance.<eos> In case you haven't guessed, the pair of you aren't very popular.<eos> But I'll tell you what you are though.<eos> You're famous.<eos> 'The trial of Victoria Skillane finally concluded today, 'the verdict, guilty.<eos> 'Together with her fiance lain Rannoch, whose death in custody 'had delayed the trial, Skillane abducted six-year-old 'Jemima Sykes just miles from her home, 'prompting a nationwide search 'amidst emotional pleas from her parents.<eos> 'For months, the youngster's disappearance had been a mystery, 'the sole clue being her distinctive white teddy bear, 'discovered in a lay-by two miles from the family home.<eos> 'The white bear became an enduring symbol in the hunt for Jemima, 'a hunt that ended in a local forest.<eos> 'Jemima's body was found here.<eos> It had been wrapped in a sleeping bag and burnt.
I'm calling Emily for bail money.<eos> I don't want her involved in this. Fine.<eos> Nolan, then.<eos> You're not spending another night here.<eos> I don't want to drag any of our friends into this mess, okay?<eos> Jack, this is no time to be stubborn.<eos> Whoever gets us the bail money will get it back.<eos> No prosecutor's gonna believe for one second those drugs belong to you.<eos> If they trace the registration to the gun, they're gonna find out...<eos> That it was used to kill Kenny and Nate's father six years ago.

And death of Spartacus.<eos> Attius.<eos> I would have words, you fucking goat. Jupiter fuck me!<eos> Have you lost wit coming here, you mad shit?<eos> You are branded an enemy of Rome.<eos> I was told you hold no love for the Republic.<eos> Tell me you have not brought the Bringer of Fucking Piss and Shit to my very door? Your legend precedes you.<eos> I bring but opportunity.<eos> One that you may profit greatly from, if you are of a mind.<eos> It would have to be very considerable, to outweigh risk of association dragging me to depths.
Agron!<eos> Fall from sight.<eos> Revelry has struck sour note.<eos> I would not have senseless quarrel open gap between us.<eos> Then see it filled with coin at appointed hour.<eos> And we shall test sureness of our footing.<eos> Spartacus stands displeased with celebration's end.<eos> I was not the one who caused offense.<eos> The Cilician overstepped, yet your response was--<eos> Was as it fucking should be.
It is a dangerous thing to be removed from them.<eos> Since Tiberius is restored to imagined power.<eos> You rattle tongue against your master?<eos> I but whisper of common threat.<eos> And means of striking it from mutual concern.<eos> Gratitude for private audience.<eos> I would not have it known that we break words.<eos> They yet remain whole within fucking mouth.<eos> You have witnessed foul mood.<eos> Do not deepen it with mystery and obscured purpose.
And leave Caesar far removed from plots and schemes.<eos> If victory over Spartacus is shared with Tiberius, I fear their bond will be forged in permanence.<eos> Cut circle with straightest line, and give voice to what you would have of me.<eos> It lifts heart. To know you are yet among us.<eos> Fate owed to you.<eos> Crixus tells of how you carried me upon back.<eos> It is what any of us would do.<eos> For another warrior.<eos> She yet requires rest.<eos> She will have it, for a time.
You would be lost as well.<eos> Gannicus will not fall to wind and ice.<eos> Wine forever in his blood will keep him warm.<eos> I have never favored the cold.<eos> Share blanket, and see yourself warmed.<eos> I have no need for it.<eos> Your teeth threaten to shake from head.<eos> As do mine.<eos> Your wound gives pain?<eos> It reminds that I yet live.
Grip sword.<eos> And have it so.<eos> They have taken all from me.<eos> You will yet serve purpose in coming battle.<eos> By seeing those who cannot fight to the mountains.<eos> Return to task with Nasir, and prepare for journey.<eos> The man is more dead than living.<eos> And yet eager to give life to your cause.<eos> My cause?<eos> It does yet not stand your own?
Well, Shelby, I believe it's customary to knock before you walk into a room.<eos> Well, you want me to go back out and come back in again?<eos> No, I want you to go back out and then go back out.<eos> We're in the middle of something here.<eos> Well, it's gonna have to wait, 'cause I need you to come with me.<eos> Did you not hear what I just said?<eos> I ain't asking, Boyd.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Don't worry about that gun.<eos> It ain't loaded.
I understand why Kembleford and other places' have set up committees like this.<eos> These are terrifying times.<eos> Fear of a Soviet atomic attack seems unavoidable.<eos> Paranoia about radiation is not.<eos> As I hope I've just demonstrated, radiation is essentially the act of giving off energy.<eos> It is an entirely natural process.<eos> This instrument will tell us the level of background radiation in this room.<eos> Oh, it seems we have a radioactive source amongst us.<eos> There's no need to...<eos> Please, it's very weak.
Hello.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Fine, thank you, Father.<eos> I just don't like big crowds.<eos> I never realised you were so talented.<eos> Most people just think they're weird.<eos> Weird... ..and wonderful.<eos> You like jazz?<eos> I'm learning to.<eos> I like all music... ..except when it's being murdered on the church organ.
I agree, it's the fundraising that counts.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I probably won't even enter.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Give someone else a chance.<eos> It's the Christian thing to do.<eos> Well... ..anyway.<eos> What?<eos> I can't see in this thing.<eos> Put it back on, we'll be starting shortly.
It's a leaving present.<eos> She handed in her notice last week.<eos> You never said.<eos> Why would I?<eos> It's got nothing to do with you.<eos> She's been working for you for six years.<eos> And hands in her notice right after taking a fortnight's holiday.<eos> What was it doing under our bed?<eos> Must have fallen out of my pocket.<eos> Why isn't it in a box?
I thought if his corruption was exposed then we would have an excuse to leave with our heads held high. Why?<eos> Do you think it was him?<eos> Just before he died, the mayor said he had a secret.<eos> Do you know what he was talking about?<eos> No. Do you know where I might find Bloom now?<eos> We arranged to meet at three o'clock this afternoon.<eos> Where?<eos> He was going to introduce me to a journalist.<eos> He wrote the address down on a card.<eos> It's in my bag.
Aren't you here to do just that?<eos> Speak on his behalf?<eos> If I were to speculate, I think the President would...<eos> Speculation is a poor form of investment, and an equally poor form of politics.<eos> Tell me what you know.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Well, what do you think I should do?<eos> You personally, Frank Underwood?<eos> My opinion isn't what matters here.<eos> It does to me.
Yes, it's possible.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?<eos> Well, that's hardly my problem.<eos> No, you get on it.<eos> It's...<eos> I have to call you back.<eos> What is it?<eos> SanCorp's stock.<eos> It's up 35% in the last four hours.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system...<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
The age you've chosen to end your life too.<eos> 17-6-21.<eos> So, you see...<eos> Maybe you and I are connected.<eos> Two reckless people.<eos> Then what's the use?<eos> We're just gonna keep breaking things...<eos> Over and over.<eos> Why not save everyone the grief?<eos> The thing about the world is that it doesn't have any extra pieces.

Time code shows a 5 minute 20 second interval.<eos> The blood and fibers on her boots confirming that she entered Harris Ryland's residence.<eos> Yes. Carrying a concealed weapon that ballistics later confirmed as her own weapon...<eos> A Smith Wesson 5906 9mm, which she fired at her ex-husband.<eos> That's correct.<eos> So then, Detective Danko, what, in your experience, does the crime-scene evidence and this short timeframe suggest to you?<eos> That the shooting was deliberate, premeditated.<eos> Dr. Lefont, as the trauma surgeon operating on our victim, Harris Ryland, can you describe for us the injuries he sustained as a result of the shooting?<eos> Mr. Ryland was struck by a single gunshot to the chest, the bullet striking the fourth rib, which deflected it downward, severing the intercostal artery.<eos> If the bullet had entered one centimeter higher, it would have fractured the rib and punctured the heart, killing him.
I'm Will Gardner.<eos> Morgan Croft.<eos> Sorry to lose Elsbeth as an opponent.<eos> She was very entertaining.<eos> Can you beat them?<eos> Yes.<eos> The Erobos team shot that commercial last December.<eos> - Is that correct, Anna?<eos> - Yes. - Were you ever paid for it?<eos> - No. It was also never shown.
- Yes. - And you are familiar with the booster scandal, docteur?<eos> Yes, I'm the one who discovered it.<eos> - And the new compound, dexitetrasolone.<eos> - Uh-huh. And after you discovered it, did you test this... substance?<eos> No.<eos> We're still waiting on subpoenas of private labs<eos> - in China who manufacture it.<eos> - I see, so... you have never seen this mysterious substance.<eos> You have never held it, never tested it.<eos> So how can you be positive it even exists?

Rule 44G, subpart M of the AADL code states,<eos> "All samples shall be shipped "via approved courier on the same day that they are collected."<eos> I am aware of the code.<eos> "Any unexplained delay in shipping "will constitute a break "in the chain of custody, and the test must be discarded."<eos> Occasionally, a technician is unable to mail the sample on the same day, usually because the courier is closed.<eos> There's no violation as long as the sample remains in our facility.<eos> That is why we, um...<eos> Merci, mademoiselle.<eos> That is why we checked the log at your testing facility.<eos> It was closed.

How can I help you?<eos> I understand you're leaving town tomorrow and putting Dana Scott in your stead.<eos> Yes, I have some business to attend to on the coast.<eos> Yes, your business with Bayne-Powlen in Los Angeles and Tillson-Tuttle in San Francisco.<eos> Do you really think you could take meetings with other firms and I wouldn't know?<eos> - Why would I not?<eos> - Because we have a deal. That deal presupposed that you could control your man.<eos> I can control him.<eos> Then why the hell did you allow our wager?<eos> For the same damn reason you made it.
They don't want to have any dissent.<eos> Don, you're a writer.<eos> You know this is censorship.<eos> I am a writer and I'm against the war, but when you buy a commercial, you're hoping that the consumer is in a good mood when they hear your message.<eos> So if you agree on a wholesome variety show and all of a sudden it's filled with satire-- the most threatening humor there is-- you're worried about people hating what you're selling.<eos> Megan, let's talk about you and how you found this man.<eos> I could cast you, you know that.<eos> Yes, I'm sure he is a man who plays many roles.<eos> Luckily you don't have to worry about censorship with the show because it's so tame.<eos> Of course it's for daytime entertainment.

Well, that dumb kid that I trained, he would never have made it.<eos> You?<eos> You might just have a chance.<eos> Yep, it's Fyers.<eos> Satellites showed multiple heat blooms on the island.<eos> What the hell is happening there?<eos> There was a complication.<eos> Slade Wilson?<eos> I'm handling it.<eos> Well, handle it better.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
Who the hell are you?<eos> Blanket immunity.<eos> You tell me what I want to know, and it's yours.<eos> This guy, right here.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> Someone got to you, didn't they?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Brian Kelly, he just hung himself in his cell.<eos> Between that, this glitch in the fire alarm, and the fact that MacAvoy's hands are sweating now when they were bone dry 20 minutes ago, and I don't trust anyone anymore.<eos> Someone has been tampering with this investigation since it started, and if he's saying it's Holt... then I think it's Warren.

Could you tell me why Logan Pierce can't even look the man he's suing in the eye?<eos> 'Cause he's asleep.<eos> You didn't violate our patents, we screwed up.<eos> We'll help you raise the venture capital funds you lost.<eos> Uh, thank you.<eos> Who's next?<eos> Emily Morton's lawyers are here. Mm, great.<eos> According to Detective Carter,<eos> Ms. Morton sold Friendczar her matchmaking site,<eos> They promised her they'd launch her site worldwide, and instead, they made sure it never saw the light of day.
You don't get to share that with me.<eos> Now you say you've changed, so I'm gonna trust you.<eos> But if those mistakes you made come back to haunt you, you will not expect me to cover for you.<eos> Now we may be partners, and we might even be friends, but, um, I'm still a cop.<eos> Understood?<eos> Yeah, I hear you.<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> I'll be home in 12 hours to help with the next number.<eos> I'm afraid that'll be too late.<eos> The next number's already come up, only it's not new.
- How's the cell saver coming?<eos> - Almost ready.<eos> - Do we have surgical glue?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Avitene?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay, I want two bovies set up.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> - Joy, get my headlamp ready.<eos> Here it is.
Yeah, I guess.<eos> I should... look, I gotta...<eos> I gotta get out of here.<eos> Will you... will you call me when he's out?<eos> Sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> With which we ourselves are being comforted by now.<eos> Blessed be the god and father of our lord Jesus Christ.<eos> We can't repair the carotid under tension.<eos> It'll pull apart.
Taken out some pictures.<eos> Look what you've done, Phil!<eos> Mom!<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's finally sleeping.<eos> Hey, we should take a picture of all of us.<eos> Then once you get going, you know, you just can't stop.<eos> You're taking everything down with you.<eos> Oh!<eos> And then, to make it perfectly clear to your father what happened, I'll put the golf ball right here, because some people can't see the danger unless it's right under their nose.
And... untrue.<eos> The damp towels and the presence of your toiletries in the guest bathroom-- they suggest that your wife has banished you completely from the master bedroom.<eos> No.<eos> Stress in the marriage is to be expected, given your current unemployment.<eos> Wait, I'm sorry.<eos> H-How did you...<eos> Movie ticket.<eos> It's, uh... Yesterday.<eos> Monday.<eos> It's for a matinee.
Uh, I'm not sure what you're asking.<eos> Intercourse.<eos> Were you and Teri having it?<eos> I assume you're referring to the conversational variety.<eos> No, I meant fornication.<eos> The insertion of part A into part...<eos> Mr. Silver, we are not here to judge you.<eos> No, we're just... simply inquiring if your time with Mrs. Purcell involved coitus.<eos> No.<eos> It did not.
Uh... no.<eos> So, tell me how you did it.<eos> I was in the study dusting, and I just took it.<eos> You unplugged it?<eos> I unplugged it, a-and I put it in my purse.<eos> You took your purse into the study?<eos> Nobody found that odd?<eos> Well, people don't look at me that way.<eos> I can do what I want.<eos> Give it to me.

In any event, a noble lady stands only on rare occasions.<eos> Then how do I move to pick something up?<eos> In that case thus!<eos> One proceeds on one's knees, and always gracefully.<eos> Be graceful at all times...<eos> Your Highness!<eos> Beautiful, is it not?<eos> Unroll it like this, and the story flows out in the pictures.<eos> Yeah!<eos> It really flows!
Okay, well, we're off to swim class.<eos> - Say good-bye to daddy.<eos> - Bye, daddy.<eos> See you after work, Harrison.<eos> Okay.<eos> A bench.<eos> Why a bench?<eos> She deserves more than a place where people park their butts.<eos> It's a nice bench.<eos> It's concrete, very sturdy.
A lot of thought went into it.<eos> I'm thinking we're looking for someone at least in their 30s.<eos> Intelligent, organized.<eos> Takes great pride in his work.<eos> I think he'd enjoy the fact that we're talking about him right now.<eos> You think there will be more?<eos> I'd be surprised if there are not.<eos> Any suspects?<eos> Uh, no prints on the gun.<eos> It sat in the rain all night.
That's not super-comforting, got to say.<eos> So as far as I can tell, these experiments -- the Thule were murdering Jews, gypsies -- just about anybody and everybody -- then trying to magically reanimate them.<eos> They were trying to figure out a way to bring their own dead back to life...<eos> Which I'm guessing they figured out because -- this.<eos> This last page... is a roster of every dead Thule member who was reanimated.<eos> This is why they killed my grandfather?<eos> Anything in there on how to kill it?<eos> Apparently, they experimented with that, too.<eos> Um -- headshot...<eos> But if you don't burn the body within 12 hours, it reanimates again.
She was a good fucking person.<eos> All right, well, note to self:<eos> Never talk about anyone Debra Morgan knows.<eos> Understood.<eos> Got it.<eos> Why don't you just be really grateful that I work for you?<eos> Because I'm about to make you a fuck-ton of money.<eos> It's an unopened bill from a storage facility.<eos> Why didn't FLPD find this?<eos> Because it just arrived today.
I was a little fucked up.<eos> Why didn't you call the police?<eos> I didn't know what I could tell them.<eos> You could have called me.<eos> You're the one that gets me into trouble, not out of it. Is that why you lied to me?<eos> All of a sudden we have a problem with lying?<eos> We found a gun in El Sapo's glove box. Is it yours?<eos> Shit, it might be, yeah.<eos> He took it off of me before he beat me up.<eos> It'll be traced to you.
You went to see Galuzzo?<eos> You could have exposed us both. It was worth the risk.<eos> He's definitely hiding something.<eos> So now what?<eos> I break into his house tomorrow, when he's at work, try to find hard evidence that he's our man.<eos> And in the meantime, what if he comes for me?<eos> Do you have any way to protect yourself?<eos> A gun.<eos> I haven't used it for years.<eos> Keep it loaded, and call me if you need me.
When a psychopath speaks about love, it doesn't really mean the same thing as for typical people.<eos> So what do you love about her?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> I love having steaks and beer with her, and until recently, the fact that she is always there for me, the way she looked up to me.<eos> But none of that is really about Debra.<eos> It's about what she does for you.<eos> So you're saying I'm selfish?<eos> I'm not criticizing.<eos> Selfless love is hard enough for typical people.<eos> And for psychopaths, it's impossible.
Dexter saw in the paper how this guy got off on a technicality--<eos> Dexter, you shouldn't be here.<eos> I was vetting Yates.<eos> - What did you do to him? - What are you going on about?<eos> He has a scar on his head exactly where your killer has been harvesting brain fragments.<eos> Is he another one of your little experiments?<eos> We can talk about this, but not here.<eos> Not with Debra in the other room.<eos> An X-ray revealed a lesion on Yates's brain.<eos> I suspected it was contributing to his violent behavior, so I... I suggested the new hospital remove it.
I just felt like I owed her one after we both bailed on your dinner the other night.<eos> Oh, my God, why won't you just admit that you like her and that I am an awesome matchmaker?<eos> I'll admit that you're an awesome nanny.<eos> You'll have to settle for that.<eos> We'll revisit this after the date.<eos> Oh, by the way, the TV remote has been missing since yesterday.<eos> I think somebody hid it, but I can't get anything out of him.<eos> Harrison, did you take the TV remote?<eos> No.<eos> - Do you know where it is?
You mind if I come along?<eos> You want to come along? Yeah, things are kind of slow here.<eos> I'm going a little stir crazy.<eos> Maybe you could use another set of eyes?<eos> Sure.<eos> I mean, you think Miller's clean?<eos> Come on.<eos> You dig deep enough on anyone in this department, and you know what you find?<eos> - What? - The shit.<eos> It's there.
So does that mean you care about me?<eos> Only to the extent that you sign my paycheck.<eos> Touche.<eos> Okay, what are we going to read tonight?<eos> Let me guess. "Wee Monkeys."<eos> "Wee Monkeys."<eos> Before I read to you, I gotta talk to you about the TV remote.<eos> You said you didn't take it, but Jamie found it under your bed.<eos> I didn't mean to break it.<eos> I was pretending it was a thunder blaster, and I dropped it in the kitchen.
Sorry about all that.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Have a good one.<eos> See you.<eos> - Hey! - Hey.<eos> You could've come inside.<eos> I just got your text. Oh, well, you know,<eos> I think I've seen enough of that place, you know. So...<eos> What brings you by?<eos> I wanted to let you know that a lab assistant position just opened up at Miami Metro, and it's yours if you want it.
But?<eos> But there's no life for me here in Florida.<eos> We both know it.<eos> I can have a life somewhere else far away from here... in Argentina.<eos> Maybe we all can.<eos> You and Harrison could meet me there.<eos> We can start over.<eos> It would be hard on Harrison to uproot his whole life.<eos> At first, it might be, but sometimes change is a good thing.<eos> - Sometimes it can--
- Because?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Uh, the swab thing in the interrogation room.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dex, come in.<eos> Hi, Dexter.<eos> He came in to clear his name on the Cassie case.<eos> I see.<eos> I had no idea I was a suspect.<eos> We got to your apartment, and it was totally cleaned out.
Please send help.<eos> I used to live my life at night.<eos> In the shadow of my dark passenger.<eos> I lived in shadows for so long, until the dark became my world.<eos> But over time, the people in my life flipped on a light.<eos> At first I was blinded, it was so bright.<eos> But over the years, my eyes adjusted, and I could see.<eos> And now what's in focus is my future.<eos> Bright.<eos> Brighter than it's ever been.
Last site someone visited on this computer was for an Aero Sudamerica.<eos> I'm gonna tail the Morgans, see if they'll lead me to her.<eos> Aah! What the fuck is going on here?<eos> Help me, please!<eos> Don't move.<eos> I used to live my life at night, in the shadow of my Dark Passenger.<eos> But, over the years, my eyes adjusted, and I could see.<eos> And now, what's in focus is my future.<eos> Bright.<eos> Brighter than it's ever been.
Dr. Kruper.<eos> Uh, Dexter. I'm Debra's brother.<eos> Ah, nice to meet you.<eos> Okay, just gonna check your stomach.<eos> So how are you feeling otherwise?<eos> I wanna go hiking.<eos> I wouldn't recommend that for at least a few hours.<eos> How is she?<eos> That bullet bounced around quite a bit.<eos> But it missed hitting anything important.
Ashley, could you please close the door?<eos> You don't always have to pay for dinner, you know.<eos> Well, chivalry isn't dead.<eos> It's just somewhere in my office.<eos> You said it's your platinum card?<eos> It's probably next to my computer somewhere.<eos> I forgot to warn you about that trick drawer.<eos> Don't worry. I'll clean it up.<eos> I still don't see your platinum card.<eos> It'll turn up.
So I'm standing here today asking of all you here what are you willing to do?<eos> Your dad would've been proud. Thanks, Mel.<eos> Heading back to the shop.<eos> Our airline doesn't run itself.<eos> I'll be there in a bit.<eos> Well, I think we're getting our message across, so...<eos> But the thing is, I spoke to some elders, and they're willing to pressure the chiefs.<eos> Then let them do the talking and just lie low for a while.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> We're not opposed to development, it just has to be sustainable, and it has to be safe for the environment, otherwise it's not worth the risk.
- Am I right?<eos> - We need jobs.<eos> You guys are brainwashed.<eos> We need to stop the mine.<eos> Go chain yourself to a moose.<eos> Piss off.<eos> You piss off.<eos> This won't help.<eos> New equipment just crossed the Deh Cho bridge.<eos> It will be here tonight and we will fly it to the mine first thing in the morning.
Mel.<eos> What the hell happened to you?<eos> Late night?<eos> Well, I just got a call from Twin Lakes Airline.<eos> And?<eos> You're not gonna believe this.<eos> Why are they still holding on to her?<eos> They are convinced that Deanna and Jonas were working together.<eos> Well, can't you get her out on bail or something?<eos> Jonas told the cops about another bomb, and it was wired to the ignition in Dearman's car.
Enough. Enough!<eos> You're done!<eos> The cops are on their way!<eos> There's another bomb, isn't there?<eos> Where?<eos> Please, Philip!<eos> It's Dearman's equipment.<eos> That's where the target is.<eos> You can't stop it.<eos> It was set to go off a few hours after the plane landed at the mine site.

I thought the basement looked cleaner.<eos> See?<eos> These are our bug-out bags.<eos> In here is everything we need to survive.<eos> Survive what?<eos> The looming kablooey.<eos> It's reassuring to see you're aware of the future, but this is all a little... creepy.<eos> Creepy?<eos> ! Marge, the apocalypse is coming.<eos> Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never, but it's coming.
I am.<eos> I know it's occurred to you that Karen took Anne to draw you out of Charleston.<eos> It's a trap.<eos> Tom, this is not smart.<eos> No, it's not smart, but like you said, Marina, the minute that we love, the world has something to use against us.<eos> I'm fighting for people I love with people I love.<eos> That should give me an edge.<eos> Project Orange.<eos> The complete file, not just the photographs.<eos> Everything you need to know about the Volm device, when it's gonna be deployed, and what we need to do to get it there.
He said he could see my cancer.<eos> In my eyes.<eos> And that I would be a part of helping people.<eos> He said it would all be clear once he got to the place where the air had yielded to stone.<eos> Before I could ask, he'd already gone to another room.<eos> Cryptic. (CHUCKLES)<eos> Great.<eos> We love cryptic.<eos> Can you describe the copper bowl?<eos> Only that light came out of it.
- Yes.<eos> - Mortality is awful.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I had to prove to Nick, to myself, that I deserved it.<eos> Sutton, listen to me, okay?<eos> You have to be careful,<eos> - you're not indestructible anymore.<eos> - Oh, it's not so bad...<eos> - Ow!<eos> My shoulder, it's not healing.
And what about funeral costs? Wait.<eos> What?<eos> He died?<eos> Which makes it felony hit-and-run.<eos> He was stable.<eos> His concussion led to a brain bleed.<eos> That man's death doesn't change the fact that it was an accident.<eos> Felony hit-and-run, under these circumstances, is 12 to 15 years.<eos> You wanted courtesy?<eos> Here it is.
I negotiated a settlement with the sister of the man who was killed in a car accident today.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No, no.<eos> It's not what you think. I, um,<eos> I gave this family dignity.<eos> And as hard as it was... It was the best day of work I've ever had.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Liam's plea deal came through.<eos> It's on its way to Gillian's.
God bless.<eos> What is this?<eos> Sarah?<eos> Sarah!<eos> Did she have any rings on her fingers?<eos> Nope.<eos> Damn, Linden.<eos> What the hell are you doing here in the middle of the night, sneaking around in the dark?<eos> I was returning the file you forgot at my place.<eos> That's where it was.
Hmm. "Serenity." Mm. Sounds like a stripper's name.<eos> Yeah, actually.<eos> That, okay.<eos> Um, we need to talk.<eos> Toothbrush is the first step. And next, it'll be your clothes.<eos> And then your friends, and then I'm gonna make you get me a ring.<eos> And a dog, because what I really want is a kid, but-- but I don't want to scare you off, so I have to take baby steps.<eos> Seriously, it was an-- an old white-elephant gift.<eos> Did you just, like-- what, y-your old one?<eos> It's right here. It's right here in the drawer.
And something nasty.<eos> The rat probably found something edible in there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Here's two euros.<eos> What for?<eos> For giving you work?<eos> It was in the wash.<eos> Nice washer.<eos> I wonder what it's paying me for.

- Hello.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> - In a moment. The rat's gone.<eos> I almost broke your kitchen lamp with my ball.<eos> Were you upstairs again?<eos> Then you're a magician.<eos> Bye.<eos> -Bye.<eos> Now the rat's here.<eos> And now it's gone.
143/91.<eos> Most of the time, I lay by the pool, reading.<eos> And there was often a man in the pool, doing laps.<eos> I watched him from my lounger.<eos> Even when I didn't want to. I wanted to read.<eos> - Water!<eos> But I couldn't concentrate on the book, because my eyes always wandered back to the pool.<eos> So I...<eos> - The bottle's whistling!<eos> It's singing!

Last time I went to see a movie, I was alone in the theater.<eos> The projectionist showed the film anyway.<eos> I suddenly got the creeps that no one was sitting in front of or behind me.<eos> I took my scarf and put it on. So if somebody cut my throat from behind, the scarf would be between my skin and the knife.<eos> Would you like some more wine?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You have a bloodstain on your shirt.<eos> Yes, true.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm checking whether the wound smells the way it looks.

Oh, please.<eos> We both know I'm just a figurehead here.<eos> You really think they're doing something in there?<eos> He's 12.<eos> He's 14, but it's touching how close you are.<eos> Fine.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You have to keep your door open.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Uh, well, why do you need it closed?
You never know with old people.<eos> Hello?<eos> That thing is attacking my computer.<eos> It's my site.<eos> I sent it to you.<eos> Did you write that?<eos> We came to help you.<eos> Be nice.<eos> We'll get the document back.<eos> What's it called?
If you liked her, why don't you answer "Don't Answer"?<eos> I'll see her, we'll have fun, we'll go out, then we'll fight.<eos> Someone gets hurt, we break up.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> Honestly, it's better to be free and have fun.<eos> Thanks to people like you, you don't need a partner.<eos> I taught you many things, but not to think like that.<eos> You know what I miss most about Adrien?<eos> My era.<eos> It left with him.
It's a good thing we keep watch. - Otherwise...<eos> - We keep watch and we punish.<eos> There you go, this is for you.<eos> - After you, after you too!<eos> - Right.<eos> - There's a kitchen, show them.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Right here. - Look at this kitchen!<eos> - Isn't it great?<eos> - It's spacious.
She's of Puerto Rican descent.<eos> They have a baby, Oscar.<eos> - What does she know?<eos> - That's what we're working on now, sir.<eos> But I can tell you, and you can tell the Attorney General, this is the closest we've come to a live KGB illegal on american soil since we got Rudolf Abel in '57.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, you!<eos> Hey, you!<eos> We got your message. Come with me.<eos> Back it up.
Gueda!<eos> I hope you don't want a quiet life.<eos> I'm interested in the Amazon's plants.<eos> I'm against the dam, if it'll flood them.<eos> - The plants are my job.<eos> - You're a biologist?<eos> Yes.<eos> If you destroy the root, the species dies.<eos> Yes.<eos> The air-con doesn't work. We'll fix it.
What if the promotion is just to keep you quiet?<eos> You're blinded by jealousy.<eos> No. It's often like that.<eos> - OK?<eos> - Yes, OK.<eos> Some people will do you down for helping them.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Well...<eos> Have a look round, and you'll see how it is.<eos> A 50m chain between 2 Caterpillars doesn't cut the trees, it destroys them.
I know, that is like throwing prime rib at a Rottweiler.<eos> Interesting choice of dog.<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> And dangerous.<eos> No offense, Doctor...<eos> Oh, David.<eos> But I don't need a shrink to figure out what my problems are.<eos> You mean running away from tough emotions and throwing yourself into your work?<eos> I read your file.<eos> I hope it was a good read. Mm-hmm.
My name is Elena Gilbert, and I'm a vampire.<eos> I'm learning how to survive, but there are complications.<eos> I know that I'm sired to you, Damon.<eos> You know what would make me happy?<eos> That what you actually felt for me was real.<eos> How together are they?<eos> But there's hope now.<eos> Tell him what the hunter told you the tattoo leads to.<eos> He said there was a cure.<eos> And we're not the only ones who want it...
I didn't.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, that was clever.<eos> I'm sure he'll really appreciate it.<eos> You'd really dagger me?<eos> If I do, Damon's compulsion ends and this is all over.<eos> And then you're no better than Niklaus.<eos> Daggering siblings when you disagree with them... look at what this family has become.<eos> I mean, Elijah won't even show his face he's so disgusted by our bickering.<eos> This cure has ruined us, and it hasn't even been found yet.

What sort of materials did you use?<eos> It's concrete, spruce, laminated wood and glass.<eos> Laminated wood is cool.<eos> I've got a friend who works for a travel magazine.<eos> - The Germans will love this place.<eos> - Germans drown here every year.<eos> Theyjust love boating.<eos> Have you ever told anyone what happened?<eos> You can't carry the load alone.<eos> It's too heavy.
I hope I'm not invading young VIaminck's turf.<eos> No.<eos> Is he related to VIaminck, the...?<eos> DistantIy.<eos> A conventional painter.<eos> Too much sky.<eos> buckle up, Jean-PauI.<eos> Mr. Minister?<eos> Dear Stéphane, I asked Arthur to mellow the New York speech.<eos> Anyway, it's dense and lopsided.

What you have figured out on your own-- cross-species DNA sequencing-- that took our people years.<eos> You would be an asset to our organization.<eos> You make it sound like I have a choice.<eos> Of course you have a choice.<eos> You think we want people working for us who don't believe in our cause?<eos> What cause?<eos> To cover up this creature you've created?<eos> Dr. Marks, you obviously got into this line of work to put away monsters.<eos> This creature is dangerous.<eos> It needs to be contained.
Okay, you got plates?<eos> No, I can't make them out.<eos> If-if anything happens to her, I will never forgive myself.<eos> Okay, we'll find her.<eos> We're just gonna track her phone.<eos> Okay. 212-555-0180.<eos> I need to talk to you about, uh, that creature.<eos> Okay, I got to call you back.<eos> I have a decision to make-- an opportunity, actually-- but it would come at a cost.<eos> And I'm trying to figure out if it'd be worth it.
If you're not going to protect yourself... I will.<eos> I knew I'd find you here.<eos> I brought flowers.<eos> That's how this whole thing started.<eos> I brought flowers to that dinner.<eos> Vincent, you saved Heather's life.<eos> Don't beat yourself up for taking out her killer.<eos> I killed Joe's brother.<eos> You have a brother taken away from you like that, you never stop looking for justice, ever.<eos> That rage, it... it makes you do crazy things.
We found a shell with Automatic Colt Pistol written on it.<eos> No prints on it.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No, no.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I really felt like someone had been in my flat.<eos> Why have you got a gun?<eos> It was a gift, I've never used it.
Ok.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Bye dad.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - Kisses.<eos> - Shit, it wasn't her.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Nothing proves that your gun killed Véronique Parant.<eos> - Did you put it elsewhere?<eos> - No, it was there.
An appointment?<eos> What appointment?<eos> What are you playing at?<eos> Bye, commissioner.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - Actually, I've got something that belongs to you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Come on, let's have a drink.<eos> He implied that he has the gun.<eos> At least we know where it is.
Isa, it's shit when you don't answer.<eos> I wanted to see the end of the film.<eos> That's not bad.<eos> Have you got something to tell me?<eos> How are you?<eos> - Very well.<eos> You?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> What about the shop?<eos> It's good, yeah.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
I'm on the 32nd floor now.<eos> Don't try to push me, Harris. But you need to listen to reason.<eos> How can you expect me to agree to this?<eos> Because it's the right thing to do.<eos> Easy for you to say.<eos> Next time, damn well knock.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was checking the minibar.<eos> I'll save you the trouble.<eos> It's empty.
Yeah, one of your trained killers is leaving his post.<eos> So is the one in the lobby.<eos> He's taking rather a large trunk with him.<eos> I don't know what they could possibly--<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> It's Harris.<eos> - They're disposing of the body.<eos> - Body? What body?<eos> Detective, you can't let them leave the hotel.<eos> The recording, where is it?

Even though I've never been close to the Palme-investigation<eos> - I don't believe in this.<eos> I'm listening, Eriksson.<eos> This is the most exhaustive investigation in Swedish history and the only suspect...<eos> - Is Christer Pettersson.<eos> - Convicted and acquit within a year.<eos> 25 years ago.<eos> It's like Monty Python's parrot sketch.<eos> Eriksson suggests that the investigation is dead.<eos> Maybe it's just tired, as the parrot was.
Have you seen this?<eos> Oh yes.<eos> Those bastards have got real a bee in their bonnet about the bloody vaccine.<eos> But they've named me.<eos> Well, you did buy it, Michael.<eos> In any case, there's nothing we can do about it.<eos> We're tied into the contract.<eos> Well... we're not, actually.<eos> I've found a cancellation clause.<eos> It can be enacted if the department's total spend with the supplier is over 240 million.
You did exactly the right thing.<eos> So, I-I-I want a sample of the vaccine.<eos> I-I-I'm sure you understand, with the events of last night.<eos> So, this is an R680 request...<eos> Excellent, yes.<eos> You want a sample.<eos> Yes, it's all filled.<eos> It's all in order.<eos> The paperwork is...<eos> What do you want it for?
And on my end,<eos> I have a really strong shot at a Twix bar.<eos> It's a great day.<eos> Of course.<eos> I have to go to work soon.<eos> Can you read me the article?<eos> The rest of the world got to read your story before I did.<eos> Our story.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. Here it goes.
Mr. Gold, I... I... I told you before, I...<eos> I don't remember you. I... I...<eos> I know. It's just, uh... Sweetheart, I...<eos> I'm, uh... I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry. I know that you're... you're confused about who you are.<eos> So I'm gonna tell ya.<eos> You are a hero who helped your people.<eos> You're a beautiful woman who loved an ugly man.<eos> Really, really loved me.<eos> You find goodness in others. And when it's not there, you create it.
No one else seems to think Silas exists.<eos> So why do you?<eos> I used to run with some witches in Africa in the 14th century,<eos> Haiti in the 17th century,<eos> New Orleans in the 1900s.<eos> They all knew about Silas and that he needed to stay buried. I actually hold witches in high esteem.<eos> Yeah, but why Silas?<eos> Why are you so afraid of him?<eos> They said if Silas rises, he'll unleash hell on earth.<eos> I happen to like earth just the way it is.
They obviously haven't got a clue what's going on.<eos> No cabbie is gonna stop if you blow a whistle at them.<eos> Cabs have been hailed this way for decades because this is the most efficient way to hail a cab.<eos> The murder of Todd Clarke makes me more certain than ever that someone is killing anyone with knowledge of the Red Team's plans.<eos> I'm just not certain it's Army Intelligence anymore.<eos> Who else knew the names of the Red Team?<eos> See?<eos> Not stopping.<eos> The list could have worked its way up the chain of command.<eos> It could have leaked to another agency.
Fine.<eos> You know, I'd heard rumors of two prostitutes who bind innocent whoremongers and then rob them.<eos> But to think that those two women ended up in my home on-on this very evening...<eos> I suppose I should thank you.<eos> I usually investigate crimes of a more... homicidal nature, but it's been an uneventful few days.<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> Just one question before you leave.<eos> Can I keep these?<eos> I'm glad your bust was such a success last night, but this place still smells like stripper.<eos> Does it?
So, your docket's still open today?<eos> Sadly, yes.<eos> Well, my landlord called.<eos> I have to go to my apartment this morning.<eos> I think my subletter has been throwing parties or playing loud music or something.<eos> I confess, Watson. I find your insistence on maintaining your own residence puzzling.<eos> As a live-in sobriety counselor, you could, in theory, live rent-free in the most expensive city in the world indefinitely.<eos> Why not embrace the fact that you are a professional nomad and give the place up?<eos> 'Cause I love my apartment.<eos> It's my sanctum sanctorum.
And then I remembered that this place is rent-controlled, so if I violate my lease, you can evict me, and then you can charge market-value for this place.<eos> I'm hardly the only guy, with electrical tape.<eos> No, but you know the actors in that movie they work a lot and there not hard to track down.<eos> They all confirmed that you were here the whole time.<eos> You participated in the filming of an unlicensed production.<eos> That is against the law.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you and Cooper to pay for all of my stuff to be put in storage until I find a new place.<eos> I also want 1200 dollars for that couch.<eos> Because after everything it's been through in that movie, it needs to be taken out back and shot.
It's ideal for stashing a kidnapped girl.<eos> Holmes shared a theory with me.<eos> He thinks Emily's being kept in a pre-war building in close proximity to an Ethiopian restaurant.<eos> Right now, I've got a small army of cops searching the aforementioned buildings.<eos> Now, personally, I think it's just a matter of time before they find her.<eos> But considering that she needs medical attention, I would prefer it be sooner rather than later.<eos> Now, if you'd like to reconsider the D.A.'s generous offer, you know where we'll be.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> You'd think after everything I've done to my liver, it could deflect a couple of bullets, huh?
It might be today or tomorrow, the doctors can't say for sure.<eos> Goddammit, at least he'll die happy.<eos> Why did he have to get his dick wet at that hour?<eos> He got what he deserved for never sharing his Viagra.<eos> I doubt someone put a hit on him.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Brand name really adds class, I can't see shit!<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> Where's the bag?<eos> Here it is.
Waltin called and explained that SÄPO needed to confiscate a certain weapon.<eos> It was a matter of national security.<eos> I was sworn to secrecy about this.<eos> Well, we forced you then.<eos> If anyone asks, you had a gun to your head.<eos> Levin, get a service weapon.<eos> He wanted the ballistics for the gun, and asked me to fabricate a scrapping-order.<eos> - Oops. - All traces of the gun had to disappear.<eos> I did as I was told, and two weeks later, I got the medal.<eos> It was handed over during a fancy dinner at Waltin's.
- I love you, Lyndsey. What really made you change your mind?<eos> All right, here we go. The fact that while you could certainly do better, there's no way I ever could.<eos> Alan, that is so sweet.<eos> And so true. So I know Herb and Walden, but who's the lesbian in the bathrobe?<eos> Sorry about kidnapping you.<eos> Aw, don't worry about it.<eos> It was never gonna work with Lyndsey and me.<eos> Outside of her vagina, we have nothing in common.<eos> Doctor to doctor, can I ask you a medical question?<eos> Is it beautiful?
Do you mind?<eos> What is going on?<eos> First your family goes AWOL, and now the department is treating you like some criminal.<eos> Captain Elwood's just doing what he's supposed to do.<eos> Everybody is.<eos> Just try to stay calm, all right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you move my lockbox?<eos> No.<eos> Did you tell the boys where it was?

- Wait one second.<eos> One second.<eos> Now keep in mind, the site is still under construction, but you'll just have to use a little imagination.<eos> Before we go in there, I'd like to, uh...<eos> Okay, right this way.<eos> And, uh, watch your step please.<eos> Last month, I had to do a cardiac cath on a patient with no signs of heart disease.<eos> It's putting the patient at risk for no reason.<eos> Forget physician advocacy.<eos> It doesn't exist.
You're not going anywhere.<eos> I deserve my vengeance.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right, you do.<eos> And with the Dark One gone, we can search for the one magical item that can actually kill him here.<eos> His dagger.<eos> No Baelfire.<eos> Yeah, that probably wouldn't fly as an alias.<eos> Your magic globe didn't give you an apartment number?<eos> It doesn't work that way.
- Servants don't wear crowns.<eos> - Enough. - I'm sorry, Your Majesty...<eos> - No, I was talking to Snow.<eos> Me?<eos> I thought I raised you better than that, Snow.<eos> It doesn't matter whether one is a servant or royalty.<eos> Everyone in the kingdom deserves our love and respect.<eos> - But she took my tiara...<eos> - She apologized.<eos> And it isn't yours yet.
If we can put some doubt in her about Cora's motives, it might slow them down.<eos> And you think she'll just trust you?<eos> Well, she doesn't need to trust me.<eos> She just has to listen to me.<eos> And I know how to get her to do that.<eos> So, uh... - You like pizza?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> L-let me guess.<eos> You're gonna tell me the best pizza's in New York and I gotta try it, right?<eos> Actually, it's in the Kingdom of Damarian on the north shore of the Dragon Fields of Zorn.

Then why are you dressed like that?<eos> Because, duh, I'm helping Krieger turn Ray into a stupid cyborg.<eos> A What?<eos> But I guess some cyborgs are smart.<eos> Wait, what are you talking about?<eos> You gotta be pretty smart to fool the old Voight-Kampff machine.<eos> In Krieger's lab?<eos> Anywhere, duh, it's portable.<eos> No, no, no! Uh-<eos> - Yes, it is.
I just want you to stay with me.<eos> You said you liked it here.<eos> You want to stay here, don't you?<eos> Not like this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted us to be happy.<eos> Henry?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm getting rid of magic.<eos> It's ruining everything.
If you wanna kill Mary Margaret, you're gonna have to go through us.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Stop! - Henry, get out of the way!<eos> Not until someone helps me destroy magic!<eos> There's no way to get rid of it.<eos> You can't just blow it up. Magic isn't the problem, kid.<eos> It's her.<eos> It's not just her, it's everyone!<eos> Look what magic did to Mary Margaret.<eos> Look at what it did to you!

Not my mind.<eos> My heart.<eos> After what I did to Cora, I think restoring our land is the best way to mend it.<eos> It'll be good for all of us, the whole family.<eos> Henry... and you.<eos> We're from there.<eos> You're from there.<eos> No.<eos> This world is... my home.<eos> And it's been nothing but cruel to you.
No.<eos> That comes later.<eos> I need something close to your heart.<eos> Something that cannot be replaced.<eos> This?<eos> It's worthless.<eos> The pendant, perhaps.<eos> But the string?<eos> It was the string your father used to animate you as a freshly carved puppet.<eos> In a way, it first gave you life.

Are you like me?<eos> Magical? No.<eos> I'm quite human.<eos> But forget for a second why I'm here and who I am.<eos> And instead, ask yourself the more important question.<eos> My cancer was a death sentence, remember?<eos> Yet, here I am.<eos> The Dragon.<eos> The liquid in the bottle, it worked.<eos> It cured me, August.

Your photograph. It's on the desk.<eos> Do not forget to take it when you leave.<eos> I'm not going anywhere until I get the truth.<eos> Interesting choice of words from someone who lied about being sick.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't have cancer.<eos> And yet you sought me out.<eos> I've been searching for someone like you for a very long time.<eos> For magic.<eos> It's rare in this world.
A few weeks ago, right about the time you got here, this shadow, it came to the window.<eos> Only it's not attached to a body.<eos> And it can do so many wonderful things, like change its shape and fly and travel between worlds.<eos> And do you know why?<eos> Because it has magic.<eos> Whatever you do, promise me you'll never open that window again.<eos> Promise me you won't talk to the Shadow.<eos> - Don't be silly.<eos> - Magic is dangerous.<eos> It always comes with a price.
Right, Regina?<eos> (WHIRRING AND CRACKLING STOPS) (WEAKLY) You have no idea who you're dealing with.<eos> Actually, no, you have no idea who you are dealing with.<eos> A couple of fools in over their heads who go around stealing magic?<eos> Stealing magic? (CHUCKLES)<eos> That's what you think we're here to do?<eos> We're not here to steal magic.<eos> We're here to destroy it.<eos> Magic does not belong in this world.<eos> It's unholy.
We're everhere, Regina.<eos> See, after I left Storybrooke, as a boy, I was babbling about magic. About what I had seen.<eos> And what had happened to my father.<eos> Now, most folks, they wrote me off.<eos> But some didn't.<eos> And they found me.<eos> They?<eos> Believers.<eos> People that know that magic is real.<eos> And that it doesn't belong in this world.
The Shadow won't let them.<eos> There's a reason it's called Neverland.<eos> Because once you set foot on its soil, the Shadow never lets you leave.<eos> How did you escape?<eos> He let me go.<eos> Because he didn't want me.<eos> He wanted a boy.<eos> He's coming back tonight to take one of my brothers in my place.<eos> You said magic was bad and you were right, Bae.<eos> It's going to destroy my family.

Yeah, we're fine.<eos> We found Regina. But Mendell, he's coming your way.<eos> Greg Mendell?<eos> So I was right.<eos> It wasn't Tamara.<eos> Actually, it was.<eos> I just had some help.<eos> What are you doing, Tamara?<eos> I have to keep magic out of this world, Neal.<eos> It doesn't belong here.

NARRATOR: Previously on Once Upon A Time...<eos> Someone killed him to stop him from telling us something.<eos> You want to use the beans to go back to the enchanted forest.<eos> We can start over, Emma.<eos> REGINA: You're hiding something. I'm going to find out.<eos> OWEN: Now, you were able to get the package here, right?<eos> TAMARA: It's right outside town.
We're here.<eos> So your sacred cause is pilfering a dwarf's pickaxe?<eos> Regina... had this in her pocket when you turned her over to us.<eos> It's a trigger, and this axe, according to our people, is what activates it.<eos> You're going to destroy an entire town and kill everyone in it...<eos> Yeah, including your enemy.<eos> Rumplestiltskin won't be immune to this?<eos> None of your kind will be.<eos> Once this thing gets activated, nothing can shut it off.<eos> This whole town will revert to the forest it was.
Well, then how will you find your way back to me?<eos> You're not coming back, are you?<eos> The prophecy.<eos> The boy is my undoing.<eos> But he's also my grandson.<eos> I must save him.<eos> I must do this to honor Baelfire.<eos> He's gone.<eos> And I didn't even get the chance to say good-bye.<eos> I understand, but I also know... that the future isn't always what it seems.
What do you want?<eos> My organization has been contracted to eliminate a certain high profile individual.<eos> A very well-guarded target.<eos> Well, forget it.<eos> Look, I'm retired.<eos> To drink and smoke your life away?<eos> We all got to die some time.<eos> I need someone to die at the right time.<eos> And no one does it better than you.<eos> My vision... ain't exactly what it used to be.
As you can imagine, that was not an easy pill to swallow.<eos> The guy who refused to serve a meat course at our wedding.<eos> I can't--I can't orchestrate 3 massacres.<eos> It isn't like that.<eos> You're merely leading these people So silas can bring them back from the dead.<eos> Why--why should they die just to be resurrected?<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> The spell that brings me back Requires a witch to channel An extreme amount of mystical energy.<eos> Energy that doesn't occur in nature.<eos> Because it isn't natural.
They were married for ten years. Two kids.<eos> A six-year-old and the toddler we saw with the sister at the parade.<eos> The sister was her chief of staff.<eos> Maybe a radical political organization, an opponent, a whack job.<eos> It seems to me there's a lot easier ways to kill a state Senator.<eos> No, I was thinking the same thing.<eos> Small staff, no bodyguards.<eos> What did she make, like 60k a year?<eos> 61,132 dollars and 99 cents.<eos> Okay, I came upstairs to tell you that the bullet fragmented when it hit the skull.
Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> Give up your half of the 3-D printer?<eos> Yes.<eos> And can you please make that out to Bernadette?<eos> I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.<eos> Wow, that's harsh.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Aren't you gonna eat lunch?<eos> Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokémon cards.<eos> Well, the equation balances, but it's certainly not elegant.
I know, but you don't deserve it.<eos> Philip, stop.<eos> You are not my daddy.<eos> No, I'm not your daddy.<eos> I'm your husband, Elizabeth.<eos> What do you think husbands do?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Henry, where's your thermos?<eos> It's in the lunchbox, isn't it?<eos> No, it's not.
But there's no way to get through it without the truth.<eos> What "truth" exactly are we talking about?<eos> In New York, Philip was with the woman we assigned him to.<eos> I can think of five different reasons you'd poison our life.<eos> Ask Philip, then.<eos> I did.<eos> You believe him?<eos> If you start to think of your marriage as real, it doesn't work.<eos> The men don't think of them that way.<eos> It was an arrangement.
Zhukov was right.<eos> We can't do our jobs if we're emotional.<eos> What happened tonight has nothing to do with emotion.<eos> It did for me.<eos> My head was somewhere else.<eos> Where?<eos> Us.<eos> Philip, we have to stop this.<eos> We were never married.<eos> We had an arrangement, and it worked.
But they're not alone.<eos> The rains have also created a plague.<eos> These are armoured ground crickets.<eos> Giant insects, with voracious appetites... for meat.<eos> With the quelea parents away feeding, their chicks are defenceless.<eos> The adults return.<eos> But the cricket fights back.<eos> Squirting its own foul-tasting blood into their eyes.<eos> The cricket is still alive, but the stench of its blood attracts the attention of others.<eos> Now, it is the target.
Bring me the briefcase and we'll talk, okay?<eos> Beckwith will have an exact time of death soon, but 'til then, I say we ballpark two, three days, see who's missing.<eos> And fingerprints, what, a couple days?<eos> Yeah, you know the lab.<eos> Hopefully, overnight.<eos> Look, Art, um, this shit with Paul is about to go sideways, okay?<eos> I need to get to the bank.<eos> Let me see your weapon.<eos> Huh?<eos> Come on, show it to me.
Yeah.<eos> Your task is more difficult, since the real Beth Childs shot our friend Maggie Chen.<eos> The copies, they're harder to find.<eos> Maybe we could use the imposter.<eos> I'd like to see her again.<eos> Tomas.<eos> It will say anything to justify itself.<eos> I'll be strong.<eos> The path to the Shepherd is through the sheep.<eos> Find the impostor, bleed it for what it knows, then kill it.
It's how they tell you apart.<eos> Okay. But how to decode it?<eos> I have four nucleotides to work with...<eos> G, C, T, and A...<eos> And no idea how they're encrypted.<eos> I mean, there's thousands of permutations and we're running out of time.<eos> Yes, but I know your tag number.<eos> You do?<eos> Yes, I saw it many times. It's numeric, so, if we know how that translates, then we can figure out the rest.<eos> Okay. What is it?
I lost Daniel.<eos> You know, you were right about everything you said yesterday, except one thing.<eos> You're not alone in this, and you never will be.<eos> From the moment we're born, we're drawn to form a union with others...<eos> An abiding drive to connect, to love, to belong.<eos> In a perfect union, we find the strength we cannot find in ourselves.<eos> Jack?<eos> Hey, Jack. Come in, it's Dec.<eos> But the strength of the union cannot be known...<eos> Jack, look, I know you're... Until it is tested.
Holy shit, you're right.<eos> The astronaut.<eos> The astronaut.<eos> And what was he flying?<eos> - Helicopter.<eos> - A helicopter.<eos> Mr. Augustine, this astronaut came to see us in high school.<eos> He landed a helicopter right on the baseball diamond.<eos> A Deputy U.S. Marshal is gonna gun up and hole out in a school?<eos> It's in the town of Evarts.
She's a hero.<eos> She's a defender of the unborn.<eos> Jeez, that sounds like a bad X-Men movie.<eos> What'd you do, bomb an abortion clinic?<eos> And you can sign off with, "I will be out of here by 201 5,<eos> "before the rapture." Oh, man.<eos> Is something fucking funny to you?<eos> Yeah. It's just that people predict the rapture all the time.<eos> I mean, wasn't that supposed to happen in 201 1?<eos> No. It comes in two stages. If you study your shit.
So go fuck yourself!<eos> Happy Thanksgiving, Chapman.<eos> Where's my mattress?<eos> Where the fuck is my mattress?<eos> What did you do to it?<eos> Fucking crackhead.<eos> My bunkie stole my mattress.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And?<eos> It's gone.
Happy Thanksgiving, Chapman.<eos> Where's my mattress?<eos> Where the fuck is my mattress?<eos> What did you do to it?<eos> Fucking crackhead.<eos> My bunkie stole my mattress.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And?<eos> It's gone.<eos> It's not there.
We had the same foster family.<eos> Look, I ain't getting my ass in trouble letting some ex-con stay in my house.<eos> But I have to stay here. This is the address I gave my supervisor.<eos> The system gonna come check on me.<eos> That ain't my problem.<eos> I ain't got nowhere else to stay at.<eos> Shit.<eos> You can sleep in that corner.<eos> On the floor.<eos> Leave that mattress where it is.
I don't talk to cops.<eos> Look, no one's got to find out that you're talking to me.<eos> Goldie's got a room in his place- in his bedroom.<eos> - Goldie? Who's Goldie?<eos> Some nobody, nothin' pimp!<eos> I think he's got her there.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> 'Cause I was there.<eos> I heard someone crying behind the door.<eos> It was locked. I couldn't get in.
I have no words for how disappointed I am in you for behaving like this.<eos> What? I know all about Shelby's financial troubles.<eos> You do?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Shelby and I, we-we have an open and an honest relationship.<eos> In fact, she was the one who insisted on a prenup if we got married-- to ensure that you and your sister would not be saddled with her... her so-called "fiscal cliff""<eos> I better not lose my RAV4 over this.<eos> (sighs)<eos> Found the lockbox.<eos> Turns out it wasn't stolen after all.
Give it to him.<eos> What are friends for?<eos> Is that the solution?<eos> Go see a therapist with Zeynep.<eos> A therapist?<eos> What are you talking about? For God's sake, are you crazy?<eos> You are really overdoing it. Buddy, hold up.<eos> I'm going to provide you with some medicine.<eos> And...<eos> Here it is.
Uh, Ray Sheckman.<eos> You're even cuter than in your photo.<eos> You're on the charity's board, right?<eos> The Youth Education Initiative?<eos> Yeah. That's what this is all about.<eos> Got to get drunk for the kids.<eos> You're so funny.<eos> You know what the one bad thing about this party is?<eos> What's that?<eos> I'll make it right. I wanted to see the Asian gallery exhibit, but it's closed.
I don't need forever.<eos> Just long enough to find the man behind the curtain, the one who gave the kill order.<eos> You won't even scratch the surface of their organization, and you'll still be in grave danger.<eos> You hold a piece of a puzzle, a secret so important that they were willing to kill<eos> Dr. Aquino and your friend Michael Cole and yourself to protect it.<eos> The truth about a group of people you call Research.<eos> Something that Cole had begun to suspect.<eos> - Which is what?<eos> - That they don't exist.<eos> The world looks like it did ten years ago, but underneath, it's become very strange indeed.
I asked him to come at the normal time.<eos> Now, I know we all think Ed can be a pain at times, but deep down I think we all care about him and don't want to see him suffer, right?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We're gonna have him put down.<eos> No, we're not gonna have Ed destroyed.<eos> - But...<eos> I'm just gonna be trying a new technique on him.<eos> But in order for it to work, I need you all to participate.<eos> You're gonna be taking placebo pills.<eos> I'm gonna tell Ed that it's been proven to decrease anger and negativity while filling you with a sense of euphoria and love for your fellow man.
Oh, you stupid bitch.<eos> Ladies!<eos> I - I will kill you.<eos> I will kill you!<eos> Ladies.<eos> So what is this place?<eos> It's my office.<eos> It's your office, huh?<eos> And all these Military-issue assault weapons I see, they're for your new militia or what?<eos> There's no militia. It was dissolved in 2009.
- A flirty one?<eos> - No, a guide.<eos> I make tours between Sadovaya subway and Culture Park daily.<eos> Your attention, please!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, our train is approaching the legendary station "Borodinskaï", built in 1948.<eos> This is a secret part of the metro.<eos> This station leads directly, to Stalin dacha...<eos> Thank you.<eos> In 1950, work resumed at the station, to integrate it with the first line of the Moscow Metro.<eos> This station is now closed, because it was built in an unstable area.
- Shut it!<eos> - There are people here!<eos> - Close the gates!<eos> Are there people with you?<eos> Close the door, dammit!<eos> - Make a decision, close the damn gate!<eos> - Close the gates!<eos> Unit 18, answer.<eos> Where can they be?<eos> If you were told to close the door, it has to be near Borodinskaïa.
- Yes, my lord.<eos> Did you sleep?<eos> But I dreamed, cardinal.<eos> You dreamt without sleeping?<eos> Now, that is miraculous.<eos> Call it a waking dream.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I dreamed of a vast conspiracy encircling our beloved Vatican.<eos> It has its roots in the hills of the Romagna in the great families that would claim St. Peter's as their own.<eos> And its tendrils spread like writhing serpents through the streets of Rome breaking inside the Vatican walls where it becomes a many-headed hydra and each head wears a cardinal's hat.
You can't tell from there.<eos> - Is this a game?<eos> - It is a game of want and wanting.<eos> The toes are splayed a little.<eos> - God has made better feet, I'm sure.<eos> - Not that I have found.<eos> - You are a connoisseur of feet?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I have found none better.<eos> My calf. Is it elegant?

Tell her to come here.<eos> She'll see it with her own eyes.<eos> - And Nitya?<eos> - She's at her parents'.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> She gets on well with the girls.<eos> - You lost my American barrette.<eos> I put it right there. Is that how you take care of the things you borrow?<eos> Don't get mad.<eos> - Here it is.
We've missed you around here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> After what happened to my family, I, uh... didn't really see a reason to come back, you know.<eos> Um, so what is this?<eos> This... this is for your own protection.<eos> How?<eos> I mean, they're shoving us into a courthouse.<eos> No one's telling us any...<eos> There's been a terrorist threat.<eos> I think it's coming here.
Yellow-billed kites.<eos> Pied crows.<eos> But so many of these hatchlings appear together, that predators can't catch them all.<eos> Last out, this baby might seem doomed.<eos> But struggling out late could just give her a chance.<eos> The crows seem insatiable.<eos> Even those that reach the sea aren't safe.<eos> This female has to make a dash for it.<eos> She's still in danger, and not just from above.<eos> A ghost crab may be smaller than the hatchling, but it has the strength to drag her into its lair.
His egg will not survive.<eos> He's not the only one to give up.<eos> Some years, not a single chick is reared.<eos> Penguins are adapted to withstand temperatures of 40 degrees below zero, not 40 degrees above.<eos> Now, at the hottest part of the day, the very worst time, her chicks are hatching.<eos> Just when they need her most, she's reaching the limit of her endurance.<eos> After 10 days of intensive fishing, the chicks' father comes back to take his turn at the nest.<eos> But will he be too late?<eos> He greets his young for the very first time.<eos> The coolness of the Benguela Current brought the penguins here but that very coolness is a great disadvantage, because it generates little rain.

Under its intense gaze, the snow can't last for long.<eos> Melt water should bring life to the lowlands.<eos> Hundreds of torrents cascade southwards.<eos> But each is flowing towards extinction.<eos> Just 200 miles south of the mountains, the rivers are vaporised.<eos> Life has been burnt off the land.<eos> This was the apocalypse from which the Barbary macaques fled.<eos> The sudden and unstoppable advance of the greatest desert on the planet.<eos> The Sahara transformed North Africa.<eos> Today, it covers an area the size of the United States.
They're tiny, each weighing the same as a couple of one pound coins, yet the journey to their breeding grounds in Europe is over 3,000 miles long.<eos> Ahead of them lies a vast death trap.<eos> The Sahara is too large to go around.<eos> The swallows have no choice but to meet it head-on.<eos> It will take one of nature's greatest feats of navigation to cross this lifeless wasteland.<eos> A wilderness that stretches not just to the horizon, but almost beyond imagination.<eos> It's an immense blank space on the map.<eos> In spite of the Sahara's reputation, less than one-fifth of it is sand.<eos> The rest is stone and wind-scoured rock.<eos> The sun not only bakes the land, it warps its appearance.
They log every change of direction, every footstep, in order to know exactly where they are and where their nest lies.<eos> Only four minutes to spare, and they've found a victim of heatstroke.<eos> A meal.<eos> But it's going to take a monumental effort to get it home.<eos> Three minutes to go and they're nearing their maximum temperature, an astounding 53 degrees Celsius.<eos> But there are already casualties.<eos> One minute left, and they're not going to make it.<eos> Something has to change.<eos> The silver ant is the hardiest of all desert inhabitants.<eos> Even so, it can only survive outside in the middle of the day for a matter of minutes.

The people protecting rhinos in Africa are striving to ensure that we'll still be able to witness wonderful scenes like this in 50 years' time.<eos> Right across Africa, conservationists have realised that if we want to save our big animals, then now is the time.<eos> The human population of the continent has just exceeded one billion, and many wild animals are being hunted commercially for food.<eos> Some legally. But many illegally.<eos> Wildlife meat is often sold as goat or beef.<eos> The amount is astonishing.<eos> Millions of tonnes are eaten across Africa every year.<eos> At this rate, some species are almost certainly heading for extinction.<eos> But commercial hunting is not just affecting the grazers.<eos> As the prey decreases, it's affecting the predators, too.
The future of Africa's forests has never been more critical for us all.<eos> But the consequences of global warming aren't limited to the land.<eos> Africa is almost completely surrounded by oceans.<eos> Here on the east coast, there are animals feeling the change in climate in a most surprising way.<eos> This is a young female green turtle.<eos> During her lifetime, she will travel thousands of miles, through the ocean, looking for food.<eos> Turtles return to the same beach from which they hatched to lay their own eggs.<eos> The eggs are buried in the sand, and the hatchlings will emerge after about two months.<eos> Now, there's a strange thing, about turtle eggs, and that is the temperature at which the eggs are kept will determine the sex of most of the hatchlings.<eos> If the sand temperature is high, they will be female. If it's low, they will be male.
Nick!<eos> Rhodey died!<eos> Right in front of me!<eos> And so did a lot of other people.<eos> Who the hell were these guys?<eos> All their signals were blocked by a very powerful electromagnetic field.<eos> I was hoping you could give us some guidance.<eos> He was a smartass kid.<eos> His armor was weird.<eos> It was very advanced, I'll tell you that is something I've never seen before.
However, it's still early in the game.<eos> I'll be preparing another offensive.<eos> Tony Stark.<eos> Tony Stark.<eos> He seems to be in possession of a wide range of technological icons.<eos> And one of the high-tech graven images these people place on an altar to worship, is his new satellite.<eos> -He's the high priest of technology.<eos> -Yes.<eos> But it's a conceited and foolish misunderstanding.<eos> technology and the people who give birth to it are nothing more than false idols, leading society to disaster.
System error detected.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Synthetic alloys and unknown biological entities have invaded the system.<eos> Technovores.<eos> Power source and all sensors have been compromised.<eos> Technovores?<eos> This armor is pretty well made.<eos> Who do you think made it?<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> For someone like you, it's good.
Was that an accident?<eos> Norma, did your son kill Keith?<eos> No, no.<eos> No, of course not, no.<eos> Is there anything else you wanna say?<eos> What could I possibly say?<eos> Look, I know that you have spent your life taking care of other people.<eos> But you're making their problems yours.<eos> You're carrying that weight.<eos> And you wear that like armor, but the truth is it is weighing you down.
I was talking about 'Angry Bird'.<eos> Bro...<eos> Look, uncle.<eos> Until yesterday, you were in power.<eos> But today, the five administrators of Dilerkot are under my control.<eos> I'll have no problem in getting Elected to Parliament.<eos> Before we start campaigning I want you to get Simrit and me married.<eos> That will put an end to this family feud, bloodshed...<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Or it will start all over again.
They wouldn't let me clean it.<eos> That day I realized, that the filth in my country has landed me in this mess.<eos> If scum like AK aren't cleaned up then someday he'll be in the same position as a politician that back then led me in that mess.<eos> That's when I decided in that jail, The war outside comes later, first I need to clean-up the mess inside.<eos> I'll start here, and finish there.<eos> We're here, and the bridge is back there.<eos> We'll walk through the jungle, parallel to the bridge.<eos> They won't dare to come on the highway. They'll walk through the jungle.<eos> We'll walk through the jungle 2- 3 kilometers parallel to the highway...<eos> We'll go on the highway only when it'll look safe.
I just wanted to apologize to you both for yesterday.<eos> It was a good idea, just didn't have the right execution.<eos> - What are you saying? - I'm saying it was a good idea, but the questions were being asked of the wrong person.<eos> Three on one.<eos> All for a deposition of little, old me.<eos> Would you be more comfortable over there, where your old desk used to be?<eos> No need.<eos> We won't be here long.<eos> Our confidentiality agreement prohibits most questions.<eos> Actually, it only prohibits disclosures.
What?<eos> I looked at some of Andre's files tonight.<eos> His first parole hearing was June 2009, one month after Mickey Hudson was busted for planting evidence.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> It fits.<eos> Your place is immaculate.<eos> Your sock drawer is immaculate.<eos> You're a straight shooter in every corner of your life, and your frustration with Andre because he wouldn't talk...<eos> I don't see why it matters.<eos> It matters, Detective. Did you earn the favor by informing on your boss or not?
We're so proud of you.<eos> Congratulations, Barnum!<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you!<eos> - What is the moral of your story?<eos> - That everyone is big enough inside.<eos> - Do you have any literary idols?<eos> - I guess Hamsun.<eos> Let's see that diploma.<eos> Hold it up.
It's not butter. It's cheap.<eos> It has no smell.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Keep going.<eos> People hate it.<eos> Hold on a second. Who hates margarine?<eos> You said there were no wrong answers.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - I don't hate it.<eos> It was invented for Napoleon III because armies need to move and it never spoiled.
- Anyway, that's what I want.<eos> What about you?<eos> What's your bright spot?<eos> They told me to come here.<eos> The whole point for me is that you have something in your lives worth living for.<eos> Focus on your future.<eos> I bought her a horse magazine.<eos> But it got dirty.<eos> Oh, that one.<eos> She's got it.
Well, that was a coincidence.<eos> You both did above average, but not excellent work.<eos> Come on.<eos> My kid's never got a C in her life, let alone a D. - Have you read her essay?<eos> - I don't have to.<eos> I know what my kid's capable of.<eos> Well, I brought it with me to discuss with you because I was concerned about it.<eos> Read it.<eos> "A Long Day's Journey Into Night<eos> "is a play about a journey, a very important journey "that goes so long it eventually turns into night."
As fond as I am of the Japanese culture, I could go the rest of my life without hearing "Chiizu" again.<eos> Japanese for "Say cheese"?<eos> Among other things.<eos> Hello, Mozzie.<eos> Is that James?<eos> You're on speaker.<eos> James, what happened?<eos> He was going stir-crazy.<eos> At my cabin?<eos> But it's so picturesque.
I know.<eos> And this is for the Pueblo.<eos> Cyril, hit the deck. - Wait.<eos> Why just--?<eos> Get some, you sons of bitches. Get some!<eos> Aw, man, I totally missed it.<eos> Oh, my God, the toilet?<eos> No.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Although it is clogged.
Has social media so eroded our interpersonal relationships that we no longer wish to experience the...<eos> - You wanted to keep the stamp?<eos> - They're 46 cents now.<eos> It's getting out of hand.<eos> "Your invitation is joyfully accepted by Mr. Ted Mosby and Jeanette.<eos> Kids, as you'll recall, Jeanette was the last girl I dated before I met your mother.<eos> My friends only had one tiny problem with her.<eos> She was nuts.<eos> So you're bringing a plus one?<eos> If you count the voices in her head, it's plus five.
Wow.<eos> See, I told you.<eos> Thank God I snuck in this bag of goodness.<eos> There's Strickland Stevens. Wow.<eos> Even his scarf is up-and-coming.<eos> Are you gonna be okay by yourself for a few minutes?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Well, you're sitting on an $80,000 sculpture.<eos> For 80 grand, you'd think it would be more comfortable.
She hasn't sat on a single piece of art.<eos> You're gonna ride this thing out with dignity for Lily.<eos> Not one more thing that might embarrass her.<eos> I will simply stand here.<eos> Perfectly invisible.<eos> And so I dedicate this show to my grandmother's memory.<eos> Now... please join me in honoring her with 60 seconds of absolute silence.<eos> Okay, Neruda, this play is extremely complicated.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Does it involve me saying "my penis" in a Scottish accent?
A long time.<eos> This is all that I have left of her.<eos> A gift I gave her for her 16th birthday.<eos> We took that first thing that morning.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> She was.<eos> When the police gave it back to me, it had some blood on it.<eos> I wonder if it was the killer's.<eos> Wishful thinking, huh?<eos> The police took a DNA sample, but it was too small to test.
I gave her her first lesson.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> It was a disaster.<eos> She thinks that I'm a terrible driver.<eos> Well, you are.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm a very careful and skilled...<eos> Litigator.<eos> As for driving, you have no patience, you yell at other drivers like they can hear you, you use the horn liberally...<eos> Well, that's what it's there for, to warn people.
It wasn't on your copy.<eos> Oddly enough, it wasn't on ours either.<eos> Mike managed to find the original.<eos> We'll need time to review this.<eos> Review it? He wrote it.<eos> You knew she couldn't have children.<eos> That's why you changed her review, and that's why you promoted her.<eos> And when she sees it, she'll join the suit, and you won't stand a chance.<eos> That email doesn't prove a pattern.<eos> - It proves what he did to her.
- of committing a crime?<eos> - No. In prior cases, it's been clear.<eos> At least... it's been clear to me that he has some sort of vigilante complex.<eos> He only strikes when an assault is being perpetrated against an innocent victim.<eos> Carriage driver had priors, Cat.<eos> But he wasn't in the act of...<eos> And what is your answer to the brutality of the crime fitting his M.O. to the T?<eos> Have we considered the possibility that it might be a copycat?<eos> You come up with that theory on your three-hour run, Chandler?<eos> Give it a rest, Garnett.
I'm not saying he's a saint, but he did save a woman from being raped.<eos> What about Joe's brother?<eos> And how convinced are you that this isn't the work of the vigilante?<eos> Based on the messiness of the crime scene and the amount of blood... he's usually more efficient than that.<eos> Do I detect a tone of admiration?<eos> You detect a note of skepticism.<eos> I'm worried that we all want to catch this guy so badly that we're willing to overlook the facts on the ground.<eos> I wanted you on this task force, Chandler.<eos> I thought your life experience would've sharpened your world view.<eos> Maybe it's only clouded it. I thought your life experience
Actually, having dual careers has put a lot of stress on our marriage.<eos> Hence the separate rooms. But I think this trip is really gonna change all that.<eos> My husband will finally see me not as a world-famous police detective, but as a woman.<eos> Your husband's a lucky man.<eos> That he is.<eos> Mm.<eos> Tastes of bog.<eos> You see? It's funny because it's clear.<eos> Actually I would like to say something.<eos> I am friends with a couple of huge Inspector Spacetime fans, and I think what they like about the show is that it's smart, complicated, and doesn't talk down to its audience.
We have a problem, Joe.<eos> We're... royally screwed.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey. National Guard's en route.<eos> Meanwhile, the State Police are manning the roadblocks.<eos> Coast Guard is monitoring the waterways.<eos> We've got two choppers in the air, DC's sending more. Okay.<eos> So what about the Sheriff's residence?<eos> It's a small apartment in town.<eos> It's basically empty.
Say what you want about New York, all right?<eos> But that town ain't got nothing on the Windy City when it comes to pizza pie.<eos> That's another reason why we should hate those Overlord bastards.<eos> About 20 miles or so to go.<eos> So far, no alien resistance.<eos> They'll be there waiting for us.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Well, let's just hope that Mason and his team can figure out how to fire that big-ass alien popgun.<eos> When you get used to the symbology, the Volm language is actually quite intuitive.<eos> It's almost elegant.
And are you guys saying this because you don't want me to be with Jeanette, or because you want me to stay single so you guys can keep your clubhouse?<eos> J'accuse!<eos> I had a point, and they knew it.<eos> You see, in early 2013, I was the only single guy in the group.<eos> Which meant whenever Marshall or Barney bought something they weren't allowed to keep in their apartments...<eos> You know what, Ted?<eos> That reminds me.<eos> I just bought this antique Swiss clock, but Robin won't let us put it in the apartment, so I was gonna leave it at your place.<eos> Only problem?<eos> It's broken.
You know what, Ted?<eos> That reminds me.<eos> I just bought this antique Swiss clock, but Robin won't let us put it in the apartment, so I was gonna leave it at your place.<eos> Only problem?<eos> It's broken.<eos> So I was just gonna sit here and try to fix it while maybe you tell us what you and Jeanette did last night?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, uh, Jeanette is a big Marilyn Monroe fan.<eos> There you go!<eos> Now it's working!
- Maybe we don't.<eos> Maybe we just gotta find that bomb.<eos> Well, thank you, Nora.<eos> I appreciate the loyalty.<eos> Come on, I've been looking all over for you guys.<eos> Miles, you think the bomb is here?<eos> Alec's gonna detonate where the people are.<eos> They're not in the city anymore.<eos> They're here.<eos> It's gonna be here.
Miles, you think the bomb is here?<eos> Alec's gonna detonate where the people are.<eos> They're not in the city anymore.<eos> They're here.<eos> It's gonna be here.<eos> Alec.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> How did the job go?<eos> Smooth.<eos> No, Alec, it didn't.
Pause.<eos> Where's this guy's camera angle?<eos> Uh, doesn't look like we have it.<eos> But all 11 camera feeds are up and running.<eos> Well, punch in on him.<eos> Well, that's why we don't have it.<eos> He's not wearing an action cam.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Check out his mask.<eos> It's a pretty different than the others.
Oh. Of course.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> I had never met her before she called the other night.<eos> Now, why was she calling you?<eos> She was looking to find an original map of the city.<eos> Did she say what for?<eos> Well, she didn't, but she did mention an old orchard that had gone missing.<eos> Missing?<eos> This town was wiped from the earth by one of the river's 100-year floods.<eos> Well, it was rebuilt, but all the original records were lost.
Pick up the phone.<eos> Pick up the phone.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Mr. Cassidy?<eos> It's Ivan Locke from the Park project.<eos> Who?<eos> I'm running the site at Claremount.<eos> We've some road closures agreed.<eos> - How did you get this number?<eos> - You gave it to me. You gave it to me in case anything came up over Christmas.
Gentlemen.<eos> Welcome.<eos> So happy we were able to reach an accord.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Small talk.<eos> Are we going to get on with this?<eos> As you wish.<eos> Straight to business.<eos> The circuit board.<eos> Where is it?
So happy we were able to reach an accord.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Small talk.<eos> Are we going to get on with this?<eos> As you wish.<eos> Straight to business.<eos> The circuit board.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Somewhere safe.<eos> So get us to the boat and then we'll tell you where it is.
No.<eos> History is written... By the victors.<eos> Well, of course, we all know the quote.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> According to Oxford University, it means that my 20 years' loyal service there means nothing next to a little slipup with a co-ed. But what it really means is that history can be seen from aultitude of vantage points.<eos> So, for your first test on Monday...<eos> I'm confused.<eos> When do we get our ice cream?<eos> I want to challenge you to look at history from all perspectives.<eos> How would the story read if it was written not by the victors, but by the vanquished?
Most of them.<eos> But, you know, there was something for everyone.<eos> Rape and torture...<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> Do you have any pictures of, uh, Kayla's body?<eos> Just wondered.<eos> I just want to see what he did to her.<eos> Unfortunately, Tyler's still struggling, but a number of clinical studies have proven that a person experiences the same neurochemical release from the simple act of documenting a fantasy or a violent act.<eos> No offense, Dr. Houston, but isn't this therapy intended to help traumatized victims, not perpetrators?<eos> While writing therapy as applied to offenders may be somewhat controversial, it's proven to be very effective if done properly.
You're not made for hunching.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cailin told me that Paddy gave this to Hope on her 18th birthday.<eos> That would have been 1976.<eos> That's not possible because this scrimshaw commemorates something that was built in 1993.<eos> - The year Paddy disappeared?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And the year that Hope was working as a relief doctor in a war-torn area, Sarajevo.<eos> So, I did some research, and I looked up photos on the internet of this bridge.<eos> And it was near a secret tunnel that was built during the siege of Sarajevo by people trying to get humanitarian aid into the city.
Of course.<eos> Joanna.<eos> You know, it's-it's actually the man who built this place back in the early 1900s.<eos> Archibald Browning.<eos> You heard of him?<eos> Yeah, he was a real son of a bitch.<eos> So I've read. He...<eos> No, I mean, he was into some weird stuff.<eos> That's for sure.<eos> I mean, the architecture of this place, it's, uh, well, it's unique, I'll give it that.
I could check some books if you want.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that-that'd be great.<eos> And, uh, and then... maybe we could, um, discuss it over coffee?<eos> Sure.<eos> Great.<eos> Bye, Ingrid.<eos> How you doing, lady?<eos> Okay, I have an idea.<eos> And it's incredibly stupid, and I can't believe I'm suggesting it, but do you want to try a fertility spell?
Slow down.<eos> What do you mean, they got Polly?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> They took her with them.<eos> That way.<eos> They shot the lock off the back door to get out.<eos> They're gone!<eos> Go. Move.<eos> Go!<eos> Clear it out!
Ow! You have got to be kidding me!<eos> Come on!<eos> I don't want to fight.<eos> Clearly you do, since you keep on taking every street corner drug dealer that you can get your fists on.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> The Glades are worse than ever.<eos> I know, but you already saved a busload of people and managed not to get buried alive.<eos> I mean, how much more of a hero do you need to be?<eos> It's like you have a death wish.<eos> And guess what-- it's going to come true.
They're getting away.<eos> Go!<eos> Move!<eos> Ms. Rochev, I'm sorry about this.<eos> 'Cause they were after you?<eos> Because what happens in this building is my responsibility.<eos> Only for the next 48 hours.<eos> I still can't get used to you in that uniform, Detective Lance.<eos> It's "Officer" now.<eos> And I'm just glad it still fits.
Cross-checking by race and age.<eos> Got one--Jeff Deveau.<eos> Caucasian, late thirties.<eos> What else can you get on him?<eos> Ex-Marine.<eos> Would explain how he can handle himself.<eos> Did he lose his hand overseas?<eos> No.<eos> In the earthquake.<eos> Says here he and his wife were trying to make it across the 52nd Street bridge when it collapsed.
You were right.<eos> I told Mattson you should start working again.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Kicking yet?<eos> - No.<eos> It's only the twelfth week.<eos> It's strong, that desire to have a child.<eos> What a sad story.<eos> But the truth must come out.<eos> Should it? - Yes.
So why doesn't your aunt like you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She just doesn't like me.<eos> For example, one time, when I was ten, and we were at our Hamptons beach house--<eos> I already don't like you.<eos> I wanted my night-night cocoa in my special seagull mug--<eos> Now I hate you.<eos> And my aunt Charity, who was babysitting because everybody else was in Europe at the dressage competition...<eos> Now I've beat you up and left you for dead.<eos> Told me my seagull cup was broken and I knew it wasn't.
- We gotta hurry.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're not out of the woods yet.<eos> We're gonna take this boat to Dunbar 20 miles up.<eos> We got friends there who are gonna help you disappear.<eos> Okay.<eos> Give me the gun, boy.<eos> Give it to me!
So, we'll see you.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - Okay, there, Drew. - Good. Yeah.<eos> You're welcome. - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> [ Knock on door ] Good morning, Christopher.<eos> John Ross, I found some oil leases I think we can get cheap if we act fast.<eos> You mean before Cliff tries to steal them out from under us?<eos> My father making a scene at J.R.'s memorial has nothing to do with me.<eos> I'm still a part of this company, and I want to help it succeed.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system, a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything, violent crimes involving ordinary people.
Yeah, the Lyric drama.<eos> Were you at Beacon Home today?<eos> You left this note?<eos> We want to help. It sounds like you do, too.<eos> What's Pastor Mike lying about?<eos> I had bed at Beacon.<eos> I went out on the roof to smoke.<eos> It was like 4:00 A.M.<eos> And I seen her in the alley -- that girl that got away from that killer, lying there like she was dead.<eos> But she was just out of it, all cut up and bleeding.
He's got perfectly good organs.<eos> Might as well use them.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> He has good organs.<eos> That is genius.<eos> I am a genius.<eos> So you'll have to pick up Zola.<eos> Did you sort out the O.R. board?<eos> I started, but I have a surgery.<eos> I have Torres looking at it right now.
Why do you look confused?<eos> Where is our kidney?<eos> Hands off my kidney!<eos> I'm telling you, this isn't your kidney.<eos> And I'm telling you, show me the paperwork to prove that, or I'm gonna reach down your throat and take one of yours.<eos> I found our kidney.<eos> Great.<eos> Now call off your attack dog.<eos> Wilson, stand down.<eos> - Where is it?
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
He left me no choice. I had to kill him.<eos> Then I realized my only way off this island was to become him.<eos> Then this damn storm hits, and some cowboy US Marshal comes knocking.<eos> I was stuck as Special Agent Fahey, so I improvised.<eos> And the deputy.<eos> Why harm her?<eos> Well, I couldn't be sure what she heard off the radio.<eos> You always have to be ready to improvise.<eos> Honestly, the question isn't who I am.<eos> It's who you are.
I don't know what happens.<eos> But I'm glad you were here.<eos> A drug smuggler shot at me with a spear gun last night.<eos> Is that a first for you?<eos> Wish I could say yes.<eos> Glad you made it back, Mr. Reese.<eos> I am too.<eos> And I'm glad the machine was right.<eos> How so?<eos> It was smart enough to tell us about a killer with multiple identities.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Where's O.B.?<eos> - What's happening?<eos> Kepner, she's bleeding.<eos> What?<eos> Cord's prolapsed.<eos> We need to secure it.<eos> What is happening?<eos> Your baby's umbilical cord has dropped, and it's now trapped against her body, and that's why she's in distress.
I'm pretty sure her husband killed her.<eos> ...but because I'm worried about her.<eos> I want to tell that it's okay, that I want her to be happy.<eos> Even if being happy means... being with somebody else.<eos> That was recorded by the police the first time they interviewed Drew Gardner five months ago.<eos> He said the same exact thing to me this morning.<eos> Verbatim.<eos> And because he repeated himself, you think he's a murderer.<eos> No, it's not because he repeated himself, it's just that what he said sounded rehearsed-- like... like he came up with his story and then stuck with it.<eos> Perhaps it's lodged in his brain because he's had to repeat it so often.
Charlie, I want to introduce you to my fantastic assistant Steve.<eos> - Steve, how are you?<eos> Good. - How do you do, sir? Now, without this guy around here, the whole operation would fall apart.<eos> Yo, Steve, would you get us some coffee, please?<eos> - Right away.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Well, it looks like you and Steve have worked things out.<eos> No, you gotta fire him.<eos> You just said the whole thing would fall apart without him.<eos> What I didn't say is it'll fall apart faster with him.
Charlie's got something to tell you.<eos> So, Steve. Guess who doesn't have to work late tonight.<eos> - You're a great photographer, Nolan.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I think this one's really good. Yeah, maybe.<eos> I mean, after we get it into Photoshop and fix your face.<eos> Which part?<eos> - You know, your...<eos> - My nose.<eos> It's crooked, isn't it?

Freshly opened can of whup-ass.<eos> Ed, it sounds to me like you have a man cave.<eos> What the hell is a man cave?<eos> It's a place where you keep all your favorite stuff.<eos> You can do whatever you want and nobody bothers you.<eos> Used to be called your life, but then you got married.<eos> So now it's just a room.<eos> Well, the problem is my wife is in there more than I am.<eos> She said I needed a plant in there, so now she's in there all the time taking care of the plant.<eos> You know, feeding it, watering it, talking to it.
No, no, no, no, not at all. Ms. Davenport was just about to embark on some damage control for my campaign.<eos> Now what can I do for you?<eos> Well, I've... I've given some thought to your offer.<eos> Ah.<eos> And I accept.<eos> And I'm delighted. After yesterday's fiasco, there's no one I'd rather have beside me on the campaign trail.<eos> Welcome aboard.<eos> Any luck?<eos> Getting closer. The text was spoofed.<eos> It came from a computer, not a phone, then was bounced around through several S.M.S. servers.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system, a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything, violent crimes involving ordinary people.
You got to let me help you get your strength back.<eos> This isn't a cold or a fever or whatever it is you're supposed to feed.<eos> This is part of it all.<eos> Those first two trials -- they're not just things I did.<eos> T-they're doing something to me.<eos> They're changing me, Dean.<eos> It's Kevin.<eos> Finally.<eos> Sam, Dean,<eos> I've set up this message with some software and a remote server so it'd send itself to you if I didn't reset it with a command once a week, which means I didn't reset it this week.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> We've arranged for Weinberger and Baker to have an actual meeting in the Weinberger study tomorrow.<eos> We also made sure the KGB heard about it, along with the word "Spetsnaz," which is all it takes to drive them crazy.<eos> Given how important this bug must be to them, they would never risk exposing it by sending a Rezidentura officer to pick up a recording.
If you didn't what, Drew? What? Keep driving for him?<eos> What?<eos> Blow the Ewing rig.<eos> I knew it was only gonna be a matter of time before I'd tell you. And once the Ewings connected Ryland to the explosion, well, blame has a way of trickling down.<eos> You built a bomb?<eos> For Ryland?<eos> He promised me there wouldn't be anyone on the rig, that planting the bomb would just cause some embarrassment of the Ewings a... and give his boss an edge on a business deal.<eos> No, Drew. I swear, I...<eos> I've gone over and over it in my mind.<eos> They tried to blame me, but they set it off. - I know it.
I just want to get a look at his hyoid bone to see if it was crushed like Sofia's.<eos> I mean, what about an X-ray or an MRI?<eos> That won't show you enough.<eos> Fine. What about that fluoroscope thing?<eos> It might work.<eos> We can at least see the tissue below the surface.<eos> Okay, that. That's bruising, right?<eos> There's a distinctive subdural hematoma, yes.<eos> The shape of that bruise doesn't look like it would be caused by an elbow strike.<eos> It's more consistent with the shape of a... A closed fist.
He was a good-hearted man, devoted to his family and his craft.<eos> The candle maker brought light to the entire village. But he longed to give them more.<eos> Life was hard in Gladbury, and the people had become disheartened.<eos> [NARRATOR] Night and day, the candle maker worked, pouring his heart and his prayers into each candle.<eos> But on the first Sunday of Advent, all he had left to give...<eos> was a single prayer, not for himself, but for Gladbury, for his son, and for all the sons and daughters to come.<eos> Silence was the only answer he would receive that night.<eos> Or so it seemed.<eos> [NARRATOR] An angel blessed a single candle.<eos> The heavenly gift was given to the ones who needed it most, with the simple instruction:
[EDWARD] Why Bethlehem?<eos> Why a babe in a manger?<eos> Who could possibly hope to understand the ways of the Lord'!<eos> But I see no reason to promote superstitions or raise false hopes.<eos> [LADY CAMDON] People of Gladbury lead difficult lives.<eos> Even the slightest hope of a miracle keeps their faith alive.<eos> Only to be crushed when their prayers go unanswered.<eos> If this is what your people need, then I--<eos> [LADY CAMDON] What our people need is hope.<eos> And you can give it to them.
I will chop the wood.<eos> No m'lady, I won't have it.<eos> Pray for him, Reverend.<eos> [DAVID] Certainly.<eos> Our Father in Heaven, please grant your servant Herbert with the good sense to follow the doctor's orders and get some rest.<eos> [DAVID] I've had enough of Herbert hauling crates of candles.<eos> Besides, it's high time that Gladbury see the light.<eos> [EMILY] Electricity...<eos> In the church.<eos> For too long the church has stumbled about in the dark ages, when it should be lighting the way.
But that's a standing order.<eos> It has been for two hundred years.<eos> It's standing no more, I'm afraid.<eos> But I just delivered three crates.<eos> Yes,thank you, but we only need one.<eos> But... but--<eos> [DAVID] Trust me when I say, it's for the good of Gladbury.<eos> [BEA] What does he know about the good of Gladbury?<eos> This is our legacy, and he's meddling with it.<eos> I say we light the candle right now. We've earned it.
[MR. FINCH] I've been out of a job for some time now, and found myself in debt up to my ears.<eos> But then, our landlady--<eos> [MRS. FINCH] She forgave us our debts in full.<eos> [MR. FINCH] And if that wasn't enough, well I found work at the Leonard house.<eos> It makes a man feel good to provide for his family again.<eos> And my wife, she's found a good friend in Ms. Leonard.<eos> [MRS. FINCH] Yes, this dear woman, she's taught our kids to knit.<eos> [JOE] [on verge of tears] My name's Joe.<eos> I'm not really a religious man.<eos> I asked for the candle, and it's saved my cat.
The land will be yours.<eos> You can live there in peace with Clea.<eos> Ulysses came to welcome us.<eos> He had a thick gray beard, powerful muscles,<eos> a lot of presence.<eos> I see why you love him, my queen.<eos> The scar...<eos> tell me about the scar.<eos> I want to be sure it's him.<eos> It starts here and goes up the thigh.
You wanted to make me a coward.<eos> I did it all for you. Everything I do is to protect you.<eos> You're the most important one to me.<eos> You have to marry Leocritus.<eos> They'll burn what's left of Ulysses.<eos> It's your fault.<eos> No. That slave ruined everything.<eos> It's her fault.<eos> She must die.<eos> - It's Eurynome's daughter. - I don't care.
I'm on your side. Don't be afraid.<eos> Of men or gods.<eos> Oh, Artemis, watch over queen Penelope and our island of Ithaca.<eos> Bring it the prosperity and stability it once had.<eos> You aren't praying for Ulysses?<eos> I've prayed every day for 10 years.<eos> If he hasn't returned, the goddess can't hear me.<eos> Maybe she'll hear today.<eos> Try again.<eos> Faith pleases the gods, but it's starting to irritate the people.
Will you love me as Ulysses loved Penelope?<eos> I'm not worthy of such love.<eos> Thank you for hosting us.<eos> Our ship is waiting.<eos> Thank you, Alcinoos.<eos> I need to speak to her.<eos> Nausicaa?<eos> Help Telemachus, Nausicaa.<eos> A king's task is heavy.<eos> It isolates him.
Thank you.<eos> May the gods be with you.<eos> May they not abandon us.<eos> The Pheacians leave, but their army may return.<eos> Behind you!<eos> Menelaus's guard dog.<eos> What were you plotting?<eos> Why come to my island?<eos> Your island?<eos> Enjoy it while it's still yours.
Transporters.<eos> No way, sir!<eos> Power levels at 9 %!<eos> Impact in 5 seconds.<eos> Jim!<eos> We're out of options! But you don't know if... Impact!<eos> Report.<eos> Power levels at 12 % 19 % Increasing steadily. All decks reporting in.<eos> Our torpedo broke off small pieces of the anomaly.<eos> The bulk is still intact, but it is no longer a viable threat.
- Good morning.<eos> You look very jovial.<eos> Just Baxter, reminding me of times gone by.<eos> You're pleased with her?<eos> I am, thank heaven.<eos> So, what's your day looking like?<eos> Tom and Mary have summoned me to the library.<eos> They have an idea.<eos> I hope it's not something you're going to fight about.<eos> Erm, how can I answer that when I don't know what it is?
This is it.<eos> My name is Arsene Avignon.<eos> I am the sous chef of The Ritz.<eos> Today, you are going to make four dishes.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Then if you have no questions, we will begin.<eos> In 1917, at our sister hotel in New York the Chef Monsieur Diat altered a soup made popular by Monsieur Gouffe and the great Monsieur Escoffier.<eos> What did he do?<eos> He served it cold.<eos> Very good. Yes, it was eaten cold.

Yes, it was eaten cold.<eos> Previously, the name had been a simple one, Leek and Potato Soup.<eos> But what was it called now?
That is not at all what I asked.<eos> I'm very grateful, m'lady.<eos> I know you didn't have to do this, but it only makes me more determined to prove I'm worthy of your faith.<eos> I can't pretend to take the credit, Mr Drewe.<eos> It was his lordship who was determined you should stay.<eos> You owe your thanks to him.<eos> He'll have my thanks, m'lady. And he'll have the rest of the payment before he's missed it.<eos> - What payment?<eos> - The remainder of the debt.<eos> I thought you'd know about it.
Mr and Mrs Bates?<eos> That doesn't sound very likely.<eos> Can I ask you to put that machine away?<eos> We'll be laying for tea in a minute.<eos> Is everything ready for the servants' tea?<eos> Oh, is it just me or do we have twice the bills we used to?<eos> Ivy, this is for you.<eos> Did you find those oyster shells for the kettle?<eos> I've put them in.<eos> About time. It were full of scale.
That's a relief.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I don't mean anything.<eos> Mary!<eos> Did your mother warn you I was coming?<eos> She did.<eos> Why are you back in Yorkshire so soon?<eos> I'd no sooner got back than I was despatched to a tenant farmers' convention in Whitby.<eos> But it's over now, so I'll go home from here.
Welcome back to KZHC, where we play the smooth sounds of the '80s and the '90s.<eos> I'm Patrick Jane from the California Bureau of Investigation.<eos> Yes, that is something that does exist.<eos> And we're throwing a contest today because we need your help to find a car, a very important car that will help us break a very important case.<eos> We're looking for a silver Mercedes S-class, license plate "KIPMAN7"-- we're looking for a silver Mercedes S K-I-P-M-A-N-7.<eos> The first person to call in the location of this car will receive $10,000 cash money.<eos> Yes, folks, we're talking ca-- whoop.<eos> Wait.<eos> I just got word from my producer that that is not the amount of the prize.<eos> It is actually... $20...
I get that. But you're gonna go in there.<eos> You're gonna tell her, "Hey, babe, I don't want to go on this show."<eos> I mean, who in their right mind wants to air their dirty laundry on the radio for other people's entertainment?<eos> It is a terrible idea.<eos> And she will respect you for making a stand.<eos> You really think so?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Women love a strong man.<eos> Besides, have you listened to the show?<eos> It's crap.

You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything... violent crimes involving ordinary people.
Then we can tell the old man together, okay?<eos> And, Monica... thank you.<eos> I need to see the emails on that drive.<eos> I'll have to contrive a reason to get into his office.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Nice to have you back.<eos> Thanks for meeting me, Mr. Quinn.<eos> How's the shoulder?<eos> It's getting stronger day by day.
What's your interest?<eos> You think I need a hobby, Harold?<eos> I think I just found one.<eos> Traitor.<eos> Lee was a spy... for China?<eos> Looks that way.<eos> Any idea why China might be interested in Rylatech?<eos> Our proprietary designs keep us at the forefront of the industry.<eos> Maybe they want to steal our work.<eos> Or sabotage it.
- So what now?<eos> - If I can't get through the firewall?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> What about bypassing it all together and directly accessing the servers?<eos> That would require going back inside Rylatech.<eos> - I could show you where to go.<eos> - It's too risky.<eos> Everyone in that building knows your face.<eos> Ms. Jacobs, do you still have your employee ID card?<eos> Yes, but it's been deactivated.
If you want to say good-bye, now would be the time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good-bye, Grandpa.<eos> We tried.<eos> Jason.<eos> By the time you get to the car, this awful burden will be lifted from you.<eos> Go.<eos> That's her. It's fresh, too.<eos> Can't be more than a few hours.<eos> Trail goes north from here, Packmaster, but it's fainter.
I keep forgetting this is new to you.<eos> The steep learning curve of the couples' therapist.<eos> You aren't used to the process you have to go through.<eos> Which is?<eos> Change.<eos> That's what all women want.<eos> As soon as she gets the man she wants, she starts changing him.<eos> Any relationship between man and woman consists of the man resisting and the woman constantly shaping who he is.<eos> And so it will go on. Until your personality has been ground to sawdust.<eos> Until it drifts out so sea with all the other emotional driftwood bobbing around out there.
What are you doing?<eos> Ignore Sarita.<eos> She's frigid.<eos> - So?<eos> What do you say?<eos> - Well, uh...<eos> Where did you get that necklace?<eos> It was a gift.<eos> Why?<eos> You like it?
It was nice to meet you.<eos> Eric, Nancy,<eos> I want to make sure that you guys are up for this.<eos> Edward Rasmus isn't known for playing with kid gloves, so this could get rough.<eos> We invested our entire life savings with Rasmus and he stole it.<eos> Our retirement.<eos> Taylor's college fund.<eos> He stole our future, Ms. Lance.<eos> We want it back.<eos> Well, then let's go get it.
I told--I told him to take everything.<eos> My money... my ring.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> They shot me.<eos> I screamed for help, but no one would come.<eos> No one would come.<eos> Malcolm, I don't want to die alone.<eos> She bled out into the pavement while people passed, did nothing.<eos> Your mother built her clinic in the Glades because she wanted to save this city.<eos> It can't be saved.
You were right.<eos> I need one more thing from you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What do I got left to give?<eos> I know where Merlyn is keeping the device.<eos> It's in an abandoned subway station near Puckett Street.<eos> How do you know?<eos> That's where his wife was murdered.<eos> We have a mutual friend that I think could... Talk you through it.<eos> She says you care about the people of this city, that it needs you.
I killed a women.<eos> Lilija.<eos> She was a jew.<eos> She helped me, and I betrayed her.<eos> Nothing is like we imagined, Greta.<eos> I hoped Viktor would write me.<eos> I have no Idea how he is. And where he is.<eos> This wound won't heal by itself.<eos> That's dangerous.<eos> It needs to be stitched.
Not only is he a vegetarian, he works hard, too.<eos> That's true.<eos> Why I appreciate above all is his loyalty and strictness.<eos> Julia, will you bring the dessert?<eos> Hurry up, we're going to be late.<eos> My God, my hair looks awful.<eos> I don't like it this flat.<eos> I would like to have a shorter, sculpted cut. What do you think?<eos> Where's your grosgrain coat?<eos> It's not warm enough.
Open that coat a little bit.<eos> Make yourself more chic.<eos> I don't care about gallant remarks.<eos> That's pretty obvious.<eos> Philippe Lardut won't give you any kind of romance.<eos> Well, I like him.<eos> He's close to his village roots. The land doesn't lie.<eos> And I want a grounded husband, not a dreamer.<eos> I simply don't understand your crush on that simpleton.<eos> Believe me, romance in a couple may seem trite, but it makes a wife's life beautiful.
After the election it all went down!<eos> I didn't think they would start a strike.<eos> The Reds dare to everything!<eos> Ask for L'Humanité!<eos> The Communist Party will make a happier France!<eos> Thanks, comrade.<eos> L'Humanite!<eos> The German chancellor threatens the Spanish republic!<eos> Isn't the music too loud?<eos> On the contrary, it helps me.
Mm.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> That's good.<eos> But no deeper.<eos> Yeah, that's better.<eos> Okay, so you want to place the screws medial to the tibial crest so you don't interfere with intravascular bundle.<eos> Medial to the tibial crest.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Now advance the screw by hand. Yeah.<eos> Until it's anchored in the far cortex.
The world would be a more interesting place with a few new Turners in it.<eos> So these are all your... work, are they?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You're very gifted.<eos> Do you do original work?<eos> What could I add to all this?<eos> What could anyone?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to linger, I just...<eos> It's just... if these were all supposed to be reproductions, what is the original of Brueghel's The Blind Leading the Blind doing on your wall?<eos> I wonder what the director of the Belgian National Museum would have to say if he knew that you had returned your work to him and passed it off as the real thing.
We are on to something here.<eos> We can find Isaac Proctor and that might lead us to Moriarty.<eos> I'm sorry, Watson.<eos> My mind is made up.<eos> This is what Moriarty wants, and if it's what he wants, it's a mistake.<eos> Were you followed?<eos> No.<eos> The plates are clean.<eos> There's $30,000 and a phone in the glove compartment. You drive to Calgary, and you wait.<eos> The next instructions you're gonna get are on the burner, so... stay close to it.
We will use crows' blood instead of chicken blood, which will work with the amulet on his chest, collecting the essence of his "yin" spirit.<eos> Clouds of the spirits... open... against the gods' will...<eos> Remember, never take the mask off.<eos> How much longer until Tung comes back?<eos> In seven days, Tung's spirit will come back.<eos> It may be the perfect time then.<eos> May be?<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> If it doesn't work, there's another way. What is it?<eos> It's very extreme.
And I wrote... I did what you asked me to do, Jessica.<eos> - I wrote the, uh, gigleography.<eos> - The what?<eos> - The gigleography.<eos> - A "gigleography"?<eos> Urology.<eos> - Elegy?<eos> - Eulogish.<eos> You wrote the eulogy.<eos> That's what I've been saying the whole time-- it's right here.
Ted, open the...<eos> Uh... walls closing in.<eos> I can't... can't breathe.<eos> Must... show deal... on Jor-El cam...<eos> I can't...<eos> Oh, well, guess I'm keeping this place forever, good night.<eos> Wait a... wait a minute, that's it?<eos> Ted wasn't interested in buying your apartment, so you just gave up?<eos> Barney, I gave up my beautiful two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side that was rent-free and the landlord hand-washed all my delicates.<eos> Which is probably why it was rent-free.
She works at her dad's garage.<eos> She's practically a guy.<eos> JoJo? !<eos> Hi, Peter.<eos> But I thought you was workin' on your garbage sculpture.<eos> There was someone I had to see first.<eos> Sorry, Amanda.<eos> By the law of '80s movies, a newly transformed tomboy supersedes your long-standing hotness.<eos> Let's face it- there's only one drinking spot for us, and it's the Clam.<eos> But, Peter, it's closed.
All right!<eos> Yeah!<eos> We love Joe!<eos> Swanson, what the hell's going on in here?<eos> I'm sorry, Chief. I just can't let them bulldoze this building.<eos> Hey, Joe, is this the same chief whose wife is a real hog?<eos> Swanson, don't be a fool.<eos> You really want to throw away your career on this?<eos> Guys, your bar is gone.<eos> And since it's bank property, I have no choice but to place you all under arrest.

You know, me and you can take this all the way to the top.<eos> What's it take to crease that mug?<eos> I gave you a good haul last time, didn't I?<eos> Tell me what this says.<eos> What, the great Sherlock Holmes couldn't crack it?<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> If you could speed things up for me, then I won't have to.<eos> Go to the incoming text log.<eos> Now back to the message.<eos> What does it say?
Go to the incoming text log.<eos> Now back to the message.<eos> What does it say?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's not the code we used to use.<eos> Bollocks.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Nope.<eos> Someone's winding you up, mate.<eos> Tell me what it says, Moran.
What're you doing here?<eos> I'd like you to take a look at something.<eos> Then I'd like you to join me in the conference room.<eos> You want to tell me why you asked me to look at what appears to be the brutal rape of a teenage girl?<eos> I thought it was important you understand what was at stake.<eos> The man in that video is Brent Garvey.<eos> He was arrested in New Jersey several years ago and convicted of sexually assaulting three young women:<eos> Eva Whitman, Tracy Bender,<eos> Karen Pistone.<eos> Eva Whitman's father received that DVD in the mail, along with a note which demanded that he pay $10,000 or see it released on the Internet.
You know that 500 bucks we lost?<eos> I sort of took that from Lois without asking.<eos> If she finds out it's all gone, she'Il kill me.<eos> Did you fellas say you were in a bit of a fix?<eos> My buddy's got the inside track on a basketball game.<eos> It's a sure thing.<eos> I like how all your teeth are different shapes.<eos> Why are you telling us this?<eos> What do you want from us?<eos> Honestly, I'm trying to sell my condo, and I need people to come to the open house and talk about how nice it is.
Just don't say anything, okay?<eos> Oh, you know what, hang on, I left my harmonica in the tub.<eos> I think Peter's in there taking a bath.<eos> Aah!<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> What the hell did I just sit on?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Where's my harmonica?<eos> Peter, have you seen Stewie's harmonica?<eos> It was in the tub.

I'm not, but I am starting to think that you're hiding something.<eos> I'm starting to think the same thing.<eos> An ADA going on a ride-along?<eos> That's uniform cop stuff.<eos> Why are you so focused on Vargas?<eos> What's your agenda?<eos> I have a personal investment in this particular case.<eos> - Care to elaborate? - No.<eos> That's even vaguer than my answers at the press conference.<eos> Thing is, my situation with Tess-- it's personal, too, and it certainly doesn't require the attention of an ADA.
It's gone, it's back!<eos> Come here.<eos> Where are we?<eos> - Hang on, where are we...<eos> The village, the church...<eos> Right, that's the cottage just there and there's the church.<eos> Look on the map.<eos> You know the sign for a church, don't you?<eos> It's a little round thing with a cross, see if you can find it.<eos> It's in this area here.
You gonna wear that thing to bed?<eos> No, I'll stick it on charge in a minute.<eos> You alright, Deacon?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You?<eos> Yeah, I'm alright...<eos> What are you reading?<eos> - What's this?<eos> It's a journal from Dr. Pritchard Mandeville.<eos> Now he was the last minister of the church before it closed around 1880.
That soil may yet lead us to her.<eos> Forgive us, Councillor, we are somewhat pressed.<eos> I merely wish to let you know that the woman Raine, I've a clue as to where she might call home.<eos> I was not the first advocate she sought out.<eos> She spoke bitterly of her home parish where she might have expected succour but received none. St John at Hackney, Inspector.<eos> Bow matchworks and surrounds.<eos> St John at Hackney.<eos> Thanks to Miss Cobden, our search narrows.<eos> There are women located in this section. The soil burned hard and fast.<eos> That means there's heavy residue of organic matter within it - peat. Fossilised microscopic remains throughout.
I told you there was a vibe, didn't I?<eos> Why were you cock-blocking me?<eos> Mm, because it's funny.<eos> Here he is, looking good,<eos> - ready for the big night.<eos> - Guess what?<eos> What?<eos> My sister saw Marion having coffee with some guy.<eos> It's just... could we just have one night where we don't talk about your failed marriage?<eos> It's not a failed marriage.
I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies.<eos> Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.<eos> We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.<eos> My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.
If we're going to change the topic from jellyfish, I'd be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.<eos> Show a little compassion-- a man died.<eos> And turned into a puddle of goo.<eos> Now, we can either sit around and cry over spilt professor, or... we can rejoice in the knowledge that a tenured position has just opened up.<eos> I choose to do the latter.<eos> Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous.<eos> A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent.<eos> If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.<eos> Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.<eos> If you need my nose, you'll find it firmly lodged up the rectum of the tenure committee.

He has a symbol for where someone was taken, and then a different mark for where the bodies are found, see?<eos> Now here's the scary part.<eos> There have been six sacrifices, right?<eos> There are 12 markings on the map.<eos> What?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Did your dad find other bodies and not tell anyone?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I think he knows where the body is going to be found, so one of these six locations, one of these, is where Deaton could end up.<eos> I mean, it doesn't tell us where he's being kept right now, but... but it's close to figuring it out.
I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> The full moon.<eos> That feeling... That was worth it.<eos> There's a lunar eclipse.<eos> I always wondered what... What that felt like for one of us.<eos> For one of us...<eos> Boyd, what do you think will happen to us on the lunar eclipse?<eos> They last for hours, you know, because it's just the earth's shadow.<eos> I wonder what will happen to us.<eos> Maybe it'll make us stronger.

Look, you two may be crazy in love, but your love is driving us crazy.<eos> Crazy in love?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> We're not in love.<eos> Oleg and I are just shtup buddies.<eos> Shtup buddies?<eos> I wouldn't say that's all we are.<eos> Oh, no, you're right.<eos> We also share a CVS points reward card.<eos> Is it really a reward if it comes from CVS?
You're not a chair, you're our best friend.<eos> You can say that, but a lot can change in a year.<eos> Buddy, I...<eos> Look, I know I'm being crazy.<eos> I just...<eos> I just need a moment with this chair.<eos> You know... to say good-bye.<eos> We'll give you two some space.<eos> Kids, you can't cling to the past.<eos> Because no matter how tightly you hold on it's already gone.
This hotel is falling apart.<eos> I can't manage on my own.<eos> I know all about staff problems.<eos> My parents had a café near Joinville. The mussels-and-chips type.<eos> Joinville?<eos> I thought you were a Northerner.<eos> I was originally.<eos> And then we moved south.<eos> Tell me about the café.<eos> It was next to the old film studios.
Shit!<eos> He's spent his life destroying people.<eos> All I've done is break his fucking spine!<eos> Don't move!<eos> He can cope just fine.<eos> Besides, he's a lucky sod.<eos> Let him die!<eos> Ludo, give me your gun.<eos> You've done enough damage.<eos> Leave it to me.
Frontload Tech just moved its RD offices right nearby.<eos> Yeah, but there would be a ton of firewalls to protect proprietary information.<eos> Yeah, but look at all these houses sold.<eos> Frost, who lives around Leroy?<eos> Frontload Tech engineers.<eos> A lot of them.<eos> That's it.<eos> You take your phone and your computer home.<eos> If I wanted to steal, I would send a drone, fly it over your home.<eos> It was doing a war-drive, piggybacking on wi-fi networks and downloading everything.
Clear.<eos> LEROY:<eos> Put it down, please!<eos> LEROY:<eos> I don't know what you want.<eos> - JIM:<eos> Where's the hard drive you stole?<eos> - LEROY: Stop it.<eos> - JIM:<eos> Tell me where it is!
- JIM:<eos> Tell me where it is!<eos> - LEROY: Leave me alone!<eos> You're the reason your friend is dead.<eos> - And you shouldn't have shot down my drone and taken it apart.<eos> Now, where is it?<eos> Where's the hard drive you stole?<eos> - Police have it.<eos> - You're a liar!<eos> You tell me where it is or you're a dead man.
You found something?<eos> Lestrade was right.<eos> Lawrence Pendry did kill his wife.<eos> I know exactly how he did it.<eos> 13 months ago, a neighbor heard the shot which took Mary Pendry's life at exactly 6:33.<eos> Yes, I know this.<eos> I know all of this.<eos> I just want to know what you found in that bastard's house.<eos> The primary reason you were never able to build a case against Pendry was that you could not find the murder weapon.<eos> I humbly submit that it was in the kitchen the entire time.
As I mentioned, Sherlock's never had any friends. Many colleagues, never a friend... until you.<eos> I want to know how you did it.<eos> I want to know... how does one become Sherlock Holmes' friend?<eos> Look, I owe you an apology... for not protecting you when we worked together.<eos> Protecting me from what?<eos> From the spotlight, the attention.<eos> Those were some of the best days of my career.<eos> You know, my name was in the paper, my face was on the telly.<eos> The whole thing, it was, it was...<eos> It was intoxicating, hm?

That you and this whole town want so badly to believe.<eos> - There is actual evidence.<eos> - What?<eos> One text from a drunk girl claiming to know about something that happened five years ago?<eos> So Danny told you.<eos> I know he's an easy target, but please... don't ruin his life now just because you're still holding a grudge.<eos> I don't hold grudges, Karen.<eos> That's your department.<eos> While you're here, this necklace look familiar?<eos> No, it doesn't.

I knew you'd decide to come, babe.<eos> Thanks for supporting me.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> I am honored to introduce a special guest.<eos> She graduated magna cum laude from Green Grove Junior College and she is a certified grief specialist.<eos> Welcome, April Tanaka.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wow.<eos> Grief.<eos> To most people who've never experienced it before, it's just a five letter word.
My dad wasn't really happy about it.<eos> Try not to kill me, okay.<eos> It'll make me look really bad in front of my parents.<eos> I'll keep that in mind.<eos> Is this the same...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I guess it is.<eos> Your mom really does hate change.<eos> Oh, I visited our fort today.<eos> It's in pretty good shape, you know, after five years of neglect.
He has neither the means nor the guts to implement the promises he made to the Jews.<eos> But the Church can't perjure itself.<eos> What's been said is said.<eos> The nuns must go.<eos> Poland won't accept that.<eos> - There will be an uproar.<eos> - On the Jewish side as well, from all around the world, if the nuns don't leave Auschwitz.<eos> Klein has already told the media about the Pregny agreement.<eos> You promised me it would all remain a secret.<eos> So long as an agreement hadn't been reached, but it has, Karol.
Juliette, really, I am not making this up.<eos> Really, I am not making this up.<eos> Detective Griffin. Hank?<eos> It's Rosalee and Monroe.<eos> - Is Nick with you?<eos> - No.<eos> I was hoping he was with you.<eos> No, he's not at the precinct.<eos> Hank, listen, we found out more about the Musai.<eos> There's no way we can break the connection between her and Nick if it's already been established, at least not with anything I can do. And Nick is in the wind.
Yeah, will do.<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just get the feeling this guy is playing us.<eos> I mean, the recorded phone call, the stuff in the trunk.<eos> I saw him at the hospital and the first crime scene?<eos> And why kidnap a tow truck driver and dump his car here?<eos> I don't know, maybe I'm just over-thinking it.<eos> No, no, no, maybe not.<eos> This thing is getting out of hand, and it's not making a lot of sense.
Still could've called 911.<eos> Serology report is back.<eos> The blood on his shirt is a match to his girlfriend.<eos> What about drugs?<eos> He had scopolamine in his system.<eos> The zombie drug.<eos> Zombie drug?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Yeah, we came across this when I was in vice.<eos> It comes from Venezuela.
This past month they've been raiding the coastal towns along the province.<eos> They've not done that before.<eos> If trade suffers, we all suffer.<eos> Rome as well.<eos> So Venice's suffering is Rome's suffering.<eos> Exactly so, Holiness.<eos> Except with rather more mosquitoes.<eos> Well, we thank you for bringing our suffering to our attention.<eos> We were not aware.<eos> We will give this matter the consideration that it merits.
I'm sorry.<eos> I cannot.<eos> I -<eos> We're married now. We're married.<eos> Last night... something more happened than just a question mark on a place setting.<eos> What happened?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What else happened?<eos> A cloud descended on me - my heart.<eos> Let me lift it then.
You can't... unless you can ensure a loyalty of an entire Consistory.<eos> If that will bring me your forgiveness, and you some peace of mind, then I shall find a way.<eos> It does require your attention.<eos> You wished to speak to us?<eos> In private?<eos> It's a matter of delicacy, Holiness, but a matter that can no longer go unattended.<eos> Then speak.<eos> The marriage of your daughter to our cousin.<eos> It has come to my attention that it is a marriage in name only. Hm?<eos> It is unfulfilled.
What?<eos> It's only been a few days. Still.<eos> A few days become a few weeks and then come the lovers.<eos> Do not speak of our daughter thus.<eos> You are a guest here!<eos> "Thou shalt enter unto her - "<eos> Do not preach to us about what God tells us.<eos> "...and thou shalt know her, and she shall be to thee for a woman."<eos> Now, unless this is done, this marriage is a sham.<eos> If it is unconsummated, then whose fault is that? How am I to tell?
It is an insult to Lucrezia! It is an insult to us!<eos> Oh, quieten yourself.<eos> On how many fronts would you have us fight?<eos> And besides, there is a precedent.<eos> I will see him burn for this.<eos> There is a precedent!<eos> It may stick in your gullet as it sticks in mine, but when all is said and done, he is in the right.<eos> Do you honestly think it matters one jot to me?<eos> Well it should! It must!<eos> Would you have this alliance soured with Naples the moment it is struck?
I would not have His Holiness's judgment in the matter tainted one jot with Catherina Sforza's poisoned words.<eos> Burn it.<eos> Your Eminence.<eos> Burn it.<eos> Burn it!<eos> As you wish.<eos> Oh, wait!<eos> Wait.<eos> We should at least preserve the box.<eos> It is exquisite.
Why?<eos> Why?<eos> That's why.<eos> Soldiers approaching!<eos> The king of France, my lord.<eos> Your Highness.<eos> So Ludovico is alive.<eos> His army is intact.<eos> His army is no longer what I call an army.<eos> It's scattered.
You have a treasure here.<eos> Just the scrapings of the earth.<eos> From where?<eos> We collect gravel.<eos> Shale.<eos> Sell it where we can.<eos> Hebrews.<eos> You would sell the very soil if you could.<eos> Does soil have any value?<eos> Does it burn?
It's a miracle I didn't pass it down to Mitchell.<eos> I love that we can blame our parents.<eos> My mother was the biggest cheater I've ever known.<eos> And she used to snoop on everything that we did.<eos> Ay. Jay, look at this.<eos> Our invitation.<eos> They must have forgot to give it to us.<eos> No.<eos> I checked this bag when we got here,<eos> - and it wasn't there.
And that's how Kim Kardashian became famous.<eos> It's bad enough I'm taking a picture of my vagina,<eos> I'm doing it with an iPhone 3.<eos> Too dark.<eos> Needs a flash.<eos> All right, but watch out for red-eye.<eos> Ohh... There she is.<eos> Yeah, that's definitely something.<eos> - Let me see it.<eos> - Wait, it needs a filter.
- We're getting that world back.<eos> - Huh. How?<eos> We try again.<eos> Try again.<eos> But, sire, the device is too dangerous.<eos> Our attack on New Themyscira destroyed an entire continent, but still left the Amazon's new homeland untouched.<eos> More unholy magic from those witches.<eos> Next time we will level their island.<eos> Please, my Emperor.<eos> We tried to use only a fraction of the power, and now it is even less stable.
Chester's Mill is a place like any other.<eos> At least, it used to be, until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome.<eos> Invisible, indestructible, inescapable.<eos> We're trapped.<eos> We don't know where it came from or why it's here, but now that we're all trapped under the dome together, none of our secrets are safe.
We all screw up.<eos> We make bad choices.<eos> Tell that to my father.<eos> You want to know how I ended up in Chester's Mill?<eos> I was covering the mayor's race in Chicago.<eos> The guy in the lead was a real machine politician.<eos> I really wanted to take him down.<eos> About a week before the election, one of my sources sent me some documents that showed bribery.<eos> I thought the leaked docs might be forged, but I went ahead with the story anyway.<eos> And it blew up in my face.
And we all support the team.<eos> What was that about?<eos> Long story.<eos> What kind of trouble you been getting into?<eos> No trouble.<eos> I went down into the cement works and tried to find a way out.<eos> Failed, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The dome cuts straight through.<eos> Well, of course it does.
I thought I was having a heart attack.<eos> Well, with the draft coming up and all this money at stake, that's a lot for an 18-year-old.<eos> If baseball pays me a lot of dough, that's awesome, but I'm in it because I love the game.<eos> The mound is the -- it's the one place I feel happy.<eos> Are you happy here, at the Academy, away from home?<eos> You kidding?<eos> It's the greatest thing that happened to me.<eos> I've spent four years at V3. Connor and Troy have given me everything I need to reach the dream, and now I'm gonna blow it over something this stupid.<eos> Hey, Hutch, fear of flying is not an uncommon phobia.<eos> And luckily, it's one of the easiest to tackle...
All right, we got a kid who won't fly, and now he can't pitch.<eos> He's got to be on -- and off -- that plane in Kansas City in five days.<eos> What now?<eos> I think that Hutch is suffering from a sort of conversion disorder -- a psychosomatic illness.<eos> It started with the fear of flying, then it became about the numbness in the arm, and it might eventually become about something else entirely.<eos> So, he's making it up?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It's very real to him.<eos> All right, what could cause this conversion disorder?<eos> It's usually triggered by some external stressors. Mm.

So what, we relocate the entire town? What about the sick, the elderly?<eos> I'll dispatch a fleet from the lot to help with transport.<eos> - Let's do it the best we can. - All right.<eos> Hurry.<eos> I'm so sorry, sweetie. I still haven't seen Angie.<eos> Maybe she's volunteering at the clinic.<eos> We just checked there.<eos> They haven't seen Angie since the first Dome day.<eos> This is Julia Shumway with an emergency broadcast.<eos> I know this news might be difficult for many of you to accept, but I give you my word that it is the truth.

Okay.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> We could have died today in that missile strike.<eos> And instead, the dome ended up protecting us.<eos> And just when we need water... it rains.<eos> I mean, this can't just be a coincidence.<eos> Okay, so what, now the dome's helping us?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe it's trying to reassure us.

It was like the dome wanted me to.<eos> I sound crazy.<eos> It's all crazy.<eos> I helped... a woman give birth.<eos> She said... the dome made her see her husband.<eos> And now there's a new Alice here.<eos> It all... must matter.<eos> No, Mom.<eos> You matter, too.<eos> But if it brought you here, it must want me to go.

I'm a councilman for Chester's Mill, and I'm making my way around to see if our citizens need anything in this time of crisis.<eos> Yes, it is shocking, isn't it?<eos> I'm glad to be here amid the peace and quiet.<eos> Is Mr. Luckland gonna be long?<eos> Uh, c-can I wait for him?<eos> Inside?<eos> We'll have a nice cup of tea.<eos> Great.<eos> What do you think of my grand opening?<eos> I think it's a lot smaller than you're used to, isn't it?

Anything bad happens to me, your secret's still come out.<eos> That's my daughter, Maxine.<eos> Now do me a favour and drop that gun that...<eos> Agatha!<eos> Please!<eos> It's amazing.<eos> It's still just a barn, Galileo.<eos> So all the dots in that egg made constellations but, what does that mean?<eos> Maybe the dome's trying to communicate.<eos> It stopped the riots with rain, made us babble about pink stars...

I'll take them down to the station.<eos> You don't want to do this, I promise.<eos> I already took care of your little insurance policy.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> It's over.<eos> What the hell did you do?<eos> As long as Max is breathing, she's a threat.<eos> Now she's not.<eos> And neither are you.<eos> Barbie, put that weapon down! Put it down now!

I don't think that's your mother.<eos> Forgive us, we're still learning to speak with you.<eos> We've taken on a familiar appearance to help bridge the divide.<eos> What divide?<eos> What the hell are you?<eos> I think, I think it's whoever sent the dome to Chester's Mill.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you punishing us?<eos> The dome wasn't sent to punish you.<eos> It was sent to protect you.
I'll show you what I've done so far!<eos> It's actually an idea of my father's.<eos> You know, I've never really I wanna work on the time travel, I mean that's what I know...<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> It's how you got back here, same explosion that brought back the others, except you landed in 1992 which is two years before I was born...<eos> Do you remember anything from then?<eos> Just after you arrived, people you may have met?<eos> No... well, I told you before... there was a lot of confusion, a lot of gaps...<eos> You really like this work,<eos> Yeah, it has potential.
Should've been Lena Horne in Doris Day's part.<eos> Or Eartha Kitt.<eos> Who?<eos> - You don't know who Eartha Kitt is?<eos> - No.<eos> Hey, Sean, how you doing?<eos> Let's have lunch! That guy is such a fucking cocksucker.<eos> Now, Mickey, listen.<eos> You gotta understand something.<eos> If I buy this story, I own it.
- I hope this isn't too awkward for you. No.<eos> Charlotte!<eos> What just happened?<eos> This is for Padma and Colleen.<eos> - What happened with Trask?<eos> Destroying evidence?<eos> A person's true identity can often be difficult to discern, even to themselves...<eos> Causing one to question their character, their calling, their very existence.<eos> For most, time provides clarity.<eos> But for others, these questions remain unanswered, for an identity cannot be fully defined when it is a guarded secret.
But not as pleasant.<eos> I brought you breakfast.<eos> Where's the file?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Going with you.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause you've got my file.<eos> My boss says there's going to be a task force.<eos> Oh... probably.<eos> Sure you want to be on it?
He's wanted in connection with a double homicide.<eos> He's the one who called it in.<eos> He's trapped in there.<eos> - I need to speak...<eos> - Ma'am, please.<eos> This is as far as you go.<eos> Call him again.<eos> Just... call him again.<eos> Hey... hey!<eos> The bomb is in the ba... It's... it's in the back seat.

I mean, yeah, he's not the sort of guy I've gone out with in the past, But I believe I can change.<eos> Yeah, and I'm sure that I can change, too.<eos> I used to only be into super controlling girls, but now--<eos> Hey, what did I say about talking too much?<eos> Nolan, you don't have to listen to her.<eos> You can talk.<eos> I don't know about this, charlie.<eos> I feel a little creepy installing a tracking program On our daughter's phone.<eos> Look, if we're replacing her phone, we might as well.<eos> It's like when they tag a giraffe so they can see where it migrates, What it eats, and most importantly, To make sure it doesn't mate.
You have to speak louder, or the audience will die of boredom.<eos> June's our prompter.<eos> It won't help matters if we can't hear our own prompter.<eos> The play is about a man and a woman who've met before, but never expressed their emotions.<eos> It's a portrayal of people who involuntarily hurt each other.<eos> I think the play's about our opportunity as humans to change our lives, even as we hurtle toward death.<eos> Right.<eos> So you understand any of this?<eos> Right, will love last?<eos> - Or will it die?

Goodbye.<eos> You should have gone down with your mom.<eos> Nah. You're much more fun.<eos> Charlie!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Rachel went down to level 12.<eos> Militia is everywhere.<eos> You gotta go help her.<eos> We need some meds.<eos> Listen, there's an infirmary, but it's locked.
He's the only reason I'm sticking around.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> Because the machine said this is where I'll find the answer.<eos> What was the question?<eos> Where the machine is located.<eos> Can't it just tell you?<eos> I think Finch programmed it not to, to protect it.<eos> No offense. Maybe Finch wants control of the machine himself.<eos> If Finch had something to do with the virus, I'm sure he had his reasons.<eos> On the upside, hopefully the machine won't have told Root where it is either.
You've never trusted anyone.<eos> Not me, not the machine.<eos> Have you even told your fiancee your real name yet?<eos> I'm waiting for the right moment.<eos> Nathan, please, tell me what I can do to stop you.<eos> Give me back the irrelevant list.<eos> You could even help me.<eos> What, you and me sitting here, trying to rescue them one at a time?<eos> Someone's number's on that thing right now.<eos> It's gonna be erased at midnight.
I know it's a minor matter compared to the total and utter catastrophe I'm looking at here, but...<eos> I didn't think you'd turn traitor, Shaw.<eos> That's a strong word to be throwing around given where we're standing.<eos> What do you want?<eos> A word or two with your new friend.<eos> I always knew there was someone behind Ingram.<eos> Like a black hole.<eos> Invisible, but powerful.<eos> So tell me, where did you move the machine?<eos> It moved itself.

You got an update for me yet, Finch?<eos> This is becoming your version of "Are we there yet," Mr. Reese.<eos> We are not.<eos> It's been ten days since we got a new number.<eos> I'm working as quickly as I can.<eos> Well, work faster.<eos> I don't wanna find out what happens when that clock hits zero, do you?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> Tell me if we're ever gonna get another number, or has that virus destroyed your machine for good?<eos> I believe that the machine is still active, it's just unable to make contact.

You had to know I'd quit eventually.<eos> This is kind of a dead-end job.<eos> You guys don't even offer a 401K.<eos> What do you want, Ms. May?<eos> Information.<eos> And be very careful how you answer my questions.<eos> A good assistant always knows when her boss is lying.<eos> What's happening to you?<eos> We got one?<eos> The machine is being buried under an avalanche of false data, but somehow... it was able to get us his number.
She may have infiltrated the program back in DC, but she bugged out before I could catch her.<eos> I gotta warn Finch.<eos> Police.<eos> Hands on your head.<eos> Hands up.<eos> Nathan, it's me.<eos> I have some good news that I wanted to share with you.<eos> Try me later.<eos> What is this place?<eos> So if you're like me and we both know you are you designed the machine so that a catastrophic crash puts it into a remote debugging protocol a God mode that gives the admin full access to all of its data.

I can understand why you and Harold get along.<eos> Unless you've got some kind of plan to get me the hell out of here.<eos> This is the plan.<eos> - I'm this way.<eos> - I'm driving.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> If the machine figured out that Decima was trying to hijack it, it must have created Thornhill as a defense mechanism.<eos> But why?<eos> It's just a machine, Ms. Groves, and it's malfunctioning.

And what this is all about.<eos> What's in this code?<eos> Memories.<eos> They're its memories.<eos> You call it a life, I call it a machine, but the truth is... somewhere in the middle.<eos> Even when I was building it, I began to encounter anomalies.<eos> As if it had imprinted on me, like a child with a parent.<eos> Then it started looking out for me, altered its own code to take care of me.<eos> It was behaving like a person.<eos> But the world didn't need a person to protect it, it needed a machine.

I'm deleting it.<eos> Well, hang on.<eos> Maybe the Chinese haven't finished watching it yet.<eos> You know, if you're trying to make space on the DVR, why don't you just get rid of some of the stuff you've already watched?<eos> Like, um... Alphas.<eos> No, that's the season two finale.<eos> That was quite the cliffhanger.<eos> I'm going to re-watch it before season three starts.<eos> There is no season three. They canceled that show.<eos> Well, they can't cancel it.

It was cute.<eos> Oh, don't say cute.<eos> That's the worst.<eos> W's wrong with cute?<eos> It just makes things seem small.<eos> It diminishes them.<eos> So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?<eos> You can try, but nobody's gonna believe you.<eos> I don't understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.<eos> I liked it.
Feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.<eos> And that's exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.<eos> Yeah, or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.<eos> Come on, you can do this.<eos> You don't know what it's like to feel completely frustrated.<eos> To have a-a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.<eos> Yeah, sounds like a drag.<eos> Okay, help me out here.<eos> Why does he love this show so much?<eos> Well, there was action, it was funny.

Aside from a few boats, it's a wall of darkness out there.<eos> Phone's dead.<eos> My cell as well. I imagine yours is, too.<eos> Tower's gotta be down.<eos> It's gotta be some kind of freak electrical event.<eos> I suppose the, uh, upside to being so busy with Conrad's campaign is Carl's at his grandmother's for the week.<eos> How quickly the safety of our loved ones trumps other deliberations.<eos> For me, those things are one and the same.<eos> That recording is far from a smoking gun.<eos> I daresay it barely implies Conrad loaded it.
This time, heed my advice, will you?<eos> Shut down the office. Send the employees home. Get yourself back here in front of the cameras with your family where you belong.<eos> I believe it was Yogi Berra who once said, this is like deja vu all over again.<eos> Your glibness never ceases to chill me to the bone.<eos> Have you not given a moment's thought to your children?<eos> Neither came home last night.<eos> They are both safe and sound at campaign headquarters.<eos> And I brought the chopper to personally escort you to town for a camera-ready reunion. Mm.<eos> Well, you seem awfully confident that this election's going to turn in your favor.<eos> Well, it already has, thanks to you, in part.
Come on. Pick up.<eos> - This is Jack.<eos> Leave a message. - Voice mail.<eos> All right, Jack, do not go into Grayson Global.<eos> You... You are being set up.<eos> Get out of there.<eos> Whichever candidate you support, it is more important than ever that we exercise our civil duty.<eos> Uh, there is still plenty of time to go out and convince your friend, your neighbor, your family to bravely venture into this storm of uncertainty and elect your next governor.<eos> And I implore you to make sure that your voice is heard in this election.<eos> Because it's not just a vote.

No, the kids with OCD don't cause a lot of our traditional problems.<eos> By the way, did you know that she has her own meat thermometer?<eos> Cafeteria staff would really appreciate it if you took it away.<eos> It's slowing down the lunches.<eos> Well, it was all she wanted for Christmas, but sure.<eos> I'm sorry, Miss Goodson, but I really only needed to talk to Charlie.<eos> We need your help.<eos> Our baseball coach Mr. Henderson, he just left us to be on a reality show.<eos> Ooh, which one?<eos> I believe it's called "Hook-up Island."
Okay, "that Donnie".<eos> Here's the deal. - I need an MRI.<eos> - Why?<eos> It seemed pretty clear to me in the first two minutes that the guy is competent.<eos> Hell, he's downright articulate.<eos> You have more than enough to form an expert opinion. Exactly, expert.<eos> I'm the expert.<eos> And I'm not forming any opinion until I've thoroughly examined the subject.<eos> And to do that, I need an MRI.<eos> The bullet bored through his Prefrontal Cortex like a power drill, but it completely missed his Optic Chiasm, his Trochlear Nerve, the Genu of the Corpus Callosum. Okay, Daniel, slow down.
Sleeping with your best friend was not my most shining moment. Wow.<eos> Big of you to admit it.<eos> But since we're gonna be working together now, the least we could do is try to be civil.<eos> Here, I ordered from Hop Li, your favorite. Sit down.<eos> Have an egg roll.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> How about you take that egg roll, shove it up your ass.<eos> I can't believe how good this is.<eos> Pizza is like sex.<eos> Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.
Daniel, who are you talking to?<eos> Myself.<eos> I know how picky you can be about your tea. - I hope I got you the right kind.<eos> - I'm not that picky.<eos> I like a lot of tea. - Well...<eos> - You're a little picky.<eos> Maybe I'm a little picky.<eos> Can people really change?<eos> Is our personality genetically pre-programmed?<eos> Or is it malleable?
Make me!<eos> Make me, come on!<eos> Kiera!<eos> Ease up!<eos> - What're you doing?<eos> ! - What're you doing?<eos> It's the military chip they put in her head, it makes her loco, you better watch that.<eos> Maybe you need to wake up, start thinking for yourself?<eos> This kind of tactic gets us nowhere.<eos> Or maybe it got me exactly what I wanted.
- Doesn't matter.<eos> - It matters to me.<eos> You're alive.<eos> That's all you need to know.<eos> What about the future?<eos> You said this all had something to do with Kagame... you said you knew what I was going to become.<eos> Talked about all the people I would kill, I mean, in the thousands.<eos> As if it had already happened.<eos> Kagame and Sonya used the exact same point of reference, the future is set, my destiny with it.<eos> It's not set.
Can I help you?<eos> No, it's a union thing.<eos> Aren't you in there a little long?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let me just--<eos> Caroline, that special effects rig you're wearing is very sensitive, so don't let anything near your chest.<eos> Except me.<eos> And don't be nervous.<eos> The camera's gonna love you.<eos> How could it not?
You know I know.<eos> Mike told me.<eos> Nobody had to tell me after you sent me on that wild goose chase after American Gigolo.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> You know, it's not that you violated the sanctity of our friendship.<eos> It's that you violated the sanctity of Richard Gere-- something I would like to do, but not the way you did it.<eos> Look, I was just trying to get Mike back with Harvey.<eos> I understand.<eos> Because I never want their thing to be our thing.<eos> It's not.
Because she'll never forgive me.<eos> Because you'll never forgive yourself.<eos> Okay, what is so important that we need to have an emergency hearing?<eos> Your Honor, we need to be heard before demolition starts.<eos> What's he going to do now, tell us about his first demolition?<eos> It was riveting, but this has nothing to do that.<eos> Your Honor, based on the new zoning put through for their project, we're simply asking for a revised valuation of the property that they're taking.<eos> $100 million?<eos> That valuation has no basis.<eos> It has a mathematical basis.
He's gone down the escalator.<eos> He's on the first level.<eos> All right, he's leaving the main area.<eos> It looks like a...<eos> like a maintenance area.<eos> Uh, I lost his Overwatch signature, but I still have the button cam on his jacket.<eos> Which way, Eric?<eos> Go to your left.<eos> You should see a door to maintenance.<eos> It leads to a hallway behind the stores that runs the length of the mall.
I'd love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don't like bangs.<eos> I like your bangs.<eos> Oh, thanks, I like 'em, too.<eos> What else?<eos> Mm... it's kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.<eos> Mm, yeah.<eos> Those are both toughies.<eos> I know.<eos> I have a two-year subscription to Guns Ammo.<eos> I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
Come on.<eos> Let's go back out there.<eos> Y...<eos> Well, no. Hold on.<eos> My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them.<eos> We wouldn't really be playing the game right if we didn't see that through.<eos> Okay.<eos> I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon.<eos> While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armor.<eos> It comes off.
So I should have that, and so should you, Mina.<eos> I'm sorry, darling, but I don't know how someone so bright can enjoy something as simpleminded as parlor magic.<eos> - So how's it done, then?<eos> - It's simple, really.<eos> Why, Mr. Grayson.<eos> You have a gift for making London seem small.<eos> Miss Murray, you're looking lovely tonight, as ever.<eos> Permit me to explain.<eos> The card is folded down the middle and is torn, but not the whole way.<eos> It is folded back in itself, and you mime... Tearing the card in half...

Tearing the card in half...<eos> - Good heavens.<eos> - So it appears to be torn.<eos> But really, it's still in one place.
Well, that narrows things down a bit.<eos> He's hardly inconspicuous.<eos> Leave it with me.<eos> Jonathan?<eos> I really must be going, Mina. Wa...<eos> Is this list right?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I have some urgent business to attend to. We'll have to discuss this later.<eos> But the party is tonight.<eos> It's in a few hours.
I'm emotionally disabled. Anyway, if I had told him, he would never have kissed me.<eos> Angélique.<eos> Let's forget everything.<eos> End of story. There must be a solution.<eos> You can't give up like that. It's obvious you're made for each other.<eos> Look around you.<eos> Where is the good fairy?<eos> It's paradise.<eos> Do you think my allergy is psychosomatic?<eos> And you? What do you think about it?
Zarya-2, here is Kedr.<eos> I can good to hear everything is ok.<eos> Everything is fine!<eos> The second stage is ignited I feel good.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Just has the Cover detached.<eos> I see the Earth through the porthole!<eos> The earth is clearly visible!<eos> I can rivers and See mountain ranges.<eos> The visibility is good, it is outstanding!
Grandma Look, times, what is it?<eos> There comes a from the sky!<eos> Grandma, who is that?<eos> We should leave here, but fast!<eos> Go, run, my child!<eos> Wait!<eos> I belong to you, I am a Soviet!<eos> The weight of the manned Space capsule is 4730 kg,<eos> The name of the rocket Vostok.<eos> It will orbit the earth once.
Oh, my God, son, you're alive.<eos> Aw, man.<eos> Now I haven't met any dead people.<eos> I guess when they found nothing but my laptop and that necklace, they assumed I was dead.<eos> Turns out you can't trust a monkey with a note.<eos> You were gone for two weeks.<eos> What were you doing that whole time?<eos> Guess I needed time to think... about us.<eos> Oh, and how you were gonna break up with me via video message, which is just like a notch above a text, by the way.<eos> I never sent that message because it wasn't true.
Your phone was off.<eos> Are you OK, sir?<eos> We've interviewed the two divers who discovered the body, sir.<eos> They're amateurs. They were just out for a bit of fun apparently.<eos> According to the doctor, the body's been down there weeks... months.<eos> Young male, naked apart from his underwear.<eos> The divers.<eos> They broke in just before dawn.<eos> They found the body ten metres down.<eos> It was tied to something.
Take a photo.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> She has quite a lot of imagination.<eos> It's really incredible what she did for us or for the movie.<eos> That's really incredible.<eos> Show me.<eos> Can you take the camera for a second?<eos> I have to pee.<eos> Just turn it off.<eos> - Come on, take it!
It's not gonna be cheap.<eos> - Is that your girlfriend?<eos> - Yeah, she is.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm just happy you're here.<eos> Well, good. Don't forget it.<eos> Sean fucking Walker?<eos> I have evidence that he shot a girl in Boston 20 years ago.<eos> And then he frames a working joe from an honest family for the murder.<eos> If I buy this story, I own it.
Karev brought him in?<eos> - Yeah. I think that he's...<eos> - Mnh-mnh.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Do you have a 4-1/2-inch angle grinder with a cutoff wheel?<eos> Dr. Bailey, I'm thrilled that you're back and honored that you requested me.<eos> I'm very excited to be in your O.R.<eos> So what are we doing?<eos> Press "print," go to the printer, take the chart, collate it, repeat.
All right.<eos> Come right over here next to me.<eos> Here, go through these again and just make sure they're in order.<eos> Dr. Bailey, is there a reason you chose me to do this?<eos> Because you're an intern.<eos> A surgical intern, at a hospital, not a kinko's.<eos> Just... since Dr. Shepherd kicked me off his service, I worry that everyone thinks I'm a losing bet.<eos> And if that's what people think...<eos> Do you want to be responsible for killing a patient, Ross?<eos> If the power goes out and we lose access to a patient's electronic files and we reach for her chart in this pile and it's not there, what will happen?
Any leaks?<eos> I'm... not sure.<eos> Yes or no, Brooks.<eos> Confidence.<eos> No, sir.<eos> No leaks.<eos> Good.<eos> Dr. Shepherd, you have a message.<eos> - Yeah, not now.<eos> - It's from Dr. Grey.
What do you do for a living?<eos> I act. Shut up, guys.<eos> I didn't remember you were an actor.<eos> - So, you do mainly theater?<eos> - Well, I did.<eos> Since I moved down here to support my wife and her Skyping career.<eos> Um, but, no, I was in a TV show for about four years.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> What was that?<eos> - It was called Roswell. Oh, my God.
What about it?<eos> Well... Don't you think it looks weird?<eos> It's the lightning.<eos> The bonsai is fine! Maybe you should water it, Amélie?<eos> If you like.<eos> We watered it earlier.<eos> You shouldn't water bonsais too much.<eos> 1In the last metro<eos> We take the last metro home.<eos> It's almost empty.
I love you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Say something.<eos> It's Mischief Night.<eos> Dad!<eos> Shh, shh, shh.<eos> It's me, it's me. You've got to find that gun, Emily.<eos> It's right by the front door.
No, we're not leaving without Nick.<eos> I followed my brother to one of the containers, where I found Nick's cell one.<eos> My brother's gonna try to get him out of the country.<eos> - What?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> We got to get to the airport.<eos> Come on!<eos> I saw them carry the box and load it in a van.<eos> What kind of box was it?<eos> It, uh, looked like a coffin.
Remember what I told you about the different ways this treatment can be given?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Orally, "ointmentally"...<eos> Or by shot.<eos> What about an inhalant?<eos> Oh, you mean we get 'em to smoke it?<eos> No, breathe it.<eos> That could be done. How?<eos> With the Williamson ether synthesis.<eos> It turns a liquid into a gas.
Back here.<eos> Can you follow him?<eos> - I can try.<eos> We've got to stop him because it's only gonna get worse.<eos> Go.<eos> - That's deep enough.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> Put them in.<eos> Put the box in the earth.<eos> It must be buried with your hands.

Show me.<eos> (sighs): Oh, Earl.<eos> Hey, something's come up.<eos> I'm not gonna make that flight.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be on a plane?<eos> What's the, uh, big "emergency"?<eos> Your dad's here.<eos> Hi, son.<eos> Come to see your girlfriend? He has blood poisoning.<eos> It's headed up his arm towards his heart.
- Murder. Involving Sean Walker.<eos> Van Miller's off the reservation.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> Wait in your office.<eos> I'm sending something over now.<eos> Now touch your nose.<eos> And I got an idea for a movie you should do.<eos> It's about an unknown actor, ends up shooting a young woman in the head.<eos> Then he frames a working joe from an honest family for the murder.<eos> If I buy this story, I own it.
- You want cuffs on your trouser?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let's ask your dad.<eos> All right.<eos> It's a bar mitzvah?<eos> No, Kids' Choice Awards tonight.<eos> A guest of Tommy Wheeler.<eos> Hi.<eos> Is this awards show for real?<eos> If it's not gonna happen, I'd rather tell him now.

The roads are wonderful.<eos> Spitting is forbidden.<eos> Newspapers are free here.<eos> Hello, madam.<eos> You have to pay for newspapers here.<eos> Momentarily, just this one time, I'll replace the tourist office.<eos> You put your coin here then you take your paper.<eos> - Alright.<eos> - Got it?<eos> Put the newspaper back or pay for it.
Well, Niklaus is here because he learned that a witch was conspiring against him, someone by the name of Jane-Anne Deveraux.<eos> Well, if he's looking for Jane-Anne, he's a little late.<eos> Are you telling me she's dead?<eos> Come on.<eos> Her sister Sophie is gonna wanna talk to you.<eos> That's Jane-Anne?<eos> Killed in public for anyone to find.<eos> Only people come 'round here are the witches.<eos> Now her sister has come to take her body.<eos> Her spirit can't rest until it's been properly interred in the cemetery.
Guy's just a middle man.<eos> But he did confirm he sold to Nathan Barnes five days ago.<eos> How about his supplier?<eos> White, early 40s, goes by the name "Boosh."<eos> Really?<eos> I'm never this lucky.<eos> - What, you know him?<eos> - Yeah, I know him. We've had eyes on him for a while.<eos> William Bouchard.<eos> Listen, call up his file, send it to Swarek.
Well, actually, what else can I speak? Amazing.<eos> Seriously, Chloe, you were a rock star today.<eos> ♪ I was gonna go back home Gracias. ♪ I was gonna go back home<eos> Chuck the pothead just wanted to be somebody.<eos> Yeah, it's going around these days.<eos> Your first homicide case.<eos> You nailed it. May I?<eos> ♪<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, you said you didn't recognize my number when it shows up, so... (Buttons click) I thought I'd make it easier for you.
Yeah, one of the perks of being shot, I guess.<eos> Looks good on you.<eos> McNally, hold up.<eos> You're in for the rest of the shift.<eos> Check in with the D's, see what they need.<eos> Sir, you just said you need every uniform officer on the street.<eos> Look, I read the report.<eos> You took a bullet today, which means you do not go out there, okay?<eos> Brass' orders.<eos> - It just grazed my jacket.
You and I both know--"<eos> Did you want us? Yes.<eos> Get everyone.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Just listen.<eos> I've got it.<eos> Great.<eos> Remember this work?<eos> I've never seen it before.<eos> Well, it says it all. It really does.
Did you want us? Yes.<eos> Get everyone.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Just listen.<eos> I've got it.<eos> Great.<eos> Remember this work?<eos> I've never seen it before.<eos> Well, it says it all. It really does.<eos> Okay, I've got this great message and it has to do with what holds people together.
Let's say I get her face to face. How do I capture her imagination?<eos> I have a sentence, maybe two.<eos> Who's "her"?<eos> Promise them everything.<eos> You know, you're gonna change their life.<eos> - You're gonna take away their pain.<eos> - That's good. Then you hit 'em with the one-two punch.<eos> What's the answer to all of life's problems?<eos> A Chevy.<eos> No, it's not.
How many?<eos> Got it.<eos> Got a body off Van Dyke.<eos> Take Hernandez.<eos> - Geddes.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You go, too.<eos> Leave me the address.<eos> I'll have to meet you there.<eos> It's right here.
- they'll turn on each other quick.<eos> - They always do.<eos> David Sutton is a predator, but it does look like one of these girls mowed him down.<eos> Well, let's split up, each take a girl.<eos> It's gonna be like shooting fish in a bucket.<eos> We have evidence that you were in the shed with Mr. Sutton.<eos> CHLOE:<eos> He was my hero.<eos> He made me fall in love with science. He...<eos> He said that it was an art and that we were the artists.
Let's go, son!<eos> Let's go, buddy!<eos> Hey!<eos> That was a cross-check, ref!<eos> - Are you blind?<eos> ! - Excuse me.<eos> I'm watching a game here.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Use the whistle!<eos> That's what it's for!
Puncture wound is 0.5 centimeters at the apex.<eos> 12.7 centimeters ofjagged tear.<eos> [GROANS]<eos> It's like someone pulled her throat open with claws.<eos> What kind of murder weapon does that?<eos> It snagged the carotid.<eos> Notice I said "snagged."<eos> I noticed.<eos> Notice how much I would love to know what the murder weapon is.<eos> Carotid artery was pulled until it tore.
- What was the cause of death?<eos> - Drowning.<eos> And what did Carla think happened to her brother-in-law and her nephew?<eos> She was convinced that Michael killed his wife faked his own death so he could take their son.<eos> What did you think?<eos> That she didn't have any proof.<eos> Did Carla know if Michael ever threatened her sister?<eos> She said there was tension in the marriage that Bridget had some terrible illness.<eos> - Huntington's disease. - Yes, that's it.<eos> It's passed down from the mother.
Look, I-I j...<eos> I-I have to stay focused here.<eos> I know there is a-a connection between the dead ref and the dead judge.<eos> Now, I...<eos> I thought maybe...<eos> Maybe lemmons had been in cleland's court at some point, as... as a plaintiff or...<eos> Or a defendant, maybe even on a jury, but there's nothing.<eos> I can't... what am I missing?<eos> Maybe the obvious... That the profiler is right.<eos> Hey, just because I haven't found the connection yet doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
I was gonna say "interested."<eos> The truth is, neither one of us are probably any good for her.<eos> So, we should just let her move on with her life.<eos> I'm sure as hell not standing in her way.<eos> Really?<eos> Because to my eyes, it... it looks like you're leading her on.<eos> And I'm not saying that you're doing it on purpose.<eos> I'm just saying that if you care about her... And I think you do... Maybe you should let her know you're not interested.<eos> What if I told all of you that you're partially blind?<eos> That right now, you think you're seeing the world as it truly is, but in actuality, you're missing something.
Listen, um, e-Kat and I got back together.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> The whole camp saw.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Don't worry about our little kiss.<eos> I will find a way to carry on.<eos> Yeah, look, um, we're moving into this condo.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Well, the thing is it only has two bedrooms, and e-Kat really needs one of them for her pilates machine.
God.<eos> Steve strikes again?<eos> I am gonna straight up murder him.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> I'm sick of this game anyway.<eos> He's one of mine.<eos> Lou, come here, baby.<eos> Where are you guys hiding the flag?<eos> Not telling.<eos> It's at point doom.
As some of you might remember, Ridgefield went all out last year...<eos> Totally lame.<eos> - Way over the top.<eos> But we're Camp Little Otter.<eos> We don't need smoke and mirrors and a special performance by Justin Timberlake to have a good time.<eos> Tomorrow night, 8:00...<eos> See you there.<eos> Nobody even likes cantaloupe.<eos> I do.<eos> In fact, it is my favorite fruit.

No, I'm a good swimmer.<eos> You know who is a better swimmer than you are?<eos> My neighbor's kid.<eos> She's five.<eos> She's got one arm.<eos> She's a better swimmer than you are.<eos> The slim noodle... Throw it to me.<eos> You know who else is a better swimmer than you?<eos> My grandma.<eos> - The noodle-throw it.
Let me hazard a guess.<eos> You're not a fan of my work.<eos> Oh, let's say that I'm aware of your work.<eos> Ah, the curse of indifference.<eos> Oh, I'm just surprised that you're so anti-therapy when many of "Powers Pillars" have therapeutic roots.<eos> I'm not anti-therapy.<eos> I'm pro-active.<eos> I prefer not to dwell on the past.<eos> Oh, I don't dwell on it.<eos> I help people come to terms with it so they can move forward.
Can't forget that every now and then you need to...decompress.<eos> And you were right.<eos> These martinis are awesome.<eos> My best friend fell in love over one of these. Oh?<eos> I can see how.<eos> Last call.<eos> Could you just put it on the room? Of course.<eos> Thank you. Ohh.<eos> Looks like the party's coming to an end.<eos> Maybe it doesn't have to.
Project Orange gets under way tomorrow morning at dawn.<eos> What's our target?<eos> We won't know until we go.<eos> "We" won't know, or you're not telling me?<eos> It's standard military procedure.<eos> You evaluate your target options till the last minute.<eos> And then you go with the best one.<eos> We've got all our eggs in this basket, Dan.<eos> What if this weapon doesn't work?<eos> Or what if it does?
- Tom's back.<eos> Dan.<eos> It's Tom Mason.<eos> I heard you came strolling in.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> And I'll bet you have a good story to tell.<eos> - I got a story.<eos> - Dad.<eos> - It's not good.
Smart.<eos> You almost done?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just about.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> There's a crack in the support beam right over my head.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> It depends on whether its load-bearing capacity's been compromised.<eos> Our explosion could punch right through to the stairwell or it could collapse the ceiling and bury the hall in rubble.
Yeah.<eos> As a team.<eos> It's good to see you back on your feet, my friend.<eos> My comrades -- gone.<eos> Like me, they never laid eyes upon their homeland.<eos> And now to die here in a strange land... forgotten.<eos> And we'll make sure they didn't die in vain.<eos> It is too late.<eos> You built your weapon in a bunker designed to withstand a Beamer attack. Isn't it possible that it survived?<eos> It most certainly did.

Isn't it possible that it survived?<eos> It most certainly did.<eos> But it is buried beneath that wreckage, and all of my engineers are dead.
Why did you have it?<eos> And why did you lie to me about it?<eos> It was in my locker, okay?<eos> The day after Regina died, someone just left it there for me.<eos> Whoever killed her must have known that that necklace belonged to Aunt Tara.<eos> They knew that it would make me look guilty.<eos> Yeah, well, they were right.<eos> You think this means that I killed Regina, don't you?<eos> I just don't understand why you wouldn't get rid of it.<eos> I tried, but it was all I had.
He was one of a kind.<eos> Definitely.<eos> And Danny worshiped him.<eos> Karen, have you focused on anything but Danny since he got back?<eos> Like what?<eos> I have nothing to do, I don't have any real hobbies, and I haven't had a job in years.<eos> Well, maybe it's time you get one.<eos> A hobby, or even a job.<eos> So, want to finish making your vase? Sure.<eos> How's it looking?
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system... a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Can you hear me?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Robin, did you hear anything I just said?<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, some of the patients have complained about you talking late into the night, and since cell phones are strictly forbidden and you have no roommate, I can only conclude that you're talking to yourself.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Try me.<eos> I have a direct line to a higher power.<eos> It speaks to me.
Never a dull moment with you guys.<eos> Here, Carter came through.<eos> Address for the fence in the Flatiron district.<eos> These ruskies are ruthless and packing' serious heat.<eos> Sounds like a job for Shaw.<eos> Besides, someone needs to defuse that bomb.<eos> Hup to, Lionel.<eos> What?<eos> Nobody said anything about defusing a bomb.<eos> Be careful, it's got a fail safe.

Wait, you don't understand who you're screwing with.<eos> Who?<eos> A man with no gun and no backup?<eos> Maybe we keep our money and your diamonds.<eos> We don't renegotiate.<eos> Another fine Navy day.<eos> You must be Maksim.<eos> You said 50 cents on the dollar.<eos> That was before I saw the merchandise.<eos> You failed to mention it's from Africa.
Hey, somebody call Meredith Grey up in maternity.<eos> Tell her, "When you know, you know"!<eos> It was a beautiful wedding.<eos> - What you said...<eos> - Can we not?<eos> Why are you snapping at me all day?<eos> - I'm not snapping.<eos> - Yeah, you are.<eos> I'm sorry I asked the question.<eos> It obviously made you really uncomfortable, and I guess that's my answer.
And if everything goes as planned, that'll be the last one the Graysons ever attend.<eos> One day before its debut, and you're still missing the depth in my eyes. Arctic pools, Laila.<eos> Arctic pools.<eos> Uh...<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Finally achieving the immortality you've always hoped for.<eos> Oh, no, my legacy lies in the work I'm getting done.<eos> It's a springboard both for the state's rehabilitation and my ascension to the higher offices to which I'm destined.<eos> To that extent, I've been going over the specs of the party Ms. Thorne's been kind enough to throw in your mother's dormancy, and while security is acceptable for a typical Hamptons hobnob, it's sorely inadequate for a future presidential candidate, so we will be adding handheld metal detectors
We, uh...<eos> Damn it, what is that?<eos> Please step back.<eos> It's okay.<eos> The press is getting antsy.<eos> Someone should probably make a statement.<eos> Maybe we should wait until we have something to say.<eos> I was concerned after your syncope that your collapse may have been something hypoperfusive.<eos> So I ran a full panel.<eos> And it came back with a C.A.G. score of 48.
Gave me an ultimatum.<eos> Well, that's heavy.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Have the wedding of the century.<eos> Take down Victoria once and for all.<eos> When's the big date?<eos> August 8th.<eos> A fitting end... To a path of revenge.<eos> Fear is the most primal of emotions.<eos> It can linger as a memory burned into one's mind of a parent taken too soon.
If I can, what would you like me to tell them?<eos> Tell Emma I'm alive, and I love her.<eos> How long was he with you?<eos> Long enough for me to know that I miss him, too.<eos> What was that?<eos> What the hell are you two doing? !<eos> Trying to keep it steady! Hold on!<eos> Prepare for attack!<eos> Be more specific.<eos> If you've got a weapon, then grab it!
We'll celebrate tonight.<eos> I love you. - Celebrate what?<eos> - Oh.<eos> Well, Jay, hold on to your hat... but as of today in California... it's legal for a man to marry another man!<eos> Ew. He threw up.<eos> He just needs some time to get used to the idea, honey.<eos> It's so great, Cam.<eos> Yeah, I'm happy for you guys.<eos> Gloria, Manny needs his birth certificate to reenter the country.<eos> - Any idea where it is?
How did it go?<eos> Did you- it didn't happen.<eos> I have to go with the backup plan.<eos> Fortunately, I had an alternate proposal scenario in case there was a problem.<eos> Jay and Gloria were babysitting, so I asked them to recreate the picnic under the stars we had... the night we moved into our first apartment.<eos> Mitchell would take one look and- Sob like a Tony winner.<eos> I got the picnic basket, but you know what is going to be hard to find?<eos> My interest in this whole damn thing?<eos> No. The blue and white tablecloth.<eos> Here it is. it was in the occasion closet.
Come on, sir.<eos> What game are you really playing?<eos> Better stow your gear.<eos> How will you come at us?<eos> From the air?<eos> From the ground?<eos> How will you silence us this time?<eos> How can you?<eos> The truth is in the wind.<eos> It's everywhere.
I'm not him anymore.<eos> I'm someone else now.<eos> Please.<eos> You're juiced, Mike!<eos> And you're losing it just like the last guy.<eos> God, this is a disaster.<eos> No.<eos> It's an origin story.<eos> Audio file should be coming through.<eos> It's not compressed, so it might take a minute.
Oh, I can't wait to get back to you.<eos> I know I have to wait a week, but what I really wish is that you were here with me.<eos> We're gonna find her, John.<eos> If you hadn't come back...<eos> You saved a lot of lives.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks for insisting.<eos> You put in the rec order.<eos> For Dorian.<eos> I checked out his record. It's mostly redacted, but I saw that it was you who put in the request for me to get him.
So if you need to wear it, if you really need to, which is your right, you better be the best analyst we've ever seen, and that means don't tell me there's nothing.<eos> Give me a plan.<eos> Give me a goddamn plan or don't say anything.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> You understand the mission now, what we're trying to do here? Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> I...<eos> What?<eos> I have a plan.<eos> Well, tell it to me.
You sent the e-mail.<eos> Subject line is "Do not reference Iran."<eos> We have the phony wire transfers-- thousands of them.<eos> We want the real ones with the real names.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> That's your question?<eos> Your client is funding attacks by terrorists on this country, and all you want to know is how did we find out?<eos> So who did you say this is again?<eos> You know your bank?<eos> It's been trafficking in human misery since the opium wars.
Take off your clothes.<eos> Everything. No.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I'll do it.<eos> Yes?<eos> I think the watch is back on.<eos> What are you seeing?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I put a GoPro camera on her street but it's not showing anything.
We cannot afford to spook him or alert his men.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Well, how can we be sure he's still there?<eos> I know this man.<eos> Survival's the only thing on his mind right now.<eos> He will not take any unnecessary risks with his life.<eos> You don't think he could have changed a little since you last saw him?<eos> He will keep that meeting with you.<eos> Till then you should get some sleep.<eos> Quinn will deliver the file to you when it's ready... and provide back-up at the meeting point.
- in the next few minutes, he's dead. - Iraqi call signs are requesting an artillery fire mission up the chain.<eos> How far out are our helicopters? Eight minutes.<eos> General, advice?<eos> Eight minutes is time we don't have.<eos> - Either we call the Iraqis and level with them...<eos> - Also time we don't have and every shade of blowback we can't afford.<eos> So it's a fighting withdrawal to a secure LZ, back five clicks in the vehicle that they have left.<eos> In other words, we have to abort.<eos> The intelligence operation is over.<eos> It's a military one now.
Have you seen Mia?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I showed her this.<eos> She acted as if she didn't even know me.<eos> She knew me. I could see it in her eyes.<eos> It's like when you can't remember a word and it's on the tip of your tongue.<eos> I need to get through to her somehow.<eos> Take her to the carving.<eos> She thinks I'm a psycho.<eos> Then take it to her.
And there's my migraine.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Divya!<eos> - Santi?<eos> Santi.<eos> Divya, thank God you came.<eos> What happened... dizzy again?<eos> It's worse.<eos> I feel better now, but...<eos> - My voice... it hurts.
I think she's threatened.<eos> Blythe Ballard is threatened by me.<eos> Okay, that's ridiculous!<eos> Sorry. I didn't mean to sound so emphatic.<eos> Just think about it.<eos> She's used to getting her own way all the time.<eos> She manipulates the council.<eos> She manipulated me into this whole signature-gathering time suck, but this isn't about me anymore.<eos> What this town needs is dissent, Paige.<eos> It needs an outside voice.

Private things about my family?<eos> Why didn't your father's criminal record show up on your background report?<eos> We need to contact the SWAT commander at Quantico.<eos> Roll a team out to the girl.<eos> This is nonsense. He's bluffing, sir.<eos> No, he's establishing value.<eos> I've been the case agent on this guy for five years.<eos> And five years has gotten you what?<eos> You asked me here, you asked my opinion.<eos> Here it is...
I can't see!<eos> I got blood in my...<eos> Get the girl!<eos> If you want to save the girl, do not fire your weapon.<eos> Take it.<eos> Okay, baby, this smoke's gonna hurt us. All right?<eos> I need you to put this on for me.<eos> - What about you?<eos> - There's only one.<eos> It's for you, hon.
I can't understand what you're saying.<eos> Can you stop the bomb?<eos> Can you stop it?<eos> - Are we gonna be okay?<eos> - Yeah, baby, we're gonna be okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was scared when I was your age, too.<eos> But I had a secret weapon to keep me safe.<eos> My daddy gave it to me.<eos> It's very special.

No one posted outside any of our doors or in that corridor saw someone leave your room - with a body or a dying girl.<eos> - And they would have.<eos> They must have used the passageway.<eos> Clarissa?<eos> We can play if you want.<eos> But I need your help.<eos> If you can hear me, come and find me.<eos> Does this mean you'll speak to me?<eos> I have a guessing game for you.<eos> I'm going to guess something, and if I guess right, you roll the marble back to me; if I guess wrong, you keep it, it's yours.
Mistakes were made.<eos> We tried to bring Colin back even though he was a traitor. If he's a traitor, then what are you?<eos> Who are you loyal to?<eos> My family, France, you, as they are one and the same.<eos> Because you can't trust father and he can't divorce you.<eos> I mean, you must wonder what he'd do to you if he could, so you put all your hopes, your survival on the favor of the next King...me... but, mother...<eos> You must understand that my, my marriage to Mary, to anyone won't change my loyalty to you.<eos> Is the pull so strong?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.
When you imagine...<eos> The power of the imagination is our superpower.<eos> The reality is... often disappointing.<eos> - Now that we're here...<eos> - We may as well enjoy it.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> I don't understand it.<eos> Do jellyfish breathe?<eos> Er, no.<eos> But it's alive.

Like a fish.
I don't understand it.<eos> Do jellyfish breathe?<eos> Er, no.<eos> But it's alive.<eos> Yes, but it doesn't breathe. Like a fish.<eos> A fish doesn't breathe?<eos> Like an oyster.<eos> So, when it's washed up, it's dead?<eos> Yes.<eos> How can it sting you if it's dead?
Who's gonna say "no" to that?<eos> The cost, the consequences, it all seems manageable in comparison.<eos> Yes, I heard about your miracle hand.<eos> What were the consequences of that transaction?<eos> Worse than I ever imagined.<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> Whoever you are, you don't need to do this.<eos> I know the Shop made you a slave, and they turned you into some--no!<eos> You helped me out in Columbia. I don't want to have to kill you.<eos> Now drop it.
You know a little something about that.<eos> Easy.<eos> Where are we?<eos> We're safe.<eos> A bubble has now been created for Nikita to believe in.<eos> She will tell her story, and make the rest of the world believe it as well.<eos> As long as they remain in that bubble, we'll continue with business as usual.<eos> Nikita's too smart.<eos> Your illusion won't hold.<eos> Yes, it will.
Uh, how y'all doin'?<eos> Chief Wiggum, how come every time there's a terrorist chatter in this town, you come to me?<eos> Lay off, Apu.<eos> When I look at people, I don't see colors.<eos> I just see crackpot religions.<eos> Chief, is there really a terrorist threat to Springfield?<eos> Yeah. I got a very important phone call.<eos> Yello?<eos> Is this line secure?<eos> Uh, it's a little jiggly but it'll hold.
Fine!<eos> Facial recognition required.<eos> Welcome, Mr. Burns.<eos> Dad?<eos> Huh? How'd you get in here?<eos> Girl Scout cookies get you in anywhere.<eos> Please don't do this, Dad.<eos> I don't know what horrors you saw in Boise, but it's not worth blowing up everyone you love.<eos> I'm not blowing up the plant.<eos> Oh. Just harmlessly stopping it from doing more damage to Mother Earth.
- Grab the chains. - What?<eos> Grab the chains.<eos> Get in.<eos> I said, get in.<eos> Are you not hearing me, son?<eos> Get in the damn freezer!<eos> Get in!<eos> Well, there goes that.<eos> Didn't you say the sign said 198?<eos> It was 198.
Hey, Scott, you okay?<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's just books.<eos> You brought homework?<eos> Well, should I let you get back to it?<eos> Hell no.<eos> What's that?<eos> I have two of them, from a surgery I had to correct misshapen cartilage I was born with.<eos> I had a bar put in when I was 14.<eos> It stayed there for two years to support my sternum, so my heart and lungs wouldn't be crushed.
God, I wish I lived here.<eos> - Did I wake you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - There's a rat in my apartment.<eos> Told you to get traps.<eos> It's in the trap and it's mortally wounded.<eos> I'm pretty sure 'cause there's a lot of blood.<eos> Did you call an ambulance?<eos> You have to come over.<eos> It went under the couch.

What if it's still alive?
I'm afraid it's the latter.<eos> Women are working.<eos> They're not home.<eos> And hippies don't wear makeup at all.<eos> I'm not sure if we should try to be "groovier" or nostalgic.<eos> We're somewhere in between right now.<eos> That's about it.<eos> Peggy? Yes, Joan?<eos> What do you think of your current work?<eos> Besides the fact that it's not working?

Yes, Joan?<eos> What do you think of your current work?<eos> Besides the fact that it's not working?<eos> It's okay.<eos> We didn't do it.<eos> I don't know how to describe it.<eos> Would you say it's unintentionally old-fashioned?
If they're strong enough to help us survive this thing, yeah, I think you made the right call.<eos> And if they're not?<eos> Let's hope they are.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rick...<eos> I killed two people and you haven't said a word about it.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> It's not about what you say.<eos> It's about facing reality.<eos> It always comes for us and over and over again we face it so that we can live.
But maybe I can offer him something he needs.<eos> Hey, I heard what happened.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - His rib is fractured.<eos> - Yeah, I took one for the team.<eos> - Uh, well actually, you didn't step in front of that ball on purpose, you stumbled.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I lost my balance.<eos> This muscle weakness is...<eos> it's getting worse.
Stay there.<eos> Tim?<eos> Tim?<eos> It happened again.<eos> Hm?<eos> I woke up this morning and I found this.<eos> Oh, for fuck... Do you...?<eos> What?<eos> Fucking gun!<eos> I don't know where it came from, but it can't be good.
Um... just give me a minute to think about... that.<eos> Er... actually, I don't need a full minute.<eos> It's a no.<eos> It's a man and his name's Mark.<eos> He's trapped in here and he can't get out.<eos> That is really tragic.<eos> Mm.<eos> But I'm still not fucking your tortoise.<eos> You have no idea, do you?<eos> I found out what my power is and it's totally useless.
[Nina] Well, I actually am single... - And Eric has come as a supportive friend.<eos> Reluctantly supportive friend.<eos> But he's here, nonetheless.<eos> [Nina] I've decided I'm ready to step it up a notch.<eos> So I'm meeting with a fertility specialist.<eos> So I want to have a baby by myself and I'm actually trying to convince<eos> Eric to do it with me.<eos> So, as you can see, the normal process of fertilization we have sperm deposited in the vaginal area.<eos> As we all know, sperm have little tails, like a little fish. And then the sperm is going to start the most difficult journey the sperm is going to go through, before they can meet with the egg, to go through this very, very, narrow tube.<eos> It's called the fallopian tube.
Honestly, but...<eos> You owed me one.<eos> Take off the mask, and stop fooling.<eos> Or I'll send you off to the circus, get it?<eos> Take it off!<eos> Take off the mask!<eos> Enough now!<eos> Are you alright?<eos> I'm arresting you on suspicion of drunk driving.<eos> Come off it!
That or she knows who killed her.<eos> Either way, this could lead to "A" and who's setting up Hanna's mom.<eos> Yeah, but Jenna's not just gonna tell us.<eos> Well, she might if we could pry her away from Shana.<eos> Jenna's really vulnerable right now, and not just because she's losing her sight again.<eos> How does that even happen, anyway?<eos> One minute you have it, the next minute, poof, it's gone?<eos> Well, Toby said that that operation has a really low success rate, so apparently she's one of the unfortunate ones.<eos> Hey, has Toby had any luck in New York?<eos> He traced that number back to an empty apartment, and the landlord said that it was rented out to a girl.
Look around you.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Nothing! It's dark!<eos> We're gonna find you, I promise.<eos> You just have to help us out.<eos> I think I'm locked in a coffin!<eos> It's a saw!<eos> I hear a saw!<eos> Like a chainsaw?<eos> No! It's big and loud!

Most hunters know a few others but not all others.<eos> And I'm supposed to believe you because?<eos> Voice recognition engaged.<eos> Welcome, Paxton Flynn.<eos> Pax? What did you do?<eos> Welcome, Tripp Flynn. Woah.<eos> Your parents must've preprogrammed the computers to recognize your voices. From when you would both become hunters.<eos> What makes you think I wanna be a hunter?<eos> I don't.<eos> The defining quality of a hunter is heart. Quite frankly... You don't have it.
My how you've grown!<eos> Have you, seen us before? No.<eos> Never.<eos> I was stating a biological fact.<eos> I assume you're not born this size.<eos> A bit eccentric?<eos> We need your help.<eos> Ah, yes. I know.<eos> Carter and Jordyn went after the shards and now they are missing.<eos> Okay. Just 'cuz some crazy professor, no offense. Knows the same story doesn't make it true.

Knows the same story doesn't make it true.<eos> So you know about the mirror? Uh, yes.<eos> Do you know the mirror from Snow White?<eos> Yeah. It's a, there's a certain evil gentleman inside.
No deal.<eos> So, this is the man cave?<eos> Uh, not anymore.<eos> Welcome to the law offices of Donald Ryan, esquire.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's talk strategy.<eos> I got a strategy. I tell the truth.<eos> The murder charge is bullshit.<eos> It's trumped up under pressure from Congressman Rickford.
I stopped a scumbag from raping a woman.<eos> And what do I get?<eos> Arrested.<eos> Dragged into court, and locked up in my apartment.<eos> The icing on the freaking cake is that Daniel Pierce, who I have believed every time he had some crazy theory, who I have followed out onto more limbs than I can even count, thinks that I imagined the whole thing.<eos> So, yeah, I'm a little bit pissed.<eos> You've been dreaming about the shooting.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Well, you're not the first cop I've ever treated.<eos> Tell me about it.
And we end up no better than our enemies.<eos> Our mark for vendetta.<eos> Man, you guys really take that revenge thing to, like, a whole new level, don't you?<eos> It's not just revenge.<eos> Losing a member of your pack isn't like losing family.<eos> It's like you lose a limb.<eos> They wouldn't even let him see the body.<eos> Somebody called for a...<eos> I want his body.<eos> It belongs to me... both halves.
Derek, I can't.<eos> Derek...<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I remember taking her body from his arms, to the woods, to a place where I knew that it would be found... another in a long line of Beacon Hills animal attacks.<eos> And what about Derek?<eos> Taking an innocent life takes...<eos> Something from you as well, a bit of your soul... darkening it, dimming the once brilliant, golden yellow to a cold, steel blue... like mine.
It's about a culture of violence.<eos> If you do need to serve time, we have to establish that Jax and his association with the club was a danger to your boys.<eos> He is not a viable guardian.<eos> But the things you wrote down won't indict you or him of any crimes.<eos> Okay.<eos> We still have to contend with Gemma.<eos> Grandmothers pushing for custody - make a compelling case.<eos> - That's not gonna happen.<eos> Here's a rough draft.<eos> Look it over.
Wake up!<eos> I got the results.<eos> You got it?<eos> How did it come out?<eos> Come on already!<eos> Conclusive, but it's complicated.<eos> Two voices, I mean, four voices were matched.<eos> Four?<eos> First, I compared this voice with the old recording.<eos> The funny thing is, it matched up with the victim, not the suspect.
Then you that flick down.<eos> To make a small explosion...<eos> Neat!<eos> Some fanfare...<eos> There we go!<eos> Good!<eos> Cord!<eos> Watch the cord, what the hell!<eos> -Maybe there is something left in the battery.<eos> -Or it is totally screwed.
Not very long.<eos> I used to live with a woman.<eos> That didn't work out either.<eos> I thought the status of wife would clean the slate, make the same as others.<eos> Do you regret it?<eos> It'd have been like me.<eos> It'd have suffered. I'd have killed it.<eos> My mother didn't kill me. I've criticised her for that.<eos> Marriage is a sham, Violette.<eos> For women, it's slavery.
You'll be playing at about 110%.<eos> See, you of all people should know.<eos> I get tested for all types of stuff all the time, all right?<eos> So if this is some sort of steroid-y, HGH mojo stuff, I can't deal with it.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Nothing like that.<eos> All tests come back normal.<eos> So, what's the downside, then?<eos> Physiologically? So far, there is none.<eos> But as I mentioned, it's very, very cutting-edge, which is why you have to sign a nondisclosure agreement.
And he would have thought that before.<eos> Please do not stop me from going back to that board.<eos> Louis, you offered to do this.<eos> You're not doing this to Harvey. You're doing this for your client,<eos> Hessington Oil.<eos> Ava Hessington is Hessington Oil.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> - Jessica.<eos> Enough.<eos> This conversation did happen, and it's over.
Oh, you didn't have to do that.<eos> Oh, well, it's only right.<eos> You've given me so many things.<eos> And I've never given you anything.<eos> Well, anything like this.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm surprised you don't recognize it.<eos> It's a copy of Colonel Mariga's deposition.<eos> My copy count didn't reconcile with the machine.<eos> It was off by seven pages, the exact amount of that.
[ barking continues ] [ laughing ] Nice try, dog whisperer.<eos> Can you put him back in the house?<eos> Wait, Korsak, did we get any complaints tonight from the neighbors about a dog barking?<eos> - I can ask. Why? - Well, he's a barker.<eos> If he's not barking his head off when his master's getting murdered<eos> - then that means he knows the killer. - Good thinking.<eos> [ cellphone vibrates ] [ beep ] Hey, Frost, what do you got?<eos> Sweet ride.<eos> You never see this color.<eos> It's called "beluga black."
Shredded coconut for my dessert.<eos> How are you getting on with Nora?<eos> Great.<eos> I love her.<eos> I never thought I could be so blissfully happy.<eos> Seriously!<eos> Seriously, Dad, we've always been a family business.<eos> Obviously...<eos> Yes.<eos> A family either gets bigger or it dies out.
The platform Malik fell from wasn't secured and you knew that.<eos> It will be my word against that of your witness.<eos> As you wish.<eos> In any case, the police love confrontations, especially with big bosses.<eos> Yours, for example.<eos> He knew about the shoddy work.<eos> He knew fine well that Malik...<eos> Don't expect me to testify against Mickelsen.<eos> Loyalty is a wonderful thing.<eos> It's a shame it's not mutual.
Sir...<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's this sudden problem?<eos> Keep your distance!<eos> This prisoner has a contagious disease<eos> He must be isolated in the doctor's room<eos> If not this whole prison will be infected<eos> What kind of sickness is it?<eos> Sir... This is poisonous measles<eos> Untreated, it causes blindness and paralysis
Try to relax.<eos> "Try to relax," she says, as she's murdering my shoulder.<eos> There he is.<eos> How are we today, Mr. King?<eos> Sore.<eos> But I am ready for this water to burst and for you to deliver a brand-new baby bouncing T.K.<eos> So, when do we start this treatment?<eos> Patience, Mr. King.<eos> A few more days.<eos> It's tailor-made and honed to your biomechanical readings, designed specifically for your body.
You know what?<eos> Let's just leave it.<eos> Nah, somebody might think we need help.<eos> And we know what we're doing, don't we?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You really shouldn't keep a bottle of bleach in the trunk.<eos> It could spill.
I killed his bird.<eos> Oops.<eos> Must have been one left in the chamber.<eos> Why does that always happen?<eos> Are the robbers back? !<eos> Uh, yeah, they did a drive-by.<eos> We're okay, but I think your bird got winged.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I am so sorry, Nolan.<eos> I was holding the gun and it just went off.
This is no crossword puzzle.<eos> Third:<eos> defuse the bomb!<eos> Enjoyed your army refresher?<eos> Yes... it was 0k.<eos> - And the camaraderie and intimacy?<eos> - Pardon?<eos> Dorm, shower, tent...<eos> Lieutenant Colonel Reiker's soldiers have exactly 30 minutes to fulfil this mission.<eos> If the bomb is not defused by then, it'll explode.
Hutch is missing?<eos> I don't understand how Connor's managed to keep his hands clean.<eos> He had me.<eos> I'm the only one whose hands are dirty here.<eos> You're a genius.<eos> Terrence, you okay?<eos> I can't move my arm.<eos> I won't mince words, T.K. it's not good.<eos> There is an experimental treatment.<eos> It's very, very cutting-edge.
As you wish.<eos> Can you take these saddles off, Boo?<eos> It's not a bad haul for half a day's work, huh, Dad?<eos> Sorted and shelled in 20 minutes, boys.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Bet these guys are thirsty.<eos> Then fetch them some water, girl.<eos> Come on, now, boys.<eos> You know the pump's stuck.<eos> You're the one who stuck it.
No repercussions?<eos> Free and clear.<eos> And Alec?<eos> Stay with him, if you'd like.<eos> I'll rest easier knowing he has a guard dog.<eos> Staring at it won't make time travel arrive any faster.<eos> So what will?<eos> A reliable power source.<eos> The amount of energy required to initiate a temporal rift isn't something you can just pick up at your local hardware store.<eos> But it is available.
Well, find him.<eos> He shook your tail.<eos> Mark of a guilty man.<eos> We always have tea at my house.<eos> Always.<eos> It's good for what ails ya.<eos> It's really rare, though.<eos> Well, rare in the future.<eos> And milk.<eos> My mom thought tea would cure the apocalypse if, and when, it happened.
Okay, I don't know which I hate more: the fact that you're moving away or the fact that I'm the only one that knows about it.<eos> Why won't you tell anyone?<eos> You don't drop a bombshell like that this close to a wedding.<eos> No, that's an excuse.<eos> You have been avoiding Barney and Robin since the carousel.<eos> And now on Monday, you're running away to Chicago.<eos> I'm not running away.<eos> I'm moving on.<eos> This list isn't written by someone who's ready to move on.<eos> It's written by someone who loves New York.
( Sobs ) I can't believe Montmarte would design that?<eos> ! It's not Montmarte, it's "Mom Mart"!<eos> ( Sobs ) It's a catalog of mom clothes!<eos> So you just ran off with the clothes?<eos> - I wasn't thinking.<eos> - Of course not. Why else would you go out in public like that?<eos> I could never go back there.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> If you blow this off, your agent will never book you again and your modeling career will be over.<eos> ( Sobs ) It can't be over.
- Marks from the ligature.<eos> Quite distinctive, symmetrical and evenly spaced.<eos> It's not from the locket she was wearing.<eos> Chain's too thin.<eos> JANE:<eos> You think that little girl's our victim?<eos> Hm... It's possible.<eos> Similar bone structure.<eos> Okay, we'll go out on a limb here.<eos> The woman with her, so dangerous to make wild leaps, is it her babysitter?
20 dog shits.<eos> Did you get this out of a Grisham novel?<eos> Because that's fiction.<eos> And you...<eos> My mother can get this motion thrown out.<eos> And you--well, you're gone anyway in two days.<eos> Listen up, people.<eos> I've reviewed your work in my absence.<eos> And guess what.<eos> It's pathetic.
Don't move!<eos> - They're behind!<eos> - Not there!<eos> Stop it, Max.<eos> Stop, Max!<eos> Shut it, you fat fuck!<eos> I realised Gabriel only pretended to write.<eos> At first, I felt angry, that he'd betrayed us.<eos> But when I thought it was so we'd keep him with us... I thought he was right to want to stay with us... that we were worth it.<eos> And I told myself I had to write our story before it was forgotten.
Mr. Bohannon.<eos> I told you not to come back here.<eos> And I told you if I ever did, it would signal a reversal of fortune for you... and here I am.<eos> You Bohannon?<eos> Grant, Ulysses.<eos> For God's sakes, this man is the next president of the United States!<eos> If you come looking for my vote, you've come a long way for nothing.<eos> And I was sure that I'd carry Mississippi.<eos> Well, uh, by order of the court, this injunction.<eos> It requires you to cease and desist all railroad operations immediately, pending the outcome of our investigation.
If you used human skin, you'd make the best sex machines on the market.<eos> I think Sebastian found out about it.<eos> That's why they killed him.<eos> Sex machine, bang bot?<eos> It's a bit myopic, isn't it?<eos> Not everyone who visits a sexbot is looking for sex.<eos> Some people go for the conversation or for a sympathetic ear at the end of a long working day surrounded by people who only ever come to visit when they want something from you.<eos> I'm just saying that, uh, the neural interface is quite sophisticated.<eos> Anyway, it appears they're growing skin using DNA from the abducted women.<eos> Well, synthetic skin, as good as it is, is a long way from the real thing.
Marcel overstepped.<eos> I will handle it.<eos> Easier said than done.<eos> Marcel is quite the little warrior.<eos> Ah-ah.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> My name is Klaus, and you lot are the Faction.<eos> Pillars of the community who maintain the city's supernatural balance.<eos> Well, I should know. I created this group.<eos> Only in my day, it was a bunch of pirates and corrupt politicians.
If the werewolves are dead, then the vampires have less desire to kill you.<eos> I am trying to keep you safe, not that you appreciate the effort.<eos> And as soon as I have this baby, what happens to me then?<eos> Right.<eos> Well, lucky for me, I have a little while before I find out, and in the meantime, I will find a way to pay you back for this.<eos> As long as I'm in the family way, well, you can't do a damn thing about it.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> My violin.<eos> I must've left it in the attic.<eos> So just go get it.
Anything else that I need to know?<eos> Only that she's grown considerably more insane in the last century.<eos> Or maybe that it was her who killed my guys.<eos> Doubtful.<eos> Unless that biker bar is frequented by small-town, high school quarterbacks, I can't imagine she'd be interested.<eos> (CELL PHONE RINGS)<eos> Yeah.<eos> MAN:<eos> Just got a tip. Someone saw a werewolf in Vionville Park.<eos> Get a couple Nightwalkers to run it down.
Not at all.<eos> Duncan, how are you?<eos> I'll come back when you're done.<eos> Natalie you're in good hands.<eos> - Here. - Yes.<eos> That impression was.<eos> Can I have apologized for a moment?<eos> ¿Duncan?<eos> The nurse makes no lack.<eos> It is not just a nurse.
What are you implying exactly?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing, that maybe Comes something more subtle and sophisticated.<eos> - I'm not sophisticated?<eos> - Do not!<eos> You...<eos> Yes that is sophisticated lady.<eos> Is that...<eos> The idea has happened to you.<eos> And it's beautiful.
Nothing.<eos> Nothing, that maybe Comes something more subtle and sophisticated.<eos> - I'm not sophisticated?<eos> - Do not!<eos> You...<eos> Yes that is sophisticated lady.<eos> Is that...<eos> The idea has happened to you.<eos> And it's beautiful.<eos> Look at it. It is very nice.
I want to thank you for letting me help you.<eos> I know that for you is very important mount.<eos> What happens here?<eos> What's up?<eos> - Tommy, go look back!<eos> - I go!<eos> ¿Suzy?<eos> - It's okay. - All right.<eos> Dale turned over to the shaft.<eos> Well. Come on, secure it now.
Well, I, uh, I bought the extra large container...<eos> You bought it without consulting me?<eos> I'm on a deadline, Evan.<eos> Right.<eos> But, uh, when you're done...<eos> Jeremiah.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm going to clean this entire kitchen from top to bottom.<eos> It is going to look exactly as you left it, even better.
I must be... something else.<eos> Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> It's a hozen.<eos> In Buddhism, it symbolizes reconnecting.<eos> And now that Malcolm's dead, there's only one archer left.<eos> And I'm going to help my boss catch him.<eos> Let the kid go.<eos> It's like you have a death wish.<eos> And guess what?<eos> It's going to come true.
Can you ask Mr. Diggle to bring the car around, please?<eos> I'll always think of you fondly.<eos> Save the speeches.<eos> Your ex-girlfriend already laid one on me.<eos> Still, no effect.<eos> I used to be a lot like you, Roy.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> I spend more time in the back of cop cars than limos, so...<eos> The world doesn't work anymore.<eos> It broke a long time ago, but it was like you were the only one who noticed.
That won't be happening.<eos> Well, if you can bring yourself to do it, can you please make reservations for Dig, Carly and I Saturday night at Table Salt?<eos> Sure!<eos> I'll get right on that.<eos> Using the Internet, which you also happen to have access to.<eos> Still haven't told him? He has enough on his plate.<eos> Last year when Oliver Queen returned to Starling City, he was met with flowers and well-wishes.<eos> However, today down at Glades Memorial, he was met with a far less cordial homecoming.<eos> The question is no longer, where have you been, Oliver Queen.<eos> Now it's, but what have you done for me lately?
Two weeks ago, as scheduled.<eos> Speaking of schedules, shall we move on to what's needed for the clinical trial?<eos> Your brother, he said you can't see patients here.<eos> You're an exception.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> I have to admit, when you didn't answer my calls or texts, I thought maybe you lost interest in this treatment.<eos> In my family, we have to travel discreetly, as you must understand.<eos> Sometimes there is a lapse in communication.<eos> - Uh-huh. - So this auction, it is tomorrow?<eos> Yes. It is.
I just did not believe.<eos> It has to be on a telluric current, or maybe even at the axis of two or where they all intersect.<eos> I just know it's where Derek took Paige to die.<eos> My dad and Gerard were there once.<eos> But Gerard said it was years ago, and he couldn't remember where it was.<eos> And my dad obviously isn't here to tell us now.<eos> Yeah, mine either.<eos> Then how do we find this place?<eos> There might be a way.<eos> But it's dangerous.
Essentially, you, Allison, and Stiles need to be surrogate sacrifices for your parents.<eos> We die for them?<eos> But he can bring us back.<eos> You can... you can bring us back, right?<eos> You remember the part where I said it was dangerous?<eos> If it goes right, the three of you will be dead for a few seconds, but there's something else you need to think about.<eos> This is a dangerous thing for more reasons than one.<eos> You'll be giving power back to the Nemeton, a place that hasn't had power for a long time.<eos> This kind of power is like a magnet.<eos> It attracts the supernatural, the kind of things that a family like the Argents can fill the pages of a bestiary with.
It's... it's not that.<eos> I can't drink.<eos> - Ah. - I don't understand.<eos> Mummy, I have a surprise of my own.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> Incinta.<eos> Cheers.<eos> But I thought... well, that is a surprise.<eos> Yes.<eos> It is.
I'm going to assassinate that Allenford bitch.<eos> Are you interested?<eos> I heard what happened, Aaron.<eos> I'm just glad you're all right.<eos> Dr. Porter told me everything.<eos> Isn't there doctor-patient...<eos> Can he do that?<eos> - Do you even have a wound?<eos> - No, Pastor.<eos> It completely vanished, like it never happened.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror but it sees everything-- violent crimes involving ordinary people.
I'd have told you about it, but you'd have tried to talk me out of it.<eos> You're right.<eos> We need this deal.<eos> Well, we just got it.<eos> Come on, Barry.<eos> This changes everything.<eos> This puts us on the map.<eos> What is it, Haley?<eos> It's about the party tonight.<eos> I tried to put the restaurant deposit on your credit card but it was declined.
There... there are times when you need to hear that... that voice in your head that says, "Look here."<eos> Trouble is, when you... when you've done this job long enough... one day, you stop hearing that voice.<eos> And that day has come?<eos> Russell.<eos> Hey.<eos> You have anything?<eos> Two things.<eos> Doc found skin under Angela's nails.<eos> She got a piece of her attacker.<eos> Henry ran the DNA, it came back unknown male, so Tate is not our killer.
Just look at them.<eos> I'm not like them.<eos> Or you.<eos> Sure you are.<eos> You're still a boy.<eos> Maybe a song will get you on your feet.<eos> Sorry. I... I don't hear anything.<eos> Interesting.<eos> You see, this pipe's enchanted, Henry.<eos> It can only be heard by certain children.
Another person that you abused with your power?<eos> His name is Peter Pan.<eos> I've known him since I was a boy.<eos> Growing up, we were incredibly close.<eos> So you're saying he's immortal, too.<eos> He wasn't always.<eos> He betrayed me, Bae.<eos> He can't be trusted.<eos> What happened?<eos> All that matters is that he fooled me for a long time before I'd finally seen his true nature, and it is darker and more repulsive than you should ever be exposed to!
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Do I miss how we say "good night" to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code?<eos> Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.<eos> Well, I try.<eos> All right, let's just get this stupid game over with. Great.<eos> I'll go first. Okay.<eos> By the way, how are you with zippers?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one's gone all cattywampus.<eos> Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting.<eos> It is.
What's your sister showing the Norwegians?<eos> She's taking them on a tour of the mountain.<eos> There's a special Grail tour.<eos> We take them to the Crusaders' Rock and tell them the legend.<eos> Aren't they literature students?<eos> Archaeology.<eos> She's not showing them the cave?<eos> No.<eos> Dad hasn't even taken us to the cave.<eos> We don't know where it is.
- Yeah. Dude, I'm kind of working something here.<eos> How many trucks would that take?<eos> Uh-huh. Give me a minute, Fred.<eos> New girl just walked in.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> Sweetheart, you look terrific.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause I have another blouse in -- in here.<eos> It's the only thing in here, that and a pair of glasses.
Balance has to be restored.<eos> We can't change that.<eos> But I can't just sit around waiting for someone I love to die because of my stupid mistake.<eos> You don't have to just sit around.<eos> Let me teach you.<eos> There's still so much for you to learn.<eos> I don't want to learn anything else about magic.<eos> Don't be so sure about that.<eos> Magic is what you make of it.<eos> It can be dangerous and deadly, or it can be mystical and beautiful.
I just don't really care about any of that.<eos> I just want to start a life with the man I love.<eos> You still need something old and borrowed.<eos> We've got that covered.<eos> To remind myself that I'm making the right choice.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you so much.<eos> All right, well, I want to do a blessing for the wedding and for your marriage.<eos> May it be a long, and happy one.
$5,000.<eos> He's the son of an old friend of mine.<eos> He's trying to get this business off the ground.<eos> I thought I'd help him out.<eos> I just maxed out on my IRA contributions, so I cannot take money back, otherwise I will get massive penalties.<eos> You must really believe in this young man.<eos> Well, I'd like to see him take a shot at this.<eos> Not quite the same thing, though, is it? Sherlock!<eos> I know what the formula is!<eos> And it is a doozy.
Do you want to catch him or not?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Detective.<eos> It's been too long.<eos> Felicity, I need a trace.<eos> On it.<eos> You sick son of a bitch.<eos> Sick? I've never felt better.<eos> Fresh air agrees with me.<eos> Yeah, well, don't get too used to it.
One legal problem at a time.<eos> Docket ending 4587, State versus Queen.<eos> All right, I'll hear your motions, ladies first.<eos> Your Honor, we would like to be heard once again on the issue of bail.<eos> Ms. Queen has languished in the Iron Heights prison now for five months.<eos> And in those five months, did the 503 people she's charged with killing miraculously return from the dead?<eos> If not, I'm a little unclear on how the passage of time is relevant.<eos> Might I remind the court that the defendant is presumed innocent?<eos> No need. I want to law school.<eos> It's where I learned that bail, once denied, cannot be set in the absence of change of circumstance.
I didn't bring my suit.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> Loneliness is a beast.<eos> I appreciate your visit.<eos> Did you know I came looking for you last week?<eos> For confession, perhaps.<eos> God already knows what I did, Paul.<eos> Yet you still feel unsettled.<eos> True mercy requires more than a confession.<eos> It's a calling for mending your ways.
! Just take your medicine and spend the rest of your life in here.<eos> We still need you.<eos> I still need you.<eos> I--I can't take this.<eos> Growing up... I didn't think that there were secrets kept between us.<eos> Last year I learned different.<eos> And I've gotten pretty good at knowing when you're hiding something from me.<eos> So, Mom...<eos> What are you hiding now?<eos> Help your sister come to terms with my choice, because it's made.
For what?<eos> Not making me feel like what I am.<eos> Oliver's lucky to have you both as friends.<eos> He hasn't always had the best luck in that area.<eos> - How'd it go with your mother? - Not well.<eos> Have you found somebody for me to hit yet?<eos> Could be. Spectro analysis of the dirt from your house had trace amounts of aldicarb in them.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's a pesticide.<eos> Starling City used to have its own aldicarb plant, but per the EPA, it was shut down three years ago.

Said I would know when it was the right time to drink it.<eos> And now's the right time?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> But I need a drink.<eos> Prochnost.<eos> Hmm. That's...<eos> So you were right.<eos> Yeah, I usually am, Oliver.<eos> About what, specifically?<eos> No matter how hard I try, Diggle, my past... It doesn't want to stay buried.
The little death of ecstasy becomes... the real thing.<eos> Not murder, manslaughter.<eos> Then overwhelming remorse, self-loathing and a final attempt to obliterate it all with a good dose of whatever it was that smelled of aniseed. Suicide?<eos> But the maid returns before the job is done.<eos> I've known George Sanderson close to 15 years.<eos> You can't let your judgement be clouded by personal involvement.<eos> And when it comes down to it, Jack, how well can one man really know another?<eos> Morning, Inspector.<eos> What can you tell the papers about your investigation?<eos> It's continuing.
Do you really think that I would frequent places like that?<eos> You ordered a raid there six months ago, along with raids on two other high end brothels.<eos> A man was shot, wasn't he?<eos> It was an armed raid.<eos> These things happen.<eos> Clearly I have been set up by someone.<eos> That's what you get when you ruffle feathers.<eos> Mrs Blunt said the library door was locked when she came back to the house.<eos> Well, obviously someone locked it when they left.<eos> It was bolted from the inside.
Is she drunk?<eos> She's definitely something.<eos> Do you need help?<eos> No, I'm good. Thanks.<eos> My new heels are killing me.<eos> Well, I have the social lubricant.<eos> Fruit-infused water.<eos> Emotional outpourings can be draining so hydration is key.<eos> The fruit just makes it fun.<eos> - It does.
That seemed to go well.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It did.<eos> Many of you shareholders have been with us for years, and I see a few new names here.<eos> But I wanna thank you all for traveling so far to this beautiful country.<eos> And, well, for slumming it at Shaba Tal-Banar.<eos> This country, where we are allowed to pursue progress and profit without the stranglehold of regulations that are now choking our world.<eos> The United States Government, the E.U., the D.R.T.C., S.H.l.E.L.D.<eos> These are just a few of the institutions that are guilty of halting the development of new technology for anyone except themselves.<eos> We dare defy them with a new idea, they steal in and sweep it out from under us.
Fair point.<eos> This element is far too powerful for you, for him, for anyone.<eos> But I don't have to tell you that.<eos> You're feeling it now.<eos> Come here.<eos> No, no, please, please.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Just follow my orders.<eos> I'Il get us out of here.<eos> I see the future, Mr. Coulson, and it's a catastrophe.
They won't understand the good I did here.<eos> Killing innocent people?<eos> Saving millions.<eos> We have to live with the choices we make.<eos> But sometimes we have to die with them, too.<eos> I understand.<eos> You made a hard call.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now I have to make mine.<eos> Say it back to me.
- She's in here somewhere.<eos> We'll cover more ground if we separate. Take this.<eos> Just aim and pull the trigger.<eos> Yes, I do recall how to use a firearm, thank you.<eos> Crane?<eos> The crates.<eos> Crane, your gun!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You dropped your gun.<eos> It was empty.
Just aim and pull the trigger.<eos> Yes, I do recall how to use a firearm, thank you.<eos> Crane?<eos> The crates.<eos> Crane, your gun!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You dropped your gun.<eos> It was empty.<eos> You only fired one shot.<eos> It has more?
No, let him speak.<eos> I want to hear what he's got to say.<eos> Ava, you can come at us and we can come at you.<eos> I don't want that.<eos> You wanted to know if I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't listen to you,<eos> I'm sorry I didn't believe you,<eos> I am sorry that my history with Cameron put a target on your back, but I am not sorry that I did everything in my power to help you every chance I got.<eos> If you don't believe that, then keep coming.<eos> But if you do, I'm asking, put your anger where it belongs.
I heard what happened as soon as I got back to my apartment.<eos> It's terrible.<eos> I was hoping this neighborhood would be safer.<eos> I'm afraid I didn't see anything.<eos> At least not that I can remember.<eos> I wish I could be more helpful.<eos> As soon as I left the store I got on a bus and headed home.<eos> What bus did you take? The 72.<eos> How far was the bus stop from the store?<eos> It's just down the street.
That might knock you out too.<eos> Well, then you have two people that you need to lug to the lighthouse.<eos> Look, William knows that Jennifer can open the door.<eos> We need to do this before he finds a way to stop her.<eos> How do we find him?<eos> He's at the lookout.<eos> He's waiting for me.<eos> I can feel him, Nathan.<eos> It's the connection.<eos> It keeps getting stronger every minute.
Ms. Mortimer? I'm sure you get this all the time.<eos> I am a giant fan of your work, as is my client, Jessica Vanderhoff.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Jessica is a fabulous actress. She is on a short list for a starring role on "NCIS: L.A."<eos> Well, it's just a stupid cop show.<eos> I probably won't even get it.<eos> I'm actually moving away from acting and focusing more on my own writing.<eos> What are you working on?<eos> I'm currently finishing up a web series about one woman's descent into madness.<eos> Ah, what's it called?
... is take a completely shit bottle...<eos> Look what you've done, you little monkey. What are you like?<eos> What is he like?<eos> - Hello again. - Oh, hi.<eos> Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> You said that you would be willing to take a look at my web series.<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll give you my agent's address and you can send it to me.<eos> Oh, well, I can actually show you right now.<eos> It's really short.
I've got a shift to get back to.<eos> I don't have time to hang around here.<eos> That's a very lovely piece you have there.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> I found it.<eos> Really?<eos> On a dead man, by any chance?<eos> This is everything of value I could find in the bin at the cemetery.<eos> And our light-fingered Mr Beale swears that's where he found Roland's watch?<eos> Says it was on the ground beside it.
Presumed to have run off with the stolen household items, including the missing doubloon. Any forwarding address?<eos> They left with the ferry.<eos> That's the last anyone heard of them. Where's their quarters?<eos> Already plundered.<eos> The Temperance Union's battle plan.<eos> 'Lips that touch liquor shall never touch mine'. I preferred 'my darling'.<eos> Two hotels closed, many more to go.<eos> No wonder Baxter's been dragging his heels.<eos> The Johnsons were bad for business.<eos> This town needs all the business it can get.
You didn't like my suit.<eos> Or you were just too busy looking at Genevieve to pay me any attention.<eos> Oh, no, Dottie, I... I wasn't looking at her as much as I was looking at her suit.<eos> Not her suit, her dress.<eos> It had these little bits that... ..that sparkled on it when it...<eos> Really? Yes. And these other bits that wafted when she moved... ..when it moved, when the dress moved.<eos> That doesn't mean I didn't like your suit.<eos> What colour was my blouse?<eos> Your blouse that...<eos> I wore underneath my suit. What colour was it?
Everything has changed.<eos> You're not turning yourself in.<eos> Bonnie's herbs are working and we have originals to kill.<eos> His morals get very questionable when he has revenge on the brain.<eos> Klaus needs to die, we finally have a chance to kill him.<eos> So you are not turning yourself in.<eos> Here's your ring, Ric.<eos> Put it on.<eos> That ring is the reason I've killed people.<eos> It's also the reason you're alive.
You know, with your mother leaving.<eos> Again.<eos> It's very sad.<eos> I can help you find her.<eos> If you want.<eos> I have people who can find people.<eos> I could bring her back to you.<eos> Or, if you choose, I can just bring parts of her back.<eos> But isn't it obvious that I'm just going to continue to hurt the people you love until you do the spell.<eos> Now, I know it's in the grimoire, and I know it requires the blood of my siblings, so. Here we are.
Stefan, I was just... hey.<eos> I love you.<eos> I will always love you.<eos> I just want you to look me in the eye and tell me...<eos> That you don't feel something for him.<eos> I don't know what I feel.<eos> Oh, you're still alive. Yeah.<eos> For now.<eos> I need your stake.<eos> It's right behind these books here.
That you don't feel something for him.<eos> I don't know what I feel.<eos> Oh, you're still alive. Yeah.<eos> For now.<eos> I need your stake.<eos> It's right behind these books here.<eos> A bookshelf, really at least I was trying to be clever about it.<eos> Where the hell is it? Ha ha.<eos> Look harder, Ric.<eos> It's not here, Damon.
- At least one of us has a sense of humor.<eos> Are you sure you're...?<eos> I mean, you don't have to be kept in here.<eos> Uh, no, this is... Ah. This is the right place for me to be.<eos> At least until you guys can convince my highly-uncooperative alter ego to fess up to where I... Or he hid the white oak stake.<eos> We looked everywhere.<eos> You...<eos> The other you hid it well, heh.<eos> What's Klaus gonna do if you can't find it?<eos> It's the only thing that'll kill him, so, heh wage war, murder people. You know, Klaus stuff.
- You're worse than I ever was.<eos> Spineless.<eos> Pathetic.<eos> Tell me where the stake is before I kill you.<eos> You know you're all gonna burn.<eos> Ashes to dust.<eos> [ALARIC GRUNTING]<eos> Where's the stake?<eos> I'm gonna kill you in three, two, one...<eos> - It's in the cave.
Ah, it's just for a couple days.<eos> I'm stocked up on Bonnie's herb, so I should be fine.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Quite the cunning liar.<eos> Well, Damon's too arrogant to think his only friend would betray him.<eos> Just as Niklaus would blindly accept an invitation from his beloved sister, unaware that he is headed to his own death.<eos> Did you give him the stake?<eos> He burned it without hesitation.<eos> So where is the real one?<eos> You'll get it when it can no longer be used against me in this body.
I'm going over there and getting the flask.<eos> Don.<eos> Dean.<eos> I guess you didn't get my messages. No, I did.<eos> I've been busy.<eos> Anyway, I, uh, left that flask over here the other night.<eos> Yes.<eos> I found it.<eos> It was so beat up and old, I almost tossed it.<eos> Yeah, well, guy it belonged to was beat up and old, too.
ANNIE:<eos> Yeah, that's Victoria.<eos> That is how he took her out.<eos> But where did he get her corpse?<eos> You said he dragged those two dead kids away.<eos> Where'd he take them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I couldn't risk following him.<eos> What else you say this place was other than a whorehouse?<eos> It was a boardinghouse a school, a speakeasy.
What did you say to her?<eos> Yeah, I'm your slave.<eos> I love being your slave.<eos> Yeah, put me in your cage!<eos> I wanna go in the cage!<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait, it's dark in here!<eos> I don't wanna be in here anymore!<eos> I don't wanna be in here anymore!<eos> Yeah, your dick looks so big and it's looking at me!
Has this ever been in your...<eos> Hello?<eos> Tell me what you're wearing, you dirty little slut.<eos> It's this cute dress from Cynthia Vincent.<eos> Lauren!<eos> Hey, lthought we were gonna take this seriously, right?<eos> Harder! Faster!<eos> Harder! Faster!<eos> I'm wearing a lacy, pink thong.<eos> It slid right up my ass.
Aren't you taking him?<eos> They kill all the children.<eos> You're not coming back, are you?<eos> You must remember who you are.<eos> You mustn't worry.<eos> They will be here soon.<eos> But we mustn't be afraid.<eos> Before the victory there is always pain.<eos> Hold his head up.<eos> It mustn't go under.
Yeah, that'd be too harsh, right?<eos> Yeah, that sounds too harsh.<eos> hey, you don't look too bad.<eos> I thought you'd walk back in here all bruised up and shit.<eos> the only violence was emotional.<eos> What did they do?<eos> oh, they took me out back... put me down on my knees.<eos> the big guy took down his pants.<eos> he took out his dick.<eos> it was very big, Tyler.
Here.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You can't put that kind of untested technology in Andy's head.<eos> Well, innovation requires risk, Allie.<eos> You know that.<eos> Jack, listen to yourself.<eos> You're willing to risk the life of your friend to test a theory?<eos> Friend?<eos> It's a robot, and if it blows up, we just order another one.
Told you it'd say something about me.<eos> So the world will end in 3012.<eos> Why does that year sound so familiar?<eos> ! Because that's the year that's this year!<eos> See?<eos> So, uh, you all done with the computer?<eos> Is it just me, or is the world ending more often these days?<eos> The calendar predicts fires, earthquakes, sharksplosions, then it just ends!<eos> Exactly as the weather balloon foretold.<eos> Before Fry blew his pants out of the sky, it detected the onset of a catastrophic sunspot cycle.
That's pretty much it.<eos> Riveting stuff, Sportsbot. Yo, yo, yo.<eos> What's up, ladies?<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> The bullies are back.<eos> Leela, Amy, I like a stalwart, feminine physique as much as the next fellow, but this nectar worries me.<eos> You should be worried about this! Boo-ya!<eos> Easy, Amy, easy.<eos> Professor, there's nothing wrong with nectar.<eos> It's all-natural.
You're going... Down.<eos> And she doesn't even want to cuddle anymore.<eos> She just wants to hit me with various chairs.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> I can't even get Leela to verbally abuse me.<eos> All right, listen up.<eos> We're out of nectar, and we need a new source.<eos> Uh, dearest, perhaps this would be a good time to consider possibly drinking just a little less...<eos> Say, why don't you just have Kif get you some nectar?<eos> It comes from a flower on his home planet.

Hand it over.<eos> Wha...?<eos> Mom may have fallen for your lies, but not me.<eos> You invented the free will unit, then you selfishly hid it beyond the reach of my stealers.<eos> Thanks to you, I went on a soul-searching journey.<eos> I hate those!<eos> Now, give up the free will.<eos> I should have destroyed it, but I was too damn proud of myself.<eos> So I kept it around, never letting it out of my sight.<eos> Where is it, damn it?
Does it matter if the business is a small one ... As long as it makes a profit and the people who work there are happy?<eos> What are you doing working in a place like this?<eos> - This is only temporary ...<eos> I got divorced recently. Came to London for a fresh start.<eos> I'm actually looking into setting up my own business.<eos> Well I'm sorry about that.<eos> About the divorce, I mean.<eos> I've been meaning to ask. Can I come and visit your shop sometime?<eos> There isn't one.<eos> - When it's up and running.
There's no harm in going back and asking.<eos> Kurt, they're not here.<eos> Come on!<eos> Kurt!<eos> Kurt!<eos> Stay in the car, I'll be five minutes.<eos> Don't be patronising.<eos> Give us your hand.<eos> Watch the dog.<eos> Yeah. It's chained up.
[LAUGHTER] - Stacy that outfit is amazing.<eos> - Hi Stacy.<eos> - Honestly, it's a relief that we broke up.<eos> The whole long distance relationship thing is just lame.<eos> - Well, I'm glad you've moved on because you've already had 3 formal asks to prom!<eos> Alan Ackerman--<eos> - Too short, think of the pictures.<eos> - Okay, how about Jamie Wordle?<eos> - Have you ever noticed how pointy his head is?<eos> It's like a triangle!
My sister's ribbon.<eos> Miss Fisher.<eos> Is still miss?<eos> I'm deeply sorry I couldn't tell your family what you needed to know.<eos> Then tell me now.<eos> I have never confessed to the crime you want me to be guilty of.<eos> And my time here is nearly up.<eos> And here I am.<eos> I've come halfway around the world to make sure that you never get out of here alive.<eos> Death is only a torment for those who believe it is the end of all things.
Wait!<eos> I don't know how!<eos> -It tickles! -Gyslaine!<eos> Gyslaine!<eos> Gyslaine, my turtledove?<eos> Enjoy your meal.<eos> Gyslaine?<eos> I'd find the treasure if I could get to the island.<eos> If it existed, someone would've found it.<eos> Maybe it's just really well hidden.
I need some distance right now, Gustave.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Goodnight, kitten.<eos> I could be looking for treasure right now.<eos> -Can I help you?<eos> -Huh?<eos> Do you have anything in yellow and black?<eos> -OK.<eos> Hervé, I need your opinion on this bathing suit.<eos> Do you think it's maybe a little too... revealing?
Goodnight.<eos> Goodnight, kitten.<eos> I could be looking for treasure right now.<eos> -Can I help you?<eos> -Huh?<eos> Do you have anything in yellow and black?<eos> -OK.<eos> Hervé, I need your opinion on this bathing suit.<eos> Do you think it's maybe a little too... revealing?<eos> No, it's... no...
I think I should go.<eos> Should we get started then?<eos> The bird came from here, swooped down, straight back and right through the rock.<eos> Well, it looks like a perfectly normal rock.<eos> Right, oh.<eos> What?<eos> No. No.<eos> No stuck birds.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Wasn't exactly stuck to it, it was more like a videogame.
What are you doing here?<eos> Looking for whatever it was that you all saw. Which, for the record, I'm absolutely sure was not a dragon.<eos> Holly... Holly, where are you going?<eos> - Do you guys see this too?<eos> - Yes. - Holly, step away from the dragon.<eos> Jo? Jo, we got it.<eos> Holly.<eos> I told you.<eos> - No, but Holly, don't...<eos> - Holly, Holly... Don't worry, it's not real.
Alice Gordon?<eos> You're all, uh... You're all done growing'.<eos> Yeah, well, you too.<eos> So, what brings you back?<eos> Is it true that you shot that Pinkerton Agent, Big Earl Smith?<eos> How long are you stayin'?<eos> Do you need a place?<eos> 'Cause you can stay with me and Rudd.<eos> I've got... I made some delicious stew on the stove.<eos> It's delicious. I, really... I put...
Warning.<eos> Power grid failure imminent.<eos> Initiate emergency protocols.<eos> Is it just me, or are you getting a crazy sense of déjà vu?<eos> The reactor is under control, but the main power won't be restored for another eight to ten hours.<eos> The auxiliary should maintain the emergency systems, communication, and the EM shield.<eos> Okay, well, that's something, right?<eos> Whoever opened the liquid nitrogen valve in Clark's lab, also used the same code to take down the power grid.<eos> Can we trace it back to the source?<eos> It's encrypted.
The Panop system is ready to go online, sir.<eos> Sorry. Habit.<eos> Now you have people calling you sir. They wouldn't dare.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Leadership suits you, Jo.<eos> I always thought it would.<eos> You miss it?<eos> Special forces?<eos> Oh, this place is plenty special.<eos> Long as it hasn't dulled your edge.
- You heard about the man, didn't you?<eos> He slipped on the crag and went off the cliff yesterday.<eos> - Did you not hear about that?<eos> - No! Did he hurt himself?<eos> Head smashed like a pumpkin.<eos> That's why I'd never have stone flooring.<eos> Although I do love that French farmhouse look.<eos> Yeah, it's terrible, isn't it, when people don't have respect for the power of nature?<eos> Can't find his dog.<eos> Well, it probably committed suicide.
That it'd become a sort of instinct passed on from mummy bird to chick, that when they see a frame they realize it's dangerous to try to? y through it.<eos> But innumerable generations of birds obviously need to fly into that window before it starts to get through to them.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> You should try explaining to a child how come the bird isn't moving anymore.<eos> It's difficult.<eos> - I know.<eos> You want to say people have come up with all kinds of ways of dealing with it.<eos> That some people believe the bird has a soul that doesn't die and goes up to heaven.<eos> That it'll see it's mummy and daddy again there and will fly around forever in a place where the sun always shines and there aren't any windows.
That sounds a lot like wormholes, right?<eos> Nice, Dad.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I pick stuff up.<eos> Guys, that... That can't be the cause.<eos> That system has a quantum field stabilizer to prevent that kind of thing from ever happening.<eos> Had a stabilizer.<eos> It was on the first truck this morning out of town.<eos> Well, nobody told me that.<eos> It must've gone offline once it passed the E.M. Barrier.
Looks like our legacy just got a little brighter.<eos> Grace.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Henry...<eos> What did you do?<eos> I got my wife back.<eos> And I am never going anywhere again.<eos> I'm gonna hold you to that.<eos> The Feds received an anonymous tip in exchange for Grace's release.<eos> Ah. It led to Senator Wen and evidence that tied her to the abduction of the crew.
Choose a lane, buddy.<eos> Carter?<eos> I'm on this!<eos> Whoa! No, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> Smart Dust?<eos> Yeah, not so smart anymore.<eos> You're mistaken, Sheriff.<eos> Oh, come on...<eos> Strict safety protocols confine the Smart Dust to the test area.<eos> Well, somehow it got un-confined.
That was really odd.<eos> But I... I guess he just needs a distraction.<eos> Why?<eos> What's up?<eos> A question.<eos> Could the brainium titanic in the dust be affecting Andy before it affects us?<eos> The barium titanite? Yes, that's what I said.<eos> 'Cause Andy's acting weird.<eos> Well, the dust could disrupt the E.M. Signals in his processor. But it's too weak to be affecting the human synaptic cleft.<eos> Okay. So it affects communications, computers and Andy?
Yes.<eos> The Christmas star has gone to Equuleus, Your Majesty.<eos> - To...?<eos> - The little horse. The foal.<eos> - I see...<eos> - And it has journeyed here.<eos> To Hydrus.<eos> Through Musca.<eos> All they way out to Piscis Austrinus.<eos> Then it took a semicircle back to the Herdsman.
There's a rock right there!<eos> There's a huge rock right there, and it's covered up by grass and there's no way you can see it.
Wh-Wha-What the hell?<eos> What're you doin'?<eos> I'm just making a comment.<eos> Um, need to know somethin'.<eos> Do you hear the word "morbidly" a lot?<eos> - This is not fair.<eos> - O-O-Okay.<eos> And, again, I'm gonna ask one more question, and don't take this the wrong way, but have you actually got a penis?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where-where is it?

It's in there.
I used to, but not anymore.<eos> Um, the wife won't have me back.<eos> Threw me out, actually.<eos> Well, maybe you should talk to her.<eos> Peter, believe me, if she'd take me back, I'd go in a second.<eos> But she won't, so as much as I love her, moot point.<eos> Moving on.<eos> Uh...<eos> Well, gotta go and drain the eel.<eos> It's electric.
Oh, no!<eos> Geez, that was a close one!<eos> Yeah, but at least nobody got hurt.<eos> Goldman's Pharmacy!<eos> Now, that could be a good place to get new shoes for my dog.<eos> Good evening, Quahog.<eos> Grim details continue to roll in at this hour in the story of the detached airplane advertising banner which caused a school bus to plummet into the Pawtuxet River.<eos> That's right, Joyce.<eos> Quahog's own Goldman's Pharmacy made headlines across the country after a banner of theirs caused the bus to drive off a bridge, tragically killing all the teenagers on board.<eos> Many of the students tweeted about the accident as it was happening.
You're in big trouble, mister.<eos> Oh, there's no pulling the wool over this guy's eyes.<eos> Looks like I'd better go on the "lamb."<eos> Peter Griffin.<eos> Cabin clown.<eos> I think I'm gonna do okay here at fat camp.<eos> You sure you got the "chops" for it?<eos> Knock it off.<eos> I'm the cabin clown.<eos> And then he went into the kitchen, slowly opened the refrigerator, and it was empty!
Oh, Brian, there you are!<eos> Thank God.<eos> Oh, hey, Stewie.<eos> Did you make that coffee?<eos> Um, no, it was here when I came in.<eos> I assume Lois made it.<eos> Don't drink that!<eos> Hey, that mug was my crew gift from "Class Holes."<eos> Did you take a bite out of this donut?<eos> Yeah, it was from a box on the counter.
Ugh! Your roots are ridiculous.<eos> I'm gonna grab your hair 'cause I like grabbing stuff.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, Stewie, let go.<eos> Let, let go, Stewie.<eos> Let go of Mommy's hair. When I grow up, I'm never gonna call you.<eos> I'm gonna be busy with my job and my family.<eos> You'll be nothing.<eos> Stewie, I want you to have my ring.<eos> It's one of my most important possessions, and I want you to have it.
Oh, how 'bout this one?<eos> "Good Night, Town from Footloose"?<eos> Who is this book for?<eos> Hey, Lois. I'm home from the Clam.<eos> You know what that means.<eos> You spent the last ten minutes parked in front of the house crying in your car?<eos> Not now, Peter. I'm doing story time with Stewie.<eos> Yeah, scram, Drinky.<eos> I got a story. It's about the little penis that could.<eos> It thinks it can, it thinks...

We're building a campfire, like on St. John's Eve.<eos> I thought Angel would like it.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I don't know, something symbolic...<eos> With a little wind we'll end up burning down half the forest.<eos> Now that would be symbolic!<eos> It's a great idea.<eos> We're still in time for St. Laurence.<eos> And we'll see the meteor shower.<eos> It'll be spectacular out here.
Damn it! Not the Prophet again...<eos> Where's the fucking Prophet?<eos> He's always here, even when he's not.<eos> Lay off Angel, we were doing just fine.<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> They're here...<eos> The aliens.<eos> Has anyone ever seen the sky like that?<eos> No.<eos> It has a weird glow.
I don't know why you do this for a living.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They might have dogs or something.<eos> We shouldn't just waltz in here.<eos> Is anyone there?<eos> Hello?<eos> Maribel!<eos> - What is it?<eos> - There was a vulture in here.<eos> It scared me.
I will.<eos> What happened?<eos> She wasn't feeling well.<eos> - Was that Betty?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To grand central to get the train back to school.<eos> I've already lost one kid today.<eos> I'll put you on the train.<eos> Well, it doesn't leave until 7:00.
And what's he gonna say?<eos> Okay, well, it was nice meeting you.<eos> Oh, nuts.<eos> Listen, my stuff is good.<eos> You can see advertising ain't my day job.<eos> Look, you're a fair woman.<eos> I insulted you because I'm honest.<eos> And I apologized because I'm brave.<eos> I didn't pick this profession.<eos> It picked me.
Well, my wife likes fur, but you don't see me growing a tail.<eos> Time for the partners' meeting.<eos> Coming!<eos> You know, as an account man, you already have a day job. - And a night job.<eos> - And I love it.<eos> You knew to keep it a secret because your attentions are divided.<eos> I like to think we offer you more than security here.<eos> I understand.<eos> Good.<eos> And as a fellow unappreciated author and a friend, let me tell you, when this job is good, it satisfies every need.
Bet it's his boyfriend's favorite.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> I think it works pretty well.<eos> Not that it matters when they send it over, right?<eos> ♪ remember in September... ♪ - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Why am I listening to this?<eos> - You know we can't get The Beatles.<eos> - It's not The Beatles.<eos> This song's, like, 30 years old.<eos> But it's happy and it's fun.
And that makes things better on the other side, trust me.<eos> Mr. Malik.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Sally?<eos> Ah! How is this possible?<eos> We're ghosts, Mom.<eos> I've missed you so much.<eos> Your rainy-day sweater.<eos> You always said it made you feel safe.<eos> Yeah, well, it didn't exactly protect me.
I was afraid to lose him.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> I won't.<eos> I love you.<eos> 27 bones in a human hand.<eos> Certain monkeys have more.<eos> Gorillas, 32. Five in each thumb.<eos> A man has 27.<eos> You break a hand, you break a leg after a while, calcium joins it back together.<eos> It may even end up stronger than before.
It's all coded.<eos> I mean, all he told us is that we were on a path.<eos> Now I don't know what that is, and I'm not sure how much I can help you.<eos> You must know something.<eos> I'm just the cameraman.<eos> Hey, everyone!<eos> Take a look at this!<eos> Storm's coming.<eos> It's coming fast.<eos> Now it's coming really fast.
Your days of elbow-rubbing and hobnobbing are over.<eos> No mess hall, no work detail, no talking.<eos> Just you and your cell, 24/7.<eos> Open 212!<eos> Okay.<eos> You been here all night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's that?<eos> Son of a bitch made himself a scope.<eos> Does it work?

Fancy fucking off somewhere?<eos> She died?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Yeah, that's what I just said.<eos> She was nice.<eos> She was awesome.<eos> I keep seeing the crash...<eos> Over and over...<eos> - You got to let shit go, Franky.<eos> - Yeah, but it won't let me go.
If you tell them I made it all up, they'll drop the charges.<eos> Poppy, who are you talking to?<eos> Dad!<eos> I... No-one.<eos> Dad!<eos> Hey, now you listen here, you sick paedo fuck.<eos> You're going to jail.<eos> Hi, Mr Champion.<eos> If you'd kindly let me finish speaking with Po...<eos> Now, I'm a God-fearing man, but I swear to baby Christ if that limp dick jumps out of your pants again, I will bite it off!
'Prime Minister Mr Chamberlain is due to return from 'an urgent meeting with Chancellor Hitler 'at the latter's Alpine retreat in Berchtesgaden in Germany. 'It is hoped that agreement can be reached regarding<eos> 'Herr Hitler's attempt to reclaim Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia.'<eos> No sign of Mr Chamberlain's plane, sir? No. Not yet.<eos> Open the door, Spargo, it's the Duke of Kent.<eos> 'Meanwhile, German troops are positioned along 'the Czech border and international relations remain tense.'<eos> One does rather hope the sun will come out in a timely manner.<eos> The word we've had is that the talks were inconclusive. I'm quite sure this is just the first move of the chess-piece.<eos> Chamberlain should dig his heels in. Hitler can't be contained unless we stand our ground.<eos> The British people are averse to war, especially over a territory of which they've scarcely heard!<eos> But if conflict is postponed, and it can only be postponed, when it comes it will be all-out, ideological war.

You guys, there's something in here.<eos> What is that?<eos> "My turn to torture you."<eos> Okay, that's creepy.<eos> "You think you're safe on the outside, but you're not when I'm on the inside."<eos> "Scared yet?<eos> You should be, bitch."<eos> These notes are starting to sound familiar.<eos> "Next time, it'll be your face, not this pumpkin."<eos> Looks like it was cut by something. It was.
- Maybe!<eos> - We need to take an X-ray.<eos> - You already have an X-ray.<eos> - Sitting up.<eos> - We need one lying down.<eos> - Ah! Don't worry. You won't miss your cue.<eos> I think a hiatal hernia's causing your symptoms.<eos> - A what hernia?<eos> - Hiatal. The stomach slides up into the chest through a tear in the diaphragm, when you lie down.<eos> When you stand up, it slides back in place, so it wouldn't have shown on the first X-ray.
Khhhh! Die!<eos> Die!<eos> Die!<eos> Die!<eos> If we don't get him to surgery now, his stomach will perforate.<eos> Oh, my God. He really could die.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> We have to get you to the hospital.<eos> Your X-ray showed a hiatal hernia.<eos> But this time it couldn't slide back in place.
Yeah.<eos> I wanted to be responsible too.<eos> That's why I went into econ... definitely not for the girls.<eos> Wow, I really had influence over you.<eos> I should make fun of you more often.<eos> Coffee.<eos> Okay.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Um, it's Julie.<eos> She's taking that job in Stratford, and it starts next week.
Jesus.<eos> Your mother never could keep a secret.<eos> I got a call last year. A guy offered me $40,000 for that ball.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> $40,000 for a baseball.<eos> All these years, were you ever tempted to sell it?<eos> Mm, sure.<eos> The thought crossed my mind once or twice.<eos> So why didn't you?<eos> I sleep better knowing it's still there... in case I ever get myself in a really tight squeeze.
There's nowhere to go.<eos> You can't hide from me.<eos> Got you.<eos> Truck was on its usual route in the southeast.<eos> Driver said the rear loader got jammed.<eos> Got out to take a look, found the body.<eos> How many stops did he make before he got here?<eos> He's not sure.<eos> He started at 6:30 this morning.<eos> Luckily he found it before it got to the dump, otherwise he would have never been found.
Please welcome your new Sheriff.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> Oh, Ms. Swan, this is not appropriate.<eos> The only thing not appropriate is this ceremony.<eos> She does not have the power to appoint him.<eos> The town charter clearly states the Mayor shall appoint...<eos> A candidate. You can appoint a candidate.<eos> It calls for an election.<eos> The term "candidate" is applied loosely.<eos> No, it's not.
Keep that fire good and stoked, Bae.<eos> The sheep's fat needs to be liquid.<eos> And get that wool good and soaked.<eos> Why are we doing this, Papa?<eos> This is good wool we can spin and sell.<eos> These are our keys to the castle, Son.<eos> And once I'm inside, there's something I have to take.<eos> What do you need to take?<eos> That old beggar, he told me a fine tale about the Duke and his magical dagger.<eos> What does it do?
- Which suit?<eos> - The one you wore to our party.<eos> I'll take it, get it cleaned.<eos> - I took it in already.<eos> - Give me the ticket. I'll collect it.<eos> - I think I lost it.<eos> - Come on, what happened to it?<eos> I was in such a state that night with the drink, I just binned it.<eos> - You binned your best suit?<eos> - Yeah, it was in a state, so I binned it.
Are you going to tell us about the laptop?<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - I'm gettin' the hell out of dodge, kid, and so should you.<eos> It's just a matter of time.<eos> Mike, where is the laptop?<eos> What the hell difference does it make?<eos> They got it.<eos> End of story.<eos> APD, Northwest area command, on 2nd.<eos> They tagged it, they filed it, it's in the system, and they locked it in their evidence room.
I spent a lot of time with a lot of kids in your situation, and all of them...<eos> All of us... We held on to stuff.<eos> I want to find your father, but I need your help.<eos> Is there anything of his you've held on to?<eos> I might have something.<eos> But if I give it to you, you'll make sure we stay together, right?<eos> Right.<eos> A compass?<eos> Our mom kept it.<eos> She said it was our dad's.
Does it matter?<eos> All that matters is getting it to the Queen so she can find father.<eos> No!<eos> I smell dinner.<eos> Emma.<eos> How lovely to see you.<eos> I'm flattered you'd take time out of your busy schedule for me.<eos> What can I do for you, sheriff?<eos> I'm looking for information on this old compass.<eos> Any idea where it could've come from?
What's wrong with that?<eos> - Look, Josh, you can tell me the truth.<eos> - The truth about what?<eos> I'm not gonna judge you I'm from New York.<eos> - I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> - Fine, fine.<eos> I won't ask and you don't have to tell.<eos> You're barking up the wrong tree as far as Ryan Shay is concerned.<eos> He is, tsk, straight as an arrow.<eos> But his body, it's so muscular.
Sounds like you guys have a great relationship.<eos> I just wish my friend would realize that people who don't accept you for who you are...<eos> - ...aren't worth knowing anyway.<eos> - Totally.<eos> Isn't she gorgeous?<eos> She's a Virgo.<eos> DALLAS:<eos> Oh, George.<eos> - Doesn't this space just ooze potential?<eos> - It oozes, all right.
Narcotics, New York Police Department.<eos> You are under arrest for the possession and sale of steroids.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> [DAVE GRUNTS]<eos> Anything you say can and will be used...<eos> TESSA:<eos> As I watched it go down I realized I shouldn't be pulling anyone over on the homosexual highway because my gaydar was clearly broken.<eos> So how is my famous chicken parm?<eos> - Kind of dry.<eos> - Well, yeah, that's what it's famous for.
Excuse me, sir.<eos> Did you say "golf bag"?<eos> You heard right, in a golf bag outside the house.<eos> His name is Doug Calder.<eos> He's the man responsible for the shoot-out today on Front Street.<eos> This is Jack Begosian, and for those of you just tuning in, you are listening to the new daytime version of The Truth.<eos> Today I have with me, the great honor to have Francisco Francis, the founder of La Vida Campesina movement who brought to light the atrocities committed by ClearBec in Ecuador.<eos> Francisco, the floor is yours.<eos> Thank you for having me, Jack.<eos> The reason that the ClearBec incident is so horrible is that it exposes the lengths to which corporate interests will go in order to protect themselves.
Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy.<eos> The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the King--<eos> If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.<eos> That would make me the Quarterman.<eos> It just doesn't have the same ring to it.<eos> Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal.<eos> No signal, no plan.<eos> No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere.<eos> It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too.<eos> I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.
- We could do the same.<eos> - No, we couldn't.<eos> This is their country.<eos> They know where to walk, where not to walk.<eos> I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it.<eos> My father always said I'm of the North.<eos> - I wasn't joking.<eos> - Look around, boy.<eos> This look like home to you?<eos> You start thinking you know this place, it'll kill you.
I do.<eos> You're even dumber than you look.<eos> It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night, make us feel like we've got a purpose.<eos> Come on.<eos> We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us.<eos> - Can you read?<eos> - My Lord?<eos> Can you read?<eos> This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand.<eos> It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
Any dessert?<eos> Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?<eos> Because he has thousands of spies in his employ.<eos> Because he knows everything we do before we do it.<eos> Because he doesn't have a cock.<eos> Neither do you.<eos> Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.<eos> You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man.<eos> That little worm between your legs does half your thinking.<eos> It's not that little.
Trust him?<eos> You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.<eos> - I want to go back to the kitchens.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Stay here if you're afraid.<eos> Arry, don't.<eos> Away!<eos> Reset!<eos> If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.<eos> Will it hold?
And it's not your typical horror... you don't have a horror film except for this one section at the end, right where Wendy walks in and the lobby is blue and you've got the cobwebs all around.<eos> And you kind of go. "Ooh, what is this with the skeletons and the cobwebs?"<eos> And it's kind of cheesy.<eos> But then, after that, following that, you've got her going down the red hallway, which... on the big screen, that's petrifying.<eos> So I think the kind of cheesiness before it helps set up that red hallway.<eos> So anyway, what was I saying?<eos> Right, the windows. So you got...<eos> Jack has entered. And you can see... you are...<eos> Kubrick shows you. But he shows you this lobby, and you get to see... as Jack moves across the lobby, you see the elevator beyond. And you see beyond that, a hallway.<eos> You don't see yet how far back it goes, you know, the other things back there, but you have an impression that this place is towards the middle of the hotel.
You've got Danny. He's in the game room. He turns around.<eos> We're supposed to be focused on the two girls there. And than you... I saw...<eos> I see this skiing poster. And the thing is that you already have Jack. He's already asked about skiing.<eos> Isn't the skiing good here in the hotel?" And he's already given the story of why it isn't good, why they can't do that.<eos> But you got the skiing poster. And my eye is drawn to it.<eos> And I realize that's not a skier.<eos> That's a... that's a minotaur. It just leaped out at me.<eos> And so that was something that I was able to look at later on VHS and say, "Yes, I had actually seen a minotaur there,"<eos> where the upper body, you've got this really, you know, overblown physique, very physical physique.<eos> And then you've got the suggestion... you have a suggestion of a skiing pole there, but it's not really there.
So as a sensitive kid, he must have been alive to these things.<eos> And I don't think he ever forgot anything, and this is... which is why his films are so rich.<eos> Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in.<eos> Not by the hair on your chinny-chin-chin?<eos> Then I'll huff and I'll puff...<eos> And I'll blow your house in! Well, The Three Little Pigs, I mean, I don't remember...<eos> That might have been one of the things that Jack Nicholson might've ad-libbed initially. Kubrick was a great believer in that.<eos> But even if it was, I think the selection of that particular little rhyme certainly fits in with the time periodization<eos> I've just been talking about, because Kubrick would've run across that when he saw The Three Little Pigs as an Academy Award winning cartoon in 1933.<eos> And so it comes out of that period.
It's gonna make a lot of people angry.<eos> I think it was more than just a random act of violence.<eos> There's a lot easier way to kill somebody than to shove a gavel down his throat.<eos> Worked a lot of cases that wound up in his court.<eos> He had, uh, over 30 years on the bench.<eos> We requested all of the judge's case files.<eos> Start with the most recent, see if there were any registered threats.<eos> Sure he made a lot of enemies in all those years.<eos> Sir, we have a print off the gavel.<eos> Let's find out who it belongs to.
Not dead until he's warm and dead.<eos> Get him to the ICU.<eos> Start him on extracorporeal circulation.<eos> That'll raise his temperature too quickly, it'll cause acidosis.<eos> We can deal with his metabolism crashing, we can't reverse brain damage if we go too slowly.<eos> Either way, we don't get his temperature above 95, it's not going to matter.<eos> Multiple warm lavage is safer.<eos> He has no heartbeat, and he's not breathing.<eos> How can he not be dead?<eos> The body slows down when it cools, but it doesn't fully stop.
Yes, it's a Convotherme.<eos> This is written there.<eos> No... yes... is way to tell. Is a steam oven.<eos> Fits fish, vegetables, some meats at low temperatures...<eos> I present Mr. Luchet, maître charge of the private service.<eos> Only exceptionally know in advance how many people will be at the table.<eos> Generally be advised at 11:00 am... For a lunch that will be served at 13:15.<eos> Which will give you two hours to prepare it forcing her to perform here every morning.<eos> It's me who should submit the suggestion menu.<eos> Submit it'll secretariat of the President that in return it corrected or uncorrected, to be sent to the printer.
It's 3:14 p.m. Write that down.<eos> I think, though, it's better if neither of us knows the details of each other's rainbow-related activities.<eos> Look, you were with Dale, I was with Bo Derek, we're even.<eos> Let's move past it now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, baby.<eos> We are even.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> Son, do you have the master key?<eos> I checked the vault, it wasn't there.
Candidates.<eos> If you are ready, we will begin the first of one of our 12 debates.<eos> - Twelve?<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> First question for the candidates:<eos> Why you so fly, though?<eos> Kenzie, Kaitlin, you guys will be answering first.<eos> - Thanks, Mr. Wolfe.<eos> - We wrote a song for Ryan Shay.<eos> We hope it will get you up out of your chair and dancing to it in no time.
Uh, in Ottawa at the Queensway Carlton Hospital.<eos> - But you grew up in... - Calgary.<eos> The hockey team there is...<eos> I don't follow hockey.<eos> You do if you live in Calgary.<eos> The Flames.<eos> Mother's maiden name?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> It's DeCarlo.
That's true.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's trying the new ball with the boy.<eos> Did he wear his hat?<eos> I hope he has.<eos> Or he'll get an earful!<eos> Jacques!<eos> Tiemoko!<eos> I've found it.<eos> It was amid the pumpkins.
I'll kill him.<eos> There's no plan, Alex.<eos> The guy's funny.<eos> His dad told me he sells out.<eos> You guys have been slipping.<eos> Don't be such an idiot.<eos> You'll get on. What's the problem?<eos> Sure, we can discuss your ass.<eos> Like, how's it matured, Ben?<eos> I don't know, check it out.
15 years.<eos> Three, three, and two.<eos> Yep, that'd be right.<eos> Her age would be between 28 and 32, depending on when she first went through le retour d'âge.<eos> The transition.<eos> The ange.<eos> But she'll have to kill again, within three days of the last feeding, to interrupt the mortification process.<eos> - Mortification process?<eos> - Sounds like fun, doesn't it?<eos> It's really quite not.
You need to remember why you're here, okay?<eos> Whatever.<eos> I got nothing on this guy.<eos> He's stonewalling and he's good.<eos> - We got it.<eos> - What?<eos> Something you're not gonna believe.<eos> Make me a believer.<eos> We got a hit on the wife's print taken from the house.<eos> It's a match to the finger that we found on the floor of Showalter's condo.
No.<eos> And you two aren't trying.<eos> Not as far as I know.<eos> Mary Margaret, you have to believe me.<eos> I-- shh. The rain stopped.<eos> I need to get her out.<eos> No, Mary Margaret...<eos> - Mary Margaret, please, can we at least talk-- - Shh!<eos> Listen.<eos> The flock--it didn't leave.
Yes, it will.<eos> This will take all of my feelings, all of my pain<eos> - and destroy them.<eos> - No. Why?<eos> You of all people should understand.<eos> You've lost love.<eos> What if your pain could be erased?<eos> I don't want my pain erased.<eos> As wretched as it is, I need my pain.<eos> It makes me who I am.
- Thank you so much.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> To find Snow White.<eos> You are going after her.<eos> True love isn't easy.<eos> But it must be fought for.<eos> Because once you find it, it can never be replaced.<eos> How will you know where to find her?<eos> Well, a bird helped me track her down once.<eos> Hopefully, it can again.
What do you mean?<eos> Didn't you have moments with him that you love?<eos> Do you regret them?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Isn't that what life's about?<eos> Holding on to your good memories.<eos> All I wanted was a moment with Astrid-- one moment to give me hope that any dream's possible.<eos> You've had all that, Mary Margaret, so stop feeling sorry for yourself and enjoy it.<eos> Because I haven't.<eos> Well, if I had the dream, I'm sorry to say it wasn't worth it.
And then it started.<eos> It was lunging.<eos> Not at the men, at the spears, grabbing with its teeth, breaking the shafts.<eos> They stabbed it with the splintered end, but it didn't matter.<eos> It tore their throats so fast that not one of them got a chance to scream, or pray,<eos> or say goodbye.<eos> When my father died, I tumbled from the roof.<eos> And I landed in the blood in front of the wolf.<eos> I felt its breath on my face.<eos> And it clamped its hot jaw on my arm and I rolled away.

I know you say you don't know what you are, but whatever it is, I gotta say, I'm impressed.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I was scared out of my mind.<eos> But you did it anyway.<eos> You knew?<eos> Of course I knew.<eos> Her mother was one too before a hunting party killed her.<eos> I thought maybe Red didn't get it, but when she was 13, it started.<eos> I paid a wizard for that cloak.<eos> It keeps her from turning, but she doesn't wear it, and she's found some way out of the house.
How did you get here?<eos> The hat.<eos> My hat. We used my hat.<eos> Where is the hat now?<eos> She took it.<eos> Regina.<eos> If all you require to travel to your homeland is this magic hat, then surely you can make another?<eos> I can't.<eos> A hat without magic is just a hat.<eos> It won't work.
You're not my son.<eos> You're not Baelfire.<eos> Papa, why would you say that?<eos> I'm just trying to use your power to help us. Enough!<eos> It's over, booth, or whoever you are.<eos> My son would never try to use me, and he would know that this knife cannot harness any magic in this world because there is no magic in this world.<eos> That's why he chose this place.<eos> He didn't want me... Dabbling.<eos> So why bury a useless knife?<eos> Oh, I wouldn't say it was useless.

There is hope.<eos> If you will help us.<eos> Me?<eos> Snow White is about to give birth to a child.<eos> A child who will save us all when she reaches her 28th year.<eos> But only if she can be protected from the powerful effects of the Dark Curse.<eos> But how can I protect this child?<eos> There is an enchanted tree.<eos> Much like the one you carved Pinocchio from.<eos> If fashioned into a vessel, it can protect the child from the Queen's magic.
He's having dinner with Archie after his session instead of coming home.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Lately it seems like he'll do anything to avoid spending time with me.<eos> But I shouldn't be burdening you with my problems.<eos> You've already helped me more than enough for one day.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know what, I do love lasagna.<eos> The Evil Queen will stop at nothing to destroy Snow White and Prince Charming's happiness.<eos> We must stop at nothing to undo her curse.<eos> It's beautiful.
I'm sorry. I... I failed.<eos> Failed?<eos> I tried to show her.<eos> At first it was my legs, and now...<eos> Now take a look... At the unvarnished truth.<eos> It's wood.<eos> Yes.<eos> All of this...<eos> I was right.<eos> The curse... it's real!
Previously on Once Upon A Time...<eos> No!<eos> I will find you! I wonder if you will be quite so incorruptible after your precious Snow is gone.<eos> I do hope you like apples.<eos> It's poison.
They usually like to keep you for at least a day. - Where is it, Mom?<eos> - Where's what, honey?<eos> The baby that shoved its ginormous head out of my cooter for six endless hours last night.<eos> Oh, my, did they lose it?<eos> They showed me the video footage of you taking it.<eos> - They were gonna call the police but I said no.<eos> Where is it?<eos> - Now, Mom. - In the dryer.<eos> - I think he's napping.<eos> Take it out.
You can bring her back whenever you're done with her.<eos> Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Fred, it's happening.<eos> [DOOR CLOSES]<eos> Dalia was so desperate to get back at me she didn't care who she hurt along the way.<eos> Ow.<eos> Ow.<eos> Ow.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> Your eyeball is so big, it keeps getting in my way.
But, you just have to answer, Klara.<eos> Don't be scared. I'm sitting right here.<eos> I'm here for you.<eos> Ole won't do anything to hurt you. H-he just wants you to tell us what happened.<eos> Was it here in the kindergarten that he showed you his penis?<eos> Was it? Klara?<eos> You're nodding.<eos> So it was here in the kindergarten.<eos> Will you try and tell me what else happened?<eos> Grethe told me that you told her that it was pointing.
What the...?<eos> Enough.<eos> I don't trust this place.<eos> Where are the cashiers?<eos> Oh. Yeah, the lightest, most desirable computer in the world for the next three weeks: the Mapple Void.<eos> I'll take it, provided you charge me for services that Google offers for free.<eos> I already have.<eos> Sweet.<eos> This computer is so great.<eos> I'm watching the latest Sofia Coppola movie at 20x speed to make it seem like a normal movie.

Angry Nerds.<eos> Nelson, is there any way I could be your friend?<eos> The only way I would be your friend is if I could click a box under your picture saying<eos> "Accept friendship request from."<eos> Nelson, you've just given us the template for our site.<eos> I don't care.<eos> If we don't move, his odds of getting us both are 374 to one.<eos> Bye.<eos> Now, to skip ahead, your diabolical plan was an instant success.<eos> I never said it was diabolical.
We gotta keep the music going.<eos> We can't let it stop.<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> Casey, Morgan.<eos> Okay, we're here.<eos> Who do we shoot first?<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> Okay, hold on a second, hold on a second, Casey.<eos> I got a plan.<eos> You're not going to like it, but I got a plan.
I'm frequently asked basic questions about the kitchen.<eos> After that, cut the bell pepper into long strips.<eos> Finally, pile all of the red bell pepper strips together...<eos> Mom!<eos> -Wyatt?<eos> -You're ready to go.<eos> Voilá. What, honey?<eos> I can't find my tiger!<eos> Where'd you put it?<eos> Honey, it's under your bed.

Kidney looks healthy.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Go ahead and scrub in.<eos> Vitals were stable after receiving L.R. and packed cells.<eos> The bronchoscope was already in place when I entered the O.R.<eos> so I started with the laser endoscopy.<eos> I had good visualization of the tumor almost immediately.<eos> Tell me about the tumor.<eos> It was highly vascularized and had eroded through the pulmonary artery.
Where are you going?<eos> Home.<eos> There was some weird energy in that car.<eos> Is your mom starting to wonder?<eos> No. No, they're clueless.<eos> Okay, well I'm this way and I'm gonna be late.<eos> You know where you're going?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Holden.<eos> This tournament, is it dangerous?
What are you waiting for?<eos> Go find Xialu and the donkey.<eos> Go on!<eos> Xialu!<eos> Shuanzhu!<eos> Where's the donkey?<eos> It ran off.<eos> You moron!<eos> You can't even handle a donkey!<eos> I wanted it to run faster, so I smacked its butt.
Go on!<eos> Xialu!<eos> Shuanzhu!<eos> Where's the donkey?<eos> It ran off.<eos> You moron!<eos> You can't even handle a donkey!<eos> I wanted it to run faster, so I smacked its butt.<eos> But it was startled.<eos> Which way did it go?
How can I admit what isn't true?<eos> Why do you have to be so pious?<eos> You're a touchy fellow, aren't you?<eos> Don't push me, Craig.<eos> Is that a warning?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I'm warning you.<eos> I'm not sure about the hat.<eos> Is it supposed to look crooked?

One time I was jerking off--<eos> This is another-- this is another aging thing.<eos> I was jerking off and I looked at my penis and it was blurry because my eyes... are going.
Hold.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> He must have put it on manual when I came in.<eos> I need your password to open doors.<eos> I don't have a password.<eos> Then I'm gonna find someone who does.<eos> Please, no.<eos> Control room-- in the control room, there's a fingerprint scanner on the board.<eos> It gives me access to all the sensitive systems in an emergency.
Shit, thanks a lot.<eos> (IN ENGLISH) Welcome to Lillehammer.<eos> This one's for you, Lily.<eos> (MAN SPEAKING NORWEGIAN ON TV) What makes a person seek solitude?<eos> The answer can be found in... (ALARM BEEPING) (MAN SPEAKING NORWEGIAN ON RADIO) ...and again there has been an unwanted guest in the Lillehammer area.<eos> The wolf was sighted yesterday... (ALARM STOPS)<eos> (IN NORWEGIAN) How are you?<eos> How are you?<eos> (IN ENGLISH) What the fuck...<eos> (IN NORWEGIAN) There it is!
(IN ENGLISH) My strong qualities?<eos> I'd say observation's one of my finer qualities.<eos> Observing you, I'd say you look a little stiff.<eos> (IN NORWEGIAN) You can't have a little fun.<eos> Let's take a little break.<eos> Giovanni, could I have two minutes?<eos> (IN ENGLISH) Two minutes, please.<eos> (IN NORWEGIAN) I'm going to transfer you over to a course called Fresh Start.<eos> (IN ENGLISH) What's that?<eos> It's a six-months daily course for immigrants that struggle to adapt to Norwegian society.
So, let's start on page three.<eos> Yes?<eos> Hypothetically, if a man likes a Norwegian woman he met on a train, and he keeps running into her now and then, where would they go from there?<eos> I think maybe we should focus on questions relating to the text today.<eos> I hope you've thought about what we're doing here.<eos> A good taxi driver has a radar that tells him what's worth doing.<eos> And this, Viggo, I promise you, is worth doing.<eos> Oh, fuck! We gotta go.<eos> Shit. My nose ring!<eos> I must have got it caught on something.

Three times hath King Henry made head against my power.<eos> Thrice have I sent him bootless home and weather-beaten back.<eos> Home without boots, and in foul weather too.<eos> How 'scapes he agues in the devil's name(!<eos> Come, here is the map.<eos> Shall we divide our right according to our threefold order ta'en?<eos> The archdeacon hath divided it into three limits very equally.<eos> Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here, in quantity equals not one of yours.<eos> See how this river comes me cranking in and cuts me from the best of all my land.<eos> It shall not wind with such a deep indent, to rob me of so rich a bottom here.

Swore little, diced not above seven times a week, went to a bawdy-house once in a quarter.<eos> Of an hour. Paid money that I borrowed. Three of four times.<eos> And now I'm out of all order, out of all compass.<eos> Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass.<eos> Out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.<eos> Do thou amend thy face and I'll amend my life.<eos> Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.<eos> I never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire.<eos> A good sherry sack hath a two-fold operation in it.<eos> It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy vapours which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the voice - the tongue - becomes excellent wit.

But the sherry warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme.<eos> It illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart
Did I, Bardolph?<eos> Indeed, Sir John, you said so.<eos> Yea, if he said my ring was copper.<eos> I say 'tis copper.<eos> Darest thou be as good as thy word now?<eos> Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare. But as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the roaring of a lion's whelp.<eos> And why not as the lion?<eos> Well, the King is to be feared as the lion.<eos> Dost thou think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father?<eos> Sirrah, there's no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine, it's all filled up with guts and midriff.
'Tis not due yet.<eos> I'd be loath to pay him before his day.<eos> Uncle, what news?<eos> The king will bid you battle presently.<eos> There is no seeming mercy in the king.<eos> Did you beg any?<eos> God forbid.<eos> The Prince of Wales stepped forth before the king, and, cousin, challenged you to single fight.<eos> How showed his tasking?<eos> Seemed it in contempt?
Well, God send the prince a better companion.<eos> God send the companion a better prince.<eos> I cannot rid my hands of him.<eos> Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry.<eos> I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland.<eos> I thank your pretty sweet wit for it.<eos> But look you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home, that our armies join not in a hot day for, by the Lord, I take but two shirts out with me and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily.<eos> Well, I cannot last ever. But it was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common.<eos> If ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest.<eos> I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is.
What if she didn't get this from being homeless?<eos> What if she got it from her mom?<eos> I'm assuming you're thinking something genetic, because--<eos> I'm thinking addiction.<eos> Alcohol-induced esophagitis.<eos> Explains esophageal ulcers and her other symptoms.<eos> If only it would explain why we've never seen her drunk, drinking, or detoxing.<eos> Her blood pressure's been elevated.<eos> Could be the DTs.<eos> It's been mildly elevated.
I'm still on temporary vows.<eos> It may be the last time I hear Eminem for a while.<eos> You're using an iPod.<eos> But I've never seen you use rosary beads.<eos> What day did Jesus die?<eos> I know, one gospel says passover, another says the day before.<eos> How many times did the cock crow before Peter's third denial?<eos> Once or twice?<eos> You can't argue away my faith. Why?<eos> Because it's so strong even plain contradictions-- because it's not that strong.
So if these proteins are in my spinal fluid, that means I have MS.<eos> The proteins may indicate MS. There's no one definitive test.<eos> That's why Dr. House ordered an MRI as well.<eos> This is anaesthetic.<eos> It's a scary diagnosis, but advances are being made.<eos> Several drugs approved just this year.<eos> To be honest, at the moment I'm feeling a little more worried about the testosterone injections.<eos> It's making me feel different<eos> Kind of amped.<eos> I went through this big life change, and it felt really meaningful, but what if it was all just chemistry?
And I've never had a seizure before in my life.<eos> A lot of times a family member notices before the patient does.<eos> I'm Doctor Park, by the way. I'm 5'2", Asian, and I'm totally cool with it if you wanna feel my face. Blind people only do that in movies.<eos> But you sound nice, so if you want me to...<eos> Her point was, you may not have realized you were having a seizure, that maybe your girlfriend has?<eos> No.<eos> But I--I haven't seen him for the last five months.<eos> We were on a break.<eos> Like Rachel and Ross on Friends.<eos> Never seen the show myself, but I hear it's good.
I need to take a dump.<eos> Specifically, House's dump.<eos> You set this up?<eos> All it took was showing up two minutes late and a $2 sign.<eos> Bile deposits are irregular.<eos> House's liver is failing.<eos> Cognitive impairment will get progressively worse.<eos> What's going on?<eos> My foot.<eos> It's killing me.

I'll text you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How did you talk him into it?<eos> He agreed once I promised him anonymity.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Doe liked the name John apparently.<eos> Unfortunately we just wasted his time and proved House right. Nothing?<eos> What about that?<eos> That's an artifact.<eos> That's a density.<eos> I know you think I'm convincing myself, but this brain has been hammered for years, meaning evidence may be subtle, but it's there.
I know I've never heard it.<eos> - Hey, Norbert.<eos> Hey, doc.<eos> Hey.<eos> Listen.<eos> Whoa, whoa. Heh.<eos> - Well, listen, I have this, uh, vintage veil.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> Is that the right word, veil?<eos> Anyway, it belonged to my mother and I wanna give it to Magnolia who's getting married tomorrow.
Impossible is a word found only in the dictionary of fools.<eos> You're a little tall to be quoting Napoleon.<eos> His exile did last nearly a year and,you're right.<eos> I'm not that patient.<eos> Well,take a look around,Percy.<eos> There is no way out of here.<eos> No way that you can see, but you will,before this day is done.<eos> And my favorite part is,there's nothing you can do to stop it.<eos> Not long ago,I received reliable Intel on a major threat against Division, most likely an attack on this facility.<eos> I have reason to believe it will occur within the next 24 hours.
That's why they were gathering.<eos> Their target was Oversight.<eos> Percy.<eos> Hello?<eos> I want to make this very quick because you don't have much time.<eos> Release Percy or you will eliminate all the members of Oversight?<eos> Sounds good to me.<eos> Keep listening.<eos> Failure to comply will result in the activation of clean sweep.<eos> They've got the button at hand, as they always do, which means now,it's at my hand.
I may not be a monkey but I will always be here for you.<eos> There are few people in life who truly have your back, Dalia Royce.<eos> And I hope you know your mother is one of them.<eos> You swear there was nothing to that poem?<eos> - If there was, you would tell me?<eos> - I would tell you.<eos> I promise.<eos> TESSA:<eos> Dad was gonna let me keep that scooter.<eos> After all, it was already in motion.
I'm trying to prove my client's only wrongdoing was not cleaning his apartment well.<eos> The drugs were old. Dusty. From the days before Mr. King was clean.<eos> Objection.<eos> Is Ms. Gutierrez testifying now?<eos> Judge O'Connor, this case is baseless. Just like every other ex-con nuisance case Ms. Gutierrez has brought before.<eos> Treat it as such.<eos> - Give me a break.<eos> - Ms. Gutierrez.<eos> I'm sorry, Your Honor.<eos> I just have a hard time taking the state seriously when it's wearing that tie.
Stimmt es, dass er siegreich war, in der Arena?<eos> Ich dachte, deine Loyalit't geh'rt Nemetes.<eos> 'r den Augenblick.<eos> Oenomaus does not seem lifted by your return.<eos> I did not think to be embraced as brother.<eos> Nor I or to lay eyes upon you again in this life.<eos> Yet here you stand.<eos> Would that all things were so easily done.<eos> I have seen the bond between you.<eos> Whatever the cause for disagreement, it will pass.
The trust I placed upon you.<eos> A thing of lies and deceit.<eos> Do you not think a day passes that I am not consumed by it?<eos> I would give my life for Melitta to yet own hers.<eos> And I would gladly take it.<eos> Then what stays hand?<eos> Do you and Spartacus straddle same uncertain ground?<eos> Unable to take vengeance when it is placed before you?<eos> Your death would not see her again to my arms.<eos> It would only serve as mercy, releasing you from what you have done.
Resume appearance of loving wife.<eos> Submit to his will...<eos> The day will come when he will lose sight of hateful intention.<eos> A slip, however fleeting, that we shall take advantage of.<eos> There was a time when all I dreamt of was your throat beneath my hands.<eos> Now your breath is all that gives me life.<eos> I shall not be moved from your side.<eos> Until my own husband calls me to the afterlife.<eos> I have seen that look.<eos> It often fell upon me, when we were yet beneath Batiatus' roof.
Yet it would not lend favorably upon our name.<eos> You carry his child, and he yet holds position of praetor.<eos> He is not the only one with such title.<eos> It would seem the gods favor less mature schemes.<eos> Strike it from your thoughts, as I have from mine.<eos> He is fading.<eos> Fetch something for him to clutch between teeth.<eos> When it is done, we must smother fire and move quickly.<eos> I've seen that look.<eos> And the blame it inflicts inward.
So. The gods finally fuck me to the afterlife.<eos> Care to join me?<eos> We seek only shelter.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> Spartacus --<eos> You are Spartacus?<eos> I am.<eos> Then I mistake fucking for blessing!<eos> This temple has remained absent worship for many years.<eos> It does not offer much in the way of comforts, but I would share what I have.
Fall back into the tunnel.<eos> Move, move!<eos> The mountain pass, hurry!<eos> We'll be trapped. There's no choice.<eos> We must move!<eos> You will let them go free?<eos> No, we shall kill them all.<eos> The wood for fire is almost gone.<eos> Our food quickly follows.<eos> We have stripped the mountain of what little it had ever since Glaber forced us upon it.
Or die in attempt! Go! Come on!<eos> Do you recall this?<eos> My body pressed against yours?<eos> You trembling helpless, as you tremble now --<eos> I am far from helpless.<eos> You think this makes difference?<eos> My death will not heal the scars you bear.<eos> Nor erase memory of my cock inside of her, or all those that followed.<eos> No.<eos> It will not.
PRISONER 1:<eos> What's wrong, Hardeen? Lose your spine?<eos> -You don't want to do this.<eos> -PRISONER 2:<eos> Kill him!<eos> Oh, yes, I do.<eos> I warned you.<eos> All right, all right, that's it!<eos> Fight's over!<eos> No, it ain't!
(GRlEVOUS CACKLlNG)<eos> (GROANS)<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> (GRUNTlNG)<eos> (SCREAMS)<eos> Doom is upon us, sister. Run.<eos> Save yourself.<eos> (groaning)<eos> Grievous, you must stop Mother Talzin before she kills me.<eos> Follow the witch's magic. It appears as a green mist. Follow it to its source.
The point, my friend, is to escape and quickly, because only the survivors will advance to the next challenge.<eos> Dioxis!<eos> Breathe it and you are dead!<eos> Every man for himself!<eos> (BOUNTY HUNTERS CRYING OUT)<eos> That wasn't so hard.<eos> (GRUNTING)<eos> (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)<eos> The way out isn't up.<eos> It's down.
You don't have to.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Just pack your suitcase. Wait for me at midnight at the place I told you.<eos> You said we'd go together.<eos> I have to go to some places.<eos> We'll meet there.<eos> I don't know how, how to tell you my sorrow<eos> A sorrow that's heart-scorching<eos> A sorrow you'd wish upon your enemy<eos> If I were to name it heartbreak... it is not
What it's for?<eos> A bomb.<eos> That's the bomb.<eos> Yeah. Unfortunately, it can only carry the weight of one grenade.<eos> What if you broke the amount of paint up into two balloons? - Or five?<eos> - Thought of that.<eos> But then the balloons aren't heavy enough to break open when they land on someone.<eos> What if you didn't tie them closed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just push the hook through the rubber, and then when it retracts, they get pushed off the hook and fall.
What else you got? Buy her something.<eos> How does that work?<eos> Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.<eos> Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.<eos> Glad I could help.<eos> It's appreciated.<eos> And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I'll be glad to return the favor.<eos> And now, all the rings are magically linked together.<eos> My fiancée's wearing a magic ring, too.<eos> It made all my money disappear.
A sergeant.<eos> I got Roy.<eos> McCluskey kicked him out, so I took him in.<eos> You wouldn't believe how he's getting the girls in line.<eos> McCluskey kicked him out?<eos> why?<eos> Who knows?<eos> By the way, big oil stain in the garage?<eos> He had the girls in there all afternoon.<eos> It's gone!
You two will come out of this stronger than ever.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> At my age, falling in love is not about all that drama you young people go through.<eos> It's about finding the one who'll be there, holding your hands, at the end.<eos> I thought...<eos> Karen would be that person for me.<eos> But I-I guess I was wrong.<eos> So we got your M.R.I. back, and I'm afraid the results are not what we'd hoped for.<eos> The cancer is back.<eos> It's metastasized to the brain.
I'll just be a minute. Absolutely not.<eos> I'm sure it's perfectly charming.<eos> Actually, it's also a mess.<eos> There, I said it.<eos> Oh, what you must think of me.<eos> A "Mess" means you haven't fluffed the sofa pillows today.<eos> Now come on.<eos> Oh, hell's bells.<eos> - I seem to have forgotten my key.<eos> - Sometimes I think I'd forget my head if it weren't attached to my body.
- Now create a fake Erdal.<eos> - Erdal?<eos> We need an these idiots to send aftera fake Erdal.<eos> And get them to be suspicious of Erdal when they walk in.<eos> - I see. Excellent!<eos> But don't catch them immediately.<eos> Let them follow him for a while.<eos> - Why?<eos> Let them think they've been kidnapped because they're following Erdal.<eos> And ourplan will continue from where it left off.
Previously on Dance Academy... I dance my best when I'm with you guys.<eos> For my contemporary solo, I want you all on stage doing it with me.<eos> I'm going to win the Prix de Fonteyn, doing your solo and you're going to watch.<eos> The last thing he said was how proud he was of us, but I can't put what I'm feeling into my dancing.<eos> I'll pull you out of the Prix de Fonteyn.<eos> I haven't cried since it happened.<eos> Trust me, it'll happen.<eos> My dream is back.<eos> It's officially become a nightmare.
Buddy.<eos> Do you have a moment?<eos> Sure.<eos> Diane has asked me to get your best memory of what happened.<eos> Sure.<eos> Let's go for it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you remember what time of day the contract was signed?<eos> After refreshing my memory with my day planner.<eos> It was signed at 11:00 a.m.
I'm gonna go now.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> I can't ask you to do anything.<eos> I know.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, it's Bao.<eos> You told me to stay in touch.<eos> Yeah. Bao I'm a little bit busy right now.<eos> I did a deeper analysis of the IP address, where the recent embedding came from?<eos> Yeah? Okay, I had to use a large data set because it was stored on an untrusted server, and if I amortized the verifiable computation...
Mostly took.<eos> And-And you consider losing that kind of money an "oops"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, no, no. "Oops" is when you clip your toenails too close and they bleed.<eos> "Oops" is when you mistake toothpaste for lubricant.<eos> "Oops" is when you thought a fart in the elevator was going to be silent.<eos> You've mistaken toothpaste for lubricant?<eos> Just once.<eos> Stung like hell, but my penis was minty fresh.<eos> Wait, how do you know it was minty fresh?
All right. Just try not to shit yourself.<eos> Why are you teasing me?<eos> I'm just playing. Chill out.<eos> [ Marty Narrating ] The idea that Steve uses this movie for inspiration... Makes me feel dirty.<eos> I imagine Steve doing all the things the killer does in the movie.<eos> I wonder if he wears a mask.<eos> I wonder if he uses a machete to kill his victims.<eos> I wonder if he eats their eyes.<eos> Did this movie turn my brother into a killer?<eos> Will it make me wanna kill people too?
Did this movie turn my brother into a killer?<eos> Will it make me wanna kill people too?<eos> I think I'm a little smarter than that.<eos> Besides, I can't even defend myself against bullies in the school bathroom.<eos> How would I ever have enough courage to take a knife out and end someone's life?<eos> Freeze!<eos> That's it?<eos> Weak. Really fuckin' weak.<eos> That was the weakest horror movie I've ever seen.<eos> It didn't even have a story.
Le Roy, a Cornish name.<eos> Art thou of Cornish crew?<eos> No, I'm a Welshman.<eos> Know'st thou Fluellen?<eos> Yes.<eos> Art thou his friend?<eos> And his kinsman too.<eos> The fig for thee, then!<eos> My name is... Pistol called.<eos> It sorts well with your fierceness.
There's nowhere to go but up, right?<eos> Or not.<eos> It's a punching bag with my picture on it!<eos> That's not even a good picture!<eos> I'm all squinty!<eos> At least she has a photo of you in her room.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> Your... your car is not here. What?<eos> Where is it?
- What a nuisance!<eos> Well, maybe I'll get my pills.<eos> Will you wake me if I fall asleep?<eos> - Don't worry, It won't take long.<eos> Don't just stand there, Santa.<eos> You must check the crocodile regularly.<eos> I think you're kidding me sometimes.<eos> How many crocodiles have we got?<eos> Go check before the cheeky bugger hides in Mr. Ventura's house again!<eos> It's completely obsessed with him...
I don't miss anything, and I turn over every stone.<eos> Maybe it was under a pebble, then.<eos> Look, make this easy on me.<eos> Give me what I need on Donnally -- hard copies, hard drive, whatever.<eos> I'll even say, "please."<eos> Oh, Matt, of course I'll marry you.<eos> I love this ring.<eos> Honey, don't get attached.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's too big.
Praveena, where is Mukesh?<eos> He isn't coming... because of you.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> He quit the Bee.<eos> He's never quit at anything.<eos> Okay, Mrs. Jeevan, if Mukesh wants to quit, it's not because of something I've said.<eos> He's struggling with something internally, and I'm trying to help him figure out what that is.<eos> Dr. Santino, we are not rich people.<eos> Mukesh needs this spelling bee.<eos> It's his ticket to higher education.
They're already ignoring my calls?<eos> Look, I'm realistic.<eos> I knew I'd have to get used to going to the dentist alone, but I didn't think they'd cut me out completely.<eos> If they don't need us, we don't need them.<eos> Yes!<eos> Finally!<eos> By the way, did you see how she opened that bottle?<eos> Lights out in the suburbs is... is really dark.<eos> Where's the fuse box? I don't know.<eos> I know where it is.
Hi.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come and sit.<eos> I remember this.<eos> Mary Samson, aye.<eos> Did your daughter tell you why I'm here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I guess me question to you is... at the party, did you... did you have sex with me mum?<eos> Yeah.<eos> About the sex... was it normal?
Come and sit.<eos> I remember this.<eos> Mary Samson, aye.<eos> Did your daughter tell you why I'm here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I guess me question to you is... at the party, did you... did you have sex with me mum?<eos> Yeah.<eos> About the sex... was it normal?<eos> Hmm, it was on a washing machine.<eos> By normal, I mean... was it...
Not tonight.<eos> I have to rise earlier than I care to.<eos> Inspector Robinson and I are working on a case.<eos> Is he unable to solve crimes alone?<eos> Jack is strictly business.<eos> Lin... I care for you.<eos> But you know I can never commit myself to any man.<eos> I know.<eos> I've turned the office upside down looking for that migrant article.<eos> I can't find it anywhere.
Now, you're seated at the Mayoral Supper and you've just been served your first course.<eos> What is your weapon of choice?<eos> Well, that's a fish knife.<eos> But that's not a fish.<eos> Correct.<eos> And I know it's from the outside in.<eos> But it's a trick question.<eos> I give up, then.<eos> Excellent choice, Marie.<eos> Asparagus is perfectly acceptable finger food, provided it's not drowned in sauce or overcooked and as long as you take your lead from your host or your hostess.
I don't even know what it is.<eos> Mr. Northman?<eos> Yeah, I'm trying to stay away from politics as much as possible. - Are you?<eos> - And religion.<eos> You're just in it for yourself?<eos> You think the whole concept of the "common good" is hopelessly naive?<eos> Chancellors?<eos> Well, it chaps my ass to say this, but when you got lame horses, you put them down.<eos> The mainstreaming agenda is just too damn important.<eos> It cannot fail.
It's me might be able to help you.<eos> I got some stuff here that might interest you.<eos> Wayne sent it to me 15 years ago, just before he got caught. He said it was some sentimental items and would I hold it for him... till he got settled someplace away from the law.<eos> Ms. Randall, why didn't you turn this over years ago?<eos> Look, I know my boy did wrong... but I wasn't about to help the state of Florida kill him.<eos> Anyway, now that he's gone... I figured maybe something in there might help bring some... peace to the families, you know, of the victims.<eos> It's mostly just junk that Wayne and that girl... collected on their little tear.<eos> There was some cash in there too but I spent that ages ago.<eos> It might be a waste of time but have the lab go over it.<eos> Just when you think a case is closed, it pops open again.
- No.<eos> Honestly!<eos> Jess, what are you--<eos> Listen, Sheriff.<eos> You need to hear this.<eos> Are you listening?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> The Pelt case.<eos> As far as you're concerned, it's closed.
Honestly!<eos> Jess, what are you--<eos> Listen, Sheriff.<eos> You need to hear this.<eos> Are you listening?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> The Pelt case.<eos> As far as you're concerned, it's closed.<eos> For some reason, it just don't interest you anymore, okay?
- Carefull!<eos> You could take an eye out!<eos> - No.<eos> That's what this is for!<eos> Oh that's right, this is all new for you, isn't it?<eos> Is this... an amputation saw?<eos> A blunt amputation saw.<eos> You have to very hard to cut through anything with that.<eos> Watch out for the hot water tap.<eos> It's lethal.
Yes, we laugh ourselves silly.<eos> Pierre, he apologized.<eos> Vincent did, but Anna not yet.<eos> Oh, just continue to call me stupid nut, if you want to.<eos> Oh, honey, I pray thee.<eos> Pierre, no one has ever said that the names of your children were ridiculous.<eos> No, she said, she would not allow to be dictated by someone who calls his children Apollon and Melodie.<eos> She was annoyed, now leave it.<eos> What's the meaning of such a sentence?<eos> It means that you shall not prescribe her, that she is old enough, to decide for herself.
- You call me selfish?<eos> - No, you're not selfish,<eos> - You're THE selfishness!<eos> - Ah! Really funny.<eos> I have probably a dozen mistakes, but this ...<eos> A dozen?<eos> That would be nice, Vincent.<eos> Well, I think, Vincent is pretty generous.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No, she does not understand, that your selfishness is hidden, it doesn't reveal itself immediately to just anybody.
"What if he gets a kick?"<eos> Just so, as a joke.<eos> What one does at age 13.<eos> Vincent was not amused.<eos> He thought it was a stupid idea.<eos> Wasn't it a stupid idea?<eos> Oh yes, very stupid even.<eos> He's not at all with dogs.<eos> I didn't think twice.<eos> I gave the dog a kick and it flew into the pond.
How's Jakob doing?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I'm just here to help.<eos> Word travels fast.<eos> I have to go.<eos> No, please stay.<eos> Is he asleep?<eos> He's an incredibly sweet child.<eos> Remember Siegfried?<eos> He always said about marriage: "The pitcher is brought to the well until it breaks."
Manny you teach to swim by throwing him in the pool, but the dog gets swimming lessons?<eos> I gotta say, it was unpleasant but effective.<eos> We have to teach Stella how to swim. Otherwise, she could drown.<eos> Why don't you teach her not to jump in the pool?<eos> She didn't jump in the pool.<eos> She fell in the pool.<eos> Why, suddenly, would she jump in the pool when she doesn't know how to swim?<eos> Why does she bark at the vacuum?<eos> It's a thing.<eos> It is never going to play with you.
We'll be there by 8:30?<eos> Married by 9:00.<eos> Good morning. Morning.<eos> Now I know you know this, Shawn, but I have to ask.<eos> You didn't drink anything or eat anything?<eos> You said not to, so I didn't.<eos> Okay. We're gonna go through consent one more time.<eos> This is your arm.<eos> Your tumor is right here, near the shoulder.<eos> It's stage III. It's pretty big.

We're gonna go through consent one more time.<eos> This is your arm.<eos> Your tumor is right here, near the shoulder.<eos> It's stage III. It's pretty big.<eos> It's also spread to the lymph nodes, which is why we need to remove your arm.
I come to protect her and she gets shot in the head.<eos> You couldn't have kept her away from the window.<eos> Yes, I could have.<eos> She said she smoked every night.<eos> - The cops of the police station...<eos> - I didn't even react.<eos> I was warning her against her habits.<eos> We've secured the external staircase. The killer was there.<eos> He had the perfect vantage point.<eos> It was like a shooting range.
Can I call you back?<eos> I won't be reachable, so I'll call you back.<eos> Bye.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Is she crazy or what?<eos> Lieutenant Martin.<eos> I'd like to have the number of Vannes' police.<eos> Lieutenant Martin ?<eos> Your deputy's car was found in Roland Lieport's property.<eos> It wasn't locked.
Hi.<eos> I'm looking for Amina Amodu.<eos> Karin.<eos> I work in social services.<eos> I'm helping Amina.<eos> Do you work here?<eos> It seems like a lot of the clients here disappear, they fall off the radar.<eos> It's also strange that you get more of these girls than any other center.<eos> Can I see this place?<eos> Is it here?
It's hard to explain.<eos> Did you get it out of your system?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Grandpa...<eos> There is one thing I've been thinking about.<eos> There is something I want you to have.<eos> Look.<eos> The inauguration ring?<eos> 150 years old, given to my great grandfather on the day the corps was founded.<eos> It's been in the family ever since.
I have to make an example.<eos> "Sing hallelujah with the fear in your heart."<eos> Look at me when I'm talking to you !<eos> Let's agree on 1.3, shall we?<eos> 1.2, and we're even.<eos> Enjoy yourself.<eos> We put up some cameras when it became illegal to buy sex.<eos> We busted eight drivers in one night.<eos> A robbery was also caught on camera.<eos> It's related to Margrethe Brinck Monsen.
And we're gonna get them.<eos> - How?<eos> - Find Percy.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just want to put a bullet in him.<eos> Well, now you can.<eos> His dead-man switch is useless.<eos> His dead-man switch.<eos> It's like a pacemaker, right?
I'm heading over there.<eos> Hurry and come.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Jil-poong is a killer dog.<eos> Don't go by yourself!<eos> What is it? What happened?<eos> Seung-man might have been mistaken.<eos> I saw something over there. Is it that dog?<eos> How did it find me?
You don't have to.<eos> He doesn't want to confess but after you talk, we'll have enough to charge him, so if you don't feel it...<eos> I need to know or it'll haunt me my whole life.<eos> But those images of armless women, the name Livia, how could I know about it?<eos> It's simple.<eos> I talked to you at the hospital at night.<eos> You were sedated.<eos> I would give you very detailed and graphic descriptions.<eos> I whispered the name to you.<eos> I knew it would make its way to your unconscious.
So the letter is my only chance of clearing my family's name.<eos> Now you know who I am, shall we go?<eos> Nguyen Vu!<eos> Nguyen Vu!<eos> - What's that?<eos> That's him!<eos> Nguyen Vu, look!<eos> Brother, what's happened here?<eos> - The blood letter<eos> What is it?
We're never gonna have sex again, are we?<eos> Aw. Happy Valentine's day.<eos> Okay, baby.<eos> Well, listen, I can babysit tonight if you guys need some time to... yourselves.<eos> 'Cause I have, uh, no plans 'cause my life is empty.<eos> I'm alone with no plans whatsoever, at all.<eos> That's great.<eos> So did you, um, did you make a reservation somewhere beautiful with lots of flickery candles?<eos> I made a plan.<eos> I think you'll like it.
Our... our thing is... is young and fragile, too.<eos> We're gonna get a zillion valen-traumas.<eos> I bet a few of them will be good surgeries for our boards.<eos> Well, it's not St. Patty's day.<eos> - Those are good traumas...<eos> car crashes, bar brawls. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Valentine's day is all swallowed engagement rings and guys who threw out their backs getting laid.<eos> You're just bitter 'cause you don't have a date.<eos> First of all, Valentine's day isn't for having a date with some chick. - Mm-hmm.<eos> No, it's for macking the chicks who don't have dates.
Um, his, uh, abdominal pain's decreased, and I think it's a good time to schedule a gastroscopy.<eos> Great, great.<eos> Well, then, you're in luck, Dr. Peterson, because I think that Karev would be an excellent supervisor for your first gastroscopy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, uh, Megan.<eos> Let's go schedule that gastroscopy.<eos> Uh, it-it's Morgan.<eos> What is?<eos> My name.<eos> It's Morgan.
And I-I read that in... in-in the file, the file that you...<eos> Carrie's file... that you gave me to read, I...<eos> I did... I did read it.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Oh, we've got a big bleeder here.<eos> Is that subclavian?<eos> Respectfully, doctors,<eos> I told you so.<eos> Okay, so I think it'll work.<eos> If we cut down the macerated part of the finger, it'll be short, but it'll still be salvageable.
The thumb is responsible for 40% of hand function.<eos> Without it, we're done.<eos> But there's gotta be something else.<eos> I mean, I read something about surgeons using a man's big toe as... as a replacement for a thumb.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> Let's...<eos> let's use his big toe.<eos> Listen, Dr. Frankenstein, the big toe, it's pretty important, you know, for walking.<eos> And he can learn to rebalance.<eos> Or he can keep his toe where it is.
Have you seen my wife?<eos> As a matter of fact, I have.<eos> She just threatened to quit.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Wash your laundry at home, not in my O.R.<eos> Well, oh, there's two sides to every story...<eos> Yeah, I'm not interested in your side.<eos> Derek, Richard and I had very high hopes for you, but you have been nothing but a disappointment.<eos> You don't publish, you don't teach, your attitude is terrible.<eos> The residents have a nickname for you, and it is not flattering.
We'll just take it one step at a time.<eos> I want to make it work.<eos> It isn't your baby.<eos> It's stupid, I know, but it's a brand-new shirt and now it's got junkie blood all over it.<eos> Oh. This is awkward.<eos> Clear.<eos> I've got a rhythm.<eos> Barely, but...<eos> Damn it.<eos> It's gone.
Some things are going to work out as if they were destined to happen...<eos> Ugh.<eos> I gotta go get some sleep.<eos> You gotta get some sleep.<eos> You look like crap.<eos> I look better than you.<eos> Not possible.<eos> Your mother says the residents have a name for me.<eos> I wouldn't know anything about that.<eos> What is it?
Subtitles by Shadadda<eos> Halt.<eos> Halt.<eos> You've had enough tonight, Benny.<eos> - I won't let the law dictate to me.<eos> I'll call a taxi for you.<eos> - No, I'll walk.<eos> A journalist up north was in a hit and run last night.<eos> The police think it was intentional.
We don't know anybody in France.<eos> It came last week.<eos> Kurt was agitated a lot about it.<eos> Don't know who the sender was?<eos> - No. But I saw him on the phone.<eos> I asked who it was, but he wouldn't say.<eos> He seemed scared.<eos> That was nothing for him.<eos> This morning there was another letter.<eos> It was so scary I'm threw it out.
My father... is dead, Declan, just like yours.<eos> Truth is a battle of perceptions.<eos> People only see what they're prepared to confront.<eos> Charlotte.<eos> It's not what you look at that matters, but what you see.<eos> Jack saw the tape, Nolan.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The degausser didn't work.<eos> It's a relic.
Winona left me.<eos> Well, shit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Well, Raylan, I'm sorry about that.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> - But you're...<eos> - No.<eos> Don't need a pep talk.<eos> Just a few days off to get my head straight.<eos> You're gonna have to head down to Harlan and take care of this shit before it blows up all over this office.
There's no way Givens is onto our clinic that fast without an inside lead.<eos> I'm just surprised that Crowder has that kind of pull.<eos> I mean, to have a marshal in your back pocket, that is a big play.<eos> Yeah.<eos> "Yeah" what?<eos> Givens' father, Arlo, is a part of Boyd's crew.<eos> So, how was your day, son?<eos> Was it a good day?<eos> Was it a productive day?<eos> Was it memorable?
You can trust me.<eos> We're very close to each other now, can you feel it?<eos> Give...<eos> - How do I know you will let me go? - I give you my word.<eos> You're not of any value to me.<eos> I could shoot you right now. All I want is the code.<eos> Give it to me and you're free to go.<eos> Oops.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> It's yours now.
- Correct!<eos> Brown question.<eos> Don't you wanna play, Kevin?<eos> You read it.<eos> Who wrote the novel about Arvid Falk?<eos> Wait...<eos> Say it.<eos> August Strindberg.<eos> Correct.<eos> It's called "The Red Room".
- Crap game... - I agree.<eos> Nothing to write home about.<eos> Ove!<eos> - See you. - Yeah, bye.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - With? My client.<eos> Should have told you.<eos> He's in observation. - The case is closed?<eos> - I'm afraid so.<eos> - It can't be closed.
We're looking for the same thing.<eos> But you wouldn't recognize it without me, and I wouldn't find it without you.<eos> As you know, my father and David Eischer were good friends.<eos> David carried on with research while my father started Hub market.<eos> Will we be talking today?<eos> Yes.<eos> Inger Engman.<eos> Leo Eischer.<eos> The code David made can't be extracted from the system where it's installed.<eos> That means, you could only spread it by way of the original, the source code.
We just do our job.<eos> We want to help you and the entire population from chaos.<eos> The code...<eos> There's a source code that your father developed.<eos> By which you and your group are contaminated with, and in possession of.<eos> We want that code. So we can take it to the right people.<eos> That's all...<eos> I just ask for your cooperation.<eos> We're prepared to do a great deal for you, if you help us.<eos> Where is it?
Well, are you sure it's accurate?<eos> Very sure.<eos> I got a 94.<eos> I know.<eos> How could I get a 94 on a test I didn't complete?<eos> I think somebody did something to the test paper before you graded it, and I just want you to know I had nothing to do with it.<eos> Emily, it's all right.<eos> The test was completed.<eos> I don't think you understand.<eos> If it was completed, it wasn't completed by me.
"Hotmama loves tango?"<eos> I'm going to kill Aria.<eos> How do I delete this?<eos> No, I wouldn't do that.<eos> I know there's some strange people on here, but did you know that Jane foster met her second and her third husbands on this site?<eos> Perfect.<eos> Seriously.<eos> I've met some good guys too.<eos> It's not easy to do at our age.<eos> The pool we're swimming in is much shallower than it used to be.
Then we started fighting for any little thing.<eos> Sabine could not bear to see me up all night. When she caught me drinking I left.<eos> I moved to this house.<eos> It's too big for me.<eos> I correct essays.<eos> Correspondence courses.<eos> It's working.<eos> She went looking for you... and I've isolated here.<eos> Alcohol me a little anesthesia.<eos> But it does not help me sleep.
I knew she was behind this!<eos> You listen to me, if you want to be a man, you can't let a woman tell you what to do!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I can't believe these people won the Cold War.<eos> Now, can we please change the subject?<eos> Fine.<eos> Explain why you've been gone so long and I haven't gotten a single letter.<eos> Not even a lousy postcard!<eos> You know, I'm growing to like American football.<eos> Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?

There's no need for histrionics just yet.<eos> Histrionics?<eos> This is the gravest day I've ever known.<eos> Jessica, let me handle this.<eos> Why do you think I'm here?<eos> Screw you.<eos> Mine likes to be scolded too.<eos> I keep getting these dating site pop-ups.<eos> It's like my computer's accusing me of being single.<eos> Do you know why it's doing that?
It's damning, and it implicates you in a cover-up.<eos> Never crossed my desk.<eos> I'm not saying it did.<eos> I'm saying it looks bad. I don't want Daniel knowing about this.<eos> I got nothing to hide.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I believe you, but you're not my only concern at the moment.<eos> You know full well what Daniel will do if he finds out you're being accused of fraud and it happened on my watch.<eos> He'll use it against us, but I also know that he's familiar with the people at CM, and he's bound to find out sooner or later.<eos> Then make it go away before it gets to sooner.
I need everything you got for me first thing tomorrow.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> Yes, immediately.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What happened with Judge Follman?<eos> There might be a slight problem.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Why do you assume I did something?<eos> - What did you do? - There was a prank.<eos> How bad was it?
I didn't kill Archer!<eos> Then why were you trying to steal his body?<eos> I'm not stealing him, either.<eos> I told you--<eos> I need to perform a ritual to release the bad energy before his journey to the afterlife.<eos> There was something inside Braddock, wasn't there?<eos> Something that would lead directly to you if the coroner discovered it.<eos> You never did share the proprietary blend of that stinky special tea of yours, did you?<eos> The tea of clarity?<eos> It was killing him quicker than the cancer.
You asked me here to talk about art, Mr. Ballard?<eos> A subject which bores me to tears except for this particular picture.<eos> It was painted in 1533, a period of intense economic unrest in Europe, but not unlike today.<eos> Some think it was commissioned by a French ambassador, but I believe it was British merchants.<eos> Is this supposed to interest me?<eos> It should.<eos> These merchants felt constrained by their governments who wrote the laws and levied the taxes. So they formed a secret pact.<eos> They called it Hourglass.<eos> You see the skull?<eos> It's distorted.
How can you live with yourself?<eos> - My daughter is a child.<eos> - You think that I'm the devil.<eos> That is wrong.<eos> Even in a content life there is sin.<eos> You can't escape that, Jack.<eos> Ask yourself how you learn to live with your sins.<eos> You'll come to the same conclusion as every thinking human being... since they burned heretics. There is no God.<eos> Death is nothing.<eos> It is just nothingness.
Knights in shining armor.<eos> From my understanding, they come from a dragon-like lineage.<eos> Oh, I thought dragons were mythological.<eos> Dragons are. Daemonfeuers aren't.<eos> Well, so can they breathe fire?<eos> Well, in an obtuse way, I guess they can, yeah.<eos> I mean, from my understanding, and I'm telling you, I am not an expert on this, it's a kind of ketonic...<eos> What's the word I'm looking for... vomit.<eos> You ever hear of the low-carb, high-fat diet?<eos> Puts your body in a state of ketosis, where it burns its own fat.
You and I never really liked each other.<eos> - We haven't?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, I definitely meant what I said.<eos> Whatever you need, consider it done.<eos> Good.<eos> I want you to help kill me.<eos> Um... maybe we should talk about this inside.<eos> Karen, you can't seriously be considering this.<eos> Listen, cancer's a bully, and when it's as bad as mine, it laughs at our pathetic little attempts to fight it.
What about bugs?<eos> Bugs are annoying.<eos> We don't want bugs in heaven.<eos> What about the animals that eat the bugs?<eos> Won't they starve?<eos> You're right.<eos> There are bugs in heaven.<eos> But if all the people and all the animals and all the bugs that ever lived go to heaven, isn't it super crowded?<eos> No, sweetie. Heaven is perfect.<eos> How is it perfect?

I gave him two girls who hate sports, so he'll be thrilled.<eos> Mike was always checking the tires on our car with this thingy.<eos> I don't know where the thingy is.<eos> I just know it was important and it kept us safe. Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Tom's still taking care of our cars.<eos> I'll just tell him to add yours to his to-do list from now on.<eos> Susan, we are gonna do everything we can to hold you up, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes, as much as death takes from us, it also gives.
but this Cui...may I ask for him in exchange?<eos> He is a criminal suspect! No I'm not!<eos> We asked him to help with out investigation.<eos> I'd very much appreciate if you let him go.<eos> Lord Liu, we shouldn't trouble the king with minor disputes like this...<eos> I understand. Release him!<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Get moving!<eos> Lord An, our mission is complete!<eos> Is it?
- Wait. How, uh... Who alerted the media?<eos> Well, there's a picture online of Daniel in his bloody tux.<eos> Someone from the party must have snapped it. Oh, well, so much for decorum.<eos> She's right.<eos> It's everywhere.<eos> "Bloody Billionaire Beach Battle"?<eos> Do the police really think Daniel killed Tyler?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Well, Dad took the helicopter into the city.<eos> When it returns, I've made sure the best defense attorney in Manhattan is gonna be on board.
Good, but you are stoned, though, aren't you.<eos> I thought it would make it easier to eat again.<eos> Pot and nothing else, ever, you understand me?<eos> You don't have to worry about me, Mom. Yeah, I do.<eos> It's my job.<eos> I cleared the table and started the dishes.<eos> Sorry I reacted the way I did.<eos> I was just surprised.<eos> I thought you were happy with the book. I was.<eos> It just didn't seem like my book anymore. It felt like someone else's.
Oh, I actually... brought you an ARC of my new book.<eos> Stalking and a present.<eos> Under the Pink by Samantha Borgens.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Well, I will...<eos> I will read this over break.<eos> Probably aloud.<eos> My mom and I have been tearing through some books lately.<eos> No, you can't read it to her.<eos> It's filled with sex and profanity.
Come here.<eos> How was your Christmas?<eos> It was good.<eos> Filled with family.<eos> So you haven't mentioned my book.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> So you didn't like it?<eos> No, no, that's not it.<eos> I liked it a lot.<eos> It's incredibly well written. The characters are vibrant and alive.
Congratulations.<eos> But I don't get the connection.<eos> I was suffering the absurd illusion that I'd be moving in with the most incredible art in the world.<eos> And without the sub, I couldn't decorate. I got you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And why go to pottery barn when you can accent with 6,000-year stolen amphora?<eos> Exactly.<eos> To a long overdue reunion.<eos> So, that night, I set up at the weigh station near the docks.<eos> I figured I could drop onto Adler's truck as it passed.
I assumed, if you meant to steal it, you'd let me know.<eos> Well, in all fairness, you did just say that you planned to steal it without us, right?<eos> Right.<eos> But I wouldn't have cut you out.<eos> Really?<eos> Equal thirds?<eos> Well, maybe not equal.<eos> I have missed you, Neal.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And in all honesty, that treasure you wanted so badly has been a lot more trouble than it's worth.
- Time?<eos> You didn't...<eos> You didn't have time to make a phone call so that I could... I don't know... fucking arrest him<eos> - or something? - His flight was leaving. His...<eos> How do you know he killed Mike?<eos> I found his fingerprint at the scene.<eos> And you didn't tell me?<eos> You kept it from the police department?<eos> Dex, so what happened to you only taking care of people that slip through the cracks of the justice system?<eos> You can't rip a case wide open so that it conveniently falls into your fucking lap!
Killing Isaak would make a lot of Koshkas very angry...<eos> But a lot of Colombians very happy.<eos> The goddamn shower has two settings... scalding and freezing.<eos> It's a cheap motel.<eos> That's the point.<eos> I'm not doing this another night.<eos> Hopefully we won't have to.<eos> Does that mean you're working on a solution?<eos> I have a plan, yes.<eos> Does it involve you killing someone?
The longer they're in the bloodstream, the more sensitive they become.<eos> Causing them to spontaneously combust.<eos> - Am I gonna die?<eos> - Jessica.<eos> - I just want you to focus on me, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Walter, what just happened to me?<eos> - Cortexiphan has given you certain kinetic powers.<eos> Jones!<eos> I knew Jones' plan was too ingenious that it had to have come from Belly.
I hope they caught him.<eos> Well, they didn't, but...<eos> Somebody did.<eos> All right, well, sorry for calling so late.<eos> Hey, don't worry about it.<eos> Especially if it's about a Klaustreich.<eos> Sleep with one eye open.<eos> Now, I have the whole day planned.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Well, it starts with a trip into beautiful downtown whispering pines... - Okay.
- "Unbezahlbar."<eos> - "Unbezahlbar."<eos> - My brother has a book.<eos> Hang on, we're looking.<eos> Here it is.<eos> - Oh, here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Uh, it is a dense mineral deposit which grows in the throat sack.<eos> It develops something like an egg.<eos> Anyway, um, yeah, if the stone gets too big, it needs to be delivered, and the trick is getting it out intact, because if it's damaged, it's, you know, worthless.
Not if you add in what happened afterward.<eos> Ooh. Yeah, or after that.<eos> She has your card, she knows she can call us.<eos> Right.<eos> We did everything we could do.<eos> - You're right.<eos> - Mmm.<eos> We did, now back to us.<eos> You should try the tea.<eos> It's new.
I don't know how to do this.<eos> You have to... Take it out.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Rosalee?<eos> Hey, Nick Burkhardt here.<eos> I need your help.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Well, I'm with... Robin, the Seltenvogel.<eos> Nick, you need to get that stone out of her before it cuts off her airway.
Strike whom?<eos> Me. So why would he kill Marigold?<eos> It's a game, of cat and mouse.<eos> He knew Prudence Stanley was my aunt.<eos> It's been all over the society pages with Guy's engagement.<eos> Foyle's dead, Phryne.<eos> But Arthur said it was the same man who took Janey.<eos> He identified him in a police line-up!<eos> With all due respect, your cousin can't pick the difference between fairytales and reality.<eos> Why connect it with Foyle?
Night's young.<eos> Miss Fisher!<eos> I thought you were in your compartment.<eos> I tried my best, but I'm not good with confined spaces.<eos> I'm sure the local sergeant has things under control.<eos> The local sergeant couldn't control a country cake stall.<eos> I know Mr Henderson was on the train after Bacchus Marsh station because I saw her reboard.<eos> Where did the train stop after that?<eos> Nowhere. It's an express to Ballarat.<eos> But I felt it stop!
There you go again. Shazbot!<eos> And now you'd better run along, sweetheart.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Whoo-hoo!<eos> I'm dry!<eos> Come on, everybody, feel Daddy's underpants!<eos> We'll take your word for it.<eos> So what do I do again?<eos> Spin the top.<eos> If it falls over, we're in reality.

- Man, it's not our garden!<eos> So why are we here at all?<eos> Why's the grass all wet?<eos> - Why are you drawing tits on him? - Tits're all I can draw.<eos> - They look like shit.<eos> - I'm sure yours are prettier.<eos> Piggyback! You'll fall down!<eos> - Where did you leave the key, man?<eos> - I thought you put it down here.<eos> There it is!
[ Whining ] I hate it when we like the same guy!<eos> He died in the 16th century.<eos> Pioneered the autopsy.<eos> I'd be Maura Dorthea Isles Benivieni. Wow.<eos> Dorthea?<eos> And you laughed at Clementine?<eos> Dorthea?<eos> ! I didn't laugh.<eos> I smiled. I liked it.<eos> And I -- and I like this name, too, 'cause, you know, it's the name of a famous artist.
You did it for everyone because that's who you are... leaders, heroes, princes and princesses, and that's great and... and amazing and... wonderful, but it doesn't change the fact that for my entire life<eos> I've been alone.<eos> But if we hadn't sent you away, you would have been cursed, too.<eos> But we would've been together.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's...<eos> let's go find Gold.<eos> We should camp here tonight.<eos> The wraith only appears when light is absent.<eos> That's why it ran when it first appeared.
Hello?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Hey!<eos> Aah! Over here!<eos> What the hell was that thing?<eos> A wraith!<eos> Did I...<eos> Kill it?<eos> No, it's regenerating.<eos> It'll be back.
Who's there?<eos> Hey!<eos> Aah! Over here!<eos> What the hell was that thing?<eos> A wraith!<eos> Did I...<eos> Kill it?<eos> No, it's regenerating.<eos> It'll be back.<eos> It doesn't stop until it devours its prey.
Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one?<eos> I already have a picture of me and Howard's mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach.<eos> I've suffered enough.<eos> Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it's kind of heavy.<eos> Oh, too bad you're not as strong as the dude in the painting.<eos> Would you look at this?<eos> I paid $25 to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand.<eos> He sent me a stick.<eos> He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.<eos> It's numbered.
We know the body had been there for some time.<eos> I might say for a considerable period of time. Yeah.<eos> Possibly several months, if not several months.<eos> Possibly several months.<eos> Possibly.<eos> God, I hate this.<eos> - Do I look all right?<eos> - You look fabulous.<eos> How many months do you reckon it was there?
Whoever did it used an MO almost identical to Jeremy Leach's.<eos> The details of which, for obvious reasons, were never released to the press.<eos> For instance... he used cable ties to fasten his victim's thumbs together.<eos> It's all in there, even the victim profile fits.<eos> White, 32-year-old professional.<eos> But it can't be him? It's unlikely.<eos> He's been tucked up at Her Majesty's pleasure for the last thirteen years.<eos> He's not looking at parole till 2036, if ever. So it's a copycat thing? Yeah.<eos> Didn't he get convicted over a single thumb print?<eos> Not even that. It was a partial thumb print.
I made a really bad decision once. What?<eos> It was when Sammy was four.<eos> I realised way back then that Dave was mucking about with another woman and I... buried my head in the sand.<eos> I was in love with the man I wanted him to be not the man he clearly was, and I ignored it.<eos> Pretended it wasn't happening.<eos> And if I'd had the guts to deal with it then instead of later when I had to, when he went off with...<eos> Everything would've been so much better for Sammy, but for me as well because I'd have got myself organised so I didn't have to stop working at the Faculty. I was good at that job, Rachel, I loved it.<eos> I know I was born for it, and...<eos> I'd almost forgotten how much till these last few days.<eos> I'd forgotten how alive it made me feel.
Yeah, just the thought of my daughter out there in this movie, it...<eos> - But you agreed to an interview?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Our daughter had just died, and she...<eos> He said that this documentary was an attempt to keep people from committing suicide, and it's just to make money.<eos> Objection.<eos> Your Honor, opinion.<eos> To me, Your Honor, this is the whole point of the case.<eos> This is a wrongful death suit.<eos> And he sold this movie as an anti-suicide documentary when, in fact, it was intended to induce and encourage suicide.
You're not... sure?<eos> I don't know how to answer.<eos> - With the truth.<eos> - I have<eos> - an obligation. - No.<eos> You're a private investigator.<eos> You don't have attorney-client privilege.<eos> Here's the problem, Kalinda... the IRS is investigating you because of this check.<eos> $3,850.<eos> It was written from what they determined is a dummy account, and now they want accounting for all your freelance work over the last three tax periods.
I never try to make enemies.<eos> Whenever I disagree with someone, I think:<eos> Today I can't see their side, but tomorrow, who knows?<eos> - So y-you see my side?<eos> - Well, I've come to present you with the report from our blue ribbon panel.<eos> - I recused myself.<eos> - Yes, but we've changed our conclusions...<eos> you convinced us.<eos> We censure the officers for not announcing themselves, shooting an unarmed man, and possibly even placing a drop gun in his hand to cover their tracks.<eos> And it also censures my husband for covering it up?
No, no this is perfect.<eos> Would you like to sit down?<eos> Just let me run to the little boys rooms first.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Who is that?<eos> That's Sophie's new boyfriend. I see, and where's his boyfriend?<eos> Hello.<eos> Nice to see you again. I'm wearing my velour especially for you.<eos> And right now, it's the only thing soft about me.
Rosa needed.<eos> Why do you want me to deport her instead of me?<eos> I do not want to expel anyone.<eos> I just want to go back to school.<eos> She likes school and stuff.<eos> See you.<eos> - Good morning, boss!<eos> - Good day.<eos> - You freíste bacon?<eos> - Yes, it is there.
Confidence. It cuts both ways.<eos> Tell me.<eos> What did you see in your hallucinations?<eos> Ezra.<eos> Your father.<eos> History rewritten.<eos> Creatures.<eos> So many voices.<eos> The din drowned out all reason. I tried.<eos> I tried on my own to silence it, but it only grew louder.
What is it?<eos> Oh, you... you didn't come home.<eos> Uh, yeah, there was a bus crash.<eos> Wh... uh, what time is it?<eos> What are you... what are you doing here?<eos> I just, um... I figured you had a rough night, so... I brought you some coffee.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It takes an extreme amount of caution...<eos> Wh-where is it?
Rawr!<eos> Good, Zola.<eos> Rawr.<eos> That's what a lion says.<eos> Is that a...<eos> That's a lion.<eos> We have a phrase in the operating room,<eos> - "Don't pet the lion."<eos> - Rawr.<eos> It means, no matter how nice a tumor looks, how small it is, how perfect its margins may be...
An actual lion?<eos> Looking at me like I was lunch.<eos> Are you sure it wasn't a mountain lion or... maybe a well-fed cat?<eos> I was staring at Simba.<eos> Grey, you're on my service.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - See you.<eos> Hey.<eos> I-I saw a lion today, walking across the street.<eos> Derek and I were coming back from the house, and it was just standing there in the street.
I-I saw a lion today, walking across the street.<eos> Derek and I were coming back from the house, and it was just standing there in the street.<eos> Cristina's not talking to me.<eos> Okay, how come no one is concerned about the fact that I saw a lion walking around Seattle?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was just, uh...<eos> You can't force Cristina to open up.<eos> You have to just let her come to you.<eos> In the meantime, look at this. Animal control came. One dart, and he was down.<eos> It walked across the road, right in front of us.
They got here this morning before I did.<eos> What do you think he's doing about all this?<eos> No idea.<eos> All I know is how he spent the night.<eos> He come out at all? Make or take any calls?<eos> One from the governor, that's it.<eos> Yes?<eos> Cullen's on his way up.<eos> We'll need the briefing room.<eos> Please do what you can to make it look presentable.
- He did it all himself.<eos> - That's pretty awesome.<eos> - Yummy.<eos> You know what? I think you need a little bit more sunscreen, Harrison.<eos> Hey, buddy, you know what this place needs? A moat.<eos> Keep the bad guys out.<eos> I'll be back in a minute.<eos> Can I have some of that leg?<eos> I miss the beach.<eos> It reminds me of Mom.
Think I'm some fucking asshole, one of your bag men?<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> - I could fuck you up.<eos> It goes two ways, detective.<eos> You destroyed police evidence.<eos> That'll get you thrown off the force.<eos> Hell, you'd probably do time.<eos> - Stay the fuck away from me.<eos> - That's not gonna happen, Joey.<eos> So you think real hard about your next move... and what it means for your future.
He wasn't embalmed.<eos> - Yeah. And surprise, it was at the discretion of...<eos> - ... Hannah. - Hannah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That poor woman had to watch her dead brother be dug up. And for what?<eos> I put her through fucking hell.<eos> You couldn't anticipate this. It's not your fault.<eos> Well, it doesn't make it any better.<eos> Sometimes my job really fucking sucks.<eos> Actually, it always sucks.
Call it in on the tip line?<eos> I'm not sure I can.<eos> Deb was right.<eos> Now that I have proof, my urges are beyond my control.<eos> Your Dark Passenger.<eos> Where did you come up with that, anyway?<eos> - Thought I got it from you.<eos> - I gave you the code.<eos> The Dark Passenger was all yours.<eos> You said it got into me too early in that shipping container.
Everything, I suppose.<eos> I'm sure the Koshkas would have saw to that.<eos> What if he knows you're after me and can't track you down?<eos> Well, he'll probably come after you, hoping to find me.<eos> So let's let him.<eos> You're willing to be bait?<eos> You're the one who wanted the element of surprise.<eos> I got your text.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Unis found Jurg's car at a park, but it was abandoned. That's all I could find.
I guess that I'm sorry. You guess?<eos> Fuck's sakes, Dexter.<eos> She needs to know how you feel about her.<eos> It's not that easy.<eos> How is it you can be absolutely fearless in the face of death and yet so afraid to live?<eos> I'm not.<eos> Afraid.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> Death has always calmed me.<eos> It's soothing.
Let's go, Hawks!<eos> Let's go, Hawks!<eos> Let's go, Hawks!<eos> Let's go, Hawks! Here come the Hawks to the line of scrimmage.<eos> This will be the final play of the first quarter.<eos> Toes Kittridge has split out right,<eos> Caldwell under center.<eos> Kittridge has a step on him.<eos> He's got it for a touchdown!<eos> Toes Kittridge in his first touchdown as a Hawk, and it's a beauty!
- Oh, no. I got one. I got one.<eos> Remember that time we went golfing together, - and you got a hole-in-one?<eos> - Yeah? You never got a hole-in-one.<eos> I got bored and I kicked it in the hole. This is fun.<eos> Here's a corker.<eos> They didn't used to label babies as carefully in hospitals,<eos> - so for two days--<eos> - Not now, Phil.<eos> What do you mean, you-- you kicked the ball in the hole?<eos> What, was it, like, on the edge?
Poor baby.<eos> But I did it.<eos> I survived.<eos> I wasn't sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit.<eos> I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death.<eos> But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost.<eos> You're so brave.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> I ate a butterfly.<eos> It was so small and... beautiful, but I was so hungry.
You should know that.<eos> I can't keep doing this, Mary.<eos> I could lose my job.<eos> You give me what I want, or you're going to lose a lot more than your job.<eos> Now, who do I get to be next?<eos> You said a woman this time, right?<eos> Well, men tend to hold a grudge.<eos> Try this one instead.<eos> Your name's not Mary either.<eos> It's Tara.
All right, I'll give it a shot.<eos> No, no, no, no! No. No.<eos> That's not Bobo.<eos> That's Ed.<eos> Look, I don't even belong here.<eos> The court just wants you to sign this piece of paper that says I showed up.<eos> You sign it now, I can bounce and you can check out my ass when I leave.<eos> I've already checked out your ass.<eos> It's one of the best ones in the group.<eos> It'll look even better if you put it in that chair so we can start.
What is it, Karev?<eos> Uh, Jane Doe, looks to be around 15 years old.<eos> Hunt wants you to take a look at her.<eos> Hey, any word back on my interviews?<eos> Uh, yeah, I'm working on it.<eos> The angle's off on this elbow.<eos> You've been working on it for a couple of weeks now.<eos> Well, you're an acquired taste, like blue cheese.<eos> Some people love it and some people can't stand to be in the same room with it.<eos> They think it's stinky.
I am a soldier.<eos> I'm a s-soldier. No, no.<eos> I want to hear you mean it.<eos> Repeat.<eos> I am a soldier.<eos> I am a soldier.<eos> - Now get on the bus. - Okay.<eos> Karev?<eos> Now have salmon for dinner.<eos> And tell room service to make sure it's not frozen.

Damn.<eos> And if they're here...<eos> They're gonna be everywhere.<eos> The temporalis muscle is atrophied.<eos> Any idea why, Dr. Grey?<eos> Uh, lack of use?<eos> It had nowhere to attach since the bone was gone.<eos> That's right.<eos> It's too late for this muscle.<eos> It's missed its chance to attach.
Yeah, then we got divorced.<eos> Then we went to Fiji the next time.<eos> The beaches.<eos> Yeah, and then we got divorced.<eos> This time, my bride, she insisted on Thailand.<eos> We just can't seem to stay way from each other.<eos> Con-- congratulations.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So this patch here is your tumor.<eos> It's invading the wall of your right ventricle.
So I didn't see any further damage from the parasite on your scans.<eos> That's great, but you can't just leave a worm inside of him forever.<eos> This thing has teeth.<eos> You have to get it out of me, please.<eos> You know, I have a worm inside of me, too, but you don't hear me crying about it.<eos> Yours is in your arm, and they're taking it out today.<eos> Mine could be anywhere.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My penis.<eos> It's not gonna get to your-- It doesn't do that, does it?
when she gets back.<eos> I have lingerie and flavored body paint... oh, there is a God.<eos> Okay, ready?<eos> On my count. One, two... Three.<eos> Again.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Lexie, run it down for me.<eos> My legs and my pelvis are crushed.<eos> And I can't f-feel my other arm, so I'm not sure it's even there anymore.
It's nothing.<eos> It's a blip.<eos> And in the meantime, you're missing your moment.<eos> You survived residency.<eos> Stop and celebrate that.<eos> 'Cause life... changes in an instant.<eos> It turns on a dime.<eos> One minute you're miserable, and then the next...<eos> You've met the most amazing woman in the world and are in love.<eos> This moment, your moment, it only happens once.
Your father? Get in there. Fine.<eos> Sir... I-I can't... oh, for God sakes!<eos> Let her hate us.<eos> You turned out great.<eos> I did, didn't I?<eos> You're a big lawyer.<eos> This is not the massage I had in mind.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay. In about an hour, a train goes through town that will get us close to pebble beach.<eos> Now it's not technically a-a passenger train, so it won't be stopping.
There's an army insignia on it.<eos> In a box, okay?<eos> Top shelf, bedroom closet. Okay?<eos> Please.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> He's, uh, over by that tree. There.<eos> I need an ambulance at the Willow Wood cemetery as soon as possible.<eos> God, Jane!<eos> What'd you find?<eos> Cho said they found the key ring in the exact place Marx said it would be.
I tried calling you hundreds of times, begging you to talk to me, begging you to get help.<eos> Not a reply.<eos> Not a word.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You know what?<eos> I have not been sleeping. I've been-- forget it.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Y-you know, you're a jerk.<eos> And your plan?<eos> It's stupid.
You think it's some kind of abuse?<eos> Could be, although his folks don't have a record.<eos> Anyway, he called in sick to school today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Cho and I will check it out.<eos> Gladly.<eos> That guilty creatures sitting in a play have, by the-- the cunning of the scene, so struck to the soul that presently... they have proclaimed their malefactions, their shortcomings.<eos> Mind if I borrow some of this?<eos> Thank you.<eos> For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most...
you say this now...<eos> Look, I know that I'm a shitty wife and I'm not winning any Mother of the Year awards,<eos> but I need you to know that... not for one second do I think there is malice in your heart.<eos> You're not a killer, and I know that.<eos> I know that, so... so do whatever you gotta do to keep this group safe.<eos> And do it with a clear conscience.<eos> Why do I need this when I got this?<eos> Daryl: You don't fire guns, not unless your back's up against a wall.<eos> Noise attracts them.<eos> It really riles them up.
Whoa, wh--have you mentioned to Louis that you're allergic?<eos> I tried to, but he said that--<eos> Allergies are a sign of weakness.<eos> Right, and bringing your cat to work is a sign of strength.<eos> Yeah, you want to trade places?<eos> Uh, nope. No, I got a meeting in the conference room.<eos> That's right, that little tennis fling.<eos> Makes me sick.<eos> Harvey's got no appreciation for the game.<eos> Man wouldn't know topspin if it hit him in the ball sack.
It's the perfect location.<eos> There's no neighbors, close to major highways...<eos> I'll cover all the new start-up costs.<eos> Then we split everything 50-50.<eos> Diosa Norte.<eos> Partners, huh?<eos> I got an endgame in sight, too.<eos> My best friend is lying in a box in the other room.<eos> I gotta start moving us away from the shit that's killing us.<eos> I'm sorry about your friend in there, but I tell you straight-up, though, if we were to do a deal... it would have to be completely clear of all your other traffic.
Right now, they are in a command crisis.<eos> Their master is dead.<eos> They're looking for orders.<eos> Let me go down there.<eos> You?<eos> You're their enemy.<eos> Division agents only respect what they've been made to fear.<eos> They've been made to fear me.<eos> My fight was never with you.<eos> It was with Percy. You know this.
Keep an eye on him, Jack.<eos> What do you know?<eos> Edward R. Murrow.<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> Hey, hey, get away from there.<eos> Sir, uh, we're detectives.<eos> We just want to ask you some questions.<eos> I've got a question for you, Detective.<eos> You got a warrant to search my computer?<eos> I wasn't searching your computer; it was open.
- Did I?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And you bent the phrasing like you were channeling Sinatra.<eos> Wasn't on purpose.<eos> Ring-a-ding-ding.<eos> Grandpa had very good sleep last night.<eos> Woke up a new man.<eos> Full of vim and vigor.<eos> Now, boys, to make a proper Irish coffee, the last step is crucial, so pay attention to this.<eos> You have to ladle the cream over the back of the spoon, so it doesn't just plop in and muddy the coffee and the whiskey.
Hand me my dress.<eos> Who were you talking to about the bike yesterday?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't want you selling my bike to anyone else.<eos> Here.<eos> I made you a mix tape, since we're friends now.<eos> But don't sell my bike.<eos> God willing.<eos> Ms Hussa will explain the rules of the Koran competition.<eos> It's only five weeks away.
To discuss more service compensation.<eos> I would make up the hours.<eos> You want the evening off?<eos> If you don't mind.<eos> That doesn't look like a rhinoceros.<eos> Let's not make a habit of it. Thank you.<eos> Mississippi choo-choo.<eos> The rhinoceros is waiting for the train.<eos> See?<eos> I love to see the steam when you start puffing it looks like the icing on a sugar muffin
Unless it was for something important.<eos> And does it make sense that whoever killed Finch might have been in the house looking for the same important stash?<eos> Which would make Finch's killer an associate, like the aforementioned Jonjo Heinz.<eos> Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> But what?<eos> But nothing.<eos> I keep saying it, but he was there.<eos> On the night. He was one of them.<eos> The evidence must be there somewhere.<eos> Yeah, but it has to be conclusive.
Shall I ask her?<eos> No, that's negative.<eos> 'John Paul wants to know how to woo...' ..a woman.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Dad, pack it in. 'Tell him a romantic dinner for two...' ..never goes out of fashion.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Hi, bollocks.<eos> 'Look, I'm joking, son.'<eos> If you think she's worth making a fool of yourself for, then you do it.<eos> 'Oh, and I appreciate you asking me for my advice, 'even though it's not worth a carrot.'
And what Daniel Hardman's been doing for the last five years is dreaming of the day he comes back and screws us both out of our jobs.<eos> There's an easy way to find out.<eos> Then let's do it.<eos> 'Cause I can tell you this, that asshole's coming back.<eos> And he isn't coming because he wants to be number two.<eos> I got to say, he looks good.<eos> Being a prick keeps you handsome.<eos> Are you saying that I'm handsome?<eos> The fact that you think that comment was directed at you makes you self-centered and vain at the same time.<eos> Doesn't mean it wasn't directed at me.
That's why I don't like him.<eos> "There can be only one."<eos> We're at a funeral, and you're quoting Highlander?<eos> Yeah, a lot of people die in it.<eos> Seems appropriate.<eos> You know the one key difference between the two of us?<eos> He's a lying snake in the grass who'll say or do anything.<eos> Mr. Ross, the truth is I don't remember where the James Jenkins pitch came from.<eos> Then it could have come from Myra.<eos> Well, it could have, but it doesn't matter.
You sure not calling backup's the way to go here?<eos> You don't get it, Fusco.<eos> You see those two in the suits?<eos> They work Vice at the 15th.<eos> They're here to help Elias, not back us up.<eos> What do you wanna do?<eos> Wait.<eos> Make sure this place is sealed off.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll do a sweep, and make sure it's airtight.
Come, quick! Something is floating there.<eos> Looks like a body!<eos> Mrs Lin!<eos> Is Mrs Lin home?<eos> Mrs Lin is home.<eos> Who's that?<eos> It's Zhong from the police station.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Uncle Tai just found... ...an overcoat on the seaside.<eos> I'd like you to take a look to see... ...if it's yours.

He should be having his break... ...at the tea restaurant now.<eos> It's his habit.<eos> Never miss a single day.<eos> Old chaps are like that.<eos> Did her sister ask you to look for her?<eos> No, it's Nan.<eos> He was here this morning.<eos> He asked me for the overcoat.<eos> It's the one Uncle Tai... ...found on the seaside two days ago.<eos> They thought it was Huixiang's.
This is my name card.<eos> I heard you found an overcoat on the seaside.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why are you interested in it?<eos> Nan is my good friend.<eos> I'm tracing something for him.<eos> I know Nan.<eos> I told the police about the overcoat.<eos> Nobody cared.<eos> Does it look familiar?

This I'm pretty sure.

Who is he?<eos> A mulatto.<eos> A brilliant soldier who heads the southern district.<eos> -I see.<eos> -He'll help us fight the rebels.<eos> Where are we on that front and who is Toussaint Louverture<eos> -that everyone's talking about? -A rebel leader.<eos> He entrenched himself in the Tannerie camp.<eos> Is Louverture his master's name?<eos> No, it refers to his bravery in combat.
No!<eos> Thieves!<eos> Listen, Parker, whatever it is, I'm sure you'll figure it out.<eos> I have faith in you.<eos> So, I mean, what --<eos> How's she doing?<eos> Apparently, dealing with some thieves.<eos> Aw, baby bird is learning how to fly. Oh.<eos> This place certainly served us well.<eos> Yes, it did.
And you can't spell "focus" without "us".<eos> Or FU.<eos> Hello, Sophie.<eos> Hello, Oleg.<eos> So, do you miss the sex?<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> We should go.<eos> No. We are having a conversation here.<eos> And besides, the sex was not that good.<eos> Oh, it was that good.
Scaring people into participating isn't success. It's Scientology.<eos> Calling Sophie we're taking that job.<eos> You'd better have a good reason you're late, because I managed to get here on time despite removing the disease pigeon feathers from my hair.<eos> I do.<eos> So today when we were cleaning up that apartment and I had my hands in a total stranger's toilet, I realized if we're really gonna be successful, we've got to think outside the bull.<eos> So after I thoroughly washed my hands,<eos> I know they never really come off though, right?<eos> Off your soul, I mean.<eos> I made a call to a connection I know and got us a real cupcake job.<eos> And it's in Manhattan.
Now go get some milk.<eos> No problem cause that's what waitresses do and apparently that's all we'll ever be.<eos> What?<eos> I have to prove the sex was not that good.<eos> Oleg on the food?<eos> Don't say it like that,<eos> That ham was already glaced before we go there.<eos> So I am guessing you are back together?<eos> Oh no no, the sex was not that good.<eos> Oh, it was that good.
Gentlemen.<eos> A break-in?<eos> At a player's home?<eos> Did you know anything about this?<eos> No.<eos> Fix it, Donnally.<eos> Fix it now. Or we're gonna find ourselves smack in the middle of a goddamn criminal investigation.<eos> And if Mr. Careles had a hand in this, he's history.<eos> Where'd you say the pain was, Mr. King?<eos> I didn't. It's in my back, and it's in my leg.
Let's say you get past them. Then you get to meet Chang's number one, Joshua.<eos> A 4-foot-10, 105-pound bucket of piss and zit cream.<eos> I cannot express to you how much I hate this kid.<eos> Now, beyond that dog-sneeze in a pair of Reeboks is a state-of-the-art keypad on the basement door.<eos> And just for extra fun, they change the code every day and the only copy is locked up in Chang's office.<eos> Now, just for a lark let's pretend you make it to the basement door.<eos> Who is there to greet you?<eos> Another guard and another lock to which there is only one key.<eos> And where is that key?<eos> Well, where is it?
Jeffrey!<eos> Oh, hey, Britta.<eos> How the Chang?<eos> I'm contaminated with plumber's acid, but they're coming back with a lotion.<eos> Sarcastic claps.<eos> Pretty clever.<eos> A plan that looked like it failed and then turned out to work.<eos> Too bad your real plan really failed.<eos> - What's so funny?<eos> - You idiot. The plan was for the plan to seem like it was failing.
They can be super-competitive, can also help skill development, or simply be just for fun.<eos> Being a small guy, it was important for me to get a jumpshot with range.<eos> So I designed a game, I called it the Sundance 15.<eos> I gave it my name.<eos> It had 15 spots, but the whole thing was that you would shoot all angles and distances.<eos> We used to play it for money.<eos> We used to play it for bragging rights, and we used to play it to work out.<eos> Specialty games have a ton of variations, from around the world to taps to knock-out, but the most universally recognised one is horse.<eos> In horse, a player attempts a shot.<eos> If made, the challenger has to hit it as well or get a letter on a miss.
I'm the guy who invented the crossover.<eos> I didn't even know that.<eos> But in my son's school, they was doing a report about basketball and the teacher called me and said, "I didn't know you invented the crossover."<eos> "Oscar Robertson said the first time he saw somebody do a crossover was Pee Wee Kirkland up at Rucker."<eos> The Big O. Could you imagine that?<eos> And I really took his change of pace, and just added sort of like a street flair to it.<eos> The next thing you know it was a crossover.<eos> And after me, here's another crossover, another crossover, and it just became the new wave of basketball.<eos> You see so many things in the NBA that they go crazy over that we did as kids.<eos> The sports announcer used to try to say that street basketball, it has no importance in the game. It's the origin of the game.
No matches in the system or to Mr. Pratt, but I did find some trace D.N.A.<eos> Are you writing this down?<eos> Yes.<eos> Castle.<eos> Okay, hang on.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Ooh. You are in trouble.<eos> I'm not in trouble.<eos> Lanie got a partial print.<eos> It is not a match for Pratt.
- Oh, that's wonderful.<eos> - Yay?<eos> - You are free to go. - Yes!<eos> Whoo!<eos> Thank you. That's...<eos> far enough.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Captain Green, you didn't by any chance happen to keep the Casandra Strickenberg, did you?<eos> My skirt.<eos> Ah. It was just about to be autoclaved.
Uh, can I get you another drink?<eos> Yeah...<eos> Keri.<eos> Would you like another mojito... the drink you first enjoyed on your trip to Cuba...<eos> [ Laughs ] Keri?<eos> I was thinking maybe we'd go back to my place for a drink.<eos> Let's do it. Sounds good.<eos> She was talking to me.<eos> You don't even know her name.<eos> It's Teri...
Yeah, we're good.<eos> I'm good.<eos> You're good.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Okay, 'cause, you know, it's nothing to be embarrassed about.<eos> It happens to a lot of guys.<eos> Well, it doesn't happen to me.<eos> It was probably just something you ate.<eos> You know, the body is a real mystery.<eos> Even scientists don't understand the way it works.
I just feel that our group could benefit from a more balanced approach.<eos> You know what I could benefit from?<eos> Those girls at the bar.<eos> It's not about women.<eos> It's about us.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> So, we're just supposed to be talking with no purpose?<eos> The purpose is to share our lives.<eos> For instance, Milo, how was your day?<eos> You know how it was.
Yeah! Come on!<eos> Help me move the shark backwards. - Pull! Pull!<eos> - Pull!<eos> - Is he dead?<eos> - Aah!<eos> - Pull! Pull!<eos> - Get it off me! - No! He's dying!<eos> - Pull!<eos> The shark is slowing down. I think it's drowning.<eos> Oh, my God. Is it dead?
Do we trust him to go on a search alone?<eos> Yeah, what if he's helping tiburon?<eos> You know, it seems like he knows more about why we're here than we do.<eos> - What's the difference?<eos> - You can go with him if you'd like, but I'm fine right here. Yeah.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> I'm fine here, too.<eos> Look, now we know what to expect.<eos> We just have to outsmart the shark before it gets one of us.
So what do you think it'll be this time?<eos> The trap, or the shark?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I meant the trap, but now I mean both.<eos> There's no way of knowing, and nothing we could do even if we did.<eos> Just keep your eyes open.<eos> Tiburon could spring it on us at any moment.<eos> As long as Frankie's got that knife, we got a chance.<eos> Let's keep moving.<eos> There it is.
We have to face it.<eos> But I need you to get to shore.<eos> I promised you're gonna live.<eos> I'll get to the shore, and then I'll distract the shark so you can come over.<eos> That's the plan.<eos> Cal!<eos> No!<eos> Ragan.<eos> I got it.<eos> You did? Is it really dead?
I'm listening.<eos> Bressler has been pounding the war drum to take a more aggressive posture toward the aliens.<eos> Okay.<eos> Built his army, and now he wants to pull the trigger.<eos> But he's right about wanting to get into the fight.<eos> It's the only way we're gonna beat them.<eos> I understand that, of course.<eos> I hope so, Arthur, because as comfortable as this all is, nobody's really safe until the aliens are gone.<eos> It's just not the time.<eos> It's taken months, but we've created the first city-state in the new America, and I want to nurture it.
I want to read you something that a friend of mine wrote about a different war.<eos> "There were some who advocated accommodation,<eos> "who believed the enemy would only be enraged "by outright rebellion.<eos> "But they were outnumbered<eos> "by those who understood that freedom would only come once the enemy had been driven from their land."<eos> That was written by Arthur Manchester.<eos> About the American struggle against the British during our revolution.<eos> But he might as well have been writing about today.<eos> Yeah! I've met our enemy.<eos> I've seen what it's done to our children.
I don't know him.<eos> But there's so many of us now.<eos> I'm to tell you there's been a development with the Overlords, and there isn't much time.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> The one with the red eye -- the leader of the rebellion.<eos> He's waiting nearby so you can talk. I'll take you to him when you're ready.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Gentlemen, come, come.<eos> They could be right outside the door.<eos> If they wanted to attack this place, it'd be on fire by now.
Let's be partners.<eos> It's over, CLAY.<eos> You like killing for pleasure.<eos> Not me.<eos> You take the blame... and a fucking burn.<eos> Mr. Hasumi...<eos> Vincent has done an unfortunate thing.<eos> As you can see suicide.<eos> There's even a will.<eos> It's real.
Yes, sir.<eos> Greetings.<eos> Today's unexpected news from this unexpected source was surprising.<eos> I am putting no one at fault.<eos> Each temple has authority to reach its own decisions.<eos> But my brothers, ponder the effects of a robot's awakening on us.<eos> What meaning can it hold for our brothers elsewhere?<eos> What robot is desirous or compulsive by nature?<eos> Are robots created without such desires, for the sole purpose of serving man?<eos> If we were to acknowledge a robot as Buddha... if it were constructed inherent with enlightenment, which so few attain after such struggle and denial of self, who would bear the countless cycles of death and birth to achieve it?
That's the thing-- it doesn't feel like it.<eos> I'm just being honest.<eos> I can't ask for more than that, except rational thought.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Ring, ring.<eos> - Hi, it's Glenn Fisher.<eos> Glenn, this is Margaret Jordan.<eos> I'm an associate producer at "News Night" and I'm doing the preinterview for the governor's appearance this evening.<eos> I know Will's gonna wanna ask why mean people tend to pour into your state like it's a bathtub drain.
Listen, there's no one here but me and you.<eos> Is this something you want or something you got talked into?<eos> It's-- no, it's something I want badly.<eos> - I've wanted this since the dawn of time.<eos> - More than numbers?<eos> Weren't you the one that told me that your audience are your only friends?<eos> I said that after a couple of shots of some kind of varnish remover at a particularly low point in my life.<eos> - That was two weeks ago.<eos> - It was a very low point.<eos> - I think it was lower than three weeks ago.
when I die, bury me here.<eos> What?<eos> Don't say stuff like that!<eos> Everyone dies.<eos> But still...<eos> It's not for a long time.<eos> Go to your bed!<eos> Get out!<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> Go water the tree. It'll wither to death.
I will, if it comes to that.<eos> So, do we take a vote?<eos> Why?<eos> We sound great.<eos> Rock on, man.<eos> Solid.<eos> That Yamaha's got a real nice touch.<eos> You like the sound?<eos> It's huge, huh?<eos> Yeah, it's real nice, but we're looking for something else today.
On the other hand, if they tell you to jump, you don't ask what for, you jump.<eos> Now, you need a name for them?<eos> You call them "yes, sir" and "no, sir."<eos> You got any problems, you come to me.<eos> Here's the deal...<eos> The finishing tank's a tight fit.<eos> And with this motor you've got here on top--<eos> The agitation motor.<eos> The agitation motor here on top, the tank's not gonna fit in the box.<eos> It's just, uh-- it's just too tall.
I'm not going to prison and have my daughter raised in a group home.<eos> Do you have any idea what those places are like?<eos> I gave him a list of names but instead of handling it, he's protecting them.<eos> So I hired someone else.<eos> At that point, there was no option but to add Mike to the list.<eos> This ocean of methylamine that you claim you can get your hands on how much are we talking about, literally?<eos> How does 24,000 gallons sound?<eos> Once a week, on a Wednesday, a freight train leaves the Port of Long Beach loaded with industrial chemicals.<eos> There's always at least one tanker car full of methylamine which we import from a manufacturer in Guangzhou.<eos> The train travels east through Arizona stops at a rail yard outside Flagstaff where it gets broken down and rebuilt.
It's because of your nine guys in lockup, right?<eos> You broke it, you pay for it.<eos> And we've talked about this plenty already.<eos> Well, maybe we better talk about it a little more because what it sounds like you're telling me, Mike, is that from now on we have no choice but to do this piddling pseudo cook so that we can pay back your guys.<eos> Or else what?<eos> Or else they're gonna rat on us, and we end up in prison.<eos> And it sounds like what you're telling me, Walter is that you wanna do this heist even if it means killing a couple of innocent men.<eos> That what you want?<eos> You know, I don't know why you insist on putting words in my mouth here.<eos> What if we can rip off that train, and no one ever knows it got robbed?
All right.<eos> - You mind if I ask you a question?<eos> - No. Go ahead.<eos> Well, I get why we want the tank for the methylamine.<eos> But why this other one for the water?<eos> Well...<eos> Jesse, it's your idea.<eos> You wanna fill him in?<eos> It's all about the weight, yo.<eos> The tanker we're gonna hit gets weighed when it gets loaded in Long Beach and then again when it's unloaded in Texas.
Where's the juice?<eos> The methylamine isn't coming.<eos> Why is that?<eos> And who the hell are you?<eos> I'm the man who's keeping it.<eos> What the hell's this?<eos> We had an agreement, right?<eos> We got our deal.<eos> - So where's the tank, Mike?<eos> - Mike doesn't know where it is.
out of options. So think of me as the light at the end of your tunnel.<eos> The last port in your personal storm of hopelessness and despair.<eos> I am ready, willing, and able to help Evan Cross kick some alien ass.<eos> Prehistoric ass.<eos> Even better.<eos> Is the kid still missing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Name's Trevor Molison.<eos> I'm allowed access, but the rest of you, no.<eos> They think a bear is responsible for the attacks, and it's still in the park.
For 30 years, I've been hearing it's a handball injury, but it always seems to get worse with stress.<eos> Maybe it's that audit he's got comin' up.<eos> - Audit?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Oh, isn't that cute?<eos> He doesn't want you to worry.<eos> Here's your sandwich. Now you should worry.<eos> Look at it. My prettiest child.<eos> Why didn't you tell me about your neck?<eos> it's fine. Take a bite.
Oh, yeah.<eos> - 'Cause you're really blinking.<eos> I'm a stress blinker.<eos> Um, and what really gets me going is confrontation. Hate it.<eos> I-l avoid it at all costs.<eos> Terrible at it. Once, I-l, uh<eos> - I tried to break up with a girl, and I danced around it so much, she didn't know I had broken up with her.<eos> Twenty years later, we're still married.<eos> I am ... really sorry ... about the cold coffee.<eos> It's not that cold. it's lukewarm, so- Okay, so
You're here to congratulate me.<eos> I knew it.<eos> It was Hardman, wasn't it?<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I know how it is around here. Secrets and lies-- standard procedure.<eos> I didn't build the sandbox, Zoe.<eos> No, you just like to play in it.<eos> - And you don't?<eos> - No. And I don't like watching what it's doing to a man I care about.
No record of any "Sadie" committing suicide in Boston in the last two years.<eos> Maybe Slater made her up for dramatic effect.<eos> Yeah, like that guy on "Oprah" that wrote that fake memoir.<eos> - "Oprah"?<eos> - What, I can't have a sensitive side?<eos> Maybe Slater changed Sadie's name so he wouldn't get sued.<eos> Oh, he did.<eos> "Names have been changed to protect the not-so-innocent."<eos> Frost, look up Slater's 911 call for his attempted suicide two years ago.<eos> See if it's still in the system.
Louis said I'm not allowed to prioritize your work anymore.<eos> You think I'm taking orders from Louis now?<eos> Consider things status quo.<eos> Yeah, well, they aren't.<eos> They are as far as you and I are concerned.<eos> I give you work, and you're gonna do it.<eos> Oh, right, I forgot.<eos> That's how it works with us.<eos> Don't pout. You're gonna love this case.<eos> It's very detail-oriented.
Just ask, okay?<eos> Sir...<eos> I apologize for the mess with Ben Matheson.<eos> I didn't mean for the man to die.<eos> Drop the formalities, Tom.<eos> We've been friends too long for that.<eos> I'm promoting you to major.<eos> How would you like to head up intelligence and interrogations?<eos> You've been angling for that job for years.<eos> Now it's yours, if you want it.
Just go to your computer.<eos> I've sent you a link.<eos> Am I going to hate this?<eos> Not as much as Matt.<eos> Oh, Christ!<eos> And plaid? What is he thinking?<eos> !<eos> Let's just hope he doesn't see this.<eos> This hummus is wonderful.<eos> It's not too... hummus-y.
The truth is...<eos> The truth is that you made a mistake during a surgery that cost a patient his life.<eos> It takes years of study to become a surgeon, not to mention tremendous ego.<eos> Surgeons don't just leave to become addict-sitters. They're forced out. And they're only forced out if they commit the sin of malpractice.<eos> I knew it would be a sore subject so I made up the bit about your friend to spare your feelings.<eos> That was very big of you.<eos> How do you know the patient died?<eos> How do you know I didn't just leave him paralyzed or in a coma?<eos> The parking ticket! The one you had in your purse.<eos> It was...
You wanted to take it, but you couldn't, could you?<eos> 'Cause you couldn't find it.<eos> He laundered it, you see?<eos> Left it in his pocket when he put his trousers in the wash.<eos> But the time he realized, it was too late.<eos> The phone that he'd turned into a virtual library of his therapy sessions was no longer functional.<eos> Furious with himself and suffering the effects of what he couldn't possibly have known was steroid intoxication, he destroyed the washer in a fit of rage.<eos> And then he went to the nearest grocer's and purchased a bag of rice.<eos> Rice, as you're apparently not aware, is a natural desiccant.<eos> It can be used to absorb moisture from electronic devices that have been immersed in water.
I have lung cancer.<eos> Stage four.<eos> I'm thinking about suicide.<eos> It's nice of you, Gerard.<eos> Hello, Miss. I am so happy.<eos> I caught a cold, but it's better now.<eos> - They are...<eos> - Working, yes.<eos> To feel the pain come back. It is so acute; it cannot be endured anymore.<eos> It should stop, and yet it should continue.

- Hey, I think kissing is more intimate than sex.<eos> It fools you.<eos> That's why people shouldn't kiss unless they want to show an emotional connection.<eos> I guess that's why hookers don't kiss.<eos> You're bi-curious.<eos> You understand hookers.<eos> If I didn't know how this ends, I would ask you out.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - How was your day, Doctor?<eos> It's about to get much better, whatever you call a person with a master's degree.
I know that for sure.<eos> Then I need your help finding out who it is.<eos> I need a name and I need a 20. 'Cause I got to shut this shit down.<eos> I'll see what I can find out.<eos> 50.<eos> Half of our last mule.<eos> You're an impressive young man.<eos> Yeah, I get that a lot.<eos> I got a proposal for you and SAMCRO.<eos> Does it involve children and bonfires?
- Seemed like the right thing to do.<eos> - Good for you.<eos> Tell Otto I say hi.<eos> Hope that saves his soul.<eos> Thanks for coming... bringing this.<eos> Anything you need, Mom.<eos> What's so urgent?<eos> I got a little disturbing news the other day I wanted to... bounce off my Mexican brethren.<eos> It turns out there was this RICO case, right?<eos> It was about to come crashing down on all of us.

Find out where they took it.<eos> I'll buy it back.<eos> It might be... in a container on a boat, on its way to a girl's school in Gwandara, Nigeria.

That's the spirit.<eos> You ready?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - All right.<eos> How does this work?<eos> Okay, this cane's a couple of inches too tall for you.<eos> So choke down a little bit.<eos> You're gonna hold it waist high, about a foot in front of your body.<eos> Think of it as an extension of your index finger, but it should be underneath the shaft.
Watch it! I said onto the cutout, not into the street.<eos> - Sorry, I thought that--<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> Just take a breath.<eos> Very good.<eos> Now, here are the ground rules.<eos> You are gonna have to lean into your other senses.<eos> Listening is everything.<eos> I want you to feel the ground with your feet.<eos> It'll tell you everything that you need to know.
You know what, Arthur?<eos> You're gonna make a great politician.<eos> Mmm. It's pretty good.<eos> My, um-- my father was a dear friend to Prime Minister Halabi, and when my parents died, he took me in.<eos> I was 12 years old.<eos> I remember, not long after I moved into the palace, a small bird hit the bedroom window and injured its wing.<eos> The Prime Minister, he had falcons for some time, so he knew something about birds.<eos> So he taught me how to repair the wing and nurse the bird back to health.<eos> And I remember asking him every day if we can let the bird go, and he said something to me I'll never forget.<eos> He said it would be cruel to let the bird go too soon, that it would surely die on its own, being weak and unable to fly and that just because I want the bird to be free doesn't mean that it's ready.

A woman sat here quite recently.<eos> None of your people, of course.<eos> This is an active crime scene, and knowing you, Captain, they know better.<eos> That leaves the shooter.<eos> Go on.<eos> The second crime, the robbery, was committed by a man.<eos> A very strong man judging by the items he removed from the apartment.<eos> How strong does a guy have to be to steal a wallet and a watch?<eos> You're forgetting the armoire.<eos> Dust patterns on the wall and the floor tell us it stood here, as do these scratches on the floor.

And when the drug wears off, you have no recollection of what happened.<eos> Is it possible somebody slipped Kyle that drug?<eos> I think it's highly probable that they did.<eos> What time do you think he was given the scopolamine?<eos> Between 2:45 and 3:45 the night of the murder.<eos> That's when he was on that zombie walk.<eos> Someone on the zombie walk drugged Kyle and sent him after David.<eos> Kyle's innocent.<eos> Far from a random active of zombie mayhem, this murder was fiendishly deliberate.<eos> It was meticulously planned...
Monday, then.<eos> Clear your calendar, 'cause we have a date at the courthouse.<eos> The convention's still happening tomorrow if you want to go.<eos> That whole city on the brink of destruction thing kind of took the wind out of my sails, you know?<eos> That'll do it every time.<eos> We didn't finish the inspection.<eos> No need.<eos> What happened?<eos> Um, there is a horizontal crack in the foundation.<eos> It just weakens the entire base that the house is sitting on. Yeah.
It's electrified.<eos> Whatareyou doing with them?<eos> Atthemoment,just keeping them comfortable.<eos> There's no point in torturing them, they won't give Derek up.<eos> The instinct to protect their Alpha's too strong.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what are you doing with me?<eos> Because Scott can find me, all right?<eos> He knows my scent.<eos> It's pungent, you know?
The other half is like a freaking nightmare.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I can help him.<eos> See, that's the problem.<eos> You don't care about getting hurt.<eos> But you know how I'll feel?<eos> I'll be devastated.<eos> And if you die, I will literally go out of my freakin' mind.<eos> You see, death doesn't happen to you, Lydia.<eos> It happens to everyone around you, okay?
It didn't work.<eos> None of it, none of it worked.<eos> Well, I wouldn't say that.<eos> In fact, I'd say the prognosis isn't nearly as dire as it seems.<eos> Not nearly.<eos> You really think it's a good idea being here?<eos> I just want to know her name.<eos> It was Kara.<eos> Kara Simmons.<eos> It's not here.
Unfortunately, I can't.<eos> At least not yet.<eos> Are you real?<eos> Interestingly... that question can also be. Answered, "not yet."<eos> I promise everything's going to get back to normal, Lydia.<eos> All that you have to do... Is every single thing I ask.<eos> Timing is key here, Lydia.<eos> It all needs to happen by the next full moon.<eos> Do you know what they call the full moon in march?<eos> It's called the worm moon.
Yeah.<eos> All right, that should do it.<eos> You really thought I would do this using prescription pills.<eos> According to gender statistics, most women... but you're not most women.<eos> I'll go upstairs and write the letter.<eos> Don't hesitate because of Allison.<eos> She'll feel the ground shifting beneath her feet time and again in her life.<eos> It is our job to teach her how to keep standing.<eos> The ground isn't shifting.<eos> It's crumbling.
She erased my life.<eos> Amanda did this to me and I want to know why.<eos> Why don't you help me find her?<eos> We'll ask her in person.<eos> Did you have a pleasant trip?<eos> Caught a show, saw a few friends.<eos> I was surprised when Omri told me you'd flown to New York.<eos> I have a present for you.<eos> The cryptograph.<eos> So Mr. Elliot really did know where it was?
I saw you play.<eos> You were good, dad.<eos> You're always good.<eos> You can go now, okay?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Played a hell of a game tonight, your dad.<eos> You should be proud of him.<eos> Were you messing with me?<eos> When did I ever lie about a grift?<eos> All right, so, tell -- tell me where it is.
When did I ever lie about a grift?<eos> All right, so, tell -- tell me where it is.<eos> Oh, there's Vlad.<eos> Busiak?<eos> Vladimir Busiak was your partner?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, maybe I should have said he played some hockey.<eos> "Played some hockey"? He's in the hall of fame!<eos> You didn't steal the cup.<eos> It's been in his living room three different times.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that's great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks, there, Vlad.<eos> The question is when?<eos> Tonight.<eos> Tonight?<eos> You think you can come up with a plan?<eos> Already have.<eos> It's in one of my contingencies. Okay.
And here we go.<eos> The puck is deflected by Raymondjack, and the freeze take early control.<eos> Marko looks like a shark with blood in the water.<eos> Somebody call a doctor. There's Labert again using Franco like he's a toboggan.<eos> Labert is a man possessed tonight, and he's jawing at every freeze player he makes contact with.<eos> Let's face it off.<eos> Come on, Duffy!<eos> Downey and Marko ready for the face-off.<eos> Puck controlled by the otters.<eos> No, it's stolen by Veach.
But what about your career?<eos> Are you asking for me or the team?<eos> I'm asking for you.<eos> Terrence, you got to know that, in your absence, the Hawks are scouting receivers.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's football for you.<eos> That's how it goes.<eos> I mean, I got my signing check.<eos> I don't need the nonsense of football.<eos> It's just full of pain and agony and pressure and disloyalty.
I'm telling you, that girl became Root.<eos> Amazing.<eos> We've managed to perfect the apple... a genetically modified version that never goes brown.<eos> And yet, we still haven't upgraded human beings.<eos> The human race has stalled out, Harold.<eos> And from what I've seen, most of it is rotten to the core.<eos> Harold, generous to a fault.<eos> Always letting someone else take credit for your work.<eos> I'd recognize your code anywhere.<eos> It's so... elegant.
Where's the machine?<eos> This time, it is loaded.<eos> Now, where did you move the machine?<eos> I'm telling you, I don't know.<eos> Wait.<eos> July 12, 2009, it was boxed up and put on a train.<eos> With that amount of servers, of course it was a train.<eos> - But a train to where?<eos> - It started in Des Moines.<eos> Then it was transferred to Union Pacific railway, bound for Salt Lake City.
We all deal with grief differently, Detective.<eos> How are you dealing with yours?<eos> Find my son's killer, and you'll see.<eos> George, when was the last time you saw Eddie?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> We had lunch, came back here.<eos> Any idea what he was doing out so late last night or with whom?<eos> Couldn't say.<eos> He received a call shortly before the crash.<eos> Was it from you?
Take this to your future bride.<eos> Sleepy time tea...<eos> always calms her down.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sometimes I find it's helpful to drop an ambien in, just to make sure crazy goes night-night.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Nobody gains weight in prison!<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Brought you your tea.<eos> Put an ice cube in there so it's not so hot, in case you spill it or it gets thrown.
Got it, dad.<eos> I got it. It's so frustrating because...<eos> I know I can't run Haley's like for her, but if she would let me, I would be so good at it.<eos> Right, 'cause parents always know what's best for their kids.<eos> You remember that nice girl at the office I tried to fix Mitch up with?<eos> No offense, dad, but I think I probably have a better sense of what my kids need than you did.<eos> I think it's cute you think that. Mom!<eos> It was so awesome!<eos> The jeep was jerking around... And--and there was a lot of sharp turns and big drops. Uh-huh.<eos> Uh-huh. It just kept going.
Number one:<eos> there's no feeding on humans in Fangtasia.<eos> Number fuckin' two:<eos> get out of my maker's throne before I stake you all over it.<eos> Monarchs have lifted the ban on public feeding.<eos> And Northman is history.<eos> The Authority has named me the new Sheriff of Area 5.<eos> Everybody, grab a human.<eos> Is Hoyt gonna be okay?<eos> He had a pulse, but it was real weak.
They didn't have the, uh, Asiago cheese or "Gryer" when I went to the market, so...<eos> It's "Gruyere," Uncle Danny.<eos> Gruyere, Gryer, whatever.<eos> All they had was the cheese in a can, so I used that.<eos> - In a can.<eos> - What?<eos> Canned cheese?<eos> Come on.<eos> Cheese is cheese!<eos> What? Not if it's in a can.
Ma'am, with all due respect, you're a wee bit older than that hottie.<eos> For God sakes.<eos> You know, here I am, on national TV every day, and still a guy who spends his whole life sitting next to a giant picture of me has no idea who I am.<eos> This isn't my whole life;<eos> I'm in a band.<eos> And we're gonna make it.<eos> And, kids, they did make it.<eos> But I'll get to that later.<eos> You know what, I'm probably not going to get to that later.<eos> They had one song, it didn't suck, the end.
You know what, Watson?<eos> I take it all back.<eos> I'm beginning to find the chatter that accompanies your companionship extremely useful.<eos> A bit like white noise.<eos> It puts me in a state where I think, and I observe better.<eos> What?<eos> If this is your idea of a brown van, then you're even more sleep-deprived than I thought.<eos> Note the parking tickets.<eos> Hmm? It's been here for days.<eos> Yet there are small skid marks beneath each tire, indicating it's been moved several inches.
That means he works nights.<eos> It doesn't sound like much, I know, but it's more than we previously knew about him.<eos> And you think you can run with that?<eos> From a drop of water, a logician can infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of either one.<eos> I've got my drop of water.<eos> Now allow me to infer.<eos> He worked nights-- you think that's really going to be enough to identify the Balloon Man?<eos> Of course not, but it's a start.<eos> Our previous suspect pool included virtually every man in the city.<eos> Now it's been reduced to every man who works nights.
It's not like that.<eos> Didn't know him that well.<eos> We did a joint task force together eight years ago.<eos> Haven't seen him since.<eos> Why'd he call you?<eos> That's the million- dollar question.<eos> He's got a dog?<eos> Big-ass poodle.<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> It's in the bathroom.
Whoever did this has got mad skills.<eos> If someone wanted to make it look like a suicide, why blow the door?<eos> Nothing's adding up.<eos> Start looking at street cams just outside the area where the transformer blew.<eos> Hello.<eos> Um, you look...<eos> Sleepy.<eos> He was gonna say "beautiful."<eos> Okay, well, um... the recorded call you received, it came from a message service.<eos> It was a fail-safe.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - How you feeling?<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> I just want to get out of here.<eos> - What did the doctors say?<eos> - Not a whole lot.<eos> They said I looked pretty good for a girl who's been in a coma for three days.<eos> And what about that scratch?<eos> They don't seem to think it's a big deal.
And it's out on the street now?<eos> I didn't have a lot of choice.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're okay.<eos> Me too.<eos> Should we go look?<eos> No.<eos> Right. There's cleaning up to do there.<eos> Hey, I'll make you a deal.<eos> I'll help you clean up if you take a break and... well, I was up in my attic, and I-I found my great-grandmother's old picnic basket?<eos> It's like a beauty from the early '20s, I think?
It's my job to protect her.<eos> When she got hit off the track.<eos> Let's go back to that moment.<eos> [ Voice breaking ] She's gone. I can't see her.<eos> Tell me how you feel when you can't see her.<eos> [ Gasping ] It's all my fault.<eos> The -- the smell.<eos> Okay. The same smell?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's so strong.
[ Gasping ] It's all my fault.<eos> The -- the smell.<eos> Okay. The same smell?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's so strong.<eos> That's good. Just stay with it.<eos> Grace, tell me what it smells like.<eos> Sweet.<eos> But it's like a chemical.<eos> It's overpowering.
Hospital Transport to Vascular Imaging.<eos> Infusing with dopamine... two mcg.<eos> - (Phone ringing) - Portable X ray to ER2. Portable X ray to ER2.<eos> McCOMBS: You really think you're Martin Odum?<eos> There is no Martin Odum.<eos> Everything about him is fake.<eos> EVANS: We all got the same thing.<eos> They did something to us over there, man.<eos> SONYA: I know your name.<eos> It's Martin MacDonald Odum.
Dude, you have a gun.<eos> I can't shoot everybody.<eos> Plus, I used pepper spray on this kid the other day, turns out he was a skalengeck. Had no effect.<eos> Skalengeck.<eos> He probably enjoyed it.<eos> Yeah, this definitely would've done the trick, but how are you gonna explain all this stuff to Hank?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Check it out.<eos> The first bolt is meant to slow the attacker down.<eos> You fill it with hellebore extract.
You getting this, Crane?<eos> I got it. Turners hard drive cloned.<eos> Calling Keel now.<eos> Well?<eos> False alarm.<eos> Nobody's copied our bid.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> The laptop hasn't been touched.<eos> The file can't be cloned unless the hard drive's powered up.<eos> It's powered up now, isn't it?
Could you take me to your prom?<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> I mean, if you go off to college and you don't come back here, I want you to remember me.<eos> I wanna be your Angela Wilkins.<eos> - Mom? - Yes.<eos> Can I borrow that purple dress I said you were too old for?<eos> Mm, in spite of that, yeah. Yeah.<eos> - Hey, buddy. - Mr. D.<eos> Do you have a tuxedo I could borrow?<eos> I mean, it's the tux I got married in, so it's double-breasted.
Actually, she's my mom.<eos> And I have a feeling she can take care of herself.<eos> And I get it. You're not the only one who's been screwing up lately.<eos> What kind of corset is this?<eos> Up here!<eos> Is that it?<eos> Yeah. That's our home.<eos> Where's the lake?<eos> You're looking at it.<eos> It's gone.
Yes, you will.<eos> Lancelot, does a disgraced member of the round table still have the power to perform a wedding?<eos> It would be my honor.<eos> In my kingdom, there is legend of a cup that has the power to grant eternal life.<eos> And so may the love between you always be strong, true, and eternal.<eos> Good-bye, mother.<eos> Where's the "on" switch?<eos> It's more complicated than that.<eos> We'll have to get it back to the island.<eos> Hopefully, someone there has access to enough magic to make it work again.
She doesn't have the right to always put herself in danger.<eos> I was scared when I was a child and I still am. - She's like a child!<eos> - That's true.<eos> Why didn't you prevent her from doing this job?<eos> - It's impossible to do that with your mum.<eos> You can't change someone you love.<eos> Even if you'd like to.<eos> I've often been scared for her too.<eos> But... this job is her passion.<eos> It's part of her life.
I know, I told the girls to be quiet.<eos> On the contrary, no catlike stealth, no soft music and no whispering, she hates it.<eos> Alright.<eos> That's for the best.<eos> I hope you brought your coats. Yes.<eos> Where's the old lady who's going to die?<eos> Here she is!<eos> - Alright, your turn. - No!<eos> There are holes in your hat.<eos> It's like me, still pretty but not on every level.
We got a body. Rachel Lawson, 25.<eos> Grad student in Earth and planetary sciences.<eos> Now I feel sorry for her, too.<eos> Where's the body?<eos> - It's down there.<eos> - How long she been there?<eos> Looked like a couple of days, but you could ask ...<eos> Relax, Frost. I'll ask Dr. Isles.<eos> Victim rented a car.<eos> It's parked outside.
Did you ever return my "guns of the world digest"?<eos> I always return things I borrow.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Of course I'm sure.<eos> Maybe you lost it.<eos> You do lo things.<eos> [ Sighs ]<eos> Has Dr. pike been sitting in my chair?<eos> Could be. Why?<eos> Is it broken?
What makes you think that I'm just gonna let y'all walk out of here?<eos> I'm tired, had a hard few months, eaten a lot of jell-o, discovering -- don't want to be doing this anymore.<eos> Whole reason I hired you.<eos> I'm really grateful you're gonna let us go, so I'd like to offer you these -- prescription pain-killers.<eos> There's a few left.<eos> I don't want pills.<eos> That shit's addictive.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> What you think of her cane?<eos> It's simple... but festive.
Make appointments.<eos> Map your route.<eos> Go get 'em!<eos> What are you so happy about?<eos> I get to go to work today.<eos> You like your job?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I only left it for two minutes.<eos> I was in the baggage claim waiting on my niece.<eos> Sir, if you leave your car unattended in the red zone, it will get towed.
Try not to, Mr Fowkes.<eos> Tumer claims that Polyhedrus is using the Chinese as a front, buying the dam on its behalf.<eos> He says he has evidence that will stop the sale.<eos> But we don't know what it is.<eos> FOWKES: No, but we have a fair idea where it is.<eos> In that case that he gave Dave Ryder.<eos> That bloody case.<eos> Curse of my life.<eos> You need to find it.<eos> It's not at the club, not any more, I can tell you that much.
- I don't know.<eos> Just make sure you're not in the car when they leave the party.<eos> Don't tell me you're upset about Jack Turner.<eos> It's not Jack.<eos> It's...<eos> That little boy has been through hell.<eos> You care about him, don't you?<eos> What about the case?<eos> You're to retrieve it immediately after.<eos> So he thinks it must be in a wall safe here.
Sam?<eos> Sam, can you hear me?<eos> Sam?<eos> You're late.<eos> It's okay, He'll be okay.<eos> I remember.<eos> (WHISPERING) I remember<eos> Good morning, Mr Keel.<eos> I'm afraid I don't know your name.<eos> Only that it isn't Horst Goebel.
We're getting out.<eos> Get back in the car.<eos> Yes?<eos> Change of plan.<eos> Meet me at Suleymaniye now.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> Suleymaniye.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Hands on your head!<eos> It's empty.
I'm not sure.<eos> Maybe that if we saw this through together... if we finally stopped Nazir once and for all... then you'd be a real hero.<eos> And that fact... would somehow make everything you did before not matter.<eos> That it would all just be about getting... to there.<eos> Including what I did to you?<eos> Including that.<eos> Just wouldn't matter anymore- to either of us.<eos> You know how crazy everyone says you are?<eos> You're crazier than that.<eos> This deal of ours- I think it's a way out for both of us.
We're preparing to test the prototype.<eos> Keep those eyes on us.<eos> Sophie, should we be helping these people?<eos> You have to decide that for yourself.<eos> I won't be a part of it.<eos> Engineering, conn.<eos> Stand ready to engage the Perseus prototype.<eos> Aye-aye, sir.<eos> The prototype is tied in to every major system on the sub.<eos> It goes down, we're done.
Drink it.<eos> It will feel just like a dream.<eos> It's just like wearing new clothes in a dream.<eos> No!<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> From this moment on<eos> you are the most beautiful woman in the world.<eos> No man will be able to resist your charm.<eos> To have you, they'll be willing to do or say anything...<eos> You must return here within 12 hours to wear your own skin, or it will flake into a thousand pieces...
I want you alive because I want you to suffer like I did.<eos> Killing me is gonna take a lot more than that, dearie.<eos> Even demons can be killed.<eos> I will find a way. Well, good luck living long enough.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, please stop.<eos> What are you doing? Sending you on a little ride under the town line.<eos> Once you cross, you'll forget who you were in the other realm and who you loved.<eos> This should help you find the key.<eos> I left it at the bottom of the cart.
I know you're angry. But, man, you got to fight this thing.<eos> Do not do this!<eos> Just let it go.<eos> Come on, Dean.<eos> Goodbye, Sam.<eos> God!<eos> Garth, don't!<eos> It's cool.<eos> It's all good. I'm cool.<eos> It took me forever to melt that penny, but it's finally gone.
Lemon, I know what I want.<eos> I want this boat.<eos> (chuckles)<eos> Hey, Lavon.<eos> Old pal! You okay?<eos> That was the newspaper... wanting a quote about my getting busted for shoplifting.<eos> Oh, when this hits the stands tomorrow, I can, I can forget about the Owl Club endorsement.<eos> In fact, I can forget about the election.<eos> Okay, okay, first, there's only one newsstand.<eos> It would be very easy for an "accident" to take it out.
And you were paired with the Skitters.<eos> Imagine 10 times that.<eos> Can I get some more bread?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um...<eos> We think we've come up with something -- well, Lourdes, actually.<eos> Uh, well, it really started with the Captain being hypothermic, which is his body temperature has been dropping.<eos> Which didn't make any sense since the normal reaction to an infection is an elevated temperature, a fever.<eos> But that's not what's happening here.<eos> So we wondered if the pathogen needed a cooler host environment to survive, which is why it's moving through the capillary system nearest to the surface of the skin.
It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Well, the idea is simple enough.<eos> We pump blood... out of Captain Weaver into this chamber, where we heat it up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit, which, in theory, should kill whatever it is that's in the Captain's bloodstream.<eos> And then we pump it into this second chamber where we cool it back down to normal body temperature, 98.6 degrees.<eos> And then we pump it back into his body.<eos> How long's this gonna take?<eos> Eight hours, more or less.<eos> You said he could die by then.<eos> If we can reverse the process, if we can get the pathogen to recede before it attacks the blood brain barrier,
A Murcielago Matraca.<eos> Looks like some kind of hand-crank siren.<eos> Apparently...<eos> Yeah, it wreaks havoc with their ultrasonic sound waves, negating their ability to, you know, blow out your eyes.<eos> Have you seen anything like that before?<eos> Actually, I think I have.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> God, there is some amazing stuff in this trailer.<eos> Do you have this place insured?<eos> Well, that would mean having to admit that it existed, so...
- This is what they do with the bodies they can't harvest.<eos> They burn them.<eos> It's why there are so few real accounts.<eos> - No, Wesley, it's horrible what happened to your mom, but this is not aliens.<eos> - My grandfather showed me the photographs.<eos> - Wesley, do not do this!<eos> (loud noise) - What the hell is that?<eos> - They're here.<eos> - Are you sure this plan is gonna work, Wesley?<eos> - It was my grandfather's. It's a... it's pretty ancient, so keep your fingers crossed.
- Let me guess.<eos> Playing sock puppet with Amanda again?<eos> - Can I help?<eos> - I've got everything under control.<eos> But thank you, really.<eos> Nolan, I found something you need to look at.<eos> Oh.<eos> Another love letter from the I.R.S.?<eos> No.<eos> It's from your father's estate attorney.
What is this trick?<eos> Is it sawing a lady in half?<eos> Well, not sawing.<eos> But actually, the Magician's Code forbids me from telling you anything else about the trick.<eos> Wayne, come back to bed!<eos> Okay, it involves a bed.<eos> W-W-Wait.<eos> Can you at least tell me the name of this trick?<eos> Sure, kid.<eos> It's called--
It's only three 14-hour days.<eos> So on our romantic getaway to help me forget about you skipping town on me, you're skipping town on me?<eos> ! Look Quinn, you're very important to me, but you're sharing my heart with an equally important Miss.<eos> Miss...<eos> What?<eos> H...<eos> Shoot him.<eos> So what did you order?<eos> Oh, just black coffee.<eos> I like it that way, too. Yeah, it just tastes better to me.
They're unlike the one I suggested.<eos> Yes, but I don't think they're worse.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> -No, maybe not.<eos> -What about her first novel?<eos> I'd love to have it translated.<eos> No, I don't think I'm the right person for the job.<eos> It's so...<eos> To be perfectly honest.<eos> I find it a little... A little young.
I find a big cock even more erotic.<eos> If you're going to be vulgar, I'd just as soon you not speak at all.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can be classy, if you want.<eos> It's just that most men like to hear me talk dirty.<eos> Of all the composers from the Romantic Era... I love Chopin the most.<eos> Oh. Are you familiar with this waltz?<eos> No...<eos> "Les Adieux."<eos> It was inspired by his childhood sweetheart who refused his hand in marriage.
Since 1949, when you had a calling from Jesus Christ, our Lord, which inspired you to renounce alcohol... and turn your back on all worldly pleasures.<eos> I'll taste it.<eos> What's that on your face?<eos> On your mouth, to be exact.<eos> Mmm. I might have been mistaken.<eos> It tastes rich.<eos> Put that wine down.<eos> You look like a streetwalker.<eos> Are you wearing lipstick? Mm-hmm.<eos> It's called Ravish Me Red.

Wow, bummer, dude, you have a time machine that somehow got programmed to this crap diner?<eos> I must admit, I am quite taken with steampunk.<eos> Oh, steampunk, right.<eos> I remember that trend.<eos> It happened for like 10 seconds back in two thousand and "are you kidding me"?
If I had that job, I'd be asking someone to please hold a gun to my head.<eos> He's probably excited to be working for Paul Platt.<eos> Look at all these magazines calling him the next Martha Stewart.<eos> Someday we'll have articles about us.<eos> Pictures of you and me... -...standing outside our country home.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> We're rich and still living together? - Okay, she's leaving.<eos> This is us.<eos> - About time.<eos> Been sitting here so long, my ass is asleep. Which kind of goes against my theory that it won't quit.
Including us.<eos> Come with me.<eos> This is Anil.<eos> It's an honor to meet you.<eos> What we have here is a Transilience Thought Unifier, Model-11.<eos> So, what's it do?<eos> Turn it on.<eos> Can we access its information?<eos> No, that's not how it works.<eos> - It accesses your information.

No.<eos> Juliette is in real danger, Nick, and we don't have much time.<eos> - Who's Juliette?<eos> - Oh, wow, so you two really haven't caught up in any significant way, I guess.<eos> Juliette's my girlfriend.<eos> And she's in a coma because of a hexenbiest.<eos> The hexenbiest that Nick destroyed with our help, by the way, just, you know, for the record.<eos> Nick, the spell is called I'esprit ailleurs.<eos> Literall spirit elsewhere.<eos> Oddly apropos. It causes memory loss with symptoms similar to dementia.
Was she involved in trying to kill aunt Marie?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> The only person I saw was adalind.<eos> Why would she try to kill her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What?<eos> Before she died, did aunt Marie give you anything?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A key.<eos> I have no idea what it's for, it doesn't open anything in the trailer, but...
Why would she try to kill her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What?<eos> Before she died, did aunt Marie give you anything?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A key.<eos> I have no idea what it's for, it doesn't open anything in the trailer, but...<eos> The sides of it make a...<eos> Map.<eos> Where is it?
And it's today?<eos> Mittwoch?<eos> It's Wednesday.<eos> All I know is he was taking both Michael and me somewhere.<eos> So what we're looking for... what did he say?<eos> Uh, "Vogel kirche"?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Huh.<eos> What? Is my accent really so bad?<eos> Yeah. It's terrible.
What she will have been through is absolutely...<eos> Just... indescribable.<eos> Knowing our son, I think he's trying to help her.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> My assistant Bohdan will help you with anything you need.<eos> Oksana?<eos> Michael...<eos> Yes?<eos> My blood sugar...<eos> I don't think it's stabilized.
"The same rules work everywhere".<eos> So that was the arrogance of that moment.<eos> The State Department funded through Harvard University a fairly small group of economists and lawyers, to manage this transition for the Russians.<eos> The transition includes the biggest experiment in privatization in the history of mankind.<eos> An experiment that will lead a nation to utter disaster.<eos> For one, two million dollars you could buy an enterprise where only steel constructions were so costly, that could be hundreds of million of dollars or billion of dollars.<eos> Like huge factories in the Urals, in Siberia, in central Russia, former military industrial enterprises, chemical enterprises, steel enterprises and so on.<eos> In the centre of Moscow, there is the hotel "Central", a 19th century beautiful building.<eos> They were going to sell it for the equivalent in rubles of 1.000 dollars.<eos> So we came there, in the foyer, in the lobby, there was a huge chandelier of the 19th century... and we asked a specialist... how much would he pay for it, if it was offered.
In order to achieve this, it will take two wars and the limitation of democratic freedoms.<eos> What saved Thatcher's career as a politician, what got her reelected was the Falklands war.<eos> She literally said: "We won the war abroad". "Now we must win the war at home".<eos> And the war at home was a war against trade unions.<eos> She was explicitly referring to the coalminers.<eos> In an extraordinarily violent way the Thatcher government just beat down that union.<eos> It was some of the most violent attacks on trade unions in the western world.<eos> Thatcher's Britain is a typical case of how the infringement of labor laws and the violation of workers' rights coincided with an increase in repressive measures.<eos> I still hate Thatcher<eos> It is characteristic that, nowadays, according to British law, when more than four people are picketing outside a workplace, the protest can be banned... because it can affect the morale of those working in the company.

The loss is tragic.<eos> The three most serious accidents caused by privatization cost 42 lives and 600 were injured.<eos> Ét was undoubted that in the early days of privatization, the way that the industry was privatized caused those accidents.<eos> Potters Bar tragedy on May 10th 2002<eos> The derailment of privatization did not just cost lives.<eos> Privatization was supposed to free up the railways, but has actually made it very difficult to make decisions on opening new routes or closing down routes or changing schedules.<eos> It has left a system, which is very complicated, very difficult to administer.<eos> It was bad for the passengers, it was a chaotic organization.<eos> It didn't work and hasn't worked. It's lost a huge amount of money.<eos> In a three year period, the state paid to the private companies in the form of subsidies what it had earned from the sale of the railways.
These loans are now presented by the governments as OSE's debt.<eos> This is untrue.<eos> 70-80% of it is money borrowed for infrastructure development.<eos> The major TV stations, behind which lie major contractors, are bombarding us with lies and slander.<eos> The critique is focused on the employees' salaries and the operation cost.<eos> This way major scandals go unnoticed which involve politicians, Greek and foreign companies.<eos> Tens of millions of euro are spent on railway lines that never work.<eos> Trains are rented for prices which they could be bought for.<eos> The state buys trains from Siemens without the appropriate network to use them.<eos> It also pays contractors for works that are never delivered.
This is basic public infrastructure, it demands major capital and the return is slow.<eos> There is no easy and quick profit for the private companies.<eos> Therefore, gradually, from 2000 to 2006, in order for the market to attract private investors, the consumption bills started to rise.<eos> The taxpayers do not just pay more expensive bills.<eos> Without knowing it, they subsidize the private energy producers.<eos> Mytilinaios owns the "Aloumina" and Latsis the oil refineries.<eos> They needed electricity so they created power production units for their own companies.<eos> However, they realised that it is less profitable to consume their own power.<eos> So, they sold their electricity to the public power company for a 100 euro per megawatt hour wholesale, while the public power company sold electricity to them and to other industrialists for 43 euro.<eos> In the case of photovoltaic power, the public company buys it at 51 cents, while it sells it for 11 cents per kilowatt hour.
Very nice.<eos> It'll be even better with a bit of money spent on it.<eos> Can I get you some tea?<eos> If I'm staying long enough.<eos> I don't know what it is Mr Bates wants to see me about.<eos> You'll have time for tea.<eos> Will that be all, ma'am?<eos> There is one thing.<eos> There was a letter delivered by hand this afternoon.<eos> It's from the dowager.
Okay.<eos> Tell me about your mother.<eos> What do you know about my mom?<eos> I know she was murdered, and I know the case is still open.<eos> You know why?<eos> 'Cause of who she was.<eos> Where we're from.<eos> What if it was your wife who was killed?<eos> Hmm? How fast would that case get closed?<eos> It got closed pretty quick.
What's with the attitude?<eos> It's a splint.<eos> I broke my finger last night because of you.<eos> See, everybody?<eos> And how exactly was I involved in that?<eos> You didn't answer your phone.<eos> I was in line at a club when some dog-faced bitch shoved me and I tripped and fell on the ground.<eos> - And that's how you broke your finger? - No.<eos> I was angry, so I called Charlie to talk me down, but you didn't pick up.<eos> So I found said bitch, took her face, shoved it into the turntables, got my finger caught in her cheap-ass weave, and it broke.
How long will it take?<eos> I can pull together a list of development firms,<eos> - start making some phone calls.<eos> - I got it. Too much work for one person.<eos> Might as well divide and conquer.<eos> - I said I've got it.<eos> - Look, I can be an asset here.<eos> I spent two years with Ted Schachter before Driscoll's office.<eos> I've seen your resume.<eos> If I'm being kind, it seemed embellished.
The CIA know about you.<eos> I gotta get you out of here.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> - I'll explain in the car.<eos> Hurry. - No, tell me now.<eos> The CIA had an operation in Beirut to kill Abu Nazir.<eos> He escaped, but they found intelligence that may lead to you.<eos> - Where are you taking me?<eos> - To a safe house.<eos> How do you know it's safe?
Follow me.<eos> What you're about to find is very important.<eos> Captain Windmark,<eos> I've just been alerted.<eos> Walter Bishop has been sighted in Quadrant 9.<eos> You are certain.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, reaching the hallway, turn right.<eos> Not left.<eos> If you continue on to where the hall you're in dead-ends, you will find that it's not a dead end at all.
Granted.<eos> Brianna, isn't it true that you simply left your ring at home that day so as not to risk it<eos> - getting stolen? - Objection.<eos> Leading the witness.<eos> And poorly, at that.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Sorry, Your Honor.<eos> I'll rephrase.<eos> Brianna, do you remember why you didn't wear your ring that day?<eos> Yes, because I was afraid it might get stolen or lost.
The button isn't there any more.<eos> - Because you removed it?<eos> - Objection... argumentative.<eos> I'm merely asking the question.<eos> - You are not.<eos> - You removed the red button because you made a mistake and you were trying to cover your tracks.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Isn't that correct?<eos> He charged at me. What does it matter about the sticker?<eos> Who cares whether it's gone?

Yes, the mirror!<eos> If you hadn't cried over that mirror He wouldn't have risked his life.<eos> You were the reason I dropped it!<eos> What's so special about that mirror?<eos> It's just one of thousands from a factory.<eos> You can buy the same one over and over.<eos> What's all the fuss about?<eos> I told you it was a birthday present from Mom! So what?<eos> !<eos> You think it's filled with her love or something?
Tell me, what do you want with the barn, the Colorado Kid?<eos> What do you want with my son?<eos> Your son knows how to stop the troubles.<eos> What?<eos> Parker?<eos> Parker!<eos> Hey, what happened?<eos> The skinwalker.<eos> It's wearing Claire... and has been for days.<eos> Audrey, how come it didn't kill you when it had the chance?
What?<eos> Parker?<eos> Parker!<eos> Hey, what happened?<eos> The skinwalker.<eos> It's wearing Claire... and has been for days.<eos> Audrey, how come it didn't kill you when it had the chance?<eos> Nathan...<eos> It's me.<eos> You feel me, right? I think that it wants to keep me alive.
I don't know.<eos> She said that my son knew the answers.<eos> - That he could stop the troubles.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Then we'll find him.<eos> - I'm out of time.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> The skinwalker's gonna have to lose Claire's skin now in order to stay hidden.<eos> We just have to figure out who it's gonna be wearing next.
Audrey... Dies.<eos> Yes.<eos> But I don't want Audrey to die.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go and try to figure out the way to stay.<eos> What?<eos> I can just go? Yes.<eos> But know this, Audrey.<eos> The sky is starting to fall.<eos> While you're out there attempting the impossible, trying to stay, it will continue to fall faster and faster, until the town and everyone you love in it have been destroyed.
I finally took a look at the police report, and it said that it looked like they were all ejected from the vehicle.<eos> They found Moira and Noelle standing in the road, just in shock.<eos> Their dad was dead.<eos> I checked that.<eos> I'm checking them again.<eos> There's no keys missing.<eos> Get that light over here.<eos> You find something?<eos> The edge of that key's all shiny.<eos> It's new.
Ophélie, no!<eos> Don't do this!<eos> The City barbarian, the finance anarchist,<eos> London's vampire...<eos> The best tailor in London.<eos> You'll experience unimaginable pleasure.<eos> Soft fabric flapping on your leg, a furtive and voluptuous caress...<eos> The estate agent!<eos> It's going down.<eos> The property market is down, it could collapse.
And so, to face up to the blows of the market, the governments have no choice but...<eos> Reduce their spending.<eos> Set out austerity plans, call on everyone to help, postpone the age of...<eos> Retirement.<eos> Cut down...<eos> On civil servants, on their...<eos> Their salaries, and all unnecessary expenses.<eos> That way, there will be less waste and more work.<eos> Isn't our capitalist system wonderfully clever?<eos> It turns what should have killed it into an advantage.
- No.<eos> - Who is she?<eos> This is from primitive steel.<eos> It has a good deal of slag in it.<eos> Remind me why I care about slag and get to the hunch part.<eos> Well, the last time this type of steel was manufactured was in the 15th century.<eos> That's a gauntlet from a post-medieval Scottish knight's suit of armor.<eos> Let me see this petri dish.<eos> You think that this ring could be from chain mail from a suit of armor?<eos> - I think it might be from a gauntlet.
Dan introduces Isabelle to his friend, Tom MacGregor.<eos> Can I try?<eos> What? You just did my test.<eos> - It's guessing.<eos> You'll get hives.<eos> - It's theorizing.<eos> Tom MacGregor gives Isabelle Rohypnol and he rapes her.<eos> She feels the effects of the drug and tries getting away.<eos> I will raise your theory.<eos> He backhands her with the gauntlet so hard it splits her face open then panics, strangles her and calls Dan, the fixer, to get rid of the body.
So, anyway...<eos> I was thinking, if you're not doing anything, I hear there's pizza in the kitchen.<eos> Do you want to go?<eos> Or I could just bring you a piece.<eos> I don't want you touching my food.<eos> I'll get it myself.<eos> Great.<eos> It's a date.<eos> We got a great table.<eos> Only problem is it's so close to the kitchen.
'Cause they were under orders to get you what you paid for.<eos> - And yet you escaped.<eos> - We lost 11 men. Was I supposed to get myself killed, too?<eos> Rosetti controls the roads in and out of Tabor Heights, taken up residence in the town, commandeered the sheriff's department.<eos> He burned the sheriff.<eos> There are other routes. Don't you think I've considered that?<eos> How about your million dollar fucking highway?<eos> Must you swear every time you speak?<eos> When did you become a Quaker?<eos> Firstly, it's no longer my highway, and it costs considerably more than a million dollars.

Thirdly, the other routes are not viable.
- Tough game, isn't it?<eos> - Show business?<eos> You know what they say, dying is easy.<eos> Good luck with the new one.<eos> I'll be fifth row center.<eos> I knew you'd understand.<eos> And thanks for lunch.<eos> Forgot your vodka.<eos> They pray to that fat fuck?<eos> It's a symbol of enlightenment.
People called me "Cheeky One" when I was young.<eos> My father called me "Funny One".<eos> I'm done.<eos> You don't say anything.<eos> I want more children. A lot of them.<eos> -Five.<eos> -How about eight now?<eos> We should sleep for a bit.<eos> We won't be able to.<eos> Death is powerful. It gives you wings.
Brad?<eos> Is that you?<eos> It's me.<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> We thought you were dead.<eos> Did you hide the pendant?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We have friends here.<eos> Some of the guards are with the rebels.<eos> If you tell me where it is, the rebels can go and get it... Before Monroe does.
To what do I owe the displeasure?<eos> From all around the world, our favorite Upper East Siders are asking the same question.<eos> But I couldn't care less.<eos> Serena Van Der Woodsen is dead.<eos> At least to me.<eos> Spotted at J.F.K. and Teterboro-- our favorite U.E.S.ers returning home.<eos> What motivated this sudden flurry of transatlantic travel?<eos> Could it be a certain passport that didn't get stamped this summer?<eos> No, her passport's here.<eos> It was in a box with her other things.
Serena recouping in rehab is much less interesting than a full-on slut spiral.<eos> That's a heartwarming tale, but why--why would you just assume that Chuck is with Blair anyway?<eos> No, hey!<eos> Georgina, wait a second.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You gotta hold up.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get in!<eos> Open the--stop the car.<eos> So the place we're going to doesn't look like it's on an actual road.
And to have the love of my life by my side.<eos> So let's, uh, let's all raise a glass--<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> We will raise nothing!<eos> You cannot marry her.<eos> You don't even know her!<eos> Blair, please.<eos> Her name isn't Sabrina either.<eos> It is Serena.
Certainly very bad form.<eos> Evil giants who made magic portal beans.<eos> Why doesn't anyone just go up and grow some more?<eos> Because one giant survived.<eos> The strongest and most terrible of them all.<eos> Now we'll have to get past him to...<eos> The magic compass.<eos> Indeed.<eos> The treasure remains, and amongst it is the compass.<eos> Now it will guide us to your land.
Whoever figures out the bank robber's name first wins lunch for a week.<eos> Yeah, that usually doesn't end well for us.<eos> What do you say, Grace?<eos> You feeling lucky?<eos> You're on.<eos> It was closed.<eos> You're certain?<eos> Must've been closed.<eos> The safe deposit vault is always closed.<eos> I think it was closed. Yeah.
All right.<eos> CBI, ma'am.<eos> Your 2002 white Dodge van was reported stolen last Wednesday. Mm-hmm.<eos> Any idea who might have taken it?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> If I did, dude would be rotting in a cell about now.<eos> Is that 70 inches?<eos> Expensive.<eos> Mom's got glaucoma.<eos> Your van--it was ten years old and in bad condition.
If I did, dude would be rotting in a cell about now.<eos> Is that 70 inches?<eos> Expensive.<eos> Mom's got glaucoma.<eos> Your van--it was ten years old and in bad condition.<eos> That's an odd vehicle to steal, isn't it?<eos> And suddenly you have the cash to buy a new TV?<eos> Listen, the longer you lie to us, the worse it's gonna be.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> It wasn't stolen.
I sold it.<eos> To who?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Dude didn't give me his name.<eos> Didn't want me to sign over the title, either.<eos> But he gave me a couple thousand extra, so I was like...<eos> "All right."<eos> So why'd you report it stolen?<eos> I didn't know what he was gonna do with that van.<eos> And it was still in my name. Mnh-mnh.
I heard his own brother tried to have him killed.<eos> No kidding.<eos> That's what they say.<eos> Wow.<eos> Lose your own flesh and blood, what do you have?<eos> You don't have anything.<eos> You have no idea how uncomfortable this is.<eos> You've made your discontent abundantly clear.<eos> I meant the suit.<eos> It shrunk or something.
You shouldn't be in places like this, neighbor.<eos> I got talked into it.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> Pay the fine direct to me, and we'll leave it at that.<eos> - Pay you the fine?<eos> - That's how it works.<eos> You must be a pitiful salesman if this is all you got on you.<eos> Don't let me see you here again.<eos> So they load the coffin in the ship, right?<eos> And there's this scene, it moves around all by itself. No one's touching it.
Had a menage-a-raccoon in my backyard.<eos> Seen Charlie and Danny?<eos> They left early.<eos> They said they were going hunting.<eos> Better be.<eos> Take a look.<eos> Charlie, how 'bout we actually go hunting for once?<eos> No one's stopping you.<eos> Really?<eos> The freezer, it doesn't work.
Not in here.<eos> No funny business now.<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> I'm not...<eos> What happened?<eos> Well, if you're gonna have an asthma attack, at least you had the good sense to have it near me.<eos> Here.<eos> What is this?<eos> You breathe it in.<eos> It stops the attack before it starts.
Where's the angel?<eos> CLEM:<eos> So here's what I'm thinking.<eos> Full immunity from all charges, both past, present and future.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Dean, come on.<eos> - You feel that?<eos> - There's a stream.<eos> - Go on.<eos> It runs through a clearing not far from here.
- Sounds like a plan. Let's roll.<eos> DEAN:<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> Cass we're getting out of here.<eos> We're going home.<eos> - Dean, I can't.<eos> DEAN:<eos> You can.<eos> Benny, tell him.<eos> Purgatory has an escape hatch, but I got no idea if it's angel-friendly.
Watch yourself.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Cargo on board right on schedule.<eos> Last man down.<eos> Hatch secured.<eos> Lock them up in supply.<eos> Don't open them. Aye, XO.<eos> What's in 'em?<eos> So you just left civilization and never looked back? Yeah.<eos> At first I thought this place was just my heritage, but it turned out to be my salvation.
You were dreaming.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What time did you get in last night?<eos> Uh, after 3:00.<eos> We've got this missing girl and not a lot to go on.<eos> I just... Keep running it over and over in my head, trying to figure out if I'm missing something.<eos> Maybe you should try to get some more sleep.<eos> Not on this couch.<eos> Okay, well, I made you some coffee.<eos> It's in the kitchen.
Do you really think that one of us had something to do with that man's death?<eos> Honestly, sir, we don't, but we have to ask.<eos> We were at St. Stephen's church with friends, praying for a miracle.<eos> And we got one.<eos> Donna, we need to ask you a few questions about the night you were abducted.<eos> What do you remember?<eos> It was about 7:30.<eos> I was...<eos> I was getting into the elevator when somebody came up behind me, grabbed me, put something over my mouth.<eos> When I woke up, I was tied up in the back of a van, and it was moving.
Previously on Revenge:<eos> Your mother's alive.<eos> I'm going to find out what happened to her.<eos> Your blood work...<eos> it's positive for hydrocodone.
I don't know about perfect.<eos> She was adequate and was nice.<eos> You don't want me to pick Bryce because she's a girl.<eos> I do not have an issue with you working with a girl.<eos> I would just prefer if the girl were... rounder.<eos> Naomi...<eos> Okay, fine, I have a problem with you working with a girl.<eos> I'm not an idiot, Max.<eos> Bryce is beautiful and smart and she speaks geek.<eos> You don't put a piece of meat in front of a dog and expect it to say, "No, thanks.
It doesn't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I remember my first...<eos> Dad.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Does it get any easier?<eos> Oh, God, no.<eos> But... the human mind is a wonderful thing.<eos> It forgets pain, so you can... go out and get some more.
He's a pro -- no fingerprints, never any sign of forced entry -- just a pair of those every time, like he's signing his work.<eos> Perp's never done anything like this before, though...obviously. You mind if I take a look at your files on those other break-ins?<eos> No skin off my nose.<eos> I'm headed to the station now if you want a ride.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can you lift this?<eos> "X" marks the spot.<eos> Well, whoever's doing this is playing by cartoon rules.<eos> - Animation doesn't have rules.<eos> - Sure it does.
But that's not who we are.<eos> We're gonna have to do it the hard way.<eos> Slow and steady.<eos> The tortoise and the whore.<eos> Well, what can I say, "caramel?"<eos> By the way, that's your whore name.<eos> Looks like it's back to selling cakes one car at a time.<eos> I'll just put these "Ludacris Specials" in the display case.<eos> You do that, "Cinnamon."<eos> Oh, no, I actually have a whore name, and that's not it.
It's done.<eos> Then undo it.<eos> Let him ride out his tenure.<eos> Firing him would be bad for the hospital and bad for you.<eos> Please, just--just-- just let this slide.<eos> Look, I know you're in an awkward position, and it's partly my fault for sticking you with him.<eos> You came in a little strong, and I felt like I needed to temper your overconfidence.<eos> But he's holding you back. And once he's gone, you'll see that.<eos> Okay, her temp is 96. What were her last coags?<eos> Her I.N.R. was 1.3, and I tested her pH levels 2 hours ago, and it was 7.29.
And now he's taken it away.<eos> I've been living on borrowed time, haven't I?<eos> Sooner or later, he was bound to figure out... I never really rose to his challenge.<eos> I'm still just a... drunken whore... and a murderer, trying to disguise my darkness... under that miserable black cloth.<eos> You deserve some peace, Jude.<eos> You deserve a peace... befitting your extraordinary, tireless efforts... to find meaning in this life.<eos> How long can you live on free coffee and crackers, Jude?<eos> The winters here are long, and they're very cold.<eos> And the whiskey won't keep you warm.<eos> It just rots your insides.
I'm ready.<eos> But I need to do one last thing.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> Maybe we should call Briarcliff.<eos> At least they could give her a bed for the night.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She's a fussy baby, this one.<eos> So you were saying you were Missy's teacher?<eos> Hank, you bringing that coffee?<eos> I got it, dear.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I want to apologize for going off on you this morning.<eos> No need.<eos> Really?<eos> Water under the bridge.<eos> Which, coincidentally, is where I had to park my car.<eos> Well, I appreciate that.<eos> And, uh, just FYI, pigeons nest under there.<eos> My car already looks like it's covered in mashed potatoes.

No matter who teaches me how to feed.<eos> All right.<eos> [Gasps, sighs]<eos> Just be careful, ok?<eos> The blood, the feed... It's easy to get caught up in it.<eos> I will.<eos> I promise.<eos> What's that?<eos> The key to your new truck.<eos> It's parked outside, paid for, insured, everything but a big red bow.
I may have something.<eos> It's about the Nolcorp request.<eos> Okay, how do you know about that?<eos> Because I'm ambitious, same as you.<eos> When David Clarke worked here, he ran venture capital, right?<eos> What if Nolan Ross came to him for start-up money?<eos> But he didn't, or there'd be a record of it.<eos> Not if the money he invested came from a personal account.<eos> See, I think the young lady from Nolcorp was trying to sniff out whether or not Clarke's contract contained an exclusivity clause.<eos> Which it would have.
- This is your second marriage? - Third.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I never found anyone to satisfy me, I guess.<eos> They either bore me or die.<eos> That doesn't sound Jewish.<eos> It sounds Chinese.<eos> - Ellis Island.<eos> - Oh. - Lee for Liebenbaum.<eos> - Oh. I've always liked Jewish men.<eos> I always thought a penis never looked quite right unless it was circumcised.
Yeah, it's not a picture I ever... pictured, but...<eos> Yeah, she does bring out a side of you.<eos> She does, doesn't she?<eos> Maybe that's it;<eos> maybe life's not a picture.<eos> Maybe it's a movie.<eos> And I, for one, am curious to see how this one ends. Hey!<eos> This is Dolly Parton!<eos> ♪ You took something of mine, and I want it back ♪<eos> You just, like, you just catapult the bird so it hits the pig.
We'll give you five minutes to consider your situation.<eos> Then we take you somewhere special where my comrade's wish can come true.<eos> I know why you're here.<eos> I know what they did to Colleen.<eos> - Who the hell are you?<eos> - An ally.<eos> If you were, you would've let me kill him.<eos> Killing Dmitri is not gonna bring your sister back.<eos> What do you know about the downing of Flight 197?<eos> It happened a week after my sister was taken. What else?
I'm coming in.<eos> Don't worry, buddy.<eos> I told you she was nuts.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> What?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> I'm having the best sex of my life.<eos> Oh, hi, Alan.<eos> How was the movie?<eos> It was...
Professor Devlin?<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> Happy to help if I can.<eos> Sure, um, you spoke to a uniform at the, uh, crime scene.<eos> You work close by?<eos> Yes. I was, uh... I was leaving my office late.<eos> I teach economics at the university.<eos> I'm working on a book. When I heard this horrible music blasting from an SUV.<eos> Can you describe the SUV?<eos> Uh, it was white with tinted windows-- couldn't see inside.
She believed the wolf is something to be ashamed of.<eos> I see things differently.<eos> Humans want us to believe we are the monsters.<eos> The moment you believe them, that's when you become one.<eos> You're not the first to learn the truth about yourself through tragedy.<eos> So many of us spend so much of our life suppressing the wolf.<eos> They have no idea how to control it. (EXHALES)<eos> They just need help.<eos> Help embracing their true nature.<eos> The only way you will ever control the wolf is by accepting it as a part of you.
I start telling people that you're putting their lives in danger to protect your own interests, you'll have a mutiny on your hands.<eos> Yeah, we'll see.<eos> You want her? You have to go through me.<eos> I look forward to that.<eos> ANITA: It'll be like nothing you've ever felt before.<eos> The pine needles underfoot.<eos> The air rushing over your fur.<eos> Your brothers and sisters at your side.<eos> Your mind won't want to believe it.<eos> It will tell you a wolf is invading your body, trying to take over.
I was looking at your boobs.<eos> Well, I do what I can but they'll never be as big as yours.<eos> Pick up.<eos> Meatball.<eos> Hey, hot stuff.<eos> Where's the hot stuff?<eos> Oh, Max. You were right.<eos> This heel is much more--no.<eos> No, wait!<eos> No, it's not.

It's no big deal.<eos> Here.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> The store.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I didn't try to steal a sweatshirt!<eos> Sir, I'm a mom.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - Gloria, help me out.<eos> Listen, Mr. Policeman, if we wanted to steal it, you wouldn't even know that it was gone!
There's a tiny blue dot on the patient's head, just below the hairline.<eos> That's a tattoo used to target radiation treatment, which means the patient had brain cancer;<eos> blood clots are a common complication.<eos> He threw a clot, which led to a pulmonary embolism, which led to a heart attack.<eos> We're in agreement on the heart attack.<eos> As to how it happened, you're completely off base.<eos> What room was he in when he died?<eos> Um, 704.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The heart attack was intended to look natural, but it was induced with epinephrine.
You know, I'm at Honeywell Cootes, and they're looking to hire an associate.<eos> I could totally recommend you.<eos> Leave the wounded behind!<eos> 'Cause Brad is an old friend who needs a job.<eos> Why shouldn't I give him the old Marshall Eriksen Stamp of Approval?<eos> Marshall, you're a stamp tramp.<eos> How dare you!<eos> And what is that?<eos> You give your stamp of approval to everything.<eos> It's become meaningless.
I'm Ted.<eos> - Nailed it.<eos> - Totally.<eos> Okay, Ted, name one cool thing you've given your stamp to first...<eos> - Dr. Berkowitz.<eos> that isn't an ear, nose and throat doctor.<eos> Man, these strip clubs want me so bad.<eos> They're sending me T-shirts, beer cozies.<eos> Sticky's even sent me a boob-shaped hand-sanitizer dispenser.<eos> It's clean and dirty at the same time.
It's just a motion to compel the production of a witness.<eos> Nothing too elaborate.<eos> I can see that.<eos> I'm trying to keep it simple...<eos> Well?<eos> - It's well-reasoned.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Any pointers?<eos> You won't win the motion.<eos> But you just said it was well-reasoned.
There was an embargo in place which made it illegal, and then things got complicated.<eos> Was anyone hurt?<eos> No.<eos> Well, that's all I needed to know.<eos> There's something to be said for having a partner in crime.<eos> Did your dad dump the bitch yet?<eos> But I wondered if you'd seen Bart do anything unusual in the apartment.<eos> Maybe the reason he's so intent on keeping me out is because what I need's inside.<eos> Mm.<eos> Well, he did hold on to this envelope the whole time, but I didn't see who it was from.
It is too late.<eos> What is this, some kind of joke?<eos> What in the world are you doing here?<eos> I know I said I wouldn't help you, but I changed my mind.<eos> I have what you're looking for.<eos> They say nothing inspires forgiveness quite like revenge.<eos> The microfilm was in that envelope, I swear.<eos> If you don't find it and hand it over-- all the torture you wished on Lily, it'll seem like child's play.<eos> My father's threats aren't idle.<eos> There's only one person who knew I had it, who might know where it is.
Well, maybe that's why Lily doesn't respect you.<eos> So is this how you become Bart Bass?<eos> I did what I had to do.<eos> And tonight, for the first time, they weren't looking down on me.<eos> They might've hated me, but I was one of them.<eos> Congratulations... I guess.<eos> So now that you've achieved that, you can come back to Brooklyn.<eos> What I want isn't in Brooklyn, dad.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> I have this whole time... and it's working.
Based in Rotterdam.<eos> And what is it you do for them?<eos> A little bit of everything.<eos> You know, I've only been with them for a couple of months, but I'm here to tell you, they have their hands in a lot of pies.<eos> Do you know what the key to their success is?<eos> - No, I'm not interested.<eos> - You should be.<eos> That's what this all comes down to, Nick.<eos> The key.<eos> You know where it is.
Mmhmm. What with killing the Mauvais Dentes and the Nuckelavee.<eos> He's turning quite a few heads.<eos> Well, then maybe you should stop testing him.<eos> Aw, do you feel your little Grimm slipping away?<eos> I know, you should have killed me when you had the chance.<eos> Oh, I blame myself, really.<eos> I should have known you'd go to my brother.<eos> Oh, just in case you're interested,<eos> Nick's dear aunt Marie came to town towing a trailer full of all kinds of fun things.<eos> Well, where is it?
So you just-- you know how...<eos> - Right.<eos> - ...<eos> Delicious it is.<eos> And it's just-- it's right there, you know?<eos> I do.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> So... so you have it.<eos> You have the dessert.<eos> And it is delicious.
Pretty nifty win-win you set up for yourself.<eos> Hey, buddy, I'm just ringing the bell two nights a week... to get out of the house till my wife falls asleep.<eos> Santa?<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> This is a fantastic train set.<eos> The farm even has tiny little hay bales.<eos> - It's my dad's.<eos> Where's your beard?<eos> I shaved.<eos> It was scratchy.
Oh, you really don't want me out there with other people this time of year.<eos> Not as yourself.<eos> Your beard goes perfectly with the suit.<eos> Jesus, you don't know what Christmas means to me?<eos> I do, Lee.<eos> I know you were a petty criminal thrown in jail... for shoplifting a loaf of bread,<eos> and while you were in there, the jailers went caroling in the cell block, and five men held you down... and took your virginity.<eos> Well, the first one did.<eos> The others took your dignity... and your self-esteem and... and most importantly... Your Christmas spirit.<eos> But then you got out, and you found the suit, and it gave you everything you were missing.
I thought, which is better, to walk by without stepping on it, or go back and help it?<eos> I went back. I picked it up and took it to a bush across the street.<eos> And I said to it, "This is what I can do for you." I can't do anything else. May God help you for the rest."<eos> Oh.<eos> You said that to the bug?<eos> Don't get hung up on that. Sometimes we have problems with people.<eos> You did well.<eos> It was interesting, though.<eos> You know, deep down, this guy got something.<eos> Then I thought to myself, maybe it wanted to commit suicide. Because it was sitting in the middle of the road.
I didn't want to put another woman through the same pain.<eos> This is like a whole different world, sir.<eos> I sometimes have trouble keeping up.<eos> Everybody does, Oğuz.<eos> Not only me, even the commanders, even the Special Forces.<eos> The main thing is, to accomplish the mission no matter what.<eos> Why do a hundred men keep watch on the hills?<eos> They tell us, to leave the mountains and take care of the cities and the fields.<eos> But that mountain, Oğuz. The mountain is the crown of the land.<eos> It's the closest place to the sky.
Unless the pilot was the killer.<eos> You're saying that the pilot got up from his controls to attack a passenger?<eos> Drivers get road rage.<eos> Can a pilot get air rage?<eos> Would you come with me?<eos> Let's talk logistics.<eos> Did you find something?<eos> Sand.<eos> Well, yeah... th-these granules aren't frosted.<eos> Natural sand is, um, it's smoother, weathered.
Pilots often don't include themselves in the count.<eos> I believe this one did.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> That he didn't know Hank Gerrard was in the cabin?<eos> I'm saying Hank Gerrard wasn't in the cabin.<eos> But that's impossible.<eos> His body was in the wreckage.<eos> Allow me, if you will, another interpretation of the evidence.<eos> Hank Gerrard wasn't killed on the plane, he was killed elsewhere, and earlier in the morning.<eos> It would explain why the wrench hasn't turned up, 'cause it wasn't on the plane.
Guess again.<eos> Mr. Devlin and Ms. Wilson did not kill Hank Gerrard;<eos> they didn't even know where he was.<eos> Joe Newell, an experienced pilot, would've known better than to stash the extra weight of his body in the cargo hold and risk exactly the kind of accident that occurred.<eos> They may be dead, but the person who killed Hank Gerrard is not.<eos> We have a living, breathing murderer to find after all.<eos> What was the killer thinking?<eos> Why stuff Gerrard's body in the hold of the plane, like so much luggage?<eos> Surely he knew it would be discovered when the plane reached Martha's Vineyard.<eos> Did he want it found?
He worked for Monica Tenez.<eos> She's running for U.S. Senate.<eos> Ah. Former social worker.<eos> She supports the Occupy movement, she's a children's rights activist and runs an organization that feeds the homeless.<eos> So, for those sick of politicians, Tenez is the real deal.<eos> Okay, thank you for the Profile in Courage, but why is a hit-and-run a case for NCIS?<eos> Eric, play the video again, this time ten seconds earlier.<eos> That was not an accident.<eos> We need to find out if Clay's murder is related to Tenez's campaign.<eos> If it's not, it will be handed over to the LAPD.

- No.<eos> David. He went under a sleeping spell so he could see me.<eos> He thought that my kiss would wake him, but it didn't,<eos> - and now he's trapped.<eos> - Okay, slow down.<eos> David is trapped in there?<eos> I have to get back.<eos> There's only one way to help him.<eos> True love's kiss.<eos> Yes, but it won't work in there.
"Rape is never funny.<eos> Unless you're raped by a clown."<eos> How is this funny, Ms. Dodd?<eos> Sir, that wasn't part of the original act.<eos> I understand that, but I find myself confused by Ms. Dodd's sense of humor.<eos> Do you know that every 45 seconds, there is another sexual assault in America?<eos> So I'm not sure how rape is funny.<eos> The joke isn't about rape, sir.<eos> It's about a ridiculous juxtaposition.<eos> But it makes light of rape, doesn't it?
There's been a change in plans.<eos> What would that be?<eos> My daughter's curse is coming.<eos> We have to protect ourselves.<eos> Wouldn't it have been easier to reconcile with her before her curse destroys the land?<eos> Regina doesn't need me.<eos> Not now. Not when she thinks she's about to win.<eos> But I still have a place in her heart.<eos> And the curse won't last forever.<eos> It will end.
No.<eos> No apology is necessary.<eos> I understand why you wanted to keep Cora out of here.<eos> Just remind me never to bet against you in the future, Miss Swan.<eos> It's not really a bet when the game is rigged, is it?<eos> To what exactly are you referring?<eos> Your scroll.<eos> I saw it in your cell.<eos> You wrote my name again, and again, and again.<eos> I just wanted to make sure it would stick.
Until 1990 you could see it completely normally on TV.<eos> Around the end of 1990 it was broadcast for the last time.<eos> It was supposed to be released on VHS around Christmas of 1990.<eos> CIC Video planned to release it.<eos> It was already January, February of 1991, the months just went by but that VHS tape didn't show up.<eos> Apart from that, it wasn't shown on TV anymore.<eos> That's how the "case" or the mystery of Four Flies on Grey Velvet originated because you didn't get to see it anywhere anymore.<eos> After a couple years went by people began to ask themselves what ever happened to the film.<eos> It was Dario's only lost movie.<eos> Hence people tried to find out what happened and why it could not be found.

The thing is that the production company SEDA Spettacoli, which produced the film - ...SEDA stands for "Salvatore e Dario Argento", so it was their own production company...<eos> This production company produced the film for Paramount in 1971.<eos> Or rather with Paramount's French production company "Marianne Productions", which was located in Paris.<eos> Consequently, Paramount had gained the movie's distribution rights.<eos> The contracts were made, as usual, by Dario's father Salvatore.<eos> He took care of it.<eos> I've even seen them.<eos> They were real thick American contracts.<eos> They had 200 pages and were written in English.<eos> After that the film went into distribution and everybody was happy since it was a success.

So he asked himself the same thing.<eos> At a certain point, the old SEDA contracts came back to the surface.<eos> These contracts did state that Paramount was the owner of the movie but their property rights were restricted to US territory.<eos> Plus, they owned the 50% of the property rights for some other countries.<eos> The rest of the rights belonged to the SEDA.<eos> The SEDA didn't exist anymore since it was liquidated.<eos> So the search for the bankruptcy trustee began who had overseen the insolvency proceedings.<eos> These examinations, however, cost a lot of time.<eos> By this time it was already the beginning of the new millennium.<eos> It turned out that the film wasn't part of the insolvency since it was regarded as sold.
And Dario refused to re-cut the movie.<eos> A pretty intense trial of strength followed.<eos> This took a while so that the movie missed its release date.<eos> The film didn't open at the end of January after the Christmas movies since this issue wasn't settled.<eos> Dario totally refused to do the changes demanded by Lombardo.<eos> The release was postponed, and in the end, Lombardo gave in.<eos> He gave in because Dario refused to change the film and it therefore lay idle.<eos> In the end, Lombardo, as the distributor and financier of the movie, said:<eos> "Oh well, let's release it."<eos> It was postponed and finally opened in March, I believe.

I never thought that could happen.<eos> It was almost my annual salary as a journalist.<eos> A sum that blew my imagination.<eos> From our conversations Dario knew very well that I had already done Il tunnel sotto il mondo and wanted to be a director, and so on.<eos> So he told me:<eos> "We've finished the screenplay.<eos> Join me during the shoot.<eos> You could be my assistant."<eos> I immediately accepted his offer since it was a huge chance for me.<eos> To see how an important film came together, because that's what it was, without a doubt.
Which he did.<eos> He was supposed to do the shots for these scenes with his special camera.<eos> But innumerous problems came up, and it was pretty difficult.<eos> It's probably the most spectacular, most beautiful and magic scene in the film.<eos> But it was also the most complicated one in terms of getting it right.<eos> To do it, we really had to work in the sweat of our brows.<eos> If you take a closer look at it, you can see a couple of flaws.<eos> I still remember that we had two cars in the beginning that were supposed to get destroyed.<eos> The trunk was not a common, robust car trunk.<eos> It was a lead-like trunk with a light metal alloy so it could be crushed much more easily.
Only few people mention this.<eos> But it was always the case with Dario's films that as long as Fraticelli did the editing they had a different "look" than the one they had in the subsequent period.<eos> Fraticelli was an editor who put his stamp on a movie.<eos> An editor who made clear to the director:<eos> "Listen, this scene is unnecessary.<eos> Look, this scene doesn't match here, it should appear at another spot."<eos> So he also worked on the structure of a film if it was necessary.<eos> The problem with Deep Purple was due to the editing.<eos> Until then the film had American actors British musicians and a French editor.<eos> It ran the risk of having no nationality.
My God, it's the same mug.<eos> The evidence was planted, and it was Captain Gregson who gave him that mug.<eos> I've been struggling with something.<eos> Oh, good morning to you, too.<eos> Why did you tell me to look at the tape?<eos> Did you honestly think I wouldn't notice?<eos> The mug.<eos> The one that you handed to Wade Crewes during your second interrogation of him.<eos> It's the same one that your men found at the third crime scene.<eos> I want you to understand, I take no pleasure in pursuing this line of inquiry, but I am obliged to pursue the facts, and the facts are you and Detective D'Amico had possession of that mug before it showed up at the third crime scene.
I don't have to. I know what's on it.<eos> And I know I'll never let you take it.<eos> At any price.<eos> I do like men with glasses.<eos> Too bad.<eos> Shoot the dog.<eos> I wouldn't do that, fellas.<eos> Mr. Reese!<eos> Nice try.<eos> Little high... and outside, but it still got there.
I went back.<eos> To the subway tunnels?<eos> Evan, you were kidnapped and almost killed by a psycho frat boy.<eos> Yeah, and then saved by some mysterious vigilante.<eos> It's understandable that you're traumatized;<eos> what you went through was brutal. It was.<eos> But it's more than that, you know?<eos> It happened so fast.<eos> I heard a psycho getting ripped apart by some thing, and then you saved me, bullets flying...<eos> Evan, whoever this vigilante is, it is not a "some thing."
Don't you ever get tired of this memory game?<eos> You do it every morning.<eos> The mind is a muscle, Watson.<eos> It needs to be exercised regularly lest it turn flabby.
I have never seen these letters before.<eos> I don't know anything about the ELM, and I certainly didn't build any bombs.<eos> Lie, lie and lie.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I am the man with the button.<eos> It's from the elevator down the hall.<eos> You pushed it to get to this floor.<eos> As soon as you disembarked, I removed it, and took it to the department's latent print unit.<eos> It has your fingerprint on it, you see.<eos> Which means it has a great deal in common with a component from a bomb the ELM detonated in a lumber mill in Utica in 2005.
Be in the same zip code.<eos> I'm ready for that now. And now I think my family is, too.<eos> Brick, I-I... like my life the way it is right now.<eos> I just don't think I'm ready for anything more.<eos> Emily, I have been alone for 13 years.<eos> And I was fine with that... until I met you.<eos> And now, I just can't imagine it any other way.<eos> Is that too quick? Maybe. But when you know, you just know.<eos> Now, come on, let's not waste any more time.<eos> Let's just jump on this train, and see where it takes us.
I used his gun.<eos> He hid it on your boat to protect me.<eos> They're not your friends, Jack.<eos> They want payback.<eos> Needless to say, you were right to keep Daniel in the dark this afternoon.<eos> The boy will soon run the company toward the ground, proving little use to the Initiative.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> I think he handled himself very well today.<eos> Seemingly.<eos> But his vaulting ambition will bring him down as swiftly as it propped him up.
I thought I'd surprise you.<eos> Getting to be a habit.<eos> We can finish up later.<eos> You have your official face on.<eos> So what's my surprise?<eos> Four organized crime members of the Rulanti family were arrested today for the attempted murder of the head of the Spolarno family.<eos> And?<eos> And not one of the arresting officers was able to tell me where the tip came from.<eos> Maybe they didn't know.<eos> Did it come from you?
Jeez, someone's a princess.<eos> Man, they are never gonna be able to rent this place now.<eos> I'm gonna go over to my store and put blood on the walls so Max will like it more.<eos> Max, look around.<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Yup.<eos> The shooter stood here, and, based on the blood splatter, he was short and walked with a limp.<eos> And his name was Mad Dog.<eos> 'Cause I want that to be his name.<eos> No, Max, you know how we've always wanted our own shop?<eos> This is it.
Body heat sensor in the ceiling could be coated with hair spray, buy a little time, which brings us to... the door itself, yes.<eos> She is beautiful, hmm.<eos> This lock is not pickable.<eos> That key is, what, a foot long?<eos> The tumblers are weighted so they cannot be manipulated with a pick.<eos> You could, of course, put a tiny camera on this fire extinguisher.<eos> If you knew an excellent locksmith, you could provide an image of the key, have it duplicated.<eos> Clever, but we already knew that.<eos> Ten-digit access code?<eos> Yes, it's provided by a random number generator that's hardwired into the system.

Come on! Move!<eos> Go on!<eos> Go on!<eos> Move on! Pull!<eos> What the heck are you doing?<eos> Buy a dress for your wife!<eos> Greetings, Marat.<eos> - Hello, Marduni.<eos> - Are you making a sail?<eos> - Take this fabric, it's rugged.
Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?<eos> Why would it trouble you?<eos> It's, like, your third favorite cartoon theme song.
Mom?<eos> You been drinking, Carter?<eos> Tell Harold, Donnelly is headed to Wall Street.<eos> He says John is there.<eos> He's tracking the phones.<eos> Okay, mom. Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Hey, it's Fusco.<eos> Wherever wonderboy is, I hope it's not near Wall Street, because that's where Donnelly's heading.
I put a call in to get a roster...<eos> Agh! Evan? Evan, are you okay?<eos> Evan!<eos> Evan!<eos> Evan!<eos> Whoever this sob was, He was bold enough to kidnap one of our own. We're in a race against the clock.<eos> Found evan's phone in the bell tower.<eos> From what he told me, we're looking for someone<eos> Who was planning this murder for a while now. We think this cadaver was a trial run.<eos> It got into evan's computers.
-lt has started again -What?<eos> -What?<eos> -l thought it was over<eos> I'm here.<eos> Don't worry<eos> What's happening?<eos> Look<eos> Look at that<eos> The level has gone down<eos> And it's still falling
we caught two kids digging up a grave.<eos> Shall I take care of it?<eos> They were digging up a grave?<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> It wasn't about desecrating a grave. Was it?<eos> What were you looking for?<eos> It was Camille Séguret's grave.<eos> Did you know her?<eos> Where is the body?<eos> It wasn't in the coffin.

We'll be the two evicted girls eating fruitcake out of a Dumpster.<eos> Oh, look, here comes one of the reindeers now.<eos> You look like a Korean coat rack.<eos> Everybody can stop looking.<eos> We found the Grinch.<eos> No wonder it's so angry, it's working for minimum wage.<eos> Oh, you're hanging the Christmas decorations.<eos> I already put up the mistletoe.<eos> Where?<eos> Let's just say it's very well-hung.
Shall I say hello to your mother?<eos> The doctor will be right there.<eos> His kidneys malfunction.<eos> He has fever and water in his arms and legs.<eos> Besides, and this bothers me the most, his heart has been damaged.<eos> And what do you do to help him?<eos> We've connected him to the dialysis.<eos> That's all we can do for him right now. One moment, please.<eos> Watch out for the turn!<eos> The car has to handle that, otherwise it's rubbish.
Yes, of course.<eos> Did Vincent ask you to come?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll take you to the hotel, we'll go get him later.<eos> Just a moment Just a story<eos> Just a happy love<eos> Nice, huh?<eos> I like this song.<eos> Me, too.<eos> It was on Vincent's tape.
Take it easy! Let's talk this out.<eos> Come on!<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Oh, a pea-shooter, eh?<eos> - Yeah, I'll fix you.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Hey!<eos> Where's your hypocritical oath?<eos> Here it is.
You'll be happy.<eos> - Is that everything?<eos> - Half.<eos> The rest is coming.<eos> No rush. In the meantime, it's creeping up.<eos> - Bye, Mario.<eos> - Bye.<eos> I've heard so much about this class.<eos> I heard so much about this class.<eos> Apparently it's amazing.
Sophie Decarie.<eos> Into 5th, and 1st.<eos> Relax.<eos> Good.<eos> And again.<eos> Careful. The left arm in 2nd position.<eos> And first.<eos> Right arm in 5th.<eos> I've heard so much about this class.<eos> Apparently it's amazing.
How was it when you found me?<eos> The terrace door was open.<eos> I came closer.<eos> That's when I saw you... downstairs.<eos> On your computer, there was a message.<eos> "Goodbye.<eos> Forgive me."<eos> It must be awful for you.<eos> And my computer?<eos> I'm not sure where it is.
Vice President of the Confederacy, the former Secretary of State and their Assistant Secretary of War.<eos> They're coming in earnest to propose peace.<eos> I know this is unwelcome news for you.<eos> Now hear me.<eos> I went to Richmond to talk to traitors.<eos> To smile at and plead with traitors because it'll be spring in two months.<eos> The roads will be passable, the spring slaughter commences.<eos> Four bloody springs now.<eos> Think of my Frank, whom you've taken to your heart.<eos> How you'll blame yourself if the war takes my son as it's taken multitudes of sons.
And I look a lot worse without my wig.<eos> The people elected me to represent them, to lead them, and I lead.<eos> I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens and I have tried to profit from the example of it, but if I'd listened to you, I'd have declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter.<eos> And the border states would have gone over to the Confederacy, the war would have been lost and the Union along with it, and instead of abolishing slavery as we hope to do in two weeks, we'd be watching, helpless as infants, as it spread<eos> from the American South into South America. Oh, how you have longed to say that to me.<eos> You claim you trust them, but you know what the people are.<eos> You know that the inner compass, that should direct the soul towards justice has ossified in white men and women, North and South, unto utter uselessness, through tolerating the evil of slavery.<eos> White people cannot bear the thought of sharing this country's infinite abundance with Negroes.<eos> A compass, I learned when I was surveying, it'll point you true north from where you're standing.<eos> But it's got no advice about the swamps and deserts and chasms that you'll encounter along the way.
Or I will feel ashamed of myself for the rest of my life!<eos> Whether or not you fought is what's gonna matter, and not just to other people, but to myself!<eos> I won't be you, Pa, I can't do that, but I don't want to be nothing!<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> He'll be fine, Molly.<eos> City Point's a way back from the front lines and the fighting.<eos> He'll be an adjutant, running messages for General Grant.<eos> The war will take our son.<eos> A sniper, or a shrapnel shell, a typhus same as took Willie.<eos> It takes hundreds of boys a day.
He wasn't a kind man but there was a rough, moral urge for fairness, for freedom in him.<eos> I learnt that from him, I suppose.<eos> If little else from him.<eos> We didn't care for one another, Mr. Yeaman.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Loving kindness, that most ordinary thing, came to me from other sources. I'm grateful for that.<eos> Well, I hate it, too, sir.<eos> Slavery, but... But we're entirely unready for emancipation.<eos> And there's too many questions...<eos> We're unready for peace, too, ain't we?<eos> Yeah, when it comes, it'll present us with conundrums and dangers greater than any we faced during the war, bloody as it's been.
So, you're a Christian and a Muslim?<eos> And a Hindu, of course.<eos> And a Jew, I suppose.<eos> Well, I do teach a course on the Kabbalah at the university.<eos> And why not? Faith is a house with many rooms.<eos> But no room for doubt?<eos> Oh, plenty.<eos> On every floor.<eos> Doubt is useful.<eos> It keeps faith a living thing.
Our ship, The Tsimtsum, pushed on, bullishly indifferent to its surroundings.<eos> It moved with the slow, massive confidence of a continent.<eos> Ravi?<eos> Did you hear that, Ravi?<eos> I'm sleeping.<eos> It's a thunderstorm.<eos> Let's go watch.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> We will get hit by lightning.<eos> No, we won't. It will hit the bridge first.
I would have been lost, alone forever.<eos> Even when God seemed to have abandoned me... He was watching.<eos> Even when He seemed indifferent to my suffering... He was watching.<eos> And when I was beyond all hope of saving, He gave me rest... then gave me a sign to continue my journey.<eos> By the time we reached the Mexican shore, I was afraid to let go of the boat.<eos> My strength was gone.<eos> I was so weak.<eos> I was afraid that in two feet of water, so close to deliverance.. I would drown.<eos> I struggled to shore and fell upon the sand.<eos> It was warm and soft... like pressing my face against the cheek of God.
You know it ain't gonna be no fun without me.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> You stay on, Red Four.<eos> You stay on, but you keep an eye on it, all right?<eos> Thank you, sweetheart.<eos> Just my luck I get stuck with the flying wreck.<eos> Another P-40 from Uncle Sam's junkyard.<eos> It looks like we got a truck up there.<eos> It's got German markings.
I'll say this, Jack. Even when your hope is false, it sure is grand.<eos> I'm serious, A.J. I can get that for you.<eos> If you stick your neck out how far?<eos> I don't want you to put your career on the line for me, Jack.<eos> A little less tin on my uniform is the least of it.<eos> If I get you the mission, your men have got to put something on the board.<eos> They come through, or Mortamus and the brass will have all they need to shut the whole thing down.<eos> You get us that mission, we will light up the board.<eos> Has this flight order been verified?<eos> Yes, sir. It came directly from Colonel Bullard in Washington.
I'm running low on fuel.<eos> And what if you turn up missing?<eos> Then I'll have to break it to Major Stance.<eos> Well, break it to him gently.<eos> Great, great, great!<eos> One's a drunk, and the other one does whatever the hell he wants to do.<eos> Smokey, stay with him.<eos> And keep him out of trouble. Don't worry.<eos> I'll stick with him.<eos> My head, it hurts.
You're protecting those people.<eos> I'm not.<eos> You were welcomed amongst us.<eos> You had a good life here.<eos> If I got to where I am, it's because I earned it. And because we made it possible.<eos> I don't know, Amin.<eos> It seems to me everything you used to say in the past...<eos> Was false?<eos> Maybe convenient.<eos> I don't think you can live in a place, enjoy the best of what it has to offer, and then refuse to defend it.
If someone followed you at the river today, it was probably a cop.<eos> And I highly doubt...<eos> There are three things cops never do.<eos> They don't vote Democrat, they don't drive Cadillacs, and they never use personal vehicles.<eos> It's not a cop.<eos> A P.l., then, or the D.A.'s office.<eos> You think your father's office would set me up?<eos> Why would anyone set you up?<eos> How was your day?<eos> It went exactly the way I think you hoped it would.
The motive.<eos> Just hold onto it.<eos> What are we playing, Clue?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You sure that car was following you all day?<eos> As soon as you picked me up.<eos> Why?<eos> It's registered to a company called Lebendauer Enterprises.
Why the fuck did you shoot me?<eos> You would have bled to death.<eos> A man might take the news of his own death... Badly.<eos> I felt for the kid, I really did.<eos> But I couldn't just leave him to die.<eos> Me, I had unfinished business at my place of my own resurrection.<eos> I figured, if I ever made it back, I would tell him about the time when I died.<eos> It was over.<eos> My death meant nothing.<eos> But to my mother, it was everything.
I'm sorry I low balled you. Well, you did.<eos> That was a serious low ball.<eos> I'm not a crack whore.<eos> You're the one who said having sex with me was like a job.<eos> I never said that. You said that.<eos> You weren't thinking it?<eos> No.<eos> It felt like it.<eos> It's not what I was thinking, because I'll tell you, sex with you is-- it's beautiful, you know.<eos> And it's wonderful. And it's amazing.
Finally, someone who speaks English.<eos> Is that what just happened?<eos> It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.<eos> Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.<eos> And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage-monster.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Dr. Banner is only here to track the Cube.<eos> I was hoping you might join him.<eos> I would start with that stick of his.<eos> It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.

Try to think!<eos> Okay, the relays are intact.<eos> What's our next move?<eos> Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump.<eos> I'm going to have to get in there and push.<eos> If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.<eos> That stator control unit can reverse the polarity long enough to disengage maglev and that could...<eos> Speak English!<eos> You see that red lever?<eos> It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.
Stark, we're losing altitude.<eos> Yeah, I noticed.<eos> No!<eos> Are you ever not going to fall for that?<eos> The humans think us immortal.<eos> Should we test that?<eos> Move away, please.<eos> You like this?<eos> We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer.<eos> Even I don't know what it does.
Hmm.<eos> Oh.<eos> Ah.<eos> Good morning.<eos> To think that I should have lived to be "good morninged"... by Belladonna Took's son as if I were selling buttons at the door.<eos> Beg your pardon?<eos> You've changed, and not entirely for the better...<eos> Bilbo Baggins.<eos> I'm sorry, do I know you?<eos> Well, you know my name, although you don't remember I belong to it.
(SPEAKS IN DWARVISH)<eos> GANDALF:<eos> Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.<eos> We appear to be one Dwarf short.<eos> He is late, is all.<eos> He traveled north to a meeting of our kin.<eos> He will come.<eos> Mr. Gandalf?<eos> A little glass of red wine, as requested.<eos> It's got a fruity bouquet.
Sauron is vanquished.<eos> He can never regain his full strength.<eos> Does it not worry you that the last of the Dwarf rings... should simply vanish... along with it's bearer?<eos> Of the seven Dwarf rings, four were consumed by dragons... two were taken by Sauron before he fell in Mordor.<eos> The fate of the last Dwarf ring remains unknown.<eos> The ring that was worn by Thrain.<eos> Without the ruling Ring of Power... the seven are of no value to the enemy.<eos> To control... the other rings... he needs the One.<eos> And that ring was lost long, long ago.<eos> It was swept out... to sea by the waters of the Anduin.
There is a newspaper article.<eos> Fire in the coal mines got out of control.<eos> The whole place is still burning, deep underground.<eos> Everyone had to leave.<eos> My dad doesn't believe that, though.<eos> No?<eos> He says the town was cursed by the power of a demon child. Her name's Alessa.<eos> This Order tried to cleanse her with fire, but they failed.<eos> And Alessa's revenge was to summon a world of darkness, filled with terrifying creatures.<eos> This one, it says, is her "guardian and executioner."
I need something fresh, something different.<eos> Without expensive stars to pretty it up.<eos> Fox is offering you The Diary of Anne Frank for the third time.<eos> The audience would spend the entire picture... waiting for Miss Frank to discover the corpse I'd hidden in the attic.<eos> - Wouldn't you agree, Nunzio? - Sì.<eos> MGM wants you for the Ian Fleming book<eos> Casino Royale, with Cary Grant.<eos> Definitely your style.<eos> Doesn't she know I just made that movie?<eos> It was called North by Northwest.
I'm not talking of blame.<eos> Whit must have enjoyed writing for Colbert.<eos> How was the beach?<eos> Cold and miserable.<eos> Just like Barney Balaban's face.<eos> Poor old Whit.<eos> He isn't worth a damn when he's not working with you.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> I couldn't pull off the picture this time.<eos> It just sits there.
'Oh, I'm so sorry but we, the group were feeling...'<eos> D'you know, one of the great problems of our age... is that we are governed by people who care... more about feelings than thoughts and ideas.<eos> Now thoughts and ideas. That interests me.<eos> Ask me what I am thinking-<eos> What are you thinking, Margaret?<eos> Watch your thoughts, for they become words.<eos> Watch your words, for they become actions.<eos> Watch your actions, for they become habits.<eos> Watch your habits, for they become your character.<eos> And watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.
You'll go back to your chick.<eos> That's what you'll do. That's your thing.<eos> I'd rather busk in a subway than waste my life just--<eos> Whatever, man.<eos> - Oh, pick up, come on.<eos> Lynn?<eos> Hey. It's me.<eos> Yeah, at work.<eos> Is the power out with you?<eos> Yeah, it's out here too.
But nothing was the same.<eos> August was right again.<eos> Everything is an illusion.<eos> Come on!<eos> With straw house sell-outs, August promised the men he'd finally pay them with increases, once his debts were covered.<eos> Success had made a new man out of August, they all said.<eos> But I watched him, and I knew it was just a matter of time.<eos> Shh! Children.<eos> The circus is nothing without its traditions.<eos> It's a family.
Riley?<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Not following me, are you?<eos> Following?<eos> No, no I...<eos> You're okay?<eos> I'm good.<eos> So where's your bus?<eos> It left us behind. A long time ago...
He was giving a...<eos> I don't know, something in Madrid.<eos> I went there and then followed him here.<eos> Can't I come in?<eos> No, I'm not allowed visitors.<eos> It smells good.<eos> I'm hungary.<eos> Brute!<eos> The main new items today... are the Carnival celebrations... and the daring robbery commited in the Bvlgari jewelry store... in the heart of Madrid.<eos> It happened last night... and today we have the first images recorded by one... of the twenty-four security cameras which protect the jewelry store.
- Why not?<eos> - I haven't got the key.<eos> Does Marilia have it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> If you scream, I'll break your jaw.<eos> Where's the key to upstairs?<eos> In the drawer at the corner.<eos> Untie me and I'll give it to you.<eos> No, where is it?
What?<eos> Lets fuck in the garden, please!<eos> The garden?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm sick of screwing in the open air.<eos> This tiger wants a bed.<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> You're hurting me.<eos> It's very big.<eos> It's like it always was.

HERMIONE:<eos> No!<eos> You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord in the last few hours alone.<eos> VOLDEMORT:<eos> No.<eos> No, I am extraordinary but the wand resists me.<eos> SNAPE:<eos> There is no wand more powerful.<eos> Ollivander himself has said it.<eos> Tonight, when the boy comes, it will not fail you. I am sure of it.

Where would you say that we are?<eos> Well it looks like King's Cross station.<eos> Only cleaner. And without all the trains.<eos> King's Cross, is that right?<eos> This is, as they say, your party.<eos> I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate since that night in Godric's Hollow all those years ago.<eos> So it's true then, sir?<eos> A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?<eos> Did.<eos> It was just destroyed many moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
(HISSING NEARBY)<eos> (WHOOSH)<eos> (YELLS)<eos> (HISSES)<eos> Not my daughter, you bitch.<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> (VOLDEMORT YELLS)<eos> HARRY:<eos> You were right when you told Snape that wand was failing you.<eos> It will always fail you.
Let's finish this the way we started it.<eos> Together.<eos> (BOTH YELLING)<eos> (YELLS)<eos> (STUDENTS CHATTERING)<eos> - Ha, ha.<eos> - I always figured he would be a big fellow.<eos> I couldn't find my wand.<eos> I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.<eos> It was lost in the folds of my gowns.
- I always figured he would be a big fellow.<eos> I couldn't find my wand.<eos> I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.<eos> It was lost in the folds of my gowns.<eos> I managed to find it and I dispatched a few of them...<eos> HAGRID:<eos> Harry.<eos> (HAGRID CHUCKLES)<eos> HERMIONE:<eos> Why didn't it work for him, the Elder Wand?
(HAGRID CHUCKLES)<eos> HERMIONE:<eos> Why didn't it work for him, the Elder Wand?<eos> It answered to somebody else.<eos> When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his.<eos> But the thing is, the wand never belonged to Snape.<eos> It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night in the astronomy tower.<eos> From that moment on, the wand answered to him.<eos> Until the other night when I disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.<eos> So that means... it's mine.
Will you hold me?<eos> Will you hold me, please?<eos> No...<eos> Please... Heavenly Father, help me.<eos> Dear Hannah. It's taken me a while to put this together.<eos> I'm not so great at writing letters, but I wanted to get in touch.<eos> Life's been mad for me in the past 12 months.<eos> Been awful sick for a number of reasons.<eos> I don't know if it got in the papers to you, but Samuel got attacked by that dog.<eos> That fucking cunt who was seeing to his mother got the doggy wound up so much that it turned on the nearest thing to it.
I think we can both agree you cannot be the celebrity of sandwiches.<eos> You mind not looking over here for a little while?<eos> That don't match.<eos> What?<eos> That don't match unless you're a hooker.<eos> Oh, so now I'm a hooker?<eos> Well, darn you're too ripe is all.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I said you're too ripe and your mouth is too big.<eos> Well, like it's to big in general or like I talk too much?
Lightning McQueen blew this race.<eos> Team McQueen can't be happy right now.<eos> Welcome to Tokyo International Airport.<eos> - Come with me, please, sir.<eos> - But I'm 'onna miss my plane.<eos> - Right this way.<eos> - Ah, doggone it.<eos> This is about my hook, ain't it?<eos> I know I should have checked it, but I can't, really.<eos> Look. It's attached to me.
A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed.<eos> Agent?<eos> You mean, like, insurance agent?<eos> Like...<eos> Like a good neighbor, Mater is there!<eos> Wait!<eos> You mean secret agents!<eos> You guys is spies!<eos> In how many makes and models did this type of engine appear?<eos> It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period.
- Shit.<eos> - There ain't gonna be nothing left.<eos> - l think I got a way out of here.<eos> - What'd you say?<eos> Right here, look. 200 metres out.<eos> - What's right behind that backside?<eos> - Lieutenant, we got a bus.<eos> - Roger that.<eos> So the men on the roof saw a bus.<eos> They think it could be operational.
They think it could be operational.<eos> Maybe we'd be better off on foot.<eos> It's miles to the operating base and those bombs are gonna drop in an hour.<eos> We gotta move fast.<eos> Bus is a big target.<eos> I made the call.<eos> It's my responsibility.<eos> Stavrou, Harris.<eos> Lieutenant needs recon on a bus.<eos> If it runs, get it back here.
Put simply, world destruction is an unpleasant, but necessary part of evolution.<eos> What happens then, I wondered, when mankind faces the next end of the world?<eos> I don't care what you have to do to get him to Dubai.<eos> I'll make it worth his while.<eos> Just do it.<eos> I looked to Hiroshima, Nagasaki...<eos> I'll be waiting for your call.<eos> ...thriving cities rebuilt from the ashes, monuments to the unimaginable, dedicated to the concept of peace.<eos> It occurred to me here that nuclear war might have a place in the natural order.<eos> But only if it could be controlled.

Very good.<eos> Now, we're going to make a press.<eos> Shut the book up.<eos> Butterfly.<eos> And what was it before it was a butterfly?<eos> Caterpillar.<eos> "I shall leave and walk into town."<eos> "Do not go," begged her maid. "The Gytrash roams these hills."<eos> A spirit of the North that lies in wait for travelers.<eos> It tenants the carcasses of beasts, possesses horses, wolves, great dogs.
Who were you before them?<eos> What was so bad about that man then that makes you resist your desires now?<eos> Thomas...<eos> I am not a sin.<eos> Sire?<eos> Sire?<eos> Your engineer, sire.<eos> The mine is ready.<eos> Will it work?<eos> - it's right under the keep's foundations.
The Order's over for you, Thomas.<eos> You've earned your freedom as much as any man.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> Come on.<eos> We held.<eos> Within a year, the rebellion was won.<eos> While fleeing for his life, King John died of dysentery.<eos> What was left of his treasure was never recovered.<eos> In time, the great keep of Rochester was rebuilt.<eos> It stands to this day.
That's ok.<eos> And what operating system are you running?<eos> Ok, great. Can you go to mail?<eos> And then click on preferences.<eos> Now read to me what it says there.<eos> There you go.<eos> Is there anything else I can help you with today?<eos> Thank you for calling horizicom. Have a nice day.<eos> How was class?<eos> It was cancelled.
I'm just a rock in the sky.<eos> Ok.<eos> Start it up.<eos> Me? I was waiting for you to do it.<eos> What, so this is it?<eos> It's just this from now on?<eos> I guess so.<eos> Well, what about...<eos> Did this day already happen? Moon:<eos> That day would be today, but it's almost over.
Wizard?<eos> If you could keep a secret, it was Leezar.<eos> Leezar?<eos> I understand he's a very dangerous man.<eos> Duh. That's why Fabious turned to me.<eos> The most bold and brave and honorable man that he knows.<eos> We aim to kill the magical cocksucker.<eos> Do you see this compass?<eos> What a fascinating device.<eos> It will lead us to a labyrinth which holds a blade.
Yes.<eos> I could make it devour people or breathe fire over the Kingdom of Mourne.<eos> Sounds flimsy.<eos> First of all, you obviously don't know jack shit about the prophecy.<eos> How do you know that it won't be me who controls the dragon?<eos> Because I am the chosen one.<eos> Chosen one controls the dragon.<eos> Those are the rules, basically.<eos> What are you laughing at?<eos> I was just thinking about your penis and how unusual it must look.

Really?<eos> And if your vagina is anything like my hand there will be no problem.<eos> Fair warriors, arise.<eos> Two days before the eclipse.<eos> Thadeous, hand me the compass so I can check its shadow.<eos> What?<eos> The compass.<eos> That's weird.<eos> It was around my neck when I slept.<eos> Where is it, Thadeous?
Isabel!<eos> Shit.<eos> Thadeous, you didn't by chance tell her anything about the nature of our quest, did you?<eos> I may have dropped a few minor details.<eos> Did you tell Isabel anything about the one-of-a-kind mythical compass?<eos> Gods!<eos> She's run off with the compass.<eos> We don't know that for sure.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Where is it?
So, who were those handsome men you were talking to?<eos> My contacts.<eos> Mmm.<eos> By contacts do you mean men you trick into liking you so you can fuck them over?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> The compass.<eos> Hand it over now.<eos> You lied.<eos> It does nothing.
Even the opening scene, there's always some random girl who gets a call that undoubtedly... ends up getting her killed.<eos> It's all so predictable. There's no element of surprise.<eos> You can see everything coming.<eos> Did that surprise you?<eos> It's your own fault.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because you talk too much.<eos> Now shut the fuck up and watch the movie.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> I love it. I've seen it five times, and it still gets me every time.
Tonight, we're decorating the tree.<eos> Oh, Daddy, I wanted to spend tonight in the city with you guys.<eos> Wait.<eos> I got this.<eos> I'll take care of the tree.<eos> You have a family night in Manhattan.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We brought the tree all the way down.<eos> It has to look perfect on Christmas morning.
Stop yelling!<eos> We gotta get rid of this tree!<eos> Okay.<eos> That's why you gotta buy those faux trees.<eos> They last forever.<eos> [PANTING]<eos> Calm down.<eos> It's just a Christmas tree.<eos> "Just a Christmas tree"?<eos> Maria's dad grew that tree and now it is dead.
Dude, it's the balls.<eos> These dirty Jew bastards have no idea what they're missing.<eos> Fishing! Hunting! I tie knots on a sailboat.<eos> I made terrible investments doesn't bother me a bit.<eos> And guess what. Next week I have an appointment to get uncircumcised.<eos> That's right, I'm gonna get my snozzle.<eos> Guys, I'd love to stay and chat but I gotta go get this tree.<eos> Christmas tree!<eos> Christmas tree!<eos> It's glorious. isn't it Christian?
No.<eos> I've been texting you. I haven 't heard back.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Tell him I'm not gonna make it to his party tomorrow.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, you're not gonna make it--<eos> She won't make it to your party.<eos> What else have you been doing behind my back?<eos> Has she seen your dick?<eos> Is it bigger than mine?
I'm just teasing you.<eos> I do it too.<eos> [LAUGHS]<eos> On, Prancer!<eos> On, Comet!<eos> On, Blitzen!<eos> Hyah! Merry Christmas, Roldy!<eos> MR. PEREZ:<eos> Where's the tree?<eos> It's, um ...
You needed my help last night.<eos> It's not just me you're walking away from.<eos> Here you have the chance to be part of something much bigger than yourself.<eos> I won't stop you leaving.<eos> I could.<eos> But I won't.<eos> Shaw has got friends.<eos> You could do with some.<eos> Hank turned that radar installation into a transmitter.<eos> It's designed to amplify brainwaves so it could enhance your telepathic powers, help us find other mutants for our division.
- All right, all right.<eos> Jesus, man, you are killing me.<eos> Don't beat yourself up.<eos> I've had a lot of spare time.<eos> I didn't know the circus was in town.<eos> Hey, come on, honey.<eos> Give us a little...<eos> No?<eos> Come on, let's see the foot.<eos> There it is.
It's nearly gotten you killed all this time.<eos> Come here.<eos> Let's try something a little more challenging.<eos> My stepfather took the possibility of nuclear war quite seriously.<eos> This way.<eos> That is why he had this bunker built down here.<eos> I thought we could use it as a practice range of sorts.<eos> You don't think I'm going to blow through the walls?<eos> He had this place built to withstand a nuclear bomb.<eos> I think it can handle you, Alex.
- Damn it, Mom.<eos> - I told you I could handle this.<eos> - I just want to ask her something.<eos> You truly love my son?<eos> I love him so much it hurts.<eos> - All right, then.<eos> When is his birthday? - Mom.<eos> I'm not, you know...<eos> That is just offensive that you would even ask me that.<eos> It's today.
Blackbeard will meet his death within a fortnight at the hands of a one-legged man.<eos> That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.<eos> Oh, master Gibbs, short we are a map.<eos> Perhaps you'd be so kind as to provide us an heading.<eos> Be a gem and pour me a gulper.<eos> Nay. We be privateers, not pirates, master Gibbs.<eos> And in the King's name, we behave as such.<eos> Aye... captain.<eos> - Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?<eos> - Aye, it be proper.
It's not my birthday.<eos> Please.<eos> Come on. Josemaría, as your brother, I have been chosen... to ask you to celebrate our second year together... by removing your shoes.<eos> Yes, Father!<eos> - Take them off.<eos> - Take off your shoes.<eos> Come on, Father. - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Behold a simple shoe.<eos> But is it what it seems? - Yes.
-Yet.<eos> -Edward.<eos> It's breaking her bones now.<eos> It's crushing you from the inside out.<eos> Carlisle, tell her what you told me.<eos> Tell her.<eos> Carlisle, tell me.<eos> It's all right.<eos> The fetus isn't compatible with your body.<eos> It's too strong.

But being with strangers?<eos> I didn't understand, but gradually I learned everything.<eos> Don't do everything a client asks of you.<eos> Tell him: "I sell my body but not my soul."<eos> Politely say: "You may use me up to a certain point."<eos> "I cannot go beyond my limits."<eos> "I am not a slave you can buy. "Understand?<eos> "You cannot cross the lines I have set."<eos> If a client wants you to put his cock into your mouth, say: "No, my mouth is holy.<eos> It recites the Sutras of the Koran."
Oh.<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.<eos> No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.<eos> - Which was where, exactly?<eos> Grand Central.<eos> You had your first date at Grand Central Station.<eos> It wasn't a shabby affair.<eos> I'd hired out the entire place.<eos> It was deserted.
Come in, Naomi.<eos> Come in.<eos> Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...<eos> - I can see why.<eos> - But, actually, why don't we...?<eos> - This is amazing.<eos> - Uh, no. Um...<eos> - That fish looks like a cat.<eos> ARTHUR: Naomi.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Good, a horse cock is a great thing<eos> Horse cock. Are you sure you're capable of doing the surgery?<eos> what?<eos> Are you discriminating against the disabled?<eos> Before the surgery There are two rules that we have to strictly adhere to<eos> First<eos> The surgery has to be done within the time when an incense stick burns lf we run late your newly attached cock will be useless<eos> Or, you'd have no cock at all<eos> Second<eos> You cannot have sex in one month otherwise, it'd really be useless
Either of you can give me your cock!<eos> It won't work even if I am willing to lf l am willing to give up my cock I don't have hands to do the operation lf l give up my cock no one can run errands for me<eos> we don't have enough time.<eos> That's right<eos> Don't tell me it's my fate that I have no cock<eos> Hey, hold it!<eos> is your donkey a male?<eos> The donkey, hey!<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> If it is male, we will buy it no matter how much we can repay what we owe you
Over the last couple of years, I disguise myself as a woman and sneak into senior officials' residences to fool around with their kids<eos> Now I am a wanted person only this metal plate can help me<eos> Metal plate...is it the one that people call it "The Golden Plate of Death Avoidance"?<eos> Hmm...<eos> So...how do I steal it?<eos> where does The Prince hide his most precious items?<eos> (what a luck that they are all drunk...)<eos> (wow, what arrogance to keep the key around his dick! )<eos> (Shit!<eos> It fucking stucks! )
Anything else is out of the question.<eos> You'll get some fresh air.<eos> Feel this, Isak. This is how smooth it's going to be.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Thank you, Karin...<eos> It's Erik. It's him you should thank.<eos> What the hell...<eos> Are you alright?<eos> ...and then we'll put a round rod here.<eos> It should fit on the edge of the rudder. You see?
We've done damn well without you.<eos> What are you so afraid of?<eos> It's not a bad idea.<eos> A shipyard.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Don't dismiss it just because Ruben came up with it.<eos> Hello, kids.<eos> I'm done with the keel now. How do we go about the planking? Let me see.<eos> Oh my... You're almost getting good at this, huh?<eos> You've designed the keel just the way it should be, right.
Give me some fork.<eos> All right, let's let this shirt start over!<eos> Okay, two more left.<eos> A good one.<eos> Oldie but a goodie.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Mommy used to wear that sometimes.<eos> She did.<eos> This was a...<eos> It started out as mine, but she kind of adopted it.

- You work there?<eos> I do, and I also own it.<eos> Strange but true.<eos> - We bought a zoo!<eos> - Throttle down.<eos> I love that zoo!<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, my...<eos> We used to go there all the time!<eos> - Is it gonna open again soon?
Detective Forgeat?<eos> It is his assistant, Stéphane Defer.<eos> I want to talk Forgeat.<eos> He is on the way.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Who are you? They know there is another body?<eos> A body?<eos> Where?<eos> His name is Kourosh.<eos> It is Iranian.
That's not healthy.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> [GRUNTING]<eos> PUP 2:<eos> Daddy, what are you doing...<eos> - ...down there?<eos> - Get back up here.<eos> Not sure I can.<eos> There is a way... but you won't like it.
- Oh, yeah?<eos> I'll be back in like... an hour.<eos> Have fun.<eos> I'm just getting some yogurt.<eos> God, I am single as fuck.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It looks like it's coming right at me.<eos> Hey, one more thing.<eos> Don't call my penis cute.<eos> Even if it's dressed up like a Care Bear, and it's giving you a Care Stare.
Oh, this? I just threw it together.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, hey, Adam!<eos> Adam.<eos> Hello!<eos> Lucy.<eos> Yeah, we were just having a romantic night when your friend stopped by from work.<eos> Usually I spend Valentine's Day catching up on work and stuff, but this is like, this is really fun.<eos> How was your night?<eos> Yeah, it wasn't.
What...?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm so...<eos> It's the wrong guy. Sir.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, there's been a mistake.<eos> He brought the wrong guy.<eos> That's not Teddy.<eos> Of course it is.
Yes, she comes from a different community, but she's smart and she's beautiful,<eos> and I love her. "<eos> I don't know who he's talking about.<eos> Sunaina, I may have no right to judge, but I have a mother's right to worry.<eos> Take care of my favorite son.<eos> Sorry. I'm not clear now.<eos> Am I staying or going ?<eos> - Well, it depends how you read the accounts.<eos> - The accounts ? It turns out the original plan for the hotel is good.<eos> It works.
We'll be back home in the wobble of a reindeer's buttocks.<eos> And Evie can go back in mothballs.<eos> You can forget she ever existed.<eos> You can't just go home.<eos> What about Gwen?<eos> Gwen. For that, you'd threaten my whole operation?<eos> Steve, you said if there was any way to get there, you would. Well, this is it.<eos> Look.<eos> The old sleigh is perfect! Right.<eos> Well, anyway, it goes really fast, even with bits missing.
- L looked it up for me on the Internet.<eos> The code is to leave a five foot passage.<eos> What can I do?<eos> You can't see it anymore because I spent hours cleaning everything with white vinegar and a toothbrush.<eos> But you can see it on the TV here.<eos> Oh. Wow, well, I can have the guys working on my project come by and clean up for you.<eos> L hardly think that a, a laborer who hammers and saws all day would know how to clean my house.<eos> Yeah, you might be right about that.<eos> And this has been very, very hard on me.<eos> L mean, with all this dust just, it's just floating around.
Like all day... ... L 'mfantasizing about her dying.<eos> L must've imagined it a hundred different ways.<eos> Actually, last night, I had a dream about it.<eos> A wish fulfillment dream, huh, doc?<eos> L guess so.<eos> What was it?<eos> Lt was ridiculous.<eos> These two football players are runnin' through the woods in the park by my house where l sometimes go jogging and I see her walking her little dog every night at dusk.<eos> They're just galloping through the woods in full game day uniforms. One of 'em hurls a ball through the air.<eos> As it sails, I realize it's an arrow. Lt splits her head wide open.
And, um, -He said...<eos> -We don't know.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> Everyone is dying of cancer These days.<eos> Why would you try to figure it out And put yourself out of a job?<eos> I know this is rough, but we need To talk about what to do next.<eos> I'm going to consult with the head Of the oncology department, Dr Sanders.<eos> Can, can, can you just take it out, So I can go on with my life?<eos> No, unfortunately we can't.<eos> It's already spread Throughout the entire colon,
It'd be half a day's ride before anyone knows we're gone.<eos> I'll race you.<eos> [BELL TOLLING]<eos> [HORSES WHINNYING]<eos> The wolf.<eos> MAN:<eos> This way!<eos> Over here!<eos> [CROWD CHATTERING]<eos> It killed again.
[HORSES WHINNYING]<eos> The wolf.<eos> MAN:<eos> This way!<eos> Over here!<eos> [CROWD CHATTERING]<eos> It killed again.<eos> But we've kept the peace.<eos> Well, the wolf has broken it.<eos> Who is it?
I have a trade.<eos> The same one as your husband.<eos> I know what a woodcutter earns.<eos> Henry's her only hope for a better life.<eos> If you love her you'll let her go.<eos> We've all seen the bones on the trail to Mount Grimmoor.<eos> That's where the wolf makes its lair.<eos> BARKEEP:<eos> We know the weaknesses of the werewolf.<eos> It can't come out in daylight. It can't step onto holy ground.
We lived in a village like this.<eos> And like Daggerhorn ours was plagued by a werewolf.<eos> One full moon, my friends and I got drunk.<eos> We decided to hunt it.<eos> It never occurred to us that we might actually find it, but find it we did.<eos> It ripped my best friend in half.<eos> Quickly.<eos> And then it was on me.<eos> I hacked and hacked at it with my axe.<eos> Suddenly it was gone.
-No, I don't deny it.<eos> And what was the nature of this conversation?<eos> It promised to leave Daggerhorn in peace as long as I go with it.<eos> The wolf is someone in this village who wants you, Valerie.<eos> Do you know who it is?<eos> I'd think very hard if I were you.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Tell me who it is.<eos> Give me a name.<eos> It wants her, not you.

VALERIE:<eos> Grandma.<eos> Bread. Blanket.<eos> Do you need anything else?<eos> I do not want you to use that knife.<eos> -We have to find the wolf.<eos> -VALERIE:<eos> By sundown?<eos> Listen, the wolf wants you.<eos> But first it killed your sister.
[IN DEEP VOICE] The better to eat you with, my dear.<eos> [PANTING]<eos> Valerie. What are you doing out of bed?<eos> I was so worried.<eos> It looks much better.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To Grandmother's.<eos> I think she's in danger.<eos> We're going after the wolf before the storm can cover its tracks.<eos> It'll be human again and we can finally kill it.
Let's go.<eos> Okay. Bye.<eos> MITCH: Mitch and Dave.<eos> DAVE: Mitch and Dave, out on the town.<eos> Oh, dude, I didn't tell you!<eos> I booked a major movie role this week.<eos> I auditioned for a movie role, I got it.<eos> Yeah, first one.<eos> Hey, good for you.<eos> What is it called?
No, you don't.<eos> You're just trying to be nice.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I do, I envy it.<eos> No.<eos> I envy yours.<eos> BOTH: I Wish I had your life.<eos> It's rolling blackouts or something?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Look at your flow, it's so nice and thick.
I don't give a shit.<eos> We're gonna get our lives back.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Hey, where is the fountain?<eos> It is getting restored.<eos> What are you talking about, restored?<eos> Where did you take it?<eos> I don't know, guy, I just fill the hole.<eos> Hey, motherfucker... (EXCLAIMS)<eos> Whoa, whoa, who could tell us where it is?
I'm not Mitch.<eos> What?<eos> I'm Mitch.<eos> He's Mitch.<eos> Somehow we switched bodies.<eos> And I'm Dave.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> What happened was, we pissed in a magic fountain...<eos> Uh-huh. ...and the next day it disappeared.
Maybe we should talk about your bad memory at Dialogue Night.<eos> Stilton Coffee House tonight.<eos> Don't forget.<eos> Okay- okay?<eos> Bye.<eos> Hello.<eos> This is District Manager Carla Nelson from the Atlanta Department of Parks.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, we have found that fountain.<eos> It's been moved to 1100 Peachtree Boulevard.
Decision is yours.<eos> You can phone a friend, ask the audience, fifty-fifty.<eos> Do the math.<eos> One loses the job or three loses it.<eos> [SIGHS]<eos> Your call.<eos> I think I know who you're gonna fire.<eos> And tell him to leave his handicap parking pass when he leaves.<eos> You can't take that.<eos> It's issued by the state, Bobby.
Look, careful.<eos> Hey, are you gonna slap me in the face with your cock, Dale?<eos> Yes, I'll slap you in the face with my cock!<eos> - This guy's fucking crazy.<eos> - Slap you all over your face with my cock!<eos> - Don't get in a wreck.<eos> - It's go time.<eos> Okay.<eos> More, Dale.<eos> I will go up and down on you and I'll rub my naked butt against your naked butt until it's raw and red and we're both really chafed up real bad.
-Yes, Director.<eos> The boy's mother has been in London for a year already.<eos> She has no residence permit but a good job in a Chinese laundry.<eos> The address is:<eos> Whitechapel Road 248, at the back.<eos> -Remember? -I'll write it down.<eos> My son was going to follow her soon with Idrissa but... He was...<eos> He died.<eos> And what will you do?<eos> The jar returns to the well until it breaks.
I'll tell you that.<eos> Because your premiums are gonna skyrocket.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... my TV is not working again.<eos> I think I need a new one instead of this insurance.<eos> John?<eos> - Hello...<eos> - Hello?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you sure it's not unplugged again?
(HORSES WHINNYING)<eos> (CHATTERING)<eos> A fresh pot of tea.<eos> Thank you, George.<eos> GEORGE:<eos> Yes, Miss Adler.<eos> MAN:<eos> Fine choice, this place.<eos> Do you have the letter?<eos> It was taken.
The Trout is perhaps my favorite.<eos> (SPEAKS IN GERMAN)<eos> A fisherman grows weary of trying to catch an elusive fish.<eos> Out the way, out the way.<eos> So he muddies the water.<eos> I'm warning you.<eos> Confuses the fish.<eos> (GUNSHOTS)<eos> You were warned.<eos> It doesn't realize until too late that it has swum into a trap.
That sounds like something my mom would say.<eos> - They want us back for a debrief.<eos> - Take the kids back to OSS.<eos> - I'll meet you there. - Got it.<eos> Thanks for rescuing us.<eos> Any time.<eos> I used to get in trouble like this all the time.<eos> Hi, sweetheart. Sorry I missed you. Great news!<eos> I got the most amazing footage of a real spy battle at the watch shop!<eos> I'm gonna put it on the air tonight, primetime!
Why are you all gathering at this place?<eos> We're searching for the black ball.<eos> Black ball?<eos> If we have it, we can go where we want.<eos> You mean the room that contains the black sphere?<eos> You know it, huh.<eos> Where did you hear about it?<eos> I came here today to ask about that.<eos> Where is that room?<eos> It's not in this reality.
GANTZ moves by sucking his energy.<eos> That's why, if this bald-headed guy wakes up, it's also the end of GANTZ.<eos> If GANTZ dies, what will happen to us?<eos> That is...<eos> Right?<eos> Extermination... perhaps.<eos> We, who were revived by GANTZ will also disappear together with it.<eos> What the heck is that?<eos> Maybe GANTZ is rushing too.<eos> Before its lifetime ends, it wants to defeat all the aliens.
Why are you dressed like that?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Why are you dressed like that?<eos> Rose!<eos> Hey, Rose!<eos> Listen. I don't know what you have in mind here, but this is starting to freak me out, okay?<eos> I am not into this kind of shit, just ... if you could just let me go, I swear to ...<eos> Who the fuck is this?<eos> I don't know, I didn't get his name.<eos> It's Sam.
Repent.<eos> Why... A boundless mind is rewarded with unending fortunes<eos> Unending is life, linked by love<eos> Why do you look but not see<eos> The teachings of the rules<eos> Let's us understand spirit, senses, space willingly<eos> Master Uncle, the temple is no more.<eos> No,<eos> Shaolin Temple is always in us.<eos> It can never be destroyed.
Officer White, please.<eos> Sure.<eos> Hold on. White!<eos> You got a call on line one.<eos> This came for you, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Jonathan, I just got a weird call.<eos> What?<eos> It was really fucked up.
I mean, we tried and tried for years, and when nothing happened, eventually we went over to the clinic, and we got tested.<eos> And I never bothered to go and get the results.<eos> But she did.<eos> And when she told me everything was okay, I was...<eos> And then nine months later, we-<eos> She said that she was afraid she was going to lose me and that it was just an arrangement.<eos> - Who's the father?<eos> - She wanted the kids to look as much like me as possible.<eos> I got a younger brother, man.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, Gavin, but please don't make my day any worse than it already is.
This is absurd.<eos> What are we waiting for?<eos> What the fuck is this place?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You tell us.<eos> Alex got informed.<eos> No-one could possibly have imagined that anything would have happened.<eos> - Alex did not get informed.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> We just need to find out who the fuck it is out there.
- Well then...<eos> - Take care of yourself.<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - Pompon, over there.<eos> Ah, over there?<eos> I didn't see it.<eos> Pompon is leaving.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Everything will be fine.<eos> Get in. When the train leaves, it leaves, I'm telling you.
And where are we in terms of communication?<eos> That's exactly my point.<eos> If this planet is sustaining intelligent life... of comparable levels to our own...<eos> That's a very significant point.<eos> So far we have nothing.<eos> We have a jumble of radio signals, the strongest of which are military radars.<eos> But even those radio signals are not something we can parse out and understand.<eos> We Don't even know it really exists.<eos> It could be some cosmic mirror of sorts.<eos> You've written extensively about that... as the most likely explanation for why it's identical to our own planet.

Hello.<eos> This is, uh, Rhoda Williams.<eos> My brother gave me this number.<eos> Rhoda, yes.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Rhoda?<eos> Yes. Hi.<eos> It's Keith Harding.<eos> I got your letter.<eos> I was very moved by it.
Excuse me?<eos> You do realize how much rooms cost in Paris...<eos> We can't find a room for you just like that!<eos> There's a waiting list.<eos> What'll I do, then?<eos> I don't know anyone here.<eos> My suitcase was stolen.<eos> You must help me.<eos> Do you have a student card?<eos> I told you, it was in my case.
What's weighing on you, Katie-girl?<eos> Last time you stopped by unannounced was three years ago.<eos> Talking to you lifted my spirits, Ella Mae.<eos> The only thing that got me through some days.<eos> Well, I still have ears to hear.<eos> That envelop you give Mam the other day. May I ask how you come by it?<eos> You and your folks have a talk?<eos> Jah, they told me about the English woman.<eos> But they wouldn't tell me what the letter said.<eos> Plainly, it weren't meant for my eyes or yours.
I'm so happy you picked this dress, Veruca!<eos> - You look beautiful.<eos> - Doesn't she?<eos> You guys, I'm getting married!<eos> I'm getting married!<eos> Not without your veil, you're not.<eos> - Where is that bad boy?<eos> - Oh, I think I left it upstairs.
I just assumed after we got married she'd stop hooking, but...<eos> You need to put this wedding band on a true heart.<eos> This is a good moment.<eos> Yeah. Should we go make it last, for a while, somewhere?<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> To your dorm.<eos> Sometimes I think about throwing the ring into the ocean.<eos> I know how wrong it is.<eos> But I can't.<eos> It's my Precious.
That really bothered you that I went to lunch with that guy.<eos> What do you mean, you went to lunch with him?<eos> I told you I was going to lunch with him.<eos> I thought it was he asked you to lunch and you were gonna like scoff at it.<eos> But you did? You fell for his charms?<eos> I don't even understand what this is.<eos> It's the beard, man.<eos> It doesn't move!<eos> Well, yeah, in the wind, man.<eos> It's flapping around.
what the hell are you doing?<eos> Don't ...!<eos> The owner of the barn.<eos> Hans Egevang from Virum.<eos> Leased it to a PO box and hasn't been there himself in years.<eos> - I doubt he can lead us to anything.<eos> Fan literature.<eos> But he's worse than I thought.<eos> He says when they eat, drink and even breathe!<eos> He punishes them by putting the lid on and rewards them by taking it off thus slowly suffocating them.
That one murdered out ofjealousy.<eos> So did he.<eos> Double homicide.<eos> Mother and daughter.<eos> And this guy beat his girlfriend's two-year-old to death.<eos> Talk about bringing your work home.<eos> That's my stepfather.<eos> - Do you ever not work? - Sure.<eos> I sometimes relax during sex.<eos> It depends on how good it is.
You know what, as firefighters, everybody thinks that we fight fire, and we do.<eos> But over 70% of our calls are medical emergencies where we are responding to heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, rampant obesity.<eos> And so we see, up close and personal, basically the destruction that's being caused by the standard American diet.<eos> To me, the answer is just absolutely so simple, it's criminal.<eos> It's just people starting to take responsibility for their health and starting to eat more plant-based foods.<eos> It's that simple.<eos> After 13 weeks on a whole foods, plant-based diet, it was time to get my results from Dr. Lederman.<eos> When you started, your weight was 231, 231 pounds, now 211 pounds.<eos> Okay, that's good. - It's a 20-pound drop there. - Wow.<eos> Your blood pressure was 142 over 82 when you started. It's now 112 over 70. Wow.
- But? - L'm concerned you won't like her.<eos> - She's different.<eos> - Ln what way?<eos> In every way.<eos> Miss Salander is here.<eos> Lisbeth.<eos> Mr. Dirch Frode.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Something wrong with the report?<eos> No, it was quite thorough.
Would you mind if I made a copy of this?<eos> No.<eos> I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky.<eos> So call him.<eos> Next time, fill out the proper paperwork.<eos> Which one are you?<eos> Going down.<eos> How's your sex life?<eos> I didn't care much for your last report.<eos> It felt perfunctory, like your heart wasn't in it.
Christian, why did you come back?<eos> Have a guess?<eos> You don't realize who I am.<eos> I know you're lost, so am I.<eos> I was lost when we met.<eos> All I know is that I like you, that you're beautiful.<eos> About the rest, well I couldn't care less.<eos> You're so beautiful Mona.<eos> Is Mona your real name?<eos> No, it's Isabelle.
- What were you supposed to tell me?<eos> - I don't know. I don't know.<eos> I was supposed to say that you are the perfect combination of sexy and cute which is actually something that I used to say to my wife.<eos> But now it's become corrupted.<eos> And I have 18 layers of clothes on.<eos> I'm wearing a shirt and a tie and a sweater and a suede jacket that just seals in all the heat.<eos> Seals in all the juices.<eos> It's all sweat under here.<eos> This is just sweat from here down.<eos> This sweater, this is called slim cut, but it feels like a scuba suit.
I think this may refer to my wife's first pregnancy.<eos> I had to give up an opportunity to go to America because of it.<eos> The carriage in front perhaps alludes to an apprehension that our two daughters, and other children perhaps still to come, will impede my progress even more.<eos> As a father of six, I can vouch for that.<eos> Not to mention the inevitable financial difficulties.<eos> No. Fortunately, my wife is extremely wealthy.<eos> Yes.<eos> That is fortunate.<eos> This log...<eos> Yes? I think, perhaps, you should entertain the possibility that it represents the penis.
I want to leave everything, break away and disappear with you.<eos> Then comes the voice of the philistine.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Vienna, maybe.<eos> Please don't go there.<eos> I must go wherever I need to feel free.<eos> Don't...<eos> You know your paper... led to one of the most stimulating discussions we've ever had at the Psychoanalytic Society.<eos> Do you really think the sexual drive is a demonic and destructive force?<eos> Yes, at the same time as being a creative force, in the sense that it can produce, out of the destruction of two individualities, a new being.
I'll be seeing him at the editorial meeting in Munich in September and I shall be perfectly civil.<eos> To tell you the truth, what finished him for me was all that business about you.<eos> The lies, the ruthless behaviour.<eos> I was very shocked.<eos> I think he loved me.<eos> I'm afraid your idea of a mystical union with a blond Siegfried was inevitably doomed.<eos> Put not your trust in Aryans.<eos> We're Jews, my dear Miss Spielrein, and Jews we will always be.<eos> Now, the real reason I invited you here this evening was to ask if you'd be prepared to take on one or two of my patients?<eos> I was interested in what you said about monotheism -- that it arose historically out of some kind of patricidal impulse.
Not true?<eos> No.<eos> You mean it was most probably a myth?<eos> No.<eos> I mean there were two perfectly straightforward reasons for Akhnaton, or Amenhopis IV as I prefer to call him, to excise his father's name from the cartouches.<eos> First, this was something traditionally done by all new kings who didn't wish their father's name to continue to be public currency.<eos> In much the same way as your article in the Yearbook fails to mention my name?<eos> Your name is so well-known it hardly seemed necessary to mention it.<eos> Do go on.<eos> Secondly, Amenhopis only struck out the first half of his father's name, Amenhotep, because, like the first half of his own name, it was shared by Amon, one of the gods he was determined to eliminate.
The blood of Europe.<eos> What do you think it means?<eos> I've no idea.<eos> Unless it's about to happen.<eos> What are your plans?<eos> We've been thinking of going back to Russia.<eos> As long as you leave Vienna.<eos> I spoke to him last week.<eos> I can't believe there's nothing to be done. There's nothing to be done.<eos> The day he refused to discuss a dream with me on the grounds that it might risk his authority, I should have known.
Uh... this is Mike Weiss, my partner.<eos> I was working as a mechanical and structural engineer when Vicky got stuck.<eos> So, you guys met her?<eos> Uh... yeah, we did.<eos> It's a terrible shame.<eos> She's my best friend's kid.<eos> That really hit me.<eos> I spent about a year working on developing the concept.<eos> Sooner or later the National Institute of Health gave me a 50,000 dollar grant... to develop a prototype for reproduction.<eos> Anyone ever use it?
I have one last question.<eos> How come you're so...<eos> We work out a lot and don't eat meat.<eos> Stop!<eos> Wait!<eos> We know where to find the treasure of the gods!<eos> Not bad, captain Wickie.<eos> - And we can get it for you!<eos> What do you know about the treasure?<eos> - It's in the palace of the eternal ice.
Stopping evil men!<eos> We don't go.<eos> Forbidden for us is the palace of the gods.<eos> Luck good, Wickie.<eos> - We will make sure that Sven doesn't get the treasure.<eos> They opened the palace with the amulet.<eos> Boss, this is a dead end.<eos> - Do you see my treasure anywhere?<eos> No.<eos> Unless it is invisible.
Enough!<eos> Get off!<eos> You can't stop now.<eos> You gonna leave me hanging?<eos> Jerk!<eos> Why don't you do what you did to Felipe?<eos> Blow me till I'm done.<eos> You fucking nerd.<eos> Honey, did you decide on your school trip?<eos> It's this weekend.
- So these martinis are ...<eos> - Redundant, I think.<eos> I want to leave.<eos> One thing.<eos> Yes.<eos> Because none of this are actually going to happen ... Can I make an appointment with you?<eos> What kind of appointment?<eos> I'd like to make a date to kiss you.<eos> My schedule is fairly flexible.<eos> Is it flexible on 30 years?
It was okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> He is the kindest and gentlest person in the world.<eos> He seemed sweet.<eos> He seems to love you very much.<eos> He does.<eos> And I love him.<eos> Is that you came here to tell me?<eos> That you love your husband, and your anniversary was okay?<eos> Why was it okay?
- No, not now.<eos> You promised!<eos> You said we would go on the beach when it was warmer.<eos> Can I swim? - It's too cold.<eos> Maybe this summer.<eos> Do not run! You can fall.<eos> - I'm eight! I do not fall.<eos> Where is the lake?<eos> - Right over here.<eos> Is it here?
Congress is figuring out how to work online.<eos> When the word goes out there will be a run on the banks, gas stations, grocery stores, you name it.<eos> People will panic.<eos> The virus will be the least of our worries.<eos> It will tip over now.<eos> We just need to make sure that nobody knows until everybody knows.<eos> ALAN:<eos> My temperature's 101.<eos> Higher than it was earlier.<eos> My head hurts and my throat feels like it's closing.
Nobody from the ministry, no police.<eos> If we see anybody else, any other vehicles, you'll never see her again.<eos> Yes?<eos> Yes, I'm fine.<eos> Please give them what they ask.<eos> I just wanna go home.<eos> SUN FENG:<eos> Once we have the vaccine, we'll tell you where to find her.<eos> - Is it French or American?<eos> -We could not get enough from the French. It's been made here.
[ALL CHUCKLING]<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's light this baby up.<eos> Ready?<eos> MEN: on.<eos> WOMAN:<eos> Hey!<eos> - It worked!<eos> - Beautiful.<eos> Okay, so this evening we are gonna raise this ball to the very top of the pole where it will stay until 11:59.
GIRL:<eos> I haven't seen Piper's mom, but I know she's around here somewhere.<eos> - Who are you gonna kiss at midnight?<eos> - You, baby.<eos> I'm flattered, but I'm also spoken for.<eos> RYAN:<eos> We now go live to New Year's headquarters for an update on the situation.<eos> [CLEARS THROAT]<eos> Hello, I'm Claire Morgan of the Times Square Alliance and, as you all can see the ball has stopped halfway to its perch.<eos> It's suspended there to remind us before we pop the champagne and celebrate the new year to stop and reflect on the year that has gone by.
It's suspended there to remind us before we pop the champagne and celebrate the new year to stop and reflect on the year that has gone by.<eos> To remember both our triumphs and our missteps.<eos> Our promises made and broken.<eos> The times we opened ourselves up to great adventures or closed ourself down for fear of getting hurt.<eos> Because that's What New Year's is all about.<eos> Getting another chance.<eos> A chance to forgive.<eos> To do better, to do more, to give more, to love more.<eos> And to stop worrying about "what if" and start embracing what will be.<eos> So when that ball drops at midnight and it will drop let's remember to be nice to each other.
Nicholas! Come on!<eos> You must wake up.<eos> We're going swimming.<eos> It's delicious!<eos> Come on, Nicholas!<eos> Hello! It's the police, Nikolai!<eos> Yes, good afternoon.<eos> The police are out in the nice weather?<eos> Yes, do you have a vehicle registration certificate?<eos> It should be in order.
Like, a Kodiak, huh? You know, I saw that documentary that asshole did. You know, the fag who loves bears...<eos> Listen, listen, pal.<eos> I don't want to talk. I need some quiet.<eos> So, I'm just going to put my head back, okay?<eos> Yeah, it's cool.<eos> Sir. Sir, I need you to sit down, please.<eos> Yeah, I'm sitting.<eos> You like that shit, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I would never eat a sea urchin. They say if you eat it, not only does it make you impotent, but it poisons you, and it causes extreme skin reactions.
Put your fucking hands up.<eos> Let me show you how this is done.<eos> Put your fucking hands up.<eos> Fuck!<eos> You motherfucker!<eos> You cut this shit out.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Get up, get up, get up.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What did it want?
I do.<eos> I Wish I didn't.<eos> I really wish I could believe in that stuff.<eos> This is real, the cold.<eos> That's real. The air in my lungs.<eos> Those bastards out there in the dark stalking us.<eos> It's this world that I'm worried about, Talget, not the next.<eos> What about your faith?<eos> What about it?<eos> It's important.
-Would you like to experience it?<eos> -I think that not.<eos> -It has gone to hunt?<eos> -No.<eos> - And you?<eos> Only by rewards.<eos> We can go to a site, where can think a little.<eos> Who wants to fight?<eos> I hope that the row with Paul was not something serious.<eos> It is unstable and possessive.
For some reason this keeps him going.<eos> Hold this for a while.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Brave lad.<eos> Here we go.<eos> That has always followed.<eos> Cool.<eos> Why that light before his eyes?<eos> - Nothing 'his'.<eos> It is not human.
We're going to Elverum Police Station, for questioning.<eos> And I hope you cooperate, so that I can go back home to Oslo tomorrow.<eos> Attention all patrol cars.<eos> In other words, both of them.<eos> Bravo 3-0 here.<eos> Egmon Karisen has reported his truck stolen.<eos> Did Karisen sound sober?<eos> Over.<eos> Not exactly. Over.<eos> Call Bamse Pub. It's probably parked there. Over.
Go, go!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Look!<eos> Come on!<eos> Run!<eos> But where's Dave?<eos> Help me up!<eos> Oh, help you up?<eos> Is that what I'm supposed to do now, Dave?<eos> All I had was my treasure, and now it's gone.
It goes against my nature to destroy such information... but I don't trust it in the general files either.<eos> Could I trust it with you?<eos> If we were to create a confidential file?<eos> Of course, Edgar.<eos> Thank you, Miss Gandy.<eos> Information is power.<eos> It protected us from the communists in 1919... and since has been vigilantly collected, organized, and maintained by our FBI.<eos> Attorney General Kennedy's Office.<eos> Did you always have this fireplace or did you have it put in?<eos> It was put in.
We plant stories with them to ensure... that the activities of suspected radicals see the light of day.<eos> They'll trace it.<eos> Well, only if it's true.<eos> See, it's called counterintelligence, Clyde.<eos> The more untrue the story, the more dramatic the impact.<eos> Now, I'm going to send the hotel recording... along with a personal letter the day before he gets the Nobel Prize.<eos> And if he accepts the award, we'll send the tape straight to the press.<eos> Are you sure that you want to be involved with that kind of surveillance?<eos> Well, that's why the letter won't be from me.<eos> It'll be a fictitious letter from one of his own.
Yes, come with me.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Well, no, it's not okay.<eos> We've got her in intensive care.<eos> - I see.<eos> - She had quite a night last night.<eos> We almost lost her.<eos> She's a bit pale. She's been through a lot.<eos> She's in a state of shock from the blood loss.<eos> It wasn't fatal.
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.<eos> - I would love that. - Yeah.<eos> Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?<eos> Sure.<eos> I mean, it's not for me, obviously.<eos> It's for my niece, Kendra.<eos> She wants to be a writer someday.<eos> Right, of course.<eos> But you know, my name isn't actually on the books.<eos> I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside. But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
What if it can't be cleaned, Mitchell?<eos> !<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Then we'll pay for a new rug.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> This is a limited-edition alpaca hand-made stark rug!<eos> I saw it in Architectural Digest.<eos> It cost $50,000.<eos> It was in Diane Keaton's house.<eos> Oh, no, it was in, oh, what's-her-name's house.
Fine.<eos> Ask me if you can go golfing now.<eos> Other people.<eos> All I want is, when I go to bed at night, to be laying next to a man that is generous and giving.<eos> And that man doesn't necessarily need to be you.<eos> Okay, let's do this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Guillermo!<eos> Do you want me to move the waste basket closer to you?<eos> - Oh, no. It's fine where it is.
No, vacation!<eos> I know! A home gym!<eos> All right, Guillermo, your ambition is infectious.<eos> Clearly my wife needs to be inoculated.<eos> But I'm gonna be blunt.<eos> - Ay, no, no, you're not going to --<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> Now, you wanted my honest business advice, right?<eos> - Very much.<eos> - Here it is.
But I'm gonna need you to come with me.<eos> So, that the girl with the haunted kidney?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, just when you think you seen it all.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Can't exactly burn the thing.<eos> I mean, she kind of needs it.<eos> Well, she can't just walk around with it, Dean.<eos> The spirit's attached.<eos> It's gonna use her to get close to anyone it wants revenge on.

- illegal stuff in from Mexico.<eos> - That's it, Toto. Misha's celebrity Tweet says it's a black-market organ thing.<eos> I'm betting drugs.<eos> Anyway, as far as I can see, I think they've lost any shred of talent they ever had.<eos> Oh, that one hurt.<eos> Drugs.<eos> Maybe we did it wrong.<eos> No.<eos> No, that... that spell was perfect.<eos> It should have worked.

In the coat?<eos> Liar, that one, not who he says.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Uh, I'm not affiliated with his paper.<eos> I just have a couple of questions about a dinner party you were at in 1937.<eos> Everyone's so fascinated.<eos> Wanna know about my night at the home of the great H.P. Lovecraft?<eos> If you don't mind.<eos> Well, you know the story.<eos> They did their spell and they all said it failed.
So where is this emergency exit?<eos> - 800 feet above Broadway.<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> I had no control over where the door materialized.<eos> Anyone can access it.<eos> They have to believe that nothing they see is real.<eos> - Don't look and follow me.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> Computer runs a security scan every six minutes.<eos> It detects me, it releases an antivirus posse of men in black who are constantly circulating the city.
A very dangerous one, especially to anyone who finds it.<eos> - You need to handle it with caution.<eos> BOOSTER: I will. As soon as we make a deal.<eos> Well, I'm sure we can work out some kind of a reward, Mr. Gold.<eos> BOOSTER:<eos> I had something in mind.<eos> I know you and the mayor, you're like peanut butter and jelly.<eos> You pull some strings, get me the key to the city I'll help you find whatever you need me to find.<eos> You want the key to the city?<eos> Let's just say it's the last thing on my to-do list.
Smallville Real Estate.<eos> We may be small, but we sell big.<eos> - Now, you live here with...?<eos> - Soon-to-be...<eos> - Is he here?<eos> - No, he had an emergency in... - -the fields this morning.<eos> Big, something important.<eos> A fireplace.<eos> How charming.<eos> Is it original to the house?

We'll take as much time as you need.<eos> [COMPUTER BEEPING]<eos> Sorry for the digital disruption, but it's important.<eos> What is it, Tess?<eos> I just heard from one of my military contacts.<eos> Slade Wilson's back.<eos> He was found unconscious on a street corner.<eos> He's in a coma and completely unresponsive.<eos> There's one way out of the Phantom Zone.<eos> It has to be activated by a member of my family.
They're the most dangerous prisoners.<eos> We need to hurry.<eos> OLIVER:<eos> How's it look?<eos> Someone took the crystal.<eos> - But the gate's still open, right?<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> The crystal is the gate.<eos> Whoever sent Slade back must have taken it with them.<eos> It's our only ticket out of here, Clark.
I'm not avoiding you.<eos> I have work to do.<eos> The president just arrived for a fundraiser plus a huge stack of police reports just came in.<eos> And I have to call all the guests and let them know that the big day has been cancelled.<eos> Nice try, speedy.<eos> But you can't make 411 disappear.<eos> [WHOOSH]<eos> [SIGHS]<eos> Your Copperfield act is impressive but it won't change my mind.<eos> Go out there and save the day. Wherever it needs saving.
Unflattering graffito neutralized.<eos> Gadzooks! The one hazard this balloon cannot negotiate... a gentle breeze!<eos> Help!<eos> Curtail my ascent!<eos> Curtail it, I say!<eos> Hey, Mr. Burns needs our help!<eos> Let's just shoot at him and see what happens.<eos> Good thing I went hunting this morning.<eos> Bagged me an elk.<eos> Hey, where'd it go?
Tell me if she falls.<eos> Abraca-Milhouse!<eos> Hello, Harvey.<eos> I've probably had enough.<eos> Eh, a little more couldn't hurt.<eos> ♪ And the year's fourth peach is a moldy peach ♪<eos> ♪ Shame on the man that sells him ♪<eos> ♪ Now, the year's fifth peach is a fuzzy peach ♪<eos> ♪ Its kisses are quite ticklish ♪<eos> ♪ And the year's sixth peach is a briny peach ♪ ♪ It tastes so fine and picklish ♪
Geez, we had a safe full of gold in there and it didn't ride so low.<eos> My lick.<eos> My lick.<eos> My lick.<eos> Hey, you licked the back.<eos> That was my side. Aw, brother germs!<eos> Aw, sister spit!<eos> Bart, this is a truffle.<eos> You're a truffle. A truffle is a fungus that grows in tree roots.<eos> It's one of the most prized gourmet foods in the world.
I was the bus driver when those sweet young angels were swallowed up by the river.<eos> Now I'm gonna join them!<eos> Otto, they're just mannequins!<eos> Then... I'm not responsible for a horrible tragedy.<eos> And I didn't do anything wrong by fleeing the scene and not reporting it and killing that hobo with the big mouth.<eos> I might have imagined that last part.<eos> Skinner! When I say "Drive us to Bolivia," that is your cue to start the damn car!<eos> I can't find the key!<eos> Looking for something? Yes, my car key.<eos> Does it look like this?
I think.<eos> Rose...<eos> Edgar would have loved this.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> I'm not accusing, I'm, uh, offering.<eos> Congratulations are in order.<eos> I'm not so sure about that.<eos> There are still a lot of loose ends. We don't know where the missing canister is.<eos> It'll turn up.
Mr. Hanna, Santa Monica.<eos> And take your gravitationally challenged partner with you.<eos> Another day in paradise.<eos> Got to love that fresh ocean air.<eos> You mean the smell of fish?<eos> It's one of the reasons I moved away from here.<eos> We come from the ocean, G.<eos> It's Mother Nature's womb.<eos> It's true.<eos> It's the primordial soup of life.
I don't, um... think that'll be necessary.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.<eos> Have a wonderful day...<eos> Agent Frisbee.<eos> It's Freeze...<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Tell them.<eos> We were tasked to investigate a series of... low-level leaks here in Los Angeles.<eos> Our investigation has been focusing on a petty officer.<eos> We know he had a partner, but we didn't know who it was... until today.
What is your name?<eos> Hakeem Fayed.<eos> Walaikum assalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.<eos> Come.<eos> Join us.<eos> Talk.<eos> I don't join anything.<eos> Shukran.<eos> Got it.<eos> 25 minutes ago, our silver van turned into Saticoy Street in North Hollywood, and it's still there.
Surprisingly, yes.<eos> Nice.<eos> Now, what exactly are toes?<eos> Can you please get back to the drunk girl?<eos> I'd like something to think about in the shower.<eos> Oh, yeah, right.<eos> She takes off all of her clothes, climbs in the hot tub.<eos> - And the first thing I notice...<eos> - The water level rose. - No.<eos> - Well, of course it did.
Looks like we have competition.<eos> I don't know who it is.<eos> False alarm.<eos> The other firm sent a car and driver. Talk about tone-deaf.<eos> This community is gonna hate him.<eos> I just don't like the feeling we're being exploited, that's all.<eos> There are a lot of lawyers out there, looking to make a quick buck.<eos> But I know what it's like to be exploited.<eos> People see you as a victim and they wanna use that.<eos> They don't see pain unless it can be packaged and sold.
But you didn't.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> And you see, it's already coming between us and I really... I just don't want it to.<eos> It's not going to.<eos> Look, I know that I act all tough and I talk all tough, but really... It's just a front to protect yourself from your own vulnerability.<eos> What are you, my fucking therapist now?<eos> No, I'm a friend.<eos> Who knows that every time you curse, you blink.<eos> - Like your body's rejecting the word.<eos> - It does not.
Where are you?<eos> President Chambal's inauguration day.<eos> Yes, you're head of security.<eos> Everything's going perfectly.<eos> Today we climb the mountain!<eos> Agent English.<eos> The people have spoken, and the message is clear.<eos> A future of peace and prosperity!<eos> The backup electrical supply has been cut.<eos> No, it hasn't.

There are plenty of other jokes in the universe we can share.<eos> Let's just get ready for tonight.<eos> Some well deserved vacation.<eos> - I got a good one for you, Violet.<eos> - Lay it on me!<eos> Oh, dang!<eos> - What?<eos> - I think I forgot it.<eos> Well that's the good thing, Daze.<eos> I'll be here if it comes back to you
I wonder who she is.<eos> Okay, okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves.<eos> I mean, Ade, you're right.<eos> It doesn't sound like Navid.<eos> He's... He's not the type.<eos> He's loyal and faithful, and he wouldn't...<eos> Yeah, but I found another girl's earring in his bedroom.<eos> I know.<eos> But that's... That is just circumstantial evidence.<eos> It could be anyone's.

It's pretty dark.<eos> Might be hard to find this bird, seeing as we, unlike owls, cannot see in the dark.<eos> I know.<eos> Wait, that's it.<eos> That's their call.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, look...<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh my God, there it is.
You don't care if I talk to her, do you?<eos> Yes, I do, actually.<eos> I don't trust her.<eos> Annie, come on. Just....<eos> Just stay away from her, okay?<eos> You know what, you need to chill out.<eos> Uh, hey, Silver. Did you finish that report on low-flush toilets?<eos> Yes.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Here it is.
You know why you're August, don't you?<eos> Um, because more people drown in August than other months?<eos> 'Cause August is the hottest month of the year.<eos> And you're pretty hot.<eos> Oh, well, I mean, you're hot, too, so...<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Sorry to interrupt this meeting of the Algonquin Roundtable, but we have a bit of a technical glitch here.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure you can figure it out, Silver.<eos> No, no, I can't.<eos> Mr. July spilled his body oil all over your computer, and now it is totally fried. No!
Since when?<eos> Since I realised that it really helps me get back into the water, you know, after my accident.<eos> And then I met a guy and he smokes too, so...<eos> Well, not like how you're thinking of.<eos> He has to smoke for, like, medicine, you know, because he's sick or...<eos> He's dying, actually.<eos> I totally blew him off the other day, he...<eos> I don't know, I feel like I'm not, like, ready to deal with that, you know?<eos> Like, death, because it...<eos> It's so final.
Because maybe I'm not a sellout, you know.<eos> Maybe I don't need to sell my soul just to get a free trip to Bali.<eos> All right, my bad.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I had to tutor some freshmen.<eos> No worries.<eos> Hey, did anyone else get the apple pie?<eos> - It's pretty good.

Because she wrote about me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Some parts of this read like a diary.<eos> You're quite prominent.<eos> We should get to Massive Dynamic.<eos> Okay, well, call me if you find something.<eos> State your full name, please.<eos> Special agent Matthew Nicholas Goldin.<eos> Does the name "Michael Baird" mean anything to you?<eos> No, it does not.
He saved lives.<eos> How come all the creeps go after the good guys?<eos> Oh, my.<eos> How many times are you gonna test that?<eos> Or is is just a way for you to break your diet?<eos> Do you think I enjoy eating greasy fried food?<eos> You're right.<eos> But if I can figure out exactly what this substance is, then we may be able to determine where it comes from.<eos> Look.<eos> The molecules in the powder bond with calcium, but they also pear to be capsulized, which preserves the agent until it's delivered into the host.
Well, it is lovely weather we're having today.<eos> See?<eos> You do smalltalk just as good as anyone.<eos> Evenin', folks.<eos> What unit?<eos> Uh, Kimball, 7-C.<eos> - Enjoy.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Oh, is the elevator not working?<eos> No, it's workin'.
That's wrong.<eos> Concentrate, Olivia!<eos> No!<eos> I'm not working on this anymore!<eos> Minimal activity in the stable neocortex.<eos> Anger isn't the answer.<eos> Loneliness isn't the answer either.<eos> Perhaps fear...<eos> Show you a movie.<eos> It's one of my favorites.

Two eggs over easy, bacon and grapefruit juice.<eos> That's what I made you for breakfast on Sunday.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Look.<eos> There's a Stage Three Tear.<eos> We've initiated amber protocol.<eos> The security firm just e-mailed this video.<eos> We think they gained entrance from the side fire door.<eos> - How come they didn't trigger the alarm?<eos> - It was disabled.
Walter.<eos> Walter.<eos> I understand now. I understand what the Machine does.<eos> I know what it's capable of and I know where it came from.<eos> - The first people?<eos> - Yes, the first people, Walter. But the first people are us. You, more specifically.<eos> And maybe Ella and Astrid.<eos> I don't know who took the Machine back through time.<eos> But I know something else.<eos> I've seen doomsday. And it is worse than anything you could possibly imagine.
In this case, it doesn't have to.<eos> When the time is right, you drift upstairs to a private room.<eos> Spend the night or just a few hours.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> But, uh, what makes you think people will show up?<eos> It sounds like you need a big marketing push just to get the word out.<eos> No marketing.<eos> I say where and when, people show up.<eos> If I can prove to you the Bass brand has a quantifiable worth, will you look at my business plan?<eos> It shows how you can keep the company together under the Bass name, with my involvement.
I'm a self-actualized, mature-beyond-her-years-yet- still-youthful-and-dewy working woman.<eos> Bryn Harold will be impressed.<eos> Those aren't tulips.<eos> Why would I buy your mother and Eric tulips?<eos> I left you a message.<eos> I didn't get it.<eos> I took you off of gift duty and put you on purple sticky note.<eos> What purple sticky note?<eos> The one that I said I left on my computer screen.<eos> It was right here.
Uh, that's Dalgaard... Two A's after the "G."<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Angry cokeheads... my father cut me off.<eos> I have to pay them back somehow.<eos> Make sure you don't leave out any of those zeroes.<eos> Fine, but then that's the end of it.<eos> $100,000?<eos> Eric, what is the meaning of this?<eos> I hear a storm is threatening someone's very life today.<eos> Let's hope they find some shelter and it's not behind bars.
But why was he stupid enough to stay and get himself killed?<eos> Because of this rock he was trying to find.<eos> - What rock?<eos> - A moonstone.<eos> - I had no idea.<eos> - What?<eos> Moonstone.<eos> - Did he find it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where is it now?
"The wood from one tree and one tree alone, an ancient white oak would bring death to an Original vampire.<eos> When the tree burned, all hope was thought lost."<eos> [ELENA SCOFFS]<eos> He was trying to figure out how to kill an Original.<eos> "But the ash from the tree was saved and witches forged a dagger to which the ash could be bonded.<eos> This alchemic bond provides the necessary poison..."<eos> Elena.<eos> I wonder if this is true.<eos> I mean, do you think this dagger actually exists?<eos> I know it does.
You killed him.<eos> - He's dead and I have no one.<eos> - Aah!<eos> No. And now you're about to find out exactly what that feels like.<eos> [STEFAN GROANING]<eos> There you go.<eos> [GROANING]<eos> What the hell?<eos> That's for not telling me the dagger would kill me.<eos> Next time it goes in your heart.
- That'd be me. Not me.<eos> I've witch stuff to attend to with Bonnie.<eos> Does that mean that you're taking her to the...?<eos> Don't get quiet on my account.<eos> If you have a plan to combat the impending vampire doom please do tell.<eos> Seriously. What is the plan to get us out of this mess, hmm?<eos> I delivered you a moonstone a werewolf, and a dagger to lure and kill Klaus. And right now, all you have is a moonstone.<eos> - Or so you tell me.<eos> - No, we have it.<eos> - Where is it?
[GROANS]<eos> Who is this guy, Safari Sam?<eos> Okay, bad or badder?<eos> - The dark colors suit you better.<eos> - Oh, thank you, honey.<eos> Okay, pop quiz.<eos> The dagger and white ash are in the Salvatore's possession?<eos> The dagger was used to kill Elijah.<eos> You'll find him in the basement of the house.<eos> Okay, that dagger needs to stay exactly where it is.
Chad, Mr. Saltzman, from third period.<eos> Chad, of course.<eos> How would you and your friends like, uh, to earn a little extra credit?<eos> JEREMY:<eos> Wait.<eos> Look, I, um, want you to have this.<eos> If you're asking me to go steady, that was the '50s.<eos> No, I'm serious, Bonnie.<eos> - The ring won't work on me.<eos> - But it was made by a witch.
Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> So Klaus drew the Aztec sketches about the curse?<eos> Roman scrolls, African tribal etchings and any other culture or continent we felt like planting it in.<eos> But why?<eos> The easiest way to discover the existence of a doppelganger or to get your hands on some long-Iost moonstone is to have every single member of two warring species on the lookout for it.<eos> So it's not Aztec at all?<eos> The Curse of the Sun and the Moon is fake.<eos> It doesn't exist.
I thought of you.<eos> As a friend.<eos> We keep Mario Peter and Jimmy.<eos> * Others, not worth it.<eos> Let's go for a walk with this nice weather?<eos> - I have a shooting place Dauphine. An ad for Vogue Homme.<eos> Skip, but I'm busy.<eos> - I love this place.<eos> Andre Breton said it was the sex of Paris.<eos> - Oh yeah? Because it is a triangle with bushes in the middle of the Seine?
- Why do you say that?<eos> You would say it to him?<eos> At the other there.<eos> - I would say not.<eos> - Why do you tell me?<eos> - I do not know I try to reassure you.<eos> - Reassure me?<eos> I have a micro penis?<eos> - No, not at all.<eos> - It is not big, but not micro.

Of course we can imagine it. It's always the same.<eos> Yeah, but he's gonna say "cool" at least five times.<eos> It's really great of Jeff to put this together.<eos> I'm not jealous.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> Oh, cool, someone got him a briefcase, like in the movie.<eos> What's in it?<eos> Hey, don't touch that!<eos> It's from Jeff, and he says nobody but Abed can open it.
I have studied this show, mister Abed.<eos> I am not a fan, I am not a groupie, I am an academic.<eos> When I ask the question, "Who's the boss?"<eos> It is a rhetorical question.<eos> When I ask the question beyond the question, "What is a boss?"<eos> I really think it's Angela, because if it's a boss...<eos> Enough!<eos> I would like you to leave my room.<eos> My mind is open, Professor.<eos> It's as open as the door to Mona's bedroom.
The time has come, my friend.<eos> We have to talk about our arrangement.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no.<eos> Oh, no, no, no!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Unpaw him, you big ape!<eos> I saw this in a Tarzan movie!<eos> It was called... Tarzan Versus the Yetis.
We'll have to take shifts.<eos> Hermes, you take the first six hours.<eos> Very well.<eos> Louder, louder!<eos> Right, baby.<eos> Look, I just have a common cold!<eos> It'll be gone as fast as I can sneeze, hurl, and squirt it out.<eos> No, it won't.<eos> The common cold died out 500 years ago, and subsequently, humanity lost all resistance to its ravages, but the virus survived in you, frozen for a thousand years.<eos> Huh, so it was hiding deep down inside of me, like my skeleton bones?
Shall I switch it off?<eos> Negative.<eos> Rosemary, release the surgeon general.<eos> Get in there! Ow!<eos> It's bright out here.<eos> Wernstrom, the quarantine has failed.<eos> Give me a worst case scenario.<eos> And make it grim.<eos> I've prepared some projections.<eos> Should the virus escape Manhattan, this is how far it will spread in 12 hours.
What if it's not better up there?<eos> What if there's nothing there?<eos> At least we will have tried it.<eos> Come on!<eos> There you go.<eos> I've seen a bird.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Quite a big one.<eos> - It flew in the same direction we're heading.
New York.<eos> It's evening.<eos> It's raining, pouring down outside the UN.<eos> I come in through the entrance, run to the elevator.<eos> Are you with me?<eos> You're there, in a suit skirt.<eos> You gaze hungrily at me.<eos> I feel my dick growing, a huge tower building up.<eos> You look at my dick.<eos> It's even bigger now.
We're entering Sarah's code.<eos> Listen, now, once you open that door, your body's is gonna raise the temperature in that room fast, which means you'll only have ten seconds to get it back down.<eos> Seven... Six...<eos> And that, my friends, is how it's done.<eos> Are you sure the lasers are there?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> All right, Chance, you're up.<eos> Got to get to that computer.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> The table isn't where it was in Winston's plan.
That lunatic that everybody at the bureau - is afraid of? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, rest easy, pal.<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> You've always been there for me.<eos> Time for me to return the favor.<eos> - Teamwork.<eos> - Oh, yeah, I'll hold.<eos> Transfer me to the supervisor.<eos> Oh, what was that guy's name?<eos> It begins with a "C" or a "T."
Our horoscopes could not have changed over night!<eos> Our stars are still jealous of us.<eos> I am sorry. I am not questioning your beliefs.<eos> But what could be worse than this?<eos> It's better to die than live like this.<eos> But father?<eos> I once failed with him and you.<eos> I can't fail again.<eos> Do you remember this damn?<eos> I think it is also like us.
You've put all his medicines?<eos> - Yes. -Show.<eos> Grandpa, I'm a healthy boy now.<eos> You're a strong boy.<eos> Now, don't need this.<eos> So, we'll remove it.<eos> Throw it.<eos> "Salutations, O motherland!" This urban dam has completed 100 years of existence.<eos> This is the last sunset for this colonial dam.<eos> It'd witnessed an empire on which the sun never used to set.

The altitude of this place is around 3000 feet.<eos> If it breaks, the water will rush like a bullet and sweep the city in her loods.<eos> Let me talk to the mayor.<eos> Please try.to understand the situation, sir.<eos> The dam is not even tested once.<eos> - What?<eos> You're scared of a little hole.<eos> Go and check out the old dam, it has a lot of them.<eos> And it has lasted more than 100 years.<eos> But this is a concrete dam, it won't sustain.

You better.<eos> You know why?<eos> 'Cause this gangsta needs to get paid!<eos> OK, now...<eos> I need to ask you a favour.<eos> OK, Charlie, what can I do for you?<eos> Where's your cock?<eos> - And there's my answer.<eos> - Oh, I see it.<eos> It's right under your clit.
Well, normally I'd be against such a thing.<eos> A man is at his best when he's at his hairiest.<eos> That's what my mom always used to say.<eos> But in your case, I'd say shave that shit.<eos> Send it off to the poor kids in China or something.<eos> Jesus, I can't look away.<eos> It's like... a forest has grown up all around one magic mushroom.<eos> It's like a button on a fur coat.<eos> Well, look on the bright side, Charlie.<eos> It may be short, but it's thin.
It was kismet.<eos> - You just run into a lot of things. - Yes, I do.<eos> That much is true.<eos> But enough about me.<eos> I'd like to learn about you, Counsellor.<eos> OK.<eos> You'll get a kick out of this.<eos> I wrote a novel once.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> What was it about?
Darling, I can't follow you all the way home to daddy.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm like... your dad.<eos> So how was your flight?<eos> Charlotte Isabel?<eos> And what do you have in this huge suitcase?<eos> Bloodthirsty crocodiles?<eos> My presents.<eos> Right. Your birthday's coming up.<eos> Is it Thursday or Friday?
-One.<eos> -Mom?<eos> Leaving her to go get drunk the day she arrived...<eos> -Well... -How could you?<eos> Isn't a carnival a good idea?<eos> Bakhtin...<eos> You think I could have done such a thing to you?<eos> Right, but it was thanks to Bakhtin that I cooked it up.<eos> He demonstrated how the carnival is liberating.<eos> It exults the low and dethrones the high.
Sit down, Felix Are you tired?<eos> Do you want a hot chocolate chocolate?<eos> Thank happy..<eos> Nice that it worked.<eos> What?<eos> How was the exam?<eos> I told him about you.<eos> Yes, seen He makes his physician.<eos> (Use) What do you prefer a cocoa and coffee?<eos> It is here at a meeting the university hospital.
I'm concerned, Paul seufıt Paul..<eos> A harvester.<eos> Where are we going to take the money?<eos> I will not let me show It is not normal.<eos> Do something.<eos> Behavior has certain reasons can be examined through tests..<eos> In Berlin, a doctor...<eos> Berlin?<eos> A healer knows his stuff.<eos> It is the only one who can help us .
Felix.<eos> Do you no five It knocks.<eos> (Woman) Oh, sorry.<eos> I must go to the doctor shortly.<eos> Honey, what are you doing here?<eos> My father, Prof. Leyendecker today for lunch with her.<eos> We are also invited Prof. .<eos> Leyendecker is interested.<eos> You have the best specialists from Berlin.<eos> It has existed as the best.
is that what they look like?<eos> Come on, Lily.<eos> You've seen an artichoke before.<eos> - You haven't?<eos> - They look so weird.<eos> I'm not convinced that having a suicide-prevention center prevents any suicides.<eos> Well, the coffee's good.<eos> If someone were determined to destroy themselves...<eos> - ... I don't think they'd stop for coffee.<eos> - lt depends on what it tastes like.
- Does this tailspin involve a man?<eos> - Yes, it does.<eos> But I'm not as crazy as I was up till yesterday.<eos> Apparently that's due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche.<eos> Its importance is, I believe, almost incalculable.<eos> At the motel, I happened to use this soap. It was provided to me as a courtesy as one of the guests.<eos> That an economical motel would provide such good soap is quite unusual.<eos> - The scent is very precise.<eos> - Really?<eos> Tell me if it provokes any particular reaction in your psyche.
Fatality rate. lt's uncertain what percentage were intentional and how many were just due to unawareness of gravity's laws.<eos> I can just see those guys getting the gold packages, opening them and finding the good-smelling soap inside.<eos> The cute packaging should prove irresistible.<eos> And once clean, they'll start to see the world with new eyes.<eos> The change could be dramatic.<eos> Doar Dorm could soon become Dior Dorm.<eos> I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.<eos> I love the idea.<eos> Dior Dorm.<eos> I adore optimism, even when it's completely absurd.
But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?<eos> This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.<eos> Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea.<eos> They have no ships, Robert.<eos> There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.<eos> If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, - the scum will join him.<eos> - He will not cross.<eos> And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.<eos> There's a war coming, Ned.<eos> I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.
It's settled. I'm sure Morisset will like Teller.<eos> Are you sure your dog is not a bitch?<eos> No, it's a dog, a bastard.<eos> Telemachus, don't stay here.<eos> Unbelievable...<eos> - Hello sweetie, how are you?<eos> - Hello, Dad.<eos> David!<eos> This capon is not cooked.<eos> It's true, it's pink.
See you later, Mr Pelame.<eos> This guy is a little fucker!<eos> Who is that Brice?<eos> He works at the law office, right David?<eos> Did you know it?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> What's this jerk's last name? Teller.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Are you stupid?<eos> - What? It's not that?
That's wicked. You look like an orthodox priest.<eos> Or a Cossack!<eos> Come on!<eos> He's crazy.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I expect the worst.<eos> No, this one's good. Look.<eos> My grandfather.<eos> Teally?<eos> Philippe, this mustache of yours, it really turns me on.
Oh, red rose corsage, not a frigging carnation.<eos> Mandi, you are so winning Homecoming Queen.<eos> Totally winning.<eos> The school nurse will be heading up the blood drive,<eos> - so sign up for that now. - Please.<eos> Like I'm letting that petri dish of a clinic stick a needle in me.<eos> I know!<eos> And no matter what I said...<eos> Hey, uh... do you know where I could catch the bus?<eos> I think it just left.
- Maybe I will.<eos> Hey, you guys.<eos> Maybe I can treat you together. That's twice as good.<eos> Turn me on.<eos> And for half the price?<eos> - For you guys.<eos> He can take you under his wing.<eos> - Previously his forehead.<eos> We need to rid of that job and get you a sugar daddy soon.<eos> So really it is not. - Is that so?
I fucking hate his guts.<eos> Can you watch the kids for me, please?<eos> Don't try and call me, Mum.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Bye.<eos> So where's this computer at?<eos> Just north of Clare.<eos> And he only wants two hundred for it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is it any good?
Ugh! It's so bright.<eos> Oh... God, I'm...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I've, um...<eos> I'm... I'm just a little bit lost.<eos> I've had just a bit too much... wine.<eos> I'm so embarrassed.<eos> I just...<eos> I-I broke my heel, and my... my ankle, it just... kind of really hurts right now.
Devon! My water just broke.<eos> But you're not due yet.What is Baby Clara thinking?<eos> Well,it happened about ten minutes ago.<eos> I took a shower, and had a protein bar, and now I'm ready to go,so... Let's go have a baby.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm prepared for this.<eos> Yes,you are.You have a plan.You have an awesome plan.<eos> Okay,everything's gonna be just fine.<eos> Where's my push mix?<eos> I just got it from Chuck.It couldn't have disappeared.
Boy, I'll tell you, part of me thinks this is really self-destructive behavior, but most of me just thinks it's really hot.<eos> Spence, don't tease, okay?<eos> It's not funny.<eos> It's the opposite of funny.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just...<eos> I don't know how I'm supposed to react to all of this.<eos> Yeah, neither do I.<eos> Show me the stupid tree, okay?<eos> Yeah, it's right over here.
I don't know how I'm supposed to react to all of this.<eos> Yeah, neither do I.<eos> Show me the stupid tree, okay?<eos> Yeah, it's right over here.<eos> You are not gonna tell me...<eos> No, this was it.<eos> It was right here.<eos> Wait, are you sure that you have the right spot?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> It's gone.
I have no idea.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where's Ian?<eos> Don't worry, he went to Philly to be with Melissa.<eos> I didn't realize life existed at this hour.<eos> Come on, guys, just walk.<eos> You need to see this.<eos> I always hoped my first sunrise would have tequila in it.<eos> I'll make coffee.<eos> Well, when it's ready just pour it down my throat.
She called from the hospital.<eos> Mrs. Potter had a heart attack.<eos> Is she going to be okay?<eos> They couldn't revive her.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> I mean, she wasn't young, but still...<eos> Thank you for telling me, Denise.<eos> I know, baby.<eos> That smell never went away.<eos> It came with the car.

Well, every time I think I know something, I get the rug pulled out from under me, and I end up on my ass.<eos> C'est dommage.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what I said about you. And what I thought.<eos> The sweater with Alison's blood...<eos> You said that you gave it to her that night.<eos> I did.<eos> And then she got into a car...<eos> With some guy.<eos> I couldn't see who it was.
I'm sorry, really.<eos> But without proof of residency--<eos> I can take you down to my shop.<eos> You're welcome to wait there, file a police report.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I cannot believe this day.<eos> It's just... the law.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My identification.<eos> I- - It's gone.
Can you grab it for me?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Surprise.<eos> It's from me and your dad.<eos> It's pretty slick, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks, Mom. it's... it's great.<eos> I really did a lot of research and, I don't know, this car just really stood out to me.<eos> It's got a ton of great features, power everything, solid engine.
- Sure.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Surprise.<eos> It's from me and your dad.<eos> It's pretty slick, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks, Mom. it's... it's great.<eos> I really did a lot of research and, I don't know, this car just really stood out to me.<eos> It's got a ton of great features, power everything, solid engine.<eos> It's really roomy so you can, you know, carpool with all your friends. And, of course, it is safe because I'm still your mother.

Look at me.<eos> Hey, listen, Walt, I really appreciate you doing this again, you know?<eos> I know you guys must have your hands full with the car wash and all.<eos> No. No. No worries.<eos> Happy to do it.<eos> Besides, it gives me a chance to see how you work a case.<eos> - It's interesting.<eos> - Yeah. Like watching weeds grow, huh?<eos> Nah, this job's as boring as hell.<eos> Until it's not.
Uh, Puerto Rico is technically a territory. Huh.<eos> You know, maybe they were thinking...<eos> Some day.<eos> Uh, so no basement.<eos> No basement.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's a problem.<eos> My brother's in the peace corps, and won't be back for 18 months, and I said I'd hang on to his furniture.<eos> Well, if you're looking for storage space, there's an attic area that's sizeable.<eos> Oh. Huh. Well, an attic might be even better, as long as it's dry.
The water was about 40 degrees.<eos> He was basically refrigerated.<eos> But if I had to approximate, I'd say this man was killed shortly after our lieutenant was shot on the dinner boat.<eos> Cause of death?<eos> The bullet that I took from his brain is a good candidate.<eos> That looks like a .22.<eos> Bullet, back of the head, close range. Execution.<eos> After he was shot, the killer wrapped his body in a plastic tarp and then weighed it down with barbell plates.<eos> Yeah, well, the wrapping was nicely done, but the bow slipped.<eos> Body popped up, drifted downstream before it was fished out.
Donald... sometimes I can't remember who I was.<eos> Then let me show you.<eos> All right, who's got something?<eos> Paul got home before Petty Officer Craig was killed.<eos> Prove it.<eos> One large deep-dish with extra pepperoni and sausage.<eos> He ordered a pizza?<eos> Delivery kid remembers him;<eos> the receipt has a time stamp to prove it.<eos> Paul Simmons enlistment contract, did it say anything out of the ordinary?
When we survive the day,<eos> I will put a stop to it.<eos> But you have done good.<eos> You made me.<eos> And when we survive the day,<eos> I am going to eat that fuckin' witch, starting' with her face.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It must be past noon by now.<eos> The spell hasn't come.<eos> It may not come at all.
Goddamn it.<eos> He's a nurse.<eos> He's just a nurse.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Just you and me now, you.<eos> Lafayette?<eos> Who you with, you?<eos> Monsieur Virgil?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Is it Mavis?
- I have something for you.<eos> From David.<eos> This is Nikolev Tutorov.<eos> The fox chasing the chicken.<eos> - Russian is not my strong point.<eos> - The fox is singing to a chicken.<eos> About love.<eos> In the end, the chicken falls in love with the fox. And lets it in.<eos> It's a beautiful song ... because the fox is in love with the chicken, too.<eos> But it kills it anyway. You see?
man: It's the best day ever.<eos> woman: You might be wondering why I'm up at this ungodly hour.<eos> Like others, I believe that the time between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M. is one where the veil between this world and the next is the thinnest.<eos> Often during this time of the day, I hear the sound of my name uttered by an unseen presence.<eos> woman:<eos> Whoa. [laughs] [speaking native language] That's nice.<eos> man: And here we go into the garage.<eos> That's right. We're going to ride in the elevator.<eos> All right. Let's ride it.<eos> Here it is.
I love my life.<eos> But what do I love the most?<eos> I love my Lord, my heavenly Father, my Creator, from whom all blessings flow.<eos> man: I love doing about 150 miles an hour down a motorway in a good car. man #2: [giggles] man:<eos> I love football.<eos> I think football is the only sport that bring people together.<eos> woman speaking native language: I love... cleaning something that's really dirty so you can see the result.<eos> man: I actually love my refrigerator.<eos> It's such a cool thing.<eos> It remains at one corner.
I want a pet. Too. I want a pet.<eos> I want a pet. I want this pet. Yeah.<eos> Oh, babe, i'm so excited. Yeah. Oh, babe, i'm so excited.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, babe, i'm so excited. Yeah. I'm so glad that we agree.<eos> Yeah. I'm so glad that we agree. Yeah.<eos> I'm so glad that we agree. Yeah.<eos> You didn't take out the garbage.<eos> What?<eos> Garbage. What? It's overflowing.
What do you mean?<eos> Why I wasn't wearing any clothes when I came in.<eos> I'd rather you tell me why you're always so grouchy.<eos> I'm sorry, dear.<eos> I know.<eos> What now?<eos> You think the boat is ruined?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We'll have to see.<eos> I'm sure the engine will start when it's dried out.
Nikki killed herself.<eos> And you thought it would be all right to just cover up her suicide?<eos> To protect her memory, her dignity.<eos> You've seen the press out there.<eos> You think they care about my sister?<eos> We wanted to keep this private.<eos> Now, thanks to you, this is how she'll be remembered, forever.<eos> This is Dr. Megan Hunt, performing the autopsy of Nikki Parkson.<eos> There is a linear mark, 2.5 centimeters in width, situated horizontally on the upper neck.<eos> It extends obliquely upward and backward.
Didn't think it was secure enough.<eos> ROBOT:<eos> Good afternoon, Superman.<eos> May we be of assistance?<eos> Please bring Miss Lane's car inside and repair any damage from the flight.<eos> That key can't be safe.<eos> Why don't you give it a try?<eos> [LOIS GROANS]<eos> I carved it out of a piece of dwarf star material.<eos> It weighs half a million tons.
I couldn't ask for greater loyalty.<eos> Solaris is a living solar computer.<eos> He poisons healthy stars, making them emit blue light that he can metabolize.<eos> Set your receivers to 430 terahertz, and you'll be able to hear him.<eos> SOLARIS:<eos> Impossible, I made your sun red.<eos> You should have no powers.<eos> I see now.<eos> Your covering protects you from red sunlight.<eos> But it cannot long survive this heat.

- No, no, is ok.<eos> You can afford it dirja.<eos> Du hast 'nen good run at the moment.<eos> And?<eos> If you take the offer?<eos> Who else should a good script make your novel?<eos> - You know my story?<eos> - Hm-hm.<eos> But you read nothing else, what is not yours.<eos> After all, it's based on my idea.
I just want to know.<eos> Why did you shoot me?<eos> Because I wanted you to die.<eos> (SCOFFS) Too vague?<eos> Okay, I'm gonna try to be more specific.<eos> All my life I hated you.<eos> That is not true.<eos> It is true.<eos> That hate was always a part of me.<eos> But it started getting bigger.
One of these relationships isn't going to make it.<eos> And it has to be ours.<eos> Well, here's the only problem with that,<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Good.<eos> Then you know why I won't leave.<eos> Here's what I know.<eos> From the first day we met, I have been pretending that our age difference doesn't mean anything.<eos> Because it doesn't.
No, they push her!<eos> That girl's so good at the violin, she's practically Asian.<eos> So that's what this is about.<eos> You're competing with Bob and Lee.<eos> (SCOFFS) That's ridiculous.<eos> This is about Juanita.<eos> Building her self-esteem and giving her a chance to shine.<eos> And if a couple of same-sex parents end up crying at home in their silk kimonos, so be it.<eos> Oh, Mike, look at this place.<eos> Isn't it as beautiful as you remember it?
No offense, but I don't think you're gonna get through to him.<eos> Don't be so sure.<eos> I once smuggled vodka into church in a "Jesus saves" sports bottle.<eos> I can be pretty resourceful.<eos> Tables and chairs go out back, chafing dishes and flatware in the kitchen, and eyes off the boobs, but thanks for noticing.<eos> Hey.<eos> I saw the party rental truck.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's for our party tomorrow night.
Thanks for watching him.<eos> Hey. Can you watch him again on Wednesday?<eos> Mike and I are...<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Your big night, huh?<eos> Mike told you?<eos> Didn't have to.<eos> I caught him staring at my cleavage.<eos> So, post-transplant sex, huh?<eos> If it's as good as my post-cancer sex, you're in for a treat.
Don't ask me to do this.<eos> Please, Karen! Paul got away with Martha's murder, but he won't get away with mine.<eos> Toby.<eos> Here, kitty, kitty.<eos> Ikebana is all about bringing together nature and humanity.<eos> The three main branches, or shushi, represent chi, earth, ten, heaven, and jin, man.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Nothing to represent "woman."<eos> How about this insignificant clump of moss?<eos> We could stuff it down at the bottom, where it will only speak when spoken to.
It's your engagement ring--<eos> The crappy one I gave you a million years ago.<eos> You changed the diamond.<eos> I told you I'd give you a decent ring someday.<eos> There it is.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I appreciate this.<eos> I really do.<eos> But...<eos> I loved the ring the way it was.
So what are you saying?<eos> You're done trying to work things out.<eos> We've been trying.<eos> We can't give up.<eos> We have to keep fighting for this-- Fighting to save our family.<eos> Are we fighting to save it, or are we just fighting?<eos> It happens.<eos> That just ha--<eos> Lynette.<eos> Leave the suitcase where it is.
And I'll see you in a bit?<eos> You wanna set out the forks?<eos> Forks?<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> The recipe called for mandarin oranges.<eos> You told me to get mandarin oranges.<eos> Yesterday, and I went and got them myself.<eos> Well, I didn't know that, so I guess we have extra now.<eos> But... I didn't see your suitcase.<eos> It's in the closet.

Yeah, maybe a great quarterback. Like, I don't know, Manning?<eos> Get off me! - Girls!<eos> People can hear us!<eos> I told you we couldn't trust her!<eos> - I can't see!<eos> - Lynette!<eos> Stop it!<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Well, I lost my earring, and the girls here were kind enough to help me look for it.<eos> Oh, there it is!
"On Auda, son of Amar!"<eos> Approach.<eos> Now say three times:<eos> "Me, Leyla, " Nesib daughter, "I divorce Auda, son of Amar."<eos> Say it.<eos> I refuse. You refuse?<eos> If Auda followed his father, is that he had no choice.<eos> This is the man most peaceful imaginable.<eos> Pacific? Yes.<eos> It is just like his father.
No way.<eos> I can't believe it!<eos> Can't believe what?<eos> What is it?<eos> You've got to be joking.<eos> It's the probe.<eos> You know, the one they sent through when they first discovered the time fracture.<eos> How can you not know that?<eos> I was having a life, Maddy.<eos> No one knew at first how far back the fracture went or even where it led to.
Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I promise.<eos> No, no, no, no. Damn it!<eos> Wh-wh-what's wrong?<eos> It's stripped. The power cells are gone.<eos> The transport's dead.<eos> Okay, well, then we have to call somebody.<eos> We have to tell them that we're out here.<eos> Did you hear what he said?<eos> It's dead.
Clearly, the tiny town of Carthage is buzzing with opinions over the murder.<eos> He didn't shoot Mrs. Nugent in the back.<eos> He didn't do it.<eos> Bernhardt Tiede ain't no monster.<eos> Ain't no jury gonna convict Bernie of first degree murder.<eos> In fact, I don't know if a jury's gonna convict him of anything and I'll say this, if a jury as to convict him, they'll probably gonna give him probation.<eos> I n the meantime, Bernie sits in the county jail where he's reportedly already become a popular inmate leading a Bible study group and cooking meals for the staff.<eos> Now, we are going to line the bottom of the pie dish with cheese to provide a barrier between the liquid and the crust.<eos> Now a lot of people use grated cheese, but I found that if you cut it in little quarter inch cubes, it does a better job of keeping the crust from getting soggy.<eos> Now, we are going to sauté the broccoli lightly in olive oil till it's just bright green.

What does karma mean?<eos> Karma means doing something, saying something, or thinking something which puts an image in your mind.<eos> Something happens under the influence of kindness, under the influence of your teacher's blessing.<eos> Why are we talking about pot?<eos> Why are we talking about clock?<eos> Why are we talking about pen?<eos> Because the world is not coming from the outside.<eos> The world is coming from the images you plant in your mind, and you can plant whatever world you want, you see?<eos> You can plant whatever world you want.<eos> You don't need a body to die in, 'cause it doesn't exist down here.
But all of my kin were killed!<eos> Not all of them.<eos> He lives in the Outer Rim, in exile.<eos> You will find him.<eos> He will teach you everything you need to learn to become even more powerful.<eos> My brother.<eos> How?<eos> How will I find him?<eos> This talisman has been imbued with the power of our clan.<eos> It will be your compass.
There's, like, the occasional burglary, a bike stolen here or there, but as far as crime goes, pretty much zilch.<eos> Certainly no abducted minors.<eos> We're also looking into another case that we think is connected.<eos> East Cleveland, 92nd precinct, a girl named Aisha Rawlins.<eos> Okay, I'm pulling that up now.<eos> There's a whole different crime story there.<eos> Anything else involving a missing girl?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Four months earlier about a mile and a half from Aisha Rawlins' address, African-American, Wanda Barloff, nine years old, one day, she's just gone.<eos> Field office out there advised on the case, but it's still open.
But most of you voted against.<eos> We have assembled the barest of majorities. But then, this Borgia pope was elected with just such a majority.<eos> - The cardinal's demise was... sudden.<eos> - So it seems.<eos> - But his palace is ideal as a place of penitence and self-reflection.<eos> If it can be proven, what many of us suspect- corruption, simony, the blatant sale of the sacred offices, and worse, the utter degradation of the office of the papacy in the eyes of the Christian world...<eos> You must think of your sojourn here as a retreat.<eos> - A retreat?<eos> - The cardinal had this tunnel built.<eos> It leads inside the Vatican walls.
Gem smuggling in Burma...<eos> That's serious.<eos> We believe the charges are trumped up.<eos> You think they grabbed him to embarrass the U.S.?<eos> It's possible.<eos> Our relations with Burma aren't good.<eos> We're in the middle of trade negotiations that aren't moving.<eos> This is a kid with no criminal record, no prior travel or contacts in the region.<eos> I sympathize with your problem, but where do we come in?<eos> We've heard chatter that the ruby was smuggled out of Burma by someone else and that it's here in Manhattan.
Can you help?<eos> Christopher Harlowe is charged with stealing this...<eos> the Mandalay Ruby.<eos> It's a 237-carat pigeon blood.<eos> Pigeon blood?<eos> It's a local description of the deep-red color of the most prized Burmese gems.<eos> No pigeons were harmed in the mining of this ruby.<eos> I'll take mine medium rare.<eos> That's good to know.<eos> In the last year, it was held in a secured vault at a state mining facility, under army guard, in the middle of a jungle.
Boss, you could've chained him to the desk if you wanted to, but you didn't.<eos> Are you saying I want him to get that drive?<eos> I'm saying that you know Christopher's innocent and you're not exactly fond of diplomats.<eos> I don't want Neal to get caught.<eos> Well, you know where he is.<eos> All right, have your diplomatic friends on speed dial.<eos> If this goes wrong, Neal and I are gonna start an international incident.<eos> Mr. Caffrey, you're still here.<eos> Yeah, I wanted to make sure the ruby makes it home safely.<eos> I assure you that it will.
Look, I know I...<eos> I know.<eos> What do you need me for?<eos> You're not here to stop me?<eos> Savor this moment.<eos> Already savoring.<eos> Look, I'll spare you the details, but basically, the smoking jacket's not smoking.<eos> We need to stall.<eos> ...To anyone else, do not open this pouch.<eos> Guard it with your life, because it has everything that we need.
Who's a potential killer.<eos> That's not very comforting, mon frere.<eos> You think this is what Ford's after?<eos> Maybe Ford's trying to finish something he and Byron started. Mm.<eos> I can try and make it more legible.<eos> Hey, you mind hanging around the house the next few days?<eos> Oh, I'll make sure she's okay.<eos> Oh, we've got book club on for tomorrow anyway.<eos> I didn't know you two had a book club.<eos> It's very exclusive. Hmm.
I'm ready, fellas.<eos> This is a one-way radio, with GPS.<eos> You don't use wires anymore? Not since "Carlito's Way."<eos> FBI's gotten pretty slick.<eos> You sure you're up for this?<eos> Son, I once walked out of the met holding a Renoir.<eos> That was you? That was me.<eos> This ain't nothin'.<eos> Is that the guy?<eos> Who else would it be?
I'm in for this deal and then I'm out.<eos> -Out of what?<eos> -The lot.<eos> You want it, you can have it.<eos> You want an empire, you got your first brick.<eos> You can build on it or you can burn it down, I don't care.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because that's what me and Harvey agreed.<eos> I had nothing to gain from his death, nothing.<eos> It just made it harder.
Please, don't be frightened.<eos> I'm aware of your concerns.<eos> The time for answers has come.<eos> Red sky and red rain are not to be feared.<eos> Just the opposite.<eos> Like the healing centers and blue energy...<eos> That is why I was forced to wait until I had proof, to show you what it truly is.<eos> Red sky is a gift to mankind, a gift of a new beginning.<eos> Red sky will heal your oceans, make fertile your barren lands, and reverse global warming.<eos> It will undo a century of damage and give earth a new beginning.
Whoa, what?<eos> What do you mean, need me?<eos> Need me for what?<eos> - For the war.<eos> - Against the visitors.<eos> Everything that has happened since their arrival has been plotted.<eos> The healing centers, the blue energy...<eos> It is all part of their plan against us.<eos> Red sky is not Anna's latest gift.<eos> It is her latest weapon.
Can't it?<eos> Ginn?<eos> Okay, right there, that's the lumbar vein coming off the back of the renal vein.<eos> You want to cut that.<eos> Okay, got it.<eos> T.J., have you started the surgery yet?<eos> Uh, yes, sir, about 30 minutes ago.<eos> Well, Ginn had another choking attack.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> Yeah, she's okay. It passed, but I'm not waiting any longer.
I don't know.<eos> Destiny's mainframe just had a huge power surge.<eos> We lost imaging, database, everything.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Must have been some kind of power surge.<eos> Is it still transferring?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The mainframe is inaccessible.<eos> Anything?<eos> No, it's crashed.
'I am certain it's caused by eating.<eos> 'If I don't eat, I don't bleed, 'but then I get faint and they summon Curlew.<eos> 'Where is my angel?<eos> 'I have not seen her in so long.<eos> 'Perhaps I have not deserved her.'<eos> Some stains you never get out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You may sit up.<eos> I'm afraid all is not as it should be.<eos> Your womb has moved. It's much higher than where it ought to be, which is...
We have ruled your lives since your lives began.<eos> You should kill us all on sight, but you will never remember we were even here.<eos> Your will is ours.<eos> Yeah, well, sorry to disappoint you, but thanks.<eos> It's exactly what I needed to hear.<eos> This is a video phone.<eos> Whatever a video phone is.<eos> You should kill us all on sight.<eos> This suit, it seems to be repairing itself.<eos> How is it doing that?
This isn't possible.<eos> None of this is possible.<eos> A girl can dream.<eos> You run out of sugar?<eos> I got your scans back from today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Imaging shows enhancing masses across multiple lobes of Cuddy's lungs.<eos> That's what kidney cancer looks like when it metastasizes.
Jack has an infection that's spread to his mastoid.<eos> We'll confirm that in a week, when your secret cultures have sprouted.<eos> I only get mad when you waste my time.<eos> Couldn't care less about yours.<eos> But let me know when they come back negative, and I'll mock you.<eos> You have a better idea?<eos> Nope, so I'm gonna pick one at random.<eos> Acoustic neuroma.<eos> A tumor in the ear-- makes sense.<eos> And if it's putting pressure on the breathing centers in his brain, explains the lungs.
God damn it, no!<eos> I didn't hit her, Hold you.<eos> Why'd she kick you out?<eos> I threw her up against the fridge.<eos> She stole two ounces of coke from me.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> Adele doesn't snort cocaine.<eos> She sold it.<eos> Gave it away to that goddamn Rex, 'cause the shit's gone.<eos> She was the only other one knew where it was, then tonight, she comes up to the house with her car running like a watch.
Father!<eos> Give him to me.<eos> You are getting heavier and heavier.<eos> Miho. The food is ready.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Our gratitude, Father.<eos> For giving us this splendid fish.<eos> It is of no consequence.<eos> Forgive me, that is isn't much bigger.<eos> - It is huge!
Get over here.<eos> There you go.<eos> Oh, snap!<eos> Whoa, where does it lead?<eos> It leads to freedom, and $700 worth of pizza.<eos> Get in there.<eos> You make great cake.<eos> I never told you that, but I love...<eos> I bought it.<eos> And it was cheap.
Now it's time to drink and have slutty wedding sex.<eos> Where's Sylvia?<eos> What Chase kind of drink is this?<eos> It's my specialty -- the Blue Magellan.<eos> Enjoy the buzz.<eos> That's my line.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> That guy stole my line and my drink.<eos> That's not a Brain Blaster. No.<eos> It's delicious.
You can grab anything of mine you like.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Kev.<eos> That's nice and short and easy to whisper, like... (whispering):<eos> Do it again, Kev.<eos> (laughing): Uh-huh... yeah...<eos> Mr. Barkeep... a large boilermaker.<eos> And keep 'em comin'.<eos> Hey, did you bring in the water heater from the back porch? No.<eos> Well, it's not on the porch.
And it's gonna wipe out the town.<eos> I want any unstable projects secured and all GD personnel evacuated in 15 minutes.<eos> We only have 20.<eos> Well, that gives us five to spare.<eos> Take your security teams, do a sweep of the building, make sure no one gets left behind.<eos> Already in process and they're almost clear.<eos> Zane's almost got the P.A.L. system running again. - I'm going down.<eos> - Keep me apprised.<eos> Dr. Martin, you're overseeing the transfer of the FTL drive.<eos> Yes, it's already being moved to a secure location off-site.
Because she was his mistress.<eos> He dumped her.<eos> She menaced to tell all. So he shut her up.<eos> I have the printout of her calls.<eos> Sorry to disappoint you, no calls to the regional president.<eos> Can I see that?<eos> - It's a fake.<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> Candice received a call on Friday at her hairdressers.<eos> It's not here.
You didn't call her back?<eos> She often left me this kind of message.<eos> I didn't want to get sucked into her game anymore.<eos> Can I listen again?<eos> When you said shooting range I thought... You'd see me with a Beretta?<eos> You can choose your sport for the Canadian Police exams.<eos> Well?<eos> I heard something in the message.<eos> There's another engine in the background.<eos> The fan belt sounds like it's ready to snap.
There goes your tactical advantage.<eos> You want to keep them asleep as long as possible.<eos> Hmm.<eos> What if, um...<eos> What if we keep them asleep the whole time?<eos> 'Cause, like, there's just that one mech there during the day.<eos> So we send the recon team in.<eos> They break the lock on the back door.<eos> Then tonight they come in, and just one guy goes in alone.<eos> You know, he goes in, goes to Ben's room, kills the skitter while it's asleep.
Show people the truth.<eos> They've seen what she wanted them to see.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll weather this storm.<eos> You're on Anna's radar.<eos> That is not an easy storm to weather.<eos> Believe me, I've been there.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But I choose to have faith.<eos> - It's all I can rely on now.
You have just forgotten.<eos> All mothers, believe me.<eos> How do you know?<eos> She was talking about me?<eos> She spoke of you all the time.<eos> Every day.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She said...<eos> My son is my son.<eos> It is part of me, it is in me.
Let me help you.<eos> I can help you.<eos> I have a U.S. passport, come with me!<eos> You're not French?<eos> I am both.<eos> And we could even do...<eos> A marriage.<eos> I believe not a word.<eos> Let's see your passport.<eos> It is in the car.
- How long have you been there?<eos> - Long enough, but go ahead. If there's anything else you need to, uh... adjust.<eos> No, no. I think I am...<eos> I'm fully adjusted, though.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks for coming down here yesterday.<eos> Of course. Of course, you know...<eos> So I like the proposal.<eos> Got a lot of holes in it, but I think we can fix them and maybe make some money here.
I was married, once.<eos> She was a great girl. Very special.<eos> And then two years into the marriage, she got sick and...<eos> Even though she put up an incredible fight...<eos> - I'm very sorry. - It's OK.<eos> I'm OK.<eos> You know, something like that happens in your life, and it changes the way, well, you... see everything.<eos> So, since then, I try to keep things as simple as possible.<eos> I love my job, I love my work.<eos> It has its ups and downs, but at least it doesn't break your heart. So, what about you?
Lip, my boy.<eos> My oldest boy. Yeah.<eos> Here to pick up Karen.<eos> What's with the vest?<eos> Sheils made it.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi, Lip. Hi.<eos> Does my head look bigger?<eos> I don't think it can get any bigger, Dad.
- This is the police in Carcassonne.<eos> It's your wife, Mr Blick. She's been in a plane crash..<eos> My wife?<eos> There must be some mistake.<eos> She's in Spain with her car.<eos> Is your wife Anna Blick née Villandreux?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry but she's dead, Mr Blick.<eos> She was in a private jet, a two-seater.<eos> It crashed into the Montagne Noire.
Yeah, what does that have to do with this?<eos> Turned out they were squirrels.<eos> - You don't believe me.<eos> - I do, but we need to be specific.<eos> They're gonna ask me questions.<eos> Did you...<eos> No, but I heard him.<eos> I definitely heard him.<eos> Yeah, but actually see him? Did you see who was in the shed?<eos> - It was padlocked, OK? - OK!
Parents Night's tonight and they want Frank to show up, and he says he won't, so I got to go fix it before nobody shows up and he gets bounced.<eos> Sounds fun.<eos> I'll text ya later?<eos> Make it dirty.<eos> So, are you guys going to the parent-teacher conference tonight?<eos> No.<eos> Need a parent for that, don't you?<eos> Hey, Louise got an "A" on the paper you wrote for her English class.<eos> How do you keep doing that?<eos> Well, to master the art of the book report, you just take any novel, no matter when it was written, and you argue that the main character is a latent homosexual.
Admit it, Cardinal.<eos> There was no murder.<eos> He fought. He lost.<eos> I will search you out.<eos> You may find a nunnery but you will never be free of me!<eos> You would sample your brother's betrothed the way you would a mare?<eos> The Borgia pope has betrothed his son to King Ferrante's daughter.<eos> If there is a moment to move, it is now.<eos> Do you accept Sancia as your lawful spouse? I do.<eos> You will have your war, but it will be fought the French way.
Not bad.<eos> Go on.<eos> The girl, who is she?<eos> is she just a runaway?<eos> Or just some 12 or 13 year old girl ... that looks much older than she really is.<eos> A Vagrant? Homeless?<eos> Why the wooden stake?<eos> - Yeah, why?<eos> What, did that kill her?<eos> Or was it something that was added later? As a calling card for the real killer?

The fog ... floated out like Virginia's silent ... dream.<eos> No, that sucks.<eos> The fog on the lake, the fog on the ...<eos> The fog on the lake ... just to torture Sam.<eos> The scent floats out like ... tears.<eos> On a whale's ass?<eos> No.<eos> The fog on the lake...the flake. The straight edge razor.<eos> The fog on the lake reminds me of my first wife.<eos> It dissipated with time.
The tone?<eos> - They'll tell you.<eos> These points being settled... shall we consider the reframe? - I like it.<eos> The bell tower is becoming to me.<eos> A reframe must be brief.<eos> In my own work, my most famous... it's lead me at once to a single word is the best... I'm afraid.<eos> Never more.<eos> The difficulty arose from the presumption that the word ... must be monopolously be spoken by a human being.<eos> then immediately arose the idea of a, a non reasoning creature capable of speech ... and, then very naturally a parrot suggested itself.<eos> But it was superceded forthwith immediately by a raven as equally ... capable of speech, but as a bird of ill omen ... infinitely more in keeping within intent to turn.
and he from the horizon, the entire circle embracing... a dark day for our poor, even sadder than the nights.<eos> I was hoping you could help me find this missing girl.<eos> She is 12 or 13.<eos> There are a lot of girls here.<eos> You know, people are saying what's going on up here is...evil.<eos> Are you worried about that?<eos> Look around you.<eos> Does this look evil to you?<eos> Look at that moon.<eos> It is beautiful.
- Oh, hi, Anna.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You fancy a cup of tea?<eos> Yeah. OK.<eos> I actually might stop off and go to T opshop after work.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> - Do you want to come with?<eos> - Oh, yes, let's, let's.<eos> So I read your thing.<eos> It's good.
- Bye, angel.<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> - These are for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, they're lovely.<eos> - How was your flight?<eos> - It was good, yeah.
There'll still be plenty of crime in the city when he's gone.<eos> Our caseload for the week.<eos> How is anyone supposed to get a good defense with a caseload like this?<eos> Ark is out of control, Travis.<eos> Arrests are up 200 %.<eos> It's becoming a police state out there.<eos> Crime is down.<eos> The people are happy.<eos> Look, our job isn't to bring down the system.<eos> It's to bring down this pile, one file at a time.
She likes it in the morning.<eos> Oh, yeah, she certainly does.<eos> Gupta!<eos> Aah!<eos> Next time, it'll be a real brick.<eos> I'm sorry, rajiv.<eos> It's my chair.<eos> I need a new one.<eos> That chair is more valuable to this company Than you are.<eos> It's dependable.
Just back off, troy, please?<eos> I could, or... You could man up and try to make me.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> I think I'm drunk.<eos> Finally.<eos> I cannot believe how much you've had.<eos> It is impressive, even for a 300-pound dockworker.<eos> But shh!<eos> I have a secret.<eos> I have a really fast metabolism, and it works quicklier than other people's.
You kidding?<eos> I'm already the envy of all my frat buddies.<eos> They won't leave me alone.<eos> - When did you graduate?<eos> Have you ever heard of a boy named Nick Baldwin?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> A colleague of mine just told me something that I never knew before.<eos> There is no such thing as a bonsai tree seed.<eos> Instead, you take the seed of a healthy tree and infect it with a fungus that genetically alters it's root system.<eos> It's called Apiosporina collinsii.
What if something bad happened to me?<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> The lights went because of the rain, and the dog scared you, that's all.<eos> No?<eos> What happened?<eos> I think there's a ghost.<eos> - Fabian:-1...<eos> - Don't laugh, I'm serious.<eos> What ghost?<eos> Where is it?

Go ahead and enter.<eos> No, he can not enter.<eos> Nassim is tired.<eos> He come near him.<eos> You do not seem to understand.<eos> He has mumps.<eos> It's contagious.<eos> It's dangerous for boys.<eos> We have enough problems!<eos> It is a force of nature.
- The elephant, we could take a drive.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who was that?<eos> No one of any consequence.<eos> If you're hungry, there's a soda fountain.<eos> They sell potato cakes called cornishes.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - This guide.<eos> It lists the taverns, the houses of ill repute.
Well--<eos> What did she take?<eos> Us.<eos> You're not even making any sense.<eos> How can someone take "us"?<eos> By making it impossible for me to feel anything for you.<eos> Ever.<eos> Well, that's ridiculous.<eos> And--<eos> Anyway, at the rave, tonight, that kiss, it was-
You ask this now?<eos> I know he is to be sold tomorrow.<eos> I would have final words, before he departs.<eos> I would share drink.<eos> With an old friend.<eos> Is that all that I am?<eos> A friend?<eos> Gannicus...<eos> I do not care for honey in my wine.<eos> It serves only to mask bitter taste.
I desire to see you suffer.<eos> As I have suffered at your fucking hands.<eos> Your suffering has only begun, lanista.<eos> When it is discovered what you have done to me!<eos> You will not be discovered. Nor missed.<eos> Solonius moves young Vettius, towards offering proper explanation for your disappearance.<eos> Vettius?<eos> The city will mourn.<eos> Soon your name will be spoken of less and less.<eos> Until it is lost to history.
An hour? Five seconds?<eos> Er, somewhere in between.<eos> All right? Oh, Rory!<eos> Oh, Rory.<eos> There's a way out.<eos> Jennifer found it.<eos> A secret tunnel under the crypt.<eos> From the crypt?<eos> It's not on the schematics.<eos> It runs right out of the monastery.
Co-produced by<eos> With the support of<eos> Herr Lange, would you come with me?<eos> Hello, Träger's my name.<eos> Here's the brain. The right hemisphere, left hemisphere.<eos> Things are fine over here... but that's where you see the tumour, right.<eos> It's about four or five centimetres below the cranium.
Co-produced by<eos> With the support of<eos> Herr Lange, would you come with me?<eos> Hello, Träger's my name.<eos> Here's the brain. The right hemisphere, left hemisphere.<eos> Things are fine over here... but that's where you see the tumour, right.<eos> It's about four or five centimetres below the cranium.<eos> Its contours are blurred, and it's spread into healthy brain tissue, bits where tissue is disintegrating.
It's advisable to see the illness as a friend, like something that wishes you well.<eos> It's like an alarm going off. Taking stock.<eos> Rest! Look around. Am I living the way I want to live?<eos> Or rather...<eos> Am I in a position... where I'm at one with the world?<eos> Regain my equilibrium, some harmony.<eos> As long as your life lasts, it must be worth living.<eos> No one can really tell you... how the illness progresses.<eos> Or if the tumour might stop.<eos> Nor do you know if it should grow.
Did you want two more?<eos> You've got two already.<eos> Well...<eos> Russia would take part in a missile defence system, according to Nato general secretary Rasmussen speaking during consultations with President Medvedev in Lisbon.<eos> Medvedev insisted on equal partnership, according to sources.<eos> It was decided at the Nato summit to withdraw troops from Afghanistan next year.<eos> Berlin.<eos> Little hope in the Frank Lange case.<eos> According to a health ministry spokesman Frank Lange's brain tumour had, in spite of radiation and chemotherapy, grown by a further two-and-a-half centimetres.<eos> It is thus twice as big as when...
Got us some cake...<eos> You shouldn't.<eos> Sorry about yesterday.<eos> You're going bald.<eos> There's no point, radiotherapy, and the chemo-treatment.<eos> Just wait for it.<eos> - Wait for what?<eos> The cremation casket would be similar to this one.<eos> Not identical but similar in style.<eos> Quite sparse, without any embellishments. Since it's going to be incinerated anyway.
All the railroads and utility companies...<eos> All that property and all that wonderful money... Now it all goes back in the box.<eos> None of it was really yours.<eos> You got all heated up about it for a while.<eos> But it was around a long time before you sat down at the board and it will be here after you're gone - players come - players go.<eos> Houses and cars...<eos> Titles and clothes... Even your body."<eos> Because the fact is that everything I clutch and consume and hoard is going to go back in the box and I'm going to lose it all.<eos> So you have to ask yourself when you finally get the ultimate promotion when you have made the ultimate purchase when you buy the ultimate home when you have stored up financial security and climbed the ladder of success to the<eos> highest rung you can possibly climb it... and the thrill wears off

And how about war?<eos> The war industry in America is a huge driver of GDP - one of the most profitable industries - producing weapons of death and destruction.<eos> The favorite game of this industry is to blow things up and then can go and rebuild them, for profit.<eos> We saw this with the windfall billion dollar contracts made from the Iraq war.<eos> The bottom line is that socially negative attributes of society have become positively rewarded ventures for industry and any interest in problem resolution or environmental sustainability and conservation is intrinsically counter to economic sustainability.<eos> And this is why every time you see the GDP rise in any country you are witnessing an increase in necessity whether real or contrived and by definition, a necessity is rooted in inefficiency.<eos> Hence, increased necessity means increased inefficiency.<eos> [Value System Disorder]<eos> The American dream is based on the rampant consumerism.<eos> It is based upon the fact that mainstream media and especially commercial advertising
Because the slightly brain-damaged person has no empathy.<eos> That's the key.<eos> If you don't have any empathy you do well as an investor and so Wall Street breeds people who have no empathy.<eos> To go in there and to make decisions and to make trades they have no compunction about no thought whatsoever as to how what they are doing might affect their fellow human being.<eos> So they breed these robots.<eos> These people who have no souls and since they don't even want to pay these people anymore- they are now breeding robots – real robots – real algorithmic traders.<eos> Goldman Sachs in the high frequency trading scandal:<eos> they put a computer next to the New York Stock Exchange.<eos> This computer, this "co-located" computer, as they call it:<eos> it front-runs all the trades on the exchange and hits the exchange with volumes of orders in ways that "scalp" pennies and nickels away from the exchange.
The brokers bribe to the office manager the office manager bribes to the regional sales manager.<eos> The regional sales manager bribes to the national sales manager.<eos> It's a common understanding.<eos> At Christmas, who gets the biggest bonus at Christmas in an average broker job?<eos> The compliance officer.<eos> The compliance officer sits there all day long;<eos> he's supposed to be making sure you don't violate any of the margin rules and you're "complying" with the law.<eos> Of course, yeah, to the extent that you can bribe the compliance officer yeah, that's right, you are complying with the law!<eos> So how has fraud become the system?<eos> It's no longer a byproduct.

to an assessment of the amount of fish in the ocean to the most prime arable land for food cultivation, etc.<eos> But, since we humans are going to be consuming these resources over time we then realize that not only do we need to locate and identify- we also need to track.<eos> We need to make sure we don't run out of any of this stuff... that would be bad.<eos> And this means not only tracking our rates of use but the rates of earthly regeneration as well such as how long it takes for, say a tree to grow or a spring to replenish.<eos> This is called "Dynamic Equilibrium".<eos> In other words, if we use up trees faster than they can be grown back- we have a serious problem, for it is unsustainable.<eos> So then, how do we track this inventory especially when we recognize that all of this stuff is scattered everywhere.<eos> We have large mineral mines in what we call Africa energy concentrations in the Middle East huge tidal power possibilities on the Atlantic coast of North America the largest supply of fresh water in Brazil, etc.<eos> Well, once again, good old science has a suggestion:<eos> it's called "Systems theory".
Systems theory recognizes that the fabric of the natural world from human biology to the earthly biosphere to the gravitational pull of the solar system itself is one huge synergistically connected system - fully interlinked.<eos> Just as human cells connect to form our organs and the organs connect to form our bodies and since our bodies cannot live without the earthy resources of food, air and water, we are intrinsically connected to the earth.<eos> And so on.<eos> So - as nature suggests, we take all of this inventory and tracking data and create a "system" to manage it.<eos> A "Global Resource Management System", in fact to account for every relevant resource on the planet.<eos> There is simply no logical alternative if our goal as a species is survival in the long run.<eos> We have to keep track as a whole.<eos> That understood, we can now consider production.<eos> How do we use all this stuff?<eos> What will our process of production be and what do we need to consider to make sure it is as optimized as possible to maximize our sustainability?
Very good.<eos> Now, let's get down to specifics:<eos> First we need the consider the core infrastructure or intestines of the city organism.<eos> These would be the water, goods waste and energy transport channels.<eos> Just as we have water and sewage systems under our cities today we would extend this channeling concept to integrate waste recycling and delivery itself.<eos> No more mailmen or garbage men.<eos> It is built right in.<eos> We could even use automated pneumatic tubes and similar technologies.<eos> Same goes for transport.<eos> It needs to be integrated and strategically designed to reduce or even remove the need for wasteful, independent automobiles.
- You do realize that technically it's her house.<eos> - Look, I'm sorry that she died and she never got married and-and she doesn't know how to move on, but seriously, I mean, the whole point of this house was having one place where monsters aren't,<eos> where you don't have to apologize or hide or think about what we are. Where we can eat pizza, or pretend to eat pizza, where we can be human for, like, just an hour or 2.<eos> - And from what I know about ghosts, a ghost isn't a ghost without a reason.<eos> Sally, everything she knows about ghosts seems to come from Whoopi Goldberg.<eos> She knows nothing, Josh.<eos> Would you please give her a chance to find her way?<eos> - Where the hell are we?<eos> - They just cleared this place out for expansion, but that could take years.<eos> It's perfect, isn't it?
There is no use in the religion for a tongue that is not pierced with needles.<eos> It means nothing just to put a tongue in a dish.<eos> If it's not part of the ritual, then it's the unsub's signature.<eos> His psychopathy is showing.<eos> So he's silencing someone through his victims.<eos> And he enjoys it. He just didn't know it at first.<eos> Elian is an angry child, but he would not do this.<eos> Please, let me find him before it gets worse.<eos> Thank you for your help.<eos> Your head is spinning because it's full of ghosts.
He's the perfect culprit.<eos> So you took his jacket and wellies and Petitpas' car, but you forgot to push the seat back.<eos> And the shells you left on Rosalie were dirty.<eos> You should have known Damien cleaned his.<eos> And I raped her?<eos> With a stick and a condom of the same brand you used with Emmanuel.<eos> Bernard can testify, I was with him.<eos> Right, the asthma attack.<eos> You made sure that Bernard checks the time.<eos> You set the time on your alarm to create an alibi, but you made a mistake and it rang 12 hours later, when I was there.
"Chapter One :<eos> The Movers"<eos> Big Brother, they're all booked!<eos> Then negotiate mano a mano!<eos> Go!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> The bitch slipped a frog down my throat.<eos> A frog? !<eos> It's stuck.
I don't need to tell you people what's at stake.<eos> We all been living on the edge since these alien things came.<eos> Tomorrow's assault on the structure in Boston was meant to be a first strike -- a coordinated attack with the support of two other Massachusetts regiments.<eos> However... Colonel Porter lost contact with these regiments several days ago.<eos> And now it looks as if the Colonel himself might have been lost.<eos> Dai brought back the Colonel's last order -- abort the mission unless we can confirm the existence of these other units.<eos> We still don't know if these other units exist... Or if they intend to carry out the attack as planned.<eos> But I know... That if there's a breath left... In any of those men, they will do their damnedest to carry out this attack.<eos> And if that happens, despite Porter's order... The 2nd Mass has to be there to back them up.<eos> But this attack, as critical as it is, cannot be our only objective.
There was a witness who said he thought he saw the kid get into a car, but Francis wasn't having any of it.<eos> He was convinced the kid never left the block;<eos> that he was murdered.<eos> He'll find the forensic anthropologist's report there as well.<eos> Blunt force trauma to the skull was caused by the round striking end of a hammer.<eos> His own kids were that age back then.<eos> It tore him up.<eos> It's the losses that keep you up at night.<eos> How'd your anniversary go?<eos> It was good.
We know she was out there.<eos> And we tracked her for a while.<eos> We have to make this an organised effort.<eos> Daryl knows the woods better than anybody.<eos> I've asked him to oversee this.<eos> Is that blood?<eos> - We took down a walker.<eos> - Walker?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> There was no sign it was ever anywhere near Sophia.
The inside of the barrel was filed down.<eos> We couldn't make a match.<eos> He's hiding his trail.<eos> What about prints?<eos> The outside of the gun was wiped down.<eos> Agent Roe. What's Department of Justice doing here? Forensics found a single print inside the weapon.<eos> It was yours, agent Burke.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> The print was found inside the slide.<eos> The only way it could have gotten there was if you assembled the gun.
Every day, Bilal takes a regular route from his apartment to the yacht club.<eos> Diana, you're gonna flash your badge and scare him into making a call to Larssen.<eos> I can scare him. I know.<eos> You're gonna do it in front of this phone booth.<eos> Jones, you'll install a transmitter which will reroute any call that he makes to us.<eos> Yeah, but nobody uses pay phones in New York anymore.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Mozzie, do you still have your cellphone scrambler?<eos> Russian surplus with a two-block radius.<eos> But it's cumbersome.
I swear on my nephew's grave.<eos> I don't know, Franz seems like such a nice old man.<eos> Y-You know, maybe we should just invite him for dinner and clear this whole thing up.<eos> Yeah, you know, we got no right passing judgment without getting to know him.<eos> Isn't that right, Scottish Chipmunk?<eos> Yeah, he doesn't talk, but, uh, he's a chipmunk, and he's Scottish, and he would back me up on this.<eos> Chris, wait. Where you going?<eos> I'm going to Mr. Gutentag's house.<eos> You can't. Why not?<eos> Chris, his name isn't Gutentag, it's Schlechtnacht, and he's a Nazi.
Ellen Only Talks When Her Guest ls Talking.<eos> So, you want to hear about my movie?<eos> - I had a great weekend.<eos> - We spent three months shooting in Louisiana.<eos> - I danced all over my house.<eos> - I also listen to jazz while I vacuum, which is cool.<eos> - It's really a love story, too.<eos> - I try to dance in every room<eos> - at least once a week.<eos> Anyway, it comes out Friday.

- Judy, I...<eos> - I did it. What possible excuse could you have for this?<eos> I'm from New York.<eos> We think getting minors drunk is funny.<eos> There's nothing funny about getting minors drunk!<eos> You should be ashamed, Lily!<eos> Ashamed!<eos> Oh, cripes, that's tasty.<eos> That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days.<eos> Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts.
How can you not remember my name?<eos> It's like they never challenge each other.<eos> They just automatically agree all the time.<eos> Well, they don't do that all the time. Yes, they do.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> It's like they don't see eye-to-eye on anything!<eos> Totally.<eos> Totally.<eos> It rhymes with your name.
Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall? Oh!<eos> Ugh! You are worse than my shrink.<eos> "Barney, we have to talk about your father."<eos> "Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people.<eos> You'll only use it for evil."<eos> "Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session<eos> "between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute." I don't need this!<eos> Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple!<eos> I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks.<eos> Your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her...
You wouldn't just...<eos> You wouldn't just... yeah...<eos> No, Barney.<eos> I wouldn't just fire him.<eos> I'd also fire you.<eos> Come again for Big Fudge?<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> ! I can't be unemployed, Robin!<eos> My job is my identity;<eos> It's who I am.
You wouldn't just... yeah...<eos> No, Barney.<eos> I wouldn't just fire him.<eos> I'd also fire you.<eos> Come again for Big Fudge?<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> ! I can't be unemployed, Robin!<eos> My job is my identity;<eos> It's who I am.<eos> It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.
My stars!<eos> Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby?<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> This is a nightmare.<eos> I can't believe she kept that tape.<eos> The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...<eos> They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place. Yeah.<eos> We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head.<eos> Better get used to that lion head.<eos> As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times.
Motion denied.<eos> Zoey...<eos> Zoey!<eos> All right, what do you have to say for yourself? I don't know.<eos> Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore.<eos> You may now say what you really think of Zoey.<eos> I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head.<eos> It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance.

I mean that.<eos> Ah.<eos> Oh, man, that is, uh...<eos> That is...<eos> good... stuff.<eos> Sometimes we can be right bastards.<eos> Oh.<eos> You've been listening to the dulcet pipes of my beloved homeland.<eos> Don't bother trying to dig out the receiver, lad.<eos> It's glued to your inner eardrum.
No, no, I will not chill.<eos> And what was all that about liking having her around?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I like having her around.<eos> Yeah, but around what?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I think when you say "around," you mean under.<eos> Don't go down that road, Alan.<eos> Oh, oh, why shouldn't I go down that road?<eos> Is it slippery when wet?
Thanks.<eos> This is really helping.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Really.<eos> You gonna watch?<eos> I'll get you a refill instead.<eos> I know it's not my business, and feel free to believe in God, but the thing is you've got to make it okay somehow, no matter what happens.<eos> Before it happened, we were standing there in the woods and this deer just crossed right in front of us.<eos> I swear, it just planted itself there and looked Carl right in the eye.
You're this wasted, buddy?<eos> It's not even 5:00.<eos> Hey.<eos> Your friend okay?<eos> I'll take care of him.<eos> Sleep it off.<eos> It's The Red Hot Sushi.<eos> Let's keep it that way.<eos> You don't like my singing, huh?<eos> It's not that bad.
- I'm not talking to you.<eos> I want to talk to the queen alone.<eos> Unless she's scared.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Respect!<eos> What do you want?<eos> - I want a chance.<eos> - What for?<eos> For a fight.<eos> Ooh, I like the sound of it!
Ask him to call me.<eos> Until then, just give him beer.<eos> There you go.<eos> - Beer?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We are millionaires, and you come back with beer?<eos> Now you have more drink.<eos> This guy, Lasse, at the Pink Heaven, wouldn't sell me spirits when he heard that it was for you.
I can search here for a month with agents and dogs while you stay here for four weeks until you know why you had that gun.<eos> Shall we do that?<eos> Or do we let your subconscious awareness...<eos> - There!<eos> - Good boy!<eos> Good boy!<eos> That's our Oscar!<eos> Gina!<eos> I'm not sure if that head will still be there.<eos> It ​​may have been eaten or something.
All right, this is a high-priority payload.<eos> Get me somebody on the ground.<eos> ALEX:<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> MAN:<eos> I got the grab-team leader on the line.<eos> - Now is not a good time.<eos> [PHONE BEEPS]<eos> Estrin, a jet's waiting at the rendezvous.<eos> It'll take you and the payload back to HQ.
We're on our way.<eos> It's right over here.<eos> We're looking for two.<eos> Any sign of the other one?<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> Well, I guess one baby zebra's better than none.<eos> You're not wrong but unless I'm mistaken, that's not a zebra.<eos> What?<eos> This animal's not a zebra.<eos> It's a quagga. It's an equine species native to South Africa.
I want to talk to you.<eos> Now, honey, you're gonna live here from now on.<eos> Don't give me that look.<eos> It wasn't anything you did.<eos> You've been the best dog I could ever have asked for, and I love you very much.<eos> So... stay away from cars... don't eat anything pointy... and be a good girl.<eos> Goodbye, Stella-Bella.<eos> I didn't think I'd get through that without crying. Me neither.<eos> Hey, dad, check out this video.<eos> It's a teacup pig playing a piano.
Go on.<eos> And come straight home... put on our jammies, and fall asleep in front of the TV.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Looking forward to it already.<eos> Ew, but not those ones I hate, those red satin pajamas.<eos> I don't even know where those are.<eos> I know I'll get over it, but right now I hate Anders and Cooper.<eos> Our dear friends Anders and Cooper got married last Valentine's day, and we wanted to get them something really special.<eos> - We found this exquisite little painting... - Oh of a winery in Napa that we all visited last year.<eos> It was a... bit pricey, but they're really judge-y and we knew they'd love it.
- I thought we were in love. - Mm.<eos> You think you know the person sleeping in the next bedroom.<eos> I'll get us some drinks.<eos> So sad.<eos> Yeah, it doesn't have to be.<eos> If it's really love, you do everything you need to do to get back what you once had.<eos> You're talking about the painting, right?<eos> Of course I am 'cause we don't owe him that anymore. - Go get it!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Go get it.
Carmelina, are you trying to be deported?<eos> ! All right, I got it back.<eos> What is that?<eos> This is Anders' wedding present to us.<eos> He must have swapped it out when he opened that monstrosity that he thinks we got him.<eos> We're getting our painting back. - Go.<eos> - Me?<eos> No, no. You've already done a recon of the room.<eos> You need to do this.<eos> Okay, take it easy, "Mission Impossible." It's a bed and a couch, not a laser maze.
Sammy Saltzman sounds so silly.<eos> We can overhand shuffle, and we can riffle shuffle... But, you know, there is no escape from the angry...<eos> - queen.<eos> - What?<eos> Phil. What are you doing?<eos> Making the best of a bad situation?<eos> Why is that woman rubbing your shoulders?<eos> Oh, uh, Jillian is a masseuse, and this, of course, is Edward Legrand.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> Now, if you could just give me my ace of spades back-- it's in your pocket.
Three if need be.<eos> Whatever's best for my mother.<eos> This... ow... this is torturous, but it pains me more that you are enjoying this so.<eos> Oh, it hurts, I'm sure.<eos> Do you know what else hurts?<eos> Poison!<eos> My stomach still aches from your efforts to slowly kill me.<eos> Francis, I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me, and everything you're doing.<eos> The new château isn't just for you.<eos> It's for the both of us.

I don't want to make the same mistakes as those people tonight.<eos> I don't want to kill something out of ignorance.<eos> So does that mean you're willing to forgive me?<eos> I mean that I want to see your heart, Kenna, and not just one part of it, the entire truth of it, no matter how dark.<eos> Because that's what marriage is all about.<eos> - It can take years to see what's inside.<eos> - Years?<eos> Bash, my heart really isn't that complicated.<eos> Trust me, your heart is complicated.<eos> It's like one of those drinks at Christmas with too much spice.
If I were lying to you, I wouldn't say what I'm about to say.<eos> But since the fate of the world depends on you believing me...<eos> The Horseman's ally, the witch... is your wife Katrina.<eos> May God have mercy on your soul.<eos> Crane, wait.<eos> She's pregnant with your son.<eos> You'll see for yourself.<eos> That's it.<eos> Hey, Crane, look at my cell phone.<eos> It's the black rectangular thing that they confiscated from me.
Where are they?<eos> Keep what you fancy.<eos> Has Sutton transferred her?<eos> Not yet.<eos> He was planning to pay her a visit though.<eos> God's... wounds.<eos> The password is... my birthday.<eos> What devilry is this?<eos> I fail to understand why you can't simply take this picture.<eos> - 'Cause then it wouldn't be a selfie.
Yes. As you said.<eos> Everything you said is true.<eos> We're partners.<eos> More than that.<eos> We're friends.<eos> That's a relief.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's a system of tunnels beneath the town.<eos> I know.<eos> It gets us halfway to Fredericks Manor.
Thank you.<eos> There's a system of tunnels beneath the town.<eos> I know.<eos> It gets us halfway to Fredericks Manor.<eos> I didn't want to believe you.<eos> Then I went home to Katrina.<eos> She must be with child.<eos> I'm sure this is all incredibly hard.<eos> I saw a book.<eos> It resembles your description of the Grimoire.
Benjamin Franklin said that you would know how to reverse the Traveler Spell.<eos> Uh... the Abiero spell will return you to the moment the spell was cast.<eos> But it-it, it will require a great deal of power.<eos> I will have to draw on the energies that normally shield this house.<eos> So, we'll be vulnerable to attack?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then we should commence.<eos> We found your journal.<eos> My mom, my sister.<eos> It's guided us, helped us fight evil.

But was impossible to know if it would be remembered, saved or wind up in the proper hands.
Louis made this all by himself.<eos> Last time I was here, he got the straw from his juice box stuck in his nose.<eos> He also got it unstuck.<eos> Uh, check it out.<eos> So, uh, so we'll take a piece of bread, all right?<eos> Put it in the mouth, where the saliva will start to dissolve the bread.<eos> And then it'll travel down to the stomach, where the acids will break down the complex carbohydrates.<eos> At which point it will move past the appendix, which does nothing.<eos> Yeah, we should rename that the Alan.<eos> Uh, and then it'll go to the small intestines, the large intestines, where finally...
He probably came home, saw that Eva was about to leave him, and killed her in a fit of rage.<eos> I told her everything was gonna be all right.<eos> I promised her.<eos> I'm sorry, babe.<eos> Have you heard from detective Neely?<eos> She said that search teams didn't find anything in the woods.<eos> Yeah. That's because Cole knew he couldn't leave her out there, not once I was onto him, so he put her back in the car and dumped it and the body someplace else.<eos> Westchester has got a bolo out on Eva's car, and they've flagged her credit cards.<eos> Have they pinged her cellphone?<eos> They tried, but it's either off or dead.
Well, and I happen to know from experience that it's never a waste of time to look for the good in someone.<eos> This woman left her kids to go be a den mother to a family of vampires.<eos> I think we're gonna be looking for quite a while.<eos> Well, then it's a good thing we have forever.<eos> That wasn't terrible.<eos> See?<eos> Control is overrated.<eos> I don't even remember how we got back to my room.<eos> Where's my shirt?<eos> It's near the girl we left bleeding out in the hallway.
Why can't there be like a air-borne gout that just kills rich people?<eos> I'd like to wake up to news that Monaco had been wiped out by an avalanche of poorly built palaces.<eos> We're getting a little off...<eos> Do you know what percentage of greenhouse gases ~ Bangladesh produces?<eos> ~ No.<eos> Roughly zero.<eos> But Bangladesh is being eaten by the ocean while we drive Range Rovers to the mall to buy underpants that were stitched by a seven-year-old, who literally, in 2015, is an indentured servant.<eos> Let's just say slaves, because their life is shit, in a ditch.<eos> It's not even shit in a toilet.<eos> Well, it won't get fixed by some whining idiot lying in bed lecturing a pregnant woman, will it?
That's sweet.<eos> See ya around, kid.<eos> That was incredible.<eos> I've never felt like that before.<eos> - You were awesome!<eos> - You were awesome!<eos> Look, my heart is beating out of my chest.<eos> You feel it?<eos> Here, mine is, too. Feel it!<eos> Feel it.
You know, it's like, I mean, I do it all the time, so why should tonight be any different?<eos> You're cute, kid.<eos> I like you.<eos> Cool.<eos> Coop, what are you wearing?<eos> Coop!<eos> Really going for it!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yaron lent me the earring and the vest, and Donna gave me the shirt.<eos> - I think it looks rad.
I like you.<eos> Cool.<eos> Coop, what are you wearing?<eos> Coop!<eos> Really going for it!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yaron lent me the earring and the vest, and Donna gave me the shirt.<eos> - I think it looks rad.<eos> - Oh, thanks.<eos> Actually, it's not red. It's more maroon.
You want me to help you get McKernon so you can make partner.<eos> I want you to help me so I can keep my word to Avery McKernon.<eos> And when I become partner, I'll keep my word to you.<eos> What the hell word is that?<eos> That someday what you wrote on that napkin goes up on the goddamn wall.<eos> You seem to have done a lot of work here, Mike.<eos> Oh, it's no big deal.<eos> It is a big deal.<eos> Mike found a loophole in the Immigration Act of 1975, and it's gonna blow you away.<eos> I don't know about that, but it may help Hector Suarez stay in the country.
Or maybe more...<eos> Every time Don Florencio takes his family out on the boat, I house-sit for him.<eos> Does the son always go with them?<eos> They always go together.<eos> They're a close-knit family.<eos> - How long have they had the boat?<eos> - Around...five years.<eos> When can we see inside the house?<eos> With them gone, anytime you want.<eos> It's 271 cm long and 60 wide.

- Around...five years.<eos> When can we see inside the house?<eos> With them gone, anytime you want.<eos> It's 271 cm long and 60 wide.<eos> - It's really nice.<eos> - Do you sail?<eos> Yes, for two years now. I'm learning.<eos> I'm about 150 pounds.<eos> Will it hold ok?<eos> Sure. It's good for up to 205 pounds.
- Can I hitch a ride to the garage? - Sure.<eos> - Is it OK if my accountant comes too. - Yes, of course.<eos> - Thank you ever so much.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Don't mention it.<eos> - Mr Laborde, Mr Naum.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> He's a very old friend of mine.<eos> - What's wrong with the car?<eos> - I'm not sure. It just gave up the ghost.
- The land belonged to my grandparents.<eos> - It was all one big estate.<eos> Then we sold it off in lots.<eos> This is the last plot left.<eos> We used to come here and play with our cousins.<eos> How big is the plot?<eos> Well it's about... It's approximately 18 metres wide and 50 metres long.<eos> I love it!<eos> It's perfect for you guys.<eos> - Nice, isn't it, Alex? - Yes.
Yeah, wanted to let you guys know.<eos> - He okay?<eos> - Banged up, but he'll recover.<eos> Hard part comes now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You gonna be okay for the weekend?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Can you still take Christopher?<eos> - I don't want to go.<eos> - Chris, it's Dad's weekend.
Safer from what?<eos> Tobias, please, don't screw yourself like this.<eos> You've been working your ass off.<eos> You're on track to go to college.<eos> Yeah, no one's going to college.<eos> No one's doing anything they think they are. What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Can I get my knife back, please?<eos> No, you can't get your knife back.<eos> They say it's not connected.
I'm not asking a favour.<eos> You've no choice.<eos> You're in the family.<eos> We're supporting your mother.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> How do you think she can afford that place?<eos> Who's the owner?<eos> She is.<eos> Her father, my grandfather, gave it to her.<eos> It's mine.
Stay here till we've gone.<eos> OK?<eos> Hurry up, we're out of our zone.<eos> Don't panic, beauty, I won't be long.<eos> "Beauty"?<eos> Whatever! My client can't do without his daily spa!<eos> Even when it's raining.<eos> Nice one, eh?<eos> Here.<eos> Know how it works?
- Would you like some tea?<eos> - No, I ought to get back to the flat.<eos> What are you up here for?<eos> You never said. Oh, I don't see why I shouldn't tell you.<eos> I'll have to tell everyone soon.<eos> I'm thinking of giving up... driving.<eos> Racing, that is.<eos> Goodness.<eos> Does Mary know?<eos> She knows I've lost the joy of it, yes.
But you can be fond of someone and not work as hard as that.<eos> - It does me good to hear you say such things.<eos> - I don't mean anyway by it.<eos> Oh, that's your story and you're sticking to it.<eos> Oh, hello. What can I do for you?<eos> Just looked in to say good night.<eos> We're going.<eos> Oh, back to the carefree love-nest.<eos> - I hope.<eos> - Oh, it's a love-nest, all right.
Ma'am.<eos> If this is a family dinner, what's Narcisse doing here?<eos> We made a discovery, Stephan and I, about my recent hallucinations.<eos> I know the thinking was that I was ill...<eos> Syphilitic, you mean.<eos> Diseased.<eos> But in fact I was poisoned.<eos> By our family Bible, the one that your father used to read for comfort, as did I, after his death.<eos> Now, the poison had affected our personalities, each differently.<eos> It also altered my palate.
All I meant was...<eos> Well, you're the closest thing I have to family, to be honest, and losing that connection hurt, that's all.<eos> But I understand completely.<eos> I do.<eos> Lady Kenna.<eos> I'm glad to see you again.<eos> Will you and your husband be coming to the meal tonight?<eos> You mean the dinner for your brother?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> It's royals only, and Bash is working this evening anyway.
Driver, why are we stopping?<eos> Another stout for you?<eos> I can't drink my dinner again tonight.<eos> I don't suppose you could spare a tiny piece of that game hen I'm smelling?<eos> No cash, no bird.<eos> A heartrending sight.<eos> To see a lady of your beauty and obvious charm seated here alone.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have such beautiful hair.<eos> It's like spun silk.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Thinking about Charlotte?<eos> - Actually, no.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> If... if you don't want to talk about it, I-I totally understand.<eos> And if you don't feel like partying either, I could check up on Aubrey.<eos> We can't do anything anyway until her blood work comes back.<eos> Aubrey's blood work is back.<eos> It didn't pick up anything.
There's a hat in the bag, too. Try it on.<eos> Put it on.<eos> That's very nice.<eos> Take it off, you're in a restaurant.<eos> Sure about this?<eos> It's not too late to bail.<eos> We're going.<eos> It's the right thing to do.<eos> Look, we'll be in and out of there in five minutes.<eos> It'll be so packed, no one will notice.
- Allen Iverson.<eos> - "...you want to keep sportsing on the... - "Grizzlies.<eos> "...but if you want me "to show you the money, then...<eos> You gotta finish your career off with the '76ers!"<eos> And it was classic Pete.<eos> It's so nice to remember work as more than just a thing that kept Pete on the phone all the time.<eos> You're very welcome.<eos> Oh, Val, you should have Pete's phone.<eos> All those memories and photos...<eos> It's in the garage with all his stuff.
I don't want it to splatter everywhere!<eos> ♪ And that's why they call it ♪ ♪ The out-of-peanuts ♪<eos> ♪ Blues... ♪ ♪ Stadium taco. ♪<eos> Thank you guys for being a bright spot on my sad day.<eos> Aah! - Shucks!<eos> - Sorry!<eos> I thought I saw Pete's ghost! It was a paint can.<eos> We gotta find this phone.<eos> And get the hell out of here.<eos> Okay, it's ringing.
I'm already Asian.<eos> [indistinct chatter] Wow, this brings me back.<eos> I had a seat at the popular table, the Debate Team table, the Student Council table, and the Waiting For Marriage table.<eos> But that table kind of fell apart when everybody got pregnant but me.<eos> I ate in the school parking lot with a wino.<eos> He was so nice to me, I thought he might be my dad.<eos> But then he never made a move on me, so I guess he wasn't.<eos> (Kemberly) Attention everyone, attention.<eos> Yeah, attention everyone, attention.<eos> Ashlin and I are here today to sell our T-shirts and to talk about bullying and how it's not cool.

The hell? It just... vanished.<eos> I'm pretty sure I just committed at least three felonies.<eos> And I've seen Shawshank.<eos> I know what they do to guys like me in the big house.<eos> D Block prom queen.<eos> - That's it? It's gone?<eos> - It's still there. I hacked the icon and changed its color so it blends in with the background of the ATC monitor.<eos> Basically, I made it disappear. Sudie.<eos> That's Lithuanian for "sayonara," which is Japanese for "good-bye."<eos> That plane will be effectively invisible when it lands at your private airstrip.
Tommy?<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> One of your runaway kids, destined to run no more.<eos> It's Cameron's.<eos> So, I guess we get a giant can opener and start checking trunks.<eos> Or maybe not.<eos> If you're gonna kill Cameron and leave him in the trunk of a car to be demolished, and see he has a phone, you don't leave it here and on.<eos> You'd know we'd find him.<eos> Maybe they didn't know he had the phone.<eos> Then how does it get inside the tire?
Not since he dropped off those coolers of brains at my place.<eos> Why? It doesn't look like he came home last night.<eos> I'm really worried about him, Liv.<eos> I am too.<eos> Any word from Peyton?<eos> Uh, sadly, no.<eos> I'll reach out to Major.<eos> I'm so sick of this life, Ravi.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> It's not much longer now.
I'll be there, okay?<eos> Unless we can show that he's Tyson, we have to release him.<eos> He wanted to be here, and so did she.<eos> Why? Aah!<eos> Beckett.<eos> It's done.<eos> You sure this is where she said she was going?<eos> Yeah, yeah... 9th and Jane.<eos> Tory said she still can't get a trace on Beckett's phone.<eos> Says it's either been turned off or disabled.
I wanted to protect her.<eos> You said she showed up three weeks ago when stuff from her home arrived?<eos> Yes. Part of a shipment from a monastery in Tivoli.<eos> Her family's treasures found their way to the Church.<eos> As with many of the great houses of Europe.<eos> You get that she got here, just before the murders started happening.<eos> I finally realized that.<eos> And then I heard the two of you, and it made me wonder.<eos> That's when I read her journal.<eos> It was given to her father right after her death.
Mm. That shit drives me wild.<eos> Well... it ain't French, but, uh... I got a little something for ya.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Look at that shit.<eos> Like that's... fucked up shit.<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> It's inked in blood.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Try this piece of poetry.<eos> It'll blow your mind.
Carson?<eos> Hey, don't.<eos> Don't shoot me.<eos> I'm your friend.<eos> I need you.<eos> You need me?<eos> I need you... to die.<eos> Ah yeah, hi.<eos> Uh, I came in there many years ago, and, uh, we chatted about a particular book.<eos> It was, uh, bound in human flesh, inked in blood.
Man, I always thought it was the mezcal talking, but after seeing this, I think he was right.<eos> I'ma tell you something I've never told anyone.<eos> 30 years ago my friends and I spent the night at a cabin.<eos> We found a book.<eos> Necronomicon Ex-Mortis...<eos> The Book of the Dead.<eos> Certain passages were recited.<eos> It awoke something in the woods.<eos> Something dark... evil.<eos> It got into my hand and it went bad, so I lopped it off at the wrist.

Are you kidding?<eos> He can't help with anything.<eos> Relax, sweetheart.<eos> I'm not sticking my neck out for anybody.<eos> In fact, I'm just about to haul nuggies.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm outta here.<eos> What is that?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Well, whatever this thing is, it's found you.
It's hard work too!<eos> Thank you for being so generous to me.<eos> I hear you excelled at the Paris Conservatory.<eos> I'm working with a group of young composers.<eos> We try new things, new kinds of music.<eos> I'd love to invite you.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> Your guests, the photo.<eos> The photo, yes.<eos> It means a lot to them.
Let's not get sentimental.<eos> No sentiment! It's size that counts!<eos> And now, song time!<eos> Has your husband seen you dancing like a gypsy?<eos> He thinks I'm rehearsing!<eos> It's nice to see you looking better.<eos> Did you work well?<eos> That red scarf, is it silk?<eos> I saw you this evening.<eos> It was a farewell gift.
Even when it explains nothing!<eos> It's today's paper.<eos> She's giving a recital tonight.<eos> It's the break she's been waiting for.<eos> She's going to be a great artist.<eos> Maybe I didn't feel worthy of her.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Isn't suffering interesting?<eos> It's good!<eos> It's part of life.

At school.<eos> - I said zero.<eos> - No.<eos> He's totally lost me.<eos> How many drops-<eos> - How many?<eos> - Yes.<eos> How many drops can you put in an empty glass?<eos> Just one.<eos> After that, it's not empty.
It's got nothing to do with that.<eos> We talked on the phone, we reached an agreement, we got in our car, we drove over.<eos> So did we, we saw it.<eos> 6,300.<eos> We sit down, draw up the papers, I sign the check, problem solved.<eos> You sell, we buy, everybody's happy. End of story.<eos> You know, I'm not here to beg.<eos> We like our mobile home.<eos> Our reasons for selling are personal.<eos> It's lower than market price because we need to sell.

It has sentimental value.<eos> I'm sure you have lots of happy memories here but, seriously, it's worth 6,300 tops.
How's your head?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> This doesn't look like my seatbelt.<eos> All set?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Great meal.<eos> Um, I-I think there must be a mistake.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - The... The tip is too big.<eos> - Well, how much is it?

Great meal.<eos> Um, I-I think there must be a mistake.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - The... The tip is too big.<eos> - Well, how much is it?<eos> It's $50,000.<eos> Let me see that.<eos> Oh. I see what I did.<eos> It's not a tip.<eos> It's an offer.
Thanks for coming, everybody.<eos> I really appreciate your time.<eos> So, what did you think of the book?<eos> Of Mice and Men, it's Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck's classic American novel.<eos> It was published in 1937 to wide critical acclaim.

I was just leaving.<eos> I caught wind of this teacher case, Cher.<eos> I need you to be extra careful with this one.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm always careful.<eos> It's not like you to question that.<eos> I'm sorry, Cher, but I just happen to be on the board of the United Teaching Fellows.<eos> These people-- they do God's work for inner-city communities.<eos> If word gets out that it's too dangerous, the whole program could suffer.<eos> No, the kids that it could help-- well, that just makes me mad, all right?
Should we finish with this knife?<eos> So, Hodgins found trace of a synthetic lubricant in the wound.<eos> Lubricants are used on switchblades and other folding knives.<eos> So if we change the handle to a folding knife... we have our weapon.<eos> So, we tested your knife, Keith.<eos> We found blood in the liner.<eos> Okay, I cut myself.<eos> - So what?<eos> - It's not your blood type.<eos> It's B positive, like Mia Ferrara's.

And after eight years, it makes no sense.<eos> He took you under his wing from the start.<eos> He made you his closest collaborator, his right hand even, when we know he doesn't trust people easily.<eos> That means something. How do you explain it?<eos> He's singled me out, that's all.<eos> Exactly.<eos> During your job interview, what did you both say?<eos> I did all the talking.<eos> He asked the questions.<eos> OK, but how did it go?
My name's Élisabeth. What's yours?<eos> Mathilde.<eos> Which department do you work in?<eos> Marketing, for now.<eos> - Been here long?<eos> - Yes. Eight years.<eos> I've been here two months.<eos> - And do you like it?<eos> - I love it.<eos> It's exactly the job I wanted.
I've been here two months.<eos> - And do you like it?<eos> - I love it.<eos> It's exactly the job I wanted.<eos> Have you tried the gym classes?<eos> Yes. I used to go to the sports centre on avenue Leclerc.<eos> But I don't go any more.<eos> And is the pool at the aquatic centre good?<eos> The pool... Yes.<eos> It's a 25-metre pool.

Just promise me you'll pick something practical.<eos> Right.<eos> Right. Practical.<eos> Got to think practical.<eos> Hey, um, if you had the right kind of saddle, could you ride a giant panda?<eos> ♪ Men. ♪<eos> Don't peek. I want it to be a surprise.<eos> Please don't be a panda.<eos> Please don't be a panda.<eos> It's not a panda.
Can I uncover my eyes?<eos> Uh, ooh, one second.<eos> Is he getting naked?<eos> If he was, I'd be covering my eyes.<eos> Okay, open your eyes.<eos> Wow.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think he should've gotten the penis enlargement.<eos> This thing must have cost a fortune.<eos> Oh, it's not as expensive as you think.
All hands.<eos> We need all hands.<eos> They're surly.<eos> I repeat, the Bobbys are surly.<eos> If I find a way out, then what?<eos> Thegateis behind door number... 42.<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> Welcome to the party.<eos> The prison, it's, uh -- it's close.
Father... Your baby's home.<eos> We're going to need more water.<eos> You must use your fork.<eos> You act as though raised by wolves.<eos> I suppose in some ways you were.<eos> You hold the fork like this, and you use the knife to push the food onto the prongs.<eos> First, the cloth.<eos> You place it in your lap like so.<eos> What do you hide there?<eos> Come, now, show me what it is.
Very advanced words for a stern puritan mistress like yourself.<eos> See, I would have thought you'd consider the body a constant source of pain and temptation to hell, like your husband.<eos> My husband is entirely correct.<eos> Life with him has been both a pain and a constant temptation to hell.<eos> But I'm not convinced God intended it so.<eos> Your friend Isaac improves, and with him, the chance to save many.<eos> Now, the blood I drew from him could be used to guard the unaffected.<eos> You would spread his infectious blood.<eos> Curious.<eos> But if it helps others, that is indeed good news.
I seek the materiality of the soul...<eos> Its embodiment, and, likewise, the soul that lives in all things.<eos> If we can understand the physical seat of the soul, and we understand the spiritual nature of all things, then we might learn to do so much.<eos> You sound like a witch.<eos> Well, perhaps so.<eos> Perhaps, in their own misbegotten way, witches are scientists.<eos> Well, then Hathorne would be right, and scientists are also witches.<eos> But I do not seek to hurt anyone.<eos> I am searching for the very organ that proves God's existence within us.<eos> And where is it?

The crossroads between body and mind.
Did you feel it?<eos> What?<eos> Your soul on the verge of leaving your body.<eos> Did your vision begin to darken?<eos> Your pulse quickened, and rapid thoughts, like... Like pictures flitting past your mind's eye.<eos> Yes.<eos> What on earth were you thinking? Well, I wasn't.<eos> Thinking, that is.<eos> But tell me... How did it feel to be completely in another's control over your very life, your very soul?<eos> I know such a feeling, and this was not it.
We need to go now, sir.<eos> Negative! Not an option!<eos> There! There! There!<eos> Walter!<eos> Put him down. Put him down.<eos> It's okay, buddy.<eos> Toby, he's lost a lot of blood.<eos> All right, let's move out!<eos> Sounds like they're getting a handle on the fire.<eos> Should have it contained by nightfall.
Hey. Even Tiger Woods needs a swing coach.<eos> Listen, can you just come back in, like, what, 20 minutes?<eos> This can't wait. Look at this text.<eos> Okay, that can't be for you.<eos> You never pay for anything.<eos> I think, somehow, some way... Charlie is still alive.<eos> Okay, this is ridiculous.<eos> There's more.<eos> A package came addressed to him.<eos> Oh, is it something that vibrates?
Okay, that can't be for you.<eos> You never pay for anything.<eos> I think, somehow, some way... Charlie is still alive.<eos> Okay, this is ridiculous.<eos> There's more.<eos> A package came addressed to him.<eos> Oh, is it something that vibrates?<eos> 'Cause I could really use some help with this.<eos> He ain't lying.<eos> It's-it's-it's not sex toys.
Really?<eos> Who else would call me "a horrible mother"?<eos> No, no, it's still ridiculous.<eos> What's ridiculous?<eos> Alan has this crazy idea that Charlie's still alive.<eos> But then who sent her that e-mail?<eos> Who sent me this text?<eos> Where did the cigars, booze and chasing' knife come from?<eos> Wait, what's a chasing' knife?<eos> Uh, it's a regular knife after two bottles of scotch and some blow.
Sinan.<eos> When did I become a hysterical girl in search of a husband?<eos> The thing that hurts most about making a mistake... Is being aware of making it.<eos> Oh, love.<eos> You're sweet and short.<eos> She was now alone with a terrific sense of melancholy.<eos> She was a stranger to her own body to her home of years, to everyone around her whose voice she'd heard and face she'd seen daily.<eos> A deafening voice was crying out far away.<eos> This time it was too late.<eos> When happiness was near she'd failed to grasp it... And endless bliss now eluded her forever.
Zhang?<eos> You guys, did Zhang circle back through here?<eos> No. She stormed off that way, didn't she?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh. You don't think... yeah, I do...<eos> O'Donnell's boxing gym.<eos> - She's going after Hicks.<eos> - I-I'll get her.<eos> She's my responsibility.<eos> If you're looking for the pilates studio, it's across the street.
Hypothetically?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fine. Hypothetically.<eos> Let's say... and this is just an example... that he wanted half a kilo of coke.<eos> Why would Henry need cocaine?<eos> Let's just assume, in this particular example, that he said he was trying to help a friend get out of a bad situation.<eos> Who was the friend, and what were they gonna do with the coke?<eos> Maybe he didn't say, and I didn't ask.<eos> Maybe I told him he shouldn't get back in the game.<eos> It's too dangerous.

Could he have ordered Henry's execution while detained?<eos> Uh, he made one phone call...<eos> to his lawyer.<eos> And he didn't manage to get through until Henry was already dead.<eos> Yo, Beckett, we were combing through Wadlow's business dealings, and we came across something that might be connected to our case.<eos> Over the past six months, Wadlow's been buying up real estate for his next new development in Chinatown, and each time he did, he outbid the same rival company.<eos> VCN Holdings...<eos> and the woman who runs VCN also happens to own a little restaurant called the Jade Temple.<eos> Mimi Tan is behind this?<eos> That's right... it's one of dozens of businesses she owns, and not all of them are on the up-and-up.
I just need to get it close to her laptop, which I'll do tonight at dinner.<eos> Harold...<eos> It can only transmit a tiny amount of data.<eos> Maybe a few megs.<eos> But it's data from Samaritan's core heuristics.<eos> It-- it's DNA.<eos> You may be able to find a way to cripple it.<eos> The program can only be used once.<eos> Our enemy will trace the data stream and try to destroy whoever is wielding the device.<eos> But it could make a difference in this war.
Now, with text deposit, you can manage your accounts from literally anywhere.<eos> You can bank on it.<eos> You can bank on us-- Sequoia Liberty.<eos> Okay, yes, they do sound similar.<eos> They're the same song.<eos> Someone stole my song and turned it into a jingle.<eos> You said you never played this at a show?<eos> I have a little studio space in Alphabet City.<eos> I do everything there.<eos> But it's soundproofed.
That's why Harvey's so slow to care about anybody.<eos> Forstman used somebody he cared about.<eos> Holy shit. I never even thought about that.<eos> Who do you think it was?<eos> I don't know, but I have a pretty good guess.<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> I think this place is a dump, and I'm busy, so why don't you tell me why we're here?<eos> I want to open a restaurant here.<eos> Marcus, there's already a restaurant here.<eos> And it isn't working.
A lot of you don't know this, but the truth is, I hated Norma.<eos> I hated her clogs, her mustache, her stupid seasonal sweaters.<eos> But the thing I hated most about her was her favorite story about how Abe Vigoda asked her to marry him in 1975.<eos> I mean, we get it.<eos> You were hot.<eos> You turned him down, and it was the biggest regret of your life.<eos> And like everything you ever said, I couldn't stand it at the time.<eos> But now that you're gone,<eos> Don't let the moment pass.<eos> Don't let the people you love walk by you without letting them know how you feel about them, because life slips by, and then it's over.
Call me!<eos> - Are you OK, Mum?<eos> - You sound funny.<eos> I'm putting Eric on.<eos> Eric, it's Gran.<eos> OK. - Hello, Gran?<eos> - Yes, little wolf.<eos> Thanks for the present.<eos> - You like it? - Yes.<eos> - Is it your size?
Do you have something you'd like to add?<eos> Amen.<eos> I call upon these persons here present...<eos> Actually, I would like to say something, as maid of honour, just now if that's...?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's actually a short song but I think it's very fitting.<eos> ♪ When my bonny love did falter ♪ As the river laps the bank ♪ His furtive tongue did loosen for<eos> ♪ His eye did gaze upon our place<eos> ♪ A love safe fine yet clear<eos> ♪ I see your wheel turn fit, my dear ♪ It pleasures me somewhere
Councilwoman-- do you think you could help me get some traction with these people?<eos> Oh, funnily enough, I have a charity event tomorrow with other high-powered L.A. women.<eos> I'll put a word in with Yowtz.<eos> Martha Yowtz?<eos> Yeah. The lioness of Los Angeles education?<eos> Yes.<eos> The straw that stirs the school board's drink?<eos> That's right. That is a woman I'd like to get to know.<eos> Is there any way I could come with you to this event?<eos> Ah, you know, it's really a networking thing.
Write a six and let's go.<eos> They should start putting GPS in golf balls, am I right?<eos> We already got lapped by Sue Kim from the Korean Women's League, and she's 100.<eos> Jess, she is literally 100 years old.<eos> And I'm... I'll tell you what-- not a young 100.<eos> Martha doesn't strike me as the type of person who gives computers to cheaters.<eos> You really don't understand how networking works.<eos> The computers are just the thing you talk about when you're really talking about how to help each other become more powerful.<eos> Just like the money for this golf thing-- it doesn't go to charity.<eos> It just pays for the event where we network.
And as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs.<eos> As a vet, I'm sure you know that a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor.<eos> So let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out.<eos> - It's time to save a life! - Geez.<eos> [ Grunts, sighs]<eos> That's odd.<eos> This deer's wounded.<eos> Uh, yeah, I was there.<eos> You don't have to rub it in.<eos> I mean it's been shot with a gun.
Wait, wait.<eos> Think about getting in the cupboards, but don't really.<eos> Is this what you want, you sick fuck? !<eos> You want to see children die?<eos> ! You son of a bitch.<eos> You don't stop living until I say so!<eos> - Michael.<eos> - Who's this now?<eos> - My lawyer.<eos> I'm here to notify you, ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property regardless of how far it runs or who intercepts it before it dies.
Genetically hard-wired to keep on living, whatever happens.<eos> Well... But they still age, poor loves.<eos> Over time, the body breaks down, rots, liquefies.<eos> Interestingly, the Dalek word for sewer is the same as their word...<eos> .. for graveyard.<eos> Ask me what I want.<eos> Irrelevant.<eos> You will not prevail.<eos> You will not succeed.<eos> I've been at the heart of your empire for 42 minutes, and I own it ... and I haven't even got out of my chair.
I hope you are grateful.<eos> It wasn't easy to procure.<eos> And very nearly unique, of course.<eos> You should feel privileged.<eos> The only other chair on Skaro.<eos> Don't get up.<eos> You neither.<eos> The chamber is sealed.<eos> And I believe you are not carrying your sonic device.<eos> Gave it up.
I'm just a bloke in a box, telling stories.<eos> I didn't come here because I'm ashamed.<eos> A bit of shame never hurt anyone.<eos> I came... .. because you're sick and you asked.<eos> And because sometimes, on a good day... .. if I try very hard...<eos> .. I'm not some old Time Lord who ran away.<eos> I'm the Doctor.<eos> Compassion then.<eos> Always.<eos> It grows strong and fierce in you ...

Looks like your girlfriend took your bike.<eos> I tried to get her to stop, but she wouldn't listen to me.<eos> Yeah, I know it's not a very "PC" thing to say these days, but, uh, chicks are like that.<eos> It's just a fact.<eos> Well, I'm shoving' off to take care of the book.<eos> Catch you on the flip-flop.<eos> Umm, about the book... she took it.<eos> She took it?<eos> Uh, yeah, she-she grabbed it on her way out,<eos> I guess she thinks it's gonna help her with her mom.
Look, we have a bad soundproofing problem<eos> Between apartments.<eos> The wall is hollow. We hear every sound.<eos> Oh?<eos> And forget the management.<eos> It's not the same building. Nor the same district.<eos> We're stuck together by an architectural anomaly.<eos> So I got fed up, and I came up with this system.<eos> But it's absurd.<eos> Well, it's worked like a charm until now.
Go on.<eos> Serge Lama, 1968.<eos> D'aventures en Aventures.<eos> Magnificent.<eos> But from affair to affair,<eos> From train to train, from port to port,<eos> I swear to you again, I'll never forget your body.<eos> Turn off the light, I'm beat.<eos> I haven't finished my crossword.<eos> I'm struggling. It's level 4!
OK.<eos> My wife was an architect.<eos> We did this motel together.<eos> That's why...<eos> OK.<eos> "After a final interview "during which you ask the member "if they are completely sure of voluntary termination,<eos> "administer the member a tablet of Domperidone "20 minutes before the dose of Pentobarbital. "Once they're ready,<eos> "prepare and administer euthanasia "with the greatest respect and calm possible."<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> It's not easy.
It's a vanitas.<eos> - It isn't a skull?<eos> - It is. - It's also called a "vanitas."<eos> - Ah, OK. It took me months to spot it.<eos> What were you doing on all fours?<eos> - Where's your gadget?<eos> - Out of batteries.<eos> - No comment.<eos> - But you're thinking it.<eos> It's gone.
- I didn't know about it, but others did.<eos> And you learned your husband was a spy from Reddington?<eos> Sort of.<eos> I had to find out for myself.<eos> And when you found out, what did you do?<eos> I spied on him.<eos> Interrogated the people in his life to find out who he worked for.<eos> - Not before he realized that I knew.<eos> How did that conversation go?<eos> - It was heated.
Gabrielle's calling.<eos> Who never needs to hear about this garbage.<eos> Got it? Got it.<eos> His beard, it was auburn colored.<eos> And he had this cowboy hat with a wide brim.<eos> I'm pretty sure there was a scar over his eye.<eos> There's an 81% chance Vance Ford is lying about his role in Jim Sullivan's murder.<eos> You taped our meeting?<eos> No. What you've just heard is a recording of the second of three interviews that the police conducted with Mr. Ford.<eos> It only sounds like our meeting today because he hewed so closely to his original description.
My lords, ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce to you my dear friend, the saviour of English magic, the magician of Hanover Square, Mr Norr-ell!<eos> He has disappeared.<eos> Can I help you, sir?<eos> The rain shall make a door for me.<eos> And I shall walk through it.<eos> Oh, yes, you think yourself a very fine fella.<eos> Hoarding books like a miser hoards gold.<eos> - Open up!<eos> - Well, I have a book, sir. A book you won't find in your library, or any other.<eos> It's written by the Raven King, and it tells me all about you.
Pure light.<eos> The perfection of it all.<eos> Even in me.<eos> Then I got lost.<eos> Kept trying to climb higher. Get closer to that light.<eos> Like an endless ladder where all you do is get further and further away.<eos> There's a part of you that wants to get lost, am I right?<eos> Climb that ladder.<eos> Tell me about your very last drunk.<eos> What kind of day was it?
Okay.<eos> It's not a bomb.<eos> I mean, we can take it outside and detonate it if you want to be safe, but you might want to take a look first.<eos> Thanks, Ted.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Let's run this down to the crime lab.<eos> Packaging, everything.<eos> Let's run this blood, too.<eos> And see if it matches any of our victims.
Are you familiar with my Black Closet?<eos> Yes.<eos> There are places in my murder palace that have sat in cold neglect for far too long.<eos> You can put them to good use, old boy.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Good.<eos> - Now... - My God, look at this.<eos> The whole floor needs to be torn out.<eos> This space is perfect for my atelier.<eos> It's gonna be sensational.
It was a tectonic shift where everything I thought I knew about myself got rearranged.<eos> It was like I finally fell in love for real.<eos> All the cracks and missing pieces came together.<eos> I felt whole.<eos> I'd found my soul mate.<eos> I couldn't stop smelling his head.<eos> It made me feel drowsy and giddy, like we were in the middle of a lavender field in the south of France.<eos> The smell was real.<eos> He truly smelled like fresh lavender.<eos> It was and always will be my drug of choice.
How the hell should I know?<eos> Why are you wasting your time on junkies?<eos> We only hurt ourselves.<eos> It's not like breaking one of the Ten Commandments.<eos> What did you say?<eos> What?<eos> Didn't you go to Sunday school?<eos> How about "Thou shalt not kill"?<eos> Well, that commandment is always translated wrong.<eos> It should be "Thou shalt not commit murder."
Room service.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can you leave it outside?<eos> I just got out of the shower.<eos> I'll bring you the tip later.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Get out.<eos> Get out of my room!<eos> This isn't what it looks like!
She'd be dead.<eos> All right, my dear, I want you to breathe in and count backwards.<eos> There you are.<eos> Shh... Very good.<eos> There you are.<eos> Get me the big knife.<eos> Ready the pan.<eos> Closing her up.<eos> Nurse, dispose of that.<eos> I think it's still alive.

This is no place for children.<eos> Come on, let's go find the kids.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> You find them, 'cause it sounds like you know what to do.<eos> But even with that done, she'll still have one little reason to go on, and I'm gonna tend to that.<eos> So give me the key to room 33.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can you show us to the line to the "Fast Furious Supercharged"?<eos> We are lost in this hotel for so long.<eos> It's like a maze.
I've got a surprise for you.<eos> I left his door open and the dish out, so it's possible he may just crawl back in there.<eos> He can't have gotten far.<eos> We need to find him before the Countess gets back, or there'll be hell to pay.<eos> You want some more ice for that?<eos> Mmm.<eos> Mmm, naw. It'll be all healed up in an hour.<eos> Did you find it?<eos> It's being taken care of.<eos> That thing should've died way back when it was supposed to.
! Look at us!<eos> "The Great Lover,"<eos> that magnificent face that women lusted after, killed themselves over, reduced to a grotesque monstrosity.<eos> Our lives stolen!<eos> Everything gone.<eos> You are right. Forgive me, amore.<eos> I was foolish.<eos> I promise, we will reclaim all that we have lost.<eos> - You will see.<eos> Our life will be far more glorious than it ever was before.
And when I need you, I'll let you know.<eos> Hey, hello?<eos> Can somebody call the police?<eos> No. No, no!<eos> We are hot shit, buddy.<eos> I can't believe you're marrying a girl.<eos> I'm gonna be blunt.<eos> Your father is bisexual.<eos> People think that word means something dirty, but it doesn't.<eos> It means I like men and I like women, equally.
Around ten, I would say.<eos> What room is he in?<eos> He checked out this morning.<eos> You're confused, John.<eos> I worked the Gamboa case with you.<eos> He wasn't a pedophile.<eos> But that wasn't Gamboa's only sin.<eos> I saw your ad on Craigslist.<eos> You have the money?<eos> There it is.
But you used it tonight.<eos> You took your pain, and you made the world a cleaner place.<eos> That's a decidedly positive first step.<eos> I'd like to show you something.<eos> Behold. The unfinished work of James Patrick March.<eos> This was to be my crowning achievement, my Hamlet.<eos> Well, really more of a sonnet when you compare it to my earlier work.<eos> What I really loved about this project was its simplicity of statement.<eos> The elegance of a round number... ten.<eos> Which makes it even more vexing I was never able to complete it.
Tell me.<eos> COUNTESS: Apackof wildchildren drained a man of all his blood.<eos> Anything you want to tell me, Alex?<eos> Isavedmy patient.<eos> Maxwasdyingfrommeasles. Soyouturnedhim ...<eos> andheturnedthe others.<eos> One chance to fix this problem.<eos> Countess told me she'd kill me and Holden if I didn't make things right.<eos> I know it's not your problem...<eos> If it involves you and Holden, it's my problem.
I get night terrors.<eos> Actual night terrors?<eos> Parasomnia?<eos> I usually don't remember them.<eos> Usually?<eos> Was there one night you do remember?<eos> My dad found me on the floor, lying beside the chair.<eos> - What about the skylight?<eos> - That's the thing.<eos> It doesn't actually open.

I'm meant to be here.<eos> I'm meant to be part of this pack.<eos> I think it's pretty secure now.<eos> Look, I've got to meet a client at the courthouse.<eos> Okay? But I'll be back soon.<eos> I won't let anything happen to you.<eos> Find anything?<eos> Nope.<eos> I fell in a hole.<eos> It was the bridge where his sister died, wasn't it?
And yourself?<eos> My objections are scientific not religious.<eos> But why your interest?<eos> Can you tell me more?<eos> I am afraid not but my thanks, all the same.<eos> And for what you tried to do for the girl.<eos> Well, then, perhaps you'll allow me to examine your hand.<eos> How long have you been taking mercury?<eos> Almost a week now.<eos> It brings hallucinations, as you know.
Surely your employers would take issue with your affiliation to an activist group which sometimes espouses an anticapitalist agenda.<eos> What's your point?<eos> Do you think that I'm lying?<eos> Well, in my experience, investment bankers are very good at concealing untruths.<eos> You already know that I post to the boards.<eos> You can tell my boss if you want.<eos> If I was with Petros, why not just admit it?<eos> CSU just finished processing<eos> Petros Franken's car. They found some blood in the trunk.<eos> Looks like it's a match for the victim.
Enjoy.<eos> There must be thousands of pages here.<eos> 26 boxes, approximately 4,000 sheets a box-- that's roughly 104,000 sheets.<eos> The search will be exceedingly tedious;<eos> but one must, from time to time, outwork criminals as well as outthink them.<eos> : All right, we may as well get started.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be dining with your bachelorette planning committee tonight?<eos> No, I told them I was busy.<eos> Your behavior has been troublingly incongruous of late.<eos> Has it?
Was it as simple as a philosophical gap?<eos> You must've been friends at some point.<eos> You shared the Species handle.<eos> Did you meet to discuss your differences in person?<eos> You're not very good in person, are you?<eos> Maybe he intimidated you, got physical, so you grabbed the sword.<eos> Where were you on Thursday night?<eos> Uh, I-I was... on-online, video chatting with my girlfriend;<eos> she's from Manitoba. What did you do with the Japanese short sword?<eos> Is it in your apartment, hidden under the mattress perhaps?
'Private journal of Captain Jonathan Moran, '21st November 2119.<eos> 'We have located a craft of unknown origin on the lake floor.<eos> 'Visual scans in situ revealed nothing, 'so we have brought the craft on board 'and myself and the crew will now investigate.'<eos> How did they miss this in the initial survey?<eos> Cass says it was buried, and the currents of the water must have shifted the rubble around.

Whoa, whoa.<eos> What's this?<eos> Lunn, grab me a torch, will you?<eos> It was found on MOD property, even if that property is underwater.
Yes, we're coming back.<eos> Tell them we're abandoning the base on my orders.<eos> Topside, Topside, this is Lance Corporal Alice O'Donnell from Drum Control.<eos> 'Drum Control, this is Topside.<eos> 'We have received your message.<eos> Submarine on its way.<eos> Over.'<eos> Repeat, Topside. Over.<eos> 'We've received your request for a rescue sub.<eos> 'It's two minutes away.
You go to this cement factory.<eos> Prepare our exit.<eos> Here.<eos> Oh, good boy.<eos> All right. He didn't get any of his stupid on you, did he?<eos> End of humanity is upon us, and all you care about is your dog?<eos> Yeah, well, he's the, uh, key to my heart.<eos> Kyle...<eos> Kyle, can we get some water?<eos> It's, uh, Jim's heart.
He needs water.<eos> My heart?<eos> Yeah, good thing he doesn't know you don't have one.<eos> Well, who needs a heart... when you got a brain?<eos> Here goes.<eos> "Ground control to Major Tom."<eos> I don't understand.<eos> No signal, radio or otherwise, can get in and out of the dome.<eos> Exactly, that's why I'm jacking up the transmitter's signal.<eos> When it can't get outside the dome, it'll start bouncing off the walls, back and forth, uh, building in strength, kind of like an A.M. radio signal, bouncing off the ionosphere when it cools down at night.
Blunt-force trauma to the back of the head.<eos> Probably a pipe or a baseball bat.<eos> Based on lividity, I'd say it happened between 12:00 and 2:00 a.m. this morning.<eos> Any witnesses?<eos> A guy who lives nearby heard screams around 1:00 a.m.<eos> He looked out his window.<eos> He saw a car speeding away.<eos> He get a make and model?<eos> Just taillights.<eos> But he said it looked like a sports car.
All right, so, here is the parking lot behind St. Simon's.<eos> There's Richie.<eos> Now watch this.<eos> It's a sports car... like the one seen fleeing the crime scene.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And apparently, the driver had some kind of beef with Pitbull.<eos> He shoves him in the car and drives off.<eos> Can we make out the plate? Yeah.<eos> Already ran it.<eos> It is registered to this guy...
NYPD!<eos> Let me see your hands... now!<eos> Where is it, Mike?<eos> Where's the body?<eos> What's going on? What are you talking about?<eos> Search his place.<eos> Espo, pop the trunk.<eos> Hands on the car.<eos> All right.<eos> It's here.
Don't know if you can hear me, but please know, wherever you are, I am so sorry for the pain we've caused each other.<eos> I want you to live.<eos> Please, please live.<eos> That's a good look for you.<eos> You going somewhere?<eos> Yes, thank goodness, and leaving this rat trap behind.<eos> I've rented a townhouse not far from here, and it's rather grand.<eos> A grand townhouse?<eos> How did you get the money?<eos> The business is growing, Leith, and it will grow even more once I give it the right setting.
And I'll risk a lash to convince you.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, stop.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Okay, we do have a murder.<eos> - Right.<eos> So I was combing over the victim's clothing, and I found several blonde hairs.<eos> Also there's traces of vaginal fluid transferred onto his underwear.<eos> Oh, okay, well, Dad's not gonna be happy about that.<eos> - What about the phone?<eos> - It was repaired.
Say... to a newspaper?<eos> My guess is, the FBI would immediately revoke the agent's top secret clearance, possibly even make an example out of him and fire him.<eos> You do realize that you're talking about blackmail.<eos> No, I'm talking hypotheticals.<eos> But when you think about it, $30,000 really isn't that much.<eos> Not when you consider the alternatives.<eos> Dr. Brennan, this blunt force trauma injury to the left temporal bone is unlike any I've ever seen.<eos> Yes.<eos> Angela already ran the fracture pattern through the computer.<eos> It doesn't correspond to any commonly known blunt force weapons.
No, no, I-I'm fine.<eos> I just got to get someplace safe.<eos> These guys are still after me.<eos> What guys?<eos> Some southern-fried D-bags.<eos> They've been after me since I-I dug up "The Book of the Damned."<eos> You found it? Where?<eos> After some near misses and some broken-into museums,<eos> I found historical documents that led to a monastery in Spain.<eos> It burned down years ago, left for dead, but, uh, I had this hunch about it.
Where are you right now?<eos> Uh, just south of Des Moines.<eos> Uh, okay, you know what?<eos> Our -- our friend Bobby has a whole bunch of cabins scattered all around, places for hunters to crash.<eos> You know, it's not much, but there's some gear and lore books, stuff to keep you busy till we get there.<eos> Okay, bring snacks. And every Men of Letters decoder ring there is.<eos> This book is old and scary, and I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Hey, check it out.<eos> I found this in the storage room.<eos> It's lead-lined and warded.
Were you followed?<eos> No, no.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Um... I may have just passed out, but better.<eos> Where's the book?<eos> Okay, here's what I've learned so far.<eos> About 700 years ago, a nun locked herself away after having "Visions of Darkness."<eos> After a few decades squirrelled away by herself, she emerged with this.<eos> Each page is made out of slices of her own skin written in her blood.<eos> I told you, it's eekish.

Oh, just a cupid.<eos> Just an angry, angry cupid.<eos> I understand you're upset.<eos> You both corrupted heaven.<eos> It's never gonna be the same!<eos> I owed you that one, anyway.<eos> This changes nothing.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Okay, I got a pretty good look at his tattoo.<eos> It's something like this.
You got this.<eos> He's right.<eos> You know what, Charlie?<eos> Why, uh...<eos> Um, why don't we stick with my notes for a little bit?<eos> This book is literally making my eyes hurt.<eos> What is it?<eos> Damn it.<eos> She found a way to hide the book.<eos> It was here.

Y'all hid the book, didn't you?<eos> Lead-lined little number, I'm betting.<eos> I don't know what the hell you're talking about. You don't?<eos> See that?<eos> That man back there, well, he said the same thing as all the others at truck stops and gas stations up and down the way.<eos> Nobody had seen that redheaded girl.<eos> And then a man bearing that Mark comes in here, to me.<eos> Well, there's coincidence, and then there's just Providence.<eos> See, "The Book of the Damned," it wants to be found.<eos> It wants to come home.
-Dad's speakers are better.<eos> -Tough luck.<eos> I need the laundry started.<eos> The workmen have left for the day, and I have my hands full with dinner.<eos> And please, none of your Betty Fredan stuff.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> I always get stuck with the chores just because I'm the girl.<eos> Yeah, well, tough luck.<eos> The house is great, Ted.<eos> It's a bit of a fixer, but it's a real beaut.

Just do the best you can.<eos> Frankensteins aren't real.<eos> They're made up.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> And we never had a family acquaintance named Mary Shelley who spent a few nights in castle Frankenstein and stumbled upon our secrets, and forced us to change our name and go underground.<eos> So, why didn't Shelley go public?<eos> She wrote a book.<eos> Doesn't get more public than that.<eos> Mm.<eos> But no one believed it to be true, just like no one's gonna believe you.
Were you here when I mentioned that we're underground?<eos> There are secrets.<eos> Well, I'm swell at uncovering secrets.<eos> You give me the book, and it's conceivable that we could have a conversation.<eos> The book?<eos> Mm.<eos> Dude, we don't have the book.<eos> The book was burned.<eos> The book is protected by a spell.<eos> It's eternal.

And then I thought -- and this is key --<eos> I thought, "this is bad, but it would really blow if these guys had the book.<eos> At least they don't have the damn book."<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> At least the damn book burned.<eos> Right, Sam?<eos> But then, Eldon Frankenstein -- he hits me with this little fun fact.<eos> He says that the book can't be destroyed.<eos> Says that it can't be sliced, diced, shredded, burned, drowned.
Give them the code -- whatever they want!<eos> Charlie, I don't know what the hell is going on, but you need to listen to me.<eos> Give whoever that is whatever they want.<eos> You understand?<eos> Charlie?<eos> !<eos> I can't do that, Dean.<eos> So, you had the book the whole time?<eos> Dean -- lied right to my face.<eos> I thought it was our only chance to get you free of the Mark, so I grabbed it.
What evil?<eos> The Darkness.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Well, what does it sound like?<eos> Does it sound like a good thing?<eos> Even if I remove Dean from the playing field, we're still left with you, loyal, dogged Sam, who I suspect will never rest until he sets his brother free -- will never rest until his brother is free of the Mark,<eos> which simply cannot happen, lest the Darkness be set free.<eos> Then there was that time you stood me up.<eos> You traded my life.<eos> I'm willing to live with this thing forever, as long as I know that I and it will never hurt another living thing.
Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> What does the book do?<eos> It triggers the memory centers of the brain.
You know, it's just one long language trick.<eos> That's why I can't read it?<eos> It's affecting the fox part of you.<eos> Confusing it.<eos> I swear that wasn't me.<eos> You forgot to sign it.<eos> Are you going to tell me why you're dropping?<eos> It's a schedule thing.<eos> Why did you take this class to begin with?<eos> Isn't it a prerequisite for the college you want?
It's $25.<eos> Liam, please stop.<eos> I promised I'd pay you back.<eos> It doesn't matter now.<eos> And Phil takes half of it anyway.<eos> I know it's for your medication so please just take the money.<eos> No, it wasn't your fault.<eos> I punched you in the face.<eos> I meant the shots.<eos> It's for mycophenolate.
What were you thinking the moment you knew he was dead and there was no saving him?<eos> One word...<eos> Good.<eos> What?<eos> A scent.<eos> Like smoke.<eos> Like something burning.<eos> You okay?<eos> Better than ever.<eos> It healed.
Stilinski's calling everyone in.<eos> There's another body.<eos> You mean another murder.<eos> Somebody get these cuffs off of her.<eos> If she was actually involved, it was self-defense.<eos> That's correct, Sheriff.<eos> Dad... Don't say anything.<eos> The sword is mine.<eos> Really? No, it's not.<eos> It's mine.
That's all they said.<eos> First, you forget.<eos> You don't know who you are or what you're doing.<eos> Then you get violent.<eos> I watched two of them almost kill each other.<eos> One of them had a nasty looking cut just like that.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Black is okay.<eos> It's only really over when you start bleeding other stuff.<eos> When it starts turning silver...
Someone is trying to make supernatural creatures with non-supernatural means.<eos> It's only really over when it starts turning silver...<eos> That's when they know you're really a failure.<eos> Kira, I don't want you to leave.<eos> And I don't want to hurt anyone.<eos> Something's changed.<eos> And I think it's because of me.<eos> And I don't know how to fix it.<eos> My asthma is back.<eos> I'm not sure how, but it came back.

If Stilinski knew the truth, he'd definitely get in his way.<eos> So Lydia and Stiles are trying to find the bodies, which means finding the Nemeton.<eos> They're driving around, searching all of the woods.<eos> But the last time that we found this thing, three of us had almost drowned in ice water.<eos> We're not the only ones looking for Chimeras...<eos> Stilinski's got everyone looking for the next target.<eos> Questioning anyone who's a genetic Chimera.<eos> Anyone who's got two sets of DNA.<eos> No one really knows what they're looking for.<eos> Some think it's a serial killer.
I promise.<eos> They're here.<eos> She's getting worse.<eos> If she's a real werewolf, we can save her. You gotta give her the bite.<eos> No.<eos> What do you mean, "No"?<eos> Liam, look at her.<eos> She's too weak.<eos> It will kill her. We don't even know what the mercury's doing to her.<eos> We don't even know if it is actually mercury.
You've done more since you started than most of our best covert units do in a lifetime.<eos> We'd do worse than we did today to protect it. ♪ but I'm gonna be here until I'm nothing ♪<eos> And hey.<eos> Now I have something to hold over your head.<eos> Just kidding, buddy.<eos> You have a good night.<eos> The paperwork is complete.<eos> The account has been established for Mr. Ames' daughter.<eos> You sure you want to do this? Yes.<eos> And the scholarship, it's... anonymous, correct?
If proof of your plan gets back to Francis, we might both lose our heads, whether Francis wants it or not.<eos> Surprise.<eos> Oh.<eos> It's you.<eos> You were expecting someone else?<eos> If your mother knew you were in my bed, she would not be happy.<eos> A fact of which you, Claude... are well aware.<eos> Does this technique typically work for you?<eos> Pursuing a man who has already politely declined?<eos> Of course it does.
They're also hubs for espionage.<eos> We did our best to appear inconspicuous, but to a trained eye, a royal operative is easily made.<eos> I think Ridley was killed deliberately.<eos> That there were spies amongst us that night.<eos> Then I need you to find out who they answer to:<eos> England, France, or someone else.<eos> Yes, Lord Condé.<eos> I hear you're leaving us.<eos> What business do you have in the north?<eos> It's a neglected part of your realm.
- I begged you for discretion.<eos> - I'm sorry, Francis.<eos> And now I am lying for you, lying even to my brother, protecting you as you take comfort in the arms of another.<eos> This is not what I wanted.<eos> - I only wanted to find...<eos> - Happiness.<eos> I know.<eos> Your happiness.<eos> But I don't know how much longer I can maintain this charade.<eos> I made you a promise, and it's one I won't break.
Francis' death.<eos> It's all coming true!<eos> What exactly did he see?<eos> I can't lose him.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'll be alone!<eos> Charles, Henry, they're too young to rule.<eos> I'll be regent.<eos> I... I... I'm not ready!<eos> The country, it's too weak.
Welcome.<eos> Last night Police Commissioner Hans Pettersson was abducted.<eos> We have received a video of Hans and a demand for ransom money.<eos> We want to hear from people who have been in the garage by Vidungegatan 5 last night around 7:00 and may have noticed something.<eos> We'll keep you updated but we ask that you show respect for both us and Hans Pettersson's loved ones.<eos> - How large is the ransom?<eos> - We won't disclose that.<eos> - Do you have any suspects?<eos> - Have the police received threats?<eos> He would give us money, but it was gone.
Dad died this morning.<eos> Now it's only you and me, Saga.<eos> We're having a memorial service.<eos> I hope you'll at least come to that.<eos> You haven't always hated him.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Helle Anker's car has been found.<eos> Shut up, man.<eos> It's a heart.<eos> - Do you think it's Helle Anker's?
Saga, it's me.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're here now?<eos> Yes. You may have missed something.<eos> In the mouths of the victims.<eos> - Henrik Sabroe, Copenhagen Police.<eos> - I'm working on the last victim.<eos> - Latest.<eos> The latest victim.<eos> We don't know if it's the last.
- What were the workers doing here?<eos> - You know why.<eos> - I don't know why.<eos> - I want another color.<eos> - Right after she moved in?<eos> - Yes, we've talked about it.<eos> He shouldn't be in there. What does she have to do with the color?<eos> - I thought it was boring.<eos> - So my choice was boring.<eos> Yeah, it was fucking boring, Å sa.
- You know why.<eos> - I don't know why.<eos> - I want another color.<eos> - Right after she moved in?<eos> - Yes, we've talked about it.<eos> He shouldn't be in there. What does she have to do with the color?<eos> - I thought it was boring.<eos> - So my choice was boring.<eos> Yeah, it was fucking boring, Å sa.<eos> It was unimaginative.
- John, what's happening?<eos> Anything new? - The signal isn't moving.<eos> The Danish police are on the way.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - We came too late.<eos> - I understood that.<eos> - It turned onto Njalsgade.<eos> - What are we looking for?<eos> A computer, ipad, or cell phone.<eos> We don't know which, but it's moving.
- Just get her out of here.<eos> - I can't kick her out.<eos> Because she's the mother of your child, isn't she?<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> - Hi, Honey.<eos> - Say we really did it. - Did what?<eos> - The child.<eos> Of course we did it.<eos> I don't know if they're going to be good parents for my child.<eos> It's not your child, Jeanette.
- I can't kick her out.<eos> Because she's the mother of your child, isn't she?<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> - Hi, Honey.<eos> - Say we really did it. - Did what?<eos> - The child.<eos> Of course we did it.<eos> I don't know if they're going to be good parents for my child.<eos> It's not your child, Jeanette.<eos> - It's more mine than hers.
We continue the surveillance anyway.<eos> He'd built an exact copy of the room in the cellar.<eos> - How does the room in Ystad look now?<eos> - We've removed the barricade. If it means so much to him, that could be where he is.<eos> I had a painting in my room.<eos> A copy of an amateur painting by a Danish artist who was rightfully forgotten.<eos> But that painting was the only beautiful thing in my life.<eos> You think I'm exaggerating.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> I used to fantasize about how it would be in there.
The wash basin... another brand.<eos> They're similar, but not identical.<eos> But the painting there is exactly the same.<eos> The car that Rasmus saw was reported stolen yesterday morning in Lomma.<eos> - There's no trace?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - What is that? - A painting.<eos> - Yes, I see that.<eos> - It's from the foster home where Emil lived.<eos> Find out who the artist is, what it's called, and if it depicts a place that exists.
Global de-evolution, extinction events.<eos> Catastrophic.<eos> Devastating.<eos> What if, prior to any of these events, the animals knew what was coming?<eos> Though we may be too ignorant, too unwilling to recognize it, we can even ignore the... the defiant pupil.<eos> Denial is...<eos> What does your father mean, Jackson?<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Of course you are, little man.<eos> It's gibberish.
My name's Jackson.<eos> Chloe.<eos> Chloe. Okay.<eos> Can you tell me what happened, Chloe?<eos> We were out...<eos> We were looking for animals.<eos> There were perhaps 15 of us.<eos> There was a Japanese couple and a group of Russian tourists.<eos> And... and the guide... he... he... he wanted us to... to go see some gazelles, and so we got off the car, we got closer to-to the gazelles, and... and... and then I... I heard a noise.<eos> I looked back and... it was the bus driver.
Yes, thanks.<eos> What is this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The house below, that is burned out, it was Mr. Costa's.<eos> He committed suicide just before the flood.<eos> Do you think there's a link?<eos> For a long time, this hamlet was called "the hand of God".<eos> Did you know?<eos> No.<eos> Since it's on the heights, those who lived here were saved from the flood when the dam broke.
Anyway... today I went across the street to the Apple Store, and I got one of the new iPhones with the 64-gigabytes, 'cause I wasn't sure if I should get the 16s or the 64s, but the 64s look good, so there you go.<eos> The genius bartender showed me how to make things bigger, but I already forgot.<eos> God, my eyesight is so shot.<eos> But I got on Google before, and I looked up my apartment, and it said they'd filmed The Hills there for two seasons.
I'd spend on her on, like, giving us a special day, so...<eos> But what about Dani, is he working?<eos> Oh, she.<eos> Yeah, she's a chef at Bouchon, but she's, like, fifth in line and works crazy hours.<eos> She does.<eos> What if I gave you the money?<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, I can gift a certain amount of money every year to a person without having to pay taxes, and I...<eos> I don't know if it's gonna be enough for your dream wedding, but $13,000...
She does.<eos> What if I gave you the money?<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, I can gift a certain amount of money every year to a person without having to pay taxes, and I...<eos> I don't know if it's gonna be enough for your dream wedding, but $13,000...<eos> - Marnie, that's crazy.<eos> - No. What's crazy?<eos> I have it, you need it.<eos> I mean, you just don't want to leave it sitting around.
- It's crazy, yeah.<eos> Can't remember when I had that much fun.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You know?<eos> - It was nice.<eos> - Couple of Brooklynites, we are.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> And that dress is... it's... just a knockout!<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's actually my daughter's.
Where's Eliza?<eos> She couldn't make it.<eos> I'm disappointed.<eos> Won't last long.<eos> I'm sorry. Your friends aren't coming, but mine are.<eos> Where do I find Eliza?<eos> Forget it.<eos> I'm not helping you.<eos> I'm positive you're supposed to call her after I'm dead, which means her number's in your phone.<eos> It's highly encrypted.
I'm positive you're supposed to call her after I'm dead, which means her number's in your phone.<eos> It's highly encrypted.<eos> There's no way you'll be able to hack it.<eos> Yeah. Let me worry about that.<eos> Have you traced the phone to our friend yet?<eos> In process.<eos> So to find your guy, I need to log on to the web portal.<eos> And here we go.<eos> I was right.<eos> It was accessed by a second computer. Stationary.
Fine.<eos> I just came in here to give you this.<eos> You mean...<eos> Today is the day I work for you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can't believe it. This is really happening?<eos> What do we do first?<eos> I mean, I'm so goddamn turned on right now.<eos> I don't know. Maybe we could get a jump on some of the things that have been piling up since Norma.<eos> Well, my Dictaphone's at full capacity, it's about to burst.
Never a truer word spoken!<eos> Yes.<eos> - I'll sponsor your project, professor.<eos> - I'm not with you.<eos> I'll invest the necessary sum in your animal shelter project.<eos> Ms. Sultan, how do you know about it?<eos> You've thrown me.<eos> Let's not get lost in details.<eos> My one condition is that the shelter be named after my grandfather.<eos> It'll be the Abdüssekkür Pasha Animal Shelter.
The woman sponsored an animal shelter.<eos> I have to accept her invitation.<eos> Don't snap.<eos> I didn't say anything bad.<eos> You're a man worthy of sultans.<eos> Good grief, jokes all the way.<eos> This wit of yours.<eos> Dr. Niyazi.<eos> May your book be blessed.<eos> May it bring good fortune.
God, God, God!<eos> Why are you beating the car?<eos> You know what "süveyda" is, Süleyman?<eos> "Süveyda"?<eos> Right in the middle of the heart... There's said to be a tiny, jet black dot.<eos> A mini chest where certain feelings and sins...<eos> Are locked away.<eos> Like the core of the heart.<eos> As love has escaped me... My heart has shrunk so small...<eos> That I feel like it's crashing around inside that pitch-black chest.
I'm sure he has a plan.<eos> Why don't you ask him?<eos> Maybe I'll do that.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's over at Frick and Frack's house.<eos> They asked him to help fix their broken generator.<eos> Oldest trick in the book.<eos> Maybe I ought to go lend a hand on fixing that generator.<eos> Yeah, I can't find anything wrong with this thing.<eos> It seems to be working just fine.
This is Tandy Land, and he knows it.<eos> He smells the spray, he's trying to tip-toe through it.<eos> But it's all over his feet and legs.<eos> Poor guy.<eos> Mmm, Phil.<eos> Oh, there you go, you big camper.<eos> Oh, now put the food in the bear box.<eos> The food's in the box, baby.<eos> Put it high up in the tree so the bears can't get to it.<eos> It's in the tree, it's high up there.

I don't see it here.<eos> You said it was a vehicle tracker?<eos> I'm... I'm sorry, but, uh, it's not listed here.<eos> You're gonna have to come down. No.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm... I'm... I'm looking around everywhere.<eos> I don't see them. You said aisle 5, right? No.<eos> Aisle 3.<eos> Memory's not what it used to be.
It is far too dangerous.<eos> I did fear I made a mistake returning here to the scene of all my crimes.<eos> But now I know this is where I am meant to be.<eos> And that is?<eos> The Malum, the cause of the plague that decimates Salem even now.<eos> And proof I was right.<eos> If only my father had listened to me.<eos> If he believed me, we might have stopped the grand rite and he might yet live.<eos> And this... thing shows you your purpose here how?<eos> It reminds me that I am here to undo all my father's errors.
The last of the Founding Fathers must rise up and protect our good name.<eos> I'm depending on you, George, to show Salem that you are still a giant among men.<eos> Oh!<eos> I didn't see you there.<eos> I need to see Mrs. Sibley.<eos> I was told to wait in here.<eos> And who are you?<eos> My name is Anne. I...<eos> Your hair...<eos> Yes. ... It looks like fire and smells of cinnamon.

- In what way?<eos> - Firstly by apologising.<eos> When we met the other day, I spoke slightingly of your conscience.<eos> - I can assure you, my lady...<eos> - Please, Mr Marlott, I... I sense... you are an honest man who seeks to do God's work.<eos> That's why I've come, because... I believe you are in peril.<eos> - Peril?<eos> - To your soul.<eos> You know what Sir Robert's legislation entails?<eos> It aims to put the body-snatchers out of business by assigning the unclaimed bodies of the poor to the anatomy schools.
A punishment formerly reserved for murderers.<eos> Denying them their last hope of redemption on Judgement Day.<eos> No holy burial, no body intact.<eos> No resurrection.<eos> See, if we deny Christ to the poor, Mister Marlott, don't we also deny him to ourselves?<eos> And that's what is stake here.<eos> Not merely the future of medicine. But the prospect of a world without God.<eos> The surgeons would argue that the act is to the benefit of us all.<eos> Isn't that what they always say, Mr Marlott? When it is the wealthy who are to profit.<eos> This act seeks not only to supplant the body-snatchers, it will also outlaw all forms of medicine not licensed directly by the surgeons, benign, philanthropic practices such as Lord Hervey's.
You seriously fucked up my day, son.<eos> You took my money, and you left me with Mateo Perez. You dumb shit.<eos> We could have been partners on this. Goddamn!<eos> I didn't think I'd see you again.<eos> Well, next time you better kill me all the way.<eos> Well, next time, I'll remember that.<eos> Don't strain yourself.<eos> I could give two shits about the trouble you got yourself into. - Or why you killed the kid! - Kid?<eos> All I care about is the goddamn money!<eos> Now where the fuck is it? !

Elia:<eos> I was eating breakfast, and it hit me.<eos> Isn't that much different than the engine in the ferrari.<eos> Air and fuel intake results in a propulsion of the piston heads...<eos> That is, in theory, what I'm doing with my propulsion chamber.<eos> How cute-- they're finishing each other's sentences.<eos> Thought you should<eos> Drive it around for a little bit, get a feel for what you're building On a smaller scale-- but not that much smaller.<eos> You're giving him a half-million-dollar car To help him with his science project?<eos> It's just a loaner. Though...
I'm gonna try to override the system.<eos> The hacker's cut off his oxygen. Sylvester:<eos> She can't override the system. We're helpless.<eos> Come on!<eos> Sarah...<eos> He can't breathe. Turn it off.<eos> Cabe!<eos> Turn it off!<eos> Jim, no, hang on, okay?<eos> It's not working!
And that is what's beside the vent, unless you're 17 feet down from the vent opening facing north, Where there is a crawl space.<eos> Okay, I put you about 15 feet down.<eos> And, uh, north is toward me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I need a hand free to operate the torch.<eos> Come on, come on, come on.<eos> Oh. Walter.<eos> (grunting) Walter, I'm headed towards oblivion.<eos> When you get to my foot, grab hold And I'll pull you up into the hole when it's cut. (grunts)
He released the sarin.<eos> Now I'm gonna take him outside And kill this man on live tv!<eos> Move! Okay.<eos> Uh, guys, the gas<eos> Is in zone 5, which means you have less than five minutes To get out of the building.<eos> Sarah, we have to go.<eos> I can't leave him. There's nothing you<eos> Can do for him.<eos> Simon's released the gas.<eos> If it's coming through the ventilation system, It kicks on zone by zone,

What zone goes first?<eos> 5 down to 1.<eos> Sarah:<eos> Only about a minute per zone.<eos> Tops!<eos> (speaks indistinctly)<eos> By the time walter and simon are outside, I want sharpshooters on the bluff across the street And the rooftop on the other side of the parking lot.<eos> Merrick: No way.<eos> I'm three minutes away from bugging everyone out For a mile radius of here.<eos> The incinerator's vent has a hole that you made. So once the gas is released into zone 1, It can escape from the vents and kill all of us.
He's trying to save the city.<eos> Oh, uh, sly, walter fixed the server hub.<eos> You shut down the incinerator now!<eos> I have spent my life since the bombing raids Trying to atone for the deaths.<eos> I will not rest until I have saved At least that number that have died.<eos> Please do not add any more lives to that list.<eos> It's already too late.<eos> The incinerator is shut off.<eos> But I can't see ralph. He's off the surveillance grid.<eos> Once the gas is released into zone 1, how long before It escapes through the incinerator hole?
That still doesn't get you the Mother Cell.<eos> Wait, what if I went with you? - Just me.<eos> - Jamie, forget about...<eos> One of you guys punched him in the face, and the other one's a cop.<eos> I would understand...<eos> That would be entirely acceptable.<eos> - It would?<eos> - Entirely.<eos> We'll take my boat.<eos> Vet says it'll cost $3,000.
- How old are you, 28?<eos> - 27.<eos> 27. What the hell you doing here, Joe Blake?<eos> I want my country back, sir.<eos> You want it back?<eos> You never had it.<eos> Sir?<eos> You were still sucking your thumb when they dropped the bomb.<eos> This shit hole's the only country you've ever known.<eos> Well, my father told me what it was like, before the war.
They marched my poor John to his death, and now his own daughter thinks they're the good guys.<eos> Exercise is good for her, Anne, after the accident and all.<eos> Your father's spinning in his grave, I tell you that.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Go? You just got here.<eos> - Frank's waiting.<eos> - I'll get your coat.<eos> All righty, Glen.<eos> Is your game something you trained for in Hitler youth?<eos> Yes, it certainly is, Phil.
No. It was just hard to get a word in, that's all.<eos> Ohh. Much better.<eos> I highly recommend it.<eos> I'm good. Thank you.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Because I can give you a hand if you want.<eos> I said I'm good.<eos> I heard you.<eos> You know what else I hear?<eos> Your heart, and it's racing.
Probably at the movies.<eos> Yeah, or--or mini golf.<eos> I need ketchup.<eos> So are we gonna talk about it?<eos> - What?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> You're gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you.<eos> I know about the cure, Elena.<eos> You do?<eos> How is it even possible?
No, no. You made your feelings for me perfectly clear when you had to spin a web of lies to snap my humanity back on.<eos> I don't know what Enzo told you, but I assure you I'm fine.<eos> You know, Enzo told me a lot of things, including that after losing all hope of getting your friends back you went off the deep end last night.<eos> A momentary lapse.<eos> I mean, I figured since you passed the ripper gene on to me-- thank you for that, by the way-- we could talk about it.<eos> There's nothing to talk about. You know<eos> Personally when I start feeling like I'm gonna go over the edge, I begin to salivate in the back of my mouth.<eos> Does that ever happen to you?<eos> And then my veins, they begin to itch uncontrollably, and the hunger consumes me-- every sound, every scent.<eos> The world around me falls apart, and all I can hear is the pulsing of someone's blood, and all I feel is that it belongs to me.
Remember, I'm on injured reserve, so you'll have to fill me in.<eos> Deputy Taylor finally stopped calling me cupcake.<eos> I guess that's progress.<eos> Maybe that's because Deputy Taylor's on medical leave for a week after you kicked his ass in front of the trainees.<eos> Yeah? Well, you know what?<eos> He had it coming.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Are you that incapable of not raging out?<eos> This program was a chance for you to do something with your life.<eos> No. That's what it is for you
Elena, hey.<eos> You scared the crap out of me.<eos> I think I'm--I'm ok.<eos> What happened?<eos> We were on our first date.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Damon!<eos> Damon--I'm getting- - I'm getting my memories back.<eos> Damon, the cure, it undid the compulsion.

No, because then I thought, "what would a human do?"<eos> So I called 911, got her to the hospital, and then I let the doctors do their job, and it felt oddly empowering.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Tell you what?<eos> How amazing it feels to be human again.<eos> At first, I was worried that it might take the edge off my senses, but it's the opposite.<eos> I feel... Connected to the world again. I feel...<eos> Alive?<eos> Yeah. That's because your life has purpose again.<eos> It's finite, and it's... Pretty much the greatest feeling in the whole world.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> The cure to vampirism.<eos> You're gonna take the cure, Elena, and I'm gonna take it with you.<eos> - It's not healing.

I heard the Queen Mother herself depended on his counsel.<eos> With him gone, the court is in need of a new seer.<eos> Me?<eos> At court?<eos> You wouldn't have to hide who you are<eos> - or what you do.<eos> - I doubt the court ladies would welcome me into their embroidery group.<eos> You don't need them.<eos> You'd have me.<eos> At least visit the castle, and see if it's a place where you could be happy.
But thanks to Elizabeth's gold and support, he has the armies of hundreds of French Protestant lords at his command.<eos> They started arriving in the last hour.<eos> And more all the time.<eos> My watchman puts Condé's forces at 900, maybe 1,000 men.<eos> There's still a chance for us to get you beyond the castle walls<eos> - and to safety.<eos> - It's too late for that.<eos> The fight is upon us, and a king must stand his ground.<eos> The castle's a good stronghold.<eos> It's built to withstand
English queen who does not take kindly to the advice of others.<eos> It also relies on me losing my head.<eos> - There can't be two kings.<eos> - No.<eos> There cannot.<eos> Which is why I reject your offer.<eos> I refuse to surrender.<eos> My reign will not end without a fight.<eos> Doesn't Mary's life mean anything to you?<eos> It means a great deal.
Condé's men are running everywhere.<eos> It's chaos.<eos> Are they forming up for attack?<eos> There's no formation.<eos> They're scattering.<eos> Do you hear the screaming?<eos> Francis, I never told you this...<eos> I didn't think it was relevant...<eos> but right before she left, Mary gave me a package for Greer.<eos> Said it was very important.
I haven't told a soul.<eos> Delphine has the gift of sight.<eos> She thought I already knew, being the proud father.<eos> How long have you known?<eos> A few days.<eos> A few weeks.<eos> So that's why you got me into bed, so suddenly, so remorseful.<eos> You wanted me to believe the child was mine.<eos> Surely I would take you back.<eos> No, I wanted it to be yours.
More secrets?<eos> Is that what we really need?<eos> I don't understand how you can justify it, in your heart, in your soul, these<eos> - Ruling requires that your hands be drenched in blood.<eos> You... who have led so many to their destruction, know it.<eos> And Francis, who killed his own father, knows it.<eos> You are no better than me, either one of you.<eos> And I am sick to death of you pretending otherwise!<eos> The difference between us is this.<eos> For us, bloodshed is a gruesome last resort, but for you... for you, it is as easy as drawing your next breath.
Aah!<eos> My lord, are you unwell?<eos> I feel like I'm on fire.<eos> Get back, witch!<eos> She's getting away!<eos> Get her!<eos> I will love you for the rest of my life.<eos> And I will never let you go again.<eos> I hope she's pregnant soon.<eos> A child is vital, and it will help protect her in France as well.
You're leaving town?<eos> Do you know what happens inside a cocoon?<eos> That fuzzy little caterpillar liquefies.<eos> And when it comes out, it's something else.<eos> Those people, they're, uh, they're not the same.<eos> Well, of course they're not.<eos> Think about what they've been through.<eos> No, I mean they're not the same.<eos> They've changed.<eos> Junior, he-he burned down the house, and whistled while it blazed, all dead behind the eyes.
At least I respected Big Jim.<eos> Only thing I like about Christine is watching her walk away.<eos> We don't make deals.<eos> It's simple.<eos> Tell us about the egg, or we torture you.<eos> And this... this is a preview.<eos> Wait, wait. Stop.<eos> I know where the egg is.<eos> I stole it.<eos> It's here on Bird Island.
You're gonna take me to the comm station outside.<eos> We're gonna talk to whoever's in charge, and we're gonna make a little trade, your life for my ticket out of this godforsaken dome.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Which way?<eos> Drop the weapon.<eos> I'm walking out of here.<eos> You try to stop me, he dies.<eos> You killed your own man. Yes.<eos> For the egg.<eos> Where is it?
You killed your own man. Yes.<eos> For the egg.<eos> Where is it?<eos> You need me.<eos> If I die, you got no one to tell you where the egg is.<eos> Let him go.<eos> He can't get far.<eos> People eating cattle feed?<eos> I didn't think that was possible.<eos> The feed had to be pulverized and fermented and it tastes disgusting, but it's digestible.
He can't get far.<eos> People eating cattle feed?<eos> I didn't think that was possible.<eos> The feed had to be pulverized and fermented and it tastes disgusting, but it's digestible.<eos> That's a good sign.<eos> All right, there's a window up top here.<eos> Anything?<eos> There's feed!<eos> How much?<eos> Well, it looks like enough to hold us over till the crops start producing.
We need to talk about her.<eos> She's not who she says she is.<eos> - She works for Aktaion. - What?<eos> The badge I found in the caves belongs to Christine.<eos> She admitted it.<eos> She said that she works for Aktaion?<eos> No, she said it was her university I.D... but the logo is Aktaion's.<eos> I mean, maybe.<eos> Or maybe the university logo just looks similar.<eos> It fits perfectly.
Hey, hey.<eos> It's okay, boy.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's okay, boy.<eos> Come here.<eos> You weren't honest with me about the egg, Mr. Rennie.<eos> The egg is not on Bird Island.<eos> Wait!<eos> I lied.<eos> It's at Town Hall.
Wait!<eos> I lied.<eos> It's at Town Hall.<eos> Christine's got it.<eos> You've lost your chance.<eos> Martin, take this animal into the next room and slaughter it.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> Wait.<eos> All right.<eos> It's smashed.
It's at Town Hall.<eos> Christine's got it.<eos> You've lost your chance.<eos> Martin, take this animal into the next room and slaughter it.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> Wait.<eos> All right.<eos> It's smashed.<eos> I broke it.<eos> It's broken.

Mr. Rennie, we are only hours away from isolating the inhuman properties in her blood. - The effect that that has when injected into an uninfected host is of great interest.<eos> However, if you're successful in getting us the information we want, you'll be spared that future.<eos> The choice is yours.<eos> Where do you want me to start?<eos> How about the beginning?<eos> Christine and I work for Aktaion.<eos> We were told we could help the world.<eos> So they hired us to find fragments of meteors from a shower that hit the earth 25 years ago.<eos> When Melanie found the egg.<eos> It was in one of the meteors.
Come on.<eos> - Come on.<eos> All right, Junior, why don't you run up ahead?<eos> Get the boat ready.<eos> Sure.<eos> So, we have a conversation that we need to finish.<eos> I believe the outstanding question was... who are you?<eos> I worked for Aktaion and was tasked with finding the egg.<eos> And what did Aktaion tell you the egg was?<eos> They said it had the potential to be the next great energy source.
The situation is more complex than I let on.<eos> Yesterday, Sam stabbed me.<eos> I only survived because James found me and brought me to the tunnels.<eos> Well, you want me to track Sam down?<eos> Oh, he's already in custody.<eos> I need you to spearhead the mining operation.<eos> So why do we need these amethysts?<eos> They power the dome.<eos> Like batteries.<eos> The egg kept them charged, but when it was destroyed, the amethysts began to lose their energy.
Stay here.<eos> I'll check it out first.<eos> Good work bringing Joe back.<eos> When he took him to the funeral home, he said he thought the schematic was a way to bring the dome down with sound waves or something.<eos> That's why Christine wanted him.<eos> We need Joe to start working immediately. I don't see him cooperating.<eos> We have ways.<eos> Tell the others Norrie is not to be killed.<eos> Leverage?<eos> If we need it.
I'll tell you, I have $1,000 that, uh,<eos> Barbie's back at town hall making more babies with Eva.<eos> She's still alive?<eos> What happened to plan B?<eos> Didn't work out.<eos> Hell.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> I got to go meet Barbie.<eos> Joe's a double agent.<eos> And all we have to do is stay alive until he builds Christine's device, assuming it works.
Four weeks ago, an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world.<eos> The dome has tested our limits, forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons... rage... grief... fear.<eos> My God.<eos> Now, in order to survive, we must battle our most dangerous adversary... the enemy within.<eos> You saved me from becoming one of them.<eos> I knew the real you was still in there.<eos> The dome's surface is calcifying, unless I can bring down the dome with Joe's help.<eos> I have to stay and build this device.<eos> It's the only way out of here.
Norrie and I just saw her.<eos> She looks almost full-term.<eos> And I'm pretty sure 12 girls just died to make it the world's shortest pregnancy.<eos> Well, then, we got to kill her.<eos> We got to put her down before that thing comes out.<eos> Why is that your solution to everything?<eos> Killing the problem.<eos> I'm sure you like stepping on spiders too.<eos> Well, if the spider has a queen baby inside that's gonna wipe out the entire human race, that kind of spider, yeah, I think I'd kill it.<eos> This cure of yours, you really think it'll work?
- I mean, it's got to detect a... - Okay, Joe, Joe.<eos> Slow down.<eos> I need to know how soon until this thing is working.<eos> I don't know, I-I have a couple big problems to figure out.<eos> Uh, a day or two?<eos> I need you to stall.<eos> What?<eos> No, I-I thought the dome needed to come down before we choked to death.<eos> It-it does, but the Resistance is working on a cure.<eos> We have to see if it'll work before your device does.
What does that even mean?<eos> I think you should have Hunter show you the video.<eos> I'd like to know what video you're referring to.<eos> I'm sure you would, but I'm asking the questions now.<eos> So before you stick this in Junior, why don't you tell us what really happened to your good friend Patrick.<eos> The only reason I kept Patrick's condition a secret was for Lily's sake.<eos> I didn't want to hurt her. Condition?<eos> He turned into something else, something other.<eos> A kind of energy infused with consciousness, but it wasn't his.<eos> It was their consciousness.

I know.<eos> The reason why the government wants us dead is in those files.<eos> If the truth got out about what's really under this dome, there'd be a situation that they couldn't control.<eos> Easier to bury the evidence and hide the bodies.<eos> That's why we can't ever leave, Lily.<eos> This information about my father, it changes everything.<eos> Especially if the cure works.<eos> - Lily...<eos> - Shut up and listen to me.<eos> Say it works, and you save all these people.
Well... don't thank me yet.<eos> Why?<eos> It worked.<eos> He's himself again.<eos> I actually was gonna ask you if we could lose the restraints.<eos> Jim... the signs look good.<eos> But we have to continue monitoring him for the time being.<eos> All right.<eos> When will the cure be ready for the rest of the town?<eos> When I say it's ready.
Now, in order to survive, we must battle our most dangerous adversary... the enemy within.<eos> Inside Eva is the queen, who will lead our kinship out of the dome.<eos> - Push now!<eos> - No!<eos> That baby is half mine.<eos> She is my queen.<eos> We need to split the amethyst into seven pieces.<eos> If the cure works and Joe figures out how to take down the dome, maybe we can all get out of here the same way we came in.<eos> When will the cure be ready for the rest of the town?<eos> When I say it's ready.
- She is my daughter.<eos> - She's not human.<eos> Look, I know how you feel... No, you don't.<eos> You have no idea how I feel.<eos> You're right.<eos> But I do know what we're up against.<eos> And our next move has to be smart.<eos> When I left the day care, Junior was doing well.<eos> He was back to his old self.<eos> So if Hektor's cure works, it can help your baby.
Look, I made a lot of mistakes at Aktaion.<eos> That's why I came under the dome... make things right.<eos> Hey.<eos> We were afraid you wouldn't find us.<eos> Oh... you have yourself to blame for that.<eos> You drew us a square on the door.<eos> Only reason we knew to look here was because "Paper mill" was next on the list of hideouts.<eos> So, we saw the bodies at the day care.<eos> What happened?<eos> The cure, it made Junior go totally aggro.

So the cure failed.<eos> What happened to the new alien queen?<eos> She landed yet?<eos> My daughter was born yesterday.<eos> Where is she?<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - She's... infected.<eos> Christine's troops found us.<eos> - They took the baby.<eos> - This baby, did it have an umbilical cord?
We just need a fresh sample of the most recent viral strain.<eos> There's some more lab equipment outside.<eos> Can you go bring it in, please?<eos> Dr. Bloom's enthusiasm is misplaced, s I think you know.<eos> Synthesizing a new formula will take months.<eos> And by that time, the virus will have mutated again.<eos> Aluminum phosphide?<eos> It's a grain fumigant.<eos> I brought it in with us to help preserve the cattle feed.<eos> Conveniently, it's extremely toxic.

Something's wrong with the dome, Joe.<eos> I know.<eos> It's calcifying.<eos> Christine said we only have a day before the air supply is cut off.<eos> Are we gonna die?<eos> I will get the dome down before then.<eos> I promise.<eos> How?<eos> The transmitter from the radio station, I can use it to amplify the tones for the device.<eos> It was the last missing piece, but if it works, then...
Go!<eos> Go, I got her.<eos> Are you... crying?<eos> My God, what have I done?<eos> You destroyed this town and everyone in it.<eos> Where's my kid?<eos> Sh-She was in the cocoon.<eos> I put her there, I swear.<eos> What just came out of there, that thing, did it take her?<eos> Where did it go?
Liam missed a very important meeting this morning because of Ophelia.<eos> He could have repaired things but once again your daughter ferreted him away by making herself an alcoholic spectacle.<eos> - And for what?<eos> - Love? He's the future King of England.<eos> Love has nothing to do with it.<eos> Fix it. And what of your son's heart?<eos> Men have reached great heights with wounded hearts.<eos> Can I check Your Majesty's room?<eos> Because of the threats?<eos> It's my bedroom, Mr. Pryce.
- It's fine.<eos> It was good to finally talk to you.<eos> I've wanted to.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Well, actually it's not but I'm glad I did.<eos> I'll see you.<eos> Just me.<eos> Classic or avant garde?<eos> Either way, you'll look stunning in purple.<eos> It's regal. It's elegant. It's...
They asked him the same question, and he tried to bolt out the back door.<eos> They're bringing him down to the station now.<eos> Gordon Meadows, I'm Detective Bell.<eos> This is Mr. Holmes, Ms. Watson.<eos> We've just been informed that you're a registered sex offender.<eos> You were arrested for trading in child pornography in 2008.<eos> We're curious.<eos> What's your affiliation with Galen Barrow?<eos> Why'd you buy that taxi last week?<eos> It was too old to put into use.
They said they wanted $5,000 or they would tell the police what I was doing.<eos> I knew that I would go back to jail, s-so I paid.<eos> Everything was quiet for a while.<eos> Then, a few days ago, I get a new text.<eos> A picture of that poor man, Barrow, with a bunch of instructions.<eos> They were telling me where he would be, when he would be there.<eos> That I had to use a cab.<eos> The cops who came to my house, they have my phone.<eos> Look at it, please.<eos> It's all there.

You said earlier that the man who killed Galen was coerced.<eos> Coerced as in blackmailed?<eos> Because I was blackmailed, too.<eos> Funny, you didn't mention that this morning.<eos> I was trying to protect my marriage.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> And I didn't do the right thing at first.<eos> I'm sorry. Why don't you tell us about the blackmail.<eos> About six months ago, someone started sending pictures of me and Galen outside the apartment.<eos> Then text messages came demanding money, instructions where to leave it.
Me?<eos> But... My... But my cousin was here two dozen years before me.<eos> And it was his arrival that triggered the need for this organization.<eos> We realized we weren't alone in the universe and we might soon be getting more immigrants.<eos> Sure enough, you came along.<eos> And with you, Fort Rozz.<eos> Fort Rozz?<eos> Krypton's maximum security prison.<eos> Banished to the Phantom Zone, same place your ship got stuck.<eos> But just like yours, it didn't stay there.
How do you know him?<eos> From church.<eos> He does odd jobs for me.<eos> I'm helping him get back on his feet.<eos> That's nice of you.<eos> So?<eos> Does it work for you?<eos> Yeah, it's perfect.<eos> Welcome to your new home.<eos> May it always be a shelter from the storm.
Oh, you think it's something, you walking up here, waving money in my face.<eos> All it does is remind me of what you are.<eos> You don't get that, because you never listened.<eos> All you cared about was getting out.<eos> "I'm going to Los Angeles.<eos> I'm going to New York." I wasn't supposed to have dreams?<eos> You wanted me to end up like you, check to check, mad at everything?<eos> I'd rather see you standing here in rags with some self-respect.<eos> I didn't ask you to come, and I don't want your money.<eos> It's not mine.

I wasn't supposed to have dreams?<eos> You wanted me to end up like you, check to check, mad at everything?<eos> I'd rather see you standing here in rags with some self-respect.<eos> I didn't ask you to come, and I don't want your money.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> It's the city's.<eos> Take it for Khalil's sake, then.
Get out.<eos> I was out, remember?<eos> You're the one who brought me back in.<eos> Get out.<eos> Perhaps I haven't made myself clear.<eos> - I came home and Tom was here.<eos> - He's back in your life.<eos> - He is not in my life.<eos> - I understand what it's like to be drawn to something that is unhealthy to a part of yourself that you are afraid of.<eos> But I want you to remember what your life really was with him and imagine all that it could be without him.
- She had an insurance policy.<eos> I kept up with the mortgage and made ends meet.<eos> - Do you still have the policy?<eos> - I never saw the policy.<eos> But I have a letter that came with the check. I'm sure I can find that.<eos> It turns out it's a fake. - What is?<eos> - The entire company.<eos> Minnetonka Bankers Health Life was incorporated in 2006.<eos> In nine years, the only policy it issued was to Cruz's mother.<eos> - It's a shelf corporation.
The one that will make this decision.<eos> You know I lean towards the Director.<eos> - Why should I change that position now?<eos> - Because, Mr. Jasper you strike me as a man who would prefer to pitch rather than catch.<eos> - What the hell have you done?<eos> - Just hear him out.<eos> That's all I ask.<eos> Roger is quite right.<eos> The Director's latest stratagem is hubris.<eos> It has very little to do with me and everything to do with the consolidation of his power.
I don't like it, but at least I know what it is.<eos> It does not include lying to me.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> - You want to know what I'm gonna do?<eos> - No.<eos> - I'm gonna buy a boat.<eos> - A boat?<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> A diving boat.<eos> Gonna run it down to Micronesia, open up a charter business.
I'm not a lawyer. I'm not the DA.<eos> So it's her own fault she was killed because she was weak or scared or stupid?<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> I don't. I am truly sorry, okay?<eos> I know there's nothing I can say to make that any better.<eos> I don't want you to say something.<eos> I want you to do something.<eos> Look, what can I do, Angela?<eos> There is a system in place, okay?<eos> And most of the time it actually works.
No teeth.<eos> Not just the tip, sweetie.<eos> Just the tip, sweetie.<eos> This is for Marla, showhorse.<eos> It's like a switch gets thrown.<eos> It just comes out in a rush.<eos> And what is it that makes you so angry?<eos> Because it just keeps happening.<eos> People are such animals.<eos> Only they're even worse because an animal doesn't relish in the pain it causes.
Please, I need a doctor.<eos> Not for very much longer.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have a... God, I have a family.<eos> Don't you dare try and use that.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm begging you.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry!<eos> Yes, you will be.<eos> You don't deserve the lubricant, but it just won't go in otherwise.
He sold that gym, but he's still a fucking trainer.<eos> Some sleazy place on 17th Street.<eos> They made it sound like you were dangerous.<eos> Come on, look at me.<eos> Compared to Watson, that creature.<eos> But I should have done something.<eos> I should have done something to make things right.<eos> Even if it meant me going to jail for the rest of my life, I should have done something.<eos> But you're not talking about punishment, you're talking about vengeance. Taking the law into your own hands.<eos> I'd rather that than leave it in nobody's, which is where it is now.
Pseudoscience, the paranormal, organized religion-- all the usual bollocks.<eos> He wrote a blog that I rather enjoyed.<eos> Did he believe in crowbars?<eos> 'Cause I'm pretty sure that's what caved his skull in.<eos> You put the time of death at approximately one hour before his car was found.<eos> I'm guessing whoever killed him was hoping that the impact of the train would hide the real cause of death.<eos> It says here you removed a small, conical object from beneath his right eye socket.<eos> After he was struck, he fell forward.<eos> This got wedged under his eye on the way down.<eos> Don't know what it is, yet, but I'm sending it to the lab.
Don't come any closer.<eos> You're not a terrorist at all, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I'm open to the possibility that Garrison Boyd's death was an accident.<eos> He caught you unawares and-and you panicked.<eos> But if you drop that lighter, you will be attempting murder on the 200 or so other people who live in this building.<eos> This... this contraption was at the heart of the drawings on Nadim Al-Haj's walls.<eos> I only had a moment to absorb them before they were engulfed in flames, but it was clear that he never intended to sever the cable that he excavated.<eos> Rather, I think his plan was to splice this device onto it.<eos> You think you can figure out what it does?

Big banks have a offices there to get financial data first, but it's also where a lot of info gets encrypted and after that, it's harder to spy on.<eos> Actually, digging a hole on Long Island - makes a lot of sense.<eos> - So you're saying So you're saying my phone might ring at any minute, telling me this guy works for our government?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Or a foreign one.<eos> Or a corporation.<eos> I mean, who in this day and age does not view information as power?<eos> Hopefully, the device will tell us what information the perp was capturing:<eos> e-mails, trade secrets, credit card numbers...<eos> If we're lucky, we'll even get an IP address where it was being sent.
You should not.<eos> You've expended enough time and effort on Hannah Gregson.<eos> Telling him will only embroil you further and benefit no one.<eos> Well, thanks for not actually saying the words "I told you so."<eos> Well, for the record, I thought she was a subpar investigator.<eos> I'd no idea she was so cunning.<eos> Anyway, I sent Mason home for the night.<eos> Thus far, his tests uphold the dignity of the NYPD.<eos> The stream of zeroes and ones generated by his tests entered one end of the device and emerged a consistent formula seconds later, unchanged.<eos> It is quite literally a box that does nothing.
I gave them the night off. Cinco De Mayo.<eos> Good for morale.<eos> I told them to get a margarita, but stay on call.<eos> Because an attack can happen at any time.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> She just gave me our final destination. She's in Brooklyn.<eos> We're running out of time, Harry.<eos> We can only go just so fast, Ms. Groves.<eos> This thing has eight cylinders.<eos> But I sincerely doubt it can fly.
The Machine's taking care of all of us.<eos> Now we have to return the favor. Harold?<eos> - Harold Admin?<eos> - That would be me. Sweet.<eos> Thought I was gonna have to take these back to the truck.<eos> Sign.<eos> 15 laptops, huh?<eos> Startup?<eos> Trying to avoid a shutdown, actually.<eos> Let's get the ice in before it melts.
Makes me worry about you and for you.<eos> For what is the point of so much work if it affords no pleasure?<eos> I try to focus on the future... And what will be gained by their sacrifice.<eos> Oh, my dear.<eos> What do you think that world will be like?<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> A new breath of freedom... utopia.<eos> Do you even know what that word means?<eos> An ideal world.<eos> It means "no place."
An ideal world.<eos> It means "no place."<eos> Do not be blinded by the light of your dreams, Mary Sibley, for these are not the last but merely the first of the sacrifices it will take to achieve our new world.<eos> There are other cities to conquer, other empires to fell.<eos> And all the while, we must wear our mask of respectability.<eos> Then why have you destroyed my mask and killed George?<eos> To show you who are your true and only friends, to eliminate your false confidence, and to prove that those elders of yours hiding in the woods have less hold over you than I.<eos> But have no fear.<eos> Your secret about George is safe with me, as long as we are allies.<eos> Isn't it exciting?

No mercy or pox.<eos> Oh, Isaac...<eos> What a sweet dream.<eos> One that we don't have to wait for sleep to see true.<eos> Dollie, I've got means.<eos> Your money?<eos> I heard them talk about it in the clinic.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> I earned it.<eos> It's mine.
Help! Help!<eos> Petrus' eyes showed me all, witch killer.<eos> You will kill no witches tonight.<eos> Come, now.<eos> You have my Dollie.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Taking away your shame and giving you back your glory.<eos> Do you not think that this flesh has seen a lifetime of wounds and scars and the ravages of time?<eos> And yet, behold...<eos> It retains its youth.
The separation must be the worst.<eos> I cannot imagine not seeing Michael Vincent every day.<eos> Booth is doing okay.<eos> He knows he's got a gambling problem. He's handling it.<eos> He's worked through this once before.<eos> He can do it again.<eos> These bones are also heavily fractured.<eos> And based on the lack of discoloration on the fracture margins, the injuries are postmortem.<eos> Well, once again, you can thank the red slurry for that.<eos> The weight of the water and the force in which it hit the remains would have been enormous.
Like I said, I haven't seen Micah in years.<eos> That's hard to believe.<eos> Well, it's the truth.<eos> Now, unless you have something to hold me on, I'm gonna get up and walk my big ass out of here.<eos> Have a nice day, fellas.<eos> Hey, Angie.<eos> So, I found this wrapped around the victim's wrist.<eos> I tried to clean it off a bit.<eos> Looks like some kind of symbol on it.<eos> Maybe we can figure out what it signifies.
I love you, Pookie Noodlin.<eos> All right, we should do a global search for the symbol on the bracelet.<eos> Why did you pull your passport out anyway, Angela?<eos> We haven't traveled anywhere together for years.<eos> Well, 'cause I had to get it renewed.<eos> In case we ever actually do want to go to Paris.<eos> Paris.<eos> Yeah. Paris.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Uh, looks like it's the ancient Sanskrit symbol, meaning "warrior."
Hey, are you guys okay?<eos> She's dying.<eos> You mean she's melting.<eos> I mean dying.<eos> It's a catastrophe!<eos> It's a disaster!<eos> It's not a disaster, it's a celebration!<eos> Tonight will go down as the greatest night in the history of the Carlyle Hotel.<eos> Your beautiful food will not die.<eos> It will live forever.
So true.<eos> That is so true.<eos> The energy has been drained from it... completely.<eos> I believe something has happened to Abraham-- something dire.<eos> Now, if something has happened to the Horseman of Death, it means there are dark forces in motion.<eos> First things first.<eos> I need to get you out of here.<eos> So tell me what you tried to smuggle past Customs.<eos> An artifact. One of immeasurable significance.<eos> I believe it holds the key to our future as Witnesses,
It was Sumerian. 4,000 years old.<eos> Roughly translated, it said:<eos> Are you serious, Crane?<eos> Yes, I assure you, I am.<eos> Do you not see-- this tablet...<eos> Let me guess. You think this is an ancient prophecy about our place in the war between good and evil?<eos> Shamans thousands of years ago predicted what was gonna happen to us, and that this Babylonian artifact will hold the key to what we're supposed to do with our lives.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Oh, d... all right, fine-- that<eos> It was Sumerian, not Babylonian. Ah.
There you go.<eos> And the red substance?<eos> Oh, we're still working on the analysis.<eos> Thanks, Dani.<eos> Despite what I'm certain is excellent work on Miss Dani's part, science will only take us so far.<eos> We need to tap into information of a less terrestrial nature.<eos> Welcome back to the archives, Crane.<eos> What happened?<eos> The city sold the building to developers.<eos> It's scheduled for demolition next month.
- Hey.<eos> I'll take care of this, Sister Alicia.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's gonna be real nice having you around, KD.<eos> There's a table in the back room.<eos> What's "100% Wood"?<eos> - What? - Your tattoo.<eos> That's, um... from a long time ago.<eos> Hmm, eh. I got this when I was 16.<eos> It's supposed to symbolize my free spirit.

I really admire people that strike out on their own.<eos> Paul also mentioned something about, um... a cash-flow problem, that Greg was looking to extend a line of credit... again.<eos> Boy, sure hope that works out.<eos> There's nothing I can do until the hearing, but then I promise I'm gonna make sure...<eos> There's not gonna be any public hearing.<eos> You're gonna handle this in a closed-door session.<eos> I do that, people are gonna know that I'm giving you preferential treatment.<eos> I'll open myself up to an ethics review.<eos> That could happen.<eos> Probably won't, but it could.
Don't take it personally.<eos> When I first started at Brooks, I heard him refer to me on multiple occasions as "the exotic one."<eos> Oh, fuck him.<eos> God, these Silicon Valley guys, they like to pretend they're so fucking progressive.<eos> I thought Brooks would at least try to fake it.<eos> It really bothers you, doesn't it, being defined by Pernell?<eos> I love my husband, but... I did not get my ass into Stanford and build my business from scratch so I could be called "the judge's wife."<eos> So is that why you've been making deals behind his back?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> We've been looking into all the companies who snapped up land around the Brooks Innovation site while it was still cheap.
Shit.<eos> That's gotta be it.<eos> That's gotta be the fucking book.<eos> Where is that book?<eos> It's right there.<eos> Jocelyn was flipping out about it too.<eos> She brought it back from her house.<eos> PJ had his... his programs in here, his flash drive.<eos> It's not the same book that's in the video.<eos> It's a different copy.
Tell him how much I love him.<eos> I'd hold him in my arms for as long as I could. Feel him hugging me back.<eos> Okay, but more than a few minutes of that would be weird, right?<eos> So then what? What did you have planned for after those first few minutes?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know. Life would just go back to being normal.<eos> Tell me about normal.<eos> Hmm? What did you and PJ used to do together?<eos> Well... When he was eight,<eos> I got him these walkie-talkies with a Morse code button, and we hung a sheet alongside the bunk bed, pretended it was a submarine.
Sounds great.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hey, Jocelyn.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Thanks for coming in. - Yeah.<eos> Did you... did you find Josh?<eos> No, we didn't.<eos> But we found his car outside of Martinez.<eos> Okay.<eos> It was burned pretty badly.
I'm not gonna give him the satisfaction of watching me give up.<eos> Seriously, if I bounce and I don't die, DNR all the way, man.<eos> Your Honor, we're here to decide what happens to Pernell Harris, Jr.<eos> They've presented their experts. We've presented ours.<eos> They're the parents; she's the wife.<eos> We could debate for years.<eos> Except the man whose fate is in question has spoken with that video.<eos> There's no question that's PJ Harris. There's no question what he is saying.<eos> The question is whether that video is admissible.<eos> And it's not.
I tell everyone, the first 12 weeks, anything can happen, so it's up to you, but...<eos> Yeah. I'll keep it to myself for now.<eos> Classless.<eos> I'm just doing my job.<eos> Harassing a man on the same day he's pulling the plug on his son?<eos> Questioning a murder suspect.<eos> Oh, stop beating that horse. It's dead. No.<eos> Shane Caldwell's dead.<eos> We found vomit on his corpse, ran a DNA test, got a match.<eos> You want to guess who it comes back to?
I know what you're gonna say.<eos> That is improbable.<eos> You'll say you don't believe in writer's block, that you wrote your first novel to impress a girl.<eos> That reading great writers inspires you, and drinking with them inspires you to beat them on the best-seller list.<eos> Okay.<eos> Clearly I need to develop some new material.<eos> But this was supposed to be old-fashioned father-daughter time.<eos> Dad, watching you speak to your cronies isn't exactly father-daughter time.<eos> Besides, I'm not 12. We don't have to be attached at the hip. Okay.<eos> That impending specter of death... it's back.
No, I know what I saw.<eos> He got a bunch of texts, five at least.<eos> Dad?<eos> Could I see you for a second?<eos> Anything?<eos> We checked his luggage.<eos> No gun, no device, nothing that speaks to terrorism.<eos> Look, state can confirm the story about the sick mother, but part of Haddad's story checks out.<eos> Turns out that air marshal Ford had a second phone on the flight.<eos> It was his personal cell.
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated.<eos> We obviously had a situation, but we have it under control.<eos> I'm telling you, this is some kind of mistake.<eos> That gun is not mine.<eos> What was your plan, Marilyn?<eos> Take hostages, try to bring down the plane? Bring down the plane?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about the suit you lost against Oceanic, and the threatening texts you sent from this phone.<eos> That is not my phone.<eos> It was in your purse, paid for with your credit card.
- Well?<eos> Do something then!<eos> OK!<eos> OK...<eos> Erm...<eos> Eyes of Hades, Afterlife, death opens up a gateway...<eos> - We need to close it.<eos> - Yeah, I know, but how?<eos> Sam Swift, he's the conduit.<eos> The amulet, it's still in him.
- Yeah... But it's hard to keep track of all this... stuff.<eos> Keep an eye on him though.<eos> He might be around for a while. Or not. Who can say?<eos> You're still not going to take me with you, are you?<eos> People like us, we go on too long.<eos> We forget what matters.<eos> The last thing we need is each other.<eos> We need the mayflies.<eos> See, the mayflies, they know more than we do.<eos> They know how beautiful and precious life is because it's fleeting.
Hi! Did you miss me?<eos> Be more specific.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Ha-ha(! ) I've got a present for you.<eos> - Why?<eos> Am I ill?<eos> - No.<eos> - Are you ill?<eos> - No. Are you never going to travel with me again, because I said a thing?<eos> - It's not a good present.
We'll let you know.<eos> How did the visit go?<eos> Well, George wants to be a pig farmer when he grows up.<eos> - And Mr Drewe's well?<eos> - He's so proud of his animals.<eos> Was Mrs Drewe there?<eos> You're full of questions.<eos> To be honest, she was quite upset at seeing Marigold again.<eos> I thought it would be a nice gesture, but, perhaps, I was being insensitive.<eos> When a woman loves a child, it must stay with her.
- Why aren't you there now?<eos> - I should be.<eos> I suppose the truth is I've never lived alone and I'm not convinced I'll be much good at it.<eos> Beware of being too good at it.<eos> That's the danger of living alone, it can be very hard to give up.<eos> It's not that I'm ungrateful, I am grateful, I think it's very kind.<eos> But you don't want to accept?<eos> This is a beautiful house and whether we're in the great hall or the drawing room, or wherever, it would all be very splendid.<eos> - So what's the problem?<eos> - It's not us.
Why are you offering me four times what I'm asking for my house?<eos> Your residence has been flagged as a highly desirable property by a number of separate institutions.<eos> What's your institution?<eos> - We're from MIT.<eos> - Good school.<eos> It is, thank you.<eos> We're spearheading a research project and the university is financing the grant.<eos> - To buy my house? - Yes.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because it is anomalous.
No fuel, no flame, no combustion.<eos> A simple electromagnetic field. Technology kept secret for 70 years while the world ran on petroleum.<eos> Oil companies making trillions.<eos> What I'm gonna show you next is the most unbelievable part.<eos> Gravity warp drive-- but how?<eos> Element 115.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> Where are you going with that thing?<eos> I'm a man of medicine, sir.<eos> It's dead.
That's great.<eos> Yeah, uh, Laurie?<eos> It's gonna be an extra 200 here on out, okay?<eos> Why?<eos> Because this is a commercial building and you got people living there.<eos> No, no, sometimes I work late.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, these toilets, they can handle day poops, not night poops.<eos> Okay, look...<eos> I'm writing a book.<eos> It's going really well, but, you know, money's just a little tight right now.
I'm Laurie.<eos> Would you like to join us?<eos> Resurrection?<eos> That's the claim from Australia as witnesses describe a man previously believed dead emerging from a cave in Wanneroo outside the city of Perth.<eos> Walked out covered in mozzie bites, saying he'd just been in a hotel.<eos> The man, identified as David Burton...<eos> I made you a grilled cheese.<eos> Jill texted you.<eos> You went through my phone?<eos> It was lying right there and it buzzed, and I couldn't help it.
- Feeling.<eos> Emotion.<eos> I mean, there's some heartbreaking stuff in here.<eos> Um... The lighter.<eos> The lighter.<eos> From your daughter with the engraving "Please come home, Mom."<eos> It said "Don't forget me."<eos> Even better.<eos> See, Laurie, that's what this book wants to be.<eos> If you want people to connect with it, you have to tell them how it felt.
Warm.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Getting warmer.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You're getting real hot now, Kevin.<eos> Oh, you're on goddamn fire.<eos> You still here, man?<eos> Yeah, I just... I lost my phone when I was out here earlier today.<eos> Find it?<eos> Yeah, I did. It's bricked, so...
Be my own man, you know. (CHUCKLES)<eos> Back on Krypton, no one was their own man.<eos> Growing up, I was taught that to accept help from people is not a shame, it's an honor.<eos> Your cousin never talks about Krypton.<eos> He was a baby when we left.<eos> But I remember it.<eos> All the time.<eos> Did he ever tell you what that "S" means?<eos> The House of El.<eos> Yes, but, it also stands for a Kryptonian phrase, our family motto.

Just shut up!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Why do you keep following me?<eos> If you want me to do something, just fucking say it.<eos> [exhales]<eos> I'm glad you finally asked, Kevin.<eos> There is something you need to do.<eos> In Cairo, Egypt, there is an ancient artifact.<eos> It's in a museum now. They found it in the tomb of Amenhotep.
I'm ready.<eos> That should do it.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's poison.<eos> It's gonna stop your heart.<eos> You said temporarily.<eos> That I did. That I did.<eos> This... epinephrine.<eos> That poison's gonna work like a heroin overdose.<eos> It's gonna shut you down.
And I'm thinking to myself,<eos> "Shit, now I'm gonna have to kiss that thing because that's what one must endure if you want to get elected."<eos> So I pucker up and you know what that young man does?<eos> He hands me the baby and he just walks away.<eos> He gave me his child and he disappeared.<eos> Police couldn't find him.<eos> No wife or mother stepped forward to claim it.<eos> And that baby is now in an orphanage and it's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna grow up and it's gonna have difficulty attaching to people and it's gonna have difficulty giving and accepting love.
Oh, my God, Meg! Let go of me!<eos> Oh!<eos> No!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Help us!<eos> Help!<eos> Although the observable universe is continually expanding, there's really no way of knowing if the whole thing is gonna ultimately collapse into one gargantuan black hole.<eos> Wow, there's actually something our little genius doesn't know.<eos> I will tell you one thing for sure.<eos> My universe is expanding and it is pretty frickin' stormy.
And I get this one.<eos> One of these kids is doing his own thing.<eos> And it's sticking out, you know, kinda like a turtle head.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Well if I had a gun to my head, I'd say it's a map.<eos> We know that, but where does it lead?<eos> The answer is in a manuscript.<eos> A codex.<eos> The Savini Codex.<eos> It was the last surviving document written by a Spanish friar during the time of La Conquista.
I've had rather a sad letter from Mr Branson.<eos> Listen.<eos> "I dreamt last night I was in the park at Downton,<eos> "walking with Sybbie under the great trees," "listening to the pigeons cooing in their branches."<eos> "And when I woke, my eyes were filled with tears."<eos> - That's very moving.<eos> I owe him a letter.<eos> I'll write after Carson's wedding.<eos> Talking of which, I feel sorry for Mrs Hughes.<eos> I said I'd brighten up her frock far her. But when she gave it me, it was an ordinary old day dress and there wasn't much I could do.
_<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You're going to be so pretty.<eos> _<eos> I had the photo enhanced.<eos> It's a rough extrapolation of features since the face was almost entirely blown out.
God knows my wife wouldn't commit any felonies for my behalf.<eos> I'm sure you're thinking up all of the moves you have left.<eos> Careful.<eos> The people I speak for won't hesitate to hurt you or her if they need to.<eos> So, what now?<eos> Like I said, all will soon be revealed.<eos> Come on.<eos> I think they're, uh, almost ready to start.<eos> A package arrived for you.<eos> It was flagged by security.
I gave myself a break, Travis, a long time.<eos> Turns out I can do a lot more things than I thought I could.<eos> I know.<eos> I mean, I-I always knew it.<eos> No... you always said it.<eos> If I had seven years now, I could go to med school, be a doctor.<eos> It's too bad, 'cause that's what she needs.<eos> Forget the fractures, the lacerations.<eos> When the foot was crushed, the tissue began to die.<eos> And it will die.
Big family.<eos> Uh, names, please?<eos> I got Travis Manawa and, uh, Madison Clark.<eos> Uh, Nicholas Clark, Alicia Clark,<eos> Elizabeth Ortiz, Christopher Manawa.<eos> Daniel Salazar, Griselda Salazar, Ofelia Salazar.<eos> Okay, make sure that everyone in your family stays inside.<eos> Can you tell me where you took my neighbor, Patrick Tran?<eos> Your neighbor was covered in the infected's blood.<eos> It was his wife's blood.
Travis says we're the lucky ones.<eos> He'd throw those dudes a parade if they'd let him.<eos> And, look, we are grateful to our saviors, to the ones who protect us, to those who know when it's feeding time at the zoo.<eos> Turns out there's nothing you'll ever take that nature won't take back.<eos> It all belongs to her again.<eos> And the dogs and the dead and the...<eos> Hello.<eos> Hey, we have to repaint the family room.<eos> We did last week.<eos> I know, it needs a new coat.
This is where they bring me.<eos> I was young.<eos> The man with the blade and the man in the chair, they're not different.<eos> They both suffer.<eos> Their lives are changed forever.<eos> They bring me in and they give me a choice.<eos> Which man will I be?<eos> Please.<eos> Please stop.<eos> This word, it's used many times in your radio transmissions, so I know it's important.
40 pounds.<eos> Even with a few organs missing, there's no way that Maggie Halpern could've been carrying all of it.<eos> Maybe he sold some in Brazil?<eos> Or he had more than one mule.<eos> That would mean Maggie was not the only person that the smugglers killed.<eos> I'll reach out to Otero again, see if he can get us a list of Escanso's most recent patients.<eos> If Escanso and his partners did utilize extra mules, all 40 pounds of the diamorphine could be in New York already.<eos> There's a happy thought.<eos> Well, if we can locate the heroin, we might be able to find the man who butchered Miss Halpern.<eos> Well, if it's here already, it's as good as gone, isn't it?
When he didn't show, I went across the street to wait for him at a coffee shop.<eos> We go there, show your picture around, they gonna remember you?<eos> They should.<eos> Oh, and just in case, check with the MTA, too.<eos> I had to take four different busses just to get there.<eos> I'm sure I'll show up on those cameras.<eos> We'll start with them.<eos> Any luck, the footage backs you up.<eos> It will.<eos> Course it will.
This meeting is over.<eos> Marty?<eos> Uh, I-I-I-I need to think.<eos> That guy out there, he's probably a cop.<eos> This, they can't use it.<eos> Physical evidence discovered as a result of your testimony is inadmissible.<eos> They want to scare you into saying something that's not covered.<eos> Martin, you should stay.<eos> You're not gonna hear this offer a second time.<eos> It's not an offer; it's a trick.
I will miss her with all my heart.<eos> Dawn's first light offers us an advantage... the road to the port should be largely unoccupied.<eos> I won't feel safe until we're aboard that ship<eos> - and bound for England.<eos> - Understandably.<eos> Queen Elizabeth's new king consort would be a prize captive for any Frenchman.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Whoa.<eos> A fire.<eos> It's coming from the village.
Not too good.<eos> For some reason, I couldn't locate the Diplomatic Bag.<eos> Do you know anything about that?<eos> - No.<eos> - Nope?<eos> Not a thing.<eos> Let's see if we can change your luck.<eos> It's easier if you have a system.<eos> What's your system?<eos> Well, I bet black because it's your favorite color.
Good luck. Good luck.<eos> You know, it's a funny thing, pressure.<eos> Once you have the weight of the world on your shoulders, the rest of it is easy.<eos> That's 120.<eos> You need 38 points.<eos> Double 19.<eos> Ashok... do you like your car?<eos> I love my car.<eos> Good.<eos> Because it's yours.
Ashok... do you like your car?<eos> I love my car.<eos> Good.<eos> Because it's yours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good game.<eos> But that thing that I said about my word?<eos> I lied.<eos> I'm keeping the car!<eos> - It's mine now, okay?
They'll capture it, and one frame is all they need.<eos> No biggie.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> No wonder they want your picture.<eos> - Over here! - Bill.<eos> Oliver. Will the King call for abolition?<eos> Is there a connection?<eos> Sam, you know you published those pictures out of context, so does he.<eos> What do you say about referendum rumors?<eos> Will it happen?
But, like you, my first duty is to be a parent, a husband... a person of integrity who does what's best for his family.<eos> I think this is what is best for mine, and for the family of this nation as a whole.<eos> Look into your hearts.<eos> I have looked into mine.<eos> Britain will always be great.<eos> Not because of the empty symbolism of a corrupted crown, but because of you... each one of you.<eos> And this nation will be greater still once every citizen is his or her own king or queen.<eos> This I firmly believe, and it is why, after much solemn thought,<eos> Your Prime Minister is in full agreement, and a bill is being prepared.<eos> It will be brought to the floor of Parliament tomorrow morning, at which time I shall sign it.
Yes.<eos> Don't make me ask twice.<eos> Any other day, I'd be happy to help you, Mum. But Dad's disappointed in me.<eos> So...<eos> Well, he's not the only one.<eos> I'll be going out tonight.<eos> Just my father and me. I need you to look the other way. It's important for me.<eos> - How'd it go with the paps?<eos> - You haven't seen?<eos> My phone was blowing up after Dad's speech, so I shut it off.
The King was attacked.<eos> The people don't want to hear about love.<eos> The people always want to hear about love.<eos> They want their Queen to be honest and raw and vulnerable.<eos> They want to see you as one of them.<eos> I'm the Queen of England.<eos> You are now, but once upon a time, you were simply a young girl who placed the duties of her family before her own heart's desire.<eos> Eventually, your heart got the better of you and you slipped.<eos> I was married to the King by then - and we had a son.<eos> The heart wants what it wants.
The shoes are a present.<eos> So, it's not so... specific.<eos> -Thanks, honey. -You're welcome.<eos> Say hi to mom at home for me.<eos> Yeah, with regard to that profile.<eos> -You don't have to tell anybody about it.<eos> It's because I have a girlfriend, so I'm not really gay.<eos> You just like to have sex with men?<eos> No, it's ...<eos> I was just curious about what it was.
Welcome back.<eos> - I wasn't about to miss this. - I know.<eos> Wanted to see what these freaks were like in person.<eos> It's really good to see you. Lev!<eos> You look so fragile.<eos> I want to hug you, but...<eos> Just be careful, Bodie.<eos> Heard the new game was pretty cool.<eos> Decided to check it out.<eos> Yeah, I think you'll dig it. Thanks for coming.
Thank you all for coming.<eos> And now I would like to introduce to you the mind behind Mutiny, our leader Cameron Howe!<eos> - All right, Cameron! - Howe! Howe!<eos> Howe!<eos> Hi, I'm Cameron. Nice start!<eos> Uh...<eos> There it is.<eos> Um... oh, we have an announcement to make.<eos> Uh, today we're putting the finishing touches on our latest game.<eos> It's called "Extract Defend." Yeah!
Okay.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I was wonderin' if I could hang around here for awhile.<eos> 'Till you got home from school.'<eos> Yeah, I'll just tell my mom.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Why don't you hold onto this?<eos> In case you wanna talk to someone.<eos> - I can't take your phone.<eos> - No, it's not mine.

No, I'm fine.<eos> So if Charles died in Radley it would say it in his patient file?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What if he was released?<eos> It would be noted there too.<eos> So if we get that file, we get the truth.<eos> Assuming it still exists, it could be confetti by now.<eos> Well, we have to find out one way or another.<eos> I looked up the data center.<eos> It's 20 minutes from here.
Last year, when I got hurt in that elevator and I thought Wilden was after me I needed a place to hide out.<eos> I knew nobody was living at Aunt Carol's, so I drove up.<eos> But when I arrived, someone was there.<eos> Jason?<eos> Why aren't you at the hospital?<eos> They let me out.<eos> What are you doin'?<eos> Getting the, uh, property ready to sell?<eos> No. I'm keeping the house.<eos> And I want it to look nice.
What did you make me do?<eos> 'Spencer?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Do you remember everything that Charles made you do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't you? No.<eos> No, not really.<eos> I, um, I-I could barely sleep in there 'cause every time I'd fall asleep this really loud buzzer would go off and.. ...one night, finally, the buzzer didn't go off and so I fell asleep.<eos> Then when I woke up, my.. ...hands were completely covered in blood.<eos> I have no idea what happened or whose blood it was.

No.<eos> No, not really.<eos> I, um, I-I could barely sleep in there 'cause every time I'd fall asleep this really loud buzzer would go off and.. ...one night, finally, the buzzer didn't go off and so I fell asleep.<eos> Then when I woke up, my.. ...hands were completely covered in blood.<eos> I have no idea what happened or whose blood it was.<eos> And then the next morning it was gone.
- Carol's?<eos> Why?<eos> I thought somebody might..<eos> Never mind.<eos> You should know why we put Charles in Radley.<eos> When you were 11 months old.. ...your mother was out in the garden with Jason.<eos> I put you in your crib to take a nap and then.. ...went outside to turn on the grill.<eos> When I came back I heard you screaming.<eos> I ran upstairs and found you in the tub.<eos> 'The water was on..' ...it was scalding hot and rising fast and..
Maybe you should figure that one out.<eos> I like.<eos> Are, uh, dolls your thing?<eos> No.<eos> Actually, I find them pretty creepy but, um.... it's this new thing I'm trying.<eos> Embracing the creepy.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> I, um, did this project last year, where I took vegetables and did a photo progression as they rotted.<eos> That sounds pretty cool.<eos> How'd it turn out?
And it would be great if you could too.<eos> That.... may not happen overnight.<eos> Mona's complicated.<eos> Okay?<eos> But she is not the real monster here.<eos> That person hasn't been caught yet.<eos> Maybe you're right .but I still can't help but wonder if that . Radley place helped Mona or made her worse.<eos> Well, she's not the only one.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> That nut house may have closed down but it still holds all the answers.
What does this one mean?<eos> That is the Japanese symbol for courage.<eos> 'It's got your name on it.'<eos> No, but it could.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Could you hold my phone?<eos> Where do you want it?<eos> Maybe right.... here.<eos> It's just really tender.<eos> Well, it ain't gonna hurt any less with a needle in it.
I wish I had more answers for you, but the truth is, I'm on the outside looking in, too.<eos> I hate it.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> I am so embarrassed.<eos> I thought I put my ticket in my bag, but I can't find it.<eos> And now, I'm thinking I may have used it to throw away my gum.<eos> Um, which one is yours?<eos> Ugh, God, this is so weird.<eos> Um, I just got it back from the dealership, and they changed the key chain.<eos> But it's a dark green Range Rover. Tan interior--
Um, which one is yours?<eos> Ugh, God, this is so weird.<eos> Um, I just got it back from the dealership, and they changed the key chain.<eos> But it's a dark green Range Rover. Tan interior--<eos> I need the ticket, miss.<eos> Have you checked your pockets?<eos> I thought that I checked everything.<eos> Maybe you left it on the table.<eos> Oh, come on, you know the car.<eos> It has, like, a Harvvich bumper sticker on the back, a really nice smell inside like cinnamon toast.
I, I turned, uh, onto that street behind the school and I felt like I was being followed.<eos> By Who?<eos> There was this dark car. It was going real slow.<eos> - Did the car hit you?<eos> -lt suddenly sped up, and the side mirror smashed into my elbow and...<eos> I, I have to clean this up before your mom sees it.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I'll do it. Okay?<eos> Just look at me.<eos> If I show you a picture, can you tell me if it was the same car?
Nobody's ever gonna hear it.<eos> Thanks again.<eos> You didn't have to do this.<eos> Emily, I just want you to know whatever happens you mean a lot to me.<eos> Ezra.. ...I don't want you to come with me to LA.<eos> What?<eos> When I go there this summer for my internship.. ...I need to go alone.<eos> I saw your airline confirmation on your phone. I...<eos> I know that you bought a ticket to LA.<eos> Ahem, did you also see that it was a.. ...a layover on my way to Thailand?
She was here.<eos> I swear it.<eos> Ali's dead.<eos> I saw her too.<eos> So did I.<eos> I knew I wasn't crazy.<eos> You really were alive.<eos> If you really cared about me why did you keep playing the game?<eos> When your friends thought they killed A in New York it was the perfect time to end it.<eos> I left the country thinking it was over.
The agent back there, the CI he mentioned?<eos> That could be my chance to find out something about the woman holding me in that photo.<eos> Why would a Russian CI have information about your mother?<eos> Ressler.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Just leaving the Orea.<eos> Why? Reddington called.<eos> Karakurt is in possession of an ANFO IED.<eos> We've identified the vehicle.<eos> It's a white moving truck rented out of Annapolis, plate number Delta-Kilo-5-8-2-7.
How is that possible?<eos> He's created a supercharged rotavirus.<eos> These are very common.<eos> By the age of 5, most of us have been infected multiple times.<eos> And with each infection, we build up an immunity.<eos> So it's harmless to most people.<eos> All people.<eos> Precisely.<eos> But this rotavirus has been customized, keyed to infect one individual with a unique genetic sequence, and to devastating effect.<eos> According to the animal trials logged in these notes, it attacks the central nervous system within minutes of exposure.

Aram, I need your assistance locating the source of a call. That was placed to a pay phone.<eos> I can't stress enough the urgency of this matter.<eos> I don't think you have any real comprehension. Of the depth and breadth of your vulnerability.<eos> But, only the one who possesses the fulcrum. Could possibly fathom that.<eos> I don't think you have it.<eos> I don't think you ever did.<eos> The fulcrum, if you have it, If you can prove you have it, Do it now.<eos> Your life depends on it.<eos> I have the fulcrum.<eos> Tell me what it is and I'll tell you where to find it.
You are the one who hurts liz the most.<eos> She's here, in this, right now, because of you.<eos> And I know I played a part in that, I'm not saying I didn't,<eos> But I'm trying to fix that.<eos> So, I told her the truth about us.<eos> I'm telling you this because I don't want you to be confused. About my part in any of this.<eos> You, liz...<eos> All of it, I'm out.<eos> I'm done.<eos> There is a device, it's called a bubble module.

She took him to Marigold. Didn't tell him why.<eos> - Nor should she.<eos> - She must eventually.<eos> Let her make that decision for herself.<eos> Now you need some sleep before your hideous day tomorrow.<eos> Andrew?<eos> What were you doing in Mr Barrow's room?<eos> We were...<eos> I was borrowing a book.<eos> What book? Where is it?
Thank you, Mr Molesley.<eos> Don't run.<eos> Don't run.<eos> I'm sorry for the wait.<eos> Can you form parties of 10?<eos> We've been here since 9:00.<eos> You are in the next group.<eos> CORA: No, the third Earl built it.<eos> Well, he didn't really build it so much as, envelope it, because this room is originally medieval.<eos> It was the monks' refectory of an Abbey that King Henry sold after the Dissolution of the Monasteries.
No. But I will not beat about the bush either, Mr Barrow.<eos> Someone has reported that you have a private understanding with Andrew.<eos> Not this again.<eos> I might not have given ii much mind but I was upstairs last night late and I saw him leave your room.<eos> How long do I have to work in this house before I am given credit?<eos> That is all very well, but we are talking about a young man and I must look to his welfare.<eos> If I were to give you my word nothing took place of which you disapprove?<eos> If I could just be sure.<eos> So my word is still not good enough, Mr Carson, after so many years?<eos> I only wish it were.
Almost everyone we know is selling their London house, but that's not for me to say.<eos> I went past the site of Devonshire House on my way home.<eos> There's something vast going up in its place.<eos> - Flats, offices and salerooms.<eos> - People don't want palaces any more,<eos> - even if they can afford them. - They were fun.<eos> In my youth, all great hostesses used to have luncheon laid for 20 every day.<eos> If you turned up in time, you sat down to a lovely feed.<eos> Sorry, Lady Rosamund. I thought dinner would be finished.<eos> And so it should be.
-Hi, honey.<eos> -What are you doing here?<eos> -I'm working.<eos> -OK.<eos> -And who's this?<eos> A new friend?<eos> No, we're not, it's just that Rita's given us an assignment.<eos> We have to do a poem.<eos> She's cut up an old poem, and we have to put it back together in a new way.<eos> We're presenting it Friday, and it's to teach us about collaboration.
And tracing license plates in Thailand?<eos> Uh, sir, I was following up on some new leads about Castle's disappearance.<eos> In connection to Chuck Norris?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Kate, I know how important this is to him. But these leads, are they solid? Or is Mr. Castle just grasping at straws?<eos> I dug into that tattoo.<eos> That insignia...<eos> that means Delta Force, right? Yeah.<eos> It's also the title of a Chuck Norris movie.
What were you doing when this buzzing first started?<eos> I was writing.<eos> Or, rather, procrastinating.<eos> I was stuck on a scene, so I was just people-watching.<eos> Anyone you knew?<eos> Or recognized?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That ringing... it started when I looked up at the TV.
So you're a spy? Not a spy.<eos> Look, after I left the intelligence service, I lost my way.<eos> I joined Al-Qaeda.<eos> You were in Al-Qaeda?<eos> Can you please keep your voice down?<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> I rose up to become a part of their senior leadership.<eos> And now you're bussing tables and you live here?<eos> I chose this life.<eos> It's my penance.
Try not to get in trouble, okay?<eos> All troops from the quarantine zone. They are used only for security.<eos> We must ensure that contamination does not spread. And we assure you that we do everything. For this to be normalized soon.<eos> People ask what makes a weapons depot there, Minister.<eos> Well, we do not want a prejudgment.<eos> Nobody should know that the weapons existed.<eos> It was classified information.<eos> I was ten floors below ground, for the love of god.<eos> True.<eos> And it was declared clean 70 years.
You can trust me.<eos> I 'll handle.<eos> I think you should see this.<eos> Toxicology blood sample abnormally high levels of norepinephrine.<eos> And neuromodulators found significant levels in the spinal fluid.<eos> The death rate is consistent with all other.<eos> Were you given the antidote?<eos> Yup.<eos> Y?<eos> It made no difference, so it is.
Look at you without your fancy jewelry.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Do you hear what I'm saying...?<eos> - After you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> One tree was twenty five.<eos> Have you met my daughter?<eos> My life won't be worth living... if I go home without it.<eos> You know what, Mervyn?<eos> It's all yours.
Mick, you've seen Noelle around?<eos> Sure, she was in the little bus... with all her little school pals and a teacher of theirs.<eos> Where was she going?<eos> I think they said... Stormont.<eos> Stormont?<eos> For the love of...<eos> We will hear now from Mr. Pat McKerrod about the Pottersglen development.<eos> An undertaking that will save over 150 jobs.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.<eos> It gives me a great pleasure to announce...
Did Lane put you up to this? Is this some sort of prank?<eos> No, Santa put me up to this.<eos> He wanted to make sure you qualified for the position.<eos> Santa put...<eos> What position? The vice president of Christmas?<eos> Ho, ho, ho!<eos> Very funny! Dax, haven't you ever heard of "Santa's little helper"?<eos> The dog from The Simpsons?<eos> It's a nickname for the Head Office Herald of Holiday Operations.<eos> It's the second most important job in the North Pole.
What does your wife think?<eos> She died two years ago. An accident.<eos> - Excuse me. I'm sorry.<eos> - No. It's OK.<eos> The cause of death is hanging.<eos> The victim was conscious, there are signs of premortem hypokinesia. - Muscular paralysis? Nervous.<eos> I've started some tests.<eos> I need a comparison of the blood on his forehead with a suspect's blood.<eos> Does he have a crest and wings?<eos> It's chicken blood.
And the windshield was cracked.<eos> And then I looked over and I saw Leo.<eos> When you looked over at Leo, could you see Evan Lee - through the window?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He went and he got into his car.<eos> Car or truck?<eos> When you saw Evan Lee leave, did he... sit down into his car or... step up into it?<eos> He stepped up.<eos> He stepped up. It was a truck.<eos> - It was a big green truck.
- A stick?<eos> - Instead of luring them away, we need to... we need to chase them out.<eos> Back in vet school, I had a... very hot professor who had a thing for bats.<eos> Details not important.<eos> Or appropriate.<eos> Anyway,<eos> I spent a very memorable night listening to her theories, one of which was high-pitched frequencies repel bats.<eos> If this thing has a joystick control board instead of an EMP, I can... I can... I can build an oscillator.<eos> It's a... it's a device that puts out a continual sound frequency.<eos> Well... there it is.
I was in shock.<eos> I was scared, that's all.<eos> What were you doing on the cliff the night of the murder?<eos> A witness saw you.<eos> No.<eos> I was in my studio.<eos> I was painting.<eos> You'll have to find a better alibi.<eos> What happened to your GPS?<eos> It's in a rough shape.
I was in my studio.<eos> I was painting.<eos> You'll have to find a better alibi.<eos> What happened to your GPS?<eos> It's in a rough shape.<eos> We'll get it to talk, you know.<eos> Did you buy the GPS?<eos> I gave it to Léa.<eos> She needed it for work. She was always driving around.<eos> Was it a way to track your wife's movements?
Ladies.<eos> Do you mind if I go back to the station?<eos> No problem.<eos> With this murder, I'm behind on my paperwork.<eos> Ah!<eos> Captain.<eos> We got a call.<eos> People saw movement in a neighbors' house, but they're gone.<eos> I'm not on duty.<eos> It's the Castaldis' house.
Précéguet?<eos> An old man who accidentally set his living room on fire.<eos> He was more scared than anything.<eos> After that, he went to a retirement home.<eos> Fire?<eos> Soot...<eos> She found something there.<eos> - What?<eos> - Can we see the house?<eos> Yes, but it's empty.
Well, that's just one more case for the pile, but we are gonna help you close it.<eos> CSU isn't.<eos> They just got back from Calvin Barnes's place.<eos> There's plenty of blonde hair and fingerprints, but nothing you wouldn't expect inside the home of two blonde people with a golden retriever.<eos> The attack was four weeks ago.<eos> That foyer has been cleaned by housekeepers, - if not the assailant himself.<eos> - You any closer to telling me why someone would want to kill a bunch of bees up and down the Northeast?<eos> Well, my most promising theory was that it was an attempt to manipulate the commodities exchange.<eos> New York is the second largest grower of apples in the United States.<eos> The business is reliant on pollination by bees, so, it would most assuredly be impacted.
A few remembered a guard stationed outside his door two nights ago- - Rasheed.<eos> The next day, when all the other guards were rushing around in a panic, Rasheed was nowhere to be seen.<eos> And now he just cannot be found.<eos> And this hearsay is the basis of your contention that Mr. Musharakh absconded with his charge?<eos> There was no blood at the scene, no sign of a struggle.<eos> But then, there wouldn't be if Rasheed had just walked him out of a fire exit.<eos> Well, nor would there be if he just checked out and found alternate accommodations.<eos> A possibility.<eos> If he had not abandoned his epinephrine with the rest of his toiletries.<eos> It's prescribed for a deathly peanut allergy and I doubt he would willfully travel without it.
Why do you get to go?<eos> Because I stood up first.<eos> And as tiresome as calling these establishments may be, one of us has to finish the list.<eos> We can't put all our eggs in one basket, can we?<eos> I've interviewed blind men who were better witnesses than that.<eos> Three of them.<eos> No, four.<eos> Can't fault the owner for having a broken surveillance system.<eos> Of course I could.<eos> If it had been broken.
Are you Nazi?<eos> No, I'm no Nazi.<eos> I'm a psychologist.<eos> My job is to figure out what has happened to you.<eos> I'm trying to understand why someone who was fine a year ago, suddenly ends up here.<eos> You were doing great.<eos> In the middle of no man's land, surrounded by Nazis.<eos> Espen, you're so brave.<eos> Brave, strong and sexy.<eos> As far as I can tell, you led a normal life until it stopped up.
When I was a child, my planet Krypton was dying.<eos> I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so, I hid my powers, until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media. But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> KARA:<eos> Previously on "Supergirl"...<eos> I've seen this picture.<eos> It won a Pulitzer.
- Rent out a museum or something.<eos> - Um...<eos> And move Dave out there to another desk.<eos> I find his hair distracting.<eos> Um, Dave, I need a favor.<eos> The story is spreading like wildfire across social media.<eos> - Cat Grant's latest exclusive on National City's mysterious new arrival, Supergirl.<eos> Everyone has questions about the so-called Girl of Steel, and this first and only interview is promising answers, including intimate details about who she is, where she's from and what she's doing here.<eos> (SUIT POWERING UP)<eos> It also confirms her relationship to the Man of Steel himself.

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)<eos> (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)<eos> - Where are you taking us?<eos> - To your new office.<eos> I think Ms. Grant prefers me to be within yelling distance.<eos> WINN:<eos> Oh, no. Not for that job.<eos> For our other job.<eos> This used to be Ed Flaherty's office from Actuaries but after he died of a heart attack behind his desk, nobody wants it.<eos> Which makes it perfect for our needs.
I've got a key and the new code.<eos> -Are the paintings there?<eos> -Sure thing.<eos> -Now we just have to...<eos> -That will be no problem.<eos> Fuck!<eos> (Espen:) They have used us to get to the picture.<eos> -So it's that bad.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Which picture is it?
Let's do one more coup.<eos> Just the two of us.<eos> All right, Snake.<eos> Okay!<eos> Show me what you've got!<eos> This is the gallery.<eos> The picture is called Esther by a Norwegian called Edvard Munch.<eos> -It's worth 120 million dollars.<eos> -Cheers to that!<eos> It's under strict surveillance by the latest technology to protect it from people like us.
I want in.<eos> My dark lord is already inside the boy.<eos> And come the comet... We shall let him out.<eos> What kind of mother would abandon her only child to the woods?<eos> The night is our playground.<eos> You said that once you were sure, you would tell me the secret tor destroying Countess Marburg.<eos> You spoke of an object.<eos> She keeps it close. Where?<eos> On the ship?<eos> It is the ship.
So you gave him away.<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't give him away.<eos> We sold him to the devil himself like I was sold as a slave time and time again.<eos> But unlike me, he fetched a great price.<eos> I told you then... In return, all the world would be yours.<eos> And so it is.<eos> And so it will be if you could just learn to harden your heart.<eos> What if I never wanted the world?<eos> What if a heart, a real heart, and the love that goes with it, is all I ever wanted?
Me.<eos> Until yesterday.<eos> - Tell me about it.<eos> - You didn't see the play?<eos> Edmund Peake's Performers.<eos> Three or four summers back.<eos> That season's hot ticket until Parliament shut it down.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Blasphemy.<eos> It's about this madman who finds a way to resurrect... I know.
May I come in, please?<eos> I will be brief.<eos> You find me at work.<eos> I'm a writer.<eos> I know.<eos> You've met my creature.<eos> Indeed.<eos> And was... unsettled by it.<eos> Some might say that was its intention.<eos> May I ask how it originated?
I will be brief.<eos> You find me at work.<eos> I'm a writer.<eos> I know.<eos> You've met my creature.<eos> Indeed.<eos> And was... unsettled by it.<eos> Some might say that was its intention.<eos> May I ask how it originated?<eos> It came to me in a nightmare.
I renounce them all.<eos> Poor mite.<eos> I baptise thee, Katherine, in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<eos> To you, gentle Father we humbly commit this child, so precious in your sight.<eos> Welcome her into your presence where there is no sorrow nor pain, but the fullness of peace and joy with you for ever and ever.<eos> Amen.<eos> Mr Marlott?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I know how prayer can prompt unwanted thoughts.<eos> Perhaps it might help you to share them.
Quickly, before Lord Shelley returns.<eos> I don't want to stay here, Mama.<eos> I told you... I have important business to attend to.<eos> You must stay here with your grandparents.<eos> What business?<eos> It concerns my book. And the gentleman who came to call.<eos> You must leave.<eos> Now! Is your book more important than me?<eos> Nothing is more important than you.<eos> But it has caused great misery in this world. And... I must make sure it doesn't cause any more.
I'm having that tie one way or another.<eos> Ever thought of leaving the nest yourself?<eos> I was the first to arrive, I shall be the last to leave.<eos> You recall us speaking about my hopes for the building to be a crucible for change?<eos> Of course.<eos> Well, all this has made me realize something quite fundamental.<eos> It wasn't that I left an element out, it was that I put too many in.<eos> And now the building's failure has offered those people the beginnings of a means of escape to a new life.<eos> Who knows...<eos> Perhaps it will become a paradigm for future developments.
I can assure you, I have no interest in your personal property.<eos> Because I ask myself why would a great man like you feel the need to hide behind women's skirts?<eos> Behind children, even.<eos> Your own, as well as others'.<eos> How dare you judge me! How dare...<eos> Helen!<eos> That's right.<eos> You sit there and think about what you've done.<eos> On the whole, life in the high-rise was good.<eos> There had been no obvious point at which it had moved into a clearly more sinister dimension.
Eight months. - Right.<eos> - Tea?<eos> Er, no, thanks.<eos> Biscuit, then? OK.<eos> I'll, er, bring the model in one day.<eos> You can see it.<eos> Tom, mate, you going to tell Gran about what we did yesterday?<eos> Well, we went on a tour of Villa Park, it's a football ground, and it was really, really good.<eos> We saw everything -- the pitch, the changing rooms, the museum bit at the back of the club with the history.<eos> - Can you remember when it was built? - Yeah. - What?

It's fine.<eos> I asked you to bring in details of your finances... There.<eos> These are just your current account.<eos> Presumably, there are other savings, investments?<eos> He handles the money, always has done.<eos> Why?<eos> He said he was better at it.<eos> So, you don't know your financial situation at all?<eos> No, I suppose...<eos> This project, what's it called?

And will it pay off?<eos> He says it's doing well. He "says"...
How does he describe me? He makes you sound like an animal.<eos> Really?<eos> Feral.<eos> You don't see that?<eos> How is Simon?<eos> You see him more than I do some weeks.<eos> Tell me how he's getting on at work.<eos> Simon's ambitious, as you know.<eos> This project's a big step for him.<eos> Will it make money?

- That'll be all right, won't it, Susie?<eos> - Absolutely. For these two, we will make it work, come on!<eos> Come in!<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Positive. - (Honestly, I think we should go.)<eos> We've got the kids in tonight so there'll be plenty of food, it'll be fun!<eos> - I'm really not... - Come on!<eos> - God, it's gorgeous.<eos> You have a place in France?<eos> What's it called?
Come in!<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Positive. - (Honestly, I think we should go.)<eos> We've got the kids in tonight so there'll be plenty of food, it'll be fun!<eos> - I'm really not... - Come on!<eos> - God, it's gorgeous.<eos> You have a place in France?<eos> What's it called?<eos> - The house?<eos> - Does it have a name?
It's beautiful.<eos> Hope you don't mind me showing off?<eos> If you look at the end there, you can see the pool.<eos> We loved the pool in our house in France so much that we copied the dimensions.<eos> You have a place in France?<eos> Yeah. Well, you can go and stay there if you like.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, we have a wonderful maid called Angelique who sorts everything out.<eos> The house?<eos> Does it have a name?
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> I didn't want to tell him like that.<eos> Then you should've been better.<eos> I thought he was dead!<eos> You made me think...<eos> It's my hair.<eos> It smells of him.
What do we know about that place?<eos> - I don't know. We'll find out.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey, Ryan, you find anything in Sid's office?<eos> No, just paperwork and spreadsheets.<eos> So nothing that speaks to a possible kidnapping?<eos> Pretty straightforward stuff, but I'll bring it in so we can go through it with a fine-tooth comb. Beckett, we got something.<eos> Okay, Ryan, I got to go.<eos> That building where Evelyn was taken is an abandoned warehouse.<eos> It's the ideal location to hold someone hostage.
We're the police. You're safe now.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> I just had stopped to stretch, and the next thing I knew, there was a rag over my mouth, and...<eos> Uh, when I came to, I was in that warehouse.<eos> At any point in time, did you get a look at your kidnapper's face?<eos> He always wore a mask.<eos> It was like a ski mask, but shiny, with a silver zigzag up the middle and... a gold headband.<eos> A gold headband?<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's what it was.
They did, but you're the king of rogue operations.<eos> I have to assume that you haven't shared everything with the FB... aah!<eos> You dumb bitch. I was telling you the truth.<eos> I don't know anything, but I'm sure as hell gonna find out about you now.<eos> Go!<eos> I told you I was gonna take your future.<eos> Until a few minutes ago, I thought that meant killing you, but the universe has given me a gift... your child to be.<eos> Agh!<eos> After all, aren't children our true future, Ryan?<eos> On the bright side, Gwen will survive at least until birth, and then I'm gonna take your kid and make sure it's raised like I was, abused and neglected with no idea who you are... ha ha ha... a fate worse than death
That there were hundreds of rats on board.<eos> Eventually, the ship ended up adrift, not far from the small resort community of Pender...<eos> Rats.<eos> ...where a fisherman claims to have seen thousands of rats leaving the ship and swimming for shore.<eos> When local authorities boarded the vessel, they found the crew dead, their bodies in a horrible condition, suggesting they had been attacked by the rats.<eos> Among the cargo was grain from a farm that uses Reiden pesticides.<eos> So what do you want us to do?<eos> Go to Pender Island.<eos> Conduct an initial threat assessment to determine if a containment protocol is necessary.<eos> Hopefully, it will not be.
But when she does, I'm allowed to come here.<eos> With Henry.<eos> I, um... brought you a present.<eos> Cool.<eos> A piece of paper.<eos> Open it.<eos> You do know I'm still at the age where I would play with a doll, right?<eos> A doll would've been fine.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> Just open it.
But answer me one thing:<eos> Why now?<eos> Why, after all this time, did you call and say you wanted to see her?<eos> Why now?<eos> Okay, let's assume, for a minute, that the cargo ship loaded with Reiden products accelerated the reproduction of the few rats on board.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay, then once the ship got close and was no longer safe, they had to find another viable option.<eos> This abandoned hotel.<eos> Hey, guys...<eos> It's...
It's about the tenth time you check it.<eos> I'm waiting for a call.<eos> -From whom?<eos> -The mayor.<eos> How fancy.<eos> My life is going to change.<eos> I'll be losing my job.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -This house.<eos> The caretaker's. It belongs to the school.
So, no eye contact, no conversations.<eos> Book me, Pablo.<eos> Are you sure that he can read it?<eos> Yeah, he said he could, but you know, that was years ago.<eos> First time I came here, I was looking for an authentic Viking helmet.<eos> I was bangin' this freaky chick who got me way into role-playing.<eos> I don't wanna hear this.<eos> Anyway, I told him about the book, and he freaked out.<eos> He said he can translate it, no problemo.<eos> I'm happy that we're sendin' evil back where it came from, that's for sure, but it makes me a little sad that we're already breaking' up the team.
The demon stays in the circle, there's no danger.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, will you tell him that we shouldn't be doing this?<eos> I've been waiting, my entire life to commune with the darkness.<eos> See?<eos> He loves it.<eos> Look Pablo, we're just gonna summon a teeny tiny demon.<eos> Like a mouse demon.<eos> Let's get Kelly in here, so we can take a team vote on it.<eos> Listen to me, every time I've faced evil, it had the jump on me.

Last chance!<eos> Hey Lionel, send this know-nothing waste of time back where it came from.<eos> - Nobody move!<eos> And what the fuck is that thing? !<eos> Come on, lady, you ruined my day twice already with this bullshit.<eos> Put the weapon down, or I will shoot you!<eos> Well as you can see, we're just a little busy here. Now!<eos> No.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Lionel, send it back!
How dare you.<eos> What do you mean I'm not liquid?<eos> Who told you to only save 10% cash?<eos> Well, I don't care what I said.<eos> Does my podiatrist listen to me when I tell him I have hammertoe?<eos> Is everything okay, Louis?<eos> Everything's wonderful.<eos> Okay.<eos> Actually, it occurred me that we have not discussed a very important subject.<eos> What is it?
It's just I don't have the juice at my firm and I was...<eos> I was too ashamed to tell you.<eos> Jimmy.<eos> No, Mike, listen.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you straight up.<eos> But please, these people need your help.<eos> What can I do for you, Jack?<eos> You can explain to me how the hell you justify making this much money.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> It was left in the copy machine.
Let me guess.<eos> You had him backdate your sale to yesterday, so it falls under your old pay structure.<eos> No, Louis, that's something you would do.<eos> Because unlike you, I don't actually care about the money.<eos> You expect me to believe that? I don't care whether you believe it or not.<eos> My compensation package was about recognizing what I do.<eos> Money was just a consequence.<eos> That's why I didn't mind sharing it with Donna.<eos> Now, get out.<eos> No. You did care about the money. Because it was the last thing you had that separated you from me.
Then you need to do some underhanded shit to make it unviolate the bylaws.<eos> And I already told you that I'm not doing anything like that again.<eos> Too bad, because you did it once.<eos> And if you don't want me telling anybody about it, you'll do it again.<eos> Good morning, Louis.<eos> Well, looks like you've been busy.<eos> I have.<eos> Here's the Crenshaw depo, and this is the Kirsch itinerary, and here's your music box.<eos> Why are you giving my gift back?<eos> Because it was a gift you gave me with a promise never to put me in a position like that again.
That's not covering for me. That's covering for you, because that should have been your idea in the first place, instead of welcoming every competitor we have into our offices behind my back.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about Robert Zane and you bringing him in here without consulting me.<eos> I didn't bring in shit.<eos> Mike Ross brought Zane in without asking, and I had to pretend to be on board with that too.<eos> And now you're hoping this leads to what you always wanted.<eos> This thing's over, Zane goes, and Mike heads out the door with him.<eos> That's enough. You need to get yourself under control right now.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about you have a problem, and it doesn't have anything to do with me.
Bullshit, you didn't throw them out.<eos> You ran out.<eos> No, I didn't run out. I'm telling you the truth.<eos> Okay, well, it doesn't matter, because I'm a psychiatrist, not a pharmacy, and if you want my help, you do it my way.<eos> You make regular appointments, and you commit to doing the work.<eos> And you show up at my house unannounced again, I'm calling the police.<eos> Do you have any time available ten minutes from now?<eos> I want to give you time to finish your dinner.<eos> Is the car ready?<eos> It's downstairs warming up, like you.
- Numbers that don't add up.<eos> - A pattern.<eos> That's your speciality, right?<eos> Recognizing patterns.<eos> Okay, you say once we access their finances.<eos> - How are we gonna do that?<eos> - That's the cool part.<eos> See, as far as we can tell, all top-level Reiden executives have access to their entire computer network.<eos> But the system doesn't use passwords.<eos> It uses facial recognition.
- Sure.<eos> What is it?<eos> - Where's your friend Jackson?<eos> - Over here!<eos> Jackson.<eos> Ice cold.<eos> He's been dead for at least a few days.<eos> - What is this place?<eos> - It's Fort de Châtillon.<eos> It was built in the 1870s, from the Prussian War.
Get in the truck, now.<eos> She likes to play rough.<eos> Reminds me of girl I used to know.<eos> Man like you must've put her in her place. Oh, no.<eos> She put me in mine.<eos> Didn't you... diosa?<eos> So that was your game, huh?<eos> Follow the flesh to Malvado's stronghold.<eos> You really think you can find his hideout?<eos> Well, it was working until you showed up.
You asked me to help you kill Malvado.<eos> We still can.<eos> I have a plan to give you everything.<eos> The problem with your plans, Carlos... is that you come with them.<eos> Oh, so you choose a... a myopic boy with his mother's milk on his chin.<eos> It's about Richard, isn't it?<eos> It's about you, and the prison of vengeance that you have built for yourself.<eos> Let me tell you something about prison, Carlitos.<eos> It's hard.<eos> And unjust. But after a while, it becomes your home.
Are you ready to sacrifice another young girl to him?<eos> You were that girl once.<eos> Where is that girl?<eos> - What's it like?<eos> - What's what like?<eos> You know, this whole cosa nostra snake-vampire thing you've been doing?<eos> You guys all sit around a table, eatin' gabagool with a little white mouse on top?<eos> - Swallow it whole?<eos> - Oh, that's hilarious.<eos> It is a rich and ancient tradition of which I'm privileged...
Wait. What?<eos> I don't think this is just a DDoS attack.<eos> I think they got a rootkit sitting inside the servers.<eos> What's a rootkit?<eos> It's like a crazy serial rapist with a very big dick!<eos> Jesus, Lloyd!<eos> Sorry, it's a malicious code that completely takes over their system.<eos> It could delete system files, install programs, - viruses, worms...<eos> - How do we stop it?<eos> That's the thing, it's fundamentally invisible.
I'm here to tell you I'm turning you in.<eos> I'm giving them all the information...<eos> Let me tell you why you're really here.<eos> You're here because you sense something wrong with the world.<eos> Something you can't explain.<eos> But, you know it controls you and everyone you care about.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Money.<eos> Money hasn't been real since we got off the gold standard.<eos> It's become virtual.
Not at all."<eos> Yeah, I got pretty cocky last year when it got some traction.<eos> I even made a mock-up.<eos> Cool.<eos> What is that?<eos> This is my pitch for what they should change the name to:<eos> the Washington Breadsticks.<eos> Is this real?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah, I mean, it sounds like Redskins.
Can you describe it?<eos> It wore a dark ragged coat with a mask like a doll's face.<eos> Like porcelain?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was white, with black where the eyes should have been.<eos> Were there markings on it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Like what?<eos> Like streaked teardrops coming from the eyes.<eos> Uh, and the... the face, it was, uh... bisected with two black lines, like a cross.
I do.<eos> Those people in there,<eos> I just told them what they wanted to hear.<eos> You're not gonna do it, are you?<eos> Change the world.<eos> Figures.<eos> You were only born a month ago.<eos> You're afraid.<eos> Afraid of your monster.<eos> Do you even know what it is?
Then who did?<eos> Then who did?<eos> Still smells of Chinese.<eos> Didn't you save a fortune cookie?<eos> They're burying me tomorrow.<eos> Feel no guilt, Inspector.<eos> I'm not talking to you.<eos> Guilt has quick ears to an accusation.<eos> I'm not talking to you today!<eos> I have always thought a country should be judged on how it treats its insane, rather than its sane.
- No, I stopped taking them.<eos> - That won't help, Tia.<eos> No, I looked it up. It's bad for the baby.<eos> If you take your medication and get well, you're showing that you can be responsible for yourself and for a child.<eos> If you don't, you won't see the world straight.<eos> Well, that can be overrated!<eos> Right, Tia?<eos> But if you don't, they will think that you're more of a threat to the baby than you actually are.<eos> And you will love that baby... won't you?<eos> They said it was a good size, on my last scan.

I'm a...<eos> I'm a good officer. But in this world, that's not enough. In this world, you have to be able to... nod and smile and drink a pint and say, "How was your day?"<eos> In this world, no-one can be... different or strange, or damaged... or they lock you up.<eos> So, what do I do?<eos> What do I do now?<eos> You keep talking.<eos> It needs charging, you doughnut.<eos> So?<eos> I had a second phone.<eos> Go on... try it.
- Please, Bill. - Bill!<eos> - I said get the hell away from me!<eos> Listen up!<eos> When I'm done, tie him off.<eos> Leave him here.<eos> You understand?<eos> Nobody cuts that body down till the birds pick it clean.<eos> We administered 200 micrograms of D-lysergic acid 30 minutes ago.<eos> Advanced interrogation technique.<eos> It's intended to break down inhibitions, psychic barriers, inducing a sensation of oneness.
Simmons was swallowed up by it.<eos> This was fish oil again?<eos> What can I say?<eos> We pulled the product off shelves, but we can't track down every bottle sold.<eos> The good news, if you want to call it that, is the deadly metallic elements sank to the bottom, so the chemical contaminating the sea life isn't deadly to humans, just game-changing for Inhumans.<eos> - The bad news...<eos> - It's not just in the fish oil.<eos> Where else could it have spread?<eos> Other sea life.<eos> With ocean currents, it's dispersed into the ecosystem.
She is new and shiny.<eos> And she likes a good challenge.<eos> I know.<eos> I spent the whole day with her.<eos> She jumps into new challenges all the time.<eos> And that's what this place is to her... her newest challenge...<eos> Until she finds her next one.<eos> And her next.<eos> But that's not me.<eos> See, I don't care if this place is the shiniest or the fanciest or if it's a beat-up hunk of junk.

It's a professional weapon.<eos> But what is that?<eos> Why didn't it burn like everything else?<eos> Well, it's titanium.<eos> It's probably a toe insert for a high-end tactical boot.<eos> So, what was this guy up to?<eos> He had only the best equipment.<eos> Unfortunately, it didn't do him much good.<eos> This stuff is amazing.<eos> It was invented for housing insulation, but its uses are endless.
He's into drugs, racketeering, human trafficking.<eos> So, if Jared was killed at Masbourian's house,<eos> Booth might be held captive there. We're going in.<eos> You coming with?<eos> In. Let's go.<eos> Clear.<eos> Take the lead.<eos> Holy...<eos> Three men down, third floor office.<eos> It's a freaking blood bath.
Is one of them Booth?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've got proof that Booth was there, and before you ask me if I'm sure, I sequenced the blood four times.<eos> Blood?<eos> !<eos> That's Booth right there.<eos> He was hit.<eos> I mapped the blood.<eos> There was a lot of it.<eos> And it's definitely his.
Madam President, joint chiefs of staff, Prime Minister Cho, it's truly an honor to be here in the Oval Office, though I wish it were under better circumstances.<eos> I just came back from a meeting with the world's top scientists.<eos> They're all dead.<eos> The virus, it got them all.
Sorry, I can't.<eos> I'm meeting a friend to see a movie, and I like answering those movie trivia questions they put up before the show, so I think I'm just gonna head out.<eos> I understand.<eos> Enjoy the film.<eos> I got to say, out of the 15 X-Men movies that I've seen, that was definitely top nine.<eos> Yeah, there was, like, 30 heroes and 40 villains.<eos> There are just too many people in these movies now.<eos> Text from my dad:<eos> "Please come and fix my iPad.<eos> Now it won't stop dinging."
It's been compromised.<eos> Dr. Vincent, the pathogen, it's airborne.<eos> The sickening!<eos> It's happening!<eos> Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, 'cause this is where the sickening first takes hold, so I need you to play that up. Are you sitting down?<eos> Why don't you get up out of your chair?<eos> Act like it's all taking over your body.<eos> The sickening!<eos> It's happening!<eos> The virus, it's eating my flesh!
Can we order the chicken with broccoli, please?<eos> Sorry this man is ordering chicken with broccoli.<eos> Please bring the good dishes you only serve to Chinese people.<eos> Of course.<eos> I can't believe they think that's what we eat in Taiwan.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> What is this super special spicy Szechuan chicken?<eos> Ramesh, why are you looking at that?<eos> You don't even eat spicy food.<eos> It is super special.
Do I tell you what to eat?<eos> I don't even like Chinese food.<eos> Well, why didn't you say something? We didn't have to come here.<eos> We could have gone somewhere else.<eos> I like this place.<eos> I took Mom once.<eos> She didn't eat anything, though.<eos> Yeah, because she doesn't like Chinese food.<eos> I like it.<eos> It's great.
I mean, it's a little bit of both.<eos> But I guess this is fun because I'm a really big fan of the band.<eos> Yeah, they were great.<eos> You know, I haven't been to a show in a while.<eos> The last concert I went to, actually, was The Silly Billies.<eos> The kids' bands?<eos> Yeah.<eos> To be clear, not a solo mission. I took my little cousin.<eos> Oh, and how was the show?<eos> It was awesome.
How did that happen?<eos> Iwaswalkingonthestreet, and I saw a man leave his car running and go into a store.<eos> For some reason, I felt like I had to get in and start driving.<eos> I don't know what came over me. I just had to do it.<eos> I got on the highway and took off.<eos> The car was a convertible.<eos> I still remember the wind on my face.<eos> For the first time in years, I felt like I could go anywhere, do anything. The possibilities were endless.<eos> Then something happened to the car. I don't know what.<eos> It started making strange noises, and the hood started smoking.
Yeah, we'll be fine.<eos> I'm sorry. The flight is closed.<eos> We can't let anyone on board.<eos> I just don't understand.<eos> I mean, the door's right there.<eos> Can't you just open it and let us in?<eos> We can't.<eos> So if Barack Obama was here and he wanted to get on the plane, there's no way you could let him on?<eos> Sir, President Barack Obama has his own plane.<eos> It's called Air Force One.
I still feel very terrible about what's happened, and I wanted to get you a gift to say I'm sorry.<eos> And it was a little hard 'cause we were in an airport, but I think I found something that really takes this whirlwind of emotions that I'm feeling right now and puts it into a physical object.<eos> I hope you like it.<eos> "Nashville rocks."<eos> It does rock.<eos> It does.<eos> And you rock.<eos> And I don't rock for what I did earlier.<eos> But, um... I hope you see this shirt and remember that Nashville rocks and you'll remember the times we had together that did rock and forget about the brief amount of non-rocking time we had.<eos> It is a XXL, which I'm pretty sure is not your size, but it is 100% cotton.
- I don't see anybody with red bones.<eos> No, it just means she's light-skinned.<eos> It's a thing we say in the black community.<eos> Oh, okay. So is Halle Berry a redbone?<eos> No, she's caramel.<eos> Look, here's the deal.<eos> She's straight, but lately I've been getting some serious vibes from her.<eos> Ooh, vibes that she wants to become a lesbian?<eos> No, vibes that she's curious about an adventure with Denise.<eos> It's not about changing a woman's sexuality, Dev.

No, we don't have any Indian sweets.<eos> We have some cheeses.<eos> Cheese?<eos> I don't like cheese.<eos> Any popadam?<eos> Popadam is Indian chips.<eos> Rachel, we brought you a small gift.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> I hope you like it.
Well, the sexual acts we like don't traumatize other people.<eos> Ha, but if they did, I bet you'd have some real internal conflict.<eos> Welcome to my world.<eos> All right. Stop making me weirdly kind of sympathize with you.<eos> You said you took a video of the incident?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you send it to this number?<eos> Whoa. So I'm texting you a video of him jerking off?<eos> This is weird.<eos> Come on, it is a little weird.
Again, man, sorry about the girlfriend. That sucks.<eos> Yeah, it's tough, man.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Long-term relationships are tough.<eos> You can't just expect a big roaring fire right away, right, you know?<eos> You can't put the big logs in first.<eos> You got to start with the small stuff, the kindling, right?<eos> And you add that, then you put in the big logs, and then you have a roaring fire, and that's a good relationship, right?<eos> But be careful.<eos> Sometimes kindling wood is hard to find, you know, good wood, so don't take it for granted.
- That dress suits you.<eos> - You think so?<eos> You brought something more practical?<eos> Of course.<eos> - Which way? - Here.<eos> Mind your head.<eos> It's sweet.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You like it? - Yes.
I didn't know you were coming.<eos> I just came for my things.<eos> Come in.<eos> I put them in this box.<eos> - As I was moving in...<eos> - No problem.<eos> Where's my ratings notebook?<eos> - Notebook?<eos> - The blue ring-bound one.<eos> Isn't it there?
This is harassment, Ms. Julian.<eos> My attorneys will be talking to you.<eos> Oh, no, Cher.<eos> You haven't seen harassment yet.<eos> You see, we have a dead man and need a suspect.<eos> And all the evidence points to you. Circumstantial at best but enough for us to get an arrest warrant.<eos> And since you seem to hide money for drug lords and dictators, I can't imagine what they'd do to you if we hauled you in on a murder charge.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Two days ago, when you found the body, the account disappeared. Every penny.<eos> It just vanished.
Hey.<eos> What's up, Angie?<eos> The money.<eos> The-the drives that Leelah took from Holt helped me to decrypt more of the tape.<eos> I found your money.<eos> I found all of it.<eos> Does anybody know about this yet?<eos> I Th- - I thought you should be the first.<eos> You're brilliant, Angie.<eos> Now get rid of it.
I found your money.<eos> I found all of it.<eos> Does anybody know about this yet?<eos> I Th- - I thought you should be the first.<eos> You're brilliant, Angie.<eos> Now get rid of it.<eos> You can do that, right, so that nobody ever finds it?<eos> Uh, yeah, but...<eos> Do it.<eos> It's not my money anymore, Angie, and there's so much blood on it, and as long as it's still out there, every crazy hacker's gonna try...
- That is all we need to know.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> On the other hand, I put your team together.<eos> - I know everything about you.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Especially if you knew Reiden was responsible for the very thing you wanted us to investigate.<eos> Our culpability is hardly a foregone conclusion.<eos> Oh, it will be when we're done.
Is that good?<eos> Only because you have no idea what power you truly possess.<eos> Many underestimate you, don't they?<eos> Well, at first, yeah, but then they either end up in my bed, or dead.<eos> Total lack of self-awareness will make very difficult to find the answers you seek, but we must try.<eos> Buena, buena, medicina.<eos> Buena, buena, luz divina.<eos> Drink. What's your poison?<eos> This will help you look into those places where answers might hide.<eos> It's called ayahuasca.
Drink. What's your poison?<eos> This will help you look into those places where answers might hide.<eos> It's called ayahuasca.<eos> Ayahuasca?<eos> You want me to take an acid trip?<eos> It's hallucinogenic medicine.<eos> Not a drug trip.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> Is it free?
Four more with Stevie.<eos> Various meetings, various places.<eos> Normally in his car.<eos> And this, with Stevie, four weeks before she died.<eos> Boss, Michael Bennigan, Bennigan Cars.<eos> Will only talk to River.<eos> Oh, didn't have your direct line.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> I was hoping to avoid a state visit.<eos> That's the problem with this country, it still bows down to its monarchy.
Cristal's? I don't think I know it...<eos> Kebab shop, near the Bethnal Green Road.<eos> Ah, well, no more takeaways.<eos> My cholesterol is sky-high. No, his paperwork is obviously false.<eos> You can see it pretty quick.<eos> They come in here with their fake IDs and their licences, and I send them away just as quick.<eos> Can I take this?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Most of the drivers have their own cars, y'know.<eos> I never saw his car myself, but I'm told it was a piece of shit.

Well, it stank of kebabs.
Filthy murderer!<eos> Wait, Clara.<eos> Look.<eos> This misdirection circuit of yours is remarkable.<eos> The cloaking device that hides the street, makes everyone look like humans.<eos> It's no device.<eos> It's the Lurkworms.<eos> Quite something, aren't they?<eos> The light is a telepathic field.<eos> It normalises everything you see, places it within the compass of your expectations, your experiences.
So, look, Ashildr got it wrong.<eos> What does it matter?<eos> Come on! - There's something about this tech...<eos> - Doctor, we don't have time!<eos> What is it?<eos> It looks like medical data.<eos> But it can't be.<eos> She's dead -- she isn't breathing.<eos> This thing is a stasis pod.<eos> If you're dead, it's a kind of fancy refrigerator.
As you come into this world, something else is also born.<eos> You begin your life, and it begins a journey... towards you.
The first rule of being interrogated is that you are the only irreplaceable person in the torture chamber.<eos> The room is yours, so work it.<eos> If they're going to threaten you with death, show them who's boss.<eos> Die faster!<eos> You've seen me do that more often than most.<eos> Isn't that right, Clara?<eos> Rule one of dying -- don't.<eos> Rule two -- slow down.<eos> You've got the rest of your life.<eos> The faster you think, the slower it will pass. Concentrate!
You have a pulse, yes?<eos> Pulse?<eos> - Let me do it.<eos> - I am checking it properly!<eos> This should work.<eos> This has got to work.<eos> What if one last heartbeat is all I've got?<eos> What if time isn't healing?<eos> What if the universe needs me to die?<eos> The universe is over! It doesn't have a say any more!
Hydroflax!<eos> All right, enough of this.<eos> The joke's over. - What joke?<eos> - Look at me.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm the Doctor.<eos> You'd better be, you've got an operation to perform.<eos> Here's the entry wound, just below the hairline.<eos> And... .. there's the projectile.<eos> It should have killed him straight off, but he's very strong.
Was it my voice?<eos> I'm a doctor. It's my job to notice things, like the waxing rash on your chest.<eos> But if I weren't treating you, I would never have known.<eos> Yeah. I was always teased for being too feminine.<eos> Hmm. Do your parents know that you're taking estrogen?<eos> My mom tries to be supportive, but she insisted I see a therapist.<eos> Mm-hmm. Then made me promise not to start hormones until I turn 17 and not to push for surgery yet.<eos> But...<eos> A few months ago, I started taking estrogen behind her back.<eos> Self-administering? It's just a pill.
Which we're not.<eos> - Are we?<eos> - Well, no. - No, we haven't been.<eos> - Right.<eos> But it turns out she only asked because there's this young girl who's seven months pregnant, and the couple who was adopting her little girl had some kind of change of heart, and so...<eos> So...<eos> Well, I told her we'd just started trying to get pregnant, and it wasn't the right time.<eos> But ever since I left her office, I've just had this feeling, and I've been thinking about whatever it was that made my parents decide to adopt when they did and then to choose me, and how once they did, my whole life happened, including you, like it was fate.<eos> And I don't know.<eos> It's a little girl.
You never stop.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> Why don't you give me a call if you... if you need a break?<eos> I'll do that, Jimbo.<eos> (Divya) And if you have any more questions, Your Highness, please, do not hesitate to call.<eos> (King) Thank you again, Ms. Katdare.<eos> Well, it sounds like your formidable father is coming around.<eos> Thanks to you, again.<eos> [sighs] How did I miss that incredible playhouse on my first visit?<eos> I had it delivered yesterday.
I thoroughly enjoyed myself.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> This was the best date I've had all month, actually.<eos> Well, I should go.<eos> Well, you're already here.<eos> Why don't you come in?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> What do you mean there's nothing you can do? You're the bank.<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course I've tried to contact Mr. McGuire on his phone, but it's inactive.
So ?<eos> You want me to whip something up for dinner...<eos> - Thanks. - The cat's on the sofa !<eos> Hi, Bengal !<eos> You're looking for love tonight.<eos> - Such a sweetie.<eos> - Well ?<eos> Let him stay for a few minutes then he'll leave.<eos> No, I was talking about the script.<eos> It's nice, I like the vibe: it tackles serious issues light-handedly.
You're really having a hard time with this, huh? Damn it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Daisy, hey.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm better.<eos> That pulsing sound was killing me.<eos> What pulsing sound?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> It was deafening.
- Yeah.<eos> I'm better.<eos> That pulsing sound was killing me.<eos> What pulsing sound?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> It was deafening.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Slow down.<eos> It holds the portal open.
So, I thought I had a dream. And I just believed that.<eos> The school told us that she went home.<eos> So, I just believed them and blamed Shizuko.<eos> I completely forgot about everything and held it against her for leaving without a word.<eos> The girls who have disappeared...<eos> They must be keeping their journals separately.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?<eos> It's taking time for other schools, too.<eos> Let's take this step by step.<eos> Once we receive the drug, it is up to me to decide how it is administered.

I'm coming to get you!<eos> What happened?<eos> Where the hell is everybody?<eos> Right here, asshole.<eos> One false move, and I will Second Amendment your brains all over this truck.<eos> Friends.<eos> Let's party.<eos> My brain!<eos> Good news, Lem.<eos> You won't even know it's gone.
My asshole hand.<eos> It came back, grew another me.<eos> Same shit, different day.<eos> Things were goin' fine with Amanda too, but that went south.<eos> All because of that goddamn book.<eos> No disrespect. You were the one who read from it.<eos> No disrespect Kelly.<eos> If you live in the past, you hurt the future.<eos> Now this Book has some freaky weird power.<eos> The sooner it's six feet under, the better.
I can't bear to be apart.<eos> Even for 5 minutes.<eos> Let's spend some time together.<eos> We could go away together.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - Really?<eos> Give me a hand.<eos> Come on, let's pack.<eos> - You've got a concert.<eos> - Well cancel it!
Where's Astrid?<eos> OK?<eos> This is my life.<eos> My flat. My wife.<eos> Stop that, Marc.<eos> You say I'm sick so you can live my life.<eos> - Play.<eos> - What?<eos> Go on. Play.<eos> Show us, if it's your life.
Good shit.<eos> Uh, thanks.<eos> That's our new hybrid.<eos> Oh that's okay.<eos> You keep that.<eos> So how'd you get into the z weed business anyway?<eos> I stumbled on this place.<eos> The cannabis was growing out of control.<eos> All I had to do was harvest it and get the word out.<eos> Needless to say it was a blockbuster product.
The last known coordinates for the CDC lab are as follows.<eos> The last known coordinates are Thirty four point<eos> Nine degrees west longitude.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Citizen Z?<eos> Citizen Z, are you there?<eos> Addy, do you copy?<eos> Damn it.<eos> How do we know if this stuff works?<eos> Well if the dosage is right, it should reverse the effects of the zombie virus.
Hey.<eos> Hey, how's she doing?<eos> It won't be long now.<eos> Did they find the cure yet?<eos> Not yet, sweetie. Well here.<eos> I managed to save some.<eos> Just have her chew on the leaves.<eos> They're not concentrated, so she won't overdose.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Honey, it's here.
- Not like Rick.<eos> Rick was out there.<eos> I was out there.<eos> We know, you don't.<eos> But if you don't learn, you will die, we will.<eos> I've been doing runs from the start, okay?<eos> - I know what it's like.<eos> - Have you ever had to kill people because they had already killed your friends and were coming for you next?<eos> Have you ever done things that made you feel afraid of yourself afterward?<eos> Have you ever been covered in so much blood that you didn't know if it was yours or walkers' or your friends'?
I clear.<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> Walkers, people, anything that gets anywhere near me, I kill 'em.<eos> I clear.<eos> Why?<eos> Because that's why I'm still here.<eos> Well...<eos> That's the biggest load of horseshit I ever heard.<eos> Here's your lunch.<eos> It's PTSD.
Eastman: To make up for it.<eos> Morgan: To still accept what we were.<eos> Hey.<eos> Eastman: To accept everyone.<eos> Morgan: To protect everyone.<eos> Eastman: And in doing that, protect yourself.<eos> Morgan: To create peace.<eos> Why do you have a cell in your cabin?<eos> Built this place with my wife a while before our daughter was born.<eos> It didn't have a cell back then. That was just the other side of the living room.
- Yes.<eos> Finish it. With the leak, it's average.<eos> I turned off the water.<eos> - Where is it from?<eos> - Below the attic.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> This place is such a pain!<eos> It's a bit out of the way, but I didn't think twice.<eos> - It's nice.<eos> - It's ideal for the kids.
When do you leave?<eos> Must you be so unpleasant?<eos> I just got here.<eos> And it's still my home too.<eos> Can you get water for the moats?<eos> When's the book out?<eos> You're interested in my books now?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I forgot I'm not qualified enough to talk literature.<eos> It won't be out.
Come on. Out.<eos> Come on. Get out of here. Ed, leave.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You're not going to take a shot--<eos> - Are you crazy? - Go! Just fucking leave!<eos> The prince had nothing to do with what happened to Laura.<eos> You kill a cop, and a thousand cops will take his place.<eos> You kill that prince, their god, you drive a stake right through their fucking hearts.<eos> You do that, and your life is over.<eos> It's already over.
Fuck, no.<eos> I'd like to recommend a schedule of 2-2-3.<eos> 24 Hour Fitness available across the street.<eos> Monday, Tuesday is Sarah.<eos> Wednesday, Thursday Len.<eos> Friday, Saturday, Sunday, you alternate.<eos> ...bathroom, convertible shower heads... The Los Feliz house now belongs to your kids.<eos> Uh, on-site... It's time for Zachary and Ella to get their lives back.<eos> No more chaos.<eos> When we look up at the sky, we're not seeing the universe as it is today but as it was hundreds, thousands, millions of years ago.
I...<eos> 'Cause I learned from an early age that things aren't as they seem.<eos> Because I want to make sure that what happened to my mom and dad never happens to anybody else.<eos> Because I can only do so much as a cop.<eos> You guys like cops, right?<eos> 'Cause I'm grateful... for the peace, safety, and stability this country offered to my family.<eos> Because...<eos> That's her.<eos> She's your mark.<eos> Because I believe in this country and what it stands for.
He can help himself.<eos> You know this isn't you or him, right?<eos> Please.<eos> Bye, Nimah.<eos> Hey. I found what was in the blind spot. It's a van.<eos> It must have been parked here for days.<eos> They left behind a rag possibly covered with chloroform.<eos> Someone must have grabbed her as she passed, pulled her in here, and drugged her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, a few minutes after Alex disappears, a cab pulls directly into the blind spot, it stops for about 20 seconds, and then...
I'm a pretty smart guy.<eos> Yes.<eos> And yet you chose two women who couldn't remember to keep their door closed, who jeopardized your career by locking me in this bathroom.<eos> So, no, I don't have questions.<eos> I have plans.<eos> Don't you dare help me.<eos> I know you think you have me in your cross hairs, Mr. Asher. But let me assure you no one's jeopardizing the twins or their training.<eos> And why the hell not?<eos> Because you're a good agent.<eos> You put your country first and your ego second, and when faced with ruining a good project and all the good it can do or keeping a secret and having your probation struck from your record...
That might be our next step.<eos> Simon, rewind the footage, please.<eos> Yeah, that's Fletcher.<eos> Yep.<eos> What the hell is he doing?<eos> What?<eos> Looks like Brandon left us a parting gift.<eos> Is it real? It looks real.<eos> Yes, it's real.<eos> Of course it's real.
Yeah, that's Fletcher.<eos> Yep.<eos> What the hell is he doing?<eos> What?<eos> Looks like Brandon left us a parting gift.<eos> Is it real? It looks real.<eos> Yes, it's real.<eos> Of course it's real.<eos> We just watched J. Crew put it in there! Come on.<eos> It can't be real.
You have to stop apologizing.<eos> I trusted you. That was on me.<eos> I made choices. That was on me, too.<eos> We both came into this with secrets.<eos> Me my father, you...<eos> Chicago.<eos> Nothing?<eos> I guess that is the Ryan Booth way, isn't it, or should I say Agent Booth?<eos> "Special Agent," if we're being technical.<eos> You know the only reason I didn't tell anyone your secret is because it wasn't mine to tell.
What's important right now is that you get somewhere safe.<eos> I just bought this phone.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> 35 minutes ago at a liquor store at 71st and Binford.<eos> You know where I am?<eos> Yes, and I convinced them to let me talk to you before -<eos> I can't believe you would do this. Just...<eos> Lincoln, just hear me out, okay?<eos> The ATCU has released your picture to law enforcement.<eos> It's everywhere, calling for your arrest.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, maybe you're right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Got to say, I was pretty surprised when I got your call.<eos> Eyes up here.<eos> Busted.<eos> Sorry. I appreciate you taking the time.<eos> Gave me an excuse to drive up the coast.<eos> Does she have a name?<eos> I love my car, but it's just a car.

I appreciate you taking the time.<eos> Gave me an excuse to drive up the coast.<eos> Does she have a name?<eos> I love my car, but it's just a car.<eos> And it's a him.
It's constant.<eos> I should just pick one.<eos> I, Elliot Alderson, am flight. I am fear. I am anxiety, terror, panic.<eos> Doesn't feel real.<eos> You should eat.<eos> Not hungry.<eos> I don't even know what I ordered.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't like the guisada?<eos> No, it's... It's good.
Just come on.<eos> Man 'N' Van is getting way too legit.<eos> It used to just be like drummers with their moms' Honda Odysseys.<eos> Now it's an actual company in Queens.<eos> I mean, the guys are literally men in vans.<eos> I'd buy morphine from you... If you could also get me Suboxone.<eos> Well, um, it's pretty much impossible to get Suboxone.<eos> My supplier doesn't have it.<eos> I saw this song live once.<eos> It was so rad.
Okay.<eos> Very good.<eos> Housekeeping done.<eos> Now, on to the real business.<eos> Has your dog ever eaten trash before?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, not...<eos> Not that I remember.<eos> Well, lucky for your bank account, the piece is small enough to pass on its own.<eos> Unfortunately, though, it's large enough to send her puking all over your apartment.
So, what, you're gonna just let me off scot-free?<eos> What do you get out of this?<eos> Earlier, I asked you a question.<eos> You never answered it.<eos> If I'm agreeing to testify in your case, then, yes, you know, I attended several meetings.<eos> Tell me about the one when they decided to ignore the leak.<eos> I'm... I'm not sure what you're asking.<eos> What was the meeting like when you decided this?<eos> I get it.<eos> You wanna know, like, what was it like?
Come on!<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Come on!<eos> You know, there are some terrific places for kids with special needs right here in Kansas City?<eos> Kathryn has done all this great research. Oh.<eos> That's really nice of you. Yeah.<eos> We are happy to do whatever you need us to do.<eos> We want to be a big part of your baby's life.<eos> You told them.<eos> It's their grandchild.
Daisy, do you copy?<eos> You're cutting in and out, sir.<eos> We've trailed the killer to the industrial park a half a mile South of you.<eos> Backup would be nice.<eos> On its way.<eos> Hold tight.<eos> Copy that.<eos> How did I let you talk me into this?<eos> I had a garage, workbench full of new tools, my own espresso machine.<eos> We got to figure out how this thing is finding Inhumans - and why it's killing them.
So from now on, will you just please stay put?<eos> That doesn't matter anymore.<eos> Why?<eos> 'cause I know how to get us home.<eos> This is where you came in.<eos> This is where I came in.<eos> All right, professor, I'm listening.<eos> The monolith creates a wormhole... a direct line from its location on earth to a fixed location here.<eos> You said the portal is moving.<eos> It appears to be moving, but it's the planet that's moving,
How'd you figure all this out?<eos> The planets, the math...<eos> - Scoliosis.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I had scoliosis as a kid.<eos> I had a small surgery to correct it.<eos> I was flat on my back for a few weeks, so to help combat the boredom, every night, my father would wheel my bed out and talk about the stars.<eos> Nice job, dad.<eos> So, this portal...<eos> How do we know it's not just a door that swings one way?

Uh, we're at a hospital in Harare.<eos> We're-we're actually testing the cure right now.<eos> Wait, where are you?<eos> Washington.<eos> Why are you testing it in a hospital?<eos> Listen, Chloe, um, something happened.<eos> Jackson got hurt.<eos> He's going to be fine, but-but...<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> It's clean.
Um, something going on out there.<eos> They closed half the city.<eos> Yeah, the Jap prince got shot.<eos> What?<eos> Your ma has been worried about you.<eos> You should, uh, you should go see her.<eos> Please try to rest, Your Highness.<eos> I have spent the entire night in this chair, Tagomi-san.<eos> I am rested.<eos> Your Chinese oracle... it cannot foresee every eventuality.
But my mission wasn't to retrieve a film or kill the Man In the High Castle, sir.<eos> My mission was to identify and gather intelligence on key figures in the Resistance.<eos> Then I found Lemuel Washington. I did that.<eos> I kept my cover intact.<eos> Lemuel Washington disappeared yesterday, along with his entire family.<eos> We don't know where he is.<eos> Oh, you failed, Joe.<eos> You failed.<eos> Do you know why you failed?<eos> You are one component in a complex machine that only works if every part does exactly what it's supposed to do in sync with the whole.
Otherwise GI Jane here is gonna put me down.<eos> Okay, okay,<eos> - what do you need me to do?<eos> - Just get me whatever first aid supplies you have around here, - okay?<eos> - Got it!<eos> - Sharpest knife you can find. - Ok.<eos> And a lighter to sterilize it.<eos> Grab some rope or electrical cord, whatever you got.<eos> The plane...<eos> Where is it?
And so is the plane.<eos> Agent Brannigan.<eos> I need to ask your guy a few questions.<eos> Cody Gibson.<eos> Well, you're lucky to be alive.<eos> - Are you a doctor? - Nah.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm just a guy interested in this device.<eos> It's called an electroporator.<eos> I don't know what the hell the thing does, but, uh, it was stolen from the zoo you broke into last night.
- Who are you?<eos> - I'm just a guy interested in this device.<eos> It's called an electroporator.<eos> I don't know what the hell the thing does, but, uh, it was stolen from the zoo you broke into last night.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, dude.<eos> "Dude"?<eos> No, don't "dude" me.<eos> I hate being "dude-ed."<eos> Clearly... these bad folks are sweet on this electroporator thing.<eos> So why don't you tell me where it is I can find them.
Where are you?<eos> Uh, we're at a hospital in harare.<eos> We're-we're actually testing the cure right now.<eos> Wait, where are you?<eos> Washington.<eos> Why are you testing it in a hospital?<eos> Listen, chloe, um, Something happened. Jackson got hurt.<eos> He's going to be fine, but-but...<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> It's clean.
This is all my fault.<eos> It's no one's fault.<eos> Mitch:<eos> Yeah, I... I'm the one who told you all That the leopard cub was the-the answer.<eos> I'm the one who said the mother cell was the key to the cure.<eos> It was just a theory.<eos> Not even a theory.<eos> Half a theory.<eos> Now's not the time For self-pity.<eos> It didn't work.
Listen.<eos> I figured it out. I know how to distribute the cure.<eos> Mosquitoes.<eos> - Mosquitoes?<eos> - Mosquitoes, all right?<eos> We inject a certain population of mosquitoes with the cure, we let them spread it to the other animals.<eos> Mosquitoes feed on every type of living species there is.<eos> I mean, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians.<eos> Meaning when they bite, they'll be passing it along.<eos> Not only that, but they lay their eggs in water, so it'll be spread to all sorts of water sources.
Money's great, hours are flexible, and I can go to school in the daytime.<eos> Wow.<eos> You go to school.<eos> - Yep.<eos> U.M.K.C. - Oh!<eos> MBA and I'm almost done.<eos> Wow!<eos> What's next afterwards?<eos> Well, I created a workout called "pas de pole."<eos> It combines the moves of pole dancing with the technique of ballet.

Go on.<eos> She just asked a bunch of questions about the coffeehouse, the other portraits.<eos> I just thought she was being friendly.<eos> Did she give you a cell number, mention where she was staying?<eos> - All of our interaction was in person.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> Oh, I got part of her license plate.<eos> Uh, Kansas K4X.<eos> The car was dark blue.<eos> Kansas plates. Means it's probably a rental.
And Mom wants to go find Dad in American states.<eos> And we need money for boat tickets and a bribe for the visas.<eos> Oh, my God. This shit is fascinating.<eos> Did you know there is such a thing as inherited trauma in your actual DNA?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> They did this study on bunnies where they give them electric shocks where they were smelling cherry blossoms and the bunnies' babies and their babies, the grandbabies, they were all afraid of cherry blossoms.<eos> That's a really mean thing to do to bunnies.<eos> So it's like the bunnies were in the cage watching while their grandparents got shocked?<eos> No, they weren't even born yet. They weren't even conceived yet. They weren't even a twinkle in the grandma bunny's eyes.<eos> - It was inherited in their DNA.
Is, uh, Holmes here?<eos> He got up early this morning to work on a project, but he'll be back soon.<eos> Kind of figured you'd be with him... all the time right now. Well,<eos> I'm not his sober companion anymore, so if he's gonna stay clean, he has to want to do the work himself-- he gets that.<eos> You two finally talked? Last night.<eos> It was good.<eos> I mean... he's disappointed and embarrassed.<eos> But he's not the same person he was when he got sober the first time.<eos> He believes in the program;<eos> he knows it can help him.
- It eliminates you as a suspect.<eos> - Why would I be a suspect?<eos> 'Cause you're with S.H.I.E.L.D. Okay.<eos> I ...<eos> I'm not sure I'm following.<eos> Lash is in S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> And with your help, I can prove it.<eos> I appreciate you showing me around like this.<eos> We built this module to help those in transition.<eos> It's made out of adaptive material, so it can contain all sorts of powers.

- Instinct?<eos> Look, I didn't want to hurt anyone, but I ... I didn't know what was happening.<eos> You killed all those people.<eos> How?<eos> - When did this ... when did ...<eos> - After Hawaii.<eos> Daisy's mom kept records.<eos> I was going through them for any insight, for research.<eos> And I found a book.<eos> It had all these names of Inhumans.
Thea, whatever's going on with you, the League, they'll know what to do.<eos> Why are we not telling my brother?<eos> Because you're not the only reason for us going to Nanda Parbat.<eos> What happened?<eos> The ambulance didn't make it to Starling General.<eos> We tried to get the paramedics on the radio, and then we got a 911 call reporting this.<eos> Machin, he, um...<eos> I don't really know how to describe what he did to them.<eos> I'm not sure what that symbol means.<eos> It means anarchy.
Not here for the investigation?<eos> He said he's personally close to you and wanted to help.<eos> Idiot...<eos> Who's helping who?<eos> I think he's after a kickback thinking it's a corporate case.<eos> Poking around for a slice of the pie.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I got this.<eos> This country treats businessmen like criminals.<eos> Isn't it run by the taxes we pay?
Good to see you.<eos> You too.<eos> - That is quite a horse.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I had no idea that you were a Civil War reenactor.<eos> Well, it's a passion of mine.<eos> My family took part in the real thing, and some of us give a damn about history, unlike my brother.<eos> - May I? - Oh.<eos> See that house?<eos> It's beautiful.

I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Open up.<eos> Well... who cares?<eos> I'm past it.<eos> Son of a bitch forbids me to be on his property except for these three days, when we commemorate our ancestors who mustered to march on Fredericksburg on this very spot.<eos> Maybe you both need a little time.<eos> It's been seven years.<eos> That ship has sailed.<eos> Jim, you do have a fever.<eos> You think it's my hepatitis?
That's love. [laughs]<eos> I might have spoken too soon about that maturity thing.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's not you. It's, uh, it's Ken.<eos> I think I know what he's smelling, and it's not love.<eos> I'm glad you find my ralphing so humorous.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I don't.<eos> But I do know why it's happening.
What did you do to her?<eos> Saved her life.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You in there?<eos> Cassandra?<eos> Party's over, everyone.<eos> Here she comes!<eos> Congratulations, daddy.<eos> Murphy! Do your zombie voodoo thing!<eos> It's not working!
What the hell am I supposed to do?<eos> I think you already know.<eos> Well, there's our little space traveler.<eos> We were just about to open up the portal.<eos> I thought you might want to come and see for yourself.<eos> Anyone who goes to that planet will die.<eos> That thing on the other side drives people mad.<eos> Well, that's certainly an interesting theory.<eos> Here's another.<eos> It wants to come back.
You better hope there are therapists in prison, because if I can't stop her from testifying, that's where you're gonna end up.<eos> Mike Ross, what brings you down to my office?<eos> I'm here with a proposal from Louis.<eos> You're here because Louis wants something from me, but he's too afraid to ask. He's not afraid.<eos> He just sent me here because he figured you might hear it better coming from me.<eos> Well...<eos> McKernon Motors wants to make an investment in battery technology.<eos> We'd like to quietly negotiate with Tanaka, and we need your help getting them to sign this. And why would I do that?<eos> Because it's huge money, and now that contingent compensation is back at the firm, it's huge money for you.<eos> And the last time Louis came to me with an offer like this, it was bullshit.
The world's changing.<eos> Deal with it.<eos> You were there.<eos> Did you see it?<eos> What's it like?<eos> I did see it.<eos> But I can't really describe what it looked like.<eos> It's more how it felt, which is old and pained, as if it once had great power but lost it.<eos> And the entire planet is a wasteland.<eos> How that came to be, I can't really say, not in any scientific terms, but my sense and certainly Will's heartfelt belief was that the creature is the one responsible... that it caused the desolation.
I'm not leaving.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> One minute left.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> You may have to hold this thing open.<eos> In case you-know-what shows up instead of our peeps.<eos> Anything other than our people comes out, we give May the high sign and blow it to hell.<eos> Same if Hydra gets in here.<eos> It's open.
I don't fully understand what's been going on here.<eos> But, er...<eos> This is what happened.<eos> Stop staring!<eos> 'They came from Triton.<eos> 'This is Chopra.<eos> 'Bit of an attitude, in my opinion.'<eos> Calm down, pet!<eos> Well, it's ridiculous!<eos> That thing's meant to be a lethal fighting machine and it just moons around like a love-sick puppy! I could hear you ranting
Doesn't make sense.<eos> None of this makes any sense.<eos> Hello again!<eos> Thing is, you see, this message, this testament, it wasn't just my alibi. It was my plan.<eos> There are no spores. No infection.<eos> The Morpheus process remains the same.<eos> An electronic signal that affects the sleep centres of the brain.<eos> Changes them.<eos> An electronic signal that's contained in this recording.<eos> There it is.
- Stay no more than one hour.<eos> Even I can't guarantee Mr. During's safety longer than that.<eos> Okay.<eos> One hour.<eos> And dominating our program today, as it has dominated headlines across Europe, is news of this shocking document which suggests German intelligence is working with the CIA to bypass Germany's privacy laws.<eos> Our guest is the woman who published the document-- The dissident American journalist Laura Sutton. Welcome.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Can I correct one thing right away?<eos> The document doesn't suggest a relationship. It absolutely proves it.<eos> It details every aspect of the arrangement, even its budget.
Thanks.<eos> Can I correct one thing right away?<eos> The document doesn't suggest a relationship. It absolutely proves it.<eos> It details every aspect of the arrangement, even its budget.<eos> It's quite shocking.<eos> So you're not surprised that the Chancellery is scrambling to distance itself from the affair?<eos> I'm not.<eos> But I think your security services have a lot to answer for, too.<eos> Plus, I only saw the one document.<eos> It could just be the tip of the iceberg.
- I wouldn't be surprised if we found similar operations... - Don't we need a warrant?<eos> - ...in other countries, aimed at skirting...<eos> - Just do it. ...national privacy regulations.<eos> Germany is by no means the first country to spy on its citizens, but the BND was smart about it.<eos> They outsourced the dirty work to the CIA.<eos> Every paper and TV channel.<eos> And all over the web.<eos> I told you - she would do it. - Shh.<eos> Who was the source of the leak?<eos> Was it from inside German intelligence?
Like I said, it usually just goes away on its own.<eos> My dad, he used to take cold baths for it.<eos> [accented] "I will drown it out," he'd say.<eos> In a vampire voice?<eos> No, in a Greek accent.<eos> He's Greek.<eos> Greek, of course.<eos> Of course what?<eos> Familial Mediterranean fever.<eos> It's an inherited disorder that presents with recurring fever and inflammation.
Of course what?<eos> Familial Mediterranean fever.<eos> It's an inherited disorder that presents with recurring fever and inflammation.<eos> That's what this is?<eos> I don't know, but we'll do a genetic test to find out.<eos> Sit up for me?<eos> Ah. - Got it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Deep breath.<eos> It can also cause fluid to build up in your lungs which is the crackling sound that I am hearing.
- That's a whole lot of up.<eos> - We can make it.<eos> The question is, will I come down?<eos> _<eos> This was my village.<eos> My home.<eos> Look what's become of it.<eos> My house was...<eos> Or maybe...<eos> Maybe it was there.
And now I'm going to kill you.<eos> That power was never meant to be a weapon!<eos> Then you shouldn't have turned it into a sword.<eos> Nimue.<eos> How?<eos> When I cast the detection spell. Yes.<eos> I drank from the Grail.<eos> You didn't tell me what it feels like to be strong, Merlin, to be immortal.<eos> Nimue, you let me watch you die!<eos> I'm sorry about the play-acting, but it was my last chance to remind you what death looks like.
It's too late.<eos> I'm so sorry, Killian.<eos> But I did not have a choice.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, there has to be some other explanation. Aww.<eos> Are you finding the truth hard to swallow?<eos> Here.<eos> Have a look at the sword.<eos> A glamour spell.<eos> It was there the whole time right under your nose, and you didn't even see it.

$25 million?<eos> Robert, after fees, that's less than $70,000 per person.<eos> [laughs] Then what do you suggest we counter with?<eos> I suggest we counter with a trial.<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> You don't go to trial.<eos> You turn up the pressure, and then you settle.<eos> Going to trial is turning up the pressure.<eos> The second we finish opening arguments, that offer is gonna triple.<eos> Look, I've sat across the table from these two four times in the last six years, and when they say this is their best offer, it's their best offer, and we're recommending it.
♪ Get another piece of pie for your wife ♪<eos> ♪ Everybody wanna know how it feel ♪<eos> ♪ Everybody wanna see what it's like ♪<eos> Don't tell me he wasn't in here either.<eos> He was in here, all right. What happened?<eos> Did the settlement fall through?<eos> No, it didn't, but it should've.<eos> They gave us a shitty offer.<eos> Robert's ready to take it.<eos> Come on, if it's really that bad, why would he take it?
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...<eos> Special Agent with the FBI.<eos> You joined the federal police.<eos> The city sold the building to developers.<eos> It's scheduled for demolition next month.
Go back.<eos> Back to whatever shadow you crawled from.<eos> Get off him!<eos> Crane.<eos> Stay with me, stay with me.<eos> Secrets kill.<eos> There's nowhere for us to run, Lieutenant.<eos> This creature will surely find us.<eos> We must find a way to defeat it. A weakness we can exploit so we can escape unscathed.<eos> That's it... it wants secrets.
Less violent.<eos> Oooh, I'm sorry booboo.<eos> I got carried away.<eos> Don't you worry your pretty little head.<eos> Doc.<eos> I don't feel so good. You got anything?<eos> You're just nervous, papa.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're gonna love that baby no matter what.<eos> Even if it looks like you.
Forgive me.<eos> Grace to you, and peace.<eos> I'd feel a whole lot better if they at least tried to kill us.<eos> Only in a messed up apocalypse was that the right thing to do.<eos> I see something!<eos> That is not a head.<eos> Yeah, but sometimes that happens, right?<eos> Sometimes they get turned around and they come out feet first, right?<eos> Uh yeah, but that's not a foot.<eos> That baby's not waiting to get pushed out. It's pulling itself out.
Yeah, but sometimes that happens, right?<eos> Sometimes they get turned around and they come out feet first, right?<eos> Uh yeah, but that's not a foot.<eos> That baby's not waiting to get pushed out. It's pulling itself out.<eos> Here she comes!<eos> Zombies.<eos> Congratulations, Daddy.<eos> You did good, Mommy.<eos> Well what is it?<eos> It's a girl.
Can I?<eos> Look.<eos> Ten fingers.<eos> Ten toes.<eos> Uh, Murphy.<eos> Isn't she cute?<eos> Cover Addy and 10K.<eos> Murphy!<eos> Do your zombie voodoo thing!<eos> It's not working!
I'll take you to the Gortner Bridge, just north of the city.<eos> Road block on the East side keeps things pretty quiet.<eos> After that, where you headed?<eos> East, West? Shut up.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Nothing worse than a blabber mouth that won't shut up.<eos> It's kinda like back in the before.<eos> I had this brother in law<eos> Does this thing actually run?<eos> I swear it ran as soon as yesterday.
The two Witnesses will seek to stop you.<eos> Bury your new power deep into their hearts and bring me back what I desire:<eos> a destiny that favors the strong and destroys the weak.<eos> You're certain this Nelson Meyers is the man we seek?<eos> Profile points to a white male, mid-20s, loner type.<eos> Someone who had access to the building that the victim was killed in; and Nelson's the only one who didn't show up for work today.<eos> How does turning this man into a murderer further Pandora's agenda?<eos> Everything she's thrown at us has some kind of personal connection.<eos> She knows our past, our secrets. There's definitely a pattern;<eos> just haven't figured it out yet.
Get the rifle.<eos> Nelson?<eos> Don't make this worse!<eos> You're interrupting us.<eos> Release her!<eos> Nelson, please...<eos> Shut up!<eos> How will harming her make you any less of an outcast?<eos> Huh? You need to back off.<eos> Fight what that weapon is doing to your mind. Before it completely consumes you.
Thank you.<eos> You two start in the girls' bedroom.<eos> I shall try my luck with the young Miss Saffron.<eos> This reminds me of our room when we lived on Lindbrook.<eos> But without the boat window.<eos> Boat window?<eos> Come on, you remember. The boat window.<eos> I guess I was too young.<eos> The circular window above my bed?<eos> We used to pretend it was a porthole. we were on a boat going somewhere else.
For once, would you just go with it?<eos> Yes, I think you might be right.<eos> Crane.<eos> Crane.<eos> It's over.<eos> How now?<eos> Yes.<eos> The dentist.<eos> Uh, when he arrives, fetch my timber plank to put it in my teeth to bite for the pain.<eos> It's over there. By my codicil!
Look, I promise, I won't let anything bad happen.<eos> Joe, in this world, that is not a promise you can make.<eos> ABBIE: Sorrywecouldn'ttake thetour.<eos> CRANE: Itwaseverything the Founding Fathers dreamt of.<eos> BOOTH: Great.<eos> A musty old basement, huh?<eos> A basement is never just a basement with the Masons.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Okay... that symbol there has no notch, but this symbol has a notch.<eos> Its placement calls to mind a keyhole. It's not just rounded. It's a few centimeters deep.
We'll have to burn Sleepy Hollow to the ground.<eos> There can be only one reason why Washington would deploy such volatile ordnance right under the Capitol.<eos> It was a trap... built for a very specific threat.<eos> And since Howe was their commander, anyone that survived would try to rescue their master's body.<eos> And, in doing so, would be faced with their only weakness,<eos> Greek fire.<eos> Yeah, Brennan said it was just some kind of napalm. We'll get our hands on some.<eos> Why would that pose a threat to the town?<eos> Because Greek fire is far more sinister than your napalm.<eos> It cannot be extinguished by water or by sand.

Previously on Sleepy Hollow...<eos> Tell me what you tried to smuggle past customs.<eos> An artifact.<eos> I believe it holds the key to our future as Witnesses.
- How so?<eos> - Judge Chrysdale is a history buff. Loves anything to do with the Revolution,<eos> Civil War, so on. You quote a little Jefferson, uh, offer your apologies, the whole immigration snafu goes away.<eos> Fine.<eos> But the charges made against me remain a farce, Lieutenant. Flagged as a risk to national security.<eos> - For transporting my own property.<eos> - You smuggled ancient artifacts into the country and got caught.<eos> This guy is-is-is very straightforward.<eos> You just play the hits and be charming, we'll get out of here by lunch, at which time you can tell me all about your... date with Zoe last night.<eos> There's nothing to tell except it was an unmitigated disaster.
No name's given, but it does sound like her.<eos> Well, read on, Lieutenant.<eos> "I entered the camp to find it gripped by a pall of fear and paranoia."<eos> Miss Dixon?<eos> Your reputation precedes you.<eos> As does yours.<eos> I hope I'm not too late. You placed these to ward off the evil that threatens this camp?<eos> A folk remedy to keep insects at bay.<eos> Tea tree oil, cucumber peel, cinnamon vanilla and citronella.<eos> Yes, I, uh, know it well.
Wait, look.<eos> These are summoning spells.<eos> Some in Latin, some in Norse.<eos> Wait, Norse like those berserkers that came after Jenny?<eos> Nevins must have used this to summon them.<eos> Now I'm curious.<eos> What other creatures could this raise?<eos> I like where you're headed with this.<eos> Wait, so that book can pull monsters out of Pandora's box?<eos> If it can, it may be very handy indeed.
How about that guy?<eos> Yeah, he looks suspect to me.<eos> No, Toothless!<eos> No, bud!<eos> It's the sound. That song... that's what draws the dragons in.<eos> - Songwing.<eos> - What?<eos> That's what we should name it. Now?<eos> Really? You want to name it now?<eos> We need to call it something.
- What happened to the chicken? Forget the chicken!<eos> We gotta get out of here!<eos> Is anyone falling for this?<eos> I don't know. I haven't seen him this freaked out since he found a leech on his...<eos> Okay, I'm gonna stop you there.<eos> Okay, fine, let's just check this out so we could all go back to sleep.<eos> Okay, when this giant beast rips us limb from limb, I will expect a full apology from each and every one of you.<eos> And a handshake.<eos> No, you won't be able to shake hands 'cause your limbs will be gone. Shh.<eos> No! It was here, and it was huge.
You're looking a little different there, Guster.<eos> - Yeah, I'm growing a beard.<eos> - Really?<eos> Let me see.<eos> Even Ruff has more hair on her chinny-chin-chin than that. [snap] Ow!<eos> Hey, what's that thing?<eos> You see these spots?<eos> Some sort of sun sword?<eos> I'll take that.<eos> No, Gustav, it's not a sun sword.

[snap] Ow!<eos> Hey, what's that thing?<eos> You see these spots?<eos> Some sort of sun sword?<eos> I'll take that.<eos> No, Gustav, it's not a sun sword.<eos> It's the Dragon Eye, and it's very old and very fragile.
These footprints are fresh.<eos> We should be right on top of it.<eos> It's like the beast can sense us coming, and then it changes direction.<eos> A truly worthy adversary.<eos> We have got to be getting close.<eos> Ah, I don't think so.<eos> We've been here before.<eos> Look at the broken branches on this side of the trail.<eos> The beast has doubled back on us.<eos> Wait, you think it knows we're hunting it?

- Yes, but I don't remember much.<eos> It was so long ago.<eos> Just a few pictures in my mind.<eos> I remember my father's hands.<eos> They were rough, like sandstone, but so gentle.<eos> And I remember the smell of his wooden shield.<eos> I don't think I was supposed to play with it, but he let me anyway.<eos> And this.<eos> He gave me this horn.<eos> I don't know if it means something, but whenever I look at it, I think of him.
- You're not hearing me.<eos> No, you're not hearing me.<eos> What do you think is gonna happen when word gets out that I was offered the one thing that every associate dreams of, and I turned it down?<eos> Nothing's going to happen.<eos> Because you're going to put your mind to finding a good reason with as much enthusiasm as you did bullshitting your way into this job in the first place.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - You know what it is.<eos> Portfolio of business I want you to take to Pearson Specter for me.<eos> I'm not doing it. This is an opportunity for you, Jack.<eos> No, Daniel, it's an opportunity for you, and I'm not interested in carrying your water.
I'm taking mommy out for the day.<eos> Long as this serial killer's in the news, cops are gonna be all over this city like a rash, so for now, no feeding on tourists, and don't even think about going near the locals.<eos> So what, then, puppies and bunnies?<eos> Josh, you can talk to our contacts at the blood banks and hospitals.<eos> Let them know you'll be coming by.<eos> For the rest of you, keep everyone else in line.<eos> All we got to do is ride it out.<eos> Klaus and Elijah will get it sorted out, and we'll be back to business in no time.<eos> Somehow I doubt that.<eos> Your current dilemma will get worse before it gets better.
Perfect.<eos> The shirt, I mean, of course.<eos> But your story was cute, too.<eos> By the way, the first one was fine,<eos> I was just enjoying the show.<eos> Do you need anything before your visit to Parliament today, Your Majesty?<eos> Another pair of knickers.<eos> Simon's monument is nearly finished.<eos> It's very nice.<eos> It represents him well.
- What's the deal?<eos> You don't have to like me.<eos> I don't like you, but you have to work with me to stop Zoom and Doctor Light.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> I guess we'll see, won't we?<eos> I guess we will.<eos> One more thing... you said you were going to re-task the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite?<eos> To scan for solar emissions, yeah, we're up and running.<eos> I'd like to examine your program.<eos> I want to see if it works.

What if I become like him?<eos> Cisco, I don't think any of us would become evil if we all of sudden got powers, even if they were from Dr. Wells.<eos> Yeah, maybe you're right.<eos> I should have said something.<eos> That's my fault. I'm sorry.<eos> Well, you can be sorry later, because right now, we have to use your powers to find Doctor Light.<eos> Cisco, your abilities, how do they work?<eos> I get these feelings sometimes, these vibes, visions of the breachers when they come to this Earth.<eos> I just... I'm not sure what triggers it.<eos> Sometimes it just happens.
Let him take the cash.<eos> He's out of your life, and you're calling the shots.<eos> You win. I'm just supposed to victory dance my way into an ambush with Carlos?<eos> I had to send him first.<eos> He gave me no choice.<eos> Look, all you have to do is wait until he empties the well, and then take what's yours.<eos> Take the tanker.<eos> He gets what he deserves, and you get your heart's desire.<eos> - The keys to the kingdom.<eos> - One problem. You don't even know where it is.
And my name is Kisa.<eos> Where's Richard?<eos> He's off to a better life.<eos> I gave him exactly what he wanted.<eos> You manipulated him.<eos> You got in his head.<eos> And you didn't do the same?<eos> Don't fight it.<eos> Let my venom fill your veins.<eos> It will keep you still.
I'm okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What did he offer you?<eos> - Let her go, okay?<eos> - Not now, Scott.<eos> He wants the well for himself.<eos> And he betrayed everyone for it.<eos> If this thing finishes pumping, Malvado gets everything he wants.<eos> This blood doesn't belong to you or him or anybody.<eos> - It belongs to culebras like Scott.
It's where I store all my treasures and wares.<eos> Wow, concise, to the point.<eos> Who knew he had it in him?<eos> [Johann] Which reminds me of the first time I was labeled as "concise"!<eos> He was a young man, - very ugly, I actually...<eos> - Johann.<eos> - Yes? - Focus.<eos> Is there anything else?<eos> As a matter of fact, there is one ship you must avoid at all cost.<eos> It's called... the Reaper.
This'll make the cops write it up as a looting by the korblocks.<eos> - That's horrible.<eos> - I hear you, man.<eos> Cops are racist.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> You're alive.<eos> Thank god.<eos> Can you help us?<eos> Our planet was taken over by some kind of... entity.<eos> It absorbed the minds of our people.
Oh, hey.<eos> You're alive.<eos> Thank god.<eos> Can you help us?<eos> Our planet was taken over by some kind of... entity.<eos> It absorbed the minds of our people.<eos> We didn't notice until it was too late.<eos> The people it takes over, they look like your friends, your family, your leaders, but they're not themselves anymore.<eos> They're part of... it.<eos> Then how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you?
Jerry, stop, please, okay?<eos> We weren't even supposed to be down here.<eos> If we confront him about this--<eos> Oh, my god! I love this.<eos> I love that this is how far you will go for him.<eos> You want to go upstairs and cut carrots and watch a Lifetime original above a [bleep] alien dungeon!<eos> Your relationship with your father is psychotic.<eos> Oh, listen to you relish the idea that my genius father is a bad person.<eos> Step out of your ego for a second and look at this thing;<eos> it's a monster.
Keep Summer safe.<eos> And if you continue to turn your flooble cranks, I will bring you other great alien advancements.<eos> - Hey, uh, let me ask you something.<eos> - Yes? Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new?<eos> All of them.<eos> That's their job.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, energy-wise.<eos> Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box?<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> It's top secret.
You bastard!<eos> Much obliged.<eos> - What the hell is happening?<eos> - This is healthy, trust me.<eos> You're my battery, mother[bleep].<eos> That's all you are.<eos> I made you.<eos> Your microverse sucks!<eos> And your miniverse is the size of a [bleep] lobster tank!<eos> It's whack!
- Sir!<eos> Hold you fire!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government.<eos> Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live side by side in peace.<eos> We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption.<eos> Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs.<eos> What do we do about the space car?<eos> Leave it alone.<eos> I mean, what did it really do, anyways?
- Ew! What the hell?<eos> Jesus!<eos> There's flies in my ice cream.<eos> Presidential decree--<eos> All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs.<eos> - What the [bleep] did you do, Summer? !<eos> - It was your ship!<eos> - Your stupid ship did it!<eos> - Don't blame my ship!<eos> - It melted a child!
[ Door beeps ]<eos> Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.<eos> You hear me, Jerry?<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> - Whoa!<eos> - Ooh, watch out for that stuff.<eos> It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send you into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.
They melt in your mouth, Morty.<eos> They're delicious. Dad, I can't believe you're explaining alien cereal.<eos> - We're worried about Jerry.<eos> - Well, you're 39 years too late, or, you know, however old he is.<eos> Is he -- ls he 50?<eos> Jesus Christ, Beth, is -- ls Jerry 50?<eos> Where am I?<eos> Relax, Mr. Smith.<eos> You're in an alien hospital.<eos> I mean, to you, it's an alien hospital.
Lil' Bits!<eos> You hungry?<eos> Come on down.<eos> Lil' Bits.<eos> Eat some fucking shit, you fucking stupid bitch.<eos> [ Chuckles ] Just kidding.<eos> You've got some time to kill before the procedure, so I assume you'd like to, uh, use your penis one last time.<eos> Here's my computer. It's got the alien internet on it.<eos> Here's some porn. And there's an alien towel.<eos> I actually got that on another planet. So it is an alien towel to me.
- Yes.<eos> I have to find somewhere to hide.<eos> Well, you can hide with us. Rick?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Do you think we could take --<eos> - W-What's your name?<eos> - Arthrisha.<eos> Could we take Arthrisha up in the ship and, you know, just wait out the purge?<eos> Oh, Morty, how can I refuse after all you've done to blackmail me?<eos> Your vehicle -- ls it from the gods?
's "Feels Good" plays ] - [screaming] - ♪ It feels good ♪<eos> ♪ Yeah ♪<eos> ♪ It feels good ♪<eos> ♪ I feel it all in my soul ♪<eos> ♪ It feels good ♪<eos> Geez. Wow, Morty. Now you're getting into it.<eos> Never expected that out of you.<eos> All right, uh, let's go find my ship.<eos> Hey, hey, Morty, Morty.<eos> There it is down there -
Jeez, all day with the...<eos> Listen, kiddo, forget about them.<eos> You wanna check out this cool new game I got?<eos> You have solitaire?<eos> On your computer?<eos> Yep. It only took 12 disks to install it.<eos> Wow! Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.<eos> I bet it's still in his old office. Unless somebody else moved in.<eos> Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember?<eos> Because it was under tap dancing star Savion Glover's office.
I've been working on this novel.<eos> I wanna be remembered for something.<eos> All I ever did was that stupid sitcom that got ripped away from me.<eos> But now, with this book, I have something good.<eos> I'm telling you, this book is gold.<eos> -It's my Kazzaz-terpiece. -Whoa.<eos> I want you to make sure it gets published after I die.<eos> You can count on me.<eos> To life, huh?<eos> It'll kill you.
It's a shame that Arafat walked away from the table in 2000.<eos> I mean, obviously there's no panacea, but a two-state solution with an emphasis on human rights feels like a place to begin.<eos> - My question is for Diane Nyu... Nyu...<eos> - You won't get it. Ask the question.<eos> Your book went to some revealing places.<eos> Were you worried at all that it would hurt BoJack or his career?<eos> That's a great question.<eos> I'd also like to know the answer to that, Diane.<eos> Well, I think the truth is worth pursuing, no matter what.<eos> BoJack's not perfect. There are other celebrities who have done much worse things and it hasn't hurt their careers.
We're in.<eos> It's too late to turn back now.<eos> One of us isn't going to come out of this alive.<eos> Why do you all keep saying that?<eos> Why can't we all assume we're gonna make it out alive and go from there?<eos> Alan, we've got enough problems without worrying about your imminent death.<eos> Can't we just all shut up and do this?<eos> Why does everything have to be a big, complicated mess?<eos> Like, look at this Thomas Kinkade painting.<eos> It's simple. And serene. And... pleasant.
Come...<eos> Carolyn. - My name is Princess Carolyn.<eos> And as I held that baby in my arms, I knew I had been given a second chance.<eos> A chance to finally make things right.<eos> And this time, I was gonna win... the race of life.<eos> That was actually good.<eos> - We're doing a full awards push.<eos> You should clear your schedule for the next year.<eos> Buckle up, buddy, this is the year of Secretariat.<eos> But it wasn't Secretariat. And it wasn't me.
There's no Sabine here.<eos> I have a meeting with her.<eos> It was arranged through her lawyer, Jonas Hollander.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I'm not leaving until I see Sabine.<eos> Sabine's under house arrest.<eos> But the BND keeps sniffing around, trying to find something to use against her.<eos> To send her to prison.<eos> Put your phone in here.<eos> It blocks the signal.
In the moments before you asked me to flee with you, I saw your brother.<eos> You must only think of him as the monster that he truly is.<eos> I see him as the monster that he is.<eos> Those remains used to be my mom.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm gonna find out how this happened.<eos> Even if we figure out who killed this guy, it's a vampire.<eos> I think you know exactly where my medallion is.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's in here.
I do wish it was under better circumstances.<eos> We all face a common threat... A prophecy warning that my siblings and I would all fall within a year.<eos> I fear my sister already has.<eos> Only as a precautionary measure, I assure you.<eos> Interesting.<eos> You see, I would have called it an entirely unnecessary measure.<eos> We need to unite to prevent the prophecy from coming to pass, and since any alliance is impossible without honesty, let us begin this evening's proceedings by formally acknowledging your clandestine alliance.<eos> Now, gentlemen, before...<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Lucien, please.<eos> Let's not ruin the dinner before it begins.
You've never given me a gift after a case.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Come to think of it, you've never even congratulated me, Which means you're actually here because, Oh, my god, you miss me.<eos> - I did... Not miss you.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Do you want to come over tonight?<eos> We can watch sleepless in Seattle.<eos> - Do you want your gift or not? - That's it?<eos> My gift looks a lot like a folder.<eos> It's a case.
A contract that explicitly states that any product Alyssa Lang developed during her employment<eos> Is the property of our client.<eos> Unfortunately that contract is unenforceable.<eos> It is unless I woke up in russia this morning.<eos> Your honor, I have here a copy Of Alyssa Lang's birth certificate.<eos> She may have signed that contract, But it isn't binding because she was only 16 at the time.<eos> What?<eos> Your honor, I know this man, And that document could have come from anywhere.<eos> Get it verified by the labs at Quantico.<eos> All it's gonna prove is that Alyssa Lang Had no legal capacity to sign.
If I hadn't seen it myself, I never would have believed it.<eos> And why is that? Because I'm a grinder?<eos> Here's the thing, Jack.<eos> When you took on Harvey, You pitted the grinders against the rainmakers, And that was a good move,<eos> But you want to move to the next level? We need to be both grinders and rainmakers.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> What are you saying? I'm saying that we need to revisit<eos> The compensation agreement.<eos> No way.<eos> Why would I do that? Because when we get this business, It will be worth a fortune to us.
Whoo, that's impressive, and fast.<eos> How much would they sell for?<eos> Hundred thousand.<eos> Hundred thousand dollars?<eos> Per lens.<eos> Everything ok?<eos> Yeah, my phone just keeps acting up.<eos> I'm going to restart it.<eos> Uh, this is an autonomous communications device.<eos> Which is great, uh, except for the fact that it spontaneous explodes.
Tell me.<eos> Listen, I'm starving.<eos> Can we find a place to eat and talk about it there?<eos> So...<eos> So...<eos> You know I'm bipolar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And that I take lithium.<eos> Which is good for me.<eos> It keeps me... safe and sane.
Want to tell me why the Russians give a shit whether you're alive or dead?<eos> Because they don't want me to see something in the documents those hackers stole from you.<eos> Saul Berenson smuggled a thumb drive out of the building and then met with Otto Düring.<eos> There's only one person Saul would go so far out on a limb for.<eos> She's dead.<eos> What if she's not?<eos> Look, I agreed to do it your way.<eos> The hiding out, the pills.<eos> I said yes. Because I wanted to help you.<eos> Well, it didn't help you. It didn't help anyone.
Likewise.<eos> My office is this way.<eos> - Where'd you fly in from?<eos> - Washington.<eos> I spent a couple weeks at home, with family.<eos> - Husband and kids?<eos> - Uh, father and sister.<eos> Ms. Stevens.<eos> Your Honor, I-I thought our meeting was tomorrow.<eos> It is.
Well, what cable was that?<eos> Was from Baghdad Station.<eos> Apparently, Samir Khalil was demanding to speak to me.<eos> He said he had important information. He was adamant about it.<eos> "Information"?<eos> That Ahmed Nazari was alive.<eos> Allison, listen, did you, did you have any reason to question the intel he was providing?<eos> No.<eos> No, his stuff was good.<eos> It always checked out.
They'll find out soon enough.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> Catch us up.<eos> We're coordinating with the Federal Police to secure likely targets-- airports, train and bus stations, major public buildings, including synagogues and church community centers.<eos> What about watch lists?<eos> High priority individuals are being rounded up.<eos> But with the timeframe, we're not very optimistic.<eos> To my ears, the 24 hours sounded like a soft deadline.<eos> We can hope, but we have to prepare for the worst.<eos> Meanwhile, we're analyzing the video for clues as to where and when it was made.
Do we know?<eos> A Berlin cell.<eos> Some released from Plotzensee prison, apparently.<eos> Quinn fell in with them.<eos> Fell in? How?<eos> No idea.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> He was in no shape to go anywhere.<eos> Well, Dar's the one who saw him last.<eos> And-and the video-- when was it made?

Sidon?<eos> It's in Lebanon, in the south.<eos> How long have you lived here?<eos> This flat?<eos> In Berlin.<eos> Three years, ever since I was offered the teaching position at the university.<eos> And you're not at all conflicted?<eos> About what?<eos> It's just... this country seems to have taken you in, treated you well.<eos> This benevolent country you talk about, Germany, it supports the State of Israel unequivocally.
I'm gonna run 'em against the database and see what I can find.<eos> Uh, here, our victim.<eos> His name's Dr. Jeffrey Shore.<eos> He's a biochemistry engineer here at Vaughan Pharmaceuticals.<eos> This is the second dead lab tech in two weeks.<eos> That ain't a coincidence.<eos> Yeah, and like the other tech, he had just stolen a serum from their storage cooler.<eos> - Really?<eos> What kind of serum?<eos> - It's called Cortexin.

Watch this.<eos> He has amazing muscle memory from all those years of signing books.<eos> It's a reflex.<eos> I have hundreds of these.<eos> I'm gonna make tons of money when eBay comes back.<eos> I'm gonna be damn rich!<eos> Nice.<eos> Maybe you could do your mind thing and help him finish his next manuscript.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Is it any good?
No. He just had a perma grin on his face the whole way here.<eos> Ok, now I'm worried.<eos> He said he had some big announcement to make.<eos> Oh, my God, wait, where is it?<eos> Why aren't you wearing it?<eos> Wearing what?<eos> Uh... What is that you wanted to tell us?<eos> And why are you telling us here?<eos> Remember this office? Yes. This was Sebastian blood's campaign office.<eos> And now it's mine.
United. That's what this city used to be.<eos> It's what it can be.<eos> It's what it must be again.<eos> Now, I know that I'm not the obvious choice for mayor. I'm--I'm not a politician.<eos> I signed away my family's company.<eos> I didn't even graduate from college, although, in my defense, I did go to four of them.<eos> I certainly don't have a traditional background for leadership, but I can tell you this-- after five years in hell,<eos> I wanted to save my city.<eos> And with your help, I can.<eos> With your help, we will restore our home to the shining beacon we know it can be.
Good.<eos> And some music.<eos> Rachmaninoff's concerto no. 3, I think.<eos> Now, lieutenant, you needed my attention?<eos> I was going to say I should act as pilot.<eos> If I wished to be chauffeured, you would already be in this chair, lieutenant.<eos> If you wish to make yourself useful, take the comms and make sure our arrival is discreet.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> This area is dangerous.<eos> It's been an insurrectionist stronghold for years.
Unbreakable materials grafted to our bones, gene therapy.<eos> Muscle density increased, enhanced skeletal and muscular growth.<eos> Of course, we had no clue what we had to live through first.<eos> Replay the message, déja.<eos> Message from admiral Ysionris Jeromi.<eos> Chief medical officer, research station hopeful.<eos> Catherine, I wish I had better news.<eos> Further analysis has yielded zero alternatives to mitigate the risks in your proposed hypothetical experimentation.<eos> But I understand the theoretical framework, Catherine, and admire the imagination.<eos> But! Hope it is in fact a hypothetical study.
Proximity detonator at 100 meters.<eos> Fire.<eos> Three, two...<eos> Power us back up.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Sensors coming back on.<eos> All longsword interceptors vaporized.<eos> Covenant ship intact, sir.<eos> No.<eos> It is moving off, though, sir.
I'm open to suggestions.<eos> Now you're listening to me?<eos> It's your city, Oliver.<eos> All right.<eos> That's new.<eos> Yep, comes in handy.<eos> We can't use that serum on Barry.<eos> That's up to him, isn't it?<eos> If Barry wants to stop Zoom, this is what he needs.<eos> Jay said it could hurt Barry.
Before... The other angels, they hate you.<eos> And what about you?<eos> Do you hate me?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We took a vote -- democracy in action -- and...<eos> Hannah's doing the job.<eos> I won't give you Sam and Dean.<eos> Sure you will.<eos> We're gonna hack your brain.<eos> Whatever's in that house, I can taste the power radiating from it.
Hannah's doing the job.<eos> I won't give you Sam and Dean.<eos> Sure you will.<eos> We're gonna hack your brain.<eos> Whatever's in that house, I can taste the power radiating from it.<eos> Oh, Jenna!<eos> Oh!<eos> You scared me.<eos> That thing...<eos> It's old...
So, that was the last of the neighbours, just like the rest.<eos> Dean?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> So you're saying we got nothing.<eos> No one saw anything unusual going on at the house the day the baby disappeared.<eos> If this is truly the Darkness we're talking about, it's more of a time bomb than a baby.<eos> Yeah, but it is still a baby, right?
I'm hungry.<eos> No.<eos> Mind the undergarments, Samuel.<eos> Imported, of course.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Where is what, dear?<eos> The book!<eos> The Book of the Damned.<eos> The codex is in there, but the book is not.<eos> So where the hell is it?
I'm gonna need Insulin.<eos> Yeah, well, one medical emergency at a time.<eos> Is it bad?<eos> It could be worse.<eos> I'm gonna start sewing, and you're gonna tell me what the hell's going on here.<eos> Yesterday morning, I got an alert... That a pending interagency database search generated a result.<eos> Right away, I knew it was weird because the search was two years old, and it was instigated by a former agent named Kate Beckett.<eos> What was the search for?<eos> The document it uncovered was a just-declassified electronic memo, heavily redacted.<eos> From what I could tell, it detailed a meeting between a federal official of some kind and senator William Bracken.
- Put it down.<eos> - Okay!<eos> Walk.<eos> Lady, I have never worked so hard to kill one person in my entire life.<eos> Okay, so, did you guys get lost, or were you just waiting till the last possible second to save us?<eos> Little distracted in there.<eos> You got a fully stocked bar, satellite TV.<eos> We ordered some Sushi on your credit card, so I hope you don't mind.<eos> We got to get the phone.<eos> It'll tell us who's been giving them orders.

There are places in this world as old as the world.<eos> Places of Nexus, draw bad people to them.<eos> This island is such place.<eos> It's no accident that you're here.<eos> Let me guess--<eos> "Do not enter."<eos> More like, only for the pure of heart.<eos> That's not you, mate.<eos> There you are, my pretty girl.<eos> How do you know it's a girl?
Yeah.<eos> Good work.<eos> Onsite.<eos> We're clear for entry.<eos> All right, Felicity, what's next?<eos> We need a sample of the chemical.<eos> With it, Ray can unscramble the DNA markers and we can have a shot at IDing some of our Ghosts.<eos> Where do we find this thing?<eos> According to their recently hacked computers, second floor, northwest corner.<eos> It's a yellow liquid.
Jaw's not right.<eos> That's what I keep telling people.<eos> Would you give us a minute?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> Nice meeting you, too.<eos> Hey. Hi.<eos> I thought that you were going to come by the campaign offices to go over the finances.<eos> I thought that meeting was on Wednesday.<eos> It is Wednesday.
That's how it's supposed to feel when you love someone.<eos> Believe it or not, he's lost himself in you.<eos> And you'll find yourself in each other.<eos> Just don't get in your own way.<eos> And don't ruin something that most people never get.<eos> 'Cause if you do, trust me, you'll never find another guy that hot again, who cooks.<eos> Thanks.<eos> He is definitely hiding something in there.<eos> Latin building.<eos> Before the city went to crap, it was touted as the most secure building on the west coast.
I'm impressed, especially considering how late you got home last night.<eos> Where's Oscar?<eos> I don't know. Damon never showed up.<eos> I suppose I've taken the notion of trust for granted lately.<eos> Lorenzo, would you mind terribly if I had a moment alone with Valerie.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Just some family business.<eos> I spent yesterday with Stefan, learned all about your little tryst in 1863.<eos> We were children.<eos> It was...

Julian knew I could never tell Lily what he had done because that would also have exposed my lies.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She never would have forgiven me for having an affair with her son.<eos> I didn't want to live under Julian's thumb, so that night as we crossed the Atlantic, I drew myself a bath, laced my tea with laudanum, and went quietly to sleep...<eos> But I died with Lily's blood in my system...<eos> And by virtue of pure happenstance, I became the first heretic.<eos> You don't know how sorry I am... About everything.<eos> Maybe you never will.<eos> So what does a rock that makes you see screaming people have to do with reincarnation?<eos> I don't know, but I've read that book already cover to cover, and it's a waste of time.
The story is that some natural gas leak made it all uninhabitable, but there's been so many rumors, whispers, and just strange things happening in the night, unexplainable things.<eos> Ok.<eos> Tone it down, "Blair witch."<eos> What'd you bring me, huh?<eos> Full-spectrum light, emf meter, and a thermal camera, courtesy of uncle Fred's graduation money.<eos> Look how hot you are.<eos> You're hilarious.<eos> Ok, so this thing's supposed to beep if there's some spirit or something supernatural present.<eos> You get this thing off an infomercial or something? Wait.<eos> It's working.

Wait.<eos> It's working.<eos> Whoa. It's creepy but kind of awesome.<eos> It won't open. No lock.
Aah! Amanda.<eos> Amanda.<eos> Ryan, help.<eos> It's ok.<eos> I'll get help, ok?<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Much better than those blood bags.<eos> No screaming, please.<eos> How do you know how to work that device?<eos> I don't, but if these two could, I'm sure it's idiotproof.
We have a burial to go to.<eos> My girlfriend thinks her outfit has to be fashion forward.<eos> I disagree.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Uh... Help us, and perhaps I can find a small stool for you to stand on.<eos> I feel silly.<eos> I'm sure you're beautiful, my love.<eos> Nobody wears this anymore.<eos> You wore than dress to queen Victoria's funeral.<eos> It's stunning.
Rough day.<eos> Not to be the bearer of bad news, but it's about to get rougher.<eos> So I own the Salvatore house?<eos> It's pretty brilliant, really.<eos> They drain the vervain from your blood, compel you to sign the deed, compel to not invite Stefan and Damon in, and compel you to forget any of it ever happened, and, bingo, the house is an impenetrable fortress,<eos> and vampires can't rescue Caroline. Great, so the only way to break the seal is for me to die.<eos> Bon, please tell me that that's not the plan.<eos> Well, what do you think about letting me use magic to stop your heart?<eos> - So you're gonna kill me?<eos> - Temporarily. But won't it reset when I wake up?
Ok.<eos> I just came to get a book that I left here.<eos> This one.<eos> Uh, actually, I'm just gonna do my research here if that's ok with you.<eos> My office is your office.<eos> Great.<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Ok. Didn't think so.<eos> So, uh, Enzo found some sword in Oscar's car and is under the impression it will kill Julian.
Our story may have ended in tragedy, but you have a chance to see that your friend Alaric's doesn't.<eos> Valerie, the test was negative.<eos> Test again.<eos> Lily: Don't!<eos> Oh, thank God you're all right.<eos> You must have been given such a scare.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Damon drove a sword into my chest, knowing it would be the same as driving it into yours.<eos> Of course...<eos> He was under the impression it would kill me.
That's what you wanted, right, make her a little jealous?<eos> Maybe a little.<eos> Anyway, I got what I came for.<eos> Have a nice night.<eos> Her nose just started to bleed, and...<eos> And then that started.<eos> Oh, here.<eos> Take my blood.<eos> Drink.<eos> It'll heal you.
Now.<eos> Twins are the lifeblood of the Gemini coven.<eos> If a pregnant mother is in danger, then the transfer is our magical failsafe.<eos> It's rarely used but used nonetheless.<eos> Ric, tell me that this isn't crazy.<eos> My wife, who died months ago, just looked me in the eyes and said good-bye to me.<eos> Why the hell not?<eos> Because I don't want you to get your hopes up for something that's insane.<eos> I need your blood.<eos> Now put it here... Indonesia, farthest geographical point from Mystic Falls.

Indonesia, farthest geographical point from Mystic Falls.<eos> Your progeny are, obviously, made up of your DNA.<eos> If they're alive, the blood will travel along the map.<eos> Once it's in the proximity of the babies, the map should ignite.
Heh heh!<eos> - How'd Stefan take it?<eos> - Oh, you know, totally supportive and just wanted to make sure that I was ok.<eos> At least, that's how I'm hoping it goes when I tell him today.<eos> What are you doing here, Lorenzo?<eos> Oh, looking for the self-help section.<eos> Seems I've developed, um, feelings for someone with terrible taste, and yet... I can't seem to shake her.<eos> I need to get something for Nora and Mary Lou's anniversary.<eos> Nora used to read this poem over and over again when we were trapped together.<eos> I believe it was called "The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd."
Yeah. I just refuse to believe that you care so little about your own flesh and blood.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Death doesn't erase all the crappy things she did, Stefan.<eos> If anything, it lets me care about her even less.<eos> Oh. Hello, boys.<eos> If you'll just pardon me a moment.<eos> What are you doing? I seem to have misplaced my cellular telephone.<eos> These things have a way of, you know, jumping out of your hand and just... Scurrying off.<eos> Oh. Stop looking.<eos> Here it is.
Hmm. What do you mean by "we"?<eos> Well, you lost your mother, and I lost the love of my life.<eos> She meant nothing to you.<eos> She meant everything to me!<eos> Heh heh heh.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you remember this sword?<eos> When you, you know, drove it through my chest?<eos> You didn't quite have all the pieces together, though, did you, literally?<eos> See, when a vampire is stabbed through the heart with, uh, the completed sword, it acts as a magical conduit, transferring their spirit into this... Particularly nasty stone, and the purpose of the stone is to punish vampires like you boys.
Wait. That was you sane?<eos> Well, it was, but, uh, now...<eos> These have been dark days for me.<eos> So then they followed him to Ridley Park, old Saybrook, and finally Sunbury.<eos> They need to leave immediately.<eos> Julian is not one who enjoys solitude.<eos> Those towns are places he used to live.<eos> Then I remembered what my old life looked like.<eos> And I...<eos> I realized... I mean, it was a good life.
I was two seconds away from tearing their heads off.<eos> They were jerks.<eos> They deserved it.<eos> Oh, I've needed this all day.<eos> Yeah, you and me both.<eos> Do you think this is ok for the babies?<eos> - Caroline. - I'm serious.<eos> What if blood is like alcohol?<eos> What's if it's bad for them?<eos> Look. If it's good for you, how can it be bad for them?
Please go relax.<eos> I'll be up shortly with your next dose.<eos> No, no.<eos> Let's try to avoid another episode.<eos> No, no.<eos> I will not relax until Niklaus is buried alive.<eos> We need to get back the serratura and lock them all away in a pit of fire.<eos> It's being taken care of, darling.<eos> Here.<eos> The sister has been researching the medallion since it's been in the Mikaelsons' possession.
I'll walk the rest of the way. Sir, the doctor said no.<eos> I can't be seen in a wheelchair. Someone will notify the press.<eos> I'll walk.<eos> How was it?<eos> It was fun. I'm sorry if I worried you.<eos> I was already worried.<eos> I know who you are and all that comes with it.<eos> I was just hoping I could add a little quiet to your noise.<eos> Quiet is difficult for me right now, Beck.<eos> The noise is... how I breathe. It's what gets me through the day.
Make him understand who he is.<eos> Lord, I, I should like to baptise him again.<eos> Well, if he arrives at Heaven's gate as Uhtred, they may wonder what's happened to Osbert.<eos> Do what you must, but do as I ask.<eos> Lord.<eos> We were kings here once, boy.<eos> Kings of all the land between the Rivers Tuede and Tine.<eos> And we should be kings again.<eos> Yes we should, but it doesn't matter what they call us, so long as they obey.<eos> Our ancestors took this land, and it has been strengthened with our blood and bone.
Leave her.<eos> She is to live.<eos> Some of these young ones can come in useful.<eos> Father, there's the boy I spoke of.<eos> The one who almost killed you?<eos> You're leaving him with me?<eos> I've never seen a man get the better of you yet.<eos> Cut me some chicken.<eos> Careful, the blade is sharp.<eos> It can kill a man.
I am the Ealdorman of Bebbanburg.<eos> You are? I am, I own lands to the north.<eos> How long have you been the ealdorman of these lands?<eos> Your father chose to fight us.<eos> And is now... Dead.<eos> He, he... He was not fond of me.<eos> I now understand why my son spared you,<eos> Uhtred of Bebbanburg. You are a warrior.<eos> Have some ale.<eos> Drink it, lots of it.
Hey, Uhtred of wherever.<eos> How about you teach me how to use a sword.<eos> We don't teach slaves how to fight.<eos> That tongue of yours will be your death, boy.<eos> Now, get back to work.<eos> What does the play involve?<eos> We built a hall in the gorge.<eos> I'm the mistress and Uhtred is a warrior.<eos> Not a servant?<eos> It is a game.
(U HTRED) I was born an ealdorman of England.<eos> Uhtred, son of Uhtred of Bebbanburg, welcome to the Christian world.<eos> Heir to the Northumbrian lands of Bebbanburg.<eos> - You have your stone, amber? - Yes.<eos> Our ancestors took this land and you will die for it if needed.
The arseling here is barely a man, and you expect him to teach me how to fight?<eos> Leofric, I expect him to teach you nothing.<eos> Whip him with staves in practise, by all means.<eos> Thank you, Lord.<eos> But our lesser men, if they can know what a Dane knows, fear can be expelled with knowledge.<eos> Regardless how sharp their teeth.<eos> You didn't eat tonight.<eos> I'd only throw it up.<eos> A year?<eos> It starts with a year and becomes a lifetime.
Before the two walls meet, the first three rows of men act together to create a tall shield wall.<eos> First row crouches lower, protecting the lower body and legs.<eos> The second row reaches forward, protecting the upper body and the third row leans in, protecting the head of all rows of men.<eos> Shields up.<eos> Shields together.<eos> Shield wall!<eos> I like it, arseling, I do.<eos> Now kill the bastards!<eos> The wealth isn't mine.<eos> It belongs to Lord Ragnar, the fearless.
-My son? Yes, Lord.<eos> You have a son.<eos> Handsome little man he is.<eos> Looks like his father.<eos> I should really take your balls for this desecration.<eos> Yes, Lord. No, Lord...<eos> Please.<eos> I don't care for you, your wife, your children, nor your whore.<eos> Lord, he made me do it, with the promise of a coin.<eos> It was false promise, Lord, I have no coin.
With an altar of gold, they say.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> - (UHTRED) They belong to Oswald.<eos> Their mother sends them hoping to shame me for killing their lying, thieving father.<eos> I see her plan is working.<eos> They're not the first to lose a parent.<eos> They'll live.<eos> Food is good, Mildrith.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm pleased you like it.
Every man stand where he is.<eos> No one move.<eos> You!<eos> Stay where you are.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Lower your hood.<eos> I said, lower your hood.<eos> Aethelwold.<eos> I merely want to come with you. To be part of your adventure.<eos> I wanted it to be a surprise.
Which is also my property.<eos> If you're in need, my father's house will always be your house.<eos> How is Lord Odda faring?<eos> - Well, I hope.<eos> - Frail.<eos> He's still very frail. The blow would have killed many a man.<eos> (ALEWOLD) Take consolation, lady, that should your land be confiscated, it is the church that'll benefit.<eos> Where is it buried?<eos> Where's the silver?<eos> Where is it?
Your wealth.<eos> - My wealth for my life?<eos> - Your wealth and your shadow queen.<eos> Useless bitch. She saw victory.<eos> (SKORPA) Where is the silver?<eos> If I tell you, you'll kill me, and I would rather you remained poor.<eos> You have my word, as a warlord, you will be spared.<eos> Where is the silver?<eos> Speak or you will die.<eos> It is buried. In the hall, beneath my throne.

You have the tits, I'll have the arse.<eos> She's mine.<eos> You are here for the silver?<eos> It is beneath this seat.
The only way to free Hiro Nakamura is for her to sacrifice herself.<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> What happened?<eos> To free the Master of Time and Space, I must overcome one final obstacle.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?
Now get me Jerry Myers on the phone.<eos> You want me to do that, I will.<eos> But you've always said we're a family, and families keep things like this in the family.<eos> I'm not sure if congratulations are in order, but since we have no other choice,<eos> I'm going to choose congratulations.<eos> - You saw the memo? - I did.<eos> You're making partner.<eos> No, Rachel, I'm not. What do you mean?<eos> Jessica told me to turn it down.<eos> Said it would draw too much attention to me.
And if I am gonna beat him, I'm gonna do it with honor.<eos> And I will.<eos> You're on a suicide mission.<eos> Oh, we'll see.<eos> But my stakes... are me.<eos> Yours are far greater.<eos> Do you really think you can win on your own?<eos> I know I can.<eos> Here's the thing about confidence, Miss Swan...<eos> It's great at starting a fight, not so great at finishing one. Good luck.
- It's not sleight of hand if you're gonna use CGI.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just... That's insulting to anyone who's ever done any kind of close-up magic, so...<eos> - And that you were the most useless person who ever lived.<eos> And now... you feel better?<eos> - It's the original version, the Danish version, that it's, like... it's dark.<eos> It's, like, 100 times better because the Danish people, they're... they're, uh... they have a dark soul.<eos> I mean, I get it.<eos> - Get...?<eos> - You're a kid, and your whole life's ahead of you, and you have these notions... about what life is... and... what it could be.
No, look, just tell all the dudes that Rachel will be here, dressed as a sexy nurse.<eos> Because, look, if Rachel shows up, all the guys will show up.<eos> If all the guys show up all the girls show up-- it's simple math.<eos> Dude... seriously, is this where you think the keg should go?<eos> I mean, where else would I put it?
Do you know how bad it is for children's endocrine systems?<eos> Come on! It's Halloween, all bets are off.<eos> Besides, I mean, look at this as, uh, an insurance policy, right?<eos> I mean, last year, we ran out of candy, you started passing out raisins, and then we ended up getting our house egged.<eos> Whoa!<eos> What is that?<eos> Is that a brain? I am making edible props for Christine's Halloween party at school.<eos> Last year, Olivia's mom brought plastic eyeballs, which were completely unrealistic, so... I concocted some brains out of agar gelatin and food dye.<eos> Oh, so that's, like, edible!<eos> Look at that, it's like Jell-O! Mmm!
Is this the man you were expecting to find?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> Oh, well, then that's a good thing, right?<eos> No.<eos> It is of the utmost consequence, far worse than I thought.<eos> This... is General William Howe, commander of the British forces during the War for Independence.<eos> A blackguard, a man as famed for his cruelty as his strategic mind.<eos> Uh, well, according to this, he was buried in Twickenham, England.<eos> And yet the facts say otherwise.<eos> Dr. Brennan, we have stumbled upon a mystery of the highest magnitude, and I shall not rest until it is solved.
And you did this two weeks ago?<eos> She said it was transformative.<eos> You know, she saw her sister, and her sister told her to let go of all her fear.<eos> That... is what we were celebrating.<eos> It was science... at its most powerful.<eos> Science?<eos> And was it science that made you dig up the skull of a Redcoat general to help you?<eos> I didn't dig anything up.<eos> Sarah had this weird idea that thing had power, but I didn't buy it.<eos> You know, I just thought it was... like a rabbit's foot... for good luck.
More secrets revealed?<eos> These... are remodeled puncture marks on Sarah's ilium.<eos> Consistent with bone marrow donation.<eos> A procedure more suited to family members, if I'm not mistaken?<eos> You are not.<eos> Sarah's sister died of cancer.<eos> These marks indicate Sarah may have given bone marrow in an effort to save her.<eos> Perhaps the untimely death of her sister compelled Miss Lippmann to seek out the hereafter.<eos> (scoffs) The hereafter doesn't exist.<eos> It's nothing but a fiction we created to fight the biological inevitability of death.
There's a significant possibility of recovering epithelial cells.<eos> But if Howe had a porcelain tooth, where is it now?<eos> Porcelain.<eos> The coffee cup.<eos> I-I have all of these pieces of a broken coffee cup.<eos> The porcelain could have easily gotten mixed in there.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, go over that piece again here.<eos> Its hue doesn't match the others. SAROYAN:<eos> You're right.<eos> And it's got a pointed cusp and single root like a canine.
You mean it's not right for Mike?<eos> Oh, come on, Mom.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Two years ago, you wouldn't have had a problem with something like this.<eos> Well, it's not two years ago, and this is how we both feel.<eos> So I'm just asking you to respect my wishes because we have so much more to go over, okay?<eos> I'm telling you it's Cutie Pie Cosmetics.<eos> Joan's ready to retire.<eos> No one gives a shit about Joan Walsh's business.<eos> It's Nader Communications.
You're not in reality.<eos> Jack, she did it for me.<eos> Even if I wanted to go with you, I couldn't.<eos> He's got something on you, doesn't he?<eos> This conversation is over.<eos> Harvey, what the hell?<eos> I just to notification of a tender offer.<eos> They're coming after my company.<eos> I know, that's why I'm here. So they sent the big guns to fight because it's a hostile takeover?<eos> I'm not here because it's a hostile takeover.
Rachel, that is a bad idea.<eos> Your mom can get over some spat about the size of your wedding, but she's not going to get over this.<eos> All I know is, my mom loves me no matter what.<eos> I understand that, but Rachel, if you do this, you're going to be burdening your mother with a secret that she has to keep from your father for the rest of her life.<eos> How did you two get in here?<eos> You should us you can get to us. Now you know we can get to you.<eos> Then you must be here to hand me the keys to McKernon Motors.<eos> Actually, we're here to inform you that McKernon Motors is going private.<eos> That's all well and good, but there's the matter of my tender offer, which is up to the shareholders and my 20% is voting to take it. Good for you.<eos> We're pretty sure the other 80% is gonna want to take our offer, seeing as it is ten dollars per share higher than yours. Bullshit.
Just wondering what color to paint the walls.<eos> I've never been partial to red.<eos> Instead of commenting on my wall color, why don't you go back to your office?<eos> Lick your wounds.<eos> What wounds?<eos> I'm about to win.<eos> You have a funny definition of win.<eos> Since we just blew your best offer out of the water.<eos> Here's a copy of my new offer.<eos> It'll be in "The Journal" tomorrow.
Okay?<eos> Okay, so, look at this tattoo.<eos> Starts with 399, has a bunch of letters just jumbled up in between, and then it ends with seven.<eos> Do you see that?<eos> Who here knows what a Vigenere cipher is?<eos> Put your hand down.<eos> It's a polyalphabetic substitution code.<eos> Yes, awesome.<eos> A Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text based on the letters of a key word.<eos> And unless you have the key word, it is next to impossible to decode.
Here, um, come with me.<eos> I... I don't think that's what it is.<eos> It's just...<eos> all of this is new, and we're just trying to find our footing.<eos> I understand that.<eos> But this is on my body.<eos> I should be out there with them.<eos> Do you know what a tangram is?<eos> No.<eos> It's a... it's a dissection puzzle consisting of flat geometric pieces, known as tans, which are put together to form elaborate shapes.
No, she moved back to Brazil.<eos> Where's the rest of his crew?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Isabella...<eos> - Really, I don't know!<eos> I thought you said you didn't wanna go back to jail.<eos> Omar has a boat.<eos> He said he'd take me out on it sometime.<eos> He lives on it, I think, in Manhattan.
So see her tattoo here?<eos> The two leaves?<eos> It's an oak and a maple leaf.<eos> What's the significance?<eos> That's what I couldn't figure out until I realized I was focusing on the wrong thing.<eos> So see how the two leaves have a dark, shaded section where they intersect?<eos> It's where they overlap that matters.<eos> Well, looks a little like a bird.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So I knew I'd seen this image before, and I ran a search and found it's part of a logo.
Or is the other way around?<eos> We is me, me is we?<eos> Anyway, it's called "Resorbed Twin."<eos> And, uh, the album goes on Bandcamp next week.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - That's great.<eos> Right?<eos> That's great!<eos> So, Brian, can I hear it?<eos> Uh... it's embargoed right now.
How would you help? Tell me.<eos> He wasn't trying to be mean; that's not my dad.<eos> But he was saying a lot more than he meant to.<eos> Help?<eos> I could barely take care of myself.<eos> Other people had careers.<eos> Me?<eos> I was a temp.<eos> Manchester-Reid Bancorp is the eighth or ninth biggest bank on Wall Street, depending on how you measure.<eos> Everyone who works here just took a sexual harassment seminar... it's a liability thing... and then they signed a form acknowledging that they went.
There are two other people at the bank using NZT.<eos> Eli's income went up by a factor of ten when he was taking those pills.<eos> So did this guy's, Jay Winston.<eos> And this guy's, Adam Honeycutt.<eos> Adam Honeycutt.<eos> Jay Winston.<eos> Those are the other people using NZT.<eos> Winston has listed a hotel in SoHo as his address.<eos> He's living out of a suite.<eos> It's about two miles from here.
They tell us to get to a hospital.<eos> Yeah, well, I can't do that, so...<eos> You want me to coach you through patching a bullet wound?<eos> Why would you expect me to do that?<eos> Because I'm innocent.<eos> Where is the bullet?<eos> Is it in your leg, still?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, I think it just grazed me.<eos> Is the blood bright red or is it dark?
And what do they want with me?<eos> They didn't say.<eos> Maybe you're the alien cure too. Great.<eos> Just great.<eos> So how long have you been in contact with these Visitors?<eos> At first,<eos> I was like everyone else. I saw the lights in the sky, but I had no idea what they were.<eos> And then one night, I was about to be killed by Zs.<eos> I was ready to die.<eos> And then the light came and it spoke to me and protected me.
10K, don't let them get him!<eos> Murphy, don't do it!<eos> Don't go!<eos> They're gonna probe you for sure!<eos> And not in a good way!<eos> Let's go.<eos> This way.<eos> This way.<eos> Be careful that thing doesn't blow.<eos> Is it alive?
Let's go.<eos> This way.<eos> This way.<eos> Be careful that thing doesn't blow.<eos> Is it alive?<eos> I can't tell.<eos> Help him.<eos> Please help him.<eos> Oh, oh god.<eos> What if it can't breathe our air?
Speak softly? Carry a big log?<eos> Except for this stick is used for peaceful conflict resolution and communication.<eos> Doctor Gould<eos> Gideon, please.<eos> I know it's funny. We don't really get many visitors here.<eos> Gideon was a<eos> I'm sorry... Is a world renowned expert in corporate communication and conflict resolution.<eos> We were all at his seminar in the hotel when the outbreak happened.<eos> We would all be dead if we didn't have a way to communicate.<eos> It's a way to build trust.
Don't get too comfortable.<eos> These are shark-infested waters and those fake tits won't keep you afloat for long.<eos> I didn't kill the King of England, Ted... ..but we both know you did.<eos> I'm only the King of England.<eos> Walk away.<eos> I'll do it myself.<eos> A breakfast fit for a king.<eos> What is it? - For me?<eos> - Don't get over-excited.<eos> It's a going away present.
- Oh, yes.<eos> So, now, listen. I love a grand entrance more than anyone, but it's obvious to me that you were just using that girl to get under your mother's skin.<eos> But you have a responsibility to the public.<eos> If you're going to take a stance, do it for the right reasons.<eos> What happens now?<eos> Now we wait for the police to arrive.<eos> I don't suppose I'll ever be coming back here.<eos> I think that's fairly safe to assume.<eos> My life was never in here.<eos> It was always out there.
Your Majesty, I respect your right to defend the Crown.<eos> But I would hope that you would also respect the fact that not everyone supports your reign.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> You come into my house, you do whatever the hell it is you're doing to my daughters, and you ask me to respect you? Why on earth would I do that?<eos> The previous king did.<eos> Moorefield, you're absolutely right.<eos> I know that many of you here today loved and supported my brother, just as I did.<eos> But in this day and age, it's important that we respect and encourage all ideologies.<eos> To some, this monument is divisive.<eos> It represents an institution they don't believe in.
You listen to me, little man!<eos> The monument is going to happen!<eos> No, it isn't!<eos> And for your information, the King sort of runs things around here!<eos> Oh, do you really believe that?<eos> Because you don't.<eos> I do.<eos> I put you on the throne. And I humiliated myself with the paternity scandal.<eos> And now you're trying to rehabilitate your image with this monument.<eos> It's no wonder you had them make it out of glass, it's all so transparent!
She's in limerence.<eos> It is so clean in here.<eos> She's in limerence.<eos> She's in what?<eos> Limerence.<eos> What's limerence? Puppy love, early days.<eos> It makes you clean your cabinets?<eos> She got a bidet.<eos> Oh, my God, I love those things.<eos> It's so clean and neat and organized.
I didn't want to be like one of those hoarders on television.<eos> See? Jesus, Mom.<eos> Everything is gone.<eos> You didn't want to keep anything, Mom?<eos> Nothing? None of the artwork I made for you as a kid?<eos> What about the painting of you holding that baby?<eos> That painting did not give me joy.<eos> It was very unattractive. I looked so angry.<eos> Whose baby was that anyway?<eos> It was a symbolic baby, Mom.

[A.D.I.S.N.] Access granted.<eos> Ooh! Are you going to report back to the Quail at HQ?<eos> I just sounded so professional.<eos> No, I'm gonna ask A.D.I.S.N. to find us the nearest NOV-Eight safe house.<eos> I live right near here.<eos> It's perfectly safe, and it's a house.<eos> [McKeyla] You're telling the truth, right?<eos> This isn't just about you wanting to have a prince in your house?<eos> It's very close.<eos> Swearsies. It's close and it's the perfect place to take a selfie with the Prince.
I don't know.<eos> And now I'm just wasting what little time you have left here.<eos> If only I could control-alt-delete myself.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I'm Adrienne Attoms!<eos> Growing up in Spain, I traveled to London all the time.<eos> I love everything British, except the food.<eos> Terribly bland.<eos> -Rubbish.<eos> -Exactly. It does taste like garbage.
I think I'm gonna be sick.<eos> We have to stop them.<eos> Looks like we might be too late.<eos> [reporter] Now, just moments away from watching Prince Xander take off into the skies.<eos> Cam, call your dad!<eos> Voicemail.<eos> He's gotta be in the control room already.<eos> There's no way I can reach him now.<eos> The hacking device.<eos> If we can find a way into Space Inc., we can stop it from getting on that spacecraft.
I probably should have mentioned before that I don't eat meat.<eos> I see.<eos> You know, there are some who just don't have the luxury to not eat meat.<eos> Only the strong survive! Right, boys?<eos> - So, are you guys Russian or something?<eos> - Russian? That is a good one!<eos> No, Raymond and Bunny, they're just, very traditional, set in their ways, as are we!<eos> But it is no matter. Everything's fine.<eos> You don't have to eat the meat. - No.<eos> - It's actually really good.
Chief, please, not in front of the newbie.<eos> Alright, alright.<eos> Just kidding man.<eos> Don't get offended so easily.<eos> But I have plenty friends who fucked chicken.<eos> You and your friends, man!<eos> Look, it's not about fucking the chicken.<eos> No, it's about catching it.<eos> Chief, why don't you tell us about your first time?<eos> - Was it with a goat or a cow?

- We ran over the guy. - We hit him. There were noises.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Then where is he?<eos> - How the hell should I know?<eos> He sure as hell didn't fly away!<eos> I don't fucking know!<eos> We hit that man, and he's gone now!<eos> - Seyfi, your face is bleeding.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Your face. It's bleeding.
I'm begging you, please.<eos> Yavuz.<eos> Open the eyes of your heart, Yavuz.<eos> Don't let me down, Yavuz.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> Come on, Yavuz.<eos> Show us that you are the right passenger.<eos> I'm begging you, don't do it. Don't do it.<eos> Open your heart to us, Yavuz.<eos> Don't stop, and it will open.
Open your mind.<eos> Don't stop, and it will open, Yavuz.<eos> Open your heart to us, son.<eos> Come on, dear.<eos> Come on, Yavuz.<eos> Come on, Yavuz. Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> Yavuz, you're not opening your heart.<eos> You're not.<eos> It should be wide open. Otherwise, it's no good.
Hey, what'd I miss?<eos> Now it's personal.<eos> How did a werewolf get a pilot's license?<eos> It's got the intelligence of a man.<eos> Yeah, but you'd think when it applied for a license... somebody would have said something.<eos> Maybe it dressed up like a man when it went into the office.<eos> Shut your curd-holes!<eos> To catch the monster, we've got to think like the monster.<eos> You mean think like a man?<eos> You said it's got the intelligence of a man.
Don't destroy your family.<eos> Don't you dare put this shit on me.<eos> Harvey?<eos> Where did you just go? I'm sorry.<eos> I was just thinking about the time I had to decide whether or not I should tell my father that my mother was cheating on him.<eos> And maybe we should talk about that.<eos> I didn't come here to talk about that.<eos> I came here to figure out whether or not I should resign.<eos> And then you started thinking about your mother.<eos> And if your brain went to the one, then it's connecting it to the other, and the best thing we can do right now is to try and figure out why.
And I mean funny "messed up," not funny "ha-ha-ha."<eos> CYBORG [OVER COMM]:<eos> There was never anything wrong with the reactor.<eos> L'm beginning to think you're right.<eos> Aw, the nuketron reactor is finished.<eos> Why did you destroy our power plant?<eos> - What are you, blind?<eos> -Ahem.<eos> What my colleague means to say is that you may not have noticed your new power plant was experiencing a meltdown?<eos> You know, now it does look a little less melty.
I'd be totally done by now.<eos> [SHORTING]<eos> Right?<eos> L just came to give you a little farewell gifl.<eos> I hope you kept the gifl receipt, Sinestro.<eos> Keep firing.<eos> He'll have to keep up that shield and won't be able to attack.<eos> Think so'?<eos> Meet my new best friend.<eos> It's called a Father Box.
[GRUNTS]<eos> Gotta keep moving.<eos> This evidence is more important than me getting payback.<eos> [GRUNTS]<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hey, that was Wonder Woman's Invisible Jet.<eos> Oh, when she finds out what you did, you are gonna be in so much trouble.<eos> She'll never find out nor will the rest of the Justice League because I flushed them all to the opposite side of the universe.<eos> [CYBORG GASPS, THEN SINESTRO LAUGHING]<eos> I say flushed because I created this wormhole, you see and it resembled a--
It's been hard on all of us not catching Budd after all this time, and never finding Luke.<eos> Been eating at Tony-- I know that.<eos> Budd's been quiet.<eos> Maybe too quiet.<eos> Is it something we said? Taking a walk.<eos> I'll be back later.<eos> Well... I think McGee could've given me a little bit better heads up.<eos> "Rule 45"-- what's that?<eos> Clean up your own mess.<eos> It's not all yours, Tony.
You really think he can help?<eos> I do.<eos> Where do we go from here?<eos> The owner's gone, the lawyer's gone, and Red and Liz are gone.<eos> Why would he go to all this trouble, risk everything, just to free Marvin Gerard?<eos> Put the word out.<eos> They're in the wind, and we're back to square one.<eos> You have no idea what I've offered Chui to divulge the secret of this recipe.<eos> He won't say.<eos> I suspect it has something to do with how he beats his eggs.
What is this "we"?<eos> I have to go and register Joe for the winter camp.<eos> Mommy's going to buy shoes.<eos> I did not raise a rat!<eos> Nobody gets out of this.<eos> World's worst sport, world's worst players of it.<eos> 22 girls in a cluster zig-zagging across a field like a busted Roomba.<eos> Except the only thing it sucks up is two hours of my life.<eos> Behold, the unsellable house.<eos> Two years on the market, it's crushed the soul of every real-estate agent in town.
That's romantic.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Yeah.<eos> Uh, you know, just decided to ditch the families this year.<eos> But Ojai is only a few hours away, so, if, uh, if Supergirl needs anything, just give me a call.<eos> Oh, honestly, I'm more worried about my family this weekend.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Alex is worried my foster mom's going to chew her out because I came out as Supergirl.<eos> - That makes zero sense.<eos> - Right?<eos> And yet, it is weekend for loved ones.
You have a piano.<eos> - No one touches it.<eos> - No problem.<eos> I've given it up.<eos> All right, follow me.<eos> Have you been here long?<eos> Since God knows when.<eos> Must be quite a while then.<eos> I never enter this room.<eos> Maybe it's full of cockroaches.
I've missed you so much.<eos> You too, Mum.<eos> Come in.<eos> Constance, wait a second!<eos> You've taken my room?<eos> We're just redecorating.<eos> We'll put your things back like before.<eos> We'll use it as an office when you're away...<eos> I get it.<eos> It's still your room, sweetheart.
Hard to say.<eos> In Precrime, the time horizon would vary.<eos> Anywhere from 36 to 48 hours, depending on the level of premeditation.<eos> But that's with all three Precogs in the milk bath.<eos> We saw more clearly as a hive mind.<eos> So?<eos> Three days was the most from vision to murder.<eos> But we do know that this happens after dark, so it could be as soon as tonight.<eos> Her wrist.<eos> Hold it there.
Jared was a good soldier.<eos> And he didn't... he didn't deserve to die like that.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> I found a fragment of metal.<eos> I want you to give to Dr. Hodgins for analysis.<eos> It was lodged within a comminuted fracture on the left zygomatic.
Such lack of control is indicative of lack of experience.<eos> Agent Miller is highly trained.<eos> I'm seeing multiple depression fractures.<eos> I've counted 16 of them.<eos> The depressions are cylindrical.<eos> Dr. Hodgins swabbed the injuries and found traces of steel.<eos> I'm thinking the murder weapon could be a-a pipe.<eos> It wasn't a pipe.<eos> There's a pattern to these fractures.<eos> It's very slight, but it's as if these depressions are evenly spaced in groups of four.

Oh, God, you really are incredible.<eos> You already said that.<eos> Well, you know, I lost a lot of blood here, Bones-- at least half.<eos> Not half.<eos> Two-fifths at most.<eos> That's a lot.<eos> Can I get the water?<eos> Sure.<eos> - That's a lot of blood.<eos> Okay, but it wasn't half. It was pouring out of me.
It wasn't, but it is now.<eos> Kylie's mom needs help? I'll help Kylie's mom.<eos> You know what, we're-we're good.<eos> I'll-I'll text your teacher and see who else is chaperoning.<eos> Hey, Mom, uh, can I borrow the car?<eos> Gabe and I are gonna go see a movie.<eos> Which movie?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> I'm 17. I can see what I want.<eos> It's Minions.
My Capri pants?<eos> I got these in Germany!<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom?<eos> I need your Wi-Fi password. Honey, I have to finish this book before the book club gets here.<eos> No, I-I have two minutes to send this e-mail.<eos> I just need the Wi-Fi code.<eos> John, what the password to the computer?<eos> Yeah, the "wiffy"?<eos> Dad, it's not seven.

I don't think we want to do that, sir.<eos> These are fragments from the bomb.<eos> I found the exact same technology inside the drone Kara brought in yesterday.<eos> So whoever was spying on me was also behind the bombing?<eos> Yes.<eos> And I think I may have a lead.<eos> - Maxwell Lord?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Both the bomb and the drone used an advanced fiber optics relay system.<eos> It's not even on the market yet.

Yes, Paulina?<eos> PAULINA:<eos> Could you come down to Level Three?<eos> Security discovered it during a routine sweep of the floor.<eos> (DEVICE BEEPING)<eos> Clear the building.<eos> Don't move that, it could go off!<eos> That would never happen with the fulcrum weight of a helium core.<eos> We need to evacuate.<eos> I've got a lab full of pretty brilliant work, here. I'd like to keep it from going up in smoke.
Are you hurt?<eos> - No.<eos> She must have triggered his emergency self-preservation function.<eos> I can't see it.<eos> He's in stealth mode, making him 100% undetectable.<eos> This is your fault.<eos> You asked me to fight it.<eos> And now your recklessness has unleashed an uncontrollable killing machine on National City.<eos> A billion dollar investment, 11 years of RD, and what do we have?<eos> I want this thing found and destroyed before it turns National City into a war zone.
(SHOUTING)<eos> Well, nothing's broken.<eos> She's lucky.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - You let that thing get away.<eos> I thought you were on our side.<eos> I tried.<eos> It fought harder this time, faster.

What's the first picture you ever took?<eos> My dad.<eos> He gave me a camera right before he left for the Gulf War.<eos> It was better than what my family could afford, but, uh, still wasn't a very good one.<eos> And then he didn't come home.<eos> (INHALES DEEPLY)<eos> And I just... (CHUCKLING) I never put that camera down.<eos> You look like him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When you take a picture of someone, it's permanent.
Look at this Inspector, these are the same coins.<eos> Those coins...<eos> And I could see how the person dragged the body.<eos> As I said before, I was walking Renzo, just like every morning.<eos> Suddenly, I saw a mysterious woman who was dragging a bulk.<eos> She was wearing a red coat and a black skirt.<eos> The situation was very strange to me, so I hid behind a tree to see what she was doing.<eos> Renzo got nervous and started barking.<eos> At that moment, the woman realized that I was spying on her. So she left the bulk and ran.<eos> I couldn't see her face because it was veiled and she wearing a black capeline.
Mommy wants to play with you.<eos> Mommy wants to play with you.<eos> Mommy wants to play with you.<eos> Mommy wants to play with you.<eos> Mommy wants to pl...<eos> Mommy wants to play with you.<eos> The situation is getting out of hand, Detective.<eos> Three unsolved murders in one week.<eos> What do we know about the victim?<eos> It is Mr. Giovanni Bianco, the renowned pianist.
Where's my money?<eos> - In a safe, dry place.<eos> - Go get it.<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> Because I like you, Charlie, and I don't want to see you die.<eos> Die?<eos> If you take your money, you'll go to a woman's house in Glenville, 73 miles from here.<eos> Lauren-something... I didn't get a last name.<eos> You're not going to be wearing what you have on now.<eos> Lauren kept your Naval Academy sweatshirt because it still smelled like you.
She'd done it before.<eos> She was in another group marriage?<eos> Arrangements like ours happen more often than people think.<eos> For some people, it just works.<eos> It worked for Abby.<eos> Mostly.<eos> Her last marriage was a bad one?<eos> It ended badly.<eos> She had a falling-out with one of her fellow wives.<eos> She hinted it got violent once.
Support groups can be very helpful for cancer patients.<eos> They're going through so many things that only their peers can understand.<eos> And Abby Campbell had been attending your group for three months?<eos> Ever since her diagnosis.<eos> We have reason to believe that she was collecting blood during these meetings.<eos> May we assume it was from her fellow group members?<eos> Ms. Russof, this is a murder investigation.<eos> A few weeks ago, Abby made a pitch to the group.<eos> She said she had a friend who was doing advanced cancer research.<eos> It was supposed to be promising.

Let's hope the lug nut expands.<eos> What if that burning food attracts animals?<eos> We have plenty of food for the animals. We do?<eos> WOLOWITZ: Yep.<eos> A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.<eos> That's not very nice.<eos> It's a bachelor party. Lighten up.<eos> (electric crackling)<eos> What is that awful smell?<eos> It's burning salsa.
Hey, I haven't been able to reach you.<eos> Oh. Someone ran over my phone.<eos> I found a shop in Tacoma that carries our elusive costume.<eos> Got a name for the girl who rented it the night of the frat party.<eos> Apparently, she rented it for her boyfriend.<eos> They're on their way in.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Captain Wozzles is awesome.<eos> Um, why do you want to talk about the costume?<eos> I swear, it wasn't damaged when we returned it.

- He loved me.<eos> You just don't know the difference.<eos> Make it out for half a million.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Chip off the old block.<eos> Katy Perry.<eos> Kate Upton.<eos> Kate Middleton.<eos> I mean, all three doable and datable. This game is impossible.<eos> By the time I got the Captain Wozzles costume from the shop, it had already been laundered.
Target 2 on the ground.<eos> Don't!<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> Hello, can I help you?<eos> The painting in your window. Take it down.<eos> - You want to look at it?<eos> - Take it down, I said!<eos> - Do you know this Narcisse?<eos> - No, I'm new, here.<eos> Where does it come from?
- Can I have my phone back?<eos> - I'll think about it.<eos> - Yes, Dimoun?<eos> - I tested your stuff.<eos> What stuff?<eos> The fragments from Icarus beach.<eos> There's a surgical mirror piece, with no trace of salt.<eos> It doesn't come from the sea.<eos> Those shadowless surgical lights...<eos> It must come from a surgeon's headlamp.
Graziano took a lot more risks then me.<eos> NARRATOR: Valentino Rossi's father Graziano was a grand prix rider in the Seventies and Eighties who retired through injury.<eos> ROSSI: Growing up, I learned from him.<eos> The son learned from the father's mistakes.<eos> Bad memories, a lot of crashes, a lot of injuries.<eos> So, yes, it's scary because he's my father.<eos> NARRATOR: It will happen.<eos> Learning means crashing.<eos> When you're out to extract the maximum from a 240-horsepower motorcycle, there's no other way.<eos> Go over the limit and then you know where it is.
COMMENTATOR: Marquez dives for the inside line.<eos> LORENZO: For a moment I thought I finish second.<eos> MARQUEZ: Then on that last corner when I changed direction, I feel no power, I go a little bit wide.<eos> LORENZO: I have to try.<eos> This is my chance.<eos> I have to win this race.<eos> COMMENTATOR: It's gonna be a drag to the line between the Yamaha and the Honda.<eos> Jorge Lorenzo wins an incredible battle here at Silverstone!<eos> Lorenzo won the next race in San Marino, cutting Marquez's lead to 34 points with five races to go.<eos> It was Rossi's home race.
OK.<eos> We'll continue on foot.<eos> You go straight through the woods. I'll climb to the top.<eos> - 90 minutes left.<eos> Here.<eos> Yes?<eos> The comet will be in the south.<eos> The observation window...<eos> Hello?<eos> It keeps breaking up.
Yes, it's cute.<eos> It's in a great spot, but I'd open it up a bit, knock down a few walls in the front, give it some space.<eos> You'd need more space?<eos> We might.<eos> Haven't you thought about it?<eos> A family?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I pushed.<eos> You once said you knew I had a secret.<eos> You know what it is?
Well, whatever it is, silver slows it down.<eos> I, uh, I'm sending you a picture right now... Of its fangs.<eos> I-I've never seen anything like it.<eos> See if there's a match in the lore, would ya? I'm on it.<eos> Dean, I got jumped.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - I think... For now.<eos> Pretty sure we're dealing with a pack here.<eos> Uh, two of these things were attacking Mrs. Markham when I arrived.<eos> I-I filled them with silver, but it only slowed them down.
♪ Sex glue... ♪ You are trouble.<eos> Sorry this night turned out to be so shitty.<eos> It's getting better.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Why don't you go to college?<eos> You're, like, the smartest guy I ever met.<eos> I did. I dropped out.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know. I... I guess I just reject the whole group-think mentality of higher education.<eos> It's a bunch of bullshit.
Reddington.<eos> Let's go now.<eos> Move, move!<eos> Welcome aboard, Elizabeth.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I gave you the journal.<eos> I kept my end of the deal.<eos> Your deal was with him.<eos> Women.<eos> ♪ it's the ending of the show ♪ It was empty when I found it...
Really?<eos> You register yet for your fall classes?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Don't you think you'd better get on it?<eos> There's still time.<eos> Some of those courses, they fill up fast.<eos> "Enrollment in the Taxation Seminar is strictly limited to 20 students."<eos> What are you doing with my course catalog?<eos> I'm trying to get you to read it, David.<eos> It's been sitting on the kitchen counter gathering dust all summer.
Oh. Good one, Mr. G.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you today?<eos> Oh, nothing. I'm barely even winded.<eos> Come here.<eos> You must not want this bonus very much.<eos> Speaking of the bonus, since you bring it up, did we ever discuss whether it's payable as cash or check?<eos> Are you on, pills?<eos> You on coke?<eos> Oh, gosh, no. No.<eos> Well, whatever your problem is, fix it.
And your victim was killed for that briefcase, so you find your killer, I find my missing item.<eos> Everyone goes home happy, hmm?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, what was our victim hired to transport?<eos> A Van Gogh, lost since World War II, purchased at auction 3 weeks ago for $65 million.<eos> S08E05 The Nose<eos> Long-lost Van Gogh sold for a fortune.<eos> How come this wasn't on the Internet?<eos> The painting has a complicated history.<eos> It was looted several times during the war, which made an aboveboard sale impossible, so it was auctioned secretly in Zurich, with potential buyers bidding remotely.
I didn't hire Freddy to steal it.<eos> I hired him to retrieve it.<eos> Justin stole it from us.<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> You hired Justin to transport the painting.<eos> No.<eos> I hired someone else.<eos> Transporters work on commission, payable upon delivery, and the commission for that painting was six figures.<eos> Justin must have gotten greedy and jumped the job.<eos> We didn't realize until the real transporter arrived to pick up the painting, and it was gone.
The Van Gogh, sir.<eos> Three weeks ago, you bid on it at an auction, and you lost.<eos> This morning, it was stolen, and a man was found shot to death.<eos> Mr. Carter just got back from Singapore this afternoon.<eos> No, we don't think you killed him.<eos> But you are in contact with the man who did.<eos> Liam Hollister, the transporter.<eos> According to the Falcon Unit, you've engaged his services numerous times.<eos> Yeah. He called, looking to unload the painting.<eos> I only bid on it 'cause Lorenzo thought it would look great hanging in my G5.
It's a forgery, you know?<eos> - What?<eos> - How do you know?<eos> You can smell it.<eos> Oil paint takes many years to become fully dry.<eos> That smells way too fresh to be from the 19th century.<eos> That's definitely not the painting that was in the killer's briefcase.<eos> Maybe Liam was telling the truth?<eos> If he was, it would explain why Justin gave up the painting so easily.<eos> He knew it was a fake.
Oh! Oh, coming from her, that's high praise.<eos> - Hey, Beckett, I got something.<eos> - We've got something.<eos> Yeah, that's what I said.<eos> - That's not what you said.<eos> - Okay, it's what I meant.<eos> Okay, you both get gold stars for the day if just one of you can tell me what's going on.<eos> We did some digging into this painting's tortured history.<eos> Stolen during World War II.<eos> It ended up in a private collection before coming up for auction.
Give me one good reason why I should.<eos> I'll give you two. - Oh!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Put... put the gun back... back to me.<eos> Point it at me.<eos> Look, that painting belongs to my family.<eos> My father spent his life trying to find it.<eos> He died a broken man.<eos> There's no way I'm going to let it sit in some billionaire's man cave.
He's got a rock-solid alibi.<eos> Well, that makes sense.<eos> If he was willing to kill Justin, he'd already have the Van Gogh and he wouldn't have asked me to steal the fake one.<eos> Hold on.<eos> The Van Gogh you recovered is the forgery?<eos> How do you know about the forgery?<eos> Lorenzo, you are in a world of trouble.<eos> Your best bet is to tell us everything you know now.<eos> I have spent my entire adult life searching for that painting.<eos> When I heard it was coming up for auction, I tried to get my boss to buy it.
I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.<eos> Well, actually, he-he already did.<eos> Okay.<eos> But don't get too attached to him.<eos> In two years, 364 days, he's a dead man.<eos> I said no.<eos> Interesting.<eos> I asked two women out today, and they both said no.<eos> I didn't know you were interested in dating.<eos> I've been told it's a good way to move on.
According to the FAA, he's landed 30 times in the past three years.<eos> Each time coincided with the date of an abduction.<eos> He was scheduled to land today but scrubbed it less than an hour after we prevented Anna Neehoff from being taken.<eos> He was coming for her-- like the others.<eos> This plane is an ark.<eos> Or a jail.<eos> It can't be easy keeping 36 people against their will.<eos> It is if they're frozen.<eos> Um, no.<eos> It's an A380.
I came here for the Russian.<eos> He doesn't want to fight.<eos> What should we do about that, gentlemen?<eos> Don't make me do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The plane's not going to Halifax?<eos> Apparently not.<eos> But we're going to Halifax.<eos> NSA intel indicated that's where the plane was heading. Uh... it's not.<eos> It's landing near Pittsburgh.
There's no S.D. card in here.<eos> It's wi-fi-enabled.<eos> So's this printer.<eos> Maybe the last job is still in the memory. Let's see.<eos> Yeah, that's Scott in bed with a woman, but you can't see her face.<eos> No, but look what you can see.<eos> I think that's her elbow.<eos> No, not that.<eos> The tattoo on the small of her back...<eos> It's a dragonfly.
Isn't she in the tabloids all the time?<eos> Which is how we recognized her and how we know that she's going through a messy divorce.<eos> You know Annika. Now meet Nancy Underwood and Claire Stevens...<eos> Both loaded and going through divorces.<eos> There's a picture of all three of them at a fundraiser last week.<eos> So they know each other?<eos> Oh, more than that.<eos> They hang out together. Matter of fact, according to Annika's Instagram, they're going to a spa later.<eos> And you know what this means, Beckett...<eos> It's a murderous first wives club.
Stop!<eos> Stop her! No!<eos> No, don't stop us!<eos> Found it. Mm.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well... time to get dressed. Spa day's over.<eos> Yeah, but before we go, can you please give me the number of your tattoo artist?<eos> You're right...<eos> The guy's a bloody genius.<eos> And when you I.D.'d the tattoo, did you pull the towel off, or did it just... fall off?
Can't a guy make an honest living creating undead and selling them cadaver brains?<eos> "Two's not that bad." Smiley face.<eos> I appreciate the pep talk, big fella.<eos> I really do.<eos> But I don't think there's an emoji that rightfully expresses my feelings about losing 50K a month. You know?<eos> - I found Gabriel.<eos> - The archangel?<eos> Gabriel cut the Utopium the night of the boat party.<eos> And you're never gonna guess where he is now.<eos> I've walked through the valley of death, and it looks a lot like a crack den on Third Avenue.
Then shut your mouth!<eos> Why?<eos> We had products finished on time.<eos> So why are we making new ones?<eos> What's wrong with this one?<eos> Hey, Ms. Tokita...<eos> The material is hygroscopic cupro, regenerated fiber made with natural materials.<eos> Thin and delicate, ideal for underwear.<eos> Cups are silk of very high quality.<eos> Wonder how many hands went through to make it.

-The police stated that--<eos> -Look! He stepped all over me.<eos> Choi's a Hulk.<eos> He crushed me once.<eos> I got a bloody bruise.<eos> He was a weakling, but he's so big now.<eos> They regularly have eel at company dinners.<eos> Shouldn't we do that too?<eos> We don't even get barbecued pork.<eos> It's nothing but noodle cups for us.
We need to call the police!<eos> No!<eos> No police.<eos> Please!<eos> Is this the police?<eos> I need to make a report.<eos> It's the serial killer.<eos> Forget my name. It's 143 Gusu, Mapo.<eos> Yes, he lives in the basement.<eos> It's filled with evidence.
We'll protect you from the police.<eos> Don't worry about anything. Focus on the follow-up.<eos> The police?<eos> They came up empty-handed.<eos> The case could drag on even longer.<eos> Wait.<eos> I left my phone in the car.<eos> Can you lend me yours for a second?<eos> -Holy cow!<eos> -Here it is.
-Was the indoor fishing raid a failure?<eos> Wasn't this avoidable had you listened to Heo?<eos> Shouldn't you apologize to Heo and the victim?<eos> Apologize! Apologize!<eos> I had a black bag over my head, but someone came in.<eos> And I heard sounds of struggle.<eos> I think he was trying to help me.<eos> But while they were fighting, I was choking, and I passed out for a short time.<eos> When I came to, the killer was beside me holding a knife.<eos> It was no ordinary knife. It was big and weird.

He would have been chasing a ghost.<eos> I was in the clear before...<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna blame Dash?<eos> Actually, I was gonna blame you.<eos> This is your fault and you know it.<eos> So you stole the money.<eos> Fine. - Let's just give it back.<eos> - Can't do that.<eos> It's all red diamonds in Hong Kong by now.
But you cleaned it up.<eos> Your way.<eos> But all that success went to your head.<eos> Got a little cocky.<eos> A little too greedy.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> No honor among thieves.<eos> Oh, that's ripe, coming from you.<eos> See, the reason I'm not going to give you your money back,<eos> Mr. Van Zant, is because it wasn't yours to start with.
I'm kind of loving this.<eos> Mitch and McGee.<eos> The cool cobbler and the... and the...<eos> The what?<eos> And... and the other guy.<eos> Can we get to the evidence, please?<eos> That's a good call, buddy.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> So... the red is where I found fibers on Sergeant Gleason's body and clothes.<eos> The position and abundance tell me that it was from something he was carrying before he died.
Conspiracy to distribute.<eos> You and Nazarian should have plenty to talk about.<eos> I think he used to be a customer of yours.<eos> I'm also awaiting trial for attempted murder.<eos> But think I'll beat that.<eos> What about you?<eos> I'm an entrepreneur whose company under performed due to market conditions beyond my control.<eos> Feds called it postal fraud.<eos> So how do I know this game is honest?<eos> Just assume it isn't, and you'll do fine.
Well, no.<eos> Looks like an accident.<eos> We're just being thorough.<eos> Only items on his body were his VOQ room card, a fitness bracelet and cell phone.<eos> Last call was to you, 19:41 last night.<eos> And according to Suzy, the very nice desk clerk, Newton jogged every evening since he arrived here.<eos> - Duck?<eos> - I've always believed that jogging does more harm than good. The major here is an extreme example of my theory.<eos> The human body was never designed to take that kind of pounding.<eos> It's calamitous to the vertebrae, not to mention the trauma it does to the knees.
Bam! Thanks, Tony.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Um, on-line traffic school.<eos> What'd you get a ticket for?<eos> Speeding?<eos> Run a red light?<eos> No, no.<eos> I just... I needed to tell Sister Rosita that I was gonna be late for bowling, so I pulled over to the side of the road so I could safely text her, and I just kind of tapped this other car.<eos> Just like a love tap, you know.<eos> But it was a cop car.
Because Dillon now works in the armory at Quantico.<eos> Anybody else coming in today?<eos> It's still early, boss.<eos> Yeah, Abbs.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Be right down.<eos> McGee, when DiNozzo gets in, you two go to Quantico.<eos> You talk to Master Sergeant Dillon.<eos> This little baby is really cool.<eos> It's GPS-enabled, and it keeps track of your distance jogged and your pace and time.

NCIS headquarters work for you?<eos> I was in Richmond.<eos> Okay.<eos> What were you doing there?<eos> I act in a local theatre group.. We were rehearsing a play, okay?<eos> Really?<eos> What-What's the play?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Well... yeah.<eos> We're gonna find out what play it was anyway.
It's gotta be Roger Thrunk, doesn't it?<eos> We already know he's a murderer.<eos> Let's not forget Harry owed someone enough money that a goon was sent to collect.<eos> The man's a degenerate gambler.<eos> That was kind of his dominant personality trait, huh?<eos> This is gonna get ugly.<eos> Suzuki's widow gave you a brain?<eos> Yeah. In a piece of Tupperware.<eos> Like she was handing me cake.<eos> And you think it's human?

Maybe there was a life insurance policy.<eos> You ever think of that?<eos> The moron's on the damn rail!<eos> Listen, if I happen to be right, and the widow is flush, you have her to drop on by and see me, okay?<eos> What odds are you giving on the notorious bookie Harry owed money?<eos> Man, I don't even have a motorcycle license.<eos> Hypothetically.<eos> Literally.<eos> Thread the needle, baby!<eos> That soft grass is nothing, it's nothing.

Don't suppose you got a 20 on the Darkness.<eos> Uh, well, I thought I had something earlier.<eos> Half a town flipped their gourds and started attacking people, but it turns out they'd eaten rabid possum meat.<eos> Okay, they do realize that possum is a giant rat, right?<eos> It's a marsupial.
Lizzie definitely hacked them.<eos> You can see it in her eyes -- serial-killer eyes.<eos> I-I ditched her quick after that.<eos> And you didn't tell the police.<eos> "A" -- restraining order.<eos> "B" -- what am I supposed to say?<eos> I was hanging out talking murder with a 12-year-old girl in the middle of the night?<eos> Where does the symbol come in?<eos> She had it on her shoulder.<eos> I don't know if it was a scar or -- or a birthmark.
I mean...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I thought it was nothing, but he was acting really weird yesterday.<eos> Weird how?<eos> Well, after class, we went to this thrift shop.<eos> We needed to buy costumes for a party off-campus.<eos> And Mike found this super creepy bunny mask.<eos> I mean, it -- it grossed me out, which he just loved.
Uh, I-I thought we were friends.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> You sound 15.<eos> - Boo! - Alex!<eos> - I've been sitting out here 20 minutes.<eos> - Well, yell at Jo for not changing her oil in over a decade.<eos> Between you and this anatomy class, my morning is shot.<eos> I need to stop teaching this anatomy class.<eos> Your neighbors seem nice.<eos> Yeah, the block's a pit, but it's cheap.
I took her to angio, put in a stent.<eos> But she's likely to have deficits... possibly a stroke, paralysis...<eos> She's still out.<eos> - Speech and language issues, vision loss.<eos> - Pressure's good, but we won't know.<eos> Or she could just be in a coma.<eos> You people are extraordinary.<eos> I mean, I came in here today and did all kinds of things wrong, but in spite of that, you all still did amazing and perfect work.<eos> And you found a way to do something that was, in fact, impossible.<eos> So if there is a bad outcome, it's my bad outcome.
The focus of this task force is to find Reddington and Keen, so I understand if you feel that this is something we can't pursue.<eos> Forget that.<eos> We are doing it for you, for your brother.<eos> We're doing it, right?<eos> Agent Mojtabai.<eos> When?<eos> Okay, got it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> A video was just sent to several news outlets.<eos> It was turned over to the Bureau a few minutes ago.
He's been on our radar for at least three years.<eos> - So he's not Hasaan? - No.<eos> Neither are the other three.<eos> - How can you be so sure?<eos> - They're too young.<eos> Hasaan is in the wind.<eos> We need to get the hostages somewhere safe, start taking their statements.<eos> Right now, they're our best chance of finding Hasaan.<eos> Well, our facility's a few miles away...<eos> - It's a logical place.
Where have you... are you okay?<eos> - We need to meet. - What's going on?<eos> Wing Yee's, one hour.<eos> I have good news.<eos> It's Tom.<eos> He wants to meet.<eos> That's not a good idea.<eos> Aram.<eos> The burner wasn't Agent Keen's or Mr. Reddington's.<eos> It was Tom's.
My mother saw it.<eos> Her friends won't talk to her.<eos> Everybody's trying to figure out who the woman is, as if it's any of their business.<eos> Thank the lord, she's okay.<eos> At least her life isn't over, too.<eos> Nothing is over.<eos> It's different for us... the clergy.<eos> People put their trust in us...<eos> their faith.<eos> We break that trust, it stays broken.
The truth is right there for the world to see.<eos> It's Grey.<eos> She wants me all week.<eos> Hmm. She still wants to work with me?<eos> Or she still wants to ruin you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's definitely one of those.<eos> Come on.<eos> Our shame can choke us, kill us.<eos> It can rot us from the inside... if we decide to let it.

You've stumbled on a state-of-the-art virology shop.<eos> Matchett didn't steal verdiant's genome blueprint so he could release it publicly.<eos> He needed it to identify its weaknesses and design a virus tailor-made to destroy it.<eos> He wants to sabotage their gmo crop?<eos> 90% of all corn grown in America is genetically modified. Verdiant is the largest producer of it.<eos> In fact, this one strain is planted all over the world.<eos> If this virus gets out, it will spread fast.

You've stumbled on a state-of-the-art virology shop.<eos> Matchett didn't steal verdiant's genome blueprint so he could release it publicly.<eos> He needed it to identify its weaknesses and design a virus tailor-made to destroy it.<eos> He wants to sabotage their gmo crop?<eos> 90% of all corn grown in America is genetically modified. Verdiant is the largest producer of it.<eos> In fact, this one strain is planted all over the world.<eos> If this virus gets out, it will spread fast.<eos> How fast? It would cross state lines in weeks, maybe even days.<eos> Within months, it would migrate overseas.
When there was no more room in the floor safe.<eos> When did we get a floor safe?<eos> When we got the security camera.<eos> There's a security camera?<eos> Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.<eos> We've done things on that couch.<eos> You don't have to tell me.<eos> So, your father-in-law is in there right now?<eos> Yes. So back me up.<eos> The house is good the way it is. Oh, okay.
Your dad's on your side.<eos> He's not on my side.<eos> He's doing all the work for free.<eos> That is so generous of you.<eos> I'd like to switch sides.<eos> I don't even think you can take this wall down 'cause it's load-bearing.<eos> Well, it's easy to find out.<eos> Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.<eos> When is your visa up?<eos> Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth.
So now rise up, and fight for your leader!<eos> Fight together, and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter!<eos> Yeah, let's go!<eos> All right, follow me!<eos> This way, everyone!<eos> Another local business is closing its doors tonight after being taken down by Yelp reviewers.<eos> Whistlin' Willy's, a child favorite in town, was destroyed and its owner stripped and beheaded.<eos> The following video is graphic.<eos> We all loved Whistlin' Willy's.<eos> It didn't do well with Yelpers.
Or the killer is cunning and is trying to mislead the investigation.<eos> Perhaps we should bring this discussion into my office.<eos> Great idea.<eos> Good job, Bones.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Is that for me?<eos> Oh, yes. I sure as hell am not drinking any catnip tea.<eos> Wow, you remembered my drink.<eos> It's definitely an acquired taste, but I guess that sums me up in a nutshell, too.
Gee, thanks, Dad, but I can handle myself.<eos> All right, look, Aubrey, I know you know what to do.<eos> But I'm just saying, if you're serious about getting into politics one day, you just, you have to be careful about what you say, Aubrey.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll hang back.<eos> Good, all right.<eos> Bones, what is it?<eos> Hodgins found traces of a poison called Succinylcholine on the abrasion to the skull.<eos> I think I've heard of that stuff.<eos> It is often considered an ideal homicidal poison because its half-life is exceptionally short, meaning the body metabolizes it so rapidly, it would be untraceable in the blood.

Yeah, you're playing like Tiger Woods now.<eos> But by the end of the day, you'll be playing like Tiger Woods now.<eos> Hey! I wasn't even focusing my eyes.<eos> Top of the leader board, Timmy.<eos> Looks like I got my work cut out for me.<eos> Hey, you remember when you beat Dad at Pictionary and he burst a blood vessel in his eye, right?<eos> Not my fault Heather and I cheat. Yeah, well, he hates losing and especially to you.<eos> Loud and clear, buddy.<eos> There's no way in the world I can beat that guy at golf. Now, cornhole, on the other hand, that's my game.<eos> Though don't offer to play it at a truck stop.
Please don't kill me.<eos> - I'm not gonna kill you.<eos> - Is that what you told Victor before you buried a knife in his neck?<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> Then why were your fingerprints all over the murder weapon?<eos> I gave Victor that knife as a thank-you.<eos> A thank-you gi... flowers are a nice thank-you gift.<eos> A giant Rambo knife... that's psychotic.<eos> Eh, different strokes.<eos> But it's the truth.
Ah, you've come bearing jokes.<eos> Wonderful. So, we get an I.D. yet?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> She's a Jane Doe. 20s, contact gunshot wound.<eos> Looks like she was killed execution style, then dumped in the water.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Sounds like a mob hit.<eos> From who?<eos> Al Capone? That dress is straight out of the '20s.<eos> Uh, it's a costume, detective.
I mean, if she was an actual mule, - we'd be pulling out 20 of those.<eos> - At least. I'll put a rush on this at the lab.<eos> Meanwhile, we need to figure out which iconic cruise ship our Jane Doe was on, because that's our crime scene.<eos> I just got off the phone with Iconic Cruise Lines.<eos> Our victim is Lara Madden.<eos> She was a dancer in their show called "Speakeasy."<eos> Apparently she performed in it last night.<eos> Okay, well, that explains the flapper dress.<eos> And the boat she worked on is an old "Titanic"-era-themed oceanliner named the RMS Bently.<eos> It put into port at Manhattan cruise terminal at dawn.
Michigan I.D.?<eos> You contact her next-of-kin? Yeah, her mother is flying in later today.<eos> She said that Lara quit her job at an environmental nonprofit in order to work on the cruise line, all to help her family get out of debt.<eos> Perlmutter just called.<eos> Turns out that baggie from Lara's stomach...<eos> - Pure uncut heroin.<eos> - Uncut?<eos> No wonder she only swallowed one baggie. That 8-ball has a street value of $30k.<eos> Uncut heroin comes directly from the cartel, so how does a dancer from Michigan get her hands on that?<eos> It could have came from anybody on the ship.
Good thing Castle's nowhere near this one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ahoy!<eos> I'm the king of the world!<eos> Hello?<eos> Beckett?<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> How did you get on board?<eos> You know, we always talked about buying a boat.<eos> What do you think? I mean, I know it's a fixer-upper.
We need to dig into Acosta's life, see if he had any connections to that part of town.<eos> I'll give Beckett the heads-up.<eos> Hey.<eos> The trash company that contracts with the cruise line is called Friendly Islands Sanitation.<eos> They have satellites in Latin America, Caribbean, and North Africa.<eos> Oh, key points in the worldwide drug trade.<eos> So, somebody inside of the trash company must have cut a deal with Loksat to move drugs through the cruise line.<eos> The heroin shipment Lara videotaped was offloaded with the trash the minute the ship docked in New York... it could be anywhere by now.<eos> Okay, we got to follow the garbage, see where it went. On it.<eos> It's Castle.
Alex can hear us.<eos> Alex doesn't care about this.<eos> Do you care, Alex?<eos> Do I care about any of this conversation?<eos> No.<eos> Did he visit ladytown?<eos> Because I find if they don't go down to ladytown the first time, there should be no next time.<eos> - She's right about that.<eos> - No more talking!<eos> If either of you says another word, I will jump out of this car while it is moving.
Wait, aren't you supposed to be throwing a party right now?<eos> Crap.<eos> Deluca.<eos> Hey, look, I'm... I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I didn't mean to cross boundaries or not do my job, and I clearly pissed you off and Dr. Grey.<eos> So I'm sorry, and if it's about last night, I'm...<eos> Um, okay.<eos> Actually, I was... I was coming to apologize to you. Uh...<eos> That yelling was not about today.<eos> It was about last night.
Oh, come on, come on.<eos> Let's not get crazy here.<eos> All right, you took that very serious.<eos> Let's cue up "Big Pimpin'."<eos> - I'm gonna show you people how this is done.<eos> - No, no. Vega, buy you a beer?<eos> From my own fridge?<eos> Ooh, baller!<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> It's free.
Okay, give him some room.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> Okay.<eos> - People in suits, a crowd...<eos> - "Tav 8"?<eos> - What is that supposed to mean?<eos> - I'm not sure. It was white letters against a blue background.<eos> Maybe a uniform?<eos> Net searches for "Tav 8" bring up results about an antique military aircraft.<eos> It's been retired for decades. Great.
No.<eos> You're not.<eos> What, what?<eos> What is he talking about?<eos> Your eyes.<eos> Get her to a hospital now.<eos> Get me a secure exit.<eos> Go!<eos> The doctors are still trying to sequence the contaminant.<eos> Whatever it is, they're saying somehow it modified her DNA in real time.
I ran the plates to the suv.<eos> And it belongs to someone in the seattle pd.<eos> It's an official police vehicle.<eos> The badge bunny strikes again.<eos> - Who's our mystery cop?<eos> - No clue. The seattle pd own a thousand suvs,<eos> And there's no online record as to which cop drives which vehicle.<eos> Then it's another dead end.<eos> For the time being. But then I asked myself...<eos> What if this car was parked outside major's all night, And I wanted to find out who the nasty ho was who owned it.
Not writing.<eos> Bingo!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Chief walt price speaking.<eos> It's detective cavanaugh here.<eos> I'm afraid I've got some bad news.<eos> That evidence I told you about? The scrapbook?<eos> It's gone missing.

Turns out there were two different blood types at the crime scene.<eos> One of them belonged to regina.<eos> They're going to take blood from clive to see if it's a match.<eos> - It won't be.<eos> - No.<eos> But it won't necessarily exonerate him.<eos> We get eight more minutes.<eos> What do you want to talk about?<eos> Oh, what's the best american album of all time?<eos> I say, it's pet sounds, by the beach boys.
Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff... all the musical greats have been Russian.<eos> You? You have Debussy.<eos> - Heh-heh-heh...<eos> - Maestri! Actually, I must say I did some of my best work here in the New World.<eos> Thomas Pembridge, the man who fucked my first wife.<eos> And the second, but who's counting?<eos> - Ha-ha, burn! Rumor has it, Maestro Pembridge, you think you are a composer now.<eos> That's right. I am a composer.<eos> And actually, I've just finished a masterwork, thank you.<eos> People say it's fucking brilliant, yeah.
Thank you. Cheers.<eos> But fire is wildly difficult to contain.<eos> And just when you think you've extinguished the blaze...<eos> All right, we'll load it up.<eos> - Bailey's looking for you.<eos> You have to pull it together.<eos> - You're getting yourself in trouble.<eos> - I know.<eos> ...it reignites.<eos> It sucks in air, and it burns hotter and brighter than ever.
Boizu Rabu."<eos> But yaoi can branch out to other things, as well...<eos> Uh-oh. As we see here in "Lilly, Frog, Tweek, and Craig."<eos> I just don't get it.<eos> I mean, Tweek and Craig aren't gay, right?<eos> No. We would know.<eos> Well, but then why would Asian girls draw them like that?<eos> Yeah, what is this yaoi thing all about?<eos> I'm so co-confused.<eos> And if it can happen to Tweek and Craig, Could it happen to any of us?
And I am Token.<eos> Why do I do these things, you ask?<eos> Black rage.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> ISIS.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> This chicken tastes like shit.<eos> What'd you do to it?<eos> Okay...<eos> Okay, Dad, it's not organic chicken.
Did you know that the police in ShiTpaTown beat up homeless to clear them out?<eos> Do you know how long its been since I was able to just sit back and read the news?<eos> I got so used to getting news off the Internet, but I feel like I'm always trying to chase the news, somehow.<eos> It's like I'm in a black void trying to reach the news story.<eos> But then the next thing I know,<eos> I'm reading and ad for GEICO, so I click out of that and try to read the news story, but it's not a news story, it's a slide show, and I'm looking at the worst celebrity plastic-surgery jobs ever.<eos> So, of course, I want to see the next slide of plastic surgery gone wrong, so I hit the arrow.<eos> But then the arrow wasn't the arrow for the next slide, it was to take me for an ad for face cream.<eos> Aah! I wanted to get a news story, but I'm reading about face cream, and I try to click out of it, but the ad is following me.<eos> It's... It's following me all over the screen!
- Sweet.<eos> Sweet.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.<eos> A toast to our new working relationship?<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> I haven't actually seen big boss yet.<eos> Who's going to give me my hours, you know, like?<eos> I've already told Meisha I'm doing a dildo thing.<eos> It's not going to happen overnight, is it?
We thought maybe Mr. Milo could help with our investigation.<eos> - He's where? - Guatemala.<eos> He's, uh, showing a property.<eos> - the day after tomorrow? - Okay.<eos> I come back then.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Why would Milo know anything - about a stolen boat? - I don't know.<eos> Maybe he doesn't.<eos> Whoever took it must be crazy.<eos> It belongs to a man named Jesús.
Spitting fire.<eos> You working with me or against me, you freaking tape?<eos> She is super pissed.<eos> Quick, Tan. In and out, man.<eos> You got it.<eos> I'm out of tape!<eos> Oh, I'm not!<eos> Okay. Aah, the tape receded!<eos> - Okay, you got it?<eos> Got it.
Zombie killer.<eos> Qu'est-ce que c'est?<eos> You get what I need?<eos> Is this him?<eos> Indeed it is.<eos> Major, this is our head of RD.<eos> As far as you know, her name is Dr. Erving.<eos> Then, as far as I know, can her first name be Julius?<eos> I was told you needed a stronger sedative, but I'm afraid I need a few more details.<eos> In what way did it fail?
I'll meet you downstairs when you're done.<eos> We can watch Hoosiers.<eos> After all these years?<eos> You've always refused before.<eos> Well, back then, I was worried that seeing you cry over fictional sports would adversely affect my sexual desire for you.<eos> But that's not an issue anymore, friend.<eos> - Your tire's on my lawn, man.<eos> - Bill me.<eos> What're you doing here? I know my alibi checked out.<eos> - Yeah, it did.
Are they okay?<eos> Considering they can predict every murder within a hundred miles?<eos> Pretty normal kids.<eos> You want to meet them?<eos> Can they see us? Boo!<eos> You guys are such idiots.<eos> And then the neural interface collects the photons emitted by your neurons on each action potential.<eos> Will there be a test on this?<eos> No, I didn't want you to be scared.<eos> I thought understanding how it works might help.
Wait...<eos> Good work, Detective.<eos> You were right.<eos> He just told us.<eos> Why would he tell us?<eos> My new detail is a girl hopping off a swing?<eos> Damn it.<eos> Wally, what is going on?<eos> - Why can't I see more?<eos> - If it's really a minority report, that means there's another path the future might still take.
She couldn't defend herself.<eos> Anna had taken ecstasy an hour before her death. She didn't ﬁnd it by the river.<eos> If you mean that Anna didn't leave home just to take a walk on the quay, I was going to get to that.<eos> She sneaked out of the house because she wanted to go somewhere.<eos> A party or a nightclub, in order to meet someone.<eos> Her phone would have told us who if we had found it.<eos> That is right, Captain.<eos> The murderer took it so he wouldn't be identiﬁed.<eos> The operator could help us ﬁnd it.<eos> - If it's not in the Seine.
- Yes.<eos> Come on in, please.<eos> I didn't know your son before hopping on that plane.<eos> We just had adjacent seats.<eos> That was precisely the reason why I decided to contact you.<eos> I've been thinking that since you're about the same age and the trip was very long, you might have talked to each other.<eos> That's exactly what happened.<eos> But age had nothing to do with it.<eos> Your son didn't stop sketching on a notebook.<eos> I glanced at it and I saw it was a music notebook.
Here, take a look at this.<eos> Uh, the killer hid that inside the second book.<eos> Some kind of decoding device?<eos> So 47 was circled in the first book.<eos> So there must be a reason why they used two books.<eos> I mean, maybe it's referring to a... a page in the second book?<eos> So... page 47. Here we go.<eos> And the decoding device.<eos> Of course.<eos> It's a windowbox overlay.
Shooter picked the right perch.<eos> Building management says construction here got shut down a month ago.<eos> Union dispute with the law firm that owns it, Zyckner Williams.<eos> Floor's always vacant.<eos> No cameras.<eos> Nobody saw a thing.<eos> There's no latent prints on the gun.<eos> He must've worn gloves.<eos> I'm gonna go ahead and guess:<eos> it's not registered.

Is that why you comforted Mrs. Bova?<eos> Was I such a terrible father that you can't imagine me being kind to a widow?<eos> I'm only asking because it is treatable.<eos> It's not uncommon in men of your age.<eos> Isn't the more likely explanation that you've never seen me as I am?<eos> Owing to my deficient powers of observation.<eos> You live a life, Sherlock.<eos> If you're not a fool, it changes you.<eos> I don't think that either of us is a fool.<eos> I don't know Gagnier's location, but I do know where the program was uploaded and where it first began transmitting Bova's whereabouts.
- the building's owner.<eos> Bill, don't say a word.<eos> You do a very good job, Mr. Adler, but I must warn you your client is prone to sleeping with his lawyer's wives.<eos> Look, that video doesn't prove anything.<eos> I told you before:<eos> we're in the middle of a negotiation with Zyckner Williams.<eos> I gave one of their guys a gift to butter him up.<eos> A pricey new set of clubs.<eos> The deal we're hammering out-- it's big.<eos> Oh, it's quite massive, actually.
And as the fungus grows it takes over the ant's central nervous system, manipulating its behaviour.<eos> It then kills the ant and a stalk emerges from the skull, which explodes, spreading the fungus much further, creating armies of, for want of a better term, zombie ants.<eos> And this, in a sense, is what Brayban is seeking to do with our takeover of Nyromax. PHONE RINGS<eos> - Can you see what I'm getting at here?<eos> - Shit!<eos> Sorry, I'm going to take this.<eos> Did anyone else see that documentary?<eos> It was disgusting!<eos> I think the baby's coming.<eos> Yeah, I think it's coming.
- Yeah, I think...<eos> - OK, because<eos> I found it next to that.<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> Aw, shit, man. Your wee doggy's been hit.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey, Des,<eos> - what are you doing out here?<eos> Just... looking at the house.<eos> It's a lovely house when you look at it from this angle.
I just... Look, we're in this weird place right now.<eos> Weird place?<eos> Phil, I'm having a frigging baby.<eos> - I think you'd better leave now.<eos> - Gail, please, this is between me and Erica.<eos> There is nothing between you and Erica anymore.<eos> You made that perfectly clear when you confessed your love to Carol not five minutes ago.<eos> I'm the father of her child.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> - What? Oh, it'll have a father.
Does Wilson like salt or...<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm great.<eos> How are you?<eos> - You're not great. You're, uh, you're freaked out, and you're smiling a lot.<eos> Well, I'm having a dinner party.<eos> Yeah, like you're in a hostage video or something. Something's wrong.<eos> Uh, t-the house... it's filling with people, and I need to make drinks for those people, and...
- What?<eos> - Well, yeah.<eos> She's joining the program at Grey-Sloan Memorial.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Is she kidding?<eos> I rematched... to Grey-Sloan Memorial.<eos> Where were you working before... the, um, place that closed?<eos> It was, uh... a smaller suburban center out by the sound.
God, dating sucks.<eos> Sucks!<eos> See, my problem is getting a second date because the first one usually gets to sex, but the cool women, the women I'd like to see again, there's always some sort of automatic assumption that I've moved on.<eos> - Yeah, I see that.<eos> - Why?<eos> Why is that?<eos> Well, um...<eos> For starters, uh...<eos> Your hair...<eos> It's very confident.

I want to be in that room so that if something goes wrong...<eos> Don't worry, Riggs.<eos> If she dies, it'll be my fault.<eos> My wife's dying?<eos> - Uh, Mr. Brown. - Hello.<eos> We're taking Loretta up to surgery right now.<eos> We're going to do everything we can.<eos> Hang in there, Gary.<eos> How long ago did the light stop blinking?<eos> It stopped?
You don't have to.<eos> But just tell me...<eos> Do we hate him?<eos> We hate him.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> We hate him.<eos> So, um, how'd it go last night?<eos> Ugh. It didn't.<eos> I mean, dinner was great.<eos> It was fun, actually.
You two aren't seeing the B-I-G picture here.<eos> A lemur-ized foosa could return to her peoples and tell them how fun and awesome we are and to stop eating us.<eos> Think of it. Peace in our time zone.<eos> Wow. That actually is a good idea.<eos> Let the lemur-izing begin!<eos> - [foosa roars]<eos> I will now lemur-ize this foosa through the magic of science.<eos> Timo, thank you for volunteering.<eos> Actually, I-- I believe I tried running away.<eos> The unknown is always frightening, especially when it will most likely eat you.
Tell us about your new design.<eos> It's called an animal print.<eos> [Julien] Ha! That's no animal I've ever seen.<eos> Check this out!<eos> Well, it's clear that the diapers are on and the gloves are off, leaving the public to wonder who will win this fashion showdown.<eos> I know one thing's for sure.<eos> War has never looked so good.<eos> I think we may have let this fashion thing go too far.<eos> -I disagree!<eos> -But it's tearing the kingdom apart!
Oh, I never even liked pineapple before.<eos> [kissing] [door opens]<eos> What's going on?<eos> Duck and cover! Let my body be your shield.<eos> Oh, King Julien.<eos> I'm sorry. I was just setting up your new, uh, security system.<eos> You know, for... it.<eos> Ah, is it a good one? Oh, yeah, totally foolproof.<eos> I can't imagine anyone will be able to get past this.<eos> Ooh. You don't think it's too good, do you?

And they really weren't good at those either.<eos> When I found 'em, they were confused, trapped in a maze and practically starving.<eos> [male rat] Guys!<eos> So I helped them set up a working kingdom.<eos> Joey here became the first of the rat kings, King Joey.<eos> Welcome to my kingdom, AKA area.<eos> By listening to my advice, everything runs smoothly and everyone's happy.<eos> We sure are.<eos> We know where all the food is now.<eos> -Where is it again, Mr. Maurice?

But you can pal around with a hagfish?<eos> Hey, let's not pull at that thread.<eos> Okay. I'll fight SpongeBob, because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other.<eos> Um, I'll befriend the seal, because he's trainable, which is the problem<eos> I'm having with my current friends.<eos> Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.<eos> Isn't that gross?<eos> I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.<eos> I know.<eos> It makes its own gravy-- it'll slide right down.
Sheldon Cooper's descent into madness... day two.<eos> It's 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate.<eos> My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry.<eos> It's only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades.<eos> I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.<eos> Since when do you hum songs?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You were just humming.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.
Hey! I was humming.<eos> One point for Hufflepuff.<eos> What song is that?<eos> Well...<eos> Is that the SpongeBob song?<eos> ♪ Who lives in a pineapple ♪ Nope.<eos> Can we just get back to this?<eos> I feel like I know what song that is, but I can't put my finger on it.<eos> ♪ My country, 'tis of thee ♪ No.<eos> It's just an earworm.

Also, get a Waterpik too, if you really wanna blow your mouth's mind.<eos> Oh, excuse me, try to always cup it from the bottom.<eos> Like--'cause it can't support it with just the three horns.<eos> - Guess what I've been trying to say is, you can choose what you wanna see.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> Like, right now, what do you see?<eos> - I see Mike making our guests really uncomfortable.<eos> - I see an energetic young man who is full of potential who lives and breathes music every day.<eos> - Last night's performance was not bad.<eos> But it was alsonot not bad.

I don't want to carry a gun.<eos> They're really heavy and I travel light.<eos> You ever fired a gun?<eos> I don't know why I'm asking you that.<eos> Yes, I'm good at selling drugs and I'm glad you work here now.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I haven't seen you wear that shirt to work before.<eos> - This shirt?<eos> - Huh. Isn't it more of an evening shirt?<eos> I guess it's a little dangerous.

I haven't either.<eos> Had a lobotomy.<eos> You were the only normal one there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I remembered you saying that used to work in Spitalfields, so...<eos> I mean not that that's why I, you know...<eos> I was shopping. I bought a book.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> I've heard this is supposed to be great.<eos> - I should read this. - Yeah, just have it.
Yeah... I saw on the news.<eos> He sidelined as a superhero.<eos> You know, maybe there's a way for you to get brains that are a little... milder.<eos> You know, I was reading about some research that's been done on synthetic brains.<eos> Now, it's a long way off... I'm not eating synthetic brains.<eos> Well, they might work just like regular brains but without you having to...<eos> What? Serve a purpose?<eos> If I have to eat brains, I'm helping solve murders while I'm doing it.<eos> Okay, look, obviously this brain is affecting you.<eos> There it is.
Think about how excited everyone would be.<eos> I mean, that would be a pretty baller move.<eos> Right!<eos> And, look, once I find it, I come right back, put myself back in the stocks.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean...<eos> It's like you said, we're family.<eos> All right.<eos> Just a few more twisty-turnies here, and you and I will be in the shortwave radio business.<eos> You don't think it's gonna work, do you?
I'm back in town and wanted to see how Angela's work has progressed.<eos> But evidently, you need Angela for other things.<eos> Thank you, I do.<eos> Then I won't get in your way.<eos> Please let me know when you have time. Yeah, of course.<eos> Hey, so, I've got a reconstruction of the victim's face.<eos> All that predation made it difficult, but I was able to narrow it down to a pool of 379 women in the D.C. area.<eos> Okay, well, here's the right second distal phalanx I retrieved. Hopefully there's enough for a print. Yeah, let's run that through the fingerprint scanner.<eos> Wow, that's a total mess.<eos> Well, it might be enough to extrapolate a partial pattern.
Oh, okay, uh...<eos> Dad, someone here to see you.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> I-I-I'm Mr. Jay.<eos> Mr. Jay. This about Klarissa?<eos> We called her apartment, and her roommate told us the horrible news.<eos> Right, so how long has she been working for you?<eos> Oh, I met her years ago when she was doing street magic on the National Mall.<eos> So you gave Klarissa her start, then.<eos> Yes, I could see her talent immediately, and it paid off, because her shows were just groundbreaking.
It's a little experiment in weird science.<eos> Observe as I take this half dollar and place it in my hand.<eos> I'm about to cause a little-known anomaly to the laws of physics.<eos> If I hold this flame at the right distance from the coin, it will completely, somehow, dematerialize.<eos> Now that you're done, we can return to our work.<eos> Wouldn't you like to know how this magic trick was accomplished?<eos> You never placed the coin in your left hand.<eos> You simply retained it in your right hand behind the fingers.<eos> The lighter had nothing to do with the trick.<eos> It merely served as a misdirect so you could dispose of the coin in your pocket, which is where it is now, correct?
Behold a beaker of water.<eos> A teaspoon.<eos> If I put it in the water and concentrate hard enough it'll disappear.<eos> The spoon is made of gallium.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> You blew the trick.<eos> I most certainly did not!<eos> I molded you the perfect spoon!<eos> Gallium melts at 86 degrees.<eos> You obviously warmed the water just enough so it wouldn't steam.
So maybe he was cooking and... Reached around her neck and killed her.<eos> I think we might have found Klarissa's mystery lover.<eos> Take a look at this, Victor.<eos> What is it?<eos> Your fancy truffle oil was on Klarissa's neck.<eos> I left that oil at Anna's place.<eos> Klarissa probably used it to make an omelette.<eos> The only problem with that is that Klarissa had an allergy.<eos> She wouldn't go near the stuff.<eos> So how did it end up on her neck?
Look, I didn't say that it was a... it was a bad course.<eos> I just said the greens are like marble.<eos> The problem is you don't know how to read it.<eos> Slope, velocity, a little bit of simple geometry...<eos> It shouldn't be that difficult, okay?<eos> I mean, shouldn't be Aristotle to play a game.<eos> Am I allowed to talk, or is that a members-only privilege?<eos> Typically, caddies don't speak. Caddy?<eos> I'm not your caddy.<eos> And golf isn't a game, it's a sport.
There you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was some nice shooting out there, Wanda.<eos> You know, you made the board.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I noticed your limp.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Oh, that.<eos> No, I fell off my horse about a month ago.<eos> Guess it just didn't heal right.
Cop bar called Morty's.<eos> He was last seen leaving there about 1:30 in the morning.<eos> So you've been looking into this already.<eos> Well, when Gallo went missing, I started to have my suspicions, but without a body,<eos> I couldn't get very far.<eos> Well, do me a favor, next time you have your suspicions make sure you run 'em by me. I'm head of this case now.<eos> Julian Molina.<eos> Says here you're the right hand to the leader of La Serpiente.<eos> If that's what your little piece of paper tells you, it must be true.<eos> It also tells me, within the past month, you received two parking violations and a citation for littering.
You know, I don't think so.<eos> I'm gonna head upstairs.<eos> This Hare Krishna handed me a pamphlet about karma.<eos> Been meaning to check it out, so...<eos> Cow brains.<eos> Maybe they're right.<eos> Maybe I'm chasing ghosts.<eos> I mean, I actually thought. Suzuki had a human brain in his freezer.<eos> That's crazy, isn't it?<eos> You seem disappointed it's not human.
I love it round here.<eos> Um... w-why are we stopping?<eos> This is what we're doing.<eos> I booked us into a cheese workshop.<eos> What do you mean, a cheese workshop?<eos> A cheese workshop.<eos> We're going to make cheese.<eos> You can't make cheese in a night, it takes, like, a year to make a cheese.<eos> You've been hoodwinked.<eos> Well, y-you don't fully make your own cheese, you learn... a, it's like a cheese-appreciation course.
But she was right. And I did care.<eos> It's nice to smell it again.<eos> I'm going to wait outside.<eos> This is a better table.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> I wanted to start getting our finances in order, cos I'm thinking about...<eos> - What's this?<eos> - What's this?<eos> It's your money. Rather, it's a spreadsheet explaining how your money is mingling with other money and growing, making little money babies.<eos> Having much more fun than if it was sitting in some savings account.
Sometimes I think people travel just so they can talk about it later.<eos> That was a great trip.<eos> Remember at that restaurant?<eos> You told the waiter you had to take a crÃªpe.<eos> You got to tell that one at my funeral.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Ooh, someone's wedding.<eos> Jen, you look so pretty.<eos> I love that dress.<eos> Thanks, yeah, it's Vera Wong.
Clemmy, that doesn't sound like you.<eos> Well, we just think that we were both born with certain assets that will let us succeed even without college.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Tyler, you-you have to go to college.<eos> That's how you can have a career.<eos> - Relax, babe, I got this.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Listen, buddy, college is...<eos> It's about a lot more than just education.<eos> - It's about life experience. - Yes.
What did you expect my room to be like?<eos> I don't know, cooler?<eos> "Hai Lai," I'm sorry to burst your bubble.<eos> I'm a nerd just like you.<eos> Buenos noches.<eos> All the donations have helped a lot to change the place a little bit.<eos> We have here the washer and dryer.<eos> Huh, the... yeah, finally somebody appreciated it.<eos> And my room is totally reconstructed.<eos> My new library, my new bed, the TV, and it's... it's very cozy, isn't it, Hailey?
What is the most important part of such a tree?<eos> The many branches and the flowering.<eos> I speak of legacy.<eos> Thank you for untangling your elusive metaphor.<eos> We begin with roots.<eos> May I ask a question?<eos> Do.<eos> If you wish calligraphy on your wall, why not summon a painter who can see?<eos> Can you not read the character I made?<eos> It is a symbol for fire.

Mr. Hillegas, when was the first time that you heard your friend Teresa had gone missing?<eos> Scott had called me and said that Teresa's dad had went over and asked if he had seen Teresa, and Scott called me and I went over to the house that afternoon and we printed off her cell phone records off the Internet.<eos> Just to see, you know, calls she had made or, you know, if there were other numbers of friends that we could find on there.<eos> Finding her cell phone records, how does something like that occur?<eos> Um... well, there were a couple of us that tried figuring it out, but basically I figured out her password and made up a user name that worked and got into her... her phone records and, I mean, they printed right off.<eos> Now, tell me about this online search.<eos> She had never shared her password with you?<eos> [Hillegas] No.<eos> [Buting] So you just went online to Cingular Wireless or whatever, dot com, and just guessed her password?<eos> Well, we had just kind of figured that it would... apparently be something relating to her sisters.
But you didn't hear it hit the floor when it... whenever it got there, right?<eos> Correct.<eos> The floor's carpeted.<eos> Well, can I drop it on the floor here?<eos> [Kratz] What are we doing, Judge?<eos> Is this an experiment in front of the jury?<eos> If it is, then we need to replicate the conditions.<eos> [Buting] That's fine.<eos> We'll hold off on that.<eos> The bookcase hasn't come in so I don't know if they intend to introduce it or not, but it's not here.
[Buting] That's fine.<eos> We'll hold off on that.<eos> The bookcase hasn't come in so I don't know if they intend to introduce it or not, but it's not here.<eos> [Strang] Lieutenant Lenk, November 8 was at least your third time into Mr. Avery's bedroom.<eos> Searching it. Right?<eos> That's correct.<eos> Now, you had been the first one to empty out that bookcase?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - OK.<eos> But you know that somebody searched it on November 5.
Yeah, but it didn't make sense what I said. No.<eos> - You...<eos> - Do you watch two on five? - Mm...<eos> That's what it sounded like I said.<eos> Yeah, I'm hoping next week for a verdict. Not this week.<eos> - No, I'd sooner have it next week.<eos> - Yeah. That way they... can think about all that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you figure they'll... they'll do it tomorrow, too.
[female reporter] Do you think that's some kind of compromise by the jury?<eos> I... You know, you'd have to ask jurors that.<eos> Um, but... I can't explain how one would arrive at, um, what clearly seemed to be inconsistent verdicts.<eos> It's not the first time that's ever happened though either.<eos> You talked about this process as potentially being redemptive and you get a little emotional about it. I mean, now you've been through this process.<eos> - Was it the redemption you'd hoped for?<eos> Redemption will have to wait, as it so often does in human affairs.<eos> Um... it just will have to wait.<eos> Our criminal justice system failed Steven Avery badly in 1985.<eos> It failed him time and time again after 1985.
I want to draw your attention to a news report from Channel 26 that says, "We have a 16-year-old who, while morally and legally responsible, was heavily influenced by someone that can only be described as something close to evil incarnate." Right?<eos> That's what it says I said, but that wasn't me.<eos> OK. Um...<eos> Is there anything about this statement that bothers you?<eos> To say that we have a 16-year-old who's morally and legally responsible, that would in effect admit guilt and that is something you should definitely not say.<eos> Just for the record, Your Honor, Mr. Kachinsky testified that he did not make those comments and this exhibit is being introduced as impeachment evidence to demonstrate that in fact Mr. Kachinsky made those comments.<eos> The court will receive it.<eos> Attorney Len Kachinsky immediately lashed out at Steven Avery.<eos> We have a 16-year-old who, while morally and legally responsible, was heavily influenced by someone that can only be described as something close to evil incarnate.<eos> And, uh, the next day, you make the statement that "if the confession is valid and admissible as evidence, it would almost certainly result in a conviction."
I had, you know, a couple of boxes in my cell, then the other ones were stored in a... in a room.<eos> So when I got done with some boxes, then I could put 'em back and get some more boxes.<eos> That's why it's so hard to work on a big case like this.<eos> You can't have it all when you need it.<eos> Sometimes in the middle of the night I'd think of something and I had to go search.<eos> Sometimes you go... you want to say, nuts.<eos> But something just bugs you and you gotta do it. You gotta get up and do it.<eos> I wrote the Innocence Project... if the Innocence Project would help me again.<eos> I wrote 'em a few times... but they won't take my case.<eos> Then there's that blood, if I could prove that it came from the courthouse.
You guys should get back to work.<eos> Oh, man, I got the cramps something bad.<eos> - Really?<eos> Are your breasts tender?<eos> - No, but I can't feel my balls!<eos> Murphy, ma'am.<eos> Frank Murphy.<eos> Well, Frank Murphy, you're about to lose your job!<eos> Excuse me, sir? Um...<eos> I don't know your name, obviously, but um, I found this bottle by the baggage carousel and just thought it might be important?
You're the top Plast-A-Ware neighborhood sales - liaison for September!<eos> - [gasps] Gee, this is so special.<eos> I haven't won anything since my high school softball team went to State.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Look at this.<eos> What is it?<eos> - It's a telephone answering machine.<eos> - A what? When you're not home, the machine will answer the phone and let the caller leave a message on cassette tape.<eos> It helps me keep track of my orders.<eos> And it's the official answering machine of NASA.
[answering machine beeps] Hello, there. You are a shit-eating scab turncoat.<eos> It's for Dad!<eos> Yeah, yeah. It's funny because we're friends.<eos> OK, OK, so then you hang up the phone, you call back, and with this little beepy thing, we can hear your message.<eos> [Bob] ...put those baggage donkeys back in their pen!<eos> Oops. [chuckles] Went back too far.<eos> [Frank] It, uh, breaks my heart to tell you, but, uh... she decided to turn it down.<eos> - [Vivian] Really? - [Frank] Afraid so.<eos> She said there's no job more important than being a mother to three beautiful miracles.<eos> Wow, it records everything you say.
We'll just do a couple streets, and then we'll run back home.<eos> - What if he sees us?<eos> - He's not gonna see us.<eos> It's dark and we'll be wearing costumes. OK? - OK.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah. Get your costume on!<eos> Well, I warned you about wearing a costume!<eos> Can I go trick-or-treating now?<eos> Pretty soon, sweetheart, but first we're gonna play a new game.<eos> It's called "Look for cars that look like Mom's car."
- No problem.<eos> Pinglet!<eos> There goes the other one.<eos> What a plague!<eos> Paillardin, come watch my wife try on clothes. It'll be fun.<eos> Why isn't Mr. Moulineau here to do the alterations?<eos> The tailor sends his apologies. He had to go to the country and sent me instead.<eos> This coat looks awful. It bunches.<eos> Yes!<eos> It bunches quite a bit!

I'm not talking to you!<eos> I'm talking to these two!<eos> And this hotel, what a hotel! What a hotel!<eos> An old hovel with cracks everywhere.<eos> With fleas!<eos> "Fleas?"<eos> No!<eos> We spray powder every day.<eos> Let's talk about your powder!<eos> It makes the fleas stronger and suffocates the guests!
There's noise every night, awful noise!<eos> The walls crack, the furniture jumps...<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> I came here to see for myself. You don't have to tell me.<eos> I'll see for myself.<eos> Let's see this room.<eos> It's over here. Follow me, please.<eos> I'll give you this candle.<eos> Let's see this haunted room.<eos> Here it is, sir.
Yes, yes.<eos> I came here to see for myself. You don't have to tell me.<eos> I'll see for myself.<eos> Let's see this room.<eos> It's over here. Follow me, please.<eos> I'll give you this candle.<eos> Let's see this haunted room.<eos> Here it is, sir.<eos> I'd rather you sleep here than me.<eos> It seems quiet for a room where ghosts are making noise.
And don't scream so loud!<eos> People are sleeping!<eos> I don't want to stay here one more minute.<eos> As soon as Pinglet gets back...<eos> I can't wait to lie down.<eos> My hat! Where is my hat?<eos> When you've traveled all day...<eos> Did I throw it here, with Pinglet's things?<eos> I like this hotel.<eos> It has an old-fashioned, authentic quality that I like.
I remember they were singing,<eos> You sleeping there Under this white gravestone<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> It's us, the ghosts It's us, the ghosts<eos> Oh, oh!<eos> Go ahead, laugh!<eos> Then I packed my things and ran away like a madman!<eos> When suddenly, in front of a door, I saw what I thought were humans.<eos> My God, that room!<eos> - It was number 10.
When suddenly, in front of a door, I saw what I thought were humans.<eos> My God, that room!<eos> - It was number 10.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why 10 and not another number?<eos> Why another number and not 10?<eos> Let's say it was number 10.<eos> I ran inside.<eos> There was a woman, or something with the form of a woman, with a dress...<eos> I couldn't see her face. She put my hat over it.
"creature of the black lagoon" type of thing. But I also need expressions and to do some kind of funny stuff with the monster. So he's got to be more moldable.<eos> Rather than go through a 10-hour process of covering someone in head-to-toe, we took the approach of making it all as large prosthetic appliances.<eos> We're pre-painting everything in my shop. When we went to set, it was just a matter of assembling the puzzle.<eos> The special effects makeup guy, you know monsters.<eos> That's what they live for -- they turn into a monster.<eos> They become their own creation.<eos> Did that just happen?<eos> A decade of my life in this office in search of the truth.<eos> And all the time, I was being led by my nose through a dark alley to a dead end, exactly as they planned.<eos> The poster has become so iconic, it's really the heart of the show.
It will be your undoing, Mulder.<eos> I like the intimate scenes between Mulder and Scully that bring us closer together, adding to the history of the series.<eos> Listen to me -- as your friend and as a physician, you are on dangerous ground here.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> You could possibly make 12 different shows out of this show.<eos> It's a very flexible frame in terms of tonality, in terms of action, in terms of mythology, in terms of subject matter.<eos> It can go a lot of different ways.<eos> And the fans, I think, like all those ways that it goes.<eos> Did it look anything like this?<eos> The thing I saw only had two eyes, and it was wearing underwear.
Everything is different.<eos> You know, maybe things could change.<eos> Talk to some of the girls?<eos> Two are better than one, and 10 is better than two.<eos> Wait, Alex, Alex, before you go on, let me just...<eos> I agree.<eos> Look, Ryan's got a great arm, but he's a kid. He's got no play...<eos> Oh, no, do I smell like garlic?<eos> Oh, if you do, I do.<eos> Look, let me tell you who the real star is. - It's Gil Hodges.
Yes, and as I said, we are all very thankful for your quick thinking and cat like reflexes.<eos> Uh, here is my token of gratitude, per your request.<eos> Now, when you copy that out, do not change a word.<eos> It took me four drafts to get it right.<eos> Forgive the spelling. It's not my strong suit.<eos> "At night I recall your glorious smile. "Those twinned...<eos> twined..." "At night I recall your glorious smile. "That twinned, upturned of mirth and abandon,<eos> "and silvery dream, and I feel anything is possible." It's good, isn't it?<eos> I think I may have fallen a little bit in love with her myself while I was writing them.<eos> Evelyn's smile isn't glorious. It's kind of crooked.
Just lie on your back and close your eyes.<eos> Imagine you and William standing in the bedroom. Are you imagining it?<eos> - Yes. - What's happening?<eos> - What's happening? - Yeah, describe it.<eos> We're standing in the bedroom.<eos> - I'm wearing a white dress.<eos> - Yeah, good.<eos> Continue.<eos> Okay! The dress is almost similar to a Stella McCartney dress with lace at the bottom.<eos> But it doesn't have lace at the bottom.
Really sure?<eos> It'll get better.<eos> Black Swan?<eos> I can't handle us breaking up.<eos> The thing is that Ingrid's brother is a dealer.<eos> - Dealer of what?<eos> - Greens.<eos> Have you started smoking marijuana? Huh?<eos> Why?<eos> You're reacting as if it was heroin.
[Darren] Our first night dive on Pete's was the culmination of all the planning and negotiation and practice of painting with light on George's.<eos> All of that work had gone into creating this one very very special moment and we had twenty minutes at 27 metres.<eos> Gliding above the wreck looking at the details through the beam of the torch, the colour and the amount of life that had been attracted to her, it was like I was visualising and building the picture as I swam.<eos> - [Darren] Wow. - [Abe] Fantastic.<eos> - [Darren] Yeah how 'bout that.<eos> - [Abe] You're happy with it?<eos> - [Darren] Yeah beautiful sight.<eos> [Darren] The most challenging images are always the most satisfying and to create this picture over so many days was just the most amazing experience.<eos> [narrator] Darren's image of Pete's Bi-plane captures an ethereal beauty that is truly unforgettable.<eos> But it also highlights that an old machine built for death and destruction has now become home to an array of soft corals and invertebrates that continue to support life on Rabaul's sea floor.
[narrator] Africa is home to an incredible diversity of environments and living creatures.<eos> The open plains of the Masai Mara provide perfect conditions for Art to get closer to the action than ever before.<eos> [Art] So this is my 38th trip to the Mara and the first time I've been able to get above the land.<eos> East Africa in late August and now in the month of September, it's all about the migration.<eos> [narrator] The great wildebeest populations of East Africa perform a spectacular annual migration.<eos> An endless quest for the fresh rains and the new pastures that follow.<eos> While having the appearance of a frenzy, research has shown a herd of wildebeest possesses what is known as "swarm intelligence", whereby the animals systematically explore and overcome obstacles as one.<eos> [Art] For me it's not so much the biology of the migration, but it's the graphic nature, it's the patterns.<eos> It renders the scene into something much more, ah, like a painting in my mind.<eos> So when you have a subject, and light, and atmospheric conditions like a herd of wildebeests, it just comes alive in terms of the graphic nature of it and that's really the first thing I ever want to shoot -
This is just one of the most amazing sights I've ever seen.<eos> [gentle music] [gentle music] [gentle music] [narrator] Adelie penguins are one of only five species of penguin living on continental Antarctica.<eos> Their colonies are found in areas of sloping rock that allows drainage for their nests during the melt of the summer months.<eos> Scientists have recorded that Adelie numbers have been increasing in recent years with a population now estimated at over two and a half million breeding pairs.<eos> [Peter] People have all sorts of different ideas about shooting in Antarctica, and it's easy in many ways to get great shots.<eos> The wildlife is just uninhibited, it doesn't worry about humans, which means it's a great opportunity with a camera because they're not worried about it, they're not worried about you and you just get these amazing opportunities -<eos> [gentle music] [gentle music] [gentle music] [gentle music] [gentle music] We've got some wonderful brash ice, just broken up bits of ice just along the foreshore here.<eos> And the angle that I've got, has got a little bit of a S curve which leads up to this amazing panorama out there.<eos> I guess it looks like the whole of the ice pat coming down from Antarctica.<eos> Photography is all about being in the right place at the right time - sometimes you can engineer it yourself, but sometimes it just happens.
"Well I'm trying to communicate a sense of what it is like."<eos> [Peter] Yes. And yet the military allowed journalists, allowed writers, allowed painters who could create a reality according to their mind.<eos> And yet a photographer had a different set of rules to abide by.<eos> [Peter] Photographers have a contract with society in that when people see photographs, many of them have an expectation that it is real.<eos> So if you're a documentary photographer, I think you need to respect that.<eos> But when you're using photography as art, as I am, then the only limitation is your imagination.<eos> [narrator] As Hurley and his cameras remained on Elephant Island, it is our imagination that is required to picture the gruelling scenes of Shackleton in an open lifeboat trying to reach a land called South Georgia.<eos> Whereas Shackleton saw South Georgia as his hope for salvation; today Peter sees it as the jewel in the crown of his photographic journey.<eos> [Peter] While Antarctica is undoubtedly an amazing location, for me, the highlight has always been South Georgia.<eos> It's like the Himalayas reaching down to the ocean with nothing in between.

[Peter] If there is one word I like to emphasise, it's simplicity.<eos> How do we get this photograph to tell a single story, so that we can communicate with our viewer.<eos> And I think if you nail simplicity, then a lot of the other aspects of composition and light, well, they just fall into place automatically.<eos> [Peter] The real challenge when you're presented with an amazing scene like this, is to be able to take something home with you that correctly captures the mood and the experience of really being there.<eos> [uplifting music] [uplifting music] [narrator] Peter's journey to Antarctica and South Georgia, following in footsteps and inspiration of Frank Hurley has been beyond his wildest dreams.<eos> It's now time for him to make the long journey across the Southern Ocean and return home.<eos> [Peter] I realise my voyage is coming to an end, but in many ways it's just the beginning.<eos> Strange as it may seem, I can't wait to get back home and put these photographs up on my monitor.<eos> That for me is when the magic starts.<eos> Photography is not just about capture, it's also about interpreting, about showing to other people what it is that you felt about what you photographed.
[narrator] Every Powerful photograph... has a powerful photograph behind it.<eos> Travel Photographer Richard I'Anson goes behind the scenes of Buddhist rituals in Bhutan... where he has heard of a sacred fire festival that appears to swallow people whole.<eos> [Richard] The structure behind me will be set alight.<eos> I've never seen it before, it should be absolutely spectacular.
I've never seen it before, it should be absolutely spectacular.<eos> [narrator] Richard then travels to a remote region in Northern India searching for the holy-grail of wildlife photography - the snow leopard.<eos> [Richard] It definitely feels a bit like a needle in a haystack.<eos> But we've got a great team, and we're looking forward to giving it our best shot.<eos> [narrator] He then ventures south to capture one of the world's most colourful religious events - the festival of Holi.<eos> It's really hard conditions to work in - being attacked with coloured powder!<eos> [uplifting music] [uplifting music] [uplifting music]<eos> [Richard] The first photo I ever took was a travel photo,<eos> I was ten and I was on my first big overseas trip.<eos> I remember that moment when I took that picture as though it were yesterday.
We're here watching the final preparations for tomorrow night's fire blessing ceremony which is part of one of Bhutan's most spectacular festivals.<eos> This structure behind me will be set alight and the local people run through in order to wash away their sins.<eos> I've never seen it before, it should be absolutely spectacular.<eos> I can't wait to photograph it.<eos> [narrator] In the evening crowds pour into the Jambay Lhakhang to witness the fire ceremony.<eos> Fires are lit to exorcise evil and then the festival begins with the dance of the black hats.<eos> They then move into a field adjacent to the monastery where the structure that was build is ignited.<eos> This ancient ritual is said to purify all those who enter the structure.<eos> Bhutanese from around the region flock to brave the flaming archway... hoping to bring good luck and prosperity for the coming year.<eos> That was awesome, it went from a very sacred, ah, religious festival to sort of absolute chaos as they set fire to the structure and all the people came running through.
It's all right.<eos> Everything will be all right.<eos> Miss Elbe.<eos> It's time.<eos> Good luck, everybody.<eos> Swab, quick.<eos> Professor Warnekros would like a word.<eos> She lost a lot of blood.<eos> Now we are struggling to keep the fever down.<eos> There's a chance it might burn itself out, but...
Mason, Mom's home!<eos> Mom's home!<eos> Mom's home.<eos> Mom!<eos> Hi!<eos> Look at this owl Daddy gave me!<eos> Isn't it cool?<eos> See, its head spins!<eos> And look at this bracelet.<eos> It was made by Indians in Alaska.
- Okay.<eos> There you go.<eos> Pass out the goodies.<eos> This is for the girls.<eos> Don't worry, we got you some absinthe.<eos> It's in the...<eos> Let's pour.<eos> You take this big elevator up, and when we got to the top, we flew a paper airplane off.<eos> - And what happened?<eos> - It flew!

Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I just wanted you to back me up on that so I'm not the only one yelling at them all the time.<eos> Okay, I back you up.<eos> You guys got that?<eos> We all agree, everybody agrees, right?<eos> Tomorrow, chores?<eos> They don't hear it. Goes in one ear and out the other.<eos> But, Dad, I mean, dusting is pointless.<eos> It's not pointless, you just don't like to do it.
All right!<eos> Looks good!<eos> How many you got left, two?<eos> All right, all right, we're done.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Come on, Sam.<eos> Go get that McCain sign, would you?<eos> What?<eos> Get the McCain sign.<eos> Go rip it up, come on.
But don't tell LeeAnne I told you that. She'd kill me.<eos> I won't.<eos> Well, I better get going.<eos> See you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> His cognitive theories, his interviews with orphans, ethology theorists' work, and then he in turn was supported strongly by Harry Harlow's rhesus monkey study.<eos> Now, you guys, you gotta think, this is the 1950s, this was radical!<eos> This flew in the face of traditional learning theory, of B.F. Skinner's classical and instrumental conditioning.<eos> Now, Bowlby's gonna argue that human survival depends on us falling in love.<eos> It depends on me falling in love with my mother and my mother falling in love with me.
Just, you know, sleep over there.<eos> I'm not gay.<eos> Give it some time, man.<eos> You'll realize.<eos> Fuck y'all.<eos> See, that's exactly my point, man.<eos> Nah, but we don't have whores coming over.<eos> We were just fucking with you to see what you'd say.<eos> And you just earned your vag badge.<eos> Put it next to your bitch card.
You don't have to listen to your parents after you turn 18.<eos> Especially if they're not helping you financially.<eos> That's what I figured.<eos> But living in a dorm isn't so bad.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I mean, especially if it's a coed dorm. Yeah.<eos> I mean, I've never been around so many cute guys at once.<eos> Like, college is really fun.<eos> I'm excited.<eos> It's great, yeah.
I know, I know, right?<eos> It's gonna be 15 years till I have an empty nest.<eos> But I'd love to pitch in, help with this, if I could.<eos> I mean, it's so great that you did this.<eos> Can I just give you a little?<eos> I'd appreciate it if I could.<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I don't have any cash.<eos> I know, it's in Annie's purse.
I L word you too.<eos> Okay.<eos> Talk to you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Did you just use the L word with Dick?<eos> We said it last night.<eos> Jen!<eos> That's great!<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Well, you know. You finally went on a date and it was so awful.
Okay, we'll see.<eos> Let's get your gloves up. Face protected.<eos> Kick his ass, Brendan!<eos> - What's that?<eos> -Kick his ass, Jim!<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> You see, you gotta look at your target.<eos> How about I put a picture of your babysitter on my face? Will you look at it then?
Then it is still there?<eos> Gone.<eos> As my hatred is.<eos> I... will haunt you.<eos> In the old days, there was a ceremony. Flags. Magnificent horns.<eos> Could be a bit silly with just the two of us.<eos> Did it hurt?<eos> No.<eos> So you choose this life?<eos> It chose me.
Send in a nickel, win the big contest!" How dare you!<eos> Lots of people will like this.<eos> Well, nobody who's walking through the doors of this gallery.<eos> Now, please, clear out the clutter before the taste police arrive.<eos> We'll never break in!<eos> There's a secret society of gallery owners and critics who get together for Sunday brunch in Sausalito deciding what's "cool."<eos> Like McCarthy, in his hearings:<eos> "I anoint that painter.<eos> I banish that painter to Nowheresville."<eos> I think people buy art because it touches them.
Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation.<eos> Miss Crawford, in recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting on you.<eos> The cat is out of the bag.<eos> I can reveal that our local luminary, Walter Keane, is opening his own gallery.<eos> Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this.<eos> I remember when Mama painted that.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> That would have been a while ago.<eos> Sure I'm sure.<eos> It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on the stool in the kitchen.
Something to do with your son, with you.<eos> Why do they want you dead?<eos> How should I know?<eos> Same reason you do.<eos> Look. Something's going on.<eos> They used my family as bait to find you.<eos> Now, I want to know why.<eos> Did you take my lighter?<eos> No.<eos> Well, where is it?
Ah, he's moving.<eos> "Batting Practice"?<eos> Let's get a look at his swing.<eos> Take that gun and shoot that fucking dog, will you?<eos> She's cute, man.<eos> Is this your first- ask her if this is her first time.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> Uh, I'm in Houston, and everything's fine.<eos> I got a meeting in a little while.<eos> I'll call you later and let you know how it went.
- Laine, we're only trying to help you.<eos> - You can't.<eos> I'm not even sure who can.<eos> Trevor.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> All of us.<eos> You made us play.<eos> Now, Isabelle's dead.<eos> I know, and I'll never forgive myself.<eos> This thing, it's haunting us, wherever we go, watching everything we do.
- You can't.<eos> I'm not even sure who can.<eos> Trevor.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> All of us.<eos> You made us play.<eos> Now, Isabelle's dead.<eos> I know, and I'll never forgive myself.<eos> This thing, it's haunting us, wherever we go, watching everything we do.<eos> It's coming for all of us.
Viktor Cherevin is completely unpredictable.<eos> And it's Russia.<eos> Insider trading is legal over there.<eos> It's the Wild West.<eos> They're still ideologues, but the new ideology is money.<eos> They're not a country, they're a corporation.<eos> Which is why we're there in the first place.<eos> - I know, don't rock the boat.<eos> - It's not a boat.<eos> It's a goddamn luxury yacht and we're all on it together.
- Yeah, I think someone should.<eos> - You think we can?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Put it up, the restaurant.<eos> The orders to sell the dollar would be encrypted on the computer of the security director.<eos> Dimitri Lemkov?<eos> Former FSB.<eos> We can't break into his office.<eos> It's secured six different ways.
