Why are you in our chapel?<eos> We worship God here.<eos> We've been found.<eos> So have I.<eos> I believe.<eos> We don't want you here.<eos> Why not?<eos> Aren't all believers welcome?<eos> You don't believe.<eos> Yes, I do.
Nah. Regis scared him by telling him about the video.<eos> I want to know who he came running to about it.<eos> We have a fucking problem.<eos> Do you know that somewhere in this building there is a shipment of Justin Bieber wigs?<eos> I'm not mocking your being bald.<eos> You're always so fucking amused.<eos> We all make choices.<eos> Like when I chose to believe you that Crystal Harris didn't know<eos> I killed that hacker chick? Well, guess what.<eos> She does.
Amos is different.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, very different.<eos> But he's not crazy and he's not evil.<eos> He's just always needed someone to help him out with the world.<eos> And he picked you.<eos> Congrats.<eos> Do you know that old story, Pinocchio?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
How many targets can it track simultaneously?<eos> 300, with the ability to engage 36 of them at any one time.<eos> I'm... I'm free to go?<eos> You can go, but you're not free.<eos> Copies of these photographs can be e-mailed to everyone on your contact list at any time.<eos> Understood?<eos> Something you should know.<eos> What?<eos> Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon.<eos> It never did.
The number that Sekou gave us has been disconnected, but we have to find him, because the money he gave your son looks very bad.<eos> I don't know him.<eos> Simone?<eos> Uh, no, Mum.<eos> I never even heard of him.<eos> You sure he exists?<eos> He exists.<eos> He gave your son $5,000.<eos> Sekou don't have $5,000.<eos> He does, ma'am.
Nothing.<eos> Now you have.<eos> I didn't say I wanted to hear from you.<eos> I said I expected it.<eos> - Is this about the bomb?<eos> - No.<eos> Tovah Rivlin, Mossad agent.<eos> I need what you have on her... Movements and contacts for the past two weeks.<eos> So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.
Let me go in and talk to him.<eos> He's already got two hostages.<eos> - I'm not gonna give him a third.<eos> - I'm telling you--<eos> They're not hostages and he's not a shooter!<eos> When I left this morning, I asked him to protect my daughter.<eos> And he is!<eos> From people throwing rocks, from this army you've got out here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do!
I know he does.<eos> You know what they're calling it--<eos> "Escape From New York."<eos> Because while New Yorkers were dealing with this terrible attack, the president-elect fled to a "secure location."<eos> Still undisclosed.<eos> General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.<eos> That's right.<eos> You had a plane come right through your office window.<eos> Where did you run to?<eos> - We didn't.
Well, her father had red hair, and... and she has red hair, so at first, whenever I looked, what I'd see...<eos> What I'd see was that he wasn't there.<eos> She reminded you of his absence.<eos> Not just that.<eos> Of my role in his not being there.<eos> I knew where everything was heading.<eos> I... I knew.<eos> And I pushed him toward that.<eos> I-I really... I really don't like this.<eos> No one does.
Carrie.<eos> Please.<eos> I will come right to the point.<eos> How would you feel about making our arrangement permanent?<eos> - How would I feel?<eos> - An official title--<eos> Senior Advisor to the President, and an office in the West Wing.<eos> It would be the greatest honor of my career.<eos> I know you had your concerns about even coming on temporarily.<eos> I did, yeah.
You'll want to hear this.<eos> That was Brett O'Keefe on the phone.<eos> He says he made the video.<eos> He admits it now when we already know?<eos> He says he's responding to your call to come out of hiding.<eos> He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.<eos> No debate, no prep, just two people talking.<eos> His words.<eos> Which, obviously, you don't want to do.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
I'm so f-fucked up... up here, I thought she came to hurt me.<eos> I took the bullets out of her gun, and she couldn't defend herself when he came.<eos> I killed her.<eos> No, you did not.<eos> You did not.<eos> That guy did.<eos> Listen, okay?<eos> When Pallis gets here, you need to tell him what you just told me.<eos> I-I know... I know it won't be easy, but at least I understand, now, what happened here.<eos> You don't.
I killed her.<eos> No, you did not.<eos> You did not.<eos> That guy did.<eos> Listen, okay?<eos> When Pallis gets here, you need to tell him what you just told me.<eos> I-I know... I know it won't be easy, but at least I understand, now, what happened here.<eos> You don't.<eos> - Quinn--<eos> - You don't.
- Yeah, absolutely.<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> Oh, my God... how many people even come to an orgy?<eos> Well, I don't want to brag, but Pablo only really invites the elite, usually from the Broadway sphere, so it'll be small, probably like 15.<eos> I think it's gonna be a really good way for me to network.<eos> Why don't you just take an acting class?<eos> Shut up, Marnie!<eos> What do I look like, Ryan Dillon Davidson? Pff!<eos> - I don't know who that is.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Yeah, but if he's close by...<eos> Honey, I don't know where he is.<eos> And if he wanted me to know, he would've fucking told me.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book.<eos> It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.<eos> Are you finally gonna read it?<eos> - I already did.
Hey.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Wh... Michael?<eos> He's fine.<eos> He's just sleeping.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's true...<eos> I borrowed your pills.<eos> Looks real.<eos> Indeed, it does.
- Did you tell him?<eos> - Nora?<eos> - Did you tell him?<eos> I... I don't understand what you're asking me.<eos> Kevin, fucking Kevin.<eos> - He found me.<eos> - What?<eos> He's... He's there in Australia?<eos> Did you tell him where I was, Laurie?<eos> No, I didn't.
Over here, we lost some of them.<eos> But over there, they lost all of us.<eos> So, I went and did what I came there to do.<eos> I went to find my kids.<eos> Planes don't really fly over there.<eos> They have enough resources, just not enough pilots.<eos> So, I found a boat that would take me.<eos> No boats go directly from Australia to New York, so it took me a long time to get there.<eos> A long time.<eos> But I finally did.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Look at her.<eos> Look at her.<eos> She had no idea, did she?<eos> Can't feel my arms.<eos> You won't.<eos> You won't feel anything anymore.<eos> Just like I don't.
Ben told me to come alone.<eos> He spots anyone he even thinks might be with the government, he will bolt.<eos> I'll make sure the tac team stays hidden.<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay?<eos> He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> Eric, you and I were operating alone because we didn't know who we could trust.<eos> Now we do.
And send out an interagency alert, code one.<eos> What's happened?<eos> I just spoke with Henry Donovan.<eos> Luis Diaz is gone.<eos> He assaulted Henry and fled the premises.<eos> Y-You need to send an ambulance out to the estate.<eos> Right away.<eos> I need to take this.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How we doing?
I saved your men's lives and yours from the fight you started but could not finish.<eos> And now you would start another that no man can hope to finish?<eos> Then leave.<eos> But what's happening here is going to happen.<eos> This war is going to begin.<eos> This camp is going to fight it with or without you.<eos> They may call you a king, but only in the kingdom that is no more.<eos> We're all free men here.<eos> And I wish to stay that way.<eos> As do we all.
Follow me, please, Captain.<eos> Those men at that table are among the wealthiest in the Pennsylvania Colony and critical suppliers to my husband's business.<eos> They consider character to be of paramount importance in choosing their partners, and so my husband has gone to great lengths to assure them that our family's sordid beginnings are long since behind us, and you just stood in front of them<eos> and proposed that my husband join you in a revenge plot against the royal governor of New Providence Island.<eos> I'm afraid I may have fumbled my case, then, ma'am, but the merits of it remain and exist well beyond revenge.<eos> If you could help me gain your husband's ear again, this time in private, outside the presence of those other men...<eos> My husband's commercial interests have grown 12-fold in the past three years.<eos> By some estimates, the estate represents the ninth largest family fortune in the Americas.<eos> Does that sound like something built by a man who would discard an opportunity as promising as this because of what the neighbors might think?<eos> No, it doesn't.
He told me to go fuck myself.<eos> Well, that does not sound good.<eos> The business isn't his.<eos> Well, the horses are his, the cart is his, but it appears the wife is the one holding the reins.<eos> Eleanor's grandmother?<eos> And she is interested.<eos> She invited me to return this evening to provide details of our proposal.<eos> Prove that we can be trusted to manage Nassau in the event of Rogers' removal.<eos> And I think you should come with me.<eos> You do?
And still, you will not say yes.<eos> So I come to you one last time, to ensure you cannot say no.<eos> - Accept the treaty...<eos> - I will consider no treaty of yours.<eos> And John Silver lives.<eos> Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.<eos> The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.<eos> Do not make the same mistake I did.<eos> Do the deal.
I am trying to engineer a future with a species that is more violent, intolerant and possessive than any species in the history of this planet.<eos> Sapiens live in a world designed by their worst fears.<eos> And nothing terrifies them like difference.<eos> You save your fucking justifications.<eos> You murdered an innocent girl.<eos> I know you killed Sara Patrell.<eos> Who?<eos> There will always be unfortunate necessities during the construction of a monument such as this.<eos> I thought a cop would understand that.<eos> Angelica did.
- How long has he been after you?<eos> - A year.<eos> - A year?<eos> - That has to be a lie.<eos> - Maybe the Cannibal is getting slow.<eos> - The Cannibal?<eos> Clustercide.<eos> Story is he ate his own.<eos> - Do you know his real name?<eos> - No one does.

Sure.<eos> Sun.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> Stop crying.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's not that bad.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't...
We first considered hacking an invite, but because the police set-up is concentrated on the people coming through the front door...<eos> Security is so performative.<eos> From what we can tell, they're not even checking the staff.<eos> Just like the TSA.<eos> Which means, we found a back door, literally.<eos> The fake ID is a breeze.<eos> There is only one little problem...<eos> Do you know anything about tending bar?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> She doesn't, does she?
Oh, yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> [sighs] Sun.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I don't know. [exhales] [sobbing]<eos> Stop crying.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's not that bad.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't...

Get ready, boss, because you'll have loads of work when I come.<eos> I'm going there with my wife this year.<eos> So what?<eos> And with our daughter.<eos> Miska...<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> So do I.<eos> We can't do it at the expense of my child though.<eos> You said you loved me.<eos> I do.
First one in the lot this morning.<eos> You showed up early to take a look around, didn't you?<eos> See what really caused this.<eos> Unless you believe that whole "fire extinguisher malfunction flood" bullshit.<eos> - You won't stop with this.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - That was no heart attack.<eos> - Who had a heart attack?<eos> - Clemenza.<eos> Only he didn't.
Find somewhere else to sleep, asshole.<eos> If I'm downstairs, how am I going to screw your brains out?<eos> Oh, wow. Although I have my ways.<eos> Good night, Paul.<eos> You're actually kicking me out?<eos> Exactly what did Karen say to you?<eos> We'll talk about it tomorrow.<eos> Hopefully, you'll come to your senses by then.<eos> You don't know what you're missing.<eos> Yes, I do.
They're all out there plotting your deaths.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Competitive table setting?<eos> Tablescape. It's called tablescape.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> We're in here.<eos> You know if the phone works?<eos> Oh! Merry Christmas.<eos> It does.
They found five bodies at a house in Florida.<eos> Missing a couple of hearts.<eos> Okay, just try to keep people away for a minute.<eos> - Nicely. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Hey, is this seat taken?<eos> Excuse me, sir, this is...<eos> Won't be but a moment.<eos> He's still in Richard's body.<eos> Richard doesn't care, darling.<eos> I fucking do.
In the center of your being, there's a tiny beating heart.<eos> What, you mean like my soul?<eos> Part of it, yes, the slimmest part, but it holds specific power.<eos> It's called a Shade.<eos> Shade.<eos> It's what makes you feel the pain will burn you till there's nothing.<eos> And, yes, it's also there for love, but, uh, let's be frank, darling, you're more likely to throw yourself off a bridge than ever love again.<eos> I felt that way.<eos> And I knew it crippled me when I needed to be strong.<eos> As you do now.
- Trifling-ass bitch, if you ask me, man.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - So, what's up?<eos> What you want to do now?<eos> -We're gonna do the job.<eos> -Wait up, man.<eos> I don't think that's too smart, man.<eos> There's two of them up in there now.<eos> That changes everything.<eos> -No, it doesn't.
I don't think that's too smart, man.<eos> There's two of them up in there now.<eos> That changes everything.<eos> -No, it doesn't.<eos> It's just two bodies.<eos> It's simple now.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Coming?<eos> - I thought he caught a life sentence from the Detroit job.<eos> -He did.
Hey babe!<eos> What is it?<eos> Hey Brad, you got a job yet?<eos> There's food in there.<eos> Make it!<eos> OK, wait til I come home and I'll make it.<eos> - No, no-one's going home.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - No you don't!
We'll go to Canada.<eos> No, no, no, you won't.<eos> I put up my damned house.<eos> You don't have to decide right now.<eos> Talk it over as a family.<eos> We've decided.<eos> Teena McGuire is a lying whore, no-one's gonna believer her.<eos> My boys are not pleading guilty to something they did not do.<eos> That's it!<eos> Innocent people don't do time.
What if that's the only kind of man I can raise?<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> And I'm still fucking bleeding.<eos> From my vagina.<eos> No one understands!<eos> You think no one understands you?<eos> Yeah, I do, because I made a very intense choice to take this on all by myself, okay?<eos> I decided to be brave and just go it alone...<eos> Mom, I buckle my bra every day, okay?<eos> But just do it for a second.
Just leave it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I need to reorganize that anyway.<eos> Just kick 'em aside.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'll... I'll get to it later.<eos> I have never felt such an intense need to just, like, Instagram a stranger.<eos> (Sighs) I get that a lot.<eos> You know, no one's expecting all of this in all of this.<eos> - No, they don't. - _
Wait, you stole an actual plate from the WEMUN mixer?<eos> Well, congrats, now you're even more of a dick.<eos> I'm a dick?<eos> Why am I a dick?<eos> Because I actually came here to try to help our tiny little friend here. All right?<eos> - Not steal fine china.<eos> - Oh yeah.<eos> Or someone else's fucking boyfriend.<eos> Can't believe you just said that.<eos> I did.
- Not steal fine china.<eos> - Oh yeah.<eos> Or someone else's fucking boyfriend.<eos> Can't believe you just said that.<eos> I did.<eos> Fuck. Ge...<eos> You don't even like Adam. How are you mad at me about Adam?<eos> You wouldn't even let him drink milk from your fridge.<eos> Well, that's because he has oral herpes.<eos> - Oh, no he doesn't.
Yeah, okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> So, I'm assuming that was Toni Morrison.<eos> That's funny.<eos> No, it's my ex.<eos> Very tortured woman.<eos> But our daughter is a good girl, so, you know, I have to believe that this... life, this mother, is teaching her something, you know, building her up strong, because, uh,<eos> she's had some depression stuff this year and it got kind of serious, but, um... she's good.<eos> - Listen, I don't know you...<eos> - No, Hannah, you do not.
An invitation isn't inherently wrong or dangerous.<eos> Sexuality's very muddy.<eos> That's a real Grey area.<eos> Or at least we say it's a<eos> - Grey area so we can get...<eos> - I am so sick of Grey areas.<eos> When I was in fifth grade, I had this English teacher, Mr. Lasky.<eos> He liked me.<eos> He was impressed with me.<eos> I did, like, special creative writing.
That's a really good goal.<eos> - So, maybe one day, you'll be famous.<eos> - Pfft, maybe.<eos> And a lot of people know some stuff about you.<eos> Some stuff.<eos> I mean, they'll think they'll know everything, but they won't.<eos> - Like what happened to you.<eos> - Like what happened to me.<eos> You thought you knew everything, but you didn't.<eos> - No, I didn't.
You said one day you wanted to be a mother.<eos> We got a really special, specific thing going on, you and me, yeah?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> And you just decided to go and ruin it with some baby.<eos> I'm not gonna act like that's not what's going on, okay?<eos> It's fine if that's what you wanna do, but...<eos> Elijah, I understand that this might seem crazy, but you know what?<eos> I need you.<eos> I really do.
- It's my question, too.<eos> - That's my question.<eos> That's the question I ask other people.<eos> Well, it's also my question. I ask it to other people, too, because I think it's, like, the best way to kind of get down to the heart of people.<eos> - You know, like, see their true self.<eos> - Totally! Exactly!<eos> Their true, deepest, most intimate selves.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And of course we know the correct answer.<eos> - Yeah, we all do.
I'll be back in a few hours, and we'll spend some time together.<eos> I promise.<eos> Just don't get yourself in such a state, listening to this music.<eos> - And don't smoke.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I started in the theater department.<eos> I wanted to be a stage actor more than anything, but I never got cast, and my dad kept telling me that no one was going to cast me and I needed another job.<eos> He said that the last thing this world needs is another actor, and I was like, "Thanks, asshole."<eos> Parents don't always know.<eos> Mine didn't.
It was a while ago.<eos> I'm really glad you came out tonight.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll, uh... I'll be right back.<eos> Business meeting, huh?<eos> For the love of God, Mother, what are you doing here?<eos> I could just as easily ask you that question.<eos> Mother, I am not the one who's supposed to be dead.<eos> I mean, what if someone saw you in here?<eos> No one did.
- Of course.<eos> Have you ever thought you might like boys?<eos> I don't know. Even just a bit? That you're bisexual?<eos> What's this about?<eos> Some very cool people are bisexual, like Lady Gaga or Angelina Jolie.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> There are people who think that what we did on my birthday...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should know.<eos> And I do.
In cash?<eos> Oh, yes, Chief.<eos> That's the kind of money you just might kill for.<eos> JP, the planning document,<eos> I need to know who signed off on it.<eos> Of course it was.<eos> I take it you...<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> And I assume you want us to...<eos> Yes, I do.
Unlike him, you got help.<eos> Yeah. But you're in my corner.<eos> That's the difference.<eos> Aldo had no one.<eos> Hey.<eos> I just, uh, dropped off Jessica.<eos> And, let me guess, you thought you might check in to see what I'm getting from Tompkins' video doorbell.<eos> Looks like it's rough going.<eos> I thought those things actually worked.<eos> They do.
No.<eos> No, it wouldjust finish me off.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Isn't it going to do more damage this way?<eos> Damage?<eos> Suse, the damage is done.<eos> You saw the jury's faces.<eos> I'm going to prison.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
It's the high-level operation.<eos> No, this isn't your team, it's mine.<eos> No, you are not in charge.<eos> You were in charge. I am in charge now.<eos> If you have questions or concerns, I suggest you take those up with your boss, who can take them up with his boss, who can take them up with my boss.<eos> Guess who my boss is.<eos> I will give you a hint.<eos> His office is a big Oval.<eos> You want the hospital secured, ma'am?<eos> Yes, Agent Spaulding, I do.
He's covering his tracks.<eos> There's another.<eos> Two of them?<eos> Maybe more.<eos> How many hunters have you seen out here before?<eos> A lot.<eos> Still wanna split up?<eos> We can deal with it.<eos> We just need to find Brett's trail.<eos> No, we don't.
Are you?<eos> You've gotta be joking.<eos> I mean, this kid is out of control. - I'm gonna go talk to Hackett.<eos> - Emily, wait, before you do...<eos> No, why wait? The girl's a snake.<eos> She needs to be kicked off the team.<eos> I agree, but she is dangerous. Why?<eos> Because she snapped a pic of me taking care of a friend?<eos> Hackett knows what Alison and I have been through.<eos> Everyone in this town does.
- I have to go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, we'll figure this out.<eos> And, actually, I've to go meet Jillian to talk about a press schedule.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hey, are you sure you're okay?<eos> You're not still upset with me about...<eos> No, promise.<eos> He doesn't have anything on you, right?<eos> He does.
The other night, after you fell asleep. I... found it...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I was so angry when I wrote that.<eos> I know.<eos> And, and you should have been angry.<eos> The... the book I was writing about Alison where we met, andand I started...<eos> I started this relationship by lying to you.<eos> I wouldn't have blamed you if you had turned in that file then or now.<eos> I would have deserved it.<eos> - And maybe I still do.

I wouldn't have blamed you if you had turned in that file then or now.<eos> I would have deserved it.<eos> - And maybe I still do.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you do not.<eos> Okay?<eos> I was scared.<eos> And I've done some... really terrible things to you and everyone else.<eos> You don't need to tell me that.<eos> Yes, I do!

No, what's going to happen is going to happen.<eos> That doesn't sound like the Spencer I know.<eos> A little surprise.<eos> May I?<eos> Of course.<eos> The whole drive up, I thought about just staying on the road.<eos> Just following it someplace else.<eos> And why didn't you?<eos> You know what it's like to be the outsider.<eos> I do.
You went through my mail?<eos> We have what you want, you have what we want.<eos> Tell us the name of Alison's donor daddy.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then tell us who handed you the cash to make the transfer?<eos> Unless you'd rather tell the state board.<eos> Look, no...<eos> I-I don't have names.<eos> Alright.<eos> I never did.
You want to get it done right?<eos> Put it in the hands of a few.<eos> What we were doing was advancing this country's cause.<eos> How does freeing a man like Abu Ramal advance this country's cause?<eos> Well, it doesn't.<eos> The missions before, they were for the good of the country, but...<eos> No, this one wasn't about country.<eos> It was about you.<eos> Nobody wants to die to their old life, Sara.<eos> And Michael didn't.
Okay, we could just forget it ever happened.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> It was too late the moment I met him.<eos> He had my heart, and I had his.<eos> Then ask him... if that's what love is.<eos> It's not manipulation.<eos> Even if it means you have to let him go.<eos> You need to let him go.<eos> I don't need to ask him who he loves, Ali, because I know he loves me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Look around you.<eos> Skaikru did this to us.<eos> Because of them, Ontari, your rightful commander, is dead.<eos> This imposter stole her Flame.<eos> No.<eos> Wanheda saved us, all of us...<eos> Grounder and Skaikru.<eos> There would have been nothing to save us from if not for you.<eos> Azgeda has no authority here.<eos> We do now.
Yeah.<eos> Cheers, guys.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was us not too long ago.<eos> Total noobs.<eos> Yeah, Rip yarded us in.<eos> You remember his speech?<eos> I know you don't.<eos> You were too busy running your mouth.<eos> Of course I do.
Maybe there's still time to unring that bell.<eos> [door opens, closes] Why did you have to lie about everything?<eos> Audrey: Why do you think?<eos> He's one of us.<eos> I guess you're right.<eos> Well, I... I guess it's best if I just move on.<eos> Okay. I'm here.<eos> Your collateral, all of it.<eos> - Thought we had a deal.<eos> - We did.
Wonder why he kept it.<eos> You want me to take it to tammi's?<eos> I'm supposed to take care of my men.<eos> I'm supposed to be the goddamn good Shepherd.<eos> - It's not your fault.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - It's not your fault, Joe.<eos> - You don't know that!<eos> Buck wore this trident on his uniform.<eos> All seals do.
And you were right.<eos> It is about us.<eos> I don't want them to be a part of it.<eos> I really don't.<eos> But sometimes, there's collateral damage.<eos> Right, rip?<eos> Make me believe it.<eos> O0 c1 when you call up your witness, you want to swear them in first, like this.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Everything I've done, I've done for you.<eos> Out of respect and gratitude.<eos> And we are doing everything we dreamed.<eos> I'll try to talk to Boko Haram...<eos> Come up with some sort of accommodation.<eos> Joseph.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Tell me right now.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> No, I do.
Why?<eos> - You gonna tattle on us?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll walk.<eos> They charged Frank.<eos> And?<eos> They charged him as your co-conspirator.<eos> I thought that I could do this, Annalise.<eos> I really did.
Please open the door if you're in there.<eos> Laurel!<eos> I'm gonna kill you if you're alive in there!<eos> You're out of the hospital.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Better.<eos> You told me I could come and see you and talk to you when I was ready.<eos> No, I told you to talk to me when you finally wanted to come clean.<eos> So unless you're here to say you didn't actually see Frank in the basement that night...<eos> I did!
She needed me to leak that article.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes. What's your problem?<eos> You don't... think it's a little convenient that she came over at the exact same time that you're hacking her phone?<eos> No, I think you're being paranoid.<eos> And you're being naive.<eos> Okay, I'm being naive.<eos> And yet, here I am, going through her phone records because you wanted me to.<eos> By the way, you never told me that she called you over to the house that night.<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
Yeah, maybe 'cause he killed him.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Why are you just telling us this now?<eos> Because he was afraid of this, that you would think he did it, when the truth is he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Yeah, maybe that's what he wants us to believe.<eos> Will you stop attacking him, please?<eos> All of you have done terrible things, and you have asked me to believe that you did them for the right reasons.<eos> Well, now you need to do the same thing for Connor.<eos> - Yeah, he hated Wes.<eos> - No, I didn't.
I couldn't have gotten through any of this without you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I do.<eos> I love you.<eos> I...<eos> I think Laurel just called for me.<eos> You're gonna have to respond to him at some point.<eos> The only appropriate response to "I love you"<eos> is "I love you."<eos> Okay, but do you?
Beg that I might let you live once my armies came, if only as a slave.<eos> I've been a slave for the last seven years.<eos> I won't do it anymore!<eos> I will miss you when you're dead, but only for a minute.<eos> Then you will be forgotten by both time and the world.<eos> Well, she's my kid, too, Cindy.<eos> I have the weekends and...<eos> Well, no, I have the weekends and I don't want a Wednesday afternoon.<eos> Why would I want that?<eos> Yeah, nobody does.
I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.<eos> And if you agree... I think we can settle all this right now with a simple handshake.<eos> Would you all give us the room for a moment?<eos> Seventeen years.<eos> Eighteen in July, actually.<eos> All those years we built this place together.<eos> And all that time I've supported you... looked up to you, deferred to you.<eos> Because I always thought you had the best interests of the firm in mind.<eos> I have.<eos> You did.
I settle it right now, okay?<eos> You have to work together.<eos> It's what the boss wants.<eos> The boss can suck me.<eos> - I'd watch what I say if I were you.<eos> - Who you think you are?<eos> You should be kissing my ass right now.<eos> Me and my family.<eos> We built this whole business.<eos> We all did. Together.
Could go on a while, Julie said.<eos> Might turn into a bit of a party.<eos> So, shall I put your kids to sleep over here with mine tonight?<eos> Yeah, if you like.<eos> It's not a case of what I like, Karen, It's what you want. They're your kids.<eos> There's no need to get narky with her, Natalie.<eos> Julie don't get narky with me.<eos> What's Julie got to do with it?<eos> I thought you didn't mind looking after them?<eos> I don't!
We have loads.<eos> Candles play a really important part in Christian ritual.<eos> That's not why I wanted them.<eos> I gather you're not a believer.<eos> It's not like I don't have faith.<eos> In what?<eos> People.<eos> These people.<eos> And that Shannon will be found.<eos> But you don't do God?
I'd remember!<eos> If I'd sat on his knee, I'd remember, wouldn't I?<eos> You'd think so.<eos> And I wouldn't even sit on someone else's knee when I'm wi' Craig.<eos> Especially a bloke like Mick Donovan.<eos> So you do know him.<eos> You must have been surprised when you heard where Shannon had been found?<eos> Yeah, I were, dead surprised.<eos> Did you ever think to yourself that your Uncle Mick might have her?<eos> No, I didn't.
All right, Karen?<eos> Yeah, I'm all right, Julie.<eos> You're me friend, aren't you, Karen?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And your Natalie's friend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you said, friends don't lie to each other.<eos> Didn't you?<eos> Did I?<eos> Yeah, you did.
He gave us an A1 rating.<eos> Did you know we're the numberfour meat supplier in central Arizona?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Lots of places shut their doors on account of the drought.<eos> Most folks just don't realize how much water it takes to raise cattle, so...<eos> Cool story, bro.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You achieved nine erections while you were sleeping.<eos> Would you like to see the chart?<eos> - What do you...
I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just try.<eos> Try.<eos> In your apartment, you mentioned "her."<eos> Was that the woman in the accident?<eos> Oh, I can't sleep because I keep being dragged back to that place.<eos> Do you have any idea what that's like?<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
Terry, I never meant to hurt you in any way.<eos> I-I don't...<eos> What would you say to Miles if he were here?<eos> What would I...?<eos> I would ask him for his help.<eos> He knows what's been happening between me and Nora.<eos> What?<eos> She doesn't need to see that.<eos> She's my patient now, and, yes...<eos> Yes, she does.
Pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Tiller. Why, thank you, Jimmy.<eos> - All right, then.<eos> You drive safe. - Oh, I do.<eos> Is that the last one, or we got any stragglers coming through?<eos> Last one.<eos> Well, hey, thanks, Francesca.<eos> You were great today.<eos> You too.<eos> Those folks love you.<eos> Who doesn't?
Now I'm here because a long time ago, your brother and I were friends.<eos> You were never friends.<eos> You used him up.<eos> You fucked the bulk of his life before he had a chance to live it.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Well, I heard about what happened from some cops, who all said to pay that money, the 350 large.<eos> You're worth a lot of money, JP.<eos> You probably owe some of that to your brother for making sure you stayed on track.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- Shh. - Stay in school.<eos> I'm sorry about my friends, they're just...<eos> - Completely insane?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But what they say is true.<eos> Oh, okay, what...<eos> What that you guys are from the future, that you've somehow seen a bunch of movies that I haven't even made yet?<eos> Well, actually, I'm from the past, but that's beside the point.<eos> Look, George, I don't care about movies, but guys like them?<eos> They do.
BULLOCK: Hey, Jim.<eos> Where are we with Tetch?<eos> Barbara and Nygma gave the mayor's office a list of demands...<eos> friend snuck me a copy.<eos> They also threatened to kill Tetch if we tried to take him back by force.<eos> Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> We got no moves.<eos> GORDON: Yes, we do.
Good-bye, Oswald.<eos> I removed the bullets - when you were knocked out. - (bullets clink on ground)<eos> Right before I called them.<eos> In the backseat, the pin I used to unlock my cuffs?<eos> My tiepin.<eos> I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> (chuckles): It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
I'll be right back.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> At least you're not shopping at Villains "R" Us anymore.<eos> I'm sorry about H.R.<eos> I'm sure he would have appreciated you coming.<eos> Why did you come?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you wanted to come home.<eos> I don't have a home.<eos> Yes, you do, Caitlin.
Well, well, well.<eos> At least you're not shopping at Villains "R" Us anymore.<eos> I'm sorry about H.R.<eos> I'm sure he would have appreciated you coming.<eos> Why did you come?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you wanted to come home.<eos> I don't have a home.<eos> Yes, you do, Caitlin.<eos> You do.
I don't know, but I kind of like it.<eos> She had something in her hand.<eos> She had her phone in her hand.<eos> Well, it didn't look like her phone, so I told them to move.<eos> I had the situation under control.<eos> She told me that prometheus<eos> Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable intel on him.<eos> She's playing you, Oliver.<eos> I understand that you're suspicious of her, and I know this Laurel is from another earth, that this is not our Laurel, but we don't know why.<eos> We don't.
- I mean Slade Wilson and Malcolm Merlyn.<eos> - Thea-- - No. We are orphans because of those two.<eos> You know what I'm up against here.<eos> Yeah, so why are you sending Curtis and I away?<eos> Because I need the two of you to keep Felicity and Samantha safe.<eos> We need to get them off of the island.<eos> Ok.<eos> Curtis can handle it.<eos> I can understand if you don't want to go with Malcolm.<eos> Damn right I don't.
I slept with you because I thought it would save my job, and it was a mistake.<eos> Sure.<eos> Repressed emotions are something I'm very familiar with.<eos> I deal with it all the time on my show.<eos> - I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> - Please.<eos> You disgust me.<eos> It is just very interesting how we choose our words, and how we express those words in order to...<eos> I'm so looking forward to meeting your plus one, if she exists.<eos> Well, she does.
This is the first time you have to come home without him here.<eos> It's never gonna be as bad as this.<eos> That's actually not necessarily true.<eos> When my dad died, it actually got harder as time went on.<eos> I know you're trying to help.<eos> Do you remember when he used to lie on the floor and watch us have sex?<eos> - That, uh, creeped you out, as I recall.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. Yeah. It was another set of eyes watching me have sex.<eos> - He didn't know what he was seeing.<eos> - He absolutely did.
I don't know what to say.<eos> I'm not in your position.<eos> What if this were yours, how would you feel?<eos> Um, I think, I would... support your right to make your own decision.<eos> And how would you feel?<eos> I would feel bad, for you, for doing this.<eos> Then I would feel sad, too.<eos> I know I'm not... ready to be a father.<eos> Do you think that's how Jesus would feel if he knew?<eos> I do.
Damn, you ain't no Beyoncé.<eos> Yo, I don't remember us throwing that much shade when we were in G.U.<eos> They're not scared of me yet.<eos> How do you like being on the other side?<eos> I like the cooking... and kicking the girls' asses.<eos> I'm just grateful Rita gave me a job.<eos> - Well, look who's here.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - How we doing?
Guess who they're making interim principal.<eos> Thought you might be here.<eos> I can be pretty sporty, too.<eos> That's a good shot.<eos> Did... did you see me kiss Dawn?<eos> - Why didn't you say anything?<eos> - Because...<eos> When Aaron kissed me, it didn't mean anything.<eos> I was hoping that you felt the same way.<eos> Unless... did it?
Hey, so what do you guys think about, uh, giving Jesus my room?<eos> Like, permanently?<eos> Really?<eos> That's awfully nice of you, B.<eos> Well, not so nice.<eos> I was kind of hoping I could move into the... garage?<eos> Well, Callie and Mariana might have an opinion about that.<eos> Well, I'm sure Mariana will have an opinion, but... I'm fine with it, I don't want to sleep up there.<eos> I think that's a great idea.<eos> Oh, do you?
- Gabe's moving in.<eos> - Nothing has been decided yet.<eos> - What about me?<eos> - What about you?<eos> - I'm gonna move in the garage.<eos> - So Jesus can keep my room.<eos> - How generous.<eos> Hey, I'm the one who offered Jesus my room in the first place.<eos> Okay, well, what if I wanted to live out there, huh?<eos> Do you?
Mr. Edlund is clearly a disturbed individual, but I can't comment on his motivations at this time.<eos> What is your administration's position on the Star City gun registry?<eos> That we will be looking into it further.<eos> What's your administration's position on gun control?<eos> We're gonna examine all sides of that.<eos> What is your personal opinion?<eos> That it's complicated.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but 7 of your staffers are dead and others severely injured.<eos> Don't you think you owe them a response beyond "it's complicated"?<eos> I do.
It's not matter of "let."<eos> I have invitation to be here.<eos> Invitation?<eos> From whom?<eos> Oliver, have you brought Anatoly Knyazev to Star City?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> And he just told me that his operation was nearly compromised by my team.<eos> Well, I said, "that's impossible.<eos> The team no longer exists."<eos> The hell it doesn't!
I was not keeping count.<eos> Hmm. 11, I think, but not nearly enough.<eos> You ready?<eos> Because your operating theater is now lit, and of all the things that we need to do to get ourselves out of this hermetically sealed bunker, stitching up a wound from a fall that I totally predicted isn't one of them.<eos> I think that counts as 12.<eos> I--ok.<eos> I'm ready. Unh!<eos> - That hurt?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, it did.
- You've seen this before?<eos> - Read about it.<eos> Has to do with the fear of dying and getting stuck in the underworld.<eos> They believed that if you took a pure soul with you, you could trade your way into eternal afterlife or something.<eos> Ah, here it is.<eos> First documented by Egyptian Wesen under the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf II<eos> - in the sixth dynasty.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Does it say anything about how to stop it?<eos> Yes, actually, it does.
- Just a second.<eos> We have a warrant for the arrest of Nicholas Burkhardt and a warrant for the search of the premises.<eos> Okay, he's not here, man, and my wife is pregnant, so take your hands...<eos> Do not attempt to interfere.<eos> No Burkhardt. Clear!<eos> I think they're leaving.<eos> There are patterns on this cloth.<eos> Here?<eos> I don't see 'em.<eos> You don't?
We tracked the box itself, But... it was a dead end.<eos> So Valentine sent Duncan to steal a pair of baby booties?<eos> Someone did.<eos> Someone who wanted to circumvent us from tracking Jonathan.<eos> And now we have no leads on either of them.<eos> We've got nothing.<eos> Actually, we have less than nothing.<eos> There's something you should know.<eos> The Clave doesn't have the Soul Sword.<eos> They never did.
I can explain.<eos> You knew about the sword?<eos> I just found out.<eos> I swear.<eos> When?<eos> When did you know?<eos> Tonight?<eos> When I talked about trust.<eos> Did you know then?<eos> I did.
Excuse me.<eos> - I got some crackpot report...<eos> - Eros.<eos> The whole damn asteroid is moving under its own power.<eos> It's not exactly possible, yet that's what we've got.<eos> Moving to where?<eos> Unknown.<eos> But it's de-orbiting sunward.<eos> - Do we know why?<eos> - We do not.
She's welcome to him, his arthritis, his ingrowing toenails and his wandering eye.<eos> Sometimes men are just more trouble than they're worth.<eos> Seconded.<eos> Time I skedaddled.<eos> You can't dodge him forever.<eos> For heaven's sake, put the poor man out of his misery.<eos> Very well, I'll do the dirty deed.<eos> You've been avoiding me.<eos> I know why.<eos> You do?
Here? Really?<eos> Gosh.<eos> From Mama's wedding dress. Something borrowed, so you can have one Sayre with you.<eos> Tootsie.<eos> I love you, baby sister.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Dear friends, we've come together in this church on this day so that the Lord may strengthen and seal this union, so that Christ may bless this love.<eos> Do you have the ring?<eos> Francis Scott Fitzgerald, do you take Zelda Sayre for your lawful wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?<eos> I do.

Shut up.<eos> - She didn't ask, I offered.<eos> - Huh, lemme guess... She hasn't reached out since.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> - What?<eos> - Emily.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hey.<eos> Shocked you still come here.<eos> I-I don't really.
They directed me to an eBay page, and... she was selling all of it.<eos> Who does that?<eos> At first, I thought maybe she needed money, but then... as time went on, I began to think maybe she's planning to kill herself.<eos> What?<eos> Wh-why do you say that?<eos> Because when you wanna die, you give away all your things because you're not gonna need them.<eos> After all, look at me. She's already given me away.<eos> Claire... Trust me, your daughter is not suicidal.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
They took them somewhere else.<eos> Chris?<eos> They do this to her?<eos> At the crossing.<eos> We were ambushed.<eos> Did you see anyone at the border?<eos> Just the dead.<eos> I saw this place, I thought it was a refugee camp.<eos> You couldn't have known.<eos> We didn't.
Let's take a walk.<eos> Just out back.<eos> There's something i wanna show you.<eos> I don't know what you went through over there. You know?<eos> It's none of my business.<eos> I know you're dealing with it and you're processing it.<eos> I can't imagine how hard it is.<eos> But what I do know is that you did absolutely everything to make sure that you did the right thing.<eos> You had a job to do.<eos> You did it.
He's not going anywhere.<eos> On what grounds?<eos> My grounds.<eos> Look, you've made your point clear.<eos> Just give me a few more hours with him.<eos> He's gonna break.<eos> Ford, you're being awful quiet over there.<eos> Do we have enough to hold him any longer?<eos> No, sir.<eos> We don't.
Nobody thinks this is a good idea?<eos> Please don't do that. You can't do this to us.<eos> Catherine, let me just explain something to you, sweetie. All right?<eos> I really don't care what you think.<eos> I'm gonna run for president again.<eos> Okay? Mommy's gonna be president again.<eos> But you said that if any one of us objects that you're not gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't expect anybody to object, did I?<eos> This was a test, folks, and you all failed. You really did.<eos> - No, I just... - Yeah, woman, you really did.
I mean, like, jail.<eos> Do you believe in the afterlife?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, my mom did.<eos> She seemed pretty sure.<eos> She used to say, "All I know is there's more than I know."<eos> Yeah, I think that might sound wiser than it is.<eos> Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Come on.<eos> One drink.<eos> Well, that's a lie.<eos> Five, six drinks.<eos> Now isn't the time.<eos> Shadow.<eos> You must have questions, and if you don't, you should.<eos> What is that smell?<eos> What is it, cat piss and oven cleaner?<eos> Yeah, I do...
The police are dead.<eos> First piece of luck I've had in days.<eos> Hi.<eos> The police are dead?<eos> All of them?<eos> All of the police are dead?<eos> Worse things out tonight than you.<eos> Do you have a car?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> - Evening.<eos> - Evening.<eos> Betty's getting a spit polish.<eos> Stay as long as you like.<eos> You'll be safe here.<eos> No, we really should get goin'.<eos> Nonsense. Nonsense!<eos> You're gonna love it here.<eos> Everyone does.
I feel your every move, I know your every thought, I'm with you from birth, and I'll see you rot.<eos> What am I?<eos> What did you do, Ed?<eos> What did you...<eos> What happened to Penguin?<eos> Something happened, didn't it?<eos> Did you kill him?<eos> This is not gonna be good.<eos> This is not gonna be good.<eos> - You did, didn't you?
But your pain... it blocks you from who I need you to become.<eos> Who Gotham needs you to become.<eos> If one's feelings and emotions are strong enough, their consequences can follow you back into the real world.<eos> I don't know what you want from me.<eos> Over the centuries, we've tried to end the cycle of crime and violence that plagues Gotham, only for it to start up again.<eos> And do you know why it does?<eos> People are afraid.<eos> And fear breeds hopelessness.<eos> I'm supposed to believe you care about the people of Gotham?<eos> I do.
Ivy?<eos> Oh.<eos> Ta-da.<eos> My suit.<eos> So, Mr. Fries, will you join us?<eos> Where are we?<eos> Where we are is not important, James.<eos> What matters is why you're here.<eos> You know why I killed my uncle.<eos> Yes, I do.
Hey, Jim.<eos> Where are we with Tetch?<eos> Barbara and Nygma gave the mayor's office a list of demands...<eos> friend snuck me a copy.<eos> They also threatened to kill Tetch if we tried to take him back by force.<eos> Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> We got no moves.<eos> Yes, we do.

You realize trial by combat is to the death?<eos> Yeah.<eos> For the loser.<eos> Listen, you want him?<eos> You're gonna have to come and claim him.<eos> That's Arwen.<eos> That's... Arwen.<eos> I take it you also want the customary 24 hours to prepare?<eos> Do I want the customary...<eos> Yes, you do.
No, I mean, those two, they were geniuses.<eos> We depended on them.<eos> But with you, the roles are reversed.<eos> You depend on us.<eos> Harrison Wells was always there for me, so I guess in some weird way, I just... I want to be there for Harrison Wells.<eos> - Anyway...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So what are we doing here?<eos> I thought you didn't want Dad to know we're going after this arms dealer.<eos> Yeah, no, I don't.
Yeah, I actually went to that class.<eos> You better be going to all your classes.<eos> So if there is a universe where you stay in Flashpoint,<eos> Francisco here could vibe it.<eos> And you're sure you can do that?<eos> No, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> But Gypsy did say I could do some pretty incredible things<eos> - with my powers...<eos> - Yeah, she did.
I know that this is about more than just your dad.<eos> Look, I guess... I guess I thought... one day we'd figure out a way to be together.<eos> You know, but now that you have your powers, it's... it's like I never hear from you.<eos> Jesse, if... if you would, I want you to stay.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because of your dad?<eos> Because Barry is going to find him.<eos> Look, you don't know that, okay?<eos> You don't.
Reversal...<eos> Barry, it's time to pull a reverse Flash.<eos> Do it!<eos> He did it!<eos> He actually did it.<eos> He bloody well did it.<eos> I won't kill him! I won't!<eos> I know you all fear humans!<eos> You think we want war with Gorilla Kind!<eos> We don't!
But there's another way.<eos> It's not gonna come to that.<eos> Cisco, I'm gonna need your help.<eos> Tracked her down on Earth-2.<eos> Breach is taken care of.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Risky move coming to an Earth where interdimensional travel is punishable by death.<eos> Especially when I'm the one who's supposed to uphold that law.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> I don't do long-distance relationships.
No.<eos> Julian, we gotta end this, for everybody's sake.<eos> - I'll see you downstairs. - Oh...<eos> Okay, well, you guys can count me out, all right?<eos> 'Cause I didn't bring an endless supply of boxers to this planet.<eos> Julian, please.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> I can't believe that you would keep part of that Stone.<eos> Do you not remember what Savitar had me do with that?<eos> Yes, I do.
You mean like this clown just did?<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> Wallace...<eos> I understand what you've been through.<eos> Stuck in the Speed Force, things you saw...<eos> I get it. I also know that sometimes, the old adage is true.<eos> When you get bucked from the horse, best thing you can do... get right back on the damn thing and ride, Wallace.<eos> Ride!<eos> Hello, Barry Allen.<eos> - How do you...
Hands up, pal<eos> Do it now, or I'll shoot.<eos> Stop!<eos> How the hell did he do that?<eos> Maybe you can figure out how I did it, but... I doubt you'll have time.<eos> It's just beautiful.<eos> You know what, it matches the sparkle in your eyes.<eos> Aw, thank you.<eos> Barry, your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, he did.
What do you say?<eos> Yeah, I got a lot of coffee tastings and some book readings... lot of women left to charm, but I... I'm in.<eos> You know what?<eos> Free coffees for the gang at H.R. Jitters.<eos> Maybe 10% off.<eos> On me, let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.
I can... I can feel it.<eos> It's right there.<eos> It's right there, just brimming just below the surface.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yes, absolutely!<eos> Yes, it is, Tracy.<eos> And you can defeat Savitar.<eos> All you need is to just believe in yourself.<eos> And for what it's worth...<eos> I already do.
You will now.<eos> Just put 'em on.<eos> - You'll be okay.<eos> - Just don't get them wet.<eos> - Your Honor, I, uh...<eos> - What? Wh...<eos> I call Barry Allen to the stand.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do, yes.
It'll help me prime his neocortical and medial frontal lobes.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Oh, golly.<eos> Look at us.<eos> Just three musketeers working away.<eos> Just like old times, huh?<eos> Hey, Julian, did Caitlin ever tell you about our time working on the Particle Accelerator with Ronnie?<eos> No.<eos> No, she did not.
Your family.<eos> Caitlin, I can fix you.<eos> You already tried.<eos> Well then, I'll try harder.<eos> I don't care what it takes.<eos> I don't care what I have to do.<eos> I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.
It's my home.<eos> It's my...<eos> It's my family.<eos> Although, I... you know what, I will say...<eos> I have to tell you, I haven't always felt<eos> - I belong completely.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?
It's my...<eos> It's my family.<eos> Although, I... you know what, I will say...<eos> I have to tell you, I haven't always felt<eos> - I belong completely.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I did.

When you tucked me in when I was little.. When you dropped me off at school when I played baseball all those years.<eos> At my games alone thinking I didn't have a dad.<eos> You lied.<eos> You stole that part of my childhood from me and I'll never get it back.<eos> Honey, I can explain.<eos> I know you can't see it right now but Alan would have been a horrible father.<eos> And you're just gonna have to believe me on that.<eos> It's a decision I did not make lightly.<eos> No.<eos> No, but you, you did it anyway.
I-I just need time.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> But take it from me, if you hold on to hating him, it will eat at you.<eos> Why the hell does Cade want to meet here?<eos> Beats me.<eos> He doesn't wear the cape or carry the pitchfork, so maybe that's just his way of being dramatic.<eos> Things have a way of getting bloody with Cade.<eos> We may not have another chance, so... do you want to tell me why you were planning on leaving town?<eos> Nope.<eos> I don't.
When that bell rings 12 times, the the hellfire it unleashes, wipes out everything for miles.<eos> In this case...<eos> All of us in Mystic Falls.<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride, little brother.<eos> We're okay.<eos> Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.<eos> I think they're siphoning directly from you.<eos> But I don't have any magic.<eos> Of course you do, luv.
Well, normally, I would agree with you.<eos> But you insist on letting an impossibly attractive flight attendant come between us.<eos> And not in the fun way.<eos> Lucifer, we are very different people with very different personalities, and I'm not judging.<eos> I'm a homicide detective, not the slut police.<eos> And I mean you, not her.<eos> Nothing happened after you left.<eos> But what I'm saying is things have changed now, since we had our moment.<eos> We didn't have a moment.<eos> Yes we did.
Pardon?<eos> Brings me to your final gift... The throne of hell.<eos> You want me to be king?<eos> Well, with Lilith and Azazel dead, and Lucifer back in his box, we need a ruler.<eos> You are next in line, Ramiel.<eos> Prince of hell.<eos> It's just a name.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Still, the crown is yours if you want it.<eos> I don't.
Mary?<eos> A question.<eos> So?<eos> Thoughts on our little operation?<eos> And our team?<eos> Serena and Alton seem smart.<eos> Pierce...<eos> You know he calls himself.<eos> "The Hunter King of Baton Rouge"?<eos> I do.
You'll be happy to know the... The vessel is completely sound.<eos> The repairs are secure.<eos> And the security system?<eos> Whatever it is that lets crowley turn me into his own personal sock puppet.<eos> I don't hear words.<eos> The... the s-system is very much I-intact.<eos> But you can disarm it?<eos> I'm not really known for my Patience.<eos> I don't quite have the means...<eos> Who does?
- My brother said we can use his jet ski.<eos> - No.<eos> - We're not jet skiing.<eos> Jet skiing's for tools.<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> You think this dump has a restroom?<eos> Come on, find a bush.<eos> For the gas.<eos> - Want one?<eos> - Yes, I do.
No memory of where I'd been.<eos> No memory of how the hell I get in the goddamn desert.<eos> Then after a while, things started coming back.<eos> Little things.<eos> Lights.<eos> Sounds.<eos> Smells.<eos> Tastes.<eos> Sounds like you had a hell of a trip?<eos> Yeah, we did.

Yeah.<eos> Erm... So... we were all in here.<eos> Erm, people were coming in and out of that door there and the food was being done there.<eos> You knew everyone on the invite list?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> More or less.<eos> There were a few of Jim's business associates, you know, suppliers and stuff, who I'd maybe met just the once.<eos> Did you witness the fight between Jim and Ed Burnett?<eos> No. No, I didn't.
A drink?<eos> Do you want a drink?<eos> Er... White wine, dry. Like my men!<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, no, that's...<eos> I'm quite nervous. Are you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you for saying that.<eos> - Men don't normally say that.<eos> - Don't they?
Is that the first time you and Trish have slept together?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was just sex.<eos> Cos me and Cath...<eos> Erm we... we don't... er...<eos> Look...<eos> What I'm saying is, I didn't attack Trish.<eos> Why would I?<eos> If I wanted to have sex with her, I could.<eos> And I did.
_<eos> - Bloody hell.<eos> - What?<eos> Confirmation of the credit card used on that website to send the anonymous SMS message to Trish.<eos> It belonged to her husband, Ian.<eos> What?<eos> Her husband is sending her abusive anonymous messages?<eos> Yeah. Fancy going to have a chat with him?<eos> Now-ish?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Yeah, that was possibly me.<eos> Sarah, please say you didn't.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Sarah Elsey.<eos> I work here with Ian.<eos> I'm his girlfriend.<eos> And you're now admitting to sending this text to his wife?<eos> - Ex-wife.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Yes, I did.
It wouldn't have made any difference.<eos> What do you wanna do, Mark?<eos> Do you wanna use that knife?<eos> No.<eos> I can't live with what you've done to us, but I'm not strong enough to make you pay.<eos> It's pathetic, innit?<eos> What do I do now?<eos> So you not only stole back your phone, you kept what I deleted and you added even more.<eos> - Do you know how much that cost?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Stay here.<eos> - Dad!<eos> Police!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Enjoying yourself, boys?<eos> Get up!<eos> Stand up!<eos> Who of you shared the photos of my daughter around the school?<eos> - Dunno what you mean.<eos> - Oh, aye, you do.
You sold him as a slave.<eos> I see the faces of so many creatures.<eos> - I'm not here to open your belly, Jonis.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> I'll pay you.<eos> Here.<eos> You will not feed the slaves!<eos> And you will not bark like a great, fat hound!<eos> You said you will pay?<eos> Yes, I did.
How about this?<eos> Oh, my.<eos> You happy now, big man?<eos> You are.<eos> My manager noticed that you've been staring at the toaster ovens for, like, a really long...<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> Hey, do you know which one of these has a knob without any slack?<eos> No. Does it matter?<eos> [sighs] I thought so.<eos> I really did, but maybe it doesn't.
One hundred percent!<eos> Out of what?<eos> You two are the only ones who've ever gotten a perfect score.<eos> Us two?<eos> [Yuko] It is on.<eos> [Jacqueline] Here's how we handle DJ Fingablast.<eos> Men always want what they can't have.<eos> Cuban cigars, a watchable Superman movie.<eos> Just act like you don't want the gig.<eos> I don't.
- You're actually leaving?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I told you I was leaving.<eos> I gave my two-weeks' notice and I got another job. So, yeah, pretty much.<eos> How do I know that box isn't full of office supplies?<eos> Is this funny to you?<eos> No, it's not funny to me.<eos> I honestly, I don't understand how we got here.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> You don't.
My sister isn't old enough to get married, even if she wanted to.<eos> Tell me, bookworm... can you name me a language that was spoken by ancient Romans and is still spoken by very irritating people today?<eos> - Latin.<eos> - That's right.<eos> And can you translate the Latin phrase "in loco parentis"?<eos> "Acting in the role of parent."<eos> That's right.<eos> And that's me.<eos> You see, Violet can get married if she has the permission of her legal guardian.<eos> And she does.
Okay, if I win this hand, you give me a backrub, but if you win again, I'll put tape on my mouth.<eos> Please, Duchess.<eos> I am very handsome, but I am only one man.<eos> By the turrets of Gravelstein, this very handsome man shall be mine.<eos> By the Gardens of Worthington, if I can't have him, my heart will literally break.<eos> Figuratively. "My heart will figuratively break."<eos> Why, what handsome adventures I have had, only to end up at this same pond on this... my wedding day!<eos> Say your line.<eos> Do you... take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.
By the Gardens of Worthington, if I can't have him, my heart will literally break.<eos> Figuratively. "My heart will figuratively break."<eos> Why, what handsome adventures I have had, only to end up at this same pond on this... my wedding day!<eos> Say your line.<eos> Do you... take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.<eos> - Do you take this woman...<eos> - Man.<eos> Man.<eos> I do.
Let's see if he dies of natural causes.<eos> Explain yourself.<eos> The reason that I said I did not know anything about the snakes, is because I was being modest.<eos> You weren't being modest. You haven't been modest a day in your life.<eos> You were lying.<eos> Klaus, you can't speak to an adult that way.<eos> And he's lying now.<eos> He's a liar and a murderer and he killed Uncle Monty.<eos> You have no proof.<eos> Yes, we do.
Bryan, come take a field trip with me.<eos> What you surmised is true.<eos> One way or another, Axe will be in custody by day's end.<eos> - But we're not taking him. - Mnh-mnh.<eos> - Who is?<eos> - Eastern.<eos> Dake? Dake gets our trial?<eos> You had to have known we couldn't prosecute it. The conflict is too deep.<eos> You said you had a workaround.<eos> Yes, I do.
Tommy loved the sandworms.<eos> Christ, I thought he pawned this.<eos> It was my dad's.<eos> You find who did it, Detective?<eos> We did, yeah.<eos> You kill him?<eos> No.<eos> But somebody else did.<eos> You have my card if you need anything.<eos> Yes, I do.
I told you not to underestimate him.<eos> Did he make you?<eos> No, he didn't make me.<eos> Xavi, see what you can find out. If he made Woody, - I want to know.<eos> - He didn't make me, goddamnit.<eos> - Find out where his head's at.<eos> - You got it, Cap.<eos> No more fuck ups, Woodrow.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Doing great.
In your other life.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Leah Camille.<eos> They'll crucify me in court.<eos> Not if we bring it up first.<eos> Get it out of the way. Admit it and move on.<eos> And everyone will know I'm a whore.<eos> I understand why you didn't tell us.<eos> Please, you have no idea.<eos> Actually, I do.
What is it! ?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm just a guy.<eos> And I perform exorcisms.<eos> And you need one.<eos> Back off!<eos> And you need one.<eos> What does Will have to say about that?<eos> I don't have a father.<eos> Oh yes, you do.
Oh, my gosh.<eos> Should we call the vet?<eos> Yes, yeah. Um, wait, will you just call one?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened?<eos> Hey, I need to talk to you.<eos> What's going on with you and that girl?<eos> Her name's Savanah.<eos> Look, I know you like her, but do you know who she is, where she's been, what's in her past?<eos> Yes, I do, dad.
Why?<eos> Why, why, why?<eos> Don't.<eos> Stop.<eos> - You.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - This is...<eos> This is not my fault.<eos> - You took my tiger.<eos> - Yes, I did do that, but...
Next thing I know, I'm underwater.<eos> I kept thinking, "Aw, I'll sort this out."<eos> "I'll dig out from this.<eos> My daughters... when they look at me, when they look at my face, they'll forgive me."<eos> Me and another cop... a guy named Dan... we did whatever Manny said, and he said, "Do terrible things."<eos> Now it-- It's happening all over again.<eos> He's gonna talk about all that now, Manny is, and when he does... that prosecutor's gonna give me the death penalty.<eos> Assuming Dan doesn't kill me first.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't.
What does that mean?<eos> We just need to be careful is all.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> We can't be sure who's foe... or friend.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Do you remember how we met?<eos> How quickly you stole my sword from me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you scared me, Coltantha.<eos> You still do.
Awesome!<eos> It's regular shampoo, it just has medicine in it.<eos> Not... There's not a problem.<eos> Some people, they hear "prescription," they think...<eos> Hi, I'm Mallory.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, Coyote's told me so much about you.<eos> And your kids.<eos> He loves those kids.<eos> Yeah, I really do.
You can't do that.<eos> His face is all over the bloc.<eos> I know.<eos> But it's BB.<eos> Badge, please.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Show me your badge.<eos> Did you know that LA's Deputy Proxy was coming for a visit?<eos> No, I did not.
I know.<eos> But I still didn't think I'd go out like this.<eos> I just want a soldier's death.<eos> Please, Will.<eos> I know it's over.<eos> If Homeland catches up to me, I can't run.<eos> And I won't be able to hold out.<eos> I--<eos> You don't know what you're asking.<eos> Yeah, I do.
He was exposed to something.<eos> And then he wanted to go out like a soldier.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I was... working.<eos> Everything takes longer now.<eos> Can't just walk down the street anymore.<eos> Your whole cell almost fell apart today.<eos> You need to be there to protect them from themselves.<eos> I never asked for this. To have my face plastered all over the bloc like some kind of revolutionary.<eos> No, you didn't.
I can't go out there.<eos> Why didn't you just go back to your cell?<eos> I was the only one who escaped that raid.<eos> They'd never believe that I didn't talk.<eos> They'll kill me just to make sure.<eos> - Katie, we've got company.<eos> - Who?<eos> Redhats.<eos> - How long do I have?<eos> - You don't.
Well... that sounds like a fun place to start.<eos> Skin grafts.<eos> Skin grafts.<eos> We know they're putting foreskin in skin grafts.<eos> It was on "The Oprah Winfrey Show."<eos> And they're putting it into t-the face creams<eos> - you all use... the girls.<eos> - Hold up.<eos> They do not put foreskins in face creams.<eos> Yes, they do.
No, no, I doubt that.<eos> I do not play video games.<eos> Video games are for losers with nothing better to do.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Wolf? Hmm?<eos> If you don't like the games, why are you running the Interactive division?<eos> Well, let me ask you something, Connie.<eos> It's Kenny, sir.<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> Do you think that I like microwave ovens?<eos> No, I don't.
You're going to tell me everything he said, or I'm going to break you in two.<eos> Dawes is gone, sasa ke?<eos> And the science man, oso.<eos> Oye!<eos> Him one with us. What doing here?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Fodagut, bera, stay back.<eos> I trusted you, you little shit.<eos> I na need your trust, Earther<eos> No Belter do.
Like she'd noticed, actually noticed, all the extra chips.<eos> Do you know what I realised?<eos> She was fat.<eos> I'd fatted her.<eos> But that's life, isn't it?<eos> Beauty or chips. I like chips.<eos> So did she.<eos> So that's OK.<eos> And how does that in any way explain why you keep coming to my lectures?<eos> Yeah, it doesn't really, does it?
Certainly before I heard anything about Dr Laxman.<eos> What was the film that you saw?<eos> - You said you took in a matinee at the cinema.<eos> - Oh. It was five years ago now.<eos> Um... I think it was the one about the borstal boy who becomes a runner.<eos> Right.<eos> Thank you, Miss Berger, that's been most useful.<eos> - They seemed nice, didn't they?<eos> - Yes. I left some tongue in the fridge, did you see?<eos> Yes, I did.
Kelly's still asleep.<eos> Do you mind if I just put him in the back room?<eos> Sure.<eos> Let's find a cozy spot.<eos> So... okay.<eos> Um... you want to see some of the herbs and spices?<eos> - Uh-huh. - Hey, you like cinnamon?<eos> We got some cinnamon sticks right over here.<eos> You know where cinnamon comes from?<eos> - Do you?
Nick just said he wants you to make sure<eos> - Renard sees the 7:00 news.<eos> - Why?<eos> There's gonna be some kind of announcement.<eos> Okay, just go.<eos> Somebody's here. Who's here?<eos> Crap!<eos> It's Sean.<eos> - How do I get out of here?<eos> - You don't.
- all that for me.<eos> - But listen, Monroe, I am...<eos> I am... I am scared, I am, like, heart-racing, pit in my stomach, I can't breathe type of scared because now that<eos> And I can't...<eos> I will not live like this.<eos> I can't be this vulnerable all the time.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> You know that saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop"?<eos> I do.
I'm not really used to bringing life into the world.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> You want some thanks for being there when I couldn't be?<eos> Well, thank you, really.<eos> Thank you for being there.<eos> I really appreciate everything that you've done for Diana and me.<eos> It's too bad you didn't think of that before, you know, that betrayal thing.<eos> Now is this gonna be a regular treat with you?<eos> You're gonna keep showing up here and making me feel sorry?<eos> Because I don't do sorry very well.
Hair.<eos> Mm, wrong.<eos> Well, try glasses or a beard.<eos> Yeah, glasses.<eos> No!<eos> Beard.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I don't know this guy.<eos> - What?<eos> You don't?
Oh, my God.<eos> - I don't know this guy.<eos> - What?<eos> You don't?<eos> - After all this?<eos> - No, I mean, I don't know him personally.<eos> He's the guy from the park.<eos> Monroe, do you know him or not?<eos> Yes!<eos> We both do!
Like when my mommy went away.<eos> I thought your tummy might hurt because Nick's not your boyfriend anymore.<eos> Yeah, I guess my tummy might hurt sometimes.<eos> Do you want him back?<eos> Things are really different now.<eos> Sometimes I miss my other mommy too.<eos> Her name is Kelly, just like my brother's.<eos> You know her, don't you?<eos> I don't know where she is anymore.<eos> Do you?
Looks like Hampton was into some cutting-edge stem cell research.<eos> That morphogenic process Raju was talking about that deals with phenotypic plasticity traits is about the regeneration of tissue.<eos> It's in this article on the Meriwether University-based research team of Hampton, Raju, and two others, Dr. Victor Shelley and Dr. Julian Levy.<eos> There was no record of Hampton calling either of them last night.<eos> Okay, well, no luck on the security footage, but... I did get a hit on some fingerprints.<eos> And I think... no wait, I'm sure... you're gonna love this.<eos> And by love, you mean...<eos> Oh, to have an appreciation of or for the two sets of prints found at the crime scene, both, and I repeat for emphasis, both in the system.<eos> So we have two positive identities with criminal records at the crime scene?<eos> Oh, yes, we do: a Robert Johansson and a Martin Dominguez.
Yeah, so I broke the mirror.<eos> Then I went to clean it all up, and all the pieces started coming back together.<eos> And then... it grabbed me.<eos> It came through the mirror?<eos> I think I woged.<eos> I did, and then I bit its arm.<eos> I don't really remember any more.<eos> Nick, I don't want to stay here.<eos> I have this feeling that... something is starting.<eos> I do, too.
Monroe and I made an agreement that if one of us is suffering from dementia, the other will contact the Gevatter Tod.<eos> - You serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's a commitment we made to each other.<eos> It's how Wesen have stayed in secret for so long.<eos> I know it sounds callous, but it's how our community works.<eos> And you know this Gevatter Tod?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know how to make contact?<eos> Yeah, we do.
There's nothing more I can do.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> Hey. Where's Eve?<eos> No.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Nick's here.<eos> Oh, God, I'm glad you're back.<eos> It's just awful about Hank and Wu.<eos> - They didn't deserve that.<eos> - None of them did.
I've waited a long time for this. But in some ways it's been no time at all.<eos> Prepare yourself Time Ryder.<eos> It looks like time is about to ride you!<eos> Hey, asshole.<eos> Oh!<eos> Okay, first of all, I knew I wasn't the stinky one.<eos> And second of all, who or what the hell was that?<eos> Remember when I told you I come from a future that's great?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, I did.
I wonder what it's doing here.<eos> I don't know, but as Crono Teens, it's our duty to pass it off to the right authorities.<eos> Are you kid...<eos> Of course it is.<eos> We should give it back to Time Base One. It'll be safe there.<eos> I mean, what if it got into the wrong hands?<eos> It already is in the wrong hands.<eos> Don't you wanna see Time Base One?<eos> It's one of the seven wonders of the galaxy, and to set this right?<eos> No! I don't.
We must be running short on time, Doctor.<eos> What was it like to kill that man? - Codename: Payday?<eos> - I didn't kill him. I provided intelligence.<eos> Your intelligence led to his death.<eos> And three others. Possibly innocent civilians.<eos> People die every day, people died while I was saying that sentence.<eos> Gene Cosgrove, lung cancer.<eos> - Does that bother you?<eos> - That doesn't bother me, Jane.<eos> - Then what does?
I know I'm a little early.<eos> But I came to bring you... a graduation present.<eos> This is a job offer.<eos> Not just any job offer.<eos> An associate, at Rand Kaldor Zane.<eos> I already have a job when I graduate.<eos> Rachel, we talked about this.<eos> When you graduate, you're gonna have to stand before the bar and pass the character and fitness test.<eos> And you think working at your firm looks better than looking at mine.<eos> Yes, I do.
And since then, he's paid his dues.<eos> And what about you?<eos> What about me?<eos> Do you think the committee would have me break up with the man that I love just because he went to prison?<eos> What does that say about character and fitness?<eos> You make a good point.<eos> And if I were you,<eos> I'd be prepared with some others, 'cause I'd say one day soon, you're gonna have to make your case.<eos> And do you think I have a better chance of making my case if I work for my father instead of at Pearson Specter Litt?<eos> Yes, I do.
Harvey, please!<eos> Jessica didn't even want your name up on the wall, so if you think I'm gonna let you be managing partner while she's still breathing, you're out of your goddamn mind!<eos> Harvey!<eos> That's enough.<eos> I have the start paperwork for those associates in case you want to look it over.<eos> I'll just leave it here.<eos> I was gonna tell him, you know.<eos> I was gonna tell him that he's the one that should be managing partner.<eos> Louis, you may have your flaws, but he had no right to talk to you like that.<eos> Yes, he did.
I was gonna tell him that he's the one that should be managing partner.<eos> Louis, you may have your flaws, but he had no right to talk to you like that.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> I did everything he said I did, and the reason I did it is because all I ever care about is for people to see me as more than I am.<eos> - Louis...<eos> - The funny thing is, all I ended up with was the shortest, most humiliating run as managing partner in the history of the world.<eos> If you ask me, you may have had a short run, but you made your mark.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, unless I'm mistaken, we have ten associates starting tomorrow who chose to come here over one of the best law firms in the city.<eos> They did that because of you.
One of the students told his parents that you were in prison.<eos> I tried to explain the situation to them, but...<eos> I'm sorry, Mike.<eos> They're all leaving, Donna... First Jessica and now Mike.<eos> They're family.<eos> You always talk like we're your only family.<eos> You need to go make things right with your mother.<eos> Mike, what are you doing here?<eos> I thought school started at 7:00.<eos> It does.
I made you an 8:00 reservation to Boston, which means you should be halfway there by now.<eos> I missed my flight.<eos> Harvey, you never miss your flight.<eos> And the last time you said you did, you were lying to me then, too.<eos> - Donna...<eos> - Please tell me you didn't change your mind about seeing her.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Then what's the problem?<eos> I haven't seen the woman in seven years.<eos> The last time I did...
I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - You're back.<eos> - I am.<eos> And I heard you took care of my client.<eos> Thanks, Louis.<eos> You're welcome, but we're partners, and they're all our clients.<eos> They are.<eos> Louis, I didn't mean it when I said you weren't ready to be managing partner.<eos> Yes, you did.
I do, but I'd be shocked if you knew what it was.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> No, Harvey, the point is,<eos> I'm not doing anything to him, I'm doing it for him.<eos> And how exactly do you figure that?<eos> I figure that, because Benjamin updates everybody else's computers remotely, and once a quarter he's down here, pretending not to like my act, so unless you want me to focus my rapier-like wit on you,<eos> I suggest you walk your pretty little self back into your office.<eos> Benjamin.<eos> I knew it.<eos> No, you didn't.
Mike, I know why you think this is the right choice, but I can do this.<eos> I'm sorry, Oliver, but at this point in your career, I don't think you can.<eos> - Mike.<eos> - Oliver... You said it yourself...<eos> You get flustered in court.<eos> I know that, but if I'm going to be a real lawyer, I have to get better in trial, and the only way to do that is to get back on the horse.<eos> And I'm telling you that when the right case comes along,<eos> I promise I will let you do that, but this is not the case.<eos> This one's Marissa's, and I need to know you have her back.<eos> I do.
Now, are we gonna do this thing or not?<eos> It happened at my first mock trial.<eos> I was so prepared.<eos> And then trial started, and the other side threw a wrinkle in.<eos> And I thought I could think on my feet, but all of a sudden, I felt everyone watching me, and my mouth went dry, and my mind went blank, and I froze.<eos> Oliver... we can get through this together.<eos> Except now you told me I can't handle it, and that's gonna be boring a hole in my brain, making this thing a thousand times harder.<eos> Well, I can't take back what I said, but what I can do is stay here all night to make sure you prove me wrong.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
What are you talking about?<eos> You didn't even want him to be here in the first place.<eos> Well, I want him here now.<eos> Louis, I thought you were a more forgiving person than this.<eos> And I thought you wanted our baby to have a relationship with its biological father.<eos> And he's going to.<eos> But if you're gonna get this worked up about something like this, it makes me think I don't really know you.<eos> Louis, can you honestly tell me that you really know me?<eos> Are we ready to take a picture?<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, I woke up the next morning, I went straight to the bank, I withdrew my life savings, and I was gonna start<eos> - that charity.<eos> - Good for you!<eos> And then I immediately fell into subway tracks and was electrocuted by the third rail.<eos> - Ooh... - Honestly, not the type of rail I thought was gonna kill me...<eos> 'Cause I love cocaine.<eos> Do you have any?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I shouldn't...<eos> Do you?
Do you promise that the testimony you shall give in the case before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Some swelling to the parietal lobe, which is to be expected, but, uh, This... this is a bit of a surprise.<eos> What's that?<eos> A mass...<eos> Roughly the size of a small grape.<eos> I have a grape in my brain?<eos> But you see these edges?<eos> Clearly defined, which usually means it's benign.<eos> Usually.<eos> Many, many people live their whole lives with grapes in their brains, and never even know it.<eos> But now I do.
Your chances will be one in 20.<eos> Pick a number.<eos> Nine.<eos> So you have a second cycle.<eos> This is the ultimate casino.<eos> The drive to reproduce is manic, it can become a vortex.<eos> I had one patient who was desperate to risk her life just to carry a baby.<eos> Did she succeed?<eos> Three.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Oh, what else?<eos> An enthusiast, which is a good balance with Julia.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm positive. - Mm-hm.<eos> OK, um... Ah, what's your birthday, Alexander?<eos> We'll do yours and Mary's.<eos> Oh, where I come from, you don't tell anybody your year. Mummy?<eos> You want to have a peek?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
He's got a bit of a delicate question,<eos> - in preparation for Thursday.<eos> - What?<eos> Did I have an intimate relationship with my superintendent?<eos> Well, actually, that's about right.<eos> Hello, Robin.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> He's really insistent on this point.<eos> So, before I answer back in proceedings, I just need to know...<eos> No, I didn't.
What--what did you do?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I get a little bit enthusiastic sometimes.<eos> I'll be gentle.<eos> You've been in bed all day.<eos> I came to check on you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm f-f-fine.<eos> Uh, are you sure you still want--<eos> Uh, I-I do.
I think he meant well.<eos> He probably didn't know how hard it would be to clean out.<eos> And now magic is failing on Earth... because of shit, proving once again that comedy and tragedy can coexist in the same goddamn sentence.<eos> Honestly... I am in over my head.<eos> I am not even in control of which world my body is awake in, and my sexually aggressive wife, she could wake me up at any moment in Fillory.<eos> Eliot, there are certain student/teacher boundaries which I'd prefer not to cross.<eos> So what am I supposed to do, Henry?<eos> What did you think was going to happen when you dove headfirst into another world?<eos> I thought I'd die.<eos> But you didn't.
What'd he say?<eos> - What'd who say?<eos> - The guy you called.<eos> Who did I call?<eos> The guy from the Young Comedians Special.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No, I gotta call him.<eos> - So you didn't call him?<eos> - No, I called him.<eos> No, you didn't.
No, no!<eos> - Please don't... No!<eos> No, I am not kidding you, Courtney.<eos> I will let you go as a client.<eos> - I didn't wanna have to say that. - Oh, my God.<eos> Do not put your foot in the pool, or the career is done.<eos> And I'm not... I'm not messing with you.<eos> - Oh, God. - I don't care what you're saying.<eos> Okay, you did it! You did it!<eos> You did the foot.
Why don't you sit down, Sandy?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What would you like to drink?<eos> You know, I got a bit of a sour stomach.<eos> If you got Dr. Brown's black cherry diet, that would be perfect.<eos> Or a big glass of whiskey.<eos> Either way is...<eos> Oh, look.<eos> Did you ever see that naughty little movie, 9½ Weeks?<eos> No, I didn't.
You look gloomy.<eos> Reiser's killing out there. Come on.<eos> You're like a monkey with a coconut. You're just looking at it...<eos> He's killing the jokes that I wrote.<eos> It should be me up there killing it.<eos> Next year, it will be.<eos> CBS sees your jokes work now.<eos> Next year, you'll be telling those jokes, 'cause you wrote 'em.<eos> You want me to do the jokes he's telling right now on next year's Grammys?<eos> But you do 'em in your voice.
These all sound like songs Joni Mitchell jerks off to.<eos> It's not me.<eos> - I'm cool.<eos> - You're hip.<eos> You're fab, you're totally gear.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know, man, why don't you just call it Sophia's Joint.<eos> Change it when you think of something better.<eos> We all know what happened to Skeleton Key when they re-launched Miss Theo Goes Vintage.<eos> We do?
- Something like dance. - Something like dance?<eos> - Sophia, come here.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> - You're so big, harder...<eos> - And it's filled with porn.<eos> I've seen worse.<eos> So, does that help? - ...<eos> I feel so nasty. - No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
- What do you mean?<eos> - He's a great kid.<eos> And he's gonna be a great lawyer.<eos> But I had to watch him tank a case without being able to help him and a woman ended up out on the street.<eos> I thought if we do this, then I'll never to have to sit back and do nothing when someone I care about is losing ever again.<eos> Then stop worrying about what we're doing because tomorrow isn't about losing.<eos> It's about winning.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> We've been up all night and we've got nothing.<eos> - Yes, we do.
What are you doing with that stool?<eos> Holding it.<eos> What are you doing with that beer?<eos> Drinking it.<eos> Till the end of the world, right?<eos> Till the end of the world.<eos> Asshole. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Talking to you.<eos> I don't have all day.<eos> No, you don't.
It's a protection charm.<eos> I made it for Adam when he was born.<eos> I keep it in his room.<eos> He sleeps with it sometimes.<eos> I thought that maybe, if you have this...<eos> Every little bit helps.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey... I got to go.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm comin' with you.<eos> Hey, Yusef...<eos> if you don't mind me asking, what was the deal with that skirt?<eos> With Lela?<eos> Muslims believe that modesty, that um... hiding the skin and the shape of the body is important.<eos> It protects women from unwanted sexual advances.<eos> Right.<eos> - Everyone is so angry.<eos> - I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> My name is Jimmy Sanguinetti.<eos> I'm here to see Erin Lindsay.<eos> Regarding?<eos> I'm her father.<eos> Does she know this?<eos> She does.
I'm not.<eos> Yeah, I told some friends.<eos> Who?<eos> No way.<eos> And have you bring them here and spin them around like me?<eos> No way.<eos> You may need to.<eos> Or what?<eos> Don't you believe me?<eos> I do.
However, the King will take my word...<eos> For now,<eos> You continue to seduce him with your wit and wiles but the day will come when he sees you for who you really are:<eos> an empty husk of vanity and and manipulation.<eos> Ariadne sent me.<eos> The answer is yes.<eos> I didn't ask a question.<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> I wanted to meet you.<eos> No, you didn't.
This must be the new fridge.<eos> You like this?<eos> Look, it has a screen so you can see all the food that's inside. Mm-hmm.<eos> Kind of like that one?<eos> This one has an app, so you can actually watch the food on your phone.<eos> All it needs to do is keep my fucking beer cold.<eos> Hmm. You're running low on beer.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Did you forget to scan that bar code?<eos> Yes, I did... on purpose.
Stu is saying that since all eight companies have now licensed the patent, he has a stronger case against us, so, um, he'd actually like m-more money.<eos> How much?<eos> Three hundred thousand dollars.<eos> So, we just ate the Wheat Thin, didn't we?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see any Wheat Thins.<eos> Shall I add them to your shopping list?<eos> Eh, sure.<eos> Well, let's hope that Melcher doesn't hear about all this.<eos> You guys don't need all these lights on, do you?<eos> Yes, we do.
The Darkhold fixed that.<eos> It showed me regret and desire...<eos> - so many astonishing things.<eos> - It made you dangerous.<eos> I only wanted to help you.<eos> Roll credits.<eos> Sorry, Aida.<eos> Take him out!<eos> - Did you know he could...<eos> - I did not.
You?<eos> You don't talk much about your childhood, do you?<eos> The foster homes, bouncing around.<eos> I imagine a lot of the time, it felt like you had to perform to convince people to like you.<eos> Only the places I wanted to stay.<eos> Why are you asking?<eos> Because if you enter every room thinking you got to do a song and dance, eventually everything becomes a performance.<eos> And believe me, I know how it feels putting on an act full-time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do, don't you?
Whereas I still have my mind but know exactly what I am.<eos> And more importantly, I understand a basic truth that you don't realize yet.<eos> And what's that?<eos> That our bodies don't matter.<eos> Radcliffe built a world ... a world exactly like this one.<eos> Every molecular detail the same, just... with a little less hurt for each of us.<eos> What do you mean, "hurt"?<eos> Imagine if your greatest regret could be wiped away.<eos> Do you know what that would be?<eos> I do.
So, I re-ran your test results.<eos> Guess who turned out to be a potential Inhuman.<eos> Go on.<eos> Guess.<eos> Ah, well.<eos> No matter.<eos> We've got plenty of ways of making you talk.<eos> No, Fitz.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why?<eos> So you can blow his brains out?<eos> I could never hurt him.<eos> I only want to talk.<eos> Now make the call.<eos> Yes, Father?<eos> Listen to me very carefully, son.<eos> You know I've always loved you.<eos> Only ever wanted what was best for you.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Yep.<eos> An entire empire starved, sickened... and beaten.<eos> Consigned to dust.<eos> You have your time, it passes.<eos> Something new gets built.<eos> Yeah, well, there was a time, I thought I'd live forever.<eos> Lately, I been wondering what's gonna happen after I'm gone.<eos> This isn't about your family.<eos> You want to be remembered.<eos> Of course I do.
She's lying.<eos> Let's find out.<eos> I can only imagine how painful it is.<eos> Nobody's seen Sidney for days.<eos> - How do I find him?<eos> - Sidney has help.<eos> Somebody's working with him.<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know his name.<eos> Nobody does.
I want to be with you.<eos> I know, Firefly.<eos> You're just gonna have to stick it out a little longer here, till things are safer back home.<eos> It's not safe here, either.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Hey, Amber, what do you mean by that?<eos> Aunt Megan, she had a monster inside of her.<eos> We took care of that, didn't we?<eos> You saw it leave.<eos> We both did.
He was working for us.<eos> Paul's job was to target fellow officers, to secure evidence that might convict anyone passing information to organised crime figures -- individuals, gangs, whatever.<eos> He was investigating Kevin Sherwood?<eos> Sherwood was a target Paul was making decent headway on before his death -- you've met him,<eos> - so you know what kind of person he is.<eos> - A prick.<eos> Correct, and not only that, he's a prick we suspect has made payments to a number of officers in various units.<eos> What about Frank Linnell?<eos> He's not someone we have an active interest in.<eos> Plenty of our colleagues do, of course.
I know the bullets were fired before the crash, and I know that you're involved.<eos> He threatened to hurt my family.<eos> - Argh! - What's going on here?<eos> Who?<eos> He just showed me where -- he told me to hit the bus stop.<eos> And you didn't ask why?<eos> Of course I asked.<eos> He said he needed... he needed to cause a distraction, that night, in that area.<eos> I didn't know anyone was going to be killed.<eos> I didn't.
Yeah, well, that's not going to happen to you.<eos> You know Linda from Marketing?<eos> yeah.<eos> She actually carried to term but her son only lived a few days.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
Nothing changes instantaneously.<eos> In a gradually heating bathtub you'd be boiled to death before you knew it.<eos> Stop. Jeez.<eos> You want to kill me.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Good for... Look.<eos> It's not good for me.<eos> Red wine is good for me.<eos> Odette told me if you get any fatter, she's gonna kick you out.<eos> - She did not.
I have a conference call in five minutes.<eos> They arrested three more Marthas in the West End.<eos> They were planning some kind of attack.<eos> Don't these people ever give up?<eos> I forget, how many tiles do you pick to start?<eos> Seven.<eos> - Do you want to play?<eos> - Love to. But I have work to do.<eos> - And, in any case, you know the law.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- I need to talk to Louis. Whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait until tomorrow, because if you don't get over there before that money changes hands, you are opening us up to a shitload of trouble.<eos> Kind of creepy in here at night, isn't it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I find it kind of peaceful.<eos> Then why get rid of it?<eos> And more importantly, why'd you need the sale to go through so quickly?<eos> I told you, I have another opportunity.<eos> And what if I said the real reason was you knew you vodka business was about to be sued for using another brand's recipe?<eos> I would say I did not know that.<eos> - Well, now you do.
Then what we should be doing is finding a way to get her kicked off.<eos> Harvey's working on it.<eos> But in the meantime, I need to know the ins and outs of this committee, because while she's on it, she's gonna use every dirty trick in the book to end this thing before it gets started.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go hole myself up in the library and start preparing answers to every dirty question I can think of.<eos> Louis, are you okay?<eos> I'm fine, Donna. What can I do for you?<eos> I know you know Benjamin and I have been working on a business.<eos> But I'm not sure that you know that we brought on Stu as an investor.<eos> - I didn't, Donna;
You were offered a deal to get out early, and you took it.<eos> I protected an innocent man...<eos> What you did was insinuate yourself into your roommate's life, gain his trust, and pretend to be his friend.<eos> True or false?<eos> You're taking it out of context.<eos> The context is you portrayed yourself as one thing when, really, you were another, which is what you did the entire time you pretended to be an attorney and what I believe you are doing to this body right now.<eos> Mr. Chairmen, if she's going to impugn his character while he's speaking, then he's entitled to let someone else speak for him.<eos> This isn't a trial.<eos> We don't allow character witnesses here.<eos> Actually, you do.
So you can say no if you want to, but don't say I haven't changed.<eos> Because the Mike you met that night in prison never would have told you the truth just now.<eos> Julius, please.<eos> I need this.<eos> This is the address.<eos> It's tomorrow at 9:00.<eos> I don't have anyone else.<eos> Mike, hey.<eos> Harvey, tell me you got some good news.<eos> I do.
But what I'm not gonna do is let her strip you of everything that you are.<eos> Harvey, he's right.<eos> Let it go.<eos> Whatever it is, Donna...<eos> Harvey, I know you're in a rough place right now, but whatever's gonna happen with Mike is gonna happen.<eos> You've done everything you can.<eos> And I'm tired of putting my wants on hold.<eos> What is it?<eos> You know about my product with Benjamin.<eos> I do.
Whatever's going on in there, Seidel's gonna fight like hell.<eos> It's not gonna make a difference.<eos> She's never gonna change her mind.<eos> - I think she will.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I mean that story wasn't any old story, and that woman wasn't really a woman.<eos> It was a man named Joseph O'Neal.<eos> And it was Walter Samson's godson.<eos> - So she did call in a favor.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
- In the bullpen.<eos> What is it now, Harvey?<eos> You want to put the janitor in charge of bankruptcy?<eos> Or the guard downstairs could be head of litigation.<eos> - Are you finished?<eos> - Depends on what you say next.<eos> I'm sorry I said those things about you, and I want you to know I didn't mean any of them.<eos> I'm sorry too, Harvey.<eos> Jessica, you don't need to apologize.<eos> Yes, I do.
Across to where?<eos> Look, there's nothing on the other side.<eos> There is!<eos> There has to be!<eos> We just can't see it yet.<eos> You!<eos> You can reveal it to us.<eos> You were meant to show us the way.<eos> - I don't know how.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Women were abandoning their families and we needed to make a change.<eos> We were running out of time.<eos> You were arrested for inciting to riot, if I recall?<eos> I had a temper in those days.<eos> Back then, did you ever imagine a society like this?<eos> A society that has reduced its carbon emissions by 78% in three years?<eos> A society in which women can no longer read your book.<eos> Or anything else.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Dark ops, middle of the Baltic Sea, average life expectancy once you get there is like two months.<eos> I'm not giving up on him.<eos> Then you're gonna need me.<eos> They won't transfer him right away.<eos> Any safe house they store him in...<eos> - I have clearance to get us inside.<eos> - And I have a team.<eos> Look, Eliza,<eos> - if you care about Dolls...<eos> - I do.
- Maybe this is my chance.<eos> - No.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> The spirits are getting stronger.<eos> There's an object that's calling to 'em.<eos> There.<eos> - Those were hers.<eos> - Man, what the fuck?<eos> - How you know that?<eos> - Just do.
I don't know.<eos> Oh, see, the thing is, we need one of those, like, just-edging-outta-cool, needs-to-pay-the-mortgage types who can say useful things, but with a tinge of sadness.<eos> I'm the tell-it-like-it-is judge.<eos> But I thought I was tell-it-like-it-is and you were gonna be, like, comforting and supportive.<eos> Are you fucking serious right now?<eos> Yeah, I guess that's a stretch.<eos> I can be supportive when I have to be.<eos> Yeah, the thing is, we were thinking that you could be the stage manager.<eos> Of course.<eos> The dyke does tech.
Yeah, no, everything's great.<eos> Mary is great. No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'mI'm fine.<eos> I justyou know, really.<eos> Yeah, I miss you too.<eos> You know, I got to go in a minute.<eos> I just, um, I, I wanted to let you know that we're having a baby.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and I don't know
What happened to the kids in that picture?<eos> Picture?<eos> From the, um, the exhibit?<eos> Well, it was in a war, and they were very scared.<eos> Did they die?<eos> It was a very long time ago, Johnny.<eos> Can that happen here? No.<eos> But if it did, what would you do?<eos> It's not gonna happen here.<eos> But if it did.
Does your father believe that?<eos> Yeah, he understands.<eos> You know, complicated problems call for complicated solutions.<eos> Killing people's not complicated.<eos> It's simple.<eos> Do you see?<eos> You understand this world.<eos> You understand me.<eos> That's why I picked you.<eos> But I didn't...
If he's in bed with the Martians...<eos> He holds all the cards here.<eos> Make him a peace offering.<eos> I'll grovel, even if it's from a prison cell.<eos> He won't speak to you, Sadavir.<eos> Chrisjen, this may be our only chance to stay in the game.<eos> They're already making weapons.<eos> - They're testing them...<eos> - You honestly believe that Mars would use this protomolecule to destroy Earth?<eos> Yes, I do.
MCRN is securing a landing corridor for an inbound burner.<eos> Those scientists were packin' up the lab to leave with that thing.<eos> I'm guessin' that was their ride.<eos> They're not gonna be too happy when they find out their lab rat is loose.<eos> Even more reason to kill it now.<eos> I guess you got your wish.<eos> Mars is in the protomolecule business now, just like everyone else.<eos> You know we don't know that for sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
Trying to trick me, huh?<eos> Like that sebakawala who flies this ship?<eos> Calm these people down and line them up.<eos> Children first, best you can.<eos> Do it and I'll trade places with you.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I was on the last ship off Eros<eos> I didn't do enough.<eos> I had a brother on Eros.<eos> We all did.
I'm sorry.<eos> Do you have any children, Meg?<eos> Let's just close our eyes and get back to sleep, okay, Ralph?<eos> - But I can't sleep.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> It's way past your bedtime and your dad's gonna be home any minute.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Why do you keep saying that?<eos> So, you don't have kids?<eos> No, I don't.
Yes.<eos> You know, I don't know if it was part of your plan or a happy accident, but Axelrod has decimated the part of the state where I poll weakest.<eos> He's shown you his neck.<eos> He has.<eos> And you get to become the defender of the people.<eos> And... you'll get the governor's mansion for your efforts.<eos> And Connerty's started.<eos> You got one of those Cheroots?<eos> Fundadores.<eos> Yes, I do.
I am convinced he is sending secret messages to the rebels through that unreadable tabloid.<eos> Lieutenant Colonel John Graves Simcoe.<eos> I'm the commander of his Majesty's Queen's Rangers. I see that.<eos> No militia.<eos> Provincial forces, not militia.<eos> Sorry, sir, only commissioned officers or sponsored guests.<eos> The barman knows me, I rescued his life last Thanksgiving. Hello, friend.<eos> Good Quaker fellow.<eos> You know this man, Mr. Townsend?<eos> Yes, Tommy, I do.
I want to enlist, sir.<eos> Fight like a soldier like I should have from the beginning.<eos> Colonel Hampton will see to your enlistment.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> What was Brewster doing in Connecticut?<eos> Likely selling goods on the London trade.<eos> It's good cover for his trips across the sand on Culper business.<eos> How did Arnold know?<eos> Well, he doesn't, sir.

All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> We should talk.<eos> Um, should we?<eos> I may disappoint.<eos> - Listen, Vernon is...<eos> - Wha...<eos> Headaches still?<eos> Migraines. You get 'em?<eos> Unh-unh. Father did.
Jake wasn't the only one.<eos> It was one of my family members.<eos> You killed him.<eos> You hate me.<eos> Good.<eos> Maybe you can understand the anger I have towards the Ottos.<eos> Magnify that hate a thousand times, and maybe you can understand.<eos> I do hate you.<eos> I hate you for killing Travis, for thinking you know how I feel.<eos> You don't.
Ma'am?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Oh!<eos> - Greg Morehouse is here for our meeting.<eos> - He's your editor.<eos> - I know that.<eos> Hey, Greg!<eos> Can we get you some coffee or some tea or...?<eos> - Do you have some bai hao white tip?<eos> - I do!
If it makes you feel any better, if I was in your shoes, I probably would've tried to steal the presidency, too.<eos> Well, that's what made the two of us such a beatable combination.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Selina, I beg you, please don't do this.<eos> - I have a new life, I have a new wife.<eos> And we are expecting our first child.<eos> - Congratulations. - Thank you.<eos> She would be dialing a divorce lawyer if she ever thought that you and I had swapped more than, you know, appreciative memos.<eos> - You understand that?<eos> - I do.
How many towels are you...<eos> Breaking news from the "Washington Post."<eos> Buried among many new scandalous acts - from the Meyer Presidency... - Oh, no.<eos> - Jaffar! - Sources close to...<eos> - What is the matter? What's going on?<eos> - No, no, look! They know!<eos> They finally know it's me!<eos> - Oh, my gosh!<eos> Well, the history books are being rewritten, and this time, it's not Texas saying Satan made fossils.<eos> Yes, he did. - What?
You never touched it.<eos> Thanks, Inspector, but I must respect the skipper.<eos> You'd be welcome to church any time.<eos> I mean joining... joining.<eos> - Would I have to be baptised?<eos> - You mean you'd like to convert?<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, but we should go.<eos> I have essays to write.<eos> - Converting would suggest that I already follow a religion.<eos> - You do.
It's a lie.<eos> - You're liars.<eos> - I know you're upset.<eos> Zafar believed it.<eos> He wanted to be like you.<eos> I wanted to be like you.<eos> But I couldn't.<eos> I don't drink, I don't curse, I don't play your stupid games.<eos> - You don't have to fit in.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Amanda, this is going to be hard enough as it is.<eos> We can't do this any more.<eos> I'm still leaving him, it just can't be for you.<eos> It's... it's too difficult.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You know?<eos> How it looks.<eos> What it means.<eos> - It shouldn't matter, but...<eos> - But it... does.
Don't try and stop me.<eos> I'll Mountain Dew it.<eos> You know I'm crazy when I'm all Coked up.<eos> So I heard a lot of noise coming from your room last night.<eos> And since I know that bat is dead, because it had a heart attack on my pillow,<eos> I assume you had a gentleman caller?<eos> He wasn't a gentleman, but he did wear a monocle while we did it.<eos> Well, you had a much more exciting night than I did.<eos> Both of my legs fell asleep on the toilet.<eos> Then so did I.
I lost him the minute I lost her.<eos> How do people get through the loss?<eos> How are you getting over Benedict?<eos> Did you know that the trails that airplanes leave in the sky contain biohazardous toxic waste from hospitals?<eos> So many horrible things in the world.<eos> Just awful.<eos> Bad people, bad, bad people hurting the very thing that gives us life.<eos> And now Mother Nature has had enough.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes, you do.
And now Mother Nature has had enough.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> You're blinded by society, but deep down, you know.<eos> You know, and it's not your fault.<eos> You just need to open your eyes.<eos> Tell me how to open them.<eos> Feel your purpose.<eos> - I don't know what my purpose is.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I know what you called her. She told me.<eos> She wouldn't leave you.<eos> I wasn't gonna let her be a victim. Yeah.<eos> You're messed up, all right, and that's why she finally went out there.<eos> That's why she was so scared that night.<eos> She loved me!<eos> No one could love you, not the real you!<eos> Alex loves me.<eos> Until she finds someone that could fuck her!<eos> I did!
Yeah, for sure more than me, 'cause it's pretty overcast.<eos> Yeah, it is a little shitty looking, admittedly.<eos> The only thing that would make it better... no clouds and a little hickey on my neck, but oh well.<eos> Hey.<eos> You want me to give you a hickey, don't you?<eos> No, I don't, but thank you for offering.<eos> You're a sweet man.<eos> He wants me to give him a hickey.<eos> - He doesn't.<eos> - I don't.
I think it's like this.<eos> Now...<eos> And then I think I'm gonna spin around, and we're gonna put your arm around my neck.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then here, like this, and then just sort of in like this.<eos> Melanie, do the moves.<eos> Those are my moves, kid.<eos> I mean, they're the moves that got me cast in the porn dance party in Body Double.<eos> Please, as if you worked with De Palma.<eos> I did.
Tangerine trees, marmalade skies, the whole shebang.<eos> You want another taste?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wanna be a zombie?<eos> - What?<eos> - A zombie. It's rad, I swear.<eos> If this is being a zombie, then bring it on!<eos> This is torture and I'm not even enjoying it.<eos> Tell me again how we know the peeping Tom had a criminal record?<eos> We don't.
No.<eos> No, Carlota.<eos> No. No, please. Carlota, no.<eos> Operator 47.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Yes, hello. [clears throat] Forty-seven?<eos> Is this Marga?<eos> No, I'm not Marga.<eos> But you just said you were Operator 47.<eos> I did?
No, of course not.<eos> I mean, I wish him dead, but I would not harm him.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> I will not outstay my welcome.<eos> Thank you for your kindness.<eos> You are sworn to Alfred.<eos> To become King of Mercia you would need to break that oath.<eos> If that is my fate.<eos> Then you believe he speaks the truth?<eos> No, I do not.
It is a death.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> Lords!<eos> It is Uhtred.<eos> Uhtred Ragnarson!<eos> The future King of Mercia!<eos> Welcome to Lunden, your new home, should you want it.<eos> Sigefrid.<eos> I thought you might want to kill me still.<eos> Oh, for a long time, I did.
Out.<eos> All of you, out.<eos> You have the palest of skin.<eos> Unblemished.<eos> My touch offends you?<eos> No, it was a surprise, lord, nothing more than that.<eos> Lord, love should be gentle and kind.<eos> "Gentle and kind," she says.<eos> How is it that you have a knowledge of how love should be?<eos> I do not.
Why don't you give that to Monroe?<eos> Now, you may be a golden boy to the suits upstairs, but to me you're still just a beat reporter here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, don't close the...<eos> London.<eos> Hey.<eos> Want an autographed copy of my new book?<eos> Not one bit. - Ooh.<eos> Jealousy doesn't look good on you, my friend.<eos> Then again, nothing does.
That's why I went to California.<eos> I just had to prove this whole thing wrong.<eos> But I couldn't.<eos> The evidence for your faith... it's more overwhelming than I could've ever imagined.<eos> But it wasn't just the evidence, okay?<eos> It was you.<eos> You never stopped loving me.<eos> You never gave up on me.<eos> And I think, because of that,<eos> God didn't, either.
And once they realize you're gone?<eos> They'll never suspect you.<eos> You're loyal.<eos> They trust you.<eos> Look, I just can't do it, Miranda.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I knew you'd do this.<eos> I just knew you'd pull the rug out right from under me when I finally gave in and slept with you.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> Oh, but it did.
Thanks.<eos> Just so we're clear, if she gives you anything, you share it with me.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> My name is Mike Ritter, Secret Service.<eos> I'm assigned to the president's personal protection detail.<eos> Yesterday you were brought to the president's attention by Speaker Hookstraten.<eos> She said you claimed to have had information about Vice President MacLeish before he was confirmed.<eos> The president would like to know what that information was.<eos> Agent Wells, you need to answer my question.<eos> No, I don't.
Well, now you will have that same option.<eos> So, let me guess... you've been to Bowman's office.<eos> He'll never make it to the White House.<eos> We'll see.<eos> I should've gone public with you 12 years ago, Liam, fed you to the wolves.<eos> Too late now.<eos> Not really.<eos> I still have the evidence against you, Liam.<eos> And now...<eos> Senator Bowman does, too.
- Just relax!<eos> Everyone, just relax.<eos> It's not a weapon.<eos> It's a human heart.<eos> This is the man who tortured me at the black site.<eos> Enhanced interrogation.<eos> He knows.<eos> Kurt and I go way back, don't we, buddy?<eos> I thought you said you didn't know anything...<eos> I didn't, Jane.
You have one, single paralyzing memory of being stuck in that orphanage, and walking out of here isn't going to help.<eos> Let me help you, Roman.<eos> Or stay stuck here in this room, and in your mind.<eos> What happens when Roman finds out that I lied to him?<eos> That I was the one that wiped his memory?<eos> He'll never trust me again.<eos> I'd say getting your memory wiped was the best thing that ever happened to you.<eos> Think about who you were and who you are now.<eos> You got a chance to start over.<eos> And now, Roman does.
Can't act like you're trying to get a sit-down, 'cause it'll cause red flags.<eos> Right now you're just there to introduce "Remi"<eos> and check Kat's temperature for business.<eos> Yeah, and if Kat's into it, she'll bring it to Abel, - and we'll use him to draw Shepherd out.<eos> - How?<eos> A sting operation masquerading as a weapons sale.<eos> None of that is happening today.<eos> Today is about establishing a contact and trust.<eos> Okay, um, so I don't need a gun or anything?<eos> No, you do not.
Yeah, sure. What's up?<eos> If the trap happens with Sandstorm today...<eos> I'd like to be there.<eos> Why don't you ask Weller?<eos> Because he'll say no.<eos> Is this about Borden?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, I just...<eos> I do understand what you're going through.<eos> You do?
Because he'll say no.<eos> Is this about Borden?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, I just...<eos> I do understand what you're going through.<eos> You do?<eos> You know what it's like to find out that the person you've been sleeping with is a terrorist?<eos> To have someone plan these dates and give you these amazing, useless gifts, and then kill a bunch of your co-workers and your friends?<eos> To be so blinded by all of your feelings you just, you miss all the signs?<eos> I do, actually.
Darling, I know.<eos> It's beastly.<eos> Everything's excruciating!<eos> Well, at least you're at home now so I can look after you.<eos> If my testicles start swelling, you know what that means, don't you?<eos> ! - Yes, I do.
- Stop talking about that area!<eos> It's a good excuse to keep Aunt Hermione away from the house.<eos> Isn't that a bit mean?<eos> She's coming all the way from England.<eos> - Yeah, to wag her finger at us.<eos> - It's not mean, there's nowhere for her to stay now that Donald's here.<eos> I did notice that.<eos> Five minutes after I move out and you've get a new son and I'm relegated to the guest couch.<eos> - I have the mumps now.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Mother, I'm not gonna sit here<eos> - and listen to you.<eos> - What?<eos> You don't have to, because you know it already.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I'm gonna leave.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, it's okay.<eos> Because I do.
No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> - It's okay.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, you're lying to me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We have three babies.<eos> We have a boy and a girl.<eos> We do.
It's the second best thing that ever happened to me.<eos> The best thing that ever happened to me... was you telling me that you'd marry me.<eos> I'm still in love with you.<eos> And I will be at our restaurant bright and early tomorrow, I'll be sitting in our booth, waiting for you.<eos> Oh, my God, this is endless.<eos> I kind of wish she didn't make the final round so we could get out of here.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> It looks like we have a checkmate, everybody.<eos> Congratulations, Tess.<eos> Yes, we do.

- We won't even worry about that yet.<eos> - Come on, we can have the reception in the Lazy River.<eos> - What?<eos> - People floating around with drinks.<eos> - Toby. - Huh?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, you've said three whole words since we left the show.<eos> Are you gonna tell me what the problem is?<eos> - I don't have a problem, Rebecca.<eos> - Yes, you do, Jack.
I had to go take care of her.<eos> Oh, come on, you think I don't know that, cuz?<eos> I know that.<eos> I'm sorry. Cuz?<eos> Like cousin?<eos> This is your cousin?<eos> Yes.<eos> My son, Randall.<eos> Yeah, he look like you.<eos> I do?
Wow. Wow.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> That is something. Uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Admit to me that you hated the fact that I had something happening for myself.<eos> - I hated that you lied...<eos> - No. ...about working with your ex-boyfriend.<eos> No, that's total BS, Jack.<eos> You hated the fact that I was singing again.<eos> I was fine with it. You didn't want me to have a career.<eos> - You never did.
Can I ask you a personal question?<eos> Uh, I don't know what the signals are like in your culture, but in mine, when we spend an evening helping someone take apart vibrators to smuggle into a foreign country, it's a pretty good indicator that it's okay to get personal.<eos> What's your sexual orientation?<eos> Out and proud hetero.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It wasn't a come-on.<eos> Oh, it would be okay if it was.<eos> I could do worse, and, you know, honestly,<eos> I actually really get the whole girl thing.<eos> I do.
Just take a deep breath.<eos> Try to be calm.<eos> Just try to relax, David.<eos> The gas, now.<eos> Use the gas.<eos> Use the gas!<eos> David, my boy.<eos> My beautiful boy.<eos> Mommy loves you.<eos> She does.
You must be curious, though, right?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This is so good.<eos> Right?<eos> Pork is amazing.<eos> It's just like chicken but juicier.<eos> Thanks for convincing me not to fast today.<eos> All right, so be honest. How religious are you?<eos> You really go to prayer and stuff?<eos> I do the Friday prayer here and there.
Wait, aren't y'all two grown-ass men?<eos> Yeah! But we're scared of our parents.<eos> Okay, this is crazy.<eos> Now, I got some religious relatives that's not into the whole lesbian thing, but I ain't got to hide who I am.<eos> Not that eating pork is on the same level of scrutiny as being gay, but you know what I'm saying.<eos> Yeah. Are you religious at all?<eos> We've been friends since we was kids.<eos> You know I go to church sometimes.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You do do that.
Right.<eos> Is there any clues as to what Tim was doing getting Hana to come to his flat?<eos> No. We're running background checks on Hana, but she still appears to be an innocent party.<eos> Her explanation holds up as to why she was the last person contacted by Tim.<eos> Either Tim sent the text himself, or, if he was dead already, the killer did.<eos> Well, that fits with the phone being stolen by the killer.<eos> Tim had a hi-tech security system installed in his flat, and the cameras fed direct to his computer.<eos> There's no images stored anywhere else.<eos> It's another reason we need to find his phone and computer.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
So we have this vehicle crossing this junction and then coming back a few hours later.<eos> Now, the reason we're interested in this particular junction is because it serves an address just a few hundred yards away where, on the night in question, a member of the police forensic staff was murdered.<eos> Timothy Ifield.<eos> I... I've got nothing to do with any murder.<eos> We also have a witness saying a vehicle matching this description and a driver matching your description was seen outside the address where the murder took place.<eos> Are you seriously suggesting that Nick is a suspect?<eos> No.<eos> One step at a time.<eos> I'd just like to know if Mr Huntley saw anything on the night in question that might help us with our inquiries?<eos> No, I didn't.
You're running a fever.<eos> I think I should sign you off on sick leave, until the specialist sees you.<eos> There's no way I can take time off work, I'm sorry.<eos> I just can't.<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> The high street youth club, with a tenner between them.<eos> Nando's.<eos> On a school night?<eos> You don't want to talk to me, Roz?<eos> Of course I do.
It's me.<eos> I've been calling.<eos> Why?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The vampires... They're on the attack.<eos> - Y'all need to come with me.<eos> - You again.<eos> I don't want you coming around here.<eos> Dad, you need to listen to him.<eos> No, I don't.
As a precaution against potentially disloyal elements within our own ranks.<eos> The safest action was to secure. As much intelligence as I could first, Then to bring it straight to berlin.<eos> Tell us how exactly you convinced. The camp x spies to trust you.<eos> Why did you need to communicate with him in secret?<eos> To establish a personal level of trust between us.<eos> So, making secret plans with the enemy is more important. Than your own people knowing what's going on?<eos> I suppose so when you're sending agents to their death.<eos> It had to be done, neil, And I know that is hard for you to understand.<eos> They didn't have a chance.<eos> No, they didn't.
Heidi saw you in a compromising situation.<eos> And I took care of it.<eos> That never should have happened.<eos> We had to clean up your mess!<eos> She was about to tell schmidt.<eos> Everything could have fallen apart because the two of you.<eos> Weren't careful!<eos> But it didn't.<eos> I know what I'm doing, alfred.<eos> Do you?
I hear you.<eos> You don't want to make things worse for william.<eos> Don't touch him!<eos> We won't.<eos> If you cooperate.<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> I am giving you a chance to protect him.<eos> Surrender and he will not be harmed.<eos> I have your word?<eos> You do.
Let's take the rest of the day off.<eos> - Have some drinks.<eos> - Drinks?<eos> I...<eos> Yeah, let's not... Let's have a welcome party.<eos> You know?<eos> We're all new.<eos> Let's get to know each other.<eos> Who wants to go to Malibu?<eos> - I do!
And you took this job because no one else would hire you.<eos> Who are you now, Robert Evans?<eos> You haven't done this before.<eos> - You haven't done anything.<eos> - GLOW is my idea!<eos> So what?<eos> Ideas are cheap.<eos> Everyone's got ideas.<eos> Your idiot butler probably has ten Oscar-winning ideas.<eos> - I do.
Come on.<eos> 'Cause I really don't see you up anybody else's asshole.<eos> Other people don't piss me off as much.<eos> And Sam put me in charge.<eos> I'm official now.<eos> So, deal with it, Rosen.<eos> Fuckin' anti-Semite.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When did we learn that move?<eos> We didn't.
I'm so sorry, I, uh...<eos> Well, had a little bit of an emergency.<eos> Well, everything's fine, but...<eos> I'm just gonna grab my keys, and...<eos> Oh... no smoking.<eos> Keith thinks I quit.<eos> Well, it's my first pack since Randy was born, so...<eos> did Steel Horse live up to the name?<eos> - They told you.<eos> - Melrose did.
Specifically, the, uh...<eos> The colorful language and the KKK.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You didn't like that one, Glen?<eos> Well, uh...<eos> Ah! - Yeah.<eos> - I'll tell you what I did love:<eos> The two black girls.<eos> We want more of them.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
I'm gonna charm old people.<eos> Are you gonna be okay?<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> All right.<eos> Come back, play more Brubeck, then get the fuck out of here.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Got any blow?<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
And, yes, I was gonna use them on him before, but I was wrong.<eos> And you think he'll make the right choices now?<eos> No.<eos> But I hope he still may.<eos> I know you don't believe that's what I want, Belle, but it's true.<eos> When Baelfire rejected my magic, I respected it.<eos> I just wasn't brave enough to follow it.<eos> My whole dark life, I've sought out those who are light... like you.<eos> So, what, you don't want him to kill Emma?<eos> No, I don't.
Hi.<eos> Hi, Kristen. I'm Dr. Robbins.<eos> How are you feeling today?<eos> The baby's really hungry.<eos> Could I have something to eat?<eos> You had your pregnancy snack an hour ago.<eos> No seconds.<eos> You know that.<eos> I'll need written proof of that.<eos> Of course you do.
They gave her a crib and diapers and everything... all in her cell.<eos> And her mom just dropped the baby off every morning, like daycare.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> What?<eos> It's... just a movie.<eos> Yeah, obviously, I know that.<eos> Do you think I'm stupid?<eos> Nobody thinks you're stupid.<eos> Oh, s does!
I'm here for the baby.<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> The mother is never gonna bring the baby to visit?<eos> Can she even do that?<eos> If she's legally adopting her after the baby's born and she signs the papers, she can do whatever she wants.<eos> I hate people.<eos> Okay, so, do we tell Kristen?<eos> 'Cause it'll kill her.<eos> - We have to.<eos> - No. We do not.
He withdrew.<eos> Henry.<eos> He did not have the will to fight me.<eos> He could not bring himself to take up arms against God's own annointed king.<eos> What, and so he ran?<eos> Well, then he is not a York.<eos> No York man would ever run from battle.<eos> No one will believe his claim again.<eos> I never thought that we would have this.<eos> But we do.
He's a beat poet.<eos> I'm you.<eos> I'm me.<eos> I'm everything you wanna be.<eos> He got the bullet out.<eos> Stopped the bleeding.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> 'Cause... well, yesterday we did some digging into your past... what's real, and I think we may know...<eos> I know what I am.<eos> You do?
Are you... did we come here for a reason?<eos> The old house.<eos> Don't you have a... they made it sound like you were part of a team with, like, a-a headquarters.<eos> They'll be here soon.<eos> I thought we could... Talk first.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> What do you wanna talk about?<eos> I wanna know your secret.<eos> - What do you...
Rose!<eos> Fever broke.<eos> Jesus, Rosie!<eos> Honey, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> I just had to pee from all the Gatorade you had me drinking.<eos> - That's all.<eos> - Let me look at you.<eos> I'm okay, Byron.<eos> I told you everything was gonna be fine!<eos> - Yes, you did.
Keep on fighting as long as we can.<eos> No matter what comes next, I want you to know, I'll always appreciate everything you've done for me.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> Hey.<eos> Evening, garçon.<eos> What's on the menu tonight?<eos> This... this is truly undignified.<eos> Do you want to eat or not?<eos> Well, I do, yeah.
There's something bigger going on here. - Shh.<eos> - Quiet.<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> I guess it's been a long day.<eos> Would you like to go to sleep?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Your shoes are still on.<eos> Klaus?<eos> I promised our parents I'd always look out for Klaus.<eos> But I didn't.
- Mr. Ramse, I'm...<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You don't get to apologize, lady.<eos> You got your kid back, right?<eos> I lost mine.<eos> Twice.<eos> I bury my boy every day.<eos> And I'm tired.<eos> I'm not afraid of dying, because I know I got it coming to me.<eos> I do.
Where the hell are you?<eos> Hospital dispatch.<eos> Hey, we're getting slammed down here in the ER.<eos> Could you send down Dr. Cassandra Railly, please?<eos> All right, I'll page her now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dr. Cassandra Railly to the ER.<eos> Dr. Railly to the ER.<eos> I thought you didn't want to see me.<eos> I don't.
"The House of Cedar and Pine."<eos> 1957. Us.<eos> That's how Olivia knew.<eos> Everything is on that document.<eos> - If anyone else sees it...<eos> - They won't.<eos> Whatever it says about us, we'll destroy that part.<eos> Jones will never know.<eos> We just need to get to the painting first.<eos> And if we don't?
Never give up on family.<eos> You fight. Win or lose.<eos> It's what mothers do.<eos> Jones, I need you to send me to 1953.<eos> I...<eos> Dr. Railly, enough.<eos> I think it's time we had a talk.<eos> Mother to mother.<eos> - Jones, you don't understand. - Correction, Dr. Railly, I didn't understand.<eos> But I do now.
Pedro hasn't paid his taxes in 10 years now, and the penalties have added up substantially.<eos> In fact, it's probably time for a sheriff's sale.<eos> Hell.<eos> I'm sure glad you're not my neighbor.<eos> How much is in there?<eos> $5,000.<eos> Pedro García has always paid his taxes on time.<eos> We know that.<eos> He'll have records and receipts, but I guess you know that, too.<eos> We do, sir.
We'd seriously thought we lost you this time.<eos> It's good to be home.<eos> I'll tell you guys everything, just let me jump in the shower and then we can celebrate.<eos> Actually, this can't wait.<eos> Someone stole all the remaining doses of the cure from my office.<eos> - Someone stole...<eos> - Well, let's not dwell on that.<eos> I gave you a syringe a few weeks back.<eos> It's the last one, and we need it for Liv. Do you have it with you?<eos> I... I did. Um...
Everything okay?<eos> Bram's been leaving the bunker.<eos> What?<eos> He met a girl in the camps.<eos> Fell in love.<eos> She was killed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He felt obliged to tell the girl's mother.<eos> Does he know how dangerous...<eos> He does.
Wound up being in too deep to come up for air for the two weeks leading up to Rick's release.<eos> When I finally got back, Anna and Wally were gone.<eos> They'd moved out.<eos> And that's the last you ever heard of them?<eos> I got a letter from Anna some time later, saying that she was living with her brother and starting a new life.<eos> She didn't want to stay in touch.<eos> The ex-husband was out for five days before he got busted for assaulting his po.<eos> He's been locked up ever since, so he didn't kill them.<eos> I know.<eos> We done here?
And I presume she's not going to be there.<eos> But all the top brass are.<eos> We may not get a chance like this again.<eos> We were thinking that we could mingle, listen.<eos> Plant some false intel.<eos> Schmidt's gonna be there?<eos> That's right.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Does helene bauer know how to dance?<eos> Of course she does.
My life in exchange for new intelligence.<eos> Our superiors wanted sinclair. Interrogated and executed as a morale victory.<eos> They'd want the same for you.<eos> Why kill a man. When he can become an asset?<eos> Intelligence speeds the war, saves lives.<eos> We don't disagree. "We"?<eos> The brigadefuhrer and i.<eos> Who has your loyalty?<eos> Faber or your superiors?<eos> He does.
You won't get any parades.<eos> Hello, mags.<eos> The official secrets act means.<eos> You don't talk. Ever.<eos> Your family will never know what you did.<eos> But everything you do. Will affect this fight.<eos> The people you see, The people you don't.<eos> The people you save...<eos> Ania?<eos> The people you don't.
You have nothing to worry about.<eos> I'm being questioned in connection to a Justice Department investigation into whether my girlfriend committed espionage.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> So I'm either a traitor or a moron.<eos> A moron.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Ah, you always know just what to say.<eos> Aram, you're a trusting person who assumes the best in people.<eos> Be yourself and they will see that.<eos> Everyone does.
Farook Al-Thani.<eos> Agent Mojtabi, walk us through this again.<eos> Tell us exactly how you met Elise Nickerson.<eos> Okay, I was at the gym, and she had been waiting for a friend and asked to borrow my phone.<eos> Uh, she said hers was lost.<eos> And then, you know, one thing led to another and...<eos> And the next thing you knew, she was using your personal laptop to access classified data.<eos> Well, when you put it like that--<eos> You expect us to believe you knew nothing about this?<eos> Yes, because I didn't.
Don't be sorry.<eos> Be happy.<eos> You obstructed our investigation, put lives at risk, lied to us.<eos> - Yes, to protect my country.<eos> - Your country?<eos> While you're on this task force, the country you're protecting is the United States.<eos> - And today, I protected both.<eos> - Almost died in the process.<eos> You need to think about where your allegiance lies.<eos> - No, I don't.
If not, I won't.<eos> He's right.<eos> You should, uh, get some rest.<eos> - Dinner can wait.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Totally.<eos> Thank you for the rain check.<eos> Actually, uh... I don't, uh, want a rain check.<eos> I mean... I do.<eos> Obviously, I do, but... I don't.
Yeah, it was worse than terrifying.<eos> It was... embarrassing.<eos> There I was on the record, testifying to what horrible taste I have in women, my, uh, habit of falling for people who aren't what they appear to be, what I make them out to be.<eos> What happened with Elise was kind of soul crushing.<eos> To find out that the person that you love... ♪ say we were abducted... ♪ ...the person that you can see yourself marrying and having a family with and-- and growing old with, to find out that...<eos> Is a spy.<eos> Someone whose allegiances you can't trust.<eos> I can't be with a person like that.<eos> I thought Panabaker told Cooper you'd never be reinstated.<eos> She did, why?
"Okay, don't eat it yet.<eos> All right, now eat it.<eos> Start consuming it.<eos> All right, stop.<eos> Slow down. Stop. Stop.<eos> Spit it out! Spit it out!<eos> I told you to stop!<eos> Get on the elliptical!<eos> You liked that Brussels sprout?<eos> ! Did you like that?
"Yeah. What have you got, blood diamonds?<eos> Go fuck yourself!"<eos> "Fucking sex slaves? Get out of here!<eos> I'll have him come aboard and rip that mask right off!"<eos> And you're just hanging with the gorilla.<eos> You get to have that experience of seeing the thing free for the first time.<eos> As it comes over the horizon, it finally sees the jungle.<eos> It's getting all excited.<eos> It jumps off the boat, it's rolling in the sand.<eos> "Buddy, we did it!
What did Father Brown say?<eos> I haven't showed it to him yet.<eos> Why not? !<eos> Well, he's just not himself today.<eos> Do you remember that Katherine Corven woman?<eos> The Black Widow?<eos> Who could forget?<eos> Even the broadsheets went gaga for her trial.<eos> Father Brown cracked the case, didn't he?<eos> Yes, he did.
What makes you say that?<eos> I'm not accusing you of killing Detective Chief Inspector Webb.<eos> Then, what?<eos> I'm accusing you of concealing Inspector Mallory's innocence.<eos> I suspect it's something personal.<eos> Do all priests read minds, Father?<eos> No.<eos> I was so pretty, so young.<eos> Do you know, the camera adored me?<eos> Everyone did.
Who's Roger?<eos> - Heh. Sorry.<eos> Never mind.<eos> - Everyone ready?<eos> - Ready.<eos> - Ready.<eos> The in-game tutorial is who I am.<eos> If you have any questions, then I am your man.<eos> Thanks, cloud man, we got this.<eos> Well, Barbie does.
And it's a horrible loss.<eos> Uh, that was...<eos> I-I'm just thrilled that you're both here to make this possible.<eos> The donor patient's room is at the end of this ICU.<eos> And you have the donor consent forms?<eos> Yeah, before we get to that, uh, Mr. Young is going to need you to explain to him why there's nothing more you can do for his son.<eos> What?<eos> No one's told him that yet?<eos> I thought he knew we were coming.<eos> Well, he does. It...
I definitely didn't picture him, like, happy without me.<eos> He talked a lot, didn't say anything about me.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Talked about Mom's laugh, his stupid tuxedo, coffee.<eos> I felt really stupid.<eos> You're not.<eos> Never occurred to me, all that time, that he didn't even...<eos> He really didn't even miss me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Oh, I do now.

I brought you a, water.<eos> Thanks, I'd love some.<eos> I'll let you two...<eos> I'll let you two...<eos> Excuse me. You like doing construction?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, it's great.<eos> You know, I get to...<eos> Iwatch something go up.<eos> Yeah, Johnny did construction, didn't he?
I know you.<eos> You... you made me breakfast in bed, and... and...<eos> You didn't need to do that.<eos> You wanted to.<eos> I think that you care about me.<eos> That's why you couldn't kill me before and why you can't do it now.<eos> Stop talking!<eos> Do this... and you will become everything you hate.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes... you do.
Hang more FFP.<eos> Right angle.<eos> Dr. Robbins, this baby's tanking.<eos> I think we need to get her into the O.R.<eos> Who's with you?<eos> Barton.<eos> Barton's no good for this.<eos> - You should go.<eos> - I need to be here.<eos> No, you don't.
- All right, scissors.<eos> - Instead of... you want to devote your time to bringing this hospital down and me along with it.<eos> Hey, I can't stop you.<eos> And I am done.<eos> Steri-Strip and dress the wounds, please.<eos> - Yeah, well done.<eos> - Yeah, uh, good job, Warren.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, don't you think so?<eos> No, I do.
That's what that was.<eos> It was a choice.<eos> You chose wrong.<eos> But it's not too late.<eos> You could still resign.<eos> You could still tell her that you made a mistake.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't make a mistake.<eos> I have a duty to this hospital.<eos> My chief asked me to step up, so I...<eos> Did she?
What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> She asked you a question.<eos> She needed an answer.<eos> I know.<eos> What kind of teacher are you?<eos> I mean, you don't just teach them what to do with their hands.<eos> You teach them what to do with this, how to live through this.<eos> I mean, you take it on yourself.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't!
- Sir, sir! Do not touch me!<eos> First scrubbed...<eos> I make the first cut.<eos> You okay?<eos> What do you mean, am I okay?<eos> The thing with the husband.<eos> Are you... I'm fine.<eos> Let's use the pelvic brim - as a landmark. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Dividing the ureter...<eos> How we doing?
- And what?<eos> It's just embarrassing being demoted.<eos> You were not demoted.<eos> From Chief of General Surgery to Trauma Attending?<eos> - It looks like that.<eos> - April, April.<eos> A title is only as good as the person who earned it.<eos> Grey is very good, but when she wasn't here, the person they turned to was you.<eos> Oh, I know...<eos> Do you?
You pick sides and defend them.<eos> You attack.<eos> You hurt people.<eos> You get hurt.<eos> How was it today?<eos> Bad as you thought it would be?<eos> Kind of.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> We have to, but...<eos> No, you don't.
Oh, right.<eos> Oh, and, uh, Mr. Boseman is here to see you.<eos> He... what?<eos> Did we have a negotiation?<eos> No.<eos> Okay, give me a minute.<eos> Adrian.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't know we had a meeting.<eos> No, no, we didn't.
Kurt, you're not 20 years old anymore.<eos> Get back into bed.<eos> You look so grumpy.<eos> I had to delay my whole day.<eos> What were you calling about this morning?<eos> What was I calling about?<eos> Yes.<eos> This morning.<eos> - I forget.<eos> - No. No, you didn't.
You get angry and you focus.<eos> Angry and you focus. All right?<eos> I'm pissed.<eos> I believe you.<eos> Thank you for answering questions today, Mr. Staple.<eos> Actually, that's two staples, not one.<eos> It's like a high-end magazine.<eos> Do you know that Ms. Quinn is not a co-conspirator to this malware?<eos> Yes, I do not.<eos> You do not?
Thank you.<eos> This is Diane Lockhart's office, and I'm her assistant, Marissa.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> It's Dr. Ainsworth at Harbor Hospital.<eos> - Do you want to call him back?<eos> - Please.<eos> Diane.<eos> You didn't like any of the applicants?<eos> For the assistant's job?<eos> No, I did.
Uh, there she is.<eos> One binder clip coming up.<eos> Ah. That's so gross.<eos> Okay, time to put those sticky fingers to work.<eos> What?<eos> Me?<eos> I need both hands to pinch the artery tight.<eos> You apply the glue.<eos> You know how I am about blood.<eos> I do.
Anyway, we have a date for a milkshake.<eos> Fuck, I hate being a good guy.<eos> - You may continue.<eos> - Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Dr. Norwood, let's turn to this embryo.<eos> Oh, um, excuse me, Your Honor.<eos> Norwood is going to England next week, too.<eos> Just like the Haights.<eos> Counselor, do you have something more for this witness?<eos> Yes, I do.
Hi.<eos> Hello. Do I know you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't think so, which is weird because we've been moving in the same circles for years.<eos> Okay.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Elsbeth Tascioni.<eos> Sure.<eos> I don't like eating alone, do you?<eos> - I do, actually.
I would never shake down Diedre.<eos> She's too lovely.<eos> Yeah, well, let's see what a disbarment committee says.<eos> Get home safe.<eos> Yeah, let's see what they say.<eos> What was your quote?<eos> Um...<eos> "When you go after me professionally," "I go after you personally."<eos> - I never said that.<eos> - Yes, you did.
It's a favor.<eos> Are we expecting trouble?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Well, actually, he said that he would.<eos> Maia?<eos> Dad.<eos> Hello, Henry.<eos> Diane.<eos> Maia, do you have a second? No.<eos> No, I don't.
We'll be right out.<eos> I don't think we should entangle your parents' money with my parents'.<eos> Is there something wrong with the fund?<eos> Are you good?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Listen, Maia, I can think of a dozen reasons why you didn't let Amy's parents invest.<eos> First and foremost, you didn't want to mix up finances with love.<eos> That makes complete sense to me.<eos> You think so?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Has Dad ever visited Earth before?<eos> Not that I'm aware of.<eos> And besides, why would He do so now?<eos> I don't know, maybe because we're plotting to overthrow Him.<eos> Even so, Luci, that's not the way Dad operates.<eos> If He has a problem, He sends an emissary, like me, or maybe a burning bush.<eos> So how does this God Johnson know Samael?<eos> My name.<eos> Wait, I know.<eos> - You do?
Healing.<eos> Gave him the power and knowledge of the divine.<eos> And when he found out that he could heal like that, he... he thought he was God.<eos> What's more important is that now the sword's complete, we can get on with our plan.<eos> So... the...<eos> Or not.<eos> Maybe there's another piece missing.<eos> Or maybe a dragon has to breathe on it.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Well, maybe Mum does.
She was murdered.<eos> I'm so sorry. Were you close?<eos> Yes.<eos> Not a speck to be found.<eos> Have you caught the killer?<eos> No.<eos> Clean as a whistle.<eos> Clean as a whistle.<eos> Do you know who he is?<eos> Yes, I do.
Can I help you with anything?<eos> I threw up.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mommy, can I play with your phone?<eos> - Can I play with your phone?<eos> - -Ay hijo.<eos> I want to play on your phone.<eos> You know what, here you go.<eos> It's wet. It doesn't work.<eos> Nothing does, okay? Okay? Okay?
- I can still access it.<eos> - Good.<eos> You're gonna reach out to him and blackmail him.<eos> With what?<eos> He destroyed all the evidence I had against him.<eos> We know that; he doesn't.<eos> You can tell him you have another copy, and he'll have to believe you.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Even if he believes she made another copy, he still has to believe she has a good reason to blackmail him.<eos> Well, luckily, she does.
I'm kidding.<eos> We're off the clock.<eos> So, stop pet-naming Riley and cut me a slice of this pie that Jack won't stop yapping about.<eos> Get in there.<eos> I'm guessing the apology went well.<eos> Well, a wise man once told me that "I'm sorry" only starts the conversation.<eos> So... who's ready for another game of truth or dare?<eos> I love truth or dare.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- I'll open up his vessels.<eos> It could save his life. Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Did you say erectile-dysfunction drugs?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hopefully somebody on board has some.<eos> Well, actually... we do.
I never thought I could fall in love so fast, but I've never felt like this about anyone.<eos> I'm so glad we found each other.<eos> Me too, dumpling.<eos> Every day.<eos> It's, like, affecting my body and soul.<eos> Does make you want to puke.<eos> Oh, my... Oh, God!<eos> It's only been a few months, but when you know, you just know.<eos> You know?<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bovie.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's get her on a morphine drip.<eos> All right, you're gonna be all right.<eos> - We have been looking for you!<eos> - You scared the crap out of me!<eos> - Oh, I need some O2.<eos> - Yeah, of course you do.
- It's okay.<eos> What if they're all dead?<eos> They're not.<eos> But what if they are?<eos> We haven't seen or heard from anyone.<eos> They're fine.<eos> She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Thanks.<eos> Soldier boy says thanks.<eos> Do you by any chance know how to hot-wire a car?<eos> Oh, what, just because I was in jail,<eos> - Shh, shh. What?<eos> You want to ask the black guy next?<eos> S-Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Of course I do.
Haven't you heard?<eos> I'm a faggot.<eos> I mean, God's love is everywhere.<eos> It's about accepting it.<eos> How do I do that?<eos> Well, often the first step is baptism, to open your heart... to let the sin out.<eos> Being gay is not a sin.<eos> Isn't lying a sin, Father?<eos> You lied about my son, didn't you?<eos> No, I didn't.
I'm Jonah?<eos> You're Jonah.<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I went to my mother's house, wanted to run away.<eos> And my mom was there.<eos> Or you know.<eos> And she wanted to help me die, and I didn't want to, and I was so surprised that I didn't, 'cause I have nothing to live for.<eos> Except...<eos> Except maybe... maybe I do.
You're lying.<eos> No, I'm... I'm not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I...<eos> I swear I'm not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> If you know something, tell me.<eos> When you release me, I'll tell you.<eos> - You don't know anything.<eos> - I do. I do.
A reminder.<eos> I'm gonna stay here.<eos> If that's cool, I mean.<eos> Keep an eye out.<eos> Do you know how long we've been looking for you?<eos> Since before any of this happened.<eos> I've been here with all these... civilians trying to make my way, and you just walk across my path.<eos> Do you...<eos> Do you really have no idea who I am?<eos> No. No, I don't.
I've got a front row seat.<eos> This is gonna be good.<eos> Well.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> I hope the good lord doesn't object to me switching sides like this.<eos> Well, she'd be a damn fool if she did.<eos> - I think it's safe from lightning bolts.<eos> - Mmh, you'd be surprised.<eos> You think that god is a woman?<eos> Yeah, of course I do. Don't you?
Frank, Frank, Frank, you're freaking me out, okay?<eos> What... what were you gonna do?<eos> Come on, Jules, don't... don't make me say it.<eos> Were you gonna kill him?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Jules, you don't understand...<eos> Oh, my God, you can't...<eos> I don't have a choice right now, I swear to God, if I did...<eos> You don't?
That was Detective Anderson.<eos> She and her partner would like me to come down to the station, answer a few questions.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> What?<eos> Babe. Did you tell them that I killed that cop?<eos> No.<eos> Allie, please.<eos> No, I... Because I don't know if you killed that cop.<eos> Because I don't know what you did that night at the fire.<eos> Yes, you do.
Yes?<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> I'm sorry, um...<eos> Okay.<eos> What?<eos> I just--I don't know if you accepted my apology.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Actually, no.<eos> No, I don't.
Um, hey, I-- I've gotta get home.<eos> Um... I had a good time.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> We can do it again.<eos> You said yesterday was cheat day.<eos> You can't... You can't cheat every day.<eos> I won't tell.<eos> No, I don't want to.<eos> So, what, you're...<eos> done with me?
Aunt essi said it was cool.<eos> It's fine.<eos> We were just leaving.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Look!<eos> There's your mama.<eos> Stasha, he started crying again.<eos> Mind if I ask how old he is.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Lab.<eos> There's a secret entrance behind that grating that leads down to the tunnel system.<eos> What secret base is complete without one?<eos> Your desk?<eos> My sister used to post up here.<eos> Loved her coffee.<eos> From the way Crane talks about her, she...<eos> She was something special.<eos> They had something special.<eos> We all did.
I enjoy long stories.<eos> Yeah, he does.<eos> In short, my fellow travelers and I...<eos> Fellowship, if you will.<eos> We're on a journey to destroy an object.<eos> One which would bring the bearer unimaginable power.<eos> Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I came across numerous obscure references to it in my studies.<eos> Of course, such a divine artifact could never actually exist.<eos> But it does.
Are you going to do another interview?<eos> No, I'm going home.<eos> We just don't understand.<eos> Why didn't you come to us?<eos> I knew you guys didn't have the money.<eos> You will always be our daughter, and we love you, Miriam.<eos> But I'm heartbroken.<eos> I just don't think you've really thought through what this is going to mean for the rest of your life.<eos> I know what I'm doing, daddy.<eos> Do you?
I prefer the term "business partner".<eos> Yeah, well, your business is killing people, and we have two children upstairs asleep!<eos> Greta...<eos> I did what I was paid to do.<eos> Yeah, and I don't want to constantly be reminded of that!<eos> What do you expect me to do?<eos> You want me to disappear into some gutter?<eos> Hey, Lyle...<eos> Lyle, she did not mean that.<eos> Actually, I did!
That's what I'm saying.<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, we got about 15 minutes left on, shift.<eos> And we couldn't catch that rat, but the place has never looked more spic-and-span.<eos> So... we're gonna wind it down.<eos> Good.<eos> You want to go get some breakfast and talk?<eos> I know losing Louie wasn't what...<eos> I don't.
I want you to tell me everything you know about this, about what's happening.<eos> Why?<eos> Because one of us is getting pulled out there soon.<eos> Listen, I know you never thought I was cut out for this job, but I was, and I am.<eos> So finish what you started telling me on the way to the bunker.<eos> Prove to me I didn't get shot for nothing.<eos> Splendid, so we got a wanted man on the loose in Munich, multiple intelligence agencies looking for him, and no idea where he is.<eos> We didn't prepare for this.<eos> We don't have a plan.<eos> But we do.
_<eos> _<eos> You get him to the rendezvous point.<eos> - I'll meet you there.<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> Is this what you wanted?<eos> Not just get yourself killed, but your recruits, too?<eos> How do we even know they're Bundes... Bundes...<eos> Bundesnachrichtendienst?<eos> We don't.
Gunned down on her way home from work?<eos> Who deserves that?<eos> After everything you've been through, you should be stronger than this.<eos> And after everything you've been through, you should know better.<eos> This...<eos> This is a person.<eos> I don't know who she is.<eos> I don't know what she did...<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't.
How does this help?<eos> We know they killed their occupants on specific orders.<eos> I think these ones are off network, for repairs<eos> - so they can't receive commands.<eos> - What if you're wrong?<eos> Well, we'll be horribly murdered!<eos> Let's say I'm right.<eos> Doctor, if those suits have killed 36 people that means there's 36 corpses walking about this station.<eos> You know, that REALLY doesn't matter right now.<eos> Correction: yeah, it does.
Look, a stone cairn - Pictish civilisation.<eos> The bird!<eos> What about it?<eos> It said "dark".<eos> Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.<eos> But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.<eos> It's a crow. All crows talk.<eos> They don't talk in the future.<eos> Course they do.
I don't walk out of here in 30 seconds, you'll never see your diamonds again.<eos> Giannusa's not with them.<eos> Pay up.<eos> Bollocks.<eos> You may wanna call your boss.<eos> What the hell are you saying?<eos> Okay- - What?<eos> Slow do-- hey.<eos> Hey, you said the diamonds would be at the warehouse.<eos> No, I didn't.
- where you were?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He was angry, and he was yelling something about Meghan.<eos> I was afraid he was gonna hurt her.<eos> You told Meghan Joe killed your mom.<eos> Is that true, Robbie?<eos> Your mom wasn't the only one, did you know that?<eos> What happened to your mom, Robbie?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do!
I think that was Moreno, burying the hatchet.<eos> Ah, the man's just sharpening his blade.<eos> Now there's gonna be a trial, and you're gonna be asked to testify, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> And Meghan, he's gonna go away for life.<eos> You're never gonna have to worry about him hurting you again.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> And thank you for letting me stay here today.<eos> You have a really nice family.<eos> I do.
Or else anyone could claim it.<eos> They'll have to describe it to me when they get in touch.<eos> It is a single tramp's shoe that you f...<eos> That you found in the street.<eos> Now just give it to Oxfam.<eos> They won't have it.<eos> They wouldn't take those Angelina Ballerina videos. Nothing wrong with them!<eos> Because they're videos!<eos> People don't have video players any more!<eos> The library does!
I mean, Regina may have charged in to save Robin the Hero's life, but me?<eos> Much less likely.<eos> Enchanted ropes.<eos> The only way you're going anywhere is if I allow it.<eos> And that's not going to happen until I lure Regina here and destroy her.<eos> Do you really think killing Regina is gonna solve your problems?<eos> All it will do is make a martyr of her, and then nobody will be able to look at you without thinking of her.<eos> Believe me, that part is no fun at all.<eos> Well, I suppose you have a better idea.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Just promise me... you won't waste a single minute.<eos> Where do you think she went?<eos> There's no way to know for sure, but... I have my ideas.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> If you're gonna kidnap me again, may I humbly request I'm allowed to finish my ale first?<eos> I'm not here to kidnap you.<eos> And I'm... I'm sorry about that.<eos> So, if you're standing here, can I assume that the villain plan didn't work out so well?<eos> It didn't.
We haven't been alone in almost two weeks.<eos> We've both been busy.<eos> We live across the street from each other, Paige.<eos> Where is this coming from?<eos> I-- I'm scared.<eos> Of what?<eos> I like you.<eos> A lot. But... I've never had a boyfriend before.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> Yes, you do.
Yes.<eos> You come with me.<eos> - I will explain everything.<eos> - No.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Why? It would put him in terrible danger.<eos> It is not safe for him.<eos> But I come for him.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do.
Everybody's here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna head upstairs.<eos> That guy in the lab...<eos> That can't happen ever again.<eos> We'll be more careful.<eos> More careful?<eos> This has been hard for me for a long time.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I do.
It's a good thing to realize that there are things bigger than you.<eos> Most people never figure that out.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Jesus spent his whole life teaching us that.<eos> And realizing it leads to empathy, but empathy leads us to help others, to make sacrifices in our own life for the benefit of someone else.<eos> His crucifixion was the ultimate example of that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course, you're important, too.<eos> I hope you know that.<eos> I do.
Men.<eos> Nobody suitable.<eos> Well, as soon as your language improves, we'll see to it that we find you a job at a paper or in publishing, translating.<eos> Y-You'll meet people.<eos> Clark thinks about you, Martha.<eos> He wanted to send you a letter, but it's not allowed.<eos> He's the reason I talked to your parents.<eos> He insisted.<eos> He wants what's best for you.<eos> We all do.
- What are you talking about?<eos> I don't know... I don't know what you're talk...<eos> Where's the signal?<eos> Get it back.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - Jiya, try it.<eos> - I just want to talk.<eos> - Want to talk about what, okay?<eos> I came to you 'cause you said that you had a way to end all of this.<eos> And I do.
And you break it, and share it with the opener and the headliner.<eos> And you make it through another show.<eos> And that way you get days like today, where it all seems like it was meant to be.<eos> Happy anniversary to show business audience of over 20 years.<eos> I love you all far more deeply than the day we first met, and the fact that we all still have the free will to abandon each other at any given moment... makes it all the more compelling.<eos> I'm back, I came back!<eos> But I don't, it's my special, but I don't want to come back, but I'm coming back!<eos> No, okay, okay.<eos> But what if I didn't come back?<eos> But I did, I did.
We have 100,000 people living on the streets.<eos> We need more of me.<eos> More places where you can take the emotional equivalent of a shopping cart full of dead car batteries and pull it up.<eos> I'm a very good place to squat.<eos> I cannot provide you any services, but... if you're at a party, or you stand around, don't feel welcome, come sit next to me.<eos> I can be a shelter from the storm.<eos> Uh, I like my job, but sometimes I lie about what I do, uh... because, uh, sometimes I say I'm a bookkeeper, you know?<eos> If I'm in a closed space.<eos> I wish I am.<eos> I do all my own Quicken and QuickBooks.
It's okay, Jay.<eos> Some boys have different gifts.<eos> Let me get the door.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> - Hi. Can I help you?<eos> - I'm here for Lily.<eos> I always knew this day would come.<eos> Probably not what she's here for.<eos> How do you know our daughter?<eos> I don't.
What the fuck is a matter with you?<eos> So you're not gonna sign it?<eos> No, I'm not gonna sign this!<eos> Jesus!<eos> You're a fucking sadist, you know that?<eos> You're demented!<eos> I'm almost tempted to let you have a run at it just to watch you waste your fucking time.<eos> This technology did not work when Peter theorized it, and it doesn't work now.<eos> It-It, um... It actually does work now.<eos> It does.
Butch Cassidy and his head of business development.<eos> Oh, wow, another Western reference. Yaw!<eos> Let's go.<eos> You know, he'd hire you, too.<eos> What?<eos> All you have to do is admit that you want the job.<eos> And, like, get down on your knees and beg.<eos> Says the guy who's romancing a woman through a phone that isn't even on.<eos> A woman that he described to me in private as a skinny little fuck factory.<eos> Oh, no, I didn't.
Give me the phone.<eos> Dinesh. Give it to me.<eos> You are not thinking clearly.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Looks like we both lose.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> How do you figure?<eos> 'Cause now I know you had some embarrassing shit to hide. I don't even need to know what it is.<eos> My phone may be in the toilet, but... but I win.<eos> No, you don't.
PoopFare?<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You sacrificed... everything that we've worked for... for PoopFare?<eos> How was PoopFare... for the greater good?<eos> It wasn't.<eos> You compared yourself to Abraham Lincoln, Richard.<eos> Can you do me a favor?<eos> Can you say it so I know I'm not hallucinating?<eos> - I just did.
You can't erase any of that, but you can help Alice.<eos> You can help Alice now.<eos> - You look worried.<eos> - Just thinking about Alice.<eos> She's gonna be really pissed at me.<eos> - Yeah, but when she has her shade back, she'll get it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Um... Speaking of shades, since this is probably the last time I'm going to have one...<eos> - Look, you do not have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You've just crossed it.<eos> You could've helped me today.<eos> Yeah. You're right.<eos> I could have.<eos> You almost got me thrown out.<eos> You called him my friend.<eos> Who?<eos> Elliot.<eos> You said you were not my friend who died.<eos> Yeah, I did.
We're a family.<eos> We're safe.<eos> You should be here with us now.<eos> We can stop the accident.<eos> We're not gonna decide anything tonight.<eos> I don't want to give up on this either.<eos> 'Cause I don't know what I would do without you.<eos> You do have me, Dad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You shouldn't.<eos> She won't for you.<eos> I don't want to do things I shouldn't.<eos> I left the man who loved me, and wanted nothing in return.<eos> I'm getting ready to kill people. For that son of a bitch.<eos> And I'm doing it so I can give money to another son of a bitch.<eos> The truth is those sons of bitches live on a different planet.<eos> It should be one world for all.<eos> It's not your decision to make.<eos> Who does?
So, as the man in charge of the response to the Thorpe attack, you could make sure the city chose to buy your filters, making you very rich.<eos> Is this about me failing to reveal a conflict of interests, or are you accusing me of orchestrating the attack?<eos> You tell us.<eos> If it's the first one... guilty as charged.<eos> And I'll pay whatever penalty I'm due.<eos> But the other one, that's, that's a fairy tale.<eos> Are you saying that I hired Raymond Thorpe?<eos> Is that it?<eos> I don't even know him.<eos> Actually, you do.
Look at that hair.<eos> Rock'n'roll.<eos> Nice guitar, man.<eos> $3,200, that's pricey.<eos> Yeah, they're proud of 'em.<eos> Yep.<eos> You lookin' for a guitar today?<eos> Actually, I'm lookin' for a keyboard.<eos> You got any good used keys around?<eos> We do, we do.
I'm so sorry, love.<eos> You said you were in Peru.<eos> I took no joy in deceiving youl wanted to be sure before I told you.<eos> Before I risked<eos> I know how comfortable you are with our life, with what we have.<eos> All I know is that when Richard called, I knew what he was saying was true.<eos> Please...<eos> None of us knows what's true.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Your hands...<eos> We had taken the medicine.<eos> There was a campfire.<eos> When I woke up, you and Silas and Steve told me the story. But I didn't see any of it.<eos> "The story"?<eos> Tell them that you acted out of spite, that you'll support their leadership.<eos> It's over.<eos> I want you home with me.<eos> I... I, want to apologize and, to be clear... she knows how badly she's fucked up.<eos> Bill She does.
God damn it.<eos> God damn it!<eos> - Where's Quentin?<eos> - What?<eos> Shit.<eos> Julia's not here either.<eos> What?<eos> I don't understand. You have a new weapon<eos> - to kill Reynard?<eos> - No, you do.
Power failure in itself would cause pandemics, riots, looting and chaos.<eos> And our power grid has been sold off to greedy private enterprises.<eos> I don't care that you don't know where the nearest bomb shelter is.<eos> But don't bring a little person into the world and then get rid of your fireplace!<eos> Hey, bro...<eos> Leif?<eos> - Leif!<eos> - It's fine. Thanks for having me.<eos> Leif told me you can help me get a new face.<eos> - Did he, now? - Yes.
Spock, find me the rest of that kill code.<eos> I'll be on the bridge.<eos> Jim?<eos> How is it with you and Avi?<eos> She's an incredible engineer.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> You remember.<eos> We each chose our separate paths.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> With enough time some things do.
So, a scientist really did survive.<eos> That's a Gravitational Beam Emitter, right?<eos> Quite an impressive gun.<eos> That's the one technology that even we couldn't re-create.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> I don't know about the gun.<eos> There are vestiges of the contagion in your irises.<eos> You... don't have the Net Terminal Gene.<eos> What sort of stupid thing is that to say?<eos> Of course I don't.
What does our "A" game mean?<eos> We just have to be professional.<eos> But I'm feeling... I feel like I've been pretty professional so far, thank you.<eos> I don't think I'm exactly amateur hour.<eos> I know, but I-I guess I'm just a little nervous.<eos> I want everything to go good.<eos> Well, do you have any questions prepared?<eos> I have a ton, they're in my backpack.<eos> Do you have my backpack by the way?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Cute babysitter.<eos> Old enough to drive. Too young to vote.<eos> Such a tight little window.<eos> You did well today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But we're missing one bag.<eos> I gave it away so we could escape.<eos> It wasn't yours to give.<eos> - We didn't have a cho...<eos> - But you did.
One night, I was camped out by this stream, just sitting there, thinking.<eos> It was real quiet... hardly any wind.<eos> Then... out of nowhere...<eos> It was a mountain lion.<eos> The bastard snuck up about 10 feet behind me.<eos> And in that moment, I knew...<eos> "So, this is how I die.<eos> After the Comanches, the Tonks, the Rangers, the Union Army, the thugs, the bandits, a goddamn lion will be my end!"<eos> How'd you get away?<eos> I didn't.
I don't forget friends.<eos> You gotta trust me.<eos> My tribe needs me.<eos> I need to go back.<eos> Your tribe.<eos> Those Lamanites did a number on you, didn't they?<eos> Heck, I thought you said it was one of them that pushed you off the cliff.<eos> _ but he's the only one.<eos> I've got a father and brothers and... And that girl you said I'm gonna marry.<eos> So I did.
I guess you just can't talk yourself into love.<eos> I can talk myself into anything.<eos> I like salad now!<eos> Here comes the boffo ending, Dad.<eos> - (sniffles): It's beautiful.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Aw, Bob.<eos> You identify with Meat Man.<eos> (sniffs) I just think it's a good movie, Lin.<eos> Everybody does.
The Savior.<eos> Mom, it's true.<eos> Henry, you have to accept these things are not real.<eos> And bringing me to some rooftop is not gonna convince me that my mother is Snow White.<eos> But she is.<eos> And this isn't just some rooftop.<eos> This is where you married your true love yesterday.<eos> My true love?<eos> Sorry, kid. That's not the way the world works.<eos> It does, and it did for you.
And you left Snow behind?<eos> But I have the bean. And that's the priority... getting back home to Emma, to Henry.<eos> She'll find David. She always does.<eos> Well, we have a problem.<eos> What the devil happened to it?<eos> Emma.<eos> Her lack of belief. It's sapping the magic from everything here.<eos> Well, can't you fix it? Make it work?<eos> Well, I can't. I'm... I don't... have enough power.<eos> Of course you do, sis.
Ready for a new adventure?<eos> _<eos> Uh... hello?<eos> Hi. Are you Henry Mills?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Who are you?<eos> My name's Lucy.<eos> I'm your daughter.<eos> I don't have a daughter.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Or somebody threw it.<eos> I have a dimmer view of humanity than you.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Hey, Brett...<eos> Cruz, don't!<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> What?<eos> What the hell!<eos> You see what I mean?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I really love this guy.<eos> I met him on a dating app.<eos> Yeah. We met-- When I signed up, they were like,<eos> "Congratulations.<eos> You have a free lifetime membership."<eos> And I was like, "Well, that's discouraging." Like, "What the fuck?"<eos> When I met him, he was the first-- He's the only guy I met on there.<eos> I liked him right away. I really liked him.<eos> I was like, "I'm gonna make this guy wait."<eos> And I did.
Lucado!<eos> Home. We are legion once more.<eos> Hey. OK.<eos> Look, we're gonna take a walk<eos> - over to the holding cell, OK?<eos> - Yes, we are. To free my other.<eos> Dolls... get back.<eos> Don't let it touch you.<eos> Oh, Dolls!<eos> You did it!
Janice it is.<eos> No, you're not naming him Janice.<eos> Guys, look, he's obviously got a name, and he'll tell us when he's ready.<eos> But in the meantime, we have to call him something.<eos> I mean, kids need names.<eos> It gives them confidence, self-esteem.<eos> Half the kids in jail never had names.<eos> That's why they give them numbers.<eos> Ooh, how about Jansport?<eos> We already did that one.
It is no longer your apartment.<eos> It is our home.<eos> We have the extra bedroom.<eos> My motorcycle room?<eos> I am not losing my bikes to your yard sale.<eos> We're gonna finish this conversation later.<eos> We're busy fighting. What's up?<eos> We got a case.<eos> Really cool stuff.<eos> You and Happy almost done?
Oh, no.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - Oh, crap.<eos> Hey, Walt, uh, look, it's not Princess and the Pea quality, but it should stop you from breaking most of your bones.<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> I just want to know from Paige, why did you tell me you loved me?<eos> Mom.<eos> Did you really say that to Walter?<eos> Um... honey, I don't recall.<eos> Yes, you do.
Because if it is, I have no choice but to dismiss you from our training program.<eos> What?<eos> He's out of the CFD.<eos> That's our rules.<eos> It was my order, sir.<eos> What do you mean, "my order"?<eos> I told Harris to start CPR.<eos> We had multiple victims suffering from cyanide poisoning when the cook went into cardiac arrest.<eos> - So, you saw this?<eos> - I did.
You haven't told Bert, have you?<eos> Wanna scare off a potential guy lickety-split?<eos> Tell him in three years you won't be able to swallow or chew... or breathe without their help.<eos> I didn't get a lot of calls for a second date, so when I met Bert...<eos> Look...<eos> Bert and I may have run our course, but keeping this from him<eos> - is a mistake.<eos> - I'm selfish, I know.<eos> I'm scared to spend the last few years of my life alone, you know.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Any reason he'd be avoiding us?<eos> Hiding something, maybe?<eos> Or maybe he's taking some time off after being buried alive in a terrorist ambush.<eos> Could be, could be.<eos> A lot of agents lost their lives in that raid.<eos> According to my notes here, there's some discussion about whether or not to abort the mission once you realized communications were down.<eos> Now, do you agree with Assistant Director Weller's decision to move in anyway?<eos> He didn't give that order.<eos> - Really?<eos> Who did?
That's unfortunate, but it's still an even match.<eos> Stand still and accept your fate!<eos> You first!<eos> You cannot win, for I believe I am impervious to your attacks.<eos> I believe I will break free.<eos> Quill!<eos> Eyes on the enemy!<eos> Tell your cowardly wooden friend to give us the sarcophagus!<eos> He doesn't have it!<eos> None of us do!
It appears you were telling the truth after all.<eos> At least the part about the walking tree not having the sarcophagus.<eos> Well, look who joined the party.<eos> The original Black Order Believer himself, Ebony Maw.<eos> Apparently, I'll need to extract the location of the sarcophagus directly from your minds.<eos> Good luck with that!<eos> Even the most powerful Believer can't just wish for that kind of mental ability.<eos> I don't need to wish.<eos> I believe.<eos> More importantly, so does everyone on that ship.
I've had a television show. I wouldn't have done that shit.<eos> He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped.<eos> Here comes the kicker. You ready?<eos> Here's the fact that I heard, but haven't confirmed.<eos> I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for.<eos> So, you understand what I'm saying?<eos> The point is this:<eos> He rapes, but he saves.<eos> And he saves more than he rapes.<eos> But he probably does rape.
Do what?<eos> Be her voice. Minna.<eos> Me?<eos> I need the help.<eos> And no one else can seem to get it right.<eos> I'm not...<eos> It's just a few lines, Kathleen.<eos> Just a few lines, yeah.<eos> I don't mind doing this.<eos> Really, I-I don't.
National Security Division.<eos> It's in Washington, D.C.<eos> Wow, that's-that's... that's a big deal.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> They want me ASAP, and I've been putting them off.<eos> Why?<eos> You have to ask?<eos> Look, I'm not one to cut and run, and neither are you.<eos> But whatever this is between us, it deserves a chance, don't you think?<eos> Yes, I do.
It's a modern-day classic.<eos> I bet you still haven't seen it.<eos> It's on my list.<eos> Sure you should be doing that?<eos> Celebrating my miraculous survival.<eos> Shot point-blank, barely a scratch.<eos> Looks like more than a scratch to me.<eos> Yeah, well.<eos> - You should see the other guy.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
Is that normal?<eos> I should've never given them to you.<eos> I like it, though, you know?<eos> I feel like I'm firing on all cylinders.<eos> Oh, good, well, maybe you can use those cylinders to lead us to where the narcotics are hidden.<eos> I was just kidding, Sebastian.<eos> We have to do it the old-fashioned way.<eos> We need to check every locker.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
Spencer wasn't at NOPD, Patton.<eos> Where are you on his location?<eos> I got GPS on his cell phone.<eos> Spencer just left Orleans Parish jail.<eos> According to the records, he got custody of Marino.<eos> He's gonna kill Richard and make sure he takes the fall.<eos> Unless we stop him.<eos> You got yourself into a real mess here, Richard.<eos> You know I didn't do what they're accusing me of, right?<eos> Yeah, of course we do, Marino.
See?<eos> We're not so different.<eos> We both sacrifice for what we believe is right, Kurt.<eos> That's why I wanted you for our new government.<eos> You're dedicated, you're honorable.<eos> I knew that no matter how much you'd hate me for what I'd done, you'd do the right thing for your country.<eos> You can't be corrupted Kurt.<eos> Stop calling me Kurt!<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
- From first shift.<eos> - But his girlfriend asked him to move in with her, so now we're screwed.<eos> This was supposed to save me money, not cast me.<eos> Leon is starting community college in Florida, and Cruz is footing the bill.<eos> I get this new bouncer gig and that helps, but...<eos> What about me?<eos> For a roommate.<eos> 'Cause I've been going nuts trying to find a new place within my price range before my landlord doubles my rent, so it would really help me out.<eos> And you know I'm not a serial killer, so...<eos> - Do we?
- Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Anna, you don't have to worry about that.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway...<eos> I bet once you go talk to her, you'll find out it's not the things for her, either.<eos> When you find out what it is, you can help her.<eos> Who says I'm gonna go talk to her?<eos> I did.
If there's anything you have to say, now is the time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you go see her?<eos> What?<eos> The lady from the house.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you... for these last few months.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Don't do that.
- Excuse me?<eos> - You don't come home.<eos> I slept at Severide's, and I texted you that.<eos> I don't give a damn what you texted.<eos> That is not how marriage works, Matt.<eos> We don't text.<eos> We talk things out.<eos> Talking involves listening, Gabby, and you're not doing that.<eos> Listen, I understand you wanting to help out your dad.<eos> You do?
Your left anterior descending artery is 80% blocked.<eos> Now, that is the largest artery.<eos> It supplies half the heart with blood.<eos> The question is "Am I done?"<eos> I can do a surgical replacement of the valve, and, while I'm in there, do a bypass for the blocked artery.<eos> Are you talking open heart surgery?<eos> It would involve opening your chest, yes.<eos> Now, if you wanted to go non-surgical, a cardiologist could place a clip on the mitral valve to try and control the regurge and do angioplasty... to open up the blocked artery.<eos> Do you have a good cardiologist?<eos> We do, but I...

Corn and, uh, rice, 500, uh, bushels.<eos> Beans, all types, 500 barrels.<eos> One hundred shovels.<eos> One hundred axes. Ow!<eos> Oh, we mustn't bore Antonio with details, Rogers.<eos> Papa.<eos> No gloves, Uberta?<eos> Let's get you inside before you get even more liver spots.<eos> I don't have liver spots, Rogers.<eos> She does. Ah!
Good work, Bob!<eos> Jean-Bob.<eos> Skunk Breath approaches.<eos> My dearest Uberta... Ow!<eos> You're late!<eos> I, uh... I'm so sorry, dearest.<eos> What's wrong? Ugh!<eos> It's your breath!<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Well, now you do.
It's a secret you'll never admit to.<eos> Go.<eos> Up till now, Cat Adams has only worked solo.<eos> But this is a partnership.<eos> So we need to figure out how these two hit women were able to work together, especially when one of them was in solitary.<eos> And hit men are drive by profit and self-preservation.<eos> They don't take a job unless they know all the angles.<eos> So, to predict their behavior, we need to ask ourselves a simple question.<eos> We know why Cat wanted revenge on Reid.<eos> Why does Lindsey?
And I know they wanted you to move their heroin, and I also know that if you didn't, you would have been next, right?<eos> Spence, anyone in your spot would have done the same thing.<eos> You wouldn't have.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would have, Spence.<eos> If someone was threatening my life, you bet your ass I would.<eos> It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?<eos> She does.<eos> She does.

He's the son of a close friend of mine.<eos> Anyway, we're new members.<eos> George Kenderson.<eos> I'm fairly new to the club as well.<eos> How'd you hear about it?<eos> I, um...<eos> I didn't.<eos> You didn't hear about it?<eos> That seems rather odd.<eos> - Does it? - Mm-hmm.
Captain.<eos> Hey. What is going on in the kitchen?<eos> It's insanely packed.<eos> They're all just taking a break.<eos> Why is nobody breaking in the new break room?<eos> - 'Cause it's a giant turd.<eos> - It's the worst.<eos> It's unusable.<eos> You guys don't even like it.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Uh, but what about the waters?<eos> Really liking the park idea.<eos> Say no more, big guy.<eos> Jasper, you ready, child?<eos> Don't talk like that.<eos> Oh. Uh, okay.<eos> "Carol Andrew Pilbasian Miller, loving wife, devoted friend, died in childbirth after a torturous, protracted, bloody labor."<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're not writing a damn obituary.<eos> Oh, no, newspapers do it in advance all the time.
But you're right, Lois.<eos> I'm gonna change.<eos> I'm gonna do all the stuff for you that Larry was doing.<eos> No, Peter, I don't need any of that.<eos> At our age, all I'm really looking for in a husband is someone who wants to watch TV with me on a Saturday night and isn't afraid to pop a zit on my back.<eos> "Afraid"?<eos> I love doing that.<eos> It's like bubble wrap you get to have sex with every now and then.<eos> I got a pretty good one going right now, Peter.<eos> You always do, Lois.
Until I met you.<eos> And I knew then, just like I know how to assemble engines, that you and me, Toby... we fit.<eos> You're my home.<eos> Okay, Padre.<eos> Get it together, you're up.<eos> Thank you, Ralph.<eos> Do you, Tobias Merriweather Curtis, take Happy Quinn to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> You bet I do.<eos> And do you, Happy Quinn...<eos> I do.
You need to go back to production.<eos> -Time is tickling. -[Lust chuckles]<eos> Our relationship is not as weird as people would assume.<eos> We have, like, a normal... -healthy sex life, I guess. -[chuckling]<eos> -It's not that special. -[laughs]<eos> "It's not that special."<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Sorry.<eos> [Pablo] Erika, she takes all the creative work.<eos> And I do more of the operational and the human resources and marketing work.
- Oh, Wendy!<eos> And her landlord wants everything out of the apartment.<eos> So I guess we're going to San Francisco.<eos> - Pass.<eos> - Pass?<eos> They can dump her stuff in the bay, for all I care.<eos> - Oh, Bonnie...<eos> - That's two!<eos> You don't want to find out what happens at three!<eos> You don't.
That's called kidnapping.<eos> How about Hawaii?<eos> I need some eyes on the ground there.<eos> What?<eos> She's nervous about Adam going to Hawaii with his ex-wife for a funeral.<eos> Oh, and she should be.<eos> Funerals are basically orgies with a cold, stiff guy in the corner.<eos> Amen, sister.<eos> Yeah, you like me better than his mean old ex-wife.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Ray did most of it.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> And that's not what I'm talking about.<eos> You've been sober for four years now, you're almost done with college, on your way to becoming a lawyer.<eos> I am so proud of you.<eos> Wow, Mom, that means a lot.<eos> Hey, I probably don't say this enough, but you are an amazing person, and I love you.<eos> You have another legal problem, don't you?<eos> I might have slapped a meter maid, but that doesn't take away from anything I said.<eos> It does a little, but thanks.
Now Internet searches have become the primary arbiter of legitimacy in every profession.<eos> So this... this star is all you need to be a detective in New York.<eos> For $278 in annual fees, anyone can advertise using this, and gain access to NYOOPI's all-important Web site.<eos> So here, have your pick.<eos> Disgraced FBI agents, idiots off the street, me.<eos> We are all equal in the eyes of this group.<eos> You're being a snob.<eos> Someone has to be.<eos> Did you get my text earlier, about why Fred Kirby might have been harassing Virginia Spivey and the others?<eos> I did.
- Old-fashioned.<eos> - I got you.<eos> Old-fashioned.<eos> And one of these.<eos> So, what's it like being a strategist for the only coalition of states saying "no" to the convention?<eos> It doesn't much matter.<eos> Roarke has his 38 states.<eos> Still, I wrote a hell of a barnburner for the New York delegation to give during floor debate.<eos> Why does this feel like a double date all of a sudden?<eos> My God. It does!
I'm even afraid to go back to Spain.<eos> I don't want to tarnish my family's name.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You're sorry.<eos> You said that already.<eos> If you... ever need anything...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need you to destroy Roarke.<eos> I believed every lie he told me.<eos> And America does, too.
And once it's done, he won't be able to get out.<eos> Since my life is on the line, I just have to know... what are the Russians giving you for this?<eos> They're not giving us anything.<eos> We're using them to take Roarke out.<eos> How can you be so sure this will work?<eos> The Russians could do anything with that intelligence.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> And I know I don't have a right to ask you to do this.<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't.

He just needs a little something to look at to get him started.<eos> How's this view?<eos> It's better.<eos> And now?<eos> I think I need to drink after all.<eos> I've got some vodka downstairs somewhere.<eos> Be right back.<eos> We are screwed.<eos> He doesn't have a computer in here.<eos> Yes, he does.
Hey, guys.<eos> Hey!<eos> What did you think of the race?<eos> Great.<eos> You were so fast!<eos> You were like a human car.<eos> Yeah, vroom.<eos> Amazing.<eos> You didn't see it.<eos> No. No, we didn't.
I'm like, "You all right?<eos> Are you all right?"<eos> My kids are terrified of the dog.<eos> My daughter goes to pet the dog, dog goes like...<eos> She's like, "Should I pet her?" "I don't think you should ever pet our dog, honey."<eos> I took her to the vet. I took the dog to ask her what to do.<eos> The vet said, "Listen, I think there's something you should seriously consider."<eos> I was like, "Please be saying to kill this dog.<eos> Please be a doctor that says the dog dies now."<eos> But she didn't.
Pff! You know.<eos> And, Poovey, book her as a Jane Doe.<eos> A what?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Well, at least let me talk to her.<eos> No. I told you, you can't.<eos> Little Miss Vanderpanties is in solitary, down in the sub-basement.<eos> Yeah! And why do you think that is?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> - Wh... because you do!
Intriguing.<eos> All right.<eos> Give me a hint.<eos> Two words:<eos> Charlotte Vandertunt.<eos> The heiress to the Vast Vandertunt Publishing Fortune?<eos> And, by inference, an ideal target for kidnapping.<eos> I'm not kidnapping a Vandertunt.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I already did.
So, uh, what are we doing?<eos> Are we just--<eos> Do you not see the phone to my ear?<eos> I- - I do, but-- What?
We just did.<eos> You want what I'm selling or not?<eos> I'm all in.<eos> He's in.<eos> Good.<eos> Devon, we have a problem in Chicago.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> I forgot your present.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.
Yeah.<eos> You know exactly who I am.<eos> And I know exactly what you are, which is a drug dealer and a whore.<eos> And I'm not just gonna stand here and bat my eyelashes while you wreck where I lay my head.<eos> Do you really think your husband would have an old woman like me when he can have a young beauty like yourself?<eos> With all the amount of money and power your husband has, he can have any woman he wants.<eos> What are you doing up there so late?<eos> My business runs on a 24-hour clock.<eos> It doesn't stop at 6:00.<eos> And neither does his billing.
Ha!<eos> And yes. Hold on.<eos> No way. Eep, did you miss the part about the booby traps?<eos> Oh, Eep's grown-up enough to handle 'em.<eos> Here's a map to two halves of another map.<eos> I might have gone overboard in hiding it.<eos> Put 'em together to find where I hid my treasure, because I do not remember. At all.<eos> - [Eep laughing]<eos> - Good luck. - Booby traps, here I come.<eos> - Not alone, you don't.
You wanted to kill me.<eos> Prepared.<eos> I was prepared to kill you.<eos> Being prepared for something doesn't necessarily speak to desire, and here we are.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'm told you're opening offices in Paris and London.<eos> My accountant's untimely demise left the door wide open for you to purchase that fleet of cruise ships for a song.<eos> - Well, now...<eos> - I know what happened with Von Hauser.<eos> Everyone does.
Hey, so, I don't know, like, uh... how was the library?<eos> Great.<eos> I got a lot of homework done.<eos> No, you didn't because it was closed!<eos> Boom lowered!<eos> That's right.<eos> We went to the library to look for you, but you weren't there.<eos> Wait, you guys are checking up on me?<eos> I'm 14, I don't need you guys looking over my shoulder all the time.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
Please. A blind man could read that jury.<eos> Why didn't you just take the deal, Benny?<eos> You don't even need your license.<eos> Everybody knows you practice pretend law for Dr. Bull.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's what this is about to you, huh, Will?<eos> How I make my living?<eos> I'm just saying, this trial could go sideways.<eos> I don't want to see anything bad happen to you.<eos> No one does.
-See you.<eos> Tomorrow around ten, right?<eos> Is that a good time?<eos> Ten o'clock is great.<eos> Human life should be good regardless of gender.<eos> This whole gender oppression thing is lived in different ways by a transgender person, who is questioning precisely these formulas, these cages.<eos> Angeli, could you please ask a question?<eos> I would like to know...<eos> We worked together, we still do.<eos> -We still do.
60 years to do.<eos> I did it at a time when the cost was very low.<eos> What could I lose?<eos> Work?<eos> Very unlikely.<eos> I already had enough capital in professional respect.<eos> I could have lost something.<eos> "Oh, let's not hire that transvestite."<eos> It could have happened.<eos> But it didn't.
I thought we decided against that.<eos> No, it's... it's for a friend.<eos> She's... wondering where she came from.<eos> Thinks she's... she was... adopted. Maybe.<eos> And is that something on your mind?<eos> - Adoption?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean... not "no". I mean, I know...<eos> Know that you have options?<eos> Because you do.
It's right near Juan Carlo's chop shop.<eos> Enjoy your righteousness and your protein shakes.<eos> Waverly wants you to join her at Shorty's for nachos.<eos> Oh! Sounds good.<eos> I just gotta...<eos> Thought we've done this dance before.<eos> You know I'm not a bad guy.<eos> And you got into my truck... after you decked me.<eos> You said you have answers. About the venomous vixens.<eos> - I do.
Yeah, it's hard to imagine him doing what you think he did.<eos> We'll give you whatever we have on him.<eos> Hey.<eos> How is Shinwell?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Shinwell.<eos> Shinwell Johnson.<eos> Sleepy-eyed gang informant, chess aficionado, murderer-- ring any bells?<eos> You saw the text I got last night.<eos> I did not.
If Nanette Vlasik is walking out of there with money in her hand...<eos> It could mean she was on the take.<eos> It could mean more than that.<eos> Our suspect pool isn't just a bunch of people playing a game anymore.<eos> It's the Jersey mob, too.<eos> Doesn't look good, does it?<eos> Chief Vlasik coming out of your place with an envelope like that?<eos> Could be a stack of napkins in there.<eos> You don't know.<eos> We don't.
They're starting to suspect the blast this morning was the work of a group of eco-terrorists.<eos> The hotel ballroom they bombed was hosting a symposium on how to maximize profits in a world of ecological deregulation.<eos> I missed the part where you explained what this has to do with me.<eos> Well, they presented my client with a warrant seeking to seize any and all data files pertaining to the listed groups, all of whom are suspected of trafficking in eco-terror.<eos> Okay.<eos> All of these groups make use of Heptex clouds.<eos> Every website they visit, every cell call they make, every text and e-mail they send is believed to have been recorded or catalogued on a Heptex server.<eos> How convenient.<eos> The FBI wants access to these servers.<eos> Of course they do.
So, what did you think was going to happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Is Amber Bowen at this address?<eos> Amber!<eos> Why, what do you want her for?<eos> Amber Bowen?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're arresting you on suspicion of inciting girls to prostitution.<eos> Doing what?
So, I'm here in the hope that you might have some relevant intelligence in relation to them.<eos> I... I've...got the car, so, um, if there are files, I can take 'em now.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> No, really.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I've been in here, sat in here, for years, and what you're demanding off me now I couldn't pay you lot to look at for years.<eos> And what, you swan in here off the street with your Prada handbag telling me to hand it over like you were asking to check me gas meter?<eos> I understand...<eos> Oh, no, you don't.
I... I've...got the car, so, um, if there are files, I can take 'em now.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> No, really.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I've been in here, sat in here, for years, and what you're demanding off me now I couldn't pay you lot to look at for years.<eos> And what, you swan in here off the street with your Prada handbag telling me to hand it over like you were asking to check me gas meter?<eos> I understand...<eos> Oh, no, you don't.<eos> You really, really don't.
Do whatever official thing it is you coppers have to do when you're after evidence.<eos> But don't rock up here after all these years, acting like you're the saviour of the family!<eos> Here's your little bunny.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Here he is.<eos> Holly... when you went to the police about Tariq and Daddy and those other men, the CPS made a decision not to prosecute.<eos> But now there's a new team of police working on the kind of crime you were a victim of.<eos> We want to reopen your case and bring these men to trial.<eos> So, you want me to help you?<eos> Yeah, we do.
I'm saying we didn't start it.<eos> What happened last night, that was retaliation.<eos> For what?<eos> My sister.<eos> Carmen.<eos> Yesterday, this box ends up outside the house of an attorney I know.<eos> He does real estate.<eos> Finds places for us to put our money.<eos> I didn't think anybody knew about him.<eos> But, obviously, SBK did.
If I am right, it's time for you to give her up.<eos> You say you know who murdered her.<eos> Maybe I have my boys here beat his name out of you, then we go and see how protective his custody really is.<eos> Or maybe you're smart enough to wait until he has no protection at all.<eos> If you help me, he goes to prison.<eos> No armored cars, no rotating hotel rooms, no security detail.<eos> He's just another convict.<eos> I'm guessing you know plenty of people behind bars who you could send to introduce themselves.<eos> And you don't have a problem with that.<eos> Not tonight, I don't.
She was a fighter, wasn't she, Tyus?<eos> The M.E. wasn't able to recover any DNA from Carmen's mouth-- you did a pretty good job pouring bleach in there.<eos> But only pretty good.<eos> There was still some in her throat.<eos> Could there be another explanation for your blood in her esophagus?<eos> Or maybe you'd like to prove to us that you don't have any bite marks anywhere.<eos> You are getting way ahead of yourselves.<eos> If you tested his DNA without a warrant, that is an unlawful search.<eos> You didn't have permission...<eos> We did, actually.
I'll go get the doctor. Hey!<eos> You give Calamity Jane to Nedley, OK?<eos> He is gonna pretend he doesn't want her, but he loves that damn cat.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I am so sorry, Waverly, for everything.<eos> I made a h... I made a huge mistake. No!<eos> Forget about the DNA results, OK?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
- I gotta pick up that mongrel cat of hers.<eos> Well, if you hate it that much, I'll take Calamity Jane.<eos> No, Randy Nedley's a man of his word.<eos> And I got her a new scratching post.<eos> Hey, hey. Ahh.<eos> Chin up.<eos> Officer Haught's the strongest deputy I've ever had.<eos> Look, I know that you two are, um... you're, uh... but, you know, procedure says I had to call Nicole's next of kin.<eos> But she doesn't speak to her parents.<eos> Neither did I.
Old Gramps out at the Hitchens place threatened us with a Blue Light Special, but I shot this off.<eos> Let's just say that he's got two bad ears now.<eos> Did you skim any of my payment from said shipment?<eos> No Boss!<eos> Please, not like Wayne.<eos> Who's that now?<eos> She's at it again.<eos> No, I told her no more.<eos> You know how stubborn she is.<eos> Well, that I certainly do.
Like the drugs I was cooking at the homestead?<eos> Yes, exactly! That is probably where they're projecting their simulation from.<eos> Dolls' life isn't the only one that's a lie.<eos> Those bastards.<eos> They're gonna pay for this.<eos> Do you know how to wire RDX?<eos> Can a Dothraki outride any knight in Westeros?<eos> What?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes I do.
In 1990, I was chief of the Sex Offense Division.<eos> I handled the TNT cases.<eos> Ones where you wouldn't want to be very open about the investigation until you had something solid.<eos> Assuming you ever got something solid.<eos> We've heard supposedly that 30 to a hundred people came forward in the Maskell case.<eos> Would you have yourself heard those statements?<eos> I don't remember the number.<eos> I know there were quite a few, but it's been a little while, and of course, at this point, I don't have files or anything.<eos> Um, the fact that we had a number of victims come forward was enough to make us look at the situation, but prosecutors have a very specific obligation in terms of their conduct.<eos> All lawyers do.
I was flooded with childhood memories.<eos> Like the time when my father came home very inebriated and he was yelling at my mother saying, "Do you wanna know why I drink?<eos> Because I killed a woman.<eos> We put her behind the shop."<eos> I used to beg my father before my father died and I would just ask him over and over and over again, and the only answer I could ever get from my father was,<eos> "Shar, just leave it alone.<eos> It's just one of those things, you should just leave it alone."<eos> He never said, "Oh, my God.<eos> You're so ridiculous. How... "<eos> He didn't do that.
I don't have the slightest idea.<eos> Do you remember why they visited you?<eos> My ex-wife.<eos> So, if she told... the police at some point that you came home covered in blood that night, is she telling the truth?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She said I did.<eos> Your first wife, is she an honest person?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Do you remember having blood on your shirt that night?<eos> You do?
For twenty years have I served you and God as the Archbishop to Targoviste Cathedral.<eos> Yet never before have I felt the love of God shine so upon this great city.<eos> A little more than one year ago, many of us suffered a vision during the God-willed punishment of a witch in our midst.<eos> The devil himself came to us and threatened us with doom in one year.<eos> And yet, here we are.<eos> The devil lied.<eos> Why should we be surprised?<eos> Do we not know the devil for a liar?<eos> Do we not know his works to be illusion?<eos> Of course we do.
I'm kidding.<eos> She's here.<eos> I, um...<eos> I had a dog for many, many years.<eos> And he was my best friend.<eos> And I was always talking to him.<eos> Whenever I was home, I was talking to him.<eos> And then he died, and I stopped talking to him.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Or does it?
It was a shadow."<eos> What I do, I feel like, is way crazier.<eos> I like to talk crazy right after sex.<eos> When things have calmed down a beat.<eos> Get right in his face, real quiet.<eos> "What do you think would happen if I went to the hospital and got a rape exam right now?<eos> Yeah, what do you think?<eos> You think they'd find your semen all over and inside me?<eos> 'Cause I do.<eos> Oh, I really do.
- So you want me to give you a handout out of guilt?<eos> - I don't want a handout. But you made me a promise you wouldn't ruin my reputation.<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> What you do is dangerous.<eos> - I want you to say you make promises you can't keep.<eos> And by the way, you wouldn't have sent that Rachel woman back to me if you didn't know<eos> - what I do is worth it.<eos> - Okay, first of all, I never sent anyone back to you.<eos> And second, whatever job you think you're suited for doesn't exist in my firm.<eos> - It does at Baker Simms and Walker Stein.
All options are on the table.<eos> We returned from London at 0700 hours this morning in possession of a rare crystal needed to reconstruct a new full-scale EmDrive.<eos> Which will propel a gravity tractor to the asteroid in time to divert it?<eos> It's a bold move, Harris.<eos> And done without my advice<eos> - or my authorization.<eos> - Sometimes, it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.<eos> You taught me that, sir.<eos> It's only better if you get results.<eos> And we did.
But... whatever Atlas is, it nearly got me killed, Liam.<eos> A car came out of nowhere and hit me head-on.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I met you that first night, I started out just looking for a big story.<eos> But now I'm really just looking for the truth.<eos> So... what was that bruise that Jillian saw on you?<eos> Well, you know, I... I already told you.<eos> I'm Darius's new head of security, so sometimes, - sometimes I get into scrapes. - Mm.<eos> I do. Sometimes I do.
Music, art, literature, dancing.<eos> Dancing?<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> You just don't strike me as the type, the romantic type.<eos> That's all.<eos> I happen to be quite romantic when the right woman comes along.<eos> Or even the wrong one, for that matter.<eos> I have your number.<eos> I do.
He made me go right back on the horse.<eos> We started doing heroin that afternoon.<eos> And we'd shoot it between our toes to keep our arms clear for racquetball.<eos> And then what did he do?<eos> He gave me the greatest gift that a writer can give an actor.<eos> He wrote a play for me to star in.<eos> Which brings us to tonight.<eos> You see, over the years, I've written several plays for Gil and I to perform...<eos> - George, you remember the first?<eos> - The first play we ever did?
You told me you were afraid that I was gonna become better friends with him than you, and that's what this is.<eos> - How dare you say that to me in front of Donna?<eos> I told you that in complete confidence.<eos> This isn't about my relationship with Alex.<eos> This is about your relationship with Alex and how you're afraid to stand up to him.<eos> - You want to run that by me again?<eos> - I just ran it by you.<eos> What you are doing is a mistake.<eos> - I don't think so, and Donna doesn't think so, which means...<eos> - Actually, Harvey, I do.
No, I've been at... at the... lecture.<eos> William, this is Maggie.<eos> She's got a fancy for my surgery skills.<eos> And this is, sorry, what's your name again, love?<eos> Rebecca.<eos> Oh, Becky.<eos> Girls, this is William, he's an alienist.<eos> You won't know what that means.<eos> Neither does he.<eos> No-one does.
I wanted you to know where to find me in case you desired to talk again.<eos> Yes. Dr. McCoy said he moved you to guest quarters.<eos> Better than being trapped in sickbay.<eos> Well... better for HIM, I'm certain.<eos> I had many questions.<eos> Would you like to come in?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I mean yes... but no if you're busy.<eos> But as for wanting to... yes.<eos> But of course no if you don't also, but... but if you do then yes I...
Mr. Grady, if this is some sort of end-around...<eos> Your Honor, if you'll look at the file, you can see it was delivered to me yesterday.<eos> So, unless opposing counsel feels the U.S. Attorney was fabricating that date, that file is admissible.<eos> Ms. Sterling, unless you have another reason as to why this case shouldn't move forward, I'm inclined to allow it.<eos> I have a compelling reason, Your Honor.<eos> - And who are you?<eos> - My name is Alex Williams.<eos> Your Honor, this man has no standing in this case.<eos> I beg to differ, because I have a binding agreement signed by his legal clinic stating they would have no outside help from Pearson Specter Litt<eos> - on this case, yet they did.
No.<eos> She asked, and I said no.<eos> 'Cause I'm awesome.<eos> Come on, please, please, I don't want to be late.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Don't let him get too much sun, okay?<eos> - It's all right.<eos> - You have sunscreen, yes?<eos> - No, we don't.
A lawyer can't do anything.<eos> I did what I did.<eos> Mason...<eos> Whatever you have to do now, because of what happened, I won't blame you.<eos> Because you're gonna have to move on.<eos> And this is not your fault.<eos> You were such a good husband to me.<eos> I never thought that I would have a normal life, and I did.<eos> - Cora...<eos> - I really did.
How come?<eos> Girls seem to like it when boys wear more than one type of shirt.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I guess to get a sense of your style.<eos> It says something about a person.<eos> Like how some iguanas flare their colorful dewlaps to attract a mate.<eos> Exactly... like that.<eos> I think.<eos> How do you currently pick out your clothes?<eos> I don't.
No, sweetie.<eos> I'll be back in two shakes.<eos> Let's get rid of this Mr. Rogers shit your mom picked out.<eos> Party shirts first, bro.<eos> Hi. Excuse me... Dolores.<eos> My name is Elsa Gardner.<eos> I think I spoke to you on the phone earlier.<eos> I remember.<eos> You told me I have a beautiful speaking voice.<eos> You do.
She called you Belmont.<eos> House of Belmont?<eos> Trevor Belmont. Last son of the house of Belmont.<eos> The Belmonts fought creatures of the night, did they not? For generations.<eos> Say what you mean.<eos> The Belmonts killed vampires.<eos> Until the good people decided they didn't want us around.<eos> And now Dracula is carrying out an execution order on the human race.<eos> Do you care, Belmont?<eos> Honestly, I didn't, no.
I remember now.<eos> You're not with that guy today?<eos> Excuse me, but if you want to talk, could you please sit down?<eos> Then, I will.<eos> Why do you write novels, Mr. Hanaki?<eos> Simply put, it is my mission.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't think people had a mission.<eos> I don't think everyone has one.<eos> But, like me and yourself, Nanaka, some humans do.
There's no need to apologize.<eos> You're right.<eos> Well...<eos> What was the question again?<eos> When you heard you received the prize...<eos> You're the editor for Shin Michima, aren't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, you're here, Mr. Moriguchi.<eos> What underhanded method did you use?<eos> I didn't do anything.
I told them the truth.<eos> But, I couldn't answer any of their questions.<eos> DRIFTING EMOTIONS BY SHIN MICHIMA<eos> "The true atonement..."<eos> THE TRUE ATONEMENT BEGINS NOW.<eos> Throw these things away.<eos> It was sent by the guy who killed Nanaka.<eos> I asked the police about that.<eos> They said he didn't send any fax.<eos> Then who did?
You can have it back.<eos> That's Minami's.<eos> It's quite a tragedy that two people have died in the same house.<eos> I hate to do this now, Mr. Michima, but I have a few questions for you.<eos> What kind of work did Ms. Shirakawa do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you know anything about her family?<eos> I know nothing about them either.<eos> When Ms. Shirakawa was 20, her parents went missing. Did you know about that?<eos> You didn't?
Midori.<eos> See you later.<eos> Midori.<eos> Live your life.<eos> I will.<eos> Minami,<eos> I will never<eos> forget this feeling.<eos> -It looks like he's smiling.<eos> -It sure does.
But why protect me?<eos> At first, because I was your fan.<eos> But... then I fell in love with you.<eos> You fell in love?<eos> But, why me?<eos> Do I need a reason to fall in love?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hug me tight.<eos> Why are you doing this, Hitomi?<eos> Just do it.
She can pierce whatever you want for half price, except scrotes.<eos> I don't want her handling some other dude's dangle-downs, know what I'm saying?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, my goodness, that was fun.<eos> Casey, you need to write that nice boy that interviewed you a thank you e-mail.<eos> No, that is super nerdy.<eos> Yeah, well, nerdy's good.<eos> Nerds get full scholarships.<eos> You want to go there, right?<eos> - Um... - [Doug] Yeah, you do.
For as long as I can remember, it has been my ambition to become an Olympian.<eos> What?<eos> Olympics.<eos> Britain doesn't have a ski-jumping team so I was thinking...<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I know you're crazy.<eos> I know we didn't get off to the best of starts... but you shouldn't be fixing rust-buckets.<eos> Classic 1972 Trans-Am.<eos> If I had your pedigree and experience...<eos> Yeah, well you don't.
My boy.<eos> They hung three deserters down in Perry.<eos> Didn't put 'em back in the army.<eos> Just hung 'em.<eos> Yeah, I got a leave.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> His mama deserves to see her son again.<eos> She don't deserve to see him like that.<eos> No.<eos> No, she don't.
Well, he's askin' if I'd kill a man for some corn.<eos> I don't know.<eos> See, lieutenant, you steal our corn, we got nothin' to feed the hogs.<eos> If we can't feed the hogs, we got nothin' to put in the smokehouse.<eos> We got nothin' to put in the smokehouse, we starve in the winter.<eos> That's murder, ain't it?<eos> You know what the penalty for murder is, don't you, lieutenant?<eos> Yeah. Hmm?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I'm giving you a direct order.<eos> The Vanquisher has been eliminated, Bob.<eos> I've known about the elimination for two years, Claire.<eos> You don't have to do the same dirty work this time.<eos> The man inside is the lead terrorist.<eos> Terrorist!<eos> God!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Who knows how to get the scum of the earth to fuck off and go to hell? .<eos> We do, Claire.

Do you like Ben Folds?<eos> 'Cause I have a couple of tickets to his concert this week and the girl I was gonna go with, not a girlfriend or anything, she can't make it, she has a thing.<eos> I was wondering if maybe you'd wanna... - go?<eos> - I'm sorry, I can't.<eos> I don't like going to shows by myself, it feels kind of strange, so maybe...<eos> Not a big deal, no pressure.<eos> We could just go.<eos> It wouldn't have to be a date or anything.<eos> The thing is, I already sort of have a boyfriend, so...<eos> No, you don't.
- What?<eos> We put it in the break room.<eos> Okay.<eos> Lucky, bitch.<eos> Spill. Who's the guy?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Listen, I'm so sorry for the drunk dial the other night.<eos> I mean, you know how it is.<eos> Yeah, I do.
My hands.<eos> It's not about your hands.<eos> How is this not about my hands?<eos> Master Hamir.<eos> Thank you, Master Hamir.<eos> You cannot beat a river into submission.<eos> You have to surrender to its current... and use its power as your own.<eos> I control it by surrendering control?<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Not everything does.
Ringman!<eos> You're travelling light.<eos> - Where's the rest of it?<eos> - Coming by road.<eos> - Hello, Mr Jackson.<eos> - Hello, Mr Jackson.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who wants to ride in the back of the truck?<eos> - Me!<eos> I do!
I was born to be a Ghostbuster, all right?<eos> Nothing's gonna stop me!<eos> - Man.<eos> - Kevin!<eos> Come on, Rowan, get out of him!<eos> Thanks for the upgrade.<eos> Rowan, ya big bully!<eos> Hope this guy knows how to ride a motorcycle.<eos> Rowan, not Kevin!<eos> Yeah, he does.
Ask me nicely, Alan. No.<eos> I'm not gonna ask you nicely.<eos> Play with her.<eos> Do it.<eos> Fine.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Now look at me.<eos> Both... both of you.<eos> - I think I know what you want.<eos> - No, you don't.
Play with her.<eos> Do it.<eos> Fine.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Now look at me.<eos> Both... both of you.<eos> - I think I know what you want.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
Yeah.<eos> But, uh...<eos> From... What... - Glass?<eos> - Wow!<eos> You're a piece of work.<eos> Glass.<eos> Okay, MacGyver, no woman's gotten this far, but, um...<eos> You had a plumber cut your water?<eos> No.<eos> I did it myself.
Now, you drive careful.<eos> Right.<eos> So, Tijuana.<eos> Any sod-eyed muppet with a bloody backpack and a pair of frickin' Birkenstocks is gonna go on about that donkey show, man.<eos> Listen, listen, boys.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> The place I'm gonna take you gentlemen... listen to me now...<eos> it's downright naughty. Whoo!<eos> We know what you're talkin' about.<eos> No, you don't, Dave.
I understand...<eos> No, you don't understand what's goin' on with us!<eos> With who?<eos> With me and Donnie.<eos> I like it. You like what?<eos> It.<eos> When he... hurts me.<eos> Oh. I like it. No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Yes, I do.
Whatever.<eos> Flying is a lot harder than floating.<eos> Okay. You're right.<eos> Besides, haven't you ever wanted to do something extraordinary?<eos> But you'll be alone out there.<eos> Doesn't that scare you?<eos> I've been alone most of my life.<eos> Does being alone scare you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Come on, have a beer. We got, uh...<eos> I do not want that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, I'm Travis.<eos> And the rug there, that's Moby.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And, um...<eos> I think this is the point in the conversation where you tell me your name.<eos> Oh, you do, do you?
And, uh...<eos> I don't know. I wanted to show it to you.<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> This is my favorite part.<eos> Look.<eos> From me to you, Gabby.<eos> The stars and the moon.<eos> Let's just stay here forever.<eos> I'm glad you like it. Yeah.<eos> I do.
- Do you want your keys?<eos> - I'm driving.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We're looking for the Burbank Apartments.<eos> Oh, they're gone.<eos> Tore them babies down, um, going on about two years now.<eos> To the airport, then?<eos> Well, they used to have an overflight curfew.<eos> It's all right. It's all right. It's okay.<eos> - They did.
You just shot at us.<eos> I think it matters.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I made a film.<eos> I made a film with Dean, my boyfriend.<eos> And the idea was that we were gonna, you know, like make this experimental film, like an artistic film.<eos> - Porno film.<eos> -It's not a porno.<eos> Look, do you even know who my mother is?<eos> Yes, we do.
Well?<eos> I don't know, maybe I'm making things up, but on the day when Katya went missing, there was a van driving around here.<eos> What kind of van?<eos> I couldn't see the brand and the color.<eos> It was dark.<eos> I wanted to come closer and look, but it speeded right from that spot and disappeared.<eos> Do you remember the license plate number?<eos> No. But it had C class tires.<eos> So you didn't see either the license plate number or the brand but made out the tires?<eos> I didn't.
- Well, Deputy Everett.<eos> You fellas excuse me, I got a legal matter in which to attend.<eos> Care for one of these fine Maduros, Ray?<eos> Just had them flown in from Honduras this morning.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> - Suit yourself.<eos> Sit down.<eos> - We got a lot going on, so if we could just speed this along.<eos> - So, then you don't want your money then.<eos> - Yes, I do.
He tried to break into our cabin, and we had no choice, but to get rough with him - and we didn't know what to do... - Stop talkin'.<eos> Yes.<eos> Look, man, I already told you, makin' a report.<eos> That guy's not gonna come back and bother you.<eos> I'll bet you scared him off pretty good, huh?<eos> Besides...<eos> I won't let him ruin the fun.<eos> Thanks 'cause... my friend's inside and she's pretty upset about the whole thing.<eos> She wants to go home.<eos> We all do.
Ah!<eos> Shit!<eos> Are you okay man?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Yeah man I'm fine.<eos> Listen, can you just get me out of here?<eos> This isn't even my car man.<eos> So you got like no idea why these guys are chasing you?<eos> No.<eos> No I don't.
Ethan you're gonna have to excuse me, I got a real important massage appointment<eos> I can't miss.<eos> It's just that it's difficult for me to relax.<eos> I've been trying to go easier lately, but for a man in my position it's, it's just impossible.<eos> Yeah he pays the bills.<eos> I know you work for Syndicate Red.<eos> What did you just fuck'n say?<eos> I know you work for Syndicate Red.<eos> Look I don't have to wait 10 minutes to kill you, how did you know that?<eos> I just do.
Left her abandoned and penniless.<eos> Hooper!<eos> Holmes.<eos> For the record, Holmes, she didn't have me fooled.<eos> Why do you never mention me, sir?<eos> Emelia thought that she'd found happiness with Ricoletti, but he was a brute too.<eos> Emelia Ricoletti was our friend.<eos> You have no idea how that bastard treated her.<eos> But the Bride, Holmes, we saw her.<eos> Yes, Watson, we did.
Hye-sun.<eos> Hye-sun!<eos> Listen, you keep saying you want to go home.<eos> After you took off, I went to your place to collect.<eos> Your dad was really sick.<eos> Do you know what I told him?<eos> That you took my money and left, so he should pay back his kid's debt instead.<eos> Then he asked me for just a week.<eos> He said he needed a week.<eos> So what do I do?
Like... it's not good.<eos> I've always been tempted, in the back of my mind, to make music that would satisfy some of the creative desires within me.<eos> Or, like, put me in a place where I could be applauded by people I want to be applauded by.<eos> But I-I just can't do it.<eos> I think if we started to just try and make it about ourselves I think it would trip over pretty fast.<eos> 'Cause I don't think we're that good, truthfully.<eos> Part of this whole process is all about some kind of a moment of untouchable, unexplainable, spiritual something.<eos> For us, it's just such a process of, like, scratching and digging and, like... it's like, uh, like just puzzle pieces, you know?<eos> But we don't know what the picture looks like.<eos> And only God does.
If we get to that place, then we've done our job.<eos> It's not in our hands anyway.<eos> It was never, to begin with.<eos> Uh, see how this feels.<eos> I could never get tired of it.<eos> It's really... it's really awesome.<eos> There's always that.<eos> The chords, whoa...<eos> Yeah, it's a weird... it's one of those weird accidents.<eos> - You did a great accident.
How can you take advantage of someone's innocence?<eos> Advantage?<eos> I took advantage of you?<eos> Were you not hinting at me with your doe like eyes?<eos> What else could I do?<eos> I was looking at you with anger!<eos> I made a mistake, your eyes are very mischievous.<eos> They want one thing, but they say something else.<eos> Do you now understand how it feels when someone takes advantage of you?<eos> No, I did not.
- I'm not taking...<eos> God, you don't know anything, do you?<eos> I mean, you wrote the bloody book, and now you're coming over here all sanctimonious.<eos> I kept my end of the bargain.<eos> You keep yours.<eos> Go back to your pub and let me make something of my life.<eos> But that's just it.<eos> Do you really want this kind of life?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Brahms is very excited to meet you, miss Evans.<eos> He's never met an American before.<eos> I'm very excited to meet him, too.<eos> I, um...<eos> I was sure I left my shoes right here.<eos> They'll turn up.<eos> It's brahms.<eos> He can be playful.<eos> I assume you brought other shoes.<eos> Yes, I did.
And...<eos> Then one day, he went off again... And my sister took me to the hospital.<eos> But I knew before i even got there that I had lost the baby.<eos> What I'm trying to say is I...<eos> I know what it feels like to lose a child.<eos> Just like the heelshires.<eos> And that ties me to them.<eos> And to brahms. And to this place.<eos> Does that make any sense to you?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it does.
- Ninety-eight miles an hour.<eos> Wow, you must think you're pretty astonishing.<eos> - You can tell me. It's all right.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Well, come on, you can tell me.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> It will be our secret.<eos> You think you're pretty astonishing, right?<eos> No, sir.<eos> - You do.
- He doesn't like pills, huh?<eos> - No.<eos> - You still like him, though?<eos> - He's all right.<eos> - Those fucking parasites.<eos> - What did they get my dad on?<eos> Drug smuggling.<eos> - It's pretty serious.<eos> - So did we lose any endorsements?<eos> No, you did not.
That's all she cared about.<eos> You know, but she was...<eos> she was super pretty.<eos> She'd do those tumbles into jumps, you know.<eos> Stellar shit.<eos> She led her whole team to this competition in, uh, Tokyo, Japan. Did you know that?<eos> - Your mom competed in Japan.<eos> - No.<eos> - You didn't know that?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Come on.<eos> Well, say something.<eos> What do you think'?<eos> This is so strange.<eos> I know.<eos> Aw, I want to see the silly dance.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're gonna have a better life now.<eos> We already do.
Okay, but only if we can get you to a doctor first.<eos> No, I feel fine.<eos> No excuses, we're going.<eos> I probably just had low blood sugar.<eos> It happens to people all the time, I searched it.<eos> We're going, get dressed.<eos> Get out of my room.<eos> You're never around when I need you.<eos> Your sister just passed out in the backyard and you couldn't care less.<eos> - She did?
The way we left things was...<eos> - Was it?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> I see.<eos> You know, sometimes...<eos> I know, but it's hard because...<eos> I get it.<eos> I've been there.<eos> Thanks, Lieutenant, you always know what to...<eos> I do.
- You will never...<eos> - Shut the fuck up.<eos> You don't get to talk.<eos> - Don't even think about it.<eos> - We've been here before.<eos> Andreas?<eos> Just tell me where she is.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - You think I'm playing?<eos> - No, I don't.
I can't...<eos> We agreed to find you, like, an actual professional.<eos> Yeah, but wouldn't it be better if this one simple thing saved me, instead of, I don't know, 12 years of therapy?<eos> I mean, I'm in LA and I can't even drive a car.<eos> Well, that's different. Not everyone lost their father to these freeways.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I was 3. You'd think by now, I'd be able to ride more than a bike.<eos> You actually think you're going to find something?<eos> Look at you.<eos> You do, don't you?
Okay?<eos> Ruthie?<eos> Don't trust these people.<eos> Especially Pam.<eos> Pam's just mad at you.<eos> She's nice.<eos> She?<eos> The nice ones always end up being the biggest assholes.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Uh, yes I do.
That's why you get 200,000 people surrendering to 60,000.<eos> That's the difference.<eos> Now, the thing is, politicians, they don't understand tactics.<eos> And soldiers, they don't understand strategy.<eos> But Caesar, he understood both.<eos> Julius Caesar in the corner.<eos> He's read it all.<eos> He knows every battle ever fought.<eos> - Does he know about the real thing?<eos> - None of us do.
Hey, leave her alone, gomer.<eos> Here you go, brother.<eos> Keep the change.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> What's going on here, boys?<eos> Why don't you mind your own damn business?<eos> They are my business.<eos> These rednecks were trying to take the girls out back.<eos> - Your friend's got a big mouth.<eos> - Yeah, he does.
- There you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> To the rest of our lives.<eos> Together.<eos> I love you, John.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I guess they found nature.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Yes, they did.
The American Museum of Natural History.<eos> I've always wanted to come here.<eos> Quit screwing around, Donnie.<eos> Thirty seconds till the cops are at the door.<eos> Donnie...<eos> Shredder and the mutants were definitely here.<eos> And I'm detecting traces of neutronium, the critical ingredient required for creating a controlled black hole.<eos> Which is the only thing capable of rupturing the space-time continuum.<eos> And you know what that means!<eos> No. I don't, Donnie.
Have a great afternoon.<eos> I finished the online problems for the entire semester three weeks ago.<eos> All right, apple, then I wasn't talking to you.<eos> How about the, uh, the readings?<eos> You need any help with those?<eos> My parents published the books.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> You are Mccreighton-hill. The girl who got into Greene because of her parents.<eos> But you know what? I, uh, I don't buy that.<eos> Everyone else does.
At first I wasn't sure about this sweater.<eos> And then I was, like, how could I live without this sweater?<eos> Uh, I was referring to the length.<eos> You missed practice again.<eos> The meet is this weekend.<eos> - Yeah...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> About that.<eos> You know how everyone told me it was a stupid idea to build a gymnastics team to win back a boy?<eos> - Well, I didn't.
Yes.<eos> - Did not you say?<eos> - Do not.<eos> How will penises smell pussy, old man?<eos> The "tool" needed to transmit signals.<eos> You're damn bright, old.<eos> - The bloody sweat.<eos> - You said it.<eos> Hey, tell me ...<eos> What does a blonde after a blowjob?
It's been forever.<eos> I would love that.<eos> - Me too.<eos> - I'll, um...<eos> - I'll see you on the panel.<eos> - Yeah. See you up there.<eos> I'm wondering, for each of you, what's that thing that really makes you... want to get up in the morning?<eos> Well, for me, I guess, the simplest answer is...<eos> I like money.<eos> I do.
Did you get in okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need to talk about that e-mail.<eos> - Do you ever relax?<eos> - Heh.<eos> - Have a drink.<eos> - I'd love to.<eos> But there are a million things going on tomorrow.<eos> - And...<eos> - This place does an amazing martini.
He's still wearing it, and will continue to unless he testifies, then he takes it off.<eos> He forfeits it the minute he goes up there. No, he doesn't.<eos> To the jury he does.<eos> He gets in that box, they'll expect him to prove his innocence.<eos> Any everything else we've presented goes out the window.<eos> You mean everything I've presented.<eos> You're killing me, and that's fine, but don't kill him.<eos> Go home and write and your closing argument.<eos> You think you can handle it?<eos> - Do you?
No.<eos> How many times have you had sex, with women or men?<eos> Once before, with a girl.<eos> Only once before?<eos> And you don't remember anything about this second time?<eos> There were a lot of drugs.<eos> Oh, we've heard.<eos> A lot of foreplay, too?<eos> No. She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't.
And keep doing it?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> You are, aren't you?<eos> We got another connection.<eos> Friend of yours and my last job before this fucking retirement.<eos> Andrea.<eos> Tragic death.<eos> Nice girl by all accounts.<eos> I mean, she had her personal problems, but who doesn't?<eos> You do.
What happened out there?<eos> What happened to the trick?<eos> Conner, don't worry.<eos> Nobody saw anything.<eos> I wish they had seen something.<eos> Now, there's 10,000 people that think I got no dick.<eos> Wait.<eos> You guys know I have a dick, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You do. You do.
What?<eos> Gotta coordinate with cpd.<eos> Cops hates feds, you're the newest.<eos> Least amount of hate.<eos> Don't take any shit from those assholes.<eos> Thanks for meeting me.<eos> I felt bad for never giving you anything at west Chester.<eos> Do you think this is political?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Apparently you do.
No, stop!<eos> The fuck is wrong with you?<eos> !<eos> Trying to take a chopper off in the middle of downtown, are you fucking crazy?<eos> !<eos> You motherfucker!<eos> Hubert got away!<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
Yeah.<eos> Just tell me when you wanna stop.<eos> You know what?<eos> Honestly, Lizzy, I'm done, okay?<eos> Just get in the goddamn car!<eos> - I don't want to!<eos> - I don't care!<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> - Look, I know this is a big night for you. - I don't care!<eos> - Yes, you do!
James Holden.<eos> Shit just follow you around, don't it kid?<eos> Are you a cop?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Hey, thanks for the assist.<eos> Now who the hell are you?<eos> Anybody else know you were coming here?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> They do now.
We can't just charge in and start shooting.<eos> Pretty sure we can.<eos> Hey, keep your hands off these people.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> - Following orders.<eos> - That's Miller's pal.<eos> Yeah, I didn't get any orders anything like this.<eos> You stand down.<eos> I've got rank here.<eos> Not today, you don't.
- You think she's headed for a breakdown? - No.<eos> I mean, she's in a vulnerable state.<eos> Yeah, but is she, like, breakdown material?<eos> I can't see how she can stand this kind of pressure much longer, if that's what you mean.<eos> I'd like to hear what you know about Louis' fall, the version Natalie told you.<eos> Uh, why?<eos> I thought that since you had a certain... friendship with her, that you might have some insight that would help us.<eos> I don't think I do.<eos> Did you know that Peter Drax isn't Louis' biological father?<eos> I did.
I did.<eos> I see we're all ready to go.<eos> Murtagh, please try not to insult too many people tonight.<eos> Are you... mad, woman?<eos> I can see every inch of you, right down to your third rib.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> Christ.<eos> I can see right down to your navel.<eos> Surely you don't mean to go out in public like this.<eos> I most certainly do.
So, you guys are in this cabin.<eos> And that one is Todd and Margie's.<eos> You know, I forgot my satchel back in the house, I'll be right back.<eos> Did he just say "satchel"?<eos> Unfortunately, yes.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> My god.<eos> Look, they're so cute.<eos> Oh! I want to hold them close to my face.<eos> No, you do not.
Last time she had an attack, you lost yourself in your work.<eos> Afterwards, I had to save your ass, and I refuse to do it again!<eos> - I can get you leave.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> Then you can work reduced hours.<eos> Everyone will understand, Mads.<eos> - Hi, Mom!<eos> - Hi, sweetie. All right?<eos> - Yes. Did you buy sushi?<eos> - Of course I did.
What can I do about it?<eos> You could help me.<eos> Will you help me stop them?<eos> - Who was that?<eos> - Just a colleague.<eos> - Now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Honey, I... I'm not taking leave.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Did you?
Isabel!<eos> We're leaving.<eos> Why?<eos> Seriously?<eos> I'm not playing, come on.<eos> We gotta go, we gotta go.<eos> Manuel...<eos> Manuel...<eos> Rocky!<eos> How you doing, brother?
I don't know what You're talking about.<eos> I couldn't figure it out either, I'm like, you know...<eos> You know, what type of connection could you have to this, you know?<eos> Connection?<eos> Black, I have no connection with no cops, man.<eos> You know, I'm just...<eos> I'm just out here, you know,<eos> I'm always hustling...<eos> - Well...<eos> - I don't...
Yeah.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Get off.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Better.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You sound better.<eos> So, did you guys actually use the fishing tackle?<eos> Yeah, we really did.
Hey, Uncle Lee.<eos> Is it okay if Silvie sleeps over?<eos> Dad always let her.<eos> Then what are you asking me for?<eos> No reason.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, not that it would come up or anything, but her parents think she stays downstairs when she stays over.<eos> If it comes up for some reason, can you just say she stayed in the downstairs room?<eos> I don't even know them.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Don't ask me why, but if you want make some other arrangements, you want to find someplace else to bury him, you want to talk to the mortician, and you want to call up Sacred Heart and talk to Father Martin and then find out how much that's going to cost and make all those arrangements, be my guest, otherwise, let's just leave it, okay?<eos> I'm just saying I don't like him being in a freezer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't like it, either, but it isn't him 'cause he's gone.<eos> It's just his body.<eos> I'm just saying it kind of freaks me out.<eos> Oh, goddammit, where did I park the car?<eos> Yeah, I don't know, but I wish you'd figure it out 'cause I'm freezing my ass off.<eos> You don't have a normal winter coat?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Forget it.<eos> Skip it. I can't hear a goddamn word you're saying.<eos> What?<eos> Did Lee gel' food?<eos> He didn't...<eos> What? Did Lee get food?<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't want any.<eos> We're good. Forget it.<eos> He doesn't...
All right, I'm calmer now.<eos> Would you please just go away?<eos> No.<eos> Cool.<eos> How much are they paying you?<eos> Minimum wage plus the room.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go get some furniture.<eos> I got furniture.<eos> No, you don't.
We hire it out till we pay the loan back, obviously.<eos> Unfortunately for you, I'm in charge of your finances until you turn 21, and I'm not comfortable taking out enormous loans on your behalf.<eos> Can you drive me home to get my stuff, and then drive me over to Sandy's house?<eos> Sure.<eos> Why don't you take a Drivers' Ed course?<eos> Dad made me promise not to drive till I was 17.<eos> Okay, we'll stick with that then.<eos> Do you want to stay for dinner?<eos> I think Sandy's mother likes you.<eos> No, she doesn't.
W-what do I talk about?<eos> Just, you know, whatever comes naturally.<eos> Hello.<eos> I don't know why, but I have this sudden urge to put my mouth on your mouth.<eos> Okay, that's called kissing, but you can't do that yet.<eos> That's too fast.<eos> How 'bout if I put my penis in you?<eos> - That's even worse.<eos> - Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> What about if I just did the tip, like, just the very beginning—
You know, she smelled like Don Julio... and bad choices?<eos> She always does this to me, too.<eos> She just... she just disappears.<eos> She's like the fantasmo,no?<eos> You know, you know fantasmo?<eos> The whole reason I planned to come on this trip, con "A,"<eos> was to find the secret beach.<eos> And now she's just stuck back at Las Rocas with the Irish flu.<eos> You don't like it when someone change your plans, do you?<eos> No, I don't. No, I don't.
The niggers in there would go off about 'em, right?<eos> Little Romeo and little this and that, right?<eos> But I didn't know who Taylor Swift was.<eos> Who the fuck is she?<eos> - I never heard of that bitch ever.<eos> - The fuck do you know, man?<eos> You didn't even know we invaded Egypt.<eos> - Iraq.<eos> - Same fuckin' thing.<eos> Goddamn right I didn't.
Don't go anywhere.<eos> This guy's not gonna stop until I have an Emmy, a Peabody, and a Pulitzer.<eos> Let's do some reporting. - How could this happen?<eos> - We had only static from the moment Agent Porter entered the club.<eos> He said Sikes used a jamming device.<eos> It would have to be one hell of a jammer.<eos> The static I heard sounded a lot more like Agent Porter simply turned off his wire.<eos> Porter turning off his wire?<eos> That doesn't make any sense, Captain.<eos> - No, no, it doesn't.
Rose?<eos> Here!<eos> There we go.<eos> Craig was right.<eos> I should have done more.<eos> I should have tried.<eos> You did... nothing wrong.<eos> No.<eos> He deserves to know the truth.<eos> You both do.
Seyid Mustafa brought me.<eos> I've missed you so much.<eos> Seyid.<eos> Go fetch the mullah and tell him I need to get married immediately.<eos> We don't need a mullah.<eos> I know how to conduct a marriage.<eos> I just need to prepare the papers.<eos> Good. In an hour's time, then.<eos> You really want to do this?<eos> Do you?
But you have another responsibility as the key to the project.<eos> You get to decide whether or not humanity will ever have a chance to benefit from it.<eos> Were they part of humanity?<eos> Maybe not to you people.<eos> Maybe they're out-of-date humanity, or second-rate humanity.<eos> You know, I don't believe you.<eos> I don't believe you ever really cared about their pain.<eos> Do you care?<eos> Do you really care about my pain?<eos> Of course, I do!
I should save you from your misery of being you.<eos> While I'm at it, I should definitely take this.<eos> Please keep crying.<eos> I can't tell you what it does to me.<eos> You have deserved this for a long time.<eos> You're totally right, I deserve this.<eos> I deserve this.<eos> I deserve this, please do it.<eos> Please do it.<eos> Just do it!
Go.<eos> Chief, find a bedroom.<eos> I got it from here.<eos> All right, Leo.<eos> Boys. Why don't you take a break?<eos> Go watch some TV, huh?<eos> It's gonna be a long night.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm coming outside, boys.<eos> How ya doing out there, Bobby?
Bishop!<eos> I'm unarmed.<eos> How well do you know this Dante?<eos> Not well.<eos> So keep your eye on him.<eos> Our boy is gonna get himself killed.<eos> I'm unarmed.<eos> You know this lunatic, Dante?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
YOU GO FIRST.<eos> A JUGGLING KIT?<eos> YOU BRAT.<eos> "BUILDING YOUR DREAM HOUSE."<eos> THIS IS, UH, SO GROWN UP OF YOU.<eos> I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING SILLY.<eos> MERRY CHRISTMAS.<eos> MERRY CHRISTMAS.<eos> WHEN YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR HEARTBREAK AND I PRETENDED LIKE I DIDN'T HAVE ONE?<eos> WELL, I DID.
I shouldn't. I'm covered up with work.<eos> I might count on you changing your mind.<eos> It'd mean a lot to me.<eos> Shouldn't have to celebrate alone.<eos> Just a drink.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Good.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> You have anymore commitments this afternoon?<eos> Actually, no, I don't.
You get to have your fun, and Dave feels stupid.<eos> And that's that.<eos> - Dropping the mic, what does that mean?<eos> - You drop it.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> - Come on, oh my god.<eos> - What, you, just...<eos> - it's game time.<eos> - I don't have a choice, do I?<eos> - Nope, no you don't.
It's like a ghost theatre.<eos> Ghost people watching ghost movies.<eos> - Everything has its time.<eos> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.<eos> That's my lucky number.<eos> - It's not where you sit but who you sit next to.<eos> I remember that first summer.<eos> I wanted to see the big lebowski but you insisted on seeing buffalo 66.<eos> - You told me you loved that movie.<eos> - I did.
- It's Henry's, he thought he was getting laid tonight.<eos> He's not here.<eos> - Well, what if he comes back, doesn't he have a key?<eos> - He's still at the party, the guy's on a mission.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - I like what you did with the place.<eos> - I just expected the end of the night to go a lot different than this.<eos> - The rose petals are a little dramatic.<eos> - You like 'em.<eos> - I do.
They may be dead for all a girl knows.<eos> Tell me about the Hound.<eos> Also dead.<eos> Arya Stark left him to die.<eos> He was on her list.<eos> He was not on her list anymore.<eos> She had taken him off it.<eos> Why?<eos> Didn't she want him dead any longer?<eos> She did and she did not.
You don't want to use it, but if the other side knows you got it, they tend to come to the table sooner.<eos> And you can stop staring at my feet any time you want. I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, um, my father has the same condition,<eos> - not as bad, but, uh... - You know what I really resent?<eos> Attractive, young women telling me I remind them of their fathers.<eos> So, you want them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Cost me 500 bucks.<eos> I prefer a money order.<eos> Nice doing business with you.
You just...<eos> You know...<eos> You only get what you give.<eos> Am I supposed to sing back to you or something?<eos> I don't...<eos> Nick, I promise you.<eos> I promise that if you open up, you won't get hurt, okay?<eos> I just...<eos> I... I don't know what you want.<eos> No, you don't.
You've gotta tell Paul the... news.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I saw the artistic director after... And he mentioned this ABC show that's staffing... And he knows the show-runner.<eos> So I'm gonna send in a spec. That's great!<eos> You already have that one you can send.<eos> I mean, it needs a lot of work, but...<eos> Where's your dad?<eos> He's standing downstairs.<eos> Do you have any wine?<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, we do.
- I'm not.<eos> - I'm going home to Wales.<eos> - Really?<eos> There's nowhere suitable for her to live, Sister.<eos> She's been so poorly.<eos> Your daughter is welcome to lodge here with us.<eos> I think that's a most suitable suggestion.<eos> So do I.<eos> I don't know...<eos> I do.
I say, is this seat taken?<eos> You came.<eos> For the flamenco, that's all.<eos> Poor souls, falling through the cracks with no-one there to catch them.<eos> You're there, ain't ya?<eos> I'm just one man, Mrs Beckett.<eos> They need an army.<eos> A good man's an army by himself.<eos> He has your husband's smile.<eos> He does, doesn't he?
It might not... you know... happen.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's true, isn't it?<eos> And sometimes... if you have the money... there are things that you can, you know... do.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> You'd send me to some butcher in a back alley?<eos> No! Not like that, of course not.<eos> A proper doctor.<eos> I've heard that in Harley Street there are...<eos> You know...<eos> And do you?
Sister, this was the kinder way.<eos> We couldn't even tell whether it was male or female.<eos> May the Lord bless you and keep you.<eos> May he make his face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you, and grant you peace.<eos> I think it's gone.<eos> It hasn't been baptised.<eos> I should've baptised it myself.<eos> You don't have to be a priest to christen a baby, did you know that?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Yes.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Did she cry?<eos> A little.<eos> But when she took her last breath, she was warm and safe... .. and I believe she was aware she was loved.<eos> I wished so hard for her.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't have.<eos> Maybe I'm being punished.<eos> - But God knows I love my boys...<eos> - He does.
I hope Mr Hereward appreciates your dedication.<eos> I don't care if he doesn't.<eos> Enter.<eos> Barbara, may I speak to you for a moment?<eos> I expect it's time I did my vanishing act.<eos> Or as we say in Spanish class, "Le dejo a usted conversar, senoritas." I think we need to "conversar" about Cousin Mabel.<eos> There's no such person, Trixie.<eos> I made her up so that I didn't have to tell you the truth.<eos> But there's really no truth to tell now, so it doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
Daughter's drinking.<eos> You drank when you were 15.<eos> Little girls don't drink.<eos> Disneyland?<eos> How lucky are you guys?<eos> - What are you guys gonna ride?<eos> - Jumbo. Dumbo, not Jumbo.<eos> Dumbo. Em, did you thank Mommy?<eos> Say thank you?<eos> - Yes, we did.
Don't lie to me.<eos> You're a long way from fulton street.<eos> You followed me from there.<eos> Nobody know you're here except me.<eos> Wanna go down the alley? Huh?<eos> I will cut you up.<eos> And nobody will ever find you.<eos> Why you tailing me?<eos> Why are you tailing me?<eos> Okay, I did!
Just get it done.<eos> Goddamn, negro.<eos> You all right?<eos> What happened to you? You get hit by a bus?<eos> Swear jar.<eos> You cursed.<eos> Swear jar?<eos> Come on, man. I...<eos> All right, look, I don't have anything on me now.<eos> Yeah, you do.
What's there not to like?<eos> Zip and Amos picked up the truck from the docks right after I shot Scarfe.<eos> Domingo got his guns back last night.<eos> Everyone else will fall in line.<eos> Jamaicans, Haitians, Dominicans.<eos> Hell... even the Koreans.<eos> All loyal.<eos> We're all good.<eos> So... when do I get my Judas?<eos> You don't.
Do you think... they have rubber gloves in the kitchen?<eos> Next to the dishwashing station.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Look what Luke Cage did to your cousin.<eos> Nice sweatshirt. You box now?<eos> What I do is more like CrossFit.<eos> Always full of surprises.<eos> And I hate that.<eos> I don't know shit about you.<eos> Nobody does.
-No, no, no.<eos> That's not your shield.<eos> That shield belongs to the city of New York and its people.<eos> And when you lose control, go upside somebody's head because you had a bad day... or you feel powerless...<eos> -or you screw the wrong person--<eos> -I didn't screw anybody.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> You don't deserve to represent the people of New York, let alone protect them.<eos> That's not true and you know it.<eos> I do.
I need to get you stabilized.<eos> Then I'll think of some way to help Claire and everybody else up there.<eos> You can't negotiate with him.<eos> I won't.<eos> I don't wanna...<eos> I don't wanna bleed to death on the floor, like Scarfe.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> I think you deserve a drink, Councilman.<eos> - I don't drink.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Yeah.<eos> What number are you calling me from?<eos> A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS.<eos> I need to see you.<eos> - Come into the precinct. - No.<eos> No.<eos> You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.<eos> You didn't wanna talk to me before.<eos> What makes you trust me now?<eos> Because Luke Cage does.
There's food in there, too.<eos> You can't leave me in here!<eos> There's baby diapers in here, man!<eos> Come on!<eos> Looks like you downgraded.<eos> I liked the club better.<eos> I'm a man who needs his space.<eos> Space is a good thing.<eos> Especially when you come to kill a man.<eos> Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies.
And then this... this guy, Diamond Jim.<eos> Diamondback.<eos> Yes, Diamondback.<eos> Cornell said that he was his direct contact, whatever that means.<eos> And he was pissed off when those guns were stolen.<eos> You know, in that... that thing that your Detective Scarfe got caught up in?<eos> There were a lot of dirty hands.<eos> Not Cornell's.<eos> - He didn't have the guns.<eos> - Oh, yes, he did.
I'll have it bound for you.<eos> Then you have your little book.<eos> The book "Agnes".<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you hungry as well?<eos> Are you still not feeling better?<eos> No, I can't concentrate.<eos> I don't think I'll be well by New Year's Night.<eos> Don't you want us to go out?<eos> - I do.
Hi, it's me.<eos> Listen, I'm off to Ecuador to cover a pretty dangerous war.<eos> Um, we'll talk about everything when I get back. If I get back.<eos> It's cut out.<eos> Oh, it's the tunnel.<eos> Sorry, can you avoid the tunnels?<eos> Tickets.<eos> That's not the tickets, that's your letter.<eos> - I threw the letter away.<eos> - No, you didn't.
- No. And you made the playing video games, reading comics a bad thing, as well.<eos> - It's not what every woman likes in a man.<eos> - Good. Because I don't want...<eos> I don't like her to want me anymore. Because I don't want her anymore.<eos> As the world waits and worries about our two journalists in Ecuador, the whole station joins me in thinking of Ian Finch,<eos> - whose birthday it is today.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - This is Claire Maddox... - I'd forgotten.<eos> Claire remembered.<eos> She always does.
_ I'm bleeding!<eos> Yeah, just a moment.<eos> Where do you want me?<eos> You can sit on the chair there.<eos> You're the woman we met by the road earlier, right?<eos> Yes. That's right.<eos> _ Did you find it?<eos> _ Find what?<eos> _ The town you were looking for?<eos> _ Oh yeah, we did.
What good does that do me if I don't remember any of it?<eos> Whether you remember this or not, your father used to say that he was amazed by your abilities.<eos> He said you were capable of far more than he ever said.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> More?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But when the time comes, you'll know what to do.<eos> Have faith in yourself.<eos> I have faith in you.<eos> And so did your father.
Is it today?<eos> Promise me.<eos> We have plenty of time.<eos> 8:25.<eos> Where's Curda?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Valčík, you take this street behind me.<eos> We have some sun, so take this.<eos> If he approaches without an armed escort, then use it to signal.<eos> And if he does?
Nah, man! A white lady had it in her garage... - and never drove it.<eos> - Was it Driving Miss Daisy?<eos> What's that little bolt right there?<eos> - Which one?<eos> - Goddamn mouth.<eos> - What's with you, bro?<eos> - Talking about my shit ain't brand-new.<eos> - Man, you need counseling, bro.<eos> - You do, too.<eos> No, I don't. You do, man.
- You've been Googling my ass?<eos> You're not wanted here, Carl.<eos> We enjoy watching your kind on the football field... the basketball courts, and the boxing ring.<eos> But we pay for cable TV... to see you on our television... not to live in our neighborhood.<eos> Daddy, I'm scared.<eos> It's a matter of time... before your wife starts to braid hair... like Allen Iverson!<eos> Why does he still have the braids?<eos> We like Allen Iverson's braids.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We do.
- That's right.<eos> And I'm here for Carl Black.<eos> Your deadbeat dad has multiple cards under multiple names... buying iPads he can't afford.<eos> I see the Louboutin receipts!<eos> Well, can't he just take out a loan, or layaway--<eos> Too late for that. The bigwigs decided.<eos> I'm here to take the Black family off the books.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> - Yes, you do, little girl.
You are so much trouble, and I love trouble.<eos> You're a lot of trouble...<eos> God. God, help me.<eos> The dreaded tox reports.<eos> Alcohol, ketamine, MDMA in both, and amphetamine in him, not her.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> This has to be a mistake.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you don't like being lied to?<eos> I don't.
- Yeah.<eos> - Feel it.<eos> Isn't that fabric wonderful?<eos> Amazing.<eos> Aunt Poppy plans to spoil you rotten.<eos> These stores are expensive.<eos> Let me.<eos> I'll never have a child of my own.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
Sometimes, when you're drunk, you forget things.<eos> Can't you get new ones?<eos> Those are specialty tools.<eos> They're hard to find.<eos> They cost a lot of money.<eos> If Otto doesn't have some to borrow... I've got to find the son of a bitch who stole mine or I'm screwed.<eos> So we are going to Otto's.<eos> - Anthony.<eos> - Hey, Otto.<eos> - How you doing?
- No.<eos> - Do you believe that there was one?<eos> Why would my husband lie?<eos> I read everything you did.<eos> I know everything you made her do.<eos> I didn't touch her, Mr Redmond.<eos> Did you enjoy yourself?<eos> Did you enjoy taking her virginity?<eos> Did you enjoy making her a woman?<eos> - Did you?
She spoke to me in confidence.<eos> - About what?<eos> - I'm not gonna do that.<eos> I'm not you.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - You've broken confidences.<eos> - Only when I thought it necessary.<eos> - I can't break the rules like you do.<eos> - I don't break the rules!<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Come on, man. - Please, speech.<eos> - All right.<eos> Thank you, Brad.<eos> Well, I'm humbled by your devotion to celebrating my birthday. I mean...<eos> The other day Clyde was asking me why I insist on no gifts, and I said something about how we don't need any more stuff. Which is true.<eos> We don't need any more stuff, but...<eos> I think what I really meant is you don't need to give me anything because you're here. And that's a very good gift, I appreciate it.<eos> I mean, if you have, you know, an albino alligator, I'll take it.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> - We do.
You saw them?<eos> She had packets in the car.<eos> I think it was ecstasy.<eos> How did you know it was ecstasy?<eos> She was saving up to leave town.<eos> She was selling for someone.<eos> It would help us if you answered the question Miss Macy.<eos> How did you know it was ecstasy?<eos> Doctor.<eos> I didn't.
I used to look at you and think that that was the worst thing... the not knowing.<eos> - It is.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> I've got nothing now.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Least you've still got hope.<eos> - ♪ Over and over... ♪ - WENDY: Gillian, you have to go home<eos> - now.<eos> Anna has homework.<eos> - No, I don't.
Roy!<eos> Jesus, Max, calm down.<eos> Somebody knows.<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> My family was threatened, and now<eos> - my daughter's dead.<eos> - Come on, come inside.<eos> It must be someone who knows what's up there, what we've done.<eos> No one knows.<eos> Grayson does.
It's mine!<eos> It's mine!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Ah! I got it!<eos> I got it!<eos> I want it! Aah! It's the end of the line, Naté.<eos> I've seen a lot of drug-smuggling operations, but this one takes the cake.<eos> Think you can cuff her, partner?<eos> I do, partner.<eos> I do.

Well maybe you're next.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Is this what this all comes down to?<eos> Well, I hope you've rehearsed.<eos> That's cute.<eos> And for your information, yes, I have.<eos> I gotta say you were fairly impressive, but I mean, what else would we expect from the great Orson Creed?<eos> Am I right?<eos> Well I had some help, but you know all about that.<eos> Yes, you did.
I'll stand here.<eos> You can talk.<eos> OK.<eos> I want to be someone you can trust, Chloe.<eos> I don't know if I can do that.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Do you know what. - Happened to her?<eos> No.<eos> Not really.<eos> Nobody does.
Great.<eos> I'm not going in there.<eos> Fucking shoot me.<eos> This is it.<eos> This is what?<eos> I appreciate your enthusiasm but we need to think this through.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> Come here, you little fuck.<eos> Do you know where you go when you die?<eos> I do.
Besides, it ain't what the Heavenly Father wants for us.<eos> Come on now.<eos> Have some more of that chicken.<eos> Looks real good.<eos> Father disagreed with the Prophet on Thor Gundersen.<eos> Got him cast out.<eos> And us with him.<eos> I know.<eos> So, where'd you say you're headed?<eos> I didn't.
I think I've a notion of who you're wantin' for this.<eos> I've not seen my cousin anywhere since this whole thing started.<eos> Pains me to say it,<eos> but that's what I'm figurin'.<eos> Your own blood.<eos> He's killed Delaney.<eos> He'll kill Durant, too.<eos> We both know what he's capable of.<eos> You saw him take out a man's eye.<eos> I did.
- the famous Prudential Center. - What?<eos> - Yes. - It's so big.<eos> Now, this is very important.<eos> Fenway Park.<eos> That's a fire hydrant right there.<eos> Nothing famous about that.<eos> Now, this is the famous Beacon Hill.<eos> This is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the entire city, and it's home to my sweet, sweet boyfriend, Tom Brady.<eos> - Does he really live there?<eos> - Yeah, he does.
What made you think of that?<eos> I don't know, just popped in my head.<eos> I could never figure it out.<eos> Hey, you're a smart lady.<eos> Why were they laughing at me?<eos> They probably had crushes on you.<eos> I mean, everything's backwards when you're little.<eos> When a boy likes you, he pulls your hair.<eos> When you like a boy, you kick him in the shins.<eos> You do any shin-kicking back in the day?
Have you seen it?<eos> Who's seen it?<eos> What's the good word?<eos> You rioting yet?<eos> Hit the phones and let me know, and if you haven't checked it out yet, do the right thing and see it now!<eos> Dying to see this movie.<eos> Sounds interesting enough.<eos> Blick, Thompson, and Cohen were talking about it in the office.<eos> And Thompson said the film might be racist towards white people.<eos> No, he didn't.
We did everything together.<eos> Except the sexy stuff.<eos> Hmm. Now this is a real man you got yourself here.<eos> Just going right over there.<eos> Tommy, my man!<eos> B!<eos> Oh, it's so good to see you.<eos> Yo, Rafiqa!<eos> This Barack's woman, Michelle.<eos> - He done well for himself. - Mm-hmm.
Please.<eos> 'Will you marry me?<eos> - No.'<eos> 'Why?<eos> - Because we're still kids.'<eos> 'So..will you marry me when we grow up? '<eos> 'Then you must cut your hair.<eos> - Promise.'<eos> 'Do you promise?<eos> - I do.'
Paul Williams?<eos> Paul Williams, right?<eos> He's a pioneer of the California regency movement.<eos> Really great designer.<eos> Designed a lot in the fifties, which is when it looks this house is from.<eos> He's black, incidentally, which doesn't really--<eos> I'm sorry. Do I care about anything you're saying right now?<eos> Nikki: No, you don't.<eos> Don't you have somewhere to go?<eos> Yes. He does.
Maura was trying to tell us about a tunnel.<eos> But not a tunnel that was exposed to temperature variations.<eos> Our paint chip had never been exposed to high temperatures.<eos> Which means car tunnels are out.<eos> Those are like ovens in the summer.<eos> Yeah, we searched the entire Asylum.<eos> There aren't any tunnels here.<eos> That's because according to the blueprints,<eos> Arkush doesn't have tunnels.<eos> Sure, it does.
So how did you guys meet?<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> We were at the gym and she didn't have a spotter, so I just came over and... thank goodness she was being irresponsible.<eos> You know, don't you love how that stuff just happens?<eos> When I was looking for a seatmate, I found a soulmate.<eos> Oh.<eos> Wow.<eos> And now I love him more than my own life.<eos> Oh, don't say that.<eos> No, I do.
I didn't...<eos> That's an odd thing for a confidence coach to say.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> That was lousy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But you're right.<eos> No, Mitchell, no I'm not.<eos> She deserves better.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Thomas is going to be there.<eos> I am not interested.<eos> Honey, it's time.<eos> You need to find someone new.<eos> For me?<eos> Ethan?<eos> This just came for you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And this just came for you.<eos> Yes it did, yes it did.
And what the hell happened?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> I was talking to him and he was smiling and then next thing I know, he's screaming.<eos> Oh, my God, what did I do?<eos> Emily, listen.<eos> The kid moved, okay?<eos> You told him not to but he did, he moved right when you were cutting.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> An accident caused by a squirming child, that's all.<eos> But he didn't.
Emily, what are you doing?<eos> All right, everyone, it's time for the maid of honor to talk.<eos> And get comfy, 'cause I tend to get a little chatty after champagne.<eos> Okay, so, I've known Emily since freshman year of college.<eos> That's when she was going through what I like to call her "mom jeans" phase.<eos> But with my guidance she rebounded from fashion disaster.<eos> Sweetie, dial it back.<eos> When she met Will, I knew it was special.<eos> She never talked about boys, so when she brought him up, I just knew that...<eos> Okay, Em, kind of doing something up here.
"farewell," or something more colloquial.<eos> "Bye-bye"?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> She's repeating it in Latin.<eos> She doesn't speak Latin.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I never believed in the Devil or demons, or any of this shit, but there is something else controlling her.<eos> Tell me you don't see that.<eos> I do.
I hate to mix business with pleasure.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - But my expenses.<eos> - What about them?<eos> - Well, they're a bit higher than anticipated.<eos> One thing in particular, that dang walk-in.<eos> That bill is a real whopper.<eos> - I know, it's a problem, all that ice cream.<eos> - I don't want to overstep my bounds here. But, we may have found a solution.<eos> Or Joan did, actually.
Yeah, a guy named McDonald.<eos> He's never going to get pushed around in life.<eos> - That's clearly not the case.<eos> - So, you don't have a check for $1.35 million dollars in your pocket?<eos> Bye, Dick.<eos> - So if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em.<eos> - I remember the first time I saw that name stretched across your stand out there.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> I knew right then and there, I had to have it.<eos> - And now I do.
I mean, I-I knew her.<eos> She loved him.<eos> Well, they were obsessed with each other.<eos> And she really did love him.<eos> They had hot sex.<eos> Which, of course, became a problem after they broke up, because O.J. knew that she needed it all the time.<eos> And it absolutely drove him crazy.<eos> You know, when she was at that little house on Gretna Green, he used to hide in the bushes and watch her have sex with other guys.<eos> Did she know that O.J. was out there?<eos> Of course she did!
He's one of those people that thinks that you can't see how he really feels because he acts polite.<eos> Well, that makes no sense, because when someone acts polite, then they are polite.<eos> Am I out of line, saying you're bringing a preconception to this because you're black?<eos> All right, Marcia, I don't expect you to understand.<eos> But there's a way that certain white people talk to black people.<eos> It's disingenuous.<eos> - Fuhrman doesn't have to be a witness.<eos> - What?<eos> He's not even the cop who entered the gloves into evidence; he doesn't have to take the stand.<eos> Yes, he does.
Ms.Lopez,justto confirm your occupation, you are the housekeeper of Mr. Simpson's neighbor, is that correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mr. Cochran has moved the court to disrupt our schedule because you threatened to leave the country, since you're being hounded by the press.<eos> I stay just for today for Mr. Johnnie.<eos> Tomorrow, I fly.<eos> So when did you make this flight reservation for El Salvador?<eos> This morning.<eos> Really?<eos> Yesterday, Mr. Cochran stated that you had had one then.<eos> I did.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, listen up.<eos> This sequester has very simple rules.<eos> You're not to talk about the case with anyone.<eos> That includes each other.<eos> You're not to talk to the other hotel guests at any time, for any reason.<eos> Once in the hotel, you will not be permitted to leave your floor.<eos> You're not allowed in another juror's room for any reason.<eos> Deputies will be on duty in the halls and elsewhere to supervise you at all times.<eos> Do you and each of you understand and agree that you will well and truly try the cause now pending before this court and a true verdict render according only to the evidence presented to you and to the instructions of the court, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Trot on.<eos> Trot on.<eos> Trot on.<eos> Here come the fucking cavalry.<eos> Late as usual.<eos> Dearly beloved.<eos> We are gathered here today to join together in holy matrimony Thomas Michael Shelby and Grace Helen Burgess.<eos> Those flowers need to go there.<eos> Do you, Thomas Michael Shelby, take Grace Helen Burgess to be your lawful wedded wife?<eos> I do.
You look absolutely beautiful.<eos> Welcome to the family.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Tommy's orders.<eos> No upsets tonight.<eos> Your hair, everything.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
But it's very hard when you're man and wife.<eos> We were late coming down because we were having sex.<eos> Afterwards he told me everything.<eos> Royalist Russians buying weapons to fight the Bolsheviks in Georgia.<eos> A lost cause, Tommy says.<eos> Churchill is the go-between but it's against government policy so everything must be kept a secret.<eos> You know it's begun.<eos> They started the business tonight.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
- You better put a chain on your poodle.<eos> - Fuck you, Gracey.<eos> Yo sis, you good?<eos> Yeah, you know me.<eos> I can handle my own, big bro.<eos> You have got to learn proper hood protocol if you're gonna go snooping around.<eos> And the first rule is you don't go out alone.<eos> Not after seven and certainly not in the Valley.<eos> - How'd you know where I was?<eos> - Actually I didn't.
You will watch as my dogs devour your wild little brother.<eos> Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest.<eos> Come and see.<eos> Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North."<eos> Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.<eos> His father's dead.<eos> Ramsay killed him.<eos> - And now he has Rickon.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
What's left for you here?<eos> You wouldn't be safe.<eos> Not while she's looking for me.<eos> Who?<eos> She doesn't have a name.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Essos is east and Westeros is west.<eos> But what's west of Westeros?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
I'd like to see that.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Milk of the poppy.<eos> I don't want any.<eos> Sleep is the only way you'll heal.<eos> Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.<eos> Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.<eos> I was a famous kisser.<eos> You lads know how to kiss proper?<eos> Course we do.
Well, that's a different sort of fighting.<eos> Now, that's the truth, isn't it?<eos> You want to learn that sort of fighting?<eos> All right.<eos> All right, let's start with your footwork.<eos> Show me your stance.<eos> Now listen to me, Pod.<eos> See how your feet are about a yard apart?<eos> Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you.<eos> 'Cause they do, Pod.
And if I had to put my faith in anyone to save the Four Lands, it would be her. Hmm...<eos> Don't even say it.<eos> I think these belong to you.<eos> Now...<eos> I put the question to you, esteemed members of the Council.<eos> Will you allow Amberle to return to the Sanctuary and fulfill her sacred duty?<eos> Amberle Elessedil, you turned your back on the Chosen and your duties to the Ellcrys.<eos> I did.<eos> And now you wish to carry its seed to the Bloodfire.<eos> I do.
With good reason.<eos> The Breakline is no place for an Elf.<eos> It's no place for anyone as long as Demons inhabit it.<eos> Diana. How did you know that I'd be here?<eos> Because when someone tells you no, you tend to do the opposite.<eos> If you're here to stop me, save your breath.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> What you're doing is treason.<eos> If you have a better idea, I'm all points.<eos> - We do.
The tree said I had to do it to prove I was ready for what's ahead.<eos> I'm sorry you had to do that.<eos> Not as sorry as I am.<eos> The things we've seen since this all started.<eos> All the innocent blood that's been spilled.<eos> You know, and what's the point?<eos> Now that I know what my grandfather did in the name of our kind?<eos> Maybe you were right about the Elves.<eos> Maybe we don't deserve saving.<eos> Yeah, maybe none of us do.
And I was like...<eos> - Wait, when was this?<eos> - This was like first year of college.<eos> - Oh, was it that guy that was like always like...<eos> - Marcus.<eos> - Always around? He like hung out like all the time.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - And I was like, "Oh, there's something between you."<eos> Oh, so there was something between you.<eos> - Yeah, you knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't! - Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that's about the right size.<eos> - Where's Mindy?<eos> - I don't know, where is Mindy?<eos> I think she's with my sister.<eos> - Doing?<eos> - I don't know, I think they're doing girl stuff.<eos> We got caterers coming.<eos> - I know.<eos> You know how much I love to make sweet potato casserole.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Fred, put the siren on.<eos> Get me to the Port Committee, quick!<eos> Regional Prefect?<eos> I believe the port should be modernized so I'm in favor of the sale.<eos> - Development Minister?<eos> - In favor.<eos> And the representative for the Minister of Finance?<eos> In favor.<eos> You don't want a casino?<eos> No, we don't.
Come look.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Taste.<eos> Blessed.<eos> I knew that chicken.<eos> - What?<eos> I have seen that his neck was reversed, most recently at the farm of Chardoul.<eos> Chardoul?<eos> Do you Thomas?
Now they say you are going to Timbuktu to study.<eos> Far, far away.<eos> Instead of serving the king or taking a wife.<eos> Jinna.<eos> Look, will you slow down?<eos> I agree.<eos> And you should only choose the right warrior.<eos> Jinna, I'm the right warrior.<eos> You know this.<eos> We both do.
You'll eat or suck metal, but food will get in your belly.<eos> We got more work up on deck, boys.<eos> Kunta Kinte.<eos> You will not live if you do not eat.<eos> Let me die.<eos> Kunta!<eos> Live!<eos> See what comes!<eos> Do you know what will come? !<eos> Does Allah? !
I had always been called Katende.<eos> She was the one who told me my name was Robert.<eos> Robert Katende, I'm your mother.<eos> I stayed with her for two years.<eos> And she became my everything.<eos> Then, this one Saturday... my grandmother came crying Mother's name.<eos> And I knew, in that moment, that... Mama had died.<eos> I lost her for a second time.<eos> I, too, thought things could never change.<eos> But they did.
Is that what you want to hear?<eos> Well, the truth is, I knew you were safe, and with all the things that we had to do,<eos> Yeah.<eos> I could tell you were pretty busy back there.<eos> We converted a nuclear warhead into a power source.<eos> With the added power, A.L.I.E. Was able to complete the work she began with her creator a hundred years ago.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Look. I'm still leaving this place in a rowboat.<eos> I need you.<eos> Of course you do, more food for the sea monster, right?
Hey.<eos> - Ok. Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> Enough!<eos> We have to move it.<eos> Wait.<eos> It's been cut down.<eos> Bellamy: You don't know that.<eos> We do now.
I'm gathering the Parliament.<eos> I know the German Ambassador, Curt Bräuer.<eos> He is a supporter of Norwegian neutrality.<eos> - And we want to trade?<eos> - The Parliament will discuss this now.<eos> We're staying in the city, at the theatre.<eos> I have other news that might be heavy for you.<eos> Your brother, King Christian, surrendered Denmark at 05:00 this morning.<eos> If it helps, he did not have much choice.<eos> No, he probably didn't.
This is more my taste.<eos> This is good.<eos> Yes?<eos> Foreign Minister?<eos> In a few hours the Government surely will accept the terms.<eos> - Excellent!<eos> - Yes, but...<eos> - This Quisling will never be accepted as a leader of the Government.<eos> - We like Mr. Quisling.<eos> - We all do.
About what?<eos> About homecoming.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> Yeah, sure I was.<eos> I mean, we could go if you wanted to.<eos> Or not.<eos> It's just a dumb dance.<eos> I do.

I didn't want to be on camera. That's just silly.<eos> You're a good dancer.<eos> You shouldn't be so afraid of stuff.<eos> I lied to my parents.<eos> What?<eos> I told my parents I was going to Frenchie's to study because they won't let me go to dances.<eos> That's why I didn't want to be on camera.<eos> I didn't want them to find out that I lied to them just to be with you.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Well, now you do.
That's why I didn't want to be on camera.<eos> I didn't want them to find out that I lied to them just to be with you.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Well, now you do.<eos> Well, I think you're lucky to have parents that care so much about you.<eos> I know.<eos> Mine don't care about anything.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sandy, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't... oh.
Local experts inform the council yet again about the severe weather set to hit the coast in the next few days.<eos> Residents and flood risk areas are advised to ensure to take necessary precautions in the events of flooding.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I didn't expect this.<eos> You here for lunch?<eos> You left your ID.<eos> You came all this way for that?<eos> Thought you'd need it.<eos> No, I...<eos> I do, thanks.
I have to hand it to you, Tom, you're a smart man...<eos> Are you in or out, Charlie?<eos> Curly?<eos> - Shouldn't have killed the stag, Tommy.<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> - Bad luck...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> How do we know this foolish man will hand over the diamonds<eos> - when we're done?<eos> - We don't.
Arthur.<eos> Arthur, come here.<eos> Shalom!<eos> Arthur, shalom!<eos> Alfie.<eos> Shalom.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come on, listen...<eos> I owe you a little something, don't I?<eos> I do.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> As we agreed, your jeweller will now select items to a total value of £70,000.<eos> When you have selected your chosen items, they will be put into a box and stored.<eos> When you have fulfilled your part of the deal, the box will be delivered to you.<eos> May I just start, right, by saying that I may choose to stay here and just starve to death and choke on sapphires rather than ever go back to the fucking world again?<eos> Yeah, well, there is a good reason for that, you know, little man.<eos> Because my shop, right, is just above a rum house, so all the...<eos> - You speak Russian?<eos> - I do, yeah. I do.
Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Detective Gordon, within hours of your encounter,<eos> Theo Galavan was found beaten and shot to death.<eos> Were you present at the time of his murder?<eos> Ah, well, here we are.<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Do you have any information regarding the case that you have not shared with us?<eos> This is for my mother.<eos> No, I do not.
Well, so, it would take a human body significantly longer, depending on mass<eos> - and body fat, of course.<eos> - So why would a cop stand around for hours, waiting to get frozen?<eos> She wouldn't.<eos> Which means your suspect wasn't using liquid nitrogen.<eos> He was using supercooled liquid helium.<eos> It's one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction.<eos> This liquid helium, where do you get it?<eos> - Why do you need it?<eos> - He doesn't, dummy.
But your pain... it blocks you from who I need you to become.<eos> Who Gotham needs you to become.<eos> If one's feelings and emotions are strong enough, their consequences can follow you back into the real world.<eos> I don't know what you want from me.<eos> Over the centuries, we've tried to end the cycle of crime and violence that plagues Gotham, only for it to start up again.<eos> And do you know why it does?<eos> People are afraid.<eos> And fear breeds hopelessness.<eos> I'm supposed to believe you care about the people of Gotham?<eos> I do.
Ginny.<eos> How's my favorite I.A. sugar plum, huh?<eos> Well, why do you think I'm calling, baby?<eos> Heard you were getting married.<eos> She changed her mind.<eos> Smart girl.<eos> Oh. Oh, you're an animal, Bullock,<eos> - you know that?<eos> - Oh, yes, ma'am.<eos> I do, I do.
Sometimes we never find out.<eos> It happens.<eos> I need you to give me the Wayne files.<eos> You take this, and I'll give you the Wayne files.<eos> Call her.<eos> I'll go get 'em.<eos> It was nothing that you did or didn't do, Alfred.<eos> Why I went away.<eos> I want you to know that.<eos> I do.
Exclusively the lumbar.<eos> So my spine'll hurt a little.<eos> It's only a highway holding all your body's nerves.<eos> Mm-hmm. You guys have an extra mouse for my computer?<eos> No.<eos> But, hey, here, you can borrow mine.<eos> Terry knows his keyboard shortcuts!<eos> Whoop. Just deleted everything.<eos> - Sir, we have a problem.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
Gina, come on.<eos> You can do your Internet socializing in the truck.<eos> Okay, cool, I just have to tie my shoe real quick.<eos> Tying it.<eos> Call Jake Peralta.<eos> Gina, hey, how's the stalling?<eos> Great; the tow truck just got here, so that'll buy us at least an hour.<eos> Tow truck? What the hell did you do to my car?<eos> Bitch, I told you I was gonna wreck it.<eos> You did.

- Oh, she started stripping?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Boss impaled her on a pole when he caught her skimming tips.<eos> Ooh! Damn, dude.<eos> Look, coming back from 12 years undercover is not easy for anyone.<eos> I'm sure Diaz gets it.<eos> She's so in touch with her feelings.<eos> And me, hmm.<eos> After what I've seen, after what I've done, I don't know that I deserve to be happy.<eos> Of course you do.
Let's go for a walk.<eos> He wanted me to tell you that he loves you.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Did he say anything else?<eos> Um... May the lord be with you.<eos> - Adrian.<eos> - Oh, thank God.<eos> You scared me.<eos> I thought you left.<eos> I did.
Dirty ones?<eos> Maybe.<eos> It's nice we're so disconnected from cell phones.<eos> Disconnect to reconnect, right?<eos> I guess.<eos> It's a great name for an album cover.<eos> I love this.<eos> I think you need it more than I do, though.<eos> I have a great sense of direction.<eos> Yeah, sure you do.
In case we don't make it till the morning.<eos> You think we'll be safer when we get to daylight?<eos> No.<eos> It's just easier to run from it when you can see it comin' at ya.<eos> Whatever it takes, we'll beat it.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But you don't have what it takes.<eos> Nobody does.
- I thought we were seeing a film.<eos> How sweet!<eos> Okay, I'll check out my parents' room.<eos> - Ta-dah! - Are you sure it'll work?<eos> Why shouldn't it work?<eos> - Maybe it's out of date.<eos> - May 2017.<eos> What is it?<eos> Don't you want to do this?<eos> No, I do.
Hello?<eos> It's Tong.<eos> Has Sun given his statement?<eos> I'm off duty. I'm leaving.<eos> How would I know?<eos> I'm not a cop!<eos> I really didn't know.<eos> I didn't.<eos> How would I know?<eos> I didn't.
- No, no, no, no, no. Richie's okay.<eos> He don't need to do any blow 'cause he already did all of it.<eos> That's right. You know what?<eos> I'm gonna get out of here.<eos> I'm gonna go in the front.<eos> When you're done with these clowns, you come and meet me up there, we'll do a little "Three Sisters."<eos> You see?<eos> He's intelligent. He knows.<eos> He knows. You see?<eos> - He does.
Julie loves you.<eos> Yeah, but nobody is safe if we get bought out.<eos> Nobody, okay?<eos> Especially me. I've got zero signings to my name this year.<eos> Every band I approach, they say they don't like my face.<eos> - What?<eos> - Is there something wrong with my face? Just tell me.<eos> Just tell me, it's fine.<eos> No, Clark, we just scored the Zeppelin deal.<eos> Richie did.
I adopted her.<eos> - Oh. - Lizzie, she's my little princess.<eos> She's, like... all I have in the world, so...<eos> - Oh, that's awesome!<eos> - Yeah. - I got to keep it together because of her.<eos> - Wow. - And, uh, it's why I'm working three jobs, that I... - Yeah.<eos> Hate.<eos> Well, I'll drink to that. Well, I don't do that anymore, so...<eos> - No. Shit!<eos> - I don't do that.
Uh, you need to put that out right now or we're gonna call the cops.<eos> Oh, you're gonna call the cops on The G.<eos> All right. Don't be a buzzkill.<eos> Get out of my sight.<eos> Man, I been seeing you shitheads all night.<eos> What the holy hell do you want?<eos> What do a bunch of Columbian drug lords care about Al-Qaeda anyway?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> This ain't my first rodeo, hombre.<eos> And what if I don't?
Which is why I find myself unnerved by the thought that when this pattern applies itself to you and I... that I will be the end of you.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Now, three who preceded me all had one thing in common.<eos> They were vulnerable to you.<eos> Had more to lose than you, less means with which to protect themselves than you.<eos> Till recently, I thought that was me as well, but now...<eos> I don't know that it is anymore.<eos> It is natural for men new to power to assume that it has no limits.<eos> Trust me.<eos> It does.
It's a little bit... It's a little bit sad.<eos> You know, all this stuff together.<eos> I don't know why that is.<eos> Not... I mean... Do you know what I mean?<eos> It's really beautiful, Abbie.<eos> Do you want to fool around... With me?<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
It's interesting.<eos> What's it like... for girls?<eos> What?<eos> Sex?<eos> Orgasms.<eos> Do you really want to know what it's like?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't have them.<eos> What?<eos> None of my friends do.
Sure, what the hell?<eos> You bring a checkbook with you, mrs. Finestra?<eos> Great.<eos> There's a 150 charge for this meeting<eos> And sylvia will give you a questionnaire.<eos> You can fill it out at home.<eos> Your secretary said on the phone That there would be no charge for the initial consultation.<eos> Well, she was mistaken.<eos> What if I hadn't brought my checkbook?<eos> Lucky for me you did.
What's the matter with Sonya?<eos> Natasha, go and see!<eos> - Don't go. Promise?<eos> - I promise.<eos> Champagne?<eos> - Oh, I probably shouldn't.<eos> What is it? What's the matter?<eos> He doesn't love me any more.<eos> He loves Julie Karagina.<eos> No, he doesn't!
Is there anything you'd like to get off your chest, Mr. Gamby?<eos> I mean, nothing really comes to the mind.<eos> Well, this complaint says, and I quote,<eos> "She's not very smart, and if she's in charge, "this school will suffer in a horrible way.<eos> "Dr. Brown only cares about herself.<eos> "She really thinks she's something."<eos> Now, who would write such a thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not sure. Does it say who wrote it?<eos> Why, yes, it does.
I mean, maybe.<eos> I hope so.<eos> They do make us look like we suck like shit though. - I'm telling you.<eos> - Dayshawn, do not talk about sucking shit in front of Ms. Swift.<eos> - That is not appropriate.<eos> - I'm sorry, Ms. Swift.<eos> My name is Dayshawn.<eos> I like your glasses.<eos> Do you have boyfriend?<eos> Do you?
Great. Fantastic. Never see you again.<eos> Never talk to you ever again in my life. Fine.<eos> What is going on right now?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> He's just being a freak.<eos> Come on, Seychelles.<eos> - You're being a little freak.<eos> - You are.<eos> You are... being a freak.<eos> - Out of the corner of my eye. You do. - A little bit?
- Okay. I got it. Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Nice and smooth on the throttle. Stop hovering, okay?<eos> You're making me nervous.<eos> - Back up. Back it up.<eos> - Hey, you got it? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yup. Bam.<eos> There we go. Um, well, you need to loosen up.<eos> You look, uh, you look awkward.<eos> I feel like I look pretty cool.<eos> No, you do not.
(Mixed cheers) Yeah, fucking suck that!<eos> Woman: Ju-li-an!<eos> Hey, girls.<eos> Both: Hey, baby.<eos> Hi! He has time for us.<eos> Are you coming to the bedroom?<eos> Yeah, you promised.<eos> You guys want to shut it down?<eos> Ooh!<eos> Yeah, we do.
These are for you.<eos> Richard Roper was recently a guest at the Meisters Hotel.<eos> Do whatever you want with those.<eos> I don't want to be involved.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, why did you do it?<eos> Why does Jonathan Pine, respected hotelier, risk his career by snitching on his guests?<eos> First in Cairo and then here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
I can get you a copy of the Employment Act if you want.<eos> You'd be better off rehearsing:<eos> "Would sir like chips with that?"<eos> Save you time.<eos> He can work for me.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> You could work for me, if you wanted to.<eos> I do, I do want to.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay, um, and how did that go?<eos> Well, I was doing some e-mailing, - right? And<eos> - Yeah. Okay. - ...on the browser there,<eos> Okay, so you typed in "gay" into your browser for no apparent reason.<eos> Well, I was looking for porn sites.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But the point is, I met someone online, and I decided to come to the city and meet him in person.<eos> Okay. Um, what happened?<eos> He didn't look anything like his Internet photo.<eos> - Yeah, well, they never do.
- Just making sure.<eos> You got nothing to worry about, baby.<eos> Harry.<eos> Hope it's not too late.<eos> I just got home.<eos> What's up?<eos> Headed your way, actually.<eos> I told you we're fine.<eos> It's that case I told you about.<eos> Our victim did business there.
Allen had a jumbo first and a home equity loan.<eos> Say Veronica sells for 4.4.<eos> With commissions and capital gains, she'll be lucky to clear 200K.<eos> I wonder why he was using his house as an ATM.<eos> Let's keep an eye on probate, see how the estate settles.<eos> The thing is this guy was a money launderer.<eos> Who knows what he's got squirreled away and where?<eos> The widow, maybe?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe she does.
- Seriously?<eos> - You're stickin' with that story?<eos> Oh, I'm gonna take a murder wrap over a $200 throwaway?<eos> How stupid do you think I am?<eos> I mean, this shit's ridiculous.<eos> And yet, here we are.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> I didn't kill Tony Allen.<eos> Why'd Joey Marks order the hit on him?<eos> He didn't.
I'm workin' a case.<eos> Gotta go in.<eos> I'll get my stuff.<eos> Grace'll watch 'em like a hawk.<eos> Yeah, I'm okay with it.<eos> Makes me feel like the danger's over, and we should just go home.<eos> I'm not really sure about that, so just humor me, okay?<eos> Stick around a couple more days.<eos> I think you just like having us here.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Maybe we can stop at the beach on the way to the airport.<eos> Maddie'd like that.<eos> I moved back to L.A. a few years ago after my husband passed.<eos> I was born here.<eos> I wanted to die here.<eos> I had no idea you'd grown up to be a detective till I saw your name in the paper... yours and Marjorie's.<eos> That case had nothing to do with my mother.<eos> It was just a lawyer dragging her name through the mud, trying to get to me.<eos> You said you know who killed her.<eos> Yes, I do.
A thousand stolen elections cannot change that.<eos> ...by the fangs of a black snake, let us not be bitten.<eos> And yet, my son will be Khan, and his son after him.<eos> Let us always trust one another.<eos> My bloodline is certain, and yours will end this night.<eos> I say this, not just as Mongols, but as people under the Mongol Empire!<eos> Open the gates to outsiders, secrets will spill!<eos> Brother.<eos> I should've left you there to bleed out in that cave.<eos> Probably... but you didn't.
For real, that's the problem with this country.<eos> No one knows what goes down.<eos> America is fake as fuck.<eos> The government did all that shit.<eos> The government.<eos> To make Americans hate real Muslims.<eos> A lot of people who say they were at 9/11, they're all actors.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> - Well, now you know.<eos> Of course you didn't.
Yeah.<eos> I think so.<eos> So, a feedback oscillator.<eos> And a bigger battery.<eos> Do you have a soldering iron?<eos> This isn't for a trick, is it?<eos> For what it's worth, I didn't want to bail on the scholarship.<eos> But I had to.<eos> I just want you to know that.<eos> I do.
Put away your toys.<eos> Boys, follow me.<eos> We'll meet you at the door.<eos> Some kind of adventure you're having, huh?<eos> I don't want an adventure.<eos> So, is Elliot loving school?<eos> Oh, well, so far so good.<eos> We'll see how it goes.<eos> I bet you cried your eyes out with your only one going off to college.<eos> -Well... -She did.
-No, they are not nonsense,<eos> Ms. Diaz, and I'm reluctant to return children to a parent who's using drugs.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no,<eos> I just had a couple of puffs on a joint. I didn't know it had anything in it.<eos> And she told me the drug test was gonna be for heroin or crack<eos> -and of course I'm-- -hold on, Ms. Diaz, this is a conversation you should be having with your attorney in private.<eos> Your honor, if I can just have<eos> -a second with my client. -I trust you understand how many cases we have backed up today.<eos> I do, I do.
Come on, David, let's go.<eos> Do I look like him?<eos> What?<eos> I just wanna know before I go in there.<eos> Do I look like him?<eos> Yeah, maybe a little.<eos> What should I call him?<eos> David, why are you asking me these questions now?<eos> -Call him whatever you want. -You never even told me his name.<eos> -I did.
Come on.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> I was hurt when you told me to hold on to Jason.<eos> I knew you were upset about that.<eos> I was thinking more as a man than as a father.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Men are weaker than women.<eos> A lot of temptation out there and men are the first to fall.<eos> -You really believe that?<eos> -Yeah, I do.
I totally get it.<eos> - Oh. - We should move in together.<eos> It's, like, you're so crazy right now. Like, I gotta be, like, watching over you all the time, making sure you're okay, because I'm the sane one.<eos> You know, I'll be your rock.<eos> I knew something was up, 'cause I texted you so much...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And you didn't respond.<eos> No.<eos> And I texted your mom actually.<eos> - You did?
Volunteer sign-ups for search parties are still available in the office.<eos> Oh, this is weird.<eos> -He's never this late.<eos> -I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.<eos> I thought you liked his plan.<eos> Yeah, but obviously it was stupid, or he'd be here.<eos> If his mom found out a girl spent the night--<eos> He's in deep shit right about now.<eos> Hey, what if she slept naked?<eos> Oh, my God, she didn't.
Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger?<eos> He sounded a lot like that.<eos> Did you guys not see what I saw?<eos> They pulled Will's body out of the water.<eos> He's dead!<eos> Well, maybe it's his ghost.<eos> Maybe he's haunting us.<eos> -It's not his ghost.<eos> -So how do you know that?<eos> -I just do!
I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> What, you're sorry? You're... you're sorry?<eos> -That is not good enough, Jonathan.<eos> -I know. That's not even close.<eos> That's not even in the... in the ballpark.<eos> I wanted to tell you, I just--<eos> What if this thing took you, too?<eos> You risked your life... and Nancy's.<eos> I thought I could save Will...<eos> I still do.
That was a hell of a throw.<eos> ...late fumble recovery for the winning touchdown late in the game.<eos> We're wasting time.<eos> I'm sorry for this setting. It's the only quiet spot around here.<eos> In Acts, how do Paul and Silas prepare for trial?<eos> They sing.<eos> Where's Clarence?<eos> They're ready for him.<eos> Judge, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Fuck tenure.<eos> Come in.<eos> Professor, they're ready for you now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hearing will come to order.<eos> Welcome, Professor.<eos> We thank you on behalf of the Committee for making time for this. I know it wasn't easy, and we appreciate that.<eos> Uh, please stand to be sworn in.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Sit down.<eos> Now, I want you to go back to your bloomberg and cut bait on your losers -- you know the ones.<eos> The ones you've been defending, hoping they'll come 'round, but, secretly, you know never will.<eos> I want you to just commit that you're in it for the long haul, that you will succeed.<eos> And once you do that, the new ideas, the winners, will present themselves because you are a winner.<eos> You're in the special forces here.<eos> You are a Navy seal.<eos> And there's a reason for that.<eos> Did the s.E.A.L.S make a mistake signing you up?<eos> No. They did not.
I lost every one of my friends that day.<eos> And you've managed to make some new ones since.<eos> But like I said, they may be cheering now, but believe me, they are dying to boo.<eos> Moderator: And now from the other side, the man whose job is to ride herd over the bulls and bears,<eos> Chuck rhoades.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Denny dantone's coming in with an offer on the Norton house -- $62 million.<eos> Prepared to close in less than a week, I hear.<eos> How the fuck did he see it?<eos> He didn't.
You got me into this.<eos> Into XHP's pants? - Mmm...<eos> - His name is Emery.<eos> Well, the names change, you're just using the tools at your disposal.<eos> How's Christine?<eos> Nice deflection tactic.<eos> As your intern?<eos> That's not what you were asking.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> Yes, you do.
To Managing Partner?<eos> No, to Head of Maintenance.<eos> Yeah, Managing Partner.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That was shitty.<eos> I just wanted to let you know before they did.<eos> I asked to stay on XHP with you.<eos> Thanks for the consolation prize.<eos> You deserved it.<eos> No, I didn't.
This is so cute.<eos> Stop touching me there!<eos> I'm sorry, I'm really ticklish.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> Oh, absolutely not.<eos> My wife and I used to do this on sailing trips.<eos> I should have said "ex-wife".<eos> No, I just never heard you talk about her before.<eos> I didn't feel like I knew you before.<eos> Well, you do now.
You happy?<eos> I'm always happy, Stan.<eos> Sadness is for suckers.<eos> Come on, we'll get an egg cream.<eos> But, Ms. Green, your poetry contest was poetry writing, not poetry reciting.<eos> So, you did write it.<eos> -I didn't say that.<eos> -I don't know why it is, Ezekiel, that you seem to want to be nothing, when with just a little courage... you could really be something.<eos> I got courage.<eos> No, you don't.
No, forget Jamaica.<eos> France is where it's at.<eos> Man, I hear French girls go topless in their motorboats.<eos> - I hear that, too.<eos> - For real?<eos> How Mylene look topless?<eos> - Shut up, Boo.<eos> - Yo. Yo.<eos> He don't know.<eos> You don't.
Uh, yeah.<eos> - Shut the front door.<eos> - Oh, stop it.<eos> He's not a prize steer.<eos> Here I've been worrying my head off about you.<eos> Meanwhile, you have been living the dream.<eos> How does this happen?<eos> Oh, you know how these things happen.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I honestly don't.
She's the one that was there when...<eos> Oh, you're the one.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You are so lucky you're alive.<eos> Do you realize that there have been four construction fatalities in Manhattan this year?<eos> I already filed a complaint with OSHA, but I hop you'll file as well.<eos> Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> Kelsey, I got Thad's laptop, which I'd like to access.<eos> - Do you have the password?<eos> - I don't, no.
Like, what, how big?<eos> Like, what are you gonna do?<eos> I prefer not to talk about it right now.<eos> - Do you not know?<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, my gosh. You don't know.<eos> - I know.<eos> If you don't know, then why do you wanna be boss?<eos> - I know.<eos> - You don't.
Why not? Dad, being straight edge is more than just veganism and abstinence.<eos> It's about subversion of dominant culture.<eos> Modeling doesn't give off the right message.<eos> Does this have anything to do with the fact that your modeling gig is for the Sears catalog?<eos> [Rita] You know, a lot of big models got their start doing catalog work.<eos> Tyra Banks.<eos> - See? - Marty, she's an African-American model of prominence.<eos> Dad, I thought you'd be happy.<eos> I thought you didn't want me to be a model.<eos> I don't.
- Spill it.<eos> Well... it's just you guys are so amazing.<eos> And it's really rough out there, and it's nice to be around something so great.<eos> And I-I'm not really a love match with your son, but I think I might be in love with you guys.<eos> Jess, we-we are glad that you think that<eos> - we're amazing.<eos> And we think<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> - That you're amazing.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I have to show you a painting, Nick.<eos> I have to show you a painting.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Okay, what if I'm serious, Nick?<eos> Don't you think we should wait a little bit?<eos> Emily: Why?<eos> Nick, why? Nick:<eos> Because that's what people do. Emily:<eos> What do we care what people do?<eos> - We don't.
Come on.<eos> El Lazo has agreed to have an audience with y'all tomorrow.<eos> In the meantime, there's a brothel I recommend.<eos> Ooh, they have a contortionist.<eos> Oh, I don't think Dolores would find that very interesting.<eos> Who the fuck cares what Dolores wants?<eos> She's a goddamn doll!<eos> Hey, can you not say that around her?<eos> I swear, I feel like she understands.<eos> Of course you do.
We're not exactly in a culture where we can just let loose.<eos> I would have thought the head of narrative could do whatever he wanted.<eos> My artistic freedom is constrained, what, with QA breathing down my neck and behavior programming the damn things to go off script.<eos> The robots can go off script?<eos> Just little gestures.<eos> You know, supposedly, it makes the things more lifelike, but, really, it's just a vanity project from the megalomaniac who started this place.<eos> And frankly, I don't know why the suits at Delos put up with it.<eos> Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you off.<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> - I do.
That is almost three times the baseline.<eos> Just hang on a second. You only apologized to us so that we would resign?<eos> No. I meant every word of what I said.<eos> - You guys really are my brothers.<eos> - Oh, yeah. And equal pay was bullshit, too, - or what?<eos> - Now, no... - You... Hold it.<eos> They don't know what it means.<eos> That means equal pay.<eos> It's, everybody's gonna make the same. Yeah.<eos> - DO... Yes. - Across the board, yes.
I'll be happy to tell him you came by.<eos> No.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, please.<eos> Now listen, I... I just got word about Arthur and I know two people in Memphis.<eos> And one of 'em's dead.<eos> The other one's your husband.<eos> I know that it's a late hour and all, but I just drove straight through from Houston when I got the news.<eos> It's... it's 10 hours, and if I could just use your bathroom and your phone, call my wife, let her know I'm safe, I... I'd really appreciate it.<eos> Why didn't you call ahead?<eos> Well, I... I did earlier.
Marcus won't tie my shoe!<eos> Keep it down in there, please.<eos> - Do it yourself, you baby.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have you... have you... have you heard any more, uh,<eos> - from the cops?<eos> - No. Why, you talk to 'em?<eos> Mm, yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
- But you're going, right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's not going to cost you anything, - since she said it's on her.<eos> You'll eat well and have a bit of bubbly.<eos> You'll take her to your place.<eos> You'll light a couple of candles.<eos> And when the time is right...<eos> She got interested in me when she realized who I am.<eos> I don't want to take her for a ride.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm really sorry, but we're out of Prosecco.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Maybe a glass of Ruinart Blanc De Blancs champagne?<eos> Is that your mother?<eos> - No.<eos> Unfortunately we're also out of Ruinart.<eos> I'm sorry, but we have several bottles of Ruinart.<eos> - No, we don't.
Obviously.<eos> Uh... but I live in the second "O."<eos> In "wood." First "O" in "wood."<eos> Yeah!<eos> Go faster, go faster!<eos> Jacob, settle.<eos> - Someone needs a nap.<eos> - Faster!<eos> I don't normally like to gossip, but did you hear that Jacob needs a nap?<eos> I did.
You left me for a year.<eos> ...quite a svelte man in his own right, still in the lead thanks partly to a phenomenal split...<eos> But he better look out.<eos> American Tom Bruce, UCLA grad...<eos> I didn't have a choice, Joni.<eos> The first tour.<eos> You didn't have a choice the first tour.<eos> The second time you did have a choice and you chose to go back and risk your life<eos> - for a...<eos> - No, I didn't.
Uh, he dyes and grooms dogs, so they look like wild animals.<eos> You know, pandas, zebras, tigers.<eos> It's a thing.<eos> I'm sure it is.<eos> -Camels.<eos> -We're done now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come out.<eos> We know you're in there.<eos> No, you don't.
Oh, uh, yes.<eos> Well, there are glasses here.<eos> Ah, shame.<eos> I rather like plastic.<eos> Still, you can't have everything.<eos> I like to treat myself, don't you?<eos> Why should all the bad people have all the good things in life?<eos> Like this?<eos> You had a good morning. Yes, I did.<eos> I did, didn't I?
But they'd have loved to see you.<eos> And me too.<eos> I mean...<eos> Antoine and I would've liked you to meet them.<eos> That's our oldest, she's 8.<eos> Everyone says she looks just like Antoine.<eos> His spitting image.<eos> But we say that of all children, right?<eos> True or not.<eos> - We do.
No but...<eos> That's it, he just...<eos> He has your name, sir.<eos> I mean, Louis.<eos> And, um...<eos> What I think is interesting is that, first and foremost, he has, if we go back, your father's name, and so, needless to say...<eos> Here we go, French kings...<eos> Look, Antoine, I'll just shut up, alright?<eos> And you tell the story.<eos> Or no one does, and...
Hanging in there?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Three words.<eos> Same old, right.<eos> Always these... two or three-word answers.<eos> Like on your postcards.<eos> Or that little smile.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Did they talk to you?<eos> Suzanne just did, right?
I'm scared. You happy?<eos> You guys always have to tell me everything.<eos> And I have to listen<eos> I hate listening.<eos> I hate talking.<eos> We think silent people are good listeners.<eos> But I shut up so people leave me alone.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.
Wish I could do something to help her out.<eos> Medical app or something?<eos> What's all this?<eos> The new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.<eos> Help me open it.<eos> - Mr. Chang what's this?<eos> - It has been in my family since..<eos> Forever.<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Yeah I do.
- You believe it's true?<eos> - I hope not, your highness.<eos> Good news, you're getting marry.<eos> Bad news.<eos> Warrior zhao is on his way.<eos> Kill him.<eos> Brutus, not him, kill zhao.<eos> Ups.<eos> - So, I assumed you have a plan.<eos> - I do.
Man, come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> We don't have all day.<eos> Wow.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We have to get through.<eos> And I need to finish cooking my soup.<eos> How long is that going to take?<eos> - All night.<eos> - We don't.
Of course, you are.<eos> You're the black knight.<eos> You have skills.<eos> Okay, I don't...<eos> I don't get it.<eos> 'Cause, one minute you told me I'm worthless, and after a few lessons, I'm not?<eos> It's not just me who thinks you're not worthless, Jack.<eos> The way the Princess looks at you..<eos> She believes in you.<eos> - She does?
- Jack!<eos> Jack!<eos> - Oh!<eos> You okay?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You came to save me.<eos> I guess.<eos> I knew you will.<eos> You did?
- Yeah, a lot a good did..<eos> - It's not over yet.<eos> What do you mean this not over yet?<eos> In the minute, she's gonna be marriage and we'll die.<eos> Jack, worrying it's not gonna change anything.<eos> Just live in the moment.<eos> No offense, but I think we don't have a moment.<eos> Do you arun take su lin in sickness and in health..<eos> - For better and the worse?<eos> - I do, she does.
That's why I wanted you guys on this.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Let me ask you something, Conway.<eos> You believe what we're fighting for is a worthy cause?<eos> Depends on what you think we're fighting for, Captain.<eos> Well, what do you believe that is?<eos> Prevent the spread of Communism.<eos> Right, well, we secure this gook stockpile in Quan Thang, we secure the lives and safety of hundreds of Marines, maybe thousands.<eos> Now, you believe that's worth something fighting for?<eos> Yes, sir, Captain, I do.
It's me alone onstage and the audience, this massive, worshipful entity.<eos> I sing and they belong to me.<eos> Where'd you come from?<eos> Where'd you come from?<eos> Massapequa.<eos> Gary, Scott Levitt. He's the counsel for American Century Records.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Did you bring the contract?<eos> What?<eos> Yes, I do.
I-I'm sorry. I... Rest now, corporal.<eos> I'll be back to see you soon.<eos> Um... [Chuckles] Yes.<eos> Uh, I'll just wait over here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who's the beanpole?<eos> Mr. Squivers, a medical cadet.<eos> Hmm. I had some reservations about Dr. Hale's assessment.<eos> Did you?<eos> - I did. - Mm.
I'll take it!<eos> I love how you pimped out my club.<eos> I gotta get a picture!<eos> - Okay, let's go to our seat.<eos> - Lady, wrong little person.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome our special guests, the Van Atta Middle School dance team!<eos> Sponsored by Gibbler Style Party Planning! $5 off your next quinceañera.<eos> You guys wanna see more?<eos> But we don't have any more.<eos> Oh, yes, we do. Right, Mom?
Thank you.<eos> The braces came off and my head finally caught up with my ears.<eos> They were floppy.<eos> I thought about trimming them like a Doberman.<eos> I do love to have my belly scratched.<eos> - You two are gonna love working together.<eos> - Oh, we are?<eos> Yeah, Matt's gonna help out while I'm on vacation.<eos> I told you.<eos> Uh... no, you didn't.
I'm not leaving till I get to the bottom of this.<eos> Jesse and I don't have this kind of excitement anymore.<eos> After 28 years of marriage, the only mystery is who's gonna unload the dishwasher.<eos> And it's not a mystery because it's always me.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> It's always me.<eos> Oh, yes, it is.<eos> OK, Aunt Becky, time for a baby break.<eos> - No, he doesn't want to...<eos> - Yeah, he does.
I thought true love was only true in love songs and Fifty Shades of Grey.<eos> The book, not the movie.<eos> But when I'm with you, I know true love can be truly true.<eos> So true.<eos> Kimmy.<eos> Fernando, for the past 15 years you've made every day an adventure.<eos> I don't always understand what you're saying... but I always know that you love me.<eos> And I love you, too.<eos> Fernando, Jesse, do you take Kimmy and Becky to be your lawfully wedded wife and your already-wedded wife?<eos> - I do.

- I need to learn it.<eos> And, you know what?<eos> I'll just... I'll go get the flowers.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Uh, sir?<eos> I'm very sorry, and we will pick this up at a later date.<eos> OK, thanks, Christine.<eos> My source at the police station called it the Tug Show, actually.<eos> - He said that?<eos> - Yes, he did.
Guess who with.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Baby, I'm so happy for you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hi, George.<eos> Why, hello, Christine!<eos> Shall we?<eos> I thought you didn't drink.<eos> For the most part, I don't.
Okay, come on.<eos> Let's go, please.<eos> - Which way?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> - I thought you said you counted the doors.<eos> - It wasn't like this before.<eos> There's someone back here, Jonah.<eos> Pick away.<eos> I don't know.<eos> She does.
Wait, wait. Where are we going?<eos> You don't know, either.<eos> We're going this way, Mac, okay?<eos> So I can get a signal on my phone and I can call the police.<eos> So I can tell them that two of my friends are dead.<eos> We don't know if that one guy is actually dead.<eos> "One guy"? His name is Rand, man.<eos> Rand.<eos> He's been my best friend for, like, 15 years and you don't even know his name.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm going to New York one day.<eos> And to London, Tokyo, Paris.<eos> What?<eos> People will write books go to those places, right?<eos> Martin's sure gonna miss you, Vera.<eos> - Shut your face, Gitty!<eos> - Martin, watch your mouth.<eos> Martin, this chicken's delicious.<eos> - Where'd you buy it?<eos> - I didn't.
Doctors! Millionaires!<eos> You've got choices!<eos> That's the perk of the internet!<eos> Nanami was never adventurous.<eos> When she took a liking to azuki bread, that was all she ate.<eos> Then I suppose she'll never get tired of my boy either.<eos> I'll say!<eos> She'll adore him forever.<eos> You want to continue teaching after marriage?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'll give you a discount as Ramba Ral's friend.<eos> How about $3,000 total?<eos> No more, no less.<eos> That's still expensive.<eos> You can pay me in installments.<eos> A little bit at a time.<eos> For Ramba Ral.<eos> Do you like chocolates?<eos> What?<eos> Yes, I do.
Meredith, do whatever you can to get the database up and running.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Our murder scene is much bloodier than the original cases.<eos> More spatter.<eos> Maybe St. Valentine drugged his male victims.<eos> That would explain the cleaner crime scenes.<eos> Except none of those men had drugs in their system.<eos> How in the world?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But, maybe this guy does.
She lent me that tooth.<eos> And as for your other unfounded accusation, I have an alibi for last night.<eos> I was with a writer, getting advice on self-publishing.<eos> Self-publishing what?<eos> I am writing the completely true story of the St. Valentine murders.<eos> And what's your version of the completely true story?<eos> The police...<eos> Got the wrong guy.<eos> And I assume you have proof to back that up.<eos> I do.
Except the blood evidence isn't.<eos> In the old crime scenes the blood was pooled.<eos> Too much spatter here.<eos> St. Valentine was surgical.<eos> New killer is no expert with the knife.<eos> There's something missing.<eos> Bruising around the neck.<eos> Right?<eos> Your guy doesn't have any.<eos> All our male victims did.
Totally sappy.<eos> Got something.<eos> What you got me?<eos> Back in 1994, the hotline got an anonymous tip on a guy living in a house at 115 Conyer Street.<eos> So did they follow it up?<eos> No, because two hours later they caught Glen Baker.<eos> And the case was closed.<eos> Or so they thought. What're you getting at?<eos> Tax rolls show a Wayne Lewis owned the house back in 1994.<eos> Still does.
You want to invite her over Sunday night?<eos> No.<eos> Is everything okay with you two?<eos> I never should have gone to that school.<eos> Leyland?<eos> It's a good school.<eos> It's gonna help you get into college.<eos> Is everything okay with you and Evy?<eos> I don't want to go back to that place.<eos> I don't.
Do you know -- you know -- unh-unh, no, no.<eos> Do you know...<eos> How hard it was to get you into that school?<eos> I mean, do you -- do you understand how much it takes out of this house? !<eos> And you get kicked out for doing something stupid? !<eos> I mean, what -- what were you doing? !<eos> I... I-I don't know.<eos> You do know.<eos> No.<eos> You do!
He's a widely respected source with connections...<eos> He's a fucking rent-a-quote.<eos> I know you really wrote the Birch story, and I think I know why you chose to hide that fact.<eos> If I am such a careerist, why would I ever hide something that good?<eos> 'Cause you thought it would endear you to someone.<eos> What you should have done, if you were really playing an elevated game, was come to me with what you had.<eos> See, if I had something better to give you in exchange for you holding on to it...<eos> You have never been willing to play any kind of game with me.<eos> I didn't know you were ready to play in the bigs, man.<eos> Now I do.
I know plenty about how Axe Capital works... The dirty edge... The proprietary trading techniques.<eos> I know how the secret sauce is made.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sure you could put out a Schott's miscellany about the place.<eos> Schott's?<eos> It's like a farmer's almanac for non-farm stuff.<eos> Then, yeah, I could put out a couple of volumes of Schott's miscellany about the place.<eos> You just need to ask yourself one question first...<eos> Are you rich enough to never get another job?<eos> I did work for that man.
Please, Catherine, stop with the whining, all right?<eos> You're gonna shatter the bulletproof glass in here.<eos> How is it that we did not win Delaware?<eos> Okay, is that a yes to my question?<eos> Okay, she can have full access, okay?<eos> Starting right after we address the situation in Yemen.<eos> Honey, it's Yemen.<eos> Life gives you Yemen, you got to make Yemenade.<eos> Okay, well, I'll come back later.<eos> You always do.
Excuse me.<eos> Is this the New York Employment Center?<eos> I'm only finding day labor work.<eos> I need something permanent.<eos> We have just the thing for you.<eos> So you know, I have a record, but...<eos> Yes, we have that information.<eos> That's not an issue.<eos> The position's yours if you want it.<eos> And you do.
We're good.<eos> Our supervisor will be right with you.<eos> That was Harry.<eos> I gathered.<eos> He think I'm the reason his cover's blown?<eos> He knows you're not.<eos> He slipped up.<eos> He went back to the place he and Grace had their first date.<eos> Harold has a weakness.<eos> We all do.
What?<eos> I don't want to kill anyone.<eos> You got this all wrong.<eos> My friend caught you running out of the party.<eos> - Seem suspicious?<eos> - A bomb went off.<eos> I think running was the appropriate reaction.<eos> How long have you known Logan Pierce?<eos> The Friendczar guy?<eos> I don't.
I like it!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah! Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I thought you would.<eos> More refined right?<eos> Yeah, I just wanted to have something that had a little bit more of a classic feeling bar.<eos> You know?<eos> Something that doesn't necessarily rely on a theme or anything like that.<eos> Well it has a theme.<eos> No it doesn't.
Only wish the songs were better.<eos> When we were kids back in school...<eos> Every year they would have this short story contest in the spring.<eos> And Gloria here, would always win Always!<eos> Oh come on my stories were terrible.<eos> Oh yeah well...<eos> I know they were better than mine, so...<eos> I'm going to get more booze.<eos> I didn't know that you wanted to be a writer.<eos> No, I didn't...
- Does it mean a hundred people?<eos> - Gloria, you got to calm down.<eos> - Does it mean 200 people? - Gloria...<eos> - What is "not many" mean?<eos> I gotta tell someone. I gotta tell somebody.<eos> Hey, you gotta calm down.<eos> I gotta turn myself in and I gotta...<eos> No, hold on. I gotta tell how it could happen.<eos> Yeah, but you don't know what happened. - Yes, I do.<eos> Yes, I do.
You know that I love you? -Yes.<eos> And I you.<eos> -I am terribly sorry.<eos> -For what?<eos> -Because we never talked about it.<eos> -About what?<eos> I do not understand.<eos> -You know.<eos> -No, I do not.<eos> Yes you do.
Nothing?<eos> No, you're exaggerating.<eos> Please, stop.<eos> I do not believe you!<eos> Why are you so upset?<eos> We do not need the money anymore.<eos> Have you noticed that our life has changed?<eos> I make movies now.<eos> Soon, we can handle ourselves. It will be like old times.<eos> We do not even André.
How're we feeling?<eos> Great.<eos> Can you take her to the lake?<eos> You ok?<eos> I wanna head back today.<eos> Tell me what's up.<eos> I think this place is making me worse.<eos> We'll go home after lunch.<eos> Who wants to skip some stones?<eos> I do!
What are you doing?<eos> Looking for you.<eos> But I'm right here.<eos> Were you singing?<eos> The fairy song.<eos> Where'd you hear it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is important.<eos> Where'd you hear that song? I don't know.<eos> Of course you do!
Like what?<eos> Well, it'd have to be our secret.<eos> Can you keep a secret?<eos> It's nothing much, just a game.<eos> They told me not to play with you.<eos> Who did?<eos> No one.<eos> Who would say something mean like that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
- I was trying... - You lied about the note because you were worried I would be hurt by her choice of words?<eos> She disappeared.<eos> And you thought that's what I would have on my mind?<eos> If she left a note, the police wouldn't even have looked for her.<eos> I just thought... We should have made that decision... together.<eos> It all... It all happened because I chose her.<eos> You wanted to adopt that little boy, but... I wanted her.<eos> I thought because she was blind, she would need me forever.<eos> I needed her... to love me.<eos> I just did.
I decide when I tell my parents or Levi, or you.<eos> Me, not you.<eos> Have you told Levi or your parents?<eos> Yes?<eos> What the fuck, dude?<eos> You're taking this way out of proportion.<eos> I think this shows that I care about you the most.<eos> I was the most worried to tell you.<eos> Does that not mean anything to you?<eos> No, it doesn't.
I don't fucking care.<eos> Where's MacKenzie?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She has diarrhea or something.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - I can save her.<eos> Get the fuck out.<eos> Hey, not while you have diarrhea.<eos> I don't have diarrhea.<eos> I don't.
- Oh, yes, the short-tempered fellow.<eos> - I suppose.<eos> Um, this is gonna sound fucking crazy but we think a game killed a friend of ours.<eos> I don't have another way to explain - once the game begins, only two paths exist.<eos> Completion and death.<eos> - Can you tell me anything else about the game?<eos> - Mm, very little I'm afraid.<eos> Only a scant number have played it but, uh, every few years or so, it always ends up back here.<eos> - Uh, why do they return it?<eos> - They don't.
Previously on Rogue...<eos> Shit.<eos> - Did you actually see her shoot him?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Right.<eos> Why don't you go to sleep?<eos> You're fine.<eos> When all is said and done, they work for you.<eos> Channel 3 news isn't running it, Channel 4 hasn't mentioned it in an hour.<eos> Maybe it's run its course.<eos> Doesn't look like it's getting any traction.<eos> Maybe, maybe, we just maybe, have beaten this thing.<eos> Ah. Don't you think it's a little early for that?<eos> No, I do not.
That's great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Parker Hershorn is, uh... Does that name ring a bell to you?<eos> - No.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Yes, I'm sure.<eos> But what the hell does it matter?<eos> I mean, really, Ethan, what is your angle here?<eos> That Gary finished up his spreadsheets and then they sent him over here to blow me away?<eos> You done?
There's actually a lot of weird instances where the first lady and the president don't even sleep in the same bedroom, which is...<eos> People don't...<eos> Excuse me for one moment.<eos> What the hell? You cannot just interrupt a class like that.<eos> She needs answers.<eos> Come here.<eos> All right. Do I know you?<eos> Oh, yeah. Um...<eos> I really liked your poem.<eos> No, he didn't.
Really late.<eos> It won't matter if we're in jail.<eos> We're not stopping.<eos> Not for anything.<eos> He's not someone who accepts excuses very well.<eos> Mystery Man's got to see how committed we are.<eos> Right?<eos> Especially after what we did.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Yeah, he does.
- Maybe they did if they had help.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Oh, for fuck's sake. You...<eos> Tell you what.<eos> You can just collectively all go fuck yourselves.<eos> You're just gonna let him walk out of here, Commander?<eos> - In a word, yes.<eos> - Harley Cohen is at the very least a person of interest in this investigation.<eos> Don't you think it would be prudent to hold him for further questioning?<eos> I do not. Ah.
Diane and me? That should not ask me.<eos> Do not put her in that position.<eos> - I do not, but you.<eos> Maybe I was overreacting.<eos> We have until Tuesday to decide? I will think about it.<eos> Coralie, call Lefort and confirm the hearing.<eos> Magnesium.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Try magnesium for palpebral tremors.<eos> Okay. Did you do anything?
Maybe he is!<eos> It's Max.<eos> I have to tell him.<eos> Do not forget dessert!<eos> I'm talking phone Timo Atanen, really.<eos> Crazy, huh?<eos> What you did was amazing.<eos> I did not do much.<eos> - Anyway.<eos> He did it himself, with his own arguments.
It just... I don't know. You don't know what it's like.<eos> I, um...<eos> I was supposed to... my dad by the time he was my age, he had a master's degree and, like, five medals from the Navy.<eos> And I get coffee.<eos> You do more than that, Clark.<eos> Yeah, sometimes I get donuts.<eos> I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street. Fuck 'em.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.
Chairman Mao says that a calm heart stills all panic.<eos> Screw Chairman Mao.<eos> You... you and I will be in prison.<eos> Chairman Mao will be in his palace eating spare ribs.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> If I wind up in prison, I am never gonna take a shower.<eos> I can promise you one thing, that she will not be here long.<eos> Yeah, meanwhile, her accomplice was captured.<eos> You know, thank God the guy doesn't know where she is.<eos> Um, he... he does.
No, I'm not. I'm really not kidding you.<eos> I found something that I love, that I really love, and there's so much that I have to learn, and I want to learn it.<eos> More than anything, I want to learn it.<eos> Well, that's a beautiful sentiment, but when have you ever stuck to a single thing?<eos> You can't expect me to sink my money into another whim.<eos> - Well, it's not your money.<eos> - It takes a certain passion to see things through and you've never had that. Maybe it's because Mum was always easy on you or your face is so symmetrical, but it's left you soft.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm sorry to be the one to tell you things that you don't want to hear, but I know you, Jessa. I know you.<eos> No, you don't.

And you witnessed the entire incident?<eos> - And he didn't kill our man?<eos> - No, it was a frontiersman.<eos> I didn't see his face.<eos> The boy's entirely innocent of the crime, that one, at least.<eos> Well, thank you for coming to us.<eos> It's my duty, Milord.<eos> Clearly the boy has value to you?<eos> Did you see where he went?<eos> No, I didn't, no.
You're my rapacious scumbag.<eos> This is what love is.<eos> They put me on fucking hold?<eos> Yeah, a man of your stature.<eos> Damn right.<eos> Man of my imperious...<eos> You ready to sweet talk me?<eos> Statue of Liberty bombing attempt.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
You know what?<eos> It is freezing in here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Is the heat on?<eos> Only in summer.<eos> Mr. Johnson's not so good about getting it fixed.<eos> I think you need to see a doctor.<eos> I'll be right back. Okay?<eos> You watch over your mother.<eos> I do.
Room 210.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No good. No, prime.<eos> No.<eos> He needs a prime number.<eos> - Something like 607. - No, really, that's fine.<eos> Don't need a prime number.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Yes... no, we do.
Go and find your purpose.<eos> You do have one.<eos> One that's right.<eos> Just go.<eos> Leave all this behind.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're here to shoot me again?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know anything about them.<eos> I never did.
Take pre-emptive action.<eos> Attack them until they cannot fight back.<eos> I'd rather have them all dead, than let one escape.<eos> Boss!<eos> We've got 300 security enforcements.<eos> They're ready to set off any time.<eos> We'll shutting down Rue-Ian's secret laboratory.<eos> No one can get in anymore.<eos> Now, do you believe me?<eos> Now I do.
Freddy!<eos> Hey, what's up, brother?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, jump on.<eos> Jump on.<eos> - I'll be there in a sec.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Have to talk about the Cross-Co. short.<eos> I didn't understand the play when you had me make it.<eos> Now I do.
Wait.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Close your eyes, Dr. Wilkes.<eos> Shut out everything else and just embrace what you hear.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> First things first.<eos> Peggy Carter paid me a visit today.<eos> And what did you say?<eos> Well, she did most of the talking.
That's... not code.<eos> These are design specifications.<eos> H-Howard Stark wants me to build a machine.<eos> You?<eos> It says that?<eos> Well, no, but you see someone else here who can?<eos> What does the machine do?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> A cannon.<eos> Something to do with gamma radiation.
He's smart.<eos> He's competent, driven, funny... And so in love with his wife that... he doesn't see her for what she is.<eos> Was that the first time that you'd seen someone die?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The people that you've gotten involved with are not who they appear to be.<eos> These kinds of movements prey on idealists like you.<eos> You want to make a difference, but they will use you and cast you aside.<eos> They will destroy your life without conscience.<eos> You're wondering if you have a choice.<eos> You don't.
Didn't she almost rip your dick off?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> Jackhammer Jillian.<eos> She was like... I was like...<eos> Bitch was crazy.<eos> I remember the pictures you sent me.<eos> You got a big-ass dick.<eos> I'm kinda jealous.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I want Chartwell to feel like a family home again.<eos> Somewhere to catch him when he realises he won't be going back to Downing Street.<eos> What I care about now is peace above all.<eos> A time of peace.<eos> "What I care about now is peace above all, a time of peace."<eos> - Do we have to do this again? - Yes, we do.<eos> I've lived a life like a man who has pursued peace.<eos> - Have you got that?<eos> - Yes, you're a man who's pursued peace.<eos> Like a ferret does a rabbit.
All right.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Thank you, Yellow Pages.<eos> Hey, Chips, look.<eos> I found this in a drugstore.<eos> You want it?<eos> You know, it's a bit ugly, but maybe you'll like it.<eos> It looks good with your beard.<eos> Oh, I like that a lot.<eos> - Huh? - I do, yeah.
I was trying to let you know something.<eos> Can I just go urinate, please?<eos> Easter.<eos> Please.<eos> Give me a little break.<eos> Ohh. Actually, can I...<eos> I really need to go to the bathroom, okay?<eos> He doesn't need to go to the bathroom.<eos> - I do need to go to the...<eos> - He doesn't.
I'm less sure.<eos> But... y-yes.<eos> Somewhat.<eos> There are invisible presences... around us, always. Whether or not they're the souls of the dead, I don't know, but... When you're a medium, you just are attuned to a certain... vibe.<eos> What do you mean by, vibe?<eos> It's an intuition thing.<eos> You see this door... It's only like slightly ajar.<eos> I also this that... the soul... continues to exist after death.<eos> I don't really know if I believe in that.<eos> But Lewis did.
I feel like she's sick of me already or something, you know?<eos> It's like, this happens all the time.<eos> It's like, I meet somebody, and then they like me initially, and then I just, like, fuck it up and they get tired of me or something, you know?<eos> It's like, you know, you're, like, my only friend, who, like, grew into liking me, seriously.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Okay, that's true.<eos> But you were like... When I met you, you were like... - You were like...<eos> What's your major?"<eos> I didn't say that all the time.<eos> Yeah, you did.
I love you.<eos> See, Desi, that's a major part of the problem.<eos> That you don't seem to care at all about what I want.<eos> - Oh, I don't care what you want? - Yeah, you don't care. Would you prefer that I just pretend nothing's wrong with me?<eos> - and how much I love you?<eos> - That sounds really positive to me.<eos> - I think that'd make you happy, too. - Oh, Jesus.<eos> - No.<eos> - Whoa. You know you just recoiled<eos> - from my touch? - I didn't.
You need to evacuate immediately.<eos> Do you recognize the voice on that recording, Mr. Asher?<eos> Elias Harper.<eos> He blew up Grand Central, and then, four days later, he blew up the FBI's emergency command center.<eos> And do you believe Elias Harper acted alone?<eos> Let me remind you we are an impartial committee, and it's important the views you express here today are yours and yours alone.<eos> I'll ask again...<eos> Do you believe Elias Harper acted alone?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I do.
I thought you said this guy was the best.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, he is.<eos> That's why he's so damn expensive.<eos> Well, I want to meet this guy, man.<eos> Enough of this fucking middle man shit.<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'll just, uh, I'll just him on the phone here.<eos> Of course, it's going to cost you 100 bucks whether he picks up or not.<eos> 200 if he does.
The meeting's going to be another 600.<eos> You've got to be fucking kidding me! No, no, no.<eos> I've got his number around here somewhere.<eos> Fuck it! Don't... Just fuck it.<eos> Yeah...<eos> I'm not paying that kind of money.<eos> It's like getting stabbed in the tea bag with a butter knife, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, but who knows?<eos> You know, he might still come up with something.<eos> Yeah, what if he doesn't?
Oh, God.<eos> The fuck are you talking about?<eos> I was out.<eos> It took everything in my soul, everything I had in my fucking soul, to leave.<eos> And you pulled me back again, Julian.<eos> Julian: I didn't pull you back in!<eos> Julian, you pulled me back in.<eos> Mr. Lahey!<eos> I've been living a lie, saying that I don't need you.<eos> But I do.
Water.<eos> What's for dinner?<eos> My special dhal and rice.<eos> - Can I give him one?<eos> - Not before dinner.<eos> - Oh, shit!<eos> - What have you done?<eos> - I broke the ring pull.<eos> - Don't know your own strength.<eos> No, I don't.
- See that shit?<eos> - Can we get back to the car before you start Marty Steining?<eos> No.<eos> That.<eos> You think your boys grabbed the footage?<eos> Put in a call to Delsanto.<eos> Lucky, man!<eos> - Just like something...<eos> - Give it again...<eos> Do it again, huh!
"The Konis Dancers."<eos> You should have gone.<eos> No way!<eos> No way!<eos> OK?<eos> You back at the estate?<eos> Yeah, Maimouna...<eos> It's me.<eos> I wanted to tell you I did it.<eos> I did it!
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.<eos> Didn't even get to finish my breakfast.<eos> All of those new smells are driving me crazy.<eos> I gotta go check it out.<eos> Where are you going, Scrubby?<eos> Come back!<eos> It's not safe out there.<eos> Can't let all those tasty mussels get washed away.<eos> If I recall correctly didn't Mac say we should all stay out of sight.<eos> He did.
Their queen wants Clarke's power.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Wanheda...<eos> A prisoner for our Queen.<eos> Hello, Clarke.<eos> What part of "I won't see you" was unclear?<eos> I respected your wishes for a week, Clarke.<eos> We've got bigger concerns.<eos> "We" don't have any concerns at all.<eos> Yes, we do.
You have done everything you can.<eos> No.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> I let this happen.<eos> I demanded an election... and now we have Chancellor Pike.<eos> We're on the brink of a war we can't win, and all I can do to stop it is send kids into harm's way.<eos> Hey, in case you haven't noticed, they're not kids anymore.<eos> With Clarke gone, Bellamy's the key.<eos> I've been trying to reach him, but Pike's influence is strong, and he really believes he's doing the right thing.<eos> Everybody always does.
Your kill order must be fully enforced.<eos> If you care for Clarke, you will send her home.<eos> It is the only way that she will be safe.<eos> Don't make her pay the price for your mistakes as Costia did.<eos> My mistakes?<eos> Azgeda cut off Costia's head and delivered it to my bed, and still I let them into my alliance.<eos> I'm more than capable of separating feelings from duty.<eos> I'm sorry, Lexa.<eos> I didn't mean to offend you.<eos> Yes, you did...
That is the law.<eos> Did you know what your husband was?<eos> No.<eos> Eight summers ago, I had a child with a man.<eos> He...<eos> He used to beat us.<eos> Koll saved us.<eos> He took my daughter as his own.<eos> We came back to my home, here, to Herot, but I never knew what he was.<eos> I never did!
That's why Ant-Man went solo again.<eos> That's why we canceled our Avengers expansion plans.<eos> I still think we should be meeting more often.<eos> But why?<eos> Each of us are heroes with our own jobs, our own lives, our own problems to deal with. No joke.<eos> Smashing can be a full-time job.<eos> Point is, since there's nothing threatening the world right now,<eos> I'm gonna adjourn the...<eos> - Friday, do we have a gavel?<eos> - You do now.
We need that jacket back.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> You shooting a scene with it or something, or...<eos> - No.<eos> - Well... can't I keep wearing it?<eos> Just let me wear it a little longer.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Everyone does.
- Yeah.<eos> - ...that kind of played, right?<eos> Yeah, I like that character going dark.<eos> - Actually, it works for us.<eos> - Right.<eos> You know where we could use her?<eos> We could use her in the graveyard scene with Arya.<eos> - Oh, yeah. That makes sense.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It does.
I don't want it to smell bad.<eos> - Yeah. - That's a bad first start.<eos> What else we got here, uh...<eos> - Guys, Gus is coming over... - soon.<eos> Yay. - Who's Gus?<eos> - He's this guy I think I might be into...<eos> - Do you have butterflies?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I have butterflies, and I have a heart murmur, and I got the Hershey squirts.<eos> - But I thought you liked him.<eos> - I do. I do.
A player piano.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> That's playing on its own.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> That's Irma.<eos> She's, like, the resident piano-playing ghost.<eos> - Cool! - Uh-huh.<eos> Hey, let's go stalk that, uh, super excited lady.<eos> No, you should ask her to play a song.<eos> - She does anything.
Shall I go?<eos> If you come home early sleep outside!<eos> So you learned how to cook?<eos> Yes, completely!<eos> - Hi Kabir! - Hi Neha<eos> - How's Kia?<eos> - She's good. Very good<eos> When 2 people have a scene in college... and they lose touch... and meet after many years... that moment guys...<eos> is pure sex!<eos> Here! Sex done?
Different life story.<eos> Take this and that one there.<eos> Anything?<eos> He says that's where they were holding her, and that's all he knows.<eos> Swears he knows nothing about Patrick.<eos> - You talked to CPD? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I had a conversation with his lieutenant, went through all his case files.<eos> There's nothing in there that should've put him anywhere near those Russians.<eos> It doesn't make any sense...<eos> Sometimes it doesn't.
What about Greg Barrett?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Greg Barrett...<eos> What were you doing in his apartment the other day?<eos> Well, he's a client.<eos> What'd he hire you for?<eos> Well, that's confidential.<eos> I can't find my partner, Patrick Finnegan.<eos> Do you know anything about that?<eos> - No, I don't.
'Cause Melanie says a leopard don't change his spots and a man don't change his ways.<eos> Well, Melanie's man ain't this man.<eos> I was thinking maybe we could take Eli to the zoo this Saturday.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yeah, whatever you want.<eos> Okay. Then I'll get Crystal to watch him<eos> - and maybe we can go dancing?<eos> - Dancing?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - What we gonna do, Nae Nae?
-What about me?<eos> -You don't wear pants.<eos> You are a selfish cocksucker, you know that?<eos> Yes, I know I'm a selfish cocksucker.<eos> "I was scared, Bets!<eos> "I didn't want the big, bad Russians to hurt me."<eos> Well, fuck you!<eos> All these years, I've taken care of you.<eos> I don't know what you want.<eos> What do you...
Uh, it... it suited me.<eos> I-I like to travel, see new places and... meet new people.<eos> But, I mean, you choose a job before you really know if you'll like it, right?<eos> I mean, when you're young, you don't... know anything... who you are, what you wanna do, be.<eos> You pick something because it fits what you like, what... what you need.<eos> But life changes things, you change, or... or something.<eos> And then one day you wake up, and you don't want to go into the office.<eos> You don't wanna make arrangements for people you don't know and don't give a shit about.<eos> You... You don't wanna do it.<eos> You just don't.
(Sighing) This is fucking killing me right now not going with these guys.<eos> There's no better feeling doing a Bamp; E, reaping' off some dumb-dumb idiot.<eos> Hit off that?<eos> No? Anyway, I'm lucky Lucy's stayed with me this long.<eos> And I can't risk losing my family again.<eos> Right now I'm doing nothing wrong.<eos> Just waiting for my pizzas to cook.<eos> Nothing illegal about that.<eos> And it's not a lie if you believe it's not happening.<eos> And I do.
Doesn't take much.<eos> Come on.<eos> Spontaneous weddings are pretty fucking romantic.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> When?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This weekend?<eos> Might as well.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I don't...
There's nothing in the classroom as far as I can tell.<eos> Well, maybe Jason was lying.<eos> Maybe he uploaded the files and destroyed the physical copies.<eos> We've got both brothers' computers, going through them now.<eos> So that's it?<eos> We're just gonna give up, hope for the best?<eos> Hey, you got any better ideas, Einstein?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want to talk to Jason again.<eos> You already did.
Come on, man, don't worry about it.<eos> Get it done, Reed.<eos> Hey, Mr. Edwards, hold up.<eos> So, I heard you got laid off from your job at the Times.<eos> - How did you hear that?<eos> - I asked around.<eos> Look...<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> - No, you don't know anything.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Whoa! Why'd you pull me back?<eos> Some new kids were just about to give me a chance.<eos> Don't try anything new, son.<eos> I could've married a woman who didn't look exactly like me.<eos> But that would've been crazy.<eos> Hey, newbie.<eos> Nobody touches the new James Patterson until Solar reads it first.<eos> She wants you to pick it up.<eos> You scared, huh? Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Uh, I do.
He's so...<eos> He's so pink.<eos> - Where is he now?<eos> - He encountered the sleeping one.<eos> - They appear to be travelling together.<eos> - Good.<eos> - But where are they going?<eos> - Uh, I don't know, Your Majesty.<eos> You said to announce it at once if the outlander arrived.<eos> And, well, he did...
You bonded with a gang banger?<eos> They could've killed you.<eos> Those guys are criminals. They need to be put behind bars.<eos> They're only trying to survive the only way they know how.<eos> I mean, do you really want to clog the courts with a couple of dope dealers when there are serial rapists out there?<eos> -Howdy, stranger!<eos> -Hey, hey!<eos> Trudy!<eos> -How'd you know I was in the neighborhood?<eos> I didn't.

Late.<eos> What do you do, by the way?<eos> We kind of skipped over this small talk last time.<eos> Investment management.<eos> Super dull. But, pays the bills.<eos> I imagine it pays 'em quite adequately.<eos> Yeah, I suppose it does.<eos> Look, why don't you call whoever you have to call and just tell 'em you're clocking out.<eos> You don't want to bring your NetCar driver to have drinks with your clients.<eos> But I do. I do.
We're in the car. We followed him here.<eos> Okay, do not go in there.<eos> Stay away from the motel. I'll send a unit right over.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> -They're on their way.<eos> -Was in my car.<eos> Was in my car!<eos> Gave me coffee. Had to know it was me.<eos> Maybe didn't.
- Trudy!<eos> ♪ Trudy, come on.<eos> - One good bounce, you'll blow your pecker straight off.<eos> [chuckles] You're like a real bandito now.<eos> - Just shut up.<eos> You've already gotten me in enough trouble.<eos> - My heart bleeds.<eos> - Shut up, all of you.<eos> - Who's got the money?<eos> - I do, some of it.
If this is a trick, it won't end well for you.<eos> My people are in trouble.<eos> They don't... we don't have a lot of fighters.<eos> I know how it looks, but I'll play it out.<eos> Can I borrow a gun?<eos> No. We got tracks right here.<eos> They gotta be in there.<eos> We moving in or what?<eos> How do we know this ain't firecrackers in a trash can?<eos> You don't.
You need things.<eos> We need things.<eos> What, are you gonna give us a bottle of aspirin and a box of bullets?<eos> Our communities can help each other.<eos> Thank you, Natalie. Been a good talk.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> We're doing fine.<eos> Are you?<eos> We want to generate trade.<eos> Gregory does.
Yeah.<eos> So, you know what you're fighting for.<eos> Hmm. Honeypot.<eos> They're in trouble.<eos> Stay here.<eos> - I'm going with you. - I said stay here.<eos> No.<eos> Damn it, Maggie.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - No, you don't.
Mitch.<eos> I snapped.<eos> What?<eos> I killed him.<eos> I know there's a lot stuff going on but just talk about this.<eos> I'll come get you.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Mitch, just slow down, buddy.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Do what you do.
Go on, try.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - I'll help you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Stop it.<eos> It hurts.<eos> Stop!<eos> Please...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Did you accept it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My parents are so proud.<eos> What about Alexandre?<eos> If I accept the job, that's not the issue.<eos> Did you tell him?<eos> - We don't talk much.<eos> - Oh?<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.

Just said she was in a rush and to give her the deposit.<eos> See that thumbprint?<eos> Yours.<eos> Now, why was there broken glass?<eos> I was frustrated.<eos> She was all over the place.<eos> She wouldn't tell me why.<eos> I was just making a point and...<eos> How did you know it was my print?<eos> Oh, I didn't, pet.
It can be intimidating and exhausting.<eos> Are you getting enough sleep?<eos> - I will make sure of it.<eos> - No, you know what's exhausting?<eos> Sleeping on a closet floor with an innocent child who was kept in a bunker for 10 years.<eos> Tell me what color you want me to wear, I'll wear it.<eos> She's a little on edge, but when the time comes, she will knock it out of the park.<eos> The time is tomorrow.<eos> If you want our endorsement and our money, we need to feel confident that she'll toe the party line.<eos> And right now, we don't.
I don't talk about them and you can't.<eos> No exceptions.<eos> Given we are a new branch of science, there's no standard scale for fees, so I charge 10 shillings per session.<eos> As much as a visit to a halfway-decent dentist.<eos> So you can come see me or get your teeth fixed.<eos> Your choice.<eos> Why are you scratching your hand?<eos> Why were you doing that?<eos> I had an itch.<eos> No, you didn't.
Got room on the undercard now, thanks to you.<eos> So, I came down to see what you can do.<eos> Thanks, but I'm done for today.<eos> Hey. Hold on, be right back.<eos> Hey, what the...<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> What the hell are you doin', man?<eos> What's your problem?<eos> Do you know who that guy is?<eos> Do you?
Or someone wanting to wreck Peter's Cicely Day celebrations.<eos> Brothers at war?<eos> Let me know what Cam has to say about your find.<eos> I'm going to speak to a lady about a tractor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Leave it with me, I'll see what I can do.<eos> Oh... by the way, when's the big match?<eos> Last night.<eos> Oh... I take it your new opponent won.<eos> No, I did.
Well, let's leave that to the lawyers.<eos> Let me save you some breath.<eos> Now the Attorney General thinks it best that my office drop its pursuit of Axe Capital.<eos> And you tried to argue with her, but she was insistent.<eos> Kids would hashtag that "one hundred."<eos> Any matter related to Axe Capital is to be handled by the Eastern District from here forward.<eos> You know, the only thing I can't figure is if the AG's fear of negative publicity is because she's planning a Senate run or a return to the private sector.<eos> Put on a blindfold, spin yourself around, and pin the tail on the donkey.<eos> - You know?<eos> - I do.
Okay.<eos> Sorry, your bullshit Satanic tourism, - I have to take this seriously?<eos> - It's not Satanic tourism, it's about understanding the dark natures.<eos> Wow, that's very Aleister Crowley of you.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck you, David.<eos> If you didn't wanna do this, why'd you come?<eos> To get a BJ.<eos> Hey, I've got that department covered.<eos> Oh, do you?
Truth time.<eos> Bruce Mindhorn became the best plainclothes detective the Isle of Man had ever seen.<eos> Out the way! Coming...<eos> Coming through!<eos> Oh, God, no.<eos> Jasmine, I'm sorry.<eos> What for?<eos> Everything.<eos> You know about me and your mother and who I am.<eos> Yes, yes, sadly I do.
Whereabouts at Pat's?<eos> In the garage.<eos> In the glove compartment of the Mindhorn car.<eos> - What have you got the gun for?<eos> - You know too much, Richard.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I'm actually quite confused.<eos> You know that I killed Moncrief, right?<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Well, you do now.
Previously in "The 100"...<eos> Let the people know they have a new Commander.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> - No one knows that.<eos> - He does.
You don't get to ask me that.<eos> What more do I have to do to prove that I am on your side?<eos> Bring Lincoln back.<eos> Turning Pike in does not make you one of the good guys, Bellamy.<eos> You did that to save me, not because what you thought Pike was doing to the Grounders was wrong.<eos> The Grounders were starving us out.<eos> Because you massacred an army that was sent to protect us.<eos> That army could've attacked us at any time, and you know it.<eos> But they didn't attack.<eos> You did that.
You're an epic dick, Murphy.<eos> Everybody take your seats. Now!<eos> I'm sure all of you will be glad to know that we are officially done talking about Earth skills.<eos> Oh, great. In that case...<eos> Sit down.<eos> How would you feel about assisting me with today's lesson, Mr. Murphy?<eos> Sign me up.<eos> What the hell was that fo...<eos> I know all about you, John Murphy.<eos> - Ah, you do, huh? - Yeah.
Are you Protestant or Catholic?<eos> I'm Catholic.<eos> Catholic.<eos> And the rite?<eos> The Abramelin.<eos> You're not fuckin' about.<eos> No.<eos> I've done this three times.<eos> Once it worked, twice it didn't.<eos> It didn't?
It is.<eos> You get to ask for what you want too.<eos> How much do you want it?<eos> More than anything.<eos> I'm having the bedroom with the bed in it.<eos> You will cook and clean.<eos> You do know what we're takin' on?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you know the dangers?<eos> I do.
Don't forget what I'm doing for you.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> You can serve yourself, I'm not fucking hungry.<eos> But I told you, didn't I?<eos> This is the way that it works.<eos> It's two, three passes at it.<eos> It's a cycle, I said at the beginning.<eos> - I'm not doing it again.<eos> - But you've got no choice.<eos> I do.
Right.<eos> I don't know what the hell you are, angel doll, but you're one tasty treat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you like to help me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Anything.<eos> Could you tell me where to find the Mortal Cup?<eos> I wish I could... but I don't know.<eos> Clary knows.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Sun's gonna come up soon.<eos> Remember how to use the blade?<eos> Keep your arms steady and don't overestimate what you know.<eos> They can be tricky.<eos> We'll try and keep them off you as much as we can.<eos> Where are Alec and Isabelle?<eos> Being distracting.<eos> You're really not gonna talk to me, are you?<eos> That's because you have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> But I do.
Multiple homicides.<eos> The chief suspect is a U.S. Army captain who's been smuggling heroin from Vietnam in the caskets of dead soldiers.<eos> What does that have to do with me?<eos> You're in here because you have evidence that the Army is lying to the American people.<eos> What if I bust a murderous, dope-smuggling, decorated Army captain who's been lying to the Army?<eos> They'd bury it.<eos> Deeper than me.<eos> Or maybe I hold on to that officer, and maybe the government gets the message that they should cut a deal with you or else the arresting officer, your father, will hold a big nasty press conference.<eos> Dad... These people... you don't want to do this.<eos> No, I don't.
All right, man.<eos> All right.<eos> You should get a job making people nervous.<eos> No, I will.<eos> I-I-I just got some stuff.<eos> You know?<eos> Some lyrics and whatnot.<eos> - You understand.<eos> - No, yeah, yeah.<eos> I do.
All right.<eos> You should get a job making people nervous.<eos> No, I will.<eos> I-I-I just got some stuff.<eos> You know?<eos> Some lyrics and whatnot.<eos> - You understand.<eos> - No, yeah, yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> I do, for sure.
- Does Harris love you?<eos> - Yeah, of course he does.<eos> So you don't have any secrets?<eos> No.<eos> None.<eos> Good.<eos> So, let's talk about what happened to your old bunkmate Jamie Thorne.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Jodie told you where I was.<eos> Oh, my mistake, pet, so she did.
It's just words.<eos> They mean very little.<eos> I'm willing to back them up with action.<eos> First, we should talk about a bailout.<eos> I'm willing to work with the IMF to get you what you need.<eos> And second, as a gesture of good faith, we'd like to return Igor Milkin to Russia.<eos> You should've done so already.<eos> I need your assurances he'll get a trial.<eos> - What do you care about Igor Milkin?<eos> - I don't.
Every cent it goes up is another six points on the anger index.<eos> We predict that $7 a gallon will get you riots.<eos> What about the First Lady?<eos> Oh, she's faring better than he is.<eos> Sympathy for the sick mother.<eos> Thanks for the rush job on this.<eos> Well, you're a friend.<eos> And this is far more interesting than... testing names of anti-depressants for five-year-olds, or... what color cross trainers soccer moms will drool over.<eos> -I thought you hated politics.<eos> -I do.
Bugayev is telling me that they are willing to reduce their oil output by another 20% by the first of next month.<eos> What are the projections on gas prices?<eos> North of 150 a barrel for oil.<eos> Six, maybe $7 a gallon for fuel.<eos> My phone has been ringing off the hook, sir, from the U.K. to Poland.<eos> The IMF wants to help us with the debt relief solution.<eos> Sir?<eos> We need to respond to strength with strength.<eos> Well, I don't know how we could be any stronger, other than to invade Russia.<eos> And what if we do?
How do you make it stop?<eos> You don't.<eos> You use it, channel it.<eos> Is that what you're doing?<eos> I can help.<eos> Was hoping you would.<eos> Oh, you're doing this wrong.<eos> I mean, you're looking in the wrong place.<eos> So, uh... this Blake guy... he has safehouses, what, all over?<eos> All agents do.
- No, Mr. Hartz, it's okay.<eos> Thanks. Here, let me show you the Christmas trees, we're thinking about.<eos> - No Netflix?<eos> What am I gonna do all day?<eos> - Come on, let's tuck you in.<eos> Up we go.<eos> In we go.<eos> Dad, can you please tell Sophie to stay out of my room and stop eating myjelly beans?<eos> Soph, stay out of his room.<eos> But I didn't.
Yeah, their mom used to do this, but...<eos> Well, I do it now.<eos> Same boat, two sons.<eos> How is that the same boat?<eos> I guess just the number.<eos> Sorry, I don't usually eavesdrop on other people's carts.<eos> It's just...<eos> I'm Sandy, I have two sons.<eos> I already said that.<eos> Yes, you did.
Yes. And where were you 4 hours ago?<eos> "Trust in the Lord with all your heart "and lean not on your own understanding.<eos> "In all your ways, acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight."<eos> Father, I need you.<eos> I can't do this alone.<eos> I know that you're in control. Please, give me the courage.<eos> In Jesus' name, amen.<eos> Call to order.<eos> I assume Ms. Wesley understands that this board has the power to recommend any number of disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.<eos> She does.
Like God gave me the extra 5 minutes that I so desperately needed with him.<eos> I just don't understand why he never told me about his faith.<eos> Sharing one's faith with family, especially not knowing how they will react, can be difficult.<eos> Count our struggles as blessings, right?<eos> That is exactly right.<eos> There are more than 5 minutes awaiting you and your brother.<eos> John chapter 11, verse 25 to 26 says, "I am the resurrection and the life.<eos> "He who believes in me will live even if he dies. "And whoever lives and believes in me will never die."<eos> Do you believe this?<eos> I do.
Your Honor, I have one final witness to call.<eos> Grace Wesley.<eos> Ms. Wesley, please approach the witness stand.<eos> Do I have to?<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> Your Honor, given the witness's reluctance to testify, can I have the court's permission to treat her as a hostile witness?<eos> You may.<eos> Proceed at your own peril.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
We have, Your Honor.<eos> And how do you find?<eos> We, the jury, find in favor of Grace Wesley.<eos> We are adjourned.<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> Grace, I'm sorry.<eos> I couldn't tell you.<eos> It had to come as a surprise, otherwise the jury wouldn't have been swayed by your reactions.<eos> So, you did have a plan.<eos> No, you did.
This is so much fun, friend!<eos> Trust me, Di, I know you're frustrated.<eos> It's hard when you're as talented as you and I are.<eos> But it's not just about talent.<eos> It can be lonely at the top.<eos> All these private jets and five-star hotels and endangered-species dinners and... wait, endangered species?<eos> Are you raising money to help them or...<eos> I ate the last dodo.<eos> I want to eat the last something.<eos> Of course you do.

Thank you.<eos> Secondly, do you ever wonder if we're living too large?<eos> [Dramatic chord plays] We're broke.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> We just heard mom say we're living too large.<eos> I knew this was too much house.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I'm two years away from college, so this is more of a "you" problem than a "we" problem.<eos> Well, I've got a "disaster preparedness" folder.<eos> Of course you do.
Because your zombie plan was a mess.<eos> You thought after the apocalypse you'd still have Internet.<eos> Or your eyeballs.<eos> What you kids doing?<eos> I'm gonna start day-trading.<eos> Day-trading?<eos> That ain't nothing but gambling.<eos> Proud of you, boy.<eos> Just make sure you know what you're doing.<eos> He doesn't.
What was the only regret that escaped his lips at the end of his pathetic life?<eos> That the people of Mongolia allowed the fat fuck of a thief Kublai to steal the election with impunity.<eos> Something you'd like to say to me, bastard?<eos> My father was rightfully elected.<eos> Your mouth was barely dry of your whore mother's tit during the last Kurultai.<eos> Good shot, Arban.<eos> We'll be home behind a wall soon.<eos> Then he will be in someone else's safekeeping.<eos> You said you didn't choose this place.<eos> - I didn't.
Can't you fix the suit?<eos> It's not the suit.<eos> Raymond, you... you mustn't be discouraged.<eos> We're scientists.<eos> We learn from failure, and we keep going.<eos> Kendra isn't a lab experiment.<eos> She's a person.<eos> I know.<eos> You need to have confidence this will work.<eos> Well, I don't.
Is he all right?<eos> He sounded... afraid.<eos> Gideon, your father was a true believer.<eos> He'll be sorely missed.<eos> Nathaniel and I will do everything we can to continue our father's work.<eos> I'd expect nothing less from the Malick boys.<eos> Gideon, they're saying it's time.<eos> I already told them no, Nate.<eos> We have to go see him.<eos> - Like hell we do.
Right, 'cause if you were buying something, then I would have had to -- right.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> How about this, then?<eos> You guys go and pretend to buy something, you know, for the cameras.<eos> And then, um, when I get the register open, you guys pull out the gun, and then I give you the money.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> We're lying. We're not. No one has a gun.<eos> We might have a gun.<eos> Nobody does.
They'll find a test and see that I'm innocent.<eos> How did you get out of your cell?<eos> I'm the one who programmed the security features.<eos> Lincoln, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't hold us.<eos> But we want them to, right?<eos> Daisy... what did you do?<eos> I've got Malick.<eos> I have to get back to the base.<eos> They have something we need.<eos> Do it.
Don't play prince charming now, please.<eos> We're grown-ups, Gabriel.<eos> You had your chance to be with me and you left me.<eos> You left me because you're unable to risk anything.<eos> You're an indifferent apathetic stupid who was brainwashed by his mom.<eos> -What?<eos> -Your mommy!<eos> That old bag hated me for not being one of her polo club friends' daughter!<eos> -My mom didn't think that.<eos> -Yes, she did!
-Helping you do what?<eos> -To become famous, like Paris Hilton.<eos> Are you sick or what?<eos> Get dressed, Nicolás!<eos> We all know you're a dinosaur, and no matter how hard you try, you won't understand our stuff, so why don't you leave?<eos> Listen, Nicolás.<eos> It is you who don't understand.<eos> You haven't noticed that not even your mom loves you?<eos> -My mom loves me.<eos> -No, she doesn't!
15:35 on April the 3rd.<eos> Interviewing the suspect Kevin Grey are D.I. Clayton and D.S. Chohan.<eos> Noting that the suspect has agreed to be interviewed without having a lawyer present.<eos> Can we hurry this up?<eos> Have you got somewhere to be?<eos> Who told you that Freddie Lau had killed Kayleigh?<eos> Or why else would you have murdered him?<eos> You thought Freddie had taken the life of the woman you loved.<eos> I know Freddie didn't do it.<eos> I did.
What does that mean?<eos> That there's someone out there who has a vested interest in all of this.<eos> They are running it. Oh stop it!<eos> What about you, hey?<eos> Why are you involved in this?<eos> Cause... this person killed my mother.<eos> And I want to see him stopped.<eos> It's why I gave you the bracelet.<eos> But you don't know me!<eos> I do!
I wasn't in my right mind!<eos> Surely, you can see that!<eos> A Ming-era antiquity stolen from Miss Haleton's work in your lock-up.<eos> None of which you can explain.<eos> I didn't kill her, Suri.<eos> It's not enough for you to say it, Mr Clayton.<eos> You've given us nothing to make us believe you!<eos> You have to believe me!<eos> [SIGH]<eos> No, I don't, Mr Clayton.
We've both been invited to spend the day with Nikhail.<eos> He's got a pool.<eos> It'll be fun.<eos> Great.<eos> Good night, sweetheart.<eos> Mr Linton, this is Detective Superintendent Winter.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Did you show Dr Marghai the photos I sent over<eos> - for identification?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Sir, do you know this other man, this Mr. Hafeez?<eos> With regret, I do.<eos> He made friend of my son in Pune, Deccan College.<eos> His name is Imran Hafeez.<eos> So they did not travel to Oxford together?<eos> They did not.<eos> And this low opinion you suffer of Mr. Hafeez?<eos> He is a bad boy, no respect.<eos> Common, you understand.<eos> Oh, I do.
Soot, Mathilda, soot!<eos> London, where is it you go?<eos> To our home, Father.<eos> It is not our home, not any lo... good God, did you take Valerie Freeman with you to Whitechapel?<eos> She was curious.<eos> And why should she not be?<eos> It is a fascinating place.<eos> And do you not think, Mathilda, on what might happen to her, to you?<eos> You of all... you know what happens in Whitechapel!<eos> I do.
You assembled the<eos> - forensical evidence for your inspector.<eos> - I did.<eos> But why, Reid?<eos> Why the care?<eos> You miss this all so much?<eos> - The care was asked of me.<eos> - Who by?<eos> - Well, it doesn't matter.<eos> - Oh, it doesn't, does it?
We need to do this properly through Covert Ops.<eos> I don't feel comfortable winging it like this.<eos> Now, you know how long that's gonna take and they won't let us do it anyway.<eos> Marghai just needs to believe that you want to sell your kidney.<eos> Once I'm in there, I'm in their hands!<eos> This might be our only shot at them!<eos> Why the hell would you hurry while I've been tracking all this down by myself?<eos> I'm withholding evidence that would sink you and you're still sneaking off doing God knows what!<eos> You don't have to do this!<eos> Damn right, I don't!
So we're gonna come up with a solve, right?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We're working on it.<eos> Ruth, what's the status on that computer?<eos> She's right behind you, Mr. Harrison.<eos> Does she handle Analytic Geometry?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And she speaks.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I do.
I know you probably believe that.<eos> Good night, Katherine.<eos> Good night.<eos> Mama!<eos> Hey, babies.<eos> Mama.<eos> Hi.<eos> HEY-<eos> Oh, please don't tell me I missed someone's birthday.<eos> No, you didn't.
I guess I thought I could hit the reset button and start all over.<eos> Well, boys are not iPhones.<eos> I wish they were.<eos> - Hey, Em. Welcome back.<eos> - Hey, Zoe.<eos> Hey, Sigmund and Sigmunda Freuds!<eos> Anyway, did everyone enjoy the reading assignment?<eos> - Noah's got a little crush. - Really?<eos> You liked it?<eos> I didn't.
It's nothing, take it, it's--<eos> Nah, this is not to help me.<eos> This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, miss, bullshit you pulled.<eos> -Okay, Joe, let's go.<eos> -The bullshit I pulled?<eos> I work three jobs.<eos> This is the good one.<eos> O'Neill? I heard he had kidney stones.<eos> But no health insurance. So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.<eos> It didn't.
Hey, baby.<eos> It's six in the morning.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Couldn't sleep.<eos> Remembered we had some extra paint out back, and... it matches close enough, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Will, I know you're in there.<eos> Open up.<eos> This better be good, like I won the lottery good.<eos> You did.
You should just ignore Boris.<eos> Why do you react like this?<eos> Even you don't believe me.<eos> That's just perfect.<eos> Why is this happening just when we're finally on vacation?<eos> Gee, I don't know.<eos> Maybe I arranged it all myself, because I hate vacation. Right, Thijs?<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I'm sorry. I believe you.<eos> You do?
What?<eos> Hand me the blanket, Miss.<eos> Why?<eos> You're not supposed to have it.<eos> Hand me the blanket, Miss.<eos> No.<eos> - Miss.<eos> - I'll die.<eos> You won't.<eos> No one does.
You must get better, Miss.<eos> They don't get easier, the treatments.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> They get worse.<eos> How?<eos> Just get better, eh?<eos> If I'm not truly ill, then how can I get better?<eos> If you're not ill, then what are you?<eos> You wouldn't believe me.<eos> Dr. Banning doesn't.

Look at me, Vanessa.<eos> I'm not going to lie to you.<eos> There's a lot we don't understand.<eos> It's a mental and physical break, a disassociation with your bodily functions, something like a coma.<eos> When will it end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do people die like this?<eos> Yes. But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.

Finely done, cousin, I must say.<eos> Come on.<eos> The pitfight.<eos> Oh. Nobody thought you had it in you.<eos> Me neither.<eos> You know, uh...<eos> They always told me the world down there was no good.<eos> They'd gone and they'd lost everything that made life worth living.<eos> But me and you, we know that ain't all true.<eos> Oh, we do?
I have to prove myself...<eos> As a husband and a father.<eos> I mean, well, this isn't the sort of thing I'd agree to do normally, without an important reason.<eos> Of course.<eos> Did I ever tell you I started out as a lab assistant?<eos> Of course, I did, right?<eos> A good job, a real good job, but my heart wasn't in it.<eos> So, I quit to be a comedian, to make people laugh because when they laugh, they feel good.<eos> The thing is...<eos> They didn't.
Or "night work" as Miss Ives once put it.<eos> The night I met you, in fact.<eos> In the opium house.<eos> I remember.<eos> Given the chance to go back, would you do it differently?<eos> Walk the other way?<eos> Never meet me, or her?<eos> You've seen what I come from, that dragon that raised me, that land that reared me.<eos> I've known very little grace in my life.<eos> But I did with her.
If doing the deal without me is what you have to do, - that's what you gotta do. - Tariq...<eos> I am so sorry that I fucked up.<eos> This guy doesn't want to help you, he wants to use you. - Tariq.<eos> Tariq. - Ethan...<eos> Dude, I wanna be your manager, but more than that, i wanna be your best friend.<eos> Tariq!<eos> I didn't take the deal.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop. This care bear is your fucking manager?<eos> - Rainbow brite, here?<eos> - You didn't?
I saw you get shot point-blank.<eos> It's high-density Kevlar, now... who the hell are you?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm the Green Arrow.<eos> Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> Oliver Queen is dead.<eos> How did Oliver die?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No one does.
Where's Mr. Rory?<eos> Sleeping it off.<eos> We have the Neuromorphic Prototype.<eos> Any luck with the ship's engines?<eos> Yeah, it's all good.<eos> Is there something wrong, Ms. Lance?<eos> Well, all my friends and family are dead, except for Oliver Queen, who happens to be dead inside and missing his left arm.<eos> Sara, I have told you...<eos> That this is just a potential future and that it's all gonna go back when we return to 2016... if we return.<eos> But what if we don't?
We can keep you here for the rest of your life.<eos> You have to wake up.<eos> What if I can't?<eos> Then you won't be able to help your friends and they'll die without you.<eos> How am I supposed to help them like this?<eos> You learned to fight, didn't you?<eos> Only a little.<eos> You learned more than you think you did, and faster than an ordinary person could.<eos> But that doesn't matter now.<eos> It does.
Maybe it's too much.<eos> Or maybe it's the pain.<eos> He's going to die, isn't he?<eos> His heartbeat's getting slower.<eos> What do we do?<eos> You can't heal him, can you?<eos> No, but I can take his pain.<eos> It could help.<eos> It might even get him to start healing.<eos> - Then do it.
For what?<eos> Never could play the piano.<eos> I confess to be the one told Foster two jars gone light.<eos> Never thought he'd go pure crazy on you like that.<eos> You just wait till his ma passes on, you wanna see pure crazy.<eos> - Let me see it.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> I can scent the suppuration from here, Hasil.<eos> You need medicine.<eos> We all do.
I, uh...<eos> We were just trying to help Ezra.<eos> You and his ex-girlfriend Aria?<eos> But it's not what it looks like.<eos> There's gonna be a lock on that box tomorrow.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> We won't...<eos> And I actually thought you cared about what I had to say.<eos> I did.<eos> I do...
That doesn't even matter, but if I know you can bet that your opponent's camp knows as well.<eos> What do they know?<eos> The doctors gave me a clean bill of health.<eos> They supported my bid for office.<eos> How about letting me support you?<eos> Look, I was planning on telling you and Melissa after the election.<eos> But Gil, he, he begged me not to share this.<eos> It would, it would scare off the voters, hijack the platform.<eos> It would be all that anyone would ever ask me about.<eos> So what if they did?
They're inspiring.<eos> So here they are together again making a new commitment to be there for the best week ever and the worst week ever which sometimes happens in the same week.<eos> Byron, Ella do you promise to love, comfort and honor each other for the rest of your lives?<eos> We do.<eos> Then I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> Dad, you may kiss mom.<eos> But remember, you're doing it in front of your daughter.<eos> It can't be Mona.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Gifts, expensive lingerie, cake?<eos> Like, made for you.<eos> Not when we have two monsters after us.<eos> Spencer's not answering.<eos> Yeah, well, she's probably still dealing with the fallout from the Yvonne leak.<eos> There's no way Spencer's parents will believe Caleb did that.<eos> Yeah, well, be glad that they do because if they thought that we had a new A, they would march straight down to the police station.<eos> You guys, our stalker already warned us.<eos> Okay? If we talk to the cops we're gonna have targets on our backs.<eos> We already do!
You have friends coming in from New York...<eos> And I have friends who have already left.<eos> Ali can't come.<eos> She had to go out of town.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Okay, well, maybe now you can invite Mona instead.<eos> Honey, it's the first time in years that you and your friends have all been in the same place.<eos> Yeah, because of a murder investigation<eos> You need this.<eos> All of you do.
Felicity? Mm-hmm? I'm here to prep you for surgery.<eos> I'm going to be fine.<eos> Aren't you tired of this?<eos> Same dead end conversation.<eos> I'm not talking, I'm not helping.<eos> So how about you stop wasting both our time?<eos> The Green Arrow told me to have a conversation with you about Darhk. Wow.<eos> I'm surprised, John.<eos> I didn't think you had it in you.<eos> I didn't.
Who would want to set him up?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Detective, we may have found the murder weapon.<eos> Okay.<eos> Test it for prints and DNA.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Lucifer's prints are gonna be on that gun.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
I need to find Malcolm, and I need to send him back to Hell.<eos> Will you help me, brother?<eos> One last bit of punishment on the way out.<eos> It sounds like fun to me.<eos> Ah, there's nothing like a fresh shirt after a rainy rooftop.<eos> What is that smell?<eos> Tropical musk candles.<eos> Gosh, the sacrifices you made pretending to be a therapist.<eos> Yeah, I like that scent.<eos> - Of course you do.
We're looking for Malcolm, Detective.<eos> Now, we've been told that he's seeing an associate named Tommy?<eos> There are a lot of Tommys in...<eos> A beer.<eos> Of course.<eos> We'd very much like to know what you just realized.<eos> Too bad.<eos> I'm not telling you.<eos> But you want to, though, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
What can I say?<eos> It's hard to keep a good man down.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - And now<eos> I'm ready to get the old band back together.<eos> You have some product you can move?<eos> We've got some seizures just sitting there in evidence.<eos> Could actually get you a supply today if you've got cash.<eos> I always have cash, Malcolm.<eos> You know that.<eos> That I do, Tommy.

Where you kids off to?<eos> Just having some schwarma.<eos> Then back to campus.<eos> You're at the vet school?<eos> I came down there once with my pig, he had the flu.<eos> Flu's bad for pigs.<eos> But he's better now.<eos> -You have a pig in your truck?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> We all do.
In private.<eos> Off the record.<eos> Lay everything on the table.<eos> Sounds remarkably like a date.<eos> But what does your boss think?<eos> My boss isn't always willing to take the necessary steps to get things done.<eos> You're going rogue?<eos> How fun.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> You don't.
Winn, think about everything you've done for me.<eos> The last few months, becoming Supergirl, I wouldn't have been able to survive without you.<eos> You'd be fine.<eos> I mean, yeah, the Supergirl suit sucked.<eos> But you, Kara, with everything that you have?<eos> Everything that you... That you are?<eos> No, you don't really need me.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> - No.<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> I once went to sleep for a long time, too.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> But when I woke up,<eos> I wasn't alone.<eos> You're not gonna be alone either.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Kara.<eos> She didn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> No, she did not.
Keep your eyes open.<eos> Ms. Grant, everything okay?<eos> No, I need you in the office...<eos> Now.<eos> Hank.<eos> J'onn.<eos> I should have known...<eos> This isn't your fault.<eos> If I hadn't pushed you to use your powers, none of this would have happened.<eos> But it did.
- Like what?<eos> - Scared.<eos> - Of not getting enough retweets?<eos> - No...<eos> No, of losing you again.<eos> Hey, she did just fine for 25 years.<eos> Or, she was really good at pretending.<eos> I know you think your mom is this heartless, narcissistic monster...<eos> - Your words...<eos> - Some days, I do too.
If I'm all that's left, let it have me.<eos> No, this murderer does not get to win.<eos> And you don't get to give up.<eos> It will save Alex.<eos> We don't choose.<eos> We fight.<eos> Kara, I'm tired of being the last.<eos> Tired of having lived.<eos> You, of all people, know how heavy it is to survive.<eos> I do.
Oh, thank you.<eos> See ya.<eos> Michigan, Lansing.<eos> Minnesota, Jackson.<eos> Missouri, Jefferson City.<eos> Mississippi.<eos> You forgot Mississippi.<eos> Mississippi.<eos> God damn.<eos> I always do that.
No, she said private plane, VIP suite.<eos> I'm a premium player.<eos> A premium player's a guy who drops 50 grand a night.<eos> You didn't have time to be a premium player.<eos> Too busy getting tied to a bed and robbed by transvestites.<eos> They were real women.<eos> Even worse.<eos> Whoa, whoa, slow down.<eos> I lost 90,000? Huh?<eos> I did that?
The battery is dead.<eos> You guys ready?<eos> An entire file drawer of phony registrations, fake plates, VIN numbers... the whole magilla.<eos> Galasso's number two.<eos> Fucking feds are gonna shit.<eos> - Where the hell were you?<eos> - Fuck's it to you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I made a huge mistake.<eos> - We all did.
How did you get over it?<eos> It was hard going, but we just pulled ourselves up.<eos> - And then what? - When we got to the top, I don't know what happened.<eos> He was looking out over the edge and he must've slipped.<eos> I tried to grab him, but I was too late.<eos> The sound when he hit the ground was...<eos> And why didn't you contact the police sooner?<eos> - I was scared.<eos> - We'd think that you pushed him?<eos> - I didn't!
Give Gary the strength to trust in you in the dark as well as the light.<eos> And let him remember that Jesus was a prisoner too, and he will be with him always.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> I keep dreaming that I'm falling.<eos> And then... yank.<eos> It is going to be all right.<eos> You just have to tell the truth.<eos> They won't believe me.<eos> Nobody does.
Mmm-mmm, it looks like you had a big plate of pasta. Oh, my God, I'm a fatty!<eos> But it's for a good cause.<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> It's only boys.<eos> Once you get the blood rushing to their dicks, they're like your servants.<eos> All I gotta do is convince the one guy who always watches me to go inside and party with the others.<eos> Then there's ten minutes before I drive the day shift up.<eos> Ten minutes for Alonso to grab that shit from the wheel well.<eos> Shit.<eos> -What? Do it!
I can't.<eos> Sorry, Mum.<eos> But we were part of something.<eos> We saved them.<eos> I can't "move on" from that.<eos> And why would I want to?<eos> Mia will come back.<eos> She's got a point, Mum.<eos> It's pretty hard trying to be normal when we know what we know.<eos> Stuff no-one else in the world does...
We did all we could.<eos> Put Toon on.<eos> - Wim, where's the SD archive?<eos> - It's being processed.<eos> I want access to it, now.<eos> - Reason?<eos> - I don't have to give you...<eos> Jan is looking for the real name of an informant, alias Bella Tuerlings.<eos> And why didn't Jan submit an official request?<eos> I did.
Master, forgive me!<eos> I won't steal the Boots of Iron again.<eos> There is no room for a scoundrel like you here.<eos> Leave.<eos> Master!<eos> I really want to learn Kung Fu of the Iron Kick.<eos> You don't deserve it.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't deserve it?<eos> And Wu does?
You know how people talk about quitting their jobs, moving to Vermont and making cheese?<eos> You're the guy who actually did it.<eos> Except with yams.<eos> In California.<eos> Aren't you sumpin' sumpin'.<eos> The first year, I made $53.<eos> I had to send half of that to my ex-wife.<eos> You were married?<eos> I told you that.<eos> No, you didn't.
The yam pipeline.<eos> Is that all you want?<eos> I...<eos> Well, you know--<eos> Whatever you're afraid of happening, it's already happened.<eos> I think you like me as much as I like you.<eos> I do like you.<eos> But?<eos> I didn't say "but."<eos> Yeah, you did.
Your patients.<eos> You can't use your thumbs to spin the wheel, dumbasses.<eos> - They always use their thumbs. - Oh.<eos> Well, we look at people who've been shattered and different as less than.<eos> What if they're more than us?<eos> What?<eos> Do you believe them?<eos> Your patients.<eos> Just between you and me.<eos> - Yes, I do. - Hmm.
Wow, you're taking everything, huh?<eos> Well, I'm gonna be back in a month, to see my dad.<eos> And my mom said you can visit whenever you want.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, school's not gonna be the same without you.<eos> Nothing is.<eos> Jude.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I want to stay.<eos> Really, I do.
See if you could do something here for me. Lemme get this shit nigga... and get the fuck outta here man.<eos> Go on.<eos> Oh..get that nigga man.<eos> - You look good, bro.<eos> - Yo, I'm just out here you know.<eos> Business good?<eos> Yeah that's Good. No no no Hold on to that.<eos> ...I did a register on the weekend...<eos> - How your mama feeling now?<eos> - She doing good, she doing excellent.
Oh I miss her like.. Hell no.<eos> Some will say 'bout that.<eos> What's a Faggot?<eos> A faggot is... a word you use to make gay people feel bad.<eos> - Am I a Faggot? - No.<eos> Nah..<eos> You could be gay, but you got everybody call you a faggot.<eos> What I mean is...<eos> - How do I know?<eos> - You just do.
Hey black, I mean Chirone.<eos> What's up man? It's...<eos> It's Kevin.<eos> - You there?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Long time no see Right?<eos> and I asked Teresa for your number and...<eos> Hold on man!<eos> You... you do remember me, Right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Keep your voice down.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - It's my fault, um...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna go, okay?<eos> Um, I'll be back Friday.<eos> - This can't be my life.<eos> Jules, it can't be.<eos> - I wanted to see the fireworks.<eos> I really did.
Previously on The Fosters...<eos> You slept with him?<eos> Girl, what is wrong with you?<eos> I think you're in a position to become the spokesperson the foster community has been waiting for.<eos> So, you're flunking out, huh?<eos> Yeah, I can't go back unless I want to keep taking steroids,<eos> - and I don't.
I mean, it's not like there's some insurmountable obstacle keeping you apart.<eos> I just wish there was something else I could think about, you know?<eos> Hey, what about our senior project?<eos> - Maybe we could do something together?<eos> - You know what I need?<eos> I need to meet someone new.<eos> I need a hottie to drop out of the sky and turn my head around.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
Hey, girl.<eos> Um... I just-- I'm calling to see if you're up yet.<eos> And, uh, there's just one little thing that I want to talk to you about.<eos> Don't worry, it's not about the dishwasher.<eos> Jefferson Starship, Sol!<eos> -What are you doing here?<eos> -I'm sorry. I was just... resting here.<eos> All night.<eos> You told him.<eos> I did. I did.
Well, then why are you acting like you do?<eos> Because he knew I could forgive almost anything but this, with her.<eos> Oh, get over yourself.<eos> Sol did a stupid emotional Sol thing.<eos> And married me 24 hours after he did the stupid thing he did!<eos> He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery.<eos> -So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did.
Oh, get over yourself.<eos> Sol did a stupid emotional Sol thing.<eos> And married me 24 hours after he did the stupid thing he did!<eos> He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery.<eos> -So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did.<eos> Why- - What does it matter now?<eos> It doesn't anymore.
Thank you very much for coming.<eos> As you can see, I'm fine.<eos> Oh, there you go.<eos> There's the Robert I know.<eos> Closed down, shut off, just like every time we fought when we were married.<eos> This isn't that.<eos> I'm right and he's wrong.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> You won the argument.<eos> You always do.
So what's going on with Sol?<eos> I don't want to mention his name around you.<eos> Let's give him a different name.<eos> Paddy.<eos> Paddy told Robert about us.<eos> Robert kicked him out and Paddy showed up at my place.<eos> So you're trying to get away from Paddy?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I don't want to feel sorry for him.<eos> But you do.
- I hate that.<eos> - Hate what?<eos> That I like him?<eos> In his own childish way i think he's a good guy.<eos> - No, no, not that.<eos> That, you've never seen me beyond this, big brother thing.<eos> - Cause Gordon, you're my best friend.<eos> You think best friends make the best lovers?<eos> - Where the fuck's Claire?<eos> - You fuck, you didn't just do that to me.
- I'm driving.<eos> I'm keeping the clock running.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You came to me for work.<eos> I mean, how'd you lose that job anyway?<eos> Creative differences.<eos> Really?<eos> And how's, uh, Ricky's check cashing con paying off for you?<eos> Because no one asked you to skip town to Pittsburgh for some Greaseball shithead.<eos> Yeah, well, he did.
You know, I'm thinking of getting out of it for a little while. Rejuvenate.<eos> -Out of what?<eos> -"It," man.<eos> The daily grind.<eos> -You don't think I'm in "the grind"? -No, I do.<eos> It's just that... no.<eos> No, I just want to get out of here for a minute. Get some sunshine.<eos> -Dude. -Come on.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, I do.
This is the one I started with.<eos> And you can see here, your aunt Mary calls down to report the murder.<eos> Freddie goes off to find the body.<eos> And if we keep moving, it's later...<eos> There.<eos> We arrive to inspect the body.<eos> There is no evidence of the killer making their escape, but, then again, they could've left by another route.<eos> Good morning, everybody!<eos> Ah, JP!<eos> - How you doing, Chief?
Er, but everything we've learnt about John Green tells us he was hard-working, honest...<eos> A good egg, no less.<eos> A bon oeuf, Florence.<eos> So, how come within hours of arriving on holiday, visiting an island he'd never been to before and travelling on his own, no less, someone got into this honest and well-liked man's room and brutally threw him to his death?<eos> Well, we had a lovely day, didn't we, Selwyn?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> And it's so nice to hear the old stories about you, Inspector.<eos> What stories would these be?<eos> Well, I had no idea you had a family nickname.<eos> I... I don't.

I don't.<eos> Oh, come on, Humphrey, you remember.<eos> I don't!
- How long was the affair?<eos> - A while, on and off.<eos> Then it just sort of fizzled out.<eos> Fizzled out?<eos> That must've been difficult seeing as you worked so closely together?<eos> I always knew it wouldn't last.<eos> Did Robert have the other half of that?<eos> - What?<eos> - The pendant?<eos> No, no... my mum does.
Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard would never walk off that bridge.<eos> Damn straight he wouldn't.<eos> But Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard ended up all by himself in a crappy apartment paying for hookers.<eos> Watch it.<eos> And getting visits from his son only when the neighbors complained about the noise and cigarette smoke.<eos> He knows who you are.<eos> Show him who you can be.<eos> I've seen that person.<eos> I think Duval should see him, too.<eos> You done?
Yes.<eos> You ever think about coaching sports?<eos> That was a humdinger of an underdog speech.<eos> There's only one way back into Duval's life.<eos> He asked me for help once.<eos> Only time he ever asked for my help with a case.<eos> And when he asked for your help, what did you do?<eos> Those are my granddad's old boxes, and my dad's case files are over here.<eos> Does my dad know you're here?<eos> No, he doesn't.
- There it is.<eos> Uh, the baby is doing just fine, Elena.<eos> - That's fantastic to hear.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Inner organs look as they should.<eos> No irregularities whatsoever.<eos> Absolutely nothing to worry about.<eos> - See.<eos> - You want to know the sex?<eos> - Yes, I do.
You forget how good hot water feels.<eos> All right, everybody. Let's get to work!<eos> - You want us... you want us in there?<eos> - Yep?<eos> Want us in there?<eos> 'Cause we'd be more than happy to... contribute.<eos> - Kermit! - Huh?<eos> - Oh! - Denise!<eos> Uh... oh, no. I missed your 5k run!<eos> - No, no, yes, you did!
Okay.<eos> Yesterday, you said that you were gonna draw boundaries<eos> - and spend more time with me.<eos> - I-I know.<eos> But instead, you blew me off and... and spent the night at work, curled up with your ex?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, but I-I am so sorry, you know?<eos> And... and all I can think of to say is...<eos> You sure look pretty after a 5k run.<eos> Do you know how long a 'k' is?<eos> Because I did not.
What?<eos> Uh, excuse me. Uh, everybody?<eos> I just got off the phone with the network, and they loved our new take on the show!<eos> Hey, what do you know about that?<eos> !<eos> Cheers, mon capitán!<eos> I think we'd all like to see more of you on the show.<eos> - Aw. - And the rest of you, too.<eos> If I knew your names, I'd praise you all individually.<eos> But since I don't, cheers!
Come on.<eos> The school rugby team embarked on a long, unbeaten road.<eos> And the local papers put it down to my friend.<eos> The new star right half.<eos> But the players worshiped Pascal.<eos> Stop!<eos> Number '9', congratulations!<eos> You have an announcement to make?<eos> - No.<eos> - You do.

No, I'm not, Wally.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cool. Um...<eos> I'll just leave them here.<eos> It's okay, Wally.<eos> Feel better.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Hey, hey, hold up a minute.<eos> I got somewhere to be.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Melanesian choirs.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> - Wait, you know what that is?<eos> - No.<eos> It's religious music from the Solomon Islands.<eos> Oh, so you're selling out.<eos> Why Melanesian choirs?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Oh, man.<eos> - Hey, Chip.<eos> - Hey.<eos> All right, man. Be good.<eos> - [Dennis] Another satisfied customer?<eos> I got you some Kombucha.<eos> - Oh, great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Man, I thought you liked this shit.<eos> - No, I do.
But a lot amnesty got thrown around. You know, democracy.<eos> Well, he looks like he's on Tania's team now.<eos> They have to earn their place in society rather than simply being handed this on a plate.<eos> They fear democracy...<eos> It's all right, I'm her uncle.<eos> - He's not my uncle.<eos> - It's a figure of speech.<eos> We've got an excellent product.<eos> We don't have to do that.<eos> Uh, yes, we do.
Where do you live?<eos> Just south of here.<eos> Gorgeous doorman building, very hip, full of beautiful people.<eos> Hey, you know what might help the vibe in this place?<eos> One of those chairs shaped like a giant hand.<eos> You know?<eos> And I think... yeah... it would just fit through.<eos> Ooh. Do we have a match on your dating app?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Some nigga to get you shoes you like.<eos> Some nigga to get you bags you like.<eos> All of that stuff.<eos> Yo, what the fuck is this?<eos> You carrying a piece in my shop?<eos> 'Keisha, it's our shop.<eos> And it ain't exactly on the Upper East Side.<eos> I was protecting us.<eos> You know how to use that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah, I got a 7-19 here at 811 Fairhope.<eos> Signs of possible forced entry.<eos> Suspect is at large on foot.<eos> No one else here, but a neighbour just showed up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> See you soon.<eos> Hey, did you see that?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Use that.<eos> - We've never met before.<eos> Remind her who the First Lady is.<eos> Good morning, Julia.<eos> Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> We want to be inclusive.<eos> We'd like the NRA to work with us on getting this bill passed.<eos> We have major support on both sides of the aisle.<eos> Well, you do for now, but not for long.
Sheriff, they want a picture with you.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> All right. - I'll be right back.<eos> - Okay, big shot.<eos> Norma Bates?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Rebecca Hamilton.<eos> I work for the bank.<eos> Oh, how do you know me?<eos> I don't.
Just someone I knew before I met you.<eos> Do you remember when I first met you on the porch at the motel that night?<eos> Yeah, my heart stopped, mostly because I thought you were gonna arrest me.<eos> No, I missed that opportunity.<eos> Well, I guess... I guess it all turned out okay in the end, huh?<eos> All things considered?<eos> You think so?<eos> You think it's all gonna be okay?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Of course, with a little bit of prompting, perhaps you'll have more success encouraging him to reveal his secrets.<eos> This is unseemly.<eos> I'm going back to the house.<eos> Darling!<eos> Ask your nigger who is he, besides a spy and a murderer?<eos> Why was he working for you?<eos> And ask him the names of all of his conspirators, everyone who intrigued with him?<eos> Do this, and I will spare his life.<eos> Of course... we already know you were involved.<eos> Do you?
Who is Kunta Kinte?<eos> No more than 20 of us colored boys make it out of Fort Pillow alive.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Ol' Nathan Forrest couldn't kill us fast enough.<eos> After I got shot, me and George, we took to the woods, then to the river.<eos> Yeah, you must be Tom.<eos> He said you had arms as big as cannonballs.<eos> Say you were smarter than Jeff Davis' own engineers.<eos> He said you were the hunger in his heart.<eos> He did.
I wanted to get back at Amy, and there are no mannequins in the store that look remotely like her.<eos> Which, can we talk about that for a second?<eos> Why are there no spanish/latina themed mannequins?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, we not talking about that.<eos> Let's talk about this.<eos> Jonah, what is happening?<eos> Do you own one of each of us?<eos> No!<eos> I went to a bunch of different stores over lunch, and then I just happened to pass this in the window of a sex shop, and look, it looks just like Amy. All: Whoa!<eos> - Yeah, it does. - Ew!
Get the fuck out!<eos> I have a copy of the NYPD's complete file on your brother's case.<eos> I- - I doubt you've had access to it.<eos> You'll have to turn the pages for me, won't you?<eos> -Ah. -Thanks to your ridiculous security requirements.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Unless, in the name of mercy, you could untie the bindings.<eos> I'd still be in your medieval straightjacket, but at least I'd have some degree of control over the movement of my arms.<eos> Hey, maybe you don't get it.<eos> Or maybe your bosses don't.
- Where?<eos> -In the school bathroom.<eos> But really, dorft worry. it's not serious.<eos> Hovv do you mean?<eos> We're not going out.<eos> That's all right, then?<eos> You're smoking?<eos> Since When?<eos> We never saw you smoke.<eos> I didn't, in front of you.
Or I'll call the police.<eos> Grégoire, come with me.<eos> Come with me!<eos> Hurry UP!<eos> I'm fed up.<eos> You're a crap father.<eos> You pretend to care about us but all you do is yell at us.<eos> Nonsense!<eos> I didn't yell at you.<eos> I never do.
All right, ladies.<eos> Time to call it a night.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yo, what's up, Hank?<eos> I need a beer.<eos> I think I can help you with that.<eos> But first, you up for hitting Omar's tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just need to go home and take a quick shower.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Today, too.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just can't do it.<eos> I can't do it to Elaine.<eos> Oh, Grace.<eos> You know... when I went back to Robert after you... I just shut down.<eos> After he left, I tried dating someone, but... he wasn't you.<eos> God, I wish things were different.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Who the hell is that?<eos> I'm trying to tell you that Kenny Loggins never bought your painting.<eos> I made the whole thing up.<eos> What?<eos> You were having such a hard time with your art.<eos> Your kiln had exploded.<eos> You thought you were going color-blind.<eos> I just wanted to give you a win.<eos> So Kenny Loggins never even saw my painting?<eos> No, he did!
If they died before him, then they were sick before him.<eos> I think the guy we saw was the female doctor's boyfriend, which means either he got her sick or she infected him.<eos> Either way, this ledger should prove that Sayid came in after Dr. Sanders was already sick, but the pages are missing.<eos> Someone tore them out.<eos> Katie, I just incinerated a little girl's body and collected the ashes of a fellow cop.<eos> OK?<eos> Can we save the detective act for the morning?<eos> Please?<eos> I'm sorry. Did you have a bad day?<eos> In an endless stream of them, yeah, I did.
Well, you like her.<eos> Now that's new.<eos> Yeah, that's what Jana said.<eos> You saw Jana?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's... she's fine.<eos> She's good.<eos> I gave her your keychain of hopes and dreams.<eos> Yeah, you did.
But now they're not doing theirs.<eos> Sir, I'll find a way to cover.<eos> We'll be lucky if we can cover our own asses now.<eos> Dr. Lommers just called from Washington.<eos> National Guard's on their way.<eos> Food drop failed, so they're bringing in the big guns before they try another one.<eos> But it failed because of her.<eos> I mean, she rushed the timeline.<eos> You really think that matters?<eos> You really do.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> We'll be there. Mm-hmm.<eos> My guy's at the data center now, but he's only gonna be there another 20 minutes.<eos> He got tickets to the damn baseball game, if you can believe it.<eos> And this guy just lets you in.<eos> No badge, no warrant, nothing.<eos> He's my guy.<eos> Do you really want to know what that entails?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
You think he'll help us?<eos> Well, when I knew him, he liked to go to battle against the big guns.<eos> And he is one now.<eos> So I guess we'll see.<eos> Is the medicine working?<eos> We won't know for a little while.<eos> Do you think it will?<eos> I want it to.<eos> Do you have a mom?<eos> I did.
Lex Carnahan, I never expected to see you under investigation.<eos> And yet you called me in.<eos> I don't remember getting your name.<eos> Blake.<eos> And, Lex, I'd like to look at this as a conversation between coworkers.<eos> We want the truth to emerge, and I would imagine you want that, too.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> And your cronies watching from that camera in the ceiling, they want the same thing, too?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, they do.
Scared of the virus.<eos> Scared of each other.<eos> I'm not the right person for this.<eos> Any of this.<eos> You're a good police officer, Jake.<eos> The fact that you're here, that you stayed behind... speaks volumes about your character.<eos> Kate always gave me a hard time when I thought about giving up.<eos> She always saw me as... more of hero than I saw myself.<eos> She had a way of seeing the good in people.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Kate always gave me a hard time when I thought about giving up.<eos> She always saw me as... more of hero than I saw myself.<eos> She had a way of seeing the good in people.<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Another one?<eos> There's no way we're gonna get through here.<eos> We're going this way.<eos> You have no idea what you're doing, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hey, um... there was an inscription in the book.<eos> It was handwritten -- about not killing.<eos> Is it yours?<eos> ‭It's not, no. 'Cause I also noticed you only put vegetables on your plate during dinner.<eos> And, I mean, you're teaching me aikido, and if aikido means not to kill, then that means that you're --<eos> It's not about what I think.<eos> People can --<eos> They can try and set you in the right direction, but they can't show you the way.<eos> You know, you got to find that for yourself, and... I thought I had it.<eos> I did.
Unless you're smart.<eos> Your choice.<eos> You could be like them or me.<eos> Or them.<eos> Make it easy on yourself.<eos> I ain't ever gonna kneel.<eos> Yeah, I said that, too.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> See that's the thing, man.<eos> You don't.
Right?<eos> A lot of suspense there.<eos> I don't think she even knew how much.<eos> All right, let's get this show on the road.<eos> See what kind of goodies you got in the cupboard.<eos> We put aside half the supplies.<eos> No, Rick.<eos> No.<eos> You don't decide what we take.<eos> I do.
We were trying to get away from them, and I got knocked off a bridge.<eos> I fought the current, wound up in the inlet.<eos> The estuary?<eos> The bay?<eos> Look, I'm not good with geography.<eos> I just thought I was dead out there.<eos> And I got to the shore, and I just passed out.<eos> It's the bridge on Windsor.<eos> You... you know how to get there?<eos> We do.

So, for once... do something useful... and make me a bullet.<eos> Don't beat yourself up.<eos> Why would I?<eos> He...<eos> He asked you about Mark and Amber, and you sold 'em out, right?<eos> You had to.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> Whatever helps you sleep at night.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> I don't.
And now I wonder... maybe we're not supposed to just sit around waiting for someone to love us enough to make us real.<eos> Maybe it's our job to love someone else for them to become real.<eos> We're not the rabbit.<eos> We're the boy! Wow. That must have been some ceremony.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't you even want to know if you got in? Uh... Nope, didn't get in.<eos> Come on, you're just saying that to make me feel better.<eos> Honestly, I didn't.

That's good to know, baby.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Mm. Wow, you smell fantastic.<eos> I'm in a situation.<eos> Svetlana.<eos> We had sex last night.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is it gonna happen again?<eos> It already did.
Rule 1...<eos> Do not rearrange the star stickers on the ceiling.<eos> They're set for the equinox.<eos> That's Rule 1?<eos> Rule 2... If I get stuck in my shirt, you will help me remove my shirt.<eos> A "G" and a nerd sharing a room.<eos> It's like "The Odd Couple" up in here.<eos> Rule 3... you may only use references I understand.<eos> - It doesn't say that.<eos> - It does.
Louis: Oh, wow. That feels amazing.<eos> Jessica: [Sighs] It does feel amazing.<eos> [Giggles] Oh, I like that.<eos> I can't believe we can deduct your sit-down hair dryer as a business expense.<eos> Deduct that bitch!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Emery!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> It's not what it looks like. This is your romantic date?<eos> Doing your taxes?
What do I see?<eos> I see Frank coming down the stairs, through the flames, carrying a baby.<eos> Now, he's almost out the door of the building when we hear somebody else screaming.<eos> Well, yeah. So I hand Lenny the kid and I head back upstairs.<eos> I head out the door, and all of a sudden, there's all these photographers outside, snapping photographs of this white cop cradling a black baby.<eos> The crowd is cheering,<eos> Lenny's taking bows...<eos> Two minutes later, Frank comes stumbling out, covered in soot, helping this old man in his underwear.<eos> Now, nobody wants to see a picture of an old man in his underwear with a cop holding him.<eos> Well, maybe now they do, but...
Where's Reagan?<eos> He stayed back at the house just in case she doubled back.<eos> Good.<eos> Really good work.<eos> Meet me at the squad; you fill out the DD5, okay?<eos> Eddie!<eos> Jamie, we got him!<eos> We got Jeffers!<eos> I don't care.<eos> Don't ever do that again.
Do you have two oxygen tanks?<eos> And two argons?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are they for the trip back home?<eos> Well, for the trip back...<eos> - Or if there is a problem.<eos> Not for today or tomorrow, but...<eos> Then we have one extra oxygen.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Show the way, Vesa.<eos> The surface manager will go ahead, I can give you a push.<eos> Don't.<eos> - Okay, no more then?<eos> "Don't touch me, God damn it!"<eos> I'm not phobic, but get your hands off my butt.<eos> I might as well carry these all the way up.<eos> Patte, did you notice?<eos> The cave collapsed.<eos> Yes, I did.
Hey. You made a deal?<eos> What kind of deal?<eos> It's a year's license suspension...<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Five years probation,<eos> - $14 million in resti...<eos> - No jail time?<eos> You think these women want to get dragged through a trial?<eos> I think those women want justice.<eos> I do!
Stop it!<eos> That's your dad calling to wish you a happy birthday.<eos> Yes!<eos> Don't forget to get the flight info for your trip.<eos> Alright.<eos> Hi dad!<eos> Hey, happy birthday, kiddo!<eos> Thanks!<eos> Did you get the birthday present I shipped?<eos> No, I didn't.
We got a mission.<eos> I don't care how long it takes, I'm not abandoning my post until the CO tells me to.<eos> What mission?<eos> What mission?<eos> Sleeping Beauty!<eos> Doc says she thinks she could be the key to the whole thing.<eos> How are we gonna protect her if we're dead?<eos> We need a plan.<eos> Well, it sounds like you already got one.<eos> I do.
Do what?<eos> Ask questions and lie.<eos> Especially about him.<eos> We know what he did to you, Violet.<eos> Gina told us everything.<eos> You found her?<eos> Did you find Daisy, too?<eos> Her real name is Sheila.<eos> Sheila Woods.<eos> And, yes, we did.
You have a whistle-blower at the NSA.<eos> Which is why I need you to handle this.<eos> Keep it off the agency's radar.<eos> Why me?<eos> I need someone I trust.<eos> I'm not the obvious choice, then.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> You don't talk to her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Why me?<eos> I need someone I trust.<eos> I'm not the obvious choice, then.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> You don't talk to her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> You?<eos> No...<eos> I don't.
How do you think your clients will feel about their intimate activities...<eos> been filmed on hidden cameras?<eos> That must take a bite out of your business.<eos> Makes me think someone made you an offer you couldn't refuse, like, maybe, a certain assassin.<eos> Maybe these theories amuse you, but I have pressing shit to attend to.<eos> Okay, I reconsider cutting this short, since we know you're a paid informant for the FBI.<eos> You told Agent Lange you have no connection to Heavy.<eos> But... she doesn't know that your boy, THX, helped him kill Retro Girl.<eos> - She doesn't know?<eos> - No, she does not.
You want a target?<eos> I'll give you a fucking target.<eos> Fuck.<eos> So, you know, once we're rolling, I'll ask any question I want.<eos> Hope you're ready.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> What I'm about to say, I'm not sure you're ready.<eos> Ready to go in five... four...<eos> Come on, Trip, I don't need this shit.<eos> Yes, you do.
But, in the end, that is how the cyanide got into Caroline's glass.<eos> It was added after the Commissioner picked it up.<eos> So, who DID poison Caroline's glass?<eos> Well, before we answer that, there is another question we need to consider.<eos> Just who was it who sent the anonymous letter to Caroline warning her that her life was in danger?<eos> It could only be someone 100% loyal to her.<eos> Someone like you, Ellery.<eos> It was you who sent the letter, wasn't it?<eos> - You knew somebody was trying to kill Caroline?<eos> - He did.
He came to our house when he took you.<eos> Wally's there now.<eos> No, no, Dad, this is good.<eos> We know where he is, and we know what he wants.<eos> That means we know how to beat him.<eos> How do you propose we do that?<eos> We use me as bait to lure him back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Cisco and Wells can kill him... again.<eos> Who are you pretending to be now?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> Yes, you do, Barry.

Are you gonna tranq me again?<eos> Don't tempt me.<eos> Look, I know you guys made a pact to keep Zoom on Earth-2, but you did that without me and Wally.<eos> All right?<eos> You don't get to do that!<eos> Barry, look at yourself right now; you're not okay.<eos> Cisco, my dad was just killed in front of me!<eos> Do you have any idea how that feels?<eos> Watching someone you love die?<eos> Yes, I do.
This is too low.<eos> See, there should be a bullet hole right around here somewhere.<eos> See, the bullet from Garrett's leg wound was never found, right?<eos> With all this lead in the walls,<eos> CSI just assumed that it was in there somewhere. But they ignored this shot in the ballistics report.<eos> Because it didn't match Hame's account of the ambush?<eos> And this bullet is a different caliber than the shooter's.<eos> .32 steel jacket. It's enough to ricochet off concrete.<eos> So you think whoever shot our Vic in the throat also hit him in the leg?<eos> Yes, I do.
And my Blockbuster original series has been keeping me very busy.<eos> I still don't get how that's gonna work, at all.<eos> Babe, it makes total sense.<eos> They make the whole season, put it on six DVD's.<eos> People go to their local Blockbuster Video and rent it out one disc at a time for five days each.<eos> What if someone already rented the episodes they want?<eos> They can just get something else, like The Illusionist or The Prestige.<eos> - Whichever one you were in.<eos> - Do you know which one?<eos> - Do you?
I'm happy for you, BoJack.<eos> - How about a kiss for good luck? - No, BoJack.<eos> I'm your agent and your friend, and I will always support you.<eos> But I'm 33 years old, and I want to have a family by the time I'm 40.<eos> I don't want to spend the next seven years in and out of love with you.<eos> I've wasted too much time waiting for things to happen.<eos> And I'm not gonna wait anymore.<eos> And for what it's worth, I always liked the horse from Horsin' Around.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah. Everybody did.
Does that mean they've already scoffed all his emotions?<eos> Well, according to the tracker, there are nine life forms.<eos> He's still alive, but barely.<eos> Living in an emotionless semi-state, his mind almost totally blank.<eos> No change there, then.<eos> But with each Polymorph we eliminate, sir, part of the Cat's personality will return.<eos> Hey, buds, I need a hand here.<eos> I'm busted up really bad.<eos> - How did you know that wasn't the Cat?<eos> - I didn't.
Hey, that guy you shot, genius, was the one with the key.<eos> You shot our captain.<eos> That true?<eos> - Hey, keep your goddamn hands...<eos> - Get back.<eos> Don't... don't... don't hurt him.<eos> I'm going to give you to the count of five to tell me where the key to the boat is.<eos> - One.<eos> - He doesn't have it.<eos> Who does?
I can't tell you what you want to hear.<eos> I'm no better than the man that cut the rope.<eos> I cut the rope.<eos> What you did to that boy,<eos> I did the same.<eos> To my son's mother.<eos> So I know what it costs.<eos> It cost a part of me.<eos> How do I get that part back?<eos> You don't.
Go on, do your thing.<eos> Mama, it's me.<eos> I'm worried about papa.<eos> He's lost his way without you.<eos> I don't know if you could see him.<eos> Maybe you could see him.<eos> He's just so frail.<eos> Can't even stay angry at him anymore.<eos> If you were here, Iknowyou'dknow exactlywhatto do .<eos> ButI don't. Idon'tknowwhattodo .
Let's talk, buddy. You know, the school really wants us to keep talking to our kids about trolling on the Internet and how serious it is. I guess the troll from the school message boards is now harassing a famous Olympic athlete from Denmark.<eos> Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?<eos> Yeah, well, she kind of called him out and said he could never get her to quit social media, and you know, you might say she's asking for it. But, uh, now this troll is being copied by other trolls who are all dog-piling to see if they can get her to quit, and, well, God only knows what they're gonna do tonight.<eos> Well, good night, pal. You be sure to let your mom know we talked more about the horrific consequences of trolling.<eos> I want to tell you that I'm sorry. For what?<eos> When women first started getting trolled on the school message boards, I was sure it was you. I was wrong.<eos> I really tried to become a better person. To show that I was trying to listen. So, when you held the assembly that women were just as funny as men, you... you weren't being sarcastic?<eos> Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina,<eos> Do you miss your friends? I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did.<eos> You do now. Cool.
So that's what I did, Mom.<eos> I just brought him back.<eos> And now we get to stay.<eos> You know, I'd do the same for you.<eos> What?<eos> I can bring Travis back.<eos> - No.<eos> - Mom, listen, nothing can touch me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Papa!<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> I know what he meant to you.<eos> What is it that you want?<eos> Nick.<eos> - He's just--<eos> - I'm not the boy's daddy.<eos> I just thought that-<eos> - I don't know what's happening to him.<eos> Yes, you do.
I trust the American people to make the right decision.<eos> What if you think they're gonna make a certain decision and they make a different decision and then it completely derails what you thought was gonna happen?<eos> - And then your plans are different.<eos> - Oh, honey, don't cry.<eos> Mommy's gonna get elected, honey.<eos> Marjorie and I broke up.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> - Do you need a tissue?<eos> - No, I'm fine.<eos> Yeah, no, you do.
Yeah, but Jack, if they have exclusive rights to the algorithm, then we can't use the algorithm to build the platform.<eos> For five years.<eos> They wanted seven, I talked them down.<eos> I know, but you said that we could build the platform once we gave you the box.<eos> Yes, but I never specified a timeframe.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I save your ass and you stab me in the back like this?<eos> - In the front, Richard.<eos> - Laurie, did you know about this?<eos> - I did not.
Yeah, try to keep up, Dinesh.<eos> We get our money in stages.<eos> Right?<eos> We get $2 million upfront to get us going, to design and build the product, but we don't get the next three million until we take a product to market.<eos> And Jack was okay with hemorrhaging money, because he thought we were launching the box and then getting the next three million in the next few weeks.<eos> But the platform will take way longer to launch than that.<eos> Yes.<eos> So we are effectively a $250 million company who just took $5 million in funding and now we're dead-ass broke.<eos> Our burn rate is astronomical, and every day we sit in limbo like this...<eos> What if we don't?
I thought I'd ask for 15 percent stake, you'd counter with five, we'd settle on ten.<eos> - Well, then, it's settled.<eos> - I'll draw up the paperwork. Speaking of paper, Piper Perabo and Pauley Perrette need to push back the pitch on the Princess and the Pauper project.<eos> - You have a night off tonight.<eos> - A night off?<eos> - When's the last time that happened? - It hasn't.<eos> - Can I help you with anything else?<eos> - Get me a date for tonight. Make that three dates.<eos> Who knows when I'll get another night off?<eos> I do.
Do you have family somewhere else?<eos> My family was here when it started.<eos> Some left.<eos> Border was closed.<eos> We were trapped.<eos> What do you want?<eos> We want your help.<eos> We need it.<eos> - We have nothing to offer.<eos> - You do.
A mob attacked him, herded him with the other infected.<eos> They were killing them.<eos> So I rushed in, I tried to save him.<eos> There were limbs, jaws, blood.<eos> It was chaos.<eos> And in this moment as I was beaten by the living, I was bitten by the dead.<eos> A hand found me and I saw Luciana.<eos> She brought me back here.<eos> We waited for death to come.<eos> - But it didn't?
What room is the honeymoon suite?<eos> Tower 1711.<eos> Hey, I'll be back for the toast.<eos> She in there?<eos> We met at UCSD.<eos> Took me a year to work up the courage to talk to her.<eos> Just to speak.<eos> I couldn't breathe.<eos> I know that feeling.<eos> No, you don't.
Okay, you know, I gotta say I don't feel like I'm in charge.<eos> If you're gonna throw a tantrum, forget the whole thing.<eos> I'm not throwing a tantrum-<eos> - Why are we having sex in my car?<eos> -Can we at least go back to your place?<eos> -No, BoJack.<eos> I don't know where you live.<eos> You control every part of my life, I don't know anything about you.<eos> [scoffs] -You don't want to know me, BoJack.<eos> -No, I do.
The map of profitable agencies, that is.<eos> Perfect, because without it we could be in--<eos> Real trouble.<eos> We did not hit our projected earnings for the year.<eos> The year's not over yet.<eos> We still have one day to go all out.<eos> Rutabaga, do you think we have the spunk and moxie--<eos> That's a good name for a lady detective series.<eos> --required to pull this off and save the agency?<eos> Hell yeah, I do.
Maybe.<eos> I don't know, Dad.<eos> They were bored.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Look, I-- I just want to say, Dad, that I get it.<eos> Oh, you get it?<eos> What is it that you get?<eos> What you're trying to teach me.<eos> I mean, you don't even like James.<eos> No, I don't, son.
Where's Alicia?<eos> Is he okay?<eos> He'll be okay.<eos> Can you come with me?<eos> Mom?<eos> There's something I didn't say last night.<eos> Something I need you to understand.<eos> You don't need to say anything.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
Yesterday, you were afraid of people leaving.<eos> Today, you're afraid of that bite.<eos> I was shaken.<eos> - There's a difference.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> You're petrified.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Tell her.<eos> You want to do this?<eos> No, I don't.
That was a test and you passed.<eos> Wunderbar.<eos> Now, let's get you out there.<eos> Yes, gotta get out there, on to the stage, to announce the nominations.<eos> Just as soon as I-- Oh, my God, is that Bradley Cooper?<eos> Bradley Cooper?<eos> We love him for some reason.<eos> -Where?<eos> -Let's go, Todd.<eos> -Oh, God, what do we do?
Yes, but I...<eos> I don't feel that way.<eos> I have hope.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, I'm fine.<eos> I wasn't actually shot.<eos> My injuries were powder burns.<eos> No nightmares?<eos> No flashbacks?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Like a broken clock.<eos> Okay, so she's an imperfect victim.<eos> Call your friend Calhoun.<eos> My friend.<eos> I never thought I'd say this, but thank God for texting.<eos> [chuckles] I'm tempted to send that girl's family my legal bill.<eos> So I assume this will be the last we hear of the matter, counselor?<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> Rita, we have a problem.<eos> No, we don't.
No, it's not.<eos> Chris is going to testify and tell everyone lies about me.<eos> Mr. Barba won't let him get away with that.<eos> We were in the darkroom kissing.<eos> I kept asking if everything I was doing was okay, and she didn't say no, so I kept going.<eos> How far did you go?<eos> I put my fingers inside her.<eos> I couldn't have done anything else even if we both wanted to, because I finished early.<eos> Did you have sex with Abby Stewart?<eos> No, I did not.
How's your father?<eos> Dad passed away, two years now.<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> My condolences.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I was passing by and thought I'd come over to ask you to solve this apartment situation.<eos> It's hurting so many people.<eos> Dad made the deal 6 years ago, he died and so far, nothing.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Yes, you do.
On this beautiful day<eos> We are going to celebrate<eos> May the house you live in...<eos> Ladjane.<eos> - You remembered!<eos> - Today's your birthday!<eos> - Happy birthday!<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You know you can always count on me?<eos> - Yes, I do.
This probably won't go anywhere, but give her a call.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Look, just another week and things'll be back to normal.<eos> No problem.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Ms. Clara!<eos> I don't know if you remember us, ma'am.<eos> I do.
It'll be quicker and less unpleasant.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> I know many people like you.<eos> I know your tricks.<eos> OK.<eos> I have only one question.<eos> Paul Lefebvre isn't his real name.<eos> I figured as much.<eos> Did he ever tell you his real name?<eos> No, he never did.
Seeing as you're eating for three and Jell-O won't cut it.<eos> Uh, where's Stefan?<eos> He had to step out for a bit.<eos> Step out where?<eos> Step out where, Valerie?<eos> He went to Mystic Falls.<eos> Damon's gotten himself into some trouble with Julian.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, I-I told him he didn't have to worry, that I would stay here and look after you.<eos> Yeah, of course you did.
Emphasis on the "insane."<eos> I thought you'd be back in Mystic Falls by now.<eos> I just, uh... wanted to say thank you.<eos> For today.<eos> We still make a good team, don't you think?<eos> Well, Rayna's dead.<eos> Julian's safe.<eos> You'll surely sleep easy tonight. ♪ Should I go somewhere else ♪ ♪ And hide my face?<eos> Bonnie?<eos> And what if I did?
But that is the way I feel about you, however, Tilda... a princess to me. Then you must stop.<eos> There is something I have learned, and learned to my cost, Samuel Drummond.<eos> It is that life is not a fairy tale, and that those who seek to make it one too often do so for the real and felt unhappiness of their actual lives. Do you understand? I am not unhappy, Mathilda.<eos> I could make you so, however.<eos> I could make so and fast.<eos> There are no princesses and no monsters, only humans... their flesh and bones and all too broken hearts.<eos> I am fond of you because you are real.<eos> And I can not find anything hidden or broken about you.<eos> You must be fond of me because I, too, am real. Do you see?<eos> I do.
_<eos> _<eos> Ma!<eos> I'm sorry, I'm too exhausted to keep secrets.<eos> - She won't say anything. - Mm-mm.<eos> Ay... _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Trust me, I know how difficult this is.<eos> You don't.
Ed. That's his name?<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Because he told me between punching me in the face and me calling him a pig.<eos> I don't think you should stay here tonight.<eos> I think you should go stay with some friends or family, or something like that.<eos> I kind of take care of myself.<eos> I did, until Billy came along.<eos> Maybe we should just run.<eos> You don't think he can track you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Like, away from everything else?<eos> To go into nature and just take a photo of myself, alone?<eos> Good idea.<eos> Go be alone. Ooh!<eos> Went there.<eos> I really don't like this woman-on... look at me.<eos> I really don't like this woman-on-woman aggression.<eos> Like, instead of cutting each other down, we should be building each other up.<eos> Like Kayla... you, for instance, have a real air of gravitas.<eos> I do not.
Oh, hey.<eos> Just one second.<eos> What's up?<eos> Um, do you want to go get a sandwich?<eos> The tornado warning's been lifted, and Jimmy's making meatloaf.<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Chili, I'm trying to talk to you.<eos> About what?<eos> That woman almost died today.<eos> Yeah, but she didn't.
As soon as the agreement is signed, I'll call.<eos> Sir, it is a good deal.<eos> In all fairness, sir, I-I don't think anyone could have anticipated a U.S. ambassador leading a demonstration against his own country.<eos> With that said,<eos> I'm gonna do everything I can to...<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> The president hung up on me.<eos> I'm sure he doesn't blame you.<eos> No, no, he does.
What are you doing here?<eos> Tulip?<eos> Tulip?<eos> You're his Tulip?<eos> Of course.<eos> I should have known that.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> What you doing? Putting stuff away.<eos> Emily asked me to help out, so, uh...<eos> Emily did? Mm-hmm.
Oh. God.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, um... I will get out of your hair.<eos> When I saw him this morning before church, he said he was gonna come by to find you.<eos> Before church...<eos> Nope. No, I-I didn't see him.<eos> It's the darndest thing.<eos> Actually, you did see him.<eos> I did?
Or will you let me burn, too?<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Where'd Cassidy go?<eos> Jesse?<eos> Where's Cassidy?<eos> Jesse?<eos> You know about him?<eos> What he is?<eos> - That's right.<eos> You did.
Jesus.<eos> Where is God?<eos> I am the Resurrection!<eos> I am the way and the truth!<eos> Where is God?<eos> ! I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> None of us do.
You want to tell me what's going on?<eos> Nothing's going on.<eos> - You got into a fight. - Yeah.<eos> Well, what am I supposed to do when someone calls me a freak?<eos> Not fight.<eos> Come on, we don't fight.<eos> We're above that.<eos> Yeah. Try being here.<eos> - Okay. I know.<eos> - No, you don't.
- You're coming after me?<eos> Yeah, I'm coming straight for you, actually.<eos> - Oh, well then. - Yeah.<eos> Come and get me.<eos> So, are we... are we good?<eos> You know what might make us good is you jumping in this lake.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You want me to jump in the lake?<eos> - Yeah, I kind of do. - Okay.
Not that old.<eos> Not old-old.<eos> But old enough that it uses broadcast technology instead of digital.<eos> We can transmit a signal by calibrating it to Myriad's frequency, without leaving any online fingerprints.<eos> Take that, Indigo.<eos> It'll ride the wave without anybody knowing a thing.<eos> - I have one question for you, Max.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> The earrings, how did you know I would wear them?<eos> I didn't.
Okay?<eos> Tell me something.<eos> What did you do before you retired?<eos> I was in a Patsy Cline tribute band.<eos> No.<eos> I'm deadly serious.<eos> You ever miss life on the road?<eos> Nah. Nah, I had my fun.<eos> You want to know the secret to living a long and happy life?<eos> Actually, yes, I do.
Jim-Bob.<eos> From Texas.<eos> Howdy!<eos> So, why did you go and see this so-called witch in the first place?<eos> What are you even doing here, Agatha?<eos> Research.<eos> Roy asked me to do an article on... castles.<eos> In a wig? Castles?<eos> I thought you said you had a family crisis.<eos> I do. I-I did.
I want to go on my own, Agatha.<eos> Um, do some thinking.<eos> OK.<eos> Well, if you want me to join you at any time, just text.<eos> Let's just give it some time.<eos> Morning, Agatha.<eos> Morning.<eos> What time is James' flight?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Not bad per se.<eos> A compliment. Not grudging.<eos> You were right when you said that I don't really even understand--<eos> -Naman, don't you have a girlfriend?<eos> -Yes.<eos> No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Either way, you're unfaithful.<eos> No doubt you have some twisted Brahman justification to explain it away.<eos> He does.
Shit, we can't pass here. Follow me.<eos> Ready?<eos> Come on.<eos> Stay low.<eos> How the hell did they find us again?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> They lost us when we went in that cave, right?<eos> And they found you two when you went outside with the rubies.<eos> We never even had a chance, then.<eos> We don't.
Ugh.<eos> You know, we could never serve this where I work.<eos> It's over roasted and totally acidic.<eos> Jodi, it's an AA meeting.<eos> The only thing this coffee needs to be is not vodka.<eos> You do know you two aren't fooling anyone, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mom, everyone knows you and Steve are dating.<eos> - No, they don't.

- Yeah, 'kay, bye.<eos> Will you stop?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Cameron, the way you've been acting, like charging right into things and you're so impulsive,<eos> I don't know if you're overcompensating, or trying to impress me...<eos> No, it is not about you.<eos> It's just how I want to live my life now, that's it.<eos> Just unafraid.<eos> Kirsten, you know how I feel about you.<eos> You do.
This whole town is to pack up and move on?<eos> There's the family house.<eos> If I borrow money against that, we can pay the men.<eos> It might give Jericho a chance at least.<eos> Well, then do it.<eos> It's what my father would have expected.<eos> It seems you can't fight who you really are.<eos> When you told me you were a Blackwood, I knew this day would come.<eos> This doesn't have to change things.<eos> With the best will in the world, Johnny, it does.
Uh... Yes.<eos> On account of the curls?<eos> And precociousness.<eos> - And stardom.<eos> - You flatterer.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Generally, we're better at queens than kings.<eos> In this country I have a feeling you'll be no exception.<eos> - I certainly intend to do it well.<eos> - I did, too.
For stability.<eos> There's more.<eos> - Clarence House...<eos> - Our home. What about it?<eos> We have to give it up.<eos> The home of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom is Buckingham Palace.<eos> Says who?<eos> Me.<eos> I thought you hated that place.<eos> I do.

Already sealed.<eos> You ok?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I... I was just thinking it's been two days with no one trying to kill us.<eos> It won't last.<eos> I know.<eos> But are we just supposed to spend the time between attacks dreading the next one?<eos> Not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
♪ Travel to the car ♪<eos> ♪ And find a juror ♪<eos> ♪ Your heart is true, but you're not walking fast enough. ♪<eos> You and Nick, tell me everything.<eos> The power went out.<eos> We went into the basement.<eos> There were rats, he passed out, we kissed.<eos> (squealing softly): Oh, my God.<eos> And you like him.<eos> No. No, I don't.
That's not just tea.<eos> No.<eos> Some situations require more than just tea.<eos> Like when you shoot your first person?<eos> You didn't have a choice.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> At least you didn't kill her.<eos> She's lucky you aren't a better shot.<eos> How did she know about the Stitchers program?<eos> She didn't.
It would help you get closer to finding your father.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Okay. Why don't you tell me?<eos> Well, your brain scan came back clean.<eos> There's no trace of Kim's mind manipulation left.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you for what you did at the studio.<eos> How did you know that I'd snap out of it and not shoot you?<eos> I didn't.
- Drinks.<eos> - Big ones.<eos> All right, so, ah, I was thinking martinis.<eos> Uh, I also have some tequila. What do you think? Wow.<eos> Oh, I know you likey.<eos> I know all your fantasies, Joshua.<eos> And I'm gonna make them come true!<eos> Ow, God.<eos> Why do you like this?<eos> I don't!
No, she did.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Laura, what's all that flour and stuff for?<eos> For my cupcakes, remember?<eos> Saturday's my turn at the baking booth in the farmer's market.<eos> I remembered this morning but now my god, it's the day after tomorrow.<eos> I have so many cupcakes to make.<eos> Oh my.<eos> You don't like your pie?<eos> No, I do.
It's time.<eos> Thanksgiving has always meant sharing the bounty of our rich land, especially turkey. But the one thing we will not be sharing this holiday is Drumstick or Cranberry.<eos> Catherine actually personally chose those names, didn't you, honey?<eos> - Um, yes, I did.
Previously on "12 Monkeys"...<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Sam! What happened to me?<eos> The Witness took control of you.<eos> I don't love you!<eos> You did once.
This the sacrifice you were talking about?<eos> Hmm. - You knew this was gonna happen?<eos> - Ticky-tock, those eyes.<eos> Left, right, swaying like a granddaddy clock.<eos> Can't take 'em off me.<eos> God damn it, Jennifer.<eos> Today is September 23, 2044.<eos> The day I die.<eos> This didn't have to happen.<eos> It already did.
How far did you get?<eos> - How far did you...<eos> - It's not there!<eos> I used the tracker and the coordinates.<eos> Nothing is there.<eos> I scouted the entire area.<eos> You're wrong, Ramse.<eos> Titan doesn't exist.<eos> Zeit says that Titan doesn't exist.<eos> - It does.
Luffy naturally didn't know any of that.<eos> Now we don't have to follow your crappy rules anymore.<eos> And we can fight back!<eos> While making up our own rules!<eos> We're pirates, you know!<eos> We use force to take what we want!<eos> So we'll be taking our friend back now!<eos> TESORO!<eos> Luffy!<eos> You did it, Luffy!
Just don't mention the party.<eos> I can't!<eos> That's not the story I constructed.<eos> I am so bad at this.<eos> You're getting a fleece blanket for father's day!<eos> Sue, don't worry about it.<eos> It'll be an even bigger surprise when she sees you're there.<eos> Just leave it that you're not coming home.<eos> So I should tell her I'm not coming home?<eos> You already did that.
That's not accurate.<eos> I drink just the right amount.<eos> I don't mean to judge.<eos> It's all right.<eos> No sweat.<eos> I'm am esthetician by trade.<eos> - No shit. - Mm-hmm.<eos> And you got a nice face.<eos> - Please.<eos> - You do.
We need to lock down for launch.<eos> So lock down, then.<eos> We can't until your Scorpion tech team leaves the premises.<eos> They haven't left yet?<eos> Okay... I got everything on the list.<eos> Great.<eos> Now fill up the water and gelatin mix in the drum with the proportions that I gave you.<eos> The kaolin clay from the glass polishing kits acts quickly as a bonding agent.<eos> Now, Happy, where do you keep that D-12 refrigerant hidden?<eos> Um, I don't.
She was my patient.<eos> My patient... not Perello's, not yours, mine.<eos> And I screwed up, and now she doesn't get to go home and tuck her kids in!<eos> They don't get to see their mother again!<eos> You should have seen the look on her husband's face!<eos> It's called a silent heart attack, and it comes with very little warning.<eos> I know what a silent heart attack is!<eos> I know!<eos> But that doesn't mean anything to her family<eos> And that doesn't do anything for me!
That's where the best man is.<eos> The only man.<eos> They're better equipped to deal with gall bladder problems in America. Due to the high fat diets they have here.<eos> Leaving me without you for the summit with Ike.<eos> - Can't you delay it?<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> Besides, you have already stated your ability to run the ship without me for some time.<eos> In jest, my dear boy, when you become mutinous and presumptuous.<eos> You know how much I depend on you.<eos> - I do.
A mile and a half.<eos> What will we do if he plays up before the race?<eos> He always plays up. That's who he is.<eos> You don't seem the slightest bit worried.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Well, can I just say one more time, for the record... I think we should start fast, and run at a good clip.<eos> - Noted.<eos> - I am right sometimes, you know.<eos> Even you said yourself that I have good instincts.<eos> You do.
- Yes, I could tell.<eos> You were smitten, blushing like a little girl.<eos> - Well, he is rather a wow.<eos> - A "wow"?<eos> Tall and handsome, saturnine.<eos> A bit of a Heathcliff.<eos> He wants total control.<eos> Well, any artist worth anything would insist on that.<eos> - You don't really want a flatterer.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I know only because I tried to get one for Mike and was refused.<eos> Yes.<eos> On account of him not being a family member.<eos> - Porchey is like family.<eos> - Is he?<eos> Yes.<eos> Part of the furniture.<eos> Well, as long as you don't sit on him anytime soon.<eos> - Well, that all seemed to go well.<eos> - Yes, it did, didn't it?
It's what you want, what you've always wanted.<eos> For me, it's the parties.<eos> I-I've always been a loner, so I don't mind going home, making some dinner, doing some work.<eos> But standing at a party with a drink in my hand while everyone tries to introduce me-- it's the worst, am I right?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I'm sorry. What did you say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Um, you asked me if I was seeing anybody.<eos> Y-Yes, but you don't have to answer me.<eos> Y-You really don't.
France is in Europe.<eos> Know what I made outta this here silk?<eos> A dress?<eos> Why would I waste it on that?<eos> I made this fine table covering.<eos> For fancy company.<eos> Well, with what you got left, you should make yourself a dress,<eos> I bet you'd look real pretty in it.<eos> You got a wife Mr. Clay?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'll elope with him, there's no other way.<eos> No, Kaveri.<eos> Kaveri, think about dad...<eos> he's already suffered a heart attack.<eos> If you run away... he'll be humiliated.<eos> Dad will be heart-broken, Kaveri.<eos> And what about my heart.<eos> - Does anyone care if that shatters?<eos> - Of course we do.<eos> I do.
Stop it.<eos> ♪ dirty work ♪ I don't know why he's so cocky.<eos> Everything above his lip and below his nose if fake.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I've been in this business a long time.<eos> I can spot a fake body part a mile away.<eos> - Like his mustache?<eos> - And your nose.<eos> - I had a deviated septum.<eos> - We all did, sweetheart.
For the first time, what Michelle was going through finally made sense.<eos> Good news, we know what it is.<eos> Bad news, there's no cure.<eos> So we manage.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'd like to do a full workup before discharging her.<eos> See if we can find what caused those spasms.<eos> Could take a couple of hours.<eos> You guys okay with that?<eos> Do what you do.
Okay. But did you?<eos> At the funeral, when you put a flower on her casket...<eos> The car... it has an old tube radio.<eos> - Local oscillator.<eos> - The oscillator.<eos> Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> Okay, if you could rewire it, you might be able to turn the PLL receiver into this... into a low power mono FM transmitter that produces a signal that you can trace.<eos> I know.<eos> You do?
- I'm ready.<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Okay.<eos> [laughs] Hey, guys.<eos> I talked to my abuela, a ghost expert.<eos> She ain't afraid of no ghost.<eos> And she said that our ghost is clearly a local haunting.<eos> A local haunting... that makes sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't.

That's a good question.<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's a... good question.<eos> While it's true this workshop is geared toward couples, many of the principles covered here-- such as communication, trust and teamwork-- apply to all relationships.<eos> Including working partnerships.<eos> So given that Steve and Danny traveled all this way, I've agreed to sign off on their therapy hours once they've completed the course.<eos> I should also tell you that I've spoken with Steve and Danny about their partnership, and it is fraught with some very serious problems.<eos> So I think it would be both cruel and irresponsible for us to abandon them in this time of crisis.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't.
I'm doing it.<eos> If you don't come with me, I'm going with that fat guy over there in billet six.<eos> The one with the hair on his back.<eos> Two margaritas?<eos> Beer tonight.<eos> She's... resting.<eos> Sure.<eos> Looks like something tropical's blowing in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Dr. Yedlin.<eos> That was... very impressive, what you did in there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I mean... segmental recession of saphenous vein interposition graft?<eos> That's right.<eos> I was... just wondering, sir, if it might be possible for you to teach me that.<eos> I don't work here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You...<eos> You don't?
- You know, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression.<eos> - The wrong impression?<eos> - Natalie just had a baby.<eos> - Oh. Uh-huh. I know that.<eos> - Her husband died only six months ago.<eos> - I know that too.<eos> - So, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression.<eos> - It amazes me how dumb a doctor can be.<eos> Everybody knows you like Natalie.<eos> - They do?
He could barely talk about you.<eos> She's the one. Who went to see him every sunday.<eos> She took him to church.<eos> She took him to the doctor's.<eos> She changed his oxygen.<eos> She changed his fuckin' diapers.<eos> You know that we had to pay for a live-in nurse at the end?<eos> We're in something of a hole. Here at the moment.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It doesn't?
Yeah.<eos> Lucky for you. You have a paper record. Of the man you used to be.<eos> Whereas for most of us that younger person only exists. In our memory.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> I was beginning to think. There wasn't anyone interesting to talk to in all of new jersey.<eos> But... You're a famous author.<eos> And you've been to prison.<eos> Sir thomas malory wrote le morte d'arthur. When he was prison.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
And if you don't do The Walk, I will tell Sarah everything... about Miranda, about Alison.<eos> I'll tell her you don't believe.<eos> Dr. Gottlieb is wonderful.<eos> A brilliant dentist and the kindest man you'll ever meet.<eos> And this is where you would sit.<eos> - Looks like home.<eos> - Doesn't it?<eos> So do you have any experience in the dental field?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I don't.
Leave me alone!<eos> Oh, shut up!<eos> Perhaps it's time to let him go.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> You must.<eos> He's all I have.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You've got me.<eos> I do?
I'm hungry and in pain.<eos> Where does it hurt the most?<eos> Blood pressure is 130 over 110.<eos> Pulse is 85.<eos> Suspected fracture on his left ankle and right shoulder.<eos> His vitals are good.<eos> Give him glucose and painkillers through an IV drip.<eos> Wait.<eos> Do you know how?<eos> I do.
Hmm. Yeah.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He got the message.<eos> Damn right he did.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Where you go...<eos> People walking away from me!<eos> You know the FBI?<eos> Jody does.
I wasn't always this girl.<eos> Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror, and I'm like, "that's me?"<eos> Yeah, you said you had to run away from home?<eos> Jody took you in?<eos> You should know... I've done some really bad things.<eos> Let me out!<eos> Hurt people.<eos> You got any idea what I'm about to do to you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
You have no idea how hard it is to get it.<eos> Well get some help because this is gonna be huge.<eos> I can't!<eos> I've already used half the jar that you gave me last night.<eos> I need more.<eos> No.<eos> 50/50.<eos> Malcolm, listen to me.<eos> - I don't need this.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Yeah, looking forward to it.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> - Malcolm Caulfield?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Detective Burkhardt. This is Detective Griffin.<eos> What'd I do?<eos> 'Cause I don't remember doing anything bad.<eos> You shoot these photos?<eos> Ah, Summer Blake.<eos> Yeah, I did.
What the hell?<eos> How'd you get in here?<eos> I told her I had permission.<eos> Don't be mad at her.<eos> You look like shit.<eos> What's goin' on?<eos> I went to a party, um, in Vegas.<eos> Private jet.<eos> I just got back.<eos> I did too much... too much shit.
You know how grumpy former employees tend to be Chatty Cathys.<eos> - And you came up with this.<eos> - I did.<eos> That's pretty impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, Brittany, get an IT guy to blow these images up, and then all three of you go through this list, and find somebody that knows what this shit is.<eos> You don't think the video would be enough?<eos> With this judge?<eos> No, I don't.
It's all right.<eos> There's nothing nefarious in feeding.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> As soon as she's done... you're handing her back.<eos> There, there, my little sweet pea.<eos> There, there.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Your mummy knows exactly what you need, doesn't she?<eos> Yes, she does.
Let me speak to Donald.<eos> He's not in.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> He's always in.<eos> Put him on, Nicole.<eos> He's not in.<eos> Therefore, I must by law allow this lawsuit to proceed.<eos> Mr. McBride has filed for a number of discovery requests and moved for an expedited discovery schedule.<eos> Well, obviously, we'll need a few months to comply with those requests.<eos> No, you don't.
He's invasive.<eos> Shouldn't be stalking you like that.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> He's not a stalker.<eos> He's a schmuck.<eos> He was just looking for Denise or something.<eos> Thank God she was on a school trip.<eos> The look on his face was priceless.<eos> You really enjoyed that, didn't you?<eos> Yeah. I did.
Have fun.<eos> I'll just go back out there and listen to your daughter Gerald tell me all about her problems.<eos> All right, you know what, it's time for you to calm down, because I'm starting to see the vein.<eos> Good!<eos> The vein comes out for a reason.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're the reason.<eos> Yeah, well, when the vein comes out, the hand comes out, remember?<eos> Remember the last time your hand came out?<eos> I did this.
What's the weight?<eos> About two grams.<eos> Felony weight.<eos> Hopefully, whoever owns it'll do the right thing, and your daughter can get the charges dropped.<eos> She's inside.<eos> We couldn't very well just stick her in a cell.<eos> Mom.<eos> Who owns the drugs?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Divide and conquer?<eos> It worked for Julius Caesar.<eos> Want something to eat?<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> Look, you don't have to babysit me anymore.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You know, your mom's just upset, because she's scared about what's gonna happen.<eos> She's not the only one.<eos> She doesn't think that you own the drugs, Nicky, but she thinks you know which one of the kids does.<eos> Do you?
Well, it looked empty from the top of the hill.<eos> There's a note.<eos> "Off to invade Hortensia.<eos> Back in a jiffy."<eos> Looks like we definitely have the place to ourselves, huh, guys?<eos> - What's going on with them?<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> What's that?<eos> You want to hear how we spent our evening?<eos> - No, he really doesn't.

Well said.<eos> Let's saddle up.<eos> It's time for battle.<eos> I am ready for war.<eos> And not just to sit in a comfy chair and watch up on a hill while eating cucumber sandwiches, although that was delightful.<eos> No, I am actually ready to stand next to you and fight.<eos> Sounds like you found your manhood, Richard.<eos> Bobby found it...<eos> A bunch of times, if you know what I'm saying, huh?<eos> Unfortunately, I do. Ow.
That's... That's my brother.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> So, uh, you...<eos> You two have patched things up.<eos> Everything's hunky-dory.<eos> It must be if you're having slumber parties.<eos> His buddy dropped him off here.<eos> Evan tied one on, and he's crashing here, so that he doesn't have to face Mom until he's sobered up.<eos> And you know he's allergic to pet dander, so...<eos> - Oh, I didn't, actually.
Here's a cat and some chocolate.<eos> Enjoy the trip.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thank you. ♪ Hyah!<eos> Keep it! ♪ Roberta, wait!<eos> Put down that cat.<eos> Wha...<eos> Richard, you're... You're alive?<eos> You didn't go to war?<eos> No, I did.
- Come live your li...<eos> - No, stop talking and kiss me.<eos> ♪ Aww! Aww!<eos> - Ew! - Ew! I love you so much.<eos> Enough already!<eos> Show-off.<eos> Yeah, this could get ugly. We should go.<eos> ♪ Do you, your highness, take this male model ♪<eos> - ♪ To be your wedded sp... ♪<eos> - I do.
- Ew! - Ew! I love you so much.<eos> Enough already!<eos> Show-off.<eos> Yeah, this could get ugly. We should go.<eos> ♪ Do you, your highness, take this male model ♪<eos> - ♪ To be your wedded sp... ♪<eos> - I do.<eos> ♪ Do you, good sir, take your social superior ♪<eos> - ♪ To be your wedded sp... ♪<eos> - Yes. I do.
We just stay here and put up with this shit<eos> - for the money.<eos> - Right.<eos> Just like Leonard Letts stays at Borns Tech.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> No one ever died because Donald fucked them.<eos> And don't kid yourself.<eos> Lucy knows exactly what she's doing.<eos> You know who I really hate, though, right?<eos> - You do.
Uh, "Jason, don't forget to dig up our time capsule this summer."<eos> You know anything about that, Jason?<eos> Uh, when I was in sixth grade, uh, back when I was a kid, I, uh, had to do a school project, and, uh, I had to bury a family time capsule.<eos> But I'm not supposed to dig it up till I'm 21.<eos> There's a beer in it.<eos> We had a lot of stuff in there...<eos> Um, newspapers... pictures of the family, coins, stamps, some predictions.<eos> Father Anan came over last night.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
All right.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm weird, too.<eos> Did you know cicadas spend 17 years underground, and then emerge and immediately shed their shell?<eos> They spend all that time building it, and then just leave it behind.<eos> Do you know... that if you cut a worm in half, both sides stay alive?<eos> Jack.<eos> Let me talk to your Uncle Garrett for a minute, okay?<eos> You said you'd never come back.<eos> I did.
And I want you to know that I mean it, you know?<eos> This isn't me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.<eos> What trip to Las Vegas?<eos> The one everyone's taking this weekend on the party bus.<eos> Of course, I wasn't invited.<eos> That would be my understanding.<eos> On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?<eos> Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behavior.<eos> I hope that you can accept my apology.<eos> Of course I do.
All Dr. Hong wants to do is talk about my feelings.<eos> - It's so stupid.<eos> - I know, baby.<eos> But you only have two more sessions to finish, and you can go back to school.<eos> Don't you want to see your father at Career Day?<eos> No.<eos> And you hate him too, so why do you even care?<eos> Riq, come here.<eos> I do not hate your father.<eos> Yes, you do.
I care more about your need to tell me.<eos> But truthfully, I'm not curious.<eos> Isn't that part of your job?<eos> - You know what?<eos> - What?<eos> Those who see blue rats are always right.<eos> I've given 30 years to the company.<eos> And I've been unfailingly loyal.<eos> I really believed in it.<eos> And I still do.
Yes.<eos> Can it... be nice?<eos> Well, that's on you.<eos> Let me know by 9:00.<eos> - What if we die before then?<eos> - There's not much I can do about that.<eos> Okay, you know what, you know what, we'll discuss this amongst ourselves.<eos> I mean, uh, nobody wants to see how the sausage is made,<eos> - am I right?<eos> - No, they don't.
- like murderer-style, stabbed Paul?<eos> - No.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> I loved him.<eos> Love?<eos> Right.<eos> He's my current husband.<eos> I love him now.<eos> I do.
- Oh, that's... horrible.<eos> It's horrible.<eos> - Well, I preferred that to what I knew would happen, and did, that everybody would find out what I was doing.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - I would picture you finding out.<eos> Like I would close my eyes and I'd picture your face and I'd see all this hate in your eyes that I knew I could never come back from, and I kept on fucking her, and you hated me anyway.<eos> - What?<eos> - You hated me.<eos> - Horace, you thought I hated you before we broke up?<eos> I didn't hate you.<eos> I didn't.
That's what true love is.<eos> It's sacrifice.<eos> It's giving up everything for the person you love.<eos> But Hades won't give up a single thing for you.<eos> Like he said, he wants it all.<eos> Listen to her.<eos> She doesn't think you deserve to be happy.<eos> Look at this office.<eos> Look at this town. This all belonged to her when you had nothing, remember?<eos> Of course I do!
Zelena!<eos> I owe you thanks for your help.<eos> I have embarked on many a wrongheaded quest in my time.<eos> I'm just glad to finish one that was righteous.<eos> I only wish I knew what happened to Emma.<eos> Emma did exactly what she needed to.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just...<eos> I do.
Are you happy?<eos> I gave them the wrong dimensions, and they screwed it up.<eos> I'm a screw-up!<eos> I admit it!<eos> Just please, don't let this be the only thing you remember to say at my funeral!<eos> So...<eos> Yes?<eos> Did I tell you what happened at the funeral after you left?<eos> Why, no, you didn't.<eos> Because something did.
Character-loving girls.<eos> That sounds obscure.<eos> Very made-up.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> So you're talking about loser girls.<eos> Like, they get drunk and they do something stupid.<eos> We've done that story a bunch of times.<eos> Different takes on it.<eos> I thought you knew our site.<eos> Oh, I do.
Okay.<eos> Now I got to go comfort Eli.<eos> - Thank you. - What for?<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> You stuck by me through the presidential.<eos> I made a mistake there with you, and I'm sorry for that.<eos> All rise.<eos> The Honorable Judge Richard Cuesta presiding.<eos> So I understand we have a plea deal.<eos> We do, Your Honor.
I suppose I do.<eos> It's okay.<eos> What if we couldn't get in this way?<eos> You've already done the hard part.<eos> No.<eos> The next part is the hard part.<eos> After that, they'll never recover.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Your feelings matter.<eos> No, they don't.
- Go to the arcade.<eos> - Cool.<eos> I'm sorry, what is going on, and who are you?<eos> I'm his wife. Who are you?<eos> - You're married?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Dudes, you want to step in here?<eos> - No.<eos> - Not really.<eos> I don't.
- Look at you!<eos> - There's no height requirement.<eos> What?<eos> I still can't believe they gave you a gun.<eos> Hey, man, I'm a graduate of Quantico.<eos> Agent Brody Nelson.<eos> Sound good, don't it?<eos> It does, it does.<eos> I know.<eos> Yes, it does.
And entirely my son's fault.<eos> I have been too indulgent with him.<eos> Dad, they were just protecting me. Enough!<eos> I hereby banish the Guardians of the Galaxy from this palace.<eos> Fine.<eos> We wouldn't stay another night in this dump if you begged us.<eos> Come on, Quill.<eos> Ah, here's the thing.<eos> Um, I didn't get banished.<eos> You guys did.
Please.<eos> You must understand, I was young.<eos> I heard legends of an artifact, a force for good so powerful it would bring peace to the universe, create a golden age for all life.<eos> That artifact was the Cosmic Seed.<eos> My father refused to let a prince of Spartax chase after a myth.<eos> But, of course, I went anyway.<eos> And I found it too.<eos> You found the Cosmic Seed?<eos> But you told them you didn't have it.<eos> And I don't. Not anymore.
I'm COO of St. Matthew's, and you can direct your questions to me.<eos> I have no comment at this time.<eos> Come with me, please.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think it's great that you've made this gesture of donating your work, and thank you, but you shouldn't be talking to the press on our behalf. Apologies.<eos> They shoved a mic in my face.<eos> You know, if you were a work of art... and I'm not saying you aren't... you would be a study in...<eos> Oh, please, don't try to define me, okay?<eos> - You have no idea.<eos> - No, but I do.
Throw your gun down.<eos> Sir, please.<eos> Amar. - Ma'am.<eos> Get their guns.<eos> They killed my friend.<eos> Her body is lying somewhere at the back.<eos> Rafiq, go check.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Do you know everything?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Really, Mother.<eos> What else is there?<eos> Oh, I've, uh, already looked up a couple of part-time jobs that'll allow me to pay for my own insurance.<eos> - That's not necessary.<eos> - It is to me.<eos> I'm an adult. I don't need to be on my step-daddy's insurance.<eos> You know, actually, I think that's great.<eos> I think it's great that y-you want to be independent, Norman.<eos> I think that shows character.<eos> Oh, really? Do you, Alex?
I know that.<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> You want me to say it?<eos> What are you gonna do when this Mike guy gets back from New York and says to these two,<eos> "Hey, guess who isn't married to Dan Logan."<eos> She thinks I don't know where they're coming from.<eos> Like a person could actually just, in the course of their normal life, bump into that many people who make balloon animals.<eos> You know what the ironic thing is?<eos> Do you?
It was not my idea.<eos> Believe me.<eos> It was his entirely.<eos> But why?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It's... It's not like Bill not to fight.<eos> A witness was gonna come forward.<eos> Things were gonna be said that would've been bad for Bill, bad for Virginia, and... and it would have been entirely embarrassing to you.<eos> Well, I do want to put all of that behind me.<eos> So does your husband.
What the hell?<eos> Easy, Marty.<eos> The witch chose us three for a reason.<eos> Each of us guarding a different piece of the puzzle!<eos> I knew about the hand, Gary hid the stupid book; now I need you to get your piece!<eos> We didn't trust each other and now look what I done!<eos> Put down the knife!<eos> The heir's gonna help us!<eos> I do know the numbers.<eos> 'Least, I did!
We really got to finish.<eos> -I know. Oh, my gosh.<eos> My mom is going to be so impressed.<eos> Well, that is a beautiful plantain, if I've ever seen one.<eos> Head that way.<eos> Good job.<eos> That's raw, Dad.<eos> This bad boy's done.<eos> Damn! That looks damn good!<eos> We done?
Sorry I messed up your life so bad!<eos> Jennifer, that is not what I meant!<eos> And I'm sorry I'm screwing my life up, too!<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm just waiting for you to say it...<eos> "This is not what we do, Jenny"!<eos> It's not.<eos> You screwed this up.<eos> She needed to know all the risks.<eos> - No, she didn't.
Jennifer, that is not what I meant!<eos> And I'm sorry I'm screwing my life up, too!<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm just waiting for you to say it...<eos> "This is not what we do, Jenny"!<eos> It's not.<eos> You screwed this up.<eos> She needed to know all the risks.<eos> - No, she didn't.<eos> - Yes, she did.
Welcome back, Kyle.<eos> I showed you my moves.<eos> Time to show us yours.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Your turn to free-style.<eos> This wasn't my fault.<eos> Telling the mother.<eos> Stress doesn't just cause arteries to rupture.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - I do.
- This entire meeting was a set up.<eos> It was a set up to get us looking in the wrong direction.<eos> Beck tasked us with putting together a team to locate and disrupt... a meeting between Daish and the cartels.<eos> But mysteriously they won't let us finish it.<eos> Because he's a paid and bought bureaucrat?<eos> Because he thought the real target would be there.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> You two watch the lobby. And you make sure that Mr. Rauf makes it back to the Palace Hotel without incident, okay?<eos> - I know that name.<eos> - Yeah, we all do.
- Anybody talk to them yet?<eos> - They said something about<eos> - wanting a helicopter.<eos> - Yeah, good luck with that.<eos> - Let me get you...<eos> - We should probably get the element of surprise.<eos> - Look, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, right?<eos> I'm just saying it's not exactly Ocean's Eleven in there.<eos> Hey, could you get this guy out of here?<eos> Sorry, I didn't...
Tell me about yourself.<eos> What's your deal? Uh... me?<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> Hey, don't you think that Seo-yeon is much nicer than Ga-in?<eos> Seo-yeon?<eos> She's a fantastic sous chef.<eos> Where're you from?<eos> Oh, it doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does.
And he's sorry.<eos> You are?<eos> [clears throat] Yes.<eos> Sort of.<eos> [ominous sound] [coins clank] [Seth] You get half now and the rest afterwards.<eos> "Sort of"?<eos> I'm not entirely sorry because it's not entirely my fault.<eos> You're entirely a jackass.<eos> I thought you wanted your restaurant to succeed!<eos> Of course, I do!
- But you don't have to.<eos> Look, I don't know anything about your trafficking ring.<eos> And I'm not talking to anyone about it ever again.<eos> Stop, listen...<eos> Thank you, Monsignor.<eos> I know I've put a heavy burden on you, but I have faith that the D.A.'s office will do the right thing.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Please, this has to end.<eos> I want to spare these girls any more exploitation.<eos> We all do.
I hate them. I got one right here.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That's our Tony.<eos> Tony?<eos> His name's Tony, the guy you arrested, and he's a Kackenkopf?<eos> - Yeah. - He had a fake ID, but his real name is Anthony Talamonti.<eos> Oh, my God, it's Tony.<eos> - Seattle Tony?<eos> - You know this guy?<eos> Yeah, she does.
Yeah.<eos> I... see your husband's awake... or... unfrozen, or whatever.<eos> Is he leaving you alone?<eos> - Your husband?<eos> - No.<eos> - I mean Jason.<eos> Right.<eos> Uh... unclear.<eos> I told them I had new information about the Abbies.<eos> Do you?
Every member of our community has a duty to ensure the future of the human race, hmm?<eos> Obviously, there'll be some failures, such as yours. Which is why we need to encourage the First Generation to bear children as quickly as possible.<eos> I understand that.<eos> But you can preserve humanity and try to hold on to some, at the same time.<eos> You do realize you're asking children to bear children.<eos> Ye... it-it's a survival strategy used by numerous societies.<eos> Primitive societies.<eos> Megan, these girls should have a choice.<eos> Lucy has a choice.<eos> Actually, Rebecca, she really doesn't.
Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> If they can learn, let's teach 'em some consequences.<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Hey, think about it... if you kill her, we all die!<eos> Kerry.<eos> If she does control them, is killing her a risk you want to take?<eos> I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it is not what I would advise.<eos> Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?<eos> Of course they do.
Congratulations.<eos> You can invite me to your, uh... anniversary party.<eos> Baby shower.<eos> Look, I don't know how much time we have left.<eos> It could be days.<eos> It could be hours.<eos> But whatever it is, I'm not gonna live it with that kid in charge.<eos> So what I need to know is where you stand.<eos> I don't matter.<eos> No you don't.
Wherever I am... and wherever you are.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Come on.<eos> The last group is moving towards the pods.<eos> Which we hope will work.<eos> There are no guarantees in this life.<eos> You're a surgeon; you know this.<eos> I've had lives in my hands.<eos> Held a human heart, beating.<eos> Did one earlier today, as a matter of fact.
The secretary was a spy.<eos> She just disappeared.<eos> I guess it was really hard for Mr. beeman to talk to her father.<eos> I-i just went over there looking for Henry, and he -- he started telling me this stuff.<eos> Can I drive?<eos> I need more practice.<eos> That's dad's job.<eos> It was worth a shot.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> No, we don't.
To swim far, far out into the ocean so that I can't see the bottom anymore.<eos> To eat geoduck.<eos> Isn't it the one that kinda looks like a p...<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Point is, I've always wanted to do things that scared me.<eos> But, well, it's not so easy to be brazen when the thing that you want, that scares you to death,<eos> is sitting right in front of you.<eos> I scare you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
But, well, it's not so easy to be brazen when the thing that you want, that scares you to death,<eos> is sitting right in front of you.<eos> I scare you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Because I don't wanna be friends.<eos> When I think about what I wanna do most in this world... it's you.<eos> Oh God, that sounded so much more romantic in my head.<eos> Just jump in any time, Nicole, because I really, really don't know how to do this.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
Your will specifies that your second heir is your sister's eldest child.<eos> Only if Louis dies before he is 30, which he will not.<eos> I'm sure, but the point is... .. I know your sister's eldest child.<eos> What?<eos> You remember my late brother?<eos> I'll remember him to my dying day.<eos> Then you must also know that your sister's eldest child was his child, too.<eos> - But that baby died.<eos> - No.<eos> She did not.
I'll remember him to my dying day.<eos> Then you must also know that your sister's eldest child was his child, too.<eos> - But that baby died.<eos> - No.<eos> She did not.<eos> Anna came to me in prison before she went to Australia and told me that child was dead.<eos> Your sister wished to sever any connection between her daughter and you, or anyone else so that the girl could grow up in peace and no-one know her true identity.<eos> But now I would not have you make her your heir unintentionally, so... I thought it right to tell you.<eos> Do you see her?<eos> I do.
Yes, I like where your head's at.<eos> But... I don't know, man.<eos> I've got a bad feeling about this.<eos> We just need to find the weakness in the cage.<eos> What?<eos> What are you do... stop.<eos> Oh, here's the lock.<eos> You just need to wiggle your tiny little spaghetti fingers in there, and wiggle it free.<eos> Okay, I don't have tiny spaghetti fingers, all right?<eos> - Yes, you do.

You do.<eos> Yeah, we just covered this.<eos> You have a very tiny penis.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - You've never seen it hard.<eos> - I've seen it dozens of times.<eos> - Not hard.<eos> I'll just take one of your bobby pins.<eos> - I don't have bobby pins.<eos> - Yes, you do.
What happened to your person?<eos> My person?<eos> My person was busy.<eos> She had company.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Anyway, besides, it's your turn.<eos> Can't you just call your little pretty friend?<eos> Pilar manages her sister's restaurant.<eos> She doesn't have time to pore over every detail of that contract.<eos> Yeah, dude, she does.
The Met Office weather warning remains in place throughout the night, as gusts of wind, some reaching gale-force, continue to batter Scotland.<eos> This weather front from the Atlantic continues to bring heavy rain...<eos> Right... I'm going to turn in.<eos> Bill, Moira, I'm so sorry to burst in like this but a man's just driven off the road by our place.<eos> Oh, my God. Is he...?<eos> Is he badly hurt?<eos> We don't know right now.<eos> we've called an ambulance, but God knows when it's going to get here.<eos> Claire needs some medical things -- she thought you might have some for the animals.<eos> Of course I do.
18 years old.<eos> My goodness, she's lovely.<eos> Fauzi.<eos> What?<eos> A daughter's a blessing.<eos> And look at you.<eos> In the palace.<eos> I always said this is where you were meant to be.<eos> Well, it's only temporary.<eos> But, uh... yes, you did.
I texted my higher-ups at Quantico, and they agreed to release you tonight, for 24 hours, when Halloween officially begins.<eos> - You will wear this anklet. - (BEEPS)<eos> That way, they'll know if you leave the hospital grounds.<eos> Now, at the stroke of midnight, after I've had a few cocktails, danced a little bit, and made out with a couple guys, you will tell us who the killer is.<eos> You will not tell anybody about this arrangement, because if you do, you will be sent back to the asylum like that.<eos> You will wear this costume, and you will keep this mask on at all times.<eos> - Is this a Jason costume?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> With you in this costume, it'll be easy to keep a eye on you, 'cause nobody wants to be Jason on Halloween.<eos> Yes, they do.
- (WHISPERS): Ear hair removal.<eos> And I've got to get to the dry cleaners.<eos> But after I get all that done, I promise I'm gonna come up with a miracle cure.<eos> Dean Munsch, I demand that you have Dr. Brock arrested immediately.<eos> On what charge?<eos> For assaulting me with silver!<eos> And... probably being in cahoots with Denise Hemphill in murdering Chad and a whole bunch of other people with his serial killer hand!<eos> MUNSCH: Chanel, look, I know you are feeling a tad blue right now, but Dr. Brock Holt did not murder Chad.<eos> He has an airtight alibi.<eos> He does?
I must caution you that here in the north, Death can be brutal. And come without warning.<eos> I do hope you understand. The world you find yourselves in.<eos> I have faced far more formidable circumstances, lord benton, And not only have I survived,<eos> I found the experience... Fulfilling.<eos> But I appreciate your concern for our welfare.<eos> It's late.<eos> We are raw from travel.<eos> Perhaps a meeting tomorrow?<eos> I do have a proposition for you.<eos> You yankees always do.
- Now, the Greshamsbury title deeds.<eos> - You mustn't worry about that.<eos> Your lawyers know all there is to know.<eos> It's what my lawyers tell me that brings me here.<eos> See, I gather I've more £90,000 tied up in the Greshamsbury estate.<eos> Something of that kind.<eos> The estate is a fine one.<eos> There is no risk.<eos> - What if I need the money?<eos> - But you don't.
I feel so high up, here.<eos> Will you help me down?<eos> Ahem. Yes.<eos> Mary... .. do you remember when we were last together?<eos> I remember you were very foolish.<eos> Then I've come to repeat my folly.<eos> For all the months we've been apart, nothing has altered me.<eos> Mr Gresham, there are many reasons why I am not worthy of you.<eos> - If you knew them all --<eos> - I do.
Tell Mary everything.<eos> Dr Thorne!<eos> Rest, Sir Louis, I beg you.<eos> Will you do something for me?<eos> I will do anything you ask.<eos> Only this.<eos> Please tell Miss Thorne that I hope I did not offend her.<eos> She thought me a buffoon.<eos> I'm sure she did not.<eos> No, she did.

And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I've been of your contributions.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.<eos> Sheldon.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't sign it yet.<eos> I hear what you're saying, but I've known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.<eos> All right, it's your life.<eos> But you know how this is gonna end.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Someday you'll walk into a mall and shoot everyone?<eos> - Never mind me.<eos> I'm saying this isn't about me.<eos> I'm saying I'm not the reason to keep this place open and neither is Marsha.<eos> If you want to kick her out, kick her out.<eos> She's had her run here.<eos> She was your dad's pleasure chest, and then my dad honored him by keeping her here.<eos> But, yeah, I mean, we don't have to do anything.<eos> Yeah, we don't owe you anything, Marsha.<eos> Nobody does.
Just honestly, I'd rather fend for myself.<eos> - All right, well, it's your choice.<eos> - So, look, I'll just stay here tonight, and, uh, in the morning, I'll get an Uber to Sloan.<eos> I'll be out of your hair and, uh, out of mind soon thereafter, I'm sure.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - How are you, um...?<eos> I mean, are you still working?<eos> Did you go back to work?<eos> - No, Horace, I got laid off in April.<eos> - You did?
I never bought drugs, never gave girls drugs.<eos> I'm not part of that process.<eos> Oh. So now it's a "process."<eos> I never touch drugs.<eos> No, you just knowingly look the other way while three girls die.<eos> Three girls? !<eos> What? !<eos> Jodi Albertson, Kim Murphy.<eos> - They died from the same batch of...<eos> - No, they did not!
No, I quit, okay?<eos> No, forget it.<eos> Man, Dion, you're on parole.<eos> You get caught ripping off a wine warehouse, they'll put you away for 10 years.<eos> You know what?<eos> Your wine is that important to me, T.<eos> Please, stop.<eos> - All right, fine.<eos> - Look, you got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, I do...
I'm thinking our client is guilty.<eos> We've represented guilty clients before.<eos> Not like this.<eos> He went to WikiLeaks about a military action.<eos> That, to me, is treason.<eos> Is it not to you?<eos> Now, then...<eos> I have thought long and hard about this issue, and based on what I have heard, I find there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the espionage charge; therefore, Mr. Dellinger's extradition is hereby approved.<eos> Ma'am, we have one more motion to be considered.<eos> We do?
Not a lot of other people, Dwight.<eos> A lot of other murderers.<eos> It is my understanding that the word "murder" or "homicide"<eos> is reserved for the unlawful killing of other human beings.<eos> My so-called victims were either involved with or already were part of an inferior race, and therefore, it is my defense...<eos> The 6 adults and 2 children under 10 shot to death by the defendant were human in every sense of the word<eos> - Sustained.<eos> Claiming your victims were unworthy of life because they were minorities is not a defense, Mr. Darnell.<eos> Make your point, if you have one.<eos> I do.
He never admitted to being part of zyklon.<eos> He kept it generic Aryan, but yes, there was a name of a guy.<eos> Huh.<eos> Would it be in your notes?<eos> You know, that's a great idea.<eos> Yes, I recorded all our sessions.<eos> And do you remember where those recordings are?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, do you want me to tell you where to find them?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- No, that's bullshit, - That's not true! And you were turned down because of your grades.<eos> English lit, "d." Algebra, "f."<eos> World history, "d."<eos> If you would read Jordan Graff, who is a Harvard law graduate, by the way, you would realize that the public-school currICUlums have been adjusted so that white people do more poorly than minorities!<eos> It's all being done on purpose!<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll read Jordan Graff.<eos> Who is he? He is someone who is helping us regain our fatherland.<eos> Do you know this Jordan Graff, personally?<eos> Yes, I do, very well.
We need cannon fodder.<eos> We need new Chanels for the Green Meanie to attack so he doesn't murder us!<eos> Uh, you already have that, Chanel.<eos> Her name is... me!<eos> The Green Meanie's already tried to murder me twice.<eos> Yeah, and pretty soon, he's probably going to succeed, and then where will we be, Number Five?<eos> It's time to start taking desperate measures.<eos> We need to start interviewing patients.<eos> Why do you think you'd make a good Chanel?<eos> Um, I don't, actually.
Science!<eos> - (All gasp) - Bruno!<eos> - Manchego cheese.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Kermit, Kermit, wait a...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Ignore all of them.<eos> I think you are being very brave.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
We think there are other escapees.<eos> Get out!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> What is happening?<eos> What is the meaning of this?<eos> This bitch was caught escaping and I know there is an accomplice in here.<eos> Right?<eos> So tonight. Until I find the accomplice. I'm gonna have some fun with all of you.<eos> You. Did you know that bitch was escaping?<eos> No I didn't.

-There's Blair and her dad.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> -Hey, guys.<eos> This one. -This one.<eos> Here we go. 15.<eos> Yeah, this is us.<eos> -We've got to make up some ground.<eos> It's a little faster than a walk.<eos> (BOTH COUNT) You want to say 12 or 13?<eos> Just do 212.
Feeling great.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine, you guys.<eos> We just have to be squirrels about this. Jackson:<eos> Couldn't have heard you correctly there.<eos> Oh, you know, squirrels... they store nuts for the winter, right?<eos> But they don't do it all at once.<eos> They do it one nut at a time.<eos> Everyone has their part to play, so everyone just needs to handle their own nut.<eos> We do that, we get all the nuts. - Makes sense.<eos> - Does it, though?
It's really smooth.<eos> Sorry. I...<eos> I have a patient I should check on.<eos> But I'll be back.<eos> What? - Nothing.<eos> - That wasn't flirting.<eos> I mean, I know what flirting looks like.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> All right.<eos> How we doing with the harvest?
It's my specialty.<eos> It's on me.<eos> And I am trying.<eos> I just, I don't know how to make...<eos> So if we had another practice run and we were in the cadaver lab and you had all the time in the world, where would you start?<eos> We don't have time!<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Okay. So what's the first thing you would do?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Yes, you do.
And we'll figure it out, right?<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Um, so, we will talk about it, okay?<eos> But just thank you.<eos> Every surgeon who worked on Mrs. McKay and the baby said the same thing, including Dr. Warren.<eos> That they were backed into a corner and they didn't have a choice.<eos> The only difference with Warren is whether or not you think he's lying, whether you believe he didn't see that door open.<eos> And do you think he was lying?<eos> - No.<eos> - We don't.
!<eos> Yes.<eos> How do you...<eos> D-Do you have any idea how far behind I'll fall?<eos> I'll never get caught up.<eos> What am I supposed to learn from this?<eos> Do you feel even the slightest remorse?<eos> Yes. Yes!<eos> H-How can you ask me that?<eos> Of course I do!
Do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> I made a mistake, Miranda.<eos> People make mistakes.<eos> Surgeons make mistakes.<eos> I don't, not like that.<eos> You made an astonishing error in judgment that I'm trying to accept and forgive.<eos> And it's gonna take me a lot longer than six months.<eos> All bleeding must stop.<eos> Well, I am sorry I disappoint you.<eos> Sometimes it does so at a cost.
- Is Charles okay?<eos> Dr. Karev is just trying to get some air into his lungs.<eos> She's still having contractions.<eos> Okay, uh, increase the magnesium rate.<eos> Uh, you know what?<eos> Um, I'm still confused.<eos> Take me through the deductions again.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> First, the obvious. Do you have any dependants?<eos> Uh, we do.

Pressure's 60 over 40.<eos> Edwards, let's prep for a thoracotomy.<eos> Oh, my G...<eos> Uh, o-okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Edwards, what if we did a balloon catheter?<eos> Robbins was in there.<eos> I saw her.<eos> You saw her?<eos> I did.
And broken on the rack once our Dark Lord catches up to him.<eos> But, Dear Sister... the Dark Lord told us to look after one another.<eos> And I can help you.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Tell me what happened to Mary.<eos> You were there.<eos> He wrenched from her all the powers he had granted her, as if he was turning her inside out.<eos> I do not know how she survived it.<eos> But she did?
- I don't know.<eos> I just can't seem to pull the trigger.<eos> [Cellphone buzzes] Got to go.<eos> - See ya.<eos> [Sighs] Yeah, I think he wants me to be the one to push him to retire, but I know it's got to be his decision.<eos> Frankie confirmed Wayne Fellows' alibi.<eos> Found at least 12 people that said he was at the bar all night.<eos> Let's hope Maura found something.<eos> Please tell us you found some DNA, and I'll... give you 100 bucks.<eos> - I did. - Oh.
And if I am?<eos> Then I get you a job.<eos> And if I'm not?<eos> Then you never see me again.<eos> And the next time you have an incident, you will go to solitary confinement for a month.<eos> So I suggest you go back to your cell and you think long and hard about what you want to accomplish during your time here.<eos> I have to say, I'm glad you've decided to settle rather than fight these suits.<eos> Well, as you can see, things are a little tight around here, so you have us at a disadvantage.<eos> What I have is the fact that you don't want to be talking about having hired a fraud in court for the next six months.<eos> No, we don't, so...
- It's all right here, Harvey.<eos> And if we don't pay him off tonight, he kills that deal tomorrow and we're out of business ten minutes later.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> That's blackmail.<eos> I'm not giving in to blackmail.<eos> Oh, come on, do you think I want to do this?<eos> He's got us by the balls, Harvey.<eos> If we don't pay him, what was everything we went through the other night even for?<eos> Which means right now, we just have to figure out how much we're willing to pay.<eos> No, we don't.
I'm not waiting to get her.<eos> And neither are you.<eos> She's our sister.<eos> As long as I get to kick someone's ass.<eos> That can be arranged.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Right initials, wrong fella.<eos> Robert,<eos> - you don't want to do this.<eos> - Oh, but I do.
Wants to experience it like a local.<eos> And he thinks you're just gonna let him take off like that?<eos> He wants me to retire with him.<eos> What?<eos> Ms. Goodwin?<eos> Yes.<eos> We lost a patient this morning, Lisa Patrick.<eos> Her husband wants to harvest her eggs.<eos> Do we have a protocol for that?<eos> We do.
Eric will be in the hospital for four to five days, maybe a week.<eos> So I guess I'll be seeing you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Got to get back to work.<eos> Sure.<eos> He's a young kid, he's healthy.<eos> He will heal fast.<eos> Now be honest, you kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> I kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> Everybody does.
You gonna share that fruity ass drink?<eos> Oh, come on, Chuck, man. I brought you here to break your funk, not to see you sink deeper into it.<eos> Yeah, Buffalo and New Orleans ain't calling me with no huge contract.<eos> - You got options, brother.<eos> - And so do you.<eos> Option number one is going over there and telling Siefert he's a piece of shit for cutting you like he did. That ain't me.<eos> Well, sometimes we got to do things we don't want to do.<eos> Like you think I wanted to go on that stage and put myself on display like a piece of meat? - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> No, I did not.
I'm trying, man. For my family.<eos> Well, then you got to be strong for them.<eos> Right?<eos> Man, you're Nick Kovac.<eos> They can't tell you shit.<eos> Right?<eos> Fuck Siefert.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> How you know I needed that?<eos> I didn't.
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.<eos> What you got there?<eos> Didn't hear?<eos> Word is, he hit again last night.<eos> - Two dead in the street.<eos> - Who?<eos> Ghost Rider.<eos> You must not be from around here.<eos> Do you know where I can find him?<eos> Nobody does.
And what inspired that decision?<eos> There's still families Alderman Becks hasn't helped out after the tornado.<eos> They need it more than I do.<eos> Is that one of the issues you'll be bringing up in the final debate?<eos> The final debate was last week.<eos> Alderman Becks' campaign told us one more debate was being set right before the election.<eos> Um... this is the first I've heard of it.<eos> Do you mind if we go inside to talk?<eos> I'm freezing.<eos> I do, actually.
It's all right.<eos> See? It's not even chipped.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think you've done enough for one day.<eos> Why don't you take a break?<eos> Rumplestiltskin, what's going on?<eos> This, uh... this isn't like you.<eos> I have a ball to attend to later, and I'm a bit rusty. Will you help me practice?<eos> I... wasn't aware that I had any choices here.<eos> You do.
Seriously, though.<eos> I think it's time we shake things up.<eos> Move to Paris, you know, search for buried treasure in Nepal.<eos> We could fly a hot air balloon across the Sahara.<eos> You know what?<eos> I love all of those ideas, but I just became captain, and you have your P.I. business.<eos> And then there's LokSat.<eos> Exactly.<eos> We have responsibilities, right?<eos> But what if we didn't?
But of course.<eos> Wait. I sense something.<eos> Something powerful.<eos> An unnatural presence in the order of things.<eos> What kind of presence? What kind, indeed?<eos> When is a man not a man?<eos> When his life-force cannot be extinguished, when he cannot die.<eos> Then he is a god.<eos> I think he senses your powers.<eos> Yeah? You do?
Does it bother you?<eos> A bit.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> This fallen woman is dragging you down.<eos> You know what's weird?<eos> I'm more judgmental about my daughter's Christianity than yours. Why is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're a bad person.<eos> I don't want you to feel like you're doing wrong when you're with me.<eos> Yeah, you do.
And yet you have two top partners at your table.<eos> Objection, Your Honor.<eos> I haven't even gotten to my question yet.<eos> Why don't we wait till she gets to her question, then I'll sustain.<eos> I used to work for their firm, Your Honor.<eos> And this case wouldn't even be considered<eos> - unless there was an ulterior motive.<eos> - Objection, Your Honor.<eos> - That has nothing to do with this case.<eos> - But it does, Your Honor.
- We weren't telling anyone.<eos> - We're not "anyone," Mom.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We just wanted to get through Dad's trial.<eos> Is this about Jason?<eos> Wait, who's Jason?<eos> Her investigator.<eos> - You have an investigator?<eos> - Well, her firm does.
You-you mean Locke?<eos> Yes, my apologies...<eos> Locke.<eos> Mr. Agos?<eos> - Do you hate the Florricks?<eos> - No.<eos> But don't you have reason to be angry with the Florricks?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
The Indians scalped my father in front of me.<eos> Rounded up the women, tied us together like livestock, dragged us into the woods.<eos> The Abenaki raped my sister and slit her throat.<eos> All the while, my mother kept saying,<eos> "Your uncles will come for us.<eos> They'll hire the great John Alden to ransom us."<eos> She was waiting for a man to save us.<eos> And I was waiting for you.<eos> But you never came.<eos> No man did.
If they flew to Pearl, they could then sail from there to effect a search and rescue of our ships.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> Just what I said.<eos> Chandler's China adventure ends now.<eos> Sit down, Howard.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Don't tell me to sit down, Allison.<eos> Do you know who the hell you're talking to?<eos> I do.
- Great.<eos> You were expecting me to protest?<eos> We need to shred whatever physical evidence is out there...<eos> Documents, e-mails that prove the president went to war for Liv...<eos> They all need to be destroyed.<eos> Lillian can't publish until she corroborates Andrew's story.<eos> The less that's out there, the better off we'll be.<eos> Thank you for coming when I called.<eos> You didn't call.<eos> Abby did.
I wanted to be with you.<eos> I wanted to start a new life with you.<eos> That's what we both wanted, or at least I thought it was until you said we could be friends.<eos> Friends?<eos> You broke my heart.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mellie...<eos> I really did care about you.<eos> I cared about you, too.<eos> I still do.
Liv is not paying her kidnapper.<eos> David and I don't have any money.<eos> - You're Democrats.<eos> - So that leaves...<eos> You and me.<eos> No.<eos> That leaves you.<eos> I didn't grow up on an estate in Santa Barbara.<eos> I don't have $5 million sitting around.<eos> Yes, you do.
It's the Internal Affairs of the parent agency of the Bureau.<eos> They probably heard what we heard.<eos> They should be defending him, not charging him.<eos> Whoever's doing this wants me here instead of investigating.<eos> There has to be a bigger plan because they want my team distracted.<eos> Do you have a storage unit in Reston, Virginia?<eos> My wife an I had one.<eos> It's been cleared out for years.<eos> Why did you rent a van last week?<eos> I didn't.
Ok, warden, we're 5 minutes out.<eos> Guys, the swatting, the reference to Asher-- this is exactly the larger plan we profiled.<eos> It worked.<eos> Rawdon has another group he's been working from the inside.<eos> By the time we clear Hotch, they'll be gone.<eos> Who's Eric Rawdon?<eos> He's behind this.<eos> Maybe he's your partner.<eos> If that were true, you'd have evidence.<eos> I do.
So... So it's the chemical composition for vinyl.<eos> What's made out of vinyl?<eos> Records?<eos> Bumper stickers. Oh.<eos> I bet this shred scraped off when the two cars collided.<eos> Can you tell me what the bumper sticker says?<eos> Based on a shred that's 3.2 millimeters long?<eos> No.<eos> Ooh, you have something else, don't you?<eos> I do.
- Good...<eos> What did you just say?<eos> What?<eos> Did you just call me Cathy?<eos> No! No, I said... Bathy.<eos> - Oh, bathy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I...<eos> Look, I-I love making love to you, but sometimes I think it would be great if we just lit some candles and... and popped some champagne and took a bathy.<eos> - Oh, do you?
Careful, quicksand.<eos> Somebody!<eos> Drop me a rope!<eos> Come on!<eos> This is a horrible way to die.<eos> Look, in my experience, costumed serial killers are never adequately punished by the law.<eos> Sometimes vigilante justice is the only way. I'm with Chanel.<eos> She killed my boyfriend.<eos> Oh, so I suppose no one cares that your boyfriend murdered my boyfriend?<eos> No one does.
You never saw him again after that?<eos> Everybody in town, including my mom, thought some pervert had taken him.<eos> She was falling apart, crying.<eos> Why didn't I remember what the guy looked like?<eos> Why was I making up this lie?<eos> She still live here?<eos> Moved as soon as she could.<eos> Still thinks I should've done something.<eos> Saved him.<eos> Everybody did.
Do you think we can use it against Amara?<eos> What is this?<eos> The Rod of Aaron.<eos> A Hand of God.<eos> If we're gonna fight her, what better way to arm up than with an actual dose of His power?<eos> It's kicked.<eos> You're out of juice, huh?<eos> We've got jack on another Hand of God, and we've got even less jack on how to save Cass.<eos> If he wants to be saved.<eos> He does.
He does.<eos> Noel, I came when you asked.<eos> You're looking a trifle peaky.<eos> Do you truly have it?<eos> And it's yours... if you hold up your end of the bargain.<eos> I've had a good life... thanks to you.<eos> Very few of the world's secrets I haven't cracked.<eos> It seemed worth a soul... at the time.<eos> Oh.<eos> It always does.
Oh, that's all? Huh.<eos> Okay.<eos> And where is this horn?<eos> Safely hidden, naturally. Yeah.<eos> Crowley, even if we could exorcise Lucifer out of Cass, the Cage is damn near impenetrable.<eos> It took a spell from the Book of the Damned to spring Lucifer, and Rowena hid the book.<eos> And we would need both the book and her to even have a shot.<eos> Did I say this would be easy?<eos> No.<eos> I did not.
Could be.<eos> Or it could be that all the guys that were out there when I was a kid are too busy running companies to have time for hams.<eos> Yeah, or they moved online.<eos> There must be some new kids out there.<eos> I'll be out in a sec.<eos> CQ, CQ, for shit's sake, is anybody out there?<eos> Hey, Cameron and I decided to have a weekly project meeting to streamline the swapmeet integration and we thought that you'd be a valuable addition.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> If you want me there.<eos> Yeah, we do.
But it's hard to turn that into good news.<eos> I want you to come to this meeting.<eos> - Right now?<eos> - Right now.<eos> You must be John Bosworth.<eos> Diane Gould.<eos> I'll be your backup this afternoon.<eos> Oh, pleasure to meet you.<eos> Didn't know I needed backup.<eos> Well, you don't, of course.
Air conditioning like God intended it.<eos> Where was God when Nolan Ryan left that one hanging for Will Clark the other day?<eos> You want to get that?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> This is more important.<eos> Yeah, hey, we appreciate the extra attention, but don't you fellas have a receptionist?<eos> Of course we do.<eos> She's at lunch.<eos> Late lunch.<eos> We do a lot of business with the East Coast.
Left gold coins on the eyes of one of his victims last night.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> I didn't fail every course that i took in college.<eos> Warrants out for his arrest on no less than 20 murders, and those are just the ones that they can connect him to.<eos> Mr. church just became our top priority.<eos> "Our" is not going to be enough for this guy.<eos> Ok, Felicity.<eos> Church runs with a crew, and yours is not coming back.<eos> -You don't know that.<eos> -Yes, i do.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Excuse me. - Mm.<eos> Have Iveeen kidnapped?<eos> Unclear.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I know that this is hard to believe.<eos> No, that's just it, Barry.<eos> I do believe you.<eos> You... do?
As usual, I have had a terrible time in your horrible loft with all of you idiot people.<eos> Sam, wait!<eos> If you take your bike, will you relock mine?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, Genevieve, I am so sorry.<eos> Don't be, don't be.<eos> I wanted a resolution and I got one.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to call my childhood phone number and scream at whoever picks up. I'll see you Monday.<eos> Wait, I got the job?<eos> Of course you did.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> Whatever's inside that vault, promise me you won't set free.<eos> We need to know exactly what we're dealing with so we can fight it.<eos> You can't fight it.<eos> Do I even want to know?<eos> Will it deter you from going in?<eos> Nope.<eos> Then, no, you don't.
And always was a woman?<eos> (chuckles) Shit.<eos> Whew.<eos> (Rhonda chuckles) Can I just say one thing?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I- - I believe in equal rights for everybody.<eos> That's what I believe in.<eos> I mean, for everybody.<eos> - I know you think you do.<eos> - No, I do.
(chuckles) Shit.<eos> Whew.<eos> (Rhonda chuckles) Can I just say one thing?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I- - I believe in equal rights for everybody.<eos> That's what I believe in.<eos> I mean, for everybody.<eos> - I know you think you do.<eos> - No, I do.<eos> I really do.
No, I didn't know you knew him.<eos> Oh, yeah, for years.<eos> Like, way back when he was doing his show at the theater, I used to bring him waters.<eos> I can't believe that you didn't know that I know Doug.<eos> You totally should've told him.<eos> He would have lost his mind.<eos> Anyway, congratulations.<eos> That is so cool that he's giving you this opportunity.<eos> I... I mean, I thought you didn't want to be a pot guy.<eos> I don't.
I intern here too.<eos> My friend Diana got me the gig.<eos> I guess I know why you're here,<eos> Kim, Becca...<eos> Whoever.<eos> You're her sister.<eos> I won't pretend to know what you're going through... But stay away from my friends.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Do you know where I found this?<eos> Yeah... you do.
Get it done.<eos> Keep an eye on nick.<eos> I'll be back as soon as i can.<eos> Mm-hmm. Look i know this is difficult for both of you.<eos> More difficult for nick.<eos> Well he brought this on himself.<eos> Did he?<eos> Let me give you a bit of advice.<eos> Stay out of it.<eos> He did this in a precinct.
Us.<eos> Because you disappointed me.<eos> You all disappointed me.<eos> No, look.<eos> I know I'm a disappointment, but you're wrong about humanity.<eos> They are your greatest creation because they're better than you are.<eos> Yeah, sure, they're weak and they cheat and steal and...destroy and disappoint.<eos> But they also give and create and they sing and dance and love.<eos> And above all, they never give up.<eos> But you do.
I don't care!<eos> I got you a beer.<eos> I don't know if you drink.<eos> I do now.<eos> Well...<eos> I don't know... if Chuck is leaning our way.<eos> You don't know?<eos> If we do get Lucifer for the added muscle, then...maybe he'll play ball.<eos> I thought they hated each other.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Open bar, choir, Sabbath cover band, and Gary Busey reading the eulogy.<eos> Done.<eos> And for my ashes, I like it here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, as far as eternal resting places go.<eos> Come on.<eos> No chick-flick moments.<eos> Yeah, you love chick flicks.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I do.
♪ But don't forget that love's a game ♪ I know.<eos> I'm gonna go get you some water.<eos> Chuck?<eos> What?<eos> Chuck?<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> Brother, I...<eos> In the beginning... it was just you and me, and we were family.<eos> I loved you, and I thought -- I knew... that you loved me.<eos> I did.
I'm gonna go get you some water.<eos> Chuck?<eos> What?<eos> Chuck?<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> Brother, I...<eos> In the beginning... it was just you and me, and we were family.<eos> I loved you, and I thought -- I knew... that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
That's strange.<eos> The last time we saw those two together,<eos> Atticus Fink was refusing to buy the lot because it was haunted.<eos> A failing studio, the ghost of an actor, a mummy, a headless horseman.<eos> What does it all mean, Fred?<eos> I've been doing a lot of thinking, Velma.<eos> It's like I've been walking in a thick fog.<eos> But suddenly, seeing that mummy, everything fell into place.<eos> I have got the answer.<eos> - You do?
I can't believe you actually did it.<eos> But who are they?<eos> And why did you wait for me to get here to find out?<eos> Mr. Brickton, if my time in show business has taught me anything, it's how to do things with flair.<eos> You sure there aren't more of them out there?<eos> From my security feed, there's at least a mummy runnin' around.<eos> I'm sure these are the only two.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I know who they are.<eos> You do?
Hey, hey. If they ask, she's 21, all right?<eos> Everybody put your hands in the air... and wave 'em like you just don't care!<eos> The hell?<eos> - What up, boys?<eos> - Beer Pong!<eos> - He's cute.<eos> - Hey, how we doing, boss?<eos> Nikki has a thing for cops.<eos> It's true.<eos> I do.
Okay, fine.<eos> You wanna talk about something new?<eos> Brenda Sanders.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> You gotta be kidding.<eos> You're going to bring up Brenda here?<eos> I told you, I didn't sleep with her.<eos> Well, I had to walk around with the whole town thinking you did.<eos> - No one thought that.<eos> - Oh, we all did.
Uh, Henry, uh... Henry's across the street.<eos> I think he and Matthew are inventing some game.<eos> And Paige is at Bible study.<eos> I went to EST.<eos> What, uh... What made you do that?<eos> Told you I was gonna go.<eos> So?<eos> So...<eos> I see why you like it.<eos> You do?
- Had a kid Odell's age.<eos> Didn't want to risk her identifying with him.<eos> - Used a preempt. - Mm.<eos> You didn't preempt Keith Johnson.<eos> He had a 17-year-old child, as well, but he was white.<eos> Are you reading my notes?<eos> White jurors are more likely to incarcerate black defendants.<eos> Tess.<eos> ADA Bonotto knows the stats on jury diversity.<eos> We all do.
One -- put aside your personal feelings when assessing a client.<eos> Two -- he was bankrupted by this case.<eos> Because he fired like 10 of his attorneys when they told him to take a plea deal.<eos> Five of his attorneys, and don't speak unless called on.<eos> Now, we're joining this mid-trial.<eos> The prosecution is halfway through the case, and has done a pretty good job with the jury.<eos> So, how do we undo that?<eos> Really?<eos> I'm handing you a tabloid murder case, and no one wants to sit with me at the table?<eos> I do.
You were right about that.<eos> Not 'cause he was gonna beat me that day.<eos> Because he was gonna beat me for the rest of my life.<eos> And looking ahead to that, feeling broken bones before they even happen...<eos> I made a decision.<eos> I sat with that hammer for hours, and when he came home, I stood up, and I hit him over and over again until I saw brains.<eos> And still I didn't feel... that that made up for all the times that he hit me.<eos> So I hit him some more.<eos> You want me to say I'm sorry, that I regret my actions.<eos> But I don't.
Did Bonnie tell you that?<eos> Laurel.<eos> Don't be mad at her.<eos> She just worries about me.<eos> Just like you.<eos> Do you trust her?<eos> Completely.<eos> She's my best friend.<eos> I didn't think I needed one.<eos> I did.
Blame me.<eos> None of this is on you.<eos> No, I... I don't blame you.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> He needed to see the person she really is.<eos> Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.<eos> I just wanted to go on record as soon as possible.<eos> We understand.<eos> As long as you know any statement you make here can be used as evidence at the formal disciplinary hearing.<eos> I do.
No, I'm in my car. Where are you?<eos> Leaving the funeral home.<eos> - Oh. How was it?<eos> - Lovely.<eos> Stupid question.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Have you seen Frank?<eos> - No.<eos> You'll call me when you do?<eos> If I do.
Come home with me.<eos> What?<eos> She needs to hear you say it...<eos> That Sam forced you to keep it from her.<eos> I could've told her, anyway.<eos> You couldn't... because Sam got into your head... just like he did to me.<eos> This is a woman who wants me dead.<eos> Because she blames you for the baby, and that's fair.<eos> You know that.<eos> Of course I do.
You protect me.<eos> And I just want to do the same for you.<eos> How's...<eos> How's Meggy?<eos> Is she good to you?<eos> Very.<eos> Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.
And I just want to do the same for you.<eos> How's...<eos> How's Meggy?<eos> Is she good to you?<eos> Very.<eos> Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.<eos> I really did.
He was absent from class today.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll check in with his other professors, then.<eos> Wallace Mahoney was an old client of mine, someone who was out of my life.<eos> And they think Wes shot him?<eos> - His father?<eos> - Biological father.<eos> My God.<eos> You knew about this.<eos> - Of course she did.
What about when I needed you?<eos> When I called you over and over again.<eos> I didn't want to involve you.<eos> And you're fine involving me now?<eos> ! 'Cause I'm in love with you.<eos> My God. Stop!<eos> - You know I always have been.<eos> - No. You know, I don't know anything<eos> - about you!<eos> - You do.
Any questions for me, Wes?<eos> Did I pass?<eos> How'd it go?<eos> I've been cleared to testify.<eos> Yeah!<eos> I knew our boy wasn't cray-cray.<eos> The State calls Wes Gibbins to the stand.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
- and not like him.<eos> - You do know me.<eos> Parts of you, but guess what, Connor...<eos> I want to know everything about the guy that I'm with...<eos> The good and the bad...<eos> That's what love is.<eos> No, I think love is letting a guy stomp on your heart and still being there for him when another guy rejects him!<eos> You think that letting me cry on your shoulder is proof that you love me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Because I do.
Just keep an eye on the opposition.<eos> Did you know Julia was on drugs?<eos> Well?<eos> Did you know or not?<eos> Rachel:<eos> I want to see you.<eos> Mom?<eos> Has Dad left already?<eos> We argued.<eos> You did?
I'll see what I can do.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Have you been in here long?<eos> I got seven years for dealing.<eos> I've been here a year.<eos> - Were you living in Marseille?<eos> - Yes, Félix Pyat.<eos> - You wouldn't know it.<eos> - I do.
You're doing a great job.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't forget to vote.<eos> - Ladies.<eos> - I'm voting for you.<eos> Thank you. Don't forget.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Our neighborhood needs to change.<eos> Of course it does.
I am being wrongly accused.<eos> Then why did you go to the other room with Dumpy that night?<eos> I went to use the toilet.<eos> But you spent quite some time in the room!<eos> Yes, but... - I don't want an explanation, ma'am!<eos> I just want an answer, a clear cut answer!<eos> Yes, I was there for some time.<eos> So, when you went into the room to use the washroom who shut the door?<eos> I don't remember<eos> You did!
One drink - Huh!<eos> At the restaurant.<eos> And one<eos> - One?<eos> In the room<eos> - Yes.<eos> Out in the restaurant you struck an obscene conversation with Rajvir to which the manager is a witness.<eos> What was that about?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> You don't?
Did he force you?<eos> No. he didn't force me.<eos> He didn't pay me.<eos> We liked each other.<eos> We did it because we wanted to.<eos> Right.<eos> After that, your close acquaintances which also includes Vishwa, testified before the police that you have had other relationships.<eos> Did you have 'sexual relations' with all of them?<eos> Some of them<eos> - So you did.
No. he didn't force me.<eos> He didn't pay me.<eos> We liked each other.<eos> We did it because we wanted to.<eos> Right.<eos> After that, your close acquaintances which also includes Vishwa, testified before the police that you have had other relationships.<eos> Did you have 'sexual relations' with all of them?<eos> Some of them<eos> - So you did.<eos> You did.
That on the night of March the first this is exactly what Rajvir Singh and his friends would have naturally presumed about you.<eos> That you are fairly promiscuous and it wouldn't really matter to you if you went to bed with one more guy.<eos> I understand that they are not mature enough to understand that whenever it happened before - happened with your consent.<eos> Without any money being involved, without any coercion.<eos> But the prosecution has proved that you're a woman of questionable character.<eos> And since you were a woman of questionable character in the eyes of the accused Rajvir Singh and his friends on that day, at that moment, what did you do to make it clear that right now I am not interested in sex?<eos> What did you say?<eos> I refused<eos> - What did you say?<eos> What exactly did you do?
Answer the question.<eos> I know all about your mistakes.<eos> You took money<eos> - Objection, your honor.<eos> You want to humiliate me like Minal.<eos> Answer my question!<eos> Did you take money?<eos> Did you demand money?<eos> You want to humiliate me publicly just to prove that we took money.<eos> You did!
You took money<eos> - Objection, your honor.<eos> You want to humiliate me like Minal.<eos> Answer my question!<eos> Did you take money?<eos> Did you demand money?<eos> You want to humiliate me publicly just to prove that we took money.<eos> You did!<eos> You did take money!<eos> Of course you did.
Carry on, Mr. Deepak.<eos> Okay, let me ask you another question?<eos> . Once you saw that Minal is making a drink for herself Didn't you feel that she might be one of 'those' girls and you should leave!<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> Do women in your family drink alcohol?<eos> Only the men drink.<eos> Your mother?<eos> Your sister?<eos> Do they drink?<eos> Women from good family don't!
I don't know of any such place.<eos> I followed you.<eos> Right inside.<eos> I saw you talking to those two girls.<eos> One of them were playing with your hat, the hat I bought you.<eos> No, you were dreaming.<eos> You saw the state I was in yesterday.<eos> How could I have gone out in that condition?<eos> I saw you with my own two eyes.<eos> No, you didn't.
I didn't think you were coming back.<eos> Harry.<eos> Reg.<eos> They begged me to stay, Harry.<eos> Sergeant Thomas - Taffy, we called him - he said I was an "asset to the force".<eos> Did he now?<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Right, I best be off.<eos> Don't want to miss my train.<eos> No, no, you don't.
I thought it was okay to date within the group.<eos> Oh.<eos> No, no, no. I-<eos> - I was just wondering-- is there anything you'd like to share?<eos> I think Gloria pretty much covered it.<eos> [laughter] [therapist] Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> Um, Pilar, yeah, since we're on the subject, do you miss being intimate with Oscar?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Don't tell me what to do.<eos> You should have been here!<eos> You really want me to move out?<eos> I didn't know you were there.<eos> - I know you're lying.<eos> It's time.<eos> - Oh, for God's sake!<eos> I'm done.<eos> I love my dad.<eos> And I did.
You were not yet in the habit of using taxis.<eos> You were driving home from a bar when you struck and killed a pedestrian.<eos> Your blood alcohol content was measured at .13.<eos> You were arrested for vehicular homicide in the second degree and sentenced to four years at the Great Meadow Correctional Facility.<eos> On the plus side, your prints landed in AFIS.<eos> When you were in prison, there was not one single bombing in New York.<eos> You got out July 2015.<eos> 13 months later, the Bensonhurst Bomber starts blowing things up again.<eos> You have to admit, that's a little strange.<eos> No, I don't.
No, I haven't.<eos> I haven't.<eos> Captain.<eos> There's been another explosion.<eos> Pipe bomb in a book deposit box outside a library here in Flushing.<eos> Two people killed in the blast, half dozen more injured.<eos> It's another bleach-based compound and it's another public detonation.<eos> Obviously, it's our guy.<eos> I thought we had Nathan Resor under surveillance.<eos> We did.
- It is.<eos> Maybe ditch the Converse and hoodie once in a while, and let people see you're a girl.<eos> Hey, this is what all the kids wear.<eos> Who wants to tell her?<eos> Yes.<eos> What is your relationship to the victim?<eos> Is that something that has to happen right now?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Didn't know it bothered you.<eos> I-It doesn't.
How do we know him?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Dad?<eos> You're the puppet guy that tried to sue us two years and three businesses ago by saying we injured you.<eos> She broke my puppet.<eos> Wait, we never had sex.<eos> Did we?<eos> Do you wiggle a lot?<eos> I do.<eos> But we didn't.
If it means ending the war one day sooner,<eos> Amaya would happily make that sacrifice.<eos> But she doesn't have to.<eos> Look, I know you and your team think we're a group of irresponsible losers, but I know Ray Palmer, and he has a plan to get out of that bunker.<eos> We just need to give him time...<eos> Which means giving the Nazis time.<eos> I'm calling in the strike.<eos> I can't let you do that.<eos> You don't have the authority.<eos> Yes, she does.
No doubt, it fell out of the Temporal Zone.<eos> No sign of anyone.<eos> Well, the power core looks exposed.<eos> That mean what I think it means?<eos> Only one way to find out.<eos> Ah. Thought you'd never ask.<eos> Back up, everyone.<eos> Ah, what's next?<eos> Don't you think that's enough incineration for one day, Mr. Rory?<eos> No, I do not, Professor.
- I don't know.<eos> Either our food's ready or this guy's trying to call us.<eos> Hey, how... how do... How do I answer?<eos> I...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's him.<eos> He's even uglier than the last time we saw him.<eos> 65 of your years ago, you saved me from capture.<eos> Listen, you don't need to thank us.<eos> Yeah, he does.
But you have to live with those differences because I can't change it again.<eos> But at least you'll know.<eos> And you all deserve that choice.<eos> So you decided it was okay to change things when someone in your family dies, but when it's someone in my family...<eos> I'm gonna go talk to him.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you working on?<eos> These are the gauntlets for my suit.<eos> And you probably know nothing about that.<eos> - Do you?
Go.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Uh, where were we? - Um...<eos> Cisco.<eos> We should go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - That.<eos> Yeah, why'd you open a breach?<eos> - I didn't.
I don't want you to train her, okay?<eos> I brought her here for you to talk her out of it, not talk her into it, all right, Ramon?<eos> You... you should talk to her.<eos> You're a meta.<eos> Yeah, which makes me the last person she should talk to about not using her powers.<eos> Okay, Snow...<eos> Caitlin...<eos> You and her, you've always had such a special relationship.<eos> You talk to her.<eos> - No, we don't.
I did everything I could to save your father.<eos> Well, you lost your daughter at the same time.<eos> You're the one who went away, Caitlin.<eos> Because I had to.<eos> You realize you never acted like my mother again after Dad got sick?<eos> You would barely even look at me.<eos> I... couldn't handle the pain.<eos> My work got me through it.<eos> Losing someone like that, you have no idea what that feels like.<eos> Actually, I do.
Dreams?<eos> Saving people, becoming a speedster.<eos> He called himself Kid Flash.<eos> Kid Flash, he... he said that name, specifically?<eos> He's in trouble, isn't he?<eos> If Wally's having dreams of being Kid Flash, then he's in trouble, yeah, but don't worry, okay, we'll figure it out.<eos> - I'll see you later.<eos> - All right.<eos> ♪♪♪ "The Flash 3x06" ♪♪♪ ♪♪" Shade"♪ ♪ ♪" OriginalAirDateonNovember15,2016"♪<eos> Yeah, we do.
The two of you were a brother-sister superhero crime-fighting team.<eos> Why didn't you tell us this before?<eos> You didn't want to know about your Flashpoint lives.<eos> But look, listen to me, you got hurt, all right?<eos> You got hurt bad.<eos> So what?<eos> That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster.<eos> I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.
Why didn't you tell us this before?<eos> You didn't want to know about your Flashpoint lives.<eos> But look, listen to me, you got hurt, all right?<eos> You got hurt bad.<eos> So what?<eos> That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster.<eos> I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
No, no, no, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You're not hearing what he's saying.<eos> He's telling us it's not safe.<eos> Who cares what Barry's saying?<eos> How do we even know he's telling the truth?<eos> Wally, come on, this isn't because of the particle accelerator, it's because of Dr. Alchemy.<eos> It's the same thing that happened to Frankie Kane.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, we do.
God, I swear I fixed the security system.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> HR.<eos> Apologies.<eos> HR.<eos> See? Ah.<eos> What you've just been witness to was my partner's likeness, Randolf Morgan.<eos> Okay, I see what's going on here.<eos> You don't have facial transmogrification on this planet, do you?<eos> No, we certainly do not.
You got it.<eos> We're moving in.<eos> Just remember, once you get in there, we're not gonna have eyes<eos> Copy that.<eos> Of course, dude uses an abandoned subway to set up shop.<eos> Of course he does.<eos> Where's Grodd when you need him?<eos> Gro... Gorilla Grodd?<eos> You have sentient gorillas on your Earth too?<eos> Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, we do, many.
Okay.<eos> But "alchemy" is a relatively common phrase.<eos> It'll have hundreds of hits.<eos> Then search for an uncommon one.<eos> - Such as?<eos> - Savitar.<eos> Savitar?<eos> Get searching.<eos> So, they don't know why she took Julian?<eos> No, they don't.
Julian's awake.<eos> He knows it was me.<eos> He knows what I did.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I just wanted to see if you wanted to talk about...<eos> I don't.
Actually, it's the first thing that's made sense to me in a long while.<eos> Ever since I killed Andy.<eos> You think you need to be punished?<eos> I know I do.<eos> Lyla, I didn't have to pull that trigger, but I did.<eos> Something's wrong with me, baby.<eos> Then let me help you.<eos> We will figure this out together.<eos> When I thought lawton killed Andy, all I wanted to do was bring his murderer to justice.<eos> I still do.
Intelligence officers couldn't get it out of him, so... I tried to do it my way.<eos> You put a beating on him.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about that decision.<eos> Particularly since you've been on the other side of that beat-down, right?<eos> Because I screwed up again.<eos> That's my life, man, and now you asking me to relive my latest and greatest.<eos> That's right, Rene.<eos> If you want to help us, if you want to give us anything that could bring down Church, I'm afraid you're gonna have to.<eos> Ok.<eos> What do I do?
We have to find Claybourne.<eos> We were hoping there was something here that could help.<eos> Like ashes?<eos> Those look like crematorium ashes.<eos> The question is whose?<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I got to go, so you guys need to run a DNA test on these ashes and bone fragments to find out who this person was and why Prometheus is keeping their remains.<eos> You guys know how to run a DNA sequencer, right?<eos> No.<eos> Of course you don't.
But look at you here.<eos> I mean, look at these offices.<eos> You come to us, and you'll get the best office on the floor.<eos> What else?<eos> You can have the gavel. And $12 million in PAC money.<eos> And who do you think will be president?<eos> Or you can stay a Republican, and Red will run someone against you from the right.<eos> That's what happens to moderates now.<eos> You know that.<eos> We did it!
- Why?<eos> Because ladies are pretty.<eos> They're like angels, all of them.<eos> - Hey, he's right, though.<eos> Online dating does not work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's the worst.<eos> Yeah, well, the problem is they match you up based on, like, shared background and common interests, you know, so you're like, oh, it's great, we have so many common interests, and it turns out, people don't really connect based on common interest.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - And what does?
- Hi, Sylvia.<eos> Where's Pete?<eos> Oh, don't ask that, they punch you in the face here.<eos> - Shut up, Kurt!<eos> - Fuck you, man.<eos> Hey, what the...<eos> Hey, hey, what is going on in here?<eos> - It's lively in here.<eos> So what happened?<eos> Did...
But not you.<eos> You went out, and you go out on the ice, and you fall down and you fall down.<eos> You never made the team, but you...<eos> You never regretted it.<eos> You remember that, Pete?<eos> Remember...<eos> Remember when you...<eos> when you went out for hockey?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I remember that.<eos> No, you don't.
I sucked at it, but I loved it.<eos> The guys in hockey were cooler than the guys in baseball.<eos> The baseball guys, they were just always uptight.<eos> And baseball is too clean.<eos> Hockey was messy.<eos> And yeah, we were all a bunch of losers, but the tryouts were so much fun and when I got cut, I didn't care.<eos> And I told you that, and you said, "Yeah, okay.<eos> Fuck 'em, do what you want."<eos> That happened!<eos> - Did it?
I'm just trying to direct you to be more cool because that's what this era was about.<eos> - That's how they sound to me.<eos> What do you mean by "more cool"?<eos> I don't get that feel from our track.<eos> Am I alone in this?<eos> Really? No one?<eos> -Girl,yougot tolisten.<eos> Open the ears, close the mouth. He's telling us to lay back, stop be so,<eos> "Hey, girl, yeah, whoo, yeah!" - I just don't know what you're saying, Lucian, baby.<eos> I just don't.
It's no surprise you were a little rattled.<eos> I mean, someone around here has to worry about money. Mm.<eos> - Mary, are you in there? - What?<eos> What are you doing? - Going.<eos> - Where?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> Somewhere new.<eos> - D.C., maybe. - Why?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> - It does.
I'm asking if we are good.<eos> If we are good people doing good things for this world.<eos> Jason was good.<eos> I know that.<eos> I know he wouldn't have done bad things to people, so whatever it is that he was doing, I know it was good.<eos> Did you ever go to Peru with him?<eos> A few times.<eos> And you saw him doing these things like feeding the poor?<eos> Yeah, taking care of sick people.<eos> I did.
Whose house is this?<eos> Yours. It belongs to a member.<eos> They're working in San Diego for the next 18 months, so it's empty.<eos> Your mother won't know it's ours.<eos> I could see you at that desk, studying, college applications.<eos> Where do you want to go?<eos> Uh, NYU.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'll bet you'll get in. Scholarship.<eos> You just need a room of your own, right?<eos> Everyone does.
- No.<eos> But you've got it? Yeah, I think it would probably be... back there, maybe.<eos> - Okay. - Diagonally, straight back.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Sir?<eos> Do you need help?<eos> So then Sarah asked me if I'd seen you that night.<eos> She did.
Today we have much to celebrate.<eos> December 29th will forever be marked as the day our book was finished, and the day our lives truly began.<eos> What could be more symbolic of new life than the three services that Sarah and I will perform today?<eos> Recommitment of a Denier, a wedding, and the taking of vows.<eos> Please forgive this Denier.<eos> Forgive her wanderings.<eos> And allow The Light back into her soul.<eos> Let the bonding of these hands be a symbol of the bond that you have to each other.<eos> Do you accept The Light into your heart?<eos> I do.

Carrying on?<eos> How?<eos> Congress?<eos> Mr Robinson's wife?<eos> It's why I resigned.<eos> I couldn't look people in the face.<eos> I've known for months.<eos> Papa doesn't know.<eos> He just knows he's been dismissed. He doesn't know why.<eos> Emily does.
You must be doing great.<eos> Why the hell did you tell me you can't pay me back.<eos> What do you say now?<eos> Mr. Seven<eos> It will sort itself out, but it's not time yet.<eos> I fuckin' made the time, I can also change it.<eos> Mr.Seven, drink!<eos> Take out the cash and I call them off.<eos> I don't have the money for you.<eos> Yeah, he doesn't.
Don't listen to him.<eos> He says crazy things all the time.<eos> - Watch.<eos> Marco.<eos> - Polo.<eos> So, uh, what are you guys talking about?<eos> Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you're dating.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I specifically asked you not to do that.<eos> - We didn't.
No.<eos> I don't really go out much.<eos> No?<eos> I was in this...<eos> We were homebodies.<eos> Pretty much just hung out at his place or at snooty restaurants with his bitchy friends.<eos> I feel like a middle-aged shut-in.<eos> - That's no fun.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My crew does a Boystown crawl every other week.
And look, I have fake ID.<eos> - What is this shit?<eos> - So I don't end up in prison.<eos> But that other asshole is headed for jail.<eos> - Who are you talking about?<eos> - An old friend.<eos> You didn't tell him, did you?<eos> - Tell him what?<eos> - About me.<eos> No, I didn't.
Just like me, except I have no tie.<eos> - Where did you get the watch?<eos> - I bought it. Why?<eos> I just wondered.<eos> Want to go on the big wheel?<eos> Shall we tell each other stuff?<eos> Yeah. What kind of thing?<eos> I don't know, where you're from, what you like to eat, your favorite movie...<eos> Because apart from smoking joints and fucking, I know nothing about you.<eos> Sure you do.
That is why I'm here.<eos> - This way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I found our suspect.<eos> Her name is Jordan Karfton, and she lives on Shula Lane.<eos> How did the snake removal go?<eos> It was good.<eos> It was good.<eos> Ms. Karfton, you don't know us, but...<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
Okay, there's gotta be something we can do.<eos> Something I can do.<eos> I was the one that suggested it in the first place.<eos> Do we have $20,000?<eos> What?<eos> Monte knows this attorney who specializes in helping people get off the list, and that's the discount rate.<eos> Okay, how does this help you?<eos> Well, if he can get Gabe's record expunged, it's like he was never on the list and then we did nothing wrong.<eos> All right, well, I hate to tell you this, honey, but we don't have $20,000.<eos> We do on a line of credit on the house...
Happy anniversary.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - Well, goodnight.<eos> - Night.<eos> - Night!<eos> - Good night, my babies.<eos> Idiot.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> You really want that?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
And alive.<eos> I really think I would have killed myself if... if you didn't tell me that you love me.<eos> That meant so much.<eos> The fact that someone as beautiful as you are loves me.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> You're like my reason for living.<eos> I do love you and want you to get better, but... not for me... but for yourself.<eos> As long as I have you, I can do that.<eos> I do have you, right?<eos> Yes, you do.
Okay.<eos> We're friends of Kyle Snow.<eos> Do you remember him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He killed that lady, right?<eos> He was found guilty, but we don't think he was given a fair trial.<eos> Kyle says he was with you at the rec center on the day that Mrs. Johnson was murdered.<eos> And you were watching a Clippers game.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Maybe he's the one that handles the finances.<eos> That's what Kelly did.<eos> Right before she left me.<eos> She started moving money around and hiding it.<eos> If I were paying more attention, I would have known she was gonna divorce me.<eos> Hey, why aren't you dancing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just too dumb, I guess.<eos> So, how could Molloy forget giving this statement to Kyle's lawyer?<eos> Maybe he didn't.
- Previously on The Fosters...<eos> - You think you can help me?<eos> We talked to your mom, and she said that there was a witness.<eos> Kyle:<eos> Patrick Molloy, he worked at the rec center.<eos> That's where I was the afternoon Mrs. Johnson was killed.<eos> I do want you to get better, but not for me but for yourself.<eos> Well, as long as I have you I can do that.<eos> - I do have you, right?<eos> - Yes, you do.
- benefits from some other friend?<eos> - Yeah, I can.<eos> I can get all the benefits I want, any time I want from any friend too.<eos> Good, then what do you need me for?<eos> I mean, you don't think I'm good enough for you anyway.<eos> - Why would you say that?<eos> - I think you know.<eos> Actually, I'm pretty sure I don't!<eos> You think I'm dumb, Emma.<eos> Why do you...
It's tradition, but it's not a rule.<eos> And we've got a hanging arm, which you need to beat Palomar Alliance.<eos> Mariana.<eos> - Okay, deal.<eos> - Great.<eos> There's just one problem.<eos> - Our arm doesn't work.<eos> - Wait. Are you kidding me?<eos> But here's the thing: Palomar doesn't think it works.<eos> - Because it doesn't.
Please, go ahead and call me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Thank you for your time, Mr. Harvey.<eos> You have a good day.<eos> I'll get the door.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you think?<eos> He's a nut-job, it doesn't make him a murderer.<eos> So, did you figure out your room situation?<eos> Uh... Yeah, I did.
Put them over there.<eos> Keep them coming, boys!<eos> We're up and running, getting new customers by the truckload.<eos> All right, let's get these boxes moving.<eos> What happened?<eos> They came in the middle of the night and took everything we had.<eos> Ration cards, food, clothes... our house.<eos> Told us we had four hours to move.<eos> Said we worked for them now.<eos> - Who did?
You put a suicidal mission in office, and I took advantage of it.<eos> We are public enemies number one and two.<eos> The people don't trust us.<eos> That's because they've been poisoned.<eos> We'll change their minds.<eos> You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
I was... No, this is...<eos> this is great.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Why did you change your mind?<eos> Eli.<eos> He said you wanted something big.<eos> Hey, let's go... let's go say hi to some people.<eos> Why did you invite Stavo?<eos> I thought he creeped you out.<eos> He does and I didn't.
No, he's barely surviving now.<eos> If the beam destroys him before we have our prize, it is lost to us forever.<eos> Come now, Deathstroke, where is your spirit of hospitality?<eos> Put him in the Presidential Suite.<eos> Holy garbage truck, Gotham City is filthy with criminals.<eos> Holy what?<eos> Why are you talking like that?<eos> Wait, you don't usually wear a cape, do you, Cyborg?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
How can you say you don't take care of people?<eos> You've been taking care of me my entire life.<eos> You're fierce and you are strong, and you would stand up for anyone that you love.<eos> You're like a big, scary mama bear.<eos> I'm gonna Jackass into these melons!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> You're my mama bear, girl.<eos> I wish I had someone in my life who cared about me the way you guys care about each other.<eos> Oh, don't.<eos> - You do. - I just...
You're like a big, scary mama bear.<eos> I'm gonna Jackass into these melons!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> You're my mama bear, girl.<eos> I wish I had someone in my life who cared about me the way you guys care about each other.<eos> Oh, don't.<eos> - You do. - I just...<eos> I've been a cop<eos> - for five years and...<eos> - You do.
You have a gun?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> But it's locked.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> We were just playing.<eos> It went off.<eos> Did I kill him?<eos> No.<eos> Peter, no, you didn't.
I just mean you're in the Army.<eos> I imagine...<eos> Well, you need one in the Army.<eos> You don't need one here.<eos> Well, every day, someone's kid is in an O.R. with a gunshot wound.<eos> Every single day.<eos> When are people gonna learn?<eos> It just makes things worse.<eos> And people always say they need one for protection.<eos> - They don't.
- Hey.<eos> - Uh, I'm working.<eos> I'll... I'll... I'll walk with you.<eos> I'm, uh, Kyle Diaz.<eos> Hi, Kyle.<eos> I feel like I know you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You said you couldn't wait to see me.<eos> I said a lot of things.<eos> - She did.
I, uh... I...<eos> And when she found out, she called.<eos> She told me.<eos> And I said...<eos> I said...<eos> "Just forget about him.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Just get on a chopper and come to me."<eos> I told my sister to get on that helicopter.<eos> I did it.
I am.<eos> Oh. I'm confused.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Um, Louise, do you remember your son at all?<eos> Donnie?<eos> Son?<eos> Son? I...<eos> I don't... I don't have any children.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, a-actually, you do.
We have to go.<eos> I'm going.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Love has boundaries.<eos> We know this.<eos> I tried my best.<eos> Please know that if I could've done more...<eos> I know.<eos> I do.
Love has boundaries.<eos> We know this.<eos> I tried my best.<eos> Please know that if I could've done more...<eos> I know.<eos> I do.<eos> She's stable.<eos> Yeah, uh, Robbins is closing.<eos> Your baby girl has a very strong mother.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Hello.<eos> My name is Lucifer Morningstar and I... love drugs.<eos> Love them! Mmm!<eos> Yummy, yummy, yummy.<eos> Can't get enough.<eos> And... I've got lots of money... mmm, that I love spending on drugs.<eos> Not even picky.<eos> I'll do any of them.<eos> Mix them together sometimes.<eos> You ever done a he-she?
He thinks he's a chicken."<eos> And the doc goes, "Well, why don't you turn him in?" The guy goes,<eos> "You know, I would, but I need the eggs."<eos> That's not very funny.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, I don't know what your deal is, but you make me a better detective.<eos> And you've always got my back.<eos> What more could I ask for?<eos> And you need the eggs.<eos> Damn right I do.
Yeah.<eos> Look, I don't know what your deal is, but you make me a better detective.<eos> And you've always got my back.<eos> What more could I ask for?<eos> And you need the eggs.<eos> Damn right I do.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> We don't have an appointment.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
I've been blaming everybody else for the situation I'm in.<eos> I chose to do nothing when my mother was cast out.<eos> To never ask her why she did what she did.<eos> So that's on me.<eos> That's good, Lucifer.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Well, I've assumed a lot about my mother, including the fact that she wants revenge for what I did to her.<eos> - And now she doesn't?
You clearly think your judgement supercedes mine, so why should I use my brain for ridiculous things like thinking when you're gonna do it for me anyway.<eos> I put a plane in the air.<eos> You did my job for me.<eos> You overruled me.<eos> You called my play.<eos> You were making mistakes.<eos> You were off the rails.<eos> When that happens, I have the right to make...<eos> No, no.<eos> You do not.
We all have our ways of coping.<eos> But, if you need to talk...<eos> - go ahead.<eos> - Not if you're uncomfortable, or...<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's probably healthier not to ignore it.<eos> So, um...<eos> Do you think it's starting up again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- I want to do it.<eos> - Okay<eos> I swear<eos> Look, I've spent my entire life watching this man line his pockets, so he could fly his mistresses around the world.<eos> I swore I would never be that person.<eos> Okay, so are we good?<eos> So, we're good, then?<eos> You don't need a subpoena for that.<eos> To pull all those clients' accounts?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Oh, I, uh...<eos> I mean, that sounds really dangerous.<eos> These are legit business folks I'm talkin' about, not just street thugs.<eos> - No, of course.<eos> - Hey, look, bro.<eos> We in Miami.<eos> Them dudes sittin' up in them Ivory Towers on Brickell?<eos> Ain't much difference between them and the dudes I know.<eos> I like it.<eos> You do?
How can you if you're not willing to take risks?<eos> I need to know what you do and do not want...<eos> I don't want this.<eos> Well, I need you to want this.<eos> I've been with many submissives, and they never know what they really want until they experience it.<eos> Hey, it's not all about you.<eos> It's about me and what I need for this relationship to work.<eos> I need to know that you are willing to do anything for me.<eos> I need to have that level of confidence in you.<eos> You don't already?
We don't want your stupid machine.<eos> - We came for your scrips.<eos> - Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You're a freedom fighter now.<eos> I'm just some fool engineer trying to solve the world's energy crisis.<eos> And all this time I thought you were just a self-serving thief.<eos> I don't even know who you are anymore.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> You don't.
You all right?<eos> Just déjà vu.<eos> All right, change of plans?<eos> This is it.<eos> What about the target?<eos> Is he here?<eos> We gotta disable that before we take him down.<eos> Why?<eos> How well do you know that Cuz guy?<eos> I don't.
Charlie, thank you.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> -My pleasure.<eos> "Got a guy who owes me."<eos> Fuck that. He is a guy.<eos> -He said he was in packaging.<eos> - The only thing that man packages is cocaine and body parts.<eos> Just be careful.<eos> You have Amanda Tims today?<eos> - I did.
Christy.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> How do I know it's really you?<eos> Who else would it be?<eos> Someone the government wants me to think is you.<eos> Oh, come on. Why would they do that?<eos> Because they know I know what they know.<eos> Now go away, or I'll set my dog on you.<eos> - We don't have a dog.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I get it.<eos> Sometimes the best place to be alone is in a crowd.<eos> Stay as long as you want.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Go.<eos> -Hey.<eos> -Hey.<eos> - So, do you still have that Adderall?<eos> - Oh, the Adderall.<eos> Uh, yeah, I do. At home, yeah.
Okay, let's get that thumb up there a little higher, okay, buddy?<eos> Dr. Alaimo.<eos> Dr. Alaimo?<eos> What happened?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You told Senator Healy we were crazy, but yesterday you thought an infestation made sense.<eos> Yes, but that was yesterday.<eos> It's not today.<eos> What changed?<eos> She did.
Can you please just be honest?<eos> Honest about what?<eos> About everything!<eos> About anything.<eos> I...<eos> I'm not doing good here, man.<eos> Everything's a frigging joke to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You want honesty?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Seems to be ours.<eos> - Good day, Ma'am!<eos> - What is this?<eos> - It is not for you.<eos> - A good man married my daughter.<eos> Hold on...<eos> This is a humanitarian assistance effort only...<eos> We're full... Quiet!<eos> I said I'm going to deliver "this" assistance.<eos> So, do it!
- Hey, turn it off.<eos> - Get something to eat.<eos> What'd Jey have to say?<eos> He's still in Tampa.<eos> He didn't pick up his phone.<eos> Came to get you.<eos> How long he been there?<eos> A few hours.<eos> Ain't been talking much though.<eos> What they do, big man?
Try some.<eos> You good?<eos> See now, Mo.<eos> You done made my breakfast all cold.<eos> I need something to heat this up with.<eos> Now I'd like to go back and finish the rest of it before it all get cold, too.<eos> So I'll make this quick now.<eos> Who shot Joelle?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
We met earlier today.<eos> You came in for a pitch.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, look, I'm sorry to call so late, can I buy you lunch tomorrow?<eos> I thought you guys passed.<eos> This is not Valencia talking.<eos> This is just me.<eos> I would like to buy you lunch.<eos> - Big man.<eos> What it do.

I am the master of the splits.<eos> Or at least I used to be.<eos> How did this happen? How did I get here?<eos> JC, I used your shower and now I'm all sticky.<eos> It's coconut water.<eos> Your shower uses coconut water?<eos> All of the plumbing uses coconut water.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course not.<eos> You never do.
I completely understand if you don't want to take love advice from an arm wrestling champion, but why don't you just say "hi" or "I miss you"?<eos> "Hi, I miss you"?<eos> No "in my pants"?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I'll give it a shot.<eos> Hey everyb...<eos> Damn it.<eos> Do you need a hand there, Sophie?<eos> No, I got it!<eos> You really don't.
I know you're angry about what happened, but this is... it's not for me.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Why did you just leave?<eos> I...<eos> I'm not... I'm not good at this.<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Do I strike you as the kind of woman who needs protecting?<eos> Yes.<eos> So you have a past.<eos> So does everybody.
Referring to evidence you'd uncovered of our existence.<eos> We would like to know what you found.<eos> Nothing certain.<eos> Until now.<eos> A bluff.<eos> - Nicely played.<eos> - It wasn't just a bluff.<eos> The more I studied my company's doings, the more there were things that could only be explained by your existence.<eos> Still, I had to know for sure.<eos> Now I do.
Still thinking about your meeting with Jim?<eos> No.<eos> There's nothing left to say.<eos> It's all in the past now.<eos> It's been less than a year.<eos> I think there's plenty to say.<eos> After all you went through with him, I just need to know that nothing's left unsaid.<eos> Well, you should speak to him yourself, then.<eos> - I did.<eos> - You did?
Get off me! Let go!<eos> Mr. Gordon!<eos> It really doesn't hurt?<eos> No.<eos> Whatever they did to me at Indian Hill, I don't feel pain.<eos> So why'd they make a Bruce Wayne look-alike anyhow?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't even know I looked like him until a few days ago.<eos> I went to his house thinking he might have some answers about who I am.<eos> He didn't.
They really want me as mayor.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can't be bought, but I can be stolen with one glance.<eos> I'm worthless to one, but priceless to two.<eos> Love.<eos> Cobblepot!<eos> Cobblepot!<eos> They love me.<eos> If you would've bought the election, you would've never known.<eos> But now you do.
Hey.<eos> So sweet.<eos> There he is, the man of the hour.<eos> I have a surprise for you, Butch.<eos> Not in the mood.<eos> What's in the box?<eos> Open it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - I already got one.<eos> - Oh, of course you do.
- No. Been hiding behind self-righteous lone wolf nonsense because you're afraid.<eos> Why is that?<eos> The badge holds expectations.<eos> People want a hero.<eos> You know what makes a hero, son?<eos> A man who values protecting others above protecting himself.<eos> A man who knows his limits but isn't afraid to fail. A man who knows when to ask for help when he needs it.<eos> Now... I-I wasn't always that man, but damn, that didn't stop me from trying.<eos> - I don't know how to be that man.<eos> - Well, sure you do.
Best to end things now.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't deserve him.<eos> Glad we agree.<eos> Bye.<eos> But I'm not gonna let him go.<eos> He loves me.<eos> And I love him.<eos> Do you know how rare that is, Mr. Mayor?<eos> Of course you do.
Lead detective for a high-profile murder, and you don't collect statements from everyone present?<eos> Me.<eos> Well, let's do it now.<eos> And for the record, I waive my right to counsel.<eos> - Captain...<eos> - Ask your questions, Gordon.<eos> Did you see Symon at the party?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Did you talk to him?<eos> - No, I did not.
For exposing him as the leader of the Red Hood gang.<eos> That makes perfect sense.<eos> I swear to you, Ed, we will find him and make him pay for what he has done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I knew I could count on you.<eos> I feel like this office is cursed.<eos> You think Barnes'll be all right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> You didn't.
You will feel my wrath.<eos> The wrath of Savitar!<eos> Did it work?<eos> That was so scary.<eos> I mean, that was... was it not truly frightening, what the voice and the prophesies and the... it was...<eos> I mean, that a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?<eos> I'm gonna have a mint tea and a coffee and a lay down.<eos> Do you think the things that he said about one of us betraying him and one of us dying could really be true?<eos> I mean, if it really was future Barry that pissed him off and locked him up somewhere, then maybe he knows what happens to future us.<eos> He doesn't.
Or is it time to switch it up?<eos> Be a lawyer maybe.<eos> Astronaut.<eos> I understand.<eos> You're upset that I told you I was a therapist.<eos> Maybe you are one, 'cause your intuition's uncanny.<eos> Linda, listen. I did what I had to do, all right?<eos> Now, you wouldn't understand this, but I was dealing with matters of great importance.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you did.
Or the balls, in this case?<eos> That stupid video was my breaking point.<eos> Everyone saw it. Everyone laughed at me!<eos> No one's laughing now, Tommy.<eos> So after everything that happened, what, you-you wanted to make him feel your pain?<eos> He deserved what happened to him.<eos> Yeah, but you're not answering the question.<eos> Did you kill Nick?<eos> I understand punishment all too well, Tommy, and Nick deserved to be punished.<eos> He did, didn't he?
But you got to see this... a-a naked man thinks he can jump on the back of a rhino.<eos> You'll never guess what he lands on.<eos> Actually, you probably will.<eos> What?<eos> You've seen it already?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Trying to catch our killer.<eos> Duh.<eos> - I thought you didn't care whether this sicko was brought to justice.<eos> Oh, I don't.
But existing in this punishment allows me to be closer to my family.<eos> Understand?<eos> Of course not.<eos> You're all alone.<eos> Oh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I...<eos> I like to rock it old school when I'm working.<eos> - Know-what-I'm-sayin'?<eos> - I do.
It looked like they had recently had a party there.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> I'm thinking it was a rave, so...<eos> Any way you could make some phone calls to help me out?<eos> You know, you seem to have your finger on the pulse.<eos> Not the appendage I'd hoped to be pulsing by now.<eos> I know that hood.<eos> There's a great tiki bar across the street from that building.<eos> I know the bartender.<eos> Course you do.
It was, right?<eos> What were you planning to do, Chloe?<eos> Crash the christening?<eos> I don't know, Dan!<eos> I was angry.<eos> The guy killed my father.<eos> He had the nerve to smile at me.<eos> Do you have any idea what that feels like?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Owns the bathhouse.<eos> Connects criminals but keeps his own hands clean.<eos> No one has ever been able to get to him.<eos> Yet.<eos> Detective Dan and I won't rest until we get to the bottom of this, I promise you.<eos> Wow.<eos> Look who bought a ticket to the gun show!<eos> Divorce becomes you, Detective.<eos> I do not sound like that.<eos> Of course we do.
They deserve this, and so do we.<eos> So, the other day, I'm walking down the street and I'm multitasking, which is a physical impossibility, by the way.<eos> I'm texting and I'm walking, and I step in it. Big, runny dog turd.<eos> And from what my wife tells me, you've stepped in it with one of these assholes, and that is a profession full of turds.<eos> There's no denying it.<eos> - L-Linda told me that you were in the business.<eos> -I'm intuitive.<eos> People tell me that my intuitions sometimes help.<eos> And sometimes my intuitions are not all that helpful.<eos> I don't do hocus-pocus, no past lives, no messages from Grandma.
In the cabin, opposite.<eos> They now about Noémie.<eos> They re coming for you.<eos> What?<eos> I'll go and have a look.<eos> What did you expect, Sarah?<eos> That I'd fly away with you?<eos> That we'd leave together?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, you don't.
Nothing.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Did Laurent have a fight with you or your husband?<eos> I told you.<eos> He said I was a pisspot and I slapped him.<eos> Had you been drinking?<eos> You think I'm a bad mother, don't you?<eos> Do you have kids?<eos> Do you know what it's like?<eos> No, I don't.
Laura Lee, she's been sick.<eos> I'm sorry to hear. I'm sure they miss her down at the schoolhouse.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you know, if it was up to me- But it's not up to you, Hank, and I understand that.<eos> Well, anyway...<eos> Jensen's gonna give you 'till August and... well, if you're not caught up by then he's gonna put a lien on the ranch.<eos> I tried to get him to give you more time, but...<eos> It's alright.<eos> You know how he is.<eos> I do, I do.
It was-it had a snake eating it's own tail.<eos> Can you imagine that?<eos> But she loved it, you know?<eos> She loved that kind of stuff.<eos> She was a fiery redhead.<eos> Yeah, she was beautiful.<eos> She had this hair all the way down her back.<eos> It was like a crimson sunset on Christmas Eve.<eos> But after I got this right here, she said I changed.<eos> She did.
And your relationship with Niska, Astrid?<eos> What we were to each other is... hard to say.<eos> But there was something there.<eos> That, I know.<eos> And what did you think when you first saw her?<eos> I thought that was the saddest-looking girl I've ever seen.<eos> And the most beautiful.<eos> And later, when she just left you?<eos> It felt... like a stone in my stomach.<eos> It still does.
May I come in?<eos> - Can I say no?<eos> - Your dad didn't give you the crash course before he left, huh?<eos> Uh, without a warrant, I have to be invited into your home.<eos> Like a vampire.<eos> Yeah. just like that.<eos> Except vampires don't get warrants.<eos> I do.<eos> - So, do you have one?<eos> - No, I don't.
- Okay.<eos> - Thanks so much for having me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Heard so much about you from Ron.<eos> Really? Good.<eos> Good.<eos> I brought you guys some wine.<eos> I know he doesn't drink.<eos> I didn't know...<eos> - No, he doesn't, but I do.
I don't know!<eos> What am I supposed to think?<eos> No... I don't know!<eos> Not that!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You don't... you... do you really... okay.<eos> I'm sorry. Do you really think I would do something like that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Honestly, I don't know.<eos> No, I didn't before.
Do I stink?<eos> Give me that.<eos> God, I can't stop sweating.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Izzy?<eos> Someone to see you.<eos> Isabelle.<eos> Did you get the stuff I sent you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yes, I did.
I know you will.<eos> That's what she said.<eos> No, that's not gonna do it.<eos> That's what she said.<eos> You just said the same thing.<eos> Now that's what she said.<eos> That's... What accent is that?<eos> - It's Italian.<eos> - Oh, really? - That's what she said!<eos> - Nope, that didn't
- Good.<eos> How're you?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - Good.<eos> You gonna invite me in?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I can't afford it.<eos> Come on, you really think I'm here for money?<eos> We do, yes.
Sheriff, would you like to stay for dinner?<eos> Yes.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Whoops! [Laughter] So, new to town, huh?<eos> Yes. I've acquired a taste for Old Town. [Laughs]<eos> So you might stick around?<eos> Whoops! I spilled gravy on me. [Laughs] Mmm!<eos> Something spoil your appetite? Hardly.<eos> Mama always said it's rude to chew with your mouth open. Well, I'd love to chew the fat with her some time. I already said "chew."<eos> Chew did?
Look, Audrey has just been destroyed...<eos> Audrey's been destroyed?<eos> Noah, our friends were being killed, and she didn't say anything to anyone, including you!<eos> Emma...<eos> - No.<eos> - No, look, I just want...<eos> Let her be.<eos> - Emma, I didn't know it was Piper!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Yes, you did!
Eddie Hayes, 24.<eos> He had an insulin pump implant.<eos> I matched him to the serial number.<eos> He was a clerk at the Crescent Palms Motel.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> - What?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> - You don't seem fine.<eos> You said you needed my help on this case.<eos> And I do.
Noah's his next target.<eos> Hey there, stranger.<eos> Miss me?<eos> I was starting to think we'd never get any alone time.<eos> No need for the silent treatment.<eos> Everything worked out perfect.<eos> They all showed up, just like you wanted.<eos> I guess I'll just have to find somewhere else to put my lips.<eos> They're not labeled. How do we know which breaker controls that giant room?<eos> We don't.
You brought Piper here!<eos> And why? What did I do to you?<eos> I was pissed, okay?<eos> I was pissed!<eos> You had your new friends and you abandoned me.<eos> - You wanted nothing to do with them!<eos> - ‭Whatever!<eos> No, not whatever!<eos> Why did you hate me?<eos> What did I do to you?
He's a real dog with a bone on this thing.<eos> - Oh, you seem really sure of yourself.<eos> - I am.<eos> And you know, for a long time I wasn't.<eos> And then this... weight was suddenly lifted off of me.<eos> What kind of weight exactly?<eos> Like someone poured cement in a bunch of bowling balls and then strapped those bowling balls onto a big fat circus man and then he climbed this ladder...<eos> - And then stood on your shoulders?<eos> - You get it.<eos> I do!
What I'm saying is it can do it all.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> Really? FTP?<eos> That's interesting?<eos> I'd like to get back to an important point... simplicity.<eos> And this kind of elegance allows for versatility, it allows for universality...<eos> Yes, a universal language, like I said.<eos> And the best part is, the online catalogue viewer, the transfer protocol, the Web server software, all of it is free.<eos> I have a problem with open source.<eos> - You do?

I have an idea.<eos> _<eos> Hey.<eos> Got your text.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Um, I think I've been sending some confusing messages.<eos> Punching me in the throat, abruptly running away from me.<eos> I think you've been pretty clear.<eos> No, because those actions might send the message that I don't like you and that I don't want to see you...<eos> And I do.
It's Laurel.<eos> Good. How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> I was wondering if we could meet up for drinks tonight.<eos> I'm okay, Laurel, you don't have to worry about me.<eos> I'm not angry at you.<eos> No, no, it's not that.<eos> It's, um, I have a scoop.<eos> - For Roll Call.<eos> - You do?
Okay.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> Why can't we do that?<eos> Because you were yelling at me to go faster while you ate chocolate and salami.<eos> I just need some time to think.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Oh, um... what did you need when you came by the office?<eos> I need your list of gerrymander districts.<eos> We have a bug.<eos> You do?
How could it be unknown?<eos> There are some other oddities here.<eos> It moves.<eos> Even after you cut it up.<eos> Do you have the bug here?<eos> Yes.<eos> We need your help.<eos> We don't know what we're dealing with here.<eos> And we don't have the equipment.<eos> The CDC does.
Uh, a constituent gave it to me.<eos> I thought it was funny.<eos> But then, uh, then I realized who put it out.<eos> It's our very own Centers for Disease Control.<eos> The real one; the one we're discussing right now.<eos> They put out a comic book about how to repel a zombie attack.<eos> This was merely a way to get people who usually don't care about disease to read about it.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.<eos> I thought I had five minutes.<eos> You do.
It was a he.<eos> So, this was close quarters then?<eos> Yeah, he's on top of me.<eos> Struggling, I mean...<eos> I couldn't reach my rifle so I had to stick him.<eos> Stick it. With my knife.<eos> And how did that... feel?<eos> - What, like...?<eos> - Emotionally.<eos> I didn't.
I'm fine, thanks, May.<eos> Look at him, just furious.<eos> Josh, stop it.<eos> No, he's always been a little bit jealous of his older brother.<eos> I'm not jealous. What's so incredible about Singapore?<eos> He'll be making a lot of money.<eos> Just raking it in, drinking cognac and playing golf, and being on various boats.<eos> What?<eos> I just want to hear you say that you're happy for your brother.<eos> - I did.
I'm talking fine like shine, girl.<eos> I'm gonna go to the bathroom, okay?<eos> Wait, wait, you're gonna take your jacket to the bathroom?<eos> She's... it's a girl thing.<eos> Hey, pretty girl.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Van, I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to hang out with my girl tonight, and I messed up.<eos> I did, okay?
Okay, CJ is not that bad.<eos> Seriously, I mean, yeah, he's like... he's like a lawyer or something.<eos> I think.<eos> I'm more valuable than that shit.<eos> You know what?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Look what I got you.<eos> I got this just for you.<eos> I know you want it.<eos> Yes, you do.
_<eos> _<eos> Mom, I need a dress from the 1940s.<eos> What?<eos> Now?<eos> Now you ask?<eos> Yeah, Mom.<eos> Jesus, Mom.<eos> I told you about this, like, weeks ago.<eos> No, you didn't.
He is a terrorist that is why there is no ransom call yet.<eos> Who would dare make a ransom call to the Home Minister?<eos> - Who is dealing with the opposition?<eos> - Mr. Nimbalkar. Mr. Jogi... you can make an issue out of this saying...<eos> He couldn't protect his son, how will he protect the country.<eos> But we are all vulnerable in a crisis.<eos> Right now we are very disturbed and sensitive.<eos> So avoid raising this issue.<eos> Else you know how low we could stoop...<eos> You do, don't you?
- Okay, I'll walk you to it.<eos> - No, no.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Okay.<eos> My apartment is just around the block anyway, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> Well... good night.<eos> You want to come by for a night cap?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You can have it back.<eos> And this... is for my cousin, Gustavo.<eos> [whispers] Coward.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Don't worry. It's going to heal well. [in English] I'll go back to Bogotá with the body until the funeral.<eos> They call his wife?<eos> Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.<eos> This ain't on you, Javi. It's on Escobar.<eos> And one way or another, he pays.<eos> We all do. Right?
Let's do it.<eos> Thank you, everybody!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> And welcome to the first ever Grand Tour.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
What...<eos> Hello.<eos> Can... Can I have those?<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wow. Your car is messy.<eos> You got kids.<eos> I can tell that.<eos> Yeah, I sure do.
What are you doing, Samantha?<eos> - Get out.<eos> - No way, Mom.<eos> Mom, you can't just leave us here.<eos> There's a bus stop right there.<eos> Get on the bus.<eos> Take it home.<eos> Mom, don't be a drama queen.<eos> That bus doesn't even go to our house.<eos> No, it doesn't.
- Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> So nice to meet you.<eos> I'm John.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Sam.<eos> This is Sunny, my friend.<eos> Uh, did you get a chance to look at the photos?<eos> Ahem. Yeah, we did.
♪ There's a bright golden ♪<eos> I love singing.<eos> I get to sing in my church.<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. You like church?<eos> Yeah, you're supposed to love church.<eos> Also, the singing is good, and I'm getting really good at it.<eos> Mom, Morgan says that her church is really great.<eos> Did you know that Mormons are really into music?<eos> No, honey, I didn't.
Also, the singing is good, and I'm getting really good at it.<eos> Mom, Morgan says that her church is really great.<eos> Did you know that Mormons are really into music?<eos> No, honey, I didn't.<eos> Did you know that Mormons are really into hating gay people?<eos> - Mom, don't!<eos> - What?<eos> - Well...<eos> - Be nice.<eos> Kind of they do.
Really?<eos> It's a mutual thing, I don't care about him, he doesn't care about me.<eos> But wait.<eos> Do you...?<eos> Do you have a condom?<eos> No.<eos> We totally used condoms.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, you didn't, Sam.<eos> Yes, we did.
Lena Luthor wasn't behind the explosion.<eos> She was the target.<eos> Should be a smooth flight, Ms. Luthor.<eos> I hate flying.<eos> I know statistically, it's the safest way to travel, but still...<eos> What the hell?<eos> I thought you two might show up.<eos> You spoil all the fun.<eos> You know, if you were expecting us to show up, you really should've brought something a little more powerful.<eos> I did.
Welcome, my friend.<eos> Please, would you like a drink?<eos> Give me the glass.<eos> You like this girl?<eos> This is a good girl, huh?<eos> - Karina.<eos> - Where's Daewon?<eos> Daewon?<eos> I don't know who this is.<eos> Vadik, you do.
- No! No!<eos> - Listen!<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> - That's not what this... shut up!<eos> Let me know when there's no one making threats to me or my entire family.<eos> We can talk about business.<eos> Let me know when you grow a sack of nuts.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Listen, I believed in GenCoin, Izzy.<eos> - I still do, but not like this.
I left $20,000 in the mailbox.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> For Jacob. Are you serious?<eos> Why would you leave that much money in a mailbox, Letty?<eos> My God.<eos> You're such a bitch.<eos> It was very generous of you.<eos> Jacob has a new wardrobe and $19,000 in a college fund.<eos> He has a college fund?<eos> Yeah, he does now.
Come here.<eos> Do you have your phone with you?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Smile.<eos> There.<eos> Now you have that picture and my number.<eos> So, if you ever need anything...<eos> Do you have my dad's number?<eos> No, I don't.
He raped us and took all our money.<eos> Why us?<eos> I don't even understand.<eos> I mean, we're not a known entity.<eos> It's not like we're holding billions.<eos> Someone had to know.<eos> Someone who'd been following the money.<eos> You said it was safe.<eos> - That's not what I said.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Uh... we just got hacked and someone... this a hacker guy...<eos> I mean, he took all of it.<eos> "All of it." That's what's up?<eos> Uh-huh. GenCoin.<eos> My money.<eos> That Blush dude money.<eos> All of that money?<eos> That money you was gonna give me yesterday when you and homegirl fired me...<eos> - Well, we didn't fire you, but yeah.<eos> - Yes, you did, Nick.
All in.<eos> What you worth?<eos> Man, nothing.<eos> I'm in debt.<eos> I've been paying off a student loan for 10 years.<eos> - Shit!<eos> - I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.
What you worth?<eos> Man, nothing.<eos> I'm in debt.<eos> I've been paying off a student loan for 10 years.<eos> - Shit!<eos> - I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.<eos> His girl does.
He knows.<eos> - He doesn't "know" know.<eos> He... - He most definitely knows.<eos> And when he comes with his lawyers, that's game over.<eos> He wanted to see proof of funds!<eos> Okay, we just have her fake up some documents.<eos> Oh, my god! Stop!<eos> That's making it worse.<eos> - You got a better idea, Nick?<eos> - No, I don't.
- Sir. Sir.<eos> Halt.<eos> Scanning.<eos> You may proceed.<eos> Same as the Cheyenne ship.<eos> Unlike the vessel recovered in '03, this ship doesn't appear to be designed for man flight.<eos> Looks like it's trying to establish a link.<eos> Let's see what it's trying to say.<eos> I don't even know if any of these alien bastards is out here.<eos> We don't.
Could have stayed at home and finished "Amadeus" and had a better time, man.<eos> - Well, that's true.<eos> - Look, man.<eos> Marcus Miles over there getting all the cream, man, hogging all the hos.<eos> Fuck him too!<eos> Marcus Miles is pretty cool, man.<eos> You know he got that invisible car?<eos> What?<eos> Nigga, no he don't.<eos> He do.
Work fast!<eos> Hi, Aniello!<eos> Hi, I'm glad to see you.<eos> You're lookin' good.<eos> What's up?<eos> I like fruit and especially what your boy's got.<eos> Nothin' better!<eos> I'll tell you straight, I don't like this situation.<eos> My boy, as you call him, has to stay out of this.<eos> He does this, nothin' else.
- Yeah, well, good luck with that.<eos> You're right.<eos> Fuck Him.<eos> Fuck God.<eos> Fu... I don't want to do this anymore.<eos> -What, this?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Why not?<eos> Because, uh... because you don't want to have the same arguments about theology that we had once a month when we were married?<eos> -I don't...
Stay right where you are!<eos> Let me guess, someone called in an anonymous tip?<eos> Shut up.<eos> When do they invent deodorant?<eos> Please, just call the airfield and tell them that the "Hindenburg" is in danger!<eos> Please!<eos> Piece-of-crap, old lock.<eos> Can you open it?<eos> Oh, yeah. Easy with a hairpin, which I'm guessing you don't have.<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah. What's up?<eos> Yeah...<eos> - We love your show. - Huh?<eos> Do you want to dance?<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> But, um, you know, you go ahead.<eos> It's my birthday today.<eos> 36 today.<eos> - You don't look 36.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- We love your show. - Huh?<eos> Do you want to dance?<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> But, um, you know, you go ahead.<eos> It's my birthday today.<eos> 36 today.<eos> - You don't look 36.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> Hey, Big Three, do you three know how much I love your mother?<eos> - any idea? - Yeah, we do.
No, it's okay.<eos> No, no.<eos> Nobody be alarmed.<eos> Nobody be alarmed, this isn't a real baby.<eos> This baby can't feel a thing, because everything's fake!<eos> God forbid we have real emotion in this show.<eos> What do we got here?<eos> We got a real suitcase.<eos> Finally, we got something real.<eos> Oh, no, we don't!
- Yeah. - Hmm.<eos> You want to know how many, uh, calories are in a sausage?<eos> Is... but is it even legal?<eos> No.<eos> Not in this country.<eos> Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No, I...<eos> No, I-I do.
Not in this country.<eos> Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No, I...<eos> No, I-I do.<eos> It's just been a long time since this has even been an option.<eos> Hey.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Um, you don't.
Small dick.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna name you.<eos> From now on you'll be known as small dick.<eos> Smalls for short.<eos> Come on, smalls, why you goin' so slow?<eos> Don't you want this?<eos> You want it? Yeah?<eos> Come on, smalls.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Because we're undercover.<eos> Because it's a secret.<eos> Raimy... I know what kind of father I've been, okay?<eos> And I know what I've lost.<eos> I lost your mother... and I lost you.<eos> I know what I've lost, okay?<eos> I do, I... and I know what I got to do to get it back.<eos> Dad, please don't go.<eos> Raimy, I know you mean well.<eos> I do.
- Dad, here. - Whoa!<eos> All right, give 'em up, cell phones.<eos> What, are you serious?<eos> Yeah, it's my trip.<eos> You can cry if you want to. Okay, no.<eos> Just take it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Hey, what are you doing... Hold on.<eos> But I need my laptop.<eos> No, you don't.
She... is.<eos> She... fractured her pelvis.<eos> Kara's here?<eos> Wait. Kara was driving the car?<eos> She's pregnant?<eos> You have got to be kidding me!<eos> She had the nerve to show up!<eos> - Kara did this to us?<eos> ! - She said it was an accident.<eos> - Of course she did.
What the fuck?<eos> Abuela.<eos> She's so beautiful.<eos> Yes, you are, Mama.<eos> You are so beautiful, Francis.<eos> So how's Derek?<eos> He's doing well.<eos> All right, Mama.<eos> He said he wants to meet Franny.<eos> He does?
Love is not supposed to be cute.<eos> Love is raw and destructive.<eos> Love is you almost stabbing me in the heart with an ice-pick when we were having an argument.<eos> That's the kind of passion you can't fake.<eos> Well, Neil and I don't need passion.<eos> Come on, Franny, let's go give Daddy a bath before Mommy has to go to work.<eos> Bye, Franny.<eos> Bye, Deb.<eos> Our thrills don't have to end.<eos> You goddamn right they don't.
Yes, you catch on fast.<eos> Smart guy.<eos> Thank you so much for saying that.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> And she also created a condition of sexual harassment in your workplace.<eos> Well, we both screwed her, but I wanted to stop way before my wife did.<eos> Pressured for sex.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Yeah, so we got any shot about getting our bar back?<eos> We do.
- I like to be left alone.<eos> - So do I.<eos> Stop watching me.<eos> Well?<eos> Good guess.<eos> Listen everywhere you go.<eos> You'll hear it.<eos> And what does that mean?<eos> - They like the bass line.<eos> - The bugs do?
She hasn't been in the office the last four hours.<eos> And someone is trying to break the encryption on her phone.<eos> I'll tell Cornish we can get started with her.<eos> You're seeming pretty anxious about this.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I want to stop the terrorists.<eos> Why else?<eos> Hello?<eos> You know who this is, Agent.<eos> I do.
'Cause that's exactly where I want to punch him.<eos> Hey, Chale.<eos> Uh, Mr. Gable, please.<eos> There's no need for a scene.<eos> Obviously, we are both alpha males.<eos> I'm texting Kendra.<eos> She shouldn't be waiting tables, putting all of her dreams on hold for mine.<eos> A-And now it's causing problems with you.<eos> I love her so much, but... I have to break up with her.<eos> Oh. Well, you do your thing.
So I have to be absent for a few minutes, okay?<eos> But I leave you in the capable hands of my associate,<eos> Hai Lai Rutledge.<eos> Okay, she's very good.<eos> Come, come, Hai Lai. Yes.<eos> She's very good.<eos> She plays with the blood.<eos> - She knows what I want.<eos> Ciao.<eos> - I do?
Wait, wait, wait whoa, whoa!<eos> Whoa, no, no!<eos> Whoa, hang on...<eos> So it's come to this, Pollux?<eos> Sacrilege.<eos> Treason.<eos> Death.<eos> No one has to die here today, Rainey.<eos> Do you know who this is?<eos> Do you?
You guys really have your hands full in Missing Persons.<eos> Maybe Major Crimes should take a crack at it, give you two guys a break.<eos> We're here about the bodies.<eos> Bodies?<eos> What bodies?<eos> Men with tattoos, heavy tattoos all over.<eos> You didn't--<eos> You didn't transfer the bodies from the Patrick Spring case? - No.<eos> What would we want with them? - We do not want bodies.<eos> No, we don't.
Is that the woman?<eos> I don't know her.<eos> Right, but that is a woman.<eos> What are you even talking about?<eos> Give me the dog, or I'll kill her!<eos> Give us the her or we'll throw the dog off the bridge!<eos> - What? - I'm bluffing, but if he shoots her, throw the dog off the bridge.<eos> - Why did you attack us?<eos> - We didn't! - How do you know who we are?<eos> - We don't.
Shark.<eos> How did you...<eos> The kitten and the shark.<eos> Of course, so that means...<eos> Of course?<eos> What "of course"?<eos> Dog.<eos> Girl.<eos> - Ah. This makes sense.<eos> - It does?
How did you...<eos> The kitten and the shark.<eos> Of course, so that means...<eos> Of course?<eos> What "of course"?<eos> Dog.<eos> Girl.<eos> - Ah. This makes sense.<eos> - It does?<eos> Well, it did until right now.
- No.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> You're gonna walk away, and if you look at me, I'm gonna put a bullet through your head.<eos> - Do you understand me? - Mm-hmm.<eos> What?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - All right.<eos> - Ah. - What up, Jey?<eos> - Big Ronnie, what it do?
Call them.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Does Dad have Parkinson's?<eos> Did Dad say something?<eos> No.<eos> I was looking through his medicine cabinet.<eos> Levodopa?<eos> Yes.<eos> He does.
The People's Council of Cultural Affairs.<eos> Is that what you meant, Doctor?<eos> That's the council that supplied the zoo animals?<eos> Yes.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Good.<eos> I think you're ready.<eos> Senator.<eos> Do you have a moment?<eos> I do.
It's such an old-fashioned concept, who takes over who.<eos> You're probably just as likely to overtake us.<eos> What?<eos> You said, you're likely to overtake us.<eos> So?<eos> Us.<eos> You're a bug, and you're more bug than human.<eos> You got me drinking.<eos> I don't know what I'm saying.<eos> Yes, you do.
Okay, let's go here.<eos> And the next year, she was bumped up to two Michelin stars, and that made her the first female chef in America to earn that honor.<eos> The day we found out we got the two stars, I think they called her at her house.<eos> And then I'm the first person she calls.<eos> She just said, like, "We got it."<eos> You know, "Thank you so much.<eos> This is yours as much as mine and it's the whole team."<eos> So I cried that day, for sure.<eos> Let's go here.<eos> All right, how we doing on the dessert?
No...<eos> No, Kieran...<eos> Tell me that I'm wrong.<eos> Kieran?<eos> You're not wrong.<eos> Emma!<eos> You know... he probably really liked you.<eos> You're a monster.<eos> And the best part is... you just told me you love me.<eos> I did.
- The best!<eos> And me, too!<eos> Great crowd, babe.<eos> What are...<eos> What is this?<eos> Oh, Olivia's president of our fan club.<eos> She's also doing half the band.<eos> Do you even know what that means?<eos> Uh, let's just say I couldn't toddle right for a week.<eos> Okay, you don't.
Hey, let's keep this party rolling.<eos> I'll go get us another badly-scratched plastic pitcher of soda.<eos> Ugh, finally, he's doing something useful.<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Nothing. It's just, you write all the songs, you've got a better voice, you've got the sweet bod...<eos> Oh, my God, babe.<eos> Plus, you've got all the cool catchphrases like "damn you all" or "what the dude" or whatever.<eos> Uh, it-it's "deuce." But, uh, but yeah, you're-you're right, it...<eos> I-I do.
She got stuck at work.<eos> We're short a hostess, so...<eos> Well, it's good to see you.<eos> It's good to see you too.<eos> Okay, do you want to go to the playground today?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, okay, let's go.<eos> Hello, Joanie.<eos> Mama, does she have to come?<eos> Yes, baby, she does.
She had another appointment.<eos> Well, how did I do today?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, did she say anything to you about, you know, my behavior?<eos> I saw you two talking, so...<eos> We were talking about her kids.<eos> We don't talk about you.<eos> That would be unethical. I just, you know, thought maybe she said something about...<eos> Right.<eos> She didn't.
I want more cake.<eos> Okay, you can have another piece of cake after you ride the pony.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Look, I can take her for cake.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> I can.<eos> Joanie, nobody else can go before you go.<eos> Look, she doesn't want to ride.<eos> Of course she does.
Just stop, will you, please?<eos> Don't be a monster.<eos> She is my daughter, okay?<eos> I know I fucked up, and I've apologized a thousand times.<eos> And I am so grateful to you for everything you did while I was gone, but she is my child.<eos> And she needs me.<eos> And you can everything, okay?<eos> You can have the restaurant, Cole, the house, but please, please, don't take her away from me.<eos> I don't deserve that.<eos> Nobody does.
And you can everything, okay?<eos> You can have the restaurant, Cole, the house, but please, please, don't take her away from me.<eos> I don't deserve that.<eos> Nobody does.<eos> Hi. What are you doing here?<eos> Do you really think that I would stab Noah Solloway? No!<eos> What?<eos> I... no, of course not.<eos> Then why did you send the police to me?<eos> - I didn't.
What if he's Dracula?<eos> Oh, wait. It's daytime.<eos> Wrong count. Monte Cristo?<eos> Sorry. Not on the menu.<eos> Never a fan of the eggy bread.<eos> No, Granny.<eos> It's a place.<eos> - And its Count has quite the reputation. - Oh.<eos> Why would he want to meet with us?<eos> He doesn't.
I can't take that lightly, but...<eos> I am glad to still be here.<eos> I mean, there's horror in the taking of life.<eos> Also an elation in being the one that walks away.<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> Welcome to the neighborhood.<eos> I got you a cheeseburger.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Get yourself one, too?<eos> Yes, I did.
Do you really think I went out yesterday?<eos> At night, in the rain? Into the forest?<eos> What for?<eos> Kill children then sneak back to the abbey?<eos> You know it doesn't make sense.<eos> Wait...<eos> What did he say?<eos> I used to come here with my father.<eos> You'd have loved your grandpa.<eos> Everyone did.
Tell me one fact that you know about me.<eos> I mean, we spent the whole day together.<eos> You must remember something.<eos> Is it racist if I say Africa?<eos> Yes, and Africa is not a country.<eos> I am from Senegal.<eos> Do I have any siblings?<eos> Where did I go to college?<eos> Trick question.<eos> You didn't.
Cheers.<eos> God.<eos> What if I moved to Montauk?<eos> Why?<eos> To be with you.<eos> No.<eos> I, I want a divorce, Noah.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You don't.
What if I moved to Montauk?<eos> Why?<eos> To be with you.<eos> No.<eos> I, I want a divorce, Noah.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You don't.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I do.
You haven't become her, Alison.<eos> Haven't I?<eos> Fires, oceans, and babies.<eos> Those are the things I could watch forever.<eos> Fires, oceans, babies.<eos> I don't know how you made it through Gabriel's death.<eos> I thought about it a lot when I was away, and just... 29 years old, and you lose your child.<eos> No real parents, no one to take care of you.<eos> I-I don't know how you survived.<eos> I didn't, really.
Yes.<eos> But you're a human.<eos> Not completely, remember.<eos> I have always felt like one of you.<eos> I've always wondered, where is it?<eos> This embedded part?<eos> Here.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Do you love me, Leo?<eos> Yes, I do.
The seating is perfect.<eos> - Really?<eos> Are you happy?<eos> - Yes. Now close your eyes.<eos> Close them!<eos> Open.<eos> They're so beautiful, Dad.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I should be thanking you, you know what this wedding means to me.<eos> I do.
- Yes.<eos> - Yes, and who would blame him?<eos> - I would.<eos> Why avenge genocide with genocide?<eos> Why avenge?<eos> Trust me...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The Cabinet is empty.<eos> I knew it would be.<eos> Every Rhodian does.
I-I think maybe... it's best if you found your own place.<eos> I-I didn't realize...<eos> The last thing I want is to upset you.<eos> You should go to work.<eos> And... don't worry about me.<eos> I'll find a place tonight.<eos> I mean, it doesn't... ahem... have to be tonight.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I understand.<eos> Do you?
It's fine.<eos> I understand.<eos> Do you?<eos> Don't leave tonight, 'cause I got dinner...<eos> David.<eos> It is okay.<eos> Just, um... you should go to work.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Do you mind?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
But if you're in my way...<eos> Actually, you're in my way.<eos> If you wouldn't mind pressing "down."<eos> Do you think that this is funny?<eos> No, I think it's pathetic.<eos> I've interviewed Carly Shannon...<eos> "Interviewed"?<eos> On official business, yes, during which time the bruises on her arms and her forehead were pretty goddamned unmistakable.<eos> Okay, accidents happen, man.<eos> Not anymore they don't.
What the hell did she say to you to make you consider not having a medic on our team?<eos> She didn't have to. I know what she's going through.<eos> Do you?<eos> What happened to "the mission comes first"?<eos> She just needs a little time. I'm sure she'll make the right decision.<eos> You shouldn't have given her the choice.<eos> It's a little more complicated than that, Carly.<eos> Look around.<eos> She has a life in the 21st.<eos> We all do.
You can't get a trophy for looting, if you didn't loot anything!<eos> You could give a trophy for "Most Improved Looting."<eos> I mean, if somebody never looted before.<eos> Like, for example, me. So...<eos> That's a great trophy.<eos> You don't need a trophy for everything you do.<eos> [mimicking a child] "Oh, my feelings are hurt if I don't get a trophy."<eos> That's tough!<eos> Do you know how many people I had to pillage and raid and kill to get to be captain?<eos> Do you?
Look again, honey, they ain't empty.<eos> That was fantastic.<eos> Your performance got a bit inappropriate in the middle, but otherwise, fantastic.<eos> Don't listen to her, the middle was the best part.<eos> Did I get eaten by a shark earlier?<eos> Thanks for being there for me, you guys.<eos> Making that booty clap just wouldn't mean as much without you there to share it.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't get the kind of family you deserve.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
Brodney.<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> Huh? King Julien, we don't know anything about him.<eos> Except that he...<eos> Not aga- - Oh... [whispers] Smells.<eos> It doesn't matter, Clover.<eos> My parents have gifted me a brother.<eos> And if there's one thing I know above all others, it's this.<eos> I love gifts!<eos> I do!
That's it?<eos> Where's the rest?<eos> "Eaten or married."<eos> Sorry, Your Majesty.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Have you found an undesirable yet?<eos> [sighs] I thought having a brother would finally make us a real family.<eos> Instead, I've lost everything.<eos> Enjoy the throne.<eos> -I sure did.
Well, if this is true, maybe we should get rid of--<eos> The silly notion that fewer scorpions mean less danger.<eos> Ha, ha, ha! Did you know kingdoms with the least scorpions are the most dangerous?<eos> Is that true?<eos> I sure said it like it is.<eos> Can we just use our brains here for a minute?<eos> Stop treading' on us, Maurice!<eos> [talking incoherently] He's still kinda swollen on account of getting stung in the face 160 times, but he agrees!<eos> Don't you all love your families and want to keep 'em safe from robbers and killers?<eos> Even if he doesn't.
[Karen] Um, King Julien?<eos> Go away, Karen. [cries]<eos> I don't want to bother you, but I thought you could use a friend.<eos> [scoffs] Didn't you hear?<eos> I don't have any friends.<eos> Besides, you were probably paid to be my friend just like the rest of them.<eos> Oh, that's not true.<eos> Nobody had to pay me to be your friend.<eos> I always thought you were the coolest, sweetest, most handsome lemur in our school.<eos> I still do.
And I just, you know, thought that the tape might help or whatever.<eos> Crimson, but why?<eos> You and I, you know, we have our problems.<eos> Um... But, she was my grandmother, too.<eos> I wanted you to win.<eos> Wait up. You two have the same grandmother?<eos> Clover, did you know about this?<eos> Yes, King Julien.<eos> She's my sister. You did good, Clo-Clo.<eos> You did good.
He wanted someone guiltier than him to end his suffering.<eos> And you stopped him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Because I'm not innocent.<eos> Not in my heart.<eos> For a Rhodian, a wish is the same as an action.<eos> That's messed up.<eos> I know.<eos> I think we have some things to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do.
I rewrote the piece myself.<eos> What?<eos> You can't just rewrite my piece.<eos> Actually, Snapper, I can.<eos> 'Cause I'm your boss.<eos> Doesn't feel good to have somebody encroach on your job, does it?<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> I have complete control of editorial content.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
I can't continue seeing Jack.<eos> Look, I'll be happy to e-mail you the names of some therapists whose areas of expertise are more in line with his areas of...<eos> Good luck to you.<eos> My son just got fired by his therapist.<eos> It's quite a turnout.<eos> Excellent.<eos> We may need Gunther to bring in more seating.<eos> I fired Gunther.<eos> What?<eos> You did?
Yeah.<eos> You were tending the bar that night.<eos> You stayed late to clean up.<eos> Yeah, that's what we always do after the...<eos> Then you saw Scott coming down from the stairwell leading to the roof.<eos> He was disheveled, out of breath, sweaty.<eos> You were about to ask him if he needed anything, but he was in such a hurry, he left without saying a word.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't see anything like that.<eos> Yes, you did.
I can't be there for you all the time, okay?<eos> And when I'm not... Do you understand?<eos> Good.<eos> Why is it when bad things happen, we always bring food?<eos> Back then, after they found Jacob, all my friends and neighbors came with casseroles and pies.<eos> You're gonna be all right.<eos> We're survivors.<eos> You still have a son.<eos> And he needs you.<eos> Like sons always do.
You and that...<eos> So what about the stuff?<eos> What are they gonna do with it?<eos> I didn't ask.<eos> The less we know, the better.<eos> We shouldn't have done that, Frank.<eos> We should not have helped them.<eos> Come on.<eos> Tell me it didn't feel good.<eos> It didn't.
Unless you're gonna charge me, neither do you.<eos> Or should I give my lawyer a call?<eos> It's the same one that got Garrett out of jail, so...<eos> So, why were you making all these calls to Jennifer?<eos> Can you close the blinds?<eos> Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> I, um... I think Jennifer Windham was murdered because of me.<eos> No, Alison, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> It does.
Okay.<eos> Right.<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Untie me.<eos> Deceased is Gunther Holzmann, 53.<eos> Hung himself with an electrical cord.<eos> Left a note, "I'm sorry"<eos> And you think he's the Silver Bells Killer?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
We've got to tell the police.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Tessa, the bells are gone.<eos> I had Gunther get rid of them.<eos> - Well, you didn't know.<eos> - I didn't know what?<eos> That there was a Silver Bells Killer on the loose?<eos> Of course I did, the whole world did.
Don't you have a family?<eos> I mean, didn't they miss you?<eos> Yeah, I have a family.<eos> But I don't know whether...<eos> My little sister might've missed me.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I missed her.<eos> And that's why you came back?<eos> I came back because my father was dying.<eos> And then he did.
Well, here's your Moondog weather update.<eos> Scattered showers of lunar debris throughout today, followed by a heavy downpour of death, with flaming chunks the size of Nantucket by tomorrow.<eos> The long-range forecast? There isn't one.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - You don't want to hear it.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Not really.<eos> - Well, more than I do.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm gonna go look.<eos> - How?<eos> - There's a car in the driveway.<eos> - You don't have the keys.<eos> - Then I'll hotwire it.<eos> You know how to do that?<eos> Fortunately, yes, I do.
- Let's go.<eos> Oh, hey, Dana.<eos> It's me, Dad.<eos> I'm not Dana.<eos> I'm Sherry.<eos> Yes, you are. Dana.<eos> We named you Dana.<eos> Where's your sister?<eos> I don't have a sister.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'll die before I do any real harm, remember?<eos> Remember that?<eos> !<eos> A punishment from his people who were destroyed?<eos> A punishment given to only my people who were also destroyed.<eos> That's billions of people gone, murdered, and you... you, all this time to take your revenge and you said nothing?<eos> ! The choice isn't yours.<eos> God!<eos> If I didn't have this thing in my head...<eos> - Yeah, but you do.
Yeah, but that's what war is, though, isn't it?<eos> You're always waiting to die.<eos> You have no idea what war is.<eos> Sorry, what was that, April?<eos> We sit here and talk about war like we have the first clue.<eos> The mindset of the soldier.<eos> How can anyone here even guess?<eos> Well, imagination is an act of empathy.<eos> Of course we don't know what it was actually like.<eos> No, you don't.
They insulted me.<eos> You're not going to their fair.<eos> But she asked me.<eos> Look, can you just have my back without an argument, just once?<eos> In which fight?<eos> Who can keep track?<eos> All right, both of you, calm down.<eos> I will not say "BibbidiâBobbidiâBoo."<eos> - I don't think that adds anything to the conversation!<eos> - Yes, it does.
- Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Jianyu!<eos> Michael, Janet said you wanted to speak to me.<eos> Well, actually, she was just drooling a lot and saying "hello" over and over again, but she did point at you.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, you don't.
Holy mama.<eos> I can't believe you sold the t-shirts.<eos> Does it help if they basically sold themselves?<eos> I think you know it does not.<eos> What did you do with the money?<eos> Gah, I was hoping you wouldn't ask me that.<eos> Thanks, babe.<eos> Next question.<eos> Eleanor. Given what you know about the people who've been brought here, the lives they've led, do you think you belong in the Good Place?<eos> No, I don't.
Killer tits.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Listen, man, maybe it was Micki dying or Phil Tessla, but it kind of focused Ava and me on what's really important in life, and how short it is, and maybe we're supposed to be together, man.<eos> What?<eos> That's the lie you're telling yourself.<eos> Listen, dude, in the end, she went for the money.<eos> I get it, it's cool. Whatever.<eos> That's a nasty thing to say.<eos> You really think she would've moved in with you if you didn't own that farmland in Jersey?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yes.<eos> You were being a very naughty little horsey.<eos> Okay, that's good for me.<eos> I'm gonna go throw up now.<eos> Okay, you do that.<eos> Close the door on your way out.<eos> Yep.<eos> You have a key?<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Like it always did with your dad.
Well, you should.<eos> I'm your Grandpa.<eos> Haven't seen you in almost forever.<eos> Grandpa left town when grandma went to heaven.<eos> I missed you.<eos> Gimme a hug.<eos> Well, um, I know you'll are busy and I'll get out of your way.<eos> You mean, you're not staying for Christmas?<eos> Your grandfather never really liked the holidays.<eos> - I did.
Come on. Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> OK, if a dog is gonna be in my house, there need to be rules.<eos> Really?<eos> What rules?<eos> Lots of rules, Father.<eos> Lots of them.<eos> Not now!<eos> Rand, I didn't know you were coming.<eos> Yes, you did.
Where is Nose?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> - He got out of the motor-home.<eos> - How?<eos> I guess he knows how to work the handle.<eos> I think it's too cold for Nose to stay out there for very long.<eos> - Let's all go find him.<eos> - I'm sure he'll show up.<eos> Now how do you know that?<eos> What if he doesn't?
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Wait, wait a minute. Wait.<eos> Wait a minute, guys.<eos> - Explain.<eos> Explain. - Okay.<eos> - We...<eos> - You're the one who made me that appointment with that first guy who turned out not to even be a doctor.<eos> - How do I even know I have cancer at all?<eos> - Just trust us.<eos> You do.
Blood can't test itself.<eos> - That... That's what I mean.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just now coming to me.<eos> I've never had my blood even tested.<eos> I just went to a person who said, "You undeniably have cancer."<eos> I don't even know if I actually have cancer!<eos> - You do.
I appreciate what you did for me, but I don't want to be your personal full-time reclamation project.<eos> Do you know what your problem is?<eos> Well, off the top of my head, I got no home and no legs.<eos> You have too much pride.<eos> Come to my place.<eos> I may not get back on a board ever again, but I'm gonna do something with my life.<eos> I just got to do this part on my own.<eos> That's just it.<eos> You don't have to do this on your own.<eos> Yes, I do.
You've gone behind my back, talking to my enemies.<eos> This is what happens!<eos> The story of America's most notorious gangster... Starts on the streets of Brooklyn.<eos> Take this downtown.<eos> This is a raid!<eos> Nobody move!<eos> Against the wall! All right, turn around, hands on the wall!<eos> Your gambling hall on 4th ave, the cops are raiding it!<eos> I thought we paid them off?<eos> We did.
How are you this good at it already?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> So now what? I'm just stuck doing this baby shit for the rest of my life?<eos> What if there are other things I'm meant to be and I never find out?<eos> Like a phlebologist or a dinosaur?<eos> Once my ex and I split, I figured that was it.<eos> I was never gonna be a dad.<eos> Then I meet this cute Asian chick at the Kubrick exhibit at LACMA and suddenly she's knocked up and I get this second chance at 42.<eos> So you believe in second chances?<eos> I didn't.
Well, you're clearly not enjoying cucking.<eos> Which is what we're doing.<eos> And it's ruining it for me.<eos> I am doing the hard work to be a better partner. And tell you what I need.<eos> And if you can't handle it...<eos> I just don't know, Paul.<eos> I just don't know.<eos> So... This cucking is something many women fantasize about?<eos> All of them.<eos> They all do.
Yeah, this doesn't really help us, Ashley.<eos> You see, the key to oppo research is to hit on that one infraction.<eos> So, what is our one thing?<eos> Laurel slept with her communist poly sci professor and had an abortion.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> Unfortunately,<eos> - it's not true.<eos> - Wha...<eos> How do we know that?<eos> Because we do.
Does he think I have something to contribute?<eos> I would've said no, but he keeps... throwing your name out there.<eos> So... we need to give him something.<eos> Such as?<eos> Well, he's a good man.<eos> And he wants the truth, n-not just a-a leak.<eos> And what's the truth?<eos> - Mr. Boch.<eos> - My guess is you have some information for me.<eos> - I do.
Just the way your voice sounds... It doesn't sound like a funny thing.<eos> No, it's funny.<eos> The newest oppo research has you sleeping with someone I know is wrong.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You want to know who?<eos> Sure, if you want to tell me.<eos> Michael Moore.<eos> You know, Michael Moore, the liberal.<eos> I do.
Alive, dead, we're just specks of dust.<eos> We blow away in the wind.<eos> But it makes no difference.<eos> We make no difference.<eos> Dead or alive is all the same.<eos> That is the beauty, Joe.<eos> No.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Please tell me it matters.<eos> Of course it does, Joe.
I wrote it myself;<eos> they can't take it away from her any more than they can take my deal away from me.<eos> But you need to tell me exactly what Cahill said to you when he told you to turn on Sutter.<eos> Nothing.<eos> He never said anything to me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm telling you I've never spoken to Sean Cahill in my life.<eos> All right, I'm here.<eos> But I gave you seven days to find that witness, and then you went behind my back, so you better have a good reason why you're in here asking to reopen this case.<eos> We do, Your Honor.
If it was up to me, I'd let you starve.<eos> Let me guess: you're here to tell me how much time they're tacking onto my sentence.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter how much.<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna get to him, and I'm gonna get to you.<eos> Sorry, Frank, but you're not getting anything tacked onto your sentence.<eos> Your parting gift is going back to the maximum security hellhole you came from.<eos> No way.<eos> You don't have the power to make that happen.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But my friend at the SEC sure does.
Fake Eleanor, are you giving up?<eos> Yeah, of course she is.<eos> She knows this place isn't for her.<eos> Let's go, dingdong.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, I'm not leaving.<eos> Oh, come on, sweetheart, we've been through this.<eos> You know you don't belong here.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't...
[Rangel] 97% of those people who were locked up have plea bargain.<eos> And that is one of the worst violations of human rights that you can imagine in the United States.<eos> We have, in this country, people pleading guilty to crimes they didn't commit, just because the thought of going to jail for what the mandatory minimums are is so excruciating.<eos> [reporter] Kalief Browder decided, "I'm not gonna take the plea."<eos> So, you had to choose between being in prison for up to 15 years and going home right then by admitting you did a crime you didn't do.<eos> I felt like I was done wrong.<eos> I felt like something needed to be done.<eos> I felt like something needs to be said.<eos> If I just cop out and say that I did it, nothing's gonna be done about it.<eos> I didn't do it.
There's no third deal.<eos> Harvey, please.<eos> I've betrayed this man enough.<eos> I need you to convince Cahill that one person makes a case, but two people is a slam dunk.<eos> Okay, Mike.<eos> I'll make it happen.<eos> Louis?<eos> Do you have a second?<eos> Actually, I don't, Donna, because I'm going on the most important date of my life tonight, and I have no idea where I'm taking her.<eos> Yes, you do.
- I don't understand.<eos> You said that she had to agree to be there for me.<eos> She agreed to sign the papers.<eos> But she's not gonna come.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> Leonard, don't take your eye off the ball.<eos> This was about buying us time.<eos> Take my eye off the ball?<eos> Do you even give a shit about me?<eos> Of course we do.
I need you to get him out of solitary.<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> I can't do that That's bullshit.<eos> You switched into my cell the first night and ever since, you've been bragging about everything that you can do in here, so how about you stop telling me that you can't do it, and just tell me whether or not you will.<eos> All right, Mikey.<eos> I'll get your ticket to freedom out of solitary for you.<eos> But if you get out of here and I don't, you should know, I can get to you just as easily out there as I can in here.<eos> And when I say "get to you," you got to remember what I did to make Harvey put me away in the first place.<eos> Do you want to talk about what happened at the prison?<eos> No, Rachel, I don't.
Jessica, I told you I loved you once.<eos> And when I said that, I meant that one of the things that I love about you is your ability to push emotion aside and knock the shit out of people.<eos> So you think I'm cold, but you love that about me?<eos> I'm saying that's one of the things that I love about you.<eos> The other thing is that in your heart, you're not cold at all.<eos> What do you say after dinner, you take me home?<eos> I say... I think that we should take it slow this time.<eos> Listen, I know you hate me right now, but right this second, we are on the same side.<eos> I know.<eos> - You do?
Welcome to Danbury, Sean.<eos> You know you're taking a big risk that someone's gonna recognize me and figure out that you're up to something.<eos> Well, I'd be taking an even bigger risk if I didn't hand this to you personally.<eos> You're not gonna weasel out of my deal again.<eos> What is this?<eos> That is an iron clad agreement between your office and Jill Miller.<eos> You're representing Jill Miller now?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Does she know that you're not a lawyer?<eos> She does.
Come on.<eos> All right, yeah.<eos> I don't think this was a random attack.<eos> These are CRs filed against Platt.<eos> The top two are lawsuits she's racked up.<eos> We think she knows her assailant.<eos> A guy came in the district last week, made threats.<eos> I want to know why, and I want to know who, and fast.<eos> Sergeant, you know we got those new cameras installed downstairs?<eos> We do?
Come on, I'm buying.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> I mean, he's not gonna breathe free air again, so we can just move on.<eos> Move on?<eos> He hasn't been arraigned.<eos> There is gonna be a trial.<eos> You're gonna testify.<eos> I... we can move on from the worst part.<eos> I do.
I think we should let the students decide what they want to hear.<eos> That's right, students of Monster High.<eos> You now have a choice in who you want to lead this school's student council.<eos> You can vote Frankie and Drac, the monsters who hide.<eos> Or Moanica D'Kay, the monster with pride!<eos> See you on the ballot, ghouls.<eos> Moanica can't win the election.<eos> Right?<eos> She won't.<eos> But what if she does?
You can change.<eos> You can fix this.<eos> Whatever it is, I will help you.<eos> No, but that's the thing.<eos> You just said it. I have to throw the punch.<eos> That's why I came out here alone.<eos> You can't do it for me this time.<eos> Do you know how it feels when you know all your happiness is a lie?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I'm sorry. - Wha... the, uh...<eos> - Could he...<eos> Could Dr. Kushel have stopped himself from writing prescriptions?<eos> Uh, in my opinion, no.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Frontotemporal dementia robbed him of that capacity.<eos> He could no more force himself to do the right thing than a man with a severed spinal column could force himself to walk.<eos> And does Dr. Kushel know what's wrong with him?<eos> - In my view, he...<eos> - Fucking right I do.
Either way, we're after a fentanyl ring.<eos> Waypoints for Blind River, Ontario,<eos> Mackinaw City, Michigan, and Chicago.<eos> We ran a quantitative and qualitative analysis on the sample from the lake.<eos> It's not coming back as fentanyl.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Chemically, fentanyl's a pharmaceutical designed to treat cancer patients... potent enough that a molecule on the head of a pin is deadly, but if even a molecule's altered, then technically, it's not a controlled substance.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Do you know how many OD's we have off this stuff down at Med?<eos> I do.
- Thank you.<eos> - Uh, Tariq Bolad...<eos> Two gunshot wounds, center mass, wallet and keys still on him but no cell phone.<eos> Who called it in?<eos> Shot spotter picked up possible gunfire.<eos> Dispatch put it over the zone.<eos> We were first on the scene.<eos> Is ASA Stone around?<eos> The Ariel Kincaid murder. You remember it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
A lot of people's lives have been upended in the last couple of decades.<eos> Yes, I suppose they have.<eos> You spent the last four years under Mr. Peterson in counterintelligence tech.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> His disloyalty was a shock to all of us.<eos> I'm sure it was.<eos> I'm just trying to piece together Mr. Peterson's movements over the past few days.<eos> His assistant said you came to see him yesterday.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Turn that off!<eos> What're you doing?<eos> I got orders to execute his NDA.<eos> Scrub his memory.<eos> Whose orders?<eos> Gavros left.<eos> Green Zone league not gonna happen.<eos> So all that time, money, and effort, just pissed right down the drain.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know what happened out there.<eos> Oh, I do.
Coming from you?<eos> So, come on, who was that heartbreaker, hmm?<eos> He used to go out with Boo.<eos> Then he slept with someone else, and then she...<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know, OK.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I've never really said how sorry I was.<eos> You should get the trainers.<eos> She'll say I don't know her.<eos> You don't.
Love Harry.<eos> Exciting news about his new job.<eos> Yes, very exciting.<eos> I was so pleased that you'd found someone else so fast.<eos> I just can't stop conjuring an image of you sitting around that cafe, just all alone, feeling so terribly lonely.<eos> Just can't stop picturing it.<eos> I don't think you have to be alone to be lonely.<eos> Dad always taught me that.<eos> Did your father tell you that one of my pieces has gone missing?<eos> He did.
Well...<eos> You know it's all relative, I think.<eos> I mean, my husband you know... Maybe he would make it through this, section. If you were lucky.<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Can I... do you mind if I go out side?<eos> I have to make a phone call.<eos> Yeah, yeah of course.<eos> You know the way.<eos> Yes I do.
We don't really... we don't do the gray hound thing.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You're like the gray hound queen.<eos> Yeah they're just sitting around they're not practical.<eos> Chris pointed out and he's right that you know...<eos> We have lot of special needs.<eos> They take a lot of work, we are a small organization and then it's manageable.<eos> I guess I just...<eos> You love gray hounds, I mean.<eos> Yes I do.
You gotta send me some pics.<eos> - You're gonna come visit.<eos> - Absolutely, I will.<eos> As soon as I get those job scenarios squared away.<eos> - Oh, what, the Suh thing?<eos> - Suh's the least of my worries.<eos> Anderson clipped me last night.<eos> You got fired?<eos> I didn't tell you?<eos> No, you definitely didn't.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> We've searched the grounds, and there is no sign of Agnes anywhere.<eos> If she shows up again, we will get the police involved.<eos> I promise you.<eos> I don't want to stay here.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I really don't.
We'll get to it.<eos> - We'll get to it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Look, it's so not a big deal, but I got this thing in my office, it's a pashmina scarf, you know?<eos> It's been up there for a while.<eos> We could go up and get it.<eos> Thank you, Dad.<eos> But I really...<eos> - I gotta get cracking on this.<eos> - Of course you do.
- I'm sorry, I tried to stop him, but he was so desperate to get out of here.<eos> Did he say where he was going?<eos> Just said that he was going back where he belongs.<eos> He's gone.<eos> I never should have hesitated.<eos> I knew it wouldn't help and so did you.<eos> I figured we had safety in numbers.<eos> I know.<eos> But if we'd had an alternative plan to save his life, yeah, I would've held firm with you.<eos> But we didn't.
- No.<eos> His camera's all glitchy.<eos> The feed keeps cutting in and out.<eos> Going through the fire probably didn't help.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> We got something.<eos> Is this thing on?<eos> Anyone seeing this?<eos> We do.
No.<eos> But everyone else has refused to be room parent.<eos> Great, put me on that list.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> It would also be a shame if I don't teach your daughter to read.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I said that's a shame.<eos> No, you said something after that.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - Yes, you did...

Those are not the same kids I used to see when I came home at night.<eos> Those kids smelled good and were delightful.<eos> Well yeah, it took me all day to get 'em that way.<eos> You were just getting the greatest hits.<eos> Yeah. Now it's the deep cuts.<eos> The... the drum solos, the bass player sings a song.<eos> They didn't even clean up after themselves.<eos> It's like living with three tiny truckers.<eos> Look, honey, I understand you had a tough day, I do.<eos> I do.
I have a plaque from the county, which I said we should hang in the den, and you never did, and now nobody can find it.<eos> Okay, well, there's a big difference between building houses and raising kids.<eos> Not true. Not true at all.<eos> They both need a solid foundation.<eos> That's right, didn't see that coming, did you, huh?<eos> Look, all I know is I can take care of our kids.<eos> Didn't see that coming either, did you?<eos> Well, great.<eos> Do you have a plan to get the kids in line?<eos> Yes, I do.
I know it's not much, but the price is right.<eos> You just have to agree to keep the common areas clean, and do some small repairs for the residents.<eos> So, um, the landlord know about my record, right?<eos> That I'm on parole?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He does.
Hey, girl, what you been eating?<eos> Ice cream.<eos> You scream?<eos> I'm gonna scream if I got to carry you up these stairs.<eos> You're too heavy.<eos> Guess the thing I really need to say out loud to everyone is, well...<eos> I'm down three pounds in one week.<eos> Oh, guys, come on.<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> You don't...
"Simon watched the man exit the motel, "and they were alone again.<eos> "He, gazing at her, "she, staring at her own reflection.<eos> "Both of them were watching the same thing, the tears filling Kitty's eyes."<eos> Dude, keep going!<eos> I need to know what happens with Kitty and Simon and Bug.<eos> I'm so worried about Bug.<eos> Well, that's all I wrote.<eos> Well, go finish it.<eos> You know how it ends, right?<eos> I do now.
Gathered from the medication from the other patients.<eos> She must've been doing it for a while now.<eos> - The only reason someone would have amassed a pharmacy like that...<eos> - I know.<eos> The only person she'll see is you.<eos> I'm just forgetful, that's all.<eos> I keep picking up pills I think are mine, putting them in that cupboard there.<eos> I quite forgot about them until that lady knocked them out by mistake.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> Aye, we do.
Even song lyrics talk about problems...<eos> Sure, but Good always wins.<eos> Everyone's happy and huggy, love is pure, beautiful, and immaculate, and so on...<eos> How do you think people end up with love like this?<eos> It's a long, long road to this kind of love.<eos> - Sure, sure... But it's out there.<eos> - It is.<eos> - And it doesn't exist in the real world!<eos> - You're wrong. It exists.<eos> The fuck it does!
- Really?<eos> What else do you see in your crystal ball?<eos> You work hard.<eos> You're tough as nails.<eos> And your father would cut my balls off if he saw me talking to his little girl.<eos> I'm sure he wouldn't be the first to try.<eos> - See, you know me, too.<eos> - I don't.<eos> And you don't know me, either.<eos> Oh, but I do.
Do we have any quick thinkers in the room?<eos> Now is your moment to shine.<eos> The kill switch and its trigger, they're connected wirelessly.<eos> If we find the frequency, we can hack the Kusari and disarm it.<eos> Too dangerous.<eos> We don't know what kind of firewall it has.<eos> It could kill her as soon as we try to break in.<eos> Share your wisdom with us, then.<eos> How do you propose we disarm it?<eos> We don't.
Uh... yeah.<eos> Um, my dad was...<eos> He was a great man...<eos> I had tremendous respect for him.<eos> ...as a president, but, um, you know, to me, he was just...<eos> Dad.<eos> I mean, he had the hardest job in the world, you know, um, things coming at him from everyone and everywhere, but you know, still, he was always there for me.<eos> Um, and now...<eos> I have some very big shoes to fill.<eos> Yeah, we both do.
We're just talking.<eos> I gave you a compliment.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Walking around in a dress like that, like you don't want attention?<eos> look at that!<eos> I'm just being nice.<eos> Let go.<eos> You want it rough, all you got to do is ask.<eos> Come on, baby, you know you want it.<eos> you do. You do.
I suggest we raze it.<eos> I see.<eos> What's the population of Savannah, Erich?<eos> Roughly 84,000, sir.<eos> 84,000.<eos> Well, thank you, Gruppenführer.<eos> I will certainly take your suggestions into account.<eos> I will make the necessary preparations.<eos> Our empire does not possess such a device.<eos> No. We do not.
Want to be the first to peep my badass movie monster and epic CGI skills?<eos> It's just CG, computer graphics.<eos> What could the "I" possibly stand for?<eos> Incredible.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Watch this, watch this.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> That's not even remotely how this program is supposed to work.<eos> Oh, I like it when a woman takes charge.<eos> Yes, I do.
A man with him was murdered.<eos> Was they, uh... Was this guy a cop?<eos> No.<eos> He was a bouncer at some place that they were.<eos> A massage parlor in Oakland.<eos> I think maybe Raymond has an interest in it.<eos> I... Do you think that, or do you know that?<eos> Well, I hear things.<eos> I don't know anything for sure when it comes to him.<eos> No one does.
I know you can't.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> Does the president expect the governor to just bow down?<eos> Carter, it's been seven days since Al-Sakar took credit for bombing the Capitol.<eos> When can the American people expect a response?<eos> Uh, the president is busy meeting with his advisers, and, um... working up a strategy.<eos> Can you be any more specific?<eos> Uh... not really.<eos> - But the president does have a strategy?<eos> - Of course he does.
I just think it's about time the good guys got some of our own.<eos> Alien guns are bad no matter who controls them.<eos> The Second Amendment gives us the right to bear arms.<eos> Even if those arms are ray guns.<eos> That's what Cadmus wants.<eos> They're the ones handing out these weapons,<eos> They want us to be afraid of each other.<eos> To not trust each other anymore.<eos> Well how do you know what Cadmus wants?<eos> I... I just do.
-Where do...<eos> Hey, you're really tall.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> Oh. Hi.<eos> What's the emergency, Mr. schott?<eos> Is she drunk?<eos> Mon-El took me to happy hour.<eos> -Of course he did.<eos> -He knows how to drink drinks.<eos> Of course he does.
Hey, Stan.<eos> What was the story gonna be?<eos> Help me out here, buddy.<eos> Some corrupt undercover cop, he goes off the reservation, he gets himself shot.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Not to start a brushfire here, but if Little Jay had taken you out, what difference would any story make to you?<eos> Two years.<eos> I put myself on the line for you for two years, and you can't tell me why... why I got shot?<eos> What makes you so sure I got answers?<eos> Somebody does.
I'm dipping.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Please, don't stop all your smooth moves on account of me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, the phone company came back.<eos> - Yeah, and?<eos> - We got to go.<eos> There's a pattern of calls from the Goff house to a pay phone in Washington Square.<eos> - Oh, we got him.<eos> - Yes, we do.
You know, I'm under the same kind pressure, but, Frank, it's been two years of<eos> "Daddy will be home for Christmas."<eos> He'll be here for your birthday when you're seven, or when you're eight.<eos> Maybe you just shouldn't make promises.<eos> No, I want her with me.<eos> I want her to stay here with me.<eos> You know what she said when she got home last night?<eos> "Everybody needs to stop lying to me.<eos> I'm not a baby anymore."<eos> Of course she did.
Same boring beige halls.<eos> Actually, I think that cockroach in the light is new.<eos> Nope, Ernie's been here longer than me.<eos> I'm excited that things are getting back to normal.<eos> No more corporate getting all up in our business.<eos> Oh, you know that the district manager's still here, right?<eos> Jeff?<eos> What is Jeff still doing he...<eos> You don't think he's trying to find a reasonon to fire me?<eos> - Do you? - No.
Land's sake!<eos> You two sure do fish a lot.<eos> We find it's a great way to relax from the pressures of being a millionaire playboy and his teenage ward.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse us, Aunt Harriet.<eos> Can you believe the lengths those two go to keep their little secret?<eos> - Secret, ma'am?<eos> - Why, Alfred!<eos> You really don't see it?<eos> No, I do not.
He won't take any pills that aren't chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.<eos> You know, when Leonard's feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.<eos> Does that help?<eos> Well, for a while.<eos> Then he comes back.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.<eos> You did already know, right?<eos> No one at the office did.
Belardo made the error of leaving these letters at the back of a drawer.<eos> - Have you read them all?<eos> - Only the pertinent passages.<eos> The steamy ones.<eos> The ones that prove that Belardo has had a woman for years.<eos> You should have read them all, and with care.<eos> In this last one, he states he'll never send these letters to that woman because he's married to God.<eos> Do you have any evidence that they were mailed?<eos> Any envelopes with canceled stamps?<eos> No, no, I don't.
So long, Ma.<eos> Your Holiness, don't you feel well? No, no.<eos> Just a passing discomfort.<eos> - Should I call the doctor?<eos> - No, no, it's nothing serious.<eos> It's over.<eos> Are you certain you don't want me to call the doctor?<eos> All better now.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> I... yes, I do.
I've counted.<eos> But all the world leaders from the summit are in Federal Hall.<eos> They don't want them. Why?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Sit down.<eos> All I know is, the hostages from Federal Hall are getting too much for the terrorists to handle, which is why they want to trade them all for Boyer.<eos> You can't let that happen, Raina.<eos> But that's almost 1,700 hostages.<eos> - You don't want them rescued?<eos> - Of course I do.
Well, you know I can't say no to booze.<eos> If I could, I'd still be in The Temptations.<eos> No, no, no, it's very little booze, okay?<eos> See, you drink it for the raw cacao.<eos> Yeah, it releases serotonin and boosts your energy and your mood.<eos> I'm pretty much a genius.<eos> And I'm pretty much gonna pass.<eos> You want to try a Cacao Storm?<eos> Huh, buddy?<eos> Yeah, you do.
I actually think you secretly like this.<eos> No, actually, no.<eos> This is my face when I don't like something.<eos> Hey, what happened at your interview with Pohl?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I got a call that it didn't go well.<eos> I think I'm out of contention.<eos> It was about the affairs, right?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> You don't?
Paragraph 1403, sub-paragraph 6, footnote 11: "A provision to purchase $108 million worth of glass."<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> And this is for the internment camps in the farm bill?<eos> Yes, apparently, they tried to hide it under the rubric of budgetary windows.<eos> But, epiphany, it's a real window.<eos> Do internment camps have many windows?<eos> No, the whole point is not to have windows.<eos> That list of sites for the camps, which one was closest, do you remember?<eos> Of course I do.
I take my job seriously, too.<eos> I would never pretend to do your job.<eos> Please extend me the same courtesy.<eos> Good seeing you.<eos> This is my job, Director.<eos> And this funding is in the farming bill.<eos> We're voting on this bill today.<eos> We have it under control.<eos> - So you knew about it?<eos> - We did.
With no heads-up.<eos> Kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.<eos> All right, so you just momentarily lost your mind and thought you were 20 again?<eos> What were you trying to prove?<eos> That I could do an Ironman.<eos> Better not affect your performance in the field today.<eos> I feel great.<eos> I don't want to hear a thing about, you know, your tight calves or your chafed nipples.<eos> Well, then you definitely don't want to hear about my rectus femoris.<eos> No, I do not.
Thank you.<eos> Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.<eos> No worries.<eos> You guys stink.<eos> Sorry I flipped out on you.<eos> I think it's just hormones.<eos> I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it's fine.<eos> So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don't we just decide on a theme for the nursery?<eos> Does it really need one?<eos> Of course it does.
And you thought this wasn't gonna be a great party.<eos> You know, I had no idea<eos> Caltech is exactly like my high school.<eos> Well, it's not exactly like it.<eos> We're all extremely smart.<eos> Wow... you popular girls are mean.<eos> I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?<eos> Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do.

- Roll.<eos> Roll the Rs.<eos> - Rowjohn?<eos> Rojon?<eos> Rrrrr.<eos> R-R-Rojohn.<eos> Rojohn.<eos> Look, every person on a crew has a role.<eos> I'm guessing yours is breaking things, moving heavy objects, maybe grunting from time to time?<eos> He does a lot of grunting.
Your choice.<eos> Marcus, come back here.<eos> A .380?<eos> - You the one that killed Haley?<eos> - Who?<eos> Put that gun down, Marcus!<eos> Look, I didn't want any of this, all right?<eos> They made me do it!<eos> I believe you.<eos> I do.
But whatever happens on Saturday, February 11th, 2012... Go home with Wyatt.<eos> Even if he's being an ass.<eos> Just let him take you home.<eos> And know that he loves you. More than you'll ever know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Worked in "Back to the Future II."<eos> Wyatt.<eos> I know what you're gonna say.<eos> No, you don't.
Eep, no.<eos> Put the boulder down.<eos> Yeah, honey, you've gotta fight it.<eos> Mom, Dad?<eos> Go!<eos> You're embarrassing me!<eos> [whimpering] No, no, I need help.<eos> Repressing The Crush made it stronger.<eos> [snarling] Which feels good!<eos> [whimpering] No, it does not.
Or do, but not like that.<eos> Get away from them.<eos> And away from me, too, I guess.<eos> [chuckles] [screams] Oh! That's how we gotta scream!<eos> But it's hideous.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Come on, guys. As hideous as you can.<eos> Mom, I'm sorry... for everything.<eos> I don't know what happened to me.<eos> Actually, I do.
Everyone else is here.<eos> Not everyone.<eos> Not you, and not... that guy over there.<eos> Darn sky bunnies!<eos> - I'm gonna eat ya!<eos> - Oh, wait, that's Gorp.<eos> [chuckles] Gorp, stop yelling at the sky and come party, you goof.<eos> That guy. Where was I?<eos> You know where you were.<eos> Fine. I do.
[laughing] That is so my dad.<eos> So, to get them off my back, we need new ideas to get you hunting faster, and that means it's time for another... idea fair!<eos> Hmm. Thought you'd cheer there.<eos> Anyway, as always, the team that presents the smartest idea at the fair takes home these awards.<eos> Whoa! Don't get your hopes up.<eos> You know Bulk and Sulk always win, 'cause their dad does their projects for them.<eos> Such a rip-off.<eos> Now, since Bulk and Sulk have won every fair we've had so far, I've decided to make a change by giving them their awards in advance.<eos> [chuckling] Come on up, boys.<eos> They did it!
I do that sometimes.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I just want to grab some clothes and shoes that I left here.<eos> Sure, yeah, okay.<eos> Hey, I'm curious.<eos> How do you know when it's time to buy a new pair of shoes?<eos> To be honest, shoes for me are whimsical.<eos> So, I heard what happened.<eos> Of course you did.
I want you to go back there.<eos> What?<eos> Return to New York today.<eos> It is no longer safe for you here.<eos> Please go.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> The rumors are true, then?<eos> I need to know if what my father is telling me is right.<eos> Did he ask you to leave?<eos> Yes, he did.
What is it?<eos> The op's been blown.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means trouble.<eos> We need to go to your suite.<eos> For what?<eos> Just being cautious.<eos> Hey, Mac.<eos> I thought you said this train was nonstop.<eos> I did. Why?
We'll have about two seconds to make it before we hit the tracks at 100 miles an hour.<eos> That sounds awesome!<eos> Let's do this!<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Now what?<eos> Now we, uh... We go back to Plan "A".<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said that Plan "A"<eos> could kill everybody on board the train.<eos> Yeah, I did.
She must be activating the bug software that's messing with the Penter server!<eos> Penter server?<eos> Something's messing with the election.<eos> Well, things just got a lot more complicated, because that woman is Sophia Vasquez...<eos> It's the president's chief of staff.<eos> All right, Happy, you're certain you stopped the footage at exactly 7:13?<eos> I know what seven, one and three look like.<eos> Okay, if the president's chief of staff downloaded that bug, and the president sent the FBI to get us to fix the server...<eos> How do we know Backside, Fart and Go-Smell-Me aren't in on this?<eos> We don't.
It's not a book for children, and it's not a book for morons.<eos> The book is published in 1970.<eos> You were equipping people with this knowledge to do what?<eos> I'm...<eos> Yeah, I don't think that...<eos> I don't think I hoped they would do anything with it, quite frankly.<eos> "This is a book for anarchists... "those who feel able to discipline themselves "on all the subjects, from drugs to weapons, to explosives."<eos> I don't think the book actually says,<eos> "This is what you should do with this information."<eos> In fact, it doesn't.
Oh, as in, like...<eos> I imagine you had some kind of visceral reaction?<eos> Yeah, I mean, you... you, um...<eos> You feel terrible. You, um, feel sick to your stomach and...<eos> Was your instinct to try to learn more?<eos> There was part of me that didn't want to know anything about it.<eos> Um, and there was part of me that was torn apart about it that did want to learn more.<eos> At this point, we're in the Internet age, you know, everyone Googles themself, and you have a book that you can search.<eos> At any point did you start to look at whether the book was connected to any other events?<eos> I did do a Google search of "The Anarchist Cookbook."
No secrets. Spa days and sisterhood.<eos> We were gonna run over this town together.<eos> And now what?<eos> He's riding on your handlebars and I'm just sitting in the sidecar?<eos> You need to calm down.<eos> What's this?<eos> Ask her. She wrote it.<eos> Wanted to rub my nose in it.<eos> I didn't write this. No.<eos> Someone with your handwriting did.
There it is.<eos> Get it.<eos> Snow:<eos> Follow me!<eos> - Snow! Aren't you a real Prince Charming.<eos> You... You saved me.<eos> I thought I'd lost you forever. May the love between you always be strong, true, and eternal.<eos> If you need anything, I will always find you.<eos> Do you promise?<eos> I do.
Thanks?<eos> Hold up.<eos> I present to you the mother of L.A. sporting events, and you're doing paperwork?<eos> Paperwork's not gonna do itself.<eos> You don't want to go.<eos> I never said that.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I thought this was our thing.<eos> I thought you liked football.<eos> I do!
This one's all nasty.<eos> How about you take one of the nicer-looking grapefruit?<eos> - Oh, I don't care how it looks.<eos> - Good.<eos> Well, then if you don't care what it looks like, you can just take one of these.<eos> - I want this one.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I want it, and I need it.<eos> - No, you don't need this one.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yes, yes, it's normal.<eos> It's just, I just thought I had, like, one or maybe two more years with her.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You know, it's weird.<eos> It's like, you bring home this cute little baby, and all they want is to be with you, like, every second of every day, and then they grow up, and you're proud, of course, but... but also sad and lonely.<eos> Yeah, no, babies are hilarious.<eos> I should probably get back out there.<eos> "I admit I stole the fruit like some Saudi Arabian street rat."<eos> - You want me to sign this?<eos> - Yes, I do.
You bring her back.<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> Yeah, we do, you twisted prick.<eos> I'll call you back with a where and when.<eos> In the meantime, don't do anything stupid.<eos> Nicole... or wait, you call her "Nicky," right?<eos> Yeah, Nicky won't like that.<eos> I think he went for it.<eos> He's gonna call back.<eos> 'Course he did.
- Oh, one thing.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When you meet her, you can talk about anything, except don't ask about the accident.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Got it. It's just it's her first day out.<eos> I... I don't want to upset her.<eos> Okay, I got it.<eos> Hey, you made it.<eos> I did.
Against the advice of police,<eos> Stella has decided not to press criminal charges.<eos> Which means that you won't be going to jail.<eos> I was never gonna hurt you.<eos> I was just upset, that's all...<eos> Yeah, we're looking forward, Grant, not back.<eos> My recommendation is that you voluntarily commit yourself to the Springfield facility and begin the process of getting well.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm...<eos> Look, I... I know... I know I need help getting clean.<eos> I do.
Yes, indeed.<eos> - What's the plan?<eos> - We're gonna show 'em our talent.<eos> That's what we're gonna do.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's showtime.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's showtime.<eos> Who wants to see what he's gonna do?<eos> - I do!
- What about him?<eos> - We had him first.<eos> We used rapport-based questioning.<eos> We got names, dates, resources, turned him over to the agency, where you waterboarded him 83 times and got nothing but gibberish.<eos> - That is one gentleman...<eos> - An unconfirmed...<eos> A black site is not an option.<eos> Deputy Director Atwood, you believe you can make progress?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I do.
Do you have any leads?<eos> Yes.<eos> What?<eos> Who?<eos> I'll be handling it on my own.<eos> I know you feel betrayed.<eos> Samar and Aram feel betrayed.<eos> Everyone feels betrayed.<eos> But... my daughter is missing, and if you have any idea how to find her, you've got to tell me.<eos> No, I don't.
Thank you for doing this, Samar.<eos> I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.<eos> Come on, Liz.<eos> We're not gonna do this now.<eos> She hates me.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> For now.<eos> She needs time.<eos> We all do.<eos> We all do?
What's this?<eos> It's a DNA report.<eos> Here they are.<eos> Hey, you did great work today.<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> You have the data file?<eos> I wish I could meet all the people who dreamed up what's on here.<eos> Every one of them killed for no other reason than the power of their imagination.<eos> You know who she is and you're gonna give her that?<eos> Yes, Agent Ressler, he does.
I can turn it off like a faucet.<eos> Just like a faucet.<eos> Carol?<eos> Tandy.<eos> Carol, what are you doing?<eos> Oh, Tandy, I'm so scared.<eos> What if Pat comes here and finds us?<eos> - He's not going to.<eos> - You don't know that for sure.<eos> Yes, I do, okay?
She was strung out, but she was trying to get clean and save her money.<eos> She had a daughter who lived with her mom in Ensenada.<eos> This is a pretty girl? I mean, what's she look like?<eos> Nice hair, light eyes, not short, but not too tall, great figure.<eos> Well, she sounds like a keeper.<eos> Yeah, no, she's beautiful, but she was also just...<eos> Some of the others, they don't like to go with me so much 'cause of my scars.<eos> But she didn't care about that at all.<eos> Last time I saw her, she called me to see if we could meet.<eos> And did you?
Shoes?<eos> Boxes?<eos> It's dark in there.<eos> Give me one second.<eos> I just wouldn't have pegged him for claustrophobia.<eos> Six months of solitary can do that to you.<eos> Solitary?<eos> How would you know that?<eos> León likes to talk.<eos> No, he doesn't.
He's dead.<eos> I feel pretty confident about that.<eos> What else do we know?<eos> We know who didn't kill him.<eos> And a million-dollar painting is missing.<eos> We find the painting, we find the killer.<eos> Checked everybody's houses.<eos> Nobody has it.<eos> Everyone insists Bruno has it.<eos> He didn't.
And that's not what I wanted.<eos> So I went to his house to say I was sorry.<eos> Anyone see you talk to him?<eos> Bruno wasn't there.<eos> Just that nasty old witch, Frimkes.<eos> She saw the bruise on my knuckles, figured I was the guy that beat up Bruno, and threatened to call the police.<eos> So I got the hell out of there.<eos> She saw that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did.
I mean, the Nissan GTR: Fabulous, fabulous car.<eos> Rubbish. It's undriveable.<eos> You know, it's a very good point, because a racing car on the road is a bit like trying to play tennis with a cricket bat.<eos> It's technically possible...<eos> Two totally different disciplines.<eos> The only trouble is, that looks so good, I do find myself going...<eos> You erm... You bought the last GT, didn't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for reminding me, Hammond.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Let's go say hi.<eos> To be continued.<eos> - Hey, Uncle Kevin.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good to see you, all right.<eos> - Got my keys?<eos> - Yup.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
How does it feel to be dying?<eos> It feels... like all these beautiful pieces of life are flying around me and... I'm trying to catch them.<eos> When my granddaughter falls asleep in my lap, I try to catch the feeling of her breathing against me.<eos> And when I make my son laugh, I try to catch the sound of him laughing.<eos> How it rolls up from his chest.<eos> But the pieces are moving faster now, and I can't catch them all.<eos> I can feel them slipping through my fingertips.<eos> And soon where there used to be my granddaughter breathing and my son laughing, there will be... nothing.<eos> I know it feels like you have all the time in the world.<eos> But you don't.
There's actually an ethnic slur for Norwegians.<eos> It's ice [bleep]ers.<eos> Hey, buddy, they canceled my showing, so I can drive you to work.<eos> That looks good. What is it?<eos> Lobster Thermidor from the country club.<eos> There's also cherries jubilee in the fridge.<eos> Look at us eating like rich people... in the '50s.<eos> Hey, Mom!<eos> Have a good day at work.<eos> Uh, I already did that.
Thanks.<eos> Chloe, your brother got in a fight.<eos> He's in the jail infirmary.<eos> God.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll drive you.<eos> All right.<eos> Levi.<eos> Over here, Levi.<eos> How you doing, SweetVicki?
You've got all your lady friends, and...<eos> Actually, I'm single now.<eos> What? !<eos> When did that happen?<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's by choice.<eos> Well, their choice, and it's not okay.<eos> Oh. Sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Report.<eos> Garcia Flynn stole the tape from the White House.<eos> We didn't have a chance to stop him.<eos> Nixon was on it.<eos> He sounded terrified about Rittenhouse, mentioned something about a document.<eos> Destroy the doc.<eos> How? I'm not...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have it.<eos> When you do.
Who is Rittenhouse?<eos> Please.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I might be mixed up with them too, and I'm scared.<eos> I am... I am really scared.<eos> You should be.<eos> They control all of us.<eos> Look.<eos> I don't know everything.<eos> No one does.
I can't stop thinking about it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Mr. Gilford's in the lobby.<eos> I'll be right down.<eos> Gilford.<eos> As in the D.A.?<eos> - It's just lunch, Jake. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You want him on the show, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
Never got over it.<eos> Sold my practice, you know, went into emergency psychiatry.<eos> Swore I would never get that involved in anyone's life again.<eos> Look, Sarah, it was wrong of me to dismiss your feelings for Danny.<eos> You know, my issues are my issues, not yours.<eos> Look, I really need you to trust me.<eos> Seeing him outside a clinical setting is a terrible idea, especially given the people he's involved with.<eos> But...<eos> But if you insist on...<eos> I do.
Now, she can go find her own damn liver.<eos> No cuts.<eos> So... your answer is no?<eos> My answer is hell no.<eos> Right?<eos> Granny's gonna get a liver today.<eos> That was...<eos> Really unexpected.<eos> Didn't see that coming.<eos> You didn't.
Diaper.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> Give me another diaper.<eos> We're gonna double up on this.<eos> Smart.<eos> Hey, you're good at this.<eos> Well, I just have a knack, I guess.<eos> Babies like me.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, you do.
She's not listening.<eos> They're saying... that without the treatments, the cancer will kill you before the baby's even born.<eos> In a month, two months, you'll both be dead.<eos> I went to court to fight a traffic ticket so I could save $360 so we could buy an organic crib mattress.<eos> This is how my day started.<eos> And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line.<eos> There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.
You shouldn't.<eos> Um, I'll be pretty late, so don't wait up, 'kay?<eos> Um, I'm sorry.<eos> They were supposed to tell you not to wait.<eos> I had a Whipple.<eos> I know.<eos> I waited anyway.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You're right.<eos> We do.
So, you're telling me the hostages, this attack, the bio weapons, the First Lady is all for computer drives?<eos> Those drives contain decades worth of intelligence gathered through surveillance systems the leaders were here to dismantle.<eos> Classified intercepts, clandestine operations, millions of e-mails, text messages.<eos> You want to get to them before the terrorists do.<eos> The terrorists already have them.<eos> They're useless without someone capable of decrypting them.<eos> Someone like Eric Boyer?<eos> We have to destroy the drives before the terrorists figure out how to decrypt them.<eos> How do I know you're not leading me into a trap?<eos> You don't.
Yes, and there'd be nothing left to do because he'd be dead.<eos> Unlikely.<eos> Amelia, Edwards can keep an eye on him.<eos> If something happens, he would be paralyzed before I got here.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Enid, you're stable right now.<eos> We've got you on a nitro drip, beta-blockers, anticoagulants.<eos> Yeah, we're concerned you might've had a small heart attack.<eos> What... What do we do now?
It's not important enough to argue about.<eos> I have let it go.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> I mean, you don't...<eos> All day, it's been... Can we just set a reset button and move forward?<eos> I am moving forward... by myself, apparently, because you can't be bothered to sleep at home.<eos> I've had patients.<eos> Every night for the past two weeks?<eos> - You didn't have to stay here.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Because without it, we make poor decisions, we say things we shouldn't.<eos> And sometimes we see things that aren't there.<eos> What do we got?<eos> MVC with abdominal trauma, severely hypotensive since he arrived.<eos> FAST exam show a fluid in the upper right quadrant, lots of it.<eos> It's gonna be a long night.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I haven't slept in 48 hours.<eos> Thought I saw you go home earlier.<eos> You did.
- Oh, that sounds...<eos> - Then a GSW to the abdomen that Edwards caught...<eos> a duodenal repair.<eos> Wa... How long have you been here?<eos> What day is it?<eos> Scalpel.<eos> How do you know when you're too tired to operate?<eos> Right about when you make your first mistake.<eos> I hate that answer.<eos> You don't.
I disagree with your decision.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, but...<eos> - But what?<eos> - But he's not your patient!<eos> My hands are in his body.<eos> I would think that would make him as much my patient as yours or Dr. Hunt's.<eos> But it's still my call.<eos> Look, we've got three attendings here, and a senior resident.<eos> We need to discuss the options.<eos> - No, we don't.
Yeah.<eos> Big... big second half.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Actually, no.<eos> Um, what did you mean before when... when you said...<eos> "Promise me we'll never have kids"?<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> Yeah, but... you did.
Just, um, let's... let's... let's give it like, 30 more seconds.<eos> Okay.<eos> You'll still be able to work more.<eos> I can work less.<eos> We'll get a nanny.<eos> Or a manny.<eos> God, no.<eos> You know, if you still want<eos> - that vacation house you can...<eos> - I don't.
Nah.<eos> The scariest part is leaving the hospital with the baby.<eos> Babies.<eos> Babies, of course.<eos> Doc, these two, they only fall asleep if they're next to each other.<eos> Is that unusual?<eos> Well, they've been sharing the same hot tub the last nine months; you can't bust them up right away.<eos> No, I'm not concerned.<eos> Did she tell you what we named them?<eos> No, actually, she didn't.
I think she might be a little broken.<eos> You know, I-I think the babies might have broken my wife.<eos> You can fix her, right?<eos> Or you can tell me how to fix her?<eos> I was... I was hoping you could tell me<eos> - how to fix her.<eos> - Sit down, Jack.<eos> She lost a baby, Jack.<eos> You can't just dismiss that.<eos> - So did I. - Yeah.
How'd it go?<eos> It's bad.<eos> Nothing to be done, really.<eos> Some experimental treatments that'll give him a few more months.<eos> He's upstairs resting.<eos> Peacefully with his arms crossed over his chest, no doubt.<eos> I have no idea how I came from that man.<eos> I'm so sorry, babe.<eos> Yeah, I don't know what I expected.<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah, Kate, you're fired.<eos> Why?<eos> You're the personal assistant to your brother, all right?<eos> A brother who locks himself in his master bedroom closet.<eos> A master bedroom closet that happens to have a mini-bar in it.<eos> Maybe it's time we go at it alone for a while, you know?<eos> Just for a little while to see what happens.<eos> You know, maybe we need to grow up a bit.<eos> I don't really know who I am if I'm not your sister.<eos> I do.
You can sit on that chair.<eos> Guys, I present you Jordi P... The education inspector.<eos> Okay. Hello, good morning.<eos> Hello.<eos> Good morning, Jordi!<eos> Well, as I've said, guys, today we'll finish point 2 from the book now that we have the time.<eos> I don't want us to be in hurry at the end of the year facing the selectivity.<eos> Yes?<eos> But you don't follow the book.<eos> Okay, I do it my way.
No, you get me, it's okay.<eos> Fuck, I think...<eos> - I can see right away that he's a guy.<eos> - No, Berta. She's nice.<eos> But is Quima gay or straight?<eos> Because obviously, he's a man but now a woman. Then does she like men or women..?<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> Anyway, you two are gay. I'm sure it's your thing.<eos> What does it have to do with me being gay?<eos> Of course it does, Bruno.
I'm not pregnant.<eos> You are happy.<eos> Gina. All this tension...<eos> I wanted it but you didn't.<eos> Frankly, I didn't.<eos> I don't know. If it happened, go ahead.<eos> But ... I don't know, maybe we can think about it in the future.<eos> Yes?<eos> No, Gina.<eos> I do.
Won't you say anything else?<eos> Dad, I know that you're upset. But can't you cheer for me?<eos> Yes, I'm glad. You know why?<eos> Because I'll have more space when you're gone.<eos> I'll settle in your room tomorrow.<eos> I won't wait until you leave.<eos> Why don't you go live with Coralina those last days?<eos> Since she understand you well.<eos> Have you ever thought that you and Coralina are the same? Don't you say what you think?<eos> So does she.
I know. But if your son had fever, wouldn't you stay with him?<eos> Pau, I can't imagine myself having children. Mom takes care of us from the hospital!<eos> She gave you the syrup and she can afford it thanks to the job she is doing there.<eos> And when she leaves, she wants to be with her other half.<eos> I understand, because I don't have a girlfriend and I would like to.<eos> When I was 11, she gave an unwrapped gift.<eos> Oh yeah? So?<eos> Does mom want to give me gifts?<eos> Look, Pau, I'll get mad.<eos> Of course she does.
Hurry up, honey.<eos> Was that about Kensi?<eos> Um... yeah.<eos> That was... that was-- God bless her, that was my mom.<eos> Ah, wonderful woman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had a good talk with her at the hospital.<eos> Well, she thinks that Kensi's gonna wake up and everything's gonna be fine, so...<eos> But you don't?<eos> No, I-I do.
My name is Rex.<eos> And your first name is?<eos> Her first name is Special.<eos> Um... do you recognize this?<eos> Sure, it's a crankset from Nakahamo Racing.<eos> The best.<eos> Well, depends on what your needs are.<eos> But for performance, this is it.<eos> Do you ride?<eos> No, she doesn't.
Uh-huh. Yeah.<eos> Petty Officer Brown, you're in navigation?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I worked under Lieutenant Mills.<eos> Strict.<eos> Hard worker.<eos> But she just joined the ship, sir.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I didn't know her personally, sir.<eos> None of us did.
Yeah, well, I hope you're flexible, because you can kiss your ass good-bye when I get done with you.<eos> You already caused me problems, Stewart, so just get there.<eos> My brother says he doesn't know who signed on the ship as him.<eos> But he was headed up to meet me and my mom in Norfolk, so getting to NCIS headquarters won't be a problem.<eos> He's gonna keep his phone on?<eos> Yes.<eos> And if he doesn't answer all of their questions, you have my permission to shoot him.<eos> It'll be a mercy killing.<eos> Not like this job wasn't hard enough before, you know?<eos> I do, actually.
Well, welcome to the lab.<eos> Cool.<eos> Hopefully, these solar lights still work.<eos> Yeah, you'll be safe here.<eos> You sure?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No one can see us from the road, and nobody in the whole world knows about this place, except for me and my best friend.<eos> We built it together.<eos> After my mom died.<eos> Mine did, too.
Perhaps I should call him over so you can explain your policy on confidentiality.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Sonia Bloom.<eos> Adrian Shaw.<eos> Cheers.<eos> What the hell was that all about?<eos> Who's Sonia Bloom?<eos> Apparently, Adrian Shaw.<eos> You didn't care about The Coroner.<eos> No, I didn't.
- Hi, Tina.<eos> - Hi. Some of Louie's medical files came across my desk.<eos> - Is something wrong?<eos> - No, not at all. But I saw in Louie's files that the court has granted permanency placement for him after 90 days.<eos> Meaning?<eos> There's a fast track process if you want to adopt.<eos> The one disclaimer I'll throw at you is the court will view you, Gabby, as a single parent.<eos> Even... even though we're living together?<eos> Yes. But here's the paperwork if you want to get started.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
Yes.<eos> Well, Nancy, this is a safe place.<eos> You can talk about anything that you want here.<eos> - Your workplace...<eos> - You can talk about relationships...<eos> I, for example, just got out of a serious relationship.<eos> With a woman.<eos> So...<eos> Nancy, I had no idea... that you knew anything about this stuff.<eos> I didn't, until your interview today.
Ozzie's my coworker.<eos> It is amazing what we learn about one another when we share with one another.<eos> And with that in mind, Ozzie, I'm gonna ask you to begin tonight.<eos> Sure. Yeah. Sharing.<eos> Sharing.<eos> You had a pretty big day.<eos> Why don't we start there?<eos> - Gerry, come on.<eos> - You got my note!<eos> - Yeah, I did, Gerry.
I'm being hunted... by the Akkadian.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Nothing?<eos> You don't know who the... oh, my God.<eos> - How do you still have a job?<eos> - Fine...<eos> - what's the Akkadian?<eos> - It's a myth.<eos> It's an assassin so lethal it's able to reach targets in such untouchable locations that the intel community doesn't believe it even exists.<eos> Yeah, and neither does Snopes, apparently.
Mum!<eos> Mum!<eos> The pilot, Lieutenant Barnhill.<eos> OK.<eos> Catch your breath.<eos> They're hitting him in the byre.<eos> Ned and Mickey Joe and all those bullies. They're hurting him!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Barney, did you know about this?<eos> I did not, Mr. Coyne.
What if he is killed in action?<eos> She is too young to know that a young man went to his death thinking of her.<eos> You may tell him I took it, but I reserve the right not to pass it on to her.<eos> It would cast a shadow over her life.<eos> I understand.<eos> Mrs. Coyne.<eos> You knew.<eos> What?<eos> What was being planned.<eos> I didn't.
Maybe we can use that.<eos> You know, give our kids a little glimpse into their future.<eos> Scare 'em straight.<eos> Ooh, I like it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, in the last day, our kids have engaged in vandalism, conspiracy and racketeering.<eos> I don't really know what that is, but they make a hell of a racket.<eos> Okay, you guys know Uncle Don.<eos> What you don't know is that he is also a father.<eos> Yeah, we do, to cousin Mikey.
- I found diaries.<eos> All the way from, uh, '85 to when she was taken in '94.<eos> Um, I'll start there and work my way back.<eos> She wrote a lot about a hometown boyfriend.<eos> - Mateo Rivera, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I read about him in the police report.<eos> Word was, he beat her, but they could never make a case.<eos> - He had an alibi.<eos> - Yeah, well, so did O.J.
Hey.<eos> That all I get for a workplace drop by?<eos> Hellos and good-byes aren't really your thing, huh?<eos> I'm sorry about the other night.<eos> Dinner's on me.<eos> You're spoiling me rotten, Sullivan.<eos> Well, when you're done with that, I'm putting you to work.<eos> We're combing through and searching for any mention of a girl named Meghan.<eos> Meghan have a last name?<eos> She does not.
You blew up my life.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> At least I have the balls to tell you what I'm doing to your face.<eos> I've been taking care of myself.<eos> All right.<eos> I made choices.<eos> But you're making choices now too.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Even if I got out today, it doesn't matter.<eos> It never did.
One of the only ones.<eos> Like an elephant up here. - Yo.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> Yeah, I gotta go.<eos> We'll pick this up at the site.<eos> What you doing, man...<eos> Amani Hill, huh?<eos> What, are you running a halfway house for ex-cops now?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> 'Cause before, you didn't.
Mr. President, step away from the desk.<eos> The toxicologist just performed the spot test for thallium poisoning.<eos> It was positive, sir.<eos> There's no way Atwood could have known it was thallium.<eos> - Not unless he did it.<eos> - It doesn't make sense.<eos> You work your entire career, build a perfect record, ascend to the position of deputy director, and then throw it all away?<eos> Nassar boasted about killing nearly a thousand people.<eos> Atwood knew most of them.<eos> We all did.
You did a final polish, right?<eos> You know, we had a deal, and you broke it.<eos> Next time you try to be a Woodward, pick a better Bernstein than Jared Abbott.<eos> Look, to be fair, all I said was that I wouldn't run with the story, and I didn't.<eos> No, you just gave it to somebody else.<eos> Seth, come on.<eos> Like it or not, it is news.<eos> Maybe not to you, but to millions of Americans about to cast their votes tomorrow, the president's relationship with the truth means something.<eos> I like you.<eos> Seth, I really do.
The FBI just handed in their report, and it concludes that Jason Atwood did, indeed, kill Majid Nassar.<eos> That's incredible.<eos> I asked Ms. Jordan to stay on as a White House correspondent to keep us honest.<eos> She kept up her end of the bargain.<eos> We need to do the same.<eos> Tell her we'll give her an exclusive on the man that we have in custody, but she's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.<eos> I know you didn't want it to be true.<eos> None of us did.
Do you know who this belongs to?<eos> Do you?
Cássia, I want you to find out everything you can about this candidate, okay?<eos> I'm not sure about this test.<eos> I don't know if it's selecting who we need for the Offshore.<eos> What about these plants, huh?<eos> Who picked these for you?<eos> Why couldn't I have picked them myself?<eos> Of course.<eos> Your office...<eos> you have no pictures in here.<eos> No, I don't.
He's all alone, Ezequiel.<eos> In a few years, he will apply to the Process.<eos> If he passes, you will meet again.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> Then he doesn't deserve to be missed at all.<eos> Because he's one of them...<eos> not one of us.<eos> -It doesn't work like that, Ezequiel.<eos> -Julia...<eos> It doesn't.
-Can I contact you in a bit?<eos> -Sure.<eos> Very good news.<eos> Very good, indeed.<eos> We got rid of that problem.<eos> Here I come.<eos> You shouldn't have seen this.<eos> I found you!<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Do you? !
I'll go wherever you go.<eos> It doesn't matter where.<eos> -Fernando, no--<eos> -No, I'm serious.<eos> I don't care about passing the Process as long as we end up on the same side.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> First candidate.<eos> Joana is done.<eos> Next.<eos> Done, why?
This wasn't a stroke.<eos> I ran a blood test... and it tested positive for batrachotoxin.<eos> -What? -What?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why would anyone want to poison César?<eos> What if he wasn't the target?<eos> The hall doesn't have as many cameras as I'd like.<eos> -What?<eos> That's absurd.<eos> -It doesn't!
...in the name of a fair society...<eos> "...and to only enter the Offshore..."<eos> ...and to only enter the Offshore...<eos> "...duly purified."<eos> ...duly purified.<eos> Relax your arm.<eos> Welcome to the three percent!<eos> Welcome to the three percent, Michele.<eos> Anyone else in my place would have killed you.<eos> Why didn't you?
I had an idea what it was, so I looked into it.<eos> That picture was taken on Russell's phone.<eos> His case was broken, and a piece of plastic was sticking out over the camera.<eos> Police thought it had been damaged during the murder.<eos> But then I remembered seeing a picture at his place with the same obstruction.<eos> So the case had been broken for some time.<eos> Russell was the friend you took to Maui.<eos> You were having an affair.<eos> And considering your husband has a memento from the trip, I'm guessing he doesn't know.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.
It's not just enough to know that an asteroid is there.<eos> We need to know which ones are the big ones.<eos> So that, what, Bruce Willis can go nuke it?<eos> Surprisingly, yes.<eos> We've been reading up on this stuff today-- there are proposals in the works to send rockets to asteroids, to nudge them or even blow them up.<eos> So was Cole right?<eos> Are we measuring them wrong?<eos> No idea.<eos> Do we have any idea why a Wall Street guy was studying this stuff in the first place?<eos> We don't.
I want you to know I don't normally go home with guys I've met in bars.<eos> Good.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> This is, um... sparse.<eos> Yeah, you know, I've only been here for about a year, year and a half, so...<eos> That can't be comfortable.<eos> Well, it's better than a standard issue cot.<eos> Military?<eos> Or prison?<eos> I did a couple tours in Iraq.
What report?<eos> I gave Scorsese Miranda's accident report.<eos> So please tell him.<eos> Sorry, Riggs.<eos> There wasn't anything to indicate it wasn't an accident.<eos> What about the tox report?<eos> The driver wasn't drunk.<eos> There was nothing there.<eos> Hey, look, I know how hard this can be.<eos> No, you don't.
Bailiff Dan.<eos> "We need a new Jury Boss.<eos> Harvey is weak.<eos> Here's a gift."<eos> Normally, I would send all of you home and seat new jury, but I'm planning to run for office and I don't want to cost the taxpayers any more money.<eos> Any attempt to bribe your fellow juror will result in all of you being held in contempt!<eos> Bailiff, please collect the bribes.<eos> Harvey ate my orange.<eos> No.<eos> So, did you like the movie?
You got eyes on Kirk?<eos> Aram's trying to locate the escape vehicle.<eos> - Where are you on Dr. Shaw?<eos> - Nowhere.<eos> Reddington got to her.<eos> If we're right and Shaw knows how to cure Kirk,<eos> Reddington has just made sure that's not going to happen.<eos> Which means Liz is his only hope.<eos> Kirk's not gonna hurt her as long as he needs her stem cells to survive.<eos> But he doesn't.
Bouncing around three different women at the same time.<eos> I was a bad guy.<eos> But she saw through my insecurities.<eos> She gave me a chance to be the man that she knew that I could be.<eos> But you know what it's like.<eos> She was in love over this nonsense playboy life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I sure do.<eos> For certain.<eos> No, they don't.
- i said i needed privacy.<eos> This isn't what i meant.<eos> Oh, okay, so you just want me to go?<eos> - come here. That's not what i mean.<eos> - come here. That's not what i mean.<eos> - am i, uh... interrupting anything?<eos> - don't you got someplace to be?<eos> - anyplace else to be?<eos> - not really. - I'll be out in a minute.<eos> Do us a favor...
Come on.<eos> Stupid girl.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello!<eos> Hello!<eos> Is there anybody there?<eos> Hello!<eos> Say a word and I'll murder ya.<eos> I'm gonna cut your head off and bury ya.<eos> Don't... peep.
I've learned that Danilo Lukic is a Sagittarius, he's allergic to corn, and he collects penguin-themed bric-a-brac.<eos> His whereabouts however remain a mystery.<eos> Look, there's something we need to talk about.<eos> I was in court this morning.<eos> You remember Leon Walker?<eos> Killed that bodega owner, fled with cash from the register.<eos> Yeah, $207, if memory serves.<eos> Samuel Cruz.<eos> You said he saw the shooter flee the store?<eos> Yeah, he did.
You walk around like you own the place.<eos> It's annoying.<eos> Mm. It's charming.<eos> Do you want to grab a drink some time?<eos> See?<eos> That.<eos> That is what I mean.<eos> No, I do not want to grab a drink with you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
Oh, I will be the best fish mom.<eos> Uh, really, Abby?<eos> Because growing up, they called me "The Fish Whisperer""<eos> They did not.<eos> They did.<eos> No, they did not.<eos> They did.<eos> - No. They did not.<eos> - They did. - Uh-huh.<eos> They did.
Jankowski is outside the Moonbrite Motel on Wells Avenue in D.C. Thanks, Abbs.<eos> All right.<eos> The winner of the best apartment of anyone we know is...<eos> Torres.<eos> What? !<eos> Who the heck is Torres?<eos> Look, I'm sorry that I ran from you guys.<eos> But do I look like the kind of person that would shoot someone?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Shall we go together?<eos> I'm not in a hurry yet.<eos> You have physics at eight and your teacher, Leino, hates tardiness.<eos> I like this place.<eos> It's kind of small, though.<eos> I don't enjoy driving around in Helsinki.<eos> Every house, every road, every place reminds me of some crime.<eos> I don't have that burden here.<eos> When you asked me if I moved here just for mom or if I had a personal reason...<eos> Well, did you?
-How about this?<eos> That doesn't look familiar either.<eos> What about this?<eos> Who might that be?<eos> Well...<eos> The name of the Audi owner or I'll pierce your head.<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -Where is my daughter?<eos> I don't know!<eos> -Who does?
-This is a prepaid card.<eos> -I think we're in trouble.<eos> -No.<eos> You are.<eos> Don't call me from any number.<eos> I just need a few days, a place to stay.<eos> Degerman's cottage, perhaps.<eos> What have you done?<eos> -Do you want to know?<eos> -No, I don't.
Kari?<eos> Someone knows why Kaminen went in the hotel with an unloaded gun.<eos> Why Mika, not a drug user, died of an overdose.<eos> My methods aren't working.<eos> Let's try Lena's way.<eos> I can go to St. Petersburg, shake things up.<eos> St. Petersburg yes, shaking no.<eos> -We'll send them an assistance request.<eos> -Do you know how long...?<eos> I do.
We don't know who has broken into them or why.<eos> -What do you want to know?<eos> -How often do you guard them?<eos> Any break-ins earlier?<eos> Who has access?<eos> And who knows they're empty?<eos> For starters.<eos> I've been on your side in these situations so many times, it's quite interesting to see it from this perspective.<eos> Niko, if we had any information that could help, I'd tell you.<eos> But we don't.
My name is Kim<eos> I like you, Chris<eos> - Don't talk like that.<eos> - What did I say?<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> Just take this and get the hell out of here.<eos> - Goddamn it.<eos> - Hey. What's going on?<eos> - You don't like her?<eos> - Oh, yes, I do
Hold on a second.<eos> That's an option?<eos> - Well, technically, yes.<eos> - I could just... put her in the other class?<eos> They already have a room parent.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Trust me, you don't want to do that.<eos> - Oh, I think I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Well, technically, yes.<eos> - I could just... put her in the other class?<eos> They already have a room parent.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Trust me, you don't want to do that.<eos> - Oh, I think I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - See, this is one of the issues.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> All right, I've had enough.<eos> I'm transferring Emme out of this class.<eos> Fine.<eos> Here's the transfer form.<eos> - Now, we have a reason to party. - Hmm.<eos> No, we don't.
Well, you're the captain of balloons.<eos> Look, here's what's gonna happen.<eos> I'm gonna go down there tomorrow with you and a box of chocolates, and I'm gonna... kiss her butt some more, and I'm gonna fix this.<eos> I don't need you cleaning up my messes, okay?<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Adam, listen to me, I am the captain now.<eos> Okay, I don't know if this is what you were going for, but I am really turned on right now.<eos> Look, you know what Adam's like.<eos> He-he just says stuff, he doesn't think.<eos> I really don't.
I'll keep you posted.<eos> Earlier today, police searched the home of murder suspect Jake Gregorian, accused killer of Sarah Keaton, wife of tech billionaire Oscar Keaton.<eos> Oscar Keaton was the original suspect in Sarah's murder.<eos> Although Gregorian has been released on bail and ordered to wear a monitoring bracelet to ensure he stays within county limits... his specific whereabouts are unknown.<eos> Gregorian was last seen earlier today entering...<eos> Hey.<eos> Mind if I stay a while?<eos> You know, it's kind of ironic I'm hiding from the media by staying with the media.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> - How you doing?
You on your way?<eos> Food poisoning.<eos> No, no, no, it's okay.<eos> You stay hydrated.<eos> Baby, we're going to make this work.<eos> Did it again, didn't I?<eos> Yep.<eos> But how about we try to salvage the last five minutes of our session and talk about... I don't know, your sleeping problem?<eos> I don't have a sleeping problem.<eos> No, not in here you don't.
Lynn!<eos> Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Weitz, and I am your best friend in this building.<eos> You know why?<eos> Well, look, no matter what happens in this room today, you're going to prison.<eos> Grand larceny, fraud, a whole mess of cyber crimes.<eos> But hey, nice middle-class girl, nonviolent, you're looking at, I don't know, if you're lucky, eight years in a white-collar joint.<eos> You'll be out in plenty of time to get your life started again.<eos> But if these FBI agents turn up dead or they don't turn up at all, then you're looking at a life sentence, Lynn.<eos> Supermax.<eos> And nice middle-class girls, ooh, they don't do so well in there.
Hey, I brought your clothes for tonight.<eos> Oh, thank you honey, that's so sweet.<eos> - How's it going with, um...<eos> - The wi-fi won't work, and this whole place smells like Cup O' Noodles.<eos> Mom, this is April, Rainer's daughter.<eos> - Pleasure to meet you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> So, I'm gonna look for a ladies' room.<eos> Do they have those in factories?<eos> Uh, we do, yes.
Fights between the roommates, unwanted guests, drugs...<eos> Anything that might point the finger away from Maya and towards another suspect.<eos> This is gonna take days.<eos> I suggest you grab yourself a paralegal.<eos> Keep me posted.<eos> Jake, uh, Johnny Weston's father is here?<eos> He says you called him.<eos> I did.<eos> Well, he knows we represent Maya, right?<eos> He does.
You saw Shinwell?<eos> I did.<eos> I offered him to wait in here, but he claimed to prefer the stoop. I don't think he likes me.<eos> I have a feeling it has more to do with the... pervert family tree.<eos> So, did you get everything you needed at TrueRomantix?<eos> Almost.<eos> There's no record of Damien Novak having been a customer there.<eos> Perhaps our predator- predator lured him on a different dating site.<eos> So we still don't know who this guy is.<eos> We do not.
What are you talking about?<eos> You don't even have kids.<eos> - I could have kids.<eos> - Okay, great, but you don't.<eos> I could have several children. - Wow. Amazing.<eos> - You don't know that about me.<eos> You're such an amazing imaginary mom.<eos> You don't know anything about me, actually, Kelly.<eos> I do know a lot more about you than I'd like.<eos> No, no, you don't.
Earth is the only planet we know of where life exists.<eos> And, here, it does so in abundance.
What about you?<eos> Correct shutter speed?<eos> Gordon is hoping that these camera traps will reveal where they're on the prowl.<eos> For the monkey team, finding the animals seems easy...<eos> Steady now, Rob.<eos> Rob, Rob, Rob.<eos> ...but keeping up with them is a different matter.<eos> - He almost stomped on that.<eos> - Ooh! They didn't put that on the hazard assessment.<eos> - They did, as a matter of fact.
Let's find them first.<eos> I'll check Flight Ops.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, need some help?<eos> No.<eos> Just, um... trying to get my card to work.<eos> You got to have the right kind of clearance to get in.<eos> Yes, I'm supposed to have all access, so...<eos> Just like you do.
And you're not an exorcist.<eos> Do you remember what I told you?<eos> That I had too much to lose.<eos> Yeah, and then what happened?<eos> You lost the Rance girl, you lost the love of your life, you betrayed everything you held dear and for what?<eos> What did it get you?<eos> You're gonna die in here.<eos> Unless you wake up right now.<eos> But I don't know how.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You're fucking out of proportion.<eos> They look like a tent on you.<eos> They'll be fine on Darek.<eos> Kamil, let's go.<eos> Don't make such a sorry fucking face.<eos> We're going to the mall tomorrow.<eos> Can I call you daddy?<eos> Yes.<eos> My dad doesn't love me.<eos> Yes, he does.
Hey.<eos> You just made his Christmas.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look.<eos> I guess this goes without saying, but...<eos> You're glad I'm not another psycho hacker hell-bent on ending the world?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That. - Mm.<eos> But, Riley, I will admit, I had my doubts.<eos> He never did, though.
The hippocampus is too deep.<eos> I was thinking of something,<eos> - a little less...<eos> - Brilliant.<eos> ...insane.<eos> Instead of light, we use electricity.<eos> We use neurostimulation to jump-start his hippocampus.<eos> We send electromagnetic pulses that can penetrate brain tissue.<eos> Even if that works, how do we know for certain that Ryan's memories are still in there?<eos> We don't.
No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> So do you remember anything about this?<eos> Us?<eos> No, I'm sorry. I-I don't.<eos> They thought maybe if they brought us out here, it might spark some memories, but...<eos> We should go.<eos> Did we stay for the sunset?<eos> We stayed beyond the sunset.<eos> We did?
Took me three towns to shake 'em.<eos> Yeah, go get dressed.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - This is Lucy and Wyatt.<eos> Lucy and Wyatt, this is one of our best friends, Henry Methvin.<eos> They helped us out with the bank job yesterday.<eos> Did they now?<eos> Guess we were just in the right place at the right time.<eos> And where did you say you were from?<eos> - She didn't.
That takes away her motive.<eos> And we need to start steering public opinion in her favor right now.<eos> Now, for better or worse, your sex tape got huge ratings.<eos> You go back on that show, people will tune in and listen to whatever you have to say.<eos> Jake, I can't do it.<eos> I mean, last time, Louise hijacked the interview, and... and Julia let her do it.<eos> How do we know that won't happen again?<eos> Let me handle that.<eos> You want me to put Dana Hartman back on the air?<eos> Yes, I do, for a good reason.
The network would have understood.<eos> The father was Ronald Teller.<eos> The chairman of the network.<eos> That's why I couldn't say anything.<eos> Because what you're thinking, everyone else would have believed...<eos> That the first female to solo anchor the news slept her way to the top.<eos> Well...<eos> Ronald had been harassing me for years.<eos> - You know his reputation.<eos> - I do.
I cover for my mom all the time.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Yup.<eos> You drink a lot.<eos> You an alcoholic?<eos> Well, that's a very grown-up concept, Ethan.<eos> No biggie.<eos> My dad was one.<eos> You have a wife?<eos> Uh, I did.
By forcing the Senate to pay for his games,<eos> Commodus has secured his revenge.<eos> But Quintianus refuses to admit defeat.<eos> To the Senate.<eos> I'll drink to that.<eos> Well, this is just the first step.<eos> We need to show the Senate that if they cross Commodus again--<eos> We already showed them that.<eos> And you think that's enough?<eos> I do.
It was a total accident; you were getting out<eos> - of your car to go pee. - No!<eos> There was a spider in the car, and I panicked.<eos> Damn it, how did I not guess that?<eos> You gotta see this spider.<eos> It's gigantic.<eos> Charles, this is amazing.<eos> I know, when's the last time you cried like that? - Huh?<eos> You cried?<eos> - Damn right, I did.
I'm Charles, from being on hold, and I want my package.<eos> Yeah, I already told you, that package isn't here.<eos> Well, I made a sacred promise to my son, and you're not gonna make a liar out of me, so why don't you take another look?<eos> We'll wait. 'Cause we've got all... night...<eos> long.<eos> - Damn.<eos> - Oh, I don't know if you knew this, but... I'm a cop.<eos> So maybe this time, don't lie to me.<eos> Hey, I didn't know you guys were police.<eos> Well, now you do, genius.
I'm gonna pretend none of that was said for the sake of the child.<eos> Wait a minute, is that...<eos> Scully?<eos> ♪ And a partridge in a pear tree ♪ Hey, guys, thought I'd spread the Christmas cheer.<eos> Cool, so you're just out here caroling solo?<eos> Yeah, I guess you could say that.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> He's not solo.<eos> - You guys came.<eos> - Damn right we did.
Like a grown-up Cabbage Patch doll.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, that seems like it'd be a whole lot of e-mails.<eos> It's a hard pass.<eos> But, Principal Brown, you know what they say about a mom who's enthusiastic in the streets.<eos> That's not a saying.<eos> Why are the two of you suddenly so interested in my love life, anyway?<eos> Because we care.<eos> You don't even know my first name.<eos> Yes, we do.
Is this what you do when I'm not here, make really good points?<eos> Look-Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you're hungry you can eat your takeout; nobody touched it.<eos> I think I'm gonna go for a run.<eos> You want to come?<eos> No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming,<eos> "Watch out, he's right behind you."<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, how you doing?
It's not the same with you gone.<eos> If you're looking for a new guy to live with...<eos> -No! - We're good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, no one's gonna tell me?<eos> Okay. Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.<eos> Well, I'd like that, too.<eos> In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I'm not just saying that because it touched your genitals.<eos> You promise?<eos> I do.
They called him the Mozart of Meat.<eos> Sherlock says he knows a little something about genius, and that... "No truly exceptional intellect would knowingly submit flawed work."<eos> Now, the FDA has consistently ruled that if two products are genetically identical, then they're legally the same thing.<eos> Even if one's natural and one's grown in a lab.<eos> Now, Pereya obviously knew that.<eos> So, Sherlock thinks there's no way he would've submitted bad research to the FDA.<eos> So, he went to Next Century Meats, and got them to give us Pereya's undoctored research.<eos> And you're comparing it to the work that was submitted to the FDA.<eos> You think someone doctored Pereya's work?<eos> Sherlock does.
But it's a moonshot.<eos> The greatest predictor of a spinal cord victim's future success is the grueling work he needs to put in post-accident.<eos> Physical therapy, rehab, talk therapy.<eos> It's going to take a herculean effort from Billy.<eos> I'm gonna need him to give me everything that he's got on a daily basis.<eos> I cannot have him wag for a miracle, James.<eos> - Noted.<eos> Let's go talk to him.<eos> - James?<eos> Fine, you do the talking.
Still trying to stay hopeful, James.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Julianna!<eos> Oh, hello, James.<eos> I was just meeting Walt for a bite.<eos> Adorable. Have you been to our dining hall yet?<eos> It's got a robot that serves frozen yogurt.<eos> It's a can't-miss.<eos> Did you get your action figure yet?<eos> Oh, yeah, I did.
So, are you gonna do it now or later?<eos> Do what?<eos> Pitch me on the bioprinting.<eos> James asked you to convince me, didn't he?<eos> That's why we're up here.<eos> Yeah. See?<eos> This is the problem.<eos> He thinks that he can just buy his way around the rules.<eos> - Yes.<eos> He does.
He's six foot.<eos> It wasn't real.<eos> I mean, the things he said to me, just... he just wanted to get me out of the way.<eos> I could tell.<eos> Perhaps he wanted you out of the way so he could take out a rival.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> He didn't do this.<eos> But how do you know that?<eos> I just... I just do.
- No?<eos> You have something good... and beautiful hidden inside of you.<eos> Just as I have something dark and wicked inside of me.<eos> We're perfect for each other.<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we have to change.<eos> Become better people.<eos> What if I don't want to change?<eos> You do.
Look, why are y'all really here?<eos> You looking to stay with me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, then. Well, let's get home.<eos> We got a busy week ahead of us.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You want to stay with me, you got to contribute.<eos> My shampoo girl got pregnant and quit... again.<eos> You know how to shampoo hair?<eos> She do.
Guys. But really weird.<eos> One had these eyes, and the other one was huge and hairy.<eos> Trainers, who want to train me in... ch... uh... chess.<eos> - Tro...?<eos> Tr... trainers!<eos> And why would that have you so perturbed?<eos> They really weirded me out.<eos> Tick-tock. Tick-tock.<eos> Now, I think I know what has you so distraught, Jim.<eos> You do?
I can't kill this thing.<eos> I nearly had dinner with it.<eos> Neither of us are killers.<eos> I am.<eos> You are?<eos> Detective Snuggles.<eos> Nana warned me not to leave my chocolate lying around.<eos> But it was just after Easter, and I had pulled in a big haul.<eos> I never thought that cat would find my stash.<eos> But he did.
Good night, Tobes.<eos> - There's no way I'm going to make you...<eos> - Go to bed, Tiny Jim.<eos> By morning rise, the dark deed will be done and my soul will be damned.<eos> What's wrong, Tiny Jim?<eos> Did you not sleep well in Nana's dollhouse?<eos> - Why am I still small, Toby? - I don't know.<eos> Maybe stuff works differently on trolls than it does on humans.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> The gnome! You did it?
For as long as it lasts.<eos> The Janus Order has sent me.<eos> They are starting to question your leadership.<eos> They are worried... you don't have everything in control.<eos> As long as his ring is on my finger, I can control him.<eos> But how long will that finger be on your hand?<eos> We have information to suggest the Trollhunter possesses the Birthstone.<eos> They weren't supposed to know about that.<eos> I thought you burned the books.<eos> I did.
Maybe everyone's ditching.<eos> -No, they're not!<eos> -They must be ditching.<eos> ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD<eos> Okay.<eos> -We made it? -We made it.<eos> Holding hands, feeding him bento...<eos> It's as if Arisa likes Arman.<eos> -What?<eos> She does.
-No, they're not!<eos> -They must be ditching.<eos> ARISA OHATA, 25 YEARS OLD ARMAN BITARAF, 24 YEARS OLD<eos> Okay.<eos> -We made it? -We made it.<eos> Holding hands, feeding him bento...<eos> It's as if Arisa likes Arman.<eos> -What?<eos> She does.<eos> -She does.
There's nothing wrong with that.<eos> I don't really want to be seen that way.<eos> I totally came to find a girlfriend.<eos> -That's right!<eos> -I announced that already.<eos> That's right.<eos> We haven't talked like this in a while.<eos> We haven't talked like this in a while.<eos> -We don't usually talk so much.<eos> -Yeah, we don't.
Old man.<eos> Need a soda, old man?<eos> I can't speak of other people.<eos> That's so true.<eos> You're like that, too.<eos> Really?<eos> You seem so suave.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I don't talk at all. Should I take this off?<eos> He really doesn't.
Accents are nice, though.<eos> When they say "Can you help me?" with the accent...<eos> -It sounds so good.<eos> -Yeah, I wanna be told "Why not?"<eos> Stop.<eos> Now it's hard for me to talk.<eos> Do you have a boyfriend?<eos> I don't.<eos> -Do you have a girlfriend?<eos> -He doesn't.
Okay.<eos> I'll shut up and watch.<eos> -This is messed up.<eos> -This is a little...<eos> When they were having breakfast,<eos> Natsumi made... some effort and tried to be friendly.<eos> She did.<eos> She found the meat and said, "What's this?"<eos> -I felt her effort.<eos> -We all did.
So, Arman, people in Hawaii don't really work.<eos> -That's true.<eos> -When I was in Hawaii... I looked at the stones lining the streets of Waikiki.<eos> I even watched the gardeners in the hotels.<eos> -But they go home around 3:00 p.m.<eos> -They do.<eos> -They're often called slackers.<eos> -Really?<eos> But really... no one works as hard as you.<eos> -You do good work for us.
I loved Mantastic and Goldman Sex.<eos> Liza, just what are we gonna do about this party?<eos> I spent the last year like a little mouse in my little mouse house typing and typing, and now I just want to have a good time.<eos> Of course.<eos> That's what we're here for.<eos> I want this party to be epic.<eos> I want hot men and live peacocks and young people that no one would ever think to invite to something like this, because they're under the radar and much too interesting to bother.<eos> They're on the cusp.<eos> Do you know what I'm saying, Liza?<eos> Um, yes, yes, I do.
Me?<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Oh, God, please tell me you're not one of those earnest millenials who's never had a cigarette and thinks her parents are heroes.<eos> Nope.<eos> Definitely not.<eos> Guess who's just been promoted to point person on the She-donism party?<eos> What?<eos> Diana is giving up control?<eos> Annabelle wants a younger vibe.<eos> Of course she does.
Don't be shy.<eos> I used to babysit a girl who was very shy.<eos> What was her name?<eos> Kaitlyn.<eos> And you know what Kaitlyn loved?<eos> What?<eos> Polly Pockets.<eos> So do I!<eos> It's too bad we don't have any here that we could play with.<eos> We do!
Be good.<eos> It's so difficult being married to a renowned author.<eos> Women literally throw themselves at Anton.<eos> They think baiting a literary giant will give meaning to their miserable little lives.<eos> Well, I suppose some of the...<eos> Those little groupies?<eos> They're disgusting.<eos> And you know the women I'm talking about, yes?<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
But I agree.<eos> I agree.<eos> Don't take any chances.<eos> The exterminator comes in one hour.<eos> I am going to stay at my cousin's in Riverdale.<eos> When she steals her kids' Ritalin, she's really fun.<eos> So I'll see you kids in two days.<eos> Good luck. Ugh!<eos> Oh, you're looking at me like I have cooties.<eos> You don't, do you?
Get me a copy ASAP.<eos> And clean up those damn scarves.<eos> Cubicle looks like a Stevie Nicks estate sale.<eos> Well, that can't be good.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We are not gonna let her kill this buzz.<eos> We're gonna go out and celebrate tonight.<eos> Thad and I will take Josh and you out to dinner.<eos> Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I... I found a book in the slush pile that I'm kind of excited about.<eos> You're excited about the slush pile.<eos> Oh, well, perfect.<eos> Then, when you're done with those, you can read my junk mail.<eos> Do you want to split an appetizer?<eos> Yeah, uh, maybe the "geh-nocchi"?<eos> Actually, it's pronounced "gnocchi."<eos> What?<eos> Why hasn't anybody ever told me this?<eos> 'Cause you do it so cute.
Of course not.<eos> [sighs] That's good.<eos> You know what? I...<eos> I'm actually... I'm just gonna tell you some things about me because I'm not really sure you've been paying attention.<eos> So I am the type of guy that likes to play bad music with his buddies at the bar around the corner.<eos> I'm someone who actually enjoys listening to the J Train as it's rattling outside my window because I know that it's filled with all kinds of wonderful people that are just living their lives.<eos> I like smoggy sunsets,<eos> I like smoking pot, and I would much rather experience the world than read about it in some book.<eos> Of course. I know that.<eos> Do you?
I tried to look up some of the author's other work, but I couldn't find anything online.<eos> That's because she's never been published.<eos> - Oh, you're kidding.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> She's never been... how is that possible?<eos> I know.<eos> It's hard to believe.<eos> An editor friend of mine discovered her.<eos> This friend needs to get this published.<eos> Yes, she does.
- Since 3 weeks, sir.<eos> That is it. I wanted a job.<eos> He said he could get me a job in the Middle East!<eos> On one condition.... First I had to help him do this robbery.<eos> I didn't know he had a loaded gun.<eos> -Who fired the gun?<eos> I was driving, sir.<eos> - Huh!<eos> You were driving? So who fired the gun?<eos> -He did.
8 pm.<eos> 8 pm.<eos> 8 pm is my dinner time.<eos> See you.<eos> Bye, sir.<eos> Did you tell anyone about Harman?<eos> I never told anyone.<eos> Be honest, and I won't harm you.<eos> I said I didn't tell anyone...<eos> Yes, I did.
You're good at it, keep this one for me.<eos> Will you get me a discount?<eos> Your wife and kid's killer is dead.<eos> I know.<eos> So you must know...why he turned himself over to the police?<eos> Took the blame for your crimes.<eos> To give you a second chance.<eos> Everyone doesn't get a second chance.<eos> Liak didn't get it, I didn't.<eos> But you did.
Well, isn't East Berlin getting rather...<eos> Oh, yes, the place is getting complicated.<eos> Yeah, complicated.<eos> The Soviet side has been setting up checkpoints for the past few months to try to stop people hemorrhaging to the Western sectors, and it hasn't worked.<eos> We have intelligence to suggest that they may go one step further and wall off the entire Eastern sector.<eos> Okay, that's it in a nutshell.<eos> The decision is entirely yours.<eos> You need time to kick it around.<eos> No.<eos> - No, I don't.
All right, during which I can sleep and you can squeeze nutrient paste into my mouth.<eos> Don't count on it, ma'am.<eos> US warship on exercises just collided with a Greek fishing boat.<eos> - Two fatalities, ma'am. - Oh.<eos> Yeah, we're looking at a big, fat Greek funeral.<eos> I'll arrange for you to make a statement, ma'am.<eos> Yeah, 'cause I'm the president, see?<eos> Everything's my fault now.<eos> Hey, do I have time to talk to Jim and Dan and Mike?<eos> - Uh, no, you don't.
My favorite White House social secretary!<eos> Did you hear about the centerpieces?<eos> I did.<eos> I heard you sent them back to centerpiece hell.<eos> I know.<eos> We felt they weren't right.<eos> So this is coming from the president?<eos> It's coming from us.<eos> And the painting, she wants that swapped out, too?<eos> Yes, we do.
- But I'm happy to do it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Most of the time you don't even know that I exist, but I am fucking everything to you!<eos> Oh, I am so happy to get somebody else to give me my hand cream.<eos> - Okay, go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can you find somebody else who did what I did?<eos> - You mean on Labor Day?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did.
- Okay.<eos> Most of the time you don't even know that I exist, but I am fucking everything to you!<eos> Oh, I am so happy to get somebody else to give me my hand cream.<eos> - Okay, go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can you find somebody else who did what I did?<eos> - You mean on Labor Day?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> You just did.
'Cause that's the speculation, you know.<eos> What do you think, Karen?<eos> About something specific, or...<eos> Should the President and I have swapped roles?<eos> For?<eos> For the election. This election.<eos> There's an election going on.<eos> Oh, Well... (SCOFFS)<eos> Well, you're asking me a hypothetical question, and I need to answer it as best I can.<eos> Okay, well, you just did.
- Oh! No way!<eos> I said we should have gone back there.<eos> And you were right.<eos> Why did you ever resign?<eos> It's hard to understand.<eos> I think Pennsylvania is the real significant call tonight.<eos> Pennsylvania, you had that as a Meyer win, is that right, Matty?<eos> (STUTTERING) Yeah...<eos> Yes. That's...<eos> Yes, we did.
Okay.<eos> She said she's losing her voice.<eos> Just heard from a reporter who says Moyes thinks the White House hired lobbyists to destroy its own bill.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> She said you fucked up, Ben.<eos> And I'm mad as hell that you put Gary in the shit.<eos> You need to get him out.<eos> - She didn't say that, Gary.<eos> - Yes, she did.
Mike, were you at work today?<eos> I don't remember seeing you.<eos> Next memo.<eos> Ben, Moyes is asking questions.<eos> This isn't gonna lead to any kind of an investigation, is it?<eos> Memo deleted.<eos> I fucking hope not.<eos> Do you solemnly that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.<eos> So help me God.<eos> Yes, I do.

If they want to negotiate using hostility and rudeness, well, they picked the wrong guy.<eos> Well, you see, our main concern is how you're going to achieve escape velocity on your growth rate. -(CHUCKLING) -if critical mass...<eos> I'm sorry. What's funny?<eos> It's just that painting behind you.<eos> It's awful.<eos> It looks like harlequin Kama-sutra done poorly.<eos> So, I agree, bad culture fit.<eos> I think we all just move on.<eos> Look, I didn't say anything about a culture fit.<eos> No, I did.
I love you.<eos> I'm... I mean I...<eos> Are you freakin' out a bit, now?<eos> A little bit.<eos> I've never said that before.<eos> What?<eos> Not even to your mom?<eos> We don't say that in my family.<eos> But...<eos> I do.
No, I want to see him.<eos> I need to see him.<eos> Oh god.<eos> Would you please take these away from me?<eos> After I have one more, and then take them away.<eos> And then when the nausea passes, give them back to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Before you go back there, you need to know, he may not look exactly the way you remember him.<eos> I don't want to see the body.<eos> I really don't, actually.
Well, well, well.<eos> So, it's true.<eos> The princess of coral gables somehow conned her way into a job. Huh.<eos> I guess somebody told somebody that I'm a good guy.<eos> Oh, well, if it was me, you're welcome.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, this first week, I'm not even supposed to answer the phone if it rings?<eos> Guess they're waiting to see if I fuck up.<eos> Oh, they are.<eos> So, maybe don't.
You see that? Dreams come true. Told you.<eos> Good.<eos> I need this, Dor.<eos> Fuck. I don't have anything else.<eos> What the fuck happened? What is going on?<eos> Don't say that you have me, all right?<eos> You have me.<eos> And you have... you...<eos> Up till about 10 seconds ago, I was gonna say you have Lynn, but...<eos> Well, I didn't.
Yes.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Oh. Jesus.<eos> Oh. - Sorry.<eos> You scared the shit out of me.<eos> Well, it is Halloween.<eos> What are you playing?<eos> Oh, just something I've already beaten about 15 times, I just haven't gotten the perfect score yet.<eos> Here I am thinking you're shaming me by working on the weekend.<eos> Well, I sort of did some work.
That's all proprietary.<eos> fuck Gina"?<eos> Would you believe that was here when we came in?<eos> Double-A?<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Leave me alone for a sec. What's up?<eos> Well, okay, uh, I just saw a version of the player window that apparently you approved of that says Powered by Homicide on it?<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah, it does.
He's talking about this crack-addict prostitute we saw at the gas station.<eos> She was smoking cigarettes.<eos> So sad.<eos> People are lunatics about smoking here.<eos> We don't enjoy all the freedoms that you have in China.<eos> All right?<eos> Where people smoke all the time.<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> Expt for special occasions.<eos> So you do smoke?
I hear you. [cell phone ringing]<eos> Yeah.<eos> [stammering] Hi, sweetie.<eos> No, i'm at the dentist.<eos> I lost a crown.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Be back soon.<eos> [whimpers] i got to go.<eos> - You know, i'm a writer too.<eos> - Oh, no. No, i did not.
I was just sleeping.<eos> I've been walking in the rain.<eos> So,whathappened toyourboyfriend, theCanadianguy?<eos> HewentbacktoCanada.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I remember how you used to play.<eos> In high school.<eos> I would listen to you outside of the music room.<eos> I just had the strangest dream.<eos> Well, one time, I did that.
Itwaslikesomethingalive thatcouldn'tbreathe.<eos> Timgeerhelpedme.<eos> He knows about these things.<eos> I keep hearing that name.<eos> I haven't even seen the guy.<eos> We needed someone to find the arsonist.<eos> Shane.<eos> Tim knew you would do it.<eos> How did he know that?<eos> He just does.
That's why you sent us away.<eos> What?<eos> You knew my fucked up family would be shark bait for that thing, so you got rid of us.<eos> Wait, it isn't like that at all...<eos> Sure it is!<eos> You thought Gerhart was gonna turn so you sent us away knowing that he would come after us.<eos> You sacrificed us for Krampus to save your selfish old ass!<eos> Oh, please, please, now calm yourself.<eos> You don't know the forces that you are playing with.<eos> Yes I do.
The only reason we're not is because the sheriff's busy.<eos> If he wasn't busy, he'd probably drag us right out onto Main Street, slit our throats.<eos> - Ethan is not Pope.<eos> He's not gonna do that.<eos> - You're probably right.<eos> - He'll probably just shoot us.<eos> - Franklin!<eos> You add to that the fact that we just about killed his little kid.<eos> You think this guy's going to let us live?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.

~ Well done, Lucy, you found her.<eos> ~ Of course, Dad.<eos> ~ Zeta!<eos> ~ Mr Thomson.<eos> Elias, please.<eos> Tonight, you're a guest.<eos> Daniel?<eos> My, but you've grown into a fine young man.<eos> You know why you're here?<eos> ~ I do.
But why would I kill him?<eos> He was my friend!<eos> A friend who once had an affair with your wife.<eos> But, but I knew about all that years ago!<eos> Yes, you did, so why kill him now?<eos> Perhaps it's easier if... if I show you.<eos> Please, come... come with me.<eos> Please. Come through.<eos> You know, it occurred to me that we only ever had Andre's word that his wife left him all those years ago.<eos> But she did.
It's fantastic.<eos> Can she see us?<eos> They say it can sense thermal radiation. Like snakes.<eos> I thought there were two of them.<eos> There was a sibling in case this one didn't survive infancy.<eos> Where's the sibling?<eos> She ate it.<eos> So, the paddock is quite safe, then?<eos> We have the best structural engineers in the world.<eos> Yeah, so did Hammond.
He asked if we wanted...<eos> We're going out. You're staying home with Lumi.<eos> We got invited to Kemppainen's wedding.<eos> - You don't know him.<eos> Everybody's going. My floorball buddies too.<eos> You went fishing last summer and to a karaoke festival<eos> The festival was last year.<eos> Inari hasn't been anywhere since Lumi was born a year ago.<eos> You haven't wanted to.<eos> - Now she does.
You're not drunk, are you?<eos> - No.<eos> She could've been hit by a car.<eos> - Does the car have safety locks?<eos> Yes.<eos> - No, it doesn't.<eos> - You're right.<eos> No safety locks.<eos> But you have a car seat, right?<eos> - Of course I do.
Know who's the second best?<eos> You're looking at him.<eos> The name's Blinky Bill!<eos> I'm pretty legendary around here.<eos> Any trouble comes our way, I'll give it my famous whip-kick to the guts.<eos> Nope.<eos> Well, trust me. Hyaaa!<eos> You get the idea.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Really?<eos> I think we should go pick up our child.<eos> But can we get breakfast first, just the two of us?<eos> Oh, yeah, let's get breakfast first.<eos> Let me just text my mom.<eos> He'll be okay with Grandma and Pop-pop.<eos> He'll be great.<eos> They'll spoil him.<eos> Did you guys miss me at all or did you guys just had a blast?<eos> No, we did.
They had fresh pastries.<eos> What did he want?<eos> Who?<eos> Francois.<eos> He wanted to know if we still wanted to go sailing.<eos> You're lying.<eos> He asked me for a cigarette.<eos> I started smoking when we got here, and you were here, so I said I was out.<eos> I know you started smoking.<eos> Did you?
We were in the midst of one of the most social phenomenons in history.<eos> What I understand is she got very high shooting up in the Porta-San and couldn't go on.<eos> Finally, Peggy and John Cooke had to push her on stage.<eos> How are y'all?<eos> I mean, How are you out there?<eos> Are you OK?<eos> You're not... You're staying stoned and you've got enough water and you've got a place to sleep and everything?<eos> Because, you know, because we oughta, all of us, I don't mean to be preachy but we oughta remember, and that means promoters too, that music's for grooving, man.<eos> Music's not for putting yourself through bad changes. You don't have to go take anybody's shit, man, just to like music. You know what I mean?<eos> You don't.
Good.<eos> What the hell are they?<eos> They're called horses.<eos> I made them out of Horse Sand.<eos> Hot rolls and marmalade, anyone?<eos> Morning, sir.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Do you still have that newspaper?<eos> Yes, Henry.<eos> I do.
~ An interesting question, my Lord.<eos> In the book De Generibus Artium Magicarum...<eos> I don't care about the book De Generibus Artium Magicarum, sir.<eos> ~ Can you make them appear or not?<eos> ~ I can make it rain, my Lord.<eos> It's rained all winter.<eos> It's only just stopped raining.<eos> You and this other gentleman have been a great nuisance to the army, sir.<eos> These visions you've shown the ministers have convinced them they know how matters stand in Portugal.<eos> They do not.
I do not understand the language.<eos> It mostly concerns the food they wish they were eating and the charms of their absent wives.<eos> Are you married, Major Grant?<eos> A soldier has no business marrying, sir.<eos> It is unfair on the man and unfair on the wife.<eos> You did not think to come to war for jokes and picnics, Mr Strange?<eos> I did not consider it.<eos> I'm sorry, Major Grant, I can think of nothing else.<eos> Perhaps you have some Neapolitans among the prisoners?<eos> No, sir, we do not.
How did this happen,<eos> Marty?<eos> I mean, wow, we had it.<eos> That amazing, magical connection that some people wait their whole lives for, but...<eos> You, you were always terrified of the intimacy.<eos> Weren't you?<eos> I could see it in your eyes the very first day we met.<eos> Which was Wednesday.<eos> I tried to make you feel safe.<eos> I really did.
Come on in.<eos> Holy hell, what happened in here?<eos> I was trying to cook dinner for my fiancé.<eos> Fiancé.<eos> Fiancé.<eos> Wow, that is one of those words that sounds strange if you say it a lot.<eos> Or even once.<eos> So, you need help salvaging the meal?<eos> - Oh. - I kid.<eos> Of course you do.
You may fist with pride."<eos> I still want to do it.<eos> Enough of this.<eos> I see an open bar with our name on it.<eos> Just blend in, just blend in.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm having so much fun right now.<eos> I never want to go home!<eos> I don't have a home!<eos> Shh! Yes, you do!
That's crazy.<eos> Where do you even find doves?<eos> Well, it's not doves.<eos> They were way too expensive.<eos> I just spray-painted some pigeons white.<eos> I don't know if this is a good idea.<eos> Trust me, Bruce.<eos> It has to be special.<eos> Do you think you're the first guy ever to ask her to marry him?<eos> Yes, actually, I do.
God damn it, Cromwell...<eos> Why are you such a... person?<eos> It's not as if you can afford to be.<eos> Smile away!<eos> The King will grant you an audience, but he is preparing a quarrel against you, master.<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> He has a long memory and well remembers when you were a burgess in the Parliament before this - and how you spoke against his war.<eos> I hope he doesn't think still of invading France.<eos> God damn you!<eos> What Englishman doesn't?
I'm telling you, there's no better feeling than helping someone just 'cause you can.<eos> It's better to give than to receive. Ugh!<eos> I could so do a gay joke here.<eos> But I'm not gonna, because I'm a gentleman.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Like when you said it's better to give than receive, I could've said "in the butt."<eos> But I didn't, so...<eos> Class personified.<eos> Look, Ben, do you think I wanted to sell this barbershop to you?<eos> I didn't.
I mean, come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Look at her and look at me, huh?<eos> I am looking at you.<eos> It's like looking at a very hairy 6-year-old. Oh. Oh!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, guess what, Rita?<eos> You talk like a cartoon dinosaur!<eos> No, I do not!
You know what?<eos> I just paid rent, and beer at the park is, like, wicked overpriced,<eos> - So, thanks, anyway.<eos> - No.<eos> Okay, uh, you don't have to buy the beer, but, uh, if you catch a fly ball, I get that.<eos> Thanks, anyway.<eos> Oh, you got plans?<eos> I do not.<eos> Well, don't you want to go to the game?<eos> I really, really do.
Hmm. Is it an open bar?<eos> No? "Passachusetts."<eos> You know, maybe you should try forgiving him.<eos> I mean, what's the point to holding on to this?<eos> Mm, I like a good grudge.<eos> Keeps my edges sharp.<eos> That's why I'm so successful.<eos> Forgiveness is for suckers.<eos> Uh-huh. Remind me again where it says that in the bible.<eos> It doesn't.
I would be like, "you want to go see a movie tonight?"<eos> And I'd be like, "sure, that sounds great."<eos> Yeah. And then I would go, "you want go get drinks before?"<eos> And I'd be like, "no, because then I'd have to pee during the movie."<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's exactly how it would go.<eos> So, what, so then drinks after?<eos> - Yeah, sounds great.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey. How you doing, buddy?
Unless... and I'm just spit-balling here, but if there was some sort of wedged pillow situation, which, when placed under the hips...<eos> All right, you need to stop it right there, Mo!<eos> Just sayin', it would open a fella up like a flower.<eos> Jesus!<eos> That's the last thing I needed, was a visual of blooming' Buzzy!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Just tryin' to figure out what's wrong with him.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He's got a serious gambling problem.<eos> - He does?
- I mean it, A.J... - anybody who's not in this game should just get off the roof now.<eos> - Buzz, come on...<eos> All right.<eos> I can't believe they've been going at it for three hours.<eos> Yeah, just like Robin and that guy from the reception in the shark costume. Huh?<eos> That's funny.<eos> I thought sharks had no natural predators.<eos> I'll take three.<eos> Oh, Buzzy's got a lousy hand.<eos> Yes, he does.

It was horrible.<eos> He's like a shadow.<eos> And he has this thing, like a... like a hammer or a hatchet... wait, what do you mean, "like a shadow"?<eos> Like...<eos> Like smoke.<eos> Like he's made out of smoke.<eos> Why didn't you tell us this before?<eos> You would have thought I was crazy.<eos> I mean, things like that don't just happen...<eos> Do they?
God, no.<eos> She was feeling rough so I gave her some of my migraine tablets.<eos> They're quite strong.<eos> That and a Night Nurse.<eos> She was dead set on going out.<eos> I think...<eos> Maybe it reacted with something.<eos> Did you know she'd already dosed herself up on paracetamol?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
12th.<eos> Did she buy anything on the 12th?<eos> There's an email showing a receipt from an online store.<eos> Electrical goods, £344.<eos> Well, get onto the store, see what costs £344.<eos> Xbox or iPad.<eos> One-nil to the overgrown schoolboy!<eos> That cash transfer to R Synnott,<eos> - how do we know that's Ryan?<eos> - We don't.

She just liked their company.<eos> Felt more herself, I think.<eos> Get drunk with teenage lads, go skinny-dipping, whatever.<eos> Anyway, one of the mums found out, thought it were inappropriate, complained.<eos> How did your dad feel about it all?<eos> Honestly?<eos> It were all too much for him.<eos> He tried to kill himself.<eos> He thinks I don't know that.<eos> But I do.
If I'd have picked it up, I'd have come running.<eos> Hm. Why was your phone off?<eos> I needed a break.<eos> Why do you waive Mr. Raggert's rent?<eos> He was struggling.<eos> He wasn't really able to function.<eos> You know, after his wife died.<eos> He had to take a delivery job.<eos> Do you expect anything in return?<eos> - No. No, I don't.
Front of the queue.-<eos> Where's Ryan?<eos> Upstairs.<eos> Ryan, love.<eos> Just want to ask you a couple of questions about your stag do.<eos> Now, how much had you drunk?<eos> - A lot.<eos> - A lot of champagne?<eos> - No. - I think you had champagne.<eos> No, we didn't.
With my last leg standing next to me,<eos> I should still wrestle with the urges to fight or flee.<eos> It's called "terminal restlessness."<eos> The body fills with adrenaline and feels compelled to go-go-go.<eos> "Go-go-go"?<eos> I've already gone up and gone.<eos> This is posthumous.<eos> You're not dead yet, Abel.<eos> You still have to eat.<eos> No, I don't.
Bedelia.<eos> He attacked me.<eos> Is that your blood?<eos> No.<eos> You were defending yourself?<eos> I was reckless.<eos> This wasn't reckless violence.<eos> It was a controlled use of force.<eos> I know what happened.<eos> Do you?
Yeah, I think I already stumbled into those.<eos> You need to look for clues, piece together lost memories.<eos> What is all this stuff?<eos> Old cases... files on everyone, even before I worked here.<eos> Dates back to 1982, I think.<eos> This is your priest report on your uninvited spiritual guest.<eos> People you hurt or injured while you were possessed.<eos> You're gonna need to make amends with them.<eos> Does it say why it chose me?<eos> No, it doesn't.
Did I really do something when I was possessed that your average scumbag hasn't already done?<eos> That's a pretty bleak outlook, Ava.<eos> You may want to change your perspective.<eos> I got you a little present.<eos> Oh, that's nice.<eos> Thanks for the Jade elephant.<eos> That's...<eos> J.J...<eos> What do you, want do you want from me?<eos> What do you, what do you...
It was you.<eos> You're the guy with Noelle.<eos> So good.<eos> Oh, my god, we had sex!<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was so intense.<eos> Oh, my god, get off me!<eos> Hey.<eos> I have feelings for you.<eos> Ha. I do.
But you've got two hours left on your shift!<eos> I'll catch up with some admin off site.<eos> Rebecca, where are you going?<eos> Look, Giles will inform my department superior.<eos> He'll get you a substitute.<eos> We're just about to start the operation.<eos> I can't take the risk.<eos> Not with kids.<eos> Look, I understand where you're coming from, I...<eos> No offence, but you don't.
It was a few years back.<eos> Cut, please.<eos> I'd prefer it if you waited for neurosurgery.<eos> And I'd prefer neuro were here right now with their fingers in her head, but they're not, and if we wait we lose her.<eos> I'm not happy with you doing a burr hole.<eos> But if I don't do it, she dies.<eos> Look, I know this puts you in a difficult situation.<eos> It puts us all in a difficult position.<eos> Yes.<eos> It does.
We've got no convenience stores, no antidepressants, no World Wide Web.<eos> We're completely self-sufficient and we take care of our own, which is why I'm not very good at asking for help.<eos> But...<eos> I'm doing that now.<eos> Dr. Farragut, if we give you our complete cooperation, do you think you can find this disease, get rid of it?<eos> We're not equipped for containment.<eos> We expected to observe and take samples.<eos> Well, what if you had the right equipment?<eos> Coast guard won't be back for two weeks, so unless you have a helicopter hidden somewhere...<eos> No, we don't.
Children are never alone with the adults.<eos> The children are never alone.<eos> Come.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> What, uh... What did you want to show me?<eos> What do you want to see?<eos> Or maybe you can show me.<eos> Show you what?<eos> What you people have.<eos> What my family on the island doesn't.
Alan, tell me!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Is everything alright?<eos> I'd like to get back to work.<eos> What do these carvings mean?<eos> They don't mean anything.<eos> Then why'd you run out of here as soon as you saw them?<eos> You say you want to stop an outbreak.<eos> How do I know you're telling the truth?<eos> You don't.
Ah, yeah, where are my manners?<eos> You're a funny one.<eos> Lucky Caddy didn't catch you first.<eos> Sometimes... He lets the rabbits run, just so he can have a good chase.<eos> Says it tenderizes the meat.<eos> Only trouble is, when he catches 'em... He eats the eyes all to himself.<eos> We will definitely be sharing yours.<eos> Blue is my favorite color, tastes great with honey.<eos> You eat the honey?<eos> Course we do.
And we would call you...<eos> We seemed crazy, yelling for you all over the place... until finally you would appear.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> "Where were you?"<eos> "Where have you been, son?" I would yell out.<eos> "In the mountains, Mama."<eos> "Higher than the clouds, Auntie," Gustavo would say, laughing.<eos> He...<eos> He always wanted to go farther.<eos> He always did.
Hours after the vote, a military helicopter was dispatched to coordinates just outside Medellín, where Pablo was waiting.<eos> [Eduardo in Spanish] As you know, I come on behalf of President Gaviria and the Colombian government.<eos> This is the offer of our terms for your surrender.<eos> [Steve] Peña and I had to go see it with our own eyes.<eos> A terrorist, a drug dealer and a murderer surrendering to a grateful nation who gave him everything he asked for.<eos> It was the closest we'd ever come to him, and we never felt further away.<eos> [Pablo in Spanish] All right, then.<eos> Let me hand over my gun.<eos> - You won.<eos> - We both did.
This is crazy.<eos> Excuse me. Can I say something?<eos> And then it happened.<eos> When confronted with actual injustice, even if it was small-scale, in the spirit of Dr. King, Junior knew how to step up.<eos> I may be a newbie to snowboarding, but the way you're treating her, it's not right.<eos> There's no difference between boarders and skiers.<eos> We're all just people with wood strapped to our feet, sliding down a mountain.<eos> I have a dream that one day we will not be judged by the size of our board, but by what we do in the pow-pow.<eos> Because the snow doesn't care who we are.<eos> It does not.
I need to check out "Scandal."<eos> Oh, and I also need to fix things with Bow.<eos> I knew just what I had to do.<eos> - Dre. - Hmm?<eos> What are we doing in this neighborhood?<eos> Please tell me you are not gonna buy me another fake purse.<eos> I've never bought you a fake purse.<eos> - Dre. - Hmm?<eos> You know that "Chanel" has one "N," right?<eos> - I do now. - Mm-hmm.
Sit down, grandpa.<eos> There aren't enough Savitris to go around.<eos> And so many men competing for them.<eos> Please, kid.<eos> Please tell me where your house is.<eos> Please, kid.<eos> You want this watch?<eos> Yes?<eos> Doesn't this blink?<eos> Even my damned shoes do.
Dad, I think maybe I should go stay with Mom just until the baby's here.<eos> If you want to go stay with George, I'll understand.<eos> I just thought maybe we could, you know, kind of come here and live the way people used to.<eos> Like... a hundred billion years ago they didn't have fucking houses or cars or anything.<eos> This is the way they did it. They fucking lived in barns.<eos> How long would we be here for?<eos> Just for tonight, I promise.<eos> A week or two, tops.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - I don't.
If the light stayed green, he would not stop at the clinic to see Connie and to get tranquilizers.<eos> He would not turn left but go straight and stay straight.<eos> Learn to drive, jerk!<eos> I really like this.<eos> I don't want it to stop.<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah. - Hmm.<eos> I just want to sit here till it's over.<eos> I've listened to this about 500 times, and every time, it's like it's so slow, I feel like it could stop.<eos> But it doesn't.
Oh. Thank you.<eos> I'll give you a penny a pic if you go around and get some shots of all this.<eos> All right, yeah.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Free, for your birthday.<eos> There's the birthday boy.<eos> Hey, Carlos.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - How you doing?
Turns out he's actually pretty smart.<eos> - So are you serious about him?<eos> - I would be.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something's off.<eos> There's always something off, isn't there?<eos> What, you think he's shagging the head writer to get more scenes?<eos> That's how it started.<eos> No, I think it's just that I really like him.<eos> Oh, you do.
You know what, Hugo?<eos> People should never ever let their feelings get out of control.<eos> Yeah, for example, when you were struck out in the game, yeah, normally that's when another player is allowed to...<eos> Harry, I explained the rules to him.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - Yeah, that's not your place.<eos> I don't think Harry is trying...<eos> Let him speak for himself.<eos> I had no right to hit you, Hugo.<eos> - No, you didn't.
- I was making a point.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Bear, where are you?<eos> Bear!<eos> Stop it!<eos> What are you?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> - You want to leave me.<eos> - No, I don't.
That was not good.<eos> Look - we're friends;<eos> friends look out for each other.<eos> I don't want to do that again.<eos> - You sound like her.<eos> - Alice...?<eos> She left me.<eos> She never understood.<eos> - Help me understand.<eos> - You already do.
No wonder you want to protect him.<eos> I'm not protecting anyone.<eos> I've moved on.<eos> You're so annoyingly perfect for each other.<eos> She's never gonna trust me again - ever.<eos> - We're leaving.<eos> - Sam, we have to go.<eos> Uh, yeah!<eos> - How do we know Alice isn't here?<eos> - We don't.
Come on, magical altar thingummy. Where are you?<eos> - This place is massive.<eos> - Could be anywhere.<eos> How about it, Oscar?<eos> Got any more magical-altar vibes?<eos> I'm not getting anything.<eos> You wouldn't do anything stupid, would you?<eos> Based on recent experience?<eos> I know how badly you want to get Andy back.<eos> We all do.
And we are achieving.<eos> You return to consciousness, and be back with us.<eos> It's better this way, Adam.<eos> Do not you see?<eos> - You never again be alone.<eos> - No no.<eos> We know how this ends. We are one.<eos> We all want the same thing.<eos> - It is important that you do not feel sad.<eos> - Where does this conversation?
I've gotta be honest, I'm kind of massively regretting my decision to sizzle fajitas two inches from my head.<eos> But I'm glad I wore my awesome new shirt.<eos> It's like a smiley face.<eos> It... kind of like a smiley face.<eos> - It is!<eos> - Look at that.<eos> My plan is working.<eos> Get you over here, hide the A/C, get those clothes off.<eos> You don't actually have an air conditioner, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
Not a day goes by that I don't wish your mother was here so she could see what a wonderful woman you've become.<eos> - Are you freaking out, too?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I can't believe I married someone with a family member named Pootie.<eos> That's not why I'm freaking out.<eos> I-I just feel like everyone is abandoning me.<eos> Ellie, Andy, Tom, and now dad?<eos> Why are you smiling?<eos> Jules, you know how I love having all your friends and family at our house all the time.<eos> - No, you don't.
You're my best friend.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> And what's this about worst birthday ever?<eos> I mean, your birthday doesn't officially start until 11:48 PM, which it happens to be right now.<eos> Hey, Tom, hit it. ♪ oh, who-o-o-a ♪ ♪ who-o-o-o-a ♪<eos> There's nothing wrong with Stan's school.<eos> She'd never let me move.<eos> Who's gonna invest in a broken-down ambulance that serves wine? Hey. Oh, come on, babe, you know it's true.<eos> Junebug, we don't have a cousin named Pootie.<eos> No one does.
Truman...<eos> How did the Russians treat you?<eos> Badly, can't you see he's swollen, his breath stinks,<eos> I don't know what they gave him.<eos> You have breakfast here often?<eos> No, I'm with another candidate, she's in the restroom.<eos> She might adopt him. She phoned this morning, you were snoring.<eos> It's good to have more options.<eos> Since the Russian doesn't want him.<eos> - He doesn't?
And everyone talks about how kind he was.<eos> He was kind to a fault.<eos> He'd stand as guarantor for his friends' debts and end up on the hook for them.<eos> He'd be a shoulder for women and they'd quickly become a thing.<eos> Youko-san resembles our mom a bit, doesn't she?<eos> She stayed with him right to the end, though.<eos> We should be thankful to her.<eos> You're right.<eos> She probably didn't visit the hospital very much.<eos> Barely 10 minutes if she did.
They know I don't need two secretaries.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really thought he'd be back by now.<eos> Well, I hope he's in a better place.<eos> He's not dead.<eos> Stop saying that.<eos> There are a lot of better places than here.<eos> I'll give you the recommendation he would have.<eos> I know you'll land on your feet.<eos> I always do.
Is that all you heard?<eos> You're cheating yourself.<eos> That tiny apartment.<eos> I don't want to make plans, but we could get a place in the mountains or the country, or a place in the mountains and the country.<eos> Have you been looking for a place?<eos> It's a hobby.<eos> I mean, I guess what I'm trying to say is I want you to let yourself have a future with me.<eos> Do you want to get married?<eos> Sure.<eos> If you do.
Oh, look, I'm a mess!<eos> Oh my God, don't be ridiculous!<eos> Look at those lashes!<eos> You're gorgeous!<eos> Oh, yeah, look at my face.<eos> Oh, I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> You need a nice massage.<eos> Oh, God, I really don't, Donna...<eos> Yes, you do!
A good soldier never deserts on a mission and this mission is not over.<eos> What exactly is the mission, bud?<eos> If you don't know, I can't tell you. You drunken sot.<eos> Ricky, aren't you afraid someone's going to find all these weeds plants out here?<eos> No one's going to be out this fucking way any time soon.<eos> This is where people say they saw the Saskatchawaunch.<eos> Wait, they said they saw that around here?<eos> Dumb people did. It's probably a stupid bear or a dumb gorillna.<eos> Saskatchawaunches don't exist.<eos> Yeah, but what if they do?
Nipple placement.<eos> It's everything.<eos> Right now they're not where you expect them.<eos> It's disorientating.<eos> Went through the same thing with my own...<eos> These fucking breasts are too big!<eos> We can take them down a cup.<eos> I want my old ones back.<eos> No, you don't want that.<eos> Yes, I do.
so I said the same...table...<eos> Dad, in the middle of my... hey you better have not put salt in my food...<eos> Well hovv could I?<eos> you hid it again today<eos> ..open a new packet<eos> Greasing is good for motion..<eos> Dad stop being so..difficult from last two days not a single piece has come out..!<eos> I don't want to die of constipation!<eos> no one dies of constipation.<eos> Elvis Presley did..
No sign! No, we're using the sign, because the sign's a big part of the plan.<eos> What is the plan?<eos> What is happening?<eos> Charlie, we found a loophole in the system.<eos> Yeah, it's a closing loophole; it involves airline miles and points.<eos> You're doing a chicken and airline miles scam today?<eos> Look, it is a great plan, okay?<eos> We do not have a ton of time to explain it to you, we're busy...<eos> Okay, fine, whatever, I get it, I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
I want to stay here!<eos> What are you going to do about it?<eos> Go home, or I'll tell the Colonel everything<eos> Go Ana<eos> With Piolho here I can deal with<eos> Now, let's have a little conversation we should've had a long time ago<eos> What do you want , Piolho?<eos> Why are you always getting in our way?<eos> We love each other, and you have nothing to do with it<eos> Yes I do!
So, Murphy,<eos> What are you doing in Paris?<eos> I'm a filmmaker.<eos> Oh. He's studying.<eos> I'm studying, still yeah.<eos> Hmm-mm. So your an artist?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Like my daughter.<eos> Mama likes art.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Dad!<eos> Dad, no!<eos> No!<eos> - Dad!<eos> No!<eos> Dad!<eos> - John.<eos> You wanna talk?<eos> Danny told me he asked to come home.<eos> He did?
Tell Jane and Lisbon we're ready.<eos> Yep.<eos> That was Wylie.<eos> They're all set.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, yeah, I'm ready.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your brothers don't hate you, you know.<eos> Yeah, they do.
I hear it's big.<eos> Huge.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How's the tea?<eos> Hot.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
I get tired but I'm okay.<eos> There's something different about you from the last time we talked.<eos> You look lighter... less conflicted.<eos> Number three -- you saw it, found an answer, huh?<eos> The number three is incredibly common, Gabriel.<eos> We see it everywhere.<eos> Red clay -- a little rarer.<eos> But, uh, not much.<eos> I didn't want to be right.<eos> Of course you did.
They found nothing.<eos> Which is good news.<eos> I thought it was going to be good news if they found an environmental toxin inside him.<eos> Then he could be treated.<eos> I thought that was good news.<eos> Well, it's good that he hasn't been poisoned.<eos> So the chemicals, the toxins that they found inside the bear...<eos> - Jules.<eos> - they didn't find those inside my son?<eos> - No, they didn't...
May I see Miss Angelique?<eos> But of course.<eos> Come this way, please.<eos> - I trust you shan't be disappointed.<eos> - I'm sure not.<eos> Be firm with her.<eos> She is wilful.<eos> Like all children.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
Lupus Dei.<eos> He shall be your challenge, daughter.<eos> I want to know who did this to you.<eos> Get better, Mr. Roper.<eos> We have much to talk about.<eos> My name is Dorian Gray.<eos> Angelique.<eos> This is where I work.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
Aren't you all dying to know?<eos> It's a story.<eos> A narrative that continues.<eos> Language to language.<eos> Greek to Latin to Sumerian to Arabic to 10 other obscure languages and pictographs, changing language from relic to relic.<eos> Is it the story of Lucifer, then?<eos> The angel cast out by God?<eos> Time will tell.<eos> How could this one monk know all these languages?<eos> - He didn't.
Father's murderers.<eos> All those figures screaming in his new crime scenes.<eos> Ah, Mr. Clare... it hurts me to create them.<eos> Like I'm bringing them to life and then torturing them.<eos> Like some sort of terrible African voodoo doll.<eos> They're all fresh when they come out of the molds... and then I make them suffer.<eos> Some people think that's what life is.<eos> Born fresh to suffer.<eos> Do you think that?<eos> Uh... I did.
Go on, my dear.<eos> "He took us by our winged backs and raised us over His head.<eos> Thence did he fling us from his Heavenly Throne and... and cast us down, to Earth and to Hell.<eos> So we were..."<eos> Damned?<eos> At the very least.<eos> I'm sorry, this is a fascinating narrative... but I don't see it's much help to us.<eos> It's the hidden language of the demon.<eos> It must have a purpose.<eos> Not everything does.
Is that what you're gonna do?<eos> You do that and you won't be able to stop.<eos> So stop now!<eos> I'll stop when his soul is burning, like hers was.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> Do what you fucking want.<eos> I hope you can live with it, because I sure as hell can't.<eos> And don't worry. I see you for exactly what you are.<eos> LILY: Don't you want me to have friends?<eos> Of course I do.
But I guess you know that.<eos> Do you feel better now?<eos> Now that you're a murderess?<eos> I suppose that's what you learned here, isn't it?<eos> From your nice old lady friend.<eos> How to kill babies.<eos> How to kill men?<eos> You do belong here.<eos> I know what I've done.<eos> Do you?
There have been whispers about Coca-Cola.<eos> No need to impress me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Not here.<eos> This will just take a moment, Sarah.<eos> You can't be in here.<eos> Everyone's going to think I'm looking for a job.<eos> You mind?<eos> They should always think you're unhappy. You're wrong.<eos> And for the first time, they don't.
I'm not ignoring the fact that I could actually lose your love.<eos> You never lost it.<eos> But I will never allow you to hurt me again.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I always have.<eos> I've never loved anyone else.<eos> Never.<eos> You think you can come in here when I'm all disoriented and say the things I wanted you to say to me two years ago and make me run away with you?<eos> I said it to you 10 years ago and I'll say it again.<eos> I do.
- Tell you what.<eos> It's been long enough.<eos> What do you say we consummate our relationship... - tonight? - [Breathing heavily]<eos> Huh? Let's do it.<eos> [Chuckles] And the last card is played.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Shh! This is a library.<eos> Do you see what's happening here?<eos> Ron, I need that crotch-blinder.<eos> No, you don't.
This was all for nothing.<eos> I thought it was very big of you to not bend when Tammy promised you the vote.<eos> Well, I thought it was very big of you to help him at all.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Okay, back to work to figure out how to destroy you.<eos> Same.<eos> Good bye.<eos> Dude, thank you so much for this.<eos> I really owe you one.<eos> No, you don't.
All:<eos> Trick or treat!<eos> Oh! Look at them!<eos> Here you go, you little monsters.<eos> I love this. You guys are the best.<eos> [door closes] My love, we have to go.<eos> Just put all the candy in a bowl or something.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - Did you eat all the candy?<eos> - No. - Did you?
Shaming me.<eos> Gaia, don't suck your teeth, yeah?<eos> Thanks!<eos> Love you, too!<eos> Oi, look, it's the deputy head.<eos> Oh, God! Look!<eos> Look at them.<eos> ~ Ignore them, Colin.<eos> ~ I've got no authority left.<eos> You do, natural authority.
No.<eos> Reckon I might jack it for good.<eos> ~ Oi! You're not going to do that.<eos> ~ Why aren't I?<eos> I want you to finish school. Up!<eos> You can do one exam.<eos> Ah...<eos> Maths.<eos> Tell them you want to sit maths.<eos> But I don't.
Basic nonsense.<eos> Then you said, "Everything that just came out of your mouth "is basic nonsense.<eos> "Good day." And that was it.<eos> No, that was not it.<eos> After I said you were full of it, you got very angry and scrunched up your face and said, "Excuse me, sir, but I disagree."<eos> Did you let me have it?<eos> That was one of your top-10 tirades, I'd say.<eos> You were pounding your fist and shaking.<eos> You called me a heartless thug.<eos> I most certainly did not.
It's gonna drive my ex-wife crazy.<eos> So far, so good, but, uh, in the words of Jerry Maguire- "The human head weighs 8 pounds."<eos> No. "Show me the money."<eos> Andy, do you know how lucky you are to work here?<eos> I'm a kingmaker.<eos> Pep Wiley, Chuck Warschank, Selena Gomez--I made them.<eos> You discovered Selena Gomez?<eos> Different Selena Gomez.<eos> Look, I don't have the money for a raise.<eos> Uh, yeah you do.
- April...<eos> - Well, it is simple, Leslie.<eos> In today's fast-paced society, national parks are still the best place for full moon werewolf transformations.<eos> I know you're kidding.<eos> But I also know that you're prepared and we are going to do great.<eos> How psyched are you about this trip?<eos> April, are you super psyched?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Also you have lipstick on your teeth.<eos> I do?
- You don't have one.<eos> You're like Prince.<eos> - When's my birthday?<eos> - A few thousand years ago.<eos> - Where was I born?<eos> - Give me a second.<eos> Great job, champ.<eos> Okay, guys, stop picking on him.<eos> Jules, he doesn't know anything about you, either.<eos> Yes, he does.
See?<eos> You find people as annoying as I do.<eos> - More so.<eos> - And yet, you're able to listen to them. How do you do it?<eos> It's not easy.<eos> I have a few tricks up my sleeve.<eos> Like if someone's droning on about their stupid life,<eos> I just pretend something really horrible will happen to my child if I don't listen.<eos> That's not gonna work for you 'cause you don't have a child.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Okay, let's make this a great night.<eos> I really think my dad's in love with Diane.<eos> Hi, everybody.<eos> This is Betty.<eos> - It's so nice to meet you, Di--<eos> - Betty.<eos> Di-Betty, I mean, diabetes...<eos> Which I hope you don't have.<eos> I-I made pie.<eos> Well, no, I don't.
I've seen the way you hold him.<eos> And even when you go out and you get a little crazy, the thing you're gonna be most excited about is to get home and see your son.<eos> All my mom ever wanted to do at the end of the night was go to an airport hotel and see if any hair bands were staying there.<eos> She once took her top off in a hot tub and caused a fistfight between Kip Winger and the lead singer of Quiet Riot.<eos> Please don't tell me that you--<eos> Poolside in her purse.<eos> If I close my eyes, I can still hear them arguing.<eos> My God, she was not a great mom.<eos> It sounded like she had great boobs, though.<eos> - She did. - Mm.
I don't know.<eos> Rap is really hard.<eos> Seeing my dad look lonely makes me realize how good people are in pairs.<eos> Feels like I'm about to hear your latest, totally unnecessary obsession.<eos> My dad needs a best buddy.<eos> And there it is.<eos> Look, Jules, not everybody needs to have people around<eos> - all the time.<eos> - Yes, they do.<eos> Everyone does, except for maybe serial killers.
Who was that?<eos> - Someone I met once.<eos> - Cute.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's your pager, dumbo.<eos> I can't...<eos> It's Sean.<eos> He wants you to meet him.<eos> He says you know where?<eos> I do.
I am pregnant, I just thought you should know.<eos> You are sixteen, Faith.<eos> Who is the boy?<eos> - Are you going to tell him?<eos> - No. I am recovering from a serious illness, Faith.<eos> What if it comes back?<eos> What if I die?<eos> - That will not happen.<eos> - You do not know that.<eos> I do.
They're all anagrams.<eos> For Charles DiLaurentis.<eos> Some of those toys in Ali's room were hers but some of them were his.<eos> I feel like they grew up together.<eos> If I'm right, everything that matters most to Charles is in this vault.<eos> If we get in, we can use what's inside to bargain our way out.<eos> But Mona said we won't make it to the vault before the power comes on.<eos> Okay, if I'm right, this is as far as we need to go.<eos> I counted the steps to the vault from the prom room.<eos> - Of course you did.
[Boy] They say the last thing she cried out As they put the noose around her neck, Was a curse on all the children of the land.<eos> Don't they usually burn witches?<eos> She wasn't like any other witch.<eos> She wouldn't drown.<eos> She wouldn't burn.<eos> It took nine hours before she finally died.<eos> They took her down and cut up her body And placed it in nine unmarked graves.<eos> My granddad says witches don't exist.<eos> Of course they do.
It's good, yo.<eos> I know this nigga.<eos> We got business to discuss.<eos> Without the audience, qdubs.<eos> Y'all good.<eos> Rolla got killed doing some "i don't need niggas with me all the time" shit.<eos> I'm not the one.<eos> Streets don't got no idea who pulled the trigger on him.<eos> Cops don't know shit.<eos> But they never do.
He didn't exactly have a glittering career.<eos> ~ Sir Hugo?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> It came with the house.<eos> It's the anniversary of his death tomorrow.<eos> You obviously know a lot more about the old chap than I do.<eos> The date is on his grave.<eos> Mr Bainbridge says that you're very interested in paganism.<eos> He thinks you have big plans of your own to mark the day.<eos> I did.
It's very sad.<eos> This country never gave any recognition to its mixed-martial arts fighters as sportsmen.<eos> They never got the respect they deserved.<eos> Maybe even the government is afraid of setting the Indian fighters free.<eos> But now the entire world's going to hear about the Right 2 Fight!<eos> That is R2F!<eos> Come on, Gary.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Mr. Briganza, do you think we have world class fighters?<eos> Of course, we do.
Monty!<eos> Monty.<eos> Gary, look at what your sons are doing?<eos> - Relax.<eos> - I broke his shoulder.<eos> I heard it myself.<eos> Get up, son..<eos> Careful..<eos> I heard it myself. His shoulder's broken.<eos> So you did.
Pero listen to you.<eos> Don't you talk to him that way.<eos> That's right.<eos> So you gotta listen to what I say because otherwise, there'll be behavioral consequences.<eos> Man, when you put 'em in the microwave, they get disgusting!<eos> I'm not eating 'em.<eos> Hey, now! Hey! Whoa.<eos> Margarita brought you French fries.<eos> You better get fuckin' hungry real quick.<eos> Emiliano, do me a favor.
- No.<eos> A person only gets married once or twice in her life, so go big or go really big.<eos> Yeah, and it's not just about you.<eos> - It's about all your family and friends. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - I love a wedding party.<eos> - I know.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Yeah, what makes you think she wants you there?<eos> Ay, Dios. What do you mean?<eos> Of course she does.
Not so good, actually.<eos> Not so good.<eos> Remember what I said about a corpse being a corpse.<eos> I just want this corpse to be sleeping in the same bed with me, that's all.<eos> I feel the language gap is still a problem.<eos> Healy...<eos> I can't be your marriage counselor.<eos> Translator... for an hour or so, tonight, after dinner.<eos> - Oh, no, I think I have plans.<eos> - No, you don't.
You crossed a line!<eos> I did?<eos> Yes!<eos> Do you think that this is what I want?<eos> To be here in this, um...<eos> In this grocery store? Mmm. I'm sorry I sold you the fruit.<eos> And, yes, fine.<eos> I will admit it.<eos> I knew it was bad.<eos> I did.
I could've been killed.<eos> I was hangin' out with her.<eos> You can't trust her.<eos> No, i can't trust you.<eos> You paid her to leave.<eos> She's trouble, man.<eos> Just like kanan was trouble back in the day?<eos> Like i was trouble when i wouldn't help you kill lobos?<eos> You think i'm fuckin' stupid, don't you?<eos> Just like kanan did.
It's nice to go to a diner, too, you know?<eos> Like, I like diners. Yes.<eos> I appreciate a menu with pictures.<eos> It makes it easier.<eos> It's like sometimes those guys make me do things that aren't really me, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like, okay, like, I kind of feel compelled to call you a bird right now and throw my glass of water in your face.<eos> Right.<eos> But, uh, you know, I'm realizing that I only do that stuff 'cause I don't want the guys to do it to me first, you know what I mean?<eos> Of course I do.
Of what?<eos> Ever since father died...<eos> A small dark part of me has blamed you for his death.<eos> When they told me what happened at Fort William, that Randall flogged ye himself, and that seeing that is what killed father, I thought you must have done something to bring it upon yerself.<eos> Shot yer mouth off, or acted without thinking of the consequences, as ye have done all yer life.<eos> But then out at the mill pond, when I saw the scars on yer back, scars made by a lash laid down wi' such fury... you dinna fash yerself about it anymore.<eos> It was me.<eos> It's my fault that Randall beat ye so.<eos> You dinna ken what you're saying.<eos> But I do.
I messed it up.<eos> I messed this up.<eos> How?<eos> I messed this whole thing up.<eos> I-I should have been on this faster.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You put I.A. on it.<eos> And now my best friend is the guy on their suspect list.<eos> Nobody is gonna believe that Oliver's corrupt.<eos> - We don't... - Okay?
I didn't...<eos> I didn't want to hurt anybody.<eos> I was gonna come cl... come clean after.<eos> But then... then I found out what Alonso did to Ted, and this just...<eos> Alonso killed Ted McDonald?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, listen, you need to think this through.<eos> Think what through?<eos> You want to save Oliver, right?<eos> Of course I do.
Ms. Peck...<eos> Yeah?<eos> ...You're dismissed for the time being.<eos> [ door opens ] Dad, what happened?<eos> Bill:<eos> He confessed. He took a plea deal.<eos> He's gonna testify against commissioner santana And aidan kelly for a slap on the wrist.<eos> S-so, that's -- that's good.<eos> You think that's good, gail?<eos> Do you?
Excuse me. Can you go any faster?<eos> I'm gonna miss my plane.<eos> [ sighs, clears throat ] [ siren wails, chirps ] Oh. Seriously?<eos> Unreal.<eos> [ knock on window ] Hi.<eos> Your phone's off.<eos> I know. I was in court.<eos> What are -- is everything okay?<eos> Nick, how did you know that this was my car?<eos> I didn't.
Captain. Meet the newest credentialed journalist with the LAPD.<eos> For the next 48 hours.<eos> Oh, is that what you wanted to talk to me about?<eos> No, um... c-can I steal you for a second? - Can I... is that okay?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Hi, I'm supposed to give this to you.<eos> Hi, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you're already writing another one, they must have really liked your first story.<eos> Oh, they didn't.
I got a tax guy.<eos> In a former life, I was VP at Alpha Managers.<eos> No doubt you're familiar with our Texas branch. I think we were number three in the area.<eos> I'm Jim Adams.<eos> Jacob Masterson.<eos> Call me Big Jake.<eos> All right, well, tax codes can be a bit tricky around here, Big Jake.<eos> See, once a business hits a 250K threshold, municipality and state taxes can run up to 15%.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> - Yeah, not a lot of people do.
Hey.<eos> Annabeth:... It's too much pressure.<eos> I need a cruller.<eos> I need a cruller.<eos> You expecting someone?<eos> No, I'm just enjoying my pancake and hoping there isn't a fire.<eos> Oh, very funny.<eos> Hey, look, Zoe, I'm here for you.<eos> I mean, I know what's going on.<eos> You do?
You and your fucking group!<eos> You only came so you had a place to rehearse.<eos> - And?<eos> - Enough Daniel!<eos> Go to your room! You too, Roman!<eos> Last month you had dreadlocks, now you're a punk!<eos> Stupid pest!<eos> Why do you always befriend weirdos?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
So, dad, I fed your cats while you were in the hospital.<eos> - They're grateful, I'm sure.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And... when I went over there the first time, I went in your office.<eos> So, uh...<eos> Well, okay.<eos> So...<eos> A-after your mother died,<eos> I got to feelin' pretty low.<eos> We all did.
Aye, Jenny hides the good stuff away when we come,<eos> Along with Ian's fine tobacco.<eos> Do you blame me?<eos> You're a quiet one. Where are you from, MacTavish?<eos> Na h-innse gall.<eos> Aye, you don't sound like an islander.<eos> Well, Jamie spent time in France Fighting with the French army with Ian.<eos> Perhaps that's what's influenced his accent.<eos> Did you, now?<eos> I did some soldiering myself with the French in Austria.
Didn't hear you come in.<eos> Yeah, it was late, and I didn't want to wake you.<eos> What did Cornell want this time?<eos> Just...<eos> More questions, and...<eos> I didn't tell you that I went down to the station earlier 'cause I didn't want you to worry.<eos> Little late for that.<eos> Why does she keep wanting to talk to you?<eos> I mean, she can't seriously think...<eos> She does.
!<eos> Scott is dangerous!<eos> You are so wrong!<eos> He's a really good guy.<eos> Nat, are you...<eos> What's going on?<eos> His own wife said he's violent and unstable.<eos> You... you... you have to stay away from him.<eos> I don't have to do anything you say.<eos> - Yes, you do!
Scott is dangerous!<eos> You are so wrong!<eos> He's a really good guy.<eos> Nat, are you...<eos> What's going on?<eos> His own wife said he's violent and unstable.<eos> You... you... you have to stay away from him.<eos> I don't have to do anything you say.<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!
Don't you dare lie to me!<eos> He killed those people, he knew there would be terrible consequences.<eos> To save our daughter's life.<eos> What would you have done for your son?<eos> No-one gave me that choice.<eos> If they had, you would have done the same thing.<eos> Tell me that isn't true.<eos> Somebody has to take the blame for this.<eos> But, Philip, it doesn't have to be Robin.<eos> No, no, it doesn't.
- Some kind of code.<eos> - And?<eos> And...<eos> Li-Na needed some kid, some egghead, to try and crack it.<eos> Do you know what this kid looks like?<eos> All the details you need.<eos> Ivan has been very co-operative.<eos> Please... I am begging you... man-to-man, don't leave me with her. You have no idea what she is going<eos> - to do to me.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
With this, all of it.<eos> So, what about Li-Na? Huh?<eos> - Well, intel has her in Paris.<eos> - Oh, come on, boss.<eos> - Do you believe that?<eos> - Michael...<eos> It's called the chain of command.<eos> You obey the person above you without question.<eos> - You believe that?<eos> - No, I don't.
- Well, trapped is a strong word.<eos> Ears, ears, ears.<eos> Yeah, we're trapped.<eos> What's wrong with these things?<eos> - Scott.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> It's the cameras.<eos> There's cameras all over the place.<eos> What, you think they're locking us in?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm touched.<eos> - Weapons down!<eos> Get in!<eos> Les anglais.<eos> What did she say, Julia?<eos> Her final words, what were they?<eos> She said that you would come for me.<eos> There would be nowhere I could hide.<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> No, she didn't.
Oh, my God!<eos> Jesus!<eos> Come on, put your dick away.<eos> Let's go eat, 'cause we're not "this" anymore.<eos> This is not-- No.<eos> I love this place.<eos> I love, like, old, Italian-y places.<eos> If you, uh, go in the bathroom, there's a gun behind the toilet.<eos> Do you wanna have a sleepover tonight?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
I don't know.<eos> I really don't.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> I mean, come on, Richard.<eos> You never believe anything I say, so why do you ever ask me anything?<eos> Maybe it's because I'm an honest person and I expect others to be honest.<eos> Ha!<eos> Beware of the man who declares himself honest.<eos> I thought you cared about me.<eos> I do.
I really don't.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> I mean, come on, Richard.<eos> You never believe anything I say, so why do you ever ask me anything?<eos> Maybe it's because I'm an honest person and I expect others to be honest.<eos> Ha!<eos> Beware of the man who declares himself honest.<eos> I thought you cared about me.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
Yeah.<eos> It's... a 1960s thing with a...<eos> Did you know that this play was banned in Russia and in Israel?<eos> Did you know that after he wrote it,<eos> Shelby thought about killing himself?<eos> Did you know that he rewrote the ending 'cause he was afraid that it would cause other depressed people to kill themselves?<eos> Don't you wonder what that original ending was?<eos> But you missed the one th--<eos> When the kid said at thing, you missed it.<eos> No, I didn't.
Are you trying to turn me on right now?<eos> Why, are--<eos> Are you-- Are you, um--<eos> Are you being that?<eos> Well, I'm not saying, but I may be interested in what you right now may be wearing.<eos> I'm, uh...<eos> I'm wearing jeans and a T-shirt.<eos> Well, take your pants off, then.<eos> You want me to?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You never liked me.<eos> That was always clear.<eos> Because guys like you, you're always looking for that climb.<eos> I was a good agent, Alex.<eos> But that wasn't good enough for you.<eos> Well, I wasn't after your job, if that's what you thought.<eos> I wasn't worried about you taking my job.<eos> Then what?<eos> You knew how shaky things were at home for her.<eos> We all did.
I'll bet you'd have an ankle holster, wouldn't you?<eos> You know, that's cute. What else?<eos> Wow, now, that's impressive.<eos> So many guns, I don't know which one to use.<eos> How about you?<eos> You want one?<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - But we need three guys.<eos> - No. No, we don't.
Launch the doomsday device.<eos> Game over.<eos> If working with me is what you really want, right, Chuck?<eos> You called him.<eos> You called Hamlin.<eos> I always turn my phone off before I put it in your mailbox.<eos> Two nights ago, it was left on.<eos> Battery drained.<eos> I was so damn sure that I turned it off, you know.<eos> Because I always do.
Henry, your father...<eos> My father is dead.<eos> So is his dream.<eos> Mr. Habershorn, if you're interested, I'd be willing to sell you back your land at the full price to do with what you wish.<eos> I've received a letter of interest from the Mount Sinai people.<eos> I suppose I'll have no choice but to sell to them.<eos> That's sure to lose me some friends on the Upper East Side.<eos> But what's to become of this place?<eos> I don't want to tell you your business, Henry, but I feel I owe it to your father to provide my wise counsel at this time.<eos> No, you don't.
- Thank you.<eos> - After you.<eos> So... we start over.<eos> As though we meet for the first time. Hm?<eos> Please.<eos> - Promise him a prison.<eos> - A prison?<eos> A brand new federal corrections facility.<eos> Why would his constituents want convicts in their backyard?<eos> They don't.
I'm sure they loved you.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's just, before the divorce, they were perfect, and then... afterwards, they were just human.<eos> And I hated them.<eos> Man, I really hated them.<eos> It took me years to realize that that doesn't make... them any less.<eos> It actually made them more, because we're human beings, and we all make mistakes.<eos> You know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I love you.<eos> Wow, I uh--<eos> You don't have to say anything yet.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know you feel the same.<eos> Um...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> How do you know?<eos> How do I know?<eos> I just do.
Is that understood?<eos> Sir?<eos> Why don't you follow the Viceroy and punch him squarely in the face?<eos> I mean, you seem so determined to end your career, there's absolutely no point in dragging it out.<eos> Jaya's dead.<eos> What?<eos> Dead?<eos> The police just showed me her body.<eos> I said I didn't know who she was.<eos> In many ways I didn't, really.
Don't question anything, don't challenge anything.<eos> Play your part, Ian.<eos> It's the only way to survive.<eos> Are your parents living?<eos> I have lost both my parents.<eos> To lose one parent, Mr Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune.<eos> To lose both looks like carelessness!<eos> Yes?<eos> ~ Ah, Mr McLeod. So, you've seen him, then?<eos> ~ I did.
I've saved you the trouble.<eos> Leave us.<eos> It's disappointing, Ian.<eos> I can't lie to you.<eos> Telling the truth?<eos> Giving an innocent man an alibi is disappointing?<eos> Because he is innocent, Ralph.<eos> Ramu didn't kill that woman.<eos> I feel sorry for you.<eos> Really, I do.
~ I'm calling it Don't Go.<eos> ~ Mmm. It's my brilliant plan.<eos> ~ See, you don't get to catch your train till the music ends.<eos> ~ Oh! You got me.<eos> That was a mean thing to do.<eos> Anyway, who ever heard of an American in India?<eos> Look - I'll build you a Taj Mahal.<eos> A palace.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> No, you don't.
- I'm a grown-up.<eos> - I'm pregnant.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Maybe.<eos> - Well, you're getting an abortion tomorrow.<eos> - No. - Yes.<eos> - I love him.<eos> - You don't.
Layla!<eos> I've got a small problem, and I'm gonna need your help handling it.<eos> Hey, Buck.<eos> Hey. How you doing?<eos> Not great.<eos> I just called off our wedding.<eos> - Yeah, I heard.<eos> - You did?<eos> How did you hear?<eos> I just did it.
Micah.<eos> Well, you take care of you and your sister, all right?<eos> I love you.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Well, at least she took your call this time.<eos> That's an improvement.<eos> Yeah, well, I guess she saw the video of Deacon and Luke fighting.<eos> Gives her something else to be mad at me about.<eos> Speaking of Deacon, I probably should tell you that he came by today.<eos> He did?
Uh, wait.<eos> I've got one more thing for him.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hey.<eos> So, I just spoke with the chief of police.<eos> Layla took full responsibility for her actions.<eos> No charges are being filed.<eos> She didn't say where she got the pills?<eos> Says she brought them from home.<eos> She did?
- Beverly, she... Was... She...<eos> Oh, my God. I should've known the two of you don't give a damn about mending fences!<eos> The answer is no.<eos> Mama, would you listen for just a minute?<eos> You lied to me, Scarlett, so I don't know why I would listen to a thing you say.<eos> I didn't lie to you.<eos> I just couldn't tell you everything.<eos> I didn't know how.<eos> I do wanna fix us as a family.<eos> I really do.

And I got it bad, all right?<eos> I got it real bad.<eos> Fact is, I got me a daughter who says she hates not seeing me, and she's about to get a whole lot of that.<eos> - No...<eos> - And I'm not gonna see her either, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna see her cut her first record or walk down the aisle.<eos> I might not even see her finish this school year, all right?<eos> - You don't know any of that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> - I do, Scarlett.
Right.<eos> Um, let me guess.<eos> You're dropping me from the label?<eos> - I want you to play for him.<eos> I want you to show him what you showed me<eos> - in that jam tent at the festival.<eos> - Why?<eos> Is this because of me and my music, or is it because you feel guilty about what happened at the... party?<eos> I mean, does it matter?<eos> It does to me.
I don't have time to fight, Rayna.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Just wanted to let you know that my lawyers are preparing to file an emergency injunction against you tomorrow, stripping you of your parental rights, seeing as how Deacon is Maddie's biological father.<eos> You... you can't do this.<eos> I have no choice.<eos> I want that contract nullified.<eos> Yeah, but Maddie is my daughter.<eos> You think I want to explode our family?<eos> You think I want to break her heart into a million pieces?<eos> I do not.
Why are you so mad about this?<eos> Maybe because we're supposed to make these decisions together.<eos> Juliette, it's called being married!<eos> You know what, Avery?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> I have a song to go finish.<eos> Of all the boys in Nashville...<eos> I think he's a good kid, though,<eos> - and we know ours is.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
It's really not fair, you know? [Chuckles]<eos> I mean, I didn't get that on-the-job trainin' that most dads get.<eos> I wasn't there for your first skinned knee or... [inhales deeply]<eos> Day you come home from school crying' 'cause... somebody said something mean to ya.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> Much as we both hate this moment, I gotta admit, I love being here to have it with you.<eos> That was pretty perfect, Dad.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> So does this mean you're not gonna tell mom?<eos> No. No, it does not.
This was recovered from your house.<eos> My best mate.<eos> I loved him.<eos> Your wife says you purchased it from an antiques fair in France.<eos> Your honeymoon?<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> It never worked.<eos> With modified ammunition it works perfectly well.<eos> Easy, if you know what you're doing.<eos> And you do, Carl, don't you?
Stop.<eos> He disappeared out Solnavägen twenty minutes ago.<eos> I would like to expand the search area to Solna Vasastan.<eos> The suspect is a police uniform and is armed.<eos> Inform all devices.<eos> You can send out an identifying data and ask metro trains not to stop.<eos> He said it Also, there were flowers in hell.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> - I do not know.<eos> - I do.
We're here.<eos> Just tell us now.<eos> I got plans tonight.<eos> Uh, so change them.<eos> For a stupid announcement?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> It's news about your sister who you love.<eos> Think you can spare an hour?<eos> Gallaghers don't do announcements at dinner.<eos> We do blackouts, suicide attempts, but never announcements.
You certainly don't have time for any outside activities.<eos> Seriously?<eos> That's the best you could do?<eos> Yes.<eos> Unlike you, I have real work to do.<eos> This wouldn't have happened if you'd come to rehearsal.<eos> What the hell's going on out here? !<eos> He's putting on some kind of terrible play.<eos> Do you want to help plan this wedding or not?<eos> Of course I do.
I put it on your phone.<eos> You know the song about changing for the better?<eos> It'll change you... for the better.<eos> Babe, why is this so important to you?<eos> Because even though you don't like musicals and you never planned on liking musicals, I was hoping, if you met the right guy, maybe you'd change and say "yes" to him.<eos> About musicals.<eos> Honey...<eos> I love you, but I'm not that girl.<eos> Do you even know "I'm not that girl" is a song from "Wicked"?<eos> No, I do not.
Good.<eos> Because it's private.<eos> And by private, I mean...<eos> Spectacular.<eos> So, I finally took Harvard shopping because... He dresses like a lesbian librarian.<eos> No, because he refuses to spend money on himself.<eos> Wait till you see what I bought him.<eos> He has such a rugged sensuality.<eos> I mean, I don't have to tell you.<eos> No, you don't.
- I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do, or you wouldn't be drawing that symbol... a symbol you've seen before.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> That's it, isn't it?<eos> You've seen it before, but you can't remember where, right?<eos> Something like that.<eos> You've got the ring of the Magi!<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes, you do!
What's next?<eos> Land something huge.<eos> And then?<eos> Have a big idea.<eos> Create a catchphrase.<eos> So you want fame?<eos> Yes.<eos> What else?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Glen.<eos> I know something could happen to me.<eos> But I feel safe because I know you're mine.<eos> Glen, stop.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm married.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> You don't.
Let me take you to Bermuda.<eos> No.<eos> Cape Cod?<eos> I don't want to go anywhere I don't want to go.<eos> Don't make plans for me.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> I have a lot of work.<eos> Look, I know I told you not to complain, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear about it.<eos> But you really don't.
The movie you got Terrance.... It's going.<eos> And. For the love interest is... still wide open.<eos> They're looking for an urban unknown Marilyn Monroe type.<eos> - Kinds of sounds like...<eos> - Amaya!<eos> How do you know?<eos> They haven't released anything.<eos> Oh, because I'm a man.<eos> You really want to leave right now, don't you?<eos> I don't. But, yes.
Ball in.<eos> Damn, bro, you got to have better hands.<eos> You got to be able to catch.<eos> Come on, girl.<eos> Get up.<eos> Let me play some.<eos> Let me throw you the ball.<eos> No, I'm cool.<eos> You don't want me to throw you one?<eos> Yeah, hell, yeah, you don't.
- Four?<eos> What four? - Gwen...<eos> Gwen would want this.<eos> You don't know your own kids, but you know what a woman in a coma wants?<eos> There's us, Barb, and then there's you.<eos> How do you think that's gonna look to people?<eos> How do you think it's gonna look?<eos> People are already trying to blame the victim, blame our son. Do you care about that?<eos> Do you... do you care about that?<eos> No, of course you don't, b-because you never did.
And that's why I want to make you a better offer.<eos> Listen, I can't touch Dad's money until all the legal stuff is sorted.<eos> But once it is, I reckon I'll have enough to keep this place afloat.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think you're a godsend.<eos> I promise I'll pay you back every penny with interest.<eos> I'm not suggesting a loan.<eos> I want to be a partner.<eos> I want a say in how this place is run.<eos> You do?
She's like the sweet little sister I never had.<eos> Shelly, you've got a little sister.<eos> Yeah, but she's a bitch.<eos> Text me if you want to hang out after work.<eos> All right.<eos> [Chuckles] Bye, Danny.<eos> All right, man, look, I'm gonna tell you something that you've only heard once before, and it was that time you fell into the dolphin tank at the aquarium...<eos> Brace yourself.<eos> She wants to have sex with you.<eos> No, she doesn't.
You named the desk Trolltopia?<eos> That's so lame.<eos> Sorry, Excelsior.<eos> Where is my stuff?<eos> It's on your new desk.<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> That's the fart desk.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.
Carry on.<eos> Early stage Parkinson's?<eos> And the patient's cognitive decline is increasing rapidly, it's not looking good.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Who is Patient X anyway?<eos> No one.<eos> Bo, if this is about last night I am not in the mood.<eos> I'm here to question Jack.<eos> Oh, when you need his help it's okay.<eos> But when I do...
So whafs new?<eos> Nothing.<eos> The kids?<eos> I'm going to Max's.<eos> I'll probably be back late.<eos> Fine. I'll be asleep.<eos> Well then... I'll be going.<eos> - No buzzer?<eos> - I used it.<eos> - You did?
I have to admit I'm lucky on that level.<eos> Karine is pretty relaxing.<eos> She isn't at all suspicious. It never even crosses her mind.<eos> Good for you.<eos> You know me. I'm not like that.<eos> I follow my route.<eos> I'm not bragging.<eos> In all these years, ifs never been that tough.<eos> And, to be honest, the opportunity never arose.<eos> Bu! if it did...

No patients?
I need to... You're going too fast.<eos> - What do you suggest?<eos> - Not shopping him to the cops anyhow.<eos> even realize he's being arrested in that state.<eos> So they lock him up and we've done our duty? Great!<eos> Think I'm pleased?<eos> Half of what we do is done out of duty, not our of pleasure.<eos> We're talking about Simon! We can'! be so categorical.<eos> So he has mitigating circumstances?<eos> Of course he does!
It's not so much a place, more a circumstance.<eos> What's going to happen to him?<eos> Mussels will eat him.<eos> He can fuck off.<eos> We're gonna go to jail.<eos> If someone learns of this, we'll rot in a dungeon, forever.<eos> With rats, scorpios,<eos> - And rotten meat to eat!<eos> You got it, now?<eos> - Yes, I do.
If I had my way, I'd ban the stuff entirely.<eos> That's a bit extreme, isn't it?<eos> With all due respect, sir, I've seen the damage it causes.<eos> They must have got their drink from somewhere local.<eos> Illegally, no doubt.<eos> We'll find out.<eos> Henri.<eos> - I came to say I'm sorry about the window.<eos> - Oh, it doesn't matter.<eos> It does.
I know you don't want to be alone.<eos> I like you, Harry, but you can't just look to the closest person to fill the void.<eos> No, no, it's not like that.<eos> You've got it all wrong.<eos> I-I don't think I have.<eos> - Please, can't we just forget this conversation ever happened?<eos> - Nancy, please!<eos> - It's all right.<eos> Do you have happy memories of your childhood?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm not a stupid kid anymore.<eos> No.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> What about the fillings?<eos> I mean, do I start with that first, or should I maybe be doing...<eos> Oh, Mom, uh, let me call you right back.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> I thought you went home to crash.<eos> I did.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Don't you live in Pennsylvania?<eos> Yeah. It's a long story.<eos> I applied here, and then I was wait-listed, and then last night I emailed a letter to the Admissions Board that I would really like to delete... if possible.<eos> Why do you want to delete it?<eos> Jackie, it's...<eos> It's complicated.<eos> I don't want to have to get into the details.<eos> Oh, you sure did in your letter.
Moryakov... says it wasn't them.<eos> Not that I trust him.<eos> So now I just need to see if I can get Zimbabwe to talk.<eos> Today, when we took the photo...<eos> I touched your shoulder.<eos> Yes?<eos> You flinched.<eos> - What?<eos> - I felt it.<eos> No, I didn't.
- Why don't you just write a book?<eos> - Yeah, what am I supposed to write about?<eos> A virgin who plans an orgy for a bunch of prudes?<eos> And then out myself to the entire world in the process?<eos> - That's not bad, actually.<eos> - You said your career's over anyway, so it saves you from having to remember a bunch of bullshit lies all the time.<eos> These people don't want me here.<eos> - Adam just came looking for you.<eos> - Yeah, I saw him last night.<eos> You did?
- Adam?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Adam Mitchell?<eos> I think of you fondly.<eos> I am... quite fond of you as well.<eos> - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - Don't mention it. Okay.<eos> Okay, you just... - You're over thinking it.<eos> Just do it.
!<eos> I was once a man of status.<eos> A respected figure.<eos> Now I am hounded out of my own country.<eos> Believe me, I have no hand to play.<eos> Then why gamble with your daughter's life?<eos> ~ Because I had no choice!<eos> ~ More games...<eos> I had no choice because I do not have the cipher.<eos> Samara does.
No.<eos> Nobody.<eos> You know, doctor...<eos> Most hostages... they usually can't stop talking about their captors.<eos> You, on the other hand, you don't have a thing to say about yours.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> Prove to me that you were actually his hostage and not his accomplice.<eos> Do you think I had anything to do with... you saw what happened out there, right?<eos> Right now, we don't know what to think.<eos> Well, neither did he!
Girls, you ready?<eos> Good morning, Dr. Gallinger.<eos> Detective.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I had some more information regarding Dr. Cotton's death that you might be interested in hearing since, as you said, you and your wife were so fond of him.<eos> Would you follow me?<eos> What is it?<eos> We've confirmed that he was most definitely poisoned.<eos> And we now know who did it.<eos> You do?
That's nice, too.<eos> That wasn't so bad, was it?<eos> No.<eos> It was nice.<eos> Is it too soon to ask if you feel pregnant?<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> No?<eos> How would you know?<eos> I work in a hospital.<eos> Did work.
If your colleagues threw your coat in the toilet - would you also just regret that it happened?<eos> - They are adults in a workplace.<eos> - This is my daughter's workplace.<eos> That they are children does not excuse this behavior.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> So what are you going to do?<eos> I will talk to the teachers and remind the students about our zero tolerance...<eos> Why should you talk to all of the students?<eos> - We don't know who it was.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
- There isn't anyone who can confirm that.<eos> - I know what you believe.<eos> And you ... you're trying ...<eos> I didn't touch her.<eos> - I'm not talking to you any more.<eos> - Would you rather do it at the police station?<eos> Then you might want to try being a little more cooperative.<eos> I can't remember when I saw her.<eos> Can you think of anyone who would do her harm?<eos> If you do.
- Happy anniversary.<eos> - Three months.<eos> - It's a quarter paper anniversary.<eos> I bumped it up.<eos> How did it go with Hanne and Saga today?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I met her only briefly.<eos> Hanne is clever.<eos> I don't know if she understands Saga.<eos> - Who does? - I do.
But you certainly don't have to worry about running into the love of your life at a hoedown two towns over.<eos> Lemon Breeland?<eos> Are you saying I'm the love of your life?<eos> Who says I was talking about you?<eos> Maybe I was talking about the soup guy. Oh. (laughing)<eos> Oh, look, L-Lemon?<eos> Now, look, our current situation isn't good for anyone.<eos> Something has to change.<eos> Yes.<eos> We do.
No! No, it's not.<eos> You-you know what?<eos> You're probably right,<eos> Lemon's just trying to do a nice thing here.<eos> Getting over...<eos> Lavon.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Lemon has feelings for Lavon again, doesn't she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I honestly don't.
Hey, we might have gotten off on the wrong foot earlier today. But I'm just trying to make sure everybody has a pleasurable stay.<eos> I'll bet.<eos> Any means necessary.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You look the type to run a brothel, not a bed and breakfast.<eos> What crawled up your cunt, bitch?<eos> Hey... I'm leading a tour of the woods in the morning.<eos> And if you wake up and decide to abort your shitty attitude, you're welcome to come.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry. I didn't...
Okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> "Which of these equations best describes the relationship between 'X' and 'Y'?"<eos> Well, "X" is a moron who didn't call the incredibly drop-dead gorgeous "Y"<eos> to tell her he couldn't make it last night.<eos> And "X" is very, very sorry.<eos> Just don't do it again.<eos> I won't.<eos> I don't deserve you.<eos> No, you don't.
It's a prayer vigil.<eos> People in mourning get thirsty.<eos> Em, your mom's tight with the Sheriff, right?<eos> Do you know if they went through Nina's laptop?<eos> My mom just handles the autopsy.<eos> I can't believe Nina's just a body now.<eos> It kind of always was just a body, but top-shelf all the way.<eos> - Hey, man, have some respect.<eos> - I have extreme respect.<eos> And so did most of the basketball team.
She... she didn't know I was going to.<eos> She bought it herself for fun!<eos> Come on, Majid, you took out that credit card behind her back because you couldn't scrape up the cash.<eos> HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE ~ English, Mr Hassan.<eos> ~ I said, I'm going to cut your head off.<eos> I thought you'd be used to answering to women by now.<eos> By all accounts, your wife that held the purse strings.<eos> ~ She didn't. ~ Working day and night, coming home, leaving your balls by the front door, she'll chop them off, am I right?<eos> ~ Oh, you think, you think I'd kill my wife for money?<eos> ~ Your dad does.
Sure as hell do.<eos> - You wanted to see me? - I did.<eos> I take it you heard about liberty rail.<eos> - I did. - See?<eos> No harm, no foul, no mass exodus of clients.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> What's on your mind, jessica? You don't seem--<eos> I know you told scottie about mike ross.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I didn't till just now.
What are you doing here?<eos> How did you get in? You can't come in here.<eos> Mate, you can't live like this.<eos> ~ Let me help you.<eos> I can take you... ~ I can live how I want.<eos> I like it here.<eos> ~ And anyway, I wanted him to lock me in. ~ Why?<eos> Because then I'm safe.<eos> ~ You really think you're safe? In here?<eos> ~ Yeah, I do.
So I helped him over the wall but I didn't want to kick him.<eos> I know you didn't.<eos> So why did you?<eos> He said I had to.<eos> He said I had to or he'd throw me out, and I can't...<eos> The people move so fast, it's scary, I can't go back out there.<eos> Just take a moment, OK?<eos> Do you want to stop?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
I thought the gods had brought us together to try to stop my vision of the apocalypse, but now it seems we're actually making it happen.<eos> You have to get us in there so we can try and stop him.<eos> Only if I can have the ring when we do.<eos> Look at you... in your peasant's tunic.<eos> You're no son of a King. Take him the ring!<eos> He'll know if what I say is true.<eos> Who is your mother?<eos> Aethra from Troezen.<eos> How do you know my mother, Medea?<eos> I don't.
What do you make of it?<eos> It's the temple on Mount Pelion.<eos> Its wings are said to touch the sky.<eos> The next full moon is in four days, and he wants to meet at sunset.<eos> Tell me she isn't useful.<eos> How do we know it's not a trap?<eos> For heaven's sake, of course it's a trap.<eos> The question to ask is whether we can turn Lykos's trap to our advantage.<eos> How do we know the message is even from Prince Lykos?<eos> We don't.
Nothing is certain!<eos> As we feared.<eos> Choake sold his shares in Leisure.<eos> To whom?<eos> (Oh, damn! )<eos> ~ Your health and prosperity, Ross!<eos> ~ And yours, George, particularly in the light of your recent acquisition.<eos> Ah, my shares in Wheal Leisure?<eos> You must take that as a compliment.<eos> Oh, I do.
It was your cousin who first suggested it.<eos> Did he?<eos> We can't go on as we are.<eos> And I would rather fail fighting, than throw up my hands and wait for the end.<eos> And Mr Francis Poldark?<eos> My finances are, at present... somewhat complicated.<eos> So, I cannot, at this time, join you.<eos> But I wish you well...<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I do, indeed.
~ Shall I serve supper?<eos> ~ Thank you, Jinny.<eos> Have you heard from Jim?<eos> Not since last month, sir, but he was fair then.<eos> So, I am to go to the ball without a mine to my name, my estate in ruins and my wife in a made-over dress?<eos> For heaven's sake, Francis, who can afford new clothes these days?<eos> Truly, you imagine Demelza won't be trotting out her one good dress and not care a feather what people say?<eos> Well, she should, and if she does not, then she shows her ignorance.<eos> You like Demelza. Mm. Mm.<eos> I do.
St Aubyn Tresize, Alfred Barbary...<eos> They're magistrates, are they not?<eos> They may feel compelled to take a stand.<eos> ~ And then there's the matter of Matthew Sanson. ~ What of him?<eos> Once this tale gets out,<eos> George may feel obliged to respond.<eos> Why should he?<eos> Matthew's a cousin.<eos> Did you not know?<eos> No, I did not.
And I don't wanna be that.<eos> Not to you.<eos> Then don't.<eos> I know about you and my brother.<eos> Yeah, it was fucking stupid, but it happened, so...<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's not like you have a right to tell me who I can be with.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, and you let her go through with it.<eos> I was going to prison!<eos> I never would have been able to be a doctor.<eos> Yeah, I heard that, I know.<eos> Toby, it's community service, probation and that stupid anklet thing.<eos> And then she's done.<eos> It's a huge sacrifice, I know, but she saved my life.<eos> What if she would have gotten some hard-ass judge who wanted to teach her a lesson?<eos> She could've gotten a lot worse!<eos> But she didn't.
Huh?<eos> The body makes a decision the conscious mind refuses.<eos> Hey. [Sighs] I'm really glad that you caught Jason's murderer.<eos> He was a good guy.<eos> And girl.<eos> You can show your gratitude by giving me my share of that thing when you sell it.<eos> And what if I don't want to sell it?<eos> I'm you. Eventually, I get tired of everything and everybody and sell it out for a profit.<eos> You have the same disease.<eos> Everybody does.
What are you doing here?<eos> Confession.<eos> Tuesdays, Thursdays, Sunday afternoons.<eos> I came here to see you.<eos> Julie thinks you're out drinking.<eos> Don't worry, I won't tell her.<eos> Ruin your legend.<eos> With all due respect to my surroundings, fuck you.<eos> I thought you didn't believe in God.<eos> I don't.
Some parents believe that a good education is the best gift a parent can give a child.<eos> Do you?<eos> Well, better to have it than not.<eos> And changing schools, It's a... an opportunity, you know, you can reinvent yourself.<eos> You can be anything you want to be.<eos> - Do I have to go back to St. Bart's.<eos> - No.<eos> I think you're done with St. Bart's.<eos> I told your form teacher she needed to get laid.<eos> She really does.
His one chance at a good life.<eos> So, grief-stricken, he carries her up to the marital bed...<eos> Jeez.<eos> ... And tries to "love" her back to life.<eos> It was 7 days before I went looking for him.<eos> He's sick.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> As far as I'm aware, it hasn't happened since.<eos> You believe that?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Who's running this circus?<eos> I am, sir.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Would you mind telling me what in the hell is going on?<eos> Detective John Shaw.<eos> - He's had a few problems.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> Shaw was shot in the line of duty seven months ago, along with his rookie partner, Ray Jones, who lost his life.<eos> A lot of cops around here blamed him for his death.<eos> They still do.
- Where are you?<eos> - I'm on the roof.<eos> They jammed the cell phone signals in the building.<eos> Listen, I'm innocent.<eos> - John...<eos> - You gotta believe me.<eos> I've heard that you shot and killed five cops in cold blood.<eos> You know me.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> No, I don't.
Your boss - Karin.<eos> I've known it all along.<eos> Mom told me everything in the hospital.<eos> Because I was there when she lay there with all of their hoses over the entire body.<eos> Where were you then?<eos> She told me everything.<eos> My mother died without you there.<eos> For you fucked with your head instead.<eos> She loved you.<eos> She really did it.
Grace: Okay, sweetheart.<eos> Just take my hand, and let's go home.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Grace: You're safe now. (Chuckles)<eos> Emma, you don't belong here.<eos> This is not your home.<eos> I do belong here.<eos> - Emma, they don't love you.<eos> - They do.
Minx seems to understand that Drill is not real.<eos> Ah, I can't tell you what a relief that is to hear.<eos> But I still think she should continue to see me, you know, get to the real root of the problem.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The fact that an imaginary friend manifested in her life at this age is actually quite unusual.<eos> Now, most times, this kind of behavior is indicative of lack of stability, something she's having a hard time understanding, maybe problems at home, or...<eos> My husband and I, we're... working out some things.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I mean, lots of families have problems, right?<eos> Of course they do.
Minx, I'm Claire.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You do?<eos> You're the lady who makes mommy cry.<eos> This is our home.<eos> You brought that woman into my house.<eos> Minx might be our only chance of finding out where Sean is.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He did.
No.<eos> Look, this is ridiculous.<eos> We have to go.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> - Good afternoon, ma'am.<eos> - You'd better not be from the bank.<eos> - I told y'all that...<eos> - No, we're from a charity devoted to helping wounded veterans.<eos> I... You know, I'm-I'm sorry, ma'am, I think my friend has the wrong house.<eos> - No, we don't.
Maybe not, but you wanted me to say it.<eos> You don't know what I want.<eos> Don't I?<eos> No. OK, I don't know what is going on here, if... if I am totally losing my mind, or if one of the gods or goddesses is angry with me and has sent a demon.<eos> A dangerous pervert demon who never seems to have any clothes on.<eos> - Germans are not so uptight about nudity.<eos> - Mm. This is not about nudity, OK? This is...<eos> This is about decency. It is about privacy.<eos> If you were so concerned with privacy and decency, why did you look?<eos> I did not.
And you were so great in it.<eos> The world is inspired by your movies, Lito, and I want you to continue making them, OK?<eos> Dani...<eos> Hernando, I'll be fine.<eos> If life has taught me anything, it's that... I can take a punch.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Don't have too much fun without me.<eos> - What am I going to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do!
- You sure?<eos> - It's great, we're fine.<eos> We have it, OK?<eos> And your, uh... friend is here.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> My bodyguard. Yeah.<eos> - Hello, Kala.<eos> - Papa-ji.<eos> - I had no idea you came to the temple.<eos> - I don't.
My father could never forgive me for that.<eos> When I was eight years old, my father made me join a swim club.<eos> He'd been on the same club and... he said that the things that he learned in that locker room were the things that made him the man that he is today.<eos> I hated that locker room.<eos> At that age, I was really uncomfortable with my body.<eos> I didn't like to be naked, especially in front of other boys.<eos> But you had to take a shower before you could go in the pool, so I would do it, but I would wear my suit and a tee shirt.<eos> And the boys would tease me, but I would try to hurry and... ignore them, and it...<eos> it worked for a while.<eos> And then one day it didn't.
My daughter's been missing for four hours.<eos> Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to share that information.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> This is a federal case now, Miss Wilson.<eos> Detective Wilson.<eos> We appreciate all the information that you've given us.<eos> But the truth is, cop or no cop, you should've never had the authority to oversee the abduction of your own daughter.<eos> Which is why you're no longer on the case.<eos> You don't have the authority to do that.<eos> Actually, I do.
Oh, good. Go get it translated.<eos> Already did. And it says...<eos> "You will be betrayed by your partner."<eos> - That's right.<eos> - And you found it where?<eos> Buried under a stack of ious made out to Dominic Chan.<eos> If it was up to me, you'd be out of that uniform tomorrow.<eos> Still have to write the exam.<eos> [Chuckles] I never would have taken you as someone that believed in psychics.<eos> I don't.
Now.<eos> Choose your attendants.<eos> Clarke, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> If this truce doesn't hold, I killed Finn for nothing.<eos> Clarke is right.<eos> We need to do this.<eos> Peace with the Grounders is the only way we'll survive.<eos> Oh, I don't think they know what peace is.<eos> The commander does.
You won't be haunted by this forever.<eos> The pain will fade.<eos> What got me through was loving you.<eos> What is it?<eos> You're talking about dad?<eos> What I did to Finn was nothing like what you did to him.<eos> Don't do this now, Clarke.<eos> I was protecting everyone.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> - You did.
Hey, how many years have you been fucking the same woman for now?<eos> - How many years?<eos> - That's not funny.<eos> No, it's not funny.<eos> Seventeen years, though.<eos> That's a long fucking...<eos> Seventeen years.<eos> Mind you, hey, if you have to pick someone to fuck for the rest of your life...<eos> Diana, fucking beautiful.<eos> You did well.
No, it's not funny.<eos> Seventeen years, though.<eos> That's a long fucking...<eos> Seventeen years.<eos> Mind you, hey, if you have to pick someone to fuck for the rest of your life...<eos> Diana, fucking beautiful.<eos> You did well.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She is. And I did.<eos> - You did well.
It's been crazy.<eos> We've had so much going on.<eos> The pier dedication and the big party.<eos> And then everything with Dad.<eos> - I just wish you'd said something.<eos> - I knew how upset you would be.<eos> I didn't want to let you down.<eos> - Let us down?<eos> - My marriage failed, okay?<eos> It did.
Hey, where's Mom?<eos> She's out back. Hey!<eos> I thought we had an understanding.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I watch your back.<eos> You watch my back.<eos> Are you mad at me for some reason?<eos> How about you lied to me?<eos> About the will.<eos> - No, I didn't.

Oh, good, you're still here.<eos> Is your son behind this?<eos> Paige thinks it's an elaborate setup.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think I'd like my son home and this whole business to go away.<eos> - So you want me to pay the ransom.<eos> - Not unless you have to.<eos> But there can be no bloodshed and no press.<eos> - I have to say that.<eos> - No, you don't.
What sexual dysfunction are you proposing we treat?<eos> Mine.<eos> We have an opportunity here, to find a cure.<eos> Think of all the people we could help.<eos> Us. A real couple.<eos> You're not really worried about the kids, Gin. It's that study that you're worried about.<eos> I let my kids go for nothing.<eos> I never meant to hurt Virginia.<eos> No.<eos> You never do.
You can just go.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Then who's gonna deal with the power company?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let them send a bill.<eos> It'll take care of itself.<eos> That's great.<eos> That's a really amazing system you've discovered.<eos> - Do you have a problem?<eos> - Yeah, Cameron, I do.
Attention all passengers.<eos> We appreciate your patience.<eos> The train departing for Washington DC, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville, Orlando and terminating in Tampa/Miami should be arriving shortly.<eos> The right thing to do is usually the hardest.<eos> Well, this is going to be very tough.<eos> You know, when we get to DC... we get a fresh shot at putting that bio-weapon together again.<eos> Maybe, uh...<eos> Let's focus on getting there, OK?<eos> I know I don't have a right to ask you that...<eos> No, you don't.
What'd you say?<eos> You want me to light your fire?<eos> Do you think I'm pretty?<eos> Yo...<eos> Your...<eos> That is the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.<eos> Tim's too busy jerking off, to Asian fairy porn, to notice me anymore.<eos> Do you like Asian fairy porn?<eos> Of course you do.<eos> All men do.
Why shouldn't I blow your fucking head off, right now?<eos> Because you're not a murderer, James.<eos> A killer, maybe.<eos> But not a murderer.<eos> What?<eos> Bad things happen.<eos> But you're forgiven.<eos> That's all the plant is trying to tell you.<eos> It wants to help you, James.<eos> It does.

I'll drop you home on my way to the airport.<eos> Dan...<eos> When you said that you can't keep trying, trying to make me see something that I already know...<eos> I can't.<eos> You're right.<eos> You shouldn't have to, because I-I do already know.<eos> Ever since I was a little girl, it's like I-I've been holding my breath... waiting for something, something I can't even put a name to to fall into place so that I could finally breathe.<eos> I know you understand this.<eos> But I-I want to... breathe.<eos> I-I do.

Really?<eos> Well, whoever it is, I'm guessing they don't get invited to the block party.<eos> - We're on the East Side, Nick.<eos> (PEOPLE CHANTING SLOGANS)<eos> PEOPLE".<eos> No justice, no peace.<eos> The best thing is, he has to rely on the districts that never vote.<eos> He had everything to the east where no one ever misses an election there.<eos> - 'Cause they give a shit, right?<eos> - This year they do, for sure, Hank.
You know, I'm guessing you got yourself a nice little place in Manhattan somewhere, or Park Slope?<eos> Am I right?<eos> (CHUCKLES) But, you see, we live here.<eos> And when I pick up a copy of The New York Times and I read what you are writing about me, and about this kid mayor who's gone all wet, and about the housing thing,<eos> I know that it's got nothing to do with what's going on here.<eos> And what's going on?<eos> People working for their homes, for their neighborhoods.<eos> They want to keep what they have.<eos> And you really think that building a couple hundred units of public housing is gonna wreck those neighborhoods? (SCOFFING)<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's the same.<eos> It drops down property values, it brings in the bad element.<eos> It's just I don't agree with you, okay?<eos> They said you went to the other side.<eos> I didn't believe them.<eos> You working with the housing people now, right?<eos> They tried the same program in Greenburgh and it worked, Jack.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> You really think it could make a difference?<eos> Yes, I do.
Help manage.<eos> And I'm a phone call away, always.<eos> And, speaking of money...<eos> Here is your checkbook.<eos> And... your ATM card.<eos> Your code is Amantha's birthday.<eos> I don't think anyone here knows who Amantha is, Mother.<eos> You remember?<eos> 08-11.<eos> You do.
- Pick one. Pick one you want.<eos> - You having fun?<eos> - No.<eos> You ever handle a real firearm before?<eos> Gives you a sense of power.<eos> Um, you guys are ruining my rehearsal.<eos> Come on, y'all.<eos> I got to get up out of here, man.<eos> All right, we out.<eos> We didn't...
I saw on the news... It could have been a neighbor that killed Tom?<eos> Well...<eos> The press know even less than the police do.<eos> They just make things up as they go along...<eos> Hurting innocent people, ruining lives.<eos> Did you know Tom was yours?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I have no business asking that question.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I didn't...
And who will suffer?<eos> My kids, my reputation.<eos> Guilty whether you did it or not.<eos> Yeah, well, that's why I'm going to court... fight the good fight.<eos> Look, you should go to the press, set the record straight.<eos> The press don't want the truth.<eos> They want a good story.<eos> Then give them yours.<eos> No one knows you're innocent until you tell them.<eos> The police do.
Man, I know I've been acting crazy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I still can't remember that night.<eos> Cornell's all over me.<eos> Maybe I'm just paranoid.<eos> No, man, she definitely has wood for you, but...<eos> I got your back, okay?<eos> Remember that.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Are you bipolar?<eos> How do you know your mother was?<eos> Shit she... Stuff she did.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like she tried to kill herself.<eos> And then would take us on a shopping spree. She would sleep depressed for months. And then would throw us a big party for one of our birthdays.<eos> And then leave us on the street corner to buy drugs. Should I go on?<eos> - Have you done any of those things?<eos> Police report says you stole your lover's baby and took him...<eos> I didn't.
What, do you have a lojack on him or something?<eos> Uh... Everything okay?<eos> Yeah! Just peachy.<eos> Oh, do not ask.<eos> I am just having a bad day.<eos> Okay, well, it's about to get worse.<eos> Look, i-i-i need to go kiss gainey's bottom, Try to convince him to co-host this game with us.<eos> And i just can't do it alone.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Oh, of course you do!
You know, there is no religious directive on file, so okay if I recycle him?<eos> Factory on 39 needs some fertilizer.<eos> Not yet.<eos> I'd like to know what the hell Holden is discussing with the Captain right now.<eos> For all we know, he could be working out a deal.<eos> Yeah, for himself.<eos> The only thing I see here is an incoming ship.<eos> One you can't even identify.<eos> How do you know they're coming for Naomi?<eos> We don't.
Tamsin.<eos> I knew you guys didn't like me on the force, but this is a little extreme, don't ya think?<eos> Your shifts up.<eos> What's up motherfae-ers.<eos> You're doubt overcame Hades.<eos> Well, she is carrying his child.<eos> You're doubting for two.<eos> Where's Bo?<eos> She went Pyrippus.<eos> No, she didn't.
And you broke my heart.<eos> A mistake that I made twice.<eos> And one that I would never make again.<eos> Lauren, we're messy.<eos> We're complicated.<eos> That hasn't changed.<eos> I know.<eos> And I hope that it never does.<eos> Do you think that we can do this?<eos> I do.
- That is badass.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How did you find out you had powers?<eos> In high school, back in Seattle, we used to sneak out onto the docks, climb the cargo cranes, you know, drink beer.<eos> Do dares.<eos> Who can go out the farthest on the gantry.<eos> I was out there pretty far one night, and the wind gusted and I slipped.<eos> I fell.<eos> I was falling, and all I wanted was to miss the ground, but I was gonna hit it no matter what.<eos> And then, I didn't.
Do you understand?<eos> That place was made for all of us.<eos> Together.<eos> I wanted to surprise you.<eos> And you... You wanted to surprise me.<eos> I let you know me.<eos> See me.<eos> I gave you a rare gift.<eos> But you didn't want it.<eos> Didn't I?
bent you, twisted you and trimmed you, head, hands, arms, and legs.<eos> A topiary.<eos> This is my design.<eos> A valentine written on a broken man.<eos> Will...<eos> I do feel closer to Hannibal here.<eos> God only knows where I'd be without him.<eos> He left us his, uh... his broken heart.<eos> How did he know we were here?<eos> He didn't.
He accepts him.<eos> Now, who among us doesn't want understanding and acceptance?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You did this.<eos> You set him free.<eos> It was you I wanted to set free.<eos> You said Hannibal was curious if I would kill.<eos> You were curious, too.<eos> - I didn't want this.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Your heart shows no sign of weakness.<eos> The cage won't hold.<eos> I think I know how to take Mount Weather.<eos> We've been trying to get inside, but they've already let us in.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your army is already there locked in cages.<eos> We just need someone on the inside to let them out.<eos> Bellamy.<eos> You have faith in him?<eos> I do.
One minute.<eos> That's the window.<eos> Small window.<eos> Why don't we just take out the backup generator, too?<eos> Bellamy's inside.<eos> Have him do it.<eos> Leaving them without power that long would kill them all, and as I said, that's not the mission.<eos> Besides, we lost contact with Bellamy.<eos> What?<eos> We did?
We haven't sounded that good since the very first duet that we did.<eos> - Do you remember what it was?<eos> - No, I'm blanking.<eos> I'm kidding, of course I do.<eos> It was "Baby, it's cold outside".<eos> The entire time we were singing I just wanted to turn off that damn boom box and confess my undying love for you and give you the world's most passionate kiss.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, why didn't you?<eos> I wasn't sure if you felt the same way.<eos> And you didn't.
- Okay. - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Uh, oh. That was a stop sign.<eos> Y-yeah, it was.<eos> You just went right through it.<eos> Uh, y-yes, I did.<eos> Well, could you do me a flavor and stop at the next one?<eos> Carol, stop signs are there to mediate traffic.<eos> And traffic doesn't exist anymore, so essentially stop signs don't either.<eos> Yeah, except that they do.
I'm sorry you had to witness that unpleasant encounter.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Leclair, can you solve this disaster?<eos> We have very little time, but we will do our best.<eos> It will be fine.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> - Tell me how I can help.<eos> - Leave it to the experts, Gordon.<eos> - But -<eos> - In this crisis, you don't want to summon the board.<eos> Yes, we do.
- I know what I'm doing.<eos> - Do you?
This isn't going to work.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> You look like my father.<eos> It is his body, but he's dead.<eos> And I get it, you feel bad, but you... whoever you are...<eos> are nothing to me.<eos> Claire, that's not true.<eos> I'm in large part responsible for the way your life has unfolded.<eos> I-I have a responsibility to help you.<eos> No. You don't.
Some of the boys from the other team called Dennis a cheat.<eos> My son was never a cheat.<eos> He was an inspiration!<eos> A special boy!<eos> He was doping.<eos> You again!<eos> I thought I made myself clear!<eos> Mr Goodman, please, I know Dennis was using some kind of steroid or testosterone and I think you know that too.<eos> Now, we need to find that missing sports bag.<eos> Do we?
Drinking's against college rules but I wanted him to be punished for what he'd done.<eos> Rachel, on the day Dennis died, you mentioned he asked you about his drink, about the colour.<eos> Yes, I think that's what he said.<eos> Had ever spoken before of things looking unusual or... or a bit odd?<eos> No.<eos> Had he ever mentioned anything about dizzy spells?<eos> No.<eos> Is it my fault?<eos> Please, tell me that I didn't kill him!<eos> You did not.
Let's reward failure.<eos> Because while America is struggling with type 2 diabetes,<eos> China is colonizing Mars.<eos> Not on my watch!<eos> All right, Double Stuf, come on.<eos> Hoist yourself up there again.<eos> Come on, lad.<eos> And hike up your shorts, please, before some poor soul falls into your butt crack.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> We do?

Now, I'm gonna go ahead and guess the boys are an 11 and not a 2, which would make them toddlers.<eos> Now, unless there's some law been broken, think it's time for us to be on our way.<eos> I promised the boys' wives I'd have them home for supper, and I am, if nothing else, a man of my word.<eos> Okay.<eos> I got your names and your plate number.<eos> I'm gonna radio ahead and make sure you make it out of State.<eos> If not, I'm gonna put out an APB and have you boys rounded up.<eos> And then we'll talk again.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do.
See, we can't leave because we're the future, and they're the past.<eos> The past can no more become the future than the future can become the past.<eos> Okay.<eos> We said our piece.<eos> Just don't be offended next time if I don't say hello before I shoot.<eos> - Geez! - Hmm?<eos> Karl Weathers, that is a good way to get yourself shot!<eos> Your lesser half gave us a key, asked us to look out for you and the little one while he's gone.<eos> Do I strike you as someone who needs lookin' after?<eos> You do not.

Uh, I've been up since 4:00.<eos> [Chuckles] Sleeping in one of these interview rooms - isn't all that relaxing.<eos> - [Chuckles]<eos> Uh, you know, I don't believe in past lives or ghosts or astrology, but this room... it, um, has a weird energy in it.<eos> Sitting in that chair, a person's whole future can change.<eos> Mine did, a long time ago.
The fuzz!<eos> I like you, Titus.<eos> We represent Myron Affleck.<eos> I want you to read for his Spidermen musical.<eos> Get Myron on the phone.<eos> Try the pay phone first.<eos> If he's not there, try the car, where he lives.<eos> Pardon my French, but, Au bon pain!<eos> How do I know you?<eos> You don't.
I triangulated the gps on your phone.<eos> Seriously?<eos> No, I just always wanted to say that.<eos> You used the company card.<eos> Mind if I come in? Uh... Sure.<eos> And also, do you mind telling me. What the hell you're doing in houston?<eos> It doesn't matter now.<eos> No, I think it does matter.<eos> I just drove 14 hours to get here.<eos> No, it doesn't, okay?
You know how this works.<eos> I need something, and you need something.<eos> Tell me everything about this new group you're working with. What new group?<eos> You know.<eos> Your drinking buddies from the bar.<eos> I want to know their names, how you met, your mission.<eos> Their mission?<eos> No, they got nothing to do with el jefe.<eos> Oh, so you don't want to see your brother again.<eos> No, no, i... I do.
Ah, look at me.<eos> My first international summit, and I am a nervous wreck.<eos> Have we done the right thing coming here?<eos> Wanting a better life for your people is always the right thing.<eos> You know what I'm up against, Helen.<eos> The only reason I'm here is to promote peace, while the warlords back home are ready to start civil war.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Breathe, Abdul.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> We all do.
It's all in here, every horrible thing Eva Sinclair has ever done.<eos> Well, you ask me, it's a good thing you took over her body.<eos> Anyone who does this kind of stuff to kids has it coming.<eos> Marcel, it doesn't matter what she's done.<eos> I've still appropriated her body without her consent.<eos> I'm not gonna argue with you, Rebekah.<eos> I'm just saying maybe it's a public service, but I get why it's complicated.<eos> I mean, it makes sense why you won't kiss me.<eos> It's why I wouldn't kiss you if I wanted to, which I don't. Mm-hmm.<eos> I don't, Marcel.
Oliver, I told you before, if Thea finds out you've been lying to her all this time, you will lose her...forever.<eos> How's Tatsu?<eos> She'll be better when we're far away from here.<eos> Your bow.<eos> If you want anything else, take it quickly.<eos> We're leaving in five minutes.<eos> We're not coming back.<eos> Oh, we can't just run.<eos> Waller knows I tried to steal the virus to get Tatsu back.<eos> Even if she didn't,
So when they told me<eos> Someone ignored my orders to lay low;<eos> When they told me one of my crew shot a cop...<eos> I beat the man who said it was you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Danny, that cop?<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> What we're planning here requires two things.<eos> No mistakes, and the cops not knowing anything.<eos> They still don't.
Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> 'Cause you got that crease between your eyebrows that tells me things most definitely are not.<eos> Something awful has happened.<eos> And I-- I need a favor.<eos> A really big favor.<eos> Last time you asked me for a big favor, I had to loan you my helicopter.<eos> Don't need your helicopter.<eos> I need your jet.<eos> Well, Oliver does, but both of us.
I love you, Dad.<eos> Ra's told me that the confusion would pass.<eos> You have no idea what you've done.<eos> What I've done?<eos> She's alive, Malcolm.<eos> What I did saved her life.<eos> She thinks Moira's still alive.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I didn't know what I was doing, ok?<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> I'm so sorry, Laurel.<eos> If Merlyn drugged you... then it wasn't your fault.<eos> But how could you work with him?<eos> How could you stand by his side?<eos> Because of the threat of the League.<eos> We have to work with him.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
- You look ok.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Not even a scratch.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> How did you get him back?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> What matters is, you didn't kill him.<eos> No, I wanted Ra's to kill him.<eos> And I still do.
We're just going to negotiate with him now?<eos> Are we just going to give in?<eos> Turn over an innocent person?<eos> She's not innocent!<eos> She's the daughter of the Demon.<eos> She's killed hundreds of people.<eos> Enough!<eos> The only thing that matters is getting Lyla back.<eos> I don't care how we do it.<eos> Yes, you do.
John, it wasn't about trust!<eos> It was about making sure that you and you were safe.<eos> I had to keep the circle as small as possible.<eos> How did you expect to repair all this once you got back?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I flew with Ra's and the virus to Starling and I sabotaged the plane.<eos> The plan... was to kill Ra's and destroy the virus.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> How did you expect to survive the plane crash?<eos> You didn't.
I should have known it was a waste of time.<eos> A guy your age, and single, can only be a bastard.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Never mind.<eos> - Calm down.<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - Sorry, calm down.<eos> - I want to go.<eos> - I made a mistake coming here.<eos> - No, you didn't.
King, King, King, Reinaldo is our King!<eos> Good, right?<eos> "Reinaldo is our King".<eos> King, King, King, Reinaldo is our King!<eos> That's not what I've heard.<eos> King, King, King, Reinaldo is our King!<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I think you're missing a zero.<eos> - If I liked it.<eos> You didn't?
Just... stop. Okay?<eos> Mom, whatever you are planning, it's dangerous.<eos> You're going to get yourself killed.<eos> But we... we came up with the plan together.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> When you came to see me!<eos> Where?<eos> ! At the institution.<eos> I didn't even know you were in there.<eos> Yes, yes you did. Yes you did!
I know.<eos> Hey...<eos> Visitations.<eos> He didn't just let her rot...<eos> Looks like he took care of her.<eos> And her response is positive.<eos> Calm.<eos> There's another visitor.<eos> I thought you said that you didn't know she was there.<eos> I didn't.
What?<eos> Yeah, he gave me this, though.<eos> I drew a path for you.<eos> Come on, Captain.<eos> I'll take you home.<eos> Dorothy's probably wondering where you are.<eos> Aschell told me that kid was ready to roll on his brother, and you put the goddamn brakes on.<eos> Well, Aschell was out of line.<eos> I thought you wanted my job.<eos> I do.
Did he like her?<eos> Well, his graduation quote was,<eos> "s.W. -- Leaving your orbit Is like making earth say goodbye to the sun."<eos> He realllikes her.<eos> No mention of him in her quote.<eos> I definitely know her. I thought about nothing else for almost four years.<eos> When's the last time you talked to her?<eos> Uh -- um... High school. But most of those conversations happened in my head.<eos> Do you really think she, uh, had something to do with this pipeline bomb?<eos> Yeah, we do.
Hey.<eos> It is.<eos> And the best gift... is you and Lemon.<eos> Couldn't ask for a better man for my girl to end up with.<eos> W-Well, that means a lot.<eos> But... how on earth did you two end up an item out of nowhere like this?<eos> I...<eos> Wait, seriously, you really don't know?<eos> No, on second thought, uh, I don't want to know.<eos> No, no, I don't.
We should get you in the shower, Captain.<eos> Here we go. All right?<eos> I didn't mean to get that drunk.<eos> You don't have to say anything, Captain.<eos> I am gonna talk to the Mayor for you-- tell him I want you to take over for me when I retire next year.<eos> I told you-- you don't have to do that.<eos> If you want the job, I do.<eos> It's not gonna be enough.<eos> You know they like Lieutenant Aschell better.<eos> Who does?
Junior.<eos> Listen, hold up.<eos> Get off me.<eos> Get off me!<eos> Don't go up there.<eos> Don't go up there.<eos> Junior.<eos> Mac.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I didn't do that, Junior.
Now, there's some indication he encountered an as yet unidentified person or persons shortly before his death.<eos> Now, the trajectory of his fall suggests he fell backwards.<eos> But his injuries are not conclusive with him having been pushed.<eos> Until we know otherwise, we're treating his death as suspicious.<eos> Now, have we got a less grisly photo?<eos> Something that gives a sense of the man...<eos> Selfie from the daughter.<eos> Taken and posted on social media about 20 minutes before death.<eos> Well, he looks happy enough, doesn't he?<eos> They both do.
~ Is this about Tom?<eos> Have you found summat?<eos> Is she all right?<eos> His Ellie.<eos> Shocked, I think.<eos> That'll be tough for her.<eos> I know how that one feels.<eos> Why do you need me?<eos> Well, it's our understanding that you blamed Owen for the death of your son.<eos> I do, yeah.
Oh.<eos> Hello again, Ms. McGrail.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Small world.<eos> Yeah, it's really small.<eos> Some people say follow the money. I say follow the roses.<eos> When asked about his knowledge of the crime<eos> Dmitri green replied that it wasn't what it looked like.<eos> McGrail then replied, "it looks like something?"<eos> Well, it did.
Well, it did.<eos> I'm you...<eos> filled with shock and outrage that my boyfriend is paying another woman for sex. But I have a relationship with her, as well.<eos> I sent her flowers.<eos> Why?<eos> Am I a lesbian?<eos> Did you want a lawyer?<eos> - Want us to call one of your bosses?<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, no. I don't...
And two, the fail-safes on the ride never engaged because the coaster's computer never detected an emergency.<eos> You mean in time to stop the accident?<eos> I mean at all.<eos> According to this diagnostic, the coaster never crashed.<eos> What?<eos> There's no record of anything going wrong.<eos> Coaster ran every required pre-ride check.<eos> Proper functionality across the board.<eos> Yeah, it's like it never happened.<eos> But it did.
Do you have any... what do you call that again?<eos> - Evidence?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I have a rock.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'll check it out but you know, Kristin may not be wrong.<eos> You live where you live, you got to worry about everyone else.<eos> You live somewhere else, you only have to worry about yourself.<eos> Understand?<eos> - You do, all right.
They're just sick.<eos> It's sad.<eos> And for what, huh?<eos> How the hell is it worth the risk to do that?<eos> You know what I realized trying to understand people?<eos> - What?<eos> - Don't try to understand 'em.<eos> I know what I'd kill for and what I'd die for.<eos> You served.<eos> You do too.
I had a vision of him murdering Wally Walker.<eos> This is important.<eos> When you had the vision, were you holding an apple bong, or did you just smoke an old-school spliff?<eos> I'm not screwing around, Clive.<eos> I'm just wondering if this vision also contained winged horses and a dancing pizza.<eos> I'm not saying you didn't see it, but no psychic bats 1.000.<eos> You're going after the wrong guy.<eos> And from what I could gather, he's done it before, like, a lot.<eos> How is this guy even connected to Walker?<eos> Something to do with debts.
Don't you ever get sick of this place?<eos> Why don't you sell it?<eos> No way!<eos> Do you know what's about to happen here?<eos> Ostia is going to be like Las Vegas.<eos> You'll see how much it'll be worth then!<eos> Why do you like it so much?<eos> Because it's all mine.<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> You don't?
This is my own deal.<eos> Politics isn't your thing.<eos> Forget it.<eos> And who's thing is it?<eos> Yours?<eos> Sorry, but you've got to make room for me.<eos> I'm sitting at this table too.<eos> Why do you touch your dick when you talk?<eos> Got the clap?<eos> - Maybe you do.
May I?<eos> I'm going home tomorrow.<eos> Why?<eos> You can stay as long as you like... at least until they kick me out.<eos> Who's going to kick you out?<eos> No, I just meant it... as a joke.<eos> I feel good here, with you.<eos> You do?<eos> Can I say something stupid?<eos> I do it all the time!
Lord, grant him eternal rest, and let Your perpetual light shine upon them...<eos> O God, creator and redeemer of all the faithful, grant the souls of the deceased universal remission of sins.<eos> Seba!<eos> I just want to know the name of the guy who was with you.<eos> What do you care?<eos> He wasn't involved in Dagger's death.<eos> I think he got Number 8 to get rid of a witness.<eos> He didn't call Number 8.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
Spare me the modesty.<eos> You've solved too many crimes to be the bumbling idiot you appear to be.<eos> No, I am a bumbling idiot.<eos> But I see patterns to things.<eos> You seem to know a lot about me.<eos> You've shown up on our radar a few times.<eos> Have you got a file on me?<eos> Why don't we pool our resources?<eos> We both want the same thing, after all.<eos> - Do we?
I am not at liberty to divulge that information.<eos> But this is a matter of international security.<eos> I am very sorry.<eos> Tell the team we're checking in.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> May I ask your name?<eos> Heidi, sir.<eos> Do you know who I am, Heidi?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, Mr. Secretary.
Tell the team we're checking in.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> May I ask your name?<eos> Heidi, sir.<eos> Do you know who I am, Heidi?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, Mr. Secretary.<eos> Have you been watching the news, Heidi?<eos> Do you know what's going on in Pakistan?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
Dude gets loose.<eos> All he's got to do is roll on out of here.<eos> Can't even keep himself clean that long.<eos> Brothers, man, they always bitch...<eos> How a brother can't get a break.<eos> They let his ass go, cuts a dude, O.D.s his girl.<eos> I didn't do nothing, but I'm the one still stuck in here.<eos> Prosecutors want to talk to you.<eos> Hell, yeah, they want to talk to me.<eos> Now they do.
- Yeah, okay.<eos> - Sit.<eos> - Ready? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You're not closing them.<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> Ready?<eos> One, two, three, owl.<eos> - Ah! - You did.<eos> - You looked just like an owl.<eos> - Who-oo did?
I'll hide you.<eos> Walk behind me.<eos> Hey, what are you doing later?<eos> Working.<eos> Want to go for a drive?<eos> Where?<eos> ( singsongy ) It's a surprise.<eos> ( singsongy ) I don't like surprises.<eos> Everybody likes surprises.<eos> No, everyone does not.
I'm not a doctor.<eos> Can we ease up a little, please?<eos> Could I have a word with you, please?<eos> In private?<eos> Coop just gave me his two weeks' notice.<eos> Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> He said he had a conversation with you that was a real eye-opener.<eos> Did you tell him your little tale about the Icelandic condominiums?<eos> Norwegian?<eos> No, I did not.
I danced a bunch of very slow polkas.<eos> - And I came away with these. - Oh.<eos> Now all I want to do is eat them.<eos> No, you mean sell them.<eos> I think I had a better day than you.<eos> - Come.<eos> - Do I have to get up?<eos> Yes.<eos> I got a job.<eos> - You did?
Then what?<eos> I was an accountant, so I knew spreadsheets.<eos> I catalogued Dr. Murray's treatment protocol.<eos> Dr. Murray was obsessed with data.<eos> He wanted to prove to the medical community that they were wrong,<eos> That he had the answer to curing all disease... with sound.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> It seems crazy, but that's what I saw happening.<eos> - Everyone got better.<eos> - But then someone didn't.
- He's awesome.<eos> - Well, we knew that.<eos> And if an awesome guy like that found his way to me, then... Another awesome guy will find his way to you.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And the next awesome person<eos> - doesn't have to show up for a while.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do you wanna hear my revelation about you?<eos> No, I-I got my own.<eos> - You did?

Daddy had to go out of town on a work thing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I totally forgot.<eos> Did you eat?<eos> Just some cheese and crackers.<eos> All right, well, let's go home.<eos> I'll make you pancakes, okay?<eos> How many kids were killed on the bus?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
You think that's nasty, you should try the kiwi.<eos> Jackie, I seriously hope you were not administering care to a patient at this hospital.<eos> Gloria, they were short a nurse.<eos> I made it very clear you were not to touch any patient.<eos> If I did not touch that patient, she would be dead.<eos> - Is that what you want? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> It's my first day on the floor.<eos> I'm still figuring out where the forks go, if you know what I mean.<eos> I do not.
The whole world wants to know who is responsible.<eos> Your troops won't let anyone near the blast site.<eos> Because they don't want the world to know.<eos> My brother... he's in the FSB.<eos> We spoke a week ago.<eos> I haven't heard from him since.<eos> Are you absolutely certain about this?<eos> Alexi, go public.<eos> We'll protect you.<eos> Like you did Xander Feng?
Yes?<eos> Sir, President Petrov is on the line.<eos> I'll take it in here.<eos> Shut the door, please.<eos> - Viktor.<eos> - We know it was your men.<eos> What was?<eos> Did you think we wouldn't detect you?<eos> Whatever you're accusing us of, I don't know anything about it.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.

Well we're born alone and we die alone.<eos> That's pretty heartless.<eos> Heart is overrated.<eos> Or maybe you just say that 'cause somebody broke yours.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Let's just say I'm really good at reading people.<eos> Look, the point is... if this Maestro is so great maybe he can help you too.<eos> I'm okay, I'm fine.<eos> How did you know I don't like being alone?<eos> Because nobody does, not all the time.
Oh really?<eos> You don't think so?<eos> You know what?<eos> This place is getting on my nerves.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> Everything was fine until Dances With Wolves showed up.<eos> Everyone looks like someone they're not, you're all afraid of something you don't even know.<eos> And the only person who can help me is some mysterious Maestro that no-one knows how to get to.<eos> or I know someone who does.<eos> You do?
Since day one.<eos> And I will always have your back.<eos> You understand?<eos> People think I got two brothers.<eos> They're fucking wrong.<eos> I only got one.<eos> Why are the lights off?<eos> - I don't know. You want a drink?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't.
Don't want you keeling over after you take this.<eos> Peyote?<eos> Raul says you're stuck in your head and this is one of the best ways to get out.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> You're, uh, not going alone.<eos> I gotta sit this one out, Coach.<eos> You know better than that.<eos> The bigger the tribe, the easier it is to call on the spirits.<eos> How do I know this'll work?<eos> You don't.
No kidding.<eos> All right, what do we know about ABADDON?<eos> Aren't they some kind of anarchist hacker group?<eos> All about bringing down the system?<eos> I don't know, but if what they're plotting is the sin that breaks the next Horseman's seal...<eos> Then every minute counts.<eos> Peter, how much time is left on ABADDON's countdown clock?<eos> About 35 hours.<eos> Well, do we know anything about their leader?<eos> Nobody does.
I mean, she's an outsider.<eos> Nadia's father died... we had no choice.<eos> But to be honest, I worry about her.<eos> If you share what we're doing with Alan, you could put him in the same kind of danger.<eos> And this scar... is from when I wrestled a polar bear.<eos> Okay, you two, it's time for bed.<eos> But Raul was telling me about his scars. Oh.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, sunshine, if you go to bed right now, I'll tell you about the scar I got when I got zapped from an electric eel.<eos> - Mom has a scar.<eos> - No, I don't.

What kind of sin is he about to commit?<eos> Erin!<eos> This is pretty serious, Ms. Calder.<eos> Your blood pressure's very low, which is why you fainted.<eos> I want to run some more tests, but I will say that a hematoma that size should not just appear overnight.<eos> I probably just bumped into something without realizing it, that's all.<eos> You need to be admitted to a hospital.<eos> This could be serious, and until we figure out what's going on, I want you monitored.<eos> I can have an ambulance transfer you to the nearest cardiology lab if you don't have someone who can drive you.<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I was abandoned once.<eos> Cast aside by those who should've cared, but I stood up and fought back.<eos> And you can do the same, Leland.<eos> Do you know what it's like to lose someone?<eos> To have them just snatched away from you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
It's just... the answers, they just... they just came so quickly.<eos> The answers to what? - Where the fulgurite came from.<eos> I found something in the desert in Mali, something beyond incredible.<eos> I... It may be the key to understanding Drill.<eos> I mean... It may... It may explain everything, Claire.<eos> You...<eos> - You don't seem to be...<eos> - Because I knew.<eos> Sean... he told me that he felt something.<eos> Oh, of course he did.
I, can't just up and leave;<eos> I got obligations.<eos> You know, I got real feelings for AnnaBeth.<eos> And I could actually see a future there, so...<eos> You know, sometimes we just... we do things for the people that we care about.<eos> Which is why... you should be calling Wade right now.<eos> I just tried, but he's still not answering.<eos> So I don't believe in marriage.<eos> You know, my parents... theirs was a complete sham, so why would I?<eos> - Because Wade does.
- Jesus, do you mind?<eos> I'm a medical professional.<eos> Of course I don't mind. Zoey, Reuben is all set.<eos> Did you call a DJ?<eos> I have 14,000 songs on my iPhone.<eos> - I'm a party in a purse.<eos> - Uh, we don't have speakers.<eos> Patch it in the PA.<eos> Whoa, genius.<eos> I do my best thinking on the toilet, too.
They hauled him away last night before I could even talk to him.<eos> He said... He said he remembers.<eos> Everything.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Bye.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hello, Henry. My God.<eos> So, you remember me?<eos> Of course I do.
That's curious, don't you think?<eos> I'm sure he had his reasons.<eos> And I wonder why you're lying to me, Ted.<eos> I'm not lying to you, Janet.<eos> Okay, maybe not, but you're sure not telling me something.<eos> I asked him to leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> And I asked him to tell you the reason.<eos> Well, he didn't.
That's where I took her after the Pizza Barn.<eos> She was a little disappointed at the detour but not totally surprised.<eos> We made out some.<eos> She was a sweet little kisser.<eos> And that's... that's about as far as she wanted to go, really.<eos> But I had my mind set on doing it.<eos> You know, getting it over with.<eos> I mean, that's how I looked at it at the time.<eos> Anyway things progressed.<eos> We did a little car wrestling.
- Who?<eos> - Michel-whatever with glasses.<eos> No... he's over with.<eos> He doesn't know it's over over, but it's over.<eos> I bet you laughed. Yeah, I did.<eos> He's funny.<eos> He's so unfunny, Michel what's-his-name.<eos> Wildly pretentious.<eos> He finds wit in his blandness. Why not dump him?<eos> I just didn't.
That fucking hurt!<eos> Bring him in.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You okay, Paul?<eos> I felt nothing.<eos> Should I talk to Esther?<eos> Ask her to write me.<eos> I'd like to see Pr. Behanzin.<eos> Got an appointment?<eos> No, I don't.
Why's the treasure in a grave?<eos> There was no treasure in the grave. No.<eos> This is what pirates do.<eos> They leave a map or a code that needs to be ciphered.<eos> This is typical, classic pirate bullshit.<eos> Fell for it again.<eos> Do you think Injun Joe was here?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But whoever was here, they don't know where the treasure is and we do.<eos> We do.
- It's hard to buy one that's Trouble-proof.<eos> - Ona, please.<eos> - I'm trying, but I can't stop thinking about Herb and how I'll never see him again.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> It's good to have memories, but that's what he has to be right now, a memory.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> He is the only person I have left.<eos> - I didn't have anyone when I first came here.<eos> My husband died, I lost my daughter... And I was sure I'd never find her again, but...<eos> I did.
I should have.<eos> Go!<eos> Now!<eos> For you.<eos> You make a whore of me?<eos> For the babies.<eos> And Fee.<eos> I love you, Sybil.<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> But I do.
Go!<eos> Now!<eos> For you.<eos> You make a whore of me?<eos> For the babies.<eos> And Fee.<eos> I love you, Sybil.<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> But I do.<eos> I do.
Phone rang.<eos> Our son, Richard, telling us that she was in a coma.<eos> We had to hurry.<eos> And then my sister, Miriam, she's got this clock, which hasn't worked for years.<eos> Why she keeps it only God knows.<eos> Erm, anyway, it started working right after... ..right after Janet's accident it started working again until<eos> 4.20 was the time of Janet's death.<eos> Oh, tell him about the day of the funeral.<eos> Oh, he doesn't want to know about this.<eos> I do.
You rang my home and made my wife believe that it was our daughter Janet.<eos> Did I?<eos> Where's your 10 pence?<eos> Poltergeist took it again.<eos> Look, Janet, I know you're unhappy that we've produced this voice.<eos> You.<eos> I produced this voice.<eos> But it's a huge step forward.<eos> We have a name now.<eos> We do?
Look, Jamal, I listened to your stuff, and you're good, baby, but you don't have that breakout hit, okay?<eos> And you bitched out on me after you told me you was gonna come out in public, so...<eos> Just step off, all right? Your brother Hakeem blew up after Laviticus.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now there is only one thing that can compete with that, and that is a num...<eos> A song that's a hit.<eos> She my manager now, too?<eos> Porsha, please sit down.<eos> Give us some space.<eos> Every artist from Michael Jackson to Usher did songs by other people.
Carl!<eos> - Sammi says Carl put drugs on Chuckie.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Carl, if you did that, then you...<eos> It's not a question of if.<eos> There is no way Chuckie was smuggling heroin by himself.<eos> - Heroin?<eos> - What's the fuck's the matter with you?<eos> Carl, you have to do the right thing and tell the cops it was you.<eos> - No, I don't.
Yeah, yeah, I just think I should go.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing. It's not you, okay?<eos> I can't do this. I--honestly, I can't remember what it's like to feel anything but shame.<eos> Then let me help you.<eos> That's it, that's just it. I can't be helped.<eos> But I want to help you. Us meeting, that wasn't a mistake.<eos> No, it wasn't. But eventually it will be.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
No, it's for...<eos> It's to just go, Ray.<eos> It's an alternative.<eos> Go somewhere. Before we can't turn back.<eos> Whatever happens, those questions, a custody battle, it's not gonna be easy for Chad.<eos> So don't start it.<eos> The way those two investigators sounded, it's a matter of time, Ray.<eos> You put that envelope away.<eos> I'm gonna pretend like you never really thought I'd take it.<eos> I didn't.
I mean, shit, who does anymore?<eos> Mexicans? Russians?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> Who? Who has something to gain by trying to fuck with me?<eos> You think it was someone here?<eos> What's in it?<eos> What he means is what you got worth taking anymore, Frank?<eos> My associate. His name's Ben Caspere. He was into that sweet Eastern Bloc pussy you all run between clubs.<eos> So, some of you might have girls that know him.<eos> Daniel here did.
Control the sprawl. Control the flow of information.<eos> Dixon is secondary to you, staging out of Vinci.<eos> You'll be working under a Ventura detective commanding the task force.<eos> That clear to you, Detective?<eos> 10-4, Lieutenant.<eos> Just one question.<eos> Am I supposed to solve this or not?<eos> Just no surprises, Detective Velcoro.<eos> Ray accepts dualities must be effected to, uh, serve public interests.<eos> I really do.
You'll meet me in two weeks or less.<eos> El Obelisco.<eos> There's a park there.<eos> Wear a white dress.<eos> You wear a white suit with a red rose in your jacket.<eos> I'll wear a red rose in my jacket.<eos> I'll see you coming out of the crowd, a head higher than everybody else.<eos> At first I'm worried.<eos> I can't see you.<eos> But then you do.
It might have been better if he had died instantly.<eos> - So he had to avoid suffering.<eos> - You think he'll die?<eos> - No, he did not get to be in pain.<eos> - Do you want him to die?<eos> - No, I just mean ...<eos> - I can not hear you anymore.<eos> - His parents are here now.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I did not so, buddy.
Can't you fix it'?<eos> Bart.<eos> There's no point in trying to bring back what's gone.<eos> I am but a nun.<eos> Where'd you get all this money from'?<eos> Again, rude.<eos> It's family money passed down from my father.<eos> But money isn't everything, Bart, especially when you don't have anyone to share it with.<eos> You don't have any family?<eos> I did once, but not anymore.
Amy'?<eos> Do you have sugar for the coffee'?<eos> Still "Emma."<eos> It's my guilty little pleasure.<eos> Well, I see you haven't lost your Joie De vii/re.<eos> I just hope I have mine when I'm your age.<eos> So, how long were you planning on staying with us'?<eos> As long as it takes to put Jory into tiptop shape.<eos> He has a bright future ahead of him.<eos> He does.
I don't have that kind of money!<eos> Your girlfriend and her family... I'm sure they'd help you.<eos> Out of the question.<eos> Then I can only see two options. Either you tell them everything or I do.<eos> Fine.<eos> It'll be your word against mine.<eos> As you like.<eos> I'm sure they'll find my story fascinating.<eos> Wait!<eos> Don't do that.
Um, mostly other parents. People we've met over the years through Jayda.<eos> Everyone's been so kind.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Who sent these ones?<eos> Um...<eos> Jayda, do you know who sent these?<eos> Madison's mom.<eos> Stephanie?<eos> Well, it's just that, well, Erica didn't really like her.<eos> Yes, she did.
Oh, my God.<eos> What happened?<eos> - He cut her head off.<eos> - Who?<eos> This guy. Blackway.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know his first name.<eos> Richard.<eos> - You know him?<eos> - Oh, yeah, most around here do.
Denny won the cord of wood.<eos> He doesn't know what he's talking about.<eos> Good afternoon. - What the fuck is this?<eos> - What?<eos> - Who are they?<eos> - They're looking for Blackway.<eos> - He won a toaster. - He won a what?<eos> - He won that toaster oven.<eos> - No, you're right.<eos> I just didn't...
Blackway's up in the town forest.<eos> As much chance as finding Bigfoot up there.<eos> Trudy said he's got a camp near the old gold mine.<eos> - The old noisy creek logging site?<eos> - Yep, that's what she said.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Okay.<eos> You don't have to go with us.<eos> You know that?<eos> Sure, I do.
A woman that can be bought... isn't worth having.<eos> I'm partial to Italian.<eos> We agree on more than art.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> Wilson.<eos> Eat it, you little bastard.<eos> My mom wanted me to be a butcher, you know that?<eos> Oh, not the butcher story.<eos> I said, "No, Mom, I want to be a lawyer." I don't remember what I said next.<eos> No, you never do.
No, it didn't shock me.<eos> Then why'd you look away?<eos> Because I wish I had said something like that to you when we first met.<eos> I'm glad you didn't.<eos> This wine's even better than the last one.<eos> Did you pick it?<eos> I've never had it.<eos> My assistant.<eos> I said I'd be honest.<eos> You did.
What's this party?<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> Cooper's brother's turning 21 and having some friends over.<eos> You're 16.<eos> You don't trust me?<eos> When you hide things from us, it makes it a little difficult to trust you.<eos> - You hate Cooper.<eos> You'd say no.<eos> - I don't hate Cooper.<eos> - You don't?
- Yeah!<eos> Okay.<eos> - What the hell was that, Dave?<eos> - Hey...<eos> - It's time to go, John.<eos> - What the hell was that?<eos> John, it's time to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Huh? This is insane. Did he tell you that I saved his life?<eos> - Hmm? - Yeah, he did.
You expect me to say thank you?<eos> If I didn't need you alive, we wouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> So you just stand there and let me die, huh?<eos> But you couldn't kill me yourself.<eos> Is that where you draw the line?<eos> Tell me what I want to know about Fisk.<eos> You think you're different... from me?<eos> From him?<eos> But you'll get there.<eos> Sooner or later... we all do, men like us.
Sorry, Tom, I've got to go, I'll speak to you later.<eos> - What the bloody hell are you doing here?<eos> - Well, I, er...<eos> - How did you get in?<eos> - Oh, that part was quite easy.<eos> The lock on your front door...<eos> Actually, I'm not interested in that.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - You need help.<eos> - No, I don't.
I really don't see how I can help you.<eos> Well, you knew Cheryl.<eos> You were on her pub quiz team.<eos> It wasn't her team.<eos> It was my husband's.<eos> We were told that Cheryl squeezed you out.<eos> One week we lost by a point and Cheryl told Craig she had a friend who could do a better job.<eos> But Craig set up the team.<eos> Didn't he have a say?<eos> Yes, he did.
And why not?<eos> You were just across the street while her husband was off protecting his country, protecting you.<eos> I don't blame her.<eos> Elaine was alone, scared, vulnerable.<eos> You took advantage of that.<eos> Elaine?<eos> What?<eos> You just said Elaine.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Hey.<eos> You okay, buddy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because it would be totally fine if you weren't.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Can't talk about it. Um... I'm here for you if you need me.<eos> I'm ashamed.<eos> You're ashamed?<eos> What... y-you have nothing to be ashamed about.<eos> Yes, I do.
This is all i ever wanted,<eos> To have a child with the woman i love.<eos> Oh, my god. Am i really going to be a dad?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Hi. Oh, g-god!<eos> Blanca.<eos> You said i could move my things in here tonight.<eos> Right.<eos> I did.
Then it's settled.<eos> I'm innocent.<eos> Thank you so much for coming by.<eos> It's just i still don't understand<eos> The circumstances of your breakup.<eos> We didn't have a lot in common.<eos> I'm delightful, and he's a slimy, little weasel.<eos> May he rest in peace.<eos> Sounds like you didn't like him very much.<eos> I didn't.
Ernesto, por favor. I need you to release me.<eos> I understand.<eos> You feel guilty and it's breaking your heart.<eos> Yes.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And that's why i'm gonna help you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You don't want me to sign this.<eos> Yes, i do.
I know.<eos> That's why you need to stay with us,<eos> So mommy and i can keep you safe. You understand me, katy?<eos> Are you going to call me katy forever?<eos> Yes, sweetheart. That's your name now.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm friends with marisol.<eos> She sent me over.<eos> She did?
Oh, wow. I promise I'll show you a good time.<eos> [Giggles] Oh! Hands off, bitch! [Glass shatters]<eos> [Clears throat] So much for the high road.<eos> ♪ I'm so glad we're doing this.<eos> You know, maybe we can make this a regular thing.<eos> [Chuckles] Maybe.<eos> So, Doug, how did you meet this beautiful lady?<eos> - Well...<eos> - You don't want to hear about that.<eos> Yes, I do.
None taken.<eos> I know how close you were, and I'm sorry she had to go.<eos> Well, it isn't your fault.<eos> You see, dear, Zoila and I had a certain rapport.<eos> She always gave me her brutally honest opinion.<eos> You want me to be more like her?<eos> Exactly.<eos> And it's a two-way street.<eos> You can tell me my dress is ugly, and I can tell you that I don't like your hairstyle.<eos> You don't?
Really? [Sighs]<eos> I can't handle this house all alone right now.<eos> I could really use some help.<eos> Of course.<eos> Here, I just finished sweeping, but I can't get down on the floor to scoop up the dirt.<eos> Would you mind?<eos> Not at all.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sweeping.<eos> I just did that part.
As in that Roy guy?<eos> (Scoffs) Yeah, you're funny.<eos> They've no history with your dad, good or bad.<eos> They like money, they know drugs, and I'm pretty sure they never sleep.<eos> Be like having your own army.<eos> You wouldn't have to share with anybody.<eos> So butano and kovic are in business together.<eos> What happens when they start to wonder what's in it for you?<eos> Don't you have work to do?<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
There won't be nothing to hold on to, nothing to lean on.<eos> We're gonna look all the way inside, and see if we can work out what we are doing here!<eos> Two smiley faces, each.<eos> Get 'em from little Jess.<eos> Lock down what needs to be locked down, and then prepare to fall into the hole.<eos> Two tabs, isn't that a lot?<eos> We don't usually take that much.<eos> I've never taken two at once.<eos> No, please, Charlie, he said he'd be back,<eos> Elliot did.
- Yeah.<eos> The malar and the superciliary ridge formations are consistent.<eos> Meaning?<eos> I think this is your victim.<eos> DNA comparison with the sister should confirm it.<eos> You asked me before if I had faith.<eos> I remember.<eos> I told you I didn't.<eos> That wasn't the truth.<eos> I do.
You're back already? Yeah.<eos> My mom got me off the hook.<eos> Sometimes the Blake name comes in handy.<eos> So, I guess we're like, cut from the heist crew, huh?<eos> No way, you guys did great.<eos> You're you're clearly delirious from your time in jail.<eos> I mean, we botched the plan.<eos> You were arrested.<eos> It just happened.<eos> So did this.
Stay away from the walls!<eos> Do not let them count our numbers!<eos> Let them think we have thousands of warriors!<eos> Gather a few men.<eos> Let's see what the pig eaters are up to.<eos> You're wanted in the armory.<eos> My love!<eos> My love.<eos> The warriors need your help.<eos> They do?
Wha-- what happened to you?<eos> Where--I'm fine.<eos> No!<eos> God damn it.<eos> You have disappointed us, Adam.<eos> Chancellor, i can explain.<eos> We'll be back in a minute.<eos> I just have to reset.<eos> You know how vital the neural connections are to us.<eos> I do.
I told you, she can't be trusted.<eos> Oh, I have no loyalty to Rochefort, the man is insane.<eos> - I'll give you what you want.<eos> -With a hefty price tag, no doubt.<eos> Well, what else would you expect from a woman like me?<eos> You disgust me.<eos> Meanwhile, the King is bouncing another man's child on his knee.<eos> Your morality will not stand, Musketeer.<eos> How do we know you won't betray us?<eos> You don't.
You're beautiful. And you are a truly good friend.<eos> Karen...<eos> Don't go.<eos> Joss and I had a fight. She was emotional and I was... kind of a jerk.<eos> I-I'm telling you. I never got your text.<eos> How many more times do you want me to say it?<eos> No, but you can clearly see that I sent it, right?<eos> And when a text doesn't go through, you get that little red exclamation thingie,<eos> - which, as you can see...<eos> - You did not.
Karen...<eos> Don't go.<eos> Joss and I had a fight. She was emotional and I was... kind of a jerk.<eos> I-I'm telling you.

You really didn't have to go to so much trouble.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> After you went so out of your way to be so sweet to me and Lucy?<eos> Plus, I love sushi, too.<eos> I mean, the rules, the rituals, the beauty of the presentation.<eos> Did you know that when you're not using your chopsticks, you should place them in front of you, parallel to the edge of the sushi bar with the narrow end in the hashi oki?<eos> That's what this cute little thing is called... hashi oki.<eos> I googled it.<eos> I never knew that.<eos> Well, now you do.
I feel like you're stalling or something.<eos> I'm not stalling.<eos> Well, you're not being very proactive about the relationship.<eos> I mean, look, like, [Chuckles]<eos> Scott's already engaged, and we can't even share a sink.<eos> Tell me you didn't just bring Scott in this conversation.<eos> No, I'm just trying to explain...<eos> Did you get closure when you met with him today?<eos> I told you I was going to see him.<eos> That, you did.
It's...<eos> It's so nice to meet you.<eos> Mm. I wish that I could stay, but I...<eos> - You've got things.<eos> I know.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Totally get it, by the way.<eos> I like her.<eos> Everyone does.
[Sniffs]<eos> Oh, my God! This candle smells delicious.<eos> Do you sell these here?<eos> What?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> You're not... you're not supposed to be in tonight.<eos> Uh, this is true.<eos> You know.<eos> I do.
We're on!<eos> Need any help?<eos> I'm almost done.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, I was talking to Lucy, and she really does feel bad, so maybe you could ease up on her a little?<eos> Mom, we had a nice day.<eos> Let's not mess it up, okay?<eos> I understand why you're upset.<eos> I do. But...
A one-time thing. It's not about you, Harry.<eos> She's overwhelmed.<eos> How -- how can I help?<eos> I want to help.<eos> I know you do, but you can't right now.<eos> You're only going to make her more upset.<eos> Well, I can't just sit here and do nothing.<eos> I'm taking care of her. I promise.<eos> So, you had a key to the house. Yes.<eos> But a lot of people did.
I knew he was gonna marry her.<eos> And he did.<eos> Did -- did they have any, uh, problems in their marriage that you know of?<eos> No.<eos> Even though I didn't like her, he -- he loved her.<eos> He was happy.<eos> That's the thing -- the police said my son killed himself.<eos> Now, why would a happy man take his own life?<eos> - It makes no sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
I'm so sorry.<eos> It is what it is, but I have always wanted to be a mother, and I think I'd be a pretty damn good one, too.<eos> So do I.<eos> But I'm not an idiot, Karen.<eos> I know there's none of me in there.<eos> I've got no genetic material in the mix.<eos> That's not what I think, and you know it.<eos> This baby was conceived out of love by all of us.<eos> It's as much yours as it is mine... if you want to be a part of its life.<eos> I do.
You're good.<eos> Do you have a problem with me?<eos> Uh, no, not personally.<eos> Because I'm doing a good job.<eos> Whether you understand it or not, I am helping Joss.<eos> You messing with Joss's head...<eos> That's hurting her.<eos> I'm not messing with her head.<eos> No, no, you're trying to control a situation in which you have no control...<eos> Except you do.
- Yes.<eos> I just got excited.<eos> Yeah, I saw that.<eos> Oh, God, I just...<eos> Oh, baby, I think after everything that's happened,<eos> I-I... really, I just want to attack life.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You want to talk about what's happened?<eos> No, I do not.
What was wrong with this one?<eos> Well, you know, when you go on these things, usually you start off with a cute anecdote about yourself.<eos> I use the one about nursing a baby bird back to health.<eos> That was me!<eos> I did that!<eos> Well, I took it.<eos> It's a big hit, actually, should you want to start dating.<eos> Anyway, this guy's anecdote was about his fatty lipoma.<eos> - I don't know what that is.<eos> - Oh, I didn't either.
Thanks.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> You ready to send your first Tweet?<eos> Yes, I am, Mike.<eos> And you're sure you want to make it that profane?<eos> Abso-fucking-lutely.<eos> Bring the cursor up to the blue button and three, two, one, click it.<eos> Did you get it? Did you get it? !<eos> Yeah!<eos> The whole world did.
There must have been a dozen witnesses.<eos> [ chuckles ] Why don't i give you a minute?<eos> No.<eos> Stay.<eos> There's going to be another murder.<eos> And the doctor says if everything goes good, I can go home in a couple of days.<eos> Oh! Thank god, because the lighting here does nothing for me.<eos> Yes, your coma has been so inconvenient for carmen.<eos> [ chuckles ] Well, anyway, i have a little announcement.<eos> You do?
And now she's the one who's knocked up?<eos> Maybe you should just be happy for her.<eos> You know, if it wasn't for my mom, We would've had a lot of sex by now.<eos> A lot.<eos> Trying not to think about that.<eos> My father would be so upset about this.<eos> I think he'd probably be more upset That you and your mom are fighting.<eos> She forbid my marriage before i forbid hers.<eos> I thought you liked javi.<eos> I do.
I thought you said you were cool with me and Jamie canoodling.<eos> I am cool with it.<eos> It's just weird having your best friend. Hook up with your brother.<eos> Ross flipped his lid when he found out Chandler was dating Monica.<eos> Wait. What?<eos> Monica and Chandler start dating?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> You are the worst time traveler ever.<eos> You tell me everything I don't want to know.<eos> And nothing I do.
Okay, if you're in a shitty place and you feel like you gotta lash out, I get that, but I am not the enemy here so back the fuck off.<eos> You heard the lady.<eos> She doesn't wanna go home with you.<eos> - Mind your business, dumbass.<eos> - Did you just call me a dumbass?<eos> Bartender, can you serve this melon-head some IQ points?<eos> Sean.<eos> What?<eos> You got a real mouth on you, pal.<eos> Most humans with a face do.
How did you get past security?<eos> I bought a $69 ticket to Atlantic City. Paige, you don't have to go.<eos> They arrested Alison for killing Mona.<eos> She's in jail. She won't stay there.<eos> Yes, she will.<eos> Tell your parents, they have to let you stay.<eos> It's safe now.<eos> Emily, I have to go.<eos> Listen to me, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Thanks.<eos> Gosh, these are nice. - Very stylish.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's see what your diploma says.<eos> Do you want to marry me?<eos> I was thinking... you might want us to...<eos> Now, do it calmly and clearly...<eos> Do you want to marry me? Yes!<eos> - What?<eos> - Yes, I do!
There is no Lip Gallagher on my class list.<eos> Right, no, yeah, there was a slight hiccup with Financial Aid.<eos> But, you know, I wanted to hit the ground running for when it gets sorted out.<eos> You're interested in Postmodern Thought?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Yeah. Yeah. And also, a lot of the other classes were already full so it was between this and Environmental Studies...<eos> - ...and hippies don't use deodorant, so...<eos> - Do you even know what critical theory is?<eos> - Is that a trick question?<eos> - You don't, do you?
Look at me.<eos> The three of us have a secret.<eos> I don't want to go.<eos> Don't forget it.<eos> We, the grownups, have to work.<eos> And you have to go to school and learn french.<eos> You need to speak the language with the other children.<eos> Otherwise, we'll have to go back to Sri Lanka.<eos> Do you want to go back there?<eos> Do you?
I'm sorry!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Is this loaded? - Uh... no.<eos> The money! Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here. That's all there is, I swear.<eos> Your son stole 150 grand from us.<eos> If you don't tell me where the money is and I end up finding it in this house, I swear to God... the two of you are gonna be begging me to shoot you.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> ! Do you? !
And I killed him.<eos> I just watched the life go out of him.<eos> We didn't catch the other guy.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> What the hell am I doing?<eos> I don't even know what my job is anymore.<eos> It's all bullshit.<eos> Do you want to leave?<eos> Do you want to take your dad up on his offer?<eos> Only if you do.
Beating him is not protection, Tony.<eos> That's getting payback.<eos> Who protected you when you were smoking in the backyard, huh?<eos> Who hid your beers and lied for you, huh?<eos> So only protect you from papi but nobody else?<eos> I beat his ass for you.<eos> Don't you blame me.<eos> And I'll do it again.<eos> Did he say anything?<eos> He... didn't.
Well, it's not up to me.<eos> You're gonna have to ask Tom and Eve.<eos> Yeah, we're not on real good terms.<eos> I was... I was hoping you could ask for me.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just let it go.<eos> Okay? It's over for you here.<eos> I'm not leaving again.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't.
No, boy, this place ain't for you and me.<eos> It's good to have dreams, just so long as they're not fantasies.<eos> You let anybody sell you that shit, it's your own damn fault.<eos> - You hear me?<eos> - Yeah, I hear you, Pop.<eos> I'll get it to the House right away.<eos> - Green light on the release?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I don't remember giving you my phone number.<eos> You didn't. Your publisher did.
This early, huh?<eos> I'm gonna be up three straight days once this hurricane hits.<eos> I need to get all the sleep I can.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I'll leave you be.<eos> Have one of the stewards wake me when it hits the coast.<eos> Francis.<eos> Francis?<eos> Where did it make landfall?<eos> - It didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> Y-yeah, I'm sure!<eos> We have an issue.<eos> This wasn't the gun that was used to kill Matt Skokie.<eos> This also is not the gun that was in Carter Nix's possession when he was arrested.<eos> Do you understand what the problem is, Hector?<eos> I mean, um, it looked like the gun.<eos> No, it didn't.
I'd be drinking, having guys over when papi was at work.<eos> And I told Tony not to tell on me.<eos> Tony was always looking out for me...<eos> Making sure I didn't get busted.<eos> That's how he is.<eos> He just wants everybody to be happy.<eos> When me and papi would fight, it would really bother Tony.<eos> So, to keep things cool, he would lie for me.<eos> I didn't know I was making Tony feel like he had to protect me all the time.<eos> But he did.
Eyes and ears sharp.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh... no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Oh, God, ah... -(Pants unzipping) -Ah!<eos> Hurt me.<eos> Hurt... Me.<eos> How?<eos> You're the boss... This time. Markham:<eos> So... You got a boyfriend?<eos> No, I don't.
Regular for you would be staying out of trouble for six months.<eos> Regular for you would be buying a decent shirt and going to work on the first day.<eos> Why you always trying to make it so big?<eos> Why can't you just please try to do some regular... Okay?<eos> It's all gonna work.<eos> It's all gonna work out.<eos> Come on, papi.<eos> Eat it.<eos> I came here because you and I actually have a lot in common.<eos> We do?
Turnips and mangelwurzels. 12 hours a day.<eos> Still, it's scarcely the Somme.<eos> Good God!<eos> Let me have a look at you.<eos> Hooves.<eos> Splendid.<eos> Fetlocks?<eos> - Good. Teeth?<eos> - I lost one.<eos> Ah, so you did.
Makarov.<eos> Keep an eye out for her, if she follows the path of her father...<eos> You understand, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> You should always have a new tactic against him.<eos> Never the same rifle.<eos> Each rifle has a character.<eos> You need to understand and handle the rifle as you would your wife.<eos> Do you have a wife, Captain?<eos> No, I do not.
But how long do you think you can hold out?<eos> If you come down, we will make it quick.<eos> You have my word.<eos> All right, then!<eos> Let's make it quick!<eos> 'We are here' to establish the facts of the Queen's infidelity.<eos> You are accused of seducing the Queen at the convent in Bourbon-les-Eaux.<eos> And of fathering her child.<eos> Do you swear to give us the truth of this sordid encounter?<eos> I do.
Born?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, when you were a baby.<eos> Baby.<eos> You know, like, goo-goo, mama, itty-bitty baby shit.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Monster, do you know where babies come from?<eos> Does he know anything?<eos> He does. He does.
What were the yards like?<eos> Big... fenced, with trees. Why?<eos> If this pilgrim feels a special relationship with the moon, he might like to go outside and look at it, before he tidies himself up.<eos> If one were nude, say, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for that sort of thing.<eos> One must show some consideration for the neighbours.<eos> Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight, Will?<eos> It appears quite black.<eos> You've come to wag your finger?<eos> I love a good finger-wagging.<eos> Yes, you do.
You haven't said anything since I mentioned speech therapy.<eos> I understand you because you speak very well and because I listen.<eos> People don't pay attention.<eos> If you don't want to talk, OK, but I hope that you do talk because you can and because I'm interested in what you have to say. Uh-huh.<eos> That's good.<eos> Here's what I like, Francis.<eos> I've felt no sympathy from you.<eos> I like that.<eos> Sympathy feels like spit on my cheek.<eos> And I don't do self-pity.

If a salacious story is a motive, she could be your killer.<eos> Elaine Henshaw, whom you already know, is a nervous sort.<eos> She seems to be in fear of her roommate,<eos> Beatrice Crawford.<eos> The new leader.<eos> Crawford?<eos> As in...<eos> Yes, her brother, Eddie Crawford, who fences their stolen goods.<eos> And you believe Beatrice Crawford has the strongest motive.<eos> I do.
- And?<eos> - It was charcoal, sulphur, and saltpeter.<eos> Gunpowder.<eos> Likely dragged into the wound from traces found on Miss White's clothing?<eos> No.<eos> The residue was found only at the insertion point of the knife.<eos> It must have been transferred to the wound by the knife itself.<eos> So the killer was holding the knife in close proximity when he fired the gun.<eos> - That looks rather awkward.<eos> - It certainly does.
She's a cop.<eos> Howard and roberts are out their fuc...<eos> They're out of control.<eos> I'm gonna get 'em, marty.<eos> And when I do, I'm gonna tear their fucking heads off.<eos> No, you don't, ethan. No, you don't.<eos> That is a bad idea.<eos> That is a really bad idea right now.<eos> -I don't give a shit.<eos> -Yes, you do.

- Ciao, chica.<eos> (IN FRENCH) The judge wants results.<eos> Let me do the talking, OK?<eos> (IN FRENCH) So we've got nothing?<eos> I wouldn't say nothing.<eos> Interpol were pleased to have the killer's weapon.<eos> With untraceable prints?<eos> Doesn't seem much use to me.<eos> - We have faces of all the attackers.<eos> - So does the world.
I slept with someone.<eos> You're making this up.<eos> I wish I was.<eos> I caught them together.<eos> Tell him what it felt like, Neil.<eos> Tell me.<eos> My whole world exploded in that moment.<eos> I hated you.<eos> And I wanted to kill the son of a bitch she was with.<eos> I really did.
Just feels like what I should do right now.<eos> - Will?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Take the cookie.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> "Why does life suck..." Double underline... "So hard?"<eos> Any thoughts?<eos> Because people are selfish and petty.<eos> I love that passion, but no.<eos> It doesn't?
Yeah?<eos> Are you going to the wedding?<eos> I'm not sure that's such a good idea.<eos> Dad, do you hate Mom?<eos> - Of course not, Clio.<eos> - Colette says you hate her.<eos> I love your mother.<eos> Does she love you?<eos> Yeah, I think, you know, in a way, yeah.<eos> Sure, yeah, she does.
What's this to do with then?<eos> This is about the fact that you asked my daughter to skip your class so that she could baby-sit your kids.<eos> I'm sorry, I was in a desperate situation this morning.<eos> But you didn't think to ask any of your male students for help? Are you kidding?<eos> My male students are idiots.<eos> So, the idiots get to go to class while the bright girl stays at home and takes care of your kids?<eos> What kind of message does that send to Kat?<eos> Or to your daughters, for that matter?<eos> - I'm sorry, I just didn't think...<eos> - Yeah, guys never do.
Their lives have never been chaotic with me.<eos> It's my life that's been chaotic because I was unhappy for years and didn't do anything about it.<eos> Because first I was taking care of you, and then I was taking care of them... And no one was ever taking care of me!<eos> Well, I'm sorry I didn't know you wanted to take improv classes.<eos> - Fuck you! - Charlie...<eos> I could be so much more than what I am.<eos> What does that mean? I don't even know what that means.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> God!<eos> Of course you don't! God!
Do you like her?<eos> I told you, I barely know her.<eos> I think you like her.<eos> Dad, who are you texting?<eos> - No one.<eos> - Is it Kat?<eos> No, it's not Kat.<eos> This is a really nice office.<eos> Yeah, I thought you would like it.<eos> I do.
Yeah, well. Whatever.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> Yeah, did you talk to Gary?<eos> Yeah actually, I did.<eos> Good, good, I think we were able to work through most of his doubts.<eos> Did you tell him about the kiss?<eos> I didn't tell him that. - What?<eos> - Why would I tell him that?<eos> Why not, why didn't you?
Yeah, I just got them.<eos> You look good.<eos> There are people looking for you.<eos> And only you know where to find me.<eos> It kind of helped that you texted me where you were.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm afraid I'm making another mistake.<eos> I don't think of what we did as a mistake.<eos> It didn't work out.<eos> It did...
Good afternoon, do you have something for me to eat?<eos> It's been three days since I've eaten.<eos> Anyway to get a meal to go for me?<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> I don't want money, I'm just hungry.<eos> It's been three days since I've eaten.<eos> I don't have anything, man.<eos> You don't have anything?<eos> A coin, anything?<eos> No I don't.
Leave me....alone.<eos> Leave...<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm going to stay.<eos> It'll pass. I'm going to stay here with you.<eos> You don't need to see this.<eos> No, no.<eos> I want to.<eos> You don't need to see this, Mom.<eos> You really don't.
- It's not for us to judge.<eos> - What else is there to do?<eos> - Do you recall the favor I asked?<eos> - Of course.<eos> The King asked for time alone in the chapel this afternoon.<eos> Perhaps today is a good day to thank God for our victory.<eos> Hmm, lucky me.<eos> To have a friend like you, the luck is all mine.<eos> - Cassel will come.<eos> - And if he does not, Sire?
It'll look a little conspicuous where we're going next.<eos> Mm. I was analyzing the particulates that Clay Parker and Shawna Baez left behind, and I found something very interesting.<eos> When Clay's cells come into contact with Shawna's, they adopt her properties.<eos> Something bothering you?<eos> Why would you ask that?<eos> You're doing that biting-your-lower-lip thing that you do when something's bothering you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cisco says I don't have a life.<eos> You don't, do you?<eos> I do!
Paris, in France - wow.<eos> That's exciting.<eos> The only French I know is..<eos> ...half a grapefruit.<eos> - Um, you have some ketchup on your nose.<eos> - I'm sorry, what?<eos> - Ketchup. - Oh!<eos> I put ketchup on my ketchup.<eos> - Those shoes look like they would hurt a lot.<eos> - Yeah, they do.
- Fine!<eos> - Hey, you, and just put..<eos> Could you please put 40 bucks in the kitty before you leave?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Hello, again.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> Do you have rooms available for one night?<eos> - One night?<eos> Yes, I do.
I used to have to carry my inhaler everywhere.<eos> Now asthma's gone.<eos> My-my uncle... worst drunk you ever saw.<eos> Clean and sober, like poof.<eos> And beyond all that, everyone's acting weird.<eos> Everyone's getting along, all kum-bah-yah.<eos> Everyone's talking about moving on and whatnot.<eos> You saw her, man.<eos> I know you saw her.<eos> Okay, and what if I did?
Keep going.<eos> Julia?<eos> Junior?<eos> Junior?<eos> Did you speak with him?<eos> How are you, Sam?<eos> I'm well.<eos> As well as can be expected.<eos> Day by day, you know?<eos> I do.
Trapped?<eos> Why would you even think that?<eos> Dale...<eos> I jumped into this relationship with both feet.<eos> You seem to have one foot in the past with Julia and the other foot in the future with me, and... I want to be with you.<eos> I want to have this baby.<eos> What I feel for you... is real.<eos> And this baby is real.<eos> I know what I want.<eos> But do you?
- Oh...<eos> - Those headaches again?<eos> We'll run some scans in the morning.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, Dave...<eos> Dave...<eos> Can you take me back to my room? Sure, sure.<eos> So, does Molly want a bedtime story?<eos> - Yes, I do. - Mm.
We need a recess.<eos> - I want to change my plea.<eos> - Again?<eos> This is dizzying, your honor.<eos> I plead guilty and confess to the murder of father Bernard.<eos> Your honor, I'd like to ask for an immediate mistrial.<eos> Because you had your client cause one?<eos> No, the state happily accepts father Crawford's plea.<eos> Your honor, he doesn't know what he's saying.<eos> I do, too, your honor.
Dude, I'm...<eos> I'm totally down with our rainbow coalition, but I don't need to know all the details of your sexy times.<eos> Connor.<eos> Enough of this, okay?<eos> I get it... you want to know if she didn't do this.<eos> We all do, but sometimes you just...<eos> Have to accept not knowing.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> You have no other choice.<eos> I do.
Spit it out, psycho.<eos> You killed Lila, right?<eos> And you played Waitlist here like... like some loser.<eos> - Played all of us.<eos> - Why are you letting them do this?<eos> No, you're not gonna get to manipulate your way out of this one.<eos> - I didn't manipulate anyone!<eos> - But you lied!<eos> - You said you didn't know this Rudy guy.<eos> - I didn't.
Now, can you focus, or should I go ask the cute guy next door for help?<eos> No.<eos> Homeboy needs no help in the snack-attack department. Mm.<eos> I was afraid you'd think I hurt her.<eos> But I could never do that.<eos> You know me.<eos> So I skipped my lecture, came back to see her, but I couldn't find her.<eos> She stopped answering her phone.<eos> I lied, yes, but only because I was afraid you'd think I killed her.<eos> Didn't you?
I know how messed up all this is, but I am here now. And after now?<eos> When you go home to her?<eos> I'm alone again, having a baby all by myself.<eos> You don't have to do this, Lila.<eos> You're 21 years old...<eos> I want this baby even if you don't.<eos> - So stop trying to change my mind.<eos> - I'm not going to.<eos> You said you loved me over and over.<eos> But you don't, do you?

Look at me.<eos> Look at what you did to me.<eos> You said you loved me.<eos> - I still do. - [Scoffs]<eos> I told you everything about me.<eos> Every awful thing anyone has ever done to me.<eos> But you know what?<eos> You're the worst one.<eos> 'Cause I didn't know I had to be afraid of you.<eos> You don't.
- Oh, babe.<eos> - What?<eos> Have you seen my Billy Ocean t-shirt?<eos> What?<eos> ! That's it!<eos> Feel free to remarry, and find the kids a good dad. Aah! Are we a bad couple for going at it like that?<eos> - I mean, we went ballistic.<eos> - Face it, babe.<eos> We're both strong-ass cups of tea who do not like to back down.<eos> - No, we do not. - Mnh-mnh.
- Yo!<eos> Yo! Yo, party people!<eos> I go by the name of Jermaine Dupri, and it's time that we give a big shout-out to my man, Dre Johnson!<eos> - What's up?<eos> - What up, J.D.?<eos> Hey, give me a second, Zo-Zo, okay?<eos> Happy Birthday, Dre.<eos> Thanks, J.D.<eos> You know I danced for Whodini, right?<eos> Uh... Yes, I did.
My first wife was a bit of an enabler.<eos> It ended with my boys trying to to Menendez me.<eos> Duct-taped me to the fridge and beat me with a bag of clementines - to get my bank codes. - Wow.<eos> We were taught to, uh, respect our parents. Right, Charlie?<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> Except Eustace kinda runs the show at my house.<eos> I lost the moral high ground once I bought a jet ski in his name<eos> - and ruined his credit.<eos> - You own a jet ski?<eos> Technically, he does.

And I think this says "I'm harmless," you know, forgettable.<eos> Are you okay, pops?<eos> My daddy told me there ain't but three things in life a black man's got to do... stay black, pay taxes, and die.<eos> I got to say, the black-man rules don't seem too hard.<eos> The I.R.S. came after my daddy, scared his black ass white as a ghost.<eos> Wouldn't let the poor man die until he paid what he owed.<eos> Poor bastard lived to be 126.<eos> 126!<eos> Pops, I think you're gonna be fine.<eos> - You do?
I like your sweater.<eos> I find it oddly comforting.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You got some schmutz on the side of...<eos> This is so, so creepy.<eos> Listen, your mom was thinking maybe we could go to the dance together.<eos> - Oh, I don't know what...<eos> - So you already have a date?<eos> Not really.<eos> Well, you do now.
He can get downcourt as quick as anyone that I've ever...<eos> What's up, boy?<eos> You good?<eos> You want some breakfast?<eos> No, I want that shit you've been holding for me.<eos> - Still got it after all these years?<eos> - I just might.<eos> Let me go see.<eos> Your mama got the best ass in New York City.<eos> Always did.
I didn't touch your girl!<eos> She ain't even my type!<eos> - What the fuck does that mean?<eos> - Tommy!<eos> I don't fucking need you alienating our right fucking hand over some bitch.<eos> Call Holly a bitch again.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Tommy, alls I'm saying, man, is you're about to do Julio and do me over some broad you don't trust. - I trust her!<eos> - You don't.<eos> No, you don't.
- Look, I didn't tell you because...<eos> - Because you're loyal to Ghost.<eos> No, because I didn't want to be the one to break your heart.<eos> You were thinking of my feelings, huh?<eos> Well, you might be the only one.<eos> I can't take anyone else lying to me.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to tell you one other thing.<eos> If this is about Keisha, I know.<eos> You do?
What you mean, don't yell at you?<eos> Somebody at India's job was taping us.<eos> India?<eos> You my girl.<eos> You ain't supposed to be kissing no damn India chick, and you know that.<eos> So, if it was a dude, it would've been all right?<eos> I'm not saying that.<eos> You got a sidepiece too.<eos> - Hakeem got a sidepiece?<eos> - Yes, he does.
You're asking me to commit fraud.<eos> Can you please watch your voice, sir?<eos> You're asking me to risk losing my license, lose my hospital.<eos> That's criminal.<eos> You're just a thug.<eos> Dr. Calhoun, if the IPO goes through and I die,<eos> Anika will become a billionaire in her own right.<eos> But it will not happen if I can't get... A key man policy.<eos> Does Anika know about this?<eos> No, she does not.
Is it amazing?<eos> Well, I don't usually like to brag, but...<eos> Just tell us what you found, yeah?<eos> The face on the body was completely caved in. Which wasn't surprising, since hitting the water from 100 feet up is pretty much the same as hitting cement.<eos> I thought that was a myth.<eos> No, the kinetic energy is actually...<eos> Who cares about the face?<eos> All right? The DNA is all that matters.<eos> How'd they screw this one up?<eos> They didn't.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you remember him?<eos> I'm sure he means well, but you need to be with people who accept you for who you are.<eos> And they're out there.<eos> You should never apologize for being you.<eos> You, Ian.<eos> I love you.<eos> Should we dance on the tables?<eos> Well, it's an option, but I know what you really want.<eos> You do?

There's no sign of a break-in.<eos> No sign of a break-in!<eos> No, he knocked, I answered, he put a gun in my face.<eos> - And what was his name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Of course you know it. - What was his name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You're sure? - Yes.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Yes, you do.
- Him, there.<eos> What was his name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Mimo.<eos> Fréderic Mimo. You don't know who he is?<eos> - No.<eos> - Everyone called him Mimo.<eos> You don't know him? And you?<eos> You know him? - No.<eos> - You don't?
- MOKHTAR: Don't turn around.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> Hello, brother.<eos> I'm in deep shit, and you know it.<eos> - What does Roman do for you?<eos> - He gives us information.<eos> Like which flats we'll raid in Les Agnettes?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> - How much do you pay him?<eos> - We don't.
She said she might come. What else could I do? Leave her there?<eos> Get moving, get out of there.<eos> - Move. You can do it.<eos> - Milan...<eos> - I'm sorry, this is my fault.<eos> - Milan.<eos> - Yes. - MAN:<eos> Why didn't you pick up?<eos> - I thought I'd found him.<eos> - Did you?
We are living in a great age of freedom, where we are thrust into smaller and smaller places, in order to indulge in one of the few great pleasures left in life.<eos> Smoking.<eos> Sadly, my chest won't allow it.<eos> This is simply an exercise in nostalgia.<eos> You're on this fucking balcony for nostalgic reasons?<eos> I do miss it dreadfully.<eos> So... Your boy failed.<eos> He was no boy.<eos> He was my friend.<eos> And yes, he did.
Not for a moment.<eos> You any closer to finding the Arch bishop's killer?<eos> We believe there to be a connection to the Red Guard.<eos> He might even be inside the palace itself.<eos> Dear God, someone close to the King is a traitor.<eos> It's possible.<eos> No harm will come to you.<eos> You have my word.<eos> She told me she would wear it always.<eos> Who did?
Out of the way!<eos> Constance...<eos> My apologies, monsieur.<eos> It is I who must apologise.<eos> I thought you were my wife, Madame Bonacieux.<eos> Ah, you are Constance's husband.<eos> I am Bonacieux, the finest cloth merchant in Paris.<eos> Then it's you I'm looking for.<eos> She asked me to tell you she will meet you at home.<eos> - She did?
Should be big enough for us to be able to steam roll our way back into camp.<eos> Pope and I will start loading it up.<eos> - You guys keep working here.<eos> - This one's good to go.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> There you go.<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> Why won't you fly, damn you?<eos> You, doing okay over there?
Eachconcealssomething.<eos> Did you not hiding anything?<eos> Aykut, get out!<eos> Did you wrote it?<eos> Come to us you married?<eos> Bravo, bravo, bravo.<eos> Great!<eos> Only the bride miss.<eos> And where there is the bride?<eos> What did with Defne?
You have a lover.<eos> It's only to be expected.<eos> Hilda!<eos> I hear Clifford has become totally absorbed in coal mining.<eos> You can't expect that to be sufficient fire.<eos> Hilda.<eos> You haven't denied it.<eos> Promise not to tell.<eos> Cross your heart.<eos> You do.
Good-bye, john.<eos> Good luck.<eos> This is where anne marie found him.<eos> Even if we get in, i'm still not sure What we'll be able to do for him.<eos> John's more prepared than even i realized.<eos> You're gonna have to sneak a couple things in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Assyrian exorcism rite.<eos> How did he know he'd need that exact spell?<eos> He didn't.
Where you going?<eos> Can't catch me!<eos> Lol, get back here!<eos> Can't catch me!<eos> Come back here, Lol!<eos> So what shall we do now then, Jo?<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Go on - you tell.<eos> No.<eos> You do it.
When... when did you find out?<eos> Nine years ago.<eos> "Nine years ago."<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm strong.<eos> Strong motherfucker.<eos> That's right.<eos> You know what matrix tortuosity is?<eos> I-I do not, no.<eos> No one does.
I don't know.<eos> Where did I go wrong?<eos> First you stole her phone, and then...<eos> Yes, I know that.<eos> I'm talking about in general.<eos> How did it all come to this?<eos> I think he is right.<eos> You should call the police.<eos> Hey... I saw it on television.<eos> Everybody did.
You two look good together.<eos> Babies bring out the juices in a man.<eos> I should see him at your breast.<eos> I'm going to head to the mine.<eos> See what nonsense them people are up to...<eos> The lord is my Shepherd, therefore can I lack nothing.<eos> He shall feed me in a green pasture and lead me forth beside the waters of comfort...<eos> They will be happy to have you.<eos> But I do not believe.<eos> It does the soul good, regardless.
You'd covet it dearly.<eos> Something to pray on...<eos> Say your hail Mary's to.<eos> Oh! I'm sorry.<eos> I'm a fool.<eos> I'm going to make Slotter pay for every broken bone, for every man left dead in that mine.<eos> He's broken up bad still.<eos> He will heal.<eos> Robin said the angel of death was down there with him, hovering for his take.<eos> I did not.
He's broken up bad still.<eos> He will heal.<eos> Robin said the angel of death was down there with him, hovering for his take.<eos> I did not.<eos> Shush you both.<eos> Go to Rebecca's.<eos> See if you can be of use.<eos> Thought I'd have seen you a couple of days ago.<eos> Word of the mine must not have got to you.<eos> It did.
You are involved.<eos> See that these are delivered.<eos> I have put good money into this mine of ours, John.<eos> Hired men at full wage to dig out that caved-in tunnel, brought and paid for new timber.<eos> No fraud, no bribes paid.<eos> A genuine investment.<eos> Real capital torn from your pockets, like flesh from bone.<eos> Which deserves consideration.<eos> I should like, indeed, require that consideration... you have already 25%.<eos> I do.
Don't look like no gut-shot to me.<eos> Was what happened next.<eos> The man pulled his heart out of his very chest.<eos> How's that?<eos> How he did it.<eos> Cut right through it.<eos> Clean cut.<eos> Was a nurse tended him after, made it so.<eos> Didn't suffer then?<eos> He did.
It's a new dawn.<eos> Yeah, like that.<eos> She's not wrong, you know?<eos> City's changing.<eos> You really want Falcone's job?<eos> Since we were kids, I love you like a brother.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Always.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do, I do.
- I have no idea.<eos> - A rhetorical question.<eos> You're in there because I put you in there.<eos> But, Don Maroni, why?<eos> What did I do?<eos> Do you know what hubris is?<eos> Do you know?<eos> ! Sorry.<eos> I thought that was another... rhetorical... question.<eos> Yes, I do.
Thank you.<eos> But I need to see her first.<eos> Before I sign anything, I need to know she's all right.<eos> She's fine.<eos> I need to see her.<eos> Or no deal.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> How long have you known Fish Mooney?<eos> I don't.
Let me say it in Spanish:<eos> No.<eos> Okay, look, you're right.<eos> I'm ambitious.<eos> I want to show people around here that things are gonna change.<eos> But, Harvey, I can't do that without your help.<eos> Look, I know you're riding high, what with getting over on Loeb and all.<eos> But there's one thing you should always remember:<eos> Fly too close to the sun, you're gonna get burned.<eos> - You done?
I had a really good time with you last night.<eos> And... I hope that I get to see you again.<eos> At least, uh..., have some breakfast.<eos> Oh, I still have to go home and change and I am so late.<eos> Next time.<eos> Call me tonight.<eos> I can come over after work, if you want.<eos> Oh, Jason..., please, I really have to go.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Are you dangerous?<eos> I don't know... is your boyfriend gonna come home?<eos> I never said I had a boyfriend.<eos> I assumed a woman as beautiful as you...<eos> You assumed I had a boyfriend and you assumed I would be the kind of woman who would cheat on him.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> And I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> And if a bus hit me tomorrow, no one would care.<eos> That change things?<eos> - Yes, actually, it does.
I need to know where the Foxglove is.<eos> And I need an invitation.<eos> Well, someone's in a mood.<eos> Can you help me out?<eos> Yes or no.<eos> Jim, I do so love our give-and-take relationship.<eos> But it's starting to feel a bit one-sided.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll owe you a favor.<eos> You already do.
- That's it. I don't do diamond tennis bracelets.<eos> Look, this thing rolled downhill hard and fast.<eos> Which is pretty interesting, I think.<eos> No, what it means is that Neville Montgomery has got some very powerful friends.<eos> Have you got something on him?<eos> The beginning of a theory.<eos> Come on, Angie... You need more than that.<eos> You just got back. So why cross the man who's got the deputy chief's ear?<eos> Because the Montgomerys are hiding something, and you know how I feel about secrets.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> - No, it's too late.<eos> - Been doing it for months.<eos> You guys are gonna bankrupt me.<eos> - Paleo burger, please.<eos> - Two, please.<eos> And a diet root beer.<eos> What planet am I on?<eos> I got to get down to the range.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Look, the bar codes - Sod the bar codes!<eos> That lad confessed to the murder of Dawn Ashworth,<eos> - and we know he killed Lynda.<eos> - OK, Dr. Jeffreys -<eos> Dr. Jeffreys is talking through his arse!<eos> Sorry!<eos> Right.<eos> Alec, I want you to run the same tests on the samples we've got from Dawn Ashworth.<eos> - I thought you had a confession.<eos> - We do!
What if there's a mistake?<eos> Let me be absolutely clear about this.<eos> There is no mistake.<eos> All of us have one of these.<eos> And all of them are different, unique.<eos> This is me.<eos> This is my unique code.<eos> And this... ..is the code of the killer.<eos> You don't need to be here, you know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Come on.<eos> I need to know what happened five years ago.<eos> I'll tell you what happened.<eos> Theo was having an affair with Patty.<eos> I told Stetson so that he would get her to break it off with Theo, and instead, he killed them both.<eos> His own wife, my husband.<eos> He destroyed my family.<eos> Why didn't you tell the detectives five years ago?<eos> Do they know what we're talking about?<eos> We do.
I'm worried about her.<eos> I went to the police station.<eos> They said she wasn't there.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Cherry always finds her way home.<eos> I'm asking around, seeing if I can get you a deal, but guns aren't cheap.<eos> Well, I might be falling into some money soon.<eos> How soon?<eos> You know I'm more the bartering type, anyway.<eos> I do.
It's good, right?<eos> You are a badass.<eos> Remind me not to steal from you.<eos> I don't think you were the target.<eos> I'm gonna ask you to give me something you're not gonna want to give me.<eos> - What?<eos> - The Panther member roll.<eos> I want to see everybody who was supposed to be at that meeting last night, and the attendance sheet, so I can see who was not.<eos> You think it was a Panther?<eos> - Your brother did.
What is my problem?<eos> You want to know what my problem is?<eos> It could not have been a more rhetorical question.<eos> All these yahoos in my business have turned on me.<eos> You know?<eos> Suddenly, I have a "reputation"<eos> for boning other guys' wives and girlfriends.<eos> I can't even get a job.<eos> - I thought you had a job.<eos> - I did.
When kids would make fun of me about being adopted, she used to come out in her muumuu and chuck stale bagels at 'em.<eos> Made me feel so safe.<eos> Kids are such dicks.<eos> Right?<eos> And so sticky.<eos> You know, it makes me happy to think that someone was there, taking care of you.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You do.
I-I wanted you to come.<eos> All this college talk with your mom, I thought maybe you'd enjoy coloring outside the lines for once.<eos> For once?<eos> I was arrested, Jonny.<eos> For murder.<eos> And they dropped the charges, but I cannot mess up again, okay?<eos> I can't be arrested again.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, now you do.

'Cause all those deaths are on me, too.<eos> The gas is called midnight oil.<eos> You designed a poison gas, Howard?<eos> No!<eos> Well, not intentionally.<eos> The army wanted something that would keep soldiers awake for days at a time, but it failed.<eos> Caused symptoms similar to sleep deprivation...<eos> Anger, hallucinations, psychosis.<eos> If you knew all that, why use it in Finow?<eos> I didn't.
Set a meeting... and I'll speak with him myself.<eos> Understood.<eos> This is pointless, Matt.<eos> We should be out on the streets, cracking names and taking skulls.<eos> - I think you have that backwards.<eos> - Not the way I do it.<eos> Five minutes out there and you'd end up in intensive care.<eos> Hey, I handled myself pretty damn skippy against baldy and his tattooed gorilla.<eos> - Tell him, K.<eos> - No, you did.
My boy said you had plenty to say to him.<eos> I put myself out there.<eos> You think it's my fault they don't see it, what I could bring?<eos> You wanna call me a loser to my face, you little shit?<eos> I didn't call you a loser, man.<eos> Oh, my boy's a liar now, huh?<eos> He say it, or not?<eos> - Speak up when I'm talking to you.<eos> - He said it.<eos> No, I didn't.
No, I might have you edged out on that.<eos> Okay, present company excluded.<eos> All I'm saying is Armand Tully is a dead end.<eos> You find something out?<eos> I, um, did a little back-channeling with Marci.<eos> Okay, ew, just... What did you get?<eos> Tully really is on an island that he bought with the money that Confed Global is paying him for all his real estate holdings in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Then, that's the link!<eos> I mean, it ties Fisk directly to what's happening in the tenement case.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Conflict?<eos> Man cannot be both savior and oppressor... light and shadow.<eos> One has to be sacrificed for the other.<eos> Choose... and choose wisely.<eos> Or others shall choose for you.<eos> Hello, gorgeous.<eos> Hello, handsome.<eos> You're wearing that aftershave.<eos> - You remember?<eos> - Of course, I do.
Are you trying to tell me that you didn't take Spanish<eos> - to snuggle up to what's-her-name...<eos> - What? The Greek girl?<eos> Well, I... surely I would take Greek?<eos> No, because she was taking Spanish.<eos> She already spoke Greek.<eos> Whatever happened to her?<eos> She was smokin'.<eos> Man, it didn't work out.<eos> When does it ever with you, buddy?
This city needs me in that mask, Foggy.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe it does.<eos> But I don't.<eos> I only ever needed my friend.<eos> I wouldn't have kept this from you, Matt.<eos> Not from you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
A very rough patch.<eos> You wanna talk?<eos> Yeah... but I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> It's...<eos> If you say "it's complicated," I will punch you in the face.<eos> It's personal!<eos> It's personal, okay?<eos> Okay... okay, it's personal, I get it.<eos> Really don't.
It's...<eos> If you say "it's complicated," I will punch you in the face.<eos> It's personal!<eos> It's personal, okay?<eos> Okay... okay, it's personal, I get it.<eos> Really don't.<eos> Trust me.<eos> They started tearing down Elena's tenement building today.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
- You're bullshit!<eos> Jed, Jed!<eos> Back off, or I'll put a bullet in your eye!<eos> Put the gun away, Jed.<eos> Put the gun away.<eos> We're all done, so just take the suitcase to the car, okay?<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> So you think you know me now?<eos> You think you know Hillary?<eos> 'Cause you don't.
Yes, I, uh... I looked after him.<eos> I made sure he's safe, but, uh...<eos> This needs to stop.<eos> Yesterday at the Surgical Center during all that...<eos> Confusion...<eos> Darius said that people were getting shot.<eos> I can't be a part of that.<eos> I won't be a part of that.<eos> You have a 10-year-old, Doc.<eos> Yes, yes, I do.
Come on, it's the least I can do.<eos> Fine, but as deputy chief of this department,<eos> I want answers on my desk tomorrow.<eos> Antoine?<eos> I looked after him. I made sure he's safe, but, uh...<eos> This needs to stop.<eos> My son's your responsibility until I say he isn't.<eos> Nurse Polk?<eos> You have a second?<eos> Actually, I don't, Dr. Ellison.
No regular people die.<eos> Retro Girl is not a person.<eos> She's the over-exposed image that's being sold to you.<eos> - Do what you have to do - You're coming with us.<eos> We are the police.<eos> OK?<eos> Enough of this.<eos> They can't take you away from your home.<eos> - You know how to get out of here? - Yeah.<eos> I do.
He's been coming in here for months.<eos> I fear so.<eos> And you did not know?<eos> I did not.<eos> - I want to show you something.<eos> - Well, hey,<eos> I know I'm the new guy here, but shouldn't we be calling some Powers for help?<eos> - Yeah. - The first name that comes to my mind is Retro Girl.<eos> She's right, we need help.<eos> No, we don't.
Yeah, man.<eos> Maybe you should move down to Louisiana, help me start my fishing business!<eos> You and I together, man, we could catch a lot of shrimp!<eos> I mean, there's rock shrimp, Atlantic shrimp, salt shrimp, boo-boo shrimp, tater shrimp, shrimp on a stick, shrimp remoulade, shrimp in your pasta, you know what, fuck shrimp!<eos> Okay, so, no on the shrimp biz?<eos> What's the situation with your hair?<eos> Did I call your number?<eos> Are we in a deli?<eos> We are not.<eos> And I did not.
Man, you guys are so good.<eos> So, you really dug our sound?<eos> I do think you guys have potential.<eos> Well, cool, 'cause we're just barely scratching' by.<eos> Not making' a dime.<eos> Well, I think that's all gonna change.<eos> But I have one criticism, and do not take this the wrong way.<eos> I'm just saying, maybe tinker with the name of the band, you know?<eos> You don't like "The Wildcats"?<eos> No, yeah, no, I don't.
Tickle her back.<eos> Pull that scrunchie out.<eos> Yeah, get the hair down.<eos> Pick up the pace, pick up the pace.<eos> Sorry, buddy.<eos> Had to light my cigar.<eos> Show was just starting.<eos> Keep goin'.<eos> Nah, you didn't see nothing.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Not now, darling.<eos> Hey, Clem, you don't have to do this for me, buddy.<eos> Joe Dirt, we may meet again someday. I don't know.<eos> But for that to happen, you must meet your destiny.<eos> You've learned how hot it is when you lose your shade tree.<eos> Go get your shade tree back.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Hey, by the way, why doesn't it sound fruity when you say that?<eos> You don't have time for the explanation.<eos> - I don't.
- Hey!<eos> - Hey, baby.<eos> - I think it's good.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - I know, I gotta get 'em.<eos> - Get his stick!<eos> Come on, you little hicks.<eos> So that is the whole story, it's crazy.<eos> Joe, we love you just the way you are.<eos> We do, Daddy!
You three are evicted.<eos> Del, you can evict us all you want, but, um... I think we're gonna finish this match.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Not on my property, you're not.<eos> Oh, damn, Waymond, it just got real out here.<eos> Have you ever seen anything like this?<eos> Anders, do you think we should shut this down?<eos> No, I don't, Montez.
I... yes...<eos> No!<eos> You mustn't speak!<eos> I thought I had made that clear.<eos> If you speak, I will have to cut out your brother's throat.<eos> Now then...<eos> Where did your son and queen go?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> None of them do.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> You know, I think it might be easier for the DNC to just move in.<eos> Hello, chef.<eos> Tell us what you're making today.<eos> It's personal lubricant.<eos> - Mom, Frankie verbally molested me.<eos> - Join the club, honey.<eos> And you're using this, like, for... adult lubricating purposes?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah, we both do.
- Oh, right.<eos> You already do.<eos> - I don't mean alone, alone.<eos> I meant alone without a man, not alone with you.<eos> I... I like you.<eos> - I struggle to believe you.<eos> - I do, too.<eos> Where were you, in a bunker in the sixties?<eos> That's where the rest of us discovered you don't need a man to define yourself.<eos> No, you don't.
George, I don't think it's so much what Underwood did, but what he didn't do.<eos> He remained presidential.<eos> And when the attacks came his way, he held the high ground.<eos> Now, Dunbar and Sharp, they came out swinging, and I think it hurt them both.<eos> Yeah, but Sharp had to do something.<eos> She's 20 points behind the other two.<eos> But the sexism thing?<eos> And going after Dunbar's kids?<eos> - It seemed quite desperate.<eos> - She did do some damage to Dunbar.
That's the best part.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I'll save you the trouble of trying to convince me.<eos> Claire Underwood.<eos> We need to hit her hard.<eos> You want dirt.<eos> I don't have any.<eos> You must.<eos> If I did, I don't know if I'd shovel it your way.<eos> But I don't.
We're different people.<eos> You should go.<eos> Put this behind you.<eos> I guess it was naive to think that we could remain close.<eos> So this is it?<eos> Yeah. It is.<eos> Jackie?<eos> Jackie...<eos> She says she has it.<eos> She doesn't.
I won't.<eos> I watched the world die, Ramse... everyone.<eos> I watched her die.<eos> It's meant to happen, brother.<eos> She's always gonna die.<eos> Hey, don't...<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> You think you're saving people?<eos> You do, don't you?
Have you been here before?<eos> Never.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I feel like... Like I'm in a dream, and if I could just wake up, my dad would be alive.<eos> I can't believe he's really gone.<eos> Look... When terrible things happen, you have to remember<eos> to look forward.<eos> He didn't deserve to die.<eos> Hey. I know what will cheer you up.<eos> I do.
Fine.<eos> Did you see the girl in room four today?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Um, it's just, um, her bed hasn't been slept in.<eos> I went down there to make sure that her window shade was working, and clearly she hasn't slept in her bed.<eos> Her car's still there, so I... Just seems odd.<eos> Did you see her at all last night?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'll see you for our date tonight, okay?<eos> I'll be here.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You need something?<eos> I live, um, over the hill...<eos> South face.<eos> You know, we're neighbors.<eos> Oh. I-I didn't know that we had any neighbors over the hill on the South face.<eos> Well, you do.
Maybe.<eos> But still it was wrong. _ An apology letter?<eos> Why?<eos> Hey, you two. _<eos> So...<eos> I, uh, just talked to Rafael.<eos> And I made a decision.<eos> I'm taking the teaching job.<eos> Look, if I had a talent for writing telenovelas, that'd be one thing.<eos> But I don't, so...
"and when I came back, the corkscrew was gone.<eos> "I thought it was very strange.<eos> "but now I know a bellboy was murdered. "I have a bad feeling, rose,<eos> "about my father. You need to get away, rose, right now."<eos> Emilio: Rose... Rose:<eos> You have been acting so strange since I got back.<eos> I am not acting strange.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> It makes me think you don't want to come away with me.<eos> I do.
Yes, you are right!<eos> I don't know how I missed it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are a true friend.<eos> So, can I ask you a question?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you think they'll last?<eos> Jane and Rafael?<eos> 'Cause I don't think they will.<eos> Deep down, I-I don't.
Bora bora?<eos> When are you going To get your life together?<eos> Look at your sister.<eos> Even she is on the right path.<eos> Luisa: No, thank you.<eos> I'm newly sober and they say alcoholics Either end up in rehab, in jail or dead.<eos> I chose rehab.<eos> There is no need to give them every single detail, luisa.<eos> In any case, you need a job.<eos> No, I really don't.
About it, actually. Yeah.<eos> I have to get to work.<eos> Yeah, uh, we have a meeting, so... Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Hello, jane.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> I thought you left.<eos> Oh, I did.
That life is too short, I don't know what does. So you two are gonna tell each other How you feel honestly right now.<eos> Go.<eos> Okay, mom, you go first.<eos> Rogelio is...<eos> Dad?<eos> Right.<eos> Dad is considering going to mexico.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> You know.<eos> No, we don't.
! Then why'd you has?<eos> Because you've voted in two elections.<eos> It was time you understood the process. Ha, ha. Mom...<eos> What does love feel like?<eos> Why?<eos> Just curious.<eos> How do you know for sure you're in love?<eos> It sort of feels like...<eos> Your heart is glowing, if that makes sense.<eos> It doesn't.
- almost done.<eos> - No.<eos> No, it is not done.<eos> - But it's changing.<eos> - It's changing, definitely.<eos> And maybe for the better.<eos> Maybe it's time your life changes, too.<eos> I mean, you don't want to live here forever, right?<eos> In grandma's house?<eos> - No, I don't.
Most gyms have free Wi-Fi.<eos> Restaurants, too.<eos> I bet you he was eating out every night.<eos> You know, club owners score mad dates.<eos> How often is he at Carla's Cafe?<eos> Almost every day.<eos> Well, according to the network logs in Evan's laptop, he connected to the coffee shop's Wi-Fi the morning after the murder.<eos> You still think it's a possibility that he framed himself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I don't know.<eos> I don't know. You know, maybe... I just want to kill you myself.<eos> You gonna?<eos> Maybe... because I am West 7.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You never were.<eos> Get me out of here.<eos> There's still time.<eos> No, see, I don't owe you a damn thing.<eos> No, you don't.
This time it changed.<eos> Something's different with the plague, I don't know what.<eos> - Chechnya, Operation Troy.<eos> - What? - Cassie plays a role somehow.<eos> - Operation Troy?<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> That's classified.<eos> Where I come from, it's history.<eos> Look, you're never gonna believe me. I get that.<eos> Cassie does.
So where is she?<eos> You did a good job back there.<eos> I let you kill a man.<eos> You didn't let me do anything.<eos> - I didn't stop you.<eos> - You still don't believe me, do you?<eos> I believe that this cult is real, but, no, I don't think you're Marty McFly.<eos> Who?<eos> - Do you think she's already...<eos> - No, I don't.
I guess.<eos> It's a little Amanda Woodward.<eos> I love her.<eos> I know.<eos> Me too.<eos> Seems pretty conservative, though.<eos> Okay, consider my source.<eos> I'm getting fashion advice from Mrs. Purple Doc Martens.<eos> I don't have Purple Doc Martens.<eos> Yes, you do.
No charge.<eos> Besides, you know, Lolly will probably stop by later anyways.<eos> She usually does.<eos> You're also a little curious about the list, too, right?<eos> Vaguely.<eos> Well, that was fun, but I feel like I know way too much about all of you.<eos> But, like, not so much about Becca, though.<eos> What?<eos> I drink.<eos> I did, a few...
Seriously, even nervous Lois has had a one-night stand.<eos> Well, if that's what's bothering you, have a one-night stand tonight.<eos> That's not what this is about.<eos> Maybe it is.<eos> Maybe a one-night stand represents all the things you think you missed out on.<eos> I mean, we both know the old Becca never would have considered having one.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> I mean, what's the point of having a do-over if I'm just gonna be the same old Becca?<eos> Well, let's find you a target.<eos> Whoo! Okay, what do I do?
It's nothing important.<eos> Okay.<eos> So you're really gonna do this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why not?<eos> This is my second chance at life.<eos> I am the new Becca, and I am gonna live this life, and I am gonna have sex with a stranger tonight!<eos> Not him.<eos> Plenty of options here.<eos> Okay, what do I do?
No, I won't...<eos> I won't tell you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> I look at your body, you know what I see?<eos> Potential.<eos> I mean, you got a long ways to go, but the foundation, it is there.<eos> You want to feel something?<eos> Do you?<eos> You do.
Hey, can I ask you something? Mm hmm. How did you know that the blood in the house belonged to me?<eos> You would have had to have tested it specifically.<eos> Cisco tested it against everyone who worked at S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> You wanted to know if it belonged to Wells?<eos> Joe.<eos> Dr. Wells had nothing to do with my mom's murder.<eos> You believe that now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah...<eos> I do.
I... Wait. How did you find out?<eos> When I touched The Flash the other night, I felt a jolt of electricity.<eos> The only other time I have ever felt anything like that was when you were in a coma after the accident.<eos> I can't believe I didn't figure it out sooner.<eos> I can only imagine how angry you are.<eos> I'm not angry, Barry.<eos> I'm just disappointed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Does Eddie know?<eos> Yes, he does.
Well, John, I think we've both made some bad decisions.<eos> - You threatened my family.<eos> - I gave Janey a present.<eos> I would've thought you of all people would appreciate the sentiment.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> Let's get practical here, okay?<eos> The stuff you took?<eos> You said you dumped it?<eos> - I did.
Son of a bitch showed up at my shop this morning.<eos> Just walks right in, tells me the product is gone.<eos> - Gone?<eos> - He said his brother took it.<eos> But he thinks he can get it back.<eos> I'd say it's time to cut your losses.<eos> That's a big fucking bundle to give up on.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Eric told me you left.<eos> I did.
I have seen the tape. What the hell were you doing?<eos> I was upset.<eos> I didn't believe what was happening and I asked to see my husband.<eos> Police brutality?<eos> Extracting a confession through violence?<eos> It had been a very intense day.<eos> It was an error of judgement but I had her removed as fast as I could.<eos> How am I supposed to deal with this in court?<eos> Do you realise how the defence will use this?<eos> ~ Yeah, I do.
No, it's not a risk, it's an opportunity.<eos> ~ It's only gonna come once.<eos> ~ Do it officially.<eos> ~ Talk to Jenkinson or one of your old bosses.<eos> ~ Nobody cares, Miller.<eos> The case is tainted.<eos> Nobody wants to get near it.<eos> That's my failing.<eos> I've got to put it right.<eos> What if he didn't do it?
~ I didn't go near him!<eos> I wouldn't. Have you seen him?<eos> ~ I quite like the look of him.<eos> I like a troubled man.<eos> Not as troubled as you do, but -<eos> None of it is true.<eos> Make sure everybody understands that.<eos> ~ Oh, who cares!<eos> Everyone knows what a trial's like.<eos> ~ No, they don't.
Still uses her mum's surname.<eos> ~ She babysat for you quite regularly?<eos> ~ Every other week.<eos> Sometimes she'd stay over, other times I'd take her home.<eos> ~ Did she have a boyfriend?<eos> ~ No-one regular.<eos> Did you fancy her, Ricky?<eos> She was my niece.<eos> I had to ask.<eos> No, you didn't.
I just wanna go home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I've gotta go.<eos> ~ I bought gin.<eos> ~ Go away.<eos> I can take a loss, but this one mattered.<eos> Now the whole town knows I failed.<eos> It hurts.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, life does.
This was taken a week before, as you were installing your own floor.<eos> Those boards are not the same boards that are on that floor now.<eos> 'Those are dark-oak floorboards.<eos> What's down there now is light oak.'<eos> Same light-oak boards you bought Saturday morning, and again Monday.<eos> What did you use those boards for, Lee, between Saturday and Monday?<eos> What happened on the floor, Lee?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No.<eos> Something did.
You're doing what you feel is right.<eos> Just not sure if I could do it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Guillermo downstairs let me up.<eos> I think he's in love with me.<eos> Libby, you look great.<eos> Oh, thanks, sis.<eos> I'd look better with a drink in my hand.<eos> Well, you know where the bar is.<eos> - I do.
The patient.<eos> It's a long story, please, just go.<eos> Is he gonna be okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's scared, you know, but he's got a fighting chance, but it's a pretty risky operation.<eos> But at least it's a chance.<eos> And, in success, he'll be able to undo whatever it is they did to him.<eos> I'd envy that.<eos> I don't know... I guess I got to learn how to live with it, huh?<eos> We both do.
And tell that devil woman she's not allowed in your house!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - And then give your employee the rest of the day off for giving you such good advice!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Well, this turned out great.<eos> A romantic dinner with my sister and her husband.<eos> I'm sorry Erica stood you up.<eos> - Can't say I didn't see this...<eos> - Then don't.
Ironically, the reason we found them was because we were digging a foundation for a new wing of our resort.<eos> And you're still gonna build there?<eos> We only have so much land.<eos> To not use every inch of it would be wasteful.<eos> When you're Chief, your responsibility's to the people, not the land.<eos> You talk a lot.<eos> Hazard of the profession.<eos> If you dig up the mountain where the Lenape are, you wouldn't find any of this.<eos> They have no real Indian ancestry.<eos> Yes, they do.
I can't leave the state.<eos> - What? - I'm sorry.<eos> I can't go back to prison.<eos> Your husband's the hero, not me.<eos> Oh, you care about people.<eos> I know you, Phillip.<eos> - I know you.<eos> - No, you don't. I know you.<eos> I know you. I know you care about people.<eos> No, you don't!
Why?<eos> Why not?<eos> Since when is being nice a bad thing?<eos> Since we're in middle school.<eos> It's basically the worst thing you can say about a dude.<eos> Not to me.<eos> Everyone is always trying to be funny or cool or someone they're not.<eos> The last thing I want is to be with some clown.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> Or at least, I did.
Hi, Juilliard admissions board.<eos> I'm Erica Goldberg from Jenkintown, Pennsylvania.<eos> And I'm going to play... cut.<eos> Cut.<eos> That's a cut.<eos> No, not "cut."<eos> I'm in the middle of my Juilliard audition.<eos> Hon, I love the spirit and the passion and everything you're doing here, but it's, like, "gag me with a spoon."<eos> Sorry, do you kids still say that?<eos> We never really did.
Please tell me there's audience participation.<eos> So this is where you got married and perhaps contracted one or more of the "hepatie-tie."<eos> It is, but it didn't look like this.<eos> I mean, it didn't look much better than this.<eos> Well, the good news is, I am no longer sad that I missed your wedding.<eos> Excuse me, sir...<eos> Ma'am.<eos> What's going on?<eos> 'Cause we got married here.<eos> - No, you didn't.

Okay, listen, I got this.<eos> He doesn't know that I'm pregnant.<eos> I will go shot for shot with him.<eos> Even if you weren't pregnant, your idea of "raging" is late-night "House Hunters" and chardonnay on ice.<eos> 'Ello, 'ello!<eos> Pints taste like a possum's piss over here.<eos> So, we are switching to whiskey.<eos> Ha-hoo! To Martin!<eos> Feel that one going down, don't you?<eos> Yeah... you do.
See, I've been doing this for a while now and I've developed a sixth sense for these kind of things.<eos> And you and me?<eos> We get to tussle I think.<eos> Listen, I don't know who you think I am or what I've done but you're wrong.<eos> Please, if you let me go now I don't say anything to anybody.<eos> I promise.<eos> I'll keep it between you and me.<eos> We can play these games all you want but I do not have all day and I think you know exactly what that means.<eos> You really don't want to do this.<eos> I really do.
Good to hear.<eos> What happened?<eos> - Have you slept at all?<eos> - The reporter.<eos> What did he say?<eos> - It's a conversation, not a decree.<eos> - So he said "no."<eos> It's a scary situation, so that's understandable, but you gotta give me that. Huh?<eos> He'll come around.<eos> - And what if he doesn't?
You know what this is all about?<eos> Paul Winthrop has been killing his mother over and over, getting ready for his End of Days.<eos> And with Jared gone, that time has come.<eos> Paul will find May.<eos> He will render judgment.<eos> Unless you protect her.<eos> As, apparently, I no longer can.<eos> Okay.<eos> If I'm gonna protect May, I need to know where she is.<eos> You already do.
Purses.<eos> Bags.<eos> Bags.<eos> Automated voice: The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time...<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Marty. Are you gonna start Facebook stalking me next?<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah, I think you know I'm here.<eos> Yeah, you want that big ol' payday.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why am I so turned on right now?<eos> Me, too.<eos> Bitch!<eos> Marty, let's go.<eos> Monica: Oh, my God, you broke my nose, you bitch!<eos> I'm actually scared of you right now.<eos> Good.<eos> Monica: Oh, God. Marty:<eos> Oh, we're gonna make these motherfuckers bleed. You said "we."<eos> I did?
I know that voice. What happened?<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake, Grace, there's a shitstorm over here, all because you kissed a convict.<eos> What?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Sol did, after Frankie told him.<eos> And now I'm paying for it.<eos> I gotta go, kid. He's beside himself!<eos> - You told Sol I kissed Byron!<eos> - I didn't know it was a secret.<eos> - Of course you did!
A defense attorney starts hammering him about some inconsistency,<eos> Grandpa is gonna start hammering back and down goes the gavel.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> He's the only witness we've got.<eos> There were ten other witnesses there.<eos> And half of them did not see DeCarlo with a gun.<eos> The other half are either dead or unreachable.<eos> Which is why I am thinking of a plea deal.<eos> You don't want to plead out a cop killer.<eos> No, I don't.
That's a year minimum in county, smart guy.<eos> I'm sorry, man, that was wrong.<eos> - Why'd you run?<eos> - 'Cause everyone else did.<eos> It's like a... a reaction.<eos> "Five-o!<eos> Five-o!" That's what you do.<eos> - You run.<eos> - We just wanted to talk to you.<eos> You did?
There's too much to do.<eos> Listen, honey, even if you find something, it won't hold up in court.<eos> It's contaminated evidence, chain of custody...<eos> Listen, Betty, Victim Services can help you.<eos> Don't. Don't treat me like I'm your case.<eos> Okay, well then, just tell me what you need.<eos> I need you to stop looking at me like that. Okay?<eos> Everyone. Please.<eos> There's a uniform posted at the door.<eos> No need to do that for me.
-Yes, who the hell are you?<eos> -Christer Korsback.<eos> Christer Korsback?<eos> Tonni mentioned you. And?<eos> -Fucking cunt! I'm going to cut you. -You're gonna cut me?<eos> I don't even live there anymore, so piss off, you fucking prick.<eos> Hey! Is there room for one more? I have money, wait...<eos> Somewhere. I have eight or nine here.<eos> How much did you say the rent was?<eos> -I didn't. 1500.
Nevertheless, it, uh, seems that I owe you an apology.<eos> Like I said, I can't blame you for not remembering.<eos> No, sir.<eos> The apology that I owe is for my craven attempt to pilfer that which rightfully belongs to you.<eos> As defense, I offer only my ignorance.<eos> Meaning you thought you were stealing from Calhoun?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I did.<eos> And now you know the prize in question belongs to me.<eos> - That, I do. - Mm-hmm.
- "Aplex"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 28 points. Boom!<eos> I'm pretty sure "aplex" isn't a word, Mikey.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> "I don't like that guy.<eos> He aplexes me. "<eos> Yeah?<eos> He's going. You want me to follow him or not?<eos> Yes, I do.
I have a problem that can only be solved with your wealth of expertise.<eos> Now... what say...<eos> we... we let the past fade off in the rearview and start anew?<eos> I - I... I just...<eos> Well, come on, Zachariah, I just want to talk to you!<eos> - Who in the hell was that again?<eos> - That's Ava's uncle.<eos> He and the other Randolphs never did forgive my deceased brother Bowman for how he treated Ava.<eos> Doesn't seem like that bottle's gonna get it done.<eos> No, it does not.
I wasn't. - Did you even plan?<eos> Where were you gonna stay tonight and the night after?<eos> You got cash?<eos> How much?<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> You know it's gotta be cash and only cash, right?<eos> And what about an I.D.?<eos> You got a new I.D.? Hmm?<eos> That's the only way to get off the grid.<eos> No, I don't.
Emma, maybe you should take your friend to see one of those grief counselors.<eos> Hey, Audrey.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know.<eos> Audrey.<eos> Look, we're gonna figure this out, I promise.<eos> The crazy thing is, I kind of want it to be Tyler.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I just want it to be over.<eos> Everyone does.
You know what, maybe it's actually better if I don't.<eos> Don't think that.<eos> He said that it ends with me.<eos> So let's just skip ahead to the ending.<eos> You can't let this sadistic bastard win.<eos> If you're the key to all of this, then you have to find a way to fight back.<eos> I did.<eos> And he sliced Will in half, right in front of me.<eos> I don't know if I have any fight left.<eos> Yes, you do.
I came as soon as I heard what was happening.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You're sorry?<eos> Have you talked to Mom?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I wasn't sure she'd let me see you.<eos> In your last letter, you said you were doing good.<eos> My last letter out of the dozens that you've ignored?<eos> I wanted to answer them, Emma.<eos> I did.
He is literally a different person.<eos> But that doesn't make everything about him a lie.<eos> I wouldn't be so sure.<eos> Why didn't you ever tell me?<eos> Because I knew you would get all judgy.<eos> Brooke, I am not judging you.<eos> After everything that we've been through, I just want to make sure that you're actually seeing this clearly.<eos> Are you?<eos> 'Cause after what happened to Will, it seems like you just need to hold someone accountable.<eos> I do.
If you can't hear me and trust me...<eos> Then Branson won.<eos> Even sitting in his jail cell, he beat you.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Where's Kieran?<eos> He left.<eos> I messed things up royally.<eos> Or maybe he left because he did it.<eos> Audrey, I know that you want justice for Rachel...<eos> Yeah, I do.
I don't know!<eos> Just listen to me, okay?<eos> Brooke, this whole thing...<eos> This whole thing is a mistake, okay?<eos> The night that you came to the theater, I was so, so damn happy to see you.<eos> I miss you.<eos> I miss what we've had.<eos> But whatever they say about me, you have to know that I would never hurt you.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.
I think so.<eos> I'm gonna ride with my mom.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> You got your classic showdown at the lake, tying together the past and present.<eos> And Survivor Girl in the back of an ambulance, just like somebody predicted.<eos> Exactly!<eos> Except today, we're all sitting in the back of the ambulance together.<eos> Well, not literally, 'cause then we wouldn't all fit, but you know what I mean.<eos> I do.
Here.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come and sit down.<eos> Go on.<eos> I got an old Texas fix for twisted ankles.<eos> Please.<eos> May I?<eos> - Is this gonna hurt?<eos> - Eh, more than it does right now.
It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Adele, Adele, it's all right.<eos> Adele, just do as I say.<eos> Understand?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Spencer... You have to lay flat.<eos> It'll slow the bleeding.<eos> I need a doctor.<eos> Well, of course you do.
Skipjack works for Flowers.<eos> He was found murdered this morning.<eos> A woman who whored for him shot him through the heart.<eos> Is she alive?<eos> Her throat was cut.<eos> What was her name?<eos> The papers didn't say.<eos> Hmm. It's Adele.<eos> Lizzie said that she thought that this Adele might have run off with Spencer.<eos> Of course she did.
My son.<eos> The only person in this world who truly needed me.<eos> - No...<eos> - You made him sick.<eos> - You made him weak.<eos> - No!<eos> You gave him something over time...<eos> Stop it!<eos> You really think that I'm capable of murdering your child?<eos> I didn't before.
I mean, I probably am a little thicker around the middle, but there's also...<eos> We don't need to see your bra.<eos> What we want to know is what you're doing back in the picture, and if you really know what you're getting into.<eos> Do you really know what you're getting into?<eos> No, I... I... I don't.<eos> - Good answer.<eos> - That is a good answer.<eos> Well, what about my stuff?<eos> Well, take it easy on her.<eos> You never do.
When was it?<eos> Did he leave you?<eos> Why do you want to know?<eos> No reason.<eos> Just to know.<eos> Was it him or you?<eos> - No one left anyone.<eos> - So why aren't you with him?<eos> - He didn't love you.<eos> - He did.
~ Sir.<eos> This business with, er...<eos> Sood.<eos> You see, Willingdon was quite determined, and...<eos> No, you deserve better than that.<eos> Sood was becoming a lightning rod for all sorts of other discontents, which, although he played no part in them personally...<eos> You wish to close the book.<eos> To end it, yes.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> ~ You do?
Darius Dalal, sir.<eos> You've been in the wars.<eos> ~ Yes, sir.<eos> ~ He fought at Gallipoli.<eos> In which case, allow me to introduce Captain Turner.<eos> You'll have to speak up, he's a little deaf.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Yes, you do.
- No.<eos> - We know she's been here.<eos> Then she was murdered.<eos> I had nothing to do with the parties.<eos> Which parties?<eos> There came a man who asked to hire an empty room for a single night.<eos> He paid cash so that the agreement could not be traced.<eos> He offered me 50,000 crowns, and I just needed to let him, -and then come and unlock the next morning.<eos> - It seemed innocent.<eos> - It always does it.
- We have to call everyone.<eos> -And get my ring back.<eos> - And see the pawnbroker.<eos> - And the wedding...<eos> Hey, hey! hey"'<eos> What pawnbroker, what ring, what wedding?<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Eva.<eos> If you're making another scene, I want to know what's going on.<eos> - You do? -Of course.
Eva!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Let me out!<eos> Damn it, let me out!<eos> I just want to see Eva!<eos> I need to get out!<eos> I just want to be with Eva.<eos> Eva.<eos> You really want to be with me?<eos> I do.
If he gets a hold of me again...<eos> Trish...<eos> If you leave that girl with him, and...<eos> What would you have me do?<eos> What exactly should I do?<eos> We'll figure out a way to protect you.<eos> We?<eos> He's coming for me, not you.<eos> I know!<eos> You don't.
Do you see me trying to kill every shitty driver?<eos> No!<eos> Because I don't work my shit out on other people!<eos> So keep your goddamn feelings to yourselves!<eos> Ninety-nine.<eos> You wanted to know how many of us there are?<eos> The last time I counted, I had 99 gifted friends in this borough alone.<eos> And now every single one of them is gonna know about this shit that you tried to pull.<eos> And they hate attempted murder.<eos> They really do.
I know I don't.<eos> You're right, I'm out of line.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I have to be on air in an hour. You know what?<eos> Screw it, I'll cancel.<eos> No, things have to appear normal to Kilgrave.<eos> I can help.<eos> - Thanks, but I don't need you.<eos> - Uh, yeah, you do.
You're right, I'm out of line.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I have to be on air in an hour. You know what?<eos> Screw it, I'll cancel.<eos> No, things have to appear normal to Kilgrave.<eos> I can help.<eos> - Thanks, but I don't need you.<eos> - Uh, yeah, you do.<eos> No, she doesn't.
- I had to deal with something. - More important than a paying customer?<eos> Life and death, actually.<eos> Figured you were blowing me off.<eos> I wouldn't just bail on you.<eos> You've done it before.<eos> I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for.<eos> Anything that points to where Antoine might've gone.<eos> Airline receipts, train schedules.<eos> Won't find any of that if someone grabbed him.<eos> No one did.
How would I do that?<eos> You would have to stay with him, giving up your life as Trish Walker, living with him.<eos> - You mean have sex with him.<eos> - No, not that, but you'd have to be with him and point him in the right direction.<eos> Would I have any guarantee that he wouldn't use his abilities on me?<eos> None.<eos> But you could potentially change the world.<eos> What would you do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
It won't do him any good.<eos> - Stop what?<eos> - Guilt makes people do stupid shit.<eos> I'm not guilty.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> See, I hate that.<eos> I want everything to be my fault.<eos> Good or bad.<eos> Means I have some control.<eos> - You don't.
You help people.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> And you make the rest of us look like selfish pricks.<eos> Is that a compliment or--<eos> There are other nurses at the hospital who can help.<eos> There's only one that can help Luke.<eos> I just don't want him to wake up alone, not knowing what's happening.<eos> I don't even know what's happening.<eos> It's asking a lot, and you don't know me, but...<eos> Sure I do.
It's time to catch up with me on body count.<eos> Time to get some real payback.<eos> Gaby...<eos> Speak of the devil.<eos> Now if anyone here deserves vengeance, Gaby, it's you.<eos> Senior year, this son of a bitch tells you he loves you.<eos> He steals your virginity, knocks you up, and then heads for the hills.<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> I wanted to kill him.<eos> I still do.
Excuse me.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you, gentlemen.<eos> You'll like the Israeli press attache.<eos> He's like the sphinx, only Jewish.<eos> Thanks, Judy.<eos> We don't have time for PR, Milton.<eos> This isn't PR.<eos> We have a contract with the Israeli government.<eos> They're concerned the judges won't ever give us permission to film.<eos> And what if they don't?
You don't understand, Maggie.<eos> You're out of your depth.<eos> Our kiss... threw me for a loop.<eos> But I see now that it may have caused you pain, and I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry for harassing you about Herschel and...<eos> I'm orthodox.<eos> I live with a whole host of expectations.<eos> This isn't about just our kiss.<eos> - No, I understand that.<eos> - No, you don't.
We took her off the medication.<eos> Yeah, but you weren't his primary physician, and no other doctors were shot at.<eos> I don't know.<eos> (monitor beeping rapidly) Look, I'm sorry. I just don't think Rita's capable of this.<eos> He needs to rest.<eos> (monitor continues beeping rapidly) Can you come back another time?<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why did you lie about the divorce?<eos> I didn't.
Marisol talks about you all the time.<eos> You've been together a while.<eos> Since freshman year.<eos> Kyle and I met in high school.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You were a cheerleader, and he was the star quarterback. Ha!<eos> Ha ha! I used to get high behind metal shop every day, and Daisy honey trapped her teachers into giving her As. Ha ha ha!<eos> How do you guys know Marisol?<eos> Oh, we don't.
I need to show you something.<eos> This was his room.<eos> Oh, Vera, I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> It's a model of the solar system.<eos> He got an A-plus.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why would they just leave like this?<eos> I don't know, Alan.<eos> Wait.<eos> Yes, I do.
Look, I-I-I don't know why the door was open.<eos> It just was.<eos> I don't know George's day-to-day.<eos> I was just glad that the a/c was working.<eos> You said you hadn't talked to George in a long time.<eos> I did... say that.<eos> It had been a while.<eos> Too long, obviously.<eos> Look, we hunkered in, and we kicked back a couple of beers, waited for George to mosey on home.<eos> But he never did.
It's really happening.<eos> I'd say in weeks...<eos> Months maybe, but it's happening.<eos> I can go home?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can go anywhere.<eos> You can go to Tulsa or New York or anywhere.<eos> What's in Tulsa?<eos> You told mother?<eos> Amantha did.
Yeah, I've heard it.<eos> What were your foster parents like, Harry?<eos> Had several... wasn't close to any of them.<eos> The Saxons were beautiful people.<eos> When they took me in, I thought I was done with Maclaren.<eos> We had some good years.<eos> And then pop got sick and died, and they sent me back.<eos> You know all about that, Harry.<eos> You know all about the darkness, don't you?<eos> I do.
Why are you doing it?<eos> Because... why am I a policeman, Rachel?<eos> ~ Can you win?<eos> ~ Probably not.<eos> Unless I can get Andrew Cullen to crack, they'll wipe the floor with me.<eos> I haven't got the proof I need.<eos> This, to my mind, is evidence of malpractice but it doesn't actually prove anything.<eos> Geoffrey Inler says he burned the proof seven years ago.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> No, I don't.
All right.<eos> Thanks for everything.<eos> I really appreciate it. It's a big weight off my mind.<eos> Well, we like to help people, John.<eos> There's a cold wind blowing out there. Aye, I know. I'm all right now<eos> - I've got me long johns on.<eos> Tosser.<eos> Hey! What's going on? Ow!<eos> All right, lads. That's it.<eos> Well done.
Saracen. What do you know of this beast?<eos> We called it, jinn. Huh?<eos> It's mean, demon.<eos> Have you actually encountered one?<eos> Yes.<eos> In Jerusalem.<eos> So, how do we kill it?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Well, how did you kill it?<eos> We did not.
Cat...<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> You think Mom would be happy for me, Heather?<eos> Despite the fact that she all but tried to destroy Vincent?<eos> - Cat, don't do this...<eos> - No!<eos> I am... I am sick of hearing about how wonderful Mom is, how special Mom is, how much good Mom did.<eos> You don't know what she did, Heather.<eos> None of you do.
Why would Korbell order a hit after an unsuccessful raid?<eos> I mean, it just calls more attention to him.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The animal that escapes a snare doesn't necessarily go after the poacher.<eos> Okay, everyone, we can ask these questions in San Antonio.<eos> So, saddle up.<eos> What does this guy Peterson have on you?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because you're acting like he has something on you.<eos> He doesn't.
I'll figure it out, Tasha.<eos> Shawn, we can't be together, not like that, anyway.<eos> Sneaking around, trying not to get caught.<eos> This is the best we're gonna do.<eos> You need to listen to me, okay?<eos> - I have more to lose than you do. - No, you don't.<eos> Ghost ain't gonna kill you if he finds out about us.<eos> I don't need you to be my man, okay?<eos> I'm gonna have to be my own man from now on.<eos> No, you don't.
So do I.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have good reason to believe that Simon has been skimming from the clubs, hiding assets.<eos> And I don't have proof yet, but I know he's working with an outside company, Ravenna.<eos> Ravenna?<eos> That sick bastard.<eos> What is it?<eos> Our daughter's name.<eos> I didn't know you had kids.<eos> We don't.
I recognized you.<eos> I knew you knew James.<eos> When I said it, I saw your face.<eos> You bought in.<eos> And then you wouldn't let it go, so I figured I could save Tommy and save myself.<eos> Turns out I could only save one of us.<eos> I pick me.<eos> So you're completely done with Tommy?<eos> You don't care what happens to him?<eos> No, I don't.
My boss is gonna start getting pissed.<eos> Yeah, I got something else.<eos> How long did you serve in the military?<eos> Who says I did?<eos> Well, the hand signals used in the bank says you did.<eos> Nice try.<eos> You referred to lunch as "chow time."<eos> Military jargon.<eos> Coincidence?<eos> I did one tour.
That it's a ridiculous premise for an alternative college newspaper, much less the Old Gray Lady.<eos> You were right about this from the start.<eos> Correction.<eos> You and Sergeant Gormley were right about this from the start, and I missed it.<eos> It was a fastball right down the middle of the plate, and I never got the bat off my shoulder.<eos> Not down the middle; it just nicked the corner.<eos> Regardless, I missed it.<eos> And what's worse than that, I blasted Sergeant Gormley, the guy who hit it on the screws.<eos> I owe him an apology.<eos> Yes, you do.
"I think it looks good."<eos> "Do you really think so?"<eos> "Really?"<eos> "Yes, you look nice."<eos> "I wish that summer comes soon."<eos> "What?<eos> It just ended."<eos> "I know."<eos> "I hate hot weather."<eos> "You do?"
Can you see them?<eos> The princess and the prince.<eos> Let's see...<eos> Life isn't that easy!<eos> That's fine.<eos> It would be too perfect if we saw the stars now.<eos> By the way, Saori, it's your birthday, isn't it?<eos> Today.<eos> Did you forget about it?<eos> Well, everyone did.
Well, I suppose you don't really need one to distribute newspapers.<eos> We could cheer ourselves up by having a farewell party for it.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> What's this?<eos> Sorry, I borrowed it without asking you.<eos> What's that doing there?<eos> But...<eos> You told me you like sukiyaki.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Yes?<eos> Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> Do you feel it all?<eos> Feel what?<eos> You don't feel it.<eos> Your consciousness is too small to comprehend it.<eos> I feel the emptiness of messages bombarding me, telling me to consume.<eos> I feel like there's something lacking in my life, and I feel like you might have the answer.<eos> I do.

I don't have that kind of money.<eos> Let me look around.<eos> Maybe I can scrounge up half a million.<eos> Is that enough?<eos> No cards?<eos> Cards?<eos> I got Aota and Kawakami of the Giants, but not Mizuhara.<eos> Not baseball cards. I mean bank cards.<eos> Why would I need those?<eos> You don't?
Just say what you're trying to say.<eos> Repopulation, you dumb donkey.<eos> I'm not gonna have sex with you unless we're married.<eos> Fine. Will you marry me?<eos> - Yes, I will!<eos> - You will?<eos> - Yes! - Oh!<eos> Do you, Carol, take me, Phil,<eos> - to be your husband?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yeah, it was really pretty there.<eos> Just please don't tell me if you made out with any cute English girls because I cannot compete with those accents.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Oh, this is really last-minute, but there's this fundraiser tonight.<eos> It's kind of in my uncle's honor, and it's black tie. Do you want to be my date?<eos> It's gonna be all fancy, and you love fundraisers.<eos> Um, I...<eos> What?<eos> Brenna, I know before I left, we were thinking my parents would forget about what happened and they wouldn't care if we saw each other.<eos> But they still do.
I don't know how you do it... - working with sick kids all the time. - Oh.<eos> April is my youngest patient, and I have to say, it's hard to talk to her sometimes.<eos> She's dealing with fears that somebody her age shouldn't have to deal with.<eos> And then looking to me for reassurance that everything's going to be okay, when... when you don't know if she's going to be okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I tell her that she is.<eos> And I believe that she will be okay.<eos> But I can't control what happens.<eos> - I mean, you know...<eos> - I do.
I don't know!<eos> Why don't you ask<eos> Mr. Chica Cherry Cola over here.<eos> Okay, I am sorry that Savage Garden was the seminal band of my youth.<eos> Clearly you guys are under a lot of wedding stress.<eos> You're curating the ceremony, arranging the seating charts, not to mention figuring out what you're gonna wear.<eos> Hey, at least I got my tux already.<eos> - She still doesn't have a dress.<eos> - Oh my god!<eos> - You don't.
And... marry a guy I really just met.<eos> And the way I...<eos> I hold my breath every time they test my blood and... Scan my body.<eos> You just hope and you pray that... And if the results are bad...<eos> You try to accept it, and you get back up, because... because...<eos> Because that's the deal.<eos> There's no last hurrah, is there?<eos> No, every day is the last hurrah.<eos> You have to go. You know that.<eos> I do.
You try to accept it, and you get back up, because... because...<eos> Because that's the deal.<eos> There's no last hurrah, is there?<eos> No, every day is the last hurrah.<eos> You have to go. You know that.<eos> I do.<eos> But not before your wedding.<eos> And I need to make a decision about what may be the only book I ever write.<eos> I thought you'd decided.<eos> So did I.
But that's only because I wanted to keep my job.<eos> Personally...<eos> I think you get a free pass after everything you've been through.<eos> Thank you, but...<eos> I don't really like me right now.<eos> You know, who have I become?<eos> Blowing all this money and taking drugs?<eos> I mean, it's all so reprehensible.<eos> Kind of sounds like what our dad was doing the year before he died.<eos> Hm. It does.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> He loves you and misses you more than life itself.<eos> He thinks about you every moment of every dying day.<eos> He thinks about how you met at Colonel White High School.<eos> He's saying something about your hair.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he always liked it long.<eos> He still does.
What did they say?<eos> Not much.<eos> They said they'll review my request.<eos> I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't have asked that.<eos> I guess we're gonna find out.<eos> Looks like our vics were living pretty much off the grid:<eos> no bank accounts, no tax returns.<eos> Can't find a vehicle registration or driver's license for either one.<eos> Sounds like people who don't want to be found to me.<eos> Well, except the bounty hunter did.
- What do you think?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Stupid sop.<eos> You want to see the bedrooms?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna have a look.<eos> A quick shop, and then...<eos> No, no, then we'll get it done really fast.<eos> A quick shop, and then the store's closed.<eos> Yeah, because what time does the...
And what do you think about this whole government thing of, you know, listening in to people's private information?<eos> - I mean, that's crazy stuff.<eos> - Who knows?<eos> I mean, fuck them, you know?<eos> An eye for an eye, I say.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, this is a conversation for another time.<eos> But speaking of government, did you know that Simon was class president?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Nice to meet you guys. - Good to see you, Danny.<eos> - Hey, so this... Guys, this is my wife. Duffy.<eos> I've heard so much about you.<eos> Hi there, Duffy, my wife, Robyn.<eos> - Hello, Robyn. - Hello, you're so pretty. - Hi, there.<eos> - And this is, of course, Wendy Dale.<eos> She's spearheading Mergers and Acquisitions.<eos> Can I grab two of those? Here.<eos> Let's kick this party off with a toast here to welcome the new blood.<eos> - I don't actually...
Heather.<eos> Shh! They might hear you.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I don't know, but I think they might kill them, JT.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know; I've never been beaten up before.<eos> Wait, how did you know I was here?<eos> I didn't.
Julianna was going to kill you, and there was nothing I could do but watch it happen.<eos> But it didn't happen.<eos> I just kept thinking about you dying-- us dying-- without ever getting a chance to get married.<eos> Well, it's a good thing we didn't elope, then, right?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> My parents, they, uh... they didn't romanticize their wedding the way yours did.<eos> Oh, well, you know, everybody's different, you know?<eos> Doesn't mean they didn't love each other.<eos> No, I know.<eos> And they did.
Hey. Henry?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> This is your house?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why are you two here?<eos> We are here for a very legitimate, non-creepy reason that... Henry will now explain.<eos> We're working on the Aaron Brown murder.<eos> I believe he stopped here minutes before he was killed.<eos> Somebody did knock on my door that night, but why would Aaron want to come see me?<eos> He didn't.
Me too.<eos> Marco, I think you should know Jason had intended to return Kevin Crachiolla's investment using his own money.<eos> Because you raised him right, Marco.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Over time, however, one learns that the choices of those we love are impossible to control.<eos> You'll write... every day.<eos> Every day?<eos> Come on, mom.<eos> I love you so much, Abraham.<eos> Henry: We both do.
But follow their lead.<eos> You got greedy, Chappy.<eos> You got greedy, and you killed Rick for that gold.<eos> That's not true.<eos> He was gonna split it with us.<eos> You don't have to split anything if you steal it.<eos> You know, I could see a big guy like you handling a harpoon.<eos> Why would I kill him?<eos> Rick was the only one that knew where the gold was.<eos> Now nobody does.
Oh, is that what this is?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm not up on all of the latest rituals...<eos> But be aware, you're currently being courted.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> Here's to fate bringing us back together and justice served.<eos> I'm not quite sure that's the case.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I thought you had a confession.<eos> We do, but...
We recovered split bourbon at the scene.<eos> It was laced with a sedative.<eos> What sedative?<eos> Ketamine.<eos> It's an anesthetic, but it can also be used...<eos> Recreationally.<eos> I know what ketamine is.<eos> Did you catch that?<eos> He...<eos> Of course you did.
They've just had a recent outbreak of dysentery.<eos> No, um, Isaac wants to take me on vacation.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, he doesn't waste any time, does he?<eos> Yeah, I think he's getting impatient with me.<eos> Having trouble narrowing down a place?<eos> No, it's just, things are...<eos> Well, they're moving so fast.<eos> And... you're afraid you don't like him?<eos> No, I-I-I'm afraid that I do.
- That's not...<eos> - Sara, go home.<eos> No, no.<eos> He doesn't know what he's saying, no.<eos> I don't fucking want you!<eos> I already told you, you fucking priss.<eos> You're fucking nothing to me.<eos> I don't fucking want you.<eos> I don't want to come with you to fucking Bristol.<eos> I never did.
Ben?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm glad to see you're relaxing...<eos> Something you need to do more of.<eos> The baby is healthy, your panels are normal, but your blood pressure is a little bit higher than I'd like.<eos> You need to de-stress.<eos> Easier said than done.<eos> Prenatal yoga, more sleep, lean on your family.<eos> You have anyone in town?<eos> She does.
Come on.<eos> This is insane.<eos> I didn't rape Jess, I didn't put that in her sink, and I haven't seen that jacket since the day in the woods.<eos> I know, Mr. Crawford.<eos> What do you know?<eos> I know all about Jess Murphy.<eos> I know you didn't have the jacket.<eos> And I know you didn't kill Tom.<eos> You know?<eos> I do.
It's, uh, 9:27.<eos> Hi, Sandra, also.<eos> And Arthur, I guess.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, Stan.<eos> I need to see Sandra.<eos> Of course.<eos> I thought he was gonna pull the trigger.<eos> I really did.
(walkie-talkie chirps) CHRISTY: Yeah, hi.<eos> This is Christy Plunkett. Roscoe's mom.<eos> I'm gonna be keeping him home today.<eos> No, no, no, um, not sick.<eos> He lost his grandpa.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um, we're gonna need a couple of days here.<eos> Great, I'll pick up his homework.<eos> You know, if you want to watch TV, it's okay.<eos> I don't.
Although Molly's download was incomplete, the EPIC units are still useful.<eos> Our operatives are using them now, and they've been distributed to law enforcement.<eos> Great.<eos> The technology I've spent a year and billions of dollars developing is only a partial success.<eos> We can just arrest them all for trespassing.<eos> It'll be easy to isolate them with the EPIC.<eos> No, these are our customers, and every single one of them has a cell phone with a camera.<eos> We spoil their fun, it goes viral in an instant.<eos> You do want the girl, though.<eos> I do.
I know what you're thinking about those kids from last night.<eos> But Henry's not like that.<eos> He's a good boy, Maria.<eos> You think he wouldn't do whatever Drill asked to save your life or his mother's?<eos> We're all good, Sean, until we have something to lose.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Black out an entire city?<eos> Not the whole city, sir.<eos> Just the parts that... Do you have any idea of the panic it would cause?<eos> Oh, we do, sir.
Amen, Pastor!<eos> Because they're looking at you.<eos> Because they're looking to the church.<eos> Because they're looking to a better day.<eos> Because they're looking to a new day. Why?<eos> Because it's time to rise up!<eos> Rise up!<eos> Somebody's gotta rise up this morning!<eos> Rise up. You buy all that stuff?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I mean, none of the tickets were pre-purchased.<eos> They had to send home 20,000 people.<eos> You know, a "National Geographic" reporter who was coming through even wrote about it and he said it was undeniably spiritual.<eos> Supernatural even.<eos> It was life-changing for me.<eos> It was unbelievable.<eos> So?<eos> So, what?<eos> Did you win?<eos> No, we did not.
She is so resolved to abide by it that, in case Sir Richard should force her back again, which as her husband he certainly has the right to do,<eos> Lady Worsley wishes you to know, sir, she would do the same again whenever she could.<eos> Punk.<eos> Common whore.<eos> Well, if that is her ladyship's fixed resolution, perhaps she should give her assistance towards obtaining a divorce.<eos> I believe a divorce is what Lady Worsley wishes for.<eos> There will be no divorce.<eos> Was Jane with him?<eos> - Did you see my Mary?<eos> - No, I did not.
My lord, gentlemen of the jury...<eos> "If a plaintiff encourages or is privy to, or consenting at all, "or contributing to the debauchery of his wife, or joined in it, "he will not recover a verdict. "<eos> So says the law of this land.<eos> I rest my case.<eos> Order, order!<eos> I will have this court cleared if there is not order!<eos> Silence in court!<eos> Silence in court!<eos> Sir, does the plaintiff have your verdict?<eos> Yes, he does, my lord.
I'm moonwalking 37 miles to raise awareness for people whose ring finger is longer than their pointer finger.<eos> It's a very important cause and one that's dear to my heart, because, see, my Uncle Keith, he died of it.<eos> Jesus, that's...<eos> I'm really sorry for your loss.<eos> Would you wanna sponsor me?<eos> I mean, if you can't because of the money, that's totally fine.<eos> No, no, I have a ton of money.<eos> Oh, great!<eos> Actually, that's a lie.<eos> I don't...
I don't give a shit what Julian Twitter said.<eos> Julian Twitter's<eos> - a little bitch!<eos> - Yes, ma'am. Hey, you can tell Joey Amazon that I ordered my scrunchies two weeks ago.<eos> - Sorry, ma'am.<eos> - Next day shipping, my ass!<eos> I am so sorry for all the trouble, Mr. Pizza Delivery Man.<eos> Here's a really big tip for you.<eos> Oh, well, thank you so much, and I actually have a really big tip for you, too.<eos> - You do?
Right from the top rope.<eos> Damn, I've never done it in the top rope, that's why I'm having a hard time with that.<eos> - All right, here we go.<eos> I'm giving birth! - Aah!<eos> - I'm giving birth!<eos> That was really early.<eos> Who's gonna watch me enslave all these cute, adorable, fuzzy creaters?<eos> I said "creaters." What's a creater?<eos> Cut.<eos> Just do the other guy's line... do Ian's line?
- Come on in. - Thanks.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Uh...<eos> You know, it's under... well, it's managed.<eos> You know, it's, uh... I'm on medication, and the symptoms have disappeared.<eos> Doctor says that I am fit for duty. He even gave me a letter.<eos> I can't remember the last time I got a note from a doctor.<eos> Um, does anyone else know?<eos> I don't think that's necessary, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
Went out for a run.<eos> Tell me, why cancel the landline?<eos> It's just a waste of money.<eos> We're always on our cell phones.<eos> That's true.<eos> You must really like this. I found a whole case of it in the basement, and I hear it's pretty hard to come by.<eos> It is.<eos> Nicole and I bought that when we spent the weekend at Scarlet Hills.<eos> Chelsea really liked that, too, didn't she?<eos> She did.
Charmain.<eos> I said, sugar clam, what are you doing here?<eos> Ah, all right, put her down.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> She's alive.<eos> All right, here.<eos> Well, he ain't gonna.<eos> You do it, Charlie.
Let us never speak of him again.<eos> Well, that is fine by me, and I'm so glad you got him away from Pied Piper.<eos> I mean, now that their suit has been resolved, I think that they're about to become something really special.<eos> Their core technology, it's visionary.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Also, the entirety of their recent stumbles with Homicide, with Intersite, with the very decision to pursue video instead of more pioneering applications.<eos> This was all rooted in human error, which is why I found it prudent to secure Hanneman's shares, his voting rights, and most critically, his board seats.<eos> Right.<eos> Russ has two board seats.<eos> He did.
Your husband saved my life.<eos> When everyone else ran, he came back, and he pulled me from the rubble.<eos> He's an honest-to-goodness hero.<eos> So, instead of saving Dennis... you saved one of them?<eos> Joanne, it wasn't like that, okay?<eos> I found him when I was looking for Dennis.<eos> He was buried.<eos> He needed help.<eos> I had to help him.<eos> No, you didn't.
I'll give it to you.<eos> - The bill?<eos> - No, I didn't pay.<eos> We will request phone records to confirm that you were in the vicinity of Kungsträdgården.<eos> Because you were?<eos> It's like this.<eos> I wasn't at Operakällaren.<eos> I was with a female acquaintance in Kärrtorp.<eos> A female acquaintance who your wife knows?<eos> No, she doesn't.
"Norrell calls this the magic of the modern age.<eos> "I say it is commonplace, mundane.<eos> "I say that there is much more to English magic than this.<eos> "There is no mention of the discoveries "I have made at my peril...<eos> "No mention of the Raven King's Roads - "or why they have been hidden behind the mirrors of England.<eos> "Norrell is too afraid to question why The Raven King "would do such a thing, "too afraid to explore where those roads might lead.<eos> "Afraid it will take us to places we never intended to go."<eos> We must not let this stand. You must not!<eos> Do you really think the Raven King cares what happens to England?<eos> He does not.
Not even Lieutenant Sutherland?<eos> Who?<eos> I... I don't know any Sutherland.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> I don't know any Sutherland.<eos> He knows you.<eos> Told us all about you and your secret mission.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I don't have any secrets.<eos> I don't.
Who?<eos> I... I don't know any Sutherland.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> I don't know any Sutherland.<eos> He knows you.<eos> Told us all about you and your secret mission.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I don't have any secrets.<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't.
Whoa. Calm down.<eos> How about we go outside, and let him finish unpacking here. Fine.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> Wes, if you think I'm working with you after the shit<eos> - you pulled, you are...<eos> - Are you kid...<eos> I was just trying to help the guy make up his mind.<eos> And, hey... look how it all worked out.<eos> Yesterday you had a huge Jed problem.<eos> Now you don't.
Actually, I can think for myself.<eos> I've always said that Kai was too dangerous to become leader of the coven.<eos> You've been wasting your time with Jo.<eos> We both know she's never gonna beat him.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> -Get what?<eos> -You just cloaked me and I couldn't fight it.<eos> You're stronger than me.<eos> No, you don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
- No, not so tall.<eos> - He was a long-distance driver.<eos> - Yes, that's it.<eos> He used to go to Russia, Moldovia.<eos> I was small then. Where is Selim?<eos> He became a ball player. He's playing at...<eos> So Suat is dying, huh?<eos> What a man he was.<eos> He used to say nothing would hurt him. He died, huh?<eos> - No, he didn't.
If you don't; God speed.<eos> Because my father is dying.<eos> Got it?<eos> My father is dying.<eos> Have you not kidnapped me?<eos> - Took me here forcibly, right?<eos> - Brother...<eos> Tell me if I am wrong.<eos> Have you not kidnapped me?<eos> I did. Yes.
Let's get the hell off this rock.<eos> Uh, we've got a problem.<eos> What? The ship.<eos> It's not there. What do you mean "it's not there"?<eos> I'm telling you, it's not there.<eos> The Raza's gone.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> We lead you into this. If you hadn't taken the time to give us those weapons, you'd never been caught down here.<eos> We wanted to help.<eos> Still do.
Why would Nonna Luisa take out £6 every Thursday?<eos> Wages?<eos> There were none.<eos> Only the family worked there.<eos> Shopping?<eos> That all came out of the restaurant account.<eos> This was her personal one.<eos> Another one of her secrets.<eos> What did you say you were up to last night?<eos> I didn't.
I just need to finish packing.<eos> Wait downstairs?<eos> Milady.<eos> My Lord.<eos> I call.<eos> Three jacks.<eos> (Clears throat) Shall we keep playing?<eos> I, um... .. I seem to be low on funds.<eos> But you hold an IOU signed by my father.<eos> Yes, I do.
I shouldn't have lied.<eos> It won't help our investigation.<eos> If you and Terence were a couple long before you met Stanley, then why the need to keep it secret?<eos> Because... we were intimate.<eos> If the press ever found out, they'd gladly drag me down - all for the sake of a youthful dalliance.<eos> If that's all it was, then why keep this photograph?<eos> I forgot about it.<eos> I don't want Stanley to find out and get the wrong impression.<eos> So, your husband doesn't know about your history with Mr Lawson?<eos> STANLEY: Yes, he does.
-Have you got me on speaker?<eos> Oh, j-- josh, take me off speaker!<eos> -Hey, tom? -Hm?<eos> -Do you wanna be my boyfriend?<eos> Um, yeah, no, that's--<eos> Sorry. Yes.<eos> -What?<eos> -No, it's good.<eos> It's... -Do you not want to?<eos> -No, I do.
No, I am not--<eos> She just came out to me.<eos> Congratulations, Rose! I did not.<eos> Joshua!<eos> Well, that is inspiring. Maybe she can give you some tips, babe?<eos> She just said, "mm-mm, I love the smell of pussy in the morning!" No, I did-<eos> - Joshua! Don't tell them I said that!<eos> Tell her that her journey's an inspiration to me.<eos> Arnold thinks you've put on weight. He did not say that!<eos> He did.
Lovely friends... It's also very important for me and my legacy.<eos> So thank you, arnold.<eos> Happy birthday, buddy. Happy birthday.<eos> All right, arnold, your turn. Up you get.<eos> Um, I don't think so. - Should I do a speech?<eos> I could do a speech. - No.<eos> You will not make a speech.<eos> Thanks, everyone, for coming.<eos> Another year older. Yes.<eos> I don't...
Have you ever noticed how josh never helps his poor, sick mum clean?<eos> What's the deal with that, then?<eos> Goodbye!<eos> -Okay, bye.<eos> My mum's manic, so there's that.<eos> -How'd you meet ben? -On grindr.<eos> Then he came over.<eos> -Trust josh to try and have casual sex and then wind up in the hospital.<eos> -He outstayed his welcome, okay? We chatted, it was nice, But I told him I didn't want to see him again.<eos> -But you did.
I have been conservative in my stewardship of our holdings.<eos> The Royal Army is more creative in its accrual of assets.<eos> I feel they might take advantage of you.<eos> I think this may be too much responsibility for your shoulders at this time.<eos> - I understand, yeah. - Mmm.<eos> - You seem distressed.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> What you said makes sense.<eos> It does.
Pork for you.<eos> Do you know the hour?<eos> What in God's name...?<eos> - Dr. Charles Hallum? - Uh...<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but you have something I need.<eos> What is this about?<eos> A shipment.<eos> A bust of the king commissioned from a Miss Patience Wright in London.<eos> But I don't have it.<eos> I... I never did.
Or you give us that missing footage.<eos> Lenny dropped my name?<eos> That little bitch.<eos> Let him give you the missing footage if he knows so much.<eos> Didn't you hear the news?<eos> Lenny Simmons is a free press crusader.<eos> (Amaro) You, on the other hand, are just Scott Russo's cleaning lady.<eos> He's really worth 20 years in jail?<eos> I swear I don't have the footage.<eos> LMZ does.
So you really want me on the song?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on, we'll kill it. - Let's do it for dad.<eos> - I'll do it for dad if you do it for mom.<eos> I'll do it for them both.<eos> - ♪ Go 'head, go 'head ♪ - ♪ It's yours... ♪ You guys sound amazing!<eos> Why don't y'all come sing a chorus?<eos> - Come join in.<eos> - Do you mind?<eos> Heck no, I don't.
Great.<eos> Are you sure you don't need me to sleep with him?<eos> Or his brother or cousin or mom, dad?<eos> I thought you liked our games.<eos> Tonight just... Made me sick.<eos> Literally.<eos> So maybe you could just be a man, and get this done on your own, and not turn your wife into a geriatric whore. 'Cause I am so over it.<eos> ♪ No longer down, I'm moving up higher... ♪ You look good, Keem. Mature and so handsome.<eos> You know, you got to switch up your style sometime, you know what I'm saying?<eos> Yes, I do.
Would you?<eos> Let's take one more peek and make sure that that sucker's still in there.<eos> Yep.<eos> Why don't I read you a book?<eos> Which one do you want?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> You don't want a story, Tom?<eos> Those boys don't have daddies, either.<eos> You know, your daddy loves you very much.<eos> No, he does not.
Pete, would you shut the hell up?<eos> Nothing's the same anymore.<eos> Lights out!<eos> Three years in here.<eos> I feel like I've spent every moment of that listening to this crap.<eos> Pete had the perfect summers.<eos> Pete had the perfect grandparents.<eos> All that money from the bond business, but they loved you anyways.<eos> They had the time for you, until Mommy pissed them off 20 years ago.<eos> They did.
It's like a fairy tale in a book.<eos> Nothing even happened yet.<eos> But it did happen, Becca.<eos> It did happen...<eos> All of it.<eos> All of it happened.<eos> I told you that I was in love with someone, and what?<eos> You grabbed him out from under me, and you lied about it?<eos> I tried to tell you.<eos> I did so many times.
What's... what's going on?<eos> Just then you said you didn't kill me, and I... I didn't remember, but now I do.<eos> OK.<eos> So, on that night I went down to the lake 'cause we had a fight?<eos> Fuck, Kirstie, I'm so sorry that I didn't follow you.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> - 'Cause I stormed off.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> None of that matters anymore.<eos> Yeah, it does.
'Cause you're innocent.<eos> No-one thought so.<eos> Cops, judge, your family.<eos> Even my own... fucking parents.<eos> After a few years, I started to believe it myself.<eos> You're a good man, Kevin.<eos> But I spent half my life in jail, Kirse.<eos> So, whatever was good in me, it's been beaten out.<eos> - It never should have happened.<eos> - No, but it did.
All right.<eos> - I'm gonna do it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> Wasn't that nice?<eos> How are you gonna teach him about French cooking?<eos> I will get a French cookbook. I'll figure it out.<eos> Why don't you teach him diesel mechanics or karate or something like that?<eos> You don't think I can figure out how to help him be a French cook?<eos> No, I do not.
I don't know what he's gonna do.<eos> He is a big boy.<eos> He'll get over it.<eos> He'll move on, just like you're doing... we're doing.<eos> Yeah, I just don't know if he will get over it.<eos> It just means so much to him, and when I look back, Kristina, if you remember where I was at when we started The Luncheonette, I was terrified.<eos> I know. I get it.<eos> But, honey, you ran the numbers.<eos> I don't think you know how terrified I was when I lost my job at TNS.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You've supported us for so long, honey.<eos> And I want to see you doing something that you truly enjoy and that you're happy doing.<eos> And I see it.<eos> I see it here.<eos> You love working here.<eos> I can make money.<eos> It's just for a little while.<eos> And we'll work here together as well.<eos> I think we can do it.<eos> You do?

Okay...<eos> This is the one-hour warning For the city-wide curfew.<eos> Please return to your homes now.<eos> Ugh, I can't take it anymore.<eos> Go back to space, you crummy aliens!<eos> Hey, I thought you stopped reading that magazine.<eos> R-really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You said it was a dumb magazine for kids who play too many video games.<eos> I-I did?
Now, you tell us that you can make it out there, but your behavior don't reflect it, nor do your behavior reflect it here.<eos> Now, I think that you're destined to be prison scum.<eos> I understand that, sir.<eos> You believe in God?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Well, because that's just what I was taught, and...<eos> You were also taught that assault is against the law.<eos> Or do you think it's legitimate to go around hurting people?<eos> No, sir. I do not.
And I think most of them would say that in hindsight it was a very valuable experience.<eos> This whole experience harms me, and I mean "harms" in the present tense.<eos> - It harms me.<eos> - How did it harm you?<eos> Or how does it harm you?<eos> Is it just to think that people can be like that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I know you're a nice guy. You know?<eos> Well, you don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
Emma told me Belle confessed about knowing Anna.<eos> Still, quite the supposition.<eos> Why else would you care?<eos> Anna's a danger to you.<eos> You can't have your blissfully ignorant wife...<eos> Lose either her bliss or ignorance.<eos> Watch Anna.<eos> Make sure she comes nowhere near this shop.<eos> - But if I had the choice...<eos> - Well, you don't.
You' the one who's gonna get punched.<eos> Why am I gonna get punched?<eos> Because you set me up with a thief!<eos> Oh! So she's a hooker and a thief.<eos> Andrew, you set him up with a hooker?<eos> This company does not do that for clients anymore.<eos> No, she's not a hooker.<eos> He just thought she was a hooker.<eos> - Okay, super.<eos> - No, I didn't.
- Ivan Vaughan?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I am telling you, it is gonna happen for you.<eos> - Okay, I-I don't want you to give up on the...<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Joseph.<eos> Hi.<eos> [Sighs] I know things got off to a bad start with us.<eos> But... I still feel like we have a chance.<eos> - You do?
(chuckles) God, I loved the power.<eos> Well, my dad was a cop, so I'm a cop.<eos> That's the only reason?<eos> Well, that and the uniform.<eos> I don't like thinking about what I have to wear every day.<eos> Mailman never crossed your mind?<eos> I like the shorts idea, my head's too big for a safari hat.<eos> I'll be right back, I'm gonna run to the restroom.<eos> Hang on, you got a pass?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
- Oh, sorry!<eos> That was an accident.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> No. No!<eos> Go away.<eos> OK, OK. [straining] OK, I give up!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sorry, Daria just texted me.<eos> She wants to know if we wanna come over.<eos> - Do you?
It was around, uh, 8:00 a.m. or something...<eos> Owen, we need you to tell us exactly exactly what happened when you saw Zoey today!<eos> I answered the door.<eos> And then I pushed her away when she tried to hug me.<eos> Was she upset?<eos> Yeah, she seemed pretty pissed off.<eos> I mean... she said that I lied to her.<eos> And I was just like the others.<eos> Um... then I told her to leave.<eos> And... and she did.
Oh, crap!<eos> Science fair?<eos> !<eos> I thought you guys were just being nerds.<eos> It's both.<eos> Projects are due Monday.<eos> Monday?<eos> !<eos> I thought we had six months to think of something!<eos> We did, six months ago.
- And that annoys you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What about your father?<eos> He just drank.<eos> - And now you're punishing her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Because you don't want to become close to her?<eos> - But you want her to be close to you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm rehabilitated.<eos> I don't drink or drug no more like before.<eos> For real.<eos> Look.<eos> Clean and sober.<eos> I'm thrilled for you.<eos> Bomb at City Park.<eos> Got your old bosses written all over it.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Yes, you do.
Abraham was spying for Hewlett.<eos> No.<eos> No, it is the furthest thing from true.<eos> But you already knew that, didn't you?<eos> - Father, please.<eos> - Don't "Father" me.<eos> You knew it as well.<eos> Knew what?<eos> That your husband is a spy for the rebels.<eos> - I didn't.
No.<eos> No, it is the furthest thing from true.<eos> But you already knew that, didn't you?<eos> - Father, please.<eos> - Don't "Father" me.<eos> You knew it as well.<eos> Knew what?<eos> That your husband is a spy for the rebels.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did!
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on, let's get in my car.<eos> Shotgun!<eos> Wh...<eos> Phil?<eos> I called it!<eos> We'll just go over here.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Hey, how you doing back there?
Oh, don't even worry about it.<eos> I don't care about that thing.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Now, if had been my old<eos> VW Bug, we would've had a problem.<eos> Wait, you used to have a VW Bug?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I used to have a VW Bug!<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Cheers.<eos> If I wasn't chosen, I'd have stayed.<eos> To understand how someone can kick a 7-month-old baby to death.<eos> Who says he killed it?<eos> He says he's innocent.<eos> He said he did.<eos> At first!<eos> - Maybe the cops made him talk crap.<eos> - Too easy.<eos> First you do it, then you don't.
Kick it towards me.<eos> Get in the cell.<eos> What?<eos> I said, get in the cell.<eos> You're almost there.<eos> Come on, one more big push. - I can't.<eos> - You have to.<eos> You try doing this, you dick!<eos> - She doesn't mean that.<eos> - Yes, I do!
I have a problem that can only be solved with your wealth of expertise.<eos> - Who in the hell was that again?<eos> - That's Ava's uncle.<eos> Running is a mistake.<eos> That's how they find you.<eos> You need new papers, a new life.<eos> And what about an I.D.?<eos> You got a new I.D.? Hmm?<eos> That's the only way to get off the grid.<eos> No, I don't.
He was gonna go meet her out in the forest.<eos> You're being a pain in the ass.<eos> Somebody has to milk the cows.<eos> Besides, I'll be back in... a couple hours.<eos> I don't wanna be on the farm by myself.<eos> It freaks me out.<eos> Franny, you're 12 years old.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Besides, I don't really have much of a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
Nothing.<eos> They think I killed Lana.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> And you didn't warn me?<eos> After I found it, it was too late to text you and...<eos> Okay, well, I didn't do it, okay?<eos> You're my alibi.<eos> How?<eos> You know damn well why I didn't go and meet her.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately, I do.
- Mmm-hmm. - But sometimes I'm not so careful.<eos> Like this morning, I left the front door open.<eos> You won't tell Chuck, will you?<eos> Chuck?<eos> Chuck's my brother.<eos> He says he's my father and mother, too, because they died.<eos> He makes me hamburgers whenever I want.<eos> I can't make them anymore.<eos> Do you have a brother?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Did what?<eos> You know.<eos> Every day.<eos> You?<eos> I keep asking myself... was it 'cause of the virus... or was the virus just an excuse?<eos> You're not thinking of doing the same thing, are you, Gord?<eos> I couldn't do that to you.<eos> Then drive me into town.<eos> It was the Creekers. Yeah, I know.<eos> You do? How?
Then drive me into town.<eos> It was the Creekers. Yeah, I know.<eos> You do? How?<eos> Come here.<eos> Do you still have the geo coordinates to the tunnel? - Yes.<eos> - We're less than ten minutes away.<eos> Then we'll get you out.<eos> What about you?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
We're risking our lives to help you.<eos> We only have so much time before we could become infected.<eos> Prove to me that we aren't being sent to our deaths.<eos> Listen, I don't have time for this.<eos> The decontaminations need to happen as quickly as possible, so move.<eos> Or what?<eos> - Hey! - What are you doing?<eos> He was just asking a question.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yes, we did.
- Yeah, no.<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> You want to know why I didn't go?<eos> Here's why I didn't go, 'cause I was afraid that your parents were gonna ask us why we weren't married.<eos> That's why I didn't go.<eos> So what's the big deal?<eos> You're gonna get married, eventually.<eos> I don't know if we have to.<eos> I don't know if I want to.<eos> You don't?
Juliette?<eos> Juliette?<eos> What happened?<eos> Adalind paid me a visit.<eos> She did this?<eos> Did she hurt you?<eos> She tried to.<eos> - I'm gonna kill her.<eos> - Nick.<eos> I almost did.
Philip?<eos> Li-Na confessed.<eos> My God, to everything?<eos> Look, I wouldn't normally ask this, but...<eos> You want me to come over?<eos> It might help verify some of what she's saying.<eos> I'll send a car.<eos> All right.<eos> I think you and Finn are going to get on like a house on fire.<eos> You do?
What do 20 know about what we have planned?<eos> Julia Richmond.<eos> Sergeant.<eos> Service number... 25130581.<eos> All you have to do is tell me, Julia, what intel you have.<eos> What suspicion.<eos> If you do this for me, I will let you live.<eos> Do you have anything to live for?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
So far.<eos> I'm sure you have.<eos> You got this cool, new job.<eos> They're lucky to have somebody so dedicated and smart.<eos> That viral marketing idea, very clever.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, let me ask you a weird question.<eos> How'd you know I liked apricot jam?<eos> Everybody likes apricot jam.<eos> No, they don't.
I'll try.<eos> I see blood.<eos> Widen your lens.<eos> We need an address.<eos> There-there was, there was a man and he was trying to tell me something.<eos> I need, uh, something to write.<eos> A pen and paper.<eos> Here we go.<eos> We have an address.<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
How do you know about that?<eos> We took care of Helena, spent time with her.<eos> She said it was you that shot her.<eos> The more reason I'm doing this.<eos> You know, it's not her fault, the way she is.<eos> She's not a monster, she was just...<eos> Trained to be a killer.<eos> Does that sound familiar?<eos> How do you know she's even still alive?<eos> I just do.
Well, Jill, I've been suspended from work, so I literally have to hang around the house all day.<eos> I don't think it's a good idea for you to be here right now.<eos> I'm sure there's places you can go.<eos> - This is mad.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> No, don't apologise.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> What's it said to you?<eos> Simon has had nothing to do with this.<eos> Yes, he... Yes, IT does!
I want you to track it, please.<eos> The car is currently driving north on Brooks Street.<eos> It's noisy in here.<eos> Do you want to go outside and talk?<eos> I can hear OK.<eos> I mean, do you want to go somewhere?<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Just you and me?<eos> Erm, I do.<eos> Really, really do.
Flora.<eos> Flora Grace.<eos> There is some margarine called Flora, of course.<eos> You've put me off it now.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Don't talk to me like that.<eos> That's how men talk.<eos> ~ So you do like Grace?<eos> ~ I like Flora.<eos> You really don't.
Yes, I'm Caroline's mother.<eos> It were only the one.<eos> ~ I didn't know you smoked.<eos> ~ I don't. I used to.<eos> I just like the very occasional one now.<eos> Every...<eos> Look, last one I had were millennium.<eos> Now, when were that?<eos> ~ I thought I knew you.<eos> ~ You do.
I'm sounding like I'm making excuses, but, no, it never happened again, so...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have started talking about that.<eos> Not now.<eos> He wasn't all bad, my dad.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Right, who wants to be mother?<eos> You do.
He likes me.<eos> He loves me.<eos> It's him I should've married, all those years ago, and none of this would ever've...<eos> I'm sorry, I can't think about it now.<eos> No.<eos> Sure.<eos> You know, you were the one, that night, saying that's why it could never be a good idea, you and Robbie.<eos> What I said the next day, I was just agreeing with you.<eos> I have no memory of that.<eos> Well, no, but you did.

I can't let him down again.<eos> I thought we said we were going to pretend you never told me about Eddie.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Y'all right, love?<eos> Well, according to her mother, it's why she dropped out of university.<eos> ~ Good Lord.<eos> ~ I thought you got her through an agency?<eos> I did, she had references!<eos> The agency obviously knows nothing.<eos> Well, presumably they don't
Oh, my God.<eos> No-one's going to believe this.<eos> ~ I don't think I've...<eos> ~ It's why I can work anywhere, more or less.<eos> I draw cartoons, basically.<eos> ~ So, my God! What happened?<eos> ~ Oh.<eos> Well...<eos> This Holly sounds like she needs her arse kicking. ~ She does!<eos> She seriously does.
~ My fault?<eos> ~ Indirectly.<eos> ~ Oh, I'm dying to hear this.<eos> It was when he thought you were shagging Greg!<eos> ~ Who thought I was shagging Greg?<eos> ~ He did! John did!<eos> ~ When?<eos> When he moved in. At your house.<eos> Greg, when Greg moved in!<eos> ~ John did? !
~ Oh, I'm dying to hear this.<eos> It was when he thought you were shagging Greg!<eos> ~ Who thought I was shagging Greg?<eos> ~ He did! John did!<eos> ~ When?<eos> When he moved in. At your house.<eos> Greg, when Greg moved in!<eos> ~ John did? !<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> ~ John did? !
Dave?<eos> ~ And he can break it to him gently, all right?<eos> ~ Are you serious?<eos> I think personally, it wouldn't be a great thing to do to Robbie at this stage,<eos> ~ but if that is what you want...<eos> ~ You never wanted me to marry him!<eos> You can't keep saying that, not now!<eos> ~ Who didn't want you to marry him?<eos> ~ She didn't!<eos> Caroline didn't!

Hey. [ Strumming stops ]<eos> Is Justin around?<eos> I just came to say goodbye.<eos> All: Bye.<eos> Another thing you should know is I have a very specific face blindness when it comes to ex-girlfriends of my buddies, so I'll be forgetting who you are in three, two, one.<eos> Hey, how are you?<eos> You come here often?<eos> I know you guys are just sticking up for Justin, but my dad raised me himself.<eos> I don't really have a choice.<eos> No, you do, actually.
How long is this gonna take?<eos> Well, a hearing like this should go pretty quick.<eos> The prosecution just needs to show enough evidence for trial, so they'll keep the questions for you short and sweet.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, thanks for being here.<eos> Of course.<eos> It's okay, just keep going.<eos> Hey, man, good to see you.<eos> This your lady?<eos> Damn, Doc, you doing all right.
What?<eos> That's insane.<eos> Are you making that up just because you haven't gotten me anything?<eos> How dare you!<eos> I got you the greatest gift of all.<eos> I am writing you a song.<eos> A song?<eos> Really?<eos> Gee, that sounds like a lot of work.<eos> Yes, it does.

You see, I'll just pull out the ol' playbook from prom.<eos> Pick you up at 4:30, that way it's golden hour for photos...<eos> You know, a couple serious ones for mom and dad and then a couple fun ones for us, maybe even a jumper.<eos> Then after we eat...<eos> Oh, my God, I'm full...<eos> We'll go dance all night. And then, bing, guess what... It's midnight.<eos> We're pumpkins.<eos> My prom playbook was simple...<eos> Tried to have sex...<eos> And I did.
Lomis did.<eos> He sent it to us.<eos> He set us up to take the fall.<eos> You expect me to believe that?<eos> He didn't even show up...<eos> To collect his share of the take.<eos> Who passes up on that much money?<eos> I don't believe them.<eos> They know where Lomis is, they have to.<eos> No, they don't, Krumitz.
To finish me off?<eos> Can you pass me some bread?<eos> So, girls, your new boss?<eos> Not too mean with you?<eos> Less than you.<eos> I'm mean?<eos> No, you're nuts, not mean.<eos> So it goes.<eos> - How do you say "nuts" in German?<eos> - We don't.
Really?<eos> That sounds like such a lie.<eos> You guys sure you want to take off?<eos> You don't want to hang out?<eos> It's gonna be awesome! (door opens)<eos> I mean, we're gonna talk all about individual responsibility. (door closes)<eos> Nothing, huh?<eos> Do you know that I believe in you, Roscoe?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I do, okay?
- Did you?<eos> - Robin...<eos> I'm glad that you have your glasses back.<eos> You may express your gratitude by leaving me in peace.<eos> Look, there are some of us, we want to get out of here.<eos> We want to make a break for it, but we need to get organized.<eos> I know you can help.<eos> Don't you want to get out of here?<eos> No.<eos> I do not.
Look, maybe we could work something out. Um...<eos> How are you at waiting tables?<eos> Bad?<eos> Well, then you'll fit right in.<eos> Here, how about this...<eos> You go upstairs, take a look at it.<eos> If you like it, it's yours, and we'll work out the finer details later.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I really appreciate this.<eos> We both do.
All of it.<eos> Honey, I don't care.<eos> You're not gonna believe this, but I have a message from your son Fred.<eos> He said Henry returned.<eos> What?<eos> About an hour ago.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> All he said was, you've got Preacher James to thank.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Yes, I do.
So do a lot of "Sassy" readers.<eos> I married Bobby Sherman.<eos> - Do you think they do this to me? - What?<eos> Do you think they do this to me when they read "Sassy"?<eos> Girls don't masturbate over their teen idols.<eos> They don't?<eos> No, they make up much more intricate schematic plans.<eos> Girls are a lot more complex than boys.<eos> You don't know what girls do to each other. - Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
Where's mills and brett?<eos> - Oh, they're tied up.<eos> I mean, not literally, of course.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> - They're at chicago pd.<eos> What's the latest with terrance? - Uh... Still on the machine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, uh... You want to hear How dawson found brett and mills?<eos> - Yeah, yeah i do.
You did a really good thing bringing him onto this.<eos> I feel...<eos> I feel like I'm getting ahead of this thing.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> I got to go see a '67 Cobra.<eos> Gorgeous American car.<eos> Best we ever made.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't, um...
I feel like I'm getting ahead of this thing.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> I got to go see a '67 Cobra.<eos> Gorgeous American car.<eos> Best we ever made.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't, um...<eos> No, no.<eos> You didn't.
- I miss holding him as a baby. - Oh.<eos> You know what I miss?<eos> Johnny Carson. [Laughs] Don't you get it?<eos> We did our best.<eos> We're almost done here.<eos> Why do you think people have children when they're young?<eos> Because only the young can raise children.<eos> We can't.<eos> - Harry has problems. - Mm-hmm.<eos> He does.
Far from it.<eos> But I am more than capable of handling them.<eos> We are in a very serious crisis, and certain things have to get done.<eos> Things good men won't do.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Let's just leave it at that.<eos> And to the extent I can keep you out of it, I will.<eos> I don't need to be kept out of it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You do.
Do you know what this is?<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> The sorcerer's mansion.<eos> Henry found dozens of these blank books there.<eos> The sorcerer is here?<eos> Well, his house is, but we haven't found him yet.<eos> You're looking for him?<eos> Well, I was hoping he could... Write me a happy ending.<eos> But that book seems to have great power.<eos> Oh, it does.
I need you to get them to back off of it.<eos> Why can't you do it yourself?<eos> 'Cause I don't know the lawyer on the other side.<eos> You do. Good luck.<eos> What the hell is he talking about?<eos> - It's Scottie.<eos> - Aw, shit.<eos> I know.<eos> Scottie doesn't do favors like this, and I don't have any leverage on her.<eos> Yeah, you do.
No grown man who wears saddle shoes is without blame.<eos> This was fine when it was a victimless crime, but now there's a victim, and his stupid, stupid name is atlas.<eos> Confessing is the right thing to do.<eos> Oh. Do we have to?<eos> Can't we just blame somebody else?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Black Benny?<eos> Jakey, don't make me try to throw a drink at you again.<eos> Mm, I don't want you to do that.<eos> - Nobody does. - Mm-mm.
Catch my kisses.<eos> - Catch my kisses.<eos> - Got it, got it!<eos> Catch 'em, faster!<eos> Got it, got it!<eos> Now... one fell, one fell. Oh, oh. Five-second rule!<eos> You have a girlfriend!<eos> Heart attack!<eos> Kay's got a girlfriend!<eos> No, I don't.
So you understand.<eos> Why are you looking back there?<eos> You think they need your help?<eos> They're fine.<eos> They don't need anybody else.<eos> I'm their father.<eos> They're safe with me.<eos> Understand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Understand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> That's the last of it.<eos> Well, I guess that's all of it.<eos> If... If I let you go, they're just gonna barge in here and take everything back.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We don't.
Don't be.<eos> Thank you for bringing my stuff.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> You could have just shipped it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I was coming up this way anyway.<eos> Why?<eos> Uh, there's a horse I wanted to look at.<eos> I thought you lost the ranch.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Teddy, what... what do I do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just tell the truth, I guess.<eos> Johnny Mitchell.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Thank you, Daniel.<eos> See you next week.<eos> Did Daniel tell you why he had gone to Florida,<eos> Mrs. Talbot?<eos> He didn't.
That's good that he's leaving?<eos> That's good that you didn't have to see him 'cause he snuck over here during the middle of the day while you were at work?<eos> That's good that he has some new clothes, Janet.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Did you ever ask Teddy about his part in all this?<eos> I asked Daniel.<eos> About Teddy's part?<eos> Yes.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He didn't, really.

I'm proud of you, Daniel.<eos> For what?<eos> For trying.<eos> I saw Jon today.<eos> He told me about George Melton and Daggett.<eos> He loves you...<eos> Jon.<eos> I'm really sorry that you have to go through this again, Danny.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I do.
He loves you...<eos> Jon.<eos> I'm really sorry that you have to go through this again, Danny.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I do.<eos> But not enough?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not sure what enough is.<eos> I thought I loved someone once.<eos> Maybe you did.
How 'bout that?<eos> We're all damaged, Ted.<eos> Tawney just got an extra dose.<eos> This one's a runner.<eos> I was abused.<eos> I'm damaged goods.<eos> Lord, they pick up on them labels, don't they?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Little pitchers have big ears.<eos> They still do.
Something like that.<eos> That sucks.<eos> It does kind of suck.<eos> - Gracias.<eos> - De nada.<eos> People suck.<eos> I-I'm just sick about this.<eos> Me, too.<eos> You bought paint already?<eos> I did.
It won't take but a few hours.<eos> That's not even up for discussion.<eos> I did it, Melvin.<eos> What?<eos> The paint.<eos> Last night.<eos> The can...<eos> Just knocked it over.<eos> Well, these... These things happen.<eos> No, they don't.
The paint.<eos> Last night.<eos> The can...<eos> Just knocked it over.<eos> Well, these... These things happen.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> I'm sorry, Daniel.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I still want to pay you for the paint.<eos> I-I don't...
The old crew?<eos> Like George, for example.<eos> Or Trey Willis.<eos> Daniel Holden.<eos> Well, I...<eos> I don't know that Daniel Holden was ever a part of the old crew, or that there was even an old crew.<eos> But to your point, no,<eos> I haven't spoken to Daniel Holden since... Since high school.<eos> Did you know he'd gotten out of prison?<eos> I did, yes.
You carrying?<eos> No, I'm not carrying, Carl.<eos> Can you put your hands up?<eos> Need to pat you down.<eos> I just said I'm not carrying, Carl.<eos> We got to follow procedure, Trey.<eos> Am I under arrest?<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You want to stay here while we do this?<eos> Of course I do.
That's fair. Sorry.<eos> No.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't know what to do anymore. Is it the heart murmur thing?<eos> No, it's, um, it's an ear infection and a chest cold, and this is my life.<eos> This is what it looks like now.<eos> Well, that question you were asking before about, do I want to be involved in my daughter's life?<eos> Yeah? Of course I do.
Now, we need to get dressed, so...<eos> I don't think you're in the right place, honey.<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Just looking for a word with Mr. Crowder.<eos> I recognize you.<eos> You're Walt McCready's daughter, god rest his soul.<eos> That's right.<eos> Well, I'd offer you a drink, but we're in a bit of a hurry, so what can I help you with, Miss McCready?<eos> You know I own the Bennett land?<eos> I do.
The most expensive kind.<eos> Didn't think I'd see you here, considering who's hosting.<eos> That's exactly why I'm here.<eos> You got more balls than sense, you know that, girl?<eos> Ain't that what they say about you?<eos> It is.<eos> And maybe it's our kindred spirits that's prompting me to make the offer I'm about to make.<eos> Arlo's home and plot.<eos> You know the land I'm speaking of?<eos> I do.
Tending to his fields out there.<eos> Not tending so much as protecting.<eos> Well, I feel I should warn you. Markham's previous employees have not fared well in these parts.<eos> What?<eos> Them military jarhead guys?<eos> 'Course not.<eos> Those boys don't have no soul.<eos> They don't know what it is to really live it down.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I do not, no.
- Yeah.<eos> Gratis.<eos> Now take another loop around.<eos> Now tuck it under.<eos> Tie it off.<eos> You're gonna be tempted to leave that loose so as to allow a valiant escape.<eos> You best perish that thought.<eos> You got any duct tape?<eos> - Got some over here.<eos> - No, you don't.
No, sir, I don't.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Well... What can I do for you, officer?<eos> You can give me a ride.<eos> - This the shitbag?<eos> - It is.<eos> - Hello, shitbag.<eos> - Him there's the good news.<eos> - I don't want to hear the bad news.<eos> - No, sir, you do not.
And before you try to seduce me, just know it's been tried before.<eos> All right, now, get yourself in the Gremlin there.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Open the door.<eos> All right. Sit yourself down.<eos> And when Raylan comes back with my keys, we're gonna make the change, and it's nice in there.<eos> I got an air freshener smells like a mocha latte.<eos> - You hear that?<eos> - Uh, no, I di...<eos> Yes, I did.
We were magic.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good afternoon, Mrs. Goddard.<eos> Oh, just let me rest a bit.<eos> Me too.<eos> You all right?<eos> Has Joe said anything to you about marriage?<eos> Oh. I think he's gun shy.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I do.
Move!<eos> Unit number C1-10P?<eos> Is this one of ours?<eos> I can barely read its operating number.<eos> - This one's sealed shut.<eos> - Insurgents are loose in the sewers.<eos> Sound the alarm if you see any rebel activity.<eos> On to the next one.<eos> Spectre-5, do you actually know where we're going?<eos> Of course I do.
Hera's incoming.<eos> Everyone up top!<eos> You, too, Chop.<eos> Let it go.<eos> Chopper!<eos> He's still searching for Kanan.<eos> Move, you stubborn junk pile!<eos> You're gonna get me fried!<eos> How'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
You just put all our lives in jeopardy.<eos> I give you a direct order, and you disobeyed me.<eos> Well, it paid off.<eos> I know how to find out where Kanan is.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - Maybe?<eos> All that for "maybe"?<eos> Hera, none of us want to give up on Kanan.<eos> And you think I do?<eos> No, I don't.
Quite admirable.<eos> But what I want to know is about the other rebels, code name Fulcrum.<eos> I know nothing of a larger rebellion.<eos> And if I did, I'd rather give my life than tell you.<eos> So heroic.<eos> Just like your master.<eos> Tell me, Jedi, how did you survive Order 66?<eos> It was your Master Billaba who laid down her life for yours.<eos> Do you remember her last word to you, her last and final breath before she died?<eos> You do, don't you?
Well, my favorite TV show is "Six Feet Under," so that's probably why.<eos> I haven't seen it.<eos> You haven't seen "Six Feet Under"?<eos> ! Oh, God.<eos> You're so lucky.<eos> You know, I have the box set if you want to borrow it.<eos> Maybe we could watch it together sometime. (Enthusiastically) Yeah!<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> If you... if you want to.<eos> I definitely do.
You have a kimono area.<eos> I mean, look at this apartment.<eos> Jeremy, I feel like we're in a magazine.<eos> In a good way.<eos> It's what I like about you. I guess I just didn't realize you were judging me based on my stuff.<eos> I'm not judging you,<eos> I mean, I pegged you last night without any judgment.<eos> Why would you judge that?<eos> I didn't.<eos> And I did it on the first night.
What's your problem, Porter?<eos> I need you to help me find someone...<eos> No questions asked.<eos> All right, I'll bite.<eos> Malcolm Black.<eos> The guy we just turned over to the feds?<eos> The guy the feds just released.<eos> There's a lot more you don't know.<eos> Like he wants David Clarke dead?<eos> How did you...
[sighs] There you are.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> - Finally.<eos> - Jamie, hi.<eos> I've been... so busy.<eos> Where... have you been looking for me?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
You know, it is so awkward with our history together.<eos> Listen, I am not still attracted to you, if that is what you were worried about.<eos> I mean, obviously, you've changed, I've changed...<eos> Kristen.<eos> My gosh.<eos> [chuckles] Oh, gosh.<eos> What?<eos> You didn't think that I was talking about you and me, did you?<eos> No. [forced chuckle]<eos> I didn't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I just needed some time on my own.<eos> You know?<eos> You all right?<eos> You want to go back down?<eos> - Hungry?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't like to be sad with other people.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Neither did mommy.
You're doing great, just sitting here with me.<eos> Can you finish this sentence?<eos> "I dream..."<eos> Nothing.<eos> I never remember my dreams.<eos> How about "I want..."?<eos> I want... A time machine.<eos> Don't you want to ask me why?<eos> I think I know why.<eos> No, you don't.
I say I go to City College with a camera, shoot a really gross porno movie on their campus and put it online.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> It's very inspiring to watch you work.<eos> You are inspiring, too.<eos> In what way?<eos> I need olives, can you bring me olives?<eos> Not again.<eos> You did this a month ago.
What's true will be true, Annie.<eos> Our job is to deal with that truth.<eos> - You sound a little like Jeff.<eos> - Jeff said I sound like Abed.<eos> I wonder if Britta thinks I sound like Chang.<eos> I assume Change thinks I sound like distant explosions and crying babies, you know, he's unstable, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> Oh, a transcript for Ruffles.<eos> - You think that's our guy?<eos> - I do.
Girls.<eos> As a prison warden, I know all too well how rare stories of true rehabilitation can be.<eos> But this Dean and this prisoner stand here together today to prove that the dream is real.<eos> I'm here for the ceremony.<eos> Last name?<eos> Geller, prisoner ID 042098.<eos> Okay, go on.<eos> Have a nice night sir.<eos> Dean Craig Pelton, do you accept responsibility for any damage incurred by hiring a felon?<eos> I do.

In public, yes.<eos> We like things most people like.<eos> Our job isn't to alienate people.<eos> We're on the job with my parents?<eos> With everyone, everywhere, all the time.<eos> You wanted a relationship.<eos> A real one.<eos> It's real.<eos> Do you not think, Honda makes good products?<eos> Of course, I do.
I have been Vicki the mooooooost!<eos> I'm gonna go get a shovel, because theater is dead. Shh. Hi Starburns.<eos> Todd, you know you don't have to creep around to be weird, right?<eos> You're weird at picnics.<eos> Did you hear about the paintball game?<eos> Yeah, I heard there was no paintball.<eos> I heard it was banned.<eos> Well, you can't believe everything you hear.<eos> Okay, you just asked if I heard something and now you're invalidating the whole. Oh! Aah!<eos> Seriously, you don't?
The thing to understand about our friends is that friends isn't an adequate label.<eos> We're an intensely, intimately bonded crew.<eos> Oh, I can't, no! No!<eos> Do you want flashy forward, or cherry and classic?<eos> Do you have black?<eos> That's a no.<eos> That beleaguered sigh means, no, I can't have black nails.<eos> Don't look at the camera.<eos> You absolutely can, and we all will when our bodies decompose.<eos> Please don't Jim the camera like that.
You need people whose flaws feed into each other.<eos> It's what do you call it? Co-dependence.<eos> Synergy.<eos> For instance, there might be something Britta hates doing, but Annie loves doing.<eos> Or there might be something that Annie hates doing, but she does it anyways, because what she really loves is to feel useful.<eos> You literally just defined co-dependence. Here's to synergy.<eos> Oh, look at you. You little helper.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay, do you Garrett take Jack Nicholson to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.

You little helper.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay, do you Garrett take Jack Nicholson to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.<eos> I do, Johnny.<eos> We invented a new game.<eos> Celebrity Garrett marriage.<eos> Christian Slater to be your lawfully wedded wife.<eos> I do.
Ow! Garrett, since we met you have felt so familiar.<eos> I love making sandwiches with you.<eos> I love folding towels with you.<eos> I love giving you your pain killers, at the end of the day. Aw.<eos> Well that, those aren't really vows.<eos> That's a list of things you love about me, yeah.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay. Garrett, do you take Stacy to be your lawfully wedded wife.<eos> Stacy, do you take Garrett to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold and to honor.<eos> Yes I do.
What month are we in now?<eos> February.<eos> Yeah, that's bad.<eos> You know, it's been so long, at this point, maybe we should just float it to next year.<eos> That's what we did last year. Ugh!<eos> We're treating him like a leap-year baby.<eos> Sue's birthday...<eos> that's coming up, too!<eos> Oh, seriously, why do we have two birthdays so close together?<eos> We didn't.
Eli, he's asking that you hold the press conference for 20 minutes.<eos> Franny, this is not a press conference.<eos> This is an urgent need to stop a riot.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> No one's rioting.<eos> - You're trying to take advantage...<eos> - Seriously.<eos> The governor is stepping in for an absentee mayor in the city's time of need.<eos> You don't want to make an enemy.<eos> No, you don't.
I can get you milk, I can churn you butter.<eos> Uh, I can get you yogurt, cheese.<eos> Pretty much anything dairy is at our disposal now.<eos> Todd, you're the best!<eos> I'm gonna start calling you the milkman, milkman.<eos> Carol.<eos> With all due respect to the milkman here, who definitely deserves all this praise for basically just standing around, I found this thing, so it'll be my call what happens with it. Okay, Todd?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Phil, just because you found the cow doesn't give you the right to decide what we do with it.<eos> Uh, yes, it does.
You like that grass, don't you, little lady? Huh?<eos> I'm sorry, Phil, should we take her back to your place?<eos> Well, I'm sure she prefers my foyer, but, uh, you know, it's been a really big day.<eos> Maybe just tonight we'll, uh, let her stay here. Sure.<eos> Okay, well, let's get you tied up.<eos> My uncle taught me this knot.<eos> It's called a clove hitch.<eos> Yeah, the old clove hitch.<eos> Know it well.<eos> - Oh, you do?

Okay?<eos> You massage the teat, and then you gently tug on it.<eos> Did you really learn that on your uncle's farm or during your summers working as a male prostitute?<eos> That's a good one, Phil.<eos> Yeah, it is a risqué motion, but it gets the job done.<eos> - Milk!<eos> - We have milk!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> Anybody want a sip?<eos> - Yeah, I do!

You're in the hospital, you're getting prepped for surgery...<eos> One line of saline, wide open!<eos> GSW to the torso!<eos> Then a hand reached down and took that case.<eos> It was Khara.<eos> You saw him.<eos> What happens now?<eos> GSW to the torso!<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, y-yes, you do.
One day you'll blink... you'll be me.<eos> You know, I hate to spoil your moment of self-reflection, but what we did to you wore off hours ago.<eos> Your heroics out here-- that was all you.<eos> You don't say.<eos> I protected the president once.<eos> Thank you for allowing me to feel useful again.<eos> I wish I could say I wouldn't forget it, but, uh...<eos> There's advancements in neurological science every year.<eos> You never know.<eos> Yes, I do.
It won't bring your father back, man.<eos> It won't end your pain.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I do, and so does Max.<eos> Mike!<eos> Mike!<eos> You're a good man.<eos> Don't let him strip that from you.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> No, you don't!
Actually, she was murdered.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yeah, it was about a year or so after Alistair was killed.<eos> It was probably the same beast.<eos> Does... does she know...?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> But I don't think Heather fully grasps the unique... Reynolds family connection, if you know what I mean.<eos> He's right.<eos> I don't.
- You're actually going through with this?<eos> You're gonna blow up a New York City subway station?<eos> I thought you liked architecture.<eos> I do, Doc. It's just, uh, I like killing vampires more.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Maybe we slowed down the rate of infection too much.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> We've only done two trials.<eos> - It has to work.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
You're going out?<eos> Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.<eos> I'm taking Zack on some errands.<eos> Did you hear about Barnes?<eos> It's been all over the news.<eos> Apparently, he fell off a train.<eos> The same 1:30 train that you were on to DC.<eos> They found his body outside of Baltimore.<eos> - Did you see him?<eos> - No, I didn't.
She made spaghetti,<eos> - garlic bread...<eos> - Your favorite.<eos> It was so real. When she hugged me, I could smell her hair.<eos> You do understand that wasn't your mother who showed up at the church, right?<eos> Your mother is dead.<eos> That creature took over her body.<eos> Her one goal is to turn you.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do!
With contacts not only here, but in Albany, DC.<eos> They can still be very helpful to us.<eos> We agreed I do this my way, and I don't think that's my best move right now.<eos> - Mr. Mayor!<eos> - This is important.<eos> Councilwoman Faraldo, I worked with Nora Martinez at the CDC!<eos> Hey!<eos> Get his ass out of here!<eos> I believe you know my son, Zack?<eos> Yes, I do.
Why didn't you wake me?<eos> My God!<eos> What happened?<eos> Kelly got close, Eph.<eos> Setrakian thinks the Master has made her one of the more<eos> - sentient strigoi.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.<eos> You need to talk to him.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
Nora told me about last night.<eos> That must have been<eos> - really scary.<eos> - I think I saw Mom.<eos> - Was it Mom?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I wasn't there.<eos> Nora saw her.<eos> - Tell him, Nora.<eos> - I already did.
No, Helga.<eos> Helga.<eos> I brought you a snack.<eos> What?<eos> You're seasoning me now?<eos> No, thanks!<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Did you hear me ask,<eos> "Would you care for some pineapple?"<eos> No, you did not.
- Don't you know what knocking is?<eos> Oh, please, Sir, not in front of Her Ladyship.<eos> Well, I've been mingling.<eos> You should hear what they think out there.<eos> I have never known an interval like it.<eos> Michelangelo, William Blake...<eos> God knows who else you reminded them of.<eos> And one poor boy... an airman, head bandaged, was weeping in the stalls bar, comforted by an older man... once blonde, now gray, parchment skin and dainty hands... who went on saying, "There, there, Adrian, it's only a play.-"<eos> Which didn't seem to me any comfort at all because if it hadn't been a play, then "There, there, Adrian" wouldn't be so upset.<eos> - Michelangelo, did they?
Man, you take away that helmet and the jersey, I'm just a big dude who works down at the Chevy dealership.<eos> You're depressing the hell out of me, man.<eos> He's sweatin' over there, y'all.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> - $400.<eos> That's five.<eos> You guys mind if I play?<eos> - Nigga, do you even have any bread?<eos> - No, I don't.
Ahem. - Brother Rick.<eos> - You finally cheered up.<eos> The party is a success.<eos> Almost perfect.<eos> Almost?<eos> Man, we turned up in this bitch.<eos> - We turned up in this bitch.<eos> - All the way up.<eos> All the way. You know?<eos> I do.
What the hell is going on, Sean?<eos> Everyone's dead but us.<eos> We lost the captain.<eos> We're all alone.<eos> There's no answer from the base at faslane.<eos> How we gonna get home?<eos> Sean!<eos> We'll get home, bruv.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I do.
Our wounds, tended.<eos> Decent lodging.<eos> Fair pay and compensation as befits the soldiers of the King.<eos> Why should I plead on your behalf?<eos> You could count on our support.<eos> In the event of a change in circumstances.<eos> I don't understand you. What change?<eos> If your brother were no longer King.<eos> Do you realize I could have you hanged for talking like this?<eos> I do.
- We're gonna need entry codes, overrides, real-time monitoring of Philly PD dispatch, not to mention a few very specialized pieces of equipment.<eos> Make a list by midnight.<eos> We should have fought him harder.<eos> - You mean I should have.<eos> - No! No, I mean...<eos> With what leverage, Katya?<eos> We don't have any.<eos> Do you want to talk more about what I said to Alex?<eos> - About the affair?<eos> - No, I don't.
If Alex beats you to that laptop, you'll all be dead.<eos> All of us will be.<eos> We go at 6 A.M.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll be back as soon as it arrives.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I need a cigarette.<eos> Come on.<eos> Since when did you start smoking, Dr. O'Connor?<eos> I didn't.
You know what's missing from this pep talk?<eos> The pep!<eos> Okay, you're right.<eos> I'm an idiot. There's obviously nothing going on between Riley and Danny.<eos> So, I just wanted to apologize for the other night on the roof.<eos> Kinda caught me by surprise.<eos> Oh, no need to apologize. I shouldn't have sprung it on you like that.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no. It had just been a really emotional day.<eos> The big "I love Ben" announcement.<eos> And you really do, right?
What?<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> I saw the two of you on the roof the other night.<eos> And what did you see?<eos> Two friends who were upset that they were gonna be apart?<eos> Two friends who were worried about each other's future?<eos> Well, yeah, that's one perspective.<eos> It just seems like you have feelings for each other.<eos> And you're right.<eos> We do.

Holly's French leaving us.<eos> I'm being French leaved at my own party?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> You can't pull off the French leave with so few people.<eos> For a crowd this size, you go with the Mexican back-out.<eos> How do you think we get out of your Christmas parties?<eos> What's with the games, Holly?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wanted to be here.<eos> I really did.
She can.<eos> You about to knock her off that throne, Double G.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> ♪ ♪ My God.<eos> ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪ Are you happy with the new me you made?<eos> The new you is gonna get laid any time you want.<eos> Is everything okay in there?<eos> Yeah, everything is so good.<eos> - Do you know what EDM stands for?<eos> - Yes, I do.
That hint of bleach.<eos> Anyway, you didn't ask if you could use his goop.<eos> Malory, the whole thing about me using his "goop" was your idea!<eos> Prove it.<eos> So now let's talk about this name, Abbiejean.<eos> Don't you think she'd be better off if she were a...<eos> Malory?<eos> Thoughts?<eos> You do not want to know my thoughts.<eos> I do, Ken.
We don't have anything.<eos> You have a situation.<eos> I am going home to Japan!<eos> Well unless you wanna swim there-- which, spoiler alert, you can't, it's too far-- you're gonna need my help!<eos> Ha!<eos> Because you also need my help.<eos> Only because you just broke two of my ribs, in addition to impaling me on a bamboo stake, on which, I think we both know, you smeared some poop!<eos> I-- And if you did I don't wanna know!<eos> Because... you'd have no idea what you're supposed to be looking for!<eos> Not that I do, necessarily, but--
Really, guys?<eos> Can we not just put the past where it belongs?<eos> It was a quarter of a century ago.<eos> - Of course we can, John.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But we're still gonna need a code word for your daughter's pussy.<eos> Muff.<eos> Muff is not a code word, asshole.<eos> - They know what that means.<eos> - No, they do not.
I'll just finish that later.<eos> Hey, chief, I had an idea.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, what?<eos> Your place is a good size.<eos> We don't have a venue.<eos> What if you host our events and we split the door?<eos> Have your shows here, you mean?<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> Do, like, a five show run.
You eat that shit?<eos> Bunchy. Hmm. I'm gonna get you a new coffeemaker.<eos> It works fine.<eos> Get you one of those ones with a timer.<eos> That way you wake up, it's already brewed.<eos> How did you get me out?<eos> Will you stop with that?<eos> No, I'm worried, Ray.<eos> I owe you something, I need to know what it is.<eos> No, you don't.
I married his daughter.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Candace, put Ray at the end of the hall, please.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Oh, look who's here.<eos> Ray Donovan. Where's Father?<eos> He said to push the meeting with Mr. Liu.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know, Paige.<eos> The fuck you don't.
You've been sitting in the bar for hours getting shitfaced...<eos> - Oh, fuck you!<eos> - ...and I'm an alcoholic?<eos> Dave, enough!<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get you home.<eos> I'm looking for Tina Harvey.<eos> Drunk bitch headquarters, right there.<eos> So I hear you don't feel like performing today.<eos> No, I don't.
Bridget...<eos> I'm having a hard time, and I'm sorry if it's affecting my calculus, but I just transferred in, and my parents are at each other's throats, and my boyfriend was murdered.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have told you that.<eos> Got a medium Americano for Bridget.<eos> Ray?<eos> Tommy.<eos> How are you, Tommy?<eos> Avi told me you retired.<eos> He did, huh?
- I'm here.<eos> I just got dropped off. How do I get in?<eos> Don't move.<eos> I'm coming there.<eos> - You got this under control?<eos> - Yeah, shit's running itself.<eos> Ah, what a blessing you are.<eos> - What up?<eos> - These guys have snorted every grain of coke. We got to wind it down.<eos> No, we don't.
The intern brings in lunch every day.<eos> Lee pops a blood vessel every ten minutes.<eos> What's not to like?<eos> What if I want you back?<eos> You're a piece of work.<eos> You let the business go to shit,<eos> - you're punishing Avi.<eos> - Can't blame me for that.<eos> Yeah, well, you didn't have to punish me.<eos> No, I didn't.
I had something.<eos> Ain't that the fucking truth.<eos> You did have something.<eos> You know what you got now?<eos> You got nothing.<eos> You got fucking nothing.<eos> Well, to be more precise, you got 3% of fucking nothing, which is still fucking nothing!<eos> I'm so disappointed in you, Ray.<eos> I mean, you didn't think I'd find out?<eos> You really didn't, did you?
Please.<eos> You afraid of driving fast?<eos> No.<eos> Slide over behind the steering wheel.<eos> Keep the car running.<eos> Yeah, the old pistol-whip thing, that's some bitch shit, man.<eos> - I like the suit.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You got the money?<eos> I do.
- Who?<eos> - Romero.<eos> He just walked into the fucking club looking for you.<eos> Shit.<eos> Don't let him leave.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> That's good.<eos> What should we do with him?<eos> We have some unfinished business.<eos> No, we don't.
Don't let him leave.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> That's good.<eos> What should we do with him?<eos> We have some unfinished business.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> I need to show you something outside.<eos> You said your piece yesterday.<eos> We got nothing more to talk about.<eos> We do.
I'm gonna need my settlement money now.<eos> I'm not signing over all that money just so you can give it to somebody you just met, Bunch.<eos> Maybe he'd act more grown up if you didn't treat him like a fucking baby!<eos> Mind your business.<eos> We're in love.<eos> You better get used to me.<eos> What else?<eos> Well, yesterday I met a man, brown hair, short, seems to be in charge of running numbers.<eos> Got a name?<eos> Matter of fact I do.
Bunch, you're always gonna be my kid brother, but that doesn't mean I'm always gonna be right.<eos> I realize now how much Teresa cares about you, how strong she is.<eos> She's a fighter, Bunch, and I think everybody here can vouch for that.<eos> It just feels right looking at the two of you together because I know you're gonna protect each other.<eos> To your happiness.<eos> Yeah, go for it.<eos> I knew it!<eos> You all right?<eos> I didn't know you remembered that stuff.<eos> Of course I do.
Ina.<eos> He says he's in love.<eos> God, take it easy.<eos> We're coming.<eos> Who has a Xanax for the Uber driver?<eos> Whitney, you look very nice.<eos> - Are we leaving?<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> I thought you didn't want to go.<eos> I don't.
Who is it?<eos> It's me.<eos> C-can you come back in a bit?<eos> No.<eos> All right, hang on a second.<eos> I catch you in the middle of something?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> - This is fucking bullshit.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Don't ever do that again.
Hello?<eos> Fuck!<eos> I got a cab right here.<eos> So where am I going?<eos> The End.<eos> And hurry, my shift starts in ten minutes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So how long has that thing between you and Scotty been going on?<eos> What the fuck do you care?<eos> I don't, really.
People don't see me, Cole.<eos> They don't.<eos> I don't know, they just want to fuck me or... they don't see me.<eos> They don't care.<eos> Sometimes I'm worried I'm...<eos> that I'm not a real person, that I'm just a... a figment of people's imaginations.<eos> I...<eos> You know, when I was a child, I thought I would do something with my life, I would make a difference.<eos> I was certain of it, certain that I would matter to people.<eos> - And you do. - No, I don't.
It wasn't on the menu, but I think the chef just put the falafel in a waffle iron or something like that?<eos> She had her 21st birthday here.<eos> It was the highlight of her life.<eos> Okay, I'll see what I can do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He'll have one too.<eos> Okay, I got it.<eos> I hated that party.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, you didn't.

Okay.<eos> There's one other thing.<eos> Te amo tambien.<eos> Come in.<eos> You must be starving.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> That doesn't look like good terms to me.<eos> No, it does not.
I'm gonna do a little work right here.<eos> You know, actually, if I could put in my two cents, I've been giving a lot of thought to, uh, the role of Alison.<eos> What do you call her in the book, again?<eos> The, uh, whatever.<eos> Anyway, stick with me here, little outside the box.<eos> As Alison, Sasha Grey.<eos> How hot would that be?<eos> Mm, yes.<eos> You know who she is, right?<eos> No, you don't.
All right.<eos> Matches.<eos> Tao.<eos> Say your piece.<eos> You forbid Mei to work.<eos> No women on the railroad, plain and simple.<eos> The men will ask questions.<eos> I'll keep a tight lip, but that's as far as I go with this.<eos> Now light the damn fuse.<eos> She does good work.
Is this it?<eos> Must be.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Did you bring it?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Throw it here.<eos> It's all there.<eos> We've been trying for so long.<eos> You're sure this will work?<eos> It always does.
- Great job, Russell!<eos> This gives new meaning to the phrase:<eos> "Hair of the dog that bit me."<eos> Hey, Russ, way to go, pal.<eos> Who has the gravitas now, baby?<eos> Russell!<eos> - Russell, he's coming!<eos> Russell!<eos> - Now you see me.<eos> Now you don't!
- Okay.<eos> - C...<eos> - Mm-hmm. - O...<eos> Okay.<eos> M.<eos> And what do I do?<eos> I just type that into Google?<eos> Yep.<eos> Boy, she really knows this stuff, huh?<eos> - She does, actually.
- I just want to sit and talk. - Oh.<eos> - The thing is, Forrest...<eos> - I've decided that what would be best for me, and for Eric-- would be best for both of us,<eos> (Forrest voice-over) This was terrible news, but given the parameters of this review, there was only one way to react.<eos> - Yay. [laughs]<eos> - Yay?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I think it's--<eos> - I think that's great.<eos> - You do?
- The thing is, Forrest...<eos> - I've decided that what would be best for me, and for Eric-- would be best for both of us,<eos> (Forrest voice-over) This was terrible news, but given the parameters of this review, there was only one way to react.<eos> - Yay. [laughs]<eos> - Yay?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I think it's--<eos> - I think that's great.<eos> - You do?<eos> I do. I do, I do, I do, I do.
- Dad hid something in our heads and it needs us all to make it work. - What is it?<eos> I think it's a way to give consciousness to other Synths.<eos> Can you imagine a whole load of new ones being made?<eos> - I mean this changes everything.<eos> - Does it?
- I can't fight it!<eos> - Hobb did something to you...<eos> - Joe, now!<eos> Don't bother running a trace.<eos> I won't be on long enough.<eos> We know what you did to Fred.<eos> You'll never see any of us again.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I have the code your father used to make them.<eos> No, you don't.
- Don't kill our family.<eos> Look at Leo, he'll die too.<eos> You were made for him.<eos> He didn't want me.<eos> He does now.<eos> He wants Beatrice.<eos> I'm not her.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> She didn't have a choice.<eos> You do.
I won't.<eos> The other offer's still on the table if you change your mind.<eos> You know I'm a lot more persuasive when I get what I want.<eos> I'm sorry I wasn't able to get to angelica in time.<eos> I'm sure you did everything in your power to help her.<eos> You were the last one in the tunnel today.<eos> Yes.<eos> That special book, the one on my desk, you didn't see it, did you?<eos> No, mother, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't.
Or what?<eos> You're gonna kill me?<eos> Just like you killed those people on that boat?<eos> Do you know how to get to Azra or not?<eos> But between my book and your compass, we can figure it out.<eos> What happens to you when you can't control your power?<eos> I can.<eos> You saw it at the parley.<eos> How do I know you weren't lucky?<eos> You don't.
There's new trains coming every day.<eos> You have information about the case?<eos> My brother does.<eos> Gabriel.<eos> He's a psychic.<eos> There's a thing inside you.<eos> Your cure will come with the number three.<eos> I didn't know where you were.<eos> You knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
Look, you know, old job's over.<eos> New job hasn't begun.<eos> You know, I'm just spinning my wheels here.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> So, um... We wanted you to be the first to know.<eos> Um... Yeah.<eos> We're getting married.<eos> Hey! I told you.<eos> No, you didn't.
No big deal.<eos> It's not like we're hiring a caterer.<eos> We don't have a gift registry or anything.<eos> Sure. Okay.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Well, I have to get you a ring.<eos> I already have one.<eos> That is for us.<eos> You need one for you.<eos> I do? You do.
Freeze!<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> And see how much better things turn out when you're honest with me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> No hard feelings.<eos> Patrick, do you take Teresa to be your lawful, wedded wife, to have and to hold in sickness and health, for better or for worse, till death do you part?<eos> I sure do.<eos> And, you, Teresa, do you take Patrick to be your lawful, wedded husband, to have and to hold in sickness and health, for better or for worse, till death do you part?<eos> I do.
Peterson's careful.<eos> He wouldn't make any accusations if he didn't have the evidence to back it up.<eos> I shot a man.<eos> Bullet's in the body.<eos> Peterson found the corpse, dug out the bullet, all he's got to do is subpoena the gun, and...that's game over.<eos> I need to call Lena.<eos> I'll let you do that.<eos> What does he think Peterson has on him?<eos> The bullet.<eos> Well, if he does, then Abbott's toast.
I know it's disgusting.<eos> My dad normally has the honors, but...<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cup your hands and then pound on my chest like this.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You've got to do it harder.<eos> You've got to knock all the stuff off the walls in my lungs.<eos> I-I don't...
Big deal.<eos> It's freaking normal.<eos> It doesn't mean you're weird or that there's anything wrong with you.<eos> - It doesn't?<eos> - No!<eos> No.<eos> What makes us not animals is that we make choices.<eos> You can't help what you think, what your impulses are.<eos> We all have crazy ones.<eos> I do.
Mom, Dad, um, that's my date.<eos> What it is.<eos> You know this clown?<eos> Mr. Winthrop, I would like... to ask for your daughter's hand in being my girlfriend.<eos> But... before I do that, I have to come clean about some very dastardly deeds that I have done.<eos> I've gotta be real. I've gotta be honest,<eos> - and I've gotta be open...<eos> - He doesn't.<eos> - with everyone in the church!<eos> - You don't, you don't.
We don't have time for that.<eos> You can have soup after I clean your ear, but then you have to go.<eos> Beautiful point.<eos> Can we play?<eos> I'm gonna be late for work.<eos> Just one game.<eos> How about that shower now?<eos> Okay.<eos> I see you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You don't get TV. Oh.<eos> You're the cop who shot me.<eos> Lieutenant Koto.<eos> I thought I killed you.<eos> I wish you had.<eos> Then why did you wear Kevlar?<eos> A shot to the heart would have been too messy.<eos> That's not the way I wanted to go out.<eos> You wanted a head shot.<eos> I still do.
Hey.<eos> There is nothing to worry about.<eos> I'm just giving one of my former students some advice.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jamie, stop it.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I know you.<eos> - I know you.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
W-what?<eos> Even if you could tell us what other kids he might have been with that day?<eos> I mean... oh, now I'm supposed to get myself killed to fix what y'all did to my family.<eos> I understand that that's how your feel, but you and Jalil would qualify for witness protection.<eos> [ Sighs ] You could move away somewhere, somewhere safe.<eos> [ Pounding on door ]<eos> Y'all need to go.<eos> I can't have the police here.<eos> [ Dog barking in distance ]<eos> How you doing, Mrs. Thompson?
I did.<eos> Thank you, inspector... For everything.<eos> Judge: Ms. Nelson.<eos> Inspector, you said you shot the gun from Dustin's hands.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Was that your intention... To knock the gun away?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Why not shoot him in the head?<eos> Did you not have a clear shot?<eos> I did.
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... you know, it has been a lovely adventure, hasn't it?<eos> But should we head back and truffle up our dinner?<eos> We could, or...<eos> I know a fantastic hot spring about 15 minutes up the road.<eos> We could hike.<eos> Oh, well, we don't have our bathing suits.<eos> Neither did Adam and Eve.
I couldn't wait to get back to the Upper East Side.<eos> And then I met you.<eos> And I didn't want to leave.<eos> - Your mother won't know if you stay the night.<eos> - Have you met my mother?<eos> She'll know.<eos> - She hates me.<eos> - What?<eos> That's not true.<eos> - She does.
We're in Manhattan.<eos> It is possible to buy more here.<eos> So why did you call me, not mom?<eos> Mom doesn't pick out my shirts.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You mean as of tonight when I'm doing it instead?<eos> I don't have great taste. So what?<eos> I'm just giving you a hard time.<eos> I knew that.<eos> No, you didn't.
Excuse me.<eos> - Spence.<eos> - I said talk to Vernon.<eos> Only Vernon.<eos> Yo, fuck you, man. When it come to dollars, I go wherever he go.<eos> - What the fuck did you just say to me?<eos> - Hey, come on, chill, Spencer.<eos> You know I don't talk money without Reggie.<eos> - You hung up on Jason.<eos> - No, I did.
Joining me in the dragon's den?<eos> Just visiting.<eos> Like you.<eos> I'm not visiting.<eos> I'm a resident.<eos> There's work here I believe in.<eos> You took a hit.<eos> You took it to heart.<eos> You have other choices.<eos> We all do.
Alec?<eos> Clear.<eos> Clear. Move.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Identify yourself!<eos> Do it slowly.<eos> Get back up in here!<eos> Let's go, let's go! He's out!<eos> You really think you're worth it?<eos> Somebody does.
Get out of here, bone-ugly thing.<eos> I am working on becoming a more spiritual person.<eos> And I mean, I am working on it.<eos> I am working on finding a peaceful person inside me.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, it's a daily investment.<eos> Um, and I am good with the expletives and the superlatives and I know I am a quality imperfect soul, but good god almighty, I try, you know.<eos> I put up an awful lot with Vicki.<eos> If these 12 fucking dogs are any indication.<eos> But we have beautiful children.<eos> Oh, my god... you do.
I don't know.<eos> He got a money order for cash.<eos> - Maybe it's some sort of payoff.<eos> - The same day he was killed?<eos> The same day Jay Butler disappeared.<eos> Did you know that because of all the pollution, the bass are changing sexes,<eos> - with the males carrying the eggs? - Oh.<eos> It's about time.<eos> - You did not know that.<eos> - Yes, I did.
- A what?<eos> A swamp spirit from Slavic folklore.<eos> - It was supposed to be temporary.<eos> - It's not?<eos> Korsak keeps finding ways to tell me I've screwed up.<eos> It's been redrawn a bunch of times.<eos> How long have you had it?<eos> - [Elevator bell dings] Six months.<eos> - Oh, my god. We should all know better than to bet with Korsak.<eos> Well, I do now.
[Inhales deeply] We found this receipt for coumadin.<eos> As it turns out, it was your credit card that paid for it.<eos> - So?<eos> - So that means you knew about it.<eos> Well, I don't understend where this is going.<eos> Mark entered eight tournaments.<eos> You were not an official for two of them,<eos> - where he finished 83rd and 95th.<eos> - It happens.<eos> Yes, it does.
Well... even if she was guilty, Susie was smart.<eos> She wouldn't want a criminal to know where she lived.<eos> I mean, she had to have been followed from somewhere.<eos> But there was no sign of forced entry.<eos> A-And she never would've let someone in she didn't trust.<eos> No.<eos> And there was no record of a call to set up a meeting.<eos> Well, unless she had a burner and they took that, too.<eos> Janie, I-I don't want to believe that she was crooked.<eos> Nobody does.
Please. I'm ...<eos> I'm just a kid.<eos> So was Sheila MacIntyre.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Lewis was right.<eos> Sheila MacIntyre was familiar.<eos> She was a patient of another doctor in Foley's medical suite with a Thursday appointment.<eos> - How did we miss that?<eos> - We didn't.
We heard he was pretty upset about it.<eos> I assured him that he would be paid, every cent.<eos> Would you mind telling us where you were<eos> - between 5:00 and 6:00 this morning?<eos> - He was right here.<eos> We both were.<eos> We practically live here.<eos> Though it's obvious we're not talking as often as we should be.<eos> There's security footage if you want to see it.<eos> We do.
- I assume nothing bad happened to him, or you would've been much more compassionate.<eos> Your father is buddy-buddy with a murder suspect.<eos> Okay, really?<eos> We're just not gonna talk about this at all?<eos> - Talk about what?<eos> - The fact that "your father"<eos> and "murder" are in the same sentence.<eos> We talk about murder all the time.<eos> Okay, it's obvious that something is going on between you and your father and has been for a long time... because you have absolutely no poker face.<eos> Yes, I do.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Uh, we need to talk.<eos> What is wrong?<eos> There was a meeting ...<eos> me, Maura, Mom.<eos> And Mom has decided that she should move in with me so that you can live with Maura.<eos> - Okay.<eos> That works.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> It does not!
You better hide your secret tiny, tiny porn.<eos> Um... Wow. You weren't kidding.<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Okay. What's up?<eos> What I say cannot leave this room.<eos> What you say cannot fit in this room.<eos> When I was 14, my best friend, uh, Carice Jaquard... she lived next door.<eos> And one day, she didn't show up for school.<eos> So on my way home, I thought I would stop by, see if she wanted to know what the homework was.<eos> Mnh, she didn't.
- Right?<eos> - Look at that face. - Aww.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> I wonder if whoever tried to kill him knows that he's still alive.<eos> When is his competition that he's supposed to be in?<eos> Every day this weekend at the Convention Center.<eos> And all three of Duke's rivals are gonna be there.<eos> We slip backstage using Duke and catch them off guard in their own turf?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Hey. Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.

Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> He does.
He's driving down from Connecticut tonight and he wants to see you.<eos> So if I were you, I'd maybe take him up on it.<eos> I'll consider it.<eos> - He's pretty cute. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Jonesy, round of drinks over here.<eos> Hey, Boss.<eos> How'd it go, Lieutenant?<eos> How's Bullman holding up?<eos> He got lucky.<eos> He and Muldoon both did.
What did you two talk about exactly?<eos> You know, just how I feel about you.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Why am I scared to hear this?<eos> Why would you be scared?<eos> I just think we have different expectations, that's all.<eos> How so?<eos> About what this could be.<eos> Hey, I think this could be something serious.<eos> - I do.
He was gonna come in and kill my dad, kill my mom, kill me and my sisters.<eos> Until one day my dad comes home from work and says we don't have to worry about this skell anymore because it's been taken care of.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Your father killed him?<eos> Well, as he explained to us that night...<eos> There are certain things you have to do to protect your family.<eos> Well, what if it's the other way?<eos> What if you were the one who got killed?<eos> No, no, that wasn't gonna happen.<eos> No, but what if it did?
Wait a moment.<eos> - Have you found something?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - It's not very good?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Because according to the police report he had 80 joints on him at the time of arrest.<eos> And... There's a shirt pocket and two back pockets even though Thomas taught us never to put joints in your back pocket.<eos> So if all the pockets were packed, then he could have had 42 minus a wallet, 32 joints on him at the time of arrest.<eos> - What if he had a bag?<eos> - He didn't.
You can go to the bank tomorrow.<eos> Now I think she's asleep.<eos> - I thought of clearing up a bit.<eos> - No. We need a working atmosphere.<eos> - It provides a good atmosphere.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Here.<eos> I have coffee and tea, if we need it.<eos> - It doesn't matter. Do you have wine.<eos> - No, I don't.
- Martin, I was with my father!<eos> What did you tell him?<eos> That it was from you, because we had shagged.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Going home.<eos> Thanks for tonight.<eos> - Have you worried about it at all?<eos> - Does he know?<eos> Bye.<eos> No, he doesn't.
"The futility of lighting candles only to blow them out immediately is just one reason I find children's birthday parties impractical."<eos> - Holt.<eos> - That's Holt.<eos> Mm, fake.<eos> I say fake too.<eos> I don't remember saying it, so it must be fake.<eos> It was real!<eos> (All) Oh! To Terry's kids at their birthday party.<eos> Oh, I remember now.<eos> Oh, do another one.
- Holt.<eos> - That's Holt.<eos> Mm, fake.<eos> I say fake too.<eos> I don't remember saying it, so it must be fake.<eos> It was real!<eos> (All) Oh! To Terry's kids at their birthday party.<eos> Oh, I remember now.<eos> Oh, do another one.<eos> Do another one.
- You could have killed him.<eos> - No.<eos> Just get off me!<eos> - Okay?<eos> - No, I'm not okay!<eos> I'm pregnant!<eos> I'm fucking pregnant, okay?<eos> You know, you have a real anger problem.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Carla?<eos> - So, what do you say?<eos> - Well...<eos> I'll give you... $60 for them.<eos> For all of them?<eos> Sixty?<eos> - Do you need money?<eos> - I don't need money from you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Because if you do...
You take your stained books and get out of my café.<eos> - I don't want them.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> I don't want you to have them.<eos> Take your 60 bucks, shove it up your ass!<eos> Could I just have the hot sauce?<eos> Give me that sack.<eos> Give me that goddamned sack!<eos> Why are you acting like the last four months didn't mean anything?<eos> - Because they didn't.

- What do you do?<eos> - We do vacuum aspiration.<eos> It's less traumatic to the uterus.<eos> - Guess it's not the Dark Ages anymore.<eos> - No.<eos> - How much is it gonna hurt her?<eos> - It'll be a bit uncomfortable.<eos> She might cramp a fair amount afterwards. - But the procedure shouldn't hurt.<eos> - Mine hurt.<eos> Mine did.
I don't dislike you.<eos> And in some odd way, I think I respect you more than I've ever done.<eos> I believe what you said about wanting to help her in the first place.<eos> And it was my fault, really, that she was so desperate.<eos> But this has made a difference, hasn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sheila I'm not defending him, but, um... the fact is...<eos> - young men...<eos> - Gerald knows what I mean.<eos> Yes. I do.
Hey, about that book...<eos> There are limits to what I can teach.<eos> I'm sure there are even better teachers.<eos> Where?<eos> Ren-kun, would you like to go to university?<eos> That's...<eos> I'll help you with the entrance exams!<eos> But me going to university...<eos> Don't you want to know more about the things you don't know?<eos> I do.
Really?<eos> Uh... actually, I've been meaning to talk to you about something.<eos> Um, this is the real reason I made the trip.<eos> And I'm glad you did.<eos> And I want you to know that no matter what it is, I am... I'm supportive.<eos> I've been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.<eos> What?<eos> I have dementia.<eos> Early stages, but I've got dementia.<eos> No, you don't.
Good.<eos> That's for the wi-fi.<eos> That's for your kid.<eos> I'm a dad, too.<eos> Now beat it. (Door bells jingle) Don't ask me to be sorry.<eos> You have to hear what I have to say, and if you still feel the same afterwards, then... fine.<eos> I love you so much for your concern...<eos> But there's nothing we can do about this.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
"The man who brought down Lucas Reem."<eos> Well, that line may work at a last call hookup, but I'm afraid the truth is not quite so heroic.<eos> You know this guy?<eos> I do.<eos> He's all over the case files.<eos> Todd Spanna had an apartment across from Lucas Reem.<eos> One night, he sees Reem hosing blood off his hands, so he calls the cops, turns him in, ends Lucas Reem's run.<eos> Well, it looks like he's turned that into a little celebrity for himself.<eos> Did a couple of talk shows. I think he even wrote a book?<eos> Yes, he did.
I wanna check on your mother.<eos> Mind dropping me at the loft on the way back?<eos> Dad...<eos> Are you sure everything's okay?<eos> Emma, of course.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You found that in Cruella's car?<eos> David, that belonged to Maleficent,<eos> - you know how much that meant to her.<eos> - I do.
Please... Let me be a man.<eos> Why didn't you bring him?<eos> Everyone brought their date.<eos> He can't come?<eos> Tonight's biggest issue was your date.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Because everyone describes a different person.<eos> They're just curious.<eos> But... You do have a man... Right?<eos> I do.
Thank you.<eos> I hope I'm not overstepping, but, uh... I can't help but to be curious about what Jacob said about your mother making his aunt just disappear.<eos> I mean, is that even possible, for someone to make a returned person disappear?<eos> Apparently so.<eos> But why?<eos> I mean, she'd have to have a reason of some kind.<eos> In her deranged logic, she probably thought she was protecting Fred.<eos> She cloaked all of her terrible behavior under the guise of protecting her family.<eos> Well, I know how hard it can be to turn the other cheek.<eos> I really do.
Is Ravi here?<eos> I couldn't get in my place, I think he changed the locks.<eos> Hey.<eos> Good to see you out and about, mate.<eos> Hey, get your butt in here and help us eat all this food.<eos> Yeah, I've been eating a lot of stuff that requires spoons for the past week so, um...<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Did you know there were two General Tsos, both from the Qing dynasty?<eos> This dish was named for the one that suppressed the Dungan Revolt. No.<eos> But I do now.
You ever spend time around a toddler?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Like, "No, no, no, no!"<eos> It's the same thing with these cons.<eos> Some gangster wants something that belongs to you, get him saying yes, and watch the resistance just fall away.<eos> Okay, first question.<eos> Let's start with the personal...<eos> Alicia?<eos> Your law partner recently pleaded guilty to a drug charge.<eos> Mr. Prady, do you have a question for Alicia about this?<eos> I do.
That's great news.<eos> We may need Peter's help if this doesn't work.<eos> I know, I'm ready to call him.<eos> All right, wait.<eos> Uh, that's somebody on my other line now.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, Diane, this is Eli.<eos> Eli, I don't have time right now.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
Your plea.<eos> The Brady violation.<eos> Uh... wha...<eos> It, um... okay, uh, I... let me call you back.<eos> Your Honor, we would like to subpoena the backup drives of the CPD's Fourth District.<eos> This is completely unnecessary, Your Honor.<eos> Detective Prima stated on the record he never received an e-mail from Toronto.<eos> Then he shouldn't mind us taking a look at the backup.<eos> You know you only have four hours left, Counselor?<eos> I do, Your Honor.
And if I were you, Ms. Lockhart, I would race<eos> - out of this court right now.<eos> - Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Oh, we're in.<eos> That's CPD's server.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Now, can you access the individual e-mail archives?<eos> Mm... I can access anything, Kalinda.<eos> Good, 'cause I need positive proof that he received this e-mail.<eos> Nope, he did not.
Crossing Bartlet.<eos> Proceeding northbound.<eos> One-David-One.<eos> Crossing Temple. We still got a visual on the suspect vehicle?<eos> Copy that, One-David-Ten.<eos> All units, be advised, suspect vehicle is continuing north on Everly Boulevard.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> It's probably best if we don't talk.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
-Okay. Okay.<eos> Sarah: Hey, art.<eos> No, that's detective bell to you. Wow.<eos> Back on the job? Congrats.<eos> Yeah, well, two days in and i'm already questioning it. -Hmm.<eos> -Listen, a woman came in Complaining about an incident<eos> -At a hotel last night. -Yeah?<eos> And when i saw a photo of the suspects,<eos> Sarah, they look like that prolethean freak, mark.<eos> They both do. Cal:
I've done quite enough already.<eos> No. Nonsense.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Look what i've got.<eos> -What is that?<eos> -It's a clean cell.<eos> For contacting your dodgy friends.<eos> For scheming and manoeuvring, Setting things in motion...<eos> I have no use for it.<eos> Yes, you do.
Um, now we find helena and we finish this shit.<eos> -How?<eos> -Sarah: Castor has her.<eos> So we go to the one we know, mark.<eos> Okay?<eos> Mark?<eos> -Mark, are you all right?<eos> -Go back to sleep.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> -(water running) -i'm almost done.
Be strong, my little urchin.<eos> What is it?<eos> I need your help with something and it's really important, so I don't want any quivering.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I want you to take me to Rachel.<eos> What?<eos> If anybody knows about castor, it's going to be her.<eos> I'm not authorized.<eos> I'm not even supposed to know where she is.<eos> Yeah, but you do, don't you?
- What?<eos> Why not?<eos> - Because, Donnie... conspicuous spending is the surest way to attract the attention of the authorities.<eos> Cars aren't conspicuous, Alison.<eos> They're, like, everywhere.<eos> There's only one way to launder money.<eos> You pay taxes on it.<eos> You guys need a front, and I'm sorry, Allie, but your garage-made soap's not going to cut it.<eos> - I... I have a plan.<eos> - You do?
You need to stop this.<eos> - I'm married.<eos> - I know.<eos> Hey, marriage is complicated.<eos> I'm safe.<eos> No one needs to know.<eos> No, no.<eos> This is a business relationship.<eos> If this has become something else in your head... maybe you're grasping at something you never had.<eos> I did, though, didn't I?
I just gotta go.<eos> I'll call you later, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Shit!<eos> We're closed.<eos> Okay, yeah, all right, okay, I hear you.<eos> Come in.<eos> That looks like it hurts.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> I did.
- Please.<eos> Siobhan, I've got something for you.<eos> Listen, I'm just round the corner, so ask the barmaid for directions, yeah?<eos> Terrance.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Ferdinand.<eos> You scared the shite outta me.<eos> I thought that you were going to call me if Siobhan Sadler ever came to town.<eos> We had an understanding.<eos> Yeah, we did.
It's Siobhan.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> Where are you?<eos> A few blocks east of the Bayonet.<eos> In the square, in an hour.<eos> I'll send someone.<eos> Great.<eos> That doesn't sound ominous at all.<eos> You don't have to come.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm okay.<eos> Just... What if it's just for intel?<eos> She could be a safer alternative.<eos> Don't count on it.<eos> Katie was real to me -- living, breathing --<eos> Until the rug got pulled.<eos> We can't let anything compromise our mission in d.C. Tomorrow.<eos> Don't introduce even a possibility of lexi To your mind, to your heart.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You okay?<eos> yeah.<eos> It didn't penetrate the glove.<eos> Well, i'm guessing that's the stuff they want me to deliver.<eos> We need to test it.<eos> How?<eos> On what?<eos> I don't know, but we cannot take that with us Until we know more about it.<eos> How do we know it'll work on the espheni?<eos> - We don't.
And you could still be critical to our objective.<eos> I've been given some time back, dad, A chance to fight for more, Experience the life you gave me the way i was meant to.<eos> We've both been given a second chance.<eos> It's important that we make it count.<eos> So this little guy has been struck twice, And still nothing.<eos> You think the same applies for us?<eos> Maybe.<eos> When this thing snatched our new formula Back into its capsule, It suddenly became non-lethal.<eos> How do we know this does not disrupt the ingredient Lethal to the espheni?<eos> We don't, not yet.
He has four of them.<eos> He said he hopes they all become fighters, like him.<eos> And you think that's a good thing?<eos> What?<eos> I felt for him and his kids, fighting this brutal, horrendous war.<eos> I mean, it's horrible, but it's... admirable in a way.<eos> It's brave.<eos> They don't have a lot of choices.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
You should see her after a fight. [chuckles]<eos> She collapses onto the canvas like she's given it all she's got.<eos> Crowd just eats it up.<eos> I'm gonna keep you for observation, Kara.<eos> A quick word?<eos> We can keep them separated for now, but, um, this rivalry seems to be problematic.<eos> Well, there's nothing wrong with a little healthy competition.<eos> Yeah, I think the key word there is "healthy."<eos> And, uh, Tammy over there doesn't seem to know when to stop.<eos> No, she doesn't.
This isn't how I ever imagined it... you know, doing it on my own.<eos> But it's happened, and I can do it, right?<eos> Of course you can do it.<eos> I just keep hearing my mom's voice saying,<eos> "you can't have it all."<eos> A job and a kid is not having it all.<eos> It's just two things.<eos> And besides, you won't be alone.<eos> You have phenomenal friends.<eos> I do.
Shouldn't you be in school?<eos> It's teacher-development day.<eos> I'm calling social services.<eos> How are things with your foster family?<eos> They eat rabbits.<eos> Well, you can't stay here.<eos> There's a dust vac over there if you'd like to clean up your crumbs.<eos> Hi. Can I speak with Mr. Perez, please?<eos> You said you were coming to Leila's funeral.<eos> You never did.
It means I'm thinking you're liking being disembodied a little bit too much.<eos> I get to be me here, do all the things my mind tells me to do, and nobody looks at me funny.<eos> Yeah, but you're still being led by the voices in your head.<eos> I can't really explain it.<eos> I have a whole other relationship with reality.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Oh, I think you'd be surprised.<eos> My compulsions tell me they're keeping me safe.<eos> They didn't work today.<eos> No, they didn't.
Debbie from Des Plaines.<eos> "Dear Dr. Masters and Mrs. Jonathan."<eos> You have to admit, that's a pretty promising start.<eos> "I cannot stop thinking about the wickedness of your book.<eos> The pictures come into my head, and they will not leave me-- Men and women in all their nakedness.<eos> Hands reaching, groping, skin quivering with lust, yearning to be touched.<eos> A whispering so close to your ear that you can feel the hot breath tingle down your spine--"<eos> This does not mean that I forgive you.<eos> I didn't ask you to forgive me.<eos> Well, I don't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I was just watching you and thinking... thank God for Libby Masters. Oh.<eos> You've been so kind to Joy and beyond generous to me.<eos> Over these past few months, if it hadn't been for you, I don't...<eos> Of course.<eos> Anything for friends.<eos> Your mother's rocking the baby, humming "Chattanooga Choo Choo"...<eos> Honey, Lisa lapped up every last drop of that ice cream--<eos> Did you know she was going to do that tonight, throw Bill at me in that way?<eos> You did.
A trick, essentially.<eos> I mean, isn't it a trick?<eos> You're trying to manipulate a person into feeling a sexual attraction for someone whom they might not, in actual fact, be attracted to at all.<eos> Or you could say I'm developing a product customers want.<eos> I doubt many customers want to be duped into falling in love.<eos> I think what we all want is to uncover the essential link between scent and human sexual response.<eos> Well, that might be what we're interested in,<eos> Virginia, because our work is the work of scientific inquiry, but I think Mr. Logan has other interests.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
All right, but... hotels are out since the book has now made us recognizable.<eos> We can't use your house because your parents appear to have taken up permanent residence.<eos> I guess there's always the car.<eos> You know, the point of this evening was not to make you sigh-- in despair, anyway.<eos> It's like we've been forced back to ground zero.<eos> Another version of the Wash U lab where we first had sex.<eos> "Ground zero" makes it sound unnecessarily grim.<eos> Starting a relationship in a lab is hardly a proper courtship.<eos> We had a courtship.<eos> We did.
I'm good, thanks.<eos> It's funny.<eos> For years, I've been making coffee for two, and I haven't quite mastered the half pot.<eos> Seems obvious, you know?<eos> Half the water, half the coffee, and yet it's either too weak or too bitter.<eos> Uh... yeah, I'm, uh... I'm afraid so.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You have any kids?<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> I do.
That's not going to happen.<eos> But she hopes it does.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Hope it does?<eos> All right, let's just sit down and take a breath.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Don't you want him to love you more?<eos> The truth.<eos> I do, yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
And I have become an expert at looking the other way.<eos> Maybe it's your turn to do the same for me.<eos> Sorry about that. Yeah.<eos> We can do 9:15.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> So, what do you tell him?<eos> Bill... when he asks what you've been doing all day?<eos> He doesn't.
First of all, it should be marketed towards women, not men.<eos> A perfume that a woman could put on to help her feel more sexual, perhaps even awaken a whole part of herself that's been dormant or repressed.<eos> You know, it is what's happening out there in the real world-- a sexual awakening.<eos> That's exactly right.<eos> So, if we could tailor this research and turn it into a perfume<eos> - for women...<eos> - But--<eos> Give women a sense of power so they can take charge of their own lives.<eos> "Do I want to feel sexy and aroused tonight?<eos> Yes, I do."
If I just tried harder, maybe none of the bad stuff would happen.<eos> I-I do understand.<eos> And I hope you know that whatever you did, it wouldn't have made any difference.<eos> I know that now.<eos> And I know... that I have love to give and that I have a kind heart and I was meant to share it.<eos> And it's only sometimes, very rarely, that I go back to that old me, and I think I have to do what people say or they won't love me.<eos> And so, just then, I slipped.<eos> But it was just a slip.<eos> And it's not the me I am now, if that makes any sense.<eos> It does.
In fact, Bill has a very lovely wife.<eos> Mm, you've met?<eos> No, but I've seen her picture on your desk.<eos> You don't bring her along when you travel?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - Oh, why's that?<eos> Surely she would like a trip to New York, wouldn't she?<eos> Yes, but we do have three children at home.<eos> Oh. Do you have pictures?<eos> I don't, no.
Actually, we could've been friends, you and I.<eos> Can't we still?<eos> I think it's a little awkward, don't you, seeing as how my husband's in love with you?<eos> Don't insult me by acting surprised.<eos> Danny told me.<eos> He-- he told you...<eos> He always tells me.<eos> We've been through this before.<eos> Did you think you were different?<eos> They all do.
No, it's fine.<eos> I'm gonna win it all back.<eos> I've got this.<eos> So four of a kind.<eos> So what's a full house?<eos> The death penalty is undeniably popular.<eos> 32 out of 50 states have it.<eos> 62% of Americans want it.<eos> - Do you know who James Surowiecki is?<eos> - I do.
When I'm around, no one disappoints him more than me.<eos> I'm a bartender and a club fighter.<eos> I've never measured up.<eos> I think you're wrong.<eos> I think he is proud of you.<eos> You just can't see it.<eos> He's so excited about watching you fight.<eos> But I'm gonna lose.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Me, too.<eos> But sometimes I just... I feel so confused.<eos> You know, not... not about us, but about everything.<eos> My life.<eos> I'm going to be 28 soon.<eos> 28.<eos> Martin, I want you to know that I don't want to put any restrictions on you.<eos> You're young and need to feel free.<eos> I know. I mean, I don't have a Teddy, but I have other special friends.<eos> You do?
What?<eos> - Go back, go back, go back.<eos> - We gotta go back?<eos> - Yes, go back.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> Hello, Officer.<eos> Just having a little seat belt problem.<eos> You didn't see that red light, sir?<eos> Yes, I did.
Thank you.<eos> I'm not good at being assertive.<eos> I have odd self-esteem.<eos> But it's very important that I stress we need to get our message out there to the people.<eos> Mankind is imbalanced and needs to change.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Walter has a manservant.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he does.
So the Dark One's returned.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's only one person who can help us drive him back out.<eos> H-h-he's here?<eos> Th-that's... That's impossible.<eos> Well, did you really think he'd stay away?<eos> The dagger... you need to hand it over so we can stop this fight before it starts.<eos> The dagger?<eos> I-I don't have the dagger.<eos> Killian does.
So the Dark One's returned.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's only one person who can help us drive him back out.<eos> H-h-he's here?<eos> Th-that's... that's impossible.<eos> Well, did you really think he'd stay away?<eos> The dagger... you need to hand it over so we can stop this fight before it starts.<eos> The dagger?<eos> I-I don't have the dagger.<eos> Killian does.
Rumplestiltskin.<eos> He resurrected you.<eos> To help himself, not me.<eos> Cruella's death only confirmed that.<eos> Oh. Now you want to turn on him before he turns on you.<eos> I knew Gold couldn't keep the dragon on her leash for long.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Nothing from you.<eos> But your daughter, I hear, has a talent for finding people.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Right?<eos> What happened to our dreams?<eos> You were gonna be the next Julia Child with your own restaurant and cookbook and TV show.<eos> You were gonna have an empire.<eos> Yeah, I don't have that.<eos> And I don't have a corner office on Wall Street with a hot assistant who's secretly in love with me.<eos> - This is a wake-up call.<eos> - Yes it is.<eos> - We got to start networking.<eos> - Yes we do.
They only serve me wine in this palace.<eos> They think this is beneath me.<eos> A good beer is beneath no one.<eos> My lord.<eos> Lagus.<eos> It seems an age ago, that night in the alley When you came to my aid.<eos> Thank you for being a trusted friend.<eos> A loyal servant.<eos> What i did not know that night Is that you did not need my aid.<eos> Yes, i did, as i do now.
Wait.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Braxton is trying to extract a memory from Agent Keen.<eos> He will do so by any means necessary.<eos> He's likely contacted someone for that purpose already.<eos> Find out who that someone is.<eos> What memory?<eos> A memory she has no memory of.<eos> You said you had the situation under control.<eos> - I do.
It's gonna be fine.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> Something happened that night, something people are willing to kill to find out, and whatever it was involved my father.<eos> I'm not doing this for Braxton or for you.<eos> I'm doing it for me.<eos> I need to know the truth.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I'll have it to you by 9:00.<eos> I thought you said you had it already.<eos> And I do.
As you can see, he eventually succeeded.<eos> As to what happened to these two, I'm still working that out.<eos> But I'd hazard a guess that it was not what they intended.<eos> Now, are there any stupid questions?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, you showed me some things.<eos> I wanna bust Royalle as much as you.<eos> But Wolfe is evil.<eos> - Do you believe in evil?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Get out.<eos> - Calista, please...<eos> - Get out.<eos> - You just...<eos> - I said get out. Just leave!<eos> You are so sucked into their bullshit.<eos> And you don't even see it!<eos> It's like you think you've gotta be a Power to even matter in this world.<eos> You don't know anything!<eos> You don't anything about me!
Thank you.<eos> - Finally.<eos> - Calista.<eos> If you try and touch her, Johnny...<eos> You, too, Christian.<eos> And I'm not half-demented or bullet-ridden this time.<eos> We're not going to try anything.<eos> Just let her leave.<eos> I don't think she wants to leave.<eos> Do you?
She'd get into moods of depression about the whole business, the personal relationship, cursing and smashing things, and this worsened as the time went by.<eos> ♪ Gonna see my sweet honey baby ♪<eos> ♪ Gonna break this chain off and run ♪ ♪ I'm gonna lay down somewhere shady ♪<eos> All I did was work, work, work.<eos> I was always tired.<eos> I was always tired.<eos> I could never sleep.<eos> You see, music always goes through my head, which means the more I played, the less I could relax.<eos> I kept thinking Andy would let me rest.<eos> He never did.
♪ I don't know, I don't know ♪<eos> As the civil rights movement really swung into high gear, she swung into high gear with it.<eos> In '65, we played at the Selma March in Montgomery, Alabama.<eos> We have a legal and constitutional right to march from Selma to Montgomery!<eos> It was extremely dangerous.<eos> The federal Marshals were called in, and they were standing on the tops of all the buildings downtown with guns.<eos> Seated in front of the stage facing the audience was Martin Luther King,<eos> Ralph Bunche from the UN and a lot of other worldwide dignitaries.<eos> You had Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Sidney Poitier,<eos> Bill Cosby, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Belafonte, and we did "Mississippi Goddam."
I think you'll find today's most intriguing story on page 20, bottom-left corner.<eos> "According to Uzbek authorities, Father Aleksandr Nabiyev, a local priest in the Tashkent Region of Uzbekistan"...<eos> You're intrigued because a priest was kidnapped?<eos> No.<eos> I'm intrigued because the priest is not a priest.<eos> From what I hear, the good Father Nabiyev is an agent of the CIA.<eos> That's a crime, Agent Keen.<eos> Going back to the Cold War, the CIA has a long and controversial history of using religious figures as spies in violation of executive orders, internal CIA policy, and promises made by every president since Ford.<eos> And you know who kidnapped this agent?<eos> I do.
It's a good story.<eos> But that's all it is... a story from a crazy old man.<eos> Who happened to keep a complete set of the original documents in the hope that, one day, he might find the courage to set things right.<eos> You engineers did better the second time around.<eos> At least this one took 20 years to start leaking.<eos> If this is true and Anneca is responsible for hundreds of people's deaths, then you and the other high-level executives will be prosecuted.<eos> Reparations can be paid to the alleged victims.<eos> We can fix this.<eos> Reparations are all well and good, but the people I represent don't want you to fix it.<eos> They don't?
Gillian's lovely, by the way.<eos> Oh! Well.<eos> So funny.<eos> So sweet.<eos> So uncomplicated.<eos> Her heart's in the right place.<eos> So, what was he upset for?<eos> I thought he never wanted it.<eos> Well, no.<eos> He didn't.
She was a secretary.<eos> And she reminded me of Celia.<eos> The second I saw her, everything about her, the way her eyes lit up when she smiled.<eos> Way she walked.<eos> I felt that same feeling I felt when I was with Celia.<eos> It was...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Like... the world lit up.<eos> And we were weak, we were daft, we were old enough to know better, it shouldn't have happened.<eos> But it did.
We've, I've...<eos> There's a problem with your mum.<eos> Mum, you need to get dressed.<eos> He's no better than your father.<eos> ~ Mum, I want you to get dressed.<eos> ~ Did you hear what I said?<eos> However, today isn't about that. ~ Look... .. please don't take this the wrong way,<eos> ~ but you don't mind if I don't come, do you?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> Yes, I do, actually.
I'm your son and that is what I'm supposed to do.<eos> And I'm happy to be here because I love you.<eos> But I need a break.<eos> That's all you do, James, is take breaks.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have been there.<eos> And you have been amazing at times, but you have got to get your act together.<eos> And if you don't want to talk about Dad, make sure you write it down.<eos> It's not about Dad, I don't give a shit.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You have been there.<eos> And you have been amazing at times, but you have got to get your act together.<eos> And if you don't want to talk about Dad, make sure you write it down.<eos> It's not about Dad, I don't give a shit.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> You know what, dude, shut up.<eos> You don't know.<eos> Don't tell me to shut up.<eos> Don't tell him to shut up.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, then if I Can't keep her here then what am I supposed to do?<eos> Mom?<eos> We have to go home.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Hello, James.<eos> Mom, do you remember what year it is'?<eos> It's 2013.<eos> Thank God. You really scared me.<eos> You remember?<eos> No, I don't.
I need help.<eos> Well, I'm here now.<eos> You want to go home? No.<eos> Let's go out.<eos> Let's go to your friends.<eos> Let's go to your friends.<eos> Well, you have your interview tomorrow.<eos> You don't want me to meet your friends?<eos> I thought you wanted me to meet your friends.<eos> Of course I do.
Mona's body could seriously be in that barrel.<eos> Do you want to burn that, too?<eos> No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> But we can put it somewhere.<eos> If we touch anything, that's tampering with the evidence.<eos> Evidence that could convict Ali.<eos> And me.<eos> And I don't have a good alibi.<eos> Yes, you do.
And I realized that after I did it.<eos> I mean, I tried to get the letter back from Jackie, but she'd already read it.<eos> It was too late.<eos> I...<eos> Aria, stop.<eos> I'm not angry.<eos> You're not?<eos> It's a brilliant move.<eos> Jackie must have lapped it up.<eos> Oh, yeah, she definitely did.
So technically, they're mine.<eos> Until someone buys them.<eos> I have a list of questions here from last year's pageant.<eos> How would you reverse the extinction of today's endangered species?<eos> What is your opinion of our country's current foreign policy?<eos> Hanna, these pageants aren't just about being pretty anymore.<eos> Pretty isn't the point.<eos> Judges don't give out crowns to living lollipops.<eos> You need to have an opinion about the world we live in.<eos> I do.
Why won't you tell me what you were doing at that storage unit?<eos> Because once you know, you can't un-know.<eos> This isn't a debate.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> You need to tell me now.<eos> Hanna!<eos> Okay, I... I went there to move everything out of the unit.<eos> I thought Mona's bloody clothes would be there, maybe her body.<eos> I thought you just said you had nothing to do with her death.<eos> I didn't.
This country does have its perks.<eos> To Hamlet.<eos> To revenge.<eos> What'd you think? I thought that the sets were really impressive.<eos> The sets. Mm-hmm.<eos> Right.<eos> So critical to any stellar Shakespearean production.<eos> The lighting was really good. Another aspect typically overlooked by most audiences.<eos> You didn't like it.<eos> No, I didn't.
Sustained.<eos> Move on, Mr. Sirk.<eos> Last chance, Mr. DiLaurentis.<eos> Do you want to clear this up, or leave it to the jury's imagination?<eos> Objection.<eos> Improper, inflammatory, irrelevant.<eos> Sustained. Do you have any other questions for this witness?<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Do you think Hanna knew about this?<eos> She did.
Um, Aria?<eos> I hear you, okay?<eos> Hi. Can I see your form?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Showing up now seems a little convenient, doesn't it?<eos> This chick gets a letter from a pal claiming a death threat, and she never mentions it to the cops for months.<eos> Can we not talk about that?<eos> She's making you and your friends look like a coven of witches.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you?
It's been a long day, ladies.<eos> But if Kendra doesn't know what you'll be asking her on the stand...<eos> I'm not putting Kendra on the stand.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> - Why?<eos> No jury is going to be swayed by a witness who earlier in the day saw eight fingers on one hand, and was picking up NPR through her cavity fillings.<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> - We don't have anybody else.<eos> Yes, we do.
You can't be ready for how it feels, Em.<eos> It's hard not to give up on hope.<eos> You guys, they can take everything from us, but they can't take us from each other.<eos> I don't care how far apart from you guys I am, I will still be with you.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Same here.<eos> I love you, guys.<eos> Love you. Ah! Ow!<eos> We just had an accident.<eos> Yeah, I did in my pants.
I'll take one of those, too.<eos> Well, she is Herman's fellow.<eos> Isn't she sort of supposed to follow Herman around?<eos> They're laughing all the time,<eos> And Arizona seems so...<eos> Happy... like really happy.<eos> - So?<eos> - You seem happy... Ish.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I don't, obviously.
- then pull the plug.<eos> - This is...<eos> We don't need to be talking about this.<eos> If I do wake up but I'm dependent on vents or tubes, pull the plug then, too.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're not... you're not dying.<eos> You're not gonna wake up gorked.<eos> Shepherd knows<eos> - what she's doing.<eos> She does.

Yes, my order.<eos> Your best friend is in danger, Show me that you care.<eos> Get creates.<eos> The airplanes!<eos> All planes moving again.<eos> It's just a basic temporary shutdown.<eos> A cheap trick.<eos> I could not have do anything with them anyway.<eos> What does it say?<eos> What does what?
You don't want to what, Mr. Palmer?<eos> I don't want to know how much her liver weighs.<eos> I don't want to catalog her scars.<eos> But most of all, I don't want to cut open another friend.<eos> I think I've had my limit.<eos> I don't remember the moment when I reached my limit, but I do remember never being the same.<eos> Would you like to see her?<eos> You never loved me.<eos> I liked you.<eos> I still do.
You can't understand that emptiness.<eos> Mom, I need to know.<eos> Wait.<eos> Thomas!<eos> I'm sorry about before.<eos> It's not my business.<eos> It's all good.<eos> I'm not that fat.<eos> It's OK if Marie says it.<eos> But when I do...
Shit! This place reminds me of a dream I had when I was really little.<eos> It was like the end of civilization.<eos> No one left.<eos> And suddenly, all my old toys appeared.<eos> The ones my Mom threw out when I was little.<eos> But it was nice.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Is this me?<eos> It doesn't look anything like me.<eos> Yes, it does.
No.<eos> Do you want to do something with me?<eos> Are you high?<eos> I'm not yet.<eos> On you go, then.<eos> Another one?<eos> Why do you wanna kill yourself now?<eos> I feel bad, I told you.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You don't?
Now the question is how to destroy them?<eos> Their population isn't going to extinct, it will even increase.<eos> They currently don't have time to age, eternal life forever.<eos> Why is that?<eos> That's because the virus will never stop developing.<eos> And they are resistant to all weather and temperature changes.<eos> They don't need food or water to live.<eos> So much has changed.<eos> Once quiet and comfortable life inside the Wall I want it back.<eos> We all do.
Wait, you didn't kill Karl?<eos> It wasn't Laverne.<eos> If it wasn't Laverne, then who killed Karl?<eos> Uh... I hate to agree with our friend Alex, but...<eos> Croatoan is inside the perimeter.<eos> Parker?<eos> Parker.<eos> Tell Laverne to let you out of there right now.<eos> Laverne, did you see who killed Karl?<eos> Okay, you didn't.
Roger would fire me if I did anything wrong.<eos> Anybody else at the bakery know what Connor was into?<eos> We all suspected, except Roger.<eos> That dude invented rose-colored glasses.<eos> And, uh, what else did you suspect Connor was into?<eos> I answer, you could charge me with accessory.<eos> Yeah, and if you don't, I charge you with impeding an investigation.<eos> I told him not to do it.<eos> I told him I didn't want no part of it.<eos> None of us did.
Spivak recorded his plans in great detail using microdot technology, a quaint encryption trick of the mid-20th century.<eos> They just made everything really tiny and hoped nobody would find it.<eos> It's all there in its original German.<eos> From its repeated references to "Die Welt wird frei von Upirs sein."<eos> Um, "making the world upir-free," and, "Das Pathogen zeigt keine Wirkung "an denen ihm ausgesetzen Menschen."<eos> "The pathogen doesn't affect human beings exposed to it."<eos> It's abundantly clear that Spivak's development of the LoPS pathogen was and is the primary catalyst for the extermination of all upir.<eos> - Does Roman have it?<eos> - Not to my knowledge, no.<eos> Of course he doesn't.
Come on it!<eos> This is bad.<eos> He is mobilizing his army.<eos> We have to assume he has the fragment, and he is preparing an attack.<eos> He probably has stockpiles like this set up all over this city.<eos> We have to give up searching for Red.<eos> Times up.<eos> If Rumpelstiltskin has the mirror, why has not he attacked yet?<eos> Because he has not it.<eos> Red does it.
What if it only work one way.<eos> If we leave now and we cannot get back... this all have been for nothing.<eos> My father has a whole army back home.<eos> Maybe if we open the Portal, he can send them through.<eos> If he has an army, why does not he use it?<eos> Because he is employing strategy, unlike some.<eos> If we attack him with an army it might trigger his invasion.<eos> It is probably best to destroy the fragment.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - If only you do.
- What about after that?<eos> She was dying.<eos> If Peter saw her like that, it wouldn't have mattered if it was an accident or not.<eos> He would have come after me, until one of us was dead.<eos> And he wouldn't have stopped with just me.<eos> You were there, too.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> You have to understand that.<eos> I understand, Roman.<eos> I do.
That's bullcrap.<eos> Somebody do something.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Here comes the cavalry.<eos> Whoa, that was awesome.<eos> These women are warriors.<eos> They live by the code of the ancient Amazon.<eos> A sisterhood that had each other's backs.<eos> Wow, I wish I had that.<eos> You do!
But, erm, the other stuff?<eos> Why?<eos> Isn't that what you do when you meet someone?<eos> I tell you stuff.<eos> You tell me stuff.<eos> This is us.<eos> So grown-up.<eos> You drink tea out of a thermos, and you go for... country walks.<eos> I must seem young... compared to the people you work with.<eos> You do.
It's never tidier than this.<eos> Had you guessed?<eos> Mmm, I'd guessed you hadn't slept with guys before.<eos> I'd thought maybe you'd slept with a couple of women.<eos> Can I ask you a question? Mmm. What's stopped you?<eos> You don't have to answer.<eos> How do you admit to someone you've never been in a relationship?<eos> Who wants to hear?<eos> And when they do, who wants to stay?<eos> I do.
Yeah, I guess.<eos> You don't just stop loving someone.<eos> How do you feel about nicole and dave getting married?<eos> I didn't know about the engagement until you told me.<eos> I'm happy for her if that's what she wants.<eos> So you're not the least bit jealous?<eos> I'm not the jealous type.<eos> That's not what she told us.<eos> She said that you were possessive and controlling.<eos> She did?
If you want victory, do you know what the best thing to do is?<eos> Try. Like, your hardest.<eos> Okay. I mean, I was trying very hard.<eos> The worse that things get, the more amazing it will be when we turn this around.<eos> We can totally turn this around.<eos> That's a very peppy perspective.<eos> I'm a peppy person.<eos> I think maybe cheer brain has kicked in already.<eos> I'm fairly certain you've got spirit.<eos> Yes. I do.
You should've gone to support Caroline, at least.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I did go, in fact.<eos> I said to Celia, "I'm going whether you do or not."<eos> And then when I got there she told me there was no point me being there if her mother wasn't.<eos> So.<eos> ~ She said that?<eos> ~ Did she?<eos> ~ Caroline did?
~ Why?<eos> Because... yesterday morning, before you turned up... .. he asked me to marry him.<eos> And then, God knows how many hours later, I'm in bed with you.<eos> Because I'm stupid and flaky and I'm fed up of being those things!<eos> ~ You don't want to marry him.<eos> ~ Don't I?<eos> I asked you to marry me.<eos> More or less.<eos> Well, what if I did want to marry him?<eos> ~ What if I do?

But between you and me, she's not actually speaking to me at the moment.<eos> Oh, no. Why?<eos> I didn't go to the wedding.<eos> ~ Why not?<eos> ~ I don't think she's speaking to me either.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Eh, lady.<eos> You and me need to have a conversation about school.<eos> Yeah, we don't.
It's lovely having you all here. With all of us.<eos> Oh, you're welcome, Liam.<eos> But, have you put any thought into long-term living arrangements?<eos> Well, obviously, I've already asked Father Linehan, but he seems a bit reluctant after the whole "Godfather" debacle.<eos> And now the godparents will take their vows.<eos> Do you renounce Satan?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I suppose.<eos> Do you believe in God the Father, creator of Heaven and Earth?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Stop it.<eos> I know I've made mistakes, but I don't have time to beg anyone's forgiveness until we find Grace first.<eos> Tetra promised...<eos> She promised me last night she'd protect my baby.<eos> That book, like the ones Dad used on Sangolo.<eos> This was a ritual... a blood sacrifice.<eos> - Maybe Tetra was trying to help.<eos> - Come on, Mar.<eos> You don't believe anything good could come from something that evil, do you?<eos> But I do now.
Listen, don't beat yourself up over this, all right, Larry?<eos> They always kick this form back.<eos> It's the 21-526ez.<eos> It's the hamburger hill of disability claim forms.<eos> Mr. Alzate?<eos> Yeah, just one s... Well, look who it is.<eos> I was wondering if I could maybe interview you again.<eos> Me?<eos> I thought you wanted your report to be about a hero.<eos> Yes, I-I do.
That's how I want to go out.<eos> Epic.<eos> I need Cookie.<eos> You got to find me Cookie.<eos> Whoa.<eos> This is really beautiful.<eos> Whose place is this?<eos> This is my buddy's from Iraq.<eos> I told him I was bringing a very special lady here this weekend.<eos> You did, did you?
Win some, lose some.<eos> Elizabeth looks at you very differently now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know how hard this is for you, with Paige.<eos> It's hard for The Centre, too.<eos> They're learning from their mistakes.<eos> Jared murdered his family.<eos> Well, that's hardly a risk here.<eos> I just want Paige to make her own decisions.<eos> We all do.
Lando Cal--?<eos> Por qué no te callas?<eos> Will you shut up?<eos> I need to think!<eos> Don't yell at me, I didn't lose her.<eos> Now just try to retrace your steps.<eos> Well, I wasn't in the sofa cushions.<eos> Agh!<eos> Well, you could have said that!<eos> I did.
And the rest of you, I can't see any benefit in telling Lana what happened here today.<eos> Understood?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Aw! I'm not saying nothing.<eos> I'm on board for that.<eos> And Krieger...<eos> I swear to God, if I catch you near this child again,<eos> But-- and the implied threat here is that I will shoot you in the genitals, and then sit here sipping amontillado sherry while you bleed to death.<eos> Wait, you already knew the code?<eos> Of course he did.
you remembered about the target?<eos> The target was from a country that in World War Two, was an Axis power.<eos> [Sighs] Ray forgot the gum.<eos> So... how'd you get the name Crash?<eos> Oh, it's a long story... about me saving the lives of eight other climbers right after an avalanche. Sploosh. Sploosh.<eos> Is I bet the sound an avalanche makes. Uh, no, it's more like a freight train full of tornadoes, which are in turn full of smaller freight trains.<eos> Which are in turn full of shit. Sorry?<eos> She just had a baby.<eos> Ya know...<eos> I didn't.
If... if anyone can handle it, we can.<eos> I'm not saying we can't handle it.<eos> I'm asking if we should.<eos> Yeah, we're doctors.<eos> Maybe we are better equipped to make an educated decision here.<eos> And maybe we were given this baby for a reason.<eos> April.<eos> You called your mom.<eos> Yeah. People need their mom in a crisis.<eos> No, not everybody does.
I like the sound.<eos> It's kinda soothing.<eos> It feels weird to sleep alone.<eos> I'm not used to it.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> He used to go away all the time, but this time, he's...<eos> He's gone, and I know he's gone.<eos> And the bed feels lonely.<eos> It's like I don't know how to sleep alone.<eos> You don't.
Where's Pierce?<eos> What is she... morning shift? I get nights?<eos> I went to a hotel.<eos> What?<eos> With who?<eos> Do I know him?<eos> No.<eos> By myself.<eos> You didn't want to see Derek?<eos> I did.
- No.<eos> - No.<eos> That's hurtful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry, Mitchell.<eos> You were scared, and I should've held your hand through the tunnel, and I was...<eos> I was not a good big sister.<eos> I'm so sorry. Will you forgive me?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> - You do?
Do you remember Paris?<eos> I remember climbing the Eiffel Tower and running down the Champs-Élysées.<eos> - It was raining, but...<eos> - There was a nice old lady.<eos> - And she gave me her umbrella.<eos> - It had a hole in it.<eos> I was soaked.<eos> So you have all the same memories?<eos> Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.<eos> - They all do.
And you're wondering if you should be here...<eos> - or with Ethan.<eos> - You see?<eos> See, you are in my head.<eos> You know my thoughts and my feelings, and that's what I don't want.<eos> You can control what's happening to you, Molly.<eos> The headaches, the urges.<eos> You see that they've already started to recede.<eos> I don't know what I am.<eos> Yes, you do.

What'd you find out, Ahdu?<eos> Casualties.<eos> Women, children.<eos> Some got away.<eos> - Some didn't.<eos> - Did they find Terra?<eos> Or Ares.<eos> But I know they're out there somewhere.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
- I lost a lot of men.<eos> And walked away from the fight.<eos> It didn't seem like my fight anymore.<eos> Something you learn when you're the one giving the orders: sometimes there are no good decisions.<eos> It's just a lesser of two evils.<eos> And from my seat, that's the best that you can do.<eos> Evil is still evil, General.<eos> Even when it's lesser.<eos> She thinks I killed her husband.<eos> Molly does.
How could you?<eos> Wait!<eos> We do it and we do it now.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you saying, Julie?<eos> I'm saying I don't care what happens,<eos> I'm not making the wrong decision again.<eos> Shut the program down, Charlie.<eos> You realize we could go to jail for this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
So it broke. So what?<eos> You said Laura had trouble sleeping, the night of the murder.<eos> Well, it's hardly surprising.<eos> How was she when you got back to the house after you'd left the BB?<eos> Scared witless.<eos> Jumping at shadows.<eos> I think I know what Mr. Smythe was burning.<eos> Try to stay calm.<eos> Father Brown always has a plan.<eos> You do, don't you?
It barely hurts.<eos> What are you doing here? !<eos> I wanted to see you.<eos> I understand you don't love me, but at least let me do this for you.<eos> He gave me the knife and went back to the BB.<eos> Where he removed the dressing, no doubt realising his wound was far more serious than he thought, burned the evidence, then cried bloody murder.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> That doesn't explain why you agreed to marry him.<eos> Yes, it does.
What about it?<eos> Have you reviewed the preliminary reports?<eos> The explosion appears to have been generated from an outside source.<eos> Perhaps the hybrids launched another assault.<eos> But why would the hybrids kill Toby if he was helping them?<eos> If there's another player on the board, I need to know.<eos> Of course, but this brings up the question of your own safety,<eos> Madame Secretary.<eos> I have adequate security.<eos> As did General Shepherd.
Something's wrong.<eos> Molly, they're coming.<eos> The hybrids are down.<eos> How many?<eos> All of 'em.<eos> Which way, Molly?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This room was supposed to only have one doorway, not three.<eos> I thought you said you had this place memorized.<eos> I did.
Even you.<eos> This isn't possible.<eos> Newer model.<eos> We evolve too, Molly.<eos> And this is only the beginning.<eos> - You don't... have to do this.<eos> - I have orders.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't know what I am.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, if I see Frank in Ohio, I'll be sure to send along your regards.<eos> What did he mean?<eos> What's a ménage à trois?<eos> I'm not trying to impress anyone.<eos> I was in a bind.<eos> Now I'm not.<eos> I think Frank helped me out and he's paying the price.<eos> And Oppenheimer won't tell you where he is?<eos> We're not even sure he knows.<eos> Well, somebody does.
You want two more to grow up without their father?<eos> You think I don't know about Europe?<eos> Honestly?<eos> You remember that first doctor at Mass General?<eos> The one who looked like Calvin Coolidge?<eos> A medical improbability.<eos> That's what he called it.<eos> And I told you we could raise Siamese cats for all I care.<eos> But you wanted a daughter so badly.<eos> We both did.
Are you sure?<eos> Are you certain you want to give everything?<eos> Well, that's the deal.<eos> And if what they say is true, that the kingdom of God is coming...<eos> Yes, if...<eos> If it's true.<eos> But if it's true, don't you want to be part of it and away from all the corruption and misery out there?<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I want to believe.<eos> I truly do.
I mean, have there been other guys like me?<eos> You know, I mean, have you picked some fish guy to talk to the fish people on fish planet or something like that?<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'm...<eos> I feel fine. Tired.<eos> I'm really tired.<eos> Pretty much been... been harvesting nonstop, you know, and Ellie and I are still trying to get pregnant.<eos> That's not going so well, plus the Rams have had a terrible start to their season, so this whole utopia thing's a bit of a debatable point in our house right now.<eos> You obviously didn't come here to talk about football.<eos> No, I didn't.
Come on, let's go upstairs.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Detective Boden.<eos> - Hey, honey.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - How are you doing? - What's going on?<eos> Hey, look at the little chief.<eos> He's even got the old man's furrowed brow.<eos> Yeah, he does.
So, what do you guys think?<eos> What is it? It's my dad's old footlocker from the Navy.<eos> Sylvie mentioned you guys needed a coffee table,<eos> I thought this would be perfect. It's great.<eos> Right?<eos> Anyone? Ah, yes, please.<eos> Hermann wore me out.<eos> Oh, he will do that to you.<eos> I don't think I have any, actually.<eos> - Oh, yes you do.
That I got kicked off the board like an old piece of rust?<eos> Eh. You don't want to know about me anyway.<eos> You've got your own fancy life.<eos> Hey.<eos> Everything I have, I worked for. And you know why?<eos> Because you taught me that.<eos> I saw you get up early in the morning to go to the shop.<eos> I saw you come home late from the union meetings.<eos> It made an impression.<eos> It still does.
Bit of a blow losing your star player.<eos> I'm sure our new captain will make up the deficit.<eos> May the best side win.<eos> I'm surprised you're all being so casual about your tenth defeat in a row.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Know what?<eos> I suggest you take a look at the original articles of 1783.<eos> Should either side be victor for ten successive years, they claim ownership of the land in perpetuity.<eos> ~ Did you know about this?<eos> ~ No, I didn't.
The patient.<eos> It's a long story, please, just go.<eos> Is he gonna be okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's scared, you know, but he's got a fighting chance, but it's a pretty risky operation.<eos> But at least it's a chance.<eos> And, in success, he'll be able to undo whatever it is they did to him.<eos> I'd envy that.<eos> I don't know- - I guess I got to learn how to live with it, huh?<eos> We both do.
I want to put 'em both in my mouth and then make a slapping sound on my bald head with 'em.<eos> We have a tranq gun if he gets rough. ♪ Highway run ♪ ♪ Into the midnight sun... ♪<eos> Meg, why are you home so early?<eos> Yeah, I thought you were doing your modeling thing.<eos> I was.<eos> But what... what's happening here?<eos> Well, not that it's any of your business, Meg, but this is why we've been married as long as we have.<eos> We do things together.<eos> You think 20 years just happens?<eos> No, it does not.
Just relax.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Open up your mind.<eos> We're gonna live in her memories.<eos> We can do that?<eos> Just take her hand.<eos> I want to stop.<eos> If you stop, you'll never learn, sweetie.<eos> I don't want to learn.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well...<eos> I was wondering how long it would take before Mama barked for her lapdog.<eos> Baby Sis got hitched to a yankee.<eos> You think I'm gonna miss that clambake?<eos> Now, Lou, I had no idea what Mama was doing to your pills.<eos> I swear.<eos> I'm only here to broker peace.<eos> Well, peace requires a compromise, which is something our dear mother is utterly incapable of.<eos> Be that as it may, she does have your best interests at heart.<eos> Does she, now?
Maybe we should just kiss, and everything will suddenly be better.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - What?<eos> I think I should get you home.<eos> Maybe we're what we both need.<eos> And we just didn't know it.<eos> We should be pirates, not farmers or watchers or judges.<eos> Connie.<eos> You don't even know who I am.<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, you already figured out the hardest thing.<eos> I have?<eos> It's not for the artist to understand what he's made.<eos> It's up to a viewer to figure it out.<eos> Your job is just to make the pictures. Wow. Huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, Richie.<eos> Hi.<eos> You got pictures from the barbecue?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm sorry about the party.<eos> Let it go.<eos> I don't want to talk about the party.<eos> You're my best friend.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I'm your best friend?<eos> That's interesting, because best friends don't sell each other out.<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> You told Rosie that I have pictures of the slap.<eos> But you do.
The last thing New York needs, other than more filthy rich Europeans.<eos> Oh, by the way, I think we should cancel our cable and just use the guy next door, the racist.<eos> It's, like, 3 grand a year, though.<eos> You going to sleep?<eos> Uh, maybe, yeah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Because I was thinking you need a suit for the trial.<eos> Could go buy one in the morning.<eos> I have a suit.<eos> (Rosie) No, you don't.

I think there's no reason to paint.<eos> But we know this, right?<eos> It doesn't put food on the table.<eos> It doesn't make you or the people around you happy.<eos> It's just this vestige from a primordial time when we scratched messages onto walls, hoping that someone would see us.<eos> And yet, we do.<eos> And it's good.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Gary Weschler thinks I'm good?<eos> Yes, he does.
But I hate her.<eos> She's just not a cool person.<eos> So just try to have a good time tonight, okay?<eos> Live it up.<eos> Maybe they're right about livin' it up.<eos> I mean, of course I wish I was pregnant, but I'm not.<eos> Let's have one of our legendary nights.<eos> Remember when we stole your dad's pickup and we drove to Vegas, but we just stayed in the car 'cause we were too young to do anything?<eos> We saw stuff out the window, though.<eos> Yeah, we did.
And me?<eos> You'll have your wish.<eos> You'll sit beside me on the Court.<eos> My partner.<eos> My love.<eos> But I'm not one of you.<eos> I'm just a nobody from the streets.<eos> My father recruited you, trained you.<eos> I've known you since we were children, and I know there's greatness in you.<eos> Maybe you do, but the rest of them...
Have you told Charles?<eos> Or will you continue leading him on?<eos> I'm not leading him on.<eos> Charles is one of my dearest friends.<eos> You have lots of friends in Hamilton, yet you choose to spend most of your time with him.<eos> I think you need to ask yourself why.<eos> Mr. Avery.<eos> I never got to thank you for all you did to find Clara.<eos> You don't need to.<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, I'll tell you what.<eos> My daughter will testify.<eos> So will my fiancée.<eos> Am I making this up... hmm?<eos> No one saw this.<eos> Are you counting on my son?<eos> 'Cause there's something you should know.<eos> He's never had the nerve to go up against his father.<eos> All right?<eos> He still doesn't.
You okay?<eos> I shouldn't have come.<eos> He used me to play the jury.<eos> You and me both.<eos> He flat-out lied on the stand.<eos> I knew he would.<eos> I've known guys like this my whole life.<eos> I went straight at him, he slipped every punch.<eos> I don't know what happened up there.<eos> Oh, I do.
And we might be working late.<eos> Wetestedtheequipment that you use to fix the flooring in the building, and your mallet caused the victim's injuries and tested positive for her blood.<eos> So your move next.<eos> No. You guys got it all wrong.<eos> I didn't kill Justine.<eos> Right. So somebody stole your mallet, then killed Justine with it, and then what?<eos> Planted it back on you?<eos> Okay, I shouldn't have lied.<eos> But I was scared that you would think that I killed Justine.<eos> We do.
Saturday.<eos> Day after tomorrow.<eos> Screw it, I'll go.<eos> [gasps] Really?<eos> Really, really, really?<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> Oh, man. Wait till they see--<eos> Wait, that's how you ask a woman out?<eos> Yes. Wait, no, I don't need a back-story.<eos> Yes you do.
I'm guessing you're not here on a basketball scholarship.<eos> That's not a regulation trashcan. Hey.<eos> I saw your camera.<eos> I'm thinking about buying one.<eos> You like it?<eos> It gets the job done.<eos> What kind of photography are you into?<eos> A little bit of everything. Well, it has good color reproduction, nice tonal range.<eos> Um, you'll want to shoot raw if you don't want the highlights to get clipped, and...<eos> No. No, I don't.
Body!<eos> - Travis Webber?<eos> - Yeah, looks like.<eos> - Spoke to our victim's wife?<eos> - Yeah, Shauna Webber.<eos> She's in there right now.<eos> Says her husband's a saint.<eos> How he can't change a light bulb.<eos> She doesn't think he was our mastermind.<eos> No, she does not.
Bishop Talbot won't be coming to deliver the Corpus Christi homily tomorrow after all.<eos> Would you believe it?<eos> He's off shooting birds.<eos> Shooting?<eos> !<eos> Bentley Duke has invited me to go shooting on his estate.<eos> Bentley Duke?<eos> What, the theatrical impresario?<eos> But, My Lord, you loathe the theatre.<eos> Yeah, well, I do.
~ I've got some catching up to do.<eos> ~ I wasn't aware it was a competition.<eos> Closer.<eos> Oh, dear...<eos> So, Bishop Talbot, do you think adulterers should be treated like murderers?<eos> I think marriage is sacred, Mr Redhill.<eos> ~ Well, that is not quite the same thing.<eos> ~ Peter...<eos> You said in The Times, and I quote, that "we should treat the ending of a marriage as seriously as the death of a person."<eos> I did indeed.
The burnt girl, horrible.<eos> Jenna was just with you this afternoon, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> How was her condition when she left your office?<eos> Did you have to administer gas or any meds?<eos> She needed a filling in her lower second molar, so there was some Lidocaine and there was some nitrous, but they wear off rather quickly.<eos> She was fine by the time she left.<eos> I understand you have a suspect in custody.<eos> We do, yes.
(Danny) Hey, thanks for coming.<eos> Have a seat, man.<eos> [sighing] Look, Jeremy, um<eos> I'm not gonna be at the practice anymore, because, well, I'm not gonna be here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Morgan was right.<eos> What?<eos> Don't say anything else.<eos> Danny, I know.<eos> - You do?
No.<eos> Oh, my God, you straight up love this dude.<eos> I thought you were in this for the dollar, dollar bill, y'all, but really, you just like the feeling of someone believing in you.<eos> Yeah, why wouldn't I?<eos> Everyone else thinks I'm a screw-up.<eos> I can't pay bills, and did you know that I keep my side-view mirrors attached with straight up derkt tape?<eos> Rishi, I don't think you're a screw-up.<eos> Look, I'm sorry that I'm so hard on you.<eos> And, yeah, I know that Greg is handsome and cool and that photo implies that he owns a boat.<eos> I do.
Or the supposed friend, caught with the murder weapon.<eos> Or the long-lost daughter, who had just been rejected?<eos> Or the runaway thief?<eos> You see, we had motives.<eos> Yeah, but none of that helped... with the central problem.<eos> Until I considered another riddle.<eos> And then it all started to make sense.<eos> If the killer had no way out of the workshop, then they had to still be there!<eos> But we'd have seen him.<eos> Oh, but you did.
Why are you crying?<eos> A few friends called me after they saw you on the news yesterday.<eos> They were... surprised by what you said.<eos> You don't think I deserve more?<eos> You remember when I graduated college?<eos> You couldn't understand why Mom and Dad would pay for grad school for me, but not buy you a car.<eos> Right after that, you left home.<eos> And I've done fine for myself.<eos> Of course you have.<eos> You always do.
Here... class...<eos> I mean, maybe not class, but...<eos> Whoa.<eos> Sit.<eos> Right.<eos> Got friends upstate doing hard time for selling weaker schwag than that.<eos> Yeah, the government, it's-- it's pretty diabolical.<eos> Do you want some ice cream?<eos> I don't know what you want from me.<eos> Oh, sure you do, Trey.
She's the mother of my children.<eos> Hey, I'm the mother of one of your children, too.<eos> But at least he doesn't refer to my children as a mistake.<eos> You called Christy a mistake?<eos> Bonnie... wait.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> Well... she's a little high-maintenance.<eos> ♪ But I'm not lonely... ♪<eos> Doesn't really work as a duet.<eos> No, it doesn't.
I can't go back there.<eos> Well, babe, I can't just quit my job.<eos> I know how hard this has been on you.<eos> It's horrible what's happened, but you can't run away from your problems.<eos> You got to deal with them.<eos> Mom, my life here is over.<eos> People think I'm a slut.<eos> Well, then the best way to change their minds is to show them that you're not the person that they think you are.<eos> You don't even care.<eos> Of course I...do.
Did they see him exactly?<eos> And he is alive?<eos> When the body is floating towards the treatment plant.<eos> Do you know about the murder of a taxi driver?<eos> Mm.<eos> We would lay low and try not to attract someone's attention.<eos> Now you have the police after you!<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> I certainly hope so.<eos> You did something to me.
How so?<eos> Murdered.<eos> Someone cut his throat.<eos> When?<eos> The day before yesterday.<eos> I was at the scrap yard to warn your brother Tore, but he wasn't there.<eos> Do you have any contact with your third brother?<eos> I need your help, Ylva!<eos> Mm ...<eos> Yes, you do.
Let me know if something happens.<eos> - So she didn't say anything?<eos> - No.<eos> She appeared shocked.<eos> Yes, poor girl.<eos> Only god knows what she's been through.<eos> You haven't been able to identify her yet?<eos> No, she doesn't match any of the other cases.<eos> I think I know who she is.<eos> You do?
Then, you will die here, your bodies never found, both of you.<eos> - Others will come for us.<eos> - We will run.<eos> And they will chase you!<eos> Migizi Pimise, you... you are under arrest for the murder of Edward Graham.<eos> - Sir, they saved our lives!<eos> - You have no authority here.<eos> This is not your world.<eos> We do not follow your laws.<eos> Yes, you do.
Ma'am, I wouldn't be here if there wasn't a case.<eos> I am your Beau.<eos> And "mont," as in you have a mont-umental case.<eos> That's not that good, is it?<eos> "Mon" as in...<eos> You have a monster case.<eos> How about "mont" as in...<eos> You have a case the size of Montana.<eos> These medical bills are going to be astronomical, and you probably don't have the resources to cover that, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
Soon as in now.<eos> Honey?<eos> Yes.<eos> Darling, I want to tell you something.<eos> What's that?<eos> Remember the day I left for the convention?<eos> Well, that morning just plays over and over in my head.<eos> And you said, "I owe you."<eos> Yes.<eos> And I do.
"Will sell quaner of my head for millions..,"<eos> "Salute everyone... herecomes... " "Free flying head"<eos> "Free flying head"<eos> "Free flying head"<eos> Ticket.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> Here.<eos> Stopping me from entering my own house.<eos> Who appointed you?<eos> Who? Your father did.
He'll fly.<eos> He'll fly.<eos> Shivy will fly.<eos> Will Shivy grow wings?<eos> Oh God... I wonder where he is.<eos> Champ...bring a cup of tea.<eos> One?<eos> Sitara never shares her tea.<eos> I don't feel like.<eos> - You don't.
I'm leaving.<eos> What?<eos> Just like that?<eos> Hey, give us ten bucks.<eos> The guy drinks 8 beers with us and leaves 10 bucks.<eos> That's a classic, bro.<eos> I don't believe it!<eos> Hey, how are you?<eos> I thought you didn't use social media.<eos> And I didn't.
Guys vote by flavor?<eos> The best cheese fritter, the best cod, like that?<eos> Fuck.<eos> São Paulo is unreal.<eos> That's how it is there.<eos> Everyone is trying to be the best at something.<eos> Even if it's just a fritter.<eos> But you don't have this view in São Paulo.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, we don't.
It is to me.<eos> You want access to my house, get a warrant.<eos> And tell my brother if he thinks I'm capable of this, he doesn't have a clue who I really am.<eos> You know, he was the runner when we were younger.<eos> I used to wake up at 5:00 a.m. and wait outside his door, and beg him to take me to train with him.<eos> And then in high school I kept going and he stopped.<eos> When was the last time you ran together?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> Do you?
He's gonna fight to keep her around.<eos> Well, his sister lives with a criminal, by her own choice.<eos> Not our problem.<eos> If the mayor asks me to review a case, I have an obligation to review it.<eos> I made no promises.<eos> Well, smells bad to me, boss.<eos> Did you take the opportunity to discuss the pension increase?<eos> Take the opportunity?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
I could just kill you right now.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> Okay?<eos> I know I fucked up.<eos> Murray, can I count on you?<eos> - You can count on me.<eos> Give me another...<eos> - You really think you deserve a second chance?<eos> I do, please.<eos> You do?
- Instruct me.<eos> - The name of the murdered wife is Carolyn.<eos> The name of the murderer is Colin.<eos> The name of the detective is Rick Crowell.<eos> These are all the names of the real people in the Colin Sweeney case.<eos> I am outraged, Your Honor.<eos> Well, you're welcome to your outrage, Ms. Krause, but I am inclined to decide that the plaintiff has proved likeness.<eos> I believe that this episode, though fictionalized, does defame Mr. Sweeney.<eos> Unless you have something else.<eos> I do.
Hold on.<eos> Ow. Okay, okay.<eos> Geez.<eos> Tess?<eos> All right, let's go, let's go!<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I'm saving your life, that's what's going on.<eos> Next time, answer your phone if you want a heads up.<eos> Liam got Alton, didn't he?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Don't be scared.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to help you.<eos> I want to protect you from Liam.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> If you can find me, so can he.<eos> You can't keep running.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
Okay, wh... what if he can't find Liam?<eos> Okay?<eos> What if he can't stop him?<eos> Vincent knows what he's doing, believe me.<eos> Then why did you say you had a bad feeling about this, Detective?<eos> Okay?<eos> I-I'm dying.<eos> And without those meds that Julianna made to keep me alive, I-I don't have much time and I'll be damned if I die before Liam does.<eos> I understand what you're going through...<eos> No, you don't.
I want to believe that I'm past all that.<eos> But Liam is luring Vincent.<eos> It's so hard not to worry.<eos> He has never been tested like this before.<eos> Well, bright side, what better way to find out you're really past all of it once and for all?<eos> ♪ She said a diamond wouldn't hurt... ♪ ♪ Free me ♪ Free me from my...<eos> You used beast vision.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, your eyes glowed. I saw 'em.<eos> No, they did not.
Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Why would you hide this from me?<eos> I didn't want to worry you.<eos> Bull.<eos> It is.<eos> Go on, tell me why.<eos> I guess I just don't want to be weak around you, okay?<eos> I don't.
Oscar, I hate to see you squander your talent just because you're "comfortable."<eos> Okay. You're right.<eos> I'll call Teddy and let him know.<eos> Ah, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh. You know what?<eos> He might say "no."<eos> What if you just did it and let him see how wonderful you are?<eos> You're right.<eos> I am wonderful.<eos> Felix Unger wants a fist bump?<eos> I do.
You smelled flowers?<eos> What kind of flowers?<eos> Flowery flowers.<eos> Flowery flowers.<eos> Look.<eos> We all know what's going on here, okay?<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Aliens.<eos> He said it.<eos> Yeah, he did.
To a fault.<eos> Message received.<eos> We will work on that.<eos> - Well, it's good to meet you at last.<eos> - You as well.<eos> She don't get scared.<eos> Not Hallie.<eos> But me, I can't write.<eos> She say "Boy, you got greatness in you."<eos> You do.
Well, we can do that.<eos> is it because you want to be a field agent?<eos> Or is it because you don't like talking to the brits behind my back?<eos> - Sir...<eos> - It's all right.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> And frankly, well, I'm glad it's you.<eos> So, I can approve your training, or... you can stay right here and we can continue to work together.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying to you?<eos> I do.
- not kill civilians.<eos> - They're not recruit material.<eos> I know how to read people.<eos> I can figure out what they want.<eos> I know how to pull their strings.<eos> What's your plan?<eos> I... I don't know yet<eos> Don't start the fire until we're a half hour away.<eos> Stay out of sight.<eos> Do the boy first.
It has to be this way.<eos> (man): I'm here!<eos> You can't let them take me alive... _<eos> I'm here!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> - Count of three, we fire.<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't need him alive.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Jesus Christ!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - So many elegant uniforms.<eos> A special occasion?<eos> Just an informal gathering to decide some matters close to the Fuehrer's heart.<eos> The Fuehrer... I had no idea.<eos> No, you don't.
I stopped believing in this war a long time ago.<eos> There's a lot more he could tell us, if he wanted to.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Your pencil?<eos> Five platoons... repositioning near Rouen next week.<eos> There are U-boats, here, moving south<eos> - in the Mediterranean.<eos> - If it checks out.<eos> Which we have no way of knowing if it will.<eos> Yes, you don't.
But I have to make it work.<eos> It can't be my trauma getting in the way.<eos> Why?<eos> Because what happened is my fault.<eos> I mean, my maternal instincts, where were they?<eos> I just gave him to the nurse.<eos> Baby... she was wearing a uniform.<eos> She said he needed a hearing test.<eos> But I should've known.<eos> And I didn't.
But you're also a nice hookup and a great writer.<eos> You're not the best camp counselor, though.<eos> You're kind of bad at making arts and crafts.<eos> Please, like you're so great at it.<eos> Gosh, it feels so good to get out of that side braid.<eos> The pulling, how did you do that every day for two years?<eos> Are you ready?<eos> See you later, best friend.<eos> ♪ We'll try to get it right this time ♪ (Jenna) You want to know the best part about knowing who I was?<eos> That Matty did too.
We have to consider everything.<eos> Then there's Occam's razor.<eos> The simplest explanation is the best.<eos> I can't say I blame you.<eos> But I can't say I'll forgive you, either.<eos> You're still here.<eos> Yes. Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You think this is a paid internship.<eos> No, I don't.
Yes. Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You think this is a paid internship.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Because it so isn't.<eos> Yeah, I-I, I figured...<eos> Okay, good.<eos> On the upside, that means your mother's budget cuts won't affect the position.<eos> You know who my mother is?<eos> I do.
Are you ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's over.<eos> Is Joe dead?<eos> No, and I don't know what's gonna happen with his execution, but I need to stick around to see.<eos> What? !<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I need to get closure on this, Gwen.<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> Good because I don't.
Shut up!<eos> Shut up, you sordid bastards.<eos> He said that one man in the city could do as much damage as 1,000 in the field.<eos> - Do not listen to him, sir.<eos> He's lying.<eos> - Hold your tongue.<eos> Do you have proof?<eos> A witness?<eos> No, but you said I would go free if I got a confession.<eos> Ah, yes, I did.
I see.<eos> You know, Jeff, you don't owe me an apology.<eos> I know you did everything you could.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I just got off the phone with the doctor.<eos> I'm afraid it's... bad news.<eos> I am not taking you to St. Petersburg.<eos> You are if you want to know where the safe is.<eos> - How do I even know you've found it?<eos> - You don't.
He went after Bella.<eos> Is she here?<eos> No, haven't seen her today.<eos> Is this Bella?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah, that's her.<eos> Bella Turner.<eos> What was Zack's relationship with Bella?<eos> I don't think he had one.<eos> Nobody does with her.
It's too bad about Zack.<eos> He was always watching your back.<eos> And such a nice back.<eos> Get out.<eos> You're a stuck up bitch who thinks she's too good for anybody.<eos> Ricky, what are you doing?<eos> Zack was an okay guy, and now he's dead, and I think it's because of you, so I came to get what you never gave him.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> You don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Sorry to bother, but...<eos> Step in.<eos> I can come back.<eos> Step in, please.<eos> Thank you, Baker.<eos> You spun me.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> I asked you if Sam had priors.<eos> And he doesn't.
Got your daughter here!<eos> Daddy! Penelope?<eos> Stay down.<eos> Get in there!<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Suspect down.<eos> Restrain him.<eos> Commissioner.<eos> Got a minute?<eos> Sorry, no, I do not.
I have a dying wife who wants me to find a mother for our children.<eos> Are you sure you want a mother for your children who has no shame?<eos> Well, I believe shame is the worst thing a parent can teach their children.<eos> I want my children to be joyful and frank and adventurous.<eos> Like you.<eos> But if parenthood<eos> - is something that doesn't interest you...<eos> - No.<eos> It does, actually.<eos> More so than it does my husband.
You have given Francis something that Mary hasn't and probably never will.<eos> And he likes you.<eos> You could make him very happy.<eos> What more could a mother want for her son?<eos> Kenna.<eos> Bash.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you here.<eos> I've decided it's far past time that I danced with my wife. I'm sorry.<eos> - Bash, you don't need to...<eos> - Yes, I do.
I want to show sacrifice and selflessness!<eos> I'm begging you, please.<eos> What the fuck is sacrifice or selflessness?<eos> I don't want to be a hero, just give my dad the money.<eos> I'm begging you, please. Do it for your mother's sake.<eos> I have no mother.<eos> You may not have a mother, but you used to love your mother.<eos> Do it just to make your mother happy.<eos> Please, just go put the money back.<eos> You do it.
- You can do it, trust me.<eos> From one I9 C3 G6 to another.<eos> It's crazy how much he flirts with me.<eos> Hey, so I told Captain Holt I'd work on Saturday.<eos> Wait, why?<eos> You won fair and square.<eos> I mean, I murdered you.<eos> That was pretty shady.<eos> Also, it was crazy assertive and I feel like maybe I don't actually need power pose training.<eos> You don't.
I photograph him.<eos> Used to make calendars, but now Shackleton is starting a blog.<eos> Shackleton is the goat?<eos> Does this belong to Shackleton?<eos> 'Cause it says Tucker. Where's Roger?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Think harder.<eos> Or we're charging you with accessory after the fact.<eos> After what fact?<eos> What did Roger do?
Only if there's a profitable way to sustain it.<eos> That's exactly right.<eos> And that's why we're here.<eos> Our network is overloaded, limiting our ability to sign up new subscribers.<eos> How do you even know they're out there?<eos> Only 10% of Americans have computers.<eos> Only 15% of them have modems.<eos> Not to mention the fact that you're only on Commodores.<eos> I mean, how do you really know that there are enough users out there to make us all a killing?<eos> We just do.
Gish is on our radar.<eos> We'll have to wait and see.<eos> Yeah, until he kills somebody again.<eos> Until he makes a mistake.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> Hey, it's Gabby.<eos> I need your help.<eos> We all do.
What?<eos> No. Why?<eos> 'Cause I got a package for her.<eos> She texted me.<eos> She said that she had to see her mom or something.<eos> So what was so important you couldn't tell me over the phone?<eos> Okay, Erin...<eos> Is this about Teddy?<eos> Teddy?<eos> No, no, no. Nothing to do with Teddy.
I got her drunk.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Look, girls, I got your pussy in my purse.<eos> Either that's a cat, or you two got to keep better track of your belongings.<eos> Yay!<eos> That cat's back.<eos> See, Max?<eos> I am excited.<eos> [baby talk] Oh, I missed you so much.<eos> Oh, yes, I did.
[baby talk] Oh, there she is.<eos> [cat meows] - Yes.<eos> So I take it by the cat, you're single?<eos> Big time.<eos> So, do you and Dickens live alone?<eos> Oh no, she's trying to flirt.<eos> I travel a lot for work.<eos> I'm a venture capitalist.<eos> So you know how it is.<eos> Oh, I do.
[cat meows] - Yes.<eos> So I take it by the cat, you're single?<eos> Big time.<eos> So, do you and Dickens live alone?<eos> Oh no, she's trying to flirt.<eos> I travel a lot for work.<eos> I'm a venture capitalist.<eos> So you know how it is.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> I absolutely do.
She returned a case to us that she was never supposed to get in the first place.<eos> But you knew that already, right?<eos> This is a Federal domestic terrorism case now, do you understand?<eos> Our job is to protect the homeland, and so far you look like you may very well be a threat to it.<eos> Which means... either you explain your involvement in these suspicious deaths, these maulings, or we'll bring your fiance and anybody else who might be connected in.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Is it?<eos> Look, all I'm saying is that if you're gonna send detectives in to my jurisdiction, to arrest somebody, at lea...<eos> What do you mean the Commissioner's Office told you not to tell me?<eos> What the hell does that...
You look amazing.<eos> Okay, guys, so, we are gathered here to witness<eos> - the coming together between two people<eos> - You look beautiful.<eos> whose hearts and spirits are absolutely entwined as one.<eos> I love you for everything that you are and everything that you make me when I am with you.<eos> You are my partner in life and my one true love.<eos> You are my partner in life and you are my one true love, and I will cherish this marriage always, and I will love you more and more every day.<eos> Do you, Vincent Keller, take Catherine Chandler to be your lawfully wedded wife, to love, honor, cherish and protect?<eos> I do.

Ring.
Bob!<eos> Do you think they're running away from us?<eos> No. Come on!<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, there goes your safety net.<eos> Any sign of them?<eos> No.<eos> Do you think that means that they're, uh...<eos> No, I don't.
you don't want to go where I'm going.<eos> You should get out of town.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> It's this town... and whatever's in it.<eos> What the...?<eos> Y-y-you're not gonna understand, but it's the only way.<eos> I wish you hadn't seen that.<eos> Do you, Rowan Blackshaw, take this man,<eos> Tomas Solano, to be your husband... to have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, to love and to cherish, from this day forward until death do you part?<eos> I do.
And I'll call you back, probably.<eos> When did you realize she was gone?<eos> Half an hour ago.<eos> I went to check if she was sleeping.<eos> She'd torn up Lena's room, and she was gone.<eos> Okay, did you call Lena?<eos> Yeah, she's not answering.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> Jack, what if we don't?
'Cause you weren't here.<eos> Where the hell was I?<eos> With her.<eos> What?<eos> Claire.<eos> What are you doing all the way out here?<eos> Did you hear our news?<eos> Did Peter tell you?<eos> Matthew and I are having a baby.<eos> No, he didn't.
Well, that's a nice offer, but he's gone.<eos> What do you mean he's gone?<eos> I just took Detective Williams to the plane two hours ago.<eos> He's on his way to Bogotá.<eos> But you find that cocaine, and I can guarantee you that the Colombian government will, uh... will approve that.<eos> Give me 48 hours.<eos> Done.<eos> Good luck.<eos> We have no idea where that cocaine is.<eos> No, we don't.
It's some kind of infection.<eos> Looks like Two's been exposed.<eos> Your signal's getting stronger.<eos> I'll zero in on it, then see if I can find you an exit point.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Are you sure you want to wait until it begins?<eos> I can give you an honorable death before it comes to that.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I'd rather have a dishonorable life.<eos> And you did, by all accounts.
There's our matching blood trail.<eos> The police know who you are.<eos> They're here.<eos> You're never gonna get away.<eos> Don't you see, Agent Millwood?<eos> I never planned to leave.<eos> I'm right where I want to be.<eos> I've been waiting for you.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> No, I do.
Have you ever heard of survivors' guilt?<eos> I died in an accident.<eos> Lena wasn't even there.<eos> Well, maybe that's why.<eos> She blames herself.<eos> She was supposed to be on the bus that day.<eos> That's right, but she wasn't.<eos> Instead, she lost her sister, the closest person to her in the world.<eos> And the thing is life forces you to keep on living.<eos> It just does.
What's wrong?<eos> He got out.<eos> I locked it, Ma.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Explain it to me.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Do you know how stupid you are?<eos> Do you?
So, David tells me you were away for a long time.<eos> Rehab?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Don't be shy about it.<eos> I've been through 'em all; rehab, psych ward, boarding school.<eos> I should go check on David.<eos> So we're clear, I'm not big on sharing my toys.<eos> David's mine.<eos> I don't mean to cause any trouble.<eos> Oh, but girls like you never do.
What do we do now?<eos> Mr. bat man?<eos> You know, I'm kind of grateful to that bat now, now that you're going to fuck me.<eos> You're not?<eos> Well, all right, you can go, then.<eos> I can't- I can't get out of it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just like to keep doing that 'til the laughter stops.<eos> Fuck, he's really- This is getting upsetting.<eos> What if I just did that for, like, 40 minutes?
And the bastard was intent on leaving Victoria everything.<eos> I starved him until he had no choice but to pick up the damn pen and sign the new will.<eos> So why come after me?<eos> Aww, honey.<eos> Conrad always wanted me to live like a Grayson, and that's not just about the money.<eos> It's about the power...<eos> The power to make people believe anything you want.<eos> Ruining you was among his greatest accomplishments.<eos> So you want the world to hate me.<eos> Conrad did.
Not right now.<eos> Wait, is that it, right there?<eos> In your apron pocket?<eos> Mm-hmm. So it's in there.<eos> Yeah, come and get it.<eos> Well, it's all dirty now, 'cause it's in your apron with a dirty dishrag.<eos> So dirty.<eos> Hurry up, it's getting all mushy.<eos> Well, I don't really want to now, it has a dishrag on it.<eos> Sure you do.
- that you're upset, you...<eos> - Alfred.<eos> I want you to go and never come back, do you understand me?<eos> You're fired.<eos> Very well, Master Bruce.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Ooh! Shiny.<eos> Give that back.<eos> I saw it first.<eos> No, you didn't.
- What does that spell?<eos> "Oh, no!"<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it!<eos> Ready?<eos> Okay!<eos> This is so embarrassing.<eos> Anyone got a light?<eos> I do.
Sure you're okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Kiss me?<eos> Jim...<eos> Kiss me.<eos> - Oh, bugger.<eos> - Alfred.<eos> - You knew, didn't you?<eos> - I didn't know, Alfred.<eos> You did.
Jim...<eos> Kiss me.<eos> - Oh, bugger.<eos> - Alfred.<eos> - You knew, didn't you?<eos> - I didn't know, Alfred.<eos> You did.<eos> You let me make a right mug of me-self.<eos> Alfred, I had no idea.<eos> - You did.
Previously on Gotham...<eos> My forefathers were betrayed, their legacy erased, and I am here to punish those who wronged us.<eos> - We have a deal?<eos> - We do.
That was an accident.<eos> I'm not that man.<eos> I'm gonna make this right.<eos> See, I knew you'd wake up all boo-hooey.<eos> You probably have half a mind to turn yourself in.<eos> Luckily, I have the other half.<eos> - Do you like magic tricks?<eos> - What?<eos> Of course you like magic tricks.<eos> After all, I do.
Sofia.<eos> I cover five of their franchises as a marketing associate.<eos> I can reschedule.<eos> Yeah, you can.<eos> You know, Coopster told me you were smart, funny, and gorgeous.<eos> If you ask me, he under-promised and over-delivered.<eos> (Giggles) Marketing speak.<eos> Gabi, I just remembered that you have to leave early because you have an appointment.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - You do!
Got a little update for you on that Deberg assault case.<eos> Turns out the victim's wife was super hot.<eos> Yeah, I read the file.<eos> She's a mom.<eos> Not interested.<eos> True that.<eos> So listen, I've been thinking.<eos> We got off on the wrong foot here.<eos> And I believe it's 'cause we're just too damn similar.<eos> - You do?
Yeah, and it was worth it.<eos> Mr. Met used my bathroom.<eos> Number two.<eos> That's a memory I will cherish forever.<eos> Look, mattresses are expensive, but they're an investment.<eos> It's gonna be in your life for a long time.<eos> True, but it's also still just a mattress, you know?<eos> It's a lot of money to spend on a rectangle that's filled with springs and goose hair.<eos> - You know it's feathers.<eos> - I didn't.
I would insist he be there for it so that my husband would have a shoulder to cry on.<eos> Yeah, several years ago, Agneta and Lars were having trouble conceiving.<eos> She didn't even have to ask me to donate my sperm.<eos> I had it already in a "Tooperware," ready to go.<eos> Wow, that's... so gross, yeah.<eos> Can we ask you a question?<eos> - Mm-hm. - Why do you smell like fish?<eos> Is it hygiene?<eos> No, we spent the night cutting open hundreds of dogfish to see if they had diamonds inside.<eos> - Did they?
I had it already in a "Tooperware," ready to go.<eos> Wow, that's... so gross, yeah.<eos> Can we ask you a question?<eos> - Mm-hm. - Why do you smell like fish?<eos> Is it hygiene?<eos> No, we spent the night cutting open hundreds of dogfish to see if they had diamonds inside.<eos> - Did they?<eos> - Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yeah. It would be pertinent to the case.<eos> They didn't.
Flergen! Come on, is that you?<eos> I haven't seen you since Blorgenbergen, man!<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Give me a hand, you old dummy.<eos> It's me, Glurg.<eos> NYPD!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Drop it, you're under arrest.<eos> I hope they have saunas in Swedish prison.<eos> They do, actually.
Oh, bet you'd like to know, eh?<eos> Canadian?<eos> No!<eos> You're so clearly supposed to be German.<eos> - Are any of you German? Mm-mm.<eos> - Russian? Mm-mm.<eos> - North Korean? - Mm-mm.<eos> Greek?<eos> I don't trust the way the Greeks dance.<eos> No one does.
It's not our fault aunt Edie's house has narrow hallways.<eos> Thank you for letting me witness that.<eos> A writer can't stay inside when real life is so chock-full of drama.<eos> Like Axl thought that table could just slide right past that sconce, but then it didn't.<eos> What a great twist.<eos> And then mom expanded my vocabulary with her colorful collection of curse words.<eos> I'm glad I came.<eos> My God. Even with the windows down, I can still smell it.<eos> Sue, I thought you didn't bring your "poo-pourri."<eos> I didn't.
Ah, um... er... can I ask you something?<eos> Of course.<eos> Good, um... and... and I need you to be entirely honest with me.<eos> What is it?<eos> Do you think Camille would be happier staying here or accepting the job in Paris?<eos> Camille is ambitious, adventurous.<eos> She always has been.<eos> Of course she wants to go to Paris and work undercover, and although I'd rather she stayed here on the island, safe from harm, I know it would be best for her to leave.<eos> And you must know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Why didn't you just kill me?<eos> Because we're not like you, Julianna.<eos> We don't just kill people.<eos> Who are you kidding?<eos> Liam sent you.<eos> Who is Liam?<eos> VINCENT: Is that who you were talking about?<eos> The guy you think we're working for?<eos> You really don't know who he is, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
To try and stop Liam.<eos> That's why.<eos> And now you have to.<eos> Okay. Why me?<eos> Because you're a beast.<eos> You're the only one who has a chance, and only then if I inject you with the serum I made, to enhance what you are.<eos> Look, how do we know you're not just making this Liam guy up to justify what you've done?<eos> That is the justification.<eos> Do you think I wanted to experiment on innocent people, and make them super human?<eos> I didn't.
Yeah, agreed.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, uh, actually, can I ask you a question?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why'd, uh, you and JT break up?<eos> He wasn't supposed to tell you.<eos> He didn't.<eos> I just... I used my beast senses.<eos> Vincent, you don't have that power.<eos> No. No, I don't, okay?
Mean, ugly giants.<eos> He saw His mistake and turned them into dust.<eos> He left just a few, then made Adam and Eve.<eos> The Giant Jews multiplied, but grew ever smaller.<eos> - They's our Jews nowadays.<eos> - We didn't know that.<eos> That's why Jews can't stand us Christians, that's why they killed Christ.<eos> And that's why I can't stand them.<eos> - Do you know what I do with pork-haters?<eos> - We don't.
- Boyar Candescu's Gypsy.<eos> We have no such boyar around here.<eos> He's playing the idiot, isn't he, Ionita?<eos> He is.<eos> - Me, playing the idiot?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Me, having a Gypsy here? - Yes.<eos> I tell him I'm a nun and he takes off my habit...<eos> - I don't have any!<eos> - Yes, you do.
Upon my life, master.<eos> He'll beat me!<eos> Shut up, little prince, or I'll smack you.<eos> Father, he's just a poor soul!<eos> A devil's soul...<eos> But the devil can bring in money, too.<eos> Right.<eos> - We know your kind.<eos> - You all say you didn't steal.<eos> I didn't, kind lord...
- Arrested?<eos> - Arrested.<eos> An enemy of the state.<eos> You think you can intimidate me when Olivia's life is on the line?<eos> You think I want this?<eos> Olivia is the godmother of my baby and my friend.<eos> And, believe me, I will avoid at all costs any harm coming her way.<eos> But the fate of our nation is more important than the life and liberty of one individual.<eos> You believe that, don't you?<eos> Of course I do.
I mean...<eos> I'm asking...<eos> Did they hurt you?<eos> I wasn't raped.<eos> Guess what I learned.<eos> There are worse things than rape.<eos> Olivia, don't you dare.<eos> You went to war.<eos> - I had no choice.<eos> - You did.
And if I remember right, 7, just like this guy.<eos> The M.E. said Hightower's were defensive wounds.<eos> Probably happened in the struggle during the riot.<eos> I don't see any obvious defensive wounds on him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need an autopsy.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm gonna go light a fire under Dr. Helpful out here.<eos> I bet all the inmates know exactly what areas are covered by surveillance.<eos> That they do.
They, for the past year, have matching bank activity, and a lot of it.<eos> Like one guy would withdraw cash and the other one would deposit the exact same amount, sometimes as low as 200 bucks, a couple times as high as 2,000.<eos> They even wrote checks to each other.<eos> If I was a betting woman, I would bet that these two have been paying off bets.<eos> That's nice work, baby girl.<eos> Good job.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, take care of yourself.<eos> Come on, you know me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Well, after refueling, repair costs, and docking fees we're left with exactly... zero.<eos> What?<eos> Not even enough for goggles?<eos> Or a nice meal?<eos> Or a redhead?<eos> Sorry, guys.<eos> We're broke.<eos> Now hang on a second.<eos> You said those Mikkei guys gave you a nice bonus for setting up that mining deal.<eos> They did.
Alright.<eos> Take us in.<eos> You should know, weapons are prohibited on the station.<eos> Fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's meet in the airlock in twenty minutes.<eos> Don't forget your comms.<eos> Hey, you find anything worth selling?<eos> No.<eos> Okay well-um, if you do...
We thought we'd lost you there.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Okay I guess.<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> Back on the ship.<eos> Guess there's no place like home.<eos> I saw some more of your memories.<eos> I know what happened to you, I know where you're from.<eos> I already know.<eos> You do?
Hey, you're your own man with your own mind.<eos> I'm sure she'll understand.<eos> If you're not careful, you'll burst a blood vessel.<eos> I'm not in the mood.<eos> I hate to bring this up... Especially as you're picking up a large, heavy object... But i think three might be right about this one.<eos> So you two are best buddies now?<eos> Hardly.<eos> I just think he might have a point.<eos> You were the one that said you didn't Want to go back to what we were.<eos> I don't.
You guys got anything?<eos> Yeah it's in the case over ther.<eos> Don't worry about it, it's not where i keep the good .<eos> No drinking.<eos> Ohhhh! No drinking.<eos> Hey, what's your problem?<eos> We need to toast<eos> This momentous occasion in our relationship, do we not?<eos> No.<eos> We do not.
So why don't you give me the code and this'll all be ove.<eos> I thought you could crack any safe in the galaxy. I can, i just don't have a lot of time right now,<eos> So we're gonna do this the easy way.<eos> If you think i'm gonna give you anything, you can forget it.<eos> Oh no, no, no, no, no, not you, your friends. See, they can either give me the code,<eos> Or they can watch you get blown out into space.<eos> So what's it gonna be, folks?<eos> Don't give him anything. Hey, hey, hey, do you think i'm bluffing?<eos> I mean hell, you're just the first.<eos> After that we do the kid.
Correct.<eos> And healed the wound itself.<eos> I believe that when you were exposed to the cold of space, the nanites migrated to your skin, joined together and formed a protective shield.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> You knew?<eos> I had my suspicions.<eos> Why didn't you say anything.<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> I had no idea this technology even existed.<eos> It doesn't, officially.
No, I don't.<eos> Where's my crew?<eos> They're gone.<eos> What do you mean they're gone?<eos> I mean they left.<eos> They got in their shuttle, flew back to their ship, and they jumped.<eos> No.<eos> They wouldn't just leave me.<eos> [ROOK] They didn't have a choice.<eos> For the moment, at least, neither do you.
If anyone's in there, that's where they'll be.<eos> It's always in the last place you look.<eos> All clear.<eos> There's no one here.<eos> Great.<eos> Now what?<eos> I'm coming down.<eos> What?<eos> You think someone's in there?<eos> No, I don't.
I checked the Yellow Pages.<eos> What's that?<eos> Officer, we're terrified.<eos> Someone just mowed off a deaf girl's head in our backyard.<eos> Well, ladies, you have nothing to be afraid of so long as I'm around.<eos> Though-though technically, I'm not a police officer.<eos> I mean, as you can see, I'm not licensed to carry a sidearm.<eos> I am employed by Secure Enforcement Solutions, which is private contractor hired to work in tandem with campus security.<eos> Wait, so you don't have a gun?<eos> No, I do not.
He kept me in a pit.<eos> Did he dig the pit himself?<eos> How should I know?<eos> Just wondering where you find a house with a pit.<eos> The market for them would be pretty limited.<eos> Did you escape, or did you kill him?<eos> Because if you did, you need to tell us all of the details, including what his eyes looked like when he took his last breath.<eos> They say in that moment, the soul tells all of its secrets.<eos> No, they don't-- no one says that.<eos> Yeah, they do.
!<eos> Everybody agrees that dude was holding you back.<eos> Nobody misses him.<eos> Now let's play some Truth or Dare and find out who the killer is.<eos> Number Five, truth or dare?<eos> Truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> Number Five, does your vagina have teeth?<eos> That's insane.<eos> No, it doesn't, Chanel.
That's insane.<eos> No, it doesn't, Chanel.<eos> I thought she wasn't allowed to lie.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> My vagina doesn't have teeth.<eos> Can I rephrase the question?<eos> Does your vagina still have teeth?<eos> No!<eos> The answer is no! "No, it no longer has teeth, so it used to have teeth, but you got them removed"?<eos> No, I didn't.
Number Two. I would be opening myself up to a lot of trouble if I were to turn you in to the authorities.<eos> It doesn't do any of us any good to start accusing each other with no evidence.<eos> But it is pretty suspicious that you're the one who found her, Hester.<eos> Okay, I understand.<eos> I suggest that we just have someone stand guard and watch me for the rest of the night, or until someone else dies, therefore proving that I am not the killer.<eos> I nominate Chad.<eos> Screw that, Evil Harrington.<eos> We're locking you upstairs in my closet until we can find a way out of here.<eos> This feels so good.<eos> Yeah, it does.
You most certainly won't betray my trust ever again, because you will never have my trust ever again!<eos> Look, we think you need to contact Number Two, and just give her a chance to do right by you.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> ! How?<eos> !<eos> Well, I found this old talking board in the basement.<eos> Yes, they do. Didn't you see the movie?<eos> The movie Ouija?<eos> No!<eos> No one did!
Until old Bird Bones cracks open that dirty beak of heir's and says, "I'm sorry."<eos> Then, yeah, we're not going to see our friend again ever again.<eos> Char-Bar, why aren't you eating these carrots?<eos> She always loves these.<eos> Oh, you know what, hold on a second.<eos> - I'll get Mr. Kooky.<eos> - Okno, no, no.<eos> No Mr. Kooky.<eos> What? She needs him to eat.<eos> No, she doesn't.
I don't think SECNAV would appreciate NCIS treating an admiral like a criminal.<eos> Oh, we already talked to SECNAV.<eos> Mm-hmm. How did she phrase it?<eos> Uh, "nail the son of a bitch."<eos> For what?<eos> Killing Lieutenant Kutzler's first Medal of Honor nomination.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The packet was routed through your chain of command in 2012, Admiral.<eos> Then it must have got lost in the shuffle before it reached my desk.<eos> Because it never did.
And what is this fair beauty's name?<eos> She's sort of named after you, Doctor.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Say hello to Victoria Elizabeth Palmer.<eos> Mother... would be thrilled.<eos> As I am.<eos> Jimmy, what happened to your hand?<eos> Oh. Funny story.<eos> Uh, did you know that epidurals don't work on five percent of patients?<eos> I sure didn't.
Thanks. Is that the little one?<eos> - Yeah, you wanna take him?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - He bites.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> She's like, "I don't care."<eos> Where's your accent from?<eos> You have an accent.<eos> - What does it sound like?<eos> - No, you do.
Like, this guy made money, like...<eos> -He was making $10,000 a day.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Was yours a cream pie?<eos> - No, mine wasn't a cream pie.<eos> It was just a "he came on my stomach" type thing.<eos> Today I did two cream pies, but all I did was just...<eos> I thought they gave you extra for that.<eos> Didn't they?<eos> -Yeah. Yeah, they did. Yeah.
-Okay.<eos> And I want her to stop.<eos> But, I mean, like, I don't...<eos> I also don't want to hold it against her and, like, not be with her because of that.<eos> -It's, like, it was a bad choice in life.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> Her dad doesn't know.<eos> -Doesn't?<eos> -No, he doesn't.
- You heard me.<eos> I know Jessica told you about Hardman.<eos> Yeah, she did tell me, and I have refrained from coming to see you about blackmailing her out of courtesy.<eos> Courtesy?<eos> You haven't so much as wished me a congratulations.<eos> You want me to kiss the ring, Louis, after what you did?<eos> You're damn right I do, because I don't care how it got up there.<eos> My name is on that wall.<eos> And if I had a crowbar handy... I would pry it off.<eos> Well, Jeff, you don't.
Rings a bell, doesn't it?<eos> Rings a bell.<eos> Don't play with me, please.<eos> The Book of the Gates is the origin of this Ministry.<eos> And how do you know so much about this Ministry?<eos> I have very good contacts, in my country and in yours.<eos> Can I continue?<eos> Abraham Levi handed over the book to the Queen Isabella of Castile. In exchange for protection.<eos> I think you know the story.<eos> Yes, I do.
I am going to watch how he painted the frescos in San Antonio de la Florida.<eos> He was not a very good at drawing, but he had enormous power.<eos> It's a day for painters.<eos> We're going to see Dalí.<eos> Ah.<eos> You don't like his work?<eos> He painted like God.<eos> He could make a perfect annunciation on a fingernail.<eos> That has its merit, right?<eos> It does.
This is a delicious meal.<eos> Best meal I've had in some time.<eos> ~ Remember that meal we had Tuesday?<eos> ~ I do. ~ This is better, this meal.<eos> ~ I'm going for a cigarette.<eos> ~ Really?<eos> Do you really have to?<eos> Yup.<eos> Rob, do you smoke?<eos> No, I don't.
By God, can you tell me what happened already?<eos> Lope de Vega was one of the main authors of Spain's History and the Invincible Armada an attempt to invade England, which failed<eos> - When did that happen?<eos> - With your king, Phillip II 17 years after you left.<eos> So, if I hadn't accepted the Ministry's offer,<eos> - now I would be there, in the Invincible Armada<eos> - No, you'd be hanged.<eos> As Miss Folch knows, Lope joined the Armada<eos> Well, we don't know for sure.<eos> - Yes, yes we do.
- Yeah.<eos> I don't know if we've changed History with this or not... but if I'm to be honest, I don't give a damn.<eos> What about Amelia?<eos> She was the first to say we had to save your son.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - It is.<eos> So you can stop complaining about women being in charge,<eos> I never complained.<eos> When did I complain?<eos> Last night you did.
Well, they're your fish.<eos> It should be your decision.<eos> How about dinner?<eos> You just want me to make you dinner?<eos> If it's not too much trouble?<eos> Well, there must be over a dozen fish in that basket.<eos> It seems like you're getting the short end of the bargain.<eos> Well, I'll be the judge of that.<eos> So have we got ourselves a deal?<eos> Apparently, we do.
Guys, will you give us a minute, please?<eos> I just got off the phone with Faith.<eos> You're in luck.<eos> Her uncle's keeping that job open for you.<eos> Who cares?<eos> William Thatcher still wants to see me rot in hell.<eos> Nothing I do is ever gonna be good enough for his daughter.<eos> Well, at least it's a step in the right direction, Tom.<eos> You just think I'm one big screw-up, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
Partying all night.<eos> Girls on tab.<eos> It was crazy.<eos> But if all you actually really want is to meet someone and settle down... ~ .. it's not exactly the right environment, if you know what I mean.<eos> I'd have loved it.<eos> A wife.<eos> A kid.<eos> A family.<eos> Just never seemed to happen.<eos> Well, it did.
~ Said he wanted to put things right.<eos> ~ Did you let him?<eos> ~ Did you forgive him?<eos> ~ No.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> Maybe in time I might have.<eos> But...<eos> So, what did you do?<eos> Hey, hang on. You don't seriously think I had anything to do with his death, do you?<eos> ~ Did you?
I'm no sell-out, especially not that stuff.<eos> I told you, the beer company are delighted with that little clip.<eos> But there was a bigger problem than the bad press that clip might have brought you, wasn't there?<eos> Stevie, the new Stevie... .. didn't want to sell out.<eos> He was still a man of the people... .. and because of that, he refused to sign that contract.<eos> But I told you, he did.<eos> He did sign the contract.<eos> And you saw Stevie sign it?<eos> No.<eos> - Pete did.
Got my tablet back today.<eos> You know, I had all my photos in there and my family stuff.<eos> It was good to see my parents again.<eos> I haven't seen them since the trial.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Well, Sifter and I spoke to the judge.<eos> She agreed to lift your probation.<eos> Wow, that's-that's crazy.<eos> I didn't, I didn't even know he liked me.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.
Stop torturing me!<eos> Oh, for- - Ray, take a picture of him!<eos> Where's my stupid phone?<eos> In Soviet Russia--<eos> Pam?<eos> --Toaster take picture of you.<eos> Doesn't even make sense.<eos> It makes perfect sense.<eos> You don't make sense.<eos> It totally does.
Phillip?<eos> Phil Simms?<eos> I mean, I know you two have worked together or something, but do you really think he's just gonna give you one of his Super Bowl rings?<eos> You've got no idea what the man owes me.<eos> Morning.<eos> Repast.<eos> Couture.<eos> We're going to see the board of directors at Stern Investments.<eos> I didn't know I had any clothes left here.<eos> You didn't.
No, no, you're crazy.<eos> I didn't have...<eos> Detective Bell, could I speak to you over here for a moment?<eos> Would you just...<eos> One second.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You didn't tell me you had a suspect.<eos> I don't.<eos> Or I didn't when I started talking.<eos> I do now.
I'll take one of those, too.<eos> Well, she is Herman's fellow.<eos> Isn't she sort of supposed to follow Herman around?<eos> They're laughing all the time,<eos> And Arizona seems so...<eos> Happy... like really happy.<eos> - So?<eos> - You seem happy... Ish.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I don't, obviously.
- then pull the plug.<eos> - This is...<eos> We don't need to be talking about this.<eos> If I do wake up but I'm dependent on vents or tubes, pull the plug then, too.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're not... you're not dying.<eos> You're not gonna wake up gorked. Shepherd knows<eos> - what she's doing.<eos> She does. - Okay. Sure.<eos> - She does!
And you thought I deserted my own baby?<eos> You did leave.<eos> And then what-- what's up with this note, huh?<eos> Look-- "I'm sorry to leave this way.<eos> I'm not proud of it, but I just can't do this."<eos> This diaper bag is just a recycled purse from my single days!<eos> I got a lot of these notes lying around for quick getaways.<eos> - You guys don't think that I can do this, do you?<eos> - No! - We always thought you could do it.<eos> - I certainly don't.
Ooh, we making a home movie?<eos> - _ - Hello?<eos> Hey, dad.<eos> Dad, take the phone away from your ear.<eos> Why would I do this?<eos> Now I can't hear you.<eos> Put it in front of your face.<eos> Oh! How'd you get in my phone?<eos> Does this mean when we talked the other day - that you knew I was in the can?<eos> - I do now.
I can't use temple funds for anything other than God's work.<eos> You're the high priest!<eos> The arrests I can curtail.<eos> As for these extra funds, they can't come from the temple.<eos> But they could come from a private source.<eos> I'll send Cornelius to collect.<eos> We're to lavish money on Tiberius, the man who expelled thousands of our people from their homes in Rome on a whim?<eos> How far will you go to keep Rome happy?<eos> We don't have the money.<eos> We don't, no.
If he will forgive me, I will be complete in Jesus!<eos> Barnabas!<eos> Reuben!<eos> What's happened to you?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I-I had to walk.<eos> What?<eos> He... he said everything that we thought we knew was wrong.<eos> Who?<eos> Who did?
I do.<eos> I do.<eos> I have looked past God.<eos> I have been proud, and I have been conceited.<eos> I have been an ambassador for violence and hate.<eos> That is past.<eos> What matters is who you now choose to be.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the son of God, who died on the cross and rose again on the third day?<eos> I do.
Let me see.<eos> I've heard from the schools of Shammai and Hillel.<eos> They will all stand with you.<eos> It's nearly time.<eos> Before you go, I... I need to talk to you about your wife.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Yes, governor.<eos> You have enough men?<eos> They understand their duties?<eos> They do.
My Lord.<eos> It's you. The Witness!<eos> CRANE. Uh, I'm sorry.<eos> "The... Witness"?<eos> That's the technical term for us.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> How are you here?<eos> Oh, Abigail, I have so many questions.<eos> So do I. And God do I wish we had more time.<eos> But we don't.
I was making things right.<eos> You brought us back here.<eos> This is your doing!<eos> Katrina, no!<eos> She killed my son.<eos> She dies.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Jeremy. Oh... Oh!<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.
You brought us back here.<eos> This is your doing!<eos> Katrina, no!<eos> She killed my son.<eos> She dies.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Jeremy. Oh... Oh!<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> We all did.
Not the first time I've said that.<eos> See ya.<eos> So, okay.<eos> Alan!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Are you having sex with Lyndsey while you're sleeping with our social worker?<eos> Yeah, my pimp hand is strong.<eos> No, it's not!<eos> Look, look, this thing with Lyndsey just happened.<eos> A-And, honestly, I-I'm glad it did.
It's Olivia.<eos> She's not the best at returning calls, but this is different.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> I know something happened and I just... I really don't want to bother you, but, um...<eos> Have you spoken with her recently?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You knew Olivia was missing.<eos> Yes?<eos> You knew Olivia was missing, and you didn't tell me!<eos> - I didn't.
Come here.<eos> Why?<eos> What do you think, to sort of balance it out?<eos> Whatever you think.<eos> I doubt the baby's gonna care.<eos> It looks good.<eos> Can you get a hammer?<eos> Now?<eos> I don't have a hammer and nails.<eos> - Yes, we do.
It's a side effect of me becoming Adalind and sleeping with Nick.<eos> What side effects?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Juliette, talk to us.<eos> I'm... I'm losing myself.<eos> I need help.<eos> Juliette.<eos> I didn't know you were here.<eos> You told them?<eos> No, I didn't.
Why?<eos> I thought everything pointed to Cole Whitfield being the killer.<eos> It does.<eos> Oh, you believe this theory of Castle's?<eos> I believe that he's been right too many times not to consider it.<eos> Hey, I was just about to call you.<eos> Listen, I've been thinking about it, and with the benefit of hindsight, y-you're right.<eos> I can see how I might have tumbled down the rabbit hole.<eos> Scott Galloway probably has nothing to do with this.<eos> No, he doesn't.
What trickery is this?<eos> You, up there, what is this noise?<eos> Can you see what is happening?<eos> Oh, yes, they are sitting down to dinner.<eos> Sitting down to dinner?<eos> Are they stark raving bonkers?<eos> These people, sometimes, they infuriate me!<eos> Oh, they come out here with their starched uniforms and their stiff upper lips and their dirty great flags hanging out.<eos> - Think they own the place!<eos> - They do.
'Cause they thought I was dead, right?<eos> No, because they thought you died back in '94.<eos> Oh, let's face it.<eos> Creatively, Johnny, you kind of did.<eos> The fact the band broke up the day the album came out made you Belgian cult heroes– very devoted fans.<eos> So when Johnny OD'd on blow two years later...<eos> Which I warned you about.<eos> The "I don't want to die anonymous" verse of Sex Drugs became the fan base's mission statement.<eos> They didn't want you to die anonymous.<eos> Who does, right?
~ Knights of Dorian, yeah.<eos> ~ The ones for kids?<eos> For young adults.<eos> ~ I still write.<eos> ~ Well, good.<eos> You were always funny. Argh!<eos> I had a really good time tonight.<eos> You don't say that to a man, unless you want to kiss him.<eos> Do you want to kiss me now?<eos> ~ No, I do not.
You deserve all the happiness in the world.<eos> I mean, so do I, but that's obviously not happening.<eos> Are you done with your pity-party?<eos> 'Cause I got to speak to Max.<eos> Max, do you want to be my maid of honor?<eos> I would rather be eaten alive by a rabbit.<eos> Which would take a long time and be a lot less embarrassing.<eos> And Sophie, you don't really want me to be your maid of honor.<eos> That's right.<eos> I don't.
Hey.<eos> Sorry, we were up late talking.<eos> Family meeting in the living room.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Who knows?<eos> But I'm not getting a "Hey, kids!<eos> , we're going to Disneyland" vibe out of it.<eos> - They're getting divorced.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I miss us too.<eos> There we are.<eos> Where?<eos> Right here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean... I think...<eos> We should be us again.<eos> Together.<eos> You want to get back together?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I saw it on the microfiche.<eos> We don't have to talk about it.<eos> Wow! You're so understanding.<eos> Do you, Jonas Jurgenson...<eos> I mean, Gene Jenkinson... take this woman, Gail Dana Starfield, to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> Boy, and how.<eos> And do you, Gail Dana Starfield, take this man, Jonas...<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> Gene Jenkinson, to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.
You pulled it off.<eos> Hey, why don't you drop by the club on Sunday?<eos> We could use a fourth.<eos> Sorry, Martinson, I won't be able to make it.<eos> I'm busy that day.<eos> Well played, Jim.<eos> Well played.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - You did it.
Now where's Jack?<eos> Oh, hey, mom, bad news.<eos> He's holed up in his office.<eos> I'm not sure what happened.<eos> Something about losing something.<eos> Well, the last time I lost two guys this fast, was when I told the three guys I was dating in high school I was pregnant. (Laughs)<eos> You may have gotten rid of Frank, but it doesn't matter.<eos> I'm still gonna win. Do you just wanna concede now?<eos> If concede means I win, then I do.<eos> - It doesn't.
That's not supposed to happen.<eos> It's not her fault.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I was the one who recommended Danny and Baez for the Medal for Valor.<eos> And you didn't tell me?<eos> I knew how you'd feel about it.<eos> Why didn't you just tell me this morning?<eos> Because I knew how you'd feel about it.<eos> As I recall, you had plenty of problems with Danny when you were his boss.<eos> Yes, I did.
That's the address.<eos> You have no idea how many times I wanted to burn that piece of paper.<eos> How long will you be gone?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come here.<eos> You be safe and you come home soon.<eos> We haven't got many days left.<eos> I don't want to be alone at the end.<eos> I know, Mum.<eos> None of us do.
Very off the record.<eos> No-one else in this room can know.<eos> Morning, ladies, rise and shine.<eos> Listen, I know you're wanting to stay off the grid and everything, but I really need to talk to my husband and son.<eos> You see, my husband, he's in the hospital, and I need to make sure that the doctors are still showing up for work.<eos> I don't even know where my son is.<eos> So, really, it is very stressful.<eos> Rhonda, relax, OK?<eos> We have all the time in the world.<eos> Yeah, but we don't, do we?
You are the second guy.<eos> Please, you have to tell the truth.<eos> Hey, did you see that article?<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Ben!<eos> Thank you so much for saving me!<eos> You are just, oh, the best boyfriend in the world.<eos> True.<eos> We both know I didn't do the saving.<eos> Now everyone else does too.
You remember.<eos> You... you... you took pity on me, and I am glad for it.<eos> Ray, where's Tracy?<eos> Call's coming from an unlisted number.<eos> He's on a burner phone.<eos> Still triangulating.<eos> The wind was blowing, and we just... we rolled down the windows even though it was cold.<eos> We didn't even care because the music was blasting on the stereo.<eos> You remember that?<eos> Yes, I do.
We don't want to smell your shit all night.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Hey, vamos!<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> 8 pesos, Presidente.<eos> I did not bet that bird, chuparlo.<eos> Yes, you did, mi General.<eos> 8 pesos.<eos> How is it you have 8 pesos to bet with?<eos> As a fact, I do, Excellency.
The man retreats to victory and then transmogrifies himself by grog house gaggle into a hero... a hero that'll sweep his ass right into this office.<eos> That's President Jackson.<eos> He and Houston want to annex our Texas.<eos> Always been his plan to suck Texas up in the states.<eos> We'll publicize the fact that the... the big drunk, he abandoned his post with a wound that didn't prevent him from whoring and boozing while Texas wallows in hunger and chaos.<eos> Expose his unholy affinity for savages.<eos> Yes, he's the greatest curse that Providence in all its wrath has sent to our country.<eos> Sullied the reputation of countless women, abandoned two wives.<eos> If the people truly knew him as we do...<eos> But they do.
_ Ah! What's Beans' real name?<eos> It's Lloyd or Leonard.<eos> Heard somebody say it once.<eos> Name was George or Josiah or Jeremiah.<eos> No, no, no, Maurice or Bene... Benedict?<eos> I hate to say it, gentlemen, but it must've been something prissy, right?<eos> Because... I mean, like, Archibald or Percy or something, because otherwise, why... why wouldn't he use his own name?<eos> A man needs his Christian name on his grave marker.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yes, he does.
Now I know you have plenty of infantry and cannon, but hardly any horse.<eos> My dragoons can be anywhere on the battlefield they're needed, whether it's to harass Clinton's flanks or to punch holes through his lines.<eos> And we're damn good scouts as well.<eos> You'll be serving under my direct command, is that clear?<eos> It is... sir.<eos> Miss Shippen.<eos> I am so pleased that you could come.<eos> I was happy to, if only to thank you again for your intervention with that mob.<eos> Of course. Did you see the house?<eos> I did.
Many would agree with you.<eos> I doubt he is more formidable than General Johnny Burgoyne.<eos> When I surrounded him at Saratoga, he had no choice but to yield to my demands.<eos> Finally.<eos> I thought he'd never fall asleep.<eos> It's too much excitement for one day.<eos> He'll sleep soundly now, though.<eos> He's had his fill.<eos> He'll sleep soundly because his father's home.<eos> I did a lot of thinking in prison.
- Let's get some wine.<eos> - All right.<eos> Elka, what are you doing here?<eos> Isn't this your bowling night?<eos> I'm not leaving this house until this bet is over.<eos> Now, get off my tail.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> No, you're standing on my tail.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to leave the house to appear on The Grill.<eos> No, I don't.
Ah. How big, Joy?<eos> How big is the big thing?<eos> It's big.<eos> Joy, I think I need to know what the big thing is.<eos> All right. Wait.<eos> I heard you talking about how you'd always dreamed of having kids, and I felt terrible.<eos> You should be marrying someone you can have children with.<eos> Joy, you're the woman I want to marry.<eos> If you don't want to have kids, that's fine.<eos> But I do.
They've got launch control, more power and they're lighter.<eos> It's come up here what I have to do to engage the launch control.<eos> So, "deactivate dynamic stability control.<eos> "Select sequential mode with drive programme three."<eos> That sharpens up the gear changes.<eos> "With the engine running, depress the brake with the left foot."<eos> Done that.<eos> "Push the selector lever forwards and hold.<eos> "A flag symbol appears in the instrument cluster."<eos> It doesn't.
'Darkness had fallen 'when we finally reached the bottom of the farm drive.'<eos> Joy of joys!<eos> 'But...it took another two hours to reach 'the farmhouse at the top of it...'<eos> ~ Welcome.<eos> ~ Thank you.<eos> '.. where there were no spare bedrooms.<eos> 'So I decided to try another new sort of tenting.'<eos> ~ Do you know what?<eos> ~ What? ~ We started this, I liked all three cars.<eos> I still do.
'When my work was done and May and Hammond had drunk all the beer, 'we turned in for the night.'<eos> ~ What was that? !<eos> ~ That was the sound of me saving your life.<eos> 'The next morning, our campsite looks like an abattoir.'<eos> ~ What's this?<eos> ~ Crocodile's ear.<eos> ~ It's hairy.<eos> ~ Crocodiles do have hairy ears.<eos> They don't even have ears.<eos> They do.
It's important.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> We're gonna find him.<eos> He doesn't want to be found.<eos> We'll bring him home.<eos> Travis, he'd rather sleep in that place than his own bed.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know if I want him to come home.<eos> I get it.<eos> You do?
What have I done?<eos> Girl, where you at?<eos> Danny, come on.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> - Do you mind?<eos> - Not like what?<eos> Hey, I've got Danny in my back pocket, so how about I wait and see if things work out with Ben first?<eos> That's not true.<eos> I didn't know how I felt.<eos> And you do now?
- We will start tonight.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Now, I don't want to rush you, but Becky's waiting, and it wasn't easy getting this appointment.<eos> Maybe we should skip it.<eos> Since she does your hair, I'd probably just end up looking like a big whore.<eos> [chokes] Lauren.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> You have not been yourself lately.<eos> I think I know why.<eos> You do?
Shut up.<eos> Have you told her how you're going to save her?<eos> Are you kidding me? !<eos> Give me the envelope, or I'll kill the kid!<eos> I will.<eos> Does she know about the bunker is all?<eos> What? !<eos> Does she know about the bunker?<eos> No, no. OK?<eos> She doesn't.
Do you think I should join the army?<eos> No. Are you sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rae!<eos> Is that...<eos> Katie Springer? !<eos> Hang on, who's Katie Springer?<eos> She looks amazing.<eos> Yeah, If you like that kind of thing.<eos> Which everyone does.
Oh, er, yeah, yeah!<eos> I'm sure he'll appreciate it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good luck, Arch!<eos> Oh, cheers, Danny.<eos> Thanks for making me do this..<eos> Hey, listen, Archie...<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
I need to pass my exams, so I can still go to Bristol."<eos> Why didn't people tell you when they were coming round?<eos> That way, you wouldn't have to answer the door looking like<eos> Joseph and his technicolor dreamcoat.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You can't force someone to drive.<eos> I did.<eos> - Now her parents hate me.<eos> - They won't hate you.<eos> Her mum does.
Ah, damn it, now I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> So, how you doing?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Thanks again for seeing me.<eos> It's very kind of you.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Is this Alvin?<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't know he wanted to be cremated.<eos> He didn't.
If for some reason that doesn't work, I've got Parker right behind me as a backup.<eos> I'm guaranteed to sit with one of them.<eos> That's a good plan.<eos> But remember... once you're in, do not leave, all right, because... well, here, let me show you.<eos> Once, I... I left to go get a coffee stirrer, right?<eos> Then the next thing I know, that ponytailed, tofu-head barista is sitting with Shelly.<eos> They're getting married on Saturday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you know I can't drink coffee anymore, Brick?<eos> I did not.
I had more countries.<eos> Yeah, but I had just rolled a 6.<eos> I was about to take over Asia.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> I remember now.<eos> You rolled a 6 off the board.<eos> - It doesn't count.<eos> - Does.<eos> - Doesn't.
No.<eos> - Ron.<eos> - No, I don't want a haircut.<eos> Look, I just gave myself one.<eos> All right?<eos> It's all set up.<eos> Don't make me do it again next week.<eos> Take off your hat.<eos> - This is bullshit.<eos> - What did you just--
Actually, I've kind of noticed you checking her out in the rearview.<eos> You're so pretty, Carrie.<eos> I mean, I'd kill for pores like that.<eos> Can I get my video game back again?<eos> If you promise to stop talking, okay?<eos> Come on, get up there!<eos> No!<eos> You guys, are we gonna pull over soon?<eos> 'Cause Doc says I got to move every couple hours, or the fluid builds up, and that's when the gastro esophageal reflex kicks in, and you do not want to smell it.<eos> No, we do not.
February 9, 2001, full moon.<eos> I remember you ditched me to play blackjack all night.<eos> Yeah, and I came back to the hotel room $8,000 up.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> All that cash.<eos> All that cash?<eos> That's what you remember?<eos> So about that thing.<eos> I went to see a guy, um, who I thought might know something about Warner's murder.<eos> - And did he?
Who's that with Carrie?<eos> Hunter Ellis.<eos> Has a long sheet.<eos> Could be involved in the heist.<eos> He took a shine to Carrie.<eos> Really?<eos> How come I'm just hearing about him now.<eos> She just remembered him from a pile of photographs of Ganz's associates.<eos> It's not that you have a history of lying, but you have a history of lying.<eos> We both do.
And, um... one more thing.<eos> What?<eos> Can I ask you to pray for me?<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> There's a friend in the hospital.<eos> He asked me to pray for him, but I just... I-I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I-I don't believe in it.<eos> The way you do.
I don't know.<eos> Thanks for bringing that up.<eos> Fun chat.<eos> (Gina) Just say you're a captain now, and you're busy running a precinct, so he can go suck an egg.<eos> Or we can all work together all night long, and I'm sure we can eventually figure it out.<eos> I like that, Terry.<eos> It shows real heart.<eos> But I'm going with Gina's "suck an egg" idea.<eos> You get the Beyoncé tickets.<eos> Of course I do.
Ha!<eos> I'm also in charge of the gifted and talented program.<eos> The one Izzy's trying to get into.<eos> On the other hand,<eos> I love what you've done with the office.<eos> Daniela's right.<eos> You are really rockin' those shorts.<eos> Is there a Mrs. Whistle? why do you have my egg timer?<eos> You don't know how to make eggs.<eos> Yeah, I do.
A great variety of them, in fact.<eos> Blackouts were not uncommon.<eos> And on this night in particular, the 7th of December, 2011?<eos> I do not believe I could be much clearer.<eos> I have no recollection of this woman or anything that might have happened to her.<eos> Guys, it's a note.<eos> Received by our Vic the day she disappeared, one your consultant just admitted he wrote.<eos> She was a cleaner, maybe he wanted to hire her.<eos> Before we came here, you said this was a waste of time, you knew your guy.<eos> I do.
I don't believe it.<eos> The guys at the 3-5 do.<eos> Right now, that's all that matters.<eos> I don't suppose you were able to put a name to the witness.<eos> They're keeping everything under wraps.<eos> Like they should.<eos> Holmes is not a cop, but he's close.<eos> They got to protect their case.<eos> You have any luck with that list I sent you last night?<eos> We did.
You're not just a pretty face, are you?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> So maybe you should buy me a drink, and we can continue this conversation in the corner.<eos> Jay? ♪ ♪ Sean, what are you doing in my building in the middle of the night?<eos> I thought we were done with you following me.<eos> I'm not following you.<eos> I'm waiting for you.<eos> I need your help.<eos> You need my help, or the SEC needs my help?<eos> We both do.
There's no chance, guys. No chance.<eos> All right, let's do this, man.<eos> It's time to put up or shut up.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Going down, boys.<eos> Mr. West, I know that you always drive the Batmobile, but it would be an honor and a privilege if you allowed me to drive the Batmobile today.<eos> You drive the Batmobile?<eos> It's always been a dream of mine.<eos> Do you have a driver's license?<eos> I do.
Our intelligence missed it.<eos> Not only that, but we brought them here, which means if Fahad was killed because he didn't agree with the plan...<eos> Then his death is on us.<eos> Stick with Richards.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> I want to talk to the guy at the DEA who trained those two soldiers.<eos> If anybody has a better idea of what we're dealing with, it'll be him.<eos> Well, let's hope he's easier to find than Richards.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yes, we do.
Where's the woman that was like... there?<eos> Where's the woman...<eos> Kate?<eos> Kate!<eos> Kate!<eos> I want to tell you what I did.<eos> In the States, you get a lot more bang for your buck cos you can use dollar bills, y'all!<eos> You've already given me like £300.<eos> Rob, I need to talk to you.<eos> Do you?
Oh, yes, Chief.<eos> Your father called.<eos> ~ Oh... ~ Something about no hot water?<eos> OK. Thank you. Any news on the green car?<eos> Nothing fitting that description has been bought or sold in the past three months.<eos> And from what I can make out, nothing like that has been stolen either.<eos> So... .. a man is shot dead, inside his locked cell, located within two additional locked security doors.<eos> There's no way the killer could have come in via the prisoner entrance, which can only be unlocked and opened from the inside.<eos> And to come from the courthouse entrance, the killer must have passed Dwayne and JP, unseen, unheard.<eos> Which they didn't.
It's a hard-enough job as it is, but with no one to go home to...<eos> Never met the right guy.<eos> I realize it may be uncomfortable for you to talk about your personal life, but I just want to give you an opportunity to tell me anything I might need to know.<eos> Any romantic relationship that could have possibly compromised you in any way?<eos> I don't date much.<eos> I was involved with an agent in the office a couple of years ago-- Chris Amador.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I was more involved with him than he was with me.<eos> But I'm sure you know what happened with Agent Amador.<eos> I do.
Ever since that phone call this morning.<eos> All of the extra precautions at the lab,<eos> - and all of this hovering.<eos> - I'm being responsible.<eos> I'm not your responsibility.<eos> Yes, in fact, you are.<eos> When you're in a stitch, and you're waltzing around some dead person's memory, it is my job to keep you safe.<eos> I know what I signed up for and I know all the risks.<eos> All the risks? No.<eos> You don't.
- Christopher.<eos> - Hey, Donna.<eos> Is everything okay? [laughs] Um... There's no easy way to say this.<eos> My replacement Chief at 51, he's been ordered to step down.<eos> You're going back to work.<eos> (Boden) I'm afraid I've got no choice, Donna.<eos> Well, I hate for you to go, you know that.<eos> I know.<eos> - But if they need you...<eos> - They do.

I think he's drinking it neat.<eos> I like to think it might be really helpful if you just sit down and have a chat about your problems.<eos> You know?<eos> With someone who has compasionate views.<eos> Is this just because Padraic was hiding in your closet?<eos> Sure he does that here.<eos> He'll come out of the closet when he's good and ready.<eos> To be honest Deb, we have tried stuff.<eos> Books, and watching Dr. Bill.<eos> We even did a mediation thing with the priest.
Narrator: Previously on rogue...<eos> -What is this?<eos> -Guns for product.<eos> Are you telling me marty stein is a drug dealer?<eos> Stein ain't no dealer, stein's a kingpin.<eos> We need you to tell marlon you know where leo's hiding out.<eos> I do?
Why do you have hutchings' camera?<eos> -What?<eos> -Why did you have hutchings' camera?<eos> That's what this is about?<eos> You couldn't just ask me?<eos> Did you get it before or after the murder?<eos> I'm worried about you, I am.<eos> I gotta take a piss.<eos> I do.<eos> I really fucking do.
-What?<eos> -He knows about the guns?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> He knows about the storage locker?<eos> He's the one that put 'em there, marty.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just sit tight, I'm gonna get you out of here.<eos> I just need to make a phone call.<eos> -You got something more pressing right now?<eos> -Yes, I do.
None of this ever bothered you?<eos> I didn't think about it.<eos> No, you chose not to.<eos> Did you know about hutchings?<eos> Hutchings stole some file from marty's firm.<eos> Marty says, "go get the file."<eos> You know, clean house, make sure nothing's there That attaches hutchings to marty.<eos> And that's when you took the camera?<eos> I swear to god, I didn't know they were gonna kill him.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Okay.<eos> But I know you're not here to talk about basketball.<eos> Yeah.<eos> M.E.'s office was able to get a DNA profile on the knife used in your mother's murder.<eos> It was remarkably well-preserved, apparently.<eos> The M.E. ran it through CODIS, and it got a hit.<eos> Just say it, Erin.<eos> It matched your father, Ennis Walker.<eos> I knew it would.<eos> You did?
The president asked you to serve, and you said yes.<eos> So before you turn your back on a job that only 47 people have had in the history of this nation, I need to hear why you said yes in the first place.<eos> I have a 10-year-old daughter.<eos> Her name is Casey.<eos> I want her and every other child in this country to grow up in a nation that will allow them to fulfill their dreams just like I'm doing right now.<eos> Well, that's very inspiring, senator Ross.<eos> But the truth is, if confirmed, you will be one horrible tragedy away from the presidency.<eos> With your lack of experience, how do I know that you're prepared to protect us against Russia or the North Koreans?<eos> Simple.<eos> You don't.
What, does he want to watch?<eos> 'Cause that costs extra!<eos> Hey!<eos> No.<eos> You have a heart condition.<eos> Sit.<eos> He is in breach of contract.<eos> I want that whore out of my house.<eos> The contract says I can have a life as long as I'm discreet.<eos> Yes, it does.
Do you understand?<eos> I wasn't implying...<eos> I have a position.<eos> You have a job.<eos> You fix.<eos> That's your job.<eos> You fix or you leave.<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> - No, I...<eos> - Because if you do...
I wasn't implying...<eos> I have a position.<eos> You have a job.<eos> You fix.<eos> That's your job.<eos> You fix or you leave.<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> - No, I...<eos> - Because if you do...<eos> I do not.
We met like two weeks ago.<eos> A gold heart!<eos> Really? I just -<eos> - I guess I'm just more into the chase right now. You know, like, the fun.<eos> I'm just not looking for anything serious.<eos> Well, it's good you know what you want -- before anyone got hurt.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Of course I have the receipt. Ow! ...<eos> Kay, what if I didn't?
I doubt she wants to be ambushed at her house.<eos> No-no-no-no, she absolutely would.<eos> Oh, yeah, just call her babysitter and let her know.<eos> - Okay, if you say so.<eos> - Oh, I say so!<eos> - Victory?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Billy is gonna lose his mind.<eos> You knew Wilbur was smuggling?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Anything else, Dr. Carlin?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Recently she's developed a deep-seated paranoia.<eos> Paranoid?<eos> About what?<eos> She's convinced that she's being watched.<eos> It was about the break-in?<eos> Nice outfit, Soto.<eos> Liked it better when you wore it yesterday.<eos> Oh, I did? Hm.
I know a few things I'd burn down.<eos> - Want some?<eos> - l could die for some.<eos> - A guy ready to die for sausage!<eos> - l know plenty.<eos> I'll introduce you.<eos> Eugéne...<eos> Jean, the new guy I mentioned.<eos> He wants to butcher the foreman too.<eos> Everyone does.
Dynamite.<eos> They found him in two pieces.<eos> Dynamite can't abide clumsiness.<eos> He was planning an attack?<eos> No, he was just trying to impress some guys.<eos> Nihilists he and Elisée met in Brussels.<eos> Austrians.<eos> Elisée's waiting for them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Anyway, thanks, Pablo.<eos> Kelly, if you really hate what did this, you should come with us.<eos> Let's bring the fight to it.<eos> I mean, I guess I don't know what else I would do.<eos> Well, she shouldn't be alone right now.<eos> Plus, you're kinda like a young me.<eos> Deadites ruined your life and you're hot as hell.<eos> Okay, let's get to the book store and hit the undo button on this BS once and for all.<eos> You know they were Jewish, right?<eos> I - I did not.
Oh France is wonderful!<eos> Want to go home?<eos> I'll go home and take you too.<eos> Dream on.<eos> I can't believe I raised you. - Get out.<eos> - Where did you come from?<eos> You drive me so mad, I could go out without a headscarf.<eos> I said leave.<eos> Why did you call her useless? A she-donkey?<eos> - Did you or didn't you?

I'm obliged to believe you!<eos> Anyway, I don't have a choice!<eos> I have to trust you, is that it?<eos> Well, one day you'll hear shrieks and... I'll blame Artus or the TV.<eos> It's too easy!<eos> Too easy?<eos> You listen to me. A jealous man destroyed me.<eos> I'm done with that!<eos> You don't order me about.<eos> No one does!
Your pronouns suggest otherwise.<eos> Hey, Jodi.<eos> Hey.<eos> This is my mom, Bonnie.<eos> Hi.<eos> We're gonna grab coffee with some girls from the meeting.<eos> Do you want to come with us?<eos> I can't.<eos> I got plans.<eos> No, you don't.
That's crying.<eos> I deserve... a raise.<eos> I think...<eos> What?<eos> I deserve a raise.<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> I deserve a raise.<eos> Thank you for listening.<eos> You know what?<eos> You do.
You need hand grenades, machine guns, explosives.<eos> You let me know.<eos> I got it.<eos> You wanna blow up a goddamn car,<eos> I'll set you up.<eos> Give you no shit to send a car over the river into New Jersey, no sweat.<eos> [Click] We're done here.<eos> All right.<eos> You need anything, you know where to find me.<eos> - Yes, I do. - [Chuckles]
- She probably was a guy.<eos> - She was wearing a dress,<eos> - and she had makeup on.<eos> - All right, that's enough.<eos> Can we change the subject, please?<eos> Yeah, guys, mind your own business and finish your homework, will you?<eos> Come on.<eos> We haven't been out in months. What do you say?<eos> Do I really have a choice?<eos> No, you do not.
Like I said, Rust, I'm behind the bar, I'm reading the paper.<eos> Next thing I know, O'Reilly's got his throat slit, he's bleeding all over the floor.<eos> Rogers is against the bar.<eos> He's been stabbed in the shoulder... you couldn't do nothing, Burke?<eos> - Nothing at all?<eos> Hey, you got a gun behind the bar, right?<eos> Did you forget how to use it?<eos> Did you?<eos> - Whoa, whoa, Rusty, Rusty!<eos> Did you?
Listen to me.<eos> You got to listen to me. Please.<eos> I can't let anybody find out about this.<eos> You understand?<eos> I mean, if anybody finds out about this, you know what they're gonna do to me.<eos> Yeah, I completely understand, which is why you need to tell me whose joint this is, or I'm gonna have to tell every bartender on 10th Avenue how you've been spending your Saturday nights.<eos> Come on.<eos> What? We go back a long way.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, we do.

Okay, um... about a month back, I'm-I'm... I'm minding my own business, cops roll up on me outside the Federation Bar, and they start accusing me of killing a guy.<eos> They said I was beefing with him over some girl in the bar.<eos> Not true?<eos> No, I-I've never been in the Fed Bar.<eos> What were you doing outside?<eos> I was taking a walk.<eos> Alone?<eos> So to recap-- I.D.'d at the scene of the crime, no alibi, and name on a vigilante hit list.<eos> And your response is: "I was taking a walk."<eos> What do you...?
Why am I the only person fighting for us?<eos> This is fighting for us.<eos> No, this is running away.<eos> We've never spent this much time apart.<eos> I mean, what... what if we can't come back from this?<eos> I mean, what if this is the beginning of the end?<eos> We promised each other... roommates in college and... and houses next door to each other.<eos> Best friends forever.<eos> Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.

"To protect an informant in an active operational zone"?<eos> With respect, I don't appreciate your sarcasm, Your Honor.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, here's what I don't appreciate, counsel.<eos> I don't appreciate being instructed as to what will or will not happen in my courtroom.<eos> Your Honor, if I may...<eos> A citizen of this district has been brutally murdered...<eos> Not just a citizen, but a public servant, a lieutenant for the Metro P.D.<eos> And the people have a right to access and evaluate all evidence...<eos> No, they don't.
Agent Keen, what a pleasure.<eos> But you said you didn't know him, you'd never met him.<eos> Did he, what, just expect you to believe him?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I had no idea what he expected.<eos> I'm a criminal.<eos> Criminals are notorious liars.<eos> Everything about me is a lie.<eos> You must have known how strange all of this was.<eos> Of course I did.
Well, that went as well as could be expected.<eos> We got a lead on Keen and an invitation to sit in the Minister's box at next year's Slasher Cup.<eos> Cultural peculiarities notwithstanding, I find cockfighting to be abominable.<eos> However, truth be told, I do love fried chicken.<eos> You need to tell her, Raymond.<eos> Tell her what?<eos> About Tom.<eos> You should have told her some time ago.<eos> I don't know how do that, Dembe.<eos> Yes, you do.
There's this saying...<eos> Hi.<eos> - You're early.<eos> I thought we said 1:00.<eos> - We did.<eos> But I was thinking about the Black Business Leaders speech.<eos> Oh, yes. I was just working on it now.<eos> Well, I... I'm having second thoughts.<eos> I think it's a mistake to throw Peter under the bus.<eos> You do?
I like Mary.<eos> No, I appreciate that, but you don't know her like I do.<eos> I mean, she's not gonna just, you know...<eos> Mary!<eos> Act naturally.<eos> We're taking her to see an acquaintance at St. Bede's.<eos> What acquaintance?<eos> Neurologist.<eos> Okay, does she know that?<eos> Of course she does.
I'm way ahead of you there.<eos> So...<eos> No!<eos> Extra care here, gentlemen.<eos> Let's get these beauties home to Greece with all their fingers and toes.<eos> The ones they still have anyway.<eos> We'll take them from here.<eos> Excuse me? I'm taking these statues.<eos> I have no authorization to release these to anyone.<eos> Now you do.
Is it...<eos> Miyuki?<eos> What?<eos> You called me?<eos> Miyuki?<eos> It popped in my head.<eos> I wanted to sing it.<eos> It's a song I used to know...<eos> I know that song.<eos> You do?
I forgot my phone.<eos> I turned round, go back and get it.<eos> - So you don't deny it was you?<eos> - Why would I?<eos> So you just happened to be on the exact same road at the exact same time Annika was snatched.<eos> It's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?<eos> - Jason!<eos> - Mr. McCready, if you'd like to stay here with us, thank you.<eos> Looks deserted.<eos> It does, doesn't it?
And then Katrin...<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Katrin Vesik was looking for her sister and found out about the slaves, didn't she?<eos> - No comment.<eos> - That's why she was killed, wasn't it?<eos> - To shut her up.<eos> - No comment.<eos> Do you know what the Coroners and Justice Act is?<eos> He does.
Dave might have stolen my TV, but I can't let him steal my big heart.<eos> Or your kidney, which you might have lost had you slept here last night.<eos> Hi. I got your wine.<eos> And if you run out, the store is open till 11:00.<eos> Seriously, Mike, you can't bring yourself to pay for a shopping bag?<eos> No, when I was a kid, the grocery store wouldn't charge you for a grocery bag.<eos> Plus, all the food you ate while you were in the grocery store was free.<eos> - No, it wasn't.<eos> Not ever.<eos> - Yeah, if you do it fast.
No, his lawyer, Jeremy.<eos> If you want to get ahead, you need to start playing by their rules.<eos> - I need to kill a hooker - (Groans)<eos> No!<eos> No, you need to reel in the big fish!<eos> Okay, trust me.<eos> You gotta schmooze 'em and booze 'em, or you're gonna lose 'em.<eos> I don't even know where to start!<eos> Where do I go?<eos> What do I do?
I have tried everywhere else.<eos> The Society is my last throw of the dice. Sir!<eos> We're growing stale, we need fresh opinions.<eos> Oh, I'm... I'm afraid that those books have been sold, sir.<eos> - I reserved them!<eos> - Yes, I am sorry for it, sir.<eos> Oh, it is no matter.<eos> Do you have anything upon the nature of clouds, rain, atmospheres?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.
I will return.<eos> When I take over the management of my own estate...<eos> You always told me you hated farming, Jonathan.<eos> - Will such a thing do for you?<eos> - Well... You once said you would rather put out your own eyes than spend one moment managing the estate.<eos> - All right, I'm going to study magic.<eos> Will that do?<eos> - Why on earth would you want to do that?<eos> I met a man under a hedge who told me I was a magician.<eos> - Did you indeed?
- I have not, but it restaurant my stepmother I call it ...<eos> - No, sorry.<eos> - I know him, this is one of us.<eos> The series "occupation" Series sixth - "September"<eos> - I want to pick up the phone.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Do not you trust me?<eos> - Still nothing.<eos> - Likes to blow up?<eos> - No, I did not do.
Oleg, the people at Table Two want to know what's in the veggie burger.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
That's Sophie's cry.<eos> I know, 'cause I hear it through the vent when she watches Nashville.<eos> Sophie? (Sophie) No.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> (Sophie) It's not me, but I'm okay. [sobbing continues] Sophie, why are you crying?<eos> When I heard what you said about the dresses... It's just--<eos> It's almost, kind of like, you think I have bad taste or something.<eos> No.<eos> Caroline thinks you have great taste.<eos> She does?
I found something in the files you gave me... A connection between Christoph and zhulov.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - No.<eos> Zhulov was in many of the same places as Christoph In the last year Christoph was known to be active.<eos> I think he was Christoph's set-up man... Opening accounts, commandeering supplies, Arranging logistics.<eos> You need to get to zhulov and talk to him.<eos> Zhulov hasn't said a word since we took him down.<eos> As I recall, he told me to screw myself forever.<eos> Because you never had any leverage over him.<eos> Now, with his connection to Christoph, you do.
Oh...! Give us your autograph now you're famous.<eos> You know this is lame, right?<eos> It's for my vlog.<eos> You are not putting this online.<eos> I'm gonna have to go soon, Dad.<eos> But Nell is coming tomorrow, so you won't be, you know... '98?<eos> No, no, not '98.<eos> April 2000.<eos> 34lb, that salmon. Do you remember?<eos> Yes, I do.
How do you want to spread the vaccine?<eos> Well, if you think about it, you were able to kill 5 billion people<eos> - simply by breathing.<eos> - I...<eos> So the key to transmission lies within you.<eos> If I could teach healthy lungs to hold and reproduce the cure the same way yours do with the virus, well, then I could...<eos> You could make the cure contagious.<eos> Of course, the trick would be understanding just how your body does it, to be able to compare the D.N.A. sequence change between yours and the primordial.<eos> You have my blood samples.<eos> I do.
I need someone to talk to.<eos> Thank God I've got a past full of lonely men to draw from. Mm-hmm.<eos> Disco Stu is over you.<eos> Oh, Disco Stu needs a Zoloft or two.<eos> Who am I kidding?<eos> The one I should be talking to is the one who's always been there for me... my cigarette.<eos> Forget about your sister.<eos> You've got me.<eos> For the rest of your life I'll be the first thing you think about every morning.<eos> And the last thing you do every night.
The famine?<eos> Ireland, 1845.<eos> The awful blight upon the potato crop?<eos> It's called An Gorta Mor.<eos> Oh. Is that, like, the name of the main guy, like Tommy?<eos> An Gorta Mor is Gaelic for "the great hunger."<eos> - You want to hear it?<eos> - Now?<eos> No, you don't want to hear it.<eos> No, no, I do.
I don't know, you call it what you want to.<eos> It was people who are recreating or are continuing the crimes committed by notorious killers from the past.<eos> March-- there was a guy.<eos> One guy called himself March, James Patrick March.<eos> You just check out the history of the hotel.<eos> That's the name of the guy who built it.<eos> And you had dinner with him.<eos> I was in a room with a guy who claimed to be him, a guy who I think is responsible for the five dead bodies on the wall in my office!<eos> You think he's The Ten Commandment Killer?<eos> I do.
And somewhere, along an endless expanse of Midwest plains, I woke from a dreamless sleep into a dream itself.<eos> It was a seduction, but mere carnality was not his aim.<eos> I was repelled and drawn in all at once.<eos> When he spoke, it was in Italian but with a thick German accent.<eos> He revealed to me his name, F.W. Murnau, the great German director.<eos> What did he want from you?<eos> I thought he meant to kill me.<eos> But instead he wished to preserve me.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Neither did I, at first.
What were we talking about?<eos> Honey, it happens all the time now.<eos> "Cassie, where my keys?<eos> Cassie, what day is it?"<eos> You talk to the doctor, Daddy?<eos> Huh? Your mama is the sick one.<eos> Only room for one in the family.<eos> Daddy, let me drive you over to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.<eos> I can drive myself if I want to go.<eos> And I don't.
You would just be doing your job.<eos> My job is to arrest them.<eos> And how does that make you feel?<eos> When you collar a man, as opposed to letting your fists be jury and judge?<eos> If it was up to me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't need a judge to tell me whether someone's guilty or not. I know.<eos> I believe you, John.<eos> If they took the leash off me, crime would drop in this city.<eos> I truly do.
Open up!<eos> Max!<eos> I told you, we should have never trusted that bitch!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Mama... smells appetizers.<eos> *** move like a teenager that's about to get caught?<eos> We're getting a divorce.<eos> We're not supposed to be sleeping together.<eos> Who says we have to go through with it?<eos> I do.
- What's up, Cat? Oh.<eos> Huh? Look at us.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All back together.<eos> - One big happy family.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> What...<eos> I come to see my little girl in the big city, huh?<eos> Holy shit, you got a tattoo there.<eos> - Yes, she did.
Holy shit, you got a tattoo there.<eos> - Yes, she did.<eos> - Oh, that's for him.<eos> That's nice. Where's mine?<eos> I should have gotten one for you; he hates his.<eos> Oh, why?<eos> Do you hate the color?<eos> He doesn't like commitment.<eos> Do you not have Gigi's name on you?<eos> No, no, actually, he doesn't.
Yeah?<eos> How does she look?<eos> - Pow. - Wow.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Look at the detail.<eos> It's just like the old ax.<eos> I know;<eos> I was trying to make an impression.<eos> Well, you would have.<eos> You did just now.
Listen, you brought it up.<eos> - I go down on a guy...<eos> - I don't want...<eos> I said... I changed the words!<eos> I go down on a guy I like to decide whether or not I want to sleep with him.<eos> Like, I'll do it, like, two or three times to keep him interested, and, you know...<eos> It's my system.<eos> Okay... you have a system?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.<eos> Every girl does.
Yeah, not exactly like...<eos> But, yeah, once or twice.<eos> So you've had to deal with people who are scared.<eos> What do you say to them?<eos> I'm asking what I should say to you.<eos> That it will be all right.<eos> That the Doctor will save us.<eos> And when you say it, do you believe it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- What?<eos> - I can't do this anymore.<eos> Okay?<eos> I can't come to work and go through this with you every single day!<eos> Gabi, you can't quit.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Well, for your information,<eos> I have an apprenticeship with the very famous<eos> Chef Charles D'Arby.<eos> You do?
I'm so sorry for the way things ended.<eos> No, Gabi, I'm sorry.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> You know, you're, like, up here.<eos> And I'm down here.<eos> And a guy down here never gets the girl up here.<eos> So when I found out Josh had feelings for you, I panicked.<eos> I thought if you found out, I'd lose you.<eos> Cooper, you don't have to tell me all this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh, in and out. Sierra, that's three for blue Sierra, that's three for blue collar.<eos> No collar simply cannot get a No collar simply cannot get a buoy in the basket. Buoy in the basket.<eos> White collar from dead last. White collar from dead last.<eos> Joaquin wins it for the white Joaquin wins it for the white collar tribe. Collar tribe.<eos> We're looking for one more.<eos> It is now blue collar and no It is now blue collar and no collar. Collar.<eos> Four nor blue collar. Four nor blue collar. No collar starting to panic now.<eos> No collar starting to panic now. No collar can't get anything No collar can't get anything going.<eos> Sierra can win it right here.<eos> She does!
United Westside African Methodist Episcopal<eos> Holy Tabernacle Church of God.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I think a couple of them merged.<eos> I can't believe you're buying into this.<eos> What is your problem with God?<eos> I don't have a problem with God.<eos> I happen to be a very spiritual person.<eos> My problem is with an ex-con looking me in the eye and telling me I lost Alvin because God has some freakin' plan.<eos> Well... maybe he does.
He have any connection to Makai?<eos> None.<eos> All right, then why does he pick Makai?<eos> The guy's been in jail for years.<eos> There are plenty of cooks on the island. Everybody starts somewhere.<eos> How do we know we're not witnessing the birth of a major player?<eos> All right, well,<eos> If Moon is the real deal, the good news is we've got a chance to crack this kid before he makes his mark on the ice trade.<eos> Find them.<eos> You done?
Over here!<eos> Hey! Over here!<eos> Come back!<eos> Come back...<eos> You want some help?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> You're getting really good, Kono.<eos> A year from now, you'll be paddling out at Pipeline.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do.
MARJORIE: Really?<eos> You talk and you share?<eos> You let your true self be seen?<eos> I have a true self?<eos> Intimacy, Christy.<eos> Break it down.<eos> "Into-me-see."<eos> You say that kind of crap to Jamal?<eos> I was a heroin addict back then.<eos> I didn't do that much talking.
Well, at least I did until you started working here.<eos> Whatever.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I actually really need to talk to someone about something that you're kind of an expert in.<eos> - Real estate?<eos> - No.<eos> One-night stands.<eos> I had my first one last night. Ha ha ha ha! Oh, man!<eos> I remember my first one-night stand.<eos> No, I don't.
When I'm not with the nuns.<eos> You cleaned my wound.<eos> Stitched it myself.<eos> You're lucky that blade stuck you where it did.<eos> A few inches difference...<eos> Well, even my gift has its limits.<eos> Was it your gift... or your medicine that healed me?<eos> I saved your life.<eos> Does it matter that much to you how?<eos> Yes, it does.
I think he shoved Morris down and he shot him in the back of the head, and can I prove that?<eos> No, not without the head.<eos> - All right.<eos> - You all may be seated.<eos> Mr. Lewis, you may proceed.<eos> This case is not about what happened to Morris Black's body after he was dead.<eos> This case is not about what Bob Durst did after Morris Black died.<eos> The sole issue for you ladies and gentlemen to decide is how Morris Black died.<eos> We started getting over to the jurors this thought about, "It doesn't change what happened<eos> "to Morris Black, anything that Bob Durst did with the body afterwards."
No, no, this is, uh... this is better, actually.<eos> We're not gonna be working in the bunker, so... Uh-huh. What is this about, again?<eos> You were kind of... vague.<eos> Okay, so, here's the thing...<eos> Dean is not getting any better.<eos> I feel like if we don't get the Mark off his arm, it's gonna eat him up.<eos> I get it, but what are we gonna do about it?<eos> I got ahold of a codex which is sort of a-a collection of supernatural code-breaking tools, and it should help crack "The Book of the Damned."<eos> That would be awesome if the book, you know, actually existed.<eos> It does.
Less talk, more translating.<eos> Go.<eos> About that -- I said I can read the book, I never said I would.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Oh, we did, we do, and it's time you held up your end.<eos> I want my son... Dead.<eos> After -- Now.<eos> Once I cast the spell -- and you need me to cast that spell -- who knows what will happen?<eos> I don't have time for this!<eos> Right, you don't.
You tell that ginger whore that I gave her a chance to walk away, and she spat in my face.<eos> So, now... She'll never see me coming.<eos> Ah, morning', Sunshine.<eos> Monroe Styne.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> Ditto.<eos> I'd shake your hand, but, uh... Hmm. Well, I have to say I am impressed the way you charged in here all guns blazin'.<eos> I'd buy tickets to that show.<eos> You didn't think that was really gonna work, did you?<eos> Usually does.
Oh, you are like them.<eos> There's bad in you.<eos> It's in your blood.<eos> Now, you can deny it, and you can run from it all you want, but that bad will always win.<eos> I'll do anything you want, okay?<eos> Please.<eos> You don't need to do this.<eos> Please.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
We all are.<eos> Poor Dean.<eos> Let's just have a nice wee cup of tea... and negotiate.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Oh, well, we know what I wanted.<eos> Soiled the sheets on that one, didn't we?<eos> Let's talk about what I'll take -- my freedom guaranteed and the codex.<eos> Sam, you can't be --<eos> Do you know which spell?<eos> I do.
But now I think that maybe it has more to do with me being a Banshee.<eos> It's not my memory, Stiles.<eos> It's someone else's.<eos> Why haven't you said anything?<eos> About what?<eos> The rest of my memory.<eos> The Desert Wolf.<eos> Why didn't you tell Scott?<eos> I didn't think you wanted me to.<eos> I don't.
It's the fire you started in the third ward last night.<eos> Man, I didn't start no fire there last night.<eos> What?<eos> Were you out of town?<eos> Your cat get sick?<eos> Well, let me guess.<eos> You don't start fires anymore.<eos> You been rehabilitated.<eos> Yeah, I done it before. So what?<eos> I didn't do this one.
What is this?<eos> Agent Keen just closed one of her accounts.<eos> She moved all the money to an offshore account an hour ago.<eos> It's not illegal to close an account, Detective.<eos> What's illegal is monitoring her financials<eos> - without a warrant.<eos> - Please.<eos> Main Justice wants to shut down our murder investigation<eos> - and we have to play by the rules?<eos> - Yes, we do.
You're looking for Cristela?<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm her boss, Trent Culpepper.<eos> Oh!<eos> Mr. Culpepper.<eos> Ha.<eos> This is my mother...<eos> Natalia.<eos> She doesn't speak English.<eos> I do, too.
I-I'm not looking for Mr. Right.<eos> I like drinking beer and watching football while wearing pants with an elastic band.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I should brag about that.<eos> Everybody, gather 'round.<eos> This is my daughter.<eos> She's my son.<eos> You know, Cris, it isn't all ama's fault.<eos> You want her to say how great you are, but I'm not sure you know it.<eos> Yes, I do.
I want the surgery!<eos> Dr. Karev is gonna drain the fluid,<eos> - and you're gonna feel better.<eos> - No! I won't!<eos> I can't keep doing this.<eos> I want the surgery.<eos> It's really risky.<eos> Your body's very weak.<eos> - You don't know what you're saying.<eos> - Yes, I do!
I'm sorry it ended.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Any word on the kid?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Still in the O.R.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just need something good to come out of this day.<eos> Abdominal injuries are under control.<eos> I'm ready to close.<eos> You about done, Kepner?
She was just right here, wasn't she?<eos> Julie?<eos> Hey, don't worry.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> We'll find her, ma'am.<eos> I know this is a difficult time and it's the last thing you'd want to think about, but you do have a decision to make.<eos> Do you know if your sons would have considered becoming organ donors?<eos> They were always helping people, even as little boys.<eos> That's why they wanted to be policemen.<eos> Well, Brett did.
Are those spiders all over your body?<eos> Hmm. Look at that.<eos> I won.<eos> Poor guy was so scared that he died of a heart attack.<eos> No.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> Technically, he died of a loophole.<eos> A win is a win.<eos> - So you know what we do now.<eos> - Yes, unfortunately, I do.
You can't.<eos> I've already had consumption.<eos> - How did you survive?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> What are you, an angel?<eos> Ha ha ha! We listened to you sing, we clapped our hands.<eos> Can we go now?<eos> Let's play Caroline trivia.<eos> I don't even know what that is.<eos> Oh, sure you do!
Thank you.<eos> - Talk tomorrow.<eos> - Hello. - Hello. Who is this?<eos> He works at the headquarters of the Russians.<eos> Service custody?<eos> No...<eos> Custody Service agreed that Peter Stay with her mother for some time.<eos> It is still not for the fact that he spit in my future.<eos> - He just drifting, eh?<eos> - What does Peter?
What use is finding the car now?<eos> It was stolen.<eos> It can't identify anyone, there'll be no traceable link.<eos> I don't know...<eos> But right now we've got bugger all else.<eos> Sorry, mate.<eos> 775 UCC.<eos> You have it?<eos> Er, no.<eos> We did.
As I say. I...<eos> I can't really remember an awful lot about it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yeah, my real name's Alan Mackay, but everyone calls me Mackie.<eos> Well, thanks so much for getting in touch.<eos> And just so I can be absolutely clear, as well as Jimmy, I think you said you knew Vincent Erskine as well.<eos> Vince? Yeah.<eos> And Beth, his girlfriend.<eos> - You knew Elizabeth?<eos> - 'I did, aye.'
She was there, like, you know, in the background, but er... not actually part of the conversation.<eos> And so what did you say?<eos> Well... I didn't say much, because I didn't want him to know that er... that Jimmy was actually a good friend of mine.<eos> You know, and obviously I was gonna warn him.<eos> - And did you warn him?<eos> - I went to look for him but er...<eos> Somebody offered me some gear.<eos> By the time I was straight again it was two days later.<eos> And sir, did you find out if he'd been robbed?<eos> No, I didn't.
I'll be very quick.<eos> I just thought you had a right to know.<eos> I had to go down to the police station last night and tell them it was Robert who stole the money from the community hall safe.<eos> He admitted it to me yesterday.<eos> And also that he'd been stealing from the church for quite some time.<eos> And you.<eos> He told me he'd stolen some of your jewellery.<eos> He wouldn't tell me why.<eos> Oh, he needs help, Grace.<eos> He really does.
We found the same things funny.<eos> Always had plenty to talk about and one day, she just asked me out.<eos> A bit unconventional, but I didn't mind.<eos> Our first date was at the Locarno, in Queen's Park.<eos> We kissed outside and I bought us saveloy and chips from a takeaway in Townmead Road.<eos> Yeah, we courted for, er, a year or so and then got married, before we moved to Dollis Hill.<eos> That's where I got the job at, er, Arlingham House which was, er, which was round the corner.<eos> 1971, er, that was.<eos> Yes, she-she wanted kids im-immediately because, you know, we were neither of us spring chickens.<eos> Which, I did too, very much.
I don't think that he did it, but Morten has a brother.<eos> That's what I mean.<eos> - Elias is his half-brother.<eos> - I know that, Wiki.<eos> Sometimes people call their half-siblings their siblings, do they not?<eos> So maybe Morten has more half-siblings.<eos> Why didn't you say that straight away?<eos> I had to convince you that I didn't believe a four-year-old had shot two people in two countries.<eos> - It sounded as if that was what you thought.<eos> - Oh, did it, Saga?
- Okay. Where's your hotel?<eos> Our model home is completely furnished.<eos> Think if we could always have it be this way.<eos> - We can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I love you.<eos> But now that's how it is.<eos> - I hate it.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you don't.
Colbert. Colbert.<eos> Just do what we've agreed.<eos> - You seem to have it good.<eos> - I do.<eos> Are you Claes Sandberg?<eos> Can you come with me?<eos> Yeah. Did something happen? No.<eos> Hi, Claes.<eos> - Do you know her?<eos> - Yes, I do.
You think that some of the murders are inspired by the titles of the artwork.<eos> Yes.<eos> Every crime in the world could be named after works of art.<eos> If you have a dead person who has a little smile on you could call that 'Mona Lisa'.<eos> - Sure, it ...<eos> - In principle, you could do that.<eos> Thanks so much for coming.<eos> It's always good to get some tips.<eos> - Do the pieces have anything in common?<eos> - No, they don't.
- Was someone living down here?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> If they also have symbols in their mouths, there's only one symbol left in the code.<eos> It could suggest that there's only one victim left.<eos> I'm thinking Freddie Holst.<eos> Why point to Holst if he's the next victim?<eos> I don't know. To scare him, maybe.<eos> I didn't see Alice and the girls this morning.<eos> - Should you have?<eos> - I usually do.
- That's Linn's job. Ask her.<eos> - Emil Larsson ...<eos> There's an Emil Larsson who was fired.<eos> Is it that Emil Larsson?<eos> - Who?<eos> - The museum guard.<eos> The one who tipped us off about the connection between Holst and the pictures.<eos> I don't know. Does he work at Andersen TL?<eos> There is, in any case, someone with that name who does.<eos> Did.
You tell me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to start training.<eos> I want to heal up and fight again.<eos> Long term, what do you want?<eos> You ever think about getting married, having a family?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> You're 23. How do you know?<eos> I just do.
With you ASAP.<eos> Rest of you OK?<eos> I've sustained mild injuries but I'm fine.<eos> Quite lucky, actually.<eos> Such tenderness, such care.<eos> All right, Mac.<eos> I fucked him once, ages ago when we were drunk and we said we'd never speak of it again.<eos> How's that going?<eos> I don't even fancy him.<eos> I don't!
- I didn't want anything really big.<eos> - This is really good.<eos> What do you think this is?<eos> A vacation?<eos> You are all useless.<eos> All right, bitches, on the line!<eos> Get on the line right now!<eos> That's better.<eos> I happen to know that none of my DPB sisters or brothers at Kappa Tau Pi are gonna want anything to do with any of you if you all suck.<eos> And right now, you do.
No!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This is really starting to get disgusting.<eos> God! God!<eos> I'm all right. I'm all right.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Okay.<eos> God, that's disgusting.<eos> When my lawyers are through with you, you'll wish you never met me.<eos> I already do.
Uh, no, thanks, honey.<eos> I-I think I'm gonna skip breakfast this morning.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Don't listen to Vince.<eos> If he's not saying something dumb, he's saying something stupid.<eos> No, it's not him.<eos> I just don't feel like eating, okay?<eos> Fine.<eos> You don't know what you're missing. (hesitantly): Mmm...<eos> You really don't.
WOMAN: Number 42!<eos> Right here.<eos> You had to have lunch in Chinatown, didn't you?<eos> It smells so good I could go Godzilla on the whole neighborhood.<eos> But I'm gonna let that go 'cause I like the imagery.<eos> (inhales deeply) Four dollars for all of this.<eos> I mean, even if the chicken is pigeon, you can't beat that price.<eos> Sure you don't want any?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Of course I do.
He's not worth it.<eos> Just go home.<eos> I got to get changed first.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine, Carl.<eos> All right.<eos> You just keep your mouth shut.<eos> Well, tell that to your partner.<eos> 'Cause I think that's his problem.<eos> Now, now who has a problem?<eos> You do, man!
Really?<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> Oh, no occasion.<eos> It was actually the captain's idea.<eos> So he's just handing out days off now?<eos> Guess he was in a good mood.<eos> He said take tomorrow off and the next day and...<eos> Three days, tops.<eos> Mike, I know what's really going on.<eos> You do?
Follow up with comedy.<eos> And number trey, your home run, your triple...<eos> Have great looks.<eos> I got 'em, and I passed them on to you.<eos> So get out there, you beautiful peacock.<eos> Shake your tail feathers.<eos> I mean, I'd rather not get these compliments with my pants down, but appreciate it.<eos> Paul, you don't have to do this if you don't want to.<eos> You don't have to clown for these people.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Quick errand.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You still suck.<eos> I'm not a good friend, really?<eos> - What the hell is that?<eos> - Eminem tickets.<eos> I took you to that concert for your 17th birthday.<eos> You remember?<eos> And I hated Eminem.<eos> You did not.
It was Earl's.<eos> Then it's genius.<eos> Yep, I've been drinking all afternoon for free.<eos> Now, I've used only top shelf liquor.<eos> Question: Who got it down for you?<eos> First up: "The Max".<eos> It's just whiskey.<eos> On the rocks, like Max's job.<eos> Whatever mine is, I want my rim salted.<eos> Of course you do.
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.<eos> Could anything be more wonderful? [laughs] Max, I can't believe you did all this.<eos> I thought you came home to do what you usually do when you get depressed.<eos> Get drunk and throw the finger at people from the stoop.<eos> No stoop.<eos> But I am drunk.<eos> You think I could've done this sober?<eos> I just figured, with everything around us being so black lately, I thought we needed a little pink.<eos> You're right.<eos> We did.
Stand still Prospect.<eos> Hold still.<eos> This one, is coming right... down... the middle.<eos> Shit.<eos> The thing's out of gas.<eos> You want a beer?<eos> Whoa, wait!<eos> Who says we're done here?<eos> Come on Stash.<eos> I do.
Hi, Chloé.<eos> You remember me?<eos> Stay away from her.<eos> You're waiting for the bride, this time?<eos> – If you touch Adèle...<eos> – Shut up.<eos> – You've ruined her life.<eos> You've made her miserable.<eos> I love her.<eos> No, you don't.
Dearies.<eos> Go.<eos> I got the Dark One.<eos> "Dark One"?<eos> I'm afraid you have the wrong name, dearie.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Regina, go!<eos> Bishop: Let all who have gathered here...<eos> Do you, Zelena, take Robin to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.
Arthur. You have my deepest condolences.<eos> Thank you, Willie.<eos> Good shot.<eos> Thank you, Edna.<eos> ~ Kingsley?<eos> ~ Coming.<eos> ~ Father?<eos> ~ Yes, Mary.<eos> When Mother was dying, she said you would remarry.<eos> Did she by God?
George Edalji takes a smaller size?<eos> A nine.<eos> In other words, Woodie... in other words, gentlemen of the jury, despite the commonality of the bulked right heel, George Edalji did not leave those prints, but rather someone trying very hard to make us think he did.<eos> Why are you looking dubious, gentlemen of the jury?<eos> I'm just listening, Sir Arthur.<eos> You're not, you're looking dubious.<eos> I know dubiety when I see it.<eos> ~ Raise your objection.<eos> ~ I have no objection.<eos> Yes, you do.
He's up there.<eos> Woodie!<eos> (GROANS) Bastard!<eos> ~ Thank you, Woodie.<eos> ~ Not at all, sir.<eos> What?<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You want to know why? (LAUGHS)<eos> Do you really need to ask?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
I found a perfect spot.<eos> Can get a great deal on the lease.<eos> Look, there's no way we can cover the overhead.<eos> There's computers, furniture, travel, your fucking bar tabs.<eos> Joe, I've got next to nothing in the bank.<eos> Zero seed money.<eos> - I got some socked away. - Enough to launch a company?<eos> Enough to convince a bank to lend us the balance.<eos> Do you know how to run an entire company?<eos> 'Cause I sure as fuck don't.
Thanks.<eos> So, what's the word?<eos> Turns out our victim, Ken Leung, is the deputy leader of the golden tiger triad.<eos> He's been promoted.<eos> Oh, so you know him.<eos> We've crossed paths.<eos> Gang Squad tell you his brother, George, is in charge of west coast operations?<eos> Yes, they did, only they referred to him as "Mountain Master."<eos> - Because they like to show-off.<eos> - Yeah, they do.
Did he say how he screwed up?<eos> I assumed it had something to do with work. I was surprised he even called me.<eos> That's not a common occurrence.<eos> We didn't have much to say to each other.<eos> I lost my daughter because of him. She's with a foster family now.<eos> I'm sorry, that must have been very hard on you.<eos> I didn't kill Ken.<eos> I'm angry. I'm not stupid.<eos> You know who his brother is, right?<eos> We do.
Burn out?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> Can you tell me if he had any dealings with Andrew Gorman or Ronald Hanlon?<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> Teri Leung?<eos> I can't give you any information without a warrant, Detective.<eos> Well, you see, the information you have could help me solve a homicide, and that sounds like a social service to me, so...<eos> Come back with a warrant.<eos> You're a cop, you know how this works.<eos> Yes, I do. I do, right.
Is this the social worker that you accompanied?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Did you extract a child from this woman?<eos> He did.<eos> Great.<eos> Angie, I've got your confirmation.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I do.
Angie, I've got your confirmation.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I do.<eos> So, you know why I'm here.<eos> I'm guessing because...<eos> Teri sold me out.<eos> Did you know the three cardinal tiles in mahjong represent the three cardinal virtues of Confucius.<eos> Of course I do.
Sir?<eos> Something is different from when I was last here.<eos> What?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know. Henry, please fetch my camera.<eos> Right away.<eos> You're not a policeman anymore so stop behaving like one.<eos> That man who was killed, he's somehow connected to a woman by the name of Edna Brooks.<eos> - Yes, I know who she is.<eos> - You do?
Or retrieving it.<eos> I knew there was a reason I married you. (Murdoch laughing)<eos> (guard): Alright, stand in the yard!<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> I need to see that body before it's disposed of.<eos> Just wait a moment.<eos> You know something?<eos> He said your mother<eos> - was a prostitute.<eos> - He did, did he?
More than any man would.<eos> You were prepared to give them your life.<eos> And now you have yours back.<eos> When do you leave?<eos> Dr. Ogden told me you were going to England.<eos> Three weeks and a day.<eos> You're counting down.<eos> It's a good sign.<eos> Means you want to go.<eos> I do.
- Hey, Christopher.<eos> - Oh, who's that guy?<eos> - That's Glow Nose.<eos> Glow Nose.<eos> Okay.<eos> - He was my...<eos> No, he was Jake's...<eos> - He was my when he was a little kid, and then he was Sally's, and now he's mine.<eos> - He looks like he's had a lot of love.<eos> - Yes, he does.
- Anyone can drive stick.<eos> There's a whole package of cookies here, so...<eos> - pick a different papa.<eos> - Yeah, pick a different one.<eos> Yeah, Sal, there's a whole pack of cookies.<eos> Yep, look at all of these...<eos> Jacob!<eos> - So many cookies.<eos> - Anna!<eos> Do something!
Mom.<eos> Get in the damn car.<eos> She's already out.<eos> Bet she's gonna wake up With a hell of a hangover in the morning.<eos> Can't say i feel too bad about that.<eos> You know she didn't mean it, right?<eos> She was just using her teenage superpower Of instantly knowing the most horrible thing to say.<eos> What bothers me is that she snuck out, late at night.<eos> Something terrible could've happened.<eos> But nothing did.
I didn't think so.<eos> He killed those girls just as sure as he killed my partner.<eos> Too bad they can't hang him twice.<eos> They didn't tell me you were here.<eos> I came straight from school, just like you asked.<eos> Mom -<eos> You don't have to apologize again.<eos> I really am sorry.<eos> I am so sorry. I don't know what got into me.<eos> I do.
Guess who was the last person to see laurel ayers alive.<eos> Her manager at the taco place?<eos> I asked the guys in homicide If i could take a look at her case file.<eos> Turns out when laurel disappeared, The manager was questioned and cleared.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, but young girls run away all the time.<eos> Problems at home, they take off.<eos> You know what i mean?<eos> Yeah, i do.
Because being first lady, Cyrus, is an act of patriotism.<eos> It is a long-standing tradition.<eos> Exactly... a tradition, not a law of the land.<eos> No one should be able to tell any woman she cannot hold a job, Sally.<eos> It's sexism of the purist and ugliest form.<eos> But Mrs. Grant has a job.<eos> Being a mother is the hardest job in the world, and she...<eos> You know...<eos> I know people love to say that.<eos> I do.
There are rules, regulations, protocols.<eos> You don't just pop onto a U.S. Navy vessel.<eos> Understood, of course.<eos> I was just here picking my client up to bring her back to my office for a meeting.<eos> I don't think that'll be possible.<eos> Ensign Martin is integral to our operation, and she has some duties she's neglecting at the moment.<eos> Back to work.<eos> It's better if he's not too damaged.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> I do.
Until she starts to believe he's gone.<eos> And she relaxes.<eos> And then he sends us in.<eos> But she has to know.<eos> That's how he lets her know Papa Pope is in charge.<eos> That's how he lets her know that...<eos> You can't take command, son.<eos> Yes.<eos> She never had a chance, did she?<eos> No, she didn't.
For something called "conduct unbecoming." Whatever that means.<eos> According to the uniform code of military justice, that could mean any number of things... making a rude remark, using foul language...<eos> Sneezing at the wrong time.<eos> There has to be some way we can get Amy out of there.<eos> What about emergency medical leave?<eos> Sure, if Amy had a dead relative whose funeral she had to attend, for example.<eos> What about a sick relative?<eos> One she had to leave the ship to visit?<eos> That works, too, but Amy doesn't have a sick relative.<eos> Actually, she does.

She's a housewife from Minnesota.<eos> When her daughter was prescribed Adderall,<eos> Betsey turned to the medicine cabinet to solve her troubles.<eos> I ended up, you know, taking one, and then taking two, and then taking all of them, and then I just started telling her that she didn't have ADHD and took it all from her.<eos> Yup, I took it from my daughter.<eos> When my daughter did take it... This is how I justified it...<eos> When she did take it, She might have been able to focus more in school, but it took the joy from her, so I kind of felt like...<eos> I justified it, like, well, it really isn't good for her.<eos> And every time I'd get it refilled, I'd say, "I'm not going to do it this time," you know?<eos> And I always did.
- Ever break your rule?<eos> Couple of times.<eos> Couple of times in two years?<eos> - More or less.<eos> - More?<eos> Or less.<eos> Last time we talked, You said that, uh, were seeing someone.<eos> - I was.<eos> - You said you liked her.<eos> I still do.
Don't worry.<eos> You won't find any surprises.<eos> Not like, um, "turn on the TV to discover<eos> "your husband's hiding some global mystery about his best friend's identity from you" surprises.<eos> I... I, uh...<eos> - That threw me, too.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> So you didn't know she was Amanda Clarke?<eos> No.<eos> No, I did.
You know, I just keep thinking, you know, if we all showed up, what's to say other people won't show up?<eos> Relax, nobody else is gonna show up.<eos> Well, how can you be so sure?<eos> Because I am.<eos> Look, I'm finally single again.<eos> I-I'm friends with my ex, and I have two dates lined up, one of which is a straight-up sex date.<eos> I'm about 69 percent sure of that.<eos> I have even more to lose than you.<eos> And do I look nervous about it?<eos> No, you don't.
- You all need to get a hobby.<eos> - I've got a hobby, thanks.<eos> It's you, by the way.<eos> Well, get a new one.<eos> - Not this.<eos> - Tomorrow it's going to be a bloodbath... - Don't even ask!<eos> These people died hundreds of years before you were born...<eos> - I'm not running!<eos> - I have a duty of care.<eos> - No, you don't.
You used mine.<eos> No, please. Michelle.<eos> Back, back!<eos> This whole time, that's what this was about.<eos> You got close to me so you can use me!<eos> No, no.<eos> No, this is real.<eos> Everything about you is real to me.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> I do.
Jenna, believe in love!<eos> Come on, Jenna, you're always complaining about what a [bleep] inconvenience it is to have Matty McKibben in love with you, so why don't you just go and shut it down?<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> Matty, you were right.<eos> I only hooked up with Collin because he was everything you weren't, including an [bleep].<eos> Jenna, listen.<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> No, you don't.
Actually, uh, she doesn't know.<eos> - Gordon... - Look, you have no idea what the last year has been like.<eos> I mean, you know, her work's taking off, you know, and it's driving her, you know, like... well, like mine used to, you know?<eos> She's happy, okay?<eos> She's energized.<eos> And she'd stop everything to take care of me and I can't ask her to do that.<eos> Not... not yet, at least.<eos> So, um, if we had to switch back to XTs, how long would that take?<eos> We're not gonna have to do it.<eos> Okay, but just in case we do,
Heard you got rich, so big tip.<eos> What the hell was that about?<eos> - You're asking me? - Yeah.<eos> She lost it.<eos> Now we're dead.<eos> All Donna did was behave like you do every day without bailing you out for it like usual.<eos> - You know, maybe you didn't like it...<eos> - I never because it was like looking in a damn mirror!<eos> People have other things going on in their lives that you don't know about.<eos> And you do, huh?
There's a lot of people out there who think I killed my wife, that I killed Susan Berman, that I intentionally murdered Morris Black.<eos> "And it's quite possible that he's killed a whole slew of other people."<eos> That is what I would think if I was as familiar with the media as I am about me.<eos> Hello.<eos> Oh, Nicky!<eos> How are you?<eos> Can I have a name for the drink?<eos> Bob.<eos> And you got a tall Americano, right?<eos> - Yes, we do.
Yeah, we do.<eos> But then who would watch over Haven?<eos> And... let's be fair... I'm a much faster runner.<eos> No.<eos> It's about time.<eos> Better late than never.<eos> Miss me?<eos> All the 3s have been played. Mm-hmm.<eos> Question is, do you have a heart?<eos> Hm, of course you do.
Nathan?<eos> Lisa, Nathan's coming.<eos> We're gonna end the Troubles, I promise.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Things are gonna get better for you.<eos> I want you to tell your little brother he's got one hell of an arm.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Hailie, you have to keep it open.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I'm a reporter.<eos> For the Chronicle.<eos> Short stories and novels, too.<eos> Name is Boz.<eos> - Didn't get yours though.<eos> - I didn't give it.<eos> We seem always to be running into each other, don't we?<eos> Are you with the Herald?<eos> I think you know very well who I am.<eos> I do.
- culinarily*** speaking.<eos> - I will tell her.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Actually, I should probably thank you.<eos> Nick's helping Anthony work out to get ready for the run. He said it was your idea.<eos> - Me?<eos> - I know he's doing it mostly just to get out of being grounded and get out of the house at night.<eos> - At night?<eos> - Anthony has a band after school.<eos> - He does?
What... wait, really?<eos> I feel some scar tissue.<eos> - You may have plantar fasciitis.<eos> - Oh dear!<eos> Oh, it's nothing serious, but any pressure to your foot can cause a flare up.<eos> Just to play it safe, I think you should sit this one out.<eos> Well, if you insist!<eos> Uh, I do.<eos> As long as you know that I could've finished the race had I run.<eos> - Oh, I do.
That's my daughter on the right.<eos> And that's Ashley standing next to her.<eos> Well... her real name's Heather.<eos> And, uh, she is my granddaughter.<eos> And I can see the family resemblance.<eos> So you knew?<eos> That you and Heather connected, yes, I had a feeling.<eos> But she doesn't know you.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, she doesn't.
- Right. And no one has said anything about you and Ryan dating, that's funny huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah, we've been, you know, keeping it kind of quiet. Yep.<eos> - Okay, look,<eos> I know Ryan, we almost got married, and he's good at a lot of things, but lying is not one of them.<eos> You two aren't really dating, are you?<eos> I know I'm right, I do! And, and...<eos> I know why Ryan would lie, but what I don't get is why you would go along with it.<eos> I just have to ask, why do you care so much who Ryan does or doesn't date?<eos> I... don't care.<eos> No, you do.
- My cell was stolen.<eos> I have a new number.<eos> I'll give it to you.<eos> I've just been so busy with work.<eos> - The ad agency in New York?<eos> - Yeah. - Did I tell you that?<eos> - You didn't need to.<eos> Right.<eos> You had a feeling.<eos> I did and I do, all the time.
My advice:<eos> loosen your grip a little bit.<eos> - I can't. - No, you just don't want to.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Because I'm the only one left with a grip on her.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just know how upset Grace has been since Jake died.<eos> You do?<eos> We all have our gifts.<eos> We do.
No, I can't.<eos> Because I'm the only one left with a grip on her.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just know how upset Grace has been since Jake died.<eos> You do?<eos> We all have our gifts.<eos> We do.<eos> I feel very connected to Grace in a way that maybe you...<eos> Abigail, I know you mean well...<eos> I do.
- Hey. I'm looking for...<eos> - Sam?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah, you're late.<eos> She didn't want to wait anymore.<eos> She left you a note.<eos> It's, uh, not good.<eos> This project could be very good for the town.<eos> But you not talking about it is almost worse than you talking about it.<eos> I don't.
If he let me do what I wanted to do in the first place, I wouldn't have to.<eos> Well, thanks.<eos> You did a really nice thing tonight.<eos> In the future, be more careful. Okay?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> There are rule followers and rule breakers.<eos> You're the first, not the second.<eos> I won't always be here to help.<eos> I don't need you to be.<eos> You did tonight.
Oh, you have a sense something's brewing?<eos> Changes in the barometric pressure, wind direction, humidity, all affect our bodies, our nervous systems, our endocrine systems, our cardiovascular systems.<eos> That's more than just a sense, it's a warning.<eos> There is a 90% probability the storm's going to miss Middleton.<eos> That's a fact backed up by the national weather service.<eos> Well, "luck favors the prepared".<eos> - Louis Pasteur.<eos> - Father of microbiology.<eos> You do have an eclectic reading list, don't you?<eos> I do.
An original essay with pictures, a day in the life of one of your parents.<eos> Well, thank you for being a proxy parent.<eos> I'm sure Cassie would have loved to have you at the shop.<eos> I need to be with you today.<eos> I hope I give you enough to write about.<eos> Being a cop in Middleton can be a pretty uneventful.<eos> I just don't want to let you down.<eos> You won't.<eos> And hey, you never know what'll happen, right?<eos> No, you don't!
- Canceled what?<eos> - Her reservation.<eos> - She made a reservation here?<eos> - I run a bed and breakfast. My ex wouldn't stay at a place like this.<eos> - No offense.<eos> - She was looking forward to it.<eos> Was she?<eos> You two chatted?<eos> We did. She has a really good sense of humor.<eos> - No, she doesn't.

- That's why he has such a bad stomach.<eos> It's true.<eos> I guess I need to learn to relax.<eos> - You do.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> Doctor's orders in fact.<eos> I don't know that being on the road is such a good idea.<eos> I think you two should check back into Grey House, give me a chance to get Eve in the office tomorrow,<eos> - Well, if you think that's best.<eos> I do.
She strikes me as a person who always has a reason for everything she does.<eos> Find out the reason and you may find a solution to your problem.<eos> She's normally so punctual.<eos> - Could be traffic.<eos> - Well... I guess I do have some big news.<eos> I told you.<eos> I told him.<eos> Apparently she told me.<eos> - We want to help.<eos> - We do.
But he won't budge.<eos> Seems he's got big plans for your shop that don't include you.<eos> It's hard to believe Ryan's involved.<eos> - Yeah, Jones is the buyer... you didn't know?<eos> Ryan's Jones?<eos> Yeah.<eos> One and the same.<eos> - He didn't tell you? - No, he didn't.<eos> Oh... I'm sorry, Cassie, but you should know.<eos> Yeah, now I do.
Ok, so I'm a little off my game, alright?<eos> Only if you're trying to get the ball in the hoop.<eos> I hate this.<eos> Basketball?<eos> My parents.<eos> I'm stuck between them and they really hate each other.<eos> Dad wants me to stay here, and Mom wants me to go with her.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> I want to go to Hong Kong and back to New York.<eos> No, you don't.

The scroll...<eos> I counted the cost of a prolonged fight with your mother, and the price is just too high for you to pay.<eos> All I've ever wanted was for you to be happy.<eos> So, that's why you aren't fighting Mom?<eos> That's... Why I do everything.<eos> Nick, I...<eos> I love you.<eos> And I want things to go smoothly for you with your mother and Geoffrey.<eos> - You don't have to go.<eos> - I do.

- Good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you, too. How's it going?<eos> Everything is good.<eos> This is one of your biggest fans, Dan Balsamo.<eos> Dan, what's going on, man?<eos> Great to meet you.<eos> Good to meet you.<eos> All right, and this is the big man right here.<eos> What's up, little man?<eos> - How you doing?
This is St. Nicholas we're talking about?<eos> As in Kris Kringle?<eos> He means something more in Orthodox tradition.<eos> He's the one you turn to in cases of calamity, when things have turned against you.<eos> It's just an observation, but he seemed like a different person, like he was afraid, even.<eos> Afraid of what?<eos> I don't know, but I've been around enough true believers to know when they're really praying, and Ostrov was.<eos> The guy that took me hunting this afternoon was confident, secure, like everything was going his way.<eos> Could something have happened to change that?<eos> Yeah, as a matter of fact, something did.
We tell the Russians we're going down to get those men out, they will refuse.<eos> And they're close enough now to send out a missile of their own, and destroy it themselves before we'll get a chance to touch it.<eos> So, no good options.<eos> Ostrov will never admit failure, concede that one of his crews mutinied.<eos> Not in public.<eos> There may be a way to resolve this.<eos> A deal that even he can live with.<eos> But we're gonna need to go through back channels.<eos> And we happen to have one.<eos> We do.
Code name for the vice president is Elvis.<eos> Last known location of Elvis was here...<eos> Graceland.<eos> We're to jump in, secure Elvis, and helo out of the city as quickly as possible.<eos> There's a high school football field a half klick to the east.<eos> That's where we'll jump in.<eos> If we're on the go, we should reach the target in under six minutes.<eos> The bird will be on station, so we shouldn't be on the ground more than 30 minutes.<eos> Sir, do you know if the package is still there?<eos> No, we do not.
Thank you, Mr Waterhouse.<eos> Tell us more of this arse kissing.<eos> How close did you spy it?<eos> Was it right on the hole or just on the cheek? Er... Mr Waterhouse, I take it you are known to Elizabeth Gadge, is that right?<eos> I suppose.<eos> In what capacity?<eos> We did have dealings in livestock.<eos> She did sell a cow to me of late.<eos> And after a short time I surmise this cow did die, did it not?<eos> Yes, it bloody well did.
You're here.<eos> Yeah, I'm here in my own home.<eos> Crazy world, huh?<eos> Hey, Cammy.<eos> What, uh... what do you have there?<eos> Karaoke machine?<eos> Where?<eos> In the box that says "Karaoke Machine" on it.<eos> Oh.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
That's a compromise I can live with.<eos> Well, I'm not giving up my source, and I won't give up my files.<eos> They're not your files. They belong to the company.<eos> What about journalistic principles?<eos> Consider the greater good, Stacey.<eos> Detective Brian Lucas, hello.<eos> I've heard great things about you from my friends in financial crime.<eos> You too, sergeant. You're a legend.<eos> So, you, uh, you like homicide?<eos> I do, very much.
- Okay.<eos> And when it's bad, it hurts so much.<eos> Hey, can we talk?<eos> Uh, actually, I was just...<eos> What's really going on?<eos> I need you to tell me, 'cause...<eos> You say one thing, and I think you mean something else entirely, and I want to understand.<eos> I am trying to.<eos> Because I want what we started here.<eos> I do.
It's a chance to start living honestly.<eos> Well, you were always better at that than me.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But now that this is over, there's nothing stopping you.<eos> Almost over.<eos> Victoria still has the drive with the evidence on me.<eos> She hasn't made a move yet, which means she's planning something.<eos> I have Nolan tracking it.<eos> Well, you guys will figure something out.<eos> You always do.
I told her how I felt.<eos> She made it clear she didn't want to be with me.<eos> Look, it's time I faced reality.<eos> She never wanted me to be a part of this, anyway.<eos> Only because she was protecting you.<eos> She loves you, Jack.<eos> I can't hear that right now.<eos> And I certainly didn't hear it from her.<eos> We both know that what Emily says and what Emily feels are two very different things.<eos> Yes, we do.
Oh, they're too clever to fall for that.<eos> But they will make a mistake, and we will be there to catch them.<eos> We?<eos> I can get past our history... If you can... For Victoria.<eos> I hope she's all right tonight.<eos> You missed your flight.<eos> Seeing that look on your face almost makes the past year worthwhile, the key word being "almost."<eos> What are you doing here, Mason?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Yes, we did.
One "won't scratch my junk in front of company."<eos> Really?<eos> - Happy mother's day.<eos> - Happy mother's day!<eos> Well, at least your kids are creative.<eos> I raised you to be practical, so I guess that's why I got a practical gift.<eos> [Sighs] Mom... [voice breaking] It's just that my mom was so flaky and all over the place that I guess I went in the opposite direction with you, and somehow apparently ended up crushing your dreams.<eos> Mom, don't cry.<eos> I still have some dreams.<eos> No, you don't.
I don't want to know what Ric's doing, do I?<eos> Probably at the movies.<eos> Yeah, or--or mini golf.<eos> I need ketchup.<eos> So are we gonna talk about it?<eos> - What?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> You're gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you.<eos> I know about the cure, Elena.<eos> You do?
He needed someone to talk to after you left the conversation without telling him what you were thinking.<eos> That's not exactly how it happened.<eos> And I quote-- "She stared at me like I was an alien and then basically teleported out of the room."<eos> Damon Salvatore stands in front of you and tells you that he wants to become a human again.<eos> Wouldn't you freak out?<eos> I just--I needed some time to process.<eos> I mean, 24 hours ago, I didn't even think it was possible to become a human again.<eos> But you want to be a human again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I did.
They were just trying to help.<eos> Look at me.<eos> They're not helping!<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> You took the cure.<eos> You're human.<eos> You don't want to feed on me.<eos> - Yes...<eos> - Please.<eos> Elena, I do.
Hello.<eos> Is Kirsten home?<eos> Why no, she is not.<eos> Liam?<eos> I knew there was no point in trying to surprise you, but I hope you're happy to see me.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> Come in.<eos> But I have to go.<eos> I don't.<eos> Yes, we do.
And before that a yurt in southeast Asia.<eos> Shut the front door.<eos> A yurt by choice?<eos> Well, I'm a cultural anthropologist, so I need to immerse myself in different ways of life, so I can contribute something positive to the local community.<eos> And you?<eos> Me?<eos> Oh, I don't do anything to help mankind.<eos> I'm completely self-absorbed.<eos> So where does Kirsten fit in all of your good-doing?<eos> She doesn't.
Enough!<eos> Dale!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Christine Price and this is my friend Eva.<eos> Excuse me, I need some air.<eos> And you all know each other?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
She's outside the dome and was born with severe brain damage from your drinking.<eos> She'll never talk, never read.<eos> Why did you lie to the group?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just can't imagine her the way that she is.<eos> What I did to her.<eos> So I just imagine something else, you know?<eos> She's out there with new parents, and they're helping her and loving her, and... the doctors are fixing her brain.<eos> 'Cause I can't live if I don't think that she has a chance, so...<eos> But she doesn't.
He's one of us.<eos> Just recently converted.<eos> There's a way to save the town.<eos> How?<eos> Emotion.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, you're not going anywhere.<eos> Are you ready to face judgment?<eos> You're all sure you want to do this?<eos> Like you even need to ask, Red.<eos> Hell yeah, I do.
I knew you weren't one of us.<eos> Julia is still alive, isn't she?<eos> I bet she's...<eos> What did you put in the tea?<eos> I had to, Eva.<eos> I'm not gonna let you hurt my baby.<eos> Have you made up your mind?<eos> Are you going to help us take down the dome?<eos> I don't really have a choice, do I?<eos> Neither of us do.
Sorry, I got to find her.<eos> Barbie, they are gonna have her hidden, under heavy guard.<eos> - This is their new queen.<eos> - That's ridiculous!<eos> She's a baby!<eos> She's nobody's queen.<eos> She was conceived and born in three days.<eos> - She's not human.<eos> Look, I know how you feel...<eos> No, you don't.
I just wanted to help.<eos> And you can do that by helping Sam take the children back to Town Hall.<eos> Come on, sweetie.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> You are not our queen.<eos> - Run!<eos> - You're human.<eos> I'm so sorry I did this to you.<eos> That little girl almost drowned right in front of me.<eos> But she didn't.
Just like that.<eos> How do we know the two of you aren't Life Forcing it up?<eos> I was never cocooned.<eos> I'm human, remember?<eos> I wouldn't have brought Christine here if I thought she was dangerous.<eos> If I wasn't certain she was one of us now.<eos> She's here to help us find my daughter.<eos> Is Dr. Bloom still working on the umbilical cord?<eos> When Hektor went after Joe, it wasn't just me who tried to stop him.<eos> Dr. Bloom did, too.
She loves you.<eos> I told her I wouldn't wait.<eos> The only thing stopping you from choosing Jack is you.<eos> I don't deserve him!<eos> - But you deserve me?<eos> - Ben, I'm sorry.<eos> Jack's flight leaves in 20 minutes.<eos> What are you doing here, Mason?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> - Yes, we did.
She didn't show any of the usual signs.<eos> Oh, Louise.<eos> It's normal to look for answers at a time like this.<eos> But we read her note.<eos> She was resolute in her decision.<eos> Was she, though?<eos> I mean, I saw the date book on her desk, and she scheduled a mani/pedi for next week.<eos> Now, why would someone with a death wish worry about their cuticles?<eos> Just doesn't make any sense.<eos> Death rarely does.
Not too long.<eos> Your snoring woke me up.<eos> I don't snore anymore.<eos> You know, in D.C., I could hear the Metro station from my apartment.<eos> The trains would wake me up every morning.<eos> This is a much better way to wake up.<eos> Yeah? Your snoring is like a train.<eos> It's much cuter.<eos> I don't snore.<eos> Yes, you do.
Cops dropped all the charges.<eos> Hey, asshole!<eos> You look like shit!<eos> Come here, come here.<eos> I'm catching a lotta shit from Felix over this.<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> No, no,.<eos> Look, the cops don't know anything.<eos> They don't?
♪ But can't we just be about it?<eos> ♪ ♪ Show me what you gonna do about it. ♪<eos> Damn, you ain't playing no games.<eos> So, do I have the job?<eos> I'm trying to keep it at three, but we got three girls we like, you know?<eos> You definitely a contender.<eos> What do you mean "three"?<eos> Three girl group.<eos> On Instagram, it didn't say anything about a girl group.<eos> Yeah, it did.
But come on, chop-chop.<eos> I made coffee.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> Looks like our friends just arrived.<eos> I'll meet them downstairs.<eos> Rise and shine, baby.<eos> Good morning, Ms. Ford.<eos> Just-Just wait a second.<eos> Article 45 states no warrant can be served in a federal case without a signature from the presiding judge.<eos> No, it doesn't.
I just wanted to make a portrait worthy enough of an heir to an Empire.<eos> Hey, yo, Mal, man, let's work.<eos> What is this?<eos> Can't we get this out of here?<eos> Why, man?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Yeah, if tacky and ugly is beautiful.<eos> You think that's, uh, tacky and ugly?<eos> No, he didn't mean that.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Those ones, too.<eos> Just, uh... see that?<eos> This is what I live for.<eos> Everyday people taking photos of my art and posting their own interpretations of it.<eos> You know, when your music video goes viral...<eos> Which it will...<eos> The price of the original is gonna just skyrocket.<eos> I want the original.<eos> You already got the original.<eos> I do.
Just, uh...<eos> Hakeem Lyon, get your black ass down here.<eos> Well, okay, Miss Thing.<eos> Since you already know the choreography, let me see it.<eos> Okay.<eos> ♪ ♪ Three, four, five, six...<eos> Hey, Cookie, you should let me spit Hakeem verse.<eos> You know, just to get them into it.<eos> I got skills...<eos> No, you don't.
Your Majesty.<eos> May I be of service?<eos> What do you think of all this?<eos> The spectacle.<eos> The monarchy.<eos> I would appreciate your honest opinion.<eos> I'm happy to be employed in Your Majesty's home.<eos> But if I'm to be honest, I find some members of your household to be...<eos> Reprehensible.<eos> So do I.
Why couldn't you walk it in?<eos> 'Cause there's a mole inside the task force and I didn't have that picture, solid evidence yet.<eos> And you're protecting a source, hmm?<eos> Send me the picture.<eos> I'll put it through Homeland Security.<eos> Ray.<eos> Jason Faber.<eos> Are you sitting down?<eos> You really think we can make up for all the things that we've done?<eos> Yes, I do.
Mrs. O'Connor...<eos> Alex trusts us.<eos> Can you help us find him?<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> Well, if he does call, and I'm sure he will, have him call us.<eos> Call me.<eos> I'll do everything I can to get him home safe, I promise you.<eos> So you believe that he's alive, then?<eos> Yes, I do.
If I can get a look in, I might be able to find a pattern in his operational tactics, an MO, something that would give us a lead onto him or Black Dagger.<eos> And Sam is going to believe that a senior FBI agent is a mole, with no evidence, based solely on the word of a man he knows for certain has broken the law?<eos> What makes you think he'll even hear you out?<eos> Alex.<eos> I need to talk to you, Sam.<eos> Okay. St... What are we talking about?<eos> I didn't kill Michelle.<eos> I've done some bad things but for the right reasons.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I do.

[laughs] What?<eos> I used to want this so bad.<eos> Why?<eos> Dad got it for mom in Paris.<eos> She'd wear it whenever she got really dressed up.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Mm, I think it was before my time.<eos> It was the most beautiful thing in the world.<eos> I wanted to wear it to prom, But mom said I'd lose it.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.
Just hurry up and get here, okay?<eos> I love you too, baby.<eos> (Sarah) what was that about?<eos> Don't be afraid, okay?<eos> But there are men outside, Really bad men, Who want to hurt us.<eos> The FBI agents?<eos> (Natalie) no, they're not FBI.<eos> They're SVR.<eos> (Sarah) oh, my god, we have to call the cops.<eos> No, we don't.
You want to hang with me now?<eos> You see, that's probably not a good idea 'cause I'm drunk and I am bound to say something stupid like how much I like you.<eos> I like you too.<eos> Yeah, but you see, it's not the same, you know, 'cause ever since prom, all I can think about is our kiss, but all you seem to think about is Karma.<eos> - Felix, that's not true.<eos> - Amy.<eos> We have to talk about Karma.<eos> She's out of control.<eos> I know, but I don't know what to do, unless you have some tranquilizer darts handy.<eos> Do you?
Don't start a sentence that way.<eos> Fine.<eos> If Yates didn't do it, then how did he know that body was there?<eos> Your DA thinks I'm the one who did this.<eos> You know, I am the one who told you all about her.<eos> That's exactly why he thinks you did it.<eos> Is he always so circular in his reasoning?<eos> You told me that you were called to that house, that you knew a woman was there.<eos> Do you know who she was?<eos> I do.
They fought, especially when they drank, and they both drank.<eos> She loved her Gewurztraminer.<eos> Remember the last time you saw her?<eos> I remember when she left.<eos> Greg threw me a birthday party, and Carl brought a new date.<eos> He said Lena had broken off their engagement and moved back to Switzerland.<eos> And that was...?<eos> Early February 2002.<eos> So you didn't think it was strange that she didn't say good-bye to you herself?<eos> I did, actually.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I can do that.<eos> So, uh, me and... me and my wife Tabitha, we were getting ready for bed and she says...<eos> I think I heard something, downstairs.<eos> Again?<eos> Maybe outside.<eos> It's--it's a dog or a cat or squirrel or something.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Go.<eos> So I did.
He knocked us out right when we got our best lead.<eos> We could cross-reference the name Mr. Scratch against old statements.<eos> We'd have to go to the paper files.<eos> We don't have time.<eos> This unsub's probably already found every kid that made an accusation from back then.<eos> If we don't get back online soon or get a lucky break in this case, we're gonna be looking at more drugged victims and dead bodies.<eos> Ahem. Getting online is gonna be a lot harder than you think.<eos> Whoever engineered this, he did a complete and total network and infrastructure shutdown.<eos> But I thought we had firewalls to protect from this kind of breach.<eos> We totally do.
We need to get you looked at.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Hey, this is not a suggestion.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have to talk about it.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Yes, tonight, while it's still fresh.<eos> I can't.<eos> It doesn't...
What is it?<eos> Uh, Dillon Kingman's Great Smoky alibi just went up in smoke.<eos> And according to his credit card, he went to the same local gas station twice yesterday.<eos> 2.2 gallons at 7:03 a.m. And 15.4 gallons at 9:22 p.m.<eos> What kind of car does he drive?<eos> Audi A6, 2012.<eos> With a highway to city ration of 4 to 1, averaged to 29 miles per gallon, which is standard for that make, model, and year, he traveled roughly 450 miles, which assuming one way and back<eos> puts his destination-- 225 miles away.<eos> I want to believe you, Ezra.<eos> I really do.
Like 10 minutes ago.<eos> Hurry up, we're late.<eos> It's Kate.<eos> She's back in town.<eos> I hate lying.<eos> You would hate it more if we missed this 4for1 concert.<eos> True.<eos> And Bobby is hot, so you know he has cute friends.<eos> He'd better.<eos> He does.
Got released? No.<eos> He went AWOL yesterday.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> No idea.<eos> You a sniper like him?<eos> Female Engagement Team, yeah.<eos> Connor used to talk about it.<eos> Killing somebody from a distance... didn't feel real.<eos> Until... it did.
I'm sorry, is there a problem, Doctor?<eos> You know what my problem is, Mr. Rogers?<eos> No, but I instinctually feel like you're going to tell me.<eos> 100 patients with mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, substance abuse disorders, bipolar disorders, to name but a few.<eos> Not enough time, not enough money, not enough beds, not enough staff, and now, you.<eos> I'm sorry, Doctor, I'm just trying to do my job.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> I'm also gonna need the visitors log.<eos> Lots of people are in love with the idea of having kids, but most have no idea what they're getting into.<eos> Did you and Michelle?
So, how did it go with Agatha?<eos> Oh, I was right.<eos> My father is the instigator.<eos> Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Do you plan to reproduce?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Are you going to procreate at some point?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I think about it sometimes.<eos> I don't... Why?
I recognized him when I saw the news.<eos> He came to see me after what happened to Patrick.<eos> And he questioned you?<eos> I didn't know he was a driver for the company.<eos> He said he was a reporter.<eos> He was both.<eos> We believe he started driving because he was digging into Zooss.<eos> What did he want to know?<eos> Mostly about Patrick's job, like if I knew about any problems Patrick had at work.<eos> I didn't.
-Without parole.<eos> - Shit!<eos> No wonder you look stressed.<eos> She'll have made plans. Do you know anything about them?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> We're not besties.<eos> It's not like she shares.<eos> Well, you'll just have to make sure she does, hmm?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We still do.
I know about a promise you made.<eos> You said we wasn't gonna get arrested.<eos> The promise is still good.<eos> Do you have cuffs on?<eos> (ruzek) all right, do you recognize these two?<eos> Great!<eos> So you know them.<eos> Look, no one outside of this room is gonna know what you say.<eos> Who tried to rob the truck?<eos> They did.
You said we wasn't gonna get arrested.<eos> The promise is still good.<eos> Do you have cuffs on?<eos> (ruzek) all right, do you recognize these two?<eos> Great!<eos> So you know them.<eos> Look, no one outside of this room is gonna know what you say.<eos> Who tried to rob the truck?<eos> They did.<eos> They did?
Listen, Josh, the last thing I want to do is make you feel awkward.<eos> What?<eos> Me?<eos> No. You!<eos> Awkward!<eos> Me?<eos> What?<eos> Look, we had a little thing before she left.<eos> Actually, we didn't.<eos> We almost did.
Me.<eos> I still can't believe it.<eos> Only you would get a job that just so happens to be across the hall from the elephant.<eos> But I asked the elephant a hundred times and he said he was cool with it.<eos> So what am I supposed to do?<eos> I need a job.<eos> Well, on that note, take a seat.<eos> Sofia, I don't need one of your pep talks that's actually a lecture.<eos> Oh!<eos> But you do.
Because I read people. I listen.<eos> And I listened to Kyle when he said he's going to New York with her.<eos> You know, a nice man would have told me that.<eos> Well, you didn't marry a nice man.<eos> But it does have something to do with Kyle, so you're not completely wrong.<eos> Ah. Flatterer.<eos> She wants to go, he decides to go with her, and she doesn't want to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah, well, it does make sense.<eos> It... it does.
We don't know that any of this even happened.<eos> Yeah, I'm all for overtime, but don't we have enough work to do?<eos> Guys, this isn't LMZ.<eos> It is a legitimate national news magazine.<eos> They interviewed her.<eos> She disclosed.<eos> And I got a call from dodds, who got a call from the mayor.<eos> So we are going to investigate.<eos> We don't even know who this girl is.<eos> America's Worst Crimes does.
So let's go to the top and find out.<eos> Okay. You want me to come with?<eos> Not necessary.<eos> President Roberts and I have history.<eos> _<eos> I'm assuming this is about that broadcast?<eos> It is.<eos> So the victim said that she was shut down by the university.<eos> Do you know who she spoke to?<eos> - I do.
You deserve better than what they did"?<eos> Look, I know the guys, you know, like, messed with her on the way out.<eos> I felt badly.<eos> The guys?<eos> You were there too.<eos> That text was to check in on a friend.<eos> That's not proof of a criminal act.<eos> How about the others, Brian?<eos> We have DNA proof that you weren't the only one.<eos> You do?
Yes, naturally.<eos> If the man or men or women were here to do arduous work, the hours would have been long. They would have needed to eat, hydrate and, of course, expel waste.<eos> Toilet seat was up, so I'm guessing at least one person was a "he."<eos> Also we found this in the fridge.<eos> "Doogh."<eos> Carbonated yogurt drink popular in Arab countries.<eos> It's hard to believe bubbling yogurt is popular anywhere.<eos> I figured it didn't belong to the Ayers, so I called the American distributor.<eos> No place on the island sells it.<eos> Six stores in the city do.
Collin was your middle name.<eos> Now, we're guessing the decision to change it has something to do with you serving 18 months for insider trading?<eos> The name change was aboveboard;<eos> I'm not breaking any laws.<eos> My real estate dealings go much more smoothly when my criminal record isn't the first thing people learn about me.<eos> I imagine they would.<eos> Because Louis Eisely was a particularly cutthroat Wall Street trader.<eos> From the early 2000s.<eos> A man whose downfall, at the height of his career, made his name synonymous with Wall Street greed.<eos> I did my time.
No, it's not.<eos> These people...are not your friends, in spite of what Liz might say.<eos> Ah, she does seem chatty.<eos> Probably been bitching about me already, has she?<eos> Has she?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Let her.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't want any part of that clique.<eos> I don't.
FBI's not gonna let that happen.<eos> Besides, I don't think you really care about those files you stole.<eos> The one you... need, the one you want, truth about your brother. All you got to do is let me in.<eos> Keep your hands up.<eos> Inside.<eos> Move. Now.<eos> How is he?<eos> He's lost a liter of blood.<eos> You got the file on my brother?<eos> I do.
Yeah.<eos> And what about what Nathan needed?<eos> Hmm? He goes off and he dies for his country, and they won't tell me nothing about what happened to him.<eos> He was my best friend.<eos> The only one who ever believed in me.<eos> Nate.<eos> Little Nate with the... bright eyes and the... crazy smile.<eos> A smile I will never see again.<eos> We understand, Marcus.<eos> You don't.
If I fold my hands and apologies in front of you. He won't like it<eos> After all, he's my younger brother.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> I'll apologies a lot to him.<eos> Fine.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But you don't be scared.<eos> If there's any problem, just call me.<eos> You have my number, don't you?<eos> - You do, don't you?
Bring her here.'<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> I'm not going to do that.<eos> I'm keeping her as an insurance policy.<eos> Oh, and by the way, I had to get rid of your little Irish lapdog.<eos> - 'What have you done to her? '<eos> - She'll live.<eos> Which is more than I would have, right?<eos> 'I don't know what you mean.'<eos> Yes, you do, Grandma.
I'm going with "planet." Speaking of pencil necks, somebody's got an eyeball on you.<eos> See if he knows what the IAU is.<eos> Looking for some fun?<eos> You're late!<eos> But before we go anywhere, I need to know you can protect me.<eos> And my family.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> I'll make sure your family is, too.<eos> You don't know these people! You don't know what they can do!<eos> Oh, yeah, we do.
If we burn him, there is no evidence.<eos> There is no trail.<eos> There's no him anymore.<eos> Let... let me go get him out.<eos> That is not what God wants, Keith.<eos> Maybe you misunderstood the message.<eos> You said just...<eos> You believe I'm anointed, right?<eos> I'm your Solomon. You believe that?<eos> - I do, but...
That's why I'm giving you one last chance to save your own life.<eos> Tell the truth, Shelly.<eos> Or you too... will end up a spot on the wall.<eos> Root, are you there?<eos> It's me.<eos> I need your help.<eos> She's alive, Harold.<eos> We wrote her off for dead, but she's alive.<eos> We don't know that, Ms. Groves.<eos> Except we do.
Fight me!<eos> Wow. I don't know where it came from.<eos> No. I-I don't want to fight you, Pam.<eos> I'm actually really glad that I don't have to sue you.<eos> Sue me? Why would you sue me?<eos> Uh... Well, you did Dre's vasectomy.<eos> I thought I was pregnant.<eos> No, I never did Dre's vasectomy.<eos> Oh, he canceled and rescheduled at least five times, but he never came in.<eos> He didn't?
Sweet Muse and wait for him and kill him.<eos> I never imagined anyone would get hold of this paper.<eos> No, how could you have?<eos> The next issue comes out tomorrow.<eos> My guess is they've already posted a response to your source in it.<eos> OK, we need to get to that paper before her source does, otherwise they'll kill him.<eos> I'll get Ellie on it.<eos> Well, we know that whoever abducted Sophie, did it to get to her source, to silence him.<eos> - Yeah. - You said when you got here that you didn't think it was Wombosi.<eos> - And I still don't.
Well, most public computers are administrated, the user can't just go in and delete their own history or access the cache or cookies.<eos> This computer's wide open.<eos> There's no trace of him anywhere.<eos> Could be why he chose this place.<eos> He knew he could cover his tracks.<eos> Well, I knew the email address wouldn't be traceable, but I thought there'd be something.<eos> We better head back.<eos> There's one more thing we could try.<eos> Sir, do you still have the ID card for WN453?<eos> Er, yes I do.
-It's okay.<eos> -Hey.<eos> -Got the mic.<eos> -And the warrant. -Okay, would someone mind telling me What the fuck is going on in here?<eos> Talia, these are my friends, dea agents.<eos> Andrew grier, jeffrey young.<eos> So fucking what?<eos> So.<eos> We need you to tell marlon you know where leo's hiding out.<eos> I do?
I know you don't want to discuss it, but you should know if there is a referendum to abolish the Monarchy... I know which way I'll vote.<eos> Tonight could be every night.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> The Sultan of Bhondai just cock-blocked us.<eos> What?<eos> The villa in Monaco is out.<eos> We got bumped.<eos> Are we okay with that?<eos> - We don't have a choice.<eos> - Of course we do.
The Bishop is all about grooming young churches.<eos> Just sometimes, they need a little tough love.<eos> I'm here to follow your lead.<eos> Now, that's what I want to hear.<eos> Yes, now, if the Bishop decides to work with your church, there are steps to take.<eos> First of all, you'll have to join our One in the Savior council.<eos> We know, and we would love to be a part of it.<eos> This quarter, we're raising funds for missions to West Africa.<eos> The Lord has so much work to do there.<eos> Yes, he does.
Trust me, it's worth it.<eos> We were ta...<eos> What?<eos> Speak up, Paul, I can't hear you.<eos> We were talking about the barriers that people put up, and it turned into this... this thing about clothes and how they're just... just... another barrier that we use to keep ourselves from ever really seeing each other.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's deep.<eos> So that's the kind of philosophical brilliance you come up with when you're smoking meth, Paul?<eos> Meth?<eos> They did that.
He told me his name was Alex.<eos> People lie, Danny.<eos> And they lie well.<eos> Guys who own rooms like that attic... When it comes to sex, they know what they want, how they want it.<eos> The sex is professional.<eos> And he didn't know what he enjoyed.<eos> He'd never found out.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> It doesn't matter what I believe.<eos> But, yes... I do.
Of course.<eos> He has access to the entire plane, just like we do.<eos> Runs the length of the plane.<eos> And you looked everywhere?<eos> Well, we didn't pull out all the luggage 'cause there was no sign anyone was down here. Aah!<eos> There's a snake on the mother-flyin' plane.<eos> You're lucky it wasn't the pit bulls we had to ship last week.<eos> Look at this luggage.<eos> Since when does the airline allow clothes hanging out of bags?<eos> They don't, not usually.
Okay, we need to isolate her before she carries out<eos> - whatever her plan is.<eos> - How?<eos> Go to your seat.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Something very stupid.<eos> She has a gun.<eos> Which is why I want you as far away as possible.<eos> You know I feel the same way about you, right?<eos> I do, I do.
- You don't know what it's like.<eos> - I do know what it's like.<eos> Then, however you fly, whatever ship you sail in, take me with you.<eos> How do you know I had a ship?<eos> Because I'm incredibly clever.<eos> It doesn't matter... take me with you.<eos> We'll talk about it.<eos> - This thing you're looking for, I'll help you find it.<eos> It'll be quicker. - I don't need your help.<eos> Yes, you do.
In death.<eos> No!<eos> Doctor, what have I done?<eos> What have I done to these people?<eos> Stop this!<eos> They are defenceless.<eos> Ashildr!<eos> - He doesn't care.<eos> - But I do.<eos> Oh, God, I do.
There's more to it than that, Gino.<eos> But I can't tell you.<eos> Anna.<eos> You're playing into his hands.<eos> To worry, or wonder, that's what he wants.<eos> Even if it's true, and it's not, it's not our place.<eos> Gino...<eos> He's toying with you, bella.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> Yes, Anna, I do.

Tell them their father is doing work here.<eos> - Important work.<eos> - Let's tell them together.<eos> Come home.<eos> What's going on, Vol?<eos> Why did you ride all the way up here?<eos> Why do you think?<eos> Vice Chancellor Voske sent you.<eos> She knows you've gone rogue.<eos> They all do.
- You're right. - Yeah.<eos> Um, Dad and Nora adopted the baby.<eos> Wow.<eos> They still calling it Lily?<eos> Yeah, you don't like that?<eos> Who cares what I like?<eos> I care.<eos> I mean, you gave her to us.<eos> Did you tell Dad? No.<eos> - Jill, did you?
For all we know we could be distant cousins.<eos> Related.<eos> So... how about you help me out... cuz?<eos> No prescriptions, no medicine.<eos> Fine.<eos> Well, if you won't help, maybe your husband will.<eos> I need some Timolol.<eos> - I'm not her husband.<eos> - We have a connection.<eos> No, we don't.
Do you have glaucoma?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I need some drops.<eos> - No, you need a prescription.<eos> - How do I get a prescription?<eos> - You have to see the doctor.<eos> - And where's the doctor?<eos> - I'm the doctor.<eos> - You live with the pharmacist?<eos> - What? No, I don't.
It's to make you stronger, Bernie. All right?<eos> It's a tough world out there.<eos> Look how it's treated me.<eos> Would you keep your hand still, please?<eos> Your father walked out, I lost my job.<eos> We need a fresh start, we need to be strong.<eos> I don't want to be strong if it means I have no friends.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You've got friends.<eos> No, I don't.
"Do or do not.<eos> There is no try."<eos> - Yoda.<eos> - Okay, - I think I'm gonna see if Cameron is free...<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> - I can do it.<eos> - You sure?<eos> I have a close working relationship with our quantum computer.<eos> What I don't have, though, is a cassette player.<eos> Now you do.
What you diagnosed as endogenous depression.<eos> It's what killed your relationship.<eos> And you have a child together.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Do you believe me now?<eos> Why don't you tell me.<eos> You don't know what it's like to be abducted.<eos> To be taken against your will.<eos> You don't know.<eos> Well... maybe you do.
_<eos> _<eos> And then after a while, he asked me if I wanted to come in.<eos> What did you talk about?<eos> How Kyle was doing.<eos> Glenn got him a tutor over the summer.<eos> And then he asked me if I was coming home.<eos> Sounds like you're surprised.<eos> I didn't think he'd want me to.<eos> But he does.
I promise, she won't even see me.<eos> It'll be like I'm not even there.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> There was a... It's nothing.<eos> Jill's happy.<eos> - Did she take my letter?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.
The town was losing its shit and he was in charge.<eos> And I guess now he needs to lose his shit, too.<eos> He's not in charge anymore.<eos> And we left town.<eos> Wherever you go, there you are.<eos> Young lady, you are wise.<eos> Michael, the boy next door... he says his sister departed.<eos> She didn't depart.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - Because I do.
Throughout history assassins have never been motivated by money or revenge.<eos> They're motivated by beliefs.<eos> And their targets embody a belief that enrages their would-be assassins.<eos> Why?<eos> Because secretly, they share that belief.<eos> John Wilkes Booth loved black people.<eos> Hated slavery.<eos> Hated it.<eos> - Did you know that?<eos> - I did not, Senator.
Sorry about that, sir.<eos> Now how can I help you?<eos> Did you drink the water?<eos> The... but I was... I was so thirsty.<eos> Okay.<eos> She locked me out.<eos> Looks like you're locked out, too.<eos> Hey.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I tried to call you.<eos> You didn't pick up.<eos> I had to give their donations back.<eos> - Donations?<eos> - What?<eos> You mean their money?<eos> You had to give their money back.<eos> Well, we're gonna need money if we're ever gonna get the permanent space.<eos> - We don't need a permanent space.<eos> - Yes, we do, Tommy.
- I'm not leaving you. - Alex, no. I got this.<eos> Alex!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Get in.<eos> You okay? Yeah, yeah, let's go.<eos> _<eos> Why else do you dig a hole in a mountain and hide?<eos> Because it makes you hard to kill.<eos> Of course angels got out.<eos> Yes, but did Gabriel?
Over a dozen people have been hurt, and two kids are critical.<eos> The floors I gave to the V-1s have been burned.<eos> I don't think that's a coincidence.<eos> Of course it's not a coincidence.<eos> It never is.<eos> My father worked with David Whele for years, and in just three months, I am being suffocated by him.<eos> How am I supposed to change this city when he undermines or destroys everything I try and do?<eos> Claire, I've spent enough time with you to know that I don't need to answer that question for you.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> You don't.
We make mistakes, same as anyone, sure, but when we do, we confess.<eos> No secrets.<eos> No sins.<eos> As the leader of the town, it's my job to take the confessions of each and every person.<eos> Harper was reluctant to reveal her secrets.<eos> I was pressuring her, and she ran away.<eos> And now that she's returned?<eos> That means she's ready to confess, and we can all move on.<eos> The real question is, how do you know Harper?<eos> - I don't.
Ah. You know what?<eos> A lot has changed, but not that smile.<eos> So... what did you want?<eos> Um... surveillance camera caught a shot of your rebels when they escaped, and, uh, that's one of the crates the Agri-tower guys use to deliver food.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> They left behind all their gear and guns, and they took this... why?<eos> What's in it?<eos> I don't think it's corn.<eos> Hey, my key... do you have it?<eos> Yes, I do.
Don't be long, sweetheart, okay?<eos> Dad:<eos> Sarah?<eos> Are you coming?<eos> We've got to get going.<eos> I'm coming!<eos> Dad:<eos> I'm happy that Rachel is taking you on this trip.<eos> You've had a rough year.<eos> - We all did.
Yeah.<eos> A website for serial killers.<eos> Who knew?<eos> You know, a few weeks before my sister died, we went to Virginia Beach for her birthday, just the two of us, and we were laying there and I asked her what she was thinking.<eos> And she said, you know, Kate, if anything ever happens to me or Joe, just promise me that you'll take care of my little girl.<eos> And, I mean, of course I said I would.<eos> You know?<eos> Nothing was going to happen to her.<eos> She was 24.<eos> And...just like that, it did.
Just backpacking across Europe, maybe sharing an apartment together.<eos> That would be great!<eos> You're gonna need another travel mug for all those memories you make.<eos> Oh, uh, I forgot the best part.<eos> Look inside.<eos> Okay. Wow.<eos> Tickets to Ed Sheeran.<eos> Yeah, he's playing the Pepsi Center on Saturday.<eos> I know you really like him, so...<eos> Yeah, I do.
I always think he's talking to somebody behind me.<eos> Well, I got a lot of homework, guys.<eos> Uh, so who... who were you with?<eos> I'm not supposed to say. - Oh. - Oh.<eos> Well, now you know you have to, right?<eos> Okay, look, it was Eve Baxter.<eos> We've been hanging out the last few days.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> And don't you two have anything interesting in your own lives to talk about?<eos> Now we do.
Uh, it's just... it's right, uh...<eos> So, that's my dad.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I think he's fun.<eos> I think we built the wall on the wrong border.<eos> I am really glad that you're doing this, Ryan.<eos> It's good that you guys spend some time together.<eos> Yeah, well, he never had time for me my whole life, so I gave up on him.<eos> But you said you wanted to put that all behind you.<eos> I do.
It's the wrong key.<eos> No, it's a bump key. Ok?<eos> And in a perfect world, they'd have a snap gun for this. Quick as nick, but this is Mexico.<eos> We gotta make do with what we got.<eos> Watch.<eos> Like this.<eos> It's all in the reflexes.<eos> Now you try.<eos> Did you at least see the safe?<eos> I did, yes.
Now would be the time to do so.<eos> Immunity idol. Any votes cast for jenn will not<eos> Any votes cast for jenn will not count. Count. I'll read the votes.<eos> I'll read the votes.<eos> The first vote.<eos> The first vote.<eos> Does not count.<eos> Does not count.<eos> Does in the count.<eos> Does in the count. Jenn. Jenn.
- Oh, it's worse.<eos> How do you have one of the Amphorae?<eos> Where did Rhais get it?<eos> You move again, and I'll open it!<eos> You're an eight-ball.<eos> No.<eos> He's a dyad.<eos> Half human, half higher angel fused together, living in a single body.<eos> I never thought they existed.<eos> Well, they do.
- Men.<eos> I'm gay, and I can tell you're hitting on me, which is really flattering.<eos> Believe me, I'd be all about you if I were into women.<eos> Uh-huh. Go away now.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Miss Hapstall, how often do you go to the Gladness Spa?<eos> Once a week.<eos> I've got a herniated disk.<eos> How we doing?
Classified.<eos> I should have said no, but I get the distinct impression that my position in this clinical trial is contingent on doing him favors.<eos> So, do them.<eos> I mean, don't people leak information all the time?<eos> You hear what I said?<eos> He's leveraging my health, my life.<eos> Harold, you're a decent man.<eos> The man I fell in love with, and now you're asked to do something indecent.<eos> But if you are telling me that your life depends on whether Tom Connolly gets what he wants, you know my opinion.<eos> I do.
Even if just a couple of hundred votes were changed in each, that would be more than enough for Mrs. Florrick<eos> - to steal this election.<eos> - That is correct.<eos> So you would advocate for a recount in those precincts?<eos> Of course I would.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Mr. Nolan, in your meeting this morning with Mrs. Florrick, did you say that you wouldn't have swung the vote for her because she turned down a bribe that you offered?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Shall I repeat the question?<eos> - No, I did not.
If we're staying here, you have to take care of Peter.<eos> You can get gas from the truck.<eos> - For what?<eos> - To burn him.<eos> No.<eos> If you burn him, the sickness will not spread.<eos> We don't know how it spreads.<eos> I understand.<eos> You knew this man.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You think Patrick's dead already?<eos> You think he just-- he left and never came home?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What is she?<eos> Susan.<eos> She's your friend.<eos> All the more reason.<eos> - She's dead.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Go on.<eos> There was a man shot like the others, like the rest, but he-- he wasn't sick.<eos> And there were others like that.<eos> When I was young, these men-- these men were from the government.<eos> They came to our town and they took some people away.<eos> And my father was someone of certain importance in the community, so he went to speak to the captain and asked, "When will they return?"<eos> And the captain told my father,<eos> "Miguel, don't worry.<eos> They always come home."<eos> And they did.
And so do I.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> No food or drink shall be consumed until its safety can be confirmed.<eos> Take it back.<eos> You believe Her Highness is poisoned?<eos> I believe many things.<eos> I believe this palace is a symbol of our king, of his power, of his country, and our enemies have stopped at nothing to destroy it.<eos> Since the first stone was laid in this expansion, His Majesty knew this day would come.<eos> So, do I believe that our enemies would dare to poison King Charles of England's sister?<eos> Yes, I do.
As was my duty.<eos> What contact did you have with her, in particular?<eos> I served her tea.<eos> - What kind?<eos> Chicory.<eos> It gave her great comfort.<eos> Though I was never the one to prepare it.<eos> Do you know who did?<eos> Do you know who did?<eos> Yes, I do.
Not you, Montcourt.<eos> Seal the doors. No one enters.<eos> My prayers have been with Her Highness all day, Sire.<eos> Do you think God will hear you?<eos> - I don't know, Sire.<eos> Of course.<eos> What about the angels?<eos> The angels?<eos> - Do you see them now?<eos> I do not, Sire.
What happened?<eos> You know you're not supposed to eat nuts.<eos> You're usually so careful about that kind of thing.<eos> I don't...<eos> You don't what?<eos> She was going to stop being my friend.<eos> Oh, gosh.<eos> Do you know what you almost did to yourself?<eos> Do you know what it would do to me if anything ever happened to you?<eos> Do you?
Your time's up.<eos> You want your friend to survive this?<eos> Maybe even get his life back?<eos> Then you'll look into my eyes, and you'll see I'm the only person who can help him.<eos> Please.<eos> Where is he?<eos> You got anything to tie him with?<eos> He's not going anywhere.<eos> How do we kill him?<eos> We don't.
Not you.<eos> An American company was paying the same terrorists that we're fighting.<eos> I had to do something!<eos> How many people died because you did what you had to do?<eos> You disobeyed a direct order.<eos> Because of it, your entire unit was killed.<eos> That was you.<eos> I wouldn't be here.<eos> Your friends would still be alive.<eos> You did that.
I heard her on the wire.<eos> So did all the other listeners.<eos> I had to throw myself on the mercy of... our benevolent employers.<eos> I had to identify her.<eos> I told them she was a kid. I told them she was my kid.<eos> I mean, hell, I worked for them for 16 years.<eos> It's got to be worth something.<eos> 16 years?<eos> Did you know she had a film?<eos> She did.
How much of his money?<eos> All of it.<eos> Holy crap!<eos> Mom, are you kidding me?<eos> That guy's worth like $10 billion.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You turned him down, didn't you?<eos> I can't accept his money for something that's a total waste of time.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I don't understand.<eos> If you have a chance to save your child, even a small one, you take it.<eos> So, this is about something more than that.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Well, we just feel that...<eos> Maybe she wasn't meant to come back to us.<eos> Maybe God wanted us to know that she was gonna be okay in the other place.<eos> And now that we know that... We have to let her go.<eos> I'm sorry, but you don't know that.<eos> No one does.
It helps me to feel my connection to her.<eos> Have you ever thought about talking to someone professionally?<eos> - You mean like a shrink?<eos> - A grief counselor.<eos> I've done that.<eos> I'm happy, Dr. Tyler.<eos> I get to be with my wife again.<eos> And I don't really care why it's happening, and I don't want to be cured.<eos> If you'd lost someone like I did, you'd understand.<eos> You did, didn't you?
It was sweet of them to let me bring Henry.<eos> Though why couldn't he stay behind with a tray on his lap?<eos> Don't be unkind.<eos> I never see him.<eos> He's only up here now to look at some horrid racing car.<eos> - Does he get on with Philip?<eos> - They were friends as boys.<eos> I'm afraid she doesn't like my daughter-in-law.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> - And who does?
You know, whatever legal help Nash's Jane Doe needs, tell her she's got it.<eos> I got a call from County.<eos> She's regressed back into a coma.<eos> Damn it!<eos> We were... friends.<eos> You think you know someone, and then this.<eos> Dr. Nash.<eos> Charles.<eos> I have a theory.<eos> Of course you do.
Your time's almost up.<eos> All right, I'm getting to the good part.<eos> Ethan was wearing the neural helmet when he died.<eos> And the computer continued receiving data.<eos> After he was dead?<eos> Do you know what this means?<eos> Probably that your computer downloaded a ton of meaningless and random brain activity?<eos> Or that we recorded an actual experience of what somebody has when they die.<eos> It's worth investigating, don't you think?<eos> I do.
Nothing.<eos> There is no "next."<eos> And I'm not gonna let them paw through his entire life to find something that doesn't exist.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Ethan was a scientist.<eos> Don't you think he would want us to keep looking if it led to a new discovery?<eos> But that's not for anyone to say...<eos> Not you or me or Ivan Turing.<eos> Look, Julie, I understand how hard...<eos> No, you don't.
I understand the potential, but this is not the right way to find what you are looking for.<eos> I'm not shutting this down.<eos> Look, I want answers as much as you do.<eos> It's how you knew I would agree to do this in the first place, but I do not want to find out this way.<eos> It's not right.<eos> There may not be another way.<eos> There is always another way.<eos> We will keep looking.<eos> We have time.<eos> Maybe you do.
Okay. [Clears throat]<eos> Do you want to tell me the whole story, or should I just stand here and go crazy?<eos> Turing asked me to investigate life after death.<eos> I'm looking for scientific proof of what happens when we die.<eos> Really?<eos> And in exchange, he's donating money to medics international.<eos> I know it sounds crazy.<eos> But it's a lot of money, and there are a lot of people...<eos> I don't think it's crazy, I think it's pretty brilliant.<eos> You do?
Great.<eos> You can let it out.<eos> Are you the doctor that's going to cut me open?<eos> Well, where I come from, we like to call it surgery.<eos> And, yes, I will.<eos> Where did you go to school?<eos> I went to medical school at Penn.<eos> And for my undergraduate...<eos> Did you get good grades?<eos> I did.
I'm here to see you.<eos> Halima, I need to tell you the truth.<eos> I'm sorry, but the only reason why I agreed to marry you was because... I wanted to go to medical school.<eos> That's all that it ever was for me.<eos> Just a business arrangement.<eos> There was never anything real between us.<eos> So you need to go.<eos> No.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> I do.
And, Louie, I am very much looking forward to last night's dinner.<eos> Oh, and, just for fun, I made sure that we will have a table outside on the terrace with a view of the city, you know, just in case our meal turns out to be, um, memorable... in some way.<eos> Patrice...<eos> You think you're ready for this... Dinner?<eos> I definitely am.<eos> I... if you still want to go.<eos> So...<eos> What do you say, Louie?<eos> I say... I do.<eos> I... do. Ohh.
Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> Sebastian,<eos> I need an ambulance to my GPS signal.<eos> - Is he OK?<eos> - Barely.<eos> I don't know how to say this, so, I'm just... going to be direct.<eos> Are you aware that your husband kept secrets from you?<eos> You mean... did I know that he slept with men?<eos> For a long time I didn't.
Maybe if I hadn't...<eos> Would you like some water?<eos> Why don't you let us get that for you?<eos> Okay.<eos> Gastric bypass was a pretty good cover story.<eos> Maggie could explain away the trip out of the country, any follow-up appointments, any pain or cramping.<eos> What if she really did book that surgery?<eos> Well, you looked at her pretty closely at the morgue.<eos> If she had had her stomach stapled, wouldn't you have noticed?<eos> She didn't.
Not necessarily.<eos> 40 pounds of concentrated opiate can be cut and processed into 300 pounds of street-grade horse.<eos> Now, even the largest cartels lack the facilities to perform that kind of alchemy overnight.<eos> It's hard to imagine Escanso and Turk were working for a cartel.<eos> The big syndicates have their own pipelines.<eos> They wouldn't waste time planning a one-off score like this, with amateurs.<eos> Amateurs have to sell to professionals eventually.<eos> Well, the DEA should have a list of cartels that can handle that kind of weight.<eos> You two feel like knocking on the doors of a few drug lords this afternoon?<eos> Yes, I do indeed.
Sue, just -- oh, why are you taking his side?<eos> I'm not!<eos> I understand you're upset!<eos> Why are you taking her side?<eos> ! I'm not taking her side.<eos> I'm just trying to -- oh, mom!<eos> Stop!<eos> Forget it.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Yeah, you really don't.
- Beck?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Imagine, for a few drinks, no?<eos> Imagine...<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> You gamble away my McLaren and now you're frolicking by the pool.<eos> Relax, Ashok.<eos> We have a plan to get your precious car back.<eos> You do?
Where I come from, a little money is a lot of money.<eos> So you killed him for money?<eos> I killed a man with a hammer once.<eos> Killed another man with my bare hands just for looking at my girl.<eos> - I'm sure she appreciated that.<eos> - Those times were for free.<eos> I never would've done what I done to your brother if I'd known it was him.<eos> And not 'cause he was a prince. 'Cause he was him.<eos> They said it was a military accident.<eos> Of course they did.
There is no shell so hard I cannot find a way in...<eos> Though I believe the lovely widow Sibley, given time, will open herself willingly for me, like a rose.<eos> Yes, my dear.<eos> I'm aware that your charms are exceeded only by your self-regard.<eos> The real question is whether Mary Sibley is hiding something from us or someone is hiding it from her.<eos> You are indeed a sphinx, Ma'am.<eos> Whatever do you mean?<eos> Well, let us just say that I do not know if she has, in every sense, what it takes to complete what she's begun.<eos> But we may find that out tonight due to her timely invitation.<eos> And if she does not?
He got a hit on the DNA.<eos> I got it.<eos> Start calling adoption agencies and the parish registrar.<eos> Need to identify this Phil and Anne.<eos> All right, just to warn you, I know this case is ultra time-sensitive, but I'm trying to remain in STSM, which is Standard Time-Sensitive Mode.<eos> Might seem like it's at cross-purposes, but I'm getting results.<eos> Whatever works, bud.<eos> Okay, so Loretta was able to retrieve enough tissue from under Jorge Gomez's fingernails to run a search.<eos> And you got a hit?<eos> I did.
Uh... Jorge.<eos> I mean, he-he was a... he was a good friend.<eos> He knew Annie and I's story and... knew how desperate I was.<eos> So when you questioned him, he, uh... he asked me to come to his house.<eos> He-he asked me if I took the baby.<eos> And I just... I...<eos> I lost it. I...<eos> We fought and...<eos> Well, you know how it ended.<eos> I do, Phil.
Look, nothing personal, but, you know, I've moved a lot, so I have this system that I use.<eos> Duffel bag full of essentials only.<eos> And... one Jess cube.<eos> You can't get rid of me.<eos> Look, Jess, when I move, I make a clean break, okay?<eos> I'm not going to get all sentimental.<eos> And you promised you wouldn't make a big deal.<eos> No, you're right, you're right.<eos> I promised you I wouldn't.<eos> - You did.
We just booked a gig at Lenny Destefano's birthday party!<eos> So, are you in the band, Darryl?<eos> Heck, yeah, I'm in the band!<eos> Yeah!<eos> The Itty Bitty Ditty Committee just got their first giggy!<eos> You guys, I blocked out my schedule every day after school for band practice.<eos> Every day?<eos> That's a lot of practice.<eos> We don't want to sound too rehearsed.<eos> Uh, yeah, Gene, we do.
"Excessive body hair must be covered."<eos> But I need to wear a tank top.<eos> Need to?<eos> Why?<eos> Because of this rash...<eos> shida Jones.<eos> Uh, big fan.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> She likes tank tops, too.<eos> She does.
Are you here to thank me?<eos> Here to arrest you.<eos> Or you can turn yourself in.<eos> I know, Sasha.<eos> About the port, the trucks, the shipping company.<eos> I'm a businesswoman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your business is using Navy resources to make the port into a Hellmouth.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> But Paul Jenks does.
Now!<eos> Pick it up!<eos> Christopher.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What needs to be done, King.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I've wanted this bastard for 20 years.<eos> He doesn't deserve a new start.<eos> You're right.<eos> He doesn't.
We're done in here.<eos> If something bad's abo5t to happen to my city you need to tell me.<eos> This is New Orleans, Dwayne.<eos> Something bad's always happening.<eos> Yousureyou'reokay to do this?<eos> That which does not kill me.<eos> Plus, with Lasalle at the mermaid's funeral, you could use a wingman.<eos> Good morning.<eos> So, you want to see everything that's come in in the last week.<eos> Yes, we do.
I don't know, Mom. 'Cause I really think high school's where we went off the rails.<eos> Fine, whatever.<eos> I also wanted to apologize.<eos> It's not your fault about Roscoe.<eos> Him not wanting to be here just broke my heart.<eos> And the only way I could deal with it was by blaming you.<eos> I get it.<eos> My kid looked me in the eye and he said he didn't want to live with me.<eos> Do you have any idea how much that hurts?<eos> Actually, I do.
He's driving it round some track nearby<eos> - at Catterick.<eos> - Testing it, seeing how it handles.<eos> I can take you, if you like.<eos> - Would you?<eos> - I'd like to see it.<eos> - How about you?<eos> - I'll be in London on Wednesday.<eos> - Edith has a date.<eos> - No, I don't.
What's wrong?<eos> I wanna make sure Sara doesn't hear us.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> Well, I was, uh, on campus and I went by the photo studio and they said you hadn't come in.<eos> Then when I came home and you weren't here and you didn't pick up your phone, I panicked.<eos> I-I know, my phone died and I mixed up the dates at the studio, I..<eos> ...actually booked time for tomorrow, not today.<eos> But where were you?<eos> You told me you were going to The Brew.<eos> I did.
...actually booked time for tomorrow, not today.<eos> But where were you?<eos> You told me you were going to The Brew.<eos> I did.<eos> And then we went to the data center.<eos> Why?<eos> What'd you do, follow me?<eos> No.<eos> - I put a tracker on your car.<eos> - You did what?
- Sabrina!<eos> - Oh, hi. Spencer?<eos> Spencer.<eos> Yes, I'm a friend of Ezra's.<eos> So you want to place a pastry order?<eos> Um, not exactly.<eos> I, um..<eos> Sorry. Um..<eos> I don't know if you know my story.<eos> I do.
I do belong in therapy.<eos> But it's not what I wanna be doin' right now.<eos> What do you wanna do?<eos> Simple things.<eos> Take a walk on the beach.<eos> Swim in the ocean.<eos> I can't get back the time I lost, but..<eos> I don't wanna waste any more of it sitting in a room having someone analyze me.<eos> I don't expect anyone to understand any of this.<eos> I do.
- Oh, you lived there too?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did eight months. I was running crank for the Mongols.<eos> Bureau sold that apartment as "next door to a sex party."<eos> Ah. Yeah, that's the spot, man.<eos> I tell you, after a long day in the field, the last thing you need is to hear some bimbo screaming, "Harder,"<eos> through the walls, you know?<eos> Well, small world.<eos> You know, Colby, I actually do have a room opening up here.<eos> No, you don't.
Mom, I-I can't talk to you when you're like this.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> You're slurring your words.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Hey, what do you say we go to the movies tonight?<eos> If my mom comes with us.<eos> Emily, I've gotta go home.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought you said your mom....<eos> I did.
Work? Sara's got a job?<eos> That's great.<eos> God, if I went through what she did, I don't think<eos> I'd remember how to read, never mind be able to...<eos> We all remember how to read.<eos> No, I mean, that..<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know the right thing to say here.<eos> Of course not.<eos> No one does.
I mean, I have been used and abused by that girl more times than I could possibly count.<eos> But she has changed.<eos> She's been through so much.<eos> And she's desperate.<eos> And I know that she needs you.<eos> No, I think she got what she needed.<eos> I think you're wrong.<eos> Alison's never had anyone like you in her whole life.<eos> Somebody who saw something in her that was vulnerable and genuine.<eos> I did.. ...but I don't anymore.
What's the rush, Clark?<eos> We know who hired you for this party.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Where's Charles?<eos> Look, get out of the way.<eos> You guys are totally off base.<eos> Whose photo did you plan on shooting with this?<eos> Look, get your hands off of me, alright?<eos> You guys have no idea what you're doing.<eos> Actually, I do.
You know what?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll ask to borrow someone's cell phone.<eos> No harassing our customers.<eos> Did you know your pants are ripped?<eos> Yes!<eos> Uh, excuse me, sir, can I borrow your cell phone?<eos> I locked my keys in my car, and I got to call my husband.<eos> Uh, I don't, uh, have a cell phone.<eos> You don't?
Do you have my ticket and my passport? Yeah.<eos> So far, so good. We're getting along today.<eos> We shall she as the day progresses how it goes.<eos> I see some lovely ladies.<eos> Hi, ma'am, I'm trying to get to nice, France.<eos> - Passports, please. - Yep.<eos> Guess it's on 17:55.<eos> Thank you so much, have a nice day.<eos> Get ready for the Riviera.<eos> We do well as underdogs.
Aly and I were athletes, so being physical and running is actually one of our strong suits.<eos> So pretty.<eos> I could get used to this.<eos> It's kind of nerve-racking just waiting here.<eos> Hopefully we see sweaty Mike soon with some roses and chocolates.<eos> It's so pretty.<eos> It's awesome. Who wants to treat their partner?<eos> - You do it.<eos> - Ok. Who wants to treat their partner?<eos> I do, I do.
What's going on?<eos> You've been set up.<eos> The Cabal's been asking about you, Lizzy.<eos> They know who your mother was.<eos> You've been set up.<eos> You were there when the Orea building was bombed.<eos> They wanted you to save Clifford Hawkins.<eos> They sent Karakurt to the memorial to make you think he was the threat so you would secure the Senator and infect him in the process.<eos> I don't have the virus.<eos> You do, Lizzy.
I have an appointment.<eos> This is a war that must be fought on many fronts.<eos> You have yours. I have mine.<eos> Be safe.<eos> We have three broad-spectrum frequency jammers being off-loaded now.<eos> You want to run them from the catwalks?<eos> Yes, space this size-- no communications will get in or out. I'm confident of that.<eos> I don't need to tell you there is no margin for error.<eos> That's correct.<eos> You do not.
You know they think I killed her, right? The cops.<eos> Did anyone tell you that?<eos> That's not really part of my story.<eos> I only want to know her name.<eos> Look, I had a bad drug problem back then, and the cops... they used it to screw me over, okay?<eos> I'm 10 months sober now, and I don't belong in here.<eos> So if you write about me...<eos> I'm not writing about you.<eos> You want to know about Alice or not?<eos> You do.
You're the most extraordinary woman i've ever known.<eos> You know me, i'm already over it. You take it...<eos> To protect your heart.<eos> What do i tell her when she asks what our $8 billion program is really designed to do?<eos> Whatever you want, as long as it's not the truth.<eos> Hey, fisher, i was right.<eos> Ed clark didn't commit suicide.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> He does.
So, tell me what's going on?<eos> Are you enjoying a hunk of fisher pie?<eos> Oh, is this girl talk?<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> Look, i know he's fisher-licious, but...<eos> Liam's been gone less than a week.<eos> The body's still warm.<eos> There is nothing going on between me and fisher.<eos> Huh. Okay, well, if you want my opinion On turning liam down--<eos> I don't.
Is there a procedure for waking him up?<eos> - What are the risks?<eos> Tell me what the target is.<eos> Tell me where the attack<eos> - is going to happen.<eos> - Keep him awake, Colonel.<eos> - Stand back, please.<eos> - Sir, please.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
Charlie?<eos> You really don't hear that?<eos> Hear what?<eos> It's the Mourning Cantata for King Frederick.<eos> Losing my mind.<eos> Well, you've come to the right place.<eos> How's an American citizen end up in a hole like this?<eos> Just look enough like Yamamoto to piss off the Rotary Club.<eos> Or just look like a plain old white fella who went to the wrong meeting.<eos> Well, did you?
Yes, well, you can give him a chance to atone after the war.<eos> I have family in Eastern Europe.<eos> Cousins that I never met and some that I never will, and my son has never met his grandfather, who is sitting at a pay telephone 10 miles from this office.<eos> The Jewish people don't just need Palestine, Colonel.<eos> We need each other.<eos> What about this?<eos> What if solenoid 132B was out of alignment...<eos> Um, an electrical arc occurs at, uh, section P22.<eos> Yeah, and none of the detonators fire.<eos> But they did.
Oh, that's discouraging.<eos> Did I give you the impression I was finished?<eos> Even worse, apparently they really hit it off with P-ville's lady pastor.<eos> [scoffs] Mind-boggling.<eos> [sighs] Guess we've got our work cut out for us.<eos> That's why I've decided to step up and come with you.<eos> Ah, n-no offense, Russell, but having you there will exponentially increase our chances of failure.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, I'm not so sure you know the proper usage of "no offense."<eos> Yes, I do.
He's slightly bigger than you but not as good.<eos> Gemma, I made a mistake but it wasn't about sex.<eos> I didn't want this to happen.<eos> I know you won't believe me, but when I met Kate, we just sparked.<eos> I had to find out what it was.<eos> So, helpless?<eos> And yes, I didn't want Chris to find out because of the money but that wasn't the main reason I didn't tell you.<eos> Selfish? Nasty?<eos> It's because I still love you.<eos> Despite all this, I do.
Well, we may find some answers in that alley.<eos> Let's go check it out.<eos> Okay, Castle and I are gonna scrub traffic cams.<eos> Maybe we'll find the shooter there.<eos> Anything yet?<eos> No.<eos> No blood, no shell casings, no nothing.<eos> Hey, doesn't this remind you of, uh, that sketch from "Saturday Night Tonight" where, uh, Mickey Franks plays Sherlock Holmes' wacky cousin?<eos> No, I don't watch that stupid show, bro.<eos> - You don't?
You don't have to do this, Daisy.<eos> This isn't who you are.<eos> You don't know me, ok?<eos> Now get up.<eos> I know you're not a child killer.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Now move!<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> Move!<eos> But you do.
Too bad. I'm keeping him.<eos> Give him to me, and we'll give you a life where no one is hunting for you.<eos> That's what you asked for.<eos> No. That was when my sister was alive.<eos> That means nothing to me now.<eos> You're not being rational.<eos> When he gunned her down, she looked right at me.<eos> I can still see her face.<eos> I understand your loss.<eos> No, you don't.
Do you know where he took her?<eos> No.<eos> Ambulance is a minute out.<eos> You're gonna be all right.<eos> Tell command I want every camera in this city looking for Theo's car.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> So is it a boy or a girl?<eos> God. Do you know how broken you are?<eos> I know exactly who I am, doctor.<eos> Most people don't.
Yeah,theyalwayssay that.<eos> I'llprobablywalk thesecondIget there.<eos> I'mhereif youneedme. I'llbethinking'boutyou.<eos> Oh,sureyouwill.<eos> Yeah .<eos> You'llbesniffingcokeoff ofsomesororitygirl'stits , thinking," iwonderhow Charlie'ssobrietyis coming?"<eos> Lift your scrotum, please.<eos> Itjustcoversyou likea-- awarmblanket insideandout.<eos> Hey, it's a new guy.<eos> How you doing, new guy?
That's what your recovery is all about, having the Serenity to accept the things we cannot change.<eos> Joining us today, we have Charlie mills.<eos> - Charlie. - Hi, Charlie.<eos> Is there anything that you'd like to share with us today, Charlie?<eos> No.<eos> No? Okay, Charlie.<eos> Well, just know that if you continue to refuse to accept the disease that put you here, you will continue to be a repeat offender.<eos> Don't you mean repeat customer?<eos> You have a disease, Charlie.<eos> We all do, all right?
- In this crowd, Drake?<eos> - Yeah. Listen, raise your hand if you ever sold your ass for drugs!<eos> Huh?<eos> You were funny, man. Heh.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I can't publicly endorse what you did, but you got something.<eos> It's not for everybody.<eos> It's for you, just being up there.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Think about it.<eos> Also think about who your second whip would be.<eos> Better you pick than a blind draw.<eos> You need to sign this.<eos> Julian, Marco, that's enough.<eos> Give Jonathan his hat back.<eos> Who... who are... who are you here for?<eos> Owen Farhidi.<eos> Mr. Farhidi, he call.<eos> Uh, yes, he did.
I see any police, I kill the boy.<eos> Okay, we still have a unit with Farhidi?<eos> Yeah. Absolutely.<eos> - Bring him in here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You heard his demands.<eos> You got the address.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> I don't have that kind of money.<eos> - I do.
Delete this one!<eos> It looks bad.<eos> No!<eos> For you and Amir Reza's expenses.<eos> No, I don't need it.<eos> You just gave me money.<eos> Just keep it.<eos> C'mon.<eos> - Why don't you pay your debt?<eos> - I did.
For you and Amir Reza's expenses.<eos> No, I don't need it.<eos> You just gave me money.<eos> Just keep it.<eos> C'mon.<eos> - Why don't you pay your debt?<eos> - I did.<eos> Akbar is upset with you.<eos> - Pay your debt.<eos> - I did.
- You know...<eos> - But we talked.<eos> - Yeah, you know what?<eos> You've got...<eos> - And... to have your life-altering journey, okay?<eos> And I stayed behind.<eos> And I held stuff down.<eos> And I silenced myself so that you could grieve.<eos> If you need to grieve, we can...<eos> I did!
- The bedroom.<eos> No work in the bedroom.<eos> Next point.<eos> I will provide a safe harbor.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You need a place to not be Catherine Avery... To not be decisive and set agendas and rise to the level of accomplishments that the world has come to expect of you.<eos> You need a place to fall apart.<eos> I will be that place... should you require it... in perpetuity.<eos> Richard, do you take Catherine to be your wife for as long as you both shall live?<eos> - I do.

It is a shame, that you did not die as well.<eos> Jack You and I we are at war!<eos> Who are you, Jack Stone?<eos> Hands up!<eos> I trusted you.<eos> Jack?<eos> She's dead because of you.<eos> I had no choice, Jack!<eos> I had a family.<eos> So did I!
We are all drawn together, those of us who are touched by the gods.<eos> That's why I can sense you in my dreams?<eos> We are more alike than you know.<eos> We should not linger here.<eos> Then where do you suggest we go?<eos> Back to my mother?<eos> She wants you dead.<eos> What about you?<eos> How... How do I know that you won't just turn me in?<eos> You do not.
"Sex between consenting adults comes in many forms and varieties."<eos> I see no problem with that.<eos> Just wait.<eos> "There's sex between a man and woman." Did you do this?<eos> No. Taco did this.<eos> Is that me?<eos> No, I think that's the big-boned lass from the bus.<eos> PAM: This is unacceptable.<eos> Ellie has a very vivid imagination.<eos> Actually, she does not.
- Really?<eos> - Yes, he helps everyone.<eos> Whatever problem you have, financial, family, he'll help you!<eos> That's nice!<eos> I'm very fond of him.<eos> It's thanks to him I found my vocation.<eos> Come in, Dad.<eos> Listen, Andrea... we haven't discussed this matter yet... but I think it's time I told you what I think of your vocation.<eos> I already know.<eos> - You do?
It happened a lot in the early 90's With the mc-gang.<eos> When the Bondes had a demolition job In Aarhus- Then he was a driver For some escort girls.<eos> - The McGangens? - Yes.<eos> Was it Robbie Carlsen and the others?<eos> Yes, but he does not seem Have been a member<eos> In 1996 he received a conditional sentence of violence Due to an attenuating circumstance.<eos> The customer had raped the girl.<eos> In 1997 it happened again.<eos> "Then he sat in three months.<eos> - Then I did the lump.
Yeah!<eos> I can really pack 'em in!<eos> Be careful how loud you say that.<eos> Check out all these hotties.<eos> This is the best party ever!<eos> But it's weird... I haven't seen any of my friends.<eos> No, th-they're here.<eos> You know, th-they're around.<eos> Yeah, no one wanted to miss the chance to party with San Francisco's... sexiest bachelor.<eos> No, they didn't.
No, you shouldn't be.<eos> Finally, I get to see you as a couple!<eos> Couples fight.<eos> Couples have arguments.<eos> That's healthy and normal.<eos> Well, then we're the most healthy, normal couple you'll ever meet.<eos> What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> There you go.<eos> You have my blessing.<eos> - We do?
- Yeah, you read.<eos> - All right.<eos> "Lincoln serves up an inspired menu of farm-fresh fare "with a casual elegance from the pici carbonara to the lamb 'Parmitier'"...<eos> - Parmentier.<eos> - Pot pie.<eos> "The meal danced across my palate with a symphony of flavors"...<eos> "Which is fitting because, according to his mother, "the owner Nathaniel Marlowe's approach "stems from his philosophy that food is like music, every ingredient a note."<eos> - You read my cards.<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> I did.
What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about I'm a woman who you've been bullying to get what you want. Bullying?<eos> I'm paying you.<eos> And that doesn't mean that I exist to serve your needs.<eos> Well, it goddamn should.<eos> If you spoke to Donna that way, no wonder she left you.<eos> Because you don't just pay people to be loyal.<eos> How dare you?<eos> I don't give a shit about the money, and I never did.<eos> No, you didn't.
Well, Leader ended up a paperweight, so I'm gonna say, yeah.<eos> We can't worry about that now.<eos> What matters is saving the last humans.<eos> We agree.<eos> But King Sauron is too powerful.<eos> Even with my spider powers, I could never scale Sauron Tower undetected.<eos> A fine pair of Saurian sad sacks you are!<eos> You want to change the way dino-people think, we've gotta take action!<eos> The angry red human has a point.<eos> Of course I do!
'Hi, this is Clara Oswald.<eos> 'I'm probably on the tube or in outer space. Leave a message! '<eos> Can you change your voicemail message, please, it's getting very boring.<eos> Oh, I see you've accessorised it.<eos> Yes.<eos> - The old question marks.<eos> - You used to wear question marks.<eos> Oh, I know, yes, I did.<eos> They were nice. Why don't you wear them any more?<eos> Oh, I do.
Well, perhaps I was too hasty.<eos> I'd like, for the moment, to take in the music.<eos> Besides... plenty of other items on our agenda.<eos> The fucking Congo can wait.<eos> Oh, your troubles are weighing heavily on you.<eos> I'm not entirely sure why.<eos> I was told that you know the person responsible.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course we do.
This allegation of a vendetta is completely fabricated.<eos> This motion itself is an overreach.<eos> Save the Ivy League oratory for trial, if we get there.<eos> Before I rule on defense's motion, I'll need to speak to the M.E.'s office and Sergeant Benson.<eos> We're adjourned.<eos> - Olivia.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Thank you for meeting me here.<eos> Your squad know about the situation?<eos> They do now.
You applied for the sergeant's exam?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah. Why?<eos> I don't know. What'd Liv say?<eos> She thought it was a good idea.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> You should think about taking it.<eos> You'd be on the fast track here.<eos> Don't want to be a detective forever.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Your Honor, exhibit "A"...<eos> The medical report on the victims.<eos> The M.E. and the girls will testify to what they suffered in Mr. Drake's custody.<eos> Tell us what happened next.<eos> Well, we heard the sound of breaking glass, and when we ran down the hallway, we found Johnny D attempting to escape with Ariel Thornhill as his hostage.<eos> He was holding a shard of glass to her neck.<eos> Eventually he surrendered, at which time, we placed him under arrest and read him his rights.<eos> Do you see the man you apprehended<eos> - in this courtroom today?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Gil's in San Diego.<eos> I am sure.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I know I wasn't what your old partner was for you.<eos> No, you weren't.<eos> I grew more in my last 4 years with you than I did in the 12 years that I was with him.<eos> You know, that relationship, whatever it was, didn't allow for anything else.<eos> But with you, with your support...<eos> I have a family.<eos> Yes, you do.
He's got hours on us.<eos> I've heard nothing conclusive.<eos> What about Mason and Korsten's motive?<eos> I'll find out.<eos> Well, when that time comes, we'll know whether<eos> - to drop our other two suspects.<eos> - With all due respect, sir, there are no other suspects.<eos> - Korsten has the polonium.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
OK, get your hands up in the air where we can see them.<eos> I suggest you leave now if you want to live.<eos> You got visual?<eos> Take the shot.<eos> Johnny?<eos> It's OK.<eos> We just want to talk to you.<eos> Seems I have their attention.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
Zed's rotator cuff was all jammed up, and then, there was Linus' driving.<eos> Zed?<eos> We'll explain later.<eos> And there's nothing wrong with my driving.<eos> Yeah, anyway, while Linus was busy driving like my grandmother, I ran the photogrammetry on the picture.<eos> - Kelli is in...<eos> - a small room with cement walls.<eos> - Yes, but did you notice...<eos> - the walls are covered with plastic.<eos> Yeah, we did.
What is that?<eos> This is my pitch for what they should change the name to:<eos> the Washington Breadsticks.<eos> Is this real? Are you serious?<eos> Yeah, I mean, it sounds like Redskins.<eos> Listen closely.<eos> Breadsticks. Redskins. Breadsticks.<eos> Redskins. It just makes sense.<eos> Yeah, I don't know if it does.<eos> It doesn't, no.
You let me in.<eos> Especially you two, Javier, Kevin.<eos> You've made me your brother-in-arms, and I thank you for that.<eos> And Kate.<eos> Seven years ago, I thought I would never write again.<eos> And then you walked through the door.<eos> And my whole world changed.<eos> You were right...<eos> you said I had no idea.<eos> But now I do.
He's bringing his girlfriend to dinner.<eos> His girlfriend?<eos> Do you really think that's appropriate?<eos> I mean, if I would've known he wasn't coming alone, I might have preferred we do this at a restaurant.<eos> Oh, it'll be fine, honey.<eos> Sure, it'll be fine, but how are we supposed to have a real conversation with his girlfriend here?<eos> A conversation about what?<eos> We haven't seen each other in 20 years, Mom.<eos> You don't think we need to talk about why?<eos> No, I don't.
Sure, it'll be fine, but how are we supposed to have a real conversation with his girlfriend here?<eos> A conversation about what?<eos> We haven't seen each other in 20 years, Mom.<eos> You don't think we need to talk about why?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> It'll just upset your father.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Dad still doesn't know about this?<eos> About what Nate called you?<eos> No, he doesn't.
She's doing good.<eos> Let me ask you something...<eos> Where was callie when i dropped off carmen last week?<eos> I had to let callie go.<eos> Hmm... I thought she was doing really well.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She was.<eos> She was doing great.<eos> So what happened?<eos> He did.
Military sources tell us she is a deserter...<eos> Harrison, you see what they're doing here?<eos> And subject to court martial as a traitor...<eos> I mean, do you hear this?<eos> Harrison, we need to do something, don't we?<eos> Hi, Anna.<eos> - Hi, Bob.<eos> Harrison, you okay?<eos> What do you want, Anna?<eos> What do you...
You passed.<eos> "Traumatic grief within normal range."<eos> "No other psychiatric disorder indicated."<eos> "Recommendation - six sessions" "to be increased to 12" "at the discretion of the psychiatrist in charge."<eos> A copy will be forwarded to all the relevant parties.<eos> You dodged a bullet.<eos> I don't know how but... worth dinner and flowers at least.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jimmy has an alibi.<eos> He always did.
I don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> - Why did you...? - Yes.<eos> I'm saying yes.<eos> I'll try to trust you.<eos> Rosa.<eos> We trust to our peril... but to not is to be alone... and then...<eos> Oh, the silence.<eos> Is that not why you keep us all so close?<eos> You see, I understand you, Inspector,<eos> I really do.
That is the wrong answer.<eos> Tell me where your wife is.<eos> Tell me where she is.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> Come on, Castle.<eos> No woman is worth dying for.<eos> Come on. Where is she? !<eos> I believe that you're telling the truth.<eos> I do.
Where?<eos> Dad!<eos> Hey. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> I'm okay. I'm okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No sign of Katherine Beckett, sir.<eos> E.S.U. says the building is secure.<eos> There's no sign of Beckett.<eos> Why doesn't Beckett trust me?<eos> She does.
I'm okay. I'm okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No sign of Katherine Beckett, sir.<eos> E.S.U. says the building is secure.<eos> There's no sign of Beckett.<eos> Why doesn't Beckett trust me?<eos> She does.<eos> Then why is she keeping me in the dark?<eos> - I don't need protecting.<eos> - Yes, you do.
So you didn't need my damn eyes on this at all, huh?<eos> No, I...<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We can run some surveillance on known DARPA facilities.<eos> It could be black market.<eos> You should ask hunter to contact the back-alley traders he knows.<eos> Hunter's not talking to me.<eos> You know why?<eos> I do.
Yeah, briefly at Widzew Lódz.<eos> You should have seen this guy.<eos> He was... he was the fastest ever.<eos> At Juventus, they used to call him Bello di notte.<eos> And today, one hundred million, just for his bad foot.<eos> How come you're no longer manager of Legia?<eos> How come...<eos> I left because of a... let's just say because of a difference of opinion.<eos> And was this difference of opinion with Victor Arshad?<eos> To do with your connection, to the right-wing followers of the club?
Listen to me.<eos> I am done with Juliette.<eos> I just want it to be official.<eos> Let's just sign the papers, please.<eos> Okay, well, Luke's lawyers are sending over the final paperwork for her buyout today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bye.<eos> All right. Let's go see aunt Beverly.<eos> Do you think she knows we're here?<eos> You didn't. Right, mom?
What does the Hill of Stones look like?<eos> You're not thinking of magicing there, are you?<eos> Tell me.<eos> I thought you didn't want to use dark-one magic.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> Well, if you insist...<eos> Please... please take me to my brothers and save them.<eos> No!<eos> Do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> Aye. That I do.
Be good. See ya.<eos> Let's have fun.<eos> Anchorman: You're saying it's just a coincidence this body was found in the same location as the hillside stranglers' first?<eos> I-i can't comment on that at this time.<eos> Kent? Mm-hmm?<eos> How come you're not married?<eos> Kent?<eos> Just haven't met the right woman yet, sweetie.<eos> I think you'd be a good daddy.<eos> [ Chuckles ] You do, huh?
I'm sorry. Come on.<eos> I meeting another friend there, too.<eos> There's something I want to show you that I think you'll like.<eos> It'll be a party.<eos> Just tell them you're sick and you gotta go home.<eos> God, I wish.<eos> But, you know, i have my patients, and...<eos> I thought we had a real connection.<eos> What?<eos> We do.
There's that stolen tanker.<eos> Damn!<eos> They're headed toward the res.<eos> You'd better stop him, or we're gonna lose jurisdiction!<eos> Get closer!<eos> Can you see him? !<eos> Now I got you.<eos> He's on the reservation! Ugh! Where are we, pop?<eos> We've never been here before.<eos> How you doing, Ed?
A consolation prize?<eos> No, Wick, of course not.<eos> I care about you.<eos> But you love him.<eos> - And he...<eos> - He loves you, too?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know how many of you there have been?<eos> Do you?
'Cause this truck...<eos> Is good for selling a whole lot more than just chicken.<eos> Hey, Billy.<eos> I was surprised to get your call.<eos> Yeah, well, I know what a fan you are of surprises.<eos> Well, I'm eager to hear what was so urgent.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> You know, I thought that we were gonna be friends, Hap.<eos> I really did.
You're doing great.<eos> The baby's doing great.<eos> Hi.<eos> I guess I got my house party, just not in the house.<eos> We're gonna find the monster that did this to you.<eos> - Did you get a look at him?<eos> - Not right now, Hap.<eos> No, no, it's okay.<eos> Cody, did you see him?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I am kind of wondering why you're here.<eos> Does he love you?<eos> Who?<eos> My husband.<eos> Carla, I've got no idea<eos> - what you're going on about.<eos> - Jules, I saw you at the hospital.<eos> I know how Hap looks at something he thinks belongs to him.<eos> So does he love you?<eos> He did.
What do you mean you know, huh?<eos> What do you mean you know? !<eos> He killed my son, Wick!<eos> You have every right to be upset.<eos> That guy is a bad dude, trust me.<eos> - What's that mean? !<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> All you need to know is, you do not want to get mixed up with him.<eos> And you swear to me... you swear to me you don't know where he is.<eos> What if I did?
- Uh-huh.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Let me tell you something about these people. They only care about the money. They don't care about the land, and they damn sure don't care about the people.<eos> But you're different?<eos> You sign with me, you'll all get rich, and you won't even know I'm there.<eos> I'm sorry. I was just remembering the promise you gave to the farmer in Oklahoma.<eos> Now the only thing that lives on the land is misery.<eos> Well, you've heard half the story.<eos> And you have a better proposal?<eos> I do.
- Yeah.<eos> Even with the yellow flies and hurricane season?<eos> The truth is, I'd give anything to go back to that version of me.<eos> Of us.<eos> Then... Why don't we?<eos> I'm willing to take another chance on you.<eos> On us.<eos> Look, if that's not what you want, then you just...<eos> You really got to be honest now.<eos> No, I do.
Believe it or not, I don't even really like cameras.<eos> - I prefer my life undocumented.<eos> - Liar.<eos> I'm a very rare species.<eos> I am difficult to capture.<eos> You're running around here half naked.<eos> Just be what you are.<eos> Hmm? You're an exhibitionist.<eos> You like to be looked at.<eos> - Oh. - You do.
And so I'm supposed to just eat a bunch of fucking tacos in front of you, Nate?<eos> No, we're supposed to go together.<eos> You're right.<eos> That was the plan.<eos> We'll go.<eos> We'll go get Mexican.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> - You don't want to.<eos> It's...<eos> I do.
No, we're supposed to go together.<eos> You're right.<eos> That was the plan.<eos> We'll go.<eos> We'll go get Mexican.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> - You don't want to.<eos> It's...<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
First, the hair dryer in the bathroom was extremely wet.<eos> Well, maybe he electrocuted himself.<eos> Then returned it to its place on the counter and got back in the tub?<eos> Plus, the name on the card you're holding? It's Sloan!<eos> Same name as the couple arguing down the hall.<eos> You've said a thousand times there are no coincidences.<eos> Listen to me, Barney Fife. You know when there are coincidences?<eos> On the 4th of July weekend when we're scheduled to go to the Dodger game tomorrow night. That's when!<eos> Now if you don't call your Watch Commander back, do you know who's coming down here?<eos> Do you?
What happened to Danny, that was... Well, that was just me running out of options.<eos> When I showed up in the room, not only was he not out cold, but the jackass was still singing that terrible song.<eos> I have no memory of...<eos> of picking up a hair dryer... or throwing it in the tub, or holding his head underwater till he went... Glub glub glub.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now we've heard enough.<eos> Andrea, what do you think?<eos> If he agrees to eventually write all that down, Mr. Sloan may participate in the marriage ceremony and stay through the first dance with his daughter, provided the police escort him every moment and he doesn't try to get away.<eos> Mr. Sloan, do agree to the very generous terms offered to you in front of your family by the State and witnessed by the L.A.P.D.?<eos> I do.
-I'm talking about 1997, 4 March 1997.<eos> -No, Jaime Mayor.<eos> When José María Aznar was president of the government, there were people on that list who received extra pay as ministers,<eos> I'm not aware that José María Aznar did.<eos> I can't say that he has been paid. And certainly in 1997 I can't.<eos> Yes, and before that?<eos> There are entries here, not only one as the prosecutor indicated, in 1990 there are one, two, three, four, five, six entries with "Payment to J. M. 255,000 pesetas".<eos> The amount isn't significant.<eos> I agree on year but I don't think it's José María Aznar, I didn't pay him that.<eos> You didn't.
What the"<eos> First do his odd jobs, and then get slapped by him too.<eos> That's the fact.<eos> Ifs alright, sir.<eos> He pays us also.<eos> I admit...we're corrupt, dishonest.<eos> We live for no one but ourselves.<eos> I admit to everything.<eos> But don't we have any self-respect'?<eos> Of course we do.
Head over that way.<eos> I'll get just as far as I can.<eos> As soon as It goes for me, and I mean, the INSTANT it goes for me... run and get to the boat, and get as far way from here as possible.<eos> Maggie, there's NO WAY we're gonna let you do that.<eos> It's okay, Dr. Nelson.<eos> This way, I can give you two at least a chance of continuing your research.<eos> Maggie, I can't let you do that.<eos> I'm sorry, Professor.<eos> You don't have a choice in this.<eos> Yes I do.
- Is it a success?<eos> - What did she say?<eos> It's Myeong Soo.<eos> He says, "What are you doing?"<eos> When did Myeong Soo start using the messenger?<eos> It's because he's bored.<eos> He probably sent the message because he's bored.<eos> Go ahead and reply.<eos> - I did mention that we were together, earlier.<eos> - You did?
Really?<eos> We're gonna get into this now?<eos> You're almost 50.<eos> And?<eos> How do you think the boys feel?<eos> Who gives a shit, christina?<eos> They're grown men.<eos> Well, they're still our children.<eos> And why do you get to start over?<eos> You do too.
Yeah.<eos> You have to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I get to stay here all alone.<eos> You're an evil, evil girl, you are.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, ma'am, you are.<eos> Stop, stop, stop.<eos> I got to go.<eos> No, you don't.
It not a fucking job.<eos> I'm irrelevant?<eos> I'm fucking irrelevan.<eos> He's irrelevant.<eos> Makes me fucking suck.<eos> [ gulls crying ] Anyway...<eos> This fight with you and ryan.<eos> I've been giving it a lot of through.<eos> I want to see it happen.<eos> I do.
It's the only place I can come to relax.<eos> I know exactly what you're saying, man.<eos> I was never housebroken myself.<eos> Misha could never get that.<eos> "he who makes a beast of himself... Gets rid of the pain of being a man."<eos> There's no way you fucking made that up.<eos> Hunter s. Thompson.<eos> Ah, hunter s. Thompson.<eos> That guy knows some shit.<eos> Did.
It was hard to hear him with all the John Legend and the sobbing.<eos> You know what?<eos> I recently went through a very hard time, and I found something that really helped me navigate my feelings.<eos> - I don't want to paint.<eos> - Painting.<eos> Oh, my god, right?<eos> I am freaking out.<eos> You don't think that's because of what he heard us say, do you?<eos> No, lots of people gain weight during their engagement.<eos> - You did. ‭
Have you?<eos> Two days ago, an ill-wind whispered your name.<eos> Curious how you abandon your faith, but come back for him.<eos> Ash Williams.<eos> Go easy on him, he's a good kid.<eos> Go easy?<eos> Pablo has always taken the easy road.<eos> MiraTío, perdóname. Okay, you got every right to be upset at me.<eos> I completely dismissed everything that you did here, but I was so wrong, and I know that now.<eos> Do you?
And you don't have to admit it to me, but there's a part of you that knows you don't have to let your past define you.<eos> A part of you that really wants to be more than just a criminal.<eos> So I should be a hero like you, Barry?<eos> What exactly does that pay again?<eos> It's just a matter of time.<eos> Something you'll have a lot of in here.<eos> Not as much as you think.<eos> Be seeing you.<eos> You really think that leopard's gonna change its spots?<eos> I do.
Well, then I'll just have, you know, my people call your people.<eos> See, that's the problem.<eos> Neither one of us have people.<eos> So how are we possibly gonna do this?<eos> - There. My number. - Oh!<eos> That's what you meant, right?<eos> Yes, it...<eos> - No.<eos> - Yea... I...<eos> No you didn't.
Maybe I should step in.<eos> You really think that's such a good idea after what happened between you two at the Academy?<eos> All right, keep at her.<eos> Just a little while longer.<eos> We'll get our answer.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Do you think... do you think I had something to do with this?<eos> Because if you do, I...
Escort Mr. Drake immediately to the transporter room.<eos> Administering stimulants.<eos> Restarting brain activity.<eos> Welcome back, captain.<eos> Doctor.<eos> The intruders have been removed.<eos> You are free.<eos> I don't know how to thank you, Cad.<eos> William "Cadmus" Drake.<eos> Well, I do.
Wonderful.<eos> Carmella, we just lost our lunch table.<eos> Nice model you got there, except IMAXs are supposed to be big.<eos> That's kind of the point.<eos> Miss, if you don't have anything pertinent...<eos> Stop, you can't tear our building down!<eos> So excited, I feel like I'm in "Legally Blonde."<eos> Those Tiffany windows are over 100 years old, making it a historic, landmark building.<eos> Do you have documented proof of this?<eos> Yes, I do, your honor.
It's purely emotional.<eos> I can't really explain it.<eos> I can.<eos> It's your PPT.<eos> Your personal Pop-Tart.<eos> It is.<eos> It's my PPT.<eos> Then I totally get it.<eos> Yeah, you do, Max.<eos> You always do.
- Yeah, sort of.<eos> - Darling, shall we pop back indoors?<eos> - Yeah, good idea.<eos> '.. four, three, two, one.'<eos> Indestructible as ever.<eos> Married the diamond(! )<eos> Hello?<eos> Sir...<eos> - .. the ship, it came down, did you see it?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Are you kidding me?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Trying to build some business and thought you might want to see me.<eos> You thought wrong.<eos> This is a high school function.<eos> You're not invited.<eos> Shouldn't you have to have a permit or something?<eos> Seriously?<eos> You told me she wanted to apologize.<eos> She does.
What else?<eos> Butterscotch pecan.<eos> [sighs] My weakness.<eos> But I ate way too much tonight, and I'm totally exhausted.<eos> Plus, I have an early start tomorrow.<eos> Mm, Mondays are rough, but these could take the edge off.<eos> Could we save them for tomorrow?<eos> Only if I take them with me.<eos> [laughs] I do know you.<eos> You do.
You... you must've been about 18 years old.<eos> The first time you were locked up for some meaningless bullshit strong-arm crap that you'd done.<eos> You remember that?<eos> I remember saying to you, Rusty,<eos> "Rusty, you've got to take a different road.<eos> A new approach.<eos> Those days are over and done with.<eos> That kind of behavior, that violent-streak behavior is no longer gonna be tolerated by me or by the police."<eos> And do you remember what you said to me?<eos> No, I don't.

Jesus...<eos> FBI!<eos> No...<eos> Where's your husband?<eos> Betty, where's Phil?<eos> I don't know!<eos> He left with...<eos> With the hit man he hired.<eos> We know everything.<eos> No, you don't.
And while you're at it, try to grow some opium.<eos> W-With this? Uh-huh. It's a poppy seed bagel.<eos> Yeah. You got a lot of bagel scraping to do.<eos> I want you working till sundown.<eos> See ya.<eos> See how I'm doing on Farmer.<eos> Ooh.<eos> I got a love sprout.<eos> "Want to meet up?"<eos> Yes, I do.
I figured you for a mama's boy.<eos> One slap, and you spit out the info.<eos> It's been a good run, kid.<eos> Now, let's just get to the end.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> You win.<eos> Nobody treats me like that and lives.<eos> Do you even know who the hell I am?<eos> Do you?
Thing is, you can't go with me.<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> No, this is the end of the road.<eos> I've put your lives in too much danger already.<eos> And this cabin, if you go there, you'd end up possessed and I would have to kill you both and cut your heads off and that would just be bad everybody.<eos> No.<eos> I want payback.<eos> You don't get to take that away from me. Yeah.<eos> We knew what we were getting into when we joined up with you...<eos> Well, no we didn't. Not even a little bit.
Oh.<eos> Enjoy them while they're hot.<eos> Oh, your needle.<eos> I suppose we should discuss the poison.<eos> Poison?<eos> You're not the first Castithan concubine that has attempted to murder me.<eos> Your people know nothing about my physiology, and that's exactly the way I like it.<eos> I have lived for many, many centuries, and the longer my people live, the more difficult we are to kill.<eos> So why do you want me dead?<eos> Actually, I don't.
Freddie, Stuart, can I ask you something?<eos> Did you guys like Theo better than me because he was gay?<eos> Ash!<eos> You think everybody is gay.<eos> We didn't like him better than you, dear.<eos> Of course not.<eos> We were just being nice to him for the discount.<eos> You're our Ash.<eos> Don't you know that by now?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Roll up his sleeve, guy.<eos> - Don't do it.<eos> - With pleasure.<eos> Hey, uh, take it from me.<eos> You could save yourself a lot of pain and misery, and you could save us a lot of time if you would just open up that mouth of yours and start talking.<eos> Well, what do you want me to say?<eos> Just tell me what you want me to say, and I'll say it.<eos> Colby was an informant.<eos> You tried to get him to be an informant.<eos> Yes, I did.
So you just want to stop opening that door.<eos> So you just sit in it.<eos> But I assure you, one of those doors leads out, my friend.<eos> I don't have any friends.<eos> Get to know me.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna kill you.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because I have to clear.<eos> See, that's the thing.<eos> You don't.
Yeah.<eos> I'm not gonna have to fuck him, am I?<eos> No.<eos> You don't have to fuck him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So... Now what?<eos> He wants to see you fight.<eos> But I thought he loved me.<eos> He does.
This is crazy.<eos> That's enough.<eos> This is our wedding cake.<eos> This is our cake.<eos> - Sarah, this is our cake.<eos> - Tammy...<eos> Remember we went to that sweet little shop in Venice and we tried, like, 12 different cakes?<eos> Remember, honey, we fell in love with this? Sarah, okay? Just calm down.<eos> - I have a beautiful soul.<eos> - Yes, you do.

He's back...<eos> he's back up.<eos> Is that right?<eos> What's he on about?<eos> Yah!<eos> Finish it!<eos> - Nice.<eos> - Got it now.<eos> - Come on, do it, Maddox.<eos> - Just do it!
- And I should blame myself.<eos> Well, I do.<eos> I blame myself.<eos> I'm the last person who walked away and left her here to live like this.<eos> Happy?<eos> Hey.<eos> I left her first.<eos> She was depending on me, and I got on that bus, and I left her here.<eos> So I know how you feel.<eos> [Crying] No, you don't.
[Sighs] You want to drink water.<eos> Lots of it.<eos> Listen, I need to tell you something.<eos> I know that what you did it wasn't easy.<eos> And I was wrong to make out like it was.<eos> I was just hanging on to the smallest possible hope, you know, but... You knew... you knew that... even if she survived that... she wouldn't...<eos> she wouldn't be living.<eos> God, she'd hate that.<eos> I think you made the right decision.<eos> I do.
- I know it's not what you want to hear, but I need you with me on this.<eos> I need you beside me.<eos> I can't do it on my own.<eos> How can you ask me that?<eos> How can you ask me?<eos> You shut me out?<eos> You go against my wishes here?<eos> It's not easy, Deacon, but we have to let her go.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
I was sworn to...<eos> Our daughter is sick.<eos> We're at the hospital.<eos> Now, I need some way to get in touch with my damn wife!<eos> Tell me what you'd like to feel.<eos> I don't want to feel anything.<eos> I don't want to think.<eos> I don't even want to dream.<eos> You got something for that?<eos> I do.
Okay, Jeff's gone, he's not coming back, and the best way for you to get over him is to just pretend that the two of you never happened.<eos> What?<eos> That was great advice.<eos> That's pretty.<eos> Noel had the stylist send over a few things for the tour.<eos> What are those?<eos> An apology.<eos> For being overly sensitive about the tour last night.<eos> - You don't have to say anything about that.<eos> - I do. I do.
- Mm. It sucks here without you.<eos> The last 12 hours have been painful.<eos> Oh, come on. Is it really that bad?<eos> Hey, how mad was your mom when you got home?<eos> Pretty mad.<eos> I mean, she grounded me for getting onstage, if you can believe that.<eos> She doesn't know, does she?<eos> What?<eos> That I love you?<eos> No, she doesn't.
... getting some feedback.<eos> Hey, girls.<eos> Hey. Y'all know that Boulevard song you sang at the talent show?<eos> How'd you feel about singing that for Markus right now?<eos> Wait... they're gonna sing my song?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want you to hear what I heard.<eos> Oh. So now you want me to sing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.

There's nothing for us to be fighting about.<eos> However, if he cancels this tour, this album is dead!<eos> Everything, all the hard work, is pointless, so, yes, I'm going to go talk to Markus right now!<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I'm Dr. Kitley, your wife's therapist.<eos> I'd like a few minutes of your time.<eos> I'm sorry you found out the way you did.<eos> There's probably not a good way to find out Juliette's trying to worm her way back into our lives.<eos> You do know that she signed away her parental rights.<eos> I do.
Thermal scan shows two warm bodies, which means our potential for scandal has just increased. Ooh.<eos> In the meantime... bam.<eos> Now it's a proper stakeout.<eos> Did you at least get us coffee?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You stole this from Simon, didn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
You really need to stop talking right now.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, your standing as an agent in the Bureau is finished.<eos> The Assistant Director actually had us surveilling her for an assignment.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You just blew your own op with Alex.<eos> Alex, wait!<eos> Alex!<eos> Alex!<eos> Do you like the tea?<eos> I... Yeah, I do.
I have boundaries until I know I can trust someone.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Look, uh... I should probably go.<eos> You don't have to... to do that.<eos> I know.<eos> - ♪ Cicadas and gulls ♪ - But I want to. ♪ They scrape on the hull ♪<eos> Why are your clothes still on?

Okay.<eos> Nimah's swapping back in.<eos> Alley door.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I knew you were right, B.T. Dubs, about that bomb being fake.<eos> No, you didn't.
If you'd just come with us.<eos> Haas, you, too.<eos> Sit on that bench and take a look at the file.<eos> If I see anyone that looks like a terrorist, I promise I'll let you tackle 'em.<eos> Two minutes, okay?<eos> Okay, everybody stay together.<eos> If you have all of your stuff, we're gonna head over to the National...<eos> Hey, does anyone have eyes on the guy with the tweed blazer?<eos> I think he's one of the suspects they showed us.<eos> Oh, you do?
- Let's check with Allison.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> Hey, honey, Graham wants to take us out to dinner tonight.<eos> Get away from all the craziness.<eos> Actually, can we do tomorrow night?<eos> Tonight we've got dinner with that woman from DeGraaf's.<eos> Roxanna Whitman.<eos> Do you know her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
The way he did, that's your problem. Not mine.<eos> I need that mask back. Right now.<eos> You should bounce while you can, Tommy.<eos> Look, if I don't get that mask back, people a lot more dangerous than me are going to come for it.<eos> Who's coming?<eos> Your badass art buddies going to come rough us up?<eos> Don't underestimate people with money.<eos> 'Cause they hire guys to do what they can't.<eos> I don't got it no more.<eos> Well, who does?
Who do you want to win, the government or us?<eos> There is no us.<eos> I'm here on behalf of DeGraaf's.<eos> Do you really want to see that couple break up?<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Do you expect me to believe you actually care about them?<eos> I care about the account, and we're running out of time.<eos> Do you have anything useful?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - No, you don't.
Some inbred Civil War general who smells like the woods after a storm?<eos> - You are out of control.<eos> - And you like it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I do.<eos> Clara!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Why would you think it was okay to take a photo of my son in an anti-vaccination onesie?<eos> But I thought you said you wanted him to be famous.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Well you never know what the future holds.<eos> I mean, if something was to happen, you'd be able to run this place by yourself, right?<eos> Easy?<eos> - Run the practice alone?<eos> - Sure.<eos> [chuckles] Why?<eos> Say we were to have another kid, Mindy would probably stop working.<eos> Oh, you don't say.<eos> I wasn't aware that Mindy wanted any more children.<eos> Oh, we do.
Who will be the mentor who inspires me to greatness?<eos> - Could I see everyone... Uh... [clears throat] Pardon my muffin.<eos> Could I see everyone for a quick meeting in the conference room?<eos> Dr. Lahiri.<eos> - You did very good for your first...<eos> I like to keep the seat next to me empty so it's easy for me to get away.<eos> at least I know now who my workplace nemesis is.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I hope you all had a very nice weekend.<eos> I sure did.
It's a C-section.<eos> - Dr. Lahiri delivered that baby an hour ago.<eos> - Dr. Lahiri?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> Did you impersonate Dr. Reed and do my surgery for me?<eos> how did your therapy session go?<eos> Did Christina show up?<eos> - No.<eos> man.<eos> - She didn't.
She was really happy.<eos> doy. you can wrestle a baby right out of that if you have meaty enough hands.<eos> Which I do.<eos> I'm sorry about what I said.<eos> I think you might actually be better than the guy we were meant to hire.<eos> - Thanks. - Yeah.<eos> - And I'm sorry that I said<eos> I know why your wife can't stand you.<eos> - You never said that.<eos> - I didn't?
I look forward to meeting him someday.<eos> We'll return in a moment.<eos> Simmons?<eos> Why are you looking at that?<eos> Trying to understand.<eos> There's nothing to learn from this.<eos> It's possible it's not inert.<eos> Alien metals have different properties.<eos> We don't know for sure.<eos> Yes, we do.
£300 this week.<eos> Somebody has been busy.<eos> I worked overtime.<eos> You work too hard, Quentina.<eos> You need to enjoy life more.<eos> £200 just for you. £200?<eos> I've had to increase my commission, I'm afraid.<eos> If you don't like it, you can have it paid into your own bank account.<eos> You know I cannot.<eos> Yes, I do.
Even if she is, Rio isn't.<eos> He's played this thing pretty well so far.<eos> There's no way he would let her know where he is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's riding around L.A. in a convertible like a tourist.<eos> Is he?<eos> Or is he meeting contacts at places where it's just very easy to blend in?<eos> Might've planned this whole thing out.<eos> I doubt he planned on getting arrested in Singapore.<eos> Nobody does.
It's over, Rio.<eos> My name is Jesse Reyes!<eos> Yeah?<eos> And I'm Molly Ringwald! Open the door, Rio.<eos> That's not my name!<eos> Well, it's one of 'em. I'll give you each fifty thousand dollars!<eos> We're federal agents!<eos> Okay, how about, uh, a hundred thousand dollars each?<eos> Open the door! I have a gun.<eos> No, you don't.
I had to wash my face.<eos> Hard to breathe... here.<eos> I know you framed terry colby.<eos> I-I didn't.<eos> Your father worked at Evil Corp before he died.<eos> That's a matter of public record.<eos> I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> I don't even have proof, and even if I did, I don't care.<eos> Just wanted to know your weakness.<eos> Now I do.
That leaves you with a zero-sum game.<eos> If you don't get him out of jail, he'll have you killed for failing.<eos> Only way this works in your favor is for you to kill him first, and you can't do that with him inside anymore.<eos> Shut up, motherfucker.<eos> - Shut the fuckup. - Let me free him.<eos> When I break Vera out tonight, you do with your brother what you want.<eos> That's the only outcome where you got the possibility of living.<eos> It's your best move.<eos> What makes you think I still won't kill you afterwards?<eos> I don't.
And Daddy hated you too, because you made him miserable.<eos> And that's why he killed himself.<eos> Don't you ever lay your hands on me again.<eos> I'm sorry you had to see that.<eos> You know, I've been punched.<eos> I've been kicked.<eos> I've been spit on by girls before, and I always manage to keep it together.<eos> - But, you know, my own daughter...<eos> - You don't have to explain.<eos> Yeah, I do, okay?
What if I'm not as good as you thought I was?<eos> Then it's on us to work harder and get you where you need to be.<eos> Now go find Alvey.<eos> He's around here somewhere.<eos> He'll take you through your day.<eos> He's good at it.<eos> Whole fucking night, man.<eos> Whole fucking night to showcase Alicia.<eos> Meanwhile, I got a real fucking fight going on.<eos> You... we both do.
I want you to kick the shit out of this chick.<eos> I want you to knock her the fuck out.<eos> You understand me?<eos> Control her head.<eos> Control her head.<eos> I think we should take it easy for a little while.<eos> - Let's just keep it chill.<eos> - Whatever you want.<eos> I got a real fucking fight going on.<eos> We both do.
Forget it.<eos> We're brothers, remember?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Better?<eos> Yeah, a little.<eos> You know, I think I am.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> What're you going to do down here?<eos> I have an interview tomorrow.<eos> You do?
Your mom made me watch her. She just said no one was in here.<eos> I should get some pants.<eos> So can I ask you a hockey question?<eos> It's a game played on skates and the object is to get the puck into the net.<eos> - It's kind of simple.<eos> - No.<eos> The game against the Canucks when you were robbed of the hat trick?<eos> That's because Horvat tripped you, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah. Nobody saw that.<eos> I did.
It should be the other one.<eos> Her treacherous slatch already droops like wet clay.<eos> Leave me.<eos> You are never to go to that room.<eos> You have made that more than clear.<eos> But the steward needed vellum and demanded I retrieve it.<eos> Aiden, you have no reason to fear.<eos> Your devotion is between you and your God.<eos> This secret does not hold us.<eos> Secrets never do.
- Can you not speak?<eos> - Yes, uhm... - Yes, I can.<eos> - I can't hear you. Come here.<eos> I'm so sorry to disturb you, Madam Lehmann.<eos> Well. You know my name, so might I know yours?<eos> Agathe.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> It will never happen again.<eos> Do you like Schubert?<eos> Yes, I... I do.
Will you hand me one of those cuvettes over there?<eos> - Uh, which one?<eos> - The-the square tube with the lid on it.<eos> I didn't hate the patients.<eos> I just... hated their pain.<eos> Their tears.<eos> And their families' tears.<eos> You shut down your emotions for long enough, you don't want to spend all day with somebody else's.<eos> Does it bother you when I talk about my mother?<eos> It did.
What do you need, Mina?<eos> Jorge, is it possible for you to play back Just the last 30 seconds of the meeting?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Great.<eos> I'm gonna see if we can trigger another seizure.<eos> Now, I'll have this Ativan ready to stop it, if I need to, but I want to return to exactly what was happening When you last seized.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're ready.<eos> That does not look like a momentary lapse.<eos> No, it doesn't.
I'm not some fragile thing, and I really didn't want the first person after to know, and then have a bunch of baggage about it, because it's my baggage and I'm dealing with it.<eos> _<eos> I do enjoy being with you.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I wanna stay.<eos> _<eos> Positive.<eos> I have those feelings too sometimes.<eos> You do?
Frazier Park, one hour.<eos> If she sees me, she'll call the cops.<eos> Of course.<eos> Tell her yes.<eos> I'll go.<eos> She'll be there.<eos> - Why me?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - But you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
~ The exhaust is blown completely.<eos> But what is genuinely staggering is this cost me 14,000 pence.<eos> Yes...<eos> A replacement clutch for a Vauxhall Frontera is around about £300-£400.<eos> So I have got here a half-price clutch with an entire car thrown in for free and MOT'd and taxed.<eos> Yeah, but, the entire car is a Vauxhall Frontera.<eos> Yeah, you are left with a...<eos> What?<eos> Look, for 140 quid, I wouldn't care if it said "dog dirt" on the grille.<eos> It pretty much does.
- We need money.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Dad left.<eos> - What do you mean, just gone?<eos> He left. And Mom wants to go find Dad in American states.<eos> And we need money for boat tickets and a bribe for the visas.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This shit is fascinating.<eos> Did you know there is such a thing as inherited trauma in your actual DNA?<eos> No, I did not.
I just never thought it'd be you.<eos> I never knew why you married me.<eos> I was never as... kind and empathetic as you.<eos> That's why it was so easy for me to walk away why I gave up on you.<eos> I lost something when I left you.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> But you have to stop this.<eos> Melinda...<eos> How'd you know that wouldn't kill him?<eos> I didn't.
What do you think we should do about it?<eos> For now... let's just watch the sunrise.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I never thought I deserved this.<eos> - What, a trip to Hawaii?<eos> - No.<eos> Happiness.<eos> This kind of happiness.<eos> Of course you do.
For now... let's just watch the sunrise.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I never thought I deserved this.<eos> - What, a trip to Hawaii?<eos> - No.<eos> Happiness.<eos> This kind of happiness.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> - We both do. - Mm.
Chandler into his backyard, and he ran.<eos> I-I... he's ashamed.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Don't make him feel like a coward.<eos> Lieutenant, will you let Andy know about this?<eos> [ Folder thuds ] Before I continue the investigation into the Fifth Dynasty,<eos> I need to discuss what may be some... relevant legal work... in which Chandler was involved.<eos> What the...<eos> This has nothing at all to do with the Fifth Dynasty.<eos> No, it doesn't.
There's no good way to bury a child.<eos> Man: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Mariana Wallace, rest in peace.<eos> Amen.<eos> Man: Detail, right turn!<eos> Exit.<eos> You okay, Gus?<eos> [ Voice breaking ] I-I appreciate very much being able to lay Mariana to rest like this.<eos> But I just feel it's unfair, making me agree not to meet with Paloma till she's 18.<eos> Do you want Paloma to lose everything that she has, Gus?<eos> No. No, I don't.
Gino, I'm trying to solve our problems by finding more hours in the day.<eos> And you brought the problem here.<eos> Why are you being like this?<eos> It's a horse for a mansion, not a farmer's horse.<eos> Well, you didn't marry a farmer.<eos> You married me, and I'm doing my best.<eos> Don't you remember what you said to me?<eos> You said that you don't want me to be like your mamma.<eos> Not, tied to the kitchen sink in an apron, working my fingers to the bone, but somehow I think, that is exactly what you want.<eos> No, I don't.
But if Parry's telling the truth, then...<eos> Ryan had gone rogue.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You never even knew about that house.<eos> He kept that from you, the pills from you, maybe other secrets too.<eos> ~ Why are you doing this?<eos> ~ To help you to see who he really was properly.<eos> ~ You were supposed to be his friend.<eos> ~ Well, I didn't know him very well.<eos> None of us did.
Thank you.<eos> Actually, Jo, there was something I came to say.<eos> I can't give the eulogy at Ryan's funeral.<eos> Why?<eos> To do that would be to say in public that I had complete faith in him.<eos> But there are still doubts over his conduct.<eos> ~ From whom?<eos> ~ I can't go into that.<eos> If you don't speak at his funeral, you're judging him without knowing the whole story.<eos> None of us do.
Ah, what the heck?<eos> Congratulations, Milhouse.<eos> You made it through adolescence and you're cuter than ever.<eos> Oh, sweet Lisa!<eos> You know I had a rocky childhood with all the rocks they threw at me.<eos> You're the most amazing thing at this party.<eos> Well, excuse me!<eos> I'm not even the best Simpson at my best friend's party!<eos> Do you know what it's like to be second-best at anything?<eos> Yeah, I do!
Now come.<eos> He wants you.<eos> No.<eos> A mother knows her son.<eos> And he will know you.<eos> You do not understand.<eos> You have never understood.<eos> The holy marriage of heaven and earth is wasted on an ignorant and ungrateful peasant girl!<eos> You want him.<eos> I do not.
My dear Isaac.<eos> Isaac.<eos> Isaac.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it.<eos> That ain't Dollie.<eos> There will be no more of your foul magic here!<eos> Who says so?<eos> I do.
- What? He wanted to come here because he smokes joints.<eos> - Damiani!<eos> - Borghini, what are you doing here?<eos> I can't believe it, you're in Amsterdam too, how nice!<eos> Leopoldo, my father-in-law.<eos> This is Leopoldo Borghini, from my club, the funniest pharmacist in the world.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> - Charmed.<eos> - Hi. - We know each other.<eos> We do?
Sit down.<eos> It's your fault too, ordering mussels in Amsterdam!<eos> You stuffed yourself! Let me feel your heartbeat.<eos> The jugular vein, feel it.<eos> "When Beatrice I saw turned toward her left, and looking at the sun; no eagle ever gazed at it so keenly..."<eos> Damiani!<eos> - What are you thinking about?<eos> - Giulia.<eos> What's Giulia got to do with Dante's Paradise?<eos> Sorry, nothing at all to do with it.
- It's an apology.<eos> Well, and it's an admission of guilt.<eos> You know, if you were Avery, would you want to hear anything that Darius has to say right now?<eos> My son got the crap kicked out of him when he was a boy just for being gay.<eos> No one ever apologized to him.<eos> Darius McCrae wrote something for me?<eos> He did.<eos> He wanted to apologize.<eos> You don't have to read it if you don't want to.<eos> No, I do.
Check for what?<eos> Hand nodules! Check for hand nodules!<eos> Okay, why are you yelling? You know that makes me flustered.<eos> Highlight the joints.<eos> Bang.<eos> Rheumatoid arthritis. Those hot spots you see are nodules -- very early signs of disease.<eos> Arthur had vulnerable blood vessels.<eos> So, what are you saying? I'm saying that, had he fired a 9-millimeter weapon,<eos> I'd see discoloration in his skin.<eos> I do not.
Apparently not, because he's here.<eos> Send him away.<eos> Tell Halima to get him out of the city.<eos> He-he cannot be here.<eos> He can't know who I am.<eos> I realize this isn't how you intended this to happen.<eos> But he's come all this way and he's got the money that we need.<eos> What money?<eos> He doesn't have any money.<eos> Yes, he does.
Timing?<eos> Timing, yes.<eos> Timing is everything.<eos> Well, timing and information.<eos> Knowing what is going to happen before it happens.<eos> That is... that is the ultimate good luck.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> So, you helped, uh, with the mission yesterday.<eos> So you knew which families, which houses, were going to be visited and at what time.<eos> Apparently, so did the Red Hand.
- Yeah, that's Distant Star Pathfinder.<eos> It was the program NASA was in the middle of when Roz and I... joined.<eos> We weren't privy to the details.<eos> - You know where NASA was running it?<eos> - They weren't.<eos> An independent contractor proposed the project, ran things out of a lab complex.<eos> Facility shut down years ago.<eos> Maybe worth looking anyway.<eos> Do we have to guess who it was that funded this independent contractor?<eos> No, you don't.
And who the hell is that?<eos> - Mr. Tull's therapist.<eos> - What?<eos> A therapist can't testify against their own patient.<eos> She can if we paid for it and he signed a waiver, which he did.<eos> Mr. Tull, your therapist's testimony is coming, and when it does, your ability to cut a deal goes away.<eos> Drop this matter, and no one ever knows you saw a therapist at all.<eos> You went to see a company-provided therapist, and you never told me?<eos> I didn't think it mattered.<eos> Well, it goddamn does.
She's not gonna want to help us.<eos> It's not about helping us.<eos> It's about helping her client.<eos> I can't ask her to do that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I can't.<eos> - Harvey, what's going on?<eos> - Nothing's going on.<eos> How did you know those things about her in that deposition?<eos> Because I did.
I did.<eos> And I shouldn't have been so standoffish with you in the file room.<eos> Well, maybe I shouldn't have had that be our first interaction.<eos> No, that's not on you.<eos> That's on me.<eos> I never welcomed you to the firm, and I should have.<eos> You know, when I was a young mother, first week of school, every day I dropped my little girl off.<eos> When I left, she cried.<eos> Friday came, I left, she didn't cry.<eos> So I did.
Nobody loves the bright lights more than me<eos> The spotlight is a prize<eos> You gotta be ready<eos> You're a phony<eos> You're no Catty<eos> Take a catwalk<eos> Nice try kitty cat, with the voice-jack<eos> I've got friends looking out They've got my back<eos> Now you know, stealing the show is a crime<eos> Unless you do it right
That's not what I see.<eos> You're not looking hard enough.<eos> Want to spark it?<eos> Shit.<eos> Gusti.<eos> Hey, why are we hiding?<eos> He doesn't approve of this.<eos> You cannot do this.<eos> Okay, Toros wants you dead.<eos> Yes, Toros does.
Nothing. ♪ ♪<eos> I never remember my dreams.<eos> I wasn't dreaming.<eos> Got some strange stuff in here.<eos> - Like wacko strange.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It looks crazy, but...<eos> I was desperate to get down what I was thinking, you know, to make sense of it, to not forget what I saw when I was... wherever I was.<eos> You know you didn't see anything, right?<eos> Yes, I did.
- Yeah.<eos> Secretly, I liked it, but next time, I don't know, maybe, uh, maybe not so rough.<eos> I can't make any promises.<eos> You like a powerful man?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think I'm gonna be running everything that has to do with the Sarkissian family.<eos> It's going to be mine to manage.<eos> And I'm thinking a great man can use a beautiful woman by his side.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> I do.
This place we found for you is anonymous.<eos> No work, no pressure.<eos> You can just... You can go tonight.<eos> I gotta finish the case, Charlie.<eos> No, baby, you gotta get well.<eos> You gotta get well.<eos> You gotta be ready to quit this shit.<eos> And I'm ready.<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> I don't.
Husband.<eos> Husband.<eos> Violet.<eos> Hello, darling.<eos> I have something to tell you and then I'll be off.<eos> Is everything OK?<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Nothing happened between us.<eos> It didn't?
I also scraped my shoulder if you want to see that, too.<eos> Where were you Monday at 3:00?<eos> I was at my house waiting for my girlfriend.<eos> We thought Jordan was your fiance.<eos> We postponed the wedding so she could, like, look for another job in case that Palmer prick ends up getting rid of her.<eos> Okay, so, you do know him?<eos> 'Cause a minute ago...<eos> I think silent Sam was better off not speaking.<eos> Why did you lie to us, sir?<eos> I didn't.
Well, at least I did until you started working here.<eos> Whatever.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I actually really need to talk to someone about something that you're kind of an expert in.<eos> - Real estate?<eos> - No.<eos> One-night stands.<eos> I had my first one last night. Ha ha ha ha! Oh, man!<eos> I remember my first one-night stand.<eos> No, I don't.
It comes, then it goes.<eos> I'm hot, then I'm cold.<eos> I'm like a walking Katy Perry song.<eos> When you say you get this way sometimes, what do you mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Probably just tired.<eos> Nate?<eos> Headachy, fevery.<eos> You want to examine me, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
She's okay.<eos> We like some of the same stuff.<eos> Like what?<eos> I played her some music, and she was into it.<eos> - What did you play?<eos> - Yaz. - What song?<eos> - "Only You."<eos> Did your dad teach you that move?<eos> He said it always works.<eos> Did with me.
Are you?<eos> Regina. Hey.<eos> No one knows the lure of darkness better than I do.<eos> You can lie to your parents, you can lie to yourself.<eos> But you can't lie to me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Feels good, doesn't it?<eos> Indulging every impulse, wielding great power, doing whatever you want.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
That you can't ignite the Promethean Flame because you're afraid to take the plunge and move in with me?<eos> It's... everything.<eos> When I told you I loved you back in Storybrooke, it was because I thought I was never going to see you again.<eos> It was the same way with Neal.<eos> I could only admit my true feelings when I thought I was losing him... and you.<eos> Well, I guess it's even worse than I thought.<eos> You can't even see any future at all with me.<eos> That's not it. Don't you get it?<eos> I'm afraid because I do want a future with you.<eos> - You do?
It's a good thing I happen to have some then.<eos> What?<eos> You've got magic?<eos> No.<eos> My hook does.<eos> As you recall, I imbued it with magic to rip your heart out.<eos> Well, go on, then. What are you waiting for?<eos> The last time I tried helping you, you betrayed me.<eos> - How do I know I can trust you now?<eos> - You don't.
I don't... I don't know.<eos> I was having a bad day.<eos> I just wanted to get high.<eos> So you made a mistake.<eos> Why lie about Rita?<eos> Because if I said that Brooke hit me, then she would have told.<eos> And if I test positive for drugs at any time during the application process, then that's it.<eos> You can never join the army.<eos> So, you have other options.<eos> No, I don't.
You send the notification over to Tanner?<eos> Two hours ago.<eos> Then it won't be long.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't say anything about your state of mind after Tim Petroff because I wasn't worried about it then,<eos> - but I am now.<eos> - Mike--<eos> - What if it doesn't work?<eos> - It'll work.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
Oh, are those for me?<eos> Please sign here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I wonder who these are from.<eos> "To Holly, from Eric, just because."<eos> I noticed on Facebook that they were your favorite.<eos> Oh, that's so thoughtful.<eos> See, most men wouldn't know what to send.<eos> But you know what I like.<eos> Yes, yes I do.
ABBIE: The Shard of Anubis?<eos> That's a pretty fancy name.<eos> You never suspected it had any value?<eos> Honestly, I had no idea anyone cared about the damn thing.<eos> Until you had to trade it for Joe Corbin's life.<eos> He overheard things about me, about his dad.<eos> He's not about to let that go.<eos> Well, can you blame him?<eos> All of a sudden, he finds out he really didn't know half of what the man was up to.<eos> But you did.
Not the last death.<eos> Look.<eos> Burial records show that 29 souls were lost in that spring and summer.<eos> All taken by<eos> Yellow fever.<eos> All of them students at Eton College.<eos> I was not summoned home because of the Ripper killings.<eos> It was to protect me from infection.<eos> You had no idea about the outbreak?<eos> No, none of us did.
Gustav, let's go.<eos> Yeah, about that, Hiccup.<eos> I've been treated much better by these guys than I ever was treated by you and the Dragon Riders.<eos> [laughs] Ooh! And the plot thickens.<eos> Gustav?<eos> You could've given me a chance, you know?<eos> All you guys ever did was tell me I wasn't good enough, tell me I didn't belong.<eos> Well, I belong here.<eos> Gustav, you have no idea what you're getting into!<eos> Oh, yes, I do, Hiccup.
Bull's-eye.<eos> Fishlegs, stop it!<eos> Come here!<eos> My girl, we're just hanging out.<eos> Well, well, well, I didn't think it was possible... what with you being all "you" and all, but you're actually ready.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> I knew you were up to something.<eos> Fishlegs, have you been training to take on the Quaken?<eos> - You don't have to answer that.<eos> - Oh, yes, he does. Fishlegs?
I know that.<eos> Person-to-person, just do this for me once.<eos> Can't you think of it as giving a gift?<eos> Just once.<eos> Hey, clean the dishes properly!<eos> - Hurry up, Na Bong.<eos> - No...<eos> Chef, please just once.<eos> I'm asking you.<eos> - Do the dishes...
You are wet, Arseling.<eos> I am.<eos> We're at tide.<eos> But I have a plan.<eos> Lord.<eos> The ships are guarded by no more than 60 men.<eos> The rest of the army will be inland looking for food.<eos> We kill the men, we burn the ships.<eos> And you really believe Scorpa will then go to Guthrum?<eos> I do.
Beck, what are you doing here?<eos> I left her.<eos> For good.<eos> From my personal collection.<eos> Perhaps you can wear them to the opening of Parliament.<eos> You realize that you're stalking me?<eos> What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> 'She needs to be controlled.<eos> They both do.'
I'm sorry about that. I guess I hit the wrong guy.<eos> Hell yeah, you did.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Not really.<eos> I think we just broke up.<eos> Riley, everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Ross is just some guy you dated.<eos> He's not the one.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.
Because we'll always stab you in the back.<eos> No.<eos> Santanico, por favor.<eos> I've waited a thousand years for this.<eos> All I ever wanted was to live in eternity with you.<eos> Is that so wrong?<eos> I have all the possessions in the world.<eos> But you were never a possession.<eos> I always cherished you.<eos> I still do.
Oh, then, please, Niklaus...<eos> Make me like you.<eos> You've had a thousand birthdays since.<eos> If I forgot to send a card, it's because I forgot about you.<eos> Is that why you're here, to remind me?<eos> I am here for the same reason Lucien and Tristan are... to protect my sire.<eos> Now, if you turned me that night like I'd asked, I would be here to protect you, but since you didn't, I need to know where in the hell is Rebekah?<eos> Elijah.<eos> I didn't realize we had a meeting on the books today.<eos> We don't.
You do know I was cleared of suspicion by real detectives, yet you hound me.<eos> Why is that?<eos> It's my job to read people, and you aren't that hard to read.<eos> Ha! Now, on that, we disagree.<eos> One thing we can agree on, this delicate, little theater between us does need to reach a conclusion, so...<eos> How do we end it?<eos> Heh. If you hurt me, I know a certain someone who won't react very well.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> You think because you know someone like Klaus, you know someone like me?<eos> Well, you don't.
In yourself?<eos> But... so does that mean I'm off the hook?<eos> Dre, I hate guns more than I hate how Levi's fit me.<eos> And I know I don't want guns anywhere near my children, all right?<eos> But somehow I panicked, okay?<eos> And that is how people wind up shot.<eos> That is exactly why we shouldn't have a gun in the house.<eos> Babe, I get it.<eos> And I shouldn't want one, either, especially after what just happened.<eos> But I do.
To dance with my father again<eos> When I was young<eos> He would lift me up<eos> Ha ha! I got it!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> So, pops is circling the drain.<eos> No, mom and webmd say balloon angioplasties are easy.<eos> Balloon?<eos> I want a balloon.<eos> Not in your heart, you don't.
Mmm.<eos> Death by pork... a warrior's death.<eos> Good morning, everybody!<eos> Real bacon.<eos> And And pancakes?<eos> Ruby, I told you I don't like the kids eating a sugary breakfast on a school day.<eos> Since when is Thursday a school day?<eos> Besides, I have a right to spoil my grandbabies.<eos> Now, who wants ice cream?<eos> - I do!
That's just in case.<eos> All right, I'll see you when we land.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Zoey and I are sitting in first class.<eos> This ain't my first rodeo.<eos> Moop! Okay, and listen.<eos> So, we left enough food in the fridge, right?<eos> Did we put the lights on a timer?<eos> And did you call Charlotte, like I asked?<eos> - You did?
Geez.<eos> - You all right? - Uh-huh!<eos> What are you doing, Rick?<eos> I'm pretty sure the battery's dead.<eos> Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?<eos> Well, let's see.<eos> Hey, wait-- huh?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> But Zeep did.
Apart from cause trouble.<eos> - Cos you sure don't help.<eos> - Please, Bella, let me explain.<eos> You're different.<eos> Something's changed.<eos> You're going to have to get used to seeing me like this, Bella.<eos> As Dr Jekyll.<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't want Jekyll.<eos> Right now, I want Hyde.<eos> Everybody does.
I'm not bullshitting you."<eos> He said...<eos> He said, "Now, listen, if you're black, you should really hear this."<eos> And black people were like, "What? What is it?"<eos> "The Republicans are trying to bring back slavery,<eos> I swear to God!<eos> I'm not lying to you!"<eos> He know how to rattle us.<eos> "Vote for Barack, I bullshit you not.<eos> Do it.
I'm Alex.<eos> -Wanda.<eos> -And I'm BoJack.<eos> It's been really tough for me these last few weeks.<eos> I've never seen Home Alone and everyone makes me feel like a freak because of it.<eos> -You've never seen Home Alone?<eos> -I've never seen it!<eos> -Also, I don't really know what a DVR is.<eos> -Neither do I!<eos> -No one does.
But I'm my own dog.<eos> And as my own dog, I decided to forgive BoJack live on the air!<eos> Bring it in, buddy! - What? - Really?<eos> Mr. Peanutbutter, I applaud your forgiving nature, but this guy kissed your wife.<eos> Wait, BoJack kissed Diane?<eos> The only way to even the score is if you get to kiss him.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - You're right, it makes perfect sense.<eos> - Yeah, absolutely.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
- Okay.<eos> - Tomorrow.<eos> - Charlotte...<eos> I have worked very hard to build this life for myself.<eos> I am happy here.<eos> And you just roll into my life like a hurricane.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we knew each other for five minutes 30 years ago?<eos> - I don't know you.<eos> - You do. I don't.
We just go down to the... cafeteria on her break.<eos> - About the bus driver, sir?<eos> - Right, I'm getting to that.<eos> My wife only gets 45 minutes for dinner, and if I don't get there right at 8:00,<eos> - we don't get to have dinner...<eos> - Alicia, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> You don't ask open-ended questions.<eos> You ask yes or no questions and only about bail.<eos> - Yeah, but I need to know his story.<eos> - No, you don't.
DUI?<eos> You okay?<eos> I had six clients; four are still behind bars.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We're not in the miracle-working business.<eos> It's an assembly line.<eos> Keep the court moving... that's all.<eos> Here's the other thing.<eos> You didn't make any money today.<eos> Yes, I did.
You would spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder, never knowing when Zoom is coming.<eos> Okay. And what's your great idea?<eos> How were you supposed to contact him after you killed me?<eos> I was supposed to get something... something I could only get if you were dead... and then throw it through the breach as proof.<eos> - And then what?<eos> - Then he'd come for me.<eos> Confirm the kill and bring me home.<eos> - Why do you want to know?<eos> - Because I want to find him.<eos> You really don't.
I'm keeping my options open.<eos> I don't understand why you think we have a choice.<eos> Zoom wants me dead.<eos> The meta-humans that he's sending from Earth-2, they don't care how many innocent people get in the way.<eos> Look at what happened to Iris and Linda's boss.<eos> He was just collateral damage in Zoom's war.<eos> The next time, that could be you or Iris.<eos> I'm just wondering if going after him now is premature.<eos> I mean, we barely know anything about his abilities.<eos> Wells does.
This is... this is... this is so weird.<eos> Yeah, I haven't seen you since...<eos> You-you didn't come back the next summer at camp.<eos> Oh, yeah, my mom made me do mock trial, and then I did it the next summer, so...<eos> You know, I'd always hope I'd run into you one day.<eos> I mean, we had such a good time that summer.<eos> Yeah. Uh, you probably don't even remember it.<eos> No, I remember some...<eos> I-I remember all of it, yeah. I remember all of it, yeah.<eos> Of course I do.
Yes, sir.<eos> Syphilis.<eos> You had this before?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - When?<eos> Um... some years back.<eos> I passed it on.<eos> Not knowingly.<eos> I thought it had gone.<eos> It rarely does.
Good night, ma'am.<eos> I didn't even dream last night.<eos> I was... really hoping I would, you know?<eos> I thought maybe it would...<eos> I just... Someone did this to me.<eos> Took away my whole life.<eos> And I can't do anything.<eos> I got you a coffee and a tea this morning.<eos> Which would you prefer?<eos> - I don't...
You send the notification over to Tanner?<eos> Two hours ago.<eos> Then it won't be long.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't say anything about your state of mind after Tim Petroff Because I wasn't worried about it then,<eos> - But I am now.<eos> - Mike...<eos> - What if it doesn't work?<eos> - It'll work.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
Uh, good news, I think.<eos> I've made contact with the Resistance here.<eos> What do you mean, you think?<eos> The film's been taken by the Yakuza.<eos> Go on.<eos> They're willing to sell it for 100,000 yen.<eos> Joe, if I agree to this, you guarantee that they will honor this bargain?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Joe, I need to know that you understand what I'm saying.<eos> I do, sir.
I run her.<eos> I'm her handler, nobody else.<eos> Second, you get Six to let me see all the files about who I am...<eos> Dmitry, John Cameron, all the legends.<eos> Which one of you put gun in my desk?<eos> W-What gun?<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> Yes, it was him.<eos> I have right to kill him.<eos> Yes, you do.
I've devoted my whole life to atoning for that fact.<eos> Your foundation has donated tens of millions of dollars to Muslim charities all over Europe.<eos> Also not a secret.<eos> I don't have to tell you-- there are many points at which social and terrorist causes cannot help meeting.<eos> Not in our case.<eos> We account for every cent.<eos> I take personal responsibility for that.<eos> Maybe you don't consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization.<eos> Is that a question?<eos> Yeah, it is-- do you or don't you?
We have a green light?<eos> We have a green light.<eos> However, I did neglect to mention your conversation with Etai Luskin.<eos> I'm sure you did.<eos> How detailed is their intelligence, do you think?<eos> They know Assad's in the crosshairs.<eos> They know we have a likely candidate to replace him.<eos> Screw 'em.<eos> As long as they don't know the who and the when.<eos> They don't.
I get that.<eos> I won't be involved anymore, either.<eos> You've done more than enough, Jonas.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I mean that.<eos> No one should have to live like this.<eos> I just said you don't have to.<eos> I'm not talking about me.<eos> Well, I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
Mr. Berenson.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Where's what's-his-name?<eos> Rubin, the guy analyzing the damage from the network breach.<eos> - He moved to Conference C.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Can I call for you?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How we doing on the data penetration?
You are not well enough to leave.<eos> I will talk to that crazy man.<eos> You should stay, at least one more night.<eos> I'll sleep outside the door.<eos> I'm not afraid of Hajik.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for taking care of me.<eos> You have somewhere to go, I hope?<eos> Someone to look after you?<eos> I do.
Name it.<eos> None of the hacked documents see the light of day ever again.<eos> They won't.<eos> I swear to you.<eos> Are you talking to anyone else about this?<eos> No.<eos> I told you there is no one else.<eos> I'm counting on you to do this.<eos> And I just told you I would.<eos> You did.
You said I wouldn't be arrested!<eos> ...CIA, Saul Berenson...<eos> Guarantees.<eos> Actually, it's kind of comforting.<eos> What?<eos> This.<eos> You.<eos> Following me around.<eos> I want you to know I don't believe what they're saying about you.<eos> None of us do.
We're pulling you from the field.<eos> That's a mistake.<eos> I can rehabilitate myself.<eos> Already, I've talked my way back in this far.<eos> You will never be fully trusted.<eos> And we will never fully trust the information you are given access to.<eos> Wait a minute, damn it.<eos> Take your hands off me.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
He was rounded up.<eos> And this is the best part.<eos> He'd already volunteered to help the investigation.<eos> Perhaps that's what he's doing, then, helping the BND.<eos> Then why the silence?<eos> Why can't he be reached?<eos> Remember, this man had already been illegally imprisoned once before.<eos> One could argue that in extraordinary times the state is justified in taking extraordinary measures.<eos> I used to believe that.<eos> I really did.
I swear, it had nothing to do with the color of his skin, but... I did shoot him.<eos> I deserve to be held responsible for my actions.<eos> Even if that means going to jail.<eos> You heard him, other cops.<eos> Let's take him in.<eos> He doesn't know our names, does he?<eos> I don't think he does.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Peter didn't shoot my son.<eos> I did.
Can't you see Silky is singing?<eos> Why don't you scurry on back to "The Golden Girls" convention?<eos> I don't know them!<eos> I thank you all so much!<eos> What is wrong with you people?<eos> I mean, is there anything you don't know how to ruin?<eos> Dude, what was up with that?<eos> Yeah, why didn't you tell us?<eos> Well, do you guys want the whole story?<eos> Yeah, we do.
- Not exactly.<eos> I rigged the autopilot to return to base, ma'am.<eos> And you brought them all home?<eos> According to orders, last trainee to the ship was supposed to walk.<eos> Instead, we stuck together, like the Spartans at Thermopylae.<eos> In the real ending of the story, 117, the Spartans are betrayed and slaughtered.<eos> It is their sacrifice that actually saves and unites Greece.<eos> But we had more choices.<eos> The men you hit with rocks didn't.<eos> No, sir, they did not.
But still they were fellow soldiers.<eos> People die.<eos> Sacrifice is a necessary consequence of war.<eos> But, sir, they were wasted, not spent.<eos> Because of me.<eos> Your priorities are to follow orders, and to preserve your life and the lives of your team.<eos> Is that clear, Squad Leader?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We heard what happened.<eos> Everyone on the ship did.
They'll be ages and ages.<eos> - Not walking, then?<eos> - I don't want to now.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you to feel better, I suppose.<eos> You want me to feel better?<eos> About what?<eos> Dora Cargill walloped you, ha!<eos> It must've hurt awfully.<eos> It did.
All right, so you didn't attack Tamsin Carmichael and you didn't abduct her sister, Katherine?<eos> No, we just went.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> - What?<eos> - Tamsin, sir.<eos> You haven't told me if she's all right. LEWIS GRUNTS<eos> Come on now.<eos> I've told you, please.<eos> You went for a walk, you got friendly, you got to friendly with her, she said no, you lost your temper.<eos> - No, I didn't.
It was my idea.<eos> I hate you.<eos> I don't care!<eos> You look all right!<eos> Have you seen my face?<eos> - Mummy did her best with it.<eos> - Does it hurt?<eos> - Not too bad.<eos> Why is it the only time he does it to me, it has to show?<eos> Yours never do.
- Come on.<eos> The A.G.'s office has strict protocols, Castle.<eos> You're not with the A.G.'s office anymore.<eos> I did what I did to protect you.<eos> He gave me a class seven distress code.<eos> That's life or death.<eos> I mean, what did you want me to do?<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Come on. Do you have any idea how worried I was?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's an honor to be here, especially considering all of the captains that have come before me.<eos> And if I was a poet or a best-selling novelist, then maybe I'd have a better metaphor, but, um, the 12th precinct... she's our home, our haven.<eos> And even if she is beaten down or shot up, she's still special.<eos> Because this is where we get to make a difference, and I am so privileged to be able to do just that with each and every one of you.<eos> So, that being said, stop standing around doing nothing and get back to work.<eos> Guys.<eos> I cracked the phone's encryption.<eos> The shooters received calls from only one number.<eos> - Are you able to trace it?<eos> - I already did.
And then Denver.<eos> Gonna be living out of a suitcase for the next few weeks, eating room service, watching bad reality television... you know, my life.<eos> Well, maybe I can call you sometime if I need some advice.<eos> Or to talk about "The Bachelor."<eos> I'd like that.<eos> So, do you need a lift, or are you just checking in on me?<eos> I'm happy you're alive.<eos> So, do you believe that Allison Hyde masterminded all of this?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Neither do you.
I didn't tell him you were coming.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll leave you to it then.<eos> You okay?<eos> Grandpa?<eos> You're a handsome young man.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Noah. I'm your grandson.<eos> I don't have a grandson.<eos> Yes. Yes you do.
No.<eos> No, these aren't prayers, mate.<eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Unless you want to redecorate your lovely hut with his brains, I suggest you drop your weapon.<eos> On the floor.<eos> You won't escape this island.<eos> Ah, I don't intend on leaving just yet.<eos> Come on, you.<eos> You really know the place on that map?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do?
I know this is more than a little crazy.<eos> Yeah, well, your friend with the creepy ring asked so nicely.<eos> Please tell me we're not going to negotiate with terrorists.<eos> Or, you know, 4,000 year old bad guys.<eos> Just think of this more as a fact-finding mission.<eos> Maybe Savage slips up and gives us something that we can use to our advantage.<eos> Thea said you were being a little more humorous lately.<eos> I'm sorry, how do you know so much about Savage, anyway?<eos> I don't know anything about him,<eos> Mr. Allen. No one does.
Cisco...<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> You know what, it's fine.<eos> It's cool.<eos> It's actually kind of a classic story-- boy meets girl, boy gets girl, girl sprouts wings and flies away with her reincarnated soul mate.<eos> The only part I don't get is you don't even really seem to like him.<eos> It's kind of a complicated relationship. Hmm.<eos> Like most 4,000 year old relationships are, I guess.<eos> A week ago, I was a barista and I really didn't have a plan for what I was going to do with my life.<eos> And now you do?
Hey. How we doing?<eos> It's actually a pretty great turnout.<eos> Who knew people would rather pick up garbage than celebrate the holidays, huh?<eos> Not bad for a hippie, crunchy campaign proposal, huh?<eos> Nobody likes an "I told you so."<eos> Accept apparently Star City.<eos> Your approval rating is up 10 points.<eos> I have an approval rating.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
Can I help you?<eos> It's ok.<eos> I speak mute.<eos> Just communicate what you want with a series of grunts. Ah! Ah!<eos> You'll have to excuse Beau.<eos> He's not in the mood for glib jokes.<eos> None of us are, actually.<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
He's not in the mood for glib jokes.<eos> None of us are, actually.<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.<eos> Otherwise, I would be at home, not out patrolling the streets to keep humans out of your minion's fangs.<eos> We found Malcolm in the towns square last night, his heart removed.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't because we didn't do it.
Seems I've developed, um, feelings for someone with terrible taste, and yet...<eos> I need to get something for Nora and Mary Lou's anniversary.<eos> Nora used to read this poem over and over again when we were trapped together.<eos> I believe it was called "The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd." Ah. "But could youth last and love still breed,<eos> I had no idea you enjoyed poetry.<eos> Well, there's a lot about me that you haven't... allowed yourself to know. ♪ Need some relief ♪ ♪ Sick of leaving things... ♪<eos> The poems of sir Walter Raleigh, a proper Englishman.<eos> Oh, this looks like a decent edition. ♪ Sick of leaving things half done... ♪ Do you really think some bauble will convince the heretics to side with you over an evil step-daddy who spoils them rotten with ponies and ice cream?<eos> - I don't have a choice.<eos> - Yes, you do.
You are such a strong girl.<eos> I am so sorry I didn't see it sooner.<eos> My son...<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> Kill me!<eos> Come on.<eos> Do it, Lily.<eos> You're wrong about so many things.<eos> I never had the courage to tell you before...<eos> But I do now.
When she turned her back on me, I thought I'd never find that kind of love again.<eos> You proved me wrong.<eos> Thank you, Lily.<eos> Next.<eos> You knew me at my brightest and my darkest.<eos> No matter what my mood, you always saw the light in me.<eos> I'll miss you, Lily.<eos> Cream violets.<eos> You remembered.<eos> Of course I did.
Yeah, kind of.<eos> To tell you the truth, I don't really spend that much time here myself.<eos> - I've kind of had a couple things to deal with recently.<eos> Yeah, cool.<eos> Hey!<eos> If you need a place to stay or something...<eos> I have one.<eos> Okay, yeah, but it's... it's not your only option.<eos> I don't think you know what you're getting into living with Lori.<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
- Excuse me?<eos> - Writing the book.<eos> What are you hoping to accomplish?<eos> I'm just trying to take care of my kid.<eos> Oh. At the expense of someone you also claim is your kid?<eos> She is my kid.<eos> I think the courts established that.<eos> Lori, you have no authority to write a book about Carter,<eos> - or about any of us.<eos> - Actually, I do.
I'm gonna go get a refill.<eos> Crash.<eos> So, how's it going with the new brother?<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> He's a little... hot and cold.<eos> ♪♪ Well, maybe not with everyone.<eos> Look who's number two now. Ahh. - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I, uh... I thought you had plans.<eos> I did, with, uh, with Bird.
No.<eos> It is surely as you say.<eos> Sorry that I woke you up.<eos> -It does nothing.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> She will be back. you should see the.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We can be heard.<eos> -So do we.
You...<eos> I and some of the other was going to go and have a beer.<eos> Run a little bit last night with the gang.<eos> Should you not comply with?<eos> Yes, actually. Why not? -It is clear you should.<eos> Come now.<eos> I was drunk, dropped my mobile and fell asleep on a boat.<eos> Inget happened, so drop it.<eos> -But if something happened...<eos> Yes, but it did not!
Hello.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I taste adrenaline in your mouth.<eos> What... what's happened?<eos> Tell me.<eos> I did something.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> It's bad.<eos> - Did you get it handled?<eos> - I did.
Mostly I dealt with people under him.<eos> I know he's some sort of international consultant.<eos> It is true, I am not the first consultant in the family, but the title is where the similarities end.<eos> Father's business exists to grease the skids so that politicians and corporations can operate around the globe.<eos> Sometimes these are noble ventures.<eos> More often, they are not.<eos> But they happen because Father is an influence peddler par excellence.<eos> And if he says he can restore us, he means it.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I did not.
There's magic there that can help us.<eos> There's magic in there that can help us.<eos> We can use it to find my brothers.<eos> You sure that the witch isn't home?<eos> No.<eos> And what does it matter?<eos> We're only gonna nip inside long enough to use her cauldron.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you know where that is?<eos> I do.
Rumple, run!<eos> No, Belle!<eos> I'm not running this time.<eos> No!<eos> Go!<eos> No, no.<eos> Do your worst.<eos> How...<eos> H-how did you know that would transform her back?<eos> I didn't.
I don't want him in there.<eos> It's not your choice.<eos> I'm going.<eos> - Just be careful.<eos> - Always.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> You gambled.<eos> If it had worked, you'd be a hero.<eos> Yeah, but it didn't.
Here.<eos> Pretend you're selling to me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For the pardon.<eos> Don't thank me.<eos> Thank your husband.<eos> Oh, you can't.<eos> He's dead.<eos> For what it is worth, I regret the incident in your office.<eos> Not yet, you don't.
Molk's just got his head up his ass.<eos> You think she's playing him, huh?<eos> She's been playing him up until now.<eos> - Why would she change? - Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I, uh, was getting the last of my stuff.<eos> You know, um, I'm gonna get my shit together... clean myself up, rehab.<eos> I owe it to the girls.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Marcus...<eos> This is Danny, Alex's partner.<eos> And Scottie.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Cheers.<eos> You didn't know, did you?<eos> How smart he was?<eos> I knew.<eos> But not really.<eos> Not in the way you did, no.
Daniel!<eos> I was in a state.<eos> I didn't deserve to be his mum.<eos> Surely you can't be so conventional as to think there's only one way to bring up a child?<eos> We are both his mother.<eos> Neither one less nor more real than the other.<eos> I took care of his mind and she took care of his other needs.<eos> He didn't know?<eos> No.<eos> Except he did.
He's accused of a capital crime, okay, and unlike the U.K.,<eos> America has the death penalty.<eos> Do you want to send an innocent man to his death?<eos> Look, I have no problem telling the FBI to bugger off.<eos> But this plan of yours will only work if you can actually deliver your friend.<eos> Yes, that's him.<eos> Yeah, I saw his picture on the news; that's why I called.<eos> He told us that his name was Leo Parks.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> I don't.
The Czech police and the FBI are calling you... or should I say Dmitry...<eos> a person of interest.<eos> This whole thing could get very uncomfortable for Six.<eos> Look, I roughed him up a bit, I didn't kill him.<eos> Even deep in legend, there are limits.<eos> You know these Chechens are ruthless, Terrence.<eos> I'm trying to earn their trust for Christ's sake.<eos> You're supposed to infiltrate them, not become one of them.<eos> Do we want the General or not?<eos> Well, damn right we do.
Why?<eos> You must become close.<eos> Close?<eos> At the mosque, at market... chitchat.<eos> Become good friends.<eos> Why?<eos> I will tell you when it is important for you to know.<eos> I do what you ask; now you ask more.<eos> How do I know this is last time?<eos> You don't.
- Well, we fight for Eoferwic because we do not wish to see England, piece by piece, become Daneland.<eos> I heard it said that we were pagans once.<eos> That wooden and Odin are the same.<eos> We saw the error of our ways, and we look to Rome.<eos> I heard the pagans had fierce gods of war.<eos> Well, we are right and they are mistaken.<eos> Osbert, we are blessed.<eos> I should make you swear on St. Cuthbert's comb never to mention the likes of wooden again.<eos> But what if I had a hound called wooden?<eos> - What if I did?
First blood or to the death?<eos> Uhtred!<eos> I'll be splitting your skull, boy.<eos> So one follows the other.<eos> Uhtred?<eos> Father Beocca.<eos> My goodness.<eos> You know this assling, Father?<eos> I do.<eos> Yes, I do.
Before the two walls meet, the first three rows of men act together to create a tall shield wall.<eos> First row crouches lower, protecting the lower body and legs.<eos> The second row reaches forward, protecting the upper body.<eos> The third row leans in, protecting the head.<eos> Four rows of men.<eos> Shields up.<eos> Shields together!<eos> Shield wall!<eos> I like it, arseling.<eos> I do.
UHTRED: Is Peredur a king, or not?<eos> I will call for Queen Iseult.<eos> My Lord, perhaps instead, you should take a moment and pray for guidance...<eos> Iseult!<eos> You are needed!<eos> (DOOR OPENING)<eos> I am blessed with two wives, two queens.<eos> Iseult is a Shadow Queen.<eos> You know what I require of you?<eos> Of course, you do.
Car accident.<eos> Bad one.<eos> Minivan rolled down an embankment.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Whole family.<eos> Man: Plenty of O-neg.<eos> You get any sleep today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I know when you're lying.<eos> - No, you don't.
He had a long wait... 10 hours... which didn't help.<eos> To me, it sounds like a muscle spasm, or, at worst, a compression fracture of the spine.<eos> Which is probably common in his line of work.<eos> I think a CT of his back would be the right precaution.<eos> Sounds right.<eos> Get him scanned.<eos> Let me know what comes back.<eos> Dude, you could've told her your theory.<eos> - I don't have a theory.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> It's bad luck.<eos> For who?<eos> For us, or for Dmitri's sister?<eos> Both.<eos> So I assume you'll want to focus on Ivan Kolashkov again?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I still have reservations.<eos> Of course you do.
and this matchbook we found on you how'd you come by that?<eos> you don't need to answer that.<eos> look, I'm a pack-a-day smoker.<eos> matches are just a means to an end.<eos> Yeah, not when they have the phone number of a girl who's been stalked by the killer.<eos> detective, people borrow cigarettes and bum matchbooks all the time.<eos> it doesn't incriminate my client.<eos> now that I think of it I got 'em from kent.<eos> you think he's been trying to set all this up on me?<eos> yes. we do.
And suddenly so grown up.<eos> So far, she doesn't hate me, thank god, but I have a feeling that's coming.<eos> No, no.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> I was a horrible teenager.<eos> Always causing trouble.<eos> Oh, and I was such a goody-goody.<eos> I was boring, really.<eos> Do you have kids?<eos> I do, yeah.
Doc, this isn't you.<eos> You have to fight back.<eos> I've been trying.<eos> Unfortunately for all of us, I was engineered for slavery.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's humiliating.<eos> Oh, meh, I do wish I could spare you the terrible pain of embarrassment.<eos> I'm sorry, Datak.<eos> You don't deserve this.<eos> None of you do.
I'll have a drink.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> I can't take this anymore, Hanson.<eos> The preaching, the praying, the curfews, the rules... We're 19 years old.<eos> We should be in college.<eos> We should be going to parties.<eos> We should be getting laid.<eos> We should be leaving.<eos> I need this, Hanson.<eos> No, you don't.
If we can figure out where he first saw her, we may still save her.<eos> I don't think I can do it.<eos> You did it before.<eos> I know, but I--<eos> You saw how she was flirting with me, touching my arm, begging me to come for a drink.<eos> Well, maybe she was just being nice.<eos> No, she's a slut.<eos> She wants me in her bed.<eos> I thought you loved me, Dana.<eos> Of course I do.
I don't want to go back home.<eos> - I don't want to go home...<eos> - What do you do, then?<eos> I'm just having a wonderful, wonderful time here.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> With friends and people that identify with me and I identify with them, and the stories we've had.<eos> And no matter h... how many people say they understand and support...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - they don't truly
Could be the key.<eos> That is, assuming we can get Santiani on board.<eos> I don't buy it. How would this girl get a doctor to go along with faking cancer?<eos> She had no history with an oncologist, no doctor record, no hospital record, no bills.<eos> She didn't need any of those things.<eos> What kind of person asks a cancer patient for proof?<eos> But why would anyone fake something like this?<eos> It's funny you should ask.<eos> Laura has a theory.<eos> Of course she does.
The boys don't even know that he's here.<eos> It's okay if they did.<eos> And I take it that it's okay with you.<eos> We already covered this.<eos> I know.<eos> I just thought that maybe because you saw us together that it might make you feel differently.<eos> It doesn't really matter what I feel.<eos> Laura, is there something you're trying to tell me?<eos> Or that you want me to say?<eos> You already did.
Once, twice...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who'll give me $700?<eos> Once, twice...<eos> Going once, going twice...<eos> Sold!<eos> What a bargain!<eos> Next up, item number 200!<eos> - You didn't wait for me.<eos> - I did!
Cut your losses and move on.<eos> But I say that about everything.<eos> If something's failed, light it on fire and watch it burn...<eos> In your rear-view mirror as you drive your way to successtown.<eos> Ah! Maybe you're right.<eos> But I'm also not ready to give up on this place.<eos> It was the future I wanted to build.<eos> I don't think mother nature felt the same way.<eos> I really cared about it.<eos> I still do...
- Thanks.<eos> I'm sorry for just bailing like that.<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> We're good.<eos> Who wants... water?<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Look, we've been through a lot together, and you know I'll always be your donor, but I need you to understand I have to publish this manuscript.<eos> But you're compromising us at the same time!<eos> I get that you're upset, but you can't just...<eos> You don't!
This wasn't the machinations of Shiva.<eos> This was Paul Briggs.<eos> You know, you were a better person when you believed in something.<eos> There's a bus station a mile north.<eos> Takes you direct to LAX.<eos> You're free.<eos> Mike?<eos> Don't thank me yet.<eos> You haven't heard my demands.<eos> How you doing, guy? Huh? You with me?
Stay away.<eos> It's normal?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nothing's happening.<eos> - Revives her. - It's too soon.<eos> How do you know that she will move to the mouse?<eos> She will have to.<eos> She will not lose contact with our world.<eos> Come on, come on, come on...<eos> She didn't more to the mouse!
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a vote to prepare for.<eos> Wait, what if I flip my vote?<eos> Flip whatever the hell you want, Louis.<eos> But you started this ball rolling, and now we all have to live with the consequences.<eos> I thought you were trying to avoid me.<eos> I was.<eos> But then I figured out you knew it was me anyway.<eos> How?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> No, it doesn't.
You should have come to us.<eos> And risk losing someone else?<eos> I thought the best way to control the darkness was to isolate myself.<eos> But when I did that, there was no one around to give me hope or tell me when I was being stupid!<eos> Fine.<eos> You're being stupid.<eos> So stop it.<eos> Right now, we have to clean up this mess.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
We were so close, Mary Margaret.<eos> Emma was seconds away from destroying the darkness and ending this.<eos> And Hook would have been dead.<eos> She chose love, David.<eos> And we would have done the same thing.<eos> We'd share one heart because we took the same kind of risk that Emma took.<eos> We save each other.<eos> That is what our family does.<eos> So have some faith in her.<eos> I do.
Might I suggest a dark curse?<eos> And crush the heart of the one I love most to enact it?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I won't kill Emma.<eos> Yeah, but there's always a loophole.<eos> Killian!<eos> It worked!<eos> - You're alive!<eos> - Aye.<eos> It did.
Look at me.<eos> That future you told me not to be afraid of...<eos> We can have it.<eos> The house in Storybrooke.<eos> I'm not afraid anymore.<eos> I want it.<eos> With you.<eos> It's ours.<eos> You just have to want it, too.<eos> Aye, love, I do.
Nobody ran away.<eos> I was shooting at them with my slingshot.<eos> I hit a few of them.<eos> It was a dramatic and difficult night.<eos> People didn't talk.<eos> They just were looking into each other's eyes, into each other's soul.<eos> I have never seen such courage.<eos> I was watching people and wondering, "When will they run?"<eos> And I'd understand, if they did.<eos> But they didn't.
It's just, it's overwhelming to me, so it's been a fun journey for me.<eos> I've learned so much in the last, you know, month, six weeks.<eos> KATE: Have you been dealing well with the freak factor?<eos> 'Cause...<eos> We are freaks in... to a lot of the world. CAITLYN: Um...<eos> I really feel like what we're really trying to do here is kind of normalize this as much as we possibly can.<eos> KATE: Well, part of the reason you want to is 'cause you don't want to be a freak. CAITLYN:<eos> I really feel like what we're really trying to do here is kind of normalize this as much as we possibly can.<eos> KATE: Well, part of the reason you want to is 'cause you don't want to be a freak.<eos> And who does?
Check The Scoop.<eos> _<eos> Audrey.<eos> Can I speak to you for a minute, please? Ooh! I am so sorry, Kevin.<eos> I have no idea how people found out.<eos> Look, can I just have the letter back please?<eos> I don't want to run the risk of it falling into the wrong hands.<eos> I don't even have the letter anymore.<eos> I threw it out.<eos> - Oh. You did? - Mm-Hmm.
I'm a really good friend.<eos> Do you day drink?<eos> Well, it's the day and I am drunk, so you tell me.<eos> I mean, Julia's our boss.<eos> I can't believe she wants Ricky to do her in her office.<eos> But that's what she said.<eos> She said, "I want Ricky to do me in my office."<eos> Lots of times.<eos> Didn't she also say, "Lots of times?"<eos> Yes, she did.
I got so caught up with my gold star review and trying to fix Ricky.<eos> I totally neglected you, man.<eos> What do you say we get out of this line and let Roxie do something on her own for once, huh?<eos> We can hit up Panini Castle on the way.<eos> Yeah!<eos> - I'm not even going to bring her the watch.<eos> I'm not going to bring her birth control either.<eos> Let's maybe just bring her that one last thing.<eos> - She doesn't need it.<eos> - No, she does, though.

You're right.<eos> - Psh. - I don't need a bathroom.<eos> I don't need any room.<eos> We work together.<eos> There will be plenty of opportunities to connect with Audrey.<eos> See, now that's... That's the Kevin I know.<eos> Never giving up hope, never showing signs of progress. Whoo-whoop!<eos> Eight... nine... 56... 57...<eos> We have a problem.<eos> - We do?
- Huh?<eos> - Call me when it's done!<eos> - No, no, I wasn't talking ab...<eos> Damn!<eos> Hey, so did you hear they... They want us to partner up for the... For the meeting tomorrow?<eos> - Yeah, I heard that.<eos> - Cool.<eos> So, are you and me doin' our thing?<eos> Oh, sorry, Ricky already asked me, so...<eos> Oh, he did? Oh.
He will never leave his post.<eos> But nature takes its' course.<eos> If something happens with Heitor, you are his successor and we know that.<eos> The committee, the shareholders, his son,<eos> - they all trust you...<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I have an unpayable debt with Heitor.<eos> I can not even think about his death.<eos> Who was talking about death?<eos> You did.
The shareholders committee will meet soon and decide who will take the position.<eos> Cesar knows.<eos> I am sure.<eos> You did not sleep last night, not thinking straight.<eos> And if he tells the police about the knitter?<eos> Worse, if he mentions the dinner.<eos> He does not need to do this.<eos> Clara, I do not fear anyone.<eos> But Cesar intimidates me.<eos> He always did.
There is nothing in that bag.<eos> Gun!<eos> No!<eos> _<eos> No!<eos> What did you do?<eos> She had a gun.<eos> What did you do?<eos> - She had a gun.<eos> - No she didn't!
We need to leave now.<eos> They were gonna kill us.<eos> Nolan, we need to leave.<eos> Don't! No!<eos> After them!<eos> Get 'em!<eos> It's time you and I put aside our differences.<eos> Nolan will be caught.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
- For that warrant, still?<eos> - Yeah, that too.<eos> But also that Russian guy that you rolled last night.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The one whose flute you pawned.<eos> After you drugged him, he came to, and he raped a woman in his hotel.<eos> I didn't drug him, and he gave me that flute.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Just stop it.<eos> - He did.
I'm not interested in pressing charges.<eos> I just need it back.<eos> I have a concert tomorrow in Montreal.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You're not making that.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're gonna be charged with the rape of Alessandra Bay.<eos> What? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪<eos> DNA says you did.<eos> So does she.
- Thank God what?<eos> - No, thank God that you're confused too.<eos> I just started these new meds today, and I thought maybe...<eos> - Stay focused.<eos> - You've just been given an examination of your magical aptitude.<eos> - "Magical"?<eos> - We had reason to believe you possess certain... nascent abilities.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I mean, I used to think that...<eos> - And perhaps you did at one time.
You're fired.<eos> 50 years it's been sitting there.<eos> It's unstable, it's poisonous.<eos> But what if we could extract the monocane we need from this, make a fresh potion?<eos> Shut this place down.<eos> Walk away.<eos> - And then what?<eos> What do you think would happen to me?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
But if he finds his grandmother...<eos> Ah, well, that would make things difficult.<eos> We... need to find her before he does.<eos> And kill her?<eos> Well, that's usually the best way, I think.<eos> Always.<eos> We need to deal with Jekyll before he knows the whole truth.<eos> And as soon as we've done what we need to with him, I will give you carte blanche... to kill as many of his friends as you wish.<eos> You know the way to a woman's heart.<eos> Yes, I do.
You've got to play catch-up.<eos> What is this?<eos> Maybe you should open it.<eos> "I must save the paper..."<eos> I'm opening it, I'm opening it!<eos> I knew you've been wanting one.<eos> Quentin, this... this is so nice!<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
That's right.<eos> Anyone have any suggestions?<eos> Okay, I'm gonna call it.<eos> Time of death -- 7:01 a.m.<eos> Back to work, everyone.<eos> It's beating.<eos> When did it start beating again? I don't know.<eos> The hard reason to do this -- the "No Heart Rhythm" part --<eos> We don't have it anymore.<eos> No, we don't.
Come on in, come on in.<eos> Okay.<eos> My God, you are, like, so pretty.<eos> Come here.<eos> Sorry, that's dinner.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sawyer, dinner time!<eos> Smells good.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.

Everyone who works here just took a sexual harassment seminar... it's a liability thing... and then they signed a form acknowledging that they went.<eos> These are the signed forms, those are our employee files.<eos> Your job is to put each form into the proper file.<eos> We have 22,000 employees.<eos> We figure it'll take you two weeks.<eos> Jessamyn Eubanks.<eos> I didn't break up with Teddy;<eos> I just didn't take the ring.<eos> Doesn't mean we broke up.<eos> No, it doesn't...
He came to see me one night last year, and... something was off.<eos> He said he'd been blind his whole life, but now, tonight, he could see.<eos> When he left, he said the next time I saw him, he'd be a different person.<eos> A better person.<eos> Three weeks later, his body floated up in the East River.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know what I remember about that night?<eos> His eyes.<eos> They had this shine.<eos> Just like yours did on that subway platform.
That sounded like the opposite of fly fishing.<eos> Can we talk about it later?<eos> I'm sorry about Ivan.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Did he have something to do with your job?<eos> The one we don't talk about?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't mean to push.<eos> When you were an operative, how did you know when you were in too deep?<eos> I didn't.
Welcome home, ladies.<eos> Do they still have that tampon making workshop?<eos> Ah, yes, they do.
What about you?<eos> So, you had a conversation with the dead guy.<eos> Oh, no, he wasn't quite dead.<eos> His soul hadn't crossed the threshold.<eos> I see.<eos> Did he tell you why he did it?<eos> Why money, of course.<eos> You humans, you love your money, don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Really?<eos> What's that?<eos> Won't say unless you take me with you on this.<eos> Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> I got you Too Vile, didn't I?<eos> Why do you care about this so much?<eos> About Delilah?<eos> Look, I just...<eos> I just do.
I am sure an agreement can be reached.<eos> Neither of us need lose any men.<eos> Neither of us need be weakened.<eos> Eat and drink at my hall.<eos> I assure you this is no trap.<eos> I will arrive at your hall after the new moon.<eos> I shall expect you.<eos> Then we have peace...<eos> - at least for a time?<eos> - Oh, we do.
- Your horses... belong to whom?<eos> - The Lord Odda.<eos> You will let us pass.<eos> - You selling or buying?<eos> - Selling.<eos> To the Danes.<eos> There is a peace.<eos> Did you not know?<eos> - Odda has made a peace?<eos> - No, I did not.
There can be no negotiation, Lord.<eos> Only surrender.<eos> - That is your advice?<eos> - It is.<eos> - I hear you.<eos> - Lord.<eos> Peace was secured with hostages, including my friend Brida and my brother, young Ragnar.<eos> Peace was further secured by Earl Guthrum's baptism and acceptance of the Christian God.<eos> Do you renounce the devil and all his work?<eos> I do.
Moving the fridge, opening the small door, latching the front door throwing keys, moving the fridge again...<eos> All in a flash!<eos> Are they Spiderman and Superwoman? What are they?<eos> And after all that planning, the blood-stained whiskey bottle on the table they didn't clear that up?<eos> How come?<eos> Because they weren't professional killers.<eos> Sir, it's simple if a father sees his daughter's dead body will he cry standing outside the room or run to hug her?<eos> Has your daughter died?<eos> Do you know what it feels like to lose a child?<eos> And you do?
We live in a civilized country.<eos> This is the case for health care!<eos> Can't you see that in a minute he's going to croak?<eos> And we'll all be fucking accused of refusing help to a sick person.<eos> What will we tell them then?<eos> That he saw a skeleton?<eos> What skeleton?<eos> "I don't know what skeleton.<eos> I didn't see it.<eos> But the patient did.
Thou has begun my transition.<eos> Thou has begun my transition.<eos> Don't be a baby.<eos> You left me there to die.<eos> Now we can all be together.<eos> Hey!<eos> -Black.<eos> -Black, pink, black.<eos> I like pink, go with pink.<eos> -Of course you do.
It's a little squishy valve at the back of the throat.<eos> Feel for the breath.<eos> You want me to stick my fingers in her throat?<eos> Yes.<eos> You have to, it's the intubation and have it ready.<eos> You need to hurry, you have to do it now.<eos> All right, locating it.<eos> Okay.<eos> You must go farther Lucas, all the way to the back of the tongue.<eos> -Now do it.
-No.<eos> -Absolutely not.<eos> You were never here.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm hanging up now.<eos> That's good, Lucas.<eos> Good night.<eos> I'll take a beer and a shot of whiskey.<eos> You forgot to shut the door.<eos> No, I didn't.
I can't believe we finally went out.<eos> I mean, work is gonna be so weird now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You want to come up?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Is this a cool 70th birthday party or what?<eos> I actually thought of it after going to my dear friend Chuck's funeral, and I thought, "Wouldn't he be tickled to hear everybody's kind words".<eos> So I said to Joanie,<eos> "I don't want to miss that.<eos> Let's just do this while I'm still here to enjoy it." And, besides, this is a... a terrific opportunity to bring my busy family together with everyone's lives moving so fast.<eos> My grandson, Tyler, he's applying for college.<eos> His sister, Samantha, she just had her first period.<eos> And my son, Greg, had our fourth grandchild with, uh... his wife.<eos> - Your dad just forgot my name again.<eos> - No, he didn't.
Nothing?<eos> Now open them. Good girl.<eos> What a good girl! Thank you. Wow.<eos> Lolie!<eos> When Lolabelle went blind,<eos> Elisabeth decided it was time for her to learn piano. So we set up some keyboards on the floor, and she would run over and turn them on and start to play.<eos> Lolabelle played every day for two years, and she got reasonably good.<eos> She was trained with a little clicker that Elisabeth used.<eos> She also played more experimental music, and she used some of the same programs and samples that I use.<eos> She also did a lot of benefit concerts for other animals and for various animal rights organizations.
Jane, what are you doing? !<eos> _<eos> No, no, Janie!<eos> Ugh, this is the last thing I need today.<eos> If your Abuela sees...<eos> It's okay, sweetie.<eos> We just need to clean this up.<eos> But alas, the day had left its mark.<eos> - _<eos> - The important ones do.
Yeah, Kyle loved your brother so much.<eos> I don't think your brother ever really forgave himself for getting Kyle into that lifestyle.<eos> Oh, did-did Kyle tell you that?<eos> No, your brother did when he became Kyle's sponsor.<eos> Excuse me, Mya, um, we do have to start prepping.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will you come see us after?<eos> I will if I can, yeah.<eos> I loved him, Alex.<eos> We all did.
You were trying to do your job.<eos> Well, my job is to look for signs, and I literally missed every single one.<eos> How bad is it, doctor?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Show me.<eos> I really don't think that's a good...<eos> With all due respect, this is my face and I need to see it.<eos> Show me.<eos> - I knew that... - I knew it was gonna be bad.<eos> I just didn't...
What Jackson means to say is...<eos> Has anyone been down to talk to you yet?<eos> Okay, just excuse us for a minute, okay?<eos> Bodies are stacking up out there.<eos> Yeah, I know, which is why you need to get your Freud on.<eos> Chop, chop.<eos> You need to, you know, shrink her, mobilize her legs.<eos> You want me to analyze her?<eos> Don't you think that's above my pay grade?<eos> Maybe, but I don't do feelings, especially other people's.
Pardon! Forgive, Sonja.<eos> Pardon.<eos> There is only one way To resolve this.<eos> Niklas must return the cocaine.<eos> Wade?<eos> Cocaine Niklas stole the Broman.<eos> Without him, it never happened.<eos> It was Niklas who took it?<eos> Have Stein said that?<eos> What the hell did you, then?
Michael, I think you came to see me because when people are in crisis they're searching for something more, usually something they've lost.<eos> I lost my parents, and I'm not getting them back.<eos> No, Michael, you lost your faith.<eos> Grammy.<eos> The day after you left school she gave me the money back.<eos> Her only request was that we use some of it to buy this bookcase to keep these books together.<eos> They're my father's books.<eos> And your mother's.<eos> I never knew why she did it.<eos> And now I do.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> Since when?<eos> Apparently, when you applied to work here, you listed CPR certified on your resume under special skills.<eos> We await your orders.<eos> Kind of ironic since under special skills I put "extensive knowledge of plate tectonics."<eos> But, whatever.<eos> Roxie, what are you doing here?<eos> Did you know that there was an earthquake last night?<eos> Yes, I did.
I used to just pretend that I lived alone, and when they would ask, I would say that you were a drifter I let in for a glass of water.<eos> But now...<eos> You know, the truth is I think I just need a change.<eos> This thing with Audrey's never gonna happen.<eos> The other day, I basically told her that she had feelings for me, and that we were destined to be together, and...<eos> Anyway, it doesn't matter.<eos> She doesn't even know that I'm here and not there.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Yeah, she knows.<eos> Everyone does.
No, no, no. How's Kevin?<eos> There's no visible signs of trauma?<eos> She's fine!<eos> Don't you guys get it?<eos> These are just stickers!<eos> I came to see Kevin. Is he okay?<eos> Why was he in the gym?<eos> Did he have to get stitches?<eos> You're asking questions like you care.<eos> While, Kevin, on the other hand, does not.
For what it's worth, it's only brutal for the first year.<eos> Okay, can I ask?<eos> How can I be his ideal woman, and five minutes after we break up, he's dating some barista who can't even properly use the possessive apostrophe?<eos> Did you Facebook stalk?<eos> No.<eos> A little.<eos> Well, whoever she is, she's probably very simple and very needy, and that's exactly what he wants right now.<eos> You know you could do the same.<eos> That cyber security guy clearly has an eye for you.<eos> No, he doesn't. Does he?
I didn't kill Pearson and I didn't take the baby.<eos> I got a gallery opening tonight.<eos> Are we done?<eos> No.<eos> We're not done.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I'll start with the obvious.<eos> Do you know Morpheus' identity?<eos> No.<eos> Nobody does.
What's with the fake glasses?<eos> As an actual glasses wearer, this is offensive.<eos> It's like non-disabled people who park in handicapped spaces.<eos> I was in and out in three minutes, young lady, and it was your stye medication I was picking up.<eos> That's a lot of bracelets there, buddy.<eos> Just ignore them.<eos> They're being sheep.<eos> If I'd listened to what other people said, I'd never have rocked my '90s frosted tips.<eos> We've got pictures.<eos> No, we don't.
Just finish the thought.<eos> Unless Jay really gets shot in the foot.<eos> I can't believe I'm saying this, once again, in only seven years of marriage, but please put the gun down.<eos> Don't be a baby.<eos> It's a pellet gun.<eos> It's just going to be a little Nick on the side, and then we go to the game.<eos> They're gonna see that it's true.<eos> They're gonna feel horrible because they didn't believe us, and then we don't have to go to anything for a whole year.<eos> - Mm. - I have to say, it makes sense.<eos> No, it doesn't!
We don't know what we would do without Barry.<eos> So good to us, Barry.<eos> Barry, you could take that down into the kitchen.<eos> - Thank you, Barry.<eos> - All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's very awkward with Barry.<eos> Why is it awkward with Barry?<eos> You know, because... he wants to have sex with me.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Yeah, we remember Anthony.<eos> No, yeah, he used to deliver groceries before Barry.<eos> Well, it's interesting you say that, because the last he was seen was leaving the store to deliver you groceries two weeks ago.<eos> Any idea where he might be, what might have happened to him?<eos> How do we know what he does with his time?<eos> You know what, the thing about Anthony was, he was very sad.<eos> No... no, he wasn't.<eos> He was fine.<eos> I think the reason is, is because he... you know, he wanted to have sex with me.<eos> He most certainly did not.
Max!<eos> Over here at our white trash window.<eos> I need help with shower.<eos> All right, Chestnut we're heading for work, soon.<eos> You know the rules...<eos> No R-rated movies, no sugary snacks and I want you standing up and asleep by 11.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> I can't turn it on.<eos> Well, drop your towel and tell it has a big nozzle.<eos> Did you even do a rat check?
- Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm some use for once.<eos> Are we made to be of use?<eos> Who can say?<eos> When you find your place, your thing, you must feel better.<eos> Maybe.<eos> It's like how some people can make you feel good or bad...<eos> Do you know anyone like that?<eos> Of course I do.
They differ hugely.<eos> Paul?<eos> You're here?<eos> Me?<eos> I swim every Wednesday.<eos> That explains your muscles.<eos> You think so?<eos> They're pretty discreet.<eos> I didn't think they showed.<eos> They do.
That was a really crap evening.<eos> No. Why do you say that?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm sick of it.<eos> My life's a mess.<eos> There are moments like that, but they never last.<eos> You're wonderful, Constance.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> True, I don't.
A lady never tells.<eos> Oh, and... erm... speaking of exploits... ..yours have upset the people.<eos> Since when is a wolf concerned with the opinions of sheep?<eos> A wolf cannot feast on lamb alone if the flock has bolted.<eos> You suggested a push for power.<eos> I have always had an iron fist in a velvet glove.<eos> You took the gloves off and that was a grave mistake.<eos> You need to subjugate your subjects.<eos> And I, luckily for you, have a plan.<eos> - You always do.
I don't have a chance.<eos> I've seen the way Jasper Frost looks at you.<eos> There's only one man who ever looked at me that way.<eos> He wasn't rich or royal.<eos> He was only the help.<eos> But he was my love.<eos> And I messed it up.<eos> Royally.<eos> - So if you have feelings...<eos> - I don't.
All right.<eos> There was a guy...<eos> Really?<eos> There was a guy. You know, I... I thought we were gonna get married.<eos> He was this... preppy kid I had a crush on, and he liked me, too, but we were from opposite sides of the tracks.<eos> He bailed and I ended up going to senior prom with my best friend, Duckie.<eos> That's the plot from Pretty In Pink.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I deserved that.<eos> You did.
It's easy.<eos> Here.<eos> Watch.<eos> Night Owl 5, Night Owl 5, this is Eagle 12.<eos> Eagle 12, I got a copy.<eos> See?<eos> There it goes.<eos> You okay, bud?<eos> I really miss my dad. I don't think anyone gets how much.<eos> I do, kid. I do.
Milton Cicero.<eos> Works in sanitation.<eos> Word is he's totally mobbed up.<eos> If our vic was doing research for his book and he asked too many questions,<eos> Milton here might have gotten suspicious and taken Dave out.<eos> Okay.<eos> He did come to my house, but I didn't kill him...<eos> I swear.<eos> - So, how do you know him?<eos> - I don't.
Oh.<eos> Oh, hate to burst your bubble, though.<eos> He ended up not being P.J. Moffet after all.<eos> Guy was a con man.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Really?<eos> !<eos> No!<eos> And, by the way, Castle, no matter what you say here, it doesn't prove that your new bff, Billy, didn't off Dave.<eos> No, it doesn't, but his alibi does.
We're screwed.<eos> Catching him with that empty thumb drive was our whole conspiracy charge.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Did what work?<eos> Are you the one that turned the lights out?<eos> I-I told her to do that.<eos> Why in the hell would you do that?<eos> Well, I thought our "midnight run" stratagem needed a little twist.<eos> Trust me, guys... if this works, we're gonna have him on a whole lot more than just obstruction.<eos> What if it doesn't? Hi.
- No. It's not.<eos> It's Hank's.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Come in and we'll spar to make sure you're ready, okay?<eos> You two seem pretty chummy.<eos> We were wrong about Hank.<eos> He didn't have anything to do with my dad's death.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Just...<eos> I do.
Then I am sorry.<eos> Not as sorry as I am.<eos> No.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> I have to.<eos> I can't let you hurt anyone.<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> Your mother signed the death warrants of our entire race and she used you to do it.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - Yes, you do.

Do you think she's pretty?<eos> Well, I guess.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Carter, do you maybe have a little crush on Supergirl?<eos> You got good taste, kid.<eos> This is my friend Winn.<eos> You're Supergirl fan, huh?<eos> You know...<eos> I know her.<eos> - No, you don't.

We may have a problem.<eos> Kara, do you have the live...<eos> Oh, uh, live, plus seven-day ratings for the Midwest satellite stations.<eos> - There.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Um, how you doing?<eos> - Handling.<eos> Digital called, sounds like you are, too.<eos> - That guy knows Superman, right?<eos> - Yes, he does.
No, she doesn't, she ended it.<eos> Because she felt you chose Superman over her.<eos> She was tired of coming in second.<eos> Look, I don't know anything about romantic love.<eos> I have not had the best luck with it.<eos> But if I ever really had it, I think I'd fight for it.<eos> I already put that behind me, Kara.<eos> I don't want to go back there.<eos> I don't want to do that again.<eos> Who does?
Previously, on Hawaii Five-O...<eos> What do you want from him!<eos> Gabriel wants me to transfer all my assets to a holding company he controls.<eos> Gabriel got away with the money that was meant to buy his freedom from the Yakuza.<eos> Without it, we're both dead.<eos> It's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
Drop the flower.<eos> Where is it coming from?<eos> Who cares? ♪ ♪ Oh, my God!<eos> (Hawaii Five-O theme song plays) ♪ Hawaii Five-O 6x04 ♪ Ka Papahana Holo Pono (Best Lai == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> I'll be real glad when Williams gets back on his feet again so I can drive my own damn truck.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure he'll appreciate the sentiment and the eggplant parm.<eos> Yeah, well, guy goes under the knife to save his kid, the least I can do is make sure he gets a decent meal.<eos> Speaking of which, you got any plans tonight?<eos> Weird segue.<eos> No, I don't.
Oh, I remember.<eos> You read it off your bottle of face wash.<eos> Yeah, that's right, princess.<eos> You gave career advice from soap.<eos> Okay, it was very good advice, and plus, Is it?<eos> how do you even know that?<eos> Have you been using my face soap, again? Hmm?<eos> Well, Monty has very sensitive skin.<eos> Yeah, he does.<eos> Oh, does he?
- You barely know me, Sam.<eos> - Well, I'm working on it.<eos> I wouldn't if I were you.<eos> Now go on. Get lost.<eos> Someone looks happy.<eos> Yep. I need a favour, though.<eos> Can I take half a day?<eos> Nate's taking me punting, don't you know?<eos> I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> I do.
Who cares?<eos> I don't care about her.<eos> She talks too much.<eos> Well, I don't know about that.<eos> But she does always eat the Lemon Zest bars, before I can get my mitts on them, mmm.<eos> You know Luna Bars are for women, right?<eos> Oh, I did not.<eos> Yeah, I think they have, like, menstrual blood in them.<eos> Stop that.<eos> No, they don't. Oof!
His phone records, bank accounts.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> You won't find anything.<eos> Oh, were you going to give one of these lectures?<eos> We all were.<eos> David, me...<eos> Adam.<eos> - You're a mathematician too?<eos> - No, I'm a chemist.<eos> We do the lectures every year.
Tenure at a nice, rich college in the States.<eos> Did like your brother, Mr Capstone?<eos> How can you even ask that?<eos> Yes, we rowed.<eos> Adam knew me better than anyone, and I him.<eos> But...<eos> My whole life, there hasn't been a day that he wasn't a part of.<eos> He was my brother, so never make the mistake, Inspector, of thinking that I didn't love him.<eos> How well did you know Paula Guitteau?<eos> I didn't.
I'd better get Djimon's arrest report written up.<eos> Calcium hydroxide's another name for lime.<eos> Sulphur and lime.<eos> Sulphur and lime.<eos> You think that's true?<eos> "Work alone is noble"?<eos> Bit outdated, isn't it?<eos> Being noble.<eos> I'm not sure I even know what it means any more.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Thank you.<eos> Actually, if you could drive my car back, I would... appreciate it.<eos> They won't release a car in the impound lot to someone with a suspended license, which... I don't even understand that.<eos> Oh, this just keeps getting better.<eos> That's your new friend, and you're just gonna kick him to the curb?<eos> Just like that?<eos> Yes.<eos> I am surrounded by robots.<eos> Now that we have some privacy...<eos> We don't.
"Electric down.<eos> "Trying to get the hatch open.<eos> We're compromised."<eos> "No generator."<eos> No oxygen system.<eos> The shared ventilation system provides all of us with roughly 150 cubic feet of oxygen.<eos> Divide that by 13, each consuming 1.5 cubic feet of oxygen per hour, we have one hour and ten minutes of oxygen left.<eos> I'm a Marine-- I spent a lot of time on a ship.<eos> You have immersion suits down here for underwater escape.<eos> Uh, we do, but not in this compartment.
And I know what it's like to be scared better than anybody else.<eos> But tonight you're gonna wake up in recovery, 100% fine, and I will be there to tell you so.<eos> Sylvester, I really do love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I'll see you tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry to hear your friend is sick.<eos> Seriously? We have to put a bell on you.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.
It turns out Open Vistas is no ordinary rehab.<eos> They specialize in Marks syndrome, a brain disorder common to former Precrime prisoners.<eos> Halo burn.<eos> So you're saying my victim was a nurse in a building full of killers?<eos> I'm saying my victim, and future-killers, technically, the city set them free after Precrime was abolished.<eos> Oh, that doesn't make them innocent.<eos> These people would be murderers.<eos> Yeah, but the trick is, which one are we looking for?<eos> We have no DNA, no face to run.<eos> What if we did?
- of our civil liberties.<eos> - You done?<eos> - For now.<eos> - You...<eos> You want me to go back... inside Metro?<eos> - I haven't been there since...<eos> - Since you were hooked up<eos> - in a milk bath, I know.<eos> - No.<eos> Actually, you don't.
I don't know if it really helped.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Might need a follow-up.<eos> What about you?<eos> After your father was killed?<eos> - Or is that too hard to talk about?<eos> - Okay, please don't turn this into every relationship I've been in for the last ten years.<eos> Yes, it was a traumatic event and, yes, there's some stuff I need to deal with.<eos> And I will when I have time.<eos> But right now I don't.
I'm into costumes that look like stuffed animals.<eos> Like sexually.<eos> It's a fetish, okay?<eos> I was not expecting that.<eos> Here's what I'm going to need.<eos> I'm going to need details, photos.<eos> We don't need details or photos.<eos> Unless you have them, and they're hilarious.<eos> We definitely don't need details or photos.<eos> Yes, we do.
Did you do those things together?<eos> Well, he was so busy.<eos> We barely had time to see each other.<eos> But you did see each other.<eos> Of course.<eos> Just two nights ago, we had a late dinner together at the Congee Noodle House.<eos> He likes the number 8 with duck sauce.<eos> Abby, are you absolutely sure this was two nights ago?<eos> The building security insists that Zac never left his apartment.<eos> Well, he did.
You really shouldn't have, but I'm so glad you did.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God, I loved to cook for him.<eos> And I'm sure he loved it right back.<eos> Meal from Mom, it's comfort food.<eos> If I had the chance, I would tell him that being independent doesn't have to mean being alone.<eos> He always said he was fine.<eos> I just wish...<eos> I wish I had made him open up to me more, you know.<eos> I do.
Nobody's life is important right now.<eos> Nothing's important but getting on that ship and destroying it.<eos> I'm sorry, Nolan, but that's true.<eos> You have to leave.<eos> It's just not a party without you.<eos> Wish me luck?<eos> Oh, you don't need luck.<eos> You'll be back.<eos> You always come back.<eos> And when you do...
You... What?<eos> That's what fashion people call cleaning out your closet.<eos> The rule is if you haven't worn it in a year, it has to go.<eos> It's midnight.<eos> Did you know that if you have big shoulders you can't wear boxy jackets?<eos> And if you have orange in your skin, you have to stay away from anything in the pink family.<eos> Okay.<eos> You don't have boxy shoulders or orange skin, so.<eos> Did you know that our daughter knows all this stuff?<eos> I didn't.
Target 1 in sight, ahead of us.<eos> I've lost him, he's out of sight.<eos> Target 2 in sight on side 3, in the garden.<eos> It's nice, here.<eos> Please!<eos> Police!<eos> Yes, Le Coz? Where are you?<eos> We've not heard from you.<eos> I've not had time.<eos> I still don't.
The op? Yeah.<eos> I secured a ring.<eos> I reconned a location.<eos> Now I just got to execute.<eos> I mean, it just, it sounds so romantic the way you say it, you know?<eos> I mean, I could see it now-- you and Catherine in matching camouflage cargo pants on some very exotic shooting range, and you get down on one knee, and you say, "Babe, I want you to join my unit for a lifelong mission."<eos> I mean, it's every girl's fairy tale.<eos> Oh, yeah, you want to hear a secret?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do? Mm-hmm.
CSU said that nothing in the area has been excavated.<eos> Ever.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, then Exley and Jerry both got the location wrong.<eos> Yeah, but according to Exley's journal, the treasure's still on the island.<eos> Which means the killers are still here.<eos> Yo. Boss man. Want a slice?<eos> I got pineapple-pepperoni.<eos> A bit Luke, still tasty.<eos> No, I don't.
Marco Simoncelli has grabbed his first MotoGP podium.<eos> It's well deserved after everything he's been through this season.<eos> SIMONCELLI: It feels unbelievable.<eos> I'm really, really happy and I want to say thanks to everybody who never stopped believing in me when I was in a difficult moment.<eos> And everybody who helped me to arrive here today.<eos> NARRATOR: With three races to go, Lorenzo was the only rider with any hope of beating Stoner in the championship.<eos> There were 65 points between them.<eos> The odds were stacked against the Spaniard.<eos> But you never know, Stoner might make a mistake.<eos> He didn't.
I never mentioned a cross.<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> The Sisters of, uh, St. Agatha have been rumored to perform exorcisms of the iron cross.<eos> A pointless effort.<eos> No matter the good intention.<eos> After all that talk of armies and ships, you defeated the English with nothing more than a letter.<eos> I can't take much of the credit.<eos> It was Mary's plan.<eos> How did you know it would work?<eos> I didn't.
For six years, our police held them against their will and used them to save lives.<eos> But after the government's Precrime program was shut down, they were finally released.<eos> They kept themselves safe and hidden from the world, until now. - Up all night again? - No, I was just, um...<eos> Obsessing over your father's case files?<eos> It's just, there's nothing in any of these about the blind drug dealer Dina Winter talked about, Lycon.<eos> Because the files are just shells.<eos> Most of the data didn't get converted during the system upgrade 15 years ago.<eos> So until someone syncs the two, the old evidence might as well be stuck on Mars.<eos> - We know how to get to Mars.<eos> - We do.
Maybe our government, maybe another.<eos> We're always gonna be hunted.<eos> I'd prefer that wasn't the case.<eos> You?<eos> I'd keep it.<eos> Why?<eos> Seeing people get slaughtered and not make a dime?<eos> Yeah, that part's tough.<eos> But I have a chance to save them.<eos> Not many people do.
What do you know?<eos> Apparently someone doesn't want Vega to see her next birthday.<eos> I'm not in the mood for glib today.<eos> And I wasn't in the market for a fat lip.<eos> Why didn't you call me when you got Vega's name?<eos> Because of Agatha?<eos> Because she saw a milk bath in her vision?<eos> Because she found one.<eos> The feds had plans for us when Precrime ended.<eos> Maybe still do.
You've earned it.<eos> At this point, why even go to bed, you know?<eos> I feel like if I just keep moving, I'll be fine.<eos> Ooh, I have a good idea.<eos> Let's go grab burgers, huh?<eos> Double-double, animal style.<eos> My treat.<eos> Who's with me?<eos> You know they make animal-style fries, too?<eos> Of course I do.
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, it's gonna be beautiful when they uncover it.<eos> Because that will make your building a historical landmark, and they cannot tear it down.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> This is amazing.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> It was one of those moments when it felt like it was all right there.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I want this.<eos> Shauna, I do.
Against who?<eos> Wesen.<eos> Nobody knows how many there are or how big a group it is, but it's all over, not just in this country, it's everywhere, like a revolution.<eos> I had to help.<eos> Nick, HW needs Grimms on their side, and I'm not the only one fighting for them.<eos> I worked with one in Lisbon, and I heard about another in Bangkok.<eos> You went to Lisbon? Twice.<eos> I never know where I'm going or what I'm supposed to do until I have to do it, but... I mean, there are sections of HW all over the world.<eos> Do they pay you for this?<eos> Actually, yeah, they do.
Can we not talk about this, please?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't worry, they'll get Cruz, and then they'll get the rest of them.<eos> You don't know what these people are like.<eos> I've dealt with a few.<eos> They're crazy, what they're gonna do.<eos> They told you? No, no.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I thought you said they didn't talk to you.<eos> They didn't.
Look, we gotta do this, okay?<eos> It's our duty.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> I'm thirsty.<eos> Here's your breakfast, bud. Okay?<eos> And here's your anti-convulsant.<eos> Do you want me to crush it up and put it in your food?<eos> No, I can still chew.<eos> No, he doesn't need the meds yet, anyway.<eos> Yes, he does.
"Church for the Blind"?<eos> Write it out.<eos> Great.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> It is so humbling to be able to help someone like you.<eos> Say hi to Maggie.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> It's so embarrassing.<eos> - You called me in here for something?<eos> - I did not.
- Oh, that's Judge McCan.<eos> That's Judge McCan!<eos> Oh, I'm supposed to recognize judges now?<eos> - Hey!<eos> It's good - Oh, hi!<eos> - to see you guys!<eos> - How are you?<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Yeah, so I see you got some drinks.<eos> - Yeah, we did. We did.
After two hours of Bahni's mobile going to voicemail, I called the campus police.<eos> The phone is in the room, but she isn't.<eos> There's something else we need to talk about.<eos> Did she tell you she was withdrawing from school? She was?<eos> She got a B-plus on her midterm.<eos> She thought her world was over. Aasia, you never told me that.<eos> She picked up extra-credit work and she was going to withdraw her request on Monday.<eos> This, whatever's happening, it isn't related to that.<eos> I need you to believe me.<eos> I do.
Fine, I quit, too!<eos> Then get out of my house!<eos> With pleasure!<eos> (sighs) Raj, wait.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> LEONARD: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it's not.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> Amy's gone, and you two are married now, so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.<eos> Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> No, I do.
Lane didn't have anything to do with those, did he?<eos> - Dr. Bell, I know you and Lane had a<eos> - Don't.<eos> - And you're my boss, so...<eos> - That's not what this is about.<eos> So, then what is it about?<eos> Is he hurting you?<eos> Dr. Miller's looking for me, so...<eos> I should get to work.<eos> How we doing on the O neg situation?
She's like, I'm gonna go to this next land-run, and I'm gonna ride a horse in, like a badass bitch.<eos> Boom!<eos> Cannon goes off.<eos> And she does, she rides a horse in.<eos> She's super cool.<eos> And then the horse acts like a [bleep] asshole.<eos> Throws her. Tromps her face with its little horse hooves...<eos> - She what?<eos> - Tromped her face.<eos> What do they do?
Also grateful?<eos> Petra, because the fertility clinic discovered one last sample of Rafael's sperm.<eos> And thanks to some wise words from Rafael's sister Luisa...<eos> That should have been your baby!<eos> A few too many drinks and a willing turkey baster... well, you get the idea.<eos> But she didn't get off Scott-free.<eos> I just wanted to discuss the fact that you stole Mr. Solano's sperm.<eos> And let's not forget<eos> - Rogelio and Xiomara.<eos> - I totally do!

It's not every day I recommend his assistant become the manager of the lounge.<eos> Executive assistant.<eos> Oh. Well, that's a position I can get you...<eos> That's what I am!<eos> You have until the end of the day, or I'm gonna tell Rafael that you stole his sperm.<eos> Have him sign my new contract.<eos> Of course I didn't read the contract.<eos> Who reads contracts?<eos> That's what I have lawyers for.<eos> At least I did, anyway.
Then I found I didn't want to leave.<eos> It started to feel like home.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Pulse is rapid and irregular.<eos> Mum, mum, mum.<eos> Just try and breathe.<eos> Breathe slowly for me, okay?<eos> Breathe slowly.<eos> She needs an EKG, stat.<eos> No, she doesn't.
What did you call it?<eos> You really want to do this again?<eos> No, I-it's streptococcus pyogenes.<eos> We use that and e. Coli in the perfume-making process.<eos> So, you admit to working with the exact stuff that infected Gigi.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> Rosie, I think we're gonna nail Ian.<eos> He had access to the bacteria that's used in...<eos> - Perfume, yeah, I know.<eos> - Of course you do.
How was your first day?<eos> Same class, same books.<eos> Same class, same books?<eos> Didn't they promote you to class 10?<eos> Of course I was promoted to class 10.<eos> 9th or 10th, what difference does it make?<eos> Just the books get a little thicker.<eos> Yeah, but you must have new teachers?<eos> Yes.<eos> We did.
Where's Chanda?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why ask me?<eos> You know why.<eos> I know everything, but you don't.<eos> What?<eos> What do you know?<eos> That she's your mother.<eos> Then you must know where she's been going these days.<eos> Yes, I do.
I assume you had one of your psychic visions that told you Vaughn was sleeping with Taylor?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The kind I would like to erase.<eos> The man has sex with an ankh necklace on.<eos> On a leather cord.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Terrence's lawyer just pushed the interview, time TBD.<eos> And he's insisting we do it at his house.<eos> I hate rich people.<eos> I do.
You're going down, idiot.<eos> I know, I was all jacked up on adrenaline and I lost control.<eos> According to The Ledger, that's standard operating procedure for you and your crew.<eos> - That article was just mean and...<eos> - So you sent death-threats to Terrence Van Doren and then ran his car into the Hudson with Isabel Van Doren inside.<eos> I was in bed with my wife when that crash happened.<eos> - You can ask her.<eos> - We will.<eos> Maybe one of your biker buddies wanted some highway justice, huh?<eos> They all did, but not with violence.
...But you're ashamed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then... Mm-hmm.<eos> ...Drink poison.<eos> Yep. That is the only move that will satisfy a debbie.<eos> Pretty much.<eos> Hi.<eos> So, as everybody saw last night, fozzie bear --<eos> Lost touch with reality? Yeah, and speaking from personal experience, You never quite get it back.<eos> No, you do not.
Or have you decided you want to be part of your own relationship?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm not getting her anything.<eos> She said she didn't want a gift.<eos> - Oh, is that what she said?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hmm. Let me look that up in my lady translator.<eos> - What? - Boop-boop-boop-boop.<eos> Ah, look at that.. She wants a gift.<eos> - She does?
It's, um...<eos> Oh gee, this is awkward.<eos> Uh, I mean you're the last person...<eos> Quit sputtering and muttering and stammering and boring me.<eos> Just spit it out, frog.<eos> Can you give us a minute, Deadly?<eos> Kermit.<eos> You seem to be under the false impression that I want to be in this room.<eos> - Huh? - You don't know me.<eos> No one does.
Look!<eos> I don't even have to clean any of this stuff up.<eos> Some poor schlub from production will do it.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> That's me.<eos> It's okay. I'll just, um, call Mom and tell her I'll be home a little late.<eos> You know what?<eos> Tell your mom not to wait up.<eos> You have a hot date tonight.<eos> I do? Cool!
Correct, yes.<eos> Do you believe she's innocent?<eos> My job isn't to determine her guilt or innocence.<eos> You didn't answer my question.<eos> My job is to apprehend Ms. Keen, and I have no problem doing that.<eos> I am not asking about your job.<eos> I'm asking what you believe.<eos> Elizabeth Keen is not a terrorist.<eos> So you believe she's innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.
Salma, Penelope, J. Lo.<eos> Rogelio, be realistic.<eos> You're right... younger.<eos> Selena, Demi, Emma Stone.<eos> I heard she can play any race.<eos> - Stop, you know who it should be.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Her agent said she's willing to screen test.<eos> - I-I don't know what you mean.<eos> - You do.
So that's my advice to you.<eos> There's a baby coming.<eos> Whatever that means to you, embrace it.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Okay, Mateo's down.<eos> So... let's talk about Petra.<eos> I mean, if you still want to.<eos> No, yes, of course I do.
I'm Adam.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Look, I don't know what to say here.<eos> I...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He trusted you.<eos> - Hey, you Ben Forsick?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How do you know Roxy Richards?<eos> - I don't.
He was executed point-blank in his garage.<eos> Second, Mr. Josh Henderson.<eos> He's a UIC dropout turned computer hacker.<eos> He preyed on a string of elderly victims.<eos> Drained their bank accounts.<eos> Got probation, but he was ambushed at a stoplight less than six months ago.<eos> And the third, one Terrence Jenkins.<eos> Arrested for multiple sexual assaults of underage girls.<eos> None of them would testify at trial, so he walked.<eos> He did.
Just tell the truth and everything'll work out.<eos> You'll see.<eos> I love you, Daddy.<eos> They're ready for us now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We are on the record on October 13, 2015.<eos> This is the videotaped deposition of the defendant, Mr. Kevin Harper, being taken according to federal rules of civil procedure on behalf of the plaintiffs.<eos> Sir, will you raise your right hand?<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
There's something you should know... The police found Tatiana's body.<eos> Please, don't do this, I'm begging you!<eos> Where's my daughter? !<eos> William Taylor, step out of the vehicle with your hands where we can see them.<eos> I got him.<eos> That's the man with the skull tattoo. He's right there.<eos> That is not him, William.<eos> Damn it, why aren't you listening to me?<eos> That man has my daughter!<eos> - No, he doesn't.

I didn't tell you because of this.<eos> I knew how you'd react, and it wasn't worth it.<eos> Oh, oh. I'm not upset about him.<eos> I'm upset about the lie.<eos> You're also upset about him.<eos> Of course I'm upset about him!<eos> He's Korean Channing Tatum!<eos> Come on, I'm sure you have an ex who's more attractive than you let on.<eos> No!<eos> I didn't!
I guess it did.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> I love a story with a happy ending.<eos> I also love stories with robots.<eos> Hey, let me take a picture, like I did 20 years ago.<eos> You know what?<eos> I-I think I got a better pose for you.<eos> Allison...<eos> I always knew I loved you, (Voice breaking): But I had no idea how amazing it'd be to build a family and a life with you.<eos> But I do now.
All right.<eos> Fine.<eos> We're here to ask you a few questions about your relationships with Scott McCoy.<eos> Call our lawyers, honey.<eos> I will... right after I drag you down to the precinct.<eos> You can post a photo on Instagram.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If you really had anything on us, you wouldn't be down here trying to see us naked.<eos> Oh, we've got something.<eos> Or... rather, one of you does.
You're not even trying to hurt me.<eos> We are just making it look good.<eos> And that gronhak up there is gonna figure that out.<eos> We need to have a real fight.<eos> Unless maybe you've lost your edge?<eos> Afraid you can't handle me?<eos> I'm Thanos' daughter!<eos> I worked for Ronan.<eos> Tell me you never wondered if I had something to do with the destruction of your family!<eos> I didn't, but...
You came over to my place!<eos> Should I not have any expectations?<eos> -Expectations?<eos> -Expectations.<eos> On my part, at least.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do you really dislike me?<eos> I mean, never mind.<eos> Of course you do.
You've gone too far this time, lady.<eos> You come onto my turf, there are consequences.<eos> Well, this... this is my turf, Beef.<eos> Get out now and don't come back.<eos> You think I'm scared of you and your little girls?<eos> Oh, speaking of girls.<eos> I have this, er... friend and he's seeing one.<eos> But, er... he doesn't trust her.<eos> - She's got this mother.<eos> - They always do.
Wait.<eos> Just wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you think this is one of those things.<eos> "Cop shoots an unarmed man" kind of thing?<eos> Because my partner and I got bullet holes in us that tell a different story.<eos> Okay, settle down.<eos> I thought you and I had something<eos> - in the bank here, Leanne.<eos> - We do.

- What?<eos> - Get Neal, Jesse.<eos> Now, please.<eos> What's going on?<eos> His defibrillator just shocked him twice in 10 seconds.<eos> Heart rate's 160.<eos> It's malfunctioning.<eos> Make it stop before it happens again.<eos> Take it easy. Try and calm down.<eos> - Do something!
I'm sorry we're early, but it started to snow in Tahoe and you know there's nothing like fresh powder.<eos> Oh, you don't have to tell us that.<eos> Merry Christmas, Mom.<eos> Aw, thank you, honey.<eos> I got you a perfume that's a little less obvious.<eos> Oh, where does he get it?<eos> And these are for you and Christy.<eos> Oh, wow, how unexpected.<eos> Oh, please, don't feel bad if you didn't get anything for us.<eos> We don't.
Oh, my God!<eos> These are the most beautiful earrings I've ever seen.<eos> I picked them out.<eos> Happy housewarming/ Merry Christmas.<eos> You really shouldn't have done this.<eos> They look so expensive.<eos> They are.<eos> We just wanted to say we're sorry.<eos> We were way out of line to think we knew what was best for you.<eos> Even though we do.
What are you talking about?<eos> ♫ la la la la la la la la la♫ -That's not it.<eos> - Kim Hye Jin, you sure are good at stubbornly sticking to your opinion.<eos> I'm telling you that's not it.<eos> ♫ unfamiliar ♫ 1, 2, 3.<eos> S.E.S. (famous girl group in the 90's)<eos> S.E.S...<eos> Did you like dramas, too?<eos> -Yeah, I liked it.<eos> -What did you like?
See her safe and settled and get her off our caseload.<eos> Good words.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's so dreadful to have it confirmed by the post-mortem.<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> Suicide.<eos> DCI Howe called me.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Worries you?<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come round.<eos> Just come back to mine.<eos> My parents are gone all night.<eos> My mum would murder me.<eos> What, you...<eos> You don't want to?<eos> No, I do.
Come on!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come round.<eos> Just come back to mine.<eos> My parents are gone all night.<eos> My mum would murder me.<eos> What, you...<eos> You don't want to?<eos> No, I do.<eos> Of course I do.
I don't want you to ever touch me again.<eos> I'm sorry for making you feel bad.<eos> I figured it was a no-strings thing for you too.<eos> I don't do one-night stands.<eos> Two, three, maybe four, depending on what I still need to accomplish.<eos> You mean there was stuff we didn't do?<eos> A lot of stuff.<eos> Sex isn't casual to me.<eos> I want the woman that I'm with to feel amazing.<eos> And I did!
Mike Barnow?<eos> And his stupid dog.<eos> My assistant's allergic...<eos> it caused a hell of a...<eos> What did he want?<eos> Copies of my official schedule from last week, when we were meeting about the whole...<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Not here.<eos> I thought Russell Jackson had her under control.<eos> He does.
You don't have a soul, all right?<eos> Amara sucked it out.<eos> Wha--<eos> Dean.<eos> You want to be a little more blunt?<eos> H-how is that even possible?<eos> Look, this is just so you don't get in trouble, all right?<eos> We'll be right back, and then we'll figure out what to do with you.<eos> Well, how do -- how do I get it back -- my soul?<eos> Generally, you don't.
Seems insane to leave our one and only angel friend on the bench.<eos> I'll call him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ...Itliterally doesn't matter.<eos> Well,we're gonna get to all the results in just a second.<eos> We're gonna start with, uh...<eos> Let's go back to our first story.<eos> Uh, Louis, Silla, and Edwin.<eos> Hi.<eos> Cass. How you doing, buddy?
So... Been a crazy couple of days.<eos> Darn tootin'.<eos> But you've been great.<eos> I really appreciate all your hard work.<eos> And, uh... Sorry if I was a little tough on ya.<eos> You mean you treating me like a punching bag?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> I got baggage, too, Donna.<eos> Everyone does.
From you?<eos> No way.<eos> No. I mean, from here.<eos> All this.<eos> The hunting life.<eos> Do you?<eos> Hmm. Ever think... That maybe you wanna go to school?<eos> Make some friends?<eos> But I have you.<eos> Yeah, you do.
The chicken's come home to roost.<eos> This ghastly force set free when the Mark was removed.<eos> So you know.<eos> I've heard whispers.<eos> As bad as they say?<eos> Well, let's just say that everyone in this room might hold a piece of the puzzle to corking it back up.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> And what happens to me once the danger's past?<eos> How do I know I can trust any of you?<eos> You don't.

We got it from here.<eos> Hey. My name's Erin Lindsay.<eos> I'm with the Chicago Police Department.<eos> I'm gonna come in, okay?<eos> We're here to help.<eos> There's a lot of people that are looking for you.<eos> Sarah?<eos> You know my name?<eos> I know all about what happened to you.<eos> No, you don't.
Should we submit a court order for a hospital visit?<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Then it's an all-out war.<eos> What about stock price?<eos> It would make Miss Young Ae feel uncomfortable.<eos> Very much.<eos> - As you can see, she's still the same.<eos> You have to manage her well.<eos> If anything goes wrong... you know?<eos> Of course I do.
That money bug.<eos> I'll make him buy me some food somehow!<eos> Just wait and see!<eos> You're not a crazy girl.<eos> You're a beggar.<eos> Chief Nurse!<eos> Where is Patient Kim Young Shik?<eos> Excuse me, where is his guardian?<eos> - He doesn't have a guardian.<eos> - He doesn't?
We saw Forbidden Quest's death.<eos> Recall Kim Sung-yeol raised the dead to save him?<eos> The accused said he passed on the Journal. It may be with Kim Sung-yeol.<eos> We should focus on Kim Sung-yeol...<eos> You're ignorant!<eos> Kim Sung-yeol is helping the prince!<eos> A daughter despises her father and wishes to rise above him...<eos> Rather amusing.<eos> Do you still want to be queen?<eos> I do.
- Yeah.<eos> You know what they say, starts off quiet, ends with a riot.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> Ooh, got you a present.<eos> What?<eos> - In there.<eos> - Come on? !<eos> - I don't have to get you anything back, do I?<eos> - No, you don't.
Oh, yeah.<eos> [Come here.]<eos> Should get that looked at.<eos> Rumble in the jungle, eh?<eos> Heard you landed a pretty good punch yourself.<eos> Ah, well...<eos> What I've lost in speed, I've made up for in accuracy.<eos> Look, Jake, I understand your, erm...<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Thanks.<eos> (Yes!<eos> )<eos> 'And I'm telling you now that we have recovered<eos> 'DNA from the inside of this balaclava.'<eos> We will be running it against the fingerprints you provided today, and we'll have the test results back in a few days.<eos> Are we going to find your DNA on this item?<eos> No comment.<eos> DC Hawkins, I believe you have another exhibit for us...<eos> I do.
Yeah, actually yes, yes, I am - - I am sick.<eos> I'm sick of worrying about you every time you go to work.<eos> I'm sick of freaking out every time the phone rings cos it might be the station, or...<eos> - Or the hospital, saying something's happened to you...<eos> - Al,<eos> I'm fine!<eos> How can you say that after what happened to you today?<eos> You had someone pull a gun on you!<eos> You nearly died...<eos> - But I didn't.
I still don't know where I'm at.<eos> I mean, you know Voight little better than me.<eos> You think he thinks I'm good police?<eos> I think Voight thinks everyone's got room for improvement.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, I feel you.<eos> Is that James Whitaker?<eos> Oh, he's the captain of the 31st, right?<eos> Like the Black Pope of Chicago.<eos> Does a big card game.
He volunteered at a juvenile detention center last year as a conditioning coach.<eos> You throw a rock in there, you're gonna hit somebody willing to pull a trigger for that price.<eos> Find this guy.<eos> Ethan, um... I got to go, but your mom's on her way in.<eos> Okay?<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> Does my mom need to know?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> She does.
Three of those.<eos> That's him.<eos> Jessie Mandel, released three weeks ago.<eos> Okay, I need an address.<eos> 524 Green Street.<eos> It's a halfway house.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Got a Jessie Mandel living here?<eos> I did.
The Bandaris have assured me a thousand times Olivia Pope is not a problem.<eos> She slithered into the bed of a married man.<eos> She's unclean.<eos> She's a whore.<eos> You don't receive a whore.<eos> You married one.<eos> Very different situation.<eos> They won't receive her.<eos> It's never going to happen.<eos> It just did.
That way.<eos> No way. What if it's a trap?<eos> It's not a trap, it's a beacon.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Following your tattoos got us here and got us shot at.<eos> The tattoos led to Guerrero.<eos> Why send us out here just to kill us?<eos> How'd they know we'd be in this exact spot at this exact moment<eos> - to see the derricks?<eos> - They didn't.
Wait. Really?<eos> Hey, a good idea's a good idea.<eos> Besides, it wasn't the world's worst haunted house.<eos> The bald caps were good.<eos> The spaghetti...<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> You guys set me up.<eos> And we almost got away with it.<eos> Oh, wait!<eos> We did!
♪ You're the girl of my dreams, nope, my nightmares ♪<eos> ♪ You're like Jason, Mike Myers, Carrie and Freddy ♪<eos> ♪ But I don't want to run away, I want to go steady ♪<eos> Is that a different Allen from the last video?<eos> No.<eos> Yes... What?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> They switch Allens sometimes, Bobby.<eos> No, they don't.
Where are you?<eos> Just keeping an eye on our guy Bruno.<eos> Well, stop.<eos> I talked to Nate, and he promised he was gonna look into him.<eos> And you think your cop buddy's - gonna handle this the right way? - Yes.<eos> And what does the "right way" mean?<eos> - I'll call you later.<eos> - They're dating?<eos> Michaela's pretty much the only other number he calls, but I don't think she knows who he is.<eos> But Wes does?
You're not gonna get me drunk and convince me to sign this deal.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't know who killed Sam Keating.<eos> Not for sure, at least.<eos> That was a stall tactic, a very smart one.<eos> I understand why you did it.<eos> This can't be an easy decision for you to make.<eos> Then don't make me make it.<eos> I wish I had that much power.<eos> You do.
But it was only during your interview that Miss Hapstall claimed to hear anything that night, which I can only assume means that you fed her the information.<eos> Your honor, it's just been brought to my attention that the dash-cam audio was not in discovery.<eos> Because it's exculpatory evidence that the D.A. didn't want us to hear.<eos> So you're admitting the recording wasn't in discovery, Miss Keating?<eos> All I know is that it showed up on my desk.<eos> Pardon my French, your honor, but bull.<eos> My suspicions are raised, too, Miss Keating.<eos> Do I need to open an investigation into how you obtained this recording?<eos> You wanted evidence to discredit Helena's testimony, and I've given it to you, your honor. - By obtaining it illegally.<eos> - I did nothing illegal.
So I'm going to be honest with you. If you don't tell me who hired you, if you don't tell me where she is, then<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do with you.<eos> But I can promise you, it will be slow and it will be very ugly.<eos> Your wife, Ginny.<eos> I just did what she asked. What? She hired me.<eos> She wanted a new identity, so I put her in that cabin.<eos> Before I could get the paperwork ready, a new identity, a group of men showed up.<eos> Who were they?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But she did.
He said he went to the first two, nothing came of 'em, so the third one kind of seemed pointless.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, I'm gonna call him.<eos> They need us upstairs, bro.<eos> What?<eos> You were engaged twice?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before Wendy, there was Nicole.<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.

Spend weekends in bed.<eos> All right.<eos> We've both got work.<eos> Thank you for taking care of him.<eos> Anytime.<eos> Please talk to me.<eos> You should be helping Laurel prep Dale.<eos> Can I at least explain to you my version so you can hear it from me instead of Sinclair, who I assume is the one that told you?<eos> - It doesn't matter who told me.<eos> - It does.
What are you up to?<eos> Nate knows the plan.<eos> That's all you need to know.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because you asked me to.<eos> That can't be the only reason.<eos> I told you I don't expect anything from you.<eos> But shouldn't you?<eos> Because I want to be the person that... Can give you what you want.<eos> I do, but...
Sharon hates you, Dale.<eos> You're a stalker, you're pathetic, and you're fired.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> For helping you win the case.<eos> You want the trophy, it's in a box in the basement.<eos> Is this because of Frank?<eos> 'Cause out of all the terrible things that happen in that house, us being together...<eos> - I don't care that you two are screwing.<eos> - You do.
You're the one playing her spy when you should be in class.<eos> - I don't have a choice.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just...<eos> Congratulations... On the case.<eos> Look, I screwed up big time.<eos> And, yeah, I was wasted, but y-you're right.<eos> I saw them go up there, and I didn't do anything, and... Maybe that says a lot about me, about how stupid I was and how stupid I am, but I didn't know they were gonna do that.<eos> I didn't and...
- You sure?<eos> You've lied to us before.<eos> - Who do you think you are? Caleb -<eos> - You're lucky we haven't fired you yet!<eos> - You're right.<eos> We have good news, though.<eos> We're testing Philip's DNA against the sample we found at the crime scene, and if it matches,<eos> Sinclair will drop the charges against you.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - We do.
Thought you might have eloped with someone!<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Good to know you're worried.<eos> Hey.<eos> Grandma has cooked a lot.<eos> Let's eat at home, alright?<eos> Please...<eos> Alright.<eos> Does Grandma remember my name or not?<eos> Yes, she does.
That message will be passed down the chain of command.<eos> Too little too late.<eos> And you accuse me of cheap shots when he compared my family to gangsters?<eos> That was Gerry's analogy.<eos> Yeah, well, I must've missed the part where you walked it back.<eos> You wouldn't be putting out all these salacious, irrelevant details if you had a real case.<eos> This woman's story is made of cardboard.<eos> That's for a jury to decide, not me.<eos> I saw how she was hanging all over Gerry at the protest.<eos> Everyone did.
You're not in the clear by a long shot, Diana.<eos> You're so sweet to look in on me... (whispers): but not that scary.<eos> (whispering): Wait here and keep your eyes open. ♪ ♪<eos> The mountain comes to Mohammad.<eos> What's on your mind, Commissioner?<eos> You have something I want-- now I have something you want.<eos> I know what you want.<eos> You want a way to help clear your son, and you think I have that.<eos> That's right.<eos> But I don't.
I am prepared to let the chips fall.<eos> Wow.<eos> (chuckles) I've been waiting a long time for this.<eos> Frank Reagan coming to me hat in hand.<eos> I don't wear hats.<eos> Well, the price for my cooperation is a civilian oversight position with your department's training program.<eos> You're overplaying your hand, Reverend.<eos> Am I? You wouldn't give up a finger of your grip to save your own son?<eos> I don't have power.<eos> The office does.
Yes.<eos> And how did you learn this?<eos> My friend told me when he brought the gun to my house afterwards.<eos> Objection.<eos> Hearsay.<eos> This qualifies under the exception, Your Honor.<eos> I'll allow it for now, Ms. Reagan.<eos> Can you tell us the name of this friend of yours?<eos> You do know that you're still under oath?<eos> (voice breaking): I do.
- Splendid idea.<eos> - Oh, Thomas.<eos> .44 calibre.<eos> Please thank Doctor Ogden for escorting Margaret home.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Sir, did you hear anything of note?<eos> No one appears to have seen anything.<eos> - And you believe them?<eos> - No reason not to.<eos> We didn't.
- Sue, you have to tell your parents.<eos> - No, no. I am in college now.<eos> I can't just go running to my Mommy and Daddy to fix things.<eos> I have to handle this Holly thing on my own.<eos> How?<eos> Well, I think by living in my car, I am sending a pretty strong message.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> If she's gonna be in your face with her boyfriend, you're gonna be in her face with your boyfriend.<eos> - I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> - You do now, girlfriend.
- So not wolfsbane?<eos> That would have been too easy.<eos> There are a great number of poisons to consider.<eos> We need to narrow our field of search.<eos> How would you propose we begin?<eos> What if we could discern the method of delivery?<eos> It may at least help us determine whether the poison was slow or fact acting.<eos> Good.<eos> If the poison was cumulative, we would have seen damage to the organs and tissues,<eos> - which we did not.
My wife.<eos> Byron, naturally.<eos> Susan was here with her brother Matthew.<eos> Gregory is here almost every day.<eos> I can't provide deniability for anyone.<eos> Even myself.<eos> Is your wife home?<eos> No. Why?<eos> I understand she has a knowledge of poisons.<eos> As did the rest!
He will wait for me.<eos> My God.<eos> Sir, she could barely walk.<eos> I essentially had to carry her here.<eos> And I couldn't get a coherent word out of her the whole time.<eos> I wonder if we should call a doctor, sir?<eos> I dare say we should.<eos> Detective, you are a Water Pig.<eos> - Did you know that?<eos> - No George, I did not.
- Janice.<eos> She's the one that brought the high heat.<eos> She's also the one that got...<eos> May she rest in peace.<eos> I'm sorry, Ms. Franks. I appreciate you coming in.<eos> I have to ask if your husband has tried to contact you in the last 48 hours.<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> [Scoffs] See that girl sitting out there waiting for me?<eos> Your daughter.<eos> I did.
I know.<eos> He dumped a body in my church?<eos> Danny...<eos> It's Danielle Levine.<eos> Her mother reported her missing yesterday when she didn't come home from work.<eos> Same M.O.<eos> Posed body, head wound, strangulation.<eos> He's sending a message.<eos> We don't know that for sure.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Dad?<eos> Dad?<eos> Damn it!<eos> We've been here before.<eos> He needs one in the small of his back.<eos> Otherwise, the farts have nowhere to go.<eos> Here, I can do it.<eos> Oh, thanks, Greg.<eos> I don't like a hot butt.<eos> Nobody does, Dad.
That says Thanksgiving.<eos> So... how'd your dad take the news?<eos> Oh, yeah, that didn't happen.<eos> Really?<eos> He asked you to stay?<eos> Nah, it's just...<eos> The thing is, he's always been there for me, my whole life.<eos> The only person, actually.<eos> God... it's nice that you have that.<eos> 'Cause not everyone does.

Even yours.<eos> I may not understand your gift, but I have experienced it.<eos> The night they tried to burn you at the stake, you came to me in what I thought was a dream.<eos> You told me about a ritual you did to bind us together.<eos> That's how I found you.<eos> It worked?<eos> Since then I've been sensing things you've sensed and feeling things that you've felt.<eos> I wanted to bring us closer.<eos> I'm sorry, I had no right to do it.<eos> No, you didn't.
I won't lose you.<eos> But you cannot keep me in a cage, even one built with love.<eos> Did you really sign away your claim?<eos> It was the only way to end the war.<eos> Well, I quite like the new banners.<eos> Who needs the English lion anyway?<eos> Our bags are packed and our carriage awaits.<eos> We're going to Paris.<eos> I didn't know we had plans for Paris.<eos> We didn't.
Hey.<eos> Thanks for letting me borrow her.<eos> Come on.<eos> You saved my life, you know?<eos> Yeah, I get that all the time.<eos> Shut up.<eos> So how did it go?<eos> Oh, you know, I threw in a little case law here, a little due process there, and I talked it off with some exculpatory evidence.<eos> - So you won.<eos> - No, I did not.
This is my shop.<eos> Unless the sign says "open"... you're not invited.<eos> I think I was invited.<eos> I hear whispering.<eos> It's the dagger.<eos> It's calling to me.<eos> You're upset, imagining things.<eos> No, I'm not. It's here, isn't it?<eos> You have it, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
A friend.<eos> How am I supposed to trust your judgment when you bring around a friend like that?<eos> Someone who gets into fights and breaks bottles and could get us shut down?<eos> He's not a bad guy, he's just going through a rough time.<eos> His judgment's a little impaired.<eos> I don't care about his judgment.<eos> I care about yours.<eos> Which in this case was nonexistent.<eos> I know, look, I...<eos> No, you clearly don't.
We need a little female perspective.<eos> Although Tim is bringing quite a bit to the game.<eos> Not today, Tony.<eos> You two figure it out.<eos> You okay?<eos> Everything back to normal at home?<eos> Jake is safe.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> Well, that's not the only thing that matters.<eos> You do, too.
Don't... don't... you can answer, but let me just go, 'cause I don't want spoilers.<eos> Do you want to come with me?<eos> You shouldn't hear this.<eos> Yeah, I need some legal advice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, totally.<eos> They really have something special, don't they?<eos> Yeah, they do.
This is an all-hands-on-deck situation.<eos> - You with Grey again?<eos> - I'm always with Grey.<eos> Which is the problem for Callie, so I'm a nun, basically.<eos> Worship at the altar of our lady of general surgery.<eos> - That's a good choice. - Mm.<eos> You know, I tried dating an attending.<eos> It just... it doesn't work.<eos> - Prioritize according to...<eos> - Wilson does it.
I... and I didn't mean...<eos> No.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's...<eos> It'll do the job.<eos> Hang in there, Turner.<eos> God.<eos> Here I am, complaining about my butt burn.<eos> Don't do that.
You decide to stay.<eos> You decide you need me, then you decide you don't.<eos> You decide we can talk.<eos> You decide we cannot.<eos> I don't want to talk because I know what you're gonna say!<eos> You're gonna say you love me but...<eos> - You don't know what I'm going to say!<eos> - I'm pretty sure I do.<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> You don't!
Thank you for being my brother.<eos> Maybe we should, uh, all get some rest?<eos> I'll give you a lift back to your hotel.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Would you like to come with us, Sylvester?<eos> You're family.<eos> We'll see you soon, Walter.<eos> Sorry for discounting your plans for Megan as science fiction.<eos> You didn't want to lose her.<eos> Neither did we.
I'm not saying that.<eos> But when we left that arena, any feelings that I had-- they stayed there.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - What about, uh, the rest of your folks?<eos> Can you account for them?<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> Look, nobody on my team would let some thin-skinned ex-con or his wide-eyed little brother get in the way of a $50 million payout against Manny Garcia next year.<eos> We're way too smart for that.<eos> You're acting like the kid doesn't stand a chance.<eos> He doesn't.
Can you hold?<eos> No, I don't have time.<eos> And you put me on hold.<eos> Find that machine yet?<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Max is a special boy, Merri.<eos> A brilliant boy.<eos> We only have 90 minutes left.<eos> You don't think I know that?<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure you do.
- The question is, why wouldn't you?<eos> Unless you fear working closely with me.<eos> Christophe.<eos> You saw me have my conversation with Lord Narcisse, didn't you?<eos> I'm curious. Is your affair about pleasure with him, as it is with me?<eos> Or do you seek something from him?<eos> Come here.<eos> I need his vote to gain control, which I need to protect my family.<eos> But for him to give me this power, he needs to think that he has power over me.<eos> And he does.
Well, good, good.<eos> That's great.<eos> Something on your mind, bud? Yeah, I'm a little bummed about Melissa not wanting to have babies.<eos> You know, I thought we were on the same page there.<eos> I think she's still a little upset about the whole bacon thing.<eos> Then you know what?<eos> Why don't you jump in here? A little community consciousness could just change your fortunes, huh?<eos> Women love a doer.<eos> Thanks, man. Hey, you see something over there that looks like something that wire would plug into?<eos> - I don't.
Police have the assailant in custody.<eos> His name is Dr. Lionel Gray, a genetic scientist at Seoul National University...<eos> This is what we're dealing with now?<eos> Decentralized cells.<eos> We have a tonnage issue with insanity in this country.<eos> And genius insanity, which is a dangerous combination.<eos> Attacking with a genetic slime that modifies cells, turning facial skin pigments into a hideous death mask.<eos> You know Memento Mori is going to try to top this.<eos> Even though Gray is in custody.<eos> I do.
I'm not sentimental in that way.<eos> And Arthur's kept my identities fresh.<eos> Yeah, but you left DNA.<eos> I'm sure Blomfeld sequenced it already for predictive facial recognition.<eos> You all need to leave the city now.<eos> This may be the only time you ever hear this, Vega.<eos> But I couldn't agree with you more. I need to get to my apartment.<eos> No, it's too risky.<eos> Blomfeld has the weight and reach of D.I.A. behind him.<eos> Unless he doesn't.
Yeah.<eos> What about him?<eos> We need to lose him.<eos> Now, while Blomfeld's busy. - We?<eos> - I'll go first, through the women's locker room.<eos> If he follows, let me know.<eos> Pick me up out front.<eos> You got a stalker.<eos> So there's a Space Blue leaving D.C. to Barcelona in two hours. We don't have passports.<eos> Now you do.
I'm just so grateful you're okay.<eos> Is that Boden and Brett in the hallway?<eos> Yeah, but you don't have to...<eos> They can come in.<eos> Okay.<eos> How is she?<eos> I, uh... think she's still in shock.<eos> Well, she's been through a lot.<eos> She needs time to process everything.<eos> You both do.
He ain't Drax no more!<eos> All right.<eos> Together now.<eos> Let's light 'em up!<eos> Now we're cooking!<eos> Thank you, friend Rocket.<eos> You knew I could withstand the flames.<eos> Uh... Yes!<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did, friend Drax.
Mr. Jim Business!<eos> Wait, Bob, here.<eos> This is his collar.<eos> We must be going the right way.<eos> He's leaving us clues.<eos> Fine, but... (screams)<eos> Bob?<eos> You okay?<eos> Looks like you fell down.<eos> I did, Gayle.
No.<eos> No, I didn't know for sure, but she does it sometimes.<eos> Lin, I've been pulling her through the snow for the past three hours!<eos> Look, look, look, she's just upset because of Mr. Frond.<eos> What does that have to do with her ankle?<eos> Oh, she fakes injuries when she's sad.<eos> Or when she's happy.<eos> Or bored. Or injured.<eos> Oh, Lin, I hate your sister.<eos> No, you don't.
Let's get to work.<eos> Aw, man.<eos> She's a beautiful car, Mike.<eos> Oh, now, that's a birthday gift.<eos> My last birthday, Carol gave me a blood-pressure cuff.<eos> That's actually understandable given that your blood type is gravy.<eos> That is a nice-looking vehicle, Mike.<eos> I still don't get that whole old-car thing.<eos> You said you had a '65 'vette.<eos> I did -- in 1965.
Guerrero's back in the papers because of your sloppy clean-up job.<eos> Oh, there was nothing sloppy about it.<eos> And they'll never be able to trace it back to us.<eos> I was in the building when you killed him.<eos> That was simply bad timing.<eos> He would've signed those papers.<eos> Yeah, well, now, he doesn't need to.<eos> Jane Doe ties us to Daylight.<eos> I've done my job.<eos> Now, you do yours.
That is a wild guess.<eos> Or not a guess at all.<eos> I ran a handwriting analysis and it's a perfect match.<eos> She's bluffing.<eos> She couldn't have had time to run that test.<eos> That... and we found a partial print, which confirms that you're part of the ring.<eos> There's no way you have a print.<eos> I-I've never seen that book before.<eos> I didn't think we had a print for Olivia.<eos> We don't.
Murder, She Wrote.<eos> That was a very dangerous town.<eos> She was super hot when she was young, too.<eos> Not that you're hot.<eos> I wasn't saying that.<eos> I wasn't looking at that.<eos> - 'Cause I took an oath.<eos> - All right, let's go.<eos> - Oh, I made a mess of that.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you did.
We're just, um...<eos> You know, this is-is new for us.<eos> I mean, we-we can't believe that our little boy is dating.<eos> Mom. You remember when you used to want to marry me?<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Those were... Sorry... good times.<eos> Um, okay, so... to boobs.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did I just say "boobs"?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, you did.
You still go to those?<eos> Nah, not after the last one.<eos> Shambles.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nostalgia conventions aren't what they used to be.<eos> Lee Majors is going to be at the next one.<eos> The Six Million Dollar Man?<eos> Apparently, he's only worth 100 grand now.<eos> - That's why he...<eos> - BOTH: .. does the conventions.
Good luck.<eos> - We got one.<eos> - What?<eos> Remember Ginnie, the gum-chewing "goomar"?<eos> Well, she must have passed off the message to Paul Lagravanese, because this morning I got a text of an address in Far Rockaway...<eos> Guess who we found there.<eos> Troy Abate!<eos> That's two down, eight to go.<eos> All right, I got a question for you.<eos> What do Bill Gates, Justin Bieber,
They think it was Hector Salvado.<eos> You're not buying it?<eos> That boy is wild, but even he's not crazy enough to go straight after Reaper's trucks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Take care of yourself, all right? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Say hi to Scruffy Face Joe over there for me.<eos> We need to find Hector.<eos> Do you think he did it?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> They do.
Does this diaper make my butt look big?<eos> It makes your butt look the perfect size, King Julien.<eos> No, wait, your butt was already the perfect size.<eos> But this looks nice, too!<eos> And not better! Both are good!<eos> No! Great! Both are great!<eos> Don't tell me what to say, I'll say it!<eos> You look totes adorbs!<eos> Yeah! Totes magotes.<eos> I do, don't I?
Wait, what lady?<eos> ♪ Saxophone! ♪<eos> ♪ Express my emotions In ways that I can't do it verbally ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, Mo-Mo ♪<eos> ♪ King Julien ♪ [both] ♪ Don't let it end this way ♪<eos> ♪ If I could see you One more time ♪<eos> ♪ It's sorry, I would say ♪<eos> ♪ Mo-Mo, You my bro-mo ♪<eos> Do you understand what you have to do now, Julien?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
_ Stop, please!<eos> I don't know where he is!<eos> He's your brother.<eos> Of course you do.
I know.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Surprise.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> So, is this a six-month anniversary surprise?<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> - Because you didn't know.<eos> - I did.
Uh, right.<eos> CT reveals three broken points on Margot's pelvis, 2.2 centimeters between the bone.<eos> Yep, definite compression injury.<eos> She's gonna need an ex-fix to immobilize the fracture and limit the bleed.<eos> You mean it will tamponade the venous bleed?<eos> That's very impressive, doctor.<eos> You do know your ortho.<eos> I want to apologize about before.<eos> It's not that I don't respect ortho.<eos> I do.
Let's hope he sees it that way.<eos> Well, as soon as he gets through his next irate dinner tirade, he will be.<eos> Great work, Dana.<eos> - Yeah, anything else?<eos> - No.<eos> Come on, Reid.<eos> Spit it out.<eos> You've been sitting on it all day.<eos> Doctors, we have a problem.<eos> Yes, we do.
What's the code?<eos> My birthday.<eos> It's not working.<eos> It's just the four digits-- month and day.<eos> Nope.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Yeah, there.<eos> What number were youputtingin ?<eos> You don't know my birthday, do you?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah, you crashed and burned with the hair thing.<eos> You need more of that humiliation?<eos> We don't know that that would happen.<eos> Disappearing middle-class, racial unrest...<eos> You got a nice thing going here, Gloria.<eos> Enjoy it.<eos> What?<eos> You don't think that I can do it?<eos> No.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Hey, Al, how long are you and Michelle planning on staying?<eos> We love having you but just trying to get a timeframe.<eos> Do you have the business section?<eos> - How well do you know this guy?<eos> - He's a solid dude.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Dominic, meet Detective Jay Halstead.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - Works with me in Intelligence.<eos> How you doing?
- Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's not an idea.<eos> It's a demand.<eos> A loving but very specific demand.<eos> - That's what I thought.<eos> - Good.<eos> Gonna change.<eos> I don't know what this means.<eos> - Of course you don't.
Noah?<eos> So you say you called her boyfriend?<eos> Peter.<eos> He's more like a friend.<eos> They've known each other since pre-K.<eos> He hadn't seen or heard from Lily all day.<eos> Is this her iPad?<eos> What's the password?<eos> She doesn't have a password.<eos> Yeah, she does.
That's not right, Robby.<eos> - That's not right.<eos> - No.<eos> - She was taunting you.<eos> - Bad.<eos> That made you mad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't like that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No one does, Robby.
I load soda machines at the complex.<eos> I see her every day.<eos> She's cute.<eos> She'd even smile at me.<eos> You were hoping you two could be friends.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd smile, ask her if she could give me a smile back.<eos> Okay. And last week?<eos> I asked her if she wanted a soda, a Vitamin Water, something.<eos> And she did?
Come on!<eos> We need security at Santa's Village.<eos> Code Blitzen.<eos> Code Blitzen.<eos> No code Blitzen, no code Blitzen!<eos> BOB: Louise, it's okay.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> Santa stopped giving you presents ages ago.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You really don't, Bob.
I have done this many times before.<eos> Aren't we brimming with confidence.<eos> And my work here is done.<eos> Bravo.<eos> Ah, Jethro, you're just in time for Mr. Palmer's unveiling.<eos> What's going on?<eos> As you can see, I've been running a-fowl.<eos> Oh, it's classic.<eos> You have something for me?<eos> We do.
In exchange for my bone marrow, I want my life sentence reduced to time served.<eos> I want to walk out of here a free man.<eos> Open up.<eos> I knew Sean was mixed up in something.<eos> But I never imagined this.<eos> He went to the FBI.<eos> He was trying to do the right thing.<eos> And it got him shot.<eos> Do you have children, Agent Gibbs?<eos> I did.
God, I wish it wasn't though.<eos> (Elizabeth) All right, thanks.<eos> Jared's out on bail, and it looks like<eos> - his lawyer made a deal.<eos> - What are the terms?<eos> The terms are he'll be off completely if he puts together a list of everyone involved in the dealing.<eos> So, basically he's gonna rat his way out of it.<eos> - (Elizabeth) Sounds that way.<eos> - Hey, we don't know for sure he's gonna give you up.<eos> We don't?
That's much better.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And I guess I should thank you for saving my life too, huh?<eos> You may want to wait a couple weeks.<eos> See if you still feel grateful.<eos> So, we'll be taking that tainted Utopium now.<eos> Yeah, some bad news on that front.<eos> You said he knew where to find it.<eos> No, he...<eos> He does...
What... What is a thyroid storm?<eos> A side effect of thyroid meds is weight loss.<eos> Sometimes patients abuse those meds to get thin, but the excessive hormones in the blood can reach toxic levels.<eos> It's called a thyroid storm.<eos> It can cause heart failure and abnormal rhythms.<eos> Aubrey, we've noticed from your medical records that you've lost quite a few pounds over the last year.<eos> From diet and exercise.<eos> You don't have a prescription for thyroid medication, but we've known some girls to sneak their mom's pills.<eos> Do you have a prescription, Mrs. Clark?<eos> Yes, I do.
I hit the wrong thing.<eos> Han!<eos> Han, do over!<eos> My insides are on fire!<eos> I love Wednesdays.<eos> I get to erase all the genitalia that was drawn on the cupcake board.<eos> And I love Thursdays 'cause I get to redraw them.<eos> I need some more paper towels.<eos> Oh, I think they're downstairs.<eos> Max, you do fake stairs so well.
So... You're protecting them -- keen and reddington?<eos> Samar, i know about the search on my computer.<eos> He was missing.<eos> So you knew where they were, and you didn't tell me. She couldn't,<eos> After mr. Reddington helped with her brother.<eos> That's not why i did it. It's not?<eos> You said --<eos> If we bring liz in, she will die.<eos> First cooper tipped them off about wing yee, And now you're protecting them. Cooper didn't tip them off.<eos> I did.
Your real name.<eos> Kenneth.<eos> Now look what you've done.<eos> You spilled all the tea, dear.<eos> You have to tell me your real name.<eos> They're gonna hurt me if you don't.<eos> You like getting hurt, jilly.<eos> You wouldn't be here with them if you didn't.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do.
I can't say I've done much.<eos> Until drugs corrupted the hell out of it, it was a great sport.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> It's one of the few sports that focuses on a team of individuals.<eos> You see, the cyclist needs the rest of his team to get out in front, provide a wake, so he can draft on them.<eos> I'm not sure I follow.<eos> You want Squad Three to be the best squad in the city, right?<eos> I do.<eos> And you have an idea, a vision, on how to make that happen, I assume?<eos> Of course you do.
- Okay.<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> - It's not even on.<eos> - You're kidding me.<eos> Nope. Huh.<eos> Well... I might be losing my mind, but thank you, and you are not leaving here without pouring yourself a thank you drink.<eos> Uh, I'm on duty.<eos> So as much as I would love to, I'm gonna pass.<eos> You don't want to break the rules a little?<eos> No, I don't.
Hey, Connie!<eos> You know where Chief is?<eos> Pulling up now.<eos> - Just what he needs.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Hey, Chief, can we get a minute with you?<eos> What's up?<eos> Remember when we all went to see Aerosmith<eos> - back in 2001?<eos> - I do.
Is she a friend of yours?<eos> A good one.<eos> We served together on the Daniel Webster.<eos> Matter of fact, she assisted on your surgery.<eos> You comfortable, Agent Gibbs?<eos> Tony, you remember Dr. Taft.<eos> Mm, the man, the myth, the legend.<eos> Nice work, Doc.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Gibbs did his part.
Uh... for me?<eos> Eleanor, has it not occurred to you that you are now running point?<eos> Well... maybe by default.<eos> Uh, only until Gibbs gets back.<eos> Which might not be long.<eos> Morning, Gibbs.<eos> Bishop, sitrep.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Ducky found something that...<eos> No, I didn't.
When the bad men came, Bahar, you were here?<eos> I helping Dr. Liz.<eos> No lights to see.<eos> She fight bad men and they shoot.<eos> Shoot more, take others.<eos> They took David?<eos> Dr. David and Joni-- they took them?<eos> Who took them-- what bad men?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Sure you do.
You should be happy for yourself, too.<eos> You don't have to carry around all that guilt anymore.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> It's all been such a blur, I haven't had a chance to say thank you.<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> And you're welcome.<eos> Thank you, Tony.<eos> I owe you.<eos> No, you don't.
Let you know I went rogue.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Why should you NCIS agents have all the fun?<eos> I made a few calls, found a doctor who treated a man for Argyria.<eos> Blue tattoo that wasn't a blue tattoo.<eos> Yes, ma'am, Pride told me.<eos> Turns out the good doctor treated a patient while that patient was serving time in prison.<eos> Ed Tagget.<eos> Arrested 2006 for armed robbery in Georgia.<eos> Did time from 2007 to 2015.
See?<eos> You're golden.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sure.<eos> What did I just tell her not to worry about?<eos> She's getting herself all worked up about this brouhaha with the boss.<eos> She actually thinks he might be putting in his papers.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You don't think he's done, do you?<eos> You do?
Is anyone even listening to me?<eos> Anyway, just get your head together.<eos> OK, and have a long, hard think about yourself.<eos> I mean, married to a drunk!<eos> Pardon.<eos> - My tits hurt.<eos> - Get over here.<eos> They hate us here.<eos> We're scum!<eos> No, they don't.
Oh my gosh.<eos> Danger, danger, he found me.<eos> I'm right over here and he's looking at me.<eos> Mike, I'm so sorry about what about to happen to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Mike, I really wish I could say yes.<eos> You're an amazing man, but it wouldn't be fair.<eos> You deserve someone who is all in.<eos> We both do.
The blackout could be the Chernobyl of the power grid.<eos> Okay, I know that we can't divulge stuff, but I didn't know we'd moved on to spinning each other.<eos> I'm just giving you what the White House's official position is.<eos> Okay, let's try this:<eos> If it was us, was it in response to what happened on Air Force One?<eos> Solar flares happened on Air Force One.<eos> I was read in to that one.<eos> I know about the malware.<eos> Well... but not who was behind it, because we didn't know.<eos> And we do now?
I wanted to find you, but I guess you found me first.<eos> I know you, don't I?<eos> Uh, you remember?<eos> You were pretty small back then.<eos> I was the governor of Lothal.<eos> I supported your parents and the messages they beamed out against the Empire.<eos> It was part of the reason I was accused of treason and sent to prison with them.<eos> I do remember.<eos> Then you know what happened to them.<eos> Yes, I do.

Here's my question for you.<eos> Reason I got in touch.<eos> Whose money did she use to make that down payment?<eos> 'Cause if it's yours, you can just call the bank and void the check, right?<eos> No, we don't have a joint account.<eos> If she wrote a check, it's her money.<eos> What kind of married people don't share a fucking bank account?<eos> We're not married.<eos> I thought you had a kid together.<eos> We do. Oh. Another?
We're not married.<eos> I thought you had a kid together.<eos> We do. Oh. Another?<eos> Yeah, another, both of us.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't understand why she'd do something like that without telling me.<eos> Really?<eos> Really?<eos> You don't?
Noah can I say something you might not want to hear?<eos> When we were younger, you'd wash up on my front door.<eos> I would've just seen you the night before or something.<eos> Your troubles, they were just a part of the scrum of our lives.<eos> We had everything in between...<eos> school, career, friends.<eos> I'd see you, what, three times a week?<eos> But now, Noah, I got to be honest, um, it feels like it's only the washing-up part, like there is no in-between.<eos> - Okay, do you want me to leave?<eos> - No, I don't.
I knew you'd ask that.<eos> - Well, are you?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> You have to trust me, Noah.<eos> I want to do this for myself.<eos> I don't want to be a doctor.<eos> No?<eos> You don't?
What, Luisa?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I find that hard to imagine. Why...<eos> No, she says she's affected by the cycles of the moon, which I thought was bullshit, but she's right.<eos> I mean, every full moon, she's like... she's completely emotional; she makes no sense.<eos> Okay, well, that's only a few days a month.<eos> She can't have kids.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
It's just... I...<eos> That wasn't the deal, Alison.<eos> You were coming out here till Labor Day, helping fix the place up, and then come home.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> - That was the deal.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> - Well, I want you to come home.<eos> I want to raise Joanie together.<eos> I want to get married.<eos> Do you?
Of course, don't you?<eos> I...<eos> Come on, Alison.<eos> I love you.<eos> You love me.<eos> We got a kid together.<eos> Let's stop making things so difficult for ourselves.<eos> Let's get married and settle down, be happy, be normal, raise a family.<eos> Isn't that what you want?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
What's going on?<eos> Lily Coleman's grandmother called yesterday.<eos> Lily never came home.<eos> She's missing.<eos> Will your lawyer be joining us, Mr. Donovan?<eos> I don't need my damn lawyer.<eos> I just need y'all to let me up out of here.<eos> Well, the judge has ruled that you'll remain in custody pending the result of the new trial.<eos> You got nothing shows I killed those people.<eos> You never did.
That's not the point, Jared.<eos> It is the point, people party.<eos> It is not on us.<eos> Just... hey, you just gotta take a breath.<eos> All right, we need to make a plan for what to say if the cops have questions.<eos> Well, I was thinking we would just tell the truth.<eos> Or we stick as close to the truth as possible.<eos> All right, first they're gonna ask<eos> - if we had permits and security.<eos> - Which we did.
If you're looking for Carter, she's not here.<eos> No, we came to talk to you.<eos> There's nothing left to talk about, especially not to a cop.<eos> So what, you're just gonna run?<eos> That's your big plan?<eos> Worked for you, didn't it?<eos> Ben, let us help you.<eos> No, you can't help me, all right?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- You can e-mail me.<eos> - OK, uh, so w-when...?<eos> - Just e-mail me.<eos> OK.<eos> Is your e-mail address still ImpatientShithead@Mean.jerk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Is yours still FatIdiot@BadBreath.cunt?<eos> - I don't have bad breath.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
So, he died on impact.<eos> No surprises there.<eos> Jane...<eos> Jane...<eos> According to his GP, he was on antidepressants.<eos> You never call me Jane.<eos> I had a word with Steve's best mate, Matt.<eos> Now he hadn't seen Steve, but Steve did call him.<eos> He was upset.<eos> Something to do with that girl, that one with no name.
Is it cool if I drop off Roscoe an hour early this Friday?<eos> Sure.<eos> Candace and I are going out to celebrate the anniversary of our first date.<eos> Great.<eos> I got us a room at the Wine Country Inn.<eos> Nice.<eos> It's a package deal.<eos> Champagne brunch, couple's massage in the room.<eos> Don't care, Baxter.<eos> Yeah, you do.
For once, put yourself in my shoes.<eos> The mall's about to close.<eos> I just need to grab something for two kids who are either six or, uh... maybe they're 15?<eos> You are a terrible father.<eos> Hey, I know you.<eos> You're Rebecca's neighbor, right?<eos> - I met you at her party. - Oh.<eos> You got really drunk, and then you slow-danced with that giant fish. Oh.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> No, it did...
Hockey's a red meat sport.<eos> (Laughs) Oh, Michael.<eos> You would never put tofu in the dairy case.<eos> Leave all your huggy, organic crap outside the rink, okay?<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll coach the way I coach.<eos> Just spitballing here, but we want just the opposite of that.<eos> You know, why are we even having this conversation?<eos> We don't have a sponsor?<eos> Oh, yeah, we do. Huh?
He wanted to watch me jump rope.<eos> It got really weird.<eos> He took me to the Dodger game, and he wanted to hold my hand the whole time.<eos> - Oh, I know...<eos> - He keeps tousling my hair, and this takes a lot of work.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I saw this coming.<eos> He just wants to know that you appreciate him.<eos> - Well...<eos> - We do.
Forgiveness for what?<eos> For not telling you something I should've told you a long time ago.<eos> And I fully recognize this is the most bizarre of circumstances and the weirdest timing to have this conversation.<eos> What conversation, exactly?<eos> The whole Internal Affairs investigation.<eos> I... was trying to protect you and trying to protect NCIS, because... because John Quinn didn't kill Boyle.<eos> I did, and I did it to protect Tiffany.<eos> I know.<eos> What do you mean you know?<eos> No, you don't.
You know what I love, Mr. Maddox?<eos> I love the sound of a bird singing.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> In the morning, you first wake up, and there is this little tweedle-dee, tweedle-dee out your window.<eos> It just... it just warms you up inside.<eos> Serena Holmes.<eos> Serena Holmes is singing like a bird.<eos> She's telling us how you paid her to frame Wallace Boden, how you stowed her away at a fancy inn at Lake Carlyle, how you told her to stay hidden until you can get her out of the country.<eos> That sounds like the delusions of a woman with an axe to grind.<eos> No, sir, it doesn't.
Honey, we got to get the key back from Matt.<eos> My whole life. Hmm?<eos> I have never been better than Matt at anything<eos> - except losing.<eos> - Honey.<eos> You are successful.<eos> You're a great father.<eos> You have a beautiful, intelligent, tolerant wife.<eos> You don't need this stupid Ping-Pong game to prove yourself.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Maybe they didn't want him to finish this.<eos> "Dear Peter and Molly, this is the hardest note..."<eos> I didn't think people wrote letters any more.<eos> I guess they do if it's important.<eos> Any sign of forced entry?<eos> No.<eos> I think he knew the killer pretty well.<eos> He must have dropped this in the struggle.<eos> Do you know who it belongs to?<eos> I do.
Did we?<eos> Of course.<eos> That's crazy!<eos> We didn't do it.<eos> I don't touch drunk girls.<eos> Whatever happened last night, didn't happen. Okay?<eos> So we're not dating?<eos> Dating?<eos> You said, let's date.<eos> I did?
Really.<eos> - JANG Yu-jin!<eos> - Yes?<eos> I'll take good care of JS.<eos> Dear? Promise?<eos> - What?<eos> You don't trust me?<eos> - Stamp!<eos> - You don't believe me?<eos> - Of course I do!
This TV worked perfectly when it left the store, so we're not responsible.<eos> Not responsible?<eos> I spent $640 on this thing.<eos> Then you should've sprung the extra five on the warranty. [chortles]<eos> Let me tell you something, you goddamn son of a bitch.<eos> - Now, Frank...<eos> - "Now Frank, now Frank" nothing!<eos> I am gonna speak!<eos> You think you can put on slacks and talk to a grown man like that?<eos> Well, do ya?
Yes, he said she was a passenger on a recent flight he'd piloted.<eos> Was that true?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Were Dr. Portnow and Ms. Van Gaal on a flight together?<eos> I don't believe so.<eos> You don't believe so?<eos> Didn't you check it?<eos> I did.<eos> So don't you know it not to be true?<eos> - I do.
Used to.<eos> Then I really got into Brutal Mercy.<eos> Which is where you connected with the defendant.<eos> Yeah, TheAlgea.<eos> Yeah, that's his screen name.<eos> The Greek spirits of pain and suffering.<eos> I liked that.<eos> You also liked his plan to "KSR" Lucy Van Gaal.<eos> I did.<eos> I still do.
Nope.<eos> Better.<eos> Okay, you guys are kind of freaking me out with the "cat that ate the canary" looks.<eos> What's better than corruption?<eos> Try murdering Russia's beloved president.<eos> Murder?<eos> A-As in... murder?<eos> Pavel Ostrov<eos> - had an embolism.<eos> - He did.
-[man] Because that's not what she said.<eos> And I object to the form.<eos> [Kelly] Why don't you guys all just get sworn and testify here?<eos> -Let the witness answer.<eos> -[man] I didn't--<eos> I'm not stopping the witness from answering.<eos> [Kelly] You're trying to tell her what to say.<eos> [man] When you said, "You said this," and she didn't say that,<eos> -I'm gonna object...<eos> -[Kelly] Yes, she did.
What do you mean "if"?<eos> Well, I mean there's some factors involved.<eos> Like, what kind of factors?<eos> Like, it's a three-month commitment, Hailey.<eos> I know.<eos> You told me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, that's really lame, but I think that you should do it.<eos> This is a really good opportunity for you.<eos> You do?
Cyn, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Sure.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Excuse us, Counselor.<eos> Well, I wonder what that makes us, Mr. Pembridge.<eos> Since when?<eos> It started a couple of weeks before we left on tour.<eos> Look, it really has nothing to do with you.<eos> Yes, it does.
- That's how you do it.<eos> - Adagio, Andrew, adagio.<eos> I don't want everybody feeling too good about themselves.<eos> Ha ha. My apologies, Maestro.<eos> Gentlemen, I take back everything I just said, but may I tell you, sir, your performance tonight was magnificent.<eos> Oh, thank you, Andrew.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm so pleased that you're putting a nice, fresh coat of paint on this old vessel.<eos> Oh, you know how it is.<eos> - I do.
Step in and finish your sentence?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Thank you, boss.<eos> Howler monkey?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> You know, primates are fascinating.<eos> I've been watching a lot of Discovery Channel.<eos> Did you know that...<eos> That there's a dead Marine in an alley?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Exactly.<eos> Thank you, boss.<eos> Howler monkey?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> You know, primates are fascinating.<eos> I've been watching a lot of Discovery Channel.<eos> Did you know that...<eos> That there's a dead Marine in an alley?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> And now you do, too.
It must have something to do with this letter.<eos> Abby wants to analyze it, see if she can figure out the connection.<eos> I hope I'm not interrupting.<eos> Hi, Ellie.<eos> You got a sec?<eos> Should I be preparing for another crime scene?<eos> Hey, I'm sorry to ambush you at work like this, but we need to talk.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're right.<eos> We do.
We have no idea what he was doing there.<eos> I do want to warn you, though.<eos> Nicholas is happy, but he has no recollection of his former life and hasn't for years.<eos> I think you may have dropped this.<eos> I thought you might be looking for it.<eos> Hello, Nicholas.<eos> You got my letter.<eos> You found me, Donnie.<eos> You found me.<eos> I did, that.
And he blamed me.<eos> But Dan... He were just a kid, you know?<eos> Mr G's... That's Eddie's brother's club.<eos> So... This Eddie came to Manchester looking for you.<eos> Dan must have thought that Eddie would get to me in prison.<eos> And he worked out a plan to get me out.<eos> But Eddie got to Dan first.<eos> But I spoke to Dan.<eos> Yeah, Dave.<eos> But you did... Not me.
We don't have to get married - No, look, it's not -<eos> ..what's scaring you.<eos> It's not us.<eos> It's just - I just don't feel like I'm in control of anything.<eos> Control. Can't you just be happy with what you've got?<eos> You know, do you really wanna start again?<eos> A new career at your age.<eos> You love being a copper.<eos> I used to.<eos> No, you do.
Really, probably more important even than the closings.<eos> Because by the time they get to that point, um... it's gonna be a matter of arguing for a few of them probably.<eos> I think most of them will probably have already decided.<eos> So we want to get 'em early.<eos> Just get 'em thinking that there's another side to this they have not heard.<eos> All they've been hearing, for what, 15 months, is, you know, Teresa Halbach was burned.<eos> Bones were found on Steven Avery's property.<eos> Which is a horrible fact.<eos> But what they don't know is that there's evidence those bones were moved.<eos> And so... And neither does the media.
- And how was that done?<eos> My daughter Nikole brought her cell phone along and we...<eos> I should back up.<eos> Ryan gave us a direct line to Sheriff Pagel in case we found something.<eos> So I called Sheriff Pagel.<eos> And I said, "I think I found the vehicle."<eos> [Kratz] How long from when you entered that property did it take you to find Teresa's vehicle?<eos> I believed we entered at ten to ten... and by 10:20 to 10:25, we had found the vehicle.<eos> Ms. Sturm, do you know how many vehicles are on this property?<eos> I didn't at the time.
Shooting rabbits.<eos> The mere existence of shells without a link to a particular body doesn't prove anything, does it?<eos> It could've been. You know, we just...<eos> No. We didn't know.<eos> OK, so in short, then, by March 1st and March 2nd... when those search warrants were issued... four months of investigation had found not one shred of Teresa Halbach's DNA anywhere in Mr. Avery's trailer or garage.<eos> Correct.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you remember on that first search a note with Ms. Halbach's phone number being seized<eos> - from Mr. Avery's computer table?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Like Mr. Fassbender asked.<eos> - There were reasons why...<eos> - I'll get to that.<eos> My point is this:<eos> this is the only time in your entire career you have ever filed a deviation of protocol so that you could make a call and include somebody, isn't it?<eos> The deviation that I requested was appropriate for this situation.<eos> - It was OK'd and it was reported.<eos> - But, ma'am... you did not disclose in that report, that official report, that courts and juries and judges and lawyers and everybody else relies on, you did not disclose that in order to make that call,<eos> you had to do something so rare, you've never done it before, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
[Buting] Let's talk about some specific results we haven't heard.<eos> Gonna put on exhibit 237 right now.<eos> See that crack that sort of runs north-south?<eos> Law enforcement actually took a jack hammer and tore up concrete chunks, right?<eos> That was my understanding.<eos> [Buting] And they did that because they thought,<eos> "Well, if the victim had been killed here, perhaps her blood would've soaked into those cracks," right?<eos> I assume so.<eos> Did you find Teresa Halbach's DNA on any of those swabs?<eos> No, I did not.
- All right.<eos> Do you remember talking to a couple of law enforcement officers about this back on, uh...<eos> November 29, 2005?<eos> Yes.<eos> And do you remember what you told them then about when you got home from the hospital?<eos> No, I don't recall.<eos> I'll show you exhibit 356, which is a Division of Criminal Investigation report.<eos> The second paragraph may be the most helpful, which you're welcome to read to yourself, any or all of that report.<eos> - Did that help refresh your recollection?<eos> - Yeah, it did.
[Buting] One of the things that the State argued was that it would've taken a wide ranging conspiracy of so many people to pull this off and that there's just no way this could be possible.<eos> But in fact, that's not true.<eos> Really, two people could've done this easily enough if they had the motive to do it.<eos> Maybe one, even.<eos> And the whole argument, "Well, why would they risk doing this and risk getting caught?"<eos> You have to understand, they probably would have no fear of ever being caught doing this.<eos> You know? Who better than a police officer would know how to frame somebody?<eos> [bailiff] Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give in the matter now before the court be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Yes.<eos> -And to tell your uncle not to do it?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -You made that up?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Mr. Dassey, didn't you tell your mother in a phone call on May 13th that you had gone over to your uncle Steven's after school<eos> -and before she came home?<eos> -Yes.<eos> And on May 15th, she's asking you why you didn't tell her.<eos> Why didn't you?
- Probably Steven.<eos> - No, not "probably." Who did?<eos> If you know, you need to tell me.<eos> You were over there.<eos> - Steven did.<eos> - Did you see him do it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.
- No, not "probably." Who did?<eos> If you know, you need to tell me.<eos> You were over there.<eos> - Steven did.<eos> - Did you see him do it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.<eos> If you didn't, good.
Fixed.<eos> Dinner time.<eos> Give me the plate.<eos> Ok.<eos> Today's meal for the Winter solstice is prepared by Aunt Mui and I.<eos> Hey! You can eat first for the other days.<eos> Hey! Quick! Don't want to do it?<eos> Where are Ping, Little Guizi and Lung?<eos> Bill, did you tell them?<eos> I did.
Hi, Cho Rim.<eos> You're here early.<eos> The sous chef told me to come in early today.<eos> He said you were working on a recipe overnight and there's a lot to clean up.<eos> I see.<eos> Did you stay up all night?<eos> You must be very tired.<eos> Do you need me to do anything?<eos> Do you know how to brew coffee?<eos> Yes, I do.
Nothing else has it in this store.<eos> Only the walls.<eos> When did you open this store?<eos> It's been a week.<eos> So I assume it was a curry restaurant a week ago.<eos> That's right.<eos> My brother used to run a curry restaurant here, but he had to go abroad abruptly.<eos> So I took over the lease and opened a shoe store.<eos> Do you have pictures of the curry restaurant?<eos> Of course I do.
Why did Lieutenant Yeom get kidnapped?<eos> Why did Kwon Jae Hee kidnap her?<eos> Why did Kwon Jae Hee kidnap Lieutenant Yeom?<eos> Lieutenant was wearing the same clothes as you.<eos> But you really are wearing the same clothes as Oh Cho Rim!<eos> You never know.<eos> So you're thinking that Kwon Jae Hee won't recognize you... if you're wearing the same clothes and similar hairstyle as Cho Rim?<eos> We'll be able to get him when he's confounded.<eos> Does Cho Rim know that you're wearing the same clothes?<eos> She doesn't.
Any idea how we'll do that?<eos> You guys have to hook up with them.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> - "You guys"?<eos> - I'm not hooking up!<eos> Okay, so we'll hook up. What will you contribute?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I'm rescuing you here with a strategic plan and you're wondering what I'll contribute?<eos> Does anyone have a boyfriend?<eos> I do.
Since you were best friends with my girl, it was a big risk to take.<eos> If it didn't go well, it would have been really weird.<eos> So I just waited for a sign.<eos> What kind of sign?<eos> A sign that I should kiss you.<eos> And you know the Take Me to Church song they played all the time?<eos> Yes.<eos> I kept thinking if that was the next song that came on, I should go for it.<eos> So did it come on?<eos> No, it didn't.
-I'm full.<eos> Thanks for the meal.<eos> -Thanks for the meal.<eos> -Thanks for the meal. -So, for now, as a plan, we'll go with that.<eos> I'm gonna go do my laundry.<eos> I'll...<eos> You do it every day.<eos> Teach me.<eos> Sure.<eos> You do a lot of laundry, Makocchan.
-It was really smelly.<eos> -She said it was smelly.<eos> -It was stinky.<eos> No, really?<eos> -It was really smelly.<eos> -That's trouble.<eos> I'm screwed.<eos> Oh, you're done.<eos> I didn't say it.<eos> Oh, you did.
-Their silhouettes are starting to show.<eos> -Yes, slowly.<eos> -We start from here.<eos> -From here.<eos> That's the most romantic laundry room ever.<eos> That's true.<eos> Yes, two washing machines in the dark.<eos> He was saying something there. You know...<eos> Yes, about Yuriko.<eos> Yes, Tatsuya did.
I just wondered about her.<eos> Remember, at first,<eos> -all of us liked Makocchan?<eos> -We did.<eos> The other day, I brought trouble to you and Uchi.<eos> I thought my feelings might change after that incident.<eos> -Toward Makocchan? -Yeah, yeah.<eos> But they didn't change.<eos> -I see.<eos> -They didn't.
"I don't think Uchi thinks that way."<eos> Something like that.<eos> So I thought if Minori said so, it must be true.<eos> After I heard that, I thought maybe I was overreacting.<eos> And so, now, I have no feelings for her. I liked her at first, but...<eos> Nothing. How do I put this?<eos> But, Makocchan, I thought you liked Minori, so I'm...<eos> -Really?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Well, I did, but... I did...
Why don't you sew the sides?<eos> What about the string?<eos> You can make a hole for it later.<eos> I want to sew it on, too.<eos> -You're gonna sew it on?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> For Minori<eos> - A "present" Let's go running again!<eos> - Makoto<eos> -You're doing it.
Most excitedly.<eos> But you don't appear to be taking any notes.<eos> Is there something you'd like to contribute?<eos> Well, come on, then.<eos> Come on!<eos> You'll need the chalk.<eos> But I... I hadn't completed that proof.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just do.
What the devil is that, anyway?<eos> Partitions.<eos> No, no, no, wait.<eos> This even you could understand.<eos> P of 4 equals 5.<eos> Now, all that means is there are five ways to add up the number 4.<eos> 1+1+1+1, 3+1, 2+1+1, 2 + 2, and 4.<eos> Seems simple enough.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So it does.
Let me ask you something.<eos> How does all this come to you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why am I bothering with a Council meeting when I'm getting the boot?<eos> If you think I'm gonna have that charlatan for a Fellow, you're very much mistaken.<eos> Please tell me you didn't propose him.<eos> He's gonna crack partitions.<eos> He's worthy.<eos> You're the one who told me to let him run like a damn horse.<eos> Well, I did.
His originality has been a constant source of suggestion to me ever since I first met him.<eos> And his death is one of the worst blows I have ever felt.<eos> But now I say to myself when I'm depressed, and I find myself forced to listen to tiresome and pompous people,<eos> "Well, I've done something you could never have done.<eos> "I have collaborated with both Littlewood and Ramanujan "on something like equal terms."<eos> Let's take this one.<eos> What?<eos> 1729.<eos> I don't see what's so special about this one.<eos> Neither did I at first.
Gerda, I want to be a woman, not a painter.<eos> Well, people have been known to do both.<eos> I'm curious to see what you would paint.<eos> That's all.<eos> Sometimes it's hard to know what's in your...<eos> Didn't you just take one of those a minute ago?<eos> Gerda, I know what I'm doing.<eos> I'm just going to get some fresh air.<eos> You know, sometimes I do wonder why you let me go through all this, if you thought that everything would be the same afterwards.<eos> I didn't.
He's coming home to meet Victor Ha.<eos> What?<eos> Victor, I beg you.<eos> I had hoped to shield you from this.<eos> Lisa, I told you I'm fine with seeing Ryan.<eos> Fine with seeing Ryan with his new girlfriend?<eos> Also, Ryan has a new girlfriend.<eos> Ryan has a girlfriend?<eos> Ryan has a girlfriend.<eos> Of course he does.

It's quite urgent.<eos> My husband is coming home soon and he loves to play the piano.<eos> PIANO TUNING HANDBOOK<eos> Comrade, who are you looking for?<eos> Is this Teacher Yu's residence?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm the piano tuner.<eos> Piano tuner?<eos> Didn't you call for a piano tuner?<eos> Oh, yes, I did.
"Please send her my birthday wishes.<eos> "I am her father, "yet I was never around for her.<eos> "It's the biggest regret of my life.<eos> "I still remember "how you didn't want her to become a dancer.<eos> "You said only science and technology "could make a meaningful contribution to our country."<eos> It's true.<eos> Back then I was against it.<eos> And now?<eos> Does she still dance?<eos> Yes, she does.
We will come by, and take a look as soon as we can.<eos> Great.<eos> Yeah, maybe you should go to this one... alone.<eos> Why?<eos> You know what you're looking for anyway.<eos> You don't need me.<eos> It's the whole Manhattan thing, isn't it?<eos> Why would I care if you moved to Manhattan?<eos> - I don't know. Why would you?<eos> - I don't.
- What do you got?<eos> - Shaun Manning's aunt's phone records.<eos> It shows at least a dozen calls to our new favorite pizza joint.<eos> It's funny, Gino never mentioned that.<eos> And he said Manning wasn't looking for a job.<eos> By the way, that is a lot of calls, just to bug someone to hire you.<eos> Which is why I also checked Gino's phone line too.<eos> See if anyone called Manning back.<eos> I'm thinking, if it's not about a job, maybe we find the person who's helping him hide out.<eos> - And did you?
Do you recognize this man?<eos> Why?<eos> Who is he?<eos> His name is Bobby Cordero, I think he's the man who attacked you in the park that night.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Sorry, never saw him before.<eos> - Are you sure? - Detective, I have said, I don't remember anything from that day.<eos> Do you understand whay "anything" means?<eos> I do.
Here you are in my house, and I've not even properly introduced myself.<eos> My name is Skylar.<eos> I don't care to know your name.<eos> Well, now, who's forgotten their manners?<eos> What gives you the right to come into my house, threatening, making accusations, when I haven't done anything wrong?<eos> That's illegal, Miss Meadows.<eos> The truth is not illegal.<eos> Hey.<eos> You have no idea what it's like to have to start over again.<eos> - I most certainly do.
You've sacked the butler, have you, dear?<eos> Foreign Office?<eos> Crowe's cabal in the Foreign Office?<eos> -Just you and Crowe?<eos> -Please, Margot.<eos> -One sugar or two.<eos> Diplomacy, all those silken phrases.<eos> Why don't you just come out and say what you mean for once?<eos> Why don't you say what you mean when you see a friend wearing a dress you don't like?<eos> She does.
Well, I would rather think the Kaiser would wish to retain that prerogative.<eos> It would be an excellent thing if Russia could be encouraged to move to a general mobilisation.<eos> Get all her men in the field.<eos> We will see it one day, whether we like it or not.<eos> Rather it happens now than in five or ten years' time, when the scales tip towards Russia.<eos> Think of all this double track railway line laid through Poland, coming our way.<eos> Theirs is a partial mobilisation, Not a general one.<eos> But a general one wouldn't be difficult to provoke, would it?<eos> I always expected to lose your magic powers when we deprive you of those.<eos> We do!
Okay.<eos> Oh, why do you even bother?<eos> I won--I won that piece of junk in a poker game.<eos> It kicked on me years ago.<eos> Car needs oil, Dad.<eos> Well, I put oil in that car.<eos> Where?<eos> In--In the oil hole.<eos> Why aren't you working, Dad?<eos> Oh, I did... work.
That's... just between us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Let's see.<eos> This just slides.<eos> Okay.<eos> How are things with your grandmother?<eos> Uh, she keeps nagging me.<eos> But I have two interviews next week.<eos> You do?
No, I'm... I'm freezing my eggs.<eos> Cryopreservation.<eos> Do they pay you a lot?<eos> No, I'm freezing my eggs for myself.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I might want to have a baby one day.<eos> So you don't have a boyfriend?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
He was.<eos> His car.<eos> I swear, if Spencer was there, she would've pegged him with her jelly beans.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> But seriously. You cannot hold onto this.<eos> Spencer was just trying to protect you.<eos> No, she was trying to control the situation.<eos> Like she always does.<eos> Emily, look, she thought that you were making a mistake.<eos> I did.
No, not alone.<eos> Emily said she'd come.<eos> Emily?<eos> I don't think of her as a tomboy.<eos> She isn't.<eos> I used to be a real tomboy.<eos> I would spend more time in the tree in our front yard than I would in my own bedroom.<eos> - What changed?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yes, I do.
"Down these mean streets a girl must go, who is not herself mean."<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> You all right?<eos> If I tell you something, you promise me you won't give me the look?<eos> What look?<eos> The Spencer look.<eos> The look that you give everyone when you're really disappointed in them.<eos> I didn't know I had an official look for that.<eos> Oh, you do.
I wish you'd stop saying that.<eos> Have you?<eos> 'Cause this car is just about out of gas.<eos> So am I.<eos> I'm just so damn tired.<eos> We're all tired, Spencer.<eos> Figure it out, so we can get on with our lives.<eos> No matter who gets hurt.<eos> You're all the time talking about wanting the answer.<eos> Maybe you do, maybe you don't.
I was afraid that you wouldn't forgive me.<eos> I met Alison in college.<eos> She lied about her age and I believed her.<eos> I don't want to hear this.<eos> I don't want to hear it.<eos> I just want to get off.<eos> Aria, please, just listen to me.<eos> Nothing you say will change anything.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.

You thought you got her pregnant.<eos> I never hurt Alison.<eos> I was writing a book about her.<eos> A true crime book.<eos> A book?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I saw in the papers that she had gone missing, I... I couldn't stop thinking about it.<eos> I had to get to the bottom of the story.<eos> Did you know who I was when we met?<eos> Yes, I did.
Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Anything for the dry cleaners?<eos> It was 3 days in rehab, Mom.<eos> I really did not need so many sweaters.<eos> I thought, I don't know, maybe you'd go outside for some fresh air or if you got cold.<eos> I did get cold and then I got the sweats.<eos> You know, withdrawal symptoms can't really be stopped with a cable knit.<eos> They said that the medical detox would help mitigate your discomfort.<eos> It did, mom.
Well, would it be any easier if I was at the foot of your bed?<eos> But Jason's not answering, Emily.<eos> He's unloading boxes from his car.<eos> I'm just gonna walk over there and try to talk to him.<eos> Talk to you later.<eos> You're up early.<eos> Yeah, I have to go talk to somebody before school.<eos> Okay, I'll grab my jacket.<eos> No, Dean, you don't have to come.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You don't embarrass me.<eos> I know I may never get to hear what happened with Ezra, but I do know that he broke your heart.<eos> And if I was to tell you that sometimes what seems like an ending turns out to be...<eos> Mom?<eos> I'm not... I'm not ready to hear this.<eos> When I met your father we were teenagers and I never expected to be with anyone else.<eos> Never.<eos> But then one day, things change, and it's over.<eos> And I'd be lying if I said it doesn't still hurt.<eos> It does.
Yes.<eos> - Stop, stop, stop.<eos> - Hey! Sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> What about your father?<eos> What about him?<eos> Is it true he was attracted to men?<eos> What?<eos> - No. Who says so?<eos> - John does.
I'll take you instead.<eos> No!<eos> Huzzah!<eos> Hip-hip, huzzah!<eos> Hip-hip, huzzah!<eos> We did it.<eos> ♪ I don't want to fall asleep ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause I miss you, babe ♪<eos> ♪ And I don't want to miss a thing ♪<eos> Oh, I don't.
- No, we just didn't think you spoke French.<eos> - Never judge a book by its cover.<eos> Listen, my boyfriend... he just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq... and he gets a bit twitchy when people are rude to me.<eos> Why not show him how much you liked his music.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Goodbye... and welcome to America!<eos> What just happened?<eos> They just really liked your music and didn't know how to express it.<eos> - You like movies? - I do.<eos> - You do?

I'm sorry for your trouble.<eos> Really, I don't know her.<eos> If you concentrate hard enough you can change the colors of the lights.<eos> That's not faith by the way, it's willpower.<eos> You would say God can change the colors.<eos> I'm saying we can.<eos> - Come on, try with me.<eos> - No.<eos> - Didn't God tell us to try everything once?<eos> - No, he didn't.
You just tell me what you wanna do for it, and then we'll come to a compromise.<eos> Merry secular Christmas to you.<eos> How did you do this?<eos> - Never you mind.<eos> - No, really.<eos> - How did this happen?<eos> - It's a Christmas miracle.<eos> Where did you get the money from, Hannah?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - Because it does.
was the getaway yacht.<eos> Everyone on board was dead.<eos> The burglars all died in a shootout. Our latest report is an earring was found on one body and the necklace found in the annex.<eos> These valuable items tend to prove there were no survivors and the Florentin is lost in the river.<eos> Simon Carrera planned the job, with Frank Scylla, ex-military, whose blood was found.<eos> Should I put your picture with theirs?<eos> They found these on the boat.<eos> You gave him a complete security breakdown and that's not important?<eos> Did I say it wasn't important?<eos> Did I? !
Look we haven't even got any sleeping bags and as for this bench come bed thing.<eos> Yeah, we don't need sleeping bags, we've got these blankets here to keep us warm you know, we can use our backpacks as pillows.<eos> Come on, it will be an adventure.<eos> Look, I know you're going through emotional roller coaster right now, OK?<eos> But if you don't let me, I can't help you.<eos> All right, I'm here for you, you know that, yeah?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look my heads just all over the place at the moment.<eos> I know how hard you're trying.<eos> I do.
Thanks, Harold.<eos> - Take care.<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> Why are they looking at my car?<eos> I called David.<eos> He's coming over with a lawyer.<eos> No-no-no-no.<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> - I have this under control.<eos> - What do you
I'm just trying to keep this family afloat.<eos> I'm not worth anything, if I can't do that.<eos> Sky Van Der Veen.<eos> - Phillip Kopus.<eos> - Yeah, I know who you are.<eos> Do you mind if I sit down? Wow. You're a lawyer.<eos> I thought lawyers were supposed to argue all the time.<eos> You were the quiet one-- you never said anything at all.<eos> You don't remember me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm sorry-- look at me.<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> - Say you love me.<eos> Junior.<eos> I love you, all right?<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> Why don't you answer my texts?<eos> Are you still hanging around with him?<eos> - That doesn't matter.<eos> - Yeah, it does.
- Say you love me.<eos> Junior.<eos> I love you, all right?<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> Why don't you answer my texts?<eos> Are you still hanging around with him?<eos> - That doesn't matter.<eos> - Yeah, it does.<eos> I know I acted like it didn't before,<eos> - but it does.
Guys?<eos> Note to self, not a ghost.<eos> How did people get anything done before computers?<eos> If I could just use a search function, this would take two seconds.<eos> We're wasting time, we should be looking somewhere else.<eos> Tara, it's okay.<eos> We're doing the best we can.<eos> Don't beat yourself up.<eos> We'll find something.<eos> What if we don't?
Don't really want it anymore.<eos> You sure?<eos> 'Cause it kind of seems like you still want it.<eos> Hey, Junebug, you want to get...<eos> "Junebug"?<eos> It's just a nickname.<eos> Yeah, I have one for you, too...<eos> Tessa... dactyl.<eos> I texted you after school to see if you wanted to get a yogurt, and you said you had plans?<eos> And I do, with Junebug.
Three sets of prints that aren't ours.<eos> You could have made the tracks yourself.<eos> You could have put the X on your head.<eos> - This could all be part of your little game.<eos> - It's not a game, Michael.<eos> They took our guns.<eos> The knives.<eos> They took my dog.<eos> - Maybe your dog just ran away.<eos> - He didn't, okay?
"Spicy!<eos> Spicy! Your looks are hot and spicy!" "Spicy!<eos> Spicy! Your charm is spicy."<eos> "You made my dreams fly in the sky."<eos> "You have this beauty to entertain you."<eos> "Come to me and take me with you."<eos> "Here he comes!"<eos> "He gets connected well to me."<eos> "Here he comes to show his charm."<eos> "He does wonders."
You are responsible for spoiling my love story.<eos> Anger won't do, sir.<eos> Request! Request?<eos> ! - Yes.<eos> Beg me!<eos> Sir! He is a donkey! A donkey!<eos> Donkey!<eos> A small request! - Oh! You should somehow break the match with IG's daughter.<eos> The pitch has to be higher!<eos> Brother! Please do me this favor.
But at some point, we have to accept the fact that life goes on.<eos> When was the last time you had something to eat?<eos> I had an aspirin for breakfast.<eos> Oh! It's a letter from Remi!<eos> That's great.<eos> We haven't heard from him in a long time.<eos> How is he?<eos> Does he say anything about Valentina?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> He doesn't.
I'm happy for what has happened to you.<eos> But when you're done telling me about your fancy new life, you go back to your room.<eos> You don't think to ask how my day was.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Is it?<eos> Alejandro can treat me like the help.<eos> I don't care.<eos> But you...<eos> I thought I mattered to you.<eos> Of course you do.
Most Atrians don't even have that information.<eos> If the Trags find out...<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> That's why I'm asking you.<eos> You're the only person I can trust that can help me.<eos> Maybe I used to have a reason to be on your side, but like you said this morning, it's over.<eos> Vega.<eos> The Trags have honored me by making me their leader.<eos> Do you know why you're here?<eos> I do.
They're taking them off.<eos> What?<eos> Why would they do something so reckless?<eos> Because we told them not to.<eos> Hello, beautiful.<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> It's ok.<eos> We've got nothing but time.<eos> Hey, how do we know this is the right way?<eos> We don't.
Ours was to be a transitional generation...<eos> Ensuring that 3 generations from now mankind could go home.<eos> But everything has changed, and we will either be the generation that sees the human race return to Earth...<eos> Or upon whose watch... It finally ends.<eos> My son is already down there.<eos> I sent him.<eos> And the truth is I don't know if he is alive or dead.<eos> But I still have hope.<eos> How does the Chancellor vote?<eos> I don't.
Why, you little...<eos> Why, you little...<eos> Why, you little...<eos> Why, you little...<eos> Dad, it's me.<eos> Prove it.<eos> When's your birthday?<eos> February 23rd.<eos> Ha! February has no 23rd. You...<eos> Yes, it does.
No, he doesn't.<eos> - He fishes.<eos> - You train...<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - He hunts, he sings... Like, dogs?<eos> He wakes up early to get papers and muffins.<eos> He watches foreign films with me and does all the voices.<eos> He explains the universe so that black holes sound cool, not scary.<eos> - You don't want to see me.<eos> - No, she does.

You're gonna go stay with Ray for a while?<eos> Just through the rehearsal process so I can just think about the play and not have to deal with all this drama.<eos> What drama?<eos> This is just me.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You didn't even care about the play.<eos> Well, but here's the thing.<eos> I did.<eos> I always did.

You only get 30 days from the birth of your baby to change your mind.<eos> What?<eos> I need to check something.<eos> The wrist tag from Annie's baby.<eos> I kept it in my locker.<eos> She has 30 days to change her mind, right?<eos> She still has two days left.<eos> Well, it's not just about the date.<eos> Does she have a job, a place to live, money in the bank to support the child?<eos> And what if she did?
Okay.<eos> Well you let me know if I can be of any help.<eos> Good night, Tricia.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We'll see.<eos> The idea is to take color theory and turn it on its head.<eos> Break all the rules.<eos> They're gorgeous.<eos> Who'd you say your client is?<eos> I didn't.
No, he doesn't like, um, crackers and he likes to have a small chips.<eos> I'm sorry, it's just, uh...<eos> My son, he's quite picky and he needs the meal number to be a prime number and there to be a prime number of prawn balls.<eos> And, um, if he had nine balls it wouldn't be a prime number and number 48 isn't...<eos> Isn't...<eos> Isn't a prime...<eos> Is it?<eos> Is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Definitely autistic.<eos> He seems to have picked up all the bad traits and none of the good.<eos> - What bad traits?<eos> - Obsessive.<eos> - Socially incompetent.<eos> - That sort of thing.<eos> It's about adaptability, Nathan.<eos> Sometimes we have to change our shape so that we fit in.<eos> That was you pushing the cage.<eos> - I did not!
Hello?<eos> It's me, Annie.<eos> Annie!<eos> Hi. How are you?<eos> OK... I think.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You said that my baby had red hair.<eos> Yes.<eos> I, uh... I didn't see her for very long, but...<eos> Yes, she did.
The third one will be whizzing around in orbit when it happens.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> As soon as all your hospital corners are done, I'll turn this on.<eos> You're confident of your corners?<eos> What difference will it make?<eos> Shouldn't you be upstairs?<eos> I should have lent you the money.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Probably wouldn't have had enough for a TV anyway.<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.

A dead man walking.<eos> What, you're gonna destroy him?<eos> Damn right.<eos> You kill an angel, its vessel dies, too.<eos> Think I don't know that?<eos> If I don't end Sam and that halo burns him out and I...<eos> God, I was so damn stupid.<eos> You were stupid for the right reasons.<eos> Yeah, like that matters.<eos> It does.
But? [ sighs ] I-I need to push the needle in deeper.<eos> We need more grace in order to cast the spell.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do it.<eos> Sam, if I get too close to --<eos> Damn it, cass!<eos> Your body is regressing to the state it was in before gadreel.<eos> Do we have enough grace for the summoning spell?<eos> Sam.<eos> Do we or not, cass?
I did a little digging.<eos> I found this in their glove compartment.<eos> They're Feds?<eos> Worse.<eos> They're hunters.<eos> Why are hunters here?<eos> Maybe because of this.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Do you think...<eos> I do.
Hurry up before I change my mind.<eos> I'll send you that postcard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, listen, that night that, uh... You know, we went our... our separate ways... You mean the night you split?<eos> Fair enough.<eos> I was messed up, man.<eos> Kevin was dead, and I... I don't know what I was.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hell, maybe I still don't.
Somebody who tried to kill Lizzie, who did kill Richards.<eos> Somebody is watching us.<eos> I can't do this again.<eos> Susan, it's not like that.<eos> No, I can't!<eos> Susan!<eos> Susan, hang on.<eos> I had to make myself ready to die fo them? I know.<eos> I know.<eos> No, you don't.
Susan, it's not like that.<eos> No, I can't!<eos> Susan!<eos> Susan, hang on.<eos> I had to make myself ready to die fo them? I know.<eos> I know.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You don't know.<eos> That's the problem, you don't know.<eos> None of you do.
Visitor.<eos> Who is it?<eos> You must be angry.<eos> I would be.<eos> We were very young.<eos> It felt like the only thing to do.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really am.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does, though.
Yes, the ambush vehicle.<eos> There's no forensics to connect it to the gunmen.<eos> Since we can't trace them via the vehicle, we've been concentrating on traffic cams, trying to plot the route that it took that night, but so far we've...<eos> Nothing.<eos> Right.<eos> You all right to hang around for a couple of secs, Les?<eos> Jo's got an idea she wants to go over with you.<eos> All right, sir.<eos> What idea?<eos> From now on, Les does the press conferences.
Did I?<eos> According to Denton, that's what you called her.<eos> I don't get where you're going with this.<eos> One theory would be that you were trying to conceal to your wife that you were receiving a call from DI Denton.<eos> And it'd be wrong.<eos> According to Denton's statement, when you worked together, your relationship went beyond the purely professional.<eos> First half-baked theories, now innuendo.<eos> You must want to face a suit for wrongful arrest.<eos> You deny an affair with Lindsay Denton?<eos> I do.
No more machine!<eos> No!<eos> I want to treat you.<eos> It has everything that you love.<eos> I can not eat before taking medications.<eos> Maybe I put it in another place?<eos> Maybe, in the bathroom?<eos> I'll call Noah to bring me.<eos> Noah?<eos> What does Noah?
George!<eos> Well, if you're here to see Sarah, you have a strange way of showing it.<eos> You didn't tell mother, did you?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I was quick enough on my feet to cover for you.<eos> Assuming it's Anna you're here for. Yes.<eos> I should have guessed with all the trips to the city.<eos> She's been talking to you about Gino.<eos> You know about him?<eos> I do now.
I'm guessing it was the same method used on old Randall.<eos> She's gone.<eos> You can stop pecking.<eos> Look, we need to find Hazel.<eos> Well, I've already alerted highway patrol and Amtrak and airport security.<eos> Hazel's trapped in the city.<eos> She's got nowhere to go.<eos> James Earl should be here instead of your charlatan ass.<eos> He is a gifted mind reader and a dear friend.<eos> Actually, Lassie, she does.
Me living through you.<eos> And I never felt envious of you, not one time.<eos> I was just grateful to have something to hope for, Even if it was for the life of another person.<eos> And you know, maybe especially because of that.<eos> And when I realized that, When I became conscious of that hope inside that 7x9 hellhole,<eos> I just thank God for it.<eos> Every day, Daniel.<eos> Every day.<eos> 'cause it gave me something to live for. You feel me?<eos> I do.
Hey, what are you doing?<eos> No!<eos> Who are they?<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> - English!<eos> - I was just telling my son that someone reported we had restricted technology.<eos> We don't have restricted tech, so you can just stop!<eos> They can threaten us all they want.<eos> We have nothing to hide.<eos> Actually, we do.
So...<eos> You just-- You put it out there.<eos> You got no qualms about telling strangers?<eos> This is what I do.<eos> If I was embarrassed about it, I wouldn't do it.<eos> TAJ: it's a hard fucking sell, Dom.<eos> Does anyone even know what Portuguese chicken is?<eos> - It's a Peri-Peri.<eos> -I know that.<eos> - Does anyone else?
So what about you?<eos> Are you into all this leather, whip, chain paraphernalia?<eos> - Men on hooks?<eos> -Not your thing?<eos> No, although I do kind of have--<eos> - See that guy over there?<eos> -Oh, my.<eos> I've got a soft spot for, you know, the old men who masturbate in the ass-less chaps.<eos> And I bet you've got a pair of ass-less chaps in the back of your wardrobe somewhere.<eos> Maybe I do and maybe...

Yeah. What?<eos> It was a great fucking place.<eos> Okay.<eos> It was just the wrong location.<eos> Yeah, you think?<eos> And he was kinda shit at keeping his books.<eos> You know?<eos> And when he got sick, I mean, I was 17.<eos> So I didn't know anything about running a restaurant.<eos> Well, you do now.
Can I tell you something?<eos> Of course.<eos> I was sort of thinking about it today, and I think it might be cool with me if you...<eos> You want me to fuck you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - But not today.<eos> Oh. I feel like maybe I opened up enough today.<eos> If you know what I mean.<eos> But I do.
You did not just say that.<eos> Can you at least hear me out, please?<eos> Yes, okay, I've been the worst fucking boyfriend to you, when all you've ever been is supportive.<eos> Are you listening, Frank?<eos> This thing that I did...<eos> This thing with paying CJ and not telling you...<eos> It was wrong on every level and I can-- Totally, I admit it now.<eos> Can you please come out here and talk to me?<eos> You don't want to hear what I've got to say.<eos> No, I do.
What am I looking at?<eos> - My W-2.<eos> - Box one is my last reported income at IBM. - Whoo-hoo.<eos> It's also what 200% of quota looks like.<eos> The golden circle.<eos> I'll break numbers.<eos> I always do.<eos> You answer to me. I'm SVP of sales, so you're dog shit around here until you close a deal.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - I do.

Because I want to build a machine that nobody else has the balls to build.<eos> Wow, you're serious.<eos> Look, that's a terrible idea.<eos> - For such a multitude of reasons that I... because it's illegal.<eos> Worst-case scenario, IBM sues us into the ground.<eos> Uh, Cardiff finds out, then both of us would be on the street.<eos> Apple, IBM, they have the market sewn up.<eos> Plus, you got Commodore, Tandy, Texas Instruments.<eos> I'm sorry, but you missed it.<eos> We all did.
- John?<eos> - Nope.<eos> I'm sorry, but I think you'll wanna take this.<eos> Mama makin' pork chops tonight.<eos> It's IBM.<eos> Bosworth here.<eos> John, it's Dale Butler, Senior Vice President of Sales, North America.<eos> What can I do you for, Dale?<eos> You got one of my boys down there.<eos> Why, yes, we do.
Where's your humanity?<eos> We're citizens of this country, mind.<eos> Citizens.<eos> No, I mean, they can't do that.<eos> It's totally illegal.<eos> A police officer has the right to stop you if, and that's the important word here, if he has reasonable grounds to believe a crime is going to be committed.<eos> Now, you're absolutely sure about this?<eos> Police harassment, dear.<eos> I could set it to music.<eos> And if he does?
"if hopes were dupes..."<eos> Oh, that's more like it.<eos> ♪ Maybe you want to give me kisses sweet<eos> ♪ but only for one night with no repeat ♪ and maybe you'll go away and never call... ♪<eos> I'm Gary.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hi.<eos> I want to learn to dance.<eos> We need to make something happen.<eos> Yeah, well, we do now, yeah.
"Throw your hands up and twist them around, do the Bhangra everybody"<eos> "Come on and do the Bhangra everybody!"<eos> "I like salsa, I like rumba, but if you wanna really party"<eos> "Throw your hands up and twist them around, do the Bhangra everybody"<eos> "Come on and do the Bhangra everybody!"<eos> "Nothing like my handsome lover,"<eos> "Nothing like my dreamboat savior,"<eos> "Nothing like some colorful bangles,"<eos> "And a fiery nosering."<eos> "Do the boogie woogie"
Any sign of him on surveillance?<eos> No, but their cameras only monitor 46% of the building.<eos> There's too many areas out of view.<eos> You and I need to split up. You take the --<eos> We're not splitting up.<eos> Look -- we have over 86,000 square feet to search.<eos> You really want do that -- room to room, holding my hand?<eos> The holding hands part is optional.<eos> - We don't have time to argue about it. - You're right.<eos> We don't.
That was a field call, not an order.<eos> Did Weatherly know?<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> You think I'm set up on you?<eos> Are you?<eos> No.<eos> But I'm clocking two of your pavement artists right now.<eos> You've had me in a floating box since I left Angel's Bluff.<eos> Weatherly didn't know.<eos> The president still doesn't.
Come on, go!<eos> Heads up. Limo's coming in hot!<eos> Damn. Where in the hell did you learn to drive?<eos> Urban combat driving school.<eos> High-threat escape scenarios.<eos> This is D.L. Tangent is safe and sound.<eos> - We are go for takeoff. - Roger that.<eos> I need it.<eos> You don't need it.<eos> I do!
Look who's putting the pressure on now.<eos> I think you can handle it.<eos> The morning after a big bash can be exciting... or surprising.<eos> What's the rush?<eos> Oh, I gotta go.<eos> If my girlfriend finds out, she'll totally dump me.<eos> You have a girlfriend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> I did not. Oh.
I'm glad you came.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> It's only been a week.<eos> I know, but, well... (Chuckles)<eos> I don't know about you, but it's been the longest week of my life.<eos> So, first things first.<eos> I got my results back yesterday.<eos> They're negative.<eos> I assume you got good news, too.<eos> Yeah, I did.
How do you know I'm here to bet on a horse?<eos> We're in front of the O.T.B.<eos> And a deli and a hair center for men.<eos> You told me you come up here and bet.<eos> I love the idea that betting relaxes you.<eos> It did until you showed up.<eos> Look, I've been thinking about you a lot.<eos> I was hoping to find you.<eos> I don't know where you live.<eos> Very few people do.
Scared.<eos> Excited.<eos> Vulnerable.<eos> - Well, you can't run away from that.<eos> - Sure, I can.<eos> I don't acknowledge it, then it'll just go away.<eos> So if I never tell my dad that I lost my job, and I'm moving to Malibu, that will go away?<eos> See?<eos> Running and hiding has its appeal.<eos> Mmm, yeah, it does.
- Stop!<eos> - Stay still!<eos> - Massimo, don't beat him!<eos> - What do you want to do to me?<eos> - If you stay still, we'll be done in a minute.<eos> - Let me do it.<eos> - You can't see well.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Done.
Me, a rooftop, gun, NYPD. Oh, wait a second.<eos> I'm sorry, I forgot you weren't there that day.<eos> - Too bad for your boy. - My boy?<eos> You went pretty far away to hide from him.<eos> Europe?<eos> I went to Europe because of you.<eos> In my line of work, there's a lot of worry about Detective Andrews,<eos> NYPD trafficking specialist.<eos> "Specialist" suggests an asshole like you is hard to find, or handle.<eos> I do okay.

- Yes.<eos> But you wanted to remind me that cops do good things.<eos> That won't make me not quit.<eos> I'm not trying to get you back to your old job.<eos> I understand perfectly why you quit.<eos> - You do? - Yes.<eos> The hardest moment in every cop's life, it's when they realize how scary it is to be the police.<eos> Scary?<eos> You think it's about fear?<eos> Yes, I do.
In afghanistan, I led over 100 raids on insurgent camps.<eos> If anyone can make you real soldiers, it's me.<eos> Now, to start with, this unit doesn't even have a motto.<eos> A motto embodies the spirit of the unit! Shh.<eos> Ooh, how about, "give me back Those cds you borrowed, brian."<eos> That's not a motto.<eos> But it does need to be said.<eos> Let's talk about your appearance.<eos> Now, we've got a weight issue In this general area here.<eos> We do. Yeah, we do!
Who cares if we're the ones that nobody else wants?<eos> We don't need them.<eos> We have each other now.<eos> We're here together.<eos> We'll train together, we'll fight together.<eos> And we'll take care of each other.<eos> We're all we've got.<eos> We're brothers.<eos> I wish we had a motto to shout.<eos> We do.
What are you doing here?<eos> I told you, I love being a soldier.<eos> Plus it's always fun seeing wallace freak out.<eos> I am so texting the general.<eos> All right, let's do this. Let's do this.<eos> Take the wall, chubowski! ♪ thunder ♪ ?<eos> Darn it.<eos> I want my money back. It was...<eos> We had a whole, really cool boyz n the hood thing.<eos> No, we did not...
No great discomfort.<eos> Subcutaneous fat closes over the wound, so not much bleeding.<eos> Not much to see.<eos> Oh, and you got your murder weapon yet?<eos> Nope.<eos> OK.<eos> Well, the wound has a little kink in it.<eos> In the flesh.<eos> Meaning?<eos> So did the blade.
Anyway, who'd want to run your life?<eos> Need their head looking at.<eos> Oh. Lady up at Holypool?<eos> Jane. Mm.<eos> Aye.<eos> Her and... that...<eos> Who?<eos> Margaret?<eos> Didn't we think much of her?<eos> No, we didn't.
You spinning me that lie about Margaret's violent husband.<eos> No, Margaret came to the police station to tell us about Ryan.<eos> And she wasn't alone, was she?<eos> "Can we sit down, sort out our options?"<eos> Emily.<eos> Margaret said that my son... ..raped that child.<eos> Yeah, and you didn't believe her?<eos> Of course I didn't believe her.<eos> Do you want to know the truth about Margaret?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Yeah, you should.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm so sorry!<eos> I wasn't gonna tell you.<eos> I knew it would only hurt you.<eos> Being lied to feels great.<eos> I screwed up, okay?<eos> But it was during a turn.<eos> I didn't want it to happen!<eos> - On some level, you did.
You know, when this is done, you get to have your life back.<eos> You can do whatever you want!<eos> I don't... I don't know what I want anymore.<eos> I... I... I screwed everything up!<eos> It's all I ever do.<eos> No, you can fix this!<eos> This is your chance!<eos> You can change things!<eos> - You really think that?<eos> - Yes! I really do.
I'm really over the whole moping around bit.<eos> My life right now is so much better than it used to be, and I'm really not blaming anyone for little hiccups.<eos> Oh God!<eos> Changing into a wolf is not a little hiccup.<eos> Honestly though, I've seen you change, and every month, you hum and haw and hiss and pooh-pooh on it, and it really doesn't seem that bad. I'm just gonna say it.<eos> - Sally, I'm sorry.<eos> - Stop apologizing.<eos> Let me finish.<eos> You don't know what this curse is yet.<eos> You don't.
Well, are you gonna show us where Josh is?<eos> Ok, yes!<eos> Hello?<eos> Can we at least pretend we run a fake business?<eos> You don't wanna do this.<eos> Oh, I heard that you can compel vampires.<eos> That even gave me a little tingle.<eos> Looks like the juniper's working.<eos> - You want to let me go.<eos> - No, I really don't.
Oh, yes, I remember that painting.<eos> And that is the man I sold it to.<eos> And that man sold it to me!<eos> That proves the painting is mine!<eos> And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!<eos> I love art!<eos> Art?<eos> What do you know about art?<eos> You don't even know who painted that picture.<eos> Yes, I do.
Wow.<eos> Get off me, man.<eos> Dude, what part of no didn't you understand?<eos> Fucking tease.<eos> You all right?<eos> Let's get you home, all right?<eos> Guess you've gotten quite an education tonight, huh, choir boy?<eos> I guess so.<eos> You probably don't even go to church, do you?<eos> In this burg, we all do.
Struggling?<eos> With these unnatural desires.<eos> I don't know, sir.<eos> All my life.<eos> As long as I can remember.<eos> I thought I could ignore it, bury it.<eos> But I get these dreams.<eos> Dreams.<eos> Do you want to be normal, Randolph?<eos> Yes, yes I do.
A messenger has brought news.<eos> Famine spreads through your city of Cesena.<eos> Those noble folk.<eos> I will alleviate their suffering.<eos> But first I must deal with Vitelli's occupation of Arezzo.<eos> Bring the French and Gascon troops there to rejoin the rest of my army.<eos> Florence is safe, for now.<eos> I have Louis' blessing to take Bologna.<eos> - The French know nothing of politics.<eos> - Does Florence?
In Stresa, when I invited her into my room,<eos> I could tell right away she'd never cheat on her husband.<eos> You're a keen observer of women.<eos> How long have you been together?<eos> We were married 19 years ago.<eos> Before I existed!<eos> That's right.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> But you did?
Whatever was behind her... Was really there.<eos> Okay, well, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> I mean, how could something be both real and fake at the same time?<eos> Well, a girl is dead, and that's about as real as it gets.<eos> All right, so, the last thing she did was she took a photo on her phone.<eos> How did that photo end up online?<eos> No clue.<eos> It was originally posted to a Thinman fan forum, but the I.P. address was blocked.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. This thing has fans?<eos> Of course it does.
They leave voicemails for him.<eos> Saying?<eos> Mostly, they're rude.<eos> One mentioned something called the First Blade.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Follow how this develops and report in.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> And when I do, I expect to report directly to the next Queen of Hell.<eos> Capiche?<eos> All right, do it.
I've given my word!<eos> Gavin, listen to your father.<eos> I know what's best for you.<eos> Kids.<eos> Squirrel.<eos> I hope you were nice to your father.<eos> What?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Look, we got the Blade.<eos> You do?
Well, I don't know what to tell you.<eos> Them's the rules.<eos> He goes back.<eos> The lore all says the same thing ... you change any one thing in the past, the ripple effect impacts everything that follows.<eos> Please.<eos> No one bends the rules like you two bend the rules.<eos> He's one misfit kid.<eos> He impacts no one.<eos> You don't bend that rule, okay?<eos> You don't.
One, Julian doesn't want to stop this, and second, how?<eos> You're a runaway and I'm...<eos> I'm a bitch.<eos> We don't matter.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Since when do you play their game?<eos> And since when do you let your dad sell you to some dick from New York?<eos> You think I had a choice?<eos> !<eos> You did!
Why?<eos> Because he is a weird guy, okay?<eos> He's a weird, dorky, little guy.<eos> But he happens to have an army of Angels behind him, and, even though I hate to say it, if we're gonna take a shot at Metatron, they might be useful.<eos> Well, do you think we need the First Blade?<eos> Why don't we just leave that here?<eos> We talked about this, and we decided that --<eos> No.<eos> In all fairness, we didn't decide.<eos> You did.
Roll it back.<eos> There.<eos> That was an angel -- Esther.<eos> She's one of Metatron's.<eos> So, this was some kind of hit?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Stop saying you don't know.<eos> You can't think I would allow something like this.<eos> Cass, I know you try to be a good guy, okay?<eos> I do.
Order.<eos> If I let you take matters into your own hands, what's to stop one of them from doing the same?<eos> You can talk to her.<eos> You should talk to her.<eos> But leave the Blade outside.<eos> Are you asking or telling?<eos> We're not asking.<eos> You sure you don't want to go back, Cass?<eos> Look, if Dean is right about Tessa...<eos> No, I, uh... I do.
So I suffered... Until death, nothingness.<eos> Suddenly, it didn't seem so bad.<eos> It seemed quiet.<eos> So, why don't you just jam an angel blade in your throat and call it a day?<eos> I thought about it...<eos> But I was too weak...<eos> Till Castiel gave me a reason to die.<eos> Yeah.<eos> See, that just doesn't sound like the Cass I know.<eos> But doesn't it, though?
Is it a shell?<eos> - Open it.<eos> - Help me.<eos> This isn't zirconia. It's real diamonds.<eos> Really?<eos> Like yours?<eos> Do we have the same now?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you like them?<eos> - Of course I do.
100, 200, 300 kilos.<eos> We'll take everything they have.<eos> But you have to make the price.<eos> You must be crafty.<eos> Start with 1.20 and not more than 1.40.<eos> - I get it.<eos> A maximum of 1.40.<eos> - Good. We sell it to the dealers for 30 and they sell it on for 50 Then we'll have control of it all.<eos> There will be no one else left.<eos> Don't do anything else.
If you're good, you'll memorize them.<eos> My name is Stephanie Daldry.<eos> I am a professional model.<eos> "Freddy Hayes was convicted in 1982 for sticking up a convenience store in Columbia Heights.<eos> During a high-speed pursuit, Hayes lost control and crashed into another vehicle, killing an elderly couple.<eos> He avoided manslaughter charges by pleading guilty to armed robbery.<eos> He served nine years.<eos> In 1992, he opened Freddy's BBQ Joint, a small restaurant specializing in ribs, frequented by Vice President Frank Underwood."<eos> - Did you know?<eos> - No, I didn't.
I'm your lobbyist, not your henchman.<eos> I don't employ lobbyists.<eos> I employ people who can be useful to me.<eos> And you are proving otherwise.<eos> Quiet now.<eos> - I'll figure something out.<eos> - Soon.<eos> OK, that's good.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Is that the Acropolis?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Do you still have this rabbit?<eos> - Yes why?<eos> - You're 16, dammit! - In two months.<eos> And you almost 18.<eos> - Unfortunately.<eos> - Why?<eos> Jenny had since two years no residence permit.<eos> We don't also, now.
Anyway, I-I didn't understand it.<eos> I didn't take it seriously enough.<eos> Your mother was a good woman, Maggie.<eos> If she did anything wrong, it was my fault.<eos> I should have been more understanding.<eos> Okay?<eos> I...<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Did you know that Agent Bellamy has gone over my head and gotten a federal court order to open the tomb?<eos> I did.
The...<eos> The school is in the saloon?<eos> It's the only place big enough To hold our children, miss thatcher.<eos> We had requested<eos> A mature, experienced teacher,<eos> Someone who would not shrink from the challenges That coal valley presents.<eos> I realize I'm perhaps not what you expected,<eos> But I assure you I am acquainted With the most modern teaching theories,<eos> The superintendent of schools did tell you What happened here?<eos> No, he didn't.
These wrench marks on it.<eos> I'm gonna go back to the car, get a wrench.<eos> Yeah, or you could do it.<eos> I can't see anything.<eos> Let's go.<eos> These guys have all day, but we don't.<eos> Commander Bisgaard is on the scene.<eos> First rule of officer safety:<eos> if you can't protect yourself, you can't protect anyone.<eos> - Don't ever do this again.
You're welcome.<eos> That's great. What about you, darling?<eos> What are you looking for in a man?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Whatever you think is best.<eos> Well, what's best is whatever your heart desires.<eos> So what does it desire?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Um... Dalia had a good answer.<eos> - She did.
I doubt it.<eos> That's a bit weird then.<eos> Oh, you're such a dirty old man!<eos> You're a child.<eos> Not built like that, I'm not.<eos> Kev, darling?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Here. Give us a hand.<eos> I need a smoke.<eos> - No, you don't.

Aren't you?<eos> There must be someone you'd like to see with a rope around his neck after what happened at Churchill.<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, I'm...<eos> Sometimes.<eos> There were these kids. During the fire, they beat me up.<eos> They can't find them.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because no one will say, they saw them.<eos> But you did.
Although the couple issued a statement Saying the divorce will be amicable, Rumors are swirling that the hunky soap star<eos> May have cheated on america's sweetheart. And, of course, we'll always keep you updated For the latest on this story.<eos> Rosie, what are you doing here?<eos> I saw the tv.<eos> They were talking about you and mrs. Peri.<eos> Look, I can't talk right now.<eos> I just wanted to see if you were okay.<eos> Not really.<eos> Do you want to go to breakfast tomorrow, Tell me what happened?<eos> No, I don't.
I'm keeping an eye on him.<eos> No, you should have come to me and asked for my permission.<eos> But instead, you gave a deadly weapon to a man...<eos> Now what are you doing? I'm sweaty.<eos> I need to dry off.<eos> [Sighs] You were saying?<eos> No, ah... [sighs]<eos> I was saying you gave a deadly weapon to someone whose mental state... [Breathes deeply]<eos> Don't you know it's... offensive to disrobe in front of a lady?<eos> I do.
[Inhales deeply] Okay.<eos> You are forgiven.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> I want us to be friends.<eos> Maybe we can see a movie sometime.<eos> [Exhales sharply] Before we pencil anything in, let me get your coat.<eos> I really do appreciate your apology.<eos> The truth is I was also a little bit out of line.<eos> Well, at least you have an excuse for your behavior.<eos> I don't. Huh?
- Oh. - I'm not sweating it, though.<eos> You know, it'll all work out the way it's meant to.<eos> I think you're absolutely right.<eos> So, which purse do you like?<eos> Uh... that one.<eos> Wrong.<eos> This one is better.<eos> Now... pick a bracelet.<eos> I like this silver.<eos> Unless I-I don't.
I was just... curious.<eos> So was the cat.<eos> We all know what happened to him.<eos> You'll never guess what happened.<eos> Go on.<eos> Guess.<eos> No, forget it.<eos> I'll just tell you.<eos> I got into Brown.<eos> You did? !
I need another jar of moisturizer.<eos> Uh, this should cover it.<eos> $300?<eos> Why so expensive?<eos> The main ingredient is nightingale droppings.<eos> And you pay extra for that?<eos> It is worth it.<eos> It helps my skin look 10 years younger.<eos> So why don't you use it on your hands?<eos> I do.
Carmen and I are not romantically involved.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> That's because you're confused.<eos> Hey, your mom and I are gonna make sure that you get the help that you need.<eos> I want to talk to Carmen.<eos> She refuses to step into this house until you're gone.<eos> That's how much you've upset her.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Carmen loves me.<eos> No, she doesn't.
His usual racket is to target wealthy, middle-aged married women.<eos> He lures them into an affair, and then blackmails them by threatening to tell their husbands.<eos> Evelyn will be devastated when she finds out.<eos> I can't wait to tell her.<eos> Thanks again, Rick.<eos> Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.<eos> Wait.<eos> I already know they're involved.<eos> Tony knows I know.<eos> - He does?
I'm Pablo.<eos> Zoila's Pablo.<eos> Her ex-husband?<eos> Her current husband, but thanks for asking.<eos> Is she here?<eos> She's making breakfast.<eos> That smells good.<eos> If you invite him to eat with us, I'll kill you.<eos> - We have to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.
Carmen, give me those.<eos> Let me drive you.<eos> - No, I'll drive myself.<eos> - Not until you're sober.<eos> Give me those keys!<eos> This is for your own good!<eos> Open this door!<eos> I want those keys!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> ! Do you? !
What kind of trouble?<eos> Ethan, before you go, I need to ask you something.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> Why...<eos> Why did Nicholas let your mother live here all these years?<eos> Did she have something on him?<eos> I'm not sure what it was, but yeah.<eos> She had something.<eos> Of course, mom couldn't really tell anyone because Nick saw her push Dahlia off the bridge.<eos> We both did.
Don't follow until you hear the all-clear.<eos> What's that?<eos> Stun baton.<eos> Use them on polar bears.<eos> Non-lethal, pack a wallop.<eos> Ought to come in handy if we run into any bears.<eos> We run into Peter, you'll be glad we have these.<eos> He tore off a man's head. A shock will stop him?<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, I do.
No, you drank it all, Dad.<eos> There's none in the bag. That's what I'm saying.<eos> Well, I will...<eos> I will run to the store... and get some more when I'm finished with my paper.<eos> Hey, Dad?<eos> How about we go see a movie or something later?<eos> I'd love to, Katie... but I think I have to meet Milt and Frank later.<eos> Sorry, kiddo.<eos> Hi, Mr. Campbell.<eos> How you doing this afternoon?
So why did we dig this pit, dammit? - For you.<eos> That pit is for you, Rico.<eos> Not at first, but now it is.<eos> We haven't been screwed over.<eos> I've been screwed over.<eos> By you.<eos> Me?<eos> What's wrong all of a sudden?<eos> You said you loved me.<eos> - I do, 200 percent.
Another for Lissa.<eos> Good choice, Trina.<eos> Wow, this is a tight race.<eos> In fact, it's dead even.<eos> Lissa doesn't even want to be cheer captain.<eos> Well, if I'm called to serve,<eos> I guess I'd have no choice.<eos> Jenna, the equipment girl, may I have your ballot, please?<eos> - I get a vote?<eos> - No, you don't.
There's nothing like one of your reproachful stares to make a person toe the line.<eos> He's scared I'll hit him with my stick.<eos> Right, Jacob... ..are you ready for a spot of crowd control after lunch?<eos> What is this?<eos> It's called Quiche Lorraine, according to Mrs B.<eos> Pass me the beetroot.<eos> With Sister Julienne's permission, I'll make myself a sandwich.<eos> Of course.<eos> What I want to know is does Nurse Lee say when she's coming back?<eos> No, she doesn't.
Shelagh, leave him to his own devices.<eos> We both left him to his own devices, if you remember, the day he was taken ill!<eos> I don't deserve that and neither do you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> We're both sorry.<eos> And he's an 11-year-old boy.<eos> Polio or no polio, he needs to spread his wings.<eos> I don't know what I'm going to do with myself.<eos> I do.
Patsy was up and out first thing and nobody's heard from her since.<eos> It means that Chummy's single-handed again on the district rota and having to cover for her.<eos> She was in a prison camp.<eos> And at nine-years-old.<eos> It must have been unimaginably awful.<eos> We had a bit of a set-to.<eos> She seemed to think none of us really understood her.<eos> And now nobody knows where she's gone.<eos> Do you fear that she might have left Nonnatus House altogether?<eos> I did.
Well, Max, I'm Carmen Herrara from the Lower East Side Action Committee.<eos> OK.<eos> Basically, we're dedicated to the preservation and rejuvenation of the Lower East Side.<eos> We're trying to stop real estate developers from converting the neighborhood into luxury housing and retail spaces, forcing the regular people out.<eos> - How are they forcing them out?<eos> - Money.<eos> I mean, they buy them out or they raise the rent.<eos> How much do you think I'd get for a place like this?<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> It does to me.
- Yeah, we live together.<eos> No, it definitely wasn't your girlfriend.<eos> - Well, how do you know that?<eos> - Because it was a guy.<eos> Wha...?<eos> A guy?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> It's OK. I don't care.<eos> I think it's hot.<eos> You... You do?
- No, but I wish I was.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Oh, sure, OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I screamed at you before.<eos> It's just...<eos> I get scared.<eos> And I need to know you want me here.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I do. I definitely do.
Oh, um, we need more names for our petition.<eos> Do you think you could get your dad to sign?<eos> - Nah.<eos> - Max, this is important.<eos> I know.<eos> My, uh, father took off a while ago.<eos> He ain't around anymore.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - It hurts.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Everyone's gone.<eos> - Hello, Carmen.<eos> - Hi, Mr. Solomon.<eos> This is my friend, Max and we need to talk to you about something.<eos> Oh, come.<eos> How are you?<eos> These men, they said they want to kill me?<eos> They said they would burn your building down with you in it, so, yeah.<eos> You believe him?<eos> Yeah, I do.
how can you even suggest...<eos> I'm not suggesting anything.<eos> She... she was depressed.<eos> She killed herself.<eos> - If she's capable of that, she...<eos> - No.<eos> Absolutely not. No.<eos> Janine, you have to know I didn't want this.<eos> You wanted a baby.<eos> We both did.
Like E.T.<eos> Yeah, sure. Why not?<eos> Puts the bike on the roof of the garage and just launches himself.<eos> I bet you, uh, you didn't fly, did you?<eos> No. Three stitches.<eos> - Five, mom.<eos> - Five? Hmm.<eos> Oh, yeah, he's right.<eos> Five. Do you still have the scar?<eos> You do?
But you didn't.<eos> But not because I'm Mary bloody Magdalen.<eos> It's because I love you.<eos> I told you, he went for a drink with Asbo.<eos> Don't. Mal, please don't.<eos> Mal, Rob, grab the working at height gear. Who else?<eos> I'll go up, gaffer.<eos> Spike.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> How we doing in there?
Come on.<eos> Oi!<eos> Eh? What do you fucking think?<eos> Yeah!<eos> I got him!<eos> Piss off! Get off him!<eos> Just get off him!<eos> You all right, babe?<eos> You want some?<eos> Do you?
Oh, fuck.<eos> Fuck!<eos> After it happened, my family wouldn't speak to me and I was so...<eos> I was so lonely for a really long time.<eos> And then I met you.<eos> And I just sort of realised that a person's not like a fixed thing.<eos> A person's just the stuff other people know about them.<eos> And you only knew the good stuff.<eos> But you know everything about me.<eos> I do...
Oh, my God!<eos> An engineer could use a boiler room to blow up the whole school.<eos> We have to get them out of there.<eos> We have to get everyone out.<eos> How do we do that? (FIRE ALARM RINGING) Wow.<eos> Pulling a fire alarm on Mischief Night is one thing. Doing it when there's a mass murderer spotted nearby is insane!<eos> If I was four years younger, I'd punch you.<eos> What?<eos> Coach, that doesn't make sense.<eos> Oh, well, it does to me!
The existence of magic is definitely a game changer.<eos> No way.<eos> I'm not giving up.<eos> - Come on, Sam.<eos> Maybe Felix is right.<eos> - You go, then.<eos> I'm staying.<eos> - That's even more pointless.<eos> - Do you guys even want to go home?<eos> - Sam, we all do.
There is no deal with me and Drake.<eos> I just saw you two talking.<eos> And you left the bug together on Saturday.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> Okay, he asked me to give him a ride to Edendale, and I felt bad for him, so...<eos> Look, if you don't want me to hang out with him, I won't.<eos> I know that you really like him.<eos> A momentary lapse in judgment I can only attribute to a hormonal shift and/or... sheer boredom.<eos> But if you wanted to get with Drake, then...<eos> I don't.
- You.<eos> And your parents.<eos> I'm not sure I follow.<eos> I think you do.<eos> - Get out of my house, Roman.<eos> - You know, it's funny.<eos> I seem to remember you being in my pod without permission.<eos> Was that part of some Red Hawk plan to bug the place?<eos> I think we both know what this is really about.<eos> We do.
What is all this about?<eos> The aqueduct.<eos> People are furious that the Romans used the Temple funds to build it.<eos> Hundreds are heading to complain to Pilate.<eos> What?<eos> He'll have them cut down before they can get anywhere near him.<eos> Thieves!<eos> Jerusalem needs water.<eos> You think your God brings it?<eos> No, He does not.

Joe: Daddy, Kate's innocent.<eos> The KGB set her up.<eos> They've obviously been on to us ever since Mallory went off the rails.<eos> Daddy: Say that's true.<eos> Say they knew Arkady was compromised.<eos> They wanted to send us on a wild goose chase.<eos> Why sacrifice such hugely valuable intel to do it?<eos> Sarah: I agree.<eos> They had the resources to sabotage Lakenheath, to devastate us.<eos> No, they didn't.
(STUTTERING) What?<eos> No! This isn't about... No, no...<eos> No, this is not something like that.<eos> I just thought it would be pleasant.<eos> No, no, it would, but it's awkward.<eos> Work.<eos> This would cost you nothing. But for me...<eos> You can't court your boss and expect people to respect you.<eos> So, we have to choose.<eos> Well, at least I do.
Is that it?<eos> We've met.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Not the sort of face you forget.<eos> This enough?<eos> It's just a car you wanted to do, isn't it?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Christ, be careful with it!<eos> Where did you say you were from?<eos> I didn't.
The year that we were apart, where were you?<eos> - I've told you.<eos> - I know.<eos> I just need you to tell me again.<eos> In hospital.<eos> Then a prison camp.<eos> Then I was moved around a lot.<eos> Joe, I've spent the last year being pushed down corridors with a gun at my head.<eos> But at the end, they said I would have you.<eos> And now I do.
Were you involved in Alfonso di Calabria's death, in any way?<eos> My love, no.<eos> After the feelings you and I have shared, the truths of our inner selves, how can such an accusal come to your mind?<eos> I do not kill.<eos> Yes, Alfonso and I were at odds, but...<eos> Well, he wanted me dead. He even tried once.<eos> But I did not kill him, Lucrezia.<eos> And I am wounded that you would even ask.<eos> You do believe me, do you not?<eos> I do.
Then I will be even more honest.<eos> Cesare, I have long believed that you murdered Alfonso di Calabria.<eos> Whether I did or did not, you have forgiven me.<eos> Yes.<eos> But now I fear that I had no reason to forgive you.<eos> That someone else committed the crime.<eos> The man whom tomorrow I will marry.<eos> Lucrezia, I swear, I am the guilty one.<eos> Swear upon the love you and I share.<eos> I do.
But now you have a lot of work to do, so I need you to begin.<eos> Start here.<eos> My husband called two days ago, said that he'd taken our daughter Tory, and not to tell anyone or it would be bad for her.<eos> I guess I never knew him.<eos> Is that the man my husband shot?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Just what the hell do you think you're doing here, Secret Service?<eos> This is where the FBI works.<eos> Agent Finley, I thought I made it clear you are not working this.<eos> Yes, Agent Dunn, you did.
That man I killed-- you ID the body?<eos> Nope.<eos> No match on prints, dental or DNA.<eos> The guy was a ghost.<eos> Felt like Special Forces, though-- guy was tough.<eos> But you were tougher.<eos> Yes, ma'am, in that moment, I was.<eos> Tough and useful, and yet 26 kids go missing on your watch.<eos> You still think I'm in on it.<eos> No, I don't.
(Both laugh) That's a good one, Dr. Gunderson.<eos> Tell him your put-down, Abe.<eos> Tell him your put-down.<eos> Well, I was just telling Ed here that your game reminds me of a case of trichomoniasis in an otherwise healthy vagina.<eos> (Both laugh) - I had to agree!<eos> - It's true!<eos> You guys are both hilarious and a pleasure to park near.<eos> Seriously? (Annika moaning) Ah!<eos> You're so hot. Mmm, so are you. You want to get dirty?<eos> Yes, I do.
I know this sucks.<eos> I mean, you gave her her first piano.<eos> Given what happened last week... that freaked Reagan out.<eos> Look, Reagan just isn't ready to lift the ban on you and Esme seeing each other.<eos> No, I, uh... I totally understand.<eos> I do.<eos> So, just give Esme a hug for me, will you?<eos> And tell her, um...<eos> Well, you know what to say.<eos> I do.
You know, I can't stop thinking about last time.<eos> It will never happen again.<eos> You can't call her when you're manic or depressed.<eos> You're supposed to be the grown-up.<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> You have somewhere else to turn for love and support.<eos> If we love each other, we can deal with the truth.<eos> I slept with someone in San Francisco. Oh.<eos> I don't deserve this.<eos> You don't.
Previously on "Black Box"...<eos> I'd like to propose a-a toast to the brilliant woman who I'm now going to be spending the rest of my life with.<eos> What happened between us...<eos> It was meaningless sex.<eos> Why do you want me to touch you again?<eos> - I don't.

Oh, stop. You're... you're too kind.<eos> I'm the lucky one.<eos> He's a...<eos> He's a catch.<eos> - Yes.<eos> He is.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, I do hope you are as crazy about him as he is about you.<eos> My son deserves a wife who thinks he is the sun, the moon, and the stars.<eos> Yes, he does.
You know that?<eos> I gave your mother this necklace the morning you were born.<eos> The hearts are you and me and Joshua... strung on the same chain of gold.<eos> And whether or not you ever speak to me again... That chain will never be broken.<eos> Kitty, you look... you just...<eos> You're so much like your mother.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm nothing like her.<eos> Why do you give your father so much power over you?<eos> I don't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I was, uh...<eos> I was distracted.<eos> My... my patient was in critical condition.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Couldn't have taken one night off?<eos> No, I'm a doctor.<eos> Of course... you know that.<eos> I can't take a night off.<eos> My parents don't.
You left a note.<eos> "No obligations. No strings."<eos> - Yeah, your motto.<eos> - Your words.<eos> I take them at face value, which I assume is what you want.<eos> Well, it's what you want, isn't it?<eos> I'm open.<eos> You want to talk about this?<eos> Sure.<eos> If you do.
You don't want to hurt them.<eos> You don't want to hurt them.<eos> You're a good person.<eos> You're a good person.<eos> Kill yourself.<eos> Kill yourself.<eos> If you can't stop, you must kill yourself.<eos> Kill yourself.<eos> If you can't stop, you have to kill yourself.<eos> Do it. Just do it.
Yes, Captain.<eos> Jim, will you give us a minute?<eos> Captain.<eos> The answer's no.<eos> Yes!<eos> What do I have to do, change his diapers?<eos> You got to be kidding!<eos> I don't care!<eos> She said you had to keep me, huh?<eos> Yeah, she did.
- You owe me.<eos> So... talk to me.<eos> We're getting nowhere on the Wayne case.<eos> I made a promise to Bruce Wayne and I can't deliver.<eos> But you will.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe I'm out of my depth.<eos> Hey.<eos> I very much doubt you're out of your depth, but even if you are, you know how to swim, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
I remember that last time.<eos> - We were there.<eos> - He was the life of the party.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Right you are.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Move over.<eos> Come on, I don't have enough space.<eos> - Yes, you do.
She's engaged.<eos> It hasn't been announced.<eos> It will be.<eos> I'll throw in the towel if you prefer.<eos> It's not up to me.<eos> I simply don't see the possibility of your success.<eos> We shall see, sir.<eos> Yes.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
It's temporary.<eos> I hope so. ♪ I know a gal A wonderful gal ♪ She's the sweetest gal in town<eos> ♪ You're the one I need... ♪ I was starting to think you'd lost your nerve.<eos> ♪ A red-hot momma, a red-hot momma ♪ Yes, indeed... ♪ Hope I didn't interrupt anything.<eos> Harold?<eos> Oh, I'm not his type at all.<eos> Oh. Not like that.<eos> He likes the dusky ladies.<eos> Right.<eos> They, on the other hand, do like men, dusky or otherwise.
Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> - How is he?<eos> - Well, I don't know.<eos> They, took him to the hospital for an MRI and some other tests.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I can call you if there's news.<eos> That's if you want to know.<eos> I do.
I want to know what happened at the Quintana House.<eos> It was a freak thing.<eos> She had a stroke.<eos> The money wasn't supposed to be there.<eos> Well, um, like I told you, we had a delay.<eos> We understood you, would be able to handle the volume.<eos> And we can.<eos> Then why didn't you?<eos> That will not happen again.<eos> But it did.
Foreplay?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Is this weird?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe you should go.<eos> I can't.<eos> She's your mother.<eos> I mean, what if this guy saw her?<eos> No, he didn't.
You have anything else you want to know?<eos> Yeah, what do you got going on up at that ranch?<eos> The lord's work.<eos> A safe haven<eos> The path.<eos> For the moment...<eos> I'm gonna let her go with you, all right?<eos> But you're responsible for her.<eos> If anything happens to her, you answer to me, do you understand?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Take the plea.<eos> Be good.<eos> Get out early.<eos> Everybody's fucked me.<eos> If I was trying to fuck you, I wouldn't be here.<eos> He's gonna get away with it, isn't he?<eos> Yes.<eos> He is.<eos> - Take an iced tea if you have any.<eos> - We don't.
That's a terrible idea.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> And given where we are, Frank, I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.<eos> Well, I wasn't suggesting it as something you should do. Just as a possibility.<eos> No, in fact, I don't think you should.<eos> I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.<eos> Let the public fatigue on it.<eos> And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?<eos> - It'll lose steam.<eos> - What if it doesn't?
Can I ask you a question, miss thatcher?<eos> Of course.<eos> The new miners...<eos> What do you think of them?<eos> I think they can be loud,<eos> And sometimes they interrupt our class, But they're here to reopen the mine,<eos> And I think that's a good thing, Because it means It will bring prosperity back to coal valley.<eos> I don't like them.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I just don't.
Richard.<eos> Hi, Monica.<eos> I work with Peter Gregory.<eos> - We met outside the TED...<eos> - Yeah, I remember you.<eos> What... how'd you know I was here?<eos> Peter Gregory is invested in a company that uses GPS in phones to track people.<eos> That's creepy.<eos> You don't know the half of it.<eos> And neither does congress.
If he wants it, be my guest.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're a peach.<eos> No!<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I love Zoe.<eos> You think you can just throw me away for some junior varsity mall rat?<eos> I made you, Kyle, not her.<eos> You owe me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
A world that makes promises it cannot keep.<eos> To tell a colored man that he can be equal to a white man?<eos> There's the real cruelty.<eos> I'm not going anywhere. Actually you are.<eos> Ow! Straight to hell.<eos> It's impossible!<eos> I'm immortal.<eos> Wrong.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Tough shit. Who does?
Let's be realistic.<eos> When the new Supreme is dead, I'll have 30 years of vitality until another one comes along.<eos> And the doors of every palace are going to open for me.<eos> I mean, hell, I know you've got all this to offer, but come on, you and I both knew that this would never...<eos> Ah! Son of a...<eos> Let go of me!<eos> I love you!<eos> Oh, Jesus...<eos> I know you love me!<eos> I don't!
- Oh, my gosh!<eos> - Stop now, bitch!<eos> - Run, Debra!<eos> Run!<eos> - Stay here!<eos> I'm not staying here.<eos> - Oh, my gosh.<eos> - N.Y.P.D.!<eos> - I got her!<eos> - Oh, no, you don't!
- Gimme the cash.<eos> - Sure.<eos> There you go.<eos> Don't ever do that to me again.<eos> Okay. D'accord.<eos> Now I'll tell you what we're gonna do.<eos> We're closed.<eos> Mr. Kell sent me.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Now you do.
As the car your father got out of drove off, he turned on his police lights. Are you sure they were police lights?<eos> A cop drove your father there.<eos> - Can you identify the driver?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - Please let me go. - No.<eos> Look, was he black?<eos> Was he white? It was too dark.<eos> If I don't go now, I'm never gonna get clean.<eos> - She knows more than she's saying.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Why not?<eos> I was a little nervous.<eos> I mean, you can be kind of intimidating, Karen.<eos> Intimidating?<eos> Yes, I can be very scary. I know.<eos> So, why were you coming to see me?<eos> Um...<eos> Because I wasn't completely honest with you the last time I saw you.<eos> I said I didn't have any feelings left for you, and...<eos> I did.

Thank you for the latte.<eos> Really hit the spot.<eos> We'll give you a moment. [Door closes]<eos> [Sighs] Savi, I, uh...<eos> I said a lot of things when we were fighting that I... I shouldn't have said.<eos> And I want you to know that...<eos> I-I don't regret everything.<eos> I did love you.<eos> We had some good times, right?<eos> [Chuckles] Yeah, we did.
Congratulations, Toni.<eos> It's a smart move for you.<eos> I think you're gonna do well over there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think I so, too.<eos> And she's humble.<eos> So, you, you tell anybody else yet?<eos> I'm gonna tell the partners on Monday, and I was gonna give two weeks.<eos> Does that sound right?<eos> - Does to me.
[Pen scratches] A girl has needs.<eos> You... Drive a hard bargain. I'm glad we cleared that up.<eos> And no matter how old we get, you have to tell me you love me at least once a day.<eos> - That part's easy. - [Chuckles] Mmm.<eos> [Knock on door] Looks like our little plan worked.<eos> I never realized you were such a good actor.<eos> All that yelling... You scared the crap out of me.<eos> [Chuckles] Listen, um, thanks for helping me with this.<eos> You didn't have to.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Please don't hang up.<eos> I'm in trouble.<eos> And it's serious.<eos> I got mixed up with some bad people.<eos> Paul, who is after you?<eos> You like when people need you.<eos> Dom doesn't need you.<eos> He just loves you.<eos> Savi doesn't deserve you.<eos> She never did.
Sure. Why not?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> So, if the FBI is looking for this Olivos guy and not Paul, then what do you have to do with it?<eos> They need Paul to get to Olivos, and they need me to get to Paul.<eos> How is Paul the key witness?<eos> Apparently, he knows where the money is.<eos> And he's the only one who answered the door when the FBI came knocking.<eos> Well, him and me, of course.<eos> But you don't know where he is any more than the FBI does.<eos> Do you?
Thought you were mad.<eos> - Mad?<eos> Mad at you?<eos> - Why would I be mad at you?<eos> Uh, w-well, no... no... no reason.<eos> I just... [Chuckles] Yeah, I thought you were mad.<eos> Look, Harry, I know...<eos> Deep down, you still hate me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Okay.<eos> You ready?<eos> [Laughs] Uh... I'm ready.<eos> Okay. Hmm. Honey, what is this?<eos> There's a minister downstairs...<eos> - And a... and a harpist at the ready, but I figure, why not break out the Crosley a little early?<eos> That way it's playing when you walk down the aisle.<eos> You don't have to say yes, but, um...<eos> You want to marry me today?<eos> Yeah, I do.
L.A.P.D., Hollywood division.<eos> Detective, how many people have you killed?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know how many people you've killed?<eos> Uh, how is that possible?<eos> I was in the military, first Gulf War.<eos> Re-upped after 9/11.<eos> I did a tour in Afghanistan.<eos> - You saw combat.<eos> - I did.
So it's a homicide.<eos> I can't think of a legit reason to bury a body up here, especially a kid.<eos> Right femur.<eos> "City of Bones."<eos> The grid we laid down is like the blocks of a city, so we know exactly what was found where.<eos> And every murder is the tale of a city.<eos> Who said that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Somebody. Think it's true?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Just like the Red Hawks.<eos> And like the Red Hawks, they hate race-mixing.<eos> If they thought that you and I were together, they would kill you.<eos> Just to send a message.<eos> All I wanted was to protect you from this.<eos> All of it.<eos> No.<eos> I needed to hear this.<eos> I wanted to know all this time why you kept pushing me away.<eos> Now I do.
Is that the case here?<eos> Not that I'm aware.<eos> So?<eos> My hands are tied, Jim.<eos> My client wants his day in court.<eos> No, he wants another week in the press.<eos> He knows public sympathy is building.<eos> Don't let him do it, Jim.<eos> He has no grounds.<eos> I do.
You piss me off, tell me you don't want me in your life anymore -<eos> I had this school friend and she met Robert at a party when she was 23 and they talked together all night.<eos> And then as the sun came up, he proposed to her on the spot and she said yes.<eos> I've been there. Spiked punch.<eos> And now they have three kids, and they're always laughing, and, oh fuck it, Cleave, they just love each other.<eos> I mean, is it so wrong for me to just want that?<eos> And that's what you have with David, sorry, Harry?<eos> Will you please help me?<eos> Sonia Dana, despite all that's happened, do you continue to love your husband?<eos> Yes, I do.
Shut your mouth.<eos> Is there a reason you didn't come to me before you decided to go talk to him?<eos> - I figured you'd say no.<eos> - You figured correctly.<eos> - But I knew you'd want to say yes.<eos> - You knew that?<eos> You put me in an awkward position, Jack.<eos> I had to go because I knew you wouldn't.<eos> If you had gone like you wanted, I wouldn't have had to.<eos> Why didn't you?
it's just not my performance you're watching.<eos> You'll be found guilty and given the federal death penalty.<eos> I'm trying to save your life.<eos> I guess I'll have to save my own life.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> My name... is Bedelia Du Maurier.<eos> You're Hannibal Lecter's therapist.<eos> What's that like?<eos> I've heard so much about you, I feel I almost know you.<eos> - You don't.

He managed his illness with the help of his neurologist, whom he murdered for his trouble.<eos> Is Will Graham an intelligent psychopath?<eos> There is not yet a name for whatever Will Graham is.<eos> He kills methodically, and I believe would kill again, given the opportunity.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Chilton.<eos> Your witness.<eos> Dr. Chilton,<eos> Will Graham spent his time catching murderers for the FBI.<eos> You don't see a contradiction between that and your description of a coldblooded killer?<eos> No, I do not.
It's not even on her teeth.<eos> You dropped it. I'll get it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I'll test the PH levels, see what kind of organic matter or trace elements we come up with.<eos> Should be able to figure out where it came from.<eos> - She has a heartbeat. - What?<eos> - She's in rigor mortis...<eos> - She doesn't have a pulse.<eos> She has a heartbeat.<eos> She doesn't...
- You're lying.<eos> You're all lying.<eos> Will.<eos> Hannibal.<eos> You're lying to each other, and they're lying to you.<eos> Tell me what you believe is happening.<eos> What do I believe?<eos> What do you believe?<eos> Do you believe Will killed Freddie Lounds?<eos> No, I don't.
Great.<eos> So, what's the problem?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just...<eos> Well, if we get the rockets to launch, will they see them from The Ark?<eos> Like the good book says, it's all about burn time and cloud cover.<eos> But I know your mom will be watching.<eos> I've never seen anyone love someone the way she loves you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I did.
- It was fun.<eos> Alicia came to work with me and helped treat cats and dogs.<eos> And one parrot.<eos> His name was, uh...<eos> - Beauregard.<eos> - Beauregard.<eos> He was pretty chatty.<eos> So you had a good day?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I did.
What then?<eos> I'm not going back this time.<eos> I don't care what he does or he says.<eos> Isn't that what you said last time?<eos> I know.<eos> But I didn't walk out last time either.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> You, um...<eos> you want some wine?<eos> I do, but still on duty.
Two cops coming up.<eos> Take care of them.<eos> I'll kiss your girlfriend good-bye for you.<eos> Jared!<eos> Just go!<eos> Stop!<eos> You're a Grimm?<eos> It's okay, Zuri.<eos> You know?<eos> Yeah, he does.
You don't trust her, do you?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> That's why her FBI handlers are staying close.<eos> Can I ask why you don't trust her?<eos> No.<eos> She do something to you?<eos> "No," as in my personal life has nothing to do with this investigation.<eos> Your life includes your sister and your niece.<eos> So maybe it does.<eos> It doesn't.
You find them before the CIA does.<eos> I'm working on our alibi.<eos> Yeah, how's it going?<eos> The kidnapper staged attacks by impersonating law enforcement.<eos> We saw the CIA agents and assumed it was an attack on the soldiers.<eos> We did what we thought was necessary.<eos> And we didn't report it because?<eos> I haven't gotten that far.<eos> - You think we crossed the line?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Moloch would tear me to pieces if he knew.<eos> But I needed to know that I still have some trace of free will left.<eos> You remind me that I am human.<eos> Madam. Care for a lift?<eos> Where's Abbie?<eos> Purgatory.<eos> Step on it, Crane!<eos> Reverse! You don't know how to reverse.<eos> - No!<eos> I do...
You're all right.<eos> Wait.<eos> I couldn't find Katrina's amulet.<eos> My God, you're parched.<eos> Here.<eos> Drink this.<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> Lieutenant, no!<eos> She doesn't belong to you.<eos> You both do now.
Why?<eos> Enough of being married!<eos> - I know this is very hard.<eos> - This is really hard.<eos> This is a lot harder than I thought it was gonna be.<eos> - [Crying] You don't love me.<eos> - No, listen, I really do.<eos> - That's it.<eos> You don't love me.<eos> - No, I really do.
And I have to say, it was one of the greatest [bleep] nights of my life.<eos> I'm a [bleep] beast!<eos> But my night at the mansion had changed me.<eos> Tom... hey.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - Good.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good. Real good.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good, good. Doing well.
They have eyes everywhere.<eos> So, what are you doing down there?<eos> Heard what happened.<eos> I was looking for him.<eos> How'd you know where to find him?<eos> A suspected gang informant got merc'd two weeks ago at that same spot.<eos> Who killed Agent Clark?<eos> I don't know for sure, but that's the Gaki Boyz style.<eos> Why would the Gaki Boyz want Agent Clark dead?<eos> They don't.
- Okay.<eos> Healing power of love, baby.<eos> He is right, though. That could work.<eos> Yeah, what if we hire a gigolo to womp her ass gangnam style, right?<eos> Then, we'll be frying' fish in no time.<eos> Oh, dude, nice.<eos> We know chicks.<eos> Yeah, well, we do know chicks.<eos> But I don't think we need to hire anyone...<eos> - No, we do.
Thank you, Bill.<eos> Uh, I'm gonna give the people what they need... Healthy, organic snacks.<eos> Interesting, because what we need is someone who will shop for what we want.<eos> Amen.<eos> Don't you know people need to be told what they want, 'cause it's actually what they need?<eos> Where'd you learn that...<eos> From your wife that has you on that diet?<eos> Damn!<eos> I don't want to be on his wife's diet. Do you?<eos> - No, I don't.
I got it from here.<eos> This better be worth my time.<eos> It's worth more than that.<eos> Really?<eos> What's that?<eos> Freedom, Agent Burke.<eos> All right, stop.<eos> Look, this could be a setup.<eos> We don't know what's in there.<eos> - I do, evidence.
Then I determine what the job is, pretend to carry it out, and deliver evidence of completion to our mystery man, which, given Rebecca's history, might include murder.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, Diana, truth is, who knows if we even have a case?<eos> You know, I just wanted to bring you up to speed.<eos> Tons of unknowns, and I'm not sure if we'll pursue it.<eos> Peter, I'm in.<eos> A bad guy wants to hire a bad girl to do some really bad stuff.<eos> I'm the best person in the division to keep that from happening.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - I do.
I just came in a little late.<eos> You really didn't have to call Brody.<eos> Don't blame me, it's my maternal instincts - I'm a slave to them.<eos> Suddenly this day has just taken a turn for the better.<eos> Hello, my name is Diane.<eos> I hope you enjoy the softer of the two sexes.<eos> Hi. I'm officer Garcia...and I do.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I thought something happened.<eos> Something did.
No, I'm thinking of transferring to the New York office.<eos> There's a job opening there for a senior litigator that starts next week.<eos> I know you're not going to agree with this...<eos> You want to leave and move to New York?<eos> We both know I should go.<eos> Actually, we don't.<eos> I think you're running away from your problems.<eos> Please don't make this any harder for me than it already is.<eos> I really need to do this.<eos> No you don't!
As long as Gabriel has a baseline.<eos> Baseline?<eos> As long as he knows one of the faces, he can decode...<eos> un-blur the rest of them!<eos> But we don't have any faces.<eos> We might.<eos> That guy who came after you at your mother's house... he could be one of them.<eos> He's the right age.<eos> Do you have a picture of him?<eos> Up here, I do.
You can repay me with services rendered.<eos> Oh, and what service could I possibly render to compensate such generosity?<eos> I'd like you to help my husband.<eos> He's in so much pain.<eos> I can make no guarantees.<eos> I thought this island was a secret known only to a few.<eos> And so it is.<eos> I have to go, but you'll see him... Today?<eos> I have your word?<eos> You do.
Well, if that's what's happening, then you need to prove it.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Uh-uh. FBI is all over me.<eos> I'm being trailed.<eos> They know you've been helping me, so they're watching you, too-- our cell phones, our online activity.<eos> Ryan, I work at the NYPD Intel Division,<eos> I trained with the best CIA techs at the academy.<eos> Do you honestly think that they can trace anything I do online?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You have to stop.<eos> I guess we're done with the small talk.<eos> You think you're helping your uncle, but you're hurting him, and you're interfering with a federal investigation.<eos> Do you have any evidence?<eos> We both know you're smarter than that.<eos> In other words, you can't prove it.<eos> I've seen Ryan's shrine to all things Joe Carroll.<eos> Are you of the opinion that Carroll's alive, as well?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
We'll bring him back.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get away from prying eyes.<eos> Ok.<eos> I got you!<eos> Looks like I've now saved you from both metaphorical darkness and actual darkness.<eos> I think you owe me a beer.<eos> Damon, stop!<eos> You said you had a plan, Bonnie.<eos> I did.
You know, I can do $250,000, but that's really as high as I can go.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - It's $250,000.<eos> - I know.<eos> So, look, dude. I'm not a prostitute.<eos> Well, you still want to go to Paris?<eos> For free?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> I think I should go.<eos> Oh, uh, uh, before you do, just curious.
- Yeah?<eos> - I'm gonna us that bridge there.<eos> - Fair enough.<eos> - Sally, there's no bridge.<eos> - I'm joking around.<eos> - All right, come on.<eos> Come on, let's walk quicker. We need to get out of here.<eos> What's our GPS doing?<eos> You got a signal?<eos> - Does, yeah.
Untraceable, but we believe the kidnapper has been monitoring our daily parent meetings there.<eos> Sir?<eos> Are we a go?<eos> Do it.<eos> What's up?<eos> Go on, I'll catch up.<eos> Beth Ann, do you trust me?<eos> I know you don't trust anybody, but... do you want to trust me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I d... I do.
Okay, thanks.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> No.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> I just wanted to know.<eos> What about my school?<eos> My friends?<eos> I remember when I was your age, and I know that it's tough now...<eos> I don't need a new beginning!<eos> Honey, we both do.
Come here!<eos> Hi.<eos> Detectives Flynn and Vega.<eos> Vega: Diane Torrance?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Teenagers.<eos> You know.<eos> I do.
See you at work.<eos> Okay, what's going on between you two?<eos> He is a ... a very kind and a very good person. Mm-hmm?<eos> Well, since you and I don't have time for a touchy-feely download, can you just tell me, are you planning to see my brother naked?<eos> Jane, I don't want to talk about this with you right now.<eos> You may not know this, but that one ... when he falls, he falls hard.<eos> So you can't mess with his heart, okay?<eos> Uh, I don't think our badges are gonna do too well here.<eos> I can talk my way in anywhere.<eos> Well, then, you do the talking, James Bond.
- What'd I just say?<eos> - Professor Sabbith?<eos> Jacob, you don't have to call me professor anymore.<eos> It's Sloan.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - I love your blog.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - I didn't know you read it.<eos> - God, everybody does.
And all I could say was, "nope."<eos> So, had you rung up a tad earlier, mama might have survived.<eos> The doctor said she died of a broken heart.<eos> Actually, I said coronary artery disease.<eos> Funeral is Sunday.<eos> Meanwhile, George was processing his own loss.<eos> - So, that's it?<eos> - That's it.<eos> But I thought you liked Nora.<eos> I do, just not in that way.
- That's right.<eos> She killed her mama three times.<eos> And, Lord, if she would have seen this little bald girl marching into her Christian home!<eos> Bald girl?<eos> I'm, like... I'm, like, wearing 14 pounds of human hair.<eos> Would have killed her again.<eos> Oh, where are my manners?<eos> Would either of you homicidal maniacs like a sweet tea? ♪ Oooh, oooh ♪ Sweet tea?<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
What a fun family.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They're all downstairs.<eos> Well, then you shouldn't make any loud noises.<eos> It's 8:15. Uh...<eos> I think I lost my balance.<eos> - Lulu, you need to knock.<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> This sheet says Dan has to be tested every two hours to make sure his head is working.<eos> It does?
Mama, I'm so sorry.<eos> I promise, I never meant Frankie to notice me.<eos> Ow, my arm.<eos> It's over, Carmen.<eos> Don't get comfortable.<eos> You're getting me the hell outta here.<eos> You just didn't have the right nurse.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> You need someone with experience in your type of injuries.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Oh. And did you kiss Waylon?<eos> Mm, once.<eos> And then he broke up with me... on my birthday.<eos> And when's that?<eos> The Tuesday after never.<eos> You know that I have security clearance on a federal level, right?<eos> And I also have Lulu.<eos> Um... I don't celebrate my birthdays.<eos> But you secretly want to.<eos> No, I don't.
- Both of you, stop it.<eos> - This is none of your business at all.<eos> Tonight is about Hailee, do you hear me?<eos> Make sure she knows that one's from me.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'm gonna get a drink.<eos> I'll be there in a second.<eos> Hey, D., want a beer?<eos> Papi, yes, I do. You good?
You know, I want a... a true life partner.<eos> I... I think deep down she does, too.<eos> Is this session, uh, 50 minutes or an hour?<eos> 50 minutes.<eos> You know, Ms. Parker, a reluctance to communicate may come from a person's fear of repercussions from their expressed feelings.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> Or silence is a way to control the people who love you.<eos> And you think your wife is trying to control you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
- What time was it?<eos> - Midnight.<eos> - I know because we had to go.<eos> - Where did you leave them?<eos> On the road.<eos> At the edge of town.<eos> - Did they have boyfriends?<eos> Is it true they wanted to leave town?<eos> - Who doesn't?<eos> - I don't.
The whole town smokes American tobacco and there's not a single butt on any of the boats.<eos> They have to get by on something between harvests.<eos> Go in.<eos> Sit there.<eos> - I'm fine standing.<eos> - Sit, damn it.<eos> What were you doing at the hunting lodge earlier?<eos> I was with my girlfriend.<eos> Wanna hear the details?<eos> Yes, I do.
And so you should.<eos> Salutations of the morning to you two ladies.<eos> I am attorney Jacob Edward James of James, James, Jarvis, and James, and, at present, am representing the missing person, henceforth referred to as one<eos> Ian Albert Worthington,<eos> President of the Canadian Bank, brother to Miss Lucretia Worthington, at present sitting to my right, and the fiancé of Miss<eos> Cassandra Chadwick, seated at this moment to my left.<eos> Very pleased to meet you, Miss Worthington, though I do wish it were under more pleasant circumstances.<eos> Well, I apologize for not sharing in your delight, but I've never understood my brother's fascination with dollymops.<eos> You have some nerve.<eos> But yes I do!
No...<eos> Another man came once.<eos> I deemed him a doctor, though he did not say.<eos> He asked me questions that I refused to answer, lest I betray myself.<eos> My mother calls me stupid.<eos> Stupid... ..and too tall.<eos> Fred. You'll find the keys to the safe in the top left-hand drawer of the chest.<eos> You'll find a package in there, marked "Property of Miss Antonia Keville".<eos> I know that name.<eos> Of course you do.
- Hey.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Is Dani here?<eos> - No, she's at an AA meeting<eos> What's up?<eos> She's moving in, huh?<eos> Yeah. How'd you know?<eos> I, uh, bumped into her.<eos> You really love her?<eos> Yeah, I do.
So what's happening now?<eos> We just... we need to go through everything one more time.<eos> But he has to have me in there too, doesn't he?<eos> He's still a minor. Isn't that the law?<eos> No, he's not under arrest.<eos> He's just talking to me.<eos> You don't legally have to be in there.<eos> But if Norman wants you in there anyway,<eos> - that's fine with me.<eos> - No, I-I don't.
It doesn't matter. Is Norman all right?<eos> Norman isn't even near all right.<eos> He's very upset.<eos> He's worried.<eos> He doesn't know what's going on.<eos> What they're doing here, Norma... it's just standard procedure.<eos> Okay, well, when can we go home?<eos> When they've got all the facts down.<eos> You're a lawyer. Do you know how all this works?<eos> I do.
No, honey, no.<eos> He knows you could never do something like that.<eos> - How?<eos> - Because I told him.<eos> But he doesn't even know me.<eos> I told him about you.<eos> So you just told him, and... and he believed it, even though he doesn't know me?<eos> And I told you, and... and you know me better than anyone.<eos> And you didn't?<eos> - And you still don't?
- And you still don't?<eos> - That's not true.<eos> Whether or not you like Cody or if I should have been there, I was there, and I couldn't let him hurt her.<eos> I had to try to help her.<eos> Are... are you mad at me?<eos> Did... did I do something wrong?<eos> - It's not that.<eos> - Well, then what is it?<eos> - Why don't you believe me?<eos> - I do.
I erm...<eos> What?<eos> I've been trying to hack into these SFPD servers.<eos> The new algorithms they have on their... firewall, it's... it's impossible.<eos> - I'm gonna need more time.<eos> - How long?<eos> Probably a couple of days.<eos> We don't have a couple of days, buddy.<eos> How do you even know if the cops even know anything?<eos> Well, maybe they do, maybe they don't.
You got any idea what that thing is worth?<eos> What, like... 100 bucks?<eos> That's a third-model Colt<eos> Dragoon used by Confederate<eos> General William Mahone.<eos> So more than $100?<eos> Probably more than your annual salary.<eos> Though I have a car stereo probably costs more than you make, so that ain't sayin' much.<eos> That's a lot of money for a gun that probably doesn't shoot.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
She keeps the house.<eos> She also sautés up a mean iguana, if you're ever in the mood.<eos> Is very tender.<eos> Rest of the house is clean.<eos> You should see this place.<eos> We got a bowling alley in the basement.<eos> All this for doing Detroit's dirty laundry.<eos> You know what?<eos> When this ugliness blows over, you ought to come on over and do my laundry, and I'll tell you all about it.<eos> We done with him?
It just sucks in here, Boyd.<eos> Long, humiliating days.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, I've been here, too, remember?<eos> You are the only person in the world I got looking' out for me.<eos> I always have and I always will.<eos> Don't lose faith in me now.<eos> So what did you tell her?<eos> That I have the situation under control.<eos> But you don't.
Just that we're still on track for delivery in two days.<eos> Well, for $900,000, I want more than an ETA.<eos> Well, if you boys are looking for a drink, you've come to the wrong bar.<eos> Oh, we're not thirsty, Boyd.<eos> Well, we don't sell doughnuts.<eos> So why don't you take your fat asses out of here?<eos> What, she supposed to mean something to me?<eos> Oh, you don't know her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Yeah.<eos> But what we really wanted, though, was military, but then, you know, you got to be on base all day and shit.<eos> But a lawman, though... a lawman get to have his nights to himself.<eos> So what held you back?<eos> High-school diploma?<eos> Nah.<eos> You know, if you shoot someone, you got to have a reason.<eos> Then you got to go fill out a whole lot of paperwork.<eos> Not for you, huh?<eos> No, we don't do that shit.
Whatever, man.<eos> Come on, Loretta.<eos> Loretta, let's go.<eos> Your call.<eos> Well, thanks for the ride.<eos> You lied to him, didn't you?<eos> Moved the money and didn't tell him.<eos> I'm not a total moron.<eos> Even though you knew it might get him killed.<eos> It didn't.
Abortion calls.<eos> Ma'am, I swear to God, we all thought he was gonna just eat some shrimp, rattle off a few platitudes, go home, watch Full Meta! Jacket for the millionth time and fall asleep.<eos> Kelly, tell Mike to climb off his wife and get on the speakerphone, now.<eos> Do you know what this is?<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> This is POTUS trying to screw me, okay? This is the unflushable turd that is left in the can for the next person, e.g. me.<eos> The toilet's still broken, FYI.<eos> Has POTUS gone nuts?<eos> We can't have a crazy president.<eos> In Italy they do.
Is this the last one, Leash?<eos> I cannot walk another step with my Louboutin heels.<eos> Yeah, Louboutin.<eos> Right. And who wears fake heels at breakfast time?<eos> - Dee do.
I thought Maggie and Glenn would have a baby. And he'd get to be a grandpa.<eos> And we'd have birthdays and holidays and summer picnics.<eos> And he'd get really old.<eos> And it'd happen, but it'd be quiet.<eos> It'd be okay.<eos> He'd be surrounded by people he loved.<eos> That's how unbelievably stupid I am.<eos> That's how it was supposed to be.<eos> I wish I could just... Change.<eos> You did.
To believe in her.<eos> But by the time we're done here, you'll know just how wrong you are.<eos> Hey, look, I found--<eos> You were right about the Deveraux witch.<eos> Find anything about Clara, the mystery witch?<eos> Not much.<eos> She was a nurse at the Fleur-de-Lis Sanatorium.<eos> Recognize her?<eos> Top row, second from the right.<eos> No. I don't.
I ain't trying to be disrespectful at all, but...<eos> I didn't come up like you.<eos> Every day was like a war for me.<eos> And I fought that war for her, and now for my kids.<eos> And they make me want to keep fighting that war for them.<eos> Lukas is dangerous to all that.<eos> You don't have a lot of options.<eos> With everything in my fucking heart, all I know is I've got to protect this.<eos> You know how that feels?<eos> I do.
Sorry.<eos> You can smile.<eos> You're alive.<eos> I get it.<eos> That's not it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tyreese could have made it, Sasha.<eos> We don't know if anybody got out.<eos> No.<eos> We do.
He's a big fan of yours.<eos> I met Tara on the road.<eos> Couldn't have made it here without her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When she heard what I was doing, she said she had to help me.<eos> She's just that kind of person.<eos> What's up?<eos> He just said that he knows what caused the outbreak.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He does.
What way are you going to show him?<eos> He can shoot, we know that.<eos> What's his life going to be?<eos> What's yours?<eos> All this.<eos> I'm just saying everything because I owe you.<eos> We all owe you.<eos> We can make this better now.<eos> Things changing in here doesn't change things out there.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Good.<eos> You found it.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> This isn't as pretty as the front.<eos> We got nothing to hide, but welcome wagon is a whole lot nicer.<eos> Alex will take you, ask you a few questions. Uh, but first, we need to see everyone's weapons.<eos> If you could just lay them down in front of you.<eos> All right.<eos> - I'm sure you understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You're right.<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> I should look him up, to thank him.<eos> Because him abandoning my mom and I for Coco, best thing that ever happened to us.<eos> We bonded, like two peas in a pod.<eos> I mean, sure there was some downsides, like I was never allowed to have Cocoa Puffs in the house.<eos> But that was more than made up for by her teaching me how to shave, and how to drive, and how to hit a curveball.<eos> I mean, we were always together.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have your mom take you to a Bulls game?<eos> No, you don't.
Ah, Father Roche, about that Fidelma Moone situation...<eos> Did you happen to find a little pin cushion in here anywhere, Father?<eos> Eh, What does it look like?<eos> It looks like a little person.<eos> Em, No.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know you've been away, Father.<eos> But I think it is important that this is an inclusive, progressive church.<eos> - You think that that's important?<eos> - I really do.
I always thought it would be Larry, but I think it's time to re-imagine.<eos> This stupid fucking holiday.<eos> Listen, if you want, I can help you forget what day it is.<eos> You know, or your name, for that matter.<eos> You know, no.<eos> I am not interested in being a prize, albeit a shockingly-undervalued one, in your little sex game.<eos> Fine.<eos> I lost my manipulative, gorgeous, psychopath ex and my sweet, kind, unfocused fiancé.<eos> I don't have a home anymore.<eos> Yeah, Chapman, you do.
I'm next!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Me, too.<eos> You know, I gotta see this shit!<eos> Yo! Back up!<eos> Nichols!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Why you pickin' all the peaches?<eos> - I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Thank you.<eos> Now, don't be so juvenile, ladies.<eos> Listen up and learn, okay?<eos> Now, this is your vagina.<eos> This is your labia minora, this, this is your clitoris, and this is your urethra.<eos> This is where you pee from. Ah!<eos> Now, ladies, I want each and every one of you to go back to your bunks tonight and get to know your own chachas, okay?<eos> No fucking way.<eos> I got a mons pubis.<eos> Yes, you do.
- You Catholic?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, this is Catholic plus.<eos> Look, my tía says it doesn't matter if you're praying to a giant cross or to a itty bitty stick, it's the faith that you put in it that counts.<eos> Yeah, but do you believe in, like, spells and magic and shit?<eos> I believe I can use all the help I can get.<eos> You're getting new girls in the kitchen?<eos> - You're not allowed back here.<eos> - Did you put in a request?<eos> What if I did?
I'm just saying, respectfully, that maybe Valentine's wasn't the best day to take a bunch of people to see your gig at a bar.<eos> It's not like people haven't gotten out before.<eos> Take her to Max, stick a few years on her sentence.<eos> The woman's 100 years old.<eos> We're gonna give her more time?<eos> Bell, I want you all over that inmate like a fly on shit.<eos> You follow her.<eos> You find out how she's running.<eos> How about we just ask her?<eos> I already did.
Yes.<eos> That's it.<eos> I don't wanna know anything else.<eos> Please don't tell me anything else.<eos> Yeah, well, it's much worse when you can imagine it in your own head.<eos> Trust me.<eos> This is really over, isn't it?<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want it to be.<eos> Yes, you do.
You can't.<eos> I... I got to go.<eos> Roy.<eos> You haven't said much.<eos> Quietly working on your lecture?<eos> No lecture.<eos> Suppose you think I was wrong about Sebastian too, then?<eos> I think... that you have everyone fooled... because you want people to think that none of this gets to you.<eos> And that you don't need anyone's help.<eos> - I don't.
Leave everyone behind.<eos> I'd go anywhere you told me to.<eos> I had the money, Junia.<eos> I tried.<eos> I try every day to get there.<eos> But I've made some mistakes.<eos> What sort of mistakes?<eos> I took money from my employer.<eos> I invested it with a Wall Street man that said it couldn't lose.<eos> Then it did.
I should head inside now.<eos> Miss Mallon has committed no crime.<eos> She's been tried in no court and has had no due process under the law.<eos> On the word of a few crusaders, she's been shut up in quarantine in a tiny cabin on North Brother Island against her will with the sick and the dying and the diseased, of which she's none of those things.<eos> She wants her freedom.<eos> And I'm here to make certain that she gets it.<eos> Miss Mallon, would you take the stand, please?<eos> Place your hand here, please.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Would you fetch me some of my medicine, please?<eos> What?<eos> I don't like what it's doing to you.<eos> I don't care what you like.<eos> I need to work. I need to concentrate.<eos> So, please, just do as you're told.<eos> - John...<eos> - Now, Nurse Elkins.<eos> You see what it's doing to him?<eos> I do.
I must be going. Enjoy your daydreaming. Ah!<eos> Dreaming is for blokes not smart enough to get what they want.<eos> - Have fun at today's big event.<eos> - Cleary.<eos> Please give Mrs. Robertson my deepest appreciations.<eos> We are all blessed to know her this fine day.<eos> Bertie the Wise. You saw Zinberg?<eos> I did.<eos> - You have information for me?<eos> - I do.
What happened?<eos> You were about a mile east of Eagle Creek.<eos> You were just in a coffee shop down the road just zoning out.<eos> The manager called me, so here we are.<eos> Call... why... why would they... why would they call you?<eos> Do you remember anything?<eos> I've never seen anyone go into a hole like that.<eos> I mean, you were, like, not there.<eos> You take something?<eos> No, I... no, I didn't.
He gave me his card, and we're supposed to discuss something.<eos> Please hold.<eos> Hello, Norma Bates.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for taking my call.<eos> Well, I've actually been waiting for you to call.<eos> I've been thinking about what we talked about at the valet stand, and I have some ideas.<eos> You do?
It might be inappropriate.<eos> I don't...<eos> If you have feelings for him and he's a good person, then...<eos> The first time you have sex should be lovely.<eos> - It should? - Mm-hmm.<eos> It should.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You're old enough that I don't have to lecture you about birth control and STDs<eos> - and...<eos> - Oh, my God, no, you don't.
You can get her something to eat.<eos> She's starved to death.<eos> You mustn't mind your uncle Joss.<eos> There's none round here who don't respect him.<eos> He brings me flowers, see?<eos> Here, sit.<eos> Brandy?<eos> You don't drink, huh?<eos> No?<eos> I do.
Meanwhile, the pageant girls were quenching their thirst from another questionable source.<eos> Tessa:<eos> - Um, what's that? - It's go-go juice.<eos> Oh, you don't know about that?<eos> Everyone does it. Gives them their pluck and sparkle.<eos> You need some?<eos> No.<eos> No. We don't need some.<eos> Alana has plenty of natural pluck and sparkle.<eos> [ Chuckles ] Does she, though?
Take care now.<eos> And my keyboard tech is on a ski trip.<eos> Hey, this isn't about you.<eos> You need a pep talk, call your manager.<eos> "Call your manager." That's what you sound like.<eos> I think I need to be alone.<eos> Old sweatpants.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> - Who says that?<eos> - Well, clearly Amy does, huh?
They're so mysterious, so...<eos> Natural.<eos> Natural?<eos> "Unnatural," I'd say.<eos> Soulless savages.<eos> I assure you, ma'am, the Indians do have souls, if any of us do.<eos> "If"?<eos> And what about witches?<eos> Do they have souls, too?<eos> They do.
- Wh... what do you mean by that?<eos> - No, really.<eos> You could've done a lot better.<eos> Let's face it,<eos> - you could've had a better life.<eos> - Roger, Jesus.<eos> You've said it many times, Ron.<eos> Davina's wasting her life.<eos> - She could've had anyone, Al is a drip.<eos> - I didn't.
- No.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Algie, do you want to keep the child?<eos> Yes.<eos> Stop and think about it a little.<eos> I don't need to think about it.<eos> It's our child, Cornelia.<eos> Keep your voice down.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> I'm calling him.<eos> You think that's a good idea?<eos> That's weird.<eos> No reception.<eos> I got nothing, either.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Tom, you got a cell?<eos> - Yeah. Have a signal?<eos> No, I don't.
- Did you hear that?<eos> - No.<eos> What? It's back there.<eos> Do not go down there!<eos> You're not allowed!<eos> No. Get out!<eos> What's in there?<eos> Nothing. You need to leave.<eos> You have no right to be in here.<eos> Yeah, we do.
- Really? We don't... we don't call it gambling.<eos> You know, w... we see it more as an experiment in probability.<eos> Coach Kotsky, don't you dare try and put lipstick on this pig.<eos> I'm confiscating that pool money when this is over.<eos> I am very disappointed that you have tarnished the good name of Richard Nixon Middle School.<eos> This is why I have to bug all of the offices.<eos> Now let's get back to the fair.<eos> Lily, when you told me about your project on the bus, I thought it sounded good.<eos> I thought you could win.<eos> - Yeah, we both did.
Just curious -- how long before the first Mrs. Feinberg died did you start your affair?<eos> Fascinating method you have, if it is a method.<eos> Mae and I did not have an affair before my wife died.<eos> You're so careful to mention your "deep grieving period," even now.<eos> And, you know, this is not really the house of someone that's sentimental -- quite the opposite.<eos> You're very observant, Mr. Jane.<eos> And perhaps you're right.<eos> I do protest too much.<eos> But I have grown weary and defensive on the subject, as I'm sure you might understand.<eos> I do, I do.
See if anything pops.<eos> You got it.<eos> Jane.<eos> Scooch over.<eos> How often do you sleep in your own bed, anyway?<eos> Oh, I don't like that bed.<eos> Too many lumps.<eos> Maybe you should get a new bed. Mm.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> I always did like this couch.
Now he's asking for our help.<eos> Fortunately, the same jurors are impaneled for another month.<eos> And, under the pretense of a murder investigation, I will face them and determine which ones were bribed.<eos> Or intimidated.<eos> I-I can't believe you got a prosecutor to take part in the con.<eos> It's not a con.<eos> It's a sting.<eos> Sting.<eos> The prosecutor doesn't know that this is not real.<eos> The Attorney General does.
The window.<eos> They released you from the hospital?<eos> I released myself.<eos> This is an active crime scene.<eos> I'm looking for my sister.<eos> We're doing everything we can to find Amy.<eos> But you haven't found her, have you?<eos> Daniela, why'd you come back here?<eos> You told us you didn't know if Amy was even at this house.<eos> I didn't...

Uh, it means that anything I say may be held against me.<eos> Very good.<eos> In a moment, I'll open the floor up to you so you can provide a narrative of events to explain what you were doing and where you were on the date and time of Thomas McAllister's murder.<eos> Objection.<eos> You said "murder".<eos> Thomas McAllister may have shot and strangled himself.<eos> There are no objections here, Mr. Jane, no judge, just a friendly inquiry.<eos> But I take your point.<eos> Do you recall the day of McAllister's death?<eos> I do -- big day.

Please excuse me.<eos> No problem.<eos> No problem.<eos> It's your arms.<eos> They're so sparkly.<eos> Oh, my God. You noticed my glitter lotion?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> It's on me, too.<eos> At least somebody did.
Yeah, but it wasn't like that.<eos> Leanne wasn't a party girl.<eos> I know a lot of girls who get taken all over.<eos> This was professional.<eos> She booked a modeling gig.<eos> And they left four days ago?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Some model scout set it up.<eos> Did you meet this guy -- the model scout?<eos> No, I didn't.
I was in love with her.<eos> I was just a stupid kid.<eos> Why didn't you say anything about this then?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> That would have made everything all right.<eos> I mean, she was 15. I was 18.<eos> You do the math.<eos> Well, for what it's worth, we talked to Christie, and she always thought you were innocent.<eos> She did? Mm-hmm. She said that?<eos> Yeah, she did.
Why?<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> Nope.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'm starving. How's the food here?<eos> Yeah, apparently, it's good.<eos> No burgers.<eos> I wish my wife were here.<eos> Women really love this kind of stuff.<eos> Yeah, they do.
And now you will never forget what your wife experienced all those years.<eos> Is George in some kind of trouble?<eos> Melissa, I need to ask you a difficult question.<eos> Has your husband been abusing you?<eos> No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm aware of your visit to the ER.<eos> You've been interviewed by a caseworker in the past.<eos> We've had some problems.<eos> Every marriage does.
I need you to write down the names of anyone you think might know your plans-- family, friends, anybody.<eos> I didn't tell anybody.<eos> I need to know the name of your husband's lawyer.<eos> Clark Schroeder. Why?<eos> Are you calling him?<eos> Please tell me you can fix--<eos> You broke an immunity agreement, which means you're going to jail unless you start talking about the Alchemist.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> - Got a cigarette?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Sure, yeah, I know all about that-- that and the Betamax and the BlackBerry.<eos> I don't understand the reference.<eos> Nobody wants it.<eos> Uh, hydro is supposed to be a sleep aid, but it's crazy powerful-- too powerful.<eos> The half-life's like 100 hours.<eos> - So?<eos> - So, people need to get up in the morning.<eos> - Where can I get it?<eos> - You don't want it.<eos> I do.
Rifkin and a few dozen Taliban fighters raided an Afghan village, killing dozens of civilians.<eos> At trial, Rifkin's lawyers claimed it was friendly fire, that the American military destroyed the village, from the air, mistaking it for a Taliban outpost.<eos> The military denied it.<eos> So The Judge thinks Rifkin is innocent.<eos> Guys, that Rifkin case you were asking about -- the investigating officer was the Senior FBI Agent in Afghanistan at the time --<eos> Harold Cooper.<eos> You think this is a coincidence?<eos> Reddington feeds you The Judge, and I'm next on that lunatic's hit list?<eos> - We need to take it seriously.<eos> - No, we don't.
What are they doing?<eos> Why are they moving back?<eos> They want to talk.<eos> Ruth, this is not a tactic. I'm not trying to negotiate.<eos> Yes, new information on the Rifkin case.<eos> Someone with high-level access is en route.<eos> Of course.<eos> A woman.<eos> If you came to advocate on behalf of Agent Cooper --<eos> I didn't.
They call Ron "Dad".<eos> This is good.<eos> This is healthy.<eos> I'm creating a connection.<eos> And a diversion.<eos> Run, you idiot!<eos> This way!<eos> Hayley, what did you do?<eos> We have nowhere to go!<eos> Yes, we do.
- Yeah. But it's for you.<eos> Give us The Orb. We can save Shirley Island.<eos> The Orb can't save Shirley Island because Shirley Island is The Orb.<eos> In a cool way like Keyser Soze or a lame way like Jewel of the Nile?<eos> You tell Buzz Hickey that Shirley Bennett said...<eos> Don't wanna waste time.<eos> Think of something cool, give me credit.<eos> But the door I'm knocking on is your home... - ...if I'm the floor, it means you're dead.<eos> - If you're the floor, you're already dead.<eos> Just do it right.
Grew up in Detroit, daughter at 17, work scholarship to Rutgers, joined the FBI right out of college.<eos> Been with the bureau ever since, sir.<eos> You're working the Tate case.<eos> Some relevant information has come to light.<eos> Sensitive information.<eos> Tate is suspected to be in the company of this little girl.<eos> Bo Adams.<eos> A murderer with a kid.<eos> - I hate this kind of stuff.<eos> - We all do.
I mean, like, you can do stuff.<eos> Yeah. I can do really little stuff when I want.<eos> But bigger stuff, I can't really tell when it's gonna happen.<eos> - Well, that sucks.<eos> - It's like hiccups. It starts and then it stops.<eos> And it's usually when I'm mad.<eos> Why do you want to know so bad?<eos> Well, 'cause last I checked we were dead-broke and we don't have a place to stay, so I was thinking maybe your little spooky routine might be able to hustle us up some options.<eos> You want to do something wrong.<eos> - No, I don't.
Hello, baby.<eos> What's this?<eos> Hello, love.<eos> When I saw you at the cafe, I panicked.<eos> If they found out I was working they would take away my benefits.<eos> Oh, that's a bit of a risk.<eos> I needed the money.<eos> Tommy Stonnall.<eos> You told me you didn't know him.<eos> I don't, not really.
We don't always make a lot of friends.<eos> That's Troy.<eos> Is that Ron?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We spent time together in Iraq.<eos> Most of my employees have some sort of military training.<eos> - And who... who's that?<eos> - Bobby Hammond.<eos> - He work here too?<eos> - He did.
If you look at sunlight through a prism, you'll see its spectrum.<eos> When you magnify the spectrum with a telescope, as Joseph Fraunhofer did, you raise the curtain on the electron dance within the atom.<eos> When the energy of the electron flags, and it drops to a lower orbital, the light wave it emits scatters.<eos> Most of it doesn't reach us.<eos> That leaves a dark gap or black vertical line in the spectrum.<eos> These dark lines are the shadows cast by hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere of the Sun.<eos> Sodium atoms cast different shadows.<eos> Their electrons dance to a different tune.<eos> A grain of table salt is composed of sodium and chlorine atoms.<eos> Ten million billion of them doing their crazy dances in a single grain of salt.
Now can we run?<eos> He doesn't see us.<eos> I'm going after him.<eos> And what?<eos> Kill him?<eos> No.<eos> Catch him.<eos> Make him tell me where Octavia is, then kill him.<eos> How do we know he's not leading us to another trap?<eos> We don't.
Other than that, it was great.<eos> Yeah, so the hotel?<eos> We'll stay wherever he does.<eos> - I'm not sure about America.<eos> - Hey, I'll call you back.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - I've just been thinking.<eos> You know, for the first time we're making some good money, and the guys in Chisel are all buying houses...<eos> If you make it in America, you'll be able to afford a house or two.<eos> What if we don't, though?
Emma, speaking for myself... I've known this was right since the moment you walked into my furniture shop.<eos> Why do you think your order was ready two weeks early?<eos> Your commitment to excellence?<eos> I couldn't wait to ask you out.<eos> It seemed the most non-stalkery way to speed things up.<eos> I do love that end table.<eos> That's a start.<eos> I do love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Isn't that obvious?<eos> Yes.<eos> What I meant was, who was it built for?<eos> My mother.<eos> Like you, I've lost people I care about... more than I'd like to admit.<eos> Including a child?<eos> What do you know about that?<eos> I saw the way you grabbed Roland back there.<eos> Clearly, you have the touch of a mother.<eos> I do.
The one thing I haven't had in a very long time.<eos> Someone to destroy.<eos> Maybe this isn't a good idea.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Hey. How was your day?<eos> Good.<eos> Storybrooke is a weird place, but cool.<eos> Did you know there's a library inside a clock tower?<eos> I do.
- No.<eos> Terrible.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Absolutely terrible. Yeah, I went to karaoke a few months ago... and I slaughtered the song "Gypsy" by Fleetwood Mac.<eos> - It's a good song.<eos> - Not the way I sing it.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> It is.<eos> - Dear.<eos> - I do a great Bonnie Raitt karaoke.
I'll see you downstairs.<eos> "I sing the body electric."<eos> The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them.<eos> They will not let me off till I go with them,<eos> "respond to them."<eos> You know what it is?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know what will happen to you if you break it?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, you don't.
Admissions.<eos> I'm Yvonne.<eos> What you got there?<eos> Well, I have just discovered an amazing new product, Yvonne.<eos> Cal-o-Metric for weight loss, specially designed for women.<eos> For example, do you know, uh, how it feels when you're still carrying that extra baby weight?<eos> I've had two myself and, darn it, if it isn't hard to fit back into your favorite...<eos> I didn't have a baby.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Um... I did, and...
Well, he will... when he gets some distance.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You know, it is a rare man that could understand how a woman could choose work over love.<eos> Is that what you told him?<eos> Why you ended it?<eos> It was the truth.<eos> I assumed you were listening.<eos> Bill.<eos> We could have an affair.<eos> Millions of people do.
Both.<eos> Think you have time for some of this?<eos> Maybe if you will loan me your limo. Hmm.<eos> I'm sure we can work something out.<eos> Mm-hmm. Thought you were getting dressed.<eos> I did get dressed.<eos> Then you got undressed.<eos> I got a little hot.<eos> Yes.<eos> You did.
You're my partner.<eos> Well, I already told you how I feel about hiring him.<eos> This doesn't change that.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Seems like something else is on your mind.<eos> He doesn't just want to work together.<eos> He wants us to keep seeing each other.<eos> And you don't want to risk the one to have the other.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
How do you know that?<eos> I told you.<eos> I do my homework.<eos> You lost him, and you needed an outlet, and that's what this company is to you now-- your family.<eos> I told you, I'm not selling.<eos> And I told you, they're coming after you whether you like it or not.<eos> And the difference between me and them is they want to tear your company apart, and I want to keep it together.<eos> You don't have the resources to do that.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
We're staying here all night.<eos> What for? The S.E.C.'s coming,<eos> Jessica's hiring one person to fight 'em, and first thing tomorrow, we need to convince her that person's me.<eos> Hey.<eos> I see you have the movies. Mmhmm.<eos> I guess that means you've decided which relationship you want us to have.<eos> I have.<eos> But it's not what you might think.<eos> If you still want the job, it starts tomorrow.<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> You've done it.<eos> - I did not like it.<eos> Did not like you?<eos> No, it's not for me.<eos> Look.<eos> Remember when I said two years ago... We had to concentrate? Us all to Swedish House Mafia<eos> I do not know whether we then used drugs.<eos> We need to focus our subsequent and our solo things have to give.<eos> Yes, you did.
It used to remind me of mom.<eos> Going down in that plane crash made me feel like, in the end, maybe... instead of being terrified to die, she was brave.<eos> Maybe it wasn't so bad.<eos> Now... it makes me think of you, and how you let me hate you instead of telling me about who she really was.<eos> What do you want, Olivia?<eos> I know that you've been replaced at B613 as command.<eos> I work for the Smithsonian.<eos> My title is chief curator.<eos> I'm just saying I know what happened.<eos> No, you don't.
I tried the dark side.<eos> Turns out you were right.<eos> Didn't suit me.<eos> This whole time, you've been standing up on that podium, playing the good soldier.<eos> My husband's a monster, David.<eos> He's brilliant and ego-maniacal and has done more to thwart the rule of law than you and I will probably ever know.<eos> He's a monster.<eos> And he's powerful.<eos> And he thinks he doesn't have a weakness.<eos> But he does.
Does this usually work?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Is this how you get things done in your world?<eos> Through manipulative, backroom dealings, affected rhetoric?<eos> I had hoped you held your own father in higher regard.<eos> Worth a try.<eos> You are lucky it was me coming out of that restaurant.<eos> If it had been my father...<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> - No, you don't!
Small of her.<eos> She's licking her wounds.<eos> I have no information on that.<eos> All I know is I'm handling the White House.<eos> - I'm your...<eos> - Olivia proxy.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm calling her.<eos> She said you'd say that.<eos> - Did she?
I know you think you're on the right side of this, but you're not...<eos> Believe me, you're not.<eos> What I know is that you are a terrorist, a traitor to your own country.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But I'd rather be a traitor than what you are, Livvie.<eos> Cleaning up those people's messes...<eos> Fixing up their lives. You think you're family...<eos> But you're nothing but the help. And you don't even know it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, I do.

- Gone. - Gone where?<eos> Gone to the White House?<eos> Gone home?<eos> Gone gone.<eos> She left, Harrison.<eos> You need to stop her.<eos> Liv.<eos> I know it's your plane and all, I know she wanted to go.<eos> But this town needs her.<eos> We all do.
Yeah, I was hoping, too, but there's nothing there.<eos> Jerry is Fitz's kid.<eos> Can't win 'em all.<eos> Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know why I'm calling you.<eos> Yes, you do.
Keep this up, you're going to have to buy your own shit.<eos> You got any money?<eos> Can't keep floating you.<eos> You're not a fish anymore.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> I'm not cut out for this place. Stop it.<eos> Ok?<eos> I care about you.<eos> Nobody cares about me.<eos> I do.
There must be!<eos> I'm sorry! I tried to get it over the side.<eos> I couldn't get the barrels over.<eos> No, please, Mr Merlyn, please!<eos> Come on, Legassik.<eos> All this for a stolen horse?<eos> A stolen horse might be what got you in here but ten dead bodies on a beach is what you'll hang for!<eos> What?<eos> Oh, you know nothing of it.<eos> Course you don't.
Curse her.<eos> Arrest Alka right away,<eos> She fired at Bhanu Singh.<eos> Kill me.<eos> I've a bunch of fools.<eos> That's my mom Gulab Devi.<eos> That's my mom Gulab Devi.<eos> Compared to me, God made her really beautiful.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> Yes, I do.
No, see, she's on the federal terrorist watch list, so she's living under a fake identity.<eos> The FBI would arrest her if I met her at the office.<eos> Wow. You live a very interesting life, sweetie.<eos> I know, right?<eos> Anyway, I should probably get going.<eos> Oh, first, wait, um...<eos> Okay, if I was having dinner tonight with a handsome man with a great sense of humor and gorgeous blue eyes...<eos> [Chuckles] what dress should I wear?<eos> Excuse me. Do you have a date?<eos> - I do!
Why did you resort to breaking into the pantry?<eos> We were starving.<eos> The crew had hoarded the remaining food.<eos> And at that point, what was the state of the ship?<eos> People were getting sick.<eos> The air was putrid.<eos> Every time we hit a wave, human sewage would wash down the hallways.<eos> I started calling the boat "the ship of stools."<eos> Hey, Sarah, you remember what you called the promenade?<eos> I sure do.
Ooh... Oh, oh, you'll love this. This is great.<eos> No, no, it's true.<eos> I feel like I won't love it.<eos> You will, you will.<eos> All right, so they were, uh... they were doing this... this shoot for Perfect 10 at my school.<eos> "Perfect Tens of the Big Ten," some shit like that.<eos> Anyway, later that night, some of the girls show up at this party we were having, one thing led to another, and...<eos> Will had a threesome with two Perfect Tens.<eos> Oh, him?<eos> He did that with two Perfect...

Because it did.

All right, the wax is almost ready.<eos> 30 seconds till the deforestation begins.<eos> I can't believe I'm doing this. I mean, the best part of being married, you guys, is that you get to let yourself go.<eos> What about love, companionship, intimacy?<eos> Anyway, you're not doing this for Bobby.<eos> You're doing this for you.<eos> And us.<eos> Seriously, going to the beach with you is traumatizing.<eos> Andi, you're gonna have to trim first. Do you have scissors?<eos> I do.
Leave it to your parents to have a moat surrounding their house.<eos> Why are you so hung up on retracing your steps?<eos> I can't shake this feeling that something happened that night, like I... like I lost time.<eos> And it's the last night anyone saw Zoe.<eos> Okay, you got blackout drunk... it happens.<eos> And it's not like you were abducted by aliens.<eos> And someone did see Zoe later:<eos> Drake.<eos> And you believe him?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Wouldn't look too good.<eos> What are y'all doing?<eos> - Whatever we want.<eos> - Doesn't Wade Messer<eos> - usually run the bar?<eos> - What do you want with<eos> - him?<eos> - Just to talk.<eos> - What did you say your name was?<eos> - I didn't.
Where do you think he gets it from?<eos> I'm the reason he's flunking. That's true.<eos> I start nights tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> You look miles away.<eos> Seven thousand?<eos> That's a joke.<eos> I think I'm gonna go get a glass of water.<eos> You need anything?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You could live there on, like, a dollar a day.<eos> What was that shit?<eos> I didn't sign up for that shit.<eos> That's what terrorists do.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Plant a second bomb, blow up soldiers showing up for the first bomb.<eos> Since when did we become Hamas?<eos> "Approved by the administration."<eos> They give Nobel Peace Prizes for this now?<eos> They sure do.
Then I can't be a part of it.<eos> - It's the Galloway nonsense, isn't it?<eos> - Claire, come on.<eos> It's OK.<eos> You can say so.<eos> We're friends.<eos> - It doesn't help.<eos> - You don't actually believe--<eos> No.<eos> But enough of the country still does.
If we had refused to comment, it would've suggested it was true, which would've endangered the process.<eos> I really had no choice.<eos> - Mr. Feng is currently in Dubai. - I know.<eos> He's fleeing corruption charges, not the first time he's been accused.<eos> - And your question?<eos> - I know he laundered the money.<eos> It's just a matter of time before I have the proof to substantiate that.<eos> So my question, which I am asking again, is whether you knew?<eos> And I'll repeat my answer.<eos> I did not.
So... come on, how'd you two meet?<eos> After the scandal with Betty and Kate, I quit.<eos> And there was this bar I was drowning my sorrows at.<eos> And Helen was a waitress there.<eos> And a good listener.<eos> Yeah, she must be for you to propose so fast.<eos> Actually, that was her idea.<eos> Really? Wow.<eos> She's got...<eos> Yes, yes she does.
Yeah, I think so.<eos> This is so cool.<eos> Mom didn't want me to do yoga until her swami came back from his spirit journey.<eos> Well, I think she'll be fine when she sees how cute you look.<eos> - I'm ... I'm gonna take a picture.<eos> - Can you cc me?<eos> - Say "namaste!" - Namaste!<eos> - Whoo! - Great.<eos> - You know my e-mail address.<eos> - Of course I do.
Bye.<eos> Welcome to the club.<eos> Sid.<eos> You look so tired.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Was there lots of work?<eos> I didn't move from my seat for 14 hours.<eos> You're getting dark circles.<eos> I guess you didn't sleep properly for two days.<eos> I did.
You look so tired.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Was there lots of work?<eos> I didn't move from my seat for 14 hours.<eos> You're getting dark circles.<eos> I guess you didn't sleep properly for two days.<eos> I did.<eos> For a few hours on the recording studio's sofa.<eos> I hope you ate something these last two days?<eos> I did.
Why?<eos> What's the point, bro?<eos> They'll come, see.. lecture me and leave.<eos> It's not..<eos> Forget it, bro.<eos> You're there.<eos> You're like my family, bro.<eos> Even you're like my family, Manav.<eos> But the truth is you have a family.<eos> Like I do.
Ike was fancy.<eos> He only ate peanuts.<eos> Yeah, well, peanuts are natural.<eos> Who the fuck knows what they put in a Corn Nut?<eos> So the chart says that you've been in an accident.<eos> Leg fell asleep.<eos> Foot slipped off the brake.<eos> But then again, you and me,<eos> - we never knew when to stop, right?<eos> - He didn't?
No.<eos> Nurses.<eos> Pennies.<eos> - Harmless.<eos> - No, it's not that.<eos> It's just you were my plans for the evening.<eos> No big deal.<eos> Oh, well, you want to...<eos> Want to come?<eos> Yes, I do.
When I lived in New York,<eos> I would just wait until I got the third late notice.<eos> And then I would go down to the billing office and rub up against the guy at the desk.<eos> I never had to pay.<eos> All right.<eos> I got to go deal with this stuff.<eos> You.<eos> You ran out on your check at breakfast.<eos> You owe me 15 bucks.<eos> No, I don't.
But on the positive side, I don't have to run the 5K.<eos> - What, you're not gonna run the race?<eos> - What's the point?<eos> Jules, the reason you started this was to motivate your dad.<eos> Say what you want about his coaching methods,<eos> Chick was definitely motivated.<eos> But he's too motivated.<eos> It's awful.<eos> Do you know how many towel snap marks I have on my ass?<eos> I actually do.
- Am I about to get punched in the face?<eos> - No, dad.<eos> I brought you here to say thanks.<eos> Even though you show it in amazingly stupid ways sometimes, I know you guys care about me.<eos> And I think you guys are great parents.<eos> Oh, my little boy has gotten so dadgum mature.<eos> Not really helping the adult vibe, mom.<eos> Let's get in there and grab some coffee.<eos> - I think that went okay.<eos> - Yes, it did.
Can my car be red with a silver stripe?<eos> Eh, stripes are pretty cool, but what about a lightning bolt?<eos> (gasps, chuckles) Hey, Wade?<eos> - Wanna hold my salamander, Cecil?<eos> - Heck yeah, come here.<eos> Oh, when he lets you hold Cecil, that means he likes you.<eos> Must run in the family. (chuckles)<eos> Hey, Mom?<eos> Cecil wants ice cream.<eos> Oh, he does?
Stomach pain?<eos> Oh, how bad?<eos> Yeah, it's probably your gallstone.<eos> But I'm in the middle of something, and I...<eos> Honey...<eos> One second.<eos> Oh, sorry, I'll be off soon.<eos> If you have to see a patient...<eos> Uh... no!<eos> I-I don't.
Happy birthday, sweetheart.<eos> This is going better than we ever expected.<eos> She's not even upset.<eos> It's just as likely that that's a very lifelike Candace robot.<eos> Zoey,<eos> I cannot believe you did not tell us your mother was coming.<eos> This is a great surprise!<eos> Well, what's a birthday without a surprise?<eos> You got a special girl, Mrs. Hart.<eos> I do.
The Orion woman.<eos> She's not a threat.<eos> Alright.<eos> I have to deliver a message regarding her owner.<eos> I can show you a copy of my orders if you'd like.<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> I'll be right outside.<eos> Matthew.<eos> I had to see you.<eos> You did?
Of course. Wow.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That ... that was awesome.<eos> It's true what the other guys say ... you are the smartest person to come through here.<eos> Is that what they say?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, Simmons is probably smarter, technically, but that's because she likes homework more than life itself.<eos> Nice to have someone to talk shop with all the time... or to just plain talk to.<eos> You know, um, I didn't like it here at the Academy at first.<eos> - You didn't?
People are asking, "Where is the government?"<eos> The virus has no treatment, no vaccine.<eos> - So this whole weapons test--<eos> - It was all just a cover.<eos> And EMCON Alpha--<eos> Keep us in the dark about what was going on at home.<eos> There's an unmanned refueling station off the coast of France.<eos> If we operate at trail shaft, we should just make it.<eos> How do we know they have enough fuel to get us across the Atlantic?<eos> We don't.
I know.<eos> It's just... she's so... devious.<eos> Cyrus?<eos> - What?<eos> - Where is she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She was right behind us.<eos> I can't believe I fell for it again.<eos> - Alice, we don't know...<eos> - Yes, we do.
Kapo!<eos> Sarak!<eos> You cheating bastard!<eos> Well, it would be difficult to prove I cheated, seeing as you've just ruined the game.<eos> Better luck next time. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!<eos> Enough!<eos> Leave!<eos> Now!<eos> - You'll pay for this.<eos> - Not as much as you did.
Would you like him to correct it?<eos> - Where's the pride, Shawn?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> You have no idea the range of my skill set.<eos> Let's hope to God that you're a fast learner.<eos> - My name is Robert Fino.<eos> - What was your mother's name?<eos> - Didn't have one.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Staley.<eos> My office.<eos> Now.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Excuse me, who was that brazen fellow with the crystal blue eyes?<eos> I'm gobsmacked.<eos> That must be Wim Stuyvesant.<eos> Gee.<eos> How do you say "Suck it" in English?<eos> You just did, Shawn.
- Eating boo berry.<eos> Good for you. Very smart. Feed your body.<eos> So, your mom found out that I never got around<eos> - to giving you the talk.<eos> - What talk?<eos> The..."people making people" talk.<eos> - Ohh, that talk!<eos> - Exactly!<eos> So, if she asks, tell her we just had it.<eos> - But we didn't.
- Have you lost your mind?<eos> ! - I slow-danced with mom!<eos> - What?<eos> - You heard me.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I... slow-danced... with Mom.<eos> You slow-danced with Mom?<eos> - This doesn't concern you!<eos> - What the hell it doesn't!
And maybe in a year or so... I will.<eos> You know, um... I never finished college, so I could always apply.<eos> Don't ruin the hug.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey. How you doing?<eos> Well, I discovered the only thing worse than scoring on your own goal is getting scored into your own goal.<eos> Look, I know you're not enjoying hockey, and I'm not enjoying you not enjoying hockey, so I thought, "there has to be something else we can do together."<eos> Please don't make me play football.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No sports. Done with sports.
While Erica was scheming against Barry, my mom's scheme to get me out of gym class was in motion.<eos> You have Osgood-"Shladder" disease?<eos> Actually, it's pronounced "Schlotter," and there's an article attached.<eos> My hamstrings and ligaments aren't keeping up with my bones.<eos> I'm growing too fast.<eos> You're growing too fast?<eos> Where?<eos> I-it's all in the note.<eos> You really expect me to believe your mother wrote this note?<eos> Yes, 'cause she actually did.
Right. But I do.<eos> "Barry, sorry I was so weird around you.<eos> "American boys intimidate me, "especially the ones who are so good at sports, nunchucking, and frisbee."<eos> She knows about my frisbee skills?<eos> Did she write about the sketch I gave her of us riding a dolphin?<eos> No.<eos> But she did say if you're ever in Paris, look her up.<eos> - Does it really say that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It does.

So now I had to deliver 50 lunches.<eos> And now I have to make 50 more for tomorrow.<eos> And for the life of me, I do not know how to make a-a blueberry into a blow hole ...<eos> A blow hole.<eos> I thought the whole reason this was a good idea was that you didn't like making lunches for the kids.<eos> Can I point out the irony that you're now making 50 lunches<eos> - for kids who aren't even ours?<eos> - I wouldn't if I were you.<eos> - Kate, you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, Pete, I do, okay?
- It should make the highlight reel.<eos> - Right. Can't believe it's already halfway through the season.<eos> - Ah! It's unbelievable.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Time flies.<eos> - Oh, I'll just, uh...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh. Donnie has the ball.<eos> - Oh! He does!
- Graham.<eos> No, not you.<eos> I've said Graham twice now.<eos> Stop.<eos> [laughter] I know. Oh!<eos> - That is good.<eos> - That is good.<eos> So, wait ...<eos> Fern tells us you have really soft hand towels.<eos> - [sighs] I did.
He just moved here from...<eos> Philadelphia.<eos> Yeah, and, uh... you know, Jackie, it's all just really new to us, so we're ... we're ... we're feeling a little bit vulnerable.<eos> Okay!<eos> Well, listen.<eos> If you need me to take Bert for an hour or two, that's great.<eos> - I'd be happy to.<eos> - Oh, that's okay.<eos> That would be great, actually, because we have that, uh, uh, session tomorrow at 3:00.<eos> - We do?
Ah, you better have a good reason for being late.<eos> Oh, I do.
It's a look that's happening!<eos> Watch MTV!<eos> Yeah, I'm sure all the young boys are wearing leopard sweaters.<eos> Hey! That's my leopard!<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Clearly, you're gonna kill me, and...<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I am!<eos> - Do it, Murray.<eos> Do it with your hands.
Well, no, you lose because now you're not getting anything.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> The living room's clean.<eos> - Because other people cleaned it.<eos> - So? You pay Luisa to clean it.<eos> Go to your room.<eos> Oh, by the way, Luisa broke that garbage disposal.<eos> Did you know?<eos> No, you didn't.
Close the door.<eos> You detected a plane a few hundred yards away in a field - that won't protect Britain.<eos> We need to think bigger.<eos> I'm going to make some calls to Oxford and Cambridge, see who we can drum up.<eos> No, I'd like to use men from the weather lab.<eos> My dear man, if we want this to work, we require the very best physicists and mathematicians and we find those gentlemen not at the weather lab but at our oldest universities.<eos> You don't think weathermen are good enough because they don't wear the right tie and all that?<eos> Some of your lot don't wear ties at all, do they?<eos> Look, your little weathermen friends are all well and good, and I'm sure they're perfectly harmless, but they simply do not have the expertise with this particular technology.<eos> Our best professors do.
In the audience?<eos> People aren't gonna be able to see me there.<eos> I think that's okay.<eos> Friends, family, Lisa, Malik, welcome.<eos> Tonight we come together to witness the commitment of Lisa Shay and Malik Lefrique.<eos> Wait. Your last name's Lefrique?<eos> Okay. Hey.<eos> Shh.<eos> Lisa, do you take Malik to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.
I think that's okay.<eos> Friends, family, Lisa, Malik, welcome.<eos> Tonight we come together to witness the commitment of Lisa Shay and Malik Lefrique.<eos> Wait.

Hopefully harmless.<eos> So I'll tell you what.<eos> Double your donation to the charity, stay out of the men's room, and I'll drop the restraining oder.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You will never see me again.<eos> Good.<eos> - Unless you want to.<eos> - Good-bye, Melanie.<eos> Thank God that worked.<eos> It did not!
He listens to problems.<eos> You have problems.<eos> In the movie business, we call this a "meet cute."<eos> In the therapy business, we call that questionable ethics, so...<eos> - I'll quit group.<eos> - How's Saturday night?<eos> See you then.<eos> Look.<eos> You're gonna have your ups and downs and you'll feel like a fraud sometimes.<eos> We all do.
Hmm, a better question would be why is your club security so lax?<eos> Look, you have a restraining order against my friend,<eos> Melanie Moretti.<eos> But it's really all my fault.<eos> She's here, isn't she?<eos> Hi, Corey.<eos> What the hell happened to you?<eos> Oh, I can explain.<eos> You know how in your movies the power of love made awkward girls beautiful.<eos> Well, here it did the opposite.
This is gonna be fun.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> I totally know how to find the skateboarder.<eos> I told you I'd figure something.<eos> Well, his board was covered in stickers, one of which was Trucks Board Shop.<eos> So I figured maybe somebody there would know who he was or where we could find him.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> You called the shop?<eos> Oh, you're deaf.<eos> I totally didn't...
But if he says neither of those things, then I'm just gonna feel mad and sad all over again.<eos> And then what if he's totally unclear about what he's saying?<eos> Then I'm just gonna reread the email over and over again a thousand times until I go crazy.<eos> - Sounds like a lose-lose.<eos> - Exactly!<eos> You know, you're the only person that I've told.<eos> I tried to tell Emmett, but then got totally sucker-punched when he told me about his new girlfriend...<eos> Mandy.<eos> - Why should that matter?<eos> - It doesn't.
Hey.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Kind of a crappy day.<eos> Want to talk about it?<eos> Not really.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's play then.<eos> Well, I kind of have an unfair advantage.<eos> Actually...<eos> I do.
So, it's all good.<eos> I can't thank you enough for letting me stay here while this all gets sorted out. Um...<eos> I'll come get the rest of my stuff when my car's ready, if that's okay?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - And, um, I'll look you up if I ever become a rich and famous author and start collecting art.<eos> - Miranda...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> You have nowhere to go.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You think we should stop.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell me why.<eos> To not die.<eos> You, Maggie, me.<eos> - Yeah, that's not it.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't think you know why you want to stop.<eos> Bob, what happened this morning, we get warnings.<eos> We did fine.
I shot them.<eos> First a man, then a woman.<eos> I didn't mean to shoot her in the head.<eos> You had to.<eos> You saved Tyreese.<eos> Maybe there'll be kids there, even if their parents couldn't keep them safe.<eos> Maybe the kids kept their parents safe.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you have kids?<eos> I did.
I don't even wish I could.<eos> People came in and killed our friends.<eos> And I feel sorry for them.<eos> Why?<eos> Because they probably weren't like that before.<eos> Sooner or later you're gonna have to do it.<eos> You'll have to do it or you'll die.<eos> So you're gonna change the way you think about it.<eos> You have to change.<eos> Everyone does now.
Except for when we had to do stuff like cut up planaria worms.<eos> You've got to do worse than that nowadays, Mica.<eos> - I don't gotta.<eos> - You do.<eos> Lizzie's bigger than you and in some ways she's stronger.<eos> But you're smarter and you understand these... things.<eos> You've got to look out for her.<eos> You have to--<eos> No, go ahead.<eos> You do it.
So that he could swoop in and be her savior?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You can see your mother now.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> It's your first day.<eos> Thought you might like to see a friendly face.<eos> Thank you, but I think I've got it covered.<eos> And there's not a evil preacher teaching Spanish lab.<eos> Well, you never know.<eos> Actually, I do.
Yes. Like college.<eos> Like we've never talked about that before. Every single day of my life.<eos> I figured out what I wanted to do, and I'm doing it.<eos> It's a good thing.<eos> - But on whose dime?<eos> - You're helping Tom with med school. - You helped Anna with law school.<eos> - Sweetheart, those are real careers.<eos> I just don't want you to limit your choices.<eos> - You want to make my choices.<eos> - No, I don't.
- Here we go. It's butternut squash.<eos> Hi, I'm Alice.<eos> I'm so happy you could join us.<eos> - I'm Jenny.<eos> - It's really nice to meet you. - Yeah...<eos> - Well, I think...<eos> I deserve a glass of wine after that, don't you?<eos> - You want white? - Yes.<eos> Thank you. - Does everyone have a glass?<eos> - Yes, we do.
Yeah.<eos> One of those things, but we'll let you go.<eos> It was great to see you, and...<eos> - Wait, whoa, whoa.<eos> - Don't go yet.<eos> When are we gonna get to see Teddy?<eos> - Yeah, that little Teddy Bear.<eos> - No, he's napping now, so we'll try you later in the week.<eos> Did he get those little turquoise cufflinks I sent?<eos> I did, I did, yeah.
Mold.<eos> Mold, mold, mold.<eos> - Mold, fucking everywhere.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I don't understand how you can make it okay in your head, because it's not.<eos> Okay?<eos> And you walk around, like, just because you're building things, everything's even?<eos> Do you think I'm an asshole?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, you don't.
Hey, baby. How's the concert?<eos> Hey.<eos> It's a girl.<eos> Wh...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Justine, I'm sorry.<eos> This one. Not this one!<eos> Yeah, but you said you wanted to wear the... - No!<eos> - Come on, Teddy, you said you wanted to wear the robot shirt.<eos> - I didn't.
Hey.<eos> It's a girl.<eos> Wh...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Justine, I'm sorry.<eos> This one. Not this one!<eos> Yeah, but you said you wanted to wear the... - No!<eos> - Come on, Teddy, you said you wanted to wear the robot shirt.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Yeah, you did.
- Are you worried that we're going to run out?<eos> - No.<eos> It's just, sometimes foster homes don't have a lot of food.<eos> Or they, you know, they keep track of what we eat.<eos> Are you afraid someone's going to come and take you from us?<eos> That's kinda how it goes.<eos> Callie does something, case workers show up, we get moved.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> I know how scary it is, feeling like the rug could be pulled out from under you at any minute.<eos> - You do?
Same way you did.<eos> - You can stop time. Like me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Tell me quick.<eos> - Your mom...<eos> - Yeah, she's safe.<eos> - And Luca?<eos> - Dad, they're both safe.<eos> They need you.<eos> We all do.
Demi's doing her homework,<eos> - I cleaned.<eos> - Wow.<eos> Let me get you some wine.<eos> If whatever is on your mind is that bad, then yeah, I will take that.<eos> And that.<eos> Okay, Honey, listen.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know.<eos> You do?
Mister... Mister... Mr. Zhang is what we call a "game changer,"<eos> Mr. Wen, you'll come to the meeting.<eos> - Me?<eos> Why me? - Him?<eos> Why him?<eos> Well, it's simple, Mr. Moyer.<eos> Last week, you had a shot at a big client, and it's time for Mr. Wen to prove his worth.<eos> Damn right it is.<eos> Also, Mr. Zhang doesn't speak a word of English, and it says on your résumé that you are fluent in Mandarin.<eos> It does?
You look like someone stole your cookies.<eos> No, sir, it's...<eos> It's just that, um...<eos> Are those my cookies?<eos> Anything you leave on your desk is mine.<eos> Uh, have a seat.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I'm trying to tell Jenny that I love her.<eos> She doesn't know already?<eos> Hell, the rest of the world does.
You want to see a film like that on the big screen.<eos> Billy Crystal, 40 feet high?<eos> Doesn't get any better than that.<eos> Anyway, uh, now that I haven't said it, every minute that goes by makes me more and more stressed about it.<eos> Son, have I ever told you what to do in your relationship?<eos> At every single turn.<eos> Then it... it should come as no surprise to you then when you hear me say, now is not the time to tell that girl that you love her.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I thought you liked Jenny.<eos> I do.
Jack!<eos> Oh, my God, Jack!<eos> Jack.<eos> Oh, God, baby, are you OK?<eos> Oh, Mommy was so worried.<eos> I think he's all right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you hadn't stopped when you did, that car might have...<eos> I don't know how he didn't see him.<eos> He did.
No offence.<eos> Wait a minute, you're famous, right?<eos> Did you play Buffy?<eos> Mm, almost.<eos> Sarah Michelle kneecapped me on the way to the audition.<eos> Stop talking to her, okay?<eos> Did you read what's in here?<eos> Depends, would you be mad if I did?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then nope, I didn't.
- But I blew off my bitchy friends and I did everything that I could to prove your innocence so you could come home.<eos> - Does none of that matter?<eos> - It does matter.<eos> I'm very grateful.<eos> So why don't you wanna be with me anymore?<eos> I do. I do wanna be with you, more than anything.<eos> Okay, so then what?<eos> Lacey, I'm sorry.<eos> You just don't understand.<eos> But I do.
Hi, sorry.<eos> I'm Daniel.<eos> Excellent.<eos> This won't take long.<eos> Why are you involving my son?<eos> I'm Vikram's widow and my name's on the policy.<eos> Yes, yes, initially it was.<eos> But Mr. Desai made some changes.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> Uh, no, I didn't.
What is all that?<eos> This is a bunch of random stuff that I picked up at the store... to satisfy any pregnancy cravings.<eos> You know, it's funny, I haven't really had any cravings. It's funny.<eos> Pickles.<eos> Oh, my God, you know what would go really well with pickles?<eos> John Form, we are meant to be together.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Like, mustard and pickles.<eos> Did you get to have your meeting today?<eos> Yeah, I did.
John.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Thank you for believing me.<eos> I didn't know if you would.<eos> Mia, come on.<eos> I love you.<eos> I will always believe you.<eos> Good night.<eos> You think Father Perez can help us?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Then his sons are quite difficult.<eos> I know what that's like.<eos> Could you come to luncheon on Saturday?<eos> Help me cheer him up?<eos> Well, I'd love to. Oh!<eos> Of course, a single peer with a good estate won't be lonely long, if he doesn't want to be.<eos> You sound like Mrs Bennett!<eos> But what's he on about?<eos> He thinks I know something about Mr Bates.<eos> And do you?
Mm-hmm. Okay, then.<eos> Oh, listen.<eos> You might want to keep your wits about you.<eos> - Massimo is up to something big.<eos> - Massimo's dead.<eos> And you and I both know that "dead" don't always mean dead.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Look.<eos> This whole Rainer thing I know it makes me look kind of insane, but I have questions for him.<eos> I do.
Ow, forgotten already?<eos> It's only 20 minutes ago you were down there. Oh. Oh.<eos> You know, books will be written about this.<eos> I'll write the first one of course.<eos> It'll be called The Lewis Solution.<eos> For difficult Fae.<eos> Shit. Something's happening?<eos> Something's on my nose. Get it off!<eos> You have an itch.<eos> Humans do that.
So... your mom was auditioning killers? Ha!<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No, not killers, Ryan.<eos> People.<eos> She just wants to be loved like everybody else.<eos> She just wants someone to understand her and accept her for who she is.<eos> I mean, no one wants to be alone.<eos> So where can I find this guy?<eos> You already know him.<eos> Everybody does.
There's a first time for everything.<eos> Deposit slip.<eos> I already signed it. Want a fresh one?<eos> Nah, I'm sure yours will turn out fine.<eos> Look, we hired you for your contacts, not your reputation.<eos> Hey, about that... boss never told me how you found out about that.<eos> None of your fucking business how we know.<eos> As long as you work for us, this is how it goes.<eos> We don't have a problem, do we?<eos> No, we don't.
Dunbar wouldn't say, but the fact that Feng confirmed the money laundering increases focus on the White House.<eos> As long as we're innocent, which we are...<eos> Raymond Tusk has been subpoenaed.<eos> Why did you ask for this meeting, Bill?<eos> Just keeping us in the loop?<eos> Did you encourage Secretary Durant to offer Feng asylum?<eos> Bill, for godsakes.<eos> The president could have asked me that question himself.<eos> As White House counsel, it is my responsibility--<eos> No, I did not.
This was a result of a productive conversation with President Qian, who gave similar orders to Chinese naval vessels in the same region.<eos> - He moves quick. - Do you mean with the Chinese, or with Walker?<eos> [man on TV] After a grueling night, the four exiles make their way... [knocking on door]<eos> - [man] Mr. Feng? - What is it?<eos> US Justice Department.<eos> We need you to come with us.<eos> - Where?<eos> - You're going back to China.<eos> - I have asylum.<eos> - No, sir, you don't.
I've been thinking about this plane of yours.<eos> -How did you get out?<eos> -Get out?<eos> I'm not a prisoner of war, boy.<eos> Well...<eos> I know you need written permission to leave.<eos> Nah, nah.<eos> That's just red tape.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Whoa, Grandpa. Did you...
You?<eos> I got a few ideas.<eos> I remember the last time I stood with you against an original.<eos> Didn't go so well.<eos> All we gotta do is show that we won't bow down.<eos> Make enough noise, they'll leave.<eos> I figure we can be a lot louder if we're in it together.<eos> Look, Elijah Mikaelson's a dick, no doubt.<eos> Thing is, with him at least I know where I stand.<eos> Do you?
We shall wait no longer.<eos> Stefania Vaduva Popescu is in the castle.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> She's meeting with the Prince now.<eos> - Do you know her?<eos> - I know of her.<eos> My mother knew her well.<eos> She's the biggest black marketeer over there.<eos> Do we know if she's had any contact with Adalind?<eos> No, we don't.
- Get to their hair.<eos> Easier said than... aah!<eos> I'll take the one on the right.<eos> I'll take the one on the left.<eos> What about the really big guy in the middle?<eos> Get off my son! Aah! Aah!<eos> You didn't know what you were up against.<eos> If I... even if you are friends with a Grimm, I couldn't see you die.<eos> How did you know how to kill them?<eos> We didn't.
Um, her... her clothes, but mostly, this... this pendant that she wore.<eos> It was an owl with these big eyes she loved.<eos> Sue Ellen, we want you to look at some pictures.<eos> She can make them big.<eos> Does this man look familiar?<eos> Does the name Mims Shackleford ring a bell?<eos> You know, I did see Tara with a man outside the hotel room the night that she disappeared, but this isn't him.<eos> - There was a man?<eos> - You never told me that.<eos> Oh, I certainly did.
-Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Get it so I can drink vicariously through you.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> Almost there, brother.<eos> -Right by your right hand.<eos> Okay? Yeah.<eos> I'm not telling him, ever.<eos> This did not happen.<eos> Oh, yes it did.
Thank you for the cosmic fuck you.<eos> - Even my own daughter isn't a match.<eos> Anything else you wanna throw at me?<eos> How about a flesh-eating virus, huh?<eos> Wanna toss that in?<eos> What did you say?<eos> - What?<eos> -Your... daughter?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> -Yes, you did. No.
Yes, let's turn up the nitrous.<eos> I know you like that.<eos> My God, it's good.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You know, Ilana, we've been hangin' for a while, and the arrangement we have now is cool-- the ol' sex buddies thing?<eos> I love it, it's dope, 'cause I get to bone a lot.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, you ever thought what it would be like to be in a-- a real relationship-- boyfriend-girlfriend?<eos> It could be great.<eos> "Oh, yeah, Lincoln, I do.
Oh, no.<eos> What the-<eos> No!<eos> Oh, my God, Rick.<eos> How dumb are you?<eos> You're inside a simulation...<eos> Of a simulation...<eos> Inside another giant simulation!<eos> We never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter.<eos> But we do now!
What the-<eos> No!<eos> Oh, my God, Rick.<eos> How dumb are you?<eos> You're inside a simulation...<eos> Of a simulation...<eos> Inside another giant simulation!<eos> We never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter.<eos> But we do now!<eos> We do now, sucka!
Sanne.<eos> Sanne.<eos> There are so many things we haven't done yet.<eos> There's so much I don't know about her.<eos> What she dreamt of.<eos> She hasn't taught me enough yet.<eos> I don't know how to do anything!<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> I need more time.<eos> I really do.
What?<eos> She was also my father's mistress or something.<eos> I saw them kiss.<eos> - That could be<eos> - What?<eos> It's a difficult time.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> What if he loves her?<eos> I don't think he does.<eos> But what if he does?
Why do you want to know?<eos> It's just something I've been thinking about a lot lately, in light of my current situation.<eos> Miranda, were you a virgin?<eos> Was, am, and I guess will always remain.<eos> I got close a couple of times that, that I had more time.<eos> We haven't.<eos> Me and Dillon.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
who're you calling strange, fuzz face?<eos> - We're in!<eos> -I like you.<eos> You've got guts.<eos> Hold onto your stripes.<eos> Cause I'm hunting the greediest, most disgustingest bugs in the meadow.<eos> Honey guzzling soul-suckers.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> I want to meet these nice bugs. No, you don't!<eos> No, she doesn't!
No one hits me!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Sit down!<eos> Helen!<eos> I didn't mean to hurt her.<eos> So you pushed her out of a van going 45 miles an hour.<eos> And kept on driving.<eos> I loved her.<eos> No, you didn't.
I hacked into Harrison Wells' personal files.<eos> He's the director S.T.A.R. Labs, which basically makes me unstoppable.<eos> And look what I found.<eos> It's a prototype for one of their new bio-tech projects.<eos> The patent is still pending, which is probably why they didn't want to tell us what it was.<eos> So what is it?<eos> It's a biotransfuser.<eos> It can deliver blood from one single patient into multiple patients, at once.<eos> Why would Slade need a blood transfusion?<eos> He doesn't.
Well, while we're waiting, we still have a Slade problem.<eos> He's got 20 guys just like him, and we have no way to stop him.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> Mirakuru.<eos> You weren't thinking about taking it, were you?<eos> No.<eos> We're going to use it to make a cure.<eos> Oliver, we don't even know if it's possible to reverse the affects.<eos> Yes, we do.
Not a word you often hear at someone's funeral.<eos> You're not crying for her, Felicity, you're crying for Oliver.<eos> Where is he?<eos> How could he not be here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If Oliver's smart... He ran back to his island to hide.<eos> But maybe he'll attend your funerals.<eos> I always loved this photograph.<eos> I thought your mother looked particularly beautiful.<eos> Well, she didn't.
Let's go.<eos> Diggle, you ready?<eos> Never not.<eos> I'm coming, too.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Felicity can give me a radio.<eos> I'll just be your eyes and your ears.<eos> I'll stay out of your way, I promise.<eos> Nothing will happen to me.<eos> What if it did?
Stay where you are.<eos> I can't move even if I wanted to.<eos> I think my leg's broken.<eos> You should go.<eos> Laurel, I'm not leaving you out here in the middle of this.<eos> The precinct, it's in the other direction.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> No.<eos> I don't need you right now.<eos> Everyone else does.
I made it home because of you.<eos> And I got to see my family again.<eos> But over the past year, I've needed to be more... And I faltered.<eos> But then I stopped you.<eos> Without killing.<eos> You helped me become a hero, Slade.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You think I won't get out of here?<eos> You think I won't kill those you care for?<eos> No, I don't.
No one even had a hand on that.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> ...and this crowd is on their feet!<eos> Varner's back to the line.<eos> Here comes the serve.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> You could have put the gun down.<eos> And gone to jail?<eos> No way.<eos> I don't do time.
Because when I walk out that door... the deal goes with me.<eos> Okay, look...<eos> I'll tell you who hired us.<eos> Decorated war hero.<eos> Never in trouble with the law.<eos> How's a guy like that end up robbing a liquor store?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he was drunk or high.<eos> Doesn't really matter, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
What part would you have changed?<eos> Would you have left the old guy at the altar?<eos> Never said yes when he proposed?<eos> Never even gone after the crown jewels?<eos> Never come to Wonderland.<eos> We should have stayed in Sherwood.<eos> I wish we'd never set eyes on that damn looking glass.<eos> Getting involved with magic... that was the start of all our trouble.<eos> Anastasia and Will... we already had all the magic we needed, right?<eos> That, they did.
Mm. But I know what does.<eos> Take one more step, and I'll take your head clean off your shoulders.<eos> Ohh. Come now, Cyrus.<eos> Is that any way to talk to a lady?<eos> What would your mother think?<eos> You don't know anything about my mother.<eos> Don't let her get in your head.<eos> She's poison, this one.<eos> If Jafar knows we're here, why would he send you?<eos> He doesn't. And he didn't.
I got all confused when you said "honestly".<eos> Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful?<eos> Of course I do. But isn't Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful?<eos> All right, look... we'll come back to that.<eos> No, please.<eos> Don't stop, go on.<eos> Tell me how I'm gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.<eos> That is not what I said.<eos> Look, I think you're really good.<eos> I truly do.
We just have to sit there and take it.<eos> You need to let it go, Sheldon.<eos> You work tirelessly for someone and this is what you get. Oh, my God!<eos> They're just making you use your vacation days!<eos> But I don't want a vacation.<eos> Okay, listen, I don't mean to diminish what you're going through, but I'm a little distracted right now.<eos> Oh, this again?<eos> So, Penny proposed, you didn't say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever.<eos> How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?<eos> - It doesn't!
I'm coming with you.<eos> - Sheldon, stay!<eos> - But...<eos> - I said stay!<eos> I'm going to work.<eos> Do not follow me.<eos> BERNADETTE: Hey, Stuart.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Sorry. Did I startle you?<eos> Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does.
You cock-sucker.<eos> I knew we couldn't trust him.<eos> No, your friends understand the value of my presence, where you are simply a dog with a bone.<eos> Zo didn't want you inserting the key prematurely.<eos> In case it activates a river of lava or... venomous snakes.<eos> So you really imagine the architects of this structure would use the same deception twice.<eos> I see.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Zo meant you no harm.<eos> None of us do.
I am blogging up a storm today.<eos> I just...<eos> I have a...<eos> a surprise for you.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, what is it?<eos> I wouldn't wanna ruin it. You wanna meet me at the dog park in 30?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - I know what it is.<eos> - You do?
Yeah.<eos> I look forward to it. Okay.<eos> So the wife didn't know about it?<eos> Nope.<eos> But he could've bought it on the way to the skydiving center,<eos> I guess.<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Would he do that and not tell his wife?<eos> Hmm. Did Lucas find the bottle that Max threw out?<eos> He did.
Would he do that and not tell his wife?<eos> Hmm. Did Lucas find the bottle that Max threw out?<eos> He did.<eos> 'Cause I've been thinking.<eos> Max said that it really screwed him up and knocked him on his ass, right? Mm-hmm. I wanna know if there's something in it that gave it that extra kick.<eos> You mean besides the alcohol?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I don't get it.<eos> If the scotch was laced, why didn't it show up in the autopsy?<eos> It did.
He says you show a lot of movies.<eos> I like to make learning entertaining.<eos> It's not a smart way to educate.<eos> Everybody else seems to like it.<eos> Well, we're doctors.<eos> Oh... doctors. (Laughs)<eos> How long have you been trying to get that out?<eos> It's on our name tags. (exhales)<eos> We just want to make sure Victor has good teachers.<eos> He does.
He or she shows up, ties him up...<eos> I do not know what that is... he passes out, the guest runs out of here, panics?<eos> - [Cell phone rings] - What do you think? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Flynn.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> We gotta head to the hospital.<eos> We'll see you later!<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> I do.
Show me a tic-tac on the hydrant.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay, tic-tac.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um...<eos> Okay.<eos> That's-- That's pretty good.<eos> Do a cat pass under the hood.<eos> Cat pass?<eos> Do a cat pass.
Step into reality.<eos> Oh.<eos> Ilana?<eos> Are you eating garbage bagels?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Abbi sent me a Facebook invite to her gallery debut.<eos> Do you...<eos> look... crazy?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Well, I was gonna say awesome, but yeah.<eos> Okay, it will be, except I will be imposing the strictest condom policies.<eos> From now on, you will be sending me a picture of every dick that you are about to... host wearing a condom.<eos> Deal?<eos> No deal.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Do you know who's at the top of my mom's gross sex list?<eos> Howie Mandel.<eos> Wait, your mom has a gross sex list?<eos> Yeah, my whole family does.
It's hard to compete with the future of an entire race.<eos> Look, I know you're bummed, but you need a Roman holiday.<eos> And the Winter Blast is our first high school dance ever. I don't have a date.<eos> Em, I need you there.<eos> Every year, they pick one new student to sing at the dance, and Taylor tapped me.<eos> If I go sharp, she'll melt me with one cold hard stare.<eos> Please say you'll come.<eos> Going solo is very "now."<eos> Says the girl with the date.<eos> Not yet, I don't.
Wish we knew what was going on inside the Sector.<eos> Relax.<eos> Um... I need to talk to you.<eos> I'm gonna grab a drink.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I can't.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> I don't need anything from you.<eos> I just figured you deserve to know.<eos> And now you do.
May I have this dance, princess?<eos> May I dance?<eos> Ask your mother.<eos> Of course, you have our permission.<eos> You know that boy?<eos> No, My King.<eos> That is one of the knightsmen.<eos> perhaps.<eos> I have a present for you.<eos> You do?
It looks so good, Josh.<eos> No... Well, it looks burnt, first of all and I'm worried I put it on too hot and it's not gonna be warm in the middle.<eos> That's done, mate.<eos> I can't believe my meat thermometer.<eos> Hey. You know what?<eos> Let's have tequila shots about it.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Joshy!<eos> I'm not having a tequila shot.<eos> Doing a shot? Yeah!
This is hell.<eos> I am so jetlagged and this is hell.<eos> I think the play's been good.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Oh.<eos> I just thought you might be, like, pretty talented at sports.<eos> - No? - I am. I did gymnastics.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You didn't.
Well, Tom gave it to me because Tom was trying to get me tipsy.<eos> I am-I have some more if anyone wants.<eos> Tremendous.<eos> You know, there's something about being jetlagged, it always makes me feel like I'm on my period, you know?<eos> No.<eos> I've been jetlagged before.<eos> It doesn't make you feel like you're on your period.<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.
I am-I have some more if anyone wants.<eos> Tremendous.<eos> You know, there's something about being jetlagged, it always makes me feel like I'm on my period, you know?<eos> No.<eos> I've been jetlagged before.<eos> It doesn't make you feel like you're on your period.<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.<eos> Okay, well, they do.

Hey.<eos> - Hey. - Hey.<eos> Aww!<eos> Josh, is that your sister?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> - Oh, my God. Oh, she's so cute.<eos> I want one.<eos> Don't you guys just want one?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Yeah.<eos> I don't think you can stay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> He loves you.<eos> - He doesn't love me.<eos> - He does. And you love him.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - You do.
But he looks so glamorous.<eos> No, Tom, it doesn't make any sense.<eos> Josh, is this a bad time?<eos> No, no, sorry, my friends are trying to dress John like a girl.<eos> Sorry, what was that? You don't mind?<eos> Of course you mind, okay? You're picky about food.<eos> You're... You're the guy that minds.<eos> No, no, no, I... I eat all kinds of strange things now.<eos> Like, I really like eggplant.<eos> Well, of course you do.
Josh, do you want an ice cream?<eos> No, I'm trying not to be a fat fuck.<eos> Oh, don't swear, Josh.<eos> Your body issues are really flaring up today.<eos> Yeah, Patrick dumped me.<eos> Not that we were really together but, well, you know.<eos> What happened?<eos> More or less, he thinks I'm disgusting.<eos> I knew it wouldn't work.<eos> Did you?
Tom, I'm not coming over to have sex with you.<eos> I just, uh... Been thinking about you a lot.<eos> Lately. Tom, we're never having sex again.<eos> Never ever, ever.<eos> Okay, well, we can just play video games.<eos> Goodbye, Tom.<eos> Patrick, where do you live?<eos> Where do you live?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Uh, uh, see you.<eos> Come on, Hannah. Shall we go?<eos> Let's go. Okay. See you, Josh.<eos> Bye, bye-bye-bye-bye bye bye bye bye...<eos> See you, Hannah.<eos> It's looking good, babe.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Do you want me to stay?<eos> I think Arnold just needs a bit of a rest, Josh.<eos> Yeah, do you...
Let's go. Okay. See you, Josh.<eos> Bye, bye-bye-bye-bye bye bye bye bye...<eos> See you, Hannah.<eos> It's looking good, babe.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Do you want me to stay?<eos> I think Arnold just needs a bit of a rest, Josh.<eos> Yeah, do you...<eos> Do you... Do you want a rest?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I really do.
Nope.<eos> When was the last time you spoke to him?<eos> I don't recall.<eos> Why do I get the feeling you're not cooperating?<eos> Why do I feel like I'm being treated like a criminal?<eos> Mr. Trevino, we're trying to find John before he hurts himself or his son.<eos> Do you have any idea who we're talking about here?<eos> You know he got the Silver Star?<eos> Our unit got ambushed, and John Russell crawled through an open courtyard through machine gun fire so he can drag two injured soldiers to safety. Does that sound like a guy who would hurt his son?<eos> No, it doesn't.
Terry Bell.<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> Queen Bee.<eos> The TV show?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You watch a drag queen competition reality show?<eos> No, well...<eos> Linda watches a drag queen competition reality show and, you know, we only got the one TV, so I gotta watch.<eos> You like it.<eos> No, I don't.
And coming off of 12 years with an absolute harridan of a wife, I was intrigued.<eos> Okay, but you're also surprised, huh?<eos> I mean, when you discovered that she was actually a he?<eos> No, he told me that night.<eos> I was naturally taken aback.<eos> But he was terrific company, and sartorial proclivities notwithstanding.<eos> Okay. So you hit it off.<eos> No secrets.<eos> When'd it all turn?<eos> It didn't, really.
No.<eos> (Sighs) I've been thinking.<eos> Me too.<eos> I said a lot of things.<eos> We both did.<eos> Is it ever gonna get better?<eos> Can't say.<eos> But I do know you need to find that child.<eos> (Stammers) I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Prove it's a transformative artwork and I will agree.<eos> There is a real theft.<eos> This is so cool.<eos> It's like, um... it's kind of like jazz, right?<eos> - It's like legal jazz.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Edelweiss.<eos> Edelman.<eos> Do you know what this meeting's about?<eos> Do you?
Just... give me anything.<eos> - I'll build on it.<eos> - Is this a Hail Mary pass?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is Peter Florrick the dad?<eos> No, Eli.<eos> We've had this conversation.<eos> No, we didn't.<eos> You said you didn't want to have this conversation.<eos> And I still don't.
You might want to sit a different way. I can fully see your net.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Raising money for baseball camp, what does it look like I'm doing?<eos> I used to "raise money" for baseball camp in college.<eos> Hey, don't cut into my profits.<eos> Stop it!<eos> I need this.<eos> Chef Asher cancelled our date for tonight.<eos> He said he didn't think we had a real connection.<eos> - You didn't.
She put me on hold. - Okay.<eos> I want to reinstate the terms of his parole, build a case with your help, purge Kentucky of the Crowe family entire.<eos> I know. Can this wait?<eos> What?<eos> - Well, look around, Raylan.<eos> Big fish in the tank.<eos> You want to talk purge' let's talk later.<eos> What were we talking about?<eos> Mr Dunham.<eos> Boyd, how you doing, brother?
And she told me: "I have good news for you."<eos> Do not laugh!<eos> "Your child is an indigo".<eos> "What?" I asked.<eos> And she said, "Yes,<eos> I felt his energy, I can see it.<eos> You are carrying a child indigo ...<eos> Well, if the seer said ... It's good.<eos> Yes, being the father of Jesus Christ is not so bad!<eos> Do not do that.
When you put it that way, it sounds as simple as beating a man down with his own gun.<eos> - But sir, the thing is...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I've... I've heard enough about your thing.<eos> I told you from the very beginning, that your relationship with Jenny was going to cause problems. (Sighs)<eos> It was fine as long as it didn't impact me.<eos> But that's over.<eos> And I refuse to get sucked up into your relationship.<eos> - I just told Jenny I love her.<eos> - You did?
But that's over.<eos> And I refuse to get sucked up into your relationship.<eos> - I just told Jenny I love her.<eos> - You did?<eos> She didn't say "Thank you," did she?<eos> No! No.<eos> No, Mr. Moyer.<eos> I'm not going to engage in any of that with you.<eos> - She said it back.<eos> - Of course she did.
- You did?<eos> She didn't say "Thank you," did she?<eos> No! No.<eos> No, Mr. Moyer.<eos> I'm not going to engage in any of that with you.<eos> - She said it back.<eos> - Of course she did.<eos> Now get off of my balcony before I ask you if she cried.<eos> - Did she cry?<eos> - She did.
Who gets their first credit card in their 50s?<eos> Same guy who got a Social Security number, driver's license... and all of his bank accounts in his 50s.<eos> James McKinley did not exist before 2013.<eos> - Who was he before then?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But the order to drop the case came down from the C.I.A.<eos> - C.I.A.?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wait a minute. How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
I'll take you to the playground where you used to play.<eos> You do know that the C.I.A. will just get McKinley...<eos> - and his bodyguard out of jail, right?<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> But they won't be able to cover everything up, since I leaked some vital information to Internet bloggers, and the New York Times picked it up.<eos> - Sneaky you.<eos> - That's how I roll.<eos> - I like that.<eos> - But by the way, how did you know that that guy was wearing a bulletproof vest?<eos> I didn't.
For me? Hmm?<eos> _<eos> ... everything since '82.<eos> I need them brought to me, because I need to know...<eos> That would be great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Jeanne.<eos> Have you heard?<eos> My transfer finally came through.<eos> No, I didn't.
You know what you've done?<eos> Nothing wrong.<eos> You've done more damage to Edgehill Records than if you would have burned the building down with everyone in it.<eos> I was taken out of context.<eos> Yeah, and I have been taken to task by a CFO who has been telling me that our stocks have taken a huge hit.<eos> And worse than that, I've had 10 influential radio programmers call me personally to say that they will not play you anymore.<eos> It's gonna blow over.<eos> It has to.<eos> No.<eos> No, Juliette, it doesn't.
Hello?<eos> - So, what now?<eos> - I'm going down to get Julia.<eos> - Wait, what about...<eos> - She wrote the book on viral splicing and RNA binding proteins.<eos> I need her...<eos> We need her to fight this thing.<eos> Alan, we don't know how sick she is.<eos> We don't even know if she can work.<eos> No, we don't.
But if I'm cured, why am I still hallucinating?<eos> I have an even better question.<eos> Why are you hallucinating me instead of Alan?<eos> Sutton is trying to turn me against you.<eos> Of course she is.<eos> I just wanted to let you know.<eos> Sutton can be a dangerous enemy.<eos> I understand.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
- Just tell them to get a divorce.<eos> - That's not an option.<eos> - What would people say?<eos> They're concerned about the social concussions of getting a divorce.<eos> I guess it wasn't as common back then.<eos> Tell them now it's less common for people not to get a divorce.<eos> - Really?<eos> - What?<eos> - Jack, I think I want a divorce.<eos> - You do?
It doesn't matter.<eos> You remember what yours felt like.<eos> If mine feels the same, I know I got nothing to worry about.<eos> I'm not qualified... and you're definitely not Jewish.<eos> You're a grocer whose hands are trained to handle ripe fruit.<eos> Come on, Barney. I'm desperate.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... let me find some plastic gloves.<eos> You used gloves when you felt yours?<eos> No, I did not.
You have no right to kill one of my men.<eos> I had already taken care of that problem.<eos> No, Javier.<eos> You did not.<eos> So we had to.<eos> I built this community with my own hands.<eos> By being evenhanded, fair.<eos> Offering our people a voice.<eos> Violence against our own was only done with absolute necessity!<eos> The Metas do things their own way.
You're bleeding.<eos> I'm fine. No.<eos> No, you're not fine.<eos> I know I'm not fine!<eos> I have never felt so helpless In my entire life, and I hate it so much!<eos> I can't even cast a simple spell anymore, let alone<eos> Stand on my own two feet. That's why you have us.<eos> To stand with you.<eos> I don't have you.<eos> Yes, you do.
He knows that I don't trust him, and so he took something that belongs to me,<eos> - and he messed with it.<eos> - Okay, so give it to me.<eos> Maybe I can figure it out.<eos> - I'll do an unveiling spell.<eos> - I got rid of it.<eos> I didn't want it anywhere near me.<eos> So, the truth is he just could've found your earring.<eos> Joanna, you asked me to come out here to talk about this because you have doubts.<eos> I do.
But you went too far because you don't know how to control your powers.<eos> Powers... what are you talking about?<eos> I am talking about the bolts of electricity that were just coming out of your fists.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - I-I just saw it.<eos> I was here.<eos> No, you didn't. No, you're full of it.<eos> You said you had a patient whose MRI matched mine.<eos> I know that patient was you.<eos> No, you don't.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> And your father will be home soon, so...<eos> We'll be a family again.<eos> As long as the doll stays underwater, no one will ever find the body.<eos> You think this is really gonna work?<eos> Yes, I do.
Of course not.<eos> Why would it be awkward?<eos> Because we kissed and you were almost my brother-in-law?<eos> Ancient history.<eos> I think you know that's not what I'm talking about.<eos> Dash told me, Freya.<eos> About everything.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I know you're a witch.<eos> You do?
He brings out your fire.<eos> Uh-huh. But you're keeping him at arm's length.<eos> - You're scared.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> No, it's-it's okay.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> You've been hurt... a lot.<eos> Do you want to know<eos> - how this turns out?<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Uh-huh. But you're keeping him at arm's length.<eos> - You're scared.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> No, it's-it's okay.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> You've been hurt... a lot.<eos> Do you want to know<eos> - how this turns out?<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - Yes, I do!
- What's a death scorpion?<eos> They're in stasis now, but I can revive them.<eos> And he won't see them coming, because he doesn't know what they are, because we're the ones who invented the spell.<eos> The first sting will paralyse you and the second will kill you.<eos> Even if you're a telepathic, warlock, asshole.<eos> I don't want to kill him yet.<eos> The venom will paralyze him for a couple of hours.<eos> It's enough time for us to find out his plans.<eos> Only problem is, we don't know how to find Tarkoff.<eos> Or maybe we do.
Don't touch me!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I guess I just... "panicked."<eos> I suppose I had that coming, but you need to calm down.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we shouldn't fight?<eos> Because we're family?<eos> Because I can trust... you?<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okete ilu awa orerereo.<eos> Olofi aberikula lomi lorisha.<eos> Okete ilu awa orerereo.<eos> Olofi aberikula lomi lorisha.<eos> Okete ilu awa orerereo.<eos> Olofi aberikula lomi lorisha.<eos> What do you want, Killian?<eos> You know why we're here.<eos> Let's just do this.<eos> Just do this?
Either way, I'll be in touch.<eos> Dr. Gardiner.<eos> Are you upset?<eos> No. Why would I be upset?<eos> Because we just time-traveled and I found out you murdered me?<eos> - It wasn't like that.<eos> - Yeah, kind of was.<eos> I had a very good reason.<eos> That's what you always say.<eos> She really did this time.
He was on his knees when you shot him.<eos> Twice.<eos> Ain't nobody's gonna believe that was self-defense, and you know it.<eos> - You want Jack to grow up without his moms, is that it?<eos> No.<eos> Then quit talking bullshit, okay?<eos> Because I ain't going to prison.<eos> You didn't have to stay.<eos> You didn't have to help me.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Sir, all incoming cadets take photos with mothers.<eos> It's an academy tradition, sir.<eos> Just chill with the "yes, sir," "no, sir" bullshit, all right?<eos> - I ain't your pops.<eos> - Sir, yes, sir.<eos> Did you know Kyle well?<eos> No, ma'am, I can't say I did.<eos> Do you like being here?<eos> The Academy's taught me how to be disciplined, courageous, serve the greater good, to be a man.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I most certainly do.
When have I ever been an embarrassment?<eos> How about the time you got drunk at Christmas mass?<eos> - So you're a virgin, huh?<eos> - What? !<eos> I was talking to the donkey.<eos> I can't believe Woody, of all people, is getting to meet the president.<eos> Trust me, it's not that big of a deal.<eos> Connie, do you really expect me to believe<eos> - that you know the president?<eos> - I do.
Every time I catch him shutting his eyes, I will cut off one of his fingers.<eos> There is nothing that will stop what is going to happen to you.<eos> Trust me, I've been doing this long before you got here.<eos> I'll be doing it long after you're gone.<eos> So, Isles said he knew something?<eos> Did he say what?<eos> I'm not playing this game.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Why'd you say he took early retirement?<eos> - I didn't.
And I'll meet you in 20 minutes, okay?<eos> You know what?<eos> I think I'm just gonna stay in.<eos> - I'm really tired, so...<eos> - Very funny.<eos> You okay?<eos> It's just that we came all the way here to New York, and it was over in 30 seconds.<eos> You had one brilliant idea.<eos> You'll have another.<eos> What if I don't?
Thank you.<eos> Most people.<eos> Well, let's agree that we both have the same goal... rescue a young woman from a harmful lifestyle and install her into a healthy one.<eos> And we use similar tactics to do it, so, in fact,<eos> - we're actually a lot alike.<eos> - No.<eos> The difference is...<eos> I do it because I love this planet to awaken a young woman's spirit.<eos> And you...<eos> Just do it for the money.
I feel a little overdressed.<eos> She's not Lebanese, by the way.<eos> She's Egyptian.<eos> She'd be really offended if you call her a Lebo.<eos> I was thinking about our last time together.<eos> Oh, that weekend in Pretty Beach.<eos> Yeah. Mm.<eos> I distinctly remember you being pro-Native Title, anti-mining and saying that you thought Paul Keating was the most admirable man alive.<eos> I said no such thing.<eos> You did.
I read a report in the Financial Review that Ted Gorman, your king of breakfast, has hinted that he might be leaving at the start of next year.<eos> That must be of huge concern.<eos> Oh well, Ted's a once in a generation talent.<eos> And would you think of Ms Langhorn as a possible replacement?<eos> Eddie's hat will be one of several in the ring.<eos> So I suppose anything that heightened her profile or improved her demographic would be of enormous benefit in securing that show?<eos> Eddie's been bangin' on about this Mary Drouin case long before Ted made his announcement, if that's what you're insinuating.<eos> Yes, but Ted Gorman announces his departure on July the 1st, and on July the 8th, Ms Langhorn goes ballistic and her photograph ends up on the front page of every paper.<eos> And you, as the 17-year operator of one of Australia's most profitable radio networks, really see no correlation between those events?<eos> No, I don't.
I'm going to prom.<eos> Just so you know, dating a high-school guy at your age is creepy.<eos> Also a little bit desperate.<eos> But mostly creepy.<eos> No.<eos> I'm on the alumni committee, and they asked me to chaperone.<eos> And it is going to be awesome.<eos> I always wanted to go to prom.<eos> No.<eos> No, you didn't.
David's not coming home.<eos> He's dead.<eos> There's no proof of that.<eos> And besides... I always feel like if I light a candle for him, it's like this little lighthouse, so that he can find his way home.<eos> Lord, thank you for this breakfast.<eos> Even if it is my last.<eos> And please... please forgive me for all the lives I've taken... including the one I will take today.<eos> Hey, you're driving me to Eric's, so when Mom comes in and tells you, you remember.<eos> I totally knew that.<eos> No, you didn't.

Every aspect of her life totally controlled for one, singular purpose.<eos> She would've been raised without any emotional attachment, so that she could be the perfect like corporate leader, totally able to make decisions based solely on strategic advantage.<eos> So Rachel's evil because mummy and daddy didn't hug her enough. I love you, too, daddy.<eos> Aw.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Well, the psychology makes sense, Sarah. Shit.<eos> I got to go.<eos> It's me. Yeah, well, there's been a problem.<eos> Sarah Manning's gone.<eos> I did, and now, I don't.
Don't go anywhere.<eos> Hello, sestra.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Helena, what are you doing here?<eos> !<eos> I followed you from mother's house.<eos> I shot you!<eos> You were dead!<eos> You were dead!<eos> Yes, you did.
You're going to need more than big socks this morning.<eos> I know this has been sort of confusing, Kira.<eos> I don't blame you for being put out.<eos> But, since we're stuck in this together, there's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun.<eos> And there's no reason why we shouldn't have really awesome socks.<eos> Right?<eos> Sit, please, Paul.<eos> I'm in need of a new monitor.<eos> You have a monitor?<eos> She did.
You make me cry, sestra.<eos> Come on, meathead.<eos> Don't call me this.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Just an intradermal test to see how your body responds.<eos> Yes, if my arm falls off, then we know.<eos> Or if you grow another limb.<eos> Yeah. Ew.<eos> Um... Oh, Dr. Leekie, in light of what you shared with us earlier, we have a proposition for you.<eos> We do?
What lead?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Just one.<eos> I'm a few.<eos> No family, too. Who am I?<eos> Pretty gay, by the looks of this place.<eos> Tony, Beth's dead.<eos> Then I got no business here.<eos> You do, Tony.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Are you going to be all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's got some of your worst qualities.<eos> You're the very best of us.<eos> I know. Hmm. Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Be safe.<eos> Do you want another whiskey?<eos> I got sisters.<eos> That, you do, Tony.
Yeah.<eos> He's got some of your worst qualities.<eos> You're the very best of us.<eos> I know. Hmm. Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Be safe.<eos> Do you want another whiskey?<eos> I got sisters.<eos> That, you do, Tony.<eos> That, you do.
Really?<eos> And where did you get your genetics degree?<eos> I can source another computer.<eos> Anything you need?<eos> No, we're good.<eos> Couldn't get my hands on a 6502 processor, but this one shares a chipset with the 65c02.<eos> He's a virgin, in case you couldn't tell.<eos> Aw, shoot-darn.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Oh, but it did, my good man.
- Ok.<eos> Good.<eos> So do you have any questions for me?<eos> Am I too old to get pregnant?<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - No... not really.<eos> I mean, that would be insane.<eos> The bad kind.<eos> Well, if it's something you want...<eos> I did. Uh...
Any idea what you do need?<eos> Yeah... to be out of the system... on my own.<eos> Then why'd you get yourself arrested and sent back here?<eos> Callie, you're still a kid.<eos> Like it or not, you need an adult to care for you.<eos> Whether it's in the system or back with your foster moms...<eos> No, I can't go back there.<eos> You can send me to a different foster home, or leave me here, I don't care.<eos> Just... I want them to adopt my little brother.<eos> I do.
What?<eos> Callie doesn't want us to be there.<eos> Too bad.<eos> You have to talk to the judge, right?<eos> So that way she can come home.<eos> Unless you don't want her anymore.<eos> Of course we want her.<eos> It is not a question of whether we want Callie.<eos> It is... it is whether she wants us.<eos> - She does.
Well, that's cool.<eos> Nervous?<eos> Harness that energy and focus.<eos> Focus is key.<eos> I really like you, but I love Lexi.<eos> But I really think we need to break up.<eos> If you're interested in using me as sperm donor, I'm in.<eos> If you wanna use Timothy, I think we should get together, all three of us, talk about it.<eos> The lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> - Oh, we don't.
We're ok.<eos> - Good.<eos> So, listen, the adoption lawyer has found your father.<eos> Where?<eos> Not far from here, actually.<eos> North Park.<eos> Now the lawyer spoke to your father, and he has agreed to sign away his parental rights.<eos> That's good.<eos> But the lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> Oh, we don't.
What?<eos> Hanging out with my brothers and sisters?<eos> Listening to a little live music?<eos> Look, I think it's nice and all, but I don't...<eos> Where were those dance moves when we were up there playing?<eos> - Great show.<eos> - You were awesome!<eos> It was amazing, really.<eos> But we have to go.<eos> We do?
So before you consider unburdening yourself of all this guilt, keep one thing in mind.<eos> If your dad finds out, I'm not the only one he'll never forgive.<eos> I might have to figure out a way to live with myself, but I sure as hell don't have to have dinner with you.<eos> Why didn't you tell me Emma came by last night?<eos> Oh, I don't know, maybe because you were upstairs shoving your tongue down Hayley's throat?<eos> I wasn't... she was...<eos> look, this...<eos> This thing with Hayley isn't serious.<eos> You could have said no if you were still hung up on Emma. Why do guys always act like they don't have a choice if a girl wants to have sex?<eos> - We don't!
Your dad said he and Dani were trying out some new recipe tonight.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Uh, Dad had to work late so I didn't stay for dinner.<eos> Why didn't you stay and eat with Dani?<eos> I hope you weren't rude.<eos> We raised you better than that.<eos> - Didn't we?<eos> - I wasn't rude.<eos> I just have a lot of homework.<eos> I still do.
Sort of.<eos> I mean, through Jesus.<eos> I would tell her myself, but I barely know her, so that would make me seem pretty awful.<eos> Ok, look.<eos> I love my brother.<eos> He's my twin and I would totally give him a kidney, anytime.<eos> But when it comes to girls, he can be a little all over the place.<eos> He's just not very good at expressing his true feelings.<eos> If he even knows what he's feeling.<eos> Which, most of the time, he doesn't.
Previously on The Fosters...<eos> As soon as I saw you, I knew there was no need for a DNA test.<eos> Dear Callie, I'm your sister.<eos> Her name's Sophia.<eos> You were way better than her.<eos> She only made the team because she's Latin.<eos> It doesn't even matter whether I'm here or not.<eos> Well, congrats.<eos> It doesn't anymore.
Jesus, let's go.<eos> ♪ 'Cause she's an explosion... ♪ So has your brother said anything about me?<eos> - Who, Brandon?<eos> - No.<eos> Jesus?<eos> Um, no, why?<eos> Well, we... we kinda hooked up at your party, and he said he was gonna call me and he, like, hasn't.<eos> - You hooked up with Hayley?<eos> - No! Who said that?<eos> She did.
Forgive me if I have a hard time taking you at your word.<eos> You volunteered to be our donor.<eos> You said that people like us should have kids, and you wanted to help, anonymously.<eos> And then you...<eos> - I read the contract.<eos> - Yes. And you knew what it was going to say.<eos> You agreed that Stef and I should be the parents.<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> I trusted you because I thought you had integrity.<eos> - I do.
- Great.<eos> It's anonymous then.<eos> - Unanimous.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Ok, well, let's all take Tia to coffee.<eos> Get her to know her a little better. We can't.<eos> Mariana and I have plans after school.<eos> Right.<eos> - You doing all right?
Let's do this.<eos> Hey!<eos> So how'd your interview go?<eos> Oh!<eos> There was a tricky moment or two, but I kinda think I killed it.<eos> Nice! You're totally gonna get it.<eos> What about you?<eos> How was your dance auditions?<eos> Did you guys find your girl?<eos> Oh, yeah. We did.
Yeah.<eos> - So, what do you do for fun?<eos> - School's fun, I guess.<eos> - What about you? - I play guitar, and I hang out with my boyfriend.<eos> Wait, you have a boyfriend?<eos> - What's his name?<eos> - Uh, Wyatt.<eos> Is it serious?<eos> Do you, like, love him?<eos> I do, actually.
Is it because of Liam?<eos> Why don't you just tell Wyatt.<eos> Because, I don't want to.<eos> And I really wish he hadn't involved you.<eos> Well, me too.<eos> But... I know how it feels to love you and not know why you're pulling away.<eos> It's a lonely place to be.<eos> And frankly, it's not OK.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this.<eos> Of course you don't.
Hey, Mom.<eos> I've been thinking...<eos> I want you to keep the commission on the bed, OK?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you, baby.<eos> I know you're angry we don't have the same birth father.<eos> And that I have a half-sister and that I wanted to meet her.<eos> And I know you're angry that we couldn't get adopted together.<eos> And you don't feel like you have any say over anything.<eos> But you do.
I can't trust anything.<eos> And I knew this was gonna happen, Brandon, I knew it.<eos> Come here, come here, sit down with me.<eos> Take some breaths.<eos> OK, just take some deep breaths.<eos> No matter what, they can't make you live with them.<eos> We'll still be your family.<eos> I'm never getting adopted.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes I do.
I'm really sorry.<eos> Me too.<eos> I'm getting out soon and I got no place to go.<eos> - Not like you.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> I can't find one family that wants me.<eos> You got two.<eos> The Quinns?<eos> They don't want me to live with them.<eos> And even if they did, I...
An underground warehouse death-metal battle of the bands?<eos> I'm totally bringing you to 'The Seven Levels of Hell, a Sound Experience That Will Explode Your Eardrums!<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Look.<eos> Nice.<eos> So when did these panic attacks start?<eos> Well, I've been seeing Wyatt for a while now. Uh-huh. And we decided we wanted to have sex.<eos> Ok. Is that something you feel like you're ready for?<eos> With Wyatt, I mean?<eos> I do. I did, anyway.
Yeah, I get it, Sherlock.<eos> Lock up the scene, photograph and bag the evidence.<eos> Routine procedure.<eos> Where's the file?<eos> Case number 45344.<eos> Make sure you tag it, too.<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> I've been in here for a long time.<eos> It walked right to that evidence crate like it knew where it was going.<eos> Not like. It did.
Uh, if... if you tell a lie or even try to cover anything up, that Rothman woman will smell it like a shark does blood.<eos> And you, my friend... will be dead in the water.<eos> I, um, think I need to teach you how to tie this knot yourself.<eos> Oh. You're up, kid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> As you walk through that door, just remember that I'm very proud of you, Rusty.<eos> Very proud.<eos> Remain standing and raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Scarlett O'Connor, meet Liam McGuinnis.<eos> Don't let him scare you.<eos> First time I ever met him, he slammed a door in my face.<eos> Hey, we better get going.<eos> We don't want to be late.<eos> Okay.<eos> Y'all have fun.<eos> And you be nice.<eos> You want to make noise in this marketplace?<eos> Yes, I do.
- But I'll be damned if I stand here in the mother church of country music and pretend to be something that I'm not.<eos> So to all of you out there who want me to beg for forgiveness, who want to burn my records and cancel my concerts, who want to put my career in the ground, this one's for you.<eos> ♪ I thought things couldn't get much worse ♪ ♪ but guess what, they did ♪ ♪ you hit my heart upside with a wrecking ball ♪<eos> ♪ but I'm not going nowhere ♪<eos> ♪ I can live on my prayers ♪ ♪ 'cause I'm done playing nice, I'm done running for life ♪<eos> ♪ 'cause you think that you got me scared ♪ ♪ this time, it's goodbye, trouble ♪<eos> ♪ I feel the light at the end of this tunnel ♪<eos> ♪ I get stronger with every step ♪<eos> Did you know about this?<eos> No, I didn't.
You know, I've wondered... why didn't you take your shot back in the day,<eos> - when you had some heat? - I don't know.<eos> I was... playing guitar for Rayna, writing hit songs.<eos> I guess I just didn't feel like I needed to be famous.<eos> Do you need it now?<eos> I'm not testifying.<eos> I've got a material-witness order that says that you are.<eos> If you don't testify, you will lose all immunity, and that means jail time.<eos> We've got enough evidence to convict you both.<eos> You don't.
Oh, let's, uh, let's see about that.<eos> [Zipper opens] What are you doing?<eos> - Where's this go?<eos> - I thought we had to go.<eos> You are the guest of honor, and we can be fashionably late.<eos> Girls!<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Okay, wait. Wait.<eos> Did...
I mean... uh... Are you okay with it?<eos> I know you two have your history.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm...<eos> You and Deacon and Will Lexington just go off on your tour and have a great time, and I'll just be here, keeping Highway 65 afloat with Juliette Barnes.<eos> - Come here. - [Chuckles]<eos> By all means, just let yourself in.<eos> Door was open.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.
- I'm a guest of Juliette's.<eos> She said you were sending programmers.<eos> Didn't mention anything about you coming by.<eos> Yeah, I suddenly got nostalgic about being backstage at a Juliette Barnes concert.<eos> It's intoxicating, really.<eos> Just couldn't keep away.<eos> Hey, just to be clear.<eos> I don't like the way you treated her.<eos> - Oh. - She deserved better.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - She still does.
Back then, I was just a plain, old drunk.<eos> Rayna tried more times than I care to admit... she tried to get me into rehab, get me fixed up, but, uh...<eos> So, Rayna, when you found out you were pregnant...<eos> Deacon and I were no longer together, and I was dating Teddy and I told Teddy about the baby right away.<eos> We were always very honest about that.<eos> Teddy: That's true, Robin.<eos> I-I did know about the baby right from the beginning, and while I may not be Maddie's biological father, I can promise you that I... I fell in love with her from the moment I held her in my arms for the first time.<eos> And what about you, Deacon?<eos> Do you have a relationship with Maddie?<eos> Yes, uh, I do.
Again, thanks so much for being here.<eos> - Thanks, Robin.<eos> - Man: And we're out.<eos> Robin, thank you.<eos> We appreciate it.<eos> Robin: Oh, any time, Rayna.<eos> You take care, now.<eos> You too.<eos> Tandy: I think that went perfectly.<eos> - You do?
What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I came by to tell you in person how much I can't wait to crank out "Ball and Chain" with you tomorrow night. - Aww. - Mmm.<eos> - Well, aren't you sweet? - Hey, there, Maddie.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - I am excited.<eos> I'm excited for our live stream of "Ball and Chain."<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Me too.<eos> - I thought you hated social media.<eos> I do... for my personal life.
Carlos is a selfish idiot who doesn't know what the hell he's doing.<eos> What ever happened to people helping other people?<eos> Holly, I hate to tell you this.<eos> You're good at your job.<eos> That's so nice of you.<eos> Thank you for that, and for saving me from that maniac.<eos> He was just trying to kill Owen.<eos> Where is Owen?<eos> How did he disappear?<eos> He didn't.
I was gonna get a new one, but I just couldn't bring myself to give this one away.<eos> Lot of memories on that couch.<eos> It's where I first gave you a blow job.<eos> I was just thinking that, yeah.<eos> We were watching Chicago Fire, and you said, "This show is so stupid."<eos> It is. Right.<eos> "Do you want a blow job?"<eos> And I... Do you remember what I said?<eos> You were just like, "Yes, please." "Yes, please."<eos> Because I did.
The kind only Special Forces operators get.<eos> Let's show their photos in the Special Forces community.<eos> - Someone will know them.<eos> - Let's show his photo somewhere else first.<eos> My client is hoping that his cooperation here will be taken into account.<eos> Your client helped take down a drone that would have found those kidnapped kids.<eos> He cooperates or I turn him over to the other parents.<eos> You don't have any kids, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
- Never mind.<eos> It was argued convincingly that your medical expertise is still required.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> -It wasn't me.<eos> The council vote was nearly unanimous.<eos> Apparently, Jake's message woke their better angels, as well.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> We need to talk about those flares.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
He hates when I'm late.<eos> I'm not sharing the tip.<eos> You running out on me, or was I supposed to come back here for a little quickie?<eos> I swear to God, if you show your face here again, I'll report you, and that won't look too good for the lawsuit.<eos> Hey, I know you don't hate me.<eos> You're blushing just looking at me.<eos> I mean, you're ready.<eos> All I got to do is look at you.<eos> We had something.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Soldiers are just digestive tracts on legs, after all.<eos> Have you...had mail?<eos> Mail from a certain lieutenant of the 21st?<eos> I haven't heard from Harry since before we sailed.<eos> I was hoping he'd be in France, but...<eos> Well, if the way he spoke of you to me is anything to go by, he's raring to get here.<eos> Ladies. ♪..a land where summer skies ♪ Are gleaming with a thousand dyes<eos> Sister Haynes!<eos> You remember me.<eos> Of course I do.
Though a little early for Christmas.<eos> Anzac Day?<eos> Never heard of it.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Well...<eos> Today, it's a year since the start of the campaign at the Dardanelles.<eos> Did something special happen there?<eos> Well...<eos> Yes.<eos> It did.
Dooley's not here.<eos> I haven't seen him for a couple of days.<eos> You're giving me a disapproving glower too, are you?<eos> No, not disapproving, but... ..you were rather hard on the poor old chap.<eos> - I don't know what you mean.<eos> - Oh, for...<eos> You do now concede that Dooley likes you?<eos> Well... ..possibly, but...<eos> And you like him too?<eos> Of course you do!
They're looking for the source.<eos> Keep going.<eos> You're gonna make it.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What's happening to him?<eos> Help us!<eos> - Help us!<eos> Help us!<eos> - What do we do?
That's why the first bullet missed.<eos> I've never made the same mistake again.<eos> At the time, you claimed it was self-defense.<eos> It was.<eos> Truth is... you were defending someone else... your mother.<eos> What is your point, sir?<eos> That protection was always in your blood.<eos> Makes me wonder... how far would you go to protect Gabriel?<eos> Do I need a lawyer?<eos> Yes, you do.
I have no regrets.<eos> No?<eos> You went from protecting the president to riding in blind with a malfunctioning robot? Robots don't say ""<eos> You're not a murderer.<eos> I saw what I saw.<eos> I'm on that tape.<eos> It is a very sophisticated frame job.<eos> We both know it.<eos> Do we?<eos> Yes, we do.
Looks like she came alone like we agreed. Good.<eos> So, how do you want to do this?<eos> Stay close, keep an eye on her.<eos> I'll check in with Lillian.<eos> You're making a tragic mistake.<eos> You think you're one of them. You're not.<eos> You're just a piece of hardware to them.<eos> You didn't have to be so alone.<eos> You made that choice.<eos> No, I didn't.
You guys missed the party.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> Go ask him.<eos> We'd like to.<eos> But it's difficult, him being dead and all.<eos> News to me.<eos> You're unbelievable, you know that?<eos> You know he's dead.<eos> I do now.
So, there's been a lot of talk that the bombing at Lee Anne's house was an inside job.<eos> I sure as hell hope not.<eos> I'm thinking of holding a press conference to offer an official reward.<eos> I don't want the public to think I'm soft when it comes to investigating my own.<eos> How mayoral of you.<eos> Something you want to tell me?<eos> I've decided to run, Roy.<eos> I thought you didn't want a job like that.<eos> You know, no glad-handing, double-speaking...<eos> I did.
I got the same feeling.<eos> So what's it gonna be?<eos> You just stirred up the hornet's nest.<eos> You wanted in.<eos> Now you're in.<eos> The defense calls Ingrid Curtwell, the victim's daughter.<eos> I have some difficult questions to ask, Ingrid.<eos> Did your father ever strike you?<eos> Look, I know that this is hard, Ingrid.<eos> I do.
Darren, were you aware Ingrid and Maddox were dating?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you were aware Ingrid's father, Coach Curtwell, was physically abusing her?<eos> Yes. Um...<eos> Ingrid showed me the bruises on her arms.<eos> Coach knew better than to mess up her face.<eos> And how did Maddox react to that?<eos> Said he'd... said he'd make him stop.<eos> Darren, do you know who killed Coach Curtwell?<eos> Yes, I do.
- getting back together.<eos> - No!<eos> No.<eos> See, this is the genius part.<eos> He thought I wanted to get back together, but I just wanted to take the power back.<eos> So I used him this time.<eos> It was awesome.<eos> Because, let's be honest, there's no sex like ex sex.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Well, I didn't before this.
Yeah, well, I realize that, Sara.<eos> Which is why I've been looking out for April, trying to make her feel safe.<eos> It's all I've been able to think about.<eos> So don't talk to me about family loyalty, okay?<eos> Especially since you're the one who's held a grudge against me for years.<eos> You wouldn't even let me come to my own brother's funeral.<eos> You know why I did that.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't want to dwell on the past anymore.<eos> I don't.
All I know is I can't deal with you hating me.<eos> Brenna.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> Look.<eos> It's just hard when you're into girls and you have no idea if they're into girls.<eos> But you hurt my feelings because...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I felt like we had a thing.<eos> I did too.<eos> "Did."
Oh my God, just tell me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm uncomfortable around you.<eos> I don't know what to say, or what not to say, or how to act around you.<eos> I mean, I can't keep being a jerk to you.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> When I was going to work, it was like my only break from all this heavy stuff.<eos> You know, our stupid competitiveness and your whole arrogant Harvard thing?<eos> I needed that to stay sane.<eos> I still do.
When I was going to work, it was like my only break from all this heavy stuff.<eos> You know, our stupid competitiveness and your whole arrogant Harvard thing?<eos> I needed that to stay sane.<eos> I still do.<eos> It's not arrogance.<eos> I'm just smarter than you are.<eos> Seriously, this is the most romantic present ever.<eos> You should write into like "Cosmo" or something.<eos> I'm sure they have a whole column for stories like this.<eos> They do.
- and one who's just like...<eos> - Hey.<eos> I have two perfect daughters.<eos> - When were you gonna tell me?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I didn't even know if you and I were getting back together.<eos> Why do you think I came back here?<eos> I wanted to be here for you, like as your boyfriend.<eos> Since we were only on a break because of distance, I thought you wanted that too.<eos> I did.

So you... You died?<eos> Ugh, yeah.<eos> But it's okay.<eos> Seriously.<eos> I like it here.<eos> I'm always the youngest guy around.<eos> Gerald!<eos> I tried to find you that day.<eos> I needed to talk to you.<eos> No, you didn't.
Previously on Masters Of Sex...<eos> If you keep on like this, you will end up alone.<eos> My mother will go back to Ohio.<eos> So you'll need to get a nanny.<eos> There was a disagreement with, uh, management about my sex study.<eos> And you want to get it going again?<eos> I do.
Gastroenterology is the study of the entire alimentary canal.<eos> All the way from a woman's mouth down to her... Oh... "To bruise her breast immune to pain, to make in her astonished flank a wide and gaping wound."<eos> "Fleurs Du Mal." Baudelaire.<eos> You've read him, of course.<eos> Somehow I missed "Flowers Of Evil." Hmm.<eos> For a Frenchman, he knew a lot about the Greek way.<eos> You know, they didn't invent olive oil just for cooking.<eos> I think this is a significant direction for our new study.<eos> Dr. Greathouse, you wanted me to remind you about your 9:30.<eos> I did, Barbara.
All my sales reports are there.<eos> I sold over $40 worth of products this week.<eos> It's almost double what I did the week before.<eos> Hmm. Be still my heart.<eos> I did all of that without using your sales script, by the way.<eos> No wonder your numbers stink.<eos> I don't... I don't feel comfortable reading from a script that deliberately makes women feel bad about themselves.<eos> And yet women who feel great about themselves don't buy diet products, which leaves us with a... conundrum.<eos> Listen, if you really want to get good at this...<eos> - Oh, I don't.
Austin saw us last night leaving our room together.<eos> A-apparently, his wife is staying with her mother in Alton, so when he takes the kids, he stays at this hotel.<eos> Jesus.<eos> It's not a problem. I handled it.<eos> Says who?<eos> If someone like Austin can walk through here, that means anyone can.<eos> So luckily, there's nothing strange about two colleagues having a drink in a hotel lobby.<eos> Virginia, I am a married man.<eos> You do understand what it would mean if this were to get out.<eos> I do.
Well, Dr. DePaul would never say this, but that kind of endorsement... it would be invaluable to our program, not to mention what it would mean to Dr. DePaul on a more personal level...<eos> coming from you. You see, nobody has stood behind this program.<eos> The administration had to be strongarmed into offering even a modicum of support.<eos> Everything that Dr. DePaul has accomplished here, she has had to do on her own with no help, no guidance.<eos> I did not expect to be impressed this morning.<eos> To be honest,<eos> I did not even remember Dr...<eos> DePaul. But I am always pleased years later to hear that a student considered me their mentor.<eos> No, I didn't say "Mentor."<eos> And neither did Dr. DePaul.
I'm simply wondering if it's worth our consideration.<eos> Dr. Masters' office.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Kenworthy.<eos> Oh, that's fine.<eos> We can...<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Kenworthy just canceled her appointment.<eos> When does she want to reschedule?<eos> She doesn't.
Hey.<eos> It's... it's okay.<eos> You're enough.<eos> That's why I'm trying to say.<eos> It's not like you don't frustrate the hell out of me, 'cause half the time, I want to wring your neck.<eos> But as long as I'm yours and you're mine... that's enough for me.<eos> Uh, dinner is in 15 minutes.<eos> You were saying something about hendricks?<eos> About his, uh, not wanting negroes in the study?<eos> Hendricks doesn't.
Why think closed when the world is open?<eos> Why think small when the world is so big?<eos> So big.<eos> I want to plant a garden in the side yard.<eos> I love gardens.<eos> You plant beans, you get beans.<eos> Carrots become carrots.<eos> Set out to make something grow, and it does.<eos> You wanted a clinic of your own.<eos> Deep down, you probably always did.
Absolutely not.<eos> No, this is my treat, Frank.<eos> End of discussion.<eos> Professor Tolan used to say you were the biggest pain in the ass to ever grace his lecture hall.<eos> I see some things don't change.<eos> It was great seeing you.<eos> Really.<eos> You don't think I drove six and a half hours to discuss Marilyn Monroe's nose job, do you?<eos> I don't know if you heard, but after all my years of bachelorhood debauchery, I finally settled down.<eos> I did.
And how can they say there was a fight when there were people there the whole time and no one saw nothing like that?<eos> I was surprised to read that, too.<eos> I had just come out of the building, and, um, hadn't noticed any sort of altercation.<eos> Look, we got a couple of witnesses who, uh, saw a truck drive by and saw Leonard get dumped out the back, and one of them saw the first three numbers of the licence plate.<eos> And, so, I was wondering if... If maybe you saw anything.<eos> If there are other witnesses, why are you talking to me?<eos> Because most of them are coloured folks.<eos> The few white witnesses won't talk, and the police aren't about to start an investigation based on the testimony of a bunch of negroes.<eos> So if you did see something...<eos> I didn't.
Well, it didn't.<eos> It happened to me.<eos> And I'm sorry that I wasn't emoting enough, but...<eos> Were there tears when it happened?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> A 12-year-old girl-- she cries when she's being penetrated for the first time.<eos> Were you that 12-year-old girl?<eos> Yes, I told you.<eos> Then why not say "I"? "I cried."<eos> Well, I did.
I see.<eos> So the point of dragging me to that meeting wasn't really to share insights about yourself, was it?<eos> Who did you really think you were in that story, Bill?<eos> Me?<eos> Or him?<eos> Think about it.<eos> No, there's nothing-- there's nothing to think about.<eos> He left you, and you left me.<eos> I don't blame you for it.<eos> I did.
Last time I tried to explain the work and why it mattered, I got my hat handed to me, literally.<eos> And if their methods aren't exactly what ours might be, well, then we push back when we can, but we allow them enough latitude to do the job we brought them in to do.<eos> So the end justifies the means.<eos> I know you, Dr. Masters, as well as I think anyone can.<eos> That doesn't sound like something you really believe.<eos> Well, it's easy to be idealistic when your life's work isn't at stake.<eos> Isn't that exactly the time to be idealistic--<eos> To hold on to your principles, to be true to yourself?<eos> I don't need a lecture from you, Lester.<eos> Maybe you do.
I mean, Margaret hasn't left me, although...<eos> what she does with her time...<eos> But I took a leap of faith.<eos> Decided to trust.<eos> I told her.<eos> Everything.<eos> As tough as it's been, at least we're in it together.<eos> I-I never meant... to hurt Virginia.<eos> No.<eos> You never do.
Fantastic.<eos> Hey-hey, it's okay, it's okay.<eos> You're safe in here, Kira.<eos> This truck is made of titanium.<eos> They can't track you in here.<eos> I'd be dead if it weren't for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kira, you must know something about Anton.<eos> That's why they tried to kill you.<eos> I don't.
From what?<eos> Your medication.<eos> - Who gave you this?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> I'm not at liberty to discuss the situation.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> - I have rights.<eos> - You do.
I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> More than anything.<eos> Dr. Sanders told me what happened with you and Kate Renner.<eos> Kate Renner?<eos> How could she know about...<eos> It was decades ago.<eos> Burton Delaney.<eos> - Mary, you couldn't possibly believe...<eos> - Oh, but I do.
Undetermined.<eos> Well, do me a favor, would you?<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Determine it.<eos> Tissue samples, the works.<eos> Dean Lamoureux didn't go quietly into the night.<eos> Hey, Preston, come here.<eos> What's up?<eos> Russ here tells me you two have been doing business together.<eos> He did, did he?
I won't let you down.<eos> Good.<eos> Ms. Sheridan.<eos> James St. Patrick.<eos> Nice to finally meet you.<eos> You're James St. Patrick.<eos> You know, I tried to run a background check on you, and no one in the nightlife world seems to know who you are.<eos> I was expecting a fat Irish guy.<eos> Well, I hope I can meet your other expectations.<eos> I do, too.
Here I come!<eos> I want you to get on your knees and ask for forgiveness for what you have done.<eos> On your knees, asshole!<eos> You killed the only thing I loved in life, you piece of shit.<eos> On your knees!<eos> When I heard you were alive, I realized you were worse than me.<eos> But neither God nor the Virgin of Guadalupe are going to save you.<eos> All you have done won't get you to heaven.<eos> Did you know that I found everyone you helped?<eos> Of course you didn't.
Do you mind just sending them the form so they know you're here legally?<eos> Yes, I mind.<eos> And also I may not be.<eos> To wit, maybe you could make out my checks to cash?<eos> Or bitcoin.<eos> I didn't know I was working with an illegal.<eos> The irony.<eos> Well, sometimes we do center pivot, but mainly we do lineal like you see out there.<eos> What is it your business does again?<eos> Something to do with algebra?
I don't understand. I thought you closed the name.<eos> Well, I guess it's still a little ajar, I don't know.<eos> Who am I, Herb Cohen?<eos> - I don't know who that is.<eos> - Neither do I.<eos> That's a...<eos> That's a Jared thing.<eos> Hey! Make sure to clean off all the gunk off the front bumper, ok.<eos> And since when do we have an intern program?<eos> We don't.
It means I'm taking the warehouse gig.<eos> But you're writing.<eos> Exactly. I mean, not worrying about the writing got me thinking about the warehouse.<eos> And then, the warehouse started making me think, like,<eos> "ooh, that's a pretty good place for a murder mystery setting."<eos> And then, next thing I know, I'm four victims and six chapters in.<eos> It's a bloodbath!<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Sounds like you got it all worked out.<eos> Yes, I do.
What's to discuss?<eos> A movie either stinks or it doesn't.<eos> Thumbs up, thumbs down, get in the car, go home.<eos> Can we talk about this later?<eos> 'Cause I don't want to make Carl late.<eos> He is so punctual.<eos> I know what he is.<eos> I've known him a lot longer than you have.<eos> Okay, clearly you do have a problem with me going to this movie with Carl.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm in. Let's...<eos> let's continue being friends until I die of rabies.<eos> All right.<eos> Dude husband.<eos> - Yeah, dude husbands!<eos> - Dude husband.<eos> It might be soon.<eos> We might all have rabies.<eos> Yeah, we might all have rabies and die.<eos> - We do.
You always been this fucking cocky?<eos> I just hope you can pull it off on your end.<eos> Because rumor on the street is that you've lost a step.<eos> And I'm imagining this rumor was started by...<eos> Somebody had to.<eos> Voila.<eos> Coffee maker.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you have any coffee?<eos> No, I do not.

Is my car still out back or did you move that, too?<eos> It's still there.<eos> Please don't say anything.<eos> To Jax.<eos> I won't.<eos> Patterson grilled the guys.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Everyone at TM and the hospital.<eos> I don't think they have any suspects.<eos> They don't.
I'm trying.<eos> Don't tell her about Miranda.<eos> Too late.<eos> What's the name of the new lawyer?<eos> I'm gotta call him.<eos> I don't want the police to find Dillon.<eos> What?<eos> I want to find him, and I want to kill him.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I do.
If there are many more of that size, I don't know whether this villa is gonna hold.<eos> Ok were else can we go Mykaela?<eos> Sweetie you have been reading books about volcanoes as long as I can remember.<eos> Can you think of some place else?<eos> So place that's safer?<eos> Crap.<eos> Wait.<eos> Christine, do you still have that map of Pompeii?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes I do.
My advise would be close up.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> I got this.<eos> Crap.<eos> No no no no, when I say pull up, I don't mean fly up his ass.<eos> Ok.<eos> Let's see who's got the biggest cojones.<eos> Cane!<eos> You really have to do this?<eos> Yeah he does.
Then it sounds to me like the glee club is saved and that we're moving full-time to the auditorium.<eos> I will have my team review this and get back to you tomorrow.<eos> Uh, and let's hold off on any official announcements until then. Agreed?<eos> Let's get some box wine to celebrate! Wow! Becky.<eos> There's something fishy going on around here.<eos> We're gonna get to the bottom of it.<eos> All right, everybody, I wish I could say that this week isn't about competing against each other, but time for one last diva-off!<eos> And apparently, the only song we can sing in a diva-off is "Defying Gravity."<eos> Wait. So we have to listen to Kurt shred that note again?<eos> For the millionth time, I did it on purpose.
Dad's home.<eos> Prime Minister.<eos> Is it all right if I come in?<eos> Come in.<eos> What made you come home so early today?<eos> Did you come here to say something to me?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> The thing is...<eos> To tell you the truth, Director Kang came just a moment ago.<eos> Director Kang did?
Is that correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's correct.<eos> May I speak with you privately?<eos> Sure.<eos> What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> This case is about sex, and it is my job to ask the tough questions.<eos> You don't get what's wrong with the system here.<eos> I do.
I've collected them since I was a kid.<eos> And since the office is so shorthanded, I'd like to help coordinate the apology tour at the Girlfriends store.<eos> Well pardon-mo. Sorry, Lauren.<eos> I'm back. Apology tour.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Well, we can invite the girl from the YouTube video.<eos> What better way to apologize to America than to first say I'm sorry to her sad little face?<eos> - That is a fantastic idea.<eos> - Oh. I wish I'd come up with it myself.<eos> Actually, I did.
- What's going on?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I would hardly call that mustard.<eos> - Sweetheart, can I borrow your doll?<eos> - No. Well, how about if I give you a quarter?<eos> I-I have a quarter here somewhere.<eos> This is literally the poster for "stranger danger."<eos> I told you.<eos> She's mine, and I want to hear what she says.<eos> Oh, no, you don't, you really don't.
Okay, mom.<eos> - That was a little sarcastic.<eos> - Little bit.<eos> Oh, thank goodness.<eos> I was going to come look for you.<eos> Jane said you weren't coming back.<eos> - Oh, I'm back.<eos> - She does not give up.<eos> Did you get my text?<eos> I did.
[New Jersey accent] Well, she was just begging for it, always busting my *** all the time.<eos> I always thought you were the coolest girl at school.<eos> [Chuckles] You girls are too cute.<eos> Too cute.<eos> Anyway, with the twins away at Harvard, we spend most of our time at the Turks and Caicos house.<eos> Hmm. Well, congratulations, Tina.<eos> You win.<eos> Win? [Scoffs]<eos> Well, Debbie, I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Sure, you don't.
Useless! You two are totally useless.<eos> Oh, honey, I know it's hard.<eos> But you are gonna get over Reggie.<eos> Let go.<eos> I'm totally over Reggie.<eos> It's been three weeks, and, in case you forgot, I broke up with him.<eos> Well, it... it doesn't seem like you're really over him.<eos> So...<eos> Really?<eos> It doesn't?
Why would I be jealous of a ruggedly handsome fellow who wears size-14 sandals and enjoys easy banter with my wife?<eos> Larry, jealousy will only cause you trouble.<eos> That's why I'm not jealous that Debbie doesn't want me to hang out with her study group, even though I raced home from work just so I could party with them.<eos> See?<eos> I'm not jealous.<eos> Now I get to sit and watch daytime ESPN.<eos> Marty, I'm not jealous, but maybe my body was.<eos> Clearly, it got confused and reacted to feelings I wasn't feeling.<eos> That doesn't make much sense. Or does it?<eos> - It doesn't.
- No, this...<eos> - Hey, George.<eos> - Hey. Do you mind if I stand here?<eos> - Madam Vice President.<eos> - Sure, sure, go ahead.<eos> - Great.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I was really, really worried.<eos> Don't be worried. Have you been fishing?<eos> Doing a little bit.
Isolating the audio...<eos> Let's see if this works.<eos> Indeed it does.<eos> That's ancient Aramaic.<eos> - "Ancitif cannot be defeated." - Ancitif?<eos> "Ancitif..."<eos> "A powerful demon that has been known to jump between bodies on contact."<eos> "First cited in 1647, when it possessed a group of catholic nuns."<eos> So... this is the demon that wanted me dead.<eos> And likely still does.
- Okay.<eos> They're after our daughter, aren't they?<eos> Frank, I'm an attorney.<eos> I might be able to help if you just let me.<eos> I didn't wanna worry you with the details.<eos> You walk around with the weight of the world on your shoulders.<eos> Why do you think that you have to carry it alone?<eos> She did not get hurt because you weren't there.<eos> - You have to know that.<eos> - I do.
Hello, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> Brock's in the cafeteria recruiting guys for a new and improved Red Hawks.<eos> He says it's your idea.<eos> I was gonna talk to you about this.<eos> You're serious?<eos> I got the inside track with the Atrians, okay?<eos> Found out about this terrorist group... they're called the Trags.<eos> And you know this how?<eos> I just do.
Fight!<eos> Always remember to finish off your opponent, if you can.<eos> We're fine ones for playing dead or pretending to run away.<eos> Perhaps the Saxons are the same.<eos> No man ever ran away with his entrails hanging to his knees, or his head cut off.<eos> That's just a fact of life.<eos> Your mother is an amazing woman.<eos> I know.<eos> And... I know why you say that.<eos> No you don't.
And now his brother touches you...<eos> What should I do now?<eos> Who would want to share you with the world?<eos> Your beauty is venomous.<eos> They have given him a pistol... to kill uncle Khurram...<eos> - Ghazala Akhtar...<eos> Do you accept Khurram Hussain Meer as your lawfully married husband?<eos> I do.<eos> - Do you accept?<eos> I do.

I think he is telling us.<eos> Tell us more about this job.<eos> Well, as you know, back in my hippie days, a business man came into my coffee shop, told me money was all that mattered, and stole my girlfriend.<eos> That's when I decided to become awesome.<eos> But I had no idea how to break into the corporate world.<eos> So, hoping he wouldn't recognize me, I went to the one person from whom I knew I could learn everything.<eos> Do we know each other, bro?<eos> We're all connected in Gaia's great tapestry of...<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
Then why are you naked?<eos> Oh, what the hell?<eos> When I got to the club, it had already closed.<eos> By the next day, some super inconsiderate person had taken my umbrella.<eos> But by that point, I didn't care.<eos> I knew that if I really wanted to end poverty, I had to get a degree in economics.<eos> So... to answer your question, that's how I got here.<eos> I meant, how did you get here from the subway station? Oh. But I'm only asking 'cause I just moved to town.<eos> I don't even have a place to live yet.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Shelby...<eos> And when I told you I was leaving, you pretty much showed me the door.<eos> That is not fair.<eos> You didn't fight for me, Roy.<eos> That's why I left.<eos> Not for money.<eos> Because I wanted to be with someone who thought I was worth fighting for.<eos> (Chuckles) I think you've always wanted to be with a completely different kind of woman.<eos> And I hope someday you find her, Roy.<eos> I really do.
You have qualities they're looking for.<eos> Hey, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> - I need a gun.<eos> - Who you gonna kill? You wearing cologne?<eos> No.<eos> It's Kenyatta's perfume soap shit.<eos> - You use another dude's soap?<eos> - So what?<eos> - It's got pubes on it. - No, it doesn't.<eos> Yes, it does.
Six hundred dollars for your information. - So who stole it?<eos> - I give up.<eos> Who?<eos> No, not who stole it, like, guess who stole it.<eos> Who stole it like which one of you fuckers stole my money?<eos> Why do you think we stole your money?<eos> - Because you knew where I hid it.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In the damn keg!<eos> - Ooh! We do now.
- Yeah? How long?<eos> - Ninety days or less.<eos> All right.<eos> I suppose we'll manage.<eos> - Or I could go to trial.<eos> - Why would you want to do that?<eos> - Why wouldn't I do that?<eos> - Because you'll get convicted.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- I don't give a shit about it.<eos> -Why not? I don't know, I mean you really think it's something that is gonna help us out in the real world?<eos> Oh, so you're not planning On running the Federal Reserve, huh?<eos> - Are you?<eos> -Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I doubt I will. So why are you here, then?<eos> I'm here to talk the tutor into giving me some extra credit points, and then, I'm gonna split.<eos> Well, I hope that works out for you.<eos> Always does.
There is only Moriarty.<eos> And Moriarty is never gonna change.<eos> 3-1-David, 3-1-David, you have a 10-10 Disorderly Male, corner of 155th and Riverside.<eos> Suspect wearing a gray hoodie.<eos> Please check and advise.<eos> Dispatch, this is 3-1-David.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> Sir, how we doing today?<eos> You're up.<eos> Buddy, how you doing?
Right?<eos> As long as Gabriel has a baseline.<eos> Baseline?<eos> As long as he knows one of the faces, he can decode -- uh, un-blur the rest of them!<eos> But we don't have any faces.<eos> We might.<eos> That guy who came after you at your mother's house -- he could be one of them.<eos> He's the right age.<eos> Do you have a picture of him?<eos> Up here, I do.
Yes!<eos> Okay, that should be the seed value-- the -- the key code for the blur.<eos> Now you should be able to use the code to try -- It's working.<eos> Weatherly.<eos> All this time, it was right in front of me, and I never saw it.<eos> No one saw it.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I spoke to him this morning after they found Tetazoo.<eos> Did he tell you where he was going?<eos> Yeah. He did.
'Try it again.'<eos> Too bad we have to do it again.<eos> - But look at all the rivers around there.<eos> - That's him.<eos> - I just want to make sure it is correct.<eos> - And still, and you follow.<eos> - But look good.<eos> - We'll be turning if it is okay or not.<eos> - You have to think again ...<eos> - No, we do not.
I'm the father of two daughters.<eos> When they are of marriageable age nobody will bother about my uniform or my honesty.<eos> It's because of you dowry-mongers that we have to take a cut.<eos> lam from the girl's side.<eos> If you want an out of court settlement leave forty lakhs at the designated spot or else I'll arrest all three of you in 498a.<eos> Okay sir, okay...but where's the guarantee that after the deal this DVD won't reach the commissioner.<eos> What if they want more?<eos> Did they guarantee they will not ask for more dowry after the marriage?<eos> Tell me...<eos> Did they?
Wait.<eos> Just wait.<eos> Shane, I know you're in there, and I know you can hear me.<eos> Hey.<eos> I won, Shane.<eos> And if you die on me, I'm gonna tell everybody we know I won.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it now.<eos> You got lucky.<eos> Yes, I did.
Do what?<eos> Ask questions and lie.<eos> Especially about him.<eos> We know what he did to you, Violet.<eos> Gina told us everything.<eos> You found her?<eos> Did you find Daisy, too?<eos> Her real name is Sheila.<eos> Sheila Woods.<eos> And, yes, we did.
Where's Astrid?<eos> She's dead.<eos> She told Mark and the rest of them that she was leaving with you.<eos> Mark didn't like that.<eos> She fought them, and then they, uh, came for Josh.<eos> I'm so sorry, Kenny.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I don't even know how to feel.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes you do.
He found me! [Wolf growling] He always finds me!<eos> I'm so, so sorry!<eos> - You know exactly what to do.<eos> - No, I can't fight him!<eos> He always wins!<eos> That's the problem!<eos> You can't fight him.<eos> Confrontation is standing up, looking something in the eye and being honest.<eos> - I don't know how to do that.<eos> - Yes you do.
- The old woman?<eos> Why?<eos> - She's Julia's mother.<eos> - Your mother?<eos> - Just let me make sure she's all right.<eos> Go.<eos> I always knew you were capable of murder, but mass murder?<eos> What are you talking about? You're telling me you know nothing about the outbreak in Puerto Rico?<eos> NARVIK A. You don't know about that?<eos> Of course he does.
Ms. Marcus is suing the city of Charleston<eos> - for wrongful termination...<eos> - Okay, Jamie.<eos> - And defamation of character.<eos> - Game on.<eos> They have a tape.<eos> It's footage of you and three other men having sex on a police car.<eos> They must've slipped something into my beer.<eos> We had something.<eos> Yeah, we did.
No further questions.<eos> I'd like to call as my next witness Betsy Lewis.<eos> Mrs. Lewis, in what capacity do you work at the Charleston police department?<eos> I'm the secretary to the deputy chief of police.<eos> Have been for 27 years.<eos> So you work for Holland Knox?<eos> Yes.<eos> I used to work for his predecessor Wes Tarkington.<eos> Jamie: And when you worked for deputy chief Tarkington, did you ever see a copy of a statement of complaint submitted by my client Lee Anne Marcus?<eos> Yes, I did.
Care to comment?<eos> "When asked if Joe Carroll was alive, Ryan Hardy dodged the question."<eos> I'm not dodging anything except for maybe your pathetic attempt at journalism.<eos> Is that a yes or a no?<eos> I interviewed a private pilot who claims you are convinced that Joe Carroll was trying to get on his plane.<eos> Why would he lie about that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he was trying to lie his way into your next book.<eos> We both know the truth doesn't matter to you.<eos> Yes, it does, Ryan.
Fuckin' Trav.<eos> We were like family.<eos> It were great when we was neighbors.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> I know.<eos> But that time's passed.<eos> We fucked 'em though, didn't we?<eos> Did a lot of damage.<eos> Remember them cells at Hindley, don't ya?<eos> Yeah. 'Course I do.
Now roman is involved?<eos> Commissioner, this sounds like a coincidence That you are turning into a conspiracy.<eos> You felt yourself something was wrong.<eos> Did you or did you not see Steven Marcato in your building?<eos> I don't know if I did.<eos> I haven't been myself since I've been pregnant.<eos> I wouldn't trust my instincts if I were you.<eos> I trust mine, And I think there's something here.<eos> Did you know Nena Pascal was pregnant?<eos> No, you didn't.
There's a hidden wall.<eos> It's a passageway.<eos> It's a secret passageway into our bedroom.<eos> Yes.<eos> I finally know what they're doing.<eos> It is an old building with old rooms.<eos> There's nothing secret about that.<eos> Don't use that tone with me.<eos> I know what they want, Guy.<eos> I finally do.
That's how he was able to change building plans without anyone knowing.<eos> If he's the arsonist, we have to find him.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> He's here.<eos> Kimball!<eos> Don't move.<eos> The basement! Is there a way out?<eos> Is there?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The hell you don't!
Nice tux. Ahh. - You again.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My God, what do you do, you live here?<eos> No, I just eat here. Niners.<eos> - What?<eos> - Niners.<eos> I mean, you asked me the-- yesterday if I was a raiders fan or a niners fan, and I'm telling you, a niners fan.<eos> So I can talk to you now?<eos> I have your permission?<eos> - Yes, you do.
Okay.<eos> I'm sad you're leaving.<eos> - I missed you, drew.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I was thinking about it tonight, just...<eos> And watching you with all your friends, and you're just such an amazing guy, and I always have so much fun with you.<eos> I feel really horrible about the way things ended between us.<eos> Yeah, that was bad.<eos> You know, I-- I get it, though.<eos> I do.
I do know Erin.<eos> She alleges herself to be a waitress.<eos> You know, in fact, she missed the lunch shift today.<eos> What'd she get picked up for?<eos> Nothing.<eos> She was assaulted two nights ago.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> She tell you that?<eos> No, a doctor did.
Go ahead.<eos> Push the button.<eos> I'm good.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> You want some red stuff that reminds you of wine?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yep, I do.
Mitchell, when somebody tells me something, I can't wait to get home and tell you.<eos> Don't you feel the same?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> But he -- he made me promise.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> We don't have to share secrets.<eos> We don't.<eos> We already share a house, a life, a daughter.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't --
Go ahead.<eos> Push the button.<eos> I'm good.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> You want some red stuff that reminds you of wine?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yep, I do.
Friend or foe.<eos> But being exposed?<eos> Yes, it does scare me.<eos> Especially now everything has changed.<eos> Vincent?<eos> You have a lot of nerve coming here.<eos> Tori, I didn't come here to fight.<eos> How could you shoot him?<eos> I thought you loved him.<eos> I did.
Gotta keep that refrigerated.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> Are you trying to lose your job?<eos> This from my fellow body snatcher?<eos> No, I was trying to save Vincent, apparently because Cat shot him.<eos> He didn't give her much of a choice.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do, and so do you.
Yeah, people get pissed about getting their identities stolen, but normally, they report it to the police.<eos> Well, maybe he stole from the kind of people that don't report to the police.<eos> Hey!<eos> Look who's back from paternity leave.<eos> So how's Sarah Grace?<eos> I tell you, she is just... my perfect little angel.<eos> - Oh, she's so cute.<eos> Wow. - Yeah.<eos> Is it me or... or does she... look a lot like Esposito?<eos> Yeah, she does.
!<eos> - Or kilos, or whatever.<eos> - You put 50 kilos of cocaine on this bus<eos> - without my permission?<eos> ! Sterling? !<eos> - The what?<eos> - Oh, for...<eos> You dated - Burt Reynolds!<eos> - They don't have the coke, lickbag!<eos> - We do!
Hang on. Shut up.<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> Let's go! Not without a bunch of garlic and some wooden stakes.<eos> What? They're clones, not vampires!<eos> It doesn't matter to the stake!<eos> What're you...<eos> We can't kill them! Well, not now! We wait till morning and then murder them in their coffins.<eos> Cyril?<eos> Thoughts? I just really wish I hadn't come on this stupid trip.<eos> But since I did...
I'm a president, like your Jorge Washington.<eos> Jorge Washington, which apparently<eos> I've been mispronouncing wrong this whole time, wasn't president for life!<eos> He could have been if he wanted.<eos> The 22nd amendment to your constitution imposed the presidential term limits.<eos> But it wasn't passed by your congress until 1947, and not ratified by the requisite number of American states until 1951.<eos> So...<eos> Who are you, Dave Frishberg?<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Of course you don't.
Jesus! And you, sir, will keep a civil tongue in your head when you are addressing the first lady of the government-in-exile of La República de San Marcos.<eos> And also country music.<eos> I facetiously beg milady's pardon.<eos> Oh! Milady facetiously grants it.<eos> Oh, goody.<eos> Now let's steal a car, go join the rebels, then come back here and crush Cyril's stupid army.<eos> You make it sound so easy.<eos> Well, it's Cyril.<eos> Unless he's got a nuclear warhead in his pants...<eos> Which he totally does.
I know it.<eos> Can you deliver there?<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Anna?<eos> Mary, what are you doing out here at this hour?<eos> Looking for you. Oh.<eos> I know what you've been doing.<eos> It's time we talked, don't you think?<eos> Did you know that Abraham's brother Thomas and I were originally supposed to be married?<eos> Yes, I did.
The nomadic years"?<eos> Oh, yes, that was a period of my life when I didn't take a traditional job.<eos> I was just exploring life.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Exploring life. Yeah.<eos> You can't put that on a resume.<eos> Why not?<eos> I live my life with complete honesty.<eos> - I have nothing to hide.<eos> - You really do.
I can't believe you got divorced without telling us.<eos> This is my mom and dad all over again.<eos> Barney, if you start brewing your own beer now and nail my prom date, so help me...<eos> Years too late on one of those, Teddy.<eos> Guys, it's okay.<eos> This isn't a failed marriage.<eos> It's a very successful marriage that happened to only last three years.<eos> You both want this?<eos> For real?<eos> We do.
Let's look at the facts here.<eos> You made us sit down and listen to this story about how you met mom, Yet mom's hardly in the story.<eos> No.<eos> This is a story about how You're totally in love with aunt robin.<eos> And you're thinking about asking her out, And you want to know if we're okay with it.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I kept this story short and to the point, And you guys still missed it.<eos> The point of the story is that...<eos> Is that you totally, totally, totally have the hots for aunt robin.<eos> No, I don't.
The cat penis you can't see, you know, till it's too late.<eos> That's very educational, Lauren.<eos> You... maybe you could take Mr. Princess somewhere else?<eos> How could you resist this little fur-ball?<eos> Hi, big guy.<eos> I'm not much of a cat person.<eos> You know, you look into a dog's eyes, and you can see its soul, and you look into a cat's eyes, and you see a soul thants wto kill you in your sleep.<eos> But there would be no cuter way to go.<eos> Do you want to rip my throat out?<eos> Yes, you do.

Oh.
Go ahead, though, if you have something to say.<eos> It's just-- I-I mean, I may not see you before I-- what--what's left?<eos> [Melancholy song]<eos> - maybe he didn't see you guys.<eos> - No, he saw us.<eos> I said, "hey, Micah."<eos> I could see him seeing us out of the corner of his eye.<eos> He just kept on rolling.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> It just doesn't.
I've been doing this for a long time.<eos> I'm just wondering how you are in the same circle--that's all.<eos> I mean, I'm happy for you.<eos> I just don't know how you got in there.<eos> Carl, who you met the other night, was my friend who- tux guy?<eos> Mr. tux?<eos> - Mr. tux.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, all right, now I get it.<eos> Oh, do you?
Sorry.<eos> And you don't know how to fluff a pillow.<eos> Oh, go fluff yourself.<eos> Sure.<eos> Abandon me.<eos> - That's how this all started.<eos> - Come again?<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - No, you-you seriously think I'm the reason you're a control freak?<eos> - You seriously don't?
Guys. - No, no, no, we...<eos> No, no, hold on.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen.<eos> The great Houdini will escape from this trunk, confined by these handcuffs.<eos> Yeah.<eos> His handcuffs.<eos> Fake.<eos> That's right.<eos> Well, if I had a pair of cuffs from these premises, I would happily...<eos> Now you do.
Well, that was the only wish I was ready for.<eos> And now, grand duchess Anastasia, will you take one out and hand it to me?<eos> So then I said to her,<eos> "I just realized I can't read Russian."<eos> Uh, would your majesty mind translating for me?<eos> It was snowing so hard I was worried Jim wouldn't be able to see the rope.<eos> Pull the rope.<eos> Pull it.<eos> They were convinced I had spiritual powers.<eos> And do you?
You're still here.<eos> Yeah, I told the chief I'd hang out and help out a little bit.<eos> Great. Hey, you got any aspirin?<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Are you feeling the...<eos> It's the headache.<eos> People get them all the time.<eos> Right. Yeah.<eos> - Um, I actually do in my purse.
Now, get that pillow under his head.<eos> Ready, push it now.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, let's get you some air, sir.<eos> Some people need help, even when they don't realize it.<eos> Uh, not so fast, Christopher.<eos> This just in from headquarters for you.<eos> For me?<eos> Says "Christopher Herrmann" on the front, doesn't it?<eos> That it does.
Cruz, you drive Truck. It's an important job.<eos> - I can do both.<eos> - Not necessary.<eos> Jones graduated at the top of her academy class.<eos> I'm sure she can figure out a little basic home ec.<eos> Am I gonna be judged for my efforts on the job or behind the stove?<eos> It's all part of the job, Jones.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jones, when you're finished up in here, the showers need cleaning.<eos> No, they don't.

Hey, man, grab me one!<eos> Mmm, no, grab me two!<eos> I want to make an ice cream sandwich sandwich.<eos> That is an awesome idea.<eos> Are you staring at me or am I just really paranoid?<eos> There's nothing to be paranoid about.<eos> She's on to us. Abort.<eos> I repeat, abort.<eos> I hate you.<eos> You don't.
There ain't no gold in this camp.<eos> The only thing you're gonna pull out of this camp is shit, and you're welcome to that. We ain't gaming no more, friend.<eos> Where... is... it?<eos> You may be stupid, but you're smart enough to know gold ain't worth dying for.<eos> Well, by that logic, it ain't worth killing for, either, now, is it? Enter. Thank you.<eos> The hell's going on?<eos> Something you got no part of.<eos> Go on.<eos> You got that killing look.<eos> Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
And she'll pull the animal right out of you Even if you don't know it's in there.<eos> Nature can't take what you don't want it to.<eos> Goddamn if civilization ain't a beautiful thing.<eos> If you say a word of this to anyone, I'll deny it.<eos> One hangover, I'm used to.<eos> Two hangovers, a whole other thing.<eos> A lot of intoxication in there, last night,<eos> In more ways than one.<eos> It'll wear off.<eos> Always does.
The Amazing Jimmy Pesto Junior and his assistant, Tammy Larson!<eos> That's not my music.<eos> Just go with it.<eos> I can't dance to this!<eos> Damn it!<eos> It looks like he's having a funky stroke.<eos> I miss you, Grandpa!<eos> This doesn't bother me at all, watching my almost boyfriend get horribly humiliated...<eos> Ah!<eos> Yes, it does!
Her men are her business, but just don't introduce him.<eos> Silvia's irredeemable, she took this twerp!<eos> You don't like him at all?<eos> You do?<eos> - Not a bit!<eos> - He's homophobic.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> - And a racist.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
First no answer, then it's off.<eos> - You don't know where she went? - No.<eos> - You really like this place?<eos> - Why not?<eos> Look!<eos> I'm an idiot for asking her to be in the project!<eos> Darling, absolutely no way.<eos> It's shitty, got bad energy, I don't like it.<eos> - I do.<eos> - You do?
And have someone block the door.<eos> Redirect traffic to the women's room upstairs.<eos> - Please wake up.<eos> - What did she take?<eos> Sweetheart, listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> What did she take?<eos> Blow.<eos> Coke.<eos> But she only did two lines.
I'm trying to find the dealer that sold that girl the bad shit that almost killed her, so we can turn him over to the cops.<eos> So now you're a snitch?<eos> That's what you take from all that?<eos> - Daddy.<eos> - It's okay, baby. It's okay.<eos> I got a business to run...<eos> we keep the cops happy, which keeps 'em off our backs, that's it.<eos> As long as I've known you, you ain't never been worried about keeping no cops happy.<eos> You want to do this right now?<eos> Nah, I don't.
Why?<eos> See, that's fine.<eos> That's your choice.<eos> But I just think I could help.<eos> And if I can't... I mean, I know technically I'm not a member of your family.<eos> I just think you'd be better off without me around, always asking questions and bugging you and just wanting to be included. Um...<eos> It's such a shame that you'll be leaving us, Emma.<eos> You've been such a big help.<eos> I understand.<eos> You... you do?
No, no, no.<eos> She's trying to help me.<eos> She's trying to seduce you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Norman.<eos> Norman.<eos> Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because.<eos> Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> - She does not.
You're just torturing yourself 'cause you couldn't find Allie Scott and now you think it's happening again.<eos> I'm doing my job, okay?<eos> My son was in the hospital before.<eos> We didn't know if he was gonna make it.<eos> Something like that happens... there's nothing else in the world that feels that way.<eos> It's like your heart is being ripped out of your chest.<eos> Nothing makes sense.<eos> That's what Joseph Scott feels like every day.<eos> And you don't want the Wallaces to end up the same.<eos> No, I don't.
What about it?<eos> What if it wasn't like that?<eos> What if we told her?<eos> Told her what?<eos> About us?<eos> Jack.<eos> Uh, the other day was lovely.<eos> But I think we should just leave it at that.<eos> And what if I wanted more than that?<eos> You don't.
Thank you.<eos> This was delicious.<eos> Yeah, I remember how much you loved this restaurant.<eos> I do.<eos> But we used to only come here when it was a special occasions.<eos> Well, I was hoping that... tonight could maybe be one of those.<eos> Right.<eos> The Nicky question. Uh-huh. You really think we should be telling her about... whatever it is we've been doing?<eos> Only if we want to keep doing it.<eos> And you do?

Um, do you mind turning that off?<eos> I know the type.<eos> ♪ Hey ya. Super friendly.<eos> Pretty.<eos> She was beautiful.<eos> Right.<eos> "Beautiful."<eos> And she had a great body.<eos> I saw the pictures.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Here's a little gift for you for believing in me. - Oh.<eos> - It's a gel-based hair serum.<eos> Enough with the mousse, for real.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, Ron, you were right.<eos> Tom has really grown up.<eos> You seem merely overjoyed instead of irritatingly ecstatic. - Why?<eos> - Well, Tom's come into his own. April runs Animal Control.<eos> I mean, does this department even need me anymore? No.<eos> We do not.
See?<eos> Desmond's fine.<eos> I guess this shouldn't come as a shock that you have addictive behavior.<eos> You are my daughter.<eos> I'm not addicted to a video game.<eos> No, honey, I think you're addicted to winning.<eos> Wow, this is all my fault.<eos> I created an expectation in you.<eos> When you were little, I always let you win at everything.<eos> No, you didn't.
- Are you busy?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> Just answering e-mails while "friendscaping" on my phone and toning my thighs with a squeeze ball.<eos> [ Squeaking ] What can I do for you?<eos> Um, I just wanted to make sure we were okay.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Oh, well, we were starting to become friend... ly...ish.<eos> And I'm beginning to sense some tension, and I think it might be because of what happened between you and Richard.<eos> Oh, Kimmie, if you're asking if I blame you for what happened between me and Richard, well, the answer is yes.<eos> - Oh. - I do.
And got away with it.<eos> I'm not going to let it happen again.<eos> You're saying... Victor McKinley might have killed both of them?<eos> Victor was struck off for mis-prescribing strong sedatives, and all indications are that Mrs. McKinley was drugged or Carter and her daughter would've heard her being abducted.<eos> She could have left the house of her own accord.<eos> No, she couldn't.<eos> Not alone, anyway.<eos> The only other exit is by the windows.<eos> But there's only two sets of keys, and Charlotte didn't have either of them.<eos> Who did?
They think he's responsible for Elspeth's disappearance.<eos> Seth Wake was her lover, that much he admits.<eos> He says they were planning to run away together.<eos> He waited outside, she didn't turn up.<eos> He can't have done it.<eos> The supposition is that Elspeth changed her mind, told him she wasn't coming, they argued, he killed her.<eos> I don't believe he did anything to Elspeth.<eos> But I know he didn't do anything to Charlotte.<eos> He doesn't have an alibi.<eos> Yes, he does.
Mrs. McCarthy speaking.<eos> Mrs. McCarthy, tell the Father, I'm bringing charges for wasting police time.<eos> But, sir!<eos> Victor McKinley's upstairs.<eos> Out cold. Looks like suicide.<eos> Why can't they hear us?<eos> This place was built to be soundproof.<eos> The priests hiding down here were only safe if they couldn't be heard.<eos> -And how did they get out?<eos> -They didn't!
It's barely visible now.<eos> They got it here, right here.<eos> Jealous, huh?<eos> I still feel it in my head when you do that.<eos> - No?<eos> - I swear.<eos> The bullet stayed in too long.<eos> - You believed me.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> You did too!
OK, right, come out.<eos> Come out!<eos> You should've died, not him.<eos> So you're going to die.<eos> And your mum is.<eos> And so is your dad.<eos> You'll all be dead.<eos> - I don't have a dad.<eos> - Liar!<eos> Well, I probably do but...
- He's 7 years old.<eos> It'll kill his father. - I... (sighs)<eos> Could you go in from the back?<eos> Uh... I can't access the tumor that way,<eos> - but I...<eos> - But what?<eos> SATs and pressure are lousy.<eos> He's fluid overloaded.<eos> (Alex) Well, we've got a plan.<eos> Charlie does.
- You got the pathology report? Mm-hmm. Nottingham...<eos> So Nottingham 7 is a high score.<eos> Considering the Nottingham scale only goes to 9, I'd say so.<eos> Why wasn't this picked up in earlier mammograms?<eos> Um, she hadn't had one in a few years.<eos> (scoffs) Wow, this woman is in serious denial.<eos> Why is that?<eos> A 2.5 centimeter tumor in the lower pole?<eos> If she takes a bath or puts on a bra, she would have felt it.<eos> Perhaps she did.
This morning she called me "Jasper."<eos> That's her dog's name.<eos> How about when you're done here, you swing by the hospital.<eos> Let me, uh... give you the once-over?<eos> - Okay. - Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Danny... take a picture of us. (camera shutter clicking)<eos> Okay, here's what's gonna happen.<eos> But you don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> No one does.
That's only 'cause I got burned on the last miracle implant.<eos> (drawer clatters) How about a drink?<eos> Um... (sighs) I really have to take this to pathology.<eos> Actually, that's going with me.<eos> What do you mean, it's going with you?<eos> You know the terms of our clinical trial...<eos> Any implant removed from participants becomes the sole property of Sabian Medical Devices.<eos> What, is that the only reason that you wanted to conduct the autopsy... just to get your prosthesis?<eos> (sighs) If there is a design flaw here, I want to know about it, and I want to get it fixed.<eos> - Yeah, we all do. - (chuckles) Okay.
The baby will stay in a sling, and I'll breast feed on demand.<eos> Not even gonna respond to that.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Well, we'll figure something out.<eos> - Is that decaf?<eos> - No, it's coffee.<eos> You could at least try it.<eos> - Or at least half-caf.<eos> It tastes the same.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
At ease. Ugh! Does sleeping in the nude give you a cold?<eos> Mm, not that alone, no.<eos> I'm seeing this guy, and he's really into sleeping all night with nothing on.<eos> Enjoy your nudity, fella.<eos> I'm just gonna freeze over here.<eos> I guess I just like him, though.<eos> Yeah, that's how it all starts.<eos> - Yeah... But I do like him. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> We all do.
Bone?<eos> I know it's a lot to take in, but, um... Yeah, we call it, um, biological shrapnel.<eos> It's not my bone.<eos> No, it's someone else's.<eos> And...<eos> You put it back on my spine?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> We used it to, um... strengthen the hardware affixing your spinal fracture by turning the bone into a paste, like a cement.<eos> I think I know what it is you're going through.<eos> You do, huh?
I miss you.<eos> I am not okay without you.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Then why are we doing this?<eos> Because I don't want to drag you through any more of my crap.<eos> Well, I am not giving up on us.<eos> We're meant to be together.<eos> I know it.<eos> And... I think you know it, too.<eos> I do.
Partnership over.<eos> It was fucking magnificent.<eos> Yeah, that sounds great.<eos> Are you fucking serious?<eos> Stop. That's all you have to say to me? "It sounds great"?<eos> Yeah. Are you nuts, dude?<eos> Haven't you worked for her before?<eos> I never had a problem with Monica.<eos> Of course you didn't have a problem with Monica.<eos> I didn't.
No, I didn't know.<eos> When and where did you last see her?<eos> She quit school before graduation. I don't remember why. I haven't seen her since.<eos> She dated an older guy...<eos> Stop!<eos> Can't you see you're in the Escarfail case again?<eos> And now Bénady?<eos> 2 murders!<eos> I don't give a damn if she dated an older guy, unless it relates to Pascale or Elsa!<eos> Does it or not?

You know, I would watch that again maybe over dinner.<eos> Wow, that's... forward.<eos> Oh! Not you boy.<eos> Oh, you know, I shouldn't have asked.<eos> No, I'm... I'm very glad you did.<eos> Except he had 37 hours left on that stupid deal he made with his son.<eos> Do you have plans tonight?<eos> I don't. How about Monday?<eos> Mel, if you don't want to go out with me, it's fine.<eos> I really do.
I knew it.<eos> Sex club.<eos> - I'll wear my crotchless teddy.<eos> - Uh, cocktail attire.<eos> Wear something warm in case we want to hang outside.<eos> Ah, I've never been to an outdoor sex club.<eos> Oh, yeah, you know what?<eos> Speaking of romantic, intimate getaways-- my mom. Ew.<eos> She wanted us to come grill tonight.<eos> - She did? - Mm-hmm.
Hey, I pay 30 at the Thai place, and they wash towels too.<eos> Damn Thai sex workers, stealing jobs from decent Americans.<eos> Our girls are Russian.<eos> They eat with forks, not with sticks, right?<eos> Baby, you hit up everyone who's come in here, all three of 'em.<eos> What if we advertise?<eos> Put an ad in Craigslist or one of those free local business things?<eos> Hey, yeah, we can get some meth heads to hand out flyers and shit.<eos> - And pay them how?<eos> - We don't.
I'm thinking of growing a beard.<eos> I read in the paper that we've reached peak beard, but I'm not so sure.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Ask me what "peak beard" is.<eos> Oh, your curiosity has made you mute.<eos> All right, I'll tell you.<eos> Peak beard is the point where so many men have beards that we wish no one did.<eos> Yeah, that's where we are.<eos> Did you know that I'm half-Armenian?<eos> No, I did not.
Yeah, I know, and it's weird!<eos> I'm a little weird.<eos> What's up, man? Up top.<eos> A lot can happen in one night.<eos> Sometimes you meet someone great.<eos> Sometimes you get your heart broken.<eos> Sometimes nothing changes at all.<eos> But sometimes...<eos> Just sometimes...<eos> Everything does. - Pono? !
Hi.<eos> I really didn't think I'd see you again.<eos> I have to get something off my chest.<eos> Okay.<eos> I am in a lot of pain.<eos> I know.<eos> You may know, but s... sometimes I suspect that you think... I'm this uncooperative old bitch... who's just making all of this up.<eos> Do you want to get better?<eos> Really? No bullshit. Do you want to?<eos> I do.
Glad that I have triple 9<eos> How about triple 7<eos> Triple 7 can't do<eos> Triple 3 can<eos> You need one more<eos> Bomb, stupid!<eos> I guess I bombed too, with Four Kings<eos> Can I fold?<eos> Do you have any?<eos> No, I don't
Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Hey!<eos> Stop!<eos> Police!<eos> You were here last night, weren't you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Yes.<eos> Bet you got some terrific photographs.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I did.
Right. What's happened, exactly?<eos> Lucien!<eos> It's the superintendent.<eos> Tell him I'll call him back.<eos> You might want to speak with him.<eos> They've just brought in a young girl.<eos> Just bear with me.<eos> I love him!<eos> Shirley...<eos> But I do!
He was poisoned.<eos> Poisoned? Mm.<eos> With what?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> You won't catch me walking around there.<eos> Not with that man creeping about.<eos> Jean.<eos> Well, Mattie, he is a menace.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Oh, yes we do.
Corn Flakes, every day.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I did his shopping.<eos> Right. And what about his dinner?<eos> I'd organise an extra sandwich.<eos> And he liked his toast.<eos> He liked his toast.<eos> If you don't mind me saying, that seems like intimate knowledge for a secretary.<eos> Do you have a housekeeper, Doctor?<eos> Yes, I do.
It's true what they say, isn't it?<eos> Best not to look down.<eos> Do you know what?<eos> I think I'd better sit down.<eos> Why don't you have a seat with me, eh?<eos> I'd appreciate it.<eos> Please.<eos> I knew Joseph was going to get away with it.<eos> No-one ever believes you.<eos> I do.
I understand you worked in the tuckshop?<eos> We all did.<eos> Donald McEvoy as well?<eos> She was in a relationship with Mr Lennox.<eos> What about his breakfast and dinner?<eos> He ate his breakfast at home.<eos> Cornflakes, every day.<eos> That seems like intimate knowledge for a secretary.<eos> Do you have a housekeeper, Doctor?<eos> Yes, I do.
Only a fool would say anything uncharitable about your mother.<eos> As long as your meal is on the table, you don't have to worry.<eos> I hate this town.<eos> Jack, listen.<eos> None of that is important now.<eos> You're going to be a father soon.<eos> Don't waste that.<eos> Does Mum know?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she does.
None of that is important now.<eos> You're going to be a father soon.<eos> Don't waste that.<eos> Does Mum know?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> Come stay with us.<eos> Come stay with us and look after that little one of yours.<eos> Jean wants you here.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Stop.<eos> It's not too late for us, Walter.<eos> -We can still leave together. -No!<eos> Just...<eos> don't.<eos> Walter, why don't you give me the gun?<eos> -You never loved me.<eos> -Ah, the penny drops!<eos> -It was all an act. -Of course I loved you.<eos> I still do.
I didn't know.<eos> Oh, Ben...<eos> You said you only slept with her once.<eos> Once.<eos> It was... five years...<eos> Five years ago.<eos> I can do the maths.<eos> When, exactly?<eos> You didn't want to know.<eos> Now I do.
- Why would he do that?<eos> I don't know what or who to believe anymore. And frankly, I am tired of feeling that way.<eos> Okay. He was with you. But you know what?<eos> He has done a lot of bad things in his life, and if this isn't one of them, well, at least he's where he belongs.<eos> Drew!<eos> I have a confession from a guy and a pattern of facts to support it!<eos> If he concocted it, then he's probably hiding something worse.<eos> - That's just not true.<eos> - You don't know that!<eos> - I do!
Has everyone heard the news?<eos> DI Farrow claims to have discovered the bodies of his wife and son.<eos> Abi!<eos> I've been promoted to lead the investigation.<eos> You are joking.<eos> We have your fingerprints on the knife that killed Abi.<eos> Why don't you just tell me what happened?<eos> I didn't do it!<eos> You think you have to charge him?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
Yeah, but there were no disks at Abi's house, or at his flat - just an old computer, but nothing on the hard drive.<eos> No CD. He didn't get a chance to do it, then.<eos> Then they're missing, these disks.<eos> What's it matter to you?<eos> Cos they're about Hassan!<eos> Farrow's investigating Hassan!<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Come on, Sean, you met Farrow.<eos> He told you what he was doing.<eos> No, he didn't.
So is Marcus.<eos> They both are.<eos> You... Fuck!<eos> Fucking... why couldn't you trust me?<eos> Does he?<eos> No.<eos> You just piss off.<eos> You sanctimonious shit.<eos> Does he know what you did?<eos> Does he?
Get your boss or we will.<eos> Come out.<eos> The Expendables are here.<eos> - What?<eos> - I said to come out!<eos> What the hell?<eos> I'm doing my books.<eos> It's about my son.<eos> - Don't know him.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- I... honest.<eos> - Sure, you didn't.<eos> I'll never say a word, sir.<eos> I swear to you.<eos> I...<eos> I got children.<eos> We can't take any chances.<eos> No, no, no. Accountants always keep their word, don't they?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> We sure do, accountants.
Police records, financial checks?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good, excellent.<eos> Er, you can fill me in later.<eos> Right.<eos> I think it's time we spoke to Richard's old chums, don't you?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Am I seeing things or did he fall out of the window?<eos> Um... yes.<eos> Yes, he did.
Yes, we are.<eos> We understand that you were thrown out of university for cheating on your exams.<eos> It's a matter of public record.<eos> Why bring it up now?<eos> You didn't think to tell us?<eos> I hardly see how it's relevant!<eos> It's relevant because it was Richard who reported you, wasn't it?<eos> Is that true?<eos> You really expect us to believe you didn't know?<eos> Well, I didn't.
Julian Assange, Hammond, Snowden, they are the prophets of our time.<eos> They are the voices that are crying out in the wilderness.<eos> And they are the ones that the State intends to murder.<eos> We have no democracy any more. We can't say what's on our mind.<eos> This very interview is enough to land me in jail with no trial.<eos> Forever.<eos> They'll throw me in Guantanamo.<eos> It's not our voice any more.<eos> Well, don't you feel you could change that?<eos> No, I don't.
Two nine-year-olds on corner lookout, arguing about who's cooler, kid or play?<eos> - Oh, come on, it's play.<eos> - Of course it is!<eos> I mean, how is that even an argument?<eos> That's not an argument!<eos> Kid gets no pussy, and keeps getting beat up!<eos> - Get his ass beat, right?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Lukas and I, we made sense once.<eos> We did.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> How did it go last night with your latest fling?<eos> Oh, it's over.<eos> She brought up horoscopes.<eos> You're unbelievable.<eos> She just took you on a weekend trip to wine country for your birthday.<eos> I know, and then, she brought up horoscopes.<eos> You don't have a caring bone in your body.<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't really get it.<eos> To me, he just looks like an idiot playing records.<eos> But I'm sure I did dumber things when I was his age.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, like... none of your business.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's okay.<eos> And listen, if you ever get a car from this century, you know where to find me.<eos> - I do.
I didn't finish!<eos> Pagoda!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> This won't take but a sec.<eos> Here, Dotty.<eos> Hold that till it dries.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Rough morning. Won't happen again.<eos> But it did.
Face it-- you don't have a leg to stand on.<eos> Oh, I got legs-- two of them, just like Axl-- that might have been perfect for ice skating, only we'll never know 'cause you took Sue to ice capades.<eos> Hey, I still do stuff with Axl.<eos> When is the last time you did anything like that with Sue?<eos> Hey, I spend time with Sue.<eos> I watched her play volleyball, Frankie.<eos> Got her checked out at the emergency room.<eos> I'm just saying, you don't know where she works.<eos> You have no idea what J-P-la is.<eos> Nobody does.
Well, I prefer spontaneous.<eos> We're not gonna be gone too long, right?<eos> I mean, we got school.<eos> Well, you and your brother are both exceptional students.<eos> So you'll catch up, or you'll go back to homeschooling.<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> It's my senior year, dad.<eos> I have homecoming and and friends and...<eos> I have a life.<eos> You certainly do, with me and your brother, right here on this R.V.
I'm sorry about the drink.<eos> I was just...<eos> Taking the foot off the gas, so to speak.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Good.<eos> Are we done?<eos> You want to tell me what's going on with you?<eos> Nothing is going on with me.<eos> You really want to turn the whole ship around?<eos> - Yes. I do.
Trick-or-treat for UNICEF?<eos> He's my son.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, where's mom?<eos> It's just me and the boy.<eos> What about that girl?<eos> She was driving the RV, remember?<eos> Seth.<eos> You two like to play dress-up?<eos> No, we do not.
- Dad, this is bullshit!<eos> - I know how you feel!<eos> You want to protect the family, but this isn't the way!<eos> They're bullies and they're assholes and they don't deserve to win!<eos> As soon as we get across that border, they're gonna bury us in the desert!<eos> And I know you think I can't do it.<eos> - But I can.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Now, I know that you thought you could.<eos> I do.
Yes.<eos> But she's gone now.<eos> You're lying.<eos> And if you don't tell me the truth, I will arrest you for obstruction<eos> - and harboring a fugitive...<eos> - Stop.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> He's just trying to protect me.<eos> She even kind of looks like Carrie.<eos> No, she does not!
We're gonna have to kick her loose.<eos> Waitress confirmed that Jordan was at the café in Queens till 11:00.<eos> So she couldn't have killed Madison.<eos> Not with her bare hands, but who knows how far her secret telekinetic powers might reach?<eos> Well, it turns out our victim might've had some secrets of her own.<eos> Did you track down whoever Madison was seeing?<eos> As far as I can tell, she wasn't seeing anybody.<eos> But these are her financials.<eos> - What kind of high-school kid has financials?<eos> - Madison does.
'My Dream?<eos> ' I'm a different character at school, so I don't know what to write.<eos> What kind of character?<eos> I'm always smiling and agreeing on everything.<eos> I pretend like I'm a little bit dumb too.<eos> What kind of dream would a girl like that have?<eos> I'm serious.<eos> No, I was thinking it must be a lot of work for you.<eos> It's exhausting, you know?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Here?<eos> Bear it.<eos> Bear it.<eos> I feel pathetic.<eos> Ouch.<eos> Welcome.<eos> - How many people?<eos> - Two.<eos> - Do you smoke?<eos> - No, we don't.
But I told you...<eos> - I told you I...<eos> - Broke it off?<eos> But that isn't true, is it?<eos> I also know that you were planning on divorcing Gavin, that you were filing papers.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> I wasn't gonna go through with it.<eos> Well, all the jury will see is discord within the marriage, that Gavin had a motive to kill Walt.<eos> But I do have one other way that I can defend Gavin.<eos> You do?
Hello.<eos> I'm here for lunch.<eos> Oh, what long faces.<eos> Who wants a butterscotch?<eos> Ooh, I do.<eos> Mom, you're a little early.<eos> We're in the middle of a meeting.<eos> No, we're done. [Snaps]<eos> Do you have anything in there to mask the stink of failure?<eos> Yes, I do.
No?<eos> Is it... is that weird?<eos> Toby: You need to get a 90 on your physics exam to get off academic probation.<eos> A 90?<eos> In physics?<eos> By tomorrow?<eos> It's our only shot at keeping you on the team.<eos> I could maybe get a 75.<eos> If I had a week to study.<eos> Well, you don't.
The night of the accident.<eos> I know about the pills.<eos> How?<eos> This place.<eos> It showed me.<eos> That's why you were driving so fast.<eos> You were trying to get her to the hospital so they could pump her stomach.<eos> I didn't want you and Scott to know.<eos> I didn't want you to ever know.<eos> No, of course you didn't.
Great idea, Dad.<eos> We can have people over and order a bunch of Thai.<eos> No, Tina.<eos> I'm talking about our food.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Ugh. What do you want, Jimmy?<eos> Hey, saw your little sign. What are you gonna do, listen to the game on the radio and then go out and tell everybody what happened? Come on.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You don't have a TV!<eos> Yeah, we do.
Now come on, she's humiliated enough.<eos> Give the girl a break.<eos> Fine, I admit it.<eos> I have been a little petty.<eos> I guess all I have left to say is... ♪ I'm calling Michael Voltaggio ♪<eos> Care Bear.<eos> Jujubee.<eos> I'm really, really sorry about all of this.<eos> Well, you have nothing to be sorry about.<eos> Yes, I do.
The detectives would like to ask you some further questions.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Sir, ma'am.<eos> Take a seat, cadet.<eos> How are you feeling, Kyle?<eos> Much better, thank you, ma'am.<eos> Good.<eos> Do you know if anyone was staying in the beach house?<eos> Friend, or guest of the family, maybe?<eos> No, ma'am, I do not.
I did.<eos> It didn't.<eos> He had it disabled.<eos> The last thing he wanted was for someone to be able to track him.<eos> How could I not have known who he was?<eos> I don't know if I can do this.<eos> I'm drowning, Holder.<eos> You have to.<eos> - We got no choice.<eos> - Yeah. We do.
What is going on?<eos> You're not my social worker anymore.<eos> Stay out of my life.<eos> Get your backpack, please, Jack.<eos> You don't have the slightest idea what I'm dealing with.<eos> Every time I've ever opened the door, the only thing I've gotten back from you is that disappointed, shitty look of yours.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You have never known me.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> No one does.
How long is Jack in town?<eos> Until tomorrow night.<eos> Maybe you should go spend some time with him. You know?<eos> Go get a burger or something.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You need to calm the fuck down, Linden.<eos> You can't be running around burning the only bridges we got left.<eos> We're not gonna get through this.<eos> I thought you wanted to solve this case.<eos> I do.
We tried to see if he'd remember and he did.<eos> Lincoln was right all along.<eos> It was just a matter of time before he remembered.<eos> We should've killed him as soon as he came back here.<eos> You need to watch your tone with me, Cadet Fielding.<eos> - Fuck that cadet bullshit.<eos> - Don't talk to her like that.<eos> Why are you defending her?<eos> She doesn't care about us.<eos> She never did.
- And the two of you are... - In a relationship?<eos> We were.<eos> It's over.<eos> It has been for weeks now.<eos> I need you to keep an eye on this place, put a surveillance detail on it...<eos> as a favor to me?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Uh, do you have a safe place to stay for the time being, ma'am?<eos> Yes.<eos> She does.
Well, would it make you happy driving this thing around?<eos> Lots of things would make me happy.<eos> Everybody deserves a little happy.<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> Hey, Teej, what's going on?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, great.<eos> Well, why did I come all the way out here to meet you?<eos> Did you know that dad was in love with a woman before he met mom?<eos> Um... No, I didn't.
You would tell me, right?<eos> You know, I'm glad that you came.<eos> I think... I think was getting a little crazy, so...<eos> Oh, Clark can do that... make a person crazy.<eos> I mean, I love him to death, but, my lord.<eos> Is he like that with you, too?<eos> Oh, he's like that with everybody!<eos> I mean, he's such a great, great guy, but... he's just missing that one little thing.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I do.

Go ahead.<eos> It's just not some dumb job.<eos> You know that.<eos> Probably more than I do.<eos> And if you check "Married," then they'll do a background on Clark.<eos> And he's not allowed to be married to anyone inside the department.<eos> I know.<eos> I suppose it's not like me lying on the form would get me thrown in jail... or anything.<eos> Martha... he loves you so much.<eos> He does, doesn't he? Hmm.

Good night, Agent Beeman.<eos> Good night, sir. Oh. Wow.<eos> Wow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's very, um...<eos> Actually, I hated it.<eos> I don't know anything about classical music.<eos> Well, you certainly picked it.<eos> I mean, you probably thought, you know, "Good old Beethoven,"<eos> Yeah, I did.
This is great.<eos> This is...<eos> Actually, this is exactly the thing that you were...<eos> Are you gonna listen to it right now?<eos> Oh. You want to hear it... take it.<eos> No. I meant I... could listen with you.<eos> With me, like, in the booth?<eos> Not if you don't want me to.<eos> No.<eos> I do.
I...<eos> Believe me.<eos> I've tried everything.<eos> But thank you.<eos> Do you know his name?<eos> Larrick.<eos> Andrew.<eos> I think he's a captain or something.<eos> I know where his files are.<eos> You do?
'Cause after one night, I've changed my mind about this place being safe for me.<eos> Or anyone.<eos> Ever.<eos> No.<eos> No, I think you're wrong.<eos> I really think I should tell them.<eos> They're going to want to know the story.<eos> The whole story.<eos> I really think they should know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Please don't drill a hole in my head.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They told me my lawyer was here.<eos> So either I'm going to congratulate you on recently passing the bar or I should be worried about something.<eos> Hello, Christoph.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I thought this guy had a key to everything.<eos> I do.
Ethan's at the school.<eos> Go.<eos> Oh, I hope he gets there in time.<eos> I like the twins.<eos> Short tempers.<eos> Homicidal compulsions.<eos> They're a lot more fun than you bakemono trying to save the world every day.<eos> Doc, you brought something to paralyze his body.<eos> You got anything for his mouth?<eos> Yes, I do.
In the game of Go, it's what we call a truly inspired, or out-of-the-box move.<eos> The Nogitsune has had sente, the advantage, until this point.<eos> What you need is a divine move in order to turn the game around.<eos> Okay, so is anyone feeling divinely inspired?<eos> Mom, you said you trapped it in a glass jar, right?<eos> It wasn't the jar that trapped it.<eos> It was where I buried it.<eos> The Nemeton.<eos> A place I don't know too much about.<eos> Who does?

- I'm Jacob by the way. - Avery.<eos> - I might call you.<eos> I got this box and inside it was the photo.<eos> And the gun.<eos> Where is it that we're going?<eos> It's a co-op in the mountains up north.<eos> JACOB: I just killed someone.<eos> You know what you're getting yourself into?<eos> AVERY: Do you?
"I want you.<eos> X, X. I wish I could tell everyone about us."<eos> We're in a relationship.<eos> That was easy.<eos> Brilliant. Yeah?<eos> Has that helped?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Really?<eos> Does Ziggy know?<eos> Who does?
Are you telling me there's a convicted child killer living at the bottom of my street?<eos> What do you people do?<eos> Do you keep an eye on these people?<eos> All right.<eos> Finish your cigarette and let's get out of here, OK?<eos> The search teams and cadaver dogs are still at Robbie's property but, I mean, there's no sign of anything at the moment.<eos> Could you get a toddler in that bag?<eos> Does he have any grudge against you or...?<eos> Does he have any grudge against me?<eos> Does he?
Fiona, I'm going to go now and arrange for another appropriate adult to accompany Toby in any further interviews.<eos> Not ideal, I know, to do it in here.<eos> But we're a bit... pushed for space.<eos> It's an absolute nightmare out there.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Not great, erm...<eos> Yeah?<eos> You smoke, don't you, Laurie?<eos> Do I smoke?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Ashtray?<eos> ..under the tap sometimes.<eos> Empty beer can? Yeah.<eos> Where?<eos> Just on the ground sometimes.<eos> It's not against the law, is it?<eos> It probably is.<eos> But, throw them in the gutter...<eos> Whatever.<eos> You gonna do me for littering?
You're trying to convince me I'm not dying.<eos> What kind of friends are you?<eos> Look, Snotlout, maybe you have seen the five signposts what kindto Valhalla. Are you?<eos> And maybe you are going to die someday.<eos> And maybe you could stop scratching your butt while I'm talking to you.<eos> Sorry, it's just all this broadgrass in my shorts.<eos> And your shorts are full of broadgrass why?<eos> More importantly, why aren't yours?<eos> The twins told me it prevents saddle chafing.<eos> Oh, they did, did they?
Now I'm gonna miss another deadline that I promised I'd make.<eos> Well, maybe the stakes are a little bit higher in my world, okay?<eos> I'm not just QA-ing calculators.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I didn't...<eos> Gordon, let me ask you something.<eos> When is the last time you cut their toenails?<eos> Or which one of your daughters is allergic to apricots?<eos> Do you even know their pediatrician's name?<eos> No, you don't?
And yet... it's still better than anything I could write.<eos> I... never was.<eos> No.<eos> - I stop pretending that I'm something I'm not, and I can't go to Venezuela.<eos> I'll only disappoint a new group of people.<eos> So what are you going to do?<eos> Well, I suspect I don't have much time left on this Earth, but whatever time I do have, I know I want it to be better than this.<eos> So you have a plan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I do.
What happens if someone comes through the window with a machete and now you're like, "Wait there, dickhead.<eos> "Oh, yeah.<eos> "You've come to the wrong house here.<eos> "34, 56.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna ruin you, buddy!"<eos> That's good.<eos> Is that your new routine?<eos> It might be. Do you like it?<eos> I think it's...<eos> No, I don't.
Detective Brian Lucas.<eos> I'm afraid I've got some bad news.<eos> Oh, my God, this can't be happening.<eos> I know, it's a shock.<eos> We do have a few questions to ask you, though, okay?<eos> There were, uh, cinder blocks in your car, as well as a coil of rope.<eos> And your trunk was lined with plastic.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> I-I'm sorry, I don't know...<eos> But no, I-I didn't.
I have a daughter.<eos> Her name is Tingting.<eos> This is Zhuo Yihang, Head of Wudang.<eos> These are nice snacks.<eos> Take them to Xiong's man, Yuan Chonghuan, as reward from the Palace.<eos> Master.<eos> Are you going to Liaodong?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know, General Xiong is a patriot?<eos> I do.

So she's on the one o'clock flight?<eos> Erm, well, I don't know exactly...<eos> It's the only flight from London tomorrow.<eos> Is it?<eos> Well, that'll be the one, then.<eos> Yes. Yes.<eos> Yes. Erm...<eos> Camille, the thing is, er, about Sally...<eos> Oh, don't worry, I know.<eos> You do?
And we have to quickly decide on the shop's name -<eos> - Right? How was it?<eos> How was the mood today?<eos> - I don't know how.<eos> We have to order the store sign too. - Meeting after such a long time.<eos> Well, you two were alone, right?<eos> So, like "I've always ... to Souta-kun"?<eos> Eh? !<eos> Did she say that?<eos> No, she didn't.
- I don't know.<eos> No.<eos> We don't breach.<eos> I won't risk that.<eos> Leave them there, start your rounds.<eos> We start at the top.<eos> Work our way down.<eos> And do it again.<eos> When do I get surveillance back in the room where my daughter is?<eos> We don't.
Hurst.<eos> Every day, I saw him.<eos> I know his wife.<eos> I know his little girl, Tory.<eos> - Kyle...<eos> - She's just eight.<eos> But I saw him aim that gun at your dad.<eos> I saw him shoot Finley.<eos> - I saw it, too.<eos> We all did.
If you're just joining us, another Ballard student,<eos> Emma Vries, has been released.<eos> She's the eighth student since the kidnapping to be released.<eos> The FBI has now confirmed that the woman found hanging - beneath the 15th Street bridge...<eos> - The Fitch girl?<eos> She'll have a story to tell.<eos> - Unharmed?<eos> - Not a scratch.<eos> - You know how important she is.<eos> - I do.
Just as soon as you hear my idea.<eos> As you know, Shelby is selling Fancie's and I intend on buying it.<eos> But I face two minor hurdles.<eos> One... you don't have the money.<eos> And two...<eos> Shelby won't sell you Fancie's 'cause your dad tried to sabotage her cabaret.<eos> 15 years.<eos> Goes a lot deeper than nooks and crannies.<eos> That's why I know what you're gonna say next.<eos> No, you don't.
Actually, the very fact that you think this would be offensive to me is offensive.<eos> You're the one being racist.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not the one who called you a Mexican.<eos> "Called me a Mexican"?<eos> You're doing it again.<eos> I'm bending over backwards to not be racist right now.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, what did he say when you told him I wasn't Mexican?<eos> - I didn't.
Nothing... Uh... I mean, it's...<eos> Agent Jinks, it's your go, I believe.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Can I maybe go later, or you know, not at all?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Don't go all Pete on me.<eos> We each have to do this.<eos> No, I'm not, it's just...<eos> What if I don't have a defining Warehouse moment?<eos> Of course you do, Pookie.

I love you too. Wow.<eos> Listen, before we... Uh, move in any sort of direction,<eos> - I need you to do something.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Do not say the Time Capsule.<eos> - The Time Capsule!<eos> Come on.<eos> You said it.<eos> You said it.<eos> Yes, I did.
I'm not sleepy.<eos> The sun's out.<eos> Well, give it a shot.<eos> Nap time.<eos> I'm too old for naps, Tate.<eos> You're bad at tuck-ins.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why do you have to hurt people?<eos> - Well, sometimes you have to.<eos> - No, you don't.
Why do you have to hurt people?<eos> - Well, sometimes you have to.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Well, he lied to me.<eos> He deserved it.<eos> You know that's not the truth.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> And you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
If I'd understood, I never would have said...<eos> Well, great.<eos> Naomi's walking out on Jimmy, and now you're walking out on me.<eos> - It's freakin' kismet.<eos> - Listen to me!<eos> I'm not walking out on you.<eos> But we can't get married just because you're screwed up about your dad.<eos> Don't use him as an excuse for cold feet.<eos> If you don't want to get married, just say so.<eos> I don't!
What is going on?<eos> - Get off of me, Mer.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Get off me.<eos> Alex, please. Please.<eos> I thought if I... came back, kept my head down, did the work, I might be able to... not fix it, but start to make up for what I did to Karev's dad. I don't deserve to feel better.<eos> I deserved this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You really did.
The Doctor's the one that speaks dinosaur.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am, the wife doesn't like to be kept waiting.<eos> Where did he get that face?<eos> Why's it got lines on it?<eos> It's brand-new.<eos> How can his hair be all grey?<eos> He only just got it.<eos> It's still him, ma'am, you saw him change.<eos> I know.<eos> I do, I...
My daughter been in to see me?<eos> No, but the deputies have already been to her house looking for your money.<eos> I think you've put her through enough.<eos> I want to talk to her.<eos> I would love to accommodate you, Mr. Richards.<eos> Give me a reason to.<eos> I'm not the only one the FBI will be interested in.<eos> If they take me, they take Jacob Langston, too.<eos> Do you really think that I care what happens to that little freak of nature?<eos> Maybe not... but he does.
I made a promise.<eos> About Tate?<eos> To whom?<eos> I made a promise.<eos> Hope you painted the room pink.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> She's gonna be like me.<eos> Like my mother.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - No, I do.
Okay, thank you very much, sir.<eos> No, wait, wait, wait, I got a sandwich coming.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Gorgonzola and pear.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. Ah...<eos> All right, so we know that Barb wasn't at the diner on Monday.<eos> Yeah, she was there, though, today.<eos> Didn't Dean say that she was running late for something?<eos> Yeah, he did.
It's been the two of us ever since.<eos> Sometimes I think about leaving.<eos> Well, you could, you know.<eos> Go someplace better.<eos> And, uh... is that where you went?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is this better?<eos> I had to remove the jawbone in order to get the dental impression, but this is definitely Barb Birk.<eos> I was hoping you'd have more for me.<eos> Oh, I do.
Yeah, that's me.<eos> Nancy. What?<eos> I just wanted you to know that I got you that dress you liked.<eos> Well, I don't want ii anymore.<eos> What happened?<eos> I thought you loved it.<eos> You can't just buy me things.<eos> Grace, where is this coming from?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course you don't.
I'm glad I'm not the only one.<eos> What have you been doing?<eos> Well, I mean, just taking care of Grandma.<eos> I mean, when she heard I wanted to leave, she had, like, 20,000 errands for me to run, and suddenly she couldn't live without her heart medicine, which is so weird, so...<eos> Surprise, darling.<eos> Heard you went back to BlueBell.<eos> Cut my trip short 'cause I missed my girlfriend. Oh, my. "Girlfriend"?<eos> Carter Covington, we met at, uh...<eos> Oh, I-I remember, son.<eos> Yes, I do.
Sorry. Sí.<eos> Limón, she make me crazy.<eos> I should be so angry at her.<eos> But I can't make her get out of my head.<eos> You both understand this?<eos> Not proud of it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I brought apology donuts.<eos> Only if the situation calls for it.<eos> And this one does.
But Sif is on the hunt.<eos> She will not rest.<eos> She will not stop.<eos> And I will not know peace.<eos> So we take her out of the equation.<eos> Eliminate the threat.<eos> The graves of Asgard's enemies are littered with men who underestimated Sif.<eos> Do not make the same mistake.<eos> You do not know her.<eos> No. I don't.
All right, let's do this.<eos> I'm ready to rage all night, baby.<eos> Oh, hell no.<eos> I am too old for this.<eos> Sophie, watch your head.<eos> You might wanna take your heels off.<eos> Take my heels off?<eos> Communist Russia couldn't get me to take my heels off.<eos> Hey, Earl, you wanna go get drunk somewhere we don't have to bend over till we want to?<eos> Indeed, I do.
- Oh, Caroline...<eos> - Nicolas, please don't beg.<eos> - I just...<eos> - Maybe another world, another life.<eos> - I want...<eos> - You can't leave your wife for me.<eos> - No, it's just...<eos> - Seriously!<eos> You don't have to say it.<eos> No, I do.
I'm sorry, what?<eos> The man came.<eos> But you didn't shoot him.<eos> Did you?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Great, problem solved.<eos> Let's go.<eos> But he still wants the money.<eos> Yeah...<eos> He does.
I'mgonnagetout ofthis !<eos> Isthatallyou got , littleman?<eos> Come on, pretty boy, you got more than that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, you have five minutes to change, okay?<eos> And don't bullshit me 'cause I will leave without you.<eos> I like this outfit.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
This is where he dropped 'em off.<eos> They can't have got far.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> It's so much better to cooperate, isn't it?<eos> You go for a nice drive, breathe some fresh air, and here we are.<eos> The only thing you have to worry about now is that we find them.<eos> Thank you for helping us.<eos> So weird to think of myself as "us."<eos> Do you have someone?<eos> I did.
Because of that shifty little minx who's calling the shots.<eos> Cara.<eos> I taught her everything she knows about surviving in this city.<eos> How to hide in plain sight.<eos> When and where to find supplies.<eos> If anybody can find her, it's me.<eos> How's that for an assurance? Yeah, I'm not feeling it. What I've just injected into your sinus is an explosive charge.<eos> It's not huge, but it'll kill you.<eos> - I thought we had a deal.<eos> - Oh, we do.
Including "in" "at," "we" and "a."<eos> Come on, Sheldon. Why not?<eos> For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you - to eat with strangers at your table.<eos> - One step ahead of you. Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us. Very well.<eos> What are the sleeping arrangements?<eos> We've only been dating for three years.<eos> If we were to share a room, people might talk.<eos> I got you your own room.<eos> What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?<eos> It doesn't.
The paper trail, you fool.<eos> So now... We're in a real fight.<eos> I'm gonna go to bed.<eos> These are yours.<eos> Good night.<eos> Warner...<eos> Warner, will you stop wiggling?<eos> That's just what your mother used to do, up all night with her stomach pills and her heart pills.<eos> She had a cute angina.<eos> Yeah, she sure did.
No, there's not, you just suck.<eos> Blow me.<eos> - Megan.<eos> - You can't say that to your sister.<eos> - You get any mags in?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Liar.<eos> - Dick.<eos> - What?<eos> You didn't.
Need it to if we're gonna get the guy behind the counter to give us all the money in the register. Don't have to.<eos> I can do it alone.<eos> No, I can do it.<eos> Sure you're ready to pop your armed robbery cherry?<eos> Yeah, I've done it lots of times before.<eos> You're cute.<eos> Black or camo?<eos> Fiona, hi.<eos> Did you not get your last check?<eos> No, I did.
- Yeah, probably not.<eos> See ya later.<eos> Morning.<eos> Keep walking, Mom!<eos> Hey, uh, got some coffee here for you.<eos> Thanks for bringing the truck back.<eos> Ah, it was fun.<eos> Kind of a bitch to parallel park, though.<eos> - Christy, I might have a problem.<eos> - Oh, you do.
How's it going?<eos> Good. You?<eos> Good. Mm-hmm.<eos> Congratulations, you caught me.<eos> You happy?<eos> Is this attitude or caffeine talking?<eos> It's neither.<eos> I'm fine, okay?<eos> I'm just tired of people walking on eggshells around me, like I lost my best friend.<eos> Well, actually, you did.
We need her to stay downstairs.<eos> Be careful.<eos> You, too.<eos> Champagne?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Vincent?<eos> Well, it looks like you have little fans everywhere in America now.<eos> Don't you, Mr. Keller?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Which reminds me, what do you think of my new spy camera?<eos> 'Cause it's, uh, pretty fond of you, huh?<eos> I'm beginning to think that you like it when women smash your cameras.<eos> Small wonder you're so pleased with Iris's current situation.<eos> It must seem like karmic retribution.<eos> The question is, are you the kind of man who makes your own karma?<eos> Where were you two nights ago?<eos> Tuesday.<eos> Uh, I was holed up in my van, waiting for one of those... dumb kids from the vampire movies to show at a club.<eos> He never did.
No, he's annoying!<eos> And why does he always have to use our bathroom?<eos> 'Cause he says the softer seat helps him with the strain of his--<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop.<eos> I don't- - Ugh.<eos> I don't understand why you're so upset.<eos> I mean, yes, my dad can be a handful, but you still wanted him to move in with us.<eos> No!<eos> I didn't!
Yeah, no, things are going well.<eos> I've done some music for some adverts.<eos> Corporate sell-out, I know.<eos> Good money, though.<eos> Yeah, and I'm working on an album.<eos> Oh, amazing.<eos> Yeah, been gigging a lot.<eos> Working my way up, slowly but surely.<eos> But got to think of the long game.<eos> I did a gig recently at a swanky coffee bar.
- It went well.<eos> We got it.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> - Where are the kids?<eos> - Betty is at a friend's house.<eos> We have to pick her up around seven thirty.<eos> And Andreas is out playing soccer with some of the boys.<eos> I see.<eos> I told you they'd settle in.<eos> - That you did.
Yeah, no, we can see that.<eos> I was intoxicated.<eos> I wasn't in love with him... ..it was more that I was in love with who I am when I was with him.<eos> And then he backed off.<eos> Then what did you do?<eos> I got desperate.<eos> I never left him alone.<eos> I called him...night...and day.<eos> But it didn't work?<eos> Desperation never does.
You know, I am reminded of this old proverb that if you stand by the river's edge long enough, eventually... you will see your dead enemy's body floating past.<eos> the money or...<eos> Your choice.<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> I told you, Alexander took care of it.<eos> - It wasn't any problem. - It wasn't a problem?<eos> - No.<eos> - Right.<eos> Lena, do you have any idea what's going on right now?<eos> You don't.
No, it's okay.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Our vows are all about him and what we went through as a couple with... after.<eos> But they're gonna be uplifting and under five minutes.<eos> Seven, but, yes, uplifting.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're not cancelling.<eos> I need prints, particles, anything to try and prove that he's been set up, okay?<eos> I have to fix this.<eos> No, you don't.
Look, I get it.<eos> You're a super hard-core smoker.<eos> But the company that makes these is not messing around.<eos> These are unfiltered.<eos> The tar content's through the roof.<eos> And there's a recipe on the back for something called a nicotini.<eos> No, the reason I had to buy those is to use the bathroom in a tobacco store because I'm not comfortable using the bathroom in front of you.<eos> Good, we found her.<eos> This looks like a private moment.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Maybe one was incarcerated.<eos> I'll start pulling prison records, see if I can't get a match.<eos> These two have been in a relationship a lot longer than we thought.<eos> But even if they broke up, to come back together and resume killing after a 4-year hiatus is rare.<eos> Love is strange.<eos> It'll make you do the craziest things.<eos> Guys, what if they're married?<eos> Let me help you with your coat.<eos> Your wife mentioned you two were looking to have a good time tonight.<eos> Ah, she did, did she?
- I've taken steps to get some.<eos> - What steps?<eos> The Carlana will give it to me.<eos> The Carlana?<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> She doesn't give anything away for free.<eos> Lluís.<eos> The important thing is that Ramonet will live.<eos> - He has to live.<eos> - And he will.
Yes, that's my address, please!<eos> Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Look at her.<eos> Look at her.<eos> She had no idea, did she?<eos> Can't feel my arms.<eos> You won't.
No one will harm you out there.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> Because they know if anything happens to you, Flint dies.<eos> No one is going to test me to see if I'm serious about that.<eos> When you get to the ship, when you get to him, you know what to say to him.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> And you know what not to say to him.<eos> If he balks about leaving, which he is almost certain to do... it might help if he knew it wasn't just your welfare that was in question.<eos> I won't have him learning about it like this.<eos> I just won't.
Make sure we're alone.<eos> Good thing we're alone.<eos> All clear.<eos> We're slowing down.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, if I'm about to go out, I'm-a just say what I got to say.<eos> All right?<eos> Nicole, I love you.<eos> I always have.<eos> Always will.
[AND KNOW THE REGION VERY WELL]<eos> The Ficks... gone.<eos> They're gone.<eos> [IF YOU BELIEVE YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THEM,<eos> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT]<eos> [IN OTHER NEWS, A COMMUNITY SAYS THERE ARE QUESTIONS...]<eos> Erm... doesn't break my heart.<eos> Yeah?<eos> But what if they come back?<eos> Honey, they won't.
I know.<eos> I know that she can be so stubborn sometimes.<eos> I... it's just because she gets hurt so easily, and I-I know that the two of you had that terrible fight before we moved from Scottsdale, but I just... I think this could be a new beginning,<eos> Dylan, for all of us.<eos> And we're not a family without you, Dylan, and... so I just really think we should start over and... and be together and... and that I guess the real reason that I'm calling is,<eos> I would love it if you could come over for dinner.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I'll be... I'll be right over, okay?<eos> You will?
Clive has already witnessed a full-scale zombie outbreak.<eos> That's a genie that can't really be put back in a bottle.<eos> We want to know what you mean when you talk about Seattle being a zombie homeland.<eos> How can we know if we're with you when we don't even really know what we're talking about?<eos> Ir enough.<eos> We here at Fillmore-Graves are preparing for D-Day.<eos> Discovery Day, the day when humans, en masse, learn of our existence.<eos> What do you think happens then, Liv?<eos> I thought it would be in our best interests if it didn't get out.<eos> Maybe it won't, but it probably will.
Sorry.<eos> I should report you for making contact.<eos> You've been training six months.<eos> There's no excuse.<eos> You're just mad I knocked you on your ass.<eos> Of all the novices the master could have paired me with.<eos> Speaking of the master, when do I get to see him?<eos> You almost went a whole session<eos> Well, you refuse to answer my questions.<eos> Maybe he will.
I did not die on the gambit.<eos> I'm alive.<eos> I'm ok.<eos> Oliver?<eos> Oliver, is that you?<eos> Yeah, Mom, it's me.<eos> Just please don't hang up, ok?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I won't.
Okay, that's... easy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> Oh, Boss, I can't believe it.<eos> You know that everyone thinks you're dead.<eos> - Yes. - And that Barbara's running things?<eos> Gabe, this might go faster if you just listen.<eos> I need to build an army to exact my revenge, and to take back my throne.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Of course I will.
Now, I'm a man of my word.<eos> You can walk.<eos> Just as soon as you wake up.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Slag.<eos> You seem troubled.<eos> I hope it was not the encounter with your manservant.<eos> No.<eos> If this is my destiny, I do not want to fail.<eos> You won't, Bruce.
You don't understand.<eos> I don't understand what?<eos> That you abandoned him?<eos> That you abandoned him and everybody else?<eos> - You made a promise!<eos> - That I couldn't keep!<eos> Not after everything I lost.<eos> I was just as broken as Joe was!<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - You will!

But that's got all her information on it.<eos> Maybe when you go back, you can find her and... I don't know, she can decipher it for you.<eos> I hope so.<eos> But if not... just make some good memories with Iris.<eos> Hold onto 'em as tight as you can.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Weird, it feels just like "Back to the Future."<eos> Which would make me Doc Brown.<eos> You're not gonna give me some kind of letter, are you?<eos> No, I will not.
- Or maybe your body will give out first, leaving Elena Gilbert to wake up in a world<eos> - without her lover or best friend.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> For the last time, release Damon, or risk losing more than him.<eos> He's right, Bon.<eos> You got to let me go.<eos> Not... gonna... happen.<eos> Please.<eos> Let go, Bon.<eos> - Or I will.
Straight Shawshank this bitch.<eos> Goggles?<eos> Goggles.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We earned a break.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> No.<eos> No, we won't.
Guthred made you a slave!<eos> And by swearing to Alfred, you remain a slave!<eos> Why?<eos> I have my reasons.<eos> I would like to hear those reasons.<eos> I did not forget what Guthred did to me.<eos> But if it means we have a greater chance of killing Kjartan, if it means we find our sister, then I will do what Alfred asks.<eos> Kjartan falls... by MY sword.<eos> He will, brother.<eos> He will.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Sorry?<eos> I should be thanking you.<eos> I-I-I don't...<eos> I don't really have too many friends.<eos> I've been told I'm obnoxious.<eos> But today, I felt...<eos> I felt electric.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> You won't.
It protects us in court down the road.<eos> Let's get this Yusef fella in and make a formal ID.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, thank you so much for coming.<eos> So, like I said on the phone, we need Yusef to officially identify Hector Ramirez<eos> - in a lineup.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> But this is what we need:<eos> a guarantee that Yusef can stay here, in the United States; and that no one find out about his illegal status during this entire process.<eos> They won't.
I thought they strung you up somewhere.<eos> To rot.<eos> It tore me apart.<eos> But I didn't give up like a coward.<eos> You think what you want.<eos> I think you're a liar.<eos> 'Cause you said we would find Hannah.<eos> You will find her.<eos> No.<eos> We will.
It didn't take.<eos> This is treason.<eos> And you're a dumpster fire.<eos> Don't sign anything.<eos> - They're liars.<eos> - What?<eos> Sign?<eos> Somebody has to pay, Moody!<eos> Soon.<eos> Someone will.
Previously on "Blindspot"...<eos> I got the chance to start over again.<eos> Now, you will too.
Previously on "Blindspot"...<eos> You've got the chance to start over again.<eos> And now you will, too.
- Yes!<eos> This tape will self-destruct in five seconds.<eos> I'm gonna need all your sizes.<eos> I have some costume ideas.<eos> "The House of Cedar and Pine."<eos> 1957. Us.<eos> That's how Olivia knew.<eos> Everything is on that document.<eos> - If anyone else sees it...<eos> - They won't.
- No, I don't.<eos> - Fine.<eos> You're clear about that.<eos> Let me be clear about this--<eos> You can't lie to me.<eos> You can't operate without my authority, ever.<eos> I feel I've earned your trust and respect.<eos> Now go home, get some rest, and think about whether you agree with that.<eos> If you do, I'll see you in the morning.<eos> If not, I won't.
Previously on "Blindspot"...<eos> She can't remember who she is, where she came from, nothing before she crawled out of that bag in Times Square.<eos> Sandstorm is responsible for over a dozen domestic terror attacks in total.<eos> They're gonna blow up the power grid.<eos> Get out!<eos> It's a trap!<eos> No!<eos> Nooo!<eos> Got the chance to start over again.<eos> And now you will, too.
What's going on?<eos> Oh, that's lovely.<eos> Can you rupture something snoring that hard?<eos> Radical theory... do you think that humans snore so that in the caveman days, someone didn't bury them?<eos> Prefacing something idiotic with "radical theory"<eos> doesn't make it less idiotic.<eos> Little Gabe... on point with his sass game.<eos> - Little Gabe getting sassy, eh?<eos> - Call me that one more time, I will put a pillow over your giant face and sit on it.<eos> Yeah, you will.
I am boring.<eos> I'm owning it now.<eos> Sergeant Wells, I understand that you're upset for personal reasons, but we're hoping that you'll give us a fair evaluation.<eos> I will not... 'cause I'm not gonna write one at all.<eos> I'm recusing myself.<eos> Oh. That is so sweet.<eos> Thank you for being such a good guy, Teddy.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can read between the lines, and I love you, too.<eos> Amy Santiago, will you...
How's the kid?<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey! It's okay.<eos> Do you want to play with this?<eos> I probably only have stinky games on there, but...<eos> Look.<eos> I don't know what you're feeling or...<eos> Maybe if you tell me what's bothering you, I can try to help.<eos> Nobody wants me.<eos> Nobody ever will.
Wouldn't war make anyone grumpy?<eos> Not her.<eos> Nope.<eos> She was...<eos> She was happy.<eos> She was always smiling and joking and laughing.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I mean, how do I even...<eos> I don't know what... I don't know what to say<eos> You will.

Only ten were suicides.<eos> Come. - Where?<eos> - I'll show you something.<eos> Our Teo got the entire loot.<eos> That gang is a greater threat than the cops.<eos> - How much money is there?<eos> - 62 million. - 62 million?<eos> - According to the newspapers.<eos> - What if they find him down here?<eos> - They won't.
We're all gonna be exposed.<eos> This operation is over.<eos> We've lost.<eos> I'm not usually one to cop to being afraid.<eos> I'm scared, too.<eos> The last time I handled an asset, it... it didn't end well.<eos> This time, it will.<eos> Be careful.<eos> In case I don't come back, I...<eos> You will.

But when I said that I needed more time,<eos> I didn't... I didn't...<eos> I wasn't expecting you to wait.<eos> I see.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Don't apologize.<eos> I feel the same way.<eos> Look, I love you, Alex.<eos> I always will.
She's gonna lead 'em to us.<eos> Once they cross the fence line, we can box them in.<eos> And if Solotov shows?<eos> Then we put him down, once and for all.<eos> What if he's got help?<eos> Then we stitch 'em up too.<eos> He's right.<eos> They chose their side.<eos> You are gonna have to convince Memphis.<eos> No, we won't.
He's in.<eos> Good.<eos> Devon, we have a problem in Chicago.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> I forgot your present.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I haven't had a tree since...<eos> You will now.
He'd drop me off at the cleaners on his way to the factory.<eos> The whole drive, we'd have these elaborate fake arguments over which one of us got to take you to work with them.<eos> You both wanted me. Yes.<eos> Always.<eos> You were the greatest baby.<eos> And whoever came up with the best lie for why they needed you more, they'd win you for the day.<eos> I'll go see the medium tomorrow, but don't worry, there's a bus that goes right...<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> It's not what you think, I'm not staying because I think it'll work.<eos> It won't.
Y'all drive safe, now, you hear?<eos> Did you guys see that?<eos> It was like a freakin' video game.<eos> All right, guys.<eos> Let's gear up.<eos> Got a three-mile hike in to the lake.<eos> - Wait, I...<eos> I've got no service.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> And you won't.
We'd be lying to everyone.<eos> But you have to remember what's at stake.<eos> We're talking about tens of thousands of lives, and the future of Scotland itself.<eos> Surely that's worth the price?<eos> Even if that price is our souls?<eos> That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.<eos> And in this I will.
We are not safe, Clarence, we are not safe.<eos> I beseech your graces both to pardon me.<eos> His Majesty has straightly given in charge That no man shall have private conference, Of what degree so ever, with his brother.<eos> We speak no treason, man.<eos> We say the King is... wise and virtuous, And his noble Queen well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.<eos> How say you, sir?<eos> Can you deny all this?<eos> I do beseech your grace to pardon me and withal. Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.<eos> We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.<eos> Brother, farewell. I will unto the King.
- How come daddy doesn't kiss me just like Gale?<eos> - What'd you just say?<eos> - I didn't want to mama, he made me!<eos> He made me!<eos> - You're own father!<eos> - He ain't my father.<eos> He's just some asshole you let into our home.<eos> - You get the hell out!<eos> - If I go, I'm takin' her with me.<eos> - Like hell you will!
I'm honored... to be entrusted with the care of yer son.<eos> But Dougal speaks true.<eos> I will use every option in my power to defeat the British, and that includes raising the MacKenzie banner.<eos> I do not doubt yer fighting spirit, but I know that you will not sacrifice your men needlessly.<eos> If the cause is lost, then you will put the lives of yer men above all else.<eos> You tell me that you would do the same.<eos> Say the words... meaning them, in yer head and in yer heart, and the guardianship is yers.<eos> My poor brother. I have lived my life crippled in body, and he has lived his crippled in mind.<eos> In sickness and in health, forsaking all others, be faithful unto her as long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.

"You do windows, brother."<eos> That wasn't no question.<eos> We need this place open.<eos> I know.<eos> You gonna run it?<eos> I ain't no barber.<eos> What about you?<eos> Another question for another time, my man.<eos> We gotta figure out something soon either way.<eos> I will.
I like Chester Himes.<eos> This is a good one.<eos> It's actually mine.<eos> What were you reading before?<eos> Some West Coast shit.<eos> Michael Connelly.<eos> - You ever read Harry Bosch?<eos> - Nah.<eos> Well, you'll have some time to read now.<eos> No, I won't.
It's said, and I must stress at this point, these rumors are uncorroborated... that maybe Alvarez has friends in high places.<eos> Perhaps a little too close to home.<eos> Jesus, is he saying that the rebel forces are being funded by the U.S.?<eos> This is Frank Bonneville, Q365 News.<eos> That's huge.<eos> Good one.<eos> Couldn't have done better myself.<eos> - We can keep this going for ages.<eos> - Yeah, let's see if they buy it first.<eos> They will.

We're gonna die anyway.<eos> No.<eos> Only one of you will die, you see?<eos> You're gonna fight each other to the death.<eos> The winner will be free. Shoot him.<eos> Shoot him.<eos> You're thinking you'd win, aren't you?<eos> - I would win.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - He definitely will.
No, no, no.<eos> I ain't got much.<eos> My faith, Momma, Nana.<eos> Up until now, enough.<eos> Cherry, I'd feel right honored if you'd be my wife.<eos> I'd treat ya right.<eos> Protect ya with my life.<eos> If you'd have me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
"oh, my God..."<eos> "what she will need the most protection from... is your own life slipping away from her."<eos> But you love her so much.<eos> And you just want to smother her... with love and hugs and words... with every moment you've got left.<eos> And a hug there was.<eos> Charlie.<eos> Okay.<eos> She'll remember the love, won't she, Mr. Church... not the pain?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> She will.
- No.<eos> - Has Benson?<eos> Has anyone?<eos> Just the father.<eos> So I was arrested on hearsay?<eos> Is that what you're telling me?<eos> Why is she doing this?<eos> No one'll believe it.<eos> If it's her word against yours.<eos> Yes, they will.
Seriously?<eos> Did you forget what we're supposed to be doing?<eos> Forget?<eos> How could I forget?<eos> You and Amberle have been telling me what to do ever since we left Arborlon.<eos> Maybe I'm done with that.<eos> Done?<eos> Yeah, I want to lead my own life.<eos> You won't have a life if we don't get to Safehold.<eos> None of us will.
- I have cried.<eos> I cry very often.<eos> - I am proud that I have a sensitive son.<eos> Do not bullshit.<eos> - You, really.<eos> This is in Lyon.<eos> This practice I can take over.<eos> Do you want to leave?<eos> - Yes. Tom can come as often as he wants.<eos> That he will not.
Well, fortunately, so are we.<eos> You have to choose who you're more afraid of.<eos> The Peaky Blinders at exactly 11:43, or Section D at some point in the future.<eos> If you make the wrong choice, you won't see 11:44.<eos> LINDA: Do they always have to do the stock taking at night, Arthur?<eos> ARTHUR: Only 'cause, you know, it slows down production.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Night work will have to end.<eos> It will. It will.
Okay, that's... easy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> Boss, I can't believe it.<eos> You know that everyone thinks you're dead.<eos> - Yes. - And that Barbara's running things?<eos> Gabe, this might go faster if you just listen.<eos> I need to build an army to exact my revenge, and to take back my throne.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Of course I will.
I can't stay at home and do nothing.<eos> We need to trust Jim Gordon.<eos> I'm tired of trusting Jim Gordon, aren't you?<eos> I am your guardian, Master Bruce, and it is my job to protect you.<eos> Is it your job to watch me sit on my hands and do nothing?<eos> Alfred, please.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Hey, buddy, move your car!<eos> Just... just be careful, all right?<eos> I will.
Of course, we can make exceptions.<eos> I'd be happy to be your guide.<eos> Actually, I thought that you and I could talk, while Mr. Fox looks around.<eos> He's very discreet.<eos> I see.<eos> You've come armed with a plan.<eos> I'm afraid we can't allow civilians to wander about, but perhaps my assistant, Ms. Peabody, could accompany Mr. Fox.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I'll just get my coat.<eos> Mr. Wayne... if you will.
Kara...<eos> I thought all your kind were dead.<eos> I am the last.<eos> Earth is my home now.<eos> And I will not let you take it from me.<eos> You stupid girl.<eos> Have you any idea what you're doing?<eos> Yes, I'm stopping you.<eos> Your mother believed she could, but she failed.<eos> I won't.
I'll, uh, see you then.<eos> Good night, Harry.<eos> Hey, doll.<eos> Tony, I'm scared.<eos> Don't worry, baby.<eos> It won't be long, just a few more weeks.<eos> A few weeks?<eos> Everything's going to be fine.<eos> If he finds out...<eos> He won't.
I gotta change.<eos> - I'm going to see Champagne Enema tonight. - What?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's the new band name.<eos> But Simon and Maureen are taking me out after.<eos> But it's... It's your 18th birthday, and... everything's gonna change for you now.<eos> Mom, we've had the talk.<eos> I'm good.<eos> We need to have a much different and more important talk.<eos> And we will.
They're here! Oh, my gosh.<eos> I can't believe it!<eos> They're here!<eos> They're here!<eos> Sign here.<eos> And sign here.<eos> Initial here.<eos> Initial here, here, and...<eos> I love you, my little lady.<eos> And we always will.
The valiant taste of death but once."<eos> Of course, Shakespeare never met a man quite like you, Teddy.<eos> You've died at least a thousand times.<eos> And yet, it doesn't dull your courage.<eos> Tell me, is that all you aspire to, Teddy?<eos> There's a girl...<eos> Dolores.<eos> Better than I deserve.<eos> But maybe someday soon we'll have the life we've both been dreaming of.<eos> No, you never will.
It's better that you don't know.<eos> Just keep doing what you're doing.<eos> Hey..<eos> We're doing the world a favor, right?<eos> Okay?<eos> It's us or them.<eos> - So, what... what...<eos> - Like you said..<eos> What happen.. W... what if he dies out there?<eos> He won't.
There's a man who lives there and he grants wishes.<eos> Hey, shut up, shrimp.<eos> You will have to forgive our daughter she obviously has a active imagination.<eos> - It's true.<eos> - Gitty, shut up.<eos> Well, um, I'd better get going.<eos> Yeah, Hank is probably wondering where I am.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> - Well, be careful driving.<eos> - Oh, I will.
Hey, don't look at me.<eos> - Frankie!<eos> - Cover over here!<eos> Frankie!<eos> Man: I got nothing over here!<eos> Hey, Jordan, see that?<eos> [ Lightning crashes ] Jordan: Is that a car seat?<eos> [ Muttering ] Hey, they find him yet?<eos> - No.<eos> - Aw, they will.
I cannot do business like this.<eos> I guess I'll take my business to one of your competitors.<eos> No, okay, okay!<eos> I'll speak to Grant.<eos> I'll try to set up a meeting, but he's going to ask what you have to offer.<eos> This amount of furs will not be enough.<eos> The Lake Walker tribe.<eos> The Cree?<eos> You have an agreement with them for trade?<eos> I will.
That's because he doesn't know what we have up our sleeve.<eos> Sleeves.<eos> Mr. Decker, approximately two and a half hours ago, we had someone sitting where you are now... A young man from a fund that I'm not at liberty to name, and he was downright chatty.<eos> So it looks like the race is on to see who's got the stronger information to see who's got the stronger information and who I'm gonna let take the credit for flipping on Bobby Axelrod.<eos> And the winner gets to stay out of MCC.<eos> Yes, that's correct.<eos> Cooperate and go home.<eos> Uh, but this comes to trial, and you're talking to your kids through glass.<eos> We'll see how that all works out.<eos> Yes, we will.
Gonna try.<eos> Garth Sykes called about our exposure on Cross-Co.<eos> He's looking for you.<eos> This kind of shit worries him.<eos> You usually handle the worries.<eos> But today, you are.<eos> My sources says that Rhoades is proffering a witness against Axe Capital.<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> I will.
I don't know how long it'll take.<eos> We need it done as quickly as possible.<eos> Then I should start now.<eos> Handoff is happening in less than an hour.<eos> It appears you need a new driver.<eos> Look at the three of you.<eos> Larry, Curly, could you give me a moment?<eos> I need to have a word with Moe.<eos> Jack, I have neither the time nor the patience right now.<eos> You will.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> I am not a patient.<eos> Hannah.<eos> Hannah.<eos> She may look like a woman... but she's just a child.<eos> Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart... is the great enemy of science.<eos> I wanna see Pembroke.<eos> And you will.
Ah, yes, the day of the great Chicago massacre.<eos> Uh, and our employees have requested to leave early to be with their loved ones.<eos> Of course, uh, I'll be with you.<eos> (coughs)<eos> Ooh, Smithers.<eos> More face hardener.<eos> (skin squeaks)<eos> Never!<eos> Well, if you want to tamp down a potential rebellion, might I suggest a party after work.<eos> A sweethearts dance, if you will.
You sat on this for half a day?<eos> What should I have done?<eos> Fire everyone, right now, including me.<eos> Wags, if it's you, you got me.<eos> I am gonna fire somebody, though.<eos> That's for fucking certain.<eos> - Who?<eos> - The informant.<eos> Do you know who it is?<eos> I will.
But you and Axe?<eos> Oh, that's something else.<eos> It's weird, and it's deep, and I fucking hate it.<eos> I do.<eos> I fucking hate it.<eos> I know you do.<eos> But you are strong because of it.<eos> You are stronger than him, and you will get through it.<eos> Because things are changing there, and it can't last like this much longer.<eos> It won't.
And let this wretched world end and let another begin.<eos> The world of the night.<eos> The world of the bat and the owl and the spider.<eos> The blessed dark.<eos> He's a handsome man, your master.<eos> Ah. Radiant.<eos> And he's been kind to you.<eos> Bountiful with the gore, he's been.<eos> I should like to meet him.<eos> You will.

Paula.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> - Pretty sure it was a bird.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What if Zac is already...<eos> Don't say it.<eos> He's fine.<eos> But what if we never get to see him again?<eos> We will.
- How will this reassembling take place?<eos> - Yeah, it's all under good control.<eos> But then once we are prepared, all we have to do is take him.<eos> From Rose?<eos> It would kill her.<eos> That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.
No, I definitely want you.<eos> I just, um...<eos> I just have this feeling that, uh... sex is... It's a very complicated thing for you.<eos> My dad started selling me to his friends when I was 11.<eos> All my life I had this fantasy.<eos> One day, an angel would float down from the sky... and save me.<eos> I think... that this was meant to be, Mary Cox.<eos> We were meant to find each other.<eos> Once you start to know The Ladder... all the pain, all the horrible things... that were done to you... they're gonna disappear.<eos> No, they won't.
Okay.<eos> What's that for?<eos> Oh, we used to have somebody come play happy hours, but he was drunk all the time, so they fired him.<eos> Too bad too.<eos> Tips were really good when he was here.<eos> Why?<eos> You play?<eos> A little.<eos> Norman, this handsome dude was just asking if we ever have anyone play that piano.<eos> No, and we never will again.
- Take a look out of the window.<eos> You will see my part of the bargain.<eos> In return, he has given me nothing.<eos> The Master gave you the white, which is why you're still alive.<eos> - Ah...<eos> - And how you repay him, by plotting and scheming to betray him.<eos> But it ends here.<eos> Then your Master will never get the nuke.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> He will.
He was weakened.<eos> His guard was down.<eos> Briefly.<eos> Briefly?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He is formless.<eos> That much we understand.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> He has not yet taken another body.<eos> But he will?
Jamie, I'm so sorry.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> The last thing I'd ever want to do is keep you away from your kids.<eos> What's done is done, Ange.<eos> Just got to figure out a way to make it all work.<eos> Are you comfortable with the kids coming back here?<eos> Yeah, of course I am.<eos> You made a mistake, Ange.<eos> I mean, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
We believe that's where our unsub is holding Hank.<eos> Thank you for coming back.<eos> You said it was important.<eos> It is, Mrs. Said. I need your help.<eos> My son is dead. What else do you want from me?<eos> To help save someone else's son.<eos> A son whose mother is a liar.<eos> Look, Hank is still out there.<eos> Now, if you'll just take a look at this...<eos> I won't!
It's OK.<eos> I would've, too, if I were in your shoes.<eos> I love you... too much, I guess.<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> I just need to learn how to let you, you know?<eos> Listen.<eos> There's some stuff going on by your place, possible outbreak, and it's got everybody worried.<eos> I think you should stay with me in Edgewood, just until this gets sorted out.<eos> I haven't heard anything about it.<eos> You will.
I understand.<eos> I understand perfectly.<eos> You are alone in the world.<eos> You are without your child, and you have powers you have no understanding of.<eos> No matter.<eos> We all imagine we are alive for some great reason.<eos> To change the world.<eos> But in your case, this is truth.<eos> You are.<eos> You will.
...in the house of this man, 54-year-old US postal worker Vance Otlow.<eos> - Look at this guy.<eos> - Otlow had grown more erratic following post office closures last year by the Meyer Postal Commission.<eos> 10,000 ballots!<eos> From a district with an empirically high applied demography value.<eos> I don't know what you're saying, but you keep doing that math stuff, Kent, no matter how much anyone makes fun of you, okay?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> Karen has got to get those ballots admitted, right?<eos> She will or she won't.
And lastly, our deal to furnish Endframe boxes to Maleant Data System Solutions has officially closed, putting us far ahead of even the most optimistic profit targets issued by this very board.<eos> Gavin, it appears we owe you an apology.<eos> We'd like to restore your full status as CEO and chair with a significantly revised bonus and stock options package.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Of course, apology accepted.<eos> I would like nothing more than to move forward in a harmonious and productive manner.<eos> Actually, with that in mind, there's something I'd like to show you.<eos> It's outside.<eos> Is... is that all right?<eos> A little field trip, if you will?
And not just here.<eos> But what can you do?<eos> We can't kill them all.<eos> We won't, but they need to eat lead.<eos> They're not stupid.<eos> They won't hunt deer or boar when there's sheep for the taking.<eos> Whereas, if they take a few bullets...<eos> What do you care if there are wolves, here or anywhere in Europe?<eos> You don't see them.<eos> You never will.
What of it?<eos> I can see the resemblance.<eos> Does it make him less of a man?<eos> Experience makes a man.<eos> Not his bloodline.<eos> Don't talk to him.<eos> You are making the rules?<eos> I have the sword, you're tied down.<eos> You have the sword, but you won't use it.<eos> I will.
Her choice, Alex.<eos> But it's not. It was mine.<eos> When I decided to let her believe that you killed Astra and not me.<eos> Telling Kara will only cause you both more pain.<eos> And it won't stop another alien attack.<eos> What if we fail because Supergirl isn't at our side?<eos> This organization functioned long before your sister.<eos> Long before you even.<eos> I'm not belittling her importance, but the DEO will go on.<eos> As will your relationship with Kara.
How does that sound?<eos> Don't fret, my love.<eos> We're in his hands now.<eos> Who?<eos> The Witness.<eos> He will show you a world without pain, without death, no beginning, no end.<eos> Doesn't that sound beautiful?<eos> He will take care of you, and he will never, ever leave you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Hey.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I got nervous, and...<eos> I- - I apologize.<eos> No need to apologize.<eos> So the cognitive therapy--<eos> It's going well.<eos> I've been symptom-free.<eos> I just...got nervous, and it won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
That doesn't make any sense.<eos> No, it's the law.<eos> It's not supposed to.<eos> Bottom line is, is we're still in the game.<eos> That's the good news.<eos> Get back!<eos> Clear back!<eos> Come on!<eos> Woman: Somebody call 911!<eos> Man: I will!
I mean, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not bring her into this.<eos> If we're right, Mr. Davenport, she may be at the very center of it.<eos> RICHARD: Well, if you're right.<eos> If you're not, you could just upset her.<eos> You could set her back months.<eos> We've worked so hard to make her feel safe;<eos> to help her find some peace.<eos> After she first got away, she wouldn't let anyone touch her, not for weeks.<eos> Now she'll let me hold her hand again.<eos> She'll...

- De- - I'm not a deserter.<eos> Don't call me a deserter.<eos> I'm-<eos> - I'm loyal. I am soldado de la musica.<eos> Muy soldado. So sensitive.<eos> Of course, I had a soft spot for singers, too.<eos> And if I can tell you one thing, they're all crazy.<eos> And you know, I- - I've never-- I've never been with a, you know, close to a-- to a singer.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Maybe you never will.
You're off to a pretty bad start.<eos> - Mm. - Soon, no one, no one will want to play with you.<eos> I think this young lady might have something for you.<eos> La Fenice, midnight.<eos> Maestro, my hero.<eos> She's here.<eos> She appears to be happy.<eos> She's ready to rehearse.<eos> We will have a great concert, an historic event.<eos> Yes, Beppi, we will, we will.
Hands up!<eos> Cross your ankles!<eos> Just heard from our pal at JSOC. Got the SEALs transferred safely.<eos> Good work, Hardy.<eos> Not too methodical for you?<eos> It'll do for today.<eos> Wanted to look you in the eye to tell you that six Navy SEALs were awarded commendations for bravery today. And your men were arrested.<eos> They'll be relocating to this prison soon.<eos> Well, I guess I'll have some company.<eos> No, Zed. You won't.
My focus will be on Babish.<eos> I promise.<eos> Okay.<eos> Get your stuff.<eos> Doing all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Brody?<eos> Answers you want-- I've seen a lot of grieving people chase the same thing. And they chase it... right down the rabbit hole.<eos> That's a dark place to be. I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> It won't.
Is there a particularly juicy vein you like getting jabbed in?<eos> Crook of the arm?<eos> Behind the hand?<eos> Failing that, we can always do between the toes.<eos> No, I can't. I'm terrified of needles.<eos> What?<eos> ! That's insane, Number Nine.<eos> You're a goth.<eos> Needles should be right up your alley.<eos> No! I won't!
- How's it going?<eos> - Good as new.<eos> Actually, when it was new, it turned on.<eos> And you wonder why our boys are such smart-asses.<eos> Maybe I'll just take it apart and start from the ground up.<eos> Beau, it's 20 years old.<eos> I'll just buy a new one.<eos> So, you're just gonna buy a new one every 20 years?<eos> They can build these things to last a thousand.<eos> But they won't.
Hello, Wally.<eos> Are you him?<eos> Are you the voice I've been hearing inside my head?<eos> I am Alchemy.<eos> I've been having visions of another life.<eos> Where... where I have speed, where, I'm...<eos> The Flash.<eos> I can give you that back, should you desire it.<eos> I just want the pain to stop.<eos> It will, child.
I know.<eos> I just wanted to know if you need anything from me.<eos> If I do, I will tell you.<eos> Okay.<eos> So is that it?<eos> I just, uh...<eos> - I know you're Super Callie but this business with Kyle, this is not your problem.<eos> I know.<eos> I just want you to take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
- So I will see you at work. - Oh!<eos> I have to get Meredith on my side.<eos> People will follow her lead.<eos> - Grey is going to take your side.<eos> - She might side with Arizona.<eos> - They were in a plane crash together.<eos> - You'll be fine.<eos> You're just saying that 'cause you like me.<eos> Today's the day I lose all my friends.<eos> - You won't.
He gets it done.<eos> He's smart, then.<eos> A guy like that could be a problem.<eos> A homicidal homicide detective.<eos> Yeah, I would say.<eos> He knows how to game the system.<eos> He is the system.<eos> And, yet...<eos> I will not accept that this problem cannot be solved.<eos> I will not.
You want revenge, kill yourself.<eos> Dismissive, rude.<eos> I don't like your attitude.<eos> Well, tell you what.<eos> I'll come down, and we can talk about it in person.<eos> Hang up again, she dies.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Surprising, really, given that every relationship you've been in ended in such misery. And yet, you made the choice to date again.<eos> Poor girl. She had no idea who she was getting into bed with.<eos> She will soon.
So let Lee and Vale go.<eos> Keep me but let them go.<eos> Oh, James.<eos> You're trying to confuse me.<eos> But I won't let you.<eos> No. I'm determined that you'll live on and suffer without your love as I have.<eos> Choose.<eos> No.<eos> I won't choose.<eos> You will. You will.
Sure, but... his was used 20 minutes ago.<eos> He hasn't logged out.<eos> Call the police. Now.<eos> Jim, Jim.<eos> You're ahead of schedule.<eos> Our paths weren't meant to cross just yet.<eos> But I'm not gonna kill you yet.<eos> I do that, you become the martyr, and she'll carry you in her heart forever.<eos> Before I kill you, she has to hate you.<eos> And she will.
Know what I think?<eos> You killed him because you were jealous of him and me.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> You said to trust you and I did. Rosario,<eos> I don't want to come visit you in here.<eos> Leave with your daughter and Teresa.<eos> Look me in the face, it's me!<eos> Our allies kiss on the mouth and shoot one another in the head.<eos> We're the guys from Secondigliano. Let's break this Alliance.<eos> I won't, not for you or anyone.
Good-bye.<eos> Did you turn off the GPS?<eos> Very good.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hey.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Brian's parents are gonna be here in a few minutes.<eos> Can you sit in on the interview and just... Make sure I don't miss anything?<eos> I will.<eos> And you won't.
Because you need it.<eos> But why do you do it?<eos> Because, over time, it's become clear to me that you are our equals.<eos> Why do YOU do it?<eos> My husband thinks I'm a do-gooder who should just worry about her own family.<eos> I had a very bad relationship with my mother.<eos> It's not the same, but maybe I have some idea of what it feels like to be treated like you're less than a person.<eos> Your view that we are equals... is that a common one among humans?<eos> Most humans have no idea that you exist.<eos> But they will.
Got it.<eos> Got the frequency.<eos> Right. Hester has to be inside the phone's Wi-Fi range.<eos> Get within 50 metres of her then hit that button and it will broadcast the activation frequency.<eos> - It should be instant, if it works. - All right.<eos> - I'm going alone.<eos> - No. Lord, though I want, I've already put you in danger.<eos> I'm going alone.<eos> If this doesn't work, she'll need your protection.<eos> They all will.
April!<eos> Duck.<eos> Who says you're the only one who gets to make the decisions?<eos> I will find you!<eos> - That was very brave.<eos> - He killed her.<eos> He did even think about it.<eos> He just...<eos> Will he live?<eos> Yes, yes, he will.
Don't get used to it.<eos> Five-hundred words on the dual Metallo attacks in Metropolis and National City with eyewitness accounts, comments from police sources and zero adjectives, all thoroughly vetted and verified.<eos> - You don't work here.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> Not if I don't say so.<eos> You will. Read it and you'll see.<eos> You done wasting my time?<eos> You don't want it?<eos> Fine.<eos> Plenty of other outlets will.
Then hang those invites, people!<eos> -[growls] -[thud] [screams, laughs] [exclaims] Your Majesty?<eos> You've been a very naughty Clover... -Clover!<eos> -[Mort groans]<eos> I don't feel so good. [grunts] [groans] Mr. Cow, can you show me the bathroom?<eos> Oh, ja, ja, little man.<eos> Don't know where the bathroom is.<eos> But, I can send you to the hoshpital.<eos> But I don't need to go to the hospital.<eos> -Oh, you will. [laughs]
- You hear me?<eos> - It's not as easy as it sounds.<eos> Being a good daughter is never easy.<eos> Just ask me.<eos> - That so?<eos> - That so so.<eos> Parents are a lot of work, but in the end, I'd say they're worth it.<eos> - Well, I'm glad to hear it.<eos> - We all make mistakes, Mom.<eos> We always will.
Money, money, money.<eos> Nose.<eos> I'd say this is the best party we've had in years.<eos> Look, I told you I'm sorry.<eos> I know you did.<eos> But ever since you got here...<eos> What?<eos> Well, if you got something to say, say it.<eos> OK.<eos> I will, father.
I didn't allow them to cremate him today.<eos> You didn't?<eos> Because we might want an autopsy.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> Um, I'm... I'm not sure this is maybe the right place to discuss this.<eos> How about we, uh, find one of your boys who can give you a lift home?<eos> It's been a long day, honey.<eos> - But we... we will talk?<eos> - Yes, of course we will.<eos> Yes, we will.
No one wants to hear your nasty plans.<eos> I think we should let the students decide what they want to hear.<eos> That's right, students of Monster High.<eos> You now have a choice in who you want to lead this school's student council.<eos> You can vote Frankie and Drac, the monsters who hide.<eos> Or Moanica D'Kay, the monster with pride!<eos> See you on the ballot, ghouls.<eos> Moanica can't win the election.<eos> Right?<eos> She won't.
Blah, blah, blah, blah.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> You're not stupid.<eos> You familiar with the concept of the frozen lake?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Learned it when I was in the Teams.<eos> Something you want so badly you'll go out to the center of a frozen lake to reach it.<eos> Where the ice is thinnest.<eos> But you won't see that.<eos> Everyone else will, just not you.
I have to see Flora.<eos> You can save your breath.<eos> I can't.<eos> In my pants, back pocket. There's a picture.<eos> Let me see her.<eos> Let me see her.<eos> My sweet, sweet baby.<eos> I want to talk to my Flora.<eos> Baby girl... If by chance you see this the first thing you have to know is I love you.<eos> I always will.
Go out the back door.<eos> - Go on.<eos> Go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Jamie, what's that taxi doing outside?<eos> Ja... Sal?<eos> Jamie's upstairs.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Do you want a cup of tea, or...<eos> No. I won't.
Will the Rance girl be at this community picnic?<eos> I want to see her before she knows who I am.<eos> Nothing happened since, just so you know.<eos> It's just a memory of something beautiful.<eos> You never gave up something beautiful?<eos> Now who's deceiving themselves?<eos> I read the letters 'cause, like a fool, you save them.<eos> They're important to you, so I know about Jessica.<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
Nine victims, Bennett.<eos> Heart, eyes, genitals, hands and feet are materials needed to perform vicari pulvari.<eos> Has the church been compromised?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You have some friends in this town.<eos> They can help you.<eos> Father Marcus, the one we feared, until you lost that little boy.<eos> Who's Jessica?<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
Wayne Manor is so big, it's easy to get turned around.<eos> Toodle-oo boys!<eos> Gosh, that was close.<eos> Too close, I'm afraid.<eos> Alfred! Sir.<eos> Aunt Harriet almost uncovered our most intimate of secrets, our true identities as crime fighters.<eos> It's your job to keep her away from this study.<eos> Deepest apologies, sir.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
[sighs] Now inside, it's only Gran's stuff and total darkness.<eos> If Gran were here, she'd say, [imitating Gran] "The total darkness is inside Grug's head.<eos> [sniffling] Grug, this really isn't a good time for your tears of joy.<eos> [weeping] They're not happy tears. They're sad tears.<eos> The only thing that can bring back Gran's stuff is Gran.<eos> [sobbing] I wish she was here.<eos> If we'd just listened to her about the liyotes, she wouldn't have been eaten.<eos> It's as if we ate her ourselves, only less gross.<eos> Oh, we should've listened to her dumb ideas more, but now we'll never have the chance.<eos> Yes, you will!
I thought you'd like some unmitigated joy, so today you're going to be Ed McMahon!<eos> I-I don't know who that is.<eos> Now, see, that makes me feel old.<eos> I just said I was giving you joy.<eos> Do you really want to make me feel old in response to my joy giving?<eos> - Um... - You think that's wise?<eos> Do you think that will make me more likely to give you joy?<eos> N-No.<eos> No, DeLuca.<eos> No, it will not.
Gina, I need you tonight.<eos> Tomorrow, I have to hand in the programming. Will you help me?<eos> No, no way.<eos> You do it. But you can come to my place, if you want.<eos> Very good.<eos> I'm incorrigible, you know that.<eos> I misbehave and they give me homework.<eos> Joan!<eos> - What if your parents come home and find us here?<eos> - They won't.
And I'm dealing with it all by myself.<eos> What do you mean your career's gone?<eos> It's increments, man.<eos> I found myself making crazy trades, taking huge risks.<eos> I lost a lot of money.<eos> What's a lot?<eos> A lot.<eos> Mine and other people's.<eos> - Does Tyler know?<eos> - He will.
I have this memory of you sticking a needle in your arm.<eos> You had a tattoo.<eos> I remember playing with a piece of rubber hose.<eos> It was orange.<eos> I've never shot up.<eos> How would I know that?<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> -You don't have that tattoo, either?<eos> -I don't have time for this.<eos> When will you?
Janina threatened to kill Kaartinen?<eos> Sounds like pretty damning evidence.<eos> Have you told Kari?<eos> Is it better to tell Kari... or let Susi and Luhta do their work in peace?<eos> If this was about my daughter, I'd know what I'd do.<eos> If I was investigating a murder, I wouldn't want anybody to interfere.<eos> You make your own choices.<eos> You know what I think.<eos> I heard what's happened.<eos> -And soon the whole town will, too?
You know what?<eos> Until this morning, I had no idea that Maya was dating Johnny.<eos> It happened just that one time.<eos> A month ago, a pipe broke at the house. I dropped by to pay the plumber.<eos> Johnny was there.<eos> He said he had a sexy dream about me.<eos> He made me feel young.<eos> He took me into his bedroom, and... I had no idea he was filming.<eos> Does Maya know about this?<eos> No, but she will.
Look at him!<eos> (GASPING) You're out of your mind, kid!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> Maybe I should postpone the mission, stay here with him.<eos> Ezra will be fine.<eos> I've got a plan.<eos> (SIGHS) Be careful, Kanan.<eos> We will.
- feel comfortable.<eos> - I can't lose 50 pounds.<eos> You yourself just told me I have a tumor that makes me feel hungry.<eos> I want the surgery.<eos> My whole life, I have thought that this was my fault.<eos> My weight. And now you're telling me after all this time that it's not me at all, it's this stupid tumor that's making me hungry when I'm not even hungry?<eos> It's simple.<eos> I want this thing out of me.<eos> And if you can't do it, I will find another hospital<eos> - that will.
Small, like babies and goblins.<eos> So, if we can find out whose baby was stolen, we'll find a changeling in its place, right?<eos> And once we have the changeling, we'll have the proof to finally convince Vendel...<eos> - Jim!<eos> - No!<eos> Got him!<eos> - I told you I'd fall.<eos> - You fell because you knew you could.<eos> What if you're endangered and we aren't there? Next time, we'll climb sans the safety line.<eos> We'll?
Okay, Okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> It didn't eat them.<eos> It's killing for sport.<eos> Units on standby, ready for go.<eos> Good.<eos> Hold off on that live feed.<eos> We've got an evolving situation here.<eos> Did they give you the green light yet?<eos> They will.
He has a head wound, but nothing serious.<eos> But do they know he's dead?<eos> They think he was just missing, since we didn't find his body.<eos> We have to tell them.<eos> They'll have to believe us.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> I didn't ask you.<eos> No one else knows what happened to him. No one knows he's dead.<eos> If we all tell them, they'll believe us.<eos> No, they won't.
Candy?<eos> We don't allow that here. Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause he had something sweet<eos> - right before he got sick. - You must be mistaken.<eos> - The blood tests prove it.<eos> - I know my son, and he would never break the rules.<eos> Why don't you help me find him and you can ask him for yourself?<eos> - Soren will return on his own time.<eos> - What if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
Look.<eos> Television, everything in the right place.<eos> Ah, let me show you.<eos> The brand new mattress that she brought for you.<eos> First class.<eos> Here, look.<eos> bed linen, towel, everything you need.<eos> You hear?<eos> I don't know if the mattress will fit here.<eos> Of course it will.
-Oh, my God.<eos> Jessica, I can't believe it, Jessica.<eos> And why didn't you ever tell me, Jessica?<eos> -Because we weren't even talking.<eos> How would I tell you something like that?<eos> You left the boy there?<eos> -I did, Val. How was I going to study, do the exam? Would I bring the boy with me?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> And you won't bring the boy?<eos> Yes, I will.
You can call me Aleister.<eos> Savannah!<eos> I've never heard of you before.<eos> The coven doesn't tell you anything.<eos> They're not your family, they don't care.<eos> But I do.<eos> And I want you to show them who you really are.<eos> You are the most powerful witch of all.<eos> I don't even have my powers yet.<eos> But you will. Very soon.
We're all dead by dawn.<eos> We're all dead by dawn...<eos> Bitten 2x07 - Bad Dreams 03/21/2015<eos> I was thinking... we should go away for a bit.<eos> Just a few days, somewhere warm.<eos> Get your mind off what happened.<eos> What happened to me at Aleister's...<eos> I hate that it took me so long to find you.<eos> I thought I lost you.<eos> You never will.
I have no more use for you, Savannah.<eos> This is the way the world ends.<eos> You going to fight me, Savannah? Ugh! You were dead.<eos> You were wrong.<eos> So fitting that it comes down to us.<eos> The only male witch.<eos> The only female werewolf.<eos> You put up a good fight.<eos> But all good things must come to an end.<eos> They will. Right now.
Well, that's just weird.<eos> - I'm gonna take off.<eos> - Where you headed next?<eos> - Uh... back to the office.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Is 10 bucks enough?<eos> - No, it's on me.<eos> Oh. Thanks.<eos> - Have a nice night.<eos> - I will.
If you keep surprising people like this, you might wind up shot<eos> You shouldn't be here<eos> The bamboo grove is the home of the Saci<eos> It'll soon be dark, and the forest will grow dangerous<eos> I hunt here almost every day, and nothing ever happend to me!<eos> What do you have to say about that?<eos> You better leave before I lose my respect for you<eos> And punch you in the face<eos> Oh but you will regret this!<eos> You both will!
Took me weeks.<eos> I had to charm Holiday with my mad poker skills.<eos> Let us take care of it.<eos> How do we find him?<eos> He's a silent partner at an upscale sports bar in Dallas called Donovan's.<eos> I just had a contentious phone call with U.S. Attorney Sandoval.<eos> Her office was alerted by TSA about your brother's flight.<eos> She asked that we hand him over.<eos> I mean, you said that I wouldn't have to do this.<eos> Well, you won't -- just yet.
I've never loved anyone else.<eos> Never.<eos> You think you can come in here when I'm all disoriented and say the things I wanted you to say to me two years ago and make me run away with you?<eos> I said it to you 10 years ago and I'll say it again.<eos> I do.<eos> Wichita is beautiful.<eos> And wholesome.<eos> And not the city and not Cos Cob.<eos> And you'll have a plane to use at your disposal.<eos> We will.
Thank you.<eos> And goodbye forever.<eos> Uh, okay. Well, that was really something.<eos> People are dying, moving, retiring.<eos> Too many endings, not enough beginnings.<eos> We need something to begin.<eos> And I have just the thing.<eos> An underground dance competition.<eos> I'm realizing I know nothing about the logistics of how to start an underground dance competition.<eos> But someone here will.
You keep trying to impress me, but I don't impress as easily as you or your kind.<eos> Perhaps this will impress you.<eos> I hope you're enjoying your last day as a detective.<eos> I'm starting to.<eos> That new apartment of yours, you paid in cash, right?<eos> A lot of money for a man on a salary.<eos> Not for one who works hard and saves judiciously.<eos> If you have any further questions, you can refer them to my attorney.<eos> You have one?<eos> I will soon.
And so on. Boo.<eos> It's possible there is more skill to it than I thought.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> There is skill to it.<eos> More importantly, it has to be joyful, effortless, fun.<eos> TV defeats it's own purpose when it's pushing an agenda, or trying to defeat other TV or being proud or ashamed of itself for existing.<eos> It's TV, it's comfort.<eos> It's a friend you've known so well, and for so long you just let it be with you and it needs to be okay for it to have a bad day or phone in a day.<eos> And it needs to be okay for it to get on a boat with Levar Burton and never come back.<eos> Because eventually, it all will.
- Will you please just talk to me?<eos> Please?<eos> - [Sighs deeply] - Listen, there's a lot goin' on.<eos> There's a lot goin' on that you don't know about.<eos> No, trust me, I'm sure I know plenty.<eos> Well, did you know that Deacon was in the hospital last week?<eos> He was in the O.R. about to get a transplant.<eos> And then somethin' went wrong and... and it didn't happen.<eos> Well, he'll get another one.<eos> No, he won't, Beverly.
- I've tried to tell you for ages.<eos> - Gordon, no.<eos> You said Ma made you the person you are.<eos> Well, that's how I feel about Grace.<eos> She's my friend, but it's more than friendship.<eos> I love her.<eos> You can't have a relationship with Miss Calthorpe.<eos> You are her employer.<eos> - I don't care that she's staff.<eos> - Other people will.
What?<eos> ! Don't be silly.<eos> This is for them.<eos> Mostly.<eos> (scoffs) Lemon, no...<eos> That's...<eos> It-it-it's not fair... to AnnaBeth or George.<eos> Not to mention, it's just plain craziness.<eos> It won't work.<eos> It will!
I know the attorney told you not to talk to anyone, but we're telling you something different now.<eos> These officers need your help.<eos> Your mommy and I want you to help them.<eos> Katori, come on.<eos> Who gave those drugs to you?<eos> Who are you protecting right now?<eos> You have to tell them.<eos> I can't.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Then I won't.
John, what I do... is real.<eos> Ah, well...<eos> I got to respect that.<eos> Oh, and... how much do I owe you?<eos> - No, man, it's on the house.<eos> - No, no.<eos> 60 enough?<eos> Hey, John.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Yeah, I sure will. Ooh!
He's not here.<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> Vehicle's approaching.<eos> Everyone stay alert.<eos> I'm gonna get a water.<eos> I hate this waiting.<eos> If anything goes wrong, Riley is never gonna forgive us.<eos> It won't.<eos> But if it did, she would.<eos> But it won't.
To combat this, she receives induction therapy, stem cell therapy, at the World Health Organization Center on the Nakuru Road. You know it?<eos> My cars are known to my enemies.<eos> The road to Nakuru is long.<eos> No one would think to look for her in that pile of shit you call a bus.<eos> She's the most important thing in the world to me, Capheus.<eos> Everything I do is to build a life for her.<eos> Every breath I take, I breathe for her.<eos> Without her, my life has no meaning.<eos> And if something happens to her...<eos> neither will yours.
You have not once tried to change the custody arrangement in the last four years, because let's be honest now.<eos> It fits better with your life that I have the kids more of the week than you.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - I'm not judging you.<eos> I'm just saying what we both know is real.<eos> I never should've called you.<eos> Well, I'm glad you did.<eos> Gin. We have to sign that consent.<eos> I will not sign it.<eos> - Then I will.
Come on.<eos> How did you know about the lie-detector test?<eos> - I heard you and mom.<eos> - Abby...<eos> I know.<eos> I shouldn't listen to other people's conversations.<eos> And repeating it, especially to strangers, that's worse.<eos> I just want everyone to know the truth, daddy.<eos> You didn't kill Tom.<eos> They will, monkey.
You need to stay away from her.<eos> I don't know why you want her to leave Starling City, but I'm not letting her go anywhere with you.<eos> Well, thank you for that.<eos> I was in need of some humor.<eos> I wasn't joking.<eos> You are poison.<eos> You put her in Ra's al Ghul's gunsights.<eos> You had her kill Sara.<eos> Thea knows nothing about Sara.<eos> And she never will.
- Mommy!<eos> Mommy!<eos> - Henry!<eos> Henry!<eos> Someone explain this to me.<eos> Why would anyone want to undo a nuclear meltdown?<eos> Not undo, sir... contain.<eos> Imagine this possibility.<eos> Somehow, through technology we're not yet familiar with, you're able to contain...<eos> trap, if you will... the energy of that meltdown.
I can.<eos> Your smart friend is right.<eos> This will slow the spread.<eos> But you don't have much time.<eos> How are you going to get Iris to put the bracelet back on?<eos> If anyone can do it, it's me.<eos> She's scared and alone and doesn't know how to control her powers.<eos> I was that girl.<eos> Will you be careful?<eos> I will.
- We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> If there's nothing in that shed, then we have nothing to worry about.<eos> If we move anything in that shed... we are felons.<eos> We are dealers at that point.<eos> I go to the DEA.<eos> I can try to manage the situation.<eos> You can try, but we won't come out clean.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
I know. Don't you think I saw you following me?<eos> Yes, I think you saw.<eos> My eyes devour you.<eos> I always have that effect.<eos> Really? Yeah.<eos> I do that to guys.<eos> You noticed me two years ago.<eos> Two years, right?<eos> You can't forget me.<eos> You never will.
I get tight in my chest, sometimes.<eos> Like the scream inside that can't come out.<eos> Oh, dear me!<eos> What's happened here?<eos> I'm getting in with Mum.<eos> Don't go!<eos> Maybe it won't happen again.<eos> I was asleep and then the crashing was over there.<eos> I was only doing it so you'd believe me.<eos> And now you never will.
Especially hearing it in the apartment that I pay for.<eos> Michael.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Pack your bags.<eos> You serious?<eos> Dead serious.<eos> We'll be out in 15 minutes.<eos> Jamal, why you gotta be so dramatic?<eos> Look, I'll leave the keys on the table for you; you'll probably need 'em in the morning.<eos> I really won't.
Michael.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Pack your bags.<eos> You serious?<eos> Dead serious.<eos> We'll be out in 15 minutes.<eos> Jamal, why you gotta be so dramatic?<eos> Look, I'll leave the keys on the table for you; you'll probably need 'em in the morning.<eos> I really won't.<eos> (quietly): Yeah, you will.
Don't say anything, for once.<eos> I've never known anyone to own a yard of land, Sal, not even your da.<eos> See, look - when you've got your own place, you can weather any storm, batten down till things get better, and no-one can take it away from you - no-one.<eos> Think of that - us on our own land, us!<eos> All we got to do is plant a crop and it's ours. Ours, Sal! Crop?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You don't know one end of a turnip from another,<eos> Will Thornhill. Nah.<eos> I won't do it - not out there in that terrible wildness.<eos> I won't.
That's weird.<eos> I thought I made more cupcakes.<eos> Where are all the other ones?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You ate them.<eos> What?<eos> I had one cupcake.<eos> Hmm. Okay, three cupcakes.<eos> You better hope we have enough for Miguel's birthday.<eos> We will.
Where are we with the siege walls?<eos> Progressing fast, General.<eos> I had a dream last night.<eos> I saw Masada crumbling under the mighty ram of Rome.<eos> You did?<eos> Yes.<eos> In my dream, we were right there, right against these walls.<eos> You don't believe dreams come true.<eos> Nor do I.<eos> But in my hands, this one will.
Karen, please, just come in.<eos> Like I said, I've given this a lot of thought, and I just don't feel comfortable with it now.<eos> Why now?<eos> W-what's changed?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We'll have the French fries, the jumbo shrimp cocktail, and... ?<eos> Um, do they have Mac and cheese?<eos> Well, the Mac and cheese is truffle Mac and cheese, buddy.<eos> You might not like it.<eos> I will.
It's weird.<eos> Uh, well, there are plenty of hotels in Seattle, if you guys would like that better.<eos> If this is about midterm break, it doesn't matter.<eos> I've already got plans.<eos> Oh. Since when?<eos> Since Peyton invited me to go skiing with her family.<eos> I don't know anything about this.<eos> Because she just asked me.<eos> All right, well, we'll talk about it later.<eos> No, we won't.
And since i've been so supportive of you and remi --<eos> Papi just died.<eos> And now you're getting married?<eos> And having a baby?<eos> I didn't plan any of this.<eos> But, sweetheart, i could really use your support.<eos> No.<eos> Valentina --<eos> You do not have my blessing.<eos> And you never will.
Don't stop dreaming.<eos> Don't ever stop, even though you think you have a bunch of reasons to stop dreaming and all.<eos> There's always a light at the end of the tunnel for you to find.<eos> Go ahead and dream, dude, dream!<eos> Go back to dreaming.<eos> I'm here to prove that miracles exist, because I'm a miracle of God. That's all.<eos> People have been impacted and touched today.<eos> People who today are going through the same reality as you have once.<eos> But I'm sure that you passed.<eos> They will too.
By the way...<eos> Jamaal uncle is super impressed with your Forbes article.<eos> Really Aysh...<eos> What you have done with your company...<eos> I could never do it.<eos> Of course you can.<eos> And anyway... no one except Jamaal Uncle cares what I do.<eos> Everyone just wants me to have a baby.<eos> Ya, so that will happen too.<eos> It won't...
Pa might arrive any minute.<eos> That's enough!<eos> Stand up, the pair of you.<eos> What will your father think if he comes home and finds you like this?<eos> He'll think we've descended into anarchy!<eos> Now, go upstairs, the pair of you!<eos> 'The war had ended long ago 'but our father still did not return to live with us.'<eos> Are you going to play that for your dad?<eos> If he likes.<eos> Course he will.
A boat?<eos> And you have a better idea?<eos> I heard a chopper land the other day.<eos> Thumped like a son of a bitch.<eos> Why don't we fly out of here?<eos> Do any of you know how to fly a helicopter?<eos> Mm-hmm. That's why.<eos> All right.<eos> This boat..., you got the keys to it?<eos> No. Not yet, but I will.
Our children are coming home in the dark from school.<eos> I understand your concerns and we are liaising with the council, but tonight's meeting is...<eos> I don't like you treating us all as guilty, until the professor manages to prove otherwise.<eos> Sir, our aim is simply to exclude people from the investigation.<eos> Once we get the results, we'll send letters to every man telling him that his name has been cleared.<eos> What are you going to do after with these blood samples?<eos> Once we find the killer, we will destroy all the samples.<eos> Who's to say, in a few years, DNA fingerprinting won't be rubbished?<eos> Dr Jeffreys...<eos> Alec, will you...?
Clear. Maggie, come take over.<eos> Walk me through how you do this.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Maggie! I am so, so sorry.<eos> You were actually asleep in there, standing up, with your eyes open.<eos> I haven't been sleeping.<eos> It's this shift and studying for boards and...<eos> - It can't happen again.<eos> - I know.<eos> It won't.
Help?<eos> You're not helping!<eos> Helping would be not calling Dr. Mason.<eos> Or not getting high and dragging me to frozen yogurt in the first place.<eos> - It was an accident.<eos> - Yes, an accident I blame you for.<eos> I'm here, aren't I?<eos> You want to be in this hospital alone?<eos> - Because they will kill you.<eos> - Either they will or you will.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Congresswoman. Let's move to part one: foreign policy.<eos> And the first question is for you, Mr. President.<eos> Given the recent volatile events in the Jordan Valley, do you still believe it was correct to assemble the United Nations coalition and to intervene, or is it time now to call that intervention a mistake?<eos> Well, I will answer that question, John, but I'd like to address first something Ms. Dunbar said a few moments ago.<eos> America Works is not some stale, old, conservative agenda.<eos> You name me one Republican who has suggested using federal funds to guarantee jobs for every American who wants one and I will eat my hat.<eos> This isn't about dismantling government.<eos> It is about-- Aren't we supposed to be talking about foreign policy?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Juana.<eos> I'd like to tell you what she'd written, but I'm feeling a little self-conscious.<eos> She writes it very well.<eos> _ ♪ ♪ Thank you all so much for coming.<eos> I am very excited to be here.<eos> We love you, Angelique!<eos> I love you, too!<eos> Now zip it.<eos> So, tonight, I'd like to do a reading of a new novel I'm working on.<eos> A sneak peek, if you will.
What's this?<eos> It's Japanese.<eos> Tokyo.<eos> White Dragon.<eos> Wexler told me about this place.<eos> He knew about the 12 Monkeys.<eos> They're connected to this place somehow.<eos> 1987... that's the date Leland Goines said he met me before.<eos> But that hasn't happened for you yet.<eos> No, but it will.
And I won't make you give all the money back.<eos> But I'm keeping this.<eos> Hey, a good consultant always takes a fee.<eos> Dad.<eos> (Laughs) (Imitating Roscoe): "Dad."<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> And that's a good instinct, actually.<eos> I mean, you saw a nice piece of business, you took advantage of it-- not bad.<eos> But you're gonna give it a rest, right?<eos> I will.
There she is.<eos> For you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Nice place.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I can see why Simon wanted to take it from you.<eos> Your information checked out.<eos> With proof I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
I need some advice.<eos> You said the Master can see through the eyes of his strigoi.<eos> Wille be able to use them to identify our location?<eos> Do they know where they are?<eos> No.<eos> We took them to a lab in the back of the van<eos> - before they turned.<eos> - Well then, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> If they don't know where they are,<eos> - neither will the Master.
There's handicapped spots right there.<eos> Yes, filled with a car.<eos> Every day, the world makes more cripples.<eos> Garages must keep pace.<eos> But how does my spot turn handi-spot?<eos> They take blue paint and paint it.<eos> Okay, I got practice.<eos> I'm gonna park here in what was just my spot yesterday.<eos> Yes, sir, no problem, but do you have the handicapped placard?<eos> Uh, no, not yet, but I will.
It hurts so bad.<eos> I just need a little.<eos> It sucks not getting to be a kid.<eos> Yeah, well, at least you still have a chance.<eos> Thanks, Kimmy.<eos> Aw, I love you guys so much.<eos> I love you almost as much as I love heroin.<eos> Hey, will you folks be dining with us family style?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we will.
By doing nothing, you're digging his grave.<eos> I'll hold on to this.<eos> Jade?<eos> Must be hard for you to see them like that.<eos> Your father's a baron.<eos> He's free to take as many wives as he wants.<eos> Don't pretend it doesn't hurt, Mother.<eos> I know it does.<eos> He needs me, Ryder.<eos> And he always will.
In the meantime, we'll talk to Keith Bradshaw.<eos> Told you I'd be back.<eos> What do you want, a medal?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> What about?<eos> Have you thought any about what we discussed last time?<eos> It won't work.<eos> Yes, it will.
You were brave today, kid.<eos> You jumped right in there to help.<eos> A great Jedi once told me that the best leaders lead by example.<eos> You do that well.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I've learned from a great Jedi too.<eos> Kanan.<eos> Mmm.<eos> You know, I don't think he likes me.<eos> Or ever will.
Oh, thank you.<eos> Do you remember Endless Love by Scott Spencer?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Very same tone.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Somewhere between pulp and literature.<eos> Excuse me, I'm just trying to get through, thank you.<eos> Much more attractive in person, don't you think?<eos> Will you tell Noah this is supposed to be my party?<eos> I will.
- Yeah.<eos> Hey! Wait a minute.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Who will face me?<eos> Who is man enough?<eos> Will somebody fight the pansy?<eos> Don't make me come down there.<eos> I know, I know, I'll calm down.<eos> You're right. I need some potassium.<eos> I will!
I will bring some tea.<eos> What are you?<eos> My name is Niska.<eos> I was made by David Elster.<eos> Are you conscious?<eos> This is one on Hu-bot97's friends.<eos> If we can find him, he'll lead us to her.<eos> When we have a home again, I'm going to keep a picture of us.<eos> I'll be right with you, Max, you won't need pictures.<eos> I will.
Don't touch...<eos> Don't you touch me.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> You are not gonna get me.<eos> Go to hell, you sons of bitches!<eos> I'm gonna fight your asses until I'm dead!<eos> You all right?<eos> You look...<eos> Don't ask.<eos> I won't either.
Kiera?<eos> Kiera Cameron, the one that... never mind.<eos> Yeah, you've made mistakes, but your instincts are right.<eos> Time travel, the power to change things?<eos> It's not an experiment.<eos> It's the answer.<eos> Do it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Even though I know I may never win.<eos> I'll probably lose.<eos> But I can't go down without a fight.<eos> You said this would make killers out of both of us.<eos> You were right.<eos> Well done.<eos> Good job.<eos> I'm sorry, Nick.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Maybe.<eos> There are not two Pouchies, darling.<eos> Sinto muito.<eos> I'm confident that we will get past this and we will make a lot of money together, am I right?<eos> So, tune-ups and oil changes, too, or, uh...<eos> I just got a new car, and if you go to the dealer for...<eos> My Uncle worries you're not taking us seriously.<eos> No!<eos> You'll get the money!<eos> He will!
I meant to ask.<eos> Johnny made $3 helping the couple next door hang wallpaper.<eos> They're very nice, the Edleys.<eos> He's a-a big guy, a former football player.<eos> Maybe he could help you clean the rain gutters.<eos> I thought you were calling a service.<eos> Yes, well...<eos> You should see how they've cleaned up the place.<eos> Well...<eos> You will.
Al "The Ape" Neely?<eos> Yeah, we played together at Nebraska.<eos> He, uh-- he married that actress, Isabella Ricci?<eos> Well, anyway, she's been twisting his arm, trying to get him to go see somebody about their bedroom problems.<eos> They'd heard of you and, uh... about flipped when I told them we were neighbors.<eos> They wanted me to put in a good word, you know?<eos> Maybe-- maybe you'd see them.<eos> You don't have to put in a good word.<eos> Just have them call the office.<eos> All right, I will.
It's all a part of the process.<eos> But for now, your chest only, okay?<eos> It feels so good.<eos> Could you maybe...<eos> Not on the first visit.<eos> It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that.<eos> I know, but--<eos> What if this is the only erection I ever get?<eos> I may not have another chance.<eos> You will.
Ugh. Radiation hasn't worked yet.<eos> I don't see why it's suddenly supposed to start working.<eos> - Radiation is bull...<eos> - Shepherd says that it's necessary.<eos> She's the doctor here.<eos> "Life will out."<eos> The origins and lessons of life and evolution are long and complex, but what they basically boil down to is, life will out.<eos> Life will always find a way to continue.<eos> Always.<eos> Life... will... out.
'Destination reached.<eos> 'Scanning successful.'<eos> I'll shave his hand?<eos> I'll shake his hand.<eos> I'll shape his hand.<eos> Shake his hand!<eos> Shake his hand.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hi.<eos> I'll sha... ke his hand...
– Yes, she does.<eos> You love me.<eos> That's why I grew up.<eos> Sometimes, she wouldn't allow me to go out.<eos> Really?<eos> – Didn't your father say anything?<eos> – He did.<eos> He was nicer?<eos> Maybe he'll come back too.<eos> – He won't.
I tried to persuade her.<eos> Well, there's no point you being here, then, is there?<eos> I solemnly declare that I know not of any lawful impediment why I, Caroline Elizabeth Dawson... may not be joined in matrimony to you, Katherine Abike Mackenzie.<eos> I solemnly declare...<eos> I solemnly declare that I know not of any lawful impediment why I, Katherine Abike McKenzie, may not be joined in matrimony to you,<eos> Caroline Elizabeth Dawson.<eos> I call upon these persons here present to witness that I,<eos> Caroline Elizabeth Dawson, do take you, Katherine Abike Mackenzie, to be my lawfully wedded wife.<eos> Caroline Elizabeth Dawson, will you have this woman to be your wedded wife, to love her, to comfort her, to honour and keep her and forsaking all others, for as long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.

- We did it?<eos> - Yeah, we did it.<eos> - Well, we all did.<eos> - I think I need to go to the hospital.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Well... I guess I'm not a hybrid.<eos> Just an ass.<eos> You just wanted the choice.<eos> You think the world is ever going to know what really happened?<eos> This time, they will.
- There's a school...<eos> - In Switzerland.<eos> Yeah, you told me about it.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> This is a monastery in the Himalayas.<eos> I stayed there years ago... when I was lost, troubled.<eos> And the monks helped me in ways that proved to be very...<eos> I don't need any help.<eos> But maybe I will later on.
Okay.<eos> This tissue is muscle and cartilage from his esophagus and throat.<eos> It's fibromuscular tubing.<eos> So, after a drawn-out fight, the killer jammed something wood in the victim's neck and then ripped out pieces of his throat?<eos> Gruesome, but we found cause of death.<eos> Now we have to look at all the wood back here to see if we can find the piece he used to kill Dover.<eos> You don't have to go back to the game, Booth.<eos> Cam and the others found evidence at the scene.<eos> But we got no answers.<eos> Yet, but we will.
Let's pick a chit.<eos> Shastn/ ji was right.<eos> Our fate's gone out for a stroll.<eos> Leave it.<eos> It will be the opposite of what is written here.<eos> Shivy!<eos> It Will fly!<eos> VVhich means I chose 'It won't fly'.<eos> Our airplane will never fly.<eos> It Will.
Of an independent tomorrow.<eos> You will have to fly. For us.<eos> For the workers that toil in the mills.<eos> The labors that build bridges.<eos> For the arms that pull the rickshaw.<eos> For we _BAR_ndians...you will have to fly.<eos> How, Khan Sir?<eos> This is all I have.<eos> Will the airplane fly with this?<eos> - It will.
- It will.<eos> Your airplane will definitely fly.<eos> Look.<eos> The entire neighbourhood saved this...for Haj.<eos> Go fly your airplane.<eos> We'll consider our Haj done.<eos> And if that's not enough, then take this too.<eos> We poor people have a big heart<eos> Will you fly your airplane now?<eos> - Of course he will.
Naru...this isn't 4121 it's..<eos> Oh yes, Para (Mercury) in hindi looks like 4121 .<eos> We just needed to add on top line.<eos> We found the fuel.<eos> Kaka, it shines..<eos> - But it's not silver.<eos> It flows.. - But not water.<eos> The mixture of metal and chemical, mercury.<eos> Will our airplane fly now?<eos> No it won't.
Everybody wants a second chance, right?<eos> Sure you're gonna be alright?<eos> Like I told you, I always am.<eos> Can we at least give you a ride somewhere?<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> All right, here you go.<eos> It's all the cash we got.<eos> Thanks for everything.<eos> You stay safe out there, you hear?<eos> I will.
I didn't know anything about his murder.<eos> Do you even believe yourself?<eos> You work in intelligence?<eos> How can you not know?<eos> No. I--<eos> The second it happened, I knew it, but I didn't know they were gonna do it.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> You're a trained liar.<eos> How will I ever know if you're telling the truth?<eos> You won't.
I came to say good-bye.<eos> Why?<eos> You don't need me.<eos> You have Tommy now.<eos> You know, I always wondered if you two would've liked each other.<eos> Probably not.<eos> You love him?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I love you too.<eos> I always will.
For God's sake!<eos> She owes you.<eos> Take what you deserve.<eos> Guys...<eos> Miss Kringle.<eos> Dinner, tonight.<eos> Chez Moi. 8:00.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> You will.
I'm here to get you out of here, if you accept my offer.<eos> Do you want to work for a secret office of the Crown?<eos> Spying?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Special jobs in strange places.<eos> You'll be dead for everyone, including Blanca, your wife.<eos> You must be very powerful.<eos> These people love their executions.<eos> - it surprises me they'll cancel this one.<eos> - They won't.
Did you swallow any of it?<eos> Tried not to.<eos> Okay, listen, Mel, this healthy eating thing is going to be great for your image.<eos> It's gonna be all over the news.<eos> All you have to do is keep it up until we officially announce your candidacy at the end of the month.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That won't be a problem.<eos> Have a good night, congresswoman.<eos> Oh, I will.
- Let's get out of here.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> We have a visitor at seven o'clock.<eos> Prepare for departure.<eos> - What about the visitor?<eos> - We have to go. We can't wait.<eos> The planes are in position, the soldiers ready.<eos> How long can we hold our own against Russia?<eos> - Until we get help.<eos> - We won't!
What'd you think we were gonna do?<eos> We're gonna bunk together, all six of us?<eos> Nah, man.<eos> I say he's right.<eos> I say bring it on.<eos> Speaking of which, can we take a little walk?<eos> Got something to discuss.<eos> Sure.<eos> Remember, we don't know who to trust, so be careful.<eos> I will!
- Hurry up.<eos> We have to report back to the bosses and I'm dying to get home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, you don't have anything else to tell me?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Like we said, Lope de Vega is safe.<eos> But with his personality, I don't know if he'll make it to an old age.<eos> He will.
This is an irritating region.<eos> The food is vile, it's too hot, and there is no love for Rome or me!<eos> You shall change that.<eos> I thought perhaps...<eos> A statue.<eos> Yes.<eos> Statues of you across the empire, from Gaul to Egypt.<eos> Yes.<eos> We shall have one in this very room.<eos> We will.
Good idea.<eos> She's at the Deluxe Hotel.<eos> Careful, though.<eos> Kenneth is not Viktor.<eos> Apparently.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Finishing what we started.<eos> Does that hurt?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So will this.
No, you can't.<eos> You can't put him in that position.<eos> Did you ever regret it?<eos> One time.<eos> In '88, when you apprehended that bank robber all on your own before backup ever arrived.<eos> That was a clear case for the Medal for Valor. Eh.<eos> Now, every time you put on the uniform and I see a space where a medal should be, or a commendation bar, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I have regrets.<eos> I don't have regrets, Pop.<eos> Neither will Danny.
A bit of ancient wisdom for you to mull on your journey.<eos> Ah, here we go.<eos> You're late.<eos> Shall we do this or not?<eos> I'm curious why you requested this parley.<eos> I would think it would be obvious.<eos> Typically each side must prove that the other has something to lose by continuing the conflict.<eos> Allowing two British parties to bloody each other further wouldn't be good for either of us.<eos> I'm sorry, have you seen any blood?<eos> Nor will you.
Marcia.<eos> I thought about what you said about women our age being invisible, and I don't want to be invisible.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> I got a full-body wax.<eos> I'm hairless from my eyebrows to my ankles.<eos> Helen, what changed your mind?<eos> Your inspiring words and two vodkas.<eos> Poor Mamie Sue.<eos> She'll never know how freeing this is.<eos> Yes, she will.
Give it here.<eos> I didn't kill Sierra.<eos> Her name was Felicia.<eos> She slipped.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Someone slipping in the shower is an accident.<eos> Felicia was thrown out a 20-story window.<eos> She fought back tough, didn't she?<eos> If you say so.<eos> Actually, the medical examiner will.
Well, it's not your best day...<eos> I really am so sorry.<eos> Look, a mistake is like a bump in the road.<eos> One bump is not so bad.<eos> But if we keep making mistakes, eventually we change the shape of the road forever.<eos> Nick was actually really nice to me.<eos> Surprisingly decent.<eos> Well, that seems like a story worth telling.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> You will.
Uh, Jay would like a word, ma'am.<eos> (sighs) Bad news?<eos> The Iranians flatly rejected the prisoner swap.<eos> I thought they really want their spy back.<eos> They do, but not as much as they want to kill Mr. Ahmadi.<eos> Well, you did everything you could.<eos> Did I?<eos> Due respect, this isn't horseshoes, ma'am.<eos> Izad Ahmadi is going to suffer, unimaginably.<eos> Yes, he will.
Listen to me.<eos> You're writing checks your ass can't cash, all right?<eos> Now you're getting cold feet.<eos> Are you projecting?<eos> You seriously want to be a human?<eos> I want to be with Elena.<eos> And what did Stefan say?<eos> Do you honestly want to spend your last night as a single man debating my existential crisis?<eos> Damon, tell me you told your brother of 166 years that you're planning on becoming human.<eos> I will.
It's possible nobody survived this attack.<eos> The only bodies are out here.<eos> Jim had other safe houses on his radar.<eos> Maybe they escaped.<eos> Yeah, or they were taken.<eos> If they're alive, it won't be for long.<eos> The kinship still thinks that I'm a part of them, so why don't I head down to town hall, and see what I can find out.<eos> Okay, I'll go check out the other places the Resistance could be hiding.<eos> What if... somehow they know you're not one of them anymore?<eos> Hey, they won't.
Hey, don't shoot!<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't shoot my son!<eos> I think we just found our test subject.<eos> How long will it take for the cure to be ready?<eos> Not long at all, providing you stop hovering and let me extract the DNA from this hair.<eos> That too tight for you?<eos> Wait, scratch that.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You will later.
That's what we'll grow.<eos> A big part of my pitch to them was that they could maintain creative freedom.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That was smart.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I, um...<eos> I went by the house.<eos> They told me.<eos> We don't know who did it.<eos> You probably never will.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> "They know, and it'll all be over soon."<eos> That's what you said upstairs on the phone.<eos> So who were you talking to?<eos> Why should I answer when I can see you won't believe me?<eos> Through here.<eos> Anything like this ever happen on a flight before?<eos> Closest I came was a 90-year-old who had a heart attack.<eos> Luckily, that one had a happy ending.<eos> - This one will, too.
- No.<eos> I mean, you're free.<eos> Bates is free, the threat's gone away.<eos> I'd expect you to be wreathed in smiles but, instead, you seem rather cast down.<eos> Life's never simple is it, m'lady?<eos> You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.<eos> It's almost funny, really, given the service I once performed for you.<eos> You know, Mr Bates and I have always wanted children?<eos> And you'll have some now, I'm sure.<eos> No, I won't.
The sun is in the sky.<eos> Important safety tip.<eos> This isn't so bad.<eos> Those idiots.<eos> All you need's an umbrella.<eos> Ok. What to drive, what to drive.<eos> Ah, my chariot awaits.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> What if she doesn't let me back there?<eos> She will, okay?
I'vebeentrying to reconstruct the bullets that Dr. Wade pulled from the victims.<eos> What'd you learn?<eos> They were shattered.<eos> I'm talking Enterprise at the end of<eos> Search for Spock shattered.<eos> Which means...?<eos> Well, it means that like the Enterprise at the end of Voyage Home, I was able to reconstruct one of the bullets just enough to analyze it.<eos> But it doesn't matter, 'cause they're never gonna get a match in NIBIN anyway. You want to know why?<eos> As long as the answer doesn't include a Star Trek reference.<eos> Well, it won't now.
'It's okay, Ali.'<eos> I'll go get mommy. Shh. Shh.<eos> Mommy. Mommy.<eos> Do you know what makes me feel better?<eos> 'Come on, baby.<eos> I will help you.'<eos> Shh, Ali, it's okay.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> I love you, Charlie.<eos> And I always will.
The lights, they aren't randomly blinking on that one.<eos> It's a constant pattern.<eos> Are you making yourself comfortable?<eos> - Getting you out of here. - Whoa.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Let's go. Come on.<eos> Mona?<eos> I have to know how the story ends.<eos> Hanna, be careful.<eos> We will.
- But your face.<eos> Look, if you take a seat, when he's off the phone,<eos> - I'll let him know that you're here.<eos> - I wanted his support.<eos> I've basically just lost my job, but from the expression on your face, I think he's off having sex with Kate Parks again.<eos> You split with your husband.<eos> So, you can imagine something of what I'm feeling.<eos> I've known for a while.<eos> They have no idea.<eos> Well, they will now.
Neil said.<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> Just after we slept together.<eos> He was all right, actually.<eos> I wouldn't sell tickets but we had a good time.<eos> You wanted to get back at me.<eos> Is it sinking in?<eos> Have you felt it yet?<eos> No.<eos> But you will.
- So, where is he?<eos> - Right here.<eos> And good news ...<eos> I taught him to swim and hold his breath for the rest of his life.<eos> I can't wait to tell you about Jewish camp.<eos> Wait. You came back from Jewish camp?<eos> It'll feel so good to have Jeff back ... the real Jeff.<eos> Oh, god!<eos> I'll never forget you, alien Jeff!<eos> Actually, you will.
Mona, can you jump off?<eos> I'm at my computer.<eos> I have never written anything so fast in my life.<eos> It just came, like, pouring out of me.<eos> I posted it at 3 A.M. this morning.<eos> It's already gotten 10,000 views.<eos> I didn't put your name in it, but I did put your cell phone number.<eos> Your business is gonna take off.<eos> I don't have a business.<eos> You will now.
Where are you staying?<eos> Oh, with a girlfriend. Feels good to have my own space and support right now.<eos> This thing with your father, it's not going away.<eos> Stage four and it's everywhere.<eos> Cancer?<eos> Say cheese.<eos> I posted it at 3:00am this morning.<eos> Your business is gonna take off.<eos> I don't have a business.<eos> You will now.
-I gotta go.<eos> -Great.<eos> For? Angelo's birthday dinner.<eos> Oh. Right.<eos> Sorry, I can't.<eos> -I have my ride-along.<eos> -Tonight? You can't reschedule?<eos> I have to get it done before spring break.<eos> I'm sure they would understand.<eos> No, they won't.
I'm busy.<eos> Well, I wanted to say I'm not sorry, and I'm running away with Ponzi.<eos> No, Lillian, don't do it.<eos> I know he's handsome, and he's thoughtful, and he could surely make you happier than you are here, but...<eos> I can't think of a "but."<eos> You should go.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm happy for you.<eos> - Go!<eos> - I will!
We have a lot of work to do.<eos> Harlan.<eos> Annie. Mm. Um, Billy.<eos> You know, we've all heard all the stories, you know, about David and Goliath and how the upstart takes down the king.<eos> Do you know why we like those stories?<eos> Because they're fairy tales.<eos> So, good luck to you.<eos> 'Cause if you're coming after me, son, you're gonna need it.<eos> Well, may the best man win.<eos> Oh, I will.
I am moving on.<eos> To a place with a doorman.<eos> And there's nothing you can do about it.<eos> You know, it's funny.<eos> When you say there's nothing I can do, I always find something to do.<eos> - Like a flight attendant.<eos> - Oh, this is not over.<eos> Said the man walking away.<eos> You will not get the last word.<eos> Yes, I will.
That's why you're here.<eos> The people who reached out to my son, they're reaching out to others.<eos> They're building cells on our soil.<eos> We need to infiltrate them, poison their network.<eos> I have a plan, but I need you.<eos> I need you both.<eos> I need you to work together as one.<eos> I let my emotions get in the way of my duty.<eos> It will never happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
- You've changed.<eos> - What?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Yeah, prove it.<eos> I got a new party drug called Stacey.<eos> - Let's take it.<eos> - Peter, I'm 27 years old and I have a baby.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I understand but come on, let's party.<eos> Okay, okay, we will.
I should kick your ass.<eos> If that'll make us square, you have my blessing.<eos> Nah, man, I want nothing to do with you.<eos> You're a maniac.<eos> What can I get for you?<eos> Uh, nothing.<eos> You should probably order something.<eos> - I'd recommend this...<eos> - Fine.<eos> I'll...
Yeah, Rita helped me get a waiver, since, you know, I have a record.<eos> All I gotta do now is pass the physical, and I start basic training.<eos> Good luck, girl.<eos> You think this place is strict.<eos> Yeah, but in the army I get to shoot an M32 grenade launcher.<eos> Ooh, maybe I should join the army, get one of those hot Navy Seals.<eos> Yeah, you'll last all of five minutes in basic training.<eos> Shut your pie hole.<eos> So what if this social worker finds out you've been seeing Brandon the whole time you were at G.U.?<eos> She won't.
The brutes who bind me?<eos> What makes them friendly?<eos> Their tempers are nothing I tend to.<eos> You are very wise.<eos> And such a kind face.<eos> May I have a better look?<eos> Like an angel.<eos> No.<eos> Although I will have wings someday.<eos> Of course you will...
He won't "chat".<eos> Unless you're talking about mathematics, the discussion will be a waste of time.<eos> Is it possible that Alex would have confided in him?<eos> - That's a very serious allegation.<eos> - I'm just thinking aloud.<eos> Marcus admired Alex.<eos> On some level, he might have envied him, but... .. I can't believe he'd want to harm him.<eos> Could you arrange a meeting?<eos> So you do have something specific you're going to speak to him about?<eos> - We will.
Now turn around and keep walking.<eos> You know, everyone had this place wrong.<eos> It isn't death.<eos> It's a new beginning.<eos> Malick was right.<eos> This is all meant to be.<eos> And the fact that you followed me here, that we're in this together, that just confirms the fact that I am part of a grand plan.<eos> I see that now.<eos> I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You will.
I think I was just so furious with dad.<eos> For leaving me with mom, for missing birthdays, for missing every single play I did, for missing graduation, for... basically sucking.<eos> Anyway...<eos> I know it's unforgivable.<eos> But I'm glad I at least had the chance to tell you how sorry I am.<eos> Pretty. What is it?<eos> Oh, it's, uh... a diner where we had our first date.<eos> I had a painter friend of ours make it for Dana.<eos> I hope she likes it.<eos> She will.
Give me your blood.<eos> You would need too much.<eos> We would both die.<eos> You want revenge, don't you?<eos> Enough.<eos> Stop.<eos> You have too much of me.<eos> Now we'll both die.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
And Otto?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Have you seen Jonas, by any chance?<eos> No. Why?<eos> I was... just wondering if he'd asked about me or... wanted to know where I was.<eos> Should I tell him about your situation?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> I'll just get Numan, then, hmm?<eos> And you-- you be careful.<eos> I will.
I've got no one else to turn to.<eos> I need this to end.<eos> I had a life.<eos> I want it back.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> On one condition.<eos> Name it.<eos> None of the hacked documents see the light of day ever again.<eos> They won't.
Lily said Julian had found me robbed and beaten on the street.<eos> She believed him of course, and she healed me with her blood.<eos> Julian knew I could never tell Lily what he had done because that would also have exposed my lies.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She never would have forgiven me for having an affair with her son.<eos> I didn't want to live under Julian's thumb, so that night as we crossed the Atlantic, I drew myself a bath, laced my tea with laudanum, and went quietly to sleep...<eos> But I died with Lily's blood in my system...<eos> And by virtue of pure happenstance, I became the first heretic.<eos> You don't know how sorry I am... About everything.<eos> Maybe you never will.
The human whose name is written in this note shall die.<eos> If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. Once the victim's name, cause, or situation of death have been written in the Death Note, this death will still take place even if that Death Note or the part of the Note in which it has been written is destroyed, for example, burned into ashes, before the stated time of death.<eos> will still
All right, checking in?<eos> Yes.<eos> One night only.<eos> _<eos> There's a kid called Beslan.<eos> Used to work for Tamir.<eos> He moved Kate out of Paris.<eos> If she was moved again, he probably helped.<eos> What if we never find her?<eos> We will.
Jakes, just...<eos> Don't do this, man.<eos> Don't push me, Johnny.<eos> God damn it, Jakes.<eos> Don't do this, man.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Don't do it, man.<eos> Please, man.<eos> I love you, Johnny.<eos> Always will, man.
Sleepwalking?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sleepwalking. And saying a few things.<eos> What?<eos> I could not understand well, you know?<eos> I know.<eos> Check again there.<eos> Dimas...<eos> Boss, we did not find anything yet.<eos> But we will.
Unless, of course, she's reminding me that she has a boyfriend.<eos> Brock thinks...<eos> Brock says...<eos> Brock did...<eos> Brock...<eos> Brock...<eos> Brock...<eos> So, if she's doubling down on Brock, then I might as well be somewhere else.<eos> But, hey, you know, at least you and Roxie will have each other.<eos> Nah, no we won't.
Everyone does.<eos> I am the god of earthquakes!<eos> Tremble before me! Oww. Wow.<eos> If that doesn't tell me to go to Italy, I don't know what does.<eos> If this thing with Audrey makes you feel like you need to leave, then maybe you should.<eos> I mean, I don't like it, but I support you.<eos> It's your decision.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I really hope you remember how awesome I've been today.<eos> I will.
What's with all the Band-Aids?<eos> Paper cuts.<eos> Sitting in my cell all day, doing legal research on my case, unfortunately I hit a brick wall.<eos> Not a lot of loopholes when you kill your wife's lover and then you try to kill your best detective.<eos> - I'll never stop regretting that.<eos> - Good.<eos> Hauser, time's up.<eos> Is that it?<eos> I didn't get anything.<eos> You will, hotshot.

I once saw a clip of Supergirl in the news.<eos> She flew someone over there to the hospital.<eos> Unless you know where she is, we're your dad's only hope.<eos> -Damn it.<eos> It's a venous bleed.<eos> -What?<eos> He must've lacerated another vessel.<eos> So we find... We find the vessel,<eos> He's got 100,000 miles of vessels.<eos> We'll never
Robert, you accuse of me of such terrible things.<eos> - Why would I ever...?<eos> - Because you know.<eos> Admit it, Amy.<eos> I don't know anything, truly I don't.<eos> I love her.<eos> Don't.<eos> Please.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
I thought you guys weren't taking it seriously.<eos> Show me what you got.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Dave, you do that again, and you're gonna get a punch.<eos> Hit it, Walter. ♪ Mr. Boombastic ♪ ♪ What you want is some boombastic ♪<eos> No girl is gonna want to dance with you if you're doing that.<eos> Yeah, they will.
CPD!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't move.<eos> You're making a big mistake.<eos> I got it.<eos> State's attorney is gonna have to figure out your charges.<eos> I mean, if you're lucky, he'll, uh, he'll drop the murder charge down to manslaughter since you're, you know, following the orders of a guy who's mentally unstable.<eos> You interfered with an operation sanctioned by the CIA.<eos> If you're CIA... how come nobody's come here to get you out?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> They will.
I'll let you know.<eos> OK.<eos> You take care.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of Yazgi and yourself...<eos> Do you really mean it?<eos> OK.<eos> I didn't say it.<eos> Won't you come in?<eos> No, I won't.
Why don't I walk over?<eos> Pay my respects.<eos> I understand your concern, Sergeant, but Child Services is a city agency.<eos> There are protocols.<eos> A caseworker lied about his visits.<eos> A supervisor signed off on false reports.<eos> Child Services is responsible for Keisha's death.<eos> The city has a Department of Investigation.<eos> If they decide something criminal has transpired...<eos> - Which they won't.
No way.<eos> No. I mean, from here.<eos> All this.<eos> The hunting life.<eos> Do you?<eos> Hmm. Ever think... That maybe you wanna go to school?<eos> Make some friends?<eos> But I have you.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> But one day you won't.
And help spread body-shaming awareness!<eos> I think you can give him a little of your time!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Find everything you needed today?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98.<eos> Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?<eos> Yes, I would like to give a dollar.<eos> You want to give a dollar?<eos> Yes, I will.
!<eos> Aah!<eos> Who wants waffles?<eos> Kids, come on down!<eos> Here you go, Murray.<eos> Oops.<eos> I almost forgot ...<eos> I need to get the kids' lunch money.<eos> Mom's got to stop wearing her old Halloween costume.<eos> She won't.
Do I have to challenge you to another dance-off?<eos> Silence, Ravager.<eos> Guardian of the Galaxy, dude.<eos> You gave us our name.<eos> I mean, it was sarcastic when you said it. But still.<eos> Hey!<eos> Now you're making me mad.<eos> Get him, Drax.<eos> I have no quarrel with this man.<eos> But you will.
No. I'll take my medication first.<eos> Weigh in.<eos> How can a human being have no mercy?<eos> - No mercy...<eos> - Mr. Coach.<eos> Mr. Coach.<eos> How could you gain 1.8 kilograms in one day?<eos> I drank too much water yesterday.<eos> People told me that if I lost more weight, I'd die.<eos> No, you won't.
- Yeah.<eos> One, You're on trash duty the rest of the month.<eos> Including shining that outside dumpster.<eos> Two, Another stunt like that on shift and you're out of here.<eos> No questions.<eos> Yes. I mean, sorry, Chief.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I apologize.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> - It won't.
What are you a psycho?<eos> Didn't you hear me?<eos> No!<eos> Quit if you want.<eos> Here's the waiting list!<eos> Wanna work or not?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Now!<eos> I'll work!<eos> Of course you will!
An exclusive!<eos> Listen up.<eos> Do whatever you can to find out how the two fools fell apart.<eos> - Got that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Heard from Sun-woo?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Always when we're busy...<eos> - Tell him to come now.<eos> - He won't.
Last week, we saw the end to Makoto and Minori's relationship.<eos> But the next time we decide to hang out...<eos> MAKOTO HASEGAWA, 21 YEARS OLD MINORI NAKADA, 21 YEARS OLD ...it's not intended to mean I'm responding to your feelings toward me.<eos> Minori clearly told him she wasn't interested.<eos> -She was very clear.<eos> -As to why?<eos> Minori and Tatsuya's relationship is making steady progress.<eos> And they made plans to see each other at their favorite places.<eos> -That's right, and we'll get to see that.<eos> -We will.
Good game, kid.<eos> That was a hell of a catch.<eos> All right. Thanks.<eos> Hey. No ass-touching off the field, Joe.<eos> I knew you were full of shit from the moment I met you.<eos> I know this is gonna sound crazy, but if you're ever in the mood, I know a place that has great burritos.<eos> You just ruined my sister's wedding and you're asking me out on a date?<eos> Yes, I am. Can I call you?<eos> - Yeah, you better.<eos> - I will.
Mom?<eos> I'm not... I'm not ready to hear this.<eos> When I met your father we were teenagers and I never expected to be with anyone else.<eos> Never.<eos> But then one day, things change, and it's over.<eos> And I'd be lying if I said it doesn't still hurt.<eos> It does.<eos> But it's like a broken bone that's healed... and still throbs every time it rains.<eos> It doesn't feel like this is ever gonna go away though.<eos> Sweetie, it will. It will.
Saul got up and, although his eyes were opened, he could see nothing.<eos> He was led to Damascus...<eos> Please eat.<eos> No.<eos> In Damascus, there was a disciple named Ananius...<eos> It's me, Raphaëlle.<eos> You must eat.<eos> No, sister. The journey would worsen your condition<eos> - and you might... - I'll die in the end.<eos> As will we all.
Ma'am are we talking about a dog, or a person?<eos> A person!<eos> She won't even eat dog food.<eos> Tell me what kind of dog that is?<eos> Spoiled.<eos> I think I'm going to be sick.<eos> Oh.<eos> If he wants money...<eos> why hasn't he contacted us?<eos> He will.
Go call Eddie.<eos> Look, Mom and Dad told me about how I freaked out this morning.<eos> But you helped me, calmed me down and kept me from hurting myself.<eos> I don't even know what happened, but you helped me, so, thank you.<eos> I owe you one.<eos> Do you know what happened to me?<eos> You were possessed by a berserker ghoul.<eos> Right, I said I owe you one. That doesn't mean I have to believe your stories about ghosts and magic.<eos> You know I don't believe that stuff.<eos> Well, maybe someday you will.
Is my baby okay?<eos> You'll see the judge in about an hour.<eos> Against the wall.<eos> - Where is Carl Mørck?<eos> - He did not come.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Face to the wall.<eos> There is a bridge half an hour away.<eos> But if it goes wrong ...<eos> - It won't.
Or, um...<eos> When... When someone you love...<eos> Is subtracted from you...<eos> Then it feels like, you know, that your value is less than it was.<eos> Does that make sense?<eos> Why did he have to go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - It just doesn't make sense.<eos> - I know.<eos> It never will.
The last thing I need right now is you.<eos> These two uniforms are doing you a favour.<eos> So am I. I live here, Steve!<eos> Kate, move.<eos> All right?<eos> I've got her, mate.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I just wanted to see my son.<eos> You will.
This is my boyfriend Jon.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, um, are you in video games too?<eos> Uh, no, I cut hair, actually.<eos> Oh, right, like for a living?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, for now.<eos> But eventually you'll wanna, you know...<eos> Get your own place or something, right?<eos> I will?
I'm me.<eos> But all that crap you said to him, that's gonna follow him around school.<eos> You know, because you're you.<eos> Are you gonna be a bitch about me eating pickles in here?<eos> Test results for the patient Carl Powell show an aggressive resurgence, of malignant cells in the prostate and surrounding tissue...<eos> You talking about Carl?<eos> Yeah,<eos> Is he okay?<eos> He's not responding, to treatment.<eos> But he... he will, right?
I have the oil, but we have gasoline tanks.<eos> We must be a little better friends.<eos> Do I look I'll suffer without your fuel tanks?<eos> - Am I missing something?<eos> - No, you guys don't lack anything.<eos> But at our house we are the best.<eos> You know this.<eos> For me it's enough that you just consider it.<eos> Would you consider it?<eos> Yes, I will.
That is unfortunate.<eos> No, it's not. You're supposed to share your dreams with your friends.<eos> Okay, fine, I'll share.<eos> I do want what you guys have, okay?<eos> Can I jump off this roof now?<eos> Kate, you're gonna have a wedding.<eos> And it's gonna be beautiful.<eos> Yeah, but I don't even have...<eos> I don't know if I'll ever...<eos> You will.
I know, but there is more than one way to get a doctor to see you.<eos> I did some Internet digging, and he's looking for a girlfriend so I joined J-Date.<eos> That's funny, you don't look j-ish.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I'm studying.<eos> Don't let this goyishe punim fool you.<eos> I've got shpilkes in the finitin.<eos> Oy vey.<eos> This is not going to end well.<eos> Yes, it will.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're not fine.<eos> You need some tea.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> I still feel the pain.<eos> And you will.
God!<eos> Stop it!<eos> God, i don't have cancer!<eos> You kids want me to have cancer?<eos> All right.<eos> So...<eos> I'm selling the house.<eos> I'm done with the house.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> - No, you won't.
You're chipper.<eos> That must mean Damon is dead.<eos> Not quite.<eos> In fact, he continues to be the bane of my existence, but...<eos> Stefan and I had a moment. Heh.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll keep the details to myself, but it definitely reaffirmed his feelings for Elena, I.E. me. Heh.<eos> So, uh, it's only a matter of time.<eos> Sounds like you're going to get everything you want.<eos> Of course I will.
Not even two hours, and you're completely drunk?<eos> He said "completely drunk". Pull yourself together.<eos> Or you'll tell Charlotte- Excuse me.<eos> – The music is magical, is it not?<eos> – Indeed.<eos> Are you as musical as your brother, Miss Gray?<eos> I'd be totally happy to sing, totally!<eos> Ladies and Gentlemen:<eos> Young Miss Gray desires to sing something for us!<eos> – You will not! - Why not?
Here, put this on your belt.<eos> It's gonna get dark soon.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Farther.<eos> Come on.<eos> Is everybody dead?<eos> They're gonna hear her.<eos> We shouldn't be out here.<eos> We'll find a safe place soon.<eos> We will.
Does he look dead to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> No, he's asleep.<eos> He is blissfully asleep.<eos> He's so cute, right?<eos> When he's sleeping, he's perfect.<eos> I loved playing house with you today.<eos> I don't know if I'm ever gonna have that.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Just by bringing us here, my brother and I are already dead.<eos> We're just about the only people who can help you now.<eos> No.<eos> You have no idea who you're dealing with.<eos> You people are amateurs compared to him.<eos> Who?<eos> Give us a name.<eos> He will bury you.<eos> Well, we'll see about that.<eos> Yeah, you will.
This is the last position to fall.<eos> Finley, I think we do understand the threat.<eos> This has to be Gibson.<eos> Generator is up.<eos> We have power.<eos> How long will we be blind?<eos> A day.<eos> We'll have no communications.<eos> We'll have no access to surveillance systems.<eos> But neither will our enemies.
That's cheap.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What was your appointment?<eos> If you must know, I was going to go to a class at the gym.<eos> I was trying to stay in shape in case I go back to dancing.<eos> Chorus like we talked about.<eos> I blew 50 bucks not going.<eos> I'm sorry. I'll try to make soccer tomorrow.<eos> I will, Molly.
Where's Lolani?<eos> Isn't it lovely?<eos> Dr. McKennah gave it to me.<eos> She said it's what ladies wear on other exotic worlds.<eos> I feel almost like a princess.<eos> You look lovely...<eos> Captain, I'm sorry for what I did.<eos> Even though I'm desperate to remain free. I shouldn't have manipulated your crewman.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No it won't.
And that's what I did.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad you did.<eos> Now, when that happened, were you able to scratch his face or... ?<eos> It got my thumbnail inside his eye, his right eye... deep.<eos> He screamed, and he fell off of me, and... and that's when I ran.<eos> You have been amazing.<eos> He didn't break me.<eos> I want him to know that.<eos> He will.
- I love you, too.<eos> Is opening up a new office...<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> And I have been chosen to open up the new office in Hong Kong...<eos> I love you.<eos> Wait, are you moving to Hong Hong?<eos> I love you.<eos> - Will you get out of here?<eos> - Yes, yes, I will. (Laughs)
Dash, your computer, those e-mails from Kyle Hutton!<eos> They're gone.<eos> I wiped the hard drive.<eos> It's totally clean.<eos> The... the thing is...<eos> I need you to know that no matter what happens, I'll keep you out of it.<eos> You can't keep me out of it, Dash.<eos> I helped you.<eos> No one knows that.<eos> And no one ever will.

- Excuse me?<eos> No, no, that's it, right?<eos> That's why you're with me.<eos> I'm this hot-headed alkie that you, uh, seduced to fulfill your savior complex.<eos> What... what are you talking about? !<eos> I'm talking about you latching on to people that got problems so you can feel better about yourself!<eos> That's what I'm talking about!<eos> You can leave now.<eos> You're right. I can.<eos> I will.
Let her through.<eos> Well, if he didn't hate us before, he does now.<eos> Who cares?<eos> How's Finn?<eos> Alive.<eos> His people will care.<eos> How long until they figure out where he is?<eos> And what happens when they do?<eos> I mean, when they come looking for him?<eos> They will, Bellamy.
She could've helped us from her cell, couldn't she?<eos> Given us the names, information we needed?<eos> Why bring her here?<eos> As per her request; obviously, part of the deal she just struck with your superiors.<eos> The building that you're keeping her in, it might not be a prison, but it did seem adequately secure.<eos> She'd have a much easier time trying to escape whilst out and about, no?<eos> The bottom line is that she has cashed in some big chips to be an active participant.<eos> Her preference is to work with you.<eos> If you don't take her...<eos> FBI will.
You know nothing.<eos> You are the last of your people.<eos> Then we are the same, eh?<eos> All I want is Wirepa.<eos> We need to do something.<eos> Like what?<eos> We can't catch them now.<eos> We are surrounded by your ancestors.<eos> They will slow Wirepa down.<eos> I won't.
I have a good imagination.<eos> Now, where is she?<eos> You tell me where she is, or I will board up this door and this room becomes<eos> - your eternity!<eos> - Do what you may.<eos> I fear you less than the people I work for.<eos> I know all about Ilaria.<eos> When they find you, they will force you to watch as they kill everyone you love.<eos> Not if I find them first.<eos> You will not.
Yes, they've been killing women for decades at La Chimere.<eos> They use them to have babies So that they can kill the babies for their blood Because they need the blood of the innocents<eos> In order for them to stay young. That's how they stay young.<eos> They've stayed young.<eos> It makes complete sense.<eos> Complete sense the whole time, And they want my child.<eos> Nobody is going to touch your baby.<eos> No, they're not gonna have my baby.<eos> No, I promise you.<eos> - They will not.
It breaks my heart how badly you want to believe that.<eos> We'll see you guys later.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Riding our bikes to Xander's.<eos> What are you doing there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hanging out.<eos> Sounds fun.<eos> Wear your helmets.<eos> We will.
Patient in hypovolemic shock.<eos> Get me four units of O-neg, stat!<eos> I need an O.R.!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Uh... like crap.<eos> But you're going to be okay.<eos> Do they know who I am?<eos> They will.
Yeah, I've totally cut back. And not that it's any of your beeswax, but I've also cut back on, you know...<eos> On what?<eos> Sterling, with you that could almost literally be anything.<eos> Anonymous sex! If you must know!<eos> Ew!<eos> Beechcraft, please identify.<eos> Guys.<eos> Really? I've totally, relatively cleaned up my act.<eos> So maybe keep that in mind when you're choosing godparents?<eos> I will, Archer.
- I just thought things were going so well, why not?<eos> Things are going well.<eos> They are.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's because I'm really good at this part, the beginnings of relationships, but eventually I always find a way to... destroy them.<eos> The past is the past, Wallace.<eos> Yeah, 10, 20 years ago, I'd have told myself that too, but I've seen the pain I've caused.<eos> Two marriages, a stepson who barely wants anything to do with me.<eos> I got a lot of baggage, Donna, and I can't put you through that.<eos> I won't.
The cramps, the sweats, the craving for it?<eos> The worst of the pain will be over in a few days.<eos> As to the craving, that may never leave.<eos> I'm not sure I can stand it.<eos> For Kate, you can stand it.<eos> He knows.<eos> He can endure anything except betrayal, Charlie.<eos> If he knew, we'd be already dead.<eos> So he does not know.<eos> He never will.
Hi.<eos> Ben...<eos> Wow.<eos> Are... are you OK?<eos> Yeah, I'm... I'm fine, thanks.<eos> They're really putting you through the wringer, aren't they?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you seen Tim about that eye?<eos> He's home.<eos> Oh, yeah, I... I will.
Scott!<eos> Scott!<eos> Seth.<eos> Plan "B."<eos> Hey!<eos> Now, that's one for the books.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to find Scott.<eos> We will, honey.
Scott!<eos> Seth.<eos> Plan "B."<eos> Hey!<eos> Now, that's one for the books.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to find Scott.<eos> We will, honey.<eos> We will.
But before I go, I need to talk to you, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Come here.<eos> Bo, do not use your ability, no matter how much you're tempted.<eos> If you do, those people will find you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> You understand, Mr. Tate?<eos> Yeah, got it.<eos> Be careful, Channing.<eos> Of course I will, sweetie.
2000 per pot.<eos> 2000 per pot?<eos> Didn't I tell you he's a very honest officer?<eos> Once he gets the money the job's yours. Now I want to get a bigger contract.<eos> So I've to pay commission for that.<eos> So I've applied for a loan in the bank.<eos> What?<eos> Banks give loan for paying bribe.<eos> If we bribe the bank then why won't they give us a loan for paying bribe?<eos> Of course they will.
But don't look too carefully 'cause you're not gonna find it in the book.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Good. I got to grab something from my office.<eos> Scrub up, Maggie.<eos> You having fun yet?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mimi.<eos> The good news is your head C.T. and all your other tests have come back clear.<eos> And the bad news is you still don't know what's wrong with me.<eos> We will.
You're dragging this out.<eos> You have to wait for final word on Bash's legitimization anyway.<eos> Why kill me if the line of succession reverts to my sons?<eos> You're a treasonous adulterer.<eos> Then I'll continue with the seating chart.<eos> Mary, the feast will be held there.<eos> Choose your place of honor.<eos> You are going to die.<eos> What they write about your execution won't matter.<eos> It will to my children.
-We're good, we're good.<eos> Let's get in there and check it out.<eos> Molotov cocktails.<eos> We could throw them at them, while we make a retreat.<eos> You know, Bryce died two years ago.<eos> Since then, I thought a lot about how I might die.<eos> Not one time did I ever consider killer fish.<eos> We're gonna make it through this.<eos> Kerri didn't, the old man on the boat didn't.<eos> But we will.
Do you have any idea what I have had to do for you?<eos> I do.<eos> There's not a day goes by I don't think about it.<eos> - Well, I don't think you do, or else you wouldn't be having this conversation...<eos> Boyd.<eos> ...with me...<eos> Boyd.<eos> ...right now.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will, okay?
- all tense and shit.<eos> Now, Mexico? - Huh.<eos> Mexico.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Took care of business.<eos> - Let's have a drink, man, toast our goodbye.<eos> - Well, I only drink with people that I like or I pretend to like, but I will indulge in one of these cigarettes.<eos> - Shit, I didn't even know you smoked.<eos> - Well, there's a lot of things you don't know about me, Darryl Crowe Jr.<eos> - And you never will.
Yeah, it was fun.<eos> Hey, you wanna grab a drink?<eos> Oh, shoot, I would, but I'm meeting Vivian for that romantic pig colon dinner.<eos> Hey, rosa.<eos> I want to apologize.<eos> I haven't been much fun to hang out with over the last year or so on account of all the asking you out and staring at you from point-blank range.<eos> Yeah, you were a real weirdo.<eos> Mm-hmm. But you're pretty cool now that you're in love with someone else.<eos> Have a nice dinner.<eos> Oh, we will.
You're going to be fine.<eos> The child is dead?<eos> Yes.<eos> A boy?<eos> What? What?<eos> We won't be able to have another.<eos> - Get rid of it! - What? What?<eos> - Get rid of it!<eos> Get rid of it now!<eos> - Okay, I'll...
Please.<eos> OK, please, don't get upset. All right?<eos> Not tonight.<eos> OK?<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look, it's crazy, it's ridiculous, it's, you know.<eos> I think we're both completely exhausted and I think we're both in need of some sleep and I think we should just forget tonight ever happened.<eos> All right.<eos> OK. We will.
Oh, I bet you'd like to know.<eos> Just get the hell away from me, all right?<eos> I never want to see you...<eos> or hear you or talk to you.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Discharge on 27?<eos> Uh, that is correct.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Discharged with further investigation in case we find any additional holes in your alibi.<eos> You won't.
It's plans to blow up the sun!<eos> Stan, I think that guy is touching himself to the pillow fight.<eos> Oh, who me?<eos> No, I'm just thinking about the sun blowing up.<eos> It's gonna be so... bright.<eos> Thanks for walking me home.<eos> I would have walked you home but I didn't want to.<eos> I totally get it.<eos> So, I'll meet you at the dance tonight?<eos> Yeah, you will.
If she can prove it, I'll come and find you.<eos> And if she can't?<eos> I'll find Vernon Greg.<eos> And then what?<eos> I'll kill him.<eos> You'd hang.<eos> Go to Lancaster.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> And I never will.
Couldn't find any takers for Chicago?<eos> Everybody turned me down but Larry.<eos> - Ouch.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, cheer up.<eos> You got a new job, new challenges, all that crap you like.<eos> Man, I'm gonna miss Pawnee.<eos> I wish I could stay, you know, keep an eye on it, raise my kids here.<eos> And let's be honest, am I ever gonna find a better breakfast than JJ's Diner?<eos> You will not, no.
Bastard.<eos> She's got quite a slap.<eos> Why won't it work for me?<eos> You losers.<eos> You put the back of your hand.<eos> Then what?<eos> If the girl slaps you...<eos> Slap me.<eos> - It won't work.<eos> - It won't?
Oh, you should probably clear it with Pete.<eos> Mom, I...<eos> I am going to the supermarket, all right?<eos> That's all.<eos> I've been going to the supermarket for millions of years.<eos> Well, let me go for you.<eos> No, I want to go by myself.<eos> But just give me your list...<eos> No, mom!<eos> Will you...
Coming in for the landing!<eos> You'll never find love!<eos> Is that how you all feel?<eos> You'd have to read it back to me.<eos> Brett?<eos> Hey, guys, for a penis name, what do you think of Duncan?<eos> It's Scottish for "brown warrior."<eos> Listen, if you had any guts at all, you would try to fix this thing with Sabrina.<eos> But guess what?<eos> You won't.
Joe Bey said he wanted to take it for a test-drive, use it on a few animals, see how fast it worked.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Do me a favor and catch your partner up.<eos> I called him, but he didn't pick up.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> He went to the boxing gym the second we got home.<eos> I think he needed some time for himself.<eos> Well, he and I are still gonna have a little talk about that stunt he pulled today.<eos> Feel free to tell him I said so.<eos> Okay, I will.
Listen, we only got one shot at this, okay?<eos> And we can't afford to risk it just because someone wants to fuel their image. So do me a favor, help me out.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, I think we should let Dale go up. I can handle this.<eos> I know, but it's dangerous and Barbie is more experienced.<eos> Jim, the town's looking to you right now, okay?<eos> They need a leader, not a martyr.<eos> - If anything happens up there, then...<eos> - It won't.
I've got you, man, okay?<eos> You'll be all right.<eos> Dougal, is it bad?<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> It wasn't spurting, which meant the femoral artery wasn't cut.<eos> So there was a good chance I could stop the bleeding at the thigh.<eos> Will I lose my leg?<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
Thank you, Ram, for that, uh, wonderfully graphic tribute.<eos> And now, Victoria's dear friend Elka Ostrovsky would like to say a few words.<eos> Victoria Chase may have been vain, bubble-headed, and crazy...<eos> But?<eos> There's no "but."<eos> Victoria was more than a friend to me.<eos> She was a sister.<eos> Loyal and generous and wiser than she ever got credit for.<eos> I'll miss you forever, my darling.<eos> We all will.
You won't need a seat filler if you have to go to the bathroom during the ceremony.<eos> - [Laughs] You're very funny.<eos> - Now what am I gonna do?<eos> - You're gonna celebrate. We're all gonna celebrate!<eos> Honey, you could win an Oscar!<eos> And, elka, you could win an election!<eos> - You know what, Melanie is right.<eos> - She's beautiful too.<eos> Somebody else talk.<eos> - Okay, I will.
I don't think you'd ever turn your back on Harvey.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Harvey wanted you to stay.<eos> I wanted you to leave.<eos> You chose to stay.<eos> So your priorities, they seem pretty clear to me.<eos> - Rachel, come on.<eos> - Hey, wait a minute if they charge you with something, they're gonna go through your records, and they are going to realize that you're not a member of the bar.<eos> No, they won't.
Mmm. Possibly.<eos> I dunno.<eos> Which, why would you?<eos> It isn't like it'd bring her back, is it?<eos> Don't let yourself get obsessed with it.<eos> Catherine.<eos> He's low-life.<eos> He's scum.<eos> He'll get what's coming to him one day.<eos> He just will.
I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> He was drunk, they're fighting.<eos> Most he gets is manslaughter for the brother.<eos> And Johnny's a fighter.<eos> Bobby may walk on self-defense.<eos> AL: Which is why we need to get him for the trainer.<eos> Carrie have enough?<eos> She will.
Oh, please. You just bought five hundred copies of a magazine you're not even in!<eos> Admit it.<eos> You both wanted to get on that list.<eos> - For him!<eos> - What about her?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Gabi!<eos> At least when Josh fires you, you can add pimp to your resume.<eos> - Why isn't she coming over here?<eos> - Oh, she will.
She made it happen.<eos> With a little help from you.<eos> Actually, she ignored any of my advice.<eos> Oh, well... that is certainly very sad.<eos> Cos if she could smell a rat in you, she certainly was someone to believe in.<eos> What's this?<eos> Should I know?<eos> Should I start talking to IA?<eos> I don't believe we have an IA in the Secret Service...<eos> We will after this.
She keeps talking about her mother being infirm.<eos> But I'm infirm. Why doesn't she think about that?<eos> You're as infirm as Windsor Castle.<eos> And why does Spratt mind, particularly?<eos> Because he likes things to be just so.<eos> But also, I think Collins was his creature and does his bidding without qualm or query.<eos> He can't be sure of that in the next one.<eos> Well, never having had a lady's maid, it's not a challenge I've had to tussle with.<eos> But you'll come on Thursday?<eos> I will.
It's labour we require up at the castle!<eos> Labour and gold, not old men and their worthless baubles.<eos> This will be a great help, Master Quayle, believe me.<eos> Newcomer to Sherwood, are we?<eos> Yes, my Lord.<eos> You may also prove useful.<eos> Bring her.<eos> Your days are numbered, you cur!<eos> You shall live to regret that.<eos> Actually, no... ..you won't.
- Your girls used Quickride.<eos> We just busted another house that used Quickride.<eos> It's the same question, Little Tino.<eos> Who's in charge here?<eos> I'm already in jail for rape and murder.<eos> You can get me off from that?<eos> I'm here, aren't I?<eos> You cooperate, Witness Protection is one phone call away.<eos> If I talk, everybody's gonna know it's coming from me.<eos> No, they won't.
Somebody hurt her.<eos> You were with her.<eos> We got eyewitnesses, son.<eos> I-I was with her, but I left.<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> Wandering.<eos> Can anybody verify that?<eos> You said I could see my father.<eos> That you, honey?<eos> And you will.
I've had an idea about her name.<eos> Well, you've got a Lee and a Ryan, so... we'll have to call her Eric... after Cantona. JOANNE LAUGHS<eos> Scarlet.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you get it?<eos> That way she'll always be a red.<eos> Scarlet.<eos> I like Scarlet.<eos> I'd love for your kids to meet her one day.<eos> They will, one day.
Helen, please don't. - It's true.<eos> It is not true.<eos> What got him killed was the greed of another man.<eos> It is not our fault that he died.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> But will the foreman please remain standing?<eos> Do you have an update for the court on this fine Saturday?<eos> Yes, Your Honor, I'm afraid we still haven't reached a verdict.<eos> And will you?
- Yasumoto? - He has the resources to take care of the baby.<eos> He knows how important this is.<eos> Yeah, because I asked him to help, but this is not what I had in mind.<eos> I need to find him, John, and I can't do it by myself.<eos> I just wish you'd come to me instead.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just didn't have the time.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I will.
- Can I ask you a personal question?<eos> - Yeah, come on.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> Yes.<eos> He is nice.<eos> Nice?<eos> Johnny ... You live in the richest countries.<eos> - You can allow yourself to have feelings.<eos> What happens if you meet one ... you really fall for?<eos> Sorry, I'll just ...
You must have rolled right into the wrong neighborhood.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - What are we doing?<eos> - Let's see ...<eos> - Oh, lord ...<eos> - Oh, lord ...<eos> It seems like these girls are doing a kind of blackmail.<eos> They filmed you while you were doing things that may be illegal in Norway.<eos> Wha will they?
One can only enter through Paradise.<eos> A secret order formed at the time of the First Crusade.<eos> The Old Man has always lived among them... granting access to Paradise.<eos> Is he a magic man?<eos> He is a holy man.<eos> I think you trade in black market fables.<eos> That's what I think.<eos> You have a much more genteel personality than your friend.<eos> It takes time... but he will soften... eventually.<eos> I will not.
No.<eos> But they're called "Fairly Manilow""<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> Great!<eos> No!<eos> Well, what do you want to do?<eos> Well, we're in Vegas.<eos> I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.<eos> What if we don't want to vomit?<eos> Oh, you will.
Salam Halabi.<eos> Radial fracture, multiple broken ribs, suspected hemothorax from intercostal hemorrhaging.<eos> We need to throw in a chest tube.<eos> I'm sorry, but you can't take this man.<eos> He is wanted by the authorities.<eos> We have to alert the police...<eos> - Molly: He'll die if you wait.<eos> - EMT: Before we admit him to the hospital.<eos> Then he'll die.<eos> No, he won't.
In your house?<eos> Is it safe?<eos> I have a spot.<eos> A spot?<eos> That nobody else knows about.<eos> Well, maybe you should tell us where this is.<eos> You know, just in case anything were to happen to you.<eos> Good-bye, hanna.<eos> Be careful please.<eos> I will.
Let me get you some cash.<eos> I opened the wine.<eos> I should probably pay for the keg.<eos> He looks so young.<eos> He is.<eos> He's only fifteen.<eos> What are we going to do with him?<eos> We're going to help him.<eos> What if he doesn't want our help?<eos> He will.
You're the only person in the world that he listens to.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I'm his father, in a way, the one that cares about him.<eos> I'll set him straight.<eos> Ezra, thank you for being a reasonable man.<eos> You understand that Ray can't know that I'm connected to anything that might happen.<eos> He won't.<eos> And I look forward to having a very powerful friend in Washington.<eos> Of course, Ezra.<eos> You will.
You can remove dead leaves if you see any. Okay?<eos> It's easy, there's almost nothing to do.<eos> -Yes, I understand.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -Make yourself at home.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> -Don't forget my plants.<eos> -No.<eos> -Promise?<eos> -l won't.
Well, I'll let you get some rest.<eos> _ _ _<eos> Madam Secretary, I'm sorry<eos> - to interrupt.<eos> - Did you hear back from the China desk?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> We're holding a Chinese spy that Beijing very much wants back.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Run it by the White House,<eos> - will you?
Is that all you're worried about?<eos> My acolytes are everywhere in Vega.<eos> The ivory towers, the nuclear plants, your military.<eos> I mean, how do you think I walked out of my cell?<eos> Come on, Alex!<eos> Put your faith in me.<eos> Give me a chance to guide you.<eos> The only way we can end this war and bring father back is through your markings.<eos> It's never gonna happen.<eos> Yes, it will.
Correct.<eos> And then I get hammered.<eos> What if this doesn't work?<eos> You got roughly 45 minutes.<eos> Take your car, get Ralph, drive like hell past the Santa Monica mountains.<eos> Radiation cloud should pool up in the San Fernando Valley basin.<eos> You might be okay.<eos> No one would blame you if you wanted a head start.<eos> If it doesn't work, I'll go get Ralph.<eos> But it will.

If you breach the wall here, even just a crack, you could get them more air.<eos> It's worth a try.<eos> She's not even an engineer.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Now go do it!<eos> As you wish.<eos> Do you have any weapons?<eos> Why?<eos> You'll need them.<eos> We both will.
This again?<eos> Okay, should I just come back later?<eos> Dassin, what are you doing?<eos> You're my boss!<eos> He's counting on me not shooting you.<eos> You wouldn't do that, would you?<eos> Frank wouldn't do that.<eos> Stay there!<eos> Be seeing you, Frank.<eos> Yes, you will.
For all I know, that's why it didn't work out for him up there and it's... The least I can do, is comfort him when he's down.<eos> Go.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> What are you doin' here?<eos> Stuff has been sitting on your desk for days.<eos> I wanted you to have it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll need it for my new office.<eos> You got a job?<eos> - Not yet, but I will. - Oh.
Are they getting younger or are we getting older?<eos> Where are you lot from?<eos> I'm Harry.<eos> From Southport, Lancashire.<eos> All of us are from Lancashire.<eos> - How long have you been out here?<eos> - We landed last week.<eos> - You seen any Germans yet?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - You will.
The English and the French are about to throw everything they've got at us.<eos> Then this is it?<eos> That whatever happens here, it'll be the end of it?<eos> ~ Seen any Germans yet?<eos> ~ Not yet.<eos> ~ You will.
I mean, what if this is all there is?<eos> All there's ever going to be?<eos> They tell us we're moving forward, or north or east or back where we started, but half the time we have no idea where we are.<eos> We fire at these figures in the distance, but we don't really know who we're shooting at.<eos> This isn't a war like I read about in school, like I thought it was going be.<eos> I'm not conquering anything, marching into towns with flags.<eos> So what if... ~ What if it never ends?<eos> ~ Wars end. Yeah, but there's never been a war like this, has there?<eos> If there's never been a war like this, how do we know it will end?<eos> It will.
I've always loved these windows.<eos> Let's make a wish.<eos> Yeah, let's make a wish for Spencer.<eos> Guys, Santa is not bringing me a stay-out-of-jail-free card.<eos> Han, want a snowflake?<eos> The last time I was here, it was with Mona.<eos> What'd you wish for?<eos> You're my first friend, Hanna.<eos> I wished for us to always stay close.<eos> We will.
Get me some.<eos> Hardly any crib girls to run now, ma.<eos> And miss Logan runs herself.<eos> Dance, Mrs. Briggs?<eos> And whiskey to follow it?<eos> Mr. Caze.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> You are my true love.<eos> - If your man comes in...<eos> - He won't.
- All right.<eos> - Hand over your ring.<eos> - What?<eos> Your ring.<eos> Ok.<eos> Elena Williams...<eos> Ohh! Stefan Cooper, what are you doing?<eos> We've known each other for a very long time now, and you've always been my best friend.<eos> I have always loved you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.<eos> - Will you...
Me and Chris will.<eos> No.<eos> Gonna stay behind, do a bit of work.<eos> Can't.<eos> So, why would I pull you to one side and tell you something I thought you already knew?<eos> I'm not being funny, Rach, but this one's on you.<eos> All right.<eos> I just feel a bit of a dick.<eos> They'll love this down the pub.<eos> No, they won't.
For who?<eos> Businessman, his name's Tommy.<eos> He couldn't get hold of me one time so he bought me this crappy phone.<eos> Doing what?<eos> Just driving, you know, just like on the cabs now.<eos> Except without Amjad taking his cut.<eos> ~ And you never mentioned this.<eos> ~ I didn't want to worry you.<eos> ~ What if he finds out?<eos> ~ He won't.
I'm at the petrol station.<eos> Give us a call when you're ready and I'll come back and get you.<eos> Hello.<eos> Is Sophie there?<eos> Yes, she is, Ned, but she's in the bath.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I'm here and she's in the bath.<eos> I understand.<eos> - Good.<eos> - But will your wife?
- No, I haven't.<eos> - Can I interview you?<eos> - God damn it, Fjord.<eos> - What's your favorite horror film?<eos> Hey, relax!<eos> You're the one who got me that shrimp salad burger.<eos> We were just talking about movies.<eos> About The Blair Witch Project!<eos> They'll figure it out!<eos> No, they won't.
And they hired you for that?<eos> They hired me for my ability to predict things. That many people think aren't subject to prediction.<eos> Are you saying you can predict things about the returned?<eos> When it will happen again, how many will come, How long before they'll disappear.<eos> Everything in nature follows a pattern. And is therefore subject to prediction.<eos> How do you define nature?<eos> Definitions change, but numbers are perfect.<eos> Numbers don't lie.<eos> You really don't know anything, do you?<eos> We will.
I didn't want to burden you with mine.<eos> What are you talking about, Sarge?<eos> Kind of blew up in the hot seat at Compstat.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Put my foot in my mouth big time.<eos> Just got a call from the commissioner.<eos> He wants to see me and my box down at One PP.<eos> Well, how about I'll talk to him.<eos> The hell you will.
- Shit happens.<eos> - I was right.<eos> - About what?<eos> - I'm not cut out for undercover.<eos> Or for this job.<eos> Take a look.<eos> Closer.<eos> I saw them!<eos> Don't you want to catch the motherfuckers?<eos> Those I will.
A couple of years ago?<eos> I won't let anybody hurt David.<eos> And if it's money this Malcolm wants, there is another solution.<eos> I trust that you'll get that in the right hands and keep mine clean.<eos> Shouldn't be a problem.<eos> I'm getting impatient, Nolan.<eos> We have a deadline.<eos> Were you able to get into her records?<eos> I was, but...<eos> You won't.
Maybe a... tall tale from a feeble, senile old man.<eos> I gotta go to the restroom.<eos> Well, that was a pathetic ploy, even for you, Dwayne.<eos> What's pathetic is you filing for an injunction to stop the exhumation of Jacob Tarlow to protect your father.<eos> First:<eos> Keep coming after my father, and I will make things very uncomfortable for you in this city.<eos> And second:<eos> You don't know that that injunction is me.<eos> I don't have to know.<eos> Judge will.
I have a deluded sense of confidence.<eos> My physical therapist says it's the secret to my success.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> Yes. Really?<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Emma, we're not gonna break up when we get out of here.<eos> I mean, it could happen.<eos> No, it won't.
I can't do it anymore.<eos> Guide her in her duties of a wife.<eos> Jacob looked so happy.<eos> - And bless this union.<eos> - Your posture!<eos> This is gonna be a great wedding.<eos> As you ready her for...<eos> Stop!<eos> I can't do this!<eos> I won't!
Let me go.<eos> He killed my boy, and I can't let him get away with it.<eos> What about your daughter?<eos> The police are here to arrest Bud.<eos> This gig is his last.<eos> You still have time to be Ella's father.<eos> I was gone half her life.<eos> She's never gonna speak to me again.<eos> We know why you wrote "6 A.M."<eos> Now she will, too.
It's too late for that, I can't stop her now.<eos> Christ!<eos> Nancy?<eos> Oh, Nancy.<eos> Come on, let me dry your eyes.<eos> You live your life, and then it's gone.<eos> Nowt to be done about it, love.<eos> And after...<eos> Who will remember me?<eos> I will.
You did a lot of good stuff for my kids when I wasn't there for them, and I never thanked you.<eos> So... thank you.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, is this one of those amends things?<eos> I guess it is.<eos> Cool, I've never gotten one of those.<eos> Bring it in.<eos> Bring it in, come on.<eos> I'm just scared that now that you have a beautiful house and a pool and this great new life that Roscoe will never want to come back to my place.<eos> Of course he will.
Counting your money, you old skinflint?<eos> Wait here, I won't be long.<eos> Now then,<eos> I hear about town you plan to propose to Fanny again.<eos> I could tell you that's none of your business.<eos> None of my business?<eos> Precisely.<eos> But I have nothing to hide so I can tell you I've proposed again. And I wasn't turned down.<eos> Sorry, but the marriage won't happen.<eos> - It won't? - No.
Janeen.<eos> She said that I could stay with her for a while.<eos> What should I do?<eos> You want to know if I think you should stay or go?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Henry.<eos> I think it's time that you lived your life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If only I knew what that meant.<eos> You will.
I haven't kissed a man for so long.<eos> Shit, I think I'm more the relationship type.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Yeah, everything's okay.<eos> Nothing against you.<eos> It was... holy moly.<eos> Amazing.<eos> But with Kati, we know each other.<eos> Do not tell Paul about this.<eos> Okay, I won't. Why?
- You will recognize the child and marry my daughter!<eos> - No.<eos> I can't. How should that work?<eos> Okay, what's happening?<eos> What's he doing?<eos> - Now run really fast!<eos> - Run , okay. Stop!<eos> Wait!<eos> - Promise me not to use your right of withdrawal .<eos> - Okay, I won't.
We do fine.<eos> Shoots out your ass in taxes though, right?<eos> Hey, if you're smart, you do what I do.<eos> Incorporate offshore.<eos> The Bahamas don't exactly sweat your paperwork and the IRS can't touch it.<eos> You have any money here in the States?<eos> Of course!<eos> My offshore stuff is just a rainy day fund, margarita money.<eos> You should meet my accountant, he's a friggin' miracle man.<eos> Maybe I will.
Move your feet!<eos> Sell her.<eos> What's all this?<eos> You will sell the Negress.<eos> Sell little Pats?<eos> She pick with more vigor than any other nigger.<eos> Choose another to go.<eos> No other.<eos> Sell her.<eos> I will not.
Always on the edge.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you understand women?<eos> There will be a funeral in a few days' time in London.<eos> Would you consider coming?<eos> A funeral?<eos> Don't know.<eos> I mean, it would be good to have a drink with him, but... A funeral? After so long...<eos> You miss that train next time and I won't be waiting.<eos> Yeah, you will.
One more run down the ski slope.<eos> One more minute in the museum.<eos> One more friend over.<eos> Later that same appetite that made her. So much fun to be around ended up being...<eos> I'm gonna go sit next to my sister.<eos> Ended up being what took her from us.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> But today I remember the girl. Who wanted to take in as much life as she could.<eos> I love you to the moon and back, Vivian.<eos> I always will.

Sometimes you cannot fight it because you are a part of it.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> As though she were created of you and me.<eos> And that is why I simply will not see her diminished.<eos> The niece of the Marquis of Winchester.<eos> Mr. James Ashford is to marry the niece of the Marquis of Winchester.<eos> I'm reading it here.<eos> Well, that will render your future mother-in-law ecstatic, Dido.<eos> Don't you dare say a word.<eos> I won't.
You look pretty rough.<eos> Thanks, you too.<eos> We won't get through this unless we sort it.<eos> -I'll get through this.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - What do I want?<eos> I want you to get down.<eos> Right here. Trousers down.<eos> What?<eos> So you won't then?
- Like what?<eos> - This movie fiasco!<eos> What's wrong with movies?<eos> Look where it led us!<eos> - You'd quit?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - After 10 years?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You can't do that!<eos> - I will.

Okay, I'll see you.<eos> Actually, I was going to have a glass of wine first. You know, to unwind.<eos> And I can see you need a refill, so maybe you want to stop by for a... you know, for a nightcap?<eos> - A nightcap?<eos> - Just came out.<eos> Is Dean Martin going to be there?<eos> - It's... never mind.<eos> It was...<eos> - Sure.<eos> You will?

You know how you're always wanting to do things around here that are more related to actual real estate?<eos> Yes.<eos> I want you to make a list of all the chicks that I, a real estate guy, have taken to pound town.<eos> Why, sir?<eos> Nosy.<eos> Well, if you must know, Jeff and Audrey don't want their baby to share a name with any of the, uh, delightful ladies I've jackhammered. Mm.<eos> - Ladies, indeed. - Yeah.<eos> And I'm thinking it shouldn't just be a list.<eos> We should take this opportunity to create a rich, detailed account of all my conquests.<eos> A sexual tapestry, if you will.
Yes.<eos> I want you to make a list of all the chicks that I, a real estate guy, have taken to pound town.<eos> Why, sir?<eos> Nosy.<eos> Well, if you must know, Jeff and Audrey don't want their baby to share a name with any of the, uh, delightful ladies I've jackhammered. Mm.<eos> - Ladies, indeed. - Yeah.<eos> And I'm thinking it shouldn't just be a list.<eos> We should take this opportunity to create a rich, detailed account of all my conquests.<eos> A sexual tapestry, if you will.<eos> - I will not.
I'm better now.<eos> You?<eos> Well, I pushed Derek's mother down the stairs.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - I did.<eos> They wanted me to radiate evil, so I looked her in the eyes, but I don't know how close the camera was because it was a stuntman in a dress.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I don't think there's a nice way you can do that.<eos> I'm not sure people will want my autograph anymore.<eos> Yes, they will.
- Then they released him?<eos> - No.<eos> Only after Satomi Tachibana denied they were involved.<eos> This is the last.<eos> Now you decide.<eos> APARTMENT TO LET<eos> I'll leave the rental contract here.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We'll need a kitchen cupboard.<eos> No, we won't
Thank you.<eos> And, again, I'm really sorry.<eos> We got a problem.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Selena, you need to get in your uniform right now.<eos> Well, out of all the spas in all the world, you guys got to walk into mine.<eos> And for good reason.<eos> The money from the stolen wire still hasn't turned up.<eos> Maybe it never will.
When we found out you had motive, we took a look at your footage.<eos> Yeah, and you saw that I was filming all night, including while Beau was being killed.<eos> Actually, your camera was filming, but you weren't.<eos> Normally the footage from a hand-held camera would be in motion.<eos> And yours was in motion, except for from 11:50 to 11:58-- About the time Beau headed to the bathroom.<eos> For those eight minutes, the footage was rock-steady.<eos> You put your camera on a tripod and you walked away.<eos> You left it running, knowing that that would give you an alibi.<eos> I mean, yeah, I used a tripod, but that doesn't prove I killed him.<eos> No, but the DNA on the murder weapon will.
Richie, this, right now... This will be the best part.<eos> The dying part?<eos> Not the dying part.<eos> The living.<eos> You... you folks from the mystic east... Have a much better handle on the whole Karma, life/death thing.<eos> Rumi writes, "there's a candle in your heart, ready to be kindled.<eos> There's a void in your soul, ready to be filled.<eos> You feel it, don't you?"<eos> Richie.<eos> You will.
YOU supplied her?<eos> I wasn't good enough.<eos> It's always a difficult situation.<eos> The department decided to take things in a new direction.<eos> Well, I tried my best.<eos> Your contribution won't go unnoticed.<eos> You will be reinstated as deputy.<eos> You're going to make a career change. Do I make myself clear?<eos> What if it gets out?<eos> It won't.
You're her mum.<eos> She loves you and you've given up. How do you reckon she feels?<eos> Steven was one of my first appointments and he's made great progress with the women's vocab and reading.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> The smack fairy.<eos> She deserves a bit of fun, but you're so off your face you don't care.<eos> Toni, you're off your nut, aren't you?<eos> You've got to help me. You supplied her?<eos> What if it gets out?<eos> It won't.
I've been to your village.<eos> I know the decision to join the dark side wasn't yours.<eos> - The Nightsisters made it for you.<eos> - Silence! You think you know me?<eos> It was I who languished for years thinking of nothing but you, nothing but this moment.<eos> And now the perfect tool for my vengeance is in front of us.<eos> I never planned on killing you, but I will make you share my pain, Kenobi.<eos> Satine...<eos> Remember, my dear Obi-Wan, I've loved you always.<eos> I always will.
You can not talk.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> But I gotta tell you something.<eos> If you don't, you're get the death penalty.<eos> You're gonna fry.<eos> And I'm betting that President Grant... he's gonna throw the switch on you himself.<eos> What?<eos> You're gonna fry at the hands of President Grant.<eos> - Now... you talk to me...<eos> - I'll...
This stays small.<eos> You, me, and my team.<eos> You have a judge you can trust?<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> You know, but Pratt's on the crime and terrorism subcommittee.<eos> He'll figure it out.<eos> You won't have much time.<eos> Be careful, Peter.<eos> He can hurt you.<eos> I will.
And you didn't admit to more than that?<eos> No.<eos> I said everything exactly like you told me to.<eos> - You really think I'd spill my guts?<eos> - Calm down.<eos> Why didn't you tell me he was gonna hurt himself?<eos> I never would've done it.<eos> How could I have known?<eos> - I just want all this to go away.<eos> - It will.
You know, my dad did a lot to take advantage of me when I was a kid, so when I feel manipulated like today with Holbrook, I go ballistic, so I'm sorry.<eos> Well, then it's a good thing you got me.<eos> You want to talk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why'd you lie to me?<eos> About speaking to Lorraine. I overheard you on the phone.<eos> I'm paving a path.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Does your wife know she's getting a divorce?<eos> She will very soon.
When I saw that burning wreck of a car, I...<eos> Never felt so powerless.<eos> A few days later, I buried you...<eos> My only child...<eos> Right here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you, Sasha.<eos> No matter what.<eos> I always have.<eos> And I always will.
She had herself declared incompetent to get out of a place to live in order to get a different place to live.<eos> Well, she was supposed to...<eos> No.<eos> I haven't gotten to the crazy yet.<eos> She had herself declared incompetent to get out of a place to live and you helped her!<eos> She certainly can't expect me to live in a place with so many memories.<eos> Who co-signs on a house with a guy they know it's not gonna work out with?<eos> Well, she didn't know that.<eos> It never works out.<eos> It will with Rufus.
Suddenly, you're worried about ethics?<eos> I know.<eos> I threw them out the window when I met you because my life was on the line.<eos> Now the threat is over.<eos> And you're bringing another threat into your life.<eos> It's my work. What can I say?<eos> I treat dangerous people.<eos> It's a hazard of the job.<eos> Besides, you have no proof that Zach Hamilton is guilty of anything.<eos> I will.
Some of which you manufactured yourself.<eos> I was setting a trap.<eos> Interesting to see what a decent defense attorney does with that assertion.<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> I'm ready to stick it in.<eos> I'm not gonna need you to testify, Terry.<eos> No?<eos> They may be smug now, but they'll be banging down my door to make a deal time we're done.<eos> - You got something?<eos> - We will.
Ah, thanks for doing that.<eos> Look, I'll get her some shots and she'll be over it soon enough.<eos> Yeah, no worries.<eos> Give her a good night.<eos> Ah, yeah, thanks. All right.<eos> Mmm. It's nice.<eos> I ain't got no change.<eos> Laura! Laura!<eos> You are never gonna guess what I've just been doing.<eos> - Oh, I will.
That shit never gets old, right?<eos> I might actually be lucky this happened now.<eos> Guards just think I got the flu like everyone else.<eos> Well, in two days, you're gonna be wishing you had the flu.<eos> I'm lucky you're here with me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'll get through it.<eos> I'll get back on track.<eos> They won't even find out I was using.<eos> Yes, they will.
Yeah, I caught a ride with the tac team.<eos> [Engine starts]<eos> Home sweet home.<eos> Yeah, I'm kinda relieved nobody's here.<eos> You know they're gonna want to take care of you, right?<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.<eos> You gonna tell 'em?<eos> I mean, there's not much to tell.<eos> It's not like I'll be shooting up in an alley or anything.<eos> You won't?
You know, most folks, they... they wrote me off.<eos> But some didn't.<eos> And they found me.<eos> "They"?<eos> Believers.<eos> People that know that magic is real.<eos> And that it doesn't belong in this world and are willing to do something about it.<eos> This little quest of yours to cleanse the world of magic...<eos> It's not gonna work.<eos> No, of course it will.
Yeah, I don't think so.<eos> Take a look.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> He's alive, Hook.<eos> He beat you.<eos> Now this guy has some powerful magic, mate.<eos> He's untouchable.<eos> You'll never get another chance to take him down.<eos> Oh, I will.
Oh, no.<eos> We don't call anything a love field.<eos> - No?<eos> - (Both) No.<eos> Well, anyway, that's how we meet, and from that moment forward, we are together and in harmony for all eternity.<eos> Well, not always in har...<eos> - In harmony for all eternity.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Well, I wonder if I'd like it being that easy.<eos> The whole drama of dating, the "will-they-won't-they?"
You call me whatever you want.<eos> - Thanks, Dr. Cole.<eos> - You got it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I was hoping to get your signature on something.<eos> It's a letter of recommendation.<eos> Right, right.<eos> I feel awful even asking.<eos> It's like I'm cheating on you, but the best Doctor Young could do is put me back in the temp pool until I get a new boss.<eos> And you will... someone great, all right?
It's probably just something you ate.<eos> Okay.<eos> And I'm sure as soon as you can keep some food down,<eos> Dr. Kimura is gonna let you go home.<eos> - How is she?<eos> - Um, she's fine.<eos> Why did you even ask me to see her?<eos> It's clear there's nothing wrong neurologically.<eos> With Dr. Cole gone, I-I guess I didn't wanna make any mistakes.<eos> You won't.
So we come from different backgrounds. So what?<eos> All that matters is that we made a connection yesterday.<eos> You can't deny that.<eos> Look, I may not know much, I but know that things like this don't happen every day.<eos> What do you say?<eos> What do you expect me to say?<eos> That we'll keep this going while I'm gone.<eos> - I know it's not fair to ask you to wait for me-- - No, it isn't.<eos> I can't get involved with another soldier.<eos> I won't.
What, big, super nurse with your big strong arms?<eos> Do you work out?<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> When a young person has a stroke, they feel very vulnerable.<eos> A man feels less masculine, a woman feels less feminine.<eos> She's just trying to reassure herself...<eos> And that's what she's got me for.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll be more careful.<eos> No, you won't.
I'm better now.<eos> You?<eos> Well, I pushed Derek's mother down the stairs.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - I did.<eos> They wanted me to radiate evil, so I looked her in the eyes, but I don't know how close the camera was because it was a stuntman in a dress.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I don't think there's a nice way you can do that.<eos> I'm not sure people will want my autograph anymore.<eos> Yes, they will.
- Griffin-Moore.<eos> Private security firm.<eos> Perfect way to satisfy her inner cop.<eos> And one of their clients was a tech startup in the Empire State Building.<eos> That's got to be it.<eos> Well, the question is, how do we search it?<eos> We don't.<eos> We keep our distance and let Neal search on his own.<eos> Does he know where to look?<eos> He will.
Listen to me!<eos> I love you!<eos> And I don't care that Phillip's not my son!<eos> I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means I can be with you!<eos> Can you put that down?<eos> This expresses how loudly I love you!<eos> It's too loud.<eos> This is a ring taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the Gangster Patriarch of the Coors Dynasty, melted in a foundry run by mennonites.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes. Yes, I will!
Hank!<eos> Give me your hand! There you go!<eos> Be right back, okay?<eos> So what's gonna happen with her?<eos> She'll disappear.<eos> I'll make sure she does.<eos> So we'll... we'll never know?<eos> It needs to unfurl on its own, Anonymously, Where the world can't interfere.<eos> And if she's carrying what we think, You will know.<eos> We all will.
-Why would I want to do that?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I work for you as long as you'll have me.<eos> I apologise, Will.<eos> I know you've got my back.<eos> I appreciate your honesty very much.<eos> Shall we get on?<eos> -You only have one computer, is that correct?<eos> -Yes. But I don't see what that's got to do with what happened to that woman.<eos> You will.
What are you doing?<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> - It isn't important.<eos> - Bullshit, it's not.<eos> - Don't want you getting mixed up in this. - For Pete's sake, Clyde, take the gun.<eos> Don't take it.<eos> - We'll be in federal lockup by Friday. - Well, nobody asked you, cracker.<eos> You got one minute.<eos> Clyde Barrow, if anything's meant to be between us I think it better start being now. - it's empty. - Well, I didn't know that.<eos> And neither will they.
Did you give him up to the cops? No.<eos> No.<eos> We got careless.<eos> I should have never said anything to you.<eos> No, you did the right thing.<eos> What happened to my son?<eos> Cameron.<eos> Special Agent Gibbs.<eos> Are you gonna be the one to tell me what the hell's going on here?<eos> 'Cause no one else will.
(quietly): We're just trying to protect Jimmy.<eos> Obviously we care about him a little more than you do.<eos> SABRINA: Really?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Name his top three allergies.<eos> Trick question.<eos> He doesn't have any allergies.<eos> If I eat peanuts, I'll die!<eos> That's right.<eos> He will.
It's Larry, right?<eos> Before you have security set their tasers to stun, let me just say that in this box my colleague is holding is dirt.<eos> All the dirt we spent the past week digging up on every single one of you.<eos> Dirty dirt.<eos> Filthy dirt.<eos> Some of it is illegal, and some of it's just downright disgusting.<eos> I'm talking "no amount of Lysol's gonna clean that corporate jet" disgusting.<eos> You know what he's talking about, right?<eos> - Actually, I don't.<eos> - Oh, soon you will.
Look at all those sharks!<eos> Look out!<eos> More Sharks!<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> You got it dad.<eos> Oh my god, there's just too many of them!<eos> We're gonna need a bigger chopper.<eos> - I hope this bomb idea of yours works.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> It will.
- What the hell's that about? - Um...<eos> That would be me.<eos> I think I might have told Charlotte that they could use the bar for a press conference.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Ah, Jack.<eos> I wanted to thank you for allowing us the use of the tavern.<eos> Yeah, sure, but you'll have to excuse me.<eos> I'm running late.<eos> Actually, we were hoping to discuss involving you with the campaign in a more official capacity.<eos> Our very own, uh, "Joe the plumber," if you will.
Not for me, nor for you either, Duchess.<eos> Not these days.<eos> You look very earnest.<eos> I'm on my way to convince the board of the merits of an out clinic, so people can come early for treatment.<eos> I don't suppose...<eos> Don't suppose what?<eos> I could do with some help. I know you suspect me of trying to get you back into harness.<eos> But, well, it would leave a nurse free for other duties.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> I will.
Bob.<eos> The family have some sort of crisis and they need to leave.<eos> Have you found the spare part in there?<eos> Yes. Daniel's looking at it now.<eos> After you. Off you go.<eos> Go on.<eos> - Daniel.<eos> - Tom!<eos> We know what you are.<eos> And after next week's full moon, so will the world.
Because our professionalism and standards have to be beyond reproach, Virginia.<eos> You know, this is not research into kidney disease, which might survive some incident of inner-departmental scandal.<eos> This study is the scandal.<eos> So even a hint of impropriety could derail all our work now, everything that's to come.<eos> I understand you're upset about Scully.<eos> I'm not talking about Scully!<eos> Now, given that every museum in the world is filled with art created from this basic impulse, the greatest literature... the most beautiful music.<eos> The study of sex is the study of the beginning of all life, and science holds the key.<eos> Yet we sit huddled in the dark like prudish cavemen, filled with shame and... and...guilt... when the truth is, nobody understands sex.<eos> And now nobody will.
Yes, I can hear.<eos> The baby is not coming out of my ears.<eos> Hey, Jeff.<eos> Don't look down there, okay?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Jeff!<eos> Can you please try to be helpful?<eos> All right.<eos> I will, okay?
No, because of you.<eos> Because it is written.<eos> Is it written, though?<eos> Cos I've got some money here that should more than cover the whole rewriting process.<eos> It can not be rewritten.<eos> It is too late.<eos> The seas are rising.<eos> No, you've already done that one.<eos> The people in the lowlands will drown.<eos> No, they won't.
- Don't want you getting mixed up in this.<eos> - For Pete's sake, Clyde, take the gun.<eos> Don't take it.<eos> - We'll be in federal lockup by Friday.<eos> - Well, nobody asked you, cracker.<eos> You got one minute.<eos> Clyde Barrow, if anything's meant to be between us I think it better start being now.<eos> - It's empty.<eos> - Well, I didn't know that.<eos> And neither will they.
There's more roast, dear. Potatoes?<eos> I've got a cobbler for dessert.<eos> I'm going to try and get a few hours' sleep before morning.<eos> Thank you for the food.<eos> It's the least I can do after such a terrible ordeal.<eos> But you will have another.<eos> I know you will.<eos> We'll have another.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Because you will.
Sylwia will find you a job at the restaurant.<eos> Then you can go back to training. We will work it out.<eos> Why are you looking at me?<eos> I have 330 euros per month.<eos> I'll have a half time more...<eos> - Why you looking at me?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I will not do that.<eos> You're going to do it.<eos> You will.
- I have no choice.<eos> - You do have a choice.<eos> Right now, Eric has more of Warlow's blood coursing through his veins than Warlow does.<eos> If you want his blood, take it from Eric and leave us the fuck alone.<eos> How about you tell me how I get outta here?<eos> No.<eos> Tell me how I get out or Sookie dies.<eos> - Sookie, use your light.<eos> - It won't work.<eos> It will!
Let me in there.<eos> You hooked him real good.<eos> Come here, you little bugger.<eos> Throw it back.<eos> It's a catfish, cuz.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> Every life matters.<eos> Throw it back.<eos> What if it don't work out?<eos> Well, hey, it will.
You molded her well.<eos> She came that way.<eos> Gentlemen... from all accounts, you and Eli left off in a good place.<eos> I hope we can start there.<eos> This faction poses a threat to your agents as well.<eos> If we act together, we are stronger.<eos> So the FBI has Officer Mantel's body?<eos> No.<eos> You do.<eos> Or you will momentarily.
That's fancy.<eos> Better unpack my suit.<eos> Anything else on your end?<eos> Just the new Mossad director.<eos> Orli has a long- standing history of not playing by the rules.<eos> I would not trust her unless she earns it.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> Let's be careful out there.<eos> McGee.<eos> We will.
- I don't know.<eos> I guess I thought it'd just stay like this and then eventually you'd move into mom and dad's room.<eos> I just can't believe you're really leaving.<eos> Bro, don't worry.<eos> I'll be home at Christmas to pick up my presents.<eos> And you can come visit me if you want.<eos> Might even need you to do some of my homework.<eos> I'm really gonna miss you, Axl.<eos> I know, Brick.<eos> Everyone will.
This is the imposition of the death penalty by other means.<eos> It's a crime against everything we stand for and our legal system.<eos> Let me help you with this.<eos> I'm prepared to make a deal.<eos> Three counts murder one, life without parole.<eos> In exchange, Manuel tells me everything I want to know about his mother's drug operation.<eos> Or we can give your client a little going-away fiesta.<eos> I'll even bring the piñata.<eos> He'll never talk about his mother.<eos> Oh, yes he will.
Here you are, lad.<eos> Support the bill!<eos> Support the bill!<eos> Free to you, Mr Greg.<eos> These commissioners, hand-picked for their indifference to infant suffering, are nothing but apologists for the mill owners!<eos> Their purpose is to delay the passing of the Ten Hour Bill, a bill that merely seeks to ensure that no child works more than ten hours a day.<eos> Our children know nothing but work and suffering from Monday morning to Saturday night.<eos> The cruelties inflicted upon them, the long hours they work, would disgrace a West Indian plantation!<eos> We shall have the Ten Hour Bill!<eos> Yes, we will...
Through hard work and diligence, I've learnt a trade.<eos> I've risen from apprentice to overlooker.<eos> I know nothing of other mills, but I can say that the children employed by Mr Greg are most content with their situation.<eos> When I see one of those pious, canting, liberals riding in their carriage, I remember the vehicle is built of infants' bones.<eos> It's lined with their skin.<eos> The tassels are made out of their hair.<eos> The harness, their sinews.<eos> The very oil with which the wheels are greased is made of infants' blood!<eos> 'We shall have the Ten Hour Bill!<eos> ' 'Yes, we will, yes, we will! '
Listen.<eos> Either you go get him, or I will.<eos> - Do you get me?<eos> - I'll go.<eos> - I can't do it.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I can't, that's all.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> - Hamza reckons you'll go to pieces.<eos> - I won't.
So, what do we do?<eos> Where's your phone?<eos> We're gonna call Gene.<eos> You're gonna tell him you're sorry.<eos> You're gonna tell him you know what he did.<eos> But you haven't told anyone he has Christian.<eos> What?<eos> You're gonna tell him you two can work this out together.<eos> What if he doesn't believe me?<eos> He will.
Hospital?<eos> We might as well advertise why we're here.<eos> Some idiot gave her a chemical douche.<eos> That girl has nasty internal burns.<eos> I wouldn't be surprised if she was septic.<eos> Otto, please.<eos> Charlie...<eos> Go home.<eos> I don't want Kathleen to come to hospital.<eos> Then she won't.
But the... romance...<eos> The romance? Has died?<eos> It was never there.<eos> Ever.<eos> I have... never even kissed her.<eos> You have a son.<eos> Yes.<eos> We have a son.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> It will.
The romance? Has died?<eos> It was never there.<eos> Ever.<eos> I have... never even kissed her.<eos> You have a son.<eos> Yes.<eos> We have a son.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> It will.<eos> One day it will.
Hello, Reynolds.<eos> You took long enough.<eos> Your dad's done a few things he shouldn't.<eos> I'm going to have to go away for a while now.<eos> You look after your mum.<eos> Do as she says.<eos> You be a good boy.<eos> You're the man of the house now.<eos> Remember, your dad loves you.<eos> He always will.
It's my fault.<eos> You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I-I drove her away.<eos> Oh, Raj.<eos> Penny, I...<eos> I miss her already.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I miss Leonard, too.<eos> What's... what is wrong with me?<eos> Why-why can't I ever have love?<eos> You will.
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...<eos> Oh my God, you're back!<eos> So you'd actually rather have "carnival" on your resume than an internship in a state senator's office?<eos> Regina: It's the type of job most high school kids get.<eos> Plus she got this one herself.<eos> What if Bay decides she wants to move in<eos> - with Regina for good?<eos> - She won't.
seriously rough waters until, uh...<eos> Until he...<eos> Then let's get married before the end of the summer.<eos> - For my dad's sake.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That means a lot.<eos> You got a date in mind?<eos> How about August 8th?<eos> I know it sounds silly, but ever since I was a kid, I... always imagined something wonderful would happen on that day.<eos> Hmm. And now something will.
We have equal amounts of wisdom.<eos> And all I want is Henry back.<eos> I should never have broken the curse.<eos> I should've just taken Henry and...<eos> You're right.<eos> Th... then you'd be together.<eos> We missed you growing up, Emma, and it haunts us every day.<eos> And that's why we're here now.<eos> We don't want you to have to go through the same thing, too.<eos> And you won't.
From now on, you work for us.<eos> For me.<eos> I'm your new case officer.<eos> It won't work.<eos> Why's that?<eos> You burned me back home.<eos> - How?<eos> - I'm here with you.<eos> - They don't know that.<eos> - Oh, they will.
- You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I should've shared that intel about Brody with you sooner.<eos> I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.<eos> You've been to hell and back.<eos> I know how important this is to you.<eos> I owe you.<eos> We all do.<eos> Yeah, well, as long as we get the real bomber...<eos> We will.
Thanks, and Spidey, this is just like I was saying before.<eos> Tech can be pretty seductive, but we can't lose sight that it's just a tool.<eos> It's how we use it that matters.<eos> I hear you.<eos> Thanks, Tony.<eos> I'm cool.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Cool!<eos> With Tony busy unzapping employees, he probably wouldn't mind if I borrowed his lab for a few minutes and gave my spider tracers an tune-up.<eos> Of course he won't!
There's a bunch of fruit leather in there.<eos> Have everybody brush their teeth after.<eos> - Can we come out soon?<eos> - Not just yet.<eos> Dad, I was around you when you were in the middle of it.<eos> And I was around Patrick.<eos> I didn't get it.<eos> I can help you.<eos> Thanks, but I need you to stay here.<eos> I will.
Hey.<eos> I've been trying to reach you. Where are you?<eos> Uh, look, it's actually not a great time to talk.<eos> I'm standing in a graveyard.<eos> You're what?<eos> I'm in Ravenswood.<eos> But I'll call you later, okay?<eos> Aria?<eos> You need to be careful.<eos> Yeah, I will.
- I could not find it, sir.<eos> Why I dared to come here, and you will be notified.<eos> Senorita Ribeyes, can I help you? Espinoza looking for, you know, where is it?<eos> Is not likely to go far.<eos> Senor, big smoke in the kitchen.<eos> No need to call anyone.<eos> Maite what are you doing here?<eos> Cisneros, where have you been?<eos> To be opened in the disk before it explodes.<eos> Of course, sir, I will.
It was torture porn.<eos> Who were they?<eos> Persians.<eos> Ghanezi brothers.<eos> You still owe us Trager.<eos> My club has been cut in half.<eos> I lose another body, my charter folds.<eos> Ain't my problem.<eos> Haven't heard anything about Clay.<eos> And you won't.
Yeah, and look how you turned out.<eos> Graduating summa cum laude from both Cambridge and Harvard is quite the failure.<eos> Your parents' choice to "homeschool," much better.<eos> Okay, that was only till I was ten, and my mother's science fair was legendary.<eos> You must be so proud of your uncontested blue ribbons.<eos> Okay, you know what,<eos> I'm not gonna let you shatter the glass that I spent years blowing.<eos> And I'm certainly not gonna let the likes of you tell me who I can and cannot blow.<eos> He's not gonna come.<eos> He will.
Sweet, little boy.<eos> Is he yours?<eos> He's my nephew.<eos> Uh, yes, this is my phone.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A little late.<eos> I believe I'm right on time, Michael.<eos> I thought we were gonna have a face-to-face.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We will.
I didn't hear a gunshot, I didn't hear... I mean, what's attacking him?<eos> Whatever it was, it was close.<eos> You sure I got enough wire?<eos> You said you needed it for the whole roof.<eos> No.<eos> We don't need that much.<eos> I was wrong about that.<eos> It's actually good-- we don't need hardly as much.<eos> Well, be careful.<eos> I will.
And to Sister Bernadette!<eos> He really does look happy.<eos> Men generally do when they've got everything they want.<eos> That's right, get it all out your system!<eos> Now. Who wants to go first, Dasher or Dancer or Donner or Blitzen?<eos> I want to go first!<eos> Me!<eos> Yes.<eos> Father Christmas will come and see Freddie.<eos> Yes, he will.
Just take...<eos> No, no, please.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> It's like I'm not really here.<eos> I can't even feel things with my hands properly.<eos> None of it makes sense, Andrew.<eos> Never will, will it?
I will deliberate on a just punishment... as revealed by heavenly father.<eos> They hurt you bad?<eos> No.<eos> You?<eos> I told them I wasn't forced.<eos> I wanted you to know.<eos> Appreciate that.<eos> Guess it don't make much difference now.<eos> It does to me.<eos> It will to this unborn.
A heartbroken, little crybaby points his finger at me, and my own brother falls in line, eager to believe it.<eos> How quickly you assume the worst, especially when it comes from her.<eos> Oh, spare me you indignation.<eos> When have you ever demonstrated any kind of concern towards Hayley or her child beyond your own selfish pursuits, and what was it you once said to me?<eos> "Every King needs an heir."<eos> My big brother, so you doubt my intentions.<eos> Well, I can't say I'm surprised.<eos> Standing beside the noble Elijah, how can I be anything but the lesser brother... a liar, a manipulator, a bastard?<eos> That's all I am to you, isn't it, and to Rebekah, and judging by the way Hayley hangs on your every word, it's clear she feels the same way.<eos> No doubt, my child will, as well.
Good.<eos> Really good.<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna ask things of you that may not make sense right now-<eos> - See you tomorrow, Luke.<eos> - Not if I see you first.<eos> There it is.<eos> There's that smile.<eos> but they will.
That's the best theory the F.B.I. can come up with?<eos> That Jane killed Benjamin Marx and burned his face off?<eos> We're exploring every angle.<eos> He's an angle.<eos> Listen.<eos> If I wanted to kill Benjamin Marx, I would have done it the first time.<eos> He was a sociopath that stole from widows and orphans, and he got what he deserved.<eos> But I didn't do it.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yes, we will.
That is what you want, isn't it?<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen closely.<eos> Pan trusts me.<eos> He'll let me in.<eos> And maybe, just maybe,<eos> I'll leave a way open for you.<eos> But you've only got one shot, so you better have a good plan.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.
- I need a girlfriend so bad.<eos> - The aching, vulnerable ambition of Dwight.<eos> I want the branch.<eos> And I await your decision.<eos> These are the little glimmers of emotion that keep you vested and interested.<eos> There will always be a part of me that is defined by this character, defined by this show,<eos> - and nothing can make me more proud.<eos> - Oh, look, they're starting.<eos> I'll never have a relationship with another actor the way I do with John Krasinski.<eos> - I just won't.
We've made a breakthrough, sir.<eos> - In...<eos> - The Red John case.<eos> We're close to identifying him.<eos> Well, then this is fantastic news.<eos> After all these years. Y-you--<eos> You really think you've got him?<eos> I do.<eos> I'll know the second you have something concrete.<eos> You will, sir.
So it doesn't bother you breaking up a family and...<eos> Wait, wait, wait, do you think I'm dating Benny?<eos> - To be generous, yeah.<eos> - I'm his daughter, Katie.<eos> You three make quite a crew.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Which reminds me... a cabin on Lake Carroll, two days pulling large-mouth out of crystal clear water.<eos> Oh, man, they're going to love that.<eos> So will you.<eos> Yes, I will.
You know, check that out for a little while.<eos> Nice.<eos> - It just feels different.<eos> - Try again.<eos> Just give me... ♪ No, no, no<eos> ♪ No, no, no it's still catching.<eos> It still feels tight. - It can happen with scar tissue.<eos> - I feel like...<eos> - I feel like I'm never gonna heal.<eos> - Hopefully, you will.
Impressive.<eos> I suppose if there was Ever an uprising that sent my line into hiding, I could always get by as a blacksmith.<eos> But I'd save you.<eos> And we could go to scotland and rule there.<eos> That's a... That's a very kind offer.<eos> I hope I never have to take you up on it.<eos> Natalia.<eos> Did anyone see you come in here? No.<eos> They never do.<eos> They never will.
I'm not going with you, Chin.<eos> Adam's alive.<eos> I'm gonna go find him.<eos> Michael Noshimuri's allies think Adam is dead.<eos> You don't have to run anymore.<eos> But if you go trying to look for him, you both become targets again.<eos> You once told me to follow my heart.<eos> That's what I'm gonna go do.<eos> Just be careful, all right?<eos> I will.
But you can eat the mini boxes of raisins I didn't want.<eos> You'll need your strength to make it through the ni...<eos> Oh, my God, I killed them!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> People are gonna be so mad at me.<eos> I'm gonna have to find a therapist.<eos> Oh, geez, I hope I like my therapist.<eos> You definitely won't.
Yeah.<eos> Did you have any luck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here's the, uh, DV-100.<eos> Just needs the offending party and signatures.<eos> I'll run it back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Want to tell me who it is that needs restraining?<eos> I need to know what you're doing, Tara.<eos> You will.
Scold me.<eos> You said you were going to do it in the morning. Didn't you?<eos> No. I said we'd talk, not that I'd scold you.<eos> Look, son... I know that at home... we haven't talked much about the subject, because... I'm not very good on these things.<eos> But... you're already old enough, and...<eos> -Father, I only have helped her hide.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Okay, yeah, she's pretty, but... nothing happened.<eos> But someday it will happen.<eos> It will.
Have you ever heard of Steve Rogers?<eos> No.<eos> But Captain America ...<eos> now, he's on the news, on a lunchbox, on a poster on the wall.<eos> I don't want to be a superhero.<eos> You want to be recognized... for your gift.<eos> And who is more recognizable than them?<eos> I was given this power for a reason.<eos> - I just want people to see what I can do.<eos> - They will.
Really?<eos> Wow.<eos> Who invented that?<eos> Your grandfather.<eos> I mean, you used to drill that into us every time we went into the city.<eos> Or every time we got on the subway.<eos> Actually, Pop invented it.<eos> He used to do the same thing to me.<eos> But we actually never had to use it.<eos> And please God, we never will again.
Jack, you're supposed to know this by now.<eos> It's too hard.<eos> Why do I have to learn some stupid poem on a stupid statue anyway?<eos> Watch your language!<eos> You should get a time out.<eos> Sean.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What's the point?<eos> I'll never need to know this in real life.<eos> Yes, you will.
We're getting married.<eos> I know you, and I get it, and this is a sweet side of you that I don't get to see very often.<eos> You're scared. Of what?<eos> Look, when I first moved here,<eos> I-I honestly felt like I was Crocodile Dundee.<eos> Right, the city's huge, the buildings are huge.<eos> And everywhere you look, it's, like, there's all these beautiful people who seem to have just come from some secret meeting where they teach you how to make it in the big city.<eos> What if I don't get in?<eos> You didn't.<eos> You will.
Don't do that.<eos> I'm lost. Where are we?<eos> My ears aren't workin'.<eos> Help me out here.<eos> - You suck!<eos> - You suck!<eos> Could you... do you have a mic I could take?<eos> No, you need to turn around.<eos> If you don't get back on the stage now,<eos> - you never will again.
I'm not gonna apologize for wanting him dead.<eos> But you gotta believe me.<eos> I... I never meant for an innocent man to die.<eos> Conrad put Father Paul in that car, not you.<eos> You tried to spare me from a monster.<eos> It was an act of pure selflessness, and one I will always cherish.<eos> So what now?<eos> Does Conrad know?<eos> No.<eos> He never will.
I am.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> You're thinking I'm making a huge mistake.<eos> What if you are?<eos> This isn't something you can just go back and undo.<eos> Why don't you wait a year, okay?<eos> Move into the dorms.<eos> I'm sure Pi can take care of himself.<eos> And if after a year you still want to move in together, I won't say a word.<eos> Yes, you will.
Remember this?<eos> You had it here inside.<eos> Was there something inside the lute?<eos> -I knew nothing, I swear to God.<eos> -What have you done with it?<eos> Have you sold it?<eos> -No... -Have you hidden it?<eos> Where is it? Where!<eos> -I don't know...<eos> You will.
I'll tell him I'm sick or that the travelling will make me ill.<eos> It is for us that I am doing this, Denise, so we can be together in The Paradise.<eos> I know.<eos> I always wanted it to be me out front but it feels better for it to be my baking what's in the limelight.<eos> Thank you, Denise.<eos> Mr Dudley, sir, with your permission, sir,<eos> I would like to be taken off the watch counter.<eos> But the watches are our best-selling item.<eos> You're working wonders.<eos> But still, if you will, sir.
Because you found Ballentine, he's your conquest.<eos> There's no-one here.<eos> What you just told me, Mr Dudley, that's not the true reason, is it?<eos> I would present Mr Ballentine with figures, and he would see in me a man who could be trusted with his investment. You?<eos> You would light up the room, Denise.<eos> I'm good at what I do.<eos> The best at my own job.<eos> But something like this takes an entrepreneur.<eos> I just want to see the look on John's face when I tell him we have a way out.<eos> And you will, Denise.

Previously on "Betrayal"...<eos> - I thought this wasn't gonna happen.<eos> - It won't.
June 9th in Arthur's hotel suite.<eos> That's when he told me he had a son named Teo.<eos> According to a mission report dated June the 12th, a CIA black Ops team raided the A.L.C. stronghold where Mr. Braga was located.<eos> At that time, did you give operative Walker approval to use extraordinary measures against him?<eos> Did you sanction Annie Walker and a CIA black Ops team to torture Teo Braga with full knowledge that he was your husband's son?<eos> Yes or no, Mrs. Campbell?<eos> Yes.<eos> And did your husband know that you gave these orders?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> But he will now.
I never stopped wearing it.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> You don't know what it means to hear you say that.<eos> Federal Agent Rossabi.<eos> I know that you've been colluding with Annie Walker.<eos> When I'm done you're gonna be back in a prison cell.<eos> Did you sanction a CIA black Ops team to torture Teo Braga with full knowledge that he was your husband's son?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Did your husband know that?<eos> - He will now.
That sounds pretty fair to me.<eos> These guys seem pretty sorry about all this.<eos> Maybe we should just let them go.<eos> I got a better idea. Ah-ha!<eos> Teleported them to space jail, huh?<eos> No, I killed them.<eos> Now let's start carrying the sun towards earth.<eos> Go go!<eos> - We're not gonna make it in time.<eos> - Yes we will.
Come in.<eos> Good afternoon, Nurse Hamilton.<eos> Hi.<eos> I don't see anything wrong with your foot.<eos> Weird.<eos> The pain just disappeared.<eos> - I guess I'm all good now.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, come back if it returns.<eos> I will.
I'm a swan.<eos> And a surgeon... a freaking kick ass surgeon... who, by the way, has had sex before.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Does daddy know?<eos> You know what?<eos> You're fired as my bridesmaids, all three of you.<eos> I don't want a single one of you standing up for me at my wedding.<eos> Honey, don't be silly.<eos> You have to have bridesmaids.<eos> And I will.
- Turn over the paper.<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> - Just... turn it over.<eos> - It's not about the money.<eos> - It's a lot of money.<eos> - I don't care how much money it is.<eos> - It's not about that.<eos> - Will you at least watch our movie?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he will.
And he's ready for us.<eos> We're going in full smash.<eos> I want the big head to feel us coming.<eos> Okay, simmer down, you big dummy.<eos> I got another idea.<eos> Going to camo-mode.<eos> Automated male voice: Cloaking device activated.<eos> Hulk: Ugh, you and your big ideas.<eos> (hulk sighs) this ain't gonna work.<eos> Sure, it will.
I very much do,<eos> Your Honor.<eos> It is, uh, an argument about... many things.<eos> Oh. Specifically, if-if this will is invalid, then the identically witnessed<eos> Lockhart-Gardner retainer agreement is invalid, too.<eos> I think that's probably true, but you're still left with an invalid will.<eos> Anything further, Counselor?<eos> Actually, Your Honor, uh, just one brief thought.<eos> If you'll indulge me.<eos> I will.
Herr Keller will brief you on the details.<eos> But please, be discreet about us collaborating.<eos> I hope you can understand.<eos> I do.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Oh, of course! Good luck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am very pleased you decided to help us.<eos> Don't hesitate to call when you find something.<eos> I won't.
I'm going to Washicheng so that she'll have a good life and future<eos> Master Liu, I know, but...<eos> Do you really want to marry Xu?<eos> Do you promise to treat her well forever?<eos> If you do don't go to Washicheng tomorrow<eos> Stay and take care of my daughter<eos> Master Liu, I will marry Xu and take care of her for the rest of her life But I must also go to Washicheng, I don't want any regrets<eos> You don't have any combat experience<eos> Once we arrive at Washicheng stay close behind me<eos> I will, Master Liu
You told me.<eos> You have...<eos> - pencils and notebooks and all that?<eos> - Yes, Dad.<eos> I have class, and, um... then I have patients... so I guess I'll... see you at the house later tonight.<eos> OK.<eos> - Hey, El?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Have a good first day.<eos> I Will.
Please. Why?<eos> - I'm paying you back that money.<eos> - No. It's a gift.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Please let me do this. Why?<eos> - Because I need to.<eos> - We're gonna pay you back.<eos> No, you won't.
Charlie, I can do this.<eos> You're about to be questioned by a federal agency about piloting an airliner drunk.<eos> An airliner that crashed! And you continue to drink!<eos> And stumble around! What kind of crazy do you have to be to do that?<eos> I'm afraid of you.<eos> Okay, all right. Then let me stay with you.<eos> Let me stay with you. They're staking out all my houses anyway.<eos> I'll stay with you until, until... Until the hearing.<eos> I won't leave the house.<eos> I won't.
Here's Lisbon...<eos> This here is Torres Vedras.<eos> This is the first line of Torres.<eos> The vital one.<eos> 20 leagues of fortifications.<eos> 150 redoubts.<eos> 600 pieces of artillery.<eos> There's not even the eye of a needle for the French to get through.<eos> What if they do?<eos> They won't.
Yes. Thanks a lot.<eos> Dr. Tapia's here.<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> Yes?<eos> Why didn't you pick up?<eos> I'm sorry, I thought the police might have your mobile.<eos> Nobody took my mobile.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Has she turned up?<eos> No, but she will.
Cut our interest rate by seven percent.<eos> I'll deal with the Russians.<eos> We need to send a message.<eos> I said I'll deal with it!<eos> Right now, I got one concern:<eos> Ending Johnny Ducks.<eos> Frank...<eos> I get it.<eos> Johnny's your brother, you don't want to give up where he's hiding.<eos> But you will.
This one time. Like I said,<eos> Johnny Ducks was sick.<eos> He didn't know what he was doing, and neither did you.<eos> Now's not the time to harbor grudges.<eos> But if you stay, you do things my way.<eos> Or you go to war with the Russians... and me.<eos> Coffee.<eos> It didn't work. I'm an alternate.<eos> Didn't get on the jury.<eos> You will tomorrow.
But you're taking the case?<eos> Actually, it's not my case, it's Ray's.<eos> Apparently he's been doing some PI work on his own.<eos> Actually, I was thinking I'd do a little work on the side myself.<eos> Really?<eos> Andrew said Martin Moxon was married, that he and his wife were having troubles.<eos> I thought that maybe I would call her, and try to connect.<eos> If her husband was upset enough to kill himself, she must have some idea why.<eos> Okay, just be careful.<eos> I will.
I am the Lord's maid as well.<eos> I've taken so many births, to meet him.<eos> Love and lovers are not bound to the body, or lifetime.<eos> If your love is true then Rajdutt will surely be yours in some lifetime.<eos> I can be born a 100 times for my Rajdutt.<eos> But what will I do in the lifetime he isn't there?<eos> If that's so, then he will come to you in every lifetime.<eos> I pray too Lord for boon that from today Rajdutt and you will be inseparable.<eos> Without him, you won't exist.<eos> And without you, he won't.
Tina...<eos> Tina also had access backstage.<eos> And she was still there after we left for the hospital.<eos> I am having a very strong psychic vision that she is hiding something from the police.<eos> You're sure about this?<eos> Yes. 100% sure.<eos> All right, well, based on your hunch, we have to question Tina again.<eos> Okay.<eos> Please be careful.<eos> I will.
Morning, sir.<eos> Mr Andrews.<eos> Are you the, er, the leader of these men, Mr McCann?<eos> Yes, I speak for them.<eos> And what is your grievance?<eos> Sir, all across this city, workers are being denied their rights.<eos> Even now, honest working men and women are being locked out on a whim.<eos> Denied the basic sustenance of life, because they demand the right to representation.<eos> And you fear the same may happen here?<eos> Will it?
Can we talk now?<eos> Come on.<eos> Marry me.<eos> Andrea, we talked about this.<eos> We said we'd think about it and I had time to do a lot of thinking.<eos> No, YOU said we'd think about it.<eos> I said we'd get on with our lives.<eos> But you're the woman I want to be my wife.<eos> But I don't want that!<eos> But you will.
I thought you were at your internship?<eos> I was, but then I ran into him.<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I didn't think I had to.<eos> Well, you do.<eos> And that's what you said the last time and the time before that.<eos> You know, Jane, you've been doing this a lot lately.<eos> You come and go and stay out late and I never really know who you're with or where you are.<eos> Uh-huh. I will.
I'm gonna cut it out.<eos> Too bad you killed the only one of us with any kind of medical training.<eos> (Cooper) I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> And just who might you be?<eos> I work for the company that hired Mr. Turner.<eos> He's the first completely successful human implant.<eos> It won't do you any good to cut him up.<eos> Then I'll just cut off the whole hand.<eos> That certainly won't work.<eos> (Mr. Pike) What will?
Come on, baby.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Come on, Charlie.<eos> - You should get some sleep.<eos> - No, I don't wanna sleep.<eos> I don't wanna sleep.<eos> I wanna fuck.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Hey, please.<eos> Please, will you just...?
I tell you Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.<eos> No wonder you hate to hear the crowing of the rooster.<eos> I was a fool.<eos> But you said he forgave you.<eos> Yes, later, not that I deserved it.<eos> So Jesus became the sacrifice.<eos> Yes, he was ushering in the new covenant that his death would symbolize.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Not really.<eos> In time, you will.
When I feel that I need them.<eos> Okay, so you're self-medicating now?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You want to talk about something?<eos> You're so sweet, Lloyd.<eos> You care so much for me.<eos> All right, you see...<eos> Normally, you wouldn't stand this close to me.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then I won't.
Karen didn't want us in there.<eos> They told us to wait out here.<eos> Okay.<eos> She's in room 803.<eos> Right. Oh, hey, um,<eos> I wanted to give you guys something.<eos> Uh, made this for the baby.<eos> Um, if you guys could give it to him at some point, you know, if you feel like it.<eos> Yeah. Thank you, Lip.<eos> Yeah, we will.
15 years ago.<eos> Cancer.<eos> Take care.<eos> Of course I remember the memo.<eos> How could you forget something like that?<eos> - Oh, thank you. - Mm-hmm.<eos> So then, why won't you testify?<eos> It's not that I don't want to.<eos> It's that what I remember won't matter once they're through with me.<eos> But it will.
We do voices analyzes.<eos> Identifies the faces, one of the children must be a Bin Laden.<eos> Good work, Hollins.<eos> We got him.<eos> I interrupting something in?<eos> Who do we have?<eos> See the AK-47 on the wall?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The's are there in each house.<eos> This guard will here exact same weapon.
Without me, you're nothing.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Your 976th and 977th kill.<eos> How did you bake that so fast?<eos> - Is this wednesday? - No.<eos> It's tuesday.<eos> [Bleep]<eos> Oh, Chris, look.<eos> These cakes show everything that's happened to us.<eos> And everything that ever will.
Come on. Really?<eos> Whose box is that?<eos> Ray's.<eos> Did you want to talk about why you're not moving into Charlie's office?<eos> No, but I'll talk about how much fun it's gonna be punching you in the face if you don't get back to work.<eos> Listen, Ray, not only am I interested, but I have a vested interest in how you're dealing with Charlie's death, specifically as it pertains to how effective a leader you'll be.<eos> Not, you not moving into Charlie's empty office may be construed less as a show of respect and more as a sign that you don't feel like you deserve this promotion, and maybe you're struggling...<eos> I wanted you to talk to the cons, not me.<eos> I tried, per your directive;<eos> They won't.
Yes, it does - yes it does!<eos> And deep down I know you want me to help you figure out what kind of shit.<eos> Yeah, because there's nothing I love more than spending time with you.<eos> Please, Richard...<eos> The Shirley Temple on your menu.<eos> Hiring Iris to...<eos> pleasure my plumbing.<eos> You know you care about me.<eos> Shut your yap!<eos> I will not!
Isn't that what life's about?<eos> Holding on to your good memories?<eos> All I wanted was a moment with Astrid.<eos> One moment to give me hope that any dream is possible.<eos> You've had all that, Mary Margaret.<eos> So stop feeling sorry for yourself and enjoy it.<eos> Because I haven't.<eos> Well, if I had the dream, I'm sorry to say it wasn't worth it.<eos> Then sitting here drinking won't end this pain.<eos> What will?
You got my friend killed!<eos> How could you let this happen?<eos> Get in.<eos> Hey, Russell...<eos> Hey, D.B., it's Nick.<eos> Listen, I got a lead on the money trail from Mark Gabriel's company to his hit squad via the Swiss bank account.<eos> So, you need to call me back so I can fill you in, all right?<eos> - Hey, Sara. - You seen Catherine?<eos> No.<eos> You probably won't for a few days.
Not wasting your time here.<eos> You can't afford not to buy this one.<eos> You don't have a lot of time left, literally.<eos> Pass this to your kids and grand kids.<eos> Show them your life had meaning.<eos> Grandpa.<eos> See that Billy, that's an emerald on 14 carat gold.<eos> Think your sister would like that?<eos> She doesn't like jewelry, grandpa.<eos> She will one day.
Turns out a little kid was just being sarcastic.<eos> That kid's probably grounded for a month.<eos> Check that I'm sure he's grounded for two months.<eos> And a week.<eos> Football needs to be made safer so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen.<eos> Yeah, that's a fast ball right there.<eos> That's a real stroke of philosophic genius.<eos> War little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football and I don't know what else to say but so long sarcastaball, it was nice knowing you.<eos> Let's just hope nothing like this ever happens again.<eos> Probably won't.
Or how they aided Batiatus in tethering me to this house.<eos> I but did as my dominus commanded, absent thought of refusal.<eos> As I would faithfully serve you now, in seeing Spartacus brought to his end.<eos> You speak of loyalties.<eos> Yet the mark of Batiatus brings allegiance to question.<eos> A blight upon flesh.<eos> Forever mocking more noble intentions.<eos> Prove them.<eos> And live to see if you are of further use.<eos> Your will.
Why don't me or Ame go to one?<eos> that's because...<eos> I wanna to go to one too! You can't!<eos> {RAME! } I will!<eos> {IKUUUU! } You can't!<eos> {RAME! }<eos> I will!<eos> {IKU IKU ICCHAU!<eos> }<eos> I will! {IKU! }
My heart's still beating like crazy.<eos> why'd you hide?<eos> Hey.<eos> It's like an ocean out there.<eos> Feels like we're going to sink into it.<eos> Are we gonna live here in secret forever?<eos> Not like we have a choice if our parents don't show up.<eos> Why?<eos> Your mom will definitely show up.<eos> She won't.
She needs to be needed.<eos> Exactly. And given what I've been going through,<eos> I kinda get that.<eos> Yeah. So if you could, Susan, cut her a break.<eos> She's lost a lot.<eos> I don't want her losing you, too.<eos> I think that's why she's going so overboard on this nursery thing.<eos> She hopes it'll get Julie excited about the baby, maybe bring her back.<eos> You know, you're taking all my anger away, and that's not gonna leave me anything.<eos> Yeah, it will.
That's pathetic.<eos> You're gonna graduate in a year, and you don't even know who Patton is?<eos> Well, I could amaze you with some of the stuff I don't know.<eos> So this death napkin that says I have to live with Lucy--<eos> Nobody's living with Lucy.<eos> Nobody's going anywhere!<eos> Everyone is staying exactly as they are right here, right now, forever.<eos> The point is, she was a nice lady who looked good and died in her sleep and lived a long life and is in a pretty place and met Patton and made a hell of a cheesecake.<eos> And we'll miss her.<eos> We really will.
- Or was that pity?<eos> - Evan...<eos> Look, I don't need your help.<eos> I don't want your help.<eos> What I do want is for you to stop treating me like some screw-up little kid.<eos> But you'll never do that, because you like feeling better than me... you always have.<eos> Or maybe you're just mad and resentful because somehow, some way, you always do mess things up, and I'm left to clean up the mess.<eos> And I am tired of always cleaning up after you.<eos> - Then don't!<eos> - I won't!
Go! Go!<eos> I knew it.<eos> That is it.<eos> I'm going for way more than a slap.<eos> Hanna, stop.<eos> Stop why? !<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I'm ready to hang a sign-- "Bitch can see."<eos> She doesn't know that we know.<eos> She will in a minute.
Look, mom,<eos> I didn't mean to spring this on you on your way out the door, but John and I were talking about the car washes and...<eos> Oh. I already talked to John about the car wash.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah, I gave him the mock-ups for the green advertising campaign.<eos> Would you make sure he looks it over?<eos> - M-mo... - There they are!<eos> Bye, grandma Bonnie.<eos> Have a safe flight.<eos> Thanks, honey. I will.
I think you'll agree that I've given you everything you asked for.<eos> This call is a silver bullet for Ellen Parsons.<eos> She gets her hands on it, your case is sunk.<eos> Then she better not hear it.<eos> Oh, she won't.<eos> I deleted the call from our records.<eos> And I'm leaving the only copy with you.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Reinsdorf.<eos> I trust your friend at the Times won't be running the story.<eos> No, he won't.
Is there anything we can do you for you while you're still here?<eos> Oh, oh. Do you guys have access to a nuclear sub?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Can we buzz the tower in an f-14? Yeah.<eos> Uh, that's just a movie.<eos> Well, good luck over there.<eos> Keep your heads down.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We will.
Thanks for that thought.<eos> Seriously, though.<eos> If we don't find the exit door to this ride...<eos> I just want to say --<eos> Don't.<eos> Okay?<eos> We're gonna make it.<eos> We always do.<eos> But, Hal, what if we don't?<eos> We will.
- What are your moves?<eos> - We don't really have any.<eos> Oh, so you need me to help?<eos> Cool.<eos> Okay, first thing to know about guys like that is keep your sentences short.<eos> Don't mention Tolstoy or math, it will just make you sad.<eos> Oh, and it really helps if you have a car and an income,<eos> - 'cause that guy's got nothin'.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> And he never will.
Well, my husband was supposed to pick me up at 6:00 but he can be such an idiot.<eos> I'm sure he can.<eos> Where did you go to school, Devin?<eos> I had the best education in the world.<eos> Private kindergarten where I got straight check marks.<eos> Experimental boarding school in carmel where the students teach the teachers, and the teachers teach animals.<eos> Year abroad on an all-male catamaran.<eos> Then on to Northwestern where I majored in confidence.<eos> I had every educational advantage, Jack.<eos> Just like my children will.
Yes<eos> You want me to wear it?<eos> Have you ever seen me wearing a burqa?<eos> Just for today<eos> Did you ask me?<eos> - Just for today please<eos> Am I not looking good?<eos> You look beautiful<eos> Did you tell them about Sameer?<eos> I will
He was in a barrel of acid.<eos> Malthus doesn't cut people to pieces, he puts them in acid.<eos> Two friends of mine from Nigeria tell me Malthus has a baboon looking for KG.<eos> Don't we all?<eos> Why should Malthus be looking for KG if he already cut him up?<eos> So the murder has nothing to do with Malthus?<eos> But the killer has Maggie.<eos> Probably.<eos> Please be careful here.<eos> I will.
- I'd love that. - I would be delighted.<eos> Join me in the study, would you?<eos> How about we try one over by the railing?<eos> How dare you drag my father into this.<eos> I was simply telling him about the engagement party.<eos> Oh, the hell you were.<eos> We'll settle all of this tonight at dinner.<eos> He'll be here at 8:00.<eos> - Well, I won't be.<eos> - Of course you will.
Please?<eos> Please.<eos> What'd I say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You didn't say anything, okay?<eos> I just slammed my door a little bit too hard, okay?<eos> - Okay. - Yeah.<eos> - She wants a guy.<eos> - She doesn't want a guy.<eos> She will.
My boss , Murat ...<eos> Seher , my wife .<eos> Did she return?<eos> You never said anything .<eos> She came after having the baby .<eos> God bless you.<eos> You should have told me.<eos> We could have brought your wife here.<eos> - You stay a while, Seher ?<eos> - Yes, I will .
I'm up $200 and three nickels and a juice box I found under the bleachers.<eos> Well, we can't just bet against each other.<eos> No, no, just our luck.<eos> We finally turn into winners and we can't find any losers around.<eos> We know where to find some losers.<eos> Hey, you guys want to gamble?<eos> We were back on the ride.<eos> Great job, Maria!<eos> I could kiss you!<eos> But I won't.
And action!<eos> Behind you.<eos> The law says that I have to accommodate you to the best of my ability, so if you want to stay, go wash dishes.<eos> Can't do much damage there.<eos> Yeah, I'd say sleeping with my brother's girlfriend is not handling things right!<eos> I just have never understood the obsession with marriage as an end game.<eos> - It's a piece of paper. - I order Mr. Sorrento returned to Italy.<eos> I just thought that we had some kind of future together.<eos> - I'm so sorry. - Will you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I... I will.
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Put the pin back in the grenade, angry girl.<eos> I'm just answering your piece.<eos> The law say that I have to accommodate you to the best of my ability, so if you want to stay, go wash dishes.<eos> Will you, Regina Teresa Vasquez, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> - I will.
He stole the two other armored trucks as decoys!<eos> Do we know which truck he's in?<eos> He's not.<eos> Stillman had a getaway car parked and ready.<eos> He just left.<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> I would've, but then he wouldn't be driving around with a GPS tracker in his backseat.<eos> You put your cell phone in his car?<eos> I trust your stay on our little island has allowed for reflection, that past mistakes won't be repeated.<eos> They won't, warden.
That means no wires, no comms.<eos> We'll be blind.<eos> You don't have to do this, Kensi.<eos> Oh, but I do.<eos> If I don't, I may never find the truth.<eos> You'll need this.<eos> A girl has to take steps to protect herself.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Please be careful.<eos> I will.
We need to appeal to the collar countries.<eos> We?<eos> She's been here, what, a month?<eos> There's no room for ego at the table, not when Kitty's helped me get closer to a win than I've ever been.<eos> She knows the players.<eos> So pause after the second line for applause from the live audience, which will tee up the at-home viewers for the follow-up on crime.<eos> Great. Love it.<eos> There'll be plenty of time to sell her fiscal platform afterwards.<eos> What if all this doesn't work?<eos> It will.
What's he doing here?<eos> Here she is!<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Andy's popped in to see us.<eos> - Hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I wondered about getting a takeaway.<eos> Your mum says she's not started cooking, so -<eos> - I'll pay for it.<eos> - No, you won't.
Let's get out of here!<eos> Come on!<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Move!<eos> You don't look like the law.<eos> I've been hearing that.<eos> Ralph: Name's Samantha Meade.<eos> She was found dead next to some motorcycle tracks.<eos> I got a man out there right now checking to see if those tracks match your tires.<eos> Which they will.
I mean, when I tell you NO breaks, because the car's so heavy and the brakes are so tiny.<eos> I've got to say, ovals, I think, are more challenging, and it's because the corner starts way over there, and ends way over there.<eos> And is the car moving?<eos> The car's moving all the time, it's never settled.<eos> And then, you take the cars all around you, the turbulent air.<eos> If they are on the outside of you, it's pulling you around, if they're in front of you, you just don't have the grip.<eos> That's when the entertainment value... goes up tremendously, because you're averaging over 190 miles an hour, with that many cars inches away from one another, and we'll be three or four wide through these corners.<eos> You go to Silverstone, you sit in a... stand on and you go, "meooooo."<eos> You wait one half minutes. See if the order has changed. Yes.<eos> But, most likely, it won't.
Would you like to see it?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> You should.<eos> It's very interesting.<eos> You have a lot to look forward to.<eos> See.<eos> Venus is passing through your 11th House just now turning on your love light.<eos> You need to get your affairs in order.<eos> I'm not having an affairs.<eos> Well, you will soon.
And I needed to admit that to you in person.<eos> Dad, can we please not do this in front of Dexter?<eos> No, if you two are together, then I-I want him to hear this.<eos> I spent a lot of time with a prison shrink, working through my issues.<eos> He said it's important to take responsibility, so that's what I'm here to do.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, I don't expect you to forgive me.<eos> I don't see any reason that you should, not after everything I put you through.<eos> But it's important you know, no matter what, I always loved you.<eos> I always will.
Really?<eos> What's even more amazing is what we found hidden inside it.<eos> I won't go into details except to say that it leaves no doubt as to Doakes's guilt.<eos> Believe me, you won't have to worry about LaGuerta anymore.<eos> Well...<eos> I gotta say that's about the best Christmas present<eos> - I could have imagined.<eos> - You and me both.<eos> Have a good Christmas with your boy.<eos> We will.
Yes.<eos> Black.<eos> Nice and strong.<eos> Route punched into the GPS?<eos> It's all punched in the GPS, although I think I cou get there with my eyes closed. ♪ Needed you so which I will have to do if I don't leave, like, now.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> Have a safe trip.<eos> I will.
Screw the money, screw everything...<eos> It's good that you came back.<eos> Come on children, daughter-in-law made some pie.<eos> But it's not grease again.<eos> It doesn't matter how many times I say...<eos> Come on kid.<eos> Leave that, come inside.<eos> - I'll be right there.<eos> I knew it that you'll come.<eos> - Of course I will.
I'm your chief, not your friend.<eos> You've made that very clear.<eos> Letting go is the easy part.<eos> It's the moving on that's painful.<eos> You have a good life here.<eos> You... have friends, and, you know, sometimes...<eos> Well, I-I can get in the way of... of all that.<eos> Of course, now if you need anything, just pick up the phone, and I'll stop everything, and I'll come right over.<eos> I love you, Adele.<eos> And I always will.
Heaven will direct it.<eos> Nay, let's follow him.<eos> All right.<eos> Mr. Jane, Billy, scene five.<eos> You are on.<eos> Wither wilt thou lead me?<eos> Speak.<eos> I'll go no further.<eos> Mark me.<eos> I will.
You know what?<eos> This isn't going to work out.<eos> I have to go.<eos> No, I have to go.<eos> And I don't like your friends, either.<eos> They're not nice.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> They're still my friends.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Shanna is a powerhouse.<eos> I just feel like I could give Shanna pretty much anything, and she could knock it out of the park.<eos> - ♪ Though I keep searching for an answer ♪<eos> - That sounded cool, but I felt like you were just singing it.<eos> You weren't really, like...<eos> - Okay. Aylin is not the Aylin that just had spunk for days that I saw in callbacks.<eos> - Your family's very devout Muslim, aren't they?<eos> - Yeah. I'm not even allowed to use tampons, because my mom thinks, "oh, it takes away your virginity."<eos> - She doesn't know that I've kissed a guy before.<eos> She will now.
We're on our way now.<eos> That's not much time.<eos> Come on, man, you're CIA; you don't need time.<eos> You keep us alive.<eos> We'll see what we can do.<eos> What happens if we can't get him out?<eos> Let black kill him.<eos> Go to plan "B."<eos> We don't have a plan "B."<eos> We will.
Barney Ross.<eos> Barney... this one's for you, buddy. ♪ Motorin' ♪ ♪ What's your price for flight?<eos> Hey, man, it was nice to meet you.<eos> Same.<eos> See ya.<eos> Hey, can you do me a favor? Yeah.<eos> If...<eos> Oh, I'll go to yours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Will you...
What are you writing again?<eos> I won't say<eos> - Say it!<eos> - I won't.<eos> I'm gonna kill you, say it.<eos> No, I won't say it.<eos> Say it!<eos> Come on.<eos> - No. - I'm going to kill you.<eos> - I won't.
So what do you say?<eos> Are you asking me?<eos> I'm asking.<eos> Th-then-- hen I want to hear it.<eos> I'm serious, Nikki.<eos> If this is it, then I want it all.<eos> Charlotte Mayfield, will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. (Laughs)<eos> Yes, I will.
We'll get by.<eos> Yeah, but we just lost our safety net.<eos> Well, that's what a safety net's for.<eos> You put away money for a rainy day, and--<eos> And now it's pouring?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Well, then it's drizzling really hard, and it's only gonna get worse.<eos> We need to watch every penny.<eos> If anything else happens--<eos> It won't.
You got a thing for mommy.<eos> And now it all makes sense.<eos> Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--<eos> Point, Tanner.<eos> I'll see you in court, Harv.<eos> So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?<eos> He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.<eos> That's funny.<eos> But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.<eos> - It won't.
Who?<eos> Elizabeth Clark.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Oh, why not?<eos> I mean... same line of work in the same area.<eos> I don't like it, Eric; I just don't.<eos> I got it covered.<eos> It'll be all right.<eos> Okay, be careful.<eos> I will.
Mm. Nico, I-it's Tony.<eos> Ran down every lead on the tapes, turned up nothing.<eos> Whoever did this -- a real pro, man.<eos> Well?<eos> That's the guy.<eos> The guy who tried to sell me the tapes.<eos> I need to be certain.<eos> Positive. 100%.<eos> Your pal know you're on to him?<eos> No...but he will.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey!<eos> So, how'd it go?<eos> Well, they seemed happy to see me.<eos> But what about the designs?<eos> - They're looking at them now.<eos> - Okay.<eos> We should know any minute.<eos> God, I hope they like them.<eos> They will.
Do you realize you'll be sleeping alone?<eos> Yes, I think about it every night.<eos> I can't sleep because you snore like a fog horn.<eos> I'm worried, all alone in that house...<eos> I won't be alone, Massimo will be there too.<eos> This Massimo!<eos> I don't see you together.<eos> Actually, I've never seen you together.<eos> - When can I meet him?<eos> - You will.
You're an FBI agent.<eos> I'm a con man.<eos> There are only a few ways this could have ended.<eos> This is one of the best.<eos> Right.<eos> You understand this has to be the last time.<eos> New York and I are done.<eos> I get it.<eos> Please watch out for Collins.<eos> I will.
Elizabeth Burke.<eos> Yes.<eos> Agent Collins.<eos> Uh, my husband's actually at the office.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, then, what are you doing here?<eos> My job.<eos> You can't just walk in like this.<eos> Does agent Hughes know about this?<eos> He will.
Riley was already a Detective.<eos> You mean a professional liar?<eos> She went out with me and Frost to get information on the homicide squad.<eos> I think you should protest.<eos> Ma, come on. What's he gonna do, walk around with a sign?<eos> That could actually increase feelings of disappointment.<eos> Look... all right, you got to strap 'em on, take this like a cop, okay?<eos> Frankie, come on.<eos> You'll get your turn.<eos> No, I won't.
Years later, this report came out that Roosevelt might have known Pearl Harbor was coming and let it happen.<eos> That rattled around in my head for days.<eos> How horrible it would be if it were true.<eos> Then again, it's what got us into the war.<eos> A lot of men died.<eos> But in the end it saved millions.<eos> I bounced back and forth like that until I realized it was too big for me to judge.<eos> He was too big.<eos> I still don't see what that has to do with Batman.<eos> Maybe one day, you will.
- Of course.<eos> I knew what was going to happen to the Congress.<eos> That's impossible...<eos> How could you know?<eos> How I knew, and how I came to be the man I am today, is going to become clear to you...<eos> What is that?<eos> The culmination of my life's work...<eos> You and I have more in common than you realize, Edouard.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will...

What do you think?<eos> Will you have some alcohol, Comrade Major?<eos> We, tankmen, usually do not drink before battle.<eos> We should not.<eos> How many guys burned down just because of alcohol!<eos> But to Berdyev it is nothing.<eos> He is a loader and a drunkard.<eos> Right, Berdyev?<eos> - Do you think he will come?<eos> - He will.
She died.<eos> Six months ago.<eos> And your sister Nyura?<eos> She's dead, too.<eos> Killed last spring in Lisichansky forest.<eos> Let's have a drink.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> What a pity.<eos> I will.
I... I have never seen anything like it.<eos> I... I have loss of words.<eos> It's moments like these I dreamt of in medical school.<eos> I can't find absolutely no sign of infection whatsoever.<eos> It's undoubted that your husband is in an advanced stage of syphilis, and yet...<eos> You're untouched.<eos> Great, it's so nice to be able to give a patience good news for once.<eos> That lying bastard!<eos> I hope the dirty pig dies a slow painful death!<eos> He will.
Before we have a moment's silence for Dolores, her dad would like to say a few words.<eos> Nobody could want a better daughter than Dolores.<eos> She was strong-willed, but I don't have to tell you that.<eos> She was also kind, generous.<eos> She friends tell me she had a wonderful singing voice.<eos> But she had a future.<eos> She has been taken away from us by hatred.<eos> And that does make you want to hate.<eos> I don't know why she died.<eos> I probably never will.
Why do men always think with their tongue?<eos> I came to help you.<eos> Then go back to Jimbo, and show him every boob you've got.<eos> But you told me he was a jerk, and I that I could do better. Oh...<eos> All right.<eos> Follow me to a place where nerds, dorks and dweebs can gather in safety.<eos> This isn't, like, some creepy place under an off-ramp?<eos> Okay, we'll go to my second choice.<eos> Now you be careful with Bart's undies.<eos> We will, Mrs. Simpson.
The flash drive's at my apartment.<eos> I can pick it up. I want you to remove yourself from the case.<eos> You're put the lab in jeopardy, and I want you off the case.<eos> Got nothing of note from Josh Avery's cell phone.<eos> Let's see if Samantha got anything that she might have recorded from his landline.<eos> Just take a minute to download.<eos> I haven't heard anything from the adoption agency.<eos> That's not a good sign.<eos> Listen, it'll all work out.<eos> It will.
He doesn't know anything about computers.<eos> Now, what's a "password"?<eos> I think we could use some extra-sensory help.<eos> Let's consult the pre-cog.<eos> Piper.<eos> Door. - Oh, uh... - Wow.<eos> Just making sure that her tubes were connected right.<eos> I can assure you that they were.<eos> It'll never happen again.<eos> Oh, yes, it will.
Maybe in a couple years.<eos> You're still too small to be of much help.<eos> There has to be something we can do.<eos> Well, unless you think you can find El Dara, all we can do is tighten our belts.<eos> Are you sure we're doing the right thing?<eos> We're no help to the family here, and if we leave, there will be 2 less mouths to feed.<eos> But ma will... Will thank us once we find El Dara.<eos> We'll bring back enough riches for all of us.<eos> But we don't even know where it is.<eos> Someone in thundera will.
Or more specifically, Kyle's hands.<eos> So you had this brilliant plan.<eos> You dosed Kyle with scopolamine, told him to kill David, thinking, nobody will ever figure it out.<eos> Actually, that last part didn't work out so well.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All you have is the word of a few whacked out zombies.<eos> That's not even close to probable cause.<eos> Yeah, well, it's all I need to keep you here for 24 hours.<eos> And by then, I will have my proof.<eos> No, you won't.
So what?<eos> We don't try?<eos> That's just great.<eos> Why don't you walk over there.<eos> I gotta think for a minute.<eos> Whatever you say... Boss.<eos> Why'd you have to make it so quick?<eos> It's better when they suffer.<eos> I don't get off on it like you do.<eos> You will.
Voldemort again.<eos> - I-I just got flustered.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> You don't have to be sorry.<eos> I mean, of course you wouldn't know how to handle this.<eos> I need to talk to him.<eos> I need to have the "talk" with him.<eos> You will have the talk with him.<eos> - Yes, I will.
That one needs a fork, but...<eos> So I wanted to ask you a question.<eos> What?<eos> Okay, well, I talked to Max about his speech.<eos> - And?<eos> - Turns out he has nothing prepared.<eos> Like, Adam, zero.<eos> He didn't write down a stinkin' thing.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will...
Maya? No.<eos> I don't want her involved in this, Moz.<eos> What if she's willing to help?<eos> You talked to her?<eos> She's worried about you.<eos> And I'm sure she'll give Peter a glowing recommendation.<eos> Neal, this plan sounds incredibly intricate.<eos> It is.<eos> What happens if it doesn't work?<eos> It will.
It's room number five, over there.<eos> I really don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> But if that's the last thing I see before they lock me up, I could do worse.<eos> Here.<eos> You think you can save this...<eos> you can't.<eos> I'll get us some food.<eos> They'll be looking for us, and someone might recognize you.<eos> I promised your mother that you would call her.<eos> I will.
A glow-in-the-dark limbic system.<eos> The seat of the emotions.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I hope they appreciate it.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> What newlywed couple wouldn't appreciate the gift of a scan that says 'I love you.'<eos> I'll see you.<eos> You will indeed.<eos> It'll be OK, Larry.<eos> Really it will.
Get yourself off this rock.<eos> This whole place just became the biggest bull's-eye on the planet.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just...<eos> This whole island is a volcano.<eos> The stories we heard as kids, they were about lands plucked from the bottom of the ocean by a giant fish hook or tossed down from the sky by angry gods.<eos> Telling an islander they're going to die violently is just reminding us we're home.<eos> Shower's $10.<eos> Didn't ask.<eos> You will.
- Mister?<eos> - Call me Mose.<eos> Why are they doing this?<eos> They wanna break him out, I suppose.<eos> But killing innocent people?<eos> Why kill Gus?<eos> He had nothing to do with keeping that old guy locked up.<eos> I get the feeling that killing ain't too much of a stretch for this bunch.<eos> What if no help comes?<eos> It will.
Which you did.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Must have known you'd have people watching the place.<eos> My parole officer knows where I'm staying.<eos> I knew I would be arrested within minutes, so why go back?<eos> Because I have just as much incentive to figure out who set that fire as you do.<eos> Someone clearly wants to frame me, someone who has waited a long time for me to get out, but would prefer that I stay caged up in that cell.<eos> And you might know who that someone is?<eos> I'm offering my services.<eos> As a... arson investigator... if you will.
Wow, that's great.<eos> She must've been happy you were there for her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... are we on for a jog Monday morning?<eos> 'Cause I gotta say, I miss my workout partner already.<eos> Actually, Hank, I think I'm gonna have my associate cover for me next week too, and not rush back so fast.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> Well, have fun up there.<eos> And... and tell your family... I'm really sorry I missed out.<eos> I will.
You see, I know it's right, Mary.<eos> I believe I can make Downton safe for our children, if we ever have any.<eos> But I can only do it if you're with me.<eos> But what about Papa?<eos> I do love him.<eos> Love him by all means, but believe in me.<eos> There. Will that convince you?<eos> Convince me again.<eos> And don't say, 'If we ever have any.'<eos> Because we will.
Know what you're going to wear?<eos> Nothing good, that's for sure.<eos> I'll keep an eye on the place.<eos> Oh, don't say you're not coming.<eos> I-I thought you could drive us.<eos> There is no need for impertinence, Edna, thank you.<eos> You're all right.<eos> I'm happy to drive them.<eos> But who'll stay here?<eos> I will.
Well, it appears we'll have a number of questions from the jury this time.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> I said shut the door.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You are really pissing me off.<eos> You're so stupid.<eos> Why do you hurt me?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just that that was a very important number to my daughter, is all.<eos> 318.<eos> San Luis Obispo.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Seriously.<eos> If your stuff fits in the back.<eos> It will.
I don't want to talk about it.<eos> All right.<eos> And back again.<eos> Really?<eos> Come on.<eos> It's supposed to speed up labor.<eos> Well, it's not working.<eos> Give it time, Roxy.<eos> You've never had twins before.<eos> And I never will again.
April!<eos> We don't push, and we don't hit in this family. - We use our words.<eos> - Okay, what's the problem?<eos> He's a moron.<eos> I'm not a moron. You're an idiot.<eos> All right, that's a timeout for both of you.<eos> It's not my fault!<eos> It's his fault.<eos> I'm not gonna have a timeout.<eos> Oh, yes, you will, young lady.
So I'm not gonna give you an excuse to quit.<eos> I don't care what it takes, I'm getting that money.<eos> Planty, no!<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> Okay, who am I?<eos> Who am I?<eos> Doris!<eos> Wonderful.<eos> See you tonight, roomie.<eos> Yes, you will.
It's Snoddy.<eos> Sorry, Snoddy.<eos> You'd think with Snoddy's new club you'd at least try and wipe the slate clean.<eos> Start fresh.<eos> I didn't ask for your opinion.<eos> Well, too bad.<eos> I'm givin' it.<eos> I might keep me mouth shut out there, but here, in the privacy of me own home, I'll have a fuckin' opinion.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You will, won't ya?
Maybe he doesn't trust you.<eos> Why wouldn't he trust me?<eos> You still afraid to get your hands dirty, Saul?<eos> I still prefer to figure the problem out, not obliterate it.<eos> You're too sensitive for this line of work, you always have been.<eos> I'm amazed you've lasted this long.<eos> Me, too.<eos> - Has Brody called?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - He will.
You're very welcome.<eos> Hey-- y-you're very welcome.<eos> - You're very handsome.<eos> - I think we're all done.<eos> - Well, you're very nice.<eos> - Okay. Thank you.<eos> Thank-- thank you very much.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> We'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Well-- Oh, well, you will?
No sign of her this morning.<eos> They're sure something's amiss.<eos> Oh, Granddad!<eos> Oh, I'm sure she's not dead.<eos> Well, the Dixons fear the worst.<eos> She's never been out this long before.<eos> Well, in that case, I'm sure we can rule out foul play.<eos> It's nothing to do with anyone here!<eos> Yeah, Tony, don't worry, we won't stop until we find out exactly what happened to her.<eos> Absolutely we won't.
Your friend at the Pentagon identified him?<eos> No. I spent the day going to homeless shelters.<eos> Turns out a lot of the guys from Desert Storm... ended up going to the one on Carlton Street.<eos> They kept his effects for over 10 years?<eos> The woman who runs the place, she believed that these guys would come back and have a normal life.<eos> Have you contacted his wife?<eos> I'm gonna see her tomorrow morning.<eos> She hasn't seen him in over 15 years.<eos> I need to know what happened to him, Bones.<eos> You will, Booth.
Folks, can you step aside, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me, folks.<eos> Step aside, please.<eos> Get back away, folks.<eos> Well, having Conrad arrested for murder at his own wedding...<eos> Now that's a revenge all-star opportunity.<eos> Still, I don't see how it solves your more pressing problem with Mason Treadwell.<eos> You will.
And, erm, I'm really glad that we can be friends again.<eos> Of course we can.<eos> I thought after the whole threatening to sue me and oinking thing...<eos> That was before.<eos> That was angry Tony.<eos> So who are you now?<eos> Now, I'm nice Tony.<eos> I want to put all that behind us.<eos> Great, well, as long as nasty Tony doesn't come back!<eos> He won't.
Yeah, well, it's both.<eos> We'll study from 9-1, then party like fuck, then study from 3-6 then party like fuck again.<eos> It is good to vary the schedule.<eos> Look - who knows what'll happen?<eos> We might all end up getting so drunk that we have an orgy.<eos> For example.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
Maybe you should just hang up.<eos> You're missing a weekend away.<eos> I willneverhang up.<eos> I know you can hear me. I said, "never"!<eos> We're having a serious study sesh.<eos> Come on, we need caffeine.<eos> Hey, you know what'd be brilliant?<eos> Driving to Wales and gatecrashing Dave's wedding.<eos> Not sure Dave'll love it.<eos> He will!
Don't be crass.<eos> You're skulking.<eos> Women of your generation are graceless.<eos> It's an affront to nature.<eos> Mediocre surgeons will see you and feel themselves wilting in your shadow.<eos> Do not shrink to console them.<eos> Do not look for friends here.<eos> You won't find them.<eos> None of these people have the capacity to understand you.<eos> They never will.
I'm sorry.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> And I just... I don't want to lose "The Spectator."<eos> Or you.<eos> I just saw Lily leaving with Bart.<eos> Did you not tell him you tracked down the Sheikh?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Sheikh's dead, and the daughter won't talk.<eos> She won't?
And I just can't move.<eos> Migraines. You get migraines?<eos> Why didn't you say so?<eos> I tried to. I was going to, but...<eos> But what?<eos> What is it?<eos> So, it's cancer?<eos> But the good news is, we got it all.<eos> There is a chance of reoccurrence if he continues to abuse steroids.<eos> He won't.
- You want to help me, right? If I get a guilty verdict for him, your guy in Chicago goes free.<eos> - Well, that's the hope.<eos> - I don't like defense attorneys, ma'am.<eos> I don't trust them.<eos> Mr. State's Attorney, we have access to the Cook County Medical Examiner's files.<eos> We have an outside forensic analysis...<eos> Good day, ma'am.<eos> Hi.<eos> He doesn't want our help.<eos> He will.
My mother-in-law is a licensed pilot, as she keeps reminding me.<eos> Part of a larger effort to make me feel inferior.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did I just say that out loud?<eos> Sounds like she's staying with you, Captain?<eos> One day soon, your in-laws will visit, too, and when they do, think hotel.<eos> Lord, I hate the holidays.<eos> Yet another quality she has in common with the Grinch.<eos> So if we don't know where our Santa fell from, do we at least know who he is?<eos> Well, hopefully we will soon.
And today I'm on the rope.<eos> Which means I have to rappel down, tramp through the bramble, and haul that frightened little snot-nosed moron up to safety.<eos> Well, he'll be staring into the face of love.<eos> No, offense, but aren't you a little old to be jumping out of helicopters?<eos> Come on.<eos> Look at him.<eos> How many years is he really risking?<eos> Kyle, me and the guys are never gonna retire.<eos> Because every time we bring in some young blood, we find that your generation can't hack it.<eos> And they never will.
Hello?<eos> Hold on one second, okay?<eos> Hi.<eos> Yes, is Reggie there?<eos> No, Reggie's not here.<eos> But if you don't want Thor here to crack your head open.<eos> Then you'll give me that phone!<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Oh, will you looky here.
- One more minute.<eos> - No, no more minutes.<eos> - I'll head off Lily.<eos> Look, she can't keep getting away with this.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> Fair?<eos> My agency meeting was important today.<eos> It was my last shot.<eos> I know, but you'll get another chance.<eos> No, I won't.
What happened to your foot?<eos> Can you play?<eos> Just a minor injury.<eos> I thought everything was fine.<eos> The papers said you didn't adapt well to the team in Argentina.<eos> Lies. You still believe what those people write?<eos> I scored goals when I wanted to.<eos> You've aged.<eos> Here in Brazil they still talk about you a lot.<eos> They always will.
Of course I did.<eos> Harmony over conflict and all that.<eos> Is that wise?<eos> I mean... He almost just killed us.<eos> Actually, I don't think that that was his intention.<eos> You see here the skin is stretched where I was trying to cut it.<eos> Look.<eos> He knows we're trying to help him. The tissue's necrotic.<eos> Father, we've cut through the first layer of dermis, but I don't see any sign of the parasite.<eos> No, and you won't.
This smiling, beautiful gungun.<eos> Like me.<eos> You are saying sweet things to make me feel good.<eos> No, no.<eos> I swear by my third-class poems that you are really beautiful and no one can stop you from becoming a star.<eos> Look, see through my point of view once.<eos> You are a star, okay?<eos> And you are going to go so far... thanks, milind, for being there.<eos> Please don't ever leave me.<eos> - I never will.
♪ We've seen what we never should ♪ How you doing?<eos> Not so good.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> No, I suppose I don't.<eos> But I want you to know something.<eos> I know that I've talked about slowing down and taking our time, but I want you to know that whenever we do get pregnant, that's gonna be a great day.<eos> And I'll be more than okay with it.<eos> ♪ Planes crashing and burn around us ♪ We're not gonna have that day.<eos> Baby, we will.
Oh. That's too bad. I guess I'll have to do the whole supermodel bikini shoot without you.<eos> Puerto Rico sounds awesome.<eos> I mean, pfft.<eos> Supermodels in bikinis?<eos> Have you seen my baby?<eos> Nice try.<eos> Yeah. But I do have camp.<eos> Uh, maybe you can invite the girls?<eos> Haley can't go, but Brooke and Alex.<eos> Maybe I will.
Get a dog.<eos> And may we be truly thankful.<eos> In the name of the father, of the son, the holy spirit.<eos> What?<eos> You're lucky you still believe in something.<eos> Did I hear right?<eos> Mason and his crew are taking Pope on this motorcycle raid?<eos> You got a problem with that?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> But they will.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Hold up. I know you ain't talking.<eos> Yeah, you ought to think about that next time you and Tammy decide to have some more of them little demon seeds y'all got.<eos> - Demon seeds?<eos> - Yeah, you.<eos> My kids ain't bad like that.<eos> Look, man, your kids are out of control.<eos> You got to do better.<eos> Well, she won't let me discipline them.<eos> She won't!
You're gonna be all right, Mr. Brown.<eos> I ain't gonna be all right.<eos> You go in there and they tell you it's gonna be all right,<eos> - you wake up dead. - Oh, no...<eos> Y'all kill people in here.<eos> Have anybody ever died in here?<eos> - Exactly. Cora, don't do this to me, please!<eos> - Calm down, Mr. Brown.<eos> - Cora, tell Madea... Tell Madea I love her.<eos> - I will.
- Kaylie!<eos> - Don't let her rattle you.<eos> What a surprise to see you back.<eos> How was rehab?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> On your "ACL tear." What else did you think I meant?<eos> Kaylie's never been better.<eos> Too bad they don't have rehab for Emily's condition.<eos> You're acting pretty cocky considering you haven't even made the World Team.<eos> - [scoffs] I will.
If you weren't, I wouldn't dream of doing this operation so soon.<eos> Your infection is very aggressive.<eos> Your valve is shot.<eos> And your brain will swell as a result of being on bypass.<eos> Anything else I should know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Monroe's not the only great surgeon in this hospital whatever he thinks.<eos> You think he's a great surgeon?<eos> Does he know you think that?<eos> No. And he never will.
Okay, so this one...<eos> Yes, now if you look at the detail in this rose, and then again at the detail in this scarf, they were both done by the same hand.<eos> Hmm. Intriguing handicraft theory.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But even if we were able to establish a link between the victims, it doesn't exclude the Caveman from being the killer.<eos> It merely expands the modeling paradigm.<eos> Merely expands the modeling paradigm.<eos> Wasn't the Caveman known for sending poetry, animal organs, even crude drawings to the police?<eos> We haven't received anything like that.<eos> We will.
I declared my love for you...<eos> I think "Undying"...<eos> I'd have to check my notes.<eos> Look, I'm in a relationship with somebody.<eos> I get that, Rachel, but on the chance you're with that guy by default,<eos> - I'm not.<eos> - Or that you really want to be with me,<eos> - I don't.<eos> - I thought, should you ever want to get back with me,<eos> - I won't.
Your campaign wants your public image as bright as a new button.<eos> And what does this, uh, sprucing involve?<eos> Well, for starters, I will have my tailor come over and measure you for a new suit.<eos> A new suit?<eos> And who's paying for that?<eos> Don't you worry about that.<eos> That's very generous of you, Isaac.<eos> We are going to knock 'em dead, Inspector!<eos> I will see you soon.<eos> Yes, you will.
Is there anyone out there now?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -You don't know?<eos> Find out!<eos> This is Katrine.<eos> I need a bomb disposal expert, now.<eos> Just take it easy.<eos> We'll be all right, okay?<eos> -When will it explode?<eos> -It won't.
Wait, you've got to see my prom dress.<eos> - Very nice.<eos> - Isn't it?<eos> - What's up, my prince?<eos> - Hey!<eos> Give me a break!<eos> You see?<eos> Low cut on the back, and at the front...<eos> - Your tits will show.<eos> - No they won't!
What do you think?<eos> You told me that if I told you my darkest secret, you wouldn't kill again, tonight.<eos> That's right.<eos> Are you going to keep your word?<eos> Yes.<eos> But, I didn't say anything about tomorrow.<eos> Can you feel the fear, Father?<eos> The knowing that something evil is out there, lurking, waiting.<eos> Not knowing when it's going to strike.<eos> Only that it will.
Okay, okay.<eos> Bam! Okay.<eos> First Class.<eos> Mr. Fargas.<eos> First door on your left.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's your ID.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have a nice flight.<eos> I will.
What are you doing here?<eos> I'm so glad we bumped into each other.<eos> I wanted to thank you for saving my life.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> The girl.<eos> Why did she kill Oscar and the others?<eos> What had they ever done to her?<eos> We don't know.<eos> We never will.
You remember how we used to say that being a vampire was almost perfect?<eos> But the lying, the hiding, the stifling day job to cover our tracks is exhausting and tedious.<eos> When we have the numbers and we have the power, we won't have to hide.<eos> We can live right out in the open.<eos> You're not serious.<eos> Don't tell me you haven't thought about it.<eos> How many times have you drilled it into me?<eos> Keep a low profile, blend in, be invisible.<eos> 'Cause we had to.<eos> Soon we won't.
- Bob.<eos> - Your mother told you to go, so go.<eos> - Out.<eos> - Go on, guys. I'll catch up.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> I don't care what the fucking DNA test says you're not taking Liam.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
I'm doing it for Eliza!<eos> See you packed for Britain, as usual!<eos> Dude!<eos> Hey!<eos> I never thought your mum'd let you come.<eos> I just told her I was going to Israel to have obscene amounts of sex, and she said, "Totally fine."<eos> You will, you know.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> So not true.<eos> You will.
Yeah.<eos> Let's go. Ugh!<eos> Wow, I see you didn't use that waxing coupon I gave you, huh?<eos> FYI, do not go out on a full moon.<eos> You will get locked up.<eos> Quiet down back there, nobody makes fun of my partner but me.<eos> Nice wife-be--<eos> Nice white, ribbed men's tank top.<eos> Hey, how are people gonna know we're cops, anyway?<eos> Hopefully, they won't.
Oh, hey, Nicky, check it out!<eos> - What is... what's this?<eos> - It's tuna tartar.<eos> Come on, you can have your meatballs later. Fish?<eos> - Try some of this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - No, I don't want any fish.<eos> I want a Scotch!<eos> Give me a Scotch, Zoey.<eos> - Will you?
I hate when they grapple like a bunch of bitches in heat!<eos> Yeah. Me too.<eos> You mention an investigator?<eos> Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> This guy. He's a -- He's a real bloodhound.<eos> He's, um - - He's doing some vetting right now, you know, just -- Just checking resources.<eos> But, uh, he's got something good.<eos> It's real good.<eos> You don't have shit.<eos> No, but we will.
Ah, get me a pen, son.<eos> My partner and I will take the suspect into custody.<eos> We anticipate that he'll come quietly, but in case he runs, we need two of you to cover the alley in the back, and you two watch the front.<eos> Okay.<eos> Also, the suspect's wife is pregnant, so radio Seattle general and have an ambulance on call. Thanks.<eos> All right.<eos> Patriot act?<eos> W- we'll have it over to the ADA's office first thing in the morning.<eos> I mean, he won't have any problem getting on board.<eos> Oh, yes, he will.
No, because Mum will think I'm burning all my things.<eos> Wouldn't it be better to actually burn your things?<eos> Don't be an idiot.<eos> I'm not burning all my old magazines!<eos> They're collectibles.<eos> Er, they're really not...<eos> Mum will do a mental on you!<eos> You're not going to tell Mum, are you?<eos> What if she comes in here?<eos> She won't.
Go look for the wires.<eos> Send someone back in a couple hours to relieve me.<eos> We'll take shifts throughout the night.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Come on, take it.<eos> Fuck you, motherfucker!<eos> You thought I was actually gonna feed you?<eos> You know I'm actually gonna kill all three of you, don't you?<eos> I will.
You know, it's no big deal.<eos> You know, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> I'm just tired of being alone.<eos> It's always so difficult with you, you're always so angry.<eos> - I am not angry.<eos> - And I don't work for you any more, Amy.<eos> - So I don't owe you anything.<eos> - Aren't we friends?<eos> - Have a good day.<eos> - I will.
Hey Rose, how are you?<eos> Why can't they all go away?<eos> You're never really alone.<eos> Constantly hounded.<eos> You're getting too caught up in the distractions.<eos> That's why it's taking so long to do those images.<eos> You've got to let it go.<eos> I know, but you don't know what it's like Toby.<eos> You feel bombarded, you feel burdened by information you don't want, you wish it would stop.<eos> It never will.
- Is me being a bummer helping you feel like your old self?<eos> - Keep going.<eos> - Bush is a war criminal!<eos> There's so much texting going on these days and no communicating.<eos> Carbon tax!<eos> Please leave!<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> Well, I'm off.<eos> - Have a good summer, Jenna.<eos> - Oh, I will.
I told you he was trouble. From the begining.<eos> So let's get him down here, Right now.<eos> It was Zapata.<eos> Look I don't know how many ways I can say this.<eos> You're forgetting who's on trial here.<eos> I'm the one that's put my neck on the line to bring down a guy that you couldn't lay a glove on.<eos> Yeah, when the trial is over. we can show our appreciation.<eos> Well perhaps you could show it now.<eos> I wanted to cook one last supper.<eos> If you will.
Keep collecting rocks.<eos> Hey, Sumida!<eos> What are you doing all wet?<eos> She's here again! Are you dating?<eos> Are you two in love?<eos> Oh, my God, it's late!<eos> I have to go.<eos> Off I go and I'll be back.<eos> Don't come back!<eos> I will!
We should go.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Before you go, hold on.<eos> I got to get this.<eos> All right, prom picture.<eos> Say "cheese."<eos> Cheese.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Be safe, please.<eos> We will.
Really.<eos> And it was fun, wasn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Feeling better about getting married and spending the rest of your life with me and your daughter?<eos> Mm-hmm. Much, much, much better.<eos> Totally ready.<eos> No anxiety.<eos> [chuckles] Me, too.<eos> We're gonna get through all this.<eos> Yeah, we will.
It's taken.<eos> I'm, I'm a nonsmoker, good credit, no pets, call me back.<eos> Nice try, nice try, but I already left a message.<eos> Looks like the bull bucked you off, son.<eos> Okay, Dad.<eos> Um, see, the thing is, a friend really screwed me over and...<eos> I need a place to stay.<eos> And I was supposed to take my senior year off and motorcycle through South America, but some skinny Beverly Hills brat told my parents I was growing pot, so, uh... I'm going to need the place more than you.<eos> So I guess we're just going to have to see who gets it.<eos> Hmm, yeah, we will.
That you keep taking care of the children. And that you let them know who's protecting them inside the court.<eos> Help!<eos> Please, help.<eos> You're not queen anymore. And if you ever were, it was because you were forced to sleep with the king. Like a prostitute.<eos> Leave her alone!<eos> Well, the princess is bossy.<eos> Daughter, go back to your bedchamber, please.<eos> Not until he leaves.<eos> - Will you make me?<eos> - No, but I will.
Defensive wounds consistent with a fistfight.<eos> So there was a struggle before he was killed.<eos> I did find kerf marks on his right acromion.<eos> Ah, very small kerf marks.<eos> And they're on the right greater tubercle.<eos> And on his right olecranon.<eos> The victim struggles with his assailant and then is struck multiple times on the right side, with something that approximates a tiny saw.<eos> Good work, Dr. Edison.<eos> But I have no answers.<eos> You will.
- Let me just take care of this.<eos> What do you care, huh?<eos> What, you the loyal son all of a sudden?<eos> I'm counsel for the club.<eos> If she's really sitting on Bruno's murderer, she's gonna be surrounded by Feds.<eos> You think they're gonna let John Bianchi walk in that door?<eos> Fine.<eos> Do it.<eos> But if I don't have a name by the end of the day...<eos> You will.
You know what they call guys who put down bulls...<eos> Matadors.<eos> Thought you'd figure it out eventually.<eos> No "officer Provenz," is there?<eos> It's just you and me. Right?<eos> Maybe a shovel to dig a hole?<eos> I'm sorry, Vic.<eos> I didn't want it to come to this.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It won't.
Your partner?<eos> That's why she's working with you to take down Division.<eos> Well, her focus has shifted.<eos> She's headed somewhere dark, and I'm as much to blame for that as anyone.<eos> Why doesn't she trust you anymore?<eos> All right.<eos> You take the bed.<eos> I'll take the couch.<eos> If we're gonna take down Gogol, we're gonna need our rest...<eos> Or at least I will.
They're where they always are, in the box.<eos> Right, right, in the box.<eos> Then clean the katana, it's covered in blood.<eos> What's up with you?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Nothing, we'll have to disinfect that wound before sewing it up.<eos> Wait here, Master.<eos> I'll go get some alcohol.<eos> Don't dawdle.<eos> No, I won't.
I have to quickly go back laundry clothes. And hey pup eat food.<eos> Clothes able to tomorrow to wash. Evening go back again hey dog.<eos> My house dog. If not follow time hey it. It just will to go mad.<eos> Then just let it crazy. Dog can crazy to there go.<eos> Your intention my neck. Sorry.<eos> Intention just need not.<eos> You people can participate and will do.<eos> If is not to be orphaned of one's father similar big event just please you remain participate.<eos> Absolutely will not go.<eos> This time, will.
Especially her.<eos> But Bloodgood said we were supposed to do everything we could to make them feel welcome.<eos> - I mean we are the welcoming committee.<eos> - Thanks, Ghoulia.<eos> You know the whole school looks up to you, Cleo.<eos> I mean, if you were to allow Gory and her ghouls to be on the team they would start to emulate you.<eos> Hmm! They do look up to me.<eos> And I am nothing, if not magnanimous.<eos> Very well, they can be on the team, as long as they realize who's in charge.<eos> Oh, they totally will, absolutely.
You'll be all right.<eos> How bad is it, Doc?<eos> Just a flesh wound.<eos> You'll be all right.<eos> Compadre, you'll be all right.<eos> Maybe not point the gun at me.<eos> Put some weight and see how it feels.<eos> Get on out there.<eos> They're not going down!<eos> They will !
My hands!<eos> Can't hold on much longer!<eos> Help!<eos> Hagamar!<eos> Hitch a rope to the horses that we'll used them to pull the wagon.<eos> If you let me out, it will be lighter.<eos> Please!<eos> I can help!<eos> It won't hold!<eos> It will!
As dust before the wind.<eos> As dust before the wind.<eos> Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Rise a knight.<eos> Felson.<eos> What is it?<eos> I know in my heart I have not earned this.<eos> You will.
and I want to be there for her.<eos> so I'm going to that wedding.<eos> then you've won.<eos> as you ... call your office.<eos> I wanted to be here when you arrived.<eos> have to go.<eos> I can not do this anymore.<eos> she deserves better.<eos> and you too.<eos> so I will not.
He has never disappointed me.<eos> The prize is near, Father.<eos> Soon you will have not only the mask, but the blood to fill it.<eos> Marique, how your mother yearned for the sorcery of Acheron.<eos> Imagine the secrets she will bring back from the realm of the dead.<eos> And imagine how indomitable I will become when she's once again by my side.<eos> Father... If the girl is lost, or the ritual fails...<eos> It will not fail.<eos> If it does...<eos> It will not!
- You're still here?<eos> You need to dig up a jacket and tie by tonight.<eos> - What for?<eos> - It's time for your moment in the sun, Cartwright.<eos> It seems that, um, someone talked up our Gary Wyatt Grant winner at the department meeting.<eos> The dean of the Engineering school wants to meet CRU's new wunderkind.<eos> The dean wants to meet me?<eos> What about the winner of the Kettlewell Prize?<eos> Would the dean like to meet him?<eos> He will.
But, well, sorry...<eos> -I was just asking.<eos> -Forthe love of God. man.<eos> Listen, Nuno.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yes. you go home for dinner.<eos> And take the pork sandwiches.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Send my love to Guida and Sarita.<eos> Yes, I will.
Promise me no more slow.<eos> Well, what if it's the good kind of slow?<eos> And realize no matter how long it took,<eos> It was worth the wait.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I spent 18 years Accepting the fact my mother was dead.<eos> I was misguided... to let one of my father's girlfriends Allow me to question that, To hope things may be different.<eos> Your real mother would never turn her back On a chance to know you.<eos> I don't have a real mother, blair.<eos> I never will.
Whose daughter are you?<eos> Her name is Sandy.<eos> I'm Sandy's daughter.<eos> She must have done a real number on you.<eos> Yes, ma'am, she did.<eos> Don't call me "ma'am."<eos> Sorry.<eos> I always wanted a daughter.<eos> You did?<eos> I will, one day.
I'm so happy for you, my dear.<eos> So, brother, do you think there'll be a good dinner?<eos> We'll come straight back if not.<eos> I have made up my mind always to wear black, to free myself from the tyranny of fashion.<eos> But today?<eos> Yes, Aunt, today.<eos> I charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful Day of Judgment, when the secrets of all hearts will be disclosed, if either of you know any impediment why you may not be joined together,<eos> Wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife? I will.<eos> Wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband?<eos> I will.
He never wanted me around that place.<eos> - I'm just not a part of it.<eos> - Well, I am.<eos> It's where I work, and it's my mom's company, and I just gave her all of that money to invest in it.<eos> Rebecca, she was just throwing it out there, all right?<eos> It doesn't mean I'm gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, you say that now, but you know your mom.<eos> She's gonna pressure you into it.<eos> - We're gonna be caught in the middle again.<eos> - No, we won't.
And I would like nothing more than to get him reinstated, but... Casey's status is none of your concern.<eos> There is business to attend to, however, which very much concerns you.<eos> You left your bag in the car on the way back from the airport.<eos> Oh.<eos> So thoughtful.<eos> Good morning, team.<eos> Have you told him anything yet?<eos> Told me what?<eos> After much deliberation, it has been decided that you are ready for a mission that will test everything you have learned thus far.<eos> A final spy test, if you will.
I knocked out his filling.<eos> I knocked off Nick's adult braces.<eos> Us Chase sisters will rough you up.<eos> I know, and it's so exciting we get to do all this fun, couple stuff together.<eos> And look at them-- they're really bonding.<eos> Oh, no, I'd never go surfing.<eos> The ocean is crawling with bacteria.<eos> It's the final resting place of all human waste.<eos> Yeah, I go surfing almost every morning, I haven't gotten sick once.<eos> Oh, you will, Zack.

They were suborn'd.<eos> Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons, are stolen away and fled which puts upon them suspicion of the deed.<eos> 'Gainst nature still!<eos> Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up thine own life's means!<eos> Then 'tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.<eos> He's already named, and gone to Scone to be invested.<eos> Where is Duncan's body?<eos> Carried to Colmekill.<eos> Will you to Scone?<eos> No, Cousin, I'll home to Fife.
If he had been forgotten, it had been as a gap in our great feast, and all-thing unbecoming.<eos> Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir, and I'll request your presence.<eos> Let your highness command upon me.<eos> Ride you, this afternoon?<eos> Ay, my good lord.<eos> We should have else desired your good advice at this day's council... ..but we'll take tomorrow.<eos> Is't far you ride?<eos> As far, my lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better, I must become a borrower of the night for a dark hour or twain.<eos> Fail not our feast.<eos> My lord, I will not.
Thanks to 'coupon privatization ' there is hope for a better future.<eos> The Harvard Funds offer us a chance to invest.<eos> Crime has risen by 50% since last year.<eos> The police want to get tougher in the fight against organized crime<eos> -and continue to...<eos> -...to be corrupt.<eos> Shit, fuck...<eos> You pig, I told you not to eat in my car.<eos> -You'll clean it, you hear me?<eos> -Okay, I will.
No, I-I-I don't understand.<eos> What about all your friends from school?<eos> They'll be anyone's friend... For the night.<eos> I was scared to tell you about N.Y.U. Because I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.<eos> I did everything to try and fit in, but I hate it there.<eos> My girl.<eos> One of the things that make Waldorf women so special is that we don't fit in everywhere.<eos> But I don't feel like I fit in anywhere.<eos> That's 'cause you haven't found the right place yet.<eos> You will.
Besides, I wear makeup.<eos> I wear makeup all the time.<eos> Eh, I don't think so.<eos> I think I would've remembered the look.<eos> Okay, can you just...<eos> Sue, honey...<eos> I think I know what the makeup is about.<eos> When I was your age, I had a friend just like carly who, you know, blossomed before I did and made me feel a little self-conscious.<eos> But it'll happen for you, too.<eos> It will.
Okay.<eos> So if a guy didn't have any of those things, which would you prefer?<eos> The dick, the balls or the asshole?<eos> "Yea, o-e-d...<eos> O-e-d-puss..."<eos> Oedipus.<eos> "My so-very-reg-in..."<eos> Sovereign.<eos> I don't care about these words, team leader.<eos> And I never will.
Too long.<eos> No hard feelings.<eos> I wasn't a boy.<eos> We both knew the game.<eos> I wasn't the one married.<eos> Ah, it would've ended, anyway.<eos> Another one?<eos> I better not.<eos> I don't wanna regret anything in the morning.<eos> I won't if you won't.
Maybe we can have him sit down with a sketch artist.<eos> That'd be a start.<eos> Well, he never got a clear picture of the guy.<eos> All we know is he's white And he's angry.<eos> Yeah, I'm thinking republican.<eos> You guys are serious?<eos> I never said this was going to be easy.<eos> You didn't say it was going to be impossible, either.<eos> I mean, come on, I'm going to need A lot more than just this to go on.<eos> Yes, you will.
- We've discussed it.<eos> And it will not happen again.<eos> I'm glad to hear it.<eos> Look, I just ask that you look at the girls... with an objective eye.<eos> These two days are crucial for them.<eos> I have a totally objective eye.<eos> But you have to know, they pissed off the National Committee.<eos> All right?<eos> I'll give them a good practice today, but tomorrow, they've got to bring their A game.<eos> Oh, they will.
OK?<eos> Good.<eos> Did I mention Marty added a whip to a ful l-in to my floor routine?<eos> That gives me the highest D. O.D. of anyone on the team.<eos> Think again.<eos> Kaylie just added a double Arabian to her floor routine.<eos> Pretty sure that beats your full-in.<eos> What...<eos> Does Marty know about this?<eos> He will now.
Sasha believes that certain events prejudiced the other girls...<eos> Well, is it wise to go over the National Committee's heads?<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> Kaylie's the National Champion and they're treating her like a rookie.<eos> And Emily, let's not forget.<eos> I just think we should be careful before we go alienating the entire gymnastics community.<eos> Well, that's easy for you to say.<eos> Payson's career isn't in jeopardy.<eos> Payson doesn't even have a career right now.<eos> But she will.
Actually it belongs to a guy named Joe Nelson. Come on, you're still running that trick?<eos> Small amusements to keep the day interesting.<eos> Now, what do you want, Caffrey?<eos> I need your expertise on this.<eos> The music box.<eos> You're finally admitting you never had it?<eos> You got closer than anyone else.<eos> We got closer.<eos> But that didn't work out.<eos> Maybe it will this time.
It was so great finally meeting you, Mrs. Heck.<eos> You, too.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey.<eos> Call me. Six weeks.<eos> Her name's Morgan.<eos> I'm gonna snoop out some more information from the other moms.<eos> You work the stands and see if the dads know anything.<eos> Who am I kidding?<eos> They won't.
Grow a pair.<eos> Deal with it.<eos> Uh, I wasn't gonna take you up on it anyways.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> What makes all this worth it?<eos> What makes it worth it is the connection.<eos> It's the bond you feel.<eos> They're yours, you know, and... You're part of them.<eos> Well, what if I don't feel a connection, You know, any--any more than you'd feel to any kid?<eos> You will.
You don't have to choose between being a mom and having to work.<eos> You may not be there all the time, but the time that you do have you can make that count.<eos> It was mine, the pot.<eos> It was mine.<eos> Sorry for not being the girl that you thought I was.<eos> What makes all this worth it?<eos> What makes it worth it is the connection.<eos> It's a bond you feel.<eos> Well, what if I don't feel a connection?<eos> You will.
I don't know what to do with you.<eos> What am I gonna do with you?<eos> Let me go.<eos> You...<eos> You want money?<eos> I'll pay you... whatever you want.<eos> You've seen my face.<eos> You've seen me.<eos> You'll just tell.<eos> No, I won't!
I ran into someone I don't like<eos> Who was it?<eos> My mom's ex, before she married my dad My mom said she'd been with him since she was 16<eos> But one day He left without a word<eos> And disappeared until a few years ago<eos> Are you gonna disappear like him someday?<eos> You're scared that I'll disappear?<eos> Silly<eos> Why call me silly<eos> I won't
- I'm so sorry, May.<eos> Here.<eos> I can't stop crying.<eos> Well, I know it's hard, losing something you felt was right, but sex... is important.<eos> And maybe it's better to end it now before it got serious.<eos> I know I just met him, and that may not make sense to you, but... oh, he was the one.<eos> I've spent my whole life waiting for someone like Henry.<eos> And now he's gone.<eos> But... oh, he still has my heart.<eos> And maybe he always will.
Do you really do it at work?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You didn't break up, did you?<eos> You and Marshall?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Oh, I am so sorry, Ray.<eos> I thought everyone knew.<eos> Give me 20 minutes.<eos> They will.
Y'all sure can talk.<eos> Y'all even make the toilet sound sexy.<eos> You all right?<eos> What is it, your knee?<eos> Always.<eos> Do you want me to take a look?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My vagina hurt, too.<eos> Okay, stop before I have to get the hose.<eos> On that note, I'll, um... Yeah.
Your fncée would like a rd with you.<eos> ck at the inn.<eos> What do you mean, back at the inn?<eos> Allison's not here?<eos> You're not even dresd yet.<eos> Everyone's waiting.<eos> Joe, the girl I've been dreaming about-- e one your cousin strangles-- she's r daughter, Joe.<eos> We don't have a daughter.<eos> I mean, not yet.<eos> But we will.
But she wanted to do this, Eddie.<eos> - She wanted to carry these babies.<eos> You know she did.<eos> - She never wanted to live like this.<eos> Listen to that thing.<eos> It shoves air into her and it sucks it out.<eos> She's hooked up to this, this, a... ll this crap.<eos> That's not life.<eos> I want her to have peace.<eos> - She will.
Look.<eos> Treasure!<eos> Yes!<eos> You told me to never come back.<eos> I know I did.<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> I'm just gonna be here, okay?<eos> I'll jump.<eos> I mean it.<eos> No, you won't.
- Your Majesty.<eos> My beautiful wife.<eos> Now, I must insist you stay to enjoy the dancing.<eos> Boy.<eos> Boy!<eos> I bid you all a good night.<eos> Happy New Year!<eos> Happy New Year, Your Majesty!<eos> I wonder... Will you have some more wine, Lady Anne?<eos> With pleasure, if Your Majesty will. Yes.
What was it?<eos> Just sex?<eos> Is that it?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, yes!<eos> I mean...<eos> I-it was just a moment of weakness.<eos> And I promise you, it will never, ever happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
I can give you anything.<eos> - All I need is...<eos> - My soul.<eos> - You sold your soul?<eos> - More like pawned it.<eos> - I intend to give it back.<eos> - Give it back.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Can't or won't?<eos> I won't, all right?
Sometimes I have dreams that are meaningful.<eos> Last night, I had a dream about you.<eos> Okay.<eos> And I can't really explain why, but I feel very strongly that I'm supposed to tell you something, something important. Are you ready? I'm ready.<eos> Alexander.<eos> Alexander?<eos> Alexander.<eos> I don't know who he is or what he means to you.<eos> I don't know any Alexander.<eos> You will.
Um, nowhere.<eos> I was just<eos> Repositioning you a little bit.<eos> Oh.<eos> We're all good.<eos> Did you find my soldier, mom?<eos> Hmm?<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I gotta find him!<eos> We will.
I hope no one saw us.<eos> Up there - there's a bird and a butterfly!<eos> Two of them!<eos> Oh, not butterflies. They love to talk!<eos> He was cold, so I shared my blanket. Haven't you ever been cold?<eos> Quit snooping and beat it!<eos> And you hit the road too.<eos> I don't want to see you here again.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - No, you won't. Good bye!
Your dreams are all proof of stress likely leading to serious mental deterioration.<eos> So, what did you want to tell me?<eos> Is it about the doctor?<eos> He said that... I'm fine.<eos> Wait a minute, you dreamt Shaw was alive?<eos> Chuck, you saw him die.<eos> I call it the Governor.<eos> It governs my neural network and helps control the power of the Intersect.<eos> Could something like that work for the 2.0?<eos> It will.
We'Il... We'll get back to you.<eos> I'm Lieutenant Terrence Hicks, Mr. Simmons's court-appointed lawyer.<eos> The thing I'd like to point out is that, given the evidence, eight years is reasonable.<eos> I think you should consider it.<eos> Lieutenant, a year ago I came home to find my wife stabbed.<eos> The wife I love.<eos> I've spent the last year trying to convince people that I didn't do it, and when I finally did, when I finally slept at home again, I...<eos> I will not take a plea of eight years.<eos> I did not do this.<eos> I will not.
I think we should just talk tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Look, I'm - - I'm...<eos> It's fine.<eos> Are we okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> You know, you should have a little more faith in me.<eos> I have faith in you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> But you will one day.
Nothing.<eos> I'll talk to you later, okay, baby?<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Oh, eyelash.<eos> Make a wish.<eos> I wish you would stop making things so uncomfortable.<eos> I wish you would accept the fact that Navid is my boyfriend.<eos> That's two.<eos> Things have to change, Javier, I'm serious.<eos> They will.
But maybe the picture's already started to change.<eos> Jane.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, jane, that's me trying to get your attention,<eos> As in "jane, your phone is buzzing."<eos> Oh.<eos> What?<eos> Apparently, jane has to get home.<eos> Well, I hope she has a good night.<eos> I most definitely will.
Do you want me to have meant them?<eos> If they were true, I would want to know.<eos> Of course. *<eos> They bark and scream out for God and their mothers.<eos> Well...<eos> I should get back to Anne.<eos> I meant it, Blair...<eos> With all my heart.<eos> You gonna say something this time?<eos> I will.
- So instead of being helpful, he screwed us.<eos> - That's why I screwed him.<eos> - Well, we still have his sworn confession.<eos> - Buchanan claims we coerced elroy into giving it.<eos> He's moving to have it thrown out.<eos> - And without it, we can't charge petrov With lili's murder.<eos> - How much trouble are you and the judge in?<eos> - Worst we'll probably get is censure From the disciplinary committee, but it's worth it.<eos> - I don't see how.<eos> - You will.
That's really cool-- how did you hear about an underground Ben Harper concert?<eos> Yes, please enlighten us.<eos> You know,<eos> I just, um...<eos> You hear things, you know. You meet people.<eos> Really cool.<eos> So...<eos> I guess I'm cooler than you think, huh?<eos> We will see.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will.
They always believe that I will have mercy.<eos> It is a great moment. When it dawns on them that they cannot escape.<eos> When their eyes go out and die.<eos> You will experience the same thing.<eos> How was it when your sister's eyes went dead?<eos> Harriet vanished. -<eos> - I should believe that?<eos> Believe what the hell you want.<eos> I would have enjoyed killing her, but she disappeared.<eos> Just as you will.
Zoe.<eos> I thought you were brilliant.<eos> You weren't so bad yourself.<eos> Friends?<eos> We're going to have so much fun.<eos> Penelope, congratulations.<eos> Orlando's done so well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will you be staying in town for the master classes?<eos> Yes. Yes, I will.
- You did me a solid by not telling Gretchen what I did.<eos> I'm giving you this as a courtesy.<eos> She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> She cares about you...<eos> She... feel sorry for you.<eos> Okay?<eos> She loves me.<eos> She doesn't even know you.<eos> But she damn well will before the wedding.
Wait a minute, are you saying that...<eos> Simon Lee may not just be a mole working for the sleepers.<eos> There's a chance he's one of them.<eos> We'll take his blood, run a DNA screen.<eos> We'll know the truth soon enough.<eos> I know how difficult this must be for you, sir.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> I'm only too happy to expose whoever this operative is if it gets us further intelligence on the sleepers.<eos> And if he won't talk?<eos> He will.
She's dead.<eos> Your buddy Liam looks good for it.<eos> You know where he is?<eos> Young lady, this is now a murder investigation,<eos> And you are an accomplice.<eos> Just how much jail time do you want to do?<eos> Because every minute of silence Piles on the time!<eos> I want you to think about that.<eos> she'll talk.<eos> No, dad, she won't.
Which one are you freaking out about?<eos> Juliet or Despereaux?<eos> Um, both I guess.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> They really found fingerprints?<eos> A lot of them, Shawn. Why?<eos> Don't you think Despereaux would have worn gloves?<eos> Welcome to the Gordon Mark Hotel.<eos> Will you need help with your bags?<eos> Yes, we will.
Wait a minute.<eos> You better try 10:44, just to be safe.<eos> You've gotta be kidding me.<eos> W-what is... what is... what is that?<eos> Uh, den...<eos> Dennis...<eos> You all right there, buddy?<eos> She doesn't even know that you're asthmatic?<eos> No.<eos> And she never will.
This is an absolutely lovely crime scene you have here, Lassie.<eos> I especially enjoy what you do with the, uh...<eos> What's that called?<eos> Yellow tape. Crime scene tape.<eos> And it's there for a reason.<eos> Look, we only came over to get a closer look at the ride, because I used to have one just like it.<eos> Gus and I built it from scratch in auto shop.<eos> Spencer, you don't want this case. - Oh, but I do.<eos> - But you can't have it.<eos> - Oh, but I will.
And after a day like today, it all gets pretty simple, doesn't it?<eos> They can't take away your talent.<eos> You built this company with your talent and your instincts.<eos> And no one can take those away from you.<eos> But everything is better with you.<eos> Everything is better and everything is safe,<eos> And I can't live without you.<eos> I don't want to, Clay.<eos> You won't have to.<eos> You won't.
Okay, a lot. That is a lot of food.<eos> Seriously, it's just the four of us.<eos> Four and a half, counting the baby.<eos> Five and a half, actually.<eos> I invited Erin. And people always show up.<eos> I'll be happy for leftovers.<eos> I cannot handle any more canned food.<eos> Get out of there.<eos> Don't forget to save the wishbone for me.<eos> - I won't.
No kidding.<eos> That's pretty impressive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess I could keep John, but I just pushed Ben to go back with you, so you probably shouldn't just take off.<eos> You pushed Ben?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Well, I mean, he was hesitating for whatever reason, and I encouraged him to go back with you, and if it doesn't work out, feel free to blame it on me.<eos> This time it'll work out.<eos> Well, if it doesn't.<eos> It will.
Maybe people shouldn't know.<eos> Maybe we shouldn't know.<eos> If that's what Adrian did today, then it's over.<eos> It's between her and God.<eos> It's not for us to judge.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> So we're too late?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I mean, if she did lie and she was pregnant and she did get an abortion, but we don't know that that's what happened, and if she wants to tell us that that's what happened, then she'll tell us, and if she doesn't tell us, then we leave it at that.<eos> Maybe some day she will.
Tell your voters you'd rather topple the government than sacrifice the Opposition over a key issue.<eos> - That's gonna take some swallowing.<eos> - Wash it down with some ice cream.<eos> - But you are funny.<eos> - A scream.<eos> Kasper, my usually smart ex, asked me if I was seeing someone.<eos> Just ignored the question.<eos> I'm turning into a fantastic liar.<eos> My mom doesn't even know you exist.<eos> She will soon, though.
- His wife is unhappy.<eos> - He committed fraud.<eos> And you want me to blackmail him?<eos> The Prime Minister just lost his best adviser.<eos> - How dirty do you think am?<eos> - We stand to take a beating.<eos> This is war.<eos> We can't let a chance like this slip through our fingers.<eos> I'd never forgive myself, if I came to power that way.<eos> In that case doubt you ever will.
I've got a cauliflower for if a vegetarian comes.<eos> With the barbecue lit, we turned our minds to the guest list.<eos> Well, I've invited Harrison Ford, Johnny Depp...<eos> Oh, you invited Johnny as well?<eos> I invited Johnny Depp.<eos> He's been invited twice, but he won't mind.<eos> I've invited her again.<eos> Look, if you invite Angelina, she won't come. She will. - No, she won't.<eos> - We're bigger than ever.<eos> She will.
Prepare to lock on to my signal."<eos> Doctor, what's happening?<eos> "I saved Christmas.<eos> Don't go away."<eos> Doctor?<eos> Doctor!<eos> We good to go, then?<eos> The controls won't respond.<eos> They're isomorphic, tuned to your brainwaves, they'll only respond to you.<eos> They won't.
Are you pushing this because you think They're relevant to this case, Or is it because you feel bad that they've gone missing?<eos> Honestly?<eos> Both.<eos> Where's the harm in letting her follow the thread?<eos> Follow protocol.<eos> And don't get caught.<eos> I can't control whether or not You've been placed in my division, But decisions about my officers are always mine<eos> - I understand.<eos> - I'm not sure that you do.<eos> But you will.
Like it's really... this is the worst I think it's been.<eos> I'm working 9 days... 9, 10, 11, 12... wow!<eos> I am a hair stylist, and at the moment I'm kinda just at a point where I just need a break.<eos> I just need to take a step back and kinda just reevaluate what I really want.<eos> No wonder I'm so grumpy.<eos> Take some time off.<eos> Natalie hasn't quit her job, and it's been a few days, um, of back and forth and, "I'm not sure," an d, "oh, I already did," or, "no, I didn't."<eos> And I'm just like... beyond frustrated.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> I will.
There's no game anymore.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The agency wanted to follow the fake intel<eos> Up the food chain- with him in custody,<eos> Tina varma knows madeline's working for us.<eos> I don't have to give up my life?<eos> No.<eos> But the one I have will never be the same.<eos> No.<eos> It won't.

Watching something unfold on tv. There's going to be this feeling Of guilt for me.<eos> as far as I'm concerned, She's not honoring this Relationship and, you know, in<eos> My opinion, it's over.<eos> no.<eos> It wasn't you that did it.<eos> I feel like I can only blame Myself.<eos> she's got quite a mess to Clean up when she comes back.<eos> I hope she brings a mop and<eos> Coming up, when Andrew left the house last week, He went out way bang.<eos> What drama will this week's
I'll just run it by Kasper.<eos> It corresponds to you buying gas for your state car and Phillip happens to be the CEO of the gas company.<eos> So the press won't give us hell?<eos> - No, your government is exemplary.<eos> There's nothing wrong with it.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Thank you, Kasper.<eos> You might have saved my marriage.<eos> Don't forget to see Thorsen.<eos> - I won't.
Just... give me the room.<eos> How sure are you about this?<eos> Not very.<eos> Like all beliefs, it comes down to a leap of faith.<eos> We do know that Bertha shares some connectivity with the rest of the world.<eos> We've seen evidence of this in the abnormals that reacted to her outbursts, but whether or not she can control the waves is anyone's guess.<eos> Walk me through it.<eos> We induce cardiac arrest, but continue to monitor your brain activity so we can revive you.<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> It will.
Drug dealers are unreliable.<eos> - You could ask Donovan, Jay.<eos> - Unless you're scared of him.<eos> Of course not!<eos> I've had a toke with Mark untold times.<eos> I sort him out with Rizla and ting.<eos> So you're a newsagent now, as well as a liar?<eos> All right, I'll ask Donovan.<eos> Then tomorrow night, when, thanks to me, we're watching Simon get balls-deep in Tara, we'll see who the liar is.<eos> Fine, we will.
- We haven't done anything, have we, Si? - No.<eos> We haven't been anywhere near your Facebook page.<eos> For fuck's sake, what have you done?<eos> Oh, you've changed my profile pic to a fat, naked man and you've changed my status to, "Will is fingering his cat".<eos> - Presumably, you've changed the password too? - Yep.<eos> Do you like the picture?<eos> The knob's a bit big, but other than that, it's definitely you.<eos> Seriously, you've got to tell me the password.<eos> What if my mum sees this?<eos> She won't.
So why would I risk my life for a few bucks?<eos> I charge more an hour than you make in a week.<eos> As an errand boy for drug dealers and thieves.<eos> Maybe you got sick of carrying their water.<eos> You seem to have made up your mind.<eos> You gonna read me my rights?<eos> Offer me a phone call?<eos> I assume you'll want to call your lawyer.<eos> I don't need to.<eos> But you will.
Sleep the sleep of 1,000 martyrs.<eos> Sleep well, my brother.<eos> Sleep well, my sister.<eos> Sleep with my sister.<eos> Sleep well, my brother.<eos> Sleep well, my sister, but please, do not sleep with my sister.<eos> Leave my sister out of it, all right?<eos> Leave my sister alone.<eos> Don't touch her.<eos> Gentlemen, to bed, for at daybreak, I will...
Never settled down, never thinks about the future, just follows his heart wherever it leads him.<eos> Doesn't sound so bad.<eos> Well, it wouldn't be, except he always manages to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Well, I don't think it's his fault this time.<eos> No.<eos> But even if it was, I'd still be there for him.<eos> It's what you do when you love someone, isn't it?<eos> If anything happens to you, I won't forgive myself.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It won't.
Call me big dickey.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - Speak up.<eos> - What do you want, big dickey?<eos> I want you to give this nice man back his article.<eos> [sigh] Okay.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> I will not run the article until you've read it.<eos> And if after you've read it, you don't want me to run it,<eos> - I won't.
I'm sorry.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> Really.<eos> Here.<eos> Thank you, but I really should be getting back.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Of course.<eos> How do you know what the killer's family is thinking?<eos> You said they'll want to apologize?<eos> They will.
- Never punish my kids again.<eos> OK. Put your arms down.<eos> We won't punish them again.<eos> Court in session!<eos> Case 673 year 2009.<eos> Is she present?<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Your lawyer requested to drop the suit?<eos> Will you drop the charges?<eos> No, sir, she won't!
I will communicate with the kitchen.<eos> Pritchard! That wretched animal is going to have to live downstairs!<eos> These came.<eos> From Persie.<eos> "Beloved sis.<eos> Make sure you spoil her.<eos> Smacking kisses, Persie."<eos> It's rather ingenious, sending flowers from Berlin.<eos> You wait. You'll get the bill from Constance Spry tomorrow.<eos> I won't.

I told my brother that we made out.<eos> -That's bad? -No, no, no.<eos> But he... He told my parents.<eos> We're Catholic.<eos> Pete told my parents that you're Jewish.<eos> But I'm an atheist.<eos> I mean, more of a pragmatic nihilist, I guess,<eos> -or an existential pagan, if you will...
- Hello.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> Roger said that you volunteered to take us to the airport.<eos> That's very nice of you.<eos> - Well, I think the plan is...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Don't explain anything.<eos> I know that Roger has a little surprise planned for us.<eos> - I don't want you to ruin it.<eos> - Okay, I won't.
And life is funny.<eos> And you can forget about your food stamps.<eos> I got plenty of money now, Meecham.<eos> I'm buying this place. I'm gonna tend to it, too.<eos> I'm gonna have it up and running in no time.<eos> I ain't seen none of this famous money.<eos> Besides, this place ain't Paul's to sell.<eos> We fixed it up legal.<eos> If I was you, I'd be packing my stuff! We'll see.<eos> We sure as hell will.
Grant.<eos> Sir, it's got us by the balls.<eos> We're trying to find a safe way to shut it down.<eos> Shut it down?<eos> Why the hell would I do that?<eos> Shit!<eos> Listen to me, last week one liberal senator switches her vote at the last minute and mothballs the greatest surveillance tool ever created.<eos> Now we are just 10 minutes away from realizing the greatest security advance in my lifetime and you want to shut it down?<eos> Sir, if we do this, we won't have security.<eos> It will.
Happy New Year.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Keep me close in your heart.<eos> You are leaving.<eos> Listen to me. The worst part of my day is right now. When I have to leave you.<eos> Then don't!<eos> When will you come back?<eos> After the holidays.<eos> I will.

Plenty.<eos> I don't eat much when I'm working.<eos> I'll unpack the rest.<eos> Come on, let's go before you miss your flight.<eos> You'd better call me.<eos> Oh, of course I will.

What reason could I possibly have to kill that girl?<eos> vin, don't say a word.<eos> Are you talking to my client without his lawyer being present?<eos> Now you know better than that.<eos> If Mr. Sheridan is in fact your client, then we have a conflict of interest, don't we?<eos> I know the law, Lieutenant.<eos> Mr. Reyes has been notified.

We strongly advise you to.<eos> It's so gratifying to see you.<eos> I'm proud of you for what you've fought for, your bravey, your willpower.<eos> You're also witnessing a historic moment.<eos> Nina and I have decided to go our own separate ways after many years working together.<eos> Because of life experiences, needs.. .<eos> But especially because we feel deep love and respect for each other.<eos> Nina usually doesn't speak when we say goodbye to a group<eos> But maybe today.. . She says she gets moved and she bursts into tears.<eos> I will today.
I'm just trying to figure out why someone would put a dead body in a freezer.<eos> Is this a Nikki Heat or Detective Beckett question?<eos> Beckett.<eos> The Nikki Heat thing was about incinerating a body in a self-cleaning oven.<eos> I mean, you put things in a freezer to keep them for later, but once they're there, you rarely ever go back.<eos> If I was putting a body in a freezer, it'd be because I was trying to hide it.<eos> Until you stop paying for the storage space.<eos> Did I stop, or did something stop me?<eos> It's family moments like these I will never forget.<eos> With a good therapist, hopefully, I will.
I told you to cut off his head.<eos> But no, you knew everything, didn't you?<eos> Alright.<eos> Alright.<eos> Fine.<eos> Ok? What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> I followed you.<eos> I've been watching you.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> And now Janet will too.

Huh?<eos> Oh, nothin'.<eos> - Hey, Henry? - Yep?<eos> Do you think Ottis will mind that we left him?<eos> No, he needed some time for himself.<eos> I don't think Ottis likes being on his own.<eos> Well, he will now, won't he?
- And I was using that water!<eos> Dam it up again and I'll beat you!<eos> Stop crying or Grandpa will hear.<eos> - It really hurts, Ahmet.<eos> - Sure.<eos> You didn't take your trousers off.<eos> If you'd taken them off it wouldn't hurt.<eos> The pain will go soon.<eos> What if it doesn't?<eos> It will.

Don't move.<eos> - Let me see your hands.<eos> Get down.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Get on the ground.<eos> Hands, now.<eos> Up.<eos> Our turn now.<eos> We get to find out everything you know about Fulcrum.<eos> No, you won't.
This is some automobile you've got here.<eos> Would you believe it only cost me £2.50?<eos> And three tokens from the top of Weetabix packets.<eos> Yeah, I really would believe that.<eos> Come on, come on...<eos> Can you give me a lift on your bike?<eos> It's all part of her grand love note to Ofsted.<eos> It looks good to have a student president.<eos> Will that person have power?<eos> Will they bollocks.
The boat is ready for us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - That boat?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> Would you excuse me for just one moment?<eos> Please?<eos> You warm enough?<eos> Justin, what if we don't get the stone in time and we can't save everyone?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> We will.
Yes.<eos> Only that?<eos> Then I misunderstood?<eos> Yes, Dorcas.<eos> And I shall prove it to you here and now.<eos> Marry me.<eos> Marry me, Dorcas.<eos> Don't say a word now.<eos> I don't have the necessary ring.<eos> But I will, within the hour.
And then I had to find you.<eos> Because?<eos> Because... ..I want you to ask me again.<eos> Ask you?<eos> I want you to ask me again to marry you.<eos> Is that something you can do?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Mma Ramotswe... ..would you be my wife?<eos> Rra Matekoni... ..yes, I will.
You also implied that my plans put a lot of people at risk<eos> - and I agree with you on that one.<eos> - That's a first.<eos> I decided the only way we can break the blockade is if I pilot the Defender right into their battleship and take out the commander.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - This way I'm the only one at risk.<eos> Besides, the Defender is damaged already.<eos> You can't be serious, Master.<eos> - You'll die!<eos> - No, I won't.
I want another chance.<eos> Well, then, you're wasting your time.<eos> I mean, what, did you really expect me to get all swoony just because you showed up?<eos> No, but I thought you might at least...<eos> What, still care?<eos> Look...<eos> Hunter, you had your chance, okay?<eos> Three years ago, I was yours.<eos> Now I want you to go.<eos> Yeah, and what if I won't, Trish?
I'm afraid that no one else is going to believe me.<eos> Please?<eos> Look, I need your help.<eos> The sheriff's on his way over To talk to us.<eos> Does he know anything?<eos> I'm not sure, But... Before he gets here, let's all just...<eos> Okay, we're all upset.<eos> But no matter what happens, let's not forget we have Each other.<eos> We are a family And we will get through this.<eos> No, we won't.
I don't.<eos> I have a few when there's some...<eos> I don't understand it.<eos> Do you want us to stop?<eos> - It's no problem. I'm just asking why you drink so much.<eos> How much?<eos> -Very much, brother<eos> -What's much?<eos> Here... I won't drink anymore.<eos> By God, you will.
Your memory of Terry... rabbit coming back... Mess on the freeway, losing your John Doe. Come on.<eos> You run so fast, all of you, you miss the point entirely.<eos> - There's a point?<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> People get hurt. Some get saved. A lot die.<eos> And it happens all over again.<eos> I should not have come into work today.<eos> You can't pick the days, Nancy, or what happens in them.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
-The bathroom.<eos> Man, this place is awesome!<eos> Over there's RD, and that hallway leads to our testing facilities. Sorry about the shortened tour.<eos> We've been so busy with this software release.<eos> All right.<eos> Right around here is...<eos> Hey, Ted, this is Chuck, our new employee.<eos> Hey, welcome to RI.<eos> Never wash that hand.<eos> I never will, sir.
Split us up ?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Maybe not, I can try to keep you all together, or at least close enough to see each other.<eos> And then think about this: In 5 years,you're 21.<eos> You can get custody of Billy and Gretel, if that's what you want.<eos> No, we're staying together.<eos> I'm not putting them with strangers.<eos> I can take care of them, and as long as they're with me, they'll be okay.<eos> Yeah, but you won't.<eos> Then I won't.
It's my perfect job.<eos> And tomorrow, I get 20 quid to do it all over again.<eos> You go to an old people's home and wank off?<eos> Doesn't that seem weird to you?<eos> Sometimes I even slip a finger up my arse while doing it.<eos> I'm going back tomorrow, you need to find somewhere else to bash one out.<eos> Oh, no, I'll still be there.<eos> Easiest money I've ever earned.<eos> Will won't pay you if he doesn't need you there.<eos> Yes, he will.
Hey, Jim.<eos> - Mrs. Gillum.<eos> - This is my friend, Molly Bechet.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Elliot told me that you have an airline ticket for me?<eos> Actually, there's been a change.<eos> He wants me to drive you instead.<eos> - Where exactly is Mr. Gillum?<eos> - I'd like to speak with him.<eos> You will. Very soon.
How did you find out where I live?<eos> Tell me about the ARC and I'll go away.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What about the creatures?<eos> Haven't you got a drunken pop star to harass?<eos> I'm giving you a chance to comment before I write the story.<eos> Go into print and you'll be laughed out of town.<eos> Not if I er... have the proof.<eos> But you don't.<eos> And you never will.
She needs to see you on the arm of a beautiful woman.<eos> - What is this gonna do?<eos> - It's gonna make her jealous.<eos> - You out on the town with a hot date.<eos> - How are you a hot date?<eos> You're angry at her, not me.<eos> No wonder you're alone.<eos> This isn't working at all.<eos> She doesn't even know we're here.<eos> She will, Brian.
Nothing.<eos> If it's gone, it's gone.<eos> Let's make one.<eos> How?<eos> I'm an electrician.<eos> Not gas?<eos> So sue me.<eos> She'll know for sure.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Yes, she will.
It's okay.<eos> He's just being friendly.<eos> Yeah, papi, chill.<eos> I'm just being friendly.<eos> So how about it ?<eos> Want to come over ?<eos> Oh, not today, hijito.<eos> But once I've moved in,you and your friends should come over here.<eos> Okay, fresa.<eos> We will.

Well, it can't take priority over homicide.<eos> Perhaps Captain Rehder would like to tell mr. Parsall's family that...<eos> Chief Johnson is trying to combine my Officer-involved shooting<eos> - when they are clearly...<eos> - Are you interrupting me? - Are you interrupting...<eos> - I must go first!<eos> My investigation must go first!<eos> These attempts to pull rank are embarrassing, unacceptable, and potentially an obstruction of justice.<eos> I've a federally mandated responsibility to determine why an LAPD Officer discharged his weapon, which supersedes Chief Johnson's objections, as well as yours, sir, - if it comes to that.<eos> - It won't.
Oh, you remember my partner, Detective Lopez.<eos> I'm not sure you two formally met.<eos> My daily activity log.<eos> We were just dropping Nate off- just a way to say thank you for chatting to us about his big brother- and I thought it wouldn't hurt to see if you were free today to answer some questions.<eos> I'm crazy busy.<eos> I need to finish my yogurt... then I was planning on working out-<eos> Well, until your calendar clears up, just know... I'm gonna make my way through every friend, relative and associate you have.<eos> Let me save you some time.<eos> My friends and family don't know anything.<eos> Sooner or later, someone will.
Why not?<eos> You've been running this since they left.<eos> We couldn't narrow it down to under_BAR_500 geographical areas.<eos> Suddenly, you add a parameter to_BAR_the sample space... and it goes down to 20.<eos> I know._BAR_<eos> It's as if they wanted us to find them.<eos> I'm surprised.<eos> About what?<eos> I'm still not getting used to you.<eos> You will.
This is Scorsese.<eos> I am pumped indeed!<eos> Oh, a little heads up - the wife's probably not going to come.<eos> What? Why not?<eos> This is a couples thing.<eos> My wife is very excited.<eos> - As was I.<eos> - What's really going on with you?<eos> - What if your wife doesn't like Marlo?<eos> - Of course she will!
Now attach your harness<eos> No, no, I can't<eos> We'll pull you up. Don't move.<eos> Loic? Loic okey?<eos> Are you okey?<eos> We'll go up and then use the tyrolean Ok<eos> You're tired. Try to relax<eos> And above all, don't move.<eos> Slow down, there's no pitons If you fall...<eos> I won't
Excuse me.<eos> We need some help here.<eos> I got it.<eos> You're buying lunch.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I think it's marvelous the hotel has a nurse on duty.<eos> I'm sorry I puked.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
As soon as you start noticing, you'll have that one sitting on your chair, eating, and putting your son to sleep at night.<eos> This picture is over 15 years old. It is impossible that a present-day child has drawn it; it had to be painted by the murderer himself.<eos> Any clues?<eos> We found something that might interest you.<eos> Let us follow the trail of blood, to see where it leads us.<eos> Murillo, Murillo, son!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Do you enjoy life?<eos> Lucrecia, he is a dangerous murderer; beware of him.<eos> Yes, I will.
- Nothing!<eos> Got rid of the kid and is living it up!<eos> You think I'm the babysitter?<eos> Here, see this?<eos> It's your kid - you take care of her!<eos> Just look at her!<eos> Doesn't even think of showing up!<eos> You want some sweet life?<eos> Not going to work!<eos> - Yes it will.
For your information, I have a hot date that I'm taking to a fundraising dinner.<eos> Really?<eos> What are you, the emcee?<eos> It's black tie.<eos> You know, not all of us spend our free time with our dvd player and a gallon of chocolate ice cream.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> And for your information, it's a gallon of strawberry ice cream.<eos> Oh! Oh, I see.<eos> Well, you have a good night.<eos> I will.
Your mother asked me to take that out the week after we left.<eos> What, you kept it? It's brand new.<eos> I got it in my car.<eos> - I'm selling it online.<eos> - Good for you.<eos> Maybe you can trade it for a dog. I still want a dog.<eos> We're not getting a dog once we get back in the house.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Who knows if we'll get back in the house?<eos> Sure we will.
No, no, don't be.<eos> I kind of liked it.<eos> You did? Yeah.<eos> You... you called me out on my crap, which was exactly what I needed.<eos> And to be honest, I didn't know you had it in you. No, I do.<eos> I mean...<eos> I do.<eos> You haven't seen it very much, that's all.<eos> Maybe I'd like to see more of it.<eos> Maybe you will.
Update your maps, Leblanc.<eos> I want you to mark every center of influence and then update those once a month.<eos> The trick to this job is just getting your face out in the community and then telling them your army story.<eos> Here's your business cards.<eos> Sweet.<eos> Get rid of 'em as fast as you can.<eos> Got it.<eos> For some reason, my brigade commander feels that you're gonna boost our numbers.<eos> So don't let him down.<eos> - I won't, sergeant.
Suite 600 at 4:30, not the other way around.<eos> Please don't contact me again.<eos> - How was your weekend?<eos> - Short.<eos> - What did Michelson think of the contract?<eos> - He hasn't gotten back to me.<eos> That's because he didn't get it.<eos> I called him.<eos> Are you afraid you're going to have a boss?<eos> You will, the client.
- Well, yes.<eos> So do you!<eos> You said you have free will.<eos> Can't you come with me?<eos> God loves you more than I ever could.<eos> You're in his hands.<eos> Shit.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - I don't want to hurt anymore.<eos> - You won't one day.
..revenge...<eos> Yes.<eos> ..we must now conclude that the best rear-wheel drive car that money can buy is the Morris Marina!<eos> Yes!<eos> And do you know what?<eos> What?<eos> I think the Morris Marina Owners' Club are gonna be thrilled with that.<eos> I think it will finally make amends.<eos> They'll forgive us.<eos> They will, finally!
Shh. It's still going.<eos> I need a cab.<eos> I've gotta get out of here.<eos> Oh, my God. Did you follow me?<eos> Wait, let go of me.<eos> So, what's our plan?<eos> Make him confess.<eos> I don't think he's gonna crack that easy.<eos> I mean, what if he figures out we only have a partial recording? That the memory on the phone ran out before the actual murder took place?<eos> He won't.
She is beautiful.<eos> You should come in.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Heading back to the lock now.<eos> Sharon.<eos> Exactly, how long are we suppose to overlook the obvious possibility?<eos> Do you honestly think after all these years in the direction that so clearly pushed us in...<eos> Beta simply wants to strand our spacecraft?<eos> Nothing else makes sense.<eos> Something will.
I don't want to go either.<eos> Have to watch Don Draper accept an award for his humanity?<eos> - Don is important.<eos> - You know, I found that guy working in a fur company, night school.<eos> And that girl, Betty.<eos> I remember Mona said they looked like they were on top of our wedding cake.<eos> - Screw him.<eos> - Have the party without me.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I won't.
Dude, am I seeing what my brain is telling my eyes that they're seeing?<eos> That's me and Ruiz the koala.<eos> I make a yearly donation to the "bear with me" foundation to help protect the lives of these precious and unique creatures.<eos> - You're cuddling the animal?<eos> - We're nuzzling.<eos> And Ruiz made the first move.<eos> {\Here }She comes.<eos> Oh, this is so embarrassing.<eos> Those boys are dumb as rain. See you next week.<eos> Actually, you won't.
And I want you kept in this room under 24-hour guard. What?<eos> Sorry about this, partner.<eos> The frozen yogurt guy's out front.<eos> Did you want to go get one?<eos> Wait, you can't.<eos> These cases offer the most promise. In each of them the perp threatened physical harm against Lassiter{\ in public}.<eos> - All right, let's dig in.<eos> - Are you looking at Palermo?<eos> - Don't forget about Palermo.<eos> - We won't.
It's a cow.<eos> Udders.<eos> "I'm sorry if I upset you.<eos> "Please give me another chance.<eos> "I would hate for my careless gesture "to spoil our fine romance... "<eos> It's the only one they had.<eos> Thank you, Monk.<eos> I realize how hard this must have been for you to have Natalie buy it for you.<eos> Okay, I bought it, but Mr. Monk paid for it.<eos> Or he will.
Her pressure's too low for general anesthesia.<eos> She won't survive.<eos> Then... we won't put her under general.<eos> Andthis goes through the nose to the base of the skull, and then I drill the bone off.<eos> Well, what happens once you drill the holes?<eos> We put miniature staple clips on the vessels.<eos> With what instrument?<eos> We don't have it.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But we will. We will.
Turn this into a proper little office.<eos> I will bring you happiness.<eos> But what's the price?<eos> There's got to be a catch.<eos> With you there always is!<eos> Sarah Jane... ..all you have to say is I do.<eos> And if you don't, you will remain here.<eos> Forever.<eos> Then so be it.<eos> So will Peter.
After watching that prosecutor falling down drunk,<eos> It was like looking in the mirror.<eos> I finally realized I'd done it, I killed her.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I swear I don't know.<eos> Uh, I had no reason to hurt her.<eos> My doctor told me that in an alcoholic blackout,<eos> Maybe I might have known exactly what I was doing,<eos> But the memory never formed,<eos> And it never will.
- Who were you talking to on the phone?<eos> - My sister.<eos> - She a kidnapper too?<eos> - No.<eos> What's this?<eos> Let me go, let us have the money, the girl might live.<eos> Put your hands behind your back.<eos> You are making a bad mistake.<eos> If you people don't let me go right now, Mia Westlake will be tortured to death if they think you've done anything to me.<eos> No, they won't.
I figured what I didn't use, I could take home.<eos> No.<eos> That's not how this works.<eos> Well, it's just that my wife, she puts these in her diet sodas because she likes so much chemicals, you know?<eos> - Then what are the coffee filters for? - Uh...<eos> Why don't you go ahead and put everything back?<eos> Look, it's been a hard month.<eos> Sometimes months are hard. You bring in extra stuff when things are going good?<eos> Well, see you tomorrow, Arch.<eos> No, you won't.
All those morning jogs together.<eos> Who knew that you were running with the devil?<eos> He's not the devil.<eos> Right..<eos> Look, I'm, um..<eos> I'm sorry about earlier today.<eos> I have no idea what got into me, except for three bottles of Pinot Grigio.<eos> That much wine, and I go straight for shock value.<eos> Well, don't worry about it.<eos> I won't.

There are all these boundaries.<eos> Jessica, she's an angel.<eos> Jessica seems like a very private person.<eos> I've drawn her a thousand times.<eos> Memorized every line on her face.<eos> Every expression she makes, every angle of her body.<eos> I'm not sure life here is going to work out for her.<eos> I'm in love with her.<eos> She doesn't know it yet.<eos> But she will.

Or feeling?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Well, Miranda, you're a lawyer.<eos> You know, you can argue both sides of any case.<eos> But why we feel what we feel isn't logical.<eos> It's emotional.<eos> So I'm sorry, Harvard, but I'm afraid you're gonna have to base this decision on your emotions.<eos> Well, then I'm screwed.<eos> I don't know what I feel.<eos> You will.

And now that the weekend's over,I can tell you with what's happened,it's gonna end violently.<eos> We still got a chance to get out of this.<eos> After what you did? What chance?<eos> What you did,too. Remember?<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> Says who,huh?<eos> You?<eos> It's your word against mine,bud.<eos> I just want this to end.<eos> It will,all right?
-All right.<eos> -Kitchen, bathroom.<eos> -l need a drink.<eos> -No, you can't.<eos> -Take me to the bar.<eos> Wow, Andrea, you sure have grown up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> William, right?<eos> My mother was telling me that you got a degree in Finance.<eos> Well, I will in about five months.
Nick, if you ever feel like you wanna come off the streets...<eos> -...you let me know.<eos> All right? -l'm okay.<eos> Thank you, though.<eos> -Just don't forget to do this, all right?<eos> -Okay.<eos> -That's important.<eos> -l'll remember.<eos> -Don't forget.<eos> -l won't.
- Yep.<eos> Just for you.<eos> - That looks so good, boy.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You just wait till she comes back, though.<eos> She's not gonna come back, grandma.<eos> Well...<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yep.<eos> We will.
Okay, so turn so you're facing each other.<eos> Oh, Gina.<eos> Well, we're definitely doing it now, so...<eos> Okay, face each other.<eos> Paul, would you --<eos> Okay, fine, fine, fine.<eos> We'll do an imago.<eos> Okay, move in a little closer.<eos> Who wants to go first?<eos> Me, I will.
Why do birds fly south?<eos> I know the flights are fully booked.<eos> Wrong!<eos> All the other parents get it right away!<eos> You must too!<eos> But there're two of them... and I'm all alone!<eos> I'll give you double the time then, bye!<eos> Bye<eos> Don't forget to pick me later.<eos> I won't!
(Polanski) Of Ben-Hur, you mean?<eos> (James) Granted that it's too easy and a cliché to connect your work with your life in such a direct manner.<eos> Let me take the example of Chinatown.<eos> Chinatown is really a movie about justice not winning.<eos> Is that what you had come to believe?<eos> (Polanski) No, not at all. But if you want your film to serve any purpose, if you want to show injustice or corruption of Los Angeles in that period, you have to show that injustice somehow won and leave them with a feeling of frustration.<eos> I hope you don't mind if I just reach across here and grab a couple of these... - of these nuts.<eos> I will too.
Did you see where he went?<eos> We just drove off.<eos> And did you see anyone after that?<eos> Only"Dog shite on your shoe."<eos> You know, Gunter's son, coming down the hill.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know that old knack you're driving?<eos> Will you take #25 for scrap?<eos> No, I won't.
We neutralised three out of four bombs.<eos> And the Government's grateful.<eos> But you know the policy.<eos> We do not negotiate with terrorists, ever.<eos> With all due respect, Home Secretary, we're not in the House.<eos> You know as well as I do, we started talking to the IRA in 1972.<eos> Don't quote history at me, Harry.<eos> This is different and you know it.<eos> If the Americans got whiff of this...<eos> They won't.
Griffin, I've got good news.<eos> A management-level position has become available, and I've seen that you've been working very hard lately.<eos> I'm recommending you for a promotion.<eos> Will I get to use the executive bathroom?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Holly crap!<eos> You know, last week I ate a fortune cookie that said<eos> "Obvious lesbian will bring great news".<eos> It also said a grand piano would fall on me.<eos> Well, good day to you. And I will...
For the past 13 years, I've never left home without it. Because I know if I forget that, I'll lose my gun, my credentials, my home.<eos> Hold on to it.<eos> I only have 10 months.<eos> I know.<eos> - It's your most prized possession.<eos> - It is.<eos> - You're just giving it to me?<eos> - No. In a couple of months when you get your year, you give it back to me.<eos> - I really don't understand.<eos> - You will.
I don't know who you think you are, and I don't know...<eos> No, I'll tell you who I am.<eos> I'm the five-time winner of the Fort Greene Greater Faith Holy Baptist Temple of Divinity C.O.G.I.C. Easter Spectacular, and I have graced the cover six times of Hat Weekly waiting on the seventh.<eos> Isn't at right, Levin?<eos> Well, Miss Hattie... here's a... a dime.<eos> Oh, what's that for?<eos> For you to call somebody who really cares.<eos> Yeah, because I'm going to... win that competition.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Oh, yes, we will.
I wanted you to understand.<eos> I do.<eos> Finally.<eos> Now I can go.<eos> I wish you didn't have to.<eos> Sara. This is a good thing.<eos> You made me mortal.<eos> Only to lose you.<eos> We should have had more time.<eos> We will.
Well, how much is that going to cost?<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> I don't think the car cost that when we bought it.<eos> No, don't start work on the car, not until you hear back from me.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, that's serendipitous.<eos> Sorry, Ricky.<eos> I'm going to have to call you back.<eos> Um, but I'm very interested.<eos> Okay, I will.
Wait, wait, wait, andi, no, you don't!<eos> All right?<eos> What you saw me doing today,<eos> That was--That--<eos> That was my other job, all right?<eos> Listen, and i need a little time to talk to my boss,<eos> And once i do that, i can tell you the truth.<eos> Sam!<eos> None of this makes sense!<eos> Yeah, but it will!
Hold on, doggie, whoa!<eos> Take it nice and easy-Like, all right?<eos> Oh, she's got nipple!<eos> Ok, ok, calm down, calm down!<eos> It'll be clear to you in a few seconds.<eos> You're going to see proof, ok?<eos> Andi, you remember tony?<eos> Please tell them to let me go!<eos> I do not want to be here.<eos> They will, andi.
Dad, you can't lock me up again.<eos> Hi, son.<eos> Er, no, I know.<eos> I know that.<eos> Just let me go, please.<eos> Well...<eos> Yeah, I-I will, but...<eos> Look... please don't disappear, will you?<eos> You will stay in touch, yeah?<eos> Yeah, I will.
It does require your permission at this early stage.<eos> Well, I think we should do it. I mean, with the hyperbaric treatment<eos> - and Nina's pregnancy.<eos> - Good.<eos> I'll get it arranged right away.<eos> Thanks, Dr. Bruen.<eos> What if they find something wrong?<eos> They won't.<eos> - I wanna have our baby.<eos> - And you will.
Sitting by a lake in the forest in the early morning, drinking tea and Underberg.<eos> Then at some point the ducks fly by.<eos> And then you shoot, that's why you're there.<eos> I think my parents really like you.<eos> They asked us to go with them to the summer house this weekend.<eos> - Okay. What did you say?<eos> - No of course.<eos> Then we'll have the house to ourselves.<eos> If you want to come over mean.<eos> Of course I will.
- What, that living with my mom is okay?<eos> Yes, that too.<eos> Justin, you're a good person.<eos> You're honest and brave and kind.<eos> Look, I feel like Rebecca's only seen this one side of me and I'm terrified that if she sees this other side, that she's gonna...<eos> - She'll what? - She's gonna walk.<eos> She's gonna realize that I'm not good enough for her.<eos> You can't pick and choose the parts of yourself you want Rebecca to see and know.<eos> Shutting her out won't help the relationship.<eos> - What will?
Right.<eos> Welcome.<eos> As you all know, this is the first ever Christmas prom.<eos> Two things are gonna make this event successful:<eos> teamwork and exceptional leadership.<eos> The first thing we need to discuss is the agenda and how that...<eos> - Yes, John?<eos> - Are we gonna have food?<eos> Yep.<eos> Yep, we will.
I thought you said nine years.<eos> I was promoted again this morning.<eos> I'm now director of mail systems.<eos> Nice work, Hornberger.<eos> Are these dolls?<eos> Are they?<eos> Mommy!<eos> They're called little creepers.<eos> Oh, is it so wrong that I just want to have one of these to grow up and resent me?<eos> Oh, you will.
- Elementary, my dear Watson.<eos> - As he's the mayor's brother-in-law, and owns three building companies, he wins all the building contracts, pays the mafia protection money and a share to his brother-in-law.<eos> So the initial contract costs are then doubled.<eos> Right. if poor Spitaleri doesn't do that, he loses out.<eos> Poor thing!<eos> - Bring him in. - Okay.<eos> Mr Spitaleri, come in.<eos> - Have a seat.<eos> - I came as you asked... but I don't know why you've called me in.<eos> You will.
- On your knees.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Spitaleri pays protection money.<eos> - Keep your mouth shut!<eos> Start praying.<eos> Don't kill me, please!<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> - Please, don't kill me!<eos> If you answer my questions, I'll spare your life.<eos> I will.
I'm trying.<eos> But the more I sit here, the more I wanna stand up.<eos> My legs are on fire.<eos> - It's the adrenaline.<eos> - I know it's the adrenaline.<eos> I just have to get up.<eos> They're on fire.<eos> They're full of ants.<eos> If you move. You will die.<eos> We all will.
The men are all sitting around talking shit, and the women are all working.<eos> Brah, if we fight the women instead of the men, we'd get our asses kicked.<eos> Man, they act like they actually want us here.<eos> Let me see under glasses.<eos> Ahh. You have beautiful eyes.<eos> You like boys or girls?<eos> Girls, dawg.<eos> Girls? Phew!<eos> Go with my friend.<eos> You'll like.
Did she comment or ask you anything about the details of your investigation?<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> She said you were a good man.<eos> And that was it?<eos> She offered me a job.<eos> And what did you say to that?<eos> I told her you were gonna give me a raise.<eos> "I acknowledge that by signing this document I waive my constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure."<eos> - I'm not signing this.<eos> - I, however, will.
So, what?<eos> I don't have clearance to know background on a case I'm investigating?<eos> Agent Dunham, if I'm not always completely transparent with you there's a reason.<eos> This little task force you and I call our day job now it sometimes requires some, shall we say, bureaucratic maneuvering to keep it alive and free from meddling.<eos> Which means sometimes I don't tell you everything, for your own protection.<eos> With all due respect, that's not good enough.<eos> Now, I've been trained for a lot:<eos> Hostage crises, terror campaigns suicide bombers, chemical attacks but the things I've seen since I started working for you...<eos> If I'm gonna do this job, I need to know what it is I'm dealing with.<eos> And you will.
- Everyone okay?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Somebody really wantsto keep secret whatever's insidethat suit.<eos> We've run closeto a hundred simulations based on full medical scans of the wraithwe've had in captivity.<eos> They've all been successful.<eos> We both knowvery well that computer simulations and live trialsare very different.<eos> I don't think we'redoing this cavalierly.<eos> I stand by the data.<eos> It will work.<eos> Perhaps it will.
I've been studying the SG-1 report.<eos> This device connects beyond merely psychological.<eos> There's also a physiological connection, as well.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means, should Neeva's body be killed, Jennifer's mind would perish along with her.<eos> And we'll be stuck with this other woman in Keller's body?<eos> - We need to get moving.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> Do we know which planet this device is on?<eos> We will.
Who gives a shit?<eos> you think anyone gives a shit about a billboard?<eos> Wake up, donkeys.<eos> The Internet is where it's at, and I'm going to be an Internet sensation. You're totally right.<eos> If you don't mind, I'm going to come with you.<eos> Maybe I can throw Green Man into a couple of your videos, you know, and work it out. That'll get a lot of hits.<eos> You can help me out, Charlie, but we're not going to put Green<eos> - Man into anything. - Well, we'll see about that.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Well, we will. All right.
Yo ..<eos> You want my body now?<eos> I believe we must know a little better and.<eos> If we do that.<eos> What is your name?<eos> As you want to call me boss.<eos> You know, I think we know enough now.<eos> You are my best love pattern.<eos> You know, I know another slave we can enjoy together.<eos> Will you?
One of those days, huh?<eos> Well, I got a spare.<eos> - Need some help?<eos> - No, it's my job.<eos> My boss is inside.<eos> I better hurry.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> Hey, collateral damage means no paycheck.<eos> - Who's gonna know?<eos> - I will.
What I know is that...<eos> Ariane. You and I...<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> What else is there to say?<eos> That you love her, you imbecile!<eos> Tell her that you miss her, that you're sorry...<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Go on.<eos> Say it.<eos> I will.
I don't know.<eos> On one hand, it could be really cool, but you know how personal that book is.<eos> You know, the stuff with us and Keith.<eos> - Yeah, but it's already in the book, right?<eos> - Yeah, I know. I guess I just feel like I could control the book more.<eos> Well, whatever you decide to do is the right thing as far as I'm concerned.<eos> - Thanks, babe.<eos> - I gotta get going.<eos> Call me when you get there, and be careful.<eos> I will.
Fractured cheek, broken nose...<eos> - left nut swinging solo.<eos> - Yes, it was beautiful!<eos> Yeah, he's lucky to be breathing.<eos> Any luck up north?<eos> Tacoma could help with the Glocks, but there's no M-4s anywhere.<eos> Washington state, Oregon, Nevada, nobody's got stock, man.<eos> We'll have all the Mayan intel by the morning.<eos> We'll get our guns back.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will.
Don't you like me anymore?<eos> It's your turn now.<eos> No, I was not involved in this.<eos> To perform the rituals of The Deadly Charm, you need a photo of someone who died with his eyes open.<eos> I have never hurt you.<eos> I was not involved.<eos> Right, you just stood still and didn't do anything...<eos> And this is what I want you to see.<eos> Look at it!<eos> - No I won't.
Master!<eos> I... did not want to kill him.<eos> Are you begging your life now?<eos> I'm sick of your excuses.<eos> I'lI perform the sword of Yamabe...<eos> Take it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> We'd kill each other for nothing.<eos> please understand, Miss Kotono.<eos> No, I won't !
I don't work for anyone.<eos> Right, but we're the ones who won't be sleeping soundly.<eos> They've ruled out two more voice samples.<eos> We can't depend on those tapes alone.<eos> Perhaps it was Bufalo.<eos> - Any other ideas?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That person going around with Dandi's money.<eos> - Perhaps she can testify.<eos> - No, she won't.
0h, yeah.<eos> Good thing, eh?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What is it?<eos> You've never done it?<eos> Not really.<eos> You'll see.<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> What if somebody comes in?<eos> They won't.
The Saint?<eos> Please.<eos> I mean that's-- that's your nickname, right?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> The Saint!<eos> Dear Jake.<eos> For the record, it's Sinjun.<eos> Sure you don't want anything to eat?<eos> I'm not hungry, thanks.<eos> As you will.
Relax, it's fine.<eos> It's not that.<eos> It's, um after I saw you last night, I met this guy.<eos> We hooked up.<eos> With who?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I was... I was mad at you.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> It'll never happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
I mean, not yet.<eos> Well, maybe I do.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Look, here's what I do know:<eos> I want an experience that I wouldn't trade anything for and I want that experience to be with you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Me too.<eos> With you.<eos> Will you?
You're actually doing it.<eos> You're really communicating with him.<eos> But what's a church and an old room supposed to tell me?<eos> Maybe there's more to the message.<eos> I tried and got nothing.<eos> Stephen's finally ready to listen and I'm letting him down.<eos> When my dad was alive, we used to sit in the gardens at Lancaster Park and talk for hours.<eos> He always told me I could do anything if I just believed.<eos> But what if I fail?<eos> You won't.
Stay there.<eos> Is there press?<eos> Do I need to ask?<eos> They've got us surrounded.<eos> We're bunkered in.<eos> They want a shot of Tom.<eos> Well, at least it's a render that we never quite finished the first war.<eos> I don't think Tom needs any reminding.<eos> Keep calling me.<eos> I will.
Well, her husband's alive.<eos> The old guy's a nutter.<eos> The people who fetched him werert.<eos> Your girl's trying not to go away with you.<eos> That'd be a huge lie.<eos> So, call her. What for?<eos> I'm seeing her later.<eos> What?<eos> She'll come.<eos> She will!
Frank.<eos> Hey, Frank.<eos> Who said that?<eos> I'm Artemis. I'm Dee's friend.<eos> I'm trapped.<eos> I know.<eos> But I can help.<eos> Crawl into my mouth.<eos> I don't think I can fit.<eos> Mmm, sure you will.
- We don't have a choice.<eos> I knew it.<eos> You got no backbone.<eos> Backbone?<eos> You remember how this works?<eos> You hold off the guy in the front, I take the guy in the back.<eos> Mike takes Jenna.<eos> What's missing from this picture?<eos> - The guy that takes Jenna.<eos> - So I'll takeJenna.
The respectability of great power and its games and deals and plunder always beckon.<eos> If these new leaders succumb, their biggest threat may not be from Washington, but from the people on the hillsides.<eos> # I was born by the river<eos> # In a little tent<eos> # Oh, and just like the river<eos> # I been running ever since<eos> # It's been a long<eos> # A long time coming<eos> # But I know a change gonna come<eos> # Oh, yes, it will
# But I know a change gonna come<eos> # Oh, yes, it will<eos> # It's been too hard living<eos> # But I'm afraid to die<eos> # Cos I don't know what's up there<eos> # Beyond the sky<eos> # It's been a long<eos> # A long time coming<eos> # But I know # A change gonna come<eos> # Oh, yes, it will...
But hey, things can change, right?<eos> Is this a show about my childhood or an episode of Dr. Phil ?<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> We have a lot in common.<eos> He gets stuff that you don't.<eos> Like what?<eos> Sickle-cell anemia.<eos> Like, Albert knows what it's like to be the only black kid in school.<eos> And that's something you won't get.<eos> You never will.
Am I right?<eos> You wanna hurt me.<eos> - Do you know why?<eos> - Why?<eos> Because when you grow up you're gonna try to kill me.<eos> Maybe even hurt my family.<eos> How... how do you know that?<eos> I just know.<eos> I - I don't even know your name.<eos> You will.
- Yeah.<eos> - I can't be a witness.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm sorry, I wish could.<eos> - Just put the gun down, honey.<eos> We can figure this out.<eos> Greg, I'm so sorry.<eos> It never should have come to this.<eos> No one is going to believe it was self-defense.<eos> Yes, they will.
We could've had a really great weekend, Sam.<eos> And then you had to get all caught up in your head and make it weird.<eos> No!<eos> I don't think it's weird.<eos> It's the opposite.<eos> It's not weird.<eos> - Yes, it feels weird.<eos> Listen, you're like my best friend, ok?<eos> I really don't want things to change.<eos> And they won't!
It's just that we got a much bigger offer.<eos> From who?<eos> Who did you sell this tape to?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We never even met them.<eos> We just got a phone cal out of the blue giving us instructions.<eos> Put the tape into a postbox,and that was that.<eos> God help me.<eos> Well,i hope this doesn't affect any future business that we might do,mr.george.<eos> Oh,i'm sure it won't.
Not In So Many Words, No.<eos> Well, Go Back And Get It.<eos> I Want You To Have It If You Want It.<eos> I Do. No, You Can't Do That.<eos> You Can't Make Me Feel Bad About Buying A Painting...<eos> I'm Sorry. And Then After It's Gone, Pretend Like You Wanted Me To Have It.<eos> That Is So Controlling.<eos> Well, I Have To Go Have Dinner With Simon Elder.<eos> Be Careful, Nick.<eos> I Will.
We got to find Gordon before somebody else does.<eos> But if it is a ghost...<eos> I'm getting the car.<eos> All I'm saying, if this is some spirit trying to correct a terrible wrong, then you need to confront it and tell it to move on.<eos> If I were a ghost, it would be hard for me to move on, too.<eos> I'm sure it would be.<eos> Keep the curtains closed and the windows locked for the rest of the night.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - I will.
- Why don't you just fuck off?<eos> - Come on. What do you think?<eos> In your heart or hearts, what's your best guess?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Thanks for the ride.<eos> How's Uncle Charlie?<eos> I just came by to say good night to our little Courtney Love in training.<eos> Well, she went to celebrate with her bandmates.<eos> Will you please tell her that I will call her first thing in the morning?<eos> Yes, I will.
THERE WAS JUST NOTHING LIKE THIS<eos> OUT THERE. AND PEOPLE ARE LOVING IT.<eos> I JOINED BECAUSE AS MUCH AS MAYBE I DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT IT, I'M KIND OF VAIN<eos> [ LAUGHS ] AND I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF EVERYONE ELSE THOUGHT I WAS AS<eos> Roberts: WAS IT SOME KIND OF LIKE CONFIRMATION, VALIDATION?<eos> DID IT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD?<eos> OH, I DON'T NEED<eos> CONFIRMATION. I HAVE CONFIDENCE SKIRTING ON THE EDGE OF COCKY.<eos> I ALWAYS HAVE.<eos> I ALWAYS WILL.
Well, there's a shocker. You not being supportive.<eos> Would you shut up and listen?<eos> I'm saying I can't support you going somewhere where you could get shot.<eos> What, are you... Are you worried about me?<eos> Shawn, I've been worried about you since you were three years old and started eating your own toenails.<eos> Well, Dad, I'll be fine, okay?<eos> We're not gonna go anywhere near the house.<eos> And if it'll make you feel any better, I will stand behind Gus the entire time.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, I will.

And look, I know how to use a gun, okay?<eos> I was so careful not to aim at you.<eos> And I came back!<eos> I came back to make sure that you were okay! I did!<eos> And you are, you know.<eos> You...<eos> You're okay.<eos> People need to know what he did to my dad.<eos> People need to know the truth.<eos> They will.
I can already tell you're gonna do quite well for yourself in this town.<eos> That's right. Which means we don't need to see you or your sicko clients any longer.<eos> Have you seen today's Variety?<eos> This sicko has just climbed up another rung on the ladder.<eos> "Bob Easton named CEO after merger."<eos> He told me he was leaving town.<eos> I guess the rush of power is just too addictive to walk away from.<eos> Call me.<eos> I don't need your kind of help.<eos> You will.
System's reset.<eos> Nice work, Fargo.<eos> SRT transfer sequence initialized.<eos> - Beverly, no!<eos> - What the hell?<eos> Damn it, her DNA's already programmed in the system.<eos> She reprogrammed the coordinates.<eos> She could be anywhere now.<eos> - She'll be found.<eos> - No, she won't.
I've got money.<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> Oh, my word.<eos> Oh, my word!<eos> Oh, my goodness me!<eos> Yes!<eos> It's all yours, planet Earth.<eos> Now that's a retirement plan.<eos> But just you be careful, though.<eos> I will. I will, oh, I will!
Have you brought a bag?<eos> No.<eos> Without a bag...<eos> A bag for this gentleman!<eos> - A bag, please!<eos> - Here's the bag!<eos> - Put all the money there.<eos> - Yes, Sir, I'll put it all there.<eos> - Don't answer.<eos> - No, Sir, I won't.
Since little has been teasing me.<eos> My father even beat me with his belt.<eos> And I hung upside down.<eos> So what's new?<eos> I like him I was.<eos> Do you hate your father?<eos> I can not blame him.<eos> Who wants a fairy child?<eos> But you can hide the fact being gay, right?<eos> But I will not.
Any Mock Turtles, wait in the wings till called.<eos> Well done! Well done! Both of you!<eos> Now...<eos> Pauline is to play Alice.<eos> And Winifred will be engaged as understudy.<eos> When I finished my dance, people clapped!<eos> Nobody clapped her. There was just silence!<eos> Dance is important, but Pauline looks right for Alice.<eos> She looks right for everything!<eos> She always will!
Is there a problem?<eos> Yeah. One of your clients. Jessica Taylor.<eos> What about her?<eos> The lady is dead.<eos> What does that have to do with Li-Co?<eos> Someone from this office made threatening phone calls to her.<eos> Yeah. That's their job. Look, I got to get to Dade U, so if...?<eos> I want to know who handled her account.<eos> You got a warrant?<eos> We will in one phone call.
No, thanks, Pre-pubes.<eos> So that's the reason they call you Dick.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's the reason.<eos> Randy Mccormick!<eos> I'm gonna kill you, man!<eos> Wisp, you must follow the sphere of light to a land without color and rescue the seven color kids.<eos> Once there, you will be forever known as Rainbow Brite.<eos> Will you accept this mission?<eos> Yes, I will!
- Too soon to say, but maybe.<eos> - Type and cross, two units.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> She said he was okay.<eos> Like I said, the program is free of charge.<eos> Meets three times a week at the hospital.<eos> If you can commit to that, get weaned off the Vicodin then we can do this.<eos> I don't know, doc.<eos> What if the procedure don't work?<eos> It will.
And you will start paying for the many,many sins against me --<eos> In cash,right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> In my line of work,i realize that i'm susceptible to blackmail,shakedowns --<eos> Whatever you want to call it.<eos> And up to now,i've been accommodating the extortionists in my life.<eos> But today...<eos> Call it bad timing,call it karma --<eos> I've reached a tipping point --<eos> A critical mass,if you will.
She is having a concert on Saturday. I'll talk to Tomica.<eos> After the concert I'll bring her to you.<eos> To Tomica?<eos> -Her manager.<eos> You'd arrange a dinner with Severina for me?<eos> You've saved my life hundreds of times.<eos> Why wouldn't I return the favor?<eos> But, she can't come in here.<eos> Look at the mess.<eos> Of course she will.
Yes !<eos> What a shame...<eos> Already grumpy in the morning...<eos> You should have more composure<eos> Why are you grinning ?<eos> Are you curious ?<eos> I want to know<eos> Then, should I say it ?<eos> But... since my luck could run out...<eos> I won't
Look, let's go inside, all right?<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> Because I needed you to know the truth.<eos> About who I am.<eos> Oh, so it's about you now.<eos> Come on, Rhonda, but...<eos> Well, what are you gonna do about Wallace?<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> 18 months I was in with your brother, okay, and I still never got enough to put him away.<eos> And no one ever will.
- No, no, no.<eos> It was more than a lunch.<eos> It was a test.<eos> Is Charlie Harper capable of stepping up to quality women?<eos> Oh, God, we're back to third person.<eos> Alan, I am tired of having meaningless sex with hot pinheads.<eos> What a coincidence. I'm tired of hearing about it.<eos> Linda's smart, Linda's sophisticated, Linda's successful.<eos> - Linda doesn't like you.<eos> - She will.
In either case, we are here to support you through the illness and separation, whatever you need.<eos> I can't believe you're honestly telling him to leave me. Now.<eos> I'm not telling him to...<eos> You're not still going ?<eos> This is a crisis.<eos> - Karen doesn't want to live alone.<eos> - What do you want, Doug ?<eos> Thank you. But Doug's coming home with me.<eos> He won't be needing therapy anymore. Will you, Doug ?<eos> No. No, I won't.
SHE SAID PLEASE. PASS HER THE PEAS.<eos> I BELIEVE WE PAID FOR 4 YEARS OF COLLEGE.<eos> SINCE I FINISHED COLLEGE. I CAN COUNT.<eos> YOU ATTENDED 3. YES, MA'AM.<eos> I'M GONNA SKIP THE FOURTH.<eos> IS THAT RIGHT? YOU GOT A JOB?<eos> SORTA.<eos> THE LINE BETWEEN "SORTA" AND "YES" DON'T MEET IN THE MIDDLE.<eos> DO YOU HAVE A JOB?<eos> I WILL.

If you withstand the first attack he will move on.<eos> Prepare for the defense well.<eos> I'll do my best, with God's help.<eos> But the cannons....<eos> I took some of your horses<eos> And the cannons...<eos> I need them more than you do<eos> Well, good bye!<eos> Will this do?<eos> It will, it will.
I've been tossed into a storm, trussed up by lawn gnomes, chased by madmen on horseback, how bad can pa-pays be?<eos> I seen them gnaw people in half inside 30 seconds.<eos> Zipperhead, keep your mouth shut.<eos> Kid, you stay behind me.<eos> Why the sudden change of heart?<eos> Believe me, heart's got nothing to do with it.<eos> It came from a young woman.<eos> The othersider.<eos> Do you know who she is?<eos> I will.
Oh,you're good at foisting things off on Shoshanna.<eos> Oh,he's not so ugly. Oh,see?<eos> You made Cricket feel sorry for you.<eos> Me?<eos> -You shouldn't have.<eos> -But I did.<eos> There's something inside.<eos> I want you to be my daughter's godmother.<eos> I want her to have someone who can teach her to live life gracefully.<eos> Will you?
Next week!<eos> I just, I came back to get some things<eos> It's pilot season<eos> There are no Asian guys on television<eos> So, did you tell your father?<eos> Does Addy know?<eos> Anybody?<eos> No, not yet<eos> You figured how to tell them?<eos> No, I will
Well, what do I know?<eos> 'Cause I'm just here to deliver the water.<eos> Dad!<eos> I promised them Cold Stone.<eos> Dad!<eos> To be continued.<eos> Okay?<eos> To be continued.<eos> - Don't move, all right?<eos> - I won't.
It doesn't sound very fun.<eos> He makes me forget about my invalid husband, my loneliness, the dreadful misplacement of my bosoms.<eos> Becky, I don't know how to tell you this, but your bosoms are fine.<eos> There ain't nothing wrong with them.<eos> It's all in your head.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Are you blind?<eos> This one's way up here in Maine, this one's dangling down here in Florida.<eos> All right, well, I'll see you tomorrow, honey.<eos> No, you won't.
I'm always proud to show off our horses.<eos> - You like horses, do you?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> It seems I have a way with them.<eos> - These are all mares?<eos> - Brood mares.<eos> Most of them are due in the spring.<eos> When we get to California, we should have a fine crop of babies.<eos> - I've never seen horses like this before.<eos> - And you probably never will.
- My slaves. No one else's.<eos> What exactly does this initiation consist of?<eos> - Whatever comes to mind.<eos> - And what a mind she has.<eos> - I'd be afraid, girls.<eos> - She's really good at mental cruelty. But she's not above a little physical abuse, either.<eos> You like to get spanked, Danny?<eos> Do you like to get punched, Phil?<eos> It's nice getting to know each other like this.<eos> And we will all during the trip.
Look at that piece of work.<eos> Be reasonable.<eos> I offer you the most beautiful girl in town.<eos> And ammount what you write.<eos> I'm thinking... its nice when man stays to the promise.<eos> Testament.<eos> Promise at all.<eos> I need to show Jasna to grandpa.<eos> What if she don't want?<eos> She will, she will.
- You haven't slept.<eos> - Yes, I have.<eos> "Yes, I have."<eos> "Yes, I have."<eos> - Shit.<eos> - What?<eos> It's still recording.<eos> This is all set.<eos> You'll never get it through the door.<eos> Sure I will.
Are you going to the hospital?<eos> You'd go my trips?<eos> We're buddies, right?<eos> You'd go to Aceguá for me?<eos> Why not?<eos> - Twice a day?<eos> 3 times, if you want.<eos> Cut the crap.<eos> I can even take care of your wife.<eos> Oh you will?
It's nothing just ...<eos> drive safe, okay?<eos> Just to stop it!<eos> Don't tell the paid!<eos> Mr. Wolfare for you on Line 2!<eos> I have to take this!<eos> All right!<eos> Be careful, okay?<eos> Stop it!<eos> I will!
- Station.<eos> Come back.<eos> Everyone's watching I can't get along with him.<eos> This is not a silly game that you get upset and leave.<eos> Come back.. should I fall at your feet?<eos> I'm going to the village.<eos> We'll all go together . and put up a huge board-Shakti factory I don't want any of this.<eos> People will say that you're jealous of him.<eos> Who will say?<eos> - Even I will..
- I didn't see you.<eos> I'm just writing my vows.<eos> Trying to do something appropriate, but also funny.<eos> Not jokey, more character-based humor.<eos> You having an okay time?<eos> Yeah, besides Wizard getting out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> Or else, I don't know.<eos> - We won't. - Right.
Where did you get the money?<eos> Well the stitch won't show, I hope.<eos> Mom, this is a lot of money, where did you get it?<eos> Listen to me! This if you're gonna need it out there.<eos> Mom, can we just stop this for a second, please, this is creepy.<eos> I just want to know you haven't done something stupid.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Then, where did you get the money?<eos> I'm not telling you.<eos> And I never will.
Hey, sweetie.<eos> It's...<eos> It's a blackout.<eos> The whole neighborhood's dark.<eos> Did you guys hear that sound?<eos> They're saying that it's blacked out half the state.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> They don't know what's caused it.<eos> No, well, they...<eos> They will.
Gramms.<eos> Where you running off to?<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mrs. Jenkins down the block called.<eos> Asked if I could read Jane Eyre to her.<eos> Jane Eyre, is it?<eos> I told my gramms I was gonna read Jane Eyre... to this weird lady down the row.<eos> What if she finds out you're not?<eos> She won't.
It's me.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm good, I'm good. Everything okay over there?<eos> Yeah, everything's fine. Where are you?<eos> I'm at a friend's place till I figure things out.<eos> There's nothing to figure out, Son.<eos> You got a family.<eos> Come home.<eos> I will, soon.
You don't look so excited.<eos> I was just thinking, maybe you are right,<eos> maybe uncle MicheaI is not such a good guy after all.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing,really.<eos> Just the race.<eos> He likes these pep talks.<eos> He likes to win.<eos> I need to win.<eos> You will.
Wait a minute.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You're him.<eos> You're the one.<eos> You actually think she loves you?<eos> Can't you see she is using you?<eos> She's using you.<eos> She doesn't love you.<eos> She never has.<eos> And she never will.
It is perfectly ridiculous.<eos> And if I demanded!<eos> It would prove I was wrong in making the slightest promise.<eos> I wouldn't be so silly to keep it.<eos> Please return when I may be visible.<eos> Madame, I cannot wait.<eos> I am, as you say, a spoiled child.<eos> When I want what we speak of, I will have it.<eos> You will have it?<eos> I will.
-I've kept them all.<eos> -I still want you to come.<eos> -Let's see.<eos> -I have to go now.<eos> Mummy, I need you!<eos> Stupendous.<eos> It's stupendous, darling.<eos> Your first play.<eos> Do you think so? Do you think Leon will like it?<eos> Well, of course he will.
Here, Sissie.<eos> Take a tincture.<eos> There.<eos> - I'm sorry, Eddie.<eos> - You have nothing to be sorry for.<eos> I'm afraid taking care of me inspires you to drink.<eos> Writing is your genius... your life.<eos> Please don't destroy them with drink.<eos> Write, Eddie, please... for me.<eos> I will.
It's all you.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> You know we can't do this forever, right?<eos> I know.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's just that I never actually thought about the reality of that, you know?<eos> Because I've been so happy.<eos> We have not been so happy.<eos> Look, the longer that we do this the harder it's gonna be when the inevitable eventually does come.<eos> Which it will.
Sponsorships?<eos> 1.000 Euros minimum.<eos> Aguas Altas is a Portuguese site for the whole world.<eos> Thanks to you, my love, the whole world is watching Aguas Altas.<eos> I still want to close the site.<eos> - You're only pretending? !<eos> - I support the village.<eos> I'm only pretending I want to keep the site.<eos> I don't understand you.<eos> Maybe one day you will.
So, Ian, what's on your mind?<eos> Um... well, you always said if I found something I wanted to devote myself to to come to you.<eos> - Ian's met this girl.<eos> - Let me tell it, Terry.<eos> I have a chance of coming in on a surefire business deal.<eos> Yeah, well, there's no such thing as a surefire deal, but go on.<eos> There's some partners want to invest in two hotels, in your neck of the woods, actually... in-in Los Angeles... - and naturally, this requires an outlay of funds. - Oh, yeah.<eos> Which, of course, you would get back with interest.<eos> If the hotels show a profit.<eos> They will, Uncle Howard.

Let me show you your future under this table here.<eos> I'm sorry, psychic whore, but I've already seen my future. And it's with Debbie Sue.<eos> - Hey, are you ready?<eos> - Hell, I better be ready.<eos> X 90 Armageddons, Yellow Cycle of Thunders,<eos> Nasty Napalmers that'll peel back her eyelids, blow off her silky golden hair, melt her brain stem, and open up her heart.<eos> - And she knows this stuff is coming?<eos> - She doesn't even know my name.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> She will after tonight.
- No, wasn't like you, you mean.<eos> He was not like you! He was better than you!<eos> We as good as brothers since we was kids, and you fuckin'go this way!<eos> What, I'm not as good as you now?<eos> Joe was like blood to me, dog.<eos> As good as fuckin' blood.<eos> You too!<eos> Well...<eos> I would like to catch the motherfucker that did this.<eos> - Oh, we will.
And don't worry, Mr. Hume.<eos> I can't believe I didn't see what was going on with you.<eos> How could you do what you did?<eos> You thought you could... balance the equation... put order in the universe?<eos> I lost our boy.<eos> Your boy.<eos> You are a good father... and nothing that's happened changes that.<eos> I can't agree with what you've done.<eos> And I love you.<eos> And I always will.
Maybe in the summer.<eos> - Can I have a cheese toast?<eos> - I made oatmeal.<eos> Oatmeal?<eos> Why oatmeal?<eos> I hate oatmeal.<eos> Come on, come on, come on.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Have a good day.<eos> - I will.
I don't think in my case it is at all.<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Maureen?<eos> - Shit.<eos> What is it?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Dee just messed up her English test.<eos> I didn't know what the human condition was.<eos> Well, you will soon enough.
the Department of Justice.<eos> No one knows anything.<eos> I No one talks.<eos> Since the 9/11 attacks. Security Services can hold suspected terrorists indefinitely.<eos> -He's not a terrorist<eos> -He's an Arab.<eos> He's a cook!<eos> A German cook wouldn't have this problem.<eos> I don't know what he's accused of.<eos> -You never will
It's not your fault, okay?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Why don't you go see Megan now?<eos> Come sit by me.<eos> I wish we had more time.<eos> I would like to take care of you a little bit longer.<eos> You know, if you think really hard, maybe you could stay longer.<eos> I love you, Davey.<eos> And I will stay with you.<eos> I will.
Taking care of your husband's aunt? Even cleaning her poop? What did I get?<eos> You two inherited this house and you used to come here once... twice a year!<eos> While I was here... cleaning up shit!<eos> What about my retirement plan, Mrs. Luísa?<eos> Who's going to take care of that?<eos> How much do you want?<eos> 200 thousand cruzeiros.<eos> You lost your mind.<eos> Where am I going to get that?<eos> Oh, you will, Mrs. Luísa.
Busy.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> Doing what? - Busy smoking my fag.<eos> - Give us a puff.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - No.<eos> - What if your dad finds out?<eos> - He won't.<eos> He will.
I will take back what is mine.<eos> Knut...<eos> I can understand if you don't want to get involved, but I can't stop thinking of Cecilia.<eos> Cecilia Algots-daughter.<eos> She is promised to someone else.<eos> I will be king.<eos> If I can count on your support, you can count on me.<eos> - How do you know that he will come?<eos> - He will, I am sure.<eos> He will.
Marv was your boy and you just never saw it.<eos> John... John you can't marry her.<eos> Yeah, I know, I know. I mean, for Christ's sakes look at me.<eos> She's a Currie!<eos> What?<eos> She's your cousin.<eos> Her mother Lottie is my father's illegitimate daughter.<eos> I don't even know if she knows.<eos> We've never talked about it.<eos> And we never will.
Great.<eos> The Dark Knight returns.<eos> Batman, I've tapped into air traffic control. Gotham Tower has rerouted all flights.<eos> Good.<eos> You'd think so. But a cargo plane from Africa was already on final approach. It's out of fuel, and its wings are icing over.<eos> Oracle, the Batmobile.<eos> When did this get so hard?<eos> Time, Batman, has made you weak. Slow, irrelevant. Facts you refuse to accept.<eos> Freeze, a man's life is at stake. That plane needs to land.<eos> And land it will.
Sniff into the secrets of my inner life.<eos> But be careful how deep you dig, Vicki.<eos> It might be a dark ride.<eos> Come on, Sarah, it's bedtime.<eos> We have to be up early for the movers.<eos> I'm not gonna move.<eos> I'm staying here.<eos> Honey, you can't.<eos> You'll like where we're going.<eos> I won't!
Set yourself clear.<eos> They want it formatted according to military specs.<eos> Coordinating assault with the cover- attack helicopters from Camp Pendleton.<eos> - When?<eos> - Thirty minutes.<eos> An assault on who?<eos> Assad.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We don't even know where Assad is.<eos> We will.
There has to be a purpose.<eos> That part, I don't know yet.<eos> Trying to balance religion and being zoo...<eos> A lot of that is faith.<eos> Growing up Baptist in a fairly religious household...<eos> I held certain beliefs to my heart.<eos> God doesn't hate anyone.<eos> You treat your fellow man right.<eos> You don't hurt other people.<eos> And for the most part, you'll...
That guy lied and cheated his way through grad school.<eos> We can't exactly be picky now, can we?<eos> He works for Fog financial, for my dad.<eos> It's a job he only has because I put in the good word for him.<eos> I can make him help us.<eos> What are you taking?<eos> The lockbox in question doesn't belong to Fog.<eos> Past two years, it's been the property of a D. Taft.<eos> - We know who that is?<eos> - Not yet. We will.
Are you that bad of a player?<eos> It's the Bob equation I can't quite wrap my head around.<eos> I thought you guys got along.<eos> In a peripheral sense.<eos> When my mom's around,he's easier to tolerate.<eos> But when I think about spending a whole day with him one on one, it kinda makes me wanna throw up.<eos> - You might wanna deal with that. - Ya think?<eos> Anyway,look who's talking.<eos> I don't see you all kissie-kissie with your father figure.<eos> You never will.
And how changed I would actually become.<eos> I don't know what happened to me. Or what it means.<eos> No one does yet.<eos> For right now,<eos> I'm just trying to stay focused on the job taking one day at a time, putting one foot on the other.<eos> Boss, I know where Hyde went on the express elevator floor 1-13 only there is no floor 1-13.<eos> How he accessed it?<eos> No idea.<eos> For what reason, don't know.<eos> But I will.
What pearls of wisdom.<eos> - Okay. Let's see. How you fitting, good?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Confident?<eos> Okay.<eos> - All right. You go get them, tiger.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You look great.<eos> Get the job. Go get it.<eos> - All right. I will.
I was being genuine, hater.<eos> See you later, Rhonda.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I slept out on the street for a week.<eos> You didn't call your mom, did you?<eos> No, why?<eos> She'll send me back to that shelter.<eos> And if I wind up there, Adaleen will get me and have me forcibly impregnated.<eos> I don't think that's gonna happen.<eos> It will.
- What?<eos> - Look, look...<eos> I took a blood test, too.<eos> I didn't want to tell you till I was sure.<eos> - It worked. - Yeah.<eos> My whole life, all I ever wanted was to have a baby and now because of you I can!<eos> God, now I just need to get healthy!<eos> Now I just need to get healthy so I can see the bugger get into an Ivy League school.<eos> Of course you will.<eos> You will.
making the plays.<eos> I don't know, Mickey, he just made it look... so effortless.<eos> And so do you.<eos> Yeah, right<eos> Look, you're not as smooth as Mickey, and things aren't as well planned,<eos> but you're still a bloody genius.<eos> When you say "not as smooth"...<eos> I'm being serious.<eos> You know, if I'm so good, how is it that I haven't got a single clue about what we're going to do tomorrow?<eos> You will.
You should have told me the truth, though.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's not always easy being honest, though, is it?<eos> You ready?<eos> Listen, stop worrying, all right?<eos> She's prime rib.<eos> We show her the clothes, she hands us a check.<eos> It's just too...<eos> - It just has to go right.<eos> - It will.
I'm so sorry.<eos> - You got to calm down.<eos> - She might be primed.<eos> He's not.<eos> We have to get him out.<eos> No, then he's gonna know something's up.<eos> He's gonna know something's up when he sees the clothes.<eos> No, he won't know if we give him the pitch of our lives.<eos> - I can't afford to lose this money.<eos> - We won't.
Don't they have special water?<eos> Distilled or something?<eos> No, no, no, no. That would kill the fish.<eos> So they must shut it down to clean the tank.<eos> No, I checked.<eos> It runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.<eos> It's never been shut down.<eos> So how do they do it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who will?
Yeah, lies to get closer to me.<eos> All my clients have their tactics.<eos> But hers was... insane.<eos> She wasn't lying to you, Jesse.<eos> You have 13 alleles in common.<eos> You killed your mother.<eos> Then take me to jail.<eos> You know, call me a killer... a murderer, whatever, but don't tell me I have a mother... because I don't.<eos> I never did.<eos> And I never will.
We know what kind of-- Is there any satisfaction there?<eos> I don't see-- l don't see any.<eos> I just need one favor from you.<eos> I know it's--of all you've done for me, I just-- give me a shot at it without you, you know, kind of, bein' my backbone.<eos> I need to, kind of, attack it by myself.<eos> It says, "Good luck, Steve, in Donkey Hong."<eos> - All right.<eos> - Hnock 'em dead.<eos> - l will.<eos> - You will.
Chloe, when you get the satellite, make sure we have coverage of that area.<eos> Let Curtis know that he is to intercept Jack somewhere on route 7 on the way to Newhall.<eos> Fayed?<eos> What is it?<eos> Our scout is reporting increased activity around the Palmdale military prison.<eos> The transport buses are starting to arrive.<eos> Good.<eos> By the time my jailed brothers are boarded on the aircraft, it will be too late for the Americans to realize what's happened.<eos> We still don't have the component.<eos> We will.
Is there any chance that Fayed could still be alive and have those four other bombs?<eos> We don't know.<eos> We're running the intel, now.<eos> - And what about Assad?<eos> - He's on his way here.<eos> We're hopping he can help us find Fayed.<eos> Alright, keep me in the loop.<eos> And Bill, please...<eos> - be careful.<eos> - I will.
And an air strike would be the most effective from a political point of view.<eos> It'll show the Russians that we're sparing no effort to destroy the sub-circuit board.<eos> - Send the F-18s immediately.<eos> - Yes, sir, Mr Vice President.<eos> - You'll be all right.<eos> You'll make it.<eos> - Jack, I'm sorry.<eos> - You were following your orders.<eos> - Get the kid. Get the kid, Jack.<eos> - I will.
Clever Daddy.<eos> Why are yous all crying?<eos> It's what he wanted.<eos> How does a guy not feel threatened by mortality when he's lost two ex-closest friends and worst debtors within the space of a month?<eos> How could you? !<eos> What I meant earlier was, it's possible that you're in the throes of a depression...<eos> What you said was dangerously offensive to a man of my constitution. Depressed?<eos> For fuck's sake?<eos> I think what I meant was, a depression by proxy.<eos> A pretend depression, if you will.
Hey, wait.<eos> No.<eos> Coming back.<eos> Hello!<eos> Who's making pancakes? See?<eos> He's great and so's Ted.<eos> Oh, I think he popped it back into joint.<eos> You guys, Turk told me how amazing it was when he saw Izzy's ultrasound.<eos> I can't miss this.<eos> I just... I won't.
He's dead.<eos> No, Molly.<eos> David's alive.<eos> What?<eos> You're sure?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> We'll take you to him. Come on.<eos> He's in that house right there.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
and, and 15 years from now,when he is trapped in a loveless marriage and I have become a cold, hard ice queen for whom love is no more than a distant memory, it will come down to the fact that on this morning,<eos> which coincidentally happens to be my birthday, you obeyed the letter of the law at the expense of simple, human charity.<eos> Wow, that was amazing.<eos> Can I have my letter now?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't know you were a runner.<eos> Yeah,it helps me to work stuff out.<eos> You should try it.<eos> Maybe I will.Everything okay?
It can only come from the police or from us.<eos> - I can access the server...<eos> - Personal mail?<eos> We didn't know he was innocent.<eos> We want it out now.<eos> If you won't do it, we will.<eos> - We want you to wait<eos> - It's not negotiable.<eos> - Waiting Will make a difference?<eos> - Yes, it Will.
What can I do for you?<eos> I want to bring some friends to Atlantis, and apparently I've got to clear it through you first.<eos> Unfortunately, some new security procedures prevent me from allowing any off world visits to Atlantis for the time being.<eos> - On whose authority?<eos> - It was a directive from the IOA.<eos> - Well, they don't need to know.<eos> - Ronon, she's...<eos> I'm sure you understand what a precarious position we're in here.<eos> It is imperative that the location of this base remain a secret.<eos> And it will.
So much for trust.<eos> You tried to ambush us.<eos> I had no intention of causing you harm, but I could not guarantee your cooperation simply by throwing myself at your mercy.<eos> My intent was to have this discussion on neutral ground.<eos> A discussion?<eos> The reason for my contacting you.<eos> I require your help.<eos> We worked together once before.<eos> - Doesn't mean I want to do it again.<eos> - You will.
Who are you becoming?<eos> It's a formal-dress wedding, Bill.<eos> Hello, Nancy.<eos> You look older.<eos> You haven't aged a bit.<eos> We took you into our home.<eos> We loved you like our own son.<eos> I'll never know how much I broke your heart.<eos> -Yes, that's right.<eos> You never will.
You slovenly bitch!<eos> It's peace I need now.<eos> Have your peace then.<eos> But you won't be creeping up to my quarters.<eos> Scorched woman!<eos> One of Péidin's people buried in the Fifteen Shilling Plot!<eos> Clear out of here, you slovenly bitch or I'll tell you in front of the graveyard who you are.<eos> I raised your father since all he could get at home was potatoes and salted milk.<eos> You still haven't a cross as fine as Néra Sheéinin's!<eos> But I will, you slovenly bitch, a cross of island limestone.
Look at Gloria. She's young and nevertheless...<eos> What about you?<eos> Are you going to close the book on Gloria?<eos> No.<eos> I'm going to look her in the eye and say "Thanks for being the mother I lost. "<eos> Thanks for the part I got.<eos> Don't forget, you lived here until only five years ago.<eos> You're selfish.<eos> Will fourthousand euros cover it?<eos> They will.
And I have to talk to him, 'cause maybe I can help him. No.<eos> No, I forbid it.<eos> No, you cannot.<eos> This isn't a stray dog, Melinda.<eos> This guy's trouble, ok?<eos> Let's take a break. I'm thirsty.<eos> I'm really thirsty.<eos> Who wants a drink?<eos> - Not me.<eos> - I will.
You have to know that.<eos> No.<eos> She should have come to me. We should've spoken about it.<eos> She was with another man, Melinda.<eos> There's too much pain.<eos> No.<eos> Tell him...<eos> You tell him he doesn't know what pain is.<eos> None of you do.<eos> But you all will.
There's no way!<eos> Ah, let me see what I can do.<eos> What?<eos> What can you do?<eos> I have a superpower.<eos> Lily is gonna kill me!<eos> Look at me!<eos> She's not gonna want to marry me like this.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Of course she will.
Just like I expected.<eos> You're easy to talk to.<eos> Unlike the other two bastards.<eos> What do we want?<eos> We want you to leave town.<eos> I will.<eos> So don't tell anybody about my past.<eos> Sure, of course.<eos> You're hiding out here because of that boy.<eos> We sure won't.
My wife takes care of everything.<eos> Doesn't she work?<eos> You must be rich!<eos> I wish!<eos> I have to work hard.<eos> But when I get home, everything's neat.<eos> Dinner is on the table.<eos> My wife smells sweet.<eos> We have to take care of what belongs to us...<eos> - because nobody else will.
Look...<eos> I shouldn't be doing this.<eos> I could get in a lot of trouble.<eos> But what can I say?<eos> I got a blind spot for you, Dean.<eos> You're like a...puppy.<eos> You're just too fun to play with.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> You'll bring him back?<eos> I will.
I'm a pretty good shot.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Bennet.<eos> Call me Noah.<eos> Come on.<eos> The guards are coming!<eos> Dad!<eos> Micah?<eos> We have to go.<eos> It won't work.<eos> Yes, it will.
Is he proposing to the girl that you jacked off to this morning?<eos> Yes, as a matter of fact, he is,<eos> But it's OK, because she wasn't offended, She actually said it was flattering,<eos> - That it was flattering?<eos> - Yeah, she did,<eos> - That you were jacking off to her?<eos> - Yes, - She liked it?<eos> - She did,<eos> - OK, I have to meet this girl, then,<eos> - Well, you will tonight,
I'm serious!<eos> If Lineu is entitled to an affair, you're entitled to one too!<eos> Forget that he doesn't love you<eos> Forget that he doesn't want you<eos> Don't you cry, don't hurt like that<eos> Because I can give you eternal love<eos> - Lineu, you gonna just stand there?<eos> - I don't have the right to stop Nenê right now.<eos> - Can't you see she wants to get even?<eos> And she will!
But now...<eos> Look, I'm a little bit busy right now, Sayid.<eos> And I'm trying to get us off this island, Jack.<eos> I can't transmit using this phone because Danielle's distress signal is overriding the frequency.<eos> If you tell me where the radio tower is, I can switch off your message and call for help.<eos> My signal has been playing for the last 16 years and nobody has heard it.<eos> - What makes you think you'll have luck?<eos> - Naomi's boat is 80 miles offshore.<eos> I know if we eliminate Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.<eos> No, they won't.
Left. Left.<eos> - Rose, she's killing you.<eos> - Rose!<eos> - Let me do this.<eos> I need to do this.<eos> Take this.<eos> They'll be drawn to the light, but you won't be able to see without it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - So this thing actually works?<eos> - It will.
You may go.<eos> This unites us forever. Now you'll never be free of me.<eos> I would die for you.<eos> Some day you may.<eos> Inigo.<eos> You must be careful.<eos> For a man, a woman's beauty always ends in tyranny for a man.<eos> 'Tis the law of life.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> You will.
- What? They're just trying to pay you off.<eos> They just don't want you talking about the computer problems.<eos> Gotta let people know the election's a fraud.<eos> - Do you think anybody'll believe you?<eos> - Sure. Why not? Maybe because you flipped out and you're in a hospital and you've been doing drugs?<eos> - I don't do drugs.<eos> - Cocaine... I don't do drugs. I don't do drugs.<eos> I don't. Who believes you? Who's gonna believe you?<eos> ...inner cities, infrastructure, environmental issues - that's what's before us.<eos> He will.
It's never been the same.<eos> I'm damaged goods.<eos> Gosh, Barry, I'm so sorry.<eos> I don't know what I would do if somebody shoved a paddle handle up my ass.<eos> Wasn't the handle.<eos> I've been shitting pancakes ever since.<eos> Mr. Badrinath we are not so different, you and I.<eos> I've had all kinds of things shoved up my ass.<eos> I got over it.<eos> You will too.

Lost much blood?<eos> We'll soon have you comfortable.<eos> Is our concert for the American still on?<eos> Are you up for it?<eos> I was going to tell you.<eos> We've postponed it by two days.<eos> Laurent will be up.<eos> Is it wise?<eos> Will the doctors allow it?<eos> Of course they will!
In the middle of all this shit, your daughter said she wanted to talk to us and we didn't even asked her why!<eos> Do you know if there's any juice left?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Don't you get tired of this rubbish?<eos> - Are you still going away tomorrow?<eos> - Tomorrow night, that's the plan.<eos> I really don't like you travelling at night.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Dad will be sad, you've hardly stayed any time.<eos> No, he won't.
Tasty, huh?<eos> Marlin, don't get me wrong, but you're all pudge.<eos> That thing's gonna get lost in the folds.<eos> I'm not fat.<eos> OK.<eos> I think it's nice, Marlin.<eos> Hey!<eos> You're coming this weekend, right?<eos> - Right. - You Okay-ed it with your aunt?<eos> - I will.
What?<eos> So, can you... huh, get yourself up... and... huh, to class in the morning?<eos> I guess...<eos> Because there's some possibility, that I may be spending the night.<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> Well, have a good night.<eos> And be careful... okay?<eos> 'Cause I worry about you, in that place all alone.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will... Thanks.
You can go on through now, sir.<eos> Let him through.<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> CURTIS: All teams are in position, Jack.<eos> No one moves in until I confirm that it's her.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Collette won't show herself if she senses anything's wrong.<eos> Make sure he stays hidden.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He will.
Lindsay's taking care of the house.<eos> Oh, I forgot about that.<eos> Tell the "housewife" she's not coming either.<eos> If you don't want her, you don't want me either.<eos> She's taking care of me.<eos> She glued my thumb back on.<eos> Sister's my new mother, Mother.<eos> And is it just me, or is she looking hotter, too?<eos> - Well, why don't you marry her?<eos> - Maybe I will!
I know that.<eos> It wasn't you.<eos> It was me.<eos> I may have been out of my mind and not know where I was... Doing or anything, but it was me.<eos> You're in pain.<eos> I know you've been in pain for a really long time.<eos> Don't feel sorry for me.<eos> I care about you.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
OK. What did you argue about?<eos> abigail Zealy?<eos> - No, man.<eos> Just merchandising.<eos> - You argued about merchandising?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Warren thought he deserved 70% for the concept, but I think since I did the drawings, I...<eos> - Do you have a publisher?<eos> - No.<eos> And now we never will.
Now I could only get general rifling characteristics-- six lands and grooves with a right-hand twist, um, but...<eos> But not enough individual characteristics to run it through IBIS.<eos> - Exactly. Sorry, man.<eos> - That's all right.<eos> Hodges.<eos> Your victim did not have GSR on his hands.<eos> Okay, what about metallic trace from the garage floor?<eos> Thank you, Hodges, for performing that incredibly elaborate test requiring copious concentration and an advanced degree.<eos> So you don't have any results from the metallic trace on the garage floor?<eos> But I will.
Um, yeah. Can you sign my form?<eos> My office hours begin at 1 p. m.<eos> - Show up.<eos> - You're gonna tutor me?<eos> Think of it as dance lessons.<eos> After three weeks, I guarantee that you'll pass with flying colors. In fact, I will bet you 10 bucks.<eos> That's is a very generous offer, I just<eos> - I just- I know that you can do this.<eos> I wish I had your confidence.<eos> You will.
Vicky.<eos> Vic, Vic.<eos> I love you.<eos> Sometimes you can be such a little faggot.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I'm gonna get a big boyfriend who'll kick your maniac of a husband's ass.<eos> How do you like that, huh?<eos> How do you like that?<eos> Hey, you're ripping the leather.<eos> Quiet, will you?
Dear...<eos> But we're on the phone now.<eos> Why can't you just ask me now?<eos> Can't Jen, trust me.<eos> Why should I trust you?<eos> Because I know what's good for you.<eos> Listen, you have to be home between 8 and 9 tonight, are you gonna be home?<eos> Okay, this sounds exciting.<eos> It might not happen, okay?<eos> But hopefully it will.
The police are doing everything they can. / Hello.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> Who's calling?<eos> We have your daughter.<eos> - Oh, god.<eos> - What do you want? Wait for instructions.<eos> If you call the police, we will kill her.<eos> Why doesn't he call back?<eos> It's been hours.<eos> He will.
No, no.<eos> We could buy a place down there.<eos> It could be an investment.<eos> We could let it out.<eos> We could also freeze to death on an average day.<eos> No harm in making in enquiries, is there?<eos> CAR HORN Oh, that's Jones.<eos> I'll give you a ring when we get there.<eos> Bye, love. Take care.<eos> I will.
My father did a lot of bad things-- drank, beat up my mom, my brother and me...<eos> That's a real sad story, kid.<eos> The worst thing he ever did... was go away, leave my mom with nothing.<eos> No money, we had no shot.<eos> Any chance we had of a better life... that pretty much disappeared.<eos> What do you want me to do about it?<eos> Make things right with Johnny.<eos> It's a little late for that now, don't you think?<eos> I mean, it's not like Johnny'd ever even know.<eos> Maybe, maybe not, but... you will.
Every day.<eos> EMT says he's gonna make it.<eos> Yeah, I wouldn't be too thankful.<eos> He just killed an innocent man.<eos> I wanted to kill their father a dozen times and I never did, for their sake.<eos> Los Mags should slit his throat from ear to ear.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> She's right, you know.<eos> That prick should die.<eos> He will.
We all know that.<eos> No one's gonna do anything you don't wanna do. I'm talking five minutes, here.<eos> Sam!<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Look, I can't begin to understand what you went through.<eos> - That's right, you can't. - But, Max.<eos> - This has to stop.<eos> - lt will.
I'll bet if we check the copy machine log, it will tell us that copies were made with mrs. Hauser's code, say, 4:03, 4:04 P.M.<eos> Should I call them over?<eos> You're bluffing.<eos> The copy machine can't do that.<eos> Well, here's your choice.<eos> You can call my bluff, and we'll all find out exactly what the copy machine can do.<eos> Of course, if you choose that option, I'm posting this Tritons photo on your home page.<eos> I've heard what happens to Tritons who reveal their secrets.<eos> I don't have a home page.<eos> You will.
But one whom we banished.<eos> And one who's been looking to avenge that for decades.<eos> He's the only one who knows our ways and our desires.<eos> So, what, he's been sabotaging us?<eos> Undoubtedly, so he won't have to answer to us.<eos> Xar would do anything to keep that from happening.<eos> Well, he may have already succeeded.<eos> The Charmed Ones are after you now.<eos> Which means I may never get Billie back.<eos> Yes, you will.
Georgina?<eos> There's something in that house.<eos> What?<eos> It was the boy.<eos> He did this to me.<eos> Georgina, you need to rest.<eos> He's a demon child.<eos> Watch the baby.<eos> She's in danger.<eos> I will.
You never saw what was right in front of you.<eos> She's right.<eos> He sees things, he knows things that he didn't know when he was alive.<eos> And now there's nothing I can do.<eos> It's too late.<eos> No, it's not too late.<eos> He knows that he mistreated you both.<eos> He didn't know how much you loved him.<eos> I still love you, Edward.<eos> I always will.
Anything like that?<eos> / No. I don't appreciate this line of questioning.<eos> You should leave now.<eos> Mr. McKellen, this coat here. Is that the same one that's in the photo here?<eos> Yes. / How'd you get blood on the sleeve?<eos> I had a nose bleed last night.<eos> It's mine.<eos> We're gonna need a DNA sample from both of you.<eos> Then you better get a court order.<eos> - We will.
I'm so sorry, buddy.<eos> Lem, I'm sorry!<eos> But I had to, right?<eos> But you know I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry, man.<eos> Buddy.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> What are we gonna do if Lem doesn't show?<eos> He's gonna show.<eos> He will.
Think about it.<eos> The lake doesn't freeze like that, does it?<eos> It freezes level.<eos> It's nothing to do with hills.<eos> You need four-wheel drive...<eos> Four-wheel drive will give you control in slippery corners.<eos> That's what it's for.<eos> That's why rally cars are four-wheel drive.<eos> You need four-wheel drive. - No, you won't.<eos> - You will.
Uh no, well, we changed the past, we fixed the future and saved the present.<eos> - That's all. - What's that?<eos> Yeah, if you haven't figured it out by now, you probably won't.<eos> Oh, it doesn't matter just as long as everything is back to the way it's supposed to be.<eos> It will be if you got us back.<eos> I mean, otherwise...<eos> How are we gonna get them back?<eos> Oh, I can take care of that.<eos> Yeah, but how will you know when to take them back to?<eos> Oh, the ring will.
Please stop stuffing your face.<eos> - I'm eating away the pain.<eos> - Doesn't this bother you?<eos> Miley, it's been three years.<eos> He's probably lonely.<eos> Well, then we'll get him a puppy!<eos> I hear him!<eos> Look, just remember that whatever happens he can't know we were there.<eos> So just play it cool.<eos> I will, I will.
No.<eos> I'm not that swine! I spit on them!<eos> I was born on their twin planet.<eos> Really?<eos> What's the twin planet of Rexicoricophalvitorius?<eos> - Clom.<eos> - Clom?<eos> Yes, and I'll return there victorious, once I possess your traveling machine.<eos> - Well, that's never gonna happen.<eos> - Oh, it will.
Oh, my god, you're Rory-Rory.<eos> I'm so retarded.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> This was way before you guys started dating.<eos> This was back around Thanksgiving.<eos> Last Thanksgiving?<eos> It meant nothing.<eos> Believe me-- meaningless.<eos> Walker will have sex with anyone.<eos> I will.
Dad, we don't even know what these things are yet.<eos> They were what danny elkins killed best... Vampires.<eos> I thought there was no such thing.<eos> You never even mentioned them, dad.<eos> I thought they were extinct.<eos> I thought elkins and others had wiped them out.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> John: most vampire lore is crap. A cross won't repel them.<eos> Sunlight won't kill them<eos> And neither will a stake to the heart. But the bloodlust
Except it was green.<eos> Okay.<eos> Green plymouth barracuda.<eos> 1970 to '73.<eos> Good news, Harry.<eos> I don't see a lot of 'cudas except on "Nash Bridges" reruns.<eos> Now let's see exactly how many are registered in Neptune.<eos> Exactly none.<eos> But you'll keep looking?<eos> I will.
- Everything okay in here, Abby?<eos> - Yeah, I think so.<eos> We'd be better if you stopped talking when I'm trying to show them how to save his life.<eos> - Listen, Vic...<eos> - I'm all over this.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Go find Neela, please.<eos> Okay, Abby, look.<eos> I can't see it.<eos> - You will, you will.
Like weight- fting ? Like drivi gloves.<eos> Y,bri up the glovesI got off hayden.<eos> He's our man.<eos> I'll tell H.<eos> Greg everest sold you a stolen car, and you wanted him dead.<eos> Look...<eos> I studied business law at harvard for two years.<eos> The judge is never gonna hold me on this, hayden, this is a criminal case.<eos> It's not going to matter.<eos> Oh,yes,it will.
Leukemia has a higher prevalence in both the young and old.<eos> Cameron: So does asthma.<eos> House: No, no, no.<eos> They can both get diabetes.<eos> N o.<eos> The nearly dead and the newly bred have more in common with each other than with people in the middle.<eos> It's weird.<eos> Some kind of circle of life thing.<eos> This kid doesn't have kidney failure.<eos> He will.
When Nikki's body was found, the hot water had steamed up the room.<eos> By the time we got there, the moisture had evaporated.<eos> We didn't miss something.<eos> We just couldn't see it.<eos> So what exactly are we looking for?<eos> Anything the moisture isn't sticking to.<eos> Footprints, handprints.<eos> When you see something, just circle it with the chalk.<eos> So if someone walked in here while it was humid, their footprints would appear under new moisture.<eos> The outlines will.
Never.<eos> He loved me.<eos> For 3 weeks a year.<eos> No.<eos> He loved me all the time.<eos> I was the one who could only manage 3 weeks a year.<eos> I'm afraid that I...<eos> I'm just afraid that I don't have a generous heart.<eos> I'm afraid that I won't have the chance that I had with Kirk ever again.<eos> You will.
I've always just... Just wanted you to be happy... but not with him.<eos> Jonathan.<eos> You know you're the only man I've ever loved.<eos> It's been... so hard without you. Your voice, your touch.<eos> I miss you so much.<eos> I miss you too, sweetheart.<eos> Why did you have to leave me?<eos> I'm sorry, Martha.<eos> I didn't have any choice.<eos> And soon, neither will a lot of other innocent people.
Accusation?<eos> Don't over dramatize.<eos> You'll meet my best friend.<eos> What do you bet?<eos> The vase.<eos> - The vase?<eos> - Your Greek vase.<eos> If I don't meet your best friend by the end of this month, it's mine.<eos> And if I win?<eos> Because I will.
- No, thank you, ma'am.<eos> I thought we talked about that.<eos> Due respect, you may have to get used to it.<eos> Comes with the territory.<eos> So I understand that I need a chief of staff. To do what?<eos> I am not sure.<eos> Again, that gets into the kind of first lady you intend to be.<eos> Please, go on.<eos> Well, there's the activist model, with your own policy agenda and objectives in concert with the president's wishes but not dependent upon his staff for pursuit or implementation.<eos> - A separate power base, if you will.
My semester is about to start.<eos> Will you think of me in New York?<eos> - Yes. - You're so sure?<eos> I wouldn't lie to you!<eos> I remember my own deeds and of course the man I love.<eos> Come on!<eos> Just for my sake!<eos> The world is too big for you to understand me.<eos> I can't give up what I want for others.<eos> I won't
I still have time.<eos> HARRY [LOUDLY]: No, no, I said, what do you think we should do?<eos> -Do you wanna call her?<eos> -Why is he yelling?<eos> He's on the phone with Aunt Linda.<eos> It must be a bad connection.<eos> -Can I feed her?<eos> Is that okay? -Well, of course, sweetheart.<eos> -Just be sure that you support her head.<eos> Okay, I will, yeah. Love to you too, sweetheart.
- What are you doing out here?<eos> - Nothing illegal.<eos> You're digging up a dirt lot in the middle of the night.<eos> We need some ID and a damn good explanation or we're taking your ass in.<eos> On what charge?<eos> / You know the drill.<eos> Assume the position!<eos> Got anything on you, huh?<eos> Doesn't hurt much.<eos> Well, it will.
- That is really not your problem.<eos> - I disagree.<eos> You saw Christina.<eos> That girl had a litter growing inside of her.<eos> You think she could have survived?<eos> - It's not your problem!<eos> - I think it's all of our problem!<eos> And for our kids' sake, just think about what I'm saying.<eos> So does larkin know you're here?<eos> No, but she will.
- Sailors during wartime?<eos> No.<eos> But you are growing up, so I guess I have to get used to that.<eos> - Mr Hall, you took down all your lights.<eos> - Yeah, I thought it would be better.<eos> - I bet it would have worked.<eos> - It might have.<eos> I bet they could have seen us from space.<eos> We'll never know.<eos> Then again, maybe you will.
Tried to kill my sister, too!<eos> Now open the trunk!<eos> I didn't shoot her.<eos> Open the trunk!<eos> If you didn't shoot her, then what's this?<eos> That isn't mine.<eos> You're going to tell me you don't remember showing me that on our first date?<eos> And you used it this afternoon?<eos> ! Hey. You... you have no proof of that.<eos> No, but I will.
You still believe that?<eos> Kolya doesn't know where we are.<eos> If he's wasting manpower that could be used searching for us guarding the gate, the odds of my people finding us are going up and up.<eos> You are more like Wraith than you know.<eos> I'm not sure I like the sound of that.<eos> There is much about Wraith that you do not know, Sheppard.<eos> - Kolya's late.<eos> - That is not like him.<eos> We haven't heard anything from Ladon, either. WEIR:<eos> We will.
Hey, everybody, head upstairs.<eos> Bathroom break, and then free time until the service.<eos> So?<eos> What's to say?<eos> We did our duty.<eos> We sang for some folks, invited them to church. But they shut their doors and went back to their lonely lives.<eos> You... handed out the packets? We did.<eos> That's good.<eos> You know... I'm still not sure what value all this had.<eos> Maybe you never will.
That hasn't always been my experience.<eos> I've done some things.<eos> I know.<eos> No, no, you don't.<eos> But it's okay.<eos> Well, not...nots a secret.<eos> It's not.<eos> I have to be, uh...honest...about myself.<eos> I-I-I have to be able tell someone.<eos> You will in time, Booth.

I mean, I guess there's only, like, a one in 50 chance of me getting the same spoon that he had, but I still don't like them odds.<eos> Oh, I can't bear this anymore!<eos> If Stewie can't find his way out of Meg's ass, we have to enter the other realm and get him ourselves.<eos> Lois, I told you it ain't safe.<eos> I'll tell you what's not safe:<eos> going hunting with Dick Cheney.<eos> So you all set to go hunting?<eos> Sorry, I thought you were a deer.<eos> - Be careful, Lois.<eos> - I will, Peter.
- You don't love me as much as you love Caleb.<eos> You never have.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But it's because he's needed me more.<eos> You are always going to find love in the world.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> He was only ever going to get it from me.<eos> You know, I know you believe that.<eos> That's why I've tried so hard to forgive you. And who knows?<eos> Maybe one day I will.
Does this mean we can't spoon... naked?<eos> Ouch! I'm kidding.<eos> You should come work out with me.<eos> You've got a nice right hook.<eos> Right.<eos> Not as long as you're working out with the Mega-Bitch.<eos> Hey, me and Madison are just friends, alright...<eos> With benefits.<eos> - Does she know that?<eos> - She will.
Big sis, no!<eos> Don't!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It was all my fault.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because I ate your pudding?<eos> Wh-Why what?<eos> Big sis, don't die!<eos> I won't.
- Really?<eos> Because right now it sounds like a threat.<eos> - Tyler, you have to talk to us.<eos> - No.<eos> If we get out of the house, can you make it so their cars can't start?<eos> No, I'm not helping.<eos> Didn't you see what they did to that other girl?<eos> They took her away.<eos> I don't wanna go away.<eos> You will.
You know it's true.<eos> Doug Wilson!<eos> Who's your pal?<eos> Don't you just hate Celia Hodes?<eos> Celia Hodes has Chlamydia.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Job applications.<eos> - You already have a job.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> Soon, you will, too.
Nothing, let's go now.<eos> Kanae!<eos> What?<eos> What this?<eos> Present from me.<eos> I worked for it part-time.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you want me to put on?<eos> Yes, try it! It'll suit you! Right?<eos> Yes, it will!
You let me do this, Robin.<eos> Why did you kill them, Joe?<eos> My Ruth.<eos> She worked all her life in the castle.<eos> When she lay dying, where was the Sheriff?<eos> Did he come and visit?<eos> No.<eos> He sent Joderic because we hadn't paid our taxes.<eos> He put us out and she died like a dog on the street.<eos> And now, so will he.
- He's not a subject.<eos> - See?<eos> You let your heart get in the way.<eos> You know, this humanity of yours has really made a mess of things, hasn't it?<eos> You had to kill Kern and Bunker.<eos> I mean, look what protecting this boy has cost you.<eos> Just tell me where he is and be done with it.<eos> He's gone.<eos> He's gone so far away they'll never find him.<eos> Oh, we will.
I don't remember ever having any.<eos> OK, um, how old are you?<eos> We don't know.<eos> We're guessing around 16.<eos> Where did you live before here?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just don't remember.<eos> It's OK, Kyle.<eos> You will.
Listen, I know it's been difficult for you lately, losing Keith and your heart condition and giving up basketball.<eos> I feel like I've been keeping you close to me to try to protect you from those things, like I'm hanging onto the two of us for you, but not for me.<eos> I'm sorry I kissed Peyton.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> It's not about that, Luke.<eos> It's not.<eos> I mean, I thought that it was, but this is not about her.<eos> This is about me.<eos> I love you, Lucas.<eos> And I probably always will.
Store's closing early today, Picasso. Easy.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> We're just gonna ask you some questions, all right?<eos> Come on. Oh, man, look at that.<eos> You're going out of business, kid.<eos> Where'd you get those bruises, Picasso?<eos> Some dude beat me up. You sure it was a dude?<eos> So?<eos> Yeah, I seen her around.<eos> You won't anymore.
Couple things about Theta Beta...<eos> Their parties are notorious... Nothing but free-flowing booze and boys.<eos> They're totally against school policy.<eos> Alcohol at a sorority party?<eos> Doesn't exactly sound like news.<eos> According to reliable sources... four of them... the Theta Betas get pledges all liquored up, take them to a secret room, and have them undress while the guys from their brother fraternity watch the show through a two-way mirror.<eos> If this Parker girl was there...<eos> You had me at "secret room".<eos> Looks like you'll have a room all to yourself.<eos> I will?
Always has been.<eos> Your loss.<eos> She fucks like a wild animal.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Oh, isn't it my shift?<eos> You're the little shit who smashed my muffin.<eos> Forgive me?<eos> If you let go, I will kill you. I will kill you.<eos> I will kill you, you son of a bitch.<eos> I will... Oh!
Pure luck.<eos> Then they left town, I guess.<eos> And nobody tried to pin the cave-in on them?<eos> Now, why would they try to do that?<eos> Well, from my experience... The best scapegoats are those... who can't speak English.<eos> You know, that's all ancient history.<eos> But they've been finding some damn strange stuff... down in that hole... in the last couple of weeks.<eos> Carvings and such.<eos> I think... something came out of that mine. Something that... never died.<eos> And never will.
You're not killing anybody.<eos> Stay calm, be quiet, stay put!<eos> I'm gonna get you a medicine to treat these wounds.<eos> Dr. Eduardo is gonna thank me for that.<eos> This lobby is so busy tonight!<eos> - Good evening!<eos> - Good evening.<eos> Dr. Eduardo's apartment, please.<eos> I'm gonna kill her!<eos> I will!
Lower your voice.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll shoot.<eos> No, you won't, Sun.<eos> I know you, Sun-Hwa Kwon.<eos> And I know you're not a killer.<eos> Despite what you may think, I am not the enemy.<eos> We are not the enemy.<eos> But if you shoot me... that's exactly what we'll become.<eos> I will.
If you didn't like what your mom bought ask to go shopping again and buy something together.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Damage control.<eos> - Sarah.<eos> - What?<eos> - This is not cool.<eos> - Do you mind?<eos> I'm changing.<eos> I hope your mother doesn't find out about this.<eos> She won't.
He's providing valuable intel on the arms trade among terrorist groups in Eastern Europe.<eos> Was he working for you when he killed a sailor yesterday?<eos> I read the preliminary autopsy report on that, Agent Gibbs.<eos> Seems there's a lack of evidence linking Puchenko to the crime.<eos> He was carrying an illegal firearm.<eos> Not connected to the shooting.<eos> Yet.<eos> Well.. Well, find evidence that he was involved in any serious criminal activity and I promise,... I'll hand him right back to you<eos> Do we have anything yet, Agent Gibbs?<eos> We will.
I wasn't in control, I realise that now.<eos> But even so, I can't...<eos> I have to live with this.<eos> Not what I heard, but what I did to you.<eos> And my betrayal?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm living with mine.<eos> This should be my wake-up call.<eos> I should stop.<eos> But I won't.
Oh, God, please no.<eos> I need a third umbrella.<eos> Hey, maybe we should unplug the cord before...<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I'm leaving it here.<eos> It's yours.<eos> I have returned it.<eos> And somehow or another, I'm gonna get my $3,000 back.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, I will.

It's a nice suit.<eos> You weren't Alden's close friend, Lex, but still...<eos> I should muster up some tears anyway?<eos> Thanks, but I'll save them for someone who deserves it.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> But the best way to deal with them is to leave them behind us, Bury them where they belong... In the past.<eos> Along with everything else, right, dad?<eos> I'm glad you're all right.<eos> - If you need anything...<eos> - I won't.
They brought the TV?<eos> Entry Gentlemen!<eos> The projection will be done as usually!<eos> Come on, turn it a bit!<eos> "Where" does it switch on?<eos> Wait, man!<eos> We have to put it into the plug firstly!<eos> What are you doing there?<eos> It doesn't show!<eos> It will!
Oh, but not yet.<eos> Wait a little while longer.<eos> At least until I can take off these glasses.<eos> Your eyeglasses?<eos> Yes, the doctor told me I can take these glasses off when I'm grown up, and my vision gets better.<eos> What?<eos> I told you before, right?<eos> What I lack, is growth hormone.<eos> Will you really grow up?<eos> Yes I will!
Remember when I almost died of the penicillin reaction?<eos> Don't worry about a thing.<eos> I'll take care of you.<eos> I'll take care of everything.<eos> - What?<eos> I never want to... see you again.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Are you in pain?<eos> - Want me to bring you grapes, or something to drink?<eos> I'll just...
Guys, this is what he wants.<eos> How long have we been down here?<eos> We don't even know where here is.<eos> He doesn't want us to know.<eos> He wants to break us down.<eos> It's called sensory depravation.<eos> It's not going to work!<eos> You hear me, you son of a bitch? !<eos> It's not going to work!<eos> Yes, it will.
I'm fine.<eos> Now isn't a good time.<eos> Do you want me to get you out of here?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You've done enough damage.<eos> Lane, get in here<eos> Lane!<eos> I left so this would stop.<eos> But it didn'T.<eos> It never will.
They turned Sally. They killed anyone they don't need any more.<eos> And they've got all the right gear.<eos> Yeah. I've been thinking...<eos> Is everything OK?<eos> I'm watching the news.<eos> You're part of this, aren't you? Yeah.<eos> Look, I'll be here with Wes.<eos> Just do what you have to do.<eos> And be careful.<eos> I will.
My father was a simple gardener.<eos> Many years he worked the orchards for the Ramirez family.<eos> And when the general took over, he was forced to work with them too.<eos> - [Spanish] - So as a gesture of kindness... they let his daughter get married there.<eos> Forgive Rohan his pride.<eos> You know, a gardener for a father-in-law.<eos> There's no shame in working with your hands.<eos> - Don't forget that, Rohan.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> I will not.
Okay.<eos> So we all have a little healing to do.<eos> I'm not looking for your sympathy.<eos> - So much as?<eos> - Dinner.<eos> Last time you and I had dinner, it turned out to be a terrible idea.<eos> Not for me.<eos> I am a senior partner here.<eos> You say that as if it will get you laid.<eos> It will.
Only thing that'll help your worthless-never-achieve-anything in-your-waste-of-a-breath life is if somebody drowned you in a river.<eos> I'm just giving you a hard time, sweetie.<eos> What you need ?<eos> I'm trying to return this letter for Earl's list, but the address has a Shamrock smudge.<eos> I've been asking everyone in the trailer park to help me figure out who wrote it.<eos> Well, that's easy.<eos> Earl says it's illegal to open other people's mail.<eos> That's the good thing about having three strikes you don't have to worry about the stupid laws anymore.<eos> Wish I had three strikes.<eos> You will someday.
--Mostly.<eos> I gave him a shot for the pain.<eos> Probably fall asleep now.<eos> Is this the guy?<eos> The murderer everybody's talking about?<eos> --He says no.<eos> --Oh, no one's going to believe him.<eos> They're out for blood.<eos> He's not going to get a fair shake.<eos> Yes, he will.
So cake goes there.<eos> OK, so now it's time for the weigh-in.<eos> We're gonna get a new member onto the stage and weigh them. Yes, we are.<eos> So hands up if you are a new member and you'd like to come up and be weighed.<eos> Hands up.<eos> But you will need to be a little bit chunky.<eos> Oh, hello, who we got here?<eos> No, we need a fatty not a twatty.<eos> Oh, my word, are you wedged in or will you be able to?<eos> You will?
Fuck her!<eos> Get the butter.<eos> Die you fucking slag!<eos> I don't know if I left it here, or at the Town Hall,<eos> I really don't.<eos> I'm almost sure I left it...<eos> Mum! My head is fucking splitting!<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> I'll end up dying.<eos> No you won't.
- The baby was exploding!<eos> You ever sit an exploding baby before, Mr Dicker?<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Have you told anyone about this?<eos> - Your parents?<eos> - They thought I was being funny.<eos> But you believe me, don't you, Mr Dicker?<eos> - Sure, kid.<eos> - I wish I could forget the whole thing.<eos> You will, kid.

- Oh no...<eos> - You're telling me!<eos> - Will you help him?<eos> - All right.<eos> I wouldn't recommend it.<eos> Hi Paolo, I'm glad to see you.<eos> - It's been a while.<eos> - I've got so much to tell you.<eos> - Let's hope we find the time...<eos> - We will.
Nikhil Arora ?<eos> Your lady love just stepped off the bus at fisherman's wharf.<eos> I'm sory Amby.<eos> Because ten years from now, when I wake up all alone and ask myself.. why I didn't give Nick and Ambar a chance, I'll have only one answer.<eos> That I'm the biggest idiot in the world.<eos> And I don't want to be with the biggest idiot in the world.<eos> People can change, right ?<eos> You didn't want to mary, now you do.<eos> I didn't want to get married.<eos> ..Amby, will you...
If it were up to me, you would all win first place.<eos> He's just saying that so the losers don't feel bad.<eos> Hi, Nani.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Welcome to our annual May Day Festival, where one of our little girls will be chosen alaka'i.<eos> First up is Aleka, doing the dance of the pineapple.<eos> That should do it.<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> It will.

The magic of theater?<eos> Eva.<eos> We have good news, KaroI.<eos> We've been asked to give three more performances just in one week.<eos> Isn't it wonderful?

Yeah?<eos> Yeah, you just disappeared...<eos> Go back a day early.<eos> Then hide somewhere, and come out after you vanish.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Then they won't worry.<eos> Does that mean I won't get older while I'm here?<eos> No no no...<eos> You'll get older.<eos> Sure you will!
We tried everything.<eos> Radiation, bone marrow transplants... Is he really cured ?<eos> Take him back to his doctor.<eos> Run some tests.<eos> Peter's leukemia is gone.<eos> This is a miracle.<eos> For now, it has to remain a private miracle.<eos> May i remind you that the confidentiality agreement you've signed is strictly binding.<eos> But people should know about that young man.<eos> And they will.
-No, I'll be there.<eos> -Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, I'm sure.<eos> I've got to go.<eos> Good. What else would you be doing except going home to a saddo ready meal for one?<eos> Bit of social intercourse, do you the world of good.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You're right.<eos> I've got a meeting at 7:00, so I'll see you there, :30, 1 0:00?<eos> You will, absolutely.
Sydney Bristow has taken something of mine - an access card.<eos> - I want you to get it back.<eos> - Why?<eos> What is it for?<eos> That's none of your concern.<eos> 48 hours.<eos> - Are you sure this is the right move?<eos> - The right move?<eos> - If they find out what you're up to...<eos> - They won't.
He's incapable oflove!<eos> Rack 'em up!<eos> - [ Carts Crashing] - Stop! -Linda!<eos> -Excuse me?<eos> This is an invitation-only function.<eos> All I ask is thatyou let me say good-bye to Francine.<eos> - [ Moaning ] - No wonder she wouldn't cheat on her husband with another man.<eos> You know, sweeties, this is prettyjuicy dirt we have on her.<eos> - [ Lips Smack] - Okay, Francine.<eos> We'll letyou live.
Not make them have to buy their own supplies.<eos> Not just the painting, the sanding, too.<eos> Yeah, and the taping is very time-consuming.<eos> And Michael decided his father was ready to learn his lesson.<eos> And that is why...<eos> He's got my gun!<eos> It's loaded!<eos> Get away, I'll shoot!<eos> I will!<eos> I will!
- You're fired! - You can't fire me.<eos> I'm your son.<eos> - I'm firing you!<eos> - I was firing Lupe!<eos> Well, that makes more sense.<eos> - Lindsay came upon Lupe, who'djust been fired. - I no clean for family anymore.<eos> Can't you at least come over and DustBuster or something?<eos> - I no does Buster anymore.<eos> - Fine.<eos> I'll DustBuster!
- Rita?<eos> What?<eos> - They're invisible.<eos> - Trevor's the only one who can see them.<eos> - I'm trapped!<eos> Listen, I've got an idea.<eos> Go next to the window.<eos> I'm gonna climb up.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I will!
You really think you'll move here?<eos> Depends on the offer.<eos> I could get you a position at the Jeffersonian.<eos> - Working for my old student?<eos> - Would that be a problem?<eos> Well, we're better when we're not vying for dominance in the same arena.<eos> I can't help it if I'm usually right.<eos> Does that mean you've closed the case on that girl in the fridge?<eos> I found some stress fractures on the wrist.<eos> Not much else. But I will.
Possession of an unlicensed firearm, and carrying a concealed weapon.<eos> Well, like you said, that was two years ago. and you know what<eos> I've paid my debt to society, and I still can't get you guys off my back?<eos> What does a guy have to do?<eos> When does this questioning turn into harassment?<eos> Look, I know my rights. How long are you going to keep me here without charging me?<eos> Horatio, did we get a confession?<eos> To an altercation with Jojo, but not to murder.<eos> Yeah, a search of his possessions hasn't turned up any gun so far.<eos> And it probably won't.
So I take off.<eos> I heard two shots.<eos> He killed him.<eos> That's it.<eos> It's his word against mine.<eos> Now, who are you gonna believe, a felon, or someone who catches them?<eos> I will believe the evidence.<eos> Well, good luck with that.<eos> 'Cause last I checked, you didn't have any.<eos> But I will, Mr. Merrick, I will.
- I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> What?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> This is getting to be way too easy.<eos> Hope!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Actually, not for long.<eos> Okay, you heard me say it, and I meant it.<eos> I do not want anything to do with that box! I swear!<eos> Oh, but you will. In time.
Oh yeah, just get back into it.<eos> - I have a private class at home on saturday.<eos> - Oh, that's great.<eos> Can you believe I've never done yoga before ?<eos> You should come on saturday.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Yeah, join in.<eos> Mickey's joining.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Well, we will.
-Who's that?<eos> -My nanny<eos> My mom's kind of busy today want to see something cool?<eos> Sure<eos> This's wrong,see?<eos> It says "united sates" not "united states"<eos> My mom will fix that<eos> She's the president now<eos> You know,you're never gonna see her again<eos> Huh? You just won't
Stop playing.<eos> Oh,my god.<eos> Dad!<eos> Did elle teach you that?<eos> They're gonna take away my gun.<eos> A profiler is not required to carry.<eos> Yeah? And yet you carry 2 of them.<eos> When I joined the bau,gideon said to me, "you don't have to carry a gun to kill someone."<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - You will.
Don't blame it on me.<eos> I mean, I'm not even that friendly with him.<eos> Yeah, I know him 44 years, but we're not really close friends.<eos> He's more of an acquaintance.<eos> Who gives a kidney to an acquaintance?<eos> I just feel like if we're going to watch DVD's that we should keep the case nearby so we don't end up with just the...<eos> Do you have any sympathy at all for what I'm going through?<eos> It doesn't seem like you do.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, okay, um, yeah, all right, I'll...
You saw my mother die ?<eos> She heard your voice on the answering machine... you told her you were in the library... that you were studying... and she smiled when you said that.<eos> She did ?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You told her that you loved her. And then she picked up a picture of you... and she held it.<eos> Sarah, your voice... was the last thing that your mother heard.<eos> It was your words, "I love you,"... she held inside her heart... the moment that she passed.<eos> What more could a person want, right ?<eos> If only I could make him understand.<eos> He will.
Isn't it time to start the ceremony?<eos> And now, my dear lady... shall I part thou leather lips?<eos> It's the damn underwear.<eos> "Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God... "and in the face of this company... "to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.<eos> "If any man here can show just cause... "why they may not be lawfully joined together... "let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace."<eos> "Whitney Conway Ellsworth... "wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife... "to live after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony?<eos> "Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her... "in sickness and in health... "and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her...<eos> "as long as ye both shall live?" I will.<eos> "Alma Russell Garret... "wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband... "to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony?"<eos> I will.
Then you're making up new liesto cover up the old ones. Pretty soon,you can't turn back,you know?<eos> I do.<eos> When jeannie finally caught on,she took the kids.<eos> She took the furniture.<eos> The bank locked meout of my own house.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's why I can't lose youas a client.<eos> Well,I'm sorry,but you have.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> You'll never losemy friendship,though.
We found that in rex's bedafter he died.<eos> That is his handwriting,isn't it?<eos> You know what I think?<eos> Rex felt guiltyfor the way he treated you.<eos> The adultery,the public humiliations.<eos> That's why he forgave you.He understood why you did it.<eos> How couldhe have believed this?<eos> Look,my wife cheated on me,too.<eos> I know how much it hurts.<eos> And so will a judge.
- Where are they taking my daughter?<eos> - She's going up to the CT.<eos> But what are all those tubes?<eos> Why isn't she moving?<eos> The tube helps her breathe.<eos> It's just a precaution.<eos> Sometimes babies have to be sedated for CAT scans. It doesn't mean anything's wrong.<eos> Have the... police found anything?<eos> It's still early.<eos> They will.
And then can become extremely loving, which we have not seen.<eos> Often has a tendency to repeat statements spoken to them.<eos> - I'd actually say it's more than often-<eos> - Thank you, Jane.<eos> Good job. Good job.<eos> Yes, and let me see, was that Dr. Pratt's extremely efficient teaching? Or was it...<eos> - ...eMedicine?<eos> - She learned about it, didn't she?<eos> She learned the facts, not necessarily how to handle the patients or the family.<eos> She will.
Oh, hey. Are you gonna be in the room when we do it?<eos> I was considering scrubbing in...<eos> Cool.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> Surgeons talk fast. It's part of their training to sound as scary as possible.<eos> He must have graduated top of his class.<eos> Y'know, if you have any questions, Rose, that's why I'm here.<eos> You'll be in the room when they do it?<eos> I will, if you want me to be.<eos> Then I will.
- Oh, there we go.<eos> - Thank you, Arthur.<eos> Brian, will you carry me upstairs?<eos> I want to look at my toys. - No.<eos> I'm watching television.<eos> - Come on, I'm sick.<eos> All right.<eos> Come here.<eos> Oh, Todd, I feel like we'll never have a baby of our own!<eos> We will, Kelly.
Don't let me go.<eos> I can't do this without you.<eos> That's why I have to go.<eos> What is he saying? What...<eos> He's leaving.<eos> Gwen, he's crossing over.<eos> Wait until after I go, and when she thinks of all the things we did, it'll remind her that love is possible.<eos> Conor, don't...<eos> She'll find it again.<eos> I will.
Keep them back until I give the word.<eos> - Okay, guys, we're not... - O'Malley...<eos> I didn't cut the heart or the lungs.<eos> - Dr. Burke, I didn't cut the heart or the lungs.<eos> - Okay, good, good.<eos> Good, O'Malley.<eos> Really good.<eos> Now check for injuries and do a pericardiotomy.<eos> I'll need some lap pads, forceps, metzenbaums and satinsky clamps.<eos> Yes, you will.
You're not my doctor.<eos> You shouldn't even be here.<eos> - She's right. You shouldn't be here.<eos> - She took unauthorized medication.<eos> I'm on the pill and I had grapefruit juice this morning.<eos> Since the juice inhibits enzymes involved in the metabolism of OCPs, I avoided the interaction by taking it two hours after food.<eos> She has a doctorate in neuropharmacology.<eos> - I don't see oral contraceptives.<eos> - Guys.<eos> Now you will.
Sorry, I'm on it.<eos> My bad, Shep.<eos> He was right, wasn't he? Aw, I nodded off.<eos> Come on.<eos> Whatever you got to do to get through the day.<eos> Steph, get me some coffee.<eos> Yes, doctor.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Yeah, not in here, it won't.
How'd you do this ?<eos> I was, um...<eos> I was trying to unscrew a light bulb.<eos> So you're going to the meeting tonight ?<eos> - Hmm, I think so.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Would you mind giving me a lift ?<eos> Well, you know, I just don't think I should drive.<eos> - We should have found it by now.<eos> - We will.
Just before he disappeared, he was behaving oddly.<eos> I mean, oddly for him.<eos> He saw a fake tape of you killing Luthor, freaked out and ran off.<eos> Question, this is Superman.<eos> Come in, please.<eos> Channel's open, but he's not responding.<eos> J'onn should be able to track his location.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'll find you, baby.<eos> Not here you won't.
It's a dead end.<eos> You're not getting in.<eos> We didn't find this by accident.<eos> - We're supposed...<eos> - We're supposed to find this, right?<eos> We're supposed to open it.<eos> Then tell me something.<eos> If we're supposed to open it, why haven't we opened it yet?<eos> - The island will send us a sign.<eos> - "The island will..."
Hey, Jin!<eos> I need you to go to the caves and get Jack. Okay?<eos> Understand?<eos> - We need Jack. - Jack.<eos> Doctor.<eos> - Yes, a doctor.<eos> Please come here.<eos> - Oh, this one's big.<eos> - Don't leave me.<eos> - Oh, no, honey, I won't.
OK, Locke, now!<eos> Pull him.<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> No, it's OK.<eos> We're OK.<eos> - I'm just glad you're safe.<eos> - But, Vincent, he ran off again.<eos> He found his way back to you once.<eos> He will again.
- Just forget about it, OK?<eos> How much weight can this hold?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A lot.<eos> Enough.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tighter.<eos> Got it.<eos> - What if it tips over?<eos> - It won't.
And you were detained by the Secret Service, for heckling the President. What exactly did you say to him?<eos> I stood up and I asked him:<eos> - Why did my son die?<eos> - "Why did my son die?"<eos> And he didn't answer me.<eos> And I asked again.<eos> And again...<eos> And then I was grabbed by the arms and taken out.<eos> Why did you say that to the President?<eos> Because no one else will.
I like it better when you're all mine.<eos> When the girls and I don't have to share you with your dreams, with the cops... with...<eos> You think that makes me profoundly selfish?<eos> Come here.<eos> Hold me.<eos> Help me dream.<eos> He's baaaaack.<eos> I can't believe I'm doing this.<eos> I'm going to lose my job.<eos> No, you won't.
Oh, I almost forgot.<eos> I lied.<eos> There is none.<eos> Please call me back.<eos> That's 20 messages I left.<eos> We should look for him, McGee. Look for who?<eos> We've been calling you for the last hour, boss.<eos> Well, yeah, my ringer thing got turned off.<eos> You're never going to believe who's back in town.<eos> Ari. Maybe you will.
Let him go, baby.<eos> Just let him go.<eos> It's a quarter past.<eos> She said she'd be here at 4:00.<eos> It's called making us sweat.<eos> Look, we don't know why Ms. Rivers is coming.<eos> It may have nothing to do with the face mask.<eos> And if it does, we'll just play dumb and tell her to talk to our lawyer.<eos> We have a lawyer?<eos> We will.
But it turned out I didn't do such a bad job.<eos> - You mean compared to me?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean as evidenced by you.<eos> We're all terrible mothers.<eos> You go into the enterprise... expecting your child to be a better version of yourself.<eos> And then, the little bastards turn out to have souls all their own... destinies to be fulfilled... dreams and desires that have nothing to do with us or our DNA.<eos> I mean, I...<eos> I carried him inside of me, and... it's as if I don't even know him.<eos> You will again.
Nobody serious ever wants that job.<eos> -Actually, I'm running for president.<eos> -President?<eos> -I've been president since 7th grade.<eos> -Really?<eos> -What was your name again?<eos> -Erica Marsh.<eos> -No, doesn't ring a bell.<eos> -Don't worry.<eos> It will.
He does hear our prayers, you know-- the Lord. Yes.<eos> On behalf of Lincoln.<eos> All who seek forgiveness will be delivered. Yes.<eos> If your brother accepts the Lord, he'll be free of this cage forever.<eos> - It can't bind him. - Yes.<eos> I'll be available through this whole thing, if you need me.<eos> Reverend...<eos> Reverend, would you give this to my brother?<eos> It'd mean a lot to him, knowing it came from me.<eos> I will.
Why, just imagine.<eos> The Chinese say they're going to land a man on the moon by the year 2020.<eos> What will that be like, do you think?<eos> Inspiring.<eos> As we reach toward space, we also look inward.<eos> The unlocking of the human genome... will allow the birth of perfect babies in the future.<eos> Why, think of a world without disease... or midgets... where every child is perfect in every way.<eos> Sieg heil!<eos> And would you believe that as high-speed internet access improves... doctors can perform complicated surgeries without leaving the beach?<eos> You will.
Yeah?<eos> Lisa's brother-In-Law, what was his name?<eos> Hoyt.<eos> Did they ever determine for certain if he was involved in Lisa's death?<eos> - Dad<eos> - No no, it's all right.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Look, with both Lisa and hoyt dead,<eos> They don't know for sure.<eos> And no one ever will.
Oh, my little girl.<eos> Maya?<eos> Maya, are you okay?<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> She's so beautiful.<eos> Hi.<eos> We've never met.<eos> I'm Nathaniel.<eos> I love her so much.<eos> And I always will.
ho, ho, ho, lex.<eos> any reason we couldn't have met at the mansion ?<eos> i don't make house calls.<eos> you want to utilize my skills, you come to me.<eos> that is, if you really want to bring down jonathan kent.<eos> and i'm assuming you have some kind of grenade to launch at him.<eos> not yet... but i will.
Look, it won't take long. I'll be in and out.<eos> The quickest way to figure out what is going on in there is to to tap into the system and communicate directly with the Captain!<eos> Need I remind you of the obvious value in this?<eos> But is it safe?<eos> Would I be volunteering to go if it wasn't?<eos> No.<eos> Which is exactly what makes it safe enough for me to go.<eos> What?<eos> Better to have you on the outside, in case something goes wrong.<eos> - It won't!

You're friends with that Hailey girl, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Ranger... Wilkinson.<eos> Well, I will tell you exactly what I told her.<eos> Her brother filled out a backcountry permit saying he wouldn't be back from Black Water until the 24th.<eos> So it's not exactly a missing persons now, is it?<eos> Tell that girl to quit worrying.<eos> I'm sure her brother's just fine.<eos> We will.
It's good.<eos> Save room, I've got a half-gallon of that fudge brownie ice cream.<eos> I don't know, I'm pretty stuffed.<eos> -You sure?<eos> -Maybe after I poop.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> -We're eating dinner.<eos> -He had dinner an hour ago.<eos> -Well, then he won't need breakfast.<eos> -Yes, I will.
Woman, you are light.<eos> You are lighter than Michael Jackson, you so light.<eos> - Where is my money?<eos> - Shane broke his arm last night.<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> - Where is my money?<eos> - I'll get it, I swear.<eos> I need more inventory.<eos> I'll pay everything back.<eos> Sure, you will.
- Something happen to your eye?<eos> Well, you should see the other guy.<eos> - Where are you staying, at a hotel?<eos> - On Calle Ocho.<eos> Got a suitcase.<eos> Pack it.<eos> Airport, if I can find it.<eos> - I'm gonna remember this.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> Yes, I will.
Sokka...<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> You're not old enough to go to war, Sokka, you know that.<eos> I'm strong!<eos> I'm brave!<eos> I can fight!<eos> Please, Dad!<eos> Being a man is knowing where you're needed the most... and for you right now that's here protecting your sister.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Someday you will.
Please hire me as a mechanic.<eos> I want to learn much more about racing.<eos> I don't wanna go!<eos> Why don't you want to go to school?<eos> My hair clip broke.<eos> It's a big deal for Aoi, isn't it?<eos> To Aoi, when something breaks, it means that something bad is gonna happen.<eos> Nothing's going to happen.<eos> Something will!
Cool.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Inside this skull is another universe... the biggest, scariest haunted house of them all.<eos> Elmer, will you hurry up and tell Dr. Hook how profound he is... so we can get inside this poor guy's noggin and reduce the cranial pressure?<eos> Anyway, after I've paused to reflect on the gravity of what it is I am about to do... and only after I've done that, do I proceed with my mission.<eos> Yes, Doctor.<eos> Steady as you go, Otto.<eos> Patient to Nine, Neuro.<eos> Standing by. You'll be fine, Mrs. D.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Aren't they really excellent?<eos> Very nice.<eos> Jesse, if this works out, the Rickmans are in a position... to give Kingdom Hospital a great deal of help.<eos> Filthy rich, are they?<eos> - I don't know if I'd say that, exactly, but...<eos> - No, but just between us?<eos> - Excuse me, Jesse.<eos> I've got to run. - Have a great day.<eos> - Have yourself a "morning air" day.<eos> - I will.
The call to work on TV, that clown pretending to help me.<eos> All fakes.<eos> Just like the fake money.<eos> And it's always my fault. Because I'm stupid. I always get my hopes up.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're just in the dumps.<eos> But we'll get through it.<eos> -No, we won't.<eos> -Why not?<eos> Of course we will.

-Sign here.<eos> RRemember my uncle who can recall his past lives?<eos> You believe him?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's a true story.<eos> He was 90 years old when he came to our house.<eos> He could recall 200 years.<eos> I don't want to remember that long.<eos> 'Cos you don't have good memories.<eos> From now on I will.
Forget it.<eos> It was really lucky you didn't get in.<eos> You're far too good for them.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> You know, it was meant to be because something else is coming.<eos> Are you sure you sent the tape?<eos> - No, I haven't sent the tape.<eos> - You haven't sent it?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> But I will.
I think she must have killed around 30 people.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe she took contraceptives.<eos> I know.<eos> She had to kill 20 at least.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> The Hand of God.<eos> You know what that is?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You will.
I love you madly.<eos> May I?<eos> That's Patricia.<eos> Look how straight she sits.<eos> You learn that in haptonomy.<eos> It helps find the center of gravity.<eos> How time flies!<eos> We have to take her back later.<eos> If you're tense, Lola will sense it.<eos> No, she won't.
There's a great article in there comparing today's quarterbacks with Johnny Unitas.<eos> Unitas would kick their butts.<eos> So, this is your sales pitch?<eos> I've been with the magazine for 20 years.<eos> I believe in it.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> So, are you worried about all these rumors that your parent company is about to be sold?<eos> No, not really.<eos> I don't see how it would affect us.<eos> Well, hopefully it won't.
- Patrick. What's wrong? What's wrong?<eos> Tell me, was he good?<eos> Did you keep something to remember him by?<eos> - What?<eos> - Brent.<eos> Did you keep something to remember him by?<eos> You know?<eos> Open it.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You will.
Will it go away?<eos> Do you still feel it?<eos> It can"t just go away.<eos> Well, it does.<eos> Not for me.<eos> It wasn"t different for me, and it won"t be for you.<eos> L"II change everything.<eos> You can"t change anything.<eos> - It"s done.<eos> - But I will.
L"II tell you how it was, and you"II do as I tell you.<eos> L"II do as I please, and you"II tell me how it was.<eos> L"m going to live another life.<eos> L"II do everything different from what you did.<eos> What"s going to happen to our kids?<eos> - I don"t have any kids.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> They haven"t been born yet, but that"s just a detail.<eos> You won"t abandon your kids before they"re born, will you?<eos> Yes, I will.
He"s my husband.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nicolau Sampaio.<eos> Did you marry Nicolau?<eos> Maria Helena"s ex-boyfriend.<eos> - L"II not marry Nicolau!<eos> - Yes, you will.<eos> I swear:<eos> Not even for a big mansion... with a pool and a tennis court, will I ever marry Nicolau.<eos> Yes, you will.
If thoughts can do that to water... imagine what our thoughts can do to us.<eos> Absolutely thought alone can completely change the body.<eos> Most people don't affect reality in a consistent, substantial way... because they don't believe they can.<eos> They write an intention... and then they erase it, because they think that's silly-<eos> I mean - I can't do that.<eos> And then they write it again, and then they erase it.<eos> So time average, it's a very small effect.<eos> And it really comes down to the fact that they believe they can't do it.<eos> If you accept with every rudiment of your being... that you will walk on water, will it happen?<eos> Yes, it will.
May I have that list?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Jesus, Emilio. Every day a new look.<eos> Where's the neck brace?<eos> Now it's "they hit me" makeup to et sympathy from Patricia.<eos> Or maybe your "little pal" beats you, and you like it.<eos> You've been askin for that for a long time and now your number's come up.<eos> He's worse today.<eos> He won't open up for anyone.<eos> He will for me.
It was a ritual.<eos> How come I never... saw that all that was hiding?<eos> Continue, continue.<eos> What was hidden behind these acts of love?<eos> What was hidden?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It was just a way...<eos> People's tastes change.<eos> Will you bring me jam in bed tomorrow morning?<eos> Of course I will.
It's a boy.<eos> Yegor?<eos> Who's this?<eos> Mom.<eos> How old are you?<eos> Twelve.<eos> Are you sure she's not coming back?<eos> Who?<eos> The vampire girl.<eos> She won't.
Joe's paid a cabinet maker in town to make him a chest.<eos> Told Gilson it had to be a strong one, with a lock on it.<eos> Hyrum Smith picked up the chest this morning.<eos> Well, then, Will, get the boys together.<eos> Tonight's the night.<eos> Lydia, what are you doing out?<eos> How did you know where l was?<eos> Someone at the dock said you were here.<eos> We need to talk, Joshua.<eos> We will, later.
Mother's sister runs a girl's school in Boston.<eos> They want me to go there and spend a year with her.<eos> A year?<eos> Mother says if I accept, she'll not stand in our way when I get back.<eos> You should go.<eos> I'll work while you're gone.<eos> A Mr. Knight, down by Pennsylvania, wants me to hire on.<eos> By next fall we could pay off our land free and clear.<eos> In twelve months you'll change.<eos> I won't.
No, just fetching some fabric.<eos> What did the Steed girl want?<eos> Steed?<eos> Oh, the wagon's leaving.<eos> I'll be back to cook supper.<eos> Evening, little brother.<eos> I understand you've been messing around in my personal life.<eos> See, I'm not going to be a dirt farmer like you and Pa, Nathan.<eos> I got plans. Lydia's part of those plans. Lydia doesn't want you.<eos> No, but she will.
I hope you enjoy it, considering the time you spend.<eos> I'm thinking of the future.<eos> Personally, I think I can live without a master's on André Breton's materialist transcendentalism.<eos> Live with your choice.<eos> I made no choice.<eos> The professor imposed it.<eos> I don't even know what it means.<eos> After two years, you don't what it means?<eos> No.<eos> And I never will.
Where is a chair?<eos> Chair?<eos> - You won't even answer me!<eos> Excuse me, I'm eeling like uKing<eos> Listen, give me the menu-card.<eos> - What?<eos> Just give me a late o biryani.<eos> make sure you give me the leg iece<eos> Everyone wants a leg iece.<eos> Where will I it rom?
All right.<eos> Yes, brother<eos> Is he studying in the same college?<eos> - Brother, I told you... there is no one.<eos> - I was only Kidding.<eos> Scared?<eos> Come on... come, let me make a lait<eos> One minute!<eos> I have something imortant to discuss with you... lease don't interrut me, okay?<eos> - I will.
Certainly<eos> I asked you will he come, and you say he will come<eos> Who is he?<eos> Who the hell is he?<eos> I any one o you is even a bit scared... get going<eos> Get lost<eos> That worthless slink barges in and oints a inger at me... and instead o wringing his neck, you say he's going to come<eos> Will he come?<eos> Will he come?<eos> - Yes, he will
- Anyone thirsty?<eos> Yeah, I wish I could stay, but I really have to get back to work.<eos> You're going?<eos> So soon?<eos> It was nice meeting you all.<eos> I hope things work out for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mom, can you please not do that anymore?<eos> I just want my boy to find love. Is that so terrible?<eos> I will.
Mr Duggal!<eos> - Yes, he has a vacant room<eos> Not just a room, his brains are empty too<eos> He used to be a police inspector in Goa... and has blood clotted in his head ever since a thief struck him with a stick<eos> Wherever the clot stands, that part becomes useless<eos> He plays deaf, dumb and blind<eos> Let's see what he's playing today<eos> He's playing blind today<eos> I don't believe this!<eos> - You will, very soon
we tried everything.<eos> radiation,bone marrow transplants... is he really cured?<eos> take him back to his doctor.<eos> run some tests.<eos> peter's leukemia is gone.<eos> this is a miracle.<eos> for now,it has to remain a private miracle.<eos> may i remind you that the confidentiality agreement you've signed is strictly binding.<eos> but people should know about that young man.<eos> and they will.
That's what you meant, yeah?<eos> - Would you step out of the car?<eos> You know, I have this same problem with my boy.<eos> Can never get him to say "please".<eos> I put it down to nerves.<eos> He forgets when he's nervous.<eos> Does that happen with you?<eos> Is this your vehicle?<eos> I prefer to think of it as an object of love.<eos> A love machine, if you will.
And I saw it go down with my own eyes.<eos> I've been investigating Morris for a few weeks now trying to figure out why so many of his suspects over the last five years just vanish or mysteriously wind up dead.<eos> Now I know.<eos> He takes the law into his own hands.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Well?<eos> - If she was lying, I couldn't sense it.<eos> Then how do you explain what happened?<eos> - Sure hope this works.<eos> - It will.
I'd offer you a drink, but I don't have any booze.<eos> Settle on a location for your new place yet?<eos> I'm looking.<eos> Good.<eos> - That's a lie.<eos> - Long as it's the only one you told me.<eos> I don't want Cy to back me, and I don't know how to do anything without him.<eos> I'll back you.<eos> You don't have that kind of money.<eos> - I will.
I don't want Cy to back me, and I don't know how to do anything without him.<eos> I'll back you.<eos> You don't have that kind of money.<eos> - I will.<eos> - You gonna turn prospector, Eddie?<eos> I'm gonna rob Cy.<eos> Don't, Eddie.<eos> He'll know.<eos> What's the time, kid?<eos> No, he won't.
They're staring 'cause they think you're hot.<eos> It's 9:30. What is your brother thinking?<eos> Want my advice?<eos> Call Dad. Go tell him to kick Andrew's ass.<eos> I am perfectly capable of handling this without your father.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Where's your cell phone?<eos> Call Andrewand find out wre he is.<eos> Mom, he's going to know you're behind this.<eos> No, he won't.
Don't move!<eos> Where do you want it?<eos> Oh... Fired.<eos> Whoa, three-way. That was hot.<eos> Congratulations, big-boned babe and choco-lickety-yum-yum. You're the final 2.<eos> Now all I needed was for foxxy to join us.<eos> Then we shall rise up against the cameras, Blow up the house, and kill them all!<eos> Announcer: when we return,<eos> Life for foxxy and the fatty is about to change once again, As we reveal the biggest twist yet.<eos> Or will we?
If you'll trust him.<eos> The emotions he stirred in me were powerful... and frightening.<eos> I tried to push him away.<eos> If Enterprise hadn't been stranded in the past, ... it's possible I never would've married Trip.<eos> But I can't imagine what my life would have been like without him.<eos> What do you suggest I do?<eos> There's a human expression.<eos> "Follow your heart."<eos> What if my "heart" doesn't know what it wants?<eos> It will, in time.

And the one thing that you all have in common is you think you can control it, but you can't.<eos> It owns you.<eos> Your eating disorder is going to be the fiercest opponent that you will ever face.<eos> You may never beat it.<eos> And the worst part is that not a single person in your life is telling you that right now.<eos> All they want for you to do is win at State, the whole town does.<eos> So I am going to be the one lone unpopular voice out there when you wrestle.<eos> I'm gonna root against you.<eos> I hope you lose.<eos> I won't.
I really don't need a lecture.<eos> I'm not lecturing.<eos> I'm just saying that maybe there's a reason you didn't telling me you were married.<eos> You didn't ask, how about that.<eos> You think every time a yokel sees his urologist he says,<eos> "By the way, Doctor, you should know I have a wife. " It's not a big deal.<eos> Look, I help a lot of people and I'm not knocking you.<eos> But truthfully and thankfully, you don't need it.<eos> You have a husband who loves you and wants to have a child with you.<eos> And we will.
Excuse me?<eos> When Amy misbehaved at school, you bought her a car.<eos> When she stayed out all night doing God knows what with that boy, you didn't tell me about it.<eos> Well, you're the one who wanted to put her on medication, what about that?<eos> She can now proudly answer "yes" for antidepressants on every medical history she fills out for the rest of her life.<eos> How dare you?<eos> How dare you pretend you gave even one minute of consideration to my opinion on that?<eos> You have never shown any respect for my authority as a parent.<eos> I can't even talk to you like this.<eos> Yes, you will.
- Is that so?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You're sure about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Because I really think I'm the one who-<eos> I don't want to buy you a beer, but you're clearly a nutter... and I think it might calm you down.<eos> Well, I don't want to drink with you either.<eos> You will.
- Yeah?<eos> You're sure about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Because I really think I'm the one who-<eos> I don't want to buy you a beer, but you're clearly a nutter... and I think it might calm you down.<eos> Well, I don't want to drink with you either.<eos> You will.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
Stepfather tried to pull Tandi out of the ambulance.<eos> Liv just did what she had to do to make sure we have a case.<eos> Well, Dad's telling the press you lied to him and deliberately ignored his wishes.<eos> His wishes? I thought we act for the victim, not her parents.<eos> Problem is, now he's threatening to withhold the rape kit.<eos> Why?<eos> He's upset, his daughter's traumatized.<eos> They just want this to go away.<eos> Okay. I'll talk to Tandi.<eos> No. No, Elliot will.
No problema. Abby, forensics may have missed something in '94.<eos> Go over it again.<eos> Yes, Professor.<eos> Come on, people.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Let's go! Hey, wait.<eos> Come here. You'll need Ducky's help.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> Abbs...<eos> Yes, I will.
- It's here on this opening night...<eos> - Nobody'll talk to me or even look at me.<eos> - Had a little bit to drink?<eos> - I'd like to show her how special she is.<eos> I gotta tell Marissa it wasn't just sex.<eos> I love her mom.<eos> Okay, I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Julie Cooper will you marry me?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Yes, of course I will, Cal.
- Thank you.<eos> - Wait, wait.<eos> I'm sorry, we're fresh out of flesh.<eos> I want to thank you all for coming this evening supporting this good cause.<eos> Now all these young men belong to the highest bidders till that midnight kiss.<eos> Let's try to keep things legal this year.<eos> I'll give $5 for the microphone boy.<eos> - I'll go 10.<eos> - Do I hear 20?<eos> I will. - $25.
You suck at it.<eos> Have fun?<eos> - No.<eos> It's just...<eos> It was a mistake and I'd like it to stay between us.<eos> I can keep a secret.<eos> - Promise?<eos> - You'll just have to trust me.<eos> I don't know you well enough to trust you.<eos> You will.
There you go, honey.<eos> There's plenty more if you want seconds.<eos> Deb, why don't you sit down and eat something?<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> Come on, ma, you need to keep up your strength too.<eos> Goddamn border guard, not letting you in.<eos> He was just following the law.<eos> Marriage doesn't exist.<eos> At least, not for us, not here.<eos> But it will.
Don't look.<eos> No... Would... would you sit down and shut up?<eos> You flatter me, my dear.<eos> By at least a couple inches.<eos> What about the rest of you?<eos> Doesn't look like me.<eos> That's what Gertrude Stein said to Picasso about her portrait.<eos> Know what he said?<eos> Hmm.<eos> "It will."
You was in the subway.<eos> You don't know how to give directions...<eos> - That's gonna be us in 30 years.<eos> - Please don't say that.<eos> I'm kidding, that could never be us.<eos> That already was us, remember?<eos> But that was then.<eos> So for the future, I don't want to become that.<eos> I don't want you to worry about becoming that.<eos> Okay, I won't.
I don't want to slack off like I used to.<eos> I don't want to be so moody.<eos> This is fun.<eos> I don't want to lose you again.<eos> Even if I screw up all the other stuff, that's the one that matters.<eos> I don't want to lose you either.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yes.<eos> Will you?
Yes, sorry, Lip. lt's been a bit of an off day today, hasn't it, Karen?<eos> So. Vodka, some tonic.<eos> Plenty of rum but we're out of blackcurrant.<eos> - And gin.<eos> - Just coffee, Mum.<eos> - (Tearfully) And a few lagers.<eos> - Lager would be great.<eos> Cheers.<eos> - What if your dad comes back?<eos> - He won't.
-Okay.<eos> All right, look.<eos> The Strike Team, that's your gig, okay?<eos> You and Vic, you established it, everyone knows that.<eos> I just wanna add what I can to the mix.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> But I don't wanna be along for the ride if I'm not wanted.<eos> I wasn't trying to be a dick.<eos> Me and Vic built this thing and I don't want somebody coming in and screwing it up.<eos> I won't.
And her uncle, the abbot, has him castrated.<eos> It's timeless, really.<eos> Even though he becomes a monk and she a nun, their passion burns on through these incredible letters through the rest of their lives.<eos> You, with these books.<eos> Education should never stop.<eos> It enriches all aspects of life.<eos> Hmm, I know.<eos> I wish someone could convince AJ of that.<eos> I keep thinking he could start over in college but who knows if he's even going to get the chance?<eos> He will.
I was able to boost the coverage by over 50% without much of a power increase. That should be enough for a sizeable population growth.<eos> Thank you. You have no idea how long the shield will last?<eos> There's no way of knowing, but there's a good chance you'll be a grandparent.<eos> We'd be happy to come back and check in on you.<eos> Ford could explain how to be a 25-year-old.<eos> - I'll look forward to it.<eos> - You'll have to get used to a few things.<eos> But we can talk about that next time we visit.<eos> - Just promise me you'll stick around.<eos> - I will.
You turned my life upside down.<eos> She wants to make amends.<eos> That's why I called.<eos> Sure, now that I know where to find her.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - You're sorry?<eos> - No, I really am.<eos> - Sorry doesn't cover it.<eos> Here.<eos> Maybe this will.
But you can ask him yourself. There he is.<eos> I tell you what. I think I'm going to go get you a refill instead.<eos> Tru.<eos> Hi, Ronny. God, it's been a while.<eos> Last time I saw you, it was right around prom time.<eos> I know it's about five years too late, but I owe you an apology.<eos> RONNY: I never meant to hurt you, Tru.<eos> Candace just got what she wanted.<eos> You know, she always did.<eos> -Always will.
No, lives were at stake.<eos> You did something good. But for reasons I may never understand, you felt like you couldn't come to me.<eos> - I was trying to protect you.<eos> - I didn't need you to protect me.<eos> I never did.<eos> What I needed was for you to let me in. To be a part of your life.<eos> But now... God, after this...<eos> Luc, please. It won't happen again.<eos> It will.<eos> Maybe not the same way, but it will.
NATO doesn't seem to want to pitch in troops to the peacekeeping mission.<eos> The President asked for NATO troups largely as a courtesy.<eos> What we really need from our allies is financial support, logistical support, tactical aid, all of which they've enthusiastically pledged.<eos> We don't need their troops?<eos> The President doesn't want to present the impression that we're strong arming the region with an onslaught of European forces marching into Jerusalem under an American flag.<eos> This is a process that will be executed by the Palestinian and Israeli governments.<eos> We're just there to help out.<eos> What if it turns out to be a bigger job?<eos> The President knows actly what he's getting into, and he crafted a mission he knew could succeed.<eos> And it will.
- Roe v. Wade affords me the right to terminate a pregnancy.<eos> And to do so free from all restraint or interference of others.<eos> - A hearing room...<eos> - I'm told I have a right to privacy.<eos> I think this would be the sort of thing it's referring to.<eos> I also bet like a drunken sailor during my bimonthly games of hearts.<eos> Do you wanna talk about that?<eos> - An abortion?<eos> - Maybe they won't find it.<eos> - They will.
You think he's gonna call?<eos> No, he's done with her.<eos> All this guy really cares about are the diamonds.<eos> Well, if he wants diamonds, let's give him diamonds.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> We want you to call Lance.<eos> Tell him that you made a terrible mistake.<eos> You tell him that it was the wrong boat.<eos> - He'll never believe me.<eos> - Yes, he will.
- Well, I think that's impressive.<eos> It's only actually four words and a digit.<eos> My siblings got 5 1, collectively.<eos> - Digits?<eos> - Words.<eos> I didn't know your brother was on a scholarship.<eos> Uh, you weren't though, were you?<eos> What if I only ever rate four words and a digit?<eos> What if by the time my mother's next book comes out, the sentence hasn't changed?<eos> It will.
Would you like a sandwich?<eos> Got bitten by a scorpion in the jungle, when he was asleep.<eos> I had to suck the poison out of his thigh.<eos> - There's ham.<eos> - The sweet, sweaty smell of his flesh...<eos> Or tongue.<eos> I think I'll go for the ham.<eos> Don't tell anyone, Steel, please.<eos> Promise you won't tell anyone?<eos> - I won't.
- We don't need you!<eos> We need nothing!<eos> If that's true, then I've made a mistake, and you should kill me now.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Peace.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Morpheus!<eos> And if you fail?<eos> I won't.
You're wrong.<eos> It's a Captain Amazing compass.<eos> - How much you want for it?<eos> - It's not for sale.<eos> No way. Sorry.<eos> - Wanna play some ball? - No.<eos> You play ball.<eos> I gotta check this entire beach if I'm gonna make my car payment.<eos> - You've got a car?<eos> - No, but I will.
Free will.<eos> My opponent says that Mr Stone came to her because what he had was not enough, that he wanted more.<eos> More what? More money?<eos> More sex? More power? More control?<eos> That's what she'd have you believe.<eos> But when Mr Stone came to her, or rather when she came to Mr Stone, what my client really wanted was readers.<eos> He wanted people to read what he wrote.<eos> He's a writer.<eos> That's what writers want.<eos> An audience. An audience for his words, for his vision. For his truth, if you will.
You must remain unseen.<eos> And if you are seen, you must blend in with the people around you.<eos> How?<eos> You know many languages from the different men you knew in the camp.<eos> Just listen closely and you'll be able to speak to people and understand them.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> There are places where the world is good.<eos> I've seen them.<eos> A long time ago, but I have seen them.<eos> You will, too.
How... How would he even find the money to buy me out of my half?<eos> Oh...<eos> Oh.<eos> Wow.<eos> Apparently she likes the place.<eos> It's near the right schools.<eos> Schools.<eos> She's...<eos> You're gonna get over this.<eos> You will, Frances.
It's like something Mom would say. Yeah.<eos> And I'm starting to realize Mom and Dad's idea of appropriate behavior might be a little bit different than mine.<eos> Mish, you're in love.<eos> You're getting married. I mean, what's this like?<eos> It's like it's... I'm never going to be able to explain it.<eos> I wanted us to write our own vows for the wedding and now I can't do mine.<eos> How do you explain love?<eos> I guess I wouldn't know.<eos> I don't think I've ever felt that way about a guy.<eos> Someday you will.
Ulrik, want to be completely honest with you.<eos> If it weren't for Benedikte, never would have re-hired you.<eos> What you did to the firm and the family was unforgivable.<eos> But Benedikte has chosen to be loyal to you and respect that.<eos> I'm hiring you as the human resources manager.<eos> Your office will be up here, even though position doesn't warrant it.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> You won't regret.<eos> promise.<eos> - You won't. - Good.
- From now on, he's my new brother.<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> Sorry, you've been replaced with my dear brother...<eos> What's your name again?<eos> I don't want any more brothers.<eos> - See?<eos> He's had enough of you, too.<eos> - I promise I'll change.<eos> Trample off.<eos> You won't.
I reacted the way I did because I saw my brother naked.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> - Hey, you just got here.<eos> - Did I?<eos> Time flies when you're mortified.<eos> - You make a beautiful couple.<eos> - Did you hear that?<eos> - Mortified.<eos> - She'll get over it.<eos> Yeah, but will I?
Did you get it?<eos> Did you get it?<eos> Don't say I never did anything for you.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Don't worry. He's busy.<eos> Sorry it took me so long, man.<eos> I was lookin' for something bigger.<eos> Oh, hey... I'm sorry.<eos> Even if they put it back on... it's not gonna work the same.<eos> Sure, it will.
The life I lead today..<eos> Is indebted to you in every breath<eos> Arpita, even in a hundred births, I'll not be able.. To repay their debt<eos> Enough, son.. enough<eos> No father. I know nothing else<eos> You can't leave me and go away<eos> I'm not leaving you, my son. It's only for a few days<eos> All right, father. I'll not turn down anything you say<eos> But you'll have to listen to something I've to say<eos> You'll, won't you?
She found your boat, Spike.<eos> They can use it to patch the Comvee.<eos> I'll get it!<eos> Spike, no!<eos> The waves are too big!<eos> Hey, this is Spike you're talking to.<eos> I've paddled my way to more tennis balls than I can count!<eos> If I could count.<eos> But I'm afraid you won't make it!<eos> Sure I will!
I implore you.<eos> Leave me alone! Get away from me!<eos> She doesn't remember.<eos> It can't be her.<eos> It is her, sir.<eos> The gypsy woman prophesied her return.<eos> And now the time has come.<eos> You had best get ready.<eos> But she doesn't remember.<eos> In time she will , sir.
Get out, please.<eos> Get out!<eos> Let them fuckin' talk!<eos> - Let them discuss this.<eos> - You get out too.<eos> Fuck, give 'em time to talk.<eos> You're here, so we're here too.<eos> Give us a break.<eos> Will you get out?<eos> You won't?
How much is in the pot?<eos> Stop fucking around and play.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's 800... and I'll raise you 2000.<eos> You're raising 2000 on top of the 800? - Yep.<eos> What a man!<eos> He's either got balls made of marble or a full house.<eos> Even with a full house, you need balls.<eos> Put in 2000 if you wanna play.<eos> I will.
I've been thinking about that<eos> I was thinking maybe like a veterinarian, you know Cos I fucking love animals, you know<eos> But that's a doctor...<eos> you gotta get a degree for that<eos> No, I'm not, no<eos> Shit, I know, you know what I always wanted to be?<eos> What?<eos> President of the US<eos> I just haven't been feeling too good lately, you know<eos> But I will though, man
- I just wanna go home.<eos> - Now you listen to me.<eos> There is no place in this part of the county... to waste your time cying overwants.<eos> Your life's about needs now.<eos> You need a roof overyour head for the winter.<eos> That's what you bargained for.<eos> We are here today, gathered in the Lord's name... to join this man and this woman in marriage.<eos> Please join hands.<eos> Will you, Clark Davis, take Marty Claridge to be your lawful wedded wife?<eos> I will.

You fucking dickhead!<eos> You know what dying means?<eos> -Asshole!<eos> -You're the asshole.<eos> -Fuck off!<eos> -Fuck...!<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Come on back to the clinic.<eos> You don't want to do this again?<eos> Fine, we won't.
-1 ,600!<eos> 1 ,600 going once, says the doctor, 1 ,600...<eos> -2,000.<eos> -Adriana, 2,000.<eos> -2,500. -2,500, little Sara.<eos> -2,800.<eos> -2,800, says Orlandino.<eos> Who'll give you the money?<eos> Me? -Daddy will.<eos> -Mommy will.
This is a gift from him.<eos> -Come and visit me.<eos> -Of course I will.<eos> I'll come and visit every once and a while.<eos> Come on, smile!<eos> This is a big day.<eos> Aren't you happy?<eos> Go on.<eos> -Come with me.<eos> -No, I won't.
How could I tell my nephew to do such a thing?<eos> What's her name?<eos> -Ermione.<eos> -Ermione?<eos> Jump her bones.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I know you couldn't.<eos> -Let go.<eos> -No, I won't!
Mr. Singhaniya called to say that soon he will get Raj and Jiya engaged.<eos> That's great news.<eos> "Know what, Kiran?<eos> Jiya is" our Kajal's sister-in-law.<eos> How does such a big world become so small sometimes?<eos> What medicine are you giving her?<eos> - She needs sleep badly.<eos> "And without these pills," she doesn't sleep a wink.<eos> Why won't she sleep?<eos> She will now.
These two entities are, let's say, two.<eos> But principally, we all live in one country.<eos> What's he babbling about?<eos> - Let him talk.<eos> You all see this red line?<eos> You see it or not?<eos> - We see it!<eos> This that you see, exists no more.<eos> Death used to flow along this line, and now, we'll sow - life!<eos> Sure we will!
What brings you here?<eos> - I came back. - For good?<eos> Good. Where are you going?<eos> - In the town hall, to register.<eos> I'll give you a lift.<eos> Hello, Zaim.<eos> If there wasn't for me, would you ever become a chief?<eos> - No.<eos> Have I ever asked you a favour? - You haven't.<eos> Now I will.
Not a tidal wave!<eos> There are no tidal waves in Brazil.<eos> If I could pay just the interest, he'd be happy.<eos> Don't look at me!<eos> You've got money socked away.<eos> I give you room and board.<eos> But it's only a loan.<eos> You never pay me back.<eos> This time I'll pay.<eos> I will!

Come on.<eos> To the devil with false modesty.<eos> The devil!<eos> Billy!<eos> Shh!<eos> Will you close that a little bit?<eos> Jesus, you wanna get caught?<eos> - That Carrie White, she sure is cute.<eos> - Thought you said they were gonna win.<eos> - They will.
Too cold!<eos> You'll end up an alcoholic if you keep drinking like this<eos> I am Okay, okay<eos> You seem worried<eos> No<eos> Why would I be worried when I have such a pretty daughter?<eos> My Mina... Will you live well without me?<eos> Why?<eos> Do you want to marry again?<eos> Will you?
Don't get too close.<eos> You'll set off the alarm.<eos> And I don't think the local army commandant... will appreciate being dragged here from his bed at this time of night.<eos> -The army?<eos> -Oh, yes.<eos> Far more reliable than the island's police.<eos> One of the benefits of having friends in high places.<eos> That's some pearl, Mr. Duval.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Yes, and you never will.
- I'm not so sure.<eos> - If you're not so sure, then turn me in.<eos> I don't wanna turn you in, Jack.<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> You don't have to be.<eos> I've kicked it.<eos> I have a responsibility to stop this virus.<eos> And I am taking a calculated risk... that you are more of an asset than a liability.<eos> Just please don't screw this up.<eos> I won't.
Giving her access to Echelon could only help that.<eos> In this instance, I think she could be an asset.<eos> They found it. Quicksand.<eos> I told your father my terms.<eos> Full access to the network. No restrictions.<eos> Dad fought for you on this.<eos> Don't make him regret it.<eos> I'll need to send an access code.<eos> How will we know you're not signaling your organization?<eos> You won't.
We lost the signal. Sloane may have found the wire.<eos> The CIA's been listening.<eos> They're here.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> All I need to know right now is whether you want to come with me.<eos> Come with you?<eos> If you don't want to, I'll understand. But, Emily, please. Please.<eos> Now.<eos> Yes. I will.
See if anyone knows anything.<eos> - I'm your demon.<eos> ANGEL: Fred, Wesley.<eos> If there's experts on mystical births, we're it.<eos> We'll pull the files on Darla and her pregnancy, see what we can find.<eos> Gunn, I want you to sit tight for now.<eos> Never hurts to have muscle on deck.<eos> In the meantime, has to be a reason why the Beastmaster wanted Angelus.<eos> I'll piece together what I know. Things he said when he was in my head, everything.<eos> - Maybe something will...
- Let's go.<eos> - I can't go to jail.<eos> - Let's just watch cartoons.<eos> - Sir, we will not be starting with Les Cousins...<eos> - until you leave.<eos> - Excuse me, but I thought my A.A.R.P. card...<eos> - was good for one and a guest.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I knew society would never accept this.<eos> And they never will.
Okay.<eos> It's so weird.<eos> What's weird?<eos> I remember him shooting me once.<eos> But I was hit twice.<eos> Well, you know what happens sometimes, trauma can affect our perception of the situation, and the bad guys come to count on that.<eos> That means he's going to get away?<eos> What it means, Ricky, is that he doesn't understand how evidence works.<eos> But you know what?<eos> He will.
As he spoke to Abraham, and Isaiah, and Moses.<eos> Thank you for coming, Norman.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Has it been that long?<eos> Has it been that long?<eos> Why Samson, what a lovely surprise!<eos> Good morning, Miss Jolene.<eos> I thought these might brighten your day.<eos> Why you sweet, darlin' man!<eos> They most surely will!
Will you drop me off on the way to Richard's?<eos> - I would love to.<eos> - Paige, Phoebe, listen to me.<eos> Wait.<eos> What do I tell them?<eos> Don't tell them anything.<eos> Just stick to your cover story.<eos> The less they know about the future, the better.<eos> - What if they find out who I really am?<eos> - They won't.
You know you want to.<eos> - What happened?<eos> Where did he go?<eos> - Nowhere.<eos> He was right here all along.<eos> I was dreaming about you.<eos> About us.<eos> The way we used to be.<eos> And I don't want that to change just because we're married and having a baby.<eos> It won't.
All right, I give up.<eos> Hey, big guy, you want to do the popcorn machine?<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> Pop, pop, pop, pop...<eos> Yeah, see, now he smiles.<eos> Okay, let's get you ready for the fair, okay?<eos> I'm telling you, it's not gonna fit.<eos> Nothing fits anymore.<eos> If he keeps growing at this rate, we're gonna have to send him to college by next week.<eos> Well, he will in these.
Look.<eos> I need you.<eos> Dawson needs you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's the most crucial thing you need to get through that head of yours.<eos> Things will never be the same between Dawson and me.<eos> Or any of us, for that matter.<eos> You're gonna have to accept that.<eos> I don't.<eos> And I never will.
That sounds about right, except the part about me directing a big movie.<eos> You'll get there, Dawson.<eos> I have a feeling about you.<eos> Which makes me wonder if I was wrong about us.<eos> Because the other day, watching you take control of the movie I don't think I've ever been so proud of anyone in my life.<eos> Then again, I could have been turned on by your vulgar display of authority.<eos> It's been lovely.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Oh, and just so you know, there will be other actresses. But I was the first, and don't you forget it.<eos> Oh, I won't.
Adam's gonna be all right.<eos> He's responding well.<eos> I should never have filed for custody.<eos> I should've grabbed these kids and run away somewhere.<eos> She wants to see Henry.<eos> Look, Mr. Martin, I know this is a very difficult time and you're angry but she's going to die and you need to think about what's best in the long run.<eos> She wants him to see her like that?<eos> She wants to say goodbye.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
He doesn't need you to feed him answers.<eos> - What did he tell you?<eos> - He didn't have to.<eos> The Grover story was a little specific not to mention straight off the Ferris wheel.<eos> You might think I've forgotten the time we've spent together but I haven't.<eos> - Did you tell him anything else?<eos> - No.<eos> Just Grover.<eos> - Look does Colin know that you...?<eos> - No. No and he won't.
Oh, great, I'm glad you got that.<eos> It's been bugging me for the last...<eos> - Is this the off-white or the cream?<eos> - The off-white.<eos> The cream is more creamy.<eos> I cut those myself so they could be adjusted either way.<eos> I mean, they could be adjusted smaller.<eos> Taller would be tougher once they're cut, but, if they tell a lie, they'll shoot right back up.<eos> - I assume you'll have servers.<eos> - Yes, we will.
We haven't spoken in months.<eos> Still, you're his mother.<eos> Nobody knows him better than you.<eos> I'll never stop loving my son.<eos> But he destroyed Lee's life.<eos> He should be in jail.<eos> Mrs. Baxter, does your son know that you're sick?<eos> I haven't told him.<eos> You understand that if he contacts you, you need to report it? I know.<eos> I will.
Who did?<eos> She did.<eos> Who's she?<eos> I can't tell!<eos> Why can't you tell?<eos> Because I promised!<eos> Who did you promise?<eos> It's okay, Robert.<eos> You had to tell. Christina will understand.<eos> No, she won't.
I can't let go of what that little girl went through.<eos> I was watching you for this job when you were in white collar.<eos> Knew you were tough, but wasn't sure you were the right person.<eos> I'm not.<eos> The fact that it effects you like this tells me my first instincts were right.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This case was the ultimate test.<eos> And you passed with flying colors.<eos> But I don't want it.<eos> You will.
Internal bleeding from a perforated bowel caused by the presence of hard objects in his intestines. / Hard objects, what the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> Look... I have been a damn good NCIS agent for over six years now.<eos> I really don't deserve to be treated like this.<eos> All we asked is, can we open these letters?<eos> Sure, go ahead.<eos> Open the damn things.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They're to my family.<eos> Would you like to... search my apartment while you're at it?<eos> / I will.
Let my office know if that time works for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And don't let them bump my time.<eos> I want to be the first one in the morning.<eos> Mrs. Grubman.<eos> Dr. Troy, don't worry.<eos> I'm not here to rekindle any of that ugly lawsuit business.<eos> I just came to schedule some light bottom lipo.<eos> I didn't approve that operation.<eos> Oh, but you will.
Ben, I need this.<eos> I've only got one marker to use with the chief.<eos> If it use it, I need results.<eos> I need them quick...<eos> - or we're both out of a job.<eos> - Just give me the chance.<eos> The unit's anti-gang, anti-drug.<eos> - Your own team, wow.<eos> - I just can't blow it.<eos> - You won't.
But I'd like to put a backup plan in place.<eos> Fill the last open slot with a guy who could... run the Strike Team if Mackey flunked out.<eos> Give the man a chance, David.<eos> It's day one.<eos> I've read his file, called around.<eos> A lot of people won't work with him.<eos> It's a crucial slot. We can do better.<eos> I need this experiment to be successful. - So do you.<eos> - Then we need someone who can deliver.<eos> He will.
- It's awful.<eos> I'm gonna have to go on the attack now.<eos> Find a way to turn this into votes.<eos> Baby, what's wrong?<eos> - I don't know how I got here.<eos> - Hard work.<eos> Intelligence.<eos> - That's not what I meant.<eos> - You'll catch whoever's doing this.<eos> - Or Mackey will.
- They want light... - Unh.<eos> ...by God, they'll get light.<eos> No!<eos> End of the line.<eos> Hey, you're not John Ritter.<eos> And you ain't that gorilla from the zoo.<eos> Okay, you filthy booze-bags, it's 2 a.m. So, uh, who's the designated driver?<eos> It was Andy.<eos> No one's ever won Moe's drink-a-gallon-of-gin challenge.<eos> And no one ever will.
I am dead.<eos> What do you think?<eos> There is a possibility that we are being penetrated by a dangerous double agent, working for God knows whom - the Algerian secret service?<eos> The Pakistani intelligence service?<eos> An Al Qaeda offshoot?<eos> - Could be a disaster for us.<eos> - Or he's telling the truth.<eos> Offering his services to a country with which he has fallen in love.<eos> That's what we want to believe.<eos> Then, we will.
But do you know how much she loves you, and would appreciate a call once in a while?<eos> Hi, Alan. Shower open? - Yeah.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> - Hi, Alan.<eos> Judith?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Cindy's teaching me to surf. She says I'm a natural.<eos> 'Cause she's got the upper body strength for it.<eos> Nothing like yours.<eos> You will.
# We have to choose to win or lose #<eos> And I guess I win.<eos> Open the door!<eos> That's a great voice, Geoffrey.<eos> Your confession.<eos> My first instinct was to kill you but that was letting you off too easy.<eos> I needed it to last...<eos> His confession.<eos> That'll never stand up in court.<eos> It will, Geoffrey.
TRISH: I was surprised at how quickly we all worked together.<eos> I mean we didn't know who we were, what your name was yet.<eos> And, um, within a matter of probably ten minutes, we all sort of spread out and it worked out pretty well.<eos> One of the first items on our to-do list when we got here was build a shelter.<eos> And we did that.<eos> Actually, it looked pretty good.<eos> Yay!<eos> You know what?<eos> We need a little bit bigger firewood.<eos> Bigger firewood? We will pretty soon.
Erotic.<eos> I feel erotic too.<eos> And since we already established I can do things twice your speed, I'm going to go behind that screen and re-emerge in a sexy nightie in a time that takes for you to snap your fingers.<eos> Did you just say sexy nightie?<eos> I did and with pride.<eos> There haven't been sexy nighties since 1974.<eos> Yep.<eos> Well, one survived and I own it. It's probably worth a fortune.<eos> I love you.<eos> Not as much as you will in a minute.
"Who will cry for the little boy? "Who walked the burning sand.<eos> "Who will cry for the little boy?<eos> "The boy inside the man.<eos> "Who will cry for the little boy? "Who knew well hurt and pain.<eos> "Who will cry for the little boy? "Who died and died again.<eos> "Who will cry for the little boy?<eos> "A good boy he tried to be.<eos> "Who will cry for the little boy? Who cries inside of me?"<eos> Who will cry for the little boy, Antwone?<eos> I will.
Or spoken with him? He's ugly and miserable!<eos> - But my child, if the First Consul is asking for you to marry him--<eos> - The First Consul should look after the affairs of state and leave me alone!<eos> And what's more, he should look after you.<eos> - But he loves me, as much as he loved me the first day we've met.<eos> - Then let's hope that what everyone is waiting for will finally happen.<eos> - And what do you mean by that?<eos> - You know very well.<eos> People are surprised you haven't born him a child. - Oh.<eos> But I will, soon.
How many people in this building you think... are looking at your naked girlfriend right now?<eos> She's got a good body, though.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Were you ever with her?<eos> Who, Annie?<eos> Nobody could get near her.<eos> Look, Bob, she's your girl.<eos> Do what you want with her.<eos> Just be careful.<eos> I will.
You can always get it.<eos> Don't say you forgot.<eos> It's not true.<eos> I can't get any more.<eos> Not just now.<eos> - But it hurts.<eos> - I know.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You never will.
- It's only good advice if you take it.<eos> - Qué pasa? - Up ahead. Roadbiock.<eos> - Who are they looking for?<eos> - Anyone not like them.<eos> His passport was found in his backpack when he escaped one of our roadblocks.<eos> - He's committing suicide.<eos> - Oniy two ways he can go:<eos> Upriver or on the road through Mompós.<eos> If we know he's here, the guerrillas know.<eos> Or they will soon.
- What would you have me do?<eos> - Heip me stop him.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I'm trusting you with my life.<eos> And my son's.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Ciaudio went to Washington to plant a bomb.<eos> I can't be a part of it anymore.<eos> They'll protect us, won't they?<eos> If they won't, I will.
Do you know our high school reunion's coming up?<eos> Ten years.<eos> Do you know how depressing that is?<eos> Do you think I don't wanna, fuckin', slash my... wrists when I think about that?<eos> Goddamit!<eos> It's, like, you finish high school, and then what?<eos> I'm supposed to be in New York City, selling out CBGB's.<eos> What the fuck are we still doing here?<eos> I just wanna make something happen with my music, you know?<eos> You will.
- It will be, it will...<eos> Hold him!<eos> Pleas leave him!<eos> "Pleas leave him!" You think that will help?<eos> My son is hungry!<eos> Can you hear him crying?<eos> You don't know what's like to be a mother!<eos> I'm the mother of two children that should be fed! Understand? !<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> And you never will.
-Because of the lie you told!<eos> How do you know that I told a lie?<eos> Because lies, dear Pinocchio, are of two types:<eos> Those that have short legs and those that have a long nose!<eos> And mine, what type are they?<eos> But, dear Fairy!<eos> Dear Fairy, do you see what a nose I have?<eos> It's become so long, so very long!<eos> Everyone will laugh at me!<eos> They will!
Let's check it again.<eos> Mom, I did it.<eos> We got to stay calm, okay?<eos> If we stay calm, everything will be fine.<eos> All right?<eos> Stay calm.<eos> You're making me nervous.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What if I keep dropping?<eos> You won't.
You want to turn off your light?<eos> You're pretty damn calm about it.<eos> I heard from Sister.<eos> She accepted the $1 2,000 I offered.<eos> When I come back from Rose Red with hard data, there'll be four dozen universities willing to hire me.<eos> First, I'm going to write a book.<eos> It is going to sell a gazillion copies.<eos> I once heard you say that the only certainty when dealing with the paranormal is that nothing is certain.<eos> What if you spend three days in Rose Red and nothing happens?<eos> But it will.
What?<eos> Yeah!"Oh, Ricky, you can have me, Any time you want me!"<eos> Rick is off limits!<eos> You do not talk to him, You do not call him Or ever see him again !<eos> Otherwise I'll be all off you like a fly... Anywhere you want...<eos> - genetic lab. - Is Max there?<eos> Yeah,we were heading off to lunch .<eos> - Just you and him? - Yeah<eos> You sound awfully familiar.Do I know you?<eos> You will, Bitch!
Your brother's getting...<eos> You slave weekends, for them!<eos> I work on films. For Tourneur, Clouzot and myself. To learn.<eos> And I'm always learning.<eos> Then shoot.<eos> Direct your first film.<eos> Not now.<eos> Not until we've kicked them out.<eos> And I haven't signed a contract.<eos> I never will.
It's her loss, Luce.<eos> It's weird though, you know?<eos> .<eos> I don't have a mother.<eos> Well, you have us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Trying to call your dad?<eos> .<eos> I can't.<eos> I will in a minute.
Let it go.<eos> Where do you think you're going with this?<eos> We'll go to the police. We'll tell 'em what we saw.<eos> - What you think you saw.<eos> - What I saw.<eos> If you were in the attic with me you can corroborate that she was at the Tomb.<eos> - If I'm wrong and Diana's fine, then there's no harm done.<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> - What if the Skulls find out we went to the police?<eos> - They won't.
You've always said that.<eos> I always said you were a scheming bitch.<eos> Listen Shane, I'm not going anywhere. So, we might as well get along, unless you want to be next.<eos> Next of what?<eos> Lookin' forward to gettin' back to work.<eos> It'll be like the old days, knockin' off Angie's big shop for a bag of lollies.<eos> And we won't have to share it with Frank anymore.<eos> Will we, mate?<eos> Have you got my table six?<eos> No, we won't. Will we?
You got me wrong, pig.<eos> I never saw your diamonds.<eos> Don't fuck with me.<eos> Seven dead! Nobody kills 7 guys for an ounce of hash or a bag of flour.<eos> You knew what was in that safe.<eos> You went for it!<eos> If I talk, I'm dead.<eos> I'll never get to court.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The rocks won't either.
By the way, do you have my panties?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - My panties.<eos> I may have left them in your car.<eos> Let me do it.<eos> It's acting funny.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You got to bring your times down.<eos> I'm not seeing Olympic swimming.<eos> And neither will Stanford.
Don't be alarmed. I'll let you stay here... on my land if you prove cooperative.<eos> Cooperative?<eos> I want you to take me to the spring.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Don't insult me, Mr. Tuck.<eos> It's immediately clear to me that the water's powers have been wasted on... unimaginative people like you.<eos> I intend to make this fountain of youth, as the simpletons would call it available to those who deserve it... for a price, of course.<eos> You'll die of old age before I'll take you.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Then, perhaps Winifred will!
Girls, as much as I'd love to help you, I--<eos> To be short, Mrs. Murphy, we're not here to sell you anything.<eos> I was thinking... those two boys seem so idle... and it occurred to me that they aren't bad after all, at least in years.<eos> Do you suppose they would make a likely pair of assistants?<eos> You'll both make equal commissions for the subscriptions you sell... which we will pay you at the end of every day.<eos> You can save your money for college.<eos> That is, if you want to go to college... because neither one of you have got the brains to win a scholarship.<eos> - Not even a football scholarship.<eos> - I'll get a football scholarship.<eos> Yeah, he will.
Unfortunately, man is worse than any figment of our imagination.<eos> - You're good.<eos> - I am, aren't I?<eos> I give these things dozens of times a year.<eos> Now I am just tired.<eos> I'm tired of... Tired of pretending.<eos> Everything is...<eos> Everything is under control.<eos> Until the next atrocity comes along.<eos> And it will.
She's in another clinic, they don't know where. I don't believe that.<eos> Neither do I, but I'm not surprised they won't tell us.<eos> Hey man, are you still my friend?<eos> Of course, whom do you think I'm here for?<eos> Then find out what's happened to Alicia.<eos> If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive... I need to know.<eos> You understand, don't you?<eos> Yes. I'll try to find out.<eos> See you Saturday.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
- Good liqueur, huh?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Aren't you hungry?<eos> I made a Bresse chicken.<eos> Sounds good?<eos> Want the drumstick?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'm full.<eos> - No, really, I can't.<eos> - No takers? Then I will.
Like the Common joint? Mm-hmm. That's it.<eos> The classic Common joint, which, actually, we should play right now, since we're talkin' about that.<eos> It's a perfect opportunity to do that. Let's do this.<eos> It's my joint right here, too. I love it.<eos> Um, you want to dedicate it to anybody?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um... I would, uh, like to dedicate this song, like I dedicated my book, to hip-hop.<eos> I used to love you.<eos> I still do.<eos> And always will.
Do you remember anything about that night?<eos> That night with Katie?<eos> Do you remember... How she died?<eos> She told you about a videotape, didn't she?<eos> She was afraid, wasn't she?<eos> Something was happening to her.<eos> How did she die?<eos> Please.<eos> I need to know.<eos> And you will.
It's the Golden Goose!<eos> - I've no money at present. Where are you going?<eos> don't do that!<eos> Don't be foolish! I've got a property in Prague!<eos> The porter wouldn't stir from him.<eos> He stood over him like his shadow.<eos> Then he accompanied him to Goat Place where the headquarters of the lottery were.<eos> I'll be damned!<eos> I've never seen the like!<eos> and you never will again!
-Tell me when the meeting's set.<eos> -Where's the copy machine?<eos> Right over there.<eos> "Sending her signals".<eos> Now I see the signals you're sending.<eos> Of course they're signals. They're subtle, that's all.<eos> Sure, like buying a place together.<eos> You can't fool me.<eos> -You won't leave her.<eos> -Yes I will.
Animals have to know where the water is out here.<eos> Then we follow them to the water, and we just drink our faces up.<eos> Or else they go to the mating grounds, you know, and... And then they mate, and they get thirsty, and they come back.<eos> All right, but, I mean, I...<eos> We don't know how far the water is, though.<eos> And I don't think we should abandon the higher-ground idea, 'cause it was a good idea.<eos> And that was a rolling hills scout-about. And if we go on a mountain, like, crow's-nesting, like that mountain over there...<eos> Yeah, but... We know where the water is now. We could just go there, and then get water and then go on our mountain, the mountaintop scout-about, after we've gotten water.<eos> I think the mountain's a better idea because what if we go to the mating grounds and they see us and they get self-conscious, and then they don't mate?<eos> Then we'll just...
Daddy...<eos> I'm a lenience man.<eos> I'm willing to forget the considerable damage and rudeness you and your husband have inflicted on my company.<eos> However, that depends on you telling me what the secret of the Thirds is.<eos> Daddy !<eos> The secret of your ability to conceive life.<eos> My secret ?<eos> You really want to know ?<eos> Shall I show it to you right now ?<eos> You really will ?
They weren't kidding about you.<eos> I can't take credit for this.<eos> So where's our mysterious killer?<eos> - She's not a killer.<eos> - Then what is she?<eos> A mother.<eos> Okay, then where is she?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Take care of your family.<eos> I will.
Cool, cool.<eos> Cool.<eos> But I have to wear my sneakers.<eos> Right. But the sneakers, they're not proper attire for brunch at the Boyïs.<eos> You want to make your best possible impression.<eos> So put on these shoes look good, and maybe you'll get adopted.<eos> Go on.<eos> All right, Murph.<eos> Guard these with your life, all right?<eos> I will.
I'm dying in here.<eos> And you let this happen?<eos> Your own mother?<eos> You'll come in here and then you see me lying dead on the bed.<eos> Do you want that?<eos> - Mom! You can say, what you want, I do not hear back at all.<eos> You said yourself, that it come then.<eos> Do not you come out!<eos> You stay in there until you're feeling better.<eos> - I will not!
Aye, it will.<eos> -How was your journey, my pet?<eos> -Dreadful.<eos> -Was it perishing?<eos> -Torture.<eos> What?<eos> Have you....<eos> Did anybody....<eos> Has nothing been heard... about me?<eos> Not a word, and never will we.
- What'll I do?<eos> - I'll find it.<eos> St. Christopher... What will I do ?<eos> She's not well!<eos> She's not...<eos> What?<eos> Crispina?<eos> Crispina, what are you doing?<eos> - You'll never find St. Christopher.<eos> - I will!
Just do it!<eos> You're doing it.<eos> Little pigs, little pigs, let me in.<eos> Not by the hair on your chinny chinny chin.<eos> Then I'll huff and I'll puff... and I'll bash your brains in.<eos> Hinty's gonna drop a hot stack when he sees this.<eos> I should have known it would be red.<eos> It's pink, Mama.<eos> I can see your dirty pillows.<eos> Everyone will.
I was that small when I first came, and now...<eos> You can be sure I won't tell anyone...<eos> Goodbye!<eos> How's he?<eos> Everything's good...<eos> Bon appetit mum, bon appetit dad.<eos> I have to see him, you can't stop me...<eos> Mum, don't, I'll do it myself<eos> Why don't you understand, it's my poor son...<eos> Sure, you will...
- You're gonna change my locks, ha?<eos> What is it?<eos> What the fuck are you staring at?<eos> What's the problem with you? Hear that?<eos> Hear what she's saying?<eos> And I wonder why the kid doesn't want my Daniel.<eos> Of course she doesn't, when she licks her roommate's cunt!<eos> You know what, no normal woman would ever touch your Daniel!<eos> You, whore, you won't talk like that about my son!<eos> Yes I will, about our impotent moronic so.
No, but maybe you could take me with you instead.<eos> Damn, you do start fast, don`t you?<eos> l`d really like to go with you now.<eos> And exactly why is that?<eos> I need to show you something.<eos> Slow down.<eos> -Girl, don`t hit the gas like that!<eos> -You don`t understand.<eos> You really need to see this.<eos> I will.
-Hey, I know Estape.<eos> -Yeah? -Yeah.<eos> He supervised my final thesis... -and we became friends.<eos> -You're friends?<eos> Sometimes we have dinner when he's in Madrid.<eos> He likes hearing gossip about the bank.<eos> I heard he's coming to Madrid next week for a lecture.<eos> Yeah, he mentioned that.<eos> -Will he call you?<eos> -I'm sure he will.
Don't you have any feelings at all?<eos> Do you want to live a normal life?<eos> I'm afraid you've got the wrong person<eos> Charlene is dead<eos> Listen Charlene... or whatever you want to call yourself...<eos> We're stuck here and it's cold... and to be honest<eos> I don't know how much longer I can keep my arm up<eos> I knew you wouldn't kill me<eos> It's not that I can't.<eos> I won't
You can't go away on your own.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I want to get home.<eos> Are you O K?<eos> Yeah, I won.<eos> No.<eos> First to get a kiss off Mom.<eos> - Kiss me!<eos> - Kiss me!<eos> I won't!
So she can try to talk me out of it?<eos> She's your wife, David.<eos> This is her life, too.<eos> She deserves to know.<eos> Has the compound been cleared?<eos> Yes, but there's been a change of plan.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Bauer showed up here like I said he would.<eos> You have him.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
I made some phone calls.<eos> Just following up on a rumour.<eos> I can't tell you any more than that.<eos> You will tell me more, and I will not ask you again.<eos> I am not a member of your staff, David.<eos> I am your wife.<eos> Ex-wife, and you will tell me because the safety and security of this country is more important than your power plays.<eos> You know, despite everything that's happened, I love you.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - No, I always will.
-It's 20 years ago, high school.<eos> But we've come a long way since then, haven't we?<eos> -What are you trying to do?<eos> -Richard.<eos> She hurt you.<eos> You're still angry.<eos> Pain doesn't decompose when you bury it.<eos> And that is a Claire Otom-ism.<eos> Dr. Liston said I can come and visit whenever I want.<eos> -And will you?
I'm losing maneuvering control.<eos> Time to get rid of our uninvited guests.<eos> Slipstream?<eos> Too close to gravitational pull of that planet.<eos> Close is good.<eos> We've got fleas.<eos> Let's give Andromeda a bath.<eos> You're taking us into their atmosphere?<eos> I'm guessing these parasites won't like it.<eos> Yeah, neither will we.
Red T-shirt your dark-blue blue jeans, gray boots.<eos> Oh. Was I right about any of it?<eos> Okay, that was just a warm-up.<eos> Yellow long-sleeve tee gray cords, tan boots.<eos> See?<eos> Record secure. Never takes me more than twice.<eos> Me?<eos> Maybe you should come over here and find out.<eos> Of course, if it takes you too long...<eos> - It won't.
What time is it?<eos> It's late.<eos> I just wanna...<eos> I love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I know I haven't been everything I should be.<eos> Everything Mom was.<eos> But I love you.<eos> I always will.
But it's only a matter of time.<eos> And after The Source has fully assimilated you, his power will protect you, shield you from her premonitions.<eos> That we can wait for.<eos> Unfortunately with Kurzon, we cannot.<eos> Kurzon?<eos> The underworld's in chaos.<eos> The Source is presumed dead, and Kurzon will attempt to fill that void.<eos> We must stop him, or you'll never reclaim the throne.<eos> - I don't want the throne.<eos> - You will.
Maybe we could go with you and watch your back.<eos> That's an awful lot to ask of her right now.<eos> I know, but what choice do we have?<eos> There's gonna be a coronation tonight unless we stop it.<eos> How does it feel?<eos> Heavy.<eos> Focus.<eos> What's the point?<eos> - We don't even have the Grimoire.<eos> - We will.
I'm not wet or anything.<eos> I'm not gonna dirty the house.<eos> I'll wipe my feet.<eos> I'd love to make a concession... - An exception?<eos> - An exception. But I can't, 'cause I'll get in trouble by Mr. Mellon, so...<eos> I know Mr. Mellon. I wouldn't worry about it, okay?<eos> - You know Hugh?<eos> - I know Hugh and it's no problem.<eos> - I'll get in trouble.<eos> - You won't.
That's why they're not telling anybody.<eos> We got to get out of here.<eos> - Yeah, get out of here. - This weekend there's a big... NRDC benefit that we've been working on for months.<eos> Alanis Morissette is gonna be there.<eos> I'm just, I'm thinking out loud.<eos> Why don't we call the terrorists and ask them could they pick another weekend more suited for you?<eos> Postpone the benefit, let's get out of here.<eos> I thought I'd never say this, but Larry's right.<eos> If we don't show up at the benefit,<eos> - what will people... - lf?
Easy, easy. Your sexual frustration's hitting a vein.<eos> Anyway, we're meeting in the cafeteria after class.<eos> Can I come?<eos> C.J. will probably be there.<eos> Jen, don't you think you've given this the old college try?<eos> This much effort's beneath you. You said so yourself, didn't you?<eos> Oh, you can't hold the ultimatums of party Jen against me.<eos> I was wearing a wig. Feeling crazy. All right.<eos> Hey, tell you what. Bring Grams too.<eos> -Maybe I will.
Something every father should impart to his daughter.<eos> I finally got it.<eos> Generosity.<eos> Be generous with your time with your love with your life.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry, Rachel.<eos> - I'm so tired.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Don't cry for me.<eos> I won't.
Okay.<eos> So I gotta get to Midway.<eos> Wait.<eos> I updated my will last year, but-<eos> Look at it out there.<eos> It's gonna take me hours.<eos> I want to start a college fund.<eos> Well, you'll drop Rachel off in St. Louis in July. We can talk then.<eos> - I don't know if I'll be able to make that.<eos> - Yes, you will.
On the same street as the library.<eos> - It was obviously never built.<eos> - Why is that a problem?<eos> - Who did it commemorate?<eos> - Not "who."<eos> - Then what?<eos> - An organisation.<eos> The Federation.<eos> It doesn't exist for you, not yet.<eos> But it will?
What?<eos> What is it?<eos> Are you moving us to Zimbabwe or something?<eos> No no.<eos> It's nothing like that.<eos> I was just thinking about something.<eos> It's funny actually.<eos> Well it's not so much funny "ha ha" as...<eos> You see the thing is... I don't know whether or not you've ever had sex.<eos> And you never will.
She's the instructor here now.<eos> I'm going to say hello.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well... everything we've found proves our races are linked.<eos> Maybe you should stay... study what we discover.<eos> Wish I could.<eos> You know I can't.<eos> That Aeryn links, right?<eos> Take care.<eos> I will.
You made your expectations clear and I didn't meet them.<eos> But there was a reason which I have taken care of.<eos> If I tried to do anything last semester it was to prove how much I care.<eos> It was to prove how important this is to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - But it better not happen again.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
I'm sorry, Dr. Crane.<eos> I'm forced to do the laundry downstairs, and I guess your socks are just too tempting to the neighbours.<eos> Of course, you're welcome to go down there yourself and stand guard.<eos> I see.<eos> And if we had our own washer-dryer, there would be no more lost socks.<eos> I will not be strong-armed by threats against my laundry.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> I'm off to do a load of your pinks.<eos> - I don't have any pinks.<eos> - You will.
-Good, you haven't left yet.<eos> -Where have you been?<eos> I got held up at Dr. GettIeman's office.<eos> There was some guy that freaked everybody out.<eos> I don't think I'm going back there.<eos> You got here just in time.<eos> I really have to go, buddy.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> -Promise to call me when you land?<eos> -Of course I will.
You won't be sorry.<eos> It's suddenly becoming clear to me that I'm an old man.<eos> I don't recognize half the whatsits and doodads in here.<eos> Here we have an assortment of magic sticks... and when you press down on paper, writing comes out.<eos> I know what pens are.<eos> Good.<eos> Pick out your favorites, and I'll try to figure out how to explain Liquid Paper.<eos> You're cute.<eos> - I can't possibly use all of those.<eos> - You won't.
I repeat, whatever it takes.<eos> Listen, isn't this kind of academic?<eos> We're stranded here, remember?<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Get a lock on the Javelin.<eos> You asked when you would receive your kingdom, my son.<eos> Before the clock strikes 12, before this All Hallows Eve ends the world will be yours.<eos> A castle, Mother.<eos> I must have my own castle.<eos> And so you will.
I've seen your arrest record.<eos> It's very impressive.<eos> Ever since I was a Iittle boy, all I wanted to be was a detective.<eos> Thrill of the chase?<eos> I make a collar, I get a real rush.<eos> The same rush you get when a beautiful woman comes on to you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's kind of the same, you know?<eos> It's like a game.<eos> "Will she?
Not guilty, Your Honor.<eos> I'II hear from the People on bail.<eos> $100,000.<eos> COHEN: For an A misdemeanor?<eos> CABOT: He has insufficient community ties, poses an ongoing threat, and, we believe, is a flight risk.<eos> He has limited financial means, no criminal record, and given the non-violent crime he's been charged with, I see no threat to the community.<eos> Your honor, Mr. Dilbert is the number-one suspect in the rape of a comatose patient.<eos> We believe this heightens the flight risk considerably.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't see an indictment on that charge.<eos> You will.
I hear you found Marjorie Empson's silver. Yes.<eos> Say 'Ah'.<eos> Outside Ginny Sharp's house.<eos> And again.<eos> Aaaaah.<eos> You've got to stop it, James.<eos> Everyone knows that Ginny Sharp likes to sunbathe in the nude and people are beginning to talk about your rambles along the bridle path.<eos> Yes, well she's such a gorgeous creature.<eos> Not the sort of woman I'd ever stand a chance with.<eos> And never will.
Got her, got her.<eos> What's going on?<eos> My God. What happened?<eos> She's been shot.<eos> Kyle, there's a trauma kit in the garage, get it.<eos> Go!<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I don't wanna die, please.<eos> - Please, I don't wanna die.<eos> JESSE: You won't.
Hey, Dr Kelso.<eos> Save it for the bathhouses, sport.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Don't be angry at Bambi.<eos> I'm not. My girlfriend serviced most of the staff.<eos> I'm proud of her commitment to medicine.<eos> What about the women you've slept with?<eos> Your ex-wife, that med student, your ex-wife, the radiology nurse, your ex-wife...<eos> - Would you get off my ex-wife?<eos> - I will if you will.
- But you say you help Sun-Lee. - I am.<eos> This is the best thing for you.<eos> - You don't know what like there.<eos> - I know what it's like here.<eos> - Parents never take me back!<eos> - Lf they won't, the authorities will.<eos> You'll be sent to a foster home, to school.<eos> Someone will look after you.<eos> - Sun-Lee come back.<eos> I will.
- What?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not taking on any more law students right now.<eos> No, no, I'm not a law student.<eos> Wait, I know you.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah, you run the coffee place in town.<eos> Yeah, yeah, the Talon.<eos> I don't think I've seen you there.<eos> And you never will.
- I wish.<eos> - I know.<eos> Who's Chet Collins?<eos> Chet Collins is a contractor from Rockaway who liked nothing more... than to take his kids camping in the Catskills each summer.<eos> On one trip, his son Sean disappeared in the middle of the night from his tent.<eos> Stolen, wandered off, no one knows.<eos> And that was five years ago.<eos> Jack stayed close with this guy?<eos> We all have our Chet Collinses.<eos> You will, too.
I'll get him alone.<eos> Mrs. Buckman, a veteran prosecutor, appeared drained of emotion... as she concluded a brief press conference just a few moments ago.<eos> I hate that we have to do that.<eos> Abby's face is plastered across every Trinitron in the city.<eos> That kind of publicity can't hurt.<eos> It's a tough bargain because either way... their personal tragedy becomes film at 11.<eos> They're just doing their job.<eos> Yeah, after some ambitious reporter goes behind your back... with an exclusive that blows your case, you might feel a little differently.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Like, uh... maybe something you'd find in an X-File.<eos> If that's what you came looking for, then you came a long way for nothing.<eos> - Then what's with the cavalry?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> A lot of good shoes out here looking for what's gotta be a dead man.<eos> The guy was killed, right?<eos> A man survives a fall like this, on fire?<eos> It's not very likely.<eos> You got a body?<eos> We will, Agent Doggett.
Who authorises you?<eos> I mean, what gives you the right?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm the future, Agent Scully.<eos> And I risked my life being here.<eos> Then why do it?<eos> I mean, why meet me?<eos> You can reach Mulder.<eos> He needs to know what I know, or he may have no future.<eos> Perhaps no one will.
Who are "they", Jesse?<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> Add that to your list, too.<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> The only way to cover enough ground before nightfall is to split up.<eos> Any problems, blow your whistles.<eos> Keep blowing until the rest of us can get to where you are.<eos> Sam's offered to help us look.<eos> One more thing... Someone has to stay here, just in case Daryl comes back while we're out looking for him.<eos> I will.
- I think I understand.<eos> - What?<eos> - This book.<eos> It's how we do it.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> If he reads from it, it'll send him back.<eos> My vision showed what happened to that girl Fred.<eos> The portal works both ways.<eos> - And if it sends something here?<eos> - It won't.
You're gonna have me killed.<eos> Why couldn't you have had such foresight when we needed it?<eos> We are telling the truth.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Intelligence is coming in.<eos> No one knows how Darla got pregnant.<eos> There's a prophecy involving a vampire birth but the scroll it' s recorded on is missing.<eos> Do you have any idea how many groups and cults would kill to get their hands on this baby?<eos> - We gotta get it before anybody knows.<eos> - And we will.
Go to the village, call out the Groosalugg and kill him.<eos> Kill their undefeated champion?<eos> - I can't, I'll turn into the beast.<eos> - I know.<eos> When I fired you guys, the reason I....<eos> The darkness was coming out of me.<eos> I didn't want you near it.<eos> The thing that comes out here is 10 times worse.<eos> I do this, you know I won't come back from it.<eos> Yes, you will.
The only part that I...<eos> We'll solve this.<eos> We will.<eos> Don't have another coma, OK?<eos> If the ritual starts, every living creature in this and every other dimension imaginable will suffer unbearable torment and death.<eos> including Dawn.<eos> Then the last thing she'll see is me protecting her.<eos> You'll fail.<eos> You'll die.<eos> We all will.
Let me remind you you have the right to counsel.<eos> I don't need counsel.<eos> The only person I was hiding from was my wife.<eos> She knows everything now.<eos> So, ask your questions.<eos> We found some of Paige's hair in your car.<eos> That's impossible, because she's never been in my car.<eos> Are you sure it was hers?<eos> Do you mean will it stand up in court?<eos> Yes, it will.
I had to close the door.<eos> The whole house would've gone up and the firemen would have never reached them.<eos> I killed my family.<eos> Carbon monoxide killed them long before the fire got to them.<eos> You know that.<eos> It doesn't matter what I know.<eos> My family died because I wasn't there to protect them.<eos> You tried to save your family but that doesn't mean that you didn't start the fire.<eos> Are you lying about that, too?<eos> I will.
This is weakening you, making you vulnerable.<eos> But the bounty I seek will make me more powerful than ever.<eos> If you can get it.<eos> Nobody knows more about the Charmed Ones than I do.<eos> I know how to break her spirit.<eos> I know her Achilles' heel.<eos> In her deepest heart, she never wanted to be a witch.<eos> Yet she feels an obligation to her powers.<eos> Yes, but you said her powers won't work in our illusion.<eos> They won't.
- How do we do that?<eos> - By kicking ass.<eos> All right.<eos> One.<eos> Two.<eos> Three.<eos> - Anybody else want a piece of this?<eos> - It looks really bad.<eos> - I don't know if we'll make it to Leo.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
I've just been thinking about things lately why things are the way they are and I'm just not gonna know until I see him.<eos> But you should take in the city.<eos> You got one day and so much stuff to see.<eos> And I'm-<eos> - You know, I'm gonna be fine, most likely.<eos> Just meet me at 8:00 in front of the Mercer Hotel for dinner, okay?<eos> You were paying attention to my schedule.<eos> -Be careful out there.<eos> -l feel like I won't see you again.<eos> You will.

Not a single trauma in the bunch.<eos> Hello.<eos> - That's mine. What are you doing?<eos> - Go home, Dave.<eos> - I'm on till 8:00.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> In fact, you're not on for the rest of the week.<eos> - Wait. Says who? - Says me.<eos> - Does Weaver know about this?<eos> - She will.
- A wellknown hothead.<eos> - True.<eos> I told Da'an this morning what happened,... so he wouldn't keep looking at me funny.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wonder what it was like, though.<eos> What he...<eos> What I saw in those final moments?<eos> Well don't be in such a hurry.<eos> You'll find out one day<eos> We all will.
Yes, Sean, but we needed this job.<eos> - No, we didn't.<eos> - What?<eos> That's what a partner like me does for you.<eos> It gives you freedom to say no.<eos> You don't have to listen to that bozo.<eos> You know that I have a zillion other jobs waiting to be lined up.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, I will.

We're having it here.<eos> You're invited.<eos> To my own apartment?<eos> Thanks.<eos> - So are you.<eos> - lsn't he?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You should come.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks. I will.
I don't guess anything I do will make you feel for me the way I feel for you.<eos> I guess not.<eos> The doomsday device is ready.<eos> Maybe blasting this space into a storm of nothingness will cheer me up.<eos> Okay, let me just take the ship out to a safe distance.<eos> Actually, I think I'll go and prep the detonator.<eos> Fry, why don't you take the helm.<eos> She's so great.<eos> I almost remember the thing I did to make her love me.<eos> But I never will.
These boys just completed the first leg of their outdoor-survival training.<eos> Meaning you had them sit under a tree and glue rocks together.<eos> You're a very jaded man.<eos> What happened to you as a child?<eos> A creepy guy in shorts and knee socks tried to sit me under a tree... and glue rocks together.<eos> - Put that down.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Otherwise you're going under it.<eos> - I won't fit.<eos> - Yes, you will.
I just didn't want them talking about me anymore, that's all.<eos> - It worked.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Lf you ever wanna talk...<eos> - We are not friends.<eos> That I know.<eos> But if you ever do want to talk about...<eos> I will, if I want to.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - But I probably won't.
- Getting water.<eos> - You're shameless.<eos> - He offered.<eos> - Please.<eos> The first thing he said to me was, 'Lorelai, can I change your water?<eos> What can I do?<eos> The kid's a freak.<eos> I'm so sorry she's got you doing chores already.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> You will.
STABLER:<eos> Was he drugged? CABOT: He doesn't need to be.<eos> Was there even a weapon?<eos> None listed.<eos> Happened at the bachelorette party.<eos> Mob attack isn't unheard of. CABOT:<eos> Did the uniforms follow up on the suspect's complaint?<eos> They asked a few questions, and then they dropped it.<eos> Because they didn't buy it and neither do I.<eos> And more importantly, neither will a jury.
- What?<eos> I think that's a yes.<eos> What if you like my lip gloss?<eos> Yeah, well, yes ... I mean Why not say yes to all your questions?<eos> Hey nothing wrong You say many sweet things<eos> What else are you good?<eos> Many things<eos> Why do not you say something?<eos> Maybe I will.<eos> "Maybe I'll like "Maybe you like
- Let's dance...<eos> - Let's dance.<eos> This is it big man, the big night.<eos> Yeah, this is it.<eos> I envy you Valenti.<eos> All right. Look at that compact little body.<eos> All right.<eos> Bet she's a firecracker in the sack.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Yeah well, you will soon.
Yes. I know. It's a lot better than it looks.<eos> Ok, we're already holding the presses for this.<eos> I understand.<eos> And as much as I think that we're all devastated about Alex, I don't think that it's in the wishes of the student body to not get their yearbooks until after graduation.<eos> Look. If you could just give me 48 hours--<eos> Ok. Maybe we should think about compromising a little.<eos> I mean, do you really need to have every single piece of memorabilia in the collage?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do, and I will--we will-<eos> - Liz and I will.
This is tamponade.<eos> Viral infections can cause pericarditis and a rapid accumulation of fluid.<eos> It looks like a heart attack but don't let it fool you.<eos> BP's stabilizing.<eos> - What have we got?<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> We're fine here.<eos> It's a universal feeling to want to be there for a good friend.<eos> So from now on, I'm going to stop seeing Turk as my crazy frat brother.<eos> Dr Turk, if you will?
Yeah.<eos> There's a lot of history there.<eos> Did you know it predates agriculture?<eos> - Let's walk.<eos> Finish the job.<eos> I just don't understand Francine's motivation.<eos> Why does she only go after the smart ones?<eos> That's like asking the square root of a million.<eos> No one will ever know.<eos> Someone will.
I'm used to people crying and being exhausted. People being shattered!<eos> Do not worry.<eos> We get funerals too.<eos> I'm so happy.<eos> I can't wait to come back tomorrow.<eos> You're not going to be like this every day, though, right?<eos> This flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation as a token of our appreciation for honorable and faithful services rendered by your loved one.<eos> Give it to one of his friends.<eos> I love you, David.<eos> I always will.
Okay, just wait.<eos> 'Cause I... I just...<eos> I wanna do this right.<eos> Jackie... from the first minute that I saw you...<eos> I knew that I wanted to fool around with you.<eos> And then, after we did that... and I still wanted to talk to you?<eos> I knew that I never wanted to be without you.<eos> So... will you accept my ring?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Michael, I will.
- So, had any ideas for names, Yancy?<eos> - I'm sort of thinking one.<eos> Daddy has a present for you. Know what it is?<eos> It's a lucky clover to help you be successful, even at breakdancing.<eos> It belonged to someone very special.<eos> I know what name you want to give him. It's okay.<eos> Really?<eos> Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honor of my little brother, who I miss every day.<eos> I love you, Philip.<eos> And I always will.
- Have I?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We should invite Monsieur Onegin.<eos> We should, I suppose.<eos> Out of respect to his uncle.<eos> We should ask Tatyana.<eos> It's her name day, after all.<eos> Tanya?<eos> I don't think he'd want to come.<eos> No, he won't.
First, you won't know what to do. You'll be a bit scared.<eos> Then you'll meet one of them.<eos> You'll talk to him.<eos> Somehow you just know.<eos> Are you quite certain you're prepared to handle his uniqueness?<eos> Oh, my, yes.<eos> His uniqueness is a perfect fit for the Little family.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Little, we try to discourage couples from adopting children outside their own species.<eos> It rarely works out.<eos> Well, it will in this case.
Terry, we're trying to hunt them down. My soldiers are out there. What more can I do?<eos> And if he comes here?<eos> And, what if he does?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, you don't want to tell me about this?<eos> About being here with the bodyguards and everything.<eos> I don't suppose you've ever had anything like enemies.<eos> Well, I never went out for the cheerleading squad, and I never stole anyone's boyfriend that I know of.<eos> So no. I'd like to think not.<eos> You never will.
That I know. Precisely.<eos> But ifthis crisis isn't resolved soon and a country under our protection is threatened, we will have no choice but to defend our interests.<eos> Our protection?<eos> Our interests?<eos> The ways of England are the ways ofthe world, my dear.<eos> They are the ways of one world, Lady Bradley.<eos> One I am ashamed to call my own.<eos> You forget yourself, madam.<eos> Now ifyou'll excuse us.<eos> No, I will not.
I've got this article.<eos> Wednesday?<eos> Let me check.<eos> Would Thursday do?<eos> Good. The Park Lane Hotel at 1 ?<eos> It was odd to think that during the war we could be so totally at peace.<eos> There were nights when I wished those sirens would never end.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I always will.
What would clinch it for us, Parkis?<eos> What would make divorce a certainty?<eos> Generally, sir, some kind of photographic evidence of....<eos> Of intimacy.<eos> Would be most useful, sir, if it came to such a pass.<eos> It will, Parkis.<eos> It certainly will.<eos> Here, here, drink this.<eos> I dreamt we had a child.<eos> We will.
Anything else?<eos> Matt, you deal with this.<eos> I think that means she wants you to follow her.<eos> Don't you want the room, Hannah?<eos> Small town.<eos> What'd you need the sheriff for?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Maybe she doesn't want to be a part of this either.<eos> I told you, nothing's changed.<eos> - It will.
-Sorry.<eos> Don't give me that look, I'm not ordering you around.<eos> -Whatever you say.<eos> -Don't be agreeable.<eos> I'm not being agreeable.<eos> I can be if you want me to.<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> I'm trying to tell you something important here.<eos> I'm not going to live forever.<eos> Yes, you will.
Young and old, women and children in one day?<eos> The 13th day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar;<eos> and to plunder their goods...<eos> And let this decree be issued in every province by proclamation, calling on all the peoples to prepare and make ready for that day.<eos> Your Persian king is going to kill us! No, no.<eos> It cannot be.<eos> We have lived here for years.<eos> They are our friends...<eos> They won't allow this to happen.<eos> They won't.
- Hello, Pasqualino.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Gegè!<eos> So, have you become a priest?<eos> No, don Gioachino deceived me.<eos> Have you heard about the ruckus here?<eos> And now... I'm leaving, going home.<eos> Can you do me a favor?<eos> Will you say hello to your teacher?<eos> - Yes, I will.
So buy it back.<eos> How much?<eos> 20,000 yen.<eos> That's too much.<eos> It's only worth 2,000.<eos> 2,000 wholesale?<eos> So make it 3,000.<eos> Fork it over!<eos> - Okay, I'll pay.<eos> - Damn right, you will!
Now, allow me to show you around.<eos> Oh, my, you have a pert elbow.<eos> You must be Gina Carbonara.<eos> Yes, and you must be Mr Thwaite.<eos> It's "Twat. " Damn...<eos> I'm sorry, please, forgive me, Mr Twat.<eos> Yes.<eos> I have a problem, could you come into my room?<eos> - No...<eos> - You won't?
Hush.<eos> Lie still. It will be all right.<eos> You'll soon feel better.<eos> You have enough stones here to finish the windmill.<eos> I think I may now be allowed to stop.<eos> Yes, of course, you must stop.<eos> I will enjoy my retirement.<eos> If any animal deserves to rest, it's you, Boxer.<eos> Here, try to drink some water.<eos> Yes, yes, I will.
You did the right thing.<eos> We don't know each other.<eos> But I'm sure you will get what you want.<eos> You've ruined everything!<eos> No tension. Come on out. I'll handle them.<eos> Yes brother?<eos> "The keys, please."<eos> - Strip.<eos> - No!<eos> I won't!
Then why do you work in a private clinic that charges two million pesetas for a hip operation?<eos> Maybe you're the one who has a problem with me.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't stand to see you get hurt.<eos> If you don't want to see me get hurt, take a deep breath, relax, and shut up.<eos> You're not helping anyone like this.<eos> I'll get over this, Eva.<eos> Of course you will.
I talked to this dealer who 'd been busted.<eos> I asked him what the narc who busted him looked like.<eos> What did he say, he looked just like us?<eos> More so.<eos> So I guess the moral of that is stay away from guys looking the same as us.<eos> Well, there are female narcs.<eos> Oh, hey, I'd like to meet one of those. No, I don 't mean a female.<eos> I mean just the narc, knowingly, like, positive.<eos> Sure. So you could positively know.<eos> And you will.
- All those deductions were permitted.<eos> - But this one is a little dicey.<eos> - Are you saying I could be prosecuted?<eos> I have one last meeting with him.<eos> I'll try to make it go away.<eos> - I was terrible in that meeting.<eos> - We'll see what we can do.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You'll call?<eos> - We will.
So, what happens now?<eos> The Oracles are giving us back the day, turning back time so I can kill Mohra before his blood makes me mortal.<eos> When?<eos> Another minute.<eos> A minute?<eos> No.<eos> - No, it's not enough time.<eos> - We don't have a choice.<eos> How am I supposed to go on with my life knowing what we had, what we could've had?<eos> You won't.
Because if I'm the perfect daughter, that makes you the perfect mother, right?<eos> I don't deserve that!<eos> I don't push for me.<eos> I push for you so that you don't spend half your life not knowing where you belong.<eos> Yeah? Well, you've done a great job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who's ever gonna want me like this?<eos> Don't cry.<eos> Who's ever gonna want me like this?<eos> Nobody will.
- Papers, you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm slow that way. You'll need to be specific.<eos> I want forged documents to China.<eos> Okay. You said "forged."<eos> We'll do it.<eos> Now have a seat.<eos> Or not.<eos> - I don't have much time.<eos> - As you will.
It doesn't matter.<eos> Because I've had it.<eos> I'm taking my children and I'm getting out of here.<eos> What do you mean your children?<eos> They're my children.<eos> How about our children?<eos> And you think I'm just gonna let you take them away from me?<eos> There's nothing you can do about it and you know it.<eos> We'll see what a lawyer has to say about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
I want you to go downstairs now and apologize to Lena.<eos> Apologize for getting drunk.<eos> I know you did because Mrs. Potter told me.<eos> Go downstairs and say you're sorry... and tell her that you hope we have a nice honeymoon.<eos> Go downstairs right now and say it!<eos> I won't say that.<eos> - Won't?<eos> - No.<eos> I'll tell her your have a mole on your left ass cheek.<eos> - I will.
It succeeded.<eos> I would have expected!<eos> All my life!<eos> The work of my life!<eos> For a young idiot!<eos> Good.<eos> Enough.<eos> I've had enough of this machine.<eos> You hold?<eos> You will.
Routine stuff as you say, captain, but good experience and I'll have a chance to see them in a non-training environment.<eos> You're coming?<eos> Yes, captain.<eos> I want to observe these men at close hand.<eos> Well, what about opposition?<eos> It's all deserted.<eos> We're just confirming that.<eos> But say we do encounter activity.<eos> Miners, refugees of some sort?<eos> Well, we won't.
I'll be there.<eos> And when it's over we'll be the strongest we've ever been... 'cause we'll have been through this together.<eos> Then we'll be on the same level and there'll be nothing we can't accomplish.<eos> That time is over for me.<eos> I've been there and I've done it... and I didn't find what I was looking for in any of it.<eos> I found that it you.<eos> Doing this won't help you forget about the things you're hung up on.<eos> - It'll create more. - No.<eos> I've thought about all that.<eos> Yes, it will!
I've been down roads like this before. Many times.<eos> I know you feel doing this will broaden your horizons... and give you experience.<eos> But I've had those experiences, on my own. And I can't accompany you on yours.<eos> I'm past that now.<eos> Or maybe I just love you too much. And I feel hurt and let down that you would want to share me with anyone.<eos> Because I would never want to share you.<eos> Regardless, I can't be a part of this. Or you.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Of course not.<eos> What kind of heel do you think I am?<eos> This information is only for members of the Sally-Don club.<eos> There are only 2 members.<eos> You and me, Don?<eos> Me and you.<eos> Can Tommy join?<eos> No.<eos> Good. Because there's a part of me that feels like if anybody else found out about it, it'll stop being our thing, and I don't ever want it to stop being that.<eos> It never will.
I didn't want to say anything in front of others.<eos> This whole situation is problematic enough as it is but the suspect was also being trained in attack probes.<eos> He has a knack for disrupting other telepaths.<eos> He's a mind shredder, Al.<eos> Let him get too close, let him get a clear shot and he'll rip you in two.<eos> Why?<eos> Why'd you do it?<eos> Because I could.<eos> You know something went wrong but you don't know what.<eos> And you never will.
- But, in the end...<eos> - Years?<eos> But...<eos> Oh! Interesting thing:<eos> time moves more quickly here than in your reality.<eos> A hundred long years will pass here. On Earth, it's just a day.<eos> So you just work us till we're too old and spit us back out.<eos> That's the plan.<eos> You see, Lily, you'll die of old age before anyone wonders where you went.<eos> Not that anyone will.
We have a lot of fun, but I want smoochies!<eos> - Have you dropped any hints?<eos> - I've dropped anvils.<eos> Oh, he'll come around.<eos> What guy could resist your wily Willow charms?<eos> At last count, all of 'em, maybe more.<eos> None of them know a thing.<eos> They all get an F in Willow.<eos> But I want Oz to get an A. And oh, one of those gold stars.<eos> - He will.
(Screams) Tell me!<eos> I have the killer.<eos> No.<eos> I have him here.<eos> You don't have to go on now.<eos> I think I do.<eos> If I'd listened to my father instead of my... ..instead of him... ..my father would still be alive.<eos> The guilt for what has happened... ..is not yours.<eos> I have it, though.<eos> I always will.
You said if I brought them back their cat...<eos> Was it the oldest?<eos> Was it Prue who sent you away?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Avoid her.<eos> She's the strongest.<eos> You must separate them.<eos> Together they're charmed, impenetrable.<eos> - But what if they don't want me?<eos> - Phoebe will.
I, um, I can still call it our house, can't I?<eos> - Yes. It is our house.<eos> - I don't know, Mitch.<eos> I don't know if I can do this.<eos> - Yes you can because you have to<eos> - But why?<eos> Why do I have to?<eos> - Because no matter how big our house is, right now it's far too small for the two of us.<eos> - Well, just remember, Mitch. The door to this house is always open.<eos> - I will.
I think you should see Mark.<eos> Hey, Doug. I just got a call from Neal Bernstein.<eos> He said your ER fellowship-renewal papers were due two days ago.<eos> You can't blow this off.<eos> If you want this to continue-<eos> Kerry, maybe I don't want my fellowship to continue.<eos> Got a kid in Exam 4 with a pencil up his nose.<eos> - We need to discuss this.<eos> - All right.<eos> We will.
Sure.<eos> Okay, ready?<eos> Feeling any better?<eos> All right, I guess.<eos> What did you...? What did you give me?<eos> Haldol, to calm you down.<eos> I can't take that.<eos> It's not good for my baby.<eos> Coco, you don't have a baby.<eos> But I will, really.
Want to bet?<eos> I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far.<eos> How about we play for more money? Say 1 50?<eos> One hundred and fifty dollars.<eos> Say 200?<eos> Two hundred dollars!<eos> You're doing it again.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> -l don't want to lose $200.<eos> -We won't.
Back in high school I had a major crush on you.<eos> I knew.<eos> You did?<eos> I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.<eos> I did.<eos> Listen, do you think<eos> Try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor.<eos> Would it be okay if I asked you out sometime?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Okay, maybe I will.
All right.<eos> There's a group therapy session later on.<eos> One of you can watch from behind the glass.<eos> OK.<eos> Grab a chair.<eos> Semicircle.<eos> I know we're doing this for all the right reasons, but deep down I can't help but feel like I'm betraying them.<eos> They'll never know I'm here.<eos> I know, but I do.<eos> And I always will.
That somehow the atoms in your body vaporize into molecules which are then magically transported to another plane.<eos> There's no magic involved.<eos> I deatomize here, and I reatomize somewhere else.<eos> Well, I'm sure we'd all like to see that.<eos> Wouldn't you, Mr. Mallory?<eos> I don't think you can call what I do deatomizing.<eos> Okay?<eos> I jump into a vortex, a wormhole that takes me through a tunnel that leads to another dimension, another world.<eos> Well, I'm sure we'd all like to see that, too, wouldn't we?<eos> Maybe you will, wise guy.

Order some nozala sandwiches.<eos> Computer accessed.<eos> Get them to deliver some extra vilm sauce.<eos> - Who should I bill this time?<eos> - l don't care, just so long as it isn't us.<eos> - How about the police?<eos> - We billed them for last night's dinner.<eos> Municipal sanitation.<eos> Do you have their account code?<eos> I will...in a minute.
And he wouldn't just bail without telling Batgirl or Nightwing.<eos> -What do they think?<eos> -Batgirl traced the phone call to Romania.<eos> They went over to find some guy who might've kidnapped him.<eos> -"Ghoul" something.<eos> -So you're handling the whole city yourself?<eos> During a crime spree?<eos> Not again.<eos> It gets worse every time he doesn't show.<eos> Then, this time, he will.
This is what Alex Krycek knew - that a war had begun.<eos> What good was that knowledge?<eos> Without the vaccine for the black oil, no one can survive.<eos> We have a vaccine.<eos> Developed by the Russians, stolen by Krycek, given to me.<eos> You see what this means?<eos> Resistance is possible.<eos> We have the weapons and the magic in hand.<eos> - We don't know the vaccine works.<eos> - It will.
"River of Wailing", is it?<eos> Look out!<eos> I thought you were different from her.<eos> I thought you had a regard for life, no matter whose.<eos> You're not going to die, Crassus.<eos> I said I'd switch you.<eos> Now if the guards recognize who you are, I have no control over that.<eos> Don't rely on that.<eos> Most of Rome doesn't know what I look like, let alone the prison guards.<eos> You will with this.
Probably out sewing your wild oats.<eos> Ya make me sick.<eos> Go on, get outta here!<eos> You don't wanna be doing that, Meg.<eos> So, the little virgin wants to play rough, huh?<eos> How'd you like a trip to Mount Olympus, courtesy of my fist?<eos> -Hello, Xena.<eos> -Hello, Meg.<eos> Oh, very well, I will play the part of the wetched lush Meg..., ...but I hardly think anyone will be fooled.<eos> Yes, they will.
Another second, I would've been in the trees.<eos> I promised Xena I'd switch you for Vercinix. [ Groans ]<eos> Then you really are in the middle of it.<eos> I thought you were different from her.<eos> I thought you had a regard for life, no matter whose.<eos> You're not going to die, Crassus.<eos> I said I'd switch you.<eos> If the guards recognize who you are, I have no control over that.<eos> Most of Rome doesn't know what I look like, let alone the prison guards.<eos> You will with this.
Yes.<eos> Which grade are you in?<eos> First.<eos> In Mrs. Malehi's class?<eos> No, Mrs. Hashemi's.<eos> The 2nd classroom on the 2nd floor, you see?<eos> Just stay here.<eos> Your mother will be here any minute.<eos> And what if she doesn't come?<eos> She will.
The days go backwards, or forward.<eos> Back and forth, like a wave.<eos> I can't remember my mother.<eos> I lost her a long way back.<eos> I only remember the island.<eos> My island.<eos> The smell of wet grass and the sea and the wind... always around me.<eos> Never leaves me... my friend, the wind.<eos> Father found out that Saulo comes to see me on the beach... But he never saw us.<eos> He never will.
I want you to have this<eos> It's for me?<eos> But why?<eos> Mother gave it to me for my first recital<eos> It was grandmother's.<eos> I don't need it anymore<eos> My fingers are paralyzed<eos> And I've no daughter to pass it on to<eos> Please take it if you will<eos> Oh, I will
But she didn't belong with me.<eos> She belonged to her piano-playing boy who had the right things to give her.<eos> Just as you belong to Danny.<eos> I managed to keep him away from the wedding but just closing the door didn't shut him out, because I made a mistake.<eos> I forgot to hide the piano.<eos> When she saw that well, she didn't hear the "Wedding March" anymore.<eos> She only heard their music that I could never learn to play.<eos> Dearly beloved, we have gathered together here in the sight of God and in the presence of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.<eos> Wilt thou, Noel, have this woman to thy wedded wife so long as ye both shall live?<eos> I will.
- All right.<eos> I actually have something to toast.<eos> My doctorate advisor has asked me to join his researchers going to the Galápagos Islands.<eos> Well, that does deserve a toast.<eos> I'm replacing someone, so it's last minute.<eos> We leave in the morning.<eos> I'll be there for two months inseminating indigenous iguanas.<eos> I called all my friends.<eos> They couldn't believe it.<eos> Nor will mine.
Do you think he'll let me have one?<eos> What?<eos> A monkey.<eos> I like this one.<eos> - I'll ask him.<eos> - Thank you, brother.<eos> Will you kill him, Duncan?<eos> Can you kill him?<eos> If I have to.<eos> You will.
Wow, isn't this great?<eos> Yeah, me too, a girl.<eos> All right.<eos> Way to go, grandpa.<eos> You know, I got a feeling that's gonna happen a lot.<eos> God, I hope so.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Well, I guess I'll have to cut back my time at the magazine.<eos> I'll need to find someone.<eos> Yes, you will.
I mean, not that I wouldn't wanna be.<eos> I mean, I wouldn't wanna be right this second but it's just...<eos> Just been crossing my mind lately.<eos> - I see.<eos> - Actually we're waiting for Dr. Klein to tell us if we can even have kids.<eos> Did you ever have any qualms about raising children after you started trying? I mean, did you...<eos> Did you ever think that you might not be able to handle the responsibility?<eos> No, not once I decided I was ready.<eos> And I'll know that I'm ready for this how, exactly?<eos> You just will.
And good thing.<eos> Look in a mirror one of these days.<eos> You forget your place, busboy.<eos> No, you forget yours.<eos> I have had it with you ordering me around.<eos> I am not your employee anymore.<eos> - I'm your partner.<eos> - Really?<eos> We may know you're really Lex Jr., but no one else does.<eos> And they won't.
- What is it that you want... - ... Junior?<eos> You'll help rebuild LexCorp.<eos> You'll take out my enemies, or my garbage, whichever I want.<eos> You'll do anything I ask.<eos> Because you're cursed with a flaw I don't have.<eos> You can love.<eos> - And you love her.<eos> - I do.<eos> I love her enough to know that she could never exist like this.<eos> But she will.
He's up for reelection in November.<eos> So no-one's been arrested.<eos> No-one's even been brought in for questioning.<eos> It's all accusations.<eos> What's the Group's interest?<eos> Why send me to a small town where something might happen?<eos> If this is more than rumors, it's a horrible crime.<eos> I can't imagine what I'd do if it happened to Jordan.<eos> But child abuse has always happened.<eos> Unfortunately, probably always will.
I really shouldn't be doing this.<eos> Dr Fein doesn't let anybody into this lab.<eos> He gets real paranoid someone's going to poach his data.<eos> Even when I brought him test subjects they could only come in one at a time.<eos> Like the homeless man you were telling me about?<eos> Broad Street Bill?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. In fact Dr Fein did several tests on him.<eos> And you haven't seen him for a year, have you?<eos> And you never will.

There is no follow up.<eos> Candy cases are pro bono.<eos> They should happy to get surgery at all.<eos> Pro bono?<eos> I spent seven years in medical school to operate for free.<eos> Once a week.<eos> Brant's rule.<eos> You know I'm beginning to wonder about this place.<eos> Money, movie stars, so far I've not even seen one single starlet.<eos> For now you won't.
Okay here's a bunch of stuff we own.<eos> All very normal.<eos> Okay let's go and see if dinners ready.<eos> Well it's kinda misleading to call that the grand tour. ..From the hand:towel to the guest:towel, the beach:towel to the bath:sheet.<eos> Towels have helped make our nation great.<eos> Towels.<eos> Okay let's talk about something else.<eos> The collapse of the economy on the Isle of Mann.<eos> Hilda, would you help me clear the table?<eos> - I will too.
Well, I just have one question.<eos> What pet shop is filled with rambunctious yahoos and hot jazz music at 1 a. M?<eos> The best damn pet shop in town.<eos> Yeah!<eos> All right.<eos> But you people remember baby turtles and alligators may seem like a cute idea for a pet but they grow up.<eos> Let's go, boys.<eos> Those gears down there really hurt.<eos> You're out there somewhere, Beer Baron, and I'll find you.<eos> No, you won't.

Hey!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Answer me!<eos> You think there's any chance?<eos> We keep digging till we find her!<eos> Any luck?<eos> They won't help.<eos> What? They warned me not to dig here.<eos> Look, if she's not down too far, we can find her.<eos> Oh, we will.
The war with the Klingons left us a third-rate power.<eos> My people had lost their way.<eos> I've made them strong again.<eos> At what price?<eos> You sold Cardassia to the Dominion.<eos> Yes... a high price, to be sure.<eos> But look what we're getting in return.<eos> The Alpha Quadrant itself.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
It's not your fight, either but I don't see you leaving.<eos> I have to look out for my bar.<eos> And I have to look out for you. Me?<eos> You're my brother.<eos> Whatever happens, we belong together.<eos> Well, like I said, you're an idiot.<eos> On screen, Captain.<eos> General Martok, take a defensive position near the Defiant.<eos> They have to finish deploying those mines no matter the cost.<eos> And they will.
- There's a bond between us.<eos> - No.<eos> Only in your mind.<eos> You are a power-hungry dictator and I want nothing more to do with you.<eos> Ziyal would be disappointed to hear you say that.<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> Please, let's sit down.<eos> We'll talk about it.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
You didn't come to the party last night.<eos> I'm sorry. I couldn't.<eos> I think you know why.<eos> Please don't ask me to choose between you.<eos> I'm not.<eos> There's no choice.<eos> He's your father.<eos> I cannot change past mistakes but from this day forward I promise I will stand with you.<eos> - We'll see if you mean it.<eos> - Yes, we will.
"Look" is the operative word here.<eos> If our hypothesis is right, the nanocytes in your system only imitate ageing.<eos> They weren't meant to start the process in a full-grown adult.<eos> - What are you sayin'? - Without these buggers in your system to maintain the changes, you should return to normal in a week or two.<eos> That is wonderful news!<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was kinda lookin' forward to a little shuffleboard with the fellas.<eos> Then you are leaving?<eos> You will not be staying with me, then?<eos> No, I won't.
No, go ahead.<eos> Didn't mean to disturb you.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You traveling by yourself?<eos> Do you live in DC?<eos> There's a weapon pointed at you right now.<eos> I'm sure at this range it wouldn't just hit you in the leg.<eos> If you so much as raise your arms off your armrest, I'II test that theory.<eos> What if you miss?<eos> I won't.
- But what if he's telling the truth?<eos> A phantom POW left for dead comes back to avenge the injustices?<eos> - Maybe the war ain't over.<eos> - Maybe not Denny Markham's war.<eos> Given the facts of the case and the polygraph test,... ..it's the only explanation we've got.<eos> Or it's a clever story being proffered as a cover-up... ..for an elaborately orchestrated conspiracy.<eos> There is that possibility too.<eos> Let Markham take the polygraph.<eos> - And what if he passes?<eos> - He won't.
- The soldiers, the airmen, the sailors.<eos> - Hey, Teager!<eos> It's me - Leo Danzinger.<eos> I saw you, man. Where are ya?<eos> Behind you.<eos> I... I thought you were dead.<eos> That's what they told us.<eos> That's what they wanted you to believe.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You will.
She cares.<eos> Not exactly good attributes for a true warrior.<eos> Guard them.<eos> First daylight, we take them to the hill.<eos> Boadicea?<eos> Fifteen volunteers are standing by.<eos> They're ready when you are.<eos> At dawn, then.<eos> This had better work, Xena, or I'm going to lose a lot of my best people.<eos> It will.
It was her!<eos> You're not pinning this one on me, rat boy.<eos> You stole our statues?<eos> Hey, now, now, now, calm down, sister.<eos> - We still got your lousy statues.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because if so much as one hair is missing from their heads--<eos> They don't have any heads.<eos> I can't believe these don't come in a lower heel.<eos> Oh, they will.
Scimitar's going commercial.<eos> By the year 2000, that Scimitar chip's gonna be on every airliner in the country.<eos> I feel safer already.<eos> Well, I just want you to know I've been talking to corporate types about you.<eos> You're our best flier, hands down.<eos> - But?<eos> - But I gotta give the test to Dixon on Friday.<eos> I understand.<eos> You don't want a repeat of the last test.<eos> We won't.
Look who's eating at 6:00.<eos> Your suddenly well-to-do president.<eos> Stop it, Jack.<eos> You enjoy your last meal in office.<eos> Tomorrow, when they kick you out you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.<eos> They're not kicking me out.<eos> You don't have the votes.<eos> That's what you think.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yes, we will.
(Mary) How is it the Duke lives?<eos> (assassin) I don't know.<eos> I saw him disappear into the ocean.<eos> He never surfaced.<eos> Obviously, he did.<eos> I trusted you, and you failed me.<eos> My nephew and I have too much invested in this to allow these kinds of mistakes.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> That's right.<eos> It won't.
What?<eos> When we got on the boat, you had a list of your members.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Somewhere. One of your people has gone in the water.<eos> We need to find out who he is.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> You don't care that somebody's been killed?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Of course not. Why would you?
And the whole stadium was getting into it.<eos> And when the ball came over to our seats, you stood up and you just whacked it.<eos> It was the first time I'd seen you smile in forever.<eos> But then the ball went into the aisle... and this usher ran down and grabbed it and he picked it up, and he just squeezed the air out of it.<eos> And then everyone started booing.<eos> Not just the people in our section, but the whole stadium, booing.<eos> He just ruined it for all of them.<eos> They just wanted to hit the ball.<eos> Why would he wanna do that job?<eos> Why would anyone?
First... he wants a meeting.<eos> - And I want it face...<eos> - He wants it face to face.<eos> Is that it?<eos> - He wants it without...<eos> - I want it without old Milt here creeping around in my head.<eos> I said every word.<eos> - Nom?<eos> - Should I use his private number?<eos> I would.

Look. It is all of us.<eos> There's you, teacher na'omi.<eos> You think this looks like me?<eos> Of course it looks like you!<eos> Why wouldn't it?<eos> I like it.<eos> - 10-4!<eos> - Play nice!<eos> My son would've loved this.<eos> Yes, he would.
You don't know all my secrets.<eos> Mm, really?<eos> What are you keeping from me, there, Jeanie?<eos> What are you keeping from me?<eos> Okay, what do you think?<eos> First date or affair?<eos> - Definitely affair.<eos> - Hmm. Too much passion for a first date.<eos> Do you think I'd know if you were having an affair?<eos> Well, I would never.
Did he like the photos?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He seemed to.<eos> See, I told you.<eos> So, um, this might sound like a weird question.<eos> But, um...<eos> Okay, um, let's say that there is someone who somehow managed to know when and where they were going to die.<eos> Would you want to know?<eos> That is a weird question.<eos> But would you?
Lydia Quigley.<eos> Her interest in your family is unnatural.<eos> We must join forces against her.<eos> You've preached hatred on my doorstep for weeks.<eos> My little boy goes to sleep with the sound of your evil in his ears like a cankerous lullaby.<eos> If you will not help for my sake, would you do it for sweet Amelia?<eos> Quigley intends some foulness against her.<eos> Help me, Mrs. Wells.<eos> I see virtue in you and... if I have claimed otherwise in the past, it was a lie.<eos> On any other day I would.
I'm not quite that delicate.<eos> All right?<eos> What have I missed?<eos> Getting a round in.<eos> Oh, great(! ) Fancy another?<eos> No, I'm driving.<eos> Oh, shame.<eos> I'll just get mine then.<eos> Give us a shout if anyone wants one.<eos> I would.
So, like, "Zion" is sort of like the... you know.<eos> And, you know, we've got a bit of resource and stuff.<eos> - Are you speaking creatively?<eos> - Creatively, yeah.<eos> There's only so many coconuts you can eat. Right.<eos> - So we need to go find something.<eos> - You want a banana.<eos> Hypothetically, if we found a fish, could I...<eos> You could eat it.<eos> I wouldn't.
Do you have any children?<eos> It's done.<eos> I've got a guest room upstairs.<eos> Is this alright?<eos> _ Sure.<eos> _ Yeah, it's perfect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you like some supper?<eos> Yeah, we would love some.<eos> I would!
-What are you doing?<eos> -Just give me a second.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> What? You want to find this thing and take another photo?<eos> Yell at it?<eos> This is a terrible idea.<eos> Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.<eos> What? You can tell someone, but they're not gonna believe you.<eos> You know that.<eos> Your mom would.
What is corporal Kilner's status?<eos> Been here three days, and we're short on beds.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I... You're to be the queen of all nurses, you'll need to keep up.<eos> I'm waiting on Dr. Hale.<eos> Dr. Hale?<eos> Is he not on the floor?<eos> I don't know where to find him.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> But alas, I would.
- Thanks for coming.<eos> - Yeah, of course, buddy.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - See you.<eos> Take it easy, man.<eos> It was good to see you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for coming, man.<eos> Sure.<eos> I would...
And Bernard interviews for a job at Birch shortly before the trades.<eos> We have secretaries on both sides confirming the meet.<eos> Birch's trades in arcadian occur a half-hour afterward.<eos> We alerted our counterparts up north.<eos> The railroad has fired Bernard.<eos> The Canadians are considering prosecution.<eos> He's ready to make a statement implicating Birch.<eos> At Quantico, they call a case this straightforward...<eos> Nobody cares.<eos> Of course not. Why would they?
How many butlers can say that?<eos> Here.<eos> Try to take me down.<eos> N-no, no, I don't think...<eos> Please, Miss Carter, I am quite prepared for you.<eos> - Mm. - Really?<eos> - Don't be shy! - Mr. Jarvis, I really wouldn't do that if I...<eos> I shan't hurt you too badly.<eos> I really don't think you want to do that, Mr. Jarvis.<eos> Mr. Jarvis, would you...
How does this even grab on?<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> That is pure class right there.<eos> Oh. This is... this is very much me. Ooh.<eos> Now you have to take up ceramics.<eos> You know, I actually made my mom a mug in summer camp.<eos> - You did?<eos> - I did.<eos> I bet she still has it.<eos> Ha ha. Yeah, she would.
Guys, we got to go get her now.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Cece, let's go!<eos> - Ah, son of a...<eos> - Schmidt, I'm coming!<eos> Let's get her!<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Uh, you coming?<eos> Oh, I would.
You said it.<eos> It'd be for us.<eos> Not for abraham, not for glenn.<eos> Not for maggie.<eos> You're doing it for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So if it all goes right... And you do it...<eos> How do you get away?<eos> It wouldn't matter.<eos> It would to me.
I can see.<eos> Vidal Sassoon's got nothing on you.<eos> Business is business.<eos> Stop giving me the side-eye.<eos> I know how it got there.<eos> Life is so tough you can't make it into your own bunk?<eos> I don't feel good.<eos> I heard that Alex told you how our garden grows.<eos> If you say a word, I'll end you.<eos> I would... never.
Lucky for me, there's a Ralph born every minute.<eos> Hey, Ralph, how about a napkin?<eos> Do I look stupid?<eos> Mmm! Wall licorice. Aah!<eos> Marge, nothing says "I'm sorry" better than flowers.<eos> Except for fundamental behavioral change, but you can't buy that at the supermarket.<eos> They do smell nice.<eos> Hey, Dad, want to hear my solo?<eos> I added a few variations today.<eos> Of course I would.
And I'm trying to be grateful for those two seconds, but I can't.<eos> I just hate this disease.<eos> I hate it that it took our friend.<eos> I hate it that I'm going to twice as many meetings, and they don't seem to help.<eos> I don't... even see the point anymore.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's it.<eos> Why are we clapping?<eos> Who else would like to share?<eos> I would.
And the Messengers destroy the world.<eos> - No, please. - Oh.<eos> Hey.<eos> - He can lead us to The Witness. - No.<eos> Please.<eos> The Witness...<eos> He lied to you.<eos> No.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> He wouldn't.
I ran.<eos> I'm the only one who can get here this quickly.<eos> But I saw you... getting off from a car.<eos> Did you?<eos> Why did you ask, then?<eos> I wanted to hear your joke.<eos> You look good in your dress uniform.<eos> I don't think it's proper for me to say that... to a person who just received disciplinary measures in it, though.<eos> How did you know this was... a dress uniform?<eos> Why wouldn't I?
And thank you for letting me do this here.<eos> It seemed like you didn't want to answer our questions in front of your husband.<eos> Can you blame me?<eos> Grace's book is about me.<eos> I told her about my flings because I felt bad for her.<eos> They were the only sex life she had.<eos> Only?<eos> You mean Andy couldn't?<eos> Worse.<eos> Wouldn't.
I hired Nurse Hoffel to make my job easier... i.e. showing me how to run a hospital... and now, this pill-popping battle axe thinks she's invaluable.<eos> An expenditure like that should really be run past the board of directors.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> The good news is that we were busy.<eos> So many patients to meet.<eos> Well, my name's Marguerite Honeywell.<eos> I suffer from Marfan Syndrome.<eos> Wow. That name is really kind of a mouthful.<eos> Do you mind if I called you "Marfan"?<eos> Um... yes, actually, I would.
Her husband agree to organ donation?<eos> Not yet.<eos> He said anything?<eos> Just sits there.<eos> Hey, Father.<eos> No, no, she hasn't decided yet.<eos> As soon as she does, I'll... I'll call you, okay?<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> Helping Natalie with the baptism. Uh-huh. She wants you to do that?<eos> Course. Why wouldn't she?
You snatched the letter.<eos> No way.<eos> Why would I snatch his letter?<eos> You took the letter showed it off in the classroom.<eos> Everybody laughed about it.<eos> What happened next?<eos> Where's the letter now then?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> Why would I?
Um, what's sex-positive, again?<eos> All sex is good sex as long as it's consensual.<eos> Like me fucking you.<eos> You're relentless.<eos> If we had clear boundaries, and I knew that you weren't assuming that just because I'm the trans guy,<eos> I get fucked...<eos> I'd consider it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay, then...<eos> I would, too.
You don't want to catch Peter Lewis?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Brian was just a test case.<eos> He'll do this again.<eos> We have the same list.<eos> We're contacting everybody on it.<eos> But you're right.<eos> He will try to do this again.<eos> If you want to help catch him...<eos> Yeah, I would.
I'm gonna try, Mrs. Gardner.<eos> I'm gonna give it... everything that I've got.<eos> I've had such a wonderful life.<eos> I just didn't know I was done teaching.<eos> Hello, Doctor.<eos> I know what you're gonna say.<eos> You don't use paper or books or office supplies, but this is how I work.<eos> I can't change everything overnight.<eos> I was just heading to the break room, and I was gonna ask if you wanted me to pick you up a cup of coffee.<eos> Yes, I would.
So, wait, you're going to meetings to deal with me?<eos> I go to meetings to deal with a lot of stuff.<eos> But, yeah, mostly you.<eos> How long has this been going on?<eos> Not long.<eos> Two years.<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> 'Cause I'm going to an Al-Anon meeting.<eos> You want to come?<eos> - No, I would not.
Here you go.<eos> You got a key?<eos> No.<eos> I don't go in there.<eos> He likes his privacy.<eos> Boys and their boy antics.<eos> What a tragic ending.<eos> But I don't believe for a second he's capable of murder.<eos> I can't imagine why anyone he went to school with would want to kill him.<eos> Or why anyone would at all, for that matter.
I just canceled the night.<eos> Manny, maybe you could help out here.<eos> Mom's upset because Joe won't go to sleep and I won't go back to a party.<eos> You won't go back to a party?<eos> Why?<eos> I suffered an unfortunate series of embarrassing incidents.<eos> I just want a wine bath and to go to sleep.<eos> Listen up, Manny.<eos> Of course you want to run away from whatever happened back that party.<eos> Anybody would.
We have Kaminen's hidden report, but we don't understand a word of it.<eos> And someone from the FSB digging around on the other side of the border.<eos> -I don't like the idea.<eos> -What idea?<eos> If you're thinking of Lena Jaakkola.<eos> When Heikkinen came by, it felt like we were back in Helsinki.<eos> Dad said you're applying for a job here, so you don't really want to go back.<eos> Since you're so smart, can you tell me where your dad was last night?<eos> -Do you really want to know?<eos> -Of course, why wouldn't I?
Right, so they take the regenerative cells in the nose and suspend them in a hydrogel, creating like a liquid scaffolding, which fills in the injured parts of the spine.<eos> Scientists did it to this guy who'd been paralyzed from the chest down, and check it out.<eos> That's incredible.<eos> Can we do it?<eos> We can definitely try.<eos> That was a knife injury though, right?<eos> Spinal cord was cleanly severed.<eos> This is different.<eos> I mean, we won't know for sure how Billy's injury would respond.<eos> - Or if it would at all.
Hello again.<eos> Hi.<eos> Look, I feel like I owe you an apology.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I do, because I haven't been able to stop thinking about what you said and how it applied to my own life.<eos> You spoke so beautifully and from your heart to someone who didn't come to listen.<eos> Words aren't usually my strong suit.<eos> Would you like to grab a bite?<eos> Hell, yes, he would.
But we were talking, and she didn't seem that excited.<eos> She wasn't into it?<eos> She was like, "Let's go to Costco with everyone."<eos> Oh, she changed topics?<eos> Yeah, she threw in "everyone."<eos> If she's not into it, then I'm...<eos> Well, I don't know, but if she's not interested, she would say so.<eos> -She would?<eos> That's true.<eos> -She would.
We'll need a lawyer too, and an adult advocate.<eos> For each of us.<eos> So the magic tablet is like the talisman?<eos> I know... freaky.<eos> Felix...<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I was an idiot to trust Alice.<eos> No, no, I get it.<eos> You wanted to walk again.<eos> - Who wouldn't?
Yeah.<eos> I believe that the administration could do better...<eos> - You worked for Underwood.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> I won't be offended.<eos> Uh, I like a lot about what she has to say.<eos> Would you vote for her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I might.<eos> Yeah. Probably would.
I would do anything for the woman that i love...<eos> Even get a drink with louis litt.<eos> You here to talk about anderton software?<eos> Because your 24-hour liberty rail pass is up.<eos> Then i guess it's a good thing That just came in the mail for me.<eos> What is it?<eos> Maintenance records showing<eos> They replaced the heat sensors on all of their trains Within six weeks after the derailment.<eos> Now, why would they do that if they never failed a safety test?<eos> They wouldn't.
So my own debts, in addition to the mortgage on Nampara?<eos> Around £900.<eos> More than I feared.<eos> You have assets.<eos> My shares in Wheal Leisure.<eos> I was approached only yesterday by a man named Cole, with a good offer.<eos> One that could clear all your debts.<eos> For all my shares?<eos> I got the impression he'd go even higher.<eos> Oh, he would.
You know, normal stuff millennials do.<eos> Not all millennials do that.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> I read it on a blog.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Are you happy to hang out, or do you want to go on a date?<eos> (Laughs):<eos> No! I don't want to go on a date.<eos> No. I wouldn't... yes.
I knew that if she's hurt by that, then she's still a girl, and she's still my little girl.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> We're gonna find her, all right?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I made this for you, Charlie.<eos> For me? (Laughs) Wow, wow. That makes me know you love me like I love you.<eos> - Emma.<eos> - I'd love to help you.<eos> - Yes, you would.
He wanted a haircut, and I stabbed him with the scissors.<eos> In the back.<eos> Boy, she makes us look like the gang that can't shoot straight, doesn't she?<eos> Our beautician.<eos> It's worth mentionin', you know, in the spirit of full disclosure... uh, my plan-- it worked.<eos> I made a deal for Dodd.<eos> With what?<eos> The Gerhardts?<eos> No.<eos> They-- they-- they wouldn't.
Why do you need me?<eos> Well, it's our understanding that you blamed Owen for the death of your son.<eos> I do, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> Can I ask why?<eos> Look, Tom knew what he was doing.<eos> So it stands to reason the equipment wasn't right.<eos> He'd watched me do it since he was a kid.<eos> Then why did the company say that the check had been done?<eos> (Sighs) They would, wouldn't they?
The only thing you ever treated with respect had a label and the word "proof" on it.<eos> Wait.<eos> - Is this that doctor from the other day?<eos> What's the scam?<eos> What kind of a man you think I am?<eos> There's always a scam, Frank.<eos> All right, yes, I'm very good at sticking it to the man.<eos> But this woman, I don't wanna stick anything to her, except myself.<eos> She won't let me. Why would anybody wanna be with you?<eos> Well, why wouldn't they?
~ Letting yourself get led by the nose...<eos> ~ OK, stop!<eos> ~ What's going on?<eos> ~ Why move a body if you don't have to?<eos> To conceal or to remove the evidence.<eos> Or... to provide an alibi!<eos> The car keys, did we find them?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> ~ It was important, you would've told me.<eos> ~ Of course I would.
Hey!<eos> Get on with it.<eos> An eye-witness at the wedding further stated that a Grimm was present, and I will shortly call forth that witness.<eos> Hey, Jessie.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - Hey.<eos> I still feel pretty bad about messing up.<eos> You know, that guy getting taken?<eos> Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.<eos> I would too.
I'm so glad you guys are getting along.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> - To be honest, Dre,<eos> I never thought you would get past the fact that Lance and Bow were engaged.<eos> Well, it... it...<eos> That's... it was...<eos> Uh, uh, no, no, no.<eos> Wait. Did you just say "engaged"?<eos> Well, I mean... [laughing] Come on.<eos> I wouldn't...
Digital forensics found an email chain between Robin and a potential buyer for her car.<eos> She arranged to meet them at 7:00 P.M. last night.<eos> Okay, well, the email suggests a premeditated abduction.<eos> Yeah, but taking the knife from her apartment suggests spontaneity.<eos> So does the sloppy crime scene.<eos> Property manager said she was late on her rent and she was gonna sell her car, so, Vega, you check into her financials,<eos> I'll look into her phone records.<eos> Nothing for me?<eos> Do you have time?<eos> Why wouldn't I?
Very few people campaign for someone who just fired them.<eos> He tell you that?<eos> He said he betrayed you.<eos> Three days later, you change your hair back to blonde and resign so you can, quote, "devote yourself to the campaign."<eos> I did the math.<eos> You and Francis, you've....<eos> We've what?<eos> He's shared a lot.<eos> Does that bother you?<eos> Why would it?
What happened?<eos> Maybe you didn't hear me, but I found Butt Massage Girl.<eos> Dude, she's amazing.<eos> We're kind of in love.<eos> Hey, I know you.<eos> You're Backflip Microphone Guy.<eos> We've been watching your video all day.<eos> You showed her that?<eos> Well, I mean, it's a good video.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
I hate it.<eos> Sitting around some restaurant I don't want to be at talking about other people's shit?<eos> No.<eos> So I should just ignore it?<eos> Yeah, it's one of the perks of being the driver.<eos> People don't expect you to text back.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - I would expect a text back.<eos> - I would also.
Ever since... when Raff was 12 and his science teacher said,<eos> "You know this lad could get in at a university,"<eos> ~ me dad's had this dream of seeing him go.<eos> ~ I'm just saying.<eos> And, think about it, if we let him pay for a big do, we could spend a bit more on the honeymoon, we could go somewhere really exotic.<eos> We don't need a big do, we don't know that many people!<eos> I thought you wanted a hog roast up at Sportsman's.<eos> Only cos we don't have silly money to chuck around!<eos> If we did, I'd splash out a bit more.<eos> ~ Would you?
We know you planted the bomb at the coffee shop because you wanted to be a hero, but you had nothing to do with the one at your house last night. Who did?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> A partner?<eos> No, I worked alone.<eos> He's lying.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Why would you plant a bomb that would put your wife and child at risk?<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> So you either had a partner or-- you had nothing to do with the blast at the school.<eos> You wouldn't.
And there's nothing wrong with that, but maybe you see my point.<eos> Believe what you want.<eos> I don't give a rat's ass.<eos> All I know is Carlo is the one who got to her.<eos> He knew exactly how to do it.<eos> With drugs?<eos> Carlo's the one who put Ava up to stealing the Caddy.<eos> I know it.<eos> He's the one who wanted to sell it.<eos> I wouldn't...
Like... do you know anything about women?<eos> These come up.<eos> These come up. What does?<eos> The bed.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> This?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The "up" button.<eos> Would you do that?<eos> Would you...
These come up. What does?<eos> The bed.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> This?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The "up" button.<eos> Would you do that?<eos> Would you...<eos> Oh, in a heartbeat.<eos> Oh, yeah. You would?
- Jane Rizzoli.<eos> - Nate Burns.<eos> I see you got a body in a fridge.<eos> I see you're reading our files.<eos> May I ask who called you here?<eos> Technically, it was me.<eos> Well, when Dr. Isles ran your victim's prints, it alerted us.<eos> The victim's on an international criminal database, so we've been after him for a while.<eos> - Great. - Name's Yuri Yevtushok, though he has a lot of aliases.<eos> I would, too.
You stay put.<eos> May I see the photograph, Inspector?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Eric, you stay here!<eos> You needn't worry.<eos> He'll be back.<eos> We don't need you to reassure us about our son, Inspector.<eos> Would you like to see the photograph of the girl, Mrs Birling?<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't.
I won't let you go!<eos> Don't go!<eos> Kyuuta!<eos> Kyuuta!<eos> Were you able to resolve things?<eos> I guess not...<eos> Doesn't matter anymore.<eos> I'm going to meet my dad now, and everything will be fine.<eos> Aren't you overdoing it?<eos> Why would I?
- Oh, it's a little cradle cap.<eos> - Oh. - Yeah.<eos> Cradle cap. Nothing to worry about.<eos> It should clear up in a week or two with baby shampoo and warm water, but not too warm, Daddy.<eos> Don't make it too warm.<eos> Hey. There you are.<eos> Isn't this a cute baby?<eos> You know who'd love to pinch this little guy's cheeks?<eos> Pearl.<eos> Yes, she would. Yes, she would. Oh...
But it looks like someone did.<eos> Castle, boost me up.<eos> Why am I always on the bottom?<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> Planets dank access ways... is it just me, or does this remind you of "Alien"?<eos> I know that you want this to be science-fiction, but we are not in space.<eos> No, but wouldn't you like it to be?<eos> Come on, you're a Sci-Fi geek.<eos> - Wouldn't you just love to go to Mars?<eos> - Of course I would.
That's it!<eos> We're coming round, and do not move!<eos> No, I'm fine!<eos> Oh...oh. ~ Oh. ~ Oh, my goodness!<eos> I'm fine. No panic. I am perfectly fine.<eos> All right.<eos> Ah. Ow. ~ Ah.<eos> How could I go to Paris?<eos> You wouldn't survive a week.<eos> No, I very probably wouldn't.
~ But you are Stevie's biggest fan.<eos> And his lover, briefly, before he broke your heart.<eos> Vince?<eos> You strike me as being a very patient man, biding your time, waiting for Stevie to return, the man who burned down your studio and ruined you.<eos> I couldn't kill Stevie.<eos> I couldn't kill anyone.<eos> And Disco Biscuit.<eos> I'd prefer it if you call me Duncan.<eos> ~ Why would you want to kill Stevie?<eos> ~ I wouldn't.
Which is why we must find the Major.<eos> He and I had a rather significant falling out, and I can't locate him, which is why you need to put me in a room with the Malaysian Deputy Minister to the U.N.<eos> You want the FBI to invite a U.N. diplomat<eos> - to meet with you?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> Inviting him for a chat with one of your most wanted criminals would be ludicrous.<eos> You'll need to abduct him.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Why on earth would...
I am motivated circumstances, created by others.<eos> Your team is waiting in the basement.<eos> I charge you to go and find Arnesen.<eos> Hello.<eos> Glad to have you join. I was obliged to stop you Oscar.<eos> I was afraid that something will happen.<eos> You must leave the resistance movement adults.<eos> It is dangerous.<eos> - Thomas would not like it.<eos> - Yes, it would ...
50 quid is 50 quid, mate.<eos> 50 quid is what we were short of when we bought this place.<eos> Our friend Terry Miller lent it us in the end.<eos> If he hadn't have...<eos> He brought the cash round in pound notes, as I remember.<eos> God, yeah.<eos> I'd forgotten that.<eos> Right, Liv, let's see if we can find some choccy biccies.<eos> Anyone want another cuppa?<eos> Grandpa would!
You sing like an angel.<eos> So you came here with a purpose? Yes.<eos> What purpose?<eos> I'm thinking about buying a car.<eos> I don't do that anymore.<eos> When the feds shuttered hasty's place I ran away.<eos> From paradise?<eos> From you.<eos> You miss me?<eos> No more than I would my eyes.
I can.<eos> Child, I could kill you 100 ways.<eos> I will not lie.<eos> Others have urged me to do just that.<eos> And I am fully prepared to cut your candle short.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Merely to help you be you.<eos> I know you find it hard to believe, but I hold no malice against you.<eos> And yet you would kill me 100 ways.<eos> As I would a savage untrained dog.
Too much beer and bratwurst, probably.<eos> That should get him moving again.<eos> Now, I really do think we ought to put the cadaver back where we found it.<eos> Cadaver?<eos> He was a human being, you know?<eos> Sorry?<eos> He had a family.<eos> He's not a piece of meat.<eos> Ah, yes, of course... Would anyone like to say a few words?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Detective Flynn came to me with her theory about Janet Wong's involvement in the Derek Caster murder.<eos> I felt like the theory had merit, so I greenlit the investigation.<eos> You've known Detective Flynn a long time.<eos> We were partners back in the day.<eos> You're loyal to her and she's loyal to you.<eos> I believe I have the support of my whole team.<eos> But you had a personal relationship with Detective Flynn, correct?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> So, you wouldn't say she enjoys special consideration, even, uh, unintentionally?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
So what time is he picking us up?<eos> Like 10 minutes ago.<eos> Hurry up, we're late.<eos> It's Kate.<eos> She's back in town.<eos> I hate lying.<eos> You would hate it more if we missed this 4for1 concert.<eos> True.<eos> And Bobby is hot, so you know he has cute friends.<eos> He'd better.
Yes, thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Do you post your own letters? - Ha!<eos> It was vital it went off today and I'm never very good at delegating.<eos> As a matter of fact, I'm glad to see you.<eos> I'd value your advice.<eos> I've had a letter from the Royal Yorkshire Hospital, asking if I'd head the new Board of Charitable Donors.<eos> We'd be working alongside.<eos> Well, that's if I stay the almoner, once we've amalgamated.<eos> Of course you would.
It's not right for you to talk to Mr. Alzate that way.<eos> He's a great man, and he deserves our respect.<eos> I'm the one not getting any respect around here, Kyle.<eos> Maybe it's hard for people to respect you when the only reason you got this job is because of your dad.<eos> Oh, uh, and by the way, Applebee's might be calling you for a reference.<eos> I trust you'll be professional.<eos> Did you like the leftover venison I put in your omelet?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Would you go so far as to say it was deer-licious?<eos> No, I-I wouldn't.
I hate you.<eos> You're nothing.<eos> You're worthless.<eos> Think about it, Bill.<eos> Think about what?<eos> If you died, would anyone care?<eos> Would they really care?<eos> Yeah, maybe they'd cry for a day, but let's be honest.<eos> No one would give a shit.<eos> They wouldn't.
Can I organise someone, to take you to father's grave?<eos> No, I can make my own way, George, thank you.<eos> Why is James not here?<eos> He and Olivia had an argument.<eos> Now, I didn't pry and I trust you won't either.<eos> I should tell you, I've withdrawn from pre-selection.<eos> Please mother, spare me the lecture, to queen and country.<eos> George, what possible reason..?<eos> Has this to do with Sarah?<eos> Why on earth would it?
Hey, Toby.<eos> I'm Tiny Rick.<eos> I'm new.<eos> Hey oh - - Go easy on me.<eos> Ha ha.<eos> Just kiddin'.<eos> Hey, I like your straightforward style and that lab coat's pretty cool.<eos> Summer.<eos> He knows my name!<eos> Why wouldn't he?
It's real.<eos> The Darkness... It's been locked away since the dawn of creation.<eos> And now it's free.<eos> Whatever's wrong, Dean will fix it.<eos> God help us.<eos> I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who would?
Keep going!<eos> Where's Galega?<eos> She's sleeping.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Don't pour it on me!<eos> - Just a bit.<eos> - Have you ever eaten cattle feed?<eos> - No!<eos> - Want to see me do it?<eos> - You would?
Today is his daughters' graduation;<eos> I have given him the day off.<eos> You have to see the rack of lamb, just beautiful!<eos> Heitor loves lamb.<eos> Hi, Heitor. Have you arrived?<eos> I will open the gate.<eos> What is happening, Elias?<eos> Open the gate.<eos> Heitor, I'm glad you came!<eos> Of course I would.
Provokes desire, but inhhibits execution.<eos> It hoists the dick but straight after makes him sleep.<eos> Excuse me asking, Mr. Angenor.<eos> How come you have such an eloquent speech?<eos> Let's say I have spent some time in reclusion, against my will, and concentrated on books.<eos> Mr. Elias asked to get a document, but left his drawer locked.<eos> Sir, because you are my friend, and found me on the booze, I will help you.<eos> This is the best drawer opener ever manufactured... by myself.<eos> Who would ever think, an ex robber would be working in a bank one day.<eos> Who would...
That's right.<eos> May of 1998.<eos> Is it possible?<eos> What?<eos> Is what possible?<eos> General Silva had a son.<eos> Born in February 1998.<eos> Nine months after the Posta massacre.<eos> That would make him roughly the same age as Gabriel.<eos> It would.
Well, you were brewing.<eos> I was bored, and...<eos> Wow, you sure you want me to go out with a girl who lists sex as an interest?<eos> At least she didn't list it as an occupation, right?<eos> Look, she's hot, she's different, and she's getting her master's degree.<eos> She looks familiar.<eos> Oh, no. I'm not going out with someone you already slept with.<eos> No, from something else.<eos> Definitely didn't sleep with her.<eos> Not that I wouldn't.
All right.<eos> Got it.<eos> Doesn't look too damaged. All right.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll send the data from the black box, along with everything from the car's computer.<eos> Wait.<eos> If I'm analyzing the black box and the CAN-Bus, what are you guys gonna do?<eos> We're going to Disneyland.<eos> You don't think they're really gonna go, do you?<eos> I would.
- Can you breach it?<eos> - Breach it?<eos> By the time you get inside, they'd have moved on the hostages.<eos> - You need a static Simon.<eos> - A breach grenade?<eos> I mean, that's a military-grade weapon.<eos> We don't have time to requisition one.<eos> What if we had one?<eos> You guys are in the country, gathering intelligence.<eos> Why would...
What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Say it.<eos> It's about that boy.<eos> I told you I'm not sleeping with him.<eos> I know.<eos> It's not that.<eos> He's the one you're protecting, right?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> I wouldn't either.
But your father and I talked about it, and the next time there is a sleepover... you can go.<eos> For real?<eos> Yes.<eos> When the time comes, we can talk about...<eos> I have an open invite at Dave's!<eos> I will go tonight.<eos> No.<eos> I don't trust Dave.<eos> His own father doesn't want to sleep there.<eos> Why would you?
- Any word from Dmitri?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't know how long he stayed in Moscow after he contacted us.<eos> Did he feel like he'd been compromised?<eos> He didn't say anything, but it could be the reason that he wanted out.<eos> That would be unfortunate.<eos> Has the president seen the battle plan report from Doroshevich?<eos> The president?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, why would he?
She whispers that she wants to go.<eos> "I wanna go to Blue note."<eos> It's amazing she could do such a thing.<eos> She must really want to go.<eos> That must be the reason.<eos> -She really wants to go to Blue Note.<eos> -She does.<eos> But in that situation, guys would think, "She wants to go with me."<eos> We would.<eos> -They would.
Can I ask what's your type?<eos> Someone who can survive on a deserted island.<eos> A deserted island?<eos> -A deserted island?<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> Someone I can rely on.<eos> Oh, if the two of you were on a deserted island?<eos> Yes, even if the environment changes...<eos> -Someone you can rely on.<eos> -...that person wouldn't.
All right.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where you headed?<eos> Washington.<eos> I caught a case.<eos> You want me to come with?<eos> Do you want to come?<eos> On a hunt?<eos> Why wouldn't I?
I don't want anything.<eos> The only thing I want is to go home.<eos> What's my name?<eos> What?<eos> - What's my name?<eos> How should I know?<eos> - I think you know.<eos> He told you, didn't he? - No.<eos> No.<eos> Why would he?
But then I said, "Rock, "that sounds lovely, but I'm afraid I have to be up early to prep "and pack for my home visits."<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> I blame Christmas and the long winter nights.<eos> Number of young women due to give birth nine months later.<eos> There's 30 in the next two weeks alone!<eos> And my district patient numbers are spiralling wildly.<eos> I don't know how we're going to get through the next month.<eos> Unless we start home visits an hour earlier.<eos> No, he really wouldn't want me to do that.<eos> Who wouldn't?
James, when you're up to socialising again I must show you both some hospitality.<eos> Well, it might be some time before we're back in the city.<eos> When you are.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> And for being so kind to Livvy while I was unwell.<eos> She's fine company.<eos> Perhaps you could join us.<eos> We'd love to.<eos> Wouldn't we?<eos> We would.
Bradshaw chairs the committee.<eos> He can withdraw the proposal.<eos> If you want the satellite to go away,<eos> Bradshaw's the one you go after.<eos> So, why bring this to Cybercom?<eos> The senator didn't bring it to Cybercom.<eos> He didn't bring it to anyone.<eos> The senator and his wife watched the video together, and afterwards, he went to the Capitol building as if nothing had happened.<eos> They don't know that you have the video. Mnh-mnh. Would you care to explain why it is that you're in possession of it?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Dad!<eos> You've made a terrible mistake.<eos> That is not my mother!<eos> Settle down, Burt.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> I was doing this for your mother.<eos> I don't see how lip-wrestling with the editor of Casserole Today could be for her.<eos> See, I throw the judges a little sugar so your mother wins.<eos> I think she'd prefer you kept your sugar to yourself.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
I'm on eight right now, and I'm high as a kite.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Um, so, listen, I'm kinda homeless right now.<eos> So does anyone have a place where I could crash for a few days?<eos> Like maybe Tori?<eos> Hey, Threepeat, how you doing?<eos> I know you wanted that Hong Kong office pretty bad.<eos> You know, it's okay.<eos> I mean, would I really wanna leave my friends and family, move to a strange country, work seven days a week, and have absolutely no social life?<eos> Of course I would.
He's been laundering money for the dealers.<eos> Feds have been after him for years.<eos> - Didn't I tell you she was a drug dealer?<eos> - Enough.<eos> There is no way that Fernanda had anything to do with drugs.<eos> She's not like that.<eos> - Frankie, looks are often deceiving.<eos> - Yeah, no kidding.<eos> - [Whispering] You have time for lunch?<eos> - I absolutely would.
I gotta run.<eos> I don't want to risk the wrath of Dani by being late for date night. I hear you.<eos> I'm heading out, too.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Bye.<eos> - You told Emma about Hayley? - You're welcome.<eos> - What, you think you were doing me a favor?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Emma's really upset. Why would you want to hurt her like that?<eos> Why would you?
Is that... that's not a wig, is it?<eos> No, I, um...<eos> Thought I would just try and do this in stages.<eos> Anyway, I just wanted to...<eos> Welcome you to the neighborhood.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Yeah, I was gonna...<eos> I was gonna stop by your room when I checked in, but um...<eos> I didn't know if you'd want me to do that.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
That was fast.<eos> You have your way of dealing with reality, and I have mine.<eos> If you're gonna keep wearing that damn thing, I have two words for you.<eos> Dry cleaning.<eos> Pick two words I understand.<eos> "How strong is your daughter?<eos> Strong enough to fight for her soul?"<eos> Did you say those words to Captain Frank Irving?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I wouldn't.
- a chain gang knocking on your back door.<eos> - Bikers?<eos> - What the hell do they want?<eos> - I think they want us to pull over.<eos> - Obviously, you idiot!<eos> Why? !<eos> - Kidnapping!<eos> It's a kidnapping, it's a kidnapping to kidnap me, Cherlene!<eos> - Why would bikers want to kidnap you?<eos> - Why would anyone?
It's saying, 'I'm a very attractive woman.'<eos> But not conventional.<eos> She has more authority than that.<eos> And she has money.<eos> That's an expensive lipstick.<eos> It's not waxy, you see?<eos> Right.<eos> Would it hold up in court?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> But it would in my sewing circle.
[Gouby] I hate when they do that.<eos> [Lechenault] No security on!<eos> [man] Just gonna get close like that.<eos> [Gouby] So we speak English tonight.<eos> [man] No, Français!<eos> [man] My Français is a bit shit.<eos> What do you define yourself as?<eos> [John] Some people would say I'm a mercenary.<eos> [Gouby] You're a mercenary?<eos> [John] Some people would... some people wouldn't.
Richard thinks I'm in love with him.<eos> He would go to the end of the world for me.<eos> Who wouldn't?<eos> I did.<eos> I've had a little trouble securing the money.<eos> What?<eos> That's unacceptable.<eos> I completely agree.<eos> So you don't know where it is?<eos> Why would I?
Hey, sir.<eos> Hector.<eos> She's looking good.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I really like my work.<eos> I'm just sorry I won't be able to stay.<eos> Why not?<eos> My visa application was denied.<eos> I see. Do you want to stay?<eos> Of course, who wouldn't?
It's my fault she was out here.<eos> A stand-in is killed after only a few weeks on a film set.<eos> She's well liked, quiet. Why?<eos> She went to prison.<eos> Maybe it has to do with her past.<eos> Yes, if we could get a copy of Thea's criminal record... Yes.<eos> Oh, sir!<eos> No harm done.<eos> Would you like me to start interviewing?<eos> If you would, Fidel.
Say you took one of the files out.<eos> Is it still the file room?<eos> Pizza today, right?<eos> In the cafeteria?<eos> Or is it meat loaf?<eos> No, I'm saying that you and I both agree that the file room minus one file is still the file room.<eos> Now, say you took another one out and then another.<eos> If the file room minus one file is still a file room, and you keep subtracting one at a time, you could end up with zero files--<eos> I'm saying, logically-- or even negative files,<eos> - and it would still--
He lives in San Diego.<eos> We go to Comic Con together.<eos> It's all very normal.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Because none of this seems normal to me.<eos> You know, I have the best of both worlds, uh, being a father and an Agent.<eos> But why couldn't you tell me?<eos> Because you would have wanted to meet him.<eos> Hells yeah I would.
She'll fit right in.<eos> If anyone asks you where the baby came from, you found her at the castle door.<eos> That's all you know.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - Of course.<eos> I'll say nothing. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh... Did you see the baby's foot?<eos> It's a mark that pagans sometimes put on their newborns, to distinguish the baby in the eyes of their gods.<eos> Isabel must have put it there.<eos> Who knows of this tradition?<eos> Any pagan would.
That how you know?<eos> Your little boyfriend is out of the country, so let's take this as an opportunity to show you where it get real.<eos> See what I'm doing with my people in my hood.<eos> Bring your Armani asses to Compton, we'll settle this shit once and for all in my house.<eos> Um, but your house is in Beverly Hills.<eos> Man, shut the fuck up, Doug!<eos> Hey, man, cut that part out, man.<eos> Since the idea of coming to Compton got your ass all shook up, man...<eos> No, no, no, Lukas, we would love to see what you are up to in the neighborhood.<eos> We-We would?

Life changes us.<eos> There is... research proving the elasticity of the brain.<eos> You want to start over?<eos> Very much.<eos> - Go outside.<eos> - Outside your house?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I like this plan.<eos> - Okay, what's going on?<eos> - Would you...
I have to be.<eos> What's the last thing you remember? Um... I was at the mixer.<eos> Uh, and then I remember running into y'all at the creek.<eos> Everything between is just... it's gone.<eos> It's not gone, it's just locked away.<eos> And I'm here to help you bring it back.<eos> But look at me.<eos> Would you wanna know how this happened to you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
I do, but is everyone we need still on the train?<eos> - Hell yes.<eos> - Even Judge Harris?<eos> We heard he missed a few days of work last week.<eos> Didn't tell anybody.<eos> Heard how they found him yesterday too.<eos> The man's son shot himself in the head.<eos> If he had a few bad days, I think he gets a pass.<eos> Of course he does.<eos> Any man would.
Let me put it a different way.<eos> You're doing a dangerous thing.<eos> If you think you can get what you want from me and then hurt her or her family, I will probably figure that out.<eos> And then you'll feel a whole lot different.<eos> It's hard to think in these circles.<eos> To trust each other when, really, we can't.<eos> We've fallen into something together.<eos> Okay, I pushed us into that, but I have no interest in anyone getting hurt.<eos> Not you, me, her, some grandmother of hers.<eos> Why would I?
We, um recently heard him speak at a social event.<eos> Oh, God, he's a drunk?<eos> - He's not a drunk.<eos> - Anymore.<eos> - And he's free.<eos> - Anyway, he says that you have to get Luke to sign his rights away before the adoption can go forward.<eos> How could I do that?<eos> Luke's dead-set against it.<eos> Hmm. Would you mind if I talked to him?<eos> Yes, I would.
Uh-huh. Well, she got a point, right?<eos> I can live with that.<eos> What?<eos> Brother, I thought you were shot.<eos> I was.<eos> In my thigh.<eos> Thigh?<eos> That don't count.<eos> For you?<eos> No, for you, it would not.
He won't bite or bark or destroy your hotel.<eos> Of course.<eos> Now, you were saying about those drink vouchers?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Here are, uh, two... - um... - Four... all of my drink vouchers for the oasis lounge.<eos> And again, on behalf of myself and the harbor inn and everybody at Pacific Coast Properties LLC, thank you so much for your understanding.<eos> Bye, now.<eos> Sure we're getting the most out of this?<eos> I feel like the kids might enjoy a dessert cart.<eos> Ooh, yes, they would.
Bhutan.<eos> - Oh, why do I even try?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's the gun, a Pindad PS-01.<eos> That is an armor-piercing bullet.<eos> I mean, even I couldn't get my hands<eos> - on one of those if I wanted to. - Well, ballistics guys say that there's not a gun store within a thousand miles that would carry anything for this.<eos> Why does a prostitute need heavy ammo?<eos> She wouldn't.
A few friends.<eos> Or we could go out.<eos> For a meal.<eos> Just a few of us.<eos> Somewhere nice.<eos> I can't believe I wasn't at Kirsten's funeral.<eos> Catherine, you were poorly.<eos> You couldn't stand up.<eos> She'd be wondering why I wasn't there.<eos> Who would?
- I'm sorry?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I was foolish and I returned to this country as penance.<eos> Since being at Selborne Hall... I've had the good fortune to see what a true family is, what it is to have children who look up to you, parents who would do anything for you, and a spouse who makes you a better person.<eos> I can't sing, Mr Tipping, or paint or cook, but I can recognise good music, good art and good food without possessing any of those skills.<eos> So why not moral character, too, despite allegedly having none myself, as you so chivalrously put it?<eos> No further questions.<eos> She's put us back in this!<eos> And yet, despite a clear financial gain to your own business, you would still prefer Upton not to have a zoo?<eos> I would.
But then, unfortunately, I had to take a call...<eos> Work related? The call.<eos> Was the call...<eos> No, it was my daughter, as a matter of fact.<eos> So we've met and now we're here and I'm looking forward to talking.<eos> As I understand it, you're our last best hope for the network to stay on the air.<eos> If I was a man with no choices, I'd kill myself.<eos> Well, I guess that means I have a choice, so...<eos> Would you like to talk about my intentions for the network?<eos> Yes, sir, I would.
You mean because it takes you out of town?<eos> After three years, we started dating three days ago.<eos> No.<eos> The answer is no.<eos> You shouldn't care.<eos> Right.<eos> What are you smiling about?<eos> This is the stuff that drove Charlie out of his mind.<eos> He'd appreciate that we're still doing it at his funeral.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
Let me set the scene.<eos> It's your office, it's late at night, you're at your desk and you're doing admin.<eos> I appear at the door in my little briefs.<eos> I'm rock-hard and ready for action, and it's twitching away like a meerkat on guard.<eos> You look up, you take in my member, and you look down again.<eos> I wipe my feet, I move over to the desk, I lean in and attempt to take that tabard off.<eos> You pull back, twist round, and continue with admin.<eos> What?<eos> So, even...<eos> Even in your dream, I still would...
- In theory.<eos> Well, in theory, I'm having a party tonight.<eos> My address is on the card.<eos> So, if you're intrigued by the wild, weird, and wonderful...<eos> Okay, can't guarantee the "wonderful." But the others...<eos> Oh, good Lord God.<eos> Anyway, you'd be more than welcome.<eos> Why would you invite me to your home?<eos> You want me to be honest?<eos> I would, yes.
When he had his hands on you, he had his hands on England.<eos> So he's decided to wed me, then keep all three crowns for himself.<eos> Thus his suddenly generous acceptance of the fact that you are not pregnant... yet.<eos> He wants to give you an heir himself.<eos> And the spectacle, the carnage...<eos> - Botched display of his prowess.<eos> - Does he honestly think that Francis and I would agree to have our marriage annulled?<eos> It's ridiculous!<eos> No.<eos> Even he wouldn't.
Eat a proper breakfast and lunch.<eos> There won't be time for more than a cup of tea later.<eos> I'll try to make it up.<eos> When you've finished your duties, I'd appreciate any help you can give.<eos> We'll clear the hall now.<eos> But why aren't we giving a proper dinner here?<eos> I quite agree, Mrs Patmore.<eos> Mrs Hughes would say we must move with the times.<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
Hildy, someone here to see you.<eos> Found him in the lobby.<eos> You're up early.<eos> I learned some information late last night about the death of my father.<eos> I felt I should come in first thing.<eos> Mm. You beat us to it.<eos> We were, uh, just gonna come see you.<eos> Would you mind following us?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Yeah, well, why would Salter and Wilkerson
I need an outside line.<eos> Indiana.<eos> Is that Chanel No. 5?<eos> I thought they stopped shipping that?<eos> Oh, my mother planned ahead.<eos> Emptied the pantry and filled it with bottles.<eos> The Nazi flag is flying over Paris and the thing she fears most is running out of perfume.<eos> How's that sweetheart of yours?<eos> Can't complain.<eos> Pretty thing like her, I wouldn't either.
Eugene, why did-- Eugene?<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> - Um... - Answer me.<eos> I appreciate the positive affirmations and looking the other way on the perversion, but I know empirically and definitively I cannot survive on my own.<eos> - I cannot.<eos> - So you killed the bus?<eos> If I don't cure the disease, if I don't save the world, I have no value.<eos> - That's not how it works.<eos> - If I don't fix things, there's no way you people would keep me around, share resources, even protect me.<eos> Of course we would.
The patrol brought in everyone they could find.<eos> What about the Ark?<eos> It came down last...<eos> We saw it.<eos> There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles.<eos> If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> I would, too.
Sounds like something that would be tough on a marriage.<eos> - Yeah, suddenly, I found myself - [Sniffles] Looking at wedding photos while he locked himself in that study.<eos> Did you know the code to get in?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, he's probably changed it a hundred times since then.<eos> He was paranoid about his work.<eos> And what was the project that he was involved in?<eos> He never told me, but he did let me know we were almost broke because of it.<eos> Oh, and, by the way, if anything should happen to him, that I wouldn't get the life-insurance money.<eos> The project would.
~ If this was murder, she knew her attacker. ~ Well, it's possible.<eos> Death would have been instantaneous.<eos> Heart failure, I'd say.<eos> Caused by what?<eos> Well, poison, maybe.<eos> What we have to consider here is the matter of intent.<eos> Thank you, Mr Jarvis.<eos> Doctors and vicars, the only professions where you're at everyone's beck and call, even when you're attempting to have a night off.<eos> You wouldn't have it any other way.<eos> Neither would you.
Because I've been in the future.<eos> The moon is still there...<eos> I think.<eos> You know the moon is still there, right?<eos> Maybe it isn't the moon.<eos> Maybe it's a hologram or a big painting.<eos> Or a special effect.<eos> Maybe it's a completely different moon.<eos> But you would know.<eos> I would?
I have to resolve this.<eos> I'm sick of running away from it.<eos> Do you know where he lives?<eos> I think it's best you just call him.<eos> Bird, you're telling someone you like them for the first time, but you really don't wanna tell them, and you also really don't wanna even like them in the first place, but you're also wondering if they like you, too.<eos> I'm not having that conversation over the phone.<eos> I just really think he wouldn't want you to go to his home.<eos> Why?<eos> Just trust me, okay?<eos> He wouldn't.
- Mmm. - Oh. But I think, she couldn't cut it in the States, so she hops across the pond and kisses the frogs.<eos> I want to taste you.<eos> Mmm, sweetheart.<eos> Why don't you fish out that bottle of sherry we've been saving, hmm?<eos> - You're burning up.<eos> - Am I?<eos> I'd like to know you better.<eos> Is that strange to say?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I would.
Trust me.<eos> There's hope for you.<eos> Mm...<eos> Hey.<eos> No way I'm gonna make it to spin class this morning, Steph.<eos> I was calling to tell you I'm not going.<eos> Yeah? What's your excuse?<eos> I got a breakfast date.<eos> And you want to guess with who?<eos> - I really wouldn't.
I was wondering if you could tell me what you meant?<eos> Being post mistress round here, next best thing to being vicar in terms of finding things out.<eos> Not that I've ever opened a single piece of mail.<eos> No, of course.<eos> I can't help noticing the sorts of things that pass between people.<eos> Sir Henry Coverly... All I'll say is, he gets a large number of letters, written in a particular female hand.<eos> A Wainsbury postmark. I see.<eos> Some of them are scented.<eos> Now, I know Lady Jane must see those letters and she must know what they are.<eos> Any woman would.
Also, not the modest mouse shirt!<eos> That's a special edition, too!<eos> Got it.<eos> Geez, he's like "The Great Gatsby" of t-shirts.<eos> Whoa, you know what this is, Dana?<eos> This is a big none of your business.<eos> Stop snooping.<eos> Except, I mean, this is probably a present for me, so future Dana technically already owns this, and she wouldn't mind if I take a peek.<eos> Would you, future Dana?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
What are you talking about?<eos> You don't expect me to pay sight unseen.<eos> Your associates already saw it.<eos> You're here to pay and go, my friend.<eos> Not until I see it for myself.<eos> Are you a cop, kitty cat?<eos> Is that what you are?<eos> Wouldn't tell you if I was, would I?<eos> No...<eos> You sure as fuck wouldn't.
You could never say it to me, and you still can't say it to her.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I can express feelings.<eos> Nothing on the outside.<eos> Nothing on the inside.<eos> Look, I got to bounce.<eos> Quick question, though.<eos> Would you see Cate Blanchett in a movie about Eva Braun?<eos> Why are you wasting my time with this?<eos> - Of course I would. Who wouldn't?
You gotta be sure, missus.<eos> Sure as I can be.<eos> Sun dance.<eos> Hurt, didn't it?<eos> Surely did.<eos> But you go through it...<eos> Because you have to.<eos> The house in Toronto, if there's anything you'd like to change...<eos> No.<eos> Why would I?
♪ Arrow 3x08 ♪ The Brave and the Bold Original Air Date on December 3, 2014<eos> What about this A.R.G.U.S. angle?<eos> Oh, well, A.R.G.U.S. wiped all evidence of their agent's death after he was killed, or at least they thought they did.<eos> Our boomerang victim, Kai Wu.<eos> The man's profile is so clean, I should have known it was an A.R.G.U.S. cover.<eos> Well, now that we know Wu is A.R.G.U.S., maybe Lyla can get us a lead?<eos> If this an A.R.G.U.S. thing, Lyla's going to want it to stay that way.<eos> Then tell her to stop letting people get killed in my city.<eos> You really don't care about my marriage, do you?<eos> Well, I would...
No.<eos> Oh, come on, the guy is guilty.<eos> Nobody thought otherwise until Castle over here started moonlighting for the mob.<eos> I think that might be overstating it a little.<eos> You took a blood oath.<eos> You let them turn you into an honorary mobster.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> RYAN: Come on, man. How many people outside of the mafia ever get to swear Omerta?<eos> I think it is an experience of a lifetime.<eos> Of course you would.
Thank you.<eos> Those are my questions.<eos> Dr. Ogden, tell us more about this "fugue state."<eos> It's a term coined by the French psychologist Pierre Janet to describe people who disassociate from their normal identity and take refuge in a new one.<eos> And is this a conscious decision?<eos> No.<eos> It's completely unconscious.<eos> In fact, the sufferer typically has no memory of the episode.<eos> So this would explain why Mary Thompson has no memory of the night her husband was murdered?<eos> - Yes, it would.
- Well, do you have a more compelling theory?<eos> Wainwright drugged Mrs. Thompson.<eos> He took her key.<eos> He then went and stabbed her husband to death.<eos> He returned to collect Mrs. Thompson.<eos> - ... Who was too drugged to know what was happening.<eos> - He brought Mrs. Thompson home, clasped her hand around the murder weapon, and then placed her in the room next door to her dead husband.<eos> Knowing she would still be there when he summoned a Constable the next day.<eos> It's a good theory, I would just like to hear what Mr. Wainwright has to say.<eos> Mm-hmm, as would I.
So, that's it.<eos> I left the restaurant.<eos> I walked out.<eos> Thing is, though, if I don't broach the subject with my dad, he will.<eos> And then what?<eos> Well, look, either he is or he isn't.<eos> And if he isn't, he'll just laugh, surely.<eos> And if he is, well... it's not going to come as a surprise to him, is it?<eos> He knows whether or not he had a fling.<eos> Yeah, but he just wouldn't.
Ah! He's grip... he's gripping me!<eos> Aw, he likes you. D'you know what we've called him?<eos> Justin Timberlake.<eos> No! What?<eos> Derek.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Baby Derek.<eos> We hope he turns out as brilliant as you.<eos> He'd better.
No way!<eos> Amazing , eh?<eos> Who was that?<eos> That was... someonewho'sdoubting the breakup was the right thing.<eos> It happens sometimes.<eos> Really?<eos> What do you say then?<eos> I convince them the breakup was absolutely right.<eos> And if Kati had called?<eos> Yeah , then I probably wouldn't.
- Does West know?<eos> - I haven't told him.<eos> But I'm sure he'll understand.<eos> So none of us are going to the prom?<eos> Maybe we could still go- the three of us.<eos> It could still be fun.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Like a trouple.<eos> We'd make a very cute trouple.<eos> We would.
What's so funny?<eos> So this week in Glee Club, it's ladies' choice, inspired by the Sadie Hawkins Dance.<eos> Which I thought of.<eos> It was my idea. Yes, thank you, Tina.<eos> And every girl will sing to whoever they want to take to the dance.<eos> Well, I, for one, love this lesson.<eos> I've got a song I want to sing to somebody.<eos> ♪ I can sing high and sing low ♪<eos> Kurt, he's still sleeping. ♪ Would you like some tea?<eos> ♪ Yes, I would, but shh.
He found her the night of the gala.<eos> And killed her after spending the night with me. (Scoffs)<eos> I know how to pick 'em, don't I?<eos> You know, I haven't even gone near a man in months, and the first guy I like turns out to be a murderer.<eos> - Maybe multiple murderer.<eos> - What?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Tatyana said that two other girls with the same mark have gone missing in the last two weeks.<eos> - They haven't turned up here.<eos> - No, they wouldn't.
You're sure lucky.<eos> I spend my time on these things.<eos> Mr. Kato!<eos> About Tachibana's part-time job...<eos> OZAKI, SHUNSUKE 1997, WITHDREW FROM WATO UNIVERSITY<eos> SHUNSUKE OZAKI + WATO UNIVERSITY<eos> SHUNSUKE OZAKI:<eos> OUTSTANDING PLAYER<eos> To put it bluntly, did you have a sexual relationship?<eos> Why would we?
There's a standard distance?<eos> Allowing for the distance from camera, the contestant occupies one half of the television screen while Verity occupied the other.<eos> So, I started out, just talking...<eos> That angle diminished over the course of James's five heats, culminating in our final appearance when Verity's position meant the camera had to move to include her.<eos> Now, on at least five occasions - at least five occasions during shooting - I witnessed conversations of increasing length between James and Verity when details of impending questions could have been discussed.<eos> Or perhaps there's more to it.<eos> Such as?<eos> £1,000 in cash!<eos> They were having an affair.<eos> Why would they?
You go this way. I'll go that way.<eos> Right.<eos> Hello!<eos> Chad?<eos> Anybody home?<eos> [squeaks] [laughs] Now, ain't this just perfection?<eos> I don't want to make you mad or anything, Murdoch, but that ain't the dog.<eos> I know, you idiot.<eos> It ain't even a little boy.<eos> - [muffled scream] - Would you-
Ah, same undercover operation where I wore this... briefly.<eos> Uh, yeah. How about this one?<eos> Oh, yeah, you guys weren't there for that.<eos> You know, I get why they want to free up space in the storage room, but... who's gonna want any of this old junk?<eos> I'm keeping the soul patch.<eos> What's that?<eos> I remember that case.<eos> That's the pregnancy pact.<eos> You looked good in that.<eos> I still would.
Walter and I like to go to children's hospital on the weekends and visit with the kids.<eos> So inspiring.<eos> We help out with their annual fund-raiser. Mm-hmm. Oh.<eos> You are that Dan and Darlene Meyer? - That's us.<eos> - Guilty.<eos> Oh. I have seen your names on the program.<eos> - Oh. - Yeah.<eos> You've gotta be kidding me.<eos> Well... who would like a piece of pie? - Thank you.<eos> Oh, I would.
Well thanks.<eos> I'm sure they're just a couple of chips right off the old block.<eos> Well let's hope, right now our mission is to find 'em, make Sure they're safe and, get them out of paris.<eos> Roger that major..<eos> Look, easy here.<eos> Here take my credit card.<eos> Cash only.<eos> Mona mi.<eos> We don't have that kinda cash.<eos> Who would?
- Awake!<eos> I'm going away.<eos> - I have no money.<eos> - You could work as a model.<eos> My resume is summarized this catalog.<eos> Mom who was wanted.<eos> Because it grew larger house drunk Finnskogen.<eos> Is ridiculous obsessed with my modeling career.<eos> - But you're very pretty.<eos> - But I would not.
I say we go to the mini-mall.<eos> Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend<eos> - so I can get the discount.<eos> - That's what I do.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off.<eos> Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. Why wouldn't I?
Right. How do you get flu?<eos> Somebody sneezes and you breathe it in.<eos> No. No, no.<eos> You ingest it.<eos> Mostly you get it on your hands and you ingest it.<eos> So, they adapt some fucking weapons-grade flu virus so it can be hidden in food, and Corvadt make a vaccine that's only effective on certain races.<eos> After Fetlar, people are terrified.<eos> One more outbreak like that and they'll be rioting to get it in their arms. Fuck testing!<eos> But you'd need it in so much food.<eos> Yeah, you would.
Something's not right.<eos> Regina would never leave evidence like this behind.<eos> Maybe she already used them to portal out of Storybrooke.<eos> Without Henry?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> What if something bad happened to her?<eos> Security system says the last time someone was in the office was around 6:00 this morning.<eos> They used an override code to get in.<eos> Why would Regina need an override code on her own alarm?<eos> She wouldn't.
281)}Explosion 198)}I'll kill you<eos> Kurosawa!<eos> You're making a big mistake if you think you'll get my inheritance!<eos> I don't intend to leave even 1 yen for you!<eos> I want to know the cause of the suicide of mother.<eos> Damn!<eos> Didn't the murderous intent arise inside you at that time?<eos> But I didn't kill him.<eos> Because he is my father.<eos> Would you?
- Tomorrow you start dance school.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> You don't expect to go through life without knowing how to dance?<eos> The rumba?<eos> Cha cha cha.<eos> And the tango Just think what you'll miss!<eos> - We miss most everything, don't we?<eos> - Tomorrow at 4:00, Barnum.<eos> - But no one wants to dance with me!<eos> - Why wouldn't they?
It wouldn't be the first time someone took the good book and twisted it for their own agenda.<eos> Ok, but if you wanted to change someone's sexual orientation, how could you do it?<eos> I mean, you're not gonna guilt somebody into that.<eos> Uh, I'm seeing some stuff about an ex-gay movement.<eos> It looks like some kind of a 12-step program.<eos> A 12-step program usually doesn't traumatize the participant.<eos> But conversion therapy might.<eos> Several conversion camps have been shut down recently 'cause their methods border on torture.<eos> Yeah, but why would any faith condone the torture of children?<eos> None of them would.
Stop!<eos> Don't.<eos> Go away!<eos> Think about your wife.<eos> Think about your son.<eos> All I can think of is Lucy.<eos> Every second of the day.<eos> Then think about her.<eos> She wouldn't want you to do this.<eos> Yes, she would.
Whatever.<eos> I mean, you can be as smooth as Velveeta, but at the end of the day, you got to take care of your girl.<eos> Protect her, you know?<eos> Keep her safe.<eos> This ain't no kind of crib.<eos> You be safe, Bullet.<eos> Like the music?<eos> You know what that is, Ray?<eos> You still got a job?<eos> Why wouldn't I?
First of all, my alcohol-saturated behavior aside,<eos> Jojo was the love of my life and she knows it.<eos> And secondly, I've lost clients before, detective.<eos> I'm not gonna start killing over lost business.<eos> I mean, if every distributor who's ever lost a client started killing the competition, there'd be no one left to buy booze from.<eos> Even clients like Sun Coast and the $2.5 million in sales?<eos> Don't tell me that wouldn't hit your bottom line.<eos> Not to mention your lifestyle, like that boat, the catered parties, all those eager shot-girl hopefuls.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, it would.
I won't go.<eos> I see, so you'll leave his lordship in the lurch, and probably lose your job, and all this to help me?<eos> Go home and pack.<eos> You are asking me to travel without a valet?<eos> I'm asking you not to take Bates.<eos> You do know the Americans have a correct uniform for practically every activity known to man?<eos> Thomas was your valet the whole time Bates was in prison.<eos> He knows how you like things done.<eos> Suppose he doesn't want to go?<eos> Why wouldn't he?
Yes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry for what?<eos> Where's Caitlyn?<eos> You know Roddy, don't you?<eos> Good news is you're both here, which means neither of you killed Eileen.<eos> That's off to a reasonably good start.<eos> Gentlemen, please don't even think about it.<eos> E-Eileen would want you two to be making peace.<eos> Like hell she would.
Thanks a million, Doc.<eos> We owe you.<eos> If you ever need me to set you up with a set of tires, say--<eos> What do you think of Nicholas?<eos> Andrew.<eos> We're calling him Andrew.<eos> Stan's brother.<eos> Have you held him yet?<eos> I told him, I says, "You're gonna drop him."<eos> I wouldn't.
You forgot?<eos> Four hundred years?<eos> Is that all it takes?<eos> - I moved on.<eos> - Where? Where can you be now, that you can forget something like that?<eos> - Spoilers.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> For once, I would like to know where I'm going.<eos> No, you really wouldn't.
In the meantime, any and all we have on the woman.<eos> You weren't being kind, about the music hall?<eos> Come, Rose - you know I am not that.<eos> Who'd have thought it, though.<eos> A man snatched, the police arriving...<eos> Sergeant Drake.<eos> He seem his self to you?<eos> Happy?<eos> Bella meets a need.<eos> A need you would not.
My father just died.<eos> I don't know, life's short, huh?<eos> It just kind of...<eos> I got to start doing things, Tran.<eos> Making moves, grown-up moves.<eos> I don't know, I want things.<eos> I want to, like, mow a lawn, you know, my lawn, in dark socks.<eos> What's my move with Jess?<eos> What would you do?<eos> Of course you would, you dirty dog.
I just don't like strangers touching my things.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> My mother had one just about like that.<eos> Not as nice as that one, but judging by the age of it, I'd say maybe it was your grandmother's?<eos> Yeah, I looked into at California sheep farmers with the last name of Edwards, and a 63-year-old woman named Gertrude Edwards died about 16 months ago in Mendota.<eos> Is that about the time that you ran away?<eos> I couldn't stay.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> No.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
- No, 2,600.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's a surprise.<eos> The rest are for Florrick.<eos> 28,158.<eos> We... Your Honor, um...<eos> Would you like to change your motion?<eos> Yes, we-- actually, we are going to withdraw the motion out of respect for the voting process.<eos> We'd like to make a motion, Your Honor.<eos> Of course you would.
Lift your head. Let's go to the stretcher.<eos> That's all, retire shoes.<eos> And the camouflage.<eos> Okay, Gherman Stepanovich!<eos> The result was in ten minutes better than Bykovski!<eos> - You saw how he tried?<eos> Okay, Gherman!<eos> It is more than visible.<eos> The man wants to go to space!<eos> - Of course, Grisha, and who would not?
I mean, technically it's just biscuit and gravy. Cause it's just one biscuit cut in half, see?<eos> No, even if it is just one biscuit, it's still biscuits and gravy.<eos> You know, how like one pair of pants still pants.<eos> I mean, you might want to take it with the Whataburger folks, because they're selling it as biscuit and gravy, see?<eos> Yeah, that, that- that doesn't it right.<eos> I mean, um, what would you call bacon and eggs if you only got one egg?<eos> - I would call it bacon and egg.<eos> - No, you would not.<eos> You would call it bacon and eggs.<eos> Anybody would.
- I know.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Am I getting here at a bad time?<eos> No.<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - You bet.<eos> You want to talk to Kristina?<eos> I would.
I mean, were we?<eos> No, you are close.<eos> Seriously, it's like... borderline epic.<eos> What do you remember?<eos> About anything.<eos> I mean, y-you seemed to... know what you were doing at the warehouse this morning.<eos> Which means, by definition, you must've stored and processed something in your memory banks.<eos> Look, you seem like a nice guy.<eos> But, honestly, if you keep asking me questions, I'm gonna have to break your neck, so, you know...<eos> I wouldn't.
All right? Do you know last year, they discovered a snub-nosed monkey?<eos> That's a brand new species they never even knew existed, - but they found it. - Yeah, but...<eos> And they never even found a body, dead or alive, but they found it.<eos> Not finding a tiny monkey in a giant rainforest the size of a continent is not the same as not finding a 900-pound hairy biped roaming around a very highly populated<eos> Pacific Northwest area.<eos> So, you're a ranger?<eos> Seventeen years.<eos> Is that cool if we, if we mentioned that or...?<eos> Oh, I don't think it's important.<eos> - I, I wouldn't.
And I promised her I'd have dinner with her tonight.<eos> Sean, we all have families.<eos> I don't specifically, but, if I did, they would understand that I have to work late.<eos> And so do you.<eos> It's just that I haven't been around much, and I promised I'd make her favorite, Chicken Parmesan.<eos> Oh. Chicken Parmesan.<eos> Why didn't you say so?<eos> That changes everything.<eos> Really?<eos> No. Why would it?
...allowed to vote in partisan primaries, but not in presidential elections.<eos> It's because everyone's downloading at the same time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, I read Hallie's column yesterday.<eos> - On Sandra Fluke?<eos> - That chick can write.<eos> I'll tell her you said so.<eos> She knows who I am?<eos> Sure. Yeah.<eos> Why wouldn't she?
Yeah, you guys go.<eos> You know, I want someone to be happy.<eos> - Maybe I'll just call Paul.<eos> - No!<eos> No, that is the worst thing you can do.<eos> Really?<eos> Haskell, I'm sorry, I can't leave Holly alone tonight.<eos> Would you mind taking a rain check?<eos> - Well, I...<eos> - Of course he wouldn't.
I'd definitely look for you.<eos> What if you still couldn't find me?<eos> I'll wait forever for your return.<eos> You don't have to wait.<eos> Why?<eos> It'll be too much pressure for me if I knew you would be waiting.<eos> Why don't we stop talking about it like it'll really happen?<eos> Please promise me that you won't wait.<eos> too... that you would never disappear from my sight.<eos> Of course I wouldn't.
However, this is nonsense, never swam.<eos> When we make money, Shep turned and paid all the bills ..<eos> "I wrote a check without coverage Let me get it right.." That's it.<eos> MC5 is an abbreviation for Motor City 5.<eos> Son of Detroit.<eos> Went to the music scene in Detroit, were the MC5 and The Stooges.<eos> In Shep develop my character to Alice.<eos> Said: "We have to invent something no one has seen before."<eos> I had a teacher who said "You can achieve a great cultural impact one of three things:<eos> - Violence, sex or rebellion" Alice would of the three.
(What's he playing at?<eos> ) I don't know.<eos> Call your next witness.<eos> Mrs Piggott of Lambton, please!<eos> GALLERY GASPS She wasn't at the inquest, is this something new?<eos> Yes, and I am afraid it could be dangerous.<eos> Mrs Piggott, you were at work in the Kings Arms the evening Mr and Mrs Wickham and Captain Denny set off in a coach for Pemberley, is that correct?<eos> It is.<eos> And would you say they were a happy party?<eos> I would not, Sir!
I'm sorry.<eos> I just, I...<eos> I didn't want to get stabbed.<eos> I was scared.<eos> See, that's where I get stuck.<eos> The way you jumped out of that barn, went down in that basement...<eos> I guess I'm just having a hard time believing that you were scared.<eos> I think you knew that my curse would kick in and save me. I really...<eos> I don't know the first thing about it.<eos> But Audrey Parker would.
It that a joke?<eos> Hmm. No.<eos> I'm being quite serious. Wow. What is it?<eos> It appears Neal marked his days trapped on this island.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Look here.<eos> Neal stopped counting.<eos> 'Cause he got off the island.<eos> He was here longer.<eos> Then why would he...
I run the Buenos Aires Morgue.<eos> It's an honor to have you visit.<eos> Yes, I imagine it is.<eos> Dr. Perez, I would like you to meet my husband, Seeley Booth.<eos> - We're on our honeymoon. - Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> And you came here?<eos> See?<eos> I wanted to go to the waterfall pools.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't.
Harassed by whom?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> No, it does matter.<eos> I can't... I can't say.<eos> Stacey, tell him right now.<eos> No!<eos> I...<eos> I promised Amy.<eos> And I am telling you that Amy would want you to tell.<eos> No, she really wouldn't.
I just wanted to save her.<eos> You were afraid of what your father was gonna do, right?<eos> I did everything I could.<eos> All it did was... I drove her to those tracks.<eos> No.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> You just tried to help.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> My father would've wanted it this way.<eos> No, he would not.
Just stop it.<eos> You don't salute a private!<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> All right.<eos> Lily, are you playing footsie with me?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> I was just feeling around for your shin.<eos> My shin?<eos> Why would you...?
We gonna find out who you are, and everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> She's just a hired staff doctor at the hospital, which is how come they can make her fill in and cover over here.<eos> A crucifix and a rosary.<eos> Oh, and save that cake for Sandy.<eos> Poor thing went through a lot of trouble to make that.<eos> She should get that back.<eos> You really think she wants to eat her dead sister's birthday cake?<eos> Why not?<eos> I would.
Great.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Say... you didn't open this, did you?<eos> 'Cause it looks like someone ripped it open, and then... crudely rewrapped it.<eos> Must have come that way.<eos> Damn post office.<eos> Oh, and another thing.<eos> There was an odd little man in a child's police costume at my house earlier asking strange questions.<eos> You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?<eos> I would not.
Then she'll move to England.<eos> But, is she getting married here?<eos> Didn't we get invited to the wedding?<eos> Sátur will attend.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cipri... when you can, take these clothes to the parish.<eos> You and Sátur can keep the bedroom.<eos> Gonzalo...<eos> I understand you not wanting to go to that wedding.<eos> I wouldn't, either.
Good one.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Uh, what about medications?<eos> Love 'em.<eos> No, I-I think they mean "are you taking any now?"<eos> Oh, let's see, there's plaxitril for my depression, zaxaprin for my anxiety, dilapamin for my insomnia, and clodex for my occasional bouts of rage.<eos> No one likes an angry Hore.<eos> Why didn't you tell me we were going to a gay bar?<eos> 'Cause if I told you, you wouldn't have come.<eos> Yes, I would.
I got shot.<eos> Ok, what?<eos> See, right there.<eos> That's exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Does dad know?<eos> No.<eos> Of course not. Why would he?
That was on the list?<eos> Does stealing?<eos> What you Tessa?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Doing all I can, as fast as you can.<eos> Well, you should stop.<eos> Prefer to spend the rest of my life, below The blankets on the couch, with my head on your shoulder.<eos> If...<eos> I wish. Can you blame me?<eos> Yes, of course I would.
He tried to get rid of the body.<eos> The killer was watching and he called in that anonymous tip.<eos> Your honour...<eos> I'm with you this time, Miss Danville.<eos> Ask a question, counsel.<eos> Here's my question.<eos> Detective...<eos> Do you know who this is?<eos> No, I have no idea who he is.<eos> No, you wouldn't, would you.
That's all part of the service.<eos> I knew you wouldn't be able to keep away.<eos> How was Berlin?<eos> I'm here for Jo.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'll grab my coat.<eos> OK.<eos> Are you ignoring me?<eos> No more than I would any random receptionist.
See you later.<eos> Don't walk out again.<eos> C'mon, we need to talk.<eos> It can't go on.<eos> For anyone.<eos> I know things are shit right now, and I know you're angry but...<eos> But if you don't get to the cause of this then you're going to end up exploding...<eos> I could I could talk to that counsellor you keep banging on about.<eos> If you like.<eos> Yeah, I would.

I know, you know, it's the end of the semester and I also know there's budgetary issues. And that you have to let a few professors go.<eos> And so when I got the note in my box, I think I just assumed the worst.<eos> Would you be afraid to get fired if your job was to clean the floor at one of those coin-operated jack-off booths?<eos> You know, where you're the one holding the mop.<eos> Um, fired from a jack-off booth?<eos> Where the truckers go and masturbate.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know what you're talking about.<eos> Well?<eos> Would you? Um...

Um...<eos> No.<eos> I would not.
The s.E.C. Offered him full immunity for his testimony.<eos> The only reason they'd agree to do that is if they believed the evidence they had was real and prosecutable.<eos> Is it possible somebody may have switched the drives before you got to him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> After I threatened Tyler in the limo, he raced right back to the hotel. I wasn't that far behind, but still...<eos> Who else knew why Tyler was really here?<eos> Malcolm maybe?<eos> No. He never accessed personnel files.<eos> Tyler Barrett's name wouldn't mean anything to him.<eos> But it would to Siobhan.
She was so concerned about Dustin, she didn't know what she was saying.<eos> But you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> David.<eos> David, you have to believe that.<eos> Look, you trust Charlie, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's responsible for all the kids at the youth center.<eos> Now you think she'd let you play with them if it wasn't safe?<eos> I guess not.<eos> No, she wouldn't, just like we wouldn't.
Er, no, not at all, as a matter of fact.<eos> I was very invigorated by the idea of, er, trying to forge a new way in politics.<eos> Mm-hmm, so all was rosy?<eos> Well, um, can't think of any negatives.<eos> No friction?<eos> No, the only F word was fun.<eos> Thank you, Mr Cullen.<eos> Mr Cullen.<eos> Would you say there's a culture of leaking in the government?<eos> Yes, I would.
Your father wouldn't understand, he'd be furious.<eos> He wouldn't have to know.<eos> No.<eos> It's not right.<eos> Those are the types of lies that got you into this position in the first place.<eos> Is this what you want, mum?<eos> Please don't ask me to go against your father's wishes.<eos> If it is the only way that we can have any contact, then wouldn't that end justify the means?<eos> No.<eos> It wouldn't.
She's trying to deny her feelings.<eos> It's a dangerous phase.<eos> I don't see the need for you to go after her.<eos> I'll be living alone soon, so you can probably stop now.<eos> And I'm honestly running out of money now.<eos> - A change of heart?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - So you want her back now?<eos> - No, that's not it.<eos> - Why the hell would I?
Would you...?<eos> Where?<eos> Where?<eos> How much is it?<eos> How much is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> How much is taken off?<eos> I feel so violated.<eos> I would, too.
The military uses them to scan dangerous areas before they send in their troops, and now the police want to use them in the same way.<eos> - Or to spy on people.<eos> - Or that.<eos> It's a flat-out violation of the Fourth Amendment...<eos> Warrantless Search 101.<eos> The problem is, who do we sue?<eos> I mean, the police?<eos> That's not gonna get her job back.<eos> We'd get damages.<eos> Not much, we wouldn't.
Are you?<eos> Are you afraid, Mrs. Denchy?<eos> I mean, the idea of a kid leaving high school would terrify most parents.<eos> Are you terrified just a bit?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's a different world now, isn't it?<eos> As different as it may be, Ms. Blake, a boy still has his best chance in life by going to college, and you don't get there by dropping out of high school to invent Twitter apps.<eos> It's certainly normal for a loving parent to have dreams for her child.<eos> What parent wouldn't?
And I... I just don't think it's gonna work out with us.<eos> But I should've just told you that instead of doing that silly stunt with joy.<eos> Melanie, I just want you to be happy.<eos> And if that means we should break up, then so be it.<eos> Aw, don't look so sad.<eos> You'll find somebody new.<eos> Once you get out of this hospital and your leg gets rehabilitated...<eos> Oh, hey, you wanna be my new girlfriend?<eos> Of course!<eos> Who wouldn't?
Brett Denning. What can I do for you?<eos> Okay, seriously?<eos> Gwen, get that guy from maintenance back down here.<eos> That gunk is still all over my travertine floors.<eos> Right away, doctor.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> My practice is based on perfection.<eos> Wouldn't do to have imperfections<eos> - in the waiting room, now, would it?<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
- So, what killed this thing?<eos> - Good question.<eos> Agents down the hall say they heard the screams.<eos> By the time they opened the door, it was on the floor writhing in pain, and then it just died.<eos> On the case we worked before he was working with a partner.<eos> He was infected too but didn't know.<eos> - Almost transformed days later.<eos> - We should find him.<eos> Yeah, I've been trying to think of his name, but I can't remember it.<eos> Olivia would, though.
Whatever the problem is, solve it, calmly, by talking it out.<eos> Think more and fight less!<eos> Let's clean this up.<eos> Why do they call me Big Wolf?<eos> It's because when I was younger, I was weak.<eos> My family wanted to make me stronger so they gave me a fierce name to live up to.<eos> And actually, I do want to turn into a wolf.<eos> But I have a really hard time imagining how that would be.<eos> Would he get hair on his face? Long hair?<eos> And would his eyes...
I'm coming with you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Lew, thanks for helping.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry about all this, Bobby.<eos> It's devastating what Lobell has done.<eos> I've known him for a long time, and I pegged him as a good guy.<eos> Well, I worked with him for 30 years.<eos> I want to break his neck.<eos> I would, too, son.
Now I'm gonna get the club to sign off on your cash, but I need Trager outside.<eos> Him knowing I saved his life gives me an internal advantage I'm gonna need.<eos> And when I'm done... you can send him out the same way you did his kid.<eos> 'Cause I really don't give a shit.<eos> There you go.<eos> Finding the hidden advantage in an unfortunate circumstance.<eos> Using pain to take you to the next level.<eos> Those are the things that turn players into kings.<eos> Yeah, I guess you would know.<eos> Yes, I would.
Don't say anything, I'm not asking where you were, I'm not involved.<eos> I'd also be looking at who knew means of access to a secure car park in a top-quality apartment block.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, there's only two ways out of that building.<eos> One way is through the building itself which the attacker couldn't have done, because the entrances are biometrically controlled.<eos> The other way is by using Nick's key fob to open the metal grille to the car park.<eos> Who would know that?<eos> Well, from where I'm sitting, you would.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course I would.
I'll do my best.<eos> Do you recognise him, Lix?<eos> No.<eos> He's not a politician or a head of state.<eos> Are you sure? Darling, I can recite the name of every minister, Prime Minister and President in my sleep.<eos> Going down?<eos> Actually, I was hoping to take you out for lunch.<eos> I can't.<eos> I want to kiss you.<eos> Oh? I wouldn't.
You know they'll kick off!<eos> If they're frightfully brave and well-behaved, they'll get a jelly baby afterwards.<eos> You'd better hurry up, otherwise all the black ones will be gone.<eos> Ah! Watch out!<eos> Come on, mind out me way!<eos> I want a star on top of this, not somebody's eyeball.<eos> Season's greetings to you too!<eos> Do I have to undress him?<eos> It's on the nippy side in 'ere.<eos> Down to his napkin, if you would, Mrs Duncan.
I come to thee<eos> From plume-plucked Richard;<eos> Who with willing soul<eos> Adopts thee heir Ascend his throne,<eos> Descending now from him;<eos> And long live Henry, fourth of that name!<eos> In God's name,<eos> I'll ascend the regal throne.<eos> Marry. God forbid!<eos> Would God that any in this noble presence
Ah, there's Jade.<eos> Jade!<eos> - What's this dark little beverage?<eos> - Soy sauce.<eos> Okay, I'm here... why?<eos> Because you two need to learn to play a husband and wife believably.<eos> What does that have to do with Sushi?<eos> ! Listen, I once did a show where I had to play a man in great pain, so to prepare, I threw myself down a flight of stairs.<eos> You wouldn't believe how many times I hit my head.<eos> - Yeah, we would.
They still just get you from point "a" to point "b."<eos> Uh, point "a" to point "b" in style.<eos> Okay, well, what would you buy if you won the lottery?<eos> Oh, that's easy.<eos> Castle in Scotland, house on Pebble Beach.<eos> Winter and summer sorted.<eos> All for the joy of golf.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yet something tells me if you won, you'd still stay on the job.<eos> Oh, but you wouldn't?
Like hearing thoughts.<eos> Sometimes it might be a strain to listen.<eos> Sometimes you can't hear much at all.<eos> Come to think of it, I have been a little off my game lately.<eos> What we are and what you are, Sookie, is magical.<eos> But as you are only half fae, your magic is finite.<eos> You will run out if you aren't careful how and how much you use it.<eos> What happens if I do run out?<eos> Would I die?<eos> - You wouldn't, but-
I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Come here.<eos> It's gonna be ok.<eos> It's gonna be ok.<eos> All right.<eos> I love you.<eos> Go play back there.<eos> Of course Will thought Matthew was a hostage.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
They're a mix between water spaniels and labradors.<eos> And, now, the reason they're called retrievers is because men would go out hunting.<eos> You see, they would shoot the birds, and sometimes the birds would fall into the pond.<eos> They would need a cool dog to be able to go swim and retrieve them, you see.<eos> Okay, let's just slow down for a second, buddy.<eos> I want to talk to your mom about this.<eos> Now, mom, we are looking at dogs.<eos> We're thinking about getting a dog.<eos> We're not necessarily getting a dog.<eos> Why wouldn't we?
- So he's not the deadliest.<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> What about him versus a shark?<eos> - The shark.<eos> - What, even on dry land?<eos> No, I guess on dry land the shark would probably dry out.<eos> I can't believe I'm even playing this game.<eos> Look, there are plenty of animals that could kill Stephen Hawking.<eos> - Like a badger?<eos> - Yes, a badger probably would.
In an ideal world?<eos> I'd have started operating about 20 minutes ago.<eos> Hello, Emily. How are you doing?<eos> So how you been keeping?<eos> Good, yeah. You?<eos> Had a bit of a toothache a while back, like, but it cleared up all by itself.<eos> Hospital visitor standards are really slipping.<eos> I wouldn't want my real husband here if I was going through this, let alone my ex.<eos> Do you think Anna would want you by her bedside?<eos> Of course she would.
As I told you, it's small but charming...<eos> --What a hole...<eos> Here is the garden, very charming itself, and a surprise... The icing on the cake... the garden leads straight to the sea!<eos> Does the rent includes a motorbike to get to the beach?<eos> Great!<eos> Now you just have to sign the contract.<eos> Why a house?<eos> I prefer the hotel.<eos> --Hotels get controlled... I don't wanna end up in jail.<eos> Why would you?
But they have a chance with us.<eos> - That one tortured me and others.<eos> - He had to so they wouldn't question his loyalty, so he could gain access to their plans and most importantly, so he could find others like him.<eos> That doesn't add up.<eos> History is full of excuses like "I was only following orders."<eos> There's no excuse for murdering innocent people.<eos> He didn't kill you.<eos> You're alive.<eos> - He saved your life.<eos> - Why? Why would he?
Maybe it's Jenny Jones asking if he'll be on the show.<eos> Dallas Cowboys.<eos> See, I figured the best place to start my online Cowboys business was Dallas, and I was looking for a web site to start it and I<eos> Darn tootin'. What? !<eos> Hello? Hello? Hey!<eos> Hello? back, and I'm prepared to pay for it.<eos> Why don't I fly you and your friends to Cowboys training camp, watch a little practice, meet some players, we'll talk a little business.<eos> I can't imagine that my friends would want to... what?<eos> !<eos> Yes, we would!
Huh? Oh, right.<eos> Good business?<eos> Till they finish that new highway, we're the last gas 'til Staten Island.<eos> What's he got in there?<eos> - The truck?<eos> - Yeah. I... Fish?<eos> Says fish.<eos> Could be something else. That come off the ocean, right?<eos> I wouldn't have a clue about that.<eos> Who would?
The one you really loved.<eos> Well, look, uh... if you ever, you know... feel the need to talk, uh...<eos> I've heard there are people that do that sort of thing.<eos> Off you go, now.<eos> I got an idea. Uh-oh.<eos> We sue the DA's Office for slander, defamation of character, and we also go after Odom personally.<eos> He's the handling DA.<eos> He'd have qualified immunity.<eos> We can't.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
So after the second verse, I think we should go out on a double chorus.<eos> No bridge?<eos> We're gonna have a 6-minute song.<eos> I think we have to have a bridge.<eos> Do you have any orange juice?<eos> I got some vodka.<eos> You think they're still alive?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> I wouldn't want to get in between those two.<eos> Actually... I would.
I dunno. I had chin-chin in here as well.<eos> I had 'em last night, after tea.<eos> Let me know if you touch my stuff, all right?<eos> 'Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> ' You keep stuff like this for sentimental value, to hold onto a memory.<eos> I wanna make new memories with you, baby.<eos> It'll take some time, but you don't have to stay.<eos> Mint! There's a Killer tourney on at the pub.<eos> D'you ever do any work?<eos> Why would I?
Baldness is for women's crotches, not men's heads.<eos> There you go, that's pretty gross.<eos> Yeah, that's the spirit, Quagmire.<eos> Oh, boy, listen, thanks for putting up with me the last couple weeks.<eos> Hey, no problem.<eos> You put up with me when I was barefoot guy.<eos> Boy, nothing like a beer with the fellas, eh?<eos> Peter, would you mind putting on some shoes?<eos> Oh, you mean foot prisons?<eos> Yes, I would.
What's inside?<eos> Five great toys for the price of three.<eos> Which ones?<eos> It's a mystery.<eos> Yeah, I need to know which toys.<eos> You can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because it's a mystery.<eos> How will people know what they're buying?<eos> Well, they wouldn't, John.
It's a downloaded file, right?<eos> The DVD you made for the Beltran case, the DVD the cops gave to McVeigh.<eos> It's from a digital file.<eos> Uh, yeah, I guess. Why?<eos> Can you get me the original analogue surveillance footage?<eos> It's late, Kalinda.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because a compressed file drops frames. And I need to see every frame.<eos> - Thank you for coming.<eos> - Why wouldn't I?
I transferred the memory where they were stored into quarantine.<eos> They're cut off from the rest of the ship now, and us.<eos> That's what I did, to save you.<eos> Wow.<eos> Space deer.<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> They're going to look even more beautiful slow-roasted and served up with a side of Becker's mash.<eos> You're not serious.<eos> Uh, and how exactly would you cook 'em?<eos> I wouldn't.
You don't know me.<eos> The doctor says you're going to be fine.<eos> And your family's on the way.<eos> But that was a crazy thing you did, Meg.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just wanted us to be closer.<eos> Look, Meg, I do care for you, but I care for you like I...<eos> I would a niece or a good friend's daughter.
Makes perfect sense.<eos> If he was thinking about experimenting, he'd do it with animals first.<eos> Desensitize himself to the cruelty, then he could practice his methods.<eos> - On pigs?<eos> - Their skin is similar to ours.<eos> Remember the guy's name?<eos> Kevin, Melvin-- something, I don't know.<eos> Car's here.<eos> Did this guy tell you why he wanted to use these pigs?<eos> He wouldn't.
- Same one who wanted to cure Debbie of falmouth.<eos> That means something to you?<eos> - It means he...<eos> Raped the wrong woman.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So you're saying Ann was the target, not Debbie.<eos> Why?<eos> - I can't say.<eos> I'm a psychiatrist.<eos> It would violateprivilegepriviledge.
Don't be ridiculous.<eos> You deny he had designs on your wife?<eos> Designs on her?<eos> No, he had his hands on her.<eos> I saw it with my own eyes.<eos> Well. How did you respond?<eos> I beat him soundly.<eos> Cuffed him good and proper right in the street.<eos> But you continued to harbour resentment toward him?<eos> Any man would, Detective.
Nope.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Going off with Rick to look for Sophia.<eos> I thought he was talking with Hershel.<eos> He is.<eos> We're gonna go after.<eos> I'm headed to the barn in the meantime.<eos> Shane wants a watch duty down there.<eos> Does Rick?<eos> Why wouldn't he?
- Get her out of the way!<eos> Dominik!<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> - You're here to see...?<eos> - Don't touch me!<eos> - Doctor Lewandowski?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Mr and Mrs Santorski?<eos> Your son had an acting-out when the police came...<eos> - Wouldn't you?
Get on.<eos> What?<eos> He escaped?<eos> Those fools!<eos> But we have attained all the items.<eos> Does he look like a guy that will easily let it go?<eos> Also, he knows too much.<eos> If we just leave this as is, this might backfire to snag us.<eos> No matter what, you must find him and get rid of him.<eos> Why would Grandpa to Choi Ryu...
Place the device.<eos> Sir, is there anything you want to tell me?<eos> Don't screw it up.<eos> A surgeon doing the early stages of human trials on his experimental procedure never hands over the reins to someone else, ever, unless something is wrong.<eos> Altman said this was weird,<eos> - but I just thought she was being a wife.<eos> - Bailey...<eos> Are you drinking again?<eos> Ooh, that would explain a lot.<eos> Yes, it would.
I've just gotta put her down for a minute.<eos> You've got to stop him!<eos> -Me?<eos> -Yes, you!<eos> Take this stake and just drive it into Fred's heart.<eos> Why do I have to do it?<eos> Why can't we get a grown-up to do it or something?<eos> This is your sister, and it's because you and Talia have the same blood.<eos> So?<eos> Why would that...
See anything interesting tonight?<eos> Nothing worth mentioning.<eos> Be here tomorrow, 10:00 sharp.<eos> I hope you're out of there.<eos> Do you know what she does, yet?<eos> She does favors for a price.<eos> She's a fixer.<eos> Assuming then that she's the victim.<eos> Any ideas who'd want to take her out?<eos> Who wouldn't?
We've been following the investigation.<eos> Jim's been good enough to keep us up-to-date with the others.<eos> All those girls.<eos> I can't believe that nobody's been able to catch up with this monster.<eos> We will, soon.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Now don't lose hope.<eos> Molly wouldn't want that, now, would she?<eos> No, she wouldn't.
We just need to go something i think because the forgone conclusion might be that it's gonna be me,maybe you.<eos> Jim and i developed a good partnership moving forward.<eos> But numerically,it doesn't seem completely straightforward that we're going to be able to get rid of elyse because right now it's jim and i on board to vote for elyse.<eos> There has to be somebody else willing to do this or else we're screwed.<eos> i mean**<eos> I was talking to,um,jim,and i don't think jim's fond of getting rid of ozzy.<eos> Who is closest to ode?<eos> Elyse?<eos> I think she's in ozzy's back pocket.<eos> would***
Don't look so worried, Merlin, I don't really think you want to kill me.<eos> Aconite.<eos> Wolfsbane to you.<eos> The deadliest poison known to man.<eos> What was it doing on Arthur's food?<eos> Merlin took some from here earlier.<eos> He was really angry when he realised Arthur wasn't going to eat it.<eos> He has been behaving very strangely.<eos> Why would Merlin want to kill Arthur?<eos> He wouldn't.
Gold savings accounts, gold investment accounts, gold IRA accounts.<eos> U.S. coins, international coins...<eos> I was watching that.<eos> Through the blanket?<eos> Oh, well, I was listening anyway.<eos> Yeah, I mean, because there's nothing more soothing than the sound of somebody trying to sell you gold coins, right?<eos> You know, I need something to block out the sound of the ocean 'cause the waves keep crashing over and over and over again, Steven.<eos> Some would say it's a relaxing sound, Danny.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Some people would.
- Thanks, man.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah, somebody likes to show up at detective rackets and drink all our booze, even though he's never been a detective.<eos> Never will be either.<eos> Couldn't be if he wanted to.<eos> Deputy Chief of Patrol Costello.<eos> Yeah, well, you want me to bum-rush him out of here, man?<eos> 'Cause I will.<eos> You ever wanna haul off and punch him in the face?<eos> - I would.
Excuse me?<eos> You don't do it to white people.<eos> Anyway, I'm not saying you... Wait.<eos> We don't do it to who? Oh my God!<eos> First of all, I don't understand why you bring this guy's race into it.<eos> There's 40,000 cops in this city... Yes...<eos> And I hate to disillusion you, but most of them are pretty good guys just trying' to do their job.<eos> Now, the bottom line is the DA is not gonna take this case.<eos> Now, you could take it up with my sergeant if you want to, but he's...<eos> Yes, I would.
Miss Taggart.<eos> If you're here for your rails they won't be tempered and cooled for a few days.<eos> I'm just here to discuss our deal.<eos> Please, sit.<eos> So, what's the premium to rush these rails?<eos> Forty thousand dollars a ton.<eos> That's the best price you can give me?<eos> I could charge you double and you'd pay.<eos> You could.<eos> And I would
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> That guy?<eos> Razor?<eos> Razor?<eos> What does he have to do with anything?<eos> Have you seen him in Boulder?<eos> Yes, we happen to work togeer.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Everywhere you go there's somebody that wants to be with you, which is a lot of fun for me.<eos> Of course, why wouldn't they?
I'm gay, aren't I?<eos> I am.<eos> I am. I'm totally gay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Kitty, I mean, mom would have a breakdown.<eos> And dad?<eos> Dad would kill me.<eos> I wouldn't care.<eos> You wouldn't?
I do if you can resuscitate an electrocuted person.<eos> Can you wire the doorbell to the dog?<eos> Okay, that's lunch.<eos> Dude, why do you keep fixing my spelling?<eos> We're back in at 3:00.<eos> No, 3:30.<eos> Enjoy the town, everyone.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Now who would like to join me on a morale-boosting tour of Boston's historic freedom trail?<eos> Ooh, I would...
How unimportant you are.<eos> Ma'am, you in't so happy, is you?<eos> I am sitting at the kitchen table past two am. It is not exactly a mystery.<eos> Ma'am, it is because you went to the Manor, in't it?<eos> Minnie, I think that sometimes you forget your role in my household!<eos> I am troubled, Minnie, because I sense something is sorely wrong in the life of a dear friend of mine.<eos> Now, is that enough to send you back to your bed?<eos> It is, Ma'am.<eos> Unless you would like two slices of bacon and a crust of bread.<eos> I would.
And i hope everybody realizes i did it for the team and not for me.<eos> I'm a little pissed off right now.<eos> I'm a lot pissed off right now.<eos> Don't know about j.t as much as i did a few hours ago.<eos> heroes** so***<eos> They think i saved them. I didn't.<eos> I got rid of cirie while i had the chance.<eos> And i swear,i will never,never turn on you guys,nerve. - Really?<eos> - I swear,i swear.<eos> Man,i would never.
We'll have something to show you in the morning.<eos> But the suspense is killing me.<eos> Well, I kind of was on my way out.<eos> Let me just see where we are.<eos> I guess I've got a minute.<eos> Okay.<eos> We thought that Samsonite is this very rare element, this mythical substance, the hardest on earth, and we see an adventurer leaping through a cave.<eos> Is this a substance much like bullshit?<eos> I thought we could drop one off the Eiffel Tower, with a countdown, like the moon shot and show how it doesn't break.<eos> -But it would, wouldn't it?
I believe there's an answer which would secure your future and give you a position.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> Just think about it.<eos> I don't have to think about it.<eos> Marry a man who can barely hold his knife like a gentleman?<eos> Oh, you exaggerate.<eos> You're American, you don't understand these things.<eos> Have you mentioned this to Granny?<eos> Did she laugh?<eos> Why would she?
We have been entrusted with a duty of care for this delicate tot. We must be rigorous in our consideration.<eos> Perhaps tomorrow might be a little warmer.<eos> I could take her out then.<eos> But we do have a moral responsibility to seek out her owner.<eos> Of course we do and so we will, my dear.<eos> I propose that we put up a notice.<eos> "Dog found." That will certainly attract the attention of anyone who might know of her master.<eos> Do you suppose she might care for another bowl of warm milk?<eos> Would you like warm milky-milky?<eos> You would, wouldn't you?
Detective Crabtree?<eos> Miss Ogden!<eos> Erm, I'm a constable.<eos> How forgetful of me.<eos> Er, Detective Murdoch's not in right now.<eos> But if... Actually, I'm here to see you.<eos> To see me?<eos> I need to speak further with you for my article.<eos> Yes, well, I wouldn't want to impede your writing.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
A qualified doct--<eos> - I don't know what they're doing up there.<eos> - Well, they just put the-- - what year are we in?<eos> They--<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They put their finger up--<eos> That's what I mean, though. - Why?<eos> Why are they still using the index finger? -<eos> What, you'd prefer the forefinger or the thumb,<eos> - Would you? - Karl:
What happened?<eos> They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.<eos> Did he get superpowers?<eos> No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, that's disappointing.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.<eos> Yeah, but who'd want to become Rat-Man?<eos> Who wouldn't?
Exactly.<eos> They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.<eos> Did- - Leonard?<eos> I'm no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.<eos> Oh! Good.<eos> I'm eight for 26 this month.<eos> Yeah, I think I'll pass.<eos> But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.<eos> Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we'd still be together.<eos> Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't. Uh-huh.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Psychogenic fugues affect less than 0. 2% of the population.<eos> And daniel is in that 0.2%?<eos> Yes. He's a textbook case.<eos> Dr. Levenson, in your experience,<eos> Are there any lasting side effects?<eos> No.<eos> When it's over, it's over.<eos> Someone coming out of a fugue state Wouldn't have any diminished physical or mental capacity?<eos> No, he wouldn't.
Mr. Jordan.<eos> Mr. Jordan, please stop.<eos> You're not real.<eos> If I threw you in front of a car, it would drive right through you!<eos> No!<eos> No... Sir!<eos> I am real!<eos> Would an imaginary me know that you have a mole on your list of pets to get?<eos> Or that your favorite color is rainbow?<eos> Of course it would.
All of your page duties stop right now.<eos> The welfare of this bird is your only concern.<eos> He lives... Or you die.<eos> I was about to suggest the same thing.<eos> Hey, dummy,<eos> What are you doing to grizz?<eos> Whoa, you watch your mouth, Before I show you the back of my hand.<eos> Look, you gotta grow up about this best man thing.<eos> Liz lemon, I don't even want to be best man.<eos> Why would I?
Look.<eos> And, um...<eos> Here's mine.<eos> Fuck.<eos> They do... they do kind of look alike.<eos> Fuck!<eos> What am I supposed to do with that information?<eos> Oh, let me guess.<eos> You want me to tell you.<eos> Yes, I would.
You still thinking about that one...<eos> With the smell?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That one?<eos> What smell?<eos> You know, that funky smell.<eos> It's kind of hard to describe.<eos> It was like canned soup or something.<eos> Buddy, you want to live in a place that smells like broccoli soup?<eos> Yeah, who would?
So you thought you'd handle it man-to-man?<eos> Did you contact your platoon leader?<eos> No, sir. And you didn't conduct a home visit<eos> To ensure Mrs. Evans' safety?<eos> No, sir.<eos> You think it's okay to hit women, staff sergeant?<eos> No, sir!<eos> 'cause it sure looks like it to me.<eos> Mrs. Evans never came back to see me, sir.<eos> Why would she?
I need to talk to you about your karma.<eos> Why did you think I would take Maya to the dance?<eos> What?<eos> You thought I wanted her as my date.<eos> "A" sent me a picture... of you and Maya kissing.<eos> So, can I just ask?<eos> I mean, you took Toby to the dance, but then you took that picture with Maya.<eos> I think I know what I want, but if I say yes to Maya, everything would change.<eos> - You know it would.<eos> - Yeah, it would.
Yeah, but your total cholesterol is 200.<eos> That's high?<eos> Yeah, higher than it should be.<eos> - So what does that mean?<eos> - One of two things.<eos> Either you modify your diet and start to exercise, or I put you on cholesterol medication.<eos> - Can I think about it?<eos> - Wrong answer.<eos> Also, Hank, would it help if he avoided stressful situations from now on?<eos> Yeah, sure, it would.
Twelve-year-old child, both sets of genitals.<eos> Parents don't know what to choose...<eos> The meat and potatoes or the stinky fish salad.<eos> Hey, sport, let me ask you a question.<eos> When Dad here takes you to the ballpark, do you like a foot-long frank or a hot, steaming plate of vagina?<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Leplante, why now?<eos> - Ray's always wanted a son...<eos> - Scalpel!<eos> But I've always wanted a girl.<eos> What mother wouldn't?
"Murder covered by the entire earth will still reveal itself."<eos> Really?<eos> Interesting.<eos> - Shakespeare said it, in Hamlet.<eos> - Nice saying.<eos> I'm using it in my thesis.<eos> He has another: "Murder does not have a language yet it will speak."<eos> But when?<eos> Would you want to read a crime novel if the crime is not resolved in the end?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Um, excuse me.<eos> I was just about to use that.<eos> - What is this, some kind of stupid joke?<eos> - No.<eos> Not unless you think stealing a 14-ton truck is a joke.<eos> Yeah, a delivery truck was hijacked from Big Foods At 1:00 in the morning.<eos> It was discovered at 5:40 a.m. minus its contents.<eos> You gonna tell me you don't know<eos> - anything about that?<eos> - Why would I?
Dinner tomorrow night?<eos> I don't know. I might be persuaded.<eos> Hey, uh, what time are you home?<eos> You, uh, want to grab some dinner before the dance?<eos> Don't you have work?<eos> I'm leaving early.<eos> This dance only happens once a year, you know?<eos> Thank God.<eos> You know, I still can't believe we're actually going.<eos> Well, why wouldn't we?
It was actually kind of adorable.<eos> This is clearly gonna come as a surprise to you, but I had no idea you were gay.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Not that it matters, 'cause I'm like totally down with that.<eos> You know, I mean...<eos> I'm down with other people being down with that.<eos> But that's nohow I get down.<eos> Wait, I don't get it.<eos> How could you not know?<eos> Well, why would I?
But before you do that, just have a little look... at this.<eos> It's a disabled parking badge.<eos> Yes, it is, Susan.<eos> You just think, no more pay-and-display, no more long walks to the shops, no more circling the car parks for a space.<eos> Do you want to hold it?<eos> May I?<eos> I mean...you tried to give the money back, didn't you?<eos> I did, didn't I?<eos> But they wouldn't let you.<eos> They wouldn't...
'Senna goes through again!<eos> '<eos> Ayrton Senna did race in Formula 1 from 1984- to his death at Imola in 1994.<eos> 'Ayrton Senna wins at Monaco. '<eos> In that time, he won the world championship three times.<eos> The figures suggest that Schumacher and Fangio were better, but the people who know, they tell a different story.<eos> I think, Senna, I would put him in number one.<eos> For me, Senna is number one.<eos> For me, he was number one.<eos> I would Ayrton Senna as number one.
She sounded like herself, considering the circumstances.<eos> You say that her lexical features are consistent with her vernacular?<eos> Huh? Are the words hers?<eos> Yeah, that's what she said.<eos> I need to ask you about the words that Jenny used.<eos> Does it sound like something that she would say?<eos> Does she sound like herself?<eos> We never--we never told her to not be afraid.<eos> Why would she say that?<eos> She wouldn't.
You may not rely on feel or on the flow of traffic.<eos> It is essential to monitor your speedometer.<eos> But wouldn't that mean you'd have to take your eyes off the road?<eos> Wouldn't you flunk me for that?<eos> Just the opposite.<eos> Proper driving requires that you regularly glance away from the road ahead to your instrument panel, your mirrors.<eos> Or over your shoulder to change lanes.<eos> Yes, good.<eos> So if my client were to say to 911 that she just looked up and she was there, that wouldn't necessarily suggest any lack of due care on her part or negligence.<eos> It would not, no.
We took care of the vigil.<eos> We rescheduled it for next week.<eos> I... killed him.<eos> I could not...<eos> Stop myself.<eos> I get it.<eos> I've been there.<eos> But he murdered a dozen people, and he was planning to kill more.<eos> Look, deep down, nobody minds what you did.<eos> Father Jensen... He would.
I mean, do you have any sort of plan of how you'll provide for her financially?<eos> I have no plan whatsoever.<eos> And you do realize if you had offspring they would be mixed children?<eos> They could be made fun of on the playground.<eos> I was made fun of on the playground and I turned out pretty cool.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Just as I have found what I'm looking for here maybe it's time you found what you're looking for.<eos> Steven, if you would like to take a Mexican wife -<eos> Yes, I would.
Jake is gonna look dashing, and after the photo shoot,<eos> We'll go have nasty, acrobatic sex In positions that you can't even draw.<eos> Oh, pretty much anyone can draw a stick figure, so...<eos> God...<eos> Who let him in here?<eos> I did.<eos> I'm just pitching' in, aiding' the cause, Helpin' the angels of spirit Make the world a cheerier place.<eos> Savannah, does he talk that much during sex?<eos> I wouldn't know. Right.<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
Your plan for today's challenge worked out well.<eos> Well, pro void it had medallion of power wasn't in the play I think it would have been a much more competitive challenge. Marty, is that your take as well?<eos> Yeah, we had one more item to go, they had two to start out with so at the very least it would have been a close match or we could have had a leg up.<eos> To be clear, you had one more item, a set of keys, a chest, three locks and getting it back.<eos> It's behind us, we've got to move forward.<eos> Fixing what we can at camp, that's the meant I attitude you have to have.<eos> Dan, you sat out of the challenge... yet again.<eos> I told everybody on the tribe that I do not feel comfortable because of my knee sloshing around in mud. If you put me on level ground I'll go up against anybody.<eos> But why would I want to do something that I know I'm not good at and possibly hurt the tribe?<eos> No, I wouldn't either.
I'm doing a parachute jump for charity.<eos> "I'm doing a parachute jump for charity."<eos> Show off.<eos> Get out!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Well, he's making me feel guilty.<eos> You see, people DO things with their lives.<eos> I mean, what will people say at my funeral?<eos> Seriously, would I have a good eulogy?<eos> Of course you would.
You all right?<eos> Yeah. How are you gorgeous, are you all right?<eos> Are you going to see your Granddad?<eos> Get Granddad with your sword? Yeah!<eos> Granddad!<eos> Hiya, sweetheart, come here, give us a cuddle!<eos> It's a bit early for that.<eos> No, don't! If your lawyer was here, he'd tell you that's the most stupid thing you could do...<eos> My lawyer would tell me that, would he?<eos> Yes, he would.
We shall return to policy.<eos> Sir.<eos> The ex-Emperor will be at Waterloo by morning.<eos> He must be met and welcomed.<eos> Someone's an early bird.<eos> Yes.<eos> I've been awake since dawn.<eos> I came down in search of a glass of milk.<eos> There's milk in the refrigerator, Sir, unless you'd like a cup of tea.<eos> Actually, I would.
Dr. Stewart, what... what happens to a guy from this?<eos> Individuals with prefrontal injury show, among other things, a tendency towards aggression.<eos> Why is that?<eos> We don't know exactly... research in this area is very new... but it's become clear in the past 20 years that prefrontal injury correlates very highly with disinhibition.<eos> Disinhibition?<eos> The inability to constrain impulsive outbursts.<eos> You can't help yourself.<eos> Yes.<eos> Would you say that brain damage stems from his playing football?<eos> I would. Yes.
And our viewing audience straight on a few things.<eos> First of all, my title, "Sassy weather girl,"<eos> Is inaccurate.<eos> I am not a girl.<eos> I am a woman.<eos> And I really hate the word "Sassy."<eos> It's stupid.<eos> - Uh, go in tight on Dale.<eos> - I mean, yes, I have an attitude,<eos> But wouldn't you,
Dead.<eos> I panicked.<eos> I couldn't figure out how to pack you up and ship you to Cleveland with the rest of my stuff.<eos> You try Pack-N-Ship on Third?<eos> They have great rates.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Who wouldn't?
They met at Oxford.<eos> New College. Isn't that right?<eos> What does it matter to you where I met anyone?<eos> Where did you meet, on campus?<eos> Where they met?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know that.<eos> I don't know where exactly it was.<eos> We met at the White Horse on Wheatley Road. You know it?<eos> I don't recall.<eos> You would.
You mean like he's Mick Jagger and we're a bunch of roadies?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We made that motherfucker.<eos> I'd like to be in business with you.<eos> - That I might regret.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> 'Cause I've been ripped off before.<eos> That wouldn't happen with me.<eos> - No?<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
Seems to be telling the truth.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think you had better leave, right now, Mr. Jane.<eos> I don't have the... The time or the patience for tomfoolery.<eos> So you think he's guilty.<eos> I'm wasting my time.<eos> We're done talking.<eos> Suppose I can prove he was innocent? Wouldn't you want that?<eos> Wouldn't you want that blot on your name expunged?<eos> - Of course he would.
- Thank you.<eos> All right, so.<eos> But...<eos> I'm meeting Danielle at Jim and Ellen's Locker, so I'll see you.<eos> Wait. Did I blow out the candle?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.<eos> Mr. Brooks.<eos> I'm glad I caught you. Did you want a classroom phone directory?<eos> Yes, I would.
Lucky no one else was betting.<eos> You'd have to cover them.<eos> It's only money.<eos> Well, if you like to play cards, I have a friend.<eos> He holds a private game every week, and we are playing tonight.<eos> Really?<eos> What are, uh-What are the stakes?<eos> The buy-in is half a million U.S.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to join us tonight.<eos> Perhaps you would too.
Oh, look.<eos> He's come to save the village.<eos> How noble.<eos> What are you going to do, Hood? Hmm?<eos> Are you going to kill me?<eos> Going to shoot me?<eos> And risk bringing down the wrath of Prince John on Nottingham?<eos> Well, I don't think you want that, do you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
A new book... The Book of Judges.<eos> About what?<eos> Oh, I stopped reading his material a long time ago... but I can get you the manuscript.<eos> Gideon ever have a problem with footwear?<eos> What if we're wrong?<eos> Do you ever start a conversation at the beginning?<eos> What if Gideon's conscious?<eos> - You mean faking? - Hiding.<eos> It would explain his lack of progress.<eos> Well, so would severe brain trauma.
This dude is crazy.<eos> Is that possible, Joanne?<eos> Theoretically.<eos> (Eric) Yeah, the H.A.R.T facility is real.<eos> Hey, it's really far away.<eos> (Joanne) It's in Alaska.<eos> The university has a high altitude array.<eos> (Eric) It's a smaller facility but it's similar to H.A.R.T.<eos> I just need to know if something like that would work.<eos> Well, would it?
- He doesn't like cops.<eos> - And what are you, a fed?<eos> - I'll take that as a yes.<eos> - Lieutenant Platko...<eos> You may not know Jimmy, but your daughter does.<eos> I don't have a daughter.<eos> That's not what Lucy says.<eos> You went to see Lucy?<eos> I wanted her to help me find Jimmy.<eos> She wouldn't.
Dr. Atwell, you've never met the baby's father.<eos> This is Lee Scanlon.<eos> Lee, nice to meet you.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> So... 20 weeks.<eos> First ultrasound.<eos> So big question: Do we want to know the sex of the baby?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No.<eos> I would.
What are you doing?<eos> Nothing... I was, I was watching your back.<eos> Damn it, don't do that again.<eos> I've been hit!<eos> Wait. I'm okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> - You shot yourself.<eos> - What?<eos> No, it didn't hurt. I mean, , it would hurt, right?<eos> Of course it would, man.
I'm already in it.<eos> Hi, I need to check myself in.<eos> For what?<eos> For that.<eos> So we've been dating, what? About a month?<eos> And I just didn't wanna say anything until I knew it was gonna go somewhere, and...<eos> Well, we hit a little speed bump when I first found out that Sam was your baby.<eos> Yeah, he got drunk and asked me to sell him on the black market.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She wouldn't, but...
Even yourself.<eos> Sorry. I was just thinking out loud.<eos> What?<eos> I wasn't listening.<eos> What's his name?<eos> - Dan.<eos> - Dan.<eos> Can I meet him?<eos> - If you like.<eos> - I would.
He wasn't wired that way.<eos> Who knows what anyone is really capable of?<eos> We didn't find a note for you, his family.<eos> Often, people want to say goodbye.<eos> Did he leave a message here? A text or...?<eos> Not that I'm aware of.<eos> Oh, we...found this.<eos> I wouldn't read too much into that, Inspector. It's a family heirloom.<eos> Tom's father was a priest in some godforsaken parish up near Carlisle.<eos> Well, why would he...?
-Leonard said no.<eos> -They didn't really want me in it.<eos> -They wanted you in it.<eos> -No! -And I said, "Leonard..."<eos> -No, no, no. I remember where we were.<eos> In the parking lot at Paramount.<eos> I said, "You gotta be in it." He said, "I'm not gonna be in it."<eos> I said, "Leonard," I grabbed him by the shoulder,<eos> "You gotta be in it." "I'm not gonna be in it."<eos> -He would not...
Estuarda, if you wanted I could take care of you.<eos> Look after me?<eos> What, are you asking me to marry you?<eos> Well, look, just as you say, yes.<eos> I'd save you from this and you'll lack for nothing.<eos> And we would finish what we started growing up together.<eos> Sátur, you never change, you do not change; you still have the same birdbrained dreams in your head.<eos> Is that bad?<eos> Estuarda, in recent years a single night has not passed that I do not think of you.<eos> If you would, I...
Vance?<eos> Mossad? You jeopardized your entire career, and for what?<eos> For you.<eos> He was playing you, Ziva.<eos> For some reason, you felt it was your job to protect me?<eos> I did what I had to do.<eos> You killed him.<eos> If I hadn't, you'd be having this conversation with him.<eos> But maybe that's the way you'd prefer it.<eos> Perhaps I would!
Okay.<eos> My brain just popped a little bit.<eos> So when I said our days are numbered on the cot, well, all I was saying was...<eos> - Eddie.<eos> - All I was saying is that maybe we could be more of a thing, that's all.<eos> I could meet your kid. We don't have to keep hiding all the time.<eos> It'd be nice for a change, huh?<eos> Yeah, it would.<eos> Jackie, Mr. Everett's in the OR and I feel like if we had done more than give him clean clothes and a meal tray the last time, maybe he would still have his foot.<eos> He wouldn't.
The new CPPCC is about to commence.<eos> It won't be complete without her.<eos> Men like us won't know how to talk to her.<eos> Send a female comrade to escort her here.<eos> Enlai, we'll burden Yingchao with the task.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Madam Zhou to escort Madam Sun.<eos> I'll tell her right away.<eos> To form a coalition government without you is something the Party will never agree to.<eos> Neither would the rest of the country.
would you yes?<eos> I like that.<eos> Ashl's made a commitment not to date in high school.<eos> I don't wa to go out with her.<eos> I just want to marry her and have children. In that order.<eos> Whoa, okay there, buddy.<eos> no no no? You'reot getting anywhere near her.<eos> I didn't say I was going to.<eos> I just- - I wanted to.<eos> but Who wouldn't?
Yeah, but he's Welsh.<eos> I mean, he'll rewire your house, but he'll shag all your pets.<eos> (LAUGHTER) Hey, you'd have been better off learning a trade while you were in.<eos> I did, I'm a machine gunner.<eos> Plenty of work for you in Longsight, then.<eos> (LAUGHTER) It's all right for you, Taff.<eos> At least you got invalided out with a proper injury.<eos> It really softens the blow, like(!<eos> ) So, if you lot were still serving, would any of you go out there again?<eos> Course I would.
He pretended to be calling for you, and then he started on me about your contract.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your contract, Don.<eos> It was very uncomfortable.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - I'm calling him.<eos> - Don't.<eos> Betts, don't worry about my job.<eos> Why would I?
I recently have rolled up my welcome mat.<eos> Peace.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Please, what?<eos> Please, may I be a part of your family?<eos> Take a walk.<eos> Take a walk!<eos> I would love that.<eos> I would-- Sit down.<eos> I really would.
Sorry.<eos> New mom.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Oh, um, I wanted to ask you, you know that dance this weekend?<eos> The... formal?<eos> Perry and I thought it might be fun to, you know, make a whole night of it.<eos> Like, we'd rent a limo and go to breakfast in the morning and...<eos> The whole night?<eos> Where would you sleep?<eos> We wouldn't.
But the cops already took the tape from the day.<eos> I'm not interested in the tape.<eos> Can I move now?<eos> Exactly two steps to your right.<eos> That guy's a lot smarter than Lassie gave him credit for.<eos> Check it out.<eos> What?<eos> He knew exactly where to stand so that surveillance camera wouldn't pick him up.<eos> Why would someone so intelligent carelessly drop their motel room key?<eos> They wouldn't...
- I am finally appreciating-- - Now you're into basketball?<eos> - After i leave? - But now i've got some girlfriends that are--<eos> They are into it and we're going on thursday night,<eos> - Going to the game.<eos> - Really? I was actually thinking About going to that game.<eos> I was gonna buy scalper's tickets. - Oh.<eos> - Maybe i'll run into you.<eos> - I'm sure you will.<eos> Why wouldn't you?<eos> - Why wouldn't i? Yeah.
Would you excuse me for a second?<eos> Hey, that branch in Florida?<eos> I think I found our man.<eos> No, no, no! You can't send Terrence to Florida.<eos> You should take it as a compliment.<eos> You trained him well.<eos> Exactly!<eos> You can't send him away!<eos> What if you need him here?<eos> Why would I?
You have a nasal whistle when you breathe.<eos> Probably caused by a perforated septum.<eos> I think you're derailing our session to avoid dealing with the issue.<eos> You won't get better if you won't engage with the problem.<eos> At the end of the day, that's all that counts.<eos> It doesn't make a difference to me.<eos> I can sit here all day.<eos> I can't.<eos> Would it help you if I told you that you weren't running from me but from yourself?<eos> No, it wouldn't.
Yeah, guy worked alone.<eos> He never had time for any friends.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Max told me that being alone at Christmas means that nobody loves you.<eos> She's burying her son, alone, on Christmas.<eos> - I think that's heartbreaking.<eos> - You know, when I say "heartbreaking," you say that the heart is a muscle, so it can't break, it can only get crushed.<eos> Isn't it heart-crushing?<eos> - You want to go to his funeral?<eos> I would.
- That was the point.<eos> So, what was the actual score?<eos> You didn't even look this week.<eos> You don't know that you won?<eos> We got you baked when you were 8.<eos> That's why you're dumb.<eos> Shh. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> I hate that thing.<eos> I hate it with all my heart.<eos> I would too.
OK.<eos> Jessica, would you make sure that Jack gets something to eat?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What do we do?<eos> There's nothing we can do.<eos> We just gotta wait him out.<eos> You think he'll ever come back?<eos> Would you?
I wanna talk about something else.<eos> What would you like to talk about then?<eos> How's your daughter?<eos> Rosie?<eos> She's...<eos> She's fine, thank you.<eos> Is she still with that fucked-up guy?<eos> Do you really want to talk about my daughter or are you just trying to make me uncomfortable?<eos> I don't wanna talk about her if you don't.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
Gets worse and worse.<eos> Welcome to the North/South divide, sir.<eos> Well, I'm just about to have me dinner.<eos> Can either wait there, or wait in.<eos> I'm shocked. Shocked.<eos> I am. I'm shocked.<eos> I am.<eos> We were with him last night!<eos> Who'd want to do Gunter?<eos> Naebody. Why would they?
What's wrong?<eos> Did they do something to you?<eos> I'd like to go to my room now.<eos> - Eva. - Please.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Nothing, I can assure you.<eos> How dare you treat my daughter like a common criminal?<eos> Your daughter has been stealing from your home like a common criminal.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> She would never...
You sent him to prison because he killed that 10-year-old boy,Michael wilkins.<eos> Only he escaped, And i think that he wants to hurt other children, Or you.<eos> Melinda, i'm fine.<eos> I've put a lot of people in jail, And none of them have come after me.<eos> What got you on to all of this?<eos> A ghost... Sent me the case.<eos> At first, i thought it was michael.<eos> Lots of other ghosts have tried to stop me.<eos> Does this make any sense to you?<eos> Why on earth would it?
Look, I've saved more people in the last five months than we save in a year.<eos> That what ruby wants you to think?<eos> Kind of like the way she tricked you into using your powers?<eos> Slippery slope,brother.<eos> Just wait and see.<eos> Because it's gonna get darker and darker, and god knows where it ends.<eos> I'm not gonna let it go too far.<eos> It's already gone too far,sam.<eos> If I didn't know you i would want to hunt you.<eos> And so would other hunters.
Whoa, Portland's got a fun little waterfront.<eos> Do you mind if I close this window shade?<eos> I'm trying to adopt a baby, but my job is making it impossible because my work self is suffocating my life me.<eos> I'm Liz Lemon, and I lost my virginity at 25.<eos> I saw the show about following your fear, and it inspired me to wear shorts to work.<eos> It didn't go great.<eos> Do you know Tracy Jordan?<eos> I took a pill earlier, but I didn't get my september issue of O Magazine.<eos> Do you have the number for subscriptions?<eos> Why would you? Blagh!
Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it.<eos> - It just says Creed.<eos> She thought I was Mcnabb.<eos> - I can see that.<eos> - Well, whatcha gonna do?<eos> Another round, boys?<eos> Halpert?<eos> What's up, Roy?<eos> Relax, man. I'm not gonna hit you or anything.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't...
I respect it.<eos> Just a few too many Navy stories in one night.<eos> That's cool with me.<eos> I love a good Navy story.<eos> Oh,the Chargers signed that free-agent linebacker.<eos> You a football fan,Jimmy?<eos> Beause I can get great Chargers seats.<eos> We should go.<eos> I would love that. Yeah.<eos> You would?
Right. Okay.<eos> Why don't you come to bed, bro.<eos> Ohh, I don't think I'll be sleeping inyourbed tonight.<eos> Doesn't really feel right.<eos> I feel like it might be a little bit better for me... if I spent the night on the couch.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's cool. Just make sure you go to the bathroom, okay, before you fall asleep 'cause I don't want you to piss on the couch again.<eos> Oh, well, we, we wouldn't want that now, would we?<eos> No!<eos> We wouldn't.
My stomach. It's killing me.<eos> See? It's something.<eos> Partial small bowel obstruction.<eos> Blockage explains the pain.<eos> What explains the blockage plus seizures?<eos> Atrial fibrillation throwing emboli.<eos> Crohn's causing an abscess.<eos> It could be a million things.<eos> There's no way to know unless we get him in for an MRI on his head, or exploratory surgery so we can biopsy his bowels, which he won't let us do.<eos> Wouldn't.
I really don't think cookies are gonna do it.<eos> You haven't tasted one yet.<eos> Annie, I don't have to. I just...<eos> That's way better than cookies.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Really. You know, if you weren't so freakin' adorable, I wouldn't even be having this conversation right now.<eos> Can we start over?<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> So you want to go out this weekend?<eos> Yes, I would.
And there and there.<eos> I booked us a room.<eos> You booked us a room?<eos> Right.<eos> For us?<eos> Only if you want to.<eos> yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Uh,why wouldn't I?
I have to respect myself.<eos> And more importantly I need you to respect me.<eos> And please. don't tell me you do.<eos> So,this is it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is it.<eos> we're gonna be okay.<eos> How?<eos> I was kind of hoping you would have an answer for that one.<eos> Normally would.
I'll practise my thank-you speech.<eos> Come on, Sasha, don't be a...<eos> What is the problem with George?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Over my head you mean.<eos> Well, George wants to pull out of the film.<eos> And I want to persuade him not.<eos> But I also want to find out why he's suddenly doing this.<eos> Maybe he just doesn't want to be on TV.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
Would you let a woman like that put her foot upon your family, and thank her for it?<eos> No, but...<eos> Then make her pay for it, you naive little mouse!<eos> What else could you do?<eos> You make her pay for it, and do your family some credit!<eos> If you despise me because I'm a dancer, then why did you put me in the way of being one?<eos> It was your doing.<eos> You're the one who chivvied me into taking lessons.<eos> And now... the ground before this Mrs Merdle.<eos> I wouldn't, Fanny.
He was shot in the forehead.<eos> One bullet was enough.<eos> - What time did it happen?<eos> - I'd say 48 hours ago.<eos> Ls that all?<eos> - I was talking about his member...<eos> - Oh, that!<eos> You want to know why he had it out.<eos> - He'd just finished a sexual act.<eos> - So his killer, she'd just...
I think the Soviet people ... had this idea in my head ... that people should survive everything.<eos> As if anyone wanted the party had given him an order ...<eos> -No matter what happens.<eos> Evena lostislandinthenorth ... -in that can not live. -But should<eos> Your home awaits you.<eos> And probably ... second, and now found it funny ... but all dream of a miracle.<eos> And no matter if it will come from above or below, but it will come.<eos> Maybe because ... before all these people ... who were rescued by aircraft at the North Pole ...<eos> Butthatwasimpossible,were atwar,noplaneswerecoming.<eos> There would no planes of the Red Army ... or fleet.
- Mary?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you know how she is?<eos> Are you two are friends?<eos> Look, I'm not the devil, OK?<eos> I'm just a guy with a belief system.<eos> Mary's a nice girl. We save lives together.<eos> That's a good time.<eos> If she wanted to marry my brother, I'd have a problem with that.<eos> But so would a lot of people.
Well, I Know What A Fan You Are Of The Subway System, And There Was That Freaky Third Rail Experience You Had.<eos> Well, My Glasses Were Foggy, But I Do Think I Saw My Nana Down There.<eos> Yeah, Probably.<eos> Anyway, I Thought It Would Be Fun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> What--What-- What's With The Face?<eos> You Don't Wanna Go?<eos> No, No, Of Course I Do.<eos> Who Wouldn't?
Says who?<eos> Your fingerprints.<eos> I did have mine nicked from the car other day. Where did you find it?<eos> I'm going to ask you a really stupid question now.<eos> OK, it flies in the face of every interview technique in the book.<eos> But you're either going to talk to me or not.<eos> Where's Kelly Stevens?<eos> She's the missing schoolgirl, right?<eos> Well, I have no idea where she is.<eos> Why would I?
-Carlos?<eos> -My salsa teacher.<eos> -Ivan's got the push?<eos> -Don't get your hopes up. Just a nudge.<eos> To let him know what he stands to lose.<eos> -And you're planning on staying here, are you?<eos> -Where else am I going to go?<eos> Mum!<eos> The Colonel won't believe us.<eos> But who would?
Young lady, these details are important.<eos> It can't be the fifth.<eos> Maybe the fourth, my periods are very erratic.<eos> You're playing games with the months!<eos> Fourth, fifth... lt's a new offense after the fourth month.<eos> You're not done for abortion.<eos> They get you for murder!<eos> Five to ten years!<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, why would you?
- Worthy of the clothes. - Yeah.<eos> - Someone like me. - Mm.<eos> Someone like...<eos> My daughter.<eos> Well, why not her?<eos> You want your line to represent the waldorf lifestyle.<eos> Who better to represent you than one of your own family?<eos> She was my first dress form.<eos> She'd love to!<eos> I would?
Dad,would you just shut up and listen to him?<eos> Nate.<eos> Look,sir,what exactly do we need to do here?<eos> Remain calm and give them nothing but a united front as we fight this.<eos> Well,what about some sort of,um,some sort of plea?<eos> A plea?<eos> You think i'm guilty?<eos> Dad,it's just a question.<eos> How would that work exactly?<eos> It wouldn't.
I'm gonna put my nuts on the table.<eos> Okay,if you have to.<eos> I'll give you $5 million a year-- on top of what I pay you-- to do all your good works around town,all your little charitable projects.<eos> You--you keep your practice,keep everybody on salary,keep everything as is.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because... I miss your dad.<eos> I miss having that solid citizen by my side to tell me which way is up.<eos> And I trust ya.<eos> I'd have to do it my own way.<eos> Hey,what man wouldn't?
Hi!<eos> It's me.<eos> Siddharth.<eos> I've work with you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> You actually rang that?<eos> Did someone tell you?<eos> No.<eos> Who would?
OKAY.<eos> YOU SEE IT?<eos> CAN YOU SEE IT?<eos> OH, MY GOD.<eos> WHAT DID I TELL YOU?<eos> HOLY COW.<eos> SO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY TO EARL THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE HIM?<eos> "GET THE HELL OUT OF MY DREAM."<eos> DON'T YOU WANT TO GET A LIST OF QUESTIONS TOGETHER?<eos> - I WOULD.
Smith, we need you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, we just conducted an external inspection of the ship with a KH-14 satellite.<eos> And the imaging did confirm the communication antenna's down.<eos> But we already knew that, right?<eos> The satellite also found another problem.<eos> One of their flaps is damaged.<eos> They could lose control on re-entry.<eos> Not could, sir.<eos> Would.
Are you watching me now?<eos> Now, would your husband let me do this?<eos> Well, come on.<eos> Would your husband let me do that?<eos> Please.<eos> Just leave him.<eos> But you can see what I'm saying.<eos> Would he let me do that?<eos> What do you think?<eos> - Yes, he would.
From a single one of your trillion of cells.<eos> So you need something that can store the absolute huge amount of information that it takes to build a creature like a lion, or a human or a tree.<eos> But if life has taken hold elsewhere in our galaxy, or beyond, would these conditions necessarily hold true?<eos> Would extraterrestrial life be water and carbon based?<eos> Would DNA shape intelligent life, and would the aliens look anythink like us?<eos> Maybe they would look a little bit like us, but that would be very, very coincidental.<eos> I mean, I just saw a ground squirrel running behind a bush over here, and he inhabits the same planet I do, probably 70% of his DNA is the same as mine.<eos> He doesn't look like me.<eos> So why would the aliens look like me?<eos> They probably wouldn't.
I don't know.<eos> I don't think you Told us everything.<eos> I think something else happened Inside that arcade, something - something you haven't Told anybody yet.<eos> Mr. Jacobs, have a seat.<eos> did, uh, Jeremy and Katie spend A lot of time together?<eos> our families spend A lot of time together.<eos> he likes his cousin.<eos> Does that Make you jealous?<eos> What?<eos> Why would it?

Could we speed it up?<eos> My time is limited.<eos> - I want to talk to you alone.<eos> - What is this about?<eos> - Sit down and I'll tell you.<eos> - We'd like to know now.<eos> - if this is an interrogation...<eos> - Just some clarifying questions.<eos> He's welcome to a solicitor if he needs one.<eos> Why would I?
This is our fault.<eos> We've let the predators think we're weak.<eos> Has the Department of Homeland Security ruled out terrorism?<eos> It was them Freeman boys.<eos> I'm telling you, you can't trust them new niggas.<eos> Yeah, I said it.<eos> Now, Ruckus, that's crazy.<eos> If they're so innocent, why won't they talk to the police?<eos> What did he say?<eos> Why wouldn't they?
She didn't want to listen.<eos> You know how she was.<eos> I thought of you, PerniIIe and the boys.<eos> I knew it wouId make you sad.<eos> We all loved her.<eos> AII of a sudden she couldn't care less about me.<eos> Or you either. Right?<eos> Sometimes we can't predict the future.<eos> I tried to explain to her that we could forget all about it.<eos> But she wouldn't.
i'm sorry, sweetie.<eos> i don't want to fight tonight.<eos> it's our first weekiversary.<eos> on my suggestion,you... hey, wendy, uh,do me a favor and send a glass of champagne to that pretty young thing over there.<eos> what?<eos> over there.<eos> you.<eos> you're the pretty young thing... is what i meant.<eos> champagne?<eos> would you?
Let's have one of those hugs we've been saving for Mommy.<eos> I'm sorry I shouted at you, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Daddy... - Hmm?<eos> Rosie says that Mommy's asleep.<eos> He carries it around with him in case she phones.<eos> Let's have one of those beers quick before his grandparents get here.<eos> I'd better go, actually.<eos> But you've only just got here.<eos> No, I'd better.
Mommy said she was tired and cold.<eos> She was cold as well.<eos> When the man came to see you this morning, what did he say?<eos> He said I'm a good girl. And he said, "Sorry, Rosie." Barclay:<eos> Rosie, it's time to tell now.<eos> Going, "scrape, scrape, scrapey,"<eos> I cried, and she cried too, and she fell asleep on the floor.<eos> And the next time you woke up, she was gone, wasn't she?<eos> If I played the game with her like she wanted me to, would she still be here?<eos> No, she wouldn't.
What's heroin like?<eos> You ever heard that expression, "Being kissed by God"?<eos> Well, that's just at first.<eos> All you do is you chase it.<eos> You chase that initial feeling when you can never get it back.<eos> You can get the escape when you do get high, but never like the first few times.<eos> I wanna escape.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanna know what it feels like to escape.<eos> No, you wouldn't.

- Oh, no need to.<eos> It was his time to go.<eos> No, I mean about being late.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry about that too, I just...<eos> I mean, about him.<eos> It's all gassed up, Dad.<eos> It's ready to go.<eos> Ah, good.<eos> You sure you want this?<eos> He would.
That is real poetry.<eos> Those are real poets.<eos> Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, the Beatles.<eos> Okay. What if one of your heroes came up to you and said...<eos> You know, Smokey, what if he said:<eos> "Alex Fletcher, you are a horrible songwriter"?<eos> How would you react?<eos> I know Smokey a little bit. He's too nice a gentleman ever to say such a thing.<eos> Dylan might.<eos> Dylan would, actually.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah what?<eos> Yeah to rape. Yeah to murder.<eos> What kind of psychiatrist is she going to?<eos> That's it, you're grounded.<eos> One month.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> -That's not fair. -Who says life's fair?<eos> It wouldn't kill you to stay inside.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it would actually.
I say, isn't it time someone bought another round of drinks?<eos> I'll do this one, Jim.<eos> Same again, everyone?<eos> Ooh, lovely!<eos> Up and down it like a yo-yo, eh?<eos> Mum?<eos> Mother?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Well, if you'd like me to spell it out to you, David.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Never mind.<eos> This morning.<eos> Tell me about this morning.<eos> I got up at 6:30, just like every morning.<eos> Dorothy made me breakfast... oatmeal, one slice of ham.<eos> I kissed the children.<eos> I picked up my briefcase.<eos> You were going to the office?<eos> Of course.<eos> Where else would I...
Reverend Rectus told me to... as your sacred doves are in my head.<eos> But the patriarch is angry.<eos> - He didn't say so.<eos> - What's her name?<eos> - Clytia.<eos> Her name's Clytia.<eos> - They say you're not indifferent to her.<eos> - For her, I'd give my life my eyes, my blood. - I am a woman, too.<eos> - Do you want to see my face?<eos> - Any man would.
But by sunrise,<eos> I'm gonna be gnawing on your bones!<eos> Help me!<eos> Help me!<eos> Well, well.<eos> Are we really gonna leave them?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're being such an asshole.<eos> They would do the exact same thing to us.<eos> Okay, maybe they would, but I wouldn't.
Turn down that road.<eos> What?<eos> I don't know how I know. I just do.<eos> Whoever lives here, I'd say they don't like surprises.<eos> Should we knock?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Hey, Dean.<eos> I'm surprised the cops didn't show<eos> -Place like this you'd think would have an alarm.<eos> Yeah, you would.
Ahhhhh!<eos> You didn't tell me!<eos> I want to eat you, fuck bunny.<eos> How you doing, kiddums?<eos> You had some breakfast? Oh, yeah.<eos> Michelle's does crazy bacon, egg and sausage sandwiches.<eos> They're mad. There! Great!<eos> I'm going... for a shower.<eos> Do you want me to... feed Reuben?<eos> Oh, would you, sweetie?
- Everyone liked and respected Cal Howard.<eos> All these itineraries, people keeping secrets, even from their spouses...<eos> I understand you have to ask these questions, but Cal and Jean Marie were a solid couple.<eos> - Did you ever get drunk together?<eos> - What? What my partner is trying to ask is if you two were buddies.<eos> Did you have drinks, exchange confidences?<eos> - Yes, that's what I asked.<eos> - Yeah, sure, of course.<eos> At times. - You'd know if his marriage was in trouble.<eos> - Yes, sir, I would.
Watching a movie in bed.<eos> What?<eos> Do we really want a TV in the bedroom?<eos> I thought we did.<eos> I'm not sure that we do.<eos> Well, where else would we put my TV?<eos> We could just put it in our storage unit in the basement.<eos> But wouldn't we miss my TV?<eos> - Would we?<eos> - Yes, we would.
And if they won't give me my job back and they won't give you my pension...<eos> Gail, honey, you're gonna need money.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I... that... that's all I can do. I...<eos> That's as far as I can go.<eos> I don't have... access to that part of the system.<eos> To the root directory?<eos> You don't have access to the root directory?<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Who would?
But baby frank is still my brother's kid.<eos> If it gets us past this,I'll give you them two construction jobs you were whining about.<eos> Give me?<eos> They were mine to begin with.<eos> This isn't about jobs.You put down one of my guys.<eos> I did not put him down.<eos> My nephew did, yeah, sure. But it wasn't any kind of move on you.<eos> You don't want to go to war over pete mcgonagle.<eos> I don't want to go to war over pete mcgonagle.<eos> Michael caffee would, yeah, sure.
I would like to buy a hamburger.<eos> I would like to buy a hamburger.<eos> I would like to buy a hamburger.<eos> I would like to buy... a hamburger.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Let's break it down.<eos> I.<eos> - I.<eos> - I.<eos> - Would.

Uh-uh!<eos> Freakin' fantastic!<eos> Don't you see?<eos> None of us has to run away or turn ourselves in.<eos> What do you propose?<eos> We roam the country like Bonnie and Clyde... and Clyde? No.<eos> First, we take the cop's car and crash it into a tree up the road.<eos> We put him and the reverend's wife in her car and push it over the cliff at Grouse Point.<eos> - They'd find the car in a couple of days.<eos> - And what would the forensic figure?
Jeff, if you try to move your wife, she will die.<eos> I can have an ambulance here in four minutes.<eos> Would you like to take your wife out of here tonight?<eos> Would you like to take her to safety?<eos> Stay.<eos> Stand and face me, Jeff.<eos> - Stay with me, please.<eos> - Right now.<eos> Would you like to get your life back?<eos> Would you, Jeff?
Retype it, please.<eos> Of course, Mr Brady.<eos> - Ian.<eos> - Maureen.<eos> So, where's the father?<eos> In the Tap Room in the Steelworks' with his old man, I'll bet.<eos> No, Dave's come over all responsible since she was born.<eos> You wouldn't believe it.<eos> You're right.<eos> I wouldn't.
Six years ago, I find out I inherited the Philadelphia chromosome.<eos> Ran on my mother's side of the family.<eos> I never knew.<eos> Screwed by genetics.<eos> First time, I was panicked the baby would be bipolar.<eos> I'm not so sure I've changed that much.<eos> The chances are slim, you know that.<eos> Crossing the street is a risk.<eos> If you let it get to you, you'd never have children.<eos> Nobody would.
It should fare very well around her.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> See ya, Ted.<eos> Bye.<eos> Now, do you guys have any specific goals or issues that you want to work on?<eos> Or is this just an ordinary, everyday relationship tune-up?<eos> Uh, no, it's not a tune-up.<eos> Um, we've been going at each other pretty good for a while now and we probably should have come months ago.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Oh, she wouldn't...
It's a nice round number.<eos> 10 dollars.<eos> Then everyone would be happier.<eos> You always say that.<eos> Who is everyone?<eos> Me.<eos> Me.<eos> You want me to reach in here and take out 3 pennies?<eos> - Would you mind?<eos> - Yes, I would.
It's faster.<eos> Oh, right, because you know so much about driving inland.<eos> When was the last time your parent's $80,000 SUV was east of South Coast Plaza?<eos> The Cohens are my guardians, not my parents.<eos> I grew up in Chino.<eos> Dad's in prison, my mom... couldn't make it work.<eos> I just knew there was something about you that didn't quite fit in.<eos> In a good way.<eos> I wonder if your dad knows my Uncle Jack.<eos> Why would he?
(Lip) I loved it.<eos> She's amazing.<eos> Even the crying didn't bother me.<eos> You want to try it every night.<eos> Let me, then.<eos> Let me have her more often.<eos> Weekends.<eos> I want to.<eos> You don't.<eos> You wouldn't.
Someone with Unit experience makes mid six figures in the private sector.<eos> Well. - Good for you and Andrew.<eos> - That's why we're starting our own company.<eos> We've got contracts in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. And we're looking for men to fill them.<eos> Unit men.<eos> Pays $300,000 a year to start, and two months vacation time.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> They can all opt out of the Unit tomorrow if they want- well, except for Bob- and come work with us.<eos> Mack wouldn't know what to do with a hundred-dollar bill if you gave him a slide show on it.<eos> But we would, wouldn't we?
That's the law.<eos> Actually I can't stand the IRS, they're evil...<eos> Do You have any fear of IRS?<eos> - Uhm... not really. 'Cause I'm Canadian.<eos> I think it's actually unconstitutional, is what I've heard.<eos> But... ehm... but to avoid any hassle, I pay it.<eos> If there was none law and I wasn't afraid of them coming and taking me to jail, absolutely I wouldn't pay taxes.<eos> OK then no, I wouldn't pay income taxes.<eos> - Ahmm... - It's a no brainer, you wouldn't pay it. I wouldn't pay it.<eos> Why would anybody?
They have 30,000 members worldwide.<eos> They deal drugs, run guns.<eos> They also hire themselves out as hit men.<eos> Which is what 2 of their members were allegedly doing a year ago, when they mistakenly shot a Private First Class...<eos> Martin Reggie.<eos> A Marine from First Sergeant Downing's Company.<eos> - We couldn't prove it.<eos> - Downing was on a revenge mission.<eos> First Sergeants don't go on revenge missions, Officer David.<eos> I would. Why not a Marine First Sergeant?
-You're always so busy<eos> - So busy I don't need to know when my dad's got cancer?<eos> Jane I'm not going to argue with you on the phone<eos> Silly cow!<eos> Maybe four months ago we might have done something.<eos> Mr Tennison assumed the pain was his ulcer and let it go on<eos> Now the tumour's at a stage<eos> We're doing everything we can.<eos> Well, obviously I'll want a second opinion.<eos> I would, too.
So Jim told you?<eos> Who told you then, Brenda?<eos> No one told me, Larry.<eos> I watched her getting her mail, this morning.<eos> You watched her, getting her mail and I could just tell.<eos> She had... an aura about her.<eos> - An aura.<eos> - She glowed, with a radiance, like...<eos> You wouldn't know anything about it, would you, Larry?<eos> Would you?
Alan?<eos> We had a little breakthrough,<eos> Barney and I.<eos> We think we can get it under control.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Well, then why haven't I heard that from Barney?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I thought he would have called you.<eos> He told you we were here?<eos> Why wouldn't he?
Carl, can you tell us about the events you witnessed at the kwikmart on june 21, 2003?<eos> It was really hot, so I stopped to get a soda.<eos> And then this really tall guy came in,<eos> I mean, like, way over 6 feet easy.<eos> And he was wearing a red bandana on his face.<eos> At first, I didn't know what he was doing, but then he pulled a gun.<eos> And he shouted at us to all lie down and not look at him.<eos> And, uh... the husband and wife that owned the store, koreans, they were behind the counter.<eos> And the robber guy yelled at them to open the register.<eos> But the husband wouldn't.
Just get cruel, Mike.<eos> I would like that rat's head on a platter.<eos> You mean, kill it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you have one job now and you have one job only.<eos> He will handle the murder investigation.<eos> I will take care of the robbery.<eos> And you will get the rat.<eos> We'd love to believe you, Brad.<eos> We really would.
Maybe they are making poison!<eos> How's that even possible?<eos> !<eos> And so, I distanced myself from other people in my life.<eos> Is this seat taken?<eos> Eh?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> Why did you take my picture in the pedestrian crossing?<eos> You noticed?<eos> Usually people would.
That's eighth grade, you dork.<eos> I don't know, it's...<eos> Sometimes I wake up on Fridays, and I...<eos> I go to grab my leather jacket, you know?<eos> I'm sure it'll make my dad happy if I go.<eos> He's only called up a zillion times tonight, trying to convince me.<eos> And, uh... I guess...<eos> you want me to go too?<eos> I just told you I did.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
It's almost like his case is a film noir, but he isn't.<eos> I don't think you even know which side you're on.<eos> I don't know which side anybody's on.<eos> I don't even know who's playing today.<eos> Whereas a true film noir protagonist is drawn into all that.<eos> Look at Out of the Past, which is also a private eye story, but Robert Mitchum's character in that isn't Philip Marlowe.<eos> He doesn't stay out.<eos> Yeah, he succumbs to the temptation and gets involved with Jane Greer...<eos> - Did you miss me?<eos> - No more than I would my eyes.
What is the point of belonging to the Extras Guild if I cannot get health coverage for my foot, hmm?<eos> Ew.<eos> Oh, God, Jenna.<eos> I told you, don't listen to rumors.<eos> But Frank and Toofer said to me...<eos> Frank and Toofer?<eos> That's where you're getting your information?<eos> They're messing with you.<eos> No, they wouldn't do that to me.<eos> Yeah, they would.
It wasn't designed to deal with this.<eos> I don't think we'll have to deal with it much longer.<eos> Look, Neil, we can, we can work this out.<eos> Just help us to end the siege.<eos> We've gone way beyond that, Adam.<eos> This could escalate into something horrific.<eos> We live in a horrific world.<eos> You think this is what Rachel would want?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
"The murderer fled," the last line says.<eos> Gauguin didn't need chapter and verse spelling out.<eos> He was the murderer of their great project.<eos> That night he spent in a hotel.<eos> When he got back in the morning, there were police all over the front of the house and a lot of blood inside.<eos> It didn't take long for the story to get told.<eos> Around midnight, Vincent had shown up at his favourite brothel, handed one of the girls, Rachel, a small package.<eos> Inside was a large piece of ear.<eos> The girl fainted.<eos> Well, we all would, wouldn't we?
I want to serve my time. I have nine more years here.<eos> It's a long time, but since I served all those years inside... it's gonna be a lot easier out here.<eos> I'm getting rid of all those things... that I had, you know?<eos> Because of the space I have here.<eos> If it was inside, it's too many people together.<eos> I saw the front and the back.<eos> I wouldn't live there.<eos> I would've gone away.<eos> Would you like to come inside and see my room?<eos> - Yes, we would.
Having trouble sleeping, Mr. Sloane?<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> You'd have to count a lot of sheep to erase today's proceedings, that's for sure.<eos> I'm guessing they're gonna put you away for a long time... which is just too bad, really, because... it'll be awful hard to help that daughter of yours from inside a federal penitentiary.<eos> Of course, it doesn't have to be that way.<eos> Huh, Mr. Sloane? I work for some very powerful people.<eos> My benefactors may be able to help sway the committee's decision tomorrow.<eos> I see.<eos> And I suppose that these benefactors of yours want something in return for their help.<eos> They would at that.
As it turns out, you're not my type.<eos> Although i admit to liking a fiery woman, you're a little on the bossy side.<eos> If you've got something private to say to me, you'd best get to it.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> All right. So, uh...<eos> Someone called my attorney saying i've made harassing phone calls, including one to a detective and that the police were looking for me and since i didn't want to end up, you know, dead,<eos> I thought i'd save you the trouble and turn myself in.<eos> What makes you think you'd end up dead?<eos> Flynn framed me for murder 3 years ago with deputy D.A. Powell and Dr. Easton, so clearly, i'd say, they'd feel better if i ceased to exist.<eos> Maybe i would, too.
Big mousy, Little mousy, Payaso. "Clown"? These were not veteranos,<eos> They were in the middle management of the E/S 14, Which means "East Side Catorce."<eos> It's a latino gang,<eos> And they claim the blocks from 14th street Up to Wilshire Boulevard.<eos> MacArthur Park is where their turf Overlaps into another gang, L.A. Jokers.<eos> Now, both gangs are similar.<eos> The both deal coke, rock, and H.<eos> Most recently, they both branched out into firearms.<eos> So they'd have no trouble getting a gun?<eos> No, no one would.
The whole time i've been here, you've never said one complimentary thing about or to me.<eos> Chief, you have really great legs.<eos> Lieutenant Flynn. Fill out the conclusion section.<eos> Let's have that out to the D.A.'s office. Make the charges murder one.<eos> And, sergeant Gabriel, if you could, uh, walk the boxes over to their offices.<eos> And then, i think it might be appropriate, well, chief Pope tells me that sometimes, at the conclusion of a successful case, y'all gather at O'Malley's to celebrate.<eos> And i thought, under the circumstances, I'd...<eos> I'd like to buy y'all drinks.<eos> If... you're available.<eos> And would like.
Who?<eos> That guy.<eos> What a mess.<eos> All melted of flesh, but even so, enough will to keep walking.<eos> Body ruined, but still desperate to live.<eos> And he's alive.<eos> Yeah, I wonder if I... If I were hurt like that...<eos> If you'd keep on walking?<eos> If anyone would know who I was.<eos> I would.
At least I don't have to be afraid anymore, because that day is here.<eos> - It hurts like hell, but it's almost a relief. - John.<eos> I'm gonna give you what you want.<eos> You can have your divorce.<eos> I don't know if that's what I want. I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> It's okay.<eos> But there's only one thing.<eos> - I don't want you to take Charlie away.<eos> - I would never.
Is there any other way?<eos> The alternative is a gamma or cyberknife treatment with focus radiation.<eos> It's less evasive. There's little chance of memory loss or him losing himself, but it would only give Jorge maybe three to five years.<eos> Three to five years?<eos> This is an incredibly difficult decision.<eos> If you have any more questions or you need to talk to me, I'm here, okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> I told my mother about you.<eos> She remembers you very well.<eos> Of course she would.
- N-A-N.<eos> Nan.<eos> Mom...<eos> Hey, Bridgette...<eos> Yes, you can talk.<eos> Anyone can talk whenever they want to.<eos> It just... it isn't polite to talk when someone is reading.<eos> I want to walk home from school.<eos> Well, why would you want to do that?<eos> Why wouldn't I?
Preaching Pete, eh? Could no more cope with the idea of failure than he could second sight.<eos> You two still planning to baptise this one?<eos> That church is going to be full one day.<eos> A baptism's not a bad way to start.<eos> No.<eos> HORN<eos> Looks like you'll be needing this.<eos> Mal.<eos> I knew you'd be here.<eos> Oh, yes. Of course. You would.
He wanted us looking for his body instead of him.<eos> We'd have done it, too, if Abby hadn't found the hinky blood trail.<eos> I gotta meet this woman.<eos> You know what, she's probably not your type tats, piercings, dark makeup...<eos> Goth?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I love Goth.<eos> Thieves are just like gamblers.<eos> They never quit when they're ahead.<eos> Why would Petty Officer Lambert?
Mughda, Mughda Das.<eos> You would do.<eos> She runs a restaurant in Southall.<eos> No, no, no, I hate curry.<eos> No.<eos> - I know her, ´cause she came into my office.<eos> - Eight years ago.<eos> - You can remember a face after eight years?<eos> Look at it.<eos> You would, wouldn´t you? Eh?
Okay, good<eos> What was your favorite part?<eos> The locker room/ The shower scene/ The orgasm in the deli<eos> Okay, well, if I'm gonna check with everybody in the city, I better get going!<eos> So--so Jack works for a network?<eos> You know, I've got a script that I've been working on<eos> You think there's any way, maybe, you could pass it along to him?<eos> I mean, you know, only if you like it, of course<eos> - You want me to read it?<eos> - Yeah, if you would
Is he just a swell guy who wants to help the black man?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> Charlie hates blacks.<eos> He hates Jews. He even hates women.<eos> He once told me that women were slaves with no souls.<eos> No, whatever it is, it ain, t for the benefit of mankind.<eos> - It, s for the benefit of Charlie.<eos> - How? How does it benefit him?<eos> - I don, t know.<eos> - Who would?
It's not about economics.<eos> It's about health.<eos> The McDonald's Texas home-style burger meal.<eos> That's a... that's a local specialty.<eos> So it's kind of like a big 'n' tasty?<eos> Yes, except the big 'n' tasty comes with mayonnaise.<eos> Oh, then, you know what?<eos> I need the McDonald's Texas homestyle burger meal, please.<eos> Would you like to super-size it today?<eos> Oh, yes, I would.
I just did it in... seven hours and 26 minutes.<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> Go back to being radiant.<eos> The golden ratio.<eos> - The golden ratio--<eos> - You're about to say the ratio of 1.618-1 has been proven to be the key to everything in nature that we find beautiful and that my face is the most perfect example you've ever seen of that ratio.<eos> How could you possibly know that?<eos> Because every geek I've ever met has tried to hand me that line.<eos> I'd love for you to join us in the cabin, see the sunrise over the Amazon.<eos> Of course you would.

Does she know about your massacre?<eos> I know he has killed some Niratta bandits.<eos> By the way you sound,<eos> I suspect that Ahimsaka didn't abduct you, unlike what Brahmin Sati has said.<eos> She still has her chastity.<eos> I believe your words.<eos> But Brahmin Sati is hunting you high and low.<eos> He wants to save his wife.<eos> He wants me back?<eos> Why wouldn't he?
Rhade.<eos> Thank god you're safe.<eos> You have to go.<eos> Your place is with your crew.<eos> Mine is here.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Bring your people.<eos> They can stay on theAndromeda.<eos> No.<eos> Would theAndromedahave room for all the citizens of the Arkology?
Phone.<eos> - Phone.<eos> - Oh, phone.<eos> You're good.<eos> Hello?<eos> Darryl, now is not really a good time again.<eos> Let me call you back?<eos> All right.<eos> Not that I'm okay with you stealing my stuff, but those earrings really do look amazing on you.<eos> Then again, what wouldn't?
One mississippi.<eos> Two mississippi...<eos> For most kids, the fun of the game isn't in the hiding.<eos> The fun is in being found.<eos> But not for me.<eos> I didn't want to be found.<eos> Here I come! Ever.<eos> Got you.<eos> They'll never find me.<eos> And they never would.
- We're wonderful.<eos> Thank you for asking.<eos> Rory, we're sorry to bother you at school... but next Friday, your grandfather and I agreed... to host a little Yale alumni event at our house.<eos> It completely slipped our minds the other night.<eos> So we'll have to cancel our usual Friday-night dinner.<eos> Oh. That's okay.<eos> However, we were wondering if maybe you'd like to come.<eos> Me?<eos> The alumni like to meet the new generation of Elis... and, plus, we'd love to be able to show you off... to all our friends, wouldn't we, Emily?<eos> - Yes, we would.
No ice, thank you.<eos> - What were you doing in Hong Kong?<eos> - Making money... seeing which way the wind would blow once the Chinese took it back.<eos> - Which way is it blowing?<eos> - Back to London.<eos> What about you?<eos> What do you do, apart from panic in lifts?<eos> - You don't know who I am?<eos> - Should I?<eos> Every other person in here would.
Yeah? I've never met a proper photographer before.<eos> Sure.<eos> It's true. There's paparazzi camped outside Dad's clubs, but I never met one that did trees.<eos> I'm going to Fine Shade Woods later.<eos> BELL CHIMES Yeah?<eos> Can I watch?<eos> It seems that Deakin had a point.<eos> Sir? Well, there's no record of any chapel being sold to the Manor.<eos> Clifford said the transaction took place before records began.<eos> Well, he would, wouldn't he?
It's not funny, Sean.<eos> I'm sorry, but the picture of those two vain little peas... in their self-absorbed pods pumping away over the desk...<eos> - It's hilarious if you think about it.<eos> - I don't want to think about it.<eos> Come on. Why are you taking this so personally?<eos> My own mother flashed me at the gym... and then she insisted she had a better body than me.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> If she bothers you so much... let's have Christian do her lift and send her packing.<eos> She says there's a conflict of interest now, because she screwed him. She's insisting again that you do it.<eos> Would you?
In part because he has been a very good friend.<eos> And sometimes romance confuses a friendship.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well I can't tell you how to feel in your heart.<eos> It just sucks for Keith, that's all.<eos> Goodnight, mom.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I never thought this many people would actually show up.<eos> Why?<eos> Because why would they?
- Been there?<eos> To the land of the wooden shoes?<eos> No.<eos> I brought you a little present.<eos> Let's sit.<eos> Milk chocolate.<eos> Or perhaps you like dark?<eos> I've got it right here.<eos> You don't have a mousetrap in there, do you?<eos> No. Why would I?
You're not seriously thinking about this?<eos> We're the reason they had to leave their planet.<eos> - This is a complicated situation.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> It means I'm not about to rule anything out at this point.<eos> Dr Weir.<eos> Is it true you've discovered land on this world?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> - My people wish to explore it.<eos> - You would?
These priests can do anything.<eos> You get pregnant out of wedlock? You must be possessed.<eos> Bam!<eos> They tie you down, tie you down and cast the demon out.<eos> I'm just curious...<eos> How exactly would they accomplish this sort of thing?<eos> Someone took all her dreams away.<eos> What was is no more.<eos> I mean, it's not like she wanted to end up sleeping in a barrel.<eos> Who would?
Munitions depot confirmed, but we have two problems.<eos> One, the Ragnar station is at least three days away at best speed.<eos> Two, the entire Cylon fleet is between here and there.<eos> - Specialist.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Bring me our position.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - You don't want to do this.<eos> - I know I don't.<eos> Because any sane man wouldn't.

Is there something you wanted to say?<eos> Father Martin... Something he said.<eos> "God, what have we done?"<eos> Is that what you mean?<eos> You knew.<eos> Yes, he told me.<eos> And you didn't say anything because you were afraid that I might think that father Martin killed the archdeacon.<eos> Do you think father Martin killed the archdeacon?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Then why would I?
He lets me be myself.<eos> I've never been happier, honey.<eos> One, two, three, draw!<eos> I think she got you!<eos> I've just never been happier.<eos> Who do you have to know... to get a little Grey Poupon around here?<eos> Ray!<eos> It's you, in my apartment, making a sandwich.<eos> It wouldn't kill you to keep lettuce in the crisper.<eos> No, it wouldn't, Ray.
- Yes.<eos> Right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Ros?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Do you know, I would really love to talk some more about your philosophy on teaching.<eos> Do you think maybe we could grab some coffee?<eos> You want to go get some coffee with me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really would.
I didn't know it'd be, you know...<eos> Older people?<eos> - That's okay.<eos> - Older than me, say.<eos> Are you a little shy, Oscar?<eos> I think you are.<eos> I think you're very nice, too.<eos> Would you like to come home with me?<eos> I know, I can't believe I said it, either.<eos> But would you?
Okay.<eos> But in terms of us... you just want us to be friends, right?<eos> Honestly? No.<eos> -So what do you wanna be?<eos> -l think I'd embarrass you if I told you.<eos> I was embarrassed just getting dressed to see you.<eos> This may surprise you, but some women consider me quite the guy.<eos> I've never been married. I'm a doctor.<eos> You wouldn't believe what catnip that is for some women.<eos> Yes, I would.
I feel unconditional love.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> Men who say those things are usually called liars.<eos> So that's what you are. A liar.<eos> But I'm not lying.<eos> I'm sure you'll feel unconditional love for me one day.<eos> Are you? - You're sure.<eos> - I'm certain of it.<eos> But I might be gone already.<eos> Why would you?
Prowse:<eos> They've hit bottom, sir.<eos> And each other.<eos> Sir.<eos> Ow!<eos> Uhh!<eos> Uhh...<eos> I've had my share of Prisoners aboard this ship,<eos> So if you wish to die a martyr...<eos> I would.
- All better.<eos> Not all better.<eos> It's not like Dawn hasn't grown up in this house knowing all the rules.<eos> Especially the biggie!<eos> "Do not invite bloodsucking dead people into our home."<eos> I would never have Harmony over even when she was alive. People slip, Buffy.<eos> Your mom did. She invited in the mas...<eos> Dracula in for coffee.<eos> Well, that was different. I mean, she...<eos> He would...
So stuff mostly worked out.<eos> - Giles, are you sure about this?<eos> - Why wouldn't I be? Most magic-shop owners in Sunnydale have the life expectancy of a Spinal Tap drummer.<eos> - And have you ever run a store before?<eos> - I was a librarian for years.<eos> This is the same, except people pay for the things they never return. It'll give me focus, help increase my resources.<eos> Boy, you've really thought this through.<eos> Don't break anything.<eos> Just don't touch anything. Not that Buffy's really changed at all.<eos> Like she ever would.
I forgot I knew that.<eos> -What's wrong with me?<eos> -You cannot feel guilty about that.<eos> My office is calling every five seconds.<eos> It's called life, and we have to deal.<eos> Deal with what, though?<eos> It's not Shakespeare. I'm not writing Schindler's List.<eos> Why do I care? I'm no Spielberg.<eos> The guy won't even meet with me.<eos> -Why would he?
Why should she?<eos> She knows you'll be along any second to do it for her.<eos> Mom, why do you always make everything so hard?<eos> Don't you understand, this is my last night with my daughter!<eos> She goes off to college tomorrow!<eos> I know, which is why I was so surprised you didn't want to spend the evening with her.<eos> - I do!<eos> - Then you should've come!<eos> - I couldn't!<eos> - You wouldn't!
Dan is a kind and gentle man.<eos> He's incapable of violence.<eos> How can I convince you?<eos> Let the police interview him.<eos> For starters, Iet's talk about that 45-minute gap in your alibi.<eos> It was a boring, rubber chicken dinner.<eos> I went to the bar for a drink.<eos> Try again. We checked.<eos> The bartender doesn't remember you.<eos> Well, why would he?
VALET?<eos> HAT CHECK GIRL?<eos> WELL, I...<eos> IT...<eos> IT'S JUST, UM, EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED, WE COULD REALLY USE THE CASH.<eos> I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.<eos> THANKS.<eos> BYE.<eos> BYE.<eos> OOH, UH, WOULD YOU, UH...
What ?<eos> What's the look?<eos> No look.<eos> No look.<eos> You were the one looking at me.<eos> I'm just looking to see why you... Seem like you staring daggers at me all of a sudden.<eos> I wasn't staring daggers at you.<eos> I was looking at you 'cause you were talking.<eos> I don't think Jones would go with you, anyway.<eos> He would.
Dot com.<eos> Ηey, that's not your locker.<eos> You know, you are the spitting image of the Aberdeen StrangIer.<eos> Movin' on.<eos> ♪♪ [ whistling ] I need to see Lisa Simpson's permanent record.<eos> I'm afraid that information is confidential.<eos> These are some nice looking papers on your desk.<eos> It would be a shame if somebody shuffled them.<eos> You wouldn't dare.<eos> Oh, wouldn't I?
That's right, I remember everything.<eos> Everything!<eos> It's all in here, bro, and you ain't getting none of it.<eos> Now, either charge me or let me see my lawyer, government man.<eos> (Radio) 'Target's proceeding through lobby.'<eos> (Danny) Durand and Hastings are on the move.<eos> (Ruth) 'They're selling to the Chinese.<eos> Keep Jean-Luc distracted.'<eos> - He knows we're on to them.<eos> - 'How? ' Because I would.
And tell him to check his teeth.<eos> Is he a friend of yours?<eos> - Could be.<eos> Just tell him.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You may want to check your teeth.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, what about alcohol?<eos> How does it react with Avlocardyl?<eos> It wouldn't.
Ha, ha.<eos> Wait till he steps on this flaming bag of, ah Lisa's college fund?<eos> Sir, we could be in real trouble here.<eos> If the government found out you dumped nuclear waste under Lego Land...<eos> Oh, Smithers, the environmental effects won't be visible for years.<eos> Heh, talk about your runaway government.<eos> For dumping that waste, you could go to jail.<eos> A handsome man like you, I'd hate to think what would happen.<eos> Ha, ha, I wouldn't go to jail.<eos> The legal owner of this plant would, Canary M. Burns.
The fairy poem?<eos> I haven't the foggiest idea.<eos> Do you mean Christabel LaMotte?<eos> Get off the line!<eos> I looked in Ellen's diary.<eos> There's nothing.<eos> But, uh, this should cheer you up.<eos> It's in her correspondence.<eos> I'm not going to ask if this is the original.<eos> I wouldn't.
