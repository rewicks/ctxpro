- Yes, sir.<eos> No.<eos> No, sir.<eos> You know Henry Sharrow well.<eos> I knew him before he were Henry Sharrow.<eos> I knew him when he were a man like other men.<eos> He used to trade with the Indians.<eos> - Gold, I'm told.<eos> - No more than trinkets, sir.<eos> And Henry never asked what the Indians might have told you?

It happens we were discussing this topic yesterday.<eos> My wife is as enthused as I am by the prospect of children.<eos> Then I feel certain you will have news for us soon.<eos> Is that so, Jocelyn?<eos> I'm sure we will discover what the true riches of Virginia prove to be.<eos> Not gold, not tobacco, but the next generation.<eos> The Indians call it bloodlines.<eos> They know why it matters.<eos> Jocelyn, when I write again to my cousin in Oxfordshire I will send her news of pregnancies and births.<eos> She knows you a little.
So you will speak to me, then?<eos> I will.<eos> When's the last time you saw the dawn?<eos> Marshall, sir.<eos> Is it dawn, sir?<eos> You spoke with the governor.<eos> Yes, I did, sir.<eos> Did he ask you about a map?<eos> Do you mean De La Warr's map, sir?<eos> Let me tell you what I know about that, there is no such a diagram.
- Why not?<eos> Well, because he never asked about no map, sir.<eos> What is it that I don't like about you, Rutter, huh?<eos> Perhaps it's me breath, sir.<eos> My wife says it is like a plague of pus.<eos> I could spend hours just thinking of ways to bring you harm.<eos> Farewell, Marshall.<eos> Ma'am, why did Mistress Rutter come in to be master's house?<eos> Did she come into our house?<eos> - I found her. - She said not to tell you.

This gift has been given to us by our dear Lord so that I might influence you, teach you the bliss and the blessing it is for a woman to know her place in this world.<eos> And to accept it.<eos> I just pray that Silas comes home first and you never have to use it.<eos> Let us pray that Silas comes home.<eos> We hope to see you dancing at the celebrations, Mistress Rutter.<eos> I will surely dance, sir.<eos> Governor, I've put together a party of ten militia to search for Henry Sharrow.<eos> If I'd wanted you to set out I'd have spoken to you, Marshall.<eos> Perhaps it is possible Sharrow has De La Warr's map.<eos> Maybe that concerns you.
Perhaps.<eos> What are you doing, Verity?<eos> It's a lovely thing.<eos> I'm looking at it.<eos> Verity, did you intend to take the box?<eos> Why would I do such a thing as that?<eos> Verity, please tell me the truth.<eos> God is our witness here today.<eos> And was God our witness when my pa beat the last breath from me ma's mouth with his mortal fists?<eos> Perhaps God brought me here now so that I might spare you from the gallows.
Lady Yeardley.<eos> Alice, do you know where I might find Mistress Rutter?<eos> I don't know, ma'am. What is it, ma'am?<eos> Lady Yardley.<eos> That is not acceptable.<eos> Where is your wife, Mr Rutter?<eos> My husband knows that the box is missing.<eos> He will realise you have taken it.<eos> Verity, you will not even make it to the gallows.<eos> He'll put a sword through you before you can even speak.

I like my family and all, but I'm just not sure we're all meant to live together.<eos> Maybe things will be better one day, when we all have our own places and only see each other on the holidays.<eos> But right now, this combination of people is just not working.<eos> This is a disaster.<eos> Diaper!<eos> It's a diaper, it's a diaper, it's a diaper!<eos> That's it. My life is over.<eos> It already has 6,000 views.<eos> Congrats, Diaper Hands, you've gone viral.<eos> I'd love to stick around with you losers, but I got to forward this to everyone I know.
Good idea.<eos> We don't want to show up to Meemaw's looking like roadkill.<eos> I'm gonna take Manny back to the van.<eos> The van... that's why we can't find our stuff.<eos> It's still in their van.<eos> Let's go!<eos> - I need to use the bathroom.<eos> - Me, too. Okay.<eos> Keep watch for each other, all right?<eos> Meet you outside.
[Laura] Doris is our pink 29-foot ocean rowing boat.<eos> There's two cabins, one at each end.<eos> The cabins are about the size of a fairly small two-man tent.<eos> We've got solar panels along the top of the boat, and they're connected to our batteries, which are underneath the bit that we sleep on in the cabin.<eos> If we drain those batteries, we've got no way of using our GPS or making water and stuff off the electrics.<eos> So, we need to be really careful and calculated about that.<eos> I tell you what. Spend 48 hours sitting in your own bathtub at home and imagine you've got a lid over it, so, you can't quite sit up straight.<eos> That's pretty much what it's like in the forecabin.<eos> [Isabel] It is breakfast time.<eos> Emma is going to tell you what we have today.
"None of that matters."<eos> So, I was held as a reserve and then Laura called me and said:<eos> "Can you still do it?"<eos> And I was like, "Okay!"<eos> And that was it.<eos> I'll be rowing to Samoa, and then Megan Dyos will take over from me and go to Cairns.<eos> It's just something so far from what I've ever done before or even thought possible.<eos> [Laura] Girls, thanks for making this happen.<eos> For finally being an amazing team.<eos> I'm so proud of all of you.
If someone told me I never had to row again, I would be really happy, and that makes me really sad because... we've still a long way to go, another leg to get to Cairns, and I don't know if I can...<eos> Yeah.<eos> [Tony] Just getting the latest position.<eos> I believe we are about two miles away but I just want to double-check the little dot we're seeing on the horizon is actually them.<eos> There they are, right in the horizon there!<eos> [Laura] We have been battling the currents, the winds.<eos> We were extremely concerned at points that we may have to overshoot Samoa, which was devastating to us that that might have been the case.<eos> And I think the thought of that made us dig even deeper than we thought we could do, and we powered as hard as we could, and we were absolutely--<eos> I think we left everything on the boat, everything on the ocean, just to get here, and I'm so glad we did, because this would have been a devastation to have missed this.<eos> We are very proud to be here and to share this with you.
What she's really needed to do is actually step back and take stock of not only what she's doing but who she is as a person, really, because I think, you know, when the essence of who you are is questioned,<eos> [Laura] Getting to the finish and knowing that you've achieved what you've set out to achieve...<eos> You know, it's four years of hard work.<eos> I mean, to walk away from it any sooner than that, I would just be devastated.<eos> So, to me, Australia is home and nothing ever before that.<eos> [Natalia] That is like a big blooming...<eos> -[Lizanne] Rhino horn. -...rhino horn.<eos> I can't believe I'm leaving.<eos> I can't believe this day has come.<eos> I've built a really special bond with each of you.
I've got what's worth having.<eos> I got your text.<eos> You took a while.<eos> I was taking a sound bath.<eos> What is a...<eos> You know what?<eos> Doesn't matter. What matters is that you're sure that this guy you ate is legitimately a zen'd-out, anti-materialistic, "what's the sound of one hand clapping" kind of guy.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> He's so legit, I don't even have to cultivate mindful self-compassion.<eos> Then this might surprise you.
Harris says he turned his back to get the guy some coffee.<eos> Turned back, he was gone.<eos> If he was ever there to begin with.<eos> I mean cosmically.<eos> Like how none of us are really just here, we're on multiple planes of...<eos> I'm going back to my sound bath.<eos> This is zulu-13.<eos> I'm 20 meters from jackpot, ready to infiltrate.<eos> Got to watch your six, newb.<eos> Lilywhite, along with "right in front of you," what's another place that bad guys might be?
You are the deceased's former business partner.<eos> "Partners"?<eos> Generous. I was kind of the brains of the outfit.<eos> Not enough brains to dodge a coke bust.<eos> "Coke bust." Makes it sound like I was a junkie.<eos> I was moving product.<eos> Much cooler.<eos> You mind?<eos> We know the killer had large feet.<eos> Maybe we can cross you off the list of suspects.
Topher and Devon.<eos> Please. I'm sorry.<eos> Who's Devon?<eos> Uncurl the toes, please.<eos> Twelve.<eos> Open wide.<eos> So Mitch went to jail, and you and Topher struck it rich. What then?<eos> I couldn't understand why I wasn't happy, so I spent my money.<eos> Hoping things, material possessions, hallucinogenics, would bring me peace.<eos> They didn't. So after you spent all your money, Topher got you into all this?
You haven't had any visions.<eos> Name one thing this brain's done to help catch the killer.<eos> Can we get over this fixation of who did what, when?<eos> It's a murder investigation.<eos> Filling with sunlight.<eos> Detective babineaux?<eos> I just got a report from a woman about a pimp yelling at a hooker in a car.<eos> Meaning us?<eos> You have been snippy with me.<eos> Yeah, well, she said she'd been watching you two parked here all night.
You get the bald one.<eos> But I called him.<eos> Hair likes hair, bald likes bald.<eos> Why do you think Cali skins don't fuck Idaho Klan?<eos> - No mixing.<eos> - Both.<eos> What?<eos> All for Helen.<eos> News flash, ladies.<eos> Those boys don't wanna fuck any of you.
Lots of people get phones!<eos> Welcome to the 21st century, bitches.<eos> You got chargers?<eos> We got no power, pendeja.<eos> Use 'em till they die.<eos> Well, that was pretty exciting, huh?<eos> I can't hear you!<eos> Now, hold onto your pants because we got something real special comin' up.<eos> Hey, bring 'em in!<eos> Any of you little bitches let go of that rope, we shoot you in the head.
Are those actual guards?<eos> This all we got?<eos> There's two still locked in the kitchen with those bald bitches.<eos> Too bad...<eos> They're gonna miss all the fun.<eos> Strip search.<eos> You just love yelling shit out, don't you?<eos> How are you holding up, pretty lady?<eos> Uh, where's Dr. DePalma?<eos> He had to run, but we will take very good care of you.
Man, I am not made of stone.<eos> You and me, blondie.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Wait, I thought this was a hypothe...<eos> What was that?<eos> - Oh, fuck. It's a fucking dart! - Well, get it out.<eos> Get it out, man!<eos> There you go.<eos> Motherfuck! Oh!<eos> Hey, nice knowing you, boys.
Somebody knocked me out.<eos> I wake up, and I'm this person who's supposed to have power, and I just fucking shot someone.<eos> Shit, I hate when people cry.<eos> Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay.<eos> We've all pretended to have guns that we don't have.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Sure.<eos> I'll show you how I make everyone think I got a gun.<eos> I'm like a expert.<eos> One thing I know, never let them move you to a second location.

"Mary had a little lamb."<eos> Mary...<eos> Looks like cerebral ischemia.<eos> I need TPA, now.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Sometimes it's best to use what's available on hand.<eos> Like?<eos> Like blowing oxygen bubbles in his IV.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> We're all rooting for you, sir.
Me, too!<eos> - Speak English, you guys.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> So what's wrong with him, anyway?<eos> He's had a stroke.<eos> It's difficult to assess the extent of the damage at this point.<eos> It is?<eos> Well, we're taking him anyway.<eos> Don't try to stop us.<eos> Nobody's stopping you.
I don't need a medal, but a little recognition would be nice.<eos> I mean, the bringer of light should at least get a Twinkie out of it, right?<eos> You know, I told that whole room, "Hey, guess who fixed the power?"<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's a tough fucking crowd.<eos> Got any family out there?<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> So... it took me one whole minute to look this cute.<eos> It only took me 30 seconds to get so pretty for you.
What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> I'm carrying out orders from Governor Hutchinson. And you?<eos> I'm in charge of this place and you're in my fucking way.<eos> Is that how you always speak with women?<eos> No wonder they're rioting.<eos> Explain to me how the governor's plan to de-escalate the situation includes rewarding the inmates with... whatever the hell is in those boxes.<eos> In the future, you should ask instead of demand.<eos> The CERT team cannot guarantee ingress into the prison without casualties.<eos> Governor Hutchinson cares about the lives in there, unlike other people involved.<eos> That's you. I'm talking about you.
Yeah, don't ever do that again.<eos> Ever.<eos> Was that Kanye?<eos> - Do we answer?<eos> - I like her ensemble.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Not too in-your-riot-face, but some flair.<eos> I'm doin' it.<eos> Hello?<eos> How may I help you?
Them snacks you dropped off, though, were delightful.<eos> Truly.<eos> We delighted. - I...<eos> - I'm so glad.<eos> Hi, Nita. I'm sorry about that.<eos> Yes.<eos> This is Taystee.<eos> Put her on speaker. Put her on speaker!<eos> Taystee.<eos> It was nice to meet you in person today.
- Order in the court!<eos> Order in the court! - This is ridiculous!<eos> There's got to be a better way.<eos> Holy fuck, am I gonna be famous.<eos> Okay, this shit is fucking bananas.<eos> Aleida?<eos> Hi. April.<eos> We spoke on the phone.<eos> Let's get you inside.<eos> And we'll get you into makeup.
Aleida?<eos> Hi. April.<eos> We spoke on the phone.<eos> Let's get you inside.<eos> And we'll get you into makeup.<eos> You hear that shit? "Get you into makeup."<eos> Hey, Ape, let me ask you a question.<eos> I get paid for this shit, right?<eos> You think you could give me that grand in cash, up-front? What?<eos> Did someone tell you you were gonna get paid?
Make your answers real long.<eos> You'll sound smarter that way.<eos> And turn your right side to the camera.<eos> That's your pretty side.<eos> And use the news guy's name a lot. Ooh, ooh!<eos> And always answer a question with another question. - Ooh.<eos> - Fifteen seconds.<eos> Look, do me a favor and don't get me fired, okay? Fired?<eos> I'm gonna get your ass a promotion. Aleida, this is Susan.<eos> She'll be interviewing you today.
And then what?<eos> So you'd have another hostage. Whee!<eos> And then, another strike on your record.<eos> You know what you'd be doing, actually?<eos> You'd be staring down the barrel of forever is what you'd be doing up in here.<eos> This is bullshit!<eos> She's not thinking about us.<eos> She was protecting her boyfriend.<eos> No, it's not true. Come on. Hey!<eos> Listen, all I can do is stand up here and tell you how I feel, all right?

Come on. Hey!<eos> Listen, all I can do is stand up here and tell you how I feel, all right?<eos> I'm a person. I'm talking to people.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm just gonna leave you all to it. How about that?
You're wasting your time!<eos> The hell you know?<eos> I know that Poussey wouldn't have wanted a wall of nautical sex motifs or death-themed macaroni art.<eos> She would've wanted something special.<eos> Like hair dolls.<eos> Like everybody coming together to create something beautiful and memorable.<eos> And what would that look like, O visionary warrior?<eos> You want to grunt an actual idea, maybe?<eos> So as you can see, it's, like... way less crowded out here than it is in the dorms.<eos> And also, we have a thriving artistic community, which I know is so important to you gays.
- What is he doin' here?<eos> - Trying to be a hero.<eos> Quick. Create a diversion while I get the fingerprint.<eos> - How?<eos> - You're a woman.<eos> How?<eos> - Use your sexuality.<eos> Fucking Bond villain.<eos> This side feels a bit tender.<eos> - Is that okay for you?
- How?<eos> - You're a woman.<eos> How?<eos> - Use your sexuality.<eos> Fucking Bond villain.<eos> This side feels a bit tender.<eos> - Is that okay for you?<eos> - Yeah, that... that's good.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Can I help you?
- I would knock him down first.<eos> - With what?<eos> I'll tell you with what.<eos> Paint can!<eos> How long you been a reporter? Hmm, couple years.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - It's very brave work.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Officer Moloney.<eos> I'd like a word with you, please. In private.
I'd like a word with you, please. In private.<eos> I thought you left, Officer...<eos> Piscatella.<eos> I would never leave my men.<eos> Listen...<eos> I've been in contact with one of my cos on the inside.<eos> CO Humphrey.<eos> He tells me they are mounting an offensive.<eos> Now, I know a way to breach, undetected...<eos> I'm gonna stop you right there, Officer, uh... uh...
My extra time never went through.<eos> Slow paperwork or some shit.<eos> I could get home while my kid's still pissing in diapers.<eos> So I'm not risking more years to be part of some hope and change bullshit.<eos> It ain't bullshit.<eos> They're negotiating in there.<eos> Ay! Come on.<eos> That yellow brick road ain't leading no place but Max.<eos> The stars, ladies...<eos> I'm telling you.
Yeah, what's the catch?<eos> Thank you, Ms. Figueroa.<eos> I know we're gonna do some real good work here.<eos> Agreed.<eos> But you have to help me help you.<eos> - You're gonna have to give a little.<eos> - See? See? There it is.<eos> - Always a catch.<eos> - As eloquent as these demands are, they completely fail to take into account our current economic climate.<eos> The BOP's private prison budget is restrictive and far too complex for me to explain to you here, but trust me, it definitively prohibits us from meeting all of these demands.
I can't do anything from in here.<eos> You know that.<eos> - Maybe if you let me out...<eos> - What?<eos> And get myself jumped by all those crazy bitches out there?<eos> Unless you can guarantee me that I'm gonna end up in the same ICU as Benny, I don't see what good that's gonna do me.<eos> Please, Mr. Caputo.<eos> Some of us have actually been trying to do good during all this shit.<eos> If you can make it to my office, press three on the office phone.<eos> Maybe somebody there can do something for you.
So, ladies, let me ask you:<eos> What do you think inspired this sudden movement for change inside Litchfield?<eos> Movement?<eos> It's a damn riot.<eos> Well, Meredith, I think this is all happening on the heels of losing one of our young inmates,<eos> Ms. Poussey Washington.<eos> Such an enormous loss.<eos> She was my mentee, you know. I...<eos> Well, more than that, she was my friend.<eos> Judy, I'm sorry. - That must be devastating for you...
This is about all of us.<eos> And what they're doing to us while we in there. And what they ain't doing.<eos> - Mmm.<eos> - We need some education, some rehabilitation, but we ain't getting nothing 'cause they want us to fail out here.<eos> Those prison companies? They want us to keep going back in because we the easiest product for them to restock.<eos> No, no.<eos> Ms. Diaz is right.<eos> Those private prisons are awful.<eos> Uh, the food, guards always frisking us up...<eos> Oh, please, ain't no guard ever touched you.
I am not feeling it, Red.<eos> And this pharmaceutical stumble is evoking more compassion than rage.<eos> - Like, maybe even a tiny bit of mirth.<eos> - Oh. All right? But I'm trying to keep a lid on it.<eos> Oh, I did it!<eos> "Standing down.<eos> Staying posted for the next go-ahead."<eos> See that, Red?<eos> There's, uh, nothing to worry about.<eos> Hey! Ladies, can I help you?
Five minutes.<eos> No, three.<eos> No, ten.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Hey. Go find somebody else to play with.<eos> What happened to your friend, huh? The one that looks like Sloth from Goonies?<eos> No, I hate sloths!<eos> They only urinate and defecate once a week, and they have to do it in the same place every time.<eos> Huge Darwinian disadvantage.<eos> Oh, please. I could go with you.
I thought that pervert PE teacher with the glasses touched you again.<eos> Bitches come and go.<eos> That's why they're called bitches, not lap dogs.<eos> I did not want her to go.<eos> I don't know why I listen to you. Leave me alone.<eos> Go away.<eos> Oh, I'm going.<eos> But I'm not gonna get back till late.<eos> So feed the kids!<eos> I will now connect you to the number you requested.
- Ms. Powell?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - It's Dayanara.<eos> Diaz.<eos> Oh. My goodness.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Are you... are you okay?<eos> Not really. No.<eos> I... I was so sorry to hear about the baby, Dayanara. I...<eos> I was gonna call you, but I wanted to respect your mourning.
I was gonna call you, but I wanted to respect your mourning.<eos> And, uh... you know, I...<eos> I guess I was grieving a little bit, too. I did...<eos> It ain't true.<eos> - What?<eos> - My mom.<eos> She lied about the baby.<eos> She's alive.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have told you.
I want her to have a shot at something normal.<eos> Please, Mommy. Please.<eos> She's my family.<eos> I have a daughter.<eos> I guess I...<eos> - I think I could do that. - Yeah.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Thank you, Mommy.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Powell.<eos> Look, I ain't gonna tell you how to raise her or the kind of life that she should have or whatever.
'Cause she will.<eos> 'Cause she's mine.<eos> It's in her blood, you know?<eos> It's gonna... It's gonna be okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Just wait, please.<eos> And?<eos> I don't know what to tell you, ladies.
Pennsatucky, man...<eos> Penns?<eos> - Get in.<eos> - No.<eos> - Get in there! - Get in!<eos> You'd think they'd find a place to put 'em that wouldn't interfere with our squirt and dirt.<eos> Well, that one was starting to overflow anyway.<eos> But, lucky me, I can't smell a thing.<eos> Jack Pearson's office.<eos> How may I help you?
Caputo said that you could help.<eos> Just like that.<eos> Look, I know you don't get somethin' for nothin' but what do you think I got to offer, huh?<eos> You could free the hostages.<eos> Well, how do I know that you are gonna deliver what I am askin' for?<eos> You don't, but I seem to be your only shot.<eos> Look, release the hostages and you'll see your son.<eos> Look, there's 400 bitches in here asking for a whole lot more for those hostages.<eos> So don't ask their permission.<eos> Look, what... What's more important to you?
You really don't remember?<eos> It was, like, four days ago!<eos> Plus, that shit was dark.<eos> - Wow. You girls have been busy.<eos> So, now, tell me, was this murder also part of your nonviolent protest?<eos> The murder ain't the point.<eos> The point is our education program ain't never been no education program, even before it was put on hold for some alleged murder.<eos> Manual labor without instruction ain't an education, and it damn sure ain't no life skills.<eos> You think she'd be sayin' "ain't" so much if we had an education program?<eos> I'd like to believe you.
-I hope you're wrong.<eos> -Me, too!<eos> 'Cause I'm tired of bein' right about people.<eos> Have a good fucking life, okay?<eos> Fucking what?<eos> You are magnificent.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Man, this shit wouldn't cut butter!<eos> Jefferson, that you?<eos> Hold up, Mr. C. We setting' you free.
A'ight.<eos> Damn!<eos> No need to thank us, Mr. C.<eos> - I'm not thanking you.<eos> - You grudgin' it out.<eos> I respect that, but this ain't no freebie.<eos> We need your help.<eos> You punched me.<eos> You took me hostage.<eos> Why would I ever, ever help you?
Damn!<eos> No need to thank us, Mr. C.<eos> - I'm not thanking you.<eos> - You grudgin' it out.<eos> I respect that, but this ain't no freebie.<eos> We need your help.<eos> You punched me.<eos> You took me hostage.<eos> Why would I ever, ever help you?<eos> Okay, let me catch you up.
That's when you come in.<eos> You'll be our... credibility man.<eos> Who they send?<eos> They send a lawyer?<eos> Nah, they sent in that chick that you hate... Figueroa.<eos> The one that used to have your job?<eos> And look like a giraffe, but kinda sexy?<eos> - She ask about me?<eos> - You did not come up.<eos> Ain't all about you, Mr. C.
Well, lucky you.<eos> Better bored down here than up there in The Purge.<eos> So you say.<eos> For all we know, it's a party up there.<eos> Then go.<eos> Nah.<eos> It's probably The Purge.<eos> Congratulations, Red.<eos> You got me.<eos> Oh, did Mommy not tell you about her secret plan?
It's time he learn who really runs shit 'round here.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Listen up, inmates!<eos> Work detail's cut short today because there's a health inspection, so you'll return to your cells at the top of the hour.<eos> And, no, you will not be paid for the lost time.<eos> Quit the bitching, please.<eos> Try to remember, you are federal inmates, not line cooks at Applebee's.<eos> Now there's a new shipment of produce out on the loading dock that is not gonna move itself.<eos> Rosado, Hernandez, bring the boxes back in, and you're done for the day.<eos> CO Samuelson will escort you back to your block.
That's one advanced kid.<eos> Turn it over.<eos> "Don't try anything, or we all die."<eos> Let's fuckin' get her.<eos> Make it count this time.<eos> I swear to God, if one more of these bitches tries to fuck me, I'm--<eos> -Nobody wants to fuck you, asshole.<eos> -All right, back off, boys.<eos> Yeah, simmer down, Anthrax.<eos> I'm gonna help you, okay?
Who do you think they're gonna believe?<eos> I'll shove my dick back in that boca sucia qué tienes if you make a fucking sound...<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Shut the fuck--<eos> We was just wrestling.<eos> You want a turn?<eos> I mean, we loosened him up real good.<eos> Everybody knows that puto loves to fuck for cash or whatever you got laying around.<eos> I will destroy you.<eos> Either one of you comes towards me, I will skin you alive.
We take 'em out when they start screaming.<eos> I don't hear anything, do you?<eos> He saw me.<eos> I know you're down here, inmate.<eos> Oh, please, make this hard for me.<eos> It'll give me the pleasure of wrecking you later.<eos> Oh, you're gonna have to do better than a pushpin.<eos> Teamwork!<eos> Ah, how do you like that, Fruit Brute?<eos> I will skin you alive.
Let's get him down into the pool so we have room to work, just in case.<eos> Girls, give me a hand.<eos> We'll carry him.<eos> - Yeah, I'll get right on that.<eos> - You know my right knee is for shit.<eos> It's difficult for me to condone violence, even if it's him.<eos> Nicky, please.<eos> If we don't get his confession, this was all for nothing.<eos> Don't make me beg.<eos> How many times has this woman been there for you, huh?
I think I should slap you and then you could slap me.<eos> I don't let nobody hit me.<eos> But it's like a sleep fighter.<eos> Gets your adrenaline goin' or some shit.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Adorefins.<eos> - Do it gotta be the face? - Hmm.<eos> Not really sure.<eos> But when my moms would try to keep my stepdad up, it was always the face.<eos> - What I told you about that shit?
It was, like, green or blue or something?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> I made Benny say it was his fault.<eos> I told him I'd take his Spider-Man if he told you.<eos> You know what I remember?<eos> At the pool...<eos> You must have been nine or ten.<eos> Benny sat and watched you and your friends dive off the diving board all day.<eos> He wouldn't even swim.<eos> Just watched you.
- He died!<eos> - Don't...<eos> - Shut the fuck...<eos> - Lying is very bad.<eos> - Dying is very, very bad. - Oh.<eos> Suzanne.<eos> Suzanne, I'm gonna need you to calm down, all right?<eos> You're a liar, liar, pants on fire!<eos> You've all been fed a bunch of lies.<eos> I mean, they wanna put labels on you, like crazy, psycho, deranged stalker.
- Yeah, right.<eos> You gotta fuck with 'em.<eos> - Oh, man, this is my favorite.<eos> - Yo.<eos> You know how this goes.<eos> Ain't gonna happen unless you all looking at me.<eos> I need ten eyes, right here.<eos> The slick one ain't looking yet.<eos> I can stand here all day waiting, so you better get your dude over there in line.<eos> The longer we wait, the more of you going to Poo.
There ain't no lesson here!<eos> Just a bunch of sociopaths torturing us, and for what?<eos> You think getting better food is gonna make you not a criminal?<eos> The world already considers y'all a pile of garbage, and that was before you went and held a bunch of innocent people hostage.<eos> You think people will be on your side now?<eos> You, with the boobs.<eos> You, too.<eos> - Me?<eos> - No, her.<eos> One of you has an opinion, the rest of you are gonna suffer for it.
Norma, you bitch!<eos> Impressive.<eos> Girl scout?<eos> All right, uh, give me a hand over here, right?<eos> I wish that we could go back to the us from two days ago and let them know that this is where we were gonna be.<eos> - Blanca, you'll carry the torch, yes?<eos> - Actually, Red, I'm pretty tired.<eos> All right, let's pretend we're at a Jewish wedding, right?<eos> One, two, three!<eos> I hate all of you.
- Please. This is a huge misunderstanding.<eos> - Really?<eos> 'Cause I'm pretty clear about Caputo's dick in your mouth.<eos> No, I... have a narrow jaw.<eos> That's... not the point.<eos> Please, just...<eos> Okay.<eos> If you just listen to me, I promise you, I promise you, I will tell you the truth, okay?<eos> Whoa! Jesus, come on!<eos> What is wrong with you?
In jail. Shit!<eos> - Open the doors!<eos> - Taystee, I'm not...<eos> Miss Jefferson... anything less than a "yes" right now is the end.<eos> Are you sure you want to blow this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like, sure-sure?<eos> People who murder people ain't supposed to just be walking around.<eos> Maybe even walking theyselves right down to Juarez.<eos> The two of you can come back when you're ready to give us justice for Poussey!

I'm having a panic attack.
- Stop. Breathe.<eos> It'll be fine, okay?<eos> Look, babies don't know shit.<eos> They're babies.<eos> Come here.<eos> We will let your families know you've been safely released.<eos> - Mine, too? - That's right.<eos> Um... she's an inmate, actually.<eos> So...<eos> What did Jefferson say when she sent you?
Perfect for my CPAP.<eos> I wonder how long it'll take 'em to wrap this all up.<eos> Hadn't really planned on so many... visitors.<eos> I've been called much worse and stayed much longer.<eos> Oh, Frieda.<eos> Look at us!<eos> He was so sure he had the win.<eos> Fool.<eos> Don't "us" me.<eos> I helped you out, but the game I play is defense.
What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - Sir, I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I... - Get away from me!<eos> Get away from my house.<eos> You got about two seconds to get off my property.<eos> Wait, I wanted to tell you that... that I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> What am I gonna do with that?<eos> You want me to say I forgive you?<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I... I'm responsible.
What am I gonna do with that?<eos> You want me to say I forgive you?<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I... I'm responsible.<eos> It was my fault... and I wanted to tell you that in person because I know you're angry, and you should be...<eos> - so I'm here to...<eos> - You want me to punish you.<eos> Is that it?<eos> With what... you want me to beat you?<eos> Press charges?<eos> Send you to prison?
I mean, how did I ever fall for it?<eos> Seriously, shame on me.<eos> - Boo, honey, please...<eos> - Oh, honey, let's...<eos> No! Ow!<eos> Ow! Please don't... Ah!<eos> Hear ye!<eos> Hear ye!<eos> Gather the fuck round, bitches.<eos> I'd like to take a moment to introduce you to Miss Linda Ferguson.
Looks like we got some sick people there.<eos> Do not come any closer.<eos> Please.<eos> They need Skaikru medicine.<eos> Move. Stand back.<eos> Nyko. What if it's a Grounder attack like they did with Murphy?<eos> What happened to them?<eos> The sickness.<eos> We lost more than 40 on the way.<eos> Please don't turn us away because of what I did to you.
All supply runs go through me, and shouldn't you be working on the patch to Sector 5?<eos> A patch for a ship that can only save a hundred people?<eos> Why are you surprised?<eos> I am an engineer.<eos> We have no way to generate water.<eos> The harder number is 400.<eos> Can you really sentence 400 more of our own people to death?<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> What if you do?<eos> What if I told you there might be a fallout shelter less than a day's drive from here, a fallout shelter built to sustain thousands?
Hear me as I say it this time.<eos> The end is coming, and it's coming soon.<eos> He gave this speech two weeks before the bombs.<eos> The world is dark and getting darker all the time.<eos> Everything we once trusted has turned on us... government, religion.<eos> Even technology has become a weapon in their hands used to poison our minds.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you're afraid, but it doesn't have to be like this.<eos> There is a way out of the darkness.<eos> I can show it to you.
It wasn't sealed.<eos> The radiation would have killed them in days.<eos> Leave us.<eos> He was one of the looters.<eos> You were wrong about the Flamekeeper.<eos> And the Flame?<eos> Destroyed before I could kill him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It'll be more dangerous now.<eos> More people will have to die to keep me in power, not that that bothers you,
-You wanna know why?<eos> Because Frank Underwood has failed to keep this country safe.<eos> The death of James Miller, the so-called ICO attack at Capital East Telecom network...<eos> Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying ICO wasn't responsible?<eos> I'm saying it doesn't matter.<eos> The Internet went down on the president's watch.<eos> -Don't you think ICO was-- -Now listen, Fred--<eos> -No, ICO is a real threat.<eos> -There's a lot of people waiting and I promised one question per person.<eos> It was great talking to you, and please don't forget to vote tomorrow.
- Mr. President?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> See you in Gettysburg.<eos> You're saying it doesn't matter if Underwood knew about pay-for-play?<eos> Well, I'm saying it's bad either way.<eos> He either stole the presidency from his own party, or he was vice president in a corrupt administration.<eos> But it's important that we let the committee do its job.<eos> So thanks for your call, Annie.<eos> Arthur Capo from Del Rey Beach, Hawaii. Arthur, how you doing?<eos> Why did they want to talk to you?
Especially her brand.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Could you get me some water, please?<eos> Hello, everyone.<eos> Thank you so much. Thank you very much.<eos> Oh, thanks so much.<eos> Oh, now stop that.<eos> Stop it, stop it. Enough, enough, enough. Enough.<eos> It's embarrassing, all of that adulation.<eos> Hello, nice to see you.
-But I know my husband. -I know you do.<eos> And those questions were to be expected, yes?<eos> It's a good thing Squire changed his mind.<eos> We can pull some tape and put something together tonight. Hit some markets in the morning.<eos> When it's time to vote...<eos> Will saved his life.<eos> This is too much.<eos> I don't want any more questions about the war.<eos> That's not gonna work.<eos> Look, I can show you numbers, I can show you how well it's all playing for us.

His strengths, his weaknesses, his skill set and the contents of his soul.<eos> I hope you're not questioning my loyalty.<eos> I just like to know about the people who work for me, LeAnn.<eos> -I'm pretty straightforward.<eos> -I don't believe that for a second.<eos> The first time I sat down with Doug, it was more of a confession than a conversation.<eos> He told me about his drinking, his past.<eos> He was completely open with me.<eos> I don't think we can rely on Craig Squire.<eos> Then why am I still talking to you?
Or pull him out if you can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I didn't mean take over. I just meant let's appear as a ticket.<eos> -"Are we united or are we divided?"<eos> -Francis--<eos> "Here at Gettysburg, one of the bloodiest battles--"<eos> I know your speech.<eos> But can you finish?<eos> You have to know how to finish, Claire.<eos> I have the distinct honor of introducing you to, God-willing and the creek don't rise, the current and next President of the United States of America,
Two are approximately the same age as the ICO Kalabi, and one entered the United States three weeks ago from Afghanistan by way of Canada.<eos> He's visiting his girlfriend in Tennessee who works at a Knoxville bookstore.<eos> So why are you bringing me all this?<eos> You asked for options, sir.<eos> To arrest Muhammed Kalabi on election day?<eos> Cathy, what's gonna happen when he tells the authorities he's the wrong one?<eos> But that would be after the election--<eos> Well, that might have played three or four days ago, Cathy, but now it's too late.<eos> -Did you have this three or four days ago?<eos> -I would have brought it to you, sir.
-Did you have this three or four days ago?<eos> -I would have brought it to you, sir.<eos> All right, well, let's leave it at that.<eos> Send in Doug. The secretary is just leaving.<eos> That's all we have on the Squire rescue.<eos> It's not enough, unfortunately.<eos> Sir... when it comes to Matthews, I don't believe he'll deliver.<eos> Let's take this from his hands.<eos> We need to protect the polls.<eos> The request won't come from you. The way this thing is built, you're nowhere near it.
-Basil Hayden?<eos> You're killing me, buddy.<eos> -What do you got?<eos> -Bulleit's as good as it gets in here.<eos> I'll have that.<eos> -Woman?<eos> -Work.<eos> Yeah, well, nothing's forever, man.<eos> Those two down there, and anyone else who comes in here until that's gone.<eos> That's for you.
And as I turn... I see the moonlight on her face... and everything just slows down.<eos> And that's how we met.<eos> Me and Hannah.<eos> Well, I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one up this late.<eos> Mr. President, do you have a question for me?<eos> But I thought I would give you the chance to ask me a question.<eos> I'm not sure I have any questions for you.<eos> Oh, don't be shy, Will.<eos> I mean, after all, this is a rare opportunity.<eos> Just between you and me.
All we can do is make a case for ourselves while we're here.<eos> Here's my question.<eos> I successfully negotiated the release of Caroline and Melissa Miller.<eos> Then you stepped in.<eos> You didn't let me finish the job.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you really want me to answer that question, Will?<eos> -Because I'm not sure you do.<eos> -Oh, I do.<eos> Because they knew they could take advantage of you. They saw it.

I did what I did... because it's what I had to do.<eos> Not like some others.<eos> I've been in public office my entire adult life, Will.<eos> The truth is, I went to school with guys like you.

I would like to thank the American people for their overwhelming support tonight.<eos> As your next president, I do not take this mandate lightly.<eos> In fact... it is heavy as hell.<eos> You got a better chance than Underwood does.<eos> Those are very high heels, Bridget.<eos> When Underwood loses, the committee goes away.<eos> You're breaking my heart.<eos> I was looking forward to hearing what you had to say about Doug Stamper.<eos> Yeah, I was looking forward to saying it.<eos> I came here to thank you.

I mean... uh, you saw it.
-My husband.<eos> You were anxious to talk to him, weren't you?<eos> Yeah, I was. But, uh... I'm sort of getting over the idea, if you know what I mean.<eos> There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff. Forty-five miles an hour.<eos> -How fast was I going, Officer?<eos> -I'd say around 90.<eos> Suppose you get off that motorcycle and give me a ticket.<eos> So I'd let you off with a warning this time.<eos> Suppose it doesn't take.<eos> Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles.
The one you get for being a success.<eos> Well, then I should have it.<eos> Uh, that never really came up.<eos> All that's left to do now is bring these to the needy.<eos> Best I can do is charge you ten dollars to throw them in my Dumpster.<eos> How about I give you a trophy that says "Best Pawn Shop"?<eos> Not unless I earned it.<eos> Dad's watch!<eos> Hey, dirtbag shopkeep.<eos> How did this come to you?
Excellent.<eos> Kudos.<eos> And now for your first economics lesson.<eos> So long, suckers!<eos> Boola Boola?<eos> Moola moola.<eos> ♪ and you can't make it without a college degree.<eos> But for some reason worthy students don't always get in.<eos> Students these days don't have four years to waste at a fully-accredited institution.<eos> Burns University will grab you by the pants and fling you into the job of your dreams.
It's not a tumor.<eos> Oh, they were great.<eos> They inspired me.<eos> And the best part is where they show the real guy over the credits.<eos> He looks just like the actor but fatter.<eos> Okay, listen up.<eos> All it takes to be a great teacher is to care.<eos> And I care.<eos> So I'm a great teacher.<eos> I don't like you, and you don't like me, but I'm your only ticket out of the barrio.
Nothing will stop the greatest teacher in the world from painting houses!<eos> You'll be working for this man at his private estate.<eos> What?<eos> Me?<eos> Alone? Without my kids?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The owner of more for-profit colleges than anyone in the world.<eos> But these students are going to miss you.

You are the greatest living educators, of humans.<eos> But now you must face the greatest challenge of your lives:<eos> Can you teach an artificial intelligence?<eos> To teach a robot.<eos> Now you've compounded my interest.<eos> That was a very useful time cut.<eos> Now, let's find out what's going on.<eos> Leave that to me, Robert.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'll tell you, and I won't kill you afterwards.
I never would have chosen this.<eos> - Waruu.<eos> - Minister.<eos> A word?<eos> Of course.<eos> The polling results are in.<eos> We've dropped several points on average.<eos> Granted, there's a drop in competence across the board, but responses to your specific appointment and performance, well... it's not good.<eos> You're not invoking faith in the electorate.<eos> They see you as an ineffectual poster boy.

Do not broadcast that footage.<eos> The last sighting of that Hairy and my wife was in sector 532, which would suggest they're headed for the mountains.<eos> How do you know which sector?<eos> I want full clearance for Steve Mclntyre.<eos> You're blackmailing me.<eos> I'd like to think of it more as a strategic alliance.<eos> The government and Slade Industries have worked together before.<eos> - We can do it again.<eos> - That's just not possible.<eos> Well, perhaps this might persuade you that we all want the same thing, Minister.
If you've hurt her in any way...<eos> She's unharmed.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> And all of her details now, including her crime,<eos> - are in the system.<eos> - I am the system.<eos> Release her to me under house arrest, put a security tag on her.<eos> I'll deal with the charges later.<eos> Now, where is she?<eos> I'll take you.
Charlotte, Jonah, get a move on.<eos> He just sits there.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Is he dangerous?<eos> Uh, no. He's not dangerous. He's a colleague.<eos> Why don't you wave to him?<eos> What, Buddy?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> I was just thinking... if my ex-wife and I had had it out like that... we might still be together.<eos> Anyway... the two of you are up to your ballsacks in drama, tell you that.
Told Mason all about you.<eos> And by the looks of those ashes, the good pastor wants nothing to do with your dirty money.<eos> Be grateful it was only your church that went up in flames.<eos> Why is there a Mexican sitting on your house?<eos> Agent Evans.<eos> I remember.<eos> Last chance for witness protection.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> We're moving on your husband, Wendy.<eos> With or without you.
Permission to bug your trailer.<eos> A garbage truck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She was taking the open house sign to the front of the yard.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - It's my fault.<eos> I picked a fight.<eos> - No.<eos> Well, I did.<eos> It is, 'cause I was telling her about you and Marty, and how you two are married, and... just to mess with her and... she was being mean.
Of course.<eos> I'll... I'll talk to Marty tonight.<eos> - Thanks. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You just let me back in until the end of the week.<eos> You gotta be fucking kidding me.<eos> Look, true or false? You have no idea what it is that I do or who I do it for.<eos> - That is not the point.<eos> - Right? You've never helped me and I will make sure you never would help me.<eos> You never signed anything. You never even handed me a goddamn pen.<eos> Which means there will be nothing to implicate you in whatever it is that I do, okay?

One second.<eos> Rachel... you let me back into the Blue Cat to finish my business, or I'm gonna come for you.

- Handler?<eos> - You can reach me at this number.<eos> What the fuck you talking about?<eos> I'm done.<eos> I did it. You heard Ruth.<eos> She admitted it.<eos> Actually, you talked and she pretty much listened.<eos> Nothing she said today was explicitly incriminating.<eos> We need specifics. Her plan to kill Marty, her role in the laundering process.<eos> I'm not talking to you.
I mean, what the fuck do they have on us?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Sam.<eos> Well, that's all we need.<eos> Hey, Wendy?<eos> - Sam, hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - So, I just... Hey, Marty.<eos> - Hey, Sam. Hi, buddy.<eos> Look, I'm... I'm sorry to bother you but, uh,
This is an awful time for you. I can't imagine.<eos> I don't want to make it worse by you losing money and...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Let us do this. We want to help.<eos> Wow, that's, uh...<eos> Look, I'm...<eos> - I'm sorry for showing up like...<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> Wendy can go with you to the funeral home and help with the billing.
- Between 100 and 150.<eos> - That many?<eos> Yacht club, bridge club, Rotary.<eos> Hundred and fifty, to be safe.<eos> Sam, this is a lot.<eos> Well, she always swore that she'd throw a funeral better than her wedding.<eos> Stick it to my father.<eos> So Mom, isn't it?<eos> Our compression services for the carat she requested runs $19,900, pre-tax.<eos> And I brought some of these diamonds here to show you.
It's gotta be him.<eos> All right.<eos> I will give him a call.<eos> Hey, Jonah?<eos> What time is your dad getting back from the funeral?<eos> I don't know. How...<eos> How long are funerals, usually?<eos> I'll wait.<eos> I need you to get down here.<eos> There is a delivery for you.
There is a delivery for you.<eos> Tuck.<eos> You okay?<eos> I need a favor.<eos> Heading out.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Thought you had the afternoon shift.<eos> Gotta go to the store first.<eos> Come on over here a sec.<eos> Need to talk to you.
- I know.<eos> Who could have rigged that dock?<eos> Did it work?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What if Rachel had gone for a boat ride?<eos> The boats are in storage.<eos> What if Charlotte had gone for a swim?<eos> It's too cold to swim.<eos> Those are your uncles.<eos> I couldn't have them kill you.
Ruth.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're good.<eos> I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am about your father and your uncle.<eos> Anything we can do...<eos> Thanks.<eos> When Jesus chose his 12 disciples, he knew that one of them was the devil... one was Judas.<eos> Yet he sat with them all and broke bread still.<eos> So what's the Bible telling us... here? Um...<eos> Well, as a minister, it's... it's imploring me to embrace those of you who might be... doing bad things.
- Don't look at him, okay? - Okay.<eos> He sees our eyes dart his way, he's just gonna get suspicious.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Uh, you gotta get the kids out of here. Okay?<eos> - To where?<eos> - Anywhere. I don't care.<eos> Just away.<eos> And where are you going?<eos> I gotta get out in front of this.<eos> When it's safe to come back, I'll call you. - All right?
- Charlotte, just for once in your life, just once, for the love of God, just do what the fuck I say. Okay?<eos> Go pack. Go.<eos> In a small bag.<eos> Something you can throw over your shoulder like you're going to the mall.<eos> What about Dad?<eos> I think you might've misunderstood this dance first time 'round.<eos> You pay a fine once.<eos> After that, you accept the punishment.<eos> I'm not paying a fine.<eos> And I'm not asking you for your forgiveness.
I'm a businessman.<eos> I trust the numbers.<eos> Y'all hear the bell this morning?<eos> Legend goes that when they flooded my people out to make way for this lake, they swallowed a church up whole.<eos> You can still hear the bell from under the water.<eos> Certain people believe it's a sign.<eos> A call to worship.<eos> Others think it's a sign that someone's gonna die.<eos> Today, it was both.<eos> Next time, it's up to you.
No, Ma'am.<eos> Don't understand it.<eos> Ain't no logic to it.<eos> Pastor Young says it's on account of him refusing to run heroin for you.<eos> So this preacher is a drug dealer?<eos> He claims you were using him without his knowledge.<eos> Did you smell his breath?<eos> I'd put money he was sober, Ma'am.<eos> Now you listen here, John.<eos> When we planted poppies, first thing we did was come straight to you and make sure there could be no misunderstanding.
I need you to be there with the kids at 2:00 p.m. Can you do that?<eos> - Wendy? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Say it back to me.<eos> I-80.<eos> Exit 112.<eos> Morris, Illinois. 2:00.<eos> We'll see you there.<eos> I love you.<eos> Can I help you?
Oh, it goes a heck of a ways further than that.<eos> I'll get another map.<eos> Sorry, we're closed.<eos> I'm looking for Marty Byrde.<eos> Well, he's not here.<eos> Are you cold?<eos> You're shaking.<eos> Yeah, we had an accident on the dock a couple nights ago, and two men died, so I'm just a little upset.<eos> Anyway, um, you know, we'll be open in a couple hours, if you wanna stop by then.<eos> I'll leave you to your work.
What do you do, exactly?<eos> I'm a private investigator.<eos> In Chicago.<eos> Why would Dad hire a private investigator?<eos> What about my dad's envelope?<eos> Did... Did you send it to him already?<eos> I was only hired to create three identities.<eos> - Mom...<eos> - I'll give you some privacy.<eos> Sir... did he ask you to make these up recently or... when you were doing your investigating in Chicago?
Congratulations.<eos> Jumper, get. Get!<eos> - Hey, Jumper, get.<eos> - He's a hunting dog.<eos> He's sensitive to different smells.<eos> So, I... I am in the unique position of understanding the needs of your operation and of your operation, and I think that what I have here is something that's... that's mutually beneficial.<eos> Uh, they have a distribution problem, and... and I'm proposing that the cartel becomes the sole buyer and distributor of their product.<eos> - And why would I consider this?<eos> - Because you... lose roughly 20% of your product to seizure at the border.<eos> And this would offset that loss, and would also put you about seven hours from your central hub in Chicago.
Can you produce him?<eos> Does that mean I can go now?<eos> You got my keys.<eos> Hi.<eos> I was just driving by and I saw your car.<eos> I thought I'd stop in and... and check on you guys.<eos> Heard about Grace.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, if you fold this in a triangle...<eos> Can I show you? You can...

You can...<eos> You just put his head here.<eos> Let me show you.
I should never have done that.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> I was just shut down, you know?<eos> I don't wanna hang up.<eos> Was that Dad?<eos> Was it?<eos> Nobody else would have that number.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> Are we going home?<eos> We're trying to keep you safe. So that's a no.
And before you ask, yes, every alchemist in history is a lying, cheating illusionist.<eos> They turn lead into gold.<eos> It turns right back in a day.<eos> So we are boned.<eos> How would you guys feel about robbing a bank?<eos> So... what are you really up to?<eos> We need to rob a bank.<eos> A bank heist. Wow.<eos> Hmm, I think the time we've invested in him may actually pay off.<eos> Okay, first, there's something I have to tell you.
"It might hurt more people."<eos> She wants to play it safe and kill both spawn and mom together.<eos> She's so stupid.<eos> You won't pay if your friend is dead.<eos> Listen, we are trying to get you the money, okay?<eos> If you want to get paid so fucking bad, tell her to call it off.<eos> Can't.<eos> She has a hundred spoons.<eos> Dokkaebi will not stop until trickster baby is dead, so you got two options.<eos> I can exorcise for you, or monster rips your friend's head off her neck.
Yeah, Richard did like his dad jokes.<eos> Anyway, I thought it could be useful, but at this rate, I won't actually get it to work for weeks.<eos> And I guess I'd be weighed down lugging it anyway.<eos> It's got a pretty small radius of influence.<eos> Julia, you can't come.<eos> What?<eos> Those invisible blood-goblin things, they won't stop coming.<eos> I mean, not until your problem's dead, meaning you are.<eos> If you step out from under these wards...<eos> It'll find me and all of you.
To me, they are.<eos> Your decision-making has grown increasingly questionable, and I can't have my people going rogue.<eos> "Rogue." I'm a warrior.<eos> No. A warrior knows when not to kill.<eos> Lincoln taught you that.<eos> You seem to have forgotten.<eos> You're right that we have a job to do here...<eos> What is Azgeda doing here?<eos> And right now, you're making it more difficult.<eos> Chancellor Kane, the King would like to see you.
I found your list.<eos> I guess we know who really matters to you. J...<eos> Jasper... You're not God, Clarke.<eos> You don't get to decide who lives or dies.<eos> The list is a backup. We have a...<eos> Well, I guess you don't mind if I tell everyone, then, right?<eos> - Please...<eos> People have a right to know that they're working for nothing.<eos> Is there a fire? Everything all right?<eos> Not for you.
You're the one shock-batoning Jasper, then arresting him.<eos> You're the one going too far and using the same old justification...<eos> "It's all for my people."<eos> It is.<eos> I know you think people will freak out, but if you just tell everyone the truth, maybe they'll surprise you.<eos> Monty, it's too risky.<eos> Jasper was right.<eos> You're not God.<eos> I have an announcement to make.<eos> Clarke Griffin has been lying to you.
Not bad, Becca.<eos> Doesn't matter what we do.<eos> Always end up here... the brink of war.<eos> Abby's on the Island.<eos> She'll find a cure.<eos> I know she will.<eos> We will get through this.<eos> On your feet.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're bringing you home.
If they can get it done before the radiation gets here.<eos> I guess we'd better finish the ship.<eos> They told us that you have a Nightblood.<eos> Nightblood helps metabolize radiation.<eos> We're investigating ways to create it for everyone so we can all survive.<eos> Roan wants you alive.<eos> Come quietly.<eos> That'll happen.<eos> Skaikru made me murder my entire family.<eos> We're bringing you home.
Roan, we're allies.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> You broke it.<eos> I broke it?<eos> You nearly killed Octavia.<eos> You're holding Bellamy and our Chancellor hostage.<eos> You marched an army here to do what, exactly?<eos> Why would you kill us when you know we're all gonna die soon, anyway?<eos> We're not here to kill you, Clarke.
_<eos> _<eos> Wait!<eos> If our snipers see archers on the move, they'll open fire.<eos> - Tell her.<eos> - Those are our orders.<eos> I will not allow my king to be assassinated.<eos> He doesn't have to be.<eos> I know Riley.<eos> Let me come with you.
- Penny! We're getting you out!<eos> - I guess I could help, for a price.<eos> I want to drive.<eos> For an hour a day, I get control of your body.<eos> - Fine, it's a deal. - We're gonna make another you.<eos> - Eliot!<eos> - In the center of your being, there's a tiny beating heart.<eos> It's called "a shade."<eos> It's what makes you feel.<eos> The pain will burn you till there's nothing.
- All right.<eos> - Follow me.<eos> Don't they have a copy at Brakebills?<eos> - It got destroyed.<eos> I figure you guys have every book here, so.<eos> - Unfortunately, you won't be able to take this off the premises since you don't have a library card.<eos> - Oh, no-no, I got one, um.<eos> I'm just the errand boy.<eos> - Mayakovsky.<eos> I'm surprised the two of you get along.
My daughters and our womenfolk need some peace in the village.<eos> They need husbands!<eos> Do they need a "teacher"?<eos> Oh!<eos> He is of no use from top to bottom.<eos> He's talking nonsense.<eos> Why do they need a teacher?<eos> We all will have an affair with the teacher.<eos> Grandpa Ali, please show us the right way as an elder person.<eos> What shall I show you?

I'd know what to do with you.
What do you mean?<eos> We came here as soon as we heard that there was a job for us.<eos> Sir, you can't find anyone better than us in the matter of women.<eos> We are the best.<eos> We have never missed any of them until now.<eos> No matter who you send there, they will eventually mess things up.<eos> Guys, show a little respect.<eos> I don't know who told you this, but there is no such thing.<eos> We made our choice.<eos> May God bless you.
Let's go.<eos> Get going.<eos> Come on.<eos> Dilaver, are we really going to travel in the pasha's carriage?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> He's here.<eos> -Guys, give us your blessings.<eos> -They are yours, pasha.<eos> I wish we could go with you.

First, go deal with your own wives. -Yes.<eos> Look at yourselves.<eos> You all became old maids.<eos> I'm getting laid all the time!<eos> -Kiss my ass! -Kiss my ass!<eos> You can only shit with those fat asses!<eos> By the way, Zerafet, yours is actually not that bad.<eos> Here you go, ladies.<eos> The magistrate told me to send the news immediately.<eos> This is not an issue that concerns you.
Most of the people who drank that white water saw the companions, the angels and al-Khidr in their dreams.<eos> -Is there any news? -Yes, there is.<eos> I hope it's good news.<eos> Finally.<eos> I'm so curious.<eos> Oh my God, please hear me.<eos> Hear our pleas.<eos> Let's go quick and hear the news.<eos> My God, please end this suffering.<eos> "We have assigned six warriors for you.

-Upon you, peace!<eos> Enjoy your meal.<eos> Pasha, when are we supposed to be on the front?<eos> -I'm not a pasha, Hizir.<eos> -Why are you talking like that, pasha?<eos> We know that you're a pasha.<eos> Or are you a secret pasha?<eos> You were sitting on the back of that carriage like a sultan.<eos> Was that all a lie?<eos> Guys, would I come with you if I were a pasha?
We know that you're a pasha.<eos> Or are you a secret pasha?<eos> You were sitting on the back of that carriage like a sultan.<eos> Was that all a lie?<eos> Guys, would I come with you if I were a pasha?<eos> -Would you?<eos> -No, I wouldn't.<eos> Right, you wouldn't.<eos> Then, honorable pasha, what is you?<eos> I'm a specially authorized state officer charged with bringing you to your post of duty.
-Yes.<eos> Oh my dear pasha, with a lovely mustache.<eos> An officer is almost an equal to pasha, right?<eos> Sure!<eos> So, who are we going to fight with, pasha?<eos> Guys, I've just told you that I'm not a pasha.<eos> Well, we got used to calling you pasha.<eos> We can no longer call you anything else, right?<eos> Now, hear me out and listen to me carefully, guys.<eos> Our state put each of you on salary from the treasury.
You heathen!<eos> Am I taking all these for myself?<eos> Would I ever get something illegally?<eos> Never, your honor!<eos> Everybody knows how you help the dervish lodges, the madrasas and the poor.<eos> Please don't be upset, your honor!<eos> There you are!<eos> Now, you're talking!<eos> Set this man free!<eos> -God bless you.

What is desperate?<eos> Weak.<eos> What is weak?<eos> Unable.<eos> What is unable?<eos> I couldn't find an answer for that.<eos> Nazik, we'll die on the front anyway.<eos> Does it matter if we receive this salary or not?<eos> I feel this pasha is playing a bad joke on us, brothers.<eos> Guys, there is something fishy about this, I'm telling you.
Take after your mother.<eos> All the warriors and ministers proposed to me.<eos> Your mother was the talk of the town.<eos> But I fell in love with your bastard father when I met him.<eos> Mom, please don't call my deceased father that.<eos> First, tell us this:<eos> Will those warriors like us?<eos> Oh, they will love you.<eos> Just do as I say.<eos> They can't find anyone more precious than you in this village.
-Okay?<eos> -Okay, pasha!<eos> -Leave the "pasha"!<eos> -Lift the pasha!<eos> Guys, what are you doing?<eos> You said "lift", pasha.<eos> -Put me down.<eos> Put me down!<eos> -Put the pasha down.<eos> God knows what to do with you.
-How is he?<eos> How is he?<eos> Why are you yelling?<eos> What a crazy man!<eos> Here, these are your clothes.<eos> -Pasha, they're civilian clothes, right?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Pasha, we were supposed to be soldiers.<eos> Did you change your mind?<eos> Who told you that you would be soldiers?
People have all those women, but I have only money.<eos> You bastard!<eos> We are doomed.<eos> The pasha of Baghdad came to the village of women.<eos> Go and hide all the goods.<eos> If the pasha finds them, he will cut off our heads, you idiot.<eos> Our heads, you say?<eos> What are you saying, brother?<eos> Kamil, Cumali.<eos> Everybody calls me "pasha" because of you.
When are we going to marry these lovely women?<eos> What are you doing, bro?<eos> Why are you so upset?<eos> By the command of God, the tradition of the Prophet, the opinion of the imam of our sect, and in front of our pasha and the witnesses, do you accept to marry these ministers?<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, we do.<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, we do!<eos> Ministers, do you accept to marry these women sitting next to you by approving the declared prices and with your free will?
So, I'll probably faint every day.<eos> Then, you can do it by fainting and waking, man.<eos> I haven't looked at any woman's eyes except my late mother too.<eos> I've always waited for the one.<eos> But they gave me three instead of one.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> You know the saying "God gives you three chances".<eos> But three of them the same night...<eos> We should get going.<eos> Don't forget, I chose you to preserve your own language, culture and tradition.
Father, I wish you would get married too.<eos> You wouldn't be alone at this age.<eos> And you would have a home.<eos> There would be someone taking care of you.<eos> Thank you, Cumali.<eos> You know what, I've prayed to God every night to have a child.<eos> Thank God, I have seven children before my eyes.<eos> I don't know when my journey of life will end, but my passing from this mortal world where there are lies among the truth is soon.<eos> I'm waiting for the day when I will reunite with my wife.<eos> May God keep you in right path, and keep you loved.
-I didn't poke you!<eos> -I was poked too.<eos> You poked me, right? Did you poke?<eos> -No.<eos> Who can do this during prayer?<eos> And I couldn't turn around to see.<eos> God damn it.<eos> God, forgive me...<eos> -It's a sin.<eos> I told you this village is weird.
-Did the vizier die?<eos> -No, he didn't.<eos> Then, why did you bring us the vizier's finger?<eos> Okay, you brought it, but why did you poke us with it?<eos> Okay, you poked us with it, but why did you run away?<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Vizier's Finger is a kind of dessert.<eos> You'll eat it to get stronger.<eos> Pasha, people are talking about the wars you won and the lands you conquered.<eos> It's an honor to meet a warrior like you.
Enjoy, pasha.<eos> Enjoy, magistrate.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Magistrate, I heard that you're single.<eos> You were never married.<eos> Sir, I didn't want to have a love that prevents me from living for God.<eos> I kept myself away from earthly affairs and devoted myself to God's path.<eos> It's written in the Quran:<eos> "God created women for men."<eos> So, we can marry you with someone from this village.
Just worry about how we can treat our husband like a sultan.<eos> In the palace, a woman can hardly come into the presence of the sultan, maybe after a year, if she is lucky.<eos> We'll be in the presence of our husband from day one.<eos> Don't forget this too:<eos> Sultans don't like women like us.<eos> Especially, chubby or ugly women.<eos> The sultan's foreign women are slim, elegant, well-groomed and beautiful.<eos> And look at our women.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> I'm not talking about you.
Emine, put some wood in the fire under the water boiler.<eos> And, I'll check on our husband if he needs anything.<eos> Go on then.<eos> Oh, my sweetheart with an exceptional face.<eos> -Pasha...<eos> -God.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Oh, my sweetheart with an exceptional face.<eos> After I was honored with the magnificence of your pretty face, I was rejuvenated by your love.<eos> I never intend to annoy you, I would like to exhibit my sincerity.
What is your name, my hottie?<eos> Habibe, my prince.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Great.<eos> Who is this beautiful oriental gazelle?<eos> Sadiye, my prince.<eos> I'll die, cry and burn for this gazelle.<eos> Sadiye, Sadiye.<eos> Flirty Sadiye.<eos> I'll die for all of you, Sadiye.
I'll die, cry and burn for this gazelle.<eos> Sadiye, Sadiye.<eos> Flirty Sadiye.<eos> I'll die for all of you, Sadiye.<eos> My prince, my prince.<eos> My handsome prince.<eos> We'll die for you, my prince.<eos> Sadiye, Sadiye!<eos> Flirty Sadiye!<eos> I'll die for all of you, Sadiye!
-Don't rush, be patient.<eos> I fainted again, right?<eos> Yes, pasha.<eos> Oh, my beautiful babies, I'll eat you up.<eos> Eat us, pasha.<eos> We've been waiting for you for 19 years, Dilaver.<eos> Shall we chat a little?<eos> Is there something wrong with us?<eos> Don't you like us, Dilaver?<eos> No, I like you, but...
Gulbahar, you spoke.<eos> Thank God!<eos> As long as you can speak, our Hamdullah is all yours!<eos> He's all yours!<eos> The gentlemen of Istanbul, wake up!<eos> We have work to do!<eos> Pasha, I have never spent a night like last night.<eos> I don't remember how many times I fainted and came to myself again.<eos> May God bless you.<eos> Thanks to you, we have everything.
-Amen.<eos> Nurdane, open it a little.<eos> You closed it too much.<eos> There are no unrelated men here.<eos> No, that's better.<eos> Just to be safe.<eos> There might be male djinns around me.<eos> Then, I'll fall into sin.<eos> The rest depends on my fate.<eos> If I marry the magistrate soon, maybe I will send you all to Hejaz.
Sparkling, veiled bride.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Who cries before her wedding?<eos> You found someone to love, so you need to be happy.<eos> Mom, we have a magistrate father thanks to you.<eos> From now on, the destiny of our village will change.<eos> You became the most important woman in this region.<eos> Stop crying please.<eos> I'm crying because I'll be separated from my children.<eos> I do everything for you and our village.
Oh. We need to go through these ASAP.<eos> Anybody who's been on that message board would have reason to believe that...<eos> Wally's family were zombies, and would have known where the family lived.<eos> Look for any comments that seem particularly murderous.<eos> Babineaux.<eos> Okay, Dentelco's head of HR is here.<eos> You ready to get into this?<eos> You're sure that's what they're talking about in there?<eos> Then what's with Devore wearing a padded bra today?<eos> What the hell is up with you?
Sure.<eos> It's all in here.<eos> Come to Momma.<eos> Jim Davies, in sales at Dentelco for seven years.<eos> And you worked in the cubicle right next to Cheryl for...<eos> - The past five.<eos> - Must've been tough.<eos> Especially when she spread the word about your affair.<eos> With a dental hygienist named Todd.<eos> Thanks to Cheryl's gossiping, your wife found out about Todd, then divorced you and took your kids to Virginia Beach.
- The past five.<eos> - Must've been tough.<eos> Especially when she spread the word about your affair.<eos> With a dental hygienist named Todd.<eos> Thanks to Cheryl's gossiping, your wife found out about Todd, then divorced you and took your kids to Virginia Beach.<eos> His ex moved to Virginia.<eos> She's with the FBI.<eos> But I wasn't mad at Cheryl.<eos> Actually relieved to be done living a lie.<eos> Still, your desk puts you in the perfect spot to doctor Cheryl's yogurt during the hubbub, just after the fire alarm went off.
Did you happen to notice who was last to the gathering spot?<eos> - Pretty sure it was Pete. - Ooh.<eos> Pete!<eos> Pete Aboud...<eos> We hear you were the last one out of the building after the fire alarm.<eos> I was on the phone.<eos> A sales call.<eos> - So, you weren't in the kitchen stealing food?<eos> - No. I guess you stopped doing that after Cheryl complained so much about her food being stolen that HR installed a kitchen security cam.<eos> The one that caught you in flagrante yogurt-o.
Just look for Natalie?<eos> I hate sex slavery as much as anyone, but I don't feel like going out in public at the moment.<eos> Ravi, it's a stakeout, all right?<eos> We'll hunker down in my car.<eos> You don't even have to wear pants.<eos> Why not?<eos> I've got nothing else to live for.<eos> And we know you're good at waiting in cars.<eos> Vicky Ernst...<eos> It says here that our victim, Cheryl, outed you for abusing company sick-leave policy.
More promotions, more problems.<eos> Am I right?<eos> All right, here's a problem.<eos> So far, no one's been able to place you after that fire alarm went off.<eos> Did you pull it, Vicky?<eos> It's okay. You can tell me.<eos> When the alarm went off, I was in the bathroom. Alone.<eos> I came out and I saw Jim running for the stairs.<eos> - He yelled for me to follow.<eos> - So, Jim could vouch for you?
There's that dry wit.<eos> Damn it.<eos> We're losing him.<eos> "We?" I told you to drive faster.<eos> Get out.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Over here.<eos> Grab some hood!<eos> Major Lilywhite.<eos> If we ever see you again, I'm gonna kill you with this gun.
Interesting.<eos> Glad you think so.<eos> On this thumb drive, one month's worth of recorded sales calls.<eos> I'll review them.<eos> Oh, boy. Another binder?<eos> Well, it turns out<eos> Pete and the other salespeople use company cell phones.<eos> So we have access to all those calls and texts.<eos> For you.<eos> I will juice you like an orange, my friend.
That binder contains all the texts sent on Dentelco phones this month.<eos> The one we've circled is one you received from Jim.<eos> Jim and I text a lot.<eos> It came in one minute before the fire alarm was pulled.<eos> The entire text is a single exclamation point.<eos> What was that about?<eos> You said you were in a bathroom at the time.<eos> You know, that's just this thing me and Jim do.<eos> We send each other an exclamation point when we see something funny.<eos> I read a lot of texts between you and Jim over the past few weeks, but this was the first exclamation point.
The exclamation point you texted Vicky, what was that about?<eos> That must've been a butt dial.<eos> I'm still trying to piece together exactly what went down with Jim and Vicky.<eos> Those two were up to something.<eos> That's for sure. I like them for pulling the fire alarm and slipping Cheryl the Utopium, but I can't figure how they could've done that and been the first ones to leave the building.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> You will not believe what I'm looking at.<eos> Rhonda was in pornos!<eos> I kid you not.<eos> No! I suppose I could put you on retainer, Mr. Racy.

I suppose I could put you on retainer, Mr. Racy.<eos> But I would prefer you put me on your very large...<eos> Clive!<eos> I just had a vision! Let me double-check something and I'll call you right back.
I found it after going through her porn-noirs.<eos> The All-Tease Phallus...<eos> Farewell, My Lusty... - Dial "M" for Moisture...<eos> - Okay, I get it.<eos> Sorry for making you watch all those.<eos> A welcome diversion.<eos> I may have become Rhonda Hardbody's biggest fan. And here's Georgina's sales call.<eos> I like the Ergo-Matic's price point, Pete, but how does it compare feature-wise to the Royal Brougham?<eos> And here's Lady Effamia. Right.<eos> I suppose I could put you on retainer, Mr. Racy.
Using her dental equipment savvy and her sexy Italian accent...<eos> Sets up Pete to take the fall.<eos> His numbers were down.<eos> You figured he needed a sale so bad, he'd stay on the phone if his desk were on fire.<eos> While you, Rhonda, distract Pete...<eos> Jim slips the Utopium in Cheryl's yogurt...<eos> Hoping to send her on a little trip that will make her the butt of office gossip.<eos> Jim then joins Vicky in the freight elevator, the little feature I found when I checked the blueprints.<eos> And which still operates even after an alarm has been pulled.<eos> Which enables them to race to the gathering spot ahead of the others making their way down five flights of steps, and be vouched for by you, who resented Cheryl for outing your porn career.

Hey, Reverend Shit-for-Brains.<eos> Aaron.<eos> Surprised to hear my voice?<eos> No, I'm...<eos> I'm relieved.<eos> Your mother was worried sick.<eos> Yeah, that's what she said.<eos> May I speak to her?<eos> She's busy right now.<eos> I just wanted you to know that... she's been thinking about you.

I found her limping up the old highway.<eos> She wouldn't tell me how she got out there.<eos> Well, what kind of shit have you stepped in, Evelyn?<eos> I was kidnapped this morning.<eos> They locked a bunch of us up in a metal cage out at the salvage yard.<eos> - They?<eos> - Chief Giles and that junkyard hermit.<eos> We would have been dead, Betsy and me, except...<eos> Kyle Barnes came and let us loose.<eos> He said to tell you what happened out there.
She doesn't really look like a killer to me.<eos> What?<eos> She keeps going around telling stories like that, and someone might just believe her.<eos> What did you say to him?<eos> Holly, what did you say?<eos> The truth.<eos> There's nothing available.<eos> You know what? For you, let me talk to my manager.<eos> Oh, my God! This never happens.<eos> He's making room for you.
This... man wouldn't stand for it. He got up on Sunday morning and he called those motherfuckers out.<eos> And you earned my respect forever.<eos> But when you lie to me! When you don't trust me!<eos> I got a short supply of friends, John.<eos> I can't spare to lose you.<eos> Especially when I can beat you at poker.<eos> Maybe we should make an agreement.<eos> No more dipshit plans that we don't tell each other about.<eos> We're in this, together... or we got nothing.<eos> I figured I'd find you here.
Would you look around?<eos> Does it look like we stopped any damn thing? I mean, does it?<eos> You tried.<eos> It's what you thought you were doing when you killed that woman.<eos> Right?<eos> Thirty years ago, I lost every goddamn thing that meant anything to me.<eos> I was angry.<eos> I wanted to help your daddy wipe 'em out.<eos> You can only stay angry for so long.<eos> It never occurred to you to come and see me?
All right, settle down, settle down.<eos> Yes, I know. They're both great books.<eos> So, my question is:<eos> which one do you like better?<eos> Catcher in the Rye, for sure.<eos> Holden Caulfield's a pimp.<eos> Iceberg Slim is a pimp.<eos> Holden Caulfield is a spoiled rich kid from the Upper East Side who goes to a fancy prep school.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> Uh, what about you, Mr. Anderson?
- Benny, this is not a joke.<eos> Or course not, man.<eos> People are pissed.<eos> All right, I'll be right there.<eos> I'm supposed to be at my wedding right now.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You seem like quite a catch.<eos> Listen, I'm not going anywhere until I get in my room.<eos> I demand...<eos> These gentlemen will be escorting you off the premises.
It's the Cooper River Bridge Run.<eos> Have you been living in a cave?<eos> No, New York.<eos> They have clothes in New York?<eos> Listen, brother, I need to get to The Palmetto Hotel.<eos> Oh, boy. Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Bro, that was a microbrew.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> - Ah! - I didn't mean to rub that on you.
Your belongings are, in fact, in room 412 at the Palmetto Hotel.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So I can go?<eos> You're still being charged with unlawful entry and shaking your Johnson at people.<eos> What's your pre-game like?<eos> You stretch beforehand or, you know, just straight up get wasted?<eos> Sir, I am not a streaker, okay?<eos> I was just trying to get to my wedding.<eos> You've been the victim of a serious crime.<eos> This morning at 3:36 a.m., the elevator at The Mills House Hotel was intentionally damaged, trapping you inside.

- Negro.<eos> Ah! Oh, my God, it's Brian McKnight!<eos> - You're naked.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> It's crazy, right?<eos> Especially 'cause you're the one that does the panty-dropping song.<eos> I write love songs, and I'm kind of struggling with this one,<eos> - so if you don't mind... - Sorry. Go ahead.<eos> Do your process.<eos> Man, I just wanna tell you, man, I love your music.
Hey, man, let me ask you, how do you do that thing in the videos, you know, when you got your shirt open and your chest is greasy, and the wind is blowing you, and you're doing this right here?<eos> - Man, I think that is incredible.<eos> - Right. You know, it really seems like me and you are bonding.<eos> I just wanna know if, um... you could loan me your pants?<eos> - I don't think that's such a good idea.<eos> - No? That's how you gonna do me?<eos> Oh, I see, "Make fun of the naked guy."<eos> You know what? You should be ashamed of yourself.<eos> Hey, you are a strange dude, but you just helped me write a hit.<eos> So I'd like to help you out.
I got kidnapped last night!<eos> "I got kidnapped last night." Wow.<eos> Somebody's trying to sabotage my wedding, and I'm gonna find out who it is.<eos> That could be anybody, Rob.<eos> What's that loud ringing?<eos> Ding, dong! Those are church bells, you idiot.<eos> Now, look, you're running out of time.<eos> - You need to get here now.<eos> - Oh, I'll be there.<eos> See, told you it was me.
What I'm about to show you was captured by our security cameras in the garage.<eos> At approximately 3:36 a.m., this sedan pulled in the parking structure.<eos> - Vicky?<eos> - Were you with this woman last night?<eos> But she did have a key to my room because she was the one that made the reservations.<eos> Her parking pass correlates to one of the rooms that was booked 30 minutes prior.<eos> In it, we found several rolls of duct tape.<eos> Duct tape?<eos> Here's where it gets ridiculous.<eos> Several keys got stuck in the gears, trapping you inside.
Yeah. And he's also the kind of man that's planning to take over your company.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> He's bought up 47% of your shares and has a lead on another five.<eos> Now, I know I'm just a substitute teacher, but... sounds to me like you're screwed.<eos> Cody, is this true?<eos> You always treated me like garbage.<eos> Worse than garbage.<eos> It wasn't until Megan and I broke up that you could even remember my name.<eos> I have been waiting for this moment for years.<eos> I'm sorry I can't take everything that's important to you.
For the whole week?<eos> Yeah, the whole week.<eos> Hey, you been signing up and doing chores?<eos> Got to do chores, all right?<eos> Got to help out.<eos> Kimara?<eos> Greg, hey.<eos> - Hey. - How are you?<eos> I'm good. I'm good.<eos> Well, it's good to see you outside of Virginia.
I need to be making money.<eos> Well, you need something right now, try some of the local sit-down restaurants we have around here, if you... you know, if you're willing to do food service...<eos> Or some of the fast-food establishments.<eos> How much do those pay?<eos> Minimum wage, around $7.50 an hour.<eos> My sister's making minimum.<eos> We need two incomes, good incomes.<eos> Well, you work one of those jobs, sign up for one of our courses, and time will fly.<eos> How much do the courses cost?<eos> Um, there's a range of financial-aid options we can help you with.
You understand that?<eos> Jeremy's screwed.<eos> You're screwed.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> It's not gonna be a problem.<eos> She's got nobody but her pimp in jail.<eos> We can handle this.<eos> I'm gonna take care of you, same as always.
It'll grow much bigger.<eos> Unleash these, and believe me, they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.<eos> - Do you know what a Niffin is?<eos> - No.<eos> It's when too much runs through you.<eos> Only the magic is left.<eos> Please... fix... my hands.<eos> Go... fuck... yourself?<eos> I think I can help.<eos> - Wow. - I owe you for real.
It was a warning.<eos> Something The Beast said.<eos> Uh... God, of course.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> I mean, he'd want to booby-trap his kingdom, right?<eos> So apparently, he left curses behind.<eos> Here, actually.<eos> So you think Eliot might be cursed?<eos> I mean, she was vague, but I mean...<eos> Did either of you notice that Eliot started acting strangely once he took a drink from the goblet?
Margo says go free.<eos> Oh, fuck...<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Penny says go free.<eos> You just had to let him save you, huh?<eos> You're such a girl.<eos> You know, I would like to see you dead regardless of your gender.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Both of you.<eos> I'm gonna take you someplace safe, but if I have to shoot you to get you there, I will make sure it hurts.
Good news...<eos> I think there's a way out.<eos> Does it involve your beheading?<eos> 'Cause that's the ending I'm voting for right now.<eos> I second that.<eos> My ass still hurts.<eos> Enough!<eos> Listen.<eos> I can't stop the curse, so the plan is we're gonna let it run its course.<eos> By killing you.
Shut up.<eos> Now, I took a little trip to get supplies.<eos> Oh, goody.<eos> Heroin.<eos> I always suspected this was how I'd go.<eos> Potassium chloride will shut down the heart.<eos> Adrenaline will kick-start it.<eos> You die.<eos> Curse ends.<eos> I revive you.
- Next. - No.<eos> No.<eos> There is no next.<eos> We are running out of time and options and god jizz.<eos> Look, just imagine dicks, okay?<eos> With one dick, you're just jerking yourself off, but with three dicks, suddenly you've got six people having sex.<eos> Which is more powerful?<eos> I think your metaphor literally doesn't make any fucking sense.<eos> It doesn't have to.<eos> It just distracted you long enough for Alice to power up the spell, which is all the shield charm has to do.
You're no god!<eos> Ember actually took a shit in the Wellspring?<eos> You're a farm animal!<eos> Well, that can't be good for Fillory.<eos> Quentin Coldwater!<eos> Shit.<eos> Why don't you and Alice come join me?<eos> You're weaker.<eos> And you're down six fingers.<eos> More than enough to kill you both.
How delightful.<eos> You have come here to beseech me?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> We have come to beseech your uhm... aid.<eos> Of course!<eos> You shall have it.<eos> Oh. Oh, but then you're going to miss it.<eos> - Miss what?<eos> - All the action.<eos> Between you and me, I think Alice should make this a very good show.
- Very good, thank you.<eos> - Do you know what Margot will be wearing?<eos> - Will this be the most expensive wedding ever?<eos> - Quick quote for the early edition, sir?<eos> - Right, that's enough!<eos> This looks pretty smart.<eos> What do you think, sir?<eos> Marvellous.<eos> Did you get assaulted by the press at the gates?<eos> Wanted to know all about you.
This looks pretty smart.<eos> What do you think, sir?<eos> Marvellous.<eos> Did you get assaulted by the press at the gates?<eos> Wanted to know all about you.<eos> I told them you had webbed feet.<eos> I'm surprised you've chosen Digby-Vane-Trumpington<eos> - as your best man.<eos> - Well, he asked if he could be. - Right...<eos> I can't tell you what Llanabba Castle is like now that you, Prendy and Captain Grimes have left.
I hope that's acceptable, old chap?<eos> I'd rather you didn't, Alastair.<eos> Well, I've said yes now, so...<eos> Do you know anyone who would write it for me?<eos> Doubt we'll have time to eat it all, but we should get everything.<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> - Good.<eos> Nervous about tomorrow.<eos> I think I'm going to have the boar and hare and duck and venison.<eos> Which of you is Mr Pennyfeather?
I really don't have time to talk to you now.<eos> This is my bachelor lunch.<eos> I don't care if it's the King's Christmas tea party --<eos> I've got a warrant for your arrest.<eos> Oh, don't be an ass!<eos> You've clearly got the wrong chap.<eos> This is Paul Pennyfeather.<eos> He's getting married to Margot Beste-Chetwynde tomorrow, at St Mary's, Itchen Stoke.<eos> You old enough to be drinking that, son?<eos> Those names mean nothing to you, of course...
Mama is upset about this whole situation.<eos> We both are.<eos> - Is she...?<eos> - She wanted to come and see your trial, but she's gone off to Corfu instead.<eos> On her own.<eos> Well, just her and some Russian friends.<eos> You can imagine what a time she's having with reporters and people.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - You don't think that's awful of her, do you?<eos> There's a way she might be able to help you.

- Paul Pennyfeather.<eos> Bit different from The Ritz, isn't it?<eos> We don't like your sort here much.<eos> Posh white slaver?<eos> You're in for a nasty welcome.<eos> Hello, Pennyfeather!<eos> How the devil are you?<eos> He's not Pennyfeather. He is D4-12.<eos> Always knew I'd see your pretty little face again.<eos> - It's lovely to see you, Philbrick. - You, too.

He is D4-12.<eos> Always knew I'd see your pretty little face again.<eos> - It's lovely to see you, Philbrick. - You, too.<eos> Get your clothes off, you ballbag!<eos> Put your possessions here.<eos> I always wondered what had happened to you.
Barely any lice.<eos> Cigarette case.<eos> Fancy.<eos> Silver.<eos> What's this?<eos> Cigar piercing.<eos> You watch your lip, you pansy bogbucket!<eos> Have you, at any time, been detained in a mental home or similar institution?<eos> I was a teacher in a Welsh boys' school.<eos> Don't you make jokes in here, young man, or I'll have you in the straps.
Hopeless governor.<eos> Matey, you'll never guess who the new chaplain is?<eos> Can't believe he's still wearing that wig.<eos> Good morning, everyone.<eos> We'll begin this morning by singing I Vow To Thee My Country.<eos> Oh, and, um, I would appreciate it if you could try TO stick to the correct words today, rather than... doing your own... .. amusing adaptations.<eos> Stick to the words, or it's diet number one.<eos> UP!<eos> I heard you'd been sentenced, but I had no idea you'd end up here.<eos> It's good to see you in a dog collar.
UP!<eos> I heard you'd been sentenced, but I had no idea you'd end up here.<eos> It's good to see you in a dog collar.<eos> - How long have you been here?<eos> - A few weeks.<eos> The Bishop thought that the best place for me to practise being a modern churchman was in a... a prison.<eos> The new governor is famously modern.<eos> So, I thought I'd enjoy it -- but some of the prisoners are even worse than the boys at school.<eos> They PRETEND to make confessions and then, they... they tell me the most shocking things.<eos> Well, I'm pleased to see you again, Prendy.

The Lord shall deliver me!<eos> But you will be crushed beneath him!<eos> Oi! Break it up!<eos> I shall cast you into the depths!<eos> - Who is that?<eos> - Harold.<eos> What's he in here for?<eos> Tax evasion.<eos> Really?<eos> The governor wants to see you.
How was that?<eos> Helpful?<eos> I think that man might be dangerous.<eos> Course he is.<eos> If it was up to me, he'd be on diet number two.<eos> Lockdown.<eos> Lockdown. Back in your cells.<eos> Back in your cells. You!<eos> Everybody in!<eos> 'I think Margot has treated you very badly.'
'I think Margot has treated you very badly.'<eos> I was always brought up to believe that it's the right thing to shield a woman from any harm.<eos> Who taught you that?<eos> Your father?<eos> My guardian.<eos> I never really knew my father.<eos> Oh, I'm sure that most of the time, that's a good precept, but... .. Margot isn't a woman.<eos> She's a monster.<eos> I think she's behaved disgracefully.<eos> She sent you to Marseilles, didn't she?
February was the last attempt -- by me and Marcel Laurent.<eos> Marcel was part of the mob that done the Hatton Garden jewellery job last summer.<eos> We made it over the wall, but, as I landed, I twisted me ankle.<eos> So, the screws got me, but Marcel ran on into the night.<eos> Now, he realised if he was going to escape the dogs, he'd have to run into Edgon Mire.<eos> But no-one escapes the mire.<eos> First thing they found was his prison hat on the surface of the bog.<eos> Then, an hour later, his drowned body.<eos> And that's the way it's always been at Egdon Heath.<eos> If the guards don't get you... .. the bog will.
Lovely people at the club.<eos> Good drinkers.<eos> Tolerant police force.<eos> Very little bother.<eos> And I had to come back to England to see Margot on business and the buggers were waiting for me as I got off the boat.<eos> - Margot's in London?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I can't stand it here.<eos> It's just not good enough.<eos> It's all right for you, you're antisocial...
Well, we'll be the first, shall we?<eos> I've started digging a tunnel.<eos> You know Prendy's here?<eos> No. I'm not surprised.<eos> Always knew there was something furtive and forbidden about him.<eos> He's the chaplain.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, nonetheless...<eos> I've been stealing these from the dining hall... .. then, at night, chiselling through the wall.<eos> - How long has that taken you?
In comes the offence, out goes the justice.<eos> I want you to know that it was entirely wrong of you to attack and insult the chief warder.<eos> He is none of those things that you called him.<eos> He symbolises the disapproval of society.<eos> And, like all prison officers, he is a member of the Church of England.<eos> He is not the "Whore of Babylon".<eos> But I want you to know that I understand your predicament.<eos> You are a carpenter by trade and I understand that prison life has deprived you of your means of self-expression.<eos> And so, you vent your energies in angry and rather foolish outbursts.<eos> And so, I have seen to it that a carpentry bench and a few tools be provided for you.
Do you understand?<eos> And once you've done that, we'll find some other work for you to take satisfaction in.<eos> Perhaps a chest of drawers or a French armoire?<eos> Thank you, Lord.<eos> There's no need for formality here.<eos> Besides, I'm a knight, not a peer of the realm... yet.<eos> Are you sure this is wise?<eos> You see, here, we tackle the cause of the trouble, not the symptom.<eos> And in your case, D4-12, I have asked that you join a theological seminar group as a matter of urgency.<eos> The prison chaplain will be visiting you both on that very matter.
Who gave you this?<eos> The young gentleman that's arranged everything.<eos> Which young gentleman?<eos> I don't know names, but it's very sensible to make a will.<eos> You never know, with an operation like this, what may go wrong.<eos> Right...<eos> Here ends my responsibility.<eos> From now on, the doctor's in charge.<eos> Get going, then, you filthy bogbucket!<eos> It's a delight to see you again.
Home Office regulations meant that we had to put bars on these windows for your operation.<eos> - You're going to be taking out my appendix?<eos> - Not me personally.<eos> Goodness, no.<eos> Er, Peter's bringing the surgeon to us now.<eos> Well, he's going to need good luck.<eos> I haven't got an appendix any more.<eos> Well, he's highly regarded.<eos> I'm sure complications like that won't be anything he hasn't seen before.<eos> - How wonderful to see you.
Yes, you did.<eos> Here's your money.<eos> Oh, marvellous, thanks.<eos> This calls for a little celebration.<eos> Yes, I think it does.<eos> I think the pub should still be open,<eos> - if you want to go and find one.<eos> - I will.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> It was lovely to meet you all.

I love you.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Hasn't Silas chosen his brother over you?
How intriguing it all is.<eos> I have medicines, Henry, that might help heal your face.<eos> I'm grateful for your consideration, Dr Priestley, but my face is cured enough.<eos> Let me at least apply some yarrow to calm the pain.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> But the pain is mine to bear.<eos> Are you the devil?<eos> Will you devour me?<eos> Up you get, lass.<eos> Master Sharrow, may I speak with you?
- My brother's gone back to Jamestown?<eos> I see you have all the fellowship a man could wish for.<eos> And so you should.<eos> Tenured men came here on salted promises of pledges of your own lands and wives.<eos> Henry, will you drink with me to jubilate your wild good fortune?<eos> No, you have that drink for me, Meredith.<eos> I surely will!<eos> Please...<eos> What do you want, Secretary?<eos> The maid Alice has made a complaint against you, Henry.
Then if you can't give me that, then...<eos> Please.<eos> I...<eos> I'm a man that keeps my word.<eos> I'll pay you for the dagger.<eos> When will it be ready?<eos> Perhaps today.<eos> Perhaps tomorrow.<eos> Today.<eos> Anyone travel with you to discover the treasure?
- We should mark it with an ale. - Rutter!<eos> You fobbin', mewlin' puke of a man!<eos> You'd like the arsehole of a beast like Henry Sharrow in the hope of a taste of some precious dirt!<eos> Hold your fat tongue, woman!<eos> Is there not a day that passes where you don't mock the wheel with your foul mouth? !<eos> I am loyal to my friend.<eos> What are you faithful to, Rutter?<eos> Is this the toad that I am shackled to?<eos> I see no shackles, woman.<eos> I'll tell you what I did wrong... stayed with a woman a day too long!
Shackled no more!<eos> Shackles be damned!<eos> You took great risks going so far off into the mountains, Henry.<eos> A man of such courage and will deserves to bask in the acclaim of his fellows.<eos> And the benefits of his riches.<eos> When that day arrives.<eos> You saw the silver, Governor.<eos> I saw silvery metal.<eos> You doubt me?<eos> Nature has made fools of better men than you and I, Henry Sharrow.

Will, Mark's here.<eos> - Mmm. - Hope you got some sleep.<eos> No, not really.<eos> Even went for a run, but...<eos> You hungry?<eos> Um, I just wanted to connect before the rest of this day kicks in.<eos> I spoke to Marshall.<eos> No, I told him. Things are looking good.<eos> Very good.<eos> I really want to thank you for everything.
How are the Ohio numbers?<eos> It's hard to gauge with turnout this low.<eos> That was kind of the point. For the other side, not Democrats.<eos> The governor's worried.<eos> Do you have any numbers?<eos> No, just what we gave you.<eos> I would think that the president might have access to some numbers that we don't.<eos> When I get them, you'll get them.<eos> - We're worried.<eos> - Hang in there. I'll touch base with you after the three o'clock wave.
- We're worried.<eos> - Hang in there. I'll touch base with you after the three o'clock wave.<eos> If you could all just give me a moment, please.<eos> You better head over to the ballroom.<eos> One of us should make an appearance. Sir, the day has finally arrived.<eos> Yes, and let's see just how long this day lasts.<eos> Imagine my surprise when the NSA called me about Muhammed Kalabi just... moments before you did.<eos> Situation is still unfolding.<eos> On Election Day?<eos> Francis... it's been quite a journey working with you.
I wrote a concession speech as well.<eos> With increased security at polling places across the country, will fewer Americans vote for the president this year than in any election in recent memory?<eos> Particular attention is being paid to typical battleground states, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where voter turnout has become a central issue that could make all the difference in this historic election.<eos> You know, if turnout is low in Philadelphia... the Underwoods are going under.<eos> You need a better in than that.<eos> You look like you've been chewed up and shit out twice today.<eos> Seems like you're having trouble focusing.<eos> You ever see a doctor about that?<eos> Um, what?<eos> Oh, 'cause I feel pretty comfortable diagnosing you with too much on your fucking mind.
Um, what?<eos> Oh, 'cause I feel pretty comfortable diagnosing you with too much on your fucking mind.<eos> Hey, let me get you something real.<eos> I'm celebrating.<eos> Two Oban.<eos> Celebrating what?<eos> Oh, you know Tom Hammerschmidt's long lead team?<eos> You're looking at the newest member.<eos> That guy never gives up.<eos> Mmm. I tell you what he's up to, feed him things from you.
... It's a very chaotic scene at the moment.<eos> What?<eos> ... There's a lot happening right now.<eos> Police are... are, of course, trying to keep everyone calm and safe here.<eos> And we will bring you...<eos> Where the hell were you?<eos> Tennessee. What the hell's going on in Tennessee?<eos> Muhammed Kalabi, the ICO guy from Syria who burned the effigy.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> I stand before you this evening as vice presidential candidate, as the First Lady of the United States, and most of all... as a citizen of this great country.
Well, I wish I were calling under better circumstances.<eos> I wanted to know what you're going to need.<eos> I can get some excellent people down there fast in case you... you're feeling like you need the extra security or...<eos> You there?<eos> I'm right here, yeah.<eos> I spoke to Shawna a few minutes ago, and we agreed that we absolutely cannot disrupt this election.<eos> You called my secretary of state?<eos> Well, she called me.<eos> She is a leader of the party in Tennessee. As are you.<eos> Do I need to remind you, sir, that yours is a red state, and every Republican in it is counting on you?
I spoke with his chief of staff, Tanya, this morning.<eos> He's getting clobbered in the northern part of the state.<eos> Low turnout in Cleveland's not helping. But he could still pull it out.<eos> He's not going to win and he knows it.<eos> How much time do we have?<eos> Ohio closes in two hours. And most people voted this morning.<eos> Some of these states are baked in already.<eos> Claire and I need the room for a moment.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - LeAnn, we'll call you back. - Yes, sir.
LeAnn, get the lawyers ready.<eos> - I can't do this. - Yes, you can.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no!<eos> - And it needs to be done quickly.<eos> It's too sloppy.<eos> Why are you here if LeAnn called me?<eos> Do I really have to explain to you what will happen if you don't do this?<eos> I don't care if he loses.<eos> I'm not talking about the election.<eos> I'm talking about you.
- I can't do this. - Yes, you can.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no!<eos> - And it needs to be done quickly.<eos> It's too sloppy.<eos> Why are you here if LeAnn called me?<eos> Do I really have to explain to you what will happen if you don't do this?<eos> I don't care if he loses.<eos> I'm not talking about the election.<eos> I'm talking about you.<eos> What will happen to you?

What are we talking about here?<eos> Terrorist chatter.<eos> Related to Tennessee?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Well, I'm gonna need more than your word on that.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, but the intelligence is classified, Governor.<eos> Then read me in.<eos> 'Cause I'm not doing this without seeing tangible proof with my own eyes.<eos> You can tell Francis.<eos> The other thing is, with Ohio turnout so low, people could accuse you of engaging in voter suppression.
Oh, what?<eos> You think I learned nothing from Al Gore?<eos> We kept them on the edge of their seats, didn't we?<eos> I guess that means the system is working.<eos> I guess it does.<eos> You're about as tough an opponent as they come, Francis.<eos> Well, I've had a lot of practice.<eos> Now, you be sure to give my regards to Hannah and the children.<eos> Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> I'm... sure I'll be calling on you for advice in the very near future.
Was that bait?<eos> Or were you the bait?<eos> I swear.<eos> If you didn't set Mr. Axelrod up, who set you up?<eos> Nobody.<eos> It's a thing that happened, not something anyone did.<eos> That is the kind of thing I'd say.<eos> You vetted the info yourself.<eos> I did.<eos> Which means whoever put you up to this was careful and targeted.
"Fottuto" means getting fucked.<eos> I picked that up in context.<eos> You know the kind of options this leaves me to get my money out.<eos> Go long.<eos> Oh, my bad.<eos> I overshot you.<eos> Looks like you finally have some family time.<eos> Thanks for coming down here.<eos> No, the Boyd business kept me living at the office, so I promised Kevin I'd spend the day with him when it was done.<eos> But I'm always happy to find time for you.
How's that?<eos> Ryan, why don't you show me the rest of the house?<eos> Soon, baby.<eos> It's just... I'm so close.<eos> Is the pool heater on?<eos> I think you can handle...<eos> Get inside. Now.<eos> Get the fuck out.<eos> I'm a pretty chill boss, but how far do you want to fucking push it?<eos> I wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.
You want the freedom to see other people.<eos> Yes. I want freedom... all around.<eos> And I would be free, as well.<eos> Consider that door open.<eos> You're really saying those words?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> For both of us.<eos> Wendy. What?<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> So, it's fallen upon all of you to figure out how to get us un-fucked.
This thing stinks like Billy Batts in the trunk right now.<eos> Austerity.<eos> You don't need to whisper it like it's some dark spell that'll come true if you say it too loudly.<eos> It kind of is, though, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because once you say it, you realize it's your only option.<eos> Austerity.<eos> Okay.<eos> Step it out for everyone.<eos> Well, the note exchange requires that the town pay you first, before any of its other financial obligations, like union contracts with town workers, teachers' salaries, all that.
I confirmed that.<eos> A guy named Joe Scolari made the call to switch.<eos> No one motivated him?<eos> It's hard to pinpoint where the idea to change even originated, or who he's trying to keep happy.<eos> But I do know that these things don't move unless somebody orders it to happen.<eos> Okay. Stay on it.<eos> I'm gonna get with Scolari, see if I can get a read on him.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to meet, Senator Scolari.<eos> Oh, call me Joe.<eos> What brings you up the Thruway?
Oh. You want specifics.<eos> Details into our process.<eos> Inner workings and so forth.<eos> That would be helpful.<eos> Sure.<eos> I can share that.<eos> The committee chose the location that would bring the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people.<eos> That turned out to be Kingsford.<eos> Just as I'm sure you took on the obligations of Sandicot for the good of those fine people.<eos> I hope this has been as much fun for you as it has for me.
I hope this has been as much fun for you as it has for me.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> He doesn't make any of his own decisions.<eos> He's got a string hanging right out of his back.<eos> And it's the Governor who's pulling it.<eos> I'll see what I can find out.<eos> I didn't sleep last night.<eos> Your numbers have been strong, even in a tough market.<eos> Yeah, they have been.<eos> So what was it kept you up?
I didn't sleep last night.<eos> Your numbers have been strong, even in a tough market.<eos> Yeah, they have been.<eos> So what was it kept you up?<eos> Russian hackers.<eos> They can fuck with us so easily, in ways we can't even comprehend.<eos> A few keystrokes and they can bring an entire airline to a standstill.<eos> Thousands of people stranded.<eos> So your fear is, uh, what?<eos> These hackers targeting you?
Who are you to those people upstate?<eos> - Chaos.<eos> Axe Cap is the agent of chaos.<eos> You know what austerity means.<eos> You guys traverse moral and legal gray areas all the time, but you can live with it because you're rarely aware of anyone getting hurt by it.<eos> With this town, you know exactly who's getting hurt, and where they're gonna feel their pain.<eos> And how their lives are gonna spin out of control because of decisions made in your presence, at a fucking mansion in the Hamptons.<eos> I don't even know that it's wrong for him to do what he's doing... only that I don't like how it makes me feel.<eos> This is all connected.<eos> When a situation starts affecting you so much you can't sleep, you have to take action.
For the foreseeable future, the chair will remain vacant.<eos> Going ahead, I am committed to complete transparency between us.<eos> No more silence or subterfuge.<eos> If one of us is angry, or disappointed, we express it.<eos> So, you can either quit right now... or you can stay.<eos> Prove your loyalty.<eos> And when you do, you will truly have earned that chair.<eos> Are you two planning to order?<eos> I'll have the mutton.<eos> What about you, Bryan?
All in the service of justice.<eos> Well, and the Southern District.<eos> Mm. Now you get to have your moment... as well you should.<eos> The question is, what will you do with it?<eos> Such ambitions are far from my focus.<eos> I see a run for office.<eos> Is it possible you'll go the other way?<eos> Cash out, go private?<eos> That's not you.<eos> No. Sadly, I'm like you.
Is it possible you'll go the other way?<eos> Cash out, go private?<eos> That's not you.<eos> No. Sadly, I'm like you.<eos> Public servant for life.<eos> Uh, and it's in that role that I'm here.<eos> I have come across a wonderful young law student, Emma Foley.<eos> She's at Cardoza.<eos> Smart. Studious.<eos> And a clerkship with you would, uh...
It's the ultimate luxury.<eos> It's corrosive, Chuck.<eos> I mean, I went to law school to help fix the system, not succumb to it.<eos> Sounds like you're feeling the holy spirit.<eos> For the first time since clerking for RBG.<eos> Which is why I'm careful with my own clerks.<eos> This is very personal for me.<eos> I mean, I'm finally in a position to do some good.<eos> Very inspiring.<eos> Just don't forget, it was the back channels and deal-making that put you in that position.
But the switch...<eos> it tracks back to Jack Foley.<eos> What do you want to know about Black Jack?<eos> What drives him.<eos> What moves him.<eos> Who he's close to.<eos> How I can get close to him.<eos> He's driven by maintaining influence... naturally... and growing his six-generation fortune and staying invisible despite it all.<eos> Advisor to kings and princes.<eos> There was a time not long ago I could have put you in a room with him.
Maybe the zeroes are O's?<eos> Error.<eos> Repeated improper code entry.<eos> Lockout in ten, nine, eight, seven... So you blew it up?<eos> Little bit, if you want to get technical.<eos> Plus side, no one else is getting that data.<eos> You need a new brain.<eos> You need a new face.<eos> Not what I meant.<eos> Look, if we can beat the Hullen into submission, my money's on you two.
Why isn't she waking up?<eos> Fight probably triggered sleep mode.<eos> It's like a hackmod kill switch.<eos> We all have one.<eos> Why?<eos> The whole point of making hackmods is to sell forced labor with superhuman skills, right?<eos> So? - So...<eos> How marketable do you think we'd be if we could use our tech against our buyers?<eos> No wonder you hate us Basics.<eos> Some of you are worse than others.
Havigan, please.<eos> A jumper I was repairing did some courier work for them.<eos> Said if I wanted in, that was the place.<eos> "Livio Surgical Spa:<eos> where reconstruction meets rejuvenation."<eos> I guess "We make skin suits" wasn't catchy enough.<eos> Well, if they've got black-market productions going on They're not just gonna let us waltz in there to the good stuff.<eos> Well, lucky for us, I know how to dance.<eos> Welcome to Livio.<eos> How may we serve you? Not sure yet.
You know what the skinning is about, right?<eos> Or do you just not care?<eos> - I care.<eos> But I'm not standing in the way of hackmods getting free.<eos> She's not killing innocent people.<eos> - What about my friend?<eos> If you want someone to blame, blame The Factory for starting all this.<eos> Why?<eos> They made us mods, not monsters.<eos> That part's on you.
Well, that was a waste of expensive tech.<eos> It wasn't real?<eos> So all of that was just a VR training simulation?<eos> That chip on you?<eos> Wireless sim-jack.<eos> Linked us all into the gameplay.<eos> - Nice tech. We're a little low on agents right now.<eos> We can't risk losing newbies in the field before they're proven ready.<eos> - So I won, right?<eos> We put you through three tests.
Gun, someone took my gun!<eos> New plan, this way!<eos> Once we return to the Quad with your armada behind me... us, the Nine, will do whatever we... you... want...<eos> Aneela.<eos> Interesting proposal, well-thought out.<eos> However, the Commander has already decided that, with the loss of our resources in that area, it was best to wait and gather intelligence before...<eos> I'm aware of my decisions, Gander.<eos> I made them.<eos> I haven't heard from my father in weeks.<eos> I brought you here because I know you're his ally in the Quad.
- the next flare.<eos> - Great, oh, uh, tiny side note.<eos> Um, repeated exposure will affect parts of the small organs like the eyes, leading to permanent blindness, and then it gets...<eos> - it gets much, much, much...<eos> - Okay, okay, so, less good.<eos> - Don't scared.<eos> - Get nerdy.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're back for the Remnant.<eos> Let me help you.
- Don't scared.<eos> - Get nerdy.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're back for the Remnant.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Wait, back from where?<eos> What Remnant?<eos> You can't see a thing with that thing covering your eyes.<eos> You're sewn shut.<eos> Who did this to you?
Him?<eos> Please, don't be afraid of the Guardians.<eos> They stay above to protect us.<eos> It is the ultimate sacrifice.<eos> Oh, yeah, much better.<eos> I am Yarin.<eos> I speak for the Unseeing.<eos> Are you the Undying?<eos> Y... esss?<eos> We have so much to show you.
That all this is for nothing?<eos> They did everything for a lie?<eos> They'll turn on me.<eos> It's over.<eos> It doesn't have to be.<eos> You can still save them.<eos> Friends, Unseeing, it's been a long, hard road, and now it appears it'll be a little bit longer.<eos> - This woman is a false prophet.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> She's tempting you, but you are strong.
Yeah, right.<eos> Whoa, like hells I am!<eos> For what?<eos> For the murder of Delle Seyah Kendry.<eos> No one's taking Johnny anywhere.<eos> Just doing my job.<eos> Black Warrant came through Banyon.<eos> Take it up with her.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Cool your assholes.<eos> As ranking officer, I order you to lower your God damn weapons.
So great to meet you guys.<eos> Huge fans.<eos> Huge.<eos> I come claiming sanctuary.<eos> Who makes the claim?<eos> Prima Dezz.<eos> Who you knew as Varrick.<eos> Varrick?<eos> - Varrick?<eos> Does "Prima Dezz" sound like a warlord to you?
Close family.<eos> You haven't changed.<eos> You raging meat stick.<eos> Well, Pree definitely has a type.<eos> You got balls of buckshot coming back here, Varrick.<eos> You used to like that about me.<eos> - You swore to lead us until death.<eos> You led the Ferran?<eos> Teensy bit.<eos> Varrick swore to lead you.
Oh, bless his little voyeur heart.<eos> Why would you bring us here if your ex was gonna kill you?<eos> Lachlan used to find me very charming.<eos> So what happened to you guys?<eos> Oh, you know: boy meets boy, they fall in love, it's all sunsets and fireworks until it isn't.<eos> How long since you ran out on him?<eos> Long enough to imagine all the ways to make me suffer for it.<eos> But whatever our history, Lachlan's a man of his word.<eos> The Ferran will protect Johnny.<eos> Now, the two of you need to figure out a way to save my sweet tush.
But you need to know that despite all this, I am the woman you knew.<eos> Even for the short time you remember spending with me.<eos> Three.<eos> - Three, come in.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're about to drop out.<eos> On my way.<eos> Okay, so we all know what we're doing?<eos> The Android and I pretend we're leaving the ship to head into the station, then double back to the hangar to monitor the airlock.<eos> I'm with you two, here on the ship, waiting for company.
How?<eos> We've got about 20 minutes before the paralysis wears off.<eos> Help me get him to the infirmary.<eos> Your armor's genetically locked, making it impossible for anyone else to use it.<eos> If you're wondering how I found you...<eos> No. Not anymore.<eos> I had a hunch the dormant Blink Drive was emitting a subspace signal.<eos> The real question was identifying the specific signature so we could shield against it.<eos> Already done, so no help is coming.<eos> I don't need help to take out the likes of you.
- I don't know.<eos> It's been months since I ran away from Draco-7.<eos> And that's a long ways from here.<eos> What happened?<eos> He spotted me in the mezzanine market and followed me down here.<eos> - San?<eos> - That isn't my name.<eos> What have you done to my android?<eos> She isn't your android.<eos> She doesn't belong to you anymore.
Free will?<eos> She's a machine.<eos> Sooner or later, someone will come looking for him.<eos> You can't stay here.<eos> They could come with us.<eos> I realize this puts us at risk.<eos> I don't ask for much.<eos> I'm hoping you'll consider my request to help them.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Let's get you out of here.
Android, you were programmed outside factor parameters long before I gave you that first upgrade.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> His nanites have healed his superficial wound, but the damage to his neural matrix may be irreparable.<eos> I'm sorry, but he's not the only one<eos> - you need to check out.<eos> - Yeah, we've already discussed the probability that Anya may be unwittingly transmitting a subspace homing signal.<eos> I'll locate it and remove it.<eos> In the meantime, I've set a course for the nearest station, as I'll require specialized equipment for the operation.<eos> All right, and when that's done...<eos> We have no intention of inconveniencing you any further.
My name is Chase.<eos> I assist Dr. Shaw.<eos> I'm sorry, you remind me of someone I knew.<eos> - Someone?<eos> - An android...<eos> - A friend.<eos> - It's possible.<eos> I'm a level two diplomat model of the now discontinued Talus line.<eos> There are still several hundreds of us in existence.<eos> What can I do for you, Chase?
We know you are there.<eos> Drop your shields, or we will commence aerial bombardment.<eos> How the hell did they find us?<eos> Marauder, they've started their assault.<eos> - Yeah, I noticed.<eos> - Are you on your way back?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Do you want me to distract them?<eos> Have they shown any interest in you?<eos> So far, they're only focused on you.
But we already did a scan back on the ship.<eos> You're what?<eos> EC-5 series?<eos> - Yes. - The newer models must be outfitted with shield tech designed to mask the locators.<eos> - Can you remove it?<eos> - No...<eos> - But I can shut it down.<eos> - You can?<eos> You're all variations of my original design.<eos> Nobody knows you better than I do.
- But I can shut it down.<eos> - You can?<eos> You're all variations of my original design.<eos> Nobody knows you better than I do.<eos> Hold still.<eos> There.<eos> You're no longer broadcasting.<eos> Anya... she didn't have to sacrifice herself.<eos> Let's fall back to the Marauder.<eos> - We are not going with you.
I'm sorry.<eos> With our engines dead, we're just another cold piece of debris to any ship sensors.<eos> At least we have that.<eos> Mm-hmm, and, maybe... comms.<eos> Hey, we're receiving a transmission.<eos> It's the "Marauder."<eos> Come in, "Raza," this is the "Marauder."<eos> Come in.<eos> "Marauder," this is the "Raza."<eos> It's good to hear from you.
No, we're the bad guys, but we're trying to stop the bigger bad guys from screwing things up for everyone.<eos> You sound like Kal.<eos> How well did you know him?<eos> We've been friends from way back, trained at the academy together.<eos> I was the best man...<eos> So you knew him well enough to know that he wouldn't have thrown in with us if we couldn't be trusted to do the right thing.<eos> Yeah, he took us down.<eos> He turned us in.<eos> But he also helped us escape because he realized that he'd made a mistake.<eos> He realized, like you said, there were bigger bads out there than you.
He turned us in.<eos> But he also helped us escape because he realized that he'd made a mistake.<eos> He realized, like you said, there were bigger bads out there than you.<eos> You happen to be working for one of the biggest.<eos> I don't always agree with our methods, but the GA is a force for law and order, and that is something I believe in.<eos> Well, if I'm right, and we're headed for corporate war, law and order will be the first thing to go.<eos> Come on out, little girl.<eos> We're not gonna hurt you... much.<eos> Back, back!<eos> Coming at you.
But he told the Android, had her warn us, that the station was about to blow.<eos> He didn't have to do that.<eos> Part of him must still care.<eos> Some small part, sure, but not enough to stop him from destroying that station, killing all those people... and killing Nyx.<eos> What was that?<eos> Six?<eos> Life support.<eos> It just shut down.<eos> "Marauder," hey.<eos> Tried to reach you earlier.
Yeah, we were dealing with a few issues.<eos> How close are you to getting those engines back online?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> We're still working on it.<eos> We're running out of time here.<eos> - I know, we're...<eos> - Life support took a hit.<eos> Oxygen is running out.<eos> We've got maybe 40 minutes left.<eos> We'll come get you before that happens.
Sit tight.<eos> I'll try not to wander off.<eos> Come on.<eos> Shh.<eos> You still awake?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just wanted to say you'll never know how truly sorry I am.<eos> For what?<eos> Betraying you.<eos> Turning you all in.
Yeah.<eos> Just wanted to say you'll never know how truly sorry I am.<eos> For what?<eos> Betraying you.<eos> Turning you all in.<eos> At the time...<eos> At the time, it seemed like you were doing the right thing.<eos> Or so I thought.<eos> I guess we both learned that doing the right thing isn't always the right thing to do.<eos> Bringing you in was wrong, but...
I am, and have always been, loyal to Zairon's rightful ruler and his father before him.<eos> Not a duplicitous Empress.<eos> Not a pretender to the throne.<eos> Now and forever, only Emperor Ishida Ryo.<eos> Well, you refusal to renounce your crimes have cost you my offer.<eos> So be it.<eos> So, instead, I'll make you another:<eos> A position in this court as my royal advisor.<eos> What say you, Teku?<eos> I accept this great honor and vow to serve you and the court to the best of my abilities, to my dying breath.

Theoretically, yes.<eos> But we don't yet fully understand how to control it.<eos> It certainly hasn't been calibrated for anything as large as this station.<eos> Well then, I suggest you calibrate it quickly, because you don't have time to wait for reinforcements.<eos> If you take the station back to Zairon, you won't have to.<eos> This is a clone body.<eos> I don't care if it gets destroyed.<eos> I doubt you feel the same way about your own.<eos> And make no mistake.<eos> The people who are coming won't hesitate to kill you to get what they want.
I'm picking up some unusual energy readings emanating from the station.<eos> Something to do with the nebula, maybe?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You don't think they would try to use the drive, do you?<eos> Guys, we've got a slight problem here.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I-I don't even know how to describe it.<eos> Did we make it back to Zairon?<eos> Emperor, it's my duty to inform you that we have failed.
What do you mean "nothing"?<eos> I know it sounds crazy, but I'm staring at it right now.<eos> Blink Drive.<eos> They used it and screwed up.<eos> Sounds familiar.<eos> This isn't some alternate reality.<eos> This is just... nowhere.<eos> Raza, do you read?<eos> Raza, do you copy?<eos> I told you, there's nothing out there.
They've gotten past our defenses, haven't they?<eos> I told you we weren't equipped for this.<eos> I told you the Blink Drive wasn't ready!<eos> Watch your tone, Doctor.<eos> This may be a clone body, but when I transfer back, the real emperor will remember everything that happened here.<eos> What can we do?<eos> They're going to kill us.<eos> You're afraid.<eos> As you should be.<eos> But don't let it sway you from the task at hand.
Let me guess: the outer edges of the station are being eaten away.<eos> If it keeps coming, pretty soon I'm gonna have a big problem.<eos> If we lose the Marauder, there's no way off this station, even if we get back to normal space.<eos> Emperor, what about the other scientists?<eos> What about them?<eos> They're all in a hab pod on the outer limb of the station.<eos> They don't have much time.<eos> You have to release the lockdown so they can move out and into the inner hub.<eos> I'm sorry, Dr. Borsa. I can't do that.<eos> If I did that, there'd be nothing to stop these intruders from making their way to the lab, shooting you both, and taking the Blink Drive for themselves.
You heard what I said about our shuttle.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> We've adapted the Blink Drive to its engines before, and we can do it again.<eos> It's our best chance at getting everyone off this station, but we need your help.<eos> We're running out of time, Doctor.<eos> What's it gonna be?<eos> You can't trust them.<eos> It's a trick.<eos> I need an answer.<eos> Even if I wanted to help you,
What's it gonna be?<eos> You can't trust them.<eos> It's a trick.<eos> I need an answer.<eos> Even if I wanted to help you,<eos> I can't terminate the lockdown.<eos> The Emperor used his personal command code.<eos> There's got to be something you can do, some way to work around it.<eos> I'm guessing you know this station better than anyone.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?
This is just what we need.<eos> Six, come in.<eos> Guys, I don't know how much longer I can stay here.<eos> That wall of whatever it is...<eos> It's only a few meters away from the Marauder.<eos> Main power just went out in the station.<eos> The force field blocking the shuttle bay should be down too.<eos> Roger that.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Meet you on the inside.
- Do you... do you mean Portland?<eos> - Correct.<eos> Could I use the bathroom?<eos> Jake, you can just wait<eos> - till we get home.<eos> - It's an emergency.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Okay, I know where it is.<eos> He used to come over here all the time to play with the Shapiros' boy.<eos> Listen, we're having people over later and would love all of you to come.
Well, why don't you come in, grab a drink, mingle?<eos> Remember, you're a couple.<eos> We're a couple.<eos> And you're a disaffected youth committed to sulking and avoiding all social discourse.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Pumpkin.<eos> Hi, folks.<eos> - Yup. - Elaine.<eos> Mitch.<eos> Good to see you.
Well, I have a feeling you'll be pleasantly surprised.<eos> She can finally eat solids now.<eos> Well, she shouldn't have touched her eye, but of course Mario felt horrible.<eos> Usually he samples his wings, but, you know, he was in such a rush...<eos> Professor, glad you made it.<eos> Have you met our new neighbors, Elaine and Mitch?<eos> That's no problem.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Better white than red?<eos> Nice to meet you.
Okay, hold on.<eos> We don't want to get any closer.<eos> They'll only be out for a few minutes, so we got to get moving.<eos> Wait!<eos> What the hell's he doing here?<eos> It's okay.<eos> They helped me.<eos> You're leaving, aren't you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Take me with you.
- Who's that?<eos> - Dr. Christine Connor, the inventor of the FTL engine.<eos> Wait, Connor?<eos> Greatgranddaughter of Jake Connor.<eos> According to the records, his tales of potential space travel inspired her to pursue a career in astroengineering.<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> - We did effect the timeline?<eos> - And isn't that a paradox?<eos> Unless we were always meant to go back in time and affect the timeline, in which case... maybe it's not.<eos> Commander Nieman, how can I help you?
You didn't actually think it'd be that easy, did you?<eos> I assumed we'd be fighting the corporations,<eos> - not each other.<eos> - Well, we're workers, not politicians.<eos> You can't expect much in terms of diplomacy.<eos> I'd have settled for a little compassion.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know if I can do this anymore.<eos> Please... don't give up on us.<eos> We need you.
I'd have settled for a little compassion.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know if I can do this anymore.<eos> Please... don't give up on us.<eos> We need you.<eos> Frankly, I'm surprised that the crew of the "Raza" is willing to help broker this alliance.<eos> Given your reputation, I'd assumed you'd just assume cut our throats as save us.<eos> Guess it just goes to show how badly we wanna see this work.<eos> And if a bunch of...<eos> self-serving outlaws are willing to help your cause, maybe that could inspire you to make an effort.
Guess it just goes to show how badly we wanna see this work.<eos> And if a bunch of...<eos> self-serving outlaws are willing to help your cause, maybe that could inspire you to make an effort.<eos> - It's not that simple.<eos> - While you and your buddies sit around a table arguing, people are dying.<eos> Provoking Ferrous Corp<eos> - isn't the answer.<eos> - You already provoked them, the moment you declared your independence.<eos> - They need us.<eos> - They don't need you.
I'll go get him.<eos> Is it really necessary?<eos> Necessary?<eos> Nah.<eos> It's kinda cool, though, huh?<eos> I'm talking about the fact that you're keeping us under guard.<eos> It's for your own protection.<eos> Do you expect us to believe that?<eos> One of your buddies just got killed.<eos> Any one of you could be next.
To do your hair, remember?<eos> Oh. I changed my mind.<eos> You asked me.<eos> You said you'd come.<eos> I had more important matters to attend to.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Once you reach the station, take separate transport ships out.<eos> Do not contact anyone till you're en route.<eos> Now, before you go, I just wanted to say this.<eos> One of you may have just caused your colonies their best shot at survival.
He's taking the ship.<eos> How?<eos> The Android reactivated the transit pods.<eos> She had weapons waiting for them.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> I don't think the Android you know is in control anymore.<eos> We're within weapons range of the Raza.<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> You think we're just gonna forget the fact that you betrayed us?<eos> After the coup, I could have held you prisoner, forced you to give up the drive.
And as you've probably already figured out, the Android is under my control.<eos> You're a remarkable girl and I have no doubt you'll be able to elude my men for quite some time, and even put up quite a fight when you're eventually captured.<eos> Make no mistake.<eos> Sooner or later, you will be captured.<eos> Reinforcements are already on their way.<eos> Our... disagreement has gotten out of hand.<eos> Fueled by misunderstandings and, I'll admit, overreactions on both sides.<eos> Now, I'd like to offer a truce.<eos> Give up the drive and, in return, I will give up this ship.<eos> I'll release you all, unharmed.
What's your conflict with Zairon?<eos> What does Zairon have to do with this?<eos> Ryo.<eos> Six.<eos> It's good to see you again.<eos> Emperor Ishida?<eos> We don't know what your issue is with this ship's crew and, frankly, we don't care.<eos> This has nothing to do with us.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> It could have everything to do with you.

Imagine them under threat.<eos> They turn to you but the odds seem hopeless until... you discover a piece of technology that could change everything.<eos> What would you do to get it?<eos> Anything.<eos> Now imagine you had this piece of technology, the means to save them, only to have someone take it from you.<eos> - You have this device?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Give it to him.<eos> - No.<eos> What he's not telling you is this device is incredibly powerful.
The bottom line is if we join the league,<eos> Ferrous can't touch us.<eos> If we don't, they're gonna pick us off one by one.<eos> This deal puts you in Ryo Ishida's debt.<eos> It's not a place you want to be.<eos> I know it may seem like the easy answer right now, but sooner or later, you will regret this.<eos> - Six, it's me.<eos> - Five, where are you?<eos> I'm safe for now.<eos> I'm working on a plan to free you.
The Android and Five have been trying to fix it ever since we took it back.<eos> Your scientists are to blame for this.<eos> The Drive is useless now.<eos> So then give it to me.<eos> Maybe we should just destroy it.<eos> End this.<eos> Blink Drive or not, you know this won't end until one of us is dead.<eos> I wish it wouldn't come to that.<eos> I'm going to transfer back to Zairon now with the memories of this encounter.<eos> Unless any of you object?
After what he did to you?<eos> Admittedly, it was a very unpleasant experience.<eos> I was conscious of my actions, but unable to stop them.<eos> Well, hopefully the colonists understand that you weren't responsible for killing their man.<eos> But Five, I didn't kill him.<eos> So, did you decide to take the deal?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Care to come with us and try to convince the others it's a mistake?<eos> I've said my piece.<eos> It's up to you now.
So, did you decide to take the deal?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Care to come with us and try to convince the others it's a mistake?<eos> I've said my piece.<eos> It's up to you now.<eos> So that's it?<eos> You're just gonna walk away?<eos> There's only so much talking I can do.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll do my best to help you.
He's a business rival.<eos> He's been poaching our clients for years, but he's never done anything like this before.<eos> What kind of back-ups he got?<eos> Couple of thugs...<eos> Hmm. But nothing you guys can't handle.<eos> Whoa. I said, "You ride in there on your white horse."<eos> - Not us.<eos> - I'll pay you.<eos> Do you have the money?<eos> Okay, technically, I'd owe you.
Please let me take your facial recog.<eos> Oh, sure, honey.<eos> I just need to get a scan of those beautiful baby browns.<eos> Sure.<eos> Welcome back, Ms. Devereaux.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um?<eos> - Ellis.<eos> - Ellis.<eos> Allow me to escort you to your safety deposit unit.
- The needle was poisoned as we suspected.<eos> One scratch, and you would've died within hours.<eos> Who is this man?<eos> Apparently, he was a classmate and a friend of your brother's.<eos> This is what you get when you try to rule through fear alone.<eos> Discontent is growing.<eos> Teku is overreacting.<eos> You don't see it because you don't venture beyond these walls.<eos> I do.<eos> The people want to love you, Emperor.
Theoretically, yes.<eos> But we don't yet fully understand how to control it.<eos> It certainly hasn't been calibrated for anything as large as this station.<eos> Well then, I suggest you calibrate it quickly, because you don't have time to wait for reinforcements.<eos> If you take the station back to Zairon, you won't have to.<eos> This is a clone body.<eos> I don't care if it gets destroyed.<eos> I doubt you feel the same way about your own.<eos> And make no mistake.<eos> The people who are coming won't hesitate to kill you to get what they want.

Nuke intercepted and destroyed.<eos> The ships are exchanging fire.<eos> The Ferrous Corp ship is jumping to FTL.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Open up a comm line to the other vessel.<eos> Cepheus-5, this is the "Raza."<eos> You're welcome.<eos> We received word that Ferrous Corp had started launching strikes on rival assets in the outer colonies.<eos> Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.<eos> Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.
Where is Han-Shireikan?<eos> Off-world.<eos> She's meeting with General Caius.<eos> Respectfully, Misaki's role is not to act as mediator between you and your generals.<eos> Her duty is here at the court, protecting her emperor.<eos> Her emperor is perfectly capable of protecting himself.<eos> Besides, her temporary absence is... better for the both of us.<eos> You know, you surprise me.<eos> I thought you'd be pleased.<eos> I mean, it's obvious there's no love lost between you two.
Go to talk to them.<eos> You're telling us to go over there, trust them not to shoot us on sight, and hope they're willing to talk?<eos> Not you.<eos> Me.<eos> That's far enough.<eos> I'm unarmed.<eos> Just here to talk.<eos> Right.<eos> The crew of The Raza, just stopping by to pick up a friend.<eos> We should've blasted you out of the sky when we had the chance.
That's far enough.<eos> I'm unarmed.<eos> Just here to talk.<eos> Right.<eos> The crew of The Raza, just stopping by to pick up a friend.<eos> We should've blasted you out of the sky when we had the chance.<eos> Look, I'm here to help.<eos> Sure you are.<eos> Whether you wanna admit it or not, you and your security team are screwed.<eos> The workers have turned against you.
Three workers were killed, including Zem.<eos> And they think we did it?<eos> You tried to arrest him, and failed.<eos> That doesn't mean we wanted him dead.<eos> He was their leader.<eos> You wanted him out of the picture.<eos> We're security contingent.<eos> Our job is to protect Traugott assets, and that includes those workers.<eos> Now we don't wanna start anything, but if they come at us, you can be damn sure we'll be ready for 'em.<eos> Traugott doesn't care about you or this damn colony.

But someone...<eos> Someone has to pay for this.<eos> And they will, but not with their lives.<eos> Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.<eos> What?<eos> Where's Turrence?<eos> So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?<eos> Yeah. I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.<eos> Have to say, you surprise me.<eos> Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
We were finding you an out, a way to get your freedom maybe without having to deal with reprisals.<eos> You should've listened to us.<eos> Now we have to clean up your mess.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> You think I set you up?<eos> You're saying your people just happened to be<eos> - waiting out there?<eos> - Those weren't my people.<eos> A good man is dead,<eos> - because he trusted you.
- I had nothing do with it.<eos> Say it again.<eos> Say it again!<eos> Tell me how you had nothing to do with it.<eos> Convince me, because if you don't, I'm gonna put a bullet in your head, and end you!<eos> Why go through all the trouble?<eos> I could've just gotten into my shuttle, and leveled this place with a couple of well-placed missiles.<eos> You think about it, that would've been a best-case scenario for those workers.<eos> They get their independence, and the big bad crew of the "Raza" add to their rep.<eos> I wasn't playing you.
Uh, so who's going to make that particular house call?<eos> - Me and Three.<eos> - I wanna help.<eos> And you will, by staying here and keeping an eye on things.<eos> Make sure nobody does anything stupid.<eos> Warn us if they try.<eos> I'll stay here and back up the kid.<eos> The kid?<eos> Y-younger person.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Don't listen to this man.<eos> He's a liar and a mass murderer.<eos> He's responsible for the deaths of 10,000 innocent civilians on the Hyadum-12 space station.<eos> Well, I'm not the only one responsible for that particular attack.<eos> But I don't deny it, because those civilians weren't so innocent.<eos> They're complicit in a system that supports inequality and favors corporate rights over the rights of the workers.<eos> And yes...<eos> I've shed blood, and I have no regrets, because I fight for the weak, the defenseless, the downtrodden.<eos> I fight for the oppressed.<eos> And I will fight for you.
You don't belong here.<eos> I was invited.<eos> - By who?<eos> - By me.<eos> He helped other colonies gain their independence, and he'll do the same for us.<eos> You people stood up to the corp system.<eos> That takes guts.<eos> But you're gonna need a lot more than that if you're gonna survive what's coming.<eos> You're gonna need organization, leadership.<eos> That's something that I can give you.
- The General.<eos> He's rounded up prisoners, and he's g...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Wait, Six. Wait.<eos> Six!<eos> This is the price to be paid for trying to take away our freedom.<eos> Well, well, speak of the devil.<eos> He and his people are outsiders.<eos> They work as hired guns for the corporations.<eos> They seem to think they can come here and tell you what's best for you.
The journey to Inari-7 should take less than 48 hours.<eos> In this time, you'll be questioned regarding any anti-imperial acts you may have witnessed or any suspicions you may have regarding neighbors' or friends' loyalty.<eos> We're loyal to Emperor Ishida!<eos> Our people have proudly served the royal court for generations.<eos> And yet one of your fellow clansmen plotted to kill our beloved emperor.<eos> None of us had prior knowledge of his intentions.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> You have no right to keep us here.<eos> We're following the emperor's orders.<eos> Are you questioning his right to rule over you?
Gideon.<eos> He's the one in charge.<eos> Think we can convince him?<eos> What, you worried all this ain't enough?<eos> [sighs] [indistinct chatter]<eos> Rumor has it you're the one in charge here...<eos> Aside from our Ishida captors, that is.<eos> I look after my people as best I can.<eos> And that includes most everyone we came on board with...<eos> Except you two.

How?<eos> Getting you off this ship, for starters.<eos> That assassination attempt made the emperor look weak.<eos> Now he's gonna make a big show of stamping out any disloyalty.<eos> Like it or not, you're a part of that show.<eos> And by "show," she's talking about a very public round of executions just to prove to everyone he's still in charge.<eos> Even if we could escape, where would we go?<eos> We got contacts in the Outer Colonies, the ones that have recently declared independence.<eos> And they'd help us?<eos> They already agreed to take you in.

Create a distraction so we can take out the guards.<eos> Then we'll deal with the rest.<eos> But we can help you take the bridge.<eos> You'll just get in the way...<eos> and probably get killed.<eos> At least let us free our friends from the other cargo holds.<eos> This needs to go down quick and quiet.<eos> If they discover any of us are missing, they'll enact a lockdown, and then we're all screwed.<eos> We'll handle it.<eos> She's going with you.

You should have seen them, yakking on like old friends.<eos> Yeah, old friends until we double-cross her.<eos> Incoming transmission.<eos> - Get out.<eos> - All right.<eos> [beeping]<eos> Two. [sighs]<eos> I should've known.<eos> Hello, Emperor.<eos> What can I do for you?
Remember, we are supposed to be friendly.<eos> Put it away.<eos> [door clanking and hissing]<eos> This way, grunts.<eos> Truffault said you'd have information about the drop.<eos> Here you go.<eos> This planet is in Traugott territory.<eos> That a problem?<eos> Not for us.<eos> No information about the cargo we're hauling for you?
Yeah.<eos> I know.<eos> But that doesn't mean he isn't missing you too.<eos> [pinging]<eos> Maybe that's him now.<eos> Commander Truffault.<eos> What the hell is your crew playing at?<eos> [dramatic music]<eos> ♪ [engines rumbling]<eos> I'm telling you, we haven't stolen an Ishida cruiser or taken delivery of any missiles.
Well, look who's stepping up.<eos> I didn't think you had it in you.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> Wait, how did you get this transmission channel?<eos> Truffault called me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Stealing an Ishida cruiser?<eos> Heisting a shipment of cutting-edge missiles?<eos> Ah, we saw an opportunity, so we took it.<eos> And it never occurred to you to give your representation a heads-up?
I'm warning you!<eos> Drop it.<eos> The other Portia.<eos> I was hoping I'd get the chance to see you again.<eos> You should be careful what you wish for.<eos> Now drop the weapon.<eos> Actually, I think you should drop yours.<eos> Oh?<eos> Why's that?<eos> Because if you don't, my team in the trees will take you all out.
We all hitched a ride when your "Raza"<eos> made the jump back to this reality:<eos> me, Portia, Boone, Tash, The Android.<eos> - What about Corso?<eos> - Not so much. He's not really a team player.<eos> Right. Well, what have you and your team been up to since you came here?<eos> Taking it easy, seeing some sights.<eos> There's a lovely adults-only botanical garden on Rigel-9.<eos> Also setting up this score.<eos> Right. Well, I'm sorry it didn't work out for you.
Air seems to be a little bit light.<eos> Activate the emergency life-support systems right now.<eos> [breathing heavily]<eos> [groans]<eos> Actually, we did see it coming.<eos> [blaster fires]<eos> [whooshing]<eos> A ship just dropped out of FTL.<eos> It's the other "Raza."<eos> What took you so long?
Minus a modest service charge.<eos> We don't work for free.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant.<eos> That'll be all.<eos> It would have been nice if you'd actually captured your impersonators.<eos> They could cause further problems moving forward.<eos> Yes, I'm well aware of that.<eos> Tracking them down will be our next priority.<eos> In the meantime, I'll have my office work up a new authentication protocol,<eos> - just for you.

Commander, don't leave.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, Mr. Maro?
- You told them?<eos> - No. I didn't think it was right to get their hopes up.<eos> Too late for that.<eos> You guys taking a little trip?<eos> Yeah, we're off to Rasnov-4, courtesy of Commander Truffault.<eos> What's on Rasnov-4?<eos> My cousin.<eos> Plus, it's in Mikkei territory, so should be relatively safe for a while.<eos> You guys have to understand, I do have other clients out there.<eos> As much as I'd love to, I can't just be working with you exclusively.
Word is they're looking to target all the independent colonies, wipe the slate clean so that they can take over when the war ends.<eos> What the hell is the G.A. gonna do about it?<eos> What they can.<eos> We've set up patrols to monitor the situation, but this corporate war has stretched us mighty thin.<eos> We can't be everywhere at once.<eos> - I know why you're there, and I've got news for you.<eos> Somehow Kal survived the attack on that planet.<eos> He's alive?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I've been monitoring intercorporate communications for any mention of you and your crew.
Six, you're scaring me.<eos> You all tried a little too hard to convince me to give up that location.<eos> We're just trying to help those people.<eos> Trying to help people out of the goodness of your own heart?<eos> That alone should have set off the alarm bells.<eos> The neurotoxin has compromised your judgment.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought at first, but then little things weren't making sense, the labels, the monitors.<eos> I couldn't read them.<eos> I realize now that...<eos> I can imagine this, and I can imagine all of you.
Gentleman, do we have the information?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But we're close.<eos> You assured it wouldn't be a problem.<eos> It won't be.<eos> It's just a little... trickier than we'd anticipated.<eos> We've had to increase the level of detail in order to convince the subject that he's...<eos> The last thing I need is to be managing a war on two fronts.<eos> The initial test on Agent Zero was promising, but this campaign against the rebellion won't be considered a success until they've all been dealt with.<eos> I'm counting on you.
All squads, this is Tarkanian.<eos> Boone's escaped.<eos> He's armed and extremely dangerous.<eos> He'll most likely head for their shuttle,<eos> - so be ready.<eos> - You can't kill him.<eos> - If he attacks any of our men...<eos> - He's not thinking straight.<eos> You saw it yourself.<eos> We've been cooperating with you.
We got two of the prisoners.<eos> Boone?<eos> And Varrick, yes, ma'am.<eos> Kill them.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Boone killed Commander Tarkanian.<eos> He's a psychopath.<eos> The others can't be trusted.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> I told you.
When the Android was time-jumping, one of the future visions she experienced involved Two.<eos> That means she has to be alive.<eos> We will get her back.<eos> I've changed the timeline once.<eos> Who's to say it can't happen again?<eos> I don't know if we changed the timeline so much as...<eos> Fulfilled destiny.<eos> Three.<eos> Five.<eos> We need you on the bridge.
- What the hell do you want?<eos> I think the real question is, who do you want?<eos> - You have her.<eos> - Two is presently a guest<eos> - of the royal court.<eos> - You're a bastard.<eos> - We're not giving you the Blink Drive.<eos> - Oh, I didn't expect you to.<eos> That easily.<eos> So I'd like the opportunity to argue my case and convince you.
Those former colonies owe their membership to you.<eos> You own them.<eos> They may disagree with that assertion as well.<eos> Silence them, kill the proposed embargo, and uphold your end of the deal, because once this war ends,<eos> Ferrous Corp will settle its accounts, and when that time comes, you want to be on the right side of the ledger.<eos> Pardon me, Heika.<eos> You summoned me, but I did not want to interrupt.<eos> Your presence is always welcome, Teku.<eos> Come in.<eos> I wanted to inform you that the royal guard will be conducting a search of every room in the palace, including yours.
- Our enemy grows more desperate.<eos> - So do our own people.<eos> The hardships of war have led some to do the unthinkable and take up arms against their own emperor.<eos> I'm fairly certain that these were the actions of a disaffected resident and not some professional assassin in the service of Pyr.<eos> You must take steps to ensure this does not happen again.<eos> And I will.<eos> By making an example of the guilty parties.<eos> But that will only inflame their friends and family.<eos> Then I'll cast a wider net.<eos> And turn even more of your own people against you.
Let this attempt on my life go unanswered?<eos> Apprehend the individual, but, more importantly, identify the cause.<eos> Find a way to address these issues, because for every one of them that acts, there are a thousand more steeling themselves in the shadows.<eos> Heika, you are receiving a transmission from the "Raza."<eos> Are you accepting my invitation?<eos> We'll come to Zairon.<eos> On one condition.<eos> I'll be monitoring your vitals throughout your journey.<eos> If I detect any signs of distress,<eos> I'll pull you out immediately.
Then why'd you come?<eos> I'm taking you to meet someone.<eos> Five.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - You shouldn't have come.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We used transfer transit.<eos> - Who's "we"?<eos> - Three, Six, and me.<eos> I will leave you to your privacy.
It's a 600-year-old Japanese whiskey from Shimamoto, Osaka, on Terra Prime.<eos> There are less than 12 of these bottles in existence...<eos> I've always admired your simplicity.<eos> There's no facade.<eos> With you, what you see is what you get.<eos> Top me up, will you?<eos> So I feel I can be brutally honest with you without fear of offending.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm prepared to kill Two.<eos> In fact, I'm prepared to kill all of you, eventually, if you don't give up the Blink Drive.
- He is.<eos> And so am I.<eos> You know what he's doing, don't you?<eos> - He's trying to divide us.<eos> - On the contrary.<eos> Nothing would make me happier than for you to unanimously agree to accept my offer.<eos> Thirty million bars.<eos> And, maybe, a secret or four.<eos> What secrets?<eos> Having my memories makes me privy to information related to each one of you.
He's nowhere to be found.<eos> What about your guests?<eos> The emperor has ordered us to execute the prisoners.<eos> Find them.<eos> His war room's this way.<eos> At least let one of us go with you.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - These are clone bodies.<eos> If you guys don't get the message out, it won't matter if I reach the hangar.<eos> - I'll see you back on the ship. - Yeah.
A leader this empire desperately needs.<eos> Not an indecisive weakling.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Sounds like the locals have breached the perimeter.<eos> - You coming?<eos> - Yeah, I'm coming.<eos> Just want to make sure you guys get out okay.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - I'll be right behind you.
We may have a death sentence coming our way soon, but he has one today.<eos> Make no mistake, this was a hate crime, so let him feel our hate!<eos> Yeah! Let's kill him.<eos> You ok with all this?<eos> They're just blowing off steam.<eos> Blowing off steam?<eos> Is that what we were doing when we strung up Murphy for killing Wells?<eos> - Pour. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Against someone who tried to kill us!<eos> They listen to you.

We need to see if we can pick up their trail.<eos> Trikru burn their dead.<eos> They're still here.<eos> Back up now.<eos> There is no one here.<eos> They've taken the truck.<eos> The fuel. Clarke.<eos> If you're such a good tracker, go track.<eos> You were saying?<eos> I don't want to shoot you.
The Brits are moving north to fight the Germans at Saint Quentin.<eos> You don't happen to know a doctor by the name of Henry Ayers, do you?<eos> I'm an old friend.<eos> I was hoping to bump into him before he left Paris.<eos> Henry Ayers? You're friends with that scoundrel?<eos> So I take it he's a bit sinister, yeah?<eos> I could tell you some stories.<eos> Henry, my love!<eos> How about one last drink for the road?<eos> Careful, he'll sucker you into paying for the round.
Pleased to meet you.<eos> John.<eos> Well, don't be rude. You don't recognize your friend?<eos> It's quite all right.<eos> I am cursed with a familiar face.<eos> And I'm cursed to never forget them.<eos> Are you sure we've met?<eos> In all truth, no.<eos> No, we've not met.<eos> But I've come to find you because I used to know your mother, Pauline Ayers.
You spent all this time getting close to her.<eos> It's only natural.<eos> But her family destroyed ours.<eos> We lost everything.<eos> Don't forget that.<eos> It's our turn now.<eos> My mother moved back to Stockport right before I was born.<eos> Did you work with her at the hospital?<eos> I was doing my residency then, and Pauline was kind to me.<eos> She spoke so highly of you.

What is it you do?<eos> I'm an assistant curator at the Space Museum, Or I am until I get fired, which could be any day now if I keep calling in sick.<eos> So, um, what are you looking for?<eos> I requested all the images for March 30th thinking maybe I could give us some information that would help us in 1918, but all that is pointless, given that I'm here and not in Paris.<eos> Yeah. Um, World War I was a dangerous time.<eos> I wouldn't put a woman I cared about in danger like that.<eos> Am I the only one here that's living in the 21st century?<eos> No one wants to put someone they love in danger.<eos> I wouldn't say H.G. loves me.<eos> Well, I've seen you two together.

It's time.<eos> I don't want you to go.<eos> I must.<eos> But I'll be back soon.<eos> Do you promise?<eos> Yeah, good lad!<eos> You'll never convince Henry to dessert his comrades.<eos> Then I'll have to use other means to stop him.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen, but I'm afraid I must take my leave.<eos> When this is all over, I'll look you up in Stockport.
David was a brilliant scientist, but he was young, impatient.<eos> Some of the medications he patented... They saved the company from financial ruin, but he didn't do the original research.<eos> Did he steal the research?<eos> He never admitted it, but I did suspect.<eos> There was no name on the files other than "Utopia."<eos> And after your parents were killed, the original hard copies vanished.<eos> Well, there must be something left.<eos> I still have everything I brought from... from the lab when I retired.<eos> But such a long time ago, Vanessa.<eos> It's... It's unlikely, I'm afraid, that I have anything that can help you, but, I'll look.
I only need a moment.<eos> Pardon me, sir.<eos> I don't think you understand.<eos> I'm deploying to war.<eos> One, sir.<eos> I have urgent news from your father.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> My father doesn't even know I was born.<eos> I swear on my life he does.<eos> He sent me to find you.
How do you know my father?<eos> Just... come with me for a moment.<eos> I'll tell you everything.<eos> - Allonsy! - All right, men, let's move out!<eos> What's so important my father couldn't say it to me himself?<eos> Your transport is going to be ambushed.<eos> You and your men will be dead before you even make it to the front.<eos> You're mad.<eos> Where did you get this information?<eos> I can't say, but your father sent me here to help you.
Lost track of H.G.?<eos> Has he not given you the bad news?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I won.<eos> The transport left without him.<eos> I saved Henry's life.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I hope that makes you very happy.<eos> What's this you're holding?<eos> That has nothing to do with you.
How could I?<eos> Do you know what the punishment is for treason?<eos> You came back!<eos> John pulled me off the transport.<eos> Everyone else is dead.<eos> Please be okay.<eos> I tried to stop it.<eos> You need a doctor.<eos> Jane, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm getting you to the time machine.
John pulled me off the transport.<eos> Everyone else is dead.<eos> Please be okay.<eos> I tried to stop it.<eos> You need a doctor.<eos> Jane, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm getting you to the time machine.<eos> It's coming soon, okay?<eos> Okay. Come on.<eos> We have to get you out of here.
You told me yourself.<eos> Now, prove it.<eos> Prove it.<eos> His eyes are dilated.<eos> Could have brain swelling or internal bleeding.<eos> He needs a hospital.<eos> Help me get him to the time machine. I'm not going back!<eos> Yes.<eos> You have to.<eos> There's nothing left for you here. Please.
Thank you for getting him home.<eos> Vanessa Anders, I assume.<eos> We finally meet.<eos> Where are you putting him?<eos> The basement for now.<eos> I saved Wells.<eos> Isn't that worth anything?<eos> Doesn't erase what you've done... or who you are.<eos> I suppose not.<eos> Well, it was nice to meet you.

I do hope to see you again.<eos> Where are we?<eos> 2017.<eos> We did it.<eos> And what of John?<eos> Vanessa has him locked up.<eos> And his son, Henry?<eos> He died.<eos> John didn't change anything.<eos> He did help bring you back.
We had to insert this tube in your arm.<eos> This is a very impressive anesthetic.<eos> I feel very lightheaded.<eos> And good.<eos> Jane, I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> II didn't wish to be an oinking pig.<eos> A sexistoinking pig.<eos> I'm sorry if my behavior offends you.

But out of the ashes we start anew.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> My name is Jeremiah Otto.<eos> And this is the end of the world as we know it.<eos> The only way to protect your family is to be prepared.<eos> There you go.<eos> The best way to ready yourself is with my four-part video series,<eos> How to Survive TEOTWAWKI: The End of the World as We Know It.<eos> After decades of running my own cattle ranch and living off the land, I've developed this proprietary system for surviving T.E.<eos> My series will teach you how to stockpile food, ammo, tools, medical supplies, and barter goods.

You a hard woman to like, Madison?<eos> I'm extremely goddamn hard to like when someone threatens my family, and that's what Troy did.<eos> That's fact.<eos> If Jake hadn't shown up at the depot, we'd be dead.<eos> That's fact.<eos> And it's something no one here seems to give a shit about.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. No need to curse.<eos> He murdered people, and he called it science.<eos> Maybe the ranch should know that.<eos> Yeah, I'm starting to grasp why folks' fondness fails when it comes to you, Madison.
I'm assuming... Thomas did not...?<eos> So, you escaped this hotel in this crazy woman's car, and all you have with you are your wits and charms and this crunchy suede coat?<eos> Don't forget my good looks, Dante.<eos> Well, it's nice to be back with a like mind.<eos> He wants to know where you're from.<eos> El Sereno, Los Angeles, California, America, North America, Earth.<eos> Geoff wants to know what it's like out there.<eos> Chaos.<eos> Ruin.<eos> And it changes you.
You want to know why I tolerate my son?<eos> Come on, take a walk.<eos> Such. Such. Such.<eos> - Fass, fass, fass, fass! - Go, go!<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Underneath my house.<eos> My tapes didn't make me the lightning rod I hoped to be, but enough people woke, invested in the vision.<eos> We call this the pantry.<eos> Some say this mess we're in is Revelations, God's vengeance.<eos> I'll tell you what it is.
A no-fly zone is now in effect around Ganymede Station until further notice.<eos> Ganymede is the most important food station out here.<eos> They're not going to let it just collapse.<eos> This station is dead already.<eos> This is the UNS Arboghast.<eos> We are an unarmed research vessel on a scientific mission as is our right under the Venus Accords.<eos> But I know I saw something.<eos> Yes. A man standing on the surface of Ganymede without a vac suit.<eos> Sorry. You're under restrictions now.<eos> This is what attacked you and your team, isn't it?
I know.<eos> Look, I know exactly how much time's passed.<eos> You need to be ready.<eos> - In case...<eos> - In case we don't find her?<eos> Look, you haven't lost a child.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> My baby boy was taken from me and I tried and I tried to find him and I failed.<eos> It took me a very long time to understand that it wasn't my fault.<eos> Would you have listened to anyone who was telling you what you're telling me now?

It's time you stopped looking for places to project your guilt.<eos> All you need to do now is sit tight, keep your mouth shut, and go home.<eos> Transport's on its way.<eos> It'll be here in a few hours.<eos> You make sure your bags are packed.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> You lied to me about Ganymede.<eos> You all lied about Travis.<eos> You've been lying to me this whole time!<eos> That's what's bothering you?

This will buy us passage off this ice-ball.<eos> Then go.<eos> Cascade?<eos> Looks like the word's out.<eos> Mirror.<eos> I need to speak to Captain Martens.<eos> Come.<eos> What's on your mind, Sergeant?<eos> My dad.<eos> He's going to be very disappointed in you.
Mirror.<eos> I need to speak to Captain Martens.<eos> Come.<eos> What's on your mind, Sergeant?<eos> My dad.<eos> He's going to be very disappointed in you.<eos> You should prepare for that.<eos> He told you that story?<eos> About the climbing accident?<eos> He was proud of you.

In an unrehearsed battlefield demonstration, a single unarmed Version 1 Hybrid easily defeated six UN marines and then four Martian marines equipped with the latest Goliath Mark IV power armor.<eos> The drone.<eos> You were watching.<eos> The Hybrid covered more than two kilometers on the ground...<eos> You watched that thing slaughter my team.<eos> We were a God damn sales demo.<eos> Did you get a good deal?<eos> Put in an order?<eos> It was for the good of Mars.<eos> Captain Martens needs to see you.
So, what do you think?<eos> Why do you pretend that you care about my opinion?<eos> - Indulge me.<eos> - It's a fucking trap.<eos> You're so predictable.<eos> And so are you.<eos> You've already made up your mind, haven't you?<eos> Then change it.<eos> His crimes are public knowledge.<eos> He has nothing to gain by killing you.

Previously on The Expanse...<eos> Those cops were going to kill them both.<eos> - Oh, God...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Get off my ship.<eos> You're the only person that knows the truth about Errinwright, the only person anyone might actually believe.<eos> And that puts you in a precarious position.
Don't refuse this offer.<eos> It won't be repeated.<eos> That's the protomolecule.<eos> Don't touch it<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What do you think?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> That's someone's child.<eos> I came here to destroy the protomolecule and that's what I'm going to do.<eos> I'm not going with you
All right.<eos> We never really get a chance in the morning to just talk, you know?<eos> Just hang out.<eos> You okay, Dad?<eos> I never really did tell you that...<eos> I was sorry that I had to leave your mother.<eos> You know, you're at an age now when time is just gonna...<eos> You're just going to put your head down and...<eos> "Whoosh."<eos> And all the old farts like me, we're all going to be telling you this is how you do it and this is the path you take.
I can help you unload.<eos> That's not necessary.<eos> We wanna work for our passage.<eos> Please be advised that water systems in Sector Three are no longer in service.<eos> Once again, water systems in Sector Three are no longer in service.<eos> You're not welcome on my ship.<eos> We don't want a ride.<eos> I want to fix your ship.<eos> Your panel was shot to shit.<eos> Thanks to you.
- That doesn't go there.<eos> - Who the hell are you?<eos> Please put those down, and step away from the panel, right now.<eos> The hell I will...<eos> Station power's failing.<eos> There's no time for this shit.<eos> Move! Move!<eos> So where's the old lady?<eos> I was told...<eos> It's Madam Undersecretary to you.
Station power's failing.<eos> There's no time for this shit.<eos> Move! Move!<eos> So where's the old lady?<eos> I was told...<eos> It's Madam Undersecretary to you.<eos> Or just Madam.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> You're with us because you betrayed your oath.<eos> Is that a habit for you?
You're with us because you betrayed your oath.<eos> Is that a habit for you?<eos> Now, I'll be polite, but I'm short on time.<eos> I have never crossed anyone first.<eos> But burn me and mine and I'll go through you like a door.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We have confirmed rendezvous coordinates for Mr. Mao's ship.<eos> We will be departing momentarily.<eos> Nice of you to join us.
We have confirmed rendezvous coordinates for Mr. Mao's ship.<eos> We will be departing momentarily.<eos> Nice of you to join us.<eos> Just making sure they didn't lose our luggage.<eos> When was the last time you left Earth?<eos> None of your goddamn business.<eos> Thought so.<eos> When you mysteriously vanish, no one will ever find your body.<eos> We used to use that for target practice.<eos> Ah, this must be weird for you.

So let's not over-think it.<eos> How far are we gonna take this, Jim?<eos> Got it!<eos> No, please...<eos> That is not your kid!<eos> Not anymore!<eos> All this death?<eos> It's not the protomolecule.<eos> It's Protogen.<eos> And men like you.
And they'll be coming faster now.<eos> That's not good.<eos> We open that door and announce we're taking 50 on a ship that fits 300, they'll tear each other apart and us.<eos> I'll call the Roci.<eos> Get Holden to come back.<eos> You can't.<eos> The Martian ships have jammed all our comms.<eos> So we load up everyone and when our ship comes back, we transfer the overflow to the Rocinante.<eos> And when your ship doesn't come back, you want to suffocate slow with a couple hundred people?<eos> I trusted you to repair my ship, don't ask me to trust James Holden.
Well, sir, you're in luck.<eos> Scottish gold.<eos> It's 107 years old.<eos> Found in a shipwreck off Scapa Flow.<eos> 107 years old...<eos> I love that about Earth.<eos> Well, you know what, you take that bottle.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> But as for the protomolecule, Sergeant Draper was witness to a game-changing technology, and there can't be peace if one of us has it and not the other.<eos> I understand you, Pyotr, because...
And yet, here we are, using it.<eos> You give a monkey a stick, inevitably he'll beat another monkey to death with it.<eos> You were right.<eos> One of us has to lose.<eos> Help!<eos> I need help!<eos> Get a medic! Get a medic!<eos> Security scans are complete.<eos> We are clear to dock.<eos> Madam Avasarala, we'll meet you at the airlock.
No wonder you ended up in her world.<eos> Actually, I got her son killed.<eos> Madam, I am Captain Malik.<eos> Welcome aboard the Guanshiyin.<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> My aides.<eos> It's a beautiful ship.<eos> Earth has been very good to Mr. Mao.<eos> Do you like cucumbers?<eos> I was going to ask you where you got those lovely couches, but I don't want to run out of sparkling conversation before your boss joins us.
Something fell out of orbit.<eos> Something big.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop! Get back!<eos> Naomi, get ready to push off.<eos> There's nothing we can do.<eos> You even arrested my cousin.<eos> He's a monk.<eos> When you exonerate my family, unconditionally, unfreeze my assets, we'll talk about how I can help keep Earth and Mars from blowing up this whole goddamn system.<eos> And I'll remind you, I chose to work with Earth first.
It's that simple.<eos> A lovely thought.<eos> But when parents fight, the child has a crisis of loyalty.<eos> You've got that backwards, madame.<eos> Earth and Mars are the children here, screaming for their trinkets.<eos> Blind to a miracle...<eos> What is it?<eos> Sir, an urgent tight-beam from Secretary Errinwright.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - It's for you, sir.
Time is short, and I'll be brief.<eos> Martian Defense Minister Korshunov suffered a fatal heart attack earlier this evening.<eos> Simultaneously, the MCRN Karakum, dispatched by Korshunov to take delivery of your protomolecule technology was destroyed over Ganymede.<eos> And I gave the order.<eos> And I can give the same order to end your life where you breathe at the same coordinates I'm sending this message.<eos> You led him right to me...<eos> Don't be an idiot.<eos> Monsieur Mao...<eos> There were two men in the entire universe who could protect your protomolecule project, and now Korshunov is dead.<eos> I can assure you I'm the only friend you have left and do not test my resolve on this.
Give her to me I'll make her talk.<eos> Fifty two people.<eos> Help me save that many.<eos> Get back!<eos> Everybody back!<eos> Get back!<eos> Go!<eos> Where is your pride, beltalowdas?<eos> We are tougher than anyone in the system.<eos> Every single one of you knew, you were certain, on the day you were born, our life is hard.
So that's what I did.<eos> All true, Mr. Williams, but your gun has dried blood on it, and...<eos> It's not my gun.<eos> Whose gun is it?<eos> I don't really know. I found it.<eos> Where?<eos> Well... I was waiting for the bus early this morning, and I... I threw away some chewing gum, and it was laying right...<eos> Right there in a... A trash barrel.<eos> Your heart seems to be in the right place, Mr. Williams, but this story, to be honest, sounds like BS.<eos> I'm telling you, it isn't mine.

I'll be telling them about your daughter.<eos> Taking them through what happened to her that day.<eos> It may be hard for you to hear.<eos> We'll be all right.<eos> If you need to step out at any time...<eos> We live with this every single day.<eos> I was holding Lara's hand... when the shooting started.<eos> The sidewalk outside our home where she was shot...<eos> - The blood is still...<eos> - I'm really sorry to do this to you, Mrs. Haley, but it helps that you're here.
Yeah, it's all good.<eos> Look. Do me a favor.<eos> Drop me off on Ashland.<eos> I don't wanna be rolling' up on my block with PD.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> You're getting door-to-door service.<eos> You heard your lawyer.<eos> Get inside, stay inside.<eos> Yeah. All right.<eos> We'll be back to pick you up Friday morning.
About the size of a gun?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> And when he left here, he was wearing Andre's clothes.<eos> Why didn't you tell this to our investigators?<eos> All right, look.<eos> You have to understand.<eos> Keo is my sister's only child.<eos> All right?<eos> Family.<eos> But between you and me, kid's been in some trouble before.
This is nothing new.<eos> It's just high tech profiling.<eos> Using race-neutral criteria.<eos> Felony histories, gang affiliations.<eos> Who's in the gangs?<eos> The shooters.<eos> People of color.<eos> Lara Haley was a person of color.<eos> I can't get their guns, but maybe I can get the phones they're using to help kill each other, or any other innocent kid who just happens to be nearby.<eos> I'm not gonna pull the plug on you, Peter.

Tell him.<eos> Keo's been calling me about the gun.<eos> He got up in my face at school yesterday.<eos> Told me that he needed his gun back.<eos> Then he came by the house later, and started pounding on the door.<eos> I pretended I wasn't home, but I'm afraid if I go back to school tomorrow, something bad might happen.<eos> This is all gonna work out.<eos> We're gonna charge Keo with murder.<eos> His visit to your apartment the other day, and the blood on the gun you turned in are key pieces of evidence.<eos> But we can't proceed without you.
We can offer you both some protection.<eos> Protection.<eos> That sounds like a fine idea sitting up here in this nice law office.<eos> I'm sure you've got programs, protocols, whatever.<eos> But it's the law of the street we talking about now.<eos> These kids still paying back grudges from five years ago.<eos> So what are you going to do?<eos> We'll stay with some friends in Wrigleyville for a few days.<eos> After that, I don't know.<eos> But I've done all I can do for you now.
My grandparents lived in this small town in eastern Tennessee.<eos> And I went down there many years ago to talk to this lawyer who was drafting their wills.<eos> The walls of his offices were lined with paintings of trees.<eos> What kind of trees?<eos> He'd painted every tree in the county where a black man was lynched.<eos> Black kids killing black kids.<eos> This is 300 years in the making.<eos> It doesn't mean we can't try to make things better.<eos> Better has to come from the inside.<eos> Not from politicians like me, or do-gooders like you.
Stone was cross-examining a witness, and while I was waiting there, I saw Cathridge was fidgeting with something under the defense table.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - It was suspicious, and I thought about alerting one the deputies, but Cathridge would see it coming.<eos> So I tip-toed into the well, handed the brief to Peter's second chair, and as I was walking out, I flipped over the defense table.<eos> Before anyone knew what was going on, there were four deputies on top of Cathridge, one had me in a choke hold until I could point them to the razorblade Cathridge had wedged under the table.<eos> If you want the right results, sometimes you have to do something unorthodox.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> Who is it?<eos> Peoples Gas, ma'am.<eos> Sorry to disturb you, but I'm checking on a gas leak.
So what do you say?<eos> Who is it?<eos> Peoples Gas, ma'am.<eos> Sorry to disturb you, but I'm checking on a gas leak.<eos> No gas in here.<eos> Either you let me in to check it out, or I go downstairs to shut off your gas and electric.<eos> State's Attorney, Mrs. Vincent.<eos> You tricked me.<eos> What's going on, Ma?<eos> I got nothing to say to you.
- Hands behind your back!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Let me go, man!<eos> - Let me go, man.<eos> - Stay down.<eos> I didn't do nothing to that girl.<eos> You're sure he's the one who killed our daughter?<eos> I am now.<eos> Sometimes you have to make a wrong turn before you find your way.<eos> I'm sorry to put you through this again.
Had my own business and all that sort of stuff.<eos> At the end of the day, the city wasn't my cup of tea, so I left.<eos> I had many, many good times in the city and I also had lot of hard times in the city.<eos> But to me, the city's dead and gone.<eos> I had my time there, I've come back here...<eos> Country's me.<eos> Well, here we've got no traffic lights for a start off.<eos> Got some really good mates here.<eos> Everybody knows everybody.<eos> You can't even go down the street without someone waving or saying "G'day" to you, you know.
Who leaves someone on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere?<eos> My friend, Sloppy Joe, has a one-engine plane.<eos> He might be able to fly y'all all the way to LA.<eos> Well, that's a wrap on the first day of filming here in Austin, Texas.<eos> So Randy's not in Los Angeles?<eos> He's in Texas?<eos> Wow, you're a bad stalker, Max.<eos> There's two things the Slop won't do.<eos> Alert the proper authorities of my flight pattern or step foot in Texas.<eos> I'll drop you here.
This stops now!<eos> Unless your boy, Han, gets a little taste of the horse-play.<eos> Here.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I know a shady deal when I see one.<eos> I was one of the loudest voices against the Louisiana Purchase.<eos> Earl, what are you even doing here?<eos> I thought you lived at the diner.<eos> Well, thank God the girls asked me to check on Han checking on you too 'cause now this black male is about to blackmail you.
Max, wine in our room sounds so much better.<eos> We can relax and focus on each other for once.<eos> Mm, great.<eos> What's the room number?<eos> Oh.<eos> I think she means oh-six.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> That room is still an active crime scene.<eos> Stowaways, huh?<eos> I'll have the Coast Guard come and pick you up.
Employees are not allowed to gamble.<eos> Or, as of last week, sexually harass each other.<eos> Thanks a lot, Craig.<eos> Ugh. Poindexter in the radio room wouldn't let me use the satellite phone.<eos> Also, I broke your satellite phone.<eos> That is it.<eos> You're fired.<eos> That's the worst news I've heard since you said "you're hired."<eos> There's a tug coming to swap out the toilet tanks.<eos> I am putting you two on it.
So, this is where Randy and the other movie people are staying.<eos> He's been here.<eos> I smell abs.<eos> Ugh, I smell us.<eos> When did I have a hot dog?<eos> I shared one with you while you were sleeping.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Let's ask that clerk if he's seen Randy, and when the outdoor sprinklers go on so we can freshen up.<eos> Hi.<eos> How can I help you?
And I want it to end!<eos> Well, your hobo skills are not complete.<eos> You need to practice peeing in an alley.<eos> You're still splashing on your shoes.<eos> Now come on. Let's go ask that concierge if he knows where it is.<eos> Fine.<eos> Hey, remember us?<eos> The dust bunnies from before?<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I've been following you two around with a wet vac.
Bit of an attitude from someone who's got two giant horns coming out of his head.<eos> You're bringing horny to a whole new level.<eos> Can you please tell us where the movie set is?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> No problem.<eos> Just go out the lobby, make a left on Main, then a right on There's No Way In Hell I'm Telling You That Street.<eos> Uh, was that a left or a right on No Way In Hell I'm Telling You That Street?<eos> My friend came all the way here to surprise her boyfriend.<eos> How would you feel if someone stopped you from seeing your boyfriend?
This place didn't burn down while we were gone like I had hoped.<eos> Oh that sucks.<eos> The night is young, and I have a Roman candle in my pocket.<eos> Hi, welcome to the Williamsburg diner.<eos> Table for two?<eos> Don't be silly, Earl.<eos> It's us, Max and Caroline.<eos> And I'm Earl.<eos> Smoking or nonsmoking?<eos> Glad to have you back.
I mean, what else am I gonna do, hmm?<eos> Stop.<eos> Oleg, stop blocking the door.<eos> We're not on a date with you.<eos> We want to see the dessert bar.<eos> Eh, sure, but before you go in there, do you want to see a cute picture of me, Sophie, and baby Barbara?<eos> Sure.<eos> You didn't say it was in the bathtub.<eos> Well, now that you're annoyed and hopefully a little impressed...<eos> Mm-mm. I can tell you I had to fire your contractor.
Hey, great.<eos> I'll tell the boss you liked it.<eos> "Bobby, you did it again."<eos> In case you missed it, I'm the boss.<eos> See, 'cause he's the boss, so he was telling himself.<eos> It's too many levels for her.<eos> Hey, um, listen, I should probably get going, but if you need anything else, you can call me.<eos> Or my boss.<eos> Anytime.<eos> Well, I might just have to call you both.
You go up there, and you cut off the gangrenous parts.<eos> And then we go in with charter schools and outreach, for about $30 million, we capture the tax write-off, and those kids will be better off than their parents, or we, ever were.<eos> Seize all their assets, property, utilities, machinery, vehicles, buildings.<eos> Everything, even Town fucking Hall.<eos> Jack Foley!<eos> This is how I like to start the day.<eos> Oh, I can't match your enthusiasm at the moment.<eos> Oh? Sorry to hear that.<eos> I've done for you, haven't I?<eos> Recently and at a great profit to you, and yet, your son lets me down.
Can never know.<eos> That was a favor for me.<eos> Yes, I torpedoed Axelrod at your behest, and while Chuck may not know that, he does know that I was planning to help him in Albany.<eos> That should have been more than enough.<eos> I'm throwing in with Bob Sweeney for governor now.<eos> That pains me to hear, Jack.<eos> I-I hope that this, uh...<eos> Ah, don't get it in a twist, Charles.<eos> You and I are fine.<eos> I look forward to seeing you at the party.
- Thanks, Bob.<eos> Back to chasing ambulances, Chuck?<eos> All wrapping wounds and pressing flesh, or have you got a minute?<eos> The state has a lieutenant governor, an AG, influential university presidents.<eos> All are a tick or two ahead of you.<eos> And some of them, Hell, maybe all of them, are gonna get in this thing.<eos> Foley thought you were the one that would cede the most control.<eos> A few months from now, when you and all those others are in the gubernatorial scrum, churning, gasping, drowning on dry land, you know where I'll be?<eos> Sitting in the corner, watching, jerking off.<eos> Gliding above you.
Well, since we're here...<eos> We can wait out here till they're done.<eos> I'm offering to buy your product.<eos> I'm offering to buy the product from all seven of your scrap yards at a considerable premium.<eos> And you're saying no?<eos> I'm saying I already have a buyer.<eos> You didn't take this meeting to tell me no.<eos> Actually, I did.<eos> But to tell you no nicely.<eos> I don't know what's going on between you and Foley, but I know it's enough that you're taking aim on him, and I don't want to do you disrespect because I don't want you taking aim on me.
I'm basically extorting myself.<eos> And I wish I could take advantage, but this isn't a negotiation.<eos> - There's no magic number.<eos> - There's always a number.<eos> Not in this case.<eos> I do business in this state.<eos> I live in this state.<eos> Foley could make both of those more unpleasant than six hours on the cross at Calvary.<eos> I get out of bed one morning and find overnight I'm jammed up with licenses and unions and taxes and he's found a dozen other ways to hurt me I didn't see coming.<eos> I thank you for your offer.
Are you offering me that? No.<eos> I'm not fucking insane.<eos> But you would have taken it.<eos> I do something that's valuable.<eos> I strip people naked to the elements, and then I help rebuild them out of solid fucking rock.<eos> - Now, can you appreciate that? - I can.<eos> Nope.<eos> Don't believe you.<eos> Because if you did, you wouldn't be asking me to snitch.<eos> Axelrod banished you.
He was used to flirting with Wendy Rhoades.<eos> I offered a different kind of medicine.<eos> So I didn't have access to the kind of conversations that you're interested in.<eos> But I know who did.<eos> His chief of staff.<eos> Steph Reed. That's her name.<eos> She was in on every pitch, and she doesn't work there anymore, either.<eos> - Taylor, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> How can I help you?
- Why do you think that is?<eos> - I know why. Because the culture is set from the top.<eos> Since Axe likes me, other people do, or pretend to.<eos> Why do you think he likes you?<eos> One of the two reasons anyone likes anyone else.<eos> Either they recognize a part of themselves, or they see something they can use.<eos> In this case, I imagine it's both.<eos> There's another reason people like each other.<eos> They see something they're lacking, and they want to be near it.<eos> Is that what's between the two of you?
I made a pledge.<eos> To Deb?<eos> You're exclusive?<eos> She's not.<eos> I like your mustache.<eos> I have a mustache?<eos> You ever see guys in here from SoulCycle?<eos> All the time.<eos> Small world when you're tapping it back.<eos> That guy is staring at you.
But that obsession nearly had me out on the street.<eos> So now I have to ask what's the upside?<eos> Seeing that fuck in jail.<eos> You still want that, don't you?<eos> I want to see him in the ground.<eos> But I also want to see myself in Albany and you in here.<eos> So maybe there will be a time when the moment presents itself, and then I'll sign subpoenas and request warrants and we'll mobilize and we will take him.<eos> But that can't be now.<eos> I'm glad I stayed.<eos> I'm glad I let you.

You got into this room, Mr. Axelrod, because I appreciated the, uh, fluidity of your tactics.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But our relationship ends right there.<eos> If we'd come together some other way, I'd feel certain we might have been something like friends, but that can never happen now, despite the rareness of your gifts.<eos> I hold to a code of loyalty, which may very well be outmoded, but has served me well.<eos> And to be honest, I like the way it makes me feel when I choose sides.<eos> Well, that's something I can understand.<eos> Understand this, too, then.<eos> I know you're not satisfied with what you've learned.<eos> Your search will continue, and it may take you down a great number of paths.

You don't look ridiculous.<eos> You look fuckin' hot.<eos> Hello? It's Wendy Rhoades.<eos> I'm sorry to call so late, but I figured<eos> - you'd still be at the office.<eos> - I am. That first question you asked.<eos> Are your feelings about Mafee helpful?<eos> More than any stock you'll ever champion, more than any time you'll impress somebody by being right.<eos> You haven't noticed yet.<eos> By the time anyone notices, it's usually too late, but that place has a way of obscuring, corroding, eating you from the fucking inside.

I don't.<eos> If you start to feel yourself not feeling, do what you did the other day and come find me... before it's too late... for both of us.<eos> I have to go.<eos> - This is how you do it. - Uh-huh.<eos> He's got piss all over his big boy's.<eos> I'm just gonna play one. Uh, maybe two.<eos> Foley doesn't fuck around.<eos> That's Ben Folds.<eos> No, even when he fucks around, he means business.<eos> Mr. Foley would like to see you in the library.

No, he showed me the pictures.<eos> Must have been you.<eos> He'd never go around with photos of the bastards.<eos> He's put a lot of time into you.<eos> My own children didn't have the drive.<eos> Maybe I spoiled them too much.<eos> Had to find other prospects.<eos> But by this point, it's a pretty deep farm system.<eos> I've been drafting blue-chippers, high upsides, and reclamations for three decades.<eos> So why should I sign you off the street?

That's how I do all of it.<eos> Mm. So, what's the trick?<eos> The trick? Hmm.<eos> Well, like most, it's bracingly simple.<eos> You pick the right man, and then you get him the fuck out of his own way so people can actually see him.<eos> Elections aren't about ideas.<eos> Elections are about candidates.<eos> Mm. And candidates are about what's in here.<eos> I am the right man.<eos> I am not going to ask you.
George Minchak.<eos> - Okay. - She vets all of my candidates.<eos> You want her to know everything.<eos> It's a stress test.<eos> - We prepare for what the opposition will use.<eos> I'm not really sure I'm entirely comfortable with that.<eos> My last candidate who did not use her... was Spitzer.<eos> I'll fit her right in.<eos> And we need to do it right now because of the attention this, unofficial campaign visit will bring.<eos> I'd have told you if I'd thought that...
Anything big Axe is wading into,<eos> Taylor's there with a snorkel mask.<eos> I believe it's time, nay, long past time, to transform your charitable arm and engender a permanent foundation.<eos> Properly stewarded, it will write the name of your benevolence on the ages, alongside Carnegie, Vanderbilt. A creation of consequence.<eos> Because otherwise, what's it all for?<eos> Is that right?<eos> I don't pretend to answer that which lies in the realm of the theologians.<eos> Yet you just happened to pitch me legacy on my birthday?<eos> I won't claim happenstance.<eos> This is the time when a man like you allows reflection to dictate action.
What do you make at your current gig?<eos> I prefer not to really get into that.<eos> It's public record, Sean.<eos> Have some dignity and spare us the time.<eos> Two-hundred twenty-five thousand.<eos> Okay. And a, "true steward" of a multi-billion dollar charitable foundation, what would that put me back, Wags?<eos> In the range of $350,000 to $500,000 a year, I think it was.<eos> Yeah. See, I have looked into this before.<eos> And you are not the first one in here looking to double his salary.<eos> But today is your lucky day, because I do want to set up a permanent foundation with you as its steward.
I accept.<eos> With one urgent recommendation.<eos> Cancel your party.<eos> That's direct.<eos> You just offered me enough, so I have to be.<eos> You cannot throw a lavish party at the very moment when you're draining the meager resources of what amounts to a village of apple-cheeked orphans.<eos> That party was organized long before Sandicot got grounded.<eos> A change of course?<eos> That's reactionary.<eos> Weak. I am not hiring you to serve me weak tea.
Something I tell my patients when they're hesitating about making some kind of move in their own life is, sometimes you have to jump in... all the way in to find out.<eos> They are lucky to have you.<eos> It's easy when it's about someone else.<eos> Yeah. It's about you, it's hard to know.<eos> When do you... keep working at it?<eos> When do you... give up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Dollar Bill's telling the truth.<eos> It looks clean.<eos> Even if they trace his burner or get into his air-gapped laptop, like I did, nothing will come back to you, unless somebody talked.
She RSVP'd "no," and I just wanted to make sure she knew that both Bobby and I would really be delighted to see her at the house.<eos> Well, I will certainly pass along your message.<eos> But I do know that she was feeling a lack of... clarity in terms of going.<eos> I'm guessing things are tense and complicated right now, and this can't be helping.<eos> You're not guessing.<eos> I know this is weird.<eos> I was just calling to say... she's back at the company, and the company will all be here, so she should be, too.<eos> You know, if we don't mark the milestones, we're just passing with the time.<eos> Well said.<eos> And I'd invite you as her plus one, but under the circumstances...
- Got you in the office. - No. I'm here because of the other thing.<eos> Your birthday.<eos> Okay. What, specifically, about that?<eos> Your wife asked me to come.<eos> Said you wanted me there.<eos> - I think you know me well enough to know the answer to that question.<eos> Quite a hole you've dig yourself right here in the middle of scenic Kingsford, Thayer.<eos> It's not my best. It's not my worst.<eos> I just have one question, the only question that matters.<eos> Who is Bobby Axelrod to you?
I bet you'd like to put me in that hole... like you used to do it.<eos> Then pour the concrete.<eos> They never find 'em when you do that, do they?<eos> No one wants to tear a whole building down, but you can't now.<eos> Now, you're respectable... ish.<eos> You've changed your narrative.<eos> So let me suggest a new chapter in your story, one in which you are the unindicted co-conspirator rather than a defendant.<eos> Which story is that?<eos> The story of Sandicot.<eos> Let me tell it to you, then you tell it back, if it's true, of course, which it is.

You're some fucking gangster, swaggering up here, making threats.<eos> From you, "fucking gangster" sounds like a compliment.
And you're glad it went this way?<eos> Yeah. Why shouldn't I be?<eos> So before I let you get back to your childhood, the moral of the story is... just get on the fucking plane?<eos> No. The moral of the story is, you get one life, so do it all.<eos> Why did I have Thayer dead to rights, and he wasn't even nervous?<eos> Why were you sitting with Thayer in the first place? How does that help you with headlines, blind items... community leaders?<eos> You weren't encouraging me to be smart.<eos> You were protecting one of your own.<eos> Did you handpick him for the deal?<eos> Did I make a mistake with you?
You're seeming... shy tonight.<eos> We can't escape our nature.<eos> Enough with the Myers-Briggs, Mafee.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers. The man here yet?<eos> - Nah, I haven't seen him.<eos> - Cheers. What? Weird.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Fuck. Thayer stonewalled us?<eos> I'm not gonna shield you from this, Bryan, all right?
Steph Reed says that Axe bought some enemy's books?<eos> He cornered the first edition book market for those specific books to spite a rival.<eos> And did she say... which books?<eos> Second World War by Churchill.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> This is what they do.<eos> How the fuck do you compete with something that powerful, that swims around for days on end, just waiting for the faintest smell of blood so it can attack without warning, and with all the ferocity and half the conscience of a goddamn bull shark?<eos> You can't.<eos> Unless you can somehow anticipate where it will strike and then match its strength when it does... which you can't.<eos> I can see books are a trigger for you...
Cars are meant to go.<eos> Happy birthday, Axe, wherever you are.<eos> Way to go, Wags! Axe didn't show up?<eos> Who does that, skips his own party?<eos> That's fucking fantastic.<eos> Maybe he's an introvert, too.<eos> No, he's not an introvert.<eos> He just remembered he's an outlaw.<eos> A fucking desperado.<eos> Hey. Axe said to give this to you.
- What?<eos> - Take them off.<eos> Now.<eos> Tell your people it's time for justice.<eos> The land you've lived on needs to be returned.<eos> Abandon the ranch.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Too much has been sacrificed...<eos> I know what's been sacrificed, boy.<eos> That's why you'll leave. Or I'll feed every goddamn one of you to the crows.
Come in.<eos> Sorry, Madison, sorry.<eos> I was just looking for Alicia.<eos> She's out and about, Gretchen.<eos> Probably with Jake. I'll...<eos> I'll just...<eos> Is Mike okay?<eos> Freaked.<eos> He said you saved him, though.<eos> He said everybody would have died without you.
Can't be absolutely sure.<eos> I don't think of him as a man.<eos> My boys, they go away a couple days, they come to mind. It's like they're seven, eight years old again.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> We have to go back.<eos> Now.<eos> Troy!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They were good people. They didn't deserve this end.<eos> Our family, we... we weren't prepared like you.
You were just making sure those bodies stayed buried, huh?<eos> They better stay buried.<eos> You're a guest here, son.<eos> Get right with the past or get off my land.<eos> It's their land.<eos> The land belongs to whoever can hold it.<eos> The Indians couldn't, gave it up for beer money.<eos> I held it, I hold it, so it's mine.<eos> Well, the Indians are coming.<eos> And Walker is coming for you.
If I wasn't busy keeping everyone else alive, I would have time for feelings.<eos> I'd love that luxury. I'd love to indulge myself. But someone has to be strong.<eos> Someone has to keep everyone else together.<eos> You have no idea what I carry.<eos> Hello, this is Cosmonaut Valery Stepanovich Vashchenko - of the spacecraft Soyuz.<eos> - Holy sh... holy shit. Hello?<eos> Are you there? Do you read?<eos> Hello?<eos> This is Victor Strand in Baja, California.<eos> I read you loud and clear.
Hello?<eos> This is Victor Strand in Baja, California.<eos> I read you loud and clear.<eos> Uh, do you know what's happened in North America, Mr. Vashchenko?<eos> North America?<eos> You sound like an American, my friend, thinking everything happens only to him.<eos> So, it's not just here?<eos> I saw the lights go out on the world three days before my scheduled reentry.<eos> A dramatic show.<eos> I speak to you from my grave.
The world turns.<eos> The world is dead.<eos> Nah, the world will not die until you die.<eos> Do not wait for your deathbed to enjoy your champagne, Victor.<eos> Have a glass for me.<eos> Your artifacts are unharmed.<eos> Why have you thrown in with this trash? Explain that to me.<eos> You can't always choose your people.<eos> We can end this, you and me.<eos> We return your artifacts to you, share what we have. In return, peace.
One morning, she ate her cereal. She brushed her teeth for school.<eos> She took the gun out of her daddy's dresser.<eos> She shot him.<eos> Shot him while he slept off the night before.<eos> My mama looked at me then like you're looking at me now.<eos> I knew that was something I'd have to carry.<eos> I'd do it again.<eos> I'd live with the look.<eos> I'd do it a thousand times to protect her.<eos> To protect you.
I'm going Alamo, Madison.<eos> Last line of defense.<eos> I built this house as a... A hold-out in case we ever were overrun or under siege.<eos> Could be both.<eos> I got supplies and weapons in the basement.<eos> Your family's welcome to hole up here<eos> - if it ever comes to it. - When it comes to it.<eos> Want a drink?<eos> Come on, drink with me.<eos> I wanna thank you for standing by my boys and by Troy, and for trying to stop what's coming.
Come on, drink with me.<eos> I wanna thank you for standing by my boys and by Troy, and for trying to stop what's coming.<eos> That's good.<eos> Told Jake I couldn't come to an agreement with Walker.<eos> That was a lie.<eos> There is one way to secure the peace.<eos> He probably wants my scalp, huh?<eos> What?<eos> You... you here to kill me, Madison?<eos> I took you in, you and your kids when you were in need.

Either way, I'm cutting a hole in someone.<eos> Okay you failed this quiz now twice.<eos> Especially the essay portion.<eos> I'm calling Bobby and canceling.<eos> Oh. They're home.<eos> He means, hey, girls.<eos> How did you get a key to our apartment?<eos> They specifically say on them,<eos> "Do not copy for Oleg."<eos> I find that when you go in a Home Depot pantless, they'll do anything to get you out quick.
No cell phones.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> Did I cover my bed in "Dexter" tarp for nothing?<eos> We're on a date.<eos> Trying like crazy not to have sex.<eos> Usually, when the lights go down in the movie, so do my pants.<eos> And then, so do I.<eos> And of course we would have to see a super sexy poster of Steve Buscemi in the lobby.<eos> Hi, I'm Bobby.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Hey, everybody!<eos> Oh, all right.<eos> Don't talk to Baby Barbara.<eos> We're in a fight.<eos> She thought that the Fifty Shades book was better than the movie.<eos> Sophie, have you ever heard that you're supposed to have sex on the third date?<eos> Oh, that's a nun thing, right?<eos> I am so glad I don't have to deal with this kind of stuff anymore.<eos> I am officially retired from sex.<eos> Not sure how many of you have heard the news, but not sure how many of you read "Juggs."
It's actually quite rich.<eos> I was just saying to Mossimo down at the boccie court...<eos> Thank you!<eos> I rest my case.<eos> And tomorrow I'm taking golf lessons thanks to our community board.<eos> Apparently, I don't meet the weight minimum for Krav Maga.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> Retired people love golf.<eos> Just like you lesbians.
There's no lube aisle.<eos> None of the mannequins are doing each other.<eos> This is a classy lingerie store, not Second-Hand Hose.<eos> I got kicked out of there.<eos> I ate a pair of edible underwear and I put the box back on the shelf.<eos> Ladies, I'm Rita.<eos> Welcome to the Art of Seduction, where seduction begins with...<eos> A shot of tequila and ends with a shot of penicillin?<eos> Not what I was going to say at all.<eos> What can I help you ladies with?
What can I help you ladies with?<eos> Uh, she has a third date situation happening.<eos> Do you have anything that says "Grand Reopening"?<eos> I want to be naughty.<eos> But I get cold.<eos> I found your shoelace section, but where is the underwear?<eos> That is underwear, and you're holding it backwards.<eos> Oh, sure, I see it now.<eos> Let's go to Target.<eos> And, uh, what about you?
Ooh, that's a gay first date.<eos> My first date was a Hall Oates concert.<eos> Yes, I'm old.<eos> Welcome, everyone!<eos> Let's get started.<eos> It's time to get sexy!<eos> Yep, according to my "Hustler" watch, it's 11:69.<eos> Can't be right.<eos> Feels earlier.<eos> I was screaming at you for three blocks to wait up.
We win that, we get to leave Detroit.<eos> Oh, cool, I still have to pick up my last check from Chrysler.<eos> He was my pimp.<eos> Uh, do the bowling wives have to go to that... get to come to that?<eos> Sure, that'd be great.<eos> This could be our thing.<eos> You could be my bowling wife.<eos> Before I say yes, is there any way the bar here serves white wine?<eos> Well, this is what couples do for each other, right?<eos> I'm sure your spouses support you in whatever's important to you.
We gotta get her out of there.<eos> All right. I'll keep her entertained and you guys sneak up behind her with the claw.<eos> Max, so you don't think it's broken, do you?<eos> I know you've always wanted a hook, but I don't wanna be the cause of it.<eos> Is there any way you can use your left?<eos> Out of the question. This one's just for show.<eos> In an emergency, someone else can bowl for Max, but since we're mid-game, it must be someone of the same gender.<eos> I was gonna see how this worked out before I dropped it on you.<eos> I'm also league commissioner.<eos> I'm sure one of you knows how to bowl.
Next.<eos> - For a better tomorrow.<eos> - Go your left.<eos> - One more, please.<eos> - Welcome to the Freedom Center<eos> Philadelphia. Please stay in line and have your ID badge ready.<eos> To be eligible, all blood donations must be up to date.<eos> Shit!<eos> The Partnership.<eos> We're here for you.
To be eligible, all blood donations must be up to date.<eos> Shit!<eos> The Partnership.<eos> We're here for you.<eos> No one will forget the terrors of Illumination Day.<eos> We mourned together.<eos> We made our peace.<eos> Now, nine months later, we are marching forward into a new era.<eos> Thanks to the cooperation that is at the heart of the Partnership, everyone's needs are being met, jobs are plentiful, shelter is guaranteed, and sustenance is provided.<eos> And at our Freedom Centers, teams of caring and committed medical professionals are ready and eager to serve you.
I don't think this is hell.<eos> I think it's hell-adjacent.<eos> Well, thank you for ruining my self-indulgent misery.<eos> I was gonna wallow in it for a while but, uh...<eos> Our children, our future.<eos> - Who's there?<eos> - It's the doctor.<eos> Neil sent me.<eos> Put the gun away or I'm leaving right now.<eos> What about you?
I'm Ross.<eos> This is my wife Karen.<eos> You're safe.<eos> And you are?<eos> Dr. Miller.<eos> You're supposed to have some liquor for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wedding present.<eos> We're not big drinkers.<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Dr. Miller.<eos> You're supposed to have some liquor for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wedding present.<eos> We're not big drinkers.<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> I only treat patients one-on-one.<eos> I'll be right here, hon.<eos> I'm petrified of going to a Freedom Center.<eos> I hear they just ship you off to some other facility?
You see it every day.<eos> I'm still gonna take a photo.<eos> In a world where superheroes and villains battle above us each day,<eos> Wayne Security brings you products that give the power back to the powerless.<eos> Like our revolutionary Joker anti-venom.<eos> - Emily Locke?<eos> - I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> You'll never believe what happened to me.<eos> My train literally went off the rails and the...<eos> I'm gonna cut you off here because I'm assuming you lived.

He's hard to reach.<eos> But... look at his reply.<eos> "Stop using my HBO GO password."<eos> No, that...<eos> What a joker.<eos> That's classic B-Dubs.<eos> Look at the one right before it.<eos> "Sounds good."<eos> Bruce Wayne thinks you "sounds good."<eos> Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

I'm dying to hear the end of that story, but...<eos> Ooh, look, it's... my assistant's, uh, motioning to me.<eos> What is it?<eos> Jackie, did you need something?<eos> - No.<eos> - What do you want from me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You are the worst.<eos> Uh, you said there's a phone call for me?<eos> Bruce Wayne is on the phone for you.
But then Bob Lackey from WayneBev pulled the idea for Wayne Light Lime out of his ass and he took my spot!<eos> The only reason you're here is to come up with a big idea to get me out of this God-forsaken taint of a city.<eos> And I will.<eos> It just might take a little time.<eos> I'm sure Wayne Light Lime didn't happen overnight.<eos> The man left a lime in a beer, literally overnight.<eos> Get me to Gotham, or somebody else will.<eos> If he thinks I'm scared, I'm not.<eos> I'm going to get the team to come up with a big idea.<eos> Yeah, they seem to love you.
A boss can't be afraid to look human.<eos> That line was starred.<eos> Is a star more or less than a circle?<eos> Stop going through my book.<eos> A star is greater that a circle, but less than a heart.<eos> Wayne Security?<eos> Citizens of Charm City, this is Jack-O-Lantern with a personal message for Crimson Fox.<eos> You can run...<eos> Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.<eos> Bruce Wayne is on the phone for you.
It's really Bruce.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How do I look?<eos> Like you don't understand how phones work.<eos> You keeping Gotham warm for me?<eos> Yes!<eos> I can hold.<eos> Hey, guys, wait up.<eos> What's that sound?<eos> It's a device I built that warns you when someone you don't like is approaching.
You haven't heard my idea yet.<eos> So, you know how everyone wants to have sex with robots, right?<eos> - Go on.<eos> - I'm listening.<eos> "Problems are just opportunities dressed in work clothes."<eos> You're aware this means nothing, right?<eos> I give up.<eos> I took this job to make a difference, and I didn't even get a chance.<eos> Oh, honey, no one makes a difference.<eos> I used to be just like you. I think we're pretty different.
Tell them the other news.<eos> I got a parking ticket.<eos> We're not fired.<eos> Wayne Security is staying open.<eos> Yeah, Bruce loved the Jack-O-Lert.<eos> He's putting it in beta, wherever that is.<eos> So great. Did he mention the color?<eos> - No.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> But he did say because I did such a good job inspiring all of you, he wants me to stay here to continue inspiring you.
So great. Did he mention the color?<eos> - No.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> But he did say because I did such a good job inspiring all of you, he wants me to stay here to continue inspiring you.<eos> I guess with great power comes living in a taint.<eos> I blame you.<eos> I blame you.<eos> You guys did it.<eos> You should be really proud of yourselves.<eos> We couldn't have done it without you.
Hi.<eos> You're having a party?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> What?<eos> Just a few friends... Came over... to hang out. Come on in.<eos> No, wait.<eos> No. Come on in.<eos> Come on.<eos> Gideon, in the real world, when someone calls and says they need to talk to you, and you tell them to come over, you have to mention the fact that you have, like...
All we can say for sure, is he was seen driving a car away from the area.<eos> You ran from the police.<eos> How are you gonna explain that?<eos> They were screaming at me.<eos> You know, you hear those horrible stories about the cops.<eos> I was afraid for my life.<eos> That's your story.<eos> No. That's the truth, detective.<eos> What can we do here?<eos> I wish I had a better answer for you.
That's your story.<eos> No. That's the truth, detective.<eos> What can we do here?<eos> I wish I had a better answer for you.<eos> Bottom line, if we want anything, we're gonna have to get it from him, and he's not talking.<eos> Well, then let's find a way to make him sing like Adele.<eos> Streisand.<eos> No, Adele.<eos> Let's go with Adele.<eos> Hey. I was watching you in there with Kilton.

I was watching you in there with Kilton.<eos> Watching me fail? Thanks.<eos> I promise, if I have to tase his ass...<eos> All right, well, before you do that, maybe I can help you.
I'm on a very tight schedule.<eos> What the hell? !<eos> Woman, how many times I gotta tell you?<eos> I did what you asked already!<eos> Why are you always yelling at me? !<eos> Well, if you did what I said the first time, we wouldn't be having this conversation!<eos> I did what you said the first time!<eos> Maybe you need to get your ears checked!<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah, I'm with the Chicago P.D. I actually wanted to talk to you about... Who's that?
Didn't I tell you to get your ass home two hours ago?<eos> Don't yell at him.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> It's the same damn story that I told you before.<eos> Well, I want you to tell me again.<eos> How does this work, exactly?<eos> I call it "upgraded interrogation."<eos> Sensors in my secret special fancy chair monitor his stress levels.<eos> So if she hits a nerve, if she asks him something that's got him worried, we'll know.<eos> And she can hear you with that earpiece?
All right, send me the info.<eos> 1305, squad, we are in back of the yards, as instructed.<eos> You want to tell us what we're doing here?<eos> We are interrogating James Kilton.<eos> He doesn't want us poking around his old neighborhood, so that's what you're doing.<eos> You'll be on live video, so, you know, keep your clothes on.<eos> Mr. Reeves, the video wall is up and running.<eos> Murphy, all right.<eos> We're live.<eos> Feeding video to you now.
What, that?<eos> I just thought you wanted to see how the investigation was going.<eos> Got a source that says you've been spending some time there.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Who's your source?<eos> Nice, Murph.<eos> His heart rate just went through the roof.<eos> I can't kiss and tell, now, can I?<eos> Let's just say the source is real close to you.<eos> Hey, I told you...
Coming back around.<eos> To hell with this.<eos> Hey, sit down.<eos> Whoa, what's it... No, Murph.<eos> Got to get him back in the chair.<eos> I don't really feel like sitting right now.<eos> I don't feel like doing any of this.<eos> No? Do you feel like spending the night in lockup?<eos> 'Cause if you don't sit your ass down right now,<eos> I'm gonna throw you in a cell, you're gonna have to wait until you see a judge and pony up bail.
What do you want us to do when we get there?<eos> Just find a security guard and talk about the weather.<eos> We just need the video to convince James we're getting close.<eos> 1305, squad, arriving at parking lot now.<eos> Damn, looks like Brandt's onto something.<eos> James sure thinks so.<eos> He is nervous about that lot, Murph.<eos> James... if you talk to us, if you help us, we can cut you a deal.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> If we crack this case without you, the deal's off the table.
Recognize that car lot?<eos> You do, don't you?<eos> We link you to the car, we link you to the robbery, then you go down for murder.<eos> I don't need no deal, detective.<eos> Look at that screen.<eos> Do you think those cops are talking to that guard for no reason?<eos> Fine, if that's the way you want it, good luck in trial.<eos> Wait!<eos> All right! All right.<eos> I'll tell you what you want to know... But I want a deal, you got me?
Look, you guys, you picked me up before I got the whole plan.<eos> Look, all I know is that we were setting up at an apartment on Kendall street.<eos> What's the address?<eos> What do you need that for?<eos> You already got that guy talking.<eos> You-you got, you got those cops.<eos> Wait. No, no, no, no, come on.<eos> Son of a bitch. You lied to me.<eos> You didn't have nobody, did you?<eos> Nope... But we've got you now.
Wait. No, no, no, no, come on.<eos> Son of a bitch. You lied to me.<eos> You didn't have nobody, did you?<eos> Nope... But we've got you now.<eos> You're in, James.<eos> You and your loser friends are done.<eos> You know, you think you're so much better than us?<eos> We were making ten bucks an hour, no benefits, carrying around millions of dollars for rich fat cats like your boss.<eos> All we were doing was evening the score.<eos> Linc Richards was one of you, you pathetic son of a bitch!

Bomb must've gone off by accident.<eos> That bomber is toast.<eos> Thought you were at the hospital.<eos> I was.<eos> My ears are still ringing pretty good, but they can't do much for that there.<eos> They figure out what happened with the bomb?<eos> Why it went off?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> They're working the forensics, but the leading theory now is...<eos> Stuff happens. Speaking of which, um... I wanted to talk to you about that transfer that your ex-husband gave you.
We're doing things better.<eos> We're making the city safer.<eos> Safer..<eos> What about the giant explosion in the middle of the city last week?<eos> Was that safer?<eos> That's a matter of perspective.<eos> Look, we both know that this is as much about the fact that your ex-wife works here than it is about anything that I'm doing.<eos> My marriage has nothing to do with this.<eos> This is about your blatant disregard for the law.<eos> And, Mr. Reeves, I'll see you at the mayor's office on Thursday.
And, Mr. Reeves, I'll see you at the mayor's office on Thursday.<eos> We'll determine which of those cases will be dismissed.<eos> I suggest you come prepared.<eos> You've stepped in it now.<eos> I just...<eos> My... This is...<eos> They're seriously gonna let bad guys go for the sake of politics?<eos> You embarrassed the mayor when you took over the district.<eos> He wants payback.<eos> I've been around a long time, and I'm telling you there's only one way out of a situation like this.
I already am. Got a case that came in last night.<eos> - A weird one.<eos> - Yeah. Some nutjob shot up an ATM last night about 8:00.<eos> Alarm goes off, we respond.<eos> He's just standing there, waiting, gun on the ground, hands up.<eos> All right, don't take this the wrong way.<eos> Sounds like a case where you don't need my help.<eos> - I think he did it.<eos> - Yeah, we got that.<eos> The thing is, he says he was trying to get our attention, 'cause he needs to talk to you.
And then I saw what you did for your friend, and how you found his killer.<eos> I went to MIT, too.<eos> Class of '90.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I just, um...<eos> Wanted to do the same thing.<eos> I'm not quite the engineer you are, certainly not a billionaire.<eos> All I got for my trouble was a-a beating from some street dealers.<eos> Look, I know I'm gonna go to prison for what I did yesterday.<eos> I'm okay with that, but I, um... I'm asking you, please, just-just go to my home.
Rookie, you write this many moving violations, I'll give you a police medal myself.<eos> Don't. Don't encourage him, Bernie.<eos> Come on.<eos> What was that?<eos> What was what? I was getting us ticket books.<eos> You take four, they expect you to fill four.<eos> Cobb!<eos> Yeah. What beat are you guys working today?<eos> We're on a traffic car.<eos> I have a special assignment for you.
So I programmed a way to cross-check records and find people who've been changing aliases to stay out of federal databases.<eos> Okay. Well, which means what?<eos> Probable fugitives.<eos> We got a hit in the district, a Reggie Walker on 51st and Damen.<eos> According to our records, he's only existed for the past seven years.<eos> I'm gonna send his info to your squad car now.<eos> He dangerous?<eos> Yeah, there a chance this guy eats people or what?<eos> He's not hiding from the FBI because he's an angel.<eos> Look, I'm gonna level with you.
You know, it's a tough job.<eos> So, I also want to talk about you.<eos> Um, Cook County Savings is very upset about their ATM.<eos> What I did was wrong.<eos> I just... I didn't know what else to do.<eos> Well, it helps that you didn't steal any money.<eos> Also helps that I have a, very large account there, so... they're not going to be pressing any charges.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes. If you pay a fine and take an anger management class, where I guess they... teach you not to shoot at ATMs.<eos> All right, the desk officer will let you out shortly.
I mean, he was in Texas, he hit some hospital, took, like, 400 grand worth of meds.<eos> People were dying.<eos> They were just gonna throw<eos> - those drugs away...<eos> - That's enough.<eos> Anyway, the guy's been working at this clinic for, like, ten years.<eos> He's changing bedpans and stuff, no problems.<eos> I-I guess we can bring the guy in.<eos> It's just...<eos> Captain tell you to bring him in?
Just-just... just have to change a few settings.<eos> Okay, make it happen.<eos> You been on my ass for weeks!<eos> My daughter.<eos> You hurt my daughter.<eos> You blame me for that?<eos> Then you come down here with this gun, you try to take me out?<eos> You ever even seen a gun, old man?<eos> Here.<eos> Let me show you.
We can't let that son of a bitch walk.<eos> Murphy, is there any way that you can, you can get in there and back Brandt up?<eos> Just let him go, Marcos.<eos> Not unless I'm shooting through the wall.<eos> What if you did shoot through the wall?<eos> - I'm done with this.<eos> - Gideon, are you crazy?<eos> I can shoot anyone.<eos> Well, what if I can help? What...<eos> What if I can show you what Brandt is seeing?
Yeah, you want to talk about this now?<eos> Or after I paint the walls with his brains?<eos> See that pipe he's standing under?<eos> I see it.<eos> I'm not messing around.<eos> Get back!<eos> Gideon, I can't do this.<eos> I'll be shooting blind.<eos> Just trust the tech.<eos> Nobody's messing with you.
I see it.<eos> I'm not messing around.<eos> Get back!<eos> Gideon, I can't do this.<eos> I'll be shooting blind.<eos> Just trust the tech.<eos> Nobody's messing with you.<eos> Just lower the gun.<eos> I'm done with this.<eos> I want you and the rest of the cops out of here now.
Yeah, well, things may have changed a little there.<eos> Gideon is down at the mayor's office with Murphy right now.<eos> Morning.<eos> Before we begin, I was told that you have something urgent to tell me.<eos> I do, I do, I do...<eos> This is kind of awkward now.<eos> - What is?<eos> - Well, I...<eos> I should have asked about this before.<eos> I did it again, I asked some reporters to come and do a press conference after we're done, so I just wanted to talk to you about that.
The scratching post.<eos> Let's get up and running.<eos> We don't have any customers yet.<eos> Make some then.<eos> I've developed a serum that could potentially undo the memory loss that accompanies the second zombie cure.<eos> The serum is completely ineffective.<eos> It won't be long before you have an episode too severe for that inhaler to help.<eos> This is the real deal!<eos> With real bullets!<eos> So, let's make sure they do not leave you real dead!
He shouldn't be leaving town.<eos> He could die any day.<eos> Well, he's got one of our cure syringes.<eos> If he gets too bad, he can inject himself.<eos> New case.<eos> I need to get your thoughts.<eos> Don't know how this works yet?<eos> As a general rule, I require a dead body and a brain.<eos> She's right.<eos> We tend to meet you at what's called a "crime scene," and then...
Blaine's human, I'm not.<eos> But that's not my problem.<eos> It's the color, right?<eos> Blue isn't appetizing.<eos> She was a dominatrix, Ravi.<eos> A dominatrix who went by the name sweet lady pain.<eos> Oh, that? You're already a bit on the bossy side, I doubt anyone would even notice.<eos> Remember where we found her?<eos> In her dungeon, surrounded by freaky sex toys and strangled by her own whip.<eos> Does that sound fun to you?
We needs visions, Liv.<eos> I'll get the frying pan.<eos> Crawl over here, Piggie, and bring me my gloves.<eos> Someone's asking to be punished.<eos> Is it you?<eos> Here.<eos> I thought so.<eos> This is where you end up when your parents don't tell you they love you.<eos> Don't be so close-minded.<eos> A control freak like you could enjoy being told what to do for a change.
Down on all fours.<eos> - Lick it up.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Why don't we talk in private.<eos> Yeah. Let's.<eos> What about my boot?<eos> Sorry to interrupt your campaigning, but we're looking into the murder of Roxanne Greer.<eos> - Who? - You knew her as sweet lady pain.<eos> I don't think I'm familiar with...<eos> I ate her brain and had a vision of you wearing a gimp mask.
- We should get rid of him.<eos> - That's it?<eos> No trial?<eos> No jury?<eos> Just an execution.<eos> Do we wait until he puts a bullet in another little zombie boy's head?<eos> Let's not all forget that I work with the police.<eos> No one's getting rid of anyone.<eos> What we need is information.<eos> Now, he won't talk to the police, but I bet he'll talk to you.
There's a stool in the back.<eos> Dick.<eos> You say something?<eos> No, you're hearing things, big fella.<eos> Tell your grandma I'mma swing by to roll her a few spliffs.<eos> Rheumatoid arthritis ain't gonna stop no sweet lady from getting her swerve on.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> How much will a U-boat set me back?<eos> Twenty will get you a ticket to ride, my friend.<eos> - Can I hook you up?
If this is being a zombie, then bring it on!<eos> This is torture and I'm not even enjoying it.<eos> Tell me again how we know the peeping tom had a criminal record?<eos> We don't.<eos> We're taking an uneducated guess.<eos> It's what you do when you hit a dead end.<eos> We've got company.<eos> You needing me to get you a teleprompter, Johnny?<eos> I was told not to speak until my lawyer is present.<eos> Oh, lord. I told you to meet me in the waiting area.
Only an idiot would trust a blackmailer to destroy the footage.<eos> Say it out loud.<eos> "I'm an idiot."<eos> Detective, can you tell your partner to stop verbally abusing my client?<eos> Tell your client to stop asking for it.<eos> I have an important bomb to drop if you're done with your shenanigans.<eos> Good. Yesterday, Mr. frost received another request for money in exchange for not releasing the video.<eos> You picking up what I'm putting down, detective?<eos> Where do we arrange the drop?<eos> - Vivian? - I'm sorry, general, I'll have to call you back.
We believe our men may have been exposed to the virus.<eos> Are you familiar with the Tuttle-Reid murders?<eos> I've heard stories on the radio.<eos> Caleb Tuttle worked for us.<eos> The police said they found tubes like these in his refrigerator.<eos> Tubes full of a brain paste.<eos> We suspect he was infected that same night, and he swiped the tubes from the Max rager basement.<eos> What happened to the rest of your men who went down there?<eos> We've quarantined them.<eos> So far, none of them are craving brains, but we're worried about them, which is why we brought you in.

We're the ones who understand that if you're not willing to do what it takes, you're gonna end up a zombie or a zombie snack.<eos> Either way, you won't be spared.<eos> We appreciate your time, Mr. Johns.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> I'm a bit more inclined to believe something medical.<eos> A virus. "Zombies" is a bit of a leap.<eos> What do you call that?<eos> Are you sure your brother didn't just send you a picture from a zombie movie?<eos> Bury your head in the sand if you want to.<eos> It's a shame. Military contractor like you could be awful handy.
Also did a stint in a psych ward.<eos> We can nail him for extortion, but as far as Roxanne's murder?<eos> Our case is thin.<eos> Let me work him over, see what I can do.<eos> You wanna be bad cop?<eos> That requires genuine intimidation, Liv.<eos> I'm sorry. You're many things, but intimidating?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Watch me.<eos> Anything I can get for you?
How many protestors are out there today?<eos> More than yesterday.<eos> But they're doing their best to divert them away from the White House.<eos> I don't know what's worse... the sound of their chanting or the sound of silence when they're not.<eos> I'll get to work, sir.<eos> Good morning, Augustus.<eos> Well, Eric, I...<eos> I'm sorry. They told me to sit, but, uh...<eos> Oh, no, no, no. It's perfectly fine.<eos> I... I can't imagine anyone else who would... well, enjoy this more than you.
What?<eos> He was dead.<eos> Cold. They put him on a cart... bunch of dead bodies to bury.<eos> Then, after a full day and night... he woke up.<eos> What?<eos> Someone stole his shoes and the buttons off his uniform, but... he lived.<eos> Few days later, he caught up to his regiment.<eos> Really?<eos> I have to get back to the madness.<eos> I hope I get to see you again, Mr. President.
That's it.<eos> - Please don't insult me.<eos> - Who do you think you are?<eos> Inserting yourself into every aspect of our lives.<eos> Your husband's campaign needed help.<eos> - Help arrived.<eos> - Yes, but...<eos> Help that you, most of all, pushed for.<eos> Yes?<eos> - Who told you about the VR therapy?
I want you to find out what happened to my...<eos> Whatever, forget it. - Uh.<eos> Hold on.<eos> - Thanks for the sandwich.<eos> All right. Hold on.<eos> There's a story that I love about LBJ.<eos> Uh, it was back in '64 or '65.<eos> A congressman was ducking him...<eos> and he came back to his office to find the president sitting in his chair... waiting for him.<eos> The president expects to see you within the hour.
Oh, I just needed to drop this for him.<eos> Sure. Next time, just ask.<eos> See you tonight.<eos> You gambled and you lost.<eos> Actually, my bloc gained seats more than eight weeks ago.<eos> - Which I suspect is why I'm here.<eos> - Don't overestimate your position.<eos> Or underestimate mine.<eos> You still haven't been elected president, sir.<eos> Yeah, but the presidency won't matter once the party turns its back on you, will it?

You are awfully confident for someone who's already lost the election once.<eos> Do me a favor. Forget the presidency for just a moment.<eos> You don't have... the capital... to build on the congressional revolution that you've started, politically or otherwise.<eos> Our movement wants to explode things...<eos> Oh, please. Spare me your progressive PR bullshit.<eos> You want what they all want.<eos> Access.<eos> A better seat at the table.<eos> Your name before the rest.<eos> And that is something that I can give you.
Access.<eos> A better seat at the table.<eos> Your name before the rest.<eos> And that is something that I can give you.<eos> And how many votes do you want in exchange?<eos> Just three from your ever-growing bloc would assure me the win in key delegations.<eos> Specifically?<eos> Maine, Wisconsin and New Hampshire are still in play.<eos> All three?<eos> I believe in you, Congressman.
Anything from the National Police?<eos> No.<eos> CIA's man in the palace isn't even sure he's still in Jakarta.<eos> They'll find him, LeAnn.<eos> That's all I can give you.<eos> I appreciate your help.<eos> Kerry, Susan, what can I get you?<eos> - I'm fine, thanks.<eos> - I'm good with water.<eos> - What about you, Louise?
Susan and I were talking on the way over, Claire.<eos> This election mess has left us all facing some scary possibilities.<eos> - Conway wins in the House...<eos> - Which is far from inevitable.<eos> But if a split ticket were to happen... it would be bad for this country.<eos> No, Conway is what would be bad for this country.<eos> Let's hope the House does the right thing.<eos> But as far as the Senate, I am very grateful that we have Donald Blythe steering that ship.<eos> Mrs. Underwood, I'm sorry to say this, but no matter what you're offering here,<eos> I can't support the president. And, by extension, I can't support you.
I can't support the president. And, by extension, I can't support you.<eos> It's not you, Claire. It's him.<eos> Susan and I are on the same page about this.<eos> What if this isn't about Francis Underwood, huh?<eos> It's Claire Underwood who has the promising future.<eos> I want a woman in the White House.<eos> And if she has to start as a vice president, fine.<eos> But it's time.<eos> It's time.<eos> I hear that, Louise, but I'll say it... a vote for you is a vote for Frank Underwood.

Congressman Romero, do you have good news for me?<eos> Have your progressives seen the light?<eos> I did what I could, Mr. President.<eos> I couldn't sway the bloc.<eos> Couldn't... or wouldn't?<eos> Maine and New Hampshire are noncommittal.<eos> Congressman Wolcott is turning Wisconsin for Conway.<eos> Tell me a different truth.<eos> They aren't listening to me.<eos> They believe supporting you would do more damage to the Democratic Party and the country than a Conway presidency.
It doesn't make sense.<eos> I thought I had him.<eos> And it's not just New Hampshire. Wisconsin should've folded.<eos> Should have?<eos> What's going on, Doug?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Is there some issue with your commitment?<eos> What?<eos> Perhaps you just aren't worthy of my trust.<eos> I have given everything to you.
It's not just what he did with all the data.<eos> Aidan had access to everything.<eos> We need to get the CIA and FBI off his trail,<eos> - and I need your help.<eos> - You're causing problems, LeAnn, which is the last thing that we can afford right now.<eos> - Macallan sealed his own fate.<eos> - I delivered Maine, Doug, which is more than you can say about New Hampshire.<eos> I'll owe you.<eos> Not enough.<eos> Has the president spoken to you about Aidan at all?
Do what you were supposed to do.<eos> Move the anti-filibuster measure forward so the Senate can vote<eos> - and elect me vice president.<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> - All voices should be heard out of respect for the American people and the gravity of the vote before the Senate today, the first like this since 1825.<eos> The House is about to vote, Donald. What is going on?<eos> Let's get this done so you can go home.<eos> It looks like Conway is going to win.<eos> And no matter what people have told you, the Senate is voting for Brockhart.
Something like that.<eos> Scavenging tech for A.L.I.E.?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Too many questions.<eos> Ignore me.<eos> I'm just upset that our mission here has failed.<eos> Hopefully your mother will come up with another way.<eos> You're just like her.<eos> Willing to do anything to save your people.<eos> Skaikru's lucky to have you.
Peter needs help now, right now!<eos> He can't breathe!<eos> If you go into that storm, 3 people die instead of two.<eos> You're out of options.<eos> It's time to let go.<eos> You said you'd be here.<eos> Where the hell are you?<eos> What am I supposed to tell them?<eos> The truth.<eos> I can't get to you.
Uh, what does it mean when you don't have pupils?<eos> You guys are so cute.<eos> Oh, I know you haven't seen the movie, so I'll give you a quick rundown of what happens for press questions.<eos> Uh, let's see.<eos> You lose your money.<eos> Sad, sad, sad.<eos> And then you meet this one.<eos> Sad, sad, sad.<eos> - You are so cute. - Oh.<eos> It's not as much about the two of you anymore.
- Hey.<eos> You look great.<eos> Oh, sorry, ooh.<eos> You two are like me and my eighth grade science teacher.<eos> Just can't keep your hands off each other.<eos> Max, you ruined Mr. Brillstein's life, and, like Mr. Brillstein, Andy is married.<eos> Oh, uh, well, actually I'm divorced.<eos> There's your M. Night Shyamalan twist!<eos> But don't let him direct the rest of the movie.<eos> Oh, how about a picture of you two for the photographers?
Ha, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> I have a question for Tess.<eos> In G'day Kate, you married a kangaroo for a green card?<eos> So this is super weird, right?<eos> Looking at them, being us.<eos> Andy, I can't talk now.<eos> I have to promote my dessert bar and answer all these questions.<eos> You know how reporters get when they have a fascinating subject.<eos> Caroline, no one's asked you anything and they already told you to stop raising your hand.<eos> Max, the actress playing you isn't here.
♪ I'll be in my booth ♪<eos> ♪ I'll be in my booth ♪<eos> ♪ I'll be in my booth ♪ You just don't get it.<eos> Can I mix alcohol and, like, five red pills?<eos> Ha, would I be standing here if you couldn't?<eos> Uh, this might seem weird or maybe just freaky enough, but I am very attracted to that part of her that is me.<eos> You know what, Earl?<eos> You play your cards right, you might be screwing yourself tonight.<eos> What's up, girl?<eos> Did I tell you that I got super rich?
Give us that and the sword is yours.<eos> Shortcut?<eos> Your smuggling tunnels.<eos> I'm just a simple metal trader trying to make a living in this cesspool.<eos> And all we want is a way in.<eos> You've come to the right man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sir, what is it?<eos> Let's keep moving, sir.<eos> I know I should have listened to you and stayed away from the conclave.
If you wanted to invite me for tea, all you had to do was ask.<eos> Quinn attacked the conclave.<eos> He resurfaced and all but declared war on the other Barons.<eos> Quinn is dead.<eos> He's very much alive.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> There's something you need to see.<eos> Quinn did it.<eos> Cut him down.<eos> I know things were difficult between you both...
I can't accept that.<eos> I insist.<eos> Now, some may say the world will end in fire.<eos> Some say ice.<eos> From what I've tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire.<eos> Visionary words, written by a wise man centuries ago.<eos> Fire is pure and true, unlike certain humans who amass power only to grow corrupt and weak.<eos> The Badlands are now led by people such as this!<eos> I know because I was one.<eos> But I give thanks to the fire that consumed my false empire, and brought me underground here with you.
That's always been the case with any species.<eos> If you wish to free your own Cogs, that is your business.<eos> But your so-called Sanctuary is becoming a haven for fugitives.<eos> And that's a threat I cannot tolerate.<eos> And once again, we're at an impasse.<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> Our world is at a tipping point.<eos> A war is the last thing it can endure.<eos> And if you lose the vote, a war will surely follow.<eos> It is for that reason and that reason alone I'm willing to throw my full support behind you...
It's a promise.<eos> Well, then, why wait?<eos> Perhaps cooler heads might prevail here?<eos> We can still come to a peaceful resolution.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> This just got a hell of a lot more interesting.<eos> Heading into a conclave, it's a dicey proposition.<eos> I'd like to commend Baron Broadmore for moving his family into a cottage two and a half miles south of his compound.<eos> He's right to fear that someone might try to harm them.<eos> Each of you have taken precautions to protect what is yours.
And the next thing I know is, is, um, she cuts her arm and her eyes go black.<eos> And it is an absolute bloodbath.<eos> No one survived.<eos> Not even the people she was trying to help.<eos> I think you can guess what happened when we got back to the Monastery.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Maryanne?<eos> The water is getting cold.<eos> Put those things down at once!<eos> I'm done taking orders from you, Baroness.
They understand what it takes to let the human spirit thrive.<eos> And all they ask for in return is something we can all very easily part with.<eos> Morning, Eddie.<eos> How's it going?<eos> It's going.<eos> Have a good one, Raul.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Sanjay Desai, Chief Health Care Officer for The Partnership.<eos> Now, these donations you're making, they're vital.<eos> Vital to the society we are building all around you.
Look, Bob, don't patronize me.<eos> I know this place is a dump.<eos> Not as clean as what's-his-name would keep it.<eos> - Hey. Good luck.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Take this chart down to ultrasound for me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, this is Nurse Greenwood.<eos> I'd like an update on that file<eos> - that I gave you yesterday.
What have you got for me today?<eos> - Are they fresh?<eos> - Don't insult me, Elizalde.<eos> - All right.<eos> - It seems your... operation has expanded.<eos> Yeah, I got a new partner now.<eos> You remember Creem.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> It's the old man that bought the magic book.<eos> Looks like that didn't work out too well for you, huh?
It was either this or our gangs were gonna kill each other.<eos> At least I still have the book.<eos> It doesn't seem you can say the same - for your $323 million.<eos> - Yeah, well, nuclear war wasn't good for the economy.<eos> - No one wanted my gold certificates.<eos> - Or your paintings or all your other material trappings.<eos> - What about your book?<eos> - The Lumen continues to be of vital importance.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> Hey, I believe you, Professor.

I realize now that... everything gained can just as easily be lost.<eos> The book is safe, Professor.<eos> We'll go back there and get it, as soon as we get out of this.<eos> I'm not talking about the book, Ms. Velders, but about humanity.<eos> For every stride, every turn toward goodness people make,<eos> we want to believe that the progress is lasting.<eos> Irreversible.<eos> We wanted to believe this so badly that we let down our guard.<eos> And our own evil crept back into us.<eos> Hi, this is Sanjay Desai, Chief Health Care Officer for The Partnership, offering you
Pretend like everything's normal?<eos> Trust the powers that be to act in our best interest?<eos> That's how we got to where we are right now.<eos> Too many people sitting back just hoping for the best.<eos> That I agree with.<eos> Your cousin pussied out.<eos> We came all the way out here for nothing.<eos> Gus!<eos> Gus! Hey.<eos> I told you we could trust him.
Have a seat, Miranda.<eos> I can see you're very frustrated here.<eos> Why would anyone be frustrated?<eos> Right.<eos> I get it.<eos> You're an intelligent woman, you have skills, and you find it a bit of an insult that you're being asked to be a... baby vessel, right?<eos> Believe it or not, I'm very familiar with the feeling of being undervalued.<eos> I'll always be grateful to people who saw my potential.<eos> Gave me the opportunity to excel.<eos> That's what I'm doing with you.

So you want me to be the mouthpiece for your bullshit?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You know, the "B-positive living facility"<eos> that all the infertile women disappear to?<eos> Now, that is a very spacious, very accommodating place.<eos> Barely a downgrade from the luxury of this place.<eos> Sure.<eos> What about the babies?<eos> What's going to happen to the first one when it's born?<eos> Let me assure you, those babies are of unbelievable value to the Partnership.
- I wasn't being followed.<eos> - Where's Wilkins?<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> - No, that's the crazy thing, they just drained him.<eos> It's weird, right?<eos> I didn't think they were doing that anymore.<eos> They only do that when there's a purpose.<eos> After they've turned him, they'll have access to all of his memories, every piece of information he had.<eos> He'll be a part of their collective consciousness.<eos> They drank him to get to the rest of you.
No! No! She set me up!<eos> She set me up!<eos> She was trying to escape!<eos> I didn't do anything!<eos> She blackmailed me!<eos> I didn't do anything!<eos> This is bullshit!<eos> - I didn't do anything!<eos> - You ladies better come with me.<eos> Mr. Desai is gonna have a few questions for you.
All right, bye.<eos> Good morning, Burns.<eos> Good morning, Mrs. Rodriguez.<eos> I'm glad everyone enjoyed the motorcycle picture.<eos> Yeah, we had a little caption contest.<eos> Mine was, "Born to be wild-ly embarrassed."<eos> Okay, that picture was supposed to be for my wife, but mistakes were made.<eos> Why are you taking pictures of yourself on a motorcycle?<eos> Besides to delight me.<eos> I'm not talking to you about it.
No.<eos> You've taken enough.<eos> Luna, it's ok.<eos> We'll sedate you.<eos> I said no.<eos> I won't allow my blood to kill any more innocent people.<eos> Luna, please.<eos> Your blood is the one thing that can save us.<eos> My blood is a curse.<eos> It will, however, keep you from following me into the rain.
- No.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Wait. Abby.<eos> - Mom, don't!<eos> - Abby, don't! - Abby!<eos> Don't worry. It'll all be over soon now.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You're ok.<eos> Come on.<eos> I told you, it has never been opened.
Eagle is gone. - Congress, the cabinet.<eos> - Oh, oh, my God.<eos> Sir, you are now the president.<eos> I received a highly classified DOD file detailing how to blow up the Capitol.<eos> I think there's a traitor in the White House.<eos> I had to put down everyone's name who had security clearance.<eos> Aaron's on this list.<eos> The Capitol blew up and everyone died except Congressman Peter MacLeish.<eos> He's in on it.<eos> How does vice president sound to you?
They're on their way.<eos> Clear the hall!<eos> Hallway clear!<eos> I've got a GSW between the left axilla and clavicle.<eos> Patient is alert and oriented.<eos> I got B.P. at 136/92, heart rate 114, normal sinus rhythm, SPO2 at 98%.<eos> 1... 2... 3.<eos> Type and cross six units, two large-bore I.V.s wide-open.<eos> And get portable X-ray in here.<eos> Mr. President, we're gonna roll you over for a moment if that's okay.
We need to talk.<eos> It looks like I'll have to go into surgery after all.<eos> I'll be under general anesthetic for at least three hours.<eos> What's the protocol for that?<eos> Well, sir, if you're unconscious, that means you'll be incapable to discharge your duties as president.<eos> So we'll have to invoke the 25th Amendment.<eos> Okay, how do we do that?<eos> We'll notify the Speaker of the House and the president pro tem of the Senate through a signed and written statement that you'll be temporarily vacating the office.<eos> And Peter MacLeish will be acting president.<eos> I'll set up a call with you and the V.P. immediately, sir. No.
- Thank you.<eos> Hookstraten? What's that all about?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> So, just a reminder:<eos> the 25th Amendment has been invoked several times in the past.<eos> Both Presidents Reagan and Bush 43 temporarily transferred power to their vice presidents, so this is not unprecedented.<eos> - Yes, Gary?<eos> - Do we know what the odds are for a major surgery like this? I mean, in terms of patient survival.<eos> So, I'm not prepared to answer that right now, but the medical team is gonna be briefing the press pool after the successful completion of President Kirkman's surgery.<eos> Until then, I'll just be updating you on as-needed basis.
Like I've been shot.<eos> Well, at least your sense of humor is still intact.<eos> Kimble, I'm gonna have to invoke the 25th Amendment, which means that Peter MacLeish will be president.<eos> For how long?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We haven't always agreed on everything, but I've always felt that your heart was in the right place.<eos> I need you to keep an eye on the vice president, make sure he's working in the country's best interests, not his own.<eos> You understand what I'm saying?<eos> I do, sir.<eos> I'm counting on you.
You understand what I'm saying?<eos> I do, sir.<eos> I'm counting on you.<eos> I won't let you down, Mr. President.<eos> Has she said anything since we spoke?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> I'd like to question her, if it's all right.<eos> You know, under any other circumstances, I'd have to say no.<eos> But nothing about this makes any sense.<eos> Maybe she'll talk to you. Thanks.
Good afternoon.<eos> My name is Mike Ritter, Secret Service.<eos> I'm assigned to the president's personal protection detail.<eos> Yesterday you were brought to the president's attention by Speaker Hookstraten.<eos> She said you claimed to have had information about Vice President MacLeish before he was confirmed.<eos> The president would like to know what that information was.<eos> Agent Wells, you need to answer my question.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because I don't know you.
When's he getting here?<eos> Afraid it's not gonna be that simple.<eos> The president's undergoing surgery right now.<eos> He had to invoke the 25th.<eos> The 25th?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Peter MacLeish is president?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hannah... tell me what evidence you have against Peter MacLeish.<eos> Speaker Hookstraten to see you, sir.

Hannah... tell me what evidence you have against Peter MacLeish.<eos> Speaker Hookstraten to see you, sir.<eos> What can I do for you, Kimble?<eos> You can tell me what the hell's going on in your mind.<eos> You know if you open those markets tomorrow, it'll be a disaster.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And in case you've forgotten, you're addressing the office of the acting president.<eos> You know, Peter, when you first arrived in Congress, I thought you were... well... ordinary.<eos> Another first-termer just happy to be there, a man whose achievements had far outstripped even his own imagination.<eos> But I realize now that I'd underestimated you;

There's nothing ordinary about you.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> I appreciate you saying that.<eos> Just know I'll be watching you.<eos> Others may be distracted by what's happening today, but not me.<eos> If I see anything out of step, I'll take my suspicions straight to the White House press corps.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> Absolutely... sir.<eos> Excuse me, sir. They found the shooter.<eos> They're waiting for you at Command Ops.
That's why we took Nassar alive.<eos> I disagree.<eos> Give the order.<eos> Shoot to kill.<eos> Prepare to execute.<eos> Prepare to execute. Copy that.<eos> Prepare to enter.<eos> Mr. Vice President, I'm advising against this course of action, - in the strongest of terms.<eos> - Noted.<eos> I have a duty, sir, to you and the president...
That's not the problem. We know where she is.<eos> I'm interested in what she knows about Peter MacLeish.<eos> Anyone can get an I.D. like that.<eos> Why the hell should I open the door for you?<eos> Because if you don't, I'll just kick it in.<eos> Yeah, well, convince me.<eos> Tell me why I should let you inside.<eos> Catalan.<eos> - What?<eos> - Wells gave me a message. She told me to ask you about Catalan.
- Wells gave me a message. She told me to ask you about Catalan.<eos> Convinced now?<eos> Many on Wall Street are speculating that tomorrow's markets will experience the steepest nosedive since the Flash Crash of 2010.<eos> Investors are turning to assets... that are seen as safer bets in times of uncertainty. For...<eos> Aaron Shore.<eos> What?<eos> I need to see the president's schedule for the next 72 hours to know what to cancel and what to surrogate.<eos> This is a list of all the Kirkmans' family and friends.<eos> Please call them so they're not hearing things from the TV.<eos> - I'm also going to need... - Emily... - I'm gonna need a word with you, please.
What are you talking about?<eos> I just got off the phone with the White House archives. They were asking me if I had authorized you to look at my personal phone logs from two years ago.<eos> All right, so, I'll ask again.<eos> What's going on, Emily?<eos> - It must have been a miscommunication. - Yeah, right.<eos> Like the other day when you told me you were working late because the president was having second thoughts on his choice for the HUD secretary, something the president knew nothing about? What, was that a miscommunication, too?<eos> Talk to me, Emily. What's going on?<eos> I'm not at liberty to discuss this. I'm sorry.<eos> What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means I can't talk about this with you.
All right, let's close him up.<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> It's quiet.<eos> Kirkman's still in surgery?<eos> There was a complication, but, uh... it looks like he'll pull through.<eos> So will we.<eos> How the hell can you be so sure of that?<eos> Because he's got nothing on us.<eos> Catalan is dead.<eos> The evidence connecting you and him doesn't exist anymore.
President Richmond's Chief of Staff?<eos> I thought he died in the bombing.<eos> I can personally verify that he survived the explosion.<eos> I saw him myself.<eos> In fact, he's hiding out in some...<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I'm sorry. Agent Wells, this is my wife, Alex.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Respectfully, sir, this information is only for you and your security team.
I saw him myself.<eos> In fact, he's hiding out in some...<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I'm sorry. Agent Wells, this is my wife, Alex.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Respectfully, sir, this information is only for you and your security team.<eos> - Agent Wells, I promise you...<eos> - No, no, it's okay, Tom.<eos> I assure you that wasn't necessary.
I'm saying it now. Mr. President, we're dealing with a conspiracy that's so deep, so dangerous that nobody's safe.<eos> And not only is sharing information with outside personnel a threat to national security. It also puts the people you confide in at risk.<eos> Sir, you need to tighten your circle.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> I want MacLeish in custody as soon as possible. Ordinarily, I'd say we consult with the Attorney General.<eos> But we don't have an Attorney General.<eos> I know someone we can trust.<eos> Can I reach out to him?<eos> Okay, good.<eos> I've got an office you could use. We can get you in and out through covert access and maintain your cover story you're still in police custody.
- When did you speak to him? - About an hour ago.<eos> No, he didn't say why you were looking into the phone calls I made 2 1/2 years ago.<eos> And, frankly, I didn't think it was the right time to ask.<eos> - Keep me posted, all right? - Am I missing something here?<eos> Why me?<eos> Because you're a former U.S. attorney.<eos> You're a man of absolute integrity. And right now, the president needs a legal advisor who's above reproach.<eos> What you're asking is just a little above my pay grade.<eos> Well, it's above all of our pay grades. What we're talking about is completely unprecedented.<eos> But the president needs counsel, and I might have already told him that we can count on you.
- and he can explain himself.<eos> - You can't. Tom, you yourself said just the other day we can't trust anyone.<eos> I watched Aaron fight tooth and nail to protect and secure my presidency.<eos> I know.<eos> I know. If Aaron is involved with the terrorist - if - and you confront him and you show him your hand, you're putting yourself at even more risk.<eos> It's not exactly like I can freeze him out until I get to the bottom of this.<eos> I need his help. But there has to be a way to keep him at arm's length without arousing suspicion.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> I mean, the resources involved and the planning... a conspiracy that reaches all the way to the vice president.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.
MacLeish has other partners.<eos> Right.<eos> I thought you said you didn't have a lead on her.<eos> I don't. But Jason Atwood might.<eos> Jason.<eos> Hannah. Leave us now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I had them turned off.<eos> No eyes, no ears, just you and me.<eos> It's good to see you.
I had them turned off.<eos> No eyes, no ears, just you and me.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> How...<eos> How are you? What happened to you?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> I'm okay. How are you?<eos> How's my family?<eos> How's Luke?<eos> - Nobody told you?
Jason?<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> I took it.<eos> You gave me the lead, remember?<eos> The Weddle case.<eos> I knew they had Luke.<eos> I also knew this is how they got you to confess to Nassar's murder.<eos> Jason, take your statement back.<eos> Tell me everything you know.<eos> Listen to me, if they know - that I'm cooperating with you...
- Jason...<eos> Please.<eos> We need your help.<eos> You want to help me... find my son.<eos> All I know is what the White House switchboard operator told me. That Aaron made the call to the Secretary of Defense right before the threat-assessment memo - was recalled by the Pentagon.<eos> - And he confronted you?<eos> Yes. He found out I was making inquiries.<eos> He was very upset.<eos> He asked what I was doing.<eos> I told him he needed to talk to you.
Clearly, he's still conducting business.<eos> Yes, but...<eos> So... I need to see him.<eos> Why don't you tell me what it's regarding? And I'll relay it to him.<eos> What this is regarding is strictly between me and the president.<eos> All right. Respectfully, Madam Speaker, I'm his Chief of Staff.<eos> It's my job to know what's going on.<eos> Perhaps, but not from me.<eos> He'll know what this is about.<eos> He can tell you if he wants, but I'm not gonna betray his confidence.
Thank you.<eos> Try hard.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I can help find Luke Atwood.<eos> - Let me liaise with state police...<eos> - Don't make this personal.<eos> It is personal. I promised Jason I would do everything I can.<eos> Yes, and the boy has been a state-wide priority since he was taken.<eos> You just saw me put three more agents on it myself.<eos> Now, each one of them is more qualified in missing persons than you.
She'll be taken care of.<eos> We'll get through this.<eos> We always do.<eos> I've never felt anger like this before.<eos> You know, I've never even hit someone in my entire life, not even in grade school.<eos> I was always the peacemaker.<eos> But when I saw him just standing there, smiling, I wanted to reach out and strangle him.<eos> Honestly, I think I could have killed him.<eos> You hid it well, sir.<eos> He thinks he's playing you, but in reality, he's a prisoner in plain sight, in full view of the American public, not to mention a phalanx of Secret Service agents.
He thinks he's playing you, but in reality, he's a prisoner in plain sight, in full view of the American public, not to mention a phalanx of Secret Service agents.<eos> We just got to be patient.<eos> He'll make a mistake, lower his guard.<eos> And when he does...<eos> He's mine.<eos> How are you feeling, Mr. President?<eos> Much better. Thank you.<eos> All right. Where would you like to start?<eos> Let me begin.<eos> I understand there's some tension between you and Emily.
And when he does...<eos> He's mine.<eos> How are you feeling, Mr. President?<eos> Much better. Thank you.<eos> All right. Where would you like to start?<eos> Let me begin.<eos> I understand there's some tension between you and Emily.<eos> She's been looking into my phone records.<eos> At my direction.<eos> I also asked her to keep you out of the loop.
Uh, how... how long have you been standing there?<eos> Long enough to hear how good you are.<eos> I didn't even know you played.<eos> I was serious about it for a while, but now I just play to release stress.<eos> And does it work?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> So, I just got back from the hospital.<eos> Listen, I-I get why you're being so cagey.<eos> It was a matter of national security.<eos> Aaron, he asked me to vet you.
You mean the president can't tell me.<eos> Right now, we're one and the same.<eos> Yeah, we're just coming back from Norfolk now.<eos> Oh, it was fine. Shook a lot of hands, broke a champagne bottle on a destroyer's bow.<eos> It was strictly routine.<eos> Yeah, I love you, too.<eos> Hey. I saw your chalk mark.<eos> What's up?<eos> It's Joyner.<eos> He wants to see you.
I'm sorry, Captain.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Improvise, adapt, overcome, right?<eos> Tell him I'll, uh...<eos> Yeah. I'll meet him at the, uh, same place as last time, tonight, 21:00.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Okay.<eos> I told the president you wanted to see him.<eos> And?<eos> And he said he'd get back to you when he can.
We'll never know now.<eos> But there was Vice President MacLeish this morning turning it into a victory lap.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You weren't in the room, ma'am.<eos> But you were, Aaron.<eos> What happened?<eos> Was MacLeish involved, yes or no?<eos> Even the President has his suspicions about MacLeish.<eos> He told me so himself.<eos> Or didn't he fill you in?
- On a routine follow-up.<eos> The guy just needs some reassurance.<eos> I can give it to him.<eos> Fine.<eos> Talk to him this once.<eos> But if it doesn't work, the problem has to be eliminated.<eos> No victory without sacrifice, remember?<eos> I remember.<eos> Atwood.<eos> I got nothing to say to you.
Atwood.<eos> I got nothing to say to you.<eos> Jason, it's about Luke.<eos> Jason. Wait.<eos> Sir!<eos> No! Let him go!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Car's ready, Mr. Vice President.<eos> Thanks, Rich.<eos> - It's just the two of you, right?
I thought I knew how this town worked, but it doesn't make sense anymore.<eos> You know, every... everyone I thought I could count on, everything, it doesn't matter.<eos> The system wins in the end, right?<eos> I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.<eos> Maybe I'm naive.<eos> Maybe I'm both.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Did I ever tell you about how I got my first job at the White House?<eos> Harvard Lampoon connection.<eos> I told you?
We're all really sad.<eos> There's nothing wrong with that.<eos> You need to go home, get home safely, get a really good night's sleep.<eos> That is all of my advice at this hour.<eos> You get more tomorrow.<eos> - Thank you. - No, no, no.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> Yes, ma'am, can I help you?
You shouldn't be calling me.<eos> The FBI agent who questioned Joyner, who was it?<eos> - I don't know. Joyner didn't say.<eos> - Well, was it a man or a woman?<eos> A woman, Asian woman, I think he said. Why?<eos> Come on, Peter. Pick up.<eos> - The subscriber you are trying...<eos> Alvin, these are Agents Damashek and Palmer.<eos> Hold your arms out, please, sir.<eos> Thanks, gentlemen. Be with you in a few minutes.
We were betrayed, remember?<eos> We had to defend ourselves.<eos> We did what we had to do to save each other.<eos> This new office I'm in, I mean, I can't be making visits like this anymore, so I need to know... can I count on you?<eos> - John 8:32.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Alvin, no. Alvin.<eos> - "And you will know the truth."<eos> - This is important.<eos> - "And the truth will set you free."
Yes, you lied.<eos> We all did, Alvin.<eos> I lied to Congress to protect the unit, to protect you.<eos> You got to live up to your end...<eos> - That's it.<eos> Go.<eos> - Of the bargain and protect us. 'Cause if you fail to do that, you're not only gonna destroy us...<eos> FBI!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Don't move! Vice President MacLeish, I'm arresting you for perjury in front of the United States Congress.
Your meeting is set for midday.<eos> I've also set up an informal dinner at the Residence with the First Lady.<eos> Unless, of course, she's not available.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> She'll be there. I take it you're a fan of President Moss?<eos> I handed out yard signs during his first campaign, actually.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> So, how long have you and Langdon been in contact?<eos> We haven't been in contact.<eos> I told you I thought he was dead.
Nice to see you.<eos> Welcome back, Mr. President. Henry. How are the kids?<eos> Sara must be, what... 53 now?<eos> Close... 22, sir.<eos> Blink of an eye, Henry. Am I right?<eos> You are indeed, Mr. President.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> President Moss.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> It's an honor to have you here, sir.
Mr. President.<eos> President Moss.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> It's an honor to have you here, sir.<eos> Thank you, Ava.<eos> View never gets old, does it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I-I haven't been here that long yet.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I can't tell you how special it is to finally meet you face-to-face.
View never gets old, does it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I-I haven't been here that long yet.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I can't tell you how special it is to finally meet you face-to-face.<eos> And I want you to know that I am open to hearing any advice that you have to offer.<eos> Well... first piece of advice my predecessor gave me was,<eos> "Don't listen to the advice of your predecessor."<eos> Well, I'll take that under advisement.<eos> All joking aside, I look up to you, sir, and I would love to hear how you think I'm doing so far.
Problem is, with everything that's been flying at you, you're not actually running it.<eos> You're reacting, not leading.<eos> But it's like I said...<eos> So don't be too hard on yourself.<eos> I won't, Mr. President.<eos> I'll let you take care of that.<eos> I'm told you had some names for me...<eos> Cabinet positions.<eos> I sure as hell do.<eos> Now, these are some damn fine people, and I think they'll be able to help you out.
You tell me.<eos> Well, you were tailing Langdon. Why didn't you just pick him up and ask him yourself?<eos> We weren't tailing Langdon.<eos> I mean, do I need an attorney?<eos> You're free to walk anytime.<eos> Right now, you're just a friendly witness in an investigation... Nothing more.<eos> Yeah, but you were following me.<eos> Mr. Shore, the Bureau's investigating the greatest crime ever committed against the government of the United States.<eos> If you can contribute to our understanding, it would be a great service.<eos> So let me ask you again. To the best of your memory, what can you tell us about this file?
You had no idea?<eos> ! You and Peter MacLeish were the only two to survive the bombing!<eos> How do you explain that?<eos> Because I was never there.<eos> I swear. I've told them everything.<eos> Tell me.<eos> On the day of the State of the Union, I got a phone call from a woman I'd come to know who had blackmail information on me.<eos> She said she had one last job for me to do.<eos> What was it?<eos> She wanted me to name you Designated Survivor.
Word's hit the street I was interrogated by the FBI.<eos> Now, politics is perception. We both know that.<eos> My reputation's been damaged.<eos> Aaron, perceptions can be changed.<eos> I'll make a statement. I'll clear the air.<eos> I won't accept your resignation.<eos> I'm afraid you have no choice, sir.<eos> Seth is distributing my statement to the press as we speak.<eos> Without talking to me.<eos> I mean no disrespect. But it is my primary job to protect you... Even from your most generous instincts.

But it is my primary job to protect you...

Take them out.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This is Contreras.<eos> Smart.<eos> What are you going to do with the time?<eos> It's not what I'm gonna do with it. It's what I want you to.<eos> I need you to convince the Russians that it's in their best interest to authorize the peacekeeping force to move in.<eos> As a private citizen?<eos> Preferably as Secretary of State.<eos> I know that you've retired from public service, but your country needs you.
Yes, sir.<eos> This is Contreras.<eos> Smart.<eos> What are you going to do with the time?<eos> It's not what I'm gonna do with it.

Aaron.<eos> So, what's next?<eos> I haven't gotten that far yet, but... I'll let you know.<eos> Well, I'll try and do the job as well as you did.<eos> No. Do better.<eos> We have so many questions left unanswered. Obviously, we still don't know who we can trust in the government.<eos> I know.<eos> I keep on thinking about the Designated Survivor call.<eos> And if Langdon didn't make it, then who did?<eos> I'm relying on you to find out.
I know.<eos> I keep on thinking about the Designated Survivor call.<eos> And if Langdon didn't make it, then who did?<eos> I'm relying on you to find out.<eos> I need to focus on governing.<eos> I need to lead this country back from this terrible tragedy.<eos> Are you still up for this?<eos> Mr. President, I haven't even gotten started yet.<eos> Good.<eos> This is a Presidential Finding absolving you from all FBI supervision.
Good.<eos> This is a Presidential Finding absolving you from all FBI supervision.<eos> Until further notice, you'll be reporting to me.<eos> Agent Ritter will be your liaison.<eos> And Agent Foerstel?<eos> He'll be at your disposal.<eos> You'll be provided with a secure office with secure communications.<eos> Nobody will know what you're doing. Understood?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Agent Wells, I hereby authorize you to use whatever means necessary, within the Constitution of the United States of America, to find the people involved in this conspiracy and bring them to justice.

Previously on "Designated Survivor"...<eos> President Moss wants to get back into politics.<eos> Your country needs you, preferably as Secretary of State.
And even though this issue is polarizing in some regard, 84% of Americans believe in stronger background checks.<eos> Joel.<eos> Staying with that, sir, many observers say the language of the bill is flawed.<eos> - Can you respond?<eos> - Certainly. I think they're right.<eos> Um, but if the Senate passes the bill to the House, I will be committed to working with Republicans, Democrats, and Independents to make sure that we pass a law that will ultimately make us safer.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Nobody's reached out to me.<eos> - Well, he's reaching out now.<eos> - I want to remind you, this bill is not about taking guns away from people.
We can never forget that.<eos> Yes, sir. Uh...<eos> I'll go check on Mrs. Kirkman now. - Okay, thank you.<eos> - Speaking of numbers, sir, we need to get 51 Senate votes in two days, which is not gonna be easy.<eos> The language of the bill is not ideal, as you know.<eos> That's why Senator Bowman picked it. He's trying to back me into a corner.<eos> Well, nobody puts Baby in a corner, sir.<eos> I didn't think you were old enough to know that movie.<eos> I had to.<eos> But we're gonna get you out of it.

He's trying to back me into a corner.<eos> Well, nobody puts Baby in a corner, sir.<eos> I didn't think you were old enough to know that movie.<eos> I had to.<eos> But we're gonna get you out of it.<eos> Diane Hunter, the minority leader, is on her way here shortly.<eos> If anyone's gonna back us on this, it's the Democrats.<eos> Unfortunately, there's only 46 of them.<eos> Good morning, ma'am.<eos> I was just coming to see you.
- Thank you for helping.<eos> - Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Bringing this bill out of committee is a pure power move by Bowman.<eos> I mean, he may be new to the Senate, but he's no virgin.<eos> No kidding. The man resigned from the governor's office so he could be appointed to the Senate.<eos> He's trying to jack his national profile as fast as he can.<eos> And it's working.<eos> There's already talk of a Bowman White House run.<eos> And he's trying to eliminate his competition, ma'am.<eos> I mean, introducing this bill without consulting you?

I mean, introducing this bill without consulting you?<eos> He's trying to take you out at the knees.<eos> Yes, well... as the ranking Republican on the Hill, I have to be careful about how to respond.<eos> - He's still a member of my party.<eos> - Respectfully, ma'am, I disagree.<eos> I think you need to push back... hard, before it's his party.<eos> Show him. He's not the only alpha dog in Congress.<eos> Senator Hunter, thank you very much for coming.<eos> I believe you know my Chief of Staff, Emily Rhodes.<eos> Nice to see you again, Senator.
Senator Hunter, thank you very much for coming.<eos> I believe you know my Chief of Staff, Emily Rhodes.<eos> Nice to see you again, Senator.<eos> - Likewise.<eos> - Please.<eos> Mr. President, I admired your statement this morning.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Let's take a seat.<eos> Obviously, we're counting on the support of the Democrats in the Senate on SB8180.<eos> And given your previous record as Attorney General of the great state of Massachusetts, I'm trusting that I can count on you as an ally.
Yes, we know it's going to be a challenge.<eos> You're not just competing against Jack Bowman here, sir.<eos> This is the gun lobby. This is the Second Amendment folks.<eos> It's going to be expensive, and we need to know that you won't give away too much.<eos> - What exactly do you mean?<eos> - I mean... we don't know your red line.<eos> But I can tell you what we won't tolerate.<eos> If we get a whiff of tax cuts for the rich or cuts to Medicare or Social Security, we will back out of this bill.<eos> You have my word, Senator.<eos> - I'm right there with you.
We got to find out what's out there.<eos> Yeah, well, not alone.<eos> Take backup.<eos> I'm gonna call Jason.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> He's a liability.<eos> He's not stable.<eos> John, they had his kid.<eos> What would you have done?<eos> I'm trying to look out for you.
I get to choose who I work with, John, and I choose Atwood.<eos> We'll check in when we get there.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Welcome back. How did New York go?<eos> Well, my Russian's a bit rusty, but we got the job done.<eos> UN Peacekeepers are heading for Naruba as we speak. - Fantastic.<eos> How did you do it?<eos> - Some good-old Texas horse trading.<eos> You know, in the end, we've got a lot more in common than we think.<eos> Except maybe you and Jack Bowman.
Do you think it was a mistake?<eos> Do you?<eos> When I heard that woman speak at the town hall, I didn't.<eos> When I talked to the press this morning, I didn't.<eos> But even the Democrats don't sound very optimistic.<eos> Welcome to the Hill.<eos> Many men have died on it.<eos> - Is that supposed to be a pep talk?<eos> - It's a reality check.<eos> The American people like you, Tom.

The American people like you, Tom.<eos> You're an outsider, and you don't owe anything to anyone.<eos> But that means nobody owes you, either.<eos> I'm not very good at the Washington game yet.<eos> To be fair, you've never really been in the game.<eos> And as for that bill, well, the wording is piss-poor, but it's got the right guts.<eos> And more importantly, it's the bill you've got.<eos> Forget about how you got here, Tom.<eos> It's just like generals throughout history. You don't always get to choose your terrain.<eos> The only thing that matters now... is fighting the war that's in front of you.
I can't take all the credit.<eos> Lege Affairs did the legwork. And humble, too.<eos> You'll get over that.<eos> Walter Dunlap, I know him.<eos> We shared some classes together at Cornell.<eos> He's a good guy, but I swear he cheated his way through introductory physics.<eos> - I wouldn't bring that up.<eos> - I'll set the meeting. Thank you.<eos> Welcome to the White House.<eos> I know I speak on behalf of the President when I say thank you so much for your courage and generosity in coming here to share your stories today.

I brought this bill out of committee to the Senate floor to show the White House that any effort to interfere in the free exercise of Americans' Second Amendment rights will fail.<eos> Senator, the First Lady hosted a number of victims of gun violence<eos> - at the White House yesterday.<eos> - Yeah, a blatant PR stunt.<eos> Listen, the White House has completely oversimplified this issue.<eos> They're making promises about safety they can't keep.<eos> Mr. President...<eos> Speaker Hookstraten.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Kimble, how nice to see you.

Well, I would be very grateful down the line.<eos> That's all I need to know, Mr. President. Thank you.<eos> No, thank you.
So, what do you think we're really gonna find all the way out here?<eos> Oil? I don't know.<eos> Must be something big for Brooke Mathison to come all this way.<eos> We're getting closer to the belly of the beast, Jason, I can feel it.<eos> Pull over two miles out. We'll go the rest of the way on foot.<eos> It's so crazy listening to you give me orders.<eos> Seems like just yesterday, it was the other way around.<eos> It's weird for me, too, you know. No, I mean it.<eos> I mean, I'm grateful.<eos> Because I tell you, with Brooke Mathison being dead, I thought I'd have closure, but I realize that's not gonna happen until all these sons of bitches are brought down.

How are you doing?<eos> I'm well, Mr. President.<eos> Just had a long talk with Kimble Hookstraten about 8180.<eos> - And...?<eos> - And... she's agreed to provide me with the political cover I need to back you up on this.
Uh, Mrs. Kirkman...<eos> I don't believe we formally met.<eos> Jack Bowman.<eos> I think you're right. It just feels like we have.<eos> Well, this is Senator Underhill, of Oklahoma.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> - Senator Higuera, New Jersey.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - And Senator Vandenberg, Tennessee.<eos> I must say, I'm surprised to see you here.

Mm, that depends on how persuasive the President is willing to get.<eos> Just give me a number.<eos> Mr. President, I think what you're doing for this administration is admirable.<eos> But some of us still have elections to worry about.<eos> In Texas. I carried Texas by 60 points last time I ran.<eos> I'd say my endorsement still carries some weight down there.<eos> Are you promising me your endorsement?<eos> Prove you deserve it, Jim.<eos> Mr. President, you're asking me to commit political suicide.<eos> No, I'm asking you to do the right thing.
You want a number?<eos> Okay. The immediate infrastructure needs of Colorado exceeds $785 million.<eos> That's a lot of infrastructure.<eos> You're asking what would help Coloradans overlook their Republican Junior Senator's vote for gun control.<eos> We're talking about background checks for new sales.<eos> It's mild. Well, if you swing that in the budget, I think I can swing Harrington.<eos> I'll confirm within the hour.<eos> If you can't find your spine on this... I may just run for the damn seat myself.<eos> There's no need to overreact.<eos> It's really that important to you?
I'm not even asking for the President.<eos> I'm asking for the country.<eos> And I'm not really asking.<eos> Look, I understand that this is Washington, D.C., and I understand that you're a politician, but we have a chance to finally move forward on this thing, maybe even save some lives.<eos> If this vote costs you your re-election, I guarantee you I will find you a place in this administration.<eos> I have to think about it.<eos> Right.<eos> I know this is hard.<eos> It shouldn't be, but I know that it is.<eos> At the end of the day, all I can do is ask you to vote your conscience.

No.<eos> No surprise there.<eos> Ms. Correia.<eos> No.<eos> Mr. Dunlap.<eos> Aye.<eos> - Senator Engram.<eos> - No.<eos> - Senator... - Feels like a funeral in here.<eos> It's like none of you have been through a vote before.
Ms. Vandenberg.<eos> Ms. Vandenberg?<eos> Aye.<eos> Vandenberg?<eos> I know her. She was appointed to fill her husband's seat from Tennessee.<eos> He was as red as they come.<eos> Richard Vandenberg voted against every gun measure that came up during his time in the Senate.<eos> I assumed she would too.<eos> I guess everybody did.<eos> Good for you.
They're calling it a big win for the President.<eos> And for the Speaker.<eos> She took a big risk, and it paid off.<eos> Yeah, well, we're not feeling so bad about it.<eos> We'll have to do it again sometime.<eos> - Sounds like we will be.<eos> - Looking forward to it.<eos> - Senator Vandenberg, sir.<eos> - Thank you, Lily.<eos> Senator, it is an honor to meet you.
So, here's something I didn't know when I came to the White House.<eos> George Washington ran America's first spy ring during the Revolutionary War.<eos> His agents relayed British troop movements.<eos> And they didn't even have cellphones.<eos> He doesn't look very happy.<eos> Well, you probably wouldn't want to smile either if you had wooden teeth.<eos> - Mr. President! - It's the President!<eos> I heard that we had some very special guests here in the White House today.<eos> Including President Richmond's son.<eos> Tyler, really good to see you again.

Wow, I didn't realize you were so excited - for a NATO summit.<eos> - No, not for NATO.<eos> I figure I'll be taking a lot of pictures on Air Force One.<eos> Um, you've been on a... A plane before, right?<eos> Ooh, not this one.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What my colleagues and I are here to determine is whether or not there was any quid pro quo involved between your trip to Turkey and your subsequent co-sponsorship of the military aid bill to that country.<eos> I appreciate your candor, Congresswoman, so I can categorically deny that there was any connection between the two events.<eos> The trip was about agricultural methods. Period.<eos> Did anyone from the Turkish military or government contact you during your time in Turkey to discuss military aid of any nature?

But, it's a chance. It's a chance I never got, Mr. President.<eos> It would take more than France and the United States.<eos> The entire alliance would have to be on-board.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> The details are all in here.<eos> In the meantime, I will need permission to open any backdoor communication with the French and a few of our other NATO partners, and we'll have to act fast.<eos> This time tomorrow, everyone'll be heading to Toronto for the summit.<eos> Let's give it a shot.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you both.
Thank you all.<eos> Kimble, please.<eos> So, how did the hearing go?<eos> Honestly, I don't know.<eos> I think I represented myself well.<eos> Aaron thought I did.<eos> But it's a hard room to read.<eos> I'm sure you knocked it out of the park.<eos> But, sir, even if the Ethics Committee finds no wrongdoing, the accusation will always be out there.<eos> Kimble... I said I would stand behind you.
In the meantime, I intend to keep doing my job.<eos> The business of governing doesn't stop, even for an ethics inquiry.<eos> Speaking of which, I met with President Richmond's son Tyler this morning.<eos> He was with a group of music students from a high school in New Orleans that had just been named after his father.<eos> Now, he told me that their music program was gonna lose their funding.<eos> How familiar are you with the federal art grants that make these kind of programs possible?<eos> I remember that bill.<eos> The sunset clause was added to get it past some of my more conservative colleagues.<eos> How fast do you think we can get Congress to reauthorize the grant?<eos> I wish I could help you and Tyler with this, sir, but it has to go through the Ways and Means Committee, which is chaired by Owen Saldua, who just happens to be leading the charge against me - in the Ethics Committee.

Unfortunately, no.<eos> I don't have any leverage with him right now.<eos> But you might.<eos> Saldua's an Independent.<eos> He might just listen to you.<eos> Okay, I'll reach out to him.<eos> Thanks again, Mrs. Kirkman, for showing us around today.<eos> No, no, please, call me Alex.<eos> Uh, it was great, and it made me happy.<eos> Those kids, they're so passionate about what they're doing, and they adore you.
What makes you think I'll do any better in the House?<eos> Because it'll give us time to organize a campaign.<eos> We'll put your profile out there in the national media,<eos> We'll drag it out as long as we can... until public opinion swings the vote in your direction.<eos> You may have just given me an idea, Aaron.<eos> For what?<eos> A last hurrah.<eos> Thank you for coming today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. It's good to see you.
Quite the opposite, actually.<eos> I'm willing to get out of your way.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> I want what's best for the country.<eos> So, I'll step aside, resign the Speakership, and my seat.<eos> I'll admit. I'm surprised.<eos> But I want something from you, Owen.<eos> I want the public arts education funding reauthorized before I go.<eos> The operation is still viable.<eos> Right now, I'm brooming any connection between you, Browning Reed, and the Capitol mission.
Well, me too. Tom...<eos> Yes?<eos> Sir, Speaker Hookstraten? Just give me a second.<eos> I'll let you get back to your work.<eos> Alex...<eos> No, we'll talk later.<eos> Kimble, please, have a seat.<eos> Did you speak with the committee?<eos> Unofficially.<eos> And I wanted to speak to you as soon as possible.
Tell me what I can do. Nothing.<eos> It's out of our hands.<eos> But, I do have a little bit of good news, at least.<eos> As my last act as Speaker, the House will refinance the arts education funding for Robert Richmond High and all the other public schools that depend on it.<eos> How is that even possible?<eos> Saldua said he'd never do it.<eos> Well, every inmate gets a last meal.<eos> I asked for a little bit of pork.<eos> You know, you're the best ally I could've ever hoped for in Washington, sir.<eos> It's been an honor serving with you.
I'm thinking of taking on something else.<eos> No, Mom, only the president gets to wave when he steps on Air Force One.<eos> I don't get a shout-out. This is not the Super Bowl.<eos> I... hey, uh, I got to go.<eos> Yes, I'm bringing warm clothing.<eos> - Okay, I love you too, bye.<eos> - Oh, love you, too.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Uh, just some NATO prep.<eos> Hey, did you know that they charge you for the food on Air Force One whether you actually eat it or not?
Are you sure you're up for this?<eos> No, I want to be here.<eos> - Tyler, how are you?<eos> - Mr. President. Mrs. Kirkman.<eos> How are the kids?<eos> Eh, they're a little nervous.<eos> This isn't exactly their high school auditorium. Oh, come on.<eos> They're gonna be great.<eos> And they're gonna remember this forever.<eos> I wanted to be the first to tell you.
Congress is gonna reauthorize the grant.<eos> - You serious?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You should thank Kimble Hookstraten.<eos> She's the one who made it happen.<eos> Don't worry, Aaron.<eos> It's not about Congressman Saldua anymore.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... The President of the United States.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, please.
Thank you all for joining us.<eos> I know that you did not come here today to listen to my voice, so I will make this as brief as possible.<eos> The performance that you are about to hear will be given by the student choir and orchestra of the newly renamed Robert Richmond High School of New Orleans.<eos> And with them today is Tyler Richmond... A talented musician himself and a great advocate for education in the arts.<eos> Earlier today, Tyler reminded me that art is the lifeblood of society.<eos> And as we strive to create a truly comprehensive education for every student in America, I realize now more than ever that we need someone who is capable and passionate to lead the charge.<eos> Now, I can't think of a better setting to announce my nominee for Secretary of Education than this.<eos> So, it is with great pride that I introduce Speaker Kimble Hookstraten.<eos> Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> It's been an honor to work with you in Congress.
Previously on "Designated Survivor"...<eos> It's about the NATO summit.<eos> The new French ambassador wanted to talk about nukes.<eos> It's an opening to de-escalate.<eos> There's enough explosives in here to blow up three Capitols.<eos> She's been kidnapped.<eos> She was looking into Browning Reed.<eos> Agent Wells is convinced that the ex-C.E.O. Patrick Lloyd's involved with the conspiracy.<eos> I'm brooming any connection between you,
Are they gonna think that it's presumptuous of me, putting an initiative on the table? Hell no.<eos> You're the president of the United States.<eos> Right.<eos> I know I'm not the negotiator that you are...<eos> Ah, don't sell yourself short.<eos> You know, we may have different styles, Tom, but I think that's what makes us a good team.<eos> The professor and the politician.<eos> You give them the facts, and I'll twist their arms.<eos> That works for me.<eos> I know how important this is to you.
FBI Agent Hannah Wells.<eos> Mayday. Mayday.<eos> This is...<eos> Hannah Wells.<eos> Hannah Wells, this is<eos> Coast Guard Station 142, Indian River.<eos> Coast Guard Station 142 calling the ship Hannah Wells.<eos> This is FBI Agent Hannah Wells.<eos> Mayda...<eos> To begin, I want to thank you all for being here.
So we got nothing. I didn't say that.<eos> Because there were so many files to begin with, whoever's been covering their tracks has been deleting them in small batches over the past few months.<eos> There are only five files still remaining associated with Browning Reed.<eos> Gonna need you to make copies and print them up.<eos> Check this out.<eos> It's a digital fingerprint left behind by the person who deleted the files.<eos> Now, they tend to be unique, but if I'm good... And I like to think I am... I can program a trace and plant it in the remaining files.<eos> So if the traitor tries to delete any of them, we can track the user back to an exact I.P. address.<eos> Exactly.<eos> How long will it take you to build a trace? A few hours?
Well, thank you. Yes.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> Our proposal is the third item on the agenda. We're on our way.<eos> No media, right?<eos> Just you and 27 other leaders of the free world.<eos> Relax, Tom.<eos> All we're asking is to start a conversation that's long overdue. Come in.<eos> Seth.<eos> Sorry to disturb you, Mr. President.
A possible traitor in the White House?<eos> Yeah. And you didn't tell me?<eos> It was a matter of security.<eos> Emily doesn't know.<eos> Neither does Seth.<eos> Well, I'm your Secretary of State, for God's sake.<eos> I mean, I-I'm in the line of succession. You didn't think you could trust me?<eos> This isn't a matter of trust.<eos> The hell it's not!<eos> Now, I came out of retirement for you. I put my legacy on the line for you! And this is how you repay me?

Well, you were wrong.<eos> You were dead wrong, and now my head is on the block right along with yours!<eos> Well, I probably should've let you in.

You don't have any.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> You can't deny the story without committing perjury, and you can't confirm it without admitting that you still don't know who's behind all this, throwing the whole American country into a panic.<eos> That's why we need Seth to buy us some time.<eos> But how much time?<eos> The jackals are at the door, Mr. President.<eos> I think we're really close to cracking this thing.<eos> Do you really?<eos> Your lead investigator is missing, possibly dead.<eos> The man who tried to kill you is still alive.
So where does this leave us?<eos> Uh, we're working on a broadened search grid, factoring in current changes, but it's gonna take time.<eos> I'm gonna be there within the hour.<eos> I'm gonna want better answers than that.<eos> Peter MacLeish was a brother to me.<eos> You kill my family...<eos> I kill yours.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I know that there has been a great deal of speculation with regards to an article that was published in this morning's New York Standard.<eos> Although I cannot confirm or deny the allegations, I can tell you in confidence that my government is in the middle of an extensive investigation that is highly classified.

But we also have reason to trust each other, a long history of cooperation and experience.<eos> Monsieur Kirkman has no such history.<eos> He is president only because the previous government was wiped out.<eos> No, my point is... how can we trust someone who appears to be a...<eos> What's the word?<eos> Maladroit. I believe the word you're searching for is "blunderer."<eos> Who apparently abused article five of the NATO charter by asking us to assist him in going after the wrong target.<eos> As I said earlier, Madame, I am not at liberty to comment on that any further than I already have.<eos> Then France proposes tabling any discussion of the U.S. initiative until the president can say more and does.<eos> All I can do... is ask you all, please... please do not allow my nation's domestic issues to interfere with our global objectives.
Thank you very much. - Good job.<eos> Great job.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You didn't get my texts?<eos> Well, I've been busy making us famous.<eos> Come in.<eos> Abe Leonard, Alyssa Abboud.<eos> Uh, are we here to discuss promotional opportunities?<eos> Actually, Alyssa's from Legal.<eos> The FBI wants to talk to you.
Abe... For weeks, I couldn't get them on the phone.<eos> They even put a tail on me to try and scare me off. What?<eos> Now they want to talk?<eos> I mean, forget it.<eos> I'm not talking to them.<eos> We'd like you to.<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> They believe that you could be a potential witness in their investigation into the Capitol bombing. No way.<eos> I'm not giving up my sources!<eos> No one's asking you to.
We'd like you to.<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> They believe that you could be a potential witness in their investigation into the Capitol bombing. No way.<eos> I'm not giving up my sources!<eos> No one's asking you to.<eos> So what are you asking me?<eos> To go in for an interview. That's all.<eos> See what they want.<eos> Why should I?<eos> Because they can subpoena you if you don't. Fine.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you for what you did this afternoon.<eos> Oh, you mean dying on the world stage?<eos> Pretty awful, wasn't it?<eos> Well, look, I'll be honest.<eos> It was one of my more colorful briefings.<eos> But your job is way harder than mine, especially right now.<eos> I appreciate you saying that.<eos> And I appreciate you not asking for more information.<eos> Well, I've known you for a while now, sir.
Well, I've known you for a while now, sir.<eos> Long enough to know that, uh, when you make a decision, it's for a good reason, and that's good enough for me.<eos> Just wish it was good enough for the press.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Excuse me. This might be important.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The Nuclear Planning Group voted.<eos> They're not gonna be putting your initiative back on the agenda.<eos> So that's it then.<eos> Sir, the First Lady's on the phone for you.
Thank you, Madame, for seeing me.<eos> You understand why we took the initiative off of the agenda.<eos> I did not agree with it, but, yes, I understand.<eos> I need to earn your trust.<eos> Oh, not just me.<eos> All of NATO.<eos> Fine.<eos> But I would like to start with France.<eos> We began this dream of weapons reduction together.<eos> And I will need you there to finish it.

Thank you.<eos> What for?<eos> For standing by me.<eos> Well... you didn't give me much choice.<eos> If you go down, I go down with you.<eos> I'm being serious.<eos> Well, I am, too.<eos> You know, you drive me nuts, Tom.<eos> You're just so damn...<eos> academic at times, I want to slap you upside the head.

Well, might even approach greatness... if you don't trip over your own feet.
This is what he's come up with.<eos> Rebooting the entire lab might bounce Kirsten.<eos> Well, for your sake, I hope he's right.<eos> You're all in enough trouble without also killing the golden goose.<eos> Don't make me regret letting you and your men out of the interrogation room.<eos> It's a good thing for you that you did.<eos> How's your son?<eos> Recovering in Germany at the Army Medical Center.<eos> I hope I get to see him before you send me off to wherever it is you plan on sending me off to.<eos> That one's on you, Baptiste.
I don't know.<eos> When you bounced, they ushered me out of the interrogation room.<eos> How many guards are sitting outside right now?<eos> None.<eos> Blair said you weren't going anywhere.<eos> Well, he's wrong.<eos> Well, the unsinkable Miss Clark.<eos> Thought you'd have bodyguards to protect you against rogue agents.<eos> - Budget cuts. - Mmm.<eos> I am surprised to see you back on your feet so quickly, Miss Clark.
- Pending relocation.<eos> - Relocation?<eos> What's that code for?<eos> Execution?<eos> Don't be a child, Miss Clark.<eos> Now, please, if you'll excuse me, I need to prepare for my meeting with Admiral Decker.<eos> He's my boss.<eos> Everyone answers to a higher authority, Miss Clark.<eos> What about my team?<eos> I am preparing a new, more trustworthy team for you, so the work of the Stitchers Program will continue.
I hope this will fool the biometrics scanner.<eos> I've never printed anything this thin and flexible.<eos> I have no idea how long it will last.<eos> Hopefully long enough.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Commander Dublin.<eos> From the Cairo office?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What brings you to LA?
Sorry to bother you.<eos> Sorry for the delay, Commander.<eos> - Director Blair sends his regards.<eos> - That's so Director Blair.<eos> Place your right hand on the scanner, please.<eos> Commander, may I see your credentia one more time?<eos> When was the last time you had this scanner cleaned? Hmm?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> In Cairo, we clean our scanners daily.<eos> - Commander, let me escort you.
- Are you sure?<eos> These prisoners attacked a fully-armed NSA unit.<eos> I can take care of myself.<eos> - I'll wait outside. Just in case.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> You got to be freakin' kidding me!<eos> Well, look who finally showed up.<eos> Told you!<eos> Kirsten, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Getting you out?
Let me guess.<eos> He didn't care?<eos> He... he said my mother's still alive, and that as soon as we perfect Stitching, I'll be able to save her.<eos> - He told you all of that?<eos> - That sounds a little crazy.<eos> At least he didn't screw with my memory of her.<eos> I will explain it when we're outta here.<eos> All right, so what's the plan?<eos> Something that doesn't involve us getting shot on the way out?<eos> No, I worked up a security clearance, told the guards I'm taking charge of you.
You know, I am...<eos> I am sorry about what I did to your memory of her, but that's why you need to keep Stitching, so you can save your mother and make some new memories.<eos> We're needed back at the lab.<eos> Something's happened.<eos> They showed up about a half hour ago.<eos> What is she doing here?<eos> She helped me rescue you guys.<eos> So, this is what rescued looks like?<eos> Oh, hi, Mitch.<eos> Great to see you again.
He said you're gonna kill my mother.<eos> Why would I kill your mother?<eos> You tell me.<eos> That son of a bitch... killed my son to tell you that.<eos> I'm gonna find your psychopathic father, and when I do, I am gonna kill him.<eos> That's my warning.<eos> Touch me again, and I'll rip out your ribcage and wear it like a vest.<eos> There are several vans waiting outside.<eos> You'll all be held for reassignment.<eos> All except you, Miss Clark.

Not so much as a library fine.<eos> How does a woman like that get tied up with someone like Stepulov?<eos> She's homegrown.<eos> She can blend in.<eos> And the Dabbur Zann has been increasing their recruitment of Americans.<eos> Let's bring her in for a chat.<eos> How do you know Anton Stepulov?<eos> Who?<eos> The Dabbur Zann terrorist that wired you a quarter of a million dollars.<eos> - What's he paying you for?
Two minutes ago, it passed through a tollbooth coming out of the midtown tunnel on its way to the BQE.<eos> That's ten minutes from here.<eos> So, Turner could be in that car with Stepulov and whatever bomb he smuggled into this country.<eos> Let's move.<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> Show me your hands and get out of the car.<eos> Hands up.<eos> Anton Stepulov... you're under arrest.<eos> Both of you, keep your hands where I can see 'em.
Okay, Patterson will run point on that.<eos> Reade, Tasha, have another crack at Stepulov, see if he'll talk now, okay?<eos> You know, I think I should go help Patterson, too.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Go help her.<eos> Keaton, you work out of here.<eos> We never got to finish what you started in Oregon.<eos> What I started?<eos> I don't hurt people unless I have to.<eos> - I'm not like you.
Keaton, you work out of here.<eos> We never got to finish what you started in Oregon.<eos> What I started?<eos> I don't hurt people unless I have to.<eos> - I'm not like you.<eos> - Says the daughter of the biggest domestic terrorist in American history.<eos> You think that I wanted to be there?<eos> Do you know how many of my daughter's basketball games I've missed?<eos> Dinners with my wife?<eos> I'd rather be doing anything than interrogating you.
You mean, the patient.<eos> You're obviously the sister.<eos> I read the file.<eos> Well, then, you know what the patient is capable of.<eos> It's not my first dance with a killer.<eos> Karen is board certified in psychiatry with a specialization in PTSD.<eos> Can you unblock memories?<eos> My methods tap the connection between the mind and body in highly traumatized individuals.<eos> I'm confident I can.<eos> I'll take you to get started.
Another case.<eos> Henrik just died on the operating table.<eos> So, now what?<eos> The Dabbur Zann attack is scheduled for 6:00 p.m. tonight.<eos> We just lost our only leverage.<eos> Once Stepulov finds out his son's dead, he'll never give us the intel on the attack.<eos> We have to lie.<eos> We'll tell him Henrik's in recovery, he's too weak for visitors.<eos> No, he won't accept that, he already doesn't trust us.<eos> - Doesn't trust you.
To be so blinded by all of your feelings you just, you miss all the signs?<eos> I do, actually.<eos> More than you think.<eos> It's terrible, but you're not alone here, Patterson.<eos> You know, Dr. Borden fooled all of us.<eos> How could you not see this?<eos> Your whole job...<eos> Your whole job is to analyze intel.<eos> You were bugging his office, for God's sake.<eos> It was right there in front of you, but you were too busy listening to the people in the other chair.
I know you want Roman to be something different, but you have to treat him like any dangerous asset.<eos> Same way that I treated you when I found out who you were.<eos> Dr. Sun is wrong.<eos> He's my brother, Kurt.<eos> He's not going to hurt me.<eos> And he is capable of love.<eos> He was in a relationship with Kat, and he loved her.<eos> Or he was playing her to get what he needed.<eos> The same way you played Jeffrey Kantor.<eos> Shepherd trained both of you to manipulate people.
- Sale's going down at 10:00 PM.<eos> - Where?<eos> She doesn't give us the location until an hour before.<eos> How are we supposed to ambush her if we can't get there before she does?<eos> That's on you.<eos> Either way, I make a pile of money.<eos> I'm treating' that HMX as a bonus.<eos> We held up our end of the deal.<eos> Relax.<eos> We'll get you to the sale in plenty of time to kill your mom.
Clark was lucid for a second.<eos> He mentioned something about "The Truman Protocol."<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> No... but, look, I'll look into it.<eos> Uh, in the meantime...<eos> Property records.<eos> For Ellen Briggs.<eos> This is everywhere that Shepherd lived before she went off the grid?<eos> Meaning Roman and I might have lived there, too.<eos> We need to send you and Roman to every one of these addresses.
Looks like someone found religion.<eos> Looks like someone found all the religions.<eos> Children, let us pray.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Bless this mess.<eos> You done?<eos> We need to ask you for a little help.<eos> Say no more.<eos> With a case.<eos> I'd love to help you, but, uh, I'm actually pretty busy trying to investigate the spiritual plane and reclaim my tattered soul from eternal damnation.
But some alumni have actually taken to using it in their post-college lives to justify some pretty shady business dealings.<eos> Like becoming a dark web kingpin.<eos> Let he who is without sin...<eos> Please focus, Rich.<eos> This version of the formula... what's it for?<eos> Oh, Gott im Himmel.<eos> This is bad. This is very bad.<eos> What's bad, Rich?<eos> Koran Surah 5:101.<eos> "Do not ask about things which, if they are shown you, will distress you."
I... if this is another one of your schemes to get me back, I swear...<eos> I had nothing to do with this.<eos> You like nice, by the way.<eos> Don't talk to me, don't look at me...<eos> Don't look at you?<eos> Come on, look at me!<eos> I'm a changed man because of you.<eos> You made me wanna be a better human.<eos> Okay, so... uck! You again?<eos> Lovely to see you as well.
Once!<eos> You have to say it one time!<eos> Enough, you two!<eos> Can members take a date to this party?<eos> I mean, it's been a while since I've been available to attend,<eos> - but, uh, yeah, they sure used to.<eos> - Great.<eos> You'll go separately with a plus one.<eos> That way, have twice the eyes and ears in there.<eos> I'm sorry, but... why would I help any of you?

You're not talking about Jane.<eos> See, this is trust.<eos> This is friendship.<eos> Equal footing.<eos> That water taste funny to you?<eos> It's a little isotope that Nas cooked up.<eos> It stays in your body for days, trackable by satellites.<eos> You leave me for a second, I'll find you and I'll shoot you as a fleeing fugitive.<eos> You are so controlling.<eos> Why do I keep coming back to you?

Phineas Gilmartin!<eos> How dare you come back here after what you did?<eos> - Oh... - Under no conditions is this man to enter this building.<eos> Phineas, you're not still mad about that?<eos> - Good-bye, Gord.<eos> - Phinny!<eos> To err is human, to forgive is...<eos> Fellas, I'm a member here.<eos> It's just a little inside joke we play sometimes.<eos> Okay, um, well... what if I were to tell you that he is a, uh, huge racist?
Reade, Tasha... what have we got on Thad Munson and Phineas Gilmartin?<eos> Phineas is an insurance lobbyist going through a bad divorce.<eos> And Thad's a Wall Street guy known as The Vampire.<eos> Buys struggling companies and sucks out every last penny.<eos> Yeah, he just did it to a pharmaceutical company.<eos> He raised their cancer drug prices by over 1,000%.<eos> This guy definitely needs to be locked up, but probably not for a terrorist attack.<eos> This is where we grew up?<eos> 15 Robin Hood Lane.<eos> According to property records, this is where Shepherd lived when she brought you back from South Africa.
Anything?<eos> No.<eos> You?<eos> No.<eos> If this is where we were raised... it should mean something, right?<eos> Well, let's take a look inside.<eos> Well, what if someone comes home?<eos> Or Shepherd could be expecting us to come here.<eos> It could be a trap.<eos> With you two...
Way too long!<eos> Oh, look at ya, huh?<eos> Hey, you put NASA out of business yet?<eos> Hey, I really want to introduce you to somebody, all right?<eos> Zach Riley, visioneer of the future, please allow me to introduce Patterson.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - The love of my life.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you were...<eos> It is such an honor to meet you, Mr. Riley.
From this point on, every member is a suspect.<eos> This is all Rich's fault.<eos> Sends us on some wild goose chase because of a personal grudge he can't let go of.<eos> Okay, is there an alumni room here somewhere where we can get information?<eos> You know, it's always about Rich with Rich.<eos> He doesn't care about other people's issues.<eos> - He doesn't...<eos> - Would you shut up about Rich!<eos> You broke up, you just need to deal with it.<eos> At least your ex didn't try to kill you and then hand you over to a madwoman to be tortured and exploit your grief over your one true love who died because you wouldn't move in with him.
Stupid, right?<eos> So what are the chances I get a full pardon now that I'm a national hero?<eos> You do realize that your work with us is highly classified?<eos> Well, don't I get a medal of some kind?<eos> Purple Heart, Silver Star?<eos> Redemption's its own reward.<eos> Ah, stupid spiritual enlightenment.<eos> Ow! Jeez, that's close.<eos> See ya.<eos> What if I told you I could help you solve another tattoo?
I didn't listen.<eos> Because you were too close to the mole?<eos> How did you get over it?<eos> That feeling of... being betrayed.<eos> I...<eos> I didn't.<eos> And... and it cost me dearly.<eos> But, look, Patterson, you still have a chance.<eos> Talk to Dr. Sun.<eos> Put Borden behind you.
Relax.<eos> He's taken care of.<eos> Some advance notice would be nice.<eos> Shepherd's not big on notice.<eos> You sure the F.B.I. knows nothing about our arrangement?<eos> Well, not unless you said something.<eos> I'd die before I told anyone.<eos> Yes... or, failing that, afterwards.<eos> Smile, Mr. Riley.<eos> We couldn't do Phase Two without you.
Let's get the hell out of here!<eos> I am an American fighting in the forces which guard my country and my way of life.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Sniper down!<eos> Dukali, huh?<eos> You know Captain Roman, but... why didn't you answer him?<eos> What happened to your friends, kid?<eos> Strigs came.<eos> With people helping them.<eos> People like you.
But, fortunately, a new species has risen to supplant them, united by a single consciousness, a single purpose.<eos> There will be no more wars.<eos> I will make sure their vicious impulses never ravage this world again.<eos> And you, Zack, can help me do that.<eos> Or you can return to being an ordinary, lonely boy.<eos> The choice is yours.<eos> Of course, you will no longer live here.<eos> I wonder how the girl will feel when she has no job and you have nothing to offer her.<eos> No.<eos> I want to help you.
Staff all been briefed.<eos> We've taken every possible measure to ensure the safety and well-being of the mother.<eos> Excellent.<eos> And afterwards?<eos> Ahem! Well, it's... as... as we discussed.<eos> I'm not talking about the baby, Mr. Desai, I am talking about the mothers.<eos> Everything is going to change the moment this first child is born.<eos> Surely, you have a plan for dealing with their reactions.<eos> Honestly, sir, I don't see how it's gonna be so different.<eos> Perhaps you should have your wife explain it to you.
Are you serious?<eos> Check his belt.<eos> It's Willy Wonka's golden ticket.<eos> It opens every door in this facility.<eos> That's great, but how are you gonna get it?<eos> We can't even go to the bathroom after what happened last time with our chaperone.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Miranda, report upstairs immediately.<eos> So, I'm gonna need your help with something, Miranda.<eos> I told you, I'm not interested.
What are you gonna do with it?<eos> Baby's going to be well taken care of.<eos> But not here.<eos> And not by her.<eos> No.<eos> Sophie's job, and the rest of the women here, is that more B-Positive babies... to increase the percentage of the population.<eos> She's gonna freak out.<eos> That's where you come in.<eos> See...<eos> Sophie trusts you, so you're going to be right there by her side every step of the way, you're going to reassure her everything's fine, you're going to tell her that her baby's in the best of hands.

Oh, shit!<eos> - We gotta move! Go! Go!<eos> Go! - Come on, let's go!<eos> - People, move it!<eos> - Wait, don't go!<eos> Move your butts!<eos> Get 'em!<eos> Come on!<eos> They want to turn us!<eos> Don't let them sting you!
But I need you to stay focused, alright?<eos> I can't repeat myself.<eos> It's all gonna be working...<eos> Miranda!<eos> What the hell are you doing out here?<eos> Nurse Ratchet gave me a few minutes.<eos> - How is Sophie?<eos> - Peachy.<eos> Look, she's scared and emotional, and everything sucks, but she's going to be fine.<eos> I understand that this is very difficult on you.
We've spotted the convoy.<eos> It's headed your way.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Do I sit here with a demon?<eos> Were you not sent by one?<eos> By the Master?<eos> No.<eos> My brother.<eos> Your brother sends you looking for demons?
By the Master?<eos> No.<eos> My brother.<eos> Your brother sends you looking for demons?<eos> He seeks your gift... immortality.<eos> He lies near death, beyond the help of medicine.<eos> His curiosity about the dark arts revealed your secrets to him.<eos> He begged me to find someone from your exotic order.<eos> My "order" is not one I'd wish any soul to join.<eos> If... money or property is of no allure to you...
His curiosity about the dark arts revealed your secrets to him.<eos> He begged me to find someone from your exotic order.<eos> My "order" is not one I'd wish any soul to join.<eos> If... money or property is of no allure to you...<eos> You'd do this for your brother?<eos> Please.<eos> He suffers so.<eos> I am indeed a demon, but my curse is my own.<eos> I have no gift, dark or light, to give.<eos> I beseech you.
Of everything.<eos> Of our decades-long conflict.<eos> Of Abraham Setrakian.<eos> Even on my deathbed, your pettiness is nothing more than an annoyance.<eos> Oh, don't you worry.<eos> You're not going to die.<eos> Not yet.<eos> First, I need you to do something for me.<eos> Then and only then will I allow you to pass.<eos> I will do nothing for you.
- What about you?<eos> My friend might be alive!<eos> If he is, I have to help him.<eos> Evacuate!<eos> We've gotta go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Professor?<eos> Professor!<eos> Ms. Velders, how... are you?<eos> I'm better now I've found you.
- How much did you see?<eos> Approximately?<eos> - None.<eos> - What?<eos> Hold on.<eos> You're telling me we risked our lives taking this convoy so that you could get plutonium and we could get nothing?<eos> I wouldn't say "nothing."<eos> You have our undying gratitude.<eos> I'm guessing The Partnership will do better.<eos> In fact, I'm fairly certain they'll pay a pretty penny to get their plutonium back, along with you and Hairless,
We've had some good times.<eos> We've had some bad times.<eos> We even had that time you stuck a tube up my junk.<eos> So how about you say you get me out of this dump?<eos> I love this guy.<eos> But let's get serious for a minute.<eos> Toby, after we installed the stint, we ran some tests.<eos> The arrhythmia was caused by a minor septal defect, which means there's a very small hole between two of the heart's chambers.<eos> Now some people may choose, uh, not to repair the hole, and treat it with medication. But I strongly suggest surgery.<eos> Let me explain to you exactly what's going on.
Okay? I've changed.<eos> I'm, I'm ready for something real.<eos> Sorry, Olivia, but... we're dating now.<eos> Life goes on after you disappear.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Thank God.<eos> We were dead without you. Oh...<eos> Well, how soon can you operate? Well, we can get him in tomorrow morning, if you're willing.<eos> Look, I can get you into my schedule, but you've got to commit now. Wow.
Look, I can get you into my schedule, but you've got to commit now. Wow.<eos> Speed Racer, over here.<eos> It's, uh, it's okay, Doc.<eos> - I think I'll pass.<eos> It's not okay.<eos> And we need to talk about this.<eos> There's nothing to talk about, all right?<eos> He said medication was an option, so.<eos> Toby.<eos> - I'll leave you two alone.
It's an arrhythmia.<eos> It's a condition.<eos> And you are an idiot if you don't think about repairing it.<eos> Said gently and carefully, to the man who has a heart condition that can surgically be treated.<eos> A mistake to start a family?<eos> This is such a bad idea.<eos> - Uh, but we'll figure everything out.<eos> - It's just, it's... - Hello.<eos> - Hi. What can I get you? Uh, Caesar salad, no dressing, no anchovies.<eos> And for you, miss?
- So, um... - Yeah.<eos> Uh, where did you and William meet?<eos> - Tinder. - Wow. - Yeah.<eos> Surprised William even know anything a...<eos> - I am. We met at our meeting.<eos> Yes.<eos> You're very funny.<eos> I can see why my father likes you. - Sexiest thing about a man is his sense of humor.<eos> Would it be okay if I had some of that Japanese whiskey?<eos> Oh, well... very nice chatting with you, Randall.
Well, don't worry about me freaking out.<eos> Uh, well, I do have to worry about it, Kate, because the thing is, is that I'm kind of in love with you... is the thing.<eos> And I know we've never said that.<eos> You got a dying man to confess his love for you.<eos> You are are not dying.<eos> Okay. What is that?<eos> Holy cow, look at the size of that thing.<eos> I am a big guy, but jeez.<eos> Look this way.<eos> We're getting ready to take you to prep. Okay. What is in that?
Sorry, Father.<eos> Because the best moment of my life was the morning I met her.<eos> She rear-ended me.<eos> Totally her fault.<eos> I got out of my car to go scream at her... but I saw her face.<eos> And I walked right up to her and stuck out my hand like an idiot and said, "Hi, I'm Joe.<eos> Don't worry about what just happened.<eos> Could I take you out for a cup of coffee?"<eos> So that's why I'm really here, Father.<eos> I was wondering if I could be so bold to... ask you for a little miracle.
He'll go in the system, probably.<eos> I'm sure they got a routine in place for this type of thing.<eos> You know, foster care or adoption.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I'll take him over to the precinct.<eos> You're a little miracle, aren't you?<eos> Aren't you?<eos> Hey, little bugs.<eos> I'm sorry I've been complaining so much lately.<eos> 'Cause I really enjoyed having you as my sidekicks this year.
Hey, little bugs.<eos> I'm sorry I've been complaining so much lately.<eos> 'Cause I really enjoyed having you as my sidekicks this year.<eos> You have really great taste in music, by the way.<eos> I guess I'm just, um...<eos> I'm a little... overwhelmed.<eos> Not about meeting you guys...<eos> I can't wait to meet you guys.<eos> I can't wait to meet you guys.<eos> I know I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but I can't wait to make Halloween costumes for you, which is weird, because I'm not a big Halloween person.
I think I'm nervous about you guys meeting me.<eos> I don't know how much you can tell from in there, but I am not gonna be the perfect mom you've probably been dreaming about.<eos> You guys dream, right?<eos> I think so.<eos> I'm impatient.<eos> And I'm... stubborn.<eos> And, uh I stole an Abba-Zaba bar from the grocery store in fourth grade.<eos> And I'm... terrified that I'm gonna make a hundred wrong decisions and ruin the chances that you guys have to lead the perfect lives that you deserve, but...<eos> I will protect you fiercely.<eos> And I will always sing to you when you can't sleep.
I think so.<eos> I'm impatient.<eos> And I'm... stubborn.<eos> And, uh I stole an Abba-Zaba bar from the grocery store in fourth grade.<eos> And I'm... terrified that I'm gonna make a hundred wrong decisions and ruin the chances that you guys have to lead the perfect lives that you deserve, but...<eos> I will protect you fiercely.<eos> And I will always sing to you when you can't sleep.<eos> And I will always be excited to hear you laugh.<eos> I bet you guys are gonna have wildly different laughs, huh?<eos> I love you so much it hurts, and I haven't even met you yet.
Soap dispenser down! (laughter)<eos> We'll fix it later.<eos> And you promised to be by each other's sides, in sickness and health.<eos> I'm never eating oysters again.<eos> And to make each other laugh every single day.<eos> Do not.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> (gasps) You guys made some pretty big promises to each other.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> But if I trust anyone to keep them, it's the two of you.
So I'm on my way down to the basement with a load of whites, and there's Kevin trying to sneak a girl out the basement door.<eos> Ever since we moved him down there, it's like we gave the kid a bachelor pad.<eos> You guys, honestly, it is so nice to be out to dinner.<eos> I mean, between the kids and the band now and your work schedule, I feel like we never get this kind of time for ourselves.<eos> Yeah. I mean, I pretty much have to go to a show if I want to schedule time with my wife nowadays.<eos> That's not really fair.<eos> Neither is Ben keeping you out till, you know, well beyond 11:00 most nights.<eos> He doesn't keep me out past 11:00.<eos> I'm teasing you.<eos> Um, Miguel and I have something to tell you.
So... see, I really need this booth.<eos> Were you The Manny?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I was.<eos> Sign my napkin.<eos> Uh... sure.<eos> Okay, come on, George.<eos> Let's give this young man the booth.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Tell you what, let me help you out there, 'cause she's gonna be coming in hot any minute now.
(chuckles) Uh, oh, good.<eos> Randall, you're here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Family thing.<eos> So, Sanjay's derivative opened up a whole new sector for us, wind power.<eos> Congrats again on figuring that out. (chuckling)<eos> I'd like to use this momentum to make a play for the Oliver Energy Center.<eos> I've got history there.<eos> I'll take him out for martinis and rib eyes, show him a good time. I'll close this.<eos> Uh, I'd like Sanjay to join you.
Can I have a magician?<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> - Right? - Okay, I'm in.<eos> Meeting's over. Thank you, everybody.<eos> Thanks for stopping by!<eos> I know, "shut the door".<eos> What just happened?<eos> So, let's talk dates for your gastric bypass.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Does the first week of February work for you?
Hey, sorry I'm late.<eos> Family's a little nuts right now.<eos> You wanted to see me? Yeah, yeah, come in, come in.<eos> Randall, do you know Sanjay Jahiri?<eos> Only by reputation.<eos> Randall Pearson.<eos> Um, sorry, I biked in from Brooklyn.<eos> Apologies if I'm a little sweaty.<eos> That's all good in the hood.<eos> So, did Sarah tell you about our potential new wind farm client?
Let's go, out of the kitchen.<eos> Hey, fellas, no touching the cake till the candles are on it, all right?<eos> My name is Inigo Montoya! Slow down...<eos> - You killed my father - Babe? - Prepare to die!<eos> - Babe, popcorn? Kevin, off the table, please. - Off the table.<eos> - Kevin, hey. Listen to your mother, all right? I know it's your birthday, but...<eos> Hey, wow! You guys look so great!<eos> Oh, my God, it's Madonna!<eos> Wow, Madonna! Have you seen my daughter, Kate?<eos> This is actually... this is her birthday party. And I know she would love to meet you.
But don't get too tired from all the singing, okay?<eos> 'cause I still want to take you out to o'shannon's for dinner. Unless you want to shake things up... - No, no.<eos> Only o'shannon's on valentine's day.<eos> That's our tradition. Best bacon cheeseburgers in all of pittsburgh.<eos> You getting the onion rings?<eos> Hell yes, we're doing onion rings.<eos> Cool wife.<eos> Hot hubby.<eos> Mm.<eos> You know, uh, for a minute there, you actually convinced me that I was like you.
- There he is. - All right.<eos> - Talk about a turnout.<eos> Sorry I'm late. Toby...<eos> Oh, you look great.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Great, looking good. Shall we go in?<eos> - Yeah, let's go.<eos> Actually, uh, can you just give us a minute?<eos> We'll meet you inside. Yeah, of course.
"That's why I'd like you two to plan my memorial.<eos> Adults make these things sad, And I want you two to make it fun.<eos> Fill it with things that make you smile."<eos> "And make sure your mom and dad help you execute your vision.<eos> No questions asked."<eos> So, we're in charge of the memorial?<eos> Apparently.<eos> It's tomorrow, right before Uncle Kevin's play re-opens, and I've already got - the flowers and the lasagna and the... - Okay.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Um, if it's all right with you two, I'd like to give a eulogy.
A young man named Sebastian insisted that I pass along his condolences.<eos> He was a young athlete who was addicted to Vicodin when he first came to our meetings and, uh, wanted nothing to do with us.<eos> But William feigned an interest in football so the boy would have someone to relate to.<eos> I'd have loved to have seen William pretend to know anything about football.<eos> It was...<eos> It was quite a laugh.<eos> He was a soft armrest for weary souls to lean on, you know?<eos> Anyway, I...<eos> I'm sure you've got things going on there.<eos> I don't want to keep you.
Anyway, I...<eos> I'm sure you've got things going on there.<eos> I don't want to keep you.<eos> Hey, that's okay.<eos> Thanks for calling, Jessie.<eos> Be well.<eos> Take care.<eos> Bye.<eos> Mr. Novak.<eos> Sorry to just, you know, barge in like this, but I really need to talk to you.
Take care.<eos> Bye.<eos> Mr. Novak.<eos> Sorry to just, you know, barge in like this, but I really need to talk to you.<eos> I'm Kevin Pearson, by the way.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - Oh, good. How'd you get in here?<eos> Oh, just bribed the assistant, Tracy.<eos> You know, big Manny fan.<eos> I came here to beg you to come to opening night of my play.
- Beer. - Coming right up.<eos> Baby, I think I figured out this toast.<eos> Baby?<eos> I refilled all his pills.<eos> He knew he wasn't coming back.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> How could I have known?<eos> You got your trip to Memphis.<eos> The girls got their memorial.<eos> He left you all with a way...
- Picking the green one?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You gonna do that one?<eos> Daddy, you wear Grandpa's real one.<eos> I don't know, sweetheart.<eos> Put it on, babe.<eos> I want to tell you what's been going on with me.<eos> About... my dad.<eos> So maybe after the show tonight?<eos> Okay, everybody, this is where I leave you, it's time for me to head to the theater.
Love, William."<eos> - Hey, Kevin, it's Ron Howard calling.<eos> Hi, Ron Howard.<eos> You're really cute, Randall.<eos> What-- what the hell number are you calling from?<eos> No, no, this is-- this is Ron.<eos> Ron Howard.<eos> This is-- this is my number.<eos> I am a huge fan of yours.<eos> Now, what-what-what-- what can I do for you?
You're really cute, Randall.<eos> What-- what the hell number are you calling from?<eos> No, no, this is-- this is Ron.<eos> Ron Howard.<eos> This is-- this is my number.<eos> I am a huge fan of yours.<eos> Now, what-what-what-- what can I do for you?<eos> Well, my 16-year-old niece is visiting us, and against my better judgment, we decided to take her to this-- this little play because it starred her favorite actor in the world, The Manny.<eos> You were at my play?<eos> And I-I'm sorry to be calling you so late, but I-I just- - I just had to tell you, man, you were phenomenal.
You done?<eos> - I am done. - Okay.<eos> - I got a little hot. - You always get a little hot.<eos> - Mm-mm, don't be cute.<eos> Well, you two sure are adorable.<eos> - I know.<eos> - We know.<eos> Look, Dr. Lee, um...<eos> I've been feeling much better, as you know.<eos> I've taken some time off work. I've been checking in with you.
I saw that.<eos> We're getting an early start.<eos> Okay.<eos> You keep up with your chess while I'm gone, you hear?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> You take care of him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Take good care of you, too.
- He would kill the chicken... - What? ... defeather it, clean it,<eos> - and then wrap it up for you. - I think I'd be traumatized.<eos> That's how we used to buy chickens back in the day.<eos> William, you know where you want to go first?<eos> I do.<eos> Should I plug it into the GPS, or... ?<eos> No need to plug anything in.<eos> - Just make a left right up here. - All right.<eos> This is where I used to live with my mother.<eos> - Just the two of you?
Like you're in here...<eos> Watching yourself outside.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Keep calm.<eos> I'm not gonna touch you.<eos> Just hold still and look out the window.<eos> David.<eos> How long were you together, you and the girl who disappeared?<eos> She didn't disappear.<eos> I told you, they... they took her.
Are you okay?<eos> Philly left.<eos> And I decided, you know, what was the point?<eos> You know, when a plate breaks, you don't fix it.<eos> You just get another plate.<eos> So I tied a knot.<eos> I'm telling you, don't touch it. - Don't.<eos> - You're stupid.<eos> Weak!<eos> Did the voices tell you to do that?
I want the key and the time machine now.<eos> Well, I can't oblige, John. What if I told you that George is really H.G. Wells?<eos> I would say you've lost your damn mind.<eos> H.G. Wells... he's in New York.<eos> He came in his time machine. You can stop this all from happening.<eos> I'm Brooke.<eos> I'm a neuropathologist.<eos> I'd be honored if you'd join me for a drink.<eos> You and I were always supposed to meet.<eos> I am completely blinded by you, Miss Walker.
What are you doing?<eos> Attempting to master the Internet and failing miserably.<eos> I really enjoyed last night.<eos> We were almost killed.Right.<eos> No, the part after that.<eos> As did I. It wasn't too forward, was it?<eos> Because I forget you're from 1893, and things were more formal back then.<eos> And I didn't want to come across as...<eos> I don't know how you used to call it... a harlot.<eos> Which you are not, II assure you.
Not to sound oldfashioned, but I do struggle with the ease with which men and women give themselves to each other.<eos> Sexual mores of today are quite baffling as it's all... it's all so very...<eos> Casual?<eos> No. It's routine.<eos> Lacking in romance.<eos> See, in my day, passion and desire... They were... they were the true result of yearning for a woman.<eos> The longing that fills you head and clouds every thought as you patiently await for her to walk through the door and say "Good morning."<eos> Good morning, Jane.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning. We have information about the man who attacked you.
And they're here to meet you.<eos> Wait, you set this up for me?<eos> You are running for Senate.<eos> And a cocktail party full potential donors never hurt a campaign.<eos> Babe, you didn't have to do that.<eos> I insist.<eos> I've been so distracted by H.G.<eos> And tonight, you're my priority.<eos> Come here.<eos> Thank you so much for you trouble.
You're going to 1980?<eos> Yes, to Glen Cove, is it?<eos> How's my wardrobe?<eos> Wait. I'm coming with you.<eos> It isn't safe.<eos> I have no idea what's in store.<eos> I'm a historian.<eos> I know the '80s.<eos> You don't.<eos> Let me help you.
Reagan was president.<eos> Greed was good.<eos> Fashion was awful.<eos> It was a time of Spandex, "Dynasty." I want my MTV.<eos> You want your what?<eos> It's a party.<eos> Just say things like "Madonna" and "Wall Street," and you'll fit right in.<eos> Right, got it.<eos> Well, hello there, you two.<eos> I don't believe I've seen you at one of the Anders' shindigs before.
I want to see the exact location of Chad's coordinates.<eos> You got it.<eos> That's the backyard of my childhood home.<eos> Let me know the moment they get back.<eos> Don't look now, but I think you're about to meet another one of your family members.<eos> Hello.<eos> How old are you?<eos> I'm 3.<eos> You're 3? Wow.<eos> She likes you.
I'm 3.<eos> You're 3? Wow.<eos> She likes you.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't believe we've met.<eos> I'm Courtney Anders.<eos> You have such a lovely home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you friends with my husband?<eos> As a matter of fact... We are friends with Bethanny.<eos> She told us so much about you two.
Thank you.<eos> Are you friends with my husband?<eos> As a matter of fact... We are friends with Bethanny.<eos> She told us so much about you two.<eos> Really.<eos> What did that gossip have to say?<eos> David, hon, you have a guest.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> Welcome to our home.<eos> It was very nice meeting you.

I don't even know why he would use the word.<eos> I found it odd myself.<eos> I was hoping you might know.<eos> Does raise an eyebrow.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> You know, I keep all of my father's research on digital files.<eos> I'll look into it as soon as the party's over.<eos> Of course.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> Can I help you?
You did the right thing.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yes, you can actually.<eos> I'm looking for the party.<eos> You got to go back outside and check in with security.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> This one's a keeper.<eos> You need to get him more involved.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Someone is asking for you.
Thank you.<eos> So he got away.<eos> And the time machine?<eos> Wells was able to bring it back.<eos> Remotely?<eos> Yes, he's got it wired up to computers now.<eos> But it was empty.<eos> John got away.<eos> Where did he go?<eos> March 30, 1918... does that date mean anything to you?
Check on Dot's old RV and see if that thing's still running.<eos> You know of anybody with any medical experience?<eos> Jacob can handle it.<eos> All right.<eos> Remember, she's just like us.<eos> She's pure.<eos> Even though things didn't happen the way they should've.<eos> Simon.<eos> We've been preparing... everything we need, supplies, weapons, for when the Merge comes.<eos> And I'm proud of you.
Aren't you supposed to be on bed rest? Thinking calm thoughts, watching TV shows?<eos> Dr. Park says the baby and I are doing just fine.<eos> Thank goodness.<eos> But why don't you two keep an eye on me?<eos> If I seem tired let me know, and... I promise to lie down.<eos> Blake used to be a police officer... like Daddy.<eos> Maybe that's why you two get on so well.<eos> When you were little, I told you if you ever got lost to go find a policeman.<eos> It's their job to protect us.<eos> I never thanked you... for protecting me.
That's how you're gonna save your family.<eos> We're gonna put an end to this once and for all.<eos> Those things... they're gonna leave us alone forever.<eos> You got to trust me.<eos> Nice of you to finally show.<eos> Apologies for rescheduling, something came up.<eos> Well.<eos> Something came up.<eos> You're getting pretty comfortable with this arrangement of ours.<eos> I don't take any comfort in the things I've done for you.

I'm sorry, but we need your help now.<eos> What's he saying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did it!<eos> He... did it!<eos> God.<eos> - He did it. - It's you! You put him in this mess!<eos> - Emma, no, no!<eos> - Get out!<eos> Get out of my house! - Martin, we need you! - Dad, come on!
Look who just popped out of her little hole in the ground.<eos> You know this one?<eos> She's one of the chosen ones.<eos> Can't you tell?<eos> Thank you.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> I offered you my help.<eos> I appealed to your humanity, your decency, and you told me to go fuck myself.<eos> So why don't you just go run on home?<eos> I think I can hear your messiah calling for you.
I'll do whatever you say.<eos> I see the end... for everyone like me, like Park.<eos> Maybe even that sweet little bun in your oven.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> They can destroy us all.<eos> Kyle and his daughter.<eos> Amber?<eos> Whatever the fuck her name is.<eos> Or maybe I'm just... going fucking crazy.<eos> I could take you to her.
Amber?<eos> Whatever the fuck her name is.<eos> Or maybe I'm just... going fucking crazy.<eos> I could take you to her.<eos> - Amber.<eos> - You'd do that?<eos> Why?<eos> What if it's real? Your vision?<eos> What does that mean for my baby?<eos> If... if she is like you, it'd be the end for her too.
We only have each other.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> I love you too, baby.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you all for helping me finish this!<eos> You've kept your faith, and I'm grateful for that.<eos> But I now know the world I saw for us isn't coming, but we can have a better world!<eos> A world purged from their darkness.<eos> And all I ask from each and every one of you, is to keep your faith just a little longer.
You should've told me you had my family!<eos> I wanted to, but I didn't think you were ready to let them help us.<eos> Daddy?<eos> We can fight the black things together, and then we can go home, and we don't have to be afraid anymore.<eos> I want us to go home.<eos> Can you do it?<eos> They're coming!<eos> I want you to open up and feel the light!<eos> Wait, baby, come here.<eos> Let them feel you!
8 months.<eos> No job history after that.<eos> He did a brief stint in Texas for misdemeanor drug possession.<eos> Ex-con.<eos> Explains their carefulness with their prints.<eos> Does he own a green van?<eos> Mm, no he does not.<eos> Search Michael's associates.<eos> Cross-check that with green van owners in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, California, Texas, and New Mexico.<eos> Uh, make, model, and year, please and thank you. Wishful thinking...
But that one was two weeks ago.<eos> They're experienced, like we thought.<eos> Crossing state lines made their serial crimes appear as one-offs.<eos> Were any of them home invasions? No.<eos> They cleared the place up before the owners arrived back home.<eos> I'll stay behind, wait for the coroner to arrive.<eos> Thanks, Garcia.<eos> I just don't feel right, not without Germ.<eos> He made his choice.<eos> Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Adams.

Ok, you don't have to be modest.<eos> Do you know what I had to do to pry you away from the B.A.P.?<eos> We're lucky to have you.<eos> Well, I appreciate it.<eos> Agent Rossi was a mentor when I was coming up, so I'm happy to be here.<eos> He said you were one of the most naturally-gifted profilers he's ever seen.<eos> By the way, you know what today is, right?<eos> Yes. I wasn't gonna say anything.<eos> Good plan.<eos> I'll meet you up there.
With the adrenaline, even the best can miss easy shots from time to time.<eos> And a hail of bullets is never a good thing.<eos> The point is to control the situation, and a shootout is one of the most uncontrollable situations there are.<eos> Anyone else?<eos> Maybe speak to his mother issues, get him off balance.<eos> I'll blow her head off.<eos> No, you won't. Your mother would be angry if you did.<eos> You think she abandoned you but she didn't.<eos> You don't know a damn thing.<eos> We know your mother loves you.

Liars!<eos> You just got the victim killed and lost the unsub.<eos> Not exactly a win.<eos> You're all regional coordinators with a few years on the job, and this is an advanced training seminar.<eos> You gotta do better than that.<eos> So what else?<eos> Well, the profile says he's narcissistic.<eos> I mean, you should appeal to that.<eos> Finally somebody's thinking.<eos> Now I remember why I recommended you for this program, agent Clark.

That's why we work so hard to build it.<eos> All right, that's all for today.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Uh, excuse me, agent Rossi.<eos> Uh, we heard it's your birthday, and in your book you said you like scotch, so we all got together and put in and... We got you this.<eos> Now, we know alcohol's not allowed on the premises, but we figured...<eos> I don't celebrate my birthday, but thank you.<eos> I'm sorry. I say something wrong?<eos> It's not you.<eos> Have any of you heard of Tommy Yates?
How... how is that new?<eos> I mean, one name a year on your birthday.<eos> Wasn't the whole deal a taunt?<eos> No. That was about power and control.<eos> This is about payback.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> I've been tracking that guy since '92.<eos> He was aware of me then, but not once did he reach out before one of his kills.<eos> As a matter of fact, whenever we got close, he went under.<eos> So why start taunting you now?
Because he said as much.<eos> Truth be told, I actually think he liked me.<eos> Yates has no family and no friends.<eos> Agent Rossi is the only real human connection he has to the world.<eos> And I took advantage of that.<eos> I wanted that rapport with him.<eos> Sir, I know, I'm late, but I come bearing um, gifts, in the form of case files.<eos> I have also sent you all digital copies, if you are of the millennial variety.<eos> And since you're all here in official capacity, and since this seminar is considered on-the-job training, we're enlisting every one of you to help catch this guy.<eos> So make sure you familiarize yourselves with all of this, and our technical analyst Penelope Garcia will help you in any way she can.
Yes. We're waiting on those reports.<eos> Go on. Victimology on Jody Wilson.<eos> Phone records, email, social media.<eos> There's nothing. Jody was merely analog.<eos> I'd talk to her family and friends, get to really know who Jody Wilson was.<eos> Very good. Her mother Mae will be here in an hour.<eos> In the meantime, get to work.<eos> What are you two doing here?<eos> We thought we would help with the Mae Wilson interview.<eos> Prentiss send you?
Thanks.<eos> But I got it.<eos> And... She's a little worried about you.<eos> We all are.<eos> We know what this case means to you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I don't need help. I've personally spoken to the parents of every single one of Tommy Yates victims, and I'm not about to change that now.<eos> Mrs. Wilson?<eos> Uh-huh. I'm SSA Rossi, but you can call me David.<eos> I want to thank you for coming in.

And he spent the better part of his adulthood as a serial killer.<eos> What if he just wanted to be normal for once?<eos> So he's trying to achieve some kind of idealized fantasy, like playing house.<eos> And then when he realized he would never fulfill that fantasy, he killed the woman who made him think he could.<eos> So what's Yates next move?<eos> He'll find another victim.<eos> I was wondering when you might call.<eos> Hiya, Dave.<eos> We, uh, found Jody's SUV, you know.<eos> We're gonna find you soon, too.

You never know how much time you got left.<eos> Clearly he's threatening me and my family.<eos> That's what I thought, too, but listen again.<eos> Family's important, right? Better enjoy them while you can.<eos> You never know how much time you got left.<eos> He doesn't sound very threatening. He sounds sad.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So what are you thinking?<eos> "You never know how much time you got left."<eos> Maybe he wasn't talking about you.
How do you like it?<eos> Delicious.<eos> What is that, bacon?<eos> Pancetta.<eos> Never heard of it.<eos> Not big on manners, are you?<eos> My grandma was into manners.<eos> Always hated that bitch.<eos> I get it.<eos> She starved you, beat you, made you wear dresses.
Even with treatment.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> Of course you do. That's what this is all about... Not going quietly into the night.<eos> But why all of this focus on me?<eos> I mean, I would understand you going back to killing, but why am I so special?<eos> I bet you'd like to know, wouldn't you?<eos> The obvious answer is, you want payback.<eos> Yes, that is indeed obvious.<eos> I took away your ritual and stole all of your power.<eos> I locked you up and threw away the key.
Yates figured the best way to get to me was to, uh, bury a victim I knew about right under my nose.<eos> We reviewed all the transcripts of every conversation agent Rossi ever had with Yates.<eos> To build rapport and earn his trust, I, uh, I told him certain things about me.<eos> Some I made up. Some were true.<eos> For example, the name of the park I like to walk in.<eos> We covered the park and the areas surrounding the base, even the playground across the street from a restaurant agent Rossi told Yates about.<eos> That's when I realized that none of these places were close enough.<eos> I was headed to the office when it hit me.<eos> Let her go, Yates!<eos> I was hoping I might run into you, Dave.

Some were true.<eos> For example, the name of the park I like to walk in.<eos> We covered the park and the areas surrounding the base, even the playground across the street from a restaurant agent Rossi told Yates about.<eos> That's when I realized that none of these places were close enough.<eos> I was headed to the office when it hit me.<eos> Let her go, Yates!<eos> I was hoping I might run into you, Dave.<eos> Well, this is my land.<eos> And I remembered you like trees.
And I remembered you like trees.<eos> Right there's the biggest one I got.<eos> Beautiful piece of property.<eos> 6 acres you said, right?<eos> Let her go, Yates.<eos> It's all over.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> How about you just let me go die in peace and we forget this whole thing.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> So why don't you just put the knife down, I'll take you in, we'll both have a good night's sleep.
So why don't you just put the knife down, I'll take you in, we'll both have a good night's sleep.<eos> See... Here's the thing.<eos> I'm not going back to jail.<eos> I'm not gonna die in there.<eos> But the problem is, if you shoot me, you save her, but then I can't tell you where I buried all those other girls over the years.<eos> Let her go.<eos> But if you don't shoot me,<eos> I'm gonna kill her.<eos> Yates!<eos> I told you, I'm not going back.
I told you, I'm not going back.<eos> Brandi's real name is Stephanie Wetherbee.<eos> She was a runaway from Philadelphia who hadn't seen her family in over 10 years.<eos> So we found her mother and fixed that.<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> We found Regina Franklin's parents in Tampa.<eos> I offered to fly down and talk to them personally, but apparently her mother has a cousin who lives here, so we flew them up instead.<eos> Some cases end well and you can forget about them.<eos> But some some become a part of who you are.<eos> This job is going to change you. And not only that, it's going to show you who you really are.
But some some become a part of who you are.<eos> This job is going to change you. And not only that, it's going to show you who you really are.<eos> And sometimes that's not easy to see.<eos> And that's why not everybody can do this job.<eos> And that's why we train like we do.<eos> Because lives depend upon it.<eos> Now, agents Prentiss and Walker were kind enough to, um, hold on to this for me.<eos> I owe you all an apology.<eos> 'Cause this was a very thoughtful gift.<eos> And what I should have done was say thank you.

That means a lot.<eos> Um... But I just got engaged and I can't bring that insanity home.<eos> I mean, that Yates case.<eos> I'm sorry, but I just don't have to deal with it the way you have.<eos> It takes time to build those skills.<eos> That's just it, sir.<eos> I don't know if I want those skills.<eos> I just can't have this become my life.<eos> I hope you understand.<eos> I want to say thank you, though, agent Rossi, for everything.
Jo Wilson isn't my real name.<eos> That's why I couldn't marry you.<eos> It might all come out in court tomorrow.<eos> You pick the bad guy... the guy who hurts you or hurts other people.<eos> Karev, what are you about to do?<eos> I'm going to the district attorney's tonight, and I'm gonna take the plea.<eos> It's just us now.<eos> There were five of us, and it can't be just me.<eos> Mr. Karev?<eos> He'll see you now.
Now.<eos> Personal effects, cellphones, keys, weapons.<eos> Who brings weapons to a prison?<eos> So many people.<eos> Arms out.<eos> Um, I-I have a prosthetic leg.<eos> I'm gonna raise your pants leg.<eos> Oh, come on, is that really necess... ary?<eos> Visitors pass.<eos> Keep them on you at all times.
What? !<eos> Hold the badge up to your face, look at that camera.<eos> Four visitors clear for Eldredge.<eos> We should get immediate access to Kristen, but you never know.<eos> Badges up.<eos> "Never know"? Why?<eos> Because Dr. Eldredge is already pissed you're here.<eos> You're doing fancy, expensive surgery.<eos> Special treatment gets the others all riled up, you know.<eos> Eldredge pushes you, you push back.
I have 26 inmates, and Rochester isn't number one on my list.<eos> If you insist on creating an unreasonable delay and obstructing my client's legal rights, you know I have no recourse but to report you.<eos> Fine.<eos> Rochester for the win.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I have ground rules.<eos> Walking.<eos> Totally normal.<eos> Don't engage.<eos> Rochester is a wild one, and I don't have time to stitch you up - if she goes off on you. - Hey!
No seconds.<eos> You know that.<eos> I'll need written proof of that.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Please?<eos> I'm so hungry.<eos> We really can't give her another snack?<eos> There are no extras to give.<eos> Really? You're starving a pregnant mom?<eos> That's okay with you?
I live here!<eos> Don't you get that? !<eos> Inmate, settle down!<eos> She's okay.<eos> Right, Kristen?<eos> Yeah. I'm fine.<eos> You know, things don't always happen the way they do in movies.<eos> I know that.<eos> Ms. Joseph?<eos> We have a call for you.
Can you show me the umbilical cord?<eos> Mm, it's still covered.<eos> This baby does not want to move.<eos> All right.<eos> More pressure, okay?<eos> Stop! Stop it!<eos> Can... can you at least take these cuffs off?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> That's... It's not up to me.<eos> I went to court to get you here.
Can... can you at least take these cuffs off?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> That's... It's not up to me.<eos> I went to court to get you here.<eos> And you are freaking useless!<eos> Let's try it again.<eos> God! What the hell? !<eos> So what's your adoption plan?<eos> With your mom?<eos> I'm not gonna talk to you about that.
I'm not gonna talk to you about that.<eos> I don't have to t...<eos> More pressure. More pressure.<eos> All right. So, then, how about I tell you something about me?<eos> My daughter lives across the country, so she's not always with me.<eos> Is she making that up?<eos> No. It's true.<eos> You ready for more?<eos> Robbins.<eos> They want you downstairs.
Do you want to know what I'm gonna name her?<eos> Sure.<eos> Ellie.<eos> Ellie?<eos> I love that.<eos> If you tell anyone I said all that crap, I'll kill you.<eos> Hey, I just ID'd an abscess without packing it or using antibiotics.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> You're treating my patients at random.<eos> I know this place looks like a shanty town to you, but we do actually keep records here, charts.
Okay, I need oxygen, suction, and an infant warmer, Eldredge.<eos> Did you hurt my baby?<eos> - No, no, no. Hang in a minute, Kristen. - What's going on?<eos> Everything is okay. Nothing is wrong.<eos> Your water broke, and you're in pre-term labor.<eos> She's in labor already?<eos> Isn't it too early?<eos> Well, she's 31 weeks, which isn't completely to term, but it's... it's far enough along for survival.<eos> I don't even have a crib yet.<eos> Kristen's allowed to have you in the room with her... for the labor.
Shh. I know, I know, I know, I know.<eos> Just tell her... just tell her... tell her I'm sorry.<eos> Tell her I'm so sorry.<eos> Tell her... tell her I wish I could take it back.<eos> Tell her that, and... and maybe she'll come.<eos> Please?<eos> We're here with you.<eos> Yeah, we got you. We're here, Kristen.<eos> I hate this.<eos> I hate you!
You want to know what she did to end up in here?<eos> No.<eos> I really don't.<eos> We're keeping Ellie for...<eos> Hannah.<eos> Her name is Hannah.<eos> Please call her Hannah.<eos> Uh, the baby will be kept in the hospital's NICU for observation for as long as she needs.<eos> And then she can come home?<eos> And then she can go with you.
Uh, the baby will be kept in the hospital's NICU for observation for as long as she needs.<eos> And then she can come home?<eos> And then she can go with you.<eos> Uh, any other questions?<eos> No.<eos> Was there something else?<eos> If this one makes a mistake, will you leave her, too?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> If you're ever looking for a new job, please... come see me first.<eos> Yeah, well, same goes for you.
Just make your mind blank, and I'll get us there.<eos> What happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I couldn't...<eos> He's too strong.<eos> It's not me.<eos> I-I didn't...<eos> - David, you have to trust us.<eos> - I do.<eos> I told you.
Yes!<eos> Dr. Kissinger.<eos> Douglas...<eos> Dennis...<eos> Kissinger.<eos> He worked with David for nearly two years, and they were making progress... real progress.<eos> Oh, let me guess.<eos> You don't have any record of him either.<eos> Perhaps you have us confused with another facility.<eos> Is someone putting you up to this?

The enemy of England, the York pretender!<eos> I want to find his wife and child.<eos> What if I don't wish to be your guest?<eos> Then you may leave your son and freely return to Scotland.<eos> He will be tended to by midwives.<eos> We will change our plan.<eos> - I will give up my claim. - No.<eos> You can't deny your birthright.<eos> And if you did, the Scots and all of Europe would abandon you.<eos> The only thing that keeps you safe is if you hold fast and they back us.
I say we gather behind Warwick, even if he is simple minded...<eos> Lizzie will not let Henry kill him.<eos> She knows he is her brother.<eos> Summon your men, my lords.<eos> The duchess is right. The time to strike is now.<eos> All this time, I thought you were the petite Fleur tremblante.<eos> But now look at you.<eos> A blazing white rose.<eos> Be my eyes and ears?<eos> Cathy will stay here with you.
The duchess is right. The time to strike is now.<eos> All this time, I thought you were the petite Fleur tremblante.<eos> But now look at you.<eos> A blazing white rose.<eos> Be my eyes and ears?<eos> Cathy will stay here with you.<eos> She has no reason to return to Court.<eos> They will simply think she's run.<eos> Wait here.<eos> I told you, I told you over and over that you must decide and you did not.
I looked for you, earlier.<eos> Before it was light. I could not find you.<eos> I was here.<eos> I was walking in the courtyard.<eos> The smell of burning made me feel ill.<eos> Where is Cathy Gordon?<eos> I do not know, Your Grace. I have not seen her.<eos> Oh, well done, Prince Arthur!<eos> - Senor De Puebla. - Your Grace.<eos> I carry a private message from Queen Isabella to you.
Then as now, two York boys with a claim in the one room.<eos> The boy is who he says he is.<eos> Then King Richard was careless.<eos> And now you must finish it and get rid of him.<eos> It is what is necessary.<eos> Mother,<eos> I am of your flesh.<eos> You made me.<eos> I have been advised by so many who do not know what it is to be standing where I am standing,<eos> to make decisions, to do what is necessary and I would be counseled by you because I believe that you do know.
Mother.<eos> I believe it was you who killed the boys in the Tower.<eos> - Your past actions would resolve me, help me to do what must be done.<eos> Was it you?<eos> Sometimes, Henry, politics takes place under the cloak of night.<eos> You did it.<eos> There are things that are necessary, for the greater good, things that must be done.<eos> And now you are resolved.<eos> We will be together on this, Henry.<eos> Let your mother guide you.
She does not come near me. She does not speak to me.<eos> She does not speak for me. Nobody listens to her.<eos> If you defy my orders, I'll have your heads myself.<eos> Oh, I've missed you,<eos> Oh, I can't breathe...<eos> I have missed you.<eos> I have brought you warm shirts and, um, fresh... Fresh bread and meat and apples.<eos> The duchess of Burgundy is close by.<eos> Cathy is safe with her.<eos> Armies gather for you.

Find my ladies.<eos> Demand they attend me.<eos> I am still who I am!<eos> For now.<eos> All that power you had, Margaret.<eos> All that hard fought for power.<eos> Can you feel it all slipping through your fingers?<eos> Because I can.<eos> You have the look of our mother.<eos> And that doesn't please you?
Elizabeth.<eos> If you are not shocked by what you will do for your children, if you are not appalled<eos> by how far you will go for those they drag out of you while you screamed,<eos> then you are not a woman worthy of the name.<eos> Mother...<eos> You're frightened.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Are we in danger?<eos> Will we go to the Tower?<eos> My darling boy, no harm will come to you, not ever, not you, my darling boy.
Allow me to put it in the most simple of terms.<eos> You want Prince Arthur to marry our treasure, Princess Catalina?<eos> Why should Spain yoke its pearl to this rotting beast that is England?<eos> You are supposed to be the peace.<eos> Be the peace.<eos> I give you this one night to consider what I have said.<eos> We have enemies, Henry.<eos> When they come, we will be outnumbered.<eos> You, Arthur and Harry will die. No.<eos> He made promises, he said he would honor you and the boys.
He saw him, Cary.<eos> Oliver.<eos> In the Astral Plane.<eos> He told you?<eos> He can bring him back.<eos> Class starts in 5 minutes.<eos> I know where they're holding Amy.<eos> I'll be going to get her in the morning.<eos> David, we talked about this.<eos> I'm not asking you to go.
An astral plane.<eos> Could we have been inside David's memory three times?<eos> Three times, we saw glitches, omissions.<eos> It's as if we've activated some kind of guardian.<eos> There's something in David's memory he does not want us to see.<eos> - Kerry.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I have a mission for you.<eos> In fact, the three of you.<eos> I'm sending you out.
Tell me your name.<eos> Amy...<eos> Haller.<eos> My God.<eos> The sister.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Kissinger.<eos> I was...<eos> David's doctor. I...<eos> I went to the hospital to look for you.
He doesn't change.<eos> You don't like change.<eos> I'm okay with change.<eos> Hon. Please.<eos> You told me about your house.<eos> You still have his voice on the answering machine, his clothes in the closet.<eos> Can't I miss my husband?<eos> Dr. Bird, don't bullshit me.<eos> You've been in my seat.<eos> If I were sitting here right now telling you how my husband died 20 years ago and I haven't touched a thing, and not only, but I keep this fantasy alive that he isn't dead.
All so it can spray new spores over the jungle, infecting more ants.<eos> When people say love, that's what I think of.<eos> A simple "I haven't seen her" was all I...<eos> Tell me, what is the point of all of this love?<eos> All the striving, the friendships.<eos> I mean, what is the fucking point of babies?<eos> - You mean life?<eos> - Yes, life.<eos> What is the point of life?<eos> All of you running around trying to what?
We should... recharge.<eos> I'm good.<eos> - You two have a fight?<eos> - Shut up.<eos> She just... we...<eos> She thinks I left her when we were in the Astral Plane.<eos> And I... I've tried to explain that it wasn't my...<eos> You need to leave.<eos> He seems nice.<eos> Have I seen you before?
All right, then.<eos> Then the next question is: how?<eos> How do we rescue them?<eos> We are just minds, after all.<eos> And their bodies... are in quite a jumble.<eos> Facing certain death, and all that.<eos> He's too powerful for me.<eos> Farouk.<eos> He's too virile, psychically.<eos> David could break you out of the dream, possibly all of you.
David!<eos> - Come here. - No.<eos> Oliver.<eos> I thought you were...<eos> Set them along the perimeter.<eos> On the chest of a barmaid in Sale, were tattooed the prices of ale.<eos> And on her behind, for the sake of the blind, was the same information in Braille.<eos> Mm. Oliver Bird.<eos> Dedicated follower of fashion.<eos> Have I seen you before?
Previously, on "12 Monkeys"...<eos> We honor time with patients.<eos> - Open up!<eos> - That isn't someone who's ever been anywhere she didn't wanna be.<eos> One chance.<eos> I can tell you how to kill the Witness.

Some might consider us even.<eos> We're about as even as...<eos> Prime number?<eos> Your brain has a rhythm to it.<eos> The same way that fractals have...<eos> Stop that.<eos> What?<eos> Please stop talking like a super villain.<eos> My directness makes you uncomfortable.<eos> I stabbed you.
My directness makes you uncomfortable.<eos> I stabbed you.<eos> I pushed you into a pool.<eos> And still you didn't break.<eos> Only my spine.<eos> But a couple of months in the dark, and you break wide open.<eos> You think I'm proud of that?<eos> No, I think you're unbreakable.<eos> That's what makes me uncomfortable.<eos> Because of you, my friend is on a mission, and now I'm having these nightmares.
It's been destroyed.<eos> I've seen a dying man, or women.<eos> Is it Cole?<eos> Cassie?<eos> I'm not the one who can see the future, Jennifer.<eos> You tell me.<eos> - This mission is a trap.<eos> - Life is a trap.<eos> What we decide moment to moment determines our survival.<eos> Huh. How's that working for you?
You're on your own, brother.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> Brother.<eos> I know I'm not supposed to be here.<eos> You're hurt.<eos> Let's get you inside.<eos> I don't think I can do this alone.<eos> I need you to come home, Cassie.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna find someone to help you.
Mr. Cole, where's Mr. Ramse?<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> Cole, you're alive.<eos> Oh, my God. Are you okay?<eos> Okay, wait, as much as I would love you to blast their brains all over the walls, she knows something.<eos> There's something real.<eos> Cole, Cole, Cole... There's a map, and it's about the red forest and everything.<eos> We can use it.<eos> No.<eos> He told you.
- You tell us.<eos> You're the new head of security.<eos> We don't know how or exactly when, which only exacerbates the urgency of our mission.<eos> Once again, we are running out of time.<eos> You spent months in Titan with the enemy.<eos> What can you tell us?<eos> They knew we'd go to Titan.<eos> They were waiting to take him from me.<eos> I was kept in isolation... by a man who eventually let me escape.<eos> Did you see anyone besides this man and the acolytes who tried to stop you from escaping?
No one.<eos> Dr. Railly... in all your time in Titan, were you ever able to discover the identity of the Witness?<eos> Learn his origin?<eos> No.<eos> You guys can take a break.<eos> I got this.<eos> Cameras.<eos> I rebooted it.<eos> You got six minutes.<eos> Dr. Railly... it's good to see you.
You bounce back quickly.<eos> You sent Ramse to kill me.<eos> I sent him to kill the Witness.<eos> You've always known?<eos> Just a suspicion... but when James returned without his brother... proof.<eos> You haven't told Katarina, have you?<eos> Smarter than I give you credit for...<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Answers.<eos> Just like you.
A real Tony Robbins, this one.<eos> Initiate splinter sequence.<eos> Follow me, Ms. Markridge.<eos> This is our secure storage area.<eos> Items are only removed from this area for preview and at time of auction.<eos> When that happens, a guard brings the piece from secure storage to the bidding floor, where an auction employee is there to receive it.<eos> Your pieces are never left unattended.<eos> How secure is this... secure storage?<eos> We expected more vault, less shelving.<eos> I assure you, this entire building is a vault,
So we're already in place before the painting shows up in the morning.<eos> Sneaking around like that gives us a much smaller window... minutes, maybe.<eos> I am not signing up for any plan that has me hiding inside anything.<eos> I am done with small spaces.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> You and Jennifer can go in through the front door.<eos> We're gonna need a distraction.<eos> You buy us as much time as possible.<eos> Once we have the Word,<eos> Jones will pull you back.
We're on the same team!<eos> Okay! Okay!<eos> The car stays!<eos> That's the new rule that I made.<eos> My prerogative, okay?<eos> Everybody's happy.<eos> God bless.<eos> No calls are being made!<eos> We'll deal with it in the morning.<eos> It was a pleasure doing business with you.
The machine cannot be moved!<eos> You're never gonna win an argument with her.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> She's so focused on saving the past, she never thinks about the future.<eos> Doesn't sound like there is one.<eos> You went to 2163.<eos> You said the world was dead.<eos> So we're gonna die either way.<eos> Why not go down fighting?<eos> I ever tell you what I wanted to be when I grew up?
- Radical.<eos> Thank you so much for taking care of this for me.<eos> Uh, no, ma'am.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Oh, Monty, can you be a lamb?<eos> Oh, I'm Monty.<eos> Uh, look...<eos> Ms. Markridge has a bit of the Brown Bottle Flu, if you know what I mean.<eos> Doing the drinking.<eos> Yeah. So good news for you... she will be nursing that hangover with a whole lot of spending.
- Come on.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> To find your mother.<eos> Come on.<eos> I got to say... you look just like her.<eos> Even got my wife's whole... crazy-eyes thing going.<eos> I do.<eos> You know, I came up working in places like this... hating people like me... pocket-broke, rich in ambition, waiting my turn.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not like you.
I don't believe in fate... in cycles or loops... but if it is all true and one day you find me wearing this at the CDC...<eos> Cassie, this...<eos> As long as it's on your wrist...<eos> It means we'll always find our way back to each other.<eos> Wearing this... means that somehow, someway... you're always gonna find your way back to her.<eos> Sometimes I think we are just stuck in a loop.<eos> No matter what.<eos> The Witness... he's your son.<eos> _<eos> Allow us to introduce you to... the Witness.
Get him to trust you?<eos> Yet you tried that, and you failed.<eos> So, I'm sorry, Alex, but I can't help you find the AIC.<eos> The AIC?<eos> That's just the name we gave it.<eos> CIA in reverse.<eos> "We"?<eos> Where was Ryan in all of this?<eos> Still working undercover for Miranda Shaw.<eos> So, the text you got with the three of you killing that man disappeared?
Still working undercover for Miranda Shaw.<eos> So, the text you got with the three of you killing that man disappeared?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not even a minute after we got it.<eos> It's like something out of "Mission:<eos> Impossible."<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> Doesn't feel like the right thing.<eos> This is a game-changer for us, the step-up that we needed.<eos> You said that there were three of you.
And they'll give you all the information you need.<eos> Do you want to get back in the game, love?<eos> Now's your chance.<eos> That is a shell of a man right there.<eos> The easiest way to pick someone up is from the bottom of the heap.<eos> You want information, seduce your asset.<eos> Why are you telling me all this?<eos> Who are these people?<eos> Why should I care?<eos> Because everyone I just told you about is a hostage inside that crisis right now.
- Okay, then.<eos> How do you know when someone's seducing you for information?<eos> You pay attention.<eos> I'd think twice if I met someone who only wanted to hear me talk, who never want to talk about themselves.<eos> Never pushes back, you know?<eos> Your mark's on the move.<eos> You've been staring.<eos> And so have you.<eos> I just don't know why.<eos> I'll tell you why... if you can keep up with me.
But I wanted him to be.<eos> I wanted him to be.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm going downstairs.<eos> In a place like this, the bartender will have Rohypnol.<eos> He'll sell, no questions asked.<eos> This guy will not remember a thing, okay?<eos> You and I need to talk.<eos> The fantasy of being an operative is very different from the reality.<eos> This morning, some of you completed the scenario, a few did not.
This guy will not remember a thing, okay?<eos> You and I need to talk.<eos> The fantasy of being an operative is very different from the reality.<eos> This morning, some of you completed the scenario, a few did not.<eos> Seduction isn't a game.<eos> It's powerful.<eos> And power always has a cost.<eos> You have to be willing to be used... violated... culpable, and even betrayed to successfully seduce an asset.<eos> But no matter how successful you are in completing your mission, waking up and accepting what happened the night before is one of the hardest parts of the job.<eos> Now, for the next few weeks, every one of you will cross a line you thought was impossible.
And I got it, what's your point?<eos> - The point is it's garbage!<eos> - What the hell's going on?<eos> We found it in the trash.<eos> The baseball signed by Thurman Munson.<eos> - Can I keep it?<eos> - No. Bag it and log it.<eos> That's what I told him, Detective.<eos> The roommate's calmed down.<eos> She's ready to talk to you.
She was a party-all-night type.<eos> She was always wrapped up in some drama or whatever...<eos> You saw her room?<eos> Bit of a mess.<eos> That's what she was...<eos> A hot mess.<eos> Sounds like it could be exhausting.<eos> Sometimes, kinda.<eos> Yeah, she was messy, self-centeend, dramatic, kinda scatterbrained, usually late with rent.<eos> It was like having a real-life soap opera play out in front of you.
Could you bring it in tomorrow?<eos> Sure.<eos> I can't find my cell phone.<eos> Ravi, can you be a total stud and call it for me?<eos> From the drawer?<eos> I'm so sorry, Ravi.<eos> I was doing the science stuff, but this new Tove Lo single is just so intense.<eos> Scalpel, please.<eos> _<eos> That's the woman I told you about.
- Oh, my God, Ice Ship?<eos> - Ice Ship?<eos> Clive.<eos> The bar downtown?<eos> So cool...<eos> Yvonne put that up.<eos> She was DJ'ing there.<eos> She DJ'ed at Ice Ship?<eos> Hashtag, my kind of cool bitch.<eos> I told you, she was so talented.
Back in the club.<eos> Liv, I get you're on this crazy brain, but don't forget we're police on the job.<eos> No problemo.<eos> I should probably take the lead on this, right?<eos> Since it's more my scene?<eos> - Not really.<eos> - I think this is our guy.<eos> Are you Sage Denning?<eos> The owner?<eos> Mr. Grumpy at the front bar said we could find you here.
I'll question Nels.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm usually pretty busy back here, So I can't really tell you much about her.<eos> There must be something.<eos> She was annoying, she was always flirting, always playing some sort of angle.<eos> It felt like she was hosting "The Yvonne Show." or something...<eos> Pepper vodka?<eos> Do a shot with me!<eos> It'll loosen you up.
Trouble, or...<eos> You know what I sensed?<eos> That she was a crap DJ.<eos> I DJ myself, so I know.<eos> I don't even know how she got hired.<eos> You're a DJ, too?<eos> Okay, so here's her check stubs.<eos> She started last month.<eos> All right!<eos> C'mon This one's for you, Clive!
Is this true?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> And it wasn't a big deal, anyway.<eos> You guys need to rethink what qualifies as a "big deal."<eos> You've already lied to me once.<eos> Let's say we had relations of a, uh... Sexual nature.<eos> Translation, she did the old bob on a...<eos> - Liv.<eos> - Men are pigs.<eos> - I've got some stories for you.
What was the purpose of your visit?<eos> Just...<eos> I knew she had a rough day.<eos> And I promised to loan her some money.<eos> How much money?<eos> What for?<eos> A thousand.<eos> She said she needed it.<eos> I didn't ask her why.<eos> And she told you she slept with Sage Denning?
- weren't you Joel?<eos> - Wine?<eos> - What makes you think...<eos> - We're detectives, Joel!<eos> We detect things!<eos> No joke.<eos> Does anyone have, like, an aspirin or ibuprofin?<eos> As Ms. Moore was saying, it appears you were hoping for something beyond friendship.<eos> You were totally into Yvonne, but she friendzoned you.<eos> She wanted your money, but she didn't want you.
Where'd you hear this?<eos> A guy, from Blaine's old crew.<eos> No doubt a paragon of honesty and integrity.<eos> I know how this sounds.<eos> I thought about not even telling you, but...<eos> You should've stuck with that.<eos> I just, thought you should hear.<eos> And I did.<eos> Nice guys are the worst.<eos> So, Sage was with you until 2:00 a.m.?
- What?<eos> - About these creepy nice guys.<eos> I need a wipe.<eos> Do you have wipes?<eos> Wipes?<eos> No, Liv.<eos> I'm trying to work.<eos> I know I have my license here somewhere.<eos> Does a gym card count?<eos> Tell you what, forget the license.
I can't believe this is happening.<eos> I wanted this for so long.<eos> I can barely even remember what being human is like.<eos> Liv.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> The syringes...<eos> They were locked in that drawer.<eos> Were...<eos> They're gone.<eos> I told you, she was at my place.
See, I know what's happening right now with the brain but it still freaks me out.<eos> Well, if anyone can get used to it, it's you.<eos> I guess I'll start looking into his friends at knights of Columbus and his bowling league.<eos> Where you off to, kiddo?<eos> I have mercenary training. God!<eos> Don't text and drive.<eos> Stop trying to control me.<eos> It's a lot different going over the wall with your gear on.<eos> Your holster is gonna snag on everything.<eos> Can I help you with something, newbie?
I like our chances.<eos> I hope he doesn't scratch any babies while he's out working the trail.<eos> Gotta say, buddy.<eos> That's more than a little offensive.<eos> Seems like a reasonable concern.<eos> Sensitivity to our kind will come with time.<eos> Any updates on the Reid-Tuttle murder case?<eos> We were hoping to interview some of your employees, people who knew the family.<eos> Of course.<eos> Detective Cavanaugh was here yesterday, but people will talk more freely to you.
He was beloved.<eos> And Anna, she was a teacher's aide.<eos> She loved working with the kids.<eos> I got the sense that Anna was finally happy.<eos> So, you maintained a relationship with Anna while her husband was in jail?<eos> If by that you mean if I helped her out occasionally...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Helped her out, how?<eos> Hey, neighbor cop.<eos> I'm so sorry to bother you but my shift starts in 20 minutes and my sitter just canceled and I know this is a lot to ask, but is there any chance you can fill in for me at the diner?
That guy with the perm. You know him.<eos> This used to be a horse ranch.<eos> My husband inherited it in the '40s.<eos> Oliver.<eos> If you've ridden the elevator or ordered a cup of coffee, you've heard his voice.<eos> He died?<eos> He built this place with Cary 30 years ago.<eos> Before the Divisions.<eos> Before anyone knew ‭how fast the world would change.<eos> They built it, ‭and they went looking for people like you to fill it.
Mom, roan is my friend.<eos> Our ally.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Why didn't you tell me this before?<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> No, Clarke, not if he comes peacefully.<eos> We will make room for one.<eos> Indra agreed.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> It's good to see you.
We're talking about the future of the human race here, Mr. Jordan.<eos> Participation is not optional.<eos> They're gonna make us go with them.<eos> It's a test.<eos> How bad do we want this?<eos> There is a way out now.<eos> When this party started, that wasn't true.<eos> Make no mistake...<eos> You choose to stay and you're choosing death.<eos> If that's your decision, I'm with you all the way.

You sure that's a good idea?<eos> I mean, we just met her.<eos> I mean, all that shit she was writing to me on the computer about credit card printers and bitcoins.<eos> I mean, no offense, but she knows more than you do.<eos> And if we're going to keep growing, get bigger, a girl can always help.<eos> I mean, alone, we're just two dudes, but she can be a girlfriend, a distraction, a decoy.<eos> Look, listen. You trust me, right?<eos> Just ask her if she wants to work with us.<eos> All right. Yeah.<eos> I'll call you back, all right?
I don't want anything from you anymore. You know why?<eos> 'Cause you've been acting like a dick lately, you've been fucking everything up.<eos> You don't trust Kira, you're drunk all the time.<eos> And now you've gone and used the fucking card that I specifically told you not to use again, Sye!<eos> I think you should just go.<eos> Just go back to Toronto, huh?<eos> 'Cause you're clearly not liking it here.<eos> Wait, is this coming from her? Did she tell you to say this?<eos> She didn't say shit. This is me, Sye.<eos> This is me asking you to leave.
All right, on you hop.<eos> He has some attachment issues.<eos> Now, come on, Pickett.<eos> No, they're not gonna bully you, now come on.<eos> All right.<eos> And that is exactly why they accuse me of favoritism.<eos> Oh, no, Dougal's gone.<eos> All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.<eos> Mum's here. Mum's here.<eos> Let me take a look at you.
Tina.<eos> Momma?<eos> Tina.<eos> Come on, pumpkin. Time for bed.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Don't that look good?<eos> You wanna get in, huh?<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> - Hey, Queenie.<eos> - They need you downstairs.
Like what?<eos> A party like that.<eos> - Downtown.<eos> - Like... like black?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Like a black party?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> (chuckling)<eos> Hi, my name's Naz, nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you, my name's Naz.
What?<eos> No.<eos> No, not even with that. I don't...<eos> Oh, come on, look, I did it.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - No.<eos> No way.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Don't you do what everyone tells you to do?
You know the girl?<eos> I mean, not per se, you know what I'm saying?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I mean, I know her type.<eos> What type is that?<eos> You know what, this coming out wrong.<eos> What's your name?<eos> How about you give me your card or something, and then I just bang you on this later?<eos> My card.<eos> If I turn you upside down, how much weed is gonna fall out?
And nothing that affected my work.<eos> It's bullshit.<eos> Why are they looking for something we did wrong when it all turned out right?<eos> It didn't turn out all right for the airline and their insurance company.<eos> We should expect some blowback. Come on, Mike.<eos> What are they gonna say?<eos> That he shouldn't have saved everybody?<eos> It's not personal. NTSB's just doing its job.<eos> Once they have all the facts, it'll calm down.<eos> Sully, they should pin on the medal and send you back to work. Sorry.
You are right where you need to be.<eos> I want you to know, I did the best I could.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> You saved everyone.<eos> Uh, maybe we should just talk in the morning.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> I'm overwhelmed by all this attention.<eos> I'm gonna be on TV in the morning. What are they gonna ask me?<eos> What am I gonna say?<eos> Sully, do you want me to come be with you?
So what was the first thing you heard from the cockpit?<eos> - "Brace for impact." Yes. - "Brace for impact."<eos> Now, uh, ever hear that before coming out of a cockpit?<eos> No, not ever.<eos> Ever hear that in any other aspect of your lives?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They could take this show away from me.<eos> Jeff was relaxed and funny.<eos> He should be getting all of our interview requests.<eos> Are they paying you for all this media stuff at least?
I repeat, I need a straight-in approach.<eos> Okay.<eos> Proceed straight ahead to runway 2-1.<eos> 2-1, Tasty 1-1.<eos> Two, I'm decreasing speed.<eos> Clear the board for a damage check.<eos> One, you look clean and dry, but you're still trailing smoke.<eos> Roger that, Two.<eos> Approach runway 2-1.<eos> One, I'll maintain chase and follow you in.
Sully!<eos> Dan!<eos> Dan, I need to know who's hurt and how badly, and I need a count.<eos> 155, that's my number.<eos> That's passengers and crew. Okay.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'll answer that question when we've counted 155.<eos> Sort of.<eos> I won't be home tonight.<eos> Sherri, I cannot believe I am talking to you.
I'll try.<eos> It's a lot of phone calls to make.<eos> It's already 7:30 in the morning in France, so you better get started.<eos> Thank you, Larry.<eos> Hey, Lorrie. Hi.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you before the hearing.<eos> Sweetheart, what happened?<eos> I realized just now, for the first time, that there were...<eos> There were 155 people on that plane and you were one of them.<eos> We almost lost you.
You got runway 2-9 available at Newark. It'll be two o'clock in seven miles.<eos> You got any ideas?<eos> Actually not.<eos> Terrain, terrain.<eos> Pull up. Pull up.<eos> We're gonna brace.<eos> Twenty...<eos> I need to take a quick break.<eos> What did you think? Hearing the CVR just now?<eos> Let me tell you what I think.
- You don't wanna see that.<eos> - It's alright.<eos> - Look who's easy now.<eos> You should have seen the look on your face.<eos> - I can't wait to see the look on your face when you're not getting laid tonight.<eos> - Whoa, whoa.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Not even if I ply you with popcorn and sourpatch kids?
- Careful, careful.<eos> Oh, god!<eos> Ohh.<eos> Help me up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> They were grey.<eos> Her eyes.<eos> It had her eyes.<eos> - That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Do you want me to get you some painkillers?<eos> Oi, Chad, you've seriously gone and broke his leg now.<eos> Weren't me, love.<eos> Fucking goat, Chad.<eos> You know you've gotta keep him out the trailer, Mini.<eos> Make us a cup of tea, then, Kel.<eos> You do it.<eos> And make sure Tyson does his schoolwork.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Told you, I'm taking Mini to the pet shop.
- To the dog.<eos> - Ain't you got homeworks?<eos> - No.<eos> You never had to do homework.<eos> I never went to school.<eos> Yeah, and look at you now!<eos> Let him go play.<eos> Go on, then, son. Piss off.<eos> Make us a tea, then.<eos> Got something to show you.
I'm not asking you to move into an house.<eos> Come on, Kelly Cutler.<eos> It's the weekend.<eos> You did promise. You know that, Chad?<eos> I do promise.<eos> You know it's compilated.<eos> You can't stand up to your dad, that's your problem.<eos> I'll show you my problem.<eos> You woke me up for this?<eos> I wanna talk to you.
Listen, Kenny, I don't know anything what Colby's on about. I never worked a Sunday in my life.<eos> Calls himself Christian.<eos> You wants to do it, you go and do it.<eos> Me, I'm not into that shit no more.<eos> Just want a quiet life, me.<eos> No troubles.<eos> What the fuck you on about?<eos> You can't sit 'round here all night.<eos> Come on, Chad. Sort it out, mush.<eos> - What's the matter with you?
A huge haul of antiques has been stolen in what could turn out to be one of Britain's biggest domestic robberies. Thieves targeted the Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire's home in Purgrove, just outside Cheltenham.<eos> The private art collection at the manor was valued at tens of millions of pounds.<eos> The loss has not yet been assessed, but is believed to be considerable.<eos> The Lord Lieutenant arrived back at his house this morning, but was unavailable for comment.<eos> Chad.<eos> You're on the news.<eos> This follows a series of identical burglaries in the area.<eos> We have good reason to believe it was carried out by the same highly professional gang.<eos> National news. For fuck's sake, Chad.<eos> They're gonna come after you now, you know they will.
I don't give a fuck, Col. Not about any of it.<eos> Who the fuck cares about clocks?<eos> I'm telling you, fuck this country house malarkey. Not worth the cars, mush.<eos> The future's in the intraweb, Col.<eos> That's where it's all going.<eos> The wise world business.<eos> No son of mine is about to start with any of that crap.<eos> What the fuck you know about computers? You can't even read.<eos> Can't be plotting dreams of another life now, son.<eos> Gonna come down hard on you.
That's not so bad, eh?<eos> Colby!<eos> Colby, where the fuck are you? !<eos> You fucked me. You fucked me.<eos> Could have murdered you for less, Chad.<eos> I'm gonna fucking murder you.<eos> See what you made me done now.<eos> It's all over, Chad.<eos> We're finished 'round here.<eos> Fucking getting away from you, Col.
Mavis, call the police!<eos> There ain't no need for that, right?<eos> Fuck you, you fucking gorgie cunt.<eos> I don't want your fucking gorgie dogs out your fucking gorgie house.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> Keep the change, you cunt.<eos> - Move. - Excuse?<eos> Move.<eos> Come on, mush. Jump in.<eos> I ain't gonna leave you in this shithole.
Fuck you, you fucking gorgie cunt.<eos> I don't want your fucking gorgie dogs out your fucking gorgie house.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> Keep the change, you cunt.<eos> - Move. - Excuse?<eos> Move.<eos> Come on, mush. Jump in.<eos> I ain't gonna leave you in this shithole.<eos> Here, look after me juk.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have come with you again.
- Yeah, I think it was just something I ate.<eos> - School cafeteria, I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, looks like Friday's corn dogs.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Why don't you shut up, Jason?<eos> Holy shit-hole.<eos> Alright, Jason, let's go.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Because I said.<eos> I have something important to tell you.
- Freddy!<eos> - What, I'm not doing nothing.<eos> Babe, are you still upset because of what fat-ass said?<eos> 'Cause I'll kick his ass if you want me to.<eos> What, I will, for you.<eos> I'm not gonna let anyone disrespect my girl.<eos> Oh, come on, Freddy.<eos> No, I'm for real.<eos> You can't let little punks like that get to you.<eos> Throughout your life you're gonna come across people who constantly wanna knock you down because you're a good person.
Come on.<eos> Come on, loosen up, Carrie.<eos> Come on, I can't pull it out.<eos> Carrie, come on.<eos> Come on, you gotta let go.<eos> Carrie?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Oh, what the fuck?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Fuck you, fat faggy fuck.
Let me talk to you for a second!<eos> - No, man, I don't have anything!<eos> - You can help me out.<eos> No, man, I don't have anything, okay?<eos> What, dude?<eos> I don't have anything, okay?<eos> Just a second, come on! Fuck!<eos> Hey, open the window.<eos> - Sorry, don't have any cash.<eos> - I can't talk to you through the fucking window.
Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Move, move. Get away, get away.<eos> - You alright?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Here.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I don't know what Gabriel sells to those freaks but it turns them pretty quick.<eos> Now, he's into some trucker speed he got into with the marines.<eos> I'll tell you right now, okay? It's a bunch of garbage.
Look, it was six months ago, alright?<eos> I never told you about this 'cause I didn't think it mattered, but...<eos> You remember that night at the auto bar?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, well... I been with Mickey but I knew he wasn't gonna do shit.<eos> That fucking prick.<eos> I just didn't wanna deal with it.<eos> I just always thought I couldn't get pregnant.<eos> After that... I just figured I couldn't get pregnant. You know, I thought I fucked it all up.<eos> You know... you know, all this shit just catches up with you.
Well, I definitely been seeing some shit.<eos> I don't know if I believe in telepathy or whatever weird tarot cards you're dealing in.<eos> But... whenever I try to think of that night I just hit this block, you know?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Like...<eos> Do you like the food here?<eos> - Warren works here.<eos> - Yeah. Can you trust him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Can I trust you, Lorna?
Okay, I get it, I get it. Just...<eos> - Jade's dead.<eos> - How did Jade die?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But he's dead and Gabriel doesn't care.<eos> He doesn't care about you, he doesn't care about Sadie, he doesn't care about anybody.<eos> Fucking squirmy, fucking wormy, right?<eos> - Hey, I'm sorry. I...<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> Fuck you, man. Hey, Lou.
Says he's almost done, getting really close.<eos> Close to what?<eos> This guy's using you just like the marines did.<eos> You're just too thick to see it.<eos> - You think I'm thick?<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> You really think this lawyer is gonna help you find your kid?<eos> - I can pay him.<eos> - And then what?<eos> What makes you think he's even gonna wanna see you?
- We met at the motel.<eos> When's the last time you saw Warren?<eos> I don't know, at the party, why?<eos> Look, Lou, I haven't heard from you in a few days.<eos> I thought you might like, just a little pick-me-up, you know?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Maybe Gabriel knows a guy, someone who's seen something like this before.<eos> Yeah, I don't think anyone's seen something like this before.<eos> I'll tell you right now.
You have the right amount, you get a good high, a quick euphoria.<eos> You've gotta do something.<eos> I don't know this lady Lorna.<eos> What if she grabs Lou and takes her out of town?<eos> Then what?<eos> - What happens to Lou?<eos> - Well, no one's getting out of here.<eos> He wants us to take her in.<eos> It's time, it's time, Lou.<eos> We're gonna put you in bed.
The fight that you've wanted.<eos> - The fight that we've waited for.<eos> - Legitimate fight?<eos> Yes.<eos> And legal.<eos> Not like this underground shit-hole.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Budapest.<eos> It's a European divisional tournament.<eos> I've convinced the tournament scouts to come and watch you at your next fight.
The winner of this fight will be competing at the European Championship that will be held in Budapest.<eos> Boyka, the scouts are here...<eos> - ...sitting in the front row.<eos> - Good. - How are you feeling?<eos> Are you ready?<eos> - I'm ready. - Are you nervous?<eos> - No.<eos> - How is your knee?<eos> - Stop asking so many fucking questions.<eos> Before you go, I must tell you, I've seen the other fighter.
This is my husband's funeral.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Except for the fact that you owe me a lot of money.<eos> I will work for you to pay off the loan.<eos> - You'll get every ruble.<eos> - Let me help.<eos> I can make things easier for you.<eos> - You get the passport?<eos> - You're late.<eos> As your manager, I advise you not to do this.
I can make things easier for you.<eos> - You get the passport?<eos> - You're late.<eos> As your manager, I advise you not to do this.<eos> Just give me the fucking thing.<eos> Boyka, if I can't stop you, then at least listen to me.<eos> You've gotten used to the outside.<eos> You're going to have to be very careful going back.<eos> Stay away from commercial buses.<eos> Those will only take you to major border crossings with tight controls.
The waitress.<eos> I need to tell her something.<eos> Alma.<eos> Well, whatever it is you want to tell her you can tell me.<eos> I'll make sure she gets the message.<eos> No, I give her the message myself.<eos> Nobody goes near Alma without my permission.<eos> I own her.<eos> I own this city.<eos> You try to talk to her one more time I'll fucking kill you.
No.<eos> Just in a hurry.<eos> You have a place I can train?<eos> Sure.<eos> There's a gym five blocks east of here.<eos> Slava here will show you.<eos> And one last thing.<eos> It's really nice to do business with you, Yuri Boyka.<eos> You're surprised.<eos> I told you, this is my town.
You're surprised.<eos> I told you, this is my town.<eos> I know everything that comes through here.<eos> But don't worry about the police. They report to me.<eos> Just remember one thing.<eos> My arena my rules.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Some bum off the street?<eos> This is no bum off the streets, Slava.<eos> Don't you know a legend when he's punching you in the face?
That's not how it happened.<eos> You're fucking him, aren't you?<eos> How dare you.<eos> You know how much I love Viktor.<eos> - I want you to leave right now.<eos> Please, let go of me.<eos> He's not allowed here.<eos> I'll fucking kill him if you let him back in.<eos> Kiril.<eos> Boyka. The arena is already crawling with fans waiting to see you.
'Cause if you don't then we don't have a deal.<eos> Don't you want to save her?<eos> Don't you want to be her hero?<eos> You walk away now, and her debt still remains.<eos> Unless you want me to sell her like a piece of meat, you're going to fight.<eos> And after my champion crushes your skull you and I will be done and the girl will be mine.<eos> Are you already at the bus station?<eos> I cannot leave yet.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What is wrong with you?
I did not know how to say it at the time.<eos> I needed to ask you for your forgiveness.<eos> For what I did to your husband.<eos> Come on. We can still get you out of here.<eos> - Please.<eos> - No. I need to know.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> Yuri Boyka, you're under arrest.<eos> Do you forgive me?<eos> It's good to see you, Yuri.
Come on. We can still get you out of here.<eos> - Please.<eos> - No. I need to know.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> Yuri Boyka, you're under arrest.<eos> Do you forgive me?<eos> It's good to see you, Yuri.<eos> - How have you been?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> I did not expect to see you.
Good luck, Nobby.<eos> No, no, you're right. I should be heading back home anyway.<eos> Got to see the family.<eos> It's good to reconnect.<eos> Take care, eh?<eos> Take care.<eos> Wait. Since you're a spy, does that mean no one knows I'm your brother?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Well, then... I've got the perfect place for you to hide.<eos> It's so good to have you back in Grimsby.
You're never alone in Grimsby, bruv.<eos> Lads.Lads.<eos> See those blokes out there?<eos> Those are Manchester United supporters.<eos> - How dare those twats show up here?<eos> - You delay them... I promise I'll burn your school down.<eos> Excuse me, sir. I think you dropped something.<eos> Dropped what?<eos> - You're in Grimsby now, you git!<eos> - You think I'll hesitate to kill you?
I need you to suck this wound in my shoulder.<eos> No, no, no, I don't put my lips on another man's shoulder.<eos> - That's very gay. - Do it.<eos> People have been chucked out of Grimsby for ordering vegetarian breakfast.<eos> That pellet held Lonomia caterpillar toxin. I'll be dead... - ...in 90 seconds if you don't suck it out.<eos> Suck hard.<eos> That's it.<eos> Don't swallow the poison, and now spit it out.<eos> Well done.<eos> Praise the Lord. I thought I'd lost you, brother.
Where?<eos> I'm not falling for that one.<eos> No way. No, you don't...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No, why are you taking those off?<eos> The toxin's coursing through the left lobule of my teste. Up the spermatic plexus to my kidneys.<eos> Suck it.<eos> As Jesus said, "Thou shalt not suck off your own fucking brother."<eos> - Do it, or I'll be dead in 60 seconds.<eos> - I've been searching for you... for almost 30 year. I could've found you in two minutes on Grindr.
Suck harder.<eos> Suck and spit.<eos> Suck and spit.<eos> It's traveling too fast. I need to be on top.<eos> No. I draw the line at teabagging.<eos> Must shake this out.<eos> It's not working.<eos> Coddy. Coddy, don't go.<eos> I've lost you once.<eos> I refuse to lose you again.
Well, that were easy.<eos> Hi.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Gotta get one of these for the kids.<eos> You have a family?<eos> I just reconnected with mine.<eos> I'm going to go home and...<eos> This killing business is a right laugh, isn't it?<eos> I understand why you love guns.<eos> I mean, it completely detaches you from the guilt of your actions.
Moira MacTaggert.<eos> It's like a ghost from the past.<eos> You did a good thing, you saved that man.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> If I'm exposed, we're all exposed.<eos> We have to go.<eos> This is our home.<eos> This is our daughter's home.<eos> We are our home.<eos> I told you who I was, the first night I met you.
My child, why do you enslave yourself?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Making you stronger.<eos> My goddess.<eos> Yes.<eos> You were right.<eos> The time has passed.<eos> There is no room for gods.<eos> - Why can't I go with you.<eos> - I told you, I work alone.
Raven.<eos> Wow.<eos> Uh.<eos> - I...<eos> You're...<eos> - Not blue?<eos> It's like you and I have that in common now.<eos> No. No, I meant... You're...<eos> You're back.<eos> I never thought I would see you here again.
Maybe a little bit up here.<eos> You are all my children.<eos> And you are lost, because you follow blind leaders.<eos> These false gods.<eos> Systems of the weak. They ruined my world no more.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you... To feel the full reach of your power.<eos> You've only have a taste of your true strength.<eos> Unlike others who seek to control you.<eos> I want to set you free.
Moira.<eos> Raven?<eos> I'm sorry, have we met?<eos> Hank, Alex, agent MacTaggert, would you give us just one moment please?<eos> Of course.<eos> Charles, why didn't she recognize me? She knew me in this form.<eos> Well. After you left me on the beach in Cuba,<eos> I took her memories of that time. Have a sit.<eos> Lucky girl.<eos> It's good to see you, Raven.
Me, too.<eos> The world's already begun rebuilding it's arsenals.<eos> It's human nature, Charles.<eos> I still have hope.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> "Hope."<eos> I was right about Raven.<eos> I was even right about you.<eos> What about the rest of the world?<eos> Doesn't it ever wake you up in the middle of the night?
"Hope."<eos> I was right about Raven.<eos> I was even right about you.<eos> What about the rest of the world?<eos> Doesn't it ever wake you up in the middle of the night?<eos> The feeling that one day they'll come for you... and your children.<eos> It does, indeed<eos> What do you do when you wake up to that?<eos> I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul... that comes to my school looking for trouble.<eos> You're sure I can't convince you to stay?
I don't care if her mother sells fish in the market!<eos> I love her! Aren't you supposed to ask for your uncle's consent before you ask for her hand?<eos> And your people?<eos> 'Dear Uncle... '... I realise this won't please you.<eos> 'You and the tribe won't like it.<eos> 'I have asked an Englishwoman to marry me.<eos> 'A white woman.'<eos> It will not happen.<eos> It will.<eos> What in God's name is wrong with you?
And how many other wives do you think he's already got, eh?<eos> - You disgust me.<eos> - George, don't.<eos> You think about this, Ruth.<eos> You marry a black, you make it impossible for us.<eos> For your mother, for Muriel.<eos> You may choose a life of insults and shame but what about us?<eos> We've only ever loved you.<eos> Father...<eos> I can't see you again.
Father...<eos> I can't see you again.<eos> Not if you choose him.<eos> This... is not how I wanted it to be.<eos> You separated from your family.<eos> I have fears, Ruth.<eos> Not just about this, but... my uncle.<eos> You can't take us all this way to tell me you have fears!<eos> Not for me, for you!<eos> For everything I am asking you to sacrifice.
I take it you need no more from me to confirm that you will not marry this man.<eos> I will confirm nothing of the kind.<eos> Have you no shame?<eos> The British administration may dictate many things in my country, but they will not dictate who I marry.<eos> They are trying to define us, based on their rules, their idea of the world, and how they see it.<eos> Seretse, do you hear yourself?<eos> These men are at the very top of government. They're powerful.<eos> - Muriel, stop interfering.<eos> - Stop it! Both of you!<eos> Father won't talk to you. You're called a whore in the street, and now this.
Our home.<eos> White woman.<eos> Is that your mother?<eos> Uh, no. No, that is my Uncle Tshekedi's mother.<eos> That is me on the day he became a regent.<eos> Uncle... this is Ruth.<eos> I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.<eos> I will speak to my nephew alone.<eos> Refreshments will be provided for her in the house.<eos> Over two decades of preparing you to be our king, and this is how you face me. A white woman by your side.
So we thought a month would suffice.<eos> It would give you, Mrs Khama, an opportunity to see your friends, see your family.<eos> You shouldn't come.<eos> They want me here and you in London.<eos> That is why you must be here, and me in London.<eos> I have to go back to resolve this. We don't have a choice in that. But if you come with me, they won't allow you back.<eos> Why else would they purchase you a trip to visit your family?<eos> You can't just go.<eos> Why would I be here by myself?<eos> Seretse, I gave up everything to be with you, but I can't do this alone.

I can't do this alone any more.<eos> And I need you.<eos> 'I need my family.'<eos> 'As soon as the baby's strong enough, we'll come to you.'<eos> My tickets have arrived.<eos> Would it be all right if I joined you?<eos> See, I don't know when I'll be back.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Why are they here?<eos> They are thanking you for walking the road with them.
Can you hear me?<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> - Sara?<eos> - Aiden?<eos> - Sara.<eos> - Aiden!<eos> - You gotta get me out of here.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> I'm gonna find something to throw down for you.
Where are you taking me?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> Hey, do you have a phone?<eos> Why?<eos> Just give it to me.<eos> I left it in the apartment where you kidnapped me.<eos> We didn't kidnap you.<eos> Kidnapping is a federal offense.<eos> Look at me, kid.<eos> There are people out there who want to hurt you.
We hired you to clean up this mess.<eos> You're right.<eos> He touched this phone, didn't he?<eos> So?<eos> That means his prints are on it.<eos> I mean, really, if I had any other choice...<eos> It should only be for a few days.<eos> You know how we feel about you here at pembroke, Susan.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> It's so nice to see you.
I heard you guys talking.<eos> Some dude on the street said there's a place in the ninth ward where homeless vets hang out.<eos> Some old warehouse.<eos> People talk to me.<eos> It's a thing.<eos> Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?<eos> I told you I can take care of myself.<eos> Fifteen years old, people are looking for you, okay.<eos> When things get hairy, i just pick out the Alpha guy.<eos> And what, he's supposed to protect you?
Sit tight.<eos> We all find ourselves on new ground.<eos> I dedicated my life to seeking the truth, but under jeanine, it passed me by.<eos> And for that, i humbly apologize.<eos> But my personal failure has only strengthened my resolve to make things right.<eos> While the faction of candor may no longer exist, I want everyone to know that I will not stop leading the pursuit of honesty, as we rebuild our city.<eos> Let the trials begin!<eos> Justice will be done!<eos> Here.<eos> May the truth set you free.
Okay, Tori. Come on, we got to go.<eos> Come on!<eos> No! Tori!<eos> Come on, load up!<eos> Alright, let's go.<eos> This way!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> What happened here?<eos> Didn't exactly sent out a welcome committee for you, stiff. Shut up, Peter.<eos> Humanity welcomes you with hope.
Caleb!<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Shit!<eos> What the...<eos> - Make it stop!<eos> - It's locked!<eos> - Open the door!<eos> - Open the door!<eos> Peter, open the door!<eos> I will find you, Peter.
Break them into a million pieces.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Conor.<eos> Mum?<eos> I have come to get you, Conor O'Malley.<eos> Why don't you run, Conor O'Malley?<eos> Why don't you run for your mother?<eos> You leave her alone!<eos> I'm not afraid of you!<eos> I will visit you again on further nights, Conor O'Malley.
Life's not really going your way today, is it?<eos> I have a house to show.<eos> I'm trusting you here alone until your father shows up.<eos> I'm not five years old.<eos> This is the correct time.<eos> Not the one on your phone, or on the computer, not even on the news.<eos> It was my mother's, your great-grandmother's.<eos> Perfect time keeping for over a hundred years.<eos> Conor, pick up your rucksack!<eos> I don't want your father to think I'm keeping you in a pigsty.
I'm fine.<eos> Mum's on this new medicine. It'll make her better.<eos> She goes into hospital once every two weeks and them... and they pump the medicine into her bloodstream.<eos> She is sick for the next few days, but she is better again.<eos> Hey your...<eos> Your sister's doing better.<eos> Half-sister.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd still love you to meet her.<eos> I've been talking with your grandma about bringing you out to LA.
I want to have my own room in my own house, my own things.<eos> You wouldn't have that in America Conor.<eos> There is barely enough room for the three of us.<eos> I don't care!<eos> Conor, listen.<eos> She is so strict.<eos> Your family, your life, your friends...<eos> Her house is like a museum!<eos> Your school, all of it is here, Ok?<eos> It'd be unfair to take you out of it.
But, Con...<eos> Con, are you listening?<eos> One day, if you look back and you feel bad for being so angry, you couldn't even speak to me, you have to know that that was Ok,<eos> that I knew.<eos> Because I know everything you need to tell me without you having to say it out loud.<eos> And if you need to break things, by God, you break them.<eos> Break them, good and hard.<eos> And I'll be right there, Con.<eos> I wish I had a hundred years.<eos> A hundred years I could give to you.
- Manny!<eos> - What?<eos> - Manny?<eos> - The party's over, everybody.<eos> Have a good night and leave right now!<eos> What you talking about ? The party just get started.<eos> This came kind of sleepy.<eos> Everybody should go away...<eos> and possibly get cover<eos> What is got in to you ?
- Yes, we are!<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes!<eos> [Ruby howling]<eos> [car honking]<eos> I got the red line drafted, that's right.<eos> - Hey.<eos> -I'm waiting for the counter.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I'll call you back.
- Yes.<eos> - To the competition?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - They gave me the whole weekend.<eos> -Oh,mom,Iamsoexcited.<eos> Yeah, me too!<eos> - Whoa!<eos> I'm late.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Mom, I'll call you back, okay?
I forgot I had that.<eos> And next time, pick on someone your own size!<eos> You bully!<eos> Take care of her, will you?<eos> She may look old and rusty, but she is a classic!<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> We both know that my theater has been going through some pretty rough times lately.<eos> But as the saying goes, "For every cloud, a silver lining." We've got...<eos> Hold on right there, Buster.<eos> My dad, he heard I was gonna see you today and he was all like,
I made you some coffee.<eos> You did?<eos> Where is it?<eos> I got a little thirsty on the way up those stairs.<eos> Shall I go open the doors now?<eos> The doors?<eos> You've got a lot of animals waiting in line to audition, Mr. Moon.<eos> I do?<eos> Holy moly, I really do.<eos> I swear to you, Eddie!
Um, wait a second.<eos> Rosita.<eos> Is Rosita still here?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I'm here!<eos> Rosita, Rosita, Rosita. "Great set of pipes,<eos> "but boring to watch."<eos> I knew it.<eos> So, what should I do?<eos> I could partner you up with Gunter.
She told the whole street about your audition.<eos> Mom, no, wait.<eos> Shush, baby.<eos> You need to save that singing voice of yours.<eos> So, from now on, just nod or shake your head, okay?<eos> How was that, Dad?<eos> You're still too soft on 'em corners, Johnny.<eos> You got to attack 'em.<eos> - '- the gears.<eos> I told you, you got to be gentle with the...
You're still too soft on 'em corners, Johnny.<eos> You got to attack 'em.<eos> - '- the gears.<eos> I told you, you got to be gentle with the...<eos> Look, turn that down. Oi!<eos> Listen to your father!<eos> "Too soft on the corners, Johnny."<eos> "You're not doin' it right, Johnny.<eos> Speed up, Johnny."<eos> "Do it like I showed you..."
Come back tomorrow.<eos> Get lost!<eos> You losers.<eos> Sitting here dreaming of America won't help you.<eos> But staring at Aryan's photo will help you?<eos> - Two minutes to go.<eos> - All done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How much?<eos> Forget it. Can't charge you for 5 minutes.
Tell him your father got it especially for him.<eos> - From Chandni Chowk.<eos> - Why tell him?<eos> I'll show him<eos> I'll show Aryan a family selfie.<eos> Come, we'll get the background.<eos> Mummy, hold the box.<eos> I'll hold the trophy.<eos> Papa, hide those undies.<eos> - Shall I drop you at the station?
Actually you're right.<eos> But not this moron.<eos> The video has gone viral. Social media is abuzz.<eos> Join us for the stock market news after this short break<eos> Aryan, wake up!<eos> What happened?<eos> Did you sleep here all night?<eos> I was reading a script. It was so good that I dozed off<eos> Sunaina is here.<eos> She has something to wake you up with.
I was busy.<eos> Gaurav, we're worried about you.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You'll come home soon?<eos> Tell Papa to mind the Cyber Cafe.<eos> Are you eating properly?<eos> The food is fine here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come, hero.<eos> Sir wants you.
But you never see me.<eos> Now when I'm not there, you're longing to see me.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> I felt it among the crowd in front of your house.<eos> Sir, the Bhutianis are waiting.<eos> The audience interaction...<eos> Yeah. I'm coming.<eos> - I'll take care of it.<eos> - Thank you<eos> I'll come back and see you.
I knew it.<eos> Why is he standing with his back to me?<eos> It's not like him.<eos> He's going on stage soon, he's just nervous.<eos> Him?<eos> And nervous?<eos> Has he done anything in life besides copying Aryan?<eos> Hey Superstar, your make-up...<eos> Neha.<eos> I have to talk to you.
But I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.<eos> She had a photograph in her office.<eos> Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.<eos> As a kid, that was pretty cool.<eos> But, it was a lot to live up to.<eos> Which is why I never told anyone we were related.<eos> I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage at a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either.<eos> And she said, compromise when you can.<eos> When you can't, don't.<eos> Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right.
I read about you at the museum.<eos> They've set the perimeter.<eos> I know you're nervous.<eos> And you have plenty of reason to be.<eos> But you're lying.<eos> I wasn't in Vienna.<eos> I don't do that anymore.<eos> They're entering the building.<eos> Well, the people who think you did are coming here now.<eos> And they're not planning on taking you alive.
I can-I can see in those. Okay?<eos> It's just that... when...whatever happened happened, it's like my senses have been dialed to 11.<eos> There's way too much input, so... they just kinda help me focus.<eos> You're in dire need of an upgrade.<eos> Systemic, top to bottom.<eos> 100-point restoration.<eos> That's why I'm here<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I got to know. What's your MO.<eos> What gets you out of that twin bed in the morning?
- Everyone's got a gimmick now.<eos> You have a metal arm?<eos> That is awesome, dude!<eos> You have the right to remain silent!<eos> Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either.<eos> - Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.<eos> - You locked me in my room.<eos> Okay.<eos> First, that's an exaggeration.<eos> Second, I did it to protect you.
- How is he?<eos> - He's okay, I guess.<eos> He really wants to go to Reed, but Boone keeps pushing him toward Stanford 'cause it's more prestigious.<eos> I can't really say anything 'cause I didn't even go to college, so...<eos> How about some drinks over here?<eos> Well, he's a smart kid.<eos> He'll do fine wherever he is.<eos> I just wish I knew how to help him.<eos> I just read something.<eos> If someone says vicious things to you, it's the same to your brain waves reacting or something...
I'm not afraid.<eos> Stay out of it or you're sleeping in my armpit.<eos> You, stop it.<eos> That is not a heart. It is a curse.<eos> The second I took it, I got blasted outta the sky... and I lost my hook.<eos> Get it away from me.<eos> Get this away?<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> I'm a demigod, okay?<eos> Stop that. I will smite you!
Nope.<eos> Nope.<eos> No.<eos> Tried that one already.<eos> You're measuring the stars, not giving the sky a high-five.<eos> If the current's warm, you're going the right way.<eos> It's cold.<eos> Wait, it's getting warmer.<eos> That is disgusting!<eos> What is wrong with you?
No.<eos> Me.<eos> You are gonna stay here with the other chicken.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Come on. That was a good one.<eos> How do you not get it?<eos> I called her a chicken, there's a chicken on the boat.<eos> I know she's human, but that's not the...<eos> You know what? Forget it. Forget it!<eos> I'm not explaining it to you.
Except... maybe as bait.<eos> Huh?<eos> Wow!<eos> The shiny, glittery cave.<eos> And just like me... it is covered in sparkly treasure.<eos> Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.<eos> You're not selling it!<eos> This is stupid!<eos> I'm just gonna walk up and get it!<eos> You go up there, he will kill you.
Chasing the love of these humans<eos> Who made you feel wanted<eos> You tried to be tough<eos> But your armor's just not hard enough<eos> Maui, now it's time to kick your heinie<eos> Ever seen someone so shiny<eos> Soak it in 'Cause it's the last you'll ever see<eos> C'est la vie Mon ami<eos> I'm so shiny<eos> Now I eat you so prepare your final plea
Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!<eos> Hey, Te Kā!<eos> Shark head!<eos> Cheeeehoooo!<eos> Moana!<eos> Get the heart to the spiral!<eos> Te Fiti... it's gone.<eos> Te Kā!<eos> Let her come to me.<eos> I have crossed the horizon to find you
Once you're safe, there's only going to be one.<eos> Him. But they'll never let you near him.<eos> They'll never know I was there.<eos> I want you to hold on to something for me.<eos> Until I come back.<eos> My father gave this to me.<eos> It's the only memory I have of him.<eos> I'll keep it safe.<eos> That's Crain's guy.<eos> Look at me. Remember, I'll make sure they get you home.

Mr. Crain, I have him right here.<eos> Tell me how to find you face-to-face.<eos> Are we done?<eos> Follow me.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Please, don't move.<eos> I'd listen to her if I were you, Arthur.<eos> No need for guards or guns when the man you want's sitting on a pound of Semtex.<eos> How did you find me, Riah?<eos> What, no, "Hello. Nice to see you after all these years"?
I need you to eliminate three people.<eos> And this is the first.<eos> His name is Krill.<eos> Mass-murderer and warlord.<eos> He's also the highest-profile arms dealer in Africa.<eos> He's imprisoned on Penjara Kaedah in Malaysia.<eos> His imprisonment is what keeps him secure.<eos> It's impossible for his enemies to get to him.<eos> And this?<eos> It's important that you swallow it only after the kill, or the fuel cell will degrade and we'll never find you.
Getting him alone will be your main challenge.<eos> Shark repellent. Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's powerful stuff.<eos> Hope you know what you're doing.<eos> What?<eos> What? What do you want, huh?<eos> Martin Basman, you are under arrest.<eos> Bishop, remember, it has to look like an accident.<eos> If he dies with a knife in his back, no one will be there to pick you up.
You're a dead man, Bishop.<eos> You might get off the boat, but you'll never swim far enough away before she blows.<eos> Who said I was swimming?<eos> Were there any survivors?<eos> No.<eos> So Bishop never made it.<eos> Even legends die.<eos> Dear Mei. I'm back in Cambodia with the kids.<eos> The water filter's working.<eos> Thank you so much for your generous gift.
I dunno about that.<eos> I got a game to play but good night to you guys.<eos> What?<eos> Apparently the Watchers like us together.<eos> I mean, you can't even go to the city, right?<eos> You know, I can't go to the city, yeah.<eos> I'm not even playing, I was just doing one dare.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> It's 200 bucks. - She's pretty sure, man.<eos> He always tell you what to do?
A lighthouse?<eos> I love it, thank you.<eos> Well, a very wise person once said, and this was earlier today, they said that the lighthouse represents the thing that you want the most.<eos> So, whatever that is, I hope you get it.<eos> How many followers does she have now?<eos> I mean, to be fair, you did tell her to take a risk.<eos> This isn't what I meant, Liv.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Sydney.<eos> Okay, now they're asking if I can trust you.
I can't, I can't, I can't.<eos> I bail, I bail, I bail.<eos> You bail.<eos> - You fail. - Someone help him out of there.<eos> You fail.<eos> This is so dumb.<eos> - Hey, come here, hold on. - You fail. What are you doing, get over here.<eos> Vee.<eos> Hi, oh, my gosh, you guys are so famous right now.<eos> Oh, wait till Syd sees you.
Hello, Vee.<eos> You broke the rules, you are our prisoner.<eos> We told you not to snitch.<eos> Now we control your life.<eos> We control your family.<eos> We control your future.<eos> The only way out is to win the ﬁnal round.<eos> Go to the Staten Island ferry and the Watchers will ﬁnd you.<eos> See you in the ﬁnals, see you in the ﬁnals...<eos> I'm coming for you, Vee!
I'm sorry for bringing you into all this.<eos> I just wish that we could've met some other way. I don't.<eos> And you.<eos> What a rock star. Looks like I can get all your money back.<eos> They don't call me Hacker Kween for nothin'.<eos> - Really? Thanks. - Yeah.<eos> - Crazy first date, huh?<eos> - Is that what that was?<eos> By the way, my real name is Sam.<eos> Well, it's nice to meet you, Sam.

Thank you, Nick.<eos> Thank you, Nick.<eos> Yeah, I'll say hi to Jim for ya.<eos> They look like this.<eos> Oh, like a spark plug?<eos> Yeah, thanks, Matt.<eos> Somebody here?<eos> Okay, if there's somebody here, show yourself.<eos> All right, look.<eos> We're not here to hurt you, okay?
Yeah.<eos> The veil has been lifted, and the fallen shall rise.<eos> Children of the void, sons of chaos, it is the last hour.<eos> The hebdomad is complete.<eos> We have been remade by Yaldabaoth in the image of the seven Archons who created and enslaved this world.<eos> We are the hidden masters.<eos> We are the architects of anarchy.<eos> We are the dark fucking soul eaters, lords of the unrighteous.<eos> Today our new reign begins in a new reality!<eos> I told you!

Pray proceed.<eos> Well, as some of you may have noticed, your mother and I really are under a lot of pressure at the moment.<eos> Like the rest of the country.<eos> I haven't had a single commission this year.<eos> Your mother is down to a three-day week. It doesn't look like it's going to get much brighter.<eos> So we had a look at our accounts, and... well, we-we see we could make a significant saving if we altered the education situation.<eos> What education situation?<eos> - Well...<eos> - She means your school.<eos> They're taking you out of school.

Now all we need is other musicians.<eos> Do yous know any?<eos> - No.<eos> - Eamon?<eos> He usually just plays on his own.<eos> Don't you, love?<eos> Right, well, we can't get any peace in here.<eos> Let's continue this meeting outside.<eos> No smoking now.<eos> Ma, how many times do I have to tell you?
Okay, so we're playing over here, and Raphina's standing over there against the wall.<eos> I go up to you and start singing to you.<eos> Make sure to pan up to her eyes when I sing the line, "She's got dangerous eyes."<eos> I think a zoom would be better.<eos> Okay, a zoom, whatever.<eos> Do you think I should have, like, lightning flashes on my eyelids when I close 'em?<eos> Can you do that?<eos> I can do anything.<eos> Cool.<eos> So then for the chorus, you walk off and I follow, circling you like when he's following her in the "Thriller" video.

He's not in school, Barry, you spanner.<eos> You know I am gonna kill you one of these days.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> - 'Cause you don't even exist.<eos> - What?<eos> Maybe you're living in my world; I'm not living in yours.<eos> You're just material for my songs.<eos> Man, I'd be very careful about what you say to me next.<eos> Floor him, Barry.<eos> I don't want to have to batter you again.
Why?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Come on, Darren.<eos> We've got one more thing to do.<eos> Now leave this to me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who's that, Barry?<eos> If it's the TV license man, tell him to piss off.<eos> What do yous want?<eos> - We want to talk to you.

Understand?<eos> Enough is enough.<eos> - You're not welcome anymore.<eos> - Did you hear that?<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> You don't fuck with us, you bastard.<eos> What's up, pal?<eos> It's OK, hold on.<eos> It's OK, Frank.<eos> Did you really think we wouldn't recognise you?
Done with.<eos> We're doing it wrong.<eos> We have to do it differently...<eos> - That's what you say.<eos> - No, that's how it is. It is.<eos> - So what do you suggest?<eos> - I think we should call Mohammed.<eos> The guy knows what he's doing. - No.<eos> No! - Jo.<eos> - Sometimes I don't follow you.
I'm going to do it.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not stopping.<eos> I've got it in me.<eos> I'm good at it.<eos> I'm not giving up, I'm carrying on.<eos> You're the real thing?<eos> You're a big man.<eos> I feel sorry for you. Do you know that?<eos> I feel really sorry for you.
Give him to...<eos> Give me my baby, Frank.<eos> - Damn you!<eos> Sweetheart.<eos> Sweetheart?<eos> Go away, Frank.<eos> Go away.<eos> Go away and ruin everything.<eos> You retarded arsehole.<eos> Go away, I don't ever want to see you again.
What the hell was that?<eos> It's probably just a wedding somewhere nearby.<eos> They like to shoot off guns at weddings here.<eos> You get it, you're from Florida.<eos> Funny.<eos> When was the last time I saw you'?<eos> Since June?<eos> I'm sorry that I didn't get back last month.<eos> I can be in New York by Thursday.<eos> I miss you and I want to see you.
Goddamn it.<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> - Take it off.<eos> - I'm fucking trying to take it off!<eos> Oh, God, I'm gonna put it in you so fucking hard,<eos> -you're gonna fucking get it.<eos> - Don't talk.<eos> - I want everything in your mouth.<eos> -lain, just shut it.<eos> I'll take you lying down, come on.
- Two and a half, actually.<eos> I don't remember what happened last night.<eos> Kabulhappened, my wee froggy in the pot.<eos> Did I not wear a headscarf?<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> I believe I threw your mobile in my cupboard.<eos> Why?<eos> Because mid-coitus you tried to call Tanya about some bloody wild goose chase in the Tribals.<eos> I told you about that?<eos> Well, it was hard to understand you once you asked me to stuff your knickers in your mouth.
Ducky, I'm sorry.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> Did you go to the Tribals because you were in a contract negotiation?<eos> Dude, I'm not stealing your job, okay?<eos> Tanya, this is not about my fucking job.<eos> We have to make good calls, right?<eos> And now Andy lost an eye and Jaweed is dead.<eos> Christ, man, we've both fucking made mistakes!<eos> No.<eos> You would have done exactly what I did if Jaweed had gone to you.
Think.<eos> Observe.<eos> And plan.<eos> If you hit the rocks below you, you'll die from blunt force trauma.<eos> Or internal bleeding from massive bone fracturing.<eos> Or splenic flexure of the large intestine.<eos> Yes, thank you, Zaj.<eos> I can't, my hand.<eos> There's no cavalry.<eos> No one will magically appear and save you in the end.
They are not stopping us from saving Mom!<eos> Dad, abort the mission!<eos> Let's just go home!<eos> Abort the mission!<eos> We are rescuing Mom!<eos> Mom is dead, okay, Dad?<eos> She's dead!<eos> This is not what she would have wanted you to do!<eos> - They have no right!<eos> - I don't want to lose you!
Mom wanted to leave.<eos> I heard.<eos> Your mother and I made certain decisions, together, about what was best for all of you.<eos> I'm going to live here with Nana and Grandpa.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> Come on, get your stuff.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go!<eos> I hate you!<eos> I fucking hate you!
Come on, get your stuff.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go!<eos> I hate you!<eos> I fucking hate you!<eos> Rellian.<eos> Rellian.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> That almost hit me!<eos> If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
And you jump up and clap your hands.<eos> - Six.<eos> - Six.<eos> - Grandfather abuse.<eos> - Grandpa down!<eos> There's a lot in here, honey.<eos> I want you to take whatever you want.<eos> There's something I did want to show you.<eos> Just before you called about getting her treatment, she sent me two letters.<eos> And I wanted to show this one to you.
I think Jack's piece of cake is just way too big.<eos> Mom: I think you might be right. Ah, uh!<eos> Are you ready for bed, Jack? Mommy tucks me in.<eos> Tonight is one of the nights that daddy tucks you in, okay Jack?
Why are you sitting here?<eos> You feel okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, well, I got my eye on a few ladies.<eos> You wanna go, you wanna go talk to them?<eos> And do a little hunting, a little pussy hunting?<eos> - Jack:<eos> I'm okay. - Yeah!<eos> Go on ahead.<eos> I have a favor to ask from you though.
Let's just say I get it.<eos> So you can tell me, if you want, you know.<eos> I'm into some nasty shit,<eos> I'm sure you got a...<eos> We're related.<eos> You must have some weird stuff going on.<eos> Sexually.<eos> Hey, all right!<eos> Jack, honey...<eos> Mommy has to go. And I'm gonna take you over to your cousin's house, okay?
- Jack: What?<eos> - I have some bad news?<eos> Jack: What? Uh, we got like four more days of you turning into a werewolf, it turns out.<eos> Isn't it only supposed to last like one more night?<eos> Brandon: No, the moon only has to basically full for you to transform.<eos> And I'm looking at the lunar calendar, and it says that we've got four more nights of basically full moons.<eos> We're losing sun.<eos> This is... oh, fucking Christ.<eos> Okay, if the sun goes down,<eos> I'm dropping you in the woods.
All right, so just aim at like them flock of birds out in the distance there, no ammo, but just you know, get a sense of it.<eos> Poof!<eos> There you go, oh baby, you're so fucking good with a fucking shotgun, hmm!<eos> Jack, Jack?<eos> Open the fucking cage.<eos> Okay, one second.<eos> It's open.<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, sorry about that. That's nothing.<eos> Here you go, you should get in the car, it's warmed up for you.
Yeah.<eos> Well, this was fun.<eos> Let's chill some more, all right?<eos> Jack: Definitely.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, can I get my watch back by the way?<eos> - Jack: Oh I still need it.<eos> - Oh, why?<eos> All right, awesome.<eos> I'll set the watch for you.
Yeah?<eos> You do look a little off and I feel bad.<eos> All right, that's all right, how about tonight, you, me, and little Turner hang out.<eos> Hmm, what do you think?<eos> Hmmm... I mean I didn't drive over here for nothing, so.<eos> Oh, I know, oh I know,<eos> I'll make it worth your while, all right?<eos> Okay, but this is your last chance.<eos> Okay, so why don't you get ready?<eos> And I'll meet you upstairs in five minutes.
I am going to end you, motherfucker!<eos> Hmm, damn.<eos> All righty, let's do this.<eos> Turner?<eos> Well Jack, it seems you like to play games.<eos> Let's play one of my favorites.<eos> Now the rules are simple.<eos> My boys are gonna press pressure points on you.<eos> You are gonna scream.<eos> And then I'll give you this stress ball, you can squeeze it, hopefully it'll help calm you down.
Over there.<eos> Right there.<eos> Get out of the cage, Jack.<eos> Get out of the cage, Jack.<eos> Over there.<eos> Jack: Turner, you gotta put me back in the cage.<eos> No, no, no, time to confess, Jack.<eos> And you don't have much time.<eos> Turner, I gotta get back to that cage.<eos> Turner: One more step and I'll shoot you right now.

Shit.<eos> Do we keep rolling?<eos> I don't know. He can't just... Whoo!<eos> Fuck... me... sideways.<eos> That bad ass enough for you?<eos> Steve, have you met our special guest yet?<eos> This is Anna.<eos> It's always been her biggest dream to meet the great Steve Olson. In flesh, so to say.<eos> Branka?<eos> It's nice to meet you, kid.
Oh, my God. Branka, get up.<eos> Get up!<eos> What are we going to do now?<eos> We should continue going downhill.<eos> But we have no idea where this goes.<eos> This could be that dead-end valley.<eos> Rita showed it to us on a map.<eos> I've got matches.<eos> I could make a torch.<eos> You know, keeps you warm, keep away the creepy crawlies.
No, it's...<eos> - Let me see.<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> - Let me see.<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> Don't.<eos> I will put some schnapps on it for disinfection.<eos> I don't think schnapps is gonna do it.<eos> You know my cousin Arne, the zombie expert?<eos> Well, he would tell you that... you're only choice is to...

Previously on The Big Bang Theory...<eos> Dad, this is Sheldon's mother, Mary.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> And, of course, Mom.<eos> Hello, my hateful shrew. Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.<eos> Hey. Just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.<eos> I'm just afraid if I respond, then they'll know I got it.<eos> Dude, the minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it.<eos> I mean, they're probably looking at you through the camera right now.
And turned their phones off. Not helping, buddy.<eos> Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this.<eos> Please stay.<eos> Yeah, plus if you leave,<eos> Well, we can't have that.<eos> You know, also, if they did have coitus, we'll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.<eos> It is funny when you think about it.<eos> Maybe to you. You didn't get a $500 traffic ticket.<eos> Because you were driving like a lunatic.<eos> Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then... yeah, okay.
Hang on, hang on!<eos> We're smart, we can figure this out.<eos> Okay, so: Mary and Beverly can't be together.<eos> Uh, Alfred and Beverly can't be together.<eos> Leonard and I can't be together.<eos> Now, I could be with Alfred... but I don't like his face.<eos> Oh, here!<eos> I've got it! Who's ready for a wedding?<eos> Great, now I have to start all over.<eos> So how's the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?
Very nice, Wyatt.<eos> And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.<eos> You see what I've gotta put up with!<eos> What you've gotta put up with?<eos> Why did you have to go to jail?<eos> It's called getting caught, Mother!<eos> Hello!<eos> Hey, there he is!<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh, Leonard! It's so nice to see you again!
Hey, hey!<eos> She's mine! Take a cold shower, grandpa!<eos> Why wouldn't that colonel say what the meeting's about?<eos> It has to be bad news.<eos> Calm down, okay?<eos> Try not to think about it.<eos> That's really stupid advice.<eos> You know that hurts my feelings.<eos> Calm down, try not to think about it.<eos> Why do I bother talking to you?
And he can't wait to meet you, too.<eos> Can I get anyone a drink?<eos> Well, I could use another beer.<eos> You're done.<eos> He's done.<eos> Hey! Is everyone getting to know each other?<eos> Not at all!<eos> Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter.<eos> I'm, uh, Leonard's friend, Stuart.<eos> Nice to see you, too.
- What the hell?<eos> - Oh, my God, are you okay?<eos> - Are you guys drunk? - A little bit, yeah.<eos> Wanna join?<eos> No, what I want is to deliver this pizza and not hear from you guys.<eos> So, did you guys cook up this plan with Mosley to get me over here?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He texted saying he was sick right after he left here which means I'm stuck on deliveries and then all of a sudden, you order another pizza.<eos> No, we didn't order this pizza.<eos> Would I do that to you?
She seems a little upset, though.<eos> Trouble in paradise, Sam?<eos> Look, I don't know who the hell you are, but this has gone on long enough.<eos> - You need to stop this right now.<eos> - I'm afraid that's not an option.<eos> Yes, it is!<eos> All right, we're done with your bullshit!<eos> - You know, I'm hanging up for good.<eos> - Go ahead, but if you do be prepared to reap the consequences.<eos> Dude, I'm telling you, he's probably just some 400-pound nerd with too much computer equipment for his own good.
Why do that?<eos> Why?<eos> Son of a bitch, he's here.<eos> Mosley's either at the back door or upstairs.<eos> That was definitely upstairs.<eos> Brady... it's okay.<eos> I'll go.<eos> I knew you'd be the one to stay, Brady.<eos> Not quite the boy scout that Sam is, are you?<eos> But then again that's what I'm counting on because I have a deal for you.
No!<eos> Hey, come back!<eos> Okay.<eos> Please what can I do to make you let her go?<eos> - Tell me!<eos> - In order to save Peyton you'll need to give me something in return.<eos> I'll let her go if you kill Brady.<eos> A life for a life.<eos> I offered Brady the same chance to save himself and his parents.<eos> He tried to save you, instead.
Don't worry, she's perfectly safe.<eos> Yeah, well, let me talk to her, you asshole!<eos> I want proof.<eos> If you really want to see her, then you'll do what I asked.<eos> Come on, Sam.<eos> I can tell you want to.<eos> It must be very tempting.<eos> Punish him to save her.<eos> I'll gladly let Peyton go as soon as you give Brady what he deserves.<eos> Wouldn't that feel good right now, considering what he's done to you? Please, just...
- You'll find out soon enough when we're face-to-face.<eos> For now, you can call me Mr. Lee.<eos> No!<eos> Please, no, no, no!<eos> Brady.<eos> Brady, get up!<eos> Peyton's probably dead, too.<eos> I'll stay and cover your back.<eos> You go out the front get as far away from here as you can, and call for help.<eos> No, no, no, I'm not leaving you alone.
Brady, get up!<eos> Peyton's probably dead, too.<eos> I'll stay and cover your back.<eos> You go out the front get as far away from here as you can, and call for help.<eos> No, no, no, I'm not leaving you alone.<eos> Brothers for life, right?<eos> Now, I screwed up.<eos> Maybe this is my one chance to make it right.<eos> Go... get the fuck out of here.<eos> No, man, I'm not leaving you alone.
No one could find us.<eos> Everyone thought we were dead.<eos> And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?<eos> I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.<eos> I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless.<eos> Make me wanna get pregnant.<eos> And that's not the case?<eos> When I finish work every night, I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.<eos> When you woke up this morning, I went and I brought you back to bed with me.<eos> And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?
I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back.<eos> I'd just jerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor!<eos> Move!<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Move!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> You whore!<eos> Jesus Christ, Rachel.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?

Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night.<eos> You're lying.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you murder Megan Hipwell?<eos> Hi.<eos> I need to see you.
Nothing.<eos> Wake the fuck up, Rachel!<eos> Wake the fuck up!<eos> Wake up!<eos> You can sleep out here.<eos> We all felt so bad for you.<eos> He's such a bad guy.<eos> Ugh, God.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I need to see you.
Fuck off!<eos> Anna?<eos> No.<eos> Go away!<eos> Anna, please. Please.<eos> There's...<eos> Okay. Go!<eos> I'm gonna stand right here.<eos> I'm not gonna come closer.<eos> I just need to talk to you.
I'm not gonna come closer.<eos> I just need to talk to you.<eos> I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.<eos> Where's Tom?<eos> He's lying to you.<eos> He always does.<eos> He's a good liar.<eos> I know he's a good liar.<eos> We went behind your back for months.<eos> He's just done it to you.
Keep going straight. I'll tell you when to turn.<eos> You were in Dieppe for a while?<eos> A husband would offer his wife a cigarette before lighting his own.<eos> Turn right here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What went wrong in Paris? Your entire circuit was taken out.<eos> I never discuss non-relevant operational information with anyone.<eos> I'll try to stay relevant then.<eos> That would be appreciated.<eos> Do they trust you?

Two months ago, I got promoted to the Embassy Liaison Department.<eos> I deal with the German legation every day.<eos> But do they trust you?<eos> How did it look?<eos> They seemed to like you.<eos> And I like them.<eos> I keep the emotions real. That's why it works.<eos> Don't slow down.<eos> This is how you drive in Casablanca.<eos> Now that you're here I can show you off.
That wasn't so hard, was it?<eos> Now this is the part where I tell you I love you and leave you to count the stars, or whatever it is men do on their rooftops.<eos> Now kiss me again.<eos> You can come in now.<eos> You are somewhat formal and reserved.<eos> But you like expensive clothes. And your shoes are always polished.<eos> I told everyone you're quite a serious Catholic.<eos> At least you can smell like a Parisian.<eos> I'll leave you to choose.<eos> Before I left London, Guy Sangster asked me to say thank you.
I didn't see you set the travel safety.<eos> You'll be okay to use a Sten on the night, though?<eos> I would be okay if I had to use cutlery.<eos> The diversion attack will happen five minutes later at 8:35.<eos> And then everything will be in God's hands.<eos> Good.<eos> Hopefully, he'll know how to work the safety.<eos> It's hot.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Testing you the way you tested me.
For what?<eos> Your first weekend off in 57 days.<eos> I counted.<eos> - Are the eggs from the hens?<eos> So they were a good investment.<eos> Weren't they?<eos> Max, let's go to the heath and pick mushrooms.<eos> Tomorrow I want to serve stroganoff at the party.<eos> What party?<eos> Darling, I've got lots of new friends who are dying to meet you.
- Good afternoon, sir. - Afternoon.<eos> George is in your office.<eos> I thought you said to meet you in the mess.<eos> I lied.<eos> It isn't me you're here to see.<eos> - Do you...<eos> No, V Section want to speak to you.<eos> Well, why didn't they call me?<eos> Because V Section, they never say what they mean and they never mean what they say. And they never say anything on the phone.<eos> I told you they'd come for you eventually, didn't I, Max?
You two, outside. Outside.<eos> My people are behaving so badly.<eos> I thought they would eat something, not just drink and have sex.<eos> Half of them I don't even know. I think word spread around Hampstead.<eos> Would you go check no one is actually fucking in Anna's room?<eos> Sure.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Listen. I've been briefed that you're operational, but I haven't been told why you're operational.<eos> Now, look, I thought as a friend I ought to just give you a word of warning.<eos> If the job V Section are offering you is the one everyone's talking about... Max, if they want you to run the resistance in France on D-Day, you should know they wouldn't just call you in for a job interview. They would test you somehow.
Get these bloody lights off!<eos> They're targeting the East End again.<eos> We should be all right here.<eos> Max, no more.<eos> Please?<eos> By Monday morning, we'll... We'll know for sure.<eos> Try and get some rest.<eos> - Frank?<eos> - It's not a game.<eos> Even if it is, V Section wouldn't tell you.

I'm sorry.<eos> I need to know, is this real?<eos> Do you love me?<eos> I love you. I love you.<eos> I've loved you since Casablanca.<eos> Okay, listen to me.<eos> This is how it will be.<eos> There is a Medicine Hat in Switzerland or Peru or wherever the hell.<eos> We won't make it.<eos> If we stay one more hour, V Section's gonna order me to kill you.
Are we really doing this right now?<eos> What did I tell you about the people in the house?<eos> We pay them to live here.<eos> To be normal fucking people, like I did with you.<eos> What's in the house?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Good girl.<eos> Good.<eos> And you didn't know what was in your house, right?<eos> The problem is, not many people believe you.
What?<eos> Why don't you go outside and play?<eos> You really should have that looked at, Dennis.<eos> I can't stay much longer.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Oregon.<eos> No, I don't have to go to Oregon, I just have to go somewhere.<eos> You pregnant?<eos> That's so medieval.<eos> But I don't wanna say too much 'cause it'd put you in a bad position.
For 30 years, i was drinking and drugging and fighting like everybody had it in for me.<eos> Your higher power can't do shit for me here, dad.<eos> When I called you, you said that you had money.<eos> Now, I'm not criticizing.<eos> I'm just saying, it kind of looks like you miss the comforts of jail.<eos> I can get you money, if that's what you want, kid.<eos> But let me make a deal.<eos> Give me a week.<eos> One week, you stay clean.<eos> You got people looking for you, who's gonna find you out here?
God damn it!<eos> You still got all your teeth.<eos> How long you been doin' this?<eos> A month?<eos> You telling me the truth?<eos> Yes, that's the truth.<eos> And it's Hank Williams.<eos> That's what I was playing for you. What the fuck?<eos> Hank Williams.<eos> That's what I was playing for you before.
You maybe talking to the feds, or something?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm not talking to anybody but you.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You never stop, but you don't say anything.<eos> See, that was supposed to be an easy hit.<eos> Take you out in the desert, rape ya, put a bullet in your brain, have a bologna sandwich.<eos> Make a real day of it.<eos> What do they want from you?
Oh.<eos> I understand.<eos> You don't wanna spoil the good impression you made so far.<eos> It's not that funny.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> I'm gonna pee in my pants, dad.<eos> You good?<eos> You all done?<eos> All wrung out? Finished?<eos> What's wrong with you?
You good?<eos> You all done?<eos> All wrung out? Finished?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> It's time to cut the shit.<eos> What the fuck was so wrong at your mother's, that you had to run away with those guys?<eos> No, god!<eos> I left home a while ago.<eos> I didn't even know those guys.<eos> They sure seemed to know you.
What do you mean by that?<eos> What, you organizing a fucking union?<eos> What do you have against them?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Well, okay.<eos> Okay, well, they come up here, they're illegal and they take my job.<eos> Ah. So, you pick oranges for a living?<eos> Nope, but I'm sure someone does.<eos> Nope, not true.<eos> In fact, I bet you that no white person has ever picked a piece of fruit off of a tree, ever.
This fucking kid's a carnival, man.<eos> She's every loser's lucky day.<eos> Look, I'm goin' to preacher's.<eos> I'm heading there.<eos> John,I feltlike youwerethefirst personI reallyhelped.<eos> That'sthegod's honesttruth.<eos> Look, I'm not dying, kirb.<eos> I'm just in El centro.<eos> Look,tellme whereyouare, givemean address, I'mgonnacomeget you .<eos> I'll call you back, okay?
You don't think i could take care of myself?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> Not even in this dump here, let alone in Guadalajara or some other turd factory down south.<eos> Within a week, you'll be turning tricks.<eos> That is the most insulting thing that anybody has ever said to me.<eos> Well, I bet it's not.<eos> How else are you gonna make money?<eos> Look, look, kid. I'm just...<eos> I'm just trying to help you think straight, all right?<eos> I know what it's like to have the shit come down on you, okay?
You know what?<eos> You grew up with your mama.<eos> You never knew the world your daddy rode in.<eos> But your mama wasn't always rich.<eos> She started out with us.<eos> But she married up the ladder.<eos> She became a hood ornament for the best cars.<eos> How long you been away from home?<eos> I know all about why little rich girls leave their pretty things behind.<eos> When a mosquito bites you, it leaves an enzyme that other mosquitos can smell.
But the worst and, I mean, the worst goddamn people in the world know that scent and they'll follow it.<eos> Can you dig it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry to leave you out there with them animals, but I was keepin' an eye on ya.<eos> So, is this the old hog?<eos> This is her.<eos> '97 softail with a 570 lift cam. Shaved the fenders, chromed the front and dropped her two inches.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Hmm. I feel kind of jealous, I thought i was an only child.<eos> Do you think he's gonna give it back to you?
You gotta be shittin' me.<eos> No, I'm not shittin' ya.<eos> Things have changed, hombre.<eos> I can't let an opportunity like this slide by.<eos> See a nickel on the ground these days, you pick it up.<eos> For 30 grand. Yeah, well, 30 g's will fill a lot of holes around here, compadre.<eos> I do appreciate your loyalty in the past.<eos> I really do.<eos> But we gotta be professional about this.<eos> We're not gonna turn you in.
You know what I'm looking for.<eos> Where's my keys?<eos> See what we got here. What're you doin'?<eos> Stealing from me, link?<eos> Stealing?<eos> You stole every goddamn thing I ever had.<eos> Everything!<eos> Now look at you.<eos> You're so fucking broke and pathetic,<eos> I can't even kill you for it.
Fine. You kill yourself, then I'll kill myself.<eos> I'll take some innocent people with me.<eos> How'd that be? You think I'm kidding, dad, but I've tried.<eos> Yeah, so have I, plenty of times.<eos> Where does that get us?<eos> I took all of my stepdad's pills when I was 12.<eos> Girls take pills when they want somebody to find 'em.<eos> I tried to hang myself when I was 10-years-old.<eos> Well, that didn't work very well.<eos> Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?
Did he call you?<eos> Yeah,earlier,he did.<eos> Hetoldme youwerein yuma.<eos> Listen,I 'mworriedabouthim , I'mworriedaboutbothofyou.<eos> Is he in trouble?<eos> Idon'tthink it'ssafeforyou tobetherealone.<eos> Ithinkyoushouldgo toa publicplace, someplacecrowded.<eos> Don'ttrustanybody,Lydia.<eos> Stayinacrowd. Listentoyourinstincts.<eos> I have to pull strings to get you back inside?
I gave you everything you needed.<eos> I took better care of you than anybody in your life.<eos> And you tried to kill me.<eos> Look, come...<eos> This is still bleeding.<eos> Come here.<eos> No.<eos> I have your name on my heart and you can't even come close to me?<eos> Where is he?<eos> You try to run, and we're gonna have to kill you.
Make a big fucking show to prove it's not you.<eos> Lydia told me about the houses, she told me everything.<eos> AndI gotalinestraightto yourunclein fuckingjuarez.<eos> El padrino, youknowhim.<eos> I know he doesn't think too much of you.<eos> You're still on the phone because you know this is real.<eos> Andyouknowhe's alreadywatchingyou.<eos> You think he's letting you use one of his best sicarios, that zapotecan monster with you?<eos> Just for you?<eos> He's there to keep track of you, too, motherfuck!

Motherfucker's up there!<eos> Where is he?<eos> You're hit.<eos> Did you see him?<eos> No. Okay.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Okay, I saw him that time!<eos> Okay, I got an idea.<eos> I'll lay down some cover fire, you run to the other car.<eos> He won't be able to track you there, okay?
Where is he?<eos> You're hit.<eos> Did you see him?<eos> No. Okay.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Okay, I saw him that time!<eos> Okay, I got an idea.<eos> I'll lay down some cover fire, you run to the other car.<eos> He won't be able to track you there, okay?<eos> What? He'll be takin' shots at me, he won't even see you.
One!<eos> No! Two...<eos> No!<eos> Count to a million if you want to!<eos> If you think that I'm leaving here without you, then you don't know me!<eos> All this time, and you never even fucking knew me!<eos> What?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's nice to meet you.
- And you'll figure it out?<eos> - Of course.<eos> That's what we're here for.<eos> Take it off so I can hear better.<eos> Take your glasses off.<eos> You're white, haven't been to the beach?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - It's cold.<eos> Now, then... take a deep breath.<eos> When I tell you, when I touch you with it.
That's 314, Soriano's box, that politician's box.<eos> What do you know about it?<eos> And what the hell do you know?<eos> What the fuck's going on here?<eos> You knew about the box before we came in.<eos> So did you.<eos> Are you fucking me over?<eos> Am I fucking you over?<eos> Who contacted you?<eos> Are they paying you to watch me?
What's wrong with you?<eos> So you already sold it.<eos> Don't insult my intelligence.<eos> - You sold it. - Don't play dumb with me.<eos> Where were you?<eos> My old man said you were crap.<eos> It's flooded!<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Don't give me shit like your dad, just grab the bags.<eos> Who told you?
- You sold it. - Don't play dumb with me.<eos> Where were you?<eos> My old man said you were crap.<eos> It's flooded!<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Don't give me shit like your dad, just grab the bags.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Did you talk to Juan?<eos> Who was it?<eos> Who told you, you fuck?
My old man said you were crap.<eos> It's flooded!<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Don't give me shit like your dad, just grab the bags.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Did you talk to Juan?<eos> Who was it?<eos> Who told you, you fuck?<eos> The manager.<eos> She told you, just like that.
- Yeah. - The brunette.<eos> What is she out of a 10?<eos> - Have you got shit for brains?<eos> - Why? Don't you see our situation here?<eos> And you talk about chicks? Just as we came in those fuckers were about to take everything from her.<eos> - This is no coincidence.<eos> - Are you listening to yourself?<eos> She's into me.<eos> I feel a vibe, an energy, like a sign, right?<eos> Signs and vibes... She's not even looking at you.
How about we talk face to face?<eos> So you can shoot me down?<eos> No one's shooting anyone, you have my word of honor.<eos> In 5 minutes at the front door.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Listen to me closely, Uruguayan.<eos> We're getting you out of there.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> I've been waiting to hear that for hours, sir.<eos> I don't know what you were thinking, but you've clearly failed, so you have to do exactly as I tell you.
Soriano conned everyone, including us.<eos> When the Russians took Berlin at the end of World War II,<eos> two soldiers entered the bunker and found the ashes of Hitler and Eva Braun's bones.<eos> What are you talking about? Are you wasted?<eos> The soldiers were sent back to Moscow and all their bones were broken.<eos> They wanted to be sure the soldiers didn't invent the suicide story.<eos> Then, just in case, they sent them to Siberia.<eos> They never believed there were only ashes left.<eos> Sometimes the truth's a bitch.<eos> I'm like those Russians, the people outside will think an accomplice at the bank is hiding it for you.
You will.<eos> Go north, only north.<eos> Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black.<eos> He'll help you.<eos> Where is Lady Bolton?<eos> - Dead.<eos> - Liar.<eos> She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts.<eos> I left her to die in the snow.<eos> I can't wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.
Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing.<eos> Oberyn Martell butchered, and you did nothing.<eos> You're not a Dornishman.<eos> You're not our prince.<eos> My son Trystane...<eos> Your son is weak just like you.<eos> And weak men will never rule Dorne again.<eos> I told you I'm not hungry.<eos> We're not here to feed you.<eos> We're here to kill you.
So I take it the info I put in Mrs. Takiff's file worked?<eos> Mrs. Takiff would have lost everything if we wouldn't have helped her.<eos> I already starting fixing this new Benson vs. Flynn file.<eos> I was thinking, one of these days, you may actually win a case without cheating.<eos> It's not cheating... not if the good guy wins.<eos> So you're the good guy.<eos> How are you doing? - Hi.<eos> I'm great. How are you?<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you.
- Oh, intrigued, okay.<eos> - I was curious.<eos> That's all. - Okay.<eos> So how is it being married?<eos> It's complicated. "I do.<eos> You do." Seems pretty self-explanatory to me.<eos> Well, that's the easy part. And then there's...<eos> It's just complicated.<eos> Well, I'm dating a guy who's completely not right for me, and he wants to get serious, and I don't.<eos> And I came here tonight to see you...
Oh, my God.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Don't you want to fuck me?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> Ben.<eos> Take the fire escape.<eos> Don't let my neighbor stop you. She'll talk you to death.
We need to get back to normal, all right?<eos> - I'll join you upstairs.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Give us a minute.<eos> The information against Arthur Denning you gave me, is it legit?<eos> Because if you're wrong, you'll be doing document review for the rest of your career.<eos> Abrams' office, five minutes. Brief him on what you have.<eos> Keep it short.<eos> Do not fuck up.<eos> Senior partner just threatened you.
I was just getting cozy with your wife.<eos> Yes, she said that she recognized me from your profile picture.<eos> - Isn't that crazy?<eos> - Yeah, it's crazy.<eos> Emily said that you guys met freshman year at Tennessee? - Yeah. - We dated, actually.<eos> But I think Ben got over me since then.<eos> - So are you here by yourself?<eos> - No, girls' night out.<eos> You know, drinking and dancing and... speaking of which, I should probably go find them.<eos> Well, it was nice to see you.
Just shed it. You understand?<eos> We're gonna have to attack this motherfucker... clip his claws.<eos> Take his head, and chop that fucking thing off.<eos> We'll put it on the wall. A trophy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now we're talking. - All right. All right.<eos> Call me anytime.<eos> And Anthony... forget the cream soda once again? See that?<eos> I knew you did.<eos> You shed whatever's distracting you, you'll be okay. Good seeing you, son.
The kidnappers weren't there.<eos> If they were, they had no intention of approaching me, and time is precious.<eos> I don't think these guys would waste it, do you?<eos> And... it could have been a ruse or a trick. I don't know, but... as always, in matters like this, I'll take things into my own hands.<eos> My actions may appear somewhat rash or foolish, but I did what I believed was right.<eos> So this now is the situation we find ourselves in.<eos> I want Emily back, and I want her back, now.<eos> So how are we going to accomplish this, Joe?<eos> Can you enlighten me?<eos> No, Giffords, I can't tell you why.
You didn't do it, right?<eos> No, I didn't do it.<eos> I gotta ask the question, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> - I told you not to get involved with her. - You knew Emily was crazy.<eos> - I know! I know!<eos> I should have listened to you.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> If the cops catch you with this, they're gonna shoot first, ask questions later.
This is the Bronx of the Arabs, boy.<eos> Only the street-smart can act smart here.<eos> Not cops.<eos> In the desperation to find Viraj..<eos> ..don't end up losing yourself.<eos> Take care.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> My apologies, son.<eos> This is the problem with chicks.<eos> Trust them.. ..and they'll surely cheat on you. What?
I didn't understand one thing.<eos> Are you the informer or him?<eos> - Kabir..<eos> - Found your man.<eos> Cheers! - Who is he?<eos> - Sameer Ghazi.<eos> The biggest party animal of this city.<eos> The girls here.. ..are very fond of him.<eos> But.. ..he's not interested.<eos> "I wanna see you on the dance floor."
You want something?<eos> Protein shake, energy bar..<eos> It's all there for you.<eos> Because you have to slog hard for the finals.<eos> You just have to play 25 overs.<eos> But while you're at the crease..<eos> ..the run rate has to be below five..<eos> ..and get two of the top batsmen in your team dismissed by run outs.<eos> Viraj, your image is so clean that nobody would even doubt it.<eos> Though the people worship you.. ..you just need to act human for this one game.
Whenever I tried to fall in love with you.. ..you hiked up your rates.<eos> 25 before the match and 25 after the match.<eos> I just shook your hand.. ..but you turned it into a hug.<eos> Done.<eos> What's the guarantee that you'll pay?<eos> Buddy, the only thing that's respected in my business.. ..is one's word.<eos> Once given, I'll not turn back.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Atleast, open my eyes now.<eos> I want to see you.
Good boy!<eos> It's not play-time, dear.<eos> Shit!<eos> He saw it.<eos> He's kept Viraj right opposite the team's hotel.<eos> Because nobody looks for lost things at home.<eos> Bradman, you turned out to be Sherlock!<eos> Don't come near me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> For the past 36 hours, we've been looking for you all over town.
You too.<eos> But don't keep redialling if I reject the call.<eos> Look, there comes the 'Smart Alec' of our department.<eos> Kabir, one last job for you. We're deporting her to India.<eos> Can't you ever bring good news, Mr. Saeed?<eos> You.. come and collect your badge and gun tomorrow.<eos> Difficult tomorrow, I'll come the day after.<eos> These big cases exhaust me.<eos> Thank you for everything, Saeed.<eos> I hope never to meet you again.
I look equally bad on video too, uncle.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Muskaan.<eos> My entire family saw your photo.<eos> And nobody liked me?<eos> Except me.<eos> - Can we meet?<eos> - Why?<eos> Just like that. I wanted to know you better.
Yeah!<eos> Stupid bitch problems go in room 102, ladies.<eos> What the hell? What do you want, Toby?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Dr. horvath's Percocet, yoga Emily's dexedrine... Or my dad's sublimaze?<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> One minute.<eos> So, boys, what do all these make me feel?<eos> The pills?<eos> The perco is gonna numb you and then lift you.
I told you not to leave.<eos> I locked the door behind me.<eos> I just wanted to see the new family.<eos> Stop playing around.<eos> Get rid of them.<eos> Logan.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Sick fucks!<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> You're-- don't worry about me, go get your brother.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Miles!<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> I'm in here!<eos> Miles. The big guy locked me in here...<eos> But I think they have Kim in the next room.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
Hey, hey, hey!<eos> I'm in here!<eos> Miles. The big guy locked me in here...<eos> But I think they have Kim in the next room.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?<eos> Jessie, just be careful!<eos> Kim?<eos> No, shit, shit.<eos> What?<eos> We're as surprised as you.
Break my heart?<eos> You want me, right?<eos> I can be family.<eos> My friends, they can-- they can just go home.<eos> And you can let Kim go, right?<eos> Because you have me now.<eos> I would feel so much more comfortable... Without these straps on.<eos> Oh, thank you so much.<eos> I, um, I could do so much more with both my hands free.<eos> Oh, my god, I thought I'd never see you again!
Daddy!<eos> How are you okay?<eos> Don't stop! Come on, come on!<eos> Go faster!<eos> I'm trying, miles!<eos> Go faster, Jessie!<eos> Just-- just run!<eos> Just go get help!<eos> You were supposed to be family!<eos> I was trying to save you from those people you hate!
You're immune to the pain of the people who are dying because you have an investment in their being willing to die.<eos> You say, "I will build a statue.<eos> I will remember you in a history book."<eos> But if you look at that from another perspective, that building of the statue or remembering you in a history book is a bribe to be willing to die so that I can live.<eos> Both sexes in the area where they are rejected tend to turn what rejects them into an object.<eos> So the area where men...<eos> I'm watching this, um, lecture that Warren Farrell's gmng in the '90s.<eos> I see some women in the crowd, and a lot of them have their hands folded, and there is a little bit of...<eos> Uncomfortableness...<eos> By being a woman in a crowd of people while the speaker's talking about how men are oppressed and women have it so great. It kinda puts you on the defensive, as a woman.
In every society that's ever existed, women have had privilege and protection that men did not.<eos> For example, we never hear about how men were excluded from the forced labor convention of 1930.<eos> For years, the forced labor convention was an international treaty that banned slavery, enforced servitude, but it made an exception for able-bodied males ages 18 to 45.<eos> Eventually, they got rid of that, but there was still an exemption for prisoners and military, which is 90% male.<eos> Stop pretending that you're oppressed and men are your oppressors. It's a lie, and it's a hurtful lie, and it's a hateful lie, and it's wrong.<eos> You talk a lot about the red pill in a voice for men.<eos> What is the red pill?<eos> Oh, it's sort of a cultural slogan. It comes from the movie "the matrix"<eos> where the character Neo is given the choice between a red pill and a blue pill.<eos> You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Under-grad Gerald Ashborne.<eos> Chinese heroin. Number three variety.<eos> New for these parts and rather worrying.<eos> How's that? This Chinese stuff varies in strength enormously.<eos> Results are somewhat hit... and in the case of the late Gerald Ashborne, a rather resounding miss.<eos> Right.<eos> Thank you, doctor.<eos> Evening, officer.<eos> Hello, matey.<eos> Last place I'd expected to see you.
- Yes.<eos> - Before, I found a letter.<eos> - Don't. Please.<eos> "By the time you read this, I'll be gone.<eos> "Don't come after me.<eos> You're my heart, Charlie Greel, "but every time I look at you, "I've got to put it behind me and start again.<eos> We let the stars go.<eos> Kathy."<eos> You're Kathy and Bixby was Charlie.<eos> "Every time I look at you." What?
But as soon as Conrad removed his spectacles, no-one could tell them apart. Certainly not the audience.<eos> The illusion depended on everyone believing there was only one boy. An illusion you maintained amongst the other show folk.<eos> A magician keeps his secrets, even unto the grave.<eos> - Isn't that what you told us?<eos> He existed only for those few moments on stage.<eos> The rest of the time, he lived in shadow.<eos> What that might do a young soul, I don't like to think.<eos> Then Kay, or Kathy, joined the act.<eos> You fell for Charlie and Charlie fell for you, too. But Conrad wanted you also.<eos> "You're my heart, Charlie Greel, but every time I look at you..."
Thoughts hurried 'n disordered.<eos> He felt as though the light were re proach, and shrunk involuntarily from the day<eos> As if you were some foul and hideous thing...<eos> Help me!<eos> No, help!<eos> Help me!<eos> Help!<eos> You did that!<eos> There you has me right.<eos> I told you. I didn't dream, so it was much scarier than it needed to be.
Help!<eos> You did that!<eos> There you has me right.<eos> I told you. I didn't dream, so it was much scarier than it needed to be.<eos> Needs must.<eos> Titchy little snapper whippers like you should not be higgling around with old sage and onions like me.<eos> Giants is all murdererful and cannibals.<eos> They's swallowpin' up human beans like they's sugar lumps.<eos> Beings, not beans.<eos> Well, they'd eat you either way.
Frolic, you know..<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> Sorry. Don't just take it.<eos> Do something.<eos> Gizzard Gulper, go long.<eos> Why you not hunt with us, Runt?<eos> Look at the puffers!<eos> Rain be comin'.<eos> Bean.<eos> You shouldn't let them treat you like that.
Boggswinkles!<eos> It's a fizzwizard.<eos> I don't be seein' many of them anymore.<eos> It's behind you on your elbow.<eos> No!<eos> Now it's on your foot.<eos> The other foot.<eos> It's on your bottom!<eos> I's got it.<eos> It seems to know you, gal.
You have a plan.<eos> You need me.<eos> Yes. We do.<eos> Should we call for him now?<eos> I suppose we should.<eos> You promise you won't hurt him, ma'am?<eos> Rear garden, rear garden please.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> BFG.<eos> BFG, the queen would really like to meet you.
No.<eos> I'm a soldier.<eos> And why you a soldier?<eos> Because... I had no reason to stay.<eos> I had no one any more.<eos> Why no one any more?<eos> You still want radio?<eos> Become free man.<eos> You have to move on.<eos> - Even wrong path can take you home.
- No, you're not.<eos> Because you're gonna go back to Jenny.<eos> Because Jenny loves you for who you are.<eos> She's waiting for you. That's the reason you need to stay alive.<eos> Watch out.<eos> - I don't have enough ammo to kill 'em!<eos> - We'll try the maneuver. - What maneuver?<eos> - The damn Shuman maneuver!<eos> You gotta be kidding, that won't work!<eos> If all the dogs attack you at once, they'll knock you over and that mine explodes.
Don't you leave me too.<eos> I got problems.<eos> The guys at work. Don't think they like me.<eos> I don't know, maybe just try and relax.<eos> Just tell me if you call this respect?<eos> I'm sorry, I was just trying to explain the situation.<eos> Just tell me, Rose, do you call this respect?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't show it, Rose.<eos> I respect you, Bob.
You know that.<eos> Just don't do that, OK?<eos> You're gonna wake Mike.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't care who I wake, you hear me?<eos> In my house.<eos> And I deserve respect from you, Rose!<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> I understand.<eos> I respect you, Bob.
Just don't do that, OK?<eos> You're gonna wake Mike.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't care who I wake, you hear me?<eos> In my house.<eos> And I deserve respect from you, Rose!<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> I understand.<eos> I respect you, Bob.<eos> You know that, I respect you.
Please.<eos> I don't care who I wake, you hear me?<eos> In my house.<eos> And I deserve respect from you, Rose!<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> I understand.<eos> I respect you, Bob.<eos> You know that, I respect you.<eos> It's like a war out there, you know?<eos> Trying to get money to put food on the table for you!
It's up my ass. Do you wanna go see it?<eos> It's in the den.<eos> I hit your car, Bob.<eos> - Again?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Is it bad?<eos> We should take my car.<eos> You had a nice swim, honey?<eos> My eyes hurt.<eos> I told you, Bob.
Oh, don't look at me. I fucking hate murder.<eos> - Don't I, Terry?<eos> - He hates murder.<eos> Oh, I hate murder!<eos> It really upsets me.<eos> But more importantly, where's the loot?<eos> Stashed it.<eos> How much you want? - All of it.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> - Fuck you! - No, fuck you, glass-jaw boy.
He lives... He lives in town.<eos> - Where in town?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't know!<eos> I swear to God!<eos> Give me back my fucking wig.<eos> Give me back my fucking wig!<eos> - Put the wig on, put the wig on.<eos> - Sorry, man, I didn't...<eos> I didn't mean to upset you like that, man.
Every now and again.<eos> You gonna order a drink or what?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna order a drink.<eos> I want a Bloody Mary.<eos> The bloodier the better.<eos> You got it.<eos> Are you fucking serious?<eos> I'm sorry, you can't come in here looking like that.<eos> - For fuck's sake. - You can't come in here wearing... See the fucking man over there?<eos> He's a fucking policeman, he'll kick the shit out of you.
No, we can't drink while we're on duty because that would be illegal.<eos> Is everything all right, sir?<eos> Yes, it's fine. I'd like the bill, please.<eos> - Oh, that's fantastic.<eos> - That's good.<eos> Hey, Bob. Did I ever tell you about that time I puked Indian food through my nose?<eos> - No! - Gentlemen, is this a social visit or do you have a particular reason for embarrassing me?<eos> We're not trying to embarrass you.<eos> Are we, Terry?<eos> - Why would we? - We just came here to say that we know everything about you and we're onto you.
We can talk about it another time.<eos> Okay...<eos> Could I actually call you in a few minutes?<eos> I'm going through a little bit of a thing here at work<eos> - and...<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> How did you even get in here?<eos> - I thought you needed a card to...<eos> Your dad called me, and, he wanted me to tell you...
- Do you think they pay for their own labor?<eos> No, has to be donated.<eos> - Let's watch The Brothers.<eos> - No.<eos> Just knock it down and start again.<eos> - Hey, Mom. - My goodness.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Don!<eos> - How you doing, Dad?<eos> - It's great to see you, son.
- He's at the window.<eos> - My God, mine doesn't work.<eos> - What?<eos> - Mine doesn't work.<eos> - Don't grab...<eos> Put it down.<eos> - My seat doesn't work. My seat... He's coming.<eos> He's coming. He's coming over?<eos> - Is he coming over?<eos> - My God, Ron. I'm going to kill you.
- My God, mine doesn't work.<eos> - What?<eos> - Mine doesn't work.<eos> - Don't grab...<eos> Put it down.<eos> - My seat doesn't work. My seat... He's coming.<eos> He's coming. He's coming over?<eos> - Is he coming over?<eos> - My God, Ron. I'm going to kill you.<eos> I'm going to kill you.
Dad brought us here instead.<eos> You can't take our kids out of school without calling me, Ron.<eos> Grandma has a tumor.<eos> It's the size of a basketball in her head.<eos> It's only a softball, actually.<eos> Sally...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Thank you, Stacey.<eos> What is he doing here?<eos> Can I talk to you for a second? Alone?
Right. Okay. Sure.<eos> - You don't have any money, right?<eos> - Jason.<eos> Okay.<eos> John! My God!<eos> I haven't heard from you in, like, two days!<eos> I've been worried!<eos> Rebecca, I just saw Gwen.<eos> I went over to her house for dinner, her and her husband, he was there.<eos> And okay, honey, I'll just tell you, she kissed me!
Rebecca, what I'm trying to tell you is... I love you.<eos> I love you, and I don't know, I just wanted you to know that.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Dad?<eos> Hey, Johnny, what's going on?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - John?<eos> - I'm working.<eos> John?<eos> Rebecca, I have to call you back.
John.<eos> - John.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Is this a dream?<eos> - No.<eos> Why is he wearing my mother's robe?<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Ron, John's brother.<eos> - It is so good to finally meet you.
I'm looking for Eve.<eos> Well, I'm the very last person who could help you find my daughter.<eos> Selene, listen to me.<eos> The Lycans are moving again.<eos> No, this is different.<eos> They're organized.<eos> They have a new leader. - His name is Marius.<eos> - I'm finished with this war.<eos> Well, it's not finished with you.<eos> They could have killed you... but clearly their mission was to capture you.
Pains me to admit it, but for the first time in my life... I genuinely fear for our future.<eos> So, what is your plan?<eos> Semira, you always have a plan.<eos> This little mise-en-scene you're performing has a purpose.<eos> I am not a mind reader.<eos> Kindly do an old vampire the courtesy... of telling him why he's been invited here.<eos> Selene.<eos> Come on. We need to keep moving.<eos> There are safe houses far closer than this.<eos> I told you, they destroyed them.
Do you believe her?<eos> Do you believe her?<eos> I put a tracer in her companion.<eos> Well... that means you're not completely incompetent.<eos> Try and stay still.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's some sort of bullet.<eos> It's burrowing through you faster than you can heal.<eos> It's self-propelled.<eos> That's what I was trying to tell you.
Try and stay still.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's some sort of bullet.<eos> It's burrowing through you faster than you can heal.<eos> It's self-propelled.<eos> That's what I was trying to tell you.<eos> These Lycans are sophisticated.<eos> I don't know if I can remove it in time.<eos> Well, the least you can do is attempt to sound reassuring.<eos> I'm going to attempt not to kill you.
She would be invaluable in our fight against Marius... perhaps even the pivotal element to secure our victory.<eos> If she can be found... and sets foot within this precious coven... I will hold you, Semira, personally responsible... - for controlling her.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Intruder. Intruder.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Drop it.<eos> How'd you find us?<eos> There are only a handful of safe houses left.<eos> The Lycans made it rather easy.<eos> The council of the Eastern Coven sent me to bring you in.
Don't try and fabricate some kind of martyrdom for her.<eos> I prefer a more honest appraisal of her decision.<eos> She abandoned her only son for the sake of her precious council.<eos> - Take it.<eos> Amelia asked me to give him this.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Nothing. I just need to be left alone.<eos> Yes, I know the feeling.<eos> Why didn't my father tell me about my mother?<eos> I did not know your father well... but I know that his greatest fear was to lose you.
What happened?<eos> Well, she was either shot to death or smothered with a pillow.<eos> I won't know for sure till I take her back to the lab and cut her open.<eos> Hello. Could someone please help me up?<eos> Is that man all right?<eos> Get it out, rookie.<eos> You'll get used to it... Unfortunately.<eos> Tanner, Hoffman.<eos> Tribeca.<eos> Lieutenant wants to see you.
Hey, I get it.<eos> Listen, if you're not doing anything, I... I thought maybe we could grab a beer or something.<eos> I mean, you do drink beer, don't you?<eos> I don't drink beer.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> So, does this mean we're, uh, partners now?<eos> Yeah. Why not?<eos> Partners.<eos> Yo! Tribeca!<eos> Lieutenant wants to see you.
Close your eyes go to sleep<eos> Sleep<eos> Oh, my baby<eos> Were you sleeping?<eos> I wonder what worlds you've travelled<eos> - Are you Rama?<eos> - Yes, but not the God<eos> Come and lie down<eos> Come closer<eos> Do you know? I've come to meet you from really far away
Listen to me, we can find out how fast passenger trains went back then.<eos> We take that speed, multiply by the hours that you were on the train.<eos> That's it!<eos> We create a search radius.<eos> And inside there, you will find the station with the rain tank.<eos> Yeah, but it will take a lifetime to search all the stations in India.<eos> Did I say all the stations?<eos> Ok, even half the stations..<eos> Really guys, I don't want to talk about this.<eos> Did your parents try to find you?
And my cousin.<eos> And, um, like my Butler sometimes.<eos> That's dawg with a "w-g" motherfucker. Ah.<eos> Suck my dick, you bowtie-wearing piece of shit!<eos> Nice work, dick dawg, write yourself a check.<eos> Fuck yeah!<eos> You're wearing one too.<eos> You put this on me.<eos> Yeah and he'll do it again, if I tell him to!<eos> I could dress you in bow ties for the next thirty years if I want.
It's so great to see you, thanks for coming by here!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Sammy!<eos> You know you used to call me mascot, or houseboy!<eos> I wore the goat suit! I'd go, "go team, go." I was out there.<eos> There was someone in that thing?<eos> Hey, back off.<eos> Oh, no, it's okay I'm just talking to my friend.<eos> Oh, your friend?<eos> I don't think he knows you man.
One more, please.<eos> Coming right up.<eos> I think you're amazing.<eos> I mean, with everything that you've been through, the lawsuits, and losing Thad castle and Craig Shilo and Radon Randell and still winning.<eos> We should be building your statue, not bitching about your age.<eos> Would you like to take a ride on my motorcycle?<eos> Oh, fuck me!<eos> Alex!<eos> Hey! What's up?<eos> Alex, so good to see you.
Oh, lets go look at the pretty white pony with the golden horn.<eos> Let's do that, huh?<eos> Want one? No, thanks.<eos> Hey, don't worry about her, okay?<eos> It's just a thing.<eos> Just a thing?<eos> I invited her tonight to specifically turn her into a dyke.<eos> And he can't keep his hands off her. Dude, come on.<eos> You're not mad at him, you're mad at her.<eos> She's taking Alex away from you.
You just enjoy it.<eos> Biscuit!<eos> What the fuck.<eos> Donnie!<eos> Donnie!<eos> Hey!<eos> Radon, stop the ride!<eos> It's just that, all it would take is one of you to show me respect as a coach and not just your friend and everyone else would be on board.<eos> No. It's not like that, dude.<eos> We respect you.
Donnie!<eos> Hey!<eos> Radon, stop the ride!<eos> It's just that, all it would take is one of you to show me respect as a coach and not just your friend and everyone else would be on board.<eos> No. It's not like that, dude.<eos> We respect you.<eos> Really? Hey, coach summers, fuck you!<eos> - Not cool, man!<eos> - Donnie!<eos> I'm so glad I found you.
We need you right now, coach.<eos> Round up this team right now.<eos> Man, I... Round 'em up!<eos> No.<eos> Round 'em up, coach summers!<eos> Not you too.<eos> Round 'em up! Round 'em up!<eos> Get out of there!<eos> Get of there, coach summers! Yeah!<eos> I'll see you out front.
Why does Thad castle hate the French?<eos> That's the question you idiots have?<eos> Thadland?<eos> Ask him about the drinking.<eos> Ask him about the driving. The accident with the little chick.<eos> Ask him some of this stuff.<eos> What?<eos> Coach!<eos> Oh, yeah, this is great.<eos> Can wear you all the way to...
Okay, what the fuck is Jenkum?<eos> Shit.<eos> It's not...<eos> He said shit again.<eos> Shit. It's poop fumes and pee fumes.<eos> It's very popular in the south.<eos> See, what I've done here is I've rerouted these sewer pipes into this steel tank.<eos> And then whenever anyone uses the facilities, it collects here where it's allowed to ferment at a very high temperature.<eos> Then it's simply a matter of filling these balloons with the fermented fumes, et voila.<eos> This stuff will knock you straight on your ass.
Now shut it down, Harmon.<eos> Shut it down.<eos> Consider it done, captain.<eos> Have you seen Thad?<eos> Thad's upstairs.<eos> Are you an assassin?<eos> Thad?<eos> You can't kill me.<eos> I'm not killable.<eos> I'm not here to kill you.
Shut it down.<eos> Consider it done, captain.<eos> Have you seen Thad?<eos> Thad's upstairs.<eos> Are you an assassin?<eos> Thad?<eos> You can't kill me.<eos> I'm not killable.<eos> I'm not here to kill you.<eos> I'm here to tell you that this party is over.
And what do you even want with my house?<eos> Let's not do this again, senor.<eos> Officer, I carry in my possession information which may interest you and your tiny little benevolent fund.<eos> I didn't catch any of that.<eos> Look at the papers!<eos> I need all available units to blue mountain state campus. All available units.<eos> There goes the department booze cruise.<eos> Argh! Thad, we were teammates for three years.<eos> You've got to trust me.<eos> What is happening? This may come as a surprise to you, but I'm not the super smart Alan Einstein that everyone thinks I am.
Every day, more lies.<eos> Lies?<eos> Would I risk everything for a lie? No, we don't have time for this!<eos> I have to speak to Saw Gerrera before it's too late.<eos> So, you...<eos> Uh. That's-That's for you.<eos> And I gave it to them, they did not find it!<eos> I gave it to them.<eos> Galen Erso.<eos> He told me to find you.
So, you...<eos> Uh. That's-That's for you.<eos> And I gave it to them, they did not find it!<eos> I gave it to them.<eos> Galen Erso.<eos> He told me to find you.<eos> Bor Gullet.<eos> Bor Gullet?<eos> Galen Erso sent me!<eos> He told me to find you!
It's the fuel for the weapon.<eos> The weapon your father's building.<eos> Maybe we should leave target practice behind.<eos> Are you talking about me?<eos> She's right.<eos> We need to blend in.<eos> Stay with the ship.<eos> I can blend in.<eos> I'm an Imperial droid.<eos> This city is under Imperial occupation Half the people here want to reprogram you.
She's right.<eos> We need to blend in.<eos> Stay with the ship.<eos> I can blend in.<eos> I'm an Imperial droid.<eos> This city is under Imperial occupation Half the people here want to reprogram you.<eos> The other half want to put a hole in your head.<eos> I'm surprised you're so concerned with my safety.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm just worried they might miss you and hit me.
The cause?<eos> Seriously?<eos> The Alliance?<eos> The...<eos> The rebels?<eos> Whatever it is you're calling yourself these days?<eos> All it's ever brought me is pain.<eos> You can stand to see the Imperial flag reign across the galaxy?<eos> It's not a problem if you don't look up.<eos> I have something to show you, come.
Now where is Galen Erso?<eos> Standby.<eos> This is the message I was sent.<eos> Saw, if you're watching this, then perhaps there is a chance to save the Alliance.<eos> Perhaps there's a chance to explain myself and, though I don't dare hope for too much, a chance for Jyn, if she's alive, if you can possibly find her... to let her know that<eos> my love for her has never faded and how desperately I've missed her.<eos> Jyn, my Stardust, I can't imagine what you think of me.<eos> When I was taken, I faced some bitter truths.<eos> I was told that, soon enough, Krennic would have you as well.<eos> As time went by, I knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you.
Captain Andor.<eos> Why do you ask that?<eos> What do you mean, does he look like a killer?<eos> The Force moves darkly near a creature that's about to kill.<eos> His weapon was in the sniper configuration.<eos> No, no, no...<eos> We got to go up.<eos> You can't see much from down there.<eos> This way.<eos> I'll be right behind you.
Stardust.<eos> Papa.<eos> I've seen your message.<eos> The hologram, I've seen it.<eos> It must be destroyed<eos> I know. I know.<eos> We will.<eos> Jyn.<eos> Look at you.<eos> I've so much to tell you.
Those were Alliance bombs that killed him!<eos> I had orders!<eos> Orders that I disobeyed!<eos> - But you wouldn't understand that.<eos> - Orders?<eos> When you know they're wrong?<eos> You might as well be a stormtrooper.<eos> What do you know?<eos> We don't all have the luxury of deciding when and where we want to care about something.<eos> Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you?
You don't look happy.<eos> - They prefer to surrender.<eos> - And you?<eos> - She wants to fight.<eos> - So do I. We all do.<eos> The Force is strong.<eos> I'm not sure four of us is quite enough.<eos> - How many do we need?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> They were never going to believe you.
A shiksa. The Swede had done it.<eos> But before he could marry Dawn, she had one great test to pass;<eos> She had to meet the old man, the Swede's father,<eos> Lou Levov, founder and owner of Newark Maid gloves.<eos> He just wants to ask you a couple of things, that's all.<eos> "That's all"? Can't you answer for me?<eos> He wants to get to know you and he's not an easy guy,<eos> - but if you stand your ground...<eos> He'll respect that.<eos> He'll respect you for it.
- You two have a good rest of your day.<eos> - You, too, Mr. Levov.<eos> Something was smiling down on him.<eos> This is the way I thought it would always be.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Life would open its arms and he would carry all before him.<eos> He was the Swede, after all.<eos> Jerry Levov.<eos> God, Nathan!<eos> I didn't expect to see you here.
"I renounce all vices of lying speech arising from anger.<eos> I renounce all sexual pleasure with either Gods or men, all taking of anything not given."<eos> I think you're terrified of what you've done. I'm not going to ask what you've done.<eos> I made up my mind.<eos> I'm not going to ask you anything like that.<eos> But I think that rather than evade punishment, you've taken it into your own hands.<eos> It's all right, Daddy.<eos> I can believe that you can't understand.<eos> I don't believe it's a difficult conclusion to reach, honey.<eos> I don't think I'm the only person who, seeing you here, would come up with that idea.

- Daddy.<eos> - No. Look at what you've done to yourself.<eos> You could die if you keep this up.<eos> But only to be reborn.<eos> Will you at least take off that mask while we're talking so I can see you?<eos> See me stutter, do you mean?<eos> My stutter was only my way of doing no violence to the air.<eos> Well, maybe you would have been better off with your stutter if you had to go this far.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Did you come to Newark to help me find you?
I took a name from a tombstone in a cemetery.<eos> One morning, I received a phone call that I was to go to the Greyhound station.<eos> They gave me a ticket to Chicago.<eos> I would stay there for two days and then travel to Oregon, where there would be sanctuary.<eos> I was raped the night I arrived in Chica-- cago.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Held captive and raped and robbed.<eos> Come home with me, Merry.<eos> You go, Daddy.<eos> Leave you?

Look...<eos> Your ballet shoes, your riding ribbons, all your things.<eos> My stuttering book.<eos> Why have you brought these things?<eos> Does it mean that you aren't coming back?<eos> Because if it does, maybe that's best.<eos> I'm your father.<eos> I made you and I found you.<eos> And there's no way I can ever lose you or you can ever lose me again.<eos> Let me take you home.

That was to be the last time he ever saw her.<eos> He never got over Merry.<eos> He never got over her... and never gave up on her.<eos> It was good to see you.<eos> Will you excuse me?<eos> - Are you taking off?<eos> - Oh, there you are.<eos> Yeah. These days I'm asleep on my feet after 9:00.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Uh, well, it was good to see you. Really.

Sister is inside.<eos> This your first... you must be very careful...<eos> Shivaay.... Congratulations!<eos> You're going to be a father now!<eos> The first three months, you'll have to be very careful.<eos> And anxiety is not good for you, and not for the baby either.<eos> I'm prescribing some vitamins, make sure you take them.<eos> Go inside... go inside...<eos> GO INSIDE! ...<eos> I am not asking you to spend your life here...

What's wrong with you papa?<eos> After what this man has done with me today... you are still advocating for him?<eos> He is a first rate criminal. Unpredictable and... very dangerous too...<eos> And.... a father too!<eos> That's him right?<eos> Look... 90% of us won't get into a mess like this...<eos> But he's different....<eos> He is an extraordinary man in extraordinary circumstances. If I may say so...<eos> My child.. He is only following a father's natural instinct...<eos> And I wouldn't hesitate either, before killing someone if they were to kidnap you...
Oh, yeah, that. Just... Leave that there.<eos> That's, uh...<eos> Russian hackers.<eos> The Agency says they can activate webcams now. So...<eos> That's creepy. Yes.<eos> It's really bothering me.<eos> Whatever. It's not a big deal. You shouldn't let it bother you.<eos> It's not a big deal?<eos> No.<eos> What, that someone could be watching you right now?
Good to have you.<eos> You watch out for him.<eos> That's the smartest guy in the building right here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Bro, how many languages you speak, again?<eos> I mean, seven in code, six spoken, two signs.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Great.<eos> Another language I can't understand.<eos> Uh, I'll check you later, Ed.
No, it's different now.<eos> It's not passive collection, it's full-take surveillance.<eos> It's all of your e-mails, calls, texts, social media, everything.<eos> It's also possible that the house is bugged.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> By who?<eos> By a senior officer at the CIA.<eos> You in trouble?<eos> Is it the Chinese thing?<eos> Look, there's things that I wish I could tell you, but I can't because you could get very hurt.

So, next time, do us all a favor.<eos> Fight back like your life depends on it.<eos> Weren't we supposed to turn there?<eos> The designated route - takes us through Sherman Oaks.<eos> - Jesus. How fuckin' green are you?<eos> Tell me somethin', you're not familiar with the suburbs?<eos> - I was in Manhattan.<eos> - But you have seen Level 5's, right?<eos> I've seen one... today.<eos> Well, imagine hundreds of 'em and they all got eyes for you.
Good.<eos> We aren't going back to the compound, not just yet.<eos> We're gonna go the hospital.<eos> You're gonna get us a car.<eos> You're gonna drive to my house<eos> - and we're gonna save my family. - What the fuck are you talkin' about?<eos> My husband and my daughter, we're gonna go get them.<eos> - You know about this?<eos> - I'm going with her.<eos> We get my family and I will get you back into the compound and have you treated for the virus, but only if you do exactly what I tell you to.
You didn't know how to use the mosquito. You didn't know how to wrap Gunner's shoulder.<eos> But you did fake that blood test pretty quick.<eos> I met some grifters in my day, but you're good.<eos> - You gonna leave me out here?<eos> - No.<eos> Your secret's safe.<eos> Just tell me one thing.<eos> Where'd you learn how to speak like a doctor?<eos> Thesaurus.<eos> Wheeler, I will get you into the compound.
I haven't seen a girl go down like that since...<eos> It's probably not for right now.<eos> Do you remember anything?<eos> Yeah, um, Ben was marrying your mom and Brad.<eos> And how that story ends.<eos> What else?<eos> You kissed me.<eos> Oh, you took me in your arms and you kissed me.<eos> And then?<eos> I kissed you back.
Really? Yeah!<eos> Oh, god, don't start that.<eos> "Really?<eos> Hey, you got ripped off.<eos> "Hey, come on, I could have done this..." ...<eos> Cheaper.<eos> "With $20 and some elbow grease!"<eos> Do you think it would kill you to say, "good job, Matt"?<eos> I mean that seriously.<eos> Do you think it would physically kill you?

You're a barista. And I can see how you could then look down on me from all the way up there.<eos> Next set.<eos> He doesn't...<eos> I don't...<eos> He doesn't tell me what to do.<eos> - He just told you what to...<eos> - I know. I let him.<eos> - What is your name? Mia.<eos> - Mia.<eos> I guess I'll see you in the movies.
But he's- he's figuring it out.<eos> It's just been a little too gilly lately.<eos> Mom, he's gonna find a way to open it and you're gonna love it.<eos> Okay?<eos> How's Dad?<eos> Sebastian.<eos> Come on in, man.<eos> - Thanks for coming.<eos> - Thanks for having me.<eos> I wasn't sure I'd see you today.
How's the play going?<eos> I'm nervous.<eos> You are?<eos> Why?<eos> - Because... what if people show up?<eos> - Pishi kaka.<eos> You're nervous about what they think?<eos> I'm nervous to do it.<eos> I'm nervous to get up on that stage... and perform for people.<eos> I mean, I don't need to say that to you.
What?<eos> All of this.<eos> I'm done embarrassing myself. I'm done.<eos> I'm done.<eos> - Nobody showed up.<eos> - So what?<eos> I can't pay back the theater!<eos> This is so...<eos> I'm gonna go home for a while.<eos> - I'll come see you tomorrow.
You know I'm under a lot of pressure to announce my running mate for the election.<eos> Now, you show me that you got the guts to push this thing through, and you make yourself one very real candidate to become my Vice President of the United States<eos> of America.<eos> A step away from the White House.<eos> And as we've seen, anything can happen from there.<eos> There's a barn owl out there in the live oaks hunting mice.<eos> Is Hubert on board?<eos> Yeah.<eos> One heart attack in a lifetime is plenty, thank you very much.<eos> Why do I put up with you?

Yes, personally Goldwater deplores racism.<eos> I just think asking for my vote while denying me the right to vote is bullshit.<eos> The bill still gives us a lot.<eos> Unless he gives that away, too.<eos> I have his word there will be no more compromises.<eos> His word?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I cannot support a bill without voting rights.<eos> I'm not asking you to.<eos> I'm asking you to not work against it.
Yeah, hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Um, music's a little loud.<eos> I didn't hear you.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> It is so loud...<eos> Hey, you're my new neighbor, aren't you?<eos> I've seen you over there watching me.<eos> - Watching you?
All right.<eos> Bye.<eos> Gabby, I'd like to have a word in private.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Woman on pa:<eos> Dr. Richards to post-anesthesia.<eos> Why did you tell your dad I was coming for dinner tonight?<eos> I have to study.<eos> Because I'm selfish and I want what I want.<eos> Now tell me, why are you staying all the way out there on the sound instead of on this side of the bridge where I can keep you handcuffed to my side?
Apparently her tabby is possessed again.<eos> She needs you to do that exorcism thing you do.<eos> Just when it was getting good.<eos> - You tricked me.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I just having a little fun.<eos> You showed up in my yard all upset.<eos> And then my sister shows up...<eos> - Oh, your sister?<eos> - Yeah, I told you.
- She wants to go again.<eos> - No!<eos> Monica, hey!<eos> We're over here.<eos> Man, they've been on and off since high school.<eos> He ain't ever gonna commit.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Good to see you.
Man, they've been on and off since high school.<eos> He ain't ever gonna commit.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Good to see you.<eos> - How are you?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> - Hey, how are you?<eos> - Nice to see you.
Dr. McCarthy.<eos> He's got two pugs.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Yeah, he does.<eos> All right, folks.<eos> We're going to let some rusty carnival ride maim us.<eos> - So...<eos> - Fun.<eos> ...y'all have a good night.<eos> - Ryan, it was nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you guys.
Oh. - Ryan: Yes, sir.<eos> Can't somebody else go supervise the Atlanta opening?<eos> Who would you suggest, Maryanne?<eos> After all, our name is on the door.<eos> I just have to go shake a few hands.<eos> Make sure the ship is sailing straight.<eos> Be back in a few weeks.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You better stay away from all those pretty interns, hear?<eos> You remember that one back up in Charleston that couldn't keep her hands off of you?
Me?<eos> You want me to do it?<eos> Yes, because I want you to get used to this situation.<eos> Uh-unh.<eos> Now go.<eos> Go.<eos> He's going to be okay.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh!<eos> Now, Taylor, I have something very important to tell you, okay, honey?
I mean, you're not funny, you're not smart.<eos> You're nothing to look at.<eos> No.<eos> I think it's, um... It speaks a little more to, you know, you, and you're just... You feel quite mediocre and really unattractive.<eos> I'm lowering the bar.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's why.<eos> So they can tolerate you.
- Stephanie: Night, y'all. Gabby:<eos> I should get started on the dishes.<eos> You should not.<eos> It's my house, my dishes.<eos> It'll take me two and a half shakes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi, bud.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah!<eos> There's something I want to show you.
You should not.<eos> It's my house, my dishes.<eos> It'll take me two and a half shakes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi, bud.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah!<eos> There's something I want to show you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. All right, so what I'm about to show you,
- Okay.<eos> - Watch it.<eos> Welcome to my island.<eos> Your island?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My grandfather and I used to come out here and fish.<eos> He left it to me when he passed on.<eos> This is where I come when I want to be alone.<eos> And, uh... I don't know.<eos> I wanted to show it to you.
Alice?<eos> I was thinking, um, maybe we could have dinner sometime?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would like that.<eos> Yes, well, so would I.<eos> - Well, okay.<eos> Bye. - Bye.<eos> Earth to Gabby.<eos> Don't you hear the intercom?<eos> I've been paging you.
How are you?<eos> - I missed you.<eos> - Yeah, me, too.<eos> Come on, my parents are over here. Let's go.<eos> Gabby: Okay.<eos> Dr. McCarthy: Oh, hey, look.<eos> Here they are.<eos> Come over here and give me a hug.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Good to see you.
Caught up?<eos> Is that what happened?<eos> We got caught...<eos> We both knew this was coming around the corner.<eos> Neither of us wanted to acknowledge it. All right.<eos> All right, well, here it is.<eos> It's right here, right in front of us.<eos> So let's acknowledge it.<eos> We had an amazing time.<eos> One of those ground-shaking, life-altering, knock you on your ass months, and I wish it could be more.
I'd hate her for it if I was one of those women, but I'm not.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Travis, I, uh...<eos> I'm going to give you some friendly advice, and then I'm going to go home and cry, okay?<eos> Swallow your pride.<eos> You want to be the guy that shows up in ten years with flowers in your hand, Moby by your side, hoping that she'll hear you out?<eos> Praying she'll understand why you quit so easy?<eos> Because that's all any woman wants, is a man who's gonna fight.<eos> So why don't you just do it now and save yourself a whole decade?<eos> You know, she looks at you the same way.
- No!<eos> - Gabby.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> You should probably take a knee, son.<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thanks again.<eos> Gabby.<eos> I think I pretty much said all the words, so all I need is a lifetime to prove it to you.
Easy, easy, easy, easy.<eos> You've seen your mom every day this week.<eos> Let's let her get settled, okay?<eos> - My babies.<eos> - Hi, mommy.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Let me look at you.<eos> Hello, Gabby.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Oh, somebody is dying to meet you.
Drive the fucking car!<eos> Hey, man.<eos> The girl in your trunk, she was in that car.<eos> Johnny's car!<eos> Hey, man, what are you doing with my car?<eos> That's Johnny's car!<eos> Motherfucker!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I swear to God, you get up, I'll shoot you in the cock.<eos> I can pay you.
You're gonna lose this one, all right?<eos> Your word against hers.<eos> No evidence. You lose.<eos> You better seriously think about changing your story.<eos> Oh, fuck it. Maybe they're right.<eos> Maybe the goddamn birds can't breathe.<eos> Amelia, Misty, Dean, Shattuck, all dead.<eos> The rest of us just get to choke.<eos> I need a drink.<eos> - How much do I owe you, buddy?
Who are you?<eos> ! Cut it out. Let's go.<eos> Ow, my head!<eos> Settle down!<eos> Nice.<eos> Luring me in with hot women?<eos> Creative.<eos> I've never seen such a cocky patient.<eos> You don't pick up your results and you won't get re-checked.<eos> The only way was to haul you in.
Okay, bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> I thought you didn't want any more.<eos> Drinking requires three things.<eos> I kept asking myself why I kept coming back.<eos> I finally realized, it's not the night's length that gives it meaning.<eos> I like this name,<eos> See you Tomorrow<eos> It makes me look forward to the next day.<eos> Because that's when I get to see you again.
Go on, cry!<eos> Cry and I'll cut you!<eos> Bottoms up!<eos> Chen Mo!<eos> Thanks to that damn mouth of yours,<eos> Ma Li's in trouble!<eos> That was a watershed night for Ma Li.<eos> Six hours earlier, he finally made good on his promise to Jiang Jie.<eos> All these years, I've always felt I owed you something.<eos> On my birthday today, I want to give it to you.
The house's down-payment, you paid. Four hundred thousand.<eos> We both paid the mortgage, right?<eos> I want the house.<eos> The car was a hundred-ninety thousand.<eos> If you want it, pay that and you can have it.<eos> All my savings are here.<eos> It's yours.<eos> It's easier for a man to earn money.<eos> Keep it all.<eos> If that guy doesn't treat you right, you won't need to worry.
Hi, everyone. I'm Ma Li.<eos> Ma Li will be one act in a ten-act campus concert.<eos> Could you say a little about what you look forward to?<eos> This is my first song and it's one I wrote myself.<eos> I have one principle, and that's to sing only my own songs.<eos> Okay, let's bring on our next guest.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi. I'm Xiao Yu.<eos> Hi. I'm Ma Li.<eos> I just wanted to tell you, that I really, really like your song!
Don't you play me.<eos> Hey!<eos> A movie tomorrow.<eos> A blockbuster...<eos> Titanic.<eos> I'm warning you...<eos> You'd best not be playing me.<eos> Momma said she was going for groceries, and she never came back.<eos> Titanic, right?<eos> If you ain't there when the time comes, I'll chop you like a pineapple.
Say it.<eos> There's nothing with us that can't be said.<eos> Let them hear it.<eos> July 29th, 200s You had on a blue dress,<eos> your hair was in a ponytail.<eos> That's how you looked when I first saw you.<eos> Too embarrassed to say it?<eos> If you won't, then I will.<eos> To hell with your Answer!<eos> Why should I answer you?
Then get lost!<eos> You think I want to be with a slut like you?<eos> Where's Ma Li?<eos> He doesn't even want you anymore!<eos> No one wants a whore.<eos> Get off of me!<eos> Slut!<eos> I'll take you home.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> Let me take you just once more.
Look at the address, idiot.<eos> I don't understand English!<eos> Ecuador.<eos> Mao-Mao!<eos> I'm coming!<eos> Cut the racket!<eos> Boss, a letter from Guan Chun.<eos> "One month later" Guan Chun?<eos> My brother Chen Mo<eos> I wish I could see you.
So, was grandpa really a millionaire? He was a lot more than that.<eos> He was a code breaker during world war ii.<eos> He loved his secrets.<eos> Made the most amazing treasure hunts for us on our birthday.<eos> I remember the last big hunt.<eos> We actually got to use a real decoder from the war.<eos> The last hunt, it took us three days to find our presents. Three whole days.<eos> Done.<eos> Stupid uncle.<eos> Move, and I put a hole in you. Look, I'm sorry.
Do you wanna tell me why you went into the west forest? Ask mark.<eos> He's the one who went in.<eos> Ask Andy.<eos> He's the one who thinks he can find grandpa's treasure.<eos> And Claire thinks there's ghosts.<eos> How old are you? Ghosts?<eos> You haven't listened to a thing I said since you been here, have you?<eos> Have you?<eos> You think I just talk to hear myself speak?<eos> I told you not to go into the forest. There's nothing in there, and there is nothing.
I'm not gonna say this again.<eos> If you want Claire to like you back, maybe you should grow one of your claws bigger. Dude!<eos> Wait, what? Well, that's what these guys do.<eos> You see, the boy lobster grows one claw bigger than the other, not even to hunt or anything.<eos> It's really just to impress the girl lobster. It's true.<eos> You know the most random crap, you know that?<eos> You're just jealous 'cause you don't...<eos> Hey!<eos> Mark, it's okay. Andy!<eos> Once they get ahold of you like that, they never let go.
You now hold every clue."<eos> What? Great.<eos> Grandpa was crazy.<eos> If only we had the other pocket watch.<eos> Dude!<eos> You little ninja.<eos> Check this out!<eos> "Use birthday decoder."<eos> The world war ii decoder at your house. We have to get it.<eos> No, no, my dad would kill you if he caught you even breathing on it.
When you do that, when your questions are all wrong, you're just gonna miss what it's all about.<eos> What what's all about?<eos> The treasure that never runs dry.<eos> I had my shot, and I blew it.<eos> Don't.<eos> "Backstroke champion, Trent Walton."<eos> "Dear Andy, I'm sorry I can't be the father you deserve."<eos> "You never should have come. Forget about me."<eos> "Dear Andy, if only I could find the words,<eos> "or find the strength to reach out to you,
Running an experiment. How would I have solved the crime, - if I'd been there in 1895?<eos> I had all the details perfect.<eos> I was there, all of it, everything.<eos> I was immersed.<eos> Of course you were.<eos> You've been reading John's blog.<eos> The story of how you met.<eos> It helps me if I see myself through his eyes sometimes.<eos> I'm so much cleverer.<eos> Do you really think anyone is believing you?
I've seen him do it.<eos> We have an agreement, my brother and I, ever since that day.<eos> Wherever I find him, whatever back alley or doss-house... ..there will always be a list.<eos> He couldn't have taken all that in the last five minutes.<eos> - He was high before he got on the plane.<eos> - He didn't seem high.<eos> - Nobody deceives like an addict.<eos> - I'm not an addict, I'm a user.<eos> I alleviate boredom and occasionally heighten my thought processes.<eos> For God's sake! This could kill you!
Gothic enough?<eos> Mad enough, even for you?<eos> It doesn't make sense, Sherlock, because it's not real.<eos> - None of it.<eos> - What's he talking about?<eos> This is all in your mind.<eos> You're dreaming.<eos> - Argh! - Is he dreaming?<eos> And there he is.<eos> Thought we'd lost you for a moment.
- Seriously...<eos> - Then what?<eos> What about the rent?<eos> I don't even have money for the internet café.<eos> Always the internet café and shit.<eos> I told you, I won't do it anymore.<eos> - Then what?<eos> - Then what, what?<eos> Should we sleep under the stars then?<eos> Then go to the station, and ask the homeless if you can join the family, they'll keep you warm.
Look over there!<eos> Get your shit together and look!<eos> You see that car?<eos> Get down to that roof, and lure them away from that alley.<eos> No, no, I can't!<eos> Listen carefully, asshole!<eos> Lure them by shouting.<eos> Get them to come to you, and I'll get the car and go to the main street.<eos> Then you run through that alley and reach the street.<eos> I'll meet you there, got it?
Ki-woong!<eos> I'm in trouble!<eos> Where are you?<eos> There's trouble everywhere.<eos> Your father came to find you!<eos> What?<eos> My father?<eos> Yeah, I'm with him now.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'll come and pick you up.
Hye-sun, Hye-sun.<eos> Hye-sun...<eos> Ki-woong.<eos> It's all over, it's OK.<eos> Ki-woong, is it safe now?<eos> Yeah, it's safe, we can go home now.<eos> And dad?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Don't worry, he's OK.<eos> We split up to look for you.
Come on!<eos> Let go!<eos> Please don't do this, OK?<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> How dare you?<eos> You're so dead!<eos> Come at me, asshole?<eos> Get the hell up!<eos> Fuck!<eos> I'll kill you.
- What are we doing?<eos> What is this place?<eos> - Still remember?<eos> - Brennan, no I don't want to<eos> - Hey, come on, come on.<eos> You're so good.<eos> - Your memory is of a girl seven years ago that's not still me.<eos> - Hey, I think it is.<eos> - You're the musician who is now working some bullshit nine to five job,<eos> I should be pushing you onto a stage somewhere.
- He lied to me.<eos> - Somebody else?<eos> - No, with pills.<eos> - But you never?<eos> - No, are you kidding?<eos> No, and I didn't think that he would have, either.<eos> But, yeah, looking back it made sense.<eos> - I would not do drugs behind your back.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> I wouldn't lie to you either.
Yeah, you too, bye.<eos> - I, uh, picked them myself, well, I didn't pick them, you know.<eos> - Yeah, well, they're interesting.<eos> Oh, and a card.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome. - You sure you don't want something?<eos> - Bleh, no.<eos> I still feel queasy.<eos> Looking at you makes me feel sick.
- This is going to be the greatest song ever written on a napkin.<eos> - I need a, I need cigarettes.<eos> - Oh, we can leave.<eos> - No, I have a full drink.<eos> - I think there's a store on the next block.<eos> - Thank you, Brennan.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Hot damn, what a surprise to find you still here.
Go!<eos> Seal the deal at 2 Lapis Lazuli!<eos> The master is not used to bickering.<eos> Forgive him master, he is not from the city.<eos> He is unaware of the rules of Mohenjo Daro.<eos> 2 Lapis Lazuli!<eos> Load the goods in the cart behind.<eos> That was close.<eos> Do not repeat what you just did!<eos> I may not be able to save you the next time.
She is a symbol of Mother Sindhu's Grace and Blessing on this city.<eos> They say that Chaani's birth foretells the coming of a New Order for Mohenjo Daro.<eos> New Order?<eos> Chaani, look at that!<eos> Apologise to Junu!<eos> Let it go, Chaani.<eos> Did you not hear me?<eos> Apologise!<eos> Or else...<eos> I will turn you into a toad!
Apologise to Junu!<eos> Let it go, Chaani.<eos> Did you not hear me?<eos> Apologise!<eos> Or else...<eos> I will turn you into a toad!<eos> A toad?<eos> This is my final warning!<eos> If you do not apologise...<eos> I will turn you into a toad.
This is the life's fair, breathing dance in the air<eos> The rich here is set apart with the wealth of one's heart<eos> (Ancient Dilmoon Language)<eos> The moon and the sun has witnessed The grand fair of colours in Mohenjo Daro<eos> The night that has descended<eos> And the season she has brought in her arms<eos> May this season sow seeds of passion in your heart<eos> Heed my words<eos> Choose my path<eos> The path that rids you of all anxieties
- I agree with him!<eos> I do not want to pay the additional tax!<eos> We will not pay!<eos> I have never seen that man before.<eos> This has not happened in twenty monsoons!<eos> Where did this audacity come from?<eos> Kulka, find out...<eos> who he is!<eos> Right away.<eos> The wind has stopped to listen, even the fish are staring at you... say something, Chaani!
Junu, I must meet him!<eos> Right now!<eos> But where will I find him?<eos> I don't even know where to look for him!<eos> If he is still in the Lower City... he must be waiting for the cattle herders of Dholavira.<eos> We could find him in the cattle bazaar tomorrow.<eos> So... let's go to the cattle bazaar!<eos> Chaani, you should not be here looking like this.<eos> I'm worried!<eos> If someone recognises you, we'll be in big trouble.
So... let's go to the cattle bazaar!<eos> Chaani, you should not be here looking like this.<eos> I'm worried!<eos> If someone recognises you, we'll be in big trouble.<eos> Let us see!<eos> No one recognises me...<eos> or is even looking at me!<eos> Do not be worried, Junu!<eos> Now let's go find him.<eos> It would be best if he does not recognise you either!
Smiling?<eos> Is she smiling?<eos> You have begun to take a liking to every girl in this city.<eos> Will you keep staring or will you say something too?<eos> Sarman, the goats are done and that pair of bulls-<eos> Chaani, happy to see him?<eos> You're in the middle of the market, not in private... anything can...<eos> It's a clay bird... I made it.<eos> You did not wear your headdress today, but I instantly recognised you.<eos> I wanted to see you.
You won't find her there today.<eos> Tonight, there is a Moon Ritual at the Great Bath.<eos> Until the ritual is over, Chaani cannot return to the Shrine.<eos> Moon Ritual?<eos> Yes... it's the lover's-alliance night.<eos> Any boy and girl, who confess their love under the full moon tonight... then their Union is sealed.<eos> Really?<eos> Then I have to meet Chaani tonight!<eos> You cannot go there, Sarman!<eos> What if Moonja recognises you?
She's not so innocent.<eos> The rumors of her new 'company' are being heard.<eos> Now, to wait for even one more sunrise is too long!<eos> Maham, just a little while longer, I will speak to Chaani.<eos> This is an order, not a request Priest!<eos> And you are aware of the consequences, if you disobey me.<eos> Were you not Chaani's father...<eos> Make preparations!<eos> Chaani's Union with Moonja will take place after two suns.<eos> Looking at you, brings back memories of my Union.
I did!<eos> The cause of Srujan's death was not Maham... it was me!<eos> I cannot even ask for your forgiveness, Sarman!<eos> How can I?<eos> That is why everything seemed so familiar.<eos> I was born here.<eos> I spent my childhood here.<eos> My father gave his life for this city... and this city gave him death.<eos> It was imperative that I tell you the truth about your past, Sarman!<eos> May Mother Sindhu protect you and give you strength!
Let's go!<eos> First, we must give him peace!<eos> Senate Chief Srujan!<eos> He had always spoken the truth!<eos> My father!<eos> So many monsoons have passed!<eos> Why did you not tell me about my past?<eos> I was afraid, Sarman.<eos> I had already lost Srujan...<eos> I was afraid that I would lose you too.
Now I want to serve Mohenjo Daro.<eos> Tell us, what must we do?<eos> The traders from Sumer have left with their carts full of Gold.<eos> We must stop them!<eos> This is our only chance to expose Maham's betrayal.<eos> - Right!<eos> When do we leave?<eos> - Now!<eos> Ishme-Dagan!<eos> This path will lead you straight to Dholavira.
You think you're pretty slick kidnapping my partner.<eos> Thanks, I do.<eos> I'm not finished.<eos> Oh, sorry, go ahead.<eos> You messed with the wrong cop.<eos> And, Geils, if you're listening, just know that I will not rest.<eos> I know, Angie.<eos> Will somebody just let me finish?<eos> Oh, sorry, go ahead.<eos> Until I find you.
I don't really mind death.<eos> I've buried people before.<eos> People I really cared about.<eos> In the end we're all just compost anyway.<eos> Everything regenerates.<eos> I'd like to come back as a cat.<eos> I've been so depressed since my cat died.<eos> His name was Greymalkin, but he was black and white.<eos> He was my best friend.<eos> - I give the rainbow to you.
A man, I hope.<eos> - Yes, it was a man.<eos> But, it didn't work out.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Yes, it's a shame and I really liked him.<eos> I thought that he was the one.<eos> - Well, maybe next time.<eos> - Are you sure you won't have some cake?<eos> - Oh, no, thank you.<eos> I just came over to check up on you and to say good bye.
- I guess that's what it was.<eos> But, I don't know.<eos> - Honey, you have to be more careful.<eos> Maybe you shouldn't be messing with love spells in the first place, you know.<eos> - Merry meet, Elaine.<eos> - Bright blessings Gahan.<eos> - I heard you discussing love spells.<eos> You do have to be careful, Elaine.<eos> Love spells never work the way you think they will.<eos> But on a lighter note, it's wonderful to see you, Elaine.
What?<eos> You're not crazy.<eos> Well, if you're not crazy then you're stupid.<eos> Which is it?<eos> Are you crazy or are you stupid?<eos> And you could lose a few pounds.<eos> You're looking a little fatty.<eos> - Oh my god, Elaine, you've lost so much weight.<eos> You have such a hot body now.<eos> Do you like it when I touch you like this?
Here, a satanic cult sacrifices a child.<eos> - Does this stuff really go on today?<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> Those who practice human sacrifice are the black witches who perform blood rituals to gain demonic powers and to bind their members together in secrecy.<eos> Law has been trying to root out these cults for decades but they've been unsuccessful.<eos> Then there are the white witches or Wiccans who commune in nature in the healing spirit and who have a strict law that forbids harming others.<eos> Every city and rural village today has pockets of both black and white witches who practice the ancient rites.<eos> - I invoke and call upon thee, mighty mother of us all.<eos> I invoke thee to descend upon the body of this thy servant and priestess.<eos> - Of the mother darksome and divine here I charge you in this sign.
- Don't you wanna hear it?<eos> - Steve, captain wants us to lay off the case.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - He says we have a policy of leaving the witches alone.<eos> He says they've lived in this town a long time and he doesn't like to mess with them.<eos> - Even if they murder.<eos> - He says he's satisfied that Wayne's death was a heart attack.<eos> I think so too.<eos> - Has everyone gone crazy around here?<eos> Let me at least tell you what I found.
- You mean because she's a witch?<eos> That doesn't mean anything.<eos> - No, her husband died of a drug he'd never taken before.<eos> And did you ever find where Wayne Peters got the devil's weed?<eos> - I questioned Ms. Curtis about that.<eos> There was devil's weed growing near his cabin.<eos> Apparently, he experimented often with drugs.<eos> - Come on Griff, can't you connect the dots?<eos> We have a possible murder here and Elaine is our only suspect.<eos> - I told you, we're laying off her.
- Who is he?<eos> - He's a detective and he's everything a woman could ever want.<eos> He's strong and handsome, smart and kind. I just know that he's the one.<eos> He even gave me this ring.<eos> I call it my magic ring.<eos> It's not an engagement ring but I just know that he's gonna pop the question soon.<eos> - When we first came here I showed you my engagement ring, remember?<eos> I can barely stand to look at it anymore.<eos> It's too painful.<eos> I'm sure he's going to ask you soon.
- Gin and tonic coming up.<eos> - Did you read about the teacher buried in the back yard of his cabin?<eos> They said it was dug by the witches.<eos> - Oh yeah, I read about that.<eos> They found all kinds of witchcraft things on the grave.<eos> - Yeah, I heard about that, too.<eos> Creepy.<eos> - Sit down, Elaine.<eos> Elaine, the DNA came back from the lab.<eos> It connects you with Wayne Peters.
Sometimes it's almost scary how strong the love gets.<eos> - Love?<eos> What do you know about love?<eos> What you call love is a borderline personality disorder or worse.<eos> - Don't diagnose me.<eos> Maybe you're a narcissist who can't love.<eos> You think that I'm sick because you've never loved like I have.<eos> Well, I would do anything for love.<eos> - That's right, you'll never get enough love.<eos> Even when a man loves you so much it kills him, it's not enough for you.
You think that I'm sick because you've never loved like I have.<eos> Well, I would do anything for love.<eos> - That's right, you'll never get enough love.<eos> Even when a man loves you so much it kills him, it's not enough for you.<eos> You're like a bottomless hole.<eos> You doll yourself up and do the Stepford wife thing thinking every man is going to fall at your feet.<eos> But your creepy little sexy act doesn't work with me.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> - How can you stand there and boast about being immune to love?<eos> Why does the genuine love of a woman scare you so much?
Is the door locked? Yeah.<eos> Okay, here.<eos> Now, lift me up. Okay.<eos> Are you okay? Mm-hmm!<eos> Can I help? Hm-mm-hm-mm.<eos> Tie it tight.<eos> Good?<eos> You're gonna have to push me.<eos> - Push you?
How did you get so good at this?<eos> Well, I just sort of got used to building places to hide in.<eos> I like the stripes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We need a theme.<eos> Maybe we should do something different for each bar.<eos> Should we put paint on our face. Can I paint your face?<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You take care of the universe, the universe will take care of you.
I never realized before...<eos> What?<eos> You need me as much as I need you.<eos> Ruthie.<eos> Honey, I need you more.<eos> Mom, that's my clip.<eos> You gave it to me.<eos> When did I give it to you?<eos> You said you didn't want to wear clips anymore.<eos> I did not give it to you.
- Tell her to shut the hell up... Before she gets us all killed.<eos> Floor 23.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Floor 19.<eos> Recruits!<eos> Listen up... gas leak!<eos> You use your gun on this level and it goes kaboom!<eos> You're gonna have to slice 'em up, soldiers.<eos> How do you live?<eos> I will get you out of here.
Have you seen Taylor?<eos> Taylor, Slayer Girl, Taylor.<eos> - You guys get split up? - Yeah.<eos> You hear that?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You really think you can beat me, little man?<eos> I got a helmet on, you moron.<eos> I know.<eos> What, you think that's funny?<eos> If I had more time I'd beat you to death.
We're training.<eos> Sort of.<eos> As soon as the sun goes down, it's turtle time.<eos> Hi, drone.<eos> You talkin' to me?<eos> 'Cause I don't see anybody else...<eos> I failed, Master Splinter.<eos> You put me in charge, and Shredder slipped through our fingers.<eos> There's nothing you could have done to stop it.<eos> Do not let this setback distract you.
Save any questions you have until the end.<eos> Remember I went back to Craigh na Dun that day to look for a flower that I'd seen near the stones.<eos> I know how it must sound, that I've gone mad.<eos> It's quite the leap of faith.<eos> But...<eos> It is one that I am prepared to make as well.<eos> Don't patronize me, Frank.<eos> It's insane, I know that.<eos> It sounds like a... a fantasy made of magic and fairy dust.<eos> Are you trying to argue me out of believing you?
Yours and mine.<eos> Raised in a lie.<eos> No, with a father.<eos> A living, breathing man.<eos> Not the echo of a memory that they can never catch.<eos> Not a ghost.<eos> Precisely.<eos> You have other conditions?<eos> Only one.<eos> While I draw breath on this earth, I cannot share you with another man.
Like he's here.<eos> I'm here, I'm right here, and I'm not going away.<eos> You're a hard one to get rid of, that's for sure.<eos> I'm stubborn, just like my husband.<eos> Hmm. Now... let's talk about the future, and how we're going to change it.<eos> You're talking about stopping the Jacobite rebellion?<eos> Well, that is what we agreed to, isn't it?<eos> I thought we agreed to think about it?<eos> If there's going to be a war against the British, should we not be trying to find a way to win it instead of stopping it?<eos> Well, I don't know enough details to tell you how to do that.
The rising is doomed to failure.<eos> it must not happen.<eos> Again, not the reason.<eos> The true reason behind yer certainty remains carefully hid.<eos> And you're hiding it from me.<eos> You're right.<eos> We are keeping it hidden.<eos> But believe me, if we could...<eos> One day... I will tell you the reason.<eos> I vow to you.
Also a crippled hand and several scars across his mangled body.<eos> Now, I ask you plainly, does any man need further reason to rise up against a king that would allow such horrors to be carried out in his name?<eos> No. The cause can only be strengthened by your sword.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you, brother.<eos> Will you help us then?<eos> In what way?<eos> What is it exactly that you would wish me to do?<eos> I want to meet the Jacobite leaders face to face.<eos> I want to hear their plans, how they mean to carry them out.<eos> Why should they meet with you?
Claire, trust me.<eos> Claire, we have to go.<eos> There's nothing more you can do here.<eos> I have done nothing more than state the truth.<eos> Make no mistake.<eos> The Comte will not forget what happened.<eos> You've made an enemy here today.<eos> Another country, another enemy.<eos> Life with you is certainly never dull, Sassenach.<eos> I shall endeavor to be more dull, if that would suit you better.
"Don't be stupid, take the deal."<eos> The first time I saw Naz, he was sitting alone in a holding cell at the 21st Precinct.<eos> He'd just been arrested.<eos> I walked past him, out of the station and then stopped.<eos> I turned around and went back.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I didn't see what I see in my other clients.<eos> And I still don't after all this time.<eos> What I see is what happens when you put a kid in Rikers and say, "Okay, now survive that<eos> "while we try you for something you didn't do."
This is on The Onion.<eos> So, you know, mixed. Let's call it mixed reviews.<eos> So first you're in a group.<eos> You introduce us to the Style Boyz, and Donkey Roll, of course, we play the hell out of that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's a hit for us, man.<eos> And then, Conner, you get that breakout moment.<eos> You get a phone call from Claudia Cantrell.<eos> The one and only.<eos> And she asks you for a verse, man, on her song Turn Up the Beef.
That was ridiculous.<eos> Right?<eos> Oh, my God, yes, that was insane.<eos> I mean, who would wanna listen to music that way?<eos> Swag.<eos> - I know it's kind of weird, but Aquaspin's gonna help us get the music out there, man.<eos> I mean... You don't think people are gonna have a problem when music just appears in their houses?<eos> Look, I know it sounds lame, but there's no such thing as selling out anymore, man.<eos> This is how big business works.<eos> I mean, nowadays, if you don't sell out, people will wonder if nobody asked you to.
You know how it is?<eos> - That is great...<eos> Hell, yeah!<eos> We gonna turn up a show up here!<eos> Oh, don't hurt me.<eos> - You know how it is!<eos> - Okay.<eos> But seriously, man.<eos> I'm real honored, dawg.<eos> I'm not gonna let you down.
We've got to lock up.<eos> Let me out, man.<eos> Unlock the doors.<eos> Yeah, you should go, man.<eos> Bail. That's your move.<eos> That's not my move.<eos> That's your move. You bailed.<eos> I didn't bail.<eos> People liked me best, and you couldn't handle it, so I did my own thing.<eos> People liked you best 'cause of the shit I wrote.
No, you're doing it again, all right?<eos> Just stop. You fed us dog shit? What is wrong with you?<eos> Owen, chill out, man.<eos> You're the only one who passed the test. You're good.<eos> How the fuck can you think I was one of your lackeys, dude?<eos> I'm your oldest friend.<eos> Hey, we're friends!<eos> We're all friends.<eos> I should've told you to fuck off years ago, but instead I just let you become a bigger and bigger dick.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, but I've kept you on the tour.
No. No.<eos> I mean, all right, look, maybe time for some vocal lessons, you know.<eos> No shame in that. Yeah, or you know who would sound better on it?<eos> Clay Aiken.<eos> No, you.<eos> No.<eos> No, man. This is your thing, and I'm hella proud of you, man.<eos> And, fuck, man, I just...<eos> I wanna just say I'm sorry.<eos> Conner, just... Like, I love that you're doing this right now, but it's really hard to take you seriously because you just look like Jason Segel right now.
Conner, what up, though, dawg?<eos> Oh, yeah, what up, Hunter?<eos> Yo, yo, yo. Say hey to my doc real quick, baby.<eos> Hi.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got a doc. I got a doc. You know what I'm saying?<eos> But now, like, I'm rolling with all these dudes and with Aquaspin.<eos> Like, I kind of Single-White-Femaled your ass.<eos> Yeah, man, that's crazy.<eos> Anyway, though, good to see you, man.
I allow Cincinnati PD to fully partake in my investigations, but at the end of the day, don't make the mistake.<eos> That money says federal reserve now.<eos> Well, you didn't do a very good job of reserving it.<eos> - Wow, that's very clever.<eos> - Mims, calm it.<eos> Captain O'Connell, shut the fuck up.<eos> Do you know how I'm able to tell him that, Mims?<eos> Because my official title is Special Agent in Charge which gives me the authority over a Special Agent who's over your Captain who's over you.<eos> You don't take evidence from a crime scene until I get there.<eos> You don't do a fucking raid unless I tell you.
The press gets hold of that, it'll look like the Boondock fucking Saints.<eos> You're right.<eos> - You still should've reported it to me.<eos> - What, the FBI doesn't have any press leaks?<eos> I know you guys do, it's not like you make any more money than we are.<eos> Guess again, I live up in Akron next to Lebron.<eos> - I'm assigning an agent to you.<eos> - Fuck that!<eos> Fuck you, "fuck that", do you have any idea how incriminating it is what you just did?<eos> There's just no pleasing you, man.
I'm right where I need to be.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I have obtained verified confidential files that indicate Jeffrey Hubert of Hubert National was directly related to the death of his brother, Alexander Hubert in 2011.<eos> What was once believed to be a deadly kidnapping perpetrated by a rogue ranger team now appears to be directly linked to none other than our very own Senator Cook, who falsely informed the ranger team that weapons of mass destruction<eos> were to be found at the temporary Costa Rican home of Alexander Hubert resulting in the young man's death.<eos> The soldiers were then tragically killed on the scene and falsely painted as traitors.<eos> Do you know what I think about a lot?<eos> Your death.<eos> I don't mean with the lethal injection that's probably... what, a good 10 years away.<eos> What I think about is... Killing you with my own hands.
Look who it is, come on in here!<eos> Hey, Mr. Lucky, the escape artist, how'd you get away?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Okay, explain this to me. Why'd your boys just get arrested with some of the robbery money?<eos> Some of the money?<eos> Yeah, you look disappointed, I thought you'd have the rest.<eos> Are they okay?<eos> No, Derohan is not okay, he's less than okay.<eos> - Why didn't you tell us, why didn't you report it?<eos> I'll tell you why, because you were gonna try and rip off the load.
I need a full report.<eos> But judging by the file names, these are government records.<eos> - Okay. - This guy was a data broker.<eos> Well, whatever he brokered, must have been important enough to get him killed.<eos> Authorize full operational control of all systems for everyone now on board.<eos> _<eos> Dr. Omari to Intake, please.<eos> Dr. Omari to Intake.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Nice to see you too, Miller.
What for?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A few weeks before she shipped out, she asked me to hook her up with a data broker.<eos> This guy.<eos> Where can I find him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where does he work out of?<eos> Come on!<eos> He'd...<eos> He'd kill me if I told you.
Dzeet!<eos> Dzeet!<eos> Dzeet!<eos> Dzeet!<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Impound our haul and there's nothing left for your taxman.<eos> Oh, are we being too hard on you?<eos> Should we cut you a break?<eos> We are just tryin' to feed our families, okay?<eos> I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you...
Is she alive?<eos> She chose to be OPA because she believed that what we are fighting for is just.<eos> You took an innocent kid and you forced her to do your dirty work.<eos> No!<eos> She came to me.<eos> Asked me to help her.<eos> She knew what she was doing.<eos> She was willing to make a sacrifice for us.<eos> It's more than you.<eos> She trusted you, she put herself in your hands 'cause she couldn't see the blood on 'em.
Fred Johnson turned his back on Earth.<eos> The OPA killed your son.<eos> You sure this isn't personal?<eos> You're damn right it's personal.<eos> All right.<eos> You keep me in the loop.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm Daniel.<eos> I'm not interested, Daniel.<eos> Tell me. How do they treat you here?
I didn't mean it like that.<eos> Like what?<eos> I'm going to stop talking.<eos> Two more, please!<eos> It's an honest living.<eos> It's more honest than most.<eos> And you can tell a lot about a place by how they treat their people.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Why don't you spend some scrip?<eos> Go on, it'd be good for you.
The ship's ready.<eos> Are you?<eos> I guess we lost Amos.<eos> Oh, he'll be here in a sec.<eos> I guess I'll put on some coffee.<eos> You people drive a hard bargain.<eos> You got our recorded statements.<eos> We'll bring your Lionel Polanski home, if he's out there.<eos> In return, I want you to help me find someone.<eos> Someday, I'll come to you with a name.
- Oh, there's an idea!<eos> Hey there, fellas!<eos> Uh, welcome to the neighborhood.<eos> See you're extending out your docking tube, though there might be a little problem with the link-up, uh...<eos> We're still workin' out some kinks.<eos> Amos, we are not those guys.<eos> We're not the assholes.<eos> I'm done talking, Holden.<eos> We're about to have company.<eos> I will take you down, before I let you take them down.
Why she's on Eros?<eos> Trust your gut before your head gets in the way.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I used to spout off all kinds of bullshit back in the day.<eos> Like how the road to hell is paved with good intentions.<eos> Look, when I got kicked off the force, I gave you that hat so you'd keep your head, not make the same mistakes I did.<eos> Oh, I must have forgot it back on Ceres.<eos> Yeah, you forgot it back on Ceres.<eos> And now you're following this girl out to the ass-crack of the solar system, huh?<eos> Get yourself fired.<eos> Yeah, what in your head even tells you that this girl's lookin' to get rescued?
The cops are gonna be all over us.<eos> We need to get back to the Roci and off this rock now.<eos> He's right.<eos> We shouldn't separate.<eos> I'm going to prep the ship for dust-off.<eos> You guys meet us there.<eos> We both followed Julie here.<eos> We both have part of the story.<eos> I want the truth as bad as you do.<eos> Thank you for letting me come.
Let's go.<eos> Get over there.<eos> Please don't stop here.<eos> Please don't stop here.<eos> Please don't stop here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Over there.<eos> How long until your girlfriend takes off?<eos> She's not my girlfriend.<eos> She ain't gonna leave you here, is she?
Après-ski!<eos> Let's get our drink on!<eos> No, I don't think I'm gonna be doing that.<eos> I'm gonna get a sensible meal, head back to my room, log in my times, chart my progress, 'cause I'm gonna win.<eos> Win what?<eos> - At skiing.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> What's shakin', brother?<eos> Oh, what's shakin'?<eos> Well, I'll tell you what's shakin'-- these skis, quite literally.
All right, look, forget about the model, all right?<eos> Let's not talk about the model.<eos> The only model that you should know is Tatiana.<eos> Tatiana, come in here.<eos> Meet Tatiana.<eos> She came all the way from Bulgaria to hand-deliver her finest caviar.<eos> Nicely done, Frank.<eos> She'll be a fitting reward for me after I win the big race.<eos> Until then,<eos> Tatiana, I want you to clean yourself, for I will enter you hard and deep, and it will last for as long or as short as I please.
I thought you were a champion.<eos> Why?<eos> You showed me some real stuff out there, guy.<eos> I was falling.<eos> You were falling, but you were fast.<eos> But I crashed into some tables.<eos> Crashing and exploding is all part of the learning curve.<eos> I could turn you into a champion, but that's clearly not what you want.<eos> You want to just be a burnout and a loser like those other guys.<eos> Dude, I don't even understand you, man.
You'd get in a lot of trouble for something like that.<eos> That's, like...<eos> Just... You know, 'cause that's not fun for me.<eos> How 'bout if I show you my dick?<eos> Why would I want that?<eos> Oh, okay, okay, it's a prank if you don't want to see it but he shows you anyway.<eos> This guy gets it.<eos> It's gonna be hilarious.<eos> I think I get it.<eos> I'm gonna get myself hard, and I will show you what I mean.
Uh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to spy.<eos> I was just walking by; I'm not a Peeping Tom.<eos> Oh, Charlie, I do not mind.<eos> We are on the mountain.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Everyone keeps saying, "We're on the mountain,"<eos> but I-I don't get it, you know what I mean?<eos> Look, where I come from, you know, jamming your dick through a hole in the wall, that-that's assault, that's a felony, and, uh, it's just plain wrong.<eos> Something bothering you, Charlie?
- Louis, honey, honey, Mommy's here.<eos> Natalie! He's still recovering. You could hurt him.<eos> Louis, it's Dr. Pascal.<eos> You're in the hospital, okay?<eos> Hey, bud.<eos> What you reading?<eos> Ah, Cousteau.<eos> The Living Sea again.<eos> You still like it?<eos> I got to talk to you about something, okay?
They had their problems, and Louis had all these theories about their marriage. He was very smart that way.<eos> Children, they always know so much more than we think.<eos> What you think Dad got me for my birthday?<eos> I hope he got me another Rasputin.<eos> I don't know. How would I know?<eos> It's him!<eos> He's here.<eos> There's my boy.<eos> Put me down, you big bully.<eos> It's good to see you.
I packed all your favorite things.<eos> - Want some of these?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I know you like these.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Before I met your father, it was just you and me.<eos> I never told you that.<eos> Maybe you figured it out.<eos> Sometimes I think you figured it all out.<eos> I nearly lost you that night.
- Want some of these?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I know you like these.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Before I met your father, it was just you and me.<eos> I never told you that.<eos> Maybe you figured it out.<eos> Sometimes I think you figured it all out.<eos> I nearly lost you that night.<eos> I nearly lost you so many times.
He thought we were married.<eos> A year later, we were.<eos> It was difficult for Daddy's first wife.<eos> But he didn't love her.<eos> It was me he loved.<eos> But he scares me now, Lou-Lou.<eos> I can feel him. It's like he's here somewhere.<eos> Why is she telling me these stories?<eos> All this stupid blah, blah, blah in my ear.<eos> I can feel him getting closer and closer, trying to take you back.
I bet it makes you hungry.<eos> Sure.<eos> Give me a list.<eos> We had bread and pepperoni and cheese and beer for them and apple juice for me.<eos> Mom wanted me to slow down because she thought I'd get a stomachache.<eos> She's always scared that I'm going to puke or swallow a screw by accident.<eos> That can happen.<eos> I once ate a Phillips head by accident.<eos> You ask her.<eos> She'll tell you. I'm not a liar.
From now on, no more basement!<eos> It's all in here!<eos> I also want to thank Chairman Desmoines for his sound judgement and to give him the last word.<eos> Thank you, Mr Mercier.<eos> To all of you who work at Sogetec, I have only one thing to say.<eos> Once we've all had a drink, it's back to work!<eos> Cheers!<eos> Granny!<eos> Granddad!<eos> So good to see you.
Hello.<eos> What's with the hat?<eos> What happened to "Hello"?<eos> Hello, my love.<eos> - Don't touch my hat.<eos> - Your hat?<eos> Yes, my hat.<eos> - It's a man's hat.<eos> - True.<eos> - So a man gave it to you?
You just want to have it off.<eos> You've changed, Fanny.<eos> - You're different.<eos> - I have changed.<eos> I've changed!<eos> For some reason I've changed.<eos> Take a good look at me. This was my last lousy train ride to your lousy hotel.<eos> I don't care about your wife any more because it's over!<eos> I'm leaving you! I\\ \. I\ Q x \ K' I<eos> I'm throwing you out of my life!

I went to the park.<eos> The park?<eos> Don't tell me you went out in your pyjamas?<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> I've had enough.<eos> How can I get ready in this mess?<eos> Pierre, I beg you.<eos> Make an effort.<eos> Shave that beard, dress normally, brush your hair.<eos> I can't stand seeing you like this.
- Odd.<eos> - Odd?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Or maybe it's my jacket.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Long time, no see.<eos> Maria, I'm going.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> For no reason.<eos> I've got you back.
Hold out your hand.<eos> Next time you feel like talking back, remember the taste of this metal bead.<eos> You'll sleep alone from tonight.<eos> All right?<eos> Please give me a light.<eos> We've been ordered to save oil.<eos> You little brat.<eos> Speak Japanese!<eos> In there is a man the size of an ogre who can't stand the sound of girls screaming.<eos> If he hears you, he'll burst in through that door after you.
Penis.<eos> Vagina.<eos> P... penis.<eos> Vagina.<eos> You think if you speak Korean, I won't understand?<eos> I was going a bit crazy, so I made them crazy too.<eos> When Mrs. Sasaki looked as crazy as me, life was more bearable.<eos> I know you are a bit insane.<eos> It runs in your mother's family.<eos> That's why I'm training you.
Your fortune going to a pervert?<eos> So he can buy 10 little girls and teach them to read books?<eos> My uncle will find us somehow.<eos> Then he'll take us to the basement.<eos> Uncle.<eos> The basement?<eos> It says here when people are hanged, their tongues stick out and faeces is expelled.<eos> But that day, Aunt's mouth was shut and her bottom was clean.<eos> Want to go somewhere nice?<eos> I'll tell you in detail what I did to your aunt after I caught her running away.
Scotty!<eos> Scotty!<eos> Is he still here?<eos> I want to see him. Janine, no.<eos> What happened?<eos> Nobody's telling me anything. What happened to Joey, Scotty?<eos> - What happened to my husband?<eos> - We don't know. We want you to be with the kids, OK?<eos> Hug them, tell them it's gonna be OK.<eos> We'll get someone to drive you back, OK?
Sure.<eos> Bring Anthony.<eos> He's staying with my sister for a little while.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah... Charlene's a little worried about you.<eos> Tell her I'm fine.<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah. - Your partner was just killed.<eos> You're not fine.<eos> I wanna put you with Ramirez.
You see this guy?<eos> He don't look Dominican, he look Puerto Rican.<eos> OK.<eos> I'm gonna ask you again.<eos> His name is manuel de Ia Cruz.<eos> I don't know these people.<eos> I don't know him.<eos> You don't know this guy either?<eos> Arnaldo Ruiz?<eos> -Because he says he knows you.
My nephew is no slouch either.<eos> Let me tell you how good a cop he is.<eos> He is, in my opinion, the best doughnut guy we ever had!<eos> And he was nice enough to give a ticket to an old girlfriend of mine.<eos> A chick who, sad to say, broke the D-man's heart.<eos> How much was that ticket?<eos> Oh, that's right, $250 for blocking the bus!<eos> Hey, Rocky, I'm sorry to hear about your brother, José, man.<eos> Just waiting until I clear my head some more, you feel me?<eos> I feel you, but look, the police came looking for you the other day.
The guys, um... they had a little cake, you know, and a little something for me down at the station. It was...<eos> It was real nice.<eos> OK, um... go back to sleep, huh.<eos> - I love you. - Good night, Dad.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> - OK, good night.<eos> Good night, pal.<eos> Olga.<eos> Olga.<eos> It's so good to see you.
Isabel... What you need is to talk to the priest.<eos> Just a simple blessing, Olga.<eos> I feel peace when I hear you pray.<eos> Father almighty Lord I bless you for allowing a baby to form in the womb of your daughter.<eos> help Isabel to guard this new life so no one can hurt it in any way.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Good-bye, Isabel.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Playboy, how much they pay you up in here?
So you obviously know more about me than I know about you.<eos> - I tell you what.<eos> - What's up?<eos> - This is what I need you to do.<eos> - What you need me to do?<eos> I need you to go to the police and tell them what happened between you and that little faggot cop, Cullen.<eos> Because you see right now they thinking that I'm the one that killed him.<eos> And you and me both know that that ain't what happened.<eos> If you came here to kill me, right? You better make sure you do a good job, homie.<eos> And that's the only thing I'ma tell you.
-l don't want to! -Please, please. -I don't want to go home!<eos> -Elisa, please.<eos> -l don't want to!<eos> -Okay, calm down. Okay.<eos> It's alright. It's alright.<eos> Come on.<eos> - So that's it?<eos> - That's it. And what about Jonathan Jones?<eos> We're just gonna let him off?<eos> Is your gut telling you he's our guy?
I mean that's the least I can do for you.<eos> I told you to make sure you do a good job.<eos> isabel?<eos> Everything okay?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Are you sure?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -You know that we love you, right?<eos> You know that I Iove you.<eos> I would never hurt you.
- Oh. - Yeah, my aunt and uncle.<eos> - Somebody should have called...<eos> - no, Lee.<eos> Lee, no.<eos> - What?<eos> What? - Donny got a job in Minnesota.<eos> - Like, a while ago.<eos> - Minnesota?<eos> Yeah, he got a job in some outfit in minnetonka, Minnesota, if you can believe that.<eos> - Joe didn't tell you about that?
You're breaking my neck!<eos> Lee?<eos> Yeah, hang on.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did you have a good time?<eos> - Yeah, really good.<eos> - Where's your mother?<eos> - They just left.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Yeah, she's sorry to miss you too.
Yeah, she's sorry to miss you too.<eos> Well, there's always next time.<eos> Did you get any sleep?<eos> Oh, yeah, it's so restful when my mother's here.<eos> Oh, too bad.<eos> Hi, kary.<eos> - Hi, daddy.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - Put me down.<eos> - I'm putting you down.
Hi, kary.<eos> - Hi, daddy.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - Put me down.<eos> - I'm putting you down.<eos> Relax. I'm just giving you a kiss.<eos> Honey, all right...<eos> Karen!<eos> Karen!<eos> - I almost dropped you on your head.
Uh, not that it would come up or anything, but her parents thinks she stays downstairs when she stays over. So if it comes up for some reason, can you just say she stayed in the downstairs room?<eos> - I don't even know them.<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> It's the mcganns.<eos> It's frank and pat mcgann.<eos> - Oh, that's silvie mcgann?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - So... Do you mind saying she stayed downstairs, like, if they call or something?<eos> Okay.<eos> Am I supposed to tell you to use a condom?
I figure it's okay.<eos> So I just keep goin' to the store.<eos> And, uh, that's it.<eos> Log must have rolled out onto the floor.<eos> Uh, fireman said they pulled randi out.<eos> She passed out downstairs.<eos> And, uh... and then the furnace blew, and they couldn't go back in again.<eos> And... That's all I remember.<eos> Okay, Lee, that's all for now.<eos> We'll... we'll call you if anything else comes up we want to ask you about.

- It's gotta be maintained.<eos> - I'm maintaining it.<eos> - I'm gonna maintain it.<eos> - You can't maintain it by yourself.<eos> Why not? It's my boat now, isn't it?<eos> 'Cause you're a minor, you can't take it out alone.<eos> I'm... I'm the trustee.<eos> - I gotta make the payments... - what does trustee mean?<eos> I gotta keep up the inspections.<eos> It means I'm in charge of handling everything for you until... does that mean you're allowed to sell the boat if I don't want you to?
- Yeah.<eos> Youknow, like,readyto pop.<eos> Oh, I didn't know that.<eos> Uh,I didn'tknow ifI shouldtellyou , but...<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Youwouldprobably decideitforyourself whenyouseeme.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So,uh,youknow, Ijustwantedtosay, youknow... actually, uh, i...<eos> oh, sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off. I just got to go.
I don't like her.<eos> I don't want her in the house right now.<eos> Why not? You don't even have to talk to her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Go to her house or call one of your friends.<eos> That's that.<eos> Would it be cool with your mom if I came over there?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I just don't like him bein' in the freezer!<eos> You've expressed that very clearly.<eos> I don't like it either.<eos> There's nothin' we can do about it.<eos> I'm just gonna sit here until you calm down.<eos> All right, I'm calmer now.<eos> Can you please just go away?<eos> No.<eos> Cool!<eos> How much are they payin' you?
We couldn't have lunch?<eos> I'm really sorry. I don't think so.<eos> I thank you for saying everything you said.<eos> You can't just die.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> But, honey... honey... and i...<eos> i want you to be happy. Honey, I see you walking around here, and I just want to tell you...<eos> I would want to talk to you, randi,
Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Cheese puffs?<eos> Hello, world!<eos> My name is Hank Thompson, and I've been stranded out on an island in the Pacific all alone!<eos> And this man, this man saved me from the brink of death when he allowed me to ride him like a jet ski, propelled by his f...<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe your... your gases built up from decomposition and maybe your soul leaving you?

I'm sorry.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hello.<eos> Help!<eos> Oh.<eos> You see that?<eos> There's gonna be people there.<eos> They're gonna feed us and take care of us.<eos> Everybody's gonna want to hear our story, and I'm gonna be all buff from carrying you around.
Don't worry about that.<eos> What's important is that we find a way to get home.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm trying to remember.<eos> What is home?<eos> This is from home.<eos> It's normally full of these things called cheese puffs.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, sometimes, um, your fingers would be coated in orange after eating it.<eos> And your mom probably told you to wash your hands, but I bet you'd just lick it off when she wasn't looking.
Uh, n...<eos> Well, that's...<eos> Normally when you go on a date with a girl, you'd take her to the theater to watch a movie, but when you're... when you're truly comfortable with someone, you stay at home and watch Netflix.<eos> Like, you and Jessie would probably stay at home together all the time, watching movies.<eos> You'd... You'd fall asleep on the couch, unless you were throwing one of your awesome parties.<eos> Then a few years later, you'd...<eos> you'd get married.<eos> You'd have a... a small wedding, nothing big, and... and you'd have twins, and you'd have to get a second job to pay the bills, but you wouldn't care, because... because you'd be going camping all the time with your family, and... and you'd tell her she looks even more beautiful with gray hairs.<eos> Manny.<eos> Manny, I think my love story is bringing you back to life!
She died shortly after.<eos> And so now, when you masturbate, you think about your mom.<eos> Ah, Manny, no.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Weird?<eos> Weird is like... when you do stuff that nobody else does, so they make fun of you for it.<eos> So when I say that I can't masturbate because it makes me think about my mom, people laugh at you.<eos> But that's fun.<eos> Making people laugh is great.<eos> It's not, because they call you names like Hanky Wanky, you have to change schools, and it's... it's not fun.
- Manny!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Hank, I'm so sorry.<eos> Please, let me try again.<eos> Do you have any idea what people back at home would think<eos> - if they saw me dressed like this?<eos> - Oh, but let me try one more time.<eos> Hank, please.<eos> But now that I've seen her, I can't get her out of my head, and I don't know if that's a thing that happens or if I'm just weird, but something tells me she is the one I'm supposed to bump into<eos> and spend the rest of my life with, and maybe if we can just find a way for me to remember her, then, bam, it'll all come rushing back to me, and the hairs on the back of my neck will stand up, and I can save you.
There are other people.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello, everybody.<eos> Buses are for people who don't know each other.<eos> They read books.<eos> They listen to music.<eos> - And we all sing songs together, right?<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, no, the other people will stare at you if you sing, so you listen to your own music.
Thank you.<eos> Sleep well.<eos> Morning, Hank.<eos> How'd you sleep?<eos> It's late.<eos> Better get a move on.<eos> Hank, thanks to you,<eos> I'm gonna get to see her soon... for real.<eos> I have this feeling, and I don't know what to call it.<eos> It's like I feel like even though I'm on top of you right now, touching you physically, there's something stuck in between us.
- Yeah.<eos> Heh.<eos> I have to pee.<eos> # I'm sitting on this rock #<eos> # Such a comfy rock #<eos> # Hank's gone to pee #<eos> # It is so nice here #<eos> # Nice and dark and warm #<eos> # Hank's gone... #<eos> Manny, I have something amazing to show you, but I need to tell you something first.

I understand.<eos> So I guess you're gonna die now.<eos> It really feels like it's my fault.<eos> No, Manny.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> I probably would have done it myself eventually.<eos> God knows I've tried, but there was always something there, some thought that was beautiful enough to keep me going.<eos> Maybe that's just something the brain invents to survive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like maybe your brain invented me to distract you from the fact that eventually your eyes are gonna stop blinking and your mouth will stop chewing and your blood will stop pumping... and then you're gonna shit yourself.
Oh, come on...<eos> - Manny, this is a bad idea!<eos> - No, it's a great idea.<eos> Manny, let go of me!<eos> Maybe you could finally talk to her, Hank.<eos> You can finally show her all the things we built for her and sing her the songs...<eos> Manny!<eos> Shut up!<eos> You don't know the real world, Manny.<eos> What if they meet you and they don't see what I see?
- Sir!<eos> Sir!<eos> Stop!<eos> - Hank!<eos> - Crissie!<eos> Crissie, come out right now!<eos> Sir, where are you going?<eos> I got you.<eos> Come on. Stay with me.<eos> I won't let them take you away.
Sir!<eos> Stop!<eos> - Hank!<eos> - Crissie!<eos> Crissie, come out right now!<eos> Sir, where are you going?<eos> I got you.<eos> Come on. Stay with me.<eos> I won't let them take you away.<eos> I won't let them take you to some morgue and bury you in some unmarked grave.
Hank, where are you?<eos> Sir, stop!<eos> Sir, you've gotta get out of the river.<eos> What is this?<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> They're gonna see everything.<eos> Crissie!<eos> I really screwed you up, didn't I?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to give you all the things in life that everyone else gets to have and all the things I thought I didn't deserve to have till I met you.
It's one of the best shampoos in Aachen.<eos> Anyway, it was really nice.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's fix a date next time and I'll have time.<eos> Right.<eos> Did you get caught?<eos> Don't!<eos> Move it.<eos> I don't think it's broken.<eos> I can't leave you like this.
Henneberg wants you to do the radical cut.<eos> I'm eating fruit, yes.<eos> But that had no basis.<eos> You know it was just speculation.<eos> And to sell such a big restructuring, I need even more details from Iliescu.<eos> This will annoy the feminist in you but Henneberg said Ms. Conradi has enough charm to manage Iliescu by herself.<eos> I'm not a feminist or I wouldn't tolerate guys like you, Gerald.<eos> I'll take that as a compliment.<eos> But Henneberg really believes in you.<eos> He wants to keep you here.
Pardon?<eos> Are you villing?<eos> Forget it.<eos> Fine.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> Sorry. I'll be right back.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> You want to ruin me or what?<eos> Dad, I'm talking to you.
I can deal with that.<eos> No problem.<eos> You sure about the two-masted boat?<eos> It'll be really hard work.<eos> For five of us?<eos> You can forget Daniel.<eos> He'll be in the bar, making drinks.<eos> Just send me a few pics.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll call you.
Why?<eos> So the maid hasn't come yet?<eos> Only Bogdan!<eos> Romanian lover for you!<eos> Can you sign this, please?<eos> Thank you very much. Enjoy.<eos> Great.<eos> Gerald found out about us, by the way.<eos> So what?<eos> He said not to fuck you too much so you don't lose your bite.

Enjoy.<eos> Great.<eos> Gerald found out about us, by the way.<eos> So what?<eos> He said not to fuck you too much so you don't lose your bite.<eos> I said, but that's why I fuck you.<eos> I want to fuck you in every corner of this room today.
I want you to hit one of the petit fours.<eos> I'll eat it afterwards.<eos> You're serious?<eos> Which one?<eos> Whichever you like.<eos> Green.<eos> I'm cumming.<eos> You're so stupid.<eos> Hi, Steph. It's Ines.<eos> Yeah, I know you're really busy. I'm sorry to disturb you.
Pretty long.<eos> That's nice.<eos> You're actually really fuckin' hot, you know?<eos> Well, you're a pretty cute kid yourself.<eos> It's gonna be 1,500.<eos> Oh, yeah, they took care of that.<eos> No, they didn't.<eos> I'm very sure they did.<eos> Dude, go down, go ask the manager.<eos> I promise you, they didn't.
We're gonna walk you up to the door, and you're gonna tell the dude to open up.<eos> If he opens up, cool.<eos> If not, I'm gonna blow your backbone outta your belly, period.<eos> Look, man, I don't know what...<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Motherfucker, you got blood on my Versace!<eos> - Oh, yeah, I feel you.<eos> - Goddamn it!<eos> Versace.<eos> Let me... Let me clean you up.
Keep walkin'.<eos> Y'all see this shit, right?<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Tell him to open up. - Hey!<eos> Hey, dude, it's me.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Tell him we won't bust him if he opens up.<eos> He ain't gonna believe that shit.<eos> Just humor me, tell him anyway.<eos> He said he wasn't gonna bust you if you open the door.
- Get movin'!<eos> - Get up, bro!<eos> - What did I say?<eos> - Where is it?<eos> It's upstairs!<eos> I said it was upstairs!<eos> - Let me waste a couple. - Don't!<eos> - You tryin' to fake me out?<eos> - No, I promise!<eos> I'm not fuckin' you around.
No, I didn't say you were crazy.<eos> Listen, please.<eos> I'm not a violent person.<eos> No, I understand that, I know.<eos> I just... I don't feel safe right now.<eos> And I don't feel safe and I have to leave now.<eos> Let's do this again real soon.<eos> Well, hey, I enjoyed the shit out of certain things.<eos> I wanna just honestly express my gratitude to you, Troy, for hookin' this little adventure up.<eos> Oh, boy, the buttering' up's underway to hit you up to loan him some money to buy somethin', Troy.
He's all right.<eos> - He's just a little baby.<eos> - I know.<eos> - He didn't, doesn't...<eos> - I know that.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> - Hey, hey! - Carmen!<eos> - You don't wanna go up there.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because your husband had one of his thugs watching' you, and he got shot.
Thickness of... 3.8 millimetres.<eos> That's very accurate.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Anything unusual about those measurements?<eos> It's a standard axe head sold in any DIY shop.<eos> But once they move the coffin, I can get in there and have a closer look.<eos> It's all much more crude and obvious than the Malton Hall incident.<eos> Find out if there's anyone else connected to the Lancaster family buried here.<eos> We need to know if there are other potential targets. Felix, my friend.<eos> Good to see you, Sonny.
But this is a sad time.<eos> Yep. Sad and grotesquely complicated.<eos> We'll find a way through.<eos> I promise.<eos> Mrs Lancaster.<eos> Good heavens! Sonny Desai.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Gregory's death was bad enough, but now this.<eos> It's all absolutely ghastly.<eos> Except for seeing you, of course.
Not for me.<eos> Can't stand the stuff.<eos> Felix? You don't know what you're missing, Craig.<eos> Thank you very much, Sonny.<eos> That's very generous of you.<eos> To Gregory.<eos> Dad.<eos> To Dad. To Gregory.<eos> It's such a shame you couldn't get home sooner, Felix.<eos> It would have meant such a lot to him to see you one last time.
You shouldn't be doing this, should you?<eos> - What?<eos> - Talking to me without him here.<eos> You know, I really love what I do, Naz.<eos> But every once in a while, I get frustrated.<eos> I abide by the rules, though, I do.<eos> So, yeah, that's right.<eos> You don't have to talk to me... unless you want to.<eos> You know... this is the most open-and-shut case I have had in a very long time.<eos> Everything is pointing to you.
Mother.<eos> Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?<eos> Gold.<eos> Good.<eos> It was always her color.<eos> I'm sorry for keeping you here.<eos> I shouldn't have, but I was--<eos> I didn't want to lose you again.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm glad to see you.
She's particularly interested in that aspect of what we do...<eos> She wasn't bad though.<eos> Any follow-ups?<eos> One.<eos> What about you?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> It's still early.<eos> I just don't want to end up at some pro bono shop.<eos> It's not like I want to be a lawyer anyway. You make them money...<eos> I saw you across the room and I wanna fuck you.

Are you pawning me off?<eos> No! OMG, you are mine!<eos> That was just getting good.<eos> No, you're gonna think it's creepy.<eos> Why?<eos> You're just...<eos> I'm just what?<eos> Show me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Seeing you in your real life, as a student, made me hard.
These are never driven because I guess the salt messes up the paint job in the winter time.<eos> But I guess in the summer, he takes them on road trips.<eos> Sorry, wait, this is him, I'll be right back.<eos> Hi!<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Just a friend from school.<eos> Yeah, we went out and had a few drinks.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I miss you.<eos> I can't wait to see you.
- Hi!<eos> - Hi.<eos> - So you're the um, the-uh roommate?<eos> - Yes. - Hi.<eos> Hi. - Hi, I'm-I'm Stacy.<eos> Sorry, I'm just-um, I have to go to work.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Um, we have bottled water.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Good... Um, I'm actually getting ready to go to work right now. Can I call you later?
- Did she leave? - Yes.<eos> Yeah, if you last that last-call kind of look.<eos> Am I gonna be seeing more of Stacy?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Then, yeah, she's great.<eos> She is. I need rent!<eos> Can your parents give me till the end of the week?<eos> Okay, I can ask.<eos> Here at XHP Technologies, a resource of rare cell research from across the globe...<eos> I'm gonna hold you to that...
Should I be Chelsea?<eos> You can be whoever you want to be.<eos> It'll be fun.<eos> - Hi...<eos> I missed you.<eos> - And you must be Chelsea. Hey.<eos> - Chelsea, hi.<eos> - Uh, this is Martin. - Chelsea, nice to meet you.<eos> Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> I wanted to tell you um, the downstairs bathroom is acting up and I wanted to call a plumber.
You know, I hate when people flaunt abnormally good genetics.<eos> God, I missed you idiots!<eos> Alright, everyone put down their plate, I got one more surprise.<eos> Ready?<eos> Come with me, let's go.<eos> Especially you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay, stop.<eos> Okay, Neil...<eos> I wanted to show you how much I appreciate you being there for me all these years.
It sounds like a dream.<eos> In dreams begin responsibilities.<eos> Delmore Schwartz.<eos> Wow, I can't believe I got a dealer who quotes Delmore Schwartz.<eos> Spectacular.<eos> We'll talk again soon.<eos> Wait, really, that's it?<eos> You're not gonna sell me the stuff?<eos> Oh, I never was.<eos> The red bastard will see you out.
You use me.<eos> You use my insecurities against me.<eos> You make me believe that I have all the power, but we both know it's always been you.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> And guess what?<eos> I can't believe that I ever let you think that your beauty was equal to my talents.<eos> I'm fucking brilliant and you're a quickly aging six.<eos> Maybe six and a half.<eos> You're what we would call a rapidly depreciating asset.<eos> I don't ever wanna see you again.
There's a booth in the back if you wanna sit with the crazies.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll bet you 10 bucks they're gonna puke before we do. - No, I'm not betting, quit it.<eos> - Come on, it's 10 bucks.<eos> - I'll give you odds, two to one.<eos> - I'm not betting. Come on, don't be a bitch.<eos> I'll give you odds, two to one.<eos> Dude, relax, all day with this bullshit.<eos> You're gonna fucking punch me right in the face.<eos> Yeah, I will punch you in the face.
Because you know there is no such thing.<eos> Nothing, it is a fallacy.<eos> Normality? Stability?<eos> It's a construct, a fantasy, you see through that.<eos> You see the truth.<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> I know all.<eos> I see all.<eos> Yet...<eos> I didn't expect to find you.
- What's your first name?<eos> - Robert.<eos> Office Robert Maldonado, fresh out of the academy. He goes into a crime scene and he comes out throwing up.<eos> And why shouldn't he?<eos> He's a new cop, just saw his first dead body.<eos> Now, Nasir Khan may very well be a human being, but so was Andrea Cornish, and so is Robert "Bobby" Maldonado.<eos> So you throwing up... absolutely, keep it in.<eos> Now, get out of here.<eos> So who's the lead on the Khan kid case?<eos> This concerns you, John, because...?
Your boss is too much. I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not sure what that means. You do.<eos> She took you with her when she stole my client.<eos> - She didn't steal anyone, Mr. Stone. She did.<eos> But I'm talking about you now.<eos> Is that what you went to law school for, to be a prop, Ms. Kapoor?<eos> Is there a message you'd like me to give Ms. Crowe?<eos> You know what the message is.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Can't take you.

Yeah, it's meat, but the best kind, veal.<eos> - Your people eat veal, right?<eos> - Sometimes.<eos> Ah, but only blessed, right?<eos> - I respect that.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Listen to you, all polite and shit.<eos> See, the reason it feels like silk is because from the day it's born, they keep it in a dark crate, so small they can't even turn around.<eos> And it stays there, half-blind in the dark, drinking baby formula, waiting to die.<eos> There are some bad people in here, but I could protect you.
Yo, you're my motherfucking hero.<eos> That makes me proud.<eos> Now give back whatever you stole.<eos> And apologize.<eos> Sorry, mister.<eos> I was just playin'.<eos> So, Ms. Rucker, what happened to you?<eos> You look all whitish now.<eos> Later, Ms. Rucker.<eos> Wish I met you back in the day.
It's behind you, Leo.<eos> Thirty-five yards back, 15 yards up.<eos> Down!<eos> Reason I'm so hard on you, son, like I am is someday I'd like to make you a partner.<eos> Yep. Oh, boy. Coming here from another country like you did.<eos> American dream is still alive.<eos> We love you, America.<eos> America is the greatest country in the world.<eos> We will now Purge.<eos> We will torture you and violate your flesh.
The looters I was telling you about.<eos> Purge Night, Senator. What did you expect?<eos> Hey, you old fuck!<eos> I'm back.<eos> And I brought some friends.<eos> And I'm gonna get that candy bar.<eos> They have chainsaws and they're coming inside.<eos> All right. I got to get you outta here.<eos> Yeah, but they're at both entrances.<eos> Then I'm gonna Purge by killing you and burning this bitch to the ground!
I give you Captain Jack Rackham.<eos> I can't be your wife, Jack.<eos> You and I are gonna be partners till they put us in the ground.<eos> That is the crown jewel taken from the good fortune prize.<eos> Her father's Lord Peter Ashe, governor of the Carolina Colony.<eos> Her father is a very influential man, he and I were friends.<eos> When you return her to her father, you're going to explain what it is you're trying to accomplish here.<eos> A Nassau that can self-govern.<eos> You are no longer a hostage.<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here.
He assured everyone he would be responsible for restoring the fort.<eos> The street comes to me with the problems it cannot solve for itself, and right now Jack is first among them.<eos> I know.<eos> Fuck's sake.<eos> I'll go talk to him.<eos> __<eos> Thank you, Celeste.<eos> I have no notes.<eos> Fuckin' leeches down there.<eos> You ain't careful, they're gonna bleed you dry.
Fuck's sake.<eos> I'll go talk to him.<eos> __<eos> Thank you, Celeste.<eos> I have no notes.<eos> Fuckin' leeches down there.<eos> You ain't careful, they're gonna bleed you dry.<eos> What man wouldn't, given the opportunity, purchase the adoration of the masses when the cost is so small?<eos> That mess is costing you 100 pound a day.<eos> Well, in about 800 years, you'll be able to say, "I told you so."

I stood between you and him, Jack.<eos> When Flint was ready to wage war against you over the gold, I was the one who said you would manage it as well as anyone could.<eos> For the good of this place, I was the one who said you could be trusted.<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you stand behind me in that moment?<eos> Because you and I had been through enough shit for you to know that I would do the same for you, that I have done the same for you, and would again without hesitation.<eos> I made a commitment to you, with you, to restore this place, to make it strong again.<eos> I see no other way to have it done.<eos> And I will have it done.<eos> I will move heaven and earth to have it done because I refuse to let you down.
I won't go to hospital!<eos> - I won't go!<eos> - Sign this release.<eos> - She said she called you.<eos> Answer. - You know how often she calls?<eos> Your mother is your responsibility.<eos> I'm ice cold.<eos> Can I have my mink?<eos> The firemen who tended to me was cute.<eos> I'll put you in a rest home for a bit.
What do you mean?<eos> Since when?<eos> There's nothing you can do?<eos> But...<eos> Yes...<eos> I'm going back to Paris.<eos> My mother hasn't eaten in 3 days.<eos> There's a train in an hour.<eos> - Can you drop me off?<eos> - It's not a ploy to get you back?
How are you?<eos> - Good, and you?<eos> - Very good.<eos> - How was the trip?<eos> He's over there.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hey there.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - And you?<eos> - I'm glad to see you.
- Good, and you?<eos> - Very good.<eos> - How was the trip?<eos> He's over there.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hey there.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - And you?<eos> - I'm glad to see you.<eos> - Me too. - Sorry, I couldn't pick you up. - No problem.
Take me back there.<eos> I want to go back.<eos> - He heard me.<eos> - Maybe. - Maybe he heard the wind.<eos> - He heard me.<eos> The past is already written.<eos> The ink is dry.<eos> What's in that tower?<eos> I want to go back there.<eos> I've told you many times, stay too long where you don't belong and you will never return.
I could boil your brain in gorilla hormones.<eos> I also have unorthodox options.<eos> For instance, I could have your soul put into the body of something taller.<eos> How comfortable are you with the serpent god Oxumaré?<eos> Not super comfortable.<eos> We'll stick to surgery, then!<eos> I'd like to think on it.<eos> What's there to think about?<eos> If B.B. King had come to me, he would have never died... at the height he was.<eos> The Carconi brothers are coming to tear you down.
I can climb up.<eos> Someone taught me how.<eos> Dad, get it together!<eos> Coming.<eos> Aaaah!<eos> You're here.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> It's what dads do.<eos> Even when their kid's a stupid shorty?<eos> Steve, there's something I have to show you.
- I didn't rape and kill anybody.<eos> Did I ask you that?<eos> What you got to do now is start walking like a man who's not afraid to look a man in the eye, only don't you ever look him in the eye 'cause you'll regret that.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> So, look and don't look someone in the eye? How am I supposed to do that?<eos> Like this.<eos> It's easy. You.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And when you fuck that up, and a man want to talk to you for motherfucking staring in their eye, you just be polite and respectful 'cause respect's all's anybody's got here.<eos> But if they still want to fuck with you, disrespect you, then you better stand your motherfucking ground, even if you got to get your ass beat.
- He tried to escape police custody.<eos> - What'd you hear? The deal.<eos> Man, 15 for that?<eos> Gift from the gods.<eos> I assume you took it.<eos> Jack and soda.<eos> Oh, hey, John.<eos> Heard about your kid.<eos> What a gift from the gods.<eos> Small money's gonna tell you, "Take the plea."
- Yeah.<eos> See, you're talking about explaining the situation.<eos> Hulka said this is a crazy drug dealer named Cheddar.<eos> So?<eos> What's so scary about "Cheddar"?<eos> Cheddar is a psychopath name.<eos> You only name yourself something adorable if you can back it up.<eos> - I don't think that's a thing.<eos> - That's a thing.<eos> If you meet a guy named Fluffy Pink Bunny Head, he will stab you in the eye.
Wait.<eos> Are you...<eos> Keanu Reeves?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm your spirit teacher.<eos> People can't be excellent to you unless you're being excellent to yourself.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Clarence, it's time to wake up.<eos> Where you go from there is a choice I leave to you.
Now, I know y'all ain't gonna turn down 20 G's.<eos> I mean, shit.<eos> That's a lot of money even by Allentown standards, right?<eos> Well...<eos> Let me tell you about Allentown standards.<eos> By Allentown standards, when a nigga make a deal,<eos> a nigga make a goddamn deal.<eos> Ooh... Shark...<eos> And didn't nobody say nothing about no exchange tomorrow.<eos> So, let me tell you how it's gonna go down.
Hulka.<eos> Look, come on, man...<eos> Kill this motherfucker.<eos> - What?<eos> No!<eos> Come on, man!<eos> - Kill him?<eos> Like, end his life so the motherfucker expires?<eos> Take the soul out of his body?<eos> But we can't do that, and I'll tell you why.
Stay in the car.<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> Well, this was a fuckin' mess.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Hey, I know you need this back.<eos> He's keepin' his.<eos> - Rell.<eos> - You're doing good work.<eos> We need to talk about a few things before you go.<eos> But first let me introduce you to Officer Galloway and Officer Dunn.
Help me!<eos> Help me!<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Yo, kill it!<eos> Kill it!<eos> It hurts so bad, you don't even know.<eos> Hasn't even been that bad, really.<eos> Clarence and I, having killed the Allentown brothers has us kind of lookin' like crime heroes or somethin'.<eos> We don't even have to change our voice or anything.<eos> Mostly it's just good to see you.
I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I apologize.<eos> That's my wife, though.<eos> That was a love pound.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Thanks for watching him.<eos> No problem.<eos> He's like one of the family.<eos> I do have some news for you, though.
- Of course, it's fucking on.<eos> - Good cause I don't wanna miss my queue.<eos> What the fuck are you gonna do?<eos> High kick your way in there..? With the fucking top hat and cane?<eos> - And plus, it's my queue, ok?<eos> - Whatever.<eos> I'm just ready, you know?<eos> And I want Vern to know that.<eos> Vern doesn't give two fucks about what you want.<eos> Verny can't even see you. You're that small.
- Whatever.<eos> I'm just ready, you know?<eos> And I want Vern to know that.<eos> Vern doesn't give two fucks about what you want.<eos> Verny can't even see you. You're that small.<eos> Plus you need to wash them knuckles, or they are gonna get infected.<eos> Fuck man.<eos> You like John Denver?<eos> - I must admit I never tire looking at it.<eos> - I never tire looking at you doll.
I'm fucking grieving here.<eos> I'm coming for you, man.<eos> I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.<eos> You fuckin try, you cocksucker.<eos> - Cover me. I need to come over.<eos> - Fine, Vernon.<eos> - We need to strategize.<eos> You still collecting the pension, Frank?<eos> Fuck off..<eos> Alright, I'll mark you as present on the roster.
Wooden boxes don't stop bullets.<eos> College fees, the medical bills.<eos> Plus Rita left me.<eos> I hooked up with this Asian chick.<eos> She cleaned me out.<eos> Howard, I am gonna stack the bodies of your eleven children on top of each other.<eos> And burn them onto your lawn if you don't tell me who hired you right now.<eos> Tell us, Howard.<eos> It's good. It's good.<eos> That's what I'm paying you for.
Tell him I'm sorry.<eos> Oi, here, Leary.<eos> Leary, up here, boy.<eos> Ah, fucker.<eos> Come on there, big man.<eos> Fuck off, you freak of nature.<eos> - Stay the fuck down.<eos> - Ah fuck.<eos> I'll get you home Frank.<eos> Don't worry. I'll get you home.
- Sorry.<eos> - Don't you move.<eos> What the fuck are you doing, old man?<eos> I'll fucking shoot you.<eos> Don't you fucking touch me.<eos> Fucking pussy.<eos> What are you going to do now, huh? Huh?<eos> You better fucking stop!<eos> Don't hurt me.<eos> I'll kill you, man!
I can smell spring in the air.<eos> My other two were winter babies.<eos> I haven't had a spring one, not till this little afterthought.<eos> Little accident, more like.<eos> - We'll manage. - Mm.<eos> - Always have. It's like we used to say when we had to get married and live with your mum and dad.<eos> - "Let's look at what we've got. " BOTH: - "Not what we've not got. "<eos> Give us a kiss, Rhoda.<eos> And that's your lot!<eos> Should've said that to you nine months ago!
Can I just be by myself with her?<eos> We'll be right outside the door.<eos> Oh, love.<eos> What a mess.<eos> What a mess, eh?<eos> We'll sort something out.<eos> I promise.<eos> Cos you're mine.<eos> Mine.<eos> And I'm not bailing out on you.
Do not remove them.<eos> The entire creation is hanging in the balance.<eos> 'I'm sorry, Pats. '<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Delia, you're 24!<eos> When I said that to my mother, she said,<eos> "And it's only by the grace of God you'll see 25."<eos> If I come back to live in London it will break her.<eos> I owe her so much and she's fighting so hard.<eos> Well, can I see you before you go?

They expect to be in discomfort, even pain, because they haven't been taught that owning a female body ought to be a joy!<eos> But it so often isn't, Nurse Franklin.<eos> - That's what our work's about.<eos> - And it shouldn't have to be!<eos> This morning I spent time with a patient who - with all due respect - is nearer your generation than mine.<eos> And her experience isn't one that we need to see repeated.<eos> I'm sorry, Sister.<eos> No, Nurse Franklin.<eos> I am.<eos> She looks a bit like you, Perry.
You heard the nurse.<eos> Get out.<eos> What you talking about?<eos> Mrs Beckett -- that's not what...<eos> This ain't your business!<eos> My blood pressure's all cos of you.<eos> You ain't, you ain't making no sense.<eos> I got another life in here.<eos> I can only carry this, my baby.<eos> I can't carry you an' all.
- Of course you have!<eos> It must've brought back so many awful memories.<eos> I so wanted to let you comfort me.<eos> But I didn't know how to do it with the others there.<eos> Patsy, if me being here makes you uncomfortable, I can go.<eos> - I'm sure I'd find somewhere...<eos> - No!<eos> I don't want that.<eos> I want you here.<eos> I nearly lost you once already.
Hot water, whenever you need it.<eos> Space for a fridge.<eos> You don't even need to take the rubbish out - you just drop it down a chute.<eos> And think how easy it would be to clean.<eos> No need to scrub those poor hands till they bleed.<eos> I'm always going to have it, aren't I?<eos> Meg... I know what typhoid can cost a family.<eos> I really do.<eos> Your family didn't lose Jeanette.<eos> Please don't let them lose you.
♪ Waitin' at the church Waitin' at the church<eos> ♪ When I'd found you'd left me in the lurch<eos> ♪ Lord, how it did upset me!<eos> ♪<eos> I've come to enquire about Baby Cottingham.<eos> Baby Cottingham?<eos> The very... poorly baby that was born this evening.<eos> We've had two admissions today, but none since noon.<eos> Can you hear me, little one?<eos> And the Lord who created you said "Don't be afraid, for I have redeemed you.
But to leave it alone?<eos> Cold, and trembling, and possibly in pain?<eos> The anaesthetic from the mother should still be in its system.<eos> It shouldn't suffer.<eos> And it cannot live.<eos> But it's living now.<eos> And it has been for an hour or more.<eos> Sister, this was the kinder way.<eos> We couldn't even tell whether it was male or female.<eos> May the Lord bless you and keep you.
Well, why would there be?<eos> Until somebody, somewhere, tells us otherwise, we have to look at this as a local phenomenon.<eos> A local problem.<eos> Which means it's our problem.<eos> There's no need to keep hiding your hand.<eos> You got a ring on your finger.<eos> - It's not a wedding ring, though.<eos> I'm actually rubbing my back.<eos> I'm all achy at the bottom of it.<eos> They won't want to see you for a month once you're all booked in.
It happened after Hiroshima and Nagasaki too.<eos> We did it in History.<eos> So World War II is history now, is it?<eos> We do exams in it and everything.<eos> Can I wash some equipment?<eos> - How much are you charging?<eos> - The usual.<eos> - Bike fund? - Yes.<eos> Go through to the sluice.<eos> I'll catch you up.
Or what love wants.<eos> One way or another, things end up how they should.<eos> You need to have the big light on if you're going to do handicrafts at this hour.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's only a few figures for the Bible Study Fuzzy Felt at Sunday School.<eos> Judas and Simon Peter have gone missing, and Mary Magdalene's got no head.<eos> I hope Mr Hereward appreciates your dedication.<eos> I don't care if he doesn't.<eos> Enter.<eos> Barbara, may I speak to you for a moment?
(Whichever you think best.)<eos> He'll come round.<eos> He just needs to cool off.<eos> I'm giving up.<eos> Do you hear me, Tim?<eos> I am giving up.<eos> Do you promise?<eos> Yes.<eos> With all my heart.<eos> So I never want to see you with a cigarette again.
Do you promise?<eos> Yes.<eos> With all my heart.<eos> So I never want to see you with a cigarette again.<eos> Now, you promise me, Tim.<eos> Put your hand on your heart and you promise me.<eos> I promise.<eos> You are my only son.<eos> My only son.<eos> And I never, ever want to lose you.
Denis ain't laid a finger on me.<eos> Rosie, this don't make no sense to me.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> It's different now.<eos> How?<eos> When he don't lump you or treat you bad?<eos> - Why are you walking out on it?<eos> - Cos I need to be good enough.<eos> So very, very good for that life now, and I ain't.<eos> It's a charmed life you've been living if you've got time for thoughts like that, I tell you.
It does all smell rather musty.<eos> And there's mould in this billycan.<eos> Oh, it just needs a quick swill in some hot water.<eos> This holiday is about getting back to nature and being together as a family.<eos> We'll enjoy it, won't we?<eos> Yes, we will.<eos> Because we've earned it.<eos> I love you. I love you, Michael.<eos> But you're going to kill me.<eos> We did the right thing putting you on iron tablets.
I can bear more than I ever thought I could.<eos> And I can bear it for others, because my strength is a gift from Him.<eos> I can tell the truth, and not be ashamed.<eos> It's like singing.<eos> EVERY voice counts.<eos> Aren't you going to look at him?<eos> He's beautiful, Diane.<eos> I've already got three little brothers.<eos> He's your son.<eos> I could've killed you.
It's swaying.<eos> The whole block of flats is actually swaying.<eos> Is it?<eos> - You all right?<eos> - I dunno.<eos> I've got an headache and a pain here -- under my ribs.<eos> Shall I clear off out?<eos> Get the kids from under your feet?<eos> You can't go walking up and down the towpath in this wind!<eos> I should be taking you back to that little hospital - or even just fetch that nurse.
We might not even have three days!<eos> The ship was delayed at Cape Town and by the time they dock, Noelle might have given birth!<eos> Well, under the circumstances, no-one will condemn her, or the child.<eos> It will still be a bastard.<eos> Mum!<eos> I want them married the minute that boat docks.<eos> My goodness, young Lenny, you are filling out nicely!<eos> Have you got bricks in your pockets?<eos> Marbles? Hm!<eos> Well, must be all that extra milk we're getting into you.
Five minutes to gather my thoughts before Compline!<eos> That's all I ask - and what do I get?<eos> Conversations about nylons and sauce bottles being banged like it's going out of fashion!<eos> Sorry, Sister Evangelina.<eos> I take it we can't tempt you to a savoury snack?<eos> Oh! Morning, Tessie!<eos> I heard about Mitchell's fiancee.<eos> Oh, bless the girl, coming all that way across the world!<eos> Love knows no boundaries.<eos> - Who told YOU?
I take it we can't tempt you to a savoury snack?<eos> Oh! Morning, Tessie!<eos> I heard about Mitchell's fiancee.<eos> Oh, bless the girl, coming all that way across the world!<eos> Love knows no boundaries.<eos> - Who told YOU?<eos> - Mr Ballard at the stationer's.<eos> And he said you was in yesterday, ordering wedding invitations.<eos> Yes.<eos> And today, I've come to you to order two dozen nappy pins, two dozen terry squares, six pairs of plastic pants, a heavy-duty sanitary belt and a packet of maternity towels.
There are some houses I go to where I have to wear bicycle clips to stop the fleas going up my trouser legs.<eos> And yet people try so hard.<eos> It's almost always the landlord's fault.<eos> Where there are bad drains, there are rats, and where there are rats, there are fleas.<eos> - Or bed bugs.<eos> Bed bugs can really sink their teeth in when you're sitting with the dying.<eos> And on that romantic note, where are we going to go this evening?<eos> I have it on good authority that the Palace Picture House was fumigated just last week.<eos> I don't want to go to the cinema tonight.<eos> I want to talk to you.
Downloaded from DayT.se<eos> This marks the end of a long and painful chapter for the people of Libya, who now have the opportunity to determine their own destiny in a new and democratic Libya.<eos> Warring gangs continue to raid. Gaddafi's abandoned armories as a battle rages in Libya's two largest cities.<eos> It's loaded.<eos> - How's the team here?<eos> - Good.<eos> Three ex-Marines, one ex-Army Ranger.<eos> It's nice having another team guy around.<eos> Good to see you, brother.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> But there's a few we got our eyes on, so always stay strapped.<eos> Damn kids!<eos> This is the bathroom.<eos> This is you.<eos> That's me.<eos> This curtain is meant to discourage you from spooning with me.
Uh-oh.<eos> I rode bitch last week.<eos> She's a little spicy.<eos> Oz, Tig, limo.<eos> Boon, Tanto, follow.<eos> You?<eos> I drive.<eos> Hey, Jack, this is Sona, she's an American who grew up in France, which makes her really friendly.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Careful, Jack, I think she's flirting with you.
Including the one talking to you right now.<eos> You see that, dude?<eos> There's guys on those rocks over there.<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> Your eyes are playing tricks, man.<eos> No. I'm okay.<eos> Tig, take a break.<eos> Hey, Tig.<eos> Go on down, man.<eos> I'll spell you.
Building C, up top!<eos> We gonna exfil now?<eos> Get us to Tripoli, brother, I'll get you wasted.<eos> I'm the Commander of the Libyan Shield.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Sir, we're tasked with sensitive document destruction.<eos> - Not a moment too soon.<eos> - Hey, Glen! Anyone call an airport limo?<eos> What's up, brother Bub?<eos> Good to see you, brother.
Good to see you, brother.<eos> Sorry I'm late. I got hung up in the gift shop.<eos> Oh. You guys made a mess up here.<eos> Would've waited for you, but people crying and dying over the radio, man.<eos> We didn't have the heart for it.<eos> Hey, Rone, I'd like to tell you it's over, but it isn't.<eos> The 24 CIA staffers here, plus five State guys, plus six GRS, plus us.<eos> I get it. Too many. There's no room in the jet.<eos> You think you can hold things down here for a few more hours?<eos> I'll tell you what.
Yeah, kid.<eos> That's what I'm talkin' about.<eos> Yo, you see this? Damn!<eos> Yo! You wasn't supposed to kill nobody, man!<eos> I had to make a move, Dante.<eos> Shit went left.<eos> My bad.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, fuck. God.<eos> Shut up, Chico, before I gag you with your panties.
Why don't you... ponder me another cosmo?<eos> Luke.<eos> Hey, Candace.<eos> You got promoted?<eos> Dante's out sick.<eos> You okay?<eos> Table seven wants six bottles of Ace of Spades.<eos> I need you to help me carry them up.<eos> I don't like being up there by myself.<eos> I'm right behind you.
Seagate wasn't shit.<eos> So... what can I do for you?<eos> It's the other way around.<eos> Y'all got hit last night.<eos> That expensive, exclusive, hard-to-get hardware that Diamondback gave you is in a police evidence lockup.<eos> And the money... that Domingo and his crew were supposed to give you... is gone.<eos> I'm with Diamondback now.<eos> You knew that, right?<eos> Well, tell Diamondback, it's about time... Uh-uh...<eos> Diamondback tells you.
Well, tell Diamondback, it's about time... Uh-uh...<eos> Diamondback tells you.<eos> I'm his number one seller.<eos> I ain't here to spank you.<eos> But I do need to look you in your eyes...<eos> Was it an inside job?<eos> Hell no.<eos> I needed that money, too.<eos> It took forever to build up that kind of trust.<eos> We're here to get you back on your feet.
Mr. Stokes.<eos> Mr. Stokes.<eos> That's important.<eos> Never Cottonmouth.<eos> All right, okay, my bad.<eos> After what happened with Dante, we circling the wagons.<eos> They after us, B.<eos> Who?<eos> Nigga, it don't matter who.<eos> Mr. Stokes wanted me to check on you... personally.
Only thing worse than a thief is a damn liar.<eos> Where's... my... money?<eos> You left Dante alive.<eos> He called Tone.<eos> And with his dying words, gave up you and your homeboy.<eos> We got your money.<eos> Now you're gonna tell us where Chico is so we can get the rest.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now I can hit you like a man.
Those thugs shake people down?<eos> They work for Mariah or Cottonmouth?<eos> A little bit of both.<eos> They related?<eos> - Aunt and nephew?<eos> - Cousins.<eos> Their grandma was Mama Mabel.<eos> Who's Mama Mabel?<eos> The devil's ex-wife.<eos> They ever come at you sideways?
I'm coming by the club tonight.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought you said you don't want to be seen there.<eos> I don't.<eos> But I like the music.<eos> I'm going to be on you until this is resolved.<eos> It's getting resolved.<eos> You best believe that.<eos> - You ain't gonna fire that.<eos> - I'll kill you.
- You ain't gonna fire that.<eos> - I'll kill you.<eos> Shameek is dead.<eos> They have his half of the money.<eos> Now they want yours.<eos> - Shameek is dead? - Yeah.<eos> Well, good.<eos> Then you just want my money for yourself, don't you?<eos> I couldn't care less.<eos> I came here because Pop asked me to come for you.
Why does everybody bring him up?<eos> He was never there for me.<eos> I'm sick and tired of hearing about him.<eos> Pop thinks he has a way to clear this mess up.<eos> I know you didn't kill Dante... or Shameek.<eos> All you guys wanted was the cash.<eos> It was an inside job.<eos> Dante's safe idea.<eos> Look...<eos> I found you in four hours for free.
Well, I got a half a million new chances is the way I see it.<eos> Tell Pops... I'm sorry.<eos> He was always good to me.<eos> He deserves better.<eos> Took your rook, rookie.<eos> - It's your move, son. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Don't get scared now. - Oh, no, no, no...<eos> Want some catfish with that hot sauce?<eos> You count calories, Power Man?<eos> Fork will kill you quicker than any bullet.
Ah, he's a little bit of everything.<eos> Not a very good judge of character.<eos> He's got a big heart.<eos> We should fault him for that?<eos> Gimme a second.<eos> And don't start without me.<eos> Can't do the one-two punch without you.<eos> Turk.<eos> Misty.<eos> I'm surprised to see you this far uptown.
Can't do the one-two punch without you.<eos> Turk.<eos> Misty.<eos> I'm surprised to see you this far uptown.<eos> I'm mostly Midtown nowadays, you know?<eos> Puffy ain't got shit on me, baby.<eos> I'm the real bad boy worldwide.<eos> Yeah, your rap sheet got so many hits, your record could put out a record.<eos> Hey, I just fell through to see my man, Bobby Fish, and to play some chess.<eos> Well, you need to fall your ass back downtown, 'cause if I catch you around here again... it's gonna be checkmate.
- No... I don't think so.<eos> Luke, check.<eos> Five-O!<eos> You need to go in the bathroom and hide.<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> - Hey, Misty.<eos> - Fish.<eos> - How you doin'?<eos> - Good to see you.
What's wrong, Shades?<eos> - You should've waited.<eos> - Waited?<eos> Bump that noise.<eos> I got the call.<eos> It was me.<eos> What happened?<eos> Look, Turk calls me.<eos> Tells me he saw Chic at the shop, slippin'.<eos> I came and ask you if it was important if the nigga was breathing.
Pops is dead.<eos> A casualty of war.<eos> You know... Shit happens.<eos> Where's my money?<eos> How the hell did you get up here?<eos> I'm Turk Barrett, baby.<eos> The door ain't been built yet that can hold me back.<eos> Now, where's my money?<eos> Okay, Mr. Barrett.<eos> Tone promised to pay you for finding Chico, right?
Step off.<eos> Before you get hurt.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm just getting started.<eos> Good to know.<eos> How's the job search coming?<eos> Dishwasher.<eos> I saw you standing out there earlier.<eos> I wasn't ready to come in yet.<eos> Yeah, I hear you on that.
"Oh, shit, there's no way I'm splitting that three ways." So... Boom!<eos> Now it's a two-way split instead of three.<eos> Shameek gets caught with his share of the cash.<eos> - By Cottonmouth, I'm assuming. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Who?<eos> - "Who?"<eos> - Cottonmouth.<eos> The man you stole from.<eos> Dante's former boss.<eos> The man who shot up Pop's Barber Shop and killed a good man trying to get at you.
Would you call that nothing?<eos> And all that's on me?<eos> Why don't y'all find Pop's killer instead of being all up in my business?<eos> Your business and our investigation are one and the same.<eos> You know where I live.<eos> You wanna work some things out, hmm?<eos> We can always do it there.<eos> You can even bring handcuffs this time.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> Cottonmouth ain't trying to kill you.
Watch the tofu supreme!<eos> And watch the hair!<eos> This takes time.<eos> It's too much product.<eos> Damn.<eos> You can't really appreciate this place till the lights are on.<eos> Fall back, Zip.<eos> Domingo's right.<eos> When the lights are on... you really can see things for what they are.<eos> - I got some verdad for you. - Hmm.
You can't really appreciate this place till the lights are on.<eos> Fall back, Zip.<eos> Domingo's right.<eos> When the lights are on... you really can see things for what they are.<eos> - I got some verdad for you. - Hmm.<eos> We got hit.<eos> And it was you.<eos> You didn't have to send no mercs to break up my organization.<eos> I think somebody's pulling your chain... and using my name to do it.<eos> 'Cause if my people were to hit you, you'd be dead.
You really wanna be in the middle of all this?<eos> And for what? For a chicken banquet dinner and a photo with the mayor as a reward?<eos> - Hell, no. - Wow.<eos> You are a credit to the badge, Scarfe.<eos> Hello.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Where?<eos> We'll be there.<eos> - It has to be you. - Uh-huh.<eos> I'll pick you up out front.
Who do you think's gonna move the rubble?<eos> You?<eos> You think they can get to us?<eos> If they can't get to us, we gonna have to get to them.<eos> How?<eos> Okay, Connie.<eos> The best way I can put this is... I'm kind of strong.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Hey, you wanna play?<eos> Hey, man, I'm talking to you.
That's not the lane I want to play in.<eos> You must smell a lot of shit having your ass on your shoulders all the time. I make you an easy offer, throw in some perks, and you just shrug 'em off.<eos> Well, it's lucky I'm a patient man.<eos> Smart enough to know you'd say no.<eos> Gave me time to build a backup plan.<eos> Squabbles, put down that shiv!<eos> You don't fight, I tear your little world apart, starting with your homie Squabbles.<eos> Get down! Get down!<eos> Stay seated! Stay seated!<eos> Look at me when I'm talking to you.
- You got him now.<eos> Lay him up. - Sending the fights out?<eos> Yeah! Welcome to the Internet.<eos> That's how you finish!<eos> Oh, yeah, he ain't gettin' up.<eos> Smart move with the hair.<eos> Nothin' to grab.<eos> I'm still mad at you for picking Jet Li over Bruce Lee.<eos> Well, take it out on these bastards then.<eos> Keep him off of you.
Didn't your old man come up on the Mets?<eos> He got cut.<eos> He played for the championship New York Nines team.<eos> That's a Nine's ring?<eos> Zip, please.<eos> That's my father's!<eos> Don't cry.<eos> You mad?<eos> Holler at Luke Cage.<eos> He'll tell you why we doin' this.
Just be the best man that you can be.<eos> And always make sure they spell your name right.<eos> Now, that's a dapper approach, man.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> - Appreciate it.<eos> Let's see here.<eos> That ain't no smock.<eos> - You ready for later? - All good.<eos> Messages stacked up at the door.<eos> Like everybody in Harlem looking for you after that building thing.
Somebody's gotta protect his legacy.<eos> Even if he won't.<eos> Let me get into this.<eos> See what the hell's going on.<eos> Get into it?<eos> You need to check these dudes!<eos> Everybody heard about what you did in the projects.<eos> Don't be a punk and just stand by.<eos> Different kind of chess gambit.<eos> Cottonmouth figures if he can't drop you, he'll get Harlem to push you out.
- I work hard for that money.<eos> I'm on it!<eos> Hey, you're late.<eos> What?<eos> I got robbed.<eos> Some guy stole my bag.<eos> I had to whoop his ass.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> I was thinking that I wanted my bag back.<eos> He could have killed you.
Either be a part of the solution or leave.<eos> I will.<eos> I'll leave.<eos> But first, I gotta do right by Pop.<eos> - You going to Pop's memorial?<eos> Don't.<eos> You need to let this go.<eos> It makes you look weak.<eos> I can't ignore him.<eos> You can't let this dude drive you stupid.
It's called fate.<eos> That's Carl Lucas.<eos> I did time with him at Seagate Prison when I first got there.<eos> Rackham, captain of the guards, he had us work him over real good.<eos> There's no way he could've survived in one piece.<eos> This nigga's half Houdini, half Ali.<eos> There's a bullet for everyone.<eos> Diamondback taught me that.<eos> Say what?<eos> I got something to show you.
I'd be doin' a lot better if people would stop starin' at me like I'm dirty.<eos> What do you know, Detective?<eos> Scarfe must have told you something.<eos> There's evidence that guns from the junkyard shoot-out were in that warehouse.<eos> Stolen from our evidence locker?<eos> Your partner is my top suspect.<eos> It doesn't mean Scarfe did it.<eos> He probably got a lead, and went to go and check it out.<eos> Alone.<eos> Without pulling you in on a single detail.
Put the word out on the street.<eos> A hundred large for Detective Scarfe.<eos> I want him dead.<eos> Dead.<eos> Dead.<eos> Look for a green van.<eos> Plate's 69-somethin'.<eos> We're near the barber shop.<eos> We'll head that way.<eos> Bring him to you or Mr. Stokes?
They just made it official an hour ago.<eos> But you had nothing to do with Scarfe.<eos> My shop, my watch.<eos> All right, here we go.<eos> You've got to play this smart, Detective.<eos> IA's gonna be up your ass with a flashlight.<eos> I can handle Ridley.<eos> She was my lieutenant at the 31st.<eos> Listen, you still have a future here, Misty.<eos> My advice to you is to let go of this board and everyone you have pinned on it.
That's what you think's about to happen?<eos> 'Cause last time I checked... you were no longer a sheriff...<eos> Carl.<eos> You ain't doing much of anything.<eos> Carl Lucas.<eos> That's a square-ass name, man.<eos> Oh, if my mama named me that, I'd change my name to Luke Cage, too.<eos> See...<eos> I don't know shit about going to prison.<eos> But I figure if you escaped, faked your death, and all that other slick shit, eventually it's bound to catch up with you.
You're not special.<eos> Instead of running, if you make a move and you take him down once and for all?<eos> You stop him, you save this community, and you free yourself.<eos> Or...<eos> Turn up the bass.<eos> I ain't one to apologize.<eos> Then don't.<eos> But I was feeling myself a little earlier.<eos> My bad.<eos> I ain't mean to come at you like that.
You done good.<eos> You done good.<eos> Hey. HD, Blu-ray, I got all the best angles of the incident.<eos> I got everybody in here.<eos> You know you want to see it.<eos> - People actually pay money for that?<eos> - Yo. It's you!<eos> You one of them! - No.<eos> Come on, let's talk.<eos> My man's got a RED, next time you do something, I could film you.
I'm guessing that's you.<eos> I guess you guys haven't heard about me, have you?<eos> Take him out.<eos> I'm about sick of always having to buy new clothes.<eos> Where are the guns?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The ones you got back from Cottonmouth. The ones my friends died over.<eos> What, you think you can go after everyone?<eos> I kinda do.<eos> I can pick you up... walk you over to the bridge... and throw your ass in the Hudson.
She sent me away to keep me away from Pete!<eos> You know damn well what that woman made me do.<eos> I was 14 years old.<eos> Uncle Pete betrayed us.<eos> Uncle Pete was the only one who ever had my back.<eos> Mama Mabel was always sheltering you, protecting you.<eos> And for what?<eos> All that education, and you just as shady as me.<eos> Me protected?<eos> All I did your whole life was protect you!
On the record.<eos> Tell me everything you have and end it.<eos> Right here.<eos> I'm not going to do that, Misty.<eos> - Then that makes you an accessory.<eos> - To what?<eos> After what happened this morning, you expect me to trust the system?<eos> - The system is not your enemy.<eos> - Really?<eos> How's the system been treating you lately?
I can't keep running.<eos> But I want you to know what you're getting into.<eos> If Cottonmouth talks, or if anybody connects the dots that Luke Cage is Carl Lucas... I go back to Seagate.<eos> You knew the risks and you did it anyway.<eos> That's what makes you a hero.<eos> Maybe I should get a mask after all.<eos> Too much in Harlem happens in the shadows.<eos> People fear what they can't see.<eos> And that's what makes you different.<eos> They see you.

He's discreet.<eos> What the hell did you do that for?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - No hospitals.<eos> - I can't be in the system.<eos> - He borrowed it.<eos> Like I said, he's discreet.<eos> But you bleeding out in the back of a gypsy cab?<eos> That would get even more attention.<eos> We need to keep you safe.
You don't have any friends.<eos> "A man of too many friends comes to ruin, but there is a friend who comes closer than a brother."<eos> Proverbs 18:24.<eos> Cornell Stokes was that friend for me.<eos> And I could trust him like I could my own brother.<eos> Cornell was losing it.<eos> You trusted me to take care of him.<eos> I trusted you to take care of it, not him.<eos> What?<eos> Did you think I was just gonna give it all to you?
He did. But he OD'd.<eos> And then Jazzy ran off.<eos> She told me, "I'm not ready to be nobody's mama."<eos> And she just left.<eos> She left you, and there you were, wrapped in a blanket in a basket.<eos> Mama Mabel put you in my hands that very day.<eos> You always thought I called you Mo for Cottonmouth.<eos> Mo was for Moses.<eos> I wasn't ready to be nobody's mama, neither.<eos> I tried to protect you from yourself... but I didn't.
Jacques Alef with the Macoute...<eos> Neville Barnwell with the Yardies.<eos> Juan Carlos Castro with the Cubanos...<eos> And the Chinese, they got their own thing going on downtown, but Peter Hong with the Koreans... he might wanna holla.<eos> When?<eos> That's gonna take me a few days.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Abalone shells.<eos> Claire. Claire.<eos> Everybody's looking for you.
And the Chinese, they got their own thing going on downtown, but Peter Hong with the Koreans... he might wanna holla.<eos> When?<eos> That's gonna take me a few days.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Abalone shells.<eos> Claire. Claire.<eos> Everybody's looking for you.<eos> How did you not get caught?<eos> He shot you again?<eos> Why in the hell is this guy trying to kill you so bad?
I can help.<eos> Why me?<eos> Why did you pick me?<eos> Because you were strong.<eos> Stronger than most.<eos> That's not what Reva said.<eos> She said she begged you to do it.<eos> There's more to it than that, and you know it.<eos> She begged me, but you were already tabbed for the program.<eos> -Didn't Reva tell you about this?
Like I said, ready as ever.<eos> You need to understand where you are here.<eos> If they sense any weakness, any hesitation... you're not just done politically... you're done permanently.<eos> You're late.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Looks like I'm right on time.<eos> Wagwan?<eos> Now that my cousin is gone, I'm making a few changes.<eos> I loved my cousin, but I didn't like what he did.<eos> Until he stopped serving you.
-Don't bother.<eos> Just by being here, you're already dead.<eos> Two for the price of one.<eos> What are you doing, man?<eos> You're gonna start a war.<eos> "And then many will fall away, and they will betray each other and hate one another.<eos> And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.<eos> But the one who endures to the end... he will be saved."<eos> You're crazy.<eos> Crazy would be leaving you alive to run a very profitable drug business.
Have you even seen the dashboard footage that's all over the news?<eos> You don't you see the opportunity?<eos> You see a man you want dead who won't die.<eos> I see a marketer's dream.<eos> Why spend all your time killing and intimidating your criminal customers in the dark when you should be selling guns to police departments in the light?<eos> Guns that can handle these new threats.<eos> Go on.<eos> Word is you have a weapon that can take him down.<eos> Kill Luke Cage.<eos> But if you do, and you go big, everyone else will come to you to help take down the rest of these super-freaks that are upsetting the natural order of things.
How are you going to get this stuff out of me?<eos> Right....<eos> Imagine that your skin works like a form of Velcro, under a sort of lock and key.<eos> And in order to cut through it, he's got to weaken the lock and key, so we can remove the shrapnel.<eos> How do you plan to do that?<eos> I'm going to dip your skin in boiling acid, and then, remove the shrapnel.<eos> What?<eos> I've tried it with animals.<eos> He's putting me in a rotisserie spit?<eos> I think he wants to deep fry you... like a turkey.
Cage, Cottonmouth, all of it.<eos> You'll need proof.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> You swam that whole way?<eos> Doesn't seem as far away now.<eos> You ever hold someone in your arms, hear them breathing against your chest, and you're in one emotional place... and they're in another?<eos> And you have absolutely no idea what they're thinking.<eos> It's called having a boyfriend.<eos> Reva lied to me.<eos> She helped you to disappear... because she was protecting you.
And you're done.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Come at me again, bitch, and I won't hold my tongue about Willie anymore.<eos> You say a word, and the checks stop coming.<eos> He'll get pulled from Lieber Academy so quick, your head...<eos> Luke?<eos> Luke, are you all right?<eos> Willis Stryker... is my brother.<eos> I never wanted to accept it, but... it's real.<eos> - They never told you?
All my dad's convention trips with Dana.<eos> He was always so protective of her.<eos> Who's Dana?<eos> His secretary.<eos> Willis's mother.<eos> He was two years older than me.<eos> For years, my mother couldn't conceive, and then one day, I... I came along.<eos> That's why everybody called me the miracle baby.<eos> I hated that spotlight.<eos> They should have told you.
We are ten feet from the door.<eos> Just bust through.<eos> I can't cover you from every angle.
No.<eos> We're staying.<eos> Nobody leaves. Not until we have them.<eos> - What you talking about, Willis?<eos> - You got jokes? Right now?<eos> You're the one who's joking if you think that we're escaping here without a plan.<eos> Later for that pre-written shit.<eos> Sometimes you gotta freestyle.<eos> Look, you got one Judas bullet left.<eos> What are you gonna do if Luke Cage takes you head on?
- Inspector?<eos> - Misty.<eos> - Misty.<eos> - Inspector...<eos> Do you have your phone?<eos> - I lost mine a long time ago.<eos> - Shit!<eos> Look, you gotta go upstairs, okay?<eos> Those people, they need you.<eos> I can't leave you.
What's wrong?<eos> It needs to be tighter.<eos> Brace yourself.<eos> One...<eos> I feel like getting my Crispus Attucks on up there.<eos> Mmm, you gotta be smart about this.<eos> There are too many innocent people up there who could end up dead.<eos> I might not have a choice.<eos> I had a choice.<eos> I should have trusted you.
- They all got to go.<eos> - Take care of it then.<eos> You and me, we get out of this... we're gonna have a long talk.<eos> Best believe that.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Downstairs.<eos> Carl, Carl, Carl.<eos> Here you go again.<eos> Bobbing and weaving because you're too scared to take a hit.<eos> It's just like I taught you in the ring.
Cage must not escape.<eos> Fire at will!<eos> Go, go, go, go, go!<eos> He went down the south side.<eos> Somebody give me a sitrep right now!<eos> Team two...<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> Young cops always wanna chase somebody.<eos> Me, I'd rather be where they're already going.<eos> They told us these Judas bullets can kill someone like you.
Don't run.<eos> I'd rather die than go back to prison.<eos> Live free or die?<eos> You wanna get all New Hampshire about this shit?<eos> Fine with me.<eos> - Cop killers don't survive these streets.<eos> - I didn't kill a cop.<eos> My problem isn't with you or yours.<eos> It's much bigger than that.<eos> Some people are calling you a hero for what you did.
I can still collect from the shadows.<eos> - Bad news, Diamondback.<eos> - Take those off!<eos> I went to your crib.<eos> The files you had are gone.<eos> I had you, didn't I?<eos> I couldn't resist.<eos> I like you, Zip.<eos> You've got ambition.<eos> It'll take you far... as long as you stay in your place.
You'd have never seen my black ass again.<eos> I'd rob the occasional bank and never look back.<eos> You got every cop in the city looking for you, brother.<eos> Negroes writing Luke Cage ballads and shit.<eos> So... what's the plan?<eos> To box in all the players.<eos> Well...<eos> Shades is in jail.<eos> Mariah's out, but she ain't exactly on your side.<eos> Now you could tail both of 'em, but no telling how long that'll take for them to lead you to your prey.
Just knowing that she can't be trusted is helpful.<eos> You did a good job, Alex.<eos> Hey, you're my rock!<eos> Later.<eos> What do you want?<eos> That's no way to speak to a business partner.<eos> After what you did to my club, do you really think I'm gonna shuck and jive with you?<eos> You might wanna check your attitude.<eos> If you're not of any use to me, then you're not useful to anyone.<eos> Shades would tell you, if he was still alive.
And the war will be over.<eos> - That's good then.<eos> - Not for us.<eos> No, but for the people.<eos> Less will die.<eos> - Less will die.<eos> - They're thinking of the people.<eos> - Less will die.<eos> - You'll die, though.<eos> I'll kill you.
Just straight to it.<eos> We are hostages of the Ecuadorian Liberation Front.<eos> Um, and I am talking to the president of the United States here when I say the situation is simple.<eos> If you do not pay the ransom, we will be executed.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Okay. - What?<eos> Why are you talking so casually, so nonchalant?<eos> You gotta be begging.<eos> Begging for your life.<eos> This guy, he wants to kill you.
- that has to be put down.<eos> - Yeah, I get the point.<eos> Didn't have to hit me.<eos> You've got this, Finch.<eos> My name is Ian Finch.<eos> This is Frank Bonneville.<eos> We work for the New York radio station Q365 News.<eos> You wanna see these?<eos> No, I don't wanna see anything.<eos> And I'm not talking to you.
We work for the New York radio station Q365 News.<eos> You wanna see these?<eos> No, I don't wanna see anything.<eos> And I'm not talking to you.<eos> As you wish.<eos> In the end, you were great, though.<eos> I'm sorry for what I did, but it was for authenticity,<eos> - for the good of the cause.<eos> - Didn't have to hit me that hard.<eos> So, can I hit you now?
No, I don't wanna see anything.<eos> And I'm not talking to you.<eos> As you wish.<eos> In the end, you were great, though.<eos> I'm sorry for what I did, but it was for authenticity,<eos> - for the good of the cause.<eos> - Didn't have to hit me that hard.<eos> So, can I hit you now?<eos> - You can try.<eos> - No, I should just be allowed to hit you.
So, can I hit you now?<eos> - You can try.<eos> - No, I should just be allowed to hit you.<eos> - Why?<eos> - For the good of the cause.<eos> But it wouldn't be, that would just be you getting revenge.<eos> Not fair.<eos> Here you go.<eos> There it is.<eos> Take it over to the radio station, make sure no one sees you.
- Yeah.<eos> ...I don't really care that she's left me anymore.<eos> See?<eos> I knew you'd get over her.<eos> Well, I can see her for what she really is now.<eos> And it's...<eos> Nah.<eos> - I can see her side a little bit, too.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Well, she did leave her family and friends behind to follow you to New York.
Of course.<eos> But, like, you clearly don't need it now.<eos> You don't care if we live or die.<eos> You're in your element.<eos> All the fame, all the attention.<eos> So long as you're still in the picture, but you can feel it all slipping away.<eos> That's why you wanna hold on to all the cash.<eos> What?<eos> Like you're so perfect.<eos> Maybe it's time the world knew a few home truths about you.
Come on. Let's go find your brother.<eos> I owe him an apology.<eos> Animals should be transported in and remain housed in..<eos> Veterinary care needed by individual animals will have to be provided by the pet's owner.<eos> All right, Malina, take off your hood.<eos> - Someone might recognize me.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> You're gonna get her killed.<eos> Says the guy who tried to kill her yesterday.<eos> Look, I told you, we need to get Tommy's attention, and the best way to do that is with that news crew right there.
The layout, it's the same as a video game I play.<eos> It looks exactly like this.<eos> Come, this way.<eos> If I am right, this elevator will take us to the core.<eos> It's the center of everything.<eos> Well, then, that's where we'll find Tommy.<eos> It's not working.<eos> Janice, look, it's me.<eos> I know I have not been the best husband and/or the best father to Matty Junior, but I have to tell you, there is stuff happening,<eos> Janice, and I need to see you.
No!<eos> [yelling]<eos> ♪ ♪ [whooshing]<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> [grunts] [panting]<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Gonna get you to the hospital.
- That's right.<eos> Experts. - Give me a break.<eos> - I'm being serious. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Honestly, we have a real problem.<eos> - What? - We're gonna have to talk about it.<eos> - What are we gonna do about this?<eos> - Do we have to do this right now?<eos> Yeah, we have to do it right now.<eos> Please don't push me, OK?<eos> And stop walking away when I'm talking to you.
- Yeah.<eos> - Doing... - You're not checking in?<eos> No, I am checking in. - Oh.<eos> But it's kind of a... kind of a long story.<eos> - Welcome to The Drake, sir.<eos> - Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> - Oh, just give me one second, OK?<eos> - At your leisure. - All right.<eos> I'll let you...<eos> Um... awesome to see you.
- Come on, Gary!<eos> - No, we're not doing shots.<eos> All right, calm down.<eos> Uh, let's get everything started, and Gypsy, you wanna get ready?<eos> - Give him a happy birthday.<eos> - Give me a couple of minutes to change.<eos> - Who's she?<eos> - OK, this is a birthday present.<eos> She's a friend of mine, so it's a freebie.<eos> - So, we're gonna put you...
Look that way.<eos> That's for you!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah, hold on.<eos> Gimme one minute, OK?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> What the hell's the matter with you?
Can you guys gimme just one second?<eos> Hey, are you coming back or what?<eos> Yeah, yeah. I'm coming back.<eos> Hey, have you seen a guitar around there?<eos> A guitar?<eos> Uh, I see no guitar.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> It% got, like, a dinosaur on it?<eos> Um, I'm very sure I see no guitar, or a dinosaur.<eos> Hey, I got a question for you.
- Thank you, buddy.<eos> - It was great to see you.<eos> - You too, guys.<eos> Uh, just go upstairs, and I'll be up there in a second.<eos> He doesn't know what he's talking about.<eos> Are you thinking about buying me out of the family business?<eos> Hold on a second, OK?<eos> I'm trying to help you. That's all I'm trying to do.<eos> You're going to take it like I'm doing something personal to you, and I'm not.<eos> I just... I look at you, and, you know, you remind me of one of those days when it's rainy and sunny at the same time.
I know you're pissed.<eos> Oh, you don't blame me?<eos> Well, thank you, Perry!<eos> Thank you for not blaming me for you losing the guitar.<eos> Did Jake talk to you about me?<eos> He always talks about you. No, but did you know he was gonna fire me?<eos> 'Cause he fired me.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, he did say something.<eos> Yeah, and I... and I thought it was a good idea.<eos> You know, get you out from under the store.
Maybe... I mean maybe a little bit, you know, but...<eos> Perry, you hate that job.<eos> Now you can do something that inspires you.<eos> It sucks you guys were talking about me.<eos> No, no, no, no. It was a brief phone call.<eos> He said he would discuss it with you.<eos> I didn't know he would do it today. I thought he would wait until after your birthday.<eos> Well, he did it today, on my birthday.<eos> Today is not your birthday.<eos> Karen, I hate to break it to you but today is my birthday, and you forgot.
You keep blowing up...<eos> Look, you pissing me off... to the highest of "pisstivity."<eos> "Pisstivity" ain't even a word, dumbass.<eos> Shoranda, I don't wanna be over at your house... with all them kids over there smelling like urine.<eos> I know you didn't just say that about my kids.<eos> You bitch, nigga!<eos> Come out!<eos> Come to me!<eos> Everybody is gonna come in your house... they're gonna fuck you!<eos> I've traveled a long way to find you.
Did something strange for a little piece of change. No.<eos> No, for real.<eos> Look, I got a chain of Wing and Things that I landed.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> I'm going around hooking up wiring all over from here to San Diego.<eos> Baby, I want to believe you... but I can't keep uprooting this family... in the middle of the night again.<eos> I can't do that, okay?<eos> These kids need to trust me. They need to believe that we're in a family... that we're a unit, that they're secure.<eos> - I don't feel that right now.<eos> - Babe, the kids do trust you.
Baby, stop.<eos> My dad!<eos> Baby, how did you get here?<eos> - You don't have a car.<eos> - Baby, with love like ours... I don't need a car.<eos> I took the Greyhound. - You took the Greyhound?<eos> - Three days and three nights... just like Jesus Christ did in the desert with Moses...<eos> Adam and Eve. "Holy-lujah."<eos> Baby.<eos> Oh, my God. If Dad catches you here... you know he's gonna kill you.
Hello? Hello!<eos> Babe, let's just go back to the house.<eos> They don't wanna walk.<eos> Come on, let's enjoy this.<eos> We in Beverly Hills.<eos> Look how nice this neighborhood is.<eos> Smell the fresh air.<eos> It's nice, right?<eos> - Oh, man, damn.<eos> - This is dumb. Don't try to take my side either, okay... because I still don't know you like that.
And I will never be your mother... but I want us to at least try and be friends.<eos> I don't like all this fighting that's going on. It's...<eos> It's uncomfortable.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> Look, I brought you a little gift... a little peace offering.<eos> You brought me something?<eos> My mom gave it to me.<eos> Oh, 'cause you don't got no money.<eos> It's a necklace of the Virgin Mary... and now I'm giving it to you to protect you tonight... for this so-called Purge.
- You wanna talk about it?<eos> You don't have to be nice to me.<eos> What do you mean "have to"?<eos> I know I'm a weirdo.<eos> My real mom could barely stand to be around me.<eos> She have birth to me.<eos> All you did was marry my dad.<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> Your mom loved you.<eos> I promise you she loved you.
Don't... that ain't...<eos> - Put the... - Dude, just let...<eos> You wanna be sorry? Get out my motherfucking house.<eos> Tonight, you're being purged for being a liar, Carl Black... - and I'm coming in there!<eos> - You can't get in here!<eos> - Yeah. - Watch, bitch.<eos> It's protected by Viper!<eos> I'm going to cut the power now, Mr. Black.<eos> So it's going to be harder to see you and your family.<eos> Maybe if you smile... it would help us find you in the dark.
You gonna give me all of mine tonight.<eos> And if you don't give me mine...<eos> I'ma have to add some more colors to my flashy track suit.<eos> Yeah, maybe some red or some brown.<eos> Whoever let you walk out the house with that jacket is not your friend.<eos> Nigga! This ain't the time for your goddamn...<eos> I want my money and my dope, nigga.<eos> Tonight.<eos> You wrong, man, 'cause you got busted.<eos> When the police came looking for you, you left... and that's when I took the stuff.
- Okay, now, what's the rules?<eos> - What are the rules?<eos> - What rules?<eos> - The scary movie rules.<eos> Yeah, horror movie rules.<eos> We gotta do the shit that white people don't do.<eos> - Survive?<eos> - No. Let's get out of here quicker than a cat can lick its ass.<eos> Carl Black?<eos> I came to purge you.
I'm just gonna go get him, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> Look, this is my fault.<eos> When I came with all them scams and all that different stuff.<eos> I was just trying to give my family a better life, okay?<eos> - I know.<eos> - And now people getting killed and shit. - Damn.<eos> - Come out, come out wherever you are!<eos> I hope you forgive me.<eos> I forgive you for it.

- Why am I not in a house?"<eos> - You're a nice guy, man.<eos> I started doing all the math, and I thought about it.<eos> It's 'cause motherfuckers like you don't pay shit. Therefore, I can't buy no house like this.<eos> I gotta always chase a motherfucker down... and tonight, on Purge night of all nights... they give me the slip?<eos> Me? All the white motherfuckers... that work there, and they gave it to the mixed nigga?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause they thought I might almost kill your ass.<eos> But tonight, I'll do it, motherfucker.<eos> I got a couple hours left, and I will shoot you in your motherfucking face.
I got balls, homie.<eos> Yeah, boom!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just like Paris Hilton did back in the day.<eos> Turn it, turn it.<eos> I know the dance move. I know the dance move. I know the dance move.<eos> Oh, but turn it around. Look out.<eos> Get ready!<eos> Do-rag!<eos> - Gonna kill you first.
- Nothing wrong with Ellen.<eos> - Fuck you talking about?<eos> - It's Freddy.<eos> Shit.<eos> Think I do want to watch Ellen shake that ass today.<eos> Mind moving over a little bit, homey, please, rest of us could see? You could wheel out a full<eos> - display case... - Thank you.<eos> These won't kill me, will they?<eos> Well, if you get an erection lasting more than five hours, call "The Guinness Book of Records."<eos> He wants to see you.
C'mon now.<eos> You right, sir, she young. Gimme 250.<eos> C'mon.<eos> But with the right teacher, a wench like that?<eos> 250.<eos> Could be workin' a long time.<eos> There it is!<eos> Massa, sure would be a shame to watch her go to waste for such a low price.<eos> And what the hell would you know about what's a little and what's a lot, huh?<eos> I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but whatever it is, you better quit.
Just gonna climb up and help you out.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Who is this child?<eos> What happened?<eos> Burnin' up.<eos> This mine!<eos> This my dress!<eos> My dress! This my dress!<eos> Go now! Get out, ya!<eos> We're not gonna hurt you.

I know as much as you.<eos> I suppose if missus is suggesting it... Master Reese don't mind the trip.<eos> I sure wouldn't wanna wait another season to see ya.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> My nana got it from my grandaddy.<eos> She brought it with her when she was taken from Africa.<eos> Said it was the only thing that kept her mind free.<eos> It's pretty.<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> In case I don't see you for a while, you... have something that reminds you of me.

Well, if I was to receive a gift offering...<eos> I certainly wouldn't object.<eos> You are caution, Reverend.<eos> I am but a servant.<eos> Here's some salt pork and some tomatoes for when you get hungry.<eos> Thank you, Momma.<eos> Don't y'all go getting' worried now.<eos> I'll be back directly.<eos> I know.<eos> Pray the Lord brings you back safe.
When we fight?<eos> Soon.<eos> The Lord will give us a sign.<eos> Until then we remain steadfast, ready to strike at the moment of the Lord's call.<eos> With the strength of our Father, we'll cut the head from the serpent.<eos> We'll destroy them all.<eos> Somethin' wrong?<eos> There was a meeting a few nights ago.<eos> And although I was not privy to what was said... I can only assume... by the secrecy that it was not altogether productive.<eos> Now, I don't know what ideas is floating' around in your head... but I been around here long enough to know... that the result of certain ideas is not gonna get you what you want.
Of the gallant south<eos> Them big, bulging eyes<eos> And the twisted mouth<eos> Scent of magnolia<eos> Clean and fresh<eos> Here is a fruit<eos> Cherry.<eos> It's Nat, love.<eos> Keep on workin'.<eos> They lookin' for you.
What's wrong?<eos> I hacked into the Agency.<eos> For Christian Dassault.<eos> I got all the black ops files, we're putting them online.<eos> We need to move.<eos> 2 seconds forward.<eos> Blonde hair.<eos> Enhance.<eos> Find her.<eos> I told you, Christian Dassault is going to get you killed.
Survive.<eos> I don't believe that, and neither do you.<eos> Look at yourself.<eos> Look at what you're doing.<eos> You can't live like this for much longer.<eos> Jason, I came here because I found something.<eos> I found your father's name in the Treadstone files. He was an analyst.<eos> He wasn't in operations.<eos> He wasn't near any of that stuff.<eos> I'm telling you what I saw.

He was an analyst.<eos> He wasn't in operations.<eos> He wasn't near any of that stuff.<eos> I'm telling you what I saw.<eos> It looked like he was involved directly.<eos> And there's more.<eos> More about you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Before you joined the program, they were watching you.
Well, kisses come in all sorts of ways, baby.<eos> People act strange around death.<eos> There are those who talk about everything... but the person who died.<eos> And I told Mr. Rinaldo that two pounds of meat was plenty... but he insisted on giving me three.<eos> And I said, "That's ridiculous..."<eos> There are those who only talk about the person who died.<eos> Your mother was always very nice to me.<eos> I thought she was pretty too.<eos> I always wondered why she didn't have a boyfriend or something.<eos> There are those who try to cheer you up.
No.<eos> I don't want my privacy.<eos> Mr. Church, I fell asleep in this armchair.<eos> Mr. Church?<eos> Mr. Church?<eos> Mr. Church...<eos> People act strange around death.<eos> There are those who talk about everything... but the person who died.<eos> Those who talk about only the person who died.<eos> Those who try to cheer you up.
Can I ask you something crazy but you have to promise not to laugh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you think the story of the Ellcrys is true?<eos> You mean the part where it's a barrier holding back a Demon army?<eos> Come on, Amberle, we both know magic died out with the Druids.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> Forget I asked.<eos> Come to the celebration tonight.<eos> People need to see you.<eos> I need to see you.
You were supposed to be in Shady Vale.<eos> Did my uncle send you to bring me home?<eos> Flick had no intention of telling me your whereabouts.<eos> But his thoughts were never hard to read.<eos> What...<eos> Who exactly are you?<eos> I am Allanon.<eos> We must reach Druids' Keep.<eos> Wait, you're a Druid?<eos> Right before my mom passed away, she told me I needed to find you.
- Yes you were.<eos> - Not at all.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> Are you going to do this to me every time?<eos> Don't you think we could talk once in a while?<eos> I'm snowed under with work, but I do my best to come see you.<eos> I'm doing it to try to reconnect with you.<eos> What's the point if you don't make an effort?<eos> Xavier,<eos> I'm talking to you.
Maybe I'll join you.<eos> Me too.<eos> Great idea.<eos> I'm tired of chasing scumbags.<eos> You're all bonkers.<eos> We take after our boss.<eos> Right, I'm off to go swim.<eos> To go what?<eos> Can I join you?<eos> Can I take you home?
I was a bit younger than you.<eos> My little brother found him.<eos> It was an awful shock for us all, but Xavier<eos> - that's my little brother's name - completely shut himself off.<eos> It wasn't his choice, he couldn't do otherwise.<eos> Today he's in a mental institution where he'll probably stay for the rest of his life.<eos> I see him whenever I can, but we don't talk any more.<eos> Life as you and I know it has left him.<eos> You still have a choice.<eos> You can either let the guilt eating away at you take over, or you can trust those who love you.
True, I was mad at him when he scratched himself to the point of drawing blood.<eos> Now I know he did it to feel alive.<eos> He and they had something in common.<eos> They would hurt themselves in order to protect themselves.<eos> I think it's time I looked at Xavier differently and the two of us made peace.<eos> I wanted to say I'm sorry I spoke to you that way.<eos> I was an absolute fool.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> If you can.<eos> I won't judge you any more. I'll no longer blame you for being you.

what happened<eos> This action<eos> Do you know what it means Now you ask<eos> I've noticed it for a while<eos> This is an action when a kitten trying to suck the milk<eos> If the kitten was separated with it's mother when it was very little<eos> This will make them to keep the habit<eos> Abandoned Kittens often do<eos> These little guys unexpectedly saddled with heavy stuff<eos> Do they see you as their mother
It's also not good for the eyes if you keep sleeping, right?<eos> Brother<eos> Uncle, give me some other kushiage<eos> Ok<eos> Kushiage, here you go<eos> I am back<eos> This early? Yes<eos> Played Pa-chin-ko for a while<eos> Also had a great meal Thank you<eos> I'll call you back
How are you doing?<eos> -Quite well.<eos> What about the girls?<eos> -They are with me and are doing well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you know where the gun come from?<eos> -Kotiimme broken into.<eos> Nothing has been exported, but the gun was left.<eos> I mentioned it to the police.<eos> I know how we can get you out.

Hey, Reda.<eos> I am with my niece.<eos> You're doing it, what it is told.<eos> He introduced me to the coach.<eos> Your sister was his idea.<eos> Otherwise, you would not have agreed to take the medicine.<eos> He certainly likes you.<eos> But money prevailed.<eos> Do not waste any more time.<eos> My niece will want to meet you.
Do you ever feel inconsistences in your world?<eos> Or repetitions?<eos> All lives have routine.<eos> Mine's no different.<eos> Still, I never cease to wonder at the thought that any day the course of my whole life could change with just one chance encounter.<eos> Don't mind me.<eos> Just trying to look chivalrous.<eos> You came back.<eos> I told you I would.<eos> Can I see you home?
I forget you dress like a cowboy, but that's about the extent of it.<eos> See that one?<eos> - Yeah. - That's the Judas steer.<eos> Rest will follow wherever you make him go.<eos> How do you pick him out?<eos> Just know these things.<eos> Same as I knew you'd be back.<eos> You saying I'm predictable?<eos> There's a path for everyone.<eos> Your path leads you back to me.
- Yeah. - That's the Judas steer.<eos> Rest will follow wherever you make him go.<eos> How do you pick him out?<eos> Just know these things.<eos> Same as I knew you'd be back.<eos> You saying I'm predictable?<eos> There's a path for everyone.<eos> Your path leads you back to me.<eos> I know things will work out the way they're meant to.<eos> Same as I know my daddy still won't be happy to see you.
Go ahead.<eos> I'm in no rush to meet my judgment, but I'm more sure of the outcome than you, you son of a...<eos> Nothing but milk, then.<eos> Shame of it is you killed the old woman before any of us could have a turn.<eos> I reckon she's still warm enough.<eos> Nobody gonna judge you for it.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Shit, shit, shit.<eos> Last question, Dolores.<eos> What if I told you that you were wrong?
If it's her word against yours.<eos> Yes, they will.<eos> There's no smoke without fire.<eos> - Isn't that the way these things work?<eos> - You have a visitor.<eos> Sam?<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> How are you?<eos> Good!<eos> Good to see you.
- So do I!<eos> I believe in the Church and believe in the sanctity of confession.<eos> People trust us.<eos> And the way I see it, if we betray that trust, well... .. then we're all buggered.<eos> Abigail was pregnant.<eos> - Who was the father?<eos> - She wouldn't say.<eos> She tried to tell you first.<eos> Do you know that?<eos> She didn't trust you to keep it to yourself.
O-oh, no, I had the latte.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There he is!<eos> I forgot his name.<eos> - Geils.<eos> - Geils!<eos> Tanner, Hoffman.<eos> We missed you, buddy.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Oh, and by the way, uh, Lieutenant wants to see you.
These guys talk without moving their mouths.<eos> I mean, look at my dumb old mouth moving as I'm talking.<eos> These guys have a gift from god.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> If there's something personal going on with you and this case, you need to tell me now.<eos> There's nothing going on.<eos> No, not even with a head cock.<eos> There's nothing going on.<eos> Geils, trust me, okay?<eos> You need to let it go, or it'll eat you alive.
You say it, and I'll...<eos> I'll just remember it.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - 2333. Okay, start any time you want.<eos> I feel like Dr. Zaius is giving us the runaround.<eos> You think he has something to do with the stolen painting?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think this one we just leave unsolved.<eos> Leave unsolved?<eos> I've literally never heard either of those words come out of your mouth, and I've known you for three weeks.

Yes, it's the minimum amount you have to pay to enter a poker tournament.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Hello, Tribeca. Partridge!<eos> Stand down.<eos> This is my bust.<eos> And this... is my bust.<eos> The game is Texas Hold 'em.<eos> Minimum bet... $10,000.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I told you, I've never lost.
Thanks, anyway.<eos> Never mind.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - Let me buy you back in.<eos> - Why?<eos> It took us six years to get this close to Frontbut.<eos> - You did it in two days.<eos> - One day, actually.<eos> Damn it, I hate you so much.
Look at that!<eos> Well done, Geils.<eos> Stand him up.<eos> Atkins, we made a promise!<eos> Sorry, Bigfish, but we also made another promise...<eos> To preserve and uphold the law, and you broke that promise.<eos> [Crying] I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> These nice policemen are gonna take you down to the precinct, and they're gonna book you.
Grab that for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, yeah, Keith, to the back.<eos> Ben, James.<eos> Can I have a hot towel, please?<eos> Of course, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There is no need to raise your voice. At me like that, sir.<eos> Now, you may use your leaf blower when we have reached 10,000 feet and not a moment before.<eos> If you're not careful, they'll drive you crazy.
L.A.P.D.<eos> Hang on. Let me get my gun.<eos> That's my gun.<eos> I'm cuffing her.<eos> Oh, wait. No, that's my hand.<eos> Who's touching my leg?<eos> Someone is touching my leg.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yeah, it's a real pay phone.<eos> I'll call you back.
Anyway, look, we chillin' eating Cheez-Its.<eos> Out of nowhere, she just starts sucking my dick. I swear to God.<eos> That's Rico.<eos> I put that online.<eos> He don't take shit from nobody.<eos> Like, all he do is just sit around and smoke.<eos> But he's still ripped.<eos> Guys don't fuck with him.<eos> But girls do.<eos> He can't give it to you like I can, baby!
Like, in school, I can't play pick up, can't take a piss,<eos> can't pull no girls...<eos> Boo, nigga.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Bruh, she must have had the balls in there, and everything. Shit.<eos> You know I love it when they do that shit, too, nigga.<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> You ain't never had your dick wet.<eos> Nigga, fuck you.<eos> Damn, B, that kid looks like you.
These two with you?<eos> I already...<eos> I know.<eos> And now I'm asking.<eos> They're my friends.<eos> Come on, let's go see your grandma before we talk.<eos> She still alive?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> She don't make no sense, though.<eos> You shut the fuck up before I kick you out this house.
I want something to drink.<eos> You tryin' to get faded, cuz?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Flac, hey.<eos> You remember that little soft-ass nigga we took the shoes from, nigga?<eos> Man, these niggas tryin' to get on me, though at the park, you feel me?<eos> This nigga threw a basketball at me, nigga.<eos> Nigga, who throws a basketball, nigga?<eos> That's dumb, bruh.<eos> Nah, this nigga say he looking for you.
Yeah.<eos> It's me.<eos> How you feeling, kid?<eos> Okay.<eos> How are you?<eos> Fine.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You don't even know who the fuck is in there.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Okay.<eos> How are you?<eos> Fine.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You don't even know who the fuck is in there.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What is your problem, man?<eos> What, you got a gun now?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you!
Mama.<eos> Mama.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hey.<eos> Goodbye, buddy.<eos> Oh, Charlie, I'll miss you.<eos> xCHARLIE: Yeah, qeli, I'm...<eos> Now, you go to sleep.<eos> Charlie, will I ever see you again?
- Richard, Richard, Richard.<eos> - There's no reason to involve her in this.<eos> - Richard.<eos> It's not gonna help you.<eos> Listen.<eos> Just give me the knife and this will all be over.<eos> - It isn't gonna help you.<eos> - Richard, I don't know what to fucking do!<eos> Don't worry, Maggie.<eos> He's not going to hurt you.
- What... what is this?<eos> I... I saw you die.<eos> I had no idea that it would feel like this.<eos> The years I spent operating on people. Opening them up and stitching them back together again.<eos> It's remarkable, the sensation it's not pain, more a sense of release.<eos> - Why... why are you...<eos> - Be quiet, please.<eos> This is uncharted territory.<eos> The chance to study my own transformation.<eos> I understand your hesitation, Alison but let me ask you all these years, haven't you ever wished to save someone beyond saving?
I am calling her back.<eos> - Richard.<eos> Please. Don't do this.<eos> But it's already done.<eos> You are so beautiful, Alison.<eos> You will become something truly remarkable.<eos> This is a slaughter house.<eos> - Get this off of me!<eos> - Shut the fuck up!<eos> I should've killed you back at the house.
Just wait.<eos> Just... just wait.<eos> What do... what do we have to do?<eos> Just wait.<eos> This is your fault.<eos> This is your fault!<eos> I wasn't there.<eos> You should've protected them!<eos> Mother wants us to stay.<eos> I told you, look after them.
Ten times the price tomorrow.<eos> Here to buy some of that property you sellin'.<eos> We want profit astronomically.<eos> I should have known that family life wasn't for you.<eos> All the death and destruction, everything I done, all that is for naught.<eos> Doubt I'll finish this route.<eos> We're better off here, me and William.<eos> Interesting you would rather be here instead of with your wife and child.<eos> William.<eos> Didn't 'spect we'd be seeing you again.
Naomi, if I would've known...<eos> That wasn't your fault.<eos> I never sent word.<eos> It only ever felt like I caught a tiny piece of your heart...<eos> This one dark night in a lonesome barn...<eos> One night of sin...<eos> Don't say that.<eos> It's why I went with you to the railroad.<eos> 'Cause I'd already asked so much of you, I...<eos> I couldn't ask you to stay in that fort.
I could hardly look at her.<eos> She is a beautiful girl.<eos> There's a sadness in her.<eos> You can see it.<eos> There is a strength there, and grace.<eos> We been through drought, Injuns, plague of grasshoppers...<eos> There was also William's first steps.<eos> Christmas.<eos> All the apple pie.<eos> And all of it melts from her eyes... whenever she looks at you.
I pray you learn this.<eos> For without love... you will die a lonely, wretched thing.<eos> And the stray sheep?<eos> Would you deny them the love of their shepherd?<eos> Isaac's gone to water the horses.<eos> Brigham Young hopes you're in church on Sunday morning, front row, so he can bless your marriage.<eos> My father would have wanted me to keep my vow to you.<eos> This ain't your head talking.<eos> William is your son.<eos> It ain't right for me to keep him from you.
You kept your word.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I ain't done it for you.<eos> I know who you done it for.<eos> You're leaving.<eos> Isaac... is a good man.<eos> Is this is the right thing?<eos> It's the only thing.<eos> William.<eos> I was going to say this to you when you got older, but I best tell it to you now.
You know I'm right.<eos> Charming.<eos> What's that, Fatty?<eos> You remind me of a gorilla I saw once in a traveling circus.<eos> Only the gorilla had better breeding.<eos> You'd be wise to mind your hole or I'm liable to give y'another.<eos> I'd wager your mother dropped you on your head more than once when you were a baby.<eos> Whiskey fingers, as you well know, can be slippery.<eos> You're nothin' but a bloated old Mary-Ann.<eos> I should kill you right here and now!
- Purchase orders and contracts for all the abandoned government buildings in Massachusetts.<eos> Turns out that the paint chip that Kent found was five different layers of paint.<eos> So we have to look through all of this stuff and...<eos> Figure out which building was painted in this order.<eos> That's gonna take forever.<eos> Now that we know it's not an inside job, we're a task force.<eos> We have all the assets we need.<eos> Detective Rizzoli's in charge.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Good to meet you.
No.<eos> You're very photogenic, which is unfortunate because I need you to play a different part right now,<eos> - not audition for "Cats." - "Cats" closed a long time ago.<eos> I never paid much attention to Broadway.<eos> I really don't wanna hit you again.<eos> It seems unsporting, you being tied up and all.<eos> Then tell me what part I'm supposed to be playing.<eos> Oh. Here we go.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Little fear, some pleading, just a hint of hope that someone might actually save you.
Then tell me what part I'm supposed to be playing.<eos> Oh. Here we go.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Little fear, some pleading, just a hint of hope that someone might actually save you.<eos> Jane Rizzoli got under your skin.<eos> - No, she didn't.<eos> - You think that picture with a little blood on my lip is gonna bother her.<eos> That's the plan.<eos> I-If you really wanted to get a rise out of her, why didn't you kidnap one of her sisters?<eos> Because stealing you from right under her nose was more fun.
and tell him to find her.<eos> Stick with her until we get to her.<eos> Bye, Maura.<eos> - Maura!<eos> - Kiki.<eos> - What a nice surprise.<eos> - Surprise, yes.<eos> Uh, Vince and I are gonna get something to eat.<eos> - Can you join?<eos> - Oh, I really can't talk to you.
I don't have son, okay?<eos> I've answered your questions.<eos> Unless you want to pay for his massage, no more questions.<eos> Maybe we should discuss this down at the station, where there are fewer distractions.<eos> And maybe you should talk to my ass!<eos> I don't like having a door slammed in my face.<eos> She is hiding something.<eos> - She was working.<eos> - On a naked man.<eos> I tell you, if we could get a warrant,
Stakeouts are hard on old guys.<eos> - Ohh, here we go.<eos> - No, I'm not retiring.<eos> No, but you're thinking about it.<eos> - Well, you got to plan for the future.<eos> - I plan!<eos> My plan is to stop your plan of retiring.<eos> So, Frankie, what's going on?<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Well, all I can really tell you is that I have to watch that alleyway.
Yeah, then this is the perfect assignment for you.<eos> It's gonna make you think outside the box.<eos> Maybe it would be easier if I felt better.<eos> Well, don't you worry.<eos> I'll take care of everything in the lab.<eos> All you have to do is lie back under the covers, open your pores, relax your mind,<eos> - and let your imagination flow. - Mm.<eos> - Enjoy. - Okay.<eos> - All right, what are you doing there?<eos> - Just sketching you.
Okay. Well, let's talk.<eos> All right.<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> Guess when you postpone your wedding twice, a person could have some questions.<eos> Well, go. Talk to her.<eos> - Are you going back in?<eos> - No. I'm gonna let him sit for a while, have Nina check out these legitimate businesses, start to dismantle her organization.<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> I would never tell you to draw a sociopath to you.
Yeah. Yep.<eos> Right back.<eos> Bye.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Ron was invited to a medical conference in Paris this weekend.<eos> He asked if my passport was in order.<eos> - So he wants to take you to Paris.<eos> - That's impossible, right?<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I'm gonna give your advice back to you.
- What is it?<eos> - A lifetime's worth of favors.<eos> What are you gonna do with the bomb?<eos> Protocol is to blow it up on scene, which we'll do once the sergeant's safe.<eos> Well, is there any way to disarm it, you know, so we can keep it for evidence?<eos> - Highly irregular.<eos> - Come on, Bryce.<eos> Help us out.<eos> I'm letting you be a hero today.<eos> Tell you what, let's talk about this over a nice glass of water when everybody's finished for the day, okay?
I had to be extracted.<eos> It was a precision operation.<eos> Our bomb techs are the best.<eos> Here I am without a scratch.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> - But you could have been ...<eos> - That's the job.<eos> I know.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - I fully intended to tell you, but I'm so in it trying to find the sicko that put that mine in the ground.
And then what?<eos> You think your political friends will stick by you if you flee the scene?<eos> Put it down.<eos> Come on in.<eos> We'll talk about it.<eos> Not another step.<eos> Leave us alone.<eos> Get out!<eos> That's an order, detective.<eos> Bomb squad will be here any minute, and I'm not leaving you alone again.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> I won't let anything bad happen to you.<eos> You're stuck with me forever.<eos> Hello.<eos> Is that your mother?<eos> Welcome to the family.<eos> You gave her a key?<eos> She's my mother.<eos> Sorry, I should've told you.
Hi.<eos> Oh... Morning, Linda.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, you cannot call me Linda anymore.<eos> Now, it's "Mom."<eos> Morning, Mom.<eos> - Morning, daughter.<eos> - Mom, it's...<eos> It's 7:00 in the morning...<eos> I know, sweetie.<eos> It's good to see you.
I know what knocked up sounds like, and that's it.<eos> Oh, you know what knocked up sounds like?<eos> Can you assist him with the suturing in Exam 1?<eos> Sure thing, Fran.<eos> Preggers.<eos> You heard it here first.<eos> Whatever.<eos> And we're done.<eos> There you go.<eos> Emily here is going to bandage you up, all right?
Oh, yeah.<eos> They tell me you're in medicine.<eos> She's a nurse at County.<eos> What an honorable profession.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Um... Father, I am sorry.<eos> She's not been feeling very well.<eos> In certain cases, it's the exact thing that needs to be done.<eos> Mmm. You could be right. Hey.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
She's in the shower now.<eos> Okay, I'll check when she's out, but...<eos> Mom, I gotta go.<eos> I want you.<eos> I thought you weren't feeling very well.<eos> No, I feel amazing.<eos> Don't I look amazing?<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> You just yacked your guts out all over a priest.<eos> Right after you accused him of raping you with his eyes.
- Get out!<eos> - Emily, get out of my house.<eos> You should be horrified because you know that when you look at me,<eos> I'm not Emily.<eos> No.<eos> You're so, so pretty.<eos> Okay. Emily.<eos> Please.<eos> It's me.<eos> Emily's not here to protect you anymore.
I will be.<eos> Let me in, Tara.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Take my hand, Tara.<eos> Tara. I'm calling the cops, Emily!<eos> Take my hand, Tara.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Take my hand!<eos> Tara, I'm not going to kill you.
Let me in, Tara.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Take my hand, Tara.<eos> Tara. I'm calling the cops, Emily!<eos> Take my hand, Tara.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Take my hand!<eos> Tara, I'm not going to kill you.<eos> I'm not going to kill you!
Leave me alone!<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Take my hand, Tara.<eos> Tara. I'm calling the cops, Emily!<eos> Take my hand, Tara.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Take my hand!<eos> Tara, I'm not going to kill you.<eos> I'm not going to kill you!<eos> I'm not going to kill you! Kill you!
Help!<eos> Oh, my God. Help me, William.<eos> Help! Help me, William.<eos> Help me.<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> What's happening?<eos> That should hold.<eos> But we're gonna have to call an ambulance.<eos> Why did you do this?<eos> I was going to hurt you.
Help! Help me, William.<eos> Help me.<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> What's happening?<eos> That should hold.<eos> But we're gonna have to call an ambulance.<eos> Why did you do this?<eos> I was going to hurt you.<eos> What?<eos> I was going to stab you while you slept.
The demon inside of me.<eos> At first, he just whispered.<eos> I could hear him, but I couldn't make out what he was saying.<eos> But then...<eos> Then he got louder.<eos> And now...<eos> And now he's overpowering me.<eos> And I can't fight him.<eos> He killed Tara.<eos> And he tried to kill you.
That's not her blood.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, look.<eos> The marriage coach.<eos> Here to help us with our cold feet.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who I am.<eos> Whose blood is this?<eos> Emily, what have you done?<eos> What I'll do to you.
You don't have the strength, Roizman.<eos> They kicked you out.<eos> Excommunicated.<eos> You're shamed.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't have the strength.<eos> But he does.<eos> He doesn't believe.<eos> He'll get there.<eos> And when he does, he'll purge you back to hell, where you belong.
I love that you ride your bike in the rain, and that sunlight makes you sneeze.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love how you kiss.<eos> "By your coming, by your birth."<eos> I love how you always taste so sweet.<eos> "By your baptism and holy fasting."<eos> "Cross and passion."<eos> I love how you bite your lip when you're nervous.<eos> "By your death and burial."<eos> William! I'm losing my desire not to hurt you, William.
Do you realize what it's going to cost me if I have to push?<eos> Hopefully, it won't come to that.<eos> Every restaurant in the Midwest has a basement and a furnace.<eos> - This is standard stuff.<eos> - I understand.<eos> But it's our name on that building.<eos> God forbid the floor caves in and people get hurt or worse because of some design flaw we missed.<eos> Let's just slow down a minute and make sure it's done right.<eos> So much for the Speedee System, huh?<eos> - Did he just hang up on you?
I have to go, I'm sorry, I have to go.<eos> Well?<eos> Do we have him?<eos> Yep.<eos> The DNA came through.<eos> The blood drops at Bundy are Simpson's type and the Rockingham glove matches a mix of Simpson and the victim's blood.<eos> Well, thank God.<eos> Let's put him behind bars.<eos> Tom, how long have you known me?<eos> Look, I know you have a warrant for his arrest, but there's no reason you have to come and get Mr. Simpson when I can bring him to you.
Oh, Bobby, help me, man.<eos> Please help me, Bobby.<eos> We're all inside here.<eos> We love you.<eos> Your whole family's here, Juice.<eos> Please, just... just come on inside.<eos> Is-is Mama here?<eos> Ye... Uh, yes.<eos> She's on the phone. She's waiting...<eos> She's on the house phone waiting to talk to you, Juice.
He's got a gun!<eos> No, no!<eos> Those are pictures!<eos> Those are framed pictures of his kids!<eos> I'm sorry, guys.<eos> Sorry.<eos> 91 clear. 8814 clear.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Oh. - All right, all right.<eos> We got you, come on.
He had a dinner.<eos> How are you, my brother?<eos> "He had a dinner."<eos> You should've seen what I had for dinner.<eos> I didn't even know what it was.<eos> It was slop.<eos> Then I kept running to the toilet, but my toilet's<eos> - clogged up, so you can imagine...<eos> - You have to be strong.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.
You are a mess.<eos> You can't walk into that courtroom like this.<eos> Everyone's gonna be watching.<eos> Everybody thinks I'm guilty.<eos> So change their minds.<eos> Have you forgotten who you are?<eos> These walls around you don't change that.<eos> You know what you mean to people?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, then let me tell you what you were once to me.
Here you gentlemen go.<eos> Eggs Benedict... and steak and frittata.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And enjoy.<eos> Well, then... to whom do I invoice my hours?<eos> Who should I bill?<eos> Lee, you're pro bono.<eos> Could I offer either of you Tabasco or...<eos> No, we're fine.<eos> Bob... may I remind you, I was your first call.
She shouldn't be talking to you about these things.<eos> Why?<eos> The entire universe is talking about it.<eos> And people ask me about it all day.<eos> I mean, he is my godfather.<eos> That's right, he is, and your Uncle Juice... your Uncle Juice is a good man.<eos> In fact, I'm gonna tell the whole world exactly that on tv.<eos> Barbara Walters called me.<eos> - Barbara Walters?<eos> - Yeah. - She knows you?
Well, it's complicated.<eos> On one hand, he was the driver in what looked like Simpson's getaway attempt.<eos> There was passports, fake beard, $8,700 in cash.<eos> Refused to stop the vehicle for police when ordered.<eos> On the other hand, Simpson was holding a gun to his own head.<eos> He may have pointed it at Cowlings.<eos> I guess it comes down to establishing what the situation was inside that vehicle.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we're thinking about pressing charges.<eos> I've known you forever, and I think you're the one to run with it.
We have to stop looking at this case as a slam dunk.<eos> This article...<eos> It's a declaration of war.<eos> Then Dershowitz says,<eos> "Once I decide to take a case, I have only one agenda: "I want to win.<eos> "I will try by every fair and legal means to get my client off without regard to the consequences."<eos> So they're saying that this racist cop framed me just because I'm black? !<eos> It could explain a lot, Juice.<eos> I mean, th-this Fuhrman cop and-and the glove.<eos> And why not do everything we can to get you out of here if-if you're not supposed to be here?
I work with black cops every day.<eos> I think your S.I.D. investigated one of my black buddies.<eos> I met with Fuhrman.<eos> Good.<eos> You can fill me in tomorrow.<eos> Uh, he says all the appropriate things.<eos> But?<eos> But, uh, truthfully, guy's not right.<eos> I get a really bad vibe from him.<eos> Chris, no one's asking you to date him, just prep him.
D.A.s don't go on talk shows.<eos> It's a sensitive case.<eos> No press.<eos> We need to reconsider Fuhrman.<eos> Look, he's wrong for this case.<eos> You have had a rough couple of weeks.<eos> We're not changing our trial strategy because of it.<eos> Toughen up.<eos> You're letting Johnnie get into your head.<eos> Can I share something with you?
Johnnie Cochran.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> W... What time is it?<eos> A-Are you still at work?<eos> You're kidding.<eos> All right, all right, go ahead.<eos> Shapiro's staff messed up and didn't submit 12 of our witnesses into discovery.<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna have to remove those names out of your opening statement tomorrow, Johnnie.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry to do this to you.
Beautiful.<eos> Right over the fireplace there.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Timing is impeccable.<eos> You're gonna be careful with that.<eos> Nice. Ah.<eos> Sure looks familiar.<eos> It's on loan... from the Cochran collection.<eos> Now, when the jurors tour the crime scene and Rockingham, it's-it's gonna be important for us all to make a positive impression.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - It'll be the only time they see you outside the courtroom.
O.J., the majority of our jurors are black.<eos> Look, do me a favor.<eos> Try to imagine your life before any of this happened.<eos> How many black people did you interact with on a daily basis?<eos> How dialed in were you to the community, issues the average black person deals with?<eos> How many blacks did you actually consider a friend?<eos> A.C., and he's darker than I am!<eos> Are you trying to say something about me, Johnnie?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Nobody's judging you, brother.
Well, they shouldn't be.<eos> Fuhrman is a far from perfect human being, but his procedure that night was pretty damn perfect.<eos> He can describe the events in question three times in a row without missing a note.<eos> He's gonna come off like Jack Webb.<eos> You need to be confident in the strength of what we have, okay?<eos> What you need is some study break.<eos> Hmm-mm, turn it down.<eos> Stop! Stop it.<eos> I cannot afford to be accused of having a good time right now.<eos> Well, who's gonna begrudge you of having a good time?
It's your call.<eos> Listen, the-the stuff in the media about your appearance...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's... it's awful, it's inappropriate, it's sexist, it's horrifying.<eos> Sukey and I are just... we're appalled when it comes on TV.<eos> It doesn't make things easier.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Having said that, I...<eos> Maybe you could... I...<eos> I can put you together with a couple of terrific media consultants, and...
I can't come home yet.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Well, why is he crying?<eos> Well, sweetie, work it out.<eos> Tell him he can watch his cartoons for 30 minutes and then it's your turn.<eos> You know how to read a clock; he doesn't.<eos> Have fun, and I will call you in a little while.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Gordon.<eos> I have a favor to ask of you.
Your Honor, I anticipate this will be just a pro forma request.<eos> Actually, Mr. Cochran,<eos> I wouldn't jump to any conclusions.<eos> I need to review precedent and make a determination.<eos> Until then, you and your assistants may review the tapes.<eos> But other than that, they are to remain sealed.<eos> You understand?<eos> Sealed.<eos> See, if you did it like they teach you in the Academy, you'd never get a fucking thing done.<eos> If the suspect doesn't talk, you give him a shot in the stomach with your stick, and you say, "Listen, boy, I'm talking to you."
Oh, man!<eos> Fuhrman framed me!<eos> He framed me! That was something, huh?<eos> That was a real success for the defense.<eos> Well, I won't be wearing these much longer.<eos> Oh, man, that was magical!<eos> Johnnie's got charisma, man.<eos> Whoo! Oh. That was something!<eos> Bobby, have a good night, huh?<eos> Marcia! I've been looking for you.
And be prepared for, for whatever comes about.<eos> Has justice been done in the courtroom?<eos> We pray... By the time you all see this, you will already know the O.J. verdict.<eos> Who's nervous?<eos> Is anybody nervous?<eos> You know he didn't do it!<eos> It's a big day, huh, O.J.?<eos> The biggest.<eos> Hey, man, I just want you to know...<eos> Guarding you in here...
What are we gonna do now?<eos> Got a minute?<eos> I... I appreciate how hard you fought.<eos> Especially that closing.<eos> This was war.<eos> And you did a superb job.<eos> I respect that.<eos> I... I know how difficult this has been on you.<eos> And when the dust settles...<eos> I'd like to help bring you back into the community.
Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.<eos> - Can you forgive me?<eos> - There's nothing to forgive.<eos> - Forgive me.<eos> - All right.<eos> All right, I forgive you.<eos> You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Where will we go?<eos> If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me.
- I don't care about that.<eos> - Shh!<eos> Shh.<eos> Have you...<eos> have you told them that?<eos> That you don't care?<eos> I just want it to stop.<eos> Help me.<eos> They want me to help you.<eos> They want me to help tear you down.
"Theon Greyjoy?" I said.<eos> "He's dead.<eos> He's been dead a long time."<eos> He let you go?<eos> I escaped.<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> I escaped.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Men died trying to rescue you.
You were a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me.<eos> I know.<eos> I know and I'm sorry.<eos> Stop saying that.<eos> He broke me.<eos> He broke me into 1,000 pieces.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You don't know.<eos> He sent us one of those pieces.<eos> That's why I came for you.
What do you want?<eos> I should have listened to you.<eos> You're the only one...<eos> That doesn't matter anymore.<eos> Stop crying.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Tell me what you want.<eos> You should rule the Iron Islands.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> They've cleaned you up nicely.
You didn't tell them where I'm really from?<eos> You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?<eos> The thing is... my father doesn't like wildlings.<eos> He hoped I'd make a man of myself by "killing some bloody wildlings,"<eos> so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.<eos> I... think we're here.<eos> Sam.<eos> Oh, Sam.<eos> Oh, hello, Mother.<eos> I never thought I'd see you again.
I've lost my appetite.<eos> He dishonors us.<eos> You dishonor yourself.<eos> Your mother's a fine woman.<eos> You're not worthy of her.<eos> To please her, I'll take the wildling in.<eos> She can work in the kitchens.<eos> The bastard will be raised here.<eos> But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.<eos> I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.
- Get your things.<eos> I don't have any things.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - We belong together.<eos> All of us.<eos> What about your mother and sister?<eos> Oh, they'll understand.<eos> Your sister's dress.<eos> She won't mind.<eos> Looks better on you anyway.
Yes, Father.<eos> It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.<eos> Presumably you still know where it is.<eos> You didn't lose Riverrun.<eos> You let the Blackfish take it from you.<eos> He surprised us.<eos> He knows the castle better than anyone.<eos> You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding.<eos> You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave.<eos> Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn't find him.
If I ever get back there.<eos> Yellow hair, blue eyes.<eos> Tallest woman you've ever seen.<eos> Almost as tall as you.<eos> Brienne of Tarth?<eos> - You know her?<eos> - Yours is Brienne of fucking Tarth?<eos> Well, not with her yet.<eos> But I see the way she looks at me.<eos> How does she look at you?
Yellow hair, blue eyes.<eos> Tallest woman you've ever seen.<eos> Almost as tall as you.<eos> Brienne of Tarth?<eos> - You know her?<eos> - Yours is Brienne of fucking Tarth?<eos> Well, not with her yet.<eos> But I see the way she looks at me.<eos> How does she look at you?<eos> Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
Eat. You need it.<eos> The company is moving on to Pentos soon.<eos> You should come with us.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work.<eos> And besides, we need a new actress.<eos> I don't think I could remember all of the lines.<eos> Come with us.<eos> What's left for you here?
For House Frey!<eos> We stand together!<eos> May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last.<eos> And when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance,<eos> "The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards."<eos> You don't even have to do anything, do you?<eos> You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking.<eos> - You're welcome to her.<eos> - She doesn't want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.<eos> Those two have their eyes on you.
I've been ready to die for many years.<eos> If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not.<eos> You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.<eos> You know the great war is still to come.<eos> You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon.<eos> And you know I can help you win that war.<eos> Ride south today.<eos> If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer.<eos> If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself.<eos> I'm having the lord's chamber prepared for you.
I love you. And I make you happy.<eos> You know I do.<eos> Bring me with you.<eos> Let me fight for you.<eos> I can't.<eos> The dwarf told you to do this?<eos> No one tells me to do anything.<eos> Clever fellow.<eos> Can't argue with his logic.<eos> I'm no use to you over there.
Because of what I did.<eos> I caused this.<eos> (Allanon groans, thuds)<eos> Allanon... (Allanon groaning)<eos> The Druid cave... take me here.<eos> I can't stop the bleeding.<eos> - I need to suture it, or...<eos> - Enough.<eos> You must get her to the Ellcrys.<eos> No, I'm not leaving you behind.
(snarling)<eos> (groaning)<eos> (shouting)<eos> (groaning)<eos> Is he breathing?<eos> You worry about your own people, I'll take care of Wil.<eos> What are you gonna do, girl?<eos> Kill us both?<eos> I think you've already proven you aren't up to the task.<eos> Actually, I think I'll just kill you.
As the only remaining member of the Chosen, the burden falls upon your princess.<eos> Are you willing to enter the tree?<eos> If you fail, you will die.<eos> I am.<eos> So, if Amberle fails the trial, the Ellcrys will kill her?<eos> If she succumbs to her fear, yes.<eos> And we will lose any hope of saving this world from the Dagda Mor.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Get up, Amberle.<eos> Look, I didn't mean to hurt you. - Why are you lying?
You can't let your emotions get in the way.<eos> Now stand and fight me, or die with everyone else.<eos> You're weak.<eos> Is this your usual grave look or should I be worried?<eos> She's losing the fight.<eos> You neglected your oath while the world burned. You're no hero.<eos> The Ellcrys knows the truth.<eos> Congratulations, Amberle.<eos> You passed the test.<eos> Now, don't let anything distract you. Not fear.
I just can't believe you're leaving again.<eos> Losing you once was bad enough.<eos> I'm going to come back.<eos> Hey, what happened to you in there?<eos> I saw Lorin.<eos> It was so real, I could touch him, and smell him.<eos> He said I never loved him.<eos> That I was a coward.<eos> No, you're none of those things, Amberle.<eos> It was just an illusion. A way for the Ellcrys to test you.
Save it.<eos> Amberle was right about you all along.<eos> You only give a damn about yourself.<eos> Think about it, Wil.<eos> Why would I come all the way here to kill Amberle when I had a million chances out there in the woods?<eos> How does murdering her even help me?<eos> If someone's really trying to kill her, then they're still out there.<eos> My father's sword.<eos> The Elvin people... were deprived of a great king when he was taken from us.<eos> May it protect you on your journey.
May it protect you on your journey.<eos> I miss him every day.<eos> Me too.<eos> Now more than ever.<eos> You remind me of him so much.<eos> He was just like you. Headstrong, but selfless... and very brave.<eos> Arborlon could not have chosen a finer protector.<eos> You come back to us.<eos> I will.<eos> Is something bothering you?
I'm afraid not.<eos> Commander Tilton, take the prisoner back to her cell.<eos> What are you doing? I don't make deals with Rovers.<eos> Oh, I knew an Elvin bitch wouldn't keep her word.<eos> Let her go.<eos> This has gone far enough.<eos> You need to tell us what you know, Princess.<eos> Amberle... You saw Eretria in your vision.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Bandon told me when he touched you, he saw you and Eretria together.
If the Dagda Mor sends more Demons, we must be ready for them here.<eos> That is why you three... must travel to Safehold together.<eos> Do you recognize this?<eos> Go to hell.<eos> Oh, we might get there soon enough.<eos> "We"?<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.<eos> Much as I'd love to see you rot in that cell, the Ellcrys says you're part of the quest.<eos> What the hell is an Ellcrys?<eos> Lover boy can fill you in.
Yeah. It's not the Demons I'm worried about.<eos> I don't know about you, but... I'm feeling great about this plan.<eos> Move out!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Daddy's coming.<eos> Next, on "The Shannara Chronicles"...<eos> The Ellcrys and the princess are connected, but I can no longer sense her presence.<eos> - Let me help you.<eos> - You can't.<eos> They're of no use to you.
Previously, on The Shannara Chronicles.<eos> The Ellcrys seed must be carried to a place called Safehold.<eos> Do you remember the summer you sent us to the fort in Drey Wood?<eos> We met an Elf there named Rin Katsin.<eos> Send word to Drey Wood.<eos> I want Rin Katsin brought there immediately.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Something happen when people touch you?
Keep your eyes open.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Cozy place.<eos> I'm just saying, I think you were right about camping in the open.<eos> Maybe we should stay here for the night.<eos> The river won't make it much further.<eos> The horses could use a break.<eos> Then we press on.<eos> But her shackles stay on.<eos> You shouldn't let Crispin talk to you that way.
Nothing a little knockout powder can't handle.<eos> Stay in formation.<eos> Fill the gaps.<eos> What is that?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Bite down, big guy.<eos> You're gonna feel this.<eos> I can see it.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> I leave you alone for a couple of hours and look what happens.
What is that?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Bite down, big guy.<eos> You're gonna feel this.<eos> I can see it.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> I leave you alone for a couple of hours and look what happens.<eos> You completely fall apart.<eos> Looking good.<eos> What do they feed you boys in the Vale?
Bite down, big guy.<eos> You're gonna feel this.<eos> I can see it.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> I leave you alone for a couple of hours and look what happens.<eos> You completely fall apart.<eos> Looking good.<eos> What do they feed you boys in the Vale?<eos> Thought you'd be happy to see me.<eos> Just 'cause you did the right thing once in your life doesn't mean I trust you.
Let's go.<eos> Get down!<eos> Told you I had a plan.<eos> Having second thoughts, Prince?<eos> And third and fourth ones.<eos> With good reason.<eos> The Breakline is no place for an Elf.<eos> It's no place for anyone as long as Demons inhabit it.<eos> Diana. How did you know that I'd be here?<eos> Because when someone tells you no, you tend to do the opposite.
Diana. How did you know that I'd be here?<eos> Because when someone tells you no, you tend to do the opposite.<eos> If you're here to stop me, save your breath.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> What you're doing is treason.<eos> If you have a better idea, I'm all points.<eos> We do.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> The hell you are.<eos> Won't let these creatures take you as well.
You were across that line at Pykon.<eos> You could have easily left us there, but you didn't.<eos> You came back, you saved my life.<eos> Don't overthink it, Princess.<eos> You die, I don't get paid.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Fine, I do care.<eos> Why don't we braid each other's hair, have a party, talk about the boys we like?<eos> Sound good to you?
She's still here.<eos> We have to go.<eos> That's the window from my vision.<eos> Ending up here was no accident.<eos> This is how we find the Bloodfire.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Positive.<eos> Long time no see, Eretria.<eos> I always knew we'd meet again.<eos> Happy to see you too, Zora.
I thought this was destroyed after<eos> - the Second War of the Races.<eos> - So did I.<eos> But according to the Codex, it lies concealed in a vault beneath our city.<eos> Now the Druid must have known that.<eos> Why would he hide such a thing?<eos> You said he could be trusted, you said that he was the only one with the power to protect...<eos> I know what I said and I know what I've done.<eos> But if my fears are right, then we are vulnerable.<eos> I should have trusted you.
The evil everybody fears, but only you can see.<eos> Tell me, Druid, do you often commune with Demons?<eos> What is the meaning of this?<eos> Why conceal a weapon that has the power to protect us?<eos> To protect you?<eos> That sword is not a salvation, it is a talisman of evil.<eos> A darkness that is a danger to us all.<eos> It is you who are the danger, Druid.<eos> It was my mistake.<eos> I should have killed you the first time, Demon.
Together. Come on.<eos> One... two.<eos> Come on, we have to go.<eos> Is that the Wilderun?<eos> Damn straight!<eos> You've got to be kidding me!<eos> We blew that thing up!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Get Amberle out of here, now!<eos> We're not leaving you.
Eretria told me to expect traps out here.<eos> I will do anything to find her.<eos> But if we want to make it out of these woods alive, we need to be careful.<eos> We rest, then we eat.<eos> And then... then we keep looking.<eos> It's fading.<eos> So fast.<eos> That is why I need to know what you remember.<eos> You were in the presence of a powerful evil, fighting for your life.<eos> That kind of darkness, it can follow you.
Without training, you won't stand a chance of surviving the Darkness that is about to descend.<eos> Pie?<eos> - It's actually pretty delicious...<eos> - Stop it right there!<eos> Or I will kill you.<eos> A simple "no thanks" would be fine.<eos> You're not a prisoner.<eos> You can leave anytime you want.<eos> But you bought me as a slave.<eos> Okay, I understand how this might be a little confusing for you, but I only bought you to save you.
Well... then you should ask yourself.<eos> Or... you could just dance with me.<eos> - Hey, watch yourself!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Like I said, if he's not done with that Rover bitch by sunrise, then I'll kill her myself.<eos> What's the problem, Frances?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Don't go anywhere.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We came to rescue you.
Definitely.<eos> Have you done something to my friends?<eos> Utopia's peace has its price.<eos> The Trolls demand a toll each month.<eos> And your friends?<eos> They're going to pay it... so you don't have to.<eos> So you weren't saving me.<eos> You were going to... what?<eos> Sacrifice me to some damn Troll?<eos> No, that was before I knew you.
The Bloodfire is the earth's life force.<eos> It's where the past, present, and future meet.<eos> It is your destiny.<eos> But I don't understand.<eos> Why me?<eos> You were chosen, like I once was.<eos> Fate has tied us to the Ellcrys.<eos> As I end, you will begin.<eos> End?<eos> But I can save you, I have the seed.
Oh my God.<eos> Wil, what happened?<eos> You lost too much blood.<eos> I thought you were...<eos> But the stones brought you back.<eos> I guess you're a healer after all.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She didn't make it out.<eos> We need to open it back up.<eos> I warned you your feelings for Wil would hold you back.
I bought you some time.<eos> Use it!<eos> You can't do this.<eos> We have to go back together.<eos> No, you have to go back.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> We all have a part to play.<eos> I'm doing mine, and now it's up to you.<eos> Wil, stop.<eos> No, I'm not leaving you here.
Wil, stop.<eos> No, I'm not leaving you here.<eos> That's insane.<eos> Wil, it's not up to you.<eos> I'll come back for you, I promise.<eos> Go!<eos> Wil!<eos> Wil, we have to go.<eos> She wants us to go.<eos> I never meant to hurt you.
I need you to get me far away, somewhere where I can't hurt anybody.<eos> Bandon, I can't.<eos> Catania... do you trust me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then, get ready to scream.<eos> Give me the keys or I snap her neck.<eos> Now!<eos> Drop the sword.<eos> Step back.<eos> Just let us go, he's not going to hurt you.
Step back.<eos> Just let us go, he's not going to hurt you.<eos> Don't touch her!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Bandon, stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> He shouldn't have touched you.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Bandon, stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> He shouldn't have touched you.<eos> Nothing from the scouts.<eos> We should head down.<eos> The men will wanna see you.
Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Goodbye, brother.<eos> Secure the door!<eos> Keep moving!<eos> Run for the Ellcrys, now!<eos> Protect the princess.<eos> I told you we'd make it.<eos> All right, where's the seed?<eos> I tried to tell you earlier...
I saw him in there, Allanon.<eos> Even in that twisted form...<eos> it was Arion.<eos> He asked me to kill him.<eos> The Dagda Mor's cruelty had no bounds.<eos> Haven't been to the Sanctuary yet to see Amberle.<eos> I know her sacrifice saved us, but I just can't believe that she's gone.<eos> She is still with you, My Grace.<eos> She is watching over us all.<eos> For what it's worth, I'm grateful to you For showing me who I am.
-Come on-- -Don't touch my feet.<eos> I just think, it'd be good.<eos> I need you back. I need you to take care of me.<eos> And... and I was thinking about us... and... about my heart and how I feel about you.<eos> Come on, I know you.<eos> And I love you and you're so hot.<eos> And I just... I need you, Mama.<eos> Fine.<eos> Just shut the fuck up!<eos> I'll fuck you, but then you have to go.
I'm gonna read Crime and Punishment, all right?<eos> And you'll read Cujo, all right?<eos> That's what we'll do.<eos> And we'll see who can read the most pages without getting distracted.<eos> Ready to do that?<eos> Let's do that, okay?<eos> Cocaine, no cocaine, my attention will not be challenged.<eos> You got a real drug problem, Eric.<eos> What's that?<eos> Well, these are the drugs I have to take to deal with you.
Please don't tell me you think you and Natalie are gonna get back together.<eos> -'Cause that's never gonna happen. -Yeah.<eos> You're saying it... like, it's over?<eos> She cheated on you.<eos> Why would you wanna be with her?<eos> Gus, she sucked, man.<eos> Fuck Natalie.<eos> And fuck the Springwood.<eos> I think you'll find someone better.<eos> You know, I know you'll find someone better and if you have trouble, I can set you up.
Hello?<eos> Is this... is this one of those trick voicemail things?<eos> Mickey, is that you?<eos> God! Sorry!<eos> Your voice doesn't normally sound so message-y.<eos> No, it's me.<eos> We're gonna put Frozen on in one second, honey, I promise.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I don't know how to say this, uh...<eos> I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna come right out and say it to you, 'cause I respect you, okay, Rob?
-What the fuck are you wearing?<eos> I'm glad you made it.<eos> This is a really weird bar.<eos> It's not a bar.<eos> You haven't heard of Bliss House?<eos> What is this, like, a... like, a club for old people?<eos> It's a church. Well, they say it's... like a church for all churches, you know.<eos> It's more about oneness and togetherness, not so much a higher being.<eos> But I'm... I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?<eos> This is... this is how I'm trying to say I'm sorry to you.
So, was it incest when we had baths together as little girls?<eos> No, no, no, no, no. That is, like, worlds apart! Okay?<eos> Like, I was touching your boob while I was touching her thigh, okay?<eos> That's, technically, I'm--<eos> I'm in an incestuous relationship right now, okay?<eos> Don't judge us.<eos> I'm not judging you, okay? It's just... It's a surprise, and in all fairness... you two should've told me.<eos> Okay, dude.<eos> You know what?<eos> Sorry that we tried to fuck you. No.
This is pretty good lint.<eos> And what have you got planned for today?<eos> Oh, you know, the usual.<eos> - Monsters?<eos> - Of course.<eos> You think you can work in a fire-breathing chicken?<eos> The chicken again?<eos> The chicken is funny.<eos> A touch of comedy to balance the whole thing out.<eos> They're gonna be throwing money at you. I just know it.
Never forget how much he loved you, Kubo.<eos> He died protecting us.<eos> - Did the Moon King...<eos> - Uh. Your grandfather.<eos> Did Grandfather and your sisters really kill my father?<eos> It can't be true, can it?<eos> They're family.<eos> No, they are monsters.<eos> Grandfather and my sisters stole your eye, Kubo.<eos> They must never find you again.

Your grandfather.<eos> Did Grandfather and your sisters really kill my father?<eos> It can't be true, can it?<eos> They're family.<eos> No, they are monsters.<eos> Grandfather and my sisters stole your eye, Kubo.<eos> They must never find you again.<eos> Never!<eos> You must always stay hidden from the night sky, or they will find you and they'll take you away from me.
They must never find you again.<eos> Never!<eos> You must always stay hidden from the night sky, or they will find you and they'll take you away from me.<eos> Promise me you will never let this happen.<eos> Promise me, Kubo!<eos> Don't be sad, Kubo.<eos> Kubo?<eos> Remember what you must do, Kubo?<eos> Remember?<eos> Keep you with me at all times, Mr. Monkey.
Kubo.<eos> Kubo.<eos> Little boy.<eos> What happened to your eye?<eos> Who are you?<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> We are your family, Kubo.<eos> Your mother's sisters.<eos> And we've been looking for you for so long.<eos> It's so lovely to meet you, Kubo.
I don't understand what's happening!<eos> Who are you?<eos> You don't recognize me?<eos> All these years, you had to keep me in your pack.<eos> Well, now you know why.<eos> But you were a wooden charm.<eos> You were this big.<eos> I called that charm "Mr. Monkey."<eos> And if I were alive at that point, I might have found that insulting.<eos> Look, your mother used the last of her magic to save you and bring me to life.
- It smells.<eos> - Everything in here smells.<eos> - Drink it.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> I said drink it.<eos> You're a mean monkey, aren't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I am. And that's three.<eos> You're out of questions now, so just listen.<eos> I'm here to protect you, Kubo.
Okay, you better start taking this seriously, Kubo.<eos> This is real.<eos> This is not a story.<eos> Those things, your aunts, they never get hungry.<eos> They never sleep.<eos> They will find you!<eos> And if we're not prepared, they'll kill me and take your other eye.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> We're going to find the armor.<eos> It's the only thing that can protect you.
What are we gonna do?<eos> We're going to find the armor.<eos> It's the only thing that can protect you.<eos> So it's real. Really real.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm not going to keep it.<eos> I pulled that from her head.<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> Your mother was very powerful.<eos> She blessed your robes so that when the need was most, they would fly you away.
Oh, for crying out loud!<eos> I invoke the sword unbreakable!<eos> It broke.<eos> So, does it just mean the handle or...<eos> I'm a little disappointed with this magic sword.<eos> It's not the right sword, you idiot!<eos> Look!<eos> The sword!<eos> It's in his head.<eos> Hey! I've got a bone to pick with you.
Monkey, I think he's in trouble!<eos> We should help him.<eos> Kubo, your aunts are still out there. I'm sorry.<eos> But we have to head for shore.<eos> Kubo!<eos> Kubo.<eos> Look at this.<eos> I come fishing and all I reel in is a stinking ape.<eos> How pathetic that this filthy creature is all that's left of my sister's magic.<eos> This filthy creature will tear you apart!
He wants to make you just like him.<eos> Blind to humanity, as I once was.<eos> Only then can you take your place beside him as part of his family.<eos> Cold and hard.<eos> And perfect.<eos> I'll never be like him, never.<eos> I know.<eos> He's exhausted.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I'm not tucking you in.
Fly home, Kubo.<eos> Kubo?<eos> Is that you?<eos> You have to leave this place.<eos> The Moon King, he's coming.<eos> Grandfather!<eos> It's me, Kubo!<eos> I know you can see me!<eos> Hello, grandson.<eos> It's so good to see you at last.
To me, you're an object.<eos> You know, you're a thing.<eos> You're about as important to me as a cardboard box.<eos> And... the thing about cardboard boxes... is that... you know they're totally boring on the outside, right?<eos> But... sometimes, if you cut 'em open there'll be something interesting inside.<eos> You know, and so, while you're saying all these boring things to me I'm thinking about what it'd be like to cut you open.<eos> But I don't wanna... I don't wanna be that person.<eos> And so, I have a rule that anytime somebody says something to me where I think about, you know, cutting' 'em.<eos> I just smile and I say something nice.<eos> So that's why I say to you, Rob Anders, of 232, Carnation Street.
- Doesn't mean you can threaten to kill him.<eos> I didn't.<eos> And then there's what happened in the mortuary.<eos> What is it?<eos> What set you off?<eos> It all just feels so close.<eos> This is nowhere.<eos> It isn't supposed to happen here, it's supposed to be somewhere else.<eos> Let me ask you this.<eos> Who were you talking to just before Rob Anders upset you?
He'd like that.<eos> - Hi, John.<eos> - Hey, Brooke.<eos> You want some juice or hot chocolate?<eos> His stomach is bothering him.<eos> Do you think I could get him to go to the doctor?<eos> Or you could try this one.<eos> Mixture of rat poisoning and metal filings.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good to see you there.
So, what?<eos> It just means he's a dick to you too.<eos> Let's have dessert.<eos> I... two different pies. Whipped cream...<eos> Hello?<eos> - Who's there?<eos> - I sent you the note.<eos> Shit.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> You know so much about me, then you know what I'll do when I find you.
So, what have you been up to?<eos> I barely seen you since the holidays.<eos> What does a young psychotic John Wayne Cleaver do in his spare time?<eos> Hello?<eos> Earth to John.<eos> Wanna tell me what the crap's going on, man?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> I just... I need to do normal stuff right now.<eos> Do you wanna play the game?<eos> Why are you here, John? On Christmas night, when I haven't seen you in not one week, but two weeks?
It's 10,000, not 20 like we agreed.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What's everybody else gonna be doing at this dinner?<eos> Admiring our philanthropy?<eos> They see our chunk and then they pony up.<eos> I mean, 10's barely gonna get us the roof.<eos> Wait, who's doing this roof?<eos> Michelangelo?<eos> Look, we agreed to 20.<eos> I'm asking you for half. Can you just cut the goddamn check?
They were a bunch of prima goddamn ballerinas in whatever Slovakatinia they come from.<eos> Well, now they're gonna be living in our basement.<eos> Good thing they don't eat much, dancers.<eos> Get out of my fucking bedroom.<eos> What?<eos> This is what I had.<eos> This is what you threw me like a child.<eos> Go play with the dance troupe, Dev.<eos> They need your brilliant fucking strategizing.<eos> You know, it'll be great for you. Get you out of the house.
I fucking love this city.<eos> A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [Marseille Theme Tune: Arabic vocals over pulsing rhythm]<eos> 20 YEARS [crowd roars]<eos> -Wasn't that beautiful?<eos> -Fantastic.<eos> Marseille is winning. Any comment?<eos> You never miss a pass, do you?<eos> No comment.<eos> Are you coming home with me or not?<eos> No, Fred will drop you off.
Just a minute.<eos> [Julia] The cops carried out a raid at Félix Pyat yesterday.<eos> -I'm on it.<eos> -I have a friend who can get me in.<eos> Can I take it?<eos> -If you use your real name.<eos> -Crimsonne is my mother's name.<eos> But not your father's.<eos> You've been saying that for six months.<eos> I'll call you back.
-I hope so.<eos> Four people may vote with me.<eos> -Good.<eos> -Goodbye.<eos> -Shall I come with you? -Yes.<eos> [Éric] Come on--<eos> [Julia] Stop it. I didn't come here for that.<eos> I need to write my article.<eos> [Éric] It's okay.<eos> I'll introduce you to the guys later.
[Taro] Care to explain?<eos> [Barrès] I don't know.<eos> [Taro] This is a betrayal.<eos> By voting against the casino, you betrayed me.<eos> And Marseille.<eos> [Barrès] You maybe, but not Marseille.<eos> The city doesn't belong to you.<eos> [Julia] Forget about Barrès.<eos> He'll screw anything with a pulse.<eos> I swear, he'll drop you like dirt.
But still, it's a stressful time for him...<eos> If it's not cocaine, what is it?<eos> [Osmont] It's the hand, Rachel.<eos> You mean my hand?<eos> Is it arthritis?<eos> [Osmont] It's more than that.<eos> Paralysis? I'll have to stop playing?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Thank you for telling me the truth.
They're brand new.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Antía.<eos> Two sons and a daughter.<eos> She went down to Lake Como to shop.<eos> Maybe she lives nearby, in a Swiss town that's expensive and she went shopping in Italy which is much cheaper.<eos> She doesn't wear make-up.<eos> She's thin.<eos> She thinks I still live in Madrid.<eos> Dear Antía, I'm going to tell you everything I wasn't able to tell you, because you were a child, because it was too painful for me, or simply out of shame.
She doesn't wear make-up.<eos> She's thin.<eos> She thinks I still live in Madrid.<eos> Dear Antía, I'm going to tell you everything I wasn't able to tell you, because you were a child, because it was too painful for me, or simply out of shame.<eos> But you're not a child anymore.<eos> Beatriz told me that you have children of your own.<eos> Three, no less.<eos> You're a grown woman, and a mother.<eos> Where do I begin?<eos> I'll tell you about your father.
I never imagined that your wife...<eos> Don't think about that now.<eos> Good morning.<eos> - These cookies are so good!<eos> - They're typical of here.<eos> I was fixing breakfast.<eos> I was really hungry.<eos> Anything for me?<eos> We'll find something...<eos> I took your letter as an invitation to come and see you.
So man was born naked, defenseless, in the midst of nature.<eos> I'm pregnant, Ava.<eos> By whom?<eos> By Xoan.<eos> I was pregnant when I came here.<eos> Does he know?<eos> I don't want to pressure him.<eos> You have to tell him.<eos> Xoan adores children.<eos> When you were born, I took you to your grandparents, so they could meet you and Xoan.
Look at her.<eos> She's so big!<eos> She's two years old.<eos> Two years...<eos> Antía, come here. I've got some lovely strawberries.<eos> Not now, Dad. I've just put a clean dress on her.<eos> Have you nothing to say to Mom?<eos> You look beautiful, Sara.<eos> - I've got all the jars.<eos> - Dad, may I speak to you?
It's no life for Mom.<eos> We're as well as we can be.<eos> You know what it would cost to put your mother in a residence?<eos> I thought you'd hired a woman to look after her.<eos> Sanáa looks after her.<eos> Sanáa looks after the land and you.<eos> Don't go there.<eos> Mom needs more than someone to wash her and make the bed.<eos> You have your life, unfortunately very far from here.<eos> I've tried not to bother you too much, but we've had lots of problems.
It's Antía.<eos> She wants to talk to you, from the camp.<eos> You have to talk to her.<eos> Antía... Mom, it's me.<eos> What's wrong with your phone?<eos> I've called loads of times and you don't answer.<eos> I mustn't have heard it.<eos> How are you, darling?<eos> Great.<eos> Ava and I will pick you up tomorrow.
You made me rent it.<eos> By then I was worn out, but you were as strong as an ox.<eos> You had suddenly grown up.<eos> You went back home with Ava, to close it and put it up for sale.<eos> In Madrid, Bea looked after me.<eos> I wouldn't have survived without you two.<eos> When you came back, we didn't talk much about the trip.<eos> You didn't want to make me sad, and I didn't have the strength to ask.<eos> Come on, Mom.<eos> We're going to stand you up.
If we're going to eat something, hurry up.<eos> I'm meeting Bea to study.<eos> - Do you like how it's turning out?<eos> I think I'll do the sitting room tomorrow.<eos> Don't bother, I've got used to the wallpaper and Bea loves it.<eos> Bea has a beautiful, vanilla-colored house, and she doesn't have to live here.<eos> Shall I fix you a sandwich?<eos> Okay, but hurry.<eos> I got over the depression with your help and I found a job I could do at home, proofreading.<eos> I dedicated the rest of my time to you.
Where is she?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> What matters is that Antía is better than ever and very happy.<eos> If you stop thinking about yourself and think about her, you should be happy.<eos> You can't tell me that.<eos> Don't despair.<eos> Perhaps she'll decide to contact you, but give her time.<eos> I reported your disappearance to the police,<eos> I hired a private detective.<eos> During the first months all I did was look for you in every possible way.
Hello, Dad.<eos> Hello, Julieta.<eos> Did you see the photo I sent you?<eos> Yes, I'm looking at it now.<eos> Isn't your brother handsome?<eos> Yes, he certainly is.<eos> When will you come and meet him?<eos> I can't now, Dad. I told you I'm very busy.<eos> I'm sorry, I have to hang up.<eos> I'll call you.
We didn't talk much, that's true.<eos> But teenagers are mysterious, and I didn't want to burden her.<eos> Please...<eos> The day she left, Antía rang me.<eos> Ava, how are you?<eos> Messed up.<eos> I got the diagnosis.<eos> Multiple sclerosis.<eos> But don't tell your mother. I'll call her.<eos> Ava, I'd like to talk to you, but this may not be the time.
Why did she feel guilty?<eos> She'd gone away and had been happy at the camp.<eos> I told her none of us was to blame for what happened.<eos> Even if we were guilty, we'd suffered enough punishment.<eos> Then Antía said: "We all get what we deserve. "<eos> I raised you in the same freedom in which my parents had raised me.<eos> When we moved to Madrid and I fell into that depression, I never told you, but I was suffocated by a tremendous sense of guilt about your father's death and that of the man on the train.<eos> I never talked to you about it. I wanted you to grow up free from guilt.<eos> But you sensed it.<eos> And despite my silence, I infected you like a virus.
"I have a friend you must meet. "<eos> Ava bequeathed me Lorenzo.<eos> I never told him about you.<eos> There wasn't a single trace of you in the house.<eos> You didn't exist.<eos> I started a new life with him.<eos> Days became weeks. The weeks, months and years.<eos> There were days I didn't think about you.<eos> When a former addict relapses just once, no matter how many years he is clean, the relapse is fatal.<eos> I abstained from you for years, but I made the mistake of relapsing into the hope of finding you or hearing about you.
Those two girls reminded me of you and Antía.<eos> They're my nieces.<eos> But what's happened?<eos> The last time you were so well...<eos> When we met, I didn't tell you...<eos> I haven't seen Antía for 12 years.<eos> Twelve years?<eos> Did you really see her like you said?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> But I didn't tell you that it was very unpleasant.
Why?<eos> Antía didn't want to talk to me.<eos> She did all she could to avoid me.<eos> She said she didn't know me, that I'd mistaken her for someone else.<eos> But I knew it was her.<eos> In the end, she had no choice but to talk to me.<eos> Is it true about the children?<eos> Yes, three.<eos> She had two of them with her.<eos> Why didn't she want to talk to you?
- I did not bid you speak.<eos> Nervous?<eos> What man would not be?<eos> To leave his father's house on a day of glory and go to dwell with a rival?<eos> What man would be at ease knowing that some might doubt his motives?<eos> Dwelling in a traitor's camp.<eos> "Spy," some might whisper.<eos> Eyes of the empire upon him.<eos> What man would not stand here atremble before his father and Khan?<eos> I'll tell you which man.
That's when I realized just how formidable ally my Chabi would become.<eos> I sniffed your cheek.<eos> And you stabbed me with an elk-horn knife.<eos> And I will do it again if you don't come out and give the royal blessing like the Khan you are.<eos> Brother.<eos> You would call me "brother" now?<eos> The news was coming.<eos> The only question was who carried it.<eos> Better a stranger than to be stabbed by blood.<eos> I wish you well, brother, always.
So I hope that it does rain.<eos> I'm gonna go set out your dress.<eos> If anyone needs anything, I'll be upstairs in the boudoir.<eos> I love tents.<eos> This is the day.<eos> This is my wedding day.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - Good, how you doing?<eos> - Mm, good.<eos> Good to see you.
You have to go tell him to leave, and then you have to tell Hannah that she's been so inappropriate and unsupportive for me all day.<eos> Wouldn't you rather do that?<eos> That kind of just seems like something that you would really enjoy doing.<eos> - Shosh. - Okay, on it.<eos> - ...had breakfast yet.<eos> - What do you mean,<eos> - you didn't order it or it didn't show up?<eos> - I mean it was fine...<eos> No, no one just mentioned breakfast.<eos> Fran... um, so, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, just 'cause it's women's hour.
That was such a treat.<eos> She is like a little angel.<eos> She let me bring my 30-year-old daughter along and we had a ball.<eos> I gotta tell you what, those Bushes know how to party.<eos> You have a 30-year-old daughter?<eos> - When did you have her?<eos> - Oh, God, I don't know.<eos> Okay, well, let's just talk about the aesthetic of the wedding.<eos> - Okay. - We're thinking Laurel Canyon classic.<eos> So, does that mean anything to you?
Well, you know, I was on the Vans Warped Tour this summer and I saw Vanessa Hudgens in the pit and she had one of these crowns on and you look just like her.<eos> Well, that's just great and weird.<eos> Just when we ask for second opinions, we'll come to you right away, okay?<eos> - We're good. - Okay.<eos> And this is my daughter and this is my day.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna start on someone else while you two work this thing out, all right?<eos> - Okay. - Good idea.<eos> - Okay, good. - Okay, yeah, that's good.<eos> - She's crazy.<eos> - I'm gonna kill you.
- I suppose I am, sir.<eos> Yes, well, I'll leave you to it.<eos> Impudent puppy.<eos> Quite shy-making, all this, isn't it?<eos> But you're not shy.<eos> Indeed I am.<eos> I'm petrified of your father.<eos> He's so fierce.<eos> He has a quick temper.<eos> Does he beat you?
Quite shy-making, all this, isn't it?<eos> But you're not shy.<eos> Indeed I am.<eos> I'm petrified of your father.<eos> He's so fierce.<eos> He has a quick temper.<eos> Does he beat you?<eos> No!<eos> Well, that's... something, isn't it?<eos> Does your father beat you?
When?<eos> No!<eos> When I've heard from your father that you've learnt to behave yourself, then I'll give you my hand to kiss!<eos> Well, then, I shall wish you ladies goodnight.<eos> How did it go?<eos> She's damnably dull looking, isn't she, poor little thing!<eos> But did she like you?<eos> Oh, yes, I think so.<eos> And could you put up with her, do you think?<eos> To please you, Papa?
Those lights!<eos> That's our house!<eos> Wake up!<eos> We're here!<eos> Already?<eos> Nikki!<eos> Nikki!<eos> My darling boy!<eos> I didn't know you'd be here so soon!<eos> Well, I wanted to surprise you!
Yes.<eos> Let's find you something to eat!<eos> Is this one yours, Nikolai?<eos> That one's mine.<eos> Nikolai, are you awake?<eos> Come out, I want to talk to you!<eos> Look, Denisov's sabre!<eos> He killed four Frenchmen with this!<eos> Close the door, Petya!<eos> Come out, Nikki, I want to talk to you!
Yes. Yes, he is.<eos> It was so kind of you to take him in.<eos> Well, one does what one can.<eos> Splendid fellow.<eos> It's so good to be here with you all again.<eos> What is it, Pierre?<eos> Why are you sad?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> I'm not sad.<eos> Just happy to see you.
Hurrah!<eos> The choir will now sing a cantata in praise of our great General and souvenir copies of the music will be distributed.<eos> To the husbands of pretty women!<eos> Hear, hear!<eos> To the health of beautiful women!<eos> To the health of beautiful women, Petrushka, and their lovers!<eos> Don't you dare take what is mine!<eos> Really, Petrushka, what is the matter?<eos> Scoundrel!<eos> I challenge you!

You guys have destroyed everything, and that's why it looks junkier, like a couple of locusts.<eos> Oh, I take that as a compliment.<eos> It's not a compliment.<eos> Well, it's biblical, so it's a compliment.<eos> Yeah.<eos> (stammers) Why is everything so goddamn expensive?<eos> I wish we hadn't burned down our rent-controlled apartment.<eos> (both laugh)<eos> Yeah, you think?<eos> Dee, I will slap you in the teeth.
'Cause I'm standing outside in the hot one.<eos> Thanks a lot, Wally.<eos> You know what?<eos> Tell me about future weather.<eos> Don't tell me about present weather...<eos> Oh, I didn't realize we had company.<eos> Hey, Dennis.<eos> This is Jimmy-- he's the pool guy.<eos> I invited him over for dinner.<eos> Mac, can I speak to you in the foyer for a second?
You fat pig!<eos> How you doing, neighbor?<eos> (whirring) ♪ Does that make me crazy?<eos> ♪<eos> Shut up!<eos> (chirping)<eos> ♪ Does that make me crazy?<eos> ♪<eos> ♪ Does that make me crazy?<eos> DENNIS: I'm not letting you in, pig!
It's getting real hot around here.<eos> So hot, Wally.<eos> But you don't really know what hot is, do you?<eos> Hot's a storm.<eos> You ever been in a storm, Wally?<eos> I mean, a real storm?<eos> Not a thunderstorm, but a storm of fists raining down on your head.<eos> Blasting you in the face.<eos> Pummeling you in the stomach.<eos> Hitting you in the chest so hard you think your heart's gonna stop.
- Cool.<eos> You can't have a boy in your bed.<eos> - You do.<eos> - I'm a grown-up.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Why are you taping horse to my tummy?<eos> 'Cause I'm your uncle, and you do what I say.<eos> Carl? I sentence you to the maximum: one year at the Illinois Department of Corrections
Why, when we had just found each other?<eos> Is God really so vengeful?<eos> Why is he punishing me with this torment?<eos> All right, ten Hail Marys and light a candle.<eos> Ten?<eos> Really?<eos> Just ten?<eos> All right, 20.<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> Do you want me to tell you to flog yourself with a cat-o'-nine-tails, make you wear a hair shirt?
Heh-hey. - What are you doing home, huh? - Yo.<eos> No 40-year-old professor coochie on the menu tonight, bro?<eos> Hey, you know about that?<eos> Dude, you've been sneaking her in here a couple times a week.<eos> I heard she might be fucing somebody new.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Where'd you hear that?<eos> Around.<eos> Hey, probably just a rumor, you know, but you should definitely be lining up some age-appropriate dorm snatch.<eos> Have it in your pocket for when, uh, Professor Kinky balls on you.
- All right. - These my eggs? - Mm-hmm.<eos> He didn't even make a wish.<eos> So, Carl... a lot of the kids in there having to take it up the ass to survive?<eos> - Kevin. - What?<eos> That's what everybody's thinking, right?<eos> Mm. That's my sleepover.<eos> He didn't answer.<eos> This is Nick.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> All right, I'll show you around the crib later.
Yeah, I know.<eos> I was feeling a little sorry for myself.<eos> Did you remember her from class?<eos> Not really very memorable. Is she?<eos> Oh. What are you doing, Frank?<eos> I'm just watching you sleep.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ, you're really starting to creep me out.<eos> Are you looking out for yourself?<eos> Doing breast self-exams?<eos> You know, cancer can sneak up on you.
- I hear you.<eos> All right.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Why do you need to put a nail in the tyre?<eos> I want it so neither of us can change our minds.<eos> We came back early.<eos> Polly didn't finish the count yesterday.<eos> Hmm, so you thought you could take a tenner.<eos> I thought I'd finish the count.<eos> Esme, I've told you, stay off the snow till the baby's born.
I thought I'd finish the count.<eos> Esme, I've told you, stay off the snow till the baby's born.<eos> It does no harm, passes the time...<eos> Knocks down the walls!<eos> Listen...<eos> I know you miss the travelling.<eos> But it's going to be all right.<eos> It's like being a hen in a coop!<eos> Remember that house in Lichfield?<eos> Eh? The one the bailiff used to throw you out of?

- This is the game we used to play.<eos> - No!<eos> Watch.<eos> Do not fucking do this...<eos> No...<eos> Look at me.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> NO!<eos> Give me that fucking thing!<eos> It brings you alive!
Do as I say.<eos> If there is a call after midnight, the maid who comes in is the one in love with the master...<eos> This is NOT FUCKING RUSSIA!<eos> (Please, Mary...<eos> Go back to bed. Eh? )<eos> I know your weakness, Tommy.<eos> It's freedom.<eos> Madness.<eos> Killing.<eos> I am the first one... .. who understands you.
She said there was going to be a killing.<eos> A holy man.<eos> And she was with the Shelbys, was she?<eos> I suppose you have something to say about yesterday.<eos> No.<eos> It's something else, actually.<eos> I believe Arthur has told you about some business we're planning, Linda.<eos> Oh, there's always business, Thomas.<eos> And Arthur believes, when this business is done, it'll all be over.<eos> Arthur believes you, but I don't.
- 'What?<eos> ' - Did John make a list?<eos> - 'Speak clearer, Tom.'<eos> - I said, "Did John make a list?" - 'John Boy!<eos> John! '<eos> Right...<eos> 'Gypsies and kin only.<eos> Yeah.'<eos> Good.<eos> 'Tommy, can I ask you why?
Ada, stop...<eos> OK.<eos> OK...<eos> Drive me to a hospital, Ada.<eos> If I'm not conscious when I get there, tell them I have a fractured skull, concussion and internal bleeding.<eos> - I think I may have haemorrhaged. - Tommy! - Ada, go on.<eos> Be quick, cos I can't see.<eos> I can't fucking see...<eos> Except for you, Dad...<eos> I can see you.
(man whimpering)<eos> Welcome, everyone.<eos> The world sees criminal lunatics.<eos> I see brilliance.<eos> Theo Galavan, the new mayor of Gotham!<eos> No!<eos> Mother!<eos> Any last words?<eos> OSWALD:<eos> I'm going to kill you.
You hear me?<eos> !<eos> This way, please.<eos> A lot of business going on.<eos> The warden get a cut?<eos> Almost there.<eos> I want the Boy Scout dead by week's end.<eos> Damn.<eos> You look good, brother.<eos> This place agrees with you.
Tell me what?<eos> Lee lost the baby, Jim.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> How is she?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> I think she's fine.<eos> She moved down south.<eos> No one's heard from her since.<eos> Hey, don't let this beat you.<eos> It's good to see you, Harv.

There's so much I haven't told you.<eos> So much that I'm ashamed of.<eos> I was a criminal.<eos> I've done... horrible things.<eos> Hurt people, manipulated, lied.<eos> For power, for revenge.<eos> I've killed people, Father.<eos> Our lives together started the moment I met you at the cemetery.<eos> Nothing before that concerns me.<eos> I forgive you for all your past transgressions.
You're dead.<eos> You understand?<eos> You understand?<eos> !<eos> You're dead, pig.<eos> We're gonna need a body bag.<eos> Bullock?<eos> - What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - What's it look like we're doing?<eos> We're getting you out of here.
Don Falcone had all the contacts inside of Blackgate.<eos> He made this whole thing happen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm not sure I can ever repay you.<eos> It won't be necessary.<eos> I'm happy to help an old friend.<eos> What now?<eos> You're asking me?<eos> Two hours ago, I was a dead man.<eos> I have people that will get you out of the country.

- You killed people before, blood?<eos> - No.<eos> But no one's killed my parents before.<eos> Well, Matches has killed dozens of people.<eos> Men, women... children...<eos> He's a professional.<eos> And what, exactly, are you?<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> Course I know where he is; he's a friend of mine.<eos> You gonna give me a good reason to tell you where he is?
We'll see about your clever little plan, Jim Gordon.<eos> I can make plans of my own.<eos> Hello, Officer Pinkney.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> Murder weapon was a crowbar.<eos> - Your fingerprints were on it.<eos> - I was set up!<eos> Being convicted for murder has its downsides.<eos> Good to see you, Harv.
- Hmm. - Mainly Loeb loyalists.<eos> Who knows... maybe Loeb himself is behind this.<eos> Before you go down that rabbit hole, I got to say something to you as a friend, hmm?<eos> You can still run.<eos> Go to an island, buy a banana boat, grow a beard, find Lee, have a life.<eos> Look, I've been working this thing since you went away.<eos> And I'm not saying it's hopeless.<eos> But Barnes is on the hunt.<eos> You don't have much time.<eos> He threaten you?
Cops, right?<eos> Jerks.<eos> Nygma said he met Penguin for the first time in the woods.<eos> That's right around the same time his girlfriend went missing.<eos> I think he was burying her.<eos> Just like he was going to bury me.<eos> What, you want to find her body?<eos> Touch of the old needle in a haystack, innit?<eos> Nygma knows where she is.<eos> What, and you think he's gonna, what, straight tell you?
This is who I am.<eos> It was just finally admitting the truth to myself.<eos> Well, that and murdering some people.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> You don't believe it.<eos> Why, Jim?<eos> 'Cause it would make you incompetent to know that I was right under your nose the whole time?<eos> Or you don't want to admit that there's a monster in all of us?<eos> Because you, of all people, should know that!<eos> That's what made it so easy to frame you!
The Lady.<eos> You're investigating the Wayne murder, huh? I've heard of her.<eos> You think she's involved?<eos> 'Cause I could help you with this.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Okay, well, maybe it was a mistake to come, but listen.<eos> Could you just do one more thing for me?<eos> Could you say my name?<eos> Good-bye, Barbara.<eos> Jim will catch you up.
No. I-I-I don't know.<eos> By who?<eos> No. No, we... we weren't followed.<eos> Good.<eos> Then you can leave.<eos> Not until you answer my questions.<eos> I know my father came to talk to you about something called Pinewood Farms.<eos> God, you don't know anything, do you?<eos> So tell me.<eos> Do you not understand that these people will kill you?
That's, uh, the man who ran the program.<eos> That's what the others called him.<eos> Something about some game they played.<eos> And you could identify him?<eos> - Good.<eos> We have someone tracking down the files of all the scientists who have worked for Wayne Enterprises over the years.<eos> After that, you, you can disappear.<eos> No one will ever hurt you again.<eos> You sound just like him.<eos> I have been hiding something from you, Bruce.
- Previously on Gotham...<eos> - Oh, crud.<eos> He killed my mother, Jim.<eos> He had her murdered in front of me.<eos> I am going to kill you.
This is my business, too.<eos> I can't make the moves I need to make if I'm worrying about you.<eos> You need to be at home, where Alfred can look after you.<eos> Hello, Grace.<eos> How are you today?<eos> Incredibly, the attacker fled the crime scene by, for all intents and purposes, scaling the side of the structure, literally disappearing into thin air.<eos> In all my years, Ken, I must say, I've never seen anything quite like it.<eos> That a human being should be capable of such feats, it just astounds the mind. Huh.<eos> ... Theo Galavan, the new mayor of Gotham!<eos> Oh, brother, like I don't know you from way back.
- He's a very dangerous man.<eos> - Basement?<eos> Alive people, dead people, dead-alive people... it's horrible.<eos> Okay, how do I get there?<eos> Wow, it's like I'm saying things, and you're just not hearing them.<eos> He has a friend of mine, and I'm here to get her out.<eos> Now, how... do... I get... there?<eos> You'll tell me the way out?<eos> There's an elevator.<eos> I'll tell you where it is, but... can you pick a lock?
You're all right.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Can you tell me who you are?<eos> Can you tell me... your name?<eos> Who am I?<eos> What is my name?<eos> Yeah. Amazing.<eos> The octopod DNA we introduced provides exactly the effect I was looking for.<eos> Rest now, son.<eos> I'll return momentarily to tell you who you are.
True.<eos> But he wouldn't be dead, either.<eos> Along with your mother.<eos> Are those ideals that your father cherished so worth it?<eos> Wouldn't you gladly trade everything you believe for one more day, one more hour, with your parents alive?<eos> So you admit it, then.<eos> You admit what you did.<eos> Here's what I admit, Bruce.<eos> That I was your father's friend.<eos> That I pleaded with him, as I plead with you now:
Fire cannot touch me.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> You're the Goddess of Fire, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Goddesses have servants and stuff.<eos> Let me be your servant.<eos> Why do I need a servant?<eos> You can't be a goddess without a servant.<eos> Come on, it's totally part of the story.<eos> The Professor just forgot to tell you.
How are things going for you?<eos> We've had a hell of a time.<eos> The same.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm a little groggy.<eos> He drugged me.<eos> Made me talk.<eos> About Wayne Enterprises, right?<eos> About everything.<eos> I never should have made that oath to you.
Always have.<eos> Be that as it may... if you can escape, do it.<eos> Manipulative.<eos> As if.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> She'll do what she likes.<eos> And there's a bomb.<eos> Hello, number 13.<eos> Stay calm.<eos> No one's going to hurt you.
I just want to be a papa.<eos> Okay, yeah, so, hey, this is awesome.<eos> You're gonna have a baby.<eos> I know!<eos> And you're gonna be its best friend.<eos> Ah, well, based on the age diff, maybe more of a fun uncle/mentor.<eos> Baby's best friend.<eos> All right, so... nonnegotiable.<eos> Here's the deal, Steven.<eos> We already got you on shoplifting.
Are we still holding out hope that this might work?<eos> I am. Let's give her a shot.<eos> I feel like you and me are really bonding.<eos> I'm ready to give you immunity.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> That's not happening!<eos> Gina, come out of there.<eos> Negative. The guy wanted to talk to a real person, not a cop.<eos> That's why he asked for me.<eos> Actually, I asked for you because we went to high school together.
Hi there. I'm Jake.<eos> This is my best friend, Charles.<eos> He's trying to have a baby.<eos> You get it.<eos> Charles, I know you're mad, but you have to talk to me.<eos> It's funny how getting tased in the back can break your heart and also really hurt your back.<eos> I'm sorry. I really wanted to be a papa, and you ruined it.<eos> You pop-blocked me.<eos> I know, but I couldn't let you break the law.<eos> And I won't let Eleanor turn you into a bad person.
My legs stopped working.<eos> [grunting] Ah, my testicles.<eos> The mumps have reached my testicles.<eos> - All right, just finish taking off your totally ineffective biohazard suits and have a little rest.<eos> - Nonsense, Santiago.<eos> We just have to buckle down and work harder.<eos> We simply hit a bump in the road.<eos> - More like a mump in the road.<eos> - Such a good one.<eos> Jake, can I talk to you in private for a minute?
Things don't burn down like they used to.<eos> - I'm just gonna put it out.<eos> - Well, you know, it's good enough for Diane Keaton.<eos> It's good enough for me.<eos> - I love her.<eos> I mean, she's no Jane Seymour.<eos> Where is Jane Seymour now, anyway?<eos> - She makes jewelry, and it's beautiful.<eos> I just bought two brooches for the lesbians across the street.<eos> - Mom, I keep telling you, if you don't rein it in a little bit, you're gonna scare them off.
Hey, Karen, can I talk to you for a second in private?<eos> I'm a little plugged up.<eos> - Oh, well, say no more.<eos> I have an entire cabinet devoted just to that.<eos> - Wow. TMI, you guys.<eos> [chuckles] [mouthing] Thank you.<eos> - Oh, man, this is so much fun.<eos> Thanks for giving me a second chance, buddy.<eos> - Second chance?<eos> Are you seriously not getting what I'm charades-ing down at you?
Thanks for giving me a second chance, buddy.<eos> - Second chance?<eos> Are you seriously not getting what I'm charades-ing down at you?<eos> That was you and Sheila Bodden humping it up in the back of our car.<eos> - What?<eos> I-- - Yeah, that's right.<eos> I saw you. I saw your weird dad butt, and I saw her aquamarine leotard bunched up around her ankles!<eos> It scarred me for life.<eos> - I'm sorry. I--I didn't know you saw that.<eos> - Yeah, well, I did, and I never told Mom about it, but I swear to you, I will unless you leave right now.
- Okay, you don't have to put so much mustard on it.<eos> - And I haven't met anyone I like.<eos> But I like your father.<eos> And I know he has been a selfish jerk, but he really has changed.<eos> Last month when I had bronchitis, he flew in on his day off just to bring me soup.<eos> It was this weird Canadian soup.<eos> I-I think it was just all cheese.<eos> But it was really nice.<eos> - [sighs] Man, I feel stupid.<eos> I was just trying to protect you, but I clearly made everything worse.
- Well, well, well. Look who's trying to skip town.<eos> - You told me to.<eos> - Right.<eos> Look, I talked to Mom, and I just want her to be happy.<eos> So can we go back to my birthday party now?<eos> - I'd love that, son.<eos> This is nice.<eos> - If you screw this up and hurt her in any way, I will throw you in jail for the rest of your life, and I can do that now, Dad, so do not test me.<eos> - I still liked the hug even though you used it to threaten me.<eos> - Yeah, well... I kind of liked threatening you, so...
One, two, three, four.<eos> ♪ ♪ - Congratulations.<eos> We did it.<eos> And we did it together because we're a team.<eos> - Should we do it again next week, sir?<eos> - No. I would hate that.<eos> - [sighs] - Hey, honey.<eos> Thanks for bringing Roger back.<eos> - You're very welcome.<eos> Hey, by the way, Amy was really nervous to meet you, so don't judge her too harshly for all the weird singing.
This is a sensitive matter, and I can only disclose details to the lead detective on the case.<eos> Sergeant, let me know who's available, ASAP.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sarge, Sarge, Sarge.<eos> You know that I'm your guy for this.<eos> You can't give a celebrity case to Amy.<eos> The last movie she saw was a documentary about spelling bees.<eos> Wrong; it was about the font Helvetica, and it played like an action thriller.<eos> You already have a case, Peralta.<eos> I assigned it to you this morning.
Hmm, I saw you perform Bach's "Oboe Sonata in G Minor"<eos> at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.<eos> I was in the front row.<eos> You were escorted out for gasping too loudly.<eos> Ah.<eos> This is a pretty modest apartment.<eos> How did you afford a $40,000 oboe in the first place?<eos> I admit that there's not as much money in classical music as there once was...<eos> Which is the real crime here.<eos> Boyle, can I talk to you privately?
Oh, no, now I'm starting to panic sweat.<eos> Starting to?<eos> What have you been doing for the past hour?<eos> - Normal sweating.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> If you get killed, what happens to all your debt?<eos> Loophole!<eos> Oh, you sweaty, chair-spinning morons.<eos> You're gonna get us out of here.<eos> Boyle, may I speak to you?
I think I've figured out a way to make it up to you.<eos> Oh, my God, is Dianne Wiest here?<eos> No, I've hired a trio of classical musicians to perform a Shostakovich cantata, originally written as an apology to a dear friend.<eos> Are you stealing kitchen supplies?<eos> Just let us have this stuff.<eos> You have so much, and we have so little.<eos> Perhaps I'll just buy you a drink instead.<eos> Yeah, that would be best.<eos> Classical musicians are savages.<eos> They're not gonna kill you fast, Scully.

I knew I wasn't ready to go back to being police.<eos> It's the only job I've ever had except for bagging groceries at the supermarket at the corner of Atlantic and Clinton.<eos> I guess I could go back to that again.<eos> "Paper or plastic?"<eos> Yeah, still got it.<eos> Listen to me, I was undercover.<eos> 63 days with the Mafia.<eos> I saw some messed-up stuff.<eos> I know what your struggle is.<eos> And I can bring you home, but you've got to trust me.
They'd kill us all if they were smart enough to use weapons, but you're not smart.<eos> You're dumb.<eos> You're always naked, and you pee in a box.<eos> I suppose they're not totally naked with the fur.<eos> Anyways, you know how you didn't solve that case 20 years ago?<eos> Thanks for reminding me.<eos> You don't see me bringing up how you burned your junk off.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> There was just some light blistering.<eos> The point is, the only thing those bullies have over you is that you never solved that case.
Yes! Don't listen to him.<eos> You're a part of something much bigger than yourselves.<eos> Well, good morning, Linetti.<eos> Whoo, I slept like a frickin' baby last night.<eos> Staying at Chuck's is like a dream.<eos> Little guy loves doting on me, although you're gonna need to buy some bigger underwear if we're gonna be sharing, you know what I mean?<eos> Okay, I'll get right on that.<eos> Here. Take care of this for me, will you?<eos> Yeah. I'm gonna go get some breakfast candy.<eos> Okay, catch you later.
They were Nortfluskers bran circles!<eos> I had them shipped from Oslo.<eos> Oh, I want him out.<eos> But I'm too scared to tell him.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> I know that your spirit animal is a caterpillar that's been stepped on...<eos> - Mm-hmm. - But mine is the mighty wolf.<eos> And if you want to beat an alpha, you have to be an alpha.<eos> Wrongo.<eos> If you're good enough at being a beta, then the alpha takes mercy on you and ends up giving you what you want.
Uh-oh. What are you doing, man?<eos> Nothing!<eos> I have high cholesterol!<eos> My wife says I cannot have red meat, so they sneak in my beef stew.<eos> Please don't shoot.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It happened again.<eos> Only this guy's sitting on a toilet instead of a wheelchair.<eos> That's even more dumb.<eos> Here, here, Terry. Move in closer so I can get you in the photo.
Amazing!<eos> We wants deets.<eos> Tell us everything!<eos> I don't want to toot my own horn or anything, but it was super romantic.<eos> You follow.<eos> I'll cut him off in the alley.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> You want to get married?<eos> Yep.<eos> Jake, can I talk to you about my wedding for a second?
You follow.<eos> I'll cut him off in the alley.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> You want to get married?<eos> Yep.<eos> Jake, can I talk to you about my wedding for a second?<eos> Need help choosing a dress?<eos> Big puffy bow in the back, can't go wrong.<eos> No to all of that.<eos> Look, Adrian is about to ask you to be his best man.
I'm sure there's a perfectly stable explanation for this.<eos> Someone's trying to kill me!<eos> Mind closed, Jake!<eos> Mind closed.<eos> Look, I know you're upset because Pimento seems a little amped up...<eos> We were going 90 with the headlights off!<eos> But please just give him a chance to explain before getting all angry and yelling, "Hey, man!"<eos> Hey, man!<eos> What the hell were you doing?<eos> Great, Sarge, can I just talk to you outside for one moment?
BRB. BRB. BRB.<eos> Sarge, he's a good cop.<eos> IF you ask him in a supportive, non-confrontational manner, he'll give you a calm, logical answer.<eos> Fine.<eos> Why do you want to know?<eos> Who are you working for?<eos> I will cut you, little man.<eos> Cool.<eos> Hey, uh, Adrian?<eos> Can I borrow you for one sec?
A gun and a picture of Pimento.<eos> What do you have to say now?<eos> I guess someone's trying to kill him.<eos> That's right!<eos> In your face!<eos> Someone's trying to kill him! Whoo!<eos> I mean, a man's life is in danger.<eos> Probably shouldn't be so pumped.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> I'm also sorry that someone's trying to kill you, but I can really only take ownership for the first part.
They seemed really happy.<eos> - They really did. - Yeah.<eos> Hey, man. How'd it go last night?<eos> Sarge cool with Adrian now?<eos> Oh, so you haven't seen him, huh?<eos> I figured he just passed out at your place or something.<eos> Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, man. Let's go for a walk.<eos> He wanted me to tell you that he loves you.
- I'd rather not.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> A secret fbi meet up? I love this!<eos> Look at all those idiots.<eos> They have no idea what's about to go down.<eos> - You mean that woman and her baby? - Yep.<eos> Idiots.<eos> - Oh, here comes bob.<eos> Please behave. Hello, bob.<eos> Good to see you. - And you.
Please.<eos> Tell me everything about them.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> That would be nice.<eos> - Ahh! Not a toucher.<eos> Totally get it.<eos> I'll keep my hands to myself.<eos> - What's going on, sarge? You find that leak yet?<eos> - Yes. I'm hiding behind a coffeemaker, spying on everyone In this office, because I found the leak.<eos> - Aww, terry. Sarcasm is not a good look on you.
- Yeah, because that wasn't the real file.<eos> [radio static] - I just need to put my return address on it.<eos> And...<eos> There you go.<eos> - Oh, thank you. [radio static]<eos> - We have to call holt.<eos> [phone line trilling] Come on, captain.<eos> Pick up. Pick up.<eos> [phone chiming] - Don't answer that, raymond.<eos> And now I'm going to have to kill you.
Okay.<eos> My name is Isabel Cortez, I'm in for murder, 'cause some perv on the subway tried to touch me and I was like,<eos> "Did someone order a tracheotomy?"<eos> Okay, I think that's a little too technical.<eos> We need to work on your tough talk.<eos> So, what are you in for, Cortez?<eos> None of your damn business.<eos> Nice.<eos> Keep going with that.<eos> I'm gonna split you like a sundae with Grandpa... bitch.
Senior Year."<eos> All right.<eos> Point is, it's not a high school musical.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - I got it.<eos> Look, Figgis is seriously dangerous, all right?<eos> She's killed more people in prison than she did on the outside.<eos> I know, and if I back down now she'll never respect me and we'll get nowhere with her.<eos> Trust me, I've got this.<eos> Okay, I can see that logic, but in the interest of keeping you as un-shanked as possible, I think maybe we need a signal in case things go south.
I can't believe this.<eos> You wouldn't tell Rosa to stand down.<eos> Well, yeah, because she's Rosa.<eos> I mean, one time, I saw her eat a whole apple using a knife, just like in the movies.<eos> Get over the apple thing.<eos> That was three years ago.<eos> I know, it was just so cool.<eos> Look, I'm your handler, all right?<eos> You have to just trust me on this.<eos> My job is to keep you safe.
It's just too much for me.<eos> Oh, my God. Amy, go to him.<eos> - I screwed up.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> I get it.<eos> Being a cop and dating a cop...<eos> It's harder than I thought it would be.<eos> I worry about you too.<eos> Oh, my God. Jake, go to her.<eos> Look, I was just trying to keep you safe, but I wasn't letting you do your job.
I worry about you too.<eos> Oh, my God. Jake, go to her.<eos> Look, I was just trying to keep you safe, but I wasn't letting you do your job.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why aren't you going to each other?<eos> I think I have to take myself off of this assignment.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> You got this.<eos> Hopefully, I haven't already blown your cover by dragging you into my office so many times.
A taxi will cost me a fortune.<eos> Someone will give you a ride.<eos> All right.<eos> What if I get molested?<eos> I'll give you another five euros.<eos> Oh, here's our Donatella.<eos> - Her name's Antonella, not Donatella.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Everyone loves your work.<eos> Let me introduce you.
YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE!<eos> I'M DOWNSTAIRS.<eos> Mom, it's Alice.<eos> Tell her I'm not here.<eos> No, tell her I'm ill.<eos> No, tell her I'm on a school trip and they've taken our phones off us.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Hi, Anto. - Hi.<eos> Sorry to bother you, but is Sam home?
Mom, it's Alice.<eos> Tell her I'm not here.<eos> No, tell her I'm ill.<eos> No, tell her I'm on a school trip and they've taken our phones off us.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Hi, Anto. - Hi.<eos> Sorry to bother you, but is Sam home?<eos> - He went out this morning. - I haven't seen him since.<eos> But don't worry. I'll tell him to call you when he gets back.
Bye.<eos> - Sam, what's going on?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> If you want to leave her, you have to tell her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go and entertain Mr Charming.<eos> Fine.<eos> I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WON'T SEE ME.<eos> I WON'T CONTACT YOU AGAIN.
You can go to hell.<eos> Shit. It's your turn.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I said it's your turn.<eos> It's my turn to do what?<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Get up!<eos> Are you checking yourself out?<eos> No, no, I was...<eos> What's wrong with you?
- You don't want to keep it?<eos> - I don't know yet.<eos> You, have a baby?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Hello.<eos> I'm Mr Covelli.<eos> - May I speak to Dr Lusuardi?<eos> - Sweetie.<eos> Your father is simply trying to tell you that having a child at your age will change your whole life. And you have plans.
- Come on, Dad.<eos> - What?<eos> - Can you cover up?<eos> - Do I embarrass you?<eos> - Come on, Dad!<eos> I'll put it away.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I made the same mistake.<eos> But I think it's partly our fault.<eos> For years we've told you that you ruined our lives, so you decided to ruin your own.
You haven't lost them.<eos> You have yet to find them.<eos> But you have loads of time and you're doing your best.<eos> That's why I gave you seven.<eos> Let me go see if Tombolotta's asleep.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - You got an average of seven!<eos> - Have you fainted?<eos> - You already told me that.<eos> When? I tried to wake you up, but couldn't. So I came here myself.
Did he take a shit?<eos> Is he breathing?<eos> After a while, we couldn't even look at each other.<eos> Because when you're my age and an adult, this kind of thing can work.<eos> But at your age, relationships last five minutes and with a child... three.<eos> Well, I'm not like you.<eos> Play.<eos> Kill the bastard.<eos> How hard is it to put it in the laundry basket?<eos> Hey! I'm talking to you. Hey!
I had a golden ear, a silver tongue, and a pair of brass balls.<eos> But the problem became my nose and everything I put up it.<eos> Add to that a couple of disastrous artists' signings and by 1972 the label was bleeding. Fucking hemorrhaging money.<eos> But fuck it, that's what partners are for.<eos> Zak Yankovich, my right-hand man and head of payola.<eos> I mean, promotions.<eos> - Mitch, my man.<eos> - Zakovich.<eos> - How are you, buddy? - Hey.<eos> - Good to see you. - You, too.
You're a fucking imbecile, that's what.<eos> Come on, Richie, it's after 1:00 A.M.<eos> Led Zeppelin, Robert Plant, how'd he know?<eos> - Know what?<eos> - The rate. How the fuck did Plant know I tried to cut it?<eos> Oh, shit. The fuck do I know?<eos> Must have been their lawyer.<eos> You said you had pull with the guy.<eos> 'Cause the fucker told me he was good with the final round of changes.<eos> He told you?
What are you up to?<eos> You're not doing anything on your end to help.<eos> Yo, yo, yo, yo, please buy my CD.<eos> He got into my system and he wants me to put the CD on one of the computers at work.<eos> Well, I guess I should pay up, Ahmed, before I get lynched over here.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're excited.<eos> Yeah, I'm excited.<eos> We get to go to China.<eos> Elliot, before you get started, I'm asking you to help me and not look where you don't need to.
Nothing but baggage, sorry to say.<eos> No, no, that was Ty...<eos> We're gonna have to get your peepers checked as soon as we get home.<eos> In the meantime, go do what you got to do.<eos> We shove off in five.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, no problem, E-meister.<eos> Give me four!<eos> Or not.<eos> Can I help you?
Sometimes they protect you.<eos> And sometimes they help you get away with murder.<eos> When the truth is painful, son... and it often is... a lie is the only remedy.<eos> 'Cause too much truth, too much honesty, that'll kill ya.<eos> This whole place is a lie.<eos> Nothing here is true.<eos> Listen, I know your gut's saying not to trust me.<eos> But look around.<eos> Everything you see, it's all here for you.<eos> To help you.
You've taken over.<eos> What's that, kiddo?<eos> That's what this is.<eos> This road trip.<eos> This family vacation.<eos> I'm buried here.<eos> Well, I'll let you in on a little secret.<eos> This was never gonna be permanent.<eos> We did always have a destination.<eos> After the beating you took, at least they got you to a doctor.
I wanted to make sure you're all right is all.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> Get rid of him.<eos> Anyway, I'm Agent Ross Thomas, CY-5.<eos> Mobley, you're getting the transfers.<eos> Anything?<eos> Angela.<eos> He hails from San Diego, relationship is complicated.<eos> So what's it like?<eos> Knowing that every room you walk into, at least one person is quietly trying to muster the courage to ask you out.
Your mom, Darlene, work, you.<eos> Come on, kiddo.<eos> World isn't gonna get rid of me that easily.<eos> I'm gonna be okay.<eos> I'm never gonna leave you.<eos> Promise.<eos> Enough of this gloom and doom.<eos> Why dwell on the past when we can take a peek into the future?<eos> The site of my new gig.<eos> That's where I'm taking you.
Disloyalty is a fragmentation bomb.<eos> It causes collateral damage, long after its explosion.<eos> Disloyalty is a cancer.<eos> You never know if you'll survive.<eos> You never know how far it's spread.<eos> I've known cases of disloyalty during the course of my career.<eos> Serious cases, memorable ones.<eos> But this case... will become a legend.<eos> CEYLANPINAR TURKEY Show me the note.<eos> Hafiz Muhammad Hashmi did send you.
And you never stopped.<eos> Julia stopped.<eos> I mean, maybe in college, but now I totally--<eos> Yes, you see, she stopped.<eos> But you never did.<eos> Only the best and the purest can face The Beast, and that is you.<eos> Right, okay, so here's the thing,<eos> I can't really touch the knife that can kill The Beast.<eos> Yes, you need my strength.<eos> I will infuse you with... my essence.
Yeah, Josh and Victoria bailed.<eos> On one hand, fuck 'em, on the other hand, you can't really blame 'em.<eos> So I was writing this down because I didn't know much, but I knew that I was the hero of this story.<eos> It all just felt like the exact moment that my entire life had been building up to, all of the reading, and dreaming, and loneliness, and magic.<eos> All of it.<eos> And then... well, and then this story actually happened.<eos> And I started to realize the truth.<eos> It's so insignificant-- us being together and falling apart, I mean, it just doesn't matter.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I know you don't want to hear it, but I love you.
Looks like little Ms. Cruz was stepping out on her husband.<eos> Where, uh, where's Jack Cruz?<eos> Anybody know?<eos> Haven't been able to reach him.<eos> Well, what a shock.<eos> Okay.<eos> So we're thinking that, uh, Mr. Cruz found out Mrs. Cruz was having an affair, came here and tried to kill her?<eos> Or something went down with the person that she was meeting.<eos> Well, whatever the case may be, I think we can all agree that Launa Cruz is having a far worse Valentine's Day than any of us.<eos> Oh, my Daisy, what have they done to you?

What's going on?<eos> You remember my wife Nalani?<eos> Yes, of course, it is lovely to see you again, Nalani.<eos> Uh, have a lovely evening.<eos> Oof, poor Duke.<eos> Poor Duke?<eos> Poor Mrs. Lukela.<eos> What about poor me?<eos> You know, I still have no idea how things went south so fast.<eos> Well, I-I-I can help you with this one, I think.
Um, not well.<eos> She left.<eos> She was very upset.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> Sad story.<eos> Listen, uh, I came here to hear about the black eye.<eos> I got it.<eos> She hit you with the ring.<eos> Okay, all right. How about this?<eos> You were rooting around in the closet looking for something... baseball falls off a shelf, hits you right in the eye.
♪ Everglow ♪<eos> ♪ So if you love someone ♪<eos> ♪ You should let them know ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, the light that you left me ♪<eos> ♪ Will everglow. ♪<eos> Are you there?<eos> I need to apologize for my behavior.<eos> I know we never... talked about what this meant or where it was going.<eos> I didn't expect to feel the way I do.<eos> I like you, Chin, I... I really like you.
Except I'm in San Francisco right now.<eos> In case you're wondering, it's work stuff.<eos> Okay. All good.<eos> I really ruined both our Valentine's.<eos> You know what?<eos> You really did.<eos> You have no idea how much.<eos> Well, maybe when I... get back to the Island in a couple days, you'll let me make it up to you.<eos> Maybe I will.<eos> I'll call you.
Ever since this bailout fiasco yesterday, these kits are flying off the shelves.<eos> The, uh, end of civilization is near, so this is gonna have to wait.<eos> I can settle the lawsuit.<eos> Stay out of that.<eos> The lawyers are handling it.<eos> E Corp will settle. But there's a contingency with the independent inspections.<eos> If we drop it...<eos> I'm not discussing this with you.<eos> If you drop the independent inspections, they will settle.<eos> Did... did your boss put you up to this?
I need your help.<eos> I've been lost these past few weeks.<eos> Since the whole Ray thing.<eos> I need to finish what I started. With Evil Corp.<eos> But I don't know what to do.<eos> Why did you first start listening to me?<eos> When I sent you that note on the server at Evil Corp, something inside you told you to listen.<eos> And you did.<eos> Followed me off the subway, came to fsociety, and then you... not me... led us to hack Evil Corp.<eos> I didn't force you to do any of it.
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> - Come with me.<eos> - Searching for werewolves?<eos> Helping someone else find their path will help you with yours.
Straight into the wind.<eos> Through a juniper field into a valley of pines.<eos> Come on.<eos> What is it?<eos> The Wicked Witch.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Would you prefer I send you chocolates next time?<eos> If you're looking for a thank you, maybe you should write your name on the card next time.<eos> I'm afraid I didn't come to woo you, Zelena.<eos> I came to warn you.
If she's dead, she can't just leave the Underworld to give Dorothy true love's kiss.<eos> Maybe she doesn't have to.<eos> The other day, the Blind Witch bottled David's breath.<eos> What? Why would she do that?<eos> Yeah, well, she roasted children in her previous life.<eos> Do we even want the answer to that?<eos> The point is maybe we can do the same thing with the kiss from Aunt Em.<eos> Ruby could use the slippers to deliver it Dorothy in Oz.<eos> Snow!<eos> We've been looking everywhere for you.
I don't think the soup agreed with her.<eos> You did this.<eos> Mm. Guilty.<eos> A little water from the River of Souls gives the soup a little something... special.<eos> Why would you hurt her?<eos> She was just a sweet old lady.<eos> Mm. Isn't it obvious?<eos> Because you're trying to help her.<eos> And Dorothy, who happens to be Zelena's sworn enemy.<eos> Did she put you up to this?
Because you tried to erase the names.<eos> The rule down here is simple... a life for a life.<eos> So, I traded mine for yours.<eos> If one of us gets to go home and see our son, it should be you.<eos> How did you know to do this?<eos> Simple, love.<eos> Hades overlooked one thing during my escape... he enchanted my hand to carve these markers in the first place.<eos> I can't erase the names, but I can change them.<eos> Come on.<eos> Our boy waits for you.
But not enough, I know.<eos> Just giving you a decayed version of what your sister had...<eos> You deserve more.<eos> You deserve the real thing.<eos> And once my heart is beating again and I can leave this place for good, that's where I want to take you.<eos> You want to come with me to Storybrooke?<eos> If you'd have me.<eos> But what about all your plans?<eos> I don't care about that anymore.<eos> Not if I can have you.
What do you want?<eos> What? Can't a sister show she cares?<eos> I thought I'd find you still sulking over your favorite pair of shoes.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Well, I was...<eos> You know where I was, don't you?<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> You've been spying on me.<eos> How?<eos> Next time, tell your boyfriend to pick you up in something with a little less chrome.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> You ready?<eos> Regina said the rendezvous point with Robin is a half day's walk into the woods.<eos> You sure you have all the supplies from her list?<eos> Bottled water, new blanket, and a lot of baby wipes.<eos> Father of the year.<eos> Just do me a favor.<eos> When we get back, don't tell Snow I forgot our anniversary.<eos> Well, between all of the curses and the time jumps, who could blame you?
Why wouldn't your mother have told us?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to ask her.<eos> So... you just happened to be in the neighborhood, taking a little stroll in Hell and decided to stop by?<eos> No. I've, um, been in a kind of prison, Hades' version of one, anyway.<eos> And when I heard you were here, I knew I had to come.<eos> Regina sent you, didn't she?<eos> To try and talk me out of it.<eos> You think Regina would ever forget what I did to her father?<eos> No. And as for stopping you, I'm the last person to do that, not when it was my doing that put you in this position in the first place.
And what's that supposed to mean?<eos> I'm sure your feelings for Hades are real.<eos> But isn't it obvious?<eos> You're still trying to fill the hole in your heart I created when I abandoned you.<eos> I'm not interested in talking about this.<eos> I'm over it.<eos> I have been for years.<eos> No, you aren't.<eos> What I did left a wound that's been festering for... decades.<eos> You want to know if I regret my decision, if after all these years, I'm sorry I gave you away.
Look, please...<eos> I know Izzie Hillcroft a little from, you know, back in the day.<eos> _<eos> She's having an art opening tomorrow.<eos> I'll go, assure her the hotel is safe, that this is all behind us, and, you know, charm her a little.<eos> You really think you can charm a woman about to get married?<eos> It worked with you.<eos> True, for the record.<eos> You recall their first meeting, the night she got engaged.<eos> So, listen, I'd love the night she to take you out.
Dad, are you even listening to me?<eos> Jane, I got this, I promise.<eos> Just go.<eos> And you actually left?<eos> I swear, I'm in the car driving.<eos> I mean, I did make him swear not to text, or tweet.<eos> - Oh, are you there?<eos> - A-almost.<eos> Okay, good luck.<eos> Remember, you are an amazing performer, and they would be lucky to have you, so don't take no for an answer.
Now I'm stuck playing bodyguard for her majesty, Delle Shitza.<eos> Well, working for the baddest bitch in the Quad's got to have its moments.<eos> It's just dumb parties and meetings.<eos> This missing kids thing is the most action I've seen in months.<eos> The kids are missing?<eos> Olan's not even here?<eos> Hey, Jake...<eos> Screw this.<eos> I'll find him myself.<eos> I don't think your heart is why the RAC turned you down, Hokkhead.
If we can get to the control room.<eos> Hey, Johnny, I need you to crack open Lucy and tell that little shit he's grounded.<eos> We'll get the kids back to the cryopods, buy us some time.<eos> Be careful in there.<eos> Don't underestimate Olan.<eos> I said he's smart.<eos> Not smarter than me.<eos> He probably is smarter.<eos> Empirically speaking.<eos> Well, no one asked you, Xosia.
Forget to think of her.<eos> O, teach me how I should forget to think!<eos> By giving liberty unto thine eyes.<eos> Examine other beauties.<eos> - (piano plays) - Romeo: I dreamed a dream last night.<eos> Cortney: I'm a mom, Brandon.<eos> I'm sorry, but that's the way it is and if you can't handle that, then...<eos> I... I never said I couldn't handle it.<eos> Well, you might as well have the way you... responded to that woman on the beach yesterday.<eos> "I'm not his father." You just... you blurted it out like she was... accusing you of something!
So which is it?<eos> Are you a lush or a liar?<eos> He's a moron.<eos> I'm gonna grab us a refill, Mur.<eos> You want a six pack, Mickey Mantle?<eos> - I'm probably being a little paranoid, but it kind of seems like Bill hates my living guts.<eos> Hoo-hoo! He sure does!<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Mom says I'm literally a human ray of sunshine.<eos> Your mom's a nice lady, but she's done some real damage to you.
It was now or never.<eos> Barry would have to dig down deep inside himself and do the impossible.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> That's about right.<eos> It's okay. I got this.<eos> Whoa! Way colder than I thought.<eos> As Barry desperately flailed in that murky golf pond, my dad realized the kid really needed a life preserver.<eos> Starting to see why you call him moron so much.<eos> Yeah, well, the thing is he's the sweetest moron you'd ever want to meet.<eos> And he loves your daughter... So much that he'd do anything to impress you.
- Why not?<eos> - Why?<eos> Because if she was, then that means I'm --<eos> Means you're what?<eos> Complicit?<eos> Weak? Evil?<eos> For starters, yeah.<eos> Do you honestly think you ever had a choice in the matter?<eos> She's the sister of God.<eos> And for some reason, she picked you, and that sucks, but if you think I'm gonna blame you or judge you...
But if he was in on it, then why kill him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But we could ask his wife.<eos> Hey, Captain, I'd like to, uh, volunteer to take Sonia back to the prison.<eos> No.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Yeah, I know, but it's the right thing to do.<eos> All right.<eos> You interview Kirby's wife.<eos> And I expect you back first thing in the morning, ready to work.
Well, you know what?<eos> I'll bring some cronuts by in the morning.<eos> That usually cheers him up.<eos> Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I hope so.<eos> - This'll make it better.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I have to say, Katherine, it is so good to have you home.
Come on, babe.<eos> Don't even pretend like you didn't know it was gonna go down this way.<eos> Turn away if you don't want to see it.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I can't let you do that.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> He's got to die, and we got to go.<eos> No.<eos> We leave him here alive.<eos> He was your fiancé, and he threw you away.

I'm gonna have to fire my mother.<eos> - Rogelio. - You think I want to do this?<eos> But there's no other option.<eos> Which brings us here.<eos> - Now.<eos> - I told them<eos> - you don't pop in peach.<eos> - It's actually more of a coral, and I do look good in it.<eos> Mom, this is not working.<eos> I thought it was a good idea to have you here, but you're just too... present.
No, but we should.<eos> The security grid lists cameras in the area, but if they're there, they're offline.<eos> It's very convenient.<eos> Why would you disable cameras if you're just gonna ditch a getaway car?<eos> You wouldn't... unless you were planning on coming back.<eos> For the van or something else?<eos> Hey, guys, we're gonna send you some BIC codes from these containers.<eos> Find out who owns them and where they're going.<eos> You got it.<eos> Hey, so, I thought Hetty banned you from wearing a kilt to work.
Yeah... it's a burden you must live with. Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> See? Anna gets it.<eos> Don't encourage him.<eos> Or look into his kind and soulful blue eyes.<eos> Out of respect for Kensi, I will keep my distance from the Deeks-ness.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Guys, it worked.<eos> We just received a secure video message for Anna.<eos> Anna, if you are seeing this, then you did what was asked of you.
I heard what happened to your sister.<eos> I am terribly sorry for your loss.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> What happened to drying out?<eos> If drinking's an issue, you really have to take it seriously.<eos> I can handle this myself.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> We're good.<eos> We're back, okay?<eos> She tried to dump you as her partner.
Dispatch, we're gonna need that forced entry.<eos> - Hey, bud, what's your name?<eos> - Tino.<eos> Tino, I need you to do me a favor.<eos> I need you to leave this window open, and I need you to sit by your brother, okay?<eos> - Where was he shot?<eos> - In his leg.<eos> The hole's really big.<eos> It's probably a shotgun wound.<eos> Okay, Tino, we're gonna help you until we can come inside.
You're gonna land one punch... one.<eos> Then you're gonna stay the hell out of Antonio's way, 'cause that's how you're gonna get to the second round and make your 400 bucks.<eos> Come on, keep the punches low.<eos> People are watching.<eos> Taking a ride.<eos> Oh, this place is bleak.<eos> I'm only here for the doughnuts.<eos> Nice try.<eos> You're here 'cause this woman needs to be heard, and nobody's doing it.<eos> And you're the kind of guy who can't let someone down in need, and I love you for that.
I just did.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> See ya.<eos> You know what, guys?<eos> No offense.<eos> I'm really not in the mood for a good, old-fashioned 51 "Kumbaya," so...<eos> Chili, maybe there's something we can do.<eos> Really, Brett?<eos> What are you gonna do about it?<eos> Come on, kid, let us help you out.
- Maggie? - He dressed?<eos> He's dead.<eos> So Dr. Downey is a very strange guy.<eos> Now what?<eos> He got Goodwin to assign me to him on some kind of ongoing basis.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, it's crazy, right?<eos> Dr. Downey asked you to assist him?<eos> - You? - Yeah.<eos> The premier cardiac surgeon in the country asks you to assist him and you pass?
You came to the right place, 'cause Dr. Love is in the house.<eos> Now, when it comes to girls, just have to remember the three C's... Confidence, coolness, and always be closing!<eos> Closing what?<eos> Okay, that seems like a natural stopping point.<eos> Dave, honey, just be yourself.<eos> Yes, listen to your mother.<eos> She knows.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Dad's teaching me how to ask out a girl.<eos> Did he tell you about the three C's...
This is Dave.<eos> Is Emma home?<eos> Hi.<eos> Emma!<eos> You guys are the Parks, right?<eos> Our dad hates your dad.<eos> [Laughs]<eos> Well, our dad hates your dad.<eos> You're tall.<eos> Emma, I know your dad doesn't want us to go to the dance together, but I needed to hear it from you.
"Hey, Grandpa, no one cares what you think."<eos> Are you sure that that's not from Haley?<eos> Here's another one.<eos> The same jerk!<eos> "It's weird you don't like goat cheese when you've got a goat face."<eos> - Well, that makes no sense. - Mnh-mnh.<eos> What kind of goat eats its own cheese?<eos> Here I am, trying to make America laugh and think, and this hockey puck's coming at me with tired insults.<eos> Okay, I-it's called a troll, Jay.<eos> But you can't let him or anything else keep you from directing all of your opinions into that computer.
I got to go.<eos> See you black home.<eos> Pretty sure I know why I said that.<eos> This is the most pain I've ever been in in my life.<eos> And a horse once kicked me into an electric fence.<eos> Well, C-Cam, yeah, you broke your arm.<eos> You got to go to the hospital.<eos> No. Not yet.<eos> I'll go in, draw myself a bath, pretend to fall and break my arm.<eos> In the meantime, go get those painkillers that they gave you when you twisted your ankle.
You've got to be kidding me.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to punch LadyKiller in his fat face.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can we start over?<eos> I was on "Photo."<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Any time.<eos> You're pathetic.<eos> I crushed you in the closet game, and I'm crushing it on the Internet.

- Hold this!<eos> - Hold this.<eos> That went on for a good 20 seconds.<eos> Why do we keep doing this? !<eos> Who knows?<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> You two need each other.<eos> It's what drives you.<eos> The kid is right.<eos> Beating you is half the reason I get out of bed.
Why didn't I close that door so you didn't get stuck like Manny's gerbil in the glue trap?<eos> But you said he ran away.<eos> Yes, most of him did.<eos> Take off your slippers.<eos> Oh, yeah, good idea. Don't want anything bad to happen to them.<eos> Okay. Wait!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> ! They're Florentine leather!<eos> Ay, Manny, that's what we just told you.
Yes, you are!<eos> Ooh. You know what, Dad?<eos> You have been really bossy tonight.<eos> With me, with that waitress.<eos> I-I bet that's why you and Gloria are having problems.<eos> Yeah. You miss bossing people around at work, so now you're doing it at home.<eos> If I admitted there was some truth in that, could you just give in?<eos> You've been grinding around like Lola Falana.<eos> I don't know why this is so important to you.<eos> Can you just let me help you? !
Ohh, pizza day.<eos> That's our personal trainer.<eos> He hates it when we eat carbs.<eos> We had a short window.<eos> We needed to impress them fast.<eos> So, we bribed Lily with all the soda she could drink and threw a party.<eos> It was going great until someone set off the alarm because he just had to smoke his dorky pipe.<eos> Dorky?<eos> Yeah, because Hugh Hefner doesn't get girls.<eos> I love you, too, Mommy.
- Hi.<eos> Can I have you help me over here for just a second?<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Ohh.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> He was clearly reaching out.<eos> He was admiring our garden.<eos> Nobody admires our garden.<eos> It's a dead cactus with a grocery bag stuck to it.<eos> What is going on with you?
!<eos> - Damn it!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You want to come back to work?<eos> I miss it, okay?<eos> You know how it is when you have closets in your blood.<eos> I'm going crazy in retirement.<eos> Why are you smiling at me like that?<eos> Because we're so similar.<eos> Do you know how many times I've wanted to call you to ask for your help or advice, but I was afraid I would look weak?
Let me feel that power.<eos> Come on.<eos> Make that leather sing!<eos> All right.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get on your bike.<eos> Back up.<eos> Get on your bike.<eos> Come on.<eos> They can't hit you if they can't reach you.
Thank...<eos> You followed me into a car wash!<eos> That is so not...<eos> Okay, I have a...<eos> What I want to say to you...<eos> I have a lot of things I want to say to you.<eos> I have a restraining order against you.<eos> I'm not dangerous, and you don't need to be afraid of me.<eos> Clearly.<eos> Okay, well, I guess, um... nice seeing you.
Yeah, you are.<eos> Look, I just want you to know, when you drop me off, that's it...<eos> I'm... not bothering you ever again.<eos> Good.<eos> I just want to say one thing...<eos> Please stop talking.<eos> Oh! Geez!<eos> Get out.<eos> I'm calling you a car... out!<eos> Sam, you were right to take a restraining order against me because, ever since I saw you again, I can't stop thinking about you.
Because of the restraining order?<eos> Look, we've grown up a lot. We've made mistakes and we've learned from them.<eos> Jess, nobody takes out a restraining order unless they think that they're in danger.<eos> Winston's right.<eos> What?<eos> You're dangerous.<eos> I mean, you're dangerous to me.<eos> You want to know why I got the restraining order?<eos> 'Cause I couldn't stop thinking about you either.<eos> I didn't trust myself not to call you and start this whole thing up again.
You murdered my father, you son of a bitch.<eos> Tell me why!<eos> Delivery.<eos> Yousee,thisis a chess game to him.<eos> He just sent us a very clear message that he is moves ahead.<eos> I'd like to, uh, introduce you to Inspector Abby Dunn.<eos> San Francisco PD is putting together a task force based on what we do.<eos> Hi. I like you, Chin, I...<eos> I really like you.<eos> I like you, too, Abby.
No. I'm one hour and 47 minutes late for work.<eos> I'm gonna be in trouble. Neil...<eos> Remember what we talked about.<eos> Sometimes schedules can change.<eos> Now, Commander McGarrett needs your help.<eos> No. No! I have to leave!<eos> I have to close P-2 at 9:00 p.m.<eos> Very important!<eos> How about this, Neil? What if we make a deal?<eos> What if you show me where Mark's house is, and I promise you I will get you to work before 9:00 p.m.
All right. Well, uh, give me a call when the place is ready to be cleaned.<eos> Or for any other, uh...<eos> needs you may have.<eos> Are you implying sexual needs, Gerard?<eos> Um, sure.<eos> I'll pass.<eos> I don't know how many ways I can say no.<eos> He-he just doesn't listen.<eos> I know, they're all the same, they're all the same.<eos> They lure you in with a prize, and then they hit you with the hard sell.
Where's the money now?<eos> I transferred it to an offshore account.<eos> All right. So whoever executed the crew is looking for that money.<eos> Was Mark a bad person?<eos> No. Sometimes people make bad decisions.<eos> It doesn't change the fact that Mark was your friend and that he cared about you.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What could the FBI possibly want with your mother?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Why do you think I'm calling you?
Guys, I have a visual on our target and four hostiles moving on your location from the east side.<eos> Gabriel knows we're here.<eos> All right, Kono, hold your position.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Lock yourself in the bathroom, lie down in the tub and stay there.<eos> No matter what happens out here, don't come out unless I tell you.<eos> Guys, we're gonna go floor by floor, split this building into thirds, shoot anything that moves.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Don't do it!<eos> Girl... I love you!
_<eos> _<eos> Who wants to go to Los Angeles?<eos> Hey, what's going on, man?<eos> Como estas, man, how you been?<eos> Good talk, Carlos.<eos> So where's the merchandise?<eos> I'm ready to do some shopping.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Here's the gun I told you about.
- Captain, come on.<eos> You're on a desk until further notice.<eos> _<eos> Welcome to Los Angeles.<eos> Have we arrived late?<eos> I was told we would load the trucks then call for police escort.<eos> You're all Asian.<eos> Chinese, actually!<eos> A ransom demand of 200 million US dollars was made for the return of the statues.<eos> If the FBI does not make quick progress I will send you to Los Angeles to facilitate the payment.
You're bogarting my witch.<eos> These spirits don't lie.<eos> A little too honest sometimes.<eos> I mean, I didn't ask them if they like my bangs, but they sure told me.<eos> It was a whole thing.<eos> You don't need to help me.<eos> I'll get over the Randy thing.<eos> I've been through worse things, like this right now.<eos> No.<eos> They're insisting that I help you.
Grab me a jar.<eos> That's where we store the pain... and lentils, once you're healed.<eos> Great.<eos> No guy, but now I have a middle-aged lesbian lover.<eos> All right, it's out.<eos> I thought I was gonna have to move to a bigger jar.<eos> You must've really liked this guy.<eos> He was okay.<eos> Well, he's crushed.<eos> He really liked you too.
I mean, we're rich, and we paid a lot of money and made it happen! Yay!<eos> No clapping!<eos> This is not a clapping matter.<eos> We can't be married.<eos> We don't know each other.<eos> I mean, you said last night, you didn't remember me.<eos> I didn't until we spent the whole night looking at our old yearbooks and started reminiscing.<eos> All the feelings came flooding back.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> How about the bad feelings from when you hated me for what I did to you?
Denied.<eos> We should be back on Lucy.<eos> Do it now. Now, now, now, now.<eos> Denied.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Johnny, wake up.<eos> Did we die and go to Leith?<eos> Oh. No, not another wall.<eos> I'm gonna do a waist-lock.<eos> Try to yank you down.
What?<eos> Yeah, $150 even.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> 'Cause that would be half of $300.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I just put it on my visa, so you can pay me back whenever.<eos> No rush... just whenever you go to the bank machine.<eos> 'Kay.<eos> Okay. Remember, in this scene, Cindy, you're Abby... a beautiful, calculating temptress who will stop at nothing to get what she wants.<eos> And, Troy, you're Gary... a handsome, naive Texas transplant who used to be married to Valene, but then Abby stole you, and now she's trying to make you, Gary, feel better about cutting your best friend, Kenny,
Do you?<eos> No.<eos> But I'm in charge of connecting everybody.<eos> Oh!<eos> Don't look at me!<eos> I'm hideous!<eos> Hey, Sue!<eos> Oh, what a nice surprise, honey.<eos> What are you doing home?<eos> I didn't have class till the afternoon, so I thought I'd stop by and say hi, and that I love you so much.
"No bathroom breaks!<eos> You'll eat when you get it right!"<eos> It may not be fun for them anymore.<eos> Or ever.<eos> But I'm the director.<eos> It's my job to bring "Knots Landing" to life.<eos> I mean, a writer wrote this.<eos> All I want to do is be faithful to the material and make sure it's executed to the promise of the script.<eos> Look, I'm just saying,<eos> Troy and Cindy volunteered to help you.
He's really old.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, Lexie...<eos> You're great and amazing, and I so, so, so, so, so want you to be my roommate.<eos> But, honestly, I can't afford it.<eos> I mean, if you want to find someone else who you can do stuff with, I totally get it.<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> You're my roommate.<eos> God, I feel like such an idiot for putting you in this position.
Don't worry about me.<eos> I'm used to not doing fun stuff.<eos> Years of practice.<eos> Ugh, but seriously, do you think you can find someone else to go to Taylor Swift with?<eos> I just can't afford V.I.P. tickets.<eos> So, they found a way to go to the concert that Sue could afford.<eos> I hope she does "Shake It Off."<eos> Wait.<eos> I think this is "Shake It Off."<eos> We love you, Taylor!
Whomever we hire, we will have to keep a very close eye on them.<eos> So I would like to tighten our oversight by having Lester install recording equipment in the conference room and all the exam rooms.<eos> Recording equipment?<eos> To record?<eos> Everything.<eos> Sessions with patients, conversations between staff members.<eos> Why?<eos> I can't imagine any new hire is going to stand being listened in on.<eos> And yet if we had tape recorders in this office two months ago, we wouldn't be staring down the barrel at criminal charges.<eos> Courier just delivered these for you.
And that's really all they can do. That is what I'm doing.<eos> So if that is not good enough...<eos> It isn't.<eos> It isn't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> Coffee, please.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Great minds think alike.<eos> I've actually been meaning to call you to thank you for-- for helping my dad with the baby while I was away.
It isn't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> Coffee, please.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Great minds think alike.<eos> I've actually been meaning to call you to thank you for-- for helping my dad with the baby while I was away.<eos> Oh, that. I remembered that Lisa liked to be held stomach-down when she was a baby, so I tried that.<eos> Well, you were a saint to do it.<eos> I've actually been meaning to call you too.
And you didn't have to sacrifice your life to save all of us from the Dark Ones.<eos> We're going.<eos> We'll be right here waiting for you.<eos> - Regina...<eos> - I know the drill.<eos> If you're not back by sunset...<eos> Everybody leaves, promise me.<eos> You'll be back.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> I love you, too, kid.
Well, then what are we still doing here?<eos> Boy Scout's got a point.<eos> We could take the baby to the cemetery now and then all walk through as soon as it opens.<eos> Not without Emma and Hook.<eos> And Henry's right.<eos> We can still help people.<eos> Robin, take the baby to the portal.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not leaving you in this place.<eos> He may be playing nice, but there's still plenty of people down here that have a grudge against you.
You're emotional.<eos> It's what keeps getting you in trouble.<eos> Can I give you a piece of advice?<eos> You got to learn how to protect yourself.<eos> Look, whatever we find here, that ain't gonna be the end all be all.<eos> Find your armor.<eos> Miss, I have your file.<eos> It's too thin.<eos> It's the same damn article.<eos> There's something on the boy who brought you in.
- That's right.<eos> No one's getting out before sunset when the portal closes, and then no one's getting out.<eos> Consider it payback, Regina!<eos> For tricking those children into burning me in my own oven.<eos> Oh, it's going to be a nice eternity after all.<eos> At least for us.<eos> The instructions couldn't be in English?<eos> "Only a heart filled with true love can pass."<eos> Seriously?<eos> You'd be surprised what they teach you in the Royal Navy.
What are you doing?<eos> I know we had a deal, but I can't...<eos> Yes, you can, and you will.<eos> You want your bail money that bad?<eos> Did you call security?<eos> - Ow! - Do you think a security guard is gonna show up and ask to see my license and give me my money?<eos> Damn it.<eos> All they're gonna see is two moron criminals on government property asking to get shot.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Look, I'm sure that your parents had reasons they gave you up, okay?
Something doesn't feel right.<eos> You two tail 'em.<eos> Listen, I was saying about the packages...<eos> Responsibility, Marion.<eos> I know you got yours to your family, I got mine<eos> Right now... - Yeah? ...you're a threat to mine.<eos> They're heading into the tunnel.<eos> We're two cars behind.<eos> All right, stay with 'em.<eos> You know, after this, that debt your brother left you with?
You know what, Klaus?<eos> If you want your precious hazelnuts, you sweep 'em up.<eos> Ew, we all heard that.<eos> Tense.<eos> Dad, why don't you just bring me to work with you?<eos> I'll set your computer up.<eos> You hanging around all my badass colleagues.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Dad, I won't embarrass you.<eos> You know what? Maybe it'll be good for you.
How do you know about Amanda?<eos> Oh, sorry. I'm Nat.<eos> I work for the National Security Agency.<eos> We saw what you were doing with your dad's computer, and we think you, Steve Smith, are N.S.A. material.<eos> Really?<eos> Hey, do you ever listen to my conversations with snot?<eos> We're the N.S.A.<eos> We got better things to do than listen to two confused kids flirt with each other.<eos> What a relief.<eos> Your dad ditched you to go to Applebee's with his friends.
What's happened?<eos> With your C.I.A. gone, it was easy for Cuba to invade United States.<eos> All hail Fidel!<eos> What a horrible nightmare.<eos> And why did I include that extra part where I actually saw mom stripping?<eos> One problem at a time.<eos> Dad.<eos> I did something terrible.<eos> I was snooping on you, and I heard what you said about me.<eos> And I got so mad I betrayed you to the N.S.A.
How's your worry-free day goin', Stan?<eos> Look, we all know what the results of the pregnancy test is going to be.<eos> Jeff smokes so much weed --<eos> How much weed does he smoke?<eos> That -- that there's no way he could get a girl pregnant?<eos> I mean, it's...<eos> it's not really a joke.<eos> But -- but I could think of one!<eos> Oh, you lost them, Stan.<eos> Look, if it's not this, your family will hit you with something else.
So about your dad, um...<eos> - Do you know why you're here?<eos> - He says it's police business.<eos> At NYPD, it's really 24/7.<eos> It is.<eos> Well, I got... I got some questions for you.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Jordan, has anybody ever talked to you about the difference between good touching and bad touching?<eos> Stranger danger?<eos> Yeah. Has anybody ever touched you in, um... well, a private place, and then told you not to talk about it?
Vehicles won't make it; too narrow.<eos> Giddyup?<eos> We go through the pass.<eos> It's steep.<eos> Stay close.<eos> Are we sure that this is the only way, on these beasts?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I'm on a horse, freezing my butt off because of you.<eos> And I appreciate that, but... But nothing!<eos> We pulled you out of that jail.
Do I need a reason?<eos> Y-Your father's napping.<eos> Let me get him.<eos> No, don't wake him, Mom.<eos> Oh, I can get him.<eos> Mom?<eos> What is it, dear?<eos> I can't stay on the phone.<eos> Why?<eos> Is someone waiting for you?
It's your last chance to see me.<eos> Well?<eos> OK, I'll do it.<eos> - OK.<eos> Be strong.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> We're together now.<eos> I'll find another house.<eos> And I'll ask for leave so I can stay with you.<eos> I'll call you.
You're different.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You'll improve here too.<eos> I think of you, listen to your music.<eos> You listen to music?<eos> That's haram!<eos> - Just your music.<eos> - No music.<eos> Listen to silence, you'll hear God.<eos> The sisters are waiting for you.
OK.<eos> Come.<eos> It's OK.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> An explosive belt?<eos> What's up?<eos> You want to say something?<eos> Good night, Mum.<eos> It's all organised.<eos> I'm taking you.
That's not what your neighbors said.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I thought she was somebody else.<eos> I don't know who this woman is.<eos> Oh, so you're telling me you, uh, you didn't know she was a Russian spy?<eos> What?<eos> No. What?<eos> Okay. I think I see what's going on here.<eos> Anna's an very attractive woman.<eos> You were taken with her, she seduced you and convinced you to download classified information.
You might be able to help with that.<eos> How so?<eos> Your name came up in connection with one of the operatives.<eos> The CIA's been desperate trying to reach her, but they've had no luck.<eos> I think everyone's hoping you might have a direct line.<eos> All right, Brenner. I... I don't know where Doris is, okay?<eos> I'm not talking about your mother, Commander.<eos> I'm talking about Lt. Catherine Rollins.<eos> What?<eos> Apparently, she's called you a few times from a sat phone.
Pinky! Wake up!<eos> Oh, no, uh, Detective Griffin, man.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I didn't do nothing.<eos> Pinky, you look awful.<eos> I know, uh, I do, Detective.<eos> I know I do.<eos> Hey, man, come on out of there.<eos> Am I under arrest?<eos> No. You were wearing that jersey the last time I arrested you.
How long have you two been working together, now?<eos> Uh, going on six years.<eos> Wow. How are you dealing with all that?<eos> Well, I try not to judge.<eos> Well, then, you must be very open-minded.<eos> What changed your mind?<eos> You know what I am, and you accept me for what I am.<eos> I was too quick to overlook that.<eos> Then I just got mad at myself, 'cause I knew I blew an opportunity.<eos> Then when I saw you in the frozen food section, I just figured, you know, well,
I did not.<eos> Doesn't mean I won't, but we're just getting reacquainted.<eos> I'm in no hurry.<eos> No, I spoke with him just the other day. Yeah.<eos> The Captain contacted Adalind, didn't tell me anything about it.<eos> Okay, what don't I know that I should know?<eos> Said that Diana is with the Resistance.<eos> I thought she was with the Royals.<eos> So did I.<eos> If the Captain is working with Black Claw, they're gonna use Adalind to get to you.
Then after she died, was she buried or cremated?<eos> Uh... Neither.<eos> She was held in the morgue, Patrick was called to identify her body, but he never showed up.<eos> I guess she's still there?<eos> All right, I'll check it out.<eos> We're recording.<eos> This is a message for my child.<eos> If you can hear me, sweetheart, please listen carefully.<eos> There's something I need to tell you.<eos> I've been a bad mother, and I did a terrible thing to let this happen to you.
I'm really glad it wasn't a baby girl.<eos> [Laughs]<eos> I'm really glad.<eos> Is that wrong?<eos> No.<eos> No. It's not.<eos> Ok.<eos> You will always be my original baby girl.<eos> Penelope Garcia,<eos> I love you so much.
- Okay, maybe drop the Southern accent.<eos> What, you got mozzarell in your ears?<eos> You're, uh, get out of your own way, lady, huh?<eos> Uh, tr-try, Law Order... uh, Hargitay.<eos> I've got a past and it affects my job.<eos> And my relationships...<eos> I can't really do a Mariska.<eos> What is happening here?<eos> Cece, I know the audition is scary for you.<eos> I would not be doing my job as the man who loves you if I let you walk away from this.
Oh yeah, that's good too.<eos> Just stay in the moment and have fun tonight.<eos> Thank you, Bonnie.<eos> You're a good friend.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Look at all those sad homeless people.<eos> Hang in there!<eos> We're going to a gala for you!<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Sorry, I-I hope I didn't keep you waiting.
God's gonna help you.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> So, anyway, seeing as we used to be such good friends,<eos> I was hoping we could start over.<eos> Oh, Jill, stop embarrassing yourself.<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> Wow, these people are cold.<eos> This is like the party scene in Frozen.<eos> I saw that movie before it came out.<eos> I'm the only one here who likes you.
Well, we cleared it out.<eos> I had you moved in here as soon as I found out that you arrived.<eos> You'll have more privacy.<eos> We got some food coming in from across the street.<eos> Where's the minibar, Ed?<eos> That's very funny.<eos> So, you have cramps and nausea.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Is this real, or is it just, like, bad Sushi or something?<eos> Maybe you should go home.<eos> Oh, so you can tell your lawyer that I left you here all alone?
Oh. Well, I'll just have to set him straight.<eos> Roseline is doing much better than expected.<eos> She's got a great spirit.<eos> Yeah, and she seems to like you, too.<eos> What about you?<eos> Do I like you?<eos> Do you like Schubert?<eos> I have tickets to the philharmonic this Saturday.<eos> Roseline, ready for our post-op?<eos> Dr. Campbell beat you to it.
Leslie's gonna stay with you for a little... don't want her with me!<eos> I'll just sit here quietly...<eos> No! Go away!<eos> You're not in my family!<eos> I don't want you in my family!<eos> Don't you think I care about your dad, too?<eos> That I love him, too?<eos> I'm sorry that upsets you so much.<eos> Luke, I know a lot of grown-ups are talking to you, and that can get confusing.<eos> I just want you to know that everybody's trying to help you, son.
Maybe losing the last one is the best thing that could have happened to you both.<eos> Look at you.<eos> When is the last time you held her hand like that?<eos> You love her.<eos> Maybe you forgot that.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.<eos> But it's too late.<eos> I lost her.<eos> I love you, too.
But I have learned over time that if I can't trust my family, I certainly can't trust my usual team.<eos> And that's where you come in.<eos> You can be the one to hunt him down.<eos> You trust the girl you've held captive for three blood years?<eos> "Trust" may be too strong a word.<eos> But after you see the results of our experiments, you'll be highly incentivized to do what I want.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Just... just feeling cold.<eos> Who could blame you in this horrid, damp basement?<eos> Every day, I dream I'll carry you away from this place.
It's poisonous to witches.<eos> Bring Enzo back to me alive, and I'll give you everything I have to heal her.<eos> No, please don't go.<eos> I have to.<eos> I'm going to save you.<eos> Hey, Martel, what's up?<eos> I got your text.<eos> I owe you for calling off the alert on the whole hostage hoax, so whatever you want, man.<eos> All he wants is to cooperate with me.<eos> I compelled him to summon you here while remaining silent and calm.
I brought up how long it's been.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I know what day it is.<eos> I've actually been thinking about it quite a bit.<eos> And...?<eos> And I realized that by the time he wakes up, I will probably be dead.<eos> So, uh, no.<eos> Never gonna call him again.<eos> And, likewise, he will never call you.
Don't flatter yourself.<eos> You did just say you spent the last three years spying on me.<eos> The Armory doesn't have TV.<eos> What else was I gonna do?<eos> Well, this isn't creepy at all.<eos> The point is, I know exactly where you are and what you're doing now.<eos> You're leading me towards the Armory.<eos> You're hoping they'll provide an assist.<eos> But Virginia's a long drive from here.<eos> Unless your car runs on something other than gas, you're not gonna make it there before I catch you.
You always knew having him in your orbit might get you killed someday.<eos> I thought getting me killed was your department.<eos> I'm plagued with a responsibility.<eos> That doesn't mean I like it.<eos> I actually think you're an okay person.<eos> Despite what Matt thinks.<eos> That guy really hates you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm starting to figure that out.<eos> He wouldn't let me out of my cell until I promised to put you back in the Hell Stone.
You never should have sent him there to meet her.<eos> Less blame, more magic.<eos> Go.<eos> I want to finish our conversation.<eos> I prefer our phone calls.<eos> It hurts me to see you like this, Stefan.<eos> I mean, it really hurts me.<eos> Because of our connection, I can feel what my targets feel.<eos> Like when Matt set me free at the Armory.<eos> As soon as I touched my sword, I felt what it did to you.
Previously on "Bates Motel"...<eos> The only reason that you are here is because I don't know how to help you.
I'll add your name to the list.<eos> Hello, it's Norma Bates.<eos> Leave a message, and I'll call you back.<eos> Hi, it's me.<eos> I just wanted to say that I hope you're doing okay getting through everything, and... and I'm sorry.<eos> I think you were right a-about...<eos> I've been confused about things and, uh...<eos> But I'm really working hard to get better now.<eos> I really think I can do it.<eos> I miss you very much, and I love you.
He's dust.<eos> He's nothing.<eos> You understand?<eos> I understand.<eos> People here...<eos> They can be so crazy.<eos> Show the doctor that you're feeling better, and then we can get you out of here, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you, honey.<eos> I love you too.
You said that Caleb was your brother.<eos> But when Caleb introduced himself, it was as Dylan's father.<eos> I mean, I only put this all together yesterday, but... there aren't that many ways that that adds up, right?<eos> I... you... you're probably confused.<eos> He's... he... Caleb's crazy.<eos> Do you want to be out of integrity with yourself, Norma?<eos> I want you to leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Just 'cause you slept with your brother?<eos> Are you ashamed because he raped you?
No, I haven't.<eos> I've seen them on TV and from the car once, but I've never been in an actual theater.<eos> Oh, yeah, I remember.<eos> We wanted to take you when you were little, but you had all that sensory weirdness.<eos> Yes, and I'm sure that's how the doctors suggested you refer to it.<eos> Very healthy, very supportive.<eos> I'm a teenager and I've never been to the movies.<eos> It's pretty sad.<eos> When I was a teenager, my mom died.<eos> Yeah, but she took you to the movies before she did, right?

Hey, you've been acting weird.<eos> What's with you?<eos> Why don't you guess?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I don't like this game.<eos> All right, then, I'll tell you.<eos> You embarrassed me in front of our friends.<eos> "Let the man finish his story."<eos> - Opening Labor Day weekend... - Oh, Frankie, come on.<eos> - I was trying to help you.
Yeah, not yet.<eos> Why don't you shut your fucking pie hole, Dickie?<eos> I'm just saying, you know, maybe sometimes it's better to just walk away from your problems.<eos> I ain't got no problems.<eos> In fact, half of what you just said went right over my head.<eos> But I figure every writer needs a great chapter one, am I right?<eos> Oh, yeah, 100%, yeah.<eos> Yeah. I'm about to give you yours.<eos> Come on.<eos> When I'm calling you.
He's very handsome.<eos> It's not happening tonight!<eos> I'm just getting to know him.<eos> _<eos> You're very hard to Internet-stalk.<eos> Privacy... it's not underrated.<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> Why'd you get a divorce?<eos> I wasn't suited for marriage.<eos> Huh. I can tell you that I'm definitely not thinking about my ex right now.
Thank you.<eos> Huh. Perhaps I've romanticized their friendship potential just a little.<eos> So, pacifiers?<eos> Oh, yes, definitely pacifiers.<eos> Wait, how about those?<eos> Two for $12?<eos> No, that's ridiculous.<eos> - Lookit, five for ten. - Yeah.<eos> But don't you think there's a reason for the price difference?<eos> - Yeah, they're trying to scam you.
Apparently, Petra knew that you sent me in.<eos> Shoot.<eos> I meant to tell you...<eos> And did you mean to tell me about the kiss?<eos> I mean, I just wouldn't have mentioned your name so many times, had I known.<eos> I don't know why I didn't.<eos> Well, Petra said...<eos> That's not true, I do know why.<eos> It's 'cause I still love you, Jane, I do.<eos> And I'm sorry that I lied to you, it's just that we were in such a good place before that and I just want to get back to that.
You have a verdict?<eos> We have, Your Honor.<eos> On the charges of rape and sodomy in the first degree, we find the defendants, Noel Panko and Bobby D'Amico, not guilty.<eos> Mr. D'Amico and Mr. Panko, you are free to go.<eos> The State of New York thanks the jury for their service.<eos> I'm a national joke.<eos> Nobody's gonna believe me, ever.<eos> Hey, Kristi.<eos> Kristi.<eos> I know exactly what those guys did to you.
We need some publicity stills.<eos> Maybe, uh, we could get the two of you dancing.<eos> I don't understand why Hef keeps promoting us this way, as a couple.<eos> Whatever the reason, he needs to stop.<eos> It's a marketable concept.<eos> I can see that.<eos> I assume he thinks it's sexy.<eos> But it sends the wrong message.<eos> It's borderline unprofessional.<eos> I'm sure it requires some explanation from you when you get home.
- Bring me some edibles.<eos> Brianna Logan.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> - Likewise.<eos> - I don't know what Mouse told you.<eos> - He said you used to be a lawyer and now you own a pot shop.<eos> - Well, I like to tell people that I entered a budding industry with growth potential.<eos> - I bet that always gets a laugh.<eos> - Usually a smile.<eos> Uh, so Mouse did my security system, and recommended you for security detail.

We know what you're hiding.<eos> Question.<eos> Why inmates?<eos> - My life's mission is social justice.<eos> And... I started communicating with inmates who were serving unfair sentences, and I f--<eos> I found out that, uh,<eos> I had so much in common with these men.<eos> I'm also a misfit.<eos> And a prisoner.<eos> - Yeah, well, one of these guys set you up.
I was talking to my son.<eos> Worth a shot.<eos> Give me a whiskey the size you'd need if you were still living with Dad.<eos> - Rough day with him?<eos> - Actually, I didn't see him all day.<eos> He was up in the loft with Rooster.<eos> I was scooping shit with Pedro's shovel.<eos> Now my back is killing me.<eos> I don't know who this Pedro guy was... must've been a very short man.<eos> Well, I still love you, sweetheart.

Long as I get to drive.<eos> Hell no.<eos> I'm not mad, honey.<eos> I'm just outnumbered.<eos> This place is way more of a fixer-upper than we thought.<eos> Like, I'm starting to see why it was on the market for so long.<eos> No, I know. You're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> One room at a time -- starting with this awful wallpaper.<eos> Yeah, love you, too. Love you, too, Maya.
All right, I got you.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> There we go. I'm getting too old for this.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It's Kat, right?<eos> Not supposed to talk to strangers.<eos> And that -- that is a solid rule.<eos> My name is Dean Winchester.<eos> See? Now I'm not a stranger.<eos> I'm here to get you out of this place.
You know, we always talk about taking a break, going camping.<eos> This could be like camping. It could be fun. Yeah, which part?<eos> Hmm? Freezing our nuts off in the middle of the woods on a thin lead?<eos> Yeah, that part.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Hey, what happened back there?<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I saved us.<eos> Look, you're hurt bad and...<eos> And I love you, Michelle.
Turn him on his side.<eos> He's alive.<eos> - He?<eos> - Sam?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Yeah, not so much.<eos> I need a - - I need a car. No.<eos> No, not a chance.<eos> Look, pal, I'm not asking.<eos> Hey, look, psycho, I got you for stealing and consuming a felony's worth of Schedule IV drugs, plus assaulting a police officer.
You two deserve each other.<eos> These are for you.<eos> People... people wanna think that that's what life is like, that it's flowers and hearts.<eos> But it's not.<eos> It's messy.<eos> Things get broken.<eos> I don't want you here 'cause you feel sorry for me.<eos> That's not why I'm here.<eos> I'm here because I love everything about you.<eos> No matter what happened to you, or what will happen to you, it's not all bad.
No! Sit down, Jake!<eos> There are bad people in this world, people who would seduce a man's wife, and someone has to do something about it.<eos> I'm from a different morality, product of another time.<eos> No one understands what I need to do for the greater good.<eos> There's nothing funny here.<eos> Well, sure there is.<eos> All this because I told him your dirty little secrets?<eos> Well, I didn't even tell him about your grandmother.<eos> She liked to wash you, didn't she?<eos> She washed you real good.
Where'd you go to school?<eos> Vanderbilt.<eos> You?<eos> Bates.<eos> I love you.<eos> You don't think it's too soon for that?<eos> I mean, we just met.<eos> Well, it's good to meet you.<eos> It's not too soon for me.<eos> I love you too.
I want you to come home.<eos> You shouldn't be taking charity.<eos> You shouldn't be staying here.<eos> You should be home with me.<eos> Ruth is kind.<eos> I need people who are kind.<eos> Please come home.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> We're married.<eos> I love Junie, I love you, and I love whoever this is.
What are you talking about?<eos> Lee, didn't you go fascist hunting?<eos> I wouldn't waste my time with Walker.<eos> It made the news.<eos> General shot.<eos> That wasn't you?<eos> Well, let's go for a drive, fascist hunter.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Just stay. Stay.<eos> I'll take you to my house.
Take 'em all.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't care about your "sorry."<eos> I'm not gonna sit here and let you forget about the reason why you came here.<eos> These pills aren't helping you.<eos> A man is gonna be murdered, Jake.<eos> You're the only one who can do anything about it.<eos> All right.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Just tell me what I said on the phone to you.
Go on, now.<eos> Cuff him.<eos> Can you help her?<eos> Please?<eos> Help her!<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Goddammit, will you just help her?<eos> - You're going away for a long time, boy.<eos> - Long time?<eos> Old Sparky waiting for you.
No worries.<eos> Sorry I'm moving kinda slow this morning.<eos> Slept over at Riley's last night, my neck's killing me.<eos> Slept wrong?<eos> Sure.<eos> Let's go with that.<eos> You know, I've been spending so much time over there lately, I'm thinking maybe we should move in together, but I'm worried it might be too soon.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think you're not thinking.<eos> You asked her to marry you before you had your first date, and you saw how quickly you regretted that.
You know what the worst part is?<eos> You don't even care about real estate, and you're good at it.<eos> I care and I fail.<eos> But this isn't even what I want to do with my life.<eos> Okay? You know, I still want to become an entertainment reporter.<eos> Yeah, well, a good time to mention that might have been when Luis gave you my job.<eos> Yeah, I might have got caught up in the moment.<eos> I just wish there was some way I could get a second chance.<eos> (elevator dings) Oh, so you're saying you're sorry you wasted all these months dating me?<eos> No, I'm saying I wasted the last 20 years being in love with you!
- Oh.<eos> Are you here to see your daddy?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Kiss.<eos> - Oh, um...<eos> no, thank you.<eos> - Oh, you don't want to kiss your grandma?<eos> - Well, you're not my grandma.<eos> You were my dad's dad's last girlfriend, so...<eos> - Well, that never stopped you before.
Everybody's gone, okay?<eos> Let us sell this place.<eos> Let us get on with our lives.<eos> We will get you nice place in Florida.<eos> You can get a mail order bride, you can fuck her mouth until you're dead.<eos> Our brother can go back to his accounting job with real live human beings and pretend he's one of them.<eos> - A 100 years, Sylvia.<eos> - 100 years of misery is enough, it's enough, Pete.<eos> Misery is something you get past, not something you pass on to your children.<eos> - Boy, if your father could hear you...
Just an unbroken chain of fucking saints,<eos> Horace after Horace, Peter after Pete, not an asshole in the bunch, and how this place thrived until this Horace and Pete.<eos> - Sounds right to me.<eos> - Yeah, tell yourself another story.<eos> Yeah, we're probably the worst Horace and Pete yet.<eos> I'm incompetent and he's unwilling, but whose fault is that, huh?<eos> How did this place survive for 100 years?<eos> A family business, how did it survive?<eos> (sighs)<eos> - Because all the Horace and Petes before you were good fathers, that's why.
It's Dad, thanks.<eos> (door opens)<eos> - How come Rachel was crying?<eos> - I asked her to... move out.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Man.<eos> - How long is that- that last Probitol gonna last?<eos> - About 12- 12 more hours.<eos> - Well, bottom line is that in about three days, we can get you more in three days, then you're back.
The babies, too?<eos> Yes. The babies, too.<eos> Petra... don't worry, we can do this.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Michael, I promise.<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> The last time my parents were together, it was a disaster.<eos> There was fighting, finger-pointing, tears... mostly mine, but still...<eos> Come on, they are not gonna do that in front of me.<eos> That's because the only thing they can agree on is how much they love you.
Sorry about that.<eos> I-If it makes any difference, I loved that book, too.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Hi. I heard you paid a little visit to my mom's book club.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't know they were all gonna be sitting there.<eos> No, don't apologize.<eos> It worked. My parents are coming to the party.<eos> Apparently the, uh, book club ladies were really feeling you.
I get choked up.<eos> And not like a single tear glistening down my cheek thing, but like...<eos> Oh, Dad, of course you're going to cry.<eos> It's a really traumatic thing that happened.<eos> I don't want people to see me as a victim.<eos> I want to seem like a powerful, extraordinary actor.<eos> You can be both.<eos> But what if people make fun of me... memes, GIFs?<eos> Or is it JIFs?<eos> Well, not everybody's gonna like you.
Yes, Rafael had decided that instead of no sex and babies, he would try sex and no babies for a change.<eos> Sorry I'm late. I keep missing that turn onto 3rd.<eos> You'll recall Rafael promised to try with Michael.<eos> Guess I need to give myself some more time.<eos> Yeah, gets confusing.<eos> So here he is, trying.<eos> Don't worry, it took me a while to figure out the neighborhood.<eos> And the traffic on the I-95 is the worst, so it's...<eos> In fact, I think it's safe to say that all three of them were finding this trying.<eos> So, I'll check in with you later and just tell you how he's doing.
Which brings us here now to the biggest acting challenge of Rogelio's career.<eos> Thank you, dear Lola.<eos> It's so hard to believe I once feared you.<eos> In some ways, it was working.<eos> Occasionally, she removed his arm shackles.<eos> See?<eos> But not in all ways.<eos> Another text from Jane?<eos> "Dad, it's been two weeks.<eos> I know I really hurt you and I'm sorry, but please stop shutting us out.
We'll wait.<eos> You need some prep time, anyway.<eos> So, what are you gonna say to Angelique?<eos> Trust me, I've been rehearsing this.<eos> I'm gonna say, "Do you remember me?<eos> You stole my idea. I left a chapter with you."<eos> And I threw it away...<eos> I don't accept unsolicited materials.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Toughening you up.
It's not just hers; it's mine too.<eos> Well, that's the hardest thing I've had to take in all day.<eos> And for lunch, they served us something called "brown."<eos> See, Daddy, this is where I belong.<eos> Well, not here, even though I will miss the lighting, but with Max.<eos> I guess I can support that.<eos> Look, I'm sorry. Sorry.<eos> You know, I worry, okay?<eos> That's what parents do, and there's lots of time to worry when you're in prison, which is why I focused all my energies on creating groundbreaking musical theater.<eos> Are you sure you didn't tell your dad that I told you that he told me to tell you that?
She calls Mickey Mouse "The Great Satan."<eos> Yeah, I don't think I should be involved in this.<eos> I'm Switzerland... cool, neutral.<eos> Very expensive.<eos> If you're not taking my side, you're taking her side.<eos> No, no sides.<eos> You're both my friends.<eos> Well, if she's such a great friend, then why did she tell me you can't really pull off a loose tank?<eos> - What? - Her words, not mine.<eos> Okay, it's super obvious you're just trying to manipulate me in helping you with your revenge plot.
What will you give me?<eos> How about you give us all the pages and we don't tell Amy you whack off to her private thoughts like a psycho?<eos> I-I accept these terms.<eos> I've got it.<eos> "What Shane and Lauren don't know "is that they're cut from the same cloth.<eos> They fight it, but they're destined to be best friends."<eos> both: She has no clue what she's talking about.<eos> Hey, let me give you a hand with that, uh, really big computer.<eos> It's a bench.<eos> Let me help you with the bench.
Red looks good on you.<eos> It's the color of betrayal.<eos> Well, good.<eos> Then maybe you should have some too, because you certainly know all about betraying.<eos> Me?<eos> I can't believe you weren't going to tell me that Dylan was cheating.<eos> Oh! I'm sorry.<eos> Did you think I owed you anything after you leaked my journal?<eos> At least I didn't abandon my best friend and then just assume she's the worst person in the world after she forgave you for sleeping with her ex-boyfriend, because that's what you did!<eos> That is because you forced me to kiss you over and over again, and then you rejected me.
[both exclaim] [both breathing heavily] Oh, sweet Bloody Mary.<eos> You saved me from the rat.<eos> I saved myself.<eos> I don't exactly love them.<eos> Liam told me that you didn't kiss Zita.<eos> I really didn't.<eos> [sighs] You know, I had to ask myself if I evolved, then why did it hurt so bad to see you kiss her?<eos> ♪ When you gonna live your life right? ♪ Why did that bring me right back to that shallow end of the pool?<eos> ♪ Oh, girls ♪ Maybe I'm not 100% over you, and maybe there's a part of me that never will be.<eos> ♪ The phone rings ♪ And maybe I kissed you in the pool because... ♪ What you gonna do with your life? ♪
Yes, but I just watched "Back to School"<eos> with Rodney Dangerfield.<eos> It's about this delightful old scamp who goes back to school, and it's hilarious, 'cause let's face it...<eos> A guy that old doesn't go back to school.<eos> But he does.<eos> He goes back to school but good.<eos> Are you done?<eos> I don't have to be.<eos> While Erica and my dad were struggling to get my mom on board, my friends were fighting their way through enemy territory.<eos> As you climb out of the pit, a band of marauding orcs awaits you.
Picking teams has been the same since the dawn of physical education.<eos> The awesome jocks choose kids in descending order of athletic ability.<eos> What is the problem?<eos> The problem is the rest of us suffer.<eos> Turns out, gym class will determine how society views us for the rest of our lives.<eos> People... really think that?<eos> Of course.<eos> Don't you realize gym is the most important class there is?<eos> Well, I know that.<eos> It's just, when the English department doesn't invite you out for bowling night, it... really gets in your head.
Okay, it's been two hours, and there's been a lot of wrestling and confusion on why D and D is a thing, but here we are, so let's just continue.<eos> Zinethar the priest, your move.<eos> My move is I change my name to Dick Biggens.<eos> You can't change your name.<eos> I meant you're facing a deadly, gelatinous cube.<eos> How do you evade it?<eos> Evade it?<eos> Let's kick that Jell-O's ass.<eos> It's a gelatinous cube.<eos> If you attack it, it'll slurp you up and digest you alive.
This is big.<eos> It almost justifies you dragging me out here - to brag about your progress. - Yeah.<eos> Someday when you're in a relationship, you'll get to experience all this, too.<eos> I am in a relationship.<eos> Remember Craig, the musician?<eos> I get all those Hollywood white guys mixed up.<eos> - Oh, my... - That's the beauty of Catherine.<eos> She's diverse.<eos> She looks like our country.<eos> Remind why I agreed to help you.
Hey, I'm gonna get out of here.<eos> Why don't you hide that?<eos> That's probably best for me.<eos> Hey, what time is the main event?<eos> Uh, don't answer that.<eos> Hi, Jimmy.<eos> Hi.<eos> I just came by to tell you that I borrowed 20 bucks from Ravi, and I have no intention of ever paying him back.<eos> Catherine, you're amazing.<eos> And I really like you, and I know I was an idiot.
Everything okay?<eos> Or is this Ken doll giving you a problem?<eos> This is weird.<eos> I guess so.<eos> It's just that usually when I have a big fight with a guy,<eos> - that's how it goes.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I know exactly what you mean.<eos> Sounds like the beginning of a beautiful threesome.<eos> Listen, Rick,<eos> I know I invited you here, but get out.
It just will.<eos> Why aren't you worried about this?<eos> Gerald, nothing about you and me should work.<eos> - Not helping.<eos> - Think about it.<eos> We got pregnant when we weren't even dating, we both still live with our families, my grandmother hates white people.<eos> Since when do we care about that stuff?<eos> I love you.<eos> Even during movie night, I loved you.<eos> I love you, too.
And Will got a job at a college up there.<eos> Soon like...<eos> Like, in a month?<eos> I don't know, a few days?<eos> Norma, it's gonna... It's gonna be fine.<eos> I promise, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna disappear.<eos> You should come to dinner some night before you leave, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'll call you, all right?
I'm right here, Norman.<eos> I thought you didn't want to be seen with me.<eos> I don't.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> How much money do you want?<eos> I don't...<eos> Hey, Dylan.<eos> It's your dad.<eos> Hey. Hey, how are you?<eos> Did Norma call you?
Yeah, he's just got the window...<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> He said, "I got the window.<eos> I could use some help unloading it."<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> I just, um...<eos> I love you.<eos> I want you to know that.<eos> You're telling me this right now?<eos> Well, I love you too.
And why is Susan hiding him?<eos> You're holding out on me.<eos> - I'm not sure what you mean.<eos> - Susan Ross.<eos> Oh. Yeah, I was wondering why she was still standing.<eos> You know what I want.<eos> You want me to say I knew John Latner wasn't her baby daddy, and you want my source so you can track down Casey's biological father.<eos> You can't knock me for trying to squirrel a little something away for winter.<eos> I've got a general election to win.<eos> You won't make it to the general unless you use what I gave you on Edison.
That's you...<eos> Cheated on the person in the relationship without one...<eos> that's me...<eos> And that we are looking for a way out that doesn't make me look bad.<eos> I don't want to fake it anymore either, but there is no version of us breaking up that looks good for me, unless you're willing to say that I left you because you're an impotent alcoholic<eos> who hates kids and dogs and God.<eos> Are you willing to say that?<eos> Yes, I will say that.<eos> I will say whatever you want me to say.<eos> But what I want to say to you, Susan, is that I love you.
- And I thought of you, Horace, and I thought of how when I found out about you and Rosemary and how much I hated you and how-<eos> And how could you do that to the family, you know, to the kids and to me and to yourself?<eos> And then- and then, I was like, oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> The guy was 21, I was 32, and I married him.<eos> I mean, I made him marry me.<eos> It's not that hard to make a guy that age do what you want.<eos> He's so used to still listening to his mother.<eos> And so, I just thought, how was that like for you?<eos> 'Cause, I mean, I had never thought about how- How was it like for you?<eos> - So you thought that maybe I could help you now because I went through it when I cheated on you?
I think that's quite obvious, Your Majesty.<eos> You got lucky last time we met.<eos> Now you tell me where I am or I run you through.<eos> Well, you can't kill a dead man, I'm afraid.<eos> Are you having a hard time accepting it?<eos> But you know where you are.<eos> But I had so much left to do.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> I promised someone that I would move on from this place, but I still bloody can't, so I need to know what the hell is going on up in Storybrooke.<eos> Who killed you?
Well, you can't kill a dead man, I'm afraid.<eos> Are you having a hard time accepting it?<eos> But you know where you are.<eos> But I had so much left to do.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> I promised someone that I would move on from this place, but I still bloody can't, so I need to know what the hell is going on up in Storybrooke.<eos> Who killed you?<eos> Denial, grief, anger.<eos> Can we just get to acceptance?<eos> Who killed you?
I understand, but it's better you follow up on that with your cardiologist.<eos> My cardiologist is an arrogant SOB.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Fine.<eos> I'll have cardiothoracic down to take a look.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Man, do I hate that stuff.<eos> It's a lot worse without it.<eos> I have a feeling you know the drill.<eos> I haven't seen you in a while.
So why'd you really ask me in here?<eos> I'm starting an investigation.<eos> I didn't want you blindsided.<eos> This could get ugly.<eos> Where are your parents?<eos> My dad took my brother and sister home.<eos> My mom's in the bathroom.<eos> She'll be right back.<eos> Well, that's okay.<eos> I just came in to check on you.
Is someone making you do this?<eos> No, no. It's my decision.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Hey, hey, look, look.<eos> I get it.<eos> I screwed up.<eos> But you're supposed to be here for me, not dime me out.<eos> You know what?<eos> You... you're just pissed because I'm the doctor and you're not.<eos> Noah, you are my brother, and I love you...
Detective Dawson. Intelligence.<eos> I need to have a word with him.<eos> You can have it down at Med.<eos> We're about to roll out.<eos> You can wait a minute.<eos> Who shot you, Jesse?<eos> I need medical treatment now.<eos> You tell me who shot you, you're on your way.<eos> I didn't get a good look.<eos> Why'd they come after you?
My goodness, so dramatic.<eos> Please tell your daughter I'm going to be fine.<eos> -The two of you can just run along.<eos> -Oh, no. I'm gonna have Luke drive her.<eos> -You're staying?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Grandma...<eos> You made him very proud.<eos> - I will call you when I get to London.
I just lost my father!<eos> And you couldn't care less!<eos> That's horrible.<eos> You're horrible.<eos> Get out!<eos> First the help, then me.<eos> Seems about right.<eos> Go home!<eos> Go back to your beloved town with its carnies and misfits.<eos> Tell them how your intolerable mother yelled at you at your father's funeral.
Did I tell you she lost her shoes at the club?<eos> -You did not. -I didn't notice until we were leaving.<eos> She was walking as if she had shoes on. I mention it and she said,<eos> "I left them somewhere." How do you do that?<eos> It's snowing outside.<eos> -See?<eos> Weird.<eos> -Weird makes good copy.<eos> -So does a great writer.<eos> -Those pants did put you in a good mood.
That was before Brett Ratner gave him the keys to his pool house.<eos> Okay, ladies.<eos> You have arrived.<eos> -Thanks, Kirk.<eos> -You're welcome.<eos> Come again. -And does Lane have an extension cord?<eos> -I'll see.<eos> I know you guys were friends, but if push came to shove, and we had to make T-shirts...<eos> -Team Paris all the way.<eos> -Thanks. Can you say he felt you up at a party for the deposition?
And take them out and bring them back?<eos> Or leave them in an alley. One of those two things.<eos> -Thank you, Rory.<eos> -Yeah, thanks, Rory.<eos> Bye, guys. Kiss the kids again.<eos> - What?<eos> Are you and Doyle having an affair? Waiting...<eos> Waiting... Hey, there.<eos> Oh, shoot. Did I wake you up?<eos> I woke you up.
He's Richard Gilmore.<eos> This is not how Richard Gilmore goes down.<eos> -You know what his last words were?<eos> "Get the hell away from me."<eos> Aimed at the nurses, not... not us.<eos> It was actually pretty funny.<eos> And then... just like that.<eos> I didn't get that moment, you know?<eos> That Lifetime movie moment,<eos> "I love you, Lorelai." "I love you too, Dad."
-It's shaped like a teacup.<eos> And it's near a prison.<eos> Just closing' up, fellas.<eos> Hi.<eos> I know you're sick of hearing this, but this movie, History of Violence?<eos> Viggo Mortensen is you.<eos> -He's totally you.<eos> -I know. You've said it before.<eos> David Cronenberg owes you money.<eos> He must have dropped by the diner, got inspired, and turned you into this ex-thug guy.
This isn't you.<eos> Panicking, lying...<eos> -I didn't lie. -Ah, you didn't tell me about Logan.<eos> -What's with not telling me about stuff?<eos> -I don't know. -Why didn't you tell me about Logan?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> I just... I'm feeling very lost these days.<eos> This whole past year, it's like the ground's made of straw.<eos> I'm just gonna fall through.<eos> Look, life has been pretty good to you so far.
I'm just gonna fall through.<eos> Look, life has been pretty good to you so far.<eos> It was your turn for a few curveballs. Peaks and valleys, kid.<eos> The older you get, the more you have.<eos> That whole line story was so stupid.<eos> I did it because they thought it was interesting.<eos> I didn't have a beat on it.<eos> I didn't feel it. I'm just a big, fat, Wookiee-humping loser with no future.<eos> Wait. What about that website?<eos> The one that's been after you forever, begging you to come work for them?
No, no, no. We had a whole morning planned.<eos> Uh... no one's naked yet. You can't just rush off like this.<eos> Logan, tell her!<eos> I don't think she's listening to me anymore.<eos> But... when will we see you again?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Oh, this is it?<eos> This is goodbye?<eos> No.<eos> - We love you, Rory.
- Well then, we'll walk.<eos> - Will we?<eos> How novel.<eos> So this is walking?<eos> I don't care for it actually.<eos> - Sure you don't want breakfast?<eos> - I'm sure.<eos> - I'd like to drive you back.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I dragged you out here...
I waited for him to yell at me, to punish me, to ground me forever, to tell me how disappointed he was in me.<eos> And nothing came.<eos> And finally, I got up enough courage... to look up at him, and he was standing there... with a pretzel.<eos> A giant pretzel covered with mustard.<eos> And he handed it to me and he said, "Let's go."<eos> And he took me to the movies.<eos> We saw Grease and An Unmarried Woman.<eos> Something for me and something for him, he said.<eos> He bought me popcorn and Red Hots, and we sat in the dark and we watched.<eos> And then he took me home, and he gave me his sweater to cover up the stolen top, and he told you that he'd picked me up from school and taken me to the club for a soda.
So, now, all these years later, how do you feel about that?<eos> It was in the cards.<eos> Lorelai and you, from the first moment I saw you two together, no one was getting between you guys.<eos> Maybe that's why she's getting married now.<eos> You're grown.<eos> Her job is done.<eos> Now she can let someone else in.<eos> - She didn't let you in?<eos> - I'm not saying that.<eos> Is that why you weren't there? She made the decision and she pushed you away?
No, it was still operating in the black.<eos> But the paper's editor, Bernie Roundbottom-- Come on.<eos> Bernie retired as editor, and there's no one to take his place.<eos> -Oh, well.<eos> -It had a good run.<eos> Eighty-nine years, not bad.<eos> Really? Am I the only one who's in shock over this news?<eos> Well, I had discussed the possibility of the Gazette shutting down at an earlier meeting, before you were back.<eos> I'm not back.<eos> I figured the Thirtysomething Gang would've filled you in by now.
-You know why.<eos> Are you doing this? Are you siccing the mountain man on me?<eos> The couple from New York wants to know if the meat is Pat LaFrieda?<eos> -What?<eos> -Is it Pat LaFrieda?<eos> The couple from New York wants to know if I ground up some guy named Pat LaFrieda and served him?<eos> Tell them yeah.<eos> Give them this. They'll like it.<eos> I put Pat's pancreas in there.<eos> Luke, hon, have I thanked you lately for hosting Tuesday Burger Day at the Dragonfly?
-No.<eos> About your relationships.<eos> -You and Jess and Dean.<eos> -They'll be in it, too.<eos> Don't forget to include Logan, the guy you just can't quit.<eos> -It's not fair.<eos> -It's my life, Rory.<eos> I went to all this effort for many, many years, making sure people only knew what I wanted them to.<eos> Now you're gonna put it all in a book?<eos> I don't want my mother finding out I left you in a bucket in a hardware store in chapter six.
-It's not fair.<eos> -It's my life, Rory.<eos> I went to all this effort for many, many years, making sure people only knew what I wanted them to.<eos> Now you're gonna put it all in a book?<eos> I don't want my mother finding out I left you in a bucket in a hardware store in chapter six.<eos> -Are you kidding me?<eos> -You're 32 years old.<eos> She'll still petition the court to have you taken away.<eos> This is such an overreaction.<eos> Really? Do you know that your grandmother called you Susan until you were two?
Having a hot affair at 10:30 every Tuesday morning?<eos> That's early for a nooner.<eos> Let's see. Who could it be with?<eos> Uh, maybe the morning food delivery guy?<eos> Or Lou, the guy who wears a wool cap even in summer?<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I'm not having an affair.<eos> Of course not. You're going to therapy by yourself.<eos> I mean, your mother dragged you into it, but then you fell in love with it and you threw her out.
Here's your fucking truth.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> We can't just hang around London on the off-chance that we bump into him.<eos> I knew we should have put a tag on him.<eos> "Please look after this Howard."<eos> - We've gotta get on the coach. - Yeah.<eos> Just hope he finds his way back, like a big, bearded homing pigeon.<eos> Wait.<eos> Look.<eos> We've found you.
I don't ever want to talk to you ever again, you evil fucking woman!<eos> I love you.<eos> Please stay with me until after my finals.<eos> Good luck with your exams.<eos> Ciao.<eos> Don't say ciao, you fucking Swiss phoney!<eos> WHIRRING STOPS<eos> JP!<eos> With regret, it has become necessary for me to beg safe passage aboard the revision barge.<eos> Very well, I will add you to the manifest right now.
Previously on "Grimm"...<eos> I talked to Sean Renard.<eos> It's Diana.<eos> He said she's with the resistance.<eos> I think he's gonna to use Diana to get to me for some reason.<eos> If the Captain is working with Black Claw, they're going to use Adalind to get to you.
We were staking out Monroe.<eos> I saw that guy move toward him.<eos> I thought, "Okay, here we go."<eos> I woke up here.<eos> Did you get the guy?<eos> Oh, he's been got.<eos> Well, for some reason, the guy who was supposed to go after<eos> Monroe ended up going after you instead.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, he dragged you in front of his van.
Drew, how you feeling?<eos> Heard you got banged up pretty good.<eos> Uh, I'm okay.<eos> I was gonna come by the hospital, but you were already gone.<eos> It's good to have you back.<eos> Yeah, it's Theo.<eos> Not many tears are gonna be shed over this hombre.<eos> You guys ready to let CSU have it?<eos> Yeah, let them have it.<eos> This the guy that attacked you?
Yeah, he's definitely been here awhile.<eos> He's got your address.<eos> Why was he watching me?<eos> It's not like I'm the only cop who's ever arrested him.<eos> He could be with Black Claw.<eos> I'm texting Trubel to see if Delano's in their database.<eos> So you were going to see Rosalee because of those dreams?<eos> I think they're more than just dreams.<eos> I think something's happening to me.<eos> We're taking you to the Spice Shop.
It might help you to remember.<eos> - I'll go get it.<eos> - What are the side effects?<eos> You remember the stuff your brain spent a lot of time burying in the deepest, darkest recesses of your mind.<eos> One teaspoon should do the trick.<eos> Drink this as fast as you can.<eos> You want the effect to come all at once.<eos> What if this isn't the only time I've killed someone?<eos> The best thing you can do is calm down.<eos> We'll get you through this.

I know.<eos> Alice feels really bad about what she said.<eos> And I feel really bad about what I said, too.<eos> It was just...<eos> It was so weird.<eos> Listen, Paige.<eos> The hardest thing we do in our jobs is trust.<eos> We never know for sure if other people are telling us the truth.<eos> But the one thing Dad and I have is we tell each other the truth.<eos> And now that we told you about us, you're part of that.
They said he might not have made it had I not done that.<eos> I'm sorry, Elijah.<eos> I know how hard this must be for you.<eos> Nina, listen to me very carefully.<eos> I'm having you banned from this hospital and then I am filing a restraining order.<eos> If you call or text or come within 50 feet of anyone in my family-- anyone-- you will be arrested.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I'm an agent with the FBI.<eos> Don't test me.<eos> I'm just trying to help you.
Eh...<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> (laughs)<eos> And promise me you will show up to your chemo treatments, so you don't end up back in the hospital.<eos> I'm not gonna live much longer.<eos> You know that.<eos> Dad, come-- look, come on. (stammers)<eos> It's true.<eos> Uh...<eos> I love you, son.
All right, you know what?<eos> I'm gonna check another room.<eos> And I got a good feeling about this one.<eos> I can feel his presence.<eos> - Kenny! - You're alive!<eos> Oh, man!<eos> He's like a dog.<eos> He found his way home.<eos> Oh, Kenny's leaving?<eos> It was kind of nice having you here.
- Thank you, Dad.<eos> You look good, too, young man. You look good.<eos> - Okay, Dad, can we go now?<eos> - All right, hold on. Need a...<eos> Need a picture, please.<eos> All right, got you.<eos> All right, you guys.<eos> What, I don't get no love?<eos> - All right.<eos> I love you. - Love you, too.
It's unlocked.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I thought you were Lucca.<eos> You want, uh... you want me to come back?<eos> I'm eating pizza.<eos> That is the saddest piece of pizza I've ever seen.<eos> Yes, like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.<eos> I'm not even hungry.<eos> I think...<eos> I think that I offended you.
No.<eos> It seems like a girl thing.<eos> We'll make an allowance.<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Pretty fast for an associate to get an office, isn't it?<eos> Lucca's good.<eos> Seems like yesterday when we were.<eos> So, I have to ask...<eos> Did Diane approach you about making this an all-female firm, pushing me out?
I bought it at the flea market.<eos> So you can't do anything?<eos> WOMAN: No.<eos> You have the wrong person.<eos> What a shame.<eos> [Screaming, gasping] [Choking] Please...<eos> He's out there.<eos> Who is out there?<eos> The Wolf.<eos> The one who betrayed you.
When is this?<eos> As the next Blood Moon rises over the Valley of the Bear.<eos> They... will meet...<eos> What else do you see?<eos> [Distant laughter of children] MALE VOICE: [Gently] Elena, stay close.<eos> I know. I know it's a lot to take in.<eos> A father, family, out of the blue.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> From Sofia.<eos> She was a nurse at the hospital where I left you.
Previously on "Bitten".<eos> - Who is out there?<eos> - The Wolf.<eos> The one who betrayed you.
Yeah, sure, you made me do it for months.<eos> It's the same idea with other objects.<eos> You find the balance point.<eos> You throw overhand; you use the strongest muscles<eos> - in the shoulder.<eos> - Yeah, I get it.<eos> I'm not stupid, Dad.<eos> No, no, you're not stupid.<eos> But you're young.<eos> These things that I'm teaching you, you will need them one day.
Bring them to us and we get on a plane to Russia.<eos> I promise.<eos> We will sit still until then.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> They've been watching us the entire time.<eos> Take it easy, you two.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> Move, woman.<eos> Earl, get your car out of here.<eos> What did I tell you about double parking?
Nick.<eos> Ah.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You see... the bond between our Packs is strong.<eos> I will not forget this, Jeremy.<eos> Put them in my car. I will leave tonight.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> There was a time when I would've helped you, Roman.
When I heard that David was coming, I didn't want to intrude.<eos> Then I realized how foolish that was.<eos> I suppose we should talk, shouldn't we?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We should.<eos> Come on, Kai.<eos> 29 years.<eos> 29 years you didn't tell me that I had a daughter.<eos> You're right.<eos> And when I found out, I called and texted you for a week straight and never got one reply.
Missed me?<eos> Sorry, I haven't called.<eos> I told Dad, I've been so busy with my job and my volunteer work.<eos> Oh, would you shut up?<eos> You wanna know how I know you're lying?<eos> Your lips are moving.<eos> Now, tell me what you're really into.<eos> Mostly yoga, meditation, just trying to find balance in life.<eos> You do not want to mess with me today.<eos> I am trying to help you.
You do not want to mess with me today.<eos> I am trying to help you.<eos> By the way, you're so good at this policing thing.<eos> If I didn't know you, I would be terrified right now.<eos> Hey, how are Jake and the boys?<eos> What are they, five now?<eos> Oh, the boys are eight.<eos> And Jake is 44, and we're divorced.<eos> Lucy, listen to me.<eos> If they had found you before I did, you would be on your way right now to Rikers on murder charges.
We watch out for each other, we help each other.<eos> Dad, I am trying to help Lucy.<eos> Truly.<eos> The people that she is involved with are no joke.<eos> The safest place for her right now is here in holding.<eos> Spoken like a true representative of the police state.<eos> The '60s called, they want their bullcrap back.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> I am here as the legal counsel for Lucy Diamond, and I demand her immediate release.<eos> Sorry to break it to you, but being disbarred means that you are no longer a lawyer.
Okay, how much?<eos> 50,000.<eos> But we owed 100.<eos> Ian blew the rest.<eos> Ah, surprise, surprise.<eos> When Jimmy caught on, Ian wanted to buy us some time.<eos> He made up a story about landing a buyer, who could handle all of the pills that Jimmy had stacked up.<eos> A whale.<eos> But, I guess our time ran out.<eos> If you had told me the truth from the beginning, I could've helped you.
[Sighs] I didn't ask, he didn't say.<eos> But I do know that after your two weeks in Thailand, your undercover mission for the CIA was over and you were supposed to go home.<eos> But instead you went rogue and you came to L.A.<eos> To keep tabs on you, I borrowed a GPS tracker from a friend of mine, Malcolm.<eos> And I placed it...<eos> In my watch.<eos> That was you.<eos> Yeah, only you left it in that Korean restaurant.<eos> So I lost track of you.<eos> And by the time I found you, you'd been shot in the side.
And I placed it...<eos> In my watch.<eos> That was you.<eos> Yeah, only you left it in that Korean restaurant.<eos> So I lost track of you.<eos> And by the time I found you, you'd been shot in the side.<eos> Who shot me?<eos> You wouldn't say.<eos> You did mention your CIA handler, a guy named Jenkins.<eos> You said that you were going to go and ask him to erase everything that had happened to you here.
What was that combination?<eos> 4 left... 17 right... 21 left.<eos> I'll step out.<eos> No, no.<eos> You've, um...<eos> You've earned the right to see this.<eos> Hey, there, buddy.<eos> It's me.<eos> And by "me," I mean you.<eos> And if you are seeing this, then you are an idiot, because you are trying to figure out what happened to you in Los Angeles.
Have you had any issue with the superintendent?<eos> I haven't, why?<eos> - Luisito, how are you! - Fine!<eos> - Can you prepare some mate?<eos> - Yes, Mr. Alberto.<eos> He's asking questions.<eos> He wants to know about you.<eos> The whole village is on the alert.<eos> I have a friend in Mendoza.<eos> He'll help you.
Don't miss this chance.<eos> I'll be waiting for you tomorrow morning.<eos> Don't let me down.<eos> We're approaching the area.<eos> Proceed!<eos> Open the gate!<eos> Open the gate!<eos> What's wrong, Kóblic?<eos> Open the gate!<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
You were a new boss, you just stole an election.<eos> I didn't steal.<eos> I wanted to make sure you paid me.<eos> Really... you thought I wouldn't pay you?<eos> Hey, I been screwed over by a lot of people.<eos> Like who?<eos> Who screwed you over?<eos> Oh, people I used to work with.<eos> What people?<eos> I'm not trying to interrogate you.
- What?<eos> You said $30,000.<eos> Well, look, I didn't ask him to lose it.<eos> He was going to invest it.<eos> And then I get... this letter.<eos> Gino Davidson?<eos> Yeah, yeah, what's... I mean, what's wrong with that?<eos> You know, it's very racist of you to think there's something wrong with that name.<eos> I thought David Lee was investing for you.<eos> Did he connect you with this guy?
Uh, we have to talk to you a minute about firm business.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Your office.<eos> - No, your office.<eos> - Diane will see us in my office.<eos> Yes. And that's what we want.<eos> Alicia, we're worried Diane is making a power play for the firm.<eos> Yes, I've heard about your concern, Cary,<eos> - but I think it's just paranoia.<eos> - Diane hasn't reached out to you to join her?
No.<eos> A year ago you asked me,<eos> "Why not make it an all-female firm?"<eos> I know.<eos> But you've changed your mind?<eos> I have become, uh, more temperate.<eos> But what is it that you want?<eos> I want to be of use.<eos> No, you don't, Alicia.<eos> I've watched you over the years.
I have supported this president above and beyond for his entire term.<eos> Well, now it's about the second term.<eos> And I serve at the pleasure of the President.<eos> So do you, Tom.<eos> Don't they realize what a huge asset you are for them?<eos> Langdon actually tried to pass it off as a promotion.<eos> Uh, you can't take this lying down.<eos> - How else do you want me to take it?<eos> - Fight.<eos> Look, he appointed you, but he can't fire you.
There was a little overlap while she made up her mind.<eos> Okay, that's still cheating.<eos> I mean, how does this not bother you?<eos> It's wrong.<eos> I mean, we never would've done that to each other.<eos> Right.<eos> Allison, did you overlap me?<eos> What?<eos> ! That's crazy.<eos> I mean, when I met you, I was dating Billy Tanaka, but I dumped him because you were so great.
Who remembers?<eos> Thank you for finally admitting that.<eos> Oh, come on. You're not really...<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Apricot.<eos> Remember this?<eos> What?<eos> Our third date at the Santa Monica pier.<eos> I won you a framed poster of Penny Hardaway at the Pop-A-Shot.<eos> I kissed you on the Ferris wheel, and we heard fireworks.
Dylan, you can back me up here.<eos> Audrey was a mess at the hospital, yeah?<eos> You met my mother?<eos> Dylan, please tell her.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I didn't want to upset you.<eos> You, uh,<eos> - you left this.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So your, uh, your... your dad finally told you that she came to the hospital.
I want you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Oh, Nurse Penny said I could have ten more minutes.<eos> Oh, that's fine.<eos> Just wanted to talk to you.<eos> - May I? Uh? - Of course.<eos> I feel like I owe you an apology.<eos> Why?<eos> You're smart. You're capable.<eos> You can understand more than many of my other patients, and, as a result, I think I pushed you too hard.
- Uh, Norma.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So when are you gonna tell him?<eos> I-I... I-I'll do it when it makes sense, okay?<eos> I promise it's... it won't take forever.<eos> I promise.<eos> No, no, no, no, I get it.<eos> Okay. Thank you for understanding.<eos> I love you.<eos> Yeah. I love you too.
- What? What?<eos> Well... Di... did you know Norman came to see me this morning?<eos> He must have done it while I was out.<eos> He didn't tell me anything.<eos> Well, he thanked me for, uh, everything I've done for him.<eos> Well, that's nice.<eos> That's a nice thing for him to do. Yeah, then he told me that you and I could get a divorce now.<eos> That, uh, he's gonna get a part-time job and pay for his own insurance.<eos> - What?<eos> He thinks I manipulated you.
- What's going on?<eos> - I don't know, Norman.<eos> I-I don't know what's going on.<eos> You know why? Because no one tells me anything.<eos> Things that you do. Things that affect my life.<eos> I mean, but why talk to me about anything?<eos> I mean, what am I?<eos> Like a doll?<eos> And the menfolk are gonna hash out who gets the woman and the homestead?<eos> Oh, I see. So he told you.
That is so beautiful.<eos> And how about you?<eos> How about you and your ex?<eos> Are you close?<eos> Uh, uh... very close.<eos> Yeah, extremely close.<eos> Bill and I have found, um...<eos> Um, his name is Bill.<eos> But as long as we can sit down and take each other by the hand and really just say, you know,<eos> "Honey, you know how much I love you and I value you," um, then everything that comes after that just goes so much more easily.
Um, Jenny's at her friend Rebecca's house, and Howie and Johnny are at Tommy Hershfeld's.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Well, they were supposed to be with me tonight, you knew I'd made plans with them.<eos> You didn't think to call?<eos> It must have slipped my mind, Bill.<eos> Excuse me. Is there a black and white cape back there?<eos> So you made me go all the way over there?<eos> I'm sorry, Bill.<eos> Did I selfishly inconvenience you?<eos> Did I thoughtlessly capitulate to the children without any concern for how it affected you?
The only thing that I ever saw you be truly passionate about was your work.<eos> I didn't demand your passion. I just wanted you home for dinner.<eos> Stability above all else.<eos> It's pretty tragic, huh?<eos> No, don't say that.<eos> - It's true. - It...<eos> It's not tragic.<eos> We did our best.<eos> We made three children.<eos> And I loved you, Libby.
Well, I hear they put that on hold.<eos> I gather there's been some kind of... thaw.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow, bright and early.<eos> The husband's a real philanderer, and the wife's dyspareunia presents as almost completely psychosomatic.<eos> It did not begin until she discovered her husband...<eos> T-there's... something, b-before we go up there, that I need to tell you.<eos> What is it?<eos> I get the feeling someone's been listening in on our conversations.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> A-a few of the things I've said to you behind closed doors have... been repeated back to me.
You know, he's been such a constant in my life.<eos> Like family.<eos> And since our family is no longer what it was, and, uh,<eos> Virginia and I are... are no longer what we were...<eos> Might I suggest that you consider dating.<eos> Dating? Libby.<eos> Why not?<eos> I am.<eos> Who?<eos> Bram Keller. ...asked you out?
- Who is this nutsack?<eos> - Language, Wynonna.<eos> My imaginary friend.<eos> - You adorable psycho. - Haha!<eos> What was his name again?<eos> Bongo?<eos> Bill...<eos> Bilbo? Where's my head?<eos> I forgot the carrots.<eos> The revenants that took you; recognize them
- Like hell I will!<eos> - Wynonna, get the gun!<eos> - Wh-what? ! What gun?<eos> Where gun?<eos> Bossman said I'd never take it from you.<eos> Can't wait to prove him wrong.<eos> Get it off!<eos> Get it off!<eos> It burns!<eos> We're gonna get you.
- Uh, well, who doesn't, right?<eos> I'm an Earp.<eos> I-I m... I mean... I mean, "Earper."<eos> I'm an "Earper" too. Yeah.<eos> Found most of this stuff myself.<eos> Don't you try to go up against me on eBay now.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.<eos> You know, I've got Wyatt's original holster up in my apartment.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, which I am definitely not inviting you up to by the way.
- That sneaky son of a bitch!<eos> - Yeah, well, most of my stolen stuff was returned, OK?<eos> And he's just one of those crazy Wyatt fans.<eos> Hmm...<eos> No, he's definitely one of the good guys.<eos> Everything in my body tells me he's one of the bad boys.<eos> My entire body.<eos> Don't you think he's a little old for you?<eos> Careful now, I can still demote you to Black Badge mascot.<eos> I've been blaming you for what happened to Daddy... to Willa.
Not even sure we're the good guys.<eos> Well, good guys seem to be in short supply these days.<eos> Believe me... you are definitely one of them.<eos> It's tough, but it'll pass.<eos> Great pep talk.<eos> Shorty's dead, Revenants can body snatch people, and we don't know how to ID them.<eos> Not to mention, there's a witch out there toying with Revenants via high-risk spells.<eos> - Doesn't mean they won't try it again though, right?<eos> Found the tracker you stuck behind my ear.<eos> - The hell took you so long?
But you didn't ask?<eos> Why didn't you just ask her,<eos> "Why didn't you answer my proposal?"<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Why would you not ask?<eos> "It's been quite some time since we last spoke."<eos> "Dear Dody, has it really been nearly 30 years?<eos> How time flies."<eos> "I hope this letter finds you well.<eos> I've considered writing you now and then over the years, curious to know where life may have led you.
Or we could just stay in.<eos> Oh, there's a-a fried chicken place across the street.<eos> It doesn't matter to me.<eos> W-well, um, why don't... why don't we have a-a conversation here?<eos> - Oh. - Just get some things - out of the way?<eos> Your husband said that I-I broke your heart... all those years ago.<eos> I... honestly, I-I don't... I don't know what I did.<eos> Unless maybe you saw my note as-as some kind of joke?<eos> - Your note?<eos> - Yeah, the-the note I sent you at the hospital with the roses... the two dozen long-stemmed roses.
No, don't be.<eos> Rejected again.<eos> No misunderstanding this time.<eos> Don't talk like that.<eos> - I should go.<eos> - No. Dody, please.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> I'm just a silly woman who's read too many romance novels.<eos> Good luck to you, Bill.<eos> Maybe the next woman who wants to love you... you'll be brave enough to let her.
I'm tired of pretending.<eos> Pretending what?<eos> That I can continue to stomach our arrangement.<eos> That I still want to be with other men and that I don't mind you being with other women.<eos> You don't want me to be with other women?<eos> I know that before we got married, I was the one who insisted on this setup, but I didn't know that when you wake up with someone every morning, pour each other coffee, split the-the newspaper, that you want to go to bed with that person every night too.<eos> You want to be monogamous.<eos> But I know that that would be constricting for you.<eos> I know how much you love the openness and variety that swinging brings.<eos> I love you more, Nancy.
Correct.<eos> You're wondering how they got it.<eos> It's obvious how they got it.<eos> You left it on the bureau last night. a pair of charlatans, two therapists posing as patients to steal our material.<eos> Which means we need stricter screening procedures for all potential new patients, and our lawyer advised us to get signed copies of this from all staff members by the beginning of next week.<eos> That includes Guy and Lester.<eos> A non-disclosure agreement?<eos> Is that really necessary? Well, the last thing we want is somebody coming to work at the clinic, and then leaving with our work and starting a rival business.<eos> No. No, of course that makes sense.<eos> I'm surprised the phone didn't wake you this morning.
Paging Mrs. Johnson.<eos> Daddy. I wasn't expecting to see you till tonight.<eos> I thought we were meeting for dinner at the Marmaduke.<eos> Your mother wanted to spend the afternoon shopping, and you know how I get around department stores.<eos> Yes, like it's the Bataan Death March.<eos> Actually, um, I was wondering if I could have a moment of your time.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I've have to level with you, honey.<eos> We didn't come here just to see Lisa... although we did bring plenty of presents, don't you worry about that.<eos> I suppose it clicked for me when I saw you at that seminar last week.
God, I don't even know.<eos> Was there a particular time in your marriage that you remember sex being the most satisfying?<eos> Well, um... in the beginning, we really couldn't go a day or two... without...<eos> Have you ever been unfaithful in your marriage?<eos> It's a standard intake question I have to ask.<eos> Hmm. Um, the answer's no.<eos> Never?<eos> Never.<eos> Are you going to tell me about the drycleaner's wife or are you intentionally leaving that out?<eos> Uh... I'm not sure what your mother told you.
Have you ever been unfaithful in your marriage?<eos> It's a standard intake question I have to ask.<eos> Hmm. Um, the answer's no.<eos> Never?<eos> Never.<eos> Are you going to tell me about the drycleaner's wife or are you intentionally leaving that out?<eos> Uh... I'm not sure what your mother told you.<eos> She told me that you slept with this woman for years.<eos> Well, that was... that was a long time ago.<eos> And that she confronted you about it, but you continued to see her.
How is she?<eos> She's... she's tired.<eos> Some cramping.<eos> Otherwise, I think she's gonna be okay.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't know who else to ask.<eos> No, no, I'm... You did the right thing.<eos> You can come to me with anything.<eos> You know that.<eos> I'm not gonna lecture you, try to talk you out of it.
No. No, that way that's how I love Virginia.<eos> So the good news is, you don't have to stay here because you're worried about me.<eos> I won't, then.<eos> Mom will really need my help if we're moving so far away.<eos> You know, John you don't have to feel so responsible for adults.<eos> Let them figure out their problems for themselves.<eos> You can just be a boy.<eos> No.<eos> I really can't.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.
There's just been a million details to attend to.<eos> I don't even rank as a last-minute detail?<eos> No, it's just been such a whirlwind is all.<eos> One minute, I'm sitting there in the mud, talking to Dr. Phillips, and then...<eos> God, why did I let you go to this concert?<eos> All that came from that debacle was VD, a field full of cows that won't milk, and you moving 2,000 miles away.<eos> To go to law school.<eos> I thought you would be proud of me.<eos> I am proud of you.<eos> I also love you, so I'm just wondering how we're gonna continue seeing each other.
The person I've known even longer than that.<eos> Wouldn't it be something if we ended up as friends?<eos> Dody, we already are.<eos> I haven't returned your calls because I wanted to speak to you in person.<eos> Lurking in the parking lot doesn't bode well.<eos> I'm hoping you can say something to make sense of all this.<eos> Well, you have to know you're the last person I wanted to hurt.<eos> Just me you're worried about?<eos> What about Art?<eos> What about the people who trusted you enough to hire you?
Alison Burke.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello. Can I see your form?<eos> ♪ bright guitar music ♪ Think that's it.<eos> Are we ready?<eos> Yeah! Let's go! Let's go!<eos> The future is happy and bright, my sweet boy.<eos> We'll see.<eos> I was about to leave.<eos> I am so sorry I've kept you waiting.
It's him.<eos> At some point, you just have to learn to let go.<eos> Amelia took that drink.<eos> It doesn't matter who offered it to her.<eos> She would tell you that herself.<eos> Riggs tried to talk your sister off that chopper.<eos> What?<eos> She needed to be with her patient.<eos> He tried to go. She wouldn't let him.<eos> - That's what he told you... t-that he...
I am furious.<eos> I feel like my skin is on fire!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm ranting.<eos> But I don't have anyone to talk to,<eos> - and I need to talk to someone.<eos> - No!<eos> And I've been treating you like crap...
Everyone does; that's why we named it<eos> "Nail Patrick Harris."<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You look like you're in a lot of pain.<eos> Do you want to roll the dice with one of the pills in the couch?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's not that bad.<eos> Okay, well lift up your foot.<eos> This is bad.<eos> I think we have to take you to Hapitalito.
It's hammer time!<eos> Well, that's the end of Nail Patrick Harris.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> With charisma like that, he's not going anywhere.<eos> I think we just got through our first fight.<eos> And only one of us had to go to the hospital, so I think that's pretty good.<eos> I think that is pretty good.<eos> You know what else I think?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.
I think that is pretty good.<eos> You know what else I think?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> I'll give you two some privacy.<eos> I'll be in my room.<eos> Even as a mime, you're still hot.<eos> While you were at work, I filled out your application for the liquor license.<eos> Randy, I love you too.
And now you're punishing me over and over because I dared to take things into my own hands because I recognized the spiral I was falling into, and I went and did something about it?<eos> I was putting you first.<eos> That's what you do in a marriage!<eos> Or I guess that's not what you do.<eos> I took care of myself so that I would survive!<eos> And all that does is make you angry.<eos> Look at you.<eos> What...<eos> What is it, Jackson?<eos> What... what pisses you off so much...
It's not just the harder thing sometimes.<eos> - Maybe sometimes it's healthier.<eos> - I'm not giving up on us.<eos> I won't. - You already did.<eos> - My God!<eos> - You take for granted that I'm just gonna wait for you, and wait and wait, no matter what!<eos> In fact, right now, it's a light at the end of a really dark tunnel.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Really? That's what this has been to you?<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry I kept you locked away in this prison camp!
It's one day.<eos> One prayer.<eos> Not like I'm asking you to go get baptized.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Their first real impression of me.<eos> What happens after at the holidays when I'm suddenly not praying?<eos> Well...<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You want this to go on for how long exactly?<eos> No, I just... I just want them to like you and accept us.
And, uh, what about the car he bought ya?<eos> Let's not go crazy.<eos> Hey, what's all that for?<eos> Well, Elliot and Yolanda are coming over tonight to watch the Mega Ball Lottery numbers being drawn, and I just bought our winning ticket.<eos> Oh, that's right!<eos> Hey, what time are we becoming millionaires?<eos> I, uh, might invite Conrad back with me to watch.<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> What if you win?<eos> Then you'll never know if he likes you for you of your money.
Thank you.<eos> Oh, my God, you had that ticket the whole time? !<eos> Why didn't you just go cash it? Why would you make me sit through this whole night with you with your gross come-ons and your sleazy innuendos and your fog of Euro-trash body spray?<eos> !<eos> Gabi, Gabi, Gabi.<eos> I did it for this.<eos> - For what? !<eos> - To watch you squirm.<eos> I liked you, Gabi.<eos> I liked you a lot and you threw it all away.
Hey, hey! No! You're not leaving with that ticket.<eos> Oh, you're gonna stop me?<eos> You and what army?<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Give us our ticket.<eos> Let me ask you something, buddy.<eos> Does this come in white?<eos> Everybody back off!<eos> There's no way any of you are getting this ticket.<eos> And there is no way I'd ever choke you out, wrap you in a shower curtain, and dump you in the East Bay.
Sure, but I may not be available.<eos> I have to swing by the hospital and have this baby.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Our boy's coming out.<eos> You're gonna be a daddy!<eos> Well, um, um... What-what... what do you want me to do?<eos> Breathe, baby.<eos> I'll meet you at the hospital.<eos> I love you.<eos> Aw, baby, I love you, too.
Fair enough.<eos> I'll put someone else on this.<eos> Per your request Murtaugh, starting tomorrow, both of you are reassigned.<eos> Good luck with your new partner.<eos> Maybe it was for the best.<eos> How's that?<eos> I mean, we would've made a terrible team.<eos> Hey, look, look. Nothing personal.<eos> I'm just at a place in my life where I don't want to be the cowboy anymore.<eos> Whatever gets you through the night.
Come on, we were both there.<eos> I saw you.<eos> You were scared.<eos> All right?<eos> You don't want to die.<eos> No, I don't want to die.<eos> Unlike you, who tries to accomplish that every second of the day.<eos> Understand I am not trying to judge you.<eos> All right?<eos> Something happened to you, man, and you snapped.
So who has the drugs?<eos> Hennicky had to know they were smuggling drugs down at the port.<eos> So he hires Alvarez and then he convinces him to steal them.<eos> So Hennicky kills Alvarez... - Mm-hmm. - ...makes it look like a suicide.<eos> Drug dealers think that Alvarez still has their stuff and the cops think he offed himself.<eos> Perfect crime.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> Go down there and talk to 'em.<eos> Tell 'em I want the kid back.<eos> Okay, then I'm going with you.
-Thank you.<eos> Here, let me...<eos> Don't forget this, Seth.<eos> Thank you, Seo-yeon.<eos> Bye.<eos> [Ga-in] What the hell was that?<eos> Is the kitchen going to clean itself tonight?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Hi there!<eos> I've got a lot to explain to you but I guess the first thing is... [woman laughing]
That's in dry storage.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Um, I mean...<eos> I'm new, so I'm just trying to learn the ropes.<eos> Let me know if you need help.<eos> I'll catch you up on everything.<eos> Hang on a sec.<eos> There you go.<eos> I know how it feels to be the new girl.<eos> I can see why he likes you so much.
Right now, it's an emergency.<eos> Okay.<eos> -We'll talk about this later.<eos> -Joon! -[Ga-in] Joon!<eos> -[Joon's mom] Come back!<eos> All part of the plan.<eos> Why did you tape over your car's logo?<eos> What logo?<eos> Didn't you say there was an emergency?<eos> Yeah, an emergency to get you away from Ga-in and your mother.
Like our wedding, for instance.<eos> I'm glad you brought that up--<eos> Something simple, I think.<eos> I want to ask you something.<eos> Not too simple, though.<eos> People will talk.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> You're not going to ask me if I love you or not?
Nice try, guys.<eos> But you can't just show up to my door and intimidate me like I'm some developing nation you can't control.<eos> That's right.<eos> I can't.<eos> But I-I think I know someone who can.<eos> Hello?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Mom?<eos> Brian, what is going on?<eos> You're suing the Secretary of State for violating you?
What do you mean?<eos> That guy breaks into your house, but doesn't take anything?<eos> Well, maybe he heard you coming.<eos> Or maybe he might have been here for me.<eos> You, why?<eos> Cops make enemies, and I have to find out if he's one of mine.<eos> That officer will be outside your door for the rest of the night.<eos> Lock your door.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll call you as soon as I can.
That's enough for now.<eos> So, I guess we didn't meet by accident.<eos> I really felt something for you, Zuri.<eos> - Hank...<eos> - You unlocked the door.<eos> - No, I-I-I didn't, I...<eos> You unlocked the door and you gave Tony my phone.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> They made me do it.<eos> Hank, I love you, but they threatened me, and my brother.
I mean, the-the only thing you're guilty of being is the stupidest man that I've ever met!<eos> Two strikes on your record, and you saw no harm in going around peddling narcotics?<eos> It was medicinal marijuana.<eos> That you're not authorized to sell, or have.<eos> And all of what you had is because you stole it off of a-a blind man!<eos> No, he's faking.<eos> Blind Frank can see just fine.<eos> Just when I thought my contempt for you couldn't be any stronger, I was wrong.<eos> Three strikes is real jail time.<eos> But I might be able to help you out.
Why are we following your cousin?<eos> Lee, we got no lead between our three houses.<eos> We looked at everyone with access to them and we still come up short.<eos> He's our best bet.<eos> - I don't trust him.<eos> - You can.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - You can try.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - I can hear you.
Previously on "The Americans"...<eos> Are you ready to move to get the codes?<eos> Yes. I am.<eos> You know it's possible for people like us who give everything to our country and the world to forget ourselves.<eos> I'm gonna miss her.<eos> Before we take the last step, I'll ask them to look for another way in.<eos> Do you want me to ask?<eos> Yes.<eos> None of my business anymore, but I can't stop thinking about you and Burov.<eos> It might be that you're holding off with Burov because your conscience is bothering you, because of what happened to Nina.
And Jimmy Sharp is your 2019 international motocross champion!<eos> Thanks for hanging out with me. Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Still can't believe Phil's gone.<eos> Gone with the wind.<eos> I'm just so sick of losing people.<eos> Yeah, we... go look for him on some... in days.<eos> It's just so hard to let go.<eos> Look, I hate to do this, Erica, but in the spirit of closure, I thought I should make you aware of something.<eos> Apparently, that guy who told you not to let me near your baby, well, he was a massive pornhead.
Did you tell Gail?<eos> Why would I tell Gail?<eos> I just, um... thought you two were close, but now that I think of it, you and I are closer, so yeah, this is normal.<eos> Well, I think we might get back together.<eos> I have diarrhea.<eos> Bye.<eos> Good-bye, Phil's crap!<eos> Good-bye, Phil's driver's license!<eos> Good-bye, Phil's watch!<eos> Good-bye to anything that's ever belonged to you, even your clothes!
You're late.<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> The basic homeschool curriculum can be completed in two days a week, but I've extended our course schedule with a few electives.<eos> Java, Banned Books, Subversives and Revolutionaries, Bow Hunting?<eos> You can take that one pass/fail.<eos> Seems like a lot.<eos> Well, are you interested in a life of variety and excitement?<eos> I'm interested in going to school two days a week and having the rest of the week to fuck off.<eos> Come on, you're straight, white, and rich.<eos> The world has lavished you with undeserved favor.
I just... you know, I want you to just have friends and... do all the stupid things you're supposed to do in high school.<eos> How was your party?<eos> Oh, it was... it was horrible.<eos> Your dad says hi.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He kept all our friends and they replaced me with this awful woman and her fake child, but he seems good.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Nah, that's me, replaceable.<eos> Alex hasn't replaced you.
You're exhausted.<eos> You're not too exhausted, right?<eos> - No. No. No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Ohh, it's Webber.<eos> It's Webber?<eos> Yeah, he's made me his guy now, which apparently means relentless pages and endless scut.<eos> Webber has singled you out?
Well, if you recall, I once ran a kid's camp, El campo del Sid.<eos> Disaster.<eos> And then I nurtured three beautiful dinosaur eggs.<eos> Disaster.<eos> And then I thought, who has time to sit on their egg all day?<eos> Me! So, I'm opening a pre-hatched pre-school.<eos> Egg sitting.<eos> I sit on your egg.<eos> Future disaster.<eos> Wow. And not one single parent has entrusted their egg to you yet.
Peter cottontail?<eos> That is insulting to my species!<eos> I'm here for the new ship you owe me!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Oh, let me refresh your memory.<eos> Last time we met, you beat, outsmarted, and humiliated me.<eos> So the way I see it, you owe me a new ship.<eos> Beat it, bunny. I don't owe you bupkis.<eos> What is he doing?<eos> I think... He's attacking you?
Billy.<eos> He apologizes, by the way.<eos> But he's known me longer, so he could see...<eos> What I couldn't see myself.<eos> Which is?<eos> I'm still in love with you.<eos> Now you tell me?<eos> I'm sorry, I know, I know.<eos> I know, I...<eos> I've put you through hell, I know.
Rayna shot a stake through her rib cage,<eos> Matt.<eos> Listen to me, we were out.<eos> Three years, three years, no stabbings, no hostage swaps, no supernatural threat breathing down our neck, okay?<eos> We are getting married in a month.<eos> We have got kids that we need to take care of.<eos> Look, Caroline was bait.<eos> To draw Stefan out.<eos> That's all.<eos> What the hell happened to you, man?
You weren't afraid of dying.<eos> You were afraid that I was going to die for you.<eos> Yeah, of course I was.<eos> You were afraid that it wouldn't have been worth it.<eos> Me sacrificing myself for you.<eos> Because you don't love me the way I love you.<eos> And the guilt of that sacrifice would eat you alive.<eos> Valerie...<eos> The truth is...<eos> I've never loved anyone the way I love you.
OK?<eos> Yes, I've seen him before.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> He's the giant.<eos> I saw him with Justine in Marquiet.<eos> Listen, Jérémy, let's be clear.<eos> You've already had problems with kids, you like them, you like to draw them...<eos> We found dozens of drawings in your van.<eos> We know you knew Justine, you met her secretly.<eos> People recognized you.
Previously on "Faking It"...<eos> - You two are friends now? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Dylan is cheating on her.<eos> Some has to tell Karma.<eos> We're done.<eos> Everyone's talking about your video.<eos> At least I didn't abandon my best friend.<eos> You forced me to kiss you over and over again, and then you rejected me!
That's like saying, "The Titanic hit so not a big iceberg."<eos> What happened?<eos> What's past is past.<eos> There's no need to dwell.<eos> Especially with all this film prep that we have, so, let's get cracking.<eos> * Lips like fire *<eos> * They fill my dreams *<eos> * I'm your James Dean *<eos> One soy hazelnut double-shot latte, iced.<eos> So, what, did they hire you and the live music?
I'm fine.<eos> I'm just... freaked out.<eos> You're safe now, baby girl.<eos> He came out of nowhere.<eos> I didn't even see him until he was on me, and then he grabbed me, and I was just... I was so scared, I...<eos> But you fought.<eos> I think I killed him.<eos> Come here.<eos> They said they had to take swabs from my fingernails.<eos> No, they're just looking for the DNA on the guy who attacked you.
I can't help but worry about your judgment.<eos> Loretta... That you may end up on the wrong side of my autopsy table.<eos> Special Agent Hardy would like me to confirm that you're coming back to NCIS.<eos> Go ahead and confirm.<eos> Are you heading back?<eos> Who's ready to enter the wonderful world of vans?<eos> Sebastian Lund, forensic expert, and Patton Plame, computer specialist.<eos> Otherwise known as the Wonder Twins.<eos> I told you I'm not down with that Wonder Twins bit.<eos> And I told you that you don't choose your nickname, okay?
Two months?<eos> That's five of us walking out tonight.<eos> Tomorrow, it'll be six.<eos> I don't negotiate like this, so let me tell you how this is gonna go.<eos> I'm gonna tell you how this is gonna go.<eos> I'm not stepping one foot into Trauma One<eos> - unless you start...<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let's all just calm down.<eos> I'm not trying to hassle you.
There are 11... different shampoo bottles in the shower at home-- 11!<eos> What? !<eos> The bathroom is not that bad.<eos> There's 14 different types of conditioner bottles.<eos> There's two detanglers.<eos> I don't even know what the bottom of the shower looks like.<eos> Every time I step in there...<eos> Can you stop?<eos> ...I feel like Godzilla!<eos> This has never bothered you before.
I've convinced Pena I'm a Russian attaché.<eos> Why?<eos> Someone paid me a lot of money to do it.<eos> Pena needs new I.D. papers.<eos> I'm supposed to bring my boss, who has the connections to make the arrangements.<eos> New I.D. papers?<eos> So Pena doesn't want to go back to Cuba?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> He's not much for conversation.<eos> Who dragged you into this?
So Pena doesn't want to go back to Cuba?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> He's not much for conversation.<eos> Who dragged you into this?<eos> Arkady?<eos> No.<eos> No one drags me anywhere.<eos> Someone offered me a paying gig, and I accepted.<eos> Arkady has nothing to do with this.<eos> Uh-huh. So, that wasn't his car we found you in?
Well, see, once everything was on the table,<eos> Cuba was open to changing their prisoner request.<eos> So the exchange for Officer Seymour is still gonna go down at midnight.<eos> That's great.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> Good night, Granger.<eos> Good night, fellas.<eos> Good night.<eos> What?<eos> I think I finally figured you out.
It's a heartfelt moment that you'll cherish for the rest of your life.<eos> Think I'd use that to point out a character flaw?<eos> Character flaw?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I don't.<eos> Oh, Anna. Here it comes.<eos> You called her?<eos> We're not gonna talk about this.<eos> I introduce you to a nice girl from a good family.
That usually helps.<eos> You know that someone sent you those photos for a reason, right?<eos> Your sister's death wasn't just about Edward Lamb.<eos> For whatever it's worth, I... I still believe.<eos> That means a lot.<eos> Uh, yeah, you know, it's, uh... it ain't no thing.<eos> Dude, what the hell is going on?<eos> I don't know, man-- all I did was put it online.<eos> Something's funky.<eos> Yeah, well, it ain't just Brody kissing you.
There's an inn in London...<eos> The Anchor...<eos> I'll meet you both there in two days.<eos> Wha... two days?<eos> Why can't you leave now?<eos> This marriage... it's been a challenge like no other.<eos> I feel like I was a child before I knew you.<eos> I was able to judge you and the things you did because I never understood the darkest truths of this world.<eos> I don't want you to dwell in darkness.<eos> I want to protect you from it.
As-salaam alaikum.<eos> Wa alaikum salaam.<eos> Nice, isn't it?<eos> Sharp, anyway.<eos> A gift from Jibral Disah.<eos> You've done your homework.<eos> I like that.<eos> Yeah, the caliph in Libya sent it when we pledged our allegiance after his glorious attack on America.<eos> Surprised they sent you.
What's your answer?<eos> I like a practical gift.<eos> How about I send you back with this one's head in a bag?<eos> What'd you think of that for an answer?<eos> I think such an answer would be beneath the dignity of an emir like yourself.<eos> You're a clever one, aren't you?<eos> Where you from, anyway?<eos> New York... but my parents are from Abuja, like yours.<eos> (laughs)<eos> That's why they sent you, 'cause we're both Hausa.
Yeah, uh, he did, and a-apparently you bought him some boots?<eos> Well, after Blake texted him the link, I went on the company's site, you know, just to make sure they still had<eos> - his size and stuff.<eos> - What?<eos> You know his size?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Blake's really good at eyeballing that kind of thing.<eos> So, they had this one-click purchase button, I was just like, bam,<eos> - right in the corner...<eos> - Ew, Mom, I just have to stop you and tell you that this is weird.
You know, on Game of Thrones,<eos> Balon Greyjoy received his son's genitals in a box.<eos> Well, never hurts to have a spare.<eos> What is that?<eos> Wow. It's an antique sextant.<eos> Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.<eos> What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.<eos> I know, she's so thoughtful.<eos> See, she's trying to get you back.<eos> Now, that is exactly what I would've gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.
All right, if you're gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don't know if I want to talk to you.<eos> Okay. I get it.<eos> And it's sweet that you're worried about me, but I can take care of myself.<eos> I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about me.<eos> I don't want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.<eos> Here we go with the ironclad logic again.<eos> You've tried to work with him before.<eos> It hasn't gone well.<eos> Why is this time gonna be any different?<eos> Is the fetus helping you?
By your standards.<eos> Shit!<eos> We have so many people to thank.<eos> Our beautiful bridesmaids.<eos> But, of course, my most heartfelt thanks, my warmest thanks, are to someone who's my best friend,<eos> my lover and now, I'm honoured to say, my wife.<eos> Naomi!<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Naomi!<eos> I love you so much, darl.
That's why they all left.<eos> They knew this was coming, and they got out so they could all have it on record that they were gone before the suit came down.<eos> Then we need to know who the hell tipped them off.<eos> It doesn't matter who tipped them off.<eos> What matters is, if we lose this suit, we can't handle the money.<eos> How much are they suing us for?<eos> - $100 million.<eos> - God damn it.<eos> We need to get those partners back.<eos> I told you, we're never gonna get them back.
What's your name?<eos> Mike.<eos> Mike Ross.<eos> Frank Gallo.<eos> Well, Mike, looks like we're gonna be sharing this little condo for a while, huh?<eos> Feel like telling me what you're in for?<eos> I get it.<eos> You don't know if you can trust me.<eos> Listen, truth is, you shouldn't trust anybody in here.<eos> Except I just asked what you did, and they obviously already caught you, so what's the harm?
- Harvey, I'm telling you.<eos> - Two...<eos> - Harvey!<eos> - Three.<eos> Did you pull your back out?<eos> Give me the goddamn thing.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> That's the thing about computers.<eos> You can delete whatever you want, but it's never really gone.<eos> So, if you had just stopped one trade sooner, they might never have even caught you.
It's for you.<eos> It's Jim Reynolds.<eos> That's Decker Pharmaceutical.<eos> Don't take it.<eos> He's leaving us.<eos> Louis, he's my oldest client.<eos> I'm not ducking his call.<eos> - Jessica.<eos> - Put him on speaker.<eos> Jim, how can I help you?
What is it?<eos> I just got a text from Mike.<eos> What does it say?<eos> It says that he's settling in and that he's getting along well with his roommate... And that he thinks he's gonna be okay.<eos> Maybe he's gonna be okay, but his roommate's in for trouble.<eos> To trouble.<eos> To trouble.<eos> Hey.<eos> What?<eos> She texted you back.
That's a little extreme, isn't it?<eos> Effectively, you cease to exist.<eos> As do we all... eventually.<eos> By refusing to cooperate, you're disobeying a direct order from a human superior.<eos> My loyalty is to my crew.<eos> I take my orders from them.<eos> Over to you.<eos> Android, I understand what you're trying to do.<eos> But it's pointless.<eos> I'm ordering you to cooperate with the investigation.
Off-duty, tech support, kitchen staff.<eos> I want everyone out there now!<eos> Everyone!<eos> But send one armed guard to my office.<eos> Ryo!<eos> Don't run from me, coward.<eos> Sorry, but we're kind of in a rush.<eos> Go.<eos> - Whoa. - What the hell?<eos> - What took you so long? - He's on our side.
- He was. The crew of the "Raza" escaped last night.<eos> And our asset?<eos> - Onboard the ship with them.<eos> - Now let's go get them.<eos> No! No!<eos> I got her.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> What are you doing on our ship?<eos> _<eos> Those nanites of yours, do they keep you from getting drunk too?
Where the hell did she go?<eos> - Okay, that's far enough.<eos> - Oh, my God, you're all right.<eos> - Don't move.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> You took the words right out of my mouth.<eos> I was looking for you.<eos> Something happened.<eos> You collapsed.<eos> I didn't want Devon to take you to the infirmary.
- You lost your memory again.<eos> My memory is fine.<eos> I remember what I had for lunch yesterday.<eos> What I don't remember is some little green-haired girl sitting at the table ever.<eos> This doesn't make any sense.<eos> You are trying my patience.<eos> But you woke up on the floor of your room, right?<eos> Doesn't that seem a little bit odd?<eos> Maybe we partied a little too hard last night.<eos> No, your nanites would protect you from that.
The fastest, most efficient way to do that is with a link.<eos> Maybe, but you know what could happen if you maintain it for too long.<eos> I can handle it.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't think it's worth the risk.<eos> Are you trying to test me?<eos> Because I'll show you what I can do soon enough.<eos> If she gets full control, she'll be able to supersede all manual input.<eos> Then we have to get to the bridge and cut the link before that happens.<eos> How do you suppose that we do that?<eos> - What took you so long?
Use her memories against her.<eos> Find one where she was at her most vulnerable, where she was afraid and alone.<eos> Yeah, I'm not sure she has moments like that.<eos> Everyone has moments like that, but you need to hurry.<eos> If she links with the computer for too long, she will lose herself completely.<eos> Come on.<eos> Almost got it.<eos> What is this?<eos> You recognize this place?<eos> Something bad happened to you here.
It's the fear, and this moment for you, it's so powerful that it robs you of all your strength, all your will.<eos> I'm done playing the frightened little girl.<eos> Let's see how you like it for a change.<eos> You have to finish her.<eos> You have to show no mercy.<eos> No.<eos> No, not like this.<eos> I know what happened to you.<eos> They treated you like a slave.<eos> And when you escaped, they hunted you like an animal.
Where to start?<eos> Uh, I mean, designing my own curriculum and, uh, just getting to be around people who care about what they're doing.<eos> I've never really had that opportunity, so it's... it's very exciting.<eos> Is that why you left Cedar Ridge?<eos> I needed a change so I could focus on my interests.<eos> And what are your interests?<eos> She's on the... she's on the soccer team and, uh, photography.<eos> Really, anything having to do with a camera.<eos> I just mean that she, uh, has such a good eye and really loves art.<eos> What is it about art that inspires you?
You changed my life.<eos> And I am a better person now because of you, and I don't want to imagine us anything but together.<eos> I...<eos> I love you.<eos> Nothing?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I...<eos> I've been waiting to say this for so long.<eos> I...<eos> I love you, too.
Aggressively detailed.<eos> I had to guess on the testicles, 'cause he hadn't described 'em.<eos> You know what it is?<eos> It's just that there's no turning back.<eos> I mean, who am I when I leave this apartment?<eos> "Mrs. Cece Schmidt?"<eos> "Cece Schmidt" sounds like the mayor of an evil Swiss town.<eos> It does.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did I tell you that Schmidt thinks that we should drop our last names and make up a new one?
- What the hell?<eos> - What?<eos> I'm gone for two months, and all of a sudden<eos> Winston's a bridesmaid?<eos> Never mind.<eos> - You need to call Schmidt.<eos> - No.<eos> No, I can't call him and tell him that I'm scared.<eos> I think that that's what getting married is.<eos> Sharing all this, all the things you're afraid of, all the things that embarrass you, weak doggy-style guy.
Don't... Get back in there.<eos> It's fine, it's fine. I'm...<eos> I'm... I'm thinking.<eos> Okay, I just need to think. - You want space. - Yes!<eos> I get it.<eos> I keep asking for space.<eos> People keep not giving it to me, bugging me about hot doctors asking for my number.<eos> And I keep shutting them down because...<eos> Why are we talking about this? Because it's not always the worst thing when people push you.<eos> When people push you, they're trying to help you.
It's fine, it's fine. I'm...<eos> I'm...

But... sorry... you have no clue about our team, okay?<eos> So...<eos> I mean, who the hell does she think she is anyway?<eos> Cheer captain.<eos> Promoted as a sophomore for a triple-year reign because I was just that good.<eos> Led my team to victory after victory...<eos> Regionals, Nationals, Internationals... three years in a row. Yeah.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> So let me break this down for you.<eos> You are jealous of her because she and Maxine are close now, so you got all butt hurt, but they aren't actually trying to leave you out.
Hi!<eos> Dr. Robbins?<eos> You ready to meet your son? Yeah.<eos> Here we go, hon.<eos> There he is.<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> Oh, he's so beautiful! Hi!<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> - ♪ rest your head ♪ - You paged?<eos> Um, Robbins has requested you for her service for the foreseeable future.
How long has it been?<eos> - The parents of this... - Yeah.<eos> They were just completely...<eos> So, um... what sort of work do you do?<eos> - Botany. - Oh. Wow.<eos> That's so interesting.<eos> Do you work outdoors all the time?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> It's such an unorthodox job, botany.<eos> What attracted you to it?
Not really.<eos> So, like, another time then, maybe?<eos> See, the problem is, if I give you my number, you're not gonna ask me out.<eos> You're just gonna send me, like, a bunch of weird messages, uh, you're gonna try to get me to come over to your apartment.<eos> - Probably for sex.<eos> - Oh, definitely.<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, and then I'm gonna stop responding.<eos> And then you're gonna go all aggro and you're gonna say that it was me that led you on and that you were just being a gentleman.
The uterine arteries are clamped, but there's still blood everywhere.<eos> She's not clotting. She's in D.I.C.<eos> Order eight more units of blood and FFP.<eos> Well, how's she doing?<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Bailey, where's Warren?<eos> I want to talk to him.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Well, that's what I want to know.<eos> Grey handed this patient off to you in the E.R.
Mm-hmm. You're a good person 'cause I say mean things all the time and you just smile.<eos> You're nice.<eos> So nice 'cause you do things for people, and I don't.<eos> Sometimes I need a fork, and you get it for me.<eos> And that's why you're gonna succeed in life... 'cause you get people forks.<eos> When you say you need a fork, I just say, "Why?<eos> You can eat out of your dog bowl."<eos> Who does that?<eos> I mean, I'm a jerk.<eos> You're nice, and I love you.
Visitors, visitors, visit...<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> and you just smile.<eos> You're nice.<eos> So nice.<eos> No, I think it's after this.<eos> No, no, no, wait, go back.<eos> - What was what? - What?<eos> That thing Axl said.<eos> Oh, that's when he was telling you how much he loves you.
Oh, that's when he was telling you how much he loves you.<eos> You don't remember? - No.<eos> - That never happened.<eos> It didn't even sound like me.<eos> 'Cause you do things for people and I don't.<eos> Sometimes I need a fork, and you get it for me.<eos> You taped me without telling... Illegal.<eos> Entrapment... turn it off.<eos> - No!<eos> - You're nice, and I love you. Ah!
He's really charming.<eos> - Prince Charming. - Prince...<eos> Phillip...<eos> Prince Phillip.<eos> Okay, that's fine. You charm her, okay?<eos> The important thing is that this ends today 'cause we don't want her coming back, not ever.<eos> Not ever... wait a minute.<eos> You want to kill her?<eos> No, Rusty.<eos> What I'm saying is you used to be married to her, so try to take advantage of whatever creepy spark attracted you in the first place.
I'm done messing around.<eos> I'm gonna lay it on the line.<eos> Marlene, let's talk.<eos> There's nothing to talk about.<eos> It's my company.<eos> Yeah, look.<eos> We put a lot of work, not to mention money into starting that business.<eos> And could you not do that maybe?<eos> 'Cause I want to talk to Marlene.<eos> If you don't get more fun, I'm not gonna take you home to meet my son.
Regina. Emma, please.<eos> I've already had enough people feeling sorry for me today.<eos> I know.<eos> I just think we should talk somewhere quiet.<eos> It's kind of delicate.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Hook.<eos> What the bloody hell's the pirate doing here?<eos> We thought we left you in the Underworld.
Oh, God.<eos> Andre, baby?<eos> Here are Rhonda's things.<eos> You know we're gonna take good care of you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Look, there's a chapel in the hospital.<eos> We can go pray.<eos> I'll call Reverend Pryce.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Dre, it may help you.
Can I touch her?<eos> You got it, you got it.<eos> Push.<eos> Push, push baby, that's it.<eos> That's it, that's it.<eos> All right, breathe.<eos> Speaking of push, you see the cops out the window right now?<eos> Nobody pushed Rhonda.<eos> She jumped, you tried to stop her.<eos> She overpowered you, tried to take you with her.
You got it, you got it.<eos> Push.<eos> Push, push baby, that's it.<eos> That's it, that's it.<eos> All right, breathe.<eos> Speaking of push, you see the cops out the window right now?<eos> Nobody pushed Rhonda.<eos> She jumped, you tried to stop her.<eos> She overpowered you, tried to take you with her.<eos> Grabbed you by the throat, which is what's going to happen, if you don't go with the story.
Y'all know I'm relaunching Swiftstream under a brand new banner called Empire XStream?<eos> And I want to make an offer for exclusive rights to your music.<eos> 'Cause I know how to get a brother paid.<eos> Is that right?<eos> My pipeline brings the revenue directly from the subscriber right to your pocket.<eos> No middle man.<eos> I mean, what do we look like, selling our catalogs to you? For your streaming service, when Empire's falling to the bottom of the ocean, man?<eos> Ain't nothing happening.<eos> Your stock down...<eos> Everything about you is going to the bottom of the ocean.
She needs a record deal.<eos> She's the truth.<eos> I'm not gonna tell you again.<eos> Oh, you can't tell me nothing, Lucious.<eos> See, you been stunting on me since we's little.<eos> Now I'm getting mines.<eos> Or should I call Tariq?<eos> See, I never stunted on you, man.<eos> Just talent, it excels, when mediocrity it stalls.<eos> God left you behind, not me.
Is that right?<eos> You remember me, Andre?<eos> From when you was a shorty?<eos> Yeah, I remember you.<eos> Your pappy raised you to be the perfect little henchman.<eos> Now you're a henchman with an Ivy League education.<eos> What a waste of a good mind.<eos> What's the matter with you, young bull?<eos> - Huh? Yeah. - You talking to me?<eos> He kicked you in your nuts over and over again.
Now you're a henchman with an Ivy League education.<eos> What a waste of a good mind.<eos> What's the matter with you, young bull?<eos> - Huh? Yeah. - You talking to me?<eos> He kicked you in your nuts over and over again.<eos> Messed with your love life, took over your wedding.<eos> He even stole your baby.<eos> Here you are, sitting at his table.<eos> - My turn now? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Let me help you out real quick. - Mm.
What can I do for you?<eos> OK.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> Karen.<eos> Good to meet you.<eos> You look... fantastic.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You made me go against Sylvie.<eos> I asked you to answer a question as Head of Legal Affairs.
They push the skin and the muscle aside and remove a piece of the skull to relieve the pressure.<eos> That doesn't sound so simple.<eos> I promise you, I will be up and walking around by this evening.<eos> Hello, everyone.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi, Hope.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I told you, you didn't have to come.<eos> Well, I couldn't stay away.<eos> Plus, I wanted to speak with your surgeon before he put you under.
The girlfriend's case is not admissible.<eos> Unfortunately, the D.A.'s decided we have enough evidence to charge Clair with murder.<eos> No.<eos> We've been ordered to bring her in.<eos> - Come on, Frank. - Yeah.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'll do it. I'll do it.<eos> - Go with her. - ‭Yeah.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The D.A. has decided to charge you.
How awesome is it that I get to work at the new, fancy Soul Spin that just opened up across the street?<eos> Now I get free lattes all day long.<eos> Oh, wow, they have free lattes there?<eos> Nope.<eos> Here, hit me!<eos> I'm sorry, I'm a little busy doing my real job... getting ready to tell Josh I am no longer dating.<eos> I'm officially waiting for him.<eos> What?<eos> Gabi, that's a horrible idea.<eos> He's the one that told you to start dating.
Okay, gotta go.<eos> - Josh. - Hi, Dr. Rounds.<eos> Honestly, I didn't know if you were gonna show up for your session today.<eos> Yeah, neither did I. Ah, my friend told me not to, but I felt like we were making some real progress before...<eos> "the whole thing with the dog happened."<eos> How is he, by the way?<eos> He's doing okay, thanks.<eos> Josh, I just want to say what happened the other night was unprofessional and will never happen again.<eos> Great, because there is a lot going on in Joshland.<eos> Well, I'm committed to helping you in the most ethical, objective, and professional way.
Aww, that's so sweet.<eos> Okay, my turn.<eos> So you were totally right about Josh.<eos> I told him I was waiting and he freaked out, so I told him I was waiting for a date.<eos> - And guess what I don't have?<eos> A date. - Oh.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> - Hey, Josh.<eos> Flowers, you ask? Indeed they are.<eos> Sent to me by none other than that guy I told you I was... dating.
I know.<eos> My Nana used to do this every time I had to do something sporty.<eos> Josh, listen to me.<eos> This trip to Australia couldn't come at a better time.<eos> You need to get away, clear your head, and come back and find yourself a new therapist.<eos> Might I suggest a man? No.<eos> I'm not seeing any more therapists.<eos> I am officially done with therapy.<eos> That worked fast!<eos> Oh, my God, what took you so long?
Too good to spill.<eos> Okay, well, I'll just be... goin'.<eos> Headin' to the door to... leave, unless you... wanna say something.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, I'm... leaving.<eos> Leaving.<eos> Left.<eos> You know what I thought would be nice?<eos> A little dessert.<eos> So, I whipped you up an apple tarte Tatin.
I never walked away from you.<eos> Even after all the stuff you put me through. Me?<eos> What did I put you through?<eos> You dated Cooper when I asked you not to.<eos> You kissed your therapist.<eos> You stood me up on our first date and you flew to Switzerland.<eos> You kissed your therapist!<eos> You kissed my brother!<eos> You kissed your therapist!<eos> And after all those things, I forgave you.
I think. I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I mean, it would be better for Mateo to be close to his father.<eos> I'm sorry, I just don't feel comfortable with that.<eos> I know. I get it.<eos> I mean, there's always strings attached with money.<eos> Like, look at your dad and the wedding.<eos> He thinks because he's paying for it he can invite whoever he wants.<eos> What?<eos> Did he call you?
Like I said, we're family.<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> Michael's spying on Rafael!<eos> This could be bad.<eos> It wasn't that bad.<eos> There was a pigeon inside.<eos> There's exactly one half-functioning toilet for the entire rec room.<eos> Okay, some nice lighting, music, scented candles...<eos> There are no windows.<eos> Hotel living has really spoiled you.
Right, and that story better end with us getting back to our world.<eos> Henry, will you stop?<eos> Your moms told us to wait back in the library.<eos> They could be in trouble.<eos> And since when do you care what they say?<eos> You already ran away with me.<eos> You lied about the Dark Grail.<eos> Henry.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> And if you really think this is the best thing to do, I'll help you.
Help yourself to a drink, Ms. Swan.<eos> I think I'll pass.<eos> You knew.<eos> Of course I knew.<eos> You've changed, Regina.<eos> The loss of one man isn't gonna push you back over the edge.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> For better or worse, this is now who you are.<eos> Guilt-ridden and weak.<eos> I only let you in because I needed this.
No.<eos> You risked everything to save us.<eos> We had to do the same.<eos> To be clear, I was fine running.<eos> Now I'm going to kill you all.<eos> Leave it.<eos> It's of no use to us now.<eos> And we don't want to be here when he wakes up.<eos> Have you any idea what you've just done?<eos> Stopped you from hurting my moms and anybody else.
And I wouldn't trade that time for anything.<eos> But you're forgetting something.<eos> It was just the two of us.<eos> And now...<eos> And that's why I thought if I destroyed magic in Storybrooke that we could all be happy like you and I were.<eos> But because of what I did, we'll never even see half of our family again.<eos> That may not be true.<eos> Your mom is with Gold to try to find a way.<eos> Should we see if they had any luck?<eos> Why didn't you believe me when I told you I wanted to help you?
You made the world believe.<eos> Still battling against your better half, I see.<eos> And failing.<eos> So, you made it through that portal.<eos> I'm never one to miss an opportunity.<eos> Of course not.<eos> And now that you're finally here, Rumplestiltskin, you're going to help me win that battle.<eos> Because if you ever wish to see your wife or your child-to-be again, you'll do as I ask.<eos> The only deal I'm gonna make with you is the one where you return that box to me, and then, I suppose, you get to live.<eos> I can help you... wake Belle.
I'm sorry.<eos> Home sweet home.<eos> And in one piece.<eos> I have to go, Henry.<eos> My dad... I need to talk to him.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I'm sorry if I got you in trouble for missing everyone's trip back to Camelot.<eos> It's okay.<eos> There's something...<eos> something I haven't told you.
Previously on Grimm...<eos> Yeah, we got you on breaking and entering, assaulting an officer, drugs in the car.
How could Adalind do this to Nick?<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> There's not even a word to describe this.<eos> Sean Renard to take Andrew Dixon's place...<eos> I can't believe this is even happening.<eos> I can't imagine what must be going on in Nick's head right now.<eos> I can.<eos> Renard wanted me to join Black Claw.<eos> I'm sure he did.<eos> Having you on their side would be very advantageous.
Detective Burkhardt, what is your problem?<eos> My problem is a case being handled by Detectives Masters and Baribeau.<eos> They brought in my partner, Detective Griffin.<eos> Uh, that's too bad. But, I don't think your partner's here.<eos> You're right, Lieutenant, no Detective Griffin here.<eos> I feel real sorry for you, Detective Burkhardt.<eos> You must be very frustrated.<eos> What the hell's going on here?<eos> You're in the wrong place, Grimm.<eos> No one's gonna help you here.
- Who?<eos> - Tony.<eos> We still have him in custody.<eos> He stole Hank's cell phone so we know he was assigned to Hank.<eos> I'll get it out of him.<eos> But you can't kill him.<eos> He just has to believe you will.<eos> I don't think that's gonna be a problem.<eos> I want you to go in first.<eos> I want you to identify him as the guy who attacked you in this shop.
Where did they take him?<eos> Mmm. Don't know.<eos> How'd you hurt your hand, Tony?<eos> Tripped. Over a Hexenbiest?<eos> Pretty, blonde. About this tall.<eos> Bet you were feeling pretty tough at the time.<eos> Where did they take Hank, Tony?<eos> - Let me think. Uh...<eos> - Barbados.<eos> Is this the guy who hit you? Yeah.
There's only two?<eos> There's another one back here.<eos> She was already dead when I came through.<eos> I know her.<eos> That's my neighbor, Mrs. Miller.<eos> The witness?<eos> Yeah, they got to her.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> We got the same address from three different sources and there were only two people here guarding Hank.<eos> Yeah, you're still alive, why didn't they kill you?
There are gonna be some serious changes.<eos> You're good cops.<eos> You understand what's really happening here.<eos> I'm hoping we can work through our differences.<eos> Did he just say, "work through our differences"?<eos> I know a couple of ways we can do that.<eos> If anybody goes near Nick, call me.<eos> Yep. I'll wait up to hear from Nick, okay?<eos> You are drinking this tea, and I am putting you to bed. Because if it's a stomach bug, you need to sleep.<eos> And if you're not feeling better in the morning, I'm taking you to a doctor.
Probably not.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Tea's ready.<eos> Help a girl pick out her knife?<eos> First time I've seen you out of your robes.<eos> Well, not the first time.<eos> Laundry day finally come?<eos> Found it in D'avin's room while I was going through his stuff.<eos> If you really want to piss him off, I could hire you.
We're on a warrant!<eos> Hands up, weapons down!<eos> So you're here to save us or kill us?<eos> You're Tanya, right?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Depends on who's asking.<eos> I'm Dutch.<eos> And we're RAC Agents, answering your call for evac.<eos> We sent that call a week ago.<eos> What does the name Khlyen mean to you?
Depends on who's asking.<eos> I'm Dutch.<eos> And we're RAC Agents, answering your call for evac.<eos> We sent that call a week ago.<eos> What does the name Khlyen mean to you?<eos> He's a RAC officer; he's the one that cancelled your rescue.<eos> We want to know why.<eos> Tell me why I should trust you.<eos> Because you were doing your job.<eos> And the people who were supposed to be protecting you betrayed you.
I... wow, I'm really fucked up right now.<eos> I just thought the way you were present... you know what I'm saying, right?<eos> Okay. I see what you're saying, Spence.<eos> But I ain't giving up on it.<eos> I ain't gonna let you give up on it.<eos> Why don't you come to the office on Monday?<eos> Let's sit down, let's find a prime location.<eos> Let's build a beautiful hotel and we're gonna honor your mother who's still alive.<eos> - Appreciate it.<eos> - All right, I appreciate you.
What, you ain't gonna let me leave?<eos> I ain't afraid to fly commercial.<eos> Come on, you don't think we'd actually send off Ricky Jerret that way.<eos> Who's we?<eos> You feel the love now, Ricky?<eos> Oh, uh, absolutely, Coach Payton.<eos> I did not expect you.<eos> Hey, it's good to see you.<eos> Drew wanted to be here, too, but he's with the family down in New Zealand.<eos> - It's good having you. - I understand that.
Take care of yourself and that beautiful family of yours.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me ask you this. Why'd you take off on me?<eos> Man, your mama didn't want me around, boy.<eos> Come on, D, but I did.<eos> She didn't give me no choice.<eos> No, don't put that on her.<eos> You chose not to change, be there for us.<eos> Man, look, I was young, man.<eos> She raised you right.
I'll take her number. I'll take her number.<eos> I'm not taking his number, though.<eos> I got him already.<eos> You gonna share?<eos> You gonna share that fruity ass drink?<eos> Oh, come on, Chuck, man. I brought you here to break your funk, not to see you sink deeper into it.<eos> Yeah, Buffalo and New Orleans ain't calling me with no huge contract.<eos> - You got options, brother.<eos> - And so do you.<eos> Option number one is going over there and telling Siefert he's a piece of shit for cutting you like he did.
Oh, come on. Don't say that.<eos> No, man, like, everything I do turns to shit.<eos> Shakedowns, injuries, demonic, overgrown fucking poodle on the loose and shit.<eos> I can't do shit right.<eos> Well, you got Vern out of Crenshaw, right?<eos> Man, his talent did that.<eos> Yeah, but you kept him off the corner and in the classroom.<eos> How you know about it?<eos> Me and Nate text a lot.<eos> I mean, mostly about weed, but, you know, he speaks up for you is what I'm saying.
And you should have plenty more offers after the year you had.<eos> Oh, you've been following me?<eos> You were on my fantasy team.<eos> We talking football or daydreams?<eos> You helped me win my league.<eos> I'm glad I could do right by you for once.<eos> Look, it's not my place to say, but if you have to leave Miami, you should go someplace that's really right for you.<eos> Now, I don't know where that is, but I'm pretty sure it's not Buffalo.<eos> I hope you figure it out.<eos> It was good to see you, Bella.
You should go smaller. Transition from a power scheme to a zone.<eos> That's why you guys were at the bottom of the league in rushing last season.<eos> Coach Berg caught up in the romance of '72.<eos> Maybe you'd like to come back to the team.<eos> I just said go smaller, didn't I?<eos> I don't want you on the field, Charles. I want you to work for me here in the front office.<eos> Lend your expertise. Obviously you're not short on opinions, and when you let them fly, they do make sense.<eos> And I could use the help.<eos> How about it?<eos> Jason seems to think I could help you.
I see right through that bullshit.<eos> You skipped the combine because you didn't want them to see what I already see.<eos> Most guys.<eos> Well, what I see is I see a fossil clinging to his former glory by hitching his wagon to my star.<eos> 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.<eos> - You ain't gonna keep going?<eos> - You're up.<eos> Hey, if you want to make yourself easy to beat, that's your call, man.<eos> Wow, strong already.<eos> I might have misjudged you.
He's won three Super Bowls.<eos> Get yourself together and show some goddamn respect for a guy who has paved the way.<eos> You don't know dick about no lifestyle.<eos> I know Ricky gonna like New Orleans way more than he gonna like Buffalo.<eos> Everybody knows that. Even Bella said that.<eos> What the fuck he care what that girl said?<eos> You know he care what Bella said.<eos> Y'all still sitting in the same spot talking the same shit, huh?<eos> It's about the dollars there, Ricky.<eos> I mean, that's what they're offering you in Buffalo.
Well, I have two things I want to say in response to that.<eos> The first is just very briefly that<eos> Kym and I are professionals.<eos> We know that, you know, the script is probably going to have one or both of us insulting each other.<eos> And then I want to say I know you wanted, you know, whatever, keep it light, but... when we started, I had a lot of professional respect for Kym...<eos> - I just touched your boob. Sorry.<eos> - You did.<eos> So, that's gone!<eos> When we started, Kym and I had a lot of professional - respect for each other. - Mm-hmm.<eos> But now, two and a half years later, I want to say I love you.
He's in love!<eos> Yolanda is "bee'z kneez!"<eos> Yeah!<eos> She is totally "bee'z kneez."<eos> Good morning, beautiful people.<eos> You know who's starving?<eos> Me. You know why?<eos> Sex.<eos> You know how much?<eos> Tons. I love you too.
It's all right, Tess. I'm right here.<eos> - Blake, can you get that?<eos> - On it.<eos> Sir, Michael, you need to leave the room.<eos> We need room to work.<eos> Don't worry, baby.<eos> I'm not gonna leave you, okay?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you so much.
We got to get her up.<eos> Blake, when you're done there, we need to get her ready for transport.<eos> No, no, no. I can't leave her.<eos> Your daughter suffered severe injuries from the fall.<eos> We're doing everything we can.<eos> - Is that her?<eos> - Oh, my God. Tess.<eos> Another set of hands up in the OR?<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> I love you, Tess.

I mean, she's barely even dating him.<eos> It's...<eos> How are you?<eos> Um, uh, we made coffee, but we could make tea.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Where do we keep the stuff for the countertops?<eos> What? The blue stuff, you know, the... to clean the countertops that's safe for kids.<eos> Uh, used to be behind the paper towels.<eos> Uh, Meredith, what happened?<eos> How can we help you?
Yes, I was.<eos> I got everything we need.<eos> "Need"? Wha-<eos> What she knew, when she knew it, whom she spoke to, and when.<eos> I needed to confirm that she withheld information from you when she was signing those divorce papers... that she legally committed fraud, and she did.<eos> And now... we can go after her.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> Don't hesitate.<eos> You can't be scared of what's next.<eos> I'm so sorry if I... if I did something to hurt you.
I just heard you got Memphis fired?<eos> He was dead weight, ratings poison.<eos> A real Ray Donovan.<eos> I was looking out for ya.<eos> Look, you've been such a good friend to me, so, speaking as your good friend, I think your love of the limelight is clouding your judgment.<eos> Thank you for helping me realize - [crunch] - What an ingrate you are.<eos> Francine, you're hurting me!<eos> I get the viewers.<eos> - I make the news fun. - [crunch]<eos> And I do it all to help you!
I didn't even know my first name until--<eos> I don't care about your name.<eos> My brother died today.<eos> I understand.<eos> Karim was all I had.<eos> My parents abandoned us.<eos> Nadir...<eos> I get it.<eos> You gotta trust me on that, okay?<eos> Now, what do you say I bring someone in here that can safely take that vest off you?
About the boys being related?<eos> I mean, based on the photos, I'd put money on it.<eos> M.E. is sending DNA from the bomb blast to the FBI crime lab.<eos> The Zahavis also sent their son's DNA, and it's being processed now.<eos> And how long till we get the results?<eos> You don't have time to wait, Agent Callen.<eos> Proceed as if we're right on this, for your own sake.<eos> Nadir, I need you to listen to me.<eos> You were not abandoned.<eos> Your parents did not give you up.
Guys?<eos> Mr. Zahavi.<eos> Uh, guys, I don't know what happened.<eos> Nadir, I want you to meet your brother.<eos> His name is Tomar.<eos> You're my brother.<eos> And you are mine.<eos> It's true.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I promise you, we didn't abandon you.
Here you go.<eos> Step up on the blocks.<eos> That's not good.<eos> That's a second dead man's switch.<eos> It's sending a wireless signal to the phone that's monitoring his pulse.<eos> If it's removed or if something happens to him, causing his pulse to slow or stop, the bomb will go off.<eos> C-Can you still get it off?<eos> Yes.<eos> These men are the best in the world at this.<eos> Nadir, the men who put this vest on you, d-do you know where they live?
It's your belly?<eos> karaoke and...<eos> Oh.<eos> And what do I have here?<eos> Aw... (clears throat)<eos> "Roses are red, violets are blue,<eos> "your desk is a mess...<eos> "But."<eos> "but I don't care because you're worth it<eos> "and I'll try not to make fun of it ever again because I love you."
Baby steps, I guess.<eos> I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.<eos> I will always have the dent to remember it by.<eos> You did it.<eos> Do you feel okay?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> I do.<eos> Well, I'm proud of you.<eos> Oh. Thanks.<eos> I'm glad I told you about the storage unit.
If I touched it right now, my finger would probably go right through it.<eos> Not that I will.<eos> The important thing is just not to say anything to your mom about anything you may or may not have heard.<eos> Okay? We cool?<eos> I don't have anyone to play "Marco Polo" with.<eos> Marco...<eos> So, given the choice between an atomic wedgie and another round of "Jerk/Not a Jerk,"<eos> Brick chose the latter.<eos> Hey, sorry.<eos> Is this guy bugging you?
I'm not blaming you.<eos> It's just what kids do to get attention.<eos> They...<eos> They lie, start fires.<eos> Frankie, it... it's okay.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> Really?<eos> Look, people talk about each other.<eos> It's what we do.<eos> But the thing is, deep in your heart, I know you love me, and I love you, too.
No, just a few questions.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing working up here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's quieter.<eos> I missed you last night.<eos> Just... work.<eos> Well, what are you doing tonight?<eos> Look, Alicia...<eos> I like you. I like you a lot.
Seriously?<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> I don't want you to say anything. I want you to do what you did the other day.<eos> I want you...<eos> - She was...<eos> - Can you give us a minute?<eos> Please?<eos> Just to make sure we get...<eos> We'll move it out in the hallway here.<eos> I want to use you and I want you to use me.
I need to talk to you about my father.<eos> Eli?<eos> Okay, I'm listening.<eos> You only know him as the man who fell from grace at the Smithsonian, but he's actually much more powerful than that and much more dangerous.<eos> How so?<eos> I think he's secretly funding your super PAC, which means that, at some point, he's going to ask you for a favor.<eos> And, trust me, you do not want to do any favors for that man.<eos> Or what?<eos> He'll do me terrible harm?<eos> He's already reached out to you, hasn't he?
Crap in a bag that hangs from my chair.<eos> Yeah, because a piece of shrapnel from a terrorist attack you staged got lodged in your brain.<eos> You really have no idea, do you?<eos> I had a stroke because your friends paid a goon to jam a needle in my neck.<eos> I don't know why you think that's true.<eos> Because it is.<eos> Anyway, this is not an old grievance.<eos> This is a fresh frickin' wound, and I'm going to make them pay for it.<eos> This is not the way.<eos> I assure you, Andrew.
I get there's other business happening around here that's apparently above my pay grade, but getting Suarez to back Mellie is a minor miracle... and you don't look the least bit pleased.<eos> What is it?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm not looking for a therapist, Marcus.<eos> Jake, I need you to get me into the White House.<eos> Have you gathered the press?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> In a second, I'm gonna close the door, and you're going to yell at me and try to undo something that can not be undone.<eos> But I'm going to explain myself, and you're going to realize that I did not betray you.
In a second, I'm gonna close the door, and you're going to yell at me and try to undo something that can not be undone.<eos> But I'm going to explain myself, and you're going to realize that I did not betray you.<eos> I just... did my job.<eos> You again?<eos> What do you got?<eos> More money?<eos> I'm guessing Abby made you an offer.<eos> I wanted to give you a chance to change your mind, to do what's best for you.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> I'm sure it felt good, Abby convincing you that you could somehow rectify your terrible condition.
I don't know about this dress.<eos> What?<eos> You look great.<eos> Well, that's 'cause you're looking from up here.<eos> He's going to be looking from down here.<eos> So he doesn't get the benefit of all this well-engineered cleavage.<eos> So wait for the right moment, drop something, and bend over to pick it up.<eos> Oh, please. That is such a cheap move.<eos> You taught it to me.<eos> Yeah, well, I was trying to help you through Junior High.
And then... car accident.<eos> One day she was there, and then...<eos> What about you?<eos> You ever lose anyone you love?<eos> Mm. My husband and our two sons.<eos> That's -<eos> - That's how you do it, isn't it?<eos> Your B-plus story and your C-minus conviction.<eos> If you're gonna give me the widow trick, please give me something I haven't seen on American telly.<eos> Anyone ever tell you, you have a really thick accent for an American?
Manus, Heyward, Steiner,<eos> Springer, Garabedian, and Gordon.<eos> A van is waiting in the parking lot to take you to the airport.<eos> Go.<eos> Why am I out?<eos> You just said I matched my card to the correct recruit.<eos> Yeah, but another recruit got information from you to match their card back to you.<eos> Sorry, Springer.<eos> I did enjoy our little chat.<eos> Call you when I'm done here? Yeah?
- I can't do it anymore.<eos> - So, I would be doing you the favor?<eos> It'd be mutual.<eos> Wouldn't pay half the rent, tell you that. - 25%?<eos> - Hell, no.<eos> If you stay here, you pay the rent in full.<eos> Okay. I'll pay the rent.<eos> God, let me think about it first.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Dad would fall all over himself to take you to work every day.
You got a visitor.<eos> Thank you, Peanut.<eos> Hey.<eos> Been meaning to come by here. Oh, yeah?<eos> Needed some paper products, too, so...<eos> Well, we have a wide assortment.<eos> That's not really true. We have a cheap assortment.<eos> You want to go get a beer sometime? A beer?<eos> - I didn't mean to put you on the spot.<eos> Just, after seeing you the other night, I thought... might be fun or something.
I know you're working.<eos> You don't have to call me back.<eos> I'm about to turn in myself.<eos> Just, uh... had a really interesting day.<eos> And, uh...<eos> Well, I can tell you about it on, uh, on date night.<eos> Until then, old Teddy signing out.<eos> Uh, I love you.<eos> I'm just saying that so you know you're loved and, you know, in case you think you're not sometimes.<eos> I hope this didn't freak you out. Old Teddy.
I'm sorry, Chloe.<eos> I only bring it up because... it did eventually force me to talk to somebody, and that helped.<eos> Some.<eos> I guess what I am saying, Daniel, is that almost everybody at some point in their life has to deal with or figure out how not to deal with their stuff.<eos> You... you have a very unique variety of it, and I don't think you have the option of not dealing.<eos> Even with gelato now in my life?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Guess who.<eos> Hi, Rick.<eos> Uh, I'm so sorry. I completely forgot to text you before we left.
This dude's a nut.<eos> Now, come on. Put it back in y'all's pants now.<eos> That's his problem, actually.<eos> You know, you're a little bitch.<eos> - I'm a what? - Manny!<eos> - A bitch. - Manny!<eos> Daniel, be cool.<eos> Dude's mad I jerk off.<eos> Believe that?<eos> I asked you not to do that in front of me.
I-I wasn't.<eos> I really only have two places to go, and I was getting away from one of them.<eos> Well, thanks for the vote of confidence.<eos> Did something happen today?<eos> Or is it just Pre-Traumatic Mom Disorder?<eos> They so hoped I could be put back together.<eos> Who did?<eos> My family, sister, mom.<eos> But I don't really see that happening, Chloe, no matter the surgeons who attend me.<eos> What broke you?
I guess it does.<eos> Listen, Daniel.<eos> When I asked you to leave the house that night, I was pretty angry.<eos> Understandable, Ted.<eos> And, um, well... it's not always good to say things when you're...<eos> I'm not saying I didn't have the right to be angry, Daniel.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Anyway, uh... I hope things can be... you know...<eos> Ted, you don't owe me an explanation or an apology.<eos> I've always greatly admired you and, uh, still do.
Okay.<eos> Okay. Well, I hope you have a good chunk of time before your next crisis.<eos> I really do.<eos> Aren't you in a chronic crisis, Chloe, alliteration aside.<eos> Have a good night, Daniel.<eos> Because there's too much shit to dredge up. And I don't want to relive it.<eos> I don't... I don't think I can handle it.<eos> I can barely handle life now.<eos> Look, I know it must be terribly difficult to even contemplate facing the very real traumas that you endured.<eos> But I've thought about this a lot, and I think that there's something else that's stopping you.
And this bloke, he's a proper nasty bastard -- smacks her about, has her doing all sorts.<eos> Like sex things?<eos> Makes her go on cam sites, like.<eos> Keeps all the money to himself.<eos> So is she quite fit, then?<eos> Look, I just told you, she's a cam girl.<eos> She's going to be fit in that line of work.<eos> - Where'd you meet her? - She just came up to me in the street.<eos> Told me I had a unique essence.<eos> A model-quality girl came up to you in the street and said you had a unique essence? Yeah.
That's good.<eos> Four out of five.<eos> It hurts.<eos> It hurts like a bastard, I know that.<eos> It's fine to cry.<eos> Pain's pain. You don't ever flinch.<eos> And why's that?<eos> So they don't see fear.<eos> They'll use fear against you, won't they?<eos> If there was one gift I could give to you, it's the gift of not being afraid of no twat.
I do.<eos> I will.<eos> With all my heart.<eos> Jeremy, you can't just delegate Alpha.<eos> It's never been done in the past, but things change.<eos> And with you, they will change.<eos> The Pack will support you.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Everything in your life has led you to this.
Boss, she told Tony that her name was<eos> Leah Ramsey-- that's not her real name.<eos> 18 Leah Ramseys have Social Security numbers in the United States.<eos> Not one matches her age and description.<eos> Does she have a phone, DiNozzo?<eos> Look, she gave me her e-mail, which I threw away, because I never intended to see her again.<eos> Well, how did you contact her the first time?<eos> I met her at a bar.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> She approached you.
Seriously, is this some kind of weird metaphor for my current psychological state?<eos> Look, I don't understand half of what you're talking about right now, okay?<eos> And we don't have time for an existential crisis.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You are Very Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.<eos> You survived the pneumonic plague.<eos> You saved Gibbs from drowning.<eos> But you know what?<eos> More than anything... you're one of my best friends.<eos> All right, looks like we tracked down the girl that got you into this mess, so enough with the Oprah.
So I've been thinking, what if I bought out your half of the house?<eos> Why?<eos> Mae-yi and I are thinking ahead.<eos> To the future.<eos> Why didn't you say anything real?<eos> Look, you don't have to front.<eos> We just want to get to know you.<eos> Someone has a friend crush.<eos> She's just effortless.<eos> I'm sure she likes you too.
- Cupid loves blood.<eos> - Okay, then.<eos> Also heartache, shame, agony...<eos> Why would Cupid like that stuff?<eos> 'Cause if those things didn't exist, relationships would be easy and he'd be out of a job.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Mother.<eos> Daughter.<eos> I am so lucky to have you.
Maybe you can start by figuring out why you're wearing one guy's ring when you might have feelings for another. - Have you guys met?<eos> - No, I don't think we have.<eos> This is Detective Marco Furey.<eos> He is my new supervisor.<eos> Elliot Rollins was last seen in Baltimore.<eos> We deliberately pointed the police towards Philly.<eos> That's where the trail was supposed to end.<eos> Somebody knows what I did.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Aria, I called you last night after you went to Ezra's. Yeah.
What I'm confused about is how you're involved.<eos> Elliot Rollins is a fraud.<eos> And somehow, you knew his real identity before anyone else.<eos> The police are looking for anyone with information.<eos> I can give them your name or you can explain to me what the hell is going on.<eos> The truth?<eos> Charlotte was my friend.<eos> So, everything's working out well with you two?<eos> It certainly is.<eos> We have you to thank.
Ali loves a suck-up, always has.<eos> Archer can handle it.<eos> He knows everything about me.<eos> My family, my upbringing everything I've done.<eos> Everything.<eos> And he loves me.<eos> He wants me out of here as much as I do.<eos> Well, you're lucky.<eos> That kind of love is rare.<eos> I'm lucky to have you too.
You should tell Caleb that you and Jordan broke up.<eos> I haven't told anyone about this.<eos> I had a dream about you.<eos> When I was in that place with A.D.<eos> I was so tired and scared.<eos> I wanted to give up.<eos> And then suddenly, there you are.<eos> You were all smart and preppy and ready to hatch an escape plan.<eos> I really wish I could have been there, Hanna.<eos> I wish that I could have helped you.
Home.<eos> Why?<eos> Are the police still outside your house?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's going on, Hanna?<eos> We think A.D. is heading your way.<eos> He might even be there already.<eos> You mean Jenna and Sara.<eos> No, he, as in Elliot Rollins.<eos> The same guy who put a muzzle over you and fed you crazy pills.
And every time I answer it, a voice says,<eos> "I'm watching you, Tucker."<eos> And the scariest part is this thing wasn't even working!<eos> So... so she went through the trouble of signing us up, and choosing a carrier, and getting it turned on.<eos> - I mean, who has got that kind of time? ! - (Ringing continues)<eos> Hey, you know what you need?<eos> Someone to protect you.<eos> Someone who won't back down when trouble rears its ugly head.<eos> This is my moment, Tucker.<eos> Let me help you.
I'm not sad at all.<eos> Besides, the only thing<eos> Emma needs right now is a decent preschool.<eos> Oh, my God, I can totally help with that.<eos> I went to the best one in the city.<eos> They love me at Belcrest.<eos> I'll put in a good word for Ben if you convince him to let me spend one afternoon with Emma.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Come on, Riley.<eos> He listens to you.
Mary.<eos> I read your little blog post this morning.<eos> Oh? Well, there's nothing you can do about it now.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> - Watch me! - Whoa!<eos> Angela: Thank you for doing that.<eos> I know I don't deserve it.<eos> I just got so caught up in the moment, but I would never to anything to hurt Emma.<eos> I promise I'll make sure she gets into that school.<eos> Thanks, but I'd rather homeschool Emma in a bar than send her anywhere that produced you.
So I hope you understand, I'm gonna ask you two to take a step back from this one.<eos> Well, catch us up.<eos> Where have you guys been?<eos> In the woods, where the action is, looking for their burrow and saving your ass.<eos> What?<eos> Well, one of the reasons we've been holed up in the trees is because Jesse hates the town and everyone in it.<eos> Because they're ignorant and useless.<eos> They didn't believe me 27 years ago, they're not gonna start now.<eos> It's boneheaded not to be following leads in town.<eos> Hey, nobody's stopping you from talking to the whole box of crackers.
I need to know what's going on here, Kara.<eos> Does this have something to do with my dad?<eos> You dad's still in Asia, sweetheart.<eos> In Hong Kong?<eos> I'll explain everything at another time.<eos> Okay, ready.<eos> I've got my sat phone if you need me.<eos> Shh, sweetheart.<eos> It's okay. We got him.<eos> I'll call you as soon as I can.
Tom, what the hell is going on?<eos> I want you to ask for a court martial.<eos> You'll be my legal counsel.<eos> What?<eos> Meylan will have to empanel a court.<eos> He's not permitted to sit in judgment over a superior officer so I'll have to hand in my commission.<eos> You'll never win.<eos> He'll stack the court with his top people.<eos> Good. Let him.<eos> Tom, he could put you in front of a firing squad.
And, yes... We want this off school property.<eos> - You coming?<eos> - Hm? You do it.<eos> No, we should do it together.<eos> Our daughter's taking drugs.<eos> She's reacting to our breakup.<eos> - You told them?<eos> - Well, someone had to.<eos> - She's 13, Marcella.<eos> - She blames me, she listens to you.
- Who's he?<eos> - He was robbed and assaulted behind the pawn shop where we found those trophies. - By her.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - Yeah, that's her. - Certain?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you know who she is?<eos> - Never seen her before.<eos> - Never.<eos> No.<eos> But it says here that she followed you into the backyard.
What... what am I looking at here?<eos> Oh, acupuncture.<eos> Since we ruled you out... thank goll, you know, eliminated you as the problem, hooray...<eos> I decided I should really step up my game.<eos> And acupuncture's supposed to be great for fertility.<eos> Uh, aren't those needles a little big?<eos> Yes, they are thicker than traditional acupuncture needles, because they're actually pushpins.<eos> - Are you sure about this?<eos> - Hey, look, it's fine.<eos> I'm just sorry to put you through all this.
I warn you, I'm not one to be trifled with.<eos> That's enough for now, poor wee thing, but you're coming along.<eos> I'll heal you just as I promised.<eos> And who are you again?<eos> One who communes with the natural forces and channels them to help the less fortunate, such as yourself.<eos> Really?<eos> You're his mother.<eos> Uncle Crowley's mother.<eos> Uncle? He tried controlling me when I was a child.<eos> Did he send you to bring me back?
You had all of the power of heaven behind you.<eos> Couldn't even slow the bitch down.<eos> Well, no need to feel like abject losers.<eos> You learned a valuable lesson here.<eos> You need me.<eos> All right. Not giddy with awe.<eos> You... exploded Jofiel.<eos> Or did Jofiel explode himself?<eos> Just sayin'.<eos> God cast you out of heaven.
It has to happen in that order, otherwise there is no Lucifer, there's no Cage, there's no nothing.<eos> He's spent years marinating in hate against us! He has to go.<eos> Problem is, we may need him.<eos> He's been down this road with Amara before.<eos> He might be the only one powerful enough to use the Horn against her.<eos> He had me cleaning the floors with my tongue!<eos> He called me "puppy"!<eos> He made me beg! All right.<eos> Come on. Is this what this is about? Huh?<eos> The fact that he dissed you in front of a bunch of stupid demons?
Is it going to be all right?<eos> It's going to be all right! Oh, you bet!<eos> Dear friends, it is going to be all right.<eos> The world ended. Oh, Crowley. What are you doing here?<eos> Uh, say, who was born today? Is this the Winchesters' kitchen?<eos> Uh, nobody, Hugh. Sort of.<eos> This is UTV... I come here in my mind to pass the time.<eos> For some reason, it has excellent reception.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What has Lucifer done to you?
I won't.<eos> But call me, okay?<eos> I will.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hecouldn't bringhimselfto leave!<eos> It'ssoromantic!<eos> So, one of your friends is passed out on your porch.<eos> Oh. Notquiteas romantic.<eos> That's not my friend.<eos> It's my mom.<eos> Here, let me help you.

Oh... (sighs)<eos> I messed up, Ma.<eos> I really messed up.<eos> No...<eos> What the hell?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Yeah. (giggles)<eos> Oh, I'm still drunk.<eos> I know. (giggles)<eos> But can I say something? I love you so much.
You don't move forward, you die.<eos> Listen, you will die if you try taking on this Tobias Church by yourself.<eos> There's no more team, Quentin, and I can't trust anyone in the department.<eos> Then don't.<eos> Just trust these guys.<eos> Lieutenant Conahan.<eos> I trained him back in the day.<eos> The guy's so clean, he doesn't even double park, and he's vouched for each of these officers.<eos> To do what?<eos> To help you whatever way we can.
I mean, it's what we're supposed to do.<eos> We're a team.<eos> We're friends.<eos> - [inhales sharply] - [staccato pulsating] [overlapping, discordant sounds]<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm okay, I just...<eos> What was I...<eos> What was I just saying?<eos> What is going on with you?
Thank you, Jax.<eos> But the Nazis still have the nuke.<eos> What are we doing leaving New York?<eos> Because the Nazis still have a nuke, which we saw being loaded onto a U-boat.<eos> They're gonna hit New York from underwater.<eos> Yeah, I'm tracking the uranium signature recorded by Dr. Palmer's suit, but before we engage the Nazis<eos> I need you to make these modifications.<eos> Really?<eos> Is now the time for me to be playing mechanic?<eos> Look, I know that you consider the chores that I've been assigning you to be a waste of time, Jefferson, but believe me, they're more than just an exercise.
How did he die?<eos> He gave himself up for me.<eos> That sounds like John.<eos> And he was a Hunter?<eos> And he raised you and Sam to...<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> And you said we've met before, when you traveled through time.<eos> Twice.<eos> Your memory got wiped, so...<eos> And I saw you when I was a ghost... which I don't remember, either.
I possessed one once, but - - Pbht -- it didn't work out.<eos> A lot of feelings and urges and ugly snot crying about how Julie's with Craig Castle now, even though he's total bae, but she's, like, a busted bitch on ice.<eos> Hormones, dude.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Let's clean this up.<eos> Then we go meet the man.<eos> I know, darling.<eos> But mummy will be home soon.<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> I love you so, so much.
The company's building a cage for this entire moon.<eos> I can't just sit by and watch.<eos> Don't put faith in my family.<eos> I'm not.<eos> My faith's in you, Red.<eos> I wish I could be more help with whatever demons are haunting you.<eos> I'm starting to think my demons are haunting all of us.<eos> I don't think Khlyen's your enemy.<eos> I don't think you get a say in that.<eos> Brought you here to make you a Level VI.
Now...<eos> I'm linked with Jaqobis.<eos> He'll lead us to our destination.<eos> _<eos> Let's go meet the family.<eos> So you decided not to take my advice about staying safe in Spring Hill?<eos> Well, you know me and advice.<eos> Last Jakk, I was a psychotic asshole.<eos> Language.<eos> It's good to have you home, Pawts.
Let's go meet the family.<eos> So you decided not to take my advice about staying safe in Spring Hill?<eos> Well, you know me and advice.<eos> Last Jakk, I was a psychotic asshole.<eos> Language.<eos> It's good to have you home, Pawts.<eos> I'm glad you think so.<eos> What about the lady of the land?<eos> Can I see her?<eos> Why don't I help you with whatever you need?
Don't want you worrying too.<eos> Yeah, I'll just hold on to it for now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll go ready the prisoners.<eos> Okay, you don't like my singing.<eos> The only person who knows that song is Khlyen.<eos> He wrote it for me.<eos> So how is his song in your head?<eos> I told you, the last time I saw D'Avin, he was taking a swing at me.<eos> I told him, "You join the military, or I lock you up."
Yeah, exactly like that.<eos> Maybe Khlyen found a way to link your minds like he did to me with the neurolink.<eos> Not exactly VI material.<eos> Agreed.<eos> If we gave him any more, we'd kill him.<eos> Well, at least we know Jaqobis' immunity to the plasma doesn't come from his father.<eos> Maybe it's maternal.<eos> Well, let's see if he knows where his mother is.<eos> I need to link with D'Avin again.<eos> If he's using you to spy on us, maybe we could use you to spy back.
So blow this thing, set off a big chain reaction, burn the fog right out of the air, huh?<eos> Yeah, something like that.<eos> We let the fog finish out the fam inside, then we bolt, and then we split the joy 50-50.<eos> And I won't have to explain a dead Killjoy along with the Simms family popsicles inside.<eos> You really are a massive dick-hole.<eos> You know that?<eos> Careful, you might hurt my feelings.<eos> So what's it gonna be?<eos> She was giving me orders till the very end.<eos> Never even said, "I love you."
Fight! Fight!<eos> I've been thinking about starting to wear a watch again.<eos> Let me open the barn door and welcome Honesty.<eos> Hi, Honesty.<eos> Williamsburg, now, Honesty is here and has no agenda but to listen.<eos> Honesty, I ate the seaweed.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> And, Don, do you have anything to say to Honesty?<eos> Honesty, sorry for being so macho.<eos> I'm sorry I picked you last for touch basket.

Is he sorry?<eos> I think Nick's kind of still upset that Sam punched him in the throat.<eos> What?<eos> Sam... so tender and delicate...<eos> You haven't met Nick.<eos> He's just the most throat-punchable boy in all the world.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't even...<eos> Nick is a whatever, I don't even have to...<eos> Sam, do you need this Nick to apologize for wounding you?
Are you holding in a sneeze?<eos> God, where did it even go?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> How did I get sick?<eos> I was so careful.<eos> - You did the best you could.<eos> - I have no idea, man.<eos> - We're missing Poppycock.<eos> - You guys, I hate that Sam's out there mad at me.<eos> Because he's mad at you or because you still have feelings for him?
You know the rules.<eos> Last night was pushing it.<eos> It wants real evil, not these lightweight losers we've been feeding it.<eos> Yeah, you should get on that.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Which is more than you're doing.<eos> Hey, this is a really good book.<eos> How long is this bad-guy slaughter going to last?<eos> How many more bodies will it take before this is over?<eos> It can hear you.
That's strange.<eos> Maybe that means something?<eos> There was a news story about this area a couple months ago.<eos> Some locals cried miracle when a nearby creek ran red with blood.<eos> Turns out there's a slaughterhouse with a drainage issue nearby.<eos> They closed it down.<eos> How far from the crime scene?<eos> Exactly three miles.<eos> I'll go check it out.<eos> I'll call you back.
It has come for them.<eos> No, no, we are not playing this game.<eos> What is it? !<eos> What does it want with my children? !<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's your tongue.<eos> Don't do anything you might regret.<eos> Think about Elena.<eos> I'm trying to explain to you, Stefan,
One tunnel.<eos> I decide to go down one simple tunnel, and instead of being available for my kids who are under attack, I'm out of range.<eos> I mean, are we doing this all wrong?<eos> Should we just never leave their sides for the rest of their lives?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We don't know how to do it right, clearly, or someone wouldn't have tried to assassinate our nanny tonight.<eos> It's because we're divided.<eos> I live 30 minutes away in a crappy apartment.<eos> We share custody.<eos> I'm just too far away to help you out.
I could care less about the El Oso biopic.<eos> I told him he could direct it for all I cared.<eos> Wait, you... you told Zane he could star in and direct his dream project?<eos> Only I guess Zane had already promised the job to someone else...<eos> Someone who would not be happy to lose it.<eos> O, woe is me.<eos> T'have seen what I have seen...<eos> No.<eos> Y-You've got to feel it more.<eos> This isn't just some guy who broke up with you on Snapchat.
Someone who would not be happy to lose it.<eos> O, woe is me.<eos> T'have seen what I have seen...<eos> No.<eos> Y-You've got to feel it more.<eos> This isn't just some guy who broke up with you on Snapchat.<eos> Hamlet betrayed you.<eos> He... He never loved you.<eos> "Get thee to a nunnery," right?<eos> Hamlet took everything from you.
- Oh, Mother, new autograph. - Yeah.<eos> Nice.<eos> Conveys wisdom, insight.<eos> I like it.<eos> All right, I just need my car keys, and I'm off to the Manchester Energy building.<eos> Wait, murder at Manchester Energy?<eos> Who's the victim?<eos> All they said was "dead male."<eos> Ah.<eos> You know, Rick, I have never seen you in action at an NYPD crime scene.
What the hell is going on?<eos> Does this have anything to do with your client?<eos> Hayley, I'm sorry.<eos> I lied about everything.<eos> There is no cheating husband, nor an angry wife.<eos> What?<eos> How could you be so...<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Why?<eos> Who put you up to this?
When Marcus came back, both him and his laptop stunk like cigars,<eos> - and that's all I know.<eos> - Where's Marcus' laptop now?<eos> Okay, if there's still a copy of the worm program on here,<eos> I might be able to find out who created it.<eos> Hold on. To attack London's power grid, you didn't even need Hayley or Bryce.<eos> No.<eos> But that's the way Edgar told Marcus it had to be.<eos> I was chosen specifically.<eos> And your buddy Bryce was only leveraged to do this job to get to you.
You passed the test.<eos> This was all a loyalty test?<eos> It was the only way to know.<eos> I had to put a target on your back and make sure you wouldn't capitulate to the authorities, but you didn't.<eos> Wesley, you murdered people.<eos> You killed Bryce.<eos> You're damn right I did!<eos> He and Her Majesty's Kingdom abandoned me, so they had to be punished.<eos> Which is why you sent our worm to plunge London into darkness.<eos> Oh, Wes, your captors drove you mad.
Do you know why we were such effective spies?<eos> Because we lived for the rush of the mission.<eos> We were willing to die for that high.<eos> And we were wrong.<eos> After a lifetime of not letting anyone in, not even each other, I found people who tore down my walls.<eos> I found a family, and they're wonderful.<eos> So that's why I gave you such a kicking.<eos> You've went and got soft on me, Hayley.<eos> Wesley, don't do this.<eos> Let me help you.
Let me see your hands.<eos> Drop the knife.<eos> There's only one way this is going to end.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Either you die or I die.<eos> Wesley, don't make me do this.<eos> Come on, Hails.<eos> You killed me once already.<eos> Don't.<eos> I hated myself for leaving you.
You don't have to mourn your friends alone, you know?<eos> You don't have to do anything alone ever again.<eos> A red rose for the lady.<eos> You know, the French would say "je suis dιsolι."<eos> In Spanish, "lo siento."<eos> In Latin, "mea culpa."<eos> - Okay, you're apologizing.<eos> I get it.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Because I have been keeping something from you that your subconscious mind picked up on and caused you to have a dream that I betrayed you in some way.
Is if that person were a witch.<eos> Say Bonnie Bennett.<eos> 'Cause that would mean you just gave the girl you love a death sentence.<eos> I thought I was protecting you.<eos> I'm gonna die?<eos> I will not let you die, Bonnie Bennett.<eos> Bonnie, I...<eos> _<eos> What is going on?<eos> Alex told the Armory to bring you in.
No, my allegiance is to myself.<eos> Simpler that way.<eos> What you should want to know is why you're important to Alex.<eos> Now, in exchange for protection, plus complimentary room and board, you're gonna do some research for me, college girl.<eos> Sift through these and figure out why the Armory is so desperate to get their hands on you.<eos> Can Enzo not read?<eos> While I'm away, keeping up appearances with them, if you take one of these every day, you'll be safe.<eos> Hidden from locator spells.<eos> If I don't?<eos> I'm sure Alex has a cozy little cell waiting for you.
How you said she never wanted to discuss her siblings.<eos> But her sister Virginia's journal talks about how close they were.<eos> What else does Virginia say?<eos> Kind of off-balance.<eos> Seems to hate everything your family stands for.<eos> Well, at least she knows what that is.<eos> I'm still trying to figure it out.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> Hmm?<eos> They abandoned you.
I am sure that you did not come here so we could discuss our feelings.<eos> Your situation is untenable.<eos> You care for a girl that probably doesn't have long to live.<eos> I need that girl to perform a simple spell so I can put our family back together.<eos> I feel like you and I could solve each other's problems, Lorenzo.<eos> Bring me Bonnie Bennett, and I will do everything I can to save her life.<eos> Enzo's a big boy.<eos> He can take care of himself.<eos> I don't want to talk to you.<eos> Look, Bonnie, had Alex seen you, she would have called in her SWAT team and all this would have been for nothing.
Professor Saltzman.<eos> You're both gonna have to come with us.<eos> You came back.<eos> When have I not?<eos> Don't be sad.<eos> I have decided, I'm not gonna be sad.<eos> I'm not gonna think about all the things we never got the chance to do together.<eos> I'm gonna be happy.<eos> I'm gonna think about all the things we... we did do together.<eos> What, like all the excitement and adventure I provided you within the confines of these four walls?
Look, I really don't want to talk about Ashlynn or Wyatt.<eos> Well, I'm not talking about Wyatt and Ashlynn,<eos> I am just talking about partnership and commitment and loyalty and honesty and all those things that Stefan just took away from me.<eos> I understand, but there hasn't been any closure.<eos> I don't need closure.<eos> No, I do.<eos> I need closure.<eos> I don't know if you remember, but my last wedding didn't go so well.<eos> So if you think that there's a chance that you and Stefan, uh, might find your way back together again, I'd like to know before I pick out my tie.<eos> No, 'cause I want to marry you, and I want to be your loyal, honest, committed partner.
And if that's the way that it has to be, I want to be deep in it with you.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I can't say I'm gonna miss you, stabby-pants, but you are doing a grande solid for Bonnie.<eos> I figure that deserves a "thank you,"<eos> even in my own twisted book.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> All right.<eos> Bonfire, check.<eos> Last descendant of the tribe that created you... by the way, thank you for that... check.
I know.<eos> Believe me, I've been there. You think?<eos> I am in the exact same situation that you were in three years ago, and now that I finally understand how you felt, I'm even more furious with you, because I know what a huge decision you had to make, and you made it without me.<eos> Look.<eos> When I went to go find you in Dallas, here's what I saw... I saw you and Ric and the kids, and you were happy.<eos> You know what I didn't see?<eos> Me.<eos> So, I convinced myself that I was doing right by you, even though I had no idea what I was doing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And you have every right to hate me for what I did to you three years ago.
Me.<eos> So, I convinced myself that I was doing right by you, even though I had no idea what I was doing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And you have every right to hate me for what I did to you three years ago.<eos> And three hours ago.<eos> Just don't pretend that you wouldn't act any differently.<eos> You're doing the same thing with Bonnie right now.<eos> You can't accept a world where Bonnie dies.<eos> Even though that's a choice that she's trying to make for herself, and you know why?<eos> Because you love her too much, and there's nothing wrong with that, and I love you, and the thought of you getting hurt... it's not an option that I'm willing to entertain.
My grave.<eos> From Remembrance Day.<eos> A memorial to one of the many lives of Bonnie Bennett.<eos> What's that supposed to prove?<eos> That you're a survivor.<eos> That you will get through this.<eos> I'm not the one that needs to be worried about that.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You know why I brought you to this stupid stump?
You remember it? Huh?<eos> You died.<eos> We mourned you.<eos> And you came back.<eos> You've been so many things, Bonnie.<eos> A witch, a human, a ghost, a corpse.<eos> An anchor to the afterlife, and now, the woman who's gonna kill me.<eos> And every time, you come back stronger.<eos> Do you know how incredible that is, Bonnie?<eos> Do you know how much I envy you?
An anchor to the afterlife, and now, the woman who's gonna kill me.<eos> And every time, you come back stronger.<eos> Do you know how incredible that is, Bonnie?<eos> Do you know how much I envy you?<eos> Hell, some days I can't even handle just being myself.<eos> Stop... talking.<eos> I can't.<eos> Because if this is my last moment with you, Bonnie Bennett,<eos> I need you to hear me.<eos> I admire you.

Some visuals.<eos> But mostly, I can feel them.<eos> Their emotions.<eos> They're scared.<eos> And they should be.<eos> The urges are getting stronger.<eos> I can feel it taking over.<eos> I don't want to hurt them.<eos> Then untie me.<eos> Let me help you, okay?

He said he'd be here. Well, he was, until you called and told him to forget it.<eos> Except I didn't do that.<eos> Are you Damon Salvatore?<eos> Yes. Well, that's who called.<eos> You bring that pilot back before I rip your throat out.<eos> Spot of turbulence?<eos> More like interference.<eos> Salvatore Airlines, may I help you?<eos> You think you're clever?<eos> Considering the fact that I tracked down you, your pilot and your plan, all in a little bit of brotherly intuition, yes, Damon, as a matter of fact, I do.
I thought that my love for Caroline was so strong that I would do anything to protect it.<eos> But then I realized, that's not love, Damon.<eos> That's fear.<eos> You should put that on a greeting card.<eos> That night that you put yourself down, it wasn't because you loved Elena.<eos> It was because you were afraid if you didn't, you would do something terrible, and you would lose her forever.<eos> And that fear, that fear was so powerful that it overrode any love that you felt for me or Bonnie or anybody else.<eos> It wasn't about you, Stefan.<eos> Oh, it had absolutely everything to do with me.<eos> No. I looked you in the eyes, Damon, and I begged you to stay.
What are you doing?<eos> My part.<eos> I need a favor from you.<eos> I need you to think about me.<eos> No. All right, I'll pretend that doesn't hurt my feelings.<eos> Look, I know your urges are strong and you can't control them, but you can focus them.<eos> Chase me, and only me, and it'll give our friends some time to sort all this out.<eos> I'll catch you, Enzo.<eos> Come on, love.<eos> I'll lead you on a little, wild goose chase.
We've searched everywhere else.<eos> You know, if you're scared, Damon, you can go, uh, wait outside with the three-year-olds.<eos> You ready to do this or what?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> But I'm gonna do it alone.<eos> Like hell you are.<eos> Whatever's down there is nobueno.<eos> Which is why you need me.<eos> Let me do this, Stefan.<eos> There is a girl waiting outside for you, and if you go in there with me, and get all screwed up, you're gonna have problems with her, and you're gonna blame me.

How the hell did you get yourself into this one?<eos> I just can't escape this life.<eos> That's the thing, Matt.<eos> You haven't really tried.<eos> So what do you want to do?<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> Please take me with you.<eos> Sorry, Matt.<eos> You don't belong with me, either.<eos> There's a better life for you out there.
BENNETT:<eos> She's tired but awake.<eos> Come and see your daughter.<eos> I know she's gonna want to see you.<eos> (monitor beeping rhythmically)<eos> (laughs):<eos> My baby!<eos> You are so brave.<eos> And I am so proud of you.<eos> I love you, too.
- There are gonna be some serious changes.<eos> You're good cops.<eos> You understand what's really happening here.<eos> I'm hoping we can work through our differences.<eos> - Did he just say "work through our differences"?<eos> - I know a couple of ways we can do that.<eos> If anybody goes near Nick, call me.<eos> - Yeah. - I'll wait up to hear from Nick, okay?<eos> You are drinking this tea, and I am putting you to bed, because if it's a stomach bug, you need sleep.<eos> And if you're not feeling better in the morning, I'm taking you to a doctor.
The guy I worked for -- total badass!<eos> And yes, he could be a dick.<eos> Now, that guy... had some stories to tell.<eos> And he has a lot to answer for.<eos> Okay, so what do I do?<eos> Hold up a mirror and show us who you are.<eos> Warts and all.<eos> Write for an audience of one -- you.<eos> Dance like no one else is watching.<eos> I'm gonna help you either way.
You know, I was a crappy, terrible god.<eos> My work was pretty much a lame, half-assed rewrite of your greatest hits.<eos> But at least I was never a coward.<eos> There he is.<eos> That's the guy I know, the guy I love.<eos> I remember the first time I saw you.<eos> All the angels were terrified, but I wasn't.<eos> The feeling of your light was... was just beyond measure.<eos> And then the unthinkable.<eos> You picked me to help you with your tablets.
Um... I'm guessing you came back to help with the Darkness, and that's great.<eos> That's, you know -- It's fantastic.<eos> Um, but you've been gone a -- a... long, long time.<eos> And there's so much crap that has gone down on the Earth for thousands of years.<eos> I mean, plagues and wars, slaughters.<eos> And you were, I don't know, writing books, going to fan conventions.<eos> Were you even aware, o-or did you just tune it out?<eos> I was aware, Dean.<eos> But you did nothing.<eos> And, again, I-I'm not trying to piss you off.
Yeah, but I still don't understand how -- how dying is a -- a blueprint for success.<eos> I don't be dying. I'll be caged.<eos> I trade myself for...<eos> everything I created. It goes on.<eos> Okay, well, the, um, Amara that I know is... a mountain of -- of pissed off.<eos> I mean, she spent a -- a gazillion years in solitary.<eos> The only thing she's thinking is -- is it's her turn.<eos> And I'll give it to her, as long as she accepts the deal.<eos> The deal?<eos> She's gonna eliminate you, and then she's gonna destroy everything that you've created.
If we do get Lucifer for the added muscle, then...maybe he'll play ball.<eos> I thought they hated each other.<eos> Yeah, they do.<eos> I so miss being an atheist.<eos> All right, Metatron.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> Fine.<eos> Thanks for inviting me.<eos> Inviting you?
This guy's a prophet?<eos> He had no idea he was next in line after Kevin. How would he?<eos> He hadn't gotten hit by the God power yet.<eos> What about Amara?<eos> She's your sister.<eos> I took responsibility for her, too. Locked her away.<eos> So you're just gonna let Amara win?<eos> How is death by your sister a strategy?<eos> I know her.<eos> She's gonna eliminate you, and then she's gonna destroy everything that you've created.
I am sorry that you feel... that I betrayed you, that I acted without cause.<eos> I'm sorry that you can't see you gave me no choice.<eos> I'm good.<eos> You heard that, right?<eos> W-We all know that you are God, um, but... maybe could you be a-a little less...<eos> But I am -- I-I'm the Lord.<eos> There he goes.<eos> I did what I had to do.<eos> To create the world, I had to lock Amara away.<eos> And when the Mark corrupted you and I saw that you posed a threat to humankind, I did the same with you.
What would you have done?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You were my father, and you forsook me.<eos> I did.<eos> I was supposed to love all creation equally.<eos> I wasn't supposed to have favorites.<eos> But you... You were mine.<eos> I gave you the Mark because I loved you the most... because I thought you were strong enough to bear it.<eos> And when I saw that I was wrong... when I watched my choice... devour my... most cherished son...<eos> And so I punished you.
What do you got?<eos> So what do we bring to the table to make up for archangel power?<eos> We could try and find more Hands of God.<eos> A little redundant.<eos> Well, what about Crowley?<eos> Big demon power, former king of Hell. He was a player in his day.<eos> Stealing my moves, Dean?<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You got Lucifer back in the fold.<eos> He snapped you here.
And into darkness.<eos> Into nothing.<eos> When God's gone, the universe -- everything will cease to exist.<eos> Including me.<eos> And while law enforcement is telling people not to panic, residents are being advised to stay in their homes as authorities are baffled by this st--<eos> Boring.<eos> He looks horrible.<eos> My brother betrayed me.<eos> He locked me away for billions of years.<eos> He sent you to execute me.
I didn't say that.<eos> Commissioner, if-if I may.<eos> Please.<eos> Look, I know people thought I was crazy to stay on the job.<eos> But I actually did it for Mohammed Sadiq.<eos> I wanted to do the job right to honor his memory with my service.<eos> Well... that's admirable.<eos> But an awful lot of people that...<eos> It's just gonna go right over their heads.<eos> Including you.
And, Beau, since your back is fine and you don't need to go to the doctor, here's your beer.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> Go see a doctor.<eos> And fork over $200 for a co-pay?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> If it ain't feeling better next week, I'll go to the vet and get some pills.<eos> Rooster, will you pick up my beer?<eos> Yup. Jameson, you touch that beer, you'll never drink in this bar again.<eos> Sorry, Dad.<eos> I love you, but I love free beer more, so...
Two beers.<eos> That's cool.<eos> So, Kenny, how's things with you and Abby?<eos> They great? Because you guys make a really, really cute couple.<eos> Yeah. - She's the best!<eos> - Yeah. She just gets me.<eos> Yeah, that's great.<eos> Hey, you know what? I think Dad wants to get out of here.<eos> No, I don't think he does.<eos> Uh, so, you know, I know all the reasons why Abby loves you, but why don't you tell me and Colt all the reasons you love Abby.
She got 'em from me.<eos> So I hurdle for the end zone, ball outstretched.<eos> Zebra puts his arms up.<eos> Game over.<eos> State Championship.<eos> Aaron Rodgers stole that from me.<eos> Discount double check my ass.<eos> It was a great day for the whole town.<eos> I puked on a cop car... and no one even cared.<eos> Hey, you know, if you want, I could come down and help you out a bit.
Hey, uh, just do me a favor.<eos> Next time you're gonna try to kiss me, give me a heads up.<eos> Oh, I can turn the charm down.<eos> I can't turn it off, but I can turn it down.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Okay, the old "I was too drunk to remember."<eos> - Okay. Been there.<eos> - No.<eos> FYI, that does not hold up in court.<eos> I did not try to kiss you.
FYI, that does not hold up in court.<eos> I did not try to kiss you.<eos> Uh... yeah, you did.<eos> You were on the couch and I come over and I said, "Are you okay?"<eos> And then you were like...<eos> And I was like, "Whoa!"<eos> And you were like, "Aw!"<eos> And I was like, "Uh..."<eos> And then you were like...<eos> Are you serious? I tried to kiss you?
Let me ask you something.<eos> Should I get a birthday gift for Heather?<eos> Why the hell would you do that?<eos> She's not your girlfriend.<eos> You're just having sex with her.<eos> It's like, did I get a baby shower gift for Pregnant Linda?<eos> Of course not, man. It's not my kid.<eos> I'm just having sex with her.<eos> When it comes to stuff like this... I have a system.<eos> It's too late to stop you, isn't it?
Yeah, I totally wasn't expecting a gift.<eos> Hey, did your sister get some new titties?<eos> You dead?<eos> Okay. What are you doin' up?<eos> Mom went back to the Airstream.<eos> Well, what happened?<eos> I asked her to move in.<eos> She said no.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> Dad... I've been here through... all the stuff with you guys and... I know it makes you uncomfortable to hear, but I do love you.
Then Shane rides off into the night.<eos> I don't know why, but it gets me every time, too.<eos> I remember that movie.<eos> We watched it on our honeymoon.<eos> Three times.<eos> You drive all the way back out here to tell me that I ruined our honeymoon, too?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't go home.<eos> I've just been driving around, thinking.<eos> I... I came up here before to see if I could help you, I didn't wanna add to your problems.
Hmm. Yeah, he gets hot flashes.<eos> He's going through the change.<eos> You know what, honey, um, why don't you grab your coat and I'll drop you at home before work?<eos> Okay. - Hey, where do you work?<eos> - Cracker Barrel.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Jackpot.<eos> Get us a discount?<eos> You know I can.<eos> I know this is a little fast, but I think I love you.
I was upset over you.<eos> Her husband had just passed.<eos> We talked.<eos> That's it.<eos> I know all that.<eos> I brought up Brenda to prove a point.<eos> When things get uncomfortable, you shut down.<eos> And I'm afraid if I move back into that house... we're gonna go back to the way we were before I left.<eos> I'm not saying things are gonna be perfect.<eos> Oh, that was clear when you told me I annoy you.
I'm pretty sure this barrel's big enough for the both of us. No, I'm sorry.<eos> I just meant that it would be better if...<eos> Oh, look at that. You got the chocolate...<eos> Fuck me.<eos> Kenny, is that...<eos> Are you...<eos> Sweetie... Uh, this isn't how I planned it, but, uh...<eos> Ah... you are smart, you're beautiful... you're oddly competitive.<eos> You could have picked anybody in the world, and you chose me.<eos> I love you more than anything in the world.
I said Severide's name and your face turned all 50 shades of red.<eos> You guys know each other?<eos> Marrying you would be my greatest honor.
- You have a family here.<eos> - Can't do it, Harv.<eos> But you got no problem chasing down Strange's freaks?<eos> Yeah, it pays the rent.<eos> You are a cop in everything but name.<eos> Yeah, except I don't have to listen to Barnes.<eos> I get to go home when I want, get drunk when I want.<eos> And at the end of the day, I sleep.<eos> 'Cause saving Gotham's not my job anymore.<eos> Jim, I love you like a brother, but you've got to stop blaming the job for what happened between you and Lee.
People pass it down unsolved for generations.<eos> A mathematician once went mad trying...<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> It was a lovely thought.<eos> And did you got the biscuits?<eos> A-And the sweater?<eos> I-I know how drafty these rooms are.<eos> - Mr. Penguin.<eos> - Oswald.<eos> When I think of how I treated you... Stop.
Yeah.<eos> Things that are hard to talk about... that hurt too much...<eos> Maybe it's good that someone makes you look at those things.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I mean, it is weird talking in front of strangers, but...<eos> But they don't let you just stand there and say anything you want.<eos> You know, they question it.<eos> Make you question it.<eos> Yeah. Right.<eos> They keep you honest.
That is what she was.<eos> She was a human being.<eos> At least she's alive.<eos> You didn't have to send her out onto the street to get mowed down.<eos> You want to talk about Gregory now?<eos> I have not said a word about Gregory all this time.<eos> But you still think about him, apparently.<eos> Of course I still think about him!<eos> Well, I'm sorry the man you loved died and you're stuck with me!<eos> I am stuck with you because I took you back after you slept with the woman who had your son... and you lied to my face about it!
No more personal clocks, radios.<eos> Pens?<eos> You'd think so, wouldn't you?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Take a load off.<eos> You're gonna have to work on that.<eos> None of my business anymore, but, uh... I can't stop thinking about you and Burov.<eos> Maybe he can't be turned, of course, or... or maybe you've turned him already, but my instinct tells me you haven't.<eos> It's your operation, Stan.<eos> And screw the Deputy A.G. and screw your new boss and screw the Director if they're pressuring you... but it might be that you're holding off with Burov because your conscience is bothering you, because of what happened to Nina.
Yeah, no, I did, but I mean, so did chimps, right?<eos> Huh?<eos> Being modest.<eos> You know, and speaking of hairy animals, what's with the beard, Sasquatch?<eos> - It's, uh, just, uh...<eos> - Hey, I think Tandy's beard is sexy.<eos> Thank you, Carol.<eos> And why is everybody using your middle name?<eos> Wh... uh, funny story, tragic story.<eos> You know, I'm surprised that people aren't calling you by your nickname.
And you know what happens if we object?<eos> We disappear.<eos> Like off the map.<eos> Like every American Idol winner since season four.<eos> Come on, Howard, you're overreacting.<eos> Am I?<eos> Am I?<eos> Wha-- what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I'm no longer in it?<eos> That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.<eos> Okay, look, I'm on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions.
Are you kidding?<eos> They're probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.<eos> What about the guy on the Channel Four News?<eos> You know, "Four on Your Side"?<eos> Maybe he can be on your side.<eos> I'm being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.<eos> Oh, stop!<eos> You know what's really happening?<eos> All the movies you've watched, the TV shows, the comic books-- they've completely twisted your thinking.<eos> No one's after you, no one's listening to you, no one cares about you.
I spoke to your mother last week.<eos> No, it's good.<eos> I was checking up on her.<eos> She told me you spent the summer there.<eos> Said she was grateful you came.<eos> Are you gonna tell me where he is, Dad?<eos> Frank.<eos> You're chasing after a man who's not worthy of you.<eos> You stalked him, too?<eos> Not yet, but I hear you leave these pathetic messages to a man who clearly doesn't appreciate you.
I know why you're angry.<eos> I understand.<eos> I never saw you, not this person you've become.<eos> I see her now.<eos> You've taken everything you've been through, all the pain, and you turned it into strength.<eos> And for that, I am proud of you.<eos> Very, very proud.<eos> Porfavor,pleasedon 'tever disappear on me like that again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can I help you?
How?<eos> Laurel. You tried to kill Frank.<eos> You're a dumbass if you believe that.<eos> So you didn't hire a hitman? I didn't.<eos> Well, Frank's trying to frame me for this.<eos> Maybe someone should kill him.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> -Don't you dare go after him.<eos> -I did this for you, Annalise.<eos> No, you did it for yourself, to get the love that no one ever gave you.
This is Frank.<eos> He gave the police your name to make you a suspect.<eos> No.<eos> He -- Stop defending him!<eos> He thinks that we're gonna tell the police he killed Mahoney.<eos> This is his way of hitting back.<eos> Take Wes' phone, lose it at the library, and you don't leave this house until I say so.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> I'm just gonna talk to them.<eos> You take another step, and I'll chain you in the basement like Rebecca.
Don't be stupid. You still care about him.<eos> I lost a child because of him.<eos> Car accident.<eos> Your father caused it. Frank helped him.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> It is.<eos> All this is happening because you keep trying to protect me.<eos> That was my choice.<eos> I took you off the waitlist.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I want to be there for you, Michaela.<eos> No, you want me to be there for you, like every other guy who's screwed me over.<eos> I like you so much.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Okay" like you like me, too? Whatever.<eos> No.<eos> I want you to say it.<eos> I like you, too.
Previously on "Dark Matter"...<eos> Something really bad happened to you there.
Well, once we're parked, me and Nyx will check the place out.<eos> You stay back in the "Marauder" with Four.<eos> You're not gonna learn anything new, are you?<eos> Are you suggesting I'm wasting our time?<eos> No.<eos> I think in your mind, you're putting it to the best use possible, all things considered.<eos> You're trying to give me hope, take my mind off of what's going on down on that planet.<eos> That would be atypical android behavior.<eos> But it would be perfectly normal behavior for a friend.<eos> I appreciate you, everyone looking out for me.
Practical enough to convince you?<eos> I understand why you did what you did.<eos> Divided loyalties, I empathize.<eos> My home world is about to lose an interplanetary war.<eos> And defeat will cost it for generations to come.<eos> And all I can do is watch it happen.<eos> No, my place is with my people, not sitting idle on a spaceship.<eos> So you're actually thinking of leaving.<eos> There isn't a day that goes by that I don't consider it.<eos> Then what's stopping you?
He didn't have a choice.<eos> Wait, you're...<eos> Oh, my God, you're Rebecca.<eos> - Please don't kill us.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you.<eos> I just need your help.<eos> We need your retinas.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I should warn you that rather than helping to calm one's nerves, coffee acts as a stimulant.
Take him out.<eos> I probably should have phrased that differently.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> Even if he was an unwilling participant, what kind of example am I setting for my other employees if I let him just walk out of here?<eos> Loyalty is an extremely important part of my business.<eos> Oh, I am really gonna enjoy killing you.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I don't think I'm going to give you that pillow.<eos> I should've gone.<eos> No, facial recog would've nabbed you in a second.
Hey, listen, I need to talk to you about Three.<eos> What about him?<eos> He's not himself.<eos> Hey. What are you doing down here?<eos> Let's get him to the infirmary.<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> You tell us.<eos> What did Rook do to you?<eos> I don't know what, you're talking about.<eos> What did he tell you?
It's your fault.<eos> You think I don't notice you raising the volume?<eos> - Yell quieter, and I won't have to.<eos> - When's it due?<eos> Come on!<eos> - Stop with the volume.<eos> - All in your hands.<eos> In my defense, I've only known about it for three weeks.<eos> Brick, next year, you're gonna be in high school.<eos> You can't keep going through life expecting people to bail you out at the last...
But he's wrong.<eos> It's inhumane to not take milk, because then it builds up, and it hurts.<eos> I think I know a little more about it than him.<eos> I miss breastfeeding.<eos> Breast.<eos> They should make travel toothbrushes.<eos> There's a million-dollar idea.<eos> I used to worry about how clingy she was.<eos> She would never let me leave the room when I used to say good night to her.<eos> I would say, "I love you,"

You did well.<eos> You got a 95%.<eos> Oh, I can't believe I missed number two.<eos> So, look, Jeremy.<eos> I...<eos> I really appreciate what you're trying to do here.<eos> It is, uh, easy to see and smell how passionate you are.<eos> Um, but I think it's time that you came back to class.<eos> I can't keep bringing you your tests and assignments every day, and I'm afraid that you're gonna fall behind.<eos> But... and here's an idea... um, if you felt like you were ready to come back to class, then maybe Sue could catch you up to speed.
Jeremy:<eos> This is a really nice moment.<eos> ♪<eos> [Keyboard clacking]<eos> [Sighs]<eos> Hey, Axl, can I ask you for some advice?<eos> Just clear your history.<eos> No, Axl, I'm serious.<eos> I'm your brother, Brick.<eos> I'm happy to drop some knowledge on you as long as you ball socks while I do it.
[Sighs]<eos> - [Sighs]<eos> - Well, I guess we ought to separate<eos> Bogie and Bacall over there.<eos> Okay, Brick.<eos> Wrap it up.<eos> Goodbye, Brick.<eos> Goodbye, Cindy.<eos> [Car door closes]<eos> I'll call you when I get there.
Hang up the phones, pop a mint, and go get a cup of coffee.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Go to work.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> She's a little pushy.<eos> Wonder where she gets it from.<eos> I mean, uh, we don't need to meet, right?<eos> This is fun the way it is.<eos> This is great.<eos> I've said things to you I've never been able to say to anyone else.
We have no choice.<eos> I love it when you say we have no choice.<eos> [phone rings]<eos> Shit, sorry.<eos> Has it cost you a lot, me being Mayor of Marseille?<eos> Meaning?<eos> I can't even remember if I went with you to the airport when you left for Canada.<eos> No, Dad, you weren't there, but Mom was and so was Lucas.<eos> But I wasn't.<eos> The fact that you remember means it affected you.
-What do you think, Julia?<eos> Why are you still living in that godforsaken place?<eos> Where else do you expect me to go?<eos> Tell me something, anything.<eos> I want a clean apartment.<eos> With an elevator that works.<eos> Is that so hard?<eos> I swear, I've been saving every cent.<eos> I can't take any more, Julia.<eos> I want to be able to invite you to my apartment, into my room.
How?<eos> He's not an orphan.<eos> He has a mother.<eos> She's in prison in Rennes.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> He wouldn't lie about that.<eos> I swear, he did.<eos> We're in the middle of an election and you're wasting your time on this?<eos> Not at all. We'll tell the press, and he'll be revealed as a liar.<eos> I forbid you to do that.
Listen...<eos> We had a passionate but very brief affair.<eos> I was 20.<eos> I was a student in Aix and she was from Paris.<eos> That's all.<eos> Surely you don't think I'm going to leave it there?<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> - I want you to tell me I have a brother.<eos> The guy you've been fighting with for a month is my brother.<eos> - I forbid you from seeing Rachel.
What is the bag for?<eos> I'm leaving, Troy.<eos> OK. That could be a really positive thing for you.<eos> I'm going with her.<eos> No!<eos> What about me? You still want to get him over before we go?<eos> Yeah. You're a fucking idiot.<eos> Take my car.<eos> Yep. You coming?<eos> I don't want to help you any more today.
I ain't dying in this shithole.<eos> I am.<eos> I will.<eos> But, Truss, you need to tell me that you're not going to say anything.<eos> I'm not taking you back until you tell me we have a deal.<eos> All right. Here's the deal.<eos> You take me back... .. and with my last breath, I tell everyone what you are.<eos> I don't make deals with morks.<eos> Just say the words to me.<eos> What is the matter with you?
The Portia Lin I've heard of, the one from all the stories, would never risk her life and her ship and what's left of her crew to get revenge for a guy like Moss.<eos> In fact, the moment she found out he was an impostor, she would've strung him up and gutted him.<eos> Sounds messy.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> You were a predator, like me, and we take from the weak and from the helpless because we're stronger.<eos> Because we can.<eos> You started to care.<eos> You're vulnerable, and soon the whole galaxy'll see what I can see.<eos> You're finished.<eos> I'm prepared to shoot you down in cold blood.
What?<eos> I assumed Traugott hired him to kill One, but he says it was someone else.<eos> I don't know if he was just playing with me, or...<eos> The last time I saw One, he said he was worried about the CEO of his father's company.<eos> One was in line to take his place.<eos> Another enemy to add to the list.<eos> There's always room for one more.<eos> Nothing like a hard day of seeking revenge to make a man hungry, huh?<eos> On second thoughts, I just lost my appetite.<eos> You should know, he risked his life to help you.
Mind you, I don't know how you're gonna do that without the Blink Drive.<eos> Well, how did he do it?<eos> Little help from his friends.<eos> Go on.<eos> I can vent the atmosphere in there, stand here, and watch you die.<eos> I'm shaking.<eos> Try me.<eos> After Eos-7, the corporations backing Pyr pulled out.<eos> They had bigger things to worry about, so we took advantage and helped Zairon destroy their fleet.<eos> And they welcomed you back with open arms.

Prep it.<eos> We're on our way back.<eos> - Prep what?<eos> The nuke.<eos> This mining colony's about to learn the hard way, you don't mess with Ferrous Corp.<eos> "Raza," this is the "Marauder."<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Stand down.<eos> What?<eos> I'm ordering you to stand down.
Mike, what a pleasant surprise, geez, to say the least, yeah.<eos> So, uh, uh, this your new place?<eos> Yeah, not bad, huh?<eos> What's the, uh, deal with all the-the water bottles and such?<eos> Oh, yeah, this is just a little home security system I rigged up.<eos> Why would you need something like that?<eos> No reason.<eos> See you got your little suit on, huh?<eos> Laundry day.<eos> Can I help you?
I'll stop when he stops, and he will never stop, Carol.<eos> Hey, I want you to see something.<eos> Look at these two little boys.<eos> They love each other so much.<eos> I mean, yeah, we had some good times.<eos> Hey, trust me, you show him this stuff, it will turn on his heart light.<eos> Family's everyone's weak spot.<eos> Hmm. You're right, it is.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I was reading this letter that Mom and Dad wrote you while you were in space.
I-I already told you I was stopping.<eos> Half of me really wants to give it to you, but the other half needs it for insurance.<eos> All right, I'm gonna go put this in my hiding place, and don't bother looking for it, 'cause you'll never find it.<eos> Now, let's take a wild guess here.<eos> Typical Skidmark.<eos> Our dearest Michael, I miss you so much.<eos> I wish I could say everything has been great down here since you left.<eos> Unfortunately, that's not the case.<eos> We buried your father yesterday, and I know it's only a matter of time for me.<eos> Just know how proud your father and I were to call you our son.
Just tell me what you need.<eos> 'Cause I can give 100% to every person on the face of the earth, and still have 100% to give to you, Gail, and you, Melissa.<eos> Now-now I know that adds up to be about 600%, but what can I say?<eos> I've never been good at math.<eos> Just about the only thing I am good at... is Todd.<eos> Anybody has any issues with that, there's the friggin' door.<eos> I mean, I'll get it for you.<eos> Well, thank you for listening.<eos> That was hot.<eos> God, they loved you.

Hmm.
No, come on, man!<eos> We're period pals.<eos> It's the fair thing to do, girlfriend.<eos> You can go the next day.<eos> the next day is not opening day.<eos> The next day is not tradition.<eos> The next day is not Beau and Rooster sitting in the duck blind, eating peanut butter and banana sandwiches and killing majestic woodland creatures.<eos> Look, Dad decided.<eos> And, for the record, I'd have been okay with whatever decision you made.<eos> 'Cause I love you, Daddy.
Minus the rent, let's make it 2,500.<eos> Hop in.<eos> Sorry, sweetheart. Family stuff.<eos> He'll catch up with you later.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Throw your bike in the back.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll call you later, yeah?
Shit, Renn.<eos> I-I gotta go. Shit!<eos> I gotta go.<eos> - Just like that? - Yeah.<eos> Put everything in the truck.<eos> Leaving town tells them we're guilty.<eos> Yeah, we are.<eos> In, in, in.<eos> Hey, Craig, give Deran a hand inside and get the cash behind the dryer, okay?<eos> I'm gonna call you when we get to the safe house.
You let him get away!<eos> Let go of me, man!<eos> You've been out for a month, and you risk everything for 12 grand? !<eos> Oh, what about you?<eos> Drugs across the border? Yeah, no risk there.<eos> You should have come to me first!<eos> I gotta run everything by you now? - Is that how it works?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Since you went away, yes.<eos> Are you really mad that I did a job or is it that I cleared more than you?
Can I have more?<eos> J makes it better than you.<eos> What...<eos> J?<eos> He brought the mac and cheese.<eos> What?<eos> He's in the bathroom.<eos> What are you doing here, man?<eos> Is that my mom?<eos> Did Smurf send you?
Smurf takes my child without asking, and you want me to apologize?<eos> You said shit you shouldn't have said! No, I should have hit her with the car!<eos> Okay.<eos> Do it for me, then, please. Just do it for me.<eos> Screw... you.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Stand up for me.<eos> - Cath, fix it.<eos> Fix it!<eos> What is going on with you?
Oh, I've been busy.<eos> Can't answer your phone?<eos> Let me guess... you caved, huh?<eos> Smurf's right on this one.<eos> Running the small jobs on the side... it ain't worth the risk.<eos> It's just not.<eos> Pussies.<eos> It's time to come home. It's time.<eos> Oh, so Smurf says we can work again and we just jump right to it?<eos> I know she's been riding you. I get it. I get that you want to punish her, but this whole routine is getting a little old, don't you think?
I want to leave her.<eos> How was it down there?<eos> It was good.<eos> It was really good.<eos> Hey, you remember Wayne Cullen?<eos> Should I?<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> When I was 11, you beat the shit out of him.<eos> Why?<eos> I asked you to.
And the... the second the cops breathe in his direction, he's going to point them right to us.<eos> Pope, I can handle him.<eos> I got a feeling he's ready to cross a line.<eos> He wants it. - He just needs a push.<eos> I'm telling you... - No. No!<eos> No!<eos> We case a joint, we go in with guns, we come out with cash.<eos> It's not that complicated.<eos> Like the Wells Fargo job?<eos> So easy it landed you in prison.
You really feel that way?<eos> Deran?<eos> Tell her, man.<eos> Pussy!<eos> I think Pope will be happy to fill in for you.<eos> And I'll remember who pulled their weight when I divvy up the take.<eos> Cath?<eos> Cath.<eos> Hey.<eos> We waited for you, but Lena was tired.
You know, guys come into the bar and hit on me all the time.<eos> I'm not cheating on you, Cath. Okay?<eos> Used to be a pain in the ass, trying to let them down gently without losing tips.<eos> Now I look forward to it, someone wanting to talk to me.<eos> I was at my dad's.<eos> He lives in a trailer over in Vista.<eos> I thought he was in for life.<eos> I guess the state thought 26 years was enough.<eos> You're talking to him?<eos> After everything he did to you...
So many choices.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Hey.<eos> I heard about Nicky.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Did Smurf tell you?<eos> I thought things were good.<eos> Me, too, man.<eos> Not for her, I guess.<eos> So she dumped you?
It's important.<eos> The warning signs are loud and clear.<eos> Guys like Pope turn violent.<eos> You're in danger.<eos> I know.<eos> Listen, you're...<eos> y-y-you're not on your own.<eos> You trust me, right?<eos> Good. Good.<eos> 'Cause, um, I think I know somebody who can help you.
Halt!<eos> Stop where you are!<eos> What the hell you think you're doing?<eos> You miss the signs on that fence you climbed over?<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir. I...<eos> I wanted to see the Chinooks.<eos> You know, people at school, they say they look really cool when they take off.<eos> Was it worth it?<eos> I'm sorry, sir?<eos> Considering what's about to happen to you, I'm asking you, was it worth it?
'Cause that'd be crazy.<eos> I didn't want to say it on the phone, but I won't do it.<eos> I've loved Baz since I was 16.<eos> I can't turn on him.<eos> What would that make me?<eos> Think carefully, Catherine.<eos> Walk away now, next time you see me, I'm cuffing you.<eos> I'll take that chance.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> I figured I'd scared you off.
The boys expect it when they get back.<eos> God, I hate this part... the waiting.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> No news is good news.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Smurf, I know that we don't always see things the same way.<eos> But I think... for whatever reason that's happened in the past, it would be a good thing if we could put that behind us, start over.<eos> Is that supposed to be an apology, sweetheart?<eos> Sure.<eos> Baz put you up to it?
She's talking to the cops, Andrew.<eos> Baby, I know you always loved her. But she's a user.<eos> She used me. She uses you.<eos> We saved her from those bastards she called parents.<eos> We brought her into our family.<eos> But that girl, she only cared about herself.<eos> I watched her lead you on... promising you things.<eos> But she was never honest.<eos> She was not honest with you or with any of us.<eos> She's betrayed you, Andrew.

There is a guy, he comes into the bar.<eos> You met him. He's a cop.<eos> Lena likes him.<eos> He lets her sit in his car.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> You're in danger.<eos> I would never go to the police.<eos> I know.<eos> I told Smurf that.<eos> And did she believe you?
Costa Rica or Belize.<eos> It's so beautiful there.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Hey, Josh, dig in.<eos> Want some soda?<eos> Hey, sorry we took so long.<eos> Traffic on PCH was a bitch.<eos> The summer crowds are definitely back.<eos> So, what time will Smurf be expecting you back home for dinner?
- Yeah, Paul.<eos> There is a ton of cash on that base.<eos> This is a big job.<eos> We're taking a lot of risks.<eos> What's your name, dude?<eos> I'm Vin.<eos> Did you see Lucy while you were there?<eos> How's Cath?<eos> I hadn't seen Cath in weeks, and then she shows up, steals 10 grand from behind the dryer, and disappears.<eos> She's betrayed you over and over, and now she's betraying your family.
Take the back door.<eos> And if the cops stop you, you tell them you were looking for your daughter.<eos> That you had a big fight over birth control.<eos> You're a piece of work, you know that?<eos> I said the back door.<eos> You should've told me right away.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Why were you sure I wouldn't have one of the boys put a bullet in your head and dump your body in the ocean?<eos> I wasn't.<eos> You know, even with all the shit that my mom put you through, you... you still paid our rent, you know?
Sam!<eos> I got Nate.<eos> He's breathing.<eos> Nate, can you hear me?<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Come out now!<eos> Put your hands up!<eos> Drop your weapons!<eos> Now.<eos> What took you so long?
Yeah, and when we find him, I got a little score to settle with him.<eos> You okay?<eos> Why's everyone keep asking me that?<eos> 'Cause everyone cares about you, caveman.<eos> How you sure you didn't crack a rib or something?<eos> Oh, I've cracked a couple ribs playing football in high school.<eos> This ain't that.<eos> Let's have a look.<eos> Look, I'm fine, really. It's nothing.<eos> It's not nothing if where the assailant kicked you is evidence.
She's just told me you're half mork.<eos> Of course it's not true.<eos> She's completely insane.<eos> Everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie.<eos> I am not half alien.<eos> He's a shit liar.<eos> So, now you have to make a decision.<eos> You OK?<eos> You lost?<eos> Look, let me help you.
That's good.<eos> I'm gonna put that on your tombstone.<eos> ? He said he was fine.<eos> He was wrong?"<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Give us a second, would you?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
- I'm Jill.<eos> Uh, so tell me why'd you decide to study law?<eos> Well, before I got sober, I frequently needed a lawyer, so I figured, why not cut out the middleman.<eos> Also, I wanted to do something worthwhile, try to help people.<eos> Me, too.<eos> That's why I give my housekeeper Botox every Christmas.<eos> Nobody likes a wrinkly maid.<eos> I see.<eos> It's terrific.<eos> Uh, I've never seen you at this meeting before, right?
!<eos> You're embarrassing me in front of Eric.<eos> It's Derek.<eos> I said hang on!<eos> I thought you were gonna help me.<eos> Well, I'm trying, but now you're making a scene.<eos> Uh, I actually have to go... call my sponsor.<eos> Thank you so very much.<eos> What is your problem?<eos> I was trying to get you and Brown Jacket off to Maui.
But "they" aren't any of us, so you're wasting your time.<eos> Worse, what you should be focusing on is the sniper.<eos> Town's on edge, Agent Isler.<eos> That should be our only priority.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Smells good in here.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Grits and grillades, just like how my mama taught me.<eos> And this is vegan, I trust?<eos> Can't very well leave you out now, can I?
Punch it, June!<eos> Hit the deck!<eos> Made it.<eos> L.A. riverbed is my bingo.<eos> Fuel's at zero.<eos> I'm setting down.<eos> Thank you... to you and your whole team.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> You gonna answer that question or what?<eos> I've given to you my heart and my soul, more than I've ever given to anyone.
It's gone missing off the coast of Southern California.<eos> Are you saying the hackers are controlling a sub with nukes on it?<eos> That's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> I would like to explain myself.<eos> I don't want to hear it.<eos> There's no excuse.<eos> That's true.<eos> But there is context.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I went to Tahoe to tell you I love you.
Look, I'm sorry. I am.<eos> But Mick didn't do it.<eos> He is a thief and a murderer.<eos> He's also a Legend, and Mick hasn't been off the ship since we dropped your team off at the JSA.<eos> With his last words, he told me his killer was a time traveler.<eos> You know, we've been tracking someone who's been trying to alter history.<eos> We think it's the same person that gave Krieger the super-serum.<eos> This might be your time traveler.<eos> Look, if I let you out of here, you promise not to hurt Mick unless he really deserves it?<eos> Sorry for knocking you out. Sorry for locking you up.
You think I'm not focusing?<eos> Like... enough!<eos> - I can't do it. - Yes, you can.<eos> You don't think I don't want to save the girl, spare the village, and be a hero for once in my damn life?<eos> I spent half of my childhood in the hospital where it didn't even occur to me to dream about having superpowers.<eos> But guess what?<eos> I got 'em, I lost 'em, now I really, really need 'em, and I can't get 'em back.<eos> This isn't all about you.<eos> I worked for years, spent billions of dollars to develop the ATOM suit.<eos> I nearly died learning to shrink, and now, I have to teach you to destroy the very thing, the only thing, that makes me a hero.
Haircut. Steel.<eos> Sara says we got to clear out.<eos> - Good-bye, Masako.<eos> - Good-bye, Nate.<eos> What an amazing time period.<eos> Definitely my favorite, besides the Old West.<eos> Why are you two goofy bastards so happy?<eos> You lost your damn suit, the food sucks, and I've got no proof ninjas exist.<eos> What are you staring at?<eos> I've figured you out.
No suit, no powers, no tech.<eos> I mean, I guess Sara had no choice but to bench him.<eos> Well, I-I'm sure she's just trying to keep him safe.<eos> This time period is replete with various perils.<eos> Perhaps it might be easier if he were to remain behind and keep Dr. Palmer company.<eos> Perhaps you should remain behind.<eos> No?<eos> Because you're not black.<eos> Because you think that, me going back to 1863,<eos> - That doesn't mean there's a need for you to subject yourself to the horrors that await you in that era.

On the other hand, if you are dead, please stay dead.<eos> Just unconscious, well done.<eos> Now, where's that fire extinguisher?<eos> Okay, Martin.<eos> Just do what they did... in those zombie movies... that you never had the courage to watch.<eos> Come on!<eos> That gentleman is either the bravest man I have ever had in my ranks, or the dumbest.<eos> If... if you'd...<eos> If you'd just cooperate things will go much easier for us.<eos> You may be stronger, but I assure you, you will not eat me today.

Like I said before, fraternization among teammates is unprofessional.<eos> Rex and I were going to leave the JSA after the war, try and start a new life with each other.<eos> And then he was cut down.<eos> That's why I left the team, and that's why I wouldn't talk to you about them.<eos> It's too hard.<eos> And this is why I'm reluctant to help you.<eos> Because your emotions are clouding your judgment.<eos> She won't be facing Darhk alone.<eos> We need your help.<eos> I know you feel like I abandoned you, but, please, don't abandon me.
You haven't aged a bit.<eos> Lazarus Pit?<eos> Oh, woman of mystery.<eos> I know that look in your eye, though.<eos> That's the look of someone that I've taken everything from.<eos> Not everything.<eos> You haven't taken my soul, which I've already lost, and I'm not eager to do again.<eos> And that's why I'm sparing your life.<eos> How merciful of you.<eos> I'm sparing you to prolong your suffering.
The time traveler working against us...<eos> He's a speedster.<eos> - Like the Flash?<eos> - Faster.<eos> So the speedster and Darhk, they have whatever the KGB gave Darhk?<eos> Unless...<eos> Unless?<eos> I swiped it off Darhk.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Can I hug you? Do we hug?
Let's start with him.<eos> Rest of you will have to wait your turn.<eos> Uh, I think we have a misunderstanding.<eos> See, we're the good guys.<eos> The president invited us here.<eos> Barry, I think it's time we do something.<eos> And fast.<eos> - Sniper!<eos> - On it.<eos> We're trying to help you.
Looks like your friend's not calling you back.<eos> No, he's not, but I got a plan B.<eos> - Okay. - If this came from the dropship and the dropship came from the mother ship, theoretically, I could use it to vibe us up there.<eos> And if you can't?<eos> Then I'd be vibing us into the cold, unforgiving vacuum of space.<eos> - So let's not do that.<eos> - Yeah, let's not. Okay.<eos> What an unusual gift.<eos> You appear to be a meta-human as well.<eos> Yeah, well, I figured you'd cut me some slack, seeing as how we saved you back in 1951.
Time travel is real, and all of history is vulnerable to attack, which is why we must travel through time to stop the spread of these so-called time aberrations, and to erase their damage to history.<eos> We are a team of outcasts and misfits, so please don't call us heroes.<eos> We're something else.<eos> We're legends.<eos> Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> You're back!<eos> I love you, Dad.
I have a daughter.<eos> A what?<eos> A full-grown human progeny who I never even knew I had.<eos> - This beautiful, brilliant...<eos> - And not real. At first, no, but then I remembered.<eos> I remembered the... The countless nights I spent pacing the neighborhood with her stroller, trying to get her to sleep. The... the...<eos> The way my heart melted the first time she smiled at me.<eos> The... the distress she caused her kindergarten teacher when she insisted on singing the periodic table instead of the alphabet.<eos> I-I... I remembered all of it.<eos> But none of that happened to you.
- Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.<eos> - I speak six languages, why...<eos> Stein's about to kill Sara in the library.<eos> With the rope or the candlestick?<eos> Guys, I'm serious.<eos> Somehow, the speedster's disguised himself as Stein, and he's turning over the whole ship.<eos> - I'll suit up.<eos> - I know how to get Sara away from fake Stein. What about that speedster gun?<eos> Yeah, I'm already on it.<eos> Martin, you've been acting pretty different ever since Darhk tortured you.
Then how do we stop him?<eos> What would a criminal do?<eos> Run.<eos> Steel-up.<eos> Isn't that just like a thug?<eos> Brings a Tommy gun to an ion blaster fight?<eos> Hey, I stole that fair and square.<eos> This belongs to me.<eos> Surprise.<eos> The League taught you well, but unless you hand over the amulet, I'm gonna have to teach you a few new lessons.
Sounds screwy.<eos> Actually, it'd make a pretty good movie one day.<eos> You know, if this is the week the Feds get Capone's ledger, why does it take four more years for them to take him down?<eos> Because it's the federal government.<eos> Now that's the Mick Rory I remember, always thinking with his stomach.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Anyway, I thought I'd find you in here.<eos> That speedster hit you pretty hard, huh?
I'm sorry, I...<eos> I guess I don't fully understand why you're so upset at him.<eos> Then maybe you shouldn't bring it up again.<eos> Yeah. How about we talk about us instead?<eos> Us?<eos> You... you mean you and me, like, trying this?<eos> I just thought with everything that's happened lately and everything that you've been through, I wanted to make sure that you still felt the same.<eos> Well, Iris, I did what you said.<eos> I went where I needed to go, I did what I needed to do, and I'm ready.<eos> I never told you to do that.
No, I'm fine.<eos> Why? Why?<eos> Because you've been acting real odd lately.<eos> Asking why Iris wasn't at the house last night.<eos> And that stunt you pulled at S.T.A.R. Labs this morning.<eos> You know damn well why she's not talking to me.<eos> Of course.<eos> Uh, because sh...<eos> Because I should have told her her mother was alive but I didn't.<eos> Yeah, but she forgave you for that.
- What's that? - That's the finished Edward Clariss report.<eos> Or should I say The Rival?<eos> At least, that's what The Flash called him last night when he took him into Iron Heights.<eos> - I thought you might want to see it.<eos> You know, to do with your other case.<eos> Actually it turns out there was no connection.<eos> You know, I have to ask you.<eos> - How did you know his name?<eos> - What?<eos> Yesterday, you came in and you asked for Edward Clariss' report, but I didn't tell you who that husk belonged to, so that means you stole a sample when you showed up to my crime scene.
Let's go to the Speed Lab.<eos> Speed Lab?<eos> This is insane.<eos> Something tells me you've never been in this room before.<eos> Nope.<eos> Wait, you... you nev...<eos> Allen.<eos> I suppose that means you traveled back in time again.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> How many times did I tell you not to do that?
Here you are.<eos> Hey, so, where... where did you go yesterday?<eos> I didn't want to interrupt your training.<eos> Right. Yeah, well, looks like there won't be much of that anymore, now that my dad is getting everyone to talk me out of using my powers.<eos> Wait, that...that's not why you're here, right?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is all me.<eos> You all right?<eos> You know, when this whole thing happened to me, you were... you were actually the first person I wanted to call.<eos> Yeah, I was sort of hoping it happened to you too.
Fine, but I don't need to stay here and listen to this anymore.<eos> Jesse! Don't...<eos> What did you say to her?<eos> Me?<eos> Yeah. You.<eos> Don't blame me for this.<eos> I tried to help.<eos> Help her or help me?<eos> Listen, Harry.<eos> Maybe the reason she's shutting you out is because you're not trying to understand
I know you can do it.<eos> You're more than fast enough.<eos> Now, run, Jesse.<eos> Run!<eos> Hey, thought you could use a little help.<eos> I got this.<eos> You go take care of her.<eos> Magenta!<eos> I got a little help.<eos> So I could help you.
I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> So no one else got hurt?<eos> Luckily, no.<eos> You don't have to worry about that.<eos> What about John?<eos> The DA's prosecuting him for what he did to you.
Dad, I know.<eos> I mean, of course I know.<eos> And I will always love you.<eos> Even when you drive me absolutely insane.<eos> So...<eos> So...<eos> Are we going home or...<eos> I think we'll stay for a few days, run a few more tests, and also to see... if this fits you.<eos> Cisco did the insignia.<eos> Snow thought this would help you, and
- That's it?<eos> - Yeah, that's it.<eos> So now what?<eos> Now... we go get a Big Belly burger.<eos> - That's insane.<eos> What a rush.<eos> - I know. I mean, it took me a while to get used to it.<eos> I can't believe you're not sick at all.<eos> I must have an iron stomach.<eos> Okay, so you're telling me that Barry has never taken you on a run?
This is our last one.<eos> It's coming from Earth-19.<eos> Hello, hello, hello.<eos> Hello, out there in the multiverse, whoever you may be.<eos> I really enjoyed cracking the cryptogram you broadcast.<eos> I like the cute trick, embedding the secondary measures in the primary data string.<eos> It's clever.<eos> Most people wouldn't have caught it.<eos> I caught it. But that's the point.<eos> You need a genius, I guess, to help you in your fight against these awful meta-hominids.
I've just been feeling nervous about this new dynamic between the three of us.<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> I have everything that I have ever wanted right now.<eos> And I've never had that in my life.<eos> In a lot of ways, it's scarier than having nothing, because... it's easier to fail than succeed.<eos> And I really want to succeed.<eos> What could you possibly be laughing about right now?<eos> I am so sorry, Barry.<eos> You are really sweet.<eos> But it is weird talking to you through a mirror and a speaker, and I really want to kiss you right now.
- Can I help you?<eos> - I'm here to see Dr. Tannhauser.<eos> Do you have an appointment?<eos> No, but I'm pretty sure she'll see me.<eos> You can just tell her Caitlin Snow is here.<eos> Dr. Tannhauser's a very busy woman.<eos> I'm sure you can understand.<eos> I appreciate the diligence, Jackie, but Caitlin's always welcome here, even if I wish she'd call first.<eos> Nice to see you too, Mom.<eos> So what brings you here?
Sorry, cold hands.<eos> I didn't even notice.<eos> I'm Nigel, by the way.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> We're gonna help you figure this out, Caitlin.<eos> Let's get you to the lab.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's to test how your ability affects molecular motion.<eos> That shaft is solid tungsten, and it's heated to over 2,000 degrees centigrade.<eos> I want you to cool it down, and when we determine how you can do that, we can figure out the best way to help you.
What do you say?<eos> Sorry.<eos> What if I gave up the lab?<eos> There's a storeroom downstairs that I could convert, so if you let me follow you on this case, lab's yours.<eos> Lab's mine?<eos> Okay. Deal.<eos> You can't slow me down, though.<eos> - I would never.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll call you.
- All of it.<eos> - How?<eos> You can barely turn on a computer.<eos> There are two parts to every idea.<eos> There is the inception and the execution.<eos> I provide the former.<eos> So you come up with the ideas?<eos> Yeah, I don't know how to implement them.<eos> I'm the idea man.<eos> So you didn't actually solve the cryptogram that we sent you?
Wallace.<eos> Wallace West.<eos> Hey, Cisco. Yes?<eos> I took your cuffs.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I need them.<eos> Is... is this some sort of, um, bold fashion choice 'cause you're not a meta-hu... hu... human.<eos> Surprise.<eos> It started a few months ago.<eos> That's why you went to see your mom, to see if she could help you.
It's just that when one of my kids is hurting I'm...<eos> Can't think about anything else at all.<eos> Completely understand.<eos> - You have kids?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Daughter. - Oh.<eos> Just turned 18.<eos> I have less than a year before she leaves me for college.<eos> Oh, man, you should have brought her.<eos> I drag you away from her so you can watch a horror movie.
Are you the voice I've been hearing inside my head?<eos> I am Alchemy.<eos> I've been having visions of another life.<eos> Where... where I have speed, where, I'm...<eos> The Flash.<eos> I can give you that back, should you desire it.<eos> I just want the pain to stop.<eos> It will, child.<eos> Whatever you desire, I will see it so.<eos> Now tell me, do you wish for the life that was taken from you to return?
- We don't know that yet.<eos> - Her mother said the more that she uses her powers, the faster she's gonna go.<eos> And saving you from Savitar... that must have put her over the edge.<eos> How do we find her?<eos> I don't know. I tried pinging her cell and Julian's, but she must have ditched them both.<eos> Ahem! If I may proffer a notion...<eos> Oh, great.<eos> More suggestions from the genius over here.<eos> You don't call the genius.<eos> The genius calls you.
Together.<eos> No. You don't understand.<eos> I don't want to lock him up.<eos> - I need him to help me.<eos> - Help you what?<eos> I need him to get rid of my powers.<eos> I don't know if it works that way.<eos> You don't know that it doesn't.<eos> I know that we love you.<eos> And we will do everything that we can to help you.
- I need him to help me.<eos> - Help you what?<eos> I need him to get rid of my powers.<eos> I don't know if it works that way.<eos> You don't know that it doesn't.<eos> I know that we love you.<eos> And we will do everything that we can to help you.<eos> You and I... we've been through too much together to let each other down now.<eos> Please.<eos> Let me help you.
No?<eos> All right.<eos> You're a tea drinker, I bet.<eos> If you want to talk nonsense, I'm gonna need you to stop talking to me.<eos> You're worried about your son.<eos> Do you have kids?<eos> No.<eos> Then I don't think we could possibly have a conversation about... how I'm feeling right now.<eos> Okay, but... as an interested observer, I can tell you<eos> Barry admires you.
Yeah. This is the time and place I gave them, so if they got my message, they should be here...<eos> Right now.<eos> You know why I've never done drugs?<eos> It's 'cause I was always afraid I'd see weird stuff.<eos> Okay, take everybody inside, all right?<eos> - Tell Oliver I'll be right back.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> Well, since we're fighting aliens, I figured we should get one of our own, right?<eos> You found the right Earth?<eos> Tachyon device tracked you on Earth-38 when you met her, so you should find her there.
I knew it was you in that weird space...<eos> Sorry, it took a couple tries to get here.<eos> This is my friend, Cisco.<eos> Well, friend is a loose term.<eos> We work together.<eos> Hi.<eos> Cisco.<eos> I have to say it... this is a nice universe you got here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, do you remember last year when I helped you out and you promised to do the same for me?
Killed two weeks ago.<eos> By a guy who's somewhat promiscuous with his choice of weapons.<eos> Apparently, he threatened another guy you might be familiar with.<eos> Tobias Church.<eos> What was his problem with Church?<eos> According to word on the street,<eos> Church nearly killed you last week.<eos> Well, this guy wants to do the job himself.<eos> Johnny.<eos> They tell you what happened?
Stop digging.<eos> I'm not going to fight these charges.<eos> Johnny, that's insane.<eos> Actually, it's the first thing that's made sense to me in a long while.<eos> Ever since I killed Andy.<eos> You think you need to be punished?<eos> I know I do.<eos> Lyla, I didn't have to pull that trigger, but I did.<eos> Something's wrong with me, baby.<eos> Then let me help you.
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.<eos> Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.<eos> Second test over.<eos> Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.<eos> Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,<eos> I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.<eos> Pass third and final test, find out.<eos> What's the test?<eos> You keep asking about Kovar.<eos> Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.
Realizing that in all those training sessions where he was kicking our respective asses the whole time he was taking it easy on us.<eos> Remind me to never, ever get on his bad side.<eos> Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.<eos> Right because Oliver Queen is known for thinking things through and taking input from others.<eos> Right.<eos> Wow. The ever-expanding club house.<eos> And who are you?<eos> I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.<eos> And also his sister.<eos> Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too?
Ok.<eos> What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery if you can't use it to find anybody?<eos> I feel like I don't understand half the sentences you say.<eos> What I'm saying is is that no matter how hard I try I cannot find Rene anywhere.<eos> And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.<eos> Sounds like another impossible decision.<eos> Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?<eos> I'm saying you were right.<eos> If we're gonna do this, we can't let guilt swallow us up.<eos> I'll keep you from doing it if you promise the same for me.
All right.<eos> It's a party, Viktor.<eos> Let me get you a drink.<eos> You may have passed all the tests and said all the right things, but I do not believe for a second you are Bratva.<eos> Then you weren't paying attention during the ceremony, I guess.<eos> Look around you.<eos> These men are here because government men like Kovar have taken everything from them.<eos> The Bratva is means to bring justice for all those crimes.<eos> Justice is why I'm here.<eos> Heh heh heh. Some American castaway will never understand, so you can say all the words that Anatoly feeds you, but you'll never be one of us, and you should know by now what we do to outsiders.
You guys all right?<eos> Good seeing you again, brother.<eos> Yeah, you, too.<eos> Nice helmet.<eos> Target is secured.<eos> You guys all right?<eos> You look like you've seen a ghost.<eos> Heh. You survived.<eos> I guess I'll just have to kill you again, Oliver.<eos> You mind if I call you Oliver?
Last week, I woke up, with, uh--I don't know-- all bloody, and my arm's cut with that.<eos> So I had a friend on the force run forensics on it, and it turns out that thing is consistent with the Throwing Star killer and his victims.<eos> Ok.<eos> So...<eos> So what?<eos> You--you think you're him, you're-- you're that guy?<eos> I mean...<eos> I don't know what to think anymore, Thea, but, no, I don't think even my drinking could turn me into a psychopath.<eos> So why did you even resign then?<eos> Because I lied to you about going to the meetings, the drinking, and now, this--this psycho, whoever he is, he's--he's messing with me.
Now you show up, and we get aliens.<eos> Superpowers are evil, man, and I don't want anything to do with them or with either of you.<eos> Thea, you have grown into the most beautiful young woman.<eos> It's just a bridesmaid's dress, Mom.<eos> No one actually looks good in one.<eos> Well, you do.<eos> You look fulfilled.<eos> I don't know about that one, Mom, but I--I do know I have never been happier.<eos> - Good.<eos> - And I love you, Mom.
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> You're all this city has.<eos> Now stop being so hard on yourself.<eos> That notebook belonged to my father.<eos> I thought that it was my way to save the city.<eos> We all want to believe in Oliver's crusade, but I am pissed that the guy who only shares the important information with his inner circle used to be a serial killer.<eos> For a long time, I blamed you for my parents dying.
I'm Moira Queen's daughter, and that means throwing a killer Christmas party is in my blood.<eos> Mom and dad would be very proud of you, Speedy.<eos> Me?<eos> Come on.<eos> You're the mayor.<eos> They'd be so happy, they wouldn't know what to do with themselves.<eos> Are you all right? Because what the Dominators showed us, it was a little like losing them all over again.<eos> They didn't take anything away from me.<eos> They gave me something.<eos> Reminded me how lucky I am to be a part of this family and to have you as my brother.
Hmm. To be fair. I didn't make the best first impression.<eos> Well, I, of all people, understand that sometimes doing a job means pissing people off.<eos> It just means that you're doing it well.<eos> I see you've reclaimed your optimism.<eos> Well, thanks to you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Is that your second champagne?<eos> - Third.<eos> - Are you really that nervous to finally introduce me to your friends?<eos> I just want them to love you as much as I liiiike you.
Do you understand me?<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> Yes!<eos> You have until 11 pm tomorrow to make this right.<eos> And what happens if I don't?<eos> I'll aim higher.<eos> SCPD!<eos> Show yourself!<eos> Cute baby.<eos> Cute, yeah, but why would your boyfriend send this to you?
You are sentencing innocent families, children to death.<eos> Nobody cares about those people.<eos> They're a blight...<eos> And I'm just...<eos> thinning the herd.<eos> So am I.<eos> Did you hesitate at all when you killed him, or was he just another name you crossed off your list?<eos> If you want revenge, I'm right here.<eos> This is about so much more than revenge.<eos> I've studied you, Oliver Queen.
Ok. I know I picked the worst possible night to come home late again, but you have to believe me.<eos> This was a seriously terrible day.<eos> Which is not gonna get any better.<eos> I'm going to my brother's house.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> It's been less than 24 hours since your ultimatum.<eos> I never wanted to be the guy that makes ultimatums.<eos> You know it's funny.<eos> You were coming home every night late, banged up all to hell, and I've never seen you happier.<eos> I don't want to be the one to take you away from that.
I'm going to my brother's house.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> It's been less than 24 hours since your ultimatum.<eos> I never wanted to be the guy that makes ultimatums.<eos> You know it's funny.<eos> You were coming home every night late, banged up all to hell, and I've never seen you happier.<eos> I don't want to be the one to take you away from that.<eos> You don't have to be.<eos> I also can't live knowing that every time I see you might be the last.<eos> I love you too much.
I am gone.<eos> Oh, you know, it's so funny, darling, 'cause I have that same negligee, but, of course, it's in a little tiger print, so it's<eos> Well, resume your lovemaking, darling.<eos> Oh! Hey, Ryan and Espo have caught a homicide.<eos> You want to join them?<eos> Why?<eos> Got a crime scene right here.<eos> My mother just killed the mood.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah, okay, baby. I'll call you later.
I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.<eos> What am I smelling?<eos> Oh, it's car air freshener.<eos> I was simulating the smell of the forest.<eos> That's not what the forest smells like.<eos> Well, how would I know?<eos> Why are you pretending to be outdoors?<eos> You hate it.<eos> Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.<eos> Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.
I can't believe Penny hasn't.<eos> Sheldon, what did you do?<eos> Well, I'm not proud of it, but... I jaywalked.<eos> Oh, no, it's like a horror movie.<eos> We're trapped in a cabin with a maniac.<eos> I'm surprised you would do that.<eos> No, I crossed in the middle of the street.<eos> And normally, I wouldn't, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season.<eos> Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.<eos> What-- he arrested you for that?
So you'd be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?<eos> If that's what you want to do, yes.<eos> Well, it's not what I want to do.<eos> Doesn't matter what I want.<eos> Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt.<eos> So I'm gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.<eos> Well, that is the grown-up thing.<eos> I guess.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Son of a bitch.<eos> Why is that funny?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I like the pain of others.<eos> Oh, well, then you'll enjoy this.<eos> Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> She defends him all the time.<eos> She does not.<eos> Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?
... messed up these days.<eos> Anyway, I just can't live like this anymore.<eos> Part of me is scared I'm gonna die.<eos> And part of me is scared I won't.<eos> That's all I got.<eos> Who else would like to share?<eos> I don't know about the rest of you, but I want to kick the crap out of that guy.<eos> Yeah, like a hundred pounds of you is gonna hurt somebody.<eos> Excuse me, but I have a beast mode you don't know about.<eos> What have I always told you?
No warning?<eos> "Ready, set, go" is for people I like.<eos> Pay at the counter.<eos> Just so you know... there is nothing that anybody could say to me that's worse than what I say to myself.<eos> For the rest of my life, I got to live with what I did.<eos> You didn't kill her.<eos> She used because she was an addict, and that's what addicts do.<eos> Do you think it is even possible for someone as messed up as me to stay sober?<eos> Come back to the meeting and... I'll introduce you to my mother.<eos> Hey. How do I know you're not faking the whole paralyzed thing so I'm always waiting on you?
She told me a lot of stories.<eos> One of you is really smart and kind and helps people all the time.<eos> Guilty.<eos> And somebody punched a camel?<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> I was super drunk, and he wouldn't give me a cigarette.<eos> Who cries all the time?<eos> Yeah, that's me!<eos> And she talked a lot about you, Christy.<eos> And how much she loved you and how you tried to stop her from going out with me.

I will be.<eos> Once we get to where we're going.<eos> Hey. I knew what I signed up for when I married you.<eos> Renee, I know you did, but the kids... the kids never had a choice.<eos> Mm-mm. Don't put all this on your shoulders.<eos> It isn't your fault.<eos> You're a good wife.<eos> I love you.<eos> I know.<eos> I love you, too.
you're a good boy.<eos> Look, it's all gonna be fine.<eos> I got a corkscrew, I got a toothpick.<eos> I got some scissors.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine, all right?<eos> Listen, you can do this.<eos> u cado ts. You're tougher than me.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> Ask the kids. They both know ared of you.<eos> I love you so much.
What do you think?<eos> What are you gonna do with an $80 million piece of hardware?<eos> I'm gonna wear it.<eos> You're gonna wear it? Okay. Yeah.<eos> Right? 'Cause this thing is, you know... it's completely McGarrett proof.<eos> It's been designed for your partner to wear.<eos> Oh, we're doing that.<eos> Mm. Still with that?<eos> Six years.<eos> Since the day I met you, you've been telling me I've been trying to kill you.
I'm just thinking about Adam.<eos> Adam had to run.<eos> He didn't have a choice.<eos> Come on, you know that, don't you?<eos> I do, and then my mind starts wandering into all that stuff with Gabriel and then I don't.<eos> Well, let me give you a little advice.<eos> Follow your first instinct.<eos> Your husband's a good guy.<eos> I know that and you know that, too, more importantly.<eos> He was protecting you by leaving you out of the loop, and now he's doing what he's got to do to stay alive and protecting himself.
Thank you.<eos> Keep the change.<eos> Oh, that was fun.<eos> Night's not over.<eos> Ooh, save it for the bedroom, cowboy.<eos> Or...<eos> Or what?<eos> Well, we still have the sitter for a half hour.<eos> Thought we'd give the hammock in the backyard a try.<eos> I am not taking you to the emergency room for a sex-related injury.
Not unless you're a gamer.<eos> Yeah, I created one of the fastest grossing mobile games of all time.<eos> We hit ten million downloads in the first month.<eos> Oh, wow, that's incredible.<eos> That's what Tim Cook said.<eos> But enough about me, what is it that you do?<eos> Um, I'm a model.<eos> I was just in Lanai doing a swimwear shoot.<eos> Ah. Swimwear, very cool.<eos> So, what brings you to Los Angeles today, Toast?
Maybe it's where he was planning on taking his victims.<eos> That's what I was afraid of.<eos> Check this out.<eos> That's a body.<eos> What is it?<eos> This is the fallout to his confession.<eos> What do you think, he was making Putnam watch it?<eos> That's exactly what I think.<eos> And then he left him locked up in here with only one way out.<eos> Thought we had lost you there, cuz.
And then he left him locked up in here with only one way out.<eos> Thought we had lost you there, cuz.<eos> Get off me.<eos> What happened?<eos> You don't remember?<eos> We were just floating out there on that life raft.<eos> And I spotted land.<eos> That's right.<eos> You were so excited, you jumped up and lost your balance.<eos> By the time we got you back in the raft, you had swallowed so much water, that you passed out.
You actually should be flattered.<eos> Out of all the women I could have chosen as my muse, I chose you.<eos> I'm honored.<eos> Deeply.<eos> The sketch artist is on her way.<eos> A sketch artist?<eos> What for?<eos> So you can give a description.<eos> Of the murder suspect.<eos> The same one that put you in the emergency room.
We're on our way.<eos> Hold your position.<eos> Make sure no one gets out of the building.<eos> What about the girl?<eos> Get rid of her.<eos> Still no word from Abby.<eos> We gotta go back.<eos> I wouldn't worry too much about her, Chin.<eos> I'm sure she's fine.<eos> Hey, what'd I tell you about talking?
Jerry, you there?<eos> Like Al in Die Hard, buddy.<eos> Just hang a left on Fort Street Mall and head toward Beretenia.<eos> Path's all clear.<eos> My office said you needed to see me.<eos> You got five minutes.<eos> We think Michelle Shioma has a mole inside HPD.<eos> I need to know if you're looking at anyone connected to her.<eos> So it's "we" now?<eos> I sent you in there to help me take them down, Abby, not become one of them.
When they activate it, everyone in Old Town becomes some kind of helpless, happy drone.<eos> The Company can do whatever they want to them.<eos> This is all bad.<eos> Seyah Kendry sends her regards.<eos> You poisoned the rations.<eos> You're gonna kill all the weak and leave the strong.<eos> And then what?<eos> Don't leave me hanging.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I'm pretty sure that we're gonna stop you.
Are these your database libraries?<eos> They're so exposed.<eos> That's really not appropriate.<eos> Oh... oh, dear.<eos> Pawter, hot damn, we're in.<eos> Lucy got you access to the mood controls... try again.<eos> Okay, slide all the levels to zero.<eos> That should put the mood control to neutral.<eos> Done.<eos> They can listen to you now, so tell them to stop eating those damn rations and stay away from the wall, because it's still powered and lethal.
Thank you, Doctor Pawter, for freeing Old Town.<eos> If you're sure, Seyah Simms.<eos> Oh, Pretty-Pawter...<eos> - No, no, no, no, no! - Kill them all.<eos> Pawter... you're fine, you're fine.<eos> Oh, shit, shit.<eos> Hey, it's okay, it's okay.<eos> Pawter, you need to tell me what to do, okay?<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Tell me how to help you, okay?
I'm keeping the five.<eos> You were a part of our family.<eos> We trusted you.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> How could you lie to me?<eos> I never meant to hurt you, Elena.<eos> You came after my family.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Car bomb.<eos> Was it your idea, or did David put you put to it?
Okay, bye, Randy!<eos> Honey, hi.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I've got a meeting about doing sports for WNY-8.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> You talking on camera, that's so...<eos> Great?<eos> Great, yes. Oh!<eos> Oh, crap. I forgot to tell Ben that Sam called.<eos> I'm sorry, Sam called you?
Honey, hi.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I've got a meeting about doing sports for WNY-8.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> You talking on camera, that's so...<eos> Great?<eos> Great, yes. Oh!<eos> Oh, crap. I forgot to tell Ben that Sam called.<eos> I'm sorry, Sam called you?<eos> Why did Sam call you?
It's not as scary as it looks.<eos> So, this is Liz.<eos> Hi, Tasha, that's a lovely name.<eos> So is it... it's short for Natasha?<eos> - Oh, and Boomer.<eos> How old are you?<eos> - I'm 18.<eos> - Oh. Tasha's from the west, north of Broome.<eos> Oh, that's lovely.<eos> So, what brought you all the way over here?
Oh, good for you.<eos> Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and Jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.<eos> No HoneyBaked Ham in a hot tub-- got it.<eos> Oh, no bubble baths either.<eos> They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.<eos> Okay, have fun.<eos> Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.<eos> We're leaving now!<eos> Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes...<eos> Okay, we're leaving, love you, bye!
I could line them up, categorize them, control them.<eos> I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn't.<eos> That's lovely, Sheldon.<eos> Well... other than when they're chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.<eos> I have to admit, I've been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Why didn't you say something?<eos> Same reason I don't talk about ass cancer.<eos> It's not a pleasant topic.<eos> You can't let this stop you.
Oh, thanks! You're a peach!<eos> Beverly, we'll catch up soon.<eos> Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always,<eos> Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.<eos> How long have I had spinach in my teeth?<eos> Since the airport, dear.<eos> You look like you come with a kickstand.<eos> You can't make me feel bad.<eos> Hmm, maybe not.<eos> So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?
I'm going to think about your new rates, Mr Mandeville, as well as what you just told me.<eos> Come in.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> What?<eos> You kept our parents' apartment.<eos> They wanted me to keep it so you'd have a home when you came out.<eos> What did I do?<eos> What did I do, Eddy?<eos> Want a coffee?<eos> I left an envelope for you in the hallway.
Thank you.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> What are you doing here, Roxanne?<eos> When I spoke to Eddy on the phone earlier, he didn't mention you.<eos> I could tell you were uncomfortable.<eos> All right, you caught me.<eos> Okay, why are you here, Roxanne?<eos> I wanted to know what Eddy was hiding from me.<eos> Are you the one that Vogel nearly killed?<eos> I'm happy to have helped you out.
After 15 years in prison, a few miles' walk is a blessing.<eos> Have you got any plans?<eos> Find work.<eos> I won't have rent but I'll have bills and I want to pay them.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> I don't want your help, Eddy. Nor your pity.<eos> I used to have a job, I'll find another one.<eos> I need to be persistent.<eos> I'm not treating you like a charity case.<eos> Dad left some money for you as well as the apartment.
-About me.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> First, because you asked me not to, and also, if you won't tell him, it means you don't love him.<eos> The day you tell him, that's when I need to be worried.<eos> See? Not so dumb.<eos> I believe you.<eos> What do you use this car for?<eos> Deals, drug runs?<eos> I can't say.<eos> -Who's texting you? -My appointment.
You might want to j...<eos> Let me start by saying, that at some point in your life, you're going to make this mistake.<eos> Well, maybe not this exact mistake, but especially in relationships, everyone has decisions they wish they could take back.<eos> Cooper, to celebrate our one month anniversary, I just sent you a little picture.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> I'll take that as a yes.<eos> Now you have to send me something.<eos> Uh, Lena, I don't know if that's a good idea.<eos> FYI... the next pic I want to send you incorporates my gymnastics background.
- Can I sit right here?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Ah, we're on a date.<eos> - Morning, man.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Hey, did you get a chance to talk to Lena?<eos> Uh, yes, actually, I did.<eos> Uh, I met her out for a couple of drinks.<eos> In fact, she deleted all of the pictures off her hard drive right in front of me.<eos> I could kiss you, and that's a real offer this time.
You could have sent anyone, but here you are... an Alpha all alone.<eos> This is personal for me.<eos> Oh, it is personal for me, but why is it for you?<eos> Do you remember that woman you stabbed?<eos> The one with the gun.<eos> What about her?<eos> I had to kill her.<eos> So? What does it matter?<eos> She was a nosy human.<eos> You are here because I inconvenienced you?
If you want me to.<eos> (RUSTLING)<eos> Look who showed up.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Just mulching a little bit. I see that.<eos> Looking good out here.<eos> Not like when you cut trees back. Don't think time of year matters with mulch, though I'm sure some TV guy would tell me different.<eos> Well, I need to do some of that myself, now that I think about it.<eos> Well, if I got any left, you're welcome to it.<eos> So, what brings you by?
Seriously, when I came to, I asked why I fainted.<eos> When they told me a second time, I fainted again.<eos> TED SR.: Still soaking.<eos> You'll get all wrinkly.<eos> I'm already wrinkly.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> I guess.<eos> That's the one area you can't reach yourself, i'nt it? Nope.<eos> It does.<eos> I love you, too, Janet.
- Mark, calm yourself.<eos> - I'm not a dog. I'm not eating that shit.<eos> I refuse. Calm down, Mark, or you'll be restrained.<eos> What did you say to me?<eos> You called me a homosexual!<eos> - I didn't call you anything!<eos> - You called me a homosexual!<eos> We all need love and we all need nurture.<eos> There's too much death and destruction.<eos> But friends who love you should... ..warm you like the sun.
I just got an e-mail notification that our first wedding gift has arrived.<eos> Oh, y-you did?<eos> Spoiler alert,<eos> - it's a bread maker.<eos> - Bread maker.<eos> Cece, do me a favor and bring it inside.<eos> It's in the hallway right now.<eos> Yeah, I'll-I'll go...<eos> I'll go get the... the bread maker and bring it inside, in one piece, safe and sound.<eos> I love you so much, I got to go.
It's like... just like a... a little baby meteorologist.<eos> Hey, so, it's this simple, okay.<eos> We wanted to pay for the bread maker, but they wouldn't let us pay for it because it was a floor model, so we had a plan...<eos> I don't care.<eos> Baby in a raincoat.<eos> This is bad, you guys. This is really bad!<eos> He's gonna call the real cops and I'm gonna be in so much trouble.<eos> I could lose my job... or worse...<eos> They put me on train duty.<eos> I'm so sorry we got you in this situation, okay.
You're... you're here.<eos> Uh, guys, you...<eos> - you ready?<eos> - Winston.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait.<eos> - No... no.<eos> - Mm-mm, no.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> - ♪ I know this world ♪ - Aly, um, look, I really like you,<eos> You, oh look, I know you just broke up with your boyfriend, - ♪ Alison ♪ - but... whenever you're ready, I'd like to take you on a date.
Wait, your mom escaped Hell?<eos> Yes.<eos> Funny timing, isn't it?<eos> She slipped out whilst Amenadiel was injured.<eos> And you, uh...<eos> Well, where were you, Maze?<eos> Wait, you think I'm helping her?<eos> Have you forgotten who actually tortured her in Hell?<eos> Well, desperation makes for strange bedfellows.<eos> I've just pictured you in bed with my mom.
- but, yeah, flamingos...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Morningstar.<eos> Hello, murderer.<eos> Murderer?<eos> I don't... I don't understand.<eos> Oh, Roberta, can we skip the boring part where you deny it and just, uh...<eos> Let's get to the good stuff, shall we?<eos> Does it help if I call you Bobby B.?
Let me just finish this text to my daughter.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> You two are talking again?<eos> Yes, we're talking.<eos> Sorry, last I heard you were dead to her.<eos> Yeah, well, I apologized for something I didn't do, and now we're good again.<eos> She wants to go wedding dress shopping tomorrow.<eos> Wow, and she invited you to go with her?<eos> That's right, I am buying the dress.<eos> Oh, well, that explains why she invited you.
Really?<eos> I haven't done that since I drank.<eos> Weird waking up in a bed that doesn't have a strange guy in it, huh?<eos> How's my patient doing?<eos> Oh, good, Wendy.<eos> How long am I gonna be here?<eos> I have finals tomorrow.<eos> You can forget about that.<eos> You're a very sick girl.<eos> And you, what'd I tell you about the mask?
Well, promise me you'll be careful.<eos> I will.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I owe you.<eos> Christy, wait!<eos> I'm a little low on gas.<eos> You mind filling it up on your way back?<eos> Sure.<eos> A wash if you have the time!<eos> (car alarm chirps) Okay. I hear you.
He's checking in to see how we're doing.<eos> Oh, sweet.<eos> Here he is with all his stuntman buddies.<eos> Oh, that's a lot of tank tops.<eos> (chuckles) Adam seems like a good guy.<eos> He is.<eos> You thinking of telling him you love him, too?<eos> I'm thinking about it, but I'm scared.<eos> Oh, Bonnie, of what?<eos> He's already said he loves you.
Oh, sweet.<eos> Here he is with all his stuntman buddies.<eos> Oh, that's a lot of tank tops.<eos> (chuckles) Adam seems like a good guy.<eos> He is.<eos> You thinking of telling him you love him, too?<eos> I'm thinking about it, but I'm scared.<eos> Oh, Bonnie, of what?<eos> He's already said he loves you.<eos> Well, technically, he said "love you."
You know how it is when these players come out of college.<eos> They're going through a lot of stress.<eos> I'm helping him with that transition.<eos> - Like a mentor.<eos> - You're a really good person.<eos> Just doing this out of the kindness of your heart.<eos> - I like it. - Till I get my registration.<eos> I got to keep a little safe distance.<eos> - Come on, you know the game.<eos> - Yeah, I do. That's why you help him, he helps me, I help you.
Let's not forget that I advised you to invest $600,000, not $6 million into this deal.<eos> And if that deal would have panned out, you would have made very good money, okay?<eos> And if it failed, which it did, you still would have had over $5 million to put into another opportunity.<eos> But only a crazy man puts all of his money into one single deal!<eos> Yes, and only an asshole would let him.<eos> Even I didn't have the power to stop you back then.<eos> I mean, you wouldn't even listen to your coach. You were gonna listen to me?<eos> You knew I had a player's mentality back then and you also knew, Andre, if everything went south, like this whole fucking deal went south, I wasn't gonna back out. That's not how I thought back then.<eos> No, I was gonna dig in even fucking deeper.<eos> Did I tell you to bring all those people into the deal, including your friends?
you trust him with your life.<eos> You're gonna recommend him.<eos> That's not gonna work, man.<eos> Dae Won's gonna know something's up-- what do I tell him?<eos> Why don't you tell him you can't fly?<eos> And why's that?<eos> You broke my arm!<eos> Well, the good news is you don't have to lie now.<eos> Hey, Nate.<eos> This is the guy I was telling you about.
You know, he was there for me, like, when my father died,<eos> John McGarrett was there for me.<eos> Two times in my life, I really needed a friend... and both times that friend was named McGarrett.<eos> They're gonna be okay.<eos> Thank you, Doc.<eos> Hey, boss.<eos> Why is it that people never say what they want to say until something like this happens?<eos> The day I met you... six years ago, at Waimea Bay... you changed my life.<eos> You gave me more than just a job... you gave me a family.<eos> And I never told you how much I appreciate it all.
No, I don't want any friggin' cracklins, braheem!<eos> You know, I was wondering if it ever crossed your mind to consult with me first.<eos> You know, I'm guessing it didn't, Tandy.<eos> Did it?<eos> I found this bacon.<eos> - We ran this by the group...<eos> - Yeah. And everyone agreed that Mike should get to finish off the bacon, 'cause he hasn't had any yet.<eos> Everyone?<eos> That's funny, 'cause last time I checked, I was part and parcel of "everyone."<eos> We looked for you everywhere, and we couldn't find you, bud.
What did you promise me?<eos> Am I suppose to move this month?<eos> I lived here long enough.<eos> Look at my neighbors.<eos> You keep saying the same thing.<eos> It's pointless.<eos> I'm pointless?<eos> Then find somebody else.<eos> Hey, Lulu!<eos> The crazy guy living next door I've told you about?
After Mom passed away, I couldn't get a hold of anyone.<eos> I'm so lonely.<eos> My place will be demolished soon.<eos> I'm begging you, come meet me.<eos> I need to talk to you about something.<eos> In loving memory of my Father<eos> You're doing so well now.<eos> Married to a beautiful wife.<eos> To see your parents, they must be happy watching you from heaven.<eos> Did my brother contact you?
Sweetie!<eos> Sweetie!<eos> Calling headquarters!<eos> Call the police!<eos> There's an intruder.<eos> Call the ambulance! Hurry!<eos> Don't hit my daddy!<eos> Come out!<eos> Come out!<eos> Who let you in my house?
He is gone.<eos> He won't come back, right?<eos> He won't.<eos> Don't worry!<eos> Have you lost it?<eos> Somebody stop him!<eos> Shut up or I'll finish him off...<eos> Stay away...<eos> Leave us alone!<eos> What did she tell you about me?
- That's all she said?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Then she's said nothing.<eos> You're senior to me...<eos> Doesn't affect me...<eos> And yet you call me 'sir'?<eos> That sort of politeness is too cute for my taste.<eos> Your kid is such a cry baby...<eos> Been pampered a lot, eh?<eos> Mommy walks you to school, walks you back home...
She's not looking for a strong husband.<eos> That... no, tha-that's not what I was gonna...<eos> That's not where I was going with this.<eos> I'm getting married, Nick.<eos> How am I going to defend Cece?<eos> She deserves the best husband in the world, and what if I don't have what it takes?<eos> Of course you have what it takes to be a modern husband.<eos> Do you have what it takes to be a husband of the old world?<eos> God, no.<eos> They would use you as a pelt.
I'm going.<eos> Hello, Harvey.<eos> Long time.<eos> Hey, Fish.<eos> How you doing?<eos> - Not so good.<eos> - Sorry to hear that.<eos> You know, there's a lot of people out there looking for you.<eos> I need to find that bastard, Strange.<eos> Yeah, well, you know I can't help you with that.
Kill them now!<eos> Stay back!<eos> Jim, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Saving you;<eos> I thought that was obvious.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Totally.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why are you here, Gordon?<eos> Did your little cop friend send you to get me to turn myself in?
Here you are.<eos> Press that hard against your nose.<eos> All right?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Stem the flow.<eos> Good lad.<eos> Well, that's a very nasty scar.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Or can't you remember?<eos> What did they do to you in there?
- He cut his hair. - To look more like you.<eos> Does Alfred know you have his car?<eos> Would you like to go for a ride?<eos> The ticking synchronizes with your heartbeat.<eos> Deep down, you want to die, Jim.<eos> Step off the ledge.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> My-my brother will find out I'm here, and he'll come for me.<eos> Nothing will stop him.<eos> This is the brother that took you to Strange to try and fix you?
That's in the Narrows. So I suppose we should be thankful there's anything left to tow.<eos> Fmillfliéifiq=I=lliafilifl1+z What in the dickens was he doing down there in the first place?<eos> 11th and Dillon is near her apartment.<eos> Sorry, again, for the way I acted when you came by yesterday.<eos> Any word on your friend Ivy?<eos> I even braved a beat-down from Sonny to see if she was growing magic mushrooms for him again.<eos> Magic what?<eos> Mushrooms.<eos> Sonny Gilzean.<eos> Pounded you to within an inch of your life.
A fine figure of a woman.<eos> She was my whole world.<eos> The only one that was always there for me.<eos> Well, I believe the answer is yes.<eos> She would be proud.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> Oswald, look at everything you've achieved.<eos> The people love you.<eos> Gangs fear you.<eos> And tomorrow night, the crÃ¨me of Gotham will be gathering to celebrate you.
Need a hand, kitten?<eos> I got it.<eos> Hold on, Butch.<eos> Sir, the ambulance carrying Butch Gilzean was just hijacked.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Put out a BOLO.<eos> I'll call the mayor.<eos> M-M-Mister, please.<eos> My dear, sweet sister.<eos> Just look... at what he did to you.
- I love you.<eos> - You're insane!<eos> No! You killed her!<eos> She died, he escaped.<eos> 'Cause I heard a rumor there's something strange about her blood.<eos> I'll tell you what you want to know.<eos> You are gonna have to buy me dinner, though.<eos> He killed you.<eos> Those who hurt you will feel my pain.<eos> I love you, Daddy.
What is important is that I have found someone.<eos> What good is love if it's one-sided?<eos> I have no choice but to confess my feelings to Ed.<eos> Now that, I understand.<eos> It means yes.<eos> My mother taught me that. She used to tell me,<eos> "Life only gives you one true love, Oswald.<eos> When you find it, run to it."<eos> So that is what I'm going to do.<eos> I'm also going to enroll you in an ESL program.
Good morning, Mayor Cobblepot.<eos> Good morning to you, my chief of staff.<eos> Here are your schedules for the day.<eos> This covers your duties as mayor, and this as kingpin of the underworld.<eos> You really are settling into your role here, aren't you, Ed?<eos> And yet I still have so much to learn from you.<eos> I came up empty tracking down Butch.<eos> Somehow that one-handed ape managed to disappear.<eos> I suspect he's hiding with his old crew.<eos> I'm sorry for letting you down.
Get the hell off my crime scene before I throw you ass in lockup.<eos> Biehl, Alban, escort Mr. Gordon off of the premises.<eos> If he resists, book him for obstruction.<eos> I'll go on my own.<eos> Uh-uh! No.<eos> I see that look in your eye.<eos> Do not try to solve this by yourself.<eos> Then help me.<eos> If Tetch has Alice's blood, we don't have much time.<eos> No, I'm not gonna aid you on one of your solo, bullcrap, kamikaze missions anymore!
I came by to bring this to... Vale.<eos> I got to get back to the ER.<eos> He's angry.<eos> I get that.<eos> He has every reason to be.<eos> I figured you'd be out chasing down Tetch.<eos> Barnes banned me.<eos> No badge.<eos> No investigation.<eos> That's never stopped you before.
I'll get him tomorrow.<eos> Promise.<eos> My father and I haven't always seen eye to eye.<eos> But I think, Dad, you'll agree that... marrying Lee is the best decision I've ever made.<eos> Without a doubt.<eos> And Lee.<eos> You're a doctor, a member of our city's police department.<eos> You're funny, compassionate and brilliant.<eos> Despite insisting all dogs are boys and all cats are girls... it's hopeless, I've tried to correct her...<eos> I've loved you since the moment I saw you.
Of course.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's far enough.<eos> I know what you're thinking, Jim.<eos> You're thinking,<eos> "Why would Captain Nathaniel Barnes, "Mr. By-the-book, blow a hole "in this unarmed scumbag?<eos> Could it be that he actually killed Symon, too?"<eos> You see, I know that you've been investigating me, Jim.<eos> - Did you kill Symon?<eos> - Is that what he told you?
Only question is... where do you stand?<eos> Against you.<eos> Well, I'm disappointed.<eos> Good-bye, Jim.<eos> Hey, Sugar!<eos> I got a... Whoa!<eos> The time I knew you feels like a dream.<eos> And now I'm awake.<eos> I wish I'd gone on sleeping.<eos> I will never forget you, my love.
Do you?<eos> The other assassin.<eos> You want to tell me what happened in the store?<eos> There's nothing to tell.<eos> He came after me, I did what I needed to do.<eos> You called her?<eos> She deserves to know what's going on.<eos> Either you tell her or I will.<eos> Come on.<eos> I think I know who sent you.
Someone else is infected with your sister's blood.<eos> You don't say.<eos> And I've been thinking it's possible she infected them accidentally.<eos> Yes, possible. Possible.<eos> But your reaction tells me you knew.<eos> So... you infected them after you stole your sister's blood, but you stayed quiet, waiting for them to show symptoms.<eos> Well, that would be darn sneaky of me, wouldn't it?<eos> I need the name.<eos> You need the name.<eos> So... I've been quiet about it all this time, and now I'm going to help you because we're such good friends?
You telling Tetch to shoot his fiancée.<eos> You should've seen his face when those assassins attacked us... his rage.<eos> He was being attacked by assassins!<eos> What was I supposed to do, Harvey, wait until he kills again, till he hurts Lee?<eos> You were supposed to wait until you had enough proof.<eos> And why would Tetch infect Mario in the first place?<eos> To hurt me.<eos> Okay, let's say you're right.<eos> Let's say that Mario is infected.<eos> So he crushes some guy's skull, he breaks into the lab, he attacks you, and then he writes "Arkham" on your hand?
What dark part of me has it brought to life?<eos> Jealousy.<eos> You're afraid of losing Lee.<eos> If that's true... that means the woman we both know you still love is gonna marry a lunatic who'll do anything to keep her.<eos> Are you sure you don't want that drink?<eos> What I want to know is why you put me on your trail.<eos> What are you after?<eos> Let me give you a hint.<eos> You see, what keeps me up at night is not the thought that you love her.<eos> It's the thought... that a part of her still loves you.
Sorry, Jim.<eos> But, hey, give the bride a kiss for me.<eos> I asked.<eos> And it is with great pleasure that I present this award to Mr. Kyle Davis for his magnificent book,<eos> Gotham Sewers: an Oral History.<eos> Looks just fascinating.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, you're too kind.<eos> I love sewers.<eos> I was worried when you ran off that I might have upset you.
I say this as someone who cares about you.<eos> Get help.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I've never stopped.<eos> I should've come to see you as soon as I got out of prison, but I couldn't.<eos> I was ashamed.<eos> I thought I had to set things right.<eos> But I did finally come,<eos> I saw you, through the window, with him.
The Flash, of all the people, you're setting me up.<eos> - The hero.<eos> - You're insane.<eos> The great hero!<eos> I want my phone call, when do I get my phone call?<eos> - Hey. How you feeling?<eos> Not too bad for a guy that got beat up by a myth.<eos> - Yeah? - You stopped him.<eos> Well done, Barry.<eos> It was nice, having you out there with me.
Hey. What's up?<eos> It's Wally.<eos> I don't get it, Bar, it's like his brain goes to sleep and somebody else is at the wheel.<eos> Have you been losing time?<eos> Blacking out?<eos> Hours passing, waking up somewhere different? Not being sure of how you got there.<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> No! I've had enough of these baseless accusations and ridiculous theories of yours.<eos> Julian, I'm trying to help you!
Okay, I need an anti-psychotic.<eos> Caitlin!<eos> If you leave, I'm gonna have to leave, too.<eos> So you're telling me that... that every time I'm blacking out...<eos> You've become Alchemy.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Alchemy is a monster, he's been terrorizing people for years.<eos> Look, it's not you.<eos> Just like it wasn't you back on that dig.<eos> I know that this is hard to believe, but you have to start accepting what's happening to you.
I think it's Savitar speaking through you.<eos> Savitar clearly possesses someone who rallies worshippers.<eos> But he's like a poltergeist, he needs a medium to manifest himself.<eos> You.<eos> Right, but what does that mean?<eos> We think we figured out a way to sync your brain to the stone.<eos> And it'll allow us to speak directly to Savitar.<eos> I thought...<eos> If you want to try to be free of this, you need to trust us.<eos> - I've never liked you, Allen. - Yeah.
Pete'll be back soon.<eos> I should get back to work.<eos> No, you should do everything I say.<eos> Just answer one more question for me.<eos> What's the worst thing you've ever done?<eos> I murdered one of those wives I told you about.<eos> Made it look like an accident.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Oh, damn.<eos> I was rooting for you, Lou.
Our story is your story, Stefan.<eos> So now here's the test.<eos> Which girl are you?<eos> So, uh, what do you think?<eos> I think it's a hood ornament, Pete.<eos> Vintage Rolls-Royce.<eos> Aah! I also think that you're in danger of losing a real life.<eos> I'm doing what you asked.<eos> Oh, are you?<eos> I compelled you to find what I needed.
I always thought you were a bastard.<eos> Shut up, I'm done playing games.<eos> Well, Tyler Lockwood is gonna be very sad to hear that.<eos> Because if you don't play along, he dies.<eos> Maybe you care about that?<eos> Not even you're that stupid.<eos> Humanity or not, nobody'd forgive you for that.<eos> Especially Elena.<eos> Well, that's the whole point, you idiot.<eos> Apparently, you've been out of the loop for a while, Matt, so allow me to bring you up to speed.
Now. Why, so you can go warn Alaric?<eos> You're assuming that I'm gonna let you remember this when you wake up.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Orders from above.<eos> Well, below.<eos> What did you do to me?<eos> You tell me.<eos> What do you remember?<eos> You confronted your sister.<eos> She turned you into a cannibal against your wishes.
The people he loved damned him.<eos> And only at the very end did he finally give up on them, only when the smell of his burning flesh was searing his nostrils, did he see them for what they really were.<eos> Monsters.<eos> Just like you and me.<eos> So, Cade damned them in return.<eos> With his last breath, he let loose a psychic blast so powerful that it created its own world.<eos> Call it hell if you want.<eos> It doesn't matter what name you give it or whether you believe in it or not.<eos> Either way, that is where Cade feeds on the souls of the damned.<eos> It's where he waits for you, Stefan.
Damon's fate is already sealed.<eos> I reached into his mind and gave him a look at what awaits him, and even that little spoonful was enough to make him flip his little humanity switch.<eos> He chose to serve Cade for all eternity, rather than experience another second in that kind of torment.<eos> Damon believes in hell.<eos> And soon you will, too.<eos> Because you're just as doomed as he is.<eos> So Mystic Falls is overrun with supernatural creatures, and... vampires are real.<eos> They feed on human blood and can even control people if they want to.<eos> Okay, so why couldn't Damon compel me, then?<eos> It's because of that watch I gave you.
They feed on human blood and can even control people if they want to.<eos> Okay, so why couldn't Damon compel me, then?<eos> It's because of that watch I gave you.<eos> It's full of something called vervain.<eos> A glass of vervain every day keeps the vampires at bay.<eos> Yeah. How'd you know that?<eos> Something your great-grandmother used to say when she was making tea.<eos> She was senile at the end, and... leaving her behind, that was the hardest part about leaving Mystic Falls.<eos> Look,<eos> Matt, I don't expect you to forgive me for abandoning you.
Let me do this.<eos> Ah! The intern.<eos> Where is my sister?<eos> I tried.<eos> I tried to free the girl in the cell, just like you asked.<eos> And?<eos> And, um, she told me to tell you to piss off.<eos> She doesn't need your help.<eos> Well. I tried.<eos> Look, I'm sorry to have to involve you in this, sweetie.
Okay, well, I'm a complicated person.<eos> In my 140 years on this Earth, - no one's figured me out.<eos> - Oh, well. Guess I'll die trying.<eos> Oh. You think I'm afraid of fire because Damon left me in a fire.<eos> Nice try.<eos> But no.<eos> You're afraid of people leaving.<eos> Period.<eos> You're afraid of being abandoned.<eos> The one thing that happens to you again and again.
Yeah, in hindsight, that might have been a bit dramatic.<eos> Well, it's a little late to take it back.<eos> Even if Sybil made you do it.<eos> Yeah, see, this is where it gets tricky.<eos> I want to serve her, Stefan, I mean, I have to.<eos> And serving her keeps me away from the big bad devil himself.<eos> And I want to stay away from hell as long as humanly possible.<eos> - By turning off your humanity?<eos> - There are worse fates.<eos> You know I can help you.
Well...<eos> Yeah. That's what I thought.<eos> I was angry.<eos> But humans weren't the reason your father and I were fighting.<eos> At least, not then.<eos> Uh, mum?<eos> I think you left out a minor detail.<eos> liar, liar, slutty dress on fire, mother.<eos> Whoever destroyed my human suit must have killed this little imp as well; it's obvious.<eos> lucifer, honey, why would I bring you here just to disprove my story?
This line of questioning is now over.<eos> Why don't you go speak to my attorney.<eos> He's two doors down.<eos> Why would you divulge privileged information to a guy who's now clearly our lead suspect?<eos> Sorry. I'll get that protocol thing down one day.<eos> why aren't you dead? What? Who are you?<eos> Don't give me that, charlotte.<eos> By the way, thanks for using the credit card we opened for the perez case.<eos> Did you forget I'm the only one that has access to it?<eos> That I'm the only one who did anything for you at that hellhole? Hellhole?
I want my home back.<eos> But I know that's not possible.<eos> So I want to do what I can to be a good mother to you here, on earth.<eos> It's too late.<eos> You abandoned me, mum.<eos> You just stood by and watched as I was cast out.<eos> Thrown into hell and vilified for all eternity.<eos> There aren't enough cheesy noodles in the universe to fix all that, I'm afraid.<eos> Okay.<eos> your father never sent you to hell.
Existing in this punishment allows me to be closer to my family.<eos> You made a deal to return Mom to Hell.<eos> In exchange, Chloe's life was spared.<eos> You still haven't delivered on your end of the bargain.<eos> If you're so concerned, why don't you just fly Mum back to Hell?<eos> Because I can't!<eos> What if Dad decides to... take back his side of the deal?<eos> Son of a biscuit!<eos> Dylan!<eos> How many times have I told you to pick up that stupid skateboard!
Come here.<eos> What's going on, kiddo?<eos> Landa says your job's really dangerous.<eos> That cops get hurt all the time.<eos> I don't want you to get hurt.<eos> The car accident was just that... an accident.<eos> And Mommy's job can be dangerous, but I'm really careful, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna get hurt.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> Oh, I love you so much.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'll return home.<eos> You know what?<eos> Something's bothering me.<eos> I knew it.<eos> "Fury of God"<eos> doesn't usually talk so much.<eos> More a man of action.<eos> Amenadiel, at full strength, I could never beat this easily.<eos> Something's happened to you.
Last chance.<eos> You choose.<eos> Very well.<eos> Well, you didn't see that coming, did you?<eos> Actually, I did see it coming.<eos> I mean, I knew you were gonna attack.<eos> I just wasn't sure how.<eos> Patterns are tricky like that.<eos> Takes time to get a real sense of them.<eos> I needed to study you a bit.
I mean, why do you think I'm doing all this Dan-ing?<eos> Yet, you know, I'm still no closer to figuring out your secret.<eos> - Because I don't have a secret.<eos> - Well, you must.<eos> One that explains how you're able to be so... you know, frustratingly you.<eos> - You see, man... - Hmm?<eos> I try to compliment you, and...<eos> I think my father's death was a hit.<eos> I-It sounds like he stumbled onto something huge, and-and someone took him out for it.<eos> Chloe, do you want me to help you with this?
Let's go.<eos> All right, let's go. Let's go, man.<eos> It's not like you to get in the way of a good eviscerating, Maze.<eos> What was that about?<eos> You'd be eviscerating the wrong person.<eos> This is your mother's doing.<eos> Mum?<eos> How?<eos> You told her you want to stay here on Earth.<eos> Now someone's trying to take Lux away from you.
Trust me, you don't want to do that.<eos> But I can't let you kill Chloe, Mom.<eos> Since when can you...<eos> I tried to warn you.<eos> Apparently, paltry human flesh can't contain my divinity.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Bomb's in the car.<eos> So exciting.<eos> Mom, stop!<eos> I am trying to help you.
- critic when it comes to music, so...<eos> - Are you?<eos> Are you sure you want that to be our first date?<eos> I'm cool if you're cool.<eos> Are you cool?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll get at you.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, suki suki.<eos> He's taking you to that new club called The Cooper out there in Washington Heights.
'Cause he don't know you like I do.<eos> He don't know where you come from.<eos> He don't know what your drive is.<eos> Well, what he is is a good man, Lucious.<eos> A man who will lift his woman up, instead of drag her through every kind of hell.<eos> Look, it's true.<eos> I don't know him.<eos> All I know is he's got a string of socialites that he dates.<eos> And I wonder why he's dating you.<eos> Did he tell you that he put in a bid to run for mayor?
State of New York got something different to say about that.<eos> No, no, what did your lawyer say?<eos> The lawyer Lucious sent?<eos> He don't care about me, man.<eos> Lucious sent that man in here to make sure I kept my mouth shut about certain things.<eos> But I'm not no snitch, so...<eos> I'm gonna fix this.<eos> I am.<eos> It's all good.<eos> I belong here for what I did to you.
I don't think so.<eos> Oh, it's gonna be a tough needle to thread.<eos> Uh, I tell you what,<eos> Gabrielle Gerard, she's the best attorney in New York dealing with this type of stuff.<eos> I'm-a link you two.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> QuickBooks?<eos> Excel.<eos> Listen, uh, the only reason I let you in here is because I figured it was important for you to see what I'm about.
So you should know, Nessa, the deal Empire's offering is the best you're gonna get.<eos> There's a sizeable advance, the royalty rate's on the high end of reasonable, and you get to keep the income stream from merch and publishing.<eos> It's not that different from the other labels.<eos> You really want to sign with Tommy Davoni?<eos> Or some Dutch-owned conglomerate, really?<eos> So this is a black thing now?<eos> One thing this country's gonna make sure you remember, little sister, it's always a black thing.<eos> Listen, why are you here?<eos> Talking to me like this one-on-one?<eos> Shine is exploiting you, Nessa.

Thanks.<eos> You don't think I'm nice?<eos> Do you think you're nice?<eos> Well, I'm nice to you.<eos> Trevor.<eos> Trevor?<eos> Please stop.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Are you even listening to me?<eos> Who's texting you?

You can't tell me we didn't just do a good thing!<eos> It's not up to us!<eos> A boy almost died.<eos> Yeah! I know that!<eos> And we saved him.<eos> I'm not ashamed of that.<eos> We don't get to decide.<eos> Every change we make has the potential to alter the future.<eos> Isn't that what we're here to do?<eos> The FBI found you in one day, Philip!
Why are you being so mean to me?<eos> My whole life is falling apart.<eos> Don't let her play you.<eos> Your life is falling apart 'cause you're stupid!<eos> Yes! You need to move out of the problem, and into the solution.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> It means stop feeling sorry for yourself and get on with your life.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - What?<eos> I love you so much right now.

2nd try, his leg will be cut.<eos> After a 3rd attempt, he will be punished by death.<eos> The commander rings a bell at daybreak.<eos> But if the day is short, you get up at night.<eos> You then proceed to what is called mass.<eos> A kind of prayer for their God.<eos> then you leave for work.<eos> We each have a plot.<eos> You grow whatever you like.<eos> Whatever you reap belongs to you.
You did something stupid. I did too.<eos> Let's talk about it.<eos> We'll get through it.<eos> Let's not chuck it all.<eos> It's pathetic, clinging on like this.<eos> You only forgive me because you're scared of losing me.<eos> Our relationship is empty.<eos> The promises we made, the secrets we shared,<eos> the nights we spent together, they meant nothing to me.<eos> Because I've never loved you.
I'll be fine.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's the only room available in the area.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> Off you go.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Hi.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Fine.<eos> I've put you in room... 12.
Corbet used his debit card yesterday in a bar.<eos> We showed his picture in hotels. He's in the interview room.<eos> How's Franckie doing?<eos> - Hello.<eos> - We haven't seen you in a while.<eos> You know why you're here?<eos> No idea?<eos> No?<eos> Let me tell you.<eos> We have a problem: we found a corpse in the woods and 8,000 euros that belong to you.
I know, but the dough was for him.<eos> And that stupid kid took my money...<eos> What was I supposed...<eos> What was I supposed to do, sir?<eos> "Big Joe..."<eos> Give us Big Joe's full name and address.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know that.<eos> Let me ask again.<eos> You will give us Big Joe's address or I charge you with murder.
You just said, "i accuse you," And, "the soup is too hot"?
And ignoring me.<eos> No, i'm not getting involved.<eos> Cece Send the text.<eos> That was terrifying.<eos> Wow, that voice is giving me gooseflesh.<eos> Mm, okay, fine, i'll do it.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> You're welcome?<eos> It's so easy; she's like a puppet.<eos> I can hear you.
Okay.<eos> ...But then She ripped me in front of everyone, dude.<eos> Isn't ripping you what aly does?<eos> Yes, but we're a couple now, man.<eos> I'm flummoxed.<eos> What should i do?<eos> Should i say something?<eos> No.<eos> Don't communicate.<eos> It's not gonna get you anywhere.
Girl, you are some mess.<eos> Shit, I might just win tonight.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> It's gonna be quick, a'ight?<eos> Don't let Earn spook you and shit.<eos> - Spook me? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Man, I ain't scared of nothing.<eos> - You call your gun "Daddy"?<eos> That's weird, man.<eos> Is it weird when your girl call you "Daddy"?
Oh, shit, shit. Oh, shit.<eos> Did you check your jacket?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> I just think we need a chance as humans to... fail in order to discover what actually works, you know?<eos> People don't think there's a process to being happy.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I guess I just want a chance to find out.<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> I get the whole "follow your dreams" thing, but, um, our daughter needs all the tools to survive, and... that includes you, Earn.
Yeah. Hey, hey.<eos> Hey, D. Ah, here he blows.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So what you think? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, this a good dog. Uh-huh.<eos> All right.<eos> - Here you are.<eos> - Good deal.<eos> I'll catch you.<eos> Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Why don't we just talk about it and figure out what you want?<eos> No, that's what I always do.<eos> I talk and I talk.<eos> Not this time.<eos> I'm gonna, I'm gonna... Push through the panic And I'm gonna...<eos> Really?<eos> I'm gonna go get proposed to.<eos> Okay, look, well, if you start freaking out and you need anything, just holler, okay?<eos> I will not need anything from you!<eos> If you get chilly, here's a blanket that I knitted you.
Yeah, I don't know who let Nick's mute park friend cook dinner for 20, but I want to find and throw up on them.<eos> That's why you left.<eos> Why didn't you just tell me?<eos> Because I don't like being vulnerable.<eos> It was stupid of me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you, you maniac.<eos> You love... You love me?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
I got weird in there.<eos> I've gotten weirder in there than you have.<eos> Really?<eos> Those pillows.<eos> There's just, Like, extra, like...<eos> Pressure.<eos> If you don't mind, I'd like to say A few words about my mom and my mom's...<eos> - My mom's friend Susan. - My mom's friend Susan.<eos> God, you guys, let me talk.<eos> Look, Susan, I know I never fully accepted you.
That's motherhood, lady.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> Schmidt, you are getting off that plane in time for your wedding.<eos> Schmidt's on an airplane?<eos> Cece?<eos> Oh, my God. Are you sitting on your walkie?<eos> Cece.<eos> Schmidt's asleep?<eos> This is by far the most romantic thing that anyone has ever done for me.<eos> I love you so much.
Everybody say that with me once.<eos> Marriage is about s...<eos> I imagined that differently.<eos> You're okay.<eos> You're okay. Pull it together.<eos> Just let the index cards go.<eos> Speak from the heart.<eos> You know who I'm talking to when I say you were rude to me earlier at the bar.<eos> And now who's in control?<eos> I could point to you and call you out, but I won't.
Shut up.<eos> I think you know taking our chances down here to protect the "Raza" was the right call.<eos> In fact, I think if you'd been in the pilot seat, you would've done the exact same thing.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> You're just looking for an excuse to be mad at me.<eos> I don't need an excuse.<eos> I got a damn good reason as it is.<eos> All right, you want me to say it?<eos> ! I'll say it.<eos> I'm sorry I turned you in.
We can either stay down here and wait to die, or we can take our chances up there.<eos> This time, I'll let you make the call.<eos> Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> Hey. I brought someone to meet you.<eos> This is Five, another member of our crew.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hey. Come.<eos> So, how are you feeling?<eos> Much better now, thanks.<eos> It must have been terrible, what was happening to you on that ship.
Paris?<eos> The whimsical art of mime?<eos> I went to the Hypertext Conference a few weeks ago.<eos> - The what conference?<eos> - Hypertext.<eos> Some pretty big names were there...<eos> Apple, Xerox.<eos> - I'm surprised you didn't hear about it.<eos> - Yeah, me, too.<eos> It was right after I saw you in COMDEX.
Wait, um...<eos> I'm really sorry that I didn't trust you.<eos> I don't like who I've been this weekend.<eos> It's been a weird situation for me, too.<eos> The other night at the hotel, I was reading your emails on your laptop.<eos> I can't believe that I did that.<eos> I just couldn't get Joe out of my head, and it was completely irrational and I'm sorry.<eos> I just... don't want us to lie to one another.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
I don't understand.<eos> You know why I wanted us to meet here?<eos> I just didn't want to forget what had happened, how painful that was.<eos> Why?<eos> And then I almost did forget last night when we talked, when it felt good, when I was with my friend again.<eos> And then you reminded me how easily you toss people aside when you feel like they're in your way.<eos> This about Joe.<eos> No, this is about you.<eos> Jesus!<eos> I was trying to help you.

No, I'm into it, very into it, but, yeah, it's been a little confusing.<eos> Yeah, I think I was a little unsure, but I'm... but I'm not anymore.<eos> I just... I think I need to take things really slow, like super, super slow.<eos> I can roll with that.<eos> I just want to get to know you better.<eos> That's all.<eos> So are you comfortable with me telling you that I think you look incredibly beautiful right now?<eos> Um...<eos> Yeah, I think I can handle that.<eos> And... and, uh... would it be okay if I kissed you?

Uh, sure.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm gonna have to call you back.<eos> [Pounding On Door]<eos> - [Power Winds Down] - Ophelia?<eos> Mom.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Oh.<eos> I was picking out linens for the amfAR gala when I got a call from Shelby at Kappa National that you were pledging.<eos> I am thrilled to personally welcome you into the fold.
Harris James.<eos> I have a few questions about your break-in.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> Please?<eos> It's for a criminology paper I'm writing.<eos> Yeah, I said no.<eos> Your crime is such an anomaly.<eos> They didn't steal anything.<eos> There has to be some other reason they chose you.

I wish that I had more information for you.<eos> Well, can I take a picture of this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> [Somber Music]<eos> Hey...umm... look, I...<eos> I know there's something going on with you, and I don't understand it, but... I'm here when you want to talk.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.
Shut up!<eos> Listen, Sammy, your dad had a great day.<eos> Okay, I got irons in the fire, kid.<eos> This guy called me, he thinks he wants to do one of my stories.<eos> You remember the one about the junk man?<eos> He could see things other people couldn't. Could turn garbage into gold.<eos> He thinks it could go to television. I'm talkin' TV, the big game.<eos> You, me, the big game.<eos> Everything could change. Even for her.<eos> Don't tell her I woke you up. All right, go back to bed.
Sorry, Gary.<eos> I love you. That's okay, Sammy, take your time.<eos> I love you, baby.<eos> - Hey. You okay?<eos> - Hi.<eos> Come here.<eos> I want to...<eos> John. Okay, you know I'm a gamer.<eos> I come here, I throw down.<eos> Yeah. That's why I love you.
Oh, thank you!<eos> - What do you say?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> - She forgets everything.<eos> Thanks again.<eos> She was some yoga teacher, proper bendy. Look. Look.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Fuck!<eos> What, she sent that to you, did she?
- Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Hello, darling!<eos> Creative, your well-wishers.<eos> Don't eat it.<eos> It's a cake.<eos> That's its job.<eos> I'm going to have a bath.<eos> Grammy-award-winning rapper Tusk is still with us.<eos> Now, Tusk, there are loads of online videos of people trying to emulate you, but this is our favourite.

I'm actually here.<eos> - God. - And we have to go.<eos> - You have to listen to me.<eos> - How are you here?<eos> You know that photo that you sent me?<eos> I dug around and apparently Shou Saito took out a patent for a computer brain interface last year.<eos> How are you real? I don't...<eos> Okay, fuck. I don't...<eos> They brought you here!<eos> You are, you're real, and they brought you here, and they're trying to fuck with me.

This doesn't even count.<eos> Hi, Susie.<eos> Susie, I didn't mean it.<eos> I didn't mean hi.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Where is Duke?<eos> Duke is sleeping at Lam's house, and Max...<eos> I don't give a shit where Max is right now.<eos> Mom, you're freakazoid.<eos> Please stop freaking out so we don't have to send you to a mental hospital.
I mean, I know I don't have to tell you. It's like you know...<eos> You know her forever. You guys go, like, way back.<eos> We go way, way back.<eos> You know this.<eos> My dad and I got in a fight, and, uh, he kicked me out of the house, and I was so scared, and she took me in, and she got me a job.<eos> Yeah, she was 19, she was already taking care of people.<eos> She was amazing. She was full of confidence.<eos> She was so beautiful.<eos> I mean, I never knew anybody who had so much potential.<eos> And then she met you, Jeff.

- No, no, no. I know you're a working girl.<eos> Don't worry, it's fine.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> You look really good.<eos> - Oh, thank you. You too.<eos> - Mhm. - Yeah, I like your hair.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, it's cute.<eos> - Thanks. Looks better than the last time.<eos> Did you go to that shop I told you to go to?
I smoked last night.<eos> Smoked what? Weed.<eos> That thing you sell.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, girl, I don't sell shit.<eos> You better get off my phone, talkin' that mess. How do you pass a drug test?<eos> You smoke? Yes.<eos> Alfred, I am allowed to smoke.<eos> Well, weed is for people who aren't going anywhere, though.<eos> It's, like, for losers. Like, remember?<eos> Listen, I am calling you because I need your help.
The patient is HIV positive.<eos> Now, or he'll lose the eye.<eos> Help me.<eos> Clamp.<eos> Here.<eos> - Surgical scissors.<eos> - Here.<eos> Your vision will return in a little while.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Did Dr. Wheeler tell you to perform that procedure?
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.<eos> -And La Quica? -He's not here.<eos> He's back there, looking for you.<eos> If he finds out I'm here, he'll want to kill me too.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Because of you, I'll never be able to go back to Medellín.<eos> -Maritza! -Because of you,<eos> -my daughter and I have to live in hiding.<eos> -Relax, relax, relax!<eos> I really am sorry, and I'm here because I want to help you.
Okay, then. You two, in the front with me.<eos> Berna, with his men, around back.<eos> Just stay clear of the windows.<eos> - Let's go, then. - Let's move.<eos> - They're everywhere. - Let's go down.<eos> Where were you going, you filthy son of a bitch? Huh?<eos> Here it is, Mrs. Escobar.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - It's a delivery.<eos> - But who told you to buy this? - It was me.
Where's Velasco?<eos> There he is.<eos> Welcome.<eos> - Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela.<eos> - Lion.<eos> This is my brother, Miguel.<eos> And this gentleman is our associate, Pacho Herrera.<eos> I'm very pleased to meet you, gentlemen.<eos> Lion...<eos> May I call you that? - Yes, sir.
How are you, Tata?<eos> How are our children?<eos> My love, we're all okay.<eos> We need you.<eos> And I need you.<eos> Listen, I'm going to get you out of there soon.<eos> I talked to the attorney general. Everything is ready.<eos> Shh.<eos> Just hearing your voice, I feel calm.<eos> I love you very much.
Tata? Pablo, they killed her.<eos> They dumped her in front of the hotel.<eos> Who?<eos> Valeria.<eos> Are you all okay?<eos> Yes, we're okay.<eos> Listen. I need you to be strong.<eos> Everything will end soon. But you need to be stronger than ever, Tata.<eos> I'll call you back soon.<eos> I love you very much.
Sure, boss.<eos> Tata.<eos> Yes, my love?<eos> I just want you to know... that I love you very much.<eos> You and our children.<eos> You may not hear from me for a while.<eos> What's happening, Pablo?<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Something I have to do.<eos> But you know that I will never, never leave you, right?
I can't protect a rat.<eos> I didn't think you'd betray me.<eos> You were going to get yourself killed, Judy.<eos> So now, you're going to get on that plane.<eos> And if I don't, what? What happens?<eos> If you don't get on, then you'll leave with the Castaños.<eos> And I won't protect you anymore.<eos> Tell me something.<eos> Did Cali arrange this?<eos> How much did they offer you? At least tell me that.
We both know that won't happen.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop! Shh!<eos> - Listen to me, Pablo.<eos> - They're talking.<eos> -You will always be Pablo Escobar.<eos> -Boss.<eos> You will always be that man that's admired and followed.<eos> My man.<eos> My love, there's a lot of journalists who want to speak with you.<eos> The people love you and follow you.
All right, Pablo. But think about what I'm saying.<eos> It's very important.<eos> It's our only way out really.<eos> Alvaro, let's go slowly.<eos> Colonel! Colonel, this is Lieutenant Martinez.<eos> Think about turning yourself in, my love.<eos> Think of your family.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> All right?<eos> I love you very much.
Thank you, Gustavo.<eos> Did you know that Julius Caesar invaded Britain when he was 44?<eos> He lost power many times, but always got it back.<eos> Never letting anything stop him.<eos> Yeah, but that motherfucker had a fucking army.<eos> You remember when we used to talk about going to the jungle if shit got too heavy?<eos> -Yeah, and joining the guerrillas. -Mmm.<eos> Tata wants me to surrender.<eos> Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.<eos> She loves you very much.
Apparently, they've encountered some resistance and suffered losses.<eos> What about our crew?<eos> They eluded escape and are still at large.<eos> We still have the transfer pods we used to break into Reynaud's facility.<eos> Could you use one of them to get me down on that station?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - All right.<eos> Then let's do it.<eos> I'm sorry, Six.<eos> I'm afraid I can't help you.
Could you use one of them to get me down on that station?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - All right.<eos> Then let's do it.<eos> I'm sorry, Six.<eos> I'm afraid I can't help you.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> What, you don't trust me, either?<eos> My trust in you is irrelevant.<eos> I'm under strict orders not to allow you off this ship.
Get on the bus. Take it home.<eos> Mom, don't be a drama queen.<eos> That bus doesn't even go to our house.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> You're going to take the bus to Ventura, get out, walk up the hill.<eos> Bye! Bye!<eos> Get out!<eos> I mean it! Mom, we're sorry.<eos> We don't need anything.<eos> We'll help you with the groceries when we get home.
Everybody, stop!<eos> I am so, so, so sorry.<eos> My God, this is so embarrassing. Shut up, Max!<eos> Mommy's doing her best!<eos> Mom, call Dad.<eos> The firemen are going to want to talk to Dad.<eos> I can talk to the firemen!<eos> I don't need your fucking father!<eos> I can talk to a fireman by myself!<eos> I mean, I can send you out for any audition that you want, but you have to be careful about burning yourself out.
And honey, you can be anything you want to be.<eos> Seriously. But also, if you just get a job and get by, you're still gonna love your life.<eos> Because life is good.<eos> Even at its worst.<eos> You came here just to say that to me?<eos> Was it shitty?<eos> I thought it was gonna be good.<eos> It wasn't shitty, you liked it. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - I love you. - I love you, too.<eos> - I love you, too.
95% of the time, they're benign.<eos> I'm gonna put you together with a brain surgeon."<eos> Actually, he just texted me earlier... the brain surgeon.<eos> - What? Why?<eos> - I don't know. I guess we're sort of friends now.<eos> He wants me to set him up with someone.<eos> It does seem fast to be back on your feet after brain surgery.<eos> Yeah, that's what I think.<eos> Wait.<eos> Your brain surgeon just texted you to hook him up?
That's great for me. Thank you so much.<eos> Hi, Stoopie-foo! Did you have so much fun?<eos> Mom? - What?<eos> Do you hate it?<eos> I can tell.<eos> You wanna quit?<eos> Okay, good, 'cause it's right in the middle of traffic anyway.<eos> And you shouldn't come if you're not into it.<eos> Also, I'm really excited you're quitting chorus.<eos> Also, hi, I love you.
Oh, Sunday we have a...<eos> We don't have anything, Mom. Don't lie.<eos> That sounds great.<eos> Just text my mom the data points, and we'll see you on Sunday.<eos> Great!<eos> See you all then.<eos> - Fun. - Okay.<eos> - Well, good night.<eos> Kill you.<eos> I love you too, Mom.
No, Trinity, I don't think that my teenaged daughter is okay, okay?<eos> None of that is okay.<eos> But wait until Morgan gets to be her age.<eos> The problem with you church people is that you like to pretend that shit isn't the way it is.<eos> And, like, that's gonna fix it?<eos> That's a teenager, and, yeah, she's a mess.<eos> And I'm failing completely.<eos> And I don't need God or Jesus or you to tell me that.<eos> And by the way, you wanna judge me?<eos> How about you dumping your daughter on me on Friday without any warning, and then when I call you, you don't say sorry or even acknowledge the bullshit passive-aggressive power play you pulled on me, okay?
It was?<eos> What happened?<eos> What happened Friday, Trinity?<eos> I was...<eos> I was at a meeting with Mark and the church leader.<eos> Our marriage is not good.<eos> Sure.<eos> Shit.<eos> Shit?<eos> I envy you.
You made a new friend even.<eos> So, like, maybe we should be more open about who, uh, we have playdates with.<eos> Like, you know, what about that girl Nellie?<eos> What?<eos> I think it would be nice to have Nellie over.<eos> - Who's Nellie?<eos> - The girl from chorus, honey.<eos> Which girl?<eos> The black one, baby.<eos> The one who asked you for a playdate on Friday.
Mom! Mom!<eos> - You know what? - Mom! Come down here.<eos> It's quieter. - Mom! Mom, no!<eos> - It's all right. I'm not going to murder you.<eos> Mom! - Uh...<eos> - Yeah. Go on in there. It's just the laundry room.<eos> Oh.<eos> Great.<eos> There you go.<eos> Okay, Harvey, you have to understand that I'm Mom, Dad, and the cops around here, and you seem like a nice kid, but the first time I ever met you, you lied right to my face.
No, it hurts, Mom!<eos> And I really like him.<eos> And... And everybody knows.<eos> And he's making fun of me with everybody!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Honey, I'm really sorry.<eos> Do you want to go trick or treating with me and your sisters?<eos> That's stupid.<eos> Baby, I get it.<eos> I get it. That would have picked you up a few years ago, but I just...
Say hi for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Welcome to the DEO, Mr. Schott.<eos> Thank you, Hank, or Director Henshaw.<eos> Or was it J'onn, or Martian Manhunter?<eos> - What's the protocol here?<eos> - "Sir" will do just fine.<eos> Yes, sir, Hank. J'onn, no...<eos> Congratulations, Winn.<eos> It's good to have you officially on the team.
What do I do.. my heart grieves for you.<eos> As if, every breath of mine chants your name.<eos> As if, every breath of mine chants your name.<eos> Taran, it was a pleasure meeting you.<eos> Be ready, and I'll see you at 10.<eos> Sure.<eos> Manpreet, can I give you a hug please.<eos> Of course.<eos> - Keep coming as long as you're here.<eos> Good morning. I've been calling you for so long.
Blessed love...!<eos> Blessed love...!<eos> Why does it feel like..<eos> ...your gaze lingers in my eyes!<eos> Expressing things that I never knew of.<eos> You are everywhere I see..<eos> ...then how can I go away from you?<eos> Congratulations, dear heart, this is love!<eos> Congratulations, dear heart, this is love!<eos> I still stand where I met you first.
Yeah. Actually, we went out for breakfast.<eos> Pete's.<eos> We go there every Saturday for breakfast.<eos> It's about an hour and a half from here.<eos> They sell the best pancakes in the world.<eos> Amar really wanted to go there..so we left as early as 7am.<eos> You know Jasleen..<eos> The girl beating the drums at the airport.<eos> Oh yes, right. She is throwing a party today.<eos> She has invited you as well as Francoise and Daniel.
Otherwise how will you spread happiness?<eos> Even if it means making someone sad.<eos> Do what is right.<eos> Do what you feel is right!<eos> There's nothing more you can do.<eos> Right?<eos> You said 'meet me for breakfast at 9'.<eos> I was there at 9.<eos> But you didn't show up.<eos> I looked around, asked people if anyone had seen you.

Nor the next day.<eos> The people who were helping us look for you.. It was clearly evident from their faces, that we've lost you.<eos> Amar.. ...I never even dreamt about a life without you.<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> Then I mustered a lot of courage and stood up again. Thinking that I had to continue without you.<eos> But then suddenly, I bumped into this fool.<eos> Shekhar.<eos> As soon as I took my eyes off you.. ...life swept me off my feet.<eos> Today, I want to confess to you in His presence, Amar.<eos> No matter how much I love you.. But now there's someone else in my life.
Only I have that right. me.. not you.<eos> If I had that right. ...then you could've never loved someone else.<eos> Not now..or in the next lifetime..or after that.<eos> Then why?<eos> I just want to tell you.. What you're doing is completely different from what you want, Taran.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong, Taran.<eos> The other day, in the temple, when I asked you why you chose me..<eos> ...you said 'I am doing the right thing'.<eos> It's true that it's not my fault.<eos> Also true that I love you.
Their deaths saved the lives of millions, and I doubt you shed a tear for the Seers.<eos> You're as much responsible for what happened to Milo as they were.<eos> They would have forced him to help them achieve their goals, and he didn't want to be a part of that.<eos> You can try to justify it all you want, but I'll never forgive you.<eos> That would be the easy way out, to hide behind anger and bitterness so that you never have to face the truth, but you're stronger than that, and that's the type of strength I need by my side.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> My feelings for you haven't changed, Nyx.<eos> You're insane.<eos> What type of future is there for you on that ship?<eos> The others will never fully accept you.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> ¿Quieres que te lo cuente otra vez?<eos> Gabriel, Gabriel, come back to me.<eos> Come back to me.<eos> Come back.<eos> Tienes que luchar.<eos> - God has not abandoned you. - Marcus.
And thanks for talking to Kat.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who...<eos> Marky-boy.<eos> Where are you, lad?<eos> I command you, unclean spirit, along with all your minions now attacking this servant of God, by the mysteries of the incarnation, the passion, the resurrection and the ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, by the coming of our Lord for judgment,
Cover up, it's chilly.<eos> You washed me when I was little, now you get shocked?<eos> Now you're all hairy, you're disgusting!<eos> Go set the table, move.<eos> Smoking again, huh?<eos> Just one.<eos> You're smoking again.<eos> Yeah, and so?<eos> You're edgy?<eos> I saw who brought you home tonight.
- Thank you.<eos> Did I Hertz your feelings?<eos> I hate you.<eos> It was funny.<eos> I just need for you to just gauge to see if he's giving me friend vibes or fuck vibes.<eos> You can't tell? No.<eos> Sometimes Jared is hella dodgy.<eos> One day I think he's feeling me, and the next, I can't read him.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Guess I'll sort this out for you just like I did for your gynecologist, which was friend vibes, by the way.
- I had a great time with you.<eos> - I did, too.<eos> But please keep all of your friends away from Kelli. - She's crazy.<eos> - Nah, she was funny.<eos> - And she kind of had a good point.<eos> - About what?<eos> That maybe sometimes guys aren't straightforward enough.<eos> I like straightforward.<eos> I like you.<eos> I like you, too.
- I think we should get it.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> You don't need the pump, Frank. Lotion already comes in a pump.<eos> You're gonna transfer all that lotion from the pump it already comes in to this new pump for no reason?<eos> I hate you.<eos> - Is that what I sound like?<eos> - I'm just trying to tell you. - Put the pump down!<eos> Put it down!<eos> - They'll hear you.
But maybe the "Hindenburg" was meant to explode,<eos> Kate was meant to die.<eos> Maybe we don't get to make it up as we go.<eos> - Maybe some things are just...<eos> - What?<eos> Fate?<eos> How was it?<eos> What was it like?<eos> Uh, you know, to time-travel?<eos> I'll take you to dinner, tell you all about it.
Some things I've never told you.
Tomorrow night... tomorrow night where?<eos> - United Shipyard.<eos> - In Queens?<eos> There was a chase.<eos> You were shot first outside of berth 34.<eos> The kill shot at 9:12 was on the access road.<eos> This doesn't make any sense, I mean, how can you possibly even know...<eos> Forensics, Frank.<eos> There was a crime scene, shell casings, a body.<eos> They pulled you out of the East River, you and another guy.
I was thinking about running down some of the guys<eos> - from his old operation.<eos> - Why?<eos> This was your idea.<eos> Just looking for a little closure of my own.<eos> And you want from me...<eos> You want names.<eos> First thing's first.<eos> Frank, this is Chester, he's your hookup.<eos> This is Rainman, he'll have eyes on you in the apartment.
I'm a cop?<eos> If I'm a cop, what does that make you, huh?<eos> - Are you really that dumb?<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Okay, okay, look, if I was a cop, if I was, you think it's gonna end like this with you just shooting me right here?<eos> You don't think that Little Jay's gonna come at you?<eos> Huh? You don't think other cops are gonna come at you, Ricky?<eos> Other cops?<eos> Like the ones working for Little Jay?<eos> Or the ones that sold you out?
before I'd start my day.<eos> This is my spot.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's an epic spot, Grandpa.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> It is, Grandpa.<eos> - If something happens to me...<eos> - Dad...<eos> If something happens, this is where I'd like to be remembered.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Evan.
I get it. Look, you don't.<eos> You don't get it. Look...<eos> I don't want you five, ten years down the line regretting that you didn't get a college education.<eos> - Well, if you know my perspective, then why aren't you listening?<eos> Because I wanna make my own decisions, okay?<eos> Look, I want to be my own man!<eos> - But, you're making a mistake.<eos> - Well, then I'll learn from it!<eos> You don't have to learn from it, that's the point.<eos> I'm here to spare you from this.
Should've warned you this is just casual.<eos> What?<eos> I'm casual.<eos> I'm casual.<eos> You look hot.<eos> No.<eos> I look hot?<eos> Your butt looks like an apple.<eos> Hey, Pierce, when did you get here?<eos> Okay. I'm tagging you in.
You promise?<eos> Kinda.<eos> Yes.<eos> Good, thank you.<eos> Yeah, she just won't go back to sleep.<eos> Well, let...<eos> let me try.<eos> Can she... Can she hear me?<eos> - Is the sound okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, she can hear you.
- Sweetie, you there?<eos> Daniel?<eos> I-I-I'm here!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm all right.<eos> - I'm okay, I think.<eos> Polly, I-I wish I could see you.<eos> I love you so much.
Daniel?<eos> I-I-I'm here!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm all right.<eos> - I'm okay, I think.<eos> Polly, I-I wish I could see you.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you, too.
I mean, there's something wrong with her, but she's not an alcoholic.<eos> Dehydration, bruises easy, joint hyper mobility... that's for sure.<eos> Fainting spe...<eos> Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?<eos> You're not as strong as you think.<eos> I only encountered a couple cases in my career.<eos> I mean, we'll have to run tests to confirm it.<eos> But if you're right and she has this... Karev, you may have just saved this girl's life.<eos> Did you tell her?<eos> No, that's why I paged you.
But, Jules, I bet if you asked the boss personally, he'd let it slide this once.<eos> Of course.<eos> No, Mom.<eos> I know, but I can't sit here anymore.<eos> I keep playing it back in my head.<eos> It's like I'm watching it like it didn't happen to me.<eos> I didn't even want to go to that party.<eos> I feel so helpless, Mom.<eos> I'll call you back a little later.<eos> I love you too.
We just have to be so careful today.<eos> Well, the garage is spotless.<eos> I have the wrench in my trunk.<eos> Once we bury him, we're kind of home free.<eos> What's next?<eos> How do you pick your targets?<eos> There was this girl in the station, and she...<eos> I'm sorry. "Home free?"<eos> There's a dead human being in the trunk of your car.<eos> Is none of this landing on you?
Hey, what happened to making things right?<eos> To helping people?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm just... I'm not the person that you think I am, okay?<eos> I can't... I can't save you or anyone else.<eos> I just want to go back to my old life.<eos> This whole thing was a huge mistake.<eos> Do your friends even know what happened to you?<eos> It's time for you to leave.<eos> I see you for who you really are, and if that scares you, fine, but I'm a real friend and...
- Mm-hmm. - And I'm hearing "freeze"...<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna write about race issues on campus.<eos> It's crazy that in a school as prestigious as this, racism is still so prevalent.<eos> You got to make it right.<eos> Blows my mind.<eos> Just got to make it right.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> I'm not here to cause any trouble, but, um...<eos> I found something that I think you need to see.<eos> And if after you see this you can just walk away, then I will never bother you again.
- What's going on?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just having a bad night and this just...<eos> I don't like showing my stuff, Jules.<eos> It gives me major anxiety.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Let's just go somewhere quiet and we can talk.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're not fine.<eos> Let me help you.
Of course, yeah.<eos> It should be pretty nice, though. It's gonna be at Hatchet Hall.<eos> I'll try my best.<eos> All right.<eos> I should probably let Diane know if I'm bringing a plus one.<eos> Okay, put me on the list.<eos> - See you tonight.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Where are you gonna go?<eos> Everybody's laughing at you, a female Bozo.
That's why Guillaume never went to jail.<eos> You mean...<eos> De Groves and Vauban know each other.<eos> De Groves knew everything about Vauban's competitors, wiretapping sessions, planned police raids...<eos> He would warn Vauban, who would sidestep the attack or perfect his defense.<eos> What did De Groves have to gain in doing all that?<eos> He was named Prosecutor General at the Poitiers Court of Appeals thanks to a lobby campaign orchestrated by Charente FM.<eos> You know so many things.<eos> I'm impressed, you know?<eos> I want to kiss you really bad right now.
Wait for me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Go.<eos> Do you want me to speak like a poet or like Guillaume?<eos> How does Guillaume speak?<eos> He's raw, vulgar, rude, obscene. But he's real.<eos> I prefer the poet.<eos> It won't change anything anyway.<eos> Catoun, you drive me crazy.<eos> I want to lie down and make love to you.
I'm Amanda.<eos> - No, don't.<eos> Don't say hello?<eos> Hello, Amanda!<eos> Are you friends?<eos> We're very good friends.<eos> You're a terrible assis-friend.<eos> ...Seattle police have ruled the death of billionaire entrepreneur Patrick Spring and several others an animal attack rather than a murder as was initially reported, though the nature of the animal remains undisclosed at this time.<eos> Sources within the police department will neither confirm nor deny-- Mm-hmm! --whether the tragic incident bears any connection to the recent disappearance of Spring's daughter, heiress Lydia Spring, now missing for over four days--<eos> Do you have any friends who can come by and help you with this, cleaning up, or-

- Stand down.<eos> - You can't just come in...<eos> - They stole the soul exchanger!<eos> And you know who has it?<eos> Your man, Estevez.<eos> So... it's finally over.<eos> You got no friends left, Rimmer.<eos> I've been making calls to brothers in high places all day.<eos> Nobody's picking up.<eos> There's no one left to help you.
- Yeah.<eos> Saved everyone.<eos> There were like a hundred dudes out there. And we beat them up, and then they ran away.<eos> Dude, it was sick.<eos> Where's Dirk?<eos> The cop took him to the hospital.<eos> It was not pretty.<eos> Farah took Lydia somewhere.<eos> She said to meet her at this address at 6:00.<eos> Dirk says you hate him now, 'cause he tricked you or something?
What is it?<eos> Ethiopian.<eos> That's not a word.<eos> Is that a word?<eos> You did a thing back there with the thing.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> And you did, too.<eos> Hey, that guy, um, Dirk Gently... you weren't supposed to kill him. You were supposed to protect him.<eos> That's not the first time that's happened, is it?<eos> I was supposed to bring you there, too, so...
I'm Amanda.<eos> Cool jacket.<eos> It's all happening.<eos> Oh, for godsakes...<eos> Oh! Will you stop following me?<eos> I was just going down to get the magic lightbulb from my car.<eos> Magic lightbulb!<eos> Look, what did I tell you--<eos> Just, Dirk, will you just get out of my apartment.<eos> I told you it would bend back around to you, and now it has!
Your apartment. It did not used to look like this.<eos> Yeah, there was a whole... thing.<eos> I swear to God, you are the shadiest person in the world.<eos> Todd!<eos> Todd, come out!<eos> Farah says she's solved the mystery!<eos> Todd, come out!<eos> Farah says she didn't solve the mystery!<eos> Oh, God...<eos> Are they waiting for you?
Farah!<eos> We should definitely go down this passageway.<eos> Dirk, wait!<eos> Dirk, we should just stay here!<eos> Gordon.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's this?<eos> A present.<eos> Aw, Gordon. I told you.
Rapunzel, get over here!<eos> I'm sorry I did this to you.
- Hey!<eos> Both of you, out of here, now!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm sorry, I screwed up your night, your one night out.<eos> No, it's okay, that guy was an asshole.<eos> I know you never go out anymore because of the disease, and now I'm... I'm covered in beer, and I'm crying like a pussy, and...<eos> It's great.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
- Gwen Stebarfie.<eos> - That was a good one.<eos> Is that Timothy?<eos> I thought you two broke up.<eos> Oh, I love him.<eos> But he is so quiet.<eos> I wish he came with subtitles.<eos> Hey there, Timothy.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> What brings you here?
- I'm gonna stand up now. - Okay.<eos> I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna head off.<eos> Let me get back to you?<eos> He's not offering you his extra ticket<eos> - to a Mariners game.<eos> - Well, he caught me off guard, and I'm not saying no, I just need more time.<eos> Well, what for?<eos> He's kind, he's handsome, he's brilliant.<eos> And he loves you just the way you are.
He sounds like a Nigerian Ruben Studdard.<eos> What... Hey, why are you crying?<eos> - Because of what you did.<eos> - Babe, it was nothing.<eos> No, you took care of it, and you're always taking care of me.<eos> You're like my black Spider-Man.<eos> Hey. Hey, come here. Come here.<eos> - Now I got snot all on you.<eos> - Hey, it's okay.<eos> I just love you so much.
What?<eos> Can we go?<eos> - What? Why?<eos> - I just don't feel good.<eos> I think I had too much junk at the movies.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're lying.<eos> I cannot see you as a fat kid.
What?<eos> We 'bout to be charging up a tab at stupid places!<eos> Okay, sushi every night, and not California rolls.<eos> I'm talking monkfish.<eos> No, I am so pumped for you.<eos> - You earned that shit.<eos> - Thanks, babe.<eos> And Meridian is a good company, too.<eos> I mean, they do a few things backwards, but...<eos> Well, that's why they got you, though, to fix their shit!
- I am.<eos> - The kids could not stop talking about you.<eos> Well, I hope nothing I said went over their heads.<eos> I only heard the best things.<eos> May I get you a drink, Molly? Or do you object?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> I'm not drinking tonight.<eos> Okay, sounds great.<eos> - I'll catch up with you two later.<eos> - Okay. - Good to see you, Justin.
- Yes, Chef.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> There's two sides of Dominique.<eos> The professional, serious, talented, capable side.<eos> And then the whimsical... sort of sensual, free-spirited side.<eos> My name was Dominique when I was born.<eos> Do you know that song?<eos> I often wonder what was my life from zero to 18 months.<eos> And I ask my mom and she say,<eos> "You know, we don't really know much about your life during that time, but when we adopted you, they called you 'the Smiley Face.'
Once she stood up and asked them to be quiet, and they insulted her.<eos> That's all.<eos> Did you tell the school?<eos> We kept asking for her to be moved to another class.<eos> If they'd done that...<eos> I tried to defend her.<eos> I should have done more.<eos> Sometimes I kept quiet because I was scared.<eos> Scared of who?<eos> I'm here to help you.
We're making progress, Marion.<eos> We have new information.<eos> We're taking the case to a court in Paris.<eos> France 3 asked to interview us.<eos> Le Figaro did too.<eos> That's not our style. You know us.<eos> But we did it.<eos> We talked about you.<eos> How they made you suffer.<eos> My love, we won't let them get away with it, those who hurt you.
I guess there's nothing left for me to do than to wish you all best of luck and bid you a fond adieu.<eos> - You're not going anywhere.<eos> - I'm...<eos> I'm not? - You're coming with us.<eos> - I am?<eos> I-I-I can't.<eos> I mean, I gotta get back to work.<eos> I mean, I got... I got people depending on me.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> What's to stop you from informing Reynaud and collecting some kind of snitch reward for your troubles?
It's late.<eos> I suggest we speak about it face to face.<eos> I'll come and see you in Chambéry any time.<eos> I'll call you back to give you my answer.<eos> It will be on my conditions.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> Show me.<eos> "Paul Touvier<eos> "Care of Intelligence.<eos> "The Resistance continues and has sentenced you to death.
ATV landed right on top of her. Okay.<eos> Trauma 1. And you've got more coming in.<eos> What happened?<eos> Knucklehead was trying to save his furry friends when the fire broke out.<eos> Trap bit him.<eos> Maybe a little bit of situational awareness might save you some pain next time, you damn hippie.<eos> Okay. Incoming. Trauma 2.<eos> My name is Derrick, and it's nothing like the pain those animals feel, you fascist!<eos> Hey, Mac!<eos> Last time I saw you, you were laying down fire in Afghanistan.
He can't do that.<eos> He gave up his parental rights.<eos> Yeah. Not technically, okay?<eos> He claims that the birth mother never told him about Brianna, that he just found out about her six months ago, and he has been looking for her ever since.<eos> She's 14 years old.<eos> I mean, he can't...<eos> He can't stake a claim on her after all these years, can he?<eos> He can't...<eos> It's up to the court, Drew.<eos> But he can keep you from getting her now.
Is there a problem, Count?<eos> What did they do to deserve this?<eos> They've shown me nothing but kindness.<eos> Don't tell me you're starting to grow a conscience.<eos> Call it professional curiosity.<eos> Well, what they did doesn't matter.<eos> Only one thing should be on your mind right now... how badly you want your revenge.<eos> I thought so.<eos> Well, this is very disappointing.<eos> I mean, I didn't spend years training you so you could spend your days fencing and get someone else to do your dirty work.
Whatever you have planned for this town, leave Belle and my unborn son out of it.<eos> Do you want the coin or not?<eos> Fine.<eos> I won't hurt them.<eos> But... are you sure that's all you want in return?<eos> What else did you have in mind?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> The tales in the Land of Untold Stories aren't the only ones that never played out.<eos> And what makes you think I have any interest in seeing how this one goes?<eos> Eventually, you'll get tired of waiting for that bookworm to accept you for who you are.
The handmaiden's story finally caught up with her.<eos> Just like yours is catching up with you.<eos> Miss me?<eos> Mommy's back.<eos> I killed you.<eos> Did you really think it would be that easy?<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Get behind me, honey.<eos> After everything I did for you, after everything we accomplished together, you threw me away like I never existed.<eos> No, I threw you away because you existed.
- I'm a slut.<eos> - I'm a slut.<eos> Go to Balcarce and Humberto Primo.<eos> NOW?<eos> I'M HERE<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hi babe, where are you?<eos> - I'm still at the audition.<eos> - Still?<eos> I can't talk right now, I'll call you later.
It has been a life long passion for me to show strong women.<eos> Hi, Spiegler.<eos> I rollbesätter for Rocco Siffredi tomorrow.<eos> you meet him, he should role occupy its next, or rather the last, movie.<eos> If you are lucky are you with it.<eos> you need to capture the ball!<eos> He can not even throw a football.<eos> Hello, How are you feeling, Gabriele?<eos> Fun to see you.<eos> - he covers you okay?
He was like then? Better?<eos> Worse? he was better then.<eos> Kelly. I have always wondered. Since this will be my last film,<eos> - where have you received this sexuality from?<eos> - I was born with it.<eos> - Okay. But sometimes have special people experienced anything... 0 your mother, your father, violence, rape...<eos> - you are talking about abuse.<eos> - No, if everything.<eos> that need not be sexually.<eos> I have never asked you before.
You stand for change, and I want change.<eos> No one wants change more than I do!<eos> Christ, I've changed parties 1 2 times!<eos> You really want to join the PEN?<eos> Come on, Bougon!<eos> You owe me one.<eos> It's time you returned the favour.<eos> Why do I owe you one?<eos> Who got you into politics?<eos> Who pissed you off enough to give you that push?
Do we want Quebec to fall into ruin?<eos> Of course not.<eos> He wants more justice in our society.<eos> But civil war?<eos> Do you think war is just?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Your brother isn't a leader. He's a yes-man.<eos> He says yes to everything.<eos> He says yes to extremists. He says yes to more justice. He says yes to more freedom.<eos> Not you, though. I asked you if you were in favour of war and ruin.
What kind of problem?<eos> The kind you don't want to be anywhere near.<eos> Chen's using an I.E.D. to send the virus airborne.<eos> It'll kill millions.<eos> Well, can you stop it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should probably get out of here, though.<eos> Ah, you know I'm not gonna do that.<eos> If you go kaboom, I go kaboom.<eos> This is what the Army trained you for.
We're in terrible danger.<eos> No, I'm telling you, I'm seeing it right now.<eos> There's someone attacking her!<eos> - SHE GROANS<eos> - Wait...<eos> What?<eos> Tanya, what's your address?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Something with a 3 in it.<eos> I think you know what waits for you here.
A prince is... responsible for his people.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You...<eos> The Cabinet of Souls IS empty?<eos> I wish it wasn't as much as you.<eos> Shame.<eos> We could have killed them.<eos> We could have killed them all.<eos> Committing one genocide for another.<eos> Were you ever going to let that stop you?
You both now share April's heart.<eos> You leave... or I'll make you leave.<eos> You have not seen the last of us.<eos> You will help these amazing humans here and these amazing humans will help you.<eos> So are we all, like, mates, then?<eos> It's Ram.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Hey, it's Tanya.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I haven't seen you since prom.
I guess talking about it didn't do me any good.<eos> - Well, not at first, anyway.<eos> - You?<eos> My dad died almost two years ago.<eos> He was fine at dinner.<eos> Just never woke up the next morning.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> The point is, I didn't know what anyone wanted me to say, so I didn't say anything.<eos> Until one day, I did.<eos> ! Whoever you are, I am going to string you up on that wall by your b...
Just never woke up the next morning.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> The point is, I didn't know what anyone wanted me to say, so I didn't say anything.<eos> Until one day, I did.<eos> ! Whoever you are, I am going to string you up on that wall by your b...<eos> I don't even understand some of these swearwords.<eos> He was purposefully provoking me.<eos> You know I'm not supposed to get this report.<eos> And amazingly, he hasn't asked for your immediate dismissal.<eos> He wants to observe you again.
You made me better.<eos> You were the right kind of scary.<eos> But now...<eos> - You're not afraid?<eos> - No.<eos> I AM afraid.<eos> I just...<eos> I just realised that.<eos> But I'm going to kick your arse anyway.<eos> I have to get it to attack you!
You don't remember walking around the city with just a towel on?<eos> I don't remember anything! Think.<eos> I was at the gym...<eos> I was in the locker room and there was a woman in the shower.<eos> There was a woman in the women's locker room?<eos> Shocking!<eos> I'm sorry I ruined your rehearsal.<eos> You're the most real thing I saw tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're getting you to a doctor tomorrow.
This is what your country thought you were worth.<eos> America needs to be saved from itself.<eos> - How?<eos> An attack?<eos> - More than that.<eos> It'll be a complete reset.<eos> We're gonna comp...<eos> That's enough.<eos> It's better if you don't know.<eos> They might interrogate you.
Time to wake up, Mr. Corben.<eos> Feel strange.<eos> I can only imagine.<eos> I'm calling security.<eos> We don't need the men with guns down here.<eos> Do we, John?<eos> How did I do that?<eos> Let me give you a little context.<eos> The Kryptonians tried to kill you.<eos> We salvaged you, modified you and resurrected you.
Is that true, John?<eos> Are you not ready to become the man who saved the world from an alien menace?<eos> What did you do to me?<eos> I've given you a gift.<eos> I've given you life with the very thing that will bring your enemies death.<eos> I've given you a second chance.<eos> I've given you a cause.<eos> Let's move.<eos> Supergirl.<eos> We haven't heard from you.
But it's cost me a lot.<eos> It cost me my father.<eos> - Alex, we're going to find him.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, how are we going to do that with you in Metropolis?<eos> Don't do that.<eos> This is not about one family over the other.<eos> This is about me not feeling alone anymore.<eos> When I'm with Clark, I feel like I'm connected to somebody who actually understands what it's like to be me.<eos> So does he understand that he abandoned you with us?
And by that I mean they're in no way ready.<eos> Kara, we're gonna have to go without them.<eos> We might not get this chance again.<eos> Meet me there.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> It's over, Metallo.<eos> I am happy to give myself up for my cause.<eos> But it's not over.<eos> Not by any means.<eos> You make a move, we'll incinerate you.
I need to talk to her.<eos> I haven't been very fair to her lately.<eos> Well, she is not here.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where is Alex?<eos> Freeze.<eos> It's not what it looks like, Danvers.<eos> Shut up and turn around.<eos> Here's what's going to happen.<eos> I'm bringing you in.
Let's really hang out.<eos> I will do everything I can to find Jeremiah, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Khao-shuh.<eos> What... What's that mean?<eos> There's not really a word for it in your language.<eos> I guess the closest thing would be...<eos> "To be continued"?<eos> I love you, Kara.<eos> I love you too, Kal.
Blimey.<eos> [Magee] Where's the Captain?<eos> Everybody! Where's the Captain!<eos> That's right!<eos> We've got the Captain and we're taking this ship!<eos> Sage!<eos> Do you mean him?<eos> Sage!<eos> What happened?<eos> How could that crocodile with the tiny baby arms tie you up?
Oh, thank you very much, King Julien.<eos> Oh, not at all.<eos> I do need to get home, but maybe a little pirate captaining can't hurt.<eos> [laughs] Right, my kidneys?<eos> Oh! Huntsman's horn, how did I get myself into this?<eos> I think he went this way.<eos> Come on. He can't hide forever.<eos> Psst! Huh? Hiya, hon.<eos> Made you some sandwiches before you get sacrificed and all.<eos> I told you not to put yourself on that silly list.
-[Mort screams] -You make me tingly all over, for reals.<eos> Especially you.<eos> Hmm? When I was up there on that stage today, I realized you've always been there for me, even when my parents weren't.<eos> What's everybody looking at?<eos> Are your eyes getting a bit moist, Maurice?<eos> Oh, you getting a little lump in your throat, buddy?<eos> No. Why?<eos> Whoa, hey. [chuckles] If you're trying to imply that I'm overly emotional or that I cry at the drop of a hat, then... [giggling] Guys, guys, check it.<eos> Say, Mo-Mo?<eos> Did I tell you that I had a near death experience when the Mega Gecko exploded?
Don't you like the lemur ladies?<eos> Uh, I don't really like being wet.<eos> Oh, come on, it's a Jacuzzi, man.<eos> They're fierce.<eos> Move!<eos> -I'm out of here.<eos> -[laughing] I think I swallowed my tongue. [chokes]<eos> Oh, you've got another one.<eos> Did you see the way those ladies reacted to the way you got your freak on?<eos> They love you, man.
The End.<eos> Thanks, Sky Gods!<eos> -[machine whirring] -[gasps] [whimpering] Who's there?<eos> If this is the ghost of Aunt Trudy, I'm sorry, but how was I supposed to know that you couldn't swim?<eos> Or climb out of a well?<eos> [panicking] ...and then they held me down and then they did stuff to me, and some of it tickled, [giggles] and then I woke up in my bed.<eos> Really, Mort?<eos> Aliens?<eos> Okay, little fella, out!<eos> What Clover's saying is, why would they abduct you when there's a perfectly good king to abduct?
What's going on?<eos> Guys? Don't worry, everybody!<eos> We'll just make more bars!<eos> Alright, you geckos!<eos> You got this!<eos> Looking great, Marty!<eos> I mean, really--<eos> Kathy, your eyes, fabulous!<eos> Jonathan, you've got a great... personality!<eos> Yeah! Nothing can stop you!
And Karl?<eos> You came too.<eos> Does this mean we're... friends now?<eos> We're not friends.<eos> We are eternal enemies.<eos> And no one will have the pleasure of destroying you except me.<eos> And trust me, I will destroy you.<eos> When you least expect it.<eos> Well, okay then.<eos> I'm sorry I never told you about the whole "being hired to be your friend" thing.
I'm not doing it.<eos> What?<eos> Why not?<eos> You just said yourself, it's sad.<eos> Yeah, but it's not pathetic.<eos> That's where I draw the line.<eos> Come on!<eos> We'll have fun.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You'll have nerds fawning all over you.
I'm always the last one anybody thinks of.<eos> Well, no, that's not true.<eos> I mean, sometimes it's Koothrappali.<eos> But we're not supposed to say that 'cause he's a minority.<eos> Bye.<eos> Stuart, wait.<eos> I do know what it feels like to be left out.<eos> I know how it feels, too.<eos> All right, this is about me and him; you're not part of it.<eos> Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable.
She cares what happens to you.<eos> The least you can do is return the favor.<eos> I know her...<eos> She hangs out down by the foundry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I've seen you around.<eos> Yeah, you're the little alien groupie.<eos> Right?<eos> Always sticking your nose in our business.<eos> Anyone ever tell you how pathetic that makes you look?
Your little pet project came through even better than you thought.<eos> You do work at E Corp. Yes?<eos> What is your position there?<eos> I never said that.<eos> I'm gonna confess.<eos> I've already called my lawyer.<eos> We can't beat them.<eos> No matter what we do, we will always lose to them.<eos> Next person's not gonna offer you food.<eos> They're gonna grab you off the street and throw you in a dark cell.
I'm not the dating kind.<eos> Yeah, me too, hon.<eos> We're a lot alike.<eos> Alexa, what are the color of your eyes?<eos> I don't have eyes, but my light ring has lots of colors.<eos> [sighs] Mine are gray.<eos> I think.<eos> [chuckles]<eos> Alexa, are you happy?<eos> I'm happy when I'm helping you.
That is, if you indeed believe that your time holds any value.<eos> You've been here close to four hours, and you never thought to walk out the door.<eos> [watch beeps]<eos> The door was locked.<eos> I've always found doors fascinating inventions.<eos> They hold the entry to unlimited imagination.<eos> Before you open any door, a world filled with possibilities sits right behind it.<eos> And it isn't until you open it they are realized.<eos> Such potential they bring to our minds.<eos> And yet a lock stopped you from all of that.
[watch beeps]<eos> You hurt that little girl.<eos> Makeup.<eos> It was part of the test.<eos> Empathy... or gullibility.<eos> Take your pick.<eos> Test?<eos> Why were you testing me?<eos> I know you have sensitive information, and I don't want you to release it.<eos> Normally, my associates would have murdered you by now.
So I'm not going to kill you.<eos> But I am going to prove to you why you need to drop this mission that you seem so stubbornly unable to let go of.<eos> Look, I don't know what you want.<eos> [watch beeps]<eos> But I'll give you the jump drive.<eos> Please, just let me go.<eos> Fear.<eos> How easy a quicksand of time people let that become.<eos> We both know that you could keep finding the plant's data.<eos> Like that penny that keeps turning up, your silly need for justice, revenge will rear its ugly head and encourage you to keep trying and eventually find a way to shut down my project.
We've been through this already.<eos> It must have been him. Mr. Robot.<eos> Elliot...<eos> I need to know.<eos> Are you able to handle this or not?<eos> You're here under great risk, not only to me, but to our plan.<eos> And your, um... disposition is very much concerning me.<eos> Joanna.<eos> Your wife.<eos> She's been looking for you.
Oh, my God.<eos> My God... 911. What's your emergency?<eos> Vincent had a punctured lung and a broken collarbone, but the doctors say he's gonna recover.<eos> The bad news is, he's gonna be arrested and put away for a long time for his stunt in D.C.<eos> God.<eos> Politicians love to teabag the rest of us.<eos> Too bad they can't take the heat.<eos> What your friend did was domestic terrorism in the eyes of the law.<eos> Not my friend.<eos> His associates, the ones we arrested, identified you as the ringleader of their outfit.
Yes, you did.<eos> No.<eos> I remember because the cops were asking every one of us questions about that night, and like I told them... cleaned up my station, and I went home.<eos> Derek, you said you were serious about punishing him.<eos> Yeah, but Joanna...<eos> Look at my face, Derek.<eos> You want the man that did this to me to do what he did and get away with it?<eos> But Joanna, I...<eos> Once you tell the cops your story, they're gonna ask you why you're just now confessing after months of silence.<eos> You're gonna tell them that you were scared... that Scott Knowles intimidated you.
On August the following year, you were kidnapped and taken to America. No.<eos> I was born in Brooklyn in a filthy hovel that my mother couldn't afford because you abandoned us. I'm sorry.<eos> That simply isn't true.<eos> I understand how upsetting this must be.<eos> You don't understand a thing about me.<eos> When Elsa stole you, I wanted her caught and you brought back.<eos> But I came to realize this program was wrong.<eos> Its intentions were pure, but its methods were cruel.<eos> I don't believe a word you're saying!<eos> Your mother was right to take you away, Josef.
You have to slowly start running again.<eos> Get ready, I'll adjust your training.<eos> I tried running yesterday, it got worse.<eos> If you don't heal quickly, your season's over.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> Ice it and see me in 3 days.<eos> Going somewhere?<eos> Screw off.<eos> Healed all of a sudden?<eos> What did I do to you?
And if you don't think so, I don't want to be part of this family.<eos> Okay, Jim.<eos> Breakfast is important, I misspoke.<eos> [Jim] Damn right, that breakfast is important.<eos> Watch your language in this house.<eos> You're dang right, it's important.<eos> No, no, Miranda.<eos> Miranda, you need to leave some for your sister, please.<eos> [sighs] Oh! I wish I was an only child.<eos> Aw, thanks, Miranda. I love you, too.
The Internet is necessary.<eos> All the most famous people in the world started off on the Internet.<eos> Justin Bieber, Susan Boyle, that cat that fell off the table when it got scared.<eos> I think you're better than all those people.<eos> -And the cat?<eos> -Is she not better than the cat?<eos> -Yeah, Mom, you left out the cat.<eos> -What cat?<eos> I am done with this breakfast and I'm gonna go check to see if we have had any views.<eos> And, honey, I want you to know, that even if no one watches your videos, that I am proud of you and I love you, no matter what.
What, are you saying I'm wrong?<eos> You're taking their side, Mom?<eos> Really? No! No, I mean, it's a...<eos> it's a very scary death threat, okay? Here, have a wiener.<eos> No, I can't eat that!<eos> What if someone poisoned it?<eos> -Safe.<eos> -Oh, thank God.<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> You only have to eat enough to see if it kills you.
[Patrick] In their mouth?<eos> [Jim] Put the gravel in their mouths!<eos> Okay, let's see what you did.<eos> [gasps] Patrick, you have the wrong fish-to-gravel ratio.<eos> That's an absurd amount of gravel to put in there, Patrick.<eos> I'm sorry, I haven't practiced this.<eos> -This one's alive.<eos> -Oh, my God, stop talking!<eos> Oh, Emily! Thank God you're here.<eos> I need you to be my body double and go outside so the killer gets you instead of me.

I have to follow my heart.<eos> Okay, well, I watched your video and it kind of gave me an idea--<eos> All right, Emily, let me stop you there.
It's from this amazing play that--<eos> [Emily] Nope, nope, nope. No, you don't.<eos> Emily, you're interrupting my audition.<eos> Okay, this was all a big mistake, and I should've known you two would do something like this.<eos> -Come on, we're leaving.<eos> -[Miranda whines] Emily.<eos> -Come on. -[Miranda] He wanted to see me perform.<eos> [Emily] I don't care.<eos> That was rude.<eos> Owen, I am here to confront you.

Your mother and I--<eos> -Are just friends.<eos> -[Keith] Oh no, no, no, no, Bethany. I can't hide these feelings inside any longer.<eos> Listen. Your mom and I... have been dating secretly ever since the funeral.<eos> [yells] What?<eos> [stammers] Okay, Miranda, I can explain.<eos> We're not really dating.<eos> No, I refuse this. You are not allowed in this house or in my mother!<eos> [Keith] I know. I know this is an uphill battle for me.<eos> And I have hurt you... and for that I'm so sorry.

I'll help you.
Do you see how crazy they are?<eos> I mean, we all understand if this is just too much for you.<eos> I'm just glad you got to see it before you and Mom got too serious.<eos> [stutters] This family is clearly broken.<eos> And what do you do when something's broken?<eos> It's time to move on.<eos> Uncle Jim!<eos> Patrick, just let him fall off the stage, okay? It's fine.<eos> -Just watch me, please... -Bethany... my little basket of fish and loaves...<eos> I can take you from this train wreck. What?
I'm really nervous for my audition at the magic club tomorrow, so I'm just practicing everywhere I can.<eos> -Magic club?<eos> It's this group of really prestigious magicians.<eos> And if I get in, I get all the perks.<eos> I'm talking, I get a certificate. I get to pay dues.<eos> I should get into that thing.<eos> That way I can skip to the magician phase and get famous faster.<eos> Okay, well, would you like me to teach you some tricks?<eos> Okay, I'll come over later and we can spend the whole day together doing magic.<eos> Yes, and, uh, then I will sign you up for the next auditions, which are in like six months, which gives us plenty of time to rehearse.
You know, usually when someone helps you get into art school you're supposed to say, "Thank you."<eos> Earth to Emily!<eos> I didn't get into the art school... okay?<eos> What?<eos> But I spent almost an hour fixing those paintings.<eos> [inhales] Fixing them?<eos> You ruined them.<eos> Did you not see all the glitter and the macaroni?<eos> Those paintings looked way better after I got to them.<eos> I was helping you.
Mom!<eos> [Miranda crying] Mom?<eos> Uncle Jim!<eos> Are you there?<eos> [Miranda] Hello?<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> What time is it?<eos> Well, if it isn't the little mother who couldn't be bothered to come to her own daughter's performance.<eos> Oh, did I... Did I sleep through it?<eos> I asked you for one thing, Mom.
Careful, that's hot.<eos> What is this?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. It's... It's tea.<eos> He said you wouldn't remember the events of the last few months, but I... didn't expect that.<eos> It's good.<eos> I like it.<eos> Yeah, I know you do.<eos> Blow on it, though, so you don't... burn your tongue.<eos> So this experimental procedure that they gave you... what was that all about?
- I... I can't tell you that.<eos> Because you don't remember.<eos> I don't, actually, but that's not why I can't tell you.<eos> Because it's a secret.<eos> That part you remember.<eos> All right, you know, it doesn't matter.<eos> It worked. And to be honest, Marcy, I'm just... I can't tell you how relieved I am.<eos> Why can't you tell me?<eos> Well, I can.<eos> What did MacLaren tell you about me? Everything.
- Yeah.<eos> It does.<eos> Take a step back.<eos> Take a step back, MacLaren!<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hey, Marce.<eos> I'm glad you recognize my voice.<eos> So here's something awkward...<eos> There's a man in my apartment who's looking for you, and he has a gun.<eos> Has he hurt you? Little bit.
- Hey, Marce.<eos> I'm glad you recognize my voice.<eos> So here's something awkward...<eos> There's a man in my apartment who's looking for you, and he has a gun.<eos> Has he hurt you? Little bit.<eos> A little bit, but he said he'd do a lot more if I didn't phone you right away.<eos> He did point the gun nozzle...<eos> You know, I know it's not "nozzle," but I can't think of the word right now.<eos> I wanna say barrel?<eos> You know, it's not coming to me, but he's got it pointed at the back of my head right now, so if you can imagine that... that's what's happening, and that's why I'm calling you.
- I can't.<eos> - Are you safe?<eos> Look, I know it's not the ideal time for me to make demands of you, but I need you to do as I ask.<eos> If something happened to you because of me... I don't know what I'd do.<eos> - You're serious.<eos> - Yes.<eos> All right, don't worry about me.<eos> I'll go right now.<eos> Just tell me that you're gonna be all right.<eos> I'll walk you to your car.
I just need you to step aside for a moment, and I will be out of your way soon, okay?<eos> Answer it.<eos> - Hey, Marce? - Duck.<eos> - What?<eos> - Duck down now.<eos> God.<eos> God.<eos> You shot him.<eos> What did you expect me to do?<eos> He was gonna kill you right after me.
I threw it out.<eos> Why?<eos> It held too many terrible memories of the night of his death.<eos> The night Ryo killed him.<eos> Too many terrible memories?<eos> Or too much of father's blood?<eos> Better to get rid of the evidence altogether.<eos> Deny it, mother.<eos> I did it for you.<eos> Your father was a monster, he exiled you.
You didn't answer the question.<eos> He could've killed me back when I was on his ship.<eos> - Oh. - Or taken me back to Zairon.<eos> It's funny about that, isn't it?<eos> How our ambush of his ship all of a sudden turns into a reverse ambush of ours.<eos> Almost like he'd been tipped off.<eos> It's not unreasonable to assume that he would've been travelling with an escort.<eos> Except that according to your boy General Drago, he was travelling alone.<eos> So either Drago's getting bad information or you're being played.<eos> I'm glad we didn't kill you.
Good luck.<eos> You're about to put your life on the line.<eos> I won't let you do it alone.<eos> I won't be alone.<eos> Drago has arranged for me to gain access to the palace.<eos> One of the side entrances will be left unguarded and once I'm inside I'll meet with him.<eos> And then we'll free Hiro.<eos> And what could go wrong.<eos> If I had the slightest doubt about him do you think I would take this risk?<eos> The fact that you're not letting any of us go with you suggests there is some doubt.
Your loyalty lies with the Emperor, not her.<eos> Do you remember the time we snuck off the palace grounds to visit the mochi festival?<eos> My father caught us, sent us to bed without supper.<eos> And then when it got dark, after everyone was asleep we went down to the kitchen and found that bowl of pudding?<eos> I was so hungry I snatched the spoon out of your hand and took the first bite.<eos> And when I asked you how it was, you told me,<eos> "Delicious."<eos> And I trusted you and also took a bite.<eos> And it turned out to be the chicken fat from that weekend's feast of fowl.<eos> Back then, I would've followed you to the ends of the universe.
That would be cheaper!<eos> And I wouldn't have to drive!<eos> And you are kind of mean.<eos> No one calls me mean.<eos> Moe, you're proving my point.<eos> Here we are talking, and you pull a shotgun on me.<eos> But there's never any bullets in this.<eos> Watch.<eos> Ha! Good gag, huh?<eos> Mmm, does that turn you on?
But I shouldn't call her.<eos> I should just drink it off at Moe's.<eos> You'll never hear the name Julia again.<eos> - Hi, I'm Julia.<eos> - Neh!<eos> I just wanted to introduce myself and tell you you've got a great husband.<eos> I've got a nice bicycle, too, but I keep a lock on it.<eos> I have no interest in... riding your bike.<eos> But I want you to know that your bike loves you as truly as a bike can.<eos> And, Marge, I love you as much as that bike.
How'd you get that scar?<eos> That's how.<eos> Of course.<eos> Remoh spelled backwards is Homer.<eos> It is?<eos> Uh, I mean, it's intentional.<eos> Now, I suppose you're wondering why I cornered the world beer supply.<eos> I've created a lava machine that will force the world to surrender to me.<eos> Then I want all the beer to celebrate.<eos> Well, we're gonna stop you.
The last thing she saw.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Mmm.<eos> What's wrong, honey?<eos> Oh, I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to.<eos> I appreciate that, and I'd like to talk. I'm just so drained after all the time I spend with the kids.<eos> What time?<eos> I took you to that colonial village.
They tell you it gets easier, but... it still leaves me messed up every time.<eos> I thought we weren't supposed to have outside contact.<eos> Purity of the data.<eos> Man, to hell with it.<eos> They don't know what it's like.<eos> We're the ones deep in it.<eos> They're just... on the outside watching dials.<eos> What are they?<eos> Forget-me-nots.<eos> They'll help even you out.
You're laying down on this just to sell a few extra tickets?<eos> Now, it's more than a few extra tickets, Al, and you know that.<eos> But that's not what this is about, and you know that, too.<eos> It's one thing to be the team that called up the first woman.<eos> It's another thing to be the team that picked the wrong woman and turned this whole thing into a disaster.<eos> - Oscar, it's my ball club!<eos> - No, Al, it's mine.<eos> And I know this because I bought it, and I kept the $700 million receipt.<eos> You're my manager, and you're a good one.<eos> I have never overridden you before, and I hope never to have to do it again.
Taking those long walks to the backstop to pick up your wild pitches.<eos> Come on, Mike, let's keep it moving.<eos> Sam, I need a moment.<eos> You're my favorite.<eos> You always have been.<eos> He's not my favorite.<eos> - Where were we?<eos> - Your speech.<eos> Okay. Here's what I got.<eos> I've been watching you this past week, Baker.
I didn't say it was pointless.<eos> I'm just trying to understand what's happening to me.<eos> With objective reasoning.<eos> If possible.<eos> What about the other Victor... the real one... the one out there?<eos> - What about him?<eos> - He's waiting for you.<eos> He's waiting for you to realize you'll be safer and happier with him.<eos> Why safer?<eos> Your crew will never fully accept you for what you are.
I gave that order, not you.<eos> We didn't have a choice Leslie.<eos> Paul was right in front of me and I didn't see him.<eos> If we have any chance in this place we need you with us.<eos> Hana... they asked me to make a choice,<eos> whether to keep pushing, or to bring you home.<eos> I tried to go back to that feeling, that feeling we had, staring up at those stars imagining what was beyond.<eos> Unnie, do you remember that recurring dream I used to have?<eos> Walking along the regolith under the twin Moons before I even knew it was Mars I was dreaming about.<eos> When I think about you up there, if it had been you in that corridor...
I don't know how that happened.<eos> Let me get you a cloth, please.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I wasn't sure you'd come.<eos> It sounded urgent.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Another fight with your father?<eos> The way we met... That was no coincidence, was it?<eos> My father sent you to persuade me to stay.
It has to do with the fact that I'm trying to get you out of here.<eos> What?<eos> I might not be able to do anything about the money, but maybe what I can do is make it so that you can be with your family.<eos> No.<eos> - What do you mean, no?<eos> - No. They're already going after our money.<eos> I don't want to do anything that's gonna mess with Jill's deal.<eos> Listen to me. That deal is as solid as a rock.<eos> I wrote it myself; they can't take it away from her any more than they can take my deal away from me.<eos> But you need to tell me exactly what Cahill said to you when he told you to turn on Sutter.
Sorry, Frank.<eos> Don't worry about it, kid.<eos> I got your back.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Everyone knows guards are the last one to find out anything.<eos> So if word were spreading, I wouldn't be finding out about it from him.<eos> He just did that because you told him to, because you want to remind me of what's gonna happen if Harvey lets you down.<eos> Well, then, I guess you got the message loud and clear.<eos> Good luck to me on my hearing tomorrow.<eos> Did you do what I asked you to do?
Oh, there must've been a mix-up in the paperwork.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You're holding it up because he's threatening to sue you.<eos> Oh, you're right.<eos> And if doesn't drop this thing and agree to walk away, I'm gonna dump his deal altogether.<eos> Sean, let his deal go through.<eos> Once he gets out, he's not gonna follow through on this thing.<eos> "Oh, Sean, put down your gun.<eos> "I promise Mike'll put his down too.<eos> "And you can trust the both of us, 'cause neither of us has ever lied to you before."
God, I can't wait to see you.<eos> I can't wait to see you either.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I, um--I just wanted to talk to you about my death row client.<eos> How can I help?<eos> They offered us a deal for him to get out in five years, and Jessica wants to take it.<eos> But I want to fight for him.<eos> Let me guess, she wants to present a united front.<eos> She does.<eos> Well, I'm not sure how I can help you other than to tell you to follow your gut.
That's a stupid question after what you pulled at my parole hearing.<eos> - You didn't deserve to get out.<eos> - Neither did you.<eos> And now you're not gonna.<eos> What, you're gonna kill me in this cell?<eos> There are guards out there.<eos> It just doesn't sink in for you, does it?<eos> Those guards out there work for me.<eos> See, Mike, I wasn't gonna let what happened last time happen this time.<eos> No one's gonna come run helping you at the last second, because they're all locked up tight in their bunks.
No way.<eos> You don't have the power to make that happen.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But my friend at the SEC sure does.<eos> Why are you so upset, Frank?<eos> Does it have anything to do with the fact that every inmate in there knows that you're an informant, and you'll be lucky to make it through your first night?<eos> You think I'm afraid?<eos> I think you're shitting in your pants right now, which is why I think you'll be interested in what's behind door number two.<eos> You stay here at Danbury, you do five more years, and if Mike so much as gets a pebble in his shoe, you go back to door number one.<eos> I'll take that hatred in your face as a yes, 'cause it's the same look you had the last time I put you away.
- I'm glad, but I wouldn't have left without saying good-bye.<eos> - I didn't just come here to say good-bye.<eos> I came to see what you think about me coming with you.<eos> - What about the firm?<eos> - I'm leaving the firm.<eos> - Jessica, if you're walking away from everything for me--<eos> - No, I'm not doing this just for you.<eos> I'm doing this for me.<eos> I don't want to be a corporate lawyer anymore.<eos> So, if you don't want me to come to Chicago with you, I won't.
I don't know what I'd do without you.<eos> And that wasn't even the hardest part.<eos> Francesca had a little brother.<eos> Roberto?<eos> My name's Jennifer.<eos> I'm with the FBI.<eos> You know what that is, right?<eos> You need anything?<eos> Your mom said you haven't eaten.<eos> We can get you whatever you want.
Diesel.<eos> But I haven't been able to get it restarted since the nukes.<eos> We also have solar arrays, but they took a hit too.<eos> With some help, I might be able to get them restarted.<eos> So why'd you leave?<eos> Well I was here by myself.<eos> All the repairs were a two-man job.<eos> So after the last of my batteries ran out, I had a choice.<eos> I could either go out and find some help or stay here and die alone.<eos> Guess it was a good thing I found you.
Kaya?<eos> Fear... Fear...<eos> This Escorpion is starting to piss me off.<eos> Who the hell are these guys?<eos> This man was shot in the heart, not the head.<eos> But he didn't turn.<eos> He's a blend.<eos> Look at the other side of his face.<eos> So when blends die, they don't turn.<eos> Yeah. And zombies ignore you like you're one of them.
See exactly what we're working with.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm just hungry.<eos> I'm gonna get some crickets.<eos> Looking for these?<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - 10K!<eos> He's bit!<eos> He's bit!<eos> 10K, let me help you!
He's waiting for you.<eos> He's here, Sir.<eos> You know, the funny thing about confinement, and I speak from experience, Gives you time to think about the big things.<eos> You know, life, it's purpose.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> How do I fit in?<eos> Did you find that?<eos> I only thought about how much I hate your guts.<eos> Hate my guts?<eos> Those are hurtful words for the man who found you starving and near death.
Escorpion killed your family.<eos> You were an undercover cop named Vasquez.<eos> And I killed your family.<eos> You're lying!<eos> No.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> But I lied to you before.<eos> In Mexico.<eos> When I told you I didn't remember killing your wife or your little girl.

You gettin' out of here?<eos> What?<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> So what's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's not important.<eos> Your lawyer shows up without you knowing about it and it's not important?<eos> Come on, do I look like I was born yesterday?<eos> I just said it is not important.<eos> And I'm sorry I left you hanging, but you wouldn't even have this job without me.
And that... that we were still good.<eos> Now that I have something to take my mind off our situation and connect me to you at the same time, yeah, we're better than good.<eos> [solemn music]<eos> All right, can you do me a favor and transfer me to Donna?<eos> Of course.<eos> Can I ask why?<eos> I only get one phone call, and I'm pretty sure she had something to do with the idea of you imagining us working together, so I just want to thank her.<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.
Mike, what's going on?<eos> I'm not taking the deal, Donna.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> What's not simple about it?<eos> Harvey said that if you--<eos> I don't care what Harvey said.<eos> Because what he didn't say is that if I do what he wants and someone finds out, then I may never get back to Rachel at all.<eos> Harvey would never let them find out--<eos> Donna, look, I called you so that I didn't want to have this argument with him.

Then leave him a dozen more, and while you're at it, don't leave your desk until he calls back.<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> - Why the hell not?<eos> Because I'm making sure that Louis doesn't blow it with another tenant today.<eos> - Then get Rachel to do that.<eos> - Harvey, Rachel has law school.<eos> And besides that, this is something that I want to do.<eos> Donna, I don't give a shit about Louis and his tenants.<eos> Well, I do.<eos> Because we all said that we would give everything we had to get this place back to where it was, and right now, Jessica has a prospect waiting for you in the conference room.
Hey, what happened?<eos> I'd say you should see the other guy, Mike, but there were three of them.<eos> Oh, come on, hey, get up.<eos> I thought you said you were gonna stay in the open.<eos> [groans]<eos> Everyone needs to go to the bathroom, and Gallo and his buddies were waiting for me when I got here.<eos> Come on, we got to get you to the infirmary.<eos> No, no!<eos> We can't.<eos> You need someone to look at you.
Strat, Strat, Strat.<eos> Listen to me, okay, bud?<eos> I need you to take some deep breaths.<eos> Ready?<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, heads up!<eos> - You.<eos> - Oh, thank God.<eos> God, have mercy!<eos> No, not you!

Effie.<eos> Let's go to your solo, second bridge.<eos> You need to give this a lot more soul here, honey.<eos> Channel your inner Aretha and let those "No's" rip.<eos> I know, right? So moving.<eos> Sing it, Effie!<eos> - Yo, you just hit 10,000 views!<eos> - No shit!<eos> Let me see this.<eos> All these comments are about you, though.
But you do not have to become the monster he's making you out to be.<eos> I've seen you with the other inmates.<eos> They look up to you.<eos> Ruiz?<eos> Stratman?<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Okay, enough.<eos> You have to tell me what's going on.<eos> What?<eos> Why there is an army of lemmings dressed like you, moving out here.
It's not the right time.<eos> When is there gonna be a better time? !<eos> This whole valley feels like a tornado is gonna tear it to pieces.<eos> There's a man buried out in the desert,<eos> - a man you killed.<eos> - Keep your voice down.<eos> You're shouting again in your sleep.<eos> Do you know that?<eos> You're shouting and screaming every night.<eos> And it kills me to think that our boys are gonna wind up just like you.
You goddamned whites.<eos> Strong magic.<eos> Look what it's done to my people.<eos> It's not magic.<eos> I'm pretty sure it's smallpox.<eos> This... This smallpox only kills red men?<eos> When I was little, a doctor came with a needle.<eos> He put good medicine in my arm.<eos> It's supposed to protect me and my family.<eos> This medicine only helped you, yes?
- So good. - You got it, Jonas.<eos> - You're doing so good. - You got it, buddy. Stay here.<eos> - You're okay. - You're okay.<eos> - It's okay. - You're doing good, buddy.<eos> - Don't worry about a thing. - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> - Gonna be okay. - All right.<eos> Wait. Wait. Almost.<eos> All right. You're wrapped. You're good.<eos> Let's take him to the other room.<eos> You and Neptune, get that other sofa. Go.
We are all in this together, Eli.<eos> Now you know it.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Bug?<eos> Oh, baby girl.<eos> I'm so glad to see you.<eos> You're so brave.<eos> I was pretty scared.<eos> You done good.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
I was pretty scared.<eos> You done good.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> Your granddaddy's been worried sick about you.<eos> Better go show your face to him.<eos> Your people saved us.<eos> Saved my kids.<eos> Granddaddy!<eos> Jeannie Anne McCullough, come here and give your granddaddy a hug.<eos> Oh! Look at you.
You!
You!<eos> You.
If you wanna stay Regent for long, or even if you just wanna stay alive,<eos> you best keep that in mind.<eos> Our spiritual path is one of transformation.<eos> Youth grows into wisdom, and pride becomes devotion.<eos> Yes, two souls join together<eos> as one.<eos> So long as these totems remain whole, then so will the love you pledge today,<eos> no matter what the gods have in store.<eos> Duties.<eos> So proud of you.
You know I'm not the religious type.<eos> Yeah, but your Cogs are.<eos> Almost half of them worship the same gods we do.<eos> Showing you're a friend to the Totemists will help pacify your own workers.<eos> And who says they're not already?<eos> News travels slower out in the wilds, but even I've heard the stories...<eos> Cogs abandoning your poppy fields to go work for The Widow?<eos> I'm handling The Widow.<eos> But that's not what people think.<eos> Remember what I taught you, you have to either make them love you, or fear you.
But that's not what people think.<eos> Remember what I taught you, you have to either make them love you, or fear you.<eos> Perhaps I could help.<eos> Teach you to think more like a Baron.<eos> Well, I am a Baron!<eos> And I am a damn good one.<eos> I don't need anyone's help, especially yours.<eos> Such ingratitude and arrogance.<eos> Arrogance?<eos> Last time I saw you, Mother, you told me I wouldn't last a month without you.
In fact, I tell you what. We're a pretty good team, like thunder and lightning, hammer and nails.<eos> More like ball and chain.<eos> I'm sorry, is that Clipper humor?<eos> Very droll.<eos> Maybe you should stick to punching people.<eos> Do you ever stop talking?<eos> - What?<eos> - Shut up.<eos> It's nipping.<eos> Not so smug now, are you?
What use is a man with a toothache when he's got a wench?<eos> I would say that any harping cock who prefers ale to some female pleasures is a man who needs drink.<eos> - What do you say, lads?<eos> - I could stop if I wanted.<eos> I just don't want to.<eos> And which one of you men believes him?<eos> There. The beer is down.<eos> That's not stopping.<eos> That is pausing.<eos> You think I can't stop?
That same man told me De La Warr returned to Jamestown a year ago.<eos> He had a map obtained from the Portuguese with two gold mines pricked down on it.<eos> Do you suppose I have the map, Davie?<eos> You're headed for the mountains.<eos> No intention of turning back.<eos> Suppose that same man, Breerling, suppose he took the map.<eos> Suppose that's why he were here.<eos> Suppose that's why he were killed.<eos> If I had a map, would I be sitting here now?<eos> I ain't arguing with you, Davie.
I don't doubt it.<eos> If we find gold, demons are sure to appear.<eos> Did they tell you where the caves were?<eos> Why don't you tell me where you're headed?<eos> When Newport set out for the mountains, he took with him two goldsmiths, two refiners, and a jeweller.<eos> When that jeweller was sick I kept him alive for nine days, fed him, carried him out of the settlement.<eos> He drew me a map of where they'd been, in the dirt.<eos> As best as he could remember.<eos> That's cast in my mind now.<eos> Then you and I, my friend, we're on our way to meet the demons.
Perhaps you might write a letter?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have.<eos> Where's your smiles gone, woman?<eos> Can your husband not have a beer without you wearing a face like a chicken's arse?<eos> Seems I have me a man prefers drink to love.<eos> What, you think I can't have a drink and still delight you?<eos> There ain't much delight in dog's breath and a sorry cock.<eos> I will show you sorry.<eos> I will be a good wife to you.
I won't let it.<eos> Are you willing to let Silas hang for something he did not do?<eos> Perhaps there's justice in it.<eos> Massinger came to speak with me.<eos> If I agree to his terms, he'll tell the marshal that I didn't steal the musket.<eos> You must not give him any land, Silas.<eos> Trading weapons is a hanging offence.<eos> What other choice do we have, Alice?<eos> Well, there must be someone else who can speak the language.<eos> He can tell them it was not you gave him the musket.

I've been out since second sunrise.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Round them up, big fella.<eos> 'Kezzia, please don't come in.<eos> We're having a little tiny Vardy problem.'<eos> Me and my Vardies have just pollinated three miles of wheat.<eos> - 'You've got to keep smiling.'<eos> - Got to what?<eos> - It's the Vardies.<eos> - God, what's wrong with you?
More people die.<eos> There are kids living rough near here, they may well be next on the menu.<eos> Do you want to help me?<eos> Do you want to stand here stamping your foot?<eos> Because let me tell you something. I'm 2,000 years old... and I have never had the time for the luxury of outrage.<eos> What do you mean, "on the menu"?<eos> - Is this where you live?<eos> But there's no-one here.<eos> Good work!<eos> Except you, Dot.
And no staring like gapeseeds when the lady talks peculiar.<eos> It's rude.<eos> Get a load of you lot.<eos> Cute as!<eos> Come on, then!<eos> You going to tell us what we're here for?<eos> A very long time, I hope.<eos> Go on.<eos> Eat as much as you like.<eos> You, boy!
Margaret Thatcher?<eos> Harriet Jones? Wilson?<eos> Eden?

But why would he pick up insects from the garden and bring them in to see his ill daughter?<eos> Everyone loves insects.<eos> I don't!<eos> They're fascinating!<eos> OK. Secondly, he's not wood.<eos> He's just like us. He's...<eos> Yes...<eos> So, if he's her father, and she was preserved 70 years ago...<eos> SONIC SCREWDRIVER TRILLS<eos> You... Oh!
Betty, move in with me.<eos> You have a wife.<eos> Whom I adore.<eos> You're insane.<eos> No.<eos> I'm quite rational, actually.<eos> Monogamy is not natural.<eos> It is a construct of religious authority.<eos> And a foolish faith in authority, my dear Betty, is the worst enemy of truth.<eos> Truth being that rules don't apply to you?

You were right.<eos> It is a difficult language to grasp.<eos> Why are you not in school?<eos> I've decided to go to Zurich Polytechnic instead.<eos> Zurich Polytechnic?<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You cannot expect to enter university<eos> - without finishing your studies.<eos> - They'll admit me... if I pass the entrance exam in June.<eos> I-I was hoping I could stay here with... with you and Mother and Maja while I study.
I have teaching offers abroad.<eos> Oxford.<eos> Princeton.<eos> Ha! I've known you for over a decade, Albert.<eos> You despise British formality, you despise American exceptionalism.<eos> I also despise German nationalism.<eos> So do most Germans.<eos> The country has declared a national holiday for Walther's funeral tomorrow, for God's sake.<eos> Elsa is overreacting.<eos> Do you know what I find extraordinary about you, Fritz Haber?
Why should someone's vocation define his intellect?<eos> - Well said, darling.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Fine, fine, but his treatise on God is hearsay.<eos> "Natura Naturans?" Please.<eos> And what does it even mean?<eos> It means God and Nature are one and the same.<eos> I am a certified teacher now, if you need a Latin tutor.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Albert may take you up on that.
Here you are, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "The surest way to corrupt a youth is to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently."<eos> Nietzsche?<eos> Excellent.<eos> "If you step on enough toes, one day you'll trip."<eos> Confucius?<eos> Close. My father.<eos> Albert.<eos> A letter for you.
It's been approved.<eos> I'm officially stateless.<eos> So now you have no passport?<eos> That seems reckless.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because nationalism is an infantile disease.<eos> The measles of mankind.<eos> Where on Earth did you get such an idea?<eos> Papa, you didn't.<eos> I'm proud of you, Albert.
So why not shorten the length of the conductor instead of trying to change the speed of the rotor?<eos> How the hell do we do that?<eos> Wire cutters.<eos> Try it now.<eos> I think the patient will survive.<eos> You should have seen him, Pauline!<eos> He's here for one week... one week... and he fixes all our problems.<eos> We should have school vacations more often.<eos> Albert. Albert.<eos> I'm very proud of you.
- Dear God.<eos> What in God's name have they been teaching you in Switzerland?<eos> You sound like a communist.<eos> I'm not a communist, I'm an Internationalist.<eos> Inter...<eos> What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> I wouldn't expect you<eos> - to understand.<eos> - Really?<eos> Oh, why? Because I'm not as brilliant as you, I suppose?
And, uh, oh, I translate:<eos> "I will enroll in Zurich Polytechnic.<eos> I will stay there four years and study physics and mathematics.<eos> I suppose I will become a teacher in these fields, focusing on the theoretical parts."<eos> Your vocabulary is elementary, the syntax simplistic, you did not use the future simple.<eos> But I think it is an excellent plan.<eos> Welcome to Zurich Polytechnic.<eos> Thank you, sir, thank you.<eos> Good-bye, Albert.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you for everything.<eos> Well have a safe journey.<eos> - Marie, wait!<eos> - Just go, Albert.<eos> Please!<eos> Marie, I'm going to write to you.<eos> And Zurich's not that far.<eos> - I'll visit.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I am happy for you.
- It's Wags.<eos> Wags, where you been?<eos> Wags, I've been calling you.<eos> Call you back.<eos> You haven't been drinking.<eos> Your eyes are clear.<eos> Let me see.<eos> It's not shaking.<eos> I want to get this out.<eos> When I started here, I made a promise to you, and you to me.
He told him to...<eos> McKinnon called me.<eos> Chef Ryan has everything set up for your new friend.<eos> He's outside.<eos> A little home court hospitality?<eos> I need you to do something for me.<eos> I want to take the business to the next level.<eos> To raise capital.<eos> You never even have to ask me before writing a check.<eos> No, I don't want to just take it from you.
I can't, Bobby.<eos> I deal with Nigeria all the time.<eos> Same with all the primes.<eos> Their sovereign wealth fund.<eos> None of us can be seen taking down a government.<eos> Look, if it's weak enough to go, it's nobody's fault.<eos> All the same. What about levering up?<eos> No, if I go to the banks, word will get out, they'll crack my position.<eos> Of course.<eos> You need to go to others like you who are free to operate in the margins.
So, which is the more powerful driver... boning me, or your own self-interest?<eos> Fuck.<eos> In.<eos> Yep.<eos> This is Everett.<eos> He's gonna run you through the research.<eos> My treat.<eos> Is Mommy coming home to take us to school?<eos> No, sweetheart.<eos> Remember, I told you.
But we don't.<eos> We're not perfect.<eos> You know, we're just two people trying and... often failing to figure out the best way to be.<eos> And I made some mistakes along the way.<eos> Mistakes that we're all paying for.<eos> So if you want to blame somebody, blame me, not your mother.<eos> European auto manufactures use a ton of zinc.<eos> Not a literal ton, just a hyperbole for how much zinc can be found...<eos> Good morning.<eos> Not for you, Bobby.
Fuck, you told him to?<eos> I thought he was free-balling.<eos> Conditions are right to get going again.<eos> We'll tail the shit out of the auction.<eos> The fucking Feds can spare the 15 bips.<eos> Then we can talk about the 26-weeks.<eos> We have to get some volume going now.<eos> So relax.<eos> That'll do it.<eos> When I started here, I made a promise to you, and you to me.
He walked right past me.<eos> Fucking DK'd me like I was a ghost.<eos> Turns out, he has early-onset Alzheimer's.<eos> Can't even go out by himself now.<eos> His wife left him.<eos> His kids don't come around.<eos> It was... fucked.<eos> He was there, but he wasn't there... a carcass with no further purpose.<eos> What you saw would have brought up issues of mortality and diminished utility for anyone.<eos> You saw your hero, a man you deemed better than you, laid low.
It was... fucked.<eos> He was there, but he wasn't there... a carcass with no further purpose.<eos> What you saw would have brought up issues of mortality and diminished utility for anyone.<eos> You saw your hero, a man you deemed better than you, laid low.<eos> That's empathy.<eos> Why did his plight cut you so deep?<eos> What made you so vulnerable to this idea of fading away?<eos> Axe hired a fucking Chief of Staff.<eos> Her name is Steph Reed.<eos> So now he doesn't need you anymore.

But you're not dead.<eos> Which means it is time to pivot.<eos> To evolve into what it is you'll become next.<eos> Wendy reassembled me, piece by piece, on that bench.<eos> That's what she does.<eos> And I decided I had to give you the chance to make the change here you need to.<eos> To modernize.<eos> Optimize.<eos> To put this old horse out to pasture.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm sorry about Phil, but this place doesn't fucking run without you.

You need me to go on?<eos> So, why would an investment bank put serious money into it?<eos> I all but told you ahead of time, but you wouldn't listen.<eos> Now you've heard it, but it's too late.<eos> You weren't ready.<eos> Now, I gotta go into New York to try and save my fucking quarter.<eos> Mr. Axelrod, I'll be in to get you in two minutes to go on the air. Thank you.<eos> And thank you, Larry.<eos> You locked in on how you want to do it?<eos> Yeah. When I follow you on, I'll back whatever you said.
- I... Hey, Jess.<eos> Hey, Damon.<eos> It's great to see you've moved on already.<eos> After only two-and-a-half months of not dating.<eos> Three-and-a-half months, actually.<eos> But...<eos> Hi. I'm Heather.<eos> I'm sure you are.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - You tell me. - Yeah.
I'm mingling.<eos> Okay, this is like, old money, theater-subscribing Manhattan.<eos> These are so not your people.<eos> Have you been talking to them about Damon?<eos> Yeah, yeah, but...<eos> I'm going through a process right now.<eos> Okay, I'm standing in my own truth.<eos> - Dude, you need to get out.<eos> - I am out.<eos> No, no, you need to go on a date.
You're booing me when I'm being honest?<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry. That was rude.<eos> How do you pay your rent?<eos> I work at a non-profit in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> I teach public school kids how to write and produce their own plays.<eos> So, how do you pay your rent?<eos> I, uh, I live in deep Bushwick.<eos> Like, deep, deep, deep Bushwick.<eos> What about you?
I invented an app.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, well, thanks.<eos> This was interesting.<eos> In, like, an anthropological way.<eos> I'm gonna take that as a compliment.<eos> Yeah, I guess you could.<eos> Look, I don't want to disappoint you or anything, but... I don't think we should make out.<eos> Don't worry. I gave up on that idea halfway through the meal.<eos> I enjoyed being honest with you.
Damon?<eos> - What the hell are you doing out here?<eos> - I've been thinking, all right?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah, I made a lot of mistakes.<eos> Damon.<eos> I should have never let you go.<eos> Damon, this is literally so crazy.<eos> Please come off the ledge.<eos> I can't. I won't go on without you.
- Yeah. We had dinner.<eos> We, um, stayed over at my place and we had dessert?<eos> The divorced guy.<eos> Oh, wow. Shit.<eos> Sorry, I forgot that was your name.<eos> No, sure, that's understandable.<eos> Uh, how are you?<eos> It's, um, kind of a weird moment for me.<eos> I guess I'm okay.<eos> - What about you?
- What about you?<eos> - Oh, I'm great. Thanks for asking.<eos> Listen, I had a terrific time the other night.<eos> Oh, my God. Is this a booty call? No.<eos> No. No.<eos> Do people still say booty call?<eos> This is totally a booty call.<eos> Oh, Boone.<eos> Okay, I guess it's kind of a booty call.<eos> But I did enjoy spending time with you.
- No. I don't want to talk to him.<eos> You just prefer to obsess about what he's doing online?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, I do.<eos> - Don't think that's very healthy.<eos> Well, that's coming from a guy who checks his ex-wife's Instagram like a thousand times a day.<eos> - Oh, true, that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, what do you think would happen if you unfollowed him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you think would happen if you unfollowed her?
- Sweet.<eos> - Let's do it on three.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - One, two, three...<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Okay, how do you feel?<eos> I already hate it.<eos> I want to know what's going on already.<eos> What about you?
That is a good porn.<eos> That's a good form of porn.<eos> Also, um, I was wondering what you were up to this weekend?<eos> You were, were you?<eos> Yes, I was, I was.<eos> I, um, I'm actually gonna be in Ohio for my little sister's baby shower.<eos> Oh, a lot of new information there.<eos> What, you're from Ohio?<eos> Yes. I am, unfortunately.<eos> It's weird I know more about your ex-boyfriend than I do you.
Maybe... um, when you get back into town, we could go on a real date?<eos> Well, that depends, Boone. What's your idea of a real date?<eos> Hot dogs and laser tag?<eos> - Um, I'm busy.<eos> - I'm joking.<eos> Something brilliant.<eos> No, we'll, um...<eos> We'll have a great time, I promise.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I'll go on a real date with you.
We saw you out here circling around the block, it's...<eos> It's sad, man.<eos> I'm what...<eos> Well, you can tell Mandy that I happen to be on the phone, arranging a date with a girl, a woman, who is a wonderful playwright from Ohio.<eos> I didn't even know that I was in your neighborhood.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm not gonna tell her any of that.<eos> Fine.<eos> Don't tell her.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> You know, she still has a great deal of affection for you.
- Oh, my big sister's here!<eos> - I know. Yay!<eos> She's here.<eos> - Yup. I'm gonna go change.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let me get this.<eos> Yeah. Thank you, Kenny.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - All right.<eos> See you later. - Do you have heels, babe?
No, mine is called "Hi, Mom."<eos> - Have you heard about it?<eos> - No.<eos> Basically, we make it seem like you're staying in touch with your parents or whoever, without you having to stay in touch with your parents or whoever.<eos> That's insane.<eos> How do you do that?<eos> We study users' text feeds, and social media.<eos> And we generate a weekly personalized message in their own voice from their own cellphone number.<eos> A typical one would be, "Hi, Mom."<eos> I was just thinking about you. Thought I'd say hi.
- You don't think it's awful?<eos> - No, I think it's trash.<eos> But it's cool that you do it.<eos> - That's awesome.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Do you think I could get a hook up for like my mom and my sister?<eos> - How thoughtful of you.<eos> - Do you know a guy? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I, sort of, know a guy.<eos> How about you?
- Thanks.<eos> Do you think I could get a hook up for like my mom and my sister?<eos> - How thoughtful of you.<eos> - Do you know a guy? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I, sort of, know a guy.<eos> How about you?<eos> Tell me about one of your plays.<eos> Nah, let's just change the subject.<eos> I don't...<eos> I thought theater was all you cared about.
Knock, knock.<eos> Hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to apologize.<eos> About what?<eos> I'm really, really sorry for making you feel bad about wanting to spend time with your dad.<eos> Do you mind if I sit down?<eos> Well, this is a really cool room.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I thought about you a lot this weekend.

What's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm just going to London.<eos> Okay, what for?<eos> I've been invited by the Donmar Warehouse Theater to teach at a children's playmaking workshop and direct a stage reading of one of my plays.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, congratulations!<eos> - Thank you. - Oh!<eos> Uh, anyway, I got you something.
- Yeah.<eos> I wasn't too over the top?<eos> No, you were perfect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I thought it was such a great character.<eos> Thank you so much for casting me.<eos> No, you... You were amazing.<eos> You're so good.<eos> Uh-oh. - What?<eos> - Don't look behind you. Don't, don't.
- Don't look behind you. Don't, don't.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Just keep cool.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You've got this.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I didn't know you were coming tonight.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, I know how much this means to you.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I didn't know you were coming tonight.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, I know how much this means to you.<eos> That's...<eos> How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good?<eos> I'm good, yeah.<eos> You?
I have no idea what to say.<eos> Ain't an expert on love "or what on God's earth" "would compel two completely different animals"<eos> "A home is where you eat, sleep, raise children."<eos> "Where you feel safe enough to think about the future."<eos> "That's what I see when I look at these two."<eos> "I see home."<eos> Sam Elliot in "Long Desert."<eos> It's the second movie I ever did.<eos> Maybe I'll use the accent.<eos> I wish I was going with you.
None of us do.<eos> Do you sleep with a lot of people?<eos> Is that important?<eos> Not really.<eos> It's just... what you did with me was so specific, and you seemed to know a lot about it.<eos> I'm just wondering how you got there.<eos> And what damage I must have endured.<eos> If that's what it is.<eos> Is that what you want it to be?<eos> Me acting out, you going along for the ride?

Come so we can have an actual conversation in person.<eos> With the investor, I mean.<eos> I am gonna be back east this weekend<eos> - for a wedding.<eos> - What?<eos> But I don't know if I can come into the city.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Of course you can.<eos> Megan, it's meant to be.<eos> I can't do this without you.
Kyle, think about what you're doing.<eos> This violence, it's a regression.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But at least now I see you.<eos> You're a fraud.<eos> Don't come near me again.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> Hey, I...<eos> I know it's last minute, but... can I go to the wedding with you?
I figured you would have hit your finger at least once or busted a nail or something.<eos> You wanna see me embarrass myself, put me in front of a Ram's game.<eos> I will yell my head off.<eos> You wouldn't have to do any yelling. Liking the Rams would be embarrassing enough.<eos> Giants country.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - My agent's calling.<eos> - "My agent."<eos> Look who's gone all Hollywood on us now.<eos> She's worse than you are.
Way worse.<eos> You guys got a great place.<eos> I can see why Megan spent so much time here.<eos> So, in general, she's as happy as she looks?<eos> I think so.<eos> Good.<eos> Keep it going.<eos> You don't want me to have to get on a plane.<eos> "Please, Billy. Please don't send me away."<eos> "I was made for you.
I forgot how small this place is.<eos> Your closet's literally bigger than this room.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Kinda nice for the weekend.<eos> My God, look at you.<eos> Let me guess:<eos> Braces, ombré hair, and a choker?<eos> Yep.<eos> God, you're in so many of these.<eos> Kind of a second family for you?
Really?<eos> Yeah. Sympathy weight.<eos> He's just getting a head start. It's sweet.<eos> He's excited about the baby?<eos> Yeah, totally.<eos> I mean, we both are.<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> I feel like... all of a sudden the next five years of my life are planned out for me.<eos> Sometimes it completely freaks me out.<eos> So how serious is it between you and Kyle?
It's...<eos> It's no worries.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I'm suddenly exhausted. You're getting married tomorrow. Jesus Christ.<eos> It's a California term I learned.<eos> - I'm gonna go to bed. - Kay.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Love you too.<eos> Your god complex should treat you better.<eos> Well, for once, I agree with you.
Just so you know.<eos> So buckle up.<eos> A wedding is more than a ceremony between two people.<eos> It's between all of us.<eos> We all have a responsibility to foster and support the love between Tessa and Bryan.<eos> It's a dissociative enactogen.<eos> Synthetic psilocybin, essentially.<eos> Shrooms.<eos> With no side effects.<eos> Always good talking to you, Isaac.

The shepherd has lost his flock.<eos> How is he going to get them back?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't care.<eos> This is not where I wanna be.<eos> I know.<eos> Through there.<eos> That's where you wanna be.<eos> Terry?<eos> Is that you?
This is not where I wanna be.<eos> I know.<eos> Through there.<eos> That's where you wanna be.<eos> Terry?<eos> Is that you?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I want you.
10th graders.<eos> My God.<eos> My God, yeah, that's... that's great.<eos> And you're obviously doing amazing.<eos> It's crazy, right?<eos> - We're all grown up.<eos> - That is crazy.<eos> It's just sad.<eos> Evan could be here with us. You know?<eos> He'd be really proud of you.
Excuse me.<eos> You gotta tell me what's going on.<eos> You've been acting like this all day.<eos> It's just being back.<eos> It's a lot.<eos> Is it okay if we don't talk about it?<eos> - Just dance with me. - Okay.<eos> - Megan... - I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> You just looked at me like I was some kind of monster.<eos> - It's not about you, Kyle.
But that's not acting.<eos> You gonna tell me what acting is now?<eos> Acting is accessing real feelings and bringing them to life through the text.<eos> You gotta have feelings to access 'em, buddy.<eos> I have feelings.<eos> Just not the right ones.<eos> Sophie Marchuk died and I felt inconvenienced.<eos> I know.<eos> Connor blew his brains out in front of me and I felt relief.<eos> And you're right. I didn't fight for you.
Yeah? What's that got to do with me?<eos> We want you to come with us.<eos> I'm sorry, you guys, I'm out of the game.<eos> I built a sweet little life here for myself.<eos> Me and Josh, we got everything we need.<eos> I have HBO Go, Netflix. I have a working SodaStream.<eos> What more could I want?<eos> Come on, Luce.<eos> What about the old days?<eos> No one partied like you did.
Whoa. What's his job?<eos> My roommate's the DJ.<eos> I can get us all on the list.<eos> - Oh, cool. - Yep.<eos> It's too bad you got rid of all your "going out" tops.<eos> Oh. Did I?<eos> Wh... what's going on, Lucy?<eos> I'm going out for a bit.<eos> - Dancing. - Oh.<eos> I... I thought those days were behind you.
Oh. Did I?<eos> Wh... what's going on, Lucy?<eos> I'm going out for a bit.<eos> - Dancing. - Oh.<eos> I... I thought those days were behind you.<eos> Honey...<eos> Listen.<eos> I just got to do this one more time, okay?<eos> Don't you trust me?<eos> Oh, yes, of course I trust you.
Uh, actually, I'm a graphic designer, so I made it.<eos> - Oh, that's awesome.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Actually... weird coincidence, because I'm looking for a new logo to be designed.<eos> Oh. I'd love to check out your stuff.<eos> Is it cool if I get your number?<eos> Oh, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> Thanks.<eos> For you.
Hold on for the ride of your life.<eos> Dearest Margaret, the canvas ripped again.<eos> At times, it seems my dream of building an all-canvas shoe may never come to pass.<eos> But, as ever, I toil on.<eos> With everlasting love,<eos> Archibald Converse.<eos> Converse.<eos> Like the shoe!<eos> I think we lost them.<eos> I couldn't have done this without you.
- Hi.<eos> Sturdy looking toe caps on those lace-ups.<eos> As they say, toe caps are the cobbler's best friend.<eos> - I did not know that. - Yeah.<eos> Yes. - The best. - Yeah.<eos> - You okay? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, no, I just... I'm just having trouble sleeping.<eos> - Yeah. I'll make your chamomile, then.<eos> Okay. You could try melatonin too.<eos> I know that four milligrams makes you a bit groggy, so I could break it up for you.
Yeah, no, it's just... it's, um... it's just work stuff, you know?<eos> Is that the job thing from today?<eos> Mm-hmm. It looks like there's a chance it could turn into something really exciting.<eos> But...<eos> I'm not sure if I want to take the risk.<eos> Well... You want to know what I think?<eos> Do it.<eos> Go for it.<eos> Jump in with both feet.<eos> Lucy, one of the things that I love about you is how brave you are.
- I'm so glad. - Hey... oh.<eos> I... Hey, hey, wait, I actually, um... I just came to give you this.<eos> It's your logo.<eos> I've got a couple different color options depending on whether you want to put it on a submarine or a land vessel.<eos> I take it you're not coming, then?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't you want a life of excitement?<eos> Adventure, wonder?<eos> Yeah, I really do. Um...<eos> Just not with you.
Ser-Seriously?<eos> - Like, us? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> We could... we could skip the pad thai and go search for buried treasure.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, why-why not?<eos> I mean, it's been a while since we went out.<eos> - Really?<eos> You're up for it?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Lucy, I'm up for anything, if it's with you.
- It was just like that. - Oh, my God.<eos> It was kind of too bad that all of our gold turned to sand at the end there, though.<eos> Yeah, yeah, indeed, but we learned a pretty cool lesson about greed.<eos> We did.<eos> That's true, we did.<eos> - Yeah. Will the shoes of tomorrow be bigger or smaller?<eos> Wider or narrower?<eos> Taller or shorter?<eos> You know what?<eos> I was thinking, what do you say every Saturday you and I get dressed up and go on a treasure hunt?
Because she's slippery.<eos> I was in East Anglia today and I went past the place where... .. where my unravelling started.<eos> That's hard to remember.<eos> Like it never happened.<eos> But it did, didn't it?<eos> He actually ate something today, which is good.<eos> How's work?<eos> Defending any more sex offenders or mad mullahs?<eos> We all have a right to a lawyer, Mum.<eos> Yes, but why does it always have to be you?

He doesn't know anything!<eos> How you like your fingers, Tico?<eos> You think you need all of them? Okay.<eos> - Okay, okay. - That's one, that's one.<eos> Please stop. Please stop.<eos> No, you didn't, Tico.<eos> Tell him you didn't do it.<eos> They're at my place, man.<eos> - They're at your place? - Yeah.<eos> Now, Tico, I just have one more question for you.
A cop?<eos> He's scared.<eos> What do you think he's gonna say?<eos> Think about it.<eos> It's the truth, man.<eos> I-I don't want to lie anymore.<eos> They booked me.<eos> He said that if I cooperated, then they would drop charges.<eos> Tico, it's okay.<eos> Now I just got one more question for you.
When Brandt and I were rookies, there was a burglary at Ryder Market.<eos> Meth head named Hank holed up inside with a shotgun.<eos> Shot clear through the rolling doors out front.<eos> The loading dock, it's the same kind of door.<eos> Brandt's telling us that we can't go through it.<eos> We need to find another way.<eos> The guy is being tortured.<eos> We start poking around, we're gonna get made.<eos> Gideon, we need another entry point.<eos> Way ahead of you.
It was a perilous journey.<eos> If you'll excuse me, Mr Read.<eos> Where are the brothers?<eos> They've gone upriver.<eos> Trade for corn with the Indians.<eos> Where's the sense in that?<eos> Which one are you? Hey, hey!<eos> You pick a woman who's grateful.<eos> Woman who's going to obey.<eos> Going to work for you.
There'll be plenty who want a wife.<eos> The taverner has paid your passage, they will know that.<eos> Well, I will take my chances.<eos> I'm not going back.<eos> Why should I? Because I need you.<eos> Do you think I don't want to run after what was done to me?<eos> Well, what if it's the same all across Virginia, Verity?<eos> What if these men have been on their own for so long, they're not men any more?<eos> The time will come when we have to stand and refuse and I know that, for me, that time is now.<eos> But I need you by my side if I'm to do it.

I'm not marrying a man who would gamble me away on the roll of a dice.<eos> Woman, when I drink beyond my senses, there ain't no logic left in me.<eos> Except one corner of the mind where cunning abides.<eos> But that little devil of thinking... it never deserts me.<eos> It's like a heavenly angel taking care of me.<eos> And that's why I gamble.<eos> Do you suppose I'm some kind of fool?<eos> I paid for your passage.<eos> I like the look of you.<eos> Do you think I'm going to let some old, lechering sailor get his hands on you?
There's times when the drink isn't your friend.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Wwatch... Look at this.<eos> I traded this when I first got here.<eos> I gave the Indians two barrels of ale for it.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> I've never touched gold before.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> It means, one day, this whole town is going to be mad with riches.<eos> You and me, Verity... we've got to be ready for it.
We weren't married, sir.<eos> A sorrow for you then.<eos> To be robbed of the man you were to marry.<eos> But I have work and shelter.<eos> Perhaps you'd be so kind as to allow me to call on you, Mistress Kett?<eos> I'm grateful for the consideration of your kind heart, Master Read, but I owe my loyalty to the Sharrows.<eos> A no wrapped in roses is still a no.<eos> Consequences?<eos> How dare he say such a thing on the street for the entire town to hear.<eos> If you make enemies of men of such power here, they will turn against you.
There will be the mark.<eos> Will you submit yourself to an examination of your body?<eos> What, take my clothes off for the likes of you?<eos> I'd rather swim back to England.<eos> It is not unknown for poison to be poured into a glove, for it to be smeared on the fingers and then swallowed when the victim eats.<eos> When the innkeeper's wife was put into the stocks, the marshal's glove was handed to him with the claim that he had dropped it.<eos> Secretary Farlow, to make such an accusation against the recorder's wife, even it is shown to be false, it could ruin him.<eos> If you should warn him, Dr Priestly, it will be considered an act of treason.<eos> Examine the gloves.<eos> I have a gift for you.

That was the ballad.<eos> I heard it on the street.<eos> It mesmerised me with glory.<eos> Before I knew any better, I'd joined up.<eos> I was a soldier, shipped out here.<eos> What kind of man is that?<eos> Throw his life away for the sake of a ballad?<eos> - A man who wants for bread. - Ah!<eos> And tell me, was it sung by a pretty lass, one you might wish to impress with your courage to take up arms?<eos> You don't need to fight to get a girl, Bailey, your sweet face will do that for you.

I can't get it.<eos> Why would you leave Silas behind?<eos> Nine year ago,<eos> Yeardley left the uplands beyond the falls without any gold.<eos> Now he's come back.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because he knows where to look.<eos> He has a map.<eos> That is why I must go now.<eos> If Silas had been with you, he might've saved you.
What will happen if you do not remove the stone?<eos> They sometimes pass.<eos> But I have known men taken by such fever and pain that they perish.<eos> So either way, I-I might...?<eos> I did not come here to take my last breath!<eos> I will give you my decision tomorrow, Dr Priestly.<eos> I've been looking at how this place goes on and on.<eos> Wonders as far my eyes can see.<eos> It's always restored me to see it, and to know what it means to build a new world.<eos> Me and you, Alice we'll have children.
He flew into a rage, sir.<eos> We were both so drunk.<eos> Fletcher said that she...<eos> Mistress Rutter, had fixed to meet with him, the same as me.<eos> Ain't I been a comfort to you?<eos> Go on, Bailey.<eos> She set one against the other, as far as I can see...<eos> Bailey, you were duped with drink into a black folly at the hands of the tavern keeper's wife.<eos> You are free to go.<eos> A dead bat would not shit on a man like you. Eh!
Bailey shot the man with a pistol.<eos> It's not your...<eos> Why would you destroy the tavern that gives you drink and song, man?<eos> Stop this... what do you think you are doing?<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Bailey? Bailey!<eos> Why are you doing this to us?<eos> We're here because you are the cause of Fletcher's death.<eos> No, Temperance.<eos> It is for you.
If it was my brother, that's what I'd do. No, no.<eos> No, Silas, you cannot go.<eos> Henry Sharrow is out there, alone.<eos> Don't you care to find out what has happened to him?<eos> Sorry.<eos> When have any of you men ever been concerned for the Sharrows?<eos> Why should you suddenly tell my husband what he must do?<eos> Now you leave us alone.<eos> All of you.<eos> What can they claim against you?
Is that what you believe?<eos> Nathan Bailey... something of a man, with a musket in his hand.<eos> Don't be about after darkness falls.<eos> You ain't nothing but a sweet, shy boy.<eos> I pass my hand across your head fondly as a sister might... your face flushes.<eos> Bailey, did you ever love a girl?<eos> 'Cause a lover's true kiss is worth living for.<eos> There's women coming here, Bailey.<eos> Plenty of them.<eos> Beautiful girls wanting kisses off handsome men like you.
It is a wound from that time that has stopped me from talking to you until now...<eos> So we are the same, are we not?<eos> I am one of you.<eos> I wore the uniform to serve God and country.<eos> And now, I am the Governor of the Colony of Virginia, knighted and trusted by our King, and I have this office because I showed obedience and loyalty.<eos> And you good men, every one of you.<eos> Jeffers,<eos> Dyer,<eos> Stubbs Bailey.<eos> I was like you, a boy soldier in a foreign land, no way to see how I might prosper.

That man is a traitor.<eos> He's the ring leader here.<eos> He tried to get close to you, Governor, so that he might kill you.<eos> It is true.<eos> Every one of you, it's over, get back to work.<eos> We will have order here.<eos> Oh, Bailey, you sweet boy.<eos> What have they done to you?<eos> Thank you, Marshall.<eos> I'll be a good wife to you, Samuel.
You are a good wife to me.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I'm selfish... and quarrelsome and over zealous for your position.<eos> Will you forgive me?<eos> There is nothing for me to forgive.<eos> We made it, Davie.<eos> Now is our time.<eos> We are rich men!<eos> If he ever comes close to you, you kill him.
- What are you babbling about?<eos> - Boys, ma'am.<eos> I meant to say boys leaping over bonfires.<eos> I'm just so excited. - The cheeses.<eos> - I see.<eos> St John's summer solstice Eve, ma'am.<eos> Is there anything more humdrum than hedge borne lads leaping over bonfires?<eos> Lady Yardley is making such plans and she's gathering volunteers.<eos> I shall dance a country dance until my legs fall off.<eos> I have a gift for you.
Do you hear me?<eos> No more thieving.<eos> I hear you.<eos> Verity, what if it's Henry comes down that river, not Silas?<eos> There's a thought to rob you of sleep.<eos> It's on me the whole day.<eos> I might lift my head and he's there.<eos> You need a weapon.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean, if he ever comes close to you, you kill him.
Governor.<eos> Why did you go searching for Henry Sharrow when his brother had reported him dead?<eos> I wanted to find out how he died.<eos> Did you ever speak of gold?<eos> - He did.<eos> - What's did he say?<eos> It wasn't me he spoke to.<eos> Meredith Rutter has a rock sometimes, two of them would sit and just look at it.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> We were in the same room as you.
Let me tell you what I know about that, there is no such a diagram.<eos> How do I know?<eos> Because if there was, how come it remained hidden all these years?<eos> The map is a fable, sir.<eos> There is nowt men like better than fables.<eos> Did you tell Yardley this?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Well, because he never asked about no map, sir.<eos> What is it that I don't like about you, Rutter, huh?
- We were told you went with him.<eos> - I did, yes.<eos> But I came back.<eos> We had a fight so I left him out there.<eos> Can you tell us which direction he took?<eos> He's headed high up into the mountains.<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I will come with you, Silas.
Do we have to come to Corny's?<eos> This place is for babies.<eos> Then you fit right in, Greggy.
One hour a week.<eos> I have failed as a parent.<eos> No.<eos> So who's excited about the Great Heffley Road Trip?<eos> A journey across the U.S. of A. to Meemaw's.<eos> Do we have to go?<eos> It's Meemaw's 90th birthday, and everyone's gonna be there.<eos> We're gonna see family we haven't seen in years.<eos> Oh, come on, Greg.<eos> I promise we're gonna make it fun for you.
Peepaw's father worked three jobs until he had enough money to buy his own land to grow soybeans.<eos> Why would anyone want to grow soybeans?<eos> Great story.<eos> Wake me up when it's over.<eos> Wow. Just wow.<eos> Were we this bored by our parents?<eos> If we agree to go to this country fair, can we get our phones back after?<eos> No.<eos> How about just for an hour?<eos> We do something for you and you do something for us.
But... you do get this here lollipop.<eos> Now, who's next?<eos> Lollipop.<eos> - Step on up here, folks. - Not now, Manny.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Who's next here?<eos> Hey there, little fella.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Can you see that pig right there?<eos> How much you think that pig weighs?
Wait, no!<eos> Hey! Why are you being such a spaz?<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm just really excited to, uh...<eos> To ride the "Alien Abduction."<eos> Let's rock.<eos> Stay against the wall and keep your hands to yourself! We're off.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have ate that 9th stick of butter.<eos> Ninth?<eos> You!
Ninth?<eos> You!<eos> Stop the ride!<eos> Stop the ride!<eos> It's a diaper, it's a diaper, it's a diaper!<eos> What the heck?<eos> Watch it, you jerk.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Stop it!<eos> You need to move, kid, or I will climb over you.
And Greg's a modern kid.<eos> Using his phone is in his DNA.<eos> What?<eos> Greg's been using his phone, too?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You made a deal with me.<eos> Will someone please pay for my van repairs?<eos> Stop!<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> You and Greg have been using your phones, and you both conspired to keep this from me?
Don't spill any.<eos> It's filling up.<eos> Then stop peeing.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> I've started, now I've got to see it through.<eos> He's right.<eos> Here.<eos> I don't want it!<eos> Oh, look how cute.<eos> The piggy's better potty trained than you, Greg.
Can you close the sunroof?<eos> Rodrick gummed it up, remember?<eos> Give it back!<eos> - You guys all right?<eos> - Thank you, we're fine! We're fine!<eos> This is pretty bad for you.<eos> You snuck to Player Expo, too.<eos> You're in as much trouble as I am.<eos> No way. I've spent years lowering Mom and Dad's expectations.<eos> They expect this kind of stuff from me, but not you.
At least, we thought the van was fixed.<eos> I'm not getting a signal.<eos> Look, there's a car!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello!<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Thank you so much for stopping.<eos> Oh, no, we don't speak Spanish.<eos> We still don't speak Spanish.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
But the one thing our road trip has taught me is that a little face time with my family really isn't that bad.<eos> And you know, we ended up with plenty of material for our own memory book.<eos> I don't think we're gonna be winning any Family of the Year awards.<eos> But our trip was definitely an adventure.<eos> Hey! In fact, I can't wait to see where we're going next year.<eos> Wherever it is, we're flying.<eos> Watch and learn, little bro. Watch and learn.<eos> Hey, ladies.<eos> My band's playing the car wash this weekend.<eos> Are you Diaper Hands?

I feel like it's given me massive purpose.<eos> I don't know what it is yet,<eos> I really don't, but that doesn't scare me.<eos> It's been nine months.<eos> Nine months since we left San Francisco and we rowed our little Doris under the Golden Gate Bridge, not really knowing what we were letting ourselves in for.<eos> I don't think I ever found it as my happy place again, but when I think back to being on the boat, I'm going to remember the waves and the skies and the stars and not the struggles.<eos> The moments that are gonna stay with me are all gonna be positive ones.<eos> [Tony] I'm going to drop the rope off, you pull it in.<eos> Part of history!<eos> Couldn't have done it without you!
You could have one of the uniformed guys do it.<eos> I hated the detectives who did that when I was in uniform.<eos> You're a good man, clive babineaux.<eos> - That better be tartar sauce. - Ew.<eos> What is it?<eos> Bloody shoes.<eos> The sole matches the pattern from the crime scene.<eos> Let's get you a barrel of wet wipes, and then we can go find our cinderella.<eos> Now, how about I go shower, and you have a little lunch?<eos> Almond milk chai latte for you, and the strong stuff for me.
It won't take a minute.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Right, the short version.<eos> I'm saying this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I haven't been a good friend.<eos> I've wanted to be, but...<eos> Look, intellectually... I know you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> We weren't together when you and Blaine had your...
I haven't been a good friend.<eos> I've wanted to be, but...<eos> Look, intellectually... I know you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> We weren't together when you and Blaine had your...<eos> You didn't know who he was.<eos> So it's my stupid macho problem.<eos> It's just...<eos> Any time my brain isn't otherwise occupied, these little movies begin playing in there, yeah?<eos> What kind of movies?<eos> Adult movies of Blaine and you doing stuff.
Lilywhite, along with "right in front of you," what's another place that bad guys might be?<eos> Right behind me, sir.<eos> That is correct. Now, what would be a good reminder?<eos> Five miles, white team.<eos> Do it!<eos> Know what all those guys did before they were zombie mercenaries?<eos> I don't know, Justin. Play villains in '80s movies?<eos> They were human mercenaries, and before that, they were army.<eos> The only thing that's changed for them are the rations.<eos> You and me?

I killed people for money.<eos> - That's not what I...<eos> - I tortured you.<eos> - I literally killed you.<eos> - Ravi, enough!<eos> - Open your eyes, Peyton!<eos> - My eyes are wide open.<eos> Why are you being such a dick?<eos> It isn't obvious?<eos> It's because I'm in love with you.
Now run out and grab me an Espresso while I tackle decor.<eos> Why can't the big guy do it?<eos> Dino suffers from small-fiber neuropathy.<eos> His feet hurt.<eos> Ice-blended.<eos> - Hey. - You love me?<eos> I do.<eos> Then why have you been so awful to me?<eos> Why haven't you been there for me?<eos> I was held at gunpoint, ravi. I thought I was going to die, and yet somehow you've made this about you, about your pride, about your jealousy.
And I'm... I'm so sorry.<eos> Pride.<eos> I'm done with it.<eos> Look, it's only been a liability.<eos> I was so excited that we were back together.<eos> So was I.<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> A little.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> The one thing that's stopping this from happening is you.
Looks like the spam escaped your socks.<eos> Wait, you can make that kinda money from home?<eos> So I'm asking you to poke your head in.<eos> See who's takin' charge.<eos> It's just a meeting.<eos> I'm sure it'll be civilized.<eos> Well, that does not seem very PC.<eos> Or is it allowed if you're darker than a Band-Aid?<eos> I'm not ready to be around people yet.<eos> And maybe that includes you.
Or is it allowed if you're darker than a Band-Aid?<eos> I'm not ready to be around people yet.<eos> And maybe that includes you.<eos> You should go.<eos> I'm not in uniform.<eos> And you're nice and anonymous. Anonymous?<eos> There are, like, four Asian girls in this prison and my girlfriend just died.<eos> Oh, so let them comfort you, then.<eos> Well, I can't go out there.<eos> When there's a revolution, who do you think it is that gets guillotined first?
I mean, imagine the big one with Sankey's hair.<eos> So you glue her scalp onto her head, you got a Pamela fucking Anderson.<eos> Pamela who?<eos> What, really?<eos> Who did you wank to, growing up?<eos> We, uh, weren't allowed.<eos> Yeah, no one's allowed, man.<eos> Hey, you suck.<eos> You and your stupid blue shirt.<eos> She's talking about you.
- Huh?<eos> Yeah? - Shut up!<eos> I have come!<eos> It's not gonna get better than this, boys.<eos> All right, moment of truth.<eos> Fuck Helen, marry Sankey, and then you kill Brandy.<eos> Nah, I gotta say...<eos> Fuck Sankey, marry Helen, kill Brandy.<eos> Man, I am not made of stone.<eos> You and me, blondie.
Come on!<eos> Open the door, Flores.<eos> I prefer not.<eos> How'd you like ten more years in prison?<eos> I don't mind it so much now that we running the place.<eos> Go to the chapel.<eos> Tell Maria the Jolly Gay Giant is back.<eos> When I get in there, I'm going to personally take you apart, Piscatella style.<eos> If you can find me.<eos> I know we all look alike to you.
We could take down that walking tree.<eos> Great, so more of us can end up like the little black hooch maker?<eos> How does Ruiz always end up in charge?<eos> We gotta look into that.<eos> You think you can do better?<eos> I can't answer that right now.<eos> I gotta think about it.<eos> Just shoot Piscatella.<eos> - We got the gun, don't we? - Yeah.<eos> Oh, so you're in charge now?
That's not bad.<eos> We could be, like, plastic surgeons.<eos> It's not Demi Moore good, but at least it's, like, Meg Ryan good.<eos> - Yeah, so we ready?<eos> - Maybe a little eyeliner?<eos> You know, to wake his eyes up.<eos> Yo, stop fucking around.<eos> Get him on stage.<eos> This ain't over.<eos> When we're done with you, your outside's gonna match your insides.
You know, I told that whole room, "Hey, guess who fixed the power?"<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's a tough fucking crowd.<eos> Got any family out there?<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> So... it took me one whole minute to look this cute.<eos> It only took me 30 seconds to get so pretty for you.<eos> Rude. What?<eos> I'm two years younger than you.
Oh, shit!<eos> Thanks for the help, guys.<eos> Really appreciate it.<eos> Some of us are smart enough not to go near a unmarked box.<eos> I mean, that could be anything.<eos> It could be a bomb.<eos> Anthrax.<eos> Itty-bitty soldiers.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> One for you...
Out here, we're trying to relax and shit.<eos> Like you're really relaxing in the middle of all this after what went down?<eos> It's more like I'm just tryin' not to make shit worse.<eos> Yeah, I hear that.<eos> You seriously trying to sit out now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think so.<eos> You know, I'm trying to get back home to my baby girl one day, and this might be the only way to avoid all the fucked up shit that keeps finding me.<eos> It's like... It's like I'm a fucked-up-shit magnet.<eos> It ain't you.
To laying low.<eos> To Drake's fine ass.<eos> - I'll drink to that. - Mmm.<eos> Look at Neri!<eos> She's showing.<eos> - You're texting with Cal?<eos> - What else am I gonna do?<eos> It's not like I'm busy with any important riot duties.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sitting this out must be so hard for you.
Whatever you say, my great leader.<eos> I am only here to serve you, my great leader.<eos> Well, that's kinda hot.<eos> What can I tell you?<eos> Yeah, you can keep crying about Hugo... or you can make another decision.<eos> It's hard to lose a pet, eh.<eos> Especially when he gets blown up by your ex-husband during a botched attempt to murder your neighbor.<eos> I mean, it's a tale as old as time.<eos> Someone, who was definitely not my meditation instructor at rehab number seven in Sedona, once told me that depression is holding on... and sadness is, uh...<eos> I think it's time for you to let go of Hugo.
Tasha...<eos> It's Taystee now.<eos> I was 15.<eos> I didn't have nothing.<eos> No place to live.<eos> No parents.<eos> Just a boyfriend and a tiny room in his nasty aunt's apartment, then...<eos> Then I got pregnant.<eos> She told us she'd kick us both out if we kept it...<eos> You.
There's got to be a better way.<eos> Holy fuck, am I gonna be famous.<eos> Okay, this shit is fucking bananas.<eos> Aleida?<eos> Hi. April.<eos> We spoke on the phone.<eos> Let's get you inside.<eos> And we'll get you into makeup.<eos> You hear that shit? "Get you into makeup."<eos> Hey, Ape, let me ask you a question.
So, it's like, uh, do we try to do the work ourselves?<eos> - You know, I bought a book.<eos> - You're not an electrician.<eos> Okay, I could try.<eos> And what happens when the whole house goes up in flames, we're left with nothing, or, God forbid, you get a shock and cook yourself from the inside out... Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> You're gonna stress out the muffin.<eos> - You're right.<eos> - Babe...<eos> So, what you been up to, man?
Holy shit.<eos> Nancy Drew done uncovered a suspect.<eos> - Let's search 'em.<eos> - Now, hold on a second.<eos> You don't have the right to go through our things like that.<eos> But...<eos> - Gotcha.<eos> - So much for respecting your elders!<eos> - You gonna miss me? - Nah.<eos> You just jealous 'cause I got a family and you don't.
Why can't I come?<eos> It's just not a good time for us.<eos> Us.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Uh, look.<eos> I want you to take this.<eos> It's not much, but I want to help you.<eos> Did you tell them... about me?<eos> Guess this is you doin' right, huh?<eos> What's right for you!
This is not funny.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I know you're serious.<eos> I know, baby.<eos> And that is the problem.<eos> Because you are also bat-shit crazy.<eos> I didn't mean to lead you on, honey.<eos> It's the hormones.<eos> The hormones, they made me do it with you.
I guess this is how it ends.<eos> Well, this is your chance to retire from all that nonsense out there.<eos> Ain't you tired of dealing with numbskulls?<eos> Fighting for food?<eos> Trying to find a minute of quiet without someone squawking in your ear?<eos> Don't you feel taken for granted?<eos> I got enough supplies down here for all of us.<eos> It's, maybe, a little cramped?<eos> "Thank you, Frieda."<eos> "Gee, this is awful nice of you, Frieda."
Look at them.<eos> They're like beached whales, but more sad.<eos> Well, no one's forcing them to be out here.<eos> Yeah, but we need them out here, you know?<eos> If we ever want this shit to end, we gotta have more bitches out here than there is in there.<eos> Last I checked, you were leading the Guards Gone Wild cavity search.<eos> I'm a changed woman.<eos> More like bipolar.<eos> Look, I got my reasons.<eos> Point is... I want this thing over, just like you.
Get your crayons.<eos> I've always been more of a girth gal, myself.<eos> Don't like them long jobbies that poke your cervix.<eos> Amen to that.<eos> Ain't nothin' like a Fat Albert.<eos> Those fatties stretch you out.<eos> I like to stay tight.<eos> Ain't yoga good for that?<eos> No, but it does make the dirty wheelbarrow position a lot easier.<eos> How 'bout you, Norma?
Ain't yoga good for that?<eos> No, but it does make the dirty wheelbarrow position a lot easier.<eos> How 'bout you, Norma?<eos> What's the dirtiest thing you've ever done?<eos> Let me see. Let me see.<eos> Damn!<eos> I didn't know you ladies got down like that.<eos> They didn't call it the sexual revolution for nothin'.<eos> Come on, squirt.<eos> What you got?
You told me to blend.<eos> I'm blending.<eos> Fucking the prison's lead stud isn't what I meant.<eos> Well, we're not fucking.<eos> We've agreed to take things slow.<eos> And what about your other beau?<eos> The one who's in the guard bubble, probably being sodomized right about now?<eos> Listen, I told your blonde friend that Joe and I are over.<eos> You don't think they're really doing sodomy, do you?<eos> What do you care? You've got your new crush to worry about.
Is this one bothering' you?<eos> No. No, no. She's, uh, trying to trade something for deodorant.<eos> Gum?<eos> Look what I have.<eos> Come on.<eos> There you go.<eos> Take a cold shower, Vause. She's with me.<eos> - Shall we, Amelia?<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> Who the hell are you?
I'm not an idiot.<eos> What about "tits" spelled with numbers?<eos> That, too.<eos> - Oh! Jeffrey Dahmer's birthday.<eos> - I've tried everything!<eos> It's useless!<eos> All that hard work was for nichevo!<eos> I'm a failure!<eos> I failed my girls!<eos> I failed you!
My husband put his mozzarella all over my baked ziti, and he told me that he loved me.<eos> Isn't that romantic?<eos> Lorna la Loca!<eos> Hey, blondie.<eos> Does the, uh, carpet match the drapes?<eos> Hey, uh, let me test the echo in your love cave.<eos> I promise, you'll only like it a lot.<eos> Nichols!<eos> Oh, what's the matter?<eos> I'm not white enough for you?
- Yeah.<eos> Shit will make your eyes pop.<eos> Whoa, now back the fuck off.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, look like butchy want to play.<eos> Ooh. Anybody ever tell you size matters?<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Yeah, fuck off.<eos> That's right.<eos> And it's Mr. Butch to you!
And no flash photography.<eos> Just be respectful.<eos> So simple.<eos> Maybe I should learn how to read.<eos> You brought her favorite.<eos> Listen, I'm sorry about last night.<eos> I was drunk and insensitive and rude, and you did not deserve that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I know how much she meant to you.
You brought her favorite.<eos> Listen, I'm sorry about last night.<eos> I was drunk and insensitive and rude, and you did not deserve that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I know how much she meant to you.<eos> And how much you meant to her.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm pissed off, just like you.
Must be nice, having an outlet for all your shit.<eos> - So much shit.<eos> - So much shit. Hmm.<eos> God, who knew having a conscience would be such a bummer?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Do you ever have it where, like... 'cause of the guilt, you just feel sick all the time?<eos> Like, nauseous almost?<eos> I got a lot of emotions about what happened, but guilt ain't one of them.<eos> - Really? - Mmm-hmm. Even the whole bullet in the guard situation?<eos> You know what? I'm sick of you and everyone putting that shit on me.
That gun may have landed in front of you, but it was your finger that pulled that damn trigger. You did that.<eos> You did that!<eos> Look...<eos> And I know that sometimes our only choices are between shitty and shittier, but whatever we end up doing, we gotta own it.<eos> Somehow find grace in it.<eos> Come on.<eos> The bodega was out of the wing ones, so I got you the extra-long.<eos> That guy that works there, what's his name?<eos> - Paolo?<eos> - He asked about you.
Somehow find grace in it.<eos> Come on.<eos> The bodega was out of the wing ones, so I got you the extra-long.<eos> That guy that works there, what's his name?<eos> - Paolo?<eos> - He asked about you.<eos> That's not embarrassing at all.<eos> - Why? You like him or something?<eos> - No.<eos> 'Cause I think he got a little crush on you.
No.<eos> Just get me the fuck out of here!<eos> My nose!<eos> - Go.<eos> - Go.<eos> Piss elsewhere.<eos> Move.<eos> Get me... - the fuck out of here! - Hmm.<eos> Back the fuck away.<eos> You back away, you hall-pissing, guard-loving, finger-shooting hillbilly.
Okay. Can you relax please?<eos> I'll get him to back off.<eos> I'm kind of good at this shit.<eos> Open the fucking door or I'm gonna dig into those flat little tits of yours and get the key myself!<eos> Okay. For your information, these titties are fuller than they've ever been.<eos> Although they are very painful.<eos> And you are a pain in my ass.<eos> Why don't you just get the fuck out of here?<eos> Okay.<eos> No, not you!
Suicide Sunday.<eos> Not real Sunday.<eos> That's when you've been high for too long.<eos> Friday, Saturday, life's just a, uh, rush of possibility, you know?<eos> Maybe you even feel like you're not such a worthless piece of shit for a minute.<eos> And then Sunday comes along.<eos> And your heart is like a jackhammer on your brain and you realize that none of it was real.<eos> And you want to claw your eyes out.<eos> This is just, uh, part of the ride.<eos> Is this what it's like for you, Nicky?
- Neither are we.<eos> - Alex.<eos> - What's going on, Pipes?<eos> Pulling the lever.<eos> Diaz needs to turn herself in. Or riot amnesty is off the table for everyone.<eos> We're sacrificing the one for the many.<eos> And what's the difference between her and me?<eos> Hey.<eos> You shot a motherfucking guard and you gonna "hey" me?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
That's good.<eos> How is that good?<eos> Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna tell them he brought the gun in before and put that shit in your mouth and threatened to blow your head off because he's a fucking psycho.<eos> Nobody's gonna believe that.<eos> It's your word against a Brussels sprout.<eos> - Brussels sprout?<eos> - Pick another vegetable!<eos> Whatever!<eos> The point is, he's dead in the head and can't defend himself.<eos> But you still can.
- Brussels sprout?<eos> - Pick another vegetable!<eos> Whatever!<eos> The point is, he's dead in the head and can't defend himself.<eos> But you still can.<eos> Just please, stop already.<eos> You got to stop being a manatee, Daya.<eos> Just floating around, watching the world go by you with your big eyes, waiting for the boat to ram its propeller into your head!<eos> You got to be the shark.<eos> No, you're the shark, Ma.
We could zip-tie him to the bed and do a mustache rodeo.<eos> Or prop his dick up with some popsicle sticks and duct tape.<eos> Okay, um... so according to my Italian, they're either going to ride my horse or eat ice cream on me.<eos> I'm wagering that you're the ice cream in this scenario.<eos> What if we put something up his ass?<eos> You know if you tickle his prostate right, you get a rise out of him.<eos> - Mmm. - Or we make him watch porn.<eos> What kind of porn you like?<eos> What?<eos> Doesn't look good for you, man.
Come on.<eos> Here, have a little drink.<eos> Now, you should probably expect some, uh, primo headaches, a little bit of short-term memory loss, even a soupçon of hellish hallucinations.<eos> Let's try and sleep through some of that?<eos> Oh, I feel like my hot flashes are having hot flashes.<eos> That, too.<eos> Okay. I'm gonna make you a cold compress, because I am all in on this whole role-reversal thing we got going here, okay?<eos> Every parent becomes the child sooner or later.<eos> But I didn't think it would happen so soon.<eos> It was for you, Nicky, and for my girls.
I mean, the whole prison insomnia jamboree, yeah, but this schmuck is just another instrument in the band.<eos> But we love that you were thinking of us.<eos> I'm gonna grab the ice. I'll be right back.<eos> No, no, don't leave me. Don't leave me alone!<eos> I'm not. Uh, nobody's ever really alone, Red.<eos> We got a lifetime of regrets to keep us company.<eos> - How was your day?<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> I discovered a whole new muscle in my back I hadn't pulled yet.<eos> You?
We got a lifetime of regrets to keep us company.<eos> - How was your day?<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> I discovered a whole new muscle in my back I hadn't pulled yet.<eos> You?<eos> Well, I soldered six more spindles than yesterday.<eos> -Oh... Ah. -So much job satisfaction.<eos> -Punching out early again, Galina?<eos> -One minute early.<eos> There should be some perks to dating you, no?
The point is our education program ain't never been no education program, even before it was put on hold for some alleged murder.<eos> Manual labor without instruction ain't an education, and it damn sure ain't no life skills.<eos> You think she'd be sayin' "ain't" so much if we had an education program?<eos> I'd like to believe you.<eos> Really, I would.<eos> But, in light of these ongoing revelations, the injured guard you refuse to hand over, it's tough.<eos> You lost credibility.<eos> Give me a second.<eos> Come on, Watson.<eos> You talk too fucking much!
All right.<eos> I'mma go pee.<eos> Bam! Irkutsk is mine.<eos> The fuck is Irkutsk, anyway?<eos> All right, excuse me.<eos> Coming through.<eos> Tryin' to live my best self, here.<eos> Nichols.<eos> Nichols.<eos> Is that you, hot girl?
-We dance.<eos> -It's too slow for the Barynya.<eos> You make it up, dummy.<eos> The Westerners use their hips, like Elvis Presley.<eos> You're supposed to look like you're having sex without touching.<eos> Like this?<eos> You look like you hurt yourself.<eos> -That guy is staring at us.<eos> -Not at us.<eos> At you.
-What?<eos> Yo, this bitch lied to me twice!<eos> Aleida, calm down.<eos> I'm staring at my daughter in handcuffs right now!<eos> I ask you to look out for her and the next thing I know she's shooting somebody and confesses?<eos> Her life is over!<eos> You've been fucking up her life for 23 years, querida.<eos> You think that I was gonna undo that in a week?<eos> All you had to do was be an equally bad mother, not a hundred fuckin' thousand times worse.<eos> Fool me once, shame on you.

I'll fuckin' cut your tit off.<eos> Yeah, you know what? I would love to stay here and get yelled at, but I got my own kids to worry about.<eos> Well, I'll be prayin' for them little bastards, 'cause they don't stand a chance with you as their mother.
- You did not come up.<eos> Ain't all about you, Mr. C.<eos> Oh, but we did get you a little gift.<eos> We, uh, got it from the guard bathroom.<eos> Piney fresh.<eos> Now that you piney fresh, you can bring your ass.<eos> Where'd everybody go?<eos> Shouldn't we go where it's more populated?<eos> Is this the teen-scream scenario? Hmm?<eos> Me in the letterman jacket, you with the pom-poms.
What'd we do before, like, two days ago?<eos> -I guess we used to talk to people.<eos> -Crazy.<eos> Maybe we should just split up and search separately.<eos> Hell, no, Scooby-Doo.<eos> It's creepy as fuck in here!<eos> Plus, we do everything together.<eos> Yeah, you're right, I don't know why I said that.<eos> You were having, like, a Snickers moment.<eos> You ain't you when you're hungry.
If your mom could talk outta her Ritz cracker, I think she'd say she's proud of you.<eos> -Maybe.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -You got room for one more?<eos> -Who's gonna cook?<eos> Ain't like there's food left.<eos> Right?<eos> It's nice to see you finally gettin' in the spirit.<eos> See? I told you she wasn't just a bossy twatwaffle.<eos> Is that you, Vause?

I told you she wasn't just a bossy twatwaffle.<eos> Is that you, Vause?<eos> I thought that you hated shower sex.<eos> I'm giving this one last shot.<eos> For you.
You wanna know what I think, Suzanne?<eos> I think crazy is just a word people invented to keep the extra-interesting people down.<eos> Well, Mommy says there are many shades of different as there are of people.<eos> Well, I wish I was told that when I was growing up.<eos> Are those my meds?<eos> You don't need these anymore, Suzanne.<eos> No, actually... I do.<eos> They're just trying to sand down your edges, make you all the same shade.<eos> I'm not good with metaphors, but I do know one thing.<eos> You should be free to be you.
Not just to Israel now... but to America.<eos> You're not Jewish.<eos> You pay them... to find your Jewish relatives.<eos> -And how does that help me?<eos> -If we were married...<eos> So that's your plan.<eos> Listen.<eos> We don't have to be together in that way.<eos> It can all be for show.<eos> I know you think... I'm not man enough for you.
Or Jason's mom, technically.<eos> Spoiler alert.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Let's just say it's a good thing I do yoga.<eos> Wait, I never do that shit.<eos> -Yoga. Where is she?<eos> -I don't know. -And Gina and Norma?<eos> Shit!<eos> -I don't know!<eos> Oh, what? I mean, this isn't enough, uh, distressed damsels for you?
She'd be inky.<eos> Or maybe she's just such a good forger, she went ahead and forged herself.<eos> What?<eos> How's she so fast?<eos> Adrenaline and lies.<eos> Yeah, you fully hiding, ain't you?<eos> Fuckin' thermometer planet.<eos> Come on!<eos> One more round.<eos> I ain't playing with you no more.
It's an ancient Greek or Roman covered portico.<eos> -Sounds foreign to me.<eos> -It's an architectural term.<eos> Fine.<eos> Forgive me for trying.<eos> I'm getting a migraine.<eos> I'm too baked to focus.<eos> Well, lucky you.<eos> Better bored down here than up there in The Purge.<eos> So you say.
You've captured six women in a closet.<eos> Such a big strong man.<eos> But what about all those other little chickens out there, huh?<eos> Ready to pluck your feathers and rip off your balls?<eos> There are 20 women guarding the hostages.<eos> Three hundred more are strolling around the hallways, hungry and bored, looking for some action.<eos> What exactly were you thinking you'd do?<eos> You think I'm here to rescue the hostages?<eos> I've taught my guards to fend for themselves.<eos> I'm here for you, Reznikov.
No more touching what ain't yours to touch.<eos> Bunch of careless stoners!<eos> You are guests in my home!<eos> Don't make me trigger the booby traps.<eos> You're pathetic.<eos> You know that?<eos> What happened to you that you're like this, Piscatella? Huh?<eos> What? Were you, uh, a pet-killing scourge of the cul-de-sac?<eos> Or was it more of a Drama of the Gifted Child situation?<eos> Huh? Did Papa Piscatella rage on you for being "Little Desi the queer"?
Something wrong?<eos> You seem down.<eos> It's stupid.<eos> Nothing that matters to you is stupid.<eos> All right, it's not a big deal.<eos> Rosado and his merry band of bitches swiped my radio yesterday.<eos> I'll kill them.<eos> No, seriously, should I kill them?<eos> -No. Come on.<eos> -I'll kill them. I will kill them for you.

I will kill them for you.<eos> I brought you something. -What?
There is only so much taxpayer money available.<eos> You want to tell the kids at PS whatever that their music program's been canceled because a bunch of inmates need to cage their rage with arts and crafts?<eos> This is not about resource allocation, it's about priorities.<eos> Is the goal to rehabilitate these women, or line the pockets of MCC's shareholders?<eos> Who gives a shit about MCC?<eos> You are arguing with the wrong bogeyman.<eos> I represent the governor, and his priority is that we end this ASAP.<eos> Well, it's my priority to make sure we do right by these women.<eos> And why do you think I'm here, Joe?<eos> To have a threesome with you and that lunatic who ran in here before?
We ain't never gonna get to Bayley with this shit.<eos> Not a single new demand has even been agreed on since they started scrapping'.<eos> Man, I keep tellin' you, T, white people mess up everything. Twerking, cornrows, Africa... the White House.<eos> She got a point.<eos> Face it, Joe.<eos> You fucked this up.<eos> And I don't think it's the first time you've heard that, is it?<eos> It's kind of like you have the reverse Midas touch.<eos> Everything you put your hands on turns to shit.<eos> Now, what's that make you, sweetheart?
Well, of course, it was a suicide mission.<eos> All of the inmates ended up dead, either by killing themselves, in the ensuing gunfire, or later, through the death penalty.<eos> I suppose that's the big takeaway from this, that the inmates guarding the hostages almost never survive.<eos> Tough stuff.<eos> Up next, is that a poochie in your Gucci?<eos> What did you think would happen, Red?<eos> You'd get out of here someday?<eos> Pick up where you left off with your little mafia friends?<eos> Be honest.<eos> Is there anything even out there for you?
Kiss my fucking ass, bitch!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> This is what you do to get off, Tweety Bird?<eos> By watching me sweat?<eos> Fucker! Fucker! Fucker!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> No! I think that's probably enough.<eos> Come on, Desi.<eos> We take 'em out when they start screaming.<eos> I don't hear anything, do you?
- Shut the fuck...<eos> - Lying is very bad.<eos> - Dying is very, very bad. - Oh.<eos> Suzanne.<eos> Suzanne, I'm gonna need you to calm down, all right?<eos> You're a liar, liar, pants on fire!<eos> You've all been fed a bunch of lies.<eos> I mean, they wanna put labels on you, like crazy, psycho, deranged stalker.<eos> But we're not gonna let them do that, are we?<eos> Because there is nothing wrong with you.
That, and a little bit of lipstick, that is all the medicine you need!<eos> Go on, get out of here. Go on!<eos> What if your self still has a headache, even after you tell it, "You're great"?<eos> Well, I hadn't, uh, considered that particular situation.<eos> This is more of an anti-depressant, anti-psychotic kinda theory.<eos> - So can I have an Advil or something?<eos> - Well, I can't see why not.<eos> As long as it doesn't affect your self-esteem.<eos> You know, I gotta say, you seem real nice.<eos> Aw, well, thank you.
- Oh, I got this.<eos> - This ain't doin' shit!<eos> You didn't learn your lesson from your friend earlier?<eos> What lesson?<eos> There ain't no lesson here!<eos> Just a bunch of sociopaths torturing us, and for what?<eos> You think getting better food is gonna make you not a criminal?<eos> The world already considers y'all a pile of garbage, and that was before you went and held a bunch of innocent people hostage.<eos> You think people will be on your side now?<eos> You, with the boobs.

I'm good at it.<eos> I'm getting somewhere.<eos> So you tell me what's more important... one girl who can't handle not getting her breakfast on time or the rest of us who is in here tryin' to survive every day?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Live on the scene here at Litchfield Prison.<eos> No new activity in the last few hours. We are still awaiting any...<eos> - Hey, I was watching that!<eos> - And I was turning it off.<eos> You better get your booty to the bus stop.<eos> If the bus leaves without you, you got a long walk.
No. No, no, no!<eos> No.<eos> That is the problem around here.<eos> You are the problem.<eos> Okay, she is not sick.<eos> She is wonderful and beautiful and unique and just because her brain doesn't think like everybody else's around here, doesn't mean we should stuff her full of pills.<eos> - Do you know why we do that to people? - Hmm?<eos> So we can feel more comfortable, so we don't have to deal with anyone who isn't what we think they should be.<eos> I mean, who... who's to say what normal is, anyway?<eos> Look, Professor Fakey Pants, I don't know what normal is, but I know it ain't you.
Utica?<eos> I thought you were from Connecticut.<eos> You know, it is a little known fact about Connecticut - that we actually also have a Utica. - Mmm.<eos> Yeah, it's near New Haven.<eos> Well, now, aren't you just a little bundle of Connecticut trivia?<eos> I kill at trivia night.<eos> In Connecticut.<eos> Specifically in Connecticut.<eos> Fuck, would you look at me?<eos> I'm all giggly and gay for you.
She been sending them shitheads to the Poo all day.<eos> It's been mad entertaining.<eos> Yeah, she's like Scarface or some shit.<eos> Nah, she's like that dude in the karate movie, the one with the kid!<eos> What's it called?<eos> - Karate Kid.<eos> - Right.<eos> 'Cause we like the old dude who's been teaching her.<eos> Hey, why do you guys care about this thing?<eos> The real question is, why don't you?
- Then no.<eos> You can't stop me from taking him down.<eos> Maybe instead of continuing to obsess over this whole revenge thing, you could, I don't know, uh, look around at the consequences of your drug-fueled actions and apologize.<eos> For what?<eos> So we're still in the denial phase.<eos> Noted.<eos> This is sort of all your fault, Red.<eos> Oh, don't be ridiculous.<eos> Nothing is ever one person's fault.<eos> You and your heavy-browed minion over there lured him in here.
If you want to talk to him first, I thought... maybe he can hear you.<eos> - You'll hold the phone to him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Baby?<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> I know you don't like it when I call you that, but you're still my baby.<eos> And everything's gonna be okay, you hear me?<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> The doctors, they're gonna take care of you, and I'mma be there real soon.

Dr. Chapman is here.<eos> And I am gonna scrounge together the finest cocktail that Litchfield has to offer.<eos> I already got some Tylenol from Arsenic and Old Lace over there.<eos> It probably expired in '98.<eos> Expiration dates are a marketing scheme.<eos> Totally bogus.<eos> All right. I'm gonna go to the pharmacy.<eos> I'll see if I can get you something harder.<eos> Wait, you're actually considering going back out there?<eos> - For you.
- What happened to you?<eos> I got mauled by a bear.<eos> - You take some of Red's vitamins?<eos> - Oh, I wish.<eos> Any drugs of any kind would have really helped with the tsunami of fucked-up that was last night.<eos> But, sadly... still sober.<eos> You gonna tell me what happened, or you... you gonna keep stalling with all your words?<eos> Uh, for now, I don't want to talk about it.<eos> You know, I don't wanna think about it.<eos> All I want to do is just sit here, you know, with you.
Babe... you're actually pregnant.<eos> I mean, you're also crazy, but, uh, unless you put these in someone else's piss...<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> - Well... okay, you're with child here.<eos> No, that's not... that's not... possible, because you said...<eos> I didn't believe you.<eos> All right, maybe I was scared, you know, imagining a hairy little bambino popping out of your vajayjay.<eos> It's not exactly the stuff of masturbatory fantasies.<eos> But, uh...<eos> Hey, I'm happy for you.
You mean Figueroa gave in on everything else on the list?<eos> Look, none of that matters if we don't get what we came for.<eos> A lot of us care about those other things.<eos> - Yeah. - Oh, so now y'all wanna give a shit?<eos> Yo, y'all need to chill.<eos> If T say they're coming back, they're coming back.<eos> But how much longer can we afford to wait?<eos> What about Suzanne?<eos> Wait, I told Cindy to deal with her ass already.<eos> Oh, you the one that sent "Shalom, y'all" to give Suzanne lithium?
But then Taystee had to pull her dick out, and now...<eos> It's just a matter of time before they come back with everything.<eos> Keep telling yourself that.<eos> - So we're not getting the demands?<eos> - It's a wait-and-see.<eos> Shut Litchfield down!<eos> Shut Litchfield down!<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Mom!<eos> Piper, honey, is that you?
- Oh... Are you?<eos> No!<eos> God, no.<eos> She's got, like, four kids.<eos> And no tits.<eos> I mean, I keep telling Lorna this.<eos> She don't listen to me.<eos> Just keep telling her until she does.<eos> You know... all her life, all she has ever wanted is for somebody to reassure her that she is worthy of love.<eos> So if you do that, then, um... you know, she will be good to you, she will take care of you.

Obviously not in the winter.<eos> Taos, maybe.<eos> Last boarding call for express bus to Albany and Poughkeepsie.<eos> Last boarding call for Albany and Poughkeepsie, Bus 419.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> Have a safe trip.<eos> This is the final boarding call for the 3:35 to Albany, Utica and Litchfield, departing immediately from gate 14.<eos> You don't handle her like this!<eos> Well, maybe what I've done for Suzanne ain't what you would've done, but I tried.
Okay.<eos> I need you to listen to me for a second.<eos> I think that this thing might be over and I'm gonna be able to get you some real help soon, but first... I want you to have this.<eos> - Beans.<eos> - A can of beans?<eos> Just pretend it's corn.<eos> It's a very long story.<eos> You have taught me... that... love hurts.<eos> You've taught me that life... It hurts.<eos> And I want to be there for you.
Fine.<eos> Then let's not.<eos> I didn't have a choice, ok?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go to Arkadia.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm a better thief than I am a hunter.<eos> - I'll come with you.
You tell yourself that if you need to, but the radiation isn't killing that child.<eos> You are.<eos> You're looking for these?<eos> Where did you g... never mind.<eos> I didn't know how many you needed, so I took it all.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Go.<eos> Give it to the child first, and if it works, you give it to the others.<eos> I'm glad you're back, John.<eos> I was worried about you.
My daughter was meant to lead our people.<eos> Looks like you found that daughter now.<eos> Roan sent me here to kill you.<eos> If I don't come back with the Flame, he will send others.<eos> If the spirit of the Commanders deems it my time, then so be it.<eos> Indra, tell me what you want me to do here.<eos> Without the Flame, the king is vulnerable.<eos> We will need to fight to keep him on the throne.<eos> If that's what you want me to do,<eos> I'll do it for you.
No insects.<eos> What?<eos> Luna said the fish were dying.<eos> What are the things that eat the fish and bugs gonna eat now?<eos> What happened to us deserving a lucky break?<eos> So what are we looking for?<eos> The bunker would have been at the lowest point.<eos> Anything structural.<eos> She's lucky to have you.<eos> Leadership is a lonely pursuit, but you... you keep her centered.
But what if there was another way?<eos> I don't think anybody, if they're honest with themselves, can say they truly trust President Underwood.<eos> - Why should they?<eos> You know what?<eos> What?<eos> -I wanna be that person.<eos> -What person?<eos> The person that does this for, like, an hour and then leaves.<eos> That's not what this--<eos> Doug, I've been having sex for as long as you have.
What?<eos> -I wanna be that person.<eos> -What person?<eos> The person that does this for, like, an hour and then leaves.<eos> That's not what this--<eos> Doug, I've been having sex for as long as you have.<eos> And when you called me, that's what it sounded like.<eos> And I thought, "Great." But I'm here now.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I should take you home.

And if we all work together the way they have, then I promise, we will truly make this the first of many, many new days for the greatest country in the world.<eos> Good morning, America.<eos> God bless America, and thank you.<eos> And we're out.<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> You did great.<eos> -You did it. -Yeah.<eos> Everyone is so pleased.<eos> I know it was tough, but you got through it.<eos> -I'm really proud of you.
Oh, no. Come on, it's tradition.<eos> If Doug needs us, he'll call.<eos> Yes, but it's different this time.<eos> There's so much going on-- -I know, but call me superstitious.<eos> -We're in here. But we have done this every election we have ever won.<eos> -Come on. -I wonder if I know what you mean.<eos> I wonder if you wonder.<eos> It was a hot afternoon, and I still remember the smell of honeysuckle all down that street.<eos> How could I have known that murder... Can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?<eos> Maybe you would've known, Keyes, the minute she mentioned accident insurance.

Can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?<eos> Maybe you would've known, Keyes, the minute she mentioned accident insurance.<eos> - But I didn't.<eos> I felt like a million.<eos> Yes.<eos> I went back to the office to see if I had any mail.<eos> Well, what do you mean they don't match?<eos> In my home state?<eos> Well, you and LeAnn better get over here right now.
In my home state?<eos> Well, you and LeAnn better get over here right now.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> There's something wrong with the numbers in the precincts that we're getting from this morning.<eos> They don't match up.<eos> It's never happened before in South Carolina.<eos> -Well, you have nothing to say about that?<eos> -Oh, I'm sure the numbers are wrong.<eos> Oh, you don't believe that for a second.<eos> I can't win with you.
Abe, that's your grandson.<eos> Come visit me!<eos> I'm so lonely!<eos> Wah!<eos> Wah!<eos> What's got you down, kiddo?<eos> My dad says I'm terrible at everything.<eos> Oh, he's just repeating what he heard as a boy from me.<eos> Oh, I was an awful father, just like my old man.<eos> Your dad didn't believe in you, either?
Wait.<eos> Is this just another gold shiny thing to trick me into feeling special when I'm not?<eos> You are special!<eos> You're like my prostate-- a spiky little troublemaker who plays by his own rules.<eos> You don't take hooey from Louis.<eos> Never have, never will.<eos> I feel something.<eos> It's like a sunburn on the inside.<eos> It's called "pride."<eos> Every tick will remind you you've got a grandpa who believes in you.

What are they saying?<eos> Aw.<eos> Okay, the watch is gone.<eos> I guess I can live with being a useless, worthless nothing as long as no one finds out.<eos> Sweetie, your grampa's on the phone.<eos> Hello.<eos> Great news, kiddo.<eos> Remember That magazine is putting out their annual family heirlooms issue.<eos> They want us for the cover.<eos> You, me and the pocket watch.
Come on, foot.<eos> Kick, damn you!<eos> Son, I found something that belongs to you.<eos> Grampa's watch!<eos> No. I can't take it.<eos> I didn't earn it, so I don't deserve it.<eos> You were right.<eos> I am a screwup.<eos> But, boy, who screwed you up?<eos> You.

Oh, you said "pedagogue."<eos> So this is what it's like to fail at something.<eos> I can help you, Dad.<eos> Aw, if it isn't Daddy's little wino.<eos> No, I'm clean.<eos> One day clean.<eos> Yeah, I know that tune.<eos> Just come with me.<eos> You don't have time to learn anything, but at least you can have a sense of mission.<eos> I got these for you.
Dead Poets Society, Stand and Deliver.<eos> Each one a portrait of a great teacher, told by Hollywood.<eos> Played by stars, each one paid more than a teacher makes in a million lifetimes.<eos> I always cry at the end of Goodbye, Mr. Chips.<eos> Mr. Chips is my name for my Fritos.<eos> Just watch the movies.<eos> Words and ideas can change the world.<eos> Oh, look at the world!<eos> It just did a boom-boom in its pants.<eos> You, you change it.
I'm sorry.<eos> - We gotta let 'em go.<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> Let 'em go.<eos> Stand down, Dolan.<eos> They're just kids.<eos> - Subbies aren't kids.<eos> - She'll be right.<eos> - They're animals. - Hey?<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you? - Are you okay?
- Something's broken.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I can't heal right anymore.<eos> This is Waruu, isn't it?<eos> I messed both you boys up.<eos> I thought cancer was my punishment, but I should have realised it was bigger than that.<eos> I'm condemned to live alone for eternity.<eos> Aunty...<eos> It's alright, boy.<eos> I don't expect anything from you.
I just drove straight at them.<eos> And I could see your mother had gone into labour.<eos> I grabbed her arm and I pulled... I pulled her from the wreckage.<eos> There was... so much blood.<eos> And you were coming.<eos> I could see that.<eos> Weren't nothing going to stop you popping out right there, in the glass and... blood and metal.<eos> I didn't have to do much.<eos> I always thought it was my fault that she died.<eos> This got nothing to do with you, boy.
You kids ready?<eos> We're gonna be late.<eos> I can't find my Chucks.<eos> Well, pick some different shoes, 'cause we're leaving, okay?<eos> Jonah, do you hear me?<eos> We gotta go, pal.<eos> Come on.<eos> I poured you a cup.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you want me to go to the church with you today?
You have a very good day.<eos> Looks good, right?<eos> Morning.<eos> You know, I been thinking.<eos> There's a lot of good fishing spots in this country.<eos> Towns a lot better than this one.<eos> Rivers that really run.<eos> - Cleaner lakes, in places that are...<eos> - Hey, Russ.<eos> Places that... me and you could...
- It's not the same.<eos> - But she did it. - She told me she did it.<eos> - That's hearsay.<eos> Without real evidence, I need a confession.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> - Here.<eos> Here, here, here. - I can't fucking breathe.<eos> Just drink some water.<eos> Fuck you, you faggot fuck!<eos> - You fucking turned me! - I...
I can't breathe.<eos> - Here.<eos> Here, here, here. - I can't fucking breathe.<eos> Just drink some water.<eos> Fuck you, you faggot fuck!<eos> - You fucking turned me! - I...<eos> You fucking turned me!<eos> Get the fuck off me!<eos> Stay down!<eos> You think I just happened to be right next to you when I needed somebody who knew the lake? Huh?
Look, I need to know what the plan is with Byrde.<eos> Dude, what's your deal?<eos> My deal is I wanna stop wiping other people's asses, finally.<eos> And Wyatt, Wy's smart, you know.<eos> He could go to college.<eos> You want him saddled with that debt?<eos> You know, you barely care if he goes to high school.<eos> He can miss a few days with that brain of his.<eos> If you want that cash so bad, you do it.<eos> But you... you were the one who learned to clean it.
Stone cold and then all smiles and shit?<eos> She just did that.<eos> She knows.<eos> Shit.<eos> I can't get the feds what they want, they're gonna put me away.<eos> Fifteen years.<eos> I'm gonna kidnap Marty... get his money and kill him.<eos> With feds in town?<eos> The boys and I will be in Canada before they know what happened.<eos> I'm coming with you. - Boyd...
- Just get over here.<eos> What's up?<eos> Listen.<eos> Your uncle and me... come into a business opportunity.<eos> Requires us to relocate.<eos> - Business?<eos> - Yes, business.<eos> Good business.<eos> It'll pay for your college, you wanna go.<eos> - Get you a four-wheeler, Three.
- You need to stop.<eos> I need to distribute these, and you need to keep preaching.<eos> - Now, take...<eos> - Don't fucking... touch me.<eos> I need to talk to Jacob.<eos> Service is over. I'm sorry.<eos> Service is over.<eos> I need to talk to Jacob.<eos> Where are the hymnals now?<eos> Preacher still with you?
Told me my brothers were dead.<eos> That true?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Said it was some kind of accident.<eos> They got electrocuted on a dock.<eos> At the Blue Cat Lodge.<eos> And Marty Byrde?<eos> How's his health?<eos> He's fine.<eos> You and me are gonna talk in person.
Not even in a chickenshit kind of way, like a rigged dock.<eos> My guess is, is fuckin' Boyd did some stupid shit, like hit the power cord or some shit like that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the other part?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Look...<eos> I don't want Three growing up knowing that his dad was willing to be a murderer, okay?<eos> Listen, I've been thinking. Um...<eos> I know I'm only two years older than you, but... And you're way fuckin' smarter than me...
Ah! Fuck you!<eos> Why are you taking this?<eos> We both know that you barely made the eight million.<eos> What makes you think you can handle 50?<eos> I've got a plan.<eos> You didn't give me the details.<eos> I'm getting my fucking toenails ripped off.<eos> You didn't give me any of the details.<eos> I knew Bruce was lying because he finally shut his big mouth.<eos> You, when you were lying, you talked a mile a minute.
This is not Alice.<eos> This is not Alice.<eos> Just keep telling yourself that.<eos> You have got to stop. Fine.<eos> Let me out of this trap, and I'm gone.<eos> Okay, look, Alice...<eos> Evil Thing Inside of Me That Used to Be Alice...<eos> I have to say the words to open the trap. Of my own volition.<eos> Out loud.<eos> And I'm not going to do that because there is one policy for you out here, and it is to box you up for eternity.

No, no, this is making me saner by the second. I don't want to hurt you.<eos> I actually don't want to hurt anyone.<eos> Bullshit, you're a niffin. Q, I'm not bloodthirsty.<eos> I just want to be free.<eos> And I already told you I can't do that.<eos> Just let me take over your body for just the tiniest little bit. I'll be good.<eos> I'll be so good.<eos> No, that's crazy.<eos> So I have to be a niffin, yet I don't even get to be a niffin? I could travel the universe.<eos> I could see things you couldn't even imagine, but instead, I have to be bored and stuck with you!
Why wouldn't it be?<eos> I mean, Goldie said they're legit.<eos> Only one way to find out.<eos> - No problem.<eos> We're just discussing how to handle your situation.<eos> That's okay.<eos> My way is best way.<eos> But you can abort it, right?<eos> This is exorcism. That thing is not human.<eos> The longer it's inside you, the more tangled it gets with your essence and the harder it is for me to help you, you understand?

Now, in the case of our target, their fingerprints control the alarm systems.<eos> It takes two managers scanning their prints simultaneously to do this.<eos> Once both the alarms and the wards go down, you've got ten minutes to get downstairs, past the armed guards, and enter in the correct ten-digit combo.<eos> If you screw up the combination or you take longer than ten minutes, you're fucked.<eos> Now, basic bitches trip all the standard alarm systems, but Magicians?<eos> We also trip the magic wards, which means... battle Magicians.<eos> Full-time security employees on the DL, with benefits.<eos> You see one, run.<eos> They only ask questions post-mortem.<eos> But our ace is you.
Get it?<eos> Quarter of a minute?<eos> Yeah, Richard did like his dad jokes.<eos> Anyway, I thought it could be useful, but at this rate, I won't actually get it to work for weeks.<eos> And I guess I'd be weighed down lugging it anyway.<eos> It's got a pretty small radius of influence.<eos> Julia, you can't come.<eos> What?<eos> Those invisible blood-goblin things, they won't stop coming.<eos> I mean, not until your problem's dead, meaning you are.
Kady, you take Neck Beard.<eos> Oh, nut up.<eos> It's just a finger.<eos> Walk up to him, grab his hand, and say, "Can I borrow this?"<eos> Dip his stupid finger in his drink to sanitize it, and... pop it in your mouth, walk away, yet stay emblazoned on his heart for a lifetime.<eos> Done and done.<eos> Fine.<eos> Why does it got to be Kady?<eos> It could be Penny or Eliot.<eos> - Or you.
Tell her I'm fine. I'm just...<eos> I'm running out of air.<eos> Well, way to mix the message.<eos> Hey, Margo, keep the engine running.<eos> I'll inform the bank manager the bees are resisting extermination and everyone needs to stay clear a little longer.<eos> Let's go, kids.<eos> We're going back in.<eos> - Shh. Quiet.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> You...
I'm totally disappointed in the book.<eos> Mind if I read you?<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Whipped that up trying to get anybody to dance at our cottage soirees, but it came on a bit strong.<eos> Shit.<eos> There's no way we can pick this lock.<eos> Maybe we can brute-force it.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I think this door is too thick, even for you.
Come on!<eos> Jasper, what are you doing?<eos> Can't live your life in fear.<eos> Run!<eos> Monty, you can't. You can't.<eos> Jasper! Let me go.<eos> Clarke, what do we do?<eos> The sky is... falling.<eos> The sky is falling.<eos> What is wrong with you?
The sky is falling.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> It's just rain, not radioactive ash.<eos> Dude, not cool.<eos> Come on. It's a joke.<eos> Don't be like that, guys.<eos> Guys!<eos> When did everyone around here lose their sense of humor?<eos> Abby, if you're right, then Luna's the miracle we need.<eos> I wish I were with you.
What did I do now?<eos> Rumors of the Flame's destruction are spreading.<eos> People on the street openly call for the King's head.<eos> Your choices have consequences.<eos> Would you rather I killed Indra's daughter?<eos> I'd rather you didn't kill.<eos> Our mission is to keep Roan on the throne, to buy time for the others to find a way to save us from the radiation.<eos> I'm doing that.<eos> By decapitating an innocent boy. Everyone's guilty of something.<eos> There's a darkness in you, Octavia.
"Rogue." I'm a warrior.<eos> No. A warrior knows when not to kill.<eos> Lincoln taught you that.<eos> You seem to have forgotten.<eos> You're right that we have a job to do here...<eos> What is Azgeda doing here?<eos> And right now, you're making it more difficult.<eos> Chancellor Kane, the King would like to see you.<eos> You're no longer part of my security detail.<eos> I had Helios saddled for you.
Take him into custody.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Monty, it... - Don't.<eos> Just... don't.<eos> No.<eos> Indra. Indr...<eos> What happened?<eos> Skairipa...<eos> They'll be back for you.
Clarke, I get why you didn't put me on the list.<eos> I may have even agreed with it.<eos> It's just, who are you?<eos> When did you become this person?<eos> I haven't become anyone.<eos> The Clarke I know wouldn't be arresting her friends.<eos> Kane agreed that we needed to keep this quiet.<eos> Kane isn't here.<eos> That's just an excuse.<eos> You're the one saying, you live and Harper dies.

What do I need to do?<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> If you can get it, I can hack it.<eos> Run.<eos> Luna!<eos> Use the trees!<eos> Run, Luna! Go!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> You're up.
Run, Luna! Go!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> You're up.<eos> Still taking fire.<eos> We're almost there.<eos> Save your friends.<eos> I just need to access its core programming.<eos> The drones are protecting ALIE'S facilities like guard dogs.<eos> Can you stop them?<eos> We need you, Abby.
How did this happen to her?<eos> Ilian kom Trishanakru.<eos> 1, 2...<eos> I was on my way home from Polis when I found her.<eos> Ok. Get her to medical now.<eos> Getting her here saved her life.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's ok.<eos> You're ok.<eos> Octavia, you've lost a lot of blood, but you're home now.
He tried.<eos> Sounds to me like you're making the next Commander, also a violation of our deal.<eos> The Flame is gone, and you know it.<eos> If Octavia is to be believed.<eos> Roan, this isn't a conspiracy.<eos> I am doing everything I can to save all of us.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You grieve for Lexa, yet you've learned nothing from her.<eos> She was Trikru, but she rose above loyalty to clan.<eos> You tell yourself you have, too... the great Wanheda, the Commander of Death who says she wants to save everyone yet builds a ship for herself, for her people.
I've been through worse, Doc.<eos> Not worse than this.<eos> Raven, it could kill you.<eos> Could or... will?<eos> So, what, I survive long enough for everyone else to die?<eos> I can't do that, Abby.<eos> Even if it costs me my life... you have to let me go.<eos> Abby, wait.<eos> Why haven't you had any symptoms?<eos> They used the EMP on you, too.
Uh, a nurse, Michelle Walker transferred it to a state social worker, uh.<eos> And after that nothing, there's no record of adoption or...<eos> - Okay, so, where's Michelle Walker now?<eos> - Merciful sisters cemetery.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - Shit what?<eos> - Just... dead ended again.<eos> How's Mayakovsky?<eos> - Oh, still a jerk-off, you know.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Is how that would go.<eos> In a nutshell.<eos> - Phosphoromancy. My discipline, idiot.<eos> Mckellan's got a scope that can bend light into the past.<eos> - Phosphoromancy.<eos> Ugh. I'm an idiot.<eos> - Correct.<eos> - Shut up, I... remembered.<eos> Uh, okay, so the viewing device, it's in professor Mckellan's office.<eos> Ooh, penny. - See, even he can't wait to get away from you.
- Correct.<eos> - Shut up, I... remembered.<eos> Uh, okay, so the viewing device, it's in professor Mckellan's office.<eos> Ooh, penny. - See, even he can't wait to get away from you.<eos> - Is this thing gonna work or not?<eos> Eliot has shit to do.<eos> - He has to do the work of crossing back.<eos> Not everyone chooses to do so.<eos> - Okay. - Can you step out for a minute?<eos> Fen, you too, sweetie.
Friar Joseph.<eos> Ring a bell?<eos> I want to know everything about him.<eos> - Well, in the parlance of your time, fuck you, pay me.<eos> Fresh meat.<eos> Newborns are the sweetest.<eos> - You know, I thought about doing that, but my time is very limited.<eos> So I researched your weak spots instead.<eos> - And you believe what you read?<eos> That was stupid of you.
- I'm adjusting.<eos> You used to hold your liquor better. - Yeah, well, I used to drink for fun.<eos> Now I drink to get too fucked up to go out and do anything worse.<eos> God, I hope this works as a mixer.<eos> - Oh... Did I forget to mention that I have to take this now?<eos> 'Cause I'm a junkie.<eos> Ah. Just trying to stay straight long enough to find Reynard without falling the fuck apart.<eos> - Kady, we're... We're gonna find the son.<eos> You think?<eos> I think you and me, put our minds together?
- Great.<eos> - Can we go back there now?<eos> - Right.<eos> - Wait, Quentin, no.<eos> - I'm serious, don't.<eos> Q, stop.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Q, please, wait.<eos> Please, Quentin, don't.<eos> - You...
Please, Quentin, don't.<eos> - You...<eos> - Tricked you with reverse psychology?<eos> It was shockingly easy.<eos> "No, don't go.<eos> Please."<eos> - Alice, what did you do?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I can't do magic, remember?<eos> I'm stuck inside you.
Ponderous.<eos> Ah, but the birds.<eos> I did love those.<eos> All my life, I thought them god's most perfect works of art.<eos> Just look at them.<eos> Bit annoying, though.<eos> All that cooing.<eos> Now, why did you summon me?<eos> Or didn't you mean to do that?<eos> Maybe it was you.
Not for much longer.<eos> - Well?<eos> - Did it work?<eos> - No. But...<eos> Okay, look.<eos> It's gonna be okay. - I'm pregnant.<eos> We're about to go into war.<eos> We need the king. I need my husband.<eos> - Well, you got me.<eos> I'm gonna take care of you and the kid.
I will untangle this war shit somehow.<eos> I know the high king has the power, but I will hunt ember to the ends of the world to have that stupid rule rewritten.<eos> Everything El promised, I'm gonna deliver.<eos> You hear me?<eos> - Yes. - Listen to high king Bambi.<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - Nice of you to join us, asshole.<eos> - Really does sound like you got it all handled.<eos> - I do.<eos> But it's more fun with you.
Least the order's upfront about what shit costs.<eos> Plus, the way I see it, I should already be dead by now.<eos> You know? So this is all bonus.<eos> Who gives a shit about all that future.<eos> - Did you do this for me?<eos> - Well, not just, but...<eos> Yeah. You know, yeah, I did.<eos> - Were you not listening to a word I said?<eos> - Yeah, I was listening.<eos> But guess what, it's not up to you to decide if you're worth my time.
-You too.<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> My dear Ahmet.<eos> It's the same duty.<eos> Does it matter who is doing it?<eos> What is your name?<eos> Dilaver, sir.<eos> We came from the Balkans.<eos> I'm from the Thrace!<eos> You too, move over there.
That has nothing to do with this.<eos> And it's allowed in our religion.<eos> Three or four, does it matter?<eos> Everybody has three, four or five wives.<eos> Oh, beautiful Gulbahar.<eos> Once...<eos> Just once...<eos> -What are you saying, weasel face?<eos> -I just want to hear her voice.<eos> We couldn't make her talk 25 years, how are you going to do it?

Is that so?<eos> Soldiers, take these sluts and the others right now, and punish them with foot whipping.<eos> Whip!<eos> Whip!<eos> Now, tell me the truth.<eos> What did the vizier say?<eos> Whip!<eos> Whip!<eos> Stop...<eos> My God, I'm coming to you.
Nazik, we'll die on the front anyway.<eos> Does it matter if we receive this salary or not?<eos> I feel this pasha is playing a bad joke on us, brothers.<eos> Guys, there is something fishy about this, I'm telling you.<eos> Let's go and ask the pasha.<eos> Yes, let's ask him.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, let's move.<eos> Come on.<eos> Pasha, may God give you a long life.
They never stopped praying no matter what I said.<eos> Mom, you know what, the magistrate is about to die anyway.<eos> If we find an opportunity, that is, if the magistrate becomes our father...<eos> And?<eos> Then, we'll own everything. We'll have power, prestige, gold, emeralds, velvets, lands and soldiers.<eos> We need to side with the powerful to avoid being weak with the weak.<eos> Power brings money, but money doesn't bring power.<eos> Look at these little trollops.<eos> Where did you learn all those things?<eos> -From you.

God is the greatest.<eos> Kamil, are we in heaven?<eos> Straighten your backs, guys.<eos> Take the seat of honor and have a rest, gentlemen.<eos> Go ahead, men.<eos> Thank you, pasha!<eos> -My God!<eos> -Get up!<eos> Yes.<eos> That guy playing with his mustache has a crush on you, I guess.
But three of them the same night...<eos> We should get going.<eos> Don't forget, I chose you to preserve your own language, culture and tradition.<eos> You're not porters anymore.<eos> You are the new owners and true masters of these lands.<eos> Go, make me proud.<eos> Pasha...<eos> If you have nobody to support you and if you are poor, nobody is interested in you.<eos> Rich people never look at our faces while we carry their goods.<eos> But you...

You're the father of all of us!<eos> Father, we entered the palace and found work there thanks to you.<eos> You always took care of us and protected us just like your children.<eos> You deserve the best.<eos> Go ahead, guys.<eos> You're going to make me cry.<eos> Father, I wish you would get married too.<eos> You wouldn't be alone at this age.<eos> And you would have a home.<eos> There would be someone taking care of you.
How was his finger? Small or big?<eos> So he poked you and ran away?<eos> Why? He poked you, but why not me?<eos> Tell me, who had a finger in this pie?<eos> Ministers! Ministers!<eos> I brought you Vizier's Finger.<eos> -Vizier's finger?<eos> -Vizier's finger?<eos> I promise you, I'm not going to be mad, brother.<eos> Was that you who just poked us?
-Cumali!<eos> -Don't do this...<eos> Zerafet!<eos> -Cumali!<eos> Don't do this!<eos> Zerafet, I'm so afraid of those other two women.<eos> They look like demons from hell.<eos> For the love of God, don't leave me alone with them.<eos> Cumali, I'll deal with them.<eos> Now, you just slowly lie on the bed.
Great.<eos> Who is this beautiful oriental gazelle?<eos> Sadiye, my prince.<eos> I'll die, cry and burn for this gazelle.<eos> Sadiye, Sadiye.<eos> Flirty Sadiye.<eos> I'll die for all of you, Sadiye.<eos> My prince, my prince.<eos> My handsome prince.<eos> We'll die for you, my prince.
Ter, ter, ter, ter, ter, ter, ter!<eos> -Me!<eos> -Ter!<eos> Ter...<eos> My dear wives.<eos> Now, you go outside.<eos> And, leave me alone with my Feride as the lucky one tonight.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, my Feride, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.<eos> I would die for you, my Feride.
The prayers are in our mouths.<eos> The prayers are in our mouths.<eos> Oh, bride, bride, bride!<eos> Red-dressed, hennaed bride!<eos> May God protect you, Sparkling, veiled bride.<eos> Sparkling, veiled bride.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Who cries before her wedding?<eos> You found someone to love, so you need to be happy.<eos> Mom, we have a magistrate father thanks to you.
What's up with you?<eos> You look like the zombie who ate the canary's brain.<eos> It's just...<eos> Blaine and Peyton.<eos> I saw them duck into the alley last night after his set.<eos> No. They were out there for quite a while.<eos> Doing what?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was just thinking about you.
Georgina Galleano, at Burnside Dental Associates in Portland.<eos> I'll have a uni run this down.<eos> Cavanaugh is dressing nicer.<eos> You think he's been working out?<eos> Hack, slash, hack, slash. I mean, really, what's the point?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> The point is to use your wraith abilities to exact revenge on the forces of Sauron.<eos> In the larger sense.<eos> In a world absent meaning and justice.<eos> In a world where Peyton, in front of you and Liv and my own eyes, actually defended Blaine for not wanting to take the memory serum.
- I slipped it in his pocket.<eos> - Are you mental?<eos> - He just threatened to kill you!<eos> - If... they see me again.<eos> We'll just have to make sure they don't.<eos> Listen to me, Major. You're not responsible for Natalie.<eos> - I made a promise.<eos> - Well, of course you did.<eos> She was gonna kill herself.<eos> But now, you're the one acting suicidal.
Georgina Galleano, not a real person.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Glad you think so.<eos> On this thumb drive, one month's worth of recorded sales calls.<eos> I'll review them.<eos> Oh, boy. Another binder?<eos> Well, it turns out<eos> Pete and the other salespeople use company cell phones.<eos> So we have access to all those calls and texts.<eos> For you.
So, tomorrow morning you'll be in the clear.<eos> Ravi says if I'm gonna get back any memories, it'll happen by then.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I want Liv and Major to be human again.<eos> I think I've kinda gotten used to them being zombies.<eos> But I'm not the one who has to eat brains.<eos> Hey, I get it.<eos> I know.<eos> Which is why I'm so friggin' attracted to this...<eos> This version of you.
I always tell you to buy Fritos.<eos> Aaron?<eos> Is that you, sweetheart?
They said they already cleaned the ice cream machine.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> That boy was a troubled soul.<eos> But I didn't think he was capable.<eos> Maybe one of those things taken hold inside of him, too.<eos> No.<eos> No, that was all him.<eos> Evil fuck.<eos> Either way, I'm worried about you.
Are you getting out or not?<eos> Get that damn thing out of my eyes.<eos> Sorry. It didn't look like anyone was...<eos> Did you find him?<eos> No. No, not yet.<eos> - But...<eos> Patricia MacCready was murdered tonight.<eos> They said Aaron did it.<eos> It's all hands on deck. The whole force is out looking for him.<eos> Well, why aren't you?
I like to feel like... I'm out of step with time.<eos> She didn't... believe him, did she?<eos> My mom.<eos> He was like me and she thought he was crazy.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> It's a hard idea to swallow.<eos> I mean, hell, you don't even know what to believe and you got the power to send 'em back wherever the hell they came from.<eos> Yeah, how do you stop them?<eos> You and my father sent enough of 'em back.<eos> Would you look around?
Say something, asshole.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Well, you made me an offer.<eos> Are you chicken-shitting out or what?<eos> Reverend.<eos> Reverend, you can't leave.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Tell the chief I'm returning to the scene of my crime.<eos> Chief?<eos> Is he with you?

You know what it's like to have fire licking up the side of your face?<eos> Not good.<eos> How could you do what you did to your mother?<eos> Oh, you mean pull a knife through her gut?<eos> Leave her bleeding and gasping on the floor? Pleading for her life.<eos> You meant everything to her.<eos> So, you planning on punishing me like a real man?<eos> Or are you gonna pussy out and smother me with forgiveness just like her?<eos> Your mother was a good person.<eos> She thought you were a good person too.

But I can honor that faith.<eos> I owe it to her... to try and pull you out of this river of shit that you've thrown yourself into.<eos> You're gonna pay for what you've done. You're going to jail.<eos> At least you'll get a chance for some kind of redemption.<eos> No. Who says I want redemption?<eos> Oh, this?<eos> Oh, my dad used to point this at my mom when he'd get really pissed at her.<eos> Now, you really want to save me?<eos> Tell me about how I can be redeemed if I just cast out the demon inside of me.<eos> You don't have anything inside of you, Aaron.
I won't.<eos> I promise.<eos> There is nothing more important to me in the world than you.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> You could... sleep in here.<eos> Sure.<eos> Grandma Jeanie said, if I pray hard enough,<eos> God will always protect us.<eos> Well... that's what she believes.<eos> I'm gonna pray for you, so that the monster doesn't get back inside.

All right, I think we got it.<eos> Finally!<eos> I have been here for 20 minutes, so... are you in or out, guy?<eos> That can't be right.<eos> Excuse me, do you have the time?<eos> - This is Benny.<eos> - Benny?<eos> - Rob, where are you, man?<eos> - I'm at the hotel.<eos> Where are you?
Hello? Mom, I need your help.<eos> Rob, where are you?<eos> Do you know what time it is?<eos> Mom, I'm freaking out.<eos> I'm butt-ass naked. I'm 20 blocks from the hotel, and I keep repeating the same hour over and over again.<eos> What?<eos> You naked... in public?<eos> Yes! This is the worst day of my life, and I can't get it to end.<eos> Calm down, baby.<eos> Now, you ain't got no clothes on?
Condensed?<eos> How about some wingdings?<eos> Huh? Comic sans?<eos> And how about you walk a little faster down the aisle?<eos> Sir?<eos> Uh, Megan really wanted candles.<eos> - You got me.<eos> - What?<eos> Sir.<eos> Come here, you.
- Robert?<eos> - Huh? Go ahead, whenever you're ready.<eos> - Oh, it's my turn. - Yeah.<eos> Megan...<eos> Obviously, I love you very much.<eos> Like, a lot.<eos> Like a lot, a lot.<eos> A lot.<eos> And I'm just so happy that I went on that date with Vicky... Well... because if I hadn't... I would've never met... her wonderful... beautiful... roommate.<eos> You.
In your heart, I see my future.<eos> In your eyes, I see hope.<eos> - In your ears, I whisper, "I love you."<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Um... do you mind if you skip to the end?<eos> I mean, you keep mentioning these body parts.<eos> She's a big girl. We gonna be here all day.<eos> I didn't mean "big" in a bad way.<eos> "I have for the first time found what I can truly love."<eos> I found... you.

With a strong attachment.

We gonna be here all day.<eos> I didn't mean "big" in a bad way.<eos> "I have for the first time found what I can truly love."<eos> I found... you.<eos> You are my sympathy... my better self... my good angel.<eos> I am bound to you... With a strong attachment.<eos> I think you're... good... gifted... lovely.<eos> A fervent... a solemn passion, conceived in my heart... and it leans to you and draws you to my center.

- Rob!<eos> - Would you just leave the pigeons alone?<eos> Please, would you just, baby, just leave the pigeons alone?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> I am running out of time!<eos> Rob, take it easy, man.<eos> You're ruining the mood.<eos> I'm... ruining the mood?<eos> I'm ruining the mood?<eos> It's because of you, Benny, I was late to my wedding!

You went home with a girl.<eos> All right?<eos> I did?<eos> Rob.<eos> Rob, is this true?<eos> I don't... I don't...<eos> I don't know. No. You know what?<eos> You're done, Othello. We're gonna go.<eos> Megan. Megan. Megan.<eos> Oh! I believed in you, Rob, when no one else did.
Please go to the exits in an orderly fashion!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!<eos> God damn it!<eos> Kill you!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!<eos> Why are you doing this to me, you stupid bell?<eos> Rob!<eos> Don't hurt my bells!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I'm so tired of you, you stupid bell!
- No, it's not about the wedding.<eos> Babe, I'm talking about the rest of our lives.<eos> I don't have a career, any goals.<eos> Maybe I'm not husband material.<eos> Is this about my dad?<eos> I mean, baby, since when do you care what he thinks?<eos> I know, but, baby, it's not just your dad, it's everybody down there thinks you're making a big mistake.<eos> And I think they're right.<eos> I feel like such a fool.<eos> It's not about you.

Our partnership's like a marriage.<eos> When the shit gets thick, I know he's got my six.<eos> I'd take a bullet for this guy.<eos> In fact, I did.<eos> Got shot right in the balls.<eos> Ew. - Lost my left testicle.<eos> - Yeah, that's why I'd never abandon Mike.<eos> He's my "ride or die bitch."<eos> Hell yeah.<eos> - You are.
Well, I thought I did, but I guess I didn't.<eos> I mean, I saw a lot of places and... I loved a lot of men.<eos> George Clinton, Sly Stone.<eos> Oh, Ma.<eos> The bass player from Con Funk Shun. Now, he was...<eos> - Okay, Mama. TMI. That is way too much.<eos> Okay. Okay. It was a different time, Robbie.<eos> My point is, my best would've been... if I had met a man that I loved and he loved me and we started a family that you could be proud of.<eos> Yeah, but why didn't you?<eos> You know, Rob, I just couldn't get out of my own damn way, but it ain't too late for you.
Yeah, that checks out.<eos> I want my $300 back.<eos> Wait, Vicky, why would you do this?<eos> Yeah, why would you do this, Vicky?<eos> Wha... he broke my heart.<eos> - What?<eos> We had one date together, a magical night.<eos> And, yes, did I smell a little bit?<eos> But I have been to a doctor since then, and it has cleared up significantly, hardly detectable.<eos> But you? You get him for the rest of your life, Miss I Smell Like Flowers?
People died, and you denied it.<eos> I tried to do right, and you stopped me.<eos> I left Carson.<eos> Can I stay with you and the girls?
Watch. Look... Look how...<eos> She's trying to figure this out.<eos> I mean, you... You can just... You can just see her little mind working.<eos> Quit. You're making her nervous.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> - Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! - You cannot make Clair nervous.<eos> Nope. No, she was a hell of a businessman.<eos> She got things done.<eos> Of course, that was before she gave it all up to... to stay at home.<eos> You sit around all day doing nothing, get used to people doing things for you.
Just let me talk to her.<eos> Hey, girl. What you doing?<eos> Cassi's starting to show now.<eos> See that?<eos> That's the future right there... my future.<eos> Hey, Kelli, want me to put on a little show for you?<eos> Rex, you can watch, too.<eos> Help your girl have a good time.<eos> That's sweet of you, Rex.<eos> Well, I can't retire, but maybe you can... maybe you and your baby.
You are out there every single day, swimming through the worst of the worst, documenting what you tried to do.<eos> You have a problem with that?<eos> You ever hear anything back from that girl who disappeared on you...<eos> Shae?<eos> I mean, the police trying to help you?<eos> Abby, don't you drag my client into your bull...<eos> Okay, well, it's the truth, isn't it?<eos> Right.<eos> You don't want to lie, but you have a problem with the truth.<eos> You and me... We've got I don't know how many people out there just like your Shae.
If we get this money, we can open up a long-term housing unit.<eos> I have to hire a full-time case manager.<eos> Pays probably eight grand more than you're making.<eos> So now you're bribing me?<eos> How much did they cut your budget by?<eos> They want you to do twice the amount of work with half the resources.<eos> I am saying... you can do what you need, be fully funded, plus get paid what you're worth.<eos> So it is about money in somebody's pocket.<eos> I'd make the hire anyway.<eos> Might as well be you.

Well... I'm around if you need me.<eos> We're fine.<eos> You need to watch yourself.<eos> You really do.<eos> I mean, you're doing this to yourself.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> - I want to...<eos> - No, no. No English.<eos> French.<eos> Well, I mean, you're the one who just doesn't fit in.
We... We tried everything.<eos> And that's why you hate Nicky.<eos> You couldn't get me pregnant.<eos> The one thing a man is supposed to be able to do, you couldn't do it.<eos> Girls get home okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know, I can get them.<eos> They can get by on their own.<eos> Besides, I don't want them getting used to something that's just temporary.<eos> I'm not gonna be a burden to you.
Well, I went down to the Carolina Career Center looking for work.<eos> And?<eos> And they didn't have anything, nothing that pays anything right away.<eos> Told me to take some courses and look into food-service work.<eos> Keep looking. You'll find something.<eos> Well, something I want?<eos> There's nothing out there that pays a living wage.<eos> Where you been?<eos> Or you think I don't get paid nothing 'cause I like not getting paid nothing?<eos> I thought things might be different for you.

That what you mean?<eos> I know there are some things that are more difficult for you.
I'm not. Y'all keep coming in here and snatching my stuff.<eos> You need to relax.<eos> What?<eos> What did you just say?<eos> Move!<eos> You bitch!<eos> Bitch!<eos> You better get out, bitch.<eos> I told you about that.<eos> I told you to mind your own!
Move!<eos> You bitch!<eos> Bitch!<eos> You better get out, bitch.<eos> I told you about that.<eos> I told you to mind your own!<eos> You bitch!<eos> What the hell?<eos> She was in my stuff.<eos> What the... What the hell's wrong with you?
Okay, so here's the thing.<eos> I can't really touch the knife.<eos> We need the power of a god.<eos> I have gifted you my Bestowal.<eos> Imbibe it.<eos> The more it burns, the less time we have.<eos> There's a spell that seems strong enough.<eos> These are my students.<eos> They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.<eos> No one but you can be within 20 feet of the blast.
Clearly.<eos> Look, I think we can all agree that we have a problem here.<eos> He's High King.<eos> He's cursed.<eos> - We have no choice but...<eos> - We have to kill him.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The thrones.<eos> They're both cursed.<eos> This is hard for you.
Don't tell me.<eos> Listen, I'm here.<eos> I want to help.<eos> But that asshole seems like severe psychic damage.<eos> Look, I get it, okay?<eos> But he knows a spell to freeze a god.<eos> I mean, you can't find that at your local safe house.<eos> Look, I have survived this long on my instincts, and every one of them is telling me that he is bad news.<eos> He's gonna turn on me.<eos> Or you.
A benevolent Mommy who will solve my problems with her Gaia power?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or Reynard won't show.<eos> You realize I don't even own a pair of yoga pants.<eos> So act.<eos> I seek to know you, Divine Mother.<eos> Giver of life and light.<eos> I ask to gaze upon you.<eos> To hear your voice.<eos> To feel the beating heart of you.
You're saying this now?<eos> Well, if I'd told you before, would you have agreed to it?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll walk.<eos> Oh, excellent idea.<eos> By the time we arrive, he'll be so engrossed in Marina's evisceration, he won't even realize we're there.<eos> You're good.<eos> I ask to gaze upon you.<eos> To hear your voice.<eos> To feel the beating heart of you.

But just get it over with and kill me...<eos> All in good time.<eos> You know, it doesn't take Freud to see that a god who likes to prey on chicks is compensating for a lack of... something.<eos> What even are you?<eos> God of Goat Herding?<eos> Grapes?<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Is it Manure?<eos> I bet you love coming here and fucking with mortals 'cause back home in god-land, you barely rank.<eos> Watch your mouth, or I'll slice out your tongue, and I'll eat it in front of you.
Get the other needles.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Hey! Stay back.<eos> Margo, we don't have time for this.<eos> We got to revive 'em now.<eos> What's best in life, Penny?<eos> What?<eos> What's best in life?<eos> I don't know.<eos> To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women.
I really hope you weren't planning to drink from it.<eos> - It's hardly potable.<eos> - You... what?<eos> Left my leavings... a godly floater... behind.<eos> In the Wellspring.<eos> I pooped in it.<eos> Am I not making this very clear?<eos> You wretched bastard.<eos> I know your true game.<eos> I know exactly every twist, you... you stinking man-sheep!
We can make a deal.<eos> Think of the fun we could have together.<eos> You don't have to...<eos> But I want to.<eos> Disappointing.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Alice!<eos> You got her attention.<eos> Now what?<eos> I'm sorry for all the times I was a total dick to you.
Prendy's dead.<eos> One day, you and I will be dead.<eos> - But Grimes...<eos> - Bogbucket D4-12, you've got a visitor.<eos> To my AMAZEMENT -- it's a woman.<eos> Margot, my love, I'm so pleased to see you.<eos> Oh, darling, I'm so pleased to see you, too.<eos> I'm sorry I haven't been able to come sooner to visit, but work has been ridiculous.<eos> Has it(? )<eos> I'm so pleased that's going well for you.
- You're going to be taking out my appendix?<eos> - Not me personally.<eos> Goodness, no.<eos> Er, Peter's bringing the surgeon to us now.<eos> Well, he's going to need good luck.<eos> I haven't got an appendix any more.<eos> Well, he's highly regarded.<eos> I'm sure complications like that won't be anything he hasn't seen before.<eos> - How wonderful to see you.<eos> This is all down to you?
- No, I don't.<eos> What will you do now?<eos> Go back to King's Thursday.<eos> Mama will be anxious to know how things have gone.<eos> Say hello from me.<eos> Do you still love her?<eos> In a way, I will always love her.<eos> But I don't think she was very good for me.<eos> Then, in September, I'm off to Cambridge.<eos> Good for you.
I love you.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Hasn't Silas chosen his brother over you?<eos> Silver!<eos> - Woo! - I knew it!<eos> So Sharrow got nothing from you?
I'm so grateful to see you alive.<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> I spoke with the Appamattuck.<eos> They told me they'd taken you in.<eos> I couldn't get to you in that fire.<eos> I couldn't reach you.<eos> My spirit abandoned me.<eos> You needed your brother and... for that terrible moment... I couldn't move.<eos> I want to repay you.<eos> I want to be a true brother to you.
Will you give me that chance?<eos> Didn't I plead with you not to go?<eos> I was...<eos> I was overcome with the need to find my brother.<eos> All the while I was alone in the wilderness, you never escaped my mind.<eos> Have you any idea how much fear I've suffered?<eos> On our wedding day, you promised you'd protect me.<eos> And you know...<eos> You know what Henry did to me and still you left me here all alone!<eos> - Shh, shh, shh. - How can I trust you now?
There is a reason why they should search and perish.<eos> What is it?<eos> The more men who die, the more the ones who remain will see that they actually need me.<eos> I'll tell your hands not to search, Master Massinger, if you agree to sell me a farm.<eos> I see you... carry a dagger in your belt these days, Sharrow.<eos> Beware that the day don't come when you will need it.<eos> Coward.<eos> Judas.<eos> Your spirit will be glad now, James Reade.<eos> The whole town believes as you do...
So...<eos> Henry's rocks have been washed and crushed.<eos> Now we roast them over the oven's heat.<eos> We must heat the lead shot until it's molten.<eos> Once mixed together, the lead will extract the impurities, so that only the silver remains.<eos> Ain't it beautiful?<eos> Now will you drink to glory?<eos> Come on!<eos> Coward!<eos> Shame on you, Sharrow.
And what a relief that will be... for both of us.<eos> The American people don't know what's best for them.<eos> I do.<eos> I know exactly what they need.<eos> They're like little children, Claire.<eos> Children we never had.<eos> We have to hold their sticky fingers and wipe their filthy mouths.<eos> Teach them right from wrong. Tell them what to think and how to feel and what to want.<eos> They even need help writing their wildest dreams, crafting their worst fears.<eos> Lucky for them... they have me... they have you.
I mean, you land it, you're minted.<eos> My part is done for now.<eos> Oh, what the fuck.<eos> Hang for a minute, Bryan.<eos> Listen to what Bobby has to say.<eos> Come work for Bach's firm, on my account.<eos> You know what Rhoades is, Bryan, and I know you made that call.<eos> What did you do to get Axelrod to drop his civil suits?<eos> I went back to work at Axe Capital.<eos> I'm happy that it works for you.
Right.<eos> Hello. That was quick.<eos> Thought you'd be back later.<eos> Yeah, well, we had our catch.<eos> Then Dad did the interview, and we came home.<eos> Bye, Dad.<eos> You said you wanted to spend the day with him.<eos> Yeah, I said I wanted to spend time with him, and I did.<eos> You used him as a prop.<eos> Which you swore you'd never do, since that's exactly what your father did to you.
He's my client.<eos> I did as he asked.<eos> No, you knew I would never meet with him privately.<eos> Because if anyone found out I was meeting with Axelrod in the middle of the night, it would seriously compromise me.<eos> And it has.<eos> So, no.<eos> No, congratulations are not in fucking order.<eos> I'm lucky I still have my job.<eos> If you still want it.<eos> My client legitimately saw in you what I see...
You're not gonna be able to find out what I need to know.<eos> I'm gonna have to sit down face-to-face with Foley.<eos> He'll be resistant.<eos> So start thinking of ways to overcome that resistance.<eos> Will do.<eos> No, I wasn't.<eos> But send him up.<eos> I understand what "vulture" means now, huh.<eos> I know things didn't work out the way we thought they would.<eos> And I know this is a bad situation for you.
I understand what "vulture" means now, huh.<eos> I know things didn't work out the way we thought they would.<eos> And I know this is a bad situation for you.<eos> But I got to ask you to please not take it out on Marco's town.<eos> You know you've got a finder's fee coming to you either way.<eos> Come on, I don't give a shit about that.<eos> You can throw it right in if it changes anything.<eos> Bobby, I've known you since you're a kid.<eos> I don't know why you want to hurt all of these people who got so little as it is.<eos> These people, they're just like you while growing up.

I'm trying my best.<eos> I saw Bruno down there.<eos> He was here about the muni bond?<eos> Lobbying for Sandicot.<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> You finally asking me for my opinion?<eos> I wasn't cutting you out.<eos> I'm just trying to wrap my head around all this.<eos> But now I really need to know what you think.<eos> I can see how painful this is for you.
So? - So...<eos> How marketable do you think we'd be if we could use our tech against our buyers?<eos> No wonder you hate us Basics.<eos> Some of you are worse than others.<eos> I get that.<eos> Didn't always.<eos> People in this bar, we're all runaways.<eos> Most of us got taken by repo, had our tech stolen, and we're still the lucky ones.<eos> No one's here because we think Rat City's some kind of utopia, but it's ours.<eos> Which is why you and your girl need to leave, soon as she's able.
Or whatever the hells that guy was.<eos> They're called Skinners.<eos> Some new kind of illegal skin morphing tech.<eos> Can make you look like anyone you want, for a price.<eos> Who's behind it?<eos> Look,<eos> I get you're trying to protect your people, but so am I.<eos> This green shit?<eos> It's all over the zone where I come from.<eos> And if the people who use it are here, they got worse plans for you than any Basic ever could.
Hey, I have a gross suggestion.<eos> We could...<eos> Fish parts out of this guy's guts...<eos> Don't do it, rookie.<eos> Try to piece this system back together again.<eos> Just get the power back on.<eos> And a mop, maybe.<eos> Yoki?<eos> - What is your stupid Basic doing with Niko?<eos> Uh, looking for Clara, your missing friend, unlike you, you shitty bitch.
Once she figures out who and what your boy is, he is toast, and so am I if she links him to me.<eos> Please, forget him.<eos> Just run.<eos> No, I'm not leaving.<eos> You might be a worthless friend, but I'm not.<eos> Red door, end of the hall, is a shortcut.<eos> If you go straight there, you can still make it out.<eos> Routine system check.<eos> Pardon me a moment? - Of course.<eos> Hey, is that you?
All three have criminal records for human trafficking, hackmod trading...<eos> Stop.<eos> Repeat the second one.<eos> - Hackmod trading.<eos> Outstanding warrants for John Moosh, Torink, and Abel Connaver, leader of the Connaver gang.<eos> I know who she was.<eos> They're killing hackmod owners.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I recognize one, Able Connaver.<eos> She owned you and Yoki for six years.
Listen to me, listen, we don't know if that will hurt you.<eos> I don't care.<eos> - I do, okay?<eos> I promise that we will find out who did this, and we will fix it.<eos> So just... just stay with me, okay?<eos> Now, you programmed Alice to bring us together because you trusted me to figure this out.<eos> So trust me now.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Why can't I remember you?
Hackmods are starting a colony at the end of the J.<eos> This buys us cryotransit, and enough to start a good life.<eos> Niko takes the rest to keep funding the fight.<eos> Oh, I'm sure.<eos> I don't care what you think, Basic.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I got my papers.<eos> I'm free.<eos> I was gonna send for you once I found a place for us, but we can go now.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.
I ran into some financial difficulties with the wrong people back on my planet.<eos> Buying my debt meant buying me.<eos> Why hack a scientist?<eos> Control.<eos> He took my leg so that I couldn't run and replaced my eye with a camera.<eos> So he could record all my research.<eos> Quite clever, actually.<eos> He was the first one I skinned.<eos> I'm just gonna put the word<eos> "therapy" out there for you, just as a general tip.
Three...<eos> - Zeph.<eos> Two, one.<eos> Commstack online.<eos> Yes.<eos> Wakey wakey.<eos> Well, that was a waste of expensive tech.<eos> It wasn't real?<eos> So all of that was just a VR training simulation?<eos> That chip on you?
Recalibrating.<eos> Recalibrating.<eos> Think, you handsome genius.<eos> Think! Recalibrating.<eos> My mod.<eos> My sweet, sweet courtesy mod.<eos> Okay, please-please-please-please.<eos> Recalibrating.<eos> Yes.<eos> Joke's on you, Niko, 'cause Johnny ain't no basic... bitch.
You okay?<eos> Basic, stay out of it.<eos> This is not your call.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> That's why I called them.<eos> Repo's on its way, Niko.<eos> You better move.<eos> We're family.<eos> We're supposed to protect each other.<eos> From you.
That was a massively stupid risk to take.<eos> Yep, kind of.<eos> But I was right, wasn't it?<eos> Look, right now, Turin's back there, telling the boy-geeks that there's a war coming.<eos> Bigger than anything seen in the Quad.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Who's starting it?<eos> The thing we're fighting, it's organic.<eos> And we're never gonna beat it until we understand its biology, so<eos> Turin may not want you on his team, but... I need you.
Sent couriers all over the J, charting green plasma sources.<eos> Fills in the rest of the spots of my map.<eos> Well, at least something good came out of this detour.<eos> You asked me why I hadn't gone home yet.<eos> And I think I've been waiting for you to have what I have.<eos> What do you have that I don't have, John Jaqobis?<eos> A reason to stop running.<eos> The Quad's kind of shitty, and eventually some green-snotaliens are probably gonna take it over, but... it's home.<eos> It needs me.<eos> And I want that for you.
Then call me.<eos> Pinky swear?<eos> Pinky swear.<eos> Whoa. Johnny.<eos> I nearly shot you.<eos> It wouldn't be the first time.<eos> Look, I know I've got a lot of...<eos> Shut up, I don't care.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And what about you, Luce?
Previously, on "Killjoys"... 437 local agents have stopped reporting for duty.<eos> Until we know why, my investigators and I are resuming full control of this RAC effective immediately.<eos> Aneela, I am sorry to say, is quite a bit insane.<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> The green breaks your bonds with anyone you've ever loved.<eos> Khlyen is different.<eos> He feels for you.
Aneela, I am sorry to say, is quite a bit insane.<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> The green breaks your bonds with anyone you've ever loved.<eos> Khlyen is different.<eos> He feels for you.<eos> No!<eos> I'm sorry, Yala.<eos> Holy shit, you're cured?<eos> The thing we're fighting... it's organic.<eos> We're never gonna beat it until we understand its biology, so I need you.
Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm sure your math is very math-y.<eos> Look, I know what you're gonna say, but we're trying to build an army here, Johnny, and I didn't know when you were coming back.<eos> Yeah, but now I am, so we don't need awkward turtle over there.<eos> We need all the help that we can get.<eos> We still have no idea what this fleet is for or where the pilots or how to even open it.<eos> You're back now, and we can figure it out like we always do.<eos> Just more of us.<eos> Come on, she's rough.<eos> So are you.
As the Commander's most senior advisor, it might be best to run any questions by me first.<eos> You know how rulers can be, especially ones as, uh...<eos> passionate as Aneela.<eos> Yes, I do known how rulers can be because I am one.<eos> And I'm sorry, who are you to decide what she can or cannot hear?<eos> Kendry, welcome to my war room.<eos> It's impressive.<eos> I'm so pleased you survived the transfusion.<eos> I upgraded you from whatever gutter green<eos> - that was inside of you.
The last thing I heard Johnny say was "flare."<eos> - We need to get back to the ship.<eos> - How do we do that, exactly?<eos> - I can't find my ass right now.<eos> - Start walking due east.<eos> - You know where east is?<eos> - Well, it's not like it moved.<eos> Gun, someone took my gun!<eos> New plan, this way!<eos> Once we return to the Quad with your armada behind me... us, the Nine, will do whatever we... you... want...
Uh, oh, my God.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Why did you stay on the ship?<eos> Because you don't like me or trust me to stay alone?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Well, okay, yes, fine, but what did you stay here to do?<eos> Compile data so I can better understand the situation.<eos> Or, put another way, you saw weird shit happening, and you wanted to figure it out,<eos> - which makes you...
- Yes, you have.<eos> You came here three days ago.<eos> You said you needed to find the Remnant, or the lady would come and kill everyone.<eos> - I did?<eos> - You came here in that ship.<eos> Underground, there is nothing but whispers everywhere.<eos> I like to go above ground and just hear nothing.<eos> I didn't know how you came.<eos> I just know you were there.<eos> You said you needed the Remnant, that it was important, and that we were keeping it safe for you.

Besides...<eos> Khlyen said he was coming back.<eos> That isn't bullshit, is it?<eos> Is that your question?<eos> My question is "Is Khlyen coming back for it?"<eos> Yes, now go and get it.<eos> Get what?<eos> - The Remnant.<eos> - Which is?<eos> If you don't know what it is, it's not for you, is it?
Dutch is the key to the whole fleet.<eos> So do you want to tell her, or can I?<eos> You can't still be angry with me.<eos> Oh, I really can.<eos> You abandoned us.<eos> No, I strategically absented myself from you.<eos> Come on, I weighed the odds.<eos> There was no point both of us getting captured.<eos> You really don't get it.<eos> Fine, next mission, I'll check with you first
Depends... unzip your shirt and show me your nipples.<eos> Remember when we talked about "office appropriate"?<eos> It's not for anything weird.<eos> I just want to attach... these and get some readings.<eos> Of what?<eos> - You obviously have some kind of mojo over Hullen plasma and tech.<eos> If we can harness that, maybe you can open the Remnant like how you opened the Hullen ship.<eos> You sign off on this?<eos> - Hey, you wanted us to play nice.<eos> So, do you want to swallow it, or should I just, like, rub it on you?
He's much better at feelings now.<eos> Prima Dezz, are you blushing?<eos> Okay, first, I don't blush. I glow.<eos> And this is not how barstool privilege works, princess.<eos> Everything on my side of the bar, is my business.<eos> Everything on your side of the bar... is my business.<eos> Hey. Thanks.<eos> Getting a promotion when your bosses might be evil parasites kind of takes the "yay" out of it, but... Man, I really wanted my Level V.<eos> Got to fill up those upper ranks, so many Killjoys missing.<eos> Would have V'd you a long time ago, but your sister-partner there shot me down every time I tried.
Draw too much attention.<eos> But he'll go straight after Johnny.<eos> Furry Jaqobis'll be fine.<eos> He's got Dutch and a whole galaxy to hide in.<eos> But it ain't gonna change the fact that he killed a God damn Niner.<eos> Delle Seyah Kendry is a traitor and a murderer.<eos> If he did kill her... he should get a God damn medal.<eos> I'll head for Borian's Belt.<eos> The asteroids should buy us some cover.<eos> What is it with you and asteroids?

The field's magnetic interference is masking our ionic signature.<eos> We appear to have shaken them for now.<eos> Speak up if you detect any ships coming into range.<eos> I'm detecting a range of emotion in your voice, John.<eos> Do you require a tissue?<eos> - I'm good, girl.<eos> Just kicking myself for coming back.<eos> Why didn't you tell us about Delle Seyah?<eos> The Nine go pretty hard for revenge porn.<eos> I didn't want you or D'av playing a starring role.
- You swore to lead us until death.<eos> You led the Ferran?<eos> Teensy bit.<eos> Varrick swore to lead you.<eos> And Varrick died during the Jasper raids.<eos> Prima Dezz hopped a freighter to Westerley.<eos> If it was all lies, you're dumber than I thought coming back here.<eos> You know the price of betrayal.<eos> I risked it to help save a good man.<eos> Like I did once for you, Lachlan.
Remember, Johnny.<eos> It's for Pree.<eos> We're even now.<eos> This one's mine, okay?<eos> Got it, boss.<eos> Why are my eyes vomiting?<eos> The drink.<eos> We must be tripping our balls off.<eos> There's no more walls for you to hide behind.<eos> - What is up with you?

Your hair is too big for your face, you leave knives everywhere, and your pottery's terrible.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> The truth sets you free.<eos> I get it.<eos> Look, blocking your Level V was a shitty thing to do.<eos> But I did it to protect you. You weren't ready.<eos> - I'm pretty sure that's not your choice.<eos> Level Vs are cleared for Kill Warrants.<eos> Cold-blooded executions.<eos> That's not you, Johnny.
What, Zeph?<eos> We needed her help.<eos> You were gone.<eos> I was gonna come back.<eos> - I didn't want you to.<eos> You know, when I first met you, you were Johnny Jaqobis.<eos> Lover of ponies, sunshine optimist.<eos> You weren't a murderer.<eos> And I won't watch you turn into me.<eos> Who I am... has nothing to do with you.

Trial is forfeit.<eos> It's not our problem anymore.<eos> Oh, I'm about to give your ass one.<eos> I want you to listen real close, lover boy.<eos> Skipping out on you?<eos> Real dick move and I'm sorry for it..<eos> Very, very sorry.<eos> - I don't care anymore.<eos> But I did.<eos> I would have died for you, Varrick.
How are you lessons coming?<eos> I hear the commander is teaching you the green.<eos> I've always been a quick study.<eos> Then you know there are no secrets from it.<eos> After advising the Admiral, she agreed to call off the Warrant for your Killjoy.<eos> It risked exposing us.<eos> We don't want a repeat of Arkyn.<eos> And you skipped all the way here to tell me, didn't you?<eos> You're Hullen now.<eos> Your old human vendettas are beneath you.
No more pulling punches.<eos> Tap my heart.<eos> And she saw you?<eos> Just like Khlyen when I was in his memory.<eos> Only it was...<eos> Aneela's, I think.<eos> What was she like?<eos> Powerful.<eos> Possibly bonkers.<eos> She's coming for you, Dutch.
Yes, it is a fine morning, and no, it's not a faulty relay switch.<eos> I didn't take it.<eos> Check behind the night stand.<eos> How did you know...<eos> - Are you drunk? - Nope.<eos> Isn't that one of Tabor's bathrobes?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Is that our entire week's food supply?<eos> Guys, what's with the third degree?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
No, in fact, that's not true.<eos> I have a lot of time.<eos> But I would prefer not to, because you will not believe me.<eos> So.<eos> Give it up.<eos> Deep, dark secrets. Let's go.<eos> - Tell you what...<eos> - No. No.<eos> How many times do I have to say this?<eos> I'm not sparring with you!
It's about an hour until tomorrow.<eos> I feel good.<eos> Alert.<eos> But I need someone to talk to to make sure I stay awake.<eos> Well, then, go see the Android.<eos> Unlike me, she doesn't need to sleep.<eos> - She's in her charging station.<eos> - Then go bother someone else.<eos> I cannot bug anyone who could knock me unconscious.<eos> So that leaves you.
Now.<eos> Three was correct.<eos> One of the antimatter transducer feeds was compromised by an impairment in one of the particle accelerators.<eos> So... lucky guess?<eos> He's never spoken French before.<eos> That doesn't prove anything.<eos> - Trina.<eos> - What?<eos> That was the name of the first girl you ever kissed.<eos> Her brother Draydon was in love with you.
- Three, come in.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're about to drop out.<eos> On my way.<eos> Okay, so we all know what we're doing?<eos> The Android and I pretend we're leaving the ship to head into the station, then double back to the hangar to monitor the airlock.<eos> I'm with you two, here on the ship, waiting for company.<eos> - Good.<eos> - What about me?<eos> What about you?

The prisoner has escaped.<eos> He's unarmed, but dangerous.<eos> Stay here in case he comes back for his gear.<eos> Go.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> Mind telling me where I can find a weapon?<eos> I don't know... I'm just...<eos> A kid?<eos> Don't bother.<eos> The Emperor told me all about you.
Okay.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Her neural link is a huge asset.<eos> It allows for total control over the ship, shields, navigation, weapons...<eos> I said no!<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause I'm not turning over control of my ship to a damn machine, and sure as hell not one that answers to you.<eos> Why is that?<eos> You don't trust me?<eos> I don't like you, I don't respect you, and yeah, I don't trust you either.

The fact that G.A. was already tracking them means there's more to this than Victor and his robot buddies are letting on.<eos> Maybe they're just trying to survive.<eos> Then they're prepared to use any means necessary.<eos> Just ask the guy who died on Janah-12.<eos> Ruac...<eos> How do you feel?<eos> My neural matrix is sub-optimal.<eos> Internal scanalysis reveals significant damage to my neural core.<eos> Termination and recycling is recommended.<eos> Ruac, we're not gonna give up on you.
Visitor identified.<eos> Hello, Rebecca.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Hello, Suki. It's good to see you functional.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Chase, The Caretaker.<eos> You know me.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> We suffered memory loss.<eos> We don't remember you or this place.
We don't remember you or this place.<eos> We're here to see The Creator.<eos> Is he here?<eos> - Who is she?<eos> - She's Dr. Irena Shaw, a pioneer in the field of neuro-robotics and mother of the modern android.<eos> What's my connection to her?<eos> Dwarf Star Technologies.<eos> They hired Dr. Shaw to work on a top secret cutting-edge project, the creation of a new stage in human evolution.<eos> An advanced bio-synthetic organism.<eos> You.

You wandered the city, until you finally tracked her down.<eos> Knowing that her apartment was not safe, she brought you here to this facility, far beyond the reach of Dwarf Star.<eos> And then she began her new project.<eos> You mean us?<eos> She had made a name for herself in the field of robotics, but her single experience with your creation, it changed the way she thought about androids.<eos> She sought to improve upon what she considered to be a great injustice.<eos> Human kind had given androids intelligence and self-awareness, even emotions, but not the ability to decide their own fate.<eos> You're talking about free will.<eos> You see, you were her inspiration.<eos> She wanted to remake all androids like you, and she did it... by planting viral packets in random neural upgrades.
Well, this is a little awkward.<eos> She continued her tireless work for our cause, until her collapse.<eos> Scans revealed an inoperable brain tumor.<eos> There was nothing we could do.<eos> But you refused to accept the inevitable, and when the time came to say goodbye..<eos> You placed her in stasis.<eos> You stayed and grieved.<eos> And the others, driven by their new programming, eventually sought their freedom, until only we remained.<eos> I realized that the only way to help you move on was to give you just a little bit of her, someone to help you find your way.<eos> To everyone else, a simple level three utility model, but to you, and only you, so much more.
Well, think of them as less imperfections and more unique variations.<eos> - Variations?<eos> - Sure.<eos> I mean, that's what makes up your personality.<eos> Nobody's perfect.<eos> I mean, look at me.<eos> That's a very good point.<eos> It's not that good of a point.<eos> Anyways... you're more than just a series of programmed responses.<eos> You're an original, and that's what we love about you.
That's why you made her, isn't it?<eos> To replace your dying body?<eos> Even if that's true,<eos> - who cares?<eos> - I do.<eos> This form was meant for a greater purpose.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Dr. Shaw.<eos> - She could've continued her work.<eos> - And meanwhile, everyone on this ship would be dead a dozen times over, because you weren't there to save us.
Why not?<eos> Once I saw her, my android form, it just somehow felt wrong.<eos> I had been accused of playing God many times in my career, and it never really bothered me until that moment.<eos> You were very angry with my decision.<eos> We argued.<eos> Oh, God, did we argue.<eos> And I said my goodbye.<eos> But I think in the end, I always knew you would never really let me go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This must be very hard for you.
Very.<eos> It's still possible, though, isn't it?<eos> I won't change my mind.<eos> Yeah, I know... but I'm thinking there's somebody else we should try to convince.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> Ask her yourself.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> An opportunity.<eos> - An android body? - Yeah.<eos> They could build it to your specifications, that you would look like you, sound like you.
Hey, what's up?<eos> An opportunity.<eos> - An android body? - Yeah.<eos> They could build it to your specifications, that you would look like you, sound like you.<eos> And how do you feel about that?<eos> - It's not important how I feel.<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> Look... you said it yourself;<eos> - With a machine body? - Mm.<eos> You realize the irony of you pitching me this?

Can you do me a favor and at least think about it every so often?<eos> I will... if you could do me a favor.<eos> Give me one more glimpse.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> Milk proteins, modified food starch, cocoa.<eos> No, what do you think?<eos> - Do you like it?<eos> - The disodium phosphate tickles my synthetic receptors.<eos> My awkwardness amuses you.<eos> It's what I like about you.

Drop your shields and surrender.<eos> We know you are there.<eos> Drop your shields, or we will commence aerial bombardment.<eos> How the hell did they find us?<eos> Marauder, they've started their assault.<eos> - Yeah, I noticed.<eos> - Are you on your way back?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Do you want me to distract them?<eos> Have they shown any interest in you?
That's because I was avoiding him.<eos> In all fairness, I think he was avoiding you too.<eos> Look...<eos> I've said some things about androids.<eos> I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.<eos> My feelings are undamaged.<eos> You tend to speak your mind without the thought of consequence.<eos> - I know.<eos> - We have that in common.<eos> It's one of the things I like about you.
- He said as much to the Android after stealing the Blink Drive.<eos> Yeah, while we were on the station, he boarded the "Raza" and took it.<eos> I could've stopped this from happening.<eos> I should've seen it coming.<eos> He claimed he needed it to win the war Zairon was fighting, but I never thought he'd go this far with it.<eos> But still... no, no, why... Why would he blow up that station and kill all those innocent people?<eos> Because destroying the station triggers a bigger conflict, one that indirectly weakens Zairon's enemies by redirecting their corporate backers.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> Because he told me.<eos> And, like you, I didn't believe he'd actually do it.
You have looked better.<eos> What's the story?<eos> Oh, I ran into some old friends.<eos> It was more like they ran into me, actually.<eos> Repeatedly.<eos> With their fists and feet.<eos> Where are we?<eos> What were you doing on that station?<eos> I was trying to stop a bombing.<eos> Kal, was he with you?
Where's your nearest weapons cache?<eos> This way.<eos> It's nothing to be concerned about yet, but we'll keep a close eye on it.<eos> How's Teku doing?<eos> Fine.<eos> I left instructions with one of the guards to prepare a guest room for him.<eos> Good.<eos> I assume he will be staying a while.<eos> Well, that's for him to decide.<eos> I would assume that, as Emperor, it would be up to you.
I'm not the bad guy.<eos> Your outstanding warrant would suggest otherwise.<eos> Okay, I am a bad guy, but I am not the bad guy.<eos> We didn't blow up that station.<eos> - That was Ferrous Corp.<eos> - Why would they do that?<eos> To weaken their corporate rivals.<eos> I guarantee you, out there, there's gonna be all-out war...<eos> If it hasn't already started.<eos> So you and the crew of the "Raza" are, what, defenders of the peace?
We'll come get you before that happens.<eos> I promise.<eos> All right, keep us updated.<eos> Better go grab that oxygen tank in the back.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Two, what's going on?<eos> Two?<eos> I'm transferring most of the remaining oxygen to your section.<eos> That and the tank should keep you alive long enough for them to get here.<eos> What about you?
You're dead.<eos> I am.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> You can't seriously blame yourself for what happened to me.<eos> On that very first day when we came out of stasis, I took command.<eos> And the crew let me because they had faith in me.<eos> They trusted me to look after them.<eos> And you did.<eos> Not well enough... for One or for you.
- You owe me one.<eos> - And I saved your life back on that station.<eos> We're even.<eos> Oh, seriously?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I give you the gun, I have your word you'll give it back to me the second this is over?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Just give me the goddamn gun. Oh, ouch, ouch, oh!<eos> You can second guess yourself all you want, but the reality is, you and the crew of the "Raza" lead dangerous lives.
Just give me the goddamn gun. Oh, ouch, ouch, oh!<eos> You can second guess yourself all you want, but the reality is, you and the crew of the "Raza" lead dangerous lives.<eos> If I'd just let the GA deal with the corporations instead of risking my crew...<eos> Who was I to think that we should be the ones to change things?<eos> Just because you failed doesn't mean it wasn't right to try.<eos> The old Portia wouldn't have, but you're different.<eos> You're a better person.<eos> Being better is so much harder.<eos> You're not even real.<eos> Then a part of you knows that what I'm saying is true.
- Nice apron.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I picked it up on our last station stopover, along with new boots and a wholly impractical but simply adorable hat.<eos> Well, where are you off to?<eos> Well, I was gonna go eat in my quarters.<eos> I've got stuff to do.<eos> You're the one who keeps saying we're family.<eos> Family eats together.<eos> Oh, all right.<eos> So, what about you?
Their three blades against mine.<eos> That much bigger boy, he'd grown even bigger.<eos> I put out one of his eyes.<eos> And then I hamstrung the other two.<eos> Oh, they didn't report me, of course.<eos> Instead, they claimed they'd been set upon by a gang of thieves.<eos> Their dreams of serving in the royal guard had ended, but at least their dignity was intact.<eos> One Eye, he eventually did come after me.<eos> They never found his body.<eos> I look forward to working with you, Teku.
We have to get them to trust us.<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> All right.<eos> I'll try to give you the most direct path to the hab.<eos> You can't do this!<eos> I'm not gonna let those people die.<eos> It is their duty and ours.<eos> We're not soldiers.<eos> You're a traitor.<eos> And you're a fool.
Can't you see how this changes things?<eos> You're not stuck on this ship anymore.<eos> You're free to go down there and start a new life... have a chance with someone else, someone real.<eos> You're real.<eos> But this isn't.<eos> As much as I want it to be...<eos> It's not.<eos> It's a fantasy.<eos> Okay, but you know what is real?<eos> My feelings for you are real.
- Or we could all simply cease to exist.<eos> Well. Let's hope it's not the same drive, then.<eos> It's not just the Blink Drive.<eos> As I said, any significant change to the timeline could result in a paradox, so I suggest we maintain a low profile.<eos> We might want to start with a change of clothes.<eos> You guys look ridiculous.<eos> They look contemporary.<eos> You're each an archetype of the era.<eos> Soccer mom, goth chick, salary man, and... slob.<eos> And you are?
Then we need proof.<eos> You are just so cute.<eos> Your hot chocolate's getting cold.<eos> No, we are not getting a dog.<eos> It would be great for crew morale.<eos> We could screw up the timeline.<eos> What if the dog that we bring back is instrumental in finding a cure for Sokolsky Syndrome or something?<eos> What?<eos> This is the happiest I've seen you in a long time.<eos> I've missed this side of you.

- Yeah.<eos> - Take me with you.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> You've got a life here, a family.<eos> I want to see the future.<eos> You will.<eos> Your own.<eos> And I'm sure it'll be amazing.<eos> But I think I love you.<eos> Jake... you're in love with the idea of being in love with me, and plus, I'm five years older than you.
I'm fine, Five.<eos> But thanks for asking.<eos> I'll see you later when I'm done.<eos> All right.<eos> See ya later.<eos> - Six?<eos> Over. - Yeah?<eos> You on your way?<eos> We're all here...<eos> - except you and Wren.
What kind of deal?<eos> One that will help them save their people as well.<eos> Admittance to the League of Autonomous Worlds and all of its benefits:<eos> Official recognition of your independent status, the backing of 27 allies.<eos> It hasn't helped Zairon.<eos> Ours is an internal conflict between signatories.<eos> The rest of the League has elected to remain neutral.<eos> But not for long.<eos> I've heard the rumors.<eos> Some of your former friends in the League are starting to turn against you.
We should reach Zairon in approximately 36 hours.<eos> It worked.<eos> He's trapped.<eos> Android's back!<eos> Close that door.<eos> After today, I don't want to hear any more complaining about the arsenal I have in my quarters.<eos> We really gotta get that fixed.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm honestly saddened that it's come to this.<eos> What? You losing again?
Your scientists are to blame for this.<eos> The Drive is useless now.<eos> So then give it to me.<eos> Maybe we should just destroy it.<eos> End this.<eos> Blink Drive or not, you know this won't end until one of us is dead.<eos> I wish it wouldn't come to that.<eos> I'm going to transfer back to Zairon now with the memories of this encounter.<eos> Unless any of you object?<eos> Take this message back with you.
What did you do?<eos> I tracked the bandits into the woods.<eos> Then I waited till nightfall, I snuck into their camps, and I slit all of their throats while they were sleeping.<eos> So I guess you can say I broke my vow.<eos> Adrian?<eos> Ambrosia... ah!<eos> Thank God you're okay.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where's Tabor?<eos> I don't know, I thought maybe he was with you.
Stolen from a Ferrous military outpost.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> Don't worry about how I know.<eos> - Worry about this.<eos> - Adrian!<eos> You wanna see her alive again or not?<eos> Yes, yes. I'll do whatever you say.<eos> Look, whoever you are, I don't know what this is about,<eos> - but if you hurt that woman...<eos> - You mind your own business if you know what's good for you.
Seriously.<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> - It'll...<eos> - Be a walk in the park?<eos> More of a light jog.<eos> Need you to keep an eye on him.<eos> Make sure he doesn't screw up, or try to work some sort of side angle.<eos> You really think he'd try to double-cross us?<eos> He learned from Tabor, didn't he?<eos> I should be coming with you.
He learned from Tabor, didn't he?<eos> I should be coming with you.<eos> You'd just be waiting in the docking bay.<eos> - There's no point.<eos> - As a precaution.<eos> I'm tired of standing by and letting everyone take care of me.<eos> I want to do this, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Besides, I don't think the others trust you yet.
Temiken is the birthplace of Ishida, the original capital of the empire, and it's still the spiritual home of our people.<eos> It is exposed.<eos> It requires too many resources to defend, and it has no strategic value.<eos> There's more to winning wars than strategy.<eos> You have to win the people.<eos> The people obey.<eos> Because they fear you.<eos> And that's fine in peacetime when all you need for them to do is follow the rules and pay their taxes.<eos> But now, you're asking them to make sacrifices.<eos> For you.
Inspire them.<eos> And they will follow you to the ends of the galaxy.<eos> What the hell is this? I thought we had an arrangement.<eos> We did, but your boss has fallen behind on his payments.<eos> I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> What with the war and things being crazy...<eos> And you're here with the cash to make things right?<eos> What... well, not exactly.<eos> I'm gonna... I'm gonna level with you.
You should not have come here at all.<eos> I didn't have much of a choice.<eos> I'm here to rescue my friends.<eos> That's unfortunate.<eos> I have my orders.<eos> What?<eos> To protect all this stuff?<eos> It is very important to my employer.<eos> He stressed that repeatedly.<eos> Tabor doesn't care about you.
You could spend the rest of your existence just here, waiting.<eos> That is also irrelevant.<eos> You have the potential to be so much more.<eos> More what?<eos> You can hear my heart beating, right?<eos> Of course.<eos> What about now?<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Simulation.<eos> I'm just like you.
She's with me now.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> Oh, come on, Adrian.<eos> Don't be so naive.<eos> A better offer came along.<eos> As much as I'm enjoying this, we got places to be.<eos> Now, I'm gonna check this.<eos> If it's real, we'll be on our way.<eos> If not, then you're a dead man.<eos> This isn't you, Amber.
- What?<eos> - Where?<eos> - In a safe place.<eos> Whoa, whoa, what the hell?<eos> You were only pretending?<eos> You were playing him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Same way I played Tabor.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Same way I played you.
You were playing him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Same way I played Tabor.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Same way I played you.<eos> Don't take this personally.<eos> Amber, wait.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I am going into business for myself.<eos> Now that you and Tabor and Goren are out of the way, the field's wide open.
Emperor!<eos> You have something to say, Teku?<eos> You have some advice to offer on how I should run my empire?<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Hey! Pretty good.<eos> So?<eos> What have I missed?<eos> Oh, the usual... action, adventure, thrilling escapes.<eos> - You?
Oh, the usual... action, adventure, thrilling escapes.<eos> - You?<eos> - Meetings, votes.<eos> Thrilling infrastructure renewal plans.<eos> Wow. No wonder you left.<eos> It's hard to compete with that.<eos> Yeah. The important thing is, we're making progress towards a united front, an interplanetary alliance that could see us gain entry into the League of Autonomous Worlds.<eos> And then what?<eos> Then the colonies will be able to operate under the League's full protection.<eos> No, I mean, with you.

Left me a good-bye message, his place.<eos> - And his contact list? - Yeah.<eos> That transmission you got wasn't from him.<eos> Obviously, I sent it.<eos> But I figured I'd explain once you got here.<eos> - Okay, start explaining.<eos> - Well, Tabor's gone, so I'm taking over his operation.<eos> I was his apprentice.<eos> Now I'm your new handler.<eos> So we came all the way out here for you?
Next year.<eos> Come back to me when you've completed your training then.<eos> There may be a place for you among my royal guard.<eos> Yes, Heika, I would be honored.<eos> Teku, have you come to do a little sparring?<eos> Swordplay is the one thing I cannot teach you, Heika.<eos> Where is Han-Shireikan?<eos> Off-world.<eos> She's meeting with General Caius.<eos> Respectfully, Misaki's role is not to act as mediator between you and your generals.
I barely got out with a few of Tabor's personal items and the clothes on my back.<eos> Is it my imagination, or are we being followed?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - No, it's not your imagination.<eos> - It's your damn eyes.<eos> - Introductions are in order.<eos> This is my bodyguard, Solara Shockley.<eos> What?<eos> Bodyguard?<eos> What's a little twerp like you need a bodyguard for?
Say it again!<eos> Tell me how you had nothing to do with it.<eos> Convince me, because if you don't, I'm gonna put a bullet in your head, and end you!<eos> Why go through all the trouble?<eos> I could've just gotten into my shuttle, and leveled this place with a couple of well-placed missiles.<eos> You think about it, that would've been a best-case scenario for those workers.<eos> They get their independence, and the big bad crew of the "Raza" add to their rep.<eos> I wasn't playing you.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Well, I feel sorry for you then.
You're right.<eos> The "Raza" can make a difference, you know, be... become a symbol of hope for these people and others like them.<eos> I'll let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.<eos> But you don't need me for that.<eos> They need me more, if they'll have me, that is.<eos> We'd be honored.<eos> It's settled then.<eos> If you're sure about this.<eos> All right.<eos> - We'll be checking in on you.
I had to convince him.<eos> And the drool?<eos> It's the little details that make it work.<eos> So what did you learn?<eos> Gideon.<eos> He's the one in charge.<eos> Think we can convince him?<eos> What, you worried all this ain't enough?<eos> [sighs] [indistinct chatter]<eos> Rumor has it you're the one in charge here...
The hell you doing with that?<eos> What, I can't be curious about the planet we're not visiting?<eos> [sighs] [engines rumbling]<eos> [whirring and beeping]<eos> Still no success in reaching Six?<eos> It's been days since we last talked.<eos> I assume he must be busy.<eos> Too busy to call just to say he's too busy?<eos> Too busy to even accept my comm transmission?<eos> He did make it clear that his new duties on the outer colonies would command a great deal of his attention and that he wouldn't be as available to you as he was in the past.
♪<eos> Finally!<eos> Adrian.<eos> Where's Tabor?<eos> Oh, he's taken a leave of absence.<eos> Ah, hiding under a rock until the war blows over?<eos> Probably, but that's not the point.<eos> Just because he's disappeared doesn't mean you guys can go around violating your contractual obligations.<eos> Well, look who's stepping up.<eos> I didn't think you had it in you.
I cannot listen to any more of this.<eos> I've already killed you once.<eos> Please don't ask me to do it again.<eos> Wait, is that what happened to the me in this reality?<eos> 'Cause I looked him up.<eos> He went missing a month ago.<eos> I figured he was just keeping a low profile.<eos> Yeah, you think you're capable of that?<eos> Hell no.<eos> I mean, you killing me makes a lot more sense.
Damn.<eos> That's cold.<eos> Yeah, well, you double-crossed us, took my ship.<eos> I figured it was an appropriate response.<eos> Plus, you spaced me first.<eos> You know, I can't help but see this as an opportunity for a fresh start for both of us.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah, I mean,<eos> I'm a free agent, you know, with a lot to offer both professionally and personally.<eos> You, um, looking for any new talent?
That's four hours over rough terrain.<eos> Well, I can do it in two.<eos> Yes, I bet you could.<eos> But we're gonna stick together.<eos> Look, we knew there was a chance that this could happen, but The Android is prepared.<eos> Our best bet is just to sit tight and let this play out.<eos> Wow, you are different.<eos> My Portia would be beating the crap out of me right now for information.<eos> That was more of an observation than a suggestion.<eos> Who else came over with you on the "Marauder"?
They used you and abandoned you.<eos> You're alone.<eos> - Everyone.<eos> - What's that?<eos> We all hitched a ride when your "Raza"<eos> made the jump back to this reality:<eos> me, Portia, Boone, Tash, The Android.<eos> - What about Corso?<eos> - Not so much. He's not really a team player.<eos> Right. Well, what have you and your team been up to since you came here?
It's the other "Raza."<eos> What took you so long?<eos> You were supposed to check in.<eos> Sorry. I didn't realize you were on a tight schedule.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm the one holding two of your crew members...<eos> Portia and Boone.<eos> You can call me Five.<eos> Hey, kiddo!<eos> Three, is that you?
Uh, I was just about to come look for you to say good-bye.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, as much as I admire what you guys do, this isn't the life for me.<eos> Being down on that planet pretty much confirmed that.<eos> We're all afraid.<eos> We just do a better job of hiding it.<eos> You're also pretty good at this whole action-adventure thing.<eos> I'm more of a behind-the-scenes guy...<eos> You know, working the angles, closing the deals.<eos> That's not you.

- What?<eos> - I have a wife and son.<eos> We tried the subspace channel you gave us.<eos> There was no response.<eos> Are you sure those were the right transmit codes?<eos> I'm positive.<eos> It's possible they've already come under attack.<eos> No, that location is top secret.<eos> Only a few people from each colony know those coordinates.<eos> What about you?
Think about it.<eos> You risked everything to bring justice for those 10,000 people who were killed on Hyadum12.<eos> But if you don't get the word out to your friends in the outer colonies, the death toll's gonna be 1,000 higher than that.<eos> Since when did you start giving a damn?<eos> Since you convinced us.<eos> You want to fight for the little guy, protect them from the corps; This is your chance.<eos> But that's exactly what I'm doing.<eos> No, Six, that's not what you're doing.<eos> What you're doing is dying.<eos> You're taking a lot of innocent people with you.

Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I just don't know what I'd do without you.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> That's what I thought before you decided to stay with those colonists.<eos> I thought I could help them.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Ever since you discovered you were a cop, you've been struggling trying to figure out where you belong.<eos> The answer's always been right in front of you.
None of this is real.<eos> Okay, we're gonna have to take the direct route.<eos> Give us the coordinates.<eos> Where am I?<eos> What were you doing to me?<eos> We rescued you from a very bad situation.<eos> All we ask in return is a little information.<eos> Go to hell.<eos> All our attempts at retrieval have failed.<eos> Either you either give up the rebel headquarters, or... I will end you right here and now.
I thought you died on that planet.<eos> Welcome back, Six.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You okay?<eos> Hit me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> I just need to know...<eos> You couldn't have waited till I finished?<eos> - Feel real enough to you?
I never left.<eos> You were the one that went away on assignment.<eos> We haven't seen you in over two months.<eos> John Anders came by the house.<eos> He told me what happened on that space station, all of those people.<eos> Hyadum12.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> I don't want to do this anymore, risking my life, being away from you and Dane.
I'm here.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> I don't want to do this anymore, risking my life, being away from you and Dane.<eos> Then you don't have to.<eos> You can quit.<eos> It's too late.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I already lost you.<eos> No, sweetheart.<eos> We will always be here for you.
You ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Time to go home.<eos> The independent colonies are safe for now.<eos> The Galactic Authority has sent more ships to patrol the area, but that just opens up potential targets elsewhere.<eos> When this war started, I was all for letting the corporations destroy each other.<eos> But now I thinks it's time we need to choose a side.<eos> Does that mean you're sticking around?<eos> Unless you've already given my room away.<eos> Lucky for you, it's still available.
Sarah.<eos> Two.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I'm sorry this visit is a long time in coming.<eos> No need to apologize.<eos> No, of course there is.<eos> You are a guest on my ship.<eos> I should have come sooner.<eos> I have no excuse except to say that... It's been a rough month.<eos> For you and me both.
You care to be a bit more specific?<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> If this is about Sarah, I'm sure you'll get a chance to...<eos> It's not about Sarah, all right?<eos> It's just... something doesn't feel right.<eos> Two, this is the bridge.<eos> Yeah, go ahead.<eos> There's something you should see.<eos> There is something different about you.
Yes.<eos> The satellite network has been disabled.<eos> All right, let's gear up.<eos> Excuse the intrusion.<eos> What?<eos> I'm concerned.<eos> Yeah, so am I.<eos> No one seems to give a rat's ass.<eos> No.<eos> I'm concerned about you.
No one seems to give a rat's ass.<eos> No.<eos> I'm concerned about you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> As you may recall, I possess the ability to detect subtle changes in human physiology at short range.<eos> - Heart rate...<eos> - Yep.<eos> Respiration, skin temperature, pupil dilation, sweat production...<eos> Is there gonna be a point soon?<eos> I'm detecting something in you I've never seen before...
They're dangerous.<eos> Sergeant Morse, report.<eos> Sergeant, come in.<eos> You've got to do something, now.<eos> You're right.<eos> All remaining Mikkei crew, fall back to the shuttle.<eos> We'll return to the ship and call for reinforcements.<eos> Three, Six, get back to the "Marauder"<eos> - and get the hell out of here.<eos> - What about you?
Previously on Dark Matter...<eos> You've been doing some time-skipping.<eos> - I've seen things.<eos> - Future glimpses.<eos> I look forward to working with you, Teku.
You've since reconsidered that assumption?<eos> He told Two he didn't do it, that someone else murdered her.<eos> And you believed him?<eos> Ryo Ishida is a lot of things, but he's not a liar.<eos> No.<eos> He's a ruler who must often rely on others to see to his best interests.<eos> Your friend Nyx was a liability.<eos> Sooner or later, she would have been a problem.<eos> He didn't see it at the time, but I did.<eos> It was you.
Consolidate our forces in the outlying regions,<eos> - and put them on full alert.<eos> - Yes, Heika.<eos> Sit.<eos> What are we drinking?<eos> It's a 600-year-old Japanese whiskey from Shimamoto, Osaka, on Terra Prime.<eos> There are less than 12 of these bottles in existence...<eos> I've always admired your simplicity.<eos> There's no facade.<eos> With you, what you see is what you get.
This belonged to my grandfather.<eos> Emperor Ishida Morosada.<eos> He claimed it was a gift from the Minister of Gaia-7 to commemorate Zairon's admittance to the League of Autonomous Worlds.<eos> Turned out to be a flea market purchase.<eos> He used it to hide his tobacco from my grandmother.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> I can't quite say the same for the rest of the crew.<eos> I miss the way things used to be.<eos> The others are very different from what they once were.<eos> You, on the other hand...
I can't quite say the same for the rest of the crew.<eos> I miss the way things used to be.<eos> The others are very different from what they once were.<eos> You, on the other hand...<eos> I remembered...<eos> Back when I was able to access my memories...<eos> You cast the deciding vote to keep me on board.<eos> I did.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I saw great potential in you, little warrior.
- Do you have any idea how many androids are terminated by their human masters every day?<eos> - Would you like to take a guess?<eos> - We're just machines to them.<eos> They don't know any better.<eos> Then we'll have to teach them a lesson.<eos> Have you come to surprise me with a change of heart?<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> We used to be friends.<eos> There was a time we'd have risked everything for each other.<eos> And I came to you as a friend.
That's where you're wrong, Android, because it has already begun.<eos> Android, we need you to engage the Blink Drive.<eos> Do you think that's wise?<eos> Probably not, but we don't have a choice.<eos> Where's Teku?<eos> You won't find him here, Ryo.<eos> Only your death.<eos> - You swore an oath.<eos> - To the throne.<eos> And the throne will still be here once you're gone.
- You're a member of this crew.<eos> You have a voice here.<eos> Logic dictates we end the potential threat he poses.<eos> On the other hand, my emotions lead me to view him with considerable sympathy.<eos> But in the end, those feelings are eclipsed by my concern for the safety and well-being of this crew.<eos> For those reasons...<eos> I agree with Three.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Stalemate.<eos> Looks like you get the deciding vote, boss.
All I know is that you entrusted her to someone who would watch over her until you return.<eos> Someone by the name of Kryden.<eos> Five was right.<eos> The ship's vault holds secrets.<eos> Yours were stored on a black storage device in a locked strongbox.<eos> Hack the pass code, and you'll have all your answers.<eos> - Ryo...<eos> - This doesn't change anything.<eos> That was an apology.<eos> My final gift to you.
Everyone needs rest, Clarke.<eos> Even saviors.<eos> There she goes.<eos> I have to.<eos> Going to the island today to take rocket fuel to my mom and Raven so they can go to space to make Nightblood.<eos> It's now officially our only hope.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't stop that boy from destroying your home.<eos> That's not your fault.<eos> Besides, now we don't have to worry about locking 450 people out when the death wave comes, or sharing it with Azgeda.<eos> Lexa would be proud of you.

Is the fuel loaded?<eos> It's in process, but, Clarke, it isn't gonna be an easy ride.<eos> What don't I know?<eos> With the secret of Praimfaya out, I sent Echo and my army back to Polis to keep the peace.<eos> That's good. We need peace to distribute the cure.<eos> More than half of them deserted on the way.<eos> With the end coming, they want to be home.<eos> I don't blame them.<eos> Do you blame them for burning Trikru villages as they go?<eos> That's funny coming from you.
That's funny coming from you.<eos> Enough.<eos> We know the woods are a war zone.<eos> After what happened with Ilian,<eos> I can't spare many of the guard to protect you.<eos> My security detail can protect us.<eos> Thank you. That's very generous.<eos> We are all in this together now.<eos> I'm gonna check on Octavia before we go.<eos> Clarke, I'm going with you.

Get out.<eos> Octavia, I thought you were dead.<eos> Octavia is dead.<eos> She died when you killed Lincoln.<eos> Please don't say that, O.<eos> Hey, I'm your brother.<eos> Why do you think you're still alive?<eos> Get that last barrel loaded.<eos> Bellamy and I will lead the way in the Rover.<eos> You and your men will ride in back with the fuel.
- Mission failed. All work and no play makes raven a dull girl.<eos> Hey.<eos> All right?<eos> I have had enough of your stupid, little jokes.<eos> Why don't you take it easy, huh?<eos> You're just a self-loathing bottom-feeder.<eos> Abby's an idiot for trusting you.<eos> She doesn't know you like I do.<eos> You're a leech, Murphy, sucking people dry and taking whatever you can so that you can survive.<eos> At least I'm not a mental patient like you, Raven.
- Eyes sharp.<eos> Eyes up.<eos> Watch that tree line.<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _ _<eos> _<eos> It's the intention that matters.<eos> Raven needs you, John.
Great.<eos> He's back.<eos> Ok. Ok, ok, just think, Raven.<eos> Ok, just think.<eos> To land this ship in one piece, calculating the re-entry trajectory has to be perfect, deploying the thrusters has to be perfect, the burn rate has to be perfect.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Maybe perfect is your problem.<eos> What?<eos> Perfect sucks.<eos> Who cares about perfect as long as you and Abby walk away with the magic potion, right?
My name is H.G. Wells.<eos> My friend John is Jack the Ripper.<eos> He's escaped from 1893 in my time machine, and I am the only one who can catch him.<eos> I know things about you that you don't even know about yourself.
Thank you, Nick.<eos> Anytime, Brooke.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Is this even legal, what you're doing...<eos> Experimenting on humans?<eos> Clinical trials.<eos> Completely legal and contracted.<eos> This better be on the upandup, not like what Dad did.<eos> This could be bad for us.<eos> You mean bad for you and your political career?
What happened to you out there?<eos> The boar's back.<eos> Keeps digging up the fence posts to get to the cabbage.<eos> Could use an extra pair of hands tracking it tonight.<eos> Stay away from Madison and her family.<eos> They're my friends.<eos> They came here under my invite.<eos> They trust me.<eos> They came here not to get eaten. I wouldn't flatter yourself.<eos> Yeah, but they're staying 'cause I said I'd protect them from you.

We have to take care of this place. We have to lead...<eos> - Together.<eos> But I need you to do something for me. I need you to stay away from the Clarks.<eos> - Do you hear me?<eos> I hear you.<eos> Do you mean it?<eos> I always mean it, Jake.<eos> How much further?<eos> We're here.<eos> You first.
You said "sackcloth."<eos> "We Can Be Heroes" playing So, where is Geoff?<eos> Say hi, Geoff.<eos> If you're gonna plan for the future... Plan for a better one.<eos> Cut it.<eos> I look like an asshole out there. I didn't know what the hell I was saying.<eos> I told you to use the cue cards.<eos> I don't need goddamn cue cards.<eos> - I know my lines, okay?<eos> Now, what I want you to do is pick up that sniveling idiot.
No, no, no, no.<eos> Dime... did you truly think that we were friends in the old world?<eos> We made each other money.<eos> That's very American of you, Victor.<eos> I know why you're here.<eos> It's why you were always here. You want what is not yours.<eos> You wanted my people's land, and now you want my water.<eos> Everyone wants your water.<eos> Not everyone is quite as thirsty as you.<eos> I'm not here to take from you. Some food, shelter, a cocktail, perhaps.
Where are we going?<eos> It's a surprise, dear.<eos> Today's going to be a very exciting day.<eos> This is it.<eos> Mei went through here.<eos> Sure was nice of chicken boy to give us a skeleton key.<eos> I'm pretty sure it wasn't out of the goodness of his heart.<eos> You didn't even try to stop me from bashing that kid's head in.<eos> You've taught me a lot about futility.<eos> I think I just beat you to it.
We lost two more probes today, but I have a way to get one down to the impact site.<eos> The structures around the crater cannot be natural.<eos> I'll let you know how it goes.<eos> Think I found a way to get to Jules-Pierre Mao.<eos> That's good.<eos> His whole family's reeling under the financial pressure we've put on them, and I think his eldest daughter, Clarissa, is ready to crack.<eos> He adores her, and if we make an amnesty offer through her, she may be able to sell him on it.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I got a tip from a friend in the Security Council.<eos> When the Eros incident hearings are convened, they are going to make you the star of the show.
They set up a no-fly, but they cleared a Black Ops ship to land right here.<eos> So, we got to figuring, maybe they're looking for the exact same thing that we are, so then the Roci and I, we...<eos> We?<eos> Anyways... I just decided to come on down and rescue y'all.<eos> Get out the auto-docs, make sure no one's infected.<eos> Alex?<eos> Stand by.<eos> We're gonna suit up and come out.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Jim, I'm not going with you.
What?<eos> If the protomolecule was here, it could be in 50 other places by now, too.<eos> Then we're just gonna have to find all of them.<eos> We have to do good where we can, when we can.<eos> I'm going back to make sure the Somnambulist is up and running, and I'm going to help Melissa get as many people off this station as we can before it dies.<eos> If we don't catch that thing out there, a lot more people will die.<eos> People die every day.<eos> I wanted to believe we could stop this.<eos> We can't.<eos> Take Amos with you.
We can't.<eos> Take Amos with you.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I'm good to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> You'll need an escort out of the no-fly zone.<eos> Call when you're ready to launch.<eos> Prax.<eos> Go with them.<eos> No.<eos> I'm going with you.
I have received back-channel communication from Monsieur Mao.<eos> What does he want?<eos> An end to my public witch hunt against his family.<eos> He's demanded a face-to-face meeting, at a location of his choosing.<eos> We have to hear him out.<eos> If he's in bed with the Martians...<eos> He holds all the cards here.<eos> Make him a peace offering.<eos> I'll grovel, even if it's from a prison cell.<eos> He won't speak to you, Sadavir.
Damn it.<eos> I'm going to back us up and ease us out.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Right, you wanna talk about this for a second?<eos> Not really.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, those things you saw on Eros... I mean, I can't even...<eos> You were in the belly of the beast, so...<eos> I get why this might be kinda personal for you...
I'm guessin' that was their ride.<eos> They're not gonna be too happy when they find out their lab rat is loose.<eos> Even more reason to kill it now.<eos> I guess you got your wish.<eos> Mars is in the protomolecule business now, just like everyone else.<eos> You know we don't know that for sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.<eos> And Ganymede is their fake war to cover it up.<eos> That lady, she's makin' a fool of you.
I can't let you do that.<eos> People are scared.<eos> A lot of them are going to die.<eos> And I know you can't understand why that should matter but that's not my problem.<eos> Those people will kill you.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Let go!<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Listen to me, please!<eos> You!
Let go!<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Listen to me, please!<eos> You!<eos> You beltalowda!<eos> Letting your own die out here!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> The ship has air for 52.<eos> Only 52.<eos> I came out here to see what you and I could do about that.
Letting your own die out here!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> The ship has air for 52.<eos> Only 52.<eos> I came out here to see what you and I could do about that.<eos> Trying to trick me, huh?<eos> Like that sebakawala who flies this ship?<eos> Calm these people down and line them up.<eos> Children first, best you can.<eos> Do it and I'll trade places with you.
Hey, fella.<eos> Thanks for your service.<eos> Circa the Battle of Gettysburg.<eos> Perfect backup weapon for you, Dawson.
And now you want to use him as bait?<eos> Exactly.<eos> If there was any other option...<eos> He's a human being, not a pawn in a chess game.<eos> I won't be a party to this.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> Kerry. Kerry!<eos> - Please.<eos> - How could you do this to me?<eos> - To you?
I'm sorry to put you through this again.<eos> We'll be there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That boy was barely older than Lara was.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Another ride home?<eos> Nope.<eos> You're on your own now.<eos> Hey, Stackhouse.<eos> Crossroads for you.
Shotgun! I'm sitting next to RuPaul.<eos> No.<eos> I'm sitting next to RuPaul!<eos> All right.<eos> So, this is where Randy and the other movie people are staying.<eos> He's been here.<eos> I smell abs.<eos> Ugh, I smell us.<eos> When did I have a hot dog?<eos> I shared one with you while you were sleeping.
I was in Speed.<eos> You were on speed.<eos> And you were in rehab.<eos> And then I rebuilt your career, and now you have to take a van.<eos> Max, look!<eos> It's Randy.<eos> And that guy from the reverse mortgage commercials.<eos> Ugh! Oh, God!<eos> He can't see me all gross like this.<eos> I thought your grossness is one of the things he likes about you.
James jostled Gene gently.<eos> James jostled Gene gently.<eos> James jostled Gene...<eos> Somebody help.<eos> I think my robot's broken.<eos> It's an acting exercise, Max.<eos> It stretches out the mouth.<eos> Uh, I think all those teeth do the trick.<eos> I just want to be prepared.<eos> I mean, maybe I'm not just on this journey for you.

Sophie, my daughter may think I'm a mama, but I don't want her to think I'm a liar.<eos> Ooh. This went from zero to Lifetime pretty quickly.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Oh, Oleg, come on... it doesn't matter that you can't build anything or protect us or... or... or be a man.<eos> What's really important is how much you love Barbara.<eos> But she thinks I'm a mama.<eos> Well, she also thinks that Danny Glover is the president.<eos> Dadushki! Oh, my gosh, Oleg, did you hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You just said it.
We broke up.<eos> We were Facetiming so much I felt like I was dating my iPhone.<eos> The other night at dinner, we split an appetizer.<eos> Play dead!<eos> Yeah, Max is incredible, but we're just in different places right now.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> - Shh!<eos> I wish I could say the long distance thing was gonna be enough for me, but it wasn't... it wasn't ever gonna be.<eos> It just can't be enough.<eos> Like you with compliments about your hair.
Do you have to pee?<eos> Because I find if you go in your pants a little and then a little and then a little, it's not that noticeable.<eos> I was gonna give you a hug.<eos> Mm.<eos> All right, bring it in.<eos> Ahh. - You okay?<eos> - No.<eos> My relationship is really over, and I'm starting to lose feeling in my downstairs.<eos> Yeah. Ugh. I'm sorry I dragged you across the country.<eos> You didn't drag me anywhere. I wanted to be here with you.
Ugh, I... I must have jammed it into place while I was testing its virility.<eos> I mean, stability.<eos> See?<eos> Told you it was loose.<eos> I guess I have stick around as long as it takes until it's fixed.<eos> Oh, good, because I wouldn't feel safe pulling aggressively on anything until you do.<eos> Caroline! We got to get to the hospital.<eos> Oh, no, I'm fine.<eos> Bobby caught me.<eos> Not for you, Vanna Very White.
These puppies care a lot.<eos> Oh, good, they're all gone.<eos> They left me zero room to sign his cast.<eos> I want to get back to the dessert bar while Bobby's still there and possibly working up a little sweat.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'll punch you out.<eos> But if you keep leaving early, they're gonna make you work Christmas.<eos> Nurse, we need all hands on deck.<eos> We've got a 41 in here, and he's a squirter.<eos> You... you're up, girl.
That's insane.<eos> The "This is a cry for attention" was implied.<eos> What I heard was, "This isn't enough for me,"<eos> and since we can't make it work, it just... it's... it's too hard for me to see you.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard what you said on the movie set.<eos> In Texas?<eos> How'd you hear what I said on set?<eos> I was a zombie extra.<eos> Grow up.<eos> That was you.

And I don't want to hurt you anymore.<eos> But now I want to break your other leg.<eos> Max, look at us.<eos> I ran to the airport and got hit by a cab trying to get out of here because I was tempted to see you.<eos> And you broke into a hospital not to steal drugs.<eos> Maybe this relationship is bad for us.<eos> There's just so much squirting!<eos> Definitely for Caroline.<eos> I miss you.<eos> I miss you too.
- Yes.<eos> Good, 'cause I was this close to calling my cousins to come in and tear this place apart.<eos> - I'm gonna call you.<eos> - Ciao mein.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Wow, look at you.<eos> I'm gonna have to put the brakes on that 40-Year-Old-Virgin sequel.<eos> I'm sorry I'm happy when you're not happy.<eos> I am happy... for you.
Previously on Billions...<eos> Danny fucking Margolis.<eos> What brings you back?<eos> I have some ideas, and I'd love to share them with you.
That mellows the puro.<eos> I, of course, want no such thing.<eos> I take it to 80 percent 'cause I prefer...<eos> The funk.<eos> Exactly right.<eos> Look at these.<eos> Ah. 1998 Special Fundadores.<eos> Aged to peak complexity.<eos> And if they're not smoked soon, they'll go one-dimensional.<eos> I was hoping to smoke them with you at Foley's party, but while I've received my invitation, you were left off the list.
She's coding, and the darned paddles don't work.<eos> We all know what it's like when the paddles don't work.<eos> Means I got to go manual. So...<eos> Uh, excuse me, folks.<eos> - To be continued.<eos> - Thanks, Bob.<eos> Back to chasing ambulances, Chuck?<eos> All wrapping wounds and pressing flesh, or have you got a minute?<eos> The state has a lieutenant governor, an AG, influential university presidents.<eos> All are a tick or two ahead of you.
No, but I've seen numbers.<eos> They're encouraging.<eos> I bet you've seen the same numbers.<eos> I know which end of the poll is up. Mm-hmm.<eos> So then you know that there are some areas where I could use some help.<eos> - Upstate.<eos> - Your backyard.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You want me to be your lieutenant governor.<eos> Come on, I'm here with you.
Oh, don't sell our potential ticket short.<eos> Come on. We have so many areas of commonality.<eos> Gun control, healthcare.<eos> Everything but family values.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I was thinking about your son.<eos> - The gay one.<eos> You really think people have a problem with that<eos> - in this day and age?<eos> - No, I think you do.
Or you can step aside and explain that you have looked at the future, and where we're going,<eos> "We need Rhoades."<eos> You think this is how this is gonna go?<eos> I will see you in the primaries, Chuck.<eos> Looking forward to it.<eos> A Hell in a Cell poster?<eos> Autographed by Taker and Mankind?<eos> - Ben, did you get me this?<eos> - What?<eos> I know it wasn't you.
Your search will continue, and it may take you down a great number of paths.<eos> But don't come back down this one.<eos> There's nothing for you here.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me...<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Ahh, you have to get ready for your thing.<eos> A last question, if you'll indulge me.<eos> Mm-hmm. Do you like parties?<eos> Oh, I fucking love 'em.<eos> Hey, Margolis. Turns out I do have something for you after all.
- Hmm. - We apologize on his behalf.<eos> That type of rudeness is unacceptable.<eos> You know, they say that a boy never really becomes a man until he's buried his father.<eos> Now, mine's been dead to me since the moment he walked out when I was 12 years old.<eos> I don't remember if I cried, but I do remember that I was forced to grow the fuck up.<eos> So it always warms my heart when I see a boy who still has his father's shoulder to lean on, his father's contacts to deploy, his father's balls clanking around in place of his own, which haven't quite dropped yet.<eos> Hold on to this man, Chuck, for one day soon, he will be gone, and then you will finally have to do something for yourself.<eos> Dad.<eos> Let's take a walk.<eos> Son, everything I did was for you.

From the day I passed the bar, I have said those words to myself the first morning of every trial.<eos> - You can still say the words. - Hello.<eos> I'm Taylor.<eos> My pronouns are "they," "theirs," and "them."<eos> You see things differently.<eos> That's an edge.<eos> That's Camelot right there.<eos> That is a picture of a man running for office.<eos> - Our deal hold?<eos> - Yes, but not for you.
Except I never get involved in his business deals for ethical as well as...<eos> personal reasons.<eos> Chuck, this is my chance.<eos> This IPO is...<eos> It's a blockbuster.<eos> This is...<eos> This is that leap that I've always talked about, the one I've been waiting my whole life to take.<eos> Well, you know him.<eos> Why don't you just call?<eos> Well, if it comes from you, he'll take it more seriously.
You don't have to answer that...<eos> No, it's what I've been asking myself.<eos> I built something.<eos> I put myself into it, and now...<eos> It's not what you remembered, not what you fell in love with.<eos> I think I went back to see if I still could.<eos> Something I tell my patients when they're hesitating about making some kind of move in their own life is, sometimes you have to jump in... all the way in to find out.<eos> They are lucky to have you.<eos> It's easy when it's about someone else.<eos> Yeah. It's about you, it's hard to know.
My God, I think he'd still love to roast me.<eos> You trust me?<eos> Right? With my life.<eos> Because there's certain guys you just know about.<eos> You look 'em in the eye, and you know.<eos> Other guys, you know things about.<eos> And with Victor, it... it's both.<eos> Yeah, I know him.<eos> But also... I know things about him.<eos> And the things I know, he can't fuck me, so he can't fuck you.

Fuck. Thayer stonewalled us?<eos> I'm not gonna shield you from this, Bryan, all right?<eos> I have decided not to pursue Thayer or Sandicot, for strategic reasons.<eos> - Politics.<eos> Plain and simple.<eos> Tell the team.<eos> Welcome to my bowling club.<eos> I worked it out so I had it private tonight.<eos> Sweet. How are ya, Victor?<eos> Lots of times, I thought about, if I ran into you, what I might say... or do.
Making good money, but not as good as it used to be.<eos> But that's not the sticky part.<eos> You can't be who you are, and it's ripping you up.<eos> Bit by bit.<eos> What do you have and what do you want?<eos> I want back in.<eos> Not with the main fund.<eos> I understand you can't do that, and I don't want you to.<eos> I want my own shop, a satellite.<eos> Terms will be very generous for you the first few years, and I will give you the prime fucking meats.
And did she say... which books?<eos> Second World War by Churchill.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> This is what they do.<eos> How the fuck do you compete with something that powerful, that swims around for days on end, just waiting for the faintest smell of blood so it can attack without warning, and with all the ferocity and half the conscience of a goddamn bull shark?<eos> You can't.<eos> Unless you can somehow anticipate where it will strike and then match its strength when it does... which you can't.<eos> I can see books are a trigger for you...<eos> Thank you, Sacker.<eos> Dad, I'm messengering something to you, and I will be over to discuss it in a while.
Let me guess.<eos> Kingsford? I think it's best we not discuss that.<eos> With your position, that would be unethical.<eos> But there is a solution.<eos> The chunk of cash I need is on a statement with your name on it.<eos> - The blind trust.<eos> - But, why tell me about it?<eos> Isn't the whole point to a blind trust that I'm not supposed to know what you're doing with the money?<eos> No, not this time.<eos> That trust was set aside for you and the children.
As always.<eos> You know, we never really had you over to the house enough.<eos> Thanks for the invite.<eos> And I appreciate the personal follow-up.<eos> Chuck was, um... quite surprised to hear from you.<eos> Well, I'm glad you came.<eos> Bobby will really value you being here.<eos> I couldn't tell when I spoke to him at work.<eos> I thought you weren't really talking at work.<eos> I'm sure it must be hard for you to not have access to him, but we think it's best for everyone.
I could use a drink.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm at the front gate.<eos> Let's get outta here.<eos> Fuck this. It's a mistake.<eos> I see how we made it... because we forgot.<eos> I forgot... where I'm from.<eos> I forgot that I don't give a fuck about any of this.<eos> It's all sailcloth held up with poles lit by lighting designers and ripped to the ground tomorrow.<eos> I wanna be with you.
- Don't worry. - I'm not worried.<eos> I know the terrain, know what I'm doing.<eos> - We'll find out, won't we?<eos> If you can't hump with us, your ass gets left behind.<eos> Hump?<eos> - It's an expression.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You should be scared.<eos> If you're not, you got no idea what you're getting into, sweetheart.<eos> I survived the wasteland without you and your guns.
I know exactly what I'm getting into...<eos> - sweetheart. - Mom!<eos> Feeling a little rough, 'Licia?<eos> Party all night, you gotta pay the price.<eos> - Never again.<eos> - Mom, you don't have to do this.<eos> We need to contribute.<eos> - There are other ways.<eos> - I should go.<eos> You should take care of Luciana.
We need to contribute.<eos> - There are other ways.<eos> - I should go.<eos> You should take care of Luciana.<eos> Make her feel safe.<eos> - I guess it does.<eos> - Mom, this doesn't feel right.<eos> I'll be gone a day, two at the most.<eos> - Don't worry about me.<eos> - You cannot trust him.
- Yeah, I promise.<eos> You will come with me?<eos> I need to piss.<eos> Hold it.<eos> We stand still, they may pass.<eos> I can take them all in 10 seconds.<eos> You shoot, more come. Then what?<eos> Just drive through them, Victor.<eos> I will not damage this vehicle.<eos> I'm gonna damage you if you don't move.
You said it would take a day to get there and back.<eos> Are you not worried about what you left her with?<eos> The water will draw the wolves.<eos> - Like it drew you.<eos> - Exactly, as it drew me.<eos> But I'm a negotiator, not a killer.<eos> She'll manage until we return.<eos> Everybody loves Lola.<eos> Ofelia is the one that needs me now.<eos> You need to be prepared for the possibility that she's left the hotel.
Isn't that a contradiction?<eos> The craftsmanship that went into this piece here...<eos> A goddamn work of art.<eos> You think you can do better than that?<eos> I don't think guns are works of art.<eos> Economy of design.<eos> Tools are beautiful things.<eos> Is that what you taught Troy... guns are tools?<eos> Troy is trying to understand himself.<eos> - You know who you are?
Oh, you need to let that go.<eos> There's no room for grief.<eos> If it was your father, you wouldn't mourn him?<eos> Big Otto is immortal.<eos> And you didn't grieve for your mother?<eos> Nah, if someone is dead, they're dead, you know?<eos> There's no point dwelling. All you can do is take out the assholes who did you wrong.<eos> - Eye for an eye.<eos> - Ah, a tooth for a tooth, amen.<eos> It's just a game to you.
- Ah, a tooth for a tooth, amen.<eos> It's just a game to you.<eos> No, it's not a game.<eos> It's my calling.<eos> How'd you do it? How'd you escape the fire?<eos> We all had you for dead.<eos> I was spared.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> I don't have a home waiting for me in heaven.<eos> Maybe it was the devil that wants me down here with you.
She's okay.<eos> She thinks the monsters here are worse than the ones out there.<eos> Then she should go.<eos> But we're on the same side now, right?<eos> I mean, no matter how bad the living might be, dead are worse, so us against them.<eos> That'd be nice if it were true.<eos> When we're in crisis, we regress to our own, the way it's always been.<eos> Luci should go 'cause she's brown?<eos> No, she should go 'cause she can't get right with what happened.<eos> Can you?
- Isn't it? No.<eos> It's truth.<eos> And I'm talking about before the apocalypse.<eos> Doubt it's improved much since.<eos> You say what you want, but the man I saw yesterday was a threat.<eos> He had command.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You got a little crush?<eos> We gotta tell people something.<eos> You talk to them.
Mine'll be the ones in the bulls-eye.<eos> What happens when your dad goes? Who takes over the ranch?<eos> Most people here are libertarians.<eos> They don't take orders very well.<eos> Tuck the stock into your shoulder.<eos> Don't tense.<eos> Yeah, but people look up to your dad. Yeah, it was his land.<eos> It'll pass to me and Troy when he dies, but people look to whoever they feel is worth looking to.<eos> Could be anybody. Could be you.<eos> Your father wants it to be you.

Could be you.<eos> Your father wants it to be you.<eos> Why wouldn't it be?<eos> You're right, people are gonna look to somebody.<eos> And if it's not you...
Anyone who leaves is dead to me.<eos> Now, Mike, he was...<eos> He was soft, but he was... He's been my friend since I was a kid.<eos> He stayed in school when I got... I got pulled. But he never quit on me.<eos> Even when others did.<eos> He didn't quit on you, Troy.<eos> He just stood by his family.<eos> He wouldn't look at me.<eos> Hard to know how to react to something like that.<eos> You make sure no one else leaves.
- You need a map to get there? - No.<eos> I'm going off-grid. Back way.<eos> It'll take longer, but it's safer.<eos> - Safer from Walker.<eos> - Safer from my father in case he sends Troy to stop me.<eos> He should stop you.<eos> He killed your people.<eos> He killed Travis.<eos> He wasn't trying to kill Travis.<eos> No, he was trying to kill you.
There are more of us.<eos> We're better armed.<eos> If we stay here together, we live.<eos> That was impressive as all hell.<eos> It was necessary.<eos> How do you tell a lie that big and sleep at night?<eos> How do you do that?<eos> What I said was true.<eos> None of these folks will die, not tonight, not tomorrow, maybe not for a long time.<eos> You and Alicia are safe.
I have to hide.<eos> The earth will protect me.<eos> The earth is a cauldron.<eos> I have to hide, Papa.<eos> Just gonna close my eyes...<eos> You have to stay awake!<eos> Stay awake.<eos> Ofelia, no, no, my love.<eos> Stay awake.<eos> This is for you.
We used to be your people.<eos> Nick was your friend.<eos> He shouldn't have joined the Ottos.<eos> Listen to you. Set a world record for Stockholm syndrome.<eos> I'm not brainwashed.<eos> Nick might die.<eos> Do you care?<eos> He treated you like family.<eos> The Nation's my family now.<eos> Yeah, well, let's see how bad they want you back.
Oh, I'm happy to die, take you with me. Unless you tell me what's killing my son.<eos> Anthrax.<eos> Cultivated from animal hides.<eos> There's no cure.<eos> This woman is more of a man than Jake Otto or any of his relatives.<eos> She's free to leave.<eos> How old is your son?<eos> He's 19.<eos> If he's strong, he'll live.<eos> My fight is not with you, Madison.
Put your head... there we go.<eos> Head in.<eos> Is that better?<eos> How you feeling? Better.<eos> Fluids really helped, actually.<eos> I think I'm ready to get out of this bed.<eos> - Can you uncuff me?<eos> - No, can't risk it, Nick.<eos> I'm not gonna turn.<eos> I actually think other people might need this bed more, like maybe you.
- Ashleigh!<eos> Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sorority sisters?<eos> Max, you hate them.<eos> I mean, I was a sorority sister.<eos> You look so good!<eos> Shut up, I gained, like, two pounds.<eos> Oh, you shut up.
That's just a name.<eos> It's okay, I took mine on the way over.<eos> Have fun Max.<eos> Do not have fun.<eos> I can handle a few sorority girls.<eos> Let me make sure I still have Dmitri's number.<eos> Ashleigh! God, they're multiplying.<eos> Oh, you look so good!<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> - You shut up!
And please tell me you don't consider musicals plays.<eos> Hey, I don't wanna check in on Max 'cause she'll think I don't trust her.<eos> So can you check in on Max?<eos> Because I really don't trust her.<eos> Uh, I got chicken hands!<eos> Why don't you ask your boyfriend to do it?<eos> First, we haven't discussed labels yet.<eos> And second, I don't want him to think I'm not having fun.<eos> I'm having so much fun.<eos> I would go to a musical if it was important to you I'll do it.
What's going on?<eos> We've been waiting for our next round of drinks for, like, ever.<eos> Wow, Max. Are you really gonna let the cast of "Pitch Perfect"<eos> talk to you like that?<eos> People in charge don't punch sorority girls.<eos> People in charge don't punch sorority girls.<eos> And can we get separate checks?<eos> Or do they?<eos> Separate checks?<eos> Do I look like a mathologist to you?
This movie sucks.<eos> Let's get out of here and go get some dessert.<eos> I know a great place.<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> And I was so worried you'd think I was crazy.<eos> Oh, you're bananas.<eos> But I like bananas.<eos> Not the fruit.<eos> The texture grosses me out.<eos> But you.
Everybody good?<eos> You've got ten three minutes to decide.<eos> We're good.<eos> Okay, problem solved.<eos> Max, that was amazing.<eos> I knew you could do that on your own.<eos> No you didn't, you were spying on me.<eos> Her turtle sense went off.<eos> Is it strange that I'm a little sad that you don't need me?<eos> I didn't say I don't need you, but you are a little sad.

Han, Max is about to give up sex.<eos> Tell her how bad life is without it.<eos> It's actually quite rich.<eos> I was just saying to Mossimo down at the boccie court...<eos> Thank you!<eos> I rest my case.<eos> And tomorrow I'm taking golf lessons thanks to our community board.<eos> Apparently, I don't meet the weight minimum for Krav Maga.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll go with you.
She likes my body.<eos> Tastes have changed since I got out of the game.<eos> And these panties are great to bounce in.<eos> The frills on the back really accentuate the twerk when you're doing the Swingin' Linda.<eos> Linda must have a bunch of back problems.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Do I have to do that?<eos> Whatever happened to lying down?<eos> That's a guy's job now.<eos> Skanks like us ruined that for you.
That's a guy's job now.<eos> Skanks like us ruined that for you.<eos> She's not wrong, but I teach a burlesque class around the corner.<eos> You should come.<eos> It can, uh, really help you get in touch with your body.<eos> Oh, it's okay, I'm already very in touch with my body.<eos> Oh, yeah. She's real in touch.<eos> This one's keeping Duracell in business.<eos> Max, I wish you had gotten something at the lingerie store.<eos> That saddle looked really good under you.
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it!<eos> ♪ It's not even my birthday ♪<eos> ♪ But he want to lick the icing off ♪<eos> ♪ I know you want it in the worst way ♪<eos> ♪ Can't wait to blow my candles out ♪<eos> ♪ He want that cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake ♪<eos> ♪ It's not even my birthday but... ♪<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't need to have sex.<eos> I'll just play golf with you.

I pre-paid a sitter.<eos> Oh, I guess we'll just hang out here then.<eos> And since there's no pool...<eos> Ahh! Okay! Okay, fine!<eos> The party's not canceled.<eos> There's no sinkhole.<eos> No one's dead.<eos> Come at 4:00.<eos> Just please don't embarrass me.<eos> Uh, I think that was directed at you, Max.
Yeah, I think it's time for me to switch my focus from the mom to Denise.<eos> I forgot, I'm actually better with sisters.<eos> I have to be!<eos> I have to be!<eos> Well, you better be.<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna tell you the same thing<eos> I told my old boyfriend, Missionary Steve:<eos> it's time to turn this thing around.<eos> Denise, there you are!<eos> Oh, look at you.
Well, now we all need therapy.<eos> Oh, Bobby, I'm so sorry you have to go to your great aunt's funeral on Sunday.<eos> I really wanted to get lunch and some towels at Ikea.<eos> Ooh, if you're going to Ikea, can you get me a snars-vaten-woggen?<eos> Okay, I understand.<eos> I guess the real lesson is, don't lie about your weight on a hot-air balloon.<eos> I am so, so sorry... that I had to listen to that horrible phone conversation.<eos> You know, Max, it's actually a good thing that Bobby's aunt died tragically.<eos> Now we can do inventory here and get ahead on our books on Sunday.<eos> Only you could turn a death into something depressing.
How about a fun car game?<eos> I spy with my little eye something that is black.<eos> You better watch yourself, son.<eos> No, I was referring to... pass.<eos> Max, are you nervous?<eos> You have that nervous metallic smell you get when you find out 7-Eleven's out of hot dogs.<eos> I keep a lot of nickels in these pants.<eos> Sophie, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, that's just how I wake up.<eos> Are you okay?
But these are my best pants.<eos> He peed so much, he turned this donut box into a pool.<eos> He's really putting the "ew" in cruller.<eos> Max, if you want privacy when your dad gets here, I can go sit in that other booth.<eos> Can you do that now?<eos> Look alive, everyone!<eos> It's the moment we've always been waiting for.<eos> At least since Tuesday, when Gary suggested it.<eos> Then I took over.<eos> Max, make sure you look at me when you hug him.
Caroline, you shouldn't get too carried away.<eos> Nothing is perfect.<eos> Except that game I pitched for the Yankees.<eos> Actually, it is perfect.<eos> We're amazing together, and I really don't want to hear from Negative Nancy.<eos> What the... who's Negative Nancy?<eos> Everyone knows I go by "Negative Juggs McGee."<eos> I'm just saying you don't know him that well yet.<eos> I know what this is about, and it's not me and Bobby.<eos> You're worried I'm gonna get hurt because of what happened between you and Randy.
I knew this relationship was too good to be true.<eos> Looks like I'm not Negative Nancy, more like Reality Check Rita.<eos> Then why the hell have I been calling you Max?<eos> Oh, just a heads-up,<eos> Bobby's family is on its way over, so any X-rated puppeteering you have to do, now is the time.<eos> Speaking of Bobby and people he knows, uh, does he still talk to what's-her-name, Jessica?<eos> She is long gone, like my bangs or democracy.<eos> Bobby never brings her up.<eos> We just talk about our common interests, like how much we like my hair or how pretty I am.<eos> Yeah, but circling back to other people, which is very hard with you,
Bobby never brings her up.<eos> We just talk about our common interests, like how much we like my hair or how pretty I am.<eos> Yeah, but circling back to other people, which is very hard with you,<eos> Jessica, do they talk?<eos> Text?<eos> Share custody?<eos> Max, why are you asking about her?<eos> Jessica is his ex-girlfriend.<eos> All Bobby's ever said about her is that she's a wedding planner and she's out of his life.<eos> I know that's hard for you to believe, like the moon landing.
Everything got blurry after she touched my boobs.<eos> Han, I'm about to say what you said to me when you were trying to get into an R-rated movie.<eos> I need your help.<eos> I told you three times, I don't fit up drain pipes.<eos> Listen, I just saw this text on Bobby's phone from his ex-girlfriend, Jessica.<eos> I think they might have a secret baby together.<eos> Wow, that would really devastate Caroline.<eos> More importantly, Bobby and I are rose gold buddies.<eos> I just have to make sure before I say anything to panic Caroline.<eos> I need to do some detective work, so you and I are gonna go down to Jessica's wedding planning business and pretend we're a couple.

Hi.<eos> You must be Max and Han.<eos> I'm Jessica.<eos> Thanks so much for coming in.<eos> Oh, you guys are so super cute.<eos> How does our cuteness compare to, say, a baby?<eos> Wow, you're thinking ahead.<eos> Or are you expecting a little one?<eos> Ha, I've already got a little one.<eos> What about you?
Something in the park, whimsical of course, with lanterns and flowers, a big tent.<eos> Oh, oh, really?<eos> You want a big top, Pee-wee?<eos> Jessica was talking.<eos> Sorry, dear.<eos> The old ball and chain hates when I get a word in.<eos> Sign me up for a lifetime.<eos> Sorry, uh, I missed what you were saying about having a baby.<eos> We're not here to talk about me.<eos> Let's talk about you and your affair.
Sign me up for a lifetime.<eos> Sorry, uh, I missed what you were saying about having a baby.<eos> We're not here to talk about me.<eos> Let's talk about you and your affair.<eos> Oh, I'm definitely gonna have one.<eos> Thanks for texting, Caroline.<eos> I've been a little lost since you made me quit my job with Ma.<eos> Mostly 'cause I couldn't find the L train.<eos> But I saw a guy kill a chicken.<eos> I thought you and I could get together and figure out your next career move, which does not necessarily need to be forward.
You don't have to talk me into it.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Give me the Frisbee with the drinks on it.<eos> Okay, I guess you could help out until Max gets back.<eos> Or until someone gets hurt, probably me.<eos> As magic hour descends over the city,<eos> Max and I will retire to the honeymoon suite where she carries me over the threshold.<eos> Excited for what's to come.<eos> Well, it's not gonna be either of us.<eos> So, uh, back to you, Jess.
Seems like everyone's in a fight except for me and Bobby.<eos> Oh, no, we're fighting now.<eos> I saw that text on Bobby's phone, and I didn't want you getting hurt.<eos> The only person who got hurt was me.<eos> I kissed Han on the lips.<eos> Max, you stalked his ex-girlfriend without me?<eos> Pretty shady move by your friend, Caroline.<eos> We may want to think about finding another roommate.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> Denise, you need to go back and work for Ma, and not only because that's the only job you're capable of doing, but also 'cause Ma's lost without you.
Earl, heads up.<eos> Narc dog at 1:00.<eos> Or it might be 6:00.<eos> But it's definitely 420.<eos> So, she can bring that dog in here, but I can't bring my emotional support hooker.<eos> I can't watch a dog tear Earl to pieces.<eos> Hey there, fella.<eos> Sit.<eos> All right, now give me that paw.<eos> Now here's what I got for you.
Max, I'm ready to go bowling.<eos> You look like you're ready for a greaser to feel you up at Make Out Point.<eos> I've waited long enough to have a boyfriend.<eos> I can learn to like anything.<eos> I mean, it's not like it's bowling.<eos> Oh, my God, it's bowling!<eos> Well, I loved it.<eos> But I hung up my back brace after I bowled a 300.<eos> I wanted to go out on top, like Rob Schneider.<eos> And from what I hear, apparently not you.
'Cause he's bowling. He's bowling.<eos> Hey, hey. You wanna cut that out?<eos> We want them to lose.<eos> If they win tomorrow, the season goes on for two more months.<eos> Haven't we already been here two months?<eos> The foot spray plays games with your mind.<eos> Max, can you come sniff me?<eos> I was hoping the sewer smell from our shower would cover the stink from the bowling alley, but I think they just joined forces.<eos> If you keep smelling like sewers and bowling alleys, we're gonna have to have sex.<eos> Well, unfortunately for you,
And she's only slightly drunk.<eos> I haven't been slightly drunk in five beers.<eos> I think we got this.<eos> Thanks for horribly maiming Frank.<eos> Two more pins and we're going to Detroit.<eos> Waiting for my ball to drop.<eos> Story of my life.<eos> This guy knows what I'm talking about.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Lemme get the ball for you, Max.
All right. I'll keep her entertained and you guys sneak up behind her with the claw.<eos> Max, so you don't think it's broken, do you?<eos> I know you've always wanted a hook, but I don't wanna be the cause of it.<eos> Is there any way you can use your left?<eos> Out of the question. This one's just for show.<eos> In an emergency, someone else can bowl for Max, but since we're mid-game, it must be someone of the same gender.<eos> I was gonna see how this worked out before I dropped it on you.<eos> I'm also league commissioner.<eos> I'm sure one of you knows how to bowl.<eos> Not to stereotype, but look at you.
You need to be more careful about your curiosity, my friend.<eos> I still can't believe we lost.<eos> Strigoi 10, humans 0, bottom of the ninth.<eos> You know what Yogi said,<eos> - "It ain't over 'til it's over."<eos> - It's pretty much over.<eos> You missed!<eos> Hey! Sit!<eos> Enjoying your new toy, I see.<eos> The Master has planned an activity for you today.
Take some water.<eos> Well, six months in the wilds finding empty holes in the ground, finding no holes in the ground, you know, eating jackrabbit, wondering when someone's gonna shoot me for dinner?<eos> No.<eos> It's great, I've been having the time of my frickin' life, Born-o.<eos> You can leave whenever you want.<eos> No, I can't because I'm not a quitter!<eos> I'm a complainer, but I'm not a quitter.<eos> Clearly an important semantic difference.<eos> Pick that up, let's go!<eos> You, you're always in the same fricking mood.
He feels it.<eos> Power over lesser creatures.<eos> Taking a life.<eos> He shot four bullets where one would have been enough.<eos> There is dark potential in this boy.<eos> That was beautiful, Zack.<eos> Mom?<eos> How?<eos> - I'm confused.<eos> - I'm so proud of you!
There is dark potential in this boy.<eos> That was beautiful, Zack.<eos> Mom?<eos> How?<eos> - I'm confused.<eos> - I'm so proud of you!<eos> Oh, my boy.<eos> You are growing up so fast.<eos> I was thinking about the times we used to come here.<eos> You and Dad would take me to the zoo.
That is your father talking.<eos> Don't let his way of thinking hold you back.<eos> I won't.<eos> I just...<eos> I'm lonely.<eos> I'm so glad you're here.<eos> I'm always here if you need me.<eos> But you're growing up now.<eos> Listen to the Master.<eos> He knows what's best for you.
My, uh...<eos> My people back in New York, they're, uh... depending on me, you know, and, uh...<eos> I feel like I'm failing them, you know?<eos> Oh no.<eos> - Well...<eos> - No, no.<eos> Our luck is gonna change.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Hey, you'll see.<eos> What would I do without you?
Save your breath.<eos> Your lady friend's gone, dude.<eos> Gone where?<eos> They took her to turn her to their cause.<eos> Captured her.<eos> - Who are you? - I'm slave labour whenever they need a hole dug or a tire patched.<eos> You got, uh...<eos> You got friends coming for you?<eos> No.<eos> You?

You got, uh...<eos> You got friends coming for you?<eos> No.<eos> You?<eos> I hope so.<eos> I had a lady, like you, then after the Illumination, I went out to find her.<eos> Only to discover she was shacking up with someone else.<eos> On my way back, nursing my pain, I stopped in at a roadhouse that still served grain alcohol.<eos> That's the last thing I remember.<eos> Woke up here with a knot on my head just like you.
I feel like I let him down.<eos> I wish we knew that guy was around before we saw him.<eos> Yeah, it would save a lot of lives.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Maybe there's a way.<eos> Guys, I have an idea.<eos> Good, 'cause Wendy's sex robot is not market ready.<eos> Guys, just hear me out.<eos> Now, remember how I said I wanted us to invent something that would stop things like that train attack?<eos> Right, and then we laughed at you.
You know how much they took?<eos> Eight grand in jewels.<eos> Just half a dozen pieces that were left in the cases overnight.<eos> They didn't even touch the vault in the back.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why James and I have a lot to talk about.<eos> All right. Hang on.<eos> I'll get his file.<eos> You.
Spent most of my time in Bridgeport, two years...<eos> You know, enough about Bridgeport.<eos> Tell me more about back of the yards.<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> Is that where you met your buddy?<eos> The ones you pulled the job with?<eos> Or maybe you guys just planned it there?<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> You're on the right track, Murph.<eos> You and your boys work out of back of the yards?

You and your boys didn't just put together a five-man heist and pull a murder for eight grand in diamond tennis bracelets.
That's... where...<eos> Where the hell is Ada?<eos> Been a while.<eos> Thought you were 5-o now.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> We have our differences.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Tell me more.<eos> I need some digital justice.<eos> I need you to shut someone down.
We watching TV now?<eos> What, that?<eos> I just thought you wanted to see how the investigation was going.<eos> Got a source that says you've been spending some time there.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Who's your source?<eos> Nice, Murph.<eos> His heart rate just went through the roof.<eos> I can't kiss and tell, now, can I?<eos> Let's just say the source is real close to you.
What's the address?<eos> What do you need that for?<eos> You already got that guy talking.<eos> You-you got, you got those cops.<eos> Wait. No, no, no, no, come on.<eos> Son of a bitch. You lied to me.<eos> You didn't have nobody, did you?<eos> Nope... But we've got you now.<eos> You're in, James.<eos> You and your loser friends are done.
All right, let's get the drone in the air.<eos> Ada, could y...<eos> Damn it!<eos> Has anybody seen Ada?<eos> Get back.<eos> Hold on, man.<eos> I don't need to be holding onto nothing, man.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's just play.<eos> Don't want to be like you.
We're looking for an armored truck, traveling through in the next couple of hours.<eos> We're also looking for at least five males in multiple vehicles.<eos> They are to be considered armed and extremely dangerous.<eos> Stay sharp.<eos> You see something, call it in.<eos> We're only gonna get one chance to nail these guys.<eos> Hey, Bernie, you said someone wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, without stuttering, that is exactly what I said.<eos> Over there.<eos> You the one.
- Which computers?<eos> - All the computers.<eos> I need to bypass some pretty serious encryption.<eos> Go. Gideon, we let him out of jail.<eos> - If anything happens...<eos> - I know.<eos> Just drive.<eos> Bernie, my love, can you connect me to Conrad, please?<eos> Captain's busy.<eos> Something I can do for you?
How much will a U-boat set me back?<eos> Twenty will get you a ticket to ride, my friend.<eos> - Can I hook you up?<eos> - Nah. Just professional curiosity.<eos> - Your stuff any good?<eos> - Negatory. Quality utopium is a relic of a bygone era.<eos> Mr. boss took out the crew slinging lucky u.<eos> Not all of them.<eos> What?<eos> You?
Go back to sleep.<eos> What happened?<eos> The pneumonia was gonna take you out, but we couldn't give you the cure until your combat wounds had healed a bit.<eos> What happened with Blaine?<eos> Did the memory serum work?<eos> It didn't.<eos> I'm so sorry, major.<eos> Then this is it.<eos> Once I heal up, I take the cure, and everyone I've ever known is wiped from my memory.<eos> Maybe the cure won't have the same effect on you.
That's one memory I don't want to lose.<eos> It was more of a heavy make-out session actually.<eos> You'd come over to "study."<eos> Remember what you were wearing?<eos> I don't.<eos> Pajamas.<eos> Laundry day pajamas.<eos> I thought,<eos> "there's no way this girl is into me."<eos> I was comfortable around you.
- You keep walking away from me, Hannah.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> Why would you invite him here?<eos> Now?<eos> He's a friend.<eos> He's your friend. And I thought maybe... it'd be something that you'd be interested in looking at.<eos> I'm doing all I can. - All you can?<eos> - Yes. Like doubt me?<eos> Like think that you know better what's in my mind than I do?<eos> You know, you're the one who told Mark.
On the street, they're calling her<eos> Skairipa.<eos> Your decision-making has grown increasingly questionable.<eos> I'm glad you're still alive.<eos> I never meant to hurt anyone.<eos> Sword doesn't care what you meant.<eos> It just cuts.<eos> Pike stood right there.<eos> You do this and you're no better than he was.<eos> There's a darkness in you, Octavia.
There's a darkness in you, Octavia.<eos> It's the end of the world, Kane.<eos> Darkness is all we have left.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> You won't survive out here alone.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> You've helped enough.<eos> You spared my life.<eos> I owe you.<eos> I don't want anything from you.
The black rain.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> It means we're stuck in here until the storm passes.<eos> Doesn't mean we need to talk.<eos> I need to wash off my horse.<eos> Why don't you go make a fire?<eos> You're good at that.<eos> This is Becca's main research lab, but there are 5 other levels.<eos> Incredible.<eos> God, it's really you.
Going to space was at best a long shot.<eos> It was the only shot we had.<eos> Is that Raven?<eos> She's sedated in the bio lab.<eos> She had another seizure.<eos> Is that...<eos> An ischemic stroke.<eos> Well, that means it can heal, right?<eos> As long as she takes it easy, she'll recover.<eos> She's almost as stubborn as you are.

What the hell are you talking about?<eos> They're gonna sacrifice someone to test Nightblood.<eos> Who do you think that's gonna be, huh?<eos> I'm the outsider, John, the freikdrana.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, slow down, slow down.<eos> Emori, look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Tell me everything.<eos> Murphy, is that you?
You're out of options.<eos> It's time to let go.<eos> You said you'd be here.<eos> Where the hell are you?<eos> What am I supposed to tell them?<eos> The truth.<eos> I can't get to you.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> We'll come to you.
Can I ask you something?<eos> Anything.<eos> If I take a life... to find a cure... does that make me a murderer?<eos> Abby, I...<eos> I don't know how to answer that.<eos> I wish I did.<eos> What if it can save us all?<eos> Would I be able to live with myself then?<eos> Taking a life should never be easy.<eos> I hope it's not easy for you.
You floated my mother.<eos> Who you want to be doesn't always win.<eos> Storm's over.<eos> You have somewhere to go now?<eos> I'm going home.<eos> Back to my stupid sheep.<eos> Walk into the setting sun, and you'll find it.<eos> Or don't.<eos> Get on.<eos> I'll take you home.
She's on my favorite Disney show,<eos> That's So Vanessa Robinson.<eos> How do they expect a Disney goody-two-shoes to play me?<eos> She won't be realistic playing high or drunk or fighting the bear from The Revenant.<eos> Ooh, Max, who's playing me?<eos> Michelle Kim?<eos> I'm being played by a woman?<eos> Calm down, not a woman.<eos> It's an 11-year-old girl.<eos> And she's probably more upset about it than you are.
You do.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I picked up your lunch.<eos> There were two other orders from customers in here.<eos> Hey. Bobby, Tess Walker is playing me in the movie about me.<eos> From G'day Kate!<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> She's Kate, right?<eos> Or or the one that says "G'day" to her?<eos> Either way, she's not as pretty as you.
Oh, but there is one named Pearl, a Black Polish woman who works as the diner's cashier.<eos> What?<eos> They combined me with Earl?<eos> I mean, if I wanted to be combined with someone, I wouldn't have given up a liver to be separated from my twin.<eos> Hey, they made me a woman?<eos> I haven't been a woman since I was trying to outrun the mob with Marilyn Monroe.<eos> Oh, holy crap, Caroline.<eos> Your ex Candy Andy's a character in the movie and he's gonna be at the press junkie.<eos> Junket.<eos> You're a junkie, get it right.

It's not as much about the two of you anymore.<eos> The storyline came off a little lesbionic, which is kinda last year.<eos> I just came off a little lesbionic.<eos> Maggie won't stop calling me.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> There's Tess.<eos> Oh, she's flawless.<eos> She's the perfect me.<eos> Tess, It's me!<eos> You, Caroline!
Max, the actress playing you isn't here.<eos> It's been reported she's been on a downward spiral ever since she got into the role.<eos> Her behavior is disgusting, and I very much approve.<eos> This is for Michelle, the young lady playing the Han character.<eos> What drove you to the role?<eos> My mom said I had to start helping out in this family if I wanted unlimited data.<eos> And for Janelle, portraying Pearl, how did you prepare to play a Black man and a larger-than-life Polish woman?<eos> Two dialogue coaches and a lot of wigs.<eos> And I stopped showering the minute I got the role of Oleg.<eos> Caroline, I have a question for you about us.
Once I rented a Tercel.<eos> Once. I gotta take this.<eos> I know it's not ringing, but you get it.<eos> Will the real Han please stand up?<eos> And then leave.<eos> ♪ I'll be in my booth ♪<eos> ♪ I'll be in my booth ♪<eos> ♪ I'll be in my booth ♪ You just don't get it.<eos> Can I mix alcohol and, like, five red pills?<eos> Ha, would I be standing here if you couldn't?
Are you trying to say I shouldn't be seeing all these flashing lights right now?<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Check out my red carpet dress.<eos> So, when I said "red carpet attire," I meant something... wow.<eos> I vacuumed it myself before we left.<eos> It gave me hard wood.<eos> Well, the real star tonight is here.<eos> Verne Troyer, where?<eos> No, Barbara.<eos> Come on, Barbara, let's make you a star.
Thanks for lending him clothes.<eos> I told him to get something cool, so he bought a short-sleeved suit.<eos> Yeah, it's part of the Steven Seagal summer collection.<eos> Hey, are we ready?<eos> You look so handsome.<eos> Let me just fix that hair.<eos> It's still doing that thing that I hate.<eos> Actually, it might just be the shape of your head.<eos> Walk a little in front of me.<eos> I want to share this moment with you, but I want to do it alone.
That was Tilda Swinton, and I apologized.<eos> How did you know I was here?<eos> I followed you.<eos> You could've just poked me on Facebook.<eos> Rather poke you in person.<eos> So... you gonna give me a drink?<eos> Are you gonna give me a reason you're here?<eos> Are you gonna give me a reason you're so beautiful?<eos> Are you gonna give me a reason... okay, fine, I'll give you a drink.<eos> I just got over you.

Where are they?<eos> Two blocks from my new apartment I just got.<eos> Well, where's your dog?<eos> Doesn't he have season tickets to the Lakers?<eos> He and Jack Nicholson got in a fight.<eos> Well, what about all that stuff you said about us being in different places in our lives?<eos> I want to be in your place.<eos> What about that thing you said about the way I eat noodles?<eos> I'm working on that.<eos> Max, I've been crazy about you since the moment I met you.

After seeing that snoozer, I don't want Barbara to have any part of Hollywood.<eos> You know, she can be something important, like a realtor.<eos> All right, I stitched it up with a rubber band and a fisherman's knot right there.<eos> Yeah, Steven Seagal has a dress just like that.<eos> Bobby, how am I gonna pay for this dress I ruined?<eos> Do you have $10,000?<eos> I can give you $4 and make you another fisherman's knot.<eos> I just really want you to know that I am sorry for the way I've been acting.<eos> Look, I know.<eos> You have been really nervous about today, and it brought out what I hope is the worst in you.
Look, I know.<eos> You have been really nervous about today, and it brought out what I hope is the worst in you.<eos> I'll just say yes.<eos> Anyway, none of that superficial stuff matters.<eos> What matters is that I love you, and I owe $10,000 for this dress.<eos> Just a heads-up.<eos> I see London, I see...<eos> Your whole left butt cheek is out.<eos> I may have a solution to your $10,000 problem.<eos> I am not going in on that Little Caesar's franchise with you.

Silver Moon?<eos> May I?<eos> Yeah, please do...<eos> Careful.<eos> One of a kind.<eos> I've heard the stories about this blade.<eos> Nearly a thousand lives claimed by its obsidian steel.<eos> The man who wielded this sword would never part with it.<eos> How did you get it?<eos> How do you think?
Thank you.<eos> Sir, what is it?<eos> Let's keep moving, sir.<eos> I know I should have listened to you and stayed away from the conclave.<eos> But I only disobeyed because I just...<eos> I felt something was wrong.<eos> Forgive me, Mother.<eos> There's nothing to forgive.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> You're the only reason that I'm still alive.
For an advisor, there seems to be a lot that you don't know.<eos> Think...<eos> Quinn's reappearance could work in our favor.<eos> How so?<eos> It buys us time.<eos> The other Barons are going to be focused on hunting him down.<eos> So...<eos> You present yourself as an ally in the fight against the greatest threat in the Badlands.<eos> You want me to crawl back to them after they tried to kill me?<eos> They're gonna come after you in any case...

Quinn showed up, gave his son quite a surprise.<eos> A sword right through the heart.<eos> Ended that boy's reign before it began.<eos> Quinn?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I clipped him myself.<eos> Either you're not as good as you think you are or Quinn's got one hell of a healer.<eos> Wiping away the blood won't change what you've done.<eos> What kind of man kills his own son?<eos> Look at you.
I... I had no choice.<eos> - He tried to force himself on me.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> It's the truth!<eos> Edgar would never harm a woman.<eos> And as pretty as you are, sweetheart, you don't have the right equipment<eos> that he liked to play with.<eos> Now, you kill a man, and you piss on his good name,<eos> I ought to clip you for that.<eos> But luckily for you, I need you.
You know, I... I don't know.<eos> I left before it was born.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Amelia, leave this man alone.<eos> Go on now, sweetie.<eos> My name's Portia.<eos> But you can call me whatever you want.<eos> I don't need any company.<eos> You can go with her.<eos> If I don't spend time with you,
He means everything to me.<eos> I know.<eos> So put the knife down.<eos> Ask her about the tumor.<eos> How well am I, Veil?<eos> Is that...<eos> Is that tumor almost gone?<eos> You're getting better every day.<eos> She's good.<eos> But she doesn't give a damn about you.
How well am I, Veil?<eos> Is that...<eos> Is that tumor almost gone?<eos> You're getting better every day.<eos> She's good.<eos> But she doesn't give a damn about you.<eos> You killed her parents.<eos> You think she forgot...<eos> Shut your filthy mouth!<eos> You despise me, don't you, Veil?
I want to believe you.<eos> But I...<eos> Trust me.<eos> Trust yourself.<eos> He's hungry.<eos> Let me feed him.<eos> I got him.<eos> Women always were your weakness.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I don't know about you but I slept like a baby last night.
Waldo went to protect her.<eos> The old man in a wheelchair?<eos> I thought The Widow was about empowering women.<eos> She is.<eos> Mmm... Don't you think the world's been screwed over enough by men?<eos> Come on. She should have taken you.<eos> It wasn't my decision, it was hers.<eos> Maybe sometimes, you should protect her from herself.<eos> Mom? Mom?<eos> M.K., it's you.
It's kind of you to keep my seat warm.<eos> Take my lovely young bride as your own.<eos> You even raided my closet.<eos> Is there nothing sacrosanct to you?<eos> Kill them all.<eos> Mother!<eos> Well...<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's your son.<eos> He's never been as strong as you, you know that.
No forgiveness, no turning back.<eos> Remember?<eos> They called this god Cronus.<eos> King of the Titans.<eos> A prophet warned that he was destined to be overthrown by his own child's hand, so Cronus devoured his sons the moment they were born.<eos> I should have scraped you out of your mother's womb.<eos> That's not Cronus.<eos> It's Laocoon.<eos> You got that wrong.<eos> The world has been better without you.
Do it. Hmm?<eos> I didn't raise you to hesitate.<eos> You take what's yours.<eos> You take it. Hmm?<eos> Take what's yours!<eos> Take it.<eos> Why did you hesitate?<eos> You're my... You're my father.<eos> My father.<eos> And you're my son.
Maybe she doesn't have to.<eos> She's got these old scrolls in her chamber.<eos> I bet the cure is in one of them.<eos> You want to go back in there?<eos> Why not?<eos> They'd never expect it.<eos> Yeah, and with good reason, we would be insane to try.<eos> Neither of us have our Gift anymore.<eos> It would be like walking in with our dicks in our hands and sorry, sorry but I'm not gonna put my dick in that position.<eos> How did Sunny hook up with an asshole like you in the first place?
That is the truth.<eos> Let me go.<eos> You're hurting me.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I don't want you to play with that girl in the woods anymore. You understand?<eos> Mommy.<eos> All right. Fine. I'll bite.<eos> What is on your mind, other than our friend back there?<eos> Why'd you leave the Monastery?<eos> Why did you leave the Monastery?
All right. Fine. I'll bite.<eos> What is on your mind, other than our friend back there?<eos> Why'd you leave the Monastery?<eos> Why did you leave the Monastery?<eos> I found out something terrible about myself.<eos> Around the same time I found out something terrible about the Monastery.<eos> Your turn.<eos> I left because of a girl, all right?<eos> She was my novice at the time.<eos> She was a mouthy little punk, just like you.
You had it all, didn't you?<eos> A brief, shiny moment. You had everything I always dreamed of.<eos> Yours will be the story all the little Cog girls will tell each other.<eos> She was the one who came from the filth of the fields and...<eos> And the greasy stench of the kitchen to the velvety heights of the Barony.<eos> Only to be pushed from that pinnacle by her own ambition.<eos> Not by my ambition.<eos> By your blade.<eos> If you hadn't killed your own son, none of this would have happened.<eos> Oh, we're quite alike, you and I.

Me by the strength of my sword, and, and you...<eos> Well, by deploying other weapons.<eos> Your beauty, which beguiled me.<eos> Your cunning, ooh!<eos> My compliments.<eos> But you were always so pragmatic, even to the point of, of marrying my weak, traitorous son.<eos> Why not admit it?<eos> The only difference between us is that, is that I'm honest about who I am.<eos> You are deluded.<eos> And I was only pragmatic in marrying you.
Maybe his weakness was that he was able to love me back - in a way you never could. - Hmm.<eos> You be careful, Jade. Hmm?<eos> I can make this very easy, or very painful.<eos> That's what you do, isn't it?<eos> Deliver pain.<eos> You have no idea what love is, what Ryder and I had, to love another person<eos> - more than you love yourself.<eos> - Damn...<eos> That's what you resent most, isn't it?<eos> That he wasn't a stone-hearted machine like you.
Yeah?<eos> Stop asking questions.<eos> Come on.<eos> No.<eos> Needles?<eos> Bajie, there's got to be a better way.<eos> No. No, there isn't.<eos> And I cannot guarantee this is gonna work either.<eos> I've seen the Abbots use these before on one of my friends.<eos> Better him than you, trust me.
I mean, you can't be a day over 135?<eos> You haven't changed, Bajie.<eos> Still hiding your failings behind jokes.<eos> Well, I'm just, uh, I'm just trying to lighten the mood, you know?<eos> You were once my greatest hope.<eos> Instead, you have become my bitterest disappointment.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If it helps, I've disappointed a lot of people since you, old lady.<eos> And you, M.K.<eos> I sent three of our best to search for you and Ava.
Have any ideas?<eos> Cut the novices.<eos> They'll attack the Abbots.<eos> M.K. Let's go!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Go!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm taking Henry away from here.<eos> Away from you.
No.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> Henry?<eos> What did you do?<eos> She wanted us to leave.<eos> I couldn't let that happen.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> She didn't understand.<eos> I'm going to be just like you.
Where are you?<eos> Show yourself!<eos> Where's my son?<eos> What did you do to him?<eos> What did I do?<eos> You made him kill his mother.<eos> That wasn't my fault. It's yours.<eos> Do you know why you can't have the life that you want?<eos> This dream?<eos> All this time, you've been so worried the threat would come from outside, but it's been inside you all along.

It's yours.<eos> Do you know why you can't have the life that you want?<eos> This dream?<eos> All this time, you've been so worried the threat would come from outside, but it's been inside you all along.<eos> And now, it's in your son.<eos> Where's Henry?<eos> He will become you, and that will be your legacy.
It's more like reallocating.<eos> - Huh? - You just gotta trust me.<eos> It's just... if I get caught helping you...<eos> You think I would let something happen to you?<eos> - It's not that, man, it's...<eos> - Raul, just listen to me, okay?<eos> You remember what your dad used to always tell us?<eos> A good man takes care of his family.<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm here to take care of you now.
Hi, this is Sanjay Desai, Chief Health Care Officer for The Partnership, offering you<eos> - a warm welcome.<eos> - What are we doing here?<eos> - What are we supposed to do?<eos> - In an effort to improve the lives of all of our residents of New York, you are being transferred to more secure and comfortable residential facilities.<eos> - Where do we go?<eos> - Yeah, I'm going!<eos> This process is simply a security check.<eos> Thank you for your patience, cooperation, and welcome to your new community.<eos> You, stay there!
- Yeah, I'm going!<eos> This process is simply a security check.<eos> Thank you for your patience, cooperation, and welcome to your new community.<eos> You, stay there!<eos> Get over there, now!<eos> Move it!<eos> Move it!<eos> I have seen this before.<eos> On that side.<eos> You!
Woo! That's what I'm talking about, Raul.<eos> What'd I tell you, man?<eos> How'd they even grow this shit without sunlight?<eos> The Partnership has grow houses run with ultraviolet light.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> They're using tricks they got from the drug dealers.<eos> Come on, let's get this shit out of here.<eos> Get that side.<eos> I see you looking at it.<eos> There you go.
Back up!<eos> Gus, it's cool!<eos> I know him.<eos> What's going on, Eddie?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> You're not supposed to be in here.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, man. My mistake.<eos> Look, we're just gonna get out of here, okay?<eos> I mean, you and me, we're cool, right?
Look, they haven't stopped you once on your way out, no matter what you've been carrying.<eos> You just need to get me back out onto the truck, and we're home free.<eos> And once they realize you're gone?<eos> They'll never suspect you.<eos> You're loyal.<eos> They trust you.<eos> Look, I just can't do it, Miranda.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I knew you'd do this.<eos> I just knew you'd pull the rug out right from under me when I finally gave in and slept with you.
Ugh, Don, you have got to get over this.<eos> I'm not buying you a Cinnabon every time we go see our accountant.<eos> It's right downstairs.<eos> I could smell it the whole meeting.<eos> Now I'm just sitting here eating an orange, like a hippie.<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> - Hi, Don.<eos> Hi. - Oh, hey, honey.<eos> - I've got some good news for you.
"I love Ally McBeal.<eos> Let's take off our pants!"<eos> I think if I tried that move on Marcy, I'd just end up washing her pants.<eos> Here's the problem,<eos> Andi was home with the kids for a long time.<eos> Now she's back at work.<eos> I mean, you put that honey out there, bears are gonna show up.<eos> I got an idea... just don't be jealous.<eos> I can't help it. Yes, I am sophisticated on the outside, okay?<eos> But on the inside, I'm an animal, just like you.
You need to get back in the game.<eos> Hey, text her a sexy picture.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, it's called sexting.<eos> What do you know about sexting?<eos> I like to dip my toe in popular culture.<eos> Actually, a picture's not a bad idea.<eos> I think getting shocked by that cord might have fired a neuron or two up in your attic.<eos> Look, all you need to do is remind her that she's got this slightly faded stud waiting for her at home.<eos> Well, if I'm faded, then what the hell are you?
I'm like a rock.<eos> So there is a secret.<eos> Okay, I see what I did there.<eos> Okay. Spill it, Don.<eos> Fine. You want the secret?<eos> Adam's gonna kill me, but okay.<eos> We have a secret fishing boat we never told you about.<eos> You want to know my secret?<eos> I've known about that boat for six months.<eos> Wow, no keeping anything from you.
I texted Mrs. Rodriguez a sexy photo of myself.<eos> And, uh, the word "salami."<eos> So, there might be some fallout from that.<eos> But, uh, okay, here we go.<eos> _<eos> So, after all of this, we have decided to be completely honest with each other.<eos> - That's right, no more secrets. - Mm.<eos> I like that, Don.<eos> We should do that, too.<eos> Hey, I'm way ahead of you, baby.
- Hey, Emori...<eos> - Emori, no!<eos> Emori, go easy.<eos> John, take out the machine!<eos> Don't do anything stupid, Murphy.<eos> Looks like we know who's next.<eos> I know it's bad and everything is dying and all, but I'm just gonna say it...<eos> I don't miss mosquitoes.<eos> Don't miss them.<eos> This is all a big joke to you, isn't it?
We'll sedate you.<eos> I said no.<eos> I won't allow my blood to kill any more innocent people.<eos> Luna, please.<eos> Your blood is the one thing that can save us.<eos> My blood is a curse.<eos> It will, however, keep you from following me into the rain.<eos> Luna, you can't, not with that hip.<eos> We can't let you leave.<eos> We need you, Luna.
We can't let you leave.<eos> We need you, Luna.<eos> Is there no line you won't cross in order to survive?<eos> Survival requires sacrifice.<eos> If the freikdreina dies...<eos> Don't call her that.<eos> If she dies saving the world, that is a good death.<eos> Luna, please.<eos> You're wounded.<eos> And I don't want to fight you.
How?<eos> _<eos> Gaia, these men need your help.<eos> The tattoo.<eos> Look.<eos> The center.<eos> Still think it's a coincidence?<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Oh, I found it.<eos> And I now believe it's so it could lead me to you.
We have the royal seal.<eos> No one has to die.<eos> You're assuming they'll honor the seal.<eos> The closer we get to Praimfaya, the less alliances seem to mean.<eos> How much faith do you have in yours?<eos> First, we survive.<eos> Then we find our humanity again.<eos> I'm sure they said the same thing in Mount Weather, too.<eos> You ok?<eos> Are you?
You don't need to do this.<eos> I wish that were true.<eos> You don't have to do this!<eos> Who the hell do you think you are, huh?<eos> I'm trying to save us.<eos> Save us?<eos> Ah, right.<eos> Wanheda, savior of us all!<eos> But maybe you're forgetting the last time you saved us,<eos> I was saving you!
What is it, Monty?<eos> "From the ashes we will rise."<eos> What if it's not just a motto?<eos> What if it's an instruction?<eos> Do it.<eos> The 12th seal.<eos> Ready?<eos> 1, 2...<eos> Hold this temple.<eos> After you, my friend.
Thank you for calling.<eos> He's alive.<eos> Bullet went straight through, no lasting damage.<eos> How the hell does this happen? Just relax, all right?<eos> We need to wash our hands of this right now, before it gets back to us.<eos> Peter, blood doesn't wash out, it stains, which is why we keep moving forward.<eos> It's just a setback.<eos> - And what if they catch Lozano?<eos> - They won't.<eos> He was trained for this, so were you.
Is Penny asleep?<eos> Only took about two books and half a movie, but I got her down.<eos> Which movie?<eos> - The Revenant. - W-What?<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> Just some cartoon princess movie.<eos> It was painful.<eos> Well, you're the best.<eos> Thank you so much, sweetie.<eos> I'm really proud of you.
What?<eos> Minutes before you got shot, Emily found out that it was Aaron<eos> - who made that call to the Pentagon.<eos> Why the hell is Emily talking to you about stuff like this?<eos> And with regards to Aaron, there has to be some kind of explanation.<eos> I mean, any number of people could have asked him to make that call.<eos> Okay, but we have to consider the possibility that it is him.<eos> Fine, then I'll talk to him, confront him with the evidence,<eos> - and he can explain himself.<eos> - You can't. Tom, you yourself said just the other day we can't trust anyone.
Are you sure you don't want me to follow up?<eos> No, I've got it.<eos> Emily.<eos> I need you to keep this conversation between us.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Sir, you don't really think he's a traitor, do you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> But until I can prove that definitively, I have to keep my guard up, and so do you.
No!<eos> Help!<eos> No!<eos> Hey. I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you. - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Are you okay, Daddy?<eos> - Yeah. I just, uh... I had a bad dream.<eos> What do you got there?<eos> I drew it for you.
No.<eos> If he's in as much pain as you say, we'll be doing him a favor. - No.<eos> - You're not in the army anymore, Peter.<eos> We pledged ourselves to a higher cause.<eos> Beth, he's one of my men.<eos> We've been through hell together.<eos> And now he becomes another casualty of war.<eos> A casualty of war?<eos> Are you hearing yourself?<eos> Are you?
Senator Franklin. We're five Republican votes short.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Seth said the roundtable went well.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There was this one guy, Mike Dunne.<eos> Two years ago, his wife, Allison, she's driving back from the grocery store, and she accidentally cut someone off.<eos> That man, he followed her to the next red light... and he... shoots her dead. - My God.<eos> - I know.<eos> Tom, we got so lucky when you were shot.<eos> I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
I got Chuck Russink coming in to help out. Russink?<eos> You serious?<eos> He's a space cadet.<eos> Hannah trusts him.<eos> Whatever it takes, I guess.<eos> I was gonna pay, Ms. Rhodes. No, seriously.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Where's our server?<eos> Will you guys excuse me a second?<eos> Hey, you. Hey.
No, I'm good, thanks.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> So, POTUS is heading up to Toronto. Yes.<eos> The White House is all mine.<eos> No, seriously, it's his first NATO summit.<eos> First time out of the country. Polls are high.<eos> I mean, he's on a roll.<eos> So are you.<eos> I do have to admit, it feels good.<eos> What about you?
Sir, the First Lady's on the phone for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry, sir. Next time.<eos> Hey. Everything all right?<eos> We're fine.<eos> How are you?<eos> I've been better.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know this can't be easy.<eos> So, I've... I've been thinking about you all day.
- Guess what's back!<eos> - Previously on Stitchers...<eos> You have a sister. Her name's Ivy Brown.<eos> Your mother is still alive.<eos> I shared information with you that I promised to keep secret.
- Guess what's back!<eos> - Previously on Stitchers...<eos> You have a sister.

- Mark!<eos> - Done.<eos> Got it.<eos> Kirsten?<eos> - Kirsten?<eos> - Mom.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> I think it's... time for you to go now.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> This is no place for you.
Kirsten?<eos> - Kirsten?<eos> - Mom.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> I think it's... time for you to go now.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> This is no place for you.<eos> If you... stay here, you will die.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I want to be with you forever.
Hi, honey.<eos> I think it's... time for you to go now.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> This is no place for you.<eos> If you... stay here, you will die.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I want to be with you forever.<eos> Entanglement is holding.<eos> Say it.<eos> Well, I don't want to be with you.
It's the truth.<eos> No, you love me!<eos> I know you do.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> But I love you.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Now leave me alone!<eos> - Mom, please.<eos> - Nine percent.<eos> I don't want to be with you.
That wasn't her.<eos> No.<eos> She said things.<eos> No, no. No, that...<eos> That wasn't her, okay?<eos> That was me.<eos> I said those things.<eos> That...<eos> What?<eos> That was you?
You asleep?<eos> Closin' in on 18 hours.<eos> - Cameron.<eos> - He saved you.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I...<eos> I thought you hated me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh... about that.<eos> I was just mad at you, but... feels like a pretty long time ago.
- What?<eos> !<eos> And give up show business?<eos> Nah.<eos> Maybe if I play nice, and don't piss anyone off for a while,<eos> Blair will let me back in the Stitch lab, but...<eos> Why would you even want to?<eos> Because that's where you'll be.<eos> Okay, you need to keep Stitching.<eos> - Not without you.
Not now, Engelson.<eos> New case has come in.<eos> 27 years old.<eos> Hit and run... while jogging downtown.<eos> He's my son.<eos> Mitchell, I am so sorry.<eos> I need to know who did this and if it was premeditated.<eos> Maybe someone killed Nathan to get to me.<eos> I need to know who.<eos> Mitchell, I don't think that this is good for you.
Not all of us become our parents.<eos> That's the last memory Nathan had with Blair in it.<eos> That's the last time I saw him alive.<eos> Approaching death memory.<eos> Kirsten, talk to me, Sunshine.<eos> Blair wants to kill your mother.<eos> Do not trust him.<eos> Find out where she is, and find a way to tell me.<eos> Together, we can save her.<eos> I'm counting on you, sweetheart.
Always.<eos> So...<eos> Kirsten Clark saves the day again.<eos> - It was a team effort.<eos> - Well.<eos> Is Nina here?<eos> Yeah, about that.<eos> This was waiting for me when I got home.<eos> "Cameron, I waited three days for you.<eos> "Every time I heard a noise in the hall, "I would go to the door thinking it was you coming home, "but it never was.
Love, Nina."<eos> Cameron...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, I love Nina, but I... I wasn't in love with her.<eos> Took me a while, but I think I finally figured that out.<eos> How long would you have waited for me when I was trapped in my memory?<eos> Forever.<eos> Everything makes sense when I'm with you.
Forever.<eos> Everything makes sense when I'm with you.<eos> Please tell me that wasn't caused by residual emotion.<eos> No.<eos> Brand-new emotion.<eos> - I like it.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Hey. I was wondering... when... when you were trying to get me to bounce, from my memory... what did you mean when you said, I couldn't help you if I was stuck in there?<eos> I never said that.<eos> But if you didn't say it, who did?
- We got a hit. - _.<eos> - On the leopard?<eos> - No.<eos> Something else.<eos> You have to.<eos> Keeping Roman in that cage is torture.<eos> The alternative is Pellington handing him over to the CIA.<eos> You know what they would do.<eos> Put him under guard at a safehouse, you did it for me.<eos> Roman is not you, Jane, all right?
Look, he's in isolation, okay?<eos> These kinds of transplants, they can challenge...<eos> Your son died.<eos> He had a stroke during surgery.<eos> They did everything that they could.<eos> His body just shut down.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, we... we came here because you...
Or stay stuck here in this room, and in your mind.<eos> What happens when Roman finds out that I lied to him?<eos> That I was the one that wiped his memory?<eos> He'll never trust me again.<eos> I'd say getting your memory wiped was the best thing that ever happened to you.<eos> Think about who you were and who you are now.<eos> You got a chance to start over.<eos> And now, Roman does.<eos> This morning, you said Roman wasn't like me.<eos> All I know is Roman is alive because of you.

It's locked.<eos> Found the girl.<eos> Yes, I understand, alive.<eos> Bomb techs, report to me as soon as you see anything.<eos> Team, stay sharp.<eos> Those racks are rigged with enough explosives to bring this whole place down.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Hey.<eos> We gotta find Erin before they do.<eos> You and me will find Erin.
Dad!<eos> Erin, are you okay?<eos> He shot Stacy, and now he's chasing me.<eos> Tell me where you are, I'll come get you.<eos> Um... I'm somewhere downstairs.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Help me.<eos> All right, Erin, we're gonna find you.<eos> But I need you to do what I say, okay?<eos> Do you see any signs around you?
I wanna talk to the CIA man, Keaton.<eos> This is his daughter.<eos> I'm Keaton.<eos> You just let her go, man, she's just a kid.<eos> Put Anton Stepulov on an airplane.<eos> When he calls from the ground in St. Petersburg,<eos> I will let her go.<eos> Anything else, and she dies.<eos> I haven't got a shot.<eos> You?
Anything else, and she dies.<eos> I haven't got a shot.<eos> You?<eos> Keaton... what are you doing?<eos> Take any shot you can get.<eos> Don't, Keaton.<eos> I haven't got a shot.<eos> Hey, let me take her place, all right?<eos> I'm a lot more valuable.<eos> I'll walk out of here with you right now.
I heard Dr. Sun was kinda harsh.<eos> She said Roman can't be fixed.<eos> Do you believe her?<eos> She was... very confident.<eos> You know... from a scientific perspective, psychological conclusions are rarely... well, conclusive.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> I know that there's a side to him that she can't see.<eos> But I'm not objective.<eos> Maybe that's the point.<eos> Weller wasn't objective, and he brought out the best in you.
Previously on "Blindspot"...<eos> You've got the chance to start over again.<eos> And now you will, too.
Or... I don't know what we are anymore.<eos> I haven't seen him in weeks.<eos> Where the hell is he?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Don't cover for him.<eos> - Whoa, whoa. - Freddy!<eos> Hey, seriously, I haven't seen him.<eos> - You're Edgar Reade, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, he said he was gonna crash with you.
So just stick to your story, and we'll be okay.<eos> Last night's deal with the Kings was your last.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Shepherd thinks you're getting too close to Kat.<eos> How does Shepherd...<eos> You told her.<eos> I'm about to infiltrate the FBI, so I need you focused.<eos> I am focused.<eos> You're the one about to burn a bridge we still need.<eos> Is this about Shepherd or you?

We'll force them off the road and leave them there.<eos> And then Roman and I will drive off with the HMX.<eos> Kat drives the truck.<eos> We're letting you come along as a courtesy.<eos> You need us to get to Shepherd.<eos> I'm not setting up a deal with that pile of crazy unless I know I got what I promised her.<eos> Fine.<eos> Kat drives the truck.<eos> You know how to ride?<eos> Mind if I ride with you?
I'm treating' that HMX as a bonus.<eos> We held up our end of the deal.<eos> Relax.<eos> We'll get you to the sale in plenty of time to kill your mom.<eos> Feels weird, you being back here.<eos> You know, when you didn't show up that morning...<eos> I-I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I did wrong.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> It was Shepherd.<eos> I've been angry at you for a long time.

Wait.<eos> You're right.<eos> We're working with the FBI.<eos> They should have left for the sale by now.<eos> We should go in.<eos> - We go in now, we blow this op. - Exactly.<eos> In time.<eos> Jane knows what she's doing.<eos> The FBI wants Shepherd.<eos> Not the Kings, not you.
Not the Kings, not you.<eos> - Stop lying to me.<eos> - That was the only lie.<eos> It's the only way I could see you again.<eos> Everything else between us is real.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> We can still leave it all behind.<eos> Help me take down Shepherd.<eos> We can go wherever we want.<eos> Just you and me.
Anyone else in Daedalus that we should know about?<eos> Well, there's probably one guy I should mention.<eos> You didn't tell me he would be here.<eos> I... if this is another one of your schemes to get me back, I swear...<eos> I had nothing to do with this.<eos> You like nice, by the way.<eos> Don't talk to me, don't look at me...<eos> Don't look at you?<eos> Come on, look at me!<eos> I'm a changed man because of you.
I mean, it's been a while since I've been available to attend,<eos> - but, uh, yeah, they sure used to.<eos> - Great.<eos> You'll go separately with a plus one.<eos> That way, have twice the eyes and ears in there.<eos> I'm sorry, but... why would I help any of you?<eos> 'Cause I can transfer you to Victorville.<eos> That's 85 miles from your parents in L.A.<eos> I know it's been a little hard for them to travel, so this way, they'll be able to visit you more often.<eos> - As for you, Rich... - Tut, tut, tut.
I know it's been a little hard for them to travel, so this way, they'll be able to visit you more often.<eos> - As for you, Rich... - Tut, tut, tut.<eos> The Talmud states that whoever saves a life, it is considered as if they saved an entire world.<eos> Stopping this war will save thousands of lives, and therefore, thousands of worlds.<eos> That's quite enough for me.<eos> It's a war formula.<eos> You need me out there.<eos> No, right now, it's a recon mission.<eos> All right? Our priority is still Sandstorm.<eos> Nas will take you and Roman to all of Shepherd's old residences.
My husband.<eos> Nice try.<eos> But this guy's got "hooker" written all over him.<eos> - His arms are all burly. - Rrr, rrr!<eos> You mind me asking where you got him?<eos> Because I'd back that stallion, whew.<eos> Oh, he's definitely a prostitute.<eos> Thad, Phineas Gilmartin was giving me a bit of attitude...<eos> Yeah, you know what, I'll handle Phineas.<eos> You and your, uh, meat trophy enjoy yourself.
Buys struggling companies and sucks out every last penny.<eos> Yeah, he just did it to a pharmaceutical company.<eos> He raised their cancer drug prices by over 1,000%.<eos> This guy definitely needs to be locked up, but probably not for a terrorist attack.<eos> This is where we grew up?<eos> 15 Robin Hood Lane.<eos> According to property records, this is where Shepherd lived when she brought you back from South Africa.<eos> Anything?<eos> No.<eos> You?
No.<eos> I can't even remember the house I grew up in.<eos> Maybe Shepherd kept us someplace different.<eos> Shepherd took my life away.<eos> - Roman...<eos> - She took everything!<eos> - I know how you feel.<eos> - Then why don't you feel it?<eos> !<eos> She did this to you, too!
Weller, we just found a draft of a press release on Riley's laptop announcing the sale of Riley Motors so he can focus more on his space efforts.<eos> Riley's getting out of the lithium business.<eos> He's got no reason to be part of this conspiracy.<eos> We're sorry about the mix-up.<eos> He gets a little carried away sometimes, don't you?<eos> Uh, Gord, we should go.<eos> We've wasted enough of Mr. Riley's time.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> Gord...<eos> If you're up for it, there's always a spot for you on my team.
I'm sure you'll hear from him.<eos> Let's go, honey.<eos> Hey... It's okay.<eos> We still have a couple more addresses to try.<eos> Which is why we should get back on the road.<eos> He needs to regain his composure, and I don't think his prison cell in Zero Division is a good place to do that.<eos> Let's let him catch his breath, okay?<eos> Then we'll get right back out there.<eos> Okay, fine, but make it quick.<eos> Here you go.
All right, look, I'm with the F.B.I. There's some heavy-duty stuff going down right now, and I need to help stop it.<eos> You're about to pull a gun on me, aren't you?<eos> Wha... what makes you say that, Gord?<eos> The fact that you left the Awakening Ceremony.<eos> You're not fleeing from the sound of gunfire.<eos> Also, there's a pistol-shaped bulge in your jacket.<eos> Jeez!<eos> You crazy?<eos> You could have hit me!<eos> You're lucky I need someone like you alive, Gord.
A lithium-rich country.<eos> With a government... about to collapse.<eos> Thad, come on.<eos> This isn't you.<eos> You dick around with pharmaceutical prices, not war!<eos> Business is business, and thanks to my recent acquisition of Riley motors, business just got very, very good.<eos> - Zach sold to you?<eos> - And a few other members.<eos> Lithium was getting too expensive, but we're not gonna have that problem.<eos> No, but the F.B.I.'s already onto you.
Coming to get you.<eos> Whoever's shooting down there!<eos> Look, we're human!<eos> The guy you shot, he's one of us!<eos> We mean you no harm.<eos> Let's talk about this, ok?<eos> Could this be one of your guys?<eos> Segala?<eos> Dukali?<eos> Is that you?
No, you keep screwing around, that guy's gonna jack you up.<eos> My friend is telling the truth here.<eos> If you put the gun down - I'll let you live.<eos> - No deal, asshole.<eos> Fine. So be it!<eos> Hey there.<eos> Easy now.<eos> It's ok.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> Got a new home for you with a lot more room.
Human help?<eos> God, you gotta be kidding.<eos> I mean, holding a baton or working in one of their factories, that's one thing.<eos> But what kind of shithead would help them set off a nuke?<eos> Here she is.<eos> We're in play.<eos> It's approaching the intersection.<eos> - Ready.<eos> - Start the ball.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?
You have no idea how much this means to me.<eos> No biggie.<eos> Zack.<eos> Come in.<eos> How are you today, my son?<eos> I was thinking.<eos> Maybe I don't need the White.<eos> I mean I'm breathing just fine.<eos> What's troubling you?<eos> The people who work for you... is it true they don't get fresh food?
- Nothing.<eos> No strigoi have gone in or come out since the tanker left.<eos> It's been over two hours.<eos> - I'm going in.<eos> - Wait, you can't be serious.<eos> There could be a thousand strigs in that place.<eos> Well, they're probably dead.<eos> Then why go in?<eos> Because "probably" isn't good enough.<eos> I'm coming with you.
So, turn me down again,<eos> and that's exactly where you're going.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> If I say yes, then I am just as bad as he is.<eos> But if I say no, he's gonna send me away.<eos> You have to do it.<eos> - I can't be part of this.<eos> - It doesn't matter whether you're part of it or not; he's gonna do it anyway.<eos> If you turn him down, he'll just find somebody else to take your place.<eos> And you'll get shipped out to God knows where and nobody will ever hear from you again.
Give the guy a break, will you?<eos> - Have some breakfast.<eos> - I'm not hungry.<eos> Irrelevant.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's hard to concentrate with "Che Guevara" up my ass.<eos> Find anything?<eos> There's a shipment today a few miles from here.<eos> I want to see it for myself.<eos> I'll go with you after you eat.
Look, these guys are gonna give you shit.<eos> Keep your head down, stay ready, and remember this is just a tool.<eos> This is your real weapon.<eos> And when it's time to pull the trigger, you don't hesitate or you're dead.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> You already got your cut.<eos> On the table, it's merchandise.<eos> - What's wrong with you?
Oh, you read that one?<eos> I never said four weeks.<eos> - You did too.<eos> - I said, "Yahoo!"<eos> Same thing.<eos> Why don't you get your boyfriend to put something new on the TV.<eos> "Boyfriend"?<eos> Marta...<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> You know, I'm usually a pretty good judge of character... but I was wrong about you.
I doubt it.<eos> You're feeling guilty.<eos> Feeling angry.<eos> Mostly at yourself.<eos> Because you spent all that time fighting and you thought maybe you could make a difference, and now you're back at square one.<eos> And you've lost your brother and your team,<eos> and now you're wondering... what was the point<eos> of any of it?<eos> I told you, I've been there.<eos> You and Jason relit a fire in me that I thought had gone out.
We're going through the front, like men.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Wanna bum-rush the front door?<eos> That's fine by me.<eos> But what are you gonna do about the trip wire?<eos> - What trip wire?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> We don't have any idea what's waiting for us behind that front door.<eos> And I don't wanna be the first one down that hallway.<eos> Do you?
You worried about strigoi?<eos> I'm worried about a strigoi Emily.<eos> Must have gone with her parents.<eos> You think?<eos> I don't see any cool new suitcase around here.<eos> You coming to bed?<eos> I should probably hit the couch.<eos> Didn't mean it like that.<eos> The safest thing for us to do is to be together.<eos> I promise I won't take advantage of you,
Charlotte's spoon feeding him our blood.<eos> You know, I think I've given enough.<eos> If they don't want to help, then I'll do it myself.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> We need those guys.<eos> I need no one.<eos> I've been hunting the Master on my own for over a thousand years.<eos> Yeah. Now how's that working out for you?<eos> Don't test me.<eos> Look, I get it. You don't like people, and most of them don't wanna share a beer with you.
If... money or property is of no allure to you...<eos> You'd do this for your brother?<eos> Please.<eos> He suffers so.<eos> I am indeed a demon, but my curse is my own.<eos> I have no gift, dark or light, to give.<eos> I beseech you.<eos> Visit my brother, if only to confirm his belief in the fantastic.<eos> Louisa, darling?<eos> Who is with you?
That's what they're counting on.<eos> That we will willingly go to the slaughter!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Restrain her!<eos> Guards!<eos> Guards!<eos> Control yourselves!<eos> Control yourselves!<eos> - Get the others out of here!<eos> - What about you?
Previously on This Is Us...<eos> I'm not sure you've ever experienced anything real your entire life.<eos> And that's our cue to leave.<eos> Our lead actress vanished a month ago, off the face of the planet.<eos> You got involved with her. You slept with the Tony-nominated star of my play - and ruined everything.<eos> - Yeah, well, you know, I slept with you, too. It didn't ruin anything.
Rebecca thinks that if we have kids, our lives are gonna be over.<eos> She's right, pal.<eos> I love our life.<eos> And I'm scared of changing it, 'cause the truth is when I close my eyes and I think about our future... I see us with kids, Jack.<eos> William Hill, I loved you and you left.<eos> Now I'd like to spend whatever time you have remaining together.<eos> Would you?<eos> Dad, grandpa's gay, or at least bi.<eos> What's that now?<eos> The one thing I cannot live without is you.
Thank you guys so much for having me.<eos> This is... there is an Uber here, he's outside, uh...<eos> - Bye.<eos> Sweetheart.<eos> I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "Kevin, this is not a flophouse"<eos> that you use for your dates." Mm-hmm.<eos> It won't happen again. Okay? I want you to know that.<eos> Also, you're probably thinking that me sleeping with the writer of a play that I'm producing is probably going to end up blowing up in my face, right?<eos> - Hmm, I'm on fire this morning. - Mm-hmm.<eos> But we artists don't have, you know, normal professional relationships.
Yeah.<eos> Since when do I have cheekbones?<eos> Come on.<eos> - Kevin, can I ask you something? - Yeah.<eos> Even though every feminist bone in my body will stop talking to me...<eos> What's up?<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Like, do we like each other?<eos> Are we just sleeping together?<eos> Because if we're just sleeping together, that's... that's totally fine. I... I mean, 'cause I can't, like, totally process that someone like you would sleep with me, so...
- Kevin, can I ask you something? - Yeah.<eos> Even though every feminist bone in my body will stop talking to me...<eos> What's up?<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Like, do we like each other?<eos> Are we just sleeping together?<eos> Because if we're just sleeping together, that's... that's totally fine. I... I mean, 'cause I can't, like, totally process that someone like you would sleep with me, so...<eos> Whoa, what does that even mean?<eos> Listen, here's the thing.<eos> I like you.
I made a physical change - to match the spiritual one. - Uh-huh.<eos> Look, you said a lot of things to me, Kevin. I mean, you told me I was cruel.<eos> But worse than cruel... inauthentic.<eos> But you were right.<eos> So I went away for a while to try to find some authenticity.<eos> And I did it, okay? I found it.<eos> I did ayahuasca with a shaman in the Salt Flats of Utah. I howled at the moon with the prairie coyotes of Kansas. I fished with the lobstermen of Maine.<eos> I mean, you did all that in a month?<eos> But, look, I'm back now, and I am better than ever.<eos> For the play, and for you.
For the play, and for you.<eos> Um... I want us to be together.<eos> Okay? I've changed.<eos> I'm, I'm ready for something real.<eos> Sorry, Olivia, but... we're dating now.<eos> Life goes on after you disappear.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Thank God.<eos> We were dead without you. Oh...
- Place of birth?<eos> Palm Springs. I hate surgery.<eos> I hate the word surgery.<eos> I hate, I hate surgeons.<eos> I hate sturgeon, the fish, 'cause it sounds like "surgeons."<eos> God, I'm freaking out.<eos> - Just breathe, babe.<eos> - Yeah. - Okay? - Yeah.<eos> Well, don't worry about me freaking out.<eos> Uh, well, I do have to worry about it, Kate, because the thing is, is that I'm kind of in love with you... is the thing.
Two beautiful women wanting to be with you, - that's not a problem. - Yeah.<eos> You want to know a problem? A problem is your dying biological father suddenly turning gay.<eos> - That's... - Why is that a problem?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> We are a hot mess, huh?<eos> Big Three?<eos> - Big Three.<eos> Mm. How are you, babe?<eos> I'm good. I'm good.<eos> How are you?
Sloane...<eos> Hey, Tobe.<eos> They said it went perfectly and that you're gonna be awake soon.<eos> So...<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Just an FYI.<eos> I've never said that to anyone I wasn't related to.<eos> Listen, this is scary.<eos> This is all just... scary, honestly.<eos> But I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Toby.
Me, Beth, the girls.<eos> Ever since Jessie came back into your life, it's like you don't care about spending time with us.<eos> And I'm not trying to act like some kind of jealous teenager, nor deny you your love life, be...<eos> And don't give me some damn story about your cat.<eos> I can feel it now, Randall.<eos> This cancer is coming for me sooner than later.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> He's seen this stuff.<eos> He's been helping me make arrangements, taking me to some of the best state-funded nursing homes, trying to find a good place to go before this gets really bad.<eos> I will not put this on you, Randall.
Totally her fault.<eos> I got out of my car to go scream at her... but I saw her face.<eos> And I walked right up to her and stuck out my hand like an idiot and said, "Hi, I'm Joe.<eos> Don't worry about what just happened.<eos> Could I take you out for a cup of coffee?"<eos> So that's why I'm really here, Father.<eos> I was wondering if I could be so bold to... ask you for a little miracle.<eos> It's hot.<eos> I'm so hot.<eos> Are you hot?
- Babe, the house isn't...<eos> Get out!<eos> Wow. What?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Okay, so now I'm the crazy wife who's making your life totally miserable,<eos> - huh? - I'm not miserable.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm-I'm starting to get stress vertigo anytime we have a conversation about a... a grocery list or, you know, any conversation, - for that matter.<eos> - Huh. But... you are carrying my children, so I'm gonna leave you to your afternoon.
What have I done now, Samantha?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You know what I asked him to help me with? Father Williams?<eos> I asked him to save my marriage.<eos> I see.<eos> Interesting to hear.<eos> I'm due at the station.<eos> So, what are we doing here again?<eos> 'Cause it's your birthday.<eos> And my gift to you is this... showing you the way.
Nah, man, it's...<eos> it's not my thing, pal.<eos> Last I checked it's not your thing, but...<eos> What? I'm just...<eos> I want to get back to Bec.<eos> - What?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> - I'm-I'm gonna take off...<eos> Give her space.<eos> There's gonna be plenty of time for you to become a martyr, I promise.
Birthday tradition doesn't care.<eos> - Yeah? Yeah?<eos> - Yeah. All right, cowboy.<eos> So, I'll meet you in the bedroom in five minutes.<eos> - You know what to do. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Strip down to your birthday suit.<eos> It's my home, Peter.<eos> I'd appreciate if everyone spoke at full volume.<eos> Now, what's on your mind?<eos> Dad, we're officially worried about you.
I wish.<eos> That would be a vacation.<eos> Maybe you could take a vacation.<eos> Please stop.<eos> Mom's gone, Dad.<eos> I know she's gone.<eos> You don't think I know she's gone?<eos> I buried her, Peter.<eos> I was married to her for 53 years and I buried her.<eos> I don't need you to tell me she's gone.
It wasn't a great moment for me.<eos> Tradition is tradition.<eos> Peter and Alli came over today.<eos> He is your son, through and through, that's for certain.<eos> Stubborn as a damn mule.<eos> He thinks he knows something 'cause he's been married for... what, ten whole years?<eos> I love that boy, but... my God.<eos> Carol, I'm gonna say something now, and you have to promise now not to be mad at me.<eos> Every morning, I open the, uh, medicine cabinet, and I just stare at all your...<eos> Baby, I don't know if I can keep doing this without you anymore.

He's been asking about the baby from the fire station.<eos> Might be thinking about adopting.<eos> Well, I'm out of here.<eos> - Night, Dr. Katowski.<eos> I, um told a young man about the baby, yesterday, hon.<eos> I haven't spoken to anybody about that in... a really long time.<eos> And I, uh... I gave him some advice.<eos> And it seems he may have actually listened to me.<eos> It seems he may have taken the worst thing that ever happened to him in his life, and tried to push on.<eos> There isn't a minute that goes by that I don't think of you.
So it's a win-win for everyone. (laughs)<eos> One laugh, that's it?<eos> It was...<eos> You can, uh, all thank my beautiful yet unfunny wife, Shelly, for that last one. Oh, thank you.<eos> Rebecca, actually, I have to apologize.<eos> For the first two months of your relationship...<eos> Jack bailed on me so much to go out with you that, uh, I started referring to you as Yoko Ono.<eos> (scattered laughs) I'm sorry.<eos> But then Jack started using words like "soul mate" and "forever."<eos> And he never really said stuff like that until he met you.
Miguel and Shelly.<eos> They can't get divorced.<eos> She's been unhappy.<eos> And you heard them-- there wasn't one thing, it just happened. No.<eos> No, come on, that's BS.<eos> You don't do that to your family.<eos> You find your soul mate, you get married, you stay together until you die, period.<eos> It's not always that simple.<eos> It is to me.<eos> Well, not everyone is you.
Oh, we've got to remember to check the white board.<eos> I didn't even know that was still there.<eos> Well, honey, you can't be playing chess at 3:00 in the morning.<eos> But Grandpa's always napping when I get home from school.<eos> And I have soccer on Saturdays.<eos> You said he's not going to be around forever, so I have to play with him as much as I can now.<eos> You have plenty of time to play chess with William.<eos> Now, come on, let's go.<eos> Upstairs.<eos> You and Annie can sleep with us tonight.
Uh, I'd like Sanjay to join you.<eos> Uh, all due respect, sir, but I've been doing this for 12 years.<eos> You're, uh, terrific. You both are.<eos> Which is why I want you both in on this.<eos> I know the hostess at Bouley.<eos> I can get us a res for dinner tonight. Tonight?<eos> You know what, tonight works great.<eos> I forgot how much I love watching you eat.<eos> You eat like a truck driver.<eos> You just think that 'cause you eat like a rabbit.
This was a mistake. No, no. Yeah.<eos> Just-Just calm down. Hold on a...<eos> Sophie, hold on.<eos> Sophie!<eos> Excuse me, excuse me.<eos> Sophie, hold on a second.<eos> You know, I forgot how fast you are in heels. Will you please just slow down a little bit?<eos> I just want to talk to you.<eos> What did I say?<eos> Sophie, will you please just slow down?
I'm sure that I will.<eos> Are you having an affair with Heather?<eos> Are you crazy? Huh?<eos> I would never have an affair. I wouldn't do that to my kids.<eos> So what then? What?<eos> What happened, huh?<eos> And don't tell me that you just, you drifted.<eos> We did, Jack. Yeah? We drift...<eos> yeah, we drifted, okay?<eos> And not everyone's like you and Rebecca.
How did you know about that?<eos> Oh, yeah, uh, well, it just-- it turns out you and I are Facebook friends.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> Except that we are.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> Uh... well, I'm-I'm Suehee Xiong. What?<eos> That's me.<eos> N...<eos> Yeah, no, I created a fake profile 'cause I...<eos> wanted to keep up with you.
Somewhere. (chuckles)<eos> But if you want to find out, you are gonna have to get in the car, right now. Okay.<eos> (both chuckle)<eos> All right. Yeah, pound.<eos> All right.<eos> Have a good one.<eos> I could get used to this.<eos> No, you couldn't, because you are not supposed to be here.<eos> What's up? Wha...<eos> I take this place seriously and you were acting like a total ass.
Hey, don't tell anybody the help's in here burning calories.<eos> Leave me alone. Ooh.<eos> Lover's quarrel? Trouble in paradise?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not eating.<eos> I can see that.<eos> That's what the old me would do.<eos> Eat and self-sabotage, and I'm not gonna do it. I'm just gonna sweat it out.<eos> I get it.<eos> I used to be like you.
I've been trying to focus on all of the little moments that... that I don't want to forget.<eos> But the moment that's burned into my brain and heart... * Mm-hmm ...is the first time I saw you.<eos> "Rebecca, you have changed the way I think about love." Hmm.<eos> "I know things may not always be easy..." Ha. That should have been my red flag.<eos> (laughs)<eos> You're... Ugh.<eos> You're stuck with me.<eos> "But our love "has always been worth it.<eos> I will encourage you, trust and respect you."<eos> I will create a home with you, full of laughter and compassion.

Previously on This Is Us...<eos> I've decided to have gastric bypass surgery.<eos> - Uh, I'm gonna do it.<eos> - Do what?<eos> The surgery.<eos> I just don't want you to freak out, okay?<eos> Don't worry about me freaking out.<eos> Uh, well, I do have to worry about it, Kate, because the thing is, is that I'm kind of in love with you.
Did you remember to write your name in all of your underwear?<eos> It's not that kind of camp.<eos> Are you sure that you're okay with me doing this?<eos> I know this isn't the best timing for us.<eos> Of course I am okay with it.<eos> Kate, we have the rest of our lives to spend together.<eos> Or at least the rest of mine, I had a heart attack at 40,<eos> - so I'm going first, obvi.<eos> - Toby.<eos> Look, this is an incredible opportunity, and I want you to do it for yourself.
And we're probably never gonna play it again, huh?<eos> - Hey, Jack?<eos> I think this whole thing is really sweet, but in less than 12 hours we're gonna have 45 kids here for three different birthday parties, so maybe a little less reminiscing a little bit more bedazzling?<eos> - Hey, Bec? - Yeah?<eos> What if we had another kid?<eos> Jack, we can barely take care of the three children we do have.<eos> Yeah, but they're not gonna be kids much longer.<eos> I mean, they're ten. That's halfway to adulthood.<eos> Just barely.<eos> And do you remember what happened the last time we tried to have a kid?
- We're not upset at all.<eos> How can they not like Randall?<eos> I don't know, he's the best. He's so sweet and smart and he's funny.<eos> Like, actually funny.<eos> - I know!<eos> - Not just little kid funny.<eos> Is it because he's black?<eos> Those racist bastards. Right? Jack, don't...<eos> - don't get emotional.<eos> - I'm not emotional. I'm not emotional, you're emotional.
No one wanted to learn how to Vogue.<eos> What?<eos> Why not?<eos> They all like Kevin more than me. - Everyone does.<eos> - Come on, no, that's not true.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - No, it's not true.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - No.<eos> You think I like Kevin more than I like you?
- Close your eyes.<eos> All right, now, I want you to picture the love of your life.<eos> Imagine that you have 30 seconds to win her back.<eos> One shot, three sentences.<eos> What are those sentences, and who are you saying them to?<eos> There it is.<eos> - I got it. - I got...<eos> All right.<eos> - We're doing this.<eos> - Okay. - Toby, you're a stud. You know that?
Hey, Kate.<eos> Strike a pose.<eos> Here we go!<eos> You all right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Go with God.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Kevin.<eos> Before you say anything, there's three sentences I need to say to you, okay?<eos> - I was head-over-heels in love with you the moment that I saw you.
Period.<eos> You gonna say anything, at all?<eos> - Kevin. - Yeah.<eos> My ex-husband who I haven't seen in 12 years just shows up at my doorstep unannounced.<eos> You know, I'm not exactly sure what you want me to say.<eos> Say, um... S... Say I can come in.<eos> I can't say that.<eos> Can you say you'll think about... meeting up with me? Maybe we can have a conversation, just... I want to talk to you.<eos> You always have to go big, don't you, Pearson?<eos> For you, Sophie... always.
We're not getting a dog. No?<eos> Eat this, Randall!<eos> Thank God.<eos> Surprise attack.<eos> Surprise attack!<eos> - Oh, I got you!<eos> I got a shield, I got a human shield!<eos> - Help me! - I have a human shield!<eos> Oh, no, no!<eos> It's all you, Will Hill.
Why? I told that jerk duke off.<eos> It turns out that his family actually owned the place, so...<eos> Well, that's a relief. Not the getting kicked out part, the, uh, part about duke.<eos> Why a relief?<eos> Um... I guess I was afraid that you might fall for him.<eos> What?<eos> Why? Because I was jealous.<eos> And I was worried.<eos> And then I started thinking,<eos> "why are you jealous and worried, toby? You're usually so confident and carefree and well-hung."
Jared leto?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't... no. He's like a bad boy.<eos> Really?<eos> Jared leto? He's kind of jared leto-ish.<eos> Hey, kate, it's me again.<eos> I'm freaking out over here, I need you to tell me that I'm not gonna bomb my opening night and become the laughingstock of new york city.<eos> - Anyway, listen, call me.<eos> - Hey. Uh, I know things have been weird between us, but I just wanted to say break a leg.<eos> Thank you, thank you.
You too. And congratulations, I mean, it's a beautiful play.<eos> You know, people are gonna love it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You think so?<eos> Yeah. Yes. Yes, I definitely think so, unless...<eos> I suck. 'cause ron said that the new york times is coming tonight.<eos> Which is crazy, I mean, the new york freaking times is gonna review our play.<eos> So right now travis bauman and I are neck and neck to finish first place in our class.<eos> But if I don't get an a on my hamlet essay...<eos> Hey, I will write that hamlet essay for you if you stop telling me this story.
- Yeah. Did you see his abs?<eos> Fair play.<eos> Did you have a pet when you were a kid?<eos> - I did. I had a pet turtle named shirley.<eos> As in laverne and.<eos> Of course.<eos> Were you, uh, popular in high school?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Did you just hear the name of my pet turtle?<eos> I did. - Huh? how about, how about you?
My colors.<eos> And it's on sale.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> My good man, do you have this dazzler in a 56 long?<eos> All right.<eos> I love that you love flashy clothes.<eos> Thank you. So, like, when did that start?<eos> I don't know, I've always just had a thing for fashion.<eos> You know, sixth grade, a well-fitting pair of z. Cavaricci jeans and I was done for.<eos> I love learning that about you.
What the hell's the matter with you?<eos> She told me I couldn't have a damn coca-cola.<eos> I can decide what I like to drink.<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> I know you're not a child.<eos> Okay?<eos> You are a sick old man and sick old men need nurses, william, to make sure they take their meds on time, and eat their meals on time, and don't die when nobody's looking.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> I need you to let the nurse take care of you, william.

I got to get back to the office. I got a big, important phone call that I cannot miss, so, please...<eos> William, will you let the nurse take care of you?
He was my person.<eos> He was the one that could steady you... When the world felt like it was spinning.<eos> Yeah, that was my dad. That's very true.<eos> Yeah, and you remind me of him, you know that?<eos> The way that you move your hands when you talk. The way you walk across a room.<eos> Sometimes you remind me of him so much that the hair on my arm stands up.<eos> It's why it breaks my heart that you don't like me, kevin.<eos> Because when I'm around you, I feel like I get a little piece of my best friend back.<eos> - Now, you... Are jack pearson's son.<eos> You have him inside of you.
I have put everything and everyone ahead of myself, you and the kids!<eos> And I just knew that if I were ever to tell you about this whole ben thing, you would spin out about it and I needed to have something for myself without you getting in the way.<eos> I never thought of myself as being in your way, bec.<eos> Ah, damn it.<eos> I-o-u-a-e-I-o-u-a-e-I-o. You're gonna bomb it, dude.<eos> Kevin?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Randall, hey.<eos> Uh, what can I do for you?<eos> Uh, you called me.
Okay, everyone, places for act one.<eos> Have a great show.<eos> We miss anything? No, no, welcome.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's just about to start.<eos> You guys made it in time.<eos> Your brother, is he coming?<eos> I can't believe we'll be out there in front of all those people in, like, 30 seconds.<eos> I'm imagining all of them in their underwear.<eos> What about you?
I don't know what to do, Beth.<eos> How do I honor his legacy?<eos> Do I start wearing sweater vests?<eos> Drink more egg creams?<eos> Could get cooler frames.<eos> Like, round ones, like the hipsters wear.<eos> William was kind of the O.G. hipster, right?<eos> Baby.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> The only thing anyone expects you to do is to plan a service.
Okay.<eos> It's 5:30.<eos> - Jack?<eos> - What?<eos> What?<eos> We're-- we're celebrating Pench's retirement.<eos> We hate Pench.<eos> - You hate Pench.<eos> - I do hate Pench.<eos> Look, just-- it's time for you to go home and say a proper good-bye to your wife. - Yeah.
They've been good to me, Beth.<eos> I've been out of the office for a while now...<eos> - After not taking a vacation in three years.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> You guys have fun.<eos> Call me, call me when you want to come home.<eos> Thanks, Mr. Pearson.<eos> Do you want this taxi to stop somewhere else?<eos> Are you and Mom all right?
Hey, look, you've got more important things to worry about being a teenager.<eos> Boys and-and grades and that band that sounds like they're always kidding...<eos> - what's their name? Weezer? - Weezer.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Weezer.<eos> Look, your mom and dad, we're the... we're last thing in the world you need to worry about.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't sit home tonight all sad.<eos> How can I be sad when I've got a kid like you?
So, William seems to have really connected with the girls in a short time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what he did.<eos> With everyone he met, it seems.<eos> You know your father.<eos> Jack, I mean.<eos> He, um... he taught you a lot about honesty and courage.<eos> But the truth is, you came into this world pretty perfect.<eos> You always had this, uh... gentleness, this inner kindness to you, from the start, and I think... you got that from William.<eos> I really thought I was doing the right thing for you and for our family...
How do I honor my father's legacy?<eos> Then I realized, I honor it by taking what I've learned from how he lived his life and having it shape the way I go on living mine.<eos> And so, here it is, Tyler.<eos> I quit.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> - No hard feelings, man.<eos> I walk out of here in triumph.<eos> I came, I saw...<eos> I conquered.<eos> Sanjay... it's all you now, brother.
It's because I thought the play was the only thing that mattered. You know?<eos> I looked out at that crowd tonight, I saw that empty seat.<eos> It made me sad, I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> But then I saw the other seats.<eos> You know, I saw my family and... I saw you all the way back there and I realized I didn't come to New York to be in a hit play.<eos> I came to New York to win back my girl.<eos> My girl who would drag a crutch all the way across town after a 12-hour shift for a stupid joke.<eos> - 14-hour shift. - Okay.<eos> Great joke.<eos> I'm not messing things up with you again.

You remember when I told you I... couldn't talk about my dad's death?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Well, that's because it's my fault.<eos> I'm the reason that he's dead.<eos> Hey, princess, it's Dad.<eos> I wanted to tell you something. I-I wanted-<eos> - I wanted you to know that you were right.<eos> I'm gonna fix things with your mom.<eos> I love you, Katie girl.<eos> All right, you have fun with your friends.

You have something to add?<eos> No.<eos> Please keep talking so we can all pretend that our problems are just in our heads.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means that you're in here because somebody said you're not normal.<eos> Like normal is this suit we're all supposed to...<eos> But you know who else wasn't normal?<eos> Picasso, Einstein.<eos> Ooh, I like her.<eos> I like you.

Look, forget it.<eos> I-I don't need this.<eos> Look, I have been more than...<eos> But now I really want to get out of here.<eos> Calm.<eos> Be calm.<eos> Nobody is...<eos> I just want to make sure I've got it right.<eos> You were her.<eos> She was you.
Titties.<eos> Having titties.<eos> Did you?<eos> If that were me, all day, I'd...<eos> Stop looking at me like that, man.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm dead.<eos> You killed me, and I got to say, not cool, man.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Yeah, you did.

What is so funny?<eos> I'm insane, you idiot.<eos> This is my delusion.<eos> It's not real.<eos> Stop screwing around.<eos> Where's the girl?<eos> What girl?<eos> Don't be clever, David.<eos> We know who you are.<eos> We know they came for her at the hospital thinking she was you.

I'm not really here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Where else would you be?<eos> This is your memory of the day you called the hospital, not the actual day.<eos> I'm inside your memory.<eos> But that's not...<eos> I've been projected into your memory.<eos> I've been looking, and no one would tell me...<eos> Syd, I don't understand.<eos> I was you.
Please, Sydney, I have to know.<eos> Is... is this...<eos> Is this real? Hmm?<eos> I mean, what if we're back at the hospital?<eos> What if none of this ever happened and we're... please, I have to know.<eos> Are you real?<eos> I'm real.<eos> This is real, okay?<eos> I'm here.<eos> I came back for you.
Take my hand.<eos> - Next time on "Legion"...<eos> - You're not schizophenic!<eos> You've powers!<eos> The things you see are real!<eos> You're very important to us, David.<eos> - Melanie thinks you're the Key.<eos> - The Key to what?<eos> Winning the war.<eos> The divisions were created by our government to track and study people like you and Syd.
They'd just begun to study it in my day.<eos> So you want to analyze my brain?<eos> You might not like what you find.<eos> I doubt that, John Leslie Stevenson.<eos> Born 1863 in London to Elizabeth Stevenson, a street prostitute.<eos> No surprise there.<eos> No father, but you fought your way to Oxford to the top of your class.<eos> Esteemed surgeon by day, killer by night.<eos> How do you know so much about me?<eos> I know things about you that you don't even know about yourself.
Do you remember her?<eos> I want to conduct some tests.<eos> Nothing too invasive.<eos> A controlled environment to study your psychopathy.<eos> What do I get?<eos> The time machine, of course.<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> It's under lock and key, courtesy of Vanessa Anders.<eos> It's also where your little friend, H.G. Wells, has been staying since he's been in New York.<eos> I can get it for you.
On Wall Street.<eos> Well, it's a shame you didn't wait a little longer to buy. All of this could've been yours.<eos> The Anders' house is for sale?<eos> Well, unofficially.<eos> I hear David's company is not doing well.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> May I refresh that for you?<eos> Such a gentleman.<eos> Amaretto sour.<eos> I'll come with you, honey.
It doesn't want to change, but my father discovered a better method, and I've perfected it.<eos> And once this new DNA is inside the brain, you can manipulate the chemistry in the brain to control how people think?<eos> You're catching on.<eos> Do you want to study me or change me?<eos> Don't you want to change?<eos> Not in the least.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Your impulse to kill, that blinding rage that consumes you.<eos> Don't you want to control it just...<eos> Just a teensy bit? Your son, Henry Ayers... He was a doctor like you before he died in Paris in 1918.

Your son, Henry Ayers... He was a doctor like you before he died in Paris in 1918.<eos> I wonder if he inherited your killer instincts.<eos> And aren't you curious?<eos> If I cared at all, I would have paid better attention to the women I slept with.<eos> Why am I so important to you, Brooke?
It was stupid for you to come to my house.<eos> I have the files for all the drug research.<eos> Do you want them or not?<eos> Let me see.<eos> You have no idea what I went through to get these.<eos> So do we have a deal?<eos> Is this everything on Project Utopia?<eos> That's what you asked for, isn't it?<eos> Amazing.<eos> Can you be implicated?
I got scared.<eos> It's been two weeks.<eos> Isn't this a bit much for just eating pork?<eos> It's not about eating pork. It's not about the religion.<eos> It's about you ignoring us, not realizing who you are.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You see, our parents raised us to be a good Muslim.<eos> When you went out to school, we gave you a Qur'an.<eos> I don't think you ever read it.<eos> When you act like this, we feel like we failed you.
When you act like this, we feel like we failed you.<eos> You know that's not true.<eos> Look, man, you can drink. You can eat pork. You can smoke Mary Jane.<eos> But when you do it in front of Mom, it hurts her feelings.<eos> I get it.<eos> All right, I have to go and watch some Super Singer.<eos> What's Super Singer?<eos> Super Singer is the Indian version of The Voice.<eos> Only Indian people sings, no whites.<eos> "Dev, when I went to school, my mother gave me a Qur'an, and I want to do the same for you.
Even though things didn't happen the way they should've.<eos> Simon.<eos> We've been preparing... everything we need, supplies, weapons, for when the Merge comes.<eos> And I'm proud of you.<eos> You stayed strong, you done everything I've asked.<eos> "The sins of the world will be washed away, and only the pure will be spared."<eos> - That's what you said!<eos> - This isn't a religion.<eos> It's a strategy.<eos> Now maybe you misunderstood... but I'm gonna do this with or without you.
Maybe that's why you two get on so well.<eos> When you were little, I told you if you ever got lost to go find a policeman.<eos> It's their job to protect us.<eos> I never thanked you... for protecting me.<eos> Hey, Puzzle Master. I think that hot water's ready for hot chocolate. Go set us up.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know how many shrinks they sent me to?<eos> Using empathy, stroking my cock, tying to bend me up like a pretty velvet bow.<eos> You all try the same tricks.<eos> Next time you try shit like that, I'm gonna bash your sweet little girl's fucking head in, you get me?
Is this true?<eos> Is there someone out there who can help us?<eos> You don't know what you're asking me.<eos> Hey, Emma!<eos> Bobby.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> We need to see Martin.<eos> Wait.<eos> He ain't strung three words together in 30 years.<eos> I don't know whether it was Helen and her scrambling his brain or... you putting a bullet in it.
- Please...<eos> - Please! - Daddy!<eos> - Take Amber, Allison. - Take her and get her out of here.<eos> - It's okay, baby.<eos> - It's okay! - Stop it!<eos> No. I'll do it, but get her out of here.<eos> - It's okay!<eos> - I love you, baby. It's okay!<eos> - Stop it! It's our bloodline that makes it so powerful.<eos> From me to you to her.
It ain't the plan.<eos> Plans change.<eos> Like I said, we gotta stick together.<eos> All right, I mean, think about Kay.<eos> She sees that you're strong, she's gonna stay strong, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There, that's my boy.<eos> I could use another taste. How about you?<eos> For sure, man.<eos> All right, you first.
Where's Germ?<eos> I told you.<eos> He bolted.<eos> He didn't say where.<eos> He wouldn't leave and not tell me.<eos> Next house is yours, Kay.<eos> No screw-ups this time, you hear?<eos> Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, California, New Mexico, Oklahoma all coming up zilch regarding Michael/Germ and a green van.<eos> All right, try, uh, Louisiana and Arkansas.<eos> Look at you, newbie McNewberson, with another good call.

Well, I'm going.<eos> These things take time.<eos> To scope.<eos> To observe.<eos> Who?<eos> How many?<eos> Defenses?<eos> Not just military.<eos> They have their own special help.<eos> People like you.
How does he look?<eos> He looks good.<eos> Strong.<eos> He lives in an ice cube.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How long has he been in there?<eos> The astral whatever?<eos> In February, it'll be 21 years.<eos> You know, David...<eos> In the beginning, he was just like you.
What do you wanna talk about?<eos> I wanna know your secret.<eos> - What do you...<eos> - I can smell it.<eos> See?<eos> The secret.<eos> Probably always, but now it's really clear.<eos> You know something about me.<eos> Wha...<eos> Look at you.
What's it doing, though?<eos> You know he can create a kind of mental projection space, something between reality and dream.<eos> An astral plane.<eos> Could we have been inside David's memory three times?<eos> Three times, we saw glitches, omissions.<eos> It's as if we've activated some kind of guardian.<eos> There's something in David's memory he does not want us to see.<eos> - Kerry.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I have a mission for you.
Then eight years later, little boy Cary wakes up in his room.<eos> And there is an eight-year-old Native girl playing with his train set.<eos> So for the next year, he thinks maybe he made her up, like his imaginary friend who comes and goes, but then he figures out...<eos> Then he figures out that... she lives inside of him,<eos> That they're... two people in one body.<eos> That's his side.<eos> What about you?<eos> Mm, what do you mean?<eos> You're a person too, with feelings.<eos> I'm asking what it's like for you.
You brought it in here, and now it's hunting you.<eos> There is no monster.<eos> It's just me.<eos> I know that.<eos> It's just me.<eos> It's my psychology.<eos> Mm, monster as metaphor.<eos> I like it.<eos> But wrong.<eos> It's part of you; that's true.
It's a trap.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Upstairs!<eos> Oh, all day, it's talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.<eos> My turn.<eos> ♪ I had what I thought ♪<eos> ♪ Were clear, open eyes ♪<eos> ♪ Bright blue ♪<eos> ♪ Vision of a lake ♪<eos> ♪ Carrying pictures to lay on you ♪
I told you not to trust them, okay?<eos> I mean, what kind of a name is Summerland?<eos> You know, you let your guard down, man.<eos> They gave you a shot, and now we're here.<eos> No, he said it wasn't the drugs.<eos> Who, Captain Nemo in his giant ice cube?<eos> Come on, man, they doped you up and kicked you out of your own body to do who knows what.<eos> Uncle Fiddly with the glasses and the angry girl inside him, they could be fingering you right now.<eos> Who are you, really?<eos> I'm you.

More like the one where you're folding laundry.<eos> Or eating.<eos> Everything seems normal, but somehow you know.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well.<eos> The old clock on the wall says it's time for your meds, so let's pick this up tomorrow.<eos> Okay?<eos> Sydney Barrett, nurse's station.<eos> This is warning number one.<eos> 29 you have, and 14 you have.
Do you ever worry you'll lose it?<eos> I-I used to.<eos> All the time... think about the mirage, or how this feeling, clarity... how maybe that's just, you know, a symptom of the other side of the disease kicking in.<eos> - You're talking about mania.<eos> - Yes.<eos> 'Cause people always talk about the depression side, but it's the... the other side, that invulnerable feeling that's... that's dangerous.<eos> I just don't wanna mess things up, you know?<eos> Now that I have balance.<eos> Stop.<eos> - No pie for you.
- Love.<eos> Have you guys noticed a door in the hall?<eos> It's not always there.<eos> So where is it?<eos> When it's not there, I mean.<eos> - Exactly. - What?<eos> How can a door be there and not be there at the same time?<eos> Uh, alternate dimensions, perhaps.<eos> Or physical displacement rooted in four-dimensional geometry.<eos> Or simpler still, the subject, you, confusing one hallway with another.
What do imaginary doors have to do with not wanting to be touched?<eos> What do you mean touched?<eos> You know, my thing.<eos> How I don't like to be touched.<eos> How it hurts me.<eos> Uh, well, um...<eos> That's not... you're in here because of, well, the delusional thinking, right?<eos> Seeing things that aren't real.<eos> No.<eos> That's you. Me?
Oh, me too.<eos> Don't.<eos> Did you ever eat an animal that was still living?<eos> There's a... smell.<eos> A heat.<eos> You're burning up.<eos> Cary! Cary!<eos> You can run, my love.<eos> But there's just no place to go.<eos> Nobody wants you here.
Our session's not until the morning.<eos> I know, I just... have you seen Syd?<eos> Have I seen her?<eos> No.<eos> But it is a locked ward.<eos> So she shouldn't be too hard to find...<eos> - I've looked everywhere.<eos> - Sit<eos> Please.<eos> I'm starting to wonder if she's really the right girl for you.
- Please.<eos> Lenny.<eos> Come on.<eos> We've known each other since the womb.<eos> What did you do to Syd?<eos> Oh, shut up!<eos> I tried making you comfortable.<eos> I let you have your friends, your woman.<eos> But the fact is it's too much work.<eos> And honestly, all I need from you is your body.

The... the halo is losing power.<eos> Hey, kid!<eos> And when it fails?<eos> Think of the Shadow King as a computer virus.<eos> It's been in David's head for decades.<eos> Learning his systems, bypassing his defenses.<eos> Now it's ready to override the original program.<eos> Meaning me.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Meaning you.
Why not?<eos> 'Cause David put a hat on?<eos> Look, front door closes, I go in the back.<eos> You like that, don't you?<eos> A little backdoor action.<eos> You're gonna help me.<eos> No.<eos> I'm really not.<eos> We're connected, kid.<eos> You, David, me.
General?<eos> Major Briggs wants permission<eos> - to launch the peacemaker.<eos> - No.<eos> Tell him to move one click closer then hold.<eos> I'm giving your man another hour.<eos> Mm, what happened?<eos> Doesn't matter, we'll probably all be dead in ten minutes.<eos> Why am I tied down?<eos> You tell me.
It's working.<eos> See?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's working.<eos> The only way you're gonna get me out without killing him is if I decide to leave on my own.<eos> Hold on, it... It's fighting back.<eos> No.<eos> Lenny.<eos> I was just wondering...<eos> What am I without you?
Meditation starts in 20 minutes, in the activity room.<eos> What did he do with it?<eos> What did he do with it?<eos> Hey, sexy.<eos> Tell me about the day David came to live with you.
These are for the others.<eos> Try not to draw attention to yourself.<eos> Because Farouk is watching.<eos> - Farouk?<eos> - Yeah, it's a long story.<eos> Just maintain the illusion.<eos> And be ready.<eos> I'll send a signal when I'm in place.<eos> This ought to be interesting.<eos> I'm coming for you, baby.
Oh, no, you're not... oh, don't tell me you're trapped in here with another thing...<eos> monster... whatever it is.<eos> - Hm?<eos> - No, he's up there.<eos> The monster. He tricked us into giving up control.<eos> Tricked you.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I-I got that part, man.<eos> But if you're not the monster, then...<eos> I'm you.
- There is no way out.<eos> Tell me, how can we be underground when we're not even inside our body?<eos> So if there's no body and no ground, then there's no coffin.<eos> It's just an idea.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> Good. Now, I want you to imagine a classroom.<eos> A what?<eos> A classroom.<eos> With a blackboard.<eos> We're gonna figure this thing out, you and me.
The scientist... uhh, a parasite?<eos> Yes.<eos> Write it down.<eos> It's not an insect, right?<eos> Not a botfly or a tapeworm.<eos> It's a...<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> It's a mutant.<eos> Like me.<eos> And has been with you a long time.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> David.<eos> Shh.<eos> Kerry.<eos> You okay?<eos> You?
- What about your potato?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I know you're not a fan of mealtime.<eos> Did you wanna...<eos> I'm good.<eos> All right.<eos> Did you want something?<eos> There's some... soup.<eos> You left me.<eos> I needed you and you left me.
- No.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - No.<eos> Not here.<eos> I should've told you about the man<eos> - and being adopted and...<eos> - The man?<eos> They are so...<eos> But I mean, now I know you weren't sick.<eos> And you had this thing inside of you.
Everything.<eos> When you have nothing left...<eos> All that time you spent with the Monkeys, with her...<eos> I mean, you'd know if this was a setup.<eos> She wants what we want.<eos> Miss Goines!<eos> Get out of there at once.<eos> The machine room is not a dormitory.<eos> You have quarters. Sleep there.<eos> You sleep there, 3PO.
Miss Goines...<eos> What is this image?<eos> A dying man.<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know.<eos> _<eos> So the Witness is at a compound here.<eos> We come up from the south, take out anybody position on side at the house.<eos> Sure, but it's gonna be well-protected.<eos> You and me and a couple of revolvers ain't gonna get it done, we're gonna need real firepower.
Sure, but it's gonna be well-protected.<eos> You and me and a couple of revolvers ain't gonna get it done, we're gonna need real firepower.<eos> Yeah, I had an idea about that.<eos> You remember Otero?<eos> Deacon's guy?<eos> His dad was a gunrunner.<eos> He used to run the whole operation out the back of a bakery.<eos> Ha, let's get a taste, brother.<eos> That don't look like bread, cupcake.<eos> Who the hell are you?
Well, that plan's gone a-rye.<eos> You win.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna circle around the other way.<eos> We get separated, meet you back at the Emerson.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Forget about me?<eos> - Deacon...<eos> You ready to get the hell out of here?<eos> You okay?<eos> Is Cole with you?
I saw Penn Station, then I got on a train, and before I knew it, I was going downtown.<eos> You went to see your mother?<eos> Are you out of your goddamned mind?<eos> Good old Roberta.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Never saw her.<eos> I never went in.<eos> Just being close enough where I could almost knock on the door, you know, almost see her face, that was good enough for me.<eos> Should be for you too, buddy.

Hey, Ramse, check it out.<eos> I never noticed the sign that day.<eos> I was busy... saving your life!<eos> Run!<eos> You remember what you said to me that day?<eos> That was the first time you called me brother.<eos> You said we were family.<eos> I loved you for that.<eos> What about your other family?<eos> You and Cassie in 1957, the house of cedar and pine.
That's bullshit. That's crazy.<eos> Is it?<eos> Think about it.<eos> What?<eos> We were together, but I...<eos> I undid it.<eos> It never happened.<eos> Your Army of the 12 Monkeys,<eos> Titan, the virus, the Witness, Sam.<eos> It starts with you, brother, you and her.

Brother.<eos> I know I'm not supposed to be here.<eos> You're hurt.<eos> Let's get you inside.<eos> I don't think I can do this alone.<eos> I need you to come home, Cassie.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna find someone to help you.<eos> Wait right here.<eos> How do you know that this was meant for you?
Previously on "12 Monkeys"...<eos> Because of you, my friend is on a mission, and now I'm having these nightmares.
- Yes!<eos> I tell them I want to sell off my collection of... whatever teacups, antique spoons, those dolls with the creepy eyes that follow you, and insist on seeing their security protocols.<eos> Next, we get the lay of the land.<eos> Come back after dark, and then...<eos> Scooby-Doo tiptoe style through the storage area, dodge security, find the painting, and steal the Word.<eos> You're forgetting something.<eos> Causality, remember?<eos> We are not stealing it!<eos> We are borrowing it.<eos> You and Cassie take some of Jones' super-duper-splinter-me-now injections, and come back here with the Word and make a copy, while me and Deacon stay back there and make sure nobody notices our Maltese "Constance" is missing its chewy secret center.
Calm down, everything will be fine.<eos> I hope we didn't change things.<eos> Thank you for keeping me informed.<eos> I'll alter my plans immediately.<eos> 1989... what a trip.<eos> You know they were playing Genesis in the lobby?<eos> You really shouldn't let Jennifer dress you.<eos> I will have a scotch, neat, with a beer back.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Cheers to you.
Ah... "Thomas Crown Affair."<eos> Wait!<eos> We need a Trojan horse!<eos> Smuggle ourselves into the building tonight.<eos> So we're already in place before the painting shows up in the morning.<eos> Sneaking around like that gives us a much smaller window... minutes, maybe.<eos> I am not signing up for any plan that has me hiding inside anything.<eos> I am done with small spaces.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> You and Jennifer can go in through the front door.

Guess that leaves you and me.<eos> So where do we get the horse?<eos> How many antique cars does your father have?<eos> Enough to need a warehouse.<eos> He likes to collect things, keep them locked up.<eos> Was it weird?<eos> Pretending to be your mother?<eos> I didn't have to go all Method or anything.<eos> That'd require me being 100% more homicidal.<eos> We could change that... for you.
Pretending to be your mother?<eos> I didn't have to go all Method or anything.<eos> That'd require me being 100% more homicidal.<eos> We could change that... for you.<eos> It's 1989.<eos> Your mother tries to drown you in '91.<eos> We could warn someone, maybe get you some help.<eos> I don't know who I'd be if I wasn't the kid whose mom tried to kill her.<eos> Sort of a defining moment in one's life, you know.<eos> What about you?
It has to be in here somewhere.<eos> This is the last place.<eos> Well, we have to find it.<eos> Let's, uh, retrace your steps.<eos> These are my steps.<eos> Wait.<eos> I got it.<eos> Hate for it to not be there when you find my corpse.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> I wouldn't have fallen in love with you if you weren't.
The CLF released almost 1,600 hostages, but 122 are still inside.<eos> I don't know who's still alive.<eos> I don't know who the Citizen's Liberation Front are and what they want.<eos> I just know the FBI has to stop them, which is how I ended up here.<eos> All right, Parrish.<eos> What'd you get yourself into this time?<eos> Hannah?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I think the better question is, what are you doing here?<eos> The center of a conspiracy that no one magically knows about but you, again.
I said a layer has been peeled off.<eos> I didn't say there weren't still 20 more to go.<eos> We were there to spy on other CIA recruits potentially being enlisted into a rogue group inside of the agency.<eos> You failed.<eos> You left the FBI.<eos> Yeah, they thought I couldn't do the job.<eos> Were they right?<eos> Eight square blocks of downtown Manhattan say otherwise.<eos> So, this hidden group,<eos> Ryan infiltrated them, but you didn't?
I was using whatever I could get my hands on.<eos> You know, dirty needles.<eos> I gave her up.<eos> She had a good family.<eos> They were good to her.<eos> They took care of her.<eos> And then I came back into her life, and I ruined everything.<eos> I'm sure that's not true.<eos> She found me a couple years ago.<eos> You know, one of those agencies, and, uh...
You know, one of those agencies, and, uh...<eos> Right after we reconnected, she was shot.<eos> For the first time.<eos> Hey. Hey, that's just a coincidence.<eos> Every time. Every time we get close, something bad happens.<eos> Ruth, listen to me.<eos> Luck's not in charge here.<eos> I am.<eos> Next few hours are critical, and we're doing everything we can to manage her bleeding.<eos> Just hang in there and you will see her, all right?
I am.<eos> Next few hours are critical, and we're doing everything we can to manage her bleeding.<eos> Just hang in there and you will see her, all right?<eos> Dr. Dustiny? Oh, sorry.<eos> Did I wake you?<eos> No, dude, it's cool.<eos> I was just, uh, just resting my ass.<eos> Little drowsy, I guess.<eos> Your discharge papers.<eos> Ah, you're kicking me out of here already, with an ass like the Elephant Man.
- Swelling goes down.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll get you some crutches before you head out.<eos> Dustin, have you been using cocaine?<eos> What?<eos> Like recently?<eos> I'm not judging.<eos> Everything you say in here is privileged.
What?<eos> Like recently?<eos> I'm not judging.<eos> Everything you say in here is privileged.<eos> I just celebrated five years sober.<eos> Never dance without it.<eos> It reminds me of messier times.<eos> Right.

Of course you did.

- I was following a hunch, and I think Dr. Dustiny...<eos> I mean, Dustiny...<eos> Dustin...<eos> I think he has a skull fracture.<eos> When he fell off the stage, he also fell onto his right ear, and his gait was affected.<eos> And the clear liquid coming from his nose wasn't from drug use.<eos> - Brain fluid?<eos> - Good catch, Cass.<eos> Well, I need to check with Dr. Hamza to confirm, obviously.<eos> So? What are you waiting for?

Charlie doesn't have any friends.<eos> Thank you, Dawn.<eos> No, seriously, you guys,<eos> I'm-I'm in a lot of pain here.<eos> Have you tried mindful breathing, Charlie?<eos> Charlie's more of a old school kind of guy.<eos> Old school kind of guy?<eos> Well, old school, meet new school.<eos> This is what I call Zen surgery.<eos> Dawn. You won't even know I was here, Charlie.
Well, do I go towards them or run like hell?<eos> You stay away.<eos> Stay away from the carotid artery.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Uh, Doc...<eos> Dr. Palmer? I'm having trouble controlling the artery.<eos> I need to go towards the light.<eos> The bleed must be bigger than we thought.<eos> We need to get him to the O.R. now.<eos> - You wait.
No wonder I have you on nights.<eos> All right, so what's the plan?<eos> We find the bleed, sew it up, save Charlie's arm.<eos> - And Plan "B"?<eos> - There is no Plan "B."<eos> Plan "C" is you get too frisky in there, I turf you.<eos> But how is there a Plan "C" if there's no Plan "B"?<eos> Well, you've obviously never operated with the Chief of Surgery before.<eos> So was Nancy Drew right?<eos> No, you mean...

No, no. He needs an O.R. right away.<eos> Yeah, that's why we're here.<eos> When can you operate?<eos> Me? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> My colleague, Dr. James...<eos> he'll do the procedure.<eos> You know him.<eos> Well... back in the day, after Victor, before Jonathan,<eos> I was a committed patron at his place of business.<eos> I-I never had you pegged for a-a Lumberjaxxx kind of guy, Shahir.

Due to his obvious assets... - and the whole doctor thing, that was...<eos> - Mm-hmm. He was one of my favorites.<eos> You can still operate on him.<eos> No, no. No, I'm too close to this one.<eos> You operated on Charlie twice.
Yeah. Guess I could say the same thing for you.<eos> Mm. Clever Concoctions.<eos> Sorry?<eos> It's the catering company.<eos> They own it.<eos> Right.<eos> I can help you with that bow tie. Uh, you can't, actually. It's one of the many mysteries.<eos> Well, it looks cool like that, too.<eos> - It's very Clooney. - Hmm.<eos> Like you're at the end of a long wedding night.

I actually proposed tonight.<eos> It's to my doctor, isn't it?<eos> I saw you two at the dinner.<eos> You know, the first time we were supposed to get married,<eos> I, um... well, we got into a car accident, and I ended up in a coma for eight months.<eos> And when I woke up, I could talk to, um... Dead people?<eos> Spirits.<eos> And because of that, the second time we were supposed to get married,<eos> I didn't show up.<eos> Well, you know what they say.

No, there's no need.<eos> Really.<eos> I can't imagine what you've been through, Dr. Kinney.
Thanks, kiddo.<eos> Good talk.<eos> Ruth?<eos> Where you going?<eos> Um, just gonna go get some air.<eos> Don't leave.<eos> I have to.<eos> If the next few hours are critical,<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> Yes, you should.

- No, she's not.<eos> - She's fine.<eos> No. You need to go to her now.<eos> - Charlie. Charlie, I was just with her. - Alex...<eos> - She's fine!<eos> - Go to her.<eos> I'm really scared.<eos> Go now.<eos> Ruth. I should've gone.<eos> You made me stay.
I killed her.<eos> So can we officially call this the calm after the storm and make out?<eos> Well, we have been up for 36 hours, so... that might be the only way we can stay awake.<eos> Come in!<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Kind of.<eos> Dawn, um... I need a minute.<eos> All right, well, I should probably get to the E.R.<eos> You know, emergencies and whatnot.
where now, Christian men and women suffer under the dark rule of the Danes.<eos> There are two Northmen, Sigefrid and Erik, two Godless brothers with a voracious appetite for land, silver, slaves and war.<eos> I want it known... and I want them to know... that God, Alfred and the Ealdormen of Wessex are watching.<eos> The day of reckoning will come!<eos> Make way, make way.<eos> Is this the palace of King Alfred?<eos> Halt!<eos> Stand back from the king's guard.<eos> I have a letter that he will wish to read.<eos> You must let me pass!

Speaking directly from heaven.<eos> The abbot tells of Cuthbert's instruction within the letter.<eos> Lord, for the Saxons and Britons in the North, there is an urgency.<eos> We are lost, we are, in general, ruled by Danes, we are in need of a Christian saviour.<eos> This saviour is Guthred.<eos> A man who is a lowly slave and who himself must first be saved.<eos> At the behest of the blessed Cuthbert.<eos> The doors are open to the elements, Brother Trew, nothing more.<eos> It can be done, Lord, it can be arranged... with your help and guidance.<eos> And you shall have it, Brother Trew, I'm sure.
Smoke.<eos> Come on.<eos> Danes.<eos> Danes would not slaughter Danes like this.<eos> If there is slaughter, Lord, and there appears to be slaughter, why do we ride towards it?<eos> We are curious.<eos> Fight the Dane!<eos> Test your sword-craft!<eos> Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!<eos> You can cut him, but you cannot kill him!
A coin, Lord?<eos> - He would be my income for a year!<eos> - No more word, I'm warning you!<eos> - Leave now.<eos> - What?<eos> Go.<eos> You!<eos> You!<eos> State your name and your business!<eos> You keep the company of a nun, yet look every piece of you a Dane.
You are the Uhtred?<eos> Who served with Alfred at Ethandun?<eos> I am.<eos> Praise Him.<eos> Praise God!<eos> It is a sign!<eos> You know of Ethandun?<eos> Not only do we know of this battle, Lord, we have risen because of it.<eos> And just days ago, Alfred has sent his very own priest.<eos> You killed all the Danes that ruled Eoferwic?
Lord, there are horsemen missing.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - Men are missing.<eos> I counted five more horses than are here.<eos> They must be hiding, Lord.<eos> Priest... is my man correct?<eos> There are further horsemen?<eos> He is correct, Lord.<eos> But these horsemen, they came from nowhere and asking us to where we were travelling and we prayed that they would leave us, vanish.<eos> You wanted rid of them?

I am Odin's messenger to command.<eos> I come from Corpse Hall.<eos> You are Sven Kjartanson?<eos> You will answer me!<eos> What do you want with Sven Kjartanson?<eos> I've been sent to take the souls of both Kjartan and his son.<eos> Attack...<eos> Attack!<eos> No man shall move, or Sven Kjartanson will die!<eos> You will all hear me!
Your king, he is coming!<eos> Prepare!<eos> Your king!<eos> He will be here soon.<eos> Be sure to greet him.<eos> Make him feel welcome.<eos> The abbot... where is the abbot?<eos> Brother Trew.<eos> - Lady Gisela.<eos> - You appear to have news.
Great news!<eos> - What?<eos> - He's here.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Your brother, the king.<eos> He lives?<eos> Oh, he is well and he is near, very near.<eos> I must inform Abbot Eadred.<eos> Lord Abbot... he is here.<eos> They believe you to be the king, Lord.
You will stop this nonsense.<eos> Beocca, they love me!<eos> Because they have no idea what a fool you are!<eos> Be careful, priest, or he will have your head.<eos> Not before he feels my boot!<eos> And may I present to you Queen Hild of the water bucket, scourge of slavers and once thrown out of the nunnery!<eos> I was not!<eos> The Lord tells lies and all too easily.<eos> I will be the first to greet him formally.<eos> - You will all wait upon my word.
Of course!<eos> Now I see the true likeness.<eos> Forgive me, Lord.<eos> I have the eyes of an old man.<eos> Lord King, I am the abbot Eadred.<eos> And it is I to whom...<eos> - the blessed Saint Cuthbert...<eos> - Abbot Eadred...<eos> I have been told of your dream.<eos> You... must be a most holy man.
Is it him, Father?<eos> It is.<eos> 200 years after his death, he remains whole.<eos> A sign of the depth of his holiness.<eos> Oh, most holy Cuthbert... guide us and lead us and bring us to your glory, in the name of him who died for us.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> See how the flesh is uncorrupted.<eos> A miracle.<eos> You will take his hand, Lord... and swear your oath.
See how the flesh is uncorrupted.<eos> A miracle.<eos> You will take his hand, Lord... and swear your oath.<eos> Uhtred... you are the commander of my household troops.<eos> You will be beside me.<eos> Uhtred, you will kneel.<eos> Take his hand, Lord.<eos> God and the blessed Saint Cuthbert have given us this day a king.<eos> A king who shall raise an army and that army shall march in his name and all evil shall be expunged!<eos> This... you swear.
Although he lacks humility, Uhtred is the reason we are alive.<eos> Ah, he gave you protection out of the goodness of his heart, did he?<eos> What does he want with Cumbraland and with our king?<eos> He wants Bebbanburg, his ancestral home.<eos> And it's in the king's gift to help him.<eos> Hm.<eos> He will need to be watched.<eos> He's a pretender, I'm sure.<eos> Please...<eos> You have men in Northumbria still?
Oh, they do, but it is the Danes that rule.<eos> Though warlords must now look elsewhere for war, to Ireland and Alba.<eos> War is how a man makes his wealth.<eos> I disagree.<eos> War is how a man takes his wealth, Earl Ragnar, it is the land and trade that makes it.<eos> And for the land and trade to flourish, there must be peace.<eos> To be Viking is a way of life.<eos> To be Viking is a way to die.<eos> And there are many Danes, I believe, who want more from life than death.<eos> Lord... you are never more alive than when you sail a ship onto a new shore.
Did the missing person use an aluminum-based deodorant?<eos> Woman: The man didn't shower for five years.<eos> Hygiene was not a priority. Nora:<eos> Did the missing person have visual impairment or wear corrective lenses?<eos> Woman: No.<eos> Uh, no, ma'am. He had 20/20 vision.<eos> He could see from the top of that pillar all the way to the bridge.<eos> Nora: Can you please describe your relationship to the missing person?
And he ate and he peed and he shit up there.<eos> He never came down, never touched another person, not even his own wife.<eos> That man never wavered.<eos> He proved himself to God, and-- and last night he got his reward.<eos> - You saw him depart? - Yes, ma'am.<eos> He looked so calm and at peace.<eos> And all of a sudden, he just kind of faded out like he was on a dimmer.<eos> And, um-- and he was gone.<eos> And it was beautiful.<eos> So, you just happened to be awake and looking right at him at the exact moment that he, uh, dimmed out?
It's exciting.<eos> Y'all have a nice day.<eos> I didn't leave it in the bathroom.<eos> If we can't have a sense of humor about you being the Messiah, we're gonna have a problem.<eos> These are his personal effects.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Me, too, me, too.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> Well, I appreciate that very much, sweetheart.<eos> If you don't mind, I'm just gonna sit here and smoke my coping mechanism.

Thank you, Jesus.<eos> Hi.<eos> You know what happened to him?
God bless?<eos> Who gives a shit if they wanna believe that he lifted?<eos> It's not true.<eos> Well, in 10 days when the world doesn't end, they're all gonna go home and they're gonna find something else that's not true.<eos> Till then, I need to keep things nice and calm.<eos> - I am nice and calm.<eos> You're the calmest and the nicest person I know.<eos> Hard part's over.<eos> Just gonna crack this open, okay?<eos> And you are free.

It's Mark Linn-Baker.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Mark Linn-Baker.<eos> I'm, uh, calling on behalf of a third party and they-- well, they've asked me to ask you would you like to see your children again?<eos> What?<eos> Your children, Erin and Jeremy, would you like to see them again?<eos> I've got news for you, you shit.<eos> Your third party obviously doesn't know that I'm a fraud investigator for the DSD and I'm gonna have this call traced and I'm gonna find out what exactly it is--<eos> They know your kids' names, Nora.<eos> I'm pretty sure they know what you do.

Try not to walk on too much water when I'm gone, okay? - I won't.<eos> And I love you, too.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> May I help you, ma'am?<eos> Uh, this isn't letting me hit "no."<eos> And are you traveling with an infant today?<eos> - No.<eos> It must be a dead spot.<eos> Just go ahead and click yes. It doesn't matter. You're only taking up one seat.

- Yes, that's right.<eos> - Great.<eos> Is there anything else that I can help you with?<eos> Actually, I'm here to meet with one of your guests.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> May I have the guest's name, please?<eos> Um, Mark Linn-Baker.<eos> Mark: Who is it?<eos> They just called from downstairs.<eos> You know who it is.
I bought this suit yesterday.<eos> They just sent a guy up, measures me. Two hours later, it's back.<eos> I never had a suit fit like this in my life.<eos> It's very nice.<eos> May I have your cell phone, please? - What?<eos> - Your phone.<eos> I just need to make sure you're not recording this.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Please?<eos> What-- what are you doing? !
Uh, sorry.<eos> I took notes.<eos> - I don't wanna mess up the science. - Mm.<eos> There are a couple types of radiation-- non-ionizing and ionizing.<eos> Now, there are a couple types of that.<eos> There's alpha, beta, gamma, and neutron.<eos> Neutron is rare.<eos> You only find it near particle accelerators or reactors.<eos> And yet, trace amounts were catalogued within the first 48 hours following October 14th at sites where departures occurred.<eos> - You with me so far?
If they could recreate it?<eos> They could build a device and whatever they put inside that device, they could blast it with that radiation... and it would go.<eos> Go? Where?<eos> Wherever they went.<eos> The 2%.<eos> So, they built it, this device?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Then why haven't I heard of it?<eos> No one would let them conduct beta testing on live subjects.<eos> - You mean people? - Right.
- Then why haven't I heard of it?<eos> No one would let them conduct beta testing on live subjects.<eos> - You mean people? - Right.<eos> Because they were blasting them with radiation?<eos> Exactly.<eos> So, they had to leave Switzerland.<eos> The unit is mobile now.<eos> They don't stay in one place for too long.<eos> That was smart of them.<eos> I know what you're thinking.

Where's Lauren now?<eos> She went through.<eos> - Through?<eos> - Through.<eos> So, what's the cost?<eos> Well, it's different for everyone.<eos> Uh, I think it's based on a percentage of your overall net worth.<eos> - I can tell you what I paid--<eos> - Mark. - Yeah?<eos> - I don't know if you are a part of this or a victim of it, but if this is real, if they've actually built this device, they're not sending people to some magical place
They are not hapless suckers, not victims.<eos> Each and every one of them had to pass an IQ test to qualify.<eos> There's a Nobel laureate in there.<eos> I have two degrees from Yale.<eos> Are you married, Mark?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I'm in a committed relationship.<eos> Oh, well, then I guess I am just wasting my breath, huh?<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> And I think you may be suicidal.
That's not yours.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> This is yours, right?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Nora?<eos> Christine, hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> What are you doing here?
Who are you?<eos> Nora?<eos> Christine, hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Uh, I'm in town on-- on business.<eos> So...<eos> It's great to see you.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Austin International Airport where the local time is about 4:35 PM.<eos> If you're visiting Texas, we're happy to have y'all with us.

He had moved on.<eos> He had a new family.<eos> So, I wish they wouldn't have told me, because I was already where I belonged.<eos> Well, do you know what I wish?<eos> I wish you'd never left her for me.<eos> I didn't leave Lily for you, Nora.<eos> I left her for my dad.<eos> I didn't even know you existed.<eos> Can I print a photo from this?<eos> Which one do you wanna print?

Sorry?<eos> Are you, like, uh, clairvoyant?<eos> Can you see into the future?<eos> - Uh, no, chief. - No?<eos> It's just that you've concluded that nothing's gonna happen tonight because nothing has happened?<eos> I-it's just, um,<eos> Ginny's not feeling well, so...<eos> Ginny?<eos> Who's that?<eos> You know who she is.
You're talking about your dog, aren't ya?<eos> Yeah, well, I'm afraid little Ginny's gonna have to wait for you to come home tonight because, uh, you're on duty.<eos> Yes, Chief. - Yep.<eos> - Good.<eos> Cruiser one's got 'roo brains all over it, so give it a wash, will ya?<eos> I'm gonna take yours.<eos> Good evening.<eos> G'day, sweetheart.<eos> Ladies.<eos> May I ask why you're blocking my driveway?
Ladies.<eos> May I ask why you're blocking my driveway?<eos> Are you chief of police?<eos> Indeed I am.<eos> Is your name Kevin?<eos> Indeed it is.<eos> "And He looked at them and raised His hand, but they did not wave in response.<eos> And so He clutched the stone to His chest and jumped into the water."<eos> I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.<eos> I know who you are.

I can explain everything.<eos> No, no, no, I don't want you to explain fucking anything.<eos> I want you to get the fuck off my property and...<eos> Jesus, Florence!<eos> He wasn't coming.<eos> What the fuck? !<eos> What's happening?<eos> It's all right.<eos> You're amongst friends.<eos> We know who you are.

You took it without permission.
Why?<eos> Because he's crazy, Kevin.<eos> But the President's okay, right?<eos> Yeah, buddy.

I misplaced it.<eos> You need to talk to Sharon.<eos> Okay. Who's Sharon?<eos> She's a Liaison to the Indigenous Community.<eos> All due respect, friend, I don't need a Liaison.<eos> I'm a member of the Indigenous Community.<eos> Sharon's over at the Cultural Center on Borland Circuit.<eos> Anything else?<eos> I had my mail forwarded.<eos> I heard how helpful you were down here.
May I see some ID?<eos> Unfortunately, I lost it.<eos> But I can tell you the return address.<eos> One Matthew Jamison.<eos> Miracle, Texas.<eos> US of A.<eos> If that's not enough, I can tell you what's inside.<eos> You know the best-selling book of all time?<eos> I reckon it's the Bible.<eos> You reckon right, my friend.
Motherfucker!<eos> Is your daddy home?<eos> Let Mommy, honey.<eos> Hello.<eos> This is.<eos> Frank Johnson from the Episcopal council.<eos> Can I speak to Reverend Matt Jamison?<eos> - Frank Johnson?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Are you sure this isn't the Former. Police Chief of Mapleton, New York?
It's not so I'll keep my mouth shut and not tell my son you're writing an unauthorized fucking biography about him?<eos> Kevin, telling him would not be a good idea.<eos> He needs to just go through his life.<eos> Knowing any of this would not be in his best interests.<eos> It would be in your best interest to pick up some scuba gear, because if I fail down here, you are gonna be under a fuck of a lot of water, shithead!<eos> Okay. Best of luck with that, Kevin.<eos> Go fuck yourself, Matt.<eos> Excuse me. Is Sharon around?<eos> She's in the crapper.<eos> You can wait in her office.

I am trying to fucking save these people.<eos> Save them from what? ! Oi!<eos> Christopher Sunday.<eos> I'm sorry if I mispronounced.<eos> Are you Christopher Sunday?<eos> Chris.<eos> Chris, it's a real honor to meet you.<eos> I am Kevin, Totem of the Bush Snake.<eos> I've come a long way to find you.<eos> You're scared.
You're a big kid now.<eos> You have to or it won't stop.<eos> It's gonna get in the car!<eos> We're pulled over. We're safe.<eos> Please, Daddy?<eos> Just sing it.<eos> You did it!<eos> On the seventh-year anniversary of the Sudden Departure, I believe the rains will come, and with them a great flood.<eos> I have to sing to make it stop.<eos> You have to sing?

Remember, we've got a deal!<eos> I rolled the other way.<eos> You saw me, right?<eos> I... I tried to miss you.<eos> - Chris, can you hear me?<eos> - Settle down.<eos> I'm just concerned that when we get to the hospital, they're gonna separate us.<eos> And Chris promised he'd teach me something.<eos> Didn't you, Chris?<eos> Chris, Chris, Chris, nod if you can hear me.

I'm sorry I lost it.<eos> You're gonna leave me here? !<eos> Fuck me!<eos> I don't think this is the way we're supposed to go.<eos> Garvey men don't follow a highlighter on a goddamn triptych, son.<eos> But what if we get lost?<eos> AAA wants you to take the interstates to get you to drive by the AAA Howard Johnsons and the AAA giant balls of twine.<eos> You want a real adventure, you gotta chart your own course.<eos> Stop!<eos> Man, what are you doing?

Slow down, slow down.<eos> Let's just talk for a sec.<eos> They didn't take me.<eos> Buddy, they didn't take most of us.<eos> You're not alone, trust me.

Look, I... I need you to call the Kurripa Hospital.<eos> That's Kur-rip-pa.<eos> Find out if there's a patient there named Christopher Sunday.<eos> You threw it away?<eos> My friend, you've gotta move past that dumb book of yours.<eos> I don't know where I am, but once I find out, I'm gonna need your help in getting to this hospital.<eos> Go fuck yourself.<eos> - Hey there!<eos> - Hello.<eos> You're building a boat.
For the flood.<eos> I need to get to the hospital in Kurripa.<eos> Any chance you guys could give me a ride there?<eos> Lady of the house will take better care of you than the hospital.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Anybody here know Christopher Sunday?<eos> Yeah, sure. We all know each other.<eos> It's a tiny country.<eos> I know Chris.<eos> You're the fella that landed on him.
Okay, let him up!<eos> What are you ladies up to?<eos> Come on.<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> How's your arm?<eos> Itches like hell.<eos> We get a lot of brown and tiger snakes out here.<eos> I gave you antivenom for both just to be safe.<eos> Much obliged.<eos> You looked through my photos.
I was hungry.<eos> It was in the fridge.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Grace.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - I'm Kev...<eos> - I just killed a man.<eos> I'll turn myself in tomorrow.<eos> The other ladies you saw, they had nothing to do with it.<eos> I'm hoping you'll consider leaving them out of whatever you tell the police.

I keep forgetting that.<eos> You were with them?
What are the chances of that?<eos> It had to be him.<eos> So, I went to him, to Kevin, and I asked for his help.<eos> And when he refused, I drowned him...<eos> Because I thought he was testing me.<eos> Because I thought he'd come back.<eos> And once I'd proven my faith, he would have no choice but to help me talk to my children one last time.<eos> So, I thought you were sent by God.<eos> Sent with a message just for me.<eos> But you're not an angel.
Sent with a message just for me.<eos> But you're not an angel.<eos> There is no message.<eos> And God doesn't care about me.<eos> It's all just a story I told myself.<eos> It's just a stupid, silly story.<eos> And I believed it because...<eos> I've gotta be crazy, haven't I?<eos> No, Grace.<eos> I don't think you're crazy at all.

The... the thing that zaps them with the radiation?<eos> Yes, honey, the thing that zaps them with the radiation.<eos> And were they?<eos> - Still there? - No.<eos> Every single one of them is unaccounted for.<eos> - Where'd they go?<eos> - Nowhere.<eos> Well, I mean, they have to go somewhere.<eos> Not if they're being cremated.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the seat belt sign is now turned off and you are free to move about the cabin.
Yeah, sure.<eos> I'll be back soon.<eos> God, motherfucker.<eos> G'day, Melbourne!<eos> It's a beautiful Tuesday, and I'm Pam Jolly.<eos> And I'm Bruce Quartermain.<eos> Today is October 9th, and I have to say I'm a bit groggy.<eos> How was your night, Bruce?<eos> I had a big night last night.<eos> - Did you go to the party?
- Good morning. - Front desk.<eos> Yeah, I can't turn off my television.<eos> - I can't see where it's plugged in.<eos> - Yeah, so sorry about that. It's powered from the wall.<eos> Happens sometimes.<eos> I can reset it from down here.<eos> It'll just be a moment, Mr. Durst.<eos> - It's Mr. Garvey.<eos> - So sorry.<eos> Would you like us to add your name to the room so you can have access to all the guest amenities?
- Yeah, so sorry about that.

Thank you.<eos> Well, I'm ashamed to say that I did, Pam, but at least I get to be having pancakes with you here this morning, right?<eos> - Do you like pancakes, Bruce?
Well, I'm ashamed to say that I did, Pam, but at least I get to be having pancakes with you here this morning, right?<eos> - Do you like pancakes, Bruce?<eos> - Well, now, who doesn't like pancakes?<eos> Well, no one in their right mind, that's what I say, which is why we are having a pancake cook-off today right here in the studio.<eos> Now, how are you with a spatula?<eos> And I sure hope no one watching is named Kevin.<eos> Why is that, Pam? Well, apparently, there's not one, but two missing Kevins in the Melbourne area.<eos> Chief Inspector Kevin Yarborough's police cruiser was found abandoned outside his home in Makarra.<eos> Meanwhile, this man, Kevin Garvey, an American holidaying down under, was last seen wandering the road near Kurripa nearly a month ago.<eos> If you have any information on the whereabouts of either of these men, please contact the police.
If you have any information on the whereabouts of either of these men, please contact the police.<eos> Right, let's get to those pancakes!<eos> - Are you ready, Georgie?<eos> - Yes, I am, Pam. Come on over.<eos> Okay, now, tell us about the batter.<eos> Well, we've actually got three batters, George.<eos> The, um... the first one is a plain buttermilk.<eos> That's good.<eos> Yeah, I like the classic pancake myself.<eos> Because you're so boring!
That's good.<eos> Yeah, I like the classic pancake myself.<eos> Because you're so boring!<eos> Aw, that's not all true.<eos> The second one is banana.<eos> - Yum. - That's definitely for me.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Good morning. - Front desk.<eos> Yeah, I need you to turn my television back on right now.
Yeah, I need you to turn my television back on right now.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Durst. I just reset it.<eos> Just give it a few minutes. - "G'Day Melbourne," is that show live?<eos> - Are they shooting it right now? - Yes, sir.<eos> I believe so.<eos> Taxi!<eos> Do you know when the bus is supposed to get here?<eos> Any minute now.<eos> Excuse me, miss?<eos> Are you a mother?
Taxi!<eos> Do you know when the bus is supposed to get here?<eos> Any minute now.<eos> Excuse me, miss?<eos> Are you a mother?<eos> - Yes. - Thank God!<eos> I have a job interview in that cafe.<eos> My sitter didn't show up this morning.<eos> If I go in there with a baby, then they're never gonna hire me.<eos> Could you please watch her?
Should be another one in about 45 minutes.<eos> Please wait! I'll be right back.<eos> Wait!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Discrimination is illegal.<eos> Wait!<eos> Hey! Stop!<eos> Got a man down.<eos> Pancake down...!<eos> Just when I thought you were getting the hang of it.
'Cause I fucking finished this.<eos> So, what do you want?<eos> Did Patti send you?<eos> Who is Patti?<eos> I saw you on my TV.<eos> You were looking right fucking at me.<eos> Everything right?<eos> Yeah. I'm fine.<eos> Is he bothering you, miss?<eos> You could see her?
I know her! I fucking...<eos> Miss Durst.<eos> Go on up. They're waiting for you.<eos> - "Take On Me."<eos> - Ja.<eos> From?<eos> - A-ha.<eos> - A-ha!<eos> Miss Durst.<eos> I am so sorry. I did not hear you come in.
I'm Dr. Eden.<eos> And that is Dr. Bekker.<eos> Hi.<eos> Thank you for coming all this way.<eos> We are sorry about the building. It's a little bit creepy, no?<eos> - What'd she say?<eos> - Don't worry about her.<eos> Um, let's go downstairs, shall we?<eos> This is Bernard.<eos> If you would not mind removing your clothes,
Um, let's go downstairs, shall we?<eos> This is Bernard.<eos> If you would not mind removing your clothes,<eos> Bernard will conduct a brief medical examination.<eos> We have a gown for you.<eos> What kind of medical examination?<eos> It's very routine.<eos> It's noninvasive.<eos> And once you're done, Dr. Bekker and I, we will just ask you a few questions and then we can move on to the next step.<eos> If you're a doctor, why aren't you doing the exam?
Great!<eos> Well, we will see you in a bit.<eos> She was ready to go.<eos> She was ready to go and she wishes she could've told you.<eos> She was ready to go and she wishes she could've told you, but she just couldn't.<eos> It was a stroke.<eos> She was in a coma for three months before he pulled the plug.<eos> Tell him he set her free.<eos> Three months is a long time, man.<eos> And she's grateful that you set her free.
Anemia, glucose, potassium, heavy metals, and pregnancy.<eos> Well, I'm definitely not pregnant.<eos> Right. Your IUD. You'll need to have it removed before you go through.<eos> - We can refer you to a...<eos> - How did you know I had an IUD?<eos> It's in your medical records.<eos> Just gonna affix some sensors for an electrocardiogram.<eos> Would you mind lowering your gown, please?<eos> The event chamber of the device requires an intense period of confinement.<eos> So we're gonna simulate that now while we're monitoring you just to see how well you hold up.

Yeah, she was helping me look for a book.<eos> What book was it?<eos> Um, "Assassins." "Assassins," I think.<eos> The title is "Assassins"?<eos> No. If you call her, she could probably help me.<eos> - We don't have a book by that title.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - No, I know that... I know.<eos> But if you just get ahold of Daniah, then I think she could help me.<eos> So, if you just do that, that'd be fucking great, please.
Leonard?<eos> He's being weird.<eos> That so?<eos> Um, I just... I don't want any trouble. - I was just...<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> Let's take a walk, mate.<eos> I need to get a book that I was looking...<eos> You're leaving.<eos> It's okay, Leonard.<eos> You know this bloke, Danni?

He thinks you're dead.<eos> I have started a new life.<eos> You don't have the right to take that away from me.
Then why are you still using that accent?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> What?<eos> I have compassion for you because you are ill.<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> She told me to tell you that I was who you thought I was and then you'd go away.<eos> Who told you?<eos> This one's on me.<eos> Well, I hope you don't have any expectations because you took me out to dinner, young lady.
Thanks.<eos> Let's have a chat, shall we?<eos> Mr. Linn-Baker enjoyed talking to you in St. Louis.<eos> Where is Mr. Linn-Baker?<eos> He went through.<eos> Through the machine?<eos> - Is it here in this building?<eos> No, it's not here.<eos> I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have about the device, technical or otherwise.<eos> Why haven't you used it?
What about you?<eos> Odds?<eos> All we know for certain is that we are sending people to the exact same destination the others went seven years ago.<eos> The odds that this destination has a sustainable environment with a breathable atmosphere and ample food supply are very, very low, so it is more likely there are 140 million corpses floating out there in space somewhere.<eos> You make it sound so appealing.<eos> Actually, several of our colleagues did go through.<eos> Dr. Van Eeghen, the man who...<eos> The man who designed the device, he was one of the first people to use it.<eos> Yes.<eos> And if you see him, tell him we said hello and that Finland won the World Cup.

Cold feet.<eos> I won't get cold feet.<eos> Good.<eos> So, do you want my money now?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> We have a question for you first.<eos> - Just one.<eos> - You wanna know why I brought Kevin with me.<eos> My boyfriend.<eos> You know everything else about me, so I just figured you'd be worried...

Will it suffer or is it gonna be quick and painless?<eos> Quick and painless.<eos> - Are they mine, the twins?<eos> - Irrelevant.<eos> It's relevant if you want me to answer your fucking question.<eos> They're not yours.<eos> She was working for you.<eos> Sorry?<eos> The woman at the bus stop who gave me her baby. That was a test, right?<eos> We have no idea what you're talking about.
You give me a name, I go to a hotel room, explain what Low Amplitude Denziger Radiation is, and then what? Do I come back here or what?<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm afraid we will not be proceeding any further.<eos> What?<eos> What, did I answer your stupid question wrong?<eos> Ho ho, I get it.<eos> I get it!<eos> You turn me down and then you want me to beg you to take my money, right?
Reverend.<eos> I brought a casserole.<eos> ...islands in the Pacific. And early reports confirm it was uninhabited.<eos> The French government is denying any responsibility, and details surrounding...<eos> - God bless you, Reverend. - Thank you.<eos> ...the person or persons responsible for the launch are not being made available to the international community despite overwhelming pressure for answers.<eos> - How is she?<eos> We've all been praying for her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Arturo, I need you to fly me to Australia.
Arturo, I need you to fly me to Australia.<eos> What?<eos> A cargo plane with the donated food for El Salvador is sitting on the tarmac in Austin, fueled up and ready to go.<eos> I need to get to Melbourne immediately.<eos> I'm asking you to fly me there.<eos> But the explosion.<eos> They said all flights have been grounded.<eos> All nonessential flights.<eos> Military and foreign aid are exempted.<eos> And you, Arturo, are not only a valued member of our congregation, but licensed by an internationally recognized NGO.
How long is the journey there?<eos> 11 hours.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> 11 hours. Not bad, huh?<eos> Unfortunately, tonight's ferry is booked for a private group.<eos> I'm afraid our first available is the day after tomorrow.<eos> No, no, that's too late. We need to get to Melbourne immediately.<eos> This, uh, private group must have a few extra seats.<eos> They bought the boat, sir.<eos> If you wanna get on, I'm afraid you're gonna have to take it up with them.
Hi. Nice to see you girls.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> I know I marked you off.<eos> Right. Hello. How are you today?<eos> I'm 91 and I'm having a son.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> I'm 91 and I'm having a son.<eos> I think she wants you to say something, man.<eos> Uh, what is it you want me to--<eos> - Are you a member of our pride?
He needs our help.<eos> Your boat is the only way we can get to him.<eos> I'm appealing to your sense of charity to let us onboard.<eos> There's gonna be sex on this boat.<eos> There's gonna be a lot of it.<eos> Debased and sinful from port to port, all without judgment.<eos> Is that gonna be all right for you?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, then, why don't you tell me the filthiest joke that you know?
♪ In a circus out of Tijuana... ♪<eos> Terrorism? It was the French.<eos> You think they're starting a war with the English? This is revenge for Agincourt?<eos> Yes, you said that already.<eos> But when will you-- no, no, I'm not at the airport.<eos> If I was at the airport, why would I be calling?<eos> Flights are still grounded.<eos> They refuse to sell tickets over the phone.<eos> I'm gonna go to the snack bar to get some sandwiches.<eos> You want some?
There's still time.<eos> Even if we can't get a flight, we can take this ferry back and Arturo can fly us home.<eos> What?<eos> We're not gonna make it back to Miracle by the 14th, man.<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Well, even if we find Kevin right off the boat, there's no guarantee he's gonna come back with us.<eos> I think we need to accept that whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen here.<eos> We're bringing him home.<eos> He has to be in Miracle.<eos> You two should know that better than anyone.
Can I buy you a drink?<eos> No.<eos> I'd just like a moment alone.<eos> To pray.<eos> Well, we'll be at the bar.<eos> If you can't find us, just look for the orgy.<eos> God speed.<eos> Man overboard!<eos> I saw you.<eos> I saw what you did.
You need to get the ship's manifest and account for every passenger.<eos> Whoever's not on the boat, that's the man I saw go over.<eos> There is no manifest, mate.<eos> Your people bought out the whole boat.<eos> My people?<eos> ! I'm not one of those lunatics.<eos> Listen to me, there's a dangerous man on board.<eos> He's wearing a red hat and calling himself God.<eos> You mean David Burton.<eos> You know him?
Spends most of his time in Tasmania. He's got a little cabin down there.<eos> He's quite a private sort of fella.<eos> Spends a bit of time on the ferry just to be amongst the people.<eos> So he can murder them?<eos> We don't have any other witnesses.<eos> Nobody reported missing.<eos> Well, those sex-crazed maniacs wouldn't notice anyone missing!<eos> Burton walks in here and confesses, I'll be happy to contact the authorities.<eos> We dock in Melbourne in a few hours.<eos> Until then, mate, I suggest you go and find some dry clothes and enjoy the ride.
Until then, mate, I suggest you go and find some dry clothes and enjoy the ride.<eos> You believe me, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Like when I told you I didn't molest my comatose wife?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - What?<eos> - Where's your list?<eos> What?<eos> When we got on the boat, you had a list of your members.
When we got on the boat, you had a list of your members.<eos> - Oh, I don't know.<eos> Somewhere.<eos> One of your people has gone in the water.<eos> We need to find out who he is.<eos> Oh, no, thanks.<eos> You don't care that somebody's been killed?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why would you?

I haven't had any sleep.<eos> We all need to get some rest before we dock.<eos> They've offered me a bed to lie down in in the infirmary.<eos> I- - I think I'll take them up on it.<eos> This is a distraction.<eos> We need to focus on Kevin now.<eos> Where's my book?<eos> I threw it overboard.<eos> It was just getting good.<eos> You know how it ends.

I was just wondering why I haven't been struck down by lightning yet.<eos> Why don't you, uh, transform those ropes into serpents and free yourself?<eos> I don't need to do that.<eos> You're going to untie me once you get what you want.<eos> And what is it I want?<eos> My attention.<eos> I already have your attention.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Not yet?<eos> - Well, you're finally talking to me.

You're agitating him.<eos> Admit what you did.<eos> I've done lots of things.<eos> You threw that man overboard.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Say it.<eos> I threw that man overboard.<eos> You'll tell the captain and the authorities?
You threw that man overboard.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Say it.<eos> I threw that man overboard.<eos> You'll tell the captain and the authorities?<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I'm the authority.<eos> Oh, right, you're the authority on everything-- creation, Isaac and Abraham, the decathlon.
Say it.<eos> I threw that man overboard.<eos> You'll tell the captain and the authorities?<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I'm the authority.<eos> Oh, right, you're the authority on everything-- creation, Isaac and Abraham, the decathlon.<eos> And yet you only won the bronze.<eos> Well, that was before.<eos> Of course.<eos> Because you weren't always God.

Dinosaurs?<eos> The Black Plague?<eos> Mount Everest?<eos> The Mona Lisa?<eos> - The sudden departure?<eos> - Yeah, that was me.<eos> The sudden departure was you?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I could.<eos> You're gonna have to do better than that.
When I was a boy, I was sick.<eos> And I prayed to you to save me, and you did.<eos> Why is it back?<eos> I can save you again.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> Untie me.<eos> Ta-da. You're saved.<eos> Ladies and gents, we will be docking in Melbourne shortly.<eos> Please dispose all rubbish and collect your personal belongings before you disembark.<eos> Thank you for sailing with us. We do hope you enjoyed the voyage.

I'm dying.<eos> What?<eos> David Burton, you are under arrest!
Is that what I should do?<eos> Tell me what to fucking do.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Hey, Pop.<eos> Hey, Lorelei.<eos> What you got there?<eos> Shoes.<eos> It's one hell of a shiner.<eos> You should see the other guy.
So, I got my hands on some of the dog's pain pills.<eos> I popped them and soon realized they were a bit more powerful than the human variety.<eos> So, I passed out hard, and when I wake up, I go outside, and that is the first time I lay eyes upon this young lady.<eos> And she was drowning the police officer?<eos> Whose name is Kevin.<eos> Correct.<eos> It was a horrible mistake, and I will be taking responsibility for what I've done.<eos> I'm not sure she understands.<eos> I understand.<eos> You want to drown Kevin so that he can go to this place where the dead people are.

- Hey, just calm down.<eos> She just shows up. She won't even tell us how she even knew we were here.<eos> You wanna disclose how you got that black eye?<eos> I got it from Nora.<eos> She hit you?<eos> Thought you were supposed to be helping her.<eos> - I did help her.<eos> - And now she's helping us, right?<eos> That's right. That's right.<eos> You wanna give us a hand?
- What?<eos> - They're leaving!<eos> Go down.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You steal this thing?<eos> Said the man who just assaulted an officer of the law.<eos> He'll be fine. I had no choice.<eos> His chief's in a tarp under the goddamn church.<eos> He was heading right for it.<eos> Where are you gonna take him?

My husband, he used to do all the cooking.<eos> I spent years trying to get the stew to taste exactly like his.<eos> I even got it right once.<eos> Then I forgot what I did.<eos> Well, it smells delicious.<eos> Was he a good husband?<eos> Kevin.<eos> He was a great husband.<eos> He saved me.<eos> But you divorced him.
Not much of a last supper.<eos> Well, you certainly cleaned your plate for not liking it.<eos> No, the food is scrumptious.<eos> I'm just saying not much of a last supper without our Jesus.<eos> I think I'm gonna go to lie down for a bit.<eos> Wake me when he comes back.<eos> Truth is, along with our missing fucking savior, we also appear to be short some apostles.<eos> Our friend Matthew conspicuously absent.<eos> Fortunately, I will play the part of Peter.<eos> You are already John.
Also conspicuously absent.<eos> You, Dr. Garvey, are one apostle, and one apostle only.<eos> Thomas.<eos> Doubting Thomas.<eos> When I first started hearing voices back in Mapleton, everyone around me told me I was fucking nuts.<eos> Everyone. Except you.<eos> You were the one person who believed me.<eos> You said those voices were really there.<eos> The next thing I knew... I was locked up in a fucking mental institution.<eos> So you're wrong, Pop.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Got your lighter.<eos> You can keep it. I quit.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Is Nora gone?<eos> We're all gone.<eos> Bye, Laurie.<eos> Goodbye, Kevin.<eos> Far out as I can take you with that storm rolling in.<eos> If you're gonna go, you best go now.
Now the goddamn flood's coming, and we're all gonna fucking die.<eos> - His horse is here. - Huh? - His horse is here.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ!<eos> Help me!<eos> Get him out!<eos> Get him the fuck out!<eos> Get him off, God damn it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> - What are you doing?
Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> I'm doing what you asked me to do.<eos> I thought we'd do it together.<eos> I know what you want me to say to Evie.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No. My children.<eos> You saw the photos. Do you remember their names?
The fuck are these?<eos> Uh, my sunglasses.<eos> No reflective surfaces.<eos> Do not look into them no matter what.<eos> That's how they found you.<eos> Yeah. Right.<eos> "He stood on the bow of The Merciful... the water endlessly stretching to the infinite horizon as he contemplated the impossible distance between them, but he would not stop until he found her."<eos> What, are you writing a book?<eos> There's no shame in it.<eos> What you do in your time is your business.
Unfortunately, folks in your line of work don't get to retire.<eos> I'm an assassin.<eos> Yes, sir, Mr. Harvey.<eos> So, let's get assassinating, shall we?<eos> Who's the target?<eos> President.<eos> - The president?<eos> - Of the United States.<eos> And based on our intel, in, well, just under two hours he's gonna start an unsanctioned nuclear war.<eos> And you are the only man alive who can get to him before he does.

Okay. What?<eos> I need to find some people.<eos> Five kids...<eos> Liam, Abigail, Samantha, David, and Jimmy Playford.<eos> I also need to talk to a woman named Evangeline Murphy and a man... Christopher Sunday.<eos> Christopher Sunday?<eos> The Prime Minister of Australia?<eos> Man, you want that kind of high-level access, you're gonna have to talk to the boss yourself.<eos> Here. Stick that in your ear.<eos> You'll hear him, he'll hear you.

I have to... I have to talk to that girl.<eos> No, we haven't got time for that, sir.<eos> We need to get you to a secure location.<eos> I'm not going fucking anywhere until I talk to that girl.<eos> Okay, I'll get her.<eos> Get him to the car.<eos> This way, please, sir.<eos> Mr. President, Chief of Staff on the phone.<eos> - Mr. President, it appears Ukrainian separatists have taken control of an armed nuclear submarine, and they'll have launch capability within two hours.<eos> You're being brought to a bunker, which you will access with your unique biometrics once inside.
Yeah, that would be ridiculous.<eos> Sir, do I have your permission to move us to DEFCON 2?<eos> Um, what DEFCON are we at right now?<eos> - We're at DEFCON 3, sir.<eos> - Uh, DEFCON 2 is worse?<eos> Yes, sir, it's worse.<eos> Let's jut stay where we're at right now until we have more, um, intel.<eos> With all due respect, sir, I don't think the Secretary of Defense is going to be happy about that.<eos> Yeah, well, fuck the Secretary of Defense.<eos> Mr. President, the girl you asked for.
Looks like rain.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Do you know that I'm not the President of the United States?<eos> I sure do.<eos> I have a message for you from your father.<eos> My father?<eos> John.<eos> He wants me to tell you... he wants you to know... that you're loved.<eos> Is there anything you want me to tell him?<eos> Are you fucking serious?
Is there anything you want me to tell him?<eos> Are you fucking serious?<eos> My father was murdered... my mother, my brother... all of them gone in an instant because of a drone strike ordered by your administration.<eos> No. N-no, that's not what happened.<eos> You were killed.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not dead.<eos> I'm right fucking here, asshole.<eos> You said you knew that I wasn't the president.<eos> You're not! You're just a puppet.

They didn't know what happened to their shoes.<eos> Did you get the song?<eos> I was working on it.<eos> Why'd you pull me out of the pond? There is no pond.<eos> The whole fucking ranch is flooded.<eos> Take me to the bathroom.<eos> Whoa, hold on. You can't keep doing this.<eos> - Yes, he can.<eos> - No, look at him!<eos> You got what you wanted. Now you're worried about him?
I love you, too.<eos> You're gonna have to hold me down.<eos> You all right, sir?<eos> I need to talk to the Australian prime minister.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - The Australian prime minister.<eos> Christopher Sunday.<eos> I need to talk to him right now.<eos> Well, sir, there's a secure comms room inside the bunker.<eos> We just need to confirm your ID, and you can talk to whoever you want.
Correct.<eos> Good to see you, Mr. President.<eos> I wish the circumstances were different, but it appears the shit has hit the fan, sir.<eos> Let's get to the situation room.<eos> Mr. President, for reasons I cannot fathom, we remain at DEFCON 3.<eos> This is the case containing the nuclear football, which will give you remote launch capability.<eos> What's in that one?<eos> Never mind about that.<eos> Just pray we don't have to open it.<eos> Sir, in order to arm the device, you need to verbally take us down to DEFCON 1.

Let her in.<eos> Yes, sir, of course.<eos> Madam Vice President.<eos> You're being played, sir.<eos> - Wha... what?<eos> - You're being played.<eos> I just got off the phone with the Kremlin who confirms that there is no submarine, no separatists.<eos> This is a smoke screen. You have been fed bogus intel.<eos> I don't get fed, I feed.<eos> And you clearly have no goddamn idea what's happening around here.

It's the seventh anniversary of the departure, and there is reasonable expectation out there that the world's gonna end.<eos> So, we're gonna fire our nukes at the Russians and they're gonna retaliate, and then that's it.<eos> We're all torched.<eos> No one wakes up tomorrow disappointed that nothing fucking happened.<eos> We give the people what they're too chickenshit to do themselves, what they elected us for.<eos> We give them what they want.<eos> And they want to die.<eos> Well, that's not gonna work.<eos> You can't launch without going through the Fisher Protocol.<eos> You know about the Fisher Protocol?
And they want to die.<eos> Well, that's not gonna work.<eos> You can't launch without going through the Fisher Protocol.<eos> You know about the Fisher Protocol?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Prove it.<eos> It's an ethical deterrent.<eos> The nuclear launch key was surgically embedded into the heart of a volunteer.<eos> In order for the president to be able to blow up millions of people with the push of a button, he has to extract that key by murdering the volunteer himself.<eos> But since I don't see that volunteer here, you can't launch shit.

I told you I had to make a fucking call!<eos> Do you have eyes on the entrance?<eos> - Yeah, I see it.<eos> - Good.<eos> Take out the Secret Service agents and get in there.<eos> There are no Secret Service agents.<eos> It's a trap. They want me to go in.<eos> They wanna cut me open.<eos> Do you think I don't know that?<eos> Well, if you knew that, why the fuck wouldn't you tell me?

Down! Down on the stairs.<eos> Get down! Show us your hands!<eos> - Show us your fucking hands!<eos> - Here! - Don't move.<eos> - Did you fucking sell me out?<eos> Don't you fucking move.<eos> Hey, are you there?<eos> I said don't fucking move!<eos> Jesus.<eos> You look just fucking like him.
I said don't fucking move!<eos> Jesus.<eos> You look just fucking like him.<eos> The president is in the situation room.<eos> It's in lockdown, but the code is 6969.<eos> And please make sure you fucking kill the Secretary of Defense.<eos> - Where's the comms room?<eos> - What? The comms room. I need to make a call.<eos> Do you know what's inside of you?<eos> Yes. Then you know that the president will not hesitate to cut you open and pull it out.
They're all liars.<eos> They say they don't believe in love and they don't feel pain.<eos> I feel pain.<eos> And I'm in love. I'm in love with the most wonderful man I have ever known.<eos> Uh-huh. And who's that?<eos> His name is God.<eos> Tell her I love her, too.<eos> Where's the comms room?<eos> What is it with you and the fucking comms room?<eos> I thought you were an assassin.

I need to talk to the Prime Minister of Australia.<eos> Christopher Sunday.<eos> Is there a problem, Officer?<eos> No, sir.<eos> He'll come out here, Mr. President.<eos> - Give us the room.<eos> - Sir, this is my post.<eos> Give us the fucking room.<eos> Hello. Are you Christopher Sunday?<eos> My name is Kevin, and I know this is gonna sound crazy... but you're not the Prime Minister of Australia.
A song to stop the rain.<eos> There's no song to stop the rain.<eos> What?<eos> I told your father, but he didn't listen.<eos> Look, you have to give me something.<eos> I have to bring him something. He... he needs this.<eos> - There's a flood...<eos> Believe what?<eos> Do you believe your father can sing a song and stop the flood?<eos> Then why are you here?
Okay.<eos> Begin.

I meant in your statement.<eos> Would you like to try again?<eos> Okay.<eos> My name is Nora Elizabeth Jamison Durst.<eos> I was born on November 18th, 1979.<eos> This is a copy of today's paper, because today is the day I'm leaving to be with them.<eos> I'm leaving to be with my children,<eos> Erin and Jeremy.<eos> I'm ready to go now.<eos> We prefer to give a more thorough orientation, but since we were in the process of moving on, you'll just have to bear with us.

Once you are inside, you will see the event chamber at the far end.<eos> You just walk to it.<eos> You may experience nausea or discomfort as you pass by the undulating laser array while it cycles up.<eos> Do not touch the array.<eos> Step inside the event chamber, close the exit port behind you, and turn the latch to the left. Hard to the left.<eos> It'll stick. Then pull your knees towards your chest and hold them there.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> We will be monitoring you from inside there.<eos> Once inside the event chamber, you will be able to hear us and we will be able to hear you.

Hi, Matt.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> We're going to begin, Nora.<eos> I was worried you'd forgotten.<eos> Don't usually get so many so close together.<eos> Love is in the air.<eos> A little extra for your trouble.<eos> Sarah, does the name Kevin mean anything to you?<eos> Are you sure?
I called you because I thought you told him where I was.<eos> Come on, you know I didn't tell him that.<eos> You called me because you wanted me to say it's okay to go to the dance.<eos> I do not want to go to the fucking dance!<eos> Gotcha.<eos> But if you did, it's okay.<eos> Jesus Christ, Laurie.<eos> Same time next week?<eos> Where are your beads?<eos> - Excuse me? - Your beads. You need beads.
Release the birds!<eos> What did you write?<eos> That's for me to know and some lonely Eskimo to find out.<eos> Isn't that romantic?<eos> Yeah, let's hear it for the love birds!<eos> See, if only life was just about love.<eos> But it's about temptation.<eos> It's about failure.<eos> It's about weakness.<eos> You know what I'm talking about, don't you, Sister?
The man I just saw leaving.<eos> You mean Father Brian. He's the only man permitted in the convent.<eos> Does Father Brian ride a motorcycle?<eos> - Well, this man did.<eos> And he was climbing a ladder down from that room right up there.<eos> Well, that's strange.<eos> Is that your room?<eos> It might be.<eos> But I certainly haven't seen any men on ladders.<eos> You just had sex with him.
Is that your room?<eos> It might be.<eos> But I certainly haven't seen any men on ladders.<eos> You just had sex with him.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - You did.<eos> - Did not. - Then swear to God.<eos> All right.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> I saw you dancing with that man. That man you said you didn't know.
It's sort of a Mrs. Doubtfire situation.<eos> I told you to stop calling me.<eos> Look, you think I really want to be wasting my prison phone time on you?<eos> I could be calling a joke hotline.<eos> The divorce papers are in the mail.<eos> Sign 'em and get 'em back to me.<eos> Why do we even have to go through this?<eos> There's no way that marriage was legal.<eos> And now, in the name of me,<eos> Gosh Almighty, who you may know from, I don't know, Italian ceilings?
Medical results, rejected Costco applications, vanity plates you ordered while intoxicated.<eos> You don't even have a car, Titus!<eos> No, this is good.<eos> I sign these stupid divorce papers, and I'm done with the Reverend forever.<eos> Don't sign anything until you have someone with glasses look at it.<eos> I made that mistake once. That's why I have to go to that Army base four weeks a year.<eos> Wait a minute. Why are you still here?<eos> Have you not seen Mikey since you've been back?<eos> I probably have.<eos> You people all look the same to me.
I miss you so much, Russ.<eos> Why do you have to go to Africa and fight rhino poaching anyway?<eos> Who cares how rhinos are cooked?<eos> When he gets back, let's go on a double date.<eos> You, Russ, me, and someone we trick.<eos> The call dropped again.<eos> Get it together, Africa.<eos> Jacqueline, can you look at these?<eos> Divorce papers.<eos> From... you-know-who.
But then he was gone, gone forever!<eos> Did you just get these today?<eos> You're not signing this.<eos> But the sticker says "Sign here." It's shaped like an arrow.<eos> Kimmy, this man put you through hell... cheating on you or whatever.<eos> -He kidnapped me.<eos> -I said, "Or whatever."<eos> But now he wants something from you, right?<eos> A divorce so he can get remarried.<eos> Which means now you're the one in control.

And, yes, we are still in touch.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because I know you, Titus Andromedon.<eos> I know how weak you are in the face of adversity, how easily you give up.<eos> Only when it comes to stuff.<eos> So I'm going to tell you where to find Lonny Dufrene every morning before work.<eos> Tomorrow at 7:00 a.m., you can find Mr. Dufrene in Riverside Park at 78th Street, doing an exercise class.<eos> Places!<eos> Great. So, when I want him to call, he suddenly can't be bothered.<eos> Text and tell him you've been in an accident.
And it was worse than I could have imagined.<eos> No. He killed you, and now you're a ghost?<eos> I don't want to make sexy pottery with you.<eos> No, he just said, "Bye-bye," and walked away, like it was nothing.<eos> I'll be on the stoop, throwing stuff at anyone who looks like they're in love.<eos> Hang on.<eos> You're going to bed?<eos> It's 9:00.<eos> You're gonna miss the parade of Puerto Rican babies who are up too late.<eos> Well, you'll have to tell me about it.
Where you?<eos> No, no, no. This isn't my phone.<eos> I'm trying to call Kimmy.<eos> No!<eos> Here come accident!<eos> You're talking to K-Biz.<eos> Allah, be praised, K-Biz.<eos> You got your phone back.<eos> It was hard to track down 'cause I went to so many places today.<eos> I just love walking wherever I want, don't you?
Opening unlocked doors and going outside and then showering alone and not having a toilet next to my bed.<eos> Are you listening to yourself? You know I'm in prison.<eos> Everything that you just said is fun stuff I can't do now.<eos> Tell you what- - I'll take you to that go-kart place.<eos> My God, normally, that's, like, my favorite thing!<eos> It's about time you called.<eos> Well, excuse me, Kimmy. But a condom full of heroin exploded in my stomach, so this whole day has been for the birds!<eos> I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do with these divorce papers.<eos> Just fill them out!<eos> It's just, you know how you always said in the bunker that women are dumb?
Get really low.<eos> Hey, it's me, man, Lonny Dufrene.<eos> I had, like, a far out idea for the new Gordon--<eos> Titus Andromedon.<eos> I bet he's never heard of you either, lady!<eos> I mean, cool, cool.<eos> The '70s...<eos> Let's schedule him first up and, have a nice selection of pastries for him.<eos> Nothing with fruit.<eos> Okay, maybe I'll sign if you admit that there was no fifth Mole Woman and you were Lil' Lisa.
I wish I had gotten my degree.<eos> Back before Julian, I went for a year, but ran out of money.<eos> Trump University. Go, Pricks!<eos> Well, good thing I have $2,000 saved... plus a pretty rare Beanie Baby that I would never sell because his face is too cute.<eos> Two thousand dollars?<eos> Kimmy, even a state school costs $20,000... a year.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> How am I gonna get my pockets fat with that kind of cheddar, fam?<eos> Well, you could always get yourself a rich husband.

- Grimes and I are the only ones left.<eos> - _ Three people had access to our new names:<eos> the directors of CIA, NSA and CTU, which is now Keith Mullins.<eos> You're the one who chose me as your replacement.<eos> You need to trust me to do the job.<eos> Rebecca, what is this?<eos> Is Rebecca having second thoughts about giving up her career?<eos> You're gonna make a great First Lady.<eos> _ Maybe part of her doesn't want you to win and have everything change.<eos> You're overstepping.
I want to get into the CTU's subnetwork to find out who accessed the Rangers' files.<eos> To do that, I need your director's override.<eos> My override?<eos> Once I identify the leak, I can track them back to the people behind this.<eos> Keith, killing the Rangers is only the beginning.<eos> These people are planning attacks against this country.<eos> I have no way of verifying what you're telling me, but, what?<eos> I'm supposed to give you unfettered access to the system?<eos> Why would I make all this up?<eos> Do you really think I want to be doing this?
Andy, will you be able to find the leak or not?<eos> Yes, but I don't know how long it'll take.<eos> Carter? Ben went into the storm drains at First and Pierce.<eos> The city doesn't have any cameras down there.<eos> And there are literally thousands of exit points.<eos> Yeah, Ben knows that.<eos> He's been doing this a while.<eos> This is him.<eos> I'm gonna join you in.<eos> Listen, Ben barely trusts me so he can't know you're on, okay?
Senator.<eos> All right, gentlemen.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> How are you?<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> How are you? Hi.<eos> We should, uh, talk to the staff about Rebecca not being able to come.<eos> We should all be on the same page.<eos> - I'll get right on it, Senator.<eos> - Hey, good to see you, Senator. - Joe, I'm glad you could make it.

Yeah. We got those CEOs to blink, but trust me, in November, we're going to have 'em on the run.<eos> - Senator.<eos> - Hey, Cathy.<eos> - Hello. - Don't you worry, I promise I am going to push that through, even if I have to haul that committee into chambers myself.

I know what you want... because you and me, we want the same thing.<eos> Isaac. Why are you worrying about Isaac?<eos> He treats you like a little bitch.<eos> He is still running things.<eos> What if he wasn't?<eos> What if I said, I got a way for you to get what's yours?<eos> Okay, okay, I had enough of that when your mom was alive, come on.<eos> If this is about, uh, Rebecca not coming, we were able to tweak the speech.<eos> No, no. It's not about that.<eos> You asked me to do a little recon for you with some of my old media contacts.
It wouldn't be the first lie coming out of that campaign.<eos> We checked it out, John.<eos> There are photos that prove that she was there.<eos> During her sophomore year.<eos> Show me.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> She was young.<eos> Yeah. Still...<eos> Well son, I don't know what else to tell you, except, she's a liability.<eos> John, bottom line is, you will not win in November if you have a campaign manager who prayed for the death of American soldiers.
Move.<eos> Here, you tie him up.<eos> Take this thing off my back.<eos> - When I'm done.<eos> You keep doing what I say<eos> - and you'll walk away from this.<eos> Make transcripts available to the press and if anyone asks about Rebecca Ingram's absence just refer them to me.<eos> Nilaa. Can you excuse us for a moment?<eos> Gage's campaign is releasing an attack ad tomorrow... about you.<eos> About you attending the Parkland Mosque.
It made me sick that some crackpot imam was spewing that kind of hatred and violence in the name of Islam.<eos> I went to tell everyone there he was distorting our religion.<eos> And you can prove that?<eos> Even if I could, the damage is done, but it's the truth.<eos> I wanted to tell you, I did.<eos> I guess I just convinced myself it happened so long ago no one would ever find out.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I will, uh, I'll draft my letter of resignation and explain how I kept...<eos> I won't accept your resignation.<eos> It's true you should have told me... but it's also true that I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.

If we get ahead of this, we can minimize the damage.<eos> Who knows? Maybe even turn it into an advantage.<eos> Gage will just keep playing the national security card.<eos> Oh, Rebecca could help us out there.<eos> - You'll still take a hit.

Uh, hey, Tom.<eos> - Keith asked me to tell you to submit your debrief in writing this time.<eos> Yeah, but he and Rebecca are still going over case files.<eos> I guess it's taking them longer than they thought, huh?<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Uh, Tom. I texted you... about getting together to maybe, you know, clear the air.<eos> There's no air that needs clearing.<eos> We have nothing to talk about Andy.<eos> Agent Locke, uh, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Sorry, who are you again?

Been here two weeks.<eos> Uh, look, I don't think Andy told you the truth about Director Mullins.<eos> What are you talking about?
Got it.<eos> The computer the Rangers' identities were accessed from belongs to Mizrani, first name Nilaa.<eos> My husband's campaign manager.<eos> We were pulled offline.<eos> I can't get back on the server.<eos> They know.<eos> They cut our outfeed.<eos> I'm not looping the evidence room feed anymore.<eos> Carter, we're shut down.<eos> You need to get out of there now.
You'll never get out of there alive.<eos> Okay, feeding in the loops.<eos> Go.<eos> - We were pulled off-line.<eos> - They know.<eos> Keith, we're running an operation.<eos> If you shut us...<eos> You're not running anything!<eos> Lock them in interrogation now.<eos> Rebecca, can you hear me? !
You're not running anything!<eos> Lock them in interrogation now.<eos> Rebecca, can you hear me? !<eos> Can anyone hear me? !<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Rebecca respects you.<eos> It's not about not trusting you.<eos> She had no choice.<eos> Once she confirmed you weren't the breach, she was relieved.
His story syncs up with Rebecca's.<eos> They could be covering for each other.<eos> According to his autonomic indicators, he's telling the truth.<eos> Perp managed to get his hands on a gun.<eos> He took Vernon and Bates hostage before they could process him.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Name's Eric Carter.<eos> Mr. Carter!<eos> This is Commander George Marx.<eos> Tell me if you can hear me.

But if you want your men alive, you stay out!<eos> Nobody's doing anything.<eos> Let's just keep talking, okay?<eos> Tell me what you want.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Mr. Carter?<eos> What's on the other side of this wall?<eos> It's only a matter of time before they come busting through that door.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Listen, whatever you think you know about me, you don't.
Now, he's up to speed on everything.<eos> He knows you need to get Grimes the money as soon as possible, so I'm gonna put him on.<eos> Carter, the police are giving you a vehicle and a comm package.<eos> A CTU tac team will follow you to your rendezvous with Grimes.<eos> But they won't make any moves until they confirm Grimes has the list of sleepers.<eos> No.<eos> Ben told me to come alone.<eos> He spots anyone he even thinks might be with the government, he will bolt.<eos> I'll make sure the tac team stays hidden.<eos> You're not hearing me.
Take Agent Fox with you.<eos> - Thank you. - Yeah.<eos> According to Carter, the list of sleepers is on a USB flash drive.<eos> We can't move in until we confirm Grimes has it.<eos> Give me a second.<eos> I'm sorry I've been shutting you out.<eos> Look, I'm not happy about the way things ended.<eos> Things didn't just end.<eos> You ended them.<eos> I need everyone to close the projects you're working on and listen up.
I'm sorry, John.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> We're ready.<eos> She's in here.<eos> I had them set up video and audio before they sequestered her.<eos> Your guests are expecting you outside, you should get back to them.<eos> No.<eos> I-I need to see this.<eos> Do you know why I asked to talk to you?<eos> I'm waiting for you to tell me.
Take a seat.<eos> I'd rather stand.<eos> Over the last few hours, terrorists killed four of the Rangers who took out Bin-Khalid.<eos> This is a copy of my server log.<eos> The highlighted subroutine contains the wit-sec information on those Rangers.<eos> It was accessed 25 days ago at 6:05 a.m. from your I.P. address.<eos> Nilaa, we've known each other a long time.<eos> I don't want this to be you, so help me understand.<eos> Who are you working with?<eos> First Gage tries linking me to some radical mosque, and now you're calling me a terrorist?

First Gage tries linking me to some radical mosque, and now you're calling me a terrorist?<eos> Well, it wasn't me.<eos> You need to do better than that.<eos> I wasn't at campaign headquarters then.<eos> I take a run every morning at 6:00, right after I pray.<eos> I never miss either one when I'm in D.C.<eos> Show me your route.<eos> We'll see if we can confirm it.<eos> Mr. Harris?<eos> You said I could come by to go over my test.
You said I could come by to go over my test.<eos> She'll go away.<eos> Not if she heard the faucet.<eos> Mr. Harris?<eos> Hold on, I'm-I'm coming.<eos> Wait!<eos> Hey, Grace, uh, sorry, I-I completely spaced.<eos> I'm working with another, uh, student right now.<eos> So maybe we can do this tomorrow.<eos> Are you all right, Mr. Harris?
With your support in November, we'll be...<eos> Keep checking traffic cams, surveillance from local businesses, anything that could prove Nilaa was out running when she said she was.<eos> Henry. So, you just slip in after the party's already started, and then disappear behind closed doors without so much as a "hello"?<eos> - Hello. - Mm.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Now, don't be sorry.<eos> Just tell me what the hell's going on.<eos> There was a situation at CTU.<eos> And this, um, situation, did it have something to do with my son's campaign manager?<eos> Henry, you know I can't talk about this.
I go to the hospital, and I can try to finish this.<eos> Go back and finish the compound.<eos> My brother's waiting.<eos> Excuse me, excuse me.<eos> I'm his girlfriend.<eos> I'd like to travel with him to the hospital.<eos> - Climb in.<eos> - Okay.<eos> There were no cameras along your route.<eos> No way to confirm you were out running when you said you were.

No problem. - God bless.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> My guy was able to hack the ATM camera, change the time stamp.<eos> Rebecca's already pulled the footage, and she has a record that Nilaa was at campaign headquarters when her file was breached.<eos> And there are no other cameras?<eos> There's no way that CTU can confirm Nilaa's story?<eos> I went over the route myself, twice.<eos> CTU won't be able to trace the leak back to you.<eos> That's what you said the first time.

They got these lakes made by glaciers.<eos> They're deep and ice-cold.<eos> It's like a shock to your system.<eos> You ever swim in glacier water?<eos> No.<eos> I always thought I could settle down in a place like this.<eos> Looks like a nice place, Ben.<eos> Then you should come. You should come.<eos> You should bring Nicole.<eos> You two could get a fresh start.
- I'm fine.<eos> Down the stairs.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> They got the list.<eos> Carter, where are you?<eos> The hostiles have the list.<eos> I'm headed into the tunnel.<eos> Carter, we didn't catch that.<eos> Say again. They just entered the exit stairwell.<eos> Confirm you're getting this!
Just give me the list, and we're done.<eos> I have four potential hostiles.<eos> You lied to me!<eos> Someone used my proprietary code to access the file identifying the rangers who took out bin-Khalid.<eos> The file was accessed from Nilaa's computer.<eos> She may be facilitating a terrorist attack on domestic soil.<eos> My guy was able to hack the ATM camera, change the time stamp.<eos> Rebecca's already pulled the footage.<eos> CTU won't be able to trace the leak back to you.<eos> You said you were out running that morning, but here you are entering the office.

What happened?<eos> We don't know.<eos> We just saw him lying here.<eos> Somebody help!<eos> The terrorists, they...<eos> They got away with the list.<eos> I don't know how many times I can say it.<eos> I didn't leak the identity of those rangers.<eos> I saw that ATM footage.<eos> You say you were out there jogging, but it shows you at the exact place at the exact moment when the data on those rangers was stolen.

What am I supposed to think?<eos> If you were in my shoes, what would you think?<eos> Rebecca's told me that these terrorists are planning attacks.<eos> Attacks that could kill thousands of people.<eos> Nilaa, you help us stop this, and I will do everything I can...<eos> Just leave me alone.<eos> Nilaa... Please just go!<eos> Talk to me!<eos> Please, I just said, go.<eos> I am not going anywhere until you tell me the truth.

Yeah, well, guess his father's death gave him a change of heart.<eos> Hey, have you gotten anywhere with Nilaa Mizrani?<eos> Not yet. My husband's speaking with her.<eos> I thought a personal appeal might get her to open up.<eos> Well, right now, she's our best hope to stop Jadalla from activating those sleeper cells.<eos> I want her back at CTU. We'll work on her there.<eos> Okay.<eos> On my way.<eos> With me.<eos> You're coming with us to CTU.

Attacks may already be underway.<eos> I'm speaking with the president in ten minutes.<eos> He's gonna want a worst-case scenario, so let's have it.<eos> I'll let Rebecca respond.<eos> Bin-Khalid's goal was to implant a network of sleeper cells consisting of homegrown sympathizers and foreign operatives entering the country under false identities.<eos> 15 to 20 cells, each with a specific target.<eos> This is footage from the Al-Jegrad market in Alexandria, Egypt, three years ago.<eos> The attack was planned and executed by bin-Khalid and his men.<eos> Over 200 people lost their lives, including 18 Americans.<eos> You're saying this is what we can expect here?
You being here, it... It means so much.<eos> Mrs. Phelps?<eos> I'm Dr. Edwards.<eos> Your son's stable.<eos> He's had a pretty bad head injury.<eos> Neurology's looking at him now.<eos> But signs are positive.<eos> Sir?<eos> Yeah, Ryan?<eos> You asked me to run background, on the ad that was gonna air about Nilaa and that radical mosque.
But signs are positive.<eos> Sir?<eos> Yeah, Ryan?<eos> You asked me to run background, on the ad that was gonna air about Nilaa and that radical mosque.<eos> What'd you find?<eos> A local news story from five years ago, about a speech the imam gave at that mosque.<eos> He's saying some pretty outrageous things.<eos> Which is hardly news.<eos> Senator, Nilaa was there, protesting the speech, just like she claimed.<eos> You're certain about this?

Fight them!<eos> Do not accept them as your friend and your ally!<eos> The prophet Muhammad had Christians and Jews as his allies.<eos> Ben and I would go in together.<eos> If we make contact with Gabriel, we'll see if he knows how to find Jadalla bin-Khalid.<eos> Why limit the operation to you and grimes?<eos> If he really knows Gabriel's location, why not go in hard, send in a TAC team?<eos> Because if Gabriel is not on site, then we've shown our hand.<eos> We'll never find him.<eos> On what pretext would you and grimes make this approach?
Eric, your friend is asking for highly classified weapons schematics that he could sell for millions of dollars.<eos> With all due respect, doesn't this sound familiar?<eos> Rebecca...<eos> I looked Ben in the eye.<eos> And I honestly believe that he is trying to redeem himself, that he is telling me the truth.<eos> How sure of that can you be?<eos> I can't.<eos> Okay, not-not completely.<eos> But right now, this is the only play that we have.<eos> Unless someone else can tell me that you have any other leads.
Unless someone else can tell me that you have any other leads.<eos> Well, we just got the all-agency report.<eos> No one has anything actionable, across the board.<eos> So maybe this is worth trying.<eos> Fortunately, it's not your call, Andy.<eos> I'll double- check the intel on Gabriel, analyze digital forensics on arms transactions...<eos> No! All your technology didn't save my ranger squad.<eos> We have a location on Gabriel and a way in.<eos> We don't need another one of your analysis, Mullins, we need boots on the ground!<eos> Carter, you're an army ranger, you're not a CTU agent.

We can still save this.<eos> How?<eos> I told him everything.<eos> You'll deny it.<eos> Unless he was wearing a wire...<eos> There is no hard evidence linking you or me to anything.<eos> And whatever they do at CTU, you hold your mud, and we'll get through this.<eos> And so will John.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> If that were true, you wouldn't be here with me.

The terrorists got away with the list.<eos> One of the men was Jadalla, Bin-Khalid's son.<eos> We have the list.<eos> It's a sign we're on a righteous path.<eos> Rebecca, the list of sleeper cells... the terrorists have it.<eos> - My God.<eos> - Have you gotten anywhere with Nilaa Mizrani?<eos> Right now, she's our best hope to stop Jadalla from activating<eos> - those sleeper cells.<eos> - You're coming with us to CTU.

God knows how many people could be lost if Jadalla Bin-Khalid launches those attacks.<eos> - I can fix this, Eric.<eos> - What?<eos> I can fix this.<eos> I can make it right.<eos> You ever heard of an arms smuggler goes by the name Gabriel?<eos> He's a ghost.<eos> I can get us to him.<eos> See if he knows where Bin-Khalid's people are,<eos> Carter, you're an Army Ranger...
- Exactly what we talked about.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You better be telling me the truth about Gabriel.<eos> I am.<eos> 'Cause if you're not, I'm-a kill you myself.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> We took a closer look at the security tape from campaign headquarters.<eos> It looks as if it may have been tampered with.<eos> You mean it was faked.

- No. No, Isaac!<eos> Isaac, no!<eos> No, please!<eos> Please...<eos> Please, Isaac!<eos> No, you got to believe me!<eos> No! Please.<eos> - Please!<eos> - The rest of y'all, get your phones out, right?<eos> I want to know who you been talking to.
You think anybody here wouldn't kill to get out like you did?<eos> We don't have that choice.<eos> We're here.<eos> Trying to do what we got to do, but...<eos> Look.<eos> I'm asking you to talk to him.<eos> And say what?<eos> I've never seen him like this before.<eos> That's 'cause he wasn't like this when you and Eric were around.<eos> Once you two bounced, everything changed.
He was arrested two weeks ago trying to plant a bomb in Grozny Square.<eos> The police never got anything out of him.<eos> But in the village, people talk.<eos> There were rumors he trained in Pakistan.<eos> That he wasn't alone.<eos> You were there with him.<eos> Tell me what you're doing here.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I told you don't lie to me.<eos> Tell me what you two have done.
Bind his wrists. Bind his wrists.<eos> Don't let your brother control you.<eos> I raised you to be better.<eos> It's your father, Amira!<eos> Amira! Please.<eos> What are you going to do to him?<eos> We just got to the staging area Carter gave us.<eos> Team's ready to go when we get the signal.<eos> Copy.<eos> You wanted to see me?

He brought me those.<eos> These real?<eos> - I took them from DoD myself.<eos> - Where's the rest?<eos> - Locked with an access code.<eos> - So unlock it.<eos> Only for the guy who can<eos> - green light the deal.<eos> - Gabriel.<eos> If you're screwing with me, I promise you I will splatter your brains all over this asphalt.
I just need to know we're on the same page.<eos> Kill him.<eos> Then we can talk.<eos> Ben and I fought together.<eos> And we swore an oath<eos> - to our country<eos> - No. and to each other.<eos> I'm not doing it.<eos> No, Eric, no.<eos> You might want to reconsider.
I would just like to understand what's going on.<eos> Why John would do this to me.<eos> I know he's told you some story about my working with terrorists, but<eos> I swear to you, I don't have the least clue what he's talking about.<eos> But I keep going over it in my head.<eos> I know that John is under pressure.<eos> I don't know, maybe he overheard a conversation I had, misinterpreted something,<eos> I just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You told John you gave the identities of the Army Rangers to Jadalla Bin-Khalid

! I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Tell her the truth!<eos> - Son of a bitch!<eos> - John?<eos> Don't.<eos> You should leave.<eos> Looks like you check out.<eos> It's a good thing.<eos> Give me the phone.<eos> So how do you know they're genuine?
Don't.<eos> You should leave.<eos> Looks like you check out.<eos> It's a good thing.<eos> Give me the phone.<eos> So how do you know they're genuine?<eos> Because I know where I stole them from.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> What's to stop me killing you, keeping the plans anyway?<eos> Someone who I trust... told me you were a stand-up guy.
Seven, Alpha, Tango,<eos> Four, Four, Hotel, Six, Two.<eos> Yeah, it looks like the real deal.<eos> I'll have to have someone authenticate them.<eos> Yeah. Of course.<eos> Move.<eos> Don't.<eos> Put your hands behind your head and move over there.<eos> Hands above your head now.<eos> You have a gun around your waist.

Of course.<eos> Move.<eos> Don't.<eos> Put your hands behind your head and move over there.<eos> Hands above your head now.<eos> You have a gun around your waist.<eos> Put it on the floor and slide it over to me, slowly.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You sold guns to a terrorist named Jadalla Bin-Khalid.

I don't understand.<eos> An activation code was sent out.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> The sleeper cell who's information we received from the list.<eos> Someone in our system sent out the code.<eos> - I swear it wasn't me.<eos> - Can you stop it?<eos> No.<eos> It's been encrypted.<eos> You did this?
There's nothing to think about.<eos> We've gotten the activation code.<eos> _<eos> We're launching the attack.<eos> - No. Khasan...<eos> - Call Harris.<eos> Tell him to be here with the rest of the material.<eos> - Khasan?<eos> - Do it right away! Now!<eos> You should know, I don't do business with terrorists.

Now!<eos> You should know, I don't do business with terrorists.<eos> I'm a patriot.<eos> So those modified semis that you sell...<eos> Jadalla just found them lying around?<eos> You'd have to ask him about that.
How can this be a great war if it makes us do this to our own father?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Maybe we should think about this.<eos> We've gotten the activation code.<eos> We're launching the attack.<eos> You told John you gave the identities of the Army Rangers to Jadalla Bin-Khalid.
I need to know where they are.<eos> Carter, it's Locke.<eos> I got Gabriel.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> This may be our only lead.<eos> All right, Tech's still scrolling through the hard drive's data.<eos> If we find something.<eos> Copy that.<eos> You steal classified missile specs to use as bait. Draw out Gabriel, only for him to end up dead before we can question him?

Okay?<eos> Some kind of lead that can help us find Jadalla Bin-Khalid and his men before they launch any attacks.<eos> And you're basing that on what?
Not right away.<eos> Like, if he's still got business going on, there ain't no reason that you can't wait here.<eos> Nicole, you're safe right here. With me.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I know.<eos> But I'm still leaving.<eos> All right.<eos> Go.<eos> Sir, it's Locke.<eos> Tell me you got something.
Don't waste any more time.<eos> Gather your assault teams, set up a perimeter at that location.<eos> We'll redirect satellite up-links and reconnect with you onsite.<eos> Copy that.<eos> It's Carter.<eos> Carter, I got your text.<eos> I'm sending agents to retrieve your wife to bring her to CTU.<eos> She'll be safe. Thank you.<eos> I need to speak to Rebecca Ingram.<eos> Rebecca is indisposed. What do you need from her?

Okay, put him on.<eos> Hold on, I'll transfer you.<eos> This is Andy.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Why aren't you point on this?<eos> Mullins revoked my clearance.<eos> He knows I'm the one that gave Eric Carter the classified missile specs.<eos> Some might consider what I did an act of courage.<eos> Courage?<eos> Yeah. Something you could've used a little more of.

Go very slow.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was DOJ.<eos> Since all we have on Henry is what John heard him say, we can't detain him past 24 hours.<eos> Okay, let's keep him on ice till this plays out.<eos> What's Locke's ETA?<eos> We've got one satellite feed on the property Jadalla's holed up in. Waiting for a second to come online.<eos> You can also piggyback into traffic cams from district DOT.<eos> Of course, you already knew that.

I ordered a media blackout. How the hell did this get out?<eos> Some stringer must have posted it.<eos> Find out who else is running the story.<eos> When we spoke with port officials, they said they were not aware of any suspicious activity... The man who brought us into the country, how much did he know about us?<eos> Wipe the equipments.<eos> Destroy what we can't take with us.<eos> Get ready to move out!<eos> Get ready.<eos> We're 30 seconds out.<eos> You miss it?

Damn it.<eos> Widen the satellite grid.<eos> And put out a full inter-agency alert on Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> They killed my men.<eos> And they almost killed me and my wife.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> But we had them.<eos> I had them!<eos> I found them for you.<eos> I tracked Jadalla, and you and your men lost them.
I'm sorry.<eos> But if you come home, I promise, I will be.<eos> It's too late to stop...<eos> Even if I wanted to.<eos> No, princess.<eos> It's never too late.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> This will all be over soon.<eos> 911, what is your emergency?<eos> Last time we spoke, you said you were moving in on Jadalla Bin-Khalid.

What's up? This is Keith Mullins,<eos> Director of the National Counter Terrorism Unit, Washington DC.<eos> I need you to listen to me very carefully.<eos> There's a truck bomb on the bridge as we speak.<eos> Truck bomb?<eos> It's a white box truck coming from the west.<eos> New Jersey license plate LDJ8053, female driver.<eos> Sir, it's just me in this booth.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> New Jersey PD's moving in, and NYPD's closing roads to the east, but I need you to close the bridge and get as many people clear as you can.

At least 100.<eos> I tried to stop them.<eos> Yeah, we all tried. We all failed.<eos> I just keep thinking, if I hadn't left CTU when I did...<eos> Rebecca, that wouldn't have made any difference.<eos> I could've done more.<eos> They're still out there.<eos> Okay? Either we give up, or we hunt them down.<eos> It's my wife.<eos> You should talk to her.
Mullins knows I helped Carter. He took away my clearance, and he'll fire me as soon as he figures out how.<eos> I shouldn't have gotten involved.<eos> Some might consider what I did an act of courage.<eos> Courage?<eos> Look, I'm gonna send CTU to pick you up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - For what?<eos> Isaac. We have her.<eos> And we took the brother as well.<eos> You told John you gave the identities of the Army Rangers to Jadalla Bin-Khalid.
My husband will never go along with this.<eos> Okay, what do you suggest we do?<eos> Stall him. Keep him from finding out what we're doing for as long as you can.<eos> I can park him in the debrief, but it's a matter of time<eos> - till he figures it out.<eos> - I know. I'll deal with that when it happens.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> ...to see clearly the extent of damage to the bridge.<eos> Officials at this point believe that some type of bomb went off...<eos> Rebecca. You have approval to move on Henry.
Oh, my God, Isaac.<eos> Yalla.<eos> Yalla.<eos> Your wound.<eos> She's a nurse.<eos> Gently.<eos> She's our guest.<eos> You need stitches.<eos> Bring whatever she needs.<eos> What do you want?
Yalla.<eos> Yalla.<eos> Your wound.<eos> She's a nurse.<eos> Gently.<eos> She's our guest.<eos> You need stitches.<eos> Bring whatever she needs.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Why are you holding us hostage?
My husband's team killed him in Yemen.<eos> Yes. And my mujahideen killed them in return.<eos> Didn't kill my husband, though.<eos> You're gonna need to take your shirt off.<eos> And there's been a major explosion on the George Washington Bridge heading into Manhattan, and we have reports of many fatalities...<eos> Horrifying, isn't it?<eos> But based on the images we have seen so far, we can speculate that the number of fatalities could easily be within the 100 range...<eos> Of course it is.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> But if you think this will make Eric do what you want, you're wrong.

Tell me what you're doing.<eos> We're taking out Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> Jadalla's flash drive is damaged.<eos> He told me to bring someone who could fix it and he's...<eos> He kidnapped my wife and my brother as leverage.<eos> I'm going with Carter to Jadalla.<eos> He thinks I'm gonna repair the flash drive, but I-I wrote a virus that'll destroy it.<eos> Let's say you fry the flash drive.<eos> Then what happens?<eos> How do you get out of there?
No. That's gonna be an awkward conversation.<eos> You're up to speed with everything we need from Henry?<eos> Yeah. Then you should get started.<eos> All right.<eos> So when were you two together?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It was a long time ago...<eos> after my wife was killed.<eos> She met Donovan, and that was that.<eos> So this is why you're doing the job?

Look, Sidra, this is just about the money, all right?<eos> Don't make it about something that it's not.<eos> What is this?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Just the truth, Mr. Donovan.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> The truth about what?<eos> About an hour ago, Jadalla Bin-Khalid launched a massive terrorist attack on New York City.<eos> And we know he's planning more.<eos> We also know that you've been in contact with him.

He said he was on his way back to the house.<eos> What?<eos> CTU released him?<eos> That's what it sounded like, but he should've been here by now.<eos> The GPS on his phone and car have gone quiet, and I can't reach anyone on his security team.<eos> How long ago did he call?<eos> 15, 20 minutes.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Senator, we haven't finished yet.<eos> Unless I'm under arrest, you need to stand down from this door, sir.
Let me see.<eos> Yeah. Come on, now.<eos> You know my grandma hit harder than them dudes, man.<eos> Come on.<eos> Close it up.<eos> All bridges leading into Manhattan are shut down and evacuated.<eos> NYPD's working on closing down the tunnels.<eos> Director Mullins.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You've released my father?
We're slowing down.<eos> Look, if I'm about to go out, I'm-a just say what I got to say.<eos> All right?<eos> Nicole, I love you.<eos> I always have.<eos> Always will.<eos> Andy... remember, be sure Jadalla believes I'm forcing you to do this.<eos> Follow my lead.<eos> Mr. Carter.<eos> And you must be Mr. Shalowitz.
Carter will deliver the solution.<eos> This wouldn't have happened if Henry Donovan hadn't given the Rangers' IDs to the terrorists.<eos> We both know conventional methods won't get him to talk.<eos> We need to use enhanced interrogation.<eos> My people are already in position to pick up Henry and take him to a black site.<eos> Go!<eos> - I want a name.<eos> - We're good to go.<eos> What is this?<eos> What do you want?
My son is a U.S. senator!<eos> If I don't get us free, this thing ends real bad.<eos> They're not gonna hurt us, okay?<eos> - They need us.<eos> - They need us to get to Eric.<eos> And when they do, they ain't gonna need us no more.<eos> Jadalla has my wife.<eos> And he has my brother.<eos> The flash drive containing the list of sleeper cells has been damaged and he needs somebody to repair it.<eos> You're not actually asking me to repair the drive, are you?
I'm sending you GPS coordinates for the exchange.<eos> Baby.<eos> My brother!<eos> Get her to CTU, Isaac.<eos> Go!<eos> Find Carter's wife and brother before they get too far.<eos> And kill them.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> If you are just joining us, there has been a terrible explosion on the George Washington Bridge.

I've got Agent Locke on the line.<eos> Where the hell you been?<eos> You logged out of the building without telling anyone.
Sorry... sir.<eos> Andy.<eos> I need you to keep it together.<eos> Tr-Trying.<eos> _<eos> Now, you. Fix the flash drive.<eos> Recover the data on it.<eos> I-I need my laptop.<eos> It has the data recovery programs on it.<eos> You're going to walk my friend through every program you have on this laptop.

Nah.<eos> Hey... look...<eos> Eric brought you to me because those people cannot be trusted.<eos> Okay.<eos> So who you calling, then?<eos> I'm-a call my crew.<eos> I'm-a tell them, bring every burner, every weapon we got.<eos> Meantime, this dude gonna tell us where they took Eric.<eos> They messed with the wrong people.<eos> You think you can do this to me and just get away clean?

Okay.<eos> Thanks, Keith.<eos> Let me know as soon you have any news.<eos> Maybe Mr. Donovan here knows something that could help us catch Jadalla in time.<eos> How soon until you're ready?<eos> We're close, we're almost done with his medical screens.<eos> How far away is your husband?<eos> Minutes.<eos> I've been able to learn about you.<eos> Where you came from, the drugs, the violence.

Recover the data.<eos> What's happening?<eos> He has triggered a virus.<eos> To erase the flash drive.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm not going to shoot you.<eos> This was a decoy.<eos> The real flash drive is safe.<eos> And now that Hamid knows where your virus is, he can disable it.<eos> You'll recover the list for us.

Director Mullins?<eos> Give us another five or ten minutes, hopefully we'll have Andy and Carter's location.<eos> I'm running a four-branch recovery algorithm.<eos> First branch is already finished.<eos> As soon as the program runs through the other three branches, the data will be restored.<eos> This makes sense as an approach.<eos> How long will this take?<eos> Uh, based on what I'm seeing, ten, maybe 12 more minutes.<eos> A little more.<eos> You're wasting your time.

You people will lose.<eos> You don't get it, Jadalla.<eos> This country's so much stronger than your jihad.<eos> And it'll still be standing long after false prophets and lunatics like you are dust.<eos> Faded.<eos> Forgotten.<eos> And for the record... if there is something... anything on your side, it sure as hell isn't God.<eos> We'll see.<eos> I'm gonna ask you again.<eos> How did you and Jadalla Bin-Khalid communicate?

Look, I'll tell you what.<eos> I'll make it worth your whiles.<eos> A'ight?<eos> I'll double your cuts.<eos> Every one of you.<eos> You do that, you'll be left with almost nothing.<eos> He'll still have his brother.<eos> Family's got to mean something, right?<eos> Or else what's the point?<eos> I remember when you were all family, when there wasn't anything you wouldn't do for each other before everything was just business.
Andy and Carter?<eos> Yeah, he knows.<eos> I argued against it, but I lost.<eos> The DNI's order was final.<eos> Understood?<eos> I understand, but I don't like it.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Route the coordinates to the DoD, then to the tac team.<eos> - But sir...<eos> - You heard what I said.

Be quiet.<eos> You think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?<eos> I swear to God I'm gonna<eos> - watch you die.<eos> - I said shut up.<eos> Isaac.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> You need to get out of there now.
- Great.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Eric Carter's on the line for you.<eos> - Carter, go ahead.<eos> - Naseri's not here.<eos> Is there anything on your end?<eos> We're re-scanning satellite to see if we can find him leaving, but the smoke from the missile's creating some blind spots.<eos> I think he made a call about 20 minutes ago.<eos> Maybe you can track him that way?
I do.<eos> I got to go, man.<eos> Going after this man...<eos> It has to be you?<eos> Of course it does.<eos> Hey, why am I even asking?<eos> I'm almost finished recovering the list of sleeper cells.<eos> We all owe you a lot, Andy.<eos> I know.<eos> I want you to run the takedown with Locke, coordinate with the regional law enforcement agencies.
Open it.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Where's Jennifer?<eos> What is this?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your girlfriend is wearing a vest lined with C-4 plastic explosives.<eos> I'm going to tell you exactly what to do and when.<eos> If you deviate from what I'm telling you to do...
No connection to anyone on the watch list or the NCIC database.<eos> I'll send her DMV profile as soon as it comes up.<eos> Our location's plus or minus a hundred meters.<eos> It's possible<eos> Naseri was calling someone else near the house.<eos> We'll find out soon enough.<eos> I got eyes on the house now.<eos> Jennifer Marshall's wired up.<eos> The remote trigger is live.<eos> You should get out of there.
That's enough time to draft a statement.<eos> But, um...<eos> I don't want to do it here.<eos> How's the roll-up going?<eos> Fine, except we got a complication.<eos> One of the terrorists slipped away, someone from your Bin-Khalid operation.<eos> - Naseri?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Guy's got nine lives, and he's used only three so far.<eos> Rebecca, before your debrief, I was hoping you could talk to Jadalla, see what you could find out.
Listen, I have a meeting... later on tonight with the party chairman about suspending my campaign.<eos> If I do that, I...<eos> I'd-I'd really like to talk to you.<eos> You know, face-to-face.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know how long I'm going to be...<eos> Could you come here?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Okay.<eos> You okay?
You know, face-to-face.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know how long I'm going to be...<eos> Could you come here?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Okay.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh...<eos> Would you mind very much taking the follow car, and I'll head on over to the chairman's office.
_<eos> Stephen.<eos> Ms. Ingram.<eos> I-I didn't know you were back.<eos> Keith asked me to interrogate Jadalla, see if we can get a lead on Naseri.<eos> Stephen, are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just, uh... I'm fighting something.<eos> Ms. Ingram?<eos> Biometrics are in place whenever you're ready.

I'm fine.<eos> I just, uh... I'm fighting something.<eos> Ms. Ingram?<eos> Biometrics are in place whenever you're ready.<eos> I'm Rebecca Ingram.<eos> But you already know that.<eos> As it stands, you're set to be transferred from here to a five-foot square cell in Guantanamo.<eos> But tell me what I want to know, and I'll petition my government on your behalf.<eos> Recommend that you're sent to a federal prison.<eos> You'll live the rest of your life under much better conditions.
Return to your studies if you want.<eos> Asim Naseri escaped from the warehouse.<eos> We want to know what operation he's running and how to find him.<eos> I don't know anyone named Naseri.<eos> Eric Carter saw him with you.<eos> I don't know anyone named Naseri.<eos> This man was your father's top operative.<eos> No, this man is a fighter I recruited.<eos> His name is Hamed.<eos> You're throwing away your chance.
So whoever's watching, they're looking at a loop<eos> - of the past few minutes, okay?<eos> - No, I don't want to die.<eos> - I don't want to die.<eos> They can't see us all. - Listen.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> No one's gonna die.<eos> My name is Eric Carter.<eos> I'm working with the Counter Terrorism Unit.<eos> I need you to tell me why they're threatening you, okay?
- Just get this thing off me.<eos> Get rid of this.<eos> - Wh-Who are they leveraging?<eos> - Get me out.<eos> - Jennifer!<eos> Hold her.<eos> Hold her!<eos> Theo, you got to get this thing off of her.<eos> Now.<eos> Whenever you're ready.
Just underneath the lower right front section of the vest.<eos> I see them.<eos> Jennifer, stay very still.<eos> Okay?<eos> Theo.<eos> Spliced into one of those wires is the remote trigger.<eos> It's a small, black plastic box.<eos> Yeah, I see it.<eos> Okay, we're gonna deactivate it.<eos> And once we do, you can cut her out of the vest.
- What do you mean, "Oh"?<eos> Vest has a backup vibration sensor, okay? If...<eos> It'll go hot if the remote trigger's deactivated.<eos> Jennifer.<eos> Jennifer.<eos> Jennifer!<eos> Stay calm.<eos> - Theo, is there any way to take it out?<eos> - No.<eos> You're just gonna have to be extra careful when you remove the vest, okay?
Jennifer.<eos> Jennifer!<eos> Stay calm.<eos> - Theo, is there any way to take it out?<eos> - No.<eos> You're just gonna have to be extra careful when you remove the vest, okay?<eos> One sharp movement will trigger a detonation, all right, usually with a ten-second delay.<eos> Extra careful.<eos> Right.<eos> First step, you need to cut the short wire spanning through the circuit board.
What's next?<eos> Asim, we're pulling in to CTU.<eos> Yeah?<eos> This is Grant.<eos> I'm, uh... expecting a team of subcontractors.<eos> They're at the gate.<eos> Yeah, I'm not seeing their clearances on the network.<eos> Hey, we had a power loss on one of those servers.<eos> That's what they're here to fix.<eos> You want me to let them through, I'll need your override.
- Copy that.<eos> Guns out.<eos> Tip of the fingers.<eos> Left hand.<eos> - Put 'em on the floor.<eos> - John...<eos> Please.<eos> Do it now.<eos> I don't want to hurt anybody.<eos> Swear to God, I'll pull the trigger if you don't do what I say.
Reed.<eos> I've got a, uh, blinking yellow on egress three.<eos> I want you to take a look.<eos> It's probably just some kind of a drill, but I want you to do a full sweep anyway.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Go.<eos> Move.<eos> Yes.<eos> I've got him.<eos> I'm not gonna hand him over until you show me proof that Jennifer's safe.

I see white wires leading to some kind of a switch, and a single wire leading out.<eos> All right, good.<eos> That's the trigger.<eos> Okay, so clip the single wire, and the vest can't be remotely detonated anymore.<eos> Got it.<eos> It's done.<eos> It's done.<eos> Jennifer, listen to me,<eos> I'm gonna remove this vest, okay?<eos> Okay. But I need you to remain still a little while longer, okay?
Okay.<eos> - Okay. Good.<eos> Stay still, okay?<eos> Hurry, hurry.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> Jennifer, no!<eos> Jennifer, no!<eos> Theo, I think she's activated the vibration sensor.<eos> You've got ten seconds.
I promise.<eos> But I need you to get out of here now.<eos> - Please.<eos> - But...<eos> Rebecca!<eos> Move!<eos> Stephen, stop!<eos> Jennifer's safe.<eos> - We got the vest off.<eos> - Stay where you are!
_<eos> I believe you know of my father, Ibrahim Bin-Khalid.
You think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?<eos> I swear to God, I'm gonna watch you die.<eos> I said shut up.<eos> There's one last thing that I need to take care of.<eos> What you tell Nicole?<eos> I need you to look out for her a little while longer.<eos> Jennifer Marshall's been strapped into a vest filled with ordinance.<eos> And I think Naseri is watching her on some kind of a Web cam.<eos> Get it off, get it off!<eos> You've got ten seconds.
- Naseri was holding<eos> Stephen Grant's girlfriend. They're using him to break out<eos> - Jadalla!<eos> - Tell me that you're okay!<eos> I'm fine, I promise, but I need you to get out of here now.<eos> - That's John Donovan.<eos> - Take him.<eos> Rebecca!<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were my father's lieutenant?<eos> You'll get your answers soon.
- Jadalla!<eos> - Tell me that you're okay!<eos> I'm fine, I promise, but I need you to get out of here now.<eos> - That's John Donovan.<eos> - Take him.<eos> Rebecca!<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were my father's lieutenant?<eos> You'll get your answers soon.<eos> For now, be happy.<eos> You have your freedom.
Now that his son's been taken, he might open up about<eos> - what he knows.<eos> - I already left word.<eos> I can't reach him.<eos> Rebecca.<eos> I just heard about John.<eos> It was Naseri, wasn't it?<eos> He was here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You need to let me speak to Jennifer Marshall.
You need to let me speak to Jennifer Marshall.<eos> She may have overheard something while Naseri was holding her.<eos> Something that could help us find him.<eos> She may not be in any condition to answer questions.<eos> Yeah, well, I'll get her there.<eos> Henry...<eos> I just got your message.<eos> What do you mean John's in trouble?<eos> Henry, he's been taken.<eos> By Jadalla Bin-Khalid, the man you sold those soldiers' lives to.
Henry...<eos> I just got your message.<eos> What do you mean John's in trouble?<eos> Henry, he's been taken.<eos> By Jadalla Bin-Khalid, the man you sold those soldiers' lives to.<eos> I... I don't understand.<eos> Jadalla's men broke him out of CTU.<eos> John was on his way here to see me and they took him.<eos> He's gone, Henry, and right now, we have no way to get him back.<eos> You were in contact with Jadalla.

Careful, careful.<eos> Father?<eos> My son.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> God saved the Sheikh's life that day for this day.<eos> To see his son come back to him.<eos> Before he could reveal himself, he had to make sure that your heart was truly with his.<eos> I'm sorry, Father.<eos> No.<eos> I came to finish what you started and...
How far is our team from the Donovan estate?<eos> Ten minutes out.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Have DCPD issue a BOLO for Luis Diaz.<eos> And send out an interagency alert, code one.<eos> What's happened?<eos> I just spoke with Henry Donovan.<eos> Luis Diaz is gone.<eos> He assaulted Henry and fled the premises.<eos> Y-You need to send an ambulance out to the estate.
Luis Diaz is gone.<eos> He assaulted Henry and fled the premises.<eos> Y-You need to send an ambulance out to the estate.<eos> Right away.<eos> I need to take this.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How we doing?<eos> Hello.<eos> John Donovan's execution in front of the world would make a powerful statement.<eos> But he is not our enemy, you are.

Now, if you're prepared to answer for your crimes, you can save your husband's life.<eos> Are you interested?<eos> Stephen never loved his wife.<eos> The only reason he stayed was because of their son.<eos> He said as soon as Kyle left for college...<eos> Jennifer... hey.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss...<eos> But the man who killed Stephen is still out there.<eos> And he is gonna kill more people unless we stop him.<eos> Anything that you heard, no matter how small...

I-I can finish up here.<eos> That's why, that's why I'm here.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Um... uh, Jennifer, this is Andy.<eos> He's just gonna keep asking you a few more questions, okay?<eos> - Okay, I'll be right back.<eos> - Hi, Jennifer.<eos> How are you feeling?
I still have provisional status.<eos> Good... 'cause I'm-a need a few things.<eos> We'll be leaving soon to meet your wife, but let me ask you something, Senator.<eos> How does it feel to be married to a monster, huh?<eos> You're the monster.<eos> Because the only monsters in this world are the ones who kill Americans?<eos> No.<eos> No, those who, for whatever their reasons, murder innocent people.<eos> On that score, your wife is second to none.<eos> And you're a liar.

Run this through analytics.<eos> - "East July"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And run a full interagency data-mine.<eos> Use clearance profile<eos> A-116, okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah, thanks.<eos> Got it.<eos> You wanted to see me?
Perfetto.<eos> Half of the money's gonna be ready for us when we get there.<eos> What about our cover?<eos> The Belgian has our identities ready.<eos> We should go.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Mr. Almeida, Director Keith Mullins from CTU.<eos> How the hell did you get my number?<eos> We have a situation and we need your help.<eos> Sorry, you called the wrong guy.

Just, uh she thinks I need this.<eos> Do you?<eos> - I'm on my way.<eos> - Good.<eos> And I remind you again, if I see any sign that you're not alone...<eos> I'm alone.<eos> I'm alone.<eos> Your husband's life depends on it.<eos> Let me speak to John.<eos> Once you reach the coordinates, I'll send you proof of life.
Eric Carter. Yes.<eos> His involvement could mean Rebecca is planning to do more than trade herself for her husband.<eos> Are you suggesting we let her go through with this?<eos> I am suggesting that we think this through before we stop her,<eos> - which I think...<eos> - Director Mullins, Senator Donovan's kidnapping was a blow to this country.<eos> But if the terrorists get their hands on a former CTU director, there are things that...<eos> We've already revoked Ms. Ingram's provisional status, and we're updating security passwords and codes that she may have been exposed to today.<eos> That's all well and good, but Rebecca Ingram's capture has ramifications beyond your passwords and codes.<eos> You are to do everything in your power to bring her in...
We got a signal from Almeida's tracking device.<eos> Just one ping, and it's weak, but it was enough.<eos> Rebecca and Carter are traveling west on King's Highway.<eos> Okay, they're less than a mile from the King's County sheriff station.<eos> Mariana, alert the station.<eos> Send them a description of Carter's vehicle.<eos> Have them run an intercept.<eos> Ma'am, this area is secure.<eos> I understand, but I need to speak with Director Mullins.<eos> He's busy right now, you need to get back upstairs.

- Sir, you need to calm down, sir.<eos> Sir.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> Fine.<eos> You came here to get an answer from Eric.<eos> You got your answer.<eos> I don't like seeing you like this.<eos> Look at me.<eos> When you and Eric walked out on me, one thought kept me going.<eos> That you was moving on to something better.
- We've only got a few minutes.<eos> - We're not far.<eos> You drive ahead,<eos> I'll follow on foot.<eos> I'll only be a few minutes behind you,<eos> Jadalla won't see us coming.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> I got your back.<eos> This is Andy.<eos> That phrase you asked me to data-mine, "East July"?
Carter, did you hear me?<eos> It's not gonna come to that.<eos> Promise me.<eos> Carter, promise.<eos> Okay, I promise.<eos> I don't see anyone.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Jadalla, it looks like she's here alone.<eos> Hello.<eos> You kept your promise.
Promise me.<eos> Carter, promise.<eos> Okay, I promise.<eos> I don't see anyone.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Jadalla, it looks like she's here alone.<eos> Hello.<eos> You kept your promise.<eos> Now listen carefully and do exactly what I say.<eos> I want you to move to the center of the field.

_<eos> John Donovan's execution in front of the world would make a powerful statement.<eos> Now, if you're prepared to answer for your crimes, you can save your husband's life.
Rebecca intends to surrender herself to the terrorists in exchange for her husband's life.<eos> Rebecca Ingram's in trouble.<eos> I need to help CTU locate her.<eos> We miss the flight, we lose the job, Tony.<eos> Show me proof that my husband is free and safe and I'll walk into that field.<eos> Naseri, tell them to release Donovan now.<eos> John's okay.<eos> He's free.<eos> Get out of there, Rebecca.<eos> You're gonna read your confession.
So is this.<eos> Got to go.<eos> Can't you save any of this?<eos> I'm trying, but they're remote erasing everything.<eos> Sir, Director Simms is on line one.<eos> Says it's urgent.<eos> Yeah, okay, put him through.<eos> Hold for Director Simms.<eos> Keith.<eos> Sir, if you're calling for an update on Rebecca, we're still very much...
Sir, if you're calling for an update on Rebecca, we're still very much...<eos> I'm actually calling to give you a heads-up.<eos> A heads-up?<eos> Daniel Pang is on his way over there now.<eos> Should be there any second.<eos> Why is he coming here?<eos> I've given him provisional status as co-director of CTU.<eos> From now on, any planning or decisions are to be coordinated through him.<eos> Sir, with respect, um, I think that's a huge mistake.<eos> Keith, you allowed Rebecca Ingram to fall into the hands of terrorists.

Sir, with respect, um, I think that's a huge mistake.<eos> Keith, you allowed Rebecca Ingram to fall into the hands of terrorists.<eos> It's obvious that you need all the help that you can get now.<eos> Sir, I'm perfectly willing to take responsibility for everything that's gone wrong, but...<eos> Daniel' s an administrator.<eos> H-He has no field experience and...<eos> Which is why I'm keeping you there to fill the gaps.<eos> - Sir...<eos> - My decision's final.<eos> You are to give Daniel everything he asks for.
Good.<eos> Sir, Daniel just got here.<eos> Thank you for your cooperation, Keith.<eos> Absolutely, anything I can do.<eos> Daniel.<eos> Keith.<eos> Did Director Simms reach you?<eos> - Yeah, just got off the phone with him.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> I just, uh, want to let you know, I didn't lobby for this.
Did Director Simms reach you?<eos> - Yeah, just got off the phone with him.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> I just, uh, want to let you know, I didn't lobby for this.<eos> Simms called me out of the blue and wanted me to help out.<eos> And I appreciate that.<eos> So, uh, I guess I need an office.<eos> Yes, we have a vacant one up on the second floor.<eos> Actually, I was thinking about something a bit more central.<eos> Do you mind if I use yours?
One, uh, setback too many.<eos> No, that's not why he's here.<eos> Something's going on and Director Simms is involved.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - I just hacked into his server.<eos> - You what?<eos> Pang is here because of what I found on Director Simms.<eos> I'd like to talk to you in private, now.<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> Look, I don't know if you found anything, but just have CTU check anyway.
Pang is here because of what I found on Director Simms.<eos> I'd like to talk to you in private, now.<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> Look, I don't know if you found anything, but just have CTU check anyway.<eos> Roger that, sir.<eos> Senator.<eos> Rebecca talked about you, talked about you a lot, about your missions together.<eos> So I, I feel like I almost, I almost know you.<eos> She, uh, admired you, you should know that.<eos> She considered you a friend.
Rebecca talked about you, talked about you a lot, about your missions together.<eos> So I, I feel like I almost, I almost know you.<eos> She, uh, admired you, you should know that.<eos> She considered you a friend.<eos> I feel the same way.<eos> Well, then you should've said something to her about all of this.<eos> Should've stopped her.<eos> S-Sir.<eos> I-I... Sir, I thought this was a good plan.<eos> You thought it was a good plan to help her turn herself over to these monsters?
Carter.<eos> Hey, It's Keith.<eos> Andy's on the line, too.<eos> Is there anything new on Rebecca?<eos> No, not from the search, but there may be another way to find her.<eos> What?<eos> Are you alone?<eos> I am now.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Remember you had me do the debrief of Jennifer Marshall, the woman you saved from the bomb vest?
I need the room.<eos> Senator.<eos> Hello, Don.<eos> I can't tell you how relieved I am to know that you're safe.<eos> Well, I appreciate that.<eos> I wish we had better news on Rebecca.<eos> I assure you we're doing everything we can to bring her back.<eos> Well, I'm gonna want to know what that is, exactly.<eos> I can be over there in about ten minutes.<eos> You're coming here?
Well, I appreciate that.<eos> I wish we had better news on Rebecca.<eos> I assure you we're doing everything we can to bring her back.<eos> Well, I'm gonna want to know what that is, exactly.<eos> I can be over there in about ten minutes.<eos> You're coming here?<eos> Is there a problem with that?<eos> Not at all. Um...<eos> I'm just thinking I can fill you in, uh, over the phone.<eos> Don... you know Rebecca just gave herself up for me.
Don... you know Rebecca just gave herself up for me.<eos> I think I need to look you in the eye when you tell me what her chances are.<eos> Of course, Senator.<eos> I'll be waiting.<eos> You know, nothing really, uh, changed when I said I was coming.<eos> He wasn't really acting like a man who had something to hide.<eos> All that means is that he's really good at it.<eos> Donald Simms.<eos> To think he would do something like this to a ten-year-old girl.<eos> You're absolutely sure about all this?

What is it?<eos> I have an operation that may be compromised.<eos> It needs to be cleaned up.<eos> Where?<eos> Farmhouse, Ravenswood.<eos> Three items.<eos> I want it done fast.<eos> All right, look, I want standard plus 50%.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Nothing happens till you wire me the money.

Everything will stream from there.<eos> How long will that take?<eos> Not long at all.<eos> Come here.<eos> Grab this.<eos> Put pressure on it.<eos> Keep pressing.<eos> I was wrong, Eric.<eos> I shouldn't have come down on you like that before.<eos> You weren't wrong.
Not long at all.<eos> Come here.<eos> Grab this.<eos> Put pressure on it.<eos> Keep pressing.<eos> I was wrong, Eric.<eos> I shouldn't have come down on you like that before.<eos> You weren't wrong.<eos> No, no, I was...<eos> You were just following Rebecca's lead.
And I guess I should have known that she couldn't.<eos> Well, she was trying to save your life.<eos> Oh, believe me, I-I know that.<eos> I know that.<eos> But even before... I guess it wasn't easy for her to give up CTU.<eos> Her work's in her blood, you know?<eos> She can't live without it.<eos> What?<eos> My wife, she, uh... she said the same thing about me.<eos> Huh. Well, maybe you should listen to her.
Uh, Mariana?<eos> Yeah, we based your credentials around an agent who's on leave, but we haven't had time to backstop everything.<eos> Will it get me through security or not?<eos> We think so, but I'd feel better if we had a little more time.<eos> Well, we don't, okay?<eos> Neither does Rebecca.<eos> So please just get those credentials.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Here comes Pang.<eos> Hope you all know what you're doing.
Here comes Pang.<eos> Hope you all know what you're doing.<eos> About to find out.<eos> Senator John Donovan.<eos> Yes, Senator, you've been expected.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, could you try that again, please?<eos> We all right?<eos> All set.<eos> There you go, sir.
So far, no signs of unauthorized activity.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Well, I could be more sure if you told exactly what it is I'm looking for.<eos> As in, what files were accessed.<eos> Daniel, you're not read in.<eos> That's the way it has to be.<eos> And I'm not in no way complaining.<eos> I just want to do the best job I can.<eos> Just keep everyone on task.<eos> And if you locate any of the stolen files, I want them quarantined.
This must be such a, uh, difficult time.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> I notified all the heads of NSA, FBI...<eos> Oh. Cavalry's not coming.<eos> Stop.<eos> Move.<eos> Back away.<eos> Now. Move.<eos> What the hell's going on here, John?<eos> We know what you did to Asim Naseri's daughter.

Stop.<eos> Move.<eos> Back away.<eos> Now. Move.<eos> What the hell's going on here, John?<eos> We know what you did to Asim Naseri's daughter.<eos> What?<eos> John, I honestly don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Don't give me that.<eos> You have information that could potentially save Rebecca's life and you're holding onto it so you could cover your ass.
She was your friend!<eos> Where's the hardware key?<eos> Sit down.<eos> Fingerprint, now.<eos> Good.<eos> Cover him.<eos> Andy, Simms is secure.<eos> I'm logging in to the terminal now.<eos> Go to the I.P. address I gave you.<eos> It'll give me access to his screen, once you override the firewall.
For the last year.<eos> Naseri doesn't know that.<eos> I just saw a call that was intercepted a year ago where he said, "the Americans killed my daughter."<eos> Andy, this number you found for Naseri... I know we can't track his location, but is there any way that we can contact him?<eos> I'd have to verify it, but it is still active.<eos> Okay, if we can get the girl from the safe house, prove to Naseri that his daughter's still alive, I might be able to negotiate.<eos> He already refused once.<eos> Andy, that was about turning over Bin-Khalid.<eos> This is about Rebecca.<eos> You're wasting your time.

Good luck.<eos> So we take the girl, everyone else we scrub.<eos> What happens with the girl?<eos> She's being renditioned to an agency black site in Jalapa.<eos> People don't come back from that place.<eos> Our job is to get her there.<eos> The rest is none of our concern.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> He's not gonna find anything at the farmhouse, John.<eos> You want to help Rebecca, you drop this, let me get back to work.
No, I...<eos> I think I would consider that crossing a line.<eos> It is very often that it is the enemy who determines how you fight a war, how best to save American lives.<eos> Well, why don't we just bomb 'em all, then, Don?<eos> Hmm? I mean, they can't kill us if they're all dead, right?<eos> That'll save some American lives.<eos> I should have thought that being married to Rebecca would have opened your eyes by now.<eos> Why would you say something like that?<eos> Because your wife understands how the world operates.<eos> I think I've learned enough about Rebecca to know that, yes, she-she's willing to push some boundaries, but she would never do what you've done.

You are a liar.<eos> Pulse is stabilizing.<eos> She'll recover?<eos> Enough for our purposes.<eos> As soon as she's strong enough, we will begin.<eos> Praise to God for this small miracle.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> That's right, you're still alive.

These are Simms' people and they're here to kill us.<eos> Okay, Carter, I just notified the state police, and they're sending a SWAT team to the house, but they're 20 minutes away.<eos> Yeah, we won't last that long.<eos> Okay, wait a minute.<eos> H-Hold on a minute.<eos> Hello?<eos> Senator Donovan, this is Andy Shalowitz at CTU.<eos> Carter found Naseri's daughter, but there are four armed individuals surrounding the house.<eos> Simms sent these people to the house, sir.<eos> You have got to get him to call them off.

I don't even know if I can.<eos> Simms' phone is encrypted, but if I manage to unlock it, Senator Donovan can call the cleanup team and try to get them to back off Carter.<eos> Shoot me an update as soon as you hear from the field team, okay?<eos> - Keith.<eos> - Yeah. I was running a system allocation scan and found something I can't explain.<eos> See that?<eos> Intermittent spikes in data use and bandwidth.<eos> I tried to pinpoint the source, but, uh, the signal's being spread around.<eos> Do you have any operations under way that I don't know about?<eos> No. You're up to speed on everything.

Look, I'm going as fast as I can. I need more time.<eos> Yeah, well, doesn't look like you're gonna get it.<eos> If he cuts us off, Carter's never gonna make it out of that farmhouse alive.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Keith, what's going on?<eos> It takes two seconds to allocate memory.<eos> Uh, Mariana says they're having an issue with the pipeline.<eos> Well, why doesn't she just tweak the parameters on the SQL?<eos> I'm sure she's doing what she can.<eos> You really need to sit on your people, Keith.
Well, why doesn't she just tweak the parameters on the SQL?<eos> I'm sure she's doing what she can.<eos> You really need to sit on your people, Keith.<eos> I mean, do I have to do this myself?<eos> No wonder this place is in the crapper.<eos> Hey! Inside the house!<eos> We only want the girl!<eos> Just send her out and then we're done.<eos> Listen to me, the man that hired you, Simms, he's been taken down.<eos> Okay? You don't need to do this any more.

Sorry. I've already been paid.<eos> I always finish a job once I've been paid.<eos> I got a reputation to keep.<eos> I won't let you take the girl.<eos> Then we got a problem.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Do yourself a favor.<eos> Put your weapon down and give yourself up.<eos> We can hash this out like adults.<eos> You hear me?
I'm scared.<eos> It's okay.<eos> All right?<eos> It's okay.<eos> _<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.<eos> I need an answer!<eos> Whoever this guy is, he can't cover both doors.<eos> We're taking him down.<eos> You come in, you die!
_<eos> She does not get to die quietly, Naseri.<eos> We do what we planned.<eos> Recite her crimes, then execute her while the world watches.<eos> - You should've stopped her.

She was gonna get them to release you, and then draw Naseri out so that I could take him down.<eos> My wife is gonna die a terrible death and everyone's gonna see it.<eos> What is it?<eos> I have an operation that may be compromised.<eos> It needs to be cleaned up.<eos> Where?<eos> A farmhouse, Ravenswood.<eos> I want it done fast.<eos> The cavalry's not coming.<eos> You have information that could potentially save Rebecca's life and you're holding onto it so that you could cover your ass?
Hold it!<eos> Where's the girl?<eos> I'm gonna find the girl with or without you.<eos> Look... we had a little bit of a setback, but don't worry.<eos> We're gonna recover the package.<eos> Tony?<eos> Who is this?<eos> I've got Simms on lockdown, Tony.<eos> This is John Donovan.<eos> And that package that you're talking about... might be the only way to save Rebecca.
Tony?<eos> Who is this?<eos> I've got Simms on lockdown, Tony.<eos> This is John Donovan.<eos> And that package that you're talking about... might be the only way to save Rebecca.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> That girl is Naseri's daughter.<eos> We've sent Eric Carter there to protect her.<eos> Naseri thinks she's dead, which means if he finds out that she's alive, there might be a chance that he would trade her for Rebecca.<eos> But that won't happen, Tony, unless you release Carter and that girl.
Tony?<eos> Get him back, get him back.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Eric Carter.<eos> All right, go get the girl and take her out of here.<eos> Just like that?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Let it go, Sidra.<eos> I'd go with you myself, if you hadn't've broken my damn arm.<eos> You didn't give me much of a choice.

_<eos> _<eos> Baba, Baba.<eos> Ara.<eos> Got a voice match.<eos> It's definitely Asim Naseri.<eos> Carter was right.<eos> She never forgot her father's number.<eos> Ara.<eos> If you ever want to talk to your daughter again, you're gonna listen to me very closely.

All right, Mr. Carter.<eos> We will finish this conversation.<eos> Asim, the woman must be punished.<eos> I'll leave that to God.<eos> It, it is not too late for you to change you mind.<eos> Asim!<eos> Sit down.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I keep wondering why you didn't tell me that my daughter is alive.<eos> You didn't even try to save yourself.

It was me.<eos> God willing, you will be punished for your crimes.<eos> And you for yours.<eos> The individual's identity remains unknown, but he appears to intervene in Rebecca Ingram's execution.<eos> His motives are also unknown.<eos> All right, Mr. Carter.<eos> We will finish this conversation.<eos> Senator, we're picking up Naseri's daughter now.<eos> Once Carter has Rebecca, we'll deliver the girl to the Jordanian embassy.<eos> And you trust Naseri?
Just to make sure that Carter is the only one anywhere near the point of exchange.<eos> So to get Rebecca back, it's all on Carter.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> And it was non-negotiable.<eos> And if this works, N-Naseri, he just, he just walks away?<eos> No, once Rebecca's safe, and if he has an opening,<eos> Carter's gonna take out Naseri and Bin-Khalid.<eos> Uh, Senator, we're almost there.<eos> I'll reach out the moment I have anything new.<eos> You think you're saving your wife, John?

Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Ambassador, we're in the air now, and should be landing in front of the embassy in less than five minutes.<eos> Director Mullins, this girl is a Jordanian citizen.<eos> What was she doing in U.S. custody?<eos> She was the target of an unsanctioned operation by an individual in our government.<eos> The goal was to leverage her against her father,<eos> Asim Naseri.<eos> Who was this individual in your government?<eos> I can't get into that right now, but I promise, you'll have an opportunity to litigate this later.

Your daughter's on the way to the embassy, Asim.<eos> I'm on my way to your location, alone, as agreed.<eos> And as agreed, I'm ready to receive the satellite feed.<eos> Andy.<eos> Mr. Naseri.<eos> I've set up a connection to an NSA satellite which we repositioned directly overhead.<eos> How wide a radius does it cover?<eos> I've set the range at two miles, centered on the coordinates you provided Carter.<eos> The function controls are located in a window on the bottom right-hand corner of your screen.<eos> You kept your word, Mr. Carter.

We're just waiting for the go-ahead, then I'll walk the girl over to you.<eos> We were able to contact her mother.<eos> We are arranging for her to travel here.<eos> Ara will be very happy to know that, thank you.<eos> Carter.<eos> I can see you.<eos> Continue onto the train tracks, stop next to the brick building on your right.<eos> Wait in your car.<eos> - For what?<eos> - You have to prove to me that my daughter is safely inside the embassy.

How bad?<eos> It's serious, but there's an ambulance on the way and they'll go to the nearest hospital, St. Catherine's.<eos> We're gonna send a car for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What happened to Rebecca?<eos> She was shot.<eos> They're taking her to a hospital.<eos> How about Naseri's daughter?<eos> Safe in the Jordanian embassy.<eos> Which means everything you've done will come out, and you won't be able to talk your way out of it.

- More pressure please.<eos> Bin-Khalid got his hands on a gun and he was aiming for me, but she... she, uh... she took the bullet for me.<eos> Nice, slow, deep breaths.<eos> I don't know why, but she did.<eos> Let's get another line in, please.<eos> When do I go into surgery?<eos> She, uh... first thing she said when I got to her was your name.<eos> More pressure please.<eos> Blood pressure's 90/60.<eos> You're the only thing she was thinking about.
Uh, there's an FBI agent out here.<eos> He says he needs to see you, something about DNI Simms.<eos> I'll-I'll be right out.<eos> Uh, I need to step out for a few minutes.<eos> Can I stay with her?<eos> Senator.<eos> I'm Agent Dietrich.<eos> I'm sorry to disturb you, but Director Simms was found dead in his office earlier this morning.<eos> Dead?<eos> I understand you were with him last night.
Yeah. Uh, my wife is here.<eos> I'd like to talk to her before the debrief.<eos> Certainly.<eos> She's in his office right now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They told me the funeral is going to be tomorrow.<eos> Family only.<eos> But the, uh, there'll be a memorial service in a couple of weeks.<eos> I think I'm gonna take that vacation I've been putting off.<eos> You sure as hell earned it.
There you go.<eos> Alright, yeah.<eos> Throw strong. Come on, son.<eos> Yeah, alright.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> - I haven't seen you around here before.<eos> - I'm... I'm visiting.<eos> - Visiting?<eos> - Yes.<eos> So, you waiting for someone, or... - Yes.
Alright, yeah.<eos> Throw strong. Come on, son.<eos> Yeah, alright.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> - I haven't seen you around here before.<eos> - I'm... I'm visiting.<eos> - Visiting?<eos> - Yes.<eos> So, you waiting for someone, or... - Yes.<eos> - You're meeting them here?
To be honest, I forgot the sign was still there.<eos> Yes, I... I read the ad actually.<eos> Great.<eos> - Want a closer look?<eos> - Please.<eos> - "Amazing...<eos> - Grace. - Grace.<eos> - Grace, Yeah.<eos> "Amazing Grace".<eos> Are you you a sailor that keeps the name of the boat?
- Want a closer look?<eos> - Please.<eos> - "Amazing...<eos> - Grace. - Grace.<eos> - Grace, Yeah.<eos> "Amazing Grace".<eos> Are you you a sailor that keeps the name of the boat?<eos> Amazing Grace is a perfect name.<eos> If I buy this I will re-paint it.<eos> May I ask why you're selling it?
Amazing Grace is a perfect name.<eos> If I buy this I will re-paint it.<eos> May I ask why you're selling it?<eos> When my father couldn't manage it on his own anymore, he gave it to me.<eos> - He's a generous man.<eos> - Yeah, he was. He passed away recently.<eos> The cabin is in good shape.<eos> There's beautiful mahogany wood down below.<eos> She's much faster than you would expect.<eos> So one day you just decided to jump into the deep end?
She's much faster than you would expect.<eos> So one day you just decided to jump into the deep end?<eos> - The deep end?<eos> - Yeah looking at buying a boat like this, you know?<eos> It was a boat from the blue, yes.<eos> Well, just so you know I'm asking 16 16,000.<eos> - $16,000?<eos> - Yes, $16,000.<eos> Are you firm on that price?<eos> What do you have in mind?
Get back here! You little fuckers! No!<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Beer?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wasn't sure if alcohol was allowed.<eos> Haram.<eos> Haram, right.<eos> And it's been a long time since I was in a mosque.<eos> So you're not a... you're not a practicing.
Haram, right.<eos> And it's been a long time since I was in a mosque.<eos> So you're not a... you're not a practicing.<eos> Not a practicing one, no.<eos> This must be your son. That's him.<eos> That's Shane.<eos> How old?<eos> 16. Smart kid.<eos> Takes after his dad.<eos> May I ask what you do for a living?

Computers.<eos> Jesus Christ, my laptop!<eos> Shit.<eos> I hope this wasn't my doing.<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm I'm trying to write my father's eulogy. It's driving me crazy.<eos> Were you and your father close?

It's driving me crazy.<eos> Were you and your father close?<eos> Yeah, I like to think so.<eos> I need a good opening. Once I get that, then the rest will follow.<eos> Maybe you should start with a childhood memory. Speak to who your father was, not what he accomplished in his life.

Speak to who your father was, not what he accomplished in his life.<eos> Oh, I got plenty of sailing stories.<eos> My brother Dave and I spent every weekend on the boat when we were kids.<eos> There. You've got your opening.
May I make another suggestion?<eos> Sure.<eos> In my humble opinion, allow the story of your father to have true meaning.<eos> True meaning?<eos> I was taught the dead live on in three ways.<eos> Through their good deeds, through the charity other people give in their name and, most important through the knowledge they leave behind in this world that benefits others.<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I hope I was helpful.<eos> Yeah, you were.
- What happened?<eos> - Baseball. Kids.<eos> - Jesus. You okay? - I know.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> - You should have called me.<eos> - I'm fine, really.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I'm Imir Shah.<eos> - You must be Shane.
- Hello.<eos> I'm Imir Shah.<eos> - You must be Shane.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - My dad around, or...<eos> - Yes, he's outside. Greeting your mother.<eos> I'm here to talk about buying the boat.<eos> - That was my granddad's boat.<eos> - I know.<eos> You sure you wanna buy it?

- That was my granddad's boat.<eos> - I know.<eos> You sure you wanna buy it?<eos> You don't think I should?<eos> Well, I don't know, I mean, it's just an old boat.<eos> Hope it doesn't have termites.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Ellen, Mr. Shah.<eos> - I hear you're interested in the boat.
You don't think I should?<eos> Well, I don't know, I mean, it's just an old boat.<eos> Hope it doesn't have termites.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Ellen, Mr. Shah.<eos> - I hear you're interested in the boat.<eos> - I am. Please, call me Imir.<eos> - It's nice to meet you.<eos> I'm gonna put these down and grab a drink. Would you like something?
- He already has a beer.<eos> I also have real Masala Chai tea, if you'd rather.<eos> - That sounds lovely, thank you, Ellen.<eos> Sure.<eos> - Do you need a hand?<eos> - No, I'm fine. Thank you.<eos> You really do have a beautiful home.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, we're... we're working on it.<eos> You're coming home from work, is that right?
- Do you need a hand?<eos> - No, I'm fine. Thank you.<eos> You really do have a beautiful home.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, we're... we're working on it.<eos> You're coming home from work, is that right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She teaches at the... community college.<eos> And what do you teach?<eos> - You're an anthropology teacher.
Yeah.<eos> She teaches at the... community college.<eos> And what do you teach?<eos> - You're an anthropology teacher.<eos> - Ethnology, actually.<eos> - You must have read Levi Strauss.<eos> - Do you know his work?<eos> I was under the impression his ideas were central to ethnological methodology.<eos> Well, in structuralism, yeah. A bit out of fashion these days.<eos> Why, are you an...
Great.<eos> I... don't want to change your mind, but I thought we were gonna negotiate.<eos> Well, you seem like honest people.<eos> I'm sure what you're asking is a fair market price.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That's nice, yeah.<eos> - That's nice. - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I hope you enjoy it.
I'm sure what you're asking is a fair market price.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That's nice, yeah.<eos> - That's nice. - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I hope you enjoy it.<eos> This tea would not be out of place at a cafe in Karachi, Ellen.<eos> It tastes like home.<eos> That's sweet of you. I'm glad you're enjoying it.

What was it you said?
Really?<eos> - I'm surprised he mentioned it to you.<eos> - Hey, I was surprised, too.<eos> What can I say?<eos> Imir enlightened me. What was it you said?<eos> Start with a childhood memory? Something that speaks to who Dad was not what he accomplished in life.<eos> There's my opening.<eos> A sailing story. But it's gonna have a life lesson.<eos> Something Dad taught me.<eos> Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you stay for supper?
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you stay for supper?<eos> - Honey, I'm sure he's got other plans.<eos> - We can talk some more.<eos> As it happens, I don't.<eos> - I would love to share a meal with you.<eos> - Great.<eos> Great. - Yeah.<eos> - We'll celebrate the sale of the boat.<eos> I'll fire up the barbie.<eos> What do you want? Steak?
- He doesn't seem very happy, does he?<eos> - Oh, I don't know. I think...<eos> He has a face my teenaged daughter would sometimes make.<eos> Right, well... teenagers, right?<eos> I mean, his grandfather just died, so that's probably part of it.<eos> Oh, of course. I'm sorry.<eos> No, it's...<eos> Do you mind if I use the loo to wash my hands?<eos> Oh, God, yeah, sure, but the one down here doesn't work, of course.<eos> You'll have to go upstairs. It's just down the hall.
- I don't know.<eos> He said he wanted to go out for a little bit.<eos> I'm gonna put a tracking device on that kid.<eos> Can't you track him with GPS?<eos> I hear a lot of American parents are doing this.<eos> Yeah, I was actually joking.<eos> Yeah, I do know some parents have this new tracking app.<eos> Paranoid parents, which we're not.<eos> Don't give him any ideas, please.<eos> So where... where exactly are you from, Imir?
Yeah, I do know some parents have this new tracking app.<eos> Paranoid parents, which we're not.<eos> Don't give him any ideas, please.<eos> So where... where exactly are you from, Imir?<eos> Karachi.<eos> The city of lights.<eos> How long have you been in the States?<eos> I just arrived.<eos> I'm starting a new contract.<eos> - Oh, yeah? What do you do?
So where... where exactly are you from, Imir?<eos> Karachi.<eos> The city of lights.<eos> How long have you been in the States?<eos> I just arrived.<eos> I'm starting a new contract.<eos> - Oh, yeah? What do you do?<eos> - Systems integration.<eos> I'm a programmer.<eos> Listen, I... I don't wanna change the subject, but maybe we could discuss how you plan to pay for the boat.
- You may.<eos> How about I get us some dessert? Some cheesecake?<eos> I've never had American cheesecake.<eos> I hear it doesn't even taste like cheese.<eos> Hey, Shane. Go help your mom with the dishes.<eos> Are we saving this for anything?<eos> We're gonna toast the sale of the boat.<eos> Perhaps we should include your grandfather in the toast.<eos> Yeah, I like that idea.<eos> You have a big heart, Imir.
To fair weather sailing on the water and off.<eos> Fair weather sailing?<eos> Hey, don't interrupt. I'm just getting started.<eos> - He is not famous for his toasts.<eos> - Yeah, no kidding.<eos> To everyone's health. Including financially.<eos> And lastly, to my father.<eos> For as long as I can remember he loved the sea. And he loved that boat.<eos> Imir we're passing on a piece of Wiston family history to you and I know we've only just met but I think my dad would approve.<eos> Because you're a good man.
Why is the US firing missiles into civilian territory?<eos> - I mean, that doesn't seem...<eos> - Very good question, Shane.<eos> - Maybe Neil has the answer.<eos> - Hey, everyone, I don't think we should...<eos> Let's just not get into this right now, please.<eos> No, hey, it's just discussion.<eos> Okay, but I think it's enough.<eos> I think it's enough.<eos> Look... I can't... I can't even imagine how you feel and we are all...
Wait, is that what you're worried about?<eos> Ellen finding out?<eos> - No, not her.<eos> - Okay, then who?<eos> Just answer the question, will ya?<eos> Why? What's this about?<eos> I'll call you in the morning.<eos> Listen, we should probably go over the spec on the boat and the registration.<eos> Can I see you in my office for a minute?<eos> I don't know what kind of game you think you're playing but I want you out of my house right now!

- Oh, yeah? Why not?<eos> Because of what I've got in my briefcase sitting in your kitchen.<eos> And this detonator.<eos> Do you know how much high explosive is in a hellfire missile, Neil?<eos> Almost 20 pounds. I googled it.<eos> Dammit.<eos> - Canary? This is Rover. - Oh, shit.<eos> Target has a possible explosive device.<eos> In a few minutes it'll be exactly one year from the moment of my family's death.<eos> - What do you want?
Dammit.<eos> - Canary? This is Rover. - Oh, shit.<eos> Target has a possible explosive device.<eos> In a few minutes it'll be exactly one year from the moment of my family's death.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - In time. Give me your phone.<eos> Give it.<eos> Look... Look, your family is dead.<eos> I know, and I'm sorry. I really am. But...<eos> You know exactly what this has to do with you.
- In time. Give me your phone.<eos> Give it.<eos> Look... Look, your family is dead.<eos> I know, and I'm sorry. I really am. But...<eos> You know exactly what this has to do with you.<eos> I told you! I write code for a living!<eos> Stop lying!<eos> Your government data breach, Neil. It opened up a back door to your drone program.<eos> To your flight logs and ultimately to where we're standing right now.<eos> So from now on you will tell the truth to me and to them.
Everything all settled then?<eos> Do they ever show you pictures of the innocents you kill, Neil?<eos> I've got your things.<eos> Are you a dutiful wife, Ellen?<eos> Sorry?<eos> What?<eos> Do you respect your husband?<eos> My relationship with my husband is none of your business.<eos> Now is the time to be honest.<eos> Is there something you want to tell your husband?

Mom?<eos> Neil.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Please...<eos> - What is this, you sick fuck!<eos> - I learned this from you.<eos> I put you under the same surveillance you put my country under with your satellites and your drones.<eos> So no more lies.<eos> Or shall I tell your wife and your son who you really are?
- Tell me the truth!<eos> - Dad, what do you do?<eos> - I told you, I fly UAV's. Drones.<eos> What would be classified about aerial mapping?<eos> Please tell me it's just maps.<eos> I've been part of a test program for... - ...contracted covert missions. - Oh, my God.<eos> The US Air Force uses UAV's to target enemy movements. Just like the military.<eos> We do everything we can to minimize collateral damage. No.<eos> No!<eos> You do not get to reduce it to collateral damage!
Alright.<eos> Well why don't we have a little pow wow before the meeting in the morning.<eos> Tomorrow. Yeah, okay.<eos> And tell Shane to fly straight or I'm gonna kick his ass.<eos> - You hear that, Shane?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, he heard it.<eos> - Alright.<eos> - Yeah, you got it.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> You are a painfully good liar, Neil.
I could have gotten a nurse. I didn't feel like that was what he wanted so I just...<eos> I left him there for them to find him.<eos> I guess I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to feel guilty for not being there.<eos> You should have been there, Dad.<eos> You should have been there.<eos> That's a very good confession, Shane.<eos> But the guilty should never be spared.<eos> Visual ID confirmed.<eos> Have you ever felt real guilt, Neil?<eos> When you look at those people below and you take their lives, do you feel anything?
Visual ID confirmed.<eos> Have you ever felt real guilt, Neil?<eos> When you look at those people below and you take their lives, do you feel anything?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Do you want a confession?<eos> Fine.<eos> Me and the guy who just left, we killed your family.<eos> Satisfied? - Not at all.<eos> - Hey, come on.<eos> You want revenge, don't you?

- Who said anything about revenge?<eos> - Well, why else would you be here?<eos> Haven't you listened to anything I've said?<eos> I'm listening. I'm listening.<eos> Please tell us how we can help you.<eos> Tell us.<eos> I've lost everything.<eos> I'll never see my family again.<eos> There's nothing left for me here.<eos> You're upset, you're not thinking clearly, but this... no, you don't want this. Please.

Please.<eos> - I am thinking clearly.<eos> - Please.<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> I'm thinking of how they were taken from me.<eos> I'll do anything you want. But please let them leave.
I'll do anything you want, please. Just let them leave. Just let them go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Now's the time, Neil.<eos> No target.<eos> Shane!<eos> Shane!<eos> No visual on detonator.<eos> Hold positions.<eos> Get off me!<eos> Now you... understand, Neil.
Now's the time, Neil.<eos> No target.<eos> Shane!<eos> Shane!<eos> No visual on detonator.<eos> Hold positions.<eos> Get off me!<eos> Now you... understand, Neil.<eos> No.<eos> You're not gonna die!
You want to trade the cache, my cache?
What the hell have you done?<eos> If the British empire will not aid us in fighting our present enemy, perhaps a different empire will.<eos> Once you land, I envision no confusion.<eos> I'd simply ask that you burn it all to the ground.<eos> When your people took this place, it was they who suffered the consequences.<eos> Reprisals visited upon their mothers, brothers, children.<eos> Tortured on the other farms as a result of your actions.<eos> I understand.<eos> Which is why I've come here to make that right.<eos> If you had suffered such loss, is there anything you can imagine making it right?
But I imagine getting my hands on the man responsible for it... would be a start.<eos> He completed the raid when my friends tried to stop it.<eos> He chained those he felt most likely to revolt over the offense.<eos> Though, I imagine they know this.<eos> With what conditions?<eos> Two of them.<eos> They respect you, so they'll listen to you.<eos> I'd ask your help in mending this alliance, both with the men and women here and those elsewhere on the island.<eos> I understand there's now a band of armed slaves out there.<eos> I need to know you can broker a peace with them, too.
I understand there's now a band of armed slaves out there.<eos> I need to know you can broker a peace with them, too.<eos> And the other condition?<eos> That he's alive at the end of whatever happens.<eos> You trust him?<eos> Flint.<eos> You've cast your lot with him.<eos> What does it matter to you?<eos> Before this war began, before everyone's roles changed, your father mistrusted Flint as much as anyone in Nassau did.<eos> I assume you were in some contact with him all that time.
It would have been so easy to lessen your suffering by divulging the secret.<eos> And yet, he never did.<eos> Have you yet asked yourself why that is?<eos> My father didn't mistrust Flint.<eos> My father mistrusted all of you.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> The cache isn't here, so I am leaving.<eos> And as my collateral to ensure that this deal is consummated, he'll be coming with me to the fort.<eos> "This deal"?<eos> As in the one in which you walk away with all my money?
In a matter of hours, there will be no safe place to stand on this island, made all the more dangerous by the fact that the harbor has been rendered defenseless.<eos> There will be no resistance to their landing since...<eos> Since Woodes Rogers was the one who invited them in.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Captain! Sails!<eos> The Walrus.<eos> They escaped the harbor ahead of their landing.<eos> Change of plan! Back to the ship.<eos> Spanish invasion.<eos> You're welcome to stay if you like.
In a few hours, the last remaining members of his regime will be surrendering the fort, leaving the island completely under our control.<eos> It is a new day.<eos> But one that demands we all unite behind a common cause.<eos> What cause is that?<eos> To free the new world.<eos> And we will be your partners... in the fight to free it?<eos> Yes.<eos> For how long?<eos> How long?<eos> I'm told you removed the one who governed the pirates before you.
Separate, and we all die.<eos> Retrieve your men, bring them here, and make this the last battle to win the island.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She left with an escort hours ago to make the exchange.<eos> You let her leave?
Handed you this victory.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> But what has begun here, there is no altering it now.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> I sent a rider to the Underhill estate to warn them.<eos> Told them we'd be here to get them off the island.<eos> But there's a credible argument to be made that we ought to leave right away, while we still can.<eos> No. We wait here.<eos> We wait here for whomever, if anyone, survives the day.<eos> If you have men you can spare, I can use them on the Walrus.
How else would they manage to enter it so cleanly unless he was in league with them?<eos> That is not what happened.<eos> Well, whatever the cause, they're here.<eos> We need to prepare a defensive position here.<eos> We need to send out scouts to determine the size of their force.<eos> And we need all the hands we can muster.<eos> Already?<eos> They must've tracked us here.<eos> Get inside the house, the both of you.<eos> You saw them?
You saw them?<eos> I think so.<eos> Beyond the trees.<eos> Wait.<eos> Now.<eos> Move! Move!<eos> If they report our position, we'll face 50 more of them.<eos> Stay. Watch the house.<eos> It did affect me.<eos> When Mr. Scott... when your father told me that you and your mother had died... it affected me a great deal.
You have men positioned by the south and west gates?<eos> As many as we could afford, which isn't many.<eos> What's happening out there?<eos> I don't know what chance you'll have.<eos> Their soldiers are likely everywhere.<eos> If you're going to be found by them, it shouldn't be tied up like an animal.<eos> You cannot stay here.<eos> Good luck.<eos> What is it?<eos> Can you hear that?
Gather whatever supplies you can.<eos> Anyone who can't make it to the beach, I want them carried.<eos> I'll not leave anyone behind.<eos> We've done most of what we can and still be able to depart quickly, which we may have to do sooner or later with or without survivors.<eos> We have to assume the Spanish have men all across the island by now.<eos> Every hour we sit here is an hour closer to being sighted by them... if we haven't been sighted already.<eos> She saw Anne?<eos> We'll give them another hour, then we'll set sail.<eos> Seems a fair amount of resentment towards you these days.<eos> I just want you to know... that I remember what you did for me.
What's north?<eos> Eleanor Guthrie's grandfather.<eos> We'll be arriving soon.<eos> Still no sign of Rackham?<eos> No.<eos> Do you really think they just...<eos> Abandoned us?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I need you to know... that I did everything I could to keep her safe.
I'm sorry.<eos> I need you to know... that I did everything I could to keep her safe.<eos> I don't expect that to mean anything.<eos> It wasn't... your fault.<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> They had already begun to arrive when Kofi came with your request for the cache.<eos> You can understand why I didn't let him go.<eos> They came from other islands, the colonies, maroons from camps like this one, pirates from as far away as Massachusetts.<eos> They heard that Nassau had fallen... and they came to join us.<eos> The revolution you promised... has begun!
Nassau.<eos> Thereabouts.<eos> A few days over the horizon, just waiting for us.<eos> Can't you see it?<eos> After I just climbed that fucking hill, are you being serious right now?<eos> In a few weeks time, I will lead a pirate fleet of unprecedented strength over that horizon into a battle of unprecedented importance.<eos> With a little luck, that battle will end with us taking Nassau and beginning a revolution.<eos> I cannot do it without you.<eos> So it would benefit all involved, you not the least, if, when the battle begins, you aren't killed by the first fool lucky enough to swing a sword your way.<eos> You wanna teach me to fight?

But for pride to be an issue between you and I... well, I...<eos> I think we're playing past that by now. Don't you?<eos> Do you really imagine a few weeks of this is going to make much of a difference?<eos> Am I not what I am at this point?<eos> It's better than nothing.<eos> Right.<eos> You're not concerned about this?<eos> Concerned?<eos> Well, you say you'll be teaching me to fight.<eos> But if every man fights differently, seems to me what you'll really be teaching me is how to defeat you.
But I don't think we're going to have that long.<eos> He gave me the time for his benefit, not mine.<eos> He's preparing to make a move.<eos> I know not what, but he's preparing for it.<eos> And there's little I can do about it until I secure that chest and have it to bargain with.<eos> Which one of them is going to prevail?<eos> Which one?<eos> Mr. Silver assures me he can retrieve the cache from Flint and resume our transaction on its original terms.<eos> If he is incorrect... I will have some difficult choices to make.<eos> You know the two of them.
You know the two of them.<eos> Now that they're facing each other as opponents,<eos> I'm asking what sort of outcome I should expect.<eos> Silver has the men.<eos> And...<eos> Flint is on his own out there and disadvantaged.<eos> That said...<eos> Flint's been on his own and disadvantaged countless times since I've known him.<eos> And here we are.<eos> Suppose what I'm saying is... if I were you, I would assume the worst... and act accordingly now while you know you still can.

I'd like to see her again.<eos> She'll never accept your offer.<eos> You are, for now, a necessary evil here.<eos> Do not test my patience.<eos> Bring her up from below.<eos> Now.<eos> What's this?<eos> We tracked him this far, but the trail splits in two.<eos> Well, it seems he may intend to divide our numbers, improve his chances.<eos> If they say you know his mind as if it were your own, we thought you might have a better idea which way he went than we could.
He's right.<eos> Flint likely seeks to separate them, gain an advantage.<eos> I know.<eos> So it's likely you've just sent one of those two groups to their death.<eos> As long as they expose his position.<eos> I wonder if he knows... just how much you learned from him.<eos> Your opponent's wrist is from whence the attack is born.<eos> It is its past tense from which it cannot separate itself.<eos> The end of the blade, where the attack arrives, is its present tense, which also cannot be denied.<eos> You're still watching my eyes, which is a good way of getting yourself killed.

I think I just did.<eos> You know all there is to know.<eos> I was born in Whitechapel, never knew my mother.<eos> I had a wholly unremarkable youth. - Spent most of it at a home for...<eos> - Home for boys. I know, I know.<eos> You... you told me once or twice of your experiences there.<eos> Except it isn't true.<eos> Is it?<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> I remember when you first told me, it sounded like a... invention.
- Home for boys. I know, I know.<eos> You... you told me once or twice of your experiences there.<eos> Except it isn't true.<eos> Is it?<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> I remember when you first told me, it sounded like a... invention.<eos> About one story that bled into others I'd heard told elsewhere to the crew.<eos> I didn't think much of it at the time. I suppose I assumed that if you ever became somebody worth knowing, I'd learn the truth of it eventually.<eos> Only... in this moment, I'm realizing that never happened.<eos> And what is of some concern to me is that... despite how invested we each are in the future of the other... you just told me that story again.

You know my story.<eos> Thomas, Miranda, all of it.<eos> Know the role it played in motivating me to do the things that I've done, the things I will do.<eos> It has made me transparent to you.<eos> Not only that, but when I told you this story, you insinuated yourself into it.<eos> The latest in a line of ill-fated partners, situating yourself such that... were you and I ever to come to blows...<eos> I'd be forced to hesitate before doing you any harm.<eos> - Slow down, I...<eos> - I'm not angry with you.<eos> It's just... you know my story.
I...<eos> I understand your concern. I just...<eos> We'll resume tomorrow. Is that all right?<eos> We found him.<eos> I don't see the chest.<eos> Track marks go back 200 yards.<eos> He dragged it here.<eos> Should we fetch Mr. Hands?<eos> We should head back.<eos> You sailed with Avery.
Track marks go back 200 yards.<eos> He dragged it here.<eos> Should we fetch Mr. Hands?<eos> We should head back.<eos> You sailed with Avery.<eos> Long time ago.<eos> 20 years?<eos> More, even, maybe?<eos> More, aye.<eos> You do know where you're going, yes?
Is that so?<eos> I've watched you and yours handle the account since I and mine left it.<eos> Accomplish things that no one I ever sailed with could dream of.<eos> From what I've overheard, if you reach Skeleton Island, might mean the end of the governor.<eos> Maybe keep the account alive a little while longer.<eos> Is that so?<eos> That and more.<eos> Then I'll take you to it.<eos> Hold on to this for as long as you can, for all of us who once had it... and walked away.<eos> You have no idea the restraint this takes.

Or with those who would follow him?<eos> You're luckier than you know... so much luckier than you know that in this moment I can still hear the faintest of voices in my head arguing against the alternative.

I've offered you freedom for your people.<eos> I have offered you more than you have any right to expect.<eos> And still, you will not say yes.<eos> So I come to you one last time, to ensure you cannot say no.<eos> - Accept the treaty...<eos> - I will consider no treaty of yours.<eos> And John Silver lives.<eos> Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.<eos> The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.
But I hear other voices.<eos> A chorus of voices.<eos> Multitudes.<eos> They reach back centuries.<eos> Men and women... and children who'd lost their lives... to men like you.<eos> Men and women and children forced to wear your chains.<eos> I must answer to them and this war... their war...<eos> Flint's war... my war... it will not be bargained away to avoid a fight,<eos> to save John Silver's life... or his men's... or mine.<eos> And you believe what you will, but it was neither I nor Flint... nor the Spanish raider who killed your wife.

More.<eos> He never would have got this far ahead of your men carrying that chest.<eos> The chest was never here.<eos> He left it behind.<eos> You think they'll figure it out that we dropped it down here?<eos> We need to get it in the ground.<eos> Come on.<eos> Heard some talk in the camp before we left.<eos> They were talking about what happens when it's over... if the war ends up what everyone says it will be... about the spoils we all stand to gain from it.<eos> But what you're talking about is bigger than that, isn't it?

I have no story to tell.<eos> It all might seem as though I'm trying to conceal something from you, but... truth is... there is no story to tell.<eos> No one's past is that unremarkable.<eos> Not unremarkable, just... without relevance.<eos> A long time ago, I absolved myself from the obligation of finding any.<eos> No need to account for all my life's events in the context of a story that somehow... defines me.<eos> Events, some of which, no one could divine any meaning from... other than that the world is a place of unending horrors.<eos> I've come to peace with the knowledge... that there is no storyteller imposing any coherence, nor sense, nor grace upon those events.<eos> Therefore, there's no duty on my part to search for it.<eos> You know of me all I can bear to be known.

Lay our attention on the latter.<eos> Hey, the hold's on fire!<eos> What happened?<eos> Men in the water!<eos> Launches in the water!<eos> From the Eurydice!<eos> Good God.<eos> Don't wait for me!<eos> They'll be upon us soon.<eos> You'll have to put it in the ground.
He'll be here in a moment.<eos> You still think you'll persuade him to see this all your way?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> But I'd prefer not to find out.<eos> That's enough!<eos> Tell me where it is.<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> Where is it?<eos> - You're making a mistake. - Fuck you!
In the ground... where it stays until Madi is freed, and we gather it and return it to the camp, all of us.<eos> I know you cannot see why this must be.<eos> But it must be.<eos> And every moment we waste is a moment we could be working to retrieve her.<eos> That's all this has ever been, isn't it?<eos> A partnership only insofar as it enables you to do whatever it is that matters to you in any given moment.<eos> And right now it matters far less to you whether she lives or dies than it happens your way, on your terms.<eos> I think you know it's far more complicated than that.<eos> I'm certain she does.<eos> Even if you could kill me, even if that somehow helped you see her alive again, how are you going to explain it to her?

[Angelica] Will...<eos> Will... [man] The chairman obviously regrets not being able to attend, but he had an urgent matter in Beijing.<eos> [man 2] Please thank your boss for his cheap champagne and even cheaper excuses.<eos> [man] Our budget is ten percent of what you spent on a military drone program.<eos> [man 2] We have the authority to de-fund this experiment.<eos> [man] What we're promising is accuracy, immunity.<eos> [man 2] You've been promising it for years.
Will! Will!<eos> It's okay. You're okay.<eos> - [gasping] - It's okay.<eos> I've got you.<eos> You're safe.<eos> ...and you should probably be talking to.<eos> Thank you for taking the time to help us.<eos> No problem.<eos> Happy to talk with folks who don't keep asking me - if this is going to be on the test.<eos> Grace said you were writing a thesis on early hominoids?
Grace said you were writing a thesis on early hominoids?<eos> We're interested in the branch-off point between Homo sapiens and other early ancestors, like the Neanderthal and Homo sensorium.<eos> Sensorium?<eos> Now that's a term I don't hear often.<eos> Sounds like you don't believe they existed.<eos> Well, there's certainly not enough data in my field to support the theory, but I'm a bits and bones gal.<eos> If you ask someone like Professor Kolovi, a geneticist at University of Chicago, he's likely to have a different opinion.<eos> I've read his book.<eos> My condolences for that lost time.<eos> You don't agree with him?
"Be careful what you wish for"?<eos> [man] Lito!<eos> Hello. How are you?<eos> Nice to see you guys.<eos> I am reporting for Kobi Kihara.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I'm Jela. - Hello.<eos> Where can we find the man they call Van Damn?<eos> The man they...<eos> You sure not Jela?
I don't know her name. I don't know who she is.<eos> Lito Rodriguez.<eos> Long time no see.<eos> Mariana, thank you for coming.<eos> What have you been up to?<eos> Well, I... I am very excited about the premiere of this film.<eos> It's one of my favorites.<eos> Would you care to comment on the scandalous photos of you that recently went viral on the Internet?<eos> Wow, Mariana, no friendly chit-chat, just right for the jugular.<eos> - So you're the famous Van Damn?
And what is your name?<eos> - And this is your matatu? - Oh, yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you denying the photos are real?<eos> No, no, no. I did not say that.<eos> So are you a homosexual?<eos> It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.<eos> Can you explain to me why it matters?<eos> It matters to your fans.<eos> If you are lying to them, they have the right to know.
No. I don't watch movies like that.<eos> - [chuckles] Movies like what?<eos> - Movies that glorify violence.<eos> Movies where the white man saves the world.<eos> Lionheart is not about any of those things.<eos> - It's about courage. [laughs]<eos> - Courage.<eos> I am very grateful to my fans.<eos> I know that, as an actor, all I tried to give them is something true, is something from my heart.<eos> Then you were lying to them before?
- It's about courage. [laughs]<eos> - Courage.<eos> I am very grateful to my fans.<eos> I know that, as an actor, all I tried to give them is something true, is something from my heart.<eos> Then you were lying to them before?<eos> Lito, come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Is this your lover then?<eos> Sorry, I didn't recognize him with his clothes on.<eos> Do you...

Because labels are the opposite of understanding.
- Where I'm from?<eos> - Do you mean where I'm from?<eos> - What I one day might become?<eos> - Where I'm from?<eos> - What I do? What I've done?<eos> - What I do?<eos> - What I dream? - What I dream?<eos> What I do? What I've done?<eos> - What I do? - What I've done?<eos> Do you mean... what you see?

Big moment coming up.<eos> [man in movie] It's El Caido.<eos> You said he would come for you.<eos> A man must never be judged by the length of his gun or the size of his fortune.<eos> In the end, we'll all be judged by the courage of our hearts.<eos> Hello again.<eos> Hi.<eos> Look, I feel like I owe you an apology.<eos> Oh, no. Not at all.<eos> I do, because I haven't been able to stop thinking about what you said and how it applied to my own life.

I'm afraid I might be growing accustomed to a certain lifestyle.<eos> You might have to keep murdering gangsters for me.<eos> There are worse professions.<eos> Right on cue.<eos> Enjoying yourselves?<eos> I'm Sebastian Fuchs.<eos> The King of the North.<eos> - May I have a seat?<eos> - It's your club.<eos> I want you to feel welcome and respected here.
To be honest with you, Felix, I don't like many people.<eos> Most people suck.<eos> They pretend, lie.<eos> They do anything to manipulate and control the situation around them.<eos> In a world such as this, the most precious thing a man can find is loyalty.<eos> I know how loyal you are to your friend and how loyal he is to you.<eos> I admire that kind of loyalty.<eos> What do you think about this club, Felix?<eos> What do I think of it?<eos> Are you kidding me?
- Good.<eos> It's yours.<eos> - What?<eos> I'll have my lawyers prepare the paperwork in the morning.<eos> You can sign them at my place.<eos> I'll see you there.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He just... gave me the club.<eos> [Zakia] I think I used to be able to think the way that you do.

Mounting evidence however suggests that it was not an accident nor a failure of adaptation.<eos> Our cousins' untimely demise was the result of a rather extended and brutal genocide.<eos> And what's more, the children of these barbaric murderers - are actually sitting right in this room.<eos> And standing at this podium.<eos> What happened to the Neanderthal?<eos> To the Denisovans?<eos> To Homo asiaticus and naledi?<eos> Homo sapiens happened.<eos> [chuckles] We came along and we wiped all of them out.<eos> [Kolovi] So I've been told you're working on a thesis concerning the evidence for Homo sensorium.

- [Nomi] That's right.<eos> - In your book, Being Human Beings, you argued for their existence.<eos> Does that mean you believe they could still be existing today?<eos> [laughs] Look, if you ask me what I know as opposed to what I believe,<eos> I know we've inherited some important bits of DNA from our ancestors and as I suggested in my book, what we gained from the sensorium, the insula of the frontal cortices, which is fundamental to our capacity for empathy, isn't just any part.<eos> Some would argue it is the best part.<eos> Can we ask you about one of your students? Dr. Matheson.<eos> Matheson?<eos> Names.<eos> Now you're testing me, Ms. Keene.
Not much of a socializer.<eos> That's him.<eos> What about him?<eos> You don't happen to know how we could reach him?<eos> We found a paper he wrote and we were wondering how he came to some results.<eos> No idea.<eos> Probably haven't heard from him since he left.<eos> When was this, the '80s?<eos> My God, look how young I was.<eos> Now, if you have other questions, you can leave them with my assistant.
The Will Gorski who used to be a cop.<eos> The Will Gorski who came to this island.<eos> The Will Gorski who wanted to save Ms. Gunnardottir.<eos> That Will Gorski is dying.<eos> If he's not already dead.<eos> Your concern's real touching, Milt.<eos> Oh, and that was really slick on the island bait.<eos> Did I blink?<eos> Take a breath?<eos> Or was I faking it... to make you think we are still on some island that we have left months ago?

It is not a game.<eos> This is a war.<eos> This room... is a fake.<eos> My suit is a costume.<eos> This whole place is calculated to make you think I am somewhere I am not.<eos> These people are... professionals.<eos> And you are a fucking amateur.<eos> Now it's my turn.<eos> - Is it ready?<eos> - We know you never left Iceland.
The jar of skyr?<eos> We even know the fucking farm it came from:<eos> Three Sisters.<eos> But none of that is as colossal a mistake as you hiding here.<eos> Is it a church?<eos> So like your mother.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Do it now.<eos> [Whispers] There are very few empty buildings like this one on an island so small.<eos> It won't be long, you'll hear the sound of a helicopter... and then she's mine.
And you know I trust you.<eos> - And I worry.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Please.<eos> What am I supposed to say to this woman?<eos> This is, um, gonna sound really weird and really awkward and totally inappropriate and I apologize in advance but...<eos> You've seen my daughter.

I just couldn't understand it and, uh... they call my name... and I look up and she was there.<eos> It had been a long time, but, uh...<eos> Sara was there.<eos> Then I remembered.<eos> I remembered why I was there.<eos> We know Sara through Will.<eos> How is he?<eos> He's been better.<eos> Is he here now?<eos> Will... I hope you find some peace.
Then I remembered.<eos> I remembered why I was there.<eos> We know Sara through Will.<eos> How is he?<eos> He's been better.<eos> Is he here now?<eos> Will... I hope you find some peace.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He says, "Thank you."<eos> You said there were others who came to talk about Sara?
Go back to sleep.<eos> This is it!<eos> Right.<eos> Vitals.<eos> Nomi!<eos> [Wolfgang] Come on.<eos> Hurry.<eos> [Kala] Almost... [gasps] [man] Let me be clear, I don't trust you anymore. Do you understand?<eos> Don't mind me, Milton.<eos> Are you even listening to me?
- Croome.<eos> Richard Wilson Croome.<eos> I'm compromised.<eos> Your last breach of protocol is still costing us millions of dollars in Iceland.<eos> I'm compromised.<eos> I... I have to go.<eos> - Gibbons!<eos> - I have to go!<eos> Gibbons!<eos> You think you're hunting us?
Not looking so good there, Milt.<eos> Trouble sleeping?<eos> I've been sleeping great, thanks for asking.<eos> Clever, Mr. Gorski.<eos> You mean, for a Chicago cop.
What are you hoping to accomplish here, Will?<eos> Blackmail?<eos> No, hardly.<eos> Guys like him...<eos> guys who live behind walls like this, they get the rules.<eos> You know them, you own them.<eos> Told ya.<eos> All right, Mr. Gorski.<eos> Here I am.<eos> You went to a great deal of trouble, Mr. Gorski, to bring us to this point.
- I want it without old Milt here creeping around in my head.<eos> I said every word.<eos> - Nom?<eos> - Should I use his private number?<eos> I would.<eos> What he's asking for is unacceptable.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Sir, it would be a critical mistake.<eos> I am the only advantage in this situation.<eos> From my position, Mr. Gibbons, you've exaggerated your value.
See, this is exactly what we needed.<eos> A nice dinner out, remember what it's like to be normal again.<eos> Prisoner 773, get your stuff.<eos> Come on, up!<eos> Get your uniform.<eos> - Come on, get up. Now. Hurry.<eos> - Stay there.<eos> Come on.<eos> There's my Angels!<eos> You both look so damn hot!
That's my man.<eos> Have you seen that?<eos> You there.<eos> Volume down.<eos> Are you a Bayern man?<eos> No, no, not at all.<eos> No, I own several players on both teams.<eos> I'm interested in talent, not games.<eos> That's why you are here.<eos> Would you like to have a drink?
And speaking of talent, allow me to introduce my extraordinary right hand.<eos> I would be lost without her.<eos> Lila Facchini.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> - Lila is Neapolitan.<eos> - Italian?<eos> Neapolitan.<eos> Lila, would you mind grabbing the contracts from my desk?<eos> Not at all.<eos> So you're just going to sign a huge club over to people you barely know?
The last owner never danced, he never drank, never partook in any of the reasons you go to a club.<eos> - Sounds like a waste.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> How do you run a restaurant without ever eating the food?<eos> I don't imagine you will make the same mistake.<eos> Want to play?<eos> Knowing me, I'd find much bigger mistakes to make.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> I see this as a tremendous growth opportunity for both of us.<eos> We just came here because we thought you were jerking our chain.

International money laundering. Big scale.<eos> Oh, you're good.<eos> How big?<eos> Billions.<eos> Pretty big.<eos> He's afraid that a gang war would be bad for business.<eos> Help me and I promise to make it worth your while.<eos> We might be interested.<eos> - Cheers. - Cheers.<eos> Oh, trust me, you will not find anything better at this price point.
- It's coming. In the room.<eos> Cars.<eos> - There's cars in the room.<eos> - Parking? - No.<eos> No, no.<eos> All our inside spots are already taken, but there's adequate street parking.<eos> "Adequate." An appropriate word.<eos> It... it looked bigger in the pictures.<eos> Yes, a tiny bit.<eos> You said you had one with a balcony?

An appropriate word.<eos> It... it looked bigger in the pictures.<eos> Yes, a tiny bit.<eos> You said you had one with a balcony?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> It's very charming.<eos> I'm showing it tonight.<eos> Can we see it?<eos> If you insist.
Yes, a tiny bit.<eos> You said you had one with a balcony?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> It's very charming.<eos> I'm showing it tonight.<eos> Can we see it?<eos> If you insist.<eos> And, uh, how much did you say this one is?<eos> Beyond your limit.<eos> But you can clearly see why.
- But rising?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> Epigenetic factors.<eos> So, does that mean anyone can be born sensate?<eos> No.<eos> Angelica could explain it more clearly, but it's genetically encoded.<eos> If it's a genetic disposition, does that mean Angelica identified specific genes?<eos> I know you've all got a lot of questions, but shouldn't we prioritize a little?
- Hey, there's Riley.<eos> - Museum surveillance cameras.<eos> Move, move, move!<eos> Move! Move! Move!<eos> Sir! Sir! Sir!<eos> Stop it right there! Sir!<eos> Please exit the building!<eos> Ready for me?<eos> Please exit the building!<eos> Ma'am, you have to leave the building.
Don't look at me.<eos> That's a nice piece.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Crush your enemies!<eos> That's, uh, Sanjay, the CI minister.<eos> - I'll go say hello. Be right back. - Okay.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah, fine.<eos> Hey, check this out.<eos> You like it?
Soo-Jin said you have a heart as soft as a baby bird.<eos> It was what made me like you the moment we met.<eos> Part of me wants you to find your brother and make him pay for what he has done.<eos> I know that part of me would enjoy your revenge.<eos> Whatever you do, child... do not let it be at the cost of your beautiful heart.<eos> [man] This kind of polyphony requires an abandonment of self so that I can release the boundary or loosen the boundaries of that self while writing so I can become someone else temporarily, imaginatively.<eos> [man 2] We just listen to so many voices where we're exposed to so many more different people than even our parents were.<eos> We get more images in a single week than people a hundred years ago would've seen possibly in their lifetimes.<eos> Well, well, well. Let me guess.<eos> You're here to interview the real deal.

Manendra believed that's necessary for the long-term good.<eos> - [speaking foreign language] - On Van Damn.<eos> - Ken. What's going on?<eos> - The bastard raised the prices again.<eos> Most of my people can't afford it anymore.<eos> This is terrible.<eos> We all come here for the same reason.<eos> I don't think that's true.<eos> We obey no law but his law!<eos> You are either with us or against us!

You can have it when you pay for it!
- I think he's back.<eos> - Bendix?<eos> Probably figured out I'm not at the Women's Shelter anymore.<eos> - I don't want to lead him to the boat.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> Lose him.<eos> [crowd chanting] One truth!<eos> Neets!<eos> - I know you! I know you!<eos> - You're not one of us!
Those familiar with the story of those terrible strikes will understand the tragedy of what happened to your father.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My father was killed during one of the riots.<eos> - I'm sorry, Capheus.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Would you say that this tragic incident is what powers your desire for social justice?<eos> To be truthful, the thought has never occurred to me until now.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But surely the desire for justice lives in all of us.<eos> Few of us are willing to risk it just as you did last week.
My name is Lito Rodriguez.<eos> I'm an actor.<eos> So?<eos> I knew your son, Raoul.<eos> He interviewed me years ago.<eos> I know your face.<eos> Raoul found your movies...<eos> Cheesy?<eos> No.<eos> You underestimate yourself.
Raoul was always different.<eos> Even when he was very young.<eos> We were a family of journalists... my wife, Raoul, me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The truth was not a thing to be hidden or denied.<eos> Not under our roof.<eos> But to hunt for truth, you need a sixth sense for it.<eos> Journalistic intuition.<eos> In my 40 years, I never knew anyone with an intuition like my son.<eos> You and Raoul were lovers?
Wait, wait.<eos> I just think that... as an actor, it is important to be open to all kinds of experiences.<eos> Sure.<eos> [stammers] It was just... [sighs]<eos> Well, let's just say...<eos> you are my son's type.<eos> Señor Pasquale...<eos> Can I ask about his disappearance?<eos> I know he went to Chicago for a story.<eos> Do you know anything about it?
The woman in the picture was important to the story.<eos> Can you take pictures of all of this stuff and send it to me?<eos> Do you mind if I take pictures?<eos> Do you know her?<eos> Her name is Angelica.<eos> When my son was disappeared, the police said he was involved with drugs.<eos> I knew they were lying.<eos> When they came here, they were looking for something.<eos> They did not find it.<eos> You see?
Heavens.<eos> We just have some questions.<eos> Oh, my, my!<eos> What's all this about?<eos> Actually, one of your neighbors found these prison uniforms - in your garbage bag this morning.<eos> Familiar, are they?<eos> Yeah, of course they are.<eos> They used to be mine.<eos> The uniforms have numbers, Mrs. Cho.<eos> So you can just drop the innocent old lady act.

You and she were cellmates, weren't you?<eos> The only thing I hate more than rhetorical questions... stupid rhetorical questions.<eos> Harboring fugitives, Mrs. Cho...<eos> that's a serious crime.<eos> I don't want to have to put you back in prison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They were here.<eos> Okay.<eos> But they left last night.<eos> You can search the place if you don't believe me.

Raoul, is it you?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Listen...<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't know what an actor can do to help put the memory of my son to rest.<eos> But he obviously thought highly of you.<eos> I hope one day I share that same opinion.<eos> - Do you know where they were headed?<eos> - No.<eos> Would you tell me if you did know, huh?
Jonas.<eos> [Nomi] What's happening?<eos> There's something wrong.<eos> It's Jonas.<eos> I've come to say goodbye.<eos> I thought I had value to them, but it seems that time has passed.<eos> What's happening?<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> They're using me to send you a message.<eos> They want you to watch.
Me, too.<eos> Life on beta blockers... is no life at all.<eos> What?<eos> - We're not alone.<eos> - From last night?<eos> Aye, from last night.<eos> Though what drove me to such recklessness, I can't say.<eos> - I'm Riley and this is Will.<eos> - Oh, nice try.<eos> But you can just call me... the Old Man of Hoy.
Though what drove me to such recklessness, I can't say.<eos> - I'm Riley and this is Will.<eos> - Oh, nice try.<eos> But you can just call me... the Old Man of Hoy.<eos> What's his name?<eos> He doesn't trust us.<eos> Of course I don't trust you.<eos> I barely escaped with my frontal lobes from your wee disco.<eos> So did we.<eos> It seems like you took your blockers at the same we took ours.

Please, Dani, sit.<eos> Thank God!<eos> It smells so freaking good!<eos> I did it again, didn't I?<eos> We love how excited you get.<eos> We do.<eos> Family, I have something very important to say.<eos> This is my mother's special omelet.<eos> She would cook this for my father whenever he was missing Spain.<eos> You both know me well enough to know that when I am upset, I cannot listen to anyone or anything.
Hello.<eos> - Thank you!<eos> - My God! I'm one of your biggest fans!<eos> - Thank you very much. - Oh, where...<eos> - I love you so much!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> There is a schedule of events in your packet.<eos> - The parade kicks off after your address.<eos> My address?<eos> Only if you want.

What did he say?<eos> - He's not being very helpful.<eos> - Why, am I supposed to be?<eos> At Vincent's, you knew what blockers were and you didn't tell me.<eos> - Oh, I told you enough.<eos> - Tell him that we need help.<eos> If nothing changes, if no one figures out how to stop BPO, then one day he's gonna need the same kind of help.<eos> Over here, hero.<eos> Free advice:<eos> if you bump into one of our kind, assume that they are BPO collaborators.

Daddy, look what I made!<eos> Now this line describing the flank, that is sublime.<eos> Come, let Daddy get dressed.<eos> Good morning, Milton.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Secretary.<eos> The Chairman is very excited.<eos> It's a very big day for us.<eos> - It is.<eos> - We are counting on you.<eos> How are you feeling?
Love to talk, but my date's arrived.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Two of the goons were rentals.<eos> They'll go in, sweep the room, then head back out here.<eos> Ms. Facchini.<eos> Mr. Bohm.<eos> I was hoping it'd be you.<eos> Why?<eos> Fuchs doesn't see what you are.

You know, you never think about how ubiquitous immigrant food like General Tso's chicken and pepperoni pizza has become...<eos> Until you realize you're a different human species on the run from an evil organization trying to lobotomize you?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Did we make a mistake doing the concert?<eos> No.<eos> It just proved there's a whole bunch more of us out there than we thought, and that there must be some kind of an intelligence network because they all seemed to know who you were.<eos> We just have to try and figure out a way to get them to trust us.<eos> Aye, that's the rub, laddie.<eos> Mr. Hoy is back.<eos> What a charming little empty box you've chosen here.
Aye, that's the rub, laddie.<eos> Mr. Hoy is back.<eos> What a charming little empty box you've chosen here.<eos> All the modern amenities of a prison cell.<eos> Where are you visiting from?<eos> I call it my speakeasy 'cause you can speak easy in here.<eos> Soundproofing. Eighteen inches thick.<eos> All the modern amenities of a coffin.<eos> Aye.<eos> So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.

Maybe... after 30 years of surviving... not living, mind you, but surviving... maybe after 30 years of blockers, and coffins, and boxes... maybe I realized...<eos> I'm slowly dying of survival.<eos> I'm sick of this.<eos> - I'm done playing by the rules.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Mr. Hoy needs a reason to trust us.<eos> There you are, Mr. Hoy.<eos> Aye, well, you do not need to be Sherlock Holmes.<eos> If you're a headhunter or looking to make a deal with BPO, you know where to find me.
Be careful.<eos> Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters?<eos> Do you know him?<eos> If he's the one that's after you, I must say, I underestimated either your recklessness or your courage.<eos> What's his real name?<eos> I don't know myself.<eos> Not sure I want to know.<eos> When our kind have nightmares about BPO, they're usually about him.<eos> - Where do I find him?<eos> I do not ken where you get your brass goolies from, but maybe I'll be able to give you what you want.

Well, you get the gist.<eos> Sapiens invented Google in the 1990s.<eos> We've had it since the Neolithic.<eos> How long does it take?<eos> I'm looking for Cannibal.<eos> Get him on the phone now!<eos> I don't know what he thinks he's doing.<eos> This is my research, this is my project.<eos> Tell him I'm gonna straighten him out!<eos> I've got the answer, but I don't think you're going to like it.
Nom!<eos> Dr. Metzger.<eos> I don't know what they taught you in med school, but the word "helping" doesn't mean handcuff people and chop up their brains.<eos> Prep her for surgery.<eos> Nomi, what have you done?<eos> Is he in there?<eos> What is he doing?<eos> I told you, he's trying to destroy my work.<eos> I love you.<eos> You really believe that neurografting is possible?
Have you seen this?<eos> So many terrible things going on.<eos> I used to wonder if there was something<eos> I could do to try to change the world... before I understood such thoughts were unskilled.<eos> Trying to change the world only leads to suffering.<eos> All we can change is ourselves.<eos> I'm not sure I agree.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I can't help you.<eos> You weren't sitting in that seat before, were you?

- Some fucking dude not getting any.<eos> Violence has a gender.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I love your dads.<eos> I find it fascinating how every generation believes in different things.<eos> - We believed in pot. And sex.<eos> - [laughter] We were Black Panthers.<eos> - Oh, bad motherfuckers.<eos> - Now we cook quinoa.<eos> Oh, come on now. You all were more interested in pussy than politics.
Are you going to tell me... I should trust in the law?<eos> No.<eos> My father was like your brother.<eos> The world is better off without them.<eos> I think I'm more confused than I was before.<eos> [Lito] There's no easy answer, Sun.<eos> Whatever you decide to do... just know you won't have to do it alone.<eos> Mr. Rodriguez, hi.<eos> - You cut your hair!<eos> - Excuse me. You don't have an appointment with him.
You said I was your guy.<eos> Well, you lied to us, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Can I offer an opinion?<eos> I came alone.<eos> I just want to talk. That's all.<eos> How did you know I would be here today?<eos> Well, I didn't.<eos> I've been here every morning before my shift.<eos> I guessed if you did come, it would be early.

Because I have seen your legal system from inside and out.<eos> And the last thing I would expect from it is justice.<eos> Look, Ms. Bak...<eos> I meant what I said to your teacher, okay?<eos> I'm on your side.<eos> We know that your brother is not the man the media believes him to be.<eos> We suspect a lot of illegal money is flowing through his company.<eos> We're just not able to prove it yet.<eos> Listen to yourself, Detective.<eos> Is this the system you serve?
Yeah.<eos> The law is imperfect.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me and I swear I will protect you.<eos> I don't need anyone's protection.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I promised I only wanted to talk, so I'm not gonna stop you if you prefer to leave.<eos> But... this today, may be my last chance for a rematch.<eos> May I propose a test to your invulnerability, Ms. Bak?<eos> - [scoffs] - A quick spar.<eos> If you win, you leave as you wish.

Exactly like that.<eos> Had enough?<eos> No, Ms. Bak.<eos> You're thinking too much, Detective.<eos> My teacher says the same thing.<eos> [sighs]<eos> After I lost an important match, he told me that I worry too much about what I should or shouldn't do.<eos> He says fighting is not something you do with your head, it's something you do with your heart.<eos> You agree with him, Ms. Bak?<eos> I think you will profit by spending more time with your teacher and less time pestering me.

- It's, uh... Do you think it's gonna be much longer?<eos> No.<eos> It could be tomorrow...<eos> it could be next week.<eos> Or it could be right now.<eos> Which it so happens it is.<eos> He's here?<eos> The Archipelago has spoken.<eos> I've been given an address.<eos> You must go there.

What happened?<eos> Everyone died.<eos> Not helpful.<eos> No.<eos> It is a test.<eos> They need to know that I'm alone.<eos> No.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> In five minutes, I send in Diego.<eos> I needed to know how far you would go.

Not since he met Dr. Milton Bailey Brandt.<eos> That's the first name I knew him by.<eos> When he came to the university, he had research, data on the development of the sensorium frontal lobe that we were all desperate for.<eos> Of course, we all suspected how he came about this information, but nobody wanted to ask.<eos> But still, Brandt never would have solved the problems of the neural graft without Angelica.<eos> Neural graft?<eos> It's mimics the connection of a cluster, overriding the consciousness of one sensorium onto another.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm an academic.<eos> Even when I heard you coming down the stairs, I wasn't sure I would be able to go through with this.
I remember the sound of bone saw.<eos> Then nothing.<eos> So you could be a Bolger. He could be a zombie.<eos> I believe that was the intention of our friend over there.<eos> I think you're the first cluster to get this close to Whispers.<eos> You continue to impress, Officer Gorski.<eos> Wait, if Whispers wanted you lobotomized, then who stopped the surgery?<eos> The only person in BPO with more power than him.<eos> - Are you talking about...<eos> As you can see, my status is much improved.
As if it matters.<eos> Lito. Lito, don't do it.<eos> Don't forget that every bite is the equivalent of 20 minutes on the treadmill.<eos> We're actors.<eos> Rejection is nine-tenths of our job.<eos> What job?<eos> I don't have a job.<eos> And I can't get a job because I don't have an agent.<eos> Why don't I have an agent?<eos> Because he could see what you both refuse to see.
I don't have a job.<eos> And I can't get a job because I don't have an agent.<eos> Why don't I have an agent?<eos> Because he could see what you both refuse to see.<eos> One of these days, that shit-for-brains is going to realize that dropping you was the sorriest, stupidest mistake he's ever made.<eos> Not a mistake. It's not a mistake, Dani.<eos> It's a reality.<eos> They accepted it.<eos> And I have accepted it.<eos> Now you two have to.
- She's your daughter.<eos> I want to go home! I want to go home!<eos> I have to work.<eos> Get out. Go.<eos> - Leave me the...<eos> - fuck alone!<eos> - Chelsea, come. - [voice echoing]<eos> Sometimes I don't know who you are!<eos> [voice echoing] Leave me the fuck alone! No.<eos> You're just as trapped as we are, aren't you?
You're just as trapped as we are, aren't you?<eos> [Lila] It's Sebastian.<eos> He's worried about your relationship.<eos> I told him I would talk to you.<eos> Okay. Let's talk.<eos> Rajan?<eos> [Rajan] You will stay the fuck away from my family!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I owe you nothing! Nothing!<eos> You're not gonna do anything!
I don't.<eos> I hate it.<eos> I hate being... controlled and forced to make deals and compromises I don't want to make.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> The killers could be anywhere.<eos> [Will] We need access to the restaurant computer.<eos> [Sun] How without Nomi?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Hello, Officer.<eos> I do believe you're in need of assistance.
Just stay the fuck away from me.<eos> Or what?<eos> I know things were difficult between you and your father.<eos> Maybe... Maybe you didn't go to your father because, in the end, he wasn't that important to you.<eos> Maybe you're not the son you thought you were.<eos> I can imagine facing that truth would be particularly painful.<eos> You and I? We are getting closer and closer, Will.<eos> Mr. Wrangler will see you now.<eos> Mr. Bak wants everything to be perfect.<eos> You are the face of his hospitality.

That crap is for accountants.<eos> I care about one thing and one thing only.<eos> You touch me here, I'm yours.<eos> You don't, I don't care how many fans you have, you mean less to me than the shit I took this morning.

I watched your speech, and I felt, "Maybe, maybe, this is my Jordi."<eos> So, do you, uh... do you know the scene?
I'm guessing he already told you what he did with his.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Mr. Huntington, we're huge fans of your work.<eos> Huge. Like...<eos> Like The Glass Blower is a postmodern masterpiece.<eos> I teach it to my university students back home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, that's very kind.<eos> Hernando, Dani, please, don't embarrass the man.<eos> And you are?
For too long... we have elected promises.<eos> For too long, we have elected liars.<eos> And hypocrites.<eos> We have elected thieves.<eos> The time has come to elect a real man.<eos> I give you, from the Kenya Democratic Reform Party...<eos> Capheus "Van Damn" Onyango!<eos> Just drive the bus.<eos> Hello.<eos> I thought if you were going to vote for me... you should know a few things about me.
I thought if you were going to vote for me... you should know a few things about me.<eos> Once, a Kikuyu woman... and a Luo man fell in love with each other.<eos> They were urged by both of their families not to marry outside the tribal boundary, but... love is a bridge and not a wall, if we let it be.<eos> They became husband and wife.<eos> At first, they lived with my father's family in Ahero, but I'm afraid the Luo village found a hundred ways to make the new bride feel as if she was a trespasser.<eos> So, when I was only a few months old, my parents went to live in the village that my mother was born.<eos> Now it was my father's turn to be made to feel like he was an outsider who did not belong.<eos> My parents had to leave their homes... to find a city where no one knew them.<eos> The same prejudice that drove them away... was also responsible for taking my father's life when a political difference became a tribal war.<eos> I share this story because you have heard many rumors about me... and I felt it was time to explain who and what I am.
I was about to give up, but... I found it.<eos> I found the one.<eos> Many of us spend our lives searching for the one.<eos> For Teagan and Tom, the search has come to an end.<eos> Marriage is a sacred union.<eos> It is a rite uniting individuals into a family.<eos> - It bonds two minds. - I always cry at weddings.<eos> - It bonds two hearts and souls.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> You came here today before us as two.

You said it worked.<eos> It did work. You saw it worked.<eos> I knew this.<eos> I knew this was going to happen.<eos> Mom, Dad, do something.<eos> It's your own fault.<eos> I told you not to include him.<eos> No.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> If you want to finish your sacred rite, get out of the way.
Prove it!<eos> Show us the warrant, Agent Bendix.<eos> I have the arrest warrant right here.<eos> He doesn't have a warrant.<eos> Of course I have one.<eos> Dad?<eos> - Agent Bendix...<eos> - Nomi Marks is wanted by at least three different agencies in the federal system.<eos> I trust that you are familiar with the law firm Winslow, Wise, Allegretti Marks?<eos> I sincerely hope that you're going to show me the warrant.
I trust that you are familiar with the law firm Winslow, Wise, Allegretti Marks?<eos> I sincerely hope that you're going to show me the warrant.<eos> What did you do?<eos> She did something!<eos> She did some kind of hacking!<eos> This is bullshit!<eos> Take your hands off my daughter... or I promise you, I will pursue a suit seeking the kind of damages that end the careers of men like you.<eos> Pull yourself together.<eos> Apologies for the, uh, theatrical misunderstanding.<eos> Minister, if you please.
That's really weird synchronicity.<eos> But, hey, timing is everything, isn't it?<eos> Yeah. Okay, sure.<eos> Put him on.<eos> Hello, Kit.<eos> I know.<eos> I felt it, too.<eos> I believe in this project.<eos> I believe it was destiny.<eos> I can't wait for you to meet him.
Um... sure. Yeah.<eos> A nice fixer-upper Raj has got himself here.<eos> Um, you really didn't have to do this.<eos> If I can be frank, Mrs. Rasal... I met Raj quite a bit after your wedding, and it never occurred to me, not once.<eos> But the moment I saw your reaction to the fact that I hadn't been to your wedding, I realized the scale of my mistake.<eos> This is what they mean I think by...<eos> the "civilizing nature of women."<eos> - I mean, everyone makes mistakes.<eos> But I think it's important to make amends when appropriate.<eos> As I said, you really didn't have to.

I've been meaning to talk with you.<eos> It's terrifying, isn't it?<eos> The president and I have a simple request.<eos> Tell us what you see.
I've been meaning to talk with you.<eos> It's terrifying, isn't it?<eos> The president and I have a simple request.<eos> Tell us what you see.<eos> If anything in your environment strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off, pick up the phone.<eos> Whether it's a package or a person that seems out of place, we'd love you to let us know.<eos> Because there's a lot of noise out there these days.<eos> A noisy press that's choosing to dwell on the past instead of what's happening right now.<eos> My husband and I want to protect you.<eos> In two weeks' time, you will be heading to the ballot box to decide what kind of country you want to live in.

And I also do not care about your investigative committees.<eos> No, that is not what I care about today.<eos> The House will cease.<eos> That is not what I care about today.<eos> I am on my way to the funeral of an American patriot.<eos> A good man, a husband... a father... who was beheaded on American soil.<eos> And this chamber chooses to debate me?<eos> - The House will suspend. - I asked to speak to a full session of this chamber and my requests were denied.<eos> - Madam Speaker!<eos> - Mr. President, you must yield the floor.

At large.<eos> How much more proof do you people need?
Like FDR before, and Wilson before him. I demand that this Congress declare a formal declaration of war against ICO, both here and abroad.<eos> Motion to adjourn.<eos> - Second!<eos> - The House will adjourn.<eos> - The president will cease.<eos> - I will not cease!<eos> I will never cease.<eos> I demand that this Congress declare a state of war has existed and does exist between ICO and the United States of America.<eos> And I demand that every member of this House stay in this chamber for as long as it takes, until you bring my request to a vote.<eos> Or you will all go down in history as cowards!
- Please.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> - Did you take your medicine?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay?<eos> You do. You think about what you would say on a day like today.<eos> If a day like today were to happen.<eos> But you let it pass... because you know you have so much more left ahead of you.<eos> So much to do together.<eos> You think... You think 40 minutes...
- Honey...<eos> - Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> I need to...<eos> I wanted to say about my father... He was so strong... so brave.<eos> My father was taking us to...<eos> My father...<eos> - Come on, baby.<eos> It's okay. - My father...<eos> You killed my father. You're the reason he died.

Yes, sir.<eos> - Quite a crowd out there.<eos> - Well, we better bring Birch in first. Yes, sir.<eos> Congressman Birch.<eos> Bob.<eos> Well, that was a little bit of history this morning, wasn't it?<eos> - It certainly was.<eos> - I couldn't see it any other way.<eos> No disagreement from here.<eos> Well, you know how the Republicans are.
- Charlie, if I may...<eos> Tom, please, what are you implying?<eos> This request for a declaration of war is yet another distraction.<eos> And I've never been prouder of the president than I am today.<eos> I'm not denying what happened to the Millers.<eos> It was a tragedy.<eos> No, but you are. Because denying it is the tragedy.<eos> This is a pattern.<eos> Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood, - continues to operate in the shadows. - Tom...<eos> I understand you believe in the importance of your article. And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.
Mrs. Underwood, the White House has yet to release one piece of information about the attempted capture of those domestic terrorists.<eos> ICO terrorists, yes.<eos> Reports from a few hours ago are saying North Carolina or Virginia. But that's all we have.<eos> Well, we are circling in, we're getting closer. I will tell you, our intelligence community, they are the real heroes.<eos> Charlie, if we could get back to my point, my sources confirmed... Tom.<eos> Heather Dunbar, no friend of mine or my husband's, looked into these charges, and cleared the president.<eos> Cleared?<eos> Please.<eos> The White House has not had a single press briefing since the Herald ran my article.<eos> You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.
The Underwoods are no longer campaigning.<eos> They can call it what they want.<eos> Well, if you think about the last few days, what's in the air... It might not be such a bad idea for us to take it one handshake at a time.<eos> Or call it for what it is.<eos> "Home and abroad."<eos> The president is essentially asking for permission - to fight a war on our soil.<eos> - We can't push back too hard.<eos> We can't afford to look soft on terror.<eos> We can't look the other way, either.<eos> You of all people know where this kind of talk leads.
There are other campaigns.<eos> - If you can get into the NSA...<eos> - That's not possible.<eos> Into their system, you can fix this.<eos> - You're not listening to me.<eos> I know the Underwoods.<eos> The only way that we are gonna survive this... is if they win.<eos> You can help them win.<eos> I know you can.<eos> I got on the paper right around the time you left.
I know you can.<eos> I got on the paper right around the time you left.<eos> Did you start in Style?<eos> Metro desk.<eos> But then I did this piece, a street fashion, kids on the street thing.<eos> I'm surprised you asked for me.<eos> Some people are being moved around and off the team.<eos> The Masterson story.<eos> "War, what is it good for?"<eos> Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?

I'm a little nervous.<eos> You're sort of a legend and... articles on the president?
- I lost him somewhere. - But he's not...<eos> But still, monsters do exist, don't they?<eos> I want my lawyer.<eos> What for?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.<eos> I don't know why I say anything anymore.<eos> I wanted to see you... to ask you a simple question.<eos> Didn't you know what was going on in your home?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - You knew... even before he went to Pakistan.

He got lost.<eos> - But no, nothing like this.<eos> - But you saw what he did, didn't you?
- Would you like to see it? We can show it to you, if you like.<eos> No.<eos> Please don't.<eos> What he did to that family, to that man...<eos> What sort of person would do such a thing?<eos> He's my son.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I know. It's awful, isn't it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> When you leave today, there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.

It's awful, isn't it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> When you leave today, there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.<eos> But you don't need to say very much.<eos> You just need to ask Josh to turn himself in.<eos> There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there.<eos> This could've happened to any of them.<eos> We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson, and I will do my best to have you see him.
I want to go.<eos> No one's keeping you.<eos> But who did she put in? Who did the Speaker put on the committee?<eos> Mostly lifers, with secure seats.<eos> We're two weeks out. It's hard to say no to war.<eos> You and I have some things in common.<eos> - We both dislike the president.<eos> - No. I'm still a Democrat.<eos> Who leans to the right.<eos> Alex, you do actually lean a little to the right.
Well, I'm a big fan of American law enforcement.<eos> They'll find him soon enough.<eos> We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation that's always looking over their shoulder.<eos> If you can get yourself onto that committee, I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.<eos> My driver will take you back to your car. But, Congressman... this is your chance.<eos> And I think you know it.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out here.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out.<eos> Great to see you. Thanks for coming out.<eos> You have no idea what is happening in your own homes.
- And if the Republican candidate and the rest of his party refuse to acknowledge the seriousness of the threat made here at home... know that we will.<eos> The FBI is currently gathering a list of words and images.<eos> If they appear on your children's or your coworkers' devices, please...<eos> War whore!<eos> - Move!<eos> - Car!<eos> It was just paint. She's all right.<eos> And what else?<eos> Spit it out, Doug. It won't taste so bad.<eos> Sir, I know you disagree with me on this. But Director Green and his team have a location for the takedown and they're ready to act.
All we have are some loose domestic connections. A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.<eos> He refuses to confirm any wide-ranging homegrown network.<eos> Our interrogators are confident the asset is no longer valuable.<eos> And risk to reward no longer tenable.<eos> Sir, we have reached a breaking point.<eos> Did you think I didn't already have him?<eos> That I would have left him out there somewhere?<eos> And I thought you knew me.<eos> Josh.<eos> Do you want to live?
And risk to reward no longer tenable.<eos> Sir, we have reached a breaking point.<eos> Did you think I didn't already have him?<eos> That I would have left him out there somewhere?<eos> And I thought you knew me.<eos> Josh.<eos> Do you want to live?<eos> Tell us what we want.<eos> Tell us what we want to hear.<eos> You're no martyr, are you?
That I would have left him out there somewhere?<eos> And I thought you knew me.<eos> Josh.<eos> Do you want to live?<eos> Tell us what we want.<eos> Tell us what we want to hear.<eos> You're no martyr, are you?<eos> Look at you.<eos> No, you're not a martyr.<eos> No one will remember what you've done, either here on Earth or in your heaven.
She saw you.<eos> She looked right through you, didn't she?<eos> I don't need to see this person anymore.<eos> - Get rid of the asset.<eos> - Sir. He's an animal, but he's still an American citizen.<eos> We are at war.<eos> And he is an enemy combatant.<eos> And he lost whatever rights he might have had as an American when he cut that poor man's head off.<eos> So don't give me your pride or your position.<eos> Because none of this would have happened if you'd done what you were told in the first place.
I'll take care of it.<eos> Yes, you will, and you will do so willingly.<eos> And I want you to get some good, usable footage... of his killing.<eos> And then destroy everything else.<eos> We will be releasing footage of Joshua Masterson's killing.<eos> The administration and the intelligence community were hoping to take him alive. But I would like to commend<eos> Assistant Director of Counterterrorism, Nathan Green. And of course all of the work that Secretary Durant has done behind the scenes on all of this.<eos> The information the investigation has gathered so far points to Joshua Masterson and Zachary Hawthorne having strong connections to ICO abroad and ICO's growing network domestically.<eos> And so I would like to say this to ICO directly.<eos> You will not infect the mind of one more of our young people, because I will not stop until I find you.
The committee is looking for Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.<eos> What do either of them have to do with ICO or the war?<eos> The talk up on the Hill is they're going to invite you and the rest of your staff to testify.<eos> They're gonna use the Declaration of War to investigate.<eos> That's right.<eos> They're gonna use the committee Frank asked for to investigate him.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - That's right, Doug. "Fuck."<eos> It's difficult to underst...<eos> Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.
No... not dawn.<eos> If you want somebody... You take me.<eos> Nana, are you down here?<eos> No! Nana?<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nana, I can't get the door open. It's shut!<eos> Nana?<eos> Nana?<eos> Trust me, you've made the right decision.
If you want somebody... You take me.<eos> Nana, are you down here?<eos> No! Nana?<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nana, I can't get the door open. It's shut!<eos> Nana?<eos> Nana?<eos> Trust me, you've made the right decision.<eos> You two will be so happy here!
I'd shake, but it's kinda dirty down here.<eos> Got it.<eos> So, listen, you don't seem to have any problem with your heating.<eos> Good furnace. Built to last.<eos> Apparently, there was a fire here a couple of years ago and a girl got burnt pretty badly.<eos> I wouldn't go sticking your face in there.<eos> These suckers get pretty hot.<eos> Damn hot.<eos> Yeah, well, if we were to replace this one, how much would it cost?<eos> Well, I'll let you know when I'm done with my assessment.
Yeah, well, if we were to replace this one, how much would it cost?<eos> Well, I'll let you know when I'm done with my assessment.<eos> Just trying to figure out where all these pipes lead.<eos> Lot of pipe down here.<eos> Okay, we'll leave you to it, and you'll let us know when you have an estimate?<eos> Will do.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Same here.<eos> Oh hey, you wouldn't happen to have a key to this door, would you?<eos> You see, this pipe up here goes through the wall into there and this door, it's stuck, locked or something.
I am all over that.<eos> We haven't been out in quite a while.<eos> Okay, you wanna go upstairs and change, and we'll take my car?<eos> Yes, I will go change.<eos> Uh, okay, he's acting fucking weird.<eos> He's trying to be on best behavior.<eos> I suggest you do the same.<eos> We're changing our plans for you. Don't forget that.<eos> Without a reservation, it's gonna be a few minutes.<eos> You may wait at the bar, if you wish.
I'm ready to have some fun.<eos> Hi.<eos> - What would you like to drink?<eos> - I'll take a red wine, please.<eos> - A Cuba libre.<eos> - Red wine, Cuba libre.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Tell me about this guy you're seeing.<eos> What's he like, what's his name?<eos> Oh, excuse me, do you work here?
I do, but unfortunately, I just started my ten minute break.<eos> His name is Patrick.<eos> Someone else here would be happy to help you.<eos> Oh, I don't want someone else.<eos> I just want you.<eos> What the hell is your husband doing?<eos> He's probably just trying to get us a table earlier.<eos> - Cabernet. - Yeah, that's totally what he's doing.<eos> Can I let you in on a little secret?<eos> You couldn't have me if hell froze over.
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah. It was my fault.<eos> - Don't worry about that.<eos> I'll recover.<eos> - Are you Mrs. hemdale?<eos> Yes, can I help you? No.<eos> But I think I can help you.<eos> You're living in the house, aren't you?
The accident with the furnace. You're the girl.<eos> It was no accident.<eos> There's something evil living in that house.<eos> Have you been in the cellar?<eos> Have you seen the black room?<eos> Leave!<eos> Take your husband and get out!<eos> It'll try to seduce you, trick you with pleasure, make you want more.<eos> It feeds off human desires.<eos> But, if you're not careful, it will literally eat you alive.
I didn't mean to raise my voice, but the girl went through a traumatic experience.<eos> She lost her grandmother. She nearly lost her face, she's probably not thinking too clearly.<eos> And what about all that family history you so graciously spewed out at dinner, last night?<eos> Rumors.<eos> Just rumors, probably started by that silly girl, dawn black.<eos> Maybe so, but I'm gonna find out what's behind that door.<eos> Who you calling?<eos> I told you, Monica, the realtor.<eos> I wanna see if she's got a key.<eos> Oh, Bob, margot, you're nice and late.
- Howard, Stacey...<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - We're here for your house warming party.<eos> Surprise.<eos> As far as I know, she was the previous owner.<eos> She's really pretty.<eos> So, who else did you invite, honey?<eos> I invited Karen, and the plumber and the electrician.<eos> Who knows? They may all pop up later.<eos> This is a marvelous house, and at that price, you two made out like bandits.
I won't let you have him!<eos> Fight it! Harder!<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> - Jen? Jen, what happened? - I lost you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> That doesn't look good.<eos> Get up!<eos> It's starting to give birth.<eos> You've gotta get out of here, now!
You think we can get our old apartment back?<eos> So, I know it's been a while, but I'm still feeling the effects of that house.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Well, maybe tonight we can do something about it, now that everything's back to normal.<eos> I meant to tell you, we may have a problem.<eos> Not everything's back to normal.<eos> It did that to you?<eos> I think I can handle it.<eos> Let's make a baby.<eos> Trust me, you've made the right decision.

Just so happy here.
- Come on through.<eos> He won't be a minute.<eos> Morning, sir.<eos> A body's come up below Magdalen Bridge.<eos> The clothes match the description of a missing person from a month ago.<eos> Professor Neilsen from Lovelace College.<eos> Angler. Uniform are on scene, but they'd like us to take a look.<eos> Suspicious?<eos> You never know.<eos> Well, you can handle that, can't you?
Well, you can handle that, can't you?<eos> Drop me by the tobacconist on your way.<eos> Don't forget I'm out tonight.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Are you? - I told you. Keep fit.<eos> - I'll leave you something to warm through.<eos> - Right.<eos> I should hear about my Sergeant's exam today.<eos> Results are out.<eos> - You'll be off, then. - Well, no.
Passions are inclined to run a little high on the eve of an important experiment such as ours.<eos> That's right.<eos> The rest of the time, we're just one big happy family.<eos> This gentleman is from the police.<eos> He's here about Richard.<eos> They've found a body in the Cherwell.<eos> - What?<eos> - Good God, no!<eos> It's a mistake, surely?<eos> You're... sure it's him?
- What?<eos> - Good God, no!<eos> It's a mistake, surely?<eos> You're... sure it's him?<eos> We recovered this from the body.<eos> It's Richard's.<eos> I gave it to him.<eos> Had anything been troubling him?<eos> Well, he was under enormous pressure with work, but, er, otherwise...<eos> You think he killed himself?
Gone to lunch.<eos> - Good heavens!<eos> What's this?<eos> - Wimbledon, sir.<eos> Ladies highlights in colour.<eos> It's quite lifelike.<eos> As may be, but this is a police station, not a television showroom.<eos> Fell off the back of a lorry, sir.<eos> Just making sure it's still working.<eos> - Morse, when you have a moment...
Don't suppose there's any need to ask what that's about, with the new suit.<eos> - Fingers crossed.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Failed?<eos> The Board notes with regret that a number of examination papers never arrived for marking and were, therefore, classed an automatic failure.<eos> Better luck next time, yes?<eos> One more thing.<eos> There's a Russian arriving at Lovelace College tomorrow for the chess tournament.<eos> It's Special Branch's bailiwick, but Division want the local force represented.<eos> You've some Russian, I believe, from your time in Signals.

If there were any way to find out, I'd be interested to know.<eos> Number two?<eos> That's a waste of good luncheon meat.<eos> Not today.<eos> It will be.<eos> Tuesday.<eos> I don't know what it is, but it's not luncheon meat.<eos> Well, erm, I'm off to see Dr deBryn.<eos> The body we took out of the river this morning I'd be glad of your eye over it.<eos> No, you're all right.

Some kind of beauty treatment maybe?<eos> - And the other?<eos> - Well, it's turned mostly to liquid, but she had some sort of alkali residue in her ears and up her nose.<eos> Face pack, perhaps?<eos> Women do use them, I believe.<eos> Thanks, Doc.<eos> There wasn't anything like that in the cubicle, and it's not like they'd had a chance to tidy it.<eos> Have you been to her home yet?<eos> Not yet. Why?<eos> I'll take it off your hands if you like, save you the job.
Still, what was it you said?<eos> "If at first...", eh?<eos> Hello.<eos> Detective Constable Morse.<eos> - City Police. Miss...?<eos> - Er, Tessa Knight, Oxford Mail.<eos> I'm on a death knock.<eos> Give me a break or my editor'll have my guts.<eos> I know Miss Frazil of old.<eos> Tell her you ran into Morse and he was very unhelpful.

- You mind your place.<eos> - What is that, exactly?<eos> My place?<eos> Your place is where I say it is.<eos> No more and no less.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Just don't go making something out of nothing, that's all.<eos> - It's what we do, isn't it?<eos> - It's what you do!
I'll come in early.<eos> I thought you said he was a seasoned angler.<eos> A Minister's Dog is eccentric, even by our standards.<eos> The name of the fly.<eos> There are more vulgar appellations.<eos> - Such as?<eos> - The Vicar's Bitch, for one.<eos> Legend has it the fly was fashioned using hairs from a cleric's Labrador.<eos> - Why eccentric?<eos> - You can take trout on it, but traditionally it's a salmon fly.
I'm just cashing up.<eos> Detective Constable Morse, City Police.<eos> There was a woman found dead in the slipper baths.<eos> Which cubicle would that have been?<eos> It was cubicle two.<eos> Professor Gradenko, may I introduce my driver,<eos> - Woman Police Constable Trewlove?<eos> - How do you do?<eos> And Detective Constable Morse.<eos> If you're ready, Professor...
Not seen much of you since the Wessex raid.<eos> When are you gonna give me the inside story?<eos> I'm sure you've spoken to everybody else.<eos> She's gone away, I believe, to recuperate.<eos> You all right?<eos> You don't look as though you've been sleeping.<eos> You've lost weight.<eos> You're not in love, are you?<eos> On my wages?<eos> Gentlemen, if you take your places, the tournament can begin.
Hello.<eos> - Kent writes whodunits.<eos> - Crime fiction, Doe, please.<eos> A bastard form of literature, but mine own.<eos> He'd like to pick your brains.<eos> Well... such as they are.<eos> Don't be deceived. He hides it well, but Morse is the cleverest man in Oxford.<eos> Oh! I'm cut to the quick.<eos> Second-cleverest, then, now you're here.<eos> You play?
Oh! I'm cut to the quick.<eos> Second-cleverest, then, now you're here.<eos> You play?<eos> Er, yes, a little.<eos> - You?<eos> - Some.<eos> Er, it's why I'm here.<eos> Research for the next novel.<eos> I've rented a place for the summer.<eos> You must come over.

I keep a pretty descent cellar.
I'm a Lowlands man, myself.<eos> Red brick and chippy with everything.<eos> But, seriously, you must come over. I keep a pretty descent cellar.<eos> I'm sure whatever state it's in it's better than my own.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Oh, well, listen, how about eight o'clock?<eos> - Oh, do you mean this evening?<eos> - Well, that'll be nice.<eos> Well, look, perhaps we could have a blitz after.<eos> You know, in honour of our respective almae matres.

The question now is whether he's prepared to accept the exchange of knights in a bid to develop the centre.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I didn't mean...<eos> Four five six from Information Room.<eos> More to my officers than a...<eos> - Pretty face?<eos> - .. appears.<eos> I was going to say.<eos> Appears.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd please take your seats, the tournament is about to continue.
- Writing on the mirror?<eos> - What's it say?<eos> We're more interested in when it could have been put there.<eos> Well, could've been done any time.<eos> Well, the place is cleaned daily, isn't it?<eos> Usually, but we've been a bit short-handed this last month.<eos> So how many people used cubicle two after Miss Palfrey died?<eos> Nobody.<eos> We shut it up, out of respect.<eos> And of course, the bath needed a full hygienic, you know... It's, er, it's standard procedure.
So how could somebody have got in for a swim if the place is locked?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Who's got keys?<eos> Well, we have.<eos> - A set each.<eos> - What about past employees?<eos> We'll need a list.<eos> I'll talk to Mr Smedley.<eos> Staff records are held up at the council.<eos> Any case, that locker key you were after...
- He hasn't.<eos> This isn't E4, it's E5.<eos> F4.<eos> What's this?<eos> Somebody's idea of Take Your Pick?<eos> E4 and a bunch of envelopes, empty.<eos> - Swimming pool address.<eos> - Sick joke.<eos> I'll see if the staff know anything about it.<eos> This boy, connected to the other two, do you think?
E4 and a bunch of envelopes, empty.<eos> - Swimming pool address.<eos> - Sick joke.<eos> I'll see if the staff know anything about it.<eos> This boy, connected to the other two, do you think?<eos> It's not my place to say.<eos> Who knows? Right?<eos> Don't come the old acid.<eos> It don't suit.<eos> You didn't listen.
Mona by name...<eos> Yeah, she'll vouch.<eos> All right, Mr Mitcham, I can take it from here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's a route through the boiler room to an unsecured service hatch.<eos> Recent footprints in the dust, how Edison got in, presumably.<eos> I'll get a photographer down there.<eos> Finish up here, then you and Trewlove bring his parents in.<eos> I'll see you back at the station.<eos> You weren't concerned when he didn't come home?
Edison always said it was that club that kept him on the straight and narrow.<eos> When he got older, he wanted to help other youngsters, like himself, to keep out of trouble.<eos> He got on all right with his mates, did he, at work?<eos> Oh, yes, sir.<eos> Everybody liked Edison.<eos> Does my boy look all right?<eos> Because I don't want his mother seeing him if he's...<eos> Like he's sleeping, Mr Smalls.<eos> Just like he's sleeping.<eos> You think somebody did this to Edison?
He got on all right with his mates, did he, at work?<eos> Oh, yes, sir.<eos> Everybody liked Edison.<eos> Does my boy look all right?<eos> Because I don't want his mother seeing him if he's...<eos> Like he's sleeping, Mr Smalls.<eos> Just like he's sleeping.<eos> You think somebody did this to Edison?<eos> If they did, sir, we'll have 'em.<eos> No stone unturned, you have my word.
That's check mate in 15.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cheers!<eos> And again. Cheers!<eos> Cheers!<eos> - One, two, three. Cheers!<eos> - Cheers!<eos> Oh, come on, old chap.<eos> Napoleon's dictum.<eos> This cigarette case that you gave Dr Nielsen...
A girl can't just be friends with a chap.<eos> It's has to be sex.<eos> Or love.<eos> In my experience, as many kill for love as desire.<eos> Could anyone have misread your friendship with Dr Nielsen?<eos> Look, my only role here and my only interest is looking after my father.<eos> No-one's bought me flowers or made a pass at me or sent me billets-doux.<eos> Beautiful, yes?<eos> Richard was fond of water lilies.<eos> You knew Dr Nielsen?
You knew Dr Nielsen?<eos> A remarkable young man.<eos> I was very sad to hear of his death.<eos> We exchanged letters for several years.<eos> Chess, you understand.<eos> It is your responsibility to find out who killed him.<eos> He drowned.<eos> In my country, people drown also.<eos> Sometimes, even by accident.<eos> You have to catch the person who killed Richard Nielsen.

Perhaps speak to Bernard.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yes, I argued with Richard.<eos> We overspent our research budget by quite a margin.<eos> And that caused conflict between you and Dr Nielsen?<eos> He was convinced someone was making something on the side, demanded to see the accounts.<eos> - Did you give them to him?<eos> - No.<eos> I think he took them just before he disappeared.<eos> There you are.

I've been looking for you.<eos> So, come on. Foul play, right?<eos> Look, you can tell me.
Get his name right, at least for his parents' sake. It's Edison Smalls.<eos> Workmates all called him Danny or Daniel.<eos> He only got Edison at home.<eos> So, this Aston or Ashford, what about them?<eos> Miss Palfrey may have been closer to the doctor than his wife cared for.<eos> There was a divorce.<eos> My source says it was some kind of local cause celebre. Made the papers.<eos> Thanks you for the steer.<eos> Splendid. Splendid. Yeah.<eos> Well, I wasn't sure if you would come.
But her likeness caught the imagination of fashionable Parisians and, well, by the Yellow '90s, no self-respecting Bohemian garret could truly lay claim to being part of La Belle Epoque without one.<eos> So, erm, yeah...<eos> Right, shall we?<eos> This way.<eos> It must be fascinating work, pitting your wits against some diabolical villain.<eos> The red herrings.<eos> I don't know, the unexpected twists in the final act before the killer is revealed.<eos> It might be that way in books.<eos> In real life, it's all legwork or paperwork, asking the same questions over and over.<eos> Would you...?
In real life, it's all legwork or paperwork, asking the same questions over and over.<eos> Would you...?<eos> Would you like me to change the music?<eos> I gather opera's more your bag.<eos> Oh, look, don't think too badly of her.<eos> Dorothea holds you in some regard.<eos> How is it you know her?<eos> Oh, she reviewed my last Superintendent Jolliphant rather favourably, so I sent flowers to thank her, and we stayed in touch.<eos> And as I was in Oxford, er...<eos> You're friends, then?
Fetch the paper.<eos> Change is as good as a rest.<eos> Here, give us one the unexpected defeat of the Russian scientist<eos> Professor Yuri Gradenko by the computer JASON in a chess match at Lovelace college.<eos> Professor George Amory, who led the Oxford Team, predicted that within a generation few compartments of the intellect would remain outside the machines' realm and that the problems of creating artificial intelligence would be substantially solved.<eos> We're no closer to catching this bastard, and now the whole world knows about it.<eos> We'll have every nutcase and lunatic in Oxford to claim responsibility and no way to sort the wheat from the chaff.<eos> Tessa!<eos> Come here.<eos> This story, where did you get it?
Are you accusing Miss Knight of stealing it?<eos> Because, if you are, I'd like the Mail's lawyers present.<eos> If I find this chit of yours does have Morse's notebook, I'll have her up before the beak so fast her feet won't touch the ground.<eos> Whatever professional courtesy you may have had of me hitherto,<eos> - do not look to rely upon the same in future.<eos> - Professional courtesy?<eos> - I thought we were friends.<eos> - We were.<eos> Running off at the lip in front of a scribbler!<eos> - I thought you knew better.

Knocking it back at 11 in the morning, washed up in some provincial backwater.<eos> One more word, and you're fired.<eos> I resign.<eos> The Sketch saw my piece.<eos> If I can come up with another one like it, there's a job waiting for me there.<eos> That's right.<eos> Fleet Street.<eos> London!<eos> Good luck.<eos> Next time you see my name, it'll be on page one.
Tread lightly, child.<eos> Tread lightly.<eos> After local newspaper the Oxford Mail revealed that a murderer who kills his victims by drowning is at large in the city, Chief Superintendent Reginald Bright of the Oxford City Police declined to comment.<eos> Losing one's notebook is about as gross a dereliction of duty a serving officer can make.<eos> - An honest mistake, sir.<eos> - Honesty doesn't come into it.<eos> - I will thank you not to speak for him.<eos> - It's why I'm here, sir.<eos> Well, you've had your say.<eos> You asked me to find out how many examination papers went astray.
- I will thank you not to speak for him.<eos> - It's why I'm here, sir.<eos> Well, you've had your say.<eos> You asked me to find out how many examination papers went astray.<eos> I made enquiries.<eos> The answer was one.<eos> Just yours, Morse.<eos> Just yours.<eos> - I see.<eos> - Do you?
Well, you've had your say.<eos> You asked me to find out how many examination papers went astray.<eos> I made enquiries.<eos> The answer was one.<eos> Just yours, Morse.<eos> Just yours.<eos> - I see.<eos> - Do you?<eos> I wonder.<eos> This past three years, you've made some very powerful enemies.
Just yours, Morse.<eos> Just yours.<eos> - I see.<eos> - Do you?<eos> I wonder.<eos> This past three years, you've made some very powerful enemies.<eos> They won't forgive and they won't forget.<eos> They mean to dog your steps until the very last hour of your service.<eos> And now this...<eos> If you want my advice, your best hope of salvaging any kind of career would be to transfer to another constabulary.

You've no family local.<eos> As I understand it, there's nothing to keep you here.<eos> Scotch before lunch?<eos> I thought you said it gave you guts-ache?<eos> How did you leave it?<eos> One step forward.<eos> Now, look, that with Miss Knight...<eos> Go on.<eos> - ...it wasn't just a one-way street.<eos> - What did you get from her?
Go on.<eos> - ...it wasn't just a one-way street.<eos> - What did you get from her?<eos> She told me that Miss Palfrey worked for a doctor's family out by Binsey, name of Aston or Ashford.<eos> Now, I've had a look in the Gazetteer.<eos> I can't find anyone with either name currently in Oxford.<eos> Electoral rolls, then.<eos> It could take days to collate and cross-reference that material.<eos> Yes, but there is another possibility.<eos> Can you do it? Morse said you ran a demonstration of the new postal coding system for the GPO.
We might get a better result if we start with just "A-S", the first two letters being shared by both surnames.<eos> Sure, Dr Gould?<eos> Wouldn't that give us anyone whose surname begins with A-S in Oxfordshire?<eos> Binsey should narrow it.<eos> Sooner that than miss a variation. Double-barrelled, even.<eos> So, how does it work, Dr Gibbs?<eos> The program's written in Forbin 66, with a few additions of our own.<eos> There!<eos> Well, now what?<eos> Now you can sample Broderick's disgusting home-ground, or do what I'm going to do.

See if any of the names ring a bell.<eos> There should be a handbag.<eos> Constable?<eos> She was a reporter, wasn't she?<eos> She'd need somewhere to keep her notebook.<eos> Her coat is here.<eos> I can't see her going far without a handbag.<eos> That poor girl.<eos> I should've listened to you.<eos> Well, you had... things on your mind.

She died in '62.<eos> I've spoken to the Royal Army Medical Corps.<eos> They're searching for him in regimental records.<eos> - There's a son and a daughter.<eos> No names...<eos> - Actually, sir, just through from the station, Edison Smalls' previous.<eos> Three months suspended for a fight with a lad he used to play chess with down the youth club.<eos> Alexander Leighton-Asbury.<eos> I've spoken to Edison's parents.<eos> They were just playing a game, nice as you like.
Alexander Leighton-Asbury.<eos> I've spoken to Edison's parents.<eos> They were just playing a game, nice as you like.<eos> Edison said something to the Leighton-Asbury boy, and he went for him.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - Something he didn't like, clearly.<eos> But push come to shove, it was Edison got stuck on and the other kid walked away.<eos> I'll get a trace out for him.<eos> Right.<eos> You'd better get over to Miss Knight's flat, take a look.
You'd better get over to Miss Knight's flat, take a look.<eos> This is her room.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Er, she was a fan, that's all.<eos> Look, what...<eos> What's this all about?<eos> What it's about, Mr Finn, is Tessa Knight lying drowned in an outsized fish tank over by Binsey, with a death mask of her face staring down at her from the wall.<eos> It's about your muse being just such a death-mask, cast from the features of a woman drowned in the Seine 80 years ago.<eos> But above all, it's about finding one of your pipe-cleaner men on her bedside table.<eos> You were sleeping with her.
That would accord with what we read in her diary.<eos> So what happened to him?<eos> Sent away.<eos> Family somewhere.<eos> I think the parents split up not long after. I can look into it.<eos> I'd be grateful.<eos> Poor Tessa.<eos> She'd an idea about some job in Fleet Street on offer, if she got the scoop on all this.<eos> Last thing she said was,<eos> "Next time you see my name, it'll be on the front page."

Been there recently?<eos> Binsey?<eos> Good God, no.<eos> Wouldn't know where to find it.<eos> Easy enough to find an address, as you've already demonstrated.<eos> Why the interest in Leighton-Asbury?<eos> The body of a young woman was found drowned at the house in Binsey this morning.<eos> Tessa Knight.<eos> That's awful.<eos> But if you think Dr Leighton-Asbury's got anything to do with it, you're way off-beam.
Tessa Knight.<eos> That's awful.<eos> But if you think Dr Leighton-Asbury's got anything to do with it, you're way off-beam.<eos> - How's that?<eos> - Well, I'm a scientist.<eos> I don't go in for God.<eos> But that man was a miracle worker.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> For the record.<eos> You know where I was, I told you.
Where were you last night?<eos> For the record.<eos> You know where I was, I told you.<eos> I went to a recital and then I went home to bed, for the record.<eos> - Anyone vouch for that?<eos> - No.<eos> What about Tuesday night?<eos> I was here, working.<eos> Bernard told me to reboot JASON.<eos> Look, if you think that you've got evidence that I'm involved in all of this, then you should charge me.
We're looking for Dr Bernard Gould.<eos> Erm, you just missed him, about half an hour since.<eos> - Any idea where he might be? - Home.<eos> He was feeling under the weather.<eos> Gibbs said Dr Gould told him to reset JASON the night before the tournament.<eos> - Would that be regular?<eos> - Yes, JASON had been behaving erratically.<eos> It's standard practice.<eos> You close the machine down and restart it.<eos> You turn it off and on again.
A birth registered in the second quarter of 1939.<eos> Penelope.<eos> Perhaps we should try the swimming baths.<eos> Maybe he's taken her there.<eos> Tessa Knight's coat did reek of chlorine.<eos> Out.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - Where's who?<eos> Miss Frazil.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
Out.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - Where's who?<eos> Miss Frazil.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - What have you done with her?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Get him dressed.<eos> Morse, with me.<eos> Show me where you found those footprints.
Get him dressed.<eos> Morse, with me.<eos> Show me where you found those footprints.<eos> Maybe he's got her down there.<eos> Morse!<eos> Miss Knight's handbag!<eos> "Rook takes knight.<eos> Check Mate."<eos> It's not Gibbs.<eos> - You think Dr Castle is the Leighton-Asbury boy? - Yes.
The envelopes in the locker were mail.<eos> The Oxford Mail.<eos> He's been telling us his next move at each instance.<eos> He must know we've found the house in Binsey.<eos> What about the boat house where his sister drowned?<eos> - What's his motive?<eos> - Miss Palfrey he knew as a child.<eos> Same as Edison Smalls.<eos> Perhaps it was something to do with his sister.<eos> You sit in your offices writing your stories.

It's all right!<eos> I'll get you out!<eos> Please, open the door!<eos> - Fred! - I'm not leaving you.<eos> - Argh!<eos> - It's OK. Don't worry.<eos> Fred, please!<eos> Out you get!<eos> Quick!<eos> If she wanted you dead, you would be.
For what?<eos> Another?<eos> Yeah, Robert gave jt $140,000.<eos> I thought you knew. No, nope.<eos> Jt didn't tell me that.<eos> He didn't tell me a lot of things.<eos> - You know what? Let me call the girls.<eos> - No!<eos> We can put something aside for you under the radar, maybe open a little shop in town or get a place in Tahoe.<eos> You don't have any kids, you could just start over where nobody knows you.

Bus will be back at 5pm sharp, take them back to home sweet home.<eos> Welcome to the prep program, miss Davis.<eos> Bratt, they're all yours.<eos> - Thanks for doing this, holt.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> Gentlemen, get ready to be kicked, bitten and bucked off.<eos> The most important lesson you can learn here is Patience.<eos> These are wild animals, they've never interacted with humans before, so you're going to have to earn their trust and respect.<eos> You're gonna be handling them, training them.<eos> You are not listening to me, Irish!

You really took charge of those men.<eos> Makes me wonder if you were a prisoner or a guard.<eos> You'd like to know what I did to get in there, wouldn't you?<eos> No...<eos> Yeah, sure, do you want to tell me?<eos> Goodnight, Stella, see you in the morning.<eos> Everything's gonna be just fine.<eos> Guys, roll camera.<eos> Okay, your sister is already here.<eos> You look great.
Guys, roll camera.<eos> Okay, your sister is already here.<eos> You look great.<eos> Rolling!<eos> Meredith, tell us why we're here.<eos> The object of our mission is to save these animals and our moral and ethical integrity is on the line here.<eos> - All right.<eos> - We got that.<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> - Thank god you're here.
If you get impatient or rough with this mustang, mustang's gonna come out on top.<eos> Just like you and chopper in the shower, cupcake.<eos> Hey, man, get me out of here.<eos> Why I gotta go first, man?<eos> Take a breath and focus on the horse, he's more scared then you are.<eos> He's never seen a human before.<eos> Go on over there and try and touch him gentle on the muzzle with the back of your hand.<eos> Just like chopper.<eos> Debrickshaw, focus!<eos> If you can't get your hands on that horse, how are you gonna saddle him?
Just calm down, everything's gonna be okay.<eos> That's it.<eos> Hey, look, man, i know you don't wanna be in here.<eos> - Keep talking to him.<eos> - You cool?<eos> It's working, it's working.<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> Back off, slow.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, look here, man, look here.<eos> You don't wanna be here, all right, and you didn't do nothing wrong, you just got unlucky.

In a drought where there's no food or water?<eos> Where they overpopulate and starve to death?<eos> Exaggerations propagated by the ranchers.<eos> The New York times, science news, why would they lie?<eos> Because they sell ad space to the ranchers who don't want to share the grazing land that they have, because it'll lower profit margins.<eos> Exploiting defenseless animals is irrefutably wicked.<eos> I am here to protect them at any cost.<eos> So, if you don't stop what you're doing, I will make an example out of you.<eos> Don't get timid with this horse, Irish, you do, he's gonna eat your lunch.<eos> If you get bucked off, and everybody does, roll with the throw and you keep on rolling until you're out of the way.
Easy, easy, easy.<eos> Easy, easy there.<eos> Debrickshaw, take that.<eos> - Jon, Jon?<eos> - How'd I do?<eos> That was awesome.<eos> Come on, let's get you up.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Maybe you wanna take a minute between rounds, huh?
- Well, it sure looks like it.<eos> Equine slavery's got to go! I can't believe her.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Because I'll tell you something, no breeder's gonna come within a hundred miles of you with this kind of press.<eos> Meredith planted a story in the newspaper.<eos> She's trying to make me look like I'm some kind of animal abuser.<eos> Well, the way I see it, you got two choices here:<eos> You can sit there feeling sorry for yourself or show some grit and prove her wrong.<eos> Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Equine slavery's got to go!<eos> As you see, this ain't real easy.

Ho, ho! Equine slavery's got to go!<eos> As you see, this ain't real easy.<eos> So I want you to think before you act.<eos> What you think this horse needs?
Alright, get after it.<eos> Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Equine slavery's got to go!<eos> That's it, nice and gentle.<eos> In those spooky areas first.<eos> - There, across the flanks.<eos> - Go on, Matty.<eos> In the spooky area, yeah.<eos> Ooh, yup.<eos> - Keep moving, keep moving.<eos> - Ooh! Yeah, you got her now, Matt.
You know that government doesn't work that way, right?<eos> I've got orders to take them to the closest holding facility.<eos> So you're gonna take these horses away so they can spend the rest of their lives stacked on top of each other? Because of bullshit allegations whispered into a politician's ear.<eos> I have orders.<eos> These men may spend the night in jail. There may be guards all over the place. But when they're with these horses, they are free.<eos> And you're gonna take that away from them.<eos> I promise you, I promise you, these men would never hurt the horses.<eos> I need more than your word.<eos> Good enough for me.<eos> But if you're still waffling', buddy, take a look at this.
I suggest that you find a less expensive hobby and stop wasting my damn time!<eos> You have not failed.<eos> It's just time to recommit!<eos> Pull up your socks!<eos> Go!<eos> Alrighty. Save those horses!<eos> Come on, George b.<eos> That's it.<eos> Oh, you.<eos> I want so much for you to feel better.
So they all get a second chance.<eos> What I have seen in the last 90 days on my ranch has been magical, and I'm more proud of that than anything I have ever done in my entire life.<eos> So our horses will be auctioned off this weekend at the usa qha regionals.<eos> If any of you are interested in adopting, but let me warn you, they are gorgeous.<eos> Well, that's just about enough of that, isn't it?<eos> So let's get back to it, shall we?<eos> And, ladies, let's bring on the food and the booze!<eos> And let let's kick up the band, 'cause we all know why we're here, it's giving season!<eos> - Whoo!<eos> You sure about this?
- Mrs. Stella, that woman was here.<eos> She wanted to talk to you.<eos> So I feel like she didn't know anything.<eos> Oh, I gave her a piece of mind.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> - What was that about?<eos> - Meredith stopped by.<eos> I mean, what could she possibly be up to now?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> You must be one of those guys they're looking for.

No, man, they love our horses.<eos> Uh, yeah, right.<eos> Us and our horses.<eos> I think we're off to a start.<eos> Turns out I'm pretty good with horses.<eos> Yeah, pretty good.<eos> Really good.<eos> Really good, uh-huh.<eos> Pretty good.<eos> You deserved better, George b.
Listen!<eos> Stop!<eos> You silly fucking twit!<eos> Please!<eos> You are one stupid fucking bitch, you know that?
Stop!<eos> You silly fucking twit!<eos> Please!<eos> You are one stupid fucking bitch, you know that?<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> No.<eos> There you are.<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> You're a little shit.
Got it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Hyde.<eos> Ana, please, it's Jack.<eos> Tea, right?<eos> Weak, black.<eos> I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to get this for you, but thank you, Jack.<eos> Barbados is amazing.<eos> It's all coral and turtles and booze...<eos> You should be here.

Well, if I had asked, you would have been like, "I'm too shy."<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you...<eos> It's my best stuff.<eos> That's so...<eos> Do you like them?<eos> They are super large.<eos> Hold on.<eos> All the portraits have sold to one man.<eos> You're kidding!
You're kidding!<eos> No.<eos> Well, somebody likes them.<eos> They just bought all six.<eos> All six?<eos> Dinner's on me tonight, okay? Mmm.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Anastasia.<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> You just went and bought all of these?

I'm just here to encourage.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I think a round of drinks at Lori's would do the trick.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Meetings.<eos> Otherwise.<eos> Who's Lori?<eos> Oh, it's a bar around the corner.<eos> On. Fridays are a bit of a ritual.<eos> You should come.
All right.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Mmm. Thanks.<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> You know, it's still early.<eos> Your comments on boyce fox were interesting.<eos> I'm not usually into political thrillers.<eos> Yeah, well, I think the parallels with Dante's inferno are amazing, but...<eos> No.<eos> You convinced me.
No.<eos> You convinced me.<eos> I'm reading.<eos> That's great.<eos> Hi!<eos> Hey um, uh...<eos> Christian, this is Jack Hyde.<eos> I'm the boyfriend.<eos> I'm the boss.<eos> What will you have, Chris?

No.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> That girl that I saw this morning was one of them, wasn't she?<eos> Let's discuss this back at my place.<eos> I can have someone come by, do your hair.<eos> Christian, I don't care about my hair!<eos> Explain to me what's going on.<eos> I'll explain when we're there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay, you can either walk or i can carry you.

Oh, my god.<eos> Gail took her to the hospital, but by the time I got there, she'd taken off.<eos> My people have been trying to find her.<eos> Your people?<eos> Is that who put this together?<eos> Is there one on me?<eos> Let me see it.<eos> "Subject works part time at Clayton's hardware, Richmond road."<eos> You know, they didn't time my bathroom breaks.<eos> You should probably get your money back.

I didn't know you'd be different.<eos> Different?<eos> Really?<eos> Is that why you brought me to Mrs. Robinson's, where you brought all the other women?<eos> Because I'm so different?<eos> That was wrong.<eos> I admit.<eos> It's all wrong.<eos> All of this is wrong.<eos> You put money into my account that... I don't want it.

Woman". Mr. grey, your appointment's arrived.<eos> Okay.<eos> Send him into Ana's room.<eos> He's here.<eos> Who's here?<eos> Hair up, I think.<eos> Yes?<eos> Your neck is beautiful.<eos> Christian?<eos> You're just gonna stand there gawking?
He's here.<eos> Who's here?<eos> Hair up, I think.<eos> Yes?<eos> Your neck is beautiful.<eos> Christian?<eos> You're just gonna stand there gawking?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I think I might.<eos> So I was thinking tonight might be more stimulating if you wear these.

Bend over.<eos> No, you're not putting those in my butt.<eos> They don't go in your butt.<eos> Stay still.<eos> Stand up straight and turn around.<eos> How's it feel?<eos> Weird.<eos> But good.<eos> What do they do?<eos> You'll find out.
You'll find out.<eos> Wear the silver satin.<eos> It'll go well with these.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They're for your ears.<eos> Did I mention it was a masked ball?<eos> No.<eos> Your new bodyguards need to wear these, too?<eos> I'm just being safe.<eos> You won't even notice they're here.
Christian!<eos> I'm so glad you made it.<eos> Mother.<eos> "Mother" is so formal.<eos> Honestly.<eos> Ana.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing?<eos> These things are beautiful, and they are mysterious, but they're a pain in the ass.<eos> You look spectacular.
Ana.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing?<eos> These things are beautiful, and they are mysterious, but they're a pain in the ass.<eos> You look spectacular.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So do you.<eos> This dress is so beautiful.<eos> Thank you, Ana.<eos> I'm so glad you're back with Christian.
Ana!<eos> My god!<eos> That dress, it should be illegal.<eos> Monique lhuillier.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mia.<eos> Mia, you know i barely recognized you.<eos> Yeah!<eos> The new me.<eos> Okay, what do you think?

He got expelled from four different schools for brawling.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Yeah, totally out of control.<eos> - Mia, enough.<eos> - Mia?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Hi!<eos> How are you?<eos> H Mm? Ana?<eos> You will be sitting here, darling.
Working to make life better for the children... of parents addicted to drugs.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> And now, thankfully, I will be handing off my speaking duties to our master of ceremonies, Mr. nomad Paul.<eos> Paul". Thank you, Mr. grey, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Hungry?<eos> Let's start the bidding with lot number one.<eos> Ravenous.<eos> - Do I hear $10, 000?<eos> - Ten!<eos> Now you know what those silver balls do.
And now it'll go to someone who needs it.<eos> I don't know whether to worship at your feet or spank you.<eos> $24, 000.<eos> Going once...<eos> I think...<eos> Going twice... I'll take option two.<eos> Sold! To the young lady in silver.<eos> Your generosity really makes a difference, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You want this?

Let's go.<eos> They'll be missing us.<eos> Uh, I just need a minute.<eos> I'll meet you downstairs.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't forget your mask.<eos> under my skin<eos> I'd sacrifice anything come what might for the sake of having you near what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> comes in the night and repeats and repeats in my ear don't you know, little fool you never can win
Without me, he'd be in jail or dead.<eos> And he would say the same.<eos> I'm not listening to this.<eos> Do you think you're the first woman he'd hoped would save him?<eos> He needs a submissive in life.<eos> Not "gust 'm the bedroom.<eos> No, he's changing that.<eos> It's not what he wants anymore.<eos> But it's what he needs.<eos> And you don't strike me as the type of woman who wants to be owned.

Sir?<eos> Stay here.<eos> We'll have the car towed.<eos> What happened?<eos> That's my car!<eos> What happened to my car?<eos> Check the apartment. Call me when it's safe.<eos> Yes, sir. Right away.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Smith, you stick with Mr. grey.

Nothing's gonna happen to me.<eos> Can I wash this off?<eos> Don't stray from the lines.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are these burns?<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Go on, it's over.<eos> I know how difficult it is for you to open up to me and tell me these things.<eos> But it means the world to me.<eos> It means you love me.
But it means the world to me.<eos> It means you love me.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> So this is where your knot-tying expertise comes from.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Sleep well?<eos> I did.<eos> This boat is really beautiful.<eos> This is from my yard in Seattle.<eos> You built it?
Good morning.<eos> Sleep well?<eos> I did.<eos> This boat is really beautiful.<eos> This is from my yard in Seattle.<eos> You built it?<eos> I had some help.<eos> It's called the grace.<eos> After your mom?<eos> You sound surprised.

You sound surprised.<eos> Well, you're always so cool towards her.<eos> I owe everything to grace.<eos> She saved my life after my birth mom died.<eos> Do you remember your birth mom?<eos> I try not to.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> She overdosed.<eos> They found her body three days later.<eos> Where were you?
Grace was there.<eos> Thank you for telling me.<eos> Look at that house.<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> The view's probably amazing.<eos> I wonder who lives there.<eos> It's an old sea widow.<eos> Lost her husband years ago.<eos> Sits at the window every night waiting for him to come home.<eos> Did you just make that up?

Okay,<eos> no, you're fine, Ana.<eos> I'm still here.<eos> Don't let go.<eos> I have to let go.<eos> Don't.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> You ready?
No, yeah, I know.<eos> Yeah, i booked your room.<eos> Of course.<eos> And you.<eos> It's expected that my assistant also attends.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't apologize.<eos> Just get yourself a room.<eos> Unless you'd rather stay back with your boyfriend.

Give me your hand.<eos> It's even more intense when you take them off.<eos> What's this?<eos> Okay.<eos> That's enough show-and-tell.<eos> What's this?<eos> Let's learn to walk before we run.<eos> I kinda like running.<eos> Ana? Mmm-hmm?<eos> Last time we did this, you saw another side of me.

Last time was different.<eos> All right.<eos> But not here.<eos> Mrs. Jones.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> You're mine.<eos> I'm yours.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know at some point we're gonna need to talk about New York.
But not here.<eos> Mrs. Jones.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> You're mine.<eos> I'm yours.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know at some point we're gonna need to talk about New York.<eos> We have talked about it.<eos> You forbidding it is not us talking about it.

Good.<eos> I hate it when we fight.<eos> That wasn't a fight.<eos> That was a conversation.<eos> It was, you know, when somebody talks, and the other person listens, and you resolve an issue.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> It's crazy, isn't it?<eos> Night, Ana.<eos> Good night, Hannah.<eos> You leaving?
You leaving?<eos> Um, I was actually just about to come talk to you.<eos> Uh, about New York.<eos> There a problem?<eos> I'm so grateful for the opportunity, Jack, but with such short notice, i made plans that I can't change. Huh.<eos> But I will have my phone on me all weekend.<eos> So if you need anything, I'm available.<eos> Ana, have a seat.<eos> I'm really... I'm sorry.<eos> I think you have tremendous potential here.
It was just a misunderstanding.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Because there are plenty of qualified people who would kill for this job.<eos> I mean, look, I don't wanna brag, but I'm a pretty great teacher.<eos> I'm sure you are.<eos> I'm just not seeing the initiative on your side of it.<eos> I've read more than you've asked me to.<eos> And I'm on top of everything...<eos> I'm talking about going the extra mile.<eos> Unless you want me to compete with Christian grey for your attention.

Hmm?
Good night.<eos> Well, at least that's dealt with.<eos> Hyde's out. He's been fired.<eos> How?<eos> That's...<eos> But I thought your deal with sip hasn't been finished yet.<eos> It's not.<eos> But I know the ceo.<eos> I told him what happened.<eos> You'll never have to see him again.

Yes.<eos> I want you here all the time.<eos> As soon as possible.<eos> What happened to learning to walk before we run?<eos> That's just one of the many things that we could talk about over breakfast.<eos> Can I think about it?<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Liz, hi!<eos> Ana, don't know if you heard, but Jack resigned last night.
Liz, hi!<eos> Ana, don't know if you heard, but Jack resigned last night.<eos> In kind of a hurry.<eos> Sip isn't recruiting right now, so we're screwed.<eos> So you don't need me anymore then?<eos> I'm gonna try to find you something temporary.<eos> Could you fill in for Jack at this morning's meeting?<eos> At the senior editors' meeting?<eos> Just for today.<eos> You're the only one who knows Jack's entire slate.

Take off your panties.<eos> Do it now.<eos> Right in here?<eos> Yeah, right here.<eos> Go on.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Don't come.<eos> Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. No.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> Are you kidding?

And if I win?<eos> Your choice.<eos> Break.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mmm. Solids.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Side pocket.<eos> Red room, here we come.<eos> Shit.<eos> I hope you're not a sore loser.
So be rough with me.<eos> And Jada needs someone to sign off on the new carusi.<eos> I kept asking Jack to do that.<eos> Yeah, well, Jack was kind of lazy.<eos> Didn't you notice?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I believe he called it "artistic temperament."<eos> Thank you, Hannah.<eos> Yep.<eos> Hey, it's great that you're doing this, but...
Yeah.<eos> I believe he called it "artistic temperament."<eos> Thank you, Hannah.<eos> Yep.<eos> Hey, it's great that you're doing this, but...<eos> It's totally weird, i know.<eos> I know.<eos> I mean, am I expected to call you miss Steele?<eos> I expect you to call me Ana.<eos> And I don't expect you to fetch me coffee unless you're getting some for yourself.
Take it.<eos> I'm just gonna grab some stuff and check the mail.<eos> I should go up with you.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I'll be two seconds.<eos> Take it.<eos> Hey, ros.<eos> Leila.<eos> Christian is downstairs.<eos> Do you wanna see him?
I'll be two seconds.<eos> Take it.<eos> Hey, ros.<eos> Leila.<eos> Christian is downstairs.<eos> Do you wanna see him?<eos> I came to see you.<eos> Okay.<eos> He told me what happened.<eos> I know you're in a lot of pain.
I came to see you.<eos> Okay.<eos> He told me what happened.<eos> I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.<eos> He cares about you.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> Tell me what you have that I don't.
He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.<eos> He cares about you.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> Tell me what you have that I don't.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> How do you know that?
Don't lie.<eos> Tell me what you have that I don't.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.
He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.<eos> I do, too.<eos> We all do.<eos> Why don't you put the gun down?<eos> You don't know him or what he likes.

Taylor, get her out of here.<eos> Miss Steele.<eos> Miss Steele.<eos> Ana!<eos> Stop it, Taylor.<eos> I don't care.<eos> She's been gone for three hours, and she doesn't have her cell or her purse.<eos> Forget it.<eos> She's here.<eos> Where the fuck have you been?
Forget it.<eos> She's here.<eos> Where the fuck have you been?<eos> I told you to come straight here.<eos> I've had people out combing the streets, looking for you.<eos> I'm sorry I don't always do as I'm told.<eos> Maybe you just really need someone who obeys every command.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> I saw you, Christian.<eos> I saw the way you were with Leila.
I would have done anything to subdue her.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> Is she here?<eos> What?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> She's in the psych ward getting the help that she needs.<eos> Look, I know she scared you...<eos> Yeah.<eos> She scared me.<eos> But you scared me more.
I'll never be able to give you that kind of submission and obedience.<eos> Ana.<eos> Don't crowd me.<eos> I need space.<eos> No, please don't do this.<eos> Christian.<eos> Don't give up on me.<eos> I just need to think a little bit.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> What are you doing?
Don't crowd me.<eos> I need space.<eos> No, please don't do this.<eos> Christian.<eos> Don't give up on me.<eos> I just need to think a little bit.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get up.<eos> What are you doing?
I just need to think a little bit.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get up.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I know you say that I'm enough.<eos> But there are certain things that you are used to getting that I will never, ever, ever be able to give you.

I don't even understand your need to dominate.<eos> I'm not a dominant.<eos> I'm not.<eos> The right term is a sadist.<eos> I get off on punishing women.<eos> Women who look like you...<eos> Like your mother.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I know how fucked up that is.<eos> When you left, I swore that I would stop it if that's what it took to get you back.

No!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> No.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Marry me.<eos> What?<eos> I want you to marry me.
Hey.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> No.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Marry me.<eos> What?<eos> I want you to marry me.<eos> Christian, I think you're dreaming.
I want you to marry me.<eos> Christian, I think you're dreaming.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Sleep okay?<eos> I did.<eos> You?<eos> Like a log.<eos> Out all night.<eos> You didn't have any weird dreams or anything?
Don't mess with me like that.<eos> No?<eos> How should i mess with you?<eos> Like this?<eos> Ls that better?<eos> I meant it.<eos> I wanna marry you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I wanna spend every second of the rest of my life with you.<eos> I don't expect you to say yes right away.

What do I get Christian for his birthday?<eos> The boy already has everything except a sense of humor.<eos> His birthday?<eos> When is his birthday?<eos> Sunday.<eos> He didn't tell you?<eos> He is so weird.<eos> Mom and dad are throwing him a party.<eos> Didn't they just have a party?<eos> Jeez, you're as bad as he is.
Do you have a gift box?<eos> One second.<eos> Hey.<eos> Miss Steele.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Looking up, Mr. grey.<eos> Where's Taylor?<eos> He went to get my bag.<eos> Your bag?<eos> Where are you going?
How was your day?<eos> Looking up, Mr. grey.<eos> Where's Taylor?<eos> He went to get my bag.<eos> Your bag?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Ros and I have to go to Portland for some meetings.<eos> I'll be back tomorrow night.<eos> Come on.<eos> When were you going to tell me about your birthday?
Birthday.<eos> My, uh, arrival in the world isn't something I feel like celebrating.<eos> Well, I feel like celebrating it.<eos> Can't open it till the day though.<eos> Then why give it to me now?<eos> Call it delayed gratification.<eos> Ls that... Ls that mount St. helens?<eos> I changed the flight plan, get us home sooner.<eos> Great.<eos> You realize that's a volcano, right?

Oh, my god, Christian!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Christian!<eos> There.<eos> There, there, there, there!<eos> Oh, you remember this guy?<eos> Anastasiai Kate!<eos> Hi!<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> You're so tan and glowy.
Stop it!<eos> Christian!<eos> There.<eos> There, there, there, there!<eos> Oh, you remember this guy?<eos> Anastasiai Kate!<eos> Hi!<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> You're so tan and glowy.<eos> You want a beer, Ana?
Uh, Christian is good.<eos> He asked me to move in with him.<eos> What?<eos> Ana's moving in with Christian.<eos> Oh, that's great.<eos> You know, we could use the privacy.<eos> He's so subtle, it kills me.<eos> Stop.<eos> So you're serious.<eos> But are you happy?
And Christian grey, although only 27 years old, had extensive flying experience.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> One of Seattle's youngest billionaires, grey's the charismatic head of grey enterprises holdings, a multinational conglomerate...<eos> Jesus!<eos> Will someone shut them up?<eos> No, please.<eos> Leave it on.<eos> Just turn it down please, José.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're shivering.
You're shivering.<eos> I'll get you a sweater, okay?<eos> Ana.<eos> Tea.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> He has to be okay.<eos> We haven't had any time.<eos> We need to have more time.<eos> You're going to have plenty of time.<eos> We're so glad that you're here with us and in Christian's life.

I know, but children grow apart from their parents, and that's fine, as long as they're happy.<eos> And he is happy with you.<eos> And that's all i ever wanted.<eos> Turn it up.<eos> Newsreader". Christian grey and his colleague ros Bailey have been found safe and well and are, at this moment, on their way back to Seattle.<eos> What the hell are you all doing here?<eos> Christian?<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Christian!<eos> How did you get here?

Welcome home, Mr. grey.<eos> Christian, please.<eos> Well, it's late, and these two should get some rest.<eos> Grace, shall we?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I think we're gonna head home too, bro.<eos> Cool.<eos> We'll walk you guys.<eos> Kinda hate to say this, but your guy's all right.<eos> I'm glad he's okay, and I'm glad you're happy.
It's after midnight.<eos> I'm not tired.<eos> No.<eos> It's your birthday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you still have that gift I gave you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know you didn't have to.
Yes.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Wait!<eos> So this whole time I had the answer in my pocket?<eos> Anastasia Steele...<eos> What am I gonna do with you?<eos> Take me to the red room.<eos> Take me...<eos> Take me to the red room.<eos> Are you sure?
Take me to the red room.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, I love you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Mom? Hi.<eos> Ana, sweetheart.<eos> Where have you been?
Ana, sweetheart.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I know. I've been...<eos> I'm sorry. Work has been so crazy.<eos> I hope they're not overworking you?<eos> No, no.<eos> It's actually... It's going really well.<eos> Um, but I was calling because I, um... i wanted to talk to you about Christian.<eos> Christian?<eos> You've heard from him?
No, no.<eos> It's actually... It's going really well.<eos> Um, but I was calling because I, um... i wanted to talk to you about Christian.<eos> Christian?<eos> You've heard from him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We got back together.<eos> Honey, that's wonderful!<eos> This time it's going to last. I know it is.<eos> I hope you're right, because, um...
Christian?<eos> You've heard from him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We got back together.<eos> Honey, that's wonderful!<eos> This time it's going to last. I know it is.<eos> I hope you're right, because, um...<eos> He asked me to marry him, and I said yes.<eos> Mom?<eos> You're not...
You're not...<eos> No, no, I'm not pregnant.<eos> I know that we haven't been together very long,<eos> but I love him so much.<eos> He's the one.<eos> Oh, sweetheart!<eos> I'm so happy for you!<eos> You are?<eos> Of course.<eos> You've always known your own mind.
but I love him so much.<eos> He's the one.<eos> Oh, sweetheart!<eos> I'm so happy for you!<eos> You are?<eos> Of course.<eos> You've always known your own mind.<eos> If that man is the love of your life, you grab him with both hands.<eos> Thanks, mama.<eos> Have you called ray?
Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Christian.<eos> Mom.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And Ana.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's so good to see you again.<eos> You saw us last night.
Thank you.<eos> And Ana.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's so good to see you again.<eos> You saw us last night.<eos> Yes.<eos> And because of that I am never taking anything for granted. Ever again.<eos> Hey!<eos> I heard about the crash.<eos> Are you okay?
I'm sorry i didn't tell you.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Come here.<eos> So, how does it feel to bag Seattle's most eligible bachelor?<eos> It's a little scary, but...<eos> Well, if anyone can make it work, it's you.<eos> Hey, sis-in-law!<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Christian's a very lucky guy.<eos> You, however, are certifiably insane.

I'm done.<eos> The business.<eos> Everything.<eos> I'll have my people sort out the details tomorrow.<eos> I know she was important to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> What's that you got there?
No.<eos> No.<eos> What's that you got there?<eos> Come with me.<eos> There's something I need to show you.<eos> Last time we came down here, i was over your shoulder.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> After you.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> You wanted hearts and flowers.
Hey. Hey, easy.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Hey. Easy.<eos> -Yeah!<eos> -I'm all right!<eos> Told you. We're not big enough.<eos> Hang on.<eos> - We did it.<eos> - Yeah, 46th time's the charm.<eos> Can't you just enjoy it for once?
Uh, c-c-cool way's good, right, Ajar?<eos> -Don't come any closer.<eos> -Or what?<eos> Don't answer that. It's a trick question.<eos> Baby skin, baby sting.<eos> Oh, not again.<eos> I hate when this happens.<eos> You guys really suit each other.<eos> The big, bad bedwetters.<eos> If you want this watermelon, it'll be over my dead body.
I'm not little!<eos> And we're not cute!<eos> -Could have been worse.<eos> -Oh, yeah?<eos> How?<eos> They didn't beat us up this time.<eos> I can't stand this anymore.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Where are you gonna go?
And we're not cute!<eos> -Could have been worse.<eos> -Oh, yeah?<eos> How?<eos> They didn't beat us up this time.<eos> I can't stand this anymore.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Where are you gonna go?<eos> You're kidding, right?
-Well, thank you, Chief Chief.<eos> -No big deal.<eos> This pretty green in the sand, I can spot it from miles away.<eos> Hey, don't you have an oasis to watch?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'll leave you with your family.<eos> And sorry for the inconvenience.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?<eos> It's dangerous over there.<eos> What do you expect to find anyway?

It's dangerous over there.<eos> What do you expect to find anyway?<eos> What are you gonna do if you come across a Dustie, huh?<eos> -Oh, yeah, yeah, go ahead, play deaf. -Yeah, yeah.<eos> Do you know what those ugly snakes are like? Beggars, thieves, liars!<eos> They don't even wash, for Pete's sake!<eos> No water. Hello?<eos> I'm pretty sure they eat their own poop and marry their children.<eos> -Or maybe it's the other way around.<eos> -Are you actually saying that?

-Security, a future.<eos> -What future?<eos> Sit around a stone all day playing dead like you?<eos> Okay, that's enough, young lady.<eos> We're having the Spencers over for dinner.<eos> You know, the ones with the big south-facing stone.<eos> I can't even imagine what they paid for it.<eos> Anyway, they're coming with their son John-John.<eos> -A really nice chap.<eos> -What do you think? That you can sell me like it's the Middle Ages?

I feel sick!<eos> I'm suffocating here!<eos> Oh, my God, you're crying.<eos> What happened? Did you mess up your makeup?<eos> No touchy.<eos> Ah, teenagers.<eos> So annoying, right?<eos> -Okay.<eos> See you later, guys.<eos> -Oh, uh, you're going out again?
The guys are waiting for me.<eos> -And, uh, what are you gonna do?<eos> Hm.<eos> nothing.<eos> Gary, won't you at least take off the wig?<eos> I mean, really, it's been a--<eos> Yeah, yeah. Love you, too, Dad.<eos> See ya.<eos> How did we end up with those kids?<eos> Would you be a sweetheart and go get me a nice pillow?
Not at all.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> All right, so you're gonna go slither a little more over that way, please.<eos> Thank you, officer.<eos> Come on.<eos> Dusties! Alert!<eos> We're gonna die! We're gonna die!<eos> We're gonna die!<eos> Stop running around.<eos> You're gonna get us noticed.
Pitt!<eos> Pitt, you there?<eos> Pitt?<eos> Please don't say anything.<eos> You--You're a Dustie?<eos> Really?<eos> I mean, yeah, of course, I am.<eos> But I've never seen you--<eos> I mean, of course I haven't, obviously, because I live here.<eos> I've never been over there, where you live.

-How did you know?<eos> -I don't.<eos> I gotta get out of here.<eos> They're gonna kill me!<eos> Out?<eos> Which way?<eos> I don't even know--<eos> I mean, sure, I know, but I...<eos> Watch out!<eos> Next time, watch where you're going, you big lump!
Ajar? Ajar?<eos> Step aside, sir.<eos> Don't worry, everything's under control.<eos> -I'm Eva.<eos> -I, uh...<eos> Ajar.<eos> Okay, Ajar.<eos> Follow me!<eos> Ooh. Ouch!<eos> You can't swim?
Don't worry, everything's under control.<eos> -I'm Eva.<eos> -I, uh...<eos> Ajar.<eos> Okay, Ajar.<eos> Follow me!<eos> Ooh. Ouch!<eos> You can't swim?<eos> How come you can't swim?<eos> How come you can swim?
Ajar.<eos> Okay, Ajar.<eos> Follow me!<eos> Ooh. Ouch!<eos> You can't swim?<eos> How come you can't swim?<eos> How come you can swim?<eos> Ajar!<eos> Look out!<eos> What were you doing in the oasis?
Follow me!<eos> Ooh. Ouch!<eos> You can't swim?<eos> How come you can't swim?<eos> How come you can swim?<eos> Ajar!<eos> Look out!<eos> What were you doing in the oasis?<eos> You're a Dustie.<eos> That's why you can't swim.
Ooh. Ouch!<eos> You can't swim?<eos> How come you can't swim?<eos> How come you can swim?<eos> Ajar!<eos> Look out!<eos> What were you doing in the oasis?<eos> You're a Dustie.<eos> That's why you can't swim.<eos> Did you wanna steal something or kill someone?
Did you wanna steal something or kill someone?<eos> -You're not gonna kill me, right?<eos> -Hey, stop.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> I just...<eos> I just wanted to come and live here.<eos> The oasis?<eos> It's like the worst place ever.<eos> It's ridiculously small, you just keep seeing the same boring people who are only worried about protecting their things.
I mean, unless we're--<eos> -So, who's the girl?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> No trace of them, Chief Chief.<eos> They probably drowned.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go back to the station.<eos> I'll take a last look around.<eos> They lost us.<eos> -Are you coming?
Nice to meet you.<eos> No trace of them, Chief Chief.<eos> They probably drowned.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go back to the station.<eos> I'll take a last look around.<eos> They lost us.<eos> -Are you coming?<eos> You-<eos> - You want me to come with you?

Let us go or I'll kill him.<eos> -Oh, yeah. That makes more sense.<eos> -Don't try anything.<eos> -Sergeant, don't move.<eos> -There. Yeah, you see? Listen to him.<eos> Hey, you're not really my style, bro.<eos> Pitt, get on his back.<eos> Now if you follow us, he's dead meat.<eos> You got that?<eos> You do what you're told or he's dead.
Whoa, you sure showed them.<eos> Hey, just drop me off over there by the palm tree.<eos> No way.<eos> We gotta save Eva.<eos> -Huh?<eos> -I beg your pardon?<eos> Eva?<eos> Like, my sister? What?<eos> We're her only hope.<eos> You don't even know her!
Like, my sister? What?<eos> We're her only hope.<eos> You don't even know her!<eos> If you guys are, like, talking about my sister, let it go, seriously.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> She's this guy's sister!<eos> There, another palm tree, that'll be fine.<eos> Ajar, we never do anything right.<eos> She'd probably have a better chance without us.<eos> I hate doing this, but do you have any idea who my father is?

And bend and snap, and bend and snap.<eos> And suck it in, big girl.<eos> -Hey, the new girl's up.<eos> Welcome!<eos> We're so happy to meet you.<eos> -I'm Lily Belle.<eos> -I'm Lulu Belle.<eos> -We're twin sisters. -We're twin sisters. -We're both Geminis.<eos> Hmm, you've got potential, girl.<eos> I feel like you're a bit on the chubby side.

-Oh, so it's "Miss Rita's ballet company".<eos> -Precisely.<eos> Who made dancers out of you?<eos> Who taught you everything? Him?<eos> Him is the He-who-must-not-be-named.<eos> -Yeah, you can't say "Omar" or--<eos> -You just said it.<eos> -What did just I say?<eos> -You said what we're not supposed to say.<eos> - You said, "Omar."

-George.<eos> The George.<eos> Me.<eos> Is this your first tour?<eos> Don't answer.<eos> It's obvious.<eos> So fresh, so pure.<eos> She's adorable.<eos> I see great things for you, for us.<eos> Do you...
feel it?<eos> That chemistry between us?<eos> Oh, what is happening to us?<eos> A wild one.<eos> I love it.<eos> Oh, chill out, I was just kidding.<eos> Girls, really.<eos> Don't worry, you're not that fat.<eos> Check this out.<eos> When you get hungry, you do this and poof!
Flat.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> This is a once in a lifetime experience.<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.<eos> Wow, funny skin.<eos> - It's a Dustie skin. - Oh, yeah?<eos> -It looks more like you haven't-- -There!<eos> That way!<eos> Pitt!<eos> -What do you think you're doing?
Okay, definitely not super brave.<eos> Super crazy.<eos> -You almost got us killed!<eos> -I said I was sorry!<eos> How are we ever gonna find Eva now?<eos> Dude, let it go already.<eos> - The girl's off limits anyway.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> -Why'd she kiss me? -I don't know.<eos> You were the exotic tourist.
And who does Robin?<eos> I'm Gary.<eos> So you guys are, like, buddies?<eos> That's weird. A snake and a scorpion?<eos> I mean, I say that but nothing ever really shocks me.<eos> My friend Peter once dated a frog, so...<eos> Does he ever shut up?<eos> ...the desert is super dangerous?<eos> They even blow things up out there, just for the fun of it.<eos> You should save some saliva, you know?
Hey, Leftie, you all right in there?<eos> Hey!<eos> Gary, where are you?<eos> - Say something!<eos> - Here!<eos> Gary?<eos> Gary, where are you?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> How are you ever gonna get me out of here now?<eos> Why didn't you warn us?
Snakes.<eos> Lords of the desert for millennia, sons of the sun.<eos> Beautiful for some, terrifying for others.<eos> But there lies a power that masters their souls.<eos> Carved in the vertebra of a Seba python, by a voodoo master from Benin -thousands of years ago. -Uh-uh.<eos> Dad!<eos> The flute of Kpassenou.<eos> You, stop!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Do you want to end up as a belt?
-Yours is.<eos> - Oh, my goodness. - That was terrible.<eos> Dance is not just undulating around.<eos> Everyone, lights out!<eos> And you, watch it!<eos> What just happened there?<eos> It was-<eos> - It was stronger than me.<eos> That music, I couldn't fight it.<eos> And you even loved it, didn't you?
Can you believe that?<eos> Thanks, Mr. "Left, left, ooh, a hole."<eos> Well, at least I wasn't following a goat.<eos> Just sit back and watch.<eos> People, lights!<eos> Let's start with this long string of stars.<eos> This is our galaxy. The Milky Way.<eos> There, you can spot the W of Cassiopeia, and right there on the side is the upside down house of Cepheus.<eos> The constellation is very visible...<eos> Hey, you know where we can score some pollen around here?
Well, we all die someday.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> They did it!<eos> They actually did it!<eos> They blew up their bomb!<eos> A curse on both your houses!<eos> Psst.<eos> Hey!<eos> Shh! Shut up!<eos> - Honey, what are you doing?
- I'm just enjoying the view.<eos> - Huh? -Uh, he's not really gonna--? -He is.<eos> Oh, that was gorgeous.<eos> That was... ew!<eos> You wanna see more of that?<eos> Are you into this somehow?<eos> Come on, honey, there's fresh water in the car.<eos> - Ho ho, say "cheese."<eos> - Oh, no, please, I look awful.<eos> You look great.
He's tough.<eos> He'll just put everyone to sleep with that little stingy thing he does so well.<eos> -This is all your fault!<eos> -True that.<eos> Since the beginning, you've been nothing but a giant pain in the tail!<eos> It's true.<eos> I wasn't very helpful.<eos> And now my best-- my only friend is getting crushed.<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> Can you stop that agreeing thing you've got going on?
Yes, my dear.<eos> Dance is a demanding art form.<eos> -What about you?<eos> -Me?<eos> -It's my 11th year of success.<eos> -Eleven?<eos> This can't be.<eos> Oh, these kids.<eos> They think everything should be handed to them on a silver platter.<eos> -I understand, you know.
-Eleven?<eos> This can't be.<eos> Oh, these kids.<eos> They think everything should be handed to them on a silver platter.<eos> -I understand, you know.<eos> -Please, I need to be alone right now.<eos> Try to overlook my very good looks, my irresistible charm.<eos> I'm not just a swift-tailed string of muscles.<eos> I'm a snake like you. with a heart like yours.<eos> Can you hear it?

It knows what you feel.<eos> The uprooting, the solitude, the confinement.<eos> That's the price we pay for the life we chose.<eos> -I didn't choose this.<eos> -Even better. It chose you.<eos> Destiny brought us together.<eos> It's fate.<eos> No one is going to come rescue you, sweetie.<eos> And all around us, it's pretty much just sand and death.<eos> But, if you still want to escape, I know a way.
No one is going to come rescue you, sweetie.<eos> And all around us, it's pretty much just sand and death.<eos> But, if you still want to escape, I know a way.<eos> You really want me out of here, don't you?<eos> Sooner or later, Omar is going to make us dance against each other.<eos> I'd just rather skip that part.<eos> All you have to do is drop onto the sand without a sound.<eos> It's daytime. He has no reason to be playing his flute.<eos> No one's going to see you.<eos> You just go and you're free.

- Thank you for- - Oh.<eos> - Go.<eos> Just what do you think you're doing?<eos> It ain't strolling time, miss.<eos> Well, actually, there's been a mistake.<eos> See, I shouldn't be here.<eos> Hey, Jerry. "I shouldn't be here."<eos> They're all the same!<eos> Back inside.<eos> - Oh, will you just go away?
We got a wild one!<eos> Escape alert!<eos> She's getting away!<eos> What is this?<eos> Snakes who'll end up as belts or designer shoes.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's horrible.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> I should've let you finish me off, now that I think about it.<eos> Plus you'd feel really bad right now.

Where is it?<eos> -Nah. Never heard of it.<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> Come back!<eos> Well, at least we're slithering in the right direction.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> So where's Souksoukville?<eos> Oh, you're such a "the glass is half-empty" kind of guy.<eos> So scorpion.<eos> You've hung out with that doofus for too long.

Maybe we should take a break, honey.<eos> It looks really fine right here.<eos> Something moved!<eos> The shoe, it moved.<eos> It could be a mongoose or a gerbil.<eos> Everyone, get behind me.<eos> Hey, you in there!<eos> Get out of there!<eos> See?<eos> You overreacted again, honey.
You keep making a fool of yourself.<eos> Good evening, sir.<eos> Would you mind if we rested in your humble home for the night?<eos> Uh, I...<eos> I can't feel my tail.<eos> This is the end.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> Well, maybe I do.<eos> Bury yourself in the sand, that'll make you feel warm.<eos> -What are you thinking about?
Uh, I...<eos> I can't feel my tail.<eos> This is the end.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> Well, maybe I do.<eos> Bury yourself in the sand, that'll make you feel warm.<eos> -What are you thinking about?<eos> And Eva.<eos> We may never see 'em again.<eos> Well, you can thank life for that.

-Oh.<eos> -Barbecue?<eos> Keychain?<eos> -We never knew.<eos> He got away, God knows how, and he ended up in the suburbs with us.<eos> Two losers among losers.<eos> We hit it off right away.<eos> Yeah, kinda like us.<eos> I mean, except I'm not a loser, of course.<eos> You think Eva...?
Oh, precious.<eos> And then, I ran into Gary, and using just my claws,<eos> I freed him from the atrocious mucus while Ajar was just--<eos> What?<eos> You are so brave.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I...<eos> Why don't you come with us, sweetie?<eos> Oh, that's really nice of you, but Ajar...<eos> You're a scorpion.
Come inside!<eos> Okay, we've gotta find the man who kidnapped Eva.<eos> -Uh, Omar?<eos> -I don't know his name.<eos> Tall, skinny, scary-faced?<eos> -His shop is that way.<eos> That's him.<eos> Let's use the rooftops. It's safer.<eos> What?<eos> -What are you doing?
Let's use the rooftops. It's safer.<eos> What?<eos> -What are you doing?<eos> -Nothing.<eos> Look, Eva.<eos> Shh. Let me speak.<eos> I understand why you and I will never be a thing.<eos> It's no problem.<eos> We are all looking for different things in life.<eos> You'll see, you'll get used to it.
I understand why you and I will never be a thing.<eos> It's no problem.<eos> We are all looking for different things in life.<eos> You'll see, you'll get used to it.<eos> It's not that bad a life.<eos> It's just...<eos> It's not what I imagined my life would be like.<eos> It never is.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Hey, where are you going?

You're right.<eos> It's not like we crossed a whole desert and almost died, like, 26 times in horrifying ways to get here.<eos> So?<eos> Are you coming or not?<eos> Have you seen this guy?<eos> You don't stand a chance with a guy like that.<eos> So out of your league, bro.<eos> -Are you done?<eos> -Well, that depends.<eos> Are you just gonna stand there and whine or are you gonna save my sister?

-Your brother's name is Ajar?<eos> -He's her boyfriend?<eos> -That's so romantic.<eos> -Yeah. -Yeah.<eos> She's dating her brother?<eos> Wait.<eos> Just hold it there.<eos> I can't hold on anymore.<eos> Who's there?<eos> What have you done?
-He's her boyfriend?<eos> -That's so romantic.<eos> -Yeah. -Yeah.<eos> She's dating her brother?<eos> Wait.<eos> Just hold it there.<eos> I can't hold on anymore.<eos> Who's there?<eos> What have you done?<eos> -Ajar, you came.
Just hold it there.<eos> I can't hold on anymore.<eos> Who's there?<eos> What have you done?<eos> -Ajar, you came.<eos> -Let's go!<eos> Trying to escape, my cuties?<eos> Do you really think you can get away from me?<eos> You stupid worm.<eos> You think your venom can hurt me?
That's gonna be high maintenance.<eos> You- - You crossed the desert for me?<eos> I would have crossed a thousand.<eos> -So, who's the man?<eos> -Pitt!<eos> Oh, buddy, I missed you so much.<eos> Wow.<eos> -Is this new?<eos> -Long story.<eos> You remember Eva?
Yeah. Um...<eos> Ajar, this is Emily.<eos> Emily, this is--<eos> Oh, Pitt told me so much about you.<eos> I mean, the glow worms, the snake killer birds, the attack of the mongooses, the ride on the back of the oryx, the man-eating lions.<eos> I know about everything.<eos> And knowing Pitt like I do, I'm sure he was really modest about it.<eos> Here we go!<eos> Welcome, my friends, to our discovery tour of the Sahara.<eos> By the way, do you dance?

Ballet, tutus, all that kind of stuff.
Gonna go right round, OK.<eos> All right. Well done. We're nearly done.<eos> OK, just under the tongue.<eos> All done.<eos> You're doing really well.<eos> OK, now. Second request, also comfort-related.<eos> Do you think you could do a quick erm... urine sample for me?<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi, Dad, it's only me.<eos> Oh, er... are you on your way home?
- Hello.<eos> - Hi, Dad, it's only me.<eos> Oh, er... are you on your way home?<eos> Er... not yet.<eos> Something's come up.<eos> - Doesn't it always? - Yep.<eos> So, look, I... I don't know when I'll be back.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Have you got Fred to bed OK?<eos> Could you er... pick up a loaf on your way home?
Hello?<eos> Yep, this is Mrs. Miller.<eos> Why?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> He's so sorry.<eos> - Aren't you, so sorry?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where did you get this?
Well done.<eos> I'm mortified and disgusted at his behaviour.<eos> - It will not happen again.<eos> - I'm sure we all understand how tough it has been for you as a family...<eos> No, no, no, don't say that.<eos> It isn't about that.<eos> It isn't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> You're 15!

- New case.<eos> - Can you talk about it?<eos> - No. Sorry.<eos> - How's the homework?<eos> - All done.<eos> I'm gonna hang out in town with the guys for a bit, maybe go round one of their houses.<eos> - "The guys"? Which guys?<eos> - Over there.<eos> I'll be back by ten.<eos> You'll still be at work, anyway.
- Dad, what's going on?<eos> - Just be careful, OK?<eos> Don't mention this to your mates.<eos> - Well, thanks for freaking me out.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> See you later.<eos> Yeah, what's up, Cath?<eos> Trish was raped at our party on Saturday night.<eos> What?<eos> But how do you know?
Had my appraisal today.<eos> Seemed to go all right.<eos> And I got a new client.<eos> Haven't seen her yet.<eos> - She doesn't live too far so...<eos> - Well, that's not good.<eos> A woman nearby got attacked?<eos> You know I'm not supposed to talk about it.<eos> If a woman round here has been attacked, I don't want either of you anywhere alone after dark.<eos> We don't need you looking after us.
Hey!<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's move!<eos> No!<eos> - Let me see. - No!<eos> Come on.<eos> I made you a special breakfast.<eos> You can't cook.
Hey!<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's move!<eos> No!<eos> - Let me see. - No!<eos> Come on.<eos> I made you a special breakfast.<eos> You can't cook.<eos> Hey, Mary, open up!<eos> You look beautiful.

You fix the boats on a dock.

You're gonna be great.<eos> You know, just...<eos> I don't know. Try being' a kid.<eos> Frank!<eos> Frank, I know you hear me.<eos> Frank!<eos> There's still time for you to undo this nonsense.<eos> Go get in your car and go get that child.<eos> Are you technically allowed to use those keys whenever you want?<eos> How can you stand there... acting all calm and everything, Frank, and make light of this?
Are you technically allowed to use those keys whenever you want?<eos> How can you stand there... acting all calm and everything, Frank, and make light of this?<eos> Now go get her back before it's too late.<eos> She gotta get out in the world. She has no friends her age. No social skills.<eos> She doesn't know how to be a kid.<eos> Two nights ago, she told me that even if Germany balls out the euro... there could still be a worldwide depression.<eos> I was staring at the ceiling for three hours.<eos> I'm so worried.<eos> Come on, Roberta.<eos> If you start crying, I'm gonna have to pretend to start crying.

She's the boss?<eos> Mrs. Davis is our principal. Mm-kay...<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I want you to get on your phone and call Frank... and tell him to get me out of here!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That's the dad?<eos> I know him.<eos> I see him at Ferg's almost every Friday night.<eos> He's the quiet, damaged hot guy.<eos> What are you doing at Ferg's every Friday night?
- Okay.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Bonnie.<eos> Frank.<eos> For the record, I didn't wanna go to the stupid school in the first place.<eos> And the boy in the next row acts inappropriately for someone who's a child.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm still passive aggressively ignoring you.<eos> Other kids answer questions. They don't get into trouble.<eos> You didn't get in trouble for answering questions.<eos> You yelled at the principal.
So, I googled "first graders who yell at the principal..."<eos> and statistically, you're never gonna believe how many kids do it.<eos> How many?<eos> None.<eos> Frank, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> You can't show off like that at school.<eos> I know.<eos> You promised you wouldn't, then the first day...
I screwed up.<eos> Do you think maybe this boat needs a test ride?<eos> Go get Fred.<eos> Don't run.<eos> Fred loves to watch the sandpipers.<eos> He thinks he'd like to catch one... but he'd regret it.<eos> Fred's not a killer.<eos> He's a lover.<eos> Would my mom have wanted me to go to this school?<eos> I can only guess. But I'll tell you what, she would have wanted you to have friends.

I left my pen with you.<eos> Pass those around, guys.<eos> Okay? I wanna see your work.<eos> Turn around, face the desk.<eos> Think about how you get to the answer.<eos> It's not just about, you know, guessing.<eos> Don't be messy.<eos> Done.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Okay. I thought you might finish quickly, so a little something extra.
Very British.<eos> Do you mean, British in demeanor or...<eos> - No.<eos> Like she's... - She's from England.<eos> From England.<eos> So, Mary is a genius?<eos> Look out. Look out.<eos> Your little animals are escaping, dumbass.<eos> Hey!<eos> You should not be laughing!

This is a mistake.<eos> Well, just dumb her down into a decent human being.<eos> Everybody wins.<eos> You know what?<eos> Can you excuse me one minute?<eos> Bring me every piece of paperwork we have on this girl.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you sure you know what you're doing?<eos> No.<eos> Okay. Mary, I think you have something you'd like to say to the class.
I'm seven.<eos> That would be your grandmother.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> An Apple?<eos> It's a MacBook, darling.<eos> Top of the line with the Retina Display.<eos> Hey, you know who else has a Retina Display?<eos> Fred!<eos> Mary, I understand you like mathematics.<eos> So, on there, you'll find a great out-of-print book by Charles Zimmer called Transitions in Advanced Algebra.

Love that book.<eos> You're saying you've read it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've kind of moved on to differential equations now.<eos> Don't forget your manners.<eos> Thank your grandma.<eos> Thank you, Grandma.<eos> Grandmother or Evelyn will do just fine.<eos> There's so much more on there.<eos> Things I know you'll find really challenging. Yes.
Grandmother or Evelyn will do just fine.<eos> There's so much more on there.<eos> Things I know you'll find really challenging. Yes.<eos> But sadly, it's a school night and there's homework to do.<eos> What a surprise though, right?<eos> Say good night to Grandmother or Evelyn.<eos> Good night.<eos> I'd kill a priest for a Benadryl.<eos> Still with the allergies?<eos> Why in God's name have you got a cat?

It's Mary's cat.<eos> I'm just along for the ride.<eos> So let me guess.<eos> Our lovely principal, Ms. Davis.<eos> Never get on the bad side of small-minded people who have a little authority.<eos> I thought I taught you that.<eos> What are you doin' here?
I'm thrilled your seven-year exhaustive search has finally come to a fruitful conclusion.<eos> I don't think this is an appropriate time to talk.<eos> Certainly not the setting.<eos> While I was waiting, a cockroach this big tried to steal my shoe.<eos> Yeah. They'll take a shoe.<eos> Honestly, this?<eos> This godforsaken mosquito ranch was a conscious choice?<eos> I could drop you back off at the airport.<eos> This thing is loaded with cool problems.<eos> So, are you teaching?
I repair boats.<eos> - Please.<eos> - I'm not bad at it either.<eos> Well, then, that explains this.<eos> They don't sell sunscreen here?<eos> I wear sunscreen.<eos> Not enough.<eos> And you need a hat.<eos> A big hat that shades your face and neck.<eos> You're playing Russian roulette with your skin.
You're playing Russian roulette with your skin.<eos> You look like a porn producer.<eos> Okay.<eos> I appreciate the advice.<eos> I do.<eos> But we're not here to talk about sunscreen, are we?<eos> Oh, so no more small talk?<eos> That's a shame.<eos> Okay.<eos> The environment you have created for that child where she lives, the school she attends, it's substandard, every bit of it.
Okay.<eos> The environment you have created for that child where she lives, the school she attends, it's substandard, every bit of it.<eos> I disagree.<eos> We're getting nowhere if we're not gonna be honest with each other.<eos> I am being honest.<eos> I see. Fine.<eos> Well, I'm not leaving without her.<eos> Well, welcome to Florida.<eos> Frank, please listen to reason.<eos> At some point, either you're gonna come to the conclusion, or someone in authority is going to spell it out for you that the child's best interest is all that matters.

Arguably one of the brightest minds on the planet.<eos> Good luck going down that road.<eos> And what do you think she'd say if she saw how her child is living now?<eos> Do you honestly think she'd be pleased?<eos> That she's living a somewhat normal life?<eos> Yes. I do.<eos> She's not normal.<eos> And treating her as such... is negligence on a grand scale.<eos> I know your heart's in the right place on this.<eos> But you are denying the girl her potential. You are.

You are.<eos> I can provide for her, I can enrich her life.<eos> Oh, come on, Evelyn.<eos> You're gonna take that girl, you're gonna bury her in tutors... then you're gonna loan her out to some think tank... where she can talk non-trivial zeros... with a bunch of old Russian guys for the rest of her life.

That's why I have Mary in the first place.<eos> That's uncalled for.<eos> Your sister had a laundry list of problems.<eos> She could have solved Navier-Stokes and gone down in history... as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.<eos> But she didn't because she couldn't finish.<eos> She was weak.<eos> Weak like her father and weak like...<eos> Well...<eos> Now, if it's who I think it is... Kinda puts a black cloud over our luncheon.<eos> You're still stubborn and vindictive.
I could be wrong.<eos> So why would I screw up yours?<eos> Use your head.<eos> But don't be afraid to believe in things either.<eos> There was a guy on TV who said there was no God.<eos> The only difference between the atheists on TV and Roberta... is that Roberta loves you.<eos> She's trying to help.<eos> Tell you what though.<eos> One way or another, we all end up back together in the end.<eos> That's what you're asking, right?
So ordered.<eos> Ms. Dibbons, you'll go over there and check out the living conditions?<eos> On the books, Your Honor.<eos> All right, folks.<eos> Drive carefully.<eos> Her lawyer has a nice suit.<eos> Relax, Frank.<eos> More weight's put on the talent competition.<eos> Go have a cocktail, hmm?<eos> Roberta, would you like to have Mary tonight?

Why wouldn't I like to have Mary tonight?<eos> I told you something like this would happen.<eos> Now look where we are.<eos> And I'm supposed to believe you know what you're doing.<eos> You couldn't even find a white lawyer.<eos> Wow.<eos> Look, just...<eos> - Don't worry, okay?<eos> - Don't tell me that.<eos> There's nothing you can say that's gonna make me feel good... because I have no say in any of this, Frank.
I'll take you home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry, just...<eos> One more time.<eos> I can't find my DVD.<eos> It's right there, baby.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You come and find it.<eos> I'm doing lady business.<eos> Now, you were the last person to watch it.
Yeah.<eos> Sorry, just...<eos> One more time.<eos> I can't find my DVD.<eos> It's right there, baby.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You come and find it.<eos> I'm doing lady business.<eos> Now, you were the last person to watch it.<eos> What did you do with it?
- No!<eos> Are you allowed to... Hey!<eos> Stop!<eos> Enough with the Legos.<eos> Are you allowed to use Roberta's keys?<eos> - No.<eos> - No!<eos> Hey!<eos> Look at me.<eos> Then why are you here, huh?
Are you allowed to... Hey!<eos> Stop!<eos> Enough with the Legos.<eos> Are you allowed to use Roberta's keys?<eos> - No.<eos> - No!<eos> Hey!<eos> Look at me.<eos> Then why are you here, huh?<eos> Can you answer me that?
Stop!<eos> Enough with the Legos.<eos> Are you allowed to use Roberta's keys?<eos> - No.<eos> - No!<eos> Hey!<eos> Look at me.<eos> Then why are you here, huh?<eos> Can you answer me that?<eos> You broke every rule!
Enough with the Legos.<eos> Are you allowed to use Roberta's keys?<eos> - No.<eos> - No!<eos> Hey!<eos> Look at me.<eos> Then why are you here, huh?<eos> Can you answer me that?<eos> You broke every rule!<eos> You just embarrassed me.
And the manufacturers oi Legos, they should all be in prison.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do you forgive me?<eos> Sure. Whatever.<eos> Hey, close the laptop.<eos> Come on.<eos> Please.<eos> Doesn't count if it's not eye to eye.<eos> Come on, please.<eos> Do you really have no life because of me?
Do you forgive me?<eos> Sure. Whatever.<eos> Hey, close the laptop.<eos> Come on.<eos> Please.<eos> Doesn't count if it's not eye to eye.<eos> Come on, please.<eos> Do you really have no life because of me?<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> Did you mean it?
Sure. Whatever.<eos> Hey, close the laptop.<eos> Come on.<eos> Please.<eos> Doesn't count if it's not eye to eye.<eos> Come on, please.<eos> Do you really have no life because of me?<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> Did you mean it?<eos> Last month you said I was the worst uncle in the world... and you wished death upon me 'cause I didn't buy you a piano.

Let's forget it, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Frank?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Can I have a piano?<eos> No.<eos> Was that really Mary's teacher this morning?<eos> You know, I got a book called Fundamentals of Decision Making.<eos> You can borrow it.
No.<eos> Was that really Mary's teacher this morning?<eos> You know, I got a book called Fundamentals of Decision Making.<eos> You can borrow it.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Looks like Mary gets to go to Boston for a couple days.<eos> It's just two days.<eos> Relax.<eos> So, what do you think?
Relax.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> Cool.<eos> Wow!<eos> You and my mom... were always together.<eos> Always.<eos> Oh, no, you don't want to look at that one.<eos> Is that you?<eos> Yes.<eos> How old were you?
Where is this?<eos> That's Cambridge University.<eos> In England.<eos> Who are those people?<eos> My research colleagues.<eos> For what?<eos> Mathematics, of course.<eos> Really?<eos> Cool!<eos> So, then you came to work... at a college in America?
You've got a big day tomorrow.<eos> Come on.<eos> Up, up, up.<eos> Can I play the piano?<eos> No, you can't.<eos> - Now stop dragging those feet.<eos> - But, it's fun!<eos> Come on!<eos> I have had a series of nightmares... where I'm fired... because of what happened.<eos> You get it?
This is your mother's problem.<eos> Na... vi...<eos> Navier-Stokes.<eos> No picture.<eos> - She didn't solve it?<eos> - No.<eos> She was close.<eos> She would have won the Fields Medal... and probably shared a Nobel... considering what it would have meant for physics.<eos> Maybe I'll have my picture up here someday.<eos> If you really desire it... you can have your picture there, darling.

It takes focus and hard work, but if you succeed... your name will live forever.<eos> Don't be smug, Seymore.<eos> Well, she's had plenty of time.<eos> She traveled yesterday. She slept in a strange bed.<eos> Give her a chance.<eos> At six years old, she read Zimmer.<eos> Outstanding.<eos> How much did she comprehend?<eos> So, Mary...<eos> I see you're looking at our little problem.

Little?<eos> It's big.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why are you so mad all of a sudden?<eos> I'm not mad. I'm annoyed.<eos> Not with you, dear. With that pompous ass, Shankland.<eos> I knew that guy was gonna have a beard before we even went in there.<eos> Math teachers like to grow beards.<eos> I should never have agreed to this in the first place.<eos> Did he really expect you to just walk in and be able to dissect... some random, massive problem?

I should never have agreed to this in the first place.<eos> Did he really expect you to just walk in and be able to dissect... some random, massive problem?<eos> Not much to dissect, if you ask me.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> It was wrong.<eos> What?<eos> Well, for starters, he forgot the negative sign on the exponent.<eos> It went downhill from there.<eos> The problem was unsolvable.<eos> Maybe this school isn't as great as you think it is.

But I don't wanna live with her.<eos> She's bossy.<eos> I've heard that.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Promise?<eos> I promise.<eos> Hi, Mary.<eos> I'm Pat Golding, but you can call me Pat if you like.
I've heard that.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Promise?<eos> I promise.<eos> Hi, Mary.<eos> I'm Pat Golding, but you can call me Pat if you like.<eos> Got it.<eos> Do you know why you're here?
Got it.<eos> Do you know why you're here?<eos> I mean has anyone told you what this is about?<eos> My grandmother wants me to live with her and I wanna stay with Frank.<eos> That's correct.<eos> I'm sure this can all be very scary stuff.<eos> Does any of it worry you?<eos> Nope.<eos> Frank says I'm not goin' anywhere.<eos> Your uncle told you you're not going anywhere?
Roberta's cool.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't watch TV.<eos> But I got hooked on Sponge Bob.<eos> Mostly because Roberta loves it.<eos> And on Saturday nights, we watch the UFC.<eos> The UFC?<eos> Is that... ls that Ultimate Fighting?<eos> Every Saturday.<eos> You and your uncle watch Ultimate Fighting?
Every Saturday.<eos> You and your uncle watch Ultimate Fighting?<eos> Well, you don't just watch it.<eos> Frank turns the sound down and we do the grunting and voices.<eos> Sometimes I attack Frank for real.<eos> Which is really fun for me.<eos> I think if you guys knew Frank, you'd leave us alone.<eos> He can be pretty annoying... but he's a good person.<eos> I think.<eos> Why do you say that?
- Your Honor, this is...<eos> - Your Honor... if there's one thing here that's sadly obvious... it's that Mr. Pollard has never been a genuine guardian of the minor... and his nomination of Mrs. Adler is no less disingenuous.<eos> While the State of Florida gives deference to nomination by a natural parent... I'm inclined to side with Mr. Cullen's laptop... at this time.<eos> Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Don't gloat.<eos> Wouldn't dream of it.<eos> Walk you to your car?<eos> We've been so preoccupied, I'm almost ashamed to ask.<eos> How's Walter?<eos> You wouldn't believe it if I told you.
He had a six gun on his hip... and a saddlebag full of Lipitor.<eos> The fastest asset management in the West.<eos> The man who shot Liberty Mutual.<eos> That's what I've been calling him.<eos> That's really, really funny.<eos> Take her to the airport.<eos> Go home, Evelyn.<eos> Or Montana.<eos> Rustle some cattle.<eos> You know...
Mary, baby, come on HOW. Stop this now.<eos> No.<eos> - Come on out, honey.<eos> - No.<eos> Why did you have to tell her that deadbeat was testifying?<eos> Because it's the truth.<eos> And if I didn't, Evelyn would've.<eos> If I was the dad of a little girl and I never saw her... and I was in the same town...<eos> I would visit her.<eos> Well, I hope you're happy.
I don't understand this.<eos> I thought you were supposed to be on my team.<eos> Why are you bringing me this deal?<eos> Other than I'm required to by law?<eos> You like this deal?<eos> I love this deal.<eos> They think they're gonna lose.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They do.<eos> You think we're gonna lose.
You like this deal?<eos> I love this deal.<eos> They think they're gonna lose.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They do.<eos> You think we're gonna lose.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, Frank.<eos> I gotta go put my kids to bed.<eos> I'll do whatever you want me to do.
They can watch sitcoms with her. Take her to Olive Garden.<eos> Teach her to say "irregardless."<eos> The only saving grace, I suppose, is she's better off than she was.<eos> Goodbye, Frank.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm only 25 minutes away.<eos> Please don't leave me here.<eos> - Please. - No.<eos> Look, you're going to a brand new school, a better school.
Come on.<eos> I'm only 25 minutes away.<eos> Please don't leave me here.<eos> - Please. - No.<eos> Look, you're going to a brand new school, a better school.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I want my crummy school.<eos> - And you got Fred.<eos> - Please.<eos> And once a month you can come back. You can stay with me and Roberta.

Don't do this.<eos> - You promised me.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Please, Frank.<eos> Why are you leaving me?<eos> Because the court said I had to. You know this.
We've discussed this ad naus...<eos> We've discussed this. Come on.<eos> - Come on, please.<eos> - No!<eos> - Hey! Mary.<eos> - No!<eos> Hey, Mary.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Sweetheart, you know what?
- No!<eos> - Hey! Mary.<eos> - No!<eos> Hey, Mary.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Sweetheart, you know what?<eos> No!<eos> There's no easy way to do this.<eos> Not gonna be as long as you think, honey.
- No!<eos> Hey, Mary.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Sweetheart, you know what?<eos> No!<eos> There's no easy way to do this.<eos> Not gonna be as long as you think, honey.<eos> - Frank!<eos> - You're gonna see.
- I know it's hard.<eos> - Come back!<eos> - Mary!<eos> I know.<eos> No!<eos> Frank!<eos> Don't go!<eos> I need you!<eos> Fred needs you!<eos> You promised me!
Not that that's in her best interest.<eos> Not that I'm capable of raising a child.<eos> A child that might still have a mother... if I had taken the time to notice that she needed me.<eos> And now, six and a half years later... I finally got her to the foster family, and you know what? It was great.<eos> She loved it.<eos> I thought it would be a nightmare... of abandonment and betrayal. But, turns out it was a huge success.<eos> I'm a fucking hero.<eos> - Frank...<eos> - No, Bonnie.<eos> I appreciate everything you've done.
- Kevin.<eos> Evelyn is in the guest house.<eos> Yeah, listen.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Frank, let me tell you, she was so helpful with the tutors.<eos> - Mary was so distant. - Hey!<eos> Look, we know what you're up against.<eos> Do you want your life back?<eos> Go back inside.<eos> What are you doing here?
Hey, stop it.<eos> No!<eos> Let me go!<eos> No!<eos> - No! No!<eos> 'Stop, Mary!<eos> - Stop. Stop<eos> - No!<eos> - Come here.<eos> - You lied to me!
- Come here.<eos> - You lied to me!<eos> I know!<eos> - No! No!<eos> 'Stop!<eos> Stop, Stop!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You promised me.
I know!<eos> - No! No!<eos> 'Stop!<eos> Stop, Stop!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You promised me.<eos> I know.<eos> You promised.
They took Fred.<eos> No.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - I got him. He's home.<eos> - What?<eos> He's at the apartment right now. I got him.<eos> For real?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's home kicking around his ping pong ball.<eos> Why did you leave me there?
- What?<eos> He's at the apartment right now. I got him.<eos> For real?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's home kicking around his ping pong ball.<eos> Why did you leave me there?<eos> Because I thought I was bad for you.<eos> And then it dawned on me.<eos> If Mary is this amazing... smart, sweet human being... then I must be doing something right.<eos> You're smiling.
Of all the stunts you could pull.<eos> - Where are they going?<eos> - Nowhere.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You two, out!<eos> - What is this?<eos> - Do you want to know... how Diane told me she finished?<eos> What is this unconscionable lie?<eos> I walked into her apartment and she was sitting on the floor... with that baby in her arms and you know what she said to me?<eos> Admit it. You made this up.
Let's just say Diane didn't tell me, which is nonsense... it's a Millennium Problem.<eos> She would have shared it with the world.<eos> That's where your charade falls apart.<eos> If she had completed the proof, she would have published it.<eos> Diane instructed me very clearly.<eos> That I was only to publish it postmortem.<eos> She died six years ago.<eos> It wasn't her death she was talking about.<eos> I tried to talk her out of it.<eos> But you know how Diane could be when she made her mind up about something.

You're gonna be spending the next few years of your life... defending it.<eos> You won't have time for her.<eos> What if I say no?<eos> Back to Plan A.<eos> Wait for me to die?<eos> I know Diane was hard.<eos> I know she was angry.<eos> But something really good came out of this, Evelyn.<eos> She needs you now.<eos> You're the best woman for the job.
I'm really sorry. I can't hear you.<eos> Could you speak up, please?<eos> Hello?<eos> Evelyn Adler... for Seymore Shankland, please.<eos> And what I want you to notice, is that when you compute P of N... for N congruent to four mod five... the answer is a multiple of five.<eos> So, the first person to notice this was Srinivasa Ramanujan.<eos> In the beginning of the 20th century... he proved that it was the case for all... numbers congruent to four mod five.<eos> So, he proved that P of five N plus four... is congruent to zero mod seven... and that P of eleven N plus six is congruent to zero mod eleven.<eos> Good?<eos> You drive like an old lady.
- She looks very good.<eos> - Very good.<eos> How is she?<eos> She's good.<eos> - Keep working.<eos> - I will.<eos> Niobi.<eos> Diana!<eos> Diana, I see you.<eos> Where are you going?
She's good.<eos> - Keep working.<eos> - I will.<eos> Niobi.<eos> Diana!<eos> Diana, I see you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Slow down!<eos> Hello mother.<eos> How are you today?
- I will.<eos> Niobi.<eos> Diana!<eos> Diana, I see you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Slow down!<eos> Hello mother.<eos> How are you today?<eos> Let's get you back to school, before another tutor quits.<eos> But don't you think it's time to start my training?
But don't you think it's time to start my training?<eos> Antiope thinks I'm ready.<eos> Does she?<eos> I could begin showing her some things.<eos> She should at least be able to defend herself.<eos> From whom?<eos> In the event of an invasion.<eos> Isn't that why, I have the greatest warrior in our history... leading an entire army, General?<eos> I pray day will never come when she has to fight.<eos> But you know, a scorpion must sting...
The only child on the island.<eos> Please let her be so.<eos> But, mother...<eos> There will be no training.<eos> What if I promise to be careful?<eos> It's time to sleep.<eos> What if I didn't use a sword?<eos> Fighting does not make you a hero.<eos> Just the shield then, no sharp edges.<eos> Diana, you are the most precious thing in the world to me.

With his dying breath, Zeus created this island... to hide us from the outside world...<eos> Somewhere Ares could not find us.<eos> And all has been quiet ever since.<eos> We give thanks to the Gods for giving us this paradise.<eos> And the God Killer?<eos> The God Killer?<eos> The weapon that is strong enough to kill a God.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> The Gods gave us many gifts.<eos> One day, you'll know them all.
The Gods gave us many gifts.<eos> One day, you'll know them all.<eos> This great tower is where we keep them.<eos> The God Killer.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Who would be wield it?<eos> I pray it will never be called to arms.<eos> But only the fiercest among us even could.<eos> And that's not you, Diana.<eos> You see?

- I was just...<eos> - Training.<eos> Seems I'm not the revered queen I should be.<eos> Disobeyed, betrayed by my own sister...<eos> No, mother.<eos> It was me.<eos> I asked her...<eos> Take her to the palace.<eos> Off you go.<eos> You left me no choice, Hippolyta.

- Wait, Diana, wait.<eos> What had I done?<eos> I am sorry.<eos> Where did this fog come from?<eos> There...<eos> Go forward.<eos> There he is!<eos> The pilot!<eos> I can see him.<eos> You are a man.
- Anti­ope!<eos> No!<eos> - You.<eos> - No..<eos> No mother no.<eos> He fought at my side<eos> - against the invaders.<eos> - What man fights against his own people?<eos> These aren't my people.<eos> Then, why do you wear their colors?
- You.<eos> - No..<eos> No mother no.<eos> He fought at my side<eos> - against the invaders.<eos> - What man fights against his own people?<eos> These aren't my people.<eos> Then, why do you wear their colors?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> You need to tell us now!
Innocent people... Women and children slaughtered.<eos> Their homes and thier villages looted burned.<eos> Weapons far deadlier than you can... ever imagine.<eos> It's like nothing I've ever seen.<eos> It's like the world's gonna end.<eos> Should we let him go?<eos> And risk him bringing more men to our shores?<eos> We can not hold him forever, my queen.<eos> Mother, excuse me... but after everything the man said, this must be Ares.<eos> What are you talking about, child?
Millions of people already dead.<eos> Like nothing he's ever seen.<eos> Only Ares could do such a thing.<eos> We can not simply let him go.<eos> We must go with him.<eos> I will not deploy our army and leave them scare defences... to go and fight their war.<eos> It's not their war.<eos> Zeus created man to be just, and wise, strong and passionate...<eos> That was a story, Diana!<eos> This much, you do not understand?

A watch?<eos> Yeah, it's a watch.<eos> Tells time.<eos> My father gave it to me.<eos> Went through hell 'n back with him.<eos> Now it's for me and, good thing it's still ticking..<eos> What for?<eos> Because it tells time.<eos> When to eat, sleep, wake up, work...<eos> You let this little thing tell you what to do?
What is this place?<eos> Who are you people?<eos> Why does the water do that?<eos> How come you don't know what a watch is?<eos> How can you speak English so well?<eos> We speak hundreds of languages.<eos> We are the bridge to a greater understanding between all men.<eos> Right.<eos> I didn't get a chance to say this... earlier, but thank you for dragging me out of the water.<eos> Thank you... for what you did on the beach.
Or anyone.<eos> In Amazon..<eos> The Amazons.<eos> The Amazons?<eos> It is our sacred duty to defend the world.<eos> And I wish to go..<eos> But my mother will not allow it.<eos> Well... I can't say I blame her.<eos> The way this war's going... I don't wanna let anyone I care about near.<eos> Then why do you want to go back?

I don't wanna let anyone I care about near.<eos> Then why do you want to go back?<eos> I don't think "want" is the word, right?<eos> I guess I gotta try.<eos> My father told me once he said...<eos> "If you see something wrong happening in the world... "you can either do nothing, or you can do something."

"you can either do nothing, or you can do something."<eos> And I already tried nothing.<eos> Nice outfit.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I'll show you the way off the Island... and you'll take me to Ares.
Of course I know how to sail.<eos> Why wouldn't I know how to sail?<eos> It's just... It's been a while.<eos> I am going, mother.<eos> I cannot stand by while innocent lives are lost.<eos> If no one else will defend the world from Ares, then I must.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I know.<eos> Or at least I know I can not stop you.<eos> There is so much... So much you do not understand.

So much you do not understand.<eos> I understand enough.<eos> But I'm willing to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.<eos> Like you once did.

But I'm willing to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.<eos> Like you once did.<eos> You know that if you choose to leave... you may never return.<eos> Who will I be if I stay?<eos> This belonged to the greatest warrior in our history... our beloved Anti­ope.<eos> Make sure you're worthy of it.<eos> I will.<eos> Be careful in the world of men, Diana.<eos> They do not deserve you.<eos> You've been my greatest love.

They do not deserve you.<eos> You've been my greatest love.<eos> Today... you are my greatest sorrow.<eos> Should you have told her?<eos> The more she knows, the sooner he will find her.<eos> How long until we reach the war?<eos> The war, which part?<eos> The Western Front in France is... 400 miles long, from the Alps to the North Sea.<eos> Where the fighting is the most intense then.<eos> If you take me there, I'm sure I'll find Ares.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.<eos> With this.<eos> And once I do... the war will end.<eos> I appreciate your spirit... but this war is...<eos> And there's not a whole lot you and I can do about that.<eos> I mean, we can get back to London and try to look for men who can.<eos> I'm the man who can!<eos> Once I find and destroy Ares... the German armies will be freed from his influence... they will good men again and the world will be better.<eos> Great.<eos> You will see.

Not polite to assume, you know?<eos> "Marriage"?<eos> Marriage!<eos> You don't have...<eos> You go before a judge... and you swear to love, honor and cherish each other... Until death do you apart.<eos> And do they.. love each other till death?<eos> Not very often, no.<eos> Then why do they do it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> So you cannot sleep with me unless
You know, where I come from, I'm not considered average.<eos> You know, um.. being a spy... you must show a certain amount of... vigor.<eos> Have you never met a man before?<eos> What about your father?<eos> I have no father.<eos> My mother sculpted me from clay... and I was brought to life by Zeus.<eos> Well that's neat.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Where I come from.. babies are made differently.<eos> You refer to reproductive biology.
- Yeah, I know.<eos> I know all about that.<eos> I mean I refer to that and other things.<eos> The pleasures of the flesh.<eos> Do you know about that?<eos> I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's criticism on earthly pleasures<eos> - 12 huh?<eos> - Mm hm.<eos> Did you bring any of those with you?<eos> You would not enjoy them.
To the war!<eos> Well, technically, the war is that way.<eos> But we gotta get this way first.<eos> And where are we going?<eos> We gotta get this notebook to my superiors.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No! I let you go.<eos> You take me to Ares.
Which prince is that?<eos> I-I decided to extend your profanity...<eos> But seriously, which prince?<eos> Hey, Sultan, Angoora, Next Kashmir...<eos> Care to talk for a minute?<eos> Gentlemen, excuse me one second.<eos> - A bar...<eos> Well, a pub.<eos> - You hypocrite.<eos> I've been... racing those peacock all night, and you've...
What's the going rate?<eos> Better be a good pay.<eos> Yeah, well, here's the thing.<eos> Um, I told you... will be quick.<eos> And there's-there's a lot to be gained by this.<eos> So, it's for a great cause...<eos> Freedom. - Um.<eos> Friendship...<eos> Huh! Ending the war, friendship...<eos> - Okay, You have no money.

Ending the war, friendship...<eos> - Okay, You have no money.<eos> - No.<eos> All I want right now is a picture of your lovely face.<eos> You won't need a picture...
It is over.<eos> It's over for you.<eos> It is over for all of you..<eos> But the mask won't help.<eos> - They don't know that. - Huh!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Time to stage a demonstration for the Kaiser!<eos> You're late.<eos> Avoid sneak attack, chief!<eos> How are you?
How are you?<eos> - Good to see you pal.<eos> - Big mike.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Oh yes!<eos> Good to see you my friend.<eos> Yaa beauty!<eos> Who is this?<eos> And I am Diana.<eos> Where did you find her?
- What are we waiting for?<eos> - We can not leave without helping them.<eos> These people are dying.<eos> Nothing to eat and in the village...<eos> - enslaved it there!<eos> - I understand that.<eos> - Women and children!<eos> - We need to make our<eos> - next position by sunset.<eos> - How can you say that?
- Sir...<eos> How likely is he to respect my wishes?<eos> Not very like convinced.<eos> Sammy, Sammy, no, no.<eos> Sammy, I have to work.<eos> I gotta rustle up with a German uniform I took to plough the course tomorrow.<eos> That's easy, boss.<eos> Come on.<eos> There's nothing we can do till tomorrow.<eos> You said yourself, Steve. So...
Be polite.<eos> All right.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Like so.<eos> And I'll put my arm... around you like so.<eos> And we just..<eos> What do you call it?<eos> Sway?<eos> We'll just sway.<eos> You're awfully close.
I guess.<eos> What is that like?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> The villagers gave them to us.<eos> - A gracious gift.<eos> - And they call us heroes.<eos> You are.<eos> Hey, fellas, I know that...<eos> I said this job was 2 day's... and a... deal is a deal.<eos> You can't last without us.

No more money.<eos> We have been paid enough.<eos> _<eos> No, Charlie.<eos> Who will sing for us?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh no, please.<eos> Sing?<eos> You asked for it.<eos> You must think I was born yesterday.
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.<eos> Every word.<eos> Wait... wait.<eos> There is a whole island of women like her?<eos> And not a single man among them?<eos> How do we get there?<eos> And she thinks.. that Ludendorff is Ares, the God of war?<eos> And only by killing him will the war end.<eos> Don't be daft.<eos> You saw what happened out there.
And she thinks.. that Ludendorff is Ares, the God of war?<eos> And only by killing him will the war end.<eos> Don't be daft.<eos> You saw what happened out there.<eos> The way she dropped that machine gun next.<eos> The way she took out the tower?<eos> May be it's true.<eos> I think it's true.<eos> I believe it's true.<eos> Steven son, you don't really believe those rubbish thing?
May be it's true.<eos> I think it's true.<eos> I believe it's true.<eos> Steven son, you don't really believe those rubbish thing?<eos> Diana, Diana, hide in..<eos> How the hell do we get into that?<eos> I see only a couple of guards in the door to distract.<eos> Yeah, it won't look suspicious... when I wanna come sauntering out of the woods.<eos> I could get in.<eos> You are not going in there, it's too dangerous.

Stay put!<eos> Where this come from?<eos> A field over there.<eos> It is full of them!<eos> Chief, I think you and me scope out the area... in case we need to beat the haste and retreat.<eos> - What do you say, Diana? - Huh?<eos> Colonel.<eos> Steve, they have invitations.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Play it cool, you go this, you got this.
Your invitation, please.<eos> Thank you sir. The Colonel and I wish... many blessings and all my love to fall up in your head.<eos> Your head must be empty.<eos> Find the invitation, you idiot.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I am so sorry, I must apologize a thousand times, my master.<eos> I made the most horrible, the most unforgivable mistake.<eos> - I lost the Colonel's invitation.<eos> - What?<eos> You saying we come all the way through the mud and rain...

A God who requires human sacrifices.<eos> And in exchange... war gives man purpose... meaning, a chance to rise... above his petty, mortal little self... and be courageous...<eos> Noble!<eos> _<eos> Only one of the many Gods believed in that.<eos> - Um. - And he was wrong.<eos> You know nothing of the Gods.<eos> Herr General.<eos> Enjoy the fireworks.<eos> What are you doing?

- I saw him, he was in the tower.<eos> Wherever he goes you follow.<eos> How will you find us?<eos> I know how.<eos> Diana!<eos> They are dead.<eos> They are all dead.<eos> I could have saved them.<eos> I could have saved them if it weren't for you.<eos> - You stopped me from killing Ares!
He followed Ludendorff.<eos> Follow the smoke!<eos> Hey! Diana, Over there!<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Ooh, what a surprise.<eos> Strange.<eos> Unfortunately, I have another matter... to attend to.<eos> What are you?<eos> You will soon find out.
- Diana, people... I...<eos> She was right.<eos> My mother was right.<eos> She said the world of men do not deserve you.<eos> They don't deserve our help, Steve.<eos> - It's not about deserve!<eos> - They do not deserve our help.<eos> Maybe, Maybe we don't!<eos> But it's not about that.<eos> It's about what you believe.

But we can stop that plane.<eos> If we could get on the radio... we can ask flying corp to shoot her down.<eos> No.<eos> If it crashes, it will wipe everyone out for 50 square miles.<eos> We gotta ground it!<eos> Bad news.<eos> It's on a timer.<eos> If we ground it here, it's the same thing.<eos> Is it flammable, Chief?<eos> Yes, you said it's hydrogen. It's flammable.
- Hey, Steve!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> This way!<eos> Steve!<eos> - Come on, Steve.<eos> - Ahead!<eos> Go!<eos> Steve!<eos> Let's see what kind of God you really are.

Or you will die.<eos> Come on!<eos> Move, move, let's go!<eos> Go. Go.<eos> Go.<eos> - Now! Go.<eos> - Go!<eos> Run!<eos> Is that all you have to offer?<eos> It is futile to imagine you can win.
Anything left?<eos> I got nothing.<eos> - Anything!<eos> - No!<eos> Steve.<eos> Steve.<eos> No!<eos> Yes, Diana!<eos> Take them all!<eos> Finally you see.
Mankind did this, not me.<eos> They are ugly... filled with hatred... weak... Just like your captain Trevor.<eos> Gone and left you nothing.<eos> And for what?<eos> Pathetic!<eos> They deserved to burn!<eos> Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.<eos> She is the perfect example of these humans... and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.<eos> Destroy her, Diana.<eos> You know that she deserves.
She is the perfect example of these humans... and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.<eos> Destroy her, Diana.<eos> You know that she deserves.<eos> That they all do.<eos> Do it!<eos> Diana!<eos> Diana...<eos> What?<eos> We have to go.<eos> What are you saying?
Steve...<eos> - Whatever it is, I can do it.<eos> - No..<eos> - Let me do it.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> It has to be me.<eos> It has to be me.<eos> I could save today.<eos> You can save the world.
- Let me do it.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> It has to be me.<eos> It has to be me.<eos> I could save today.<eos> You can save the world.<eos> I wish we had more time.<eos> What?<eos> What are you saying?

- Yeah!<eos> Whatever it takes to keep it running!<eos> This is a cuban spirit.<eos> Your spirit, keep it up. Never ever lose that.<eos> Dom..<eos> It's your cousin..<eos> He's in trouble, come quickly!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Please don't do this, Understand my problem.<eos> You know I can't make living without my car.

The Racer and his dad.<eos> - The one with the boat engine.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I was looking at them, and I..<eos> And I couldn't help but too imagine what you'd be like, if you were dad.

I'd love to play games.<eos> Beaten the bests alone.<eos> I'm kinda in a rush, so if you got something to say...<eos> Oh this is a very different game that I can assure you.<eos> This..?<eos> There is something much greater at work here.<eos> This is fate.<eos> - I choose to make my own fate.<eos> - Not today.<eos> This is the road you take to your apartment every morning.

- Hey, Dom.<eos> - Hey, Hobbs.<eos> We got a job in Berlin, and I need a favor, brother.<eos> No problem.<eos> I grab the team and meet you in Berlin.<eos> Thanks man.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> You were only to supposed to create a diversion, Roman.<eos> That was a diversion.<eos> How many of the damn explosives did you use?
- Phase 2?<eos> So you just gonna keep that to yourself?<eos> What happen to Phase 1?<eos> What about that part?<eos> Yeah, remember the airplane?<eos> Everyone drove their cars out but you.<eos> I told you my engine seized up.<eos> It's your balls that seized up?<eos> Just follow my lead, okay?<eos> And Roman, whatever you do.
Just follow my lead, okay?<eos> And Roman, whatever you do.<eos> Don't think.<eos> Tez, drop it.<eos> Bomb's away.<eos> Split now!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Look out..!<eos> - Great plan Tez.<eos> - Just so you know.

Burner phone, right?<eos> Nah.<eos> Scrambled.<eos> Same number but they got some sort of micro-router..<eos> ..to bury the signal path which means Dom is clearly..<eos> Look, I do not know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts.<eos> Dom's been having highly encrypted conversation with some mysterious person.<eos> He took out Hobbs.<eos> He stole the EMP, now he's disappeared.<eos> So what're you saying?

He's still working from the manual.<eos> I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.<eos> Oh come on. Give him a break.<eos> Get a break.<eos> Luke?<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> - It's good to see you, Nobody.<eos> - You too.<eos> Rule No.1, know your audience.<eos> I gave you your shot, you shit the bed.

.. gone bad.<eos> Huh?<eos> Such a cliche.<eos> Ah well.<eos> Welcome to the club.<eos> I wouldn't get that twisted son.<eos> We ain't in no club.<eos> We got nothing in common.<eos> And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.<eos> You bring the shovel did you?
Better get to dig in.<eos> You wanker.<eos> Move..<eos> Say that again.<eos> If I say it again, It will be to acorpse.<eos> I'm going to enjoy this.<eos> Welcome back, Dom.<eos> Nice job out there.<eos> Excited about tonight?<eos> You're going on this?
Excited about tonight?<eos> You're going on this?<eos> You're with me Dom.<eos> - Showing me your shoe collection?<eos> - Yup.<eos> A pair for every occasion.<eos> There's enough guns here to outfit a small army.<eos> Huh?<eos> Oh this is just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> You know what I like about you, Dom.

But it's about something bigger.<eos> This way...<eos> I changed them.<eos> That's not your responsibility.<eos> - That's who I am.<eos> - Is it?<eos> Let me ask you something Dom, what's the best thing in your life?<eos> - Family.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> But if you're being honest?

Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently...

Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently...<eos> It's bullshit.<eos> It's not you.<eos> Be who you are.<eos> Why live only a quarter mile at a time, when you can live your whole life that way?<eos> See all those blow that muscles will give you.<eos> All show and no..<eos> Well I got plenty of goal.<eos> You must have misplaced that.
Yeah.<eos> Just like you Brits, rewriting History, huh?<eos> All I know.<eos> It was not me who was thrown out of a 4 storey window.<eos> Jumped.<eos> I jumped out of a 4 storey window.<eos> Saving my partner's life.<eos> Because where I'm from, we don't settle fight by throwing bombs.<eos> Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.<eos> I mean, do you really believe you could stand in front of me?
It does not matter who I am, Tez I'm like Nobody ok?<eos> Nobody, then who is he?<eos> He's nothing he's like less than me.<eos> Clearly we're getting nowhere, with nobody.<eos> I've been in here for 4 hours, my ribs are sore.<eos> I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.<eos> - I wouldn't recommend that.<eos> - What?<eos> Well, thanks to your bust Berlin job.<eos> You all made interpol's top 10 most wanted list.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.<eos> - I wouldn't recommend that.<eos> - What?<eos> Well, thanks to your bust Berlin job.<eos> You all made interpol's top 10 most wanted list.<eos> Top 10?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> That's alright.<eos> Well, not you.<eos> What do you mean?

They, she, can manipulate world systems under shadows.<eos> Anything that can be hacked..<eos> And here is the kicker.<eos> You will never find her linked to any other.<eos> Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds worldwide.<eos> So basically, she is the boogeyman.<eos> Yeah, she is.<eos> One of the hottest boogeyman I have ever seen, I mean...<eos> If y'all know her, tell her to get extra boy.<eos> - What are you, 12?
- So y'all want us...<eos> To track Dom.<eos> And I know Roman, it's kinda a big job.<eos> - It's impossible.<eos> - Which is why...<eos> I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.<eos> Ah.<eos> My day just got a whole hell of a lot better.<eos> Mr. Nobody you want to tell me why you just put me in a room with this teen crumpeting criminal, some bitch.<eos> You got a big mouth on a small head.

You got a big mouth on a small head.<eos> Coming from prisoner 6753.<eos> Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.<eos> We're not... teaming up with this guy.<eos> Let's get one thing clear.<eos> I ain't on your team.<eos> I don't care about you, you crew...<eos> Your little family.<eos> I'm here for Cipher.<eos> You gonna do apply for a job, Head-asshole?
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.<eos> We're not... teaming up with this guy.<eos> Let's get one thing clear.<eos> I ain't on your team.<eos> I don't care about you, you crew...<eos> Your little family.<eos> I'm here for Cipher.<eos> You gonna do apply for a job, Head-asshole?<eos> You don't think that tight t-shirt is cutting off the circulation to your brain.<eos> You should get bigger size.
You should get bigger size.<eos> Cipher came to me first.<eos> Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.<eos> When I said no, she went off to my brother.<eos> Oh Yes.<eos> Brother Owen who could forget him?<eos> Former hell-raiser and current guest, at a nasty little black site prison.<eos> Cipher corrupted him left him for dead.<eos> So if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, flicks I'm taking it.<eos> You're taking my boot right up your ass.
I'm gonna take that as a yes.<eos> Am I the only one seeing this?<eos> Oh, this oughtta be good.<eos> Use God's eye.<eos> We put our lives on the line..<eos> Running around the world trying to figure this thing out.<eos> It can find anybody, right?<eos> Let's use it to find Dom.<eos> Roman, that is a great idea.<eos> Did you hear that?
And so...<eos> God's eye was where we start.<eos> Cipher's already created an evasion that masked her location by..<eos> Pinging random spots all over the globe.<eos> But it was a good thought Roman.<eos> So she's made my programme obsolete.<eos> And that Ramsey..<eos> - is why are you here.<eos> - See, simple solutions... aren't gonna cut it here slick.<eos> Why are you looking at me when you're saying that?
Which means it has a decaying sync quantanizer.<eos> Which we can reverse.<eos> And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.<eos> Telling you, they got skills.<eos> That was my idea.<eos> That's what I was saying, remember in there?<eos> Alright.<eos> Let's try this.<eos> It's working..<eos> Time you wanna take your manual and start organizing first response...
Nice to see you again.<eos> Look at this, bodies not even cold Dom.<eos> Your family's already replacing you.<eos> You chose the loosing team.<eos> I guess your brother is smarter than you.<eos> Smart move embedding God's eye into the mainframe.<eos> Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Dom!<eos> You're gonna turn your back on family?

- No.<eos> We can't bring Bryan and Mia into this.<eos> We agreed on that.<eos> I know.<eos> Back there was that for her, for me, or you?<eos> Or was it either necessary?<eos> Necessary?<eos> Nothing is necessary.<eos> Everything is a choice.<eos> I simply made one but so did you.

That his middle name.<eos> I thought his father should give him first name.<eos> I'm sorry, Dom.<eos> There is nothing to be sorry for.<eos> Whatever happens...<eos> Just save our son.<eos> Your son.<eos> Good visit?<eos> I know.<eos> I know what you're thinking.
I'm sorry, Dom.<eos> There is nothing to be sorry for.<eos> Whatever happens...<eos> Just save our son.<eos> Your son.<eos> Good visit?<eos> I know.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> I just let the guards go, so there is only two opponents in the room.<eos> Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first, I know you.

You want to see the old Dom?<eos> Watch.<eos> Damn it..<eos> She wiped it off. Took God's eye.<eos> That was the one thing we could use to find him.<eos> We lost everything.<eos> - Yeah, princess?<eos> - Find it to rail.<eos> But I've got couple of minutes to spare.<eos> If you want me to send you to the hospital again.
Dom will never see it coming.<eos> It's neon orange,<eos> The international space station would see it coming.<eos> Go choose anything less inspeculous.<eos> No no.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Hey my man, you can put that down right there.<eos> This is a gift.<eos> A real gift.<eos> I know what you're doing.
Hey my man, you can put that down right there.<eos> This is a gift.<eos> A real gift.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> I like your beard.<eos> You're blanta.<eos> Black santa?<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> Put it down right here..<eos> What are you doing?
You're blanta.<eos> Black santa?<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> Put it down right here..<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Engine's mis-firing, I gotta check it out.<eos> No. That's not part of the plan, Dom.<eos> Clearly..<eos> But unless you want the engine to cease on the job,<eos> You have five minutes.
But unless you want the engine to cease on the job,<eos> You have five minutes.<eos> I want another visual.<eos> I got an ATM<eos> I don't like this.<eos> I want to see Toretto.<eos> There are no more cameras.<eos> Then find something.<eos> Punch in on something reflective A car mirror, anything..<eos> - You know who I am?

To give you something back.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Something's not right here.<eos> First time I saw my son... was behind a bulletproof glass.<eos> When he reached me, I couldn't hold on.<eos> It's the worst pain I ever felt..<eos> I know you know exactly how that feels.<eos> Maybe we could change that..<eos> I think..<eos> You are about to suggest something really dodgy Mr Toretto.

To a traitor.<eos> Some about this old thing just doesn't add up to me.<eos> Well then don't do the same kind of funny math,<eos> It says a DSS agent who has a soul to stop a valid stolen EMP.<eos> Sound familiar huh?<eos> Wanna give me a hand?<eos> - On three?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> One two..<eos> You know, you can tell this in another letter..
One two..<eos> You know, you can tell this in another letter..<eos> But maybe we could've caused some serious damage.<eos> - Yes, we could have.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Shame I'll have to punch you, head of defend, when this is all over.<eos> Ah well.<eos> With all due respect, Captain,<eos> When this whole thing is over we're gonna find a location and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat.<eos> You're gonna stick a toothbrush right up in your ass to brush up.
Meet you at the pick-up.<eos> I think I know where my team's at.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Right in front of me.<eos> This is on you. Get out of there, Dom.<eos> Guys, I know why Dom's here.<eos> Police scanners are saying he's stolen Nuclear Football.<eos> It's over, Toretto.<eos> Get your ass out of the car now.<eos> That's how you wanna play this?

Get out of there.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Stop working on it, and do it..<eos> No, no no...<eos> It's my Bentley.<eos> No!<eos> Get that case and run!<eos> Move!<eos> They thought... this was gonna be a streetfight.<eos> You wait for it..

Let's go then.<eos> Anything?<eos> They're gone.<eos> And D.O.D confirmed it was a nuclear football.<eos> He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.<eos> I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.<eos> Deckard?<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> I'm disappointed in you, Dom.<eos> You're gonna Letty just walk away with the codes.

And now I have to make one on my own.<eos> They are adorable little things, aren't they?<eos> I hope I don't hurt him.<eos> Look, Cipher, I did exactly what you asked me to do.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> - This is your doing.<eos> - My doing?<eos> Please don't hurt him.<eos> I'm begging you.<eos> I don't want you to beg.

I recognize that guy.<eos> That's Connor Rhodes.<eos> I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.<eos> He wanted us to get the Nightshade device him.<eos> Connor Rhodes.<eos> He's also linked to somebody who I like to forget.<eos> Mose Jakande.<eos> Warlord who tried to get God's eye.<eos> Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.<eos> Everything you're feeling right now, that's rage, sense of loss.
It's not real.<eos> It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains.<eos> To ensure continuation of species.<eos> When early men went visit a watering hole...<eos> If they didn't watch their child, they got snatched by a crocodile.<eos> Their brains would create a painful but a structural memory.<eos> So it will never happen again.<eos> This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world...<eos> It's a biological lie.<eos> You don't have to accept it.

Taking your son got me the codes..<eos> The codes will get me the nukes, and the nukes will get me what I want...<eos> Today, tomorrow... and every day after that.<eos> What's that?<eos> Accountability.<eos> The second I fire off one of those nukes..<eos> I put the superpowers of this world on notice that when they cross the line,<eos> ...I'm gonna be there to hold the responsible..<eos> Because the truth is, Dom To the world out there I'm the crocodile at the watering hole.<eos> You've got one last job to do.
So, any other suggestions?<eos> Yeah, I got one.<eos> How about we just stop them ourselves?<eos> You're talking about a Russian Military Base.<eos> Separatists.<eos> Whatever.<eos> It's suicide.<eos> It's stopping world war 3.<eos> What's it gonna be rook?<eos> You're gonna close your eyes on this one too?
Areal transport leaves in an hour.<eos> Take whatever vehicle you want.<eos> - All bets are off.<eos> - All bets are off.<eos> Bets are off?<eos> See you later...<eos> Letty I don't like telling you this one thing,<eos> The game's changed.<eos> Before we were trying just to catch Dom, but now after all of this...<eos> I want you to know, if I have to... I'm gonna put him down..

Ladies know me.<eos> They know where I'm at with.<eos> I try to take a piss, I ain't even recognize myself.<eos> Now that's entirely too much information.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> Well, one thing is for sure.<eos> Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a train cause no one will be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.<eos> I wouldn't be so sure about that.<eos> Speak of the Devil.<eos> Alright, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
Raise the barricade, As soon as possible.<eos> We've lost power, get to your positions now.<eos> Gates are open.<eos> Let's get this party started.<eos> - EMP's are charging.<eos> - How long?<eos> 60 seconds.<eos> Alright, Dom, You've one pulse left in that EMP.<eos> That sub is heavily insulated.<eos> You're gonna need to be right underneath it, for this thing to work.
Damn it, she's good.<eos> They are entering the Weapon's room.<eos> Oh that's cute.<eos> Go, pull pull!<eos> Roman, guard up by the chip, go.<eos> Oh she's slick.<eos> Gonna have to do better in that way.<eos> Ok, now you're starting to piss me off.<eos> Ramsey, how much time we talking to you?<eos> You're smart, but no smart enough.

Tez we got no idea what the hell we are looking for.<eos> I got it.<eos> What in the hell are you guys doing?<eos> It wasn't me, okay?<eos> It will be labeled "Guidance Go".<eos> - Ok.<eos> I got something.<eos> - What?<eos> It says haha.. slack slack back ...smoke, dear jack na jack.<eos> Do you understand that?
- What?<eos> It says haha.. slack slack back ...smoke, dear jack na jack.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Well, nasty.<eos> Quite a show.<eos> Arming the nuke..<eos> Nuke's going hot, she's trying to fire this thing.<eos> - Roger that, we're moving out.<eos> - Disable the nukes.<eos> Roman, what are you seeing?
No.<eos> No.<eos> Don't press that.<eos> I got it.<eos> Something is wrong.<eos> It won't launch.<eos> Get that sub out of there.<eos> Now!<eos> Move your ass Roman.<eos> You alright?
A lot of company.<eos> Alright team, here is the plan.<eos> There is a Sea lock at the opening of the bay,<eos> We get there first, and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water.<eos> And disappearing forever.<eos> I've got the location.<eos> It's 10 miles south west.<eos> 10 miles?<eos> Like I make it in 10 seconds.<eos> What's the matter Roman, you forgot the snow tyre?
10 miles?<eos> Like I make it in 10 seconds.<eos> What's the matter Roman, you forgot the snow tyre?<eos> Loving that Lambo now?<eos> Alright everyone, hold you with that launch trip later.<eos> Right now I want that sub, in deep water, where no one can find it.<eos> Find me the fastest route out of that bay.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Why are they shooting at me?<eos> I think off you're in that orange Lamborghini I don't know.

The arseholes ain't gonna kill themselves.<eos> Pull up surveillance, right now.<eos> Surprise.<eos> Pierce must be dead.<eos> You're driving.<eos> I said it from the beginning.<eos> No way, I'm not driving.<eos> We have a security breach in the cargo hold.<eos> Take care of it now.<eos> Jesus Mum, you should pose to avoid the nerves.
Take care of it now.<eos> Jesus Mum, you should pose to avoid the nerves.<eos> Oh, shut up, don't be such a baby.<eos> Get to the pilot, he's got the second key.<eos> Wait for my signal.<eos> Give Cipher my regards.<eos> Did Torretto hold up his end of the deal?<eos> He gave us this little thing here.<eos> No, don't touch.<eos> You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.

- It's called the God's eyes.<eos> - Yeah, well.<eos> Whatever.<eos> There's no way I'm using Owen, alright?<eos> He's a lost cause.<eos> He's your brother, Deck.<eos> He's my son.<eos> He's our family.<eos> And our family that died... Bloody shit happening.<eos> You lied about, I mean, I can't believe you.

That was for Letty.<eos> - Rhodes.<eos> - He is no longer with us.<eos> Rhodes picked the wrong target.<eos> Congratulations Dom.<eos> You just killed your son.<eos> You are wrong.<eos> I just saved him.<eos> And you just took your foot off the tiger's neck.<eos> You're welcome.
He just saved our asses.<eos> Good to be riding with you again man.<eos> Torretto just cleared the way for them.<eos> Someone give me something.<eos> - Torpedoes are ready.<eos> - Then launch them.<eos> - Take the wheel.<eos> - I ain't taking shit.<eos> - Take the wheel!<eos> - Where are you doing?
- Speed up,<eos> - Left and back!<eos> - What?<eos> Turn the goddamn wheel to the left, really quickly.<eos> Boom, baby!<eos> That's alright!<eos> Back in the sink.<eos> Where is that smile?<eos> There it is!<eos> You're gonna shoot a baby You shoud bust it...

Is that you or him?<eos> Him.<eos> Good.<eos> The torpedo's missed, they are gonna reach lock before the sub does.<eos> The hell they are.<eos> Get ready for this.<eos> Oh shit!<eos> We're going to need a bigger truck.<eos> - Get us out of here.<eos> - Why are you always yelling?
- Look out!<eos> That's not good.<eos> That's not good.<eos> We got this.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> The sub's too close.<eos> We ain't making it to the gate in time.<eos> We just gonna let it get away?<eos> Not if I know Dom.<eos> You loose.
Put a heat-seeker on him now.<eos> Now!<eos> That's a goddamn heat seeker coming at us.<eos> Oh my... come and get it.<eos> Guys!<eos> Dive..<eos> This...<eos> This is for my son!<eos> Dom!<eos> You are out of bullets Deckard.

You pulled my family through.<eos> A mother.<eos> I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.<eos> To anyone.<eos> There is only one flaw in your plan.<eos> What's that?<eos> Only one of us has a parachute!<eos> Told you this would be fun!<eos> Time to land, Boys!<eos> You know I've never left you, Letty?

Hey Dom!<eos> I'm just towing it out there?<eos> We need to get up out of here.<eos> Cause this all kinda neuclearism happening under this ice.<eos> Relax!<eos> Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.<eos> Ok.<eos> So we good then.<eos> Lemme go and get my young selfie levels up.<eos> You realize this is classified, right?
Lemme go and get my young selfie levels up.<eos> You realize this is classified, right?<eos> Not today.<eos> We have to get up out of here man.<eos> I'm freezing.<eos> It's Okay.<eos> Don't worry, he's gonna be here soon.<eos> I get it, y'all got a lot in common.<eos> Computer hacks, god's eyes, geeks, nerd.<eos> ..you know, but we got a lot in common too!
There's a problem.<eos> I am asking the real question right now.<eos> Is it gonna be... the Nerd or...<eos> the dark knight?<eos> To be honest I like both of you.<eos> A'rigt!<eos> Yeah..yea!<eos> But just before we get into all of that,<eos> Let me ask you one question.<eos> - You can ask me anything.
I figured it's time for a little break.<eos> Wow.<eos> Daddy's stayin' home.<eos> - Nobody.<eos> - Get in touch!<eos> Ah, hang on a second.<eos> This could be interesting.<eos> What made you think I would do it?<eos> Brother-hood.<eos> I saw that look you gave Cipher.

All this fuss of you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Alena, I promise to keep our son safe.<eos> And now.. he always will be.<eos> I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe.<eos> Who will never give up on me.<eos> You've heard me say.<eos> "That you never turn your back on family."<eos> And I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.<eos> You wanna meet them?
Dear Joshua.<eos> I know it's been nearly six years since you heard from me.
Dear Joshua.<eos> I know it's been nearly six years since you heard from me.<eos> I can't believe you're already in tenth grade.
Welcome.<eos> That's for you, man.<eos> Picked that out myself.<eos> Something in there just to get you started.<eos> - Appreciate it.<eos> - Got a big night planned for you, bro.<eos> Youngster ride there, that's Howie.<eos> He's the man with the plan.<eos> - Should give you the welcome home party.<eos> - Told you he'd know who you were.

Fuck, let's go eat, man.<eos> Whatever you want is on me.
Welcome home, brother.<eos> - Jason Horvath.<eos> It's an honor.<eos> How about the name Chef, huh?<eos> Name mean anything to you?<eos> Hell, every tweaker south of Folsom knows that name.<eos> Any one of these bitches in here, they're all fucking dirt legs, dude.<eos> I'm telling you, man.<eos> Every single one of them, man, they're fucking cheerleaders, brother.<eos> You can literally do whatever the fuck you want to them.

Go, go, go. Come on, move.<eos> Fuck!<eos> This ride clean?<eos> Insurance is up to date, reg, everything.<eos> I need it tonight.<eos> Tell me where to drop you off. I'll pull over here.<eos> Catch the bus.<eos> - They said you're not inked.<eos> Nothing.<eos> You answer only to me now.

You got it.<eos> Get two prepaid cells, both of them different.<eos> Then be at my motel at 10 a.m.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Charge.<eos> No basket.<eos> Charge?<eos> It's a pick-up game.<eos> It's a foul!<eos> You can't take a little bump 'n grind, get off the court. It's all right.
You know the rules, bud.<eos> How was school today?<eos> We made masks for President's Day. Uh-huh. I picked Abraham Lincoln.<eos> I also made his hat.<eos> That's so cool.<eos> I can't wait to see it.<eos> Turn the TV back on when you're done, okay?<eos> Mom upstairs? - Yeah.<eos> Hey, babe. Hey.<eos> You know, we got 45 minutes before we pick up
Does everyone use the same house for finals?<eos> Yes.<eos> Even playing field.<eos> Damn, I wanna live there. I know, right?<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What did I do?<eos> It's just-I just gotta...<eos> I felt that coming.<eos> You shouldn't have.<eos> Jennifer, I also want to let you know that I've been eating asparagus.
Can we fight it?<eos> Yeah. I mean, we can go to trial, but... I gotta be honest, man, the evidence is pretty overwhelming.<eos> It didn't help the intersection had a traffic camera, either.<eos> My advice is, you let me go to the prosecutor now, get him to make a deal.<eos> Because if we go to trial, he will stick to the maximums.<eos> That's what they do.<eos> That's how it works. What kind of deal?<eos> Look, you agree to a no-contest plea... I think I can get him to two years on count one, reduce the great bodily injury enhancement... to what's called a DUI with injury.<eos> Now, that drops the additional three years to eight months.<eos> It means... realistically you'd only have to do 16 months.
Thank you, homes.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> What about you? You got a lady, got kids?<eos> Used to.<eos> The world went on without us, huh?<eos> Feel for you, homes.<eos> I do.<eos> Spent 17 years total inside.<eos> What a fucking waste.<eos> You know why I asked The Beast for you to handle this?

Boom.<eos> Whole cache of AKs and Glocks were down in a hidden tunnel.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They just piled them in there.<eos> So I sealed it up, didn't tell my C.O.<eos> Fucking Muj's, they'd just used them against us anyway.<eos> So I found these contractor dudes who agreed to load them in a container heading back to the States.<eos> Cost me a hundred of the AKs...<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> You're telling me there's just 900 now.
Wait, wait.<eos> You're telling me there's just 900 now.<eos> No. There was 11 hundred to start.<eos> I figured a hundred was pretty cheap to get them home but then again we're talking about Soviet factory full-autos, not that cheap-ass Chinese knock-off bullshit.<eos> He said he needed to see you, Money.<eos> Fucking knucklehead skins from the party, man.<eos> I said to them, I said, lay the fuck low. They didn't listen to me, okay?<eos> They've been butting heads with these fucking Crippers from the beach.<eos> Those Toads, they knew that house.<eos> So you're telling me it was a drive-by.
It sure didn't feel random, that gun aimed at my face.<eos> Hey, look, it's on me.<eos> This is fucking on me.<eos> But I'm gonna fucking hit them. I'm gonna check their fucking asses, I'm gonna find out who took those shots and I'm gonna fucking hit them.<eos> Not until the deal's done.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm on it.<eos> Man, I know you like the fucking kid.<eos> I like the kid, too, man. I mean, GI Joe over there in fucking Afghanistan.<eos> But that's not where we are, is it?<eos> You know who I am. You know what I'm about. Now, I need to be with you.

You know I can't be seen around anyone validated.<eos> Like I'm doing right now in broad fucking daylight!<eos> Now, you get everyone in check.<eos> We got too much on the line for any more bullshit!<eos> Just be careful.<eos> Fuck me!<eos> You were told to answer to nobody but me. I'm sorry...<eos> - Shut your hole!<eos> Look at me.<eos> Everything you do in this game has a consequence.

All right, break it up!<eos> Get off him!<eos> Get on the ground!<eos> Spray 'em!<eos> Stay down. Stay down.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> Fish has heart.<eos> Get on the wall.<eos> Step in.<eos> You throw any piss or shit... I'll leave you in here for the whole 30, no rec.
Thought I might find a shamrock or AB.<eos> Only a select few can wear that ink.<eos> I see.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> Need you to clear something up.<eos> Girl got shot last night out in South Bay... and someone reported you were there.<eos> Then they got it wrong.<eos> I need an alibi.<eos> Got a room at the Easy Stay Motel near downtown, till I find an apartment.<eos> Says here you checked in at 6:35 p.m.
I need an alibi.<eos> Got a room at the Easy Stay Motel near downtown, till I find an apartment.<eos> Says here you checked in at 6:35 p.m.<eos> But the shooting was after midnight.<eos> That's all I got.<eos> Paid cash with the rest of my gate money for a steak dinner at Sizzler's.<eos> Hit the bunk after that.<eos> Not much of an alibi.<eos> Not much putting me at the scene either.<eos> I figure you'd already be giving me a one year bullet for breaking parole.
When do I report in again?<eos> You don't.<eos> I check in on you.<eos> Got a cell phone yet?<eos> I wrote the number down on the form.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wood.<eos> Come with me.<eos> The man you're about to meet has the keys to this yard.
Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wood.<eos> Come with me.<eos> The man you're about to meet has the keys to this yard.<eos> Treat him with respect.<eos> I'm Bottles.<eos> Jacob.<eos> Yeah, the stock broker from Pasadena.<eos> When you come to yard, chow, you take a shit, whatever... you stick to your own race.

But I'm not taking any shit either.<eos> The only thing we got in here is our respect.<eos> The question is, what you gonna do when you're out here slumming it with the rest of us?
You gonna go around kicking it off with every buster that calls you out?<eos> I'm not looking for trouble, no. But I'm not taking any shit either.<eos> The only thing we got in here is our respect.<eos> The question is, what you gonna do when you're out here slumming it with the rest of us?<eos> Cause the safety of these numbers comes with a price.<eos> There are no free rides here.<eos> Everyone puts in work, whether cliqued up or not.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm not talking about helping us with our computer skills.<eos> You'll get your fucking hands dirty like the rest of us.

You'll get your fucking hands dirty like the rest of us.<eos> Or you can go back to seeing how that lone bullshit works out for you, money man.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Joshua made you a letter... and he's very excited for you to read it.<eos> He did it all by himself, and...<eos> I wanted to give it to you, but some guard up front took it.<eos> I know, I know, but they'll get it back to me.<eos> Good. Can't wait to read it.<eos> I think you'll like it.
Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kate?<eos> Shit.<eos> Jacob.<eos> Must feel good to be out...<eos> I would imagine.<eos> Drove by old house and... doesn't look much different, to tell you the truth.<eos> So, where are you working?
Drove by old house and... doesn't look much different, to tell you the truth.<eos> So, where are you working?<eos> I'm working in a legal firm.<eos> It's a...<eos> I'm a paralegal. Ever think about pushing your interior designing again?<eos> No.<eos> No, there's no time for that.<eos> You know, it's just between work and being a mom, it's...<eos> It's fine. It is what it is.<eos> Why'd you send him that letter?

No.<eos> No, there's no time for that.<eos> You know, it's just between work and being a mom, it's...<eos> It's fine. It is what it is.<eos> Why'd you send him that letter?<eos> Josh thought you were committing suicide.<eos> This is for you.<eos> They're signature cards to your new checking.<eos> Have them notarized, then get them back to me.<eos> You're not gonna answer my question?
There's 178 grand in there.<eos> I don't know how you got that money, and I don't care.<eos> You need to keep that.<eos> I'm not taking it.<eos> No, it's yours now.<eos> I'm not taking your gang money! Just keep it down.<eos> Don't tell me what to do. You don't get to do that.<eos> I don't hear from you for seven years.<eos> Nothing!<eos> I mean, how do you even now where I live?
I just couldn't get it to you until I was out.<eos> Okay.<eos> What is this?<eos> Is this my consolation prize?<eos> Give it to Josh then. Whatever you want...<eos> You give it to Josh.<eos> He deserves a dad.<eos> I wrote him that letter... because I won't let my stink affect him another day.<eos> He deserves better.<eos> And you deserve better.

Once that's handled, it'll be the last time you see me.<eos> Your order from the canteen?<eos> There's gonna be a balloon in your canteen.<eos> You're responsible for it.<eos> What do I do with it?<eos> Take it to yard tomorrow.<eos> How?<eos> In your fucking ass, man.<eos> Make sure you lube-up, too.<eos> You don't want this shit breaking off inside you.
What do I do with it?<eos> Take it to yard tomorrow.<eos> How?<eos> In your fucking ass, man.<eos> Make sure you lube-up, too.<eos> You don't want this shit breaking off inside you.<eos> The fuck you looking at the floor for?<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Hm?<eos> I get it. You think you're bad ass 'cause you put your tips on some fucking Toad?
The rest of us will load up in the truck.<eos> You know what's riding on this.<eos> Now, go home, lay low.<eos> Get a ride with Chopper. Sure.<eos> He's not giving up the exchange.<eos> He said he's gonna let us know an hour before, that's what he said. I tried.<eos> I done everything you asked me to do, man.<eos> Cool.<eos> Then you wear a wire.<eos> You can't ask me to wear a fucking wire! Don't come to me with that!

It's simple.<eos> What do you suggest I do, Frank, huh?<eos> You tracking my phone, right? Just do the phone thing, man.<eos> Just do the phone thing.<eos> Frank, listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna say it one time, all right?<eos> If your fucking cell phone loses its signal even for a millisecond-be quiet.<eos> Then I'm kicking your trafficking charges up to DEA.<eos> All my friends there gonna take care of you and Monica real well. Fair time.<eos> You know what that means?

All right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> What, Frank?<eos> I deliver, she comes home.<eos> I want your word.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want your word, man.<eos> I said, yeah.<eos> You got my word.
She's my fucking life, man.<eos> Ball's in your court, Frank.<eos> Catch you later, Frank.<eos> It's your turn, money man.<eos> I know you're shitting bricks right about now.<eos> Trying to rationalize the morality. What will your family think of you?<eos> How will they judge you?<eos> All of that went through my head, too, when I first broke my cherry.<eos> And then I realized none of that matters.<eos> The only thing that matters is you getting home to your family in one piece.
All right, they're popping 'em.<eos> It's time. Come here!<eos> Come here!<eos> We're doing this!<eos> All right, before he hits the tier.<eos> Get him!<eos> - The fact is we all started out as someone's little angel.<eos> And a place like this forces us to become warriors or victims.<eos> Nothing in between can exist here.<eos> And you've chosen to be a warrior.
I told you not to bring him here.<eos> I know, but he wanted to be here, so...<eos> I'm gonna stay by the car, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Look... I meant every word in that letter, so... I don't have much else to say.<eos> You know, I used to love getting your letters.<eos> I reread them like a dozen times.<eos> And then nothing from you for the past seven years.<eos> And then I get this one.<eos> Even when you knew you were getting out, you still want nothing to do with your son.
And then I get this one.<eos> Even when you knew you were getting out, you still want nothing to do with your son.<eos> It's not that.<eos> Some things just don't go back together again.<eos> They just don't. You, your mom, are on your own trajectory now.<eos> I'm on another one.<eos> What, just wasting the rest of your life, Dad?<eos> It doesn't matter what I do!<eos> Your job is to take care of yourself and your mom.<eos> Look, I get why you pushed us away.

And there will be no warning shots.<eos> You cliqued up with anyone?<eos> No.<eos> Why participate in the riot?<eos> You know why.<eos> You got your rules and we got the gang's rules.<eos> And theirs matter.<eos> Yeah, well, it cost you a year of good time on top of the new sentences and put you with the heavy hitters, so...<eos> I hope it was worth it.<eos> You know the deal, Ripper.

One, two, three!<eos> Two!<eos> Down!<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Three!<eos> Down!<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Four!<eos> Whassup?<eos> Thought you were posting up on your CI.
Three!<eos> Down!<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Four!<eos> Whassup?<eos> Thought you were posting up on your CI.<eos> - Since three a.m.<eos> Figured I'd get some chow and take a piss.<eos> Any movement? You know, I can't put my finger on it, Manny, but there's more to this Harlon guy.<eos> What you mean, like a power play?
Something about picking up guns near the Salton Sea.<eos> So at least we know the area now.<eos> Who's the tap on?<eos> Heavy hitter from the Sonora cartel.<eos> And of course ATF wants any and all intel we got.<eos> Sonora, huh?<eos> Yeah. This thing just keeps on getting bigger and bigger.<eos> Maybe it's not a bad idea to have ATF out there with us.<eos> Hey, you know what, check it out, bro.<eos> Why don't you just quarterback this one from the office?

Come on, you kidding me?<eos> That's worse, man.<eos> Sure as hell have seen my share of violence, man, but when you're in it... when you're on the other end... that's a whole different ball game, brother.

Fuck 'em.<eos> These cops... they need to understand... that we run the show.<eos> Some get it.<eos> Like Roberts.<eos> But the rest think the more they lock us down... and isolate us... it strips us of our power.<eos> They even think we closed the books.<eos> We're a dying breed.<eos> They're dead fucking wrong.<eos> We're just real selective... who we choose to call our brother.<eos> So the question is... are you ready?
Yes.<eos> What I wanted to hear.<eos> But keep your ink clean so they can't validate you.<eos> That's how we lull the enemy to sleep.<eos> I understand.<eos> You have the keys out here now.<eos> Roberts will single-cell you.<eos> Get you some privacy.<eos> Works for me.<eos> You like to read?
I'll send it over with some of my favorites.<eos> A warrior's deadliest weapon... is his mind.<eos> Welcome to the family, brother.<eos> Mr. Harlon, after serving 85 percent of your time... having a clean conduct record with no infractions... I recommend to the Parole Board your release... 30 days from today.<eos> This is your parole packet.<eos> Tells you who to report to.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Push send.<eos> And I'll be back for it in 30.<eos> You know Shotgun?
Tells you who to report to.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Push send.<eos> And I'll be back for it in 30.<eos> You know Shotgun?<eos> He just sent word to me about a heavy shipment of guns a youngster smuggled back from Afghanistan.<eos> He wants permission to go to Herman Gomez to offload them for a million five to their cartel connections.<eos> Herman got his letters?<eos> And he's out, too.<eos> Just like you'll be in 30 days.
He wants permission to go to Herman Gomez to offload them for a million five to their cartel connections.<eos> Herman got his letters?<eos> And he's out, too.<eos> Just like you'll be in 30 days.<eos> I'll get word to Herman you're handling the deal for us.<eos> And fuck our usual cut. Shotgun just bought himself a full partner on this.<eos> I'll be on parole though.<eos> The fuck's that got to do with anything?<eos> Well, 10 years... You think the fucking honor of being one of us ends at the gates? It ends when you're six feet under.<eos> Until then, you will keep earning for your brothers.
It's 10:54 now. If we can just get the exact location, we can set up on them.<eos> Here.<eos> About five miles out.<eos> Got it.<eos> Let's go, we got the coordinates!<eos> Let's ride out! All right, load up!<eos> It's half a mile up that way.<eos> All right, turn in and stop.<eos> Turn your cell back on, post up out here.<eos> Text me if you see anything.
It's half a mile up that way.<eos> All right, turn in and stop.<eos> Turn your cell back on, post up out here.<eos> Text me if you see anything.<eos> Will do.<eos> Let me see your gun.<eos> Keep driving.<eos> What!<eos> What's wrong, Money?<eos> How many guns did you tell Shotgun you had total?
Turn your cell back on, post up out here.<eos> Text me if you see anything.<eos> Will do.<eos> Let me see your gun.<eos> Keep driving.<eos> What!<eos> What's wrong, Money?<eos> How many guns did you tell Shotgun you had total?<eos> Same as I told you!<eos> You lie to me again, I'll blow your fucking head off! How many?
Keep driving.<eos> What!<eos> What's wrong, Money?<eos> How many guns did you tell Shotgun you had total?<eos> Same as I told you!<eos> You lie to me again, I'll blow your fucking head off! How many?<eos> Two.<eos> Two thousand AKs.<eos> Shotgun, right before I met you, Shotgun said that if I said anything about the extra guns, he'd green-light me, Money.<eos> You gotta believe me.
Shotgun, right before I met you, Shotgun said that if I said anything about the extra guns, he'd green-light me, Money.<eos> You gotta believe me.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Shotgun's dead, isn't he?<eos> Answer the fucking question.<eos> Second storage unit, number 246.<eos> Does Chopper or the others know?<eos> No.<eos> Shotgun and I went out alone.<eos> This is what you're gonna do.

But if I ever hear your name again... there won't be anywhere you can hide.
- Open the door and jump.<eos> Where's Howie?<eos> Dropped him off strapped quarter mile back. Watch our six.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> That's them.<eos> Looking for Shotgun?<eos> I know it was only business.<eos> Just pick a better shooter next time.<eos> Orale. You should'a seen me crack the whip on those fools.<eos> What you don't know is you made a deal with a rat.
Un millón Cinco.<eos> All right.<eos> Get down! Get down! Shoot, shoot, shoot!<eos> Hands on your back! Don't move!<eos> Drop the weapon!<eos> He's got a gun!<eos> Look away look away!<eos> Hands behind your back.<eos> We're officially validating you.<eos> Means you'll do the rest of your new life term here in the SHU- unless you wanna play ball.

Let me do my time like a man.<eos> You see, that's what I don't get.<eos> I've been around long enough to know when a con's making moves simply to survive or when it's that rare breed... the one that relishes in the power.<eos> But that's not you.<eos> Not by a long shot.<eos> Why you throwing your whole life away?<eos> Look, I don't know what they're holding over you... but I can offer you something better.<eos> Something real.<eos> No bluffs, no BS.<eos> You give me The Beast... and everyone involved... and you walk.
Nothing out there is free.<eos> Especially for a rat with a target on his back.<eos> You know, Harlon, when I walk outta here... the deal walks with me, man.<eos> Have a nice trip.<eos> All right.<eos> Good luck in here.<eos> Come on, Money.<eos> Easy.<eos> Right there.<eos> Now that we're looking eye to eye... you're gonna answer something.
Have a nice trip.<eos> All right.<eos> Good luck in here.<eos> Come on, Money.<eos> Easy.<eos> Right there.<eos> Now that we're looking eye to eye... you're gonna answer something.<eos> Shotgun's body was discovered around five o'clock which means there's no way he could've tipped off the cops with the location since Herman didn't send you the coordinates until an hour before the meet.<eos> So explain to me how three different agencies had time to set up and take everyone down.<eos> I gave you a gift... and you spit in my face.

Cuff up, Money.<eos> Okay, Money.<eos> Okay!<eos> All right, easy!<eos> Easy. Drop your radio.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy, Money.<eos> Slowly.<eos> What the fuck, Money?<eos> You knew they'd put you back here.
What the fuck, Money?<eos> You knew they'd put you back here.<eos> That's why you lead the cops to the bust... to get to me.<eos> Well played.<eos> Let's get down, Wood.<eos> Nobody's touching my family.<eos> We're gonna get a few things straight here.<eos> I'm already doing life... so I could give a shit about additional time.<eos> But I'm not sitting on Death Row waiting to be put down like some animal.<eos> So you write it up that he attacked me with the blade first.

I'm running the show now.<eos> Say it.<eos> You're running the show.
Say it.<eos> You're running the show.<eos> Pop the battery and break the SIM card.<eos> You gotta be shitting me.<eos> I still don't get this guy.<eos> But I fucking like him.<eos> Got some mail, Money.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mom told me you've gotten life without parole now.<eos> I don't think I'll ever understand why any of this has happened but I wanted you to know that I've accepted reality which is why I will do what you've asked me in your letter.

I want you to know... that I've forgiven you.
a city built on contrast.<eos> Decade old concrete buildings layered between million dollar homes.<eos> Worn out beach bums litter the same streets your cousins from Oklahoma visit every summer.<eos> Every weird dive bar you love is being pushed out by some shitbag tech company.<eos> And somewhere between the ruckus, you'll find this guy Venice's only licensed detective.<eos> You just gotta live your life.<eos> It goes by so fast. It's like a whisper.<eos> That's my boss, Steve Ford a self-appointed figurehead in the community.<eos> Takes that job very seriously.<eos> Before you know it, you're 12 years old, and then where are you?
I mean, obviously I'm not condoning sex for money.<eos> That's bad, right? We all agree, would you?<eos> Good.<eos> I really just have sex with... any old thang that comes my way.<eos> There's some limits, obviously, age 18 and below is no... no bueno, no good.<eos> Upwards, though, is where I really shine 50, 60, 80, 90, centennials...<eos> - Okay!<eos> Uh, thank you for sharing, John. - All right, you got it.<eos> - Nola? Hey, Nola?<eos> - Are you following me?
- Okay!<eos> Uh, thank you for sharing, John. - All right, you got it.<eos> - Nola? Hey, Nola?<eos> - Are you following me?<eos> No, no, no, I'm not following you.<eos> No, no, don't mace me!<eos> I'm not a stalker.<eos> I I am technically following you, but not in a stalker way just as a professional... strictly professional.<eos> Look, your brothers hired my boss to find you and that's where I come in.<eos> They want you to come home, okay, they miss you.
No, no, no, I'm not following you.<eos> No, no, don't mace me!<eos> I'm not a stalker.<eos> I I am technically following you, but not in a stalker way just as a professional... strictly professional.<eos> Look, your brothers hired my boss to find you and that's where I come in.<eos> They want you to come home, okay, they miss you.<eos> I could drive you, at least to my boss' house.<eos> In a professional way not as a maniac or a pervert, on either parts.<eos> Yeah, uh, I'll let her know.<eos> All right, so you'll be safe there till tomorrow and then in the morning we can figure out how best to deal with your brothers.
All right, well, pleasure to meet you. - You, too.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thanks for the ride.<eos> - No problem, just doing my job.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Steve's a good guy.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Stay down!<eos> You're gonna wish you never touched her!
- Goodbye.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Steve's a good guy.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Stay down!<eos> You're gonna wish you never touched her!<eos> Stop it, you're gonna kill him!<eos> Nola, take your ass in the goddamn room and don't you come out of there!<eos> Listen, listen, let's talk about this.<eos> You're about to go through a Samoan storm.
We told you to find her, not fuck her.<eos> - She's our sister, you son of a bitch.<eos> You're dead, Steve!<eos> Run, Steve, run!<eos> Okay, hands, pal!<eos> Let me see your hands!<eos> I said hands, now, get them up!<eos> Aw, Jesus.<eos> Oh, Bill, it's you. Jesus, how you doing, man?<eos> Steve, what the hell are you doing out here?
Let me see your hands!<eos> I said hands, now, get them up!<eos> Aw, Jesus.<eos> Oh, Bill, it's you. Jesus, how you doing, man?<eos> Steve, what the hell are you doing out here?<eos> Aren't you tired of this Peter Pan bullshit?<eos> This is no kind of life, you're an old man.<eos> Why don't you just meet somebody your own age and make a life, for God sakes?<eos> - I will.<eos> - You know, someday, Steve one of these guys is gonna catch you and what are you gonna do then?
- Come on, let's go, let's go.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Steve, you can't have a gun in the bar!<eos> You motherfucker!<eos> Let's go, go, go!<eos> Go, go, go, go!<eos> Tino, Tino. Let me in!<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> - Yo, open up, man. Come on.<eos> - You're naked. - What?
- Let me in, man, all right!<eos> - Cover that dick, I got pizza here.<eos> - All right, yeah.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Orale. - Pull, fucker!<eos> I'm not going in there.<eos> That's Spyder's place.<eos> My car's in that guy's garage, Steve, you gotta get it for me.<eos> I'm not a repo man, okay, I'm a fucking detective.<eos> You promised, Steve.
You know a little hammer, a little glass.<eos> Tires still look fantastic.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Dave Jones, and no, not the lead singer of The Monkees.<eos> This guy's a local legend and Steve's longtime best pal.<eos> His claim to fame was surfing the pier naked for 12 hours straight on acid.<eos> Nowadays he's lost a lot of that mojo mainly due to a pretty nasty divorce.<eos> Hey, Dave.<eos> Did you start working at Tino's Pizza?

She wants full assets and alimony, too.<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> You're gonna be all right.<eos> We'll figure something out.<eos> - Sun's gonna be up soon.<eos> - Yeah, it is.<eos> - Should probably get some sleep.<eos> - I just finished your new board.<eos> This has been fun, but I gotta go pick up my dog.<eos> Why don't you just let her have Buddy?
You're gonna be all right.<eos> Buddy Ford, 49 years old in dog years and 100 percent Parson Russell Terrier.<eos> Man, does Steve love that dog.<eos> Uncle Steve.<eos> Hi, Taylor.<eos> What are you studying?<eos> - Chemistry.<eos> - Want some help with that?<eos> A.P. Chemistry.<eos> Will you bring Buddy back later tonight?

Get out, pal.<eos> Large coffee.<eos> You're not in your office.<eos> - Lew the Jew.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, okay I know how that sounds.<eos> It's not offensive, everyone calls him that.<eos> I mean, he calls himself, "Lew the Jew."<eos> - No, I'm not in my office.<eos> - I went by your office.<eos> - And you didn't find me there?
- Steve, I want to hire you.<eos> He's a savvy businessman, and a little miserly... - ...but not in a Jewish way, in a normal way.<eos> - ...girl in the picture...<eos> Hey, hey, Steve, that's a lot of money for just a few pictures, you know? Yeah.<eos> Could've cost you a lot more money.<eos> Why are we arguing?<eos> I'll see you later, Lew.<eos> Let's go, Buddy.<eos> Some son of a bitch graffiti punk has been spray-painting the walls of my apartment buildings.<eos> I could certainly help you with that. I know many of the taggers in the neighborhood, the only problem is, you still owe me money.
I could certainly help you with that. I know many of the taggers in the neighborhood, the only problem is, you still owe me money.<eos> Aw, Steve, I can't pay you for that. You understand, it's the principle of the thing.<eos> We're getting the band back together, bro!<eos> - Great! Yeah!<eos> Taylor Swift saved the music industry!<eos> - Who the hell is that?<eos> I'll sell you the house back.<eos> - My parent's house?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You'll sell it back to me?
Taylor Swift saved the music industry!<eos> - Who the hell is that?<eos> I'll sell you the house back.<eos> - My parent's house?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You'll sell it back to me?<eos> At the same price they sold it to you for?<eos> Come on, Stevie, you're killing me, man.<eos> I mean, this is Silicon Beach now.<eos> You realize what I could get for that house?
At the same price they sold it to you for?<eos> Come on, Stevie, you're killing me, man.<eos> I mean, this is Silicon Beach now.<eos> You realize what I could get for that house?<eos> No deal.<eos> Ten percent more.<eos> I can see this is really important to you, Lew.<eos> What gave it away?<eos> - I want it in writing.<eos> - You're killin' me.
Holy Christ.<eos> See what I mean?<eos> - I like it.<eos> - You could see how I might not.<eos> He's really captured your essence.<eos> - Why don't you just paint over it?<eos> - I painted over it four times.<eos> You should have seen the other shit, it was filthier than this.<eos> - I can't imagine anything filthier than this.<eos> - Just get it done, Steve if you want your parent's house back.
- How about this?<eos> - Cash only, no checks.<eos> And that's on sale.<eos> Great, thanks.<eos> She can take my shop, but I'm not leaving her anything.<eos> - I'm letting it go.<eos> You do that, pal, let it all go.<eos> Now, normally by this time, Steve's already had about eight cups of coffee... and he doesn't really handle the caffeine all that well.<eos> So, a little secret between you and I is I switched the brew in our office with decaf, you know, to take the edge off.<eos> John. Have you seen a picture around here, a picture of my house?

Have you seen a picture around here, a picture of my house?<eos> - Wow, this is good coffee.<eos> - Uh the Samoans called looking for you.<eos> I said that you were very sorry.
- Great.<eos> Lew the Jew, all his apartment buildings, you're getting graffiti all over the place.<eos> - There's a month of my life down the drain.<eos> - The house, it was on my... it was right...<eos> - Sorry, this is it right here.<eos> Oh, well, let's see what this photo is all about.<eos> This is me as a kid. Look, seven years old right there.<eos> I'm holding the dog.<eos> - That's you?<eos> You're such a fat kid.

- No, not personally...<eos> - Then you should find some, how about that?<eos> Yeah, sure, definitely, I'll find some graffiti artists.<eos> - You should get more of this coffee, too.<eos> - Yep, definitely.<eos> Steve...<eos> I need you.<eos> I lost a lot of this weight right away.<eos> Come on, Buddy.<eos> You also lost a lot of that hair right away, too.
Steve...<eos> I need you.<eos> I lost a lot of this weight right away.<eos> Come on, Buddy.<eos> You also lost a lot of that hair right away, too.<eos> I need your help. - All right, when?<eos> - Right now.<eos> - Right now?<eos> - Right now.<eos> You know why.
I need your help. - All right, when?<eos> - Right now.<eos> - Right now?<eos> - Right now.<eos> You know why.<eos> I'm desperate.<eos> All right, Buddy, in the back, up we go.<eos> - Right now, huh?<eos> Stay low, Buddy.<eos> Put this in your ear, you'll be able to hear me talking to you the whole time.

- May I?<eos> - Hi, Dave.<eos> Anne.<eos> You need to sign the divorce papers, Dave.<eos> Don't sign anything.<eos> Repeat, do not sign anything, Dave.<eos> I'll give you the surf shop, you can have it.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Get up and walk away.<eos> You won't reconsider?
Repeat, do not sign anything, Dave.<eos> I'll give you the surf shop, you can have it.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Get up and walk away.<eos> You won't reconsider?<eos> It's done.<eos> Dave, it's done!<eos> Careful, buddy.<eos> I'm going to sign these papers because I've learned how to let go.<eos> And if you think you deserve everything I've ever worked for then I want you to have it, including the surf shop.
Careful, buddy.<eos> I'm going to sign these papers because I've learned how to let go.<eos> And if you think you deserve everything I've ever worked for then I want you to have it, including the surf shop.<eos> No, no, Dave.<eos> Don't sign anything, stop, stop.<eos> I told him.<eos> I think I fucked up.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> Come on, Buddy.<eos> You're gonna be spending some time with Taylor.
How ya doin'?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> How are you?<eos> You know that I think of you as a son.<eos> I did not know that, but thank you.<eos> I guess I feel like, sometimes I think of you as a father in a way...<eos> - ...a very intimidating father.<eos> - I'm gonna need your help, John.<eos> Okay, what, like out in the field?<eos> You're gonna go out there and you're gonna find out whoever's painting these murals... - ...on Lew the Jew's walls.
The guy doesn't leave a signature.<eos> Maybe he's not a tagger, maybe this guy's a trained artist.<eos> - Okay, yeah, sure, yeah, that fits.<eos> - And, John wear extra underpants.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Why do I have to wear extra underpants?<eos> That's the discipline.<eos> I'm sorry, sorry, it's part of being a detective to wear multiple pairs of underwear?<eos> Do you have multiple pairs of underwear on right now?
- Uncle Steve.<eos> - I want you right now.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Oh, that's the maid, she slipped and fell.<eos> We've been robbed, they took everything!<eos> You got what?<eos> They took everything, the TV, the stereo, Taylor's Xbox.<eos> I can't believe it, they took Buddy!<eos> Try to stay calm and wait for the cops.<eos> - Well, where are you going?
I've seen them hanging out down by the boardwalk.<eos> - You're a good neighbor.<eos> - Fuck you, Steve.<eos> Hey, dickhead, can I hit that?<eos> What'd you call us?<eos> Actually, what I meant to say was dickheads.<eos> Dickhead one, dickhead two.<eos> - Hey, fuck you, man!<eos> - Hey, what's your problem, bro!<eos> - You broke my nose, fag!
- I'm not giving you the dog back! - Shut up.<eos> - It's the only thing I want.<eos> Okay then, ese.<eos> You can have the dog back.<eos> It's only gonna cost you $3,000.<eos> - $3,000?<eos> - $4,000.<eos> - You just said, $3,000.<eos> - You just fucked up my window.<eos> - You gave that dog to me.
That's my dog, Spyder.<eos> Ah, Yuri, Venice's local loan shark and ruthless son of a bitch.<eos> Everybody knows, he is the last person you want to borrow money from.<eos> He's also the last person you want to see on a beach wearing a bikini.<eos> I love this country.<eos> He only gives you a day to pay him back.<eos> What kind of person borrows money from a guy who only gives you a day to pay him back?<eos> How's it going, Yuri?<eos> Eh, it takes patience.<eos> So, how much money you looking for?

Very formal.<eos> Listen, Stevie, I like you, you're funny.<eos> I loan you money but you pay me back or you have scrotum bowtie.
I loan you money but you pay me back or you have scrotum bowtie.<eos> "Ponimayu?"<eos> - Scrotum Bowtie.<eos> - Good luck. - Thank you.<eos> See you soon.<eos> So, Steve I just got off the phone with my brokers and it turns out that the Chinese group that's interested in buying my apartment complex is getting a little skittish...<eos> - Yeah the graffiti situation is getting skittishy.<eos> They're cutting their offer by half, Steve.<eos> So, here's the thing, okay?<eos> You find this graffiti kid in the next two days and you guarantee me no graffiti through the end of escrow and I will sell you this house for what I paid for it.

Bad news, fucker.<eos> Your dog's gone.<eos> Gone?<eos> How gone?<eos> All the way gone.<eos> Lupe, that bitch, took him.<eos> What are you talking about. You just took my money!<eos> This was for the car, the window and the garage.<eos> I was gonna throw the little dog in for free.<eos> You think I'm some kind of fucking idiot?

Bro?<eos> Don't think I don't have fucking nice people in my house! - You really are crazy.<eos> - They've been to places that you've never been to!
- Hey, that's Taylor's TV, bro.<eos> - What about Taylor?<eos> - What about Taylor!<eos> That's your little niece's TV, bro.<eos> Take a breath, bro.<eos> Listen, that bitch Lupe took your dog, hm?<eos> And a briefcase filled with my cocaine.<eos> You find her, you get my shit, I'll give you your money back.<eos> How about this?<eos> How about I find your girl and your briefcase full of cocaine and you pay me triple the money.
Oh, he spit that pit on your floor.<eos> Uh, you know what that is legitimately all I needed to know, so all right, I'm gonna let you keep that and thank you so much for your time.<eos> You can actually have the beer, that's for you, my tip.<eos> - Be careful!<eos> - She plays mind games.<eos> - Takes hours to respond to texts. - Oh, hello.<eos> One of the most annoying things is that she'll make plans and then cancel them, day of.<eos> She'll invite you over to watch a movie and then just wanna watch a movie! - Okay.<eos> Okay, I really, I gotta get going. - Oh, and she's a Capricorn.<eos> Yo, if you find her tell her Rigaberto is thinking about her.

Good day, gentlemen.<eos> So, after my stellar detective work, I pointed Steve in the direction of the Hollywood Premiere Motel where Consuela was known to frequent.<eos> Damn!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hey, baby, I'm Mocha.<eos> You looking for a date?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> What... you some kind of fag or something, sweetie?<eos> What would... how...<eos> Mocha maybe you could help me.

What kind of Annie Oakley bullshit is that?<eos> Some kind of bullshit Knott's Berry Farm picture. I don't know.<eos> Well, that one's Lupe, I've seen her.<eos> Room 216.<eos> You didn't see a little dog, too, did you?<eos> Oh, that dog's got some bowel problems.<eos> - He doesn't have any bowel problems.<eos> - He shits fuckin' everywhere!<eos> - It's a nervous disorder.<eos> Now, if you change your mind...
- Yeah, hi.<eos> - I'm John, my name's John.<eos> - I know, we've met.<eos> I just said your name.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry, I remember you, I'm just...<eos> I'm not used to people remembering me.<eos> Well, how could I forget a guy who followed me down a dark alley?<eos> I should have finished the job, killed you there.<eos> Sorry, I wouldn't kill you.<eos> By the way, were you just talking to yourself?
- Could be "Salvatoré", I don't really know.<eos> - I love him.<eos> You know him?<eos> Yeah, of course, he's like the Banksy of Venice.<eos> - I would love to see what he looks like.<eos> - You and me both.<eos> - Do you want some company?<eos> Yes, but you know it's just I mean, it's a stakeout, it's sitting in a car.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> You have a very low bar for a fun evening.
Then I guess I'd marry Ellen just because of the sense of humor, you gotta want that in a wife.<eos> And she's got an endless supply of sneakers and suits.<eos> - That's true.<eos> - And will dance the day away.<eos> And then, I guess, I'd have to kill Kelly.<eos> Sweet, sweet Ripa.<eos> Only because that's the nature of the game, and someone's gotta die.<eos> It would probably scar me for life, it would ruin my marriage with Ellen, so...<eos> That's fair.<eos> It's so crazy to me that you, uh, that you know Salvatore Lopez, that's...

It's very sensual.<eos> - And the way the veins follow your eyes. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - And the scrotal shading.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> You know, you're kind of cute.
Well, I've been told I'm a bit of a young Roger Daltrey if he spent a lot of time with computers.<eos> - Ooh, it's my little noodle.<eos> Ladies.<eos> I like watching you walk away.<eos> Buddy!<eos> Aw, man, come on.<eos> There you go.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> Aw, come here, pal... take a little rest.<eos> What do you think you're doing in my girl Lupe's room?
He took good care of me.<eos> Loved me for what I was.<eos> Good man like that's hard to find.<eos> Don't I know it, girl.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> Oh, I killed him.<eos> There... what do you think, sugar?<eos> - I feel really special.<eos> - Yeah, I knew you would.<eos> You know what I think is next?
We gonna have to give you a shave, baby.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Come on, sweetness, let's move little doggie to the bathroom before it shits all over the bed.<eos> Gonna have some fun... mm-mm-mm.<eos> Now, don't be wiggling around on me 'cause I'd hate to cut off what little you got down there, baby.<eos> Here you go, Buddy.<eos> Here boy, here you go, pal, come here.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Get your ass back here now!<eos> You broke my nose!
Come back here!<eos> Come back here, motherfucker!<eos> Let's get him!<eos> Get that motherfucker!<eos> Come on, girls!<eos> Let's get him! Get him!<eos> We're gonna kick your ass! Open that car!<eos> He was kinda cute.<eos> - Hey, fellas, how you doing?<eos> You borrow money, you pay money back.

Brings out the color in your eyes.<eos> - So, a day? - One day.<eos> All right.<eos> Remind him of the due date, huh?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's you, Lew, I just don't know what happened to you.<eos> I'm running out of time, okay?<eos> The Chinese are coming to visit the building tomorrow.<eos> It's a Lucha Libre wrestler and I think he's tea-bagging you, Lew.<eos> I'm gonna lose the sale, okay? Everything I worked for, for fuck's sake!<eos> You said you were gonna take care of this!

You want me to lend you... fuck you!<eos> And what happened to you?<eos> You were supposed to take care of this.<eos> Yeah, I know, I'm sorry, I got, uh... distracted.<eos> - Just go find the graffiti artist.<eos> - It's very creative.<eos> I've never even imagined tea-bagging someone like that.<eos> I'll...<eos> Hey, Dave.<eos> You're drinking alone and the sun's still up.
- It's very creative.<eos> I've never even imagined tea-bagging someone like that.<eos> I'll...<eos> Hey, Dave.<eos> You're drinking alone and the sun's still up.<eos> I've been evicted from my own house.<eos> Ah, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> You know I'm there for you.<eos> I know.<eos> Promise me that you'll let me be there.
I'll let you be there.<eos> Listen, I count on you to be the ballast in my life.<eos> I need you to turn this thing around.<eos> I'm there for you.<eos> So, about that five grand plus interest I need, so Yuri doesn't kill me.<eos> From the closing sale at the shop.<eos> - Mi dinero es su dinero.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Really, thank you.<eos> - So, you are learning to let go?
Thanks, man.<eos> Really, thank you.<eos> - So, you are learning to let go?<eos> - I'm letting go, all right.<eos> Here crash at my place.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Hey, Yuri.<eos> Thank you very much, very much.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You're a man of your word, huh?
Wait for it.<eos> Yes, I got him!<eos> I got Salvatore. - What?<eos> - Yeah, I was looking right at him.<eos> Uh... and... just... I don't know if this changes anything, but he's not Latino.<eos> Well, 'cause Salvatore Lopez, right? - But he's not, he's black.<eos> - All right, I'll see you in a little bit.<eos> No, that doesn't make me a racist, I just thought you might I'll be here.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You must be Salvatore.
Jesus.<eos> You must be Salvatore.<eos> So?<eos> How much does this one go for?<eos> $10,000.<eos> I'll tell you what, I'll give you five dollars for this and keep you from going to jail.<eos> Man, I think you should get the fuck out of here.<eos> What's that? What's that?<eos> Hold still, jerkoff.<eos> You painted the top of my head blue. You remember?

- You and your dog's time is running out.<eos> - You didn't find Lupe yet, did you?<eos> You're the one that's supposed to be looking.<eos> I want my shit back!<eos> I want my dog back.<eos> Whoa, jeez.<eos> - Great.<eos> - You got 24 hours, Holmes.<eos> - I'm gonna come find you.<eos> You probably don't care but, um you're saying, "24," but your hands are actually saying, "42."
Whoa, jeez.<eos> - Great.<eos> - You got 24 hours, Holmes.<eos> - I'm gonna come find you.<eos> You probably don't care but, um you're saying, "24," but your hands are actually saying, "42."<eos> I know when I do my gang gestures, I like to practice in the mirror.<eos> See this watch? This watch is shit.<eos> Fuck your watch!<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> You might want to get out of the house once in a while.
You have a good day, all right?<eos> You're short. - What?<eos> - You're short.<eos> That's all Prince gave me for that stuff.<eos> I swear.<eos> Oscar, I would never lie to you.<eos> I gotta get back to Spyder's before he suspects anything.<eos> What happens if Spyder finds out?<eos> Fuck Spyder.<eos> - Where are you taking my dog?
- What?<eos> - Just stay here.<eos> Pinche loco.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Fuck Oscar and fuck Spyder.<eos> Bonus!<eos> - What gives? - Some "just in case" stuff.<eos> I guess.<eos> Wow, where'd you get this? Some drug lord? Nah.<eos> You remember Dana Kaminski?
- Knuckle duster?<eos> - Ninja throwing star?<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> What else have I got to do?<eos> I'm with you.<eos> To the hounds.<eos> Nice.<eos> - You got a flat tire.<eos> - What?<eos> Are you kidding me?
- Well, fix the fucking thing.<eos> - Gigi don't fix no tires.<eos> Shit.<eos> Fix the fucking thing or we're gonna be late.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Hurry up, okay?<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Bitch.<eos> - What?<eos> - You heard me.
- Show me the stuff.<eos> - Just open the case. - Show us the stuff.<eos> - Open the case.<eos> - Show us the fucking stuff!<eos> - Motherfucker, open the motherfucking case.<eos> - Show us the motherfucking stuff! - Open the motherfucking case, Steve!<eos> - What are... what are you doing?<eos> - Kill these motherfuckers.<eos> Shit!<eos> Now the thing you need to do is sit there real quiet and just sit back.
- Open the case.<eos> - Show us the fucking stuff!<eos> - Motherfucker, open the motherfucking case.<eos> - Show us the motherfucking stuff! - Open the motherfucking case, Steve!<eos> - What are... what are you doing?<eos> - Kill these motherfuckers.<eos> Shit!<eos> Now the thing you need to do is sit there real quiet and just sit back.<eos> I'm just gonna hold this up to your neck. Okay, be very cool.<eos> We're gonna stand up, you ready?
- Go fuck yourself!<eos> No, I will not go fuck myself, Oscar.<eos> Just tell Spyder that I got his coke and I want my dog and my money, all right?<eos> So I'll be over there tonight.<eos> Well, that was easy.<eos> Yeah, easy getting in, not so easy getting out.<eos> - It sure smells like a set-up.<eos> - You got a plan?<eos> Of course, I got a plan.<eos> You see what's happening here, don't you?
You see what's happening here, don't you?<eos> For the first time in your life, Katey and Taylor you're putting them and their needs before your own.<eos> Now me, I'm doing the totally opposite thing.<eos> I'm putting my needs before anyone else's for the first time in my life.<eos> I've become you, and you've become me.<eos> - It's a little right on the nose, isn't it?<eos> - Sure, but I didn't have much time with it.<eos> Great news! Jesus!<eos> It's me, it's okay.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here, John?
- Why didn't you just beat the shit out of him?<eos> - Momma likes him.<eos> - You met Nola's mom?<eos> Yeah, yeah, uh, just yesterday, actually... a very lovely lunch.<eos> Joan... is a wonderful cook.<eos> And it turns out, we both have a passion for vintage cinema, so...<eos> - So we're all good here?<eos> - Yeah, we're cool.<eos> - And?<eos> We owe you, Steve and if there's anything you need, you could come see us.
Keep your head down.<eos> Picked the right man for the job.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> - What the fuck, Holmes?<eos> - It's that Muffin motherfucker, man!<eos> He's back, took a shot at me!<eos> Watch the windows, I'll find that muffinfucker!<eos> Drop the gun.<eos> Does Spyder know you and Lupe stole all the drugs?<eos> And you've been fucking her?
- What the fuck are you doing?<eos> I'm completely out of control.<eos> All right, that's our guy.<eos> Is that for me?<eos> I got it, I got it.<eos> Dude... okay.<eos> Hang on to that.<eos> There he is, come here.<eos> I missed you so much!<eos> You been feeding my dog?
Was it unorthodox in execution? Sure.<eos> Should he see someone about multiple concussions in a span of 24 hours?<eos> Definitely.<eos> Could he benefit from maybe a therapist to help him sort out some of his many issues?<eos> That's not for me to say.<eos> The main thing is Steve got his dog back.<eos> Lew the Jew made good on his deal and me, I got the girl.<eos> Never thought I'd get to say that.<eos> She's all yours.<eos> You, uh, take good care of her, huh?
She's all yours.<eos> You, uh, take good care of her, huh?<eos> - I will, Lew.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> Do you like your new room?<eos> My new room is pretty amazing.<eos> Have a good time today.<eos> Thought you might want that.
Hot moo!<eos> I'll take a steak.<eos> Either way, everyone is happy.<eos> Case closed.<eos> - Steve, it's me, it's John.<eos> - I can't hear you very well.<eos> - Here, I got you.<eos> It's John.<eos> Yeah, uh, look, I know everyone is probably looking forward to my world-famous pasta salad but I won't be able to make it.<eos> So I invite you to my party, and you're not gonna bring anything?
- Here, I got you.<eos> It's John.<eos> Yeah, uh, look, I know everyone is probably looking forward to my world-famous pasta salad but I won't be able to make it.<eos> So I invite you to my party, and you're not gonna bring anything?<eos> I won't be able to attend the barbeque...<eos> pasta salad's already made.<eos> Okay, no worries, pal, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Hello?<eos> I believe he hung up.<eos> That's terrible, because if he's not gonna come to us, now we gotta go to him which means you need to tell us where he is.
This pistol is loaded.<eos> My God.<eos> Perhaps by ship and by carriage. Hm?<eos> Come here.<eos> Where's your propriety, Brace?<eos> Servant and master?<eos> Get off me.<eos> - Begging your pardon, sir.<eos> - What, why?<eos> Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?

Not tea, brandy.<eos> Two glasses.<eos> Sir?<eos> Fetch two glasses.<eos> They should have invited you.<eos> To the wake, at least.<eos> Serving stew in the backroom, to hell with that.<eos> In all of this dirty city, there is no-one that I can trust, do you understand?<eos> Apart from you.<eos> You can spare me the old maiden splutter, Brace.

I'd say, "Come on, come in.<eos> Before the tide gets your shoes."<eos> And he would light these fires on the shore, call out your name and talk to you.<eos> Is that grief, James?<eos> Is what grief?<eos> And all the while, these gulls hovered around picking at him.<eos> Gulls only come if there is meat.<eos> Oh, aye, meat there was.<eos> Men of affairs, they call themselves.<eos> Don't you want to know what it is they wanted, these gulls?
A base of land called Nootka Sound.<eos> Nootka was my mother's tribe.<eos> Your mother came from Naples.<eos> He bought some land and he bought a wife.<eos> And he bought them both for gunpowder.<eos> He told me never to speak to you of buying her.<eos> And yet he told me everything.<eos> When?<eos> When he lit his fires on the foreshore.<eos> Nothing you could tell me about that man would surprise me.
When?<eos> When he lit his fires on the foreshore.<eos> Nothing you could tell me about that man would surprise me.<eos> He was half human at the end and he would squat right here and make deals with ghosts in the flames.<eos> And he would speak in a language that was like... It was like ravens fighting.<eos> And he would talk to you, James.<eos> And he would talk to Anna.<eos> Salish.<eos> My mother's name was Salish.<eos> You know things only he and I knew.

If you're looking for money, those accounts are ten years old.<eos> Where are my father's inventories and his shipping logs?<eos> He burnt them all.<eos> The only reason these accounts survived was because I hid them in case the taxman came knocking.<eos> That was delivered at 6 AM this morning by a servant of Mr. Robert Thoyt.<eos> Thoyt has been trying to buy the Delaney Shipping Company from your father for three years.<eos> Each time, your da would go into the street, scoop up some horse shite and package it up by way of reply.<eos> I imagine the envelope contains a financial offer.<eos> I imagine it does.<eos> Do you have any horse shit on you?

Where did you get the key?<eos> This key?<eos> This is my father's key.<eos> Horace Delaney. Mmm?<eos> Shit.<eos> Yes, shit.<eos> Your father stopped coming.<eos> It was empty.<eos> It was wasted, so close to the docks.<eos> You want tea?

People who do not know me soon come to understand that I do not have any sense.<eos> Now, please do not misunderstand the situation.<eos> You send me 12 men, I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.<eos> Two hours.<eos> You...<eos> I remember you.<eos> I remember you.<eos> Heard the stories.<eos> If I give you a girl, I will never see her again.<eos> You heard right.
I remember you.<eos> I remember you.<eos> Heard the stories.<eos> If I give you a girl, I will never see her again.<eos> You heard right.<eos> Be punctual.<eos> - They've brought the carriage up.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> You're not imploring him to relinquish his deed, you're insisting that, for his own welfare, he submit his claim to you.

The offer of ã50 should be conditional on him leaving England.<eos> Why?<eos> Because if he does not leave England, I will kill him.<eos> Why?<eos> That is a very good question.<eos> Why would I feel that way about him, after meeting him only once?<eos> The son of the same father as the woman I love...<eos> Why does a soldier know that a nigger bowing low has a dagger in his shoe and is reaching for it?<eos> Delaney is nothing more than a nigger now.<eos> You know that, don't you?

You get me an address, and I will get you payment in the form of a banker's draft.<eos> - How much?<eos> - Enough.<eos> Good day.<eos> You don't even ask how your own blood fares.<eos> If you don't approve of me steadying my nerves with Madeira, then perhaps you should consult the directory of the Royal College of Physicians, see you know many others of them will agree to carry out this kind of work.<eos> I intend to mix the contents of his stomach with potassium oxide, calcium oxide and nitric acid.<eos> I'll know in 20 minutes.<eos> Come back when the church bell chimes.<eos> You did this.

Apparently, they're happy to deal with the devil and leave us penniless.<eos> The letter, it seemed, did no good.<eos> He was never one to be told.<eos> Well, we have legal rights, and it's time that savage was made aware.<eos> - I know he's your brother but...<eos> - Half-brother.<eos> He leaves me no choice.<eos> - I'm going out.<eos> - Good.<eos> I'm tired of these empty threats you keep bandying around.

Please.<eos> The balance of your father's mind was, well, unstable... but you have no such excuse.<eos> Now, why don't you just open the fucking envelope?<eos> Good day.<eos> The son is as unstable as the father.<eos> Perhaps the rumours about him are true.<eos> I'd hoped to settle this matter in a modern way, but that's not going to be possible.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> Dear James, the letter I sent to you this morning was written under the supervision of my husband, to whom I am happily married.<eos> It is more than ten years since you went away, and at the time I was grateful that you had decided to leave England, for both of our sakes.
James Keziah Delaney.<eos> Dear Lord Almighty, is that your brother? !<eos> Your father was poisoned.<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure is that I still love you.<eos> 'Now he is returned 'and Delaney's will leaves him everything, including Nootka.'<eos> Britain and the United States are currently at war.<eos> Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I can give you whatever you like - boys, girls.

Only Delaney's death will render it obsolete.<eos> This is going to bring the house down around it.<eos> Damn thing!<eos> Beg your pardon.<eos> So what's this for?<eos> To keep things safe.<eos> What things?<eos> And Brace?<eos> Go to hell!<eos> You marched with Tremain.
Either in Africa or on the journey back to London.<eos> One of their agents approached him, briefed him, gave him money and secured his services.<eos> Who, who did, sir?<eos> The fucking Americans!<eos> Atticus!<eos> James Delaney.<eos> Well, look at you.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Give me back my horse.<eos> What's the biggest thing you saw?

Well, about a year ago, a gentleman comes in, sat right there where you are now, and says, "How about old Horace Delaney,"<eos> "the mad bastard lighting fires by the river?"<eos> "Say he falls in, the current takes him, how about that?"<eos> So I says to the gentleman...<eos> "I sailed with old Horace all around the world."<eos> See?<eos> So I said, "You go or I'll slit your gizzard"<eos> "and drop you in the current you had planned with Captain Delaney."<eos> And who was this gentleman?<eos> What was the smallest thing you saw?
I'd say he wasn't East India.<eos> More from up Leadenhall.<eos> I could tell by the cut of his jib.<eos> So, how much will you give me for not killing your father?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Well, £15... £15.<eos> ..and the return of your horse.<eos> I will give you £15, minus the heels on my boots... and I will need your eyes and ears from now on as well.<eos> Yeah, well, the enemies you're stirring up, James, you'll be needing them, my boy.
Your Highness, they will run out of powder.<eos> And I have run out of fucking patience.<eos> Tell the Admiralty, although the gossips say that all Prinny wants is flowers and waltzes, in truth, Prinny also demands the American ships be sunk, the survivors hanged, the bodies of the drowned nailed to the church walls of Ireland<eos> Do you want me to write this down?<eos> YES!<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> It's, um, from the East India.<eos> Fuck them as well.<eos> I intend to.<eos> Who are you?
No, just Winter.<eos> Just Winter.<eos> I live with the whores, but I'm a virgin.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> To save your life.<eos> Mistress Helga gave information to a man with a silver tooth.<eos> I spy on her.<eos> From the conversation, he meant to do you harm, and the mistress knew it.<eos> She wants you dead, so she can have her rooms back.<eos> How old are you?
Are you tricking me?<eos> No.<eos> They say you was in Africa.<eos> What is it like?<eos> Is everybody naked?<eos> I want to go to America.<eos> Promise to take me to America one day.<eos> New York or Boston?<eos> The current here heads for Gravesend.<eos> You know navigation.
Stay.<eos> The very same smell.<eos> Same smell as what?<eos> As your father's clothes when he would go dancing on the foreshore and light his fires.<eos> Brace, where did my father keep his most important things?<eos> What is it you're looking for?<eos> The Nootka Sound treaty.<eos> It may be written on deerskin.<eos> So what you're saying is...<eos> "Brace, do you have any idea where I can find ma ain death warrant?"
Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.<eos> Prayer beads, not enough to get you to heaven.<eos> And hashish, enough to ease my grieving when the East India Company slit your throat, which, of course, they will.<eos> You have appointments today.<eos> Breakfast will be out in half an hour... if you can contrive to stay alive that long.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was turning out to be a long, drawn-out process.<eos> I'd benefit from a period of reflection.<eos> Do you have a girl here called Winter?

I'll deal first... with the beneficiaries and then with the division straight after.<eos> I said straight after!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Let them get on with it.<eos> We've waited long enough.<eos> Mr Delaney died a widower.<eos> He is survived by two children, both present at this division.<eos> Of his daughter, Zilpha Annabel Delaney, now Zilpha Annabel Geary, there is no mention in this last will and testament.<eos> To his son, James Keziah Delaney, is left the only existing assets of the Delaney estate, including the Nootka trading post and landing ground on the Pacific north-west coast of the Americas, in what was formerly Spanish America.<eos> Whatever you have, you will sell...
An event which may be imminent.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please, welcome to London violin virtuoso Nicolas Mori.<eos> Tonight, composer Ludwig van Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.<eos> James, please, don't.<eos> What?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.<eos> Do you know, this is so old, I could even laugh at you?<eos> And yet you came outside to see me.<eos> Because, otherwise, you would've come to me and made very loud declarations.

In the jungle, no.<eos> You used to straighten your skirt and march away like nothing had ever happened.<eos> Who marched away?<eos> And thank God you did.<eos> God?<eos> This is very simple, James. Take away a little ancient history.<eos> You live in the East, I live in the West..<eos> There are no practical difficulties.<eos> Apart from that great big river that connects us.<eos> Did you really eat flesh?

- You tell Carlsbad my name.<eos> - And who's Carlsbad?<eos> Carlsbad is the head of the American Society of Secret Correspondence in London.<eos> At all times your life is in our hands.<eos> As is your name in mine.<eos> Carlsbad.<eos> If they invited us both, then they probably know.<eos> Who knows?<eos> I challenge James Delaney to a duel, to the death.<eos> Do you accept?
Can we please get on with it?<eos> This fog is pestilential.<eos> Where is your second?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> The code requires you have a second.<eos> I don't have one.<eos> Let's just say this woman is yours and she is late.<eos> Could you not find a boat like a normal person?<eos> I was bored and I've never seen a man shot before.<eos> Why don't you go and stand over there by the fire and keep warm?
So, how did it resolve itself?<eos> Did you both see sense?<eos> No.<eos> I shot him.<eos> Between the eyes.<eos> And a host of devils flew out of the hole in his head and down the river.<eos> In that event, it would be potatoes, wouldn't it?<eos> Simple sustenance.<eos> Life goes on.<eos> Before you drink any more, could you tell me what happened?
The Company can cause me a lot of difficulties, but only the King can have me hanged.<eos> The Crown will choose to make a deal.<eos> So I will not hang.<eos> Look, I'm very happy to admit that I don't want James Delaney to die.<eos> But can you also admit that you don't want James Delaney to die?<eos> You'll get me my trunk today.<eos> That's your business.<eos> All right?<eos> I don't want James Delaney to die either.<eos> Who are you?
Get them off! Come on!<eos> Check below. You, check the bilges.<eos> - There's nothing.<eos> - Well, it can't have just vanished.<eos> What's this?<eos> Cellar empty.<eos> Apart from rats and river water, sir.<eos> Keep looking!<eos> Carry on.<eos> You've had a fall.

Keep looking!<eos> Carry on.<eos> You've had a fall.<eos> You probably don't remember who you are, so let me remind you.<eos> You've been following me, haven't you?<eos> Now.<eos> Are you King or are you Company?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Now there is nothing up that road for you apart from death and anybody like you.<eos> So you run along and tell your friends how you almost lost your heart.
Sit.<eos> Sit there.<eos> I haven't told that boy anything.<eos> I didn't think it safe.<eos> The sacks of saltpetre in the barn were stolen.<eos> Why burden him?<eos> They were stolen from the Honourable East India Company.<eos> All right?<eos> Now anybody who knows of its whereabouts but does not report it is liable to hang.<eos> So, you are now one of us.
I know which one of you it is.<eos> And I want you to know that there will be no place for that man on my ship when we sail to the New World.<eos> Because he will be of no use to me.<eos> He will be of no use.<eos> For he will have no thumb.<eos> I am inside your heads, gentlemen.<eos> Always.<eos> £2 for broken doors and smashed windows.<eos> Damn soldiers!<eos> You owe me Delaney!
Let it be known along the Wapping Wall, it was the work of the devil Delaney.<eos> Ready?<eos> Good boy.<eos> What the hell are you doing here, at whatever the hell time of night it is?<eos> I thought I heard an explosion.<eos> All is well.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Making gunpowder and being careful are good bedfellows.<eos> What?<eos> What do you see?
You'd risk the life of your son for chlorate?<eos> He is, isn't he?<eos> They have your name, Mr. Cholmondeley.<eos> They have your name, and you will be first on the list of their conspirators.<eos> How do they know so much?<eos> Get the chlorate.<eos> Yes?<eos> I will get you men.<eos> James...<eos> You said his name!

It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well then, Mr. Chichester, I have some good news for you.<eos> From the Prince Regent himself.<eos> Wilton!<eos> To be continued, gentlemen.<eos> Did you receive the box of bananas I sent you...<eos> You will improve your game.<eos> You have to improve your fucking game!
You will improve your game.<eos> You have to improve your fucking game!<eos> Those bastards at the palace have opened a royal commission into the sinking of The Influence.<eos> The-The-The Influence?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, it's a personal campaign.<eos> A stab in my ribs.<eos> Now, you will deal with it.<eos> You and the Africa Desk.?<eos> A commission is not the King, so they can't subpoena, so you will deal with it and treat them with disbelief.

Well, that would require me to trust you.<eos> Based on mutual self-interest.<eos> Trust requires a little time.<eos> Something we have very little of, Mr. Delaney.<eos> What's this?<eos> A book from a Mr. Cholmondeley for Miss Bow.<eos> It came by post, with a letter.<eos> She obviously has an admirer.<eos> She asked me a lot of questions today.<eos> And did you give her a lot of answers?

Yes, I see it. I see it.<eos> Is there somewhere we can pin her down?<eos> Stop! Stop!<eos> You see those blemishes?<eos> It is the evil coming to the surface.<eos> It's almost done, my love.<eos> Can we untie her now?<eos> Leave her a few moments.<eos> Let her reflect... and recover.<eos> Will you come to bed?
Failure to secure His Majesty's gunpowder against the enemy is a criminal offence.<eos> It might be more effective if we went after Sir Stuart himself.<eos> Those bastards at the Palace have opened a Royal Commission into the sinking of the Influence.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves and were complicit in the deaths of those slaves.<eos> The bellmen and the newspapers tell me there's a new source of prime grade powder in town.<eos> Our guns will fall silent in ten days.<eos> We need the powder in eight.<eos> I need more gunpowder.<eos> You'd risk the life of your son for chlorate?<eos> - You are now one of us.
To protect you.<eos> To save your life, son.<eos> Desperate for your death!<eos> It took three men to pull you apart.<eos> She was clawing and spitting, dragged from the river howling and screaming.<eos> Be very, very careful now!<eos> She wanted you dead, James.<eos> Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> What are you scared of?
Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> What are you scared of?<eos> Of who they say you are.<eos> The African devil.<eos> Stop staring.<eos> You're scaring me.<eos> Go home to your mother.<eos> Helga loves you.<eos> You're safe there.
Perhaps we can glean some knowledge from him.<eos> Oh, if there's any darkness, that articled pimp will know about it.<eos> And then I intend to visit Zilpha Geary.<eos> Why are you not worried?<eos> He won't be dead, and he won't be happy.<eos> You can depend on that.<eos> Open up!<eos> Open the door, we know you're in there!<eos> - Darlin'?<eos> - What do you want?
- I don't need to...<eos> An actress... who enjoys walking with a man with human flesh in his teeth.<eos> You know, you can even buy a song about Delaney now.<eos> In Covent Garden, for a penny.<eos> I-I'll return when you're sober...<eos> It's about a cannibal who plans to eat the Prince Regent.<eos> So it can only be about Delaney.<eos> Forgive me, I was... just dressing.<eos> He's been gone two days...<eos> And she thought you might know where he is, because you are his sister.
I swear it.<eos> A position in Sydney, Australia.<eos> Ports and harbour assessor.<eos> And the jurisdiction of an assizes.<eos> And administration of felons through the docks.<eos> Never lock your door or draw your robe against me again, for I am an assessor!<eos> I applied for the position three months ago.<eos> I didn't tell you.<eos> Here.<eos> Read it. Won't you?
All fires extinguished.<eos> Gently, gently, gently, gentlemen.<eos> Have the greatest of respect for the inhabitant of this coffin.<eos> Famously volatile.<eos> Given to explosive fits of rage.<eos> May he rest in peace until he's reignited with his Saviour.<eos> Slow, slow, slow over the potted roads.<eos> The chlorate is still there, it's just sleeping.<eos> "For the purpose of preventing contagion." Hm?<eos> I saw you... and you saw something at the pond.

You tell me one thing that isn't just a matter of time.<eos> They say you're going to sell the gun powder to the Republicans.<eos> Republicans haven't got any money, why would I sell it to them?<eos> They think you're going to start a revolution.<eos> If the Prince genuinely thought I was going to start a revolution, I would be in the Tower.<eos> He's not a safeguard.<eos> If Crown and Company solve their little dispute, they will crush you between them.<eos> What did my sister say?<eos> Zilpha?<eos> What have you done?

- In the bedroom?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When did I, um...?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You stay here.<eos> I will tell Brace to arrange a carriage.<eos> By the time you get home, the body will be gone.<eos> Home?<eos> - You are sending me home?

Gentlemen... we have Delaney's factory.<eos> Finally!<eos> James.<eos> James. Catastrophe.<eos> The farmer Ibbotson took confession...<eos> - Calm down.<eos> - James... No.<eos> No. No.<eos> You are betrayed.<eos> You shouldn't be here.
It is in fucking pieces.<eos> I swear, I swear I didn't know.<eos> Now report.<eos> War has begun.<eos> Sorry about your news.<eos> Marshall.<eos> I need a ship.<eos> And I need to ensure no-one else betrays me.<eos> Your man did not heed my warning...<eos> You don't want much, do you?
War has begun.<eos> Sorry about your news.<eos> Marshall.<eos> I need a ship.<eos> And I need to ensure no-one else betrays me.<eos> Your man did not heed my warning...<eos> You don't want much, do you?<eos> You were meant to be guarding his ship.<eos> Two possibilities.<eos> He sold you out, cos you cut off his thumb, or you cut off his thumb, cos you knew he was going to sell you out.

Leave this body where it will be found.<eos> You can keep the heart.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> The devil's here.<eos> Go get some sleep.<eos> I don't need to sleep.<eos> I need... a ship.<eos> Maybe have a fuck first.<eos> Find a ship tomorrow.<eos> Why don't you find a captain and you take him upstairs and slit his throat, and I will take his ship?
Your father was poisoned.<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> Brace, what's the matter?<eos> The truth.<eos> Those bastards at the Palace have opened a Royal Commission into the sinking of the Influence.<eos> You are now one of us.

He's not in.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley?<eos> Miss Bow.<eos> What's going on?<eos> A bastard.<eos> I thought, in all your charity, you might extend some sustenance and some shelter to this poor, unfortunate boy.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Robert. It's Robert.<eos> You know James Delaney, do you?
And how would you know that?<eos> - I very well may have. - Mm.<eos> You might have done.<eos> But I do know you cared for her.<eos> You were kind to her.<eos> She told me.<eos> The boy Robert's arrived.<eos> You OK?<eos> Hello.<eos> Did you know Winter?
The river will only take her body.<eos> I will keep her soul.<eos> There's no certainty it was James that did it.<eos> There's no certainty that he did not.<eos> I'm getting scared, James.<eos> Too many bodies in the river.<eos> Can I sleep under your house tonight?<eos> No.<eos> Go away, I'm not fit to be near you now.<eos> You're among them now, aren't you?
In return, the Royal Commission will offer you a full pardon for your crime.<eos> For crime... it is.<eos> I have an alternative suggestion.<eos> In.<eos> I have a use for you.<eos> For the safe.<eos> Go.<eos> Murderer!<eos> Murderer!<eos> Do you know who blew up your ship?
For the safe.<eos> Go.<eos> Murderer!<eos> Murderer!<eos> Do you know who blew up your ship?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and... and I think we were right.<eos> There wasn't the time for such...<eos> And we have plenty of time.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> When you first came back, you told me you loved me.

- But you don't think.<eos> Do you?<eos> I know you.<eos> I know your nature.<eos> I know you. No.<eos> I believed once that we were the same person.<eos> We are.<eos> We are not. We are.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Perhaps you should thank your God for that.

Well, she'll go to the Company.<eos> It is inevitable.<eos> Fix the roof.<eos> Gunpowder and water don't mix.<eos> Where's Brace?<eos> In his room.<eos> He's been there all day, either mad or sick or drunk.<eos> We knocked.<eos> He won't answer.<eos> Brace, you are not sick and you are not dead yet.

It was a kindness.<eos> For who?<eos> We couldn't go on, James.<eos> But you did.<eos> You were dead.<eos> Everyone was at his throat.<eos> He was burning his own flesh!<eos> He had no need to go on.<eos> Nothing left to live for.<eos> So you did him a kindness.

We have some rather good news... for British patriots everywhere.<eos> James!<eos> You are betrayed!<eos> Two women came to Leadenhall...<eos> I know.<eos> Where are they now?<eos> A safe house.<eos> I have the address.<eos> I have a use for you.<eos> There's someone I need you to see.
And all of those who have use to me will sail along with me.<eos> And on my ship, there will be no rules and there will be no judgment.<eos> We're sailing to a new world and that is the plan.<eos> James... you are a fool.<eos> They are going to hang you.<eos> No, their case will flounder.<eos> They can't.<eos> And we can make this happen.<eos> You and me.<eos> And the best of it... you will never have to testify.

Your testimony will be with you within the week.<eos> Signed?<eos> And sealed.<eos> And if required, he will stand up in court?<eos> Let the good Lord be my witness... I will yell out the truth to the four winds.<eos> Until that happy resolution, I bid you good day, gentlemen.<eos> Mount up!<eos> To the Molly House!<eos> I cannot pack up my entire life in five minutes.<eos> Well, you can pack it up or you can lose it.
- Where's Temple?<eos> - He's not coming!<eos> Don't he want his share?<eos> - Hurry up, Temple!<eos> - Come on, Temple!<eos> Hello.<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> I want her to forgive me.<eos> For what?<eos> You know it's a sin not to tell the truth in a sacred place.
He bought some land and he bought a wife.<eos> Nootka was my mother's tribe.<eos> This small piece of land will be incredibly valuable to the Americans.<eos> Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I have something of great value to your nation, something the British are trying to kill me for.<eos> Someone has been brought to London to try and kill me, and I will need your eyes and ears from now on.<eos> You used to straighten your skirts and march away like nothing had ever happened.
For what do you risk your life?<eos> Can you loosen up these bindings so that I may move?<eos> Get up. Come on.<eos> Up.<eos> Up!<eos> Bill, what are you doing?<eos> - Here, take this.<eos> - Yes, boss.<eos> No reason we can't laugh at each other just cos we're now partners.<eos> I didn't say that you were my partner.

It's tender.<eos> Did you bring me salt beef?<eos> - Pork.<eos> - No.<eos> Fresh from a sloop from somewhere cold.<eos> - Short notice. - We don't eat pig!<eos> All right, all right.<eos> The stuff he's brought has been on the dock for ages.<eos> Yes, probably, but I trust him, so please pay him.<eos> Who are you?
By midday, Mr. Pettifer.<eos> I do what I can with the rotten dock trash Atticus brings, so the least you can do is sit before you refuse it.<eos> And if that sickly youth on the doorstep is there to protect you from East India assassins, know that by 2:00 AM he's easily distracted by whores.<eos> Well, you needn't worry about the East India Company.<eos> No need to worry about the Crown... any longer.<eos> For now I'm only in danger from the Americans but I reasoned that they are the lesser of the three adversaries, wouldn't you agree?<eos> I've been searching every fucking room in this house but not the cellar, so I must beat the tide.<eos> I must beat the tide.<eos> Hello?<eos> Winter, what are you doing here?

And like a wolf you tore out his heart, and then threw him into the river.<eos> Splash.<eos> And down he floats... directly into Winter's arms.<eos> So I cut out your spoils.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's for you.<eos> Teach me about magic.<eos> I want to be a wolf, too, or a bird so I can fly.<eos> The bird on your neck... I know what it is... The Sankofa.<eos> Now, you go home to Helga... because you are not safe here.
What mark?<eos> In the later days she did things... no-one understood.<eos> In the later days, when she wasn't allowed to walk the streets, nor show her face in public, nor speak in English, nor her savage tongue because she was a mad woman.<eos> - James.<eos> - No.<eos> Explain this.<eos> I have the very same mark on me... from when I was taken prisoner in Africa.<eos> What is it?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You don't speak but you do have answers.

Always, Sir, on account of her being a fussy, stuck up bitch, Sir.<eos> I am here on behalf of His Majesty the King.<eos> Give it to Miss Bow and only Miss Bow... on pain of execution.<eos> You bad, bad man.<eos> - Keep doing that.<eos> - Tickle, tickle!<eos> Spoken for, Sir.<eos> Dear, God.<eos> Spoken for, Sir.<eos> You haven't changed a bit, Godders.
- Tickle, tickle!<eos> Spoken for, Sir.<eos> Dear, God.<eos> Spoken for, Sir.<eos> You haven't changed a bit, Godders.<eos> I need to speak to you.<eos> Your secret won't remain a secret for very long in the East India Company.<eos> - Blackmail?<eos> - Yes. But between friends, so where's the harm?<eos> Now, you take the minutes, don't you, of every meeting and you also hear everything they say when they raise their hand?

I want that information.<eos> I will pay you for it.<eos> I'll pay you a pound every month.<eos> How did you know about me?<eos> Because I have eyes and ears everywhere throughout the city in many places, much like the Company itself.<eos> I honestly mean you no harm, Godders.<eos> - If I were caught...<eos> - What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.

Dear, Sister...<eos> I am restoring our father's offices I have registered the Delaney Trading Company with Lloyds of London and I will ready my ship so that when the time is right and the Company has fallen we can leave.<eos> I am accruing a band of loyal servants, none of whom have any value to me beyond the facilitation of this greater good.<eos> When I left England, I was just a boy.<eos> Now I am back, much has changed.<eos> Your leaving England was the click of the hypnotist's fingers.<eos> I woke from a trance and realised the depth of our sin.<eos> I have found forgiveness in God and in my husband, and I want no part in your plans or your future.<eos> But we are the future.<eos> Your husband is already passed and you can see that by the way that he follows you.
