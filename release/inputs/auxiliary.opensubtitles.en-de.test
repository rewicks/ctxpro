I am not.<eos> How did you manage to seduce Bina?<eos> Bad timing? It is bad timing, I realize that now.<eos> If I tell you this, will you stop walking with me?<eos> Not sure.<eos> It was summer camp.<eos> I was a junior counselor.<eos> She was a senior counselor.<eos> Honestly, Renzo, it's no big secret.<eos> Camp does most of the seducing.
We-we're gonna let him walk?<eos> He's not our problem.<eos> The bureau won't back you on this.<eos> - No, but you... - I...<eos> Won't back you.<eos> Speaking of interpol, - that ever check out?<eos> - What?<eos> In your report, you said this "Saint" set off a homing device alerting interpol to the nuke.<eos> Did that ever check out?<eos> -Yeah, yeah, yeah. It did.
Things are a little out of control, wouldn't you say, Cutz?<eos> I-I know, boss.<eos> Half our boys are in the cells.<eos> Ellman, I'm gonna sort this out, believe me.<eos> It's not about what I believe. It's about what you believe.<eos> Do you believe that if you don't make this right,<eos> I'll hold you personally responsible?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> And do you believe that the man I hold personally responsible won't be walking around on this Earth for very much longer?<eos> No. No, I don't.
- Where did you pick up the groom from?<eos> - Sir, I was picked up from the wedding altar before I could... Before I could even say 'l do.'<eos> - Sir, he is from Raees' area.<eos> Send them away.<eos> You come with me.<eos> - Get going.<eos> - Sir, I've done nothing I swear, I didn't do anything.<eos> - Do you know Raees?<eos> - l don't know anyone, sir.<eos> - How does he do his business?
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.<eos> She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.<eos> Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.<eos> As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit. This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.<eos> What?<eos> Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.<eos> This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - No, of course not. His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.<eos> I don't!
I like it.<eos> I'm changing the extraction point again.<eos> Negative on RV2. The extraction team is inbound now to RV2.<eos> No, we don't know what's waiting for us there.<eos> Extract on me. Negative. We can't enter Iranian airspace.<eos> No, we have no choice.<eos> Just send me the chopper.<eos> We'll need to get authorisation. Negative.<eos> No time.<eos> Just do it.
Tell me about your morning.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I don't.
Um... one sec.<eos> Need something?<eos> I, uh, just wanted to have a talk with you.<eos> Well, um, it'll have to wait till I'm done.<eos> Oh, but I ordered takeout.<eos> You what?<eos> I'm in the middle of a lesson.<eos> - Claire Temple. - Hey.<eos> How do you know each other?<eos> - Oh, well, um... she... - We... we don't really...
You okay, son?<eos> You look a little green.<eos> Hey, what happened to your hand?<eos> What happened to yours?<eos> Oh, kitchen accident.<eos> Who are they?<eos> Oh, the one without the tongue is Vando.<eos> The other guy, I didn't get his name. The Hand sent them over to deliver a message.<eos> - We have to call somebody.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Balvenie, 40-year-old.<eos> This is supposed to be the best... best single malt of all time.<eos> - Dad, it is too early to be drinking...<eos> - Come on. Open it.<eos> - and I'm...<eos> I can't. - One for you.<eos> One for me. Come on.<eos> - One for you, and one for me.<eos> - No, I don't want it. Dad, stop!<eos> I didn't... I didn't...
- Okay?<eos> I'm looking into this company, but they've been transferring assets from one corporation to the next.<eos> Like, they're changing their name, shell company stuff.<eos> Yet, I have no idea what it is they actually do.<eos> Oh, so what do you need from me?<eos> The oldest record dates back to 1820, but as crazy as this sounds, I need to go back further than that.<eos> Oh, well, you... you wanna go to the historical branch uptown.<eos> And you'll need an appointment.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Actually, you don't.
- Sorry to hear that, Gare.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - How 'bout if I buy you another one?<eos> - Yeah! Yeah, man!<eos> Now we're talking!<eos> - Definitely! - Yeah, one more for our friend.<eos> - One more.<eos> Yeah, on him. He's... - I got it.<eos> Always tastes better when it's free.<eos> - It does, though, a little bit.
So, The Sons of Africa.<eos> You write on their behalf.<eos> I write on behalf of humanity.<eos> As a man concerned with injustice.<eos> Against your people.<eos> Against people.<eos> For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.
And if you're known as a sex object your whole life and sex is all you know, where do you go?<eos> How do you apply for a job?<eos> You know, I've been fucking on film for the last 30 years?<eos> And it's important that you think about your future.<eos> You think about what's going to happen afterwards.<eos> I've been really lucky with... you know, I started three Web sites as well as doing my paintings and everything, I have my auction site.<eos> So I've always got a lot of different eggs in the basket and things to fall back on.<eos> 'Cause it scares me.<eos> You know, I don't want to be 60 and have nothing to show what I've worked for.<eos> I did a half-a-dozen films in, like, 2005.
That's convenient.<eos> Blame the victim.<eos> No, no one's blaming anyone.<eos> Okay, well, maybe we should be.<eos> You should be blaming the kids that make this school a terrible place.<eos> You should be blaming the kids that make other kids want to kill themselves.<eos> Are you referring to Hannah Baker?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Do you want to talk about Hannah?<eos> Do you?
I want to believe he held on to it.<eos> Why wouldn't he have taken this with him?<eos> Why would he leave it on the floor?<eos> There weren't tracks out there before.<eos> We didn't find anything now.<eos> Maybe Daryl could've picked something up.<eos> He left.<eos> He didn't leave a note.<eos> He obviously doesn't want to be found.<eos> Yes, he does.
Negan wants you where he is.<eos> You're an important fellow, Harlan.<eos> You're coming with us.<eos> Look, I... I have patients here that need me.<eos> Why does Negan need two doctors?<eos> Well, I think my look may have conveyed the information.<eos> People say I have an expressive face.<eos> But if not, let me repeat your question.<eos> Why do we need two doctors?<eos> Answer... we don't.
Just tell me.<eos> We want warmth so they'll put out shoots before the fast freeze.<eos> That way, we pull back the tarp, they die naturally, saves on all the endless weeding.<eos> Get to tarping.<eos> You got it, boss lady.<eos> Uh, wait.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I, uh... I'm not a farmer.<eos> I need some help here.<eos> No, you don't.
You didn't fail PJ.<eos> He was brilliant and brave.<eos> No, no, Denise is the brave one.<eos> Where do you think she got it from?<eos> Passionate. Unafraid to take a stand. Opinionated.<eos> That's PJ.<eos> That's PJ.<eos> You only saw him on the holidays.<eos> Hell, I'm not even sure I ever really knew him.<eos> - Maybe nobody did.
I'm looking for my son's program.<eos> Bathwater?<eos> Sure.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Anne Wu gave you that. Why?<eos> She hired me to crack it and get it ready for the market.<eos> Wait.<eos> PJ wanted to distribute this free.<eos> How do I do that?<eos> He did?
You?<eos> You said you were a lawyer.<eos> I studied to become a lawyer.<eos> I need help with a legal matter.<eos> I'll help, if I can.<eos> Tell me more.<eos> I'm sure you've heard by now that I was the Carlán's maid, and he never married me.<eos> Yes, you've heard.<eos> What people don't know is that my husband, suspecting the anarchists would kill him, married me so our children would be his heirs.<eos> We did it at the monastery.
Look, I-I-I don't know what you think is going on or why, but you need to understand something.<eos> The man in there is a US soldier just released from psychiatric care, suffering from severe PTSD, and this is making things worse.<eos> Let me go in and talk to him.<eos> He's already got two hostages.<eos> - I'm not gonna give him a third. - I'm telling you-- They're not hostages and he's not a shooter!<eos> When I left this morning, I asked him to protect my daughter.<eos> And he is!<eos> From people throwing rocks, from this army you've got out here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do! - I-
Well, her father had red hair, and-- and she has red hair, so at first, whenever I looked, what I'd see...<eos> What I'd see was that he wasn't there.<eos> She reminded you of his absence.<eos> Not just that.<eos> Of my role in his not being there.<eos> I knew where everything was heading. I-<eos> - I knew.<eos> And I pushed him toward that.<eos> I-I really-- I really don't like this.<eos> No one does.
I lied for them.<eos> I saved their asses.<eos> Yeah, true, this time around.<eos> But, Majid, you've been dropping missiles on their heads for the past 30 years.<eos> That's got to take a toll.<eos> You gonna answer it?<eos> Oh, I was unable to mention this earlier, but our partners at Mossad came to me when they found out you were in the country.<eos> I said "Leave him alone.<eos> He's got important work to do."<eos> Which I did.
- Just a minute.<eos> You'll want to hear this.<eos> That was Brett O'Keefe on the phone.<eos> He says he made the video.<eos> He admits it now when we already know?<eos> He says he's responding to your call to come out of hiding.<eos> He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.<eos> No debate, no prep, just two people talking. His words.<eos> Which, obviously, you don't want to do.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
Yes, the invention worked.<eos> This would be a perfect time to leave and pretend the rest of the story was just as happy and successful.<eos> I just wish Mother and Father had seen it.<eos> It's not like them to send us off on our own so unexpectedly.<eos> Certainly, I wish I could go back and change the history of the Baudelaires at this very moment rather than the descent into misery, tribulation and... dire inconvenience which will occur shortly.<eos> It only seems scary because of all the mist.<eos> It's Mr. Poe.<eos> From the bank?<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> - How do you do? - How do you do?
- 24/7? - Exactly.<eos> Shall we proceed?<eos> Alright.<eos> Ms. Vos. Beautiful day, isn't it?<eos> You must be Will.<eos> Michael.<eos> Welcome to Alterplex.<eos> Can't stay here.<eos> We should keep moving. Look at what they've done.<eos> - And what about what you did, Michael?
Thanks, I have to go.<eos> And I wanted to say that you won't lose me.<eos> - I will lose you.<eos> - No. - You'll never forgive me.<eos> - No.<eos> When are you seeing him?<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> Are you going to bed with him?<eos> Don't do this.
Do you want some?<eos> No.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're too classy for me, too?<eos> Where's your boyfriend?<eos> We're just a team for the race.<eos> That's all.<eos> - I thought you guys were... - Yeah.<eos> So did I.
I wonder why they don't let cars in.<eos> Maybe it's cause they've heard that some cars eat people.<eos> Did you feel that? - EMP.<eos> - That's electromagnetic pulse.<eos> It disables anything with an electric charge. That's right.<eos> Sheriff Leon has me run an EMP device at all times.<eos> Creates a barrier around the town.<eos> There's no power allowed in Red River.<eos> Cars end up just stalling out.<eos> Not sure why it did that to your necks, though.
They asked me to go with them.<eos> Look, if you wanna leave, by all means.<eos> I'm not going anywhere, Luke.<eos> But there's only a few of us left.<eos> How's the pack going to survive?<eos> Look, I don't care if it's just you and me, we'll figure out a way.<eos> But I won't let it come to that.<eos> I've been out recruiting other members from other packs.<eos> Trust me. Plenty of wolves want to eat at the Jade Wolf.<eos> No, they don't.
Sorry, but the Wi-Fi in here is incredibly slow.<eos> Well, you take your time.<eos> Got 3 patties and 3 slices of cheddar to go.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> Ok.<eos> Actually got it.<eos> Our screaming Sonic lady has a name... Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.<eos> That tracks. She was in central city when the particle accelerator exploded.<eos> After that, she went off the grid, which means that we have no way of finding her.<eos> Yes, we do.
Because you and I are gonna sit in this office until we figure out a reasonable set of limitations that respects everyone's rights.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Should I order something in?<eos> We might be here a while.<eos> I don't know anything, man.<eos> I don't know--<eos> I know you've seen this scumbag.<eos> He lives in this neighborhood!<eos> I don't know everybody, dude.<eos> I don't!
Hey, we just want to find this guy before anyone else gets hurt.<eos> Why aren't the police doing this?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll make sure the information gets to the right people.<eos> I heard he was staying with a friend.<eos> Let me see if I can get you the address.<eos> Felicity said you wanted me here.<eos> Was it 'cause you wanted me to hear that woman's story?<eos> No.<eos> But since you did...
On it.<eos> Ten will get you 20, that's exactly what this is.<eos> One thing at a time.<eos> - Yo!<eos> - Hey, Thea called.<eos> She says she needs to talk to you.<eos> She said it was important.<eos> Thea, I thought that we agreed not to look at whatever's on that drive.<eos> Ollie, you have a habit of giving orders and just assuming that they are agreements, but you have got to see this.<eos> No, I don't.
Transparency?<eos> - Magnus! Magnus, let's not make this personal.<eos> How can I not make it personal?<eos> Valentine wants me dead.<eos> He wants all of us dead.<eos> I know.<eos> And after I bared my heart and soul.<eos> I told you things I've never told anyone.<eos> You looked me straight in the eye and lied.<eos> Magnus, I didn't...
I saw him give it over.<eos> Right over there, right at that table over there. That's where he took his last glass of evil, vile fuckin' mead, and made his bargain with the devil himself.<eos> Your piece of shit husband got a new life.<eos> Why don't you?<eos> This one got a new life.<eos> He ain't lookin' back.<eos> I did. And I'm not.<eos> Shadow made my heart beat again.<eos> Why do men like anal sex?<eos> 'Cause women don't.
- And he's brave. - Yeah.<eos> He's a hero, and he's probably pretty cute under that mask.<eos> Yeah, I think so, too.<eos> Come on, Joanie, honey, Kid Flash?<eos> He's a showboat... he's snapping selfies, he's leaving graffiti bolts on buildings.<eos> - Okay, that's his signature move.<eos> - That's kind of his signature. Yeah, well, from what I hear, The Flash is the one who's actually saving people.<eos> Sounds like Cecile's Team Flash.<eos> Joanie, my dad would never brag about this, but he knows Kid Flash.<eos> You do?
Just take these.<eos> I wear glasses?<eos> You will now.<eos> Just put 'em on.<eos> - You'll be okay.<eos> - Just don't get them wet.<eos> - [clears throat] Your Honor, I, uh... - What? Wh...<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do, yes.
- ... is what it is. You know what?<eos> It's my home.<eos> It's my...<eos> It's my family.<eos> Although, I... you know what, I will say...<eos> I have to tell you, I haven't always felt - I belong completely.<eos> - What? Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I did. - Oh, yeah, you did.
'Cause from what I remember, that really messed you up.<eos> Yeah, 'cause you're so big on second chances and all. Yeah... yes.<eos> I'm not saying it was gonna be easy, but the code demands it.<eos> "The code."<eos> This is not some werewolf.<eos> Do... Do you have any idea what will happen if this abomination is born?<eos> Mick...<eos> So until then... I say we drink.<eos> Dagon. Hear me.<eos> I do, sire.
It was an accident.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Hey! She killed a man of letters.<eos> S-she has to die.<eos> It was an accident! It doesn't matter!<eos> The code.<eos> No, hey, screw the code. Don't make this harder than it already is.<eos> Mick, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do!
That is not your job.<eos> And when in our whole lives have we ever been safe?<eos> This is my responsibility because it is my plan.<eos> Your plan?<eos> He's taking me to Heaven. You...<eos> You're taking her to the sandbox?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm ending this, once and for all.<eos> Kelly and her baby have to die.<eos> No, they don't.
English, drexel.<eos> The ability to control is transferring from crowley to you.<eos> So you're saying that crowley's gonna be my puppet.<eos> Good dog.<eos> You sat for lady bevell.<eos> How can you even tell?<eos> Am I gonna say "bad dog"?<eos> He can be unpleasant.<eos> Dr. hess says that you have designs on Mick Davies' job.<eos> Did she?
I'll get you something for the pain.<eos> Make it a double.<eos> Aw. You wanna play mother to my son?<eos> He's all yours.<eos> Dean... that's not your mom.<eos> What's the matter, Dean?<eos> Am I too different from the Mary you know?<eos> Or too much the same?<eos> Here she is.<eos> Do your thing.
One hundred percent!<eos> Out of what?<eos> You two are the only ones who've ever gotten a perfect score.<eos> Us two?<eos> [Yuko] It is on.<eos> [Jacqueline] Here's how we handle DJ Fingablast.<eos> Men always want what they can't have.<eos> Cuban cigars, a watchable Superman movie.<eos> Just act like you don't want the gig.<eos> I don't.
- oh, well, i--i--i don't know what to say, sheriff.<eos> That's--that's truly awful news. - yes, it is.<eos> I just thought you should know Jim Blackwell won't be bothering you.<eos> still like to know why he had your address.<eos> And what Alex romero might have to do with any of this.<eos> - I--i--just--i can't imagine.<eos> - looks like someone left here in a hurry.<eos> Yeah, that, that was a... An unruly guest.<eos> I--i guess raking the gravel is next up. - I thought you said you hadn't had any guests?<eos> - Really, did...
Give me that bottle.<eos> Zelda, you're not like his other women.<eos> You're a challenge.<eos> You're smart and witty and fearless.<eos> He might not always know how to deal with that.<eos> He'd better learn.<eos> He basically married the heroine of his stories.<eos> This city doesn't make a lick of sense to me.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> No one does.
Scott, it's adorable.<eos> Look at us. Our own little corner house, just like real marrieds.<eos> Max really came through.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh. No, no.<eos> Just like real marrieds.<eos> They forgot the furniture.<eos> Or we did.
I'm not gonna be flying anywhere with this.<eos> Tana, can you get the gin in the cabinet, please?<eos> Scott, please.<eos> That'll be all, Tana.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why are you sending Tana away?<eos> You didn't want to do any of this.<eos> Fine, I'll get it myself.<eos> We have to stop this, both of us.<eos> No, we don't.
And I tried not to, but I do.<eos> And I'm worried if we spend too much time together... we might do something that will get us both in trouble.<eos> Like what?<eos> Are you sure you want this?<eos> Are you thinking about Tristan?<eos> Was that a weird thing to say?<eos> Very.<eos> - Thought you might be feeling...<eos> - Guilty?<eos> So... do you?
If you are able to show affection to your romantic partner in public without fear of bullying... take a step forward.<eos> If your school holidays coincide with the religious holidays you observe at home... take a step forward.<eos> Next question.<eos> I want you to shave your armpits.<eos> Look... I'm sorry I changed the picture without asking.<eos> I talked to the yearbook guy and resubmitted the untouched photo.<eos> I... I just feel like we should be honest about what we like.<eos> - And you don't like armpit hair?<eos> - I do not like armpit hair.<eos> Well, what if I do?
No, they're not.<eos> Arya...<eos> Bran's home, too.<eos> You came home.<eos> I saw you at the crossroads.<eos> You saw me?<eos> I see quite a lot now.<eos> Bran has... visions.<eos> I thought you might go to King's Landing.<eos> So did I.
Did he think I wanted to be born this way?<eos> - Did he think I chose it...<eos> - What do you want? !<eos> Daenerys will win this war.<eos> You're a military man.<eos> You must know there's no way around that.<eos> Daenerys is not her father.<eos> She's even willing to suspend the hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.<eos> If you want Cersei to bend the knee, you can ask her yourself.<eos> I... I don't.
I lied.<eos> That woman was my grandma.<eos> She has dementia. She's been going around pawning the family valuables.<eos> I've been all over town trying to track down what she sold.<eos> Most of it was worthless, like...<eos> like that clock there, but then my father's Rolex went missing, which belonged to his father before him.<eos> It's the only memento I have left.<eos> So when I came in here and I saw the watch... something came over me.<eos> Well, if you ask instead of take, I would have told you that Grandma didn't bring in the watch.<eos> Bank manager with gambling problem did.
You don't know me.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - You don't know me!<eos> You don't fuckin' know me.<eos> We're okay. We're okay.<eos> - We're okay.<eos> - Don't know me.<eos> Wait.<eos> I like fucking you.<eos> You don't fucking...
Felix, what do you need us to do? Nothing.<eos> I don't need anything.<eos> Just... Where's Helena?<eos> She's out hunting.<eos> Trapping.<eos> It's all categorised as hunting, Donnie.<eos> I know. But specifically, she's trapping.<eos> Okay, this is dire, Donnie.<eos> He needs some ideas of concrete plan on how to save Kira.<eos> No, no, no, I don't, Donnie.
They want a truce.<eos> A truce?<eos> Kidnapping children is a Neodefinition of a truce?<eos> You need to understand the benevolence on offer here. Comes from above.<eos> I'm sworn not to harm a single hair on a single clone head.<eos> - Now, where's is Helena?<eos> - Er... - In the woods.<eos> - What's her backup plan?<eos> I don't know her backup plan.<eos> - You do. - No!
I mean, I feel like I already know the answer, but are you crazy?<eos> How are they my responsibility?<eos> Because your crooked boss took a payoff to let them off that boat.<eos> What am I supposed to do with them?<eos> Get them jobs.<eos> There are plenty of Chinese restaurants, laundries--<eos> Now who's racist?<eos> No. Because those are places where other Chinese people already work.<eos> They don't speak English, dumbass.<eos> I do little bit.
Yeah?<eos> I'll ask the questions here, you don't mind. So what happened between you and Chester, anyway?<eos> I grew up.<eos> He found out about my nature and threw me out. Now, you people, you like little boys, too, don't ya?<eos> I thought you was my people.<eos> I like little boys as much as you like little girls... brotha. It says here, Leonard was a... war hero?<eos> I was in 'Nam myself.<eos> How about you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You did... two years for it?
Brantley Jermaine House.<eos> The only four whose first or last names start with "B."<eos> And they all lived in Cooperstown.<eos> - Cooperstown? - Mm.<eos> Thought maybe we could start by talking to their mothers, look for fences missing a gate.<eos> That's your bright idea, huh?<eos> Just drive around town, lookin' for a gate that ain't there no more.<eos> Might as well just put that damn noose around my neck myself.<eos> - What the... - Goddamn!<eos> The hell you doing in my truck, you little piece of shit? !
I know I'm a little early.<eos> But I came to bring you... a graduation present.<eos> This is a job offer.<eos> Not just any job offer.<eos> An associate, at Rand Kaldor Zane.<eos> I already have a job when I graduate.<eos> Rachel, we talked about this.<eos> When you graduate, you're gonna have to stand before the bar and pass the character and fitness test.<eos> And you think working at your firm looks better than looking at mine.<eos> Yes, I do.
It is his baby.<eos> And you're gonna want it to have as much love as it possibly can, and that means having a good relationship with its father, because there's nothing more important than family.<eos> You're right.<eos> Thank you, Harvey.<eos> - Hey, Mike.<eos> How's it going out there?<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> - I want you to take a look at this.<eos> - Let me get this straight, you want Oliver to petition the court to let Marissa argue his case.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Why would you think I would ever do that?<eos> I am saving these people.<eos> I am giving them a replica of their life with less pain.<eos> Yes.<eos> But their physical bodies will eventually give out because of it.<eos> Aida, that doesn't matter.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
Well, it's these two guys...<eos> Well, it's a little team, and, they put myths to the test.<eos> Like...<eos> Let me think of a good one here.<eos> Um, man, I'm drawing a blank.<eos> I watch this show all the time.<eos> I can't believe I can't know of one. It would be like, if somebody breaks a window on a plane, would that create a vacuum?<eos> And they put it to the test.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay. Does it?
Some of them were pretty far along.<eos> Yeah, well, that's not going to happen to you.<eos> You know Linda from Marketing? yeah.<eos> She actually carried to term but her son only lived a few days.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
And that girl, that ungrateful girl, she snapped at me.<eos> She bit you? . You know how they get.<eos> I'm just counting the days until Angela's weaned and that girl is out of my house.<eos> - Hey. Did you see my baby?<eos> Isn't she beautiful?<eos> She's so beautiful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How are you doing? I was... I was so worried that she would look like her father.<eos> Caleb looked like his father.<eos> But she does...
It'd be great if that's not what you're saying.<eos> Yes, it would be.<eos> Let's keep this simple. If your daughter misses school again, she's going to be suspended.<eos> Suspended? If Abby is going through some typical teenage problem that happens to any typical family like ours, instead of punishing her you should show her some compassion.<eos> And you shouldn't tell me how to do my job.<eos> Well, maybe if you did it right, then all the parents wouldn't talk about you<eos> - like you are a steaming pile of...<eos> Let's all stop talking until I can think of what to say next.<eos> Okay, we'll speak to our daughter and make sure she never misses school again.<eos> Because if she does...
You're serious?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - Wait. So, hold on...<eos> You went to another planet without me?<eos> - No way.<eos> - Milky Way.<eos> See, here's the thing, my friend.<eos> Guardian, he protects the Earth, but Agent Schott? He protects the stars.<eos> I'll see you on the street, James.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> I almost didn't.
- Because he was not a good man.<eos> So... You know what? I'm sorry about that.<eos> But this is not about you and your suspicion, and your disrespect are out of line. And you need to leave my home.<eos> - Kara...<eos> - No. - That's the...<eos> - No, no!<eos> You've ignored what I need from moment one today.<eos> I asked for privacy and time and you ignored that.<eos> And I asked you to give Jeremiah the benefit of the doubt and you ignored that too.<eos> So I don't...
Mom said he was a witch.<eos> That he came to help me feel better.<eos> But I feel worse. I know.<eos> I know.<eos> But don't worry, because as we speak, your mother and your Uncle Elijah are working with Vincent to fix you up.<eos> So you just stay calm and they'll make everything all right.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> The Hollow?<eos> No, sweetheart...<eos> I don't.
This place... this city... a lot of tragedy happened here.<eos> A lot I regret.<eos> But Hope was born here.<eos> So there was good with all that bad.<eos> After everything that's happened, the city is yours.<eos> I hope it brings you peace.<eos> Good-bye, Marcel.<eos> Do one thing for me.<eos> Tell your daughter she doesn't need to fear me.<eos> She never did.
The Latinas got a dorm.<eos> Blacks are all over the offices.<eos> - What do the white people have?<eos> Nothing. - Everything.<eos> Territory is off-limits.<eos> Then you ain't gettin' King.<eos> And... we're taking our stock public.<eos> Who wants to buy Judy King?<eos> - Selling to the highest bidder.<eos> - I do.
Yep. That sucks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> From the ocean floor below to the mountain peaks above.<eos> From the food you eat to the mess you make.<eos> We're behind it.<eos> Making a today great for you and a tomorrow great for us.<eos> Custer Jesse.<eos> The Dork The Dork Docs will see you now.<eos> - Dude...<eos> - You did it.
- What time?<eos> - Uh, I'm not sure.<eos> Disappeared, huh?<eos> Our records indicate he called you that night at, uh, 11:47 p.m.<eos> - Yeah, that sounds right.<eos> - That right?<eos> Yeah, could be.<eos> You spoke for a minute and 12 seconds.<eos> What'd you talk about?<eos> - Well, we didn't.
A lap dance... now that's dancing around a hard dick.<eos> And a hard dick presents opportunities.<eos> You understand what I mean by that?<eos> What do I mean by that?<eos> I know what opportunities are.<eos> Well, you're no fucking beauty.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Ain't necessarily a bad thing.<eos> More important is, you know how to tease a man.<eos> Do you?
What was said?<eos> What did you speak about?<eos> I told him his father was heartbroken because I left.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> Where you going?<eos> Wendy?<eos> He asked me if I loved his dad.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What did you say?<eos> That I didn't.
I wanna make a toast... to the love of my life.<eos> Belle, I wanna tell you something.<eos> I have never been as happy as I am right now.<eos> You're gonna make me cry.<eos> Keep going.<eos> What is it?<eos> I've never felt more alive... ♪ If you have half a brain ♪<eos> ...more honest than I do right now.
- Yeah, I switched out.<eos> Wren took my shift. I just wasn't feeling it today.<eos> So what? You just felt like doing yoga instead?<eos> Yeah, well.<eos> It's not actually yoga, but-- I just-<eos> - I needed to clear my head.<eos> I'm not sure I actually wanna work at the restaurant anymore.<eos> - So, what is this place?<eos> - Hey, did you talk with Topher?<eos> Yes. No, I did.
Never changed for me.<eos> I didn't wanna be responsible for anyone.<eos> I didn't want it.<eos> In some ways... I envy you, Sally.<eos> The only thing you ever cared about... was your family.<eos> For you... it was simple.<eos> Well... whatever it was, Roy... it wasn't simple.<eos> Three of us went out on that boat.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I don't... I don't...
Our husband will choose who goes first.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Don't challenge me on day one.<eos> Otherwise, I'll throw your skinny body to the dogs, you fake beauty!<eos> -Look who is talking!<eos> -These women's voices are so scary.<eos> I'll make you...<eos> You...<eos> Women, our husband will hear you.<eos> Don't do this.
I've lost you!<eos> Race mode.<eos> Here we go.<eos> In race mode, everything is in a tensed-up state:<eos> The throttle response, the gearbox, the steering.<eos> And the traction control is off!<eos> This has now been transformed from something that was brilliant... into something that is sensational.<eos> Of course, you'd never drive in race mode on the road, in the same way you'd never take your wristwatch into space.<eos> But it's nice to know that it would still work if you did.<eos> And this does. Boy, this does.
- This place is insane.<eos> - You like this stuff? - Yeah.<eos> My kids were never really into war stuff, so I've never been here.<eos> - Me either.<eos> My dad works.<eos> But we do other fun stuff.<eos> Oh, I don't doubt it.<eos> Butkiss was a fun guy.<eos> - You know my dad?<eos> - I do. Well, I did.
Nick.<eos> Not this time.<eos> Do what your mommy says. Come on.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nick, Nick, easy there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me have the pistol, son.<eos> You can't let her die.<eos> If she's got a pulse, we'll let her in.<eos> But you got to give me the gun.<eos> Do it, Nick.
- Will you go to Jake's?<eos> Leave her be, Mom.<eos> Morning.<eos> You, uh, seen your daughter? No.<eos> Jake's AWOL with some gear and he's not in his quarters.<eos> I know your daughter and him are, uh... courting.<eos> Could they just sneak past the guards?<eos> There's a lot of acreage out there, and Jake does know every inch of it, so it could be.<eos> Well, where should we start looking?<eos> - We don't.
Besides, Ángeles is a smart lady.<eos> She must know what her husband's like.<eos> [Ángeles] Mario, I didn't tell you...<eos> Sara offered me a promotion.<eos> That's why I couldn't resign.<eos> I didn't tell you because I didn't know how you'd react.<eos> And we've been arguing so much, I was afraid you wouldn't understand.<eos> So why tell me now?<eos> Because now I know what I want, Mario.<eos> I do now.
The 25th?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Peter MacLeish is president?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hannah... tell me what evidence you have against Peter MacLeish.<eos> Speaker Hookstraten to see you, sir.<eos> What can I do for you, Kimble?<eos> You can tell me what the hell's going on in your mind.<eos> You know if you open those markets tomorrow, it'll be a disaster.<eos> No, I don't.
Thank you.<eos> Is she here?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Bring her in.<eos> Clear the floor!<eos> It's all right, Mike.<eos> Agent Wells.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> I understand you have some things you want to tell me about Peter MacLeish.<eos> Yes, sir. I do.
We've been trying to figure that shit out since we first heard it.<eos> That's right.<eos> And it's a baffling line for a number of reasons.<eos> First and foremost, we all know Deion Sanders doesn't read, right?<eos> He doesn't read.<eos> Doesn't read.<eos> But assuming that he does read and he's an avid library fan...<eos> If everybody followed that principle, that would bankrupt America. You know what I mean?<eos> Plus, he wants money.<eos> Why does he...
She's a tough little girl.<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> She may need to be in times to come.<eos> Especially since the party may soon be over.<eos> Dreyfuss is alive, and Jobe is in the wind.<eos> Is there any indication what they have planned?<eos> No, but it can't be good.<eos> I know no one wants to confront the reality of the situation, but the fact of the matter is that it falls to us to act in the best interest of Dreyfuss Enterprises.<eos> We've had no contact with Malcolm for days, and serious decisions need to be made, so...<eos> Yes, they do.
I enjoy long stories.<eos> Yeah, he does.<eos> In short, my fellow travelers and I...<eos> Fellowship, if you will.<eos> We're on a journey to destroy an object.<eos> One which would bring the bearer unimaginable power.<eos> Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I came across numerous obscure references to it in my studies.<eos> Of course, such a divine artifact could never actually exist.<eos> But it does.
It's sent.<eos> All right.<eos> Now we wait.<eos> We're working on all channels here.<eos> Matt Cruz is on with the consulate right now.<eos> We could get an immediate extradition, but it's just the beginning.<eos> I really screwed up and I'm so sorry.<eos> It was for the right reason.<eos> I don't know what happened, but I know I didn't kill anyone.<eos> We do, too. Hey.
That's not yours.<eos> Give it back.<eos> Unh-unh-unh!<eos> I'll be holding on to this.<eos> I wouldn't want you ruining my plans by writing me out of existence with a swoop of your authorial pen.<eos> That's what you think I want... to make you disappear?<eos> Well, isn't it?<eos> After all, that's what Regina wants.<eos> That's because she thinks you're the worst parts of her.<eos> But you don't?
Have a wonderful evening.<eos> Another secret you were hoping I'd never find out about.<eos> Don't walk away from me, Vincent.<eos> Vincent!<eos> Are you going to say anything?<eos> I'll sort it.<eos> How?<eos> How does it get sorted, Vincent?<eos> Eh? Are you going to find 50 grand down the back of the sofa?<eos> Like I always do, on my own.
Right, well, I shall be on my way.<eos> Why do you always have to be such an arsehole?<eos> Because without arseholes, Samantha, shit would never get done.<eos> Sometimes when a Mum and a Dad fall out of love, it's better for everyone if they stop being husband and wife and start living in different houses.<eos> Which is why I now live in a flat Ronnie Farrell used to rent out to a dominatrix.<eos> Hello.<eos> Is Mistress Trixie available?<eos> Mistress Trixie doesn't live here any more, all right.<eos> Oh, Okay.<eos> Who does then?
He might be the first competitor to complete it!<eos> Oh, look at the glide.<eos> This is what he does.<eos> There go those magnetic footholds.<eos> He's coming around to that curved section.<eos> Ooh, will this be our first finisher?<eos> Let me tell you, he's gonna make it.<eos> He's gonna make it!<eos> He's going to make it!<eos> He does it!
What have you done, Felicia?<eos> I'm so sorry, love. You said you were in Peru.<eos> I took no joy in deceiving youl wanted to be sure before I told you.<eos> Before I risked<eos> I know how comfortable you are with our life, with what we have.<eos> All I know is that when Richard called, I knew what he was saying was true.<eos> Please...<eos> None of us knows what's true.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
We had taken the medicine.<eos> There was a campfire.<eos> When I woke up, you and Silas and Steve told me the story.<eos> But I didn't see any of it. "The story"?<eos> Tell them that you acted out of spite, that you'll support their leadership.<eos> It's over.<eos> I want you home with me.<eos> I...<eos> I, want to apologize and, to be clear... she knows how badly she's fucked up.<eos> Bill She does.
I mean, there's no reason you gotta tell your doctor the truth.<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> I'm all done.<eos> Want me to take it up for you?<eos> I can't.<eos> What?<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I thought it's what I wanted, but... now that I'm here and it's all happenin'...<eos> You wanna leave?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- What do you mean?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> I mean, I hope they aren't becoming addled, dear, as seniors are wont to do.<eos> They hardly want to, darling.<eos> I don't like this biscuit.<eos> Then don't eat it.<eos> Well, it can't be a peaceable household, it simply can't.<eos> The girl is an orphan, after all.<eos> How does one know what one is really getting?<eos> - One doesn't.
I know what I saw. And I told you, plain and simple.<eos> No doubt about it.<eos> - Typical.<eos> The boy who cried wolf...<eos> - What?<eos> - You cried wolf. - I haven't!<eos> I saw the wolf.<eos> The wolf is real. If there is a pandemic, it should have been mentioned online by now.<eos> - Not everything turns up on Facebook.<eos> - Yes, actually, it does.
Then hand it over.<eos> And the spell to get Hook back.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> All right.<eos> We have a deal.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Since I'm sure we have work to do, let's get my pirate back.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> Actually, yes, I did.
You may not have killed her, but our dear spider came close enough.<eos> As her life ebbed away, the portal opened just enough to allowed dear old Mum to slip through.<eos> Oh, Gideon.<eos> Don't tell me you underestimated me.<eos> The spider was an ingenious stroke on my part, but you played yours to the hilt.<eos> I was under your thrall.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> True.<eos> But part of you wanted to help me, though, didn't it?<eos> Part of you always does.
As soon as the contest began, Seamus made it plain that my new role in life was to be his winch bitch.<eos> OK, got to go, go, go.<eos> - What, I've got to get out? - Yeah.<eos> Where the hell do you think I'm gonna go?<eos> Go with the winch rope to that tree over there.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> This is like being a... hippopotamus.<eos> OK, the clock is ticking.<eos> Having got our first punch, I was hoping the day might get a bit less terrible.<eos> But it didn't.
- No.<eos> - Give me the phone.<eos> Cut it out.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Give me the phone.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> Take it easy!<eos> - Let go of me! Take it easy.<eos> You want to talk to Ravn?<eos> Do you?
Get to a pod, now. -Who are you?<eos> -I am Ulaz.<eos> Now, come on!<eos> Zarkon will know that I released you, so I must disappear.<eos> But, if you survive, go to the coordinates in your arm.<eos> -The Blade of Marmora is with you.<eos> -Why are you helping me?<eos> As a fighter and a leader, you give hope.<eos> Hurry! Earth needs you.<eos> We all do.
That's it.<eos> - Can you go like this as well?<eos> - I can.<eos> It works!<eos> - Would you look at that!<eos> - I'll just take a blood sample. Have as many as you...<eos> Just drain it all, if you like.<eos> They know you're here now.<eos> But at least she knows I'm alive.<eos> So do the police.
More money for the Pentagon when it's own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25% of what it already spends.<eos> According to some estimates we cannot track 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions.<eos> $2.3 trillion with a "T."<eos> That's $8,000 for every man, woman, and child in America.<eos> We're spending well over a $100 million per day on classified programs that have no congressional oversight, no public scrutiny, uh, there is no monitor of these programs.<eos> A number of these programs go directly through Congress, totally.<eos> When you start going through these documents, these programs start dropping off the radar screen.<eos> These are all classified programs within the defense budget, but they don't supply any technical information on the program.<eos> And if people think that the Congress and the President actually have a hand on this, they're gravely mistaken.<eos> They do not.
The things we miss, the rituals...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - She doesn't like me.<eos> - She will.<eos> Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him.<eos> You know you can't legally remove Claire Underwood, - even if you win in the House?<eos> - I'm working on that. I'm not interested.<eos> He needs you.<eos> I need you.<eos> So does the country.
The president had no idea.<eos> You were close to Mr. Macallan?<eos> Yes, but that doesn't mean that I knew what he was up to.<eos> But then how do you know the president wasn't involved?<eos> I was the last person to see Aidan.<eos> He confessed to me.<eos> He secretly used the NSA, FISA, to manipulate the electorate.<eos> We're meeting with counsel to perfect the rest of the testimony.<eos> As long as no one has anything that contradicts you.<eos> No one does.
- You tell me what you can do for me.<eos> - I've been around your kind.<eos> Not usually at this level.<eos> But you can't help yourself.<eos> Make me an offer, Ms. Davis.<eos> What is she worth to you?<eos> A lot.<eos> So then here's what I'm thinking.<eos> Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Until I saw her on that stamp, I thought she was your girlfriend.<eos> Gloria, I can't believe you don't know how to change a tire.<eos> You drove a taxi.<eos> Surely you had a flat.<eos> I had a lot of flats, but I would reapply my makeup and I would wait and then, in five minutes, I would have my own pit crew.<eos> You know, after we get this tire changed, do you still want to go to the rally or should we just drop you off in 1950?<eos> - Uh, guys, there's, uh... - Oh.<eos> - You need help with that tire?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, we don't.
We think Enger is the one who took Helena.<eos> They want you next.<eos> Interpol... just took over two fresh murder cases from us.<eos> What... What murders?<eos> This Neolution thing.<eos> You want to tell me how you're connected?<eos> Wait... What did Enger say?<eos> Enough to get me listening.<eos> So you have no idea how wrapped up in this she is?<eos> No, I don't.
- What's going to happen to Leif?<eos> - He's not the one I'm after.<eos> Hello.<eos> Everything all right here?<eos> Yes.<eos> OK.<eos> - Per... - It has to be this way, Leif.<eos> - What?<eos> - It has to.<eos> It doesn't.
He seems to have a strategy.<eos> This is a man who's done obstacle courses.<eos> I want to see what his strategy is going to be!<eos> Look at his ability to hold on!<eos> Amazing!<eos> Excellent grip.<eos> - Oh, my...!<eos> - And he makes it!<eos> He makes it!<eos> He does it!
After that run, Japan's Akio Shimofuji is now on the bubble.<eos> And up next is a competitor who's very lucky to be here.<eos> We're happy he is, but he barely qualified for Level 2.<eos> Trevor Carter from the United States.<eos> Trevor has to get past Coil Crawl to stay in this competition and knock Japan's Akio Shimofuji out.<eos> - Here we go, the Ejector!<eos> - Wow. I feel pride to be at the third level.<eos> I get to represent my hometown and my country, and I'm gonna fight.<eos> He has to find a way to make it to the second part.<eos> And he does it.
The course ticks me off when it gets the best of me!<eos> Adrian Raya of Mexico is now on the bubble, and Yunhwan Kim of South Korea has been eliminated.<eos> But we do have some good news.<eos> His younger brother, Yungyung Kim, has been cleared to go and will now be the sole competitor left to represent his family, as well as his country.<eos> Kim Yungyung! Kim Yungyung!<eos> Yungyung Kim comes into Level 2 with 60 points, and he'll need more than 100 to move on to Level 3.<eos> If he doesn't, Adrian Raya of Mexico will be moving on.<eos> He slams into the second platform.<eos> I mean, he hit that thing really hard.<eos> - Yeah, he does it.
But the Beast kicked back, and scored no points on Level 2.<eos> Everyone in Japan, I am sorry.<eos> Next up came South Korea's Woosung Yu.<eos> Now, he entered Level 2 with his hands bandaged after sliding down that rope in Level 1, where the Beast inflicted some serious palm-shredding burn.<eos> Oh, look at that, yeah.<eos> At the fourth jump, he aimed too low.<eos> Woosung Yu having great difficulty right now.<eos> The hands are hurting, look at them!<eos> And after struggling for over two minutes, South Korea's Wild Horse, he pulled off the impossible...<eos> And he does it!
One thing that's different about Level 1 this time around, Terry, is the Mag Wall has an opportunity for a Point Thruster.<eos> Look at this.<eos> He is sailing through this Mag Wall like Spider-Man.<eos> Crosses his hands, but very quickly.<eos> Is he gonna go for that Point Thruster?<eos> He'd better, because he is a five-time Brazilian climbing champion.<eos> This guy is made for the Mag Wall.<eos> He's got it! He's got it.<eos> He was one of our few competitors to finish Level 1 the first time, so can he do it again in the finals?<eos> And he did it!
This is interesting.<eos> Heeyong Park doesn't appear to be going for the Point Thruster, so he'll have to make it all the way to the last Energy Coil if he wants to knock out Steven Tucker.<eos> - There you go!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Whoa! That was precarious.<eos> He's relieved.<eos> Even he's shocked.<eos> And this is it.<eos> Steven Tucker's fate hangs on this last jump.<eos> He does it!
Get comfortable.<eos> Is he gonna go for that Point Thruster?<eos> You know he's going for that Point Thruster.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Heeyong Park don't mess around.<eos> - No, he doesn't!<eos> Grabs that thing, gets the points on the Point Thruster.<eos> Now he's just gotta get over to that platform, and he's sitting pretty!<eos> He's going to make it!<eos> He does it!
Look at him.<eos> He's like, "You know what?<eos> I got to sit down."<eos> He's made it further than he did the first time, which is so impressive, and now he's gotta get into Digestive Track.<eos> He's going in feet first.<eos> I don't think I've seen it done that way very much.<eos> This is a testament once again to this guy's unbelievable strength.<eos> Great technique.<eos> He's going to be up over the Dreadmill so he can jump down onto them, and there he goes!<eos> He does it!
So, a scientist really did survive.<eos> That's a Gravitational Beam Emitter, right?<eos> Quite an impressive gun.<eos> That's the one technology that even we couldn't re-create.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> I don't know about the gun.<eos> There are vestiges of the contagion in your irises.<eos> You... don't have the Net Terminal Gene.<eos> What sort of stupid thing is that to say?<eos> Of course I don't.
Not just the ones he raped.<eos> Here comes the kicker.<eos> You ready?<eos> Here's the fact that I heard, but haven't confirmed.<eos> I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for.<eos> So, you understand what I'm saying?<eos> The point is this:<eos> He rapes, but he saves.<eos> And he saves more than he rapes.<eos> But he probably does rape.
It's a secret you'll never admit to.<eos> Go.<eos> Up till now, Cat Adams has only worked solo.<eos> But this is a partnership.<eos> So we need to figure out how these two hit women were able to work together, especially when one of them was in solitary.<eos> And hit men are drive by profit and self-preservation.<eos> They don't take a job unless they know all the angles.<eos> So, to predict their behavior, we need to ask ourselves a simple question.<eos> We know why Cat wanted revenge on Reid.<eos> Why does Lindsey?
OH DEAR.<eos> NOW WHAT?<eos> I was never attracted to breasts, for example.<eos> Specifically in the girlfriends and women that were objects of my desire, breasts were not exactly special items to me.<eos> But at any time during sex, have you wished you had them?<eos> -Being in this other...<eos> -Ah, well, that I always had.<eos> No, but having breasts, having...<eos> Not wanting that person's breasts, but wanting breasts for yourself.<eos> Never very much. Clearly, I never did.
So, our approach was up those steps and right into this apartment.<eos> We spent maybe 45 minutes to an hour listening to Russell.<eos> And... since it was now three hours after what she expected, I said, "I think it's time for us to call the police."<eos> So, a single policeman responded to our call.<eos> He came to this apartment.<eos> We were describing her as a missing person.<eos> He wrote everything down, he left.<eos> The three of us gathered around a little table.<eos> And I said Mass.<eos> We did a little bread and wine, and I did the Mass, a consecration.
They're lying.<eos> Of course there was allegations.<eos> Question number three.<eos> "Were any disciplinary interventions made against Father Maskell prior to 1992?"<eos> The archdiocese's answer: "No."<eos> That's it, just "no"?<eos> This is disgusting.<eos> This is disgusting.<eos> He's saying nothing happened before me, so... And Charles is saying,<eos> "Oh, no, definitely, it did."
He made it sound like so much fun and he promised to go to jail right after the Bash.<eos> I believe my friend here could help in arresting these gentlemen.<eos> Oof, I don't know.<eos> That sounds like a lot of work.<eos> Okay, I could never say no to you.<eos> Come on, everybody.<eos> You'll all have to scooch into the back of my car. I hope that's okay.<eos> If it helps I could drive separately.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> Oh! Oh, no you don't.
I want back in the game, and since you're the reason I'm out of the game, you should hire me as a full-time in-house consultant.<eos> - So you want me to give you a handout out of guilt?<eos> - I don't want a handout.<eos> But you made me a promise you wouldn't ruin my reputation.<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> What you do is dangerous. - I want you to say you make promises you can't keep.<eos> And by the way, you wouldn't have sent that Rachel woman back to me if you didn't know<eos> - what I do is worth it. - Okay, first of all, I never sent anyone back to you.<eos> And second, whatever job you think you're suited for doesn't exist in my firm.<eos> - It does at Baker Simms and Walker Stein.
You started re-reading Jesus' miracles and you're like, "I know how to do that."<eos> Plexiglass under the water.<eos> You just break a fish up into a bunch of different pieces.<eos> - Or palming a fish.<eos> - Yeah, you palm a fish and...<eos> Oh, look what I have here.<eos> What was your first trick you learned?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> That's really private.<eos> No, I don't.
- News.<eos> Um, would you excuse us for just a second?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What did I tell you right before I left?<eos> Would you like a wafer?<eos> Bathroom.<eos> Oh, God. Do you have to go to the bathroom?<eos> You do.
That's Minami's.<eos> It's quite a tragedy that two people have died in the same house.<eos> I hate to do this now, Mr. Michima, but I have a few questions for you.<eos> What kind of work did Ms. Shirakawa do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you know anything about her family?<eos> I know nothing about them either.<eos> When Ms. Shirakawa was 20, her parents went missing.<eos> Did you know about that?<eos> You didn't?
Whilst Mary was weaving the veils for the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem, I studied with the Pharisees.<eos> Some of the best ones, too.<eos> And some maybe not so good.<eos> Like some of the students.<eos> Sometimes I amaze myself at what I might have done... Son?<eos> ...had I not gone off to Egypt.<eos> Son, are you all right?<eos> Your hand, it's very warm.<eos> Son! I think I could've been a prophet.<eos> Joseph, what do you...
I mean, I was in a hurry.<eos> I checked to see if we had gas.<eos> That was more important.<eos> So there is a body?<eos> Let Holtzmann check.<eos> She likes that type of stuff.<eos> Yeah, I can think of seven good uses of a cadaver today.<eos> No, Dr. Frankenstein, we got to turn in the body if there's one in there.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Don't do that.
We just got to let her ride it out until she's out of juice.<eos> She's corkscrewing me!<eos> Abby, I'll make some adjustments.<eos> It's like fighting a gator!<eos> Looking forward to this metal show.<eos> Hi.<eos> Ozzy rocks!<eos> Yeah!<eos> It's...<eos> He certainly does rock.
Climb on!<eos> Motherfucking...<eos> Motherfucker should have worn his brown pants.<eos> You were right, beautiful.<eos> Red really is my color.<eos> Wade?<eos> Don't worry, baby... I'mma get you out of that shit-box.<eos> What better way to crawl back inside that head of yours?<eos> Oh, you never left.<eos> But you did, asshole!
You guys are gonna help her out, right?<eos> She's DEA. Different team.<eos> -But she's making a difference.<eos> -She's making a mess.<eos> Why do you think we made the last DEA agent assigned here eat a C-4 sandwich?<eos> My parents died when I was a little boy.<eos> In many ways, El Toro has been like a father to me.<eos> Just as you will be to all of our people.<eos> This country needs a change.<eos> Yes, it does.
Now she's not fucked up by you yet.<eos> You don't even care!<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again. Hand over the child.<eos> She doesn't want her.<eos> Ask her.<eos> Ask her, right now.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.<eos> I do... Please.
I'll see you at trollstice, yeah?<eos> I miss you already.<eos> I think the king really likes us.<eos> I know, right?<eos> That was the greatest day of my life!<eos> Thanks, Poppy.<eos> Thanks to all of you!<eos> Even you, I guess.<eos> I just never thought something like that could happen to me.<eos> And it just did!
They would go out those doors happy instead of shitting themselves.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> So you're telling me you wrote the song?<eos> I can't take full credit.<eos> I wrote the music. Twink is my lyricist.<eos> We both drop it right and we drop it all the time.<eos> The melody came to me one night... when I was getting super, super, super baked.<eos> Like fuck-a-guy baked.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, he does.
Hello.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Is this the Yung Du Market?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Can I ask you a question?<eos> - What you buying?<eos> I'm not buying anything, ma'am.<eos> I just want to know if you've seen this woman.<eos> - No, I don't know. I don't know.<eos> - This woman, does she...
Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath!<eos> How are we gonna get over those walls?<eos> I'll tell you how.<eos> We're gonna fly.<eos> Remember, the goal is the castle.<eos> Get to the castle.<eos> Who wants to go first?<eos> - Over here!<eos> Me! Me!<eos> Me! - I do!
Not so rough.<eos> Hey!<eos> He's mine.<eos> Who is this man?<eos> A Chinese cop.<eos> Now get him!<eos> Hey, it's not honorable to fight girls.<eos> Then stop acting like one.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> You did not...
-Not quite.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I've done everything you've asked.<eos> I've mastered napping, sleeping in, hammocks, hot tubs.<eos> I am totally at one with my panda parts.<eos> Now why won't you show me?<eos> Because I don't know it!<eos> You what?<eos> I don't know it, okay?<eos> No one does.
More like five times.<eos> More booze has been drunk in the last 10 years than ever before.<eos> Because people don't wanna be told they can't do it.<eos> The same could be said of fornication.<eos> People want it, but don't want to be told they can't have it.<eos> Well, nor should they.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> If people want to fornicate, I see no reason to stop them.<eos> And if they wish to lie down with animals?<eos> Do they?
Why don't I stay here with Trev?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> There's one more thing.<eos> You know, over the years, Trevor's never become attached to any caregiver.<eos> I'm so pleased you two get on so well, but... you won't be here forever.<eos> I know about your son.<eos> You know, I wouldn't let you be with Trevor without first doing my due diligence.<eos> What do you know exactly?<eos> Everything.<eos> So does Trevor.
So far they ain't, but they will.<eos> And they're gonna make it here.<eos> So, just relax.<eos> Enjoy this little town.<eos> Do you wanna live here?<eos> Got an old hardware store that charges twice what home depot does, one restaurant with a rattlesnake for a waitress.<eos> I mean, how is anybody supposed to make a living here?<eos> People have made a living here for 150 years.<eos> Well, people lived in caves for 150,000 years.<eos> But they don't do it no more.

You asked to be taught.<eos> And clearly, there is much you need to learn.<eos> How long, teacher?<eos> Until the shadow moves from here to there.<eos> Twice.<eos> You learn quickly.<eos> That's good.<eos> Snow Vase.<eos> How do you know her?<eos> I do not.
Clean pliers.<eos> Sterilize them.<eos> Besides, we ain't living back then.<eos> All he had to do was go down to Doc Goldblum's.<eos> I see where you and that Tallahassee gal, that Alberta, see where you all done got tight.<eos> What you mean, "got tight"?<eos> I see where you be laughing and joking with her all the time.<eos> I laugh and joke with 'em all. Bono, you know me.<eos> Ain't the kind of laughing and joking I'm talking about.<eos> How you doing, Mr. Bono?
Ain't no explaining it.<eos> The fella that give me this quarter had a whole mess of 'em!<eos> I'm gonna keep this quarter till it stops shining.<eos> Gabe, go on up front now.<eos> I got some watermelon in the Frigidaire.<eos> Go on.<eos> I'll get you a piece.<eos> Say, Rose, you know, I was chasing hellhounds, and them bad men come and get me and take me away.<eos> He come down there and told them they better let me go before he beat them up!<eos> Yeah, he did!
We'll do it.<eos> Yeah, we'll totally hang.<eos> No big deal, buddy.<eos> All right, have a good one.<eos> Bye, Jimberly.<eos> You buzz me up, and I'll give you a free dance on the way down.<eos> How about that?<eos> I'll let you up.<eos> I like Gordon Lightfoot.<eos> Who doesn't?
Baby steps.<eos> I'm okay with that.<eos> I knew you were gonna change your mind.<eos> Because when we were talking, you looked at me, you were like...<eos> And I was like, "He's thinking about it." You were mulling it over.<eos> God damn, I'm pumped up.<eos> Okay, this is a little awkward, babe.<eos> James wants me to go away with him for a couple days on official police business.<eos> I don't wanna go.<eos> I don't.
No breach.<eos> The virus is completely contained.<eos> The virus is contained.<eos> All medical units, stand by. MAN 1:<eos> We'll take it from here, Dr. Sinskey.<eos> Target is contained and preparing for transport.<eos> Containment confirmed.<eos> I repeat, containment confirmed.<eos> She thought she was saving the world.<eos> So did they all.
Yeah.<eos> It was standing next to a little boy's bed.<eos> It was just gently touching his cheek and then it stopped. And it looked right at me.<eos> Of course, my mom and the nurses did not believe me, but I knew it was real.<eos> Look, I know how it is.<eos> I know what it's like to lose your friends because you're different.<eos> But I also know that one person can change everything.<eos> And you just have to open up to them.<eos> How did you know you could trust the people you opened up to?<eos> I didn't.
You okay?<eos> I don't think I am.<eos> You're a great mom.<eos> That kid up there... he needs a great mom.<eos> You need a kid.<eos> It's a perfect match.<eos> We don't need anything else.<eos> I know that you think you do.<eos> And God knows there's a big part of me it feels the same.<eos> But we don't.
We contain situations.<eos> We don't blow them up.<eos> There may be civilians involved.<eos> Who?<eos> Work with me.<eos> Then we'll find out.<eos> We're done here.<eos> So, you know Lars?<eos> Nah, not really.<eos> My daughter does though.
You all right?<eos> Where's Naz?<eos> What?<eos> So, who's "he" in the sentence "he kill her or something"?<eos> Uh, look, man, I was just saying.<eos> You were just saying what?<eos> I mean, you know, some Arab dude she was with.<eos> Describe him.<eos> You know, an Arab dude.<eos> No, I don't.
I mean, I tried to warn her, too. Yeah?<eos> How'd you go about doing that?<eos> I just told him right to his face.<eos> But you didn't know him.<eos> Nope.<eos> Never saw him before.<eos> Nope, nope.<eos> You know the girl?<eos> I mean, not per se, you know what I'm saying?<eos> No, I don't.
We are followers.<eos> We follow to find out.<eos> I think he is preparing us.<eos> For what?<eos> Down.<eos> Pilate will not let this rest.<eos> I bring danger to you all.<eos> They have a tracker.<eos> They can't know we're up here.<eos> They already do.
Over here!<eos> Because you were thoughtful You have overcome so many obstacles for me. Just so I can be reborn<eos> I am so grateful.<eos> I agree to kiss you.<eos> I don't want that.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I don't like to start out with kissing.<eos> Because you won't learn anything.<eos> I want to start from here. Travel down from your stomach and kiss down there first. A hard kiss.<eos> Then do it.
- I can get you leave.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> Then you can work reduced hours.<eos> Everyone will understand, Mads.<eos> - Hi, Mom!<eos> - Hi, sweetie.<eos> All right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did you buy sushi?<eos> - Of course I did.
Not like white guy dancing, but dancing for real.<eos> It's like a piece of self in my body, it just feels like it's in the right place, you know, it's like... it's like...<eos> It's like I'm fucking hallucinating reality.<eos> Reality's perfect, reality's perfect.<eos> I'm glad that you reached nirvana 'cause I don't feel shit.<eos> - What? - What a crazy fucking night.<eos> - I'm in heaven.<eos> - God, I feel amazing.<eos> Hey, hey, he's not feeling anything.<eos> - I don't... - What?
Let me tell you this before I tell you that.<eos> Most lawyers charge by the hour.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's to their benefit.<eos> Every phone call, email, meeting, motion, delay, every note jotted down on every Post-it, the meter's running.<eos> With a murder, that could easily run $150,000.<eos> Now, I'm not gonna do that to you.<eos> I'm charging a flat fee.<eos> $75,000 if it goes to trial, and half of that if it doesn't.<eos> If it doesn't what?
We got them cornered.<eos> Turn here and stop.<eos> Do we just wait here?<eos> No, they'll have units on the ground.<eos> They're gonna be all over us.<eos> We all better figure it out fast 'cause I don't like it here.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> There was no way they could've known we'd be in this van.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> They did.
"Wherever you go, I go, too."<eos> That's what you said.<eos> I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.<eos> That's all I want-- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you'll be safe.<eos> Us and everyone else in the world.<eos> I don't care about them.<eos> Well, no, I do, but I don't really.<eos> I care about you and him.<eos> I know that, Sam.<eos> And he does, too.
Mr. Khan, is that your understanding?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - All right.<eos> You're gonna be asked a series of questions by the district attorney.<eos> If at any time you don't understand what's being asked of you or you have any need for clarification, feel free to interrupt and ask any question, okay? - Okay.<eos> - Defendant, please rise.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth,<eos> - and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
And what if Alex dies in your care?<eos> Huh? What's to stop that evil bastard brother of his sending you into the next world after him?<eos> Murtagh could go with me.<eos> Here, on yer feet, ye lazy swine. What?<eos> Would ye be so kind as to tell me what the MacKenzie's doing here?<eos> If I knew, I would.<eos> It's good to see some familiar faces.<eos> I was sorry to hear about Angus' death.<eos> I always thought when that wee bastard fell, that you would fall with him.<eos> So did I.
You like my Biggie photo?<eos> Me, too.<eos> You know what draws your eye when you look at that?<eos> The crown.<eos> Wanna know why?<eos> 'Cause everybody wants to be the king.<eos> I slapped you like a little bitch.<eos> I'm not the kind of man to use a closed fist on a woman.<eos> Where's my money?<eos> I... I didn't...
You have any idea what it's like to hear everyone's thoughts, night and day?<eos> All the pettiness, misery, cruelty, huh?<eos> I have created a place here where everyone's happy.<eos> - They all appreciate me.<eos> - They don't have a choice.<eos> I have been given an opportunity to do something good, to save humanity.<eos> You sound like my mother.<eos> I have given us all a purpose.<eos> All of us, we play a role in preserving the future, and you should understand that.<eos> - No, I don't. - Yeah.
Druid?<eos> You said the last Druid died in the War of the Races.<eos> Did you now?<eos> No one has set eyes on you in 30 years.<eos> I assumed the worst... but it appears you have not aged a single day.<eos> I have been called by the Ellcrys.<eos> I must go to the Sanctuary immediately.<eos> If you really are a Druid... prove it.<eos> Show us some magic.<eos> I don't do tricks.
Eureka!<eos> - This is yours, sister-in-law.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> I know where it came from.<eos> The robbery at the Chinese restaurant.<eos> I don't want a penny from the bastard who killed Antonio.<eos> What?<eos> You're a little tipsy, let's save the wine for later.<eos> He didn't tell you?<eos> No, he didn't.
Wordy, I know.<eos> You have a name for this plan?<eos> "Yashiori" after the legendary saké that felled a hydra.<eos> Very well.<eos> We'll run this op in five phases.<eos> Akasaka worked out the details.<eos> Requested vehicles have all been prepped. Plus explosives drills have been conducted and quite successfully, I might add.<eos> Forces are execution-ready.<eos> I owe you thanks.<eos> No, you don't.
We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.<eos> And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations.<eos> As commander of the Unsullied, he knows how to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace.<eos> You have made peace with the slavers?<eos> We offered terms.<eos> - Do not use me for your lies.<eos> - Those men respect you.<eos> They respect me because they know who I am.<eos> - They know I am loyal.<eos> - As do I.
What's left for you here?<eos> You wouldn't be safe.<eos> Not while she's looking for me.<eos> Who?<eos> She doesn't have a name.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Essos is east and Westeros is west.<eos> But what's west of Westeros?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation?<eos> It's not.<eos> You understand.<eos> On some level you understand that you're an evil man.<eos> I'll leave the judgments to the gods.<eos> Well, that is convenient for you.<eos> You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?<eos> Your square jaw, your golden armor.<eos> Tell me, I want to know.<eos> I truly do.
Fred, put the siren on.<eos> Get me to the Port Committee, quick!<eos> Regional Prefect?<eos> I believe the port should be modernized so I'm in favor of the sale.<eos> - Development Minister?<eos> - In favor.<eos> And the representative for the Minister of Finance?<eos> In favor.<eos> You don't want a casino?<eos> No, we don't.
But seriously, I have something I need to tell you.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - Go for it, Dad.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - Yes. What is it?<eos> I'm making these bacon rolls real greasy, Dad.<eos> Bullshit artist.<eos> Am not.<eos> Bullshit. You make this the greasiest feast since that goose you cooked on Christmas.<eos> Done and done, Dad.
- Really beautiful evening. - Nice to see you. - Nice to meet you.<eos> - See you Monday.<eos> - You too. 'Night.<eos> Can't sleep?<eos> I'm still wound up from the excitement.<eos> Yeah, we all are.<eos> I had a really good time tonight.<eos> I really liked seeing you and Dad happy together.<eos> Do you think that seeing you all over the internet like that makes me happy?<eos> Do you?
"She fought the monster and killed it "and cut off its head and went galumphing back.<eos> "And the woman...<eos> "The woman said,<eos> "'You are my special girl. You will always be with me<eos> "'and I'll never, never let you go.' "And they lived... They lived happily together ever after."<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can I try again?<eos> Can I try again, please?<eos> No! No fucking way!<eos> No. - I didn't...
Marks.<eos> Shit. We gotta call Vegas Metro.<eos> No! No.<eos> No fuckin' police. - They said no police.<eos> - They always say that.<eos> Look, until I know what I'm dealing with, I'm not taking any chances.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> This isn't our town.<eos> We don't even know where to begin.<eos> I do.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Step right up and get your tickets for the freak show.<eos> Who do you think would make more money in a freak show?<eos> Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?<eos> I'd go with Toothless.<eos> I told you a million times, my teeth are coming in.<eos> It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.<eos> "I told you a million times."<eos> --Do the arm thing.<eos> Do it, freak!
Yeah, the neighbors might see.<eos> This is so stupid.<eos> I'm just gonna drop you off.<eos> Calm down, Barb.<eos> Come on.<eos> You promised that you'd go.<eos> You're coming.<eos> We're gonna have a great time.<eos> He just wants to get in your pants.<eos> No, he doesn't.
--Guys!<eos> It's Lucas, I think he's in trouble.<eos> Do you remember how he said he was looking for the gate?<eos> - Yeah. - What if he found it?<eos> What's he saying?<eos> I don't know, he's way out of range.<eos> ...son of a bitch! Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.<eos> We can't understand you.<eos> Yes, I copy!<eos> Do you?
Hanging in there?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Three words.<eos> Same old, right.<eos> Always these... two or three-word answers.<eos> Like on your postcards.<eos> Or that little smile.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Did they talk to you?<eos> Suzanne just did, right?
Stop it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Go back.<eos> Go back.<eos> Go.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> You can't die.<eos> I can.<eos> Jarrod, the Ilythia Clinic doesn't exist.<eos> Of course it does.
Mildred?<eos> Yes?<eos> Would you marry me?<eos> Garnet, come.<eos> He said he'd bought the whole acre for me.<eos> And then he asked me to marry him.<eos> - No he didn't!<eos> - Yes. - Right out in the field? - Uh-huh.<eos> Oh, Lord, that man might be crazy.<eos> Well, when you gonna do it?
You hesitated, because you couldn't remember.<eos> Yeah. I thought I'd ruined it.<eos> I don't know how many I've killed.<eos> Or assisted in killing.<eos> I don't know anymore.<eos> What you saw in that video, that is my job.<eos> I have called in air strikes, bombed villages, I've...<eos> Thrown grenades into houses.<eos> How does that feel?<eos> It doesn't.
Bye!<eos> - Merry Christmas!<eos> - Okay.<eos> There they go.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> - What?<eos> I need to tell them the truth.<eos> No, you don't. Let it go.<eos> - They need to know.<eos> - No, they don't. - Robert.
I...<eos> I was supposed to... my dad by the time he was my age, he had a master's degree and, like, five medals from the Navy.<eos> And I get coffee.<eos> You do more than that, Clark.<eos> Yeah, sometimes I get donuts.<eos> I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street.<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.
Oh, um, I'm glad you kept your job.<eos> I'll see you in class.<eos> Prepare for a long day and tough questions.<eos> You will take the stand to defend your case as an FBI agent.<eos> Welcome to our courtroom.<eos> Trainee Chang, how are we supposed to believe that our client killed his sister when you haven't even produced a body?<eos> Because the circumstantial evidence is enough for a murder conviction, assuming that we have excluded all reasonable hypotheses.<eos> Have you?<eos> The FBI believes that it has.<eos> I, on the other hand, do not.
Your key.<eos> Room 210.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No good. No, prime. No.<eos> He needs a prime number.<eos> - Something like 607. - No, really, that's fine.<eos> Don't need a prime number.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Yes... no, we do.
Doesn't look good.<eos> I thought you said this guy was the best.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, he is.<eos> That's why he's so damn expensive.<eos> Well, I want to meet this guy, man.<eos> Enough of this fucking middle man shit.<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> No problem. I'll just, uh, I'll just him on the phone here.<eos> Of course, it's going to cost you 100 bucks whether he picks up or not.<eos> 200 if he does.
There's, uh, a special on hot chicken and hot turkey sandwiches all afternoon! Whoo!<eos> All right then.<eos> Chicken sandwich just got a bigger cheer than I did.<eos> Okay. Just hang on here.<eos> How do you make this thing... (Drum beat playing)<eos> That's a nice country beat there.<eos> Okay, let's get clapping.<eos> (Ukulele ♪♪) Here we go!<eos> ♪ Who likes chicken?<eos> Well, I do ♪
Uh, I just stopped by to make sure that you weren't destroying my park before I get it back, Julian.<eos> Randy, what the fuck?<eos> I told them they weren't allowed in the park, Julian, but this bitch almost ran me over.<eos> Hey, hey! What did you just call me?<eos> Whatever the frig I want to call you.<eos> Pffft! I'm sick of getting pushed around by you three bitches!<eos> 'kay, Randy, what you going to do about it?<eos> Do you want a fucking piece of this?<eos> Well, maybe I do.<eos> Julian: No, he doesn't.
Bet you didn't think we'd be breaking the law together when you arrested me on the Ark, huh?<eos> This isn't a game, Nate.<eos> If we don't find out what Pike's up to, more people will die.<eos> Then let's not get caught.<eos> Chancellor Pike, good to see you.<eos> Hey, you put it somewhere smart, out of sight.<eos> I'll buy you some time.<eos> There you are.<eos> We need to talk about these things Jaha's distributing.<eos> No, we don't.
- Ooh, cool!<eos> A player piano.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> That's playing on its own.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> That's Irma.<eos> She's, like, the resident piano-playing ghost.<eos> Hey, let's go stalk that, uh, super excited lady.<eos> No, you should ask her to play a song.<eos> - She does anything.
He saw only men, weak men, and gave succor.<eos> He saw suffering, which he sought to ease.<eos> He saw sin, and gave love.<eos> Love, Autolochus?<eos> He saw my own sin, Gracchus, and greed.<eos> But in his eyes, I saw no shadow of reproach.<eos> I saw only light.<eos> The light of God.<eos> You mean, of the gods.<eos> I do not, friend Gracchus.
Look, guys, we're on your fucking side here.<eos> I tried to tackle the fat guy.<eos> He slipped through my arms like a fucking oiled-up seal. I just really need to find this fucking dog.<eos> Please. Like, I love this thing more than anything.<eos> It's fucking killing me right now.<eos> Policeman: Will you put out an APB on two Bamp; E suspects running through the woods near Colby Village South.<eos> One's a bigger guy, no shirt on, purple tits.<eos> Uh, the other guy's wearing khaki clothes, bald, and may have pissed himself.<eos> Repeat: may have pissed himself.<eos> He did, for sure.
Know anything about the break-in down at The Denture King?<eos> (Scoffing) I've been here all day, man.<eos> Pretty funny actually, because whoever took the safe didn't realize it was empty.<eos> I bet the look your face was priceless.<eos> You mean the look on the person that took the safe's face.<eos> I wasn't there, Ted!<eos> (Sigh) Sorry... sorry, sorry...<eos> Why the fuck not?<eos> Because I'm not getting paid enough to do the... (Engine ignition) the things that they want me to do to them to keep them out.<eos> Do what things to them?
Come on. All right.<eos> Yeah. Come on. This way.<eos> Okay. All right, come here.<eos> Baby, shh. Shh.<eos> Okay.<eos> That went clean through.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Baby, I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, come on, this ain't your fault. It ain't your fault.<eos> How you doing?
Honeypot.<eos> They're in trouble.<eos> Stay here.<eos> - I'm going with you. - I said stay here.<eos> No.<eos> Damn it, Maggie.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Yes, I do.
I can't.<eos> - Daryl.<eos> - Man, I can't!<eos> I can't either.<eos> Thing is, those men could be back in Alexandria right now.<eos> If they are, they're dead.<eos> I hope not.<eos> We need them alive.<eos> We need to find out more.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Previously in "The 100"...<eos> Let the people know they have a new Commander.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> - No one knows that.<eos> - He does.
Bruce. Hi. Karen Grisham had lunch with you<eos> You're friends with an inside joke.<eos> Could we have a discussion about that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> So, what else did she say?<eos> And don't leave out a single thing, okay?<eos> Well, uh, she says we're BFFs.<eos> I think she wants to represent you.<eos> Oh, no, she doesn't.
Your Honor, I have one final witness to call.<eos> Grace Wesley.<eos> Ms. Wesley, please approach the witness stand.<eos> Do I have to?<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> Your Honor, given the witness's reluctance to testify, can I have the court's permission to treat her as a hostile witness?<eos> You may.<eos> Proceed at your own peril.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
How are you so comfortable mocking me?<eos> Ariq plotted with our enemies, endangered the life of your heir.<eos> He deserved to die.<eos> Kaidu challenged your rule under the laws of our land.<eos> You cannot cut off his head.<eos> If you do, the legitimacy of your Khanate will forever be in question.<eos> Your people will wonder why the great Kublai Khan was so afraid to let their voices be heard.<eos> - I'm not afraid.<eos> - I know that.<eos> Once again, they do not.
They're not gonna look good on camera.<eos> They'll be fine. They're not gonna be fine.<eos> Hi, so, um... who was asking for the kill list?<eos> That would be me.<eos> It was you.<eos> Awesome.<eos> - You're fired.<eos> - Hey. That's my focus puller.<eos> You can't fire him.<eos> And yet, I just did.
Let's try these eyelashes.<eos> Okay, no. Really.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's enough. No, no... that's not even close to enough.<eos> Look. You want to skip the lashes?<eos> Fine, whatever.<eos> But I'm telling you, they would change your life.<eos> Okay. Ruby. Look, I know you don't want to hear it, but you know who doesn't win this thing?<eos> Rosa Parks.<eos> And who does?
Oh, my God.<eos> You're screwing her.<eos> I kissed her once.<eos> Chet, seriously, you kissed her?<eos> !<eos> That's so much worse! [ Groans ]<eos> Last night might have been just a little too fast, okay?<eos> I'm sorry I took advantage of you like that. "Took advantage"?<eos> Darius, no.<eos> You didn't.
We've all made sacrifices.<eos> But can't you see that this mission, stopping Savage, is bigger than any one of us?<eos> I am so sick of you using that tone.<eos> When are you gonna learn you are not my father?<eos> I'm sorry you lost him at such a tender age, but if your father were here, right now, he'd be saying what I'm saying.<eos> Just grow up, Jefferson.<eos> The future of the world is at stake, and if you insist on getting yourself killed, as terrible as that might be for your mother, or me, who, incidentally, would also die,<eos> I am more concerned with the billions of people who will die because of your... arrogant adolescent ego!<eos> Okay.<eos> Please don't... don't...
It's just that I heard about Geronimo and I want to help you with your telescope.<eos> Shh! Get it.<eos> Get in.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> Does it work?<eos> No. Not unless I can find a high-quality lens or learn how to make one.<eos> I think I can get one for you.<eos> You can get a telescope lens?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - No, you do not. Hmm.
What?<eos> Hand me the blanket, Miss.<eos> Why?<eos> You're not supposed to have it.<eos> Hand me the blanket, Miss.<eos> No.<eos> - Miss.<eos> - I'll die.<eos> You won't.<eos> No one does.
It's a mental and physical break, a disassociation with your bodily functions, something like a coma.<eos> When will it end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> You just do!
You hear me?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> That's what the prosecutor is looking for.<eos> Your desperation.<eos> And look how easy it was to provoke it.<eos> Do you want to insult me? Go ahead.<eos> That's also what the prosecutor is looking for. That the arrogant idiot that is inside comes out.<eos> Enough!<eos> Are you are not here to defend me?<eos> Then, do it.
Everything has unfolded according to Providence.<eos> What do you think is under there anyway?<eos> Power, Mr. Queen.<eos> I'm glad you have recuperated.<eos> We have much to accomplish together.<eos> Reiter's pet.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I know you killed Vlad.<eos> I watched.<eos> We all did.
Well, you better hope that they don't find Mr. Queen and Mr. Diggle before you do, Malcolm, or I'll be forced to seriously question what your purpose here is.<eos> Every time I knock down a firewall, 5 more pop back up.<eos> It would seem that Mr. Darhk has a counter-hacker in his employ.<eos> And he's good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ok. I might have something.<eos> Now, until the FBI gets their way, smartphones are protected by encryption.<eos> If you don't enter your passcode after enough times, then the device bricks itself, right?<eos> Curtis, I don't even have the time to tell you that I don't have the time.<eos> You just did.
I can only fix one of your mistakes at a time.<eos> Let's get on with it.<eos> 1944, here I come.<eos> The target is the Mission Cross Mental Asylum.<eos> We'll put you as close as we can to the 600 block of Oak Ridge Terrace, Jersey City.<eos> That's where we lost the tether.<eos> It's up to you, Mr. Ramse.<eos> Initiate Spencer sequence.<eos> You can take off the masks.<eos> No virus did this.
I don't know.<eos> You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.<eos> [man] Your last attempt at a comeback was The BoJack Horseman Show.<eos> Pass.<eos> [man 2] People still see you as the guy from that sucky show from the '90s.<eos> Horsin' Around was not a sucky show.<eos> - Yeah, but it was.<eos> - It lasted nine seasons.<eos> Its whole purpose was for people to watch it so the network could sell ad time, so the show could make more money than it cost to produce.<eos> It did that well.
You know? She knows that I visit her often enough.<eos> And I... I'm very sorry, Father, but if I had known that today was...<eos> Father, why don't you take Thomas?<eos> Yes, that's a wonderful idea.<eos> "Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arm, quite vanquished him, then burst his mighty heart."<eos> Get him dressed.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Did you bring me breakfast?<eos> - Christ!<eos> Did you? Here.
You trusted me then.<eos> Circumstances have changed, all right?<eos> - Things are different now, D. - No.<eos> We've always protected each other.<eos> When you had me shunned, I was furious. But now...<eos> I get it.<eos> You'll always protect me, no matter what.<eos> Even if I hate you for it.<eos> You deserve to be free of Klaus.<eos> We all do.
Son.<eos> I miss you so much, I had so much to talk to you.<eos> I did not even have time to talk, I love you.<eos> So much... in my teens I want to share with you.<eos> Son, don't worry.<eos> We'll be together and here you can be whatever you want.<eos> Never give up, the important thing is not where the soul goes but how it returns, is not it?<eos> Who told you that, son? Huh?<eos> What's it?<eos> - You did.
[horn honks]<eos> [music blares from truck]<eos> [music stops]<eos> [Tyler] Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> You drove right past me.<eos> You didn't say anything.<eos> I screamed.<eos> You didn't scream very loud.<eos> Yes, I did.
I need a man who's not afraid to introduce me to his friends.<eos> I need a man who's not ashamed to hold my hand in public.<eos> I'm trying, Tyler!<eos> I just don't want to jeopardize my retirement.<eos> "My retirement." I know, Jay.<eos> I heard you, but...<eos> What's next? Huh?<eos> What's the next excuse, Jay?<eos> Either you love me and you want the world to know it.<eos> Or you don't.
- Oh, Jesus.<eos> - You having a good day?<eos> We're looking for a customer.<eos> - What?<eos> - Wears a jacket... even in the middle of summer, or so they say.<eos> I... I mean...<eos> Now, I count two ankles, two knees, one elbow.<eos> And guess what?<eos> I got five more rounds.<eos> I don't...
Look, you got any idea what a scout sniper is? - You ever heard of that?<eos> No? - No.<eos> Okay, well, you're looking at one.<eos> My class in Quantico was class 307.<eos> And we had a... a motto. It was a saying, yeah?<eos> It was, "One shot, one kill."<eos> The point is, if I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.<eos> Why... why am I here?<eos> Why did you ask me to stay?<eos> I don't...
I'd already made a deal with the rest of the guards.<eos> I doubled the cut that Dutton was paying them.<eos> But that didn't work out, did it?<eos> No, I was wrong.<eos> That's difficult to admit, but... you have a gift, Mr. Castle.<eos> I assumed that the stories that I read in the paper about your attacks on the criminal world were apocryphal.<eos> How could one man be capable of such... violence?<eos> But then I saw it... with my own two eyes.<eos> And when one comes across someone with such talent... with such a gift... well... you don't let that go to waste.<eos> No, you don't.
Just turned 22.<eos> She went missing catering a Players' Club event.<eos> Players' Club?<eos> It's one of those skeezy pickup artist groups.<eos> You know, that teach geeks how to be sex gods.<eos> Got it.<eos> Lindsay was last seen talking to the lead scumbag.<eos> The founder, Carver Cruz.<eos> So he was interrogated?<eos> Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking.
This was her first gig with me.<eos> She didn't even know if she could do it.<eos> But I told her... I told her it was just like acting.<eos> Besides, who doesn't want to sleep with Ty Huntley?<eos> I thought Ty's agent hired Ali to sleep with him.<eos> He hired me for a number three special: blackmail.<eos> Slip him a roofie, get naked, whip out a selfie stick, and voilà.<eos> Why would he have any desire to blackmail his own star client, a client he's all about protecting?<eos> Ty's agent told you that Debra killed Ali.<eos> He did, yeah.
Come in. Hurry up.<eos> Here you have the septate uterus, characterized by its long horns and gradual narrowing toward the fallopian tubes.<eos> Too small.<eos> No way you're having that.<eos> If you'd spoken up, I wouldn't have had to eat it.<eos> Let it go!<eos> It was that or you were a reject.<eos> It's your life!<eos> I shouldn't have helped.<eos> You didn't!
Daewon?<eos> He's not here.<eos> Look around. My guy traced the IP address back here... this morning.<eos> You, my friend, look like someone who works very hard, huh?<eos> Maybe you should have a little fun.<eos> - Please, take Karina.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I said don't do that!<eos> Don't do that.
What is wrong with you?<eos> - Your whore daughter.<eos> - Hey...<eos> I'll knock your teeth in, you glittery cunt.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You need to get out of here now!<eos> I tr...<eos> I tried to do the right thing.<eos> You always do.
He knew that shit before we came to his house like some chumps holding swimming trunks.<eos> He wants to know why you.<eos> He wants to know your personal story.<eos> Nick:<eos> Well, I can tell him about microfinancing and NGOs.<eos> I can't imagine he wants to hear that.<eos> He definitely doesn't.<eos> I mean, you guys don't wanna hear that.<eos> Try and tell you guys... Izzy:<eos> I don't.
This came in the mail for you today.<eos> From Uncle Jackson.<eos> Whoa! Is that a hybrid spike?<eos> Yes, but I'm sure all the venom has been cleaned off.<eos> Although it is an inappropriate gift for a ten-year-old.<eos> Abraham.<eos> I'll be there in a minute.<eos> Okay.<eos> We know each other, don't we?<eos> We once did.
Yeah, it's my trip.<eos> My rules.<eos> You can cry if you want to.<eos> Okay, no.<eos> Just take it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Hey, what are you doing...<eos> Hold on.<eos> But I need my laptop.<eos> No, you don't.
I just wanted to be in charge, but what they don't tell you is that, once you're in charge, there's all this other, like, blah-bleh-bleh-bleh-bleh, top secret, bleh.<eos> You know what? They can't arrest me.<eos> Like, we're gonna go kill the rest of those body-swapping guys, and it's all, like, top secret, so it's off of books, and all I had to do was write, like, an e-mail.<eos> And then we're gonna go get the, uh, the psychics, too... all the ones that you've been tracking and more.<eos> And they wouldn't let Riggins do it, I guess, but they like me... more... better, because they gave me $80 million.<eos> We have to kill everybody who knows about it.<eos> So... I guess I got to kill you, too.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't have to do that.<eos> You don't, uh...
How's that?<eos> I feel like this warrants it.<eos> Who this?<eos> - I'm leaving.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on. Don't do that.<eos> Don't do that.
Hey, Noah, it's me. Emma! You guys are about to hit<eos> "Ten Most Wanted" territory if you don't watch out.<eos> What-What happened? It was terrible.<eos> Hey, look, have you... have you talked to Brooke?<eos> Uh, she's right here.<eos> (CLEARS THROAT) Hey.<eos> I...<eos> I'm so sorry about your dad.<eos> Brooke, you have to believe us.<eos> We didn't...
He was with the hostages who were shot.<eos> He managed to save many Jewish children by crossing the Swiss border.<eos> Léna has kept in touch with his son.<eos> You alright?<eos> Léo Glaeser was a resistant.<eos> Touvier will say that's why he arrested him.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> If we don't find an anti-Semitic intention, Touvier could get away once again.<eos> The execution will prove to be a war crime. His lawyers will play on the prescription.<eos> What about what he did in the synagogue?
- Thank you for wanting to meet me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> You're paranoid about Nico's party?<eos> Yes.<eos> Don't be.<eos> You were just sweet.<eos> Do you know if I slept with William?<eos> No.<eos> You don't know.<eos> No, you didn't.
They've got a whole team of investigators following Grace now.<eos> Why are they gunning for her so hard?<eos> They must have something on her that we don't know about.<eos> I'm all over my Scotland Yard sources, I haven't heard anything.<eos> Did you do a line while I was in the shower?<eos> I was up all night.<eos> I needed something, or I'll never finish these paintings in time.<eos> You need to keep a clear head.<eos> Now more than ever.<eos> We both do.
Okay. The cat is out of the bag.<eos> I am taking a leave of absence from CatCo.<eos> What? I've just done all there is that I can do here.<eos> I'm like a shark in a tank, and I'm swimming around in circles and I'm moving, but I'm not getting anywhere.<eos> And yes, yes. I've created a media empire and... I'd like to think that I spread some light in humanity out there in the world.<eos> But... I've just been swimming in the same pool for too long.<eos> There are new seas out there that I have to go conquer.<eos> Hmm. I need to dive.<eos> Everything is changing so fast.<eos> I do not do well with change.
I mean, we were pretty strange, remember?<eos> We had our own imaginary kingdom.<eos> You and Eddie made it up.<eos> And you were the kings, both of you.<eos> And the card game that never ended.<eos> What's that?<eos> Well, me and Eddie started playing cards one day... Uh, War, and this one game just... went on and on.<eos> There was no winner. So, um, we picked it up the next day and the next.<eos> And after a while, I think we just wanted to see how long it would go on.<eos> How long did it?
Are they in some kind of trouble?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you're making it easy on me.<eos> They're all in the same class. I'll have Mrs. Booth hold them after the last bell.<eos> You know it's not really him, right?<eos> Can I talk to Lily?<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Do you know who made it?<eos> Do you...
- Nice bangs.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And look who's back from Hawaii.<eos> Oh, what was it like playing with the Honolulu Phil? - Dreamy.<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Oh, great cameo.<eos> Loved you flailing around on stage.<eos> - You saw that?<eos> - The whole world did, sweetie.
Sorry.<eos> I knew I ate too many cakes.<eos> -Here you go.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> We got some information that he was dealing drugs.<eos> Drugs that came from here.<eos> Does this business have something to do with his death?<eos> You don't sound too surprised.<eos> Are you saying that you knew he was thieving drugs?<eos> Uh, yes. We did.
They're just vibrations of energy.<eos> You think the world is so solid, and then it melts.<eos> Good God, I'm drunk.<eos> Wanna go upstairs? Split a $10 Toblerone?<eos> Diabetic.<eos> Liar.<eos> Is that for me?<eos> It's for the Belgian ambassador.<eos> They always say it's going to rain when it's hot, when the air gets thick, and you want it to rain, a deep, cleansing rain that knocks the dirt out of the sky and leaves everything clear,<eos> but it never really does.
Laura?<eos> No, no, no no!<eos> - Uncle Frank!<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> Don't breathe!<eos> Hold your breath!<eos> No!<eos> - John, Emily, don't breathe!<eos> - Uncle Frank! No!<eos> No! Don't...
And Mike, if you're staying in here for me, don't do it.<eos> God, I can't wait to see you.<eos> I can't wait to see you either.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I, um--I just wanted to talk to you about my death row client.<eos> How can I help?<eos> They offered us a deal for him to get out in five years, and Jessica wants to take it.<eos> But I want to fight for him.<eos> Let me guess, she wants to present a united front.<eos> She does.
They shouldn't see their father as a criminal.<eos> Kevin, come on, man.<eos> I know it's hard on them.<eos> It tears me up every single day that I'm here.<eos> But they're kids.<eos> They're resilient.<eos> Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure.<eos> Well, Mike, you don't have kids.<eos> So you don't know.<eos> No. I don't.
Who would?<eos> It's just--I'm just saying she's not you.<eos> - Who is?<eos> - Nobody.<eos> Was this the kind of thing you're looking for?<eos> Oh, my God, it's perfect.<eos> Is it still available?<eos> - An offer went in this morning.<eos> - We have to beat it.<eos> No, Louis, we don't.
You want him to start sweating, but why?<eos> Because when people start sweating, they start talking to their lawyer.<eos> I'll tell Ray to be on hold.<eos> No, tell him to pull around.<eos> But you just said you weren't going to Sutter's.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm going somewhere else.<eos> Oh, look who it is, the man of the hour.<eos> - Did you get my indictments?<eos> - I sure as hell did.
I need you to get him out of solitary.<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> I can't do that That's bullshit.<eos> You switched into my cell the first night and ever since, you've been bragging about everything that you can do in here, so how about you stop telling me that you can't do it, and just tell me whether or not you will.<eos> All right, Mikey.<eos> I'll get your ticket to freedom out of solitary for you.<eos> But if you get out of here and I don't, you should know, I can get to you just as easily out there as I can in here.<eos> And when I say "get to you," you got to remember what I did to make Harvey put me away in the first place.<eos> Do you want to talk about what happened at the prison?<eos> No, Rachel, I don't.
Welcome to Danbury, Sean.<eos> You know you're taking a big risk that someone's gonna recognize me and figure out that you're up to something.<eos> Well, I'd be taking an even bigger risk if I didn't hand this to you personally.<eos> You're not gonna weasel out of my deal again.<eos> What is this?<eos> That is an iron clad agreement between your office and Jill Miller.<eos> You're representing Jill Miller now?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Does she know that you're not a lawyer?<eos> She does.
- Which one of you's the freak? - Come on, let's go.<eos> Hey, stop.<eos> Fitz, we could really use that exit.<eos> If I release the door, all the doors in cellblock A open.<eos> - The s-security wings, the exterior exits...<eos> Go, go!<eos> I get it.<eos> You and Phil Coulson are close.<eos> I'm the new Director, your boss, so you think there are things that I don't need to know.<eos> But I do.
Quake was here the entire time.<eos> But she was not responsible for the danger here today.<eos> Agent Johnson... saved us all.<eos> Just go with it.<eos> You'll thank me later.<eos> We need to get this to Gabe.<eos> Belongs to him now.<eos> I wouldn't count out the previous owner just yet.<eos> You think Robbie will make it back?<eos> The last Ghost Rider did.
I know it's not much, but the price is right.<eos> You just have to agree to keep the common areas clean, and do some small repairs for the residents.<eos> So, um, the landlord know about my record, right?<eos> That I'm on parole?<eos> Yeah. He does.
We got to get proof, something solid that -- so it's not his word against ours, like you said.<eos> Yeah, well, he's running a business, so there's got to be data somewhere.<eos> Laptop would be my guess. That, or some kind of device, anyway, something that he wouldn't risk going anywhere without.<eos> Crown Vic's an easy car to break into.<eos> Pop the taillight with a screwdriver gets you access to the trunk.<eos> Hand drill gets you into the back seat.<eos> Take a thumb drive, download whatever files he's got -- records, money transfers, pictures, videos.<eos> Worth a shot.<eos> When?<eos> When do we do this?
That would kill me. And I want him.<eos> I know he's not perfect.<eos> I know he's broken inside, but I can fix all that.<eos> He's not just broken, Celia.<eos> He's got a congenital defect in his aorta.<eos> It's inoperable.<eos> One of these days, his heart's just going to explode.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know about that.<eos> Everybody does.
Rahjon?<eos> Rajon?<eos> Ra-John?<eos> - Roll. Roll the Rs.<eos> - Rowjohn?<eos> Rojon? Rrrrr.<eos> R-R-Rojohn. Rojohn.<eos> Look, every person on a crew has a role.<eos> I'm guessing yours is breaking things, moving heavy objects, maybe grunting from time to time?<eos> He does a lot of grunting.
I just know why you'd value one case over another and then put it off on me.<eos> Why don't you just receive it<eos> - as it's being given? - What is it that I'm receiving?<eos> Detectives.<eos> Should we step into my office, or do you two need a minute?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Views of the whole city.<eos> And a company pool.<eos> You must do well to afford all that.<eos> We do well.
No, that's awesome, because nobody--<eos> [Matt] I don't really give a shit what it is.<eos> -Nobody's done that, like-- -[Matt] You won't get caught, though, because, like, it'll just be, like, an image.<eos> "Oh, well, did you get that beer from that fuckin' whatever that fuckin' image is?"<eos> If fuckin' Don't Fret made our symbol, that would be...<eos> -Yes, yes, yes.<eos> -[Noelle] Yeah, yeah.<eos> Don't fret.<eos> -He wouldn't do it for, like, any, like--<eos> -Don't you do it.
Thank you very much.<eos> - So...<eos> - What?<eos> I get the impression you quite liked the car.<eos> What I loved most of all is they've made it out of bits that they already had lying around in the factory. It's like you going home after your tripto South Africa, opening the fridge, and using what's there to make a delicious shepherd's pie.<eos> What, some stale milk and an old piece of cheese?<eos> - And it costs £1.8 million?<eos> - Yes. How much is that, Jeremy, in rand?<eos> Ten hundred and 30 million and a million.<eos> But for that it does 0-60 in 2.9 seconds?
What's wrong with this cart?<eos> - You got the brakes on? Go!<eos> - Ow!<eos> Your spikes.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Cramps.<eos> Luke and I just split a Beef Wellington and clams casino.<eos> Um, I'm wondering if you'd, uh, sponsor me for the new-members thing tonight.<eos> Gee, I'd like to, but they got rules about relatives sponsoring new members, so...<eos> No, they don't.
Come along, we'll take your statement.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> It's not her.<eos> I saw you by those sheets.<eos> I thought the same as you.<eos> She could top herself, but not kill someone else.<eos> - Have they arrested her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You think she did it?<eos> No, I don't.
Christopher's son.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, so, we go in.<eos> You got my back, right?<eos> No.<eos> And I don't have hers either.<eos> Wh... I need help getting her to understand.<eos> No, you don't.
She said we needed to talk.<eos> I disagreed.<eos> Dad, if you ignore her, she ain't just gonna go away.<eos> You prove that point every day.<eos> - Momma! Hey, boys!<eos> All right! First hug, favorite son.<eos> Oh, I don't love you more, Jameson, you know that.<eos> Oh, hear that?<eos> That means she loves me more.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Do you know who this belongs to?<eos> Do you?
I had an idea what it was, so I looked into it.<eos> That picture was taken on Russell's phone.<eos> His case was broken, and a piece of plastic was sticking out over the camera.<eos> Police thought it had been damaged during the murder.<eos> But then I remembered seeing a picture at his place with the same obstruction.<eos> So the case had been broken for some time.<eos> Russell was the friend you took to Maui.<eos> You were having an affair.<eos> And considering your husband has a memento from the trip, I'm guessing he doesn't know.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.
I'd die before hurting that boy.<eos> I'll meet you on the other side... in Topeka.<eos> How'd you build this?<eos> Your mother built it for us.<eos> When she sleeps, you'll see her through the peephole.<eos> She and The Boy have a close bond, so with luck, she'll lead you to him.<eos> They've been trying, but our initial approach was overly confrontational.<eos> Telling the Firm you wanna meet Mr. Song?<eos> I have a client who's interested in rare-earth metals.<eos> No, you don't.
You'll keep searching.<eos> In the meantime, I must leave for council in Repton.<eos> I cannot ignore my duties just because one man has illegally entered my kingdom.<eos> He is not just one man!<eos> He is the history of his race, Father.<eos> He is the face of the enemy we must always fight, always overcome.<eos> And if we are the lambs of God, then he...<eos> He is the eternal wolf.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> You didn't.
Is that really true?<eos> So, do I just wash my hands of him?<eos> Like Pontius Pilate?<eos> Well, I have no doubt Aelle will enjoy the sight of your death.<eos> I'm sure he'll make it a big spectacle.<eos> So I will have the chance to speak?<eos> I'll talk about the gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.<eos> But my sons do.
They called him the Mozart of Meat.<eos> Sherlock says he knows a little something about genius, and that... "No truly exceptional intellect would knowingly submit flawed work."<eos> Now, the FDA has consistently ruled that if two products are genetically identical, then they're legally the same thing.<eos> Even if one's natural and one's grown in a lab.<eos> Now, Pereya obviously knew that.<eos> So, Sherlock thinks there's no way he would've submitted bad research to the FDA.<eos> So, he went to Next Century Meats, and got them to give us Pereya's undoctored research.<eos> And you're comparing it to the work that was submitted to the FDA.<eos> You think someone doctored Pereya's work?<eos> Sherlock does.
That's where they drank their ale and did the bulk of their planning.<eos> -Cheers.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> But these weren't your run-of-the-mill retirees.<eos> They were a group of outlaws, with a criminal history going back decades.<eos> -So, what's the job?<eos> -Hatton Garden.<eos> The vault, yeah?<eos> I've got it all sussed out.<eos> The ring leader, Brian Reader, did his first break-in at age 11.
For as long as it lasts.<eos> The Janus Order has sent me.<eos> They are starting to question your leadership.<eos> They are worried... you don't have everything in control.<eos> As long as his ring is on my finger, I can control him.<eos> But how long will that finger be on your hand?<eos> We have information to suggest the Trollhunter possesses the Birthstone.<eos> They weren't supposed to know about that.<eos> I thought you burned the books.<eos> I did.
Not like I even care.<eos> It's like, whatever.<eos> I should listen to my psychic.<eos> She says, "Stop dating losers, and never go on a plane."<eos> I knew it.<eos> Oh, so you think he's playing hard to get?<eos> Or the more likely scenario:<eos> He lost his phone in, like, a fire.<eos> - Yeah, I think he lost his phone.<eos> - Yeah. I do too.
I said no.<eos> That part was actually a lie,<eos> - obviously.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> So what did they want to know about Stevie and I?<eos> If I'd seen you commit any crimes.<eos> And drugs.<eos> They think you're selling a lotta drugs.<eos> - Do they?
What, better than you?<eos> How many men would sacrifice their careers for their family like you have?<eos> Oh, I didn't sacrifice anything.<eos> I have everything I've ever wanted.<eos> - Debbie.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Will you continue to be my wife?<eos> I wondered when you'd give that back to me.<eos> I was wondering if you still wanted it.<eos> I do.
We thought your daughter was a boy.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, what he means is that<eos> Dylan told us that a fourth grader was picking on him, but he didn't tell us it was a girl.<eos> Yeah, and if you had, we'd have told you it's never okay to hit a girl.<eos> And that she's probably only bugging you because she likes you, buddy.<eos> I do not like him.<eos> I think she likes him.<eos> Gross, whatever.<eos> She totally does.
Yet you quote us a higher price on the bonds.<eos> Please explain that to me.<eos> There's no way that makes sense.<eos> There's no way you're marking these swaps appropriately.<eos> Why shouldn't we back out of this trade right now?<eos> Didn't I say when we made this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks were clueless?<eos> Didn't I say that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Didn't I say it?<eos> Yes, you did. You did.
Try not to get too righteous and listen a little.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Who is this guy?<eos> A real solid-gold asshole.<eos> - I'm a CDO manager.<eos> - A "CDO manager"?<eos> Yeah, at Harding Advisors.<eos> I didn't realize that there was anything to manage with CDOs.<eos> We select the securities that go into the CDO portfolio and monitor the assets.<eos> I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.
Would who she was, who she really was, be enough?<eos> There was no magic to help her this time.<eos> This is perhaps the greatest risk that any of us will take.<eos> To be seen as we truly are.<eos> Have courage, and be kind.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm no princess.<eos> I have no carriage, no parents, and no dowry.<eos> I do not even know if that beautiful slipper will fit.<eos> But if it does,
-Shit.<eos> -Carter, give me your lighter.<eos> Here.<eos> Are you guys ready?<eos> -Wait!<eos> -What?<eos> I need to say something.<eos> Ben, it's fine.<eos> -You don't have to do this.<eos> -No, I do.
Yo, 'Zilla!<eos> You!<eos> I just want to be left alone!<eos> I missed the perfect date with the girl of my dreams because of you - and your trap!<eos> - That was mine.<eos> Yeah?<eos> That was your trick, here's mine.<eos> Stay away!<eos> - I didn't mean for this to happen.<eos> - Oh, but it did.
- Where is he?<eos> - Hey, I don't know. Okay?<eos> Maybe you can find him.<eos> Okay.<eos> When's the last time you seen him?<eos> Ten days.<eos> Carolyn Cobb was killed 10 days ago.<eos> What's that, a coincidence?<eos> Detective on the case, Guerrero, he know about all this?<eos> Of course he does.
- Sorry. Thank you.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> What if we don't like it here?<eos> Where we're going?<eos> I think we will.<eos> What if this company goes belly-up too?<eos> That's not gonna happen, because this company is a lot bigger than Daddy's company was.<eos> And that's better, huh?<eos> They promised us a car, right, babe?<eos> Yeah, they did.
Getaway. Stop.<eos> Stop, she can do it. Go, go.<eos> Shit!<eos> - I can't, I can't. - What are you doing?<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Annie, look at me.<eos> Just do it. Don't think about it. Okay?<eos> Stop yelling at me, Jack.<eos> - Don't think about it. Look at me.<eos> - Don't do it, Mommy!
Well' I thought it would be a good idea to videotape your mom giving birth.<eos> I was saying, "Push harder, push harder,"<eos> and she gave me a look, like...<eos> You know that look Mommy gives, like...<eos> "You're in big trouble."<eos> And then I came out?<eos> Then you came out, yep.<eos> And then they spanked me?<eos> Well, they spank all little babies 'cause they're trying to get them to cry.<eos> - But she didn't?
Turay just makes sense. If it makes money, it makes sense.<eos> Two for the bills, one for the belt.<eos> The Turay fight makes better sense.<eos> No, no, no. You think Miguel's a better fighter?<eos> No. I didn't say that. I didn't say that.<eos> What do I got to do?<eos> What do I got to do, say it again? - You want me to say it again?<eos> - You want to fight me? Do you want to say it again?<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Why do you do this in front of all...
- It is.<eos> You have become senior advisor, Lawrence.<eos> You've morphed into a political animal.<eos> - Technically, I'm under you, but...<eos> - What?<eos> There are no other men like me, and no other women like you either, of course.<eos> You've become some kind of, queen.<eos> No, just a woman who misses her man.<eos> Oh you mean your officer who joined in the glories of war.<eos> Yes, I do.
No way!<eos> - Let me out of this car!<eos> - Stop yelling!<eos> - Let me out now!<eos> - No! I will not!<eos> I gave you my very last pin, young lady, and I am not about to let it go to waste.<eos> What do you mean your last pin?<eos> Wait, that place I saw...<eos> - It exists?<eos> - Of course it does.
No, let's don't do that, because we are not going to get anything out of this.<eos> Anything.<eos> We walked in miners and we will walk out miners.<eos> I didn't sign the book deal.<eos> Was I going to?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did I want to provide for my family and for my kid?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> I didn't.
It's a hybrid synthesis of adrenal epinephrine secretions.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - It won't keep you alive.<eos> But when you take it, you won't know you're dying.<eos> I'm dying.<eos> I'm dying, yes.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> All right, what to do?<eos> What to do?<eos> What to do?
I'm gonna tell her that it's not a good time.<eos> No, wait a minute.<eos> Kim gave his life for this.<eos> People need to know that we can predict these things now.<eos> You want a copy?<eos> I got about a thousand in storage.<eos> No one listens to us until the ground shakes, I guess.<eos> They told me what happened to your colleague.<eos> We don't have to do this now.<eos> Yeah, we do.
You're an embarrassment to me.<eos> Today in there, all I felt was shame.<eos> But if you come back committed to God to truly change your ways... then it's God's edict that I forgive you and I do.<eos> But in your mother's name I cannot forget the past 10 years.<eos> I cannot.<eos> I know.<eos> What in the world are you doing?<eos> Ma always wanted us to clear this field together.<eos> You and me?<eos> No, she didn't.
Off.<eos> Number one, bottom bunk, that's mine.<eos> You're on the top.<eos> This is hell.<eos> - Never again.<eos> - Never again to America?<eos> The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.<eos> I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.<eos> Let's go for a smoke.<eos> I don't.
It just sits there in the rubble.<eos> Three feet from our faces.<eos> And on the side of the shell Is painted one word.<eos> "Stark."<eos> We were trapped for two days.<eos> Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off."<eos> We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.<eos> I know what they are.<eos> I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.<eos> Now I don't.
This means so much to me.<eos> I know what it feels like.<eos> I know what it feels like to be in that chair.<eos> - We'll see you tomorrow, okay?<eos> - Thank you, ma'am. And good luck.<eos> - Thank you for coming.<eos> - Thank you. - Go get the next person, Tony.<eos> Neil.<eos> Sorry, we have legal stuff with Barry, now.<eos> Yes, we do.
Okay, everyone, listen up.<eos> I know this is the last day of school...<eos> But first, before we leave... we need to finish picking our partners for this year's summer pen-pal project.<eos> When I draw a name, stand if you want to be their partner.<eos> Here we go.<eos> The next name is... Pigpen!<eos> I will.<eos> A little dirt never hurt anyone.<eos> Schroeder.<eos> I do!
Trust me.<eos> I can do this by my... this is my thing right now with Amy, so...<eos> But I am your mother, and you are going to sit with me and allow me to be your support system.<eos> I'm not gonna sit with you.<eos> I'm gonna do this by myself because I'm a big girl and I need my privacy sometimes, so can you please go?<eos> Let's just give her a minute. This is about her.<eos> You don't have to be here right now...<eos> But she needs somebody to support her through this.<eos> - Uhh! I'm fine!<eos> - No, she doesn't.

And please explain the hat.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> You like the place?<eos> I think it could be really great.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> - How clever of Sonny to buy it.<eos> - Except he didn't buy it.<eos> You speak for me?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I did.
Fuck!<eos> Fuck someone!<eos> Fuck a tit!<eos> Fuck a tit hard!<eos> For the love of Alan Greenspan.<eos> Fuck!<eos> My life is ruined.<eos> I venture you've heard that I'm going to prison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, we all did.
When will you be going to Egypt?<eos> At Easter.<eos> But I've actually given up on the idea.<eos> Oh?<eos> Did you get a refund?<eos> I haven't really checked yet.<eos> Shouldn't we just go?<eos> Together?<eos> I thought you didn't like the idea.<eos> But I do.
- My wife.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> Me too.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.<eos> About the divorce, I mean.<eos> You told me no divorce.<eos> Victor!<eos> Introduce your friend to Rachida.<eos> Everyone knows Victor Mayence.<eos> How do you do.
I want 20% of the Malaysian tin ore hit.<eos> For releasing my money?<eos> No, for renting you my code.<eos> It's my action that gave that code you wrote meaning.<eos> What's it mean without a bankroll?<eos> You want to be my partner?<eos> It's 20%.<eos> You call it whatever you want.<eos> I meet my partners.<eos> Well, I don't.
You've gotta come on down.<eos> My hands are frozen.<eos> My feet are frozen.<eos> We're sending people up to you with tea and O's.<eos> But you've gotta get moving.<eos> Rob?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> You've gotta get your circulation going.<eos> Okay, my love.<eos> You do it...
(GUN COCKS)<eos> - (GUN SHOTS) - (SCREAMS)<eos> Service will be up in 20.<eos> Finn's preparing the feeds now.<eos> You fucking kidding me?<eos> (GASPING)<eos> Nancy, you should have taken the hotel.<eos> (CAR ENGINES START)<eos> So how do we know we can trust these guys?<eos> We don't.
There you go.<eos> Put your hands right here.<eos> The goal's pretty simple.<eos> All you gotta do is hang on for eight seconds.<eos> There's nothing to it.<eos> Yeah, some bulls are nice like that.<eos> This is... Yeah, okay.<eos> Excuse us, sorry.<eos> So how do you know which one you're gonna get?<eos> You don't.
Ip Man, it's a business deal -<eos> keep your damn nose out of it.<eos> hello, this is Chi yan Primary school.<eos> We need police here right now.<eos> Some thugs are causing trouble.<eos> - Cut it out.<eos> - Let him go.<eos> Let my boss go or I'll whack her.<eos> - Let my boss go, now! - Let him go.<eos> - Do it!
Me, too.<eos> And all of us.<eos> Hey!<eos> I ain't the one with the time bomb in my arm.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> But I'm not gonna let you do it.<eos> I can't let anyone else die because of me.<eos> No one else is gonna die because of you.<eos> Tori's gonna find a way to disable the disks...<eos> And if she doesn't?
Thank you, Jan. Jan, thank you.<eos> Mr. Boldwood.<eos> What a pleasant surprise.<eos> Will you join us?<eos> Nice to have you, sir.<eos> A song, ma'am.<eos> I have no voice.<eos> Come on, ma'am, you've got a lovely voice.<eos> I thought we were rather good together.<eos> So did I.
We're leaving, and we're laughing at you.<eos> You're laughable.<eos> Aun...?<eos> You're the one everyone is looking for.<eos> You're the Shamer's daughter.<eos> Come.<eos> Dina Tonerre.<eos> And you don't have to look me in the eye.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> - I just do it.
I'm going the fuck in.<eos> You can't.<eos> We need someone to follow De Luca without being detected... and that will hopefully take us to Rayna... but it can't be any of you.<eos> Here's what we do...<eos> I go into the Face/Off machine, get a whole new face.<eos> I turn up, they never know it's me.<eos> Do you have quarters? Because it costs 50 cents.<eos> What, I gotta pay?<eos> No, because it doesn't exist.<eos> Yes, it does!
The bartender says:<eos> "Why the long face?"<eos> Checked?<eos> - The Gag is 100 years old.<eos> I think I am really at a crossroads.<eos> No matter which way I look, everywhere just wasteland.<eos> I have until a week ago not even seen the sea.<eos> Now I swim in it rum.<eos> Only a few days ago a stranger comes up to me and offers me that he helps me, my dream to live.<eos> No shit, how often does something like that before already?
Your future hasn't been Written yet, right?<eos> - No one's has.<eos> - No one's has!<eos> Your future is whatever you make it.<eos> - So, make it a good one.<eos> - Make it a good one.<eos> -[screaming]<eos> -[Gale] People always say to us, "Well, you guys must have known you were gonna do sequels<eos> "because of the ending of the first movie."<eos> Well, no, we didn't.
-Front bottom?<eos> Are you five?<eos> But what is the deal?<eos> Do they all have chronic diarrhea?<eos> You really think that Beyonce has the shits all day?<eos> At least the toilet never smells when they're done.<eos> What are they doing in there if not pooping?<eos> How should I know?<eos> -They never even admit that they fart.<eos> No Finni, they don't...
Aziz, stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Aziz, they'll come back.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> They'll come back.<eos> Celal!<eos> Did you let her know?<eos> A slim waist and a good set of teeth.<eos> Celal, did you tell her that you don't want a moustache?<eos> I did.
Make a scene<eos> Take me inside. Hide me<eos> Anything to control this beast<eos> You're my life<eos> Hairstyle is terrific, boss<eos> Hairstyle<eos> Hairstyle<eos> Joining the movies?<eos> - I wanted to<eos> Sure, I did
Just feel me.<eos> Feel me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Feel me.<eos> Okay. I feel like I'm the one with the tits in the equation, but this is cool.<eos> Grab my tits.<eos> Grab 'em. Feel 'em.<eos> You wanna lick 'em? Uh-<eos> - Shit. You wanna lick 'em?<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, I don't give him my phone, so I'd appreciate it if you didn't give him yours.<eos> Okay, I won't.<eos> Great.<eos> I just want him to connect with something.<eos> Joy.<eos> Joy, he's really doing fine.<eos> I don't know what's wrong with me.<eos> I'm supposed to be happy.<eos> You just need to rest, okay?<eos> No, I don't.
Jogging shorts and all.<eos> Here, take this one.<eos> You can give the 50 cents to my mom the next time you see her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Goodbye, Monroe.<eos> Goodbye, Minnie.<eos> I'm better than you, you son of a bitch.<eos> I always thought I wanted to be exactly like my mom.<eos> But she thinks she needs a man to be happy.<eos> I don't.
What?<eos> Just please shut up.<eos> Please.<eos> I'll do whatever you want.<eos> Just please don't say shit like that anymore.<eos> I can't guarantee that.<eos> In Washington, 10 of the original 19 subpoenaed began their testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee.<eos> Mr. Trumbo, raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth so help you God?<eos> I do.
Yes.<eos> ~ I'm here. ~ I don't know what's happened, but... Alfie's gone.<eos> Gone?<eos> I think he's jumped.<eos> Oh, my darling!<eos> Oh, he's always had very powerful legs!<eos> I think he's just bounced himself over the edge! ~ Oh!<eos> ~ Oh! I can't bear to look!<eos> Don't!<eos> Please, don't!
-Did you just call me old? Because I know you didn't just call me old.<eos> Look here, grandpa. I'm an entrepreneur.<eos> I bought a pair of Yeezies for retail two years ago, sold them this year for $3,000.<eos> Then I went and bought a pair of SB Pros, Paris Editions, sold those for $4,000.<eos> Nah, no way, those are worth 25 hundo, tops.<eos> [boy] You don't know anything about sneakers, do you?<eos> Hi. Merry after Christmas.<eos> Hi. What are you doing here?<eos> Remember how you told me you wanted these sneakers and you were gonna camp out?<eos> -I did?
She killed herself...<eos> Did you know that?<eos> I just know what it said in the report - a car accident.<eos> A lapse at the wheel.<eos> My Dad made her life hell for 20 years.<eos> He's a drunk, you know, it's probably not in the report.<eos> He got us all involved in that Evangelical stuff, like that would make things better.<eos> Why don't you tell us about that.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Just talk to me.<eos> Okay? Relax. Okay?<eos> Just take it...<eos> Whoa, shit!<eos> Kate... What is it?<eos> What?<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Shit, what the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> Don't...
What you want, a scooby snack or some shit, man?<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> You always trying to act like I'm not paying attention and shit.<eos> Call it correct.<eos> We saw you at the diner.<eos> Saw you following us and shit.<eos> You have fun?<eos> What the fuck do you want, man?<eos> I want to know who did the drive-by on one of your corners.<eos> Oh, you do?
Now I kind of like it.<eos> Looks good.<eos> - All right. Let's take a picture. - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Ready?<eos> - That's a good one.<eos> Do another one.<eos> - Okay, okay. - Different pose. - Hold on.<eos> How do we know if Alonzo's even here?<eos> We don't.
- And then I came along. - What about Lily?<eos> I know, I know.<eos> - Come on, what we had was real.<eos> - That's right. When I met you, I was lost.<eos> I was a fucking mess, all right?<eos> I was so insecure, and you saved me, all right?<eos> You rescued me.<eos> Now, I don't know what to do. I...<eos> - You know what to do.<eos> - No, I don't.
All civilians are innocent.<eos> Act like the bullets have eyes.<eos> Then, how about taking a photo?<eos> For the historical record.<eos> Comrade Ahn, you can change clothes.<eos> Okay.<eos> We can't fight on an empty stomach<eos> Captain Yem said you would cover our compensation.<eos> What's with you?<eos> He did.
Listen, I wasn't gonna bring this up tonight, but you should know that there are some serious doubts from people at the State Department.<eos> You mean Cathy.<eos> And some on her staff.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, in over your head, wearing two hats, the obvious things.<eos> And are you saying this because you don't want to move forward?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm sharing with you so you fully understand<eos> - what you're getting into.<eos> - And I do.
What, you mean, why you're not coming out of a blackout on the beach in Tahiti, using your panties as a pillow, dumped and realizing you ruined your life on some half-wit, narcissist man doll?<eos> Yeah, I mean, God forbid I make my own mistakes, right?<eos> Like you haven't made enough of those.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> You should be kneeling down, thanking whatever that you didn't end up as "Everlasting's" ultimate tabloid idiot, all right?<eos> This was a gift.<eos> A gift?<eos> Wow. [Chuckles]<eos> Wow. Love is swell... but it is not something you build a life around.<eos> Actually, some people do.
It's great. Yeah, no, I need to do some yoga, 'cause this is just...<eos> Is there a lot of yoga in England?<eos> Don't know.<eos> More a polo guy.<eos> Well, I'm sure that we could find some creative way to release our energies.<eos> What? Yeah, you know, just, in England, we could find something...<eos> You and me in England?<eos> So now they want you to go to England with me?<eos> - No.<eos> - Of course they do. Yep.
Just tell me, 'cause I'll stop.<eos> I-I'll get out of here and leave you alone.<eos> I don't want that.<eos> So, tell me...<eos> What do you do?<eos> I dance.<eos> What else do you do?<eos> That's it, really.<eos> There's got to be more to you than this place.<eos> What do you...
By opposing voices in his head, both arguing that they are right, but one has to be wrong.<eos> To know the difference in that moment, that is what makes an officer.<eos> What makes a man.<eos> Well, I see the difference here, sir.<eos> I know it.<eos> He arrived just before you did.<eos> And he told me what you did.<eos> After he invited you into his home, trusted you to assist his son and daughter, and you flagrantly violated that trust.<eos> Sir, I don't know what he told you, but...<eos> Yes, you do.
We're united in this.<eos> Even...<eos> Shepard?<eos> And Slayton?<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - No joke, Jim.<eos> Gordo, Gus, and Wally said they'd stand with us, too.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we do.
You'll know.<eos> ♪ ♪ Listen, I want you to know that I do appreciate everything...<eos> Letting me move in, the rent...<eos> [Laughs] This weekend. Come on.<eos> Believe it or not, we are just trying to help.<eos> I know you are.<eos> I'll tell you what, if or when I need it, I promise I'll come to you.<eos> I don't care who you go to, as long as you go to somebody.<eos> What I need you to understand is that you and I,<eos> - we do things differently.
- And he who finds it...<eos> - Becomes invisible.<eos> Invisible?<eos> I clon't believe that, Buffalmaooo!<eos> They were fooling you.<eos> Perhaps, but the mason who works there...<eos> - At Monte Morello?<eos> - He's a friend, an honest man.<eos> He says they found it there.<eos> - He did?
Out.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Listen to me, Henry.<eos> No more guns.<eos> Stop behaving like a mad old bastard.<eos> I promise I will find whoever killed Charlie.<eos> Keep your head down.<eos> No more public displays of rage.<eos> You said you didn't trust me 'cause I'm a drunk.<eos> I did.
Yeah. They wouldn't hesitate, not for a second.<eos> Can the Hermes function for 533 days beyond the scheduled mission end?<eos> It should.<eos> Built to last the full Ares mission... so technically, it's only halfway through its lifespan.<eos> But if something goes wrong...<eos> Then we lose the crew.<eos> We either have a high chance of killing one person... or a low chance of killing six people.<eos> How do we make that decision?<eos> We don't have to make it, Bruce.<eos> He does.
Yes I can. I was there. I witnessed it.<eos> This is a car crash.<eos> Professor Stoddart was hacked apart.<eos> If Dan had justification for suspecting Frank Sutter did that then he had good reason to use overwhelming force in the arrest.<eos> Are you trying to persuade me, governor?<eos> Or are you rehearsing for a judge.<eos> Look. If your sheriff is anywhere near those interviews, all the interview evidence will be deemed inadmissible.<eos> You're a lawyer, you should know that.<eos> You want to conduct the interviews.<eos> Yes I do.
No need to impress me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Not here.<eos> This will just take a moment, Sarah.<eos> You can't be in here.<eos> Everyone's going to think I'm looking for a job.<eos> You mind?<eos> They should always think you're unhappy.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> And for the first time, they don't.
No, uh, uh.<eos> None of that, drunky.<eos> No. We've waited long enough.<eos> I want to be boyfriends again.<eos> And I want you to take all this off.<eos> Come here.<eos> Bring me that hot ass.<eos> Hey. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> I want this... And you.<eos> I really do.
So.<eos> What do you want with me?<eos> I wanted to meet you.<eos> Because?<eos> Because i had a vision of you as a zombie, Chasing a man through an alley.<eos> You were about to rip open his skull.<eos> He was killed in a dui accident, wound up here.<eos> I ate his brain.<eos> Until the vision, i thought i was the only one.<eos> Yeah, until, like, three seconds ago, so did i.
Here are all there.<eos> - Ah yes...<eos> You know it so that with an ethical approach.<eos> Charming.<eos> As head off to playtime.<eos> Honestly, they are old enough to post their own pictures.<eos> Let me make times.<eos> This is the worst train accident in France for 25 years.<eos> Initial reports said there are six dead and dozens injured, nine of them fatal.<eos> More about the circumstances of this drama does Richard Place.
- I...<eos> No. - It is.<eos> I wouldn't call it a problem.<eos> Honey, you don't have to cover for me.<eos> It's not a problem, it's just that we're not totally comfortable.<eos> It's not her problem. Okay.<eos> It's...<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> No, it's me. I have a body issue.<eos> - Honey, you don't...
- Everywhere...<eos> Nowhere.<eos> We moved from one racing stable to another, my mother and I.<eos> She died when I was 15.<eos> First I was at a home, now I work here and there...<eos> Anywhere there's horses.<eos> It must seem odd to a sheltered girl like you...<eos> Who knows where she belongs.<eos> I never knew where I belong.<eos> I do, now, but... At our farm...
But I could never have aborted.<eos> Especially when you see what they become.<eos> Better to live like a sleepwalker...<eos> Could you ever abort?<eos> - You want an ashtray?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I can't have children.<eos> Oh, well don't worry.<eos> Some people try for 10 years until they can have kids.<eos> And others never do.
Other things we're just fighting like hell to hold on to.<eos> Everything you people have been through, I don't know if you see that.<eos> We do.<eos> Bring your kids in for a checkup.<eos> I know I offered you one, but they really should come in.<eos> They were out there a while, right? Yeah.<eos> Thanks, Pete.<eos> Let's be friends, man.<eos> We kind of have to be, right?<eos> Yeah, we do.
No.<eos> I'm saving you.<eos> We're supposed to be out here.<eos> We're supposed to feel like this.<eos> I don't want to forget.<eos> And running makes me feel better.<eos> I can't forget.<eos> I dream about it.<eos> Being in the forest with them.<eos> I do, too.
Neither did I.<eos> I was a cynic just like you.<eos> Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs.<eos> When the fire burned out, I thought I'd find her blackened bones.<eos> Instead, I saw her, Daenerys, alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.<eos> Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?<eos> No.<eos> It's hard to be a cynic after that.<eos> Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.<eos> No, it doesn't.
That prick firing you?<eos> Best-case scenario is my two-year plan just became a ten-year plan.<eos> That schmuck.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.<eos> - I lost the client.<eos> - Not your fault.<eos> They're not really playing with a full deck, those Kettlemans.<eos> - You had to take their case?<eos> - I'm sorry, okay? I tried.<eos> I really did.
Oh, it's Mr. McGill.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Oh, I love what you've done with the place.<eos> Last time I was here, it was well, not a contender for the cover of Good Housekeeping, that's for sure.<eos> - Do you have news about our case?<eos> - I do, in fact.<eos> But before we get to the nitty-gritty, I think we should chat about your deal.<eos> We told you, there will be no deal.<eos> You did, didn't you?
- What is this?<eos> - Happy anniversary.<eos> - Three months. - It's a quarter paper anniversary.<eos> I bumped it up.<eos> How did it go with Hanne and Saga today?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I met her only briefly.<eos> Hanne is clever.<eos> I don't know if she understands Saga.<eos> - Who does? - I do.
Did they tell you they got ripped off by Ferraro?<eos> - No. - Then why am I here?<eos> Because this alley is directly between our fourth-grader's house and her school.<eos> You speak Spanish?<eos> A little.<eos> My French and Italian are better, but when I was in grade school, I could reach three countries on my bike from my house.<eos> Yet none of those countries speak Spanish.<eos> The Spanish I learned in Tehran.<eos> They speak Spanish in Iran?<eos> Spanish teachers do.
Ajamu's our key witness here.<eos> He must have heard something.<eos> Big friendly dimwit is only gonna say what he's told to.<eos> - He needs social services.<eos> - He won't have them.<eos> "Shane looks after me." Shane's his problem.<eos> If we could get him to talk...<eos> If we push him now, Shane's toy solicitor is only gonna scream "undue pressure".<eos> Let's wait and see, and if Kieran wakes up, there's your witness.<eos> What if he doesn't? What if he doesn't?
I think I've got this all wrong. I thought the gods had brought us together to try to stop my vision of the apocalypse, but now it seems we're actually making it happen.<eos> You have to get us in there so we can try and stop him.<eos> Only if I can have the ring when we do.<eos> Look at you... in your peasant's tunic.<eos> You're no son of a King.<eos> Take him the ring! He'll know if what I say is true.<eos> Who is your mother?<eos> Aethra from Troezen.<eos> How do you know my mother, Medea?<eos> I don't.
I love dolls.<eos> My father could never forgive me for that.<eos> When I was eight years old, my father made me join a swim club.<eos> He'd been on the same club and... he said that the things that he learned in that locker room were the things that made him the man that he is today.<eos> I hated that locker room.<eos> At that age, I was really uncomfortable with my body.<eos> I didn't like to be naked, especially in front of other boys.<eos> But you had to take a shower before you could go in the pool, so I would do it, but I would wear my suit and a tee shirt.<eos> And the boys would tease me, but I would try to hurry and... ignore them, and it...<eos> And then one day it didn't.
Eichen is built on the convergence of Telluric currents.<eos> Ley lines.<eos> It's what allows it to keep certain supernatural creatures in.<eos> And certain others out.<eos> They knew you were coming.<eos> They're here.<eos> And you unlocked the door for them.<eos> We can go a little faster, if you want.<eos> I'm doing the speed limit.<eos> Nobody does the speed limit.
Now.<eos> Choose your attendants.<eos> Clarke, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> If this truce doesn't hold, I killed Finn for nothing.<eos> Clarke is right.<eos> We need to do this.<eos> Peace with the Grounders is the only way we'll survive.<eos> Oh, I don't think they know what peace is.<eos> - The commander does.
Mother...<eos> This is not a good time, Lykos.<eos> You don't have to stop what you're doing.<eos> I've heard of a poison that you can give to an animal that won't kill that animal, but will kill anyone who eats it.<eos> Poison?<eos> I think it's called bloodroot?<eos> Apparently, it will put a man to sleep, or make him go mad and even kill him.<eos> Who have you been talking to?<eos> Priest Xerxes said the only person he knew who would have some was you.<eos> Did he?
Now I go to work.<eos> You know, you are expected to go home at night.<eos> Most fugitive cases are solved in the first 72 hours.<eos> If Stark's sailing into the sunset, maybe this is where he starts.<eos> He must have really liked that girl.<eos> Hmm? Because there's no other reason why he'd get in a boat.<eos> I'm sorry, Daniel, but Stark hates water.<eos> He can't even swim.<eos> Really?<eos> How do you...
You haven't answered any of my questions.<eos> You took a young, naive, rich girl<eos> - with daddy issues.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - And got inside her head... - Stop.<eos> Now I'm getting choked up.<eos> Other than the money, what do you care?<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> Nah.<eos> But you did.
You know, there is no religious directive on file, so okay if I recycle him?<eos> Factory on 39 needs some fertilizer.<eos> Not yet.<eos> I'd like to know what the hell Holden is discussing with the Captain right now.<eos> For all we know, he could be working out a deal.<eos> Yeah, for himself.<eos> The only thing I see here is an incoming ship.<eos> One you can't even identify.<eos> How do you know they're coming for Naomi?<eos> We don't.
He accepts him.<eos> Now, who among us doesn't want understanding and acceptance?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You did this.<eos> You set him free.<eos> It was you I wanted to set free.<eos> You said Hannibal was curious if I would kill.<eos> You were curious, too.<eos> - I didn't want this.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Eat something.<eos> This moment...<eos> How things go in the next few weeks-- will decide--<eos> - That's why I--<eos> - Let me finish.<eos> Your grandfather left the ashes of the Weimar Republic and came to this country to build a name for himself.<eos> He built an empire from a shoe-shine box.<eos> And then, and only then, did he send for your father.<eos> Ma, I know the story.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm so happy. - So happy.<eos> - What seminar?<eos> It's called Lifespring.<eos> I did it last year in Mankato.<eos> - Amazing.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Yeah, and I just, you know, I want to be the best me I can be, ya know?<eos> Good for you.<eos> What did ed say when you asked him?<eos> You didn't, did you?
The fuzz!<eos> I like you, Titus.<eos> We represent Myron Affleck.<eos> I want you to read for his Spidermen musical.<eos> Get Myron on the phone.<eos> Try the pay phone first.<eos> If he's not there, try the car, where he lives.<eos> Pardon my French, but, Au bon pain!<eos> How do I know you?<eos> You don't.
Oliver, I told you before, if Thea finds out you've been lying to her all this time, you will lose her...forever.<eos> How's Tatsu?<eos> She'll be better when we're far away from here.<eos> Your bow.<eos> If you want anything else, take it quickly.<eos> We're leaving in five minutes.<eos> We're not coming back.<eos> Oh, we can't just run.<eos> Waller knows I tried to steal the virus to get Tatsu back.<eos> Even if she didn't,
Yes?<eos> Sir, President Petrov is on the line.<eos> I'll take it in here.<eos> Shut the door, please.<eos> - Viktor.<eos> - We know it was your men.<eos> What was?<eos> Did you think we wouldn't detect you?<eos> Whatever you're accusing us of, I don't know anything about it.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
Mexicans?<eos> Russians?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> Who? Who has something to gain by trying to fuck with me?<eos> You think it was someone here? What's in it?<eos> What he means is what you got worth taking anymore, Frank?<eos> My associate. His name's Ben Caspere.<eos> He was into that sweet Eastern Bloc pussy you all run between clubs.<eos> So, some of you might have girls that know him.<eos> Daniel here did.
All we're trying to do is ensure the deal for our parcel goes through despite Caspere's tragedy.<eos> If you got this transaction legally documented, it shouldn't be hard.<eos> You know we have issues.<eos> If we had a fucking paper trail, we'd be doing this through banks.<eos> Well, otherwise I'd say you're in the unenviable position of being owed money by a dead man.<eos> That's $5 million of my money.<eos> Hold it, we were given to understand that our partnership was with Catalast.<eos> Had Mr. Caspere made payment, it would have been.<eos> And your name would have been added to the corporate charter for the development.<eos> But he didn't.
And when I ran out of the woods and they found me...<eos> The woods?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> You said...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Hey, look, I don't think...<eos> This wouldn't help you.<eos> It might.<eos> It usually does.
Be with the one you love.<eos> Feel and trust heart. And the rest ...<eos> The dragon will not hurt you.<eos> Never!<eos> But not before flying!<eos> You were right, Yaroslava. - Rights? For what?<eos> Now I understand what is not with the one you love.<eos> You were against the marriage with Igor. Remember. Shit talking, sister.<eos> I did not think love Igor, and that he wants to become a prince.<eos> Do it!
But we both can't have what we want.<eos> So... your part... in this drama, by necessity, comes to an end.<eos> It's gonna take a lot more than a voice on a radio to stop me.<eos> It's not me you need to worry about.<eos> It's the city you just blew the hell out of.<eos> You...<eos> You think anyone's gonna believe that?<eos> You're running around in a mask, holing up with a known felon in the wake of a series of bombings.<eos> There's that police officer you're holding hostage, so... yes.<eos> Actually, I do.
You're yourselves.<eos> That's exactly what we need to convince Helle.<eos> Go ahead, Johanne.<eos> What's left without singing or dancing?<eos> You could tell stories about yourselves.<eos> You can't tell stories about people like us.<eos> I'm not so sure about that.<eos> Did you know that the bumblebee is unable to fly?<eos> It shouldn't be able to fly with its tiny wings.<eos> - But it does so anyway, right?
- Please.<eos> I want the house tonight.<eos> You can sleep in your room, but just stay out of the main house. Wait.<eos> Is tonight the night?<eos> If you mean, "Is Guy coming over tonight?" then yes.<eos> - For sex?<eos> - For dinner.<eos> - And sex? - Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go to Guy's. No, no.<eos> Do it here.
Paige, you don't have to go.<eos> They arrested Alison for killing Mona.<eos> She's in jail.<eos> She won't stay there.<eos> Yes, she will.<eos> Tell your parents, they have to let you stay.<eos> It's safe now.<eos> Emily, I have to go.<eos> Listen to me, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
Half of them can't even read a damn book.<eos> No, boy, this place ain't for you and me.<eos> It's good to have dreams, just so long as they're not fantasies.<eos> You let anybody sell you that shit, it's your own damn fault. - You hear me?<eos> - Yeah, I hear you, Pop.<eos> I'll get it to the House right away.<eos> - Green light on the release? - Yes.<eos> I don't remember giving you my phone number.<eos> You didn't.<eos> Your publisher did.
Keep going.<eos> Julia?<eos> Junior?<eos> Junior?<eos> Did you speak with him?<eos> How are you, Sam?<eos> I'm well.<eos> As well as can be expected.<eos> Day by day, you know?<eos> I do.
Henry.<eos> After Matt's dad.<eos> Henry.<eos> That's a good, strong name.<eos> I hate to talk to you about doing the right thing.<eos> Doing it is the easy part.<eos> Knowing what it is is tough.<eos> And let me guess.<eos> You know what the right thing to do is.<eos> No. No, I don't, Matthew.
Before I lose my good cheer.<eos> Go!<eos> He has a point.<eos> GORDON:<eos> Yeah.<eos> BULLOCK:<eos> So, what next?<eos> Assume Loeb and Falcone are the only ones who know where the stash is. We need someone close to them. Someone who'll talk.<eos> That person doesn't exist.<eos> Yeah, he does.
- No, I-I know.<eos> - All right, so what now, Bobbi?<eos> Mack, are you talking to Bobbi?<eos> Tell her I take it all back.<eos> - All the "Don't die out there..."<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I'd be better off if she had died out...<eos> Hope she rots in hell!<eos> - I never wanted this.<eos> - No one did.
I'm not the one with the gift.<eos> I just work here.<eos> You think I can hear the stone?<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Can you hear it?<eos> No, not the stone.<eos> The mountain.<eos> It's the loudest thing here.<eos> Well, now take that frequency and see if you can amplify it.<eos> The last time I did something like this,
- And, uh...<eos> Fitz?<eos> Any progress?<eos> Some.<eos> Does May still think you're on a recruiting trip to London?<eos> She does, which is why I don't have a lot of time here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, sir, first, you are going to need ...<eos> - A lanyard.<eos> Yes, I do.
I know that Whitehall subjected you to unspeakable horrors, that he took everything from you.<eos> A good man, Phil Coulson, put a bullet in him.<eos> - Where did you...?<eos> - SHIELD recovered it from Whitehall's office after his death.<eos> I know that you were separated from your daughter.<eos> I thought that that might belong to her.<eos> A traditional Chinese gift to ward off evil spirits, isn't it?<eos> I never got a chance to give it to her.<eos> I kept hoping that if she was alive, evil would never find her.<eos> Not like it did me.
You opened it.<eos> You know how, uh, dangerous that could be?<eos> What's in the vial, howard?<eos> Okay, you're angry.<eos> I'm not angry.<eos> I'm just curious.<eos> What's in the vial?<eos> You know.<eos> We both know.<eos> I don't.
I put myself out there.<eos> You think it's my fault they don't see it, what I could bring?<eos> You wanna call me a loser to my face, you little shit?<eos> I didn't call you a loser, man.<eos> Oh, my boy's a liar now, huh?<eos> He say it, or not?<eos> - Speak up when I'm talking to you.<eos> - He said it.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> My dad did.
This city needs me in that mask, Foggy.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe it does.<eos> But I don't.<eos> I only ever needed my friend.<eos> I wouldn't have kept this from you, Matt.<eos> Not from you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Lots of Americans, of all ranges of income, choose to send their children to private or parochial schools.<eos> But isn't it true that you want your children to have a leg up on everyone else?<eos> Is that balancing the scales?<eos> Or is that hypocrisy?<eos> Or maybe it's that you didn't want to raise them yourself so you sent them to boarding school.<eos> You must really want to be president.<eos> I would never in a million years bring up your children in a debate.<eos> The way you choose to raise them is your business.<eos> Do I want the best for my kids?<eos> Yes, I do.
For how many?<eos> Just me and her.<eos> 100 for you and 20 for the sheep.<eos> 120 Birrs.<eos> That's what we need to be free, Chuni.<eos> It says here we need to expon more food to better our country.<eos> But what's the point, if we Ethiopians can't afford to eat the food we grow ourselves?<eos> That's right!<eos> Looks to me you're eating alright.<eos> What you doing, bumpkin?
The plague starts with Leland Frost.<eos> The true architects of the plague, they're watching me.<eos> I'm running out of time.<eos> ...is among you. Please, Cole.<eos> I said your name?<eos> You gave me this mission.<eos> You're the reason I'm here.<eos> Now, it's been two years, Cassie.<eos> Please tell me you know who Leland Frost is.<eos> I don't.
You're all dead men.<eos> Now, you got a choice.<eos> You can stay here, ride it out and die like men, or you can leave like cowards and kill everyone you've ever known.<eos> Families, wives, children.<eos> If you don't shoot this man, I will shoot you both.<eos> Shoot<eos> There is no new order, just the end of everything.<eos> Why are you so willing to die?<eos> I got it coming.<eos> Other people don't.
I need to be out there.<eos> Joe, you're always the first one to tell me when I'm not thinking clearly.<eos> I took down Clyde.<eos> I can take down his dirt bag brother too.<eos> You didn't do that alone, remember?<eos> You're right.<eos> How are any of these guys going to protect me?<eos> They don't know.<eos> They don't know what Mardon's capable of.<eos> All right, well, lucky for you, your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.
It's about Iris.<eos> She's looking into Mason Bridge's disappearance.<eos> We can't let that happen.<eos> Detective.<eos> Eddie, we need your help.<eos> Brazil?<eos> Why would... Mason move to Brazil?<eos> Apparently there was a girl involved. And he decided to go hike the Amazon with her for a year. You know, live off the grid, write his memoirs or something.<eos> Wow, I guess you really don't know anyone.<eos> - No, you don't. - Hey, baby.
~ You can't do that.<eos> Claire Ripley showed me a photograph.<eos> She was wearing Pippa's pendant.<eos> You go about your life thinking you're complete, then you meet someone and realise you're only half of something.<eos> People laugh about it.<eos> 'Have you met my other half? '<eos> Then when you meet that person... .. you know it's true.<eos> You're only really whole when you're with each other.<eos> Never ends well, does it?<eos> ~ What doesn't?
The gang war rages on here in Gotham.<eos> No one knows what set this turf war off... but it is commonly believed to be the result of the longtime power struggle... between Salvatore Maroni and Carmine Falcone.<eos> Longtime enemies, these men have often come to blows...<eos> [NEWSMAN CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]<eos> ALFRED:<eos> Still looking for secrets, are we, sir?<eos> Or just breaking stuff?<eos> Secrets.<eos> ALFRED:<eos> Why don't I...?
But, not impossible?<eos> See, the problem with being a nice guy is that screw-ups look so much worse on you because you're decent.<eos> Li, Nia's a bitch. Nobody expected anything better from her.<eos> And I hear that she talked you into doing some things that were kind of out of your comfort zone.<eos> She had a way.<eos> Maybe we can help each other. I need to know more about Nina.<eos> You should come on my podcast, tell me all the stuff that Nina was doing and own your part.<eos> Everybody loves a redemption story.<eos> He is definitely hiding something.<eos> I did some digging into "Mr. Seth Branson."
I mean, I'm making a... a leap.<eos> Well, it's a small leap... it's more of a hop, really.<eos> So, how do we get ahead of him?<eos> See, I think he's like a feral dog right now trying to find a place to hide.<eos> I think we lean into that.<eos> I think we go public, put his name and face to the media, force him into one place. Keep him still and then... figure out what he does next.<eos> And you think he's rational enough for us to be able do that?<eos> He's delusional, but not deranged.<eos> I mean, the way he sees it, he's just going to do what's necessary to... to get what he needs just to keep going, you know?<eos> How you doing, Ben?
I've lawyered up for the whole team.<eos> In the meantime, Ralph's being released back to you.<eos> Thank God.<eos> But he's my responsibility, so you need to stay close to me in case Eckherd wants him to come back in.<eos> Cabe, let me talk to them and clear this up. They're being extremely aggressive.<eos> The safe house intel in the game was stolen in a hack of the CIA mainframe three weeks ago.<eos> Details from six other unknown operations and safe houses were taken.<eos> Ralph had nothing to do with hacking the CIA.<eos> I know.<eos> But they don't.
Hang on.<eos> Patience.<eos> I got one more.<eos> Now it's time for the real fireworks.<eos> And it's gonna be all finale.<eos> Phil, did you shave your chest? Sure did.<eos> Did you shave yours?<eos> JK.<eos> No.<eos> But I did.
She ran away.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> This is, uh... wow.<eos> Okay, uh...<eos> - What?<eos> ! - I don't know what happened.<eos> I mean, we went down there in the middle of the night, right?<eos> And sh-she was all tied up securely and everything. We woke up this morning, she was just gone.<eos> I thought you said you tied a good clove hitch.<eos> I did!
I thought you liked architecture.<eos> I do, Doc.<eos> It's just, uh,<eos> I like killing vampires more.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Maybe we slowed down the rate of infection too much.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> We've only done two trials.<eos> - It has to work.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
Stay close.<eos> Why didn't you wake me?<eos> My God!<eos> What happened?<eos> Kelly got close, Eph.<eos> Setrakian thinks the Master has made her one of the more - sentient strigoi.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.<eos> You need to talk to him.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
Sometimes you've got to push back to get some respect.<eos> They are going to come after us.<eos> My fucking suit is ruined.<eos> I got to get back to my girl.<eos> You were a lion out there tonight, a fucking lion.<eos> He excommunicated us.<eos> Me.<eos> No, he said "accomplices."<eos> He didn't mean you.<eos> Yes, he did.
Paige.<eos> She thinks I should start praying.<eos> I would like to see that.<eos> She's living in a fantasy world.<eos> I don't know, because Jesus really came through for me tonight.<eos> I told Kimberly the reason I couldn't sleep with her was... because I had to serve Jesus instead.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you didn't sleep with her?<eos> No, I didn't.
Took care of both my parents... emotionally.<eos> I was raised to study every breath, every gesture.<eos> It's a survival skill.<eos> I survived.<eos> I never met anyone like you.<eos> Someone who just talks about things so openly.<eos> Maybe you could actually help me with some things that I'm going through.<eos> Difficult things.<eos> I... you know where to find me.<eos> Well, actually, I don't.
Do we renovate our way to a better future?<eos> There's work to do.<eos> Use this to cover costs.<eos> What kind of work?<eos> If he didn't tell you, I can't.<eos> So I'm just supposed to trust- You.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why would you in the future endanger you in the now?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> No, it doesn't, does it?
- A what?<eos> A swamp spirit from Slavic folklore.<eos> - It was supposed to be temporary.<eos> - It's not?<eos> Korsak keeps finding ways to tell me I've screwed up.<eos> It's been redrawn a bunch of times.<eos> How long have you had it?<eos> - [Elevator bell dings] Six months.<eos> - Oh, my god. We should all know better than to bet with Korsak.<eos> Well, I do now. Yeah.
Mark was taking a prescription for blood thinners.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> We found this receipt for coumadin.<eos> As it turns out, it was your credit card that paid for it.<eos> - So that means you knew about it.<eos> Well, I don't understend where this is going.<eos> Mark entered eight tournaments.<eos> You were not an official for two of them, - where he finished 83rd and 95th.<eos> - It happens.<eos> Yes, it does.
You take her home.<eos> She needs to get home.<eos> I'm gonna call a cab.<eos> - I should probably thank you.<eos> - Knock yourself out.<eos> She's right, you know.<eos> I'm angry.<eos> I am really angry.<eos> I'm a big bully, and I don't know where it comes from.<eos> You don't?
Your friend wanted to be a hero.<eos> And you know what happens to heroes?<eos> They die.<eos> You hurt my friend.<eos> I learned it by watching you.<eos> Aah!<eos> Ow!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> We both do.
My friend would totally, um, be shocked that I'm doing this, but...<eos> Hell yes.<eos> Easy, son.<eos> Easy. We cleaned and re-sutured the bullet wounds.<eos> We also redressed your arm.<eos> What happened?<eos> I... I burned it off. To prove my loyalty to the pastor.<eos> And that?<eos> Also part of your cover? I did what I had to to complete my mission.<eos> And you did.
Get out.<eos> - Calista, please...<eos> - Get out.<eos> - You just...<eos> - I said get out. Just leave!<eos> You are so sucked into their bullshit.<eos> And you don't even see it!<eos> It's like you think you've gotta be a Power to even matter in this world.<eos> You don't know anything!<eos> You don't anything about me!
♪ I don't know, I don't know ♪<eos> As the civil rights movement really swung into high gear, she swung into high gear with it.<eos> In '65, we played at the Selma March in Montgomery, Alabama.<eos> We have a legal and constitutional right to march from Selma to Montgomery!<eos> It was extremely dangerous.<eos> The federal Marshals were called in, and they were standing on the tops of all the buildings downtown with guns.<eos> Seated in front of the stage facing the audience was Martin Luther King,<eos> Ralph Bunche from the UN and a lot of other worldwide dignitaries.<eos> You had Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Sidney Poitier,<eos> Bill Cosby, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Belafonte, and we did "Mississippi Goddam."
Jackie must have lapped it up.<eos> Oh, yeah, she definitely did.<eos> Ezra, I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> Really.<eos> You did what you had to do to get in.<eos> There was no harm done.<eos> Yes, there was.<eos> I actually made Jackie believe that I feel this way about you.<eos> Well, I don't care what Jackie thinks.<eos> Only what you do.
Tomorrow, but she said she'll try to call me today.<eos> She has to get to Ali and ask about the phone number.<eos> Jason.<eos> Hello, Spencer.<eos> I left you messages. I know.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I don't think that's such a good idea. Jason...<eos> We've pretty much exhausted anything that we have to say to each other.<eos> You need to listen to me, okay?<eos> No, I don't.
Especially Peter.<eos> He would never understand.<eos> I'm very good at keeping secrets.<eos> These things last night, I... Why do you think they were after us?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's our turn.<eos> I'm OK now. I can drive.<eos> - You're not even close to fine.<eos> - I'm fine. And you need blood.<eos> We both do.
Protocols.<eos> Protocols. It's just that I got so caught up in this autopsy. I still have more important work to do.<eos> Maybe you really just need to get some sleep, sir.<eos> No.<eos> But, Klaus, it's just...<eos> Shelley?<eos> - Any sign?<eos> - No.<eos> - You said she was here.<eos> - Actually, I didn't.
Win some, lose some.<eos> Elizabeth looks at you very differently now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know how hard this is for you, with Paige.<eos> It's hard for The Centre, too.<eos> They're learning from their mistakes.<eos> Jared murdered his family.<eos> Well, that's hardly a risk here.<eos> I just want Paige to make her own decisions.<eos> We all do.
- It was a chicken. I borrowed it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> If the police were not around you would have ask me.<eos> I've done the homework. people speech, but something came to me.<eos> Like what?<eos> You are not really here for the funeral.<eos> - Why am I here?<eos> - I think Anton has been kidnapped.<eos> And he is the same perpetrator who took your daughter seven years ago.<eos> What I do?
How are you?<eos> - I'm always good.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> - I've been around.<eos> Look what came today.<eos> - You don't waste time.<eos> -Of course not.<eos> Chic!<eos> - You like them?<eos> -I do indeed.
you don't want to go where I'm going.<eos> You should get out of town.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> It's this town... and whatever's in it.<eos> What the...?<eos> Y-y-you're not gonna understand, but it's the only way.<eos> I wish you hadn't seen that.<eos> Do you, Rowan Blackshaw, take this man,<eos> Tomas Solano, to be your husband... to have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, to love and to cherish, from this day forward until death do you part?<eos> I do.
Looks like a lot.<eos> What is your problem?<eos> I don't have a problem.<eos> Give me the money you owe.<eos> How about I put a hole in your face?<eos> I'm gonna count to three.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> One...<eos> Put the money in the bag.<eos> Do it!
The gas is 52.70.<eos> - Got a restroom?<eos> - Down on your right.<eos> Everything makes me laugh!<eos> How long?<eos> What?<eos> The transplant. - How much time left?<eos> - 5 hours.<eos> Know where you're going?<eos> Of course I do.
How do you protect yourself?<eos> We all get tested.<eos> Every two weeks.<eos> Are you on birth control?<eos> I'm not on birth control.<eos> But we get tested for chlamydia...<eos> How are you keeping from getting pregnant then?<eos> Well, all shoots, they don't come inside you.<eos> Even if it looks like it on camera, they don't.<eos> They always do...

But I should apologize for sleeping with your husband.<eos> Not the first time I've said that. See ya.<eos> So, okay.<eos> Alan!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Are you having sex with Lyndsey while you're sleeping with our social worker?<eos> Yeah, my pimp hand is strong.<eos> No, it's not!<eos> Look, look, this thing with Lyndsey just happened.<eos> A-And, honestly, I-I'm glad it did.
Silence!<eos> Silence!<eos> On this page are words the Queen is said to have spoken to you, and which, in turn, you passed on.<eos> Do not read them aloud.<eos> Just tell the court, do you recognise them?<eos> "The King cannot copulate with a woman.<eos> "He has neither skill, nor vigour."<eos> I didn't say... These are not MY words.<eos> I don't own them!<eos> You do now.
Here she is!<eos> Basualdo, get a doctor! - Ordóñez!<eos> Take care of her!<eos> - Now, listen to me, ma'am...<eos> Look at me, ma'am.<eos> We're the police. It's all right, it's all over now.<eos> Look at me, madam. Come here...<eos> Look! There she is!<eos> Do you know her or not?<eos> - Do you?
Fuck!<eos> - Leave him.<eos> - Let go of me!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> That wasn't our plan.<eos> - Now we can't go to Mexico.<eos> - Théo, look at me.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> I never did.
I, uh...<eos> Martha, where are you going?<eos> To my parents'.<eos> I need a break.<eos> We need a break.<eos> - Martha--<eos> - No, um...<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
All right.<eos> I know what it is.<eos> It's a standard two-pronged hook inside of a high school locker.<eos> The victim's head was shoved against it.<eos> Wait, how did you know that?<eos> Because in high school, I was shoved in a locker multiple times.<eos> This also explains the victim's shoulder injuries.<eos> Before I tell Booth about this, do you really think your strategy of photographing ourselves...<eos> Taking a selfie.<eos> And yes, I do.
I trust you.<eos> Do not mention her.<eos> I would do the same for you.<eos> Hold on now, Javi.<eos> - When will they be here?<eos> - Five minutes after I seek them.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> I'll get help.<eos> Do not move.<eos> Do not do it.
When Henry didn't return my calls, I had a colleague in San Francisco ping his cell.<eos> So you found him in the park?<eos> When I got there, he was already dead.<eos> So I took his phone and his keys, and I began to investigate.<eos> And why didn't you call us from the crime scene?<eos> 'Cause I didn't want to waste my time having this conversation.<eos> My friend has been murdered.<eos> I have to find out who did it.<eos> No.<eos> I do.
I sure do.<eos> And I think I might be ready to give it to you.<eos> It's not sex. Then never mind.<eos> Wow, you're gonna be that honest about it.<eos> Saves time.<eos> Well, in that case, I want to move to your desk.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because it's no secret that in a few years, you're going back to Gordon, Schmidt, and Van Dyke.<eos> And let me guess, you want to come with me when I do.<eos> No, I don't. Then why?
I'm not gonna acknowledge it because nothing happened last night.<eos> Why? And don't tell me I know why.<eos> Because it would have been a mistake, and you know it.<eos> What I know is something happened, and you ran away, but not before you told me you loved me.<eos> I did that because I wanted to make you feel better.<eos> What did you just say to me?<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I didn't say that--<eos> Because you pity me?<eos> Yeah, you did.
~ I don't want to be the right thing.<eos> I want to be a choice, that's why I fucking hate this.<eos> You are without a doubt the most hard to please person I have ever met.<eos> If I showed you a rainbow, you'd be like, "Oh, there's too many colours. "There's too many colours on one thing."<eos> Yeah, well, at least I don't sell drugs that kill astronauts.<eos> I just started there, and they don't kill people any more.<eos> And you believe that, you gullible American prick?<eos> I only took the job because of you, you fucking ingrate shrew!<eos> Fucking Christ!<eos> Why the fuck did I...?
We're losing him.<eos> I hear she checked out.<eos> Who did?<eos> That shit-don't-stink fashion editor.<eos> Guess this place wasn't up to her standards.<eos> Not everyone can appreciate it here.<eos> All this lovely darkness.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> No.<eos> I really don't.
Oh, I... just lost my place there for a moment. What were we talking about?<eos> Honey, it happens all the time now.<eos> "Cassie, where my keys?<eos> Cassie, what day is it?"<eos> You talk to the doctor, Daddy?<eos> Huh? Your mama is the sick one.<eos> Only room for one in the family.<eos> Daddy, let me drive you over to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.<eos> I can drive myself if I want to go.<eos> And I don't.
Why should you be ashamed?<eos> You would just be doing your job.<eos> My job is to arrest them.<eos> And how does that make you feel?<eos> When you collar a man, as opposed to letting your fists be jury and judge?<eos> If it was up to me? - Yes.<eos> - I don't need a judge to tell me whether someone's guilty or not.<eos> I believe you, John.<eos> If they took the leash off me, crime would drop in this city.<eos> I truly do.
Flora.<eos> No.<eos> No, sir.<eos> She was never out of our sight.<eos> And besides, she was terrified of him.<eos> I think she knows something.<eos> I want you there when she wakes.<eos> I want you to hear it.<eos> Happily.<eos> If she does.
We create a computerized diary of all the dl's dealings.<eos> We just need to make it look Like it was created a couple years ago With digital imprints that even the best forensics<eos> Won't be able to tell are fake. If it contains everything in maya's head, Then the feds don't need maya<eos> And hector and his pals still go up the river.<eos> Can you guys really do that?<eos> Yes.<eos> No. That's fabricating evidence.<eos> The feds want her on the stand, under oath.<eos> Um, maya. Do you swear everything you're going to tell us Will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
We know that.<eos> We've been down that road before.<eos> Well, let's at least translate it, see what it says.<eos> You guys don't understand.<eos> The book's been calling out to me ever since I laid eyes on it, okay?<eos> Calling out to the Mark.<eos> I can hear it like it's alive.<eos> It wants me to use it, but not for good.?<eos> Look, I wanted it to be the answer, too, okay?<eos> I really did.
She's getting ready to run.<eos> What is this?<eos> Agent Keen just closed one of her accounts.<eos> She moved all the money to an offshore account an hour ago.<eos> It's not illegal to close an account, Detective.<eos> What's illegal is monitoring her financials - without a warrant.<eos> - Please.<eos> Main Justice wants to shut down our murder investigation<eos> - and we have to play by the rules?<eos> - Yes, we do.
- Is that her job, spying on people?<eos> No, she's a photographer, but she's had a hard time finding work.<eos> We've talked to Holst. He'll get police protection outside the grounds.<eos> - He agreed to that?<eos> - We told them about the surveillance.<eos> We need the videos from the metro station and the mall.<eos> - Lillian is going through the material.<eos> - I want John to look at that.<eos> I trust that the Danes can analyze surveillance footage.<eos> I don't.
Pesticides?<eos> You mean Reiden Global. Yes!<eos> Yes, that's it.<eos> - You don't want to see these anymore, right? - No.<eos> Reiden sells products all over the world.<eos> Who knows what kind of damage they're doing?<eos> It wasn't the food.<eos> I mean, it might've constipated them, cancer worst case, but... it wouldn't have changed their behavior.<eos> Okay, but this doesn't just happen.<eos> Sadly, sometimes it does.
That makes you eligible for the death penalty.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Right. Which is why we found you on a bus fleeing the country.<eos> We want the people you work for.<eos> Give them to us, and we'll talk to the U.S. attorney. Recommend a life sentence.<eos> You do enough you might even get the possibility of parole.<eos> Julian Powell.<eos> That's who paid me.<eos> A doctor named Julian Powell.<eos> - To do what?
There's a bomb!<eos> Blow it up! Blow it up!<eos> Blow it up!<eos> Blow it up!<eos> Blow it up! Blow it up!<eos> Blow it up!<eos> ♪ Our hearts were pure, we knew for sure ♪<eos> October 14th. Four years ago.<eos> Everywhere else in the world, they knew something had happened.<eos> Yeah. But we didn't.
Out of everything we told - you, that's your takeaway?<eos> - Federal crime, Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> You see the linkage?<eos> How about the fact that when this guy was working for Reiden, somehow Leo Butler created a bacteria that caused those wolves - to attack a prison?<eos> - Let's see.<eos> Leo Butler, a blackmailing embezzler, invents a bacteria that accidentally creates prisoner eating wolves.<eos> That's what you want me to tell my bosses at the Bureau?<eos> That's a better takeaway?<eos> We want to know what - is driving the bats wild.<eos> - So do we.
I didn't know I still had it.<eos> You know I love Justin, Mom, - right?<eos> - I know.<eos> But... do you think - if I got really bad...<eos> - Baby.<eos> - ... that he would come?<eos> - Clementine.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
Damon called you?<eos> He needed someone to talk to after you left the conversation without telling him what you were thinking.<eos> That's not exactly how it happened.<eos> And I quote-- "She stared at me like I was an alien and then basically teleported out of the room."<eos> Damon Salvatore stands in front of you and tells you that he wants to become a human again.<eos> Wouldn't you freak out?<eos> I just--I needed some time to process.<eos> I mean, 24 hours ago, I didn't even think it was possible to become a human again.<eos> But you want to be a human again. Yeah.<eos> Well, I did.
I underestimated you, Pete.<eos> You're a man who listens to his instincts and does what he has to do to be heard.<eos> The problem is, is not everyone respects your initiative.<eos> Barbie knows that you cut the beams in the ceiling, that you're responsible for the deaths<eos> - of those two people.<eos> - What?<eos> Hey, I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> And I understand why.<eos> But Barbie doesn't.
Have you thought about why?<eos> Well, I'm guessing you have a theory.<eos> You're being manipulated to be part of this kinship.<eos> The man I love should see right through that.<eos> Don't turn away from us, from what we have.<eos> What we had is in the past.<eos> It should still matter to you.<eos> Look, what I have now with Eva there's no more tension, no more drama.<eos> We can just be.<eos> But do you really...
We should keep looking, though.<eos> He could be an ally.<eos> There are no allies left in Chester's Mill.<eos> Those people may be infected, but they're not lost.<eos> I'm not giving up on Barbie.<eos> Well, you should.<eos> Poured my damn heart out to Junior.<eos> It's useless.<eos> Emotion doesn't work.<eos> It does work.
Sam's on our side.<eos> You finished with Christine's recorder? Almost.<eos> I seriously needed a break from her voice, so I moved on to the Aktaion files Lily sent.<eos> - Who's Lily?<eos> - Long story.<eos> Hektor Martin?<eos> Longer story.<eos> Apparently, he's the real head of Aktaion.<eos> I thought Barbie's father was.<eos> Yeah, so did I.
-Yes. Now I can do whatever I want.<eos> Death, I met him when I was a boy, but only as a silence in somebody I cared for.<eos> But only as a silence in somebody I cared for.<eos> What is Morten Nielsen trying to say?<eos> -Sasja?<eos> -No idea.<eos> Is it a positive or negative image of death he's painting?<eos> It's a fucking boring image.<eos> -Please read the rest of the poem.<eos> -Please do it yourself.
Yemen... Somalia.<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> We'll know more when we track down that Chuck Norris look-alike.<eos> How do you plan on doing that?<eos> That military skull tattoo I told you about.<eos> That could help ID him, right?<eos> We'll see what we can find out.<eos> But it's a long shot at best.<eos> I know this seems impossible.<eos> A lot of our cases do at first.
- Oh, yes. For cows, right now.<eos> We did it.<eos> We did it!<eos> I mean, you... did it.<eos> Trust, I say.<eos> Our first baby, on Christmas morning.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Noelle.<eos> You want to see your Daddy?<eos> Do you?
What if I never wanted the world?<eos> What if a heart, a real heart, and the love that goes with it, is all I ever wanted?<eos> Tell me, did you find any last night when you were spreading your legs for the good doctor while they snatched your child?<eos> Good.<eos> Let's see this true heart of yours.<eos> Go on. Do it.<eos> Cut mine out.<eos> Kill the only person who's ever devoted themself entirely to you.<eos> Go on. Do it.<eos> Do it.
- Is everything all right? - I just got worried.<eos> I...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We should...<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Does everyone have to sign in and out here?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Fire regulation.<eos> We got pulled up on it last year.<eos> - You done it? - Yep. Yes.
Back off.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll tell your dad.<eos> He'll go out there to find you, then other people will, too.<eos> And then somebody's gonna die.<eos> You saved my life and now I'm saving yours.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Got away from me.<eos> You'restillhere.<eos> Don't.
All you're giving me is how.<eos> What I need is a why.<eos> There's a big country we need to take it by the hand, tell it a story.<eos> We wait too long, somebody else will, then we'll never get control of this thing.<eos> Sir?<eos> The VAN just landed.<eos> O'Connor.<eos> Is there someone more important you need to see?<eos> Yes.<eos> And so do you.
It's not a lie when you don't tell somebody who you're talking to on the phone.<eos> That's normal. Not when you hide in the bathroom to do it.<eos> You don't have a boyfriend.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> - Oh, you want to talk about hiding?<eos> What's the file in your... none of your business.<eos> Well, great.<eos> Get your hands off me.<eos> Look, it's okay. We both said things we didn't mean.<eos> Yeah, and some things we kind of did.
Enjoy your parade... alone.<eos> Nimah, stop this.<eos> "Stop this."<eos> He's a war criminal.<eos> No, a soldier isn't a criminal just because you don't believe in their war, Nimah.<eos> Are you defending your own kind? No, I'm not.<eos> I'm standing up for a man who's gonna make a great special agent someday.<eos> Probably a better one than I am.<eos> Don't you mean a better special agent than you're gonna be?<eos> No, he doesn't.
You know what?<eos> You don't have to answer that.<eos> We shouldn't even be having this conversation.<eos> Relationships are forbidden at Quantico for a reason.<eos> They knock you off your game. Absolutely.<eos> Especially when your game is playing Hoover and Clyde Tolson in the boiler room and Clyde's dad catches you.<eos> Oh, my God. All right, if Caleb's father wanted to bust you guys, you'd be in front of the N.A.R.B. by now.<eos> Well, it just wasn't the intro to the Executive Assistant Director that I had hoped for.<eos> I barely survived.<eos> But you did.
What's the point?<eos> He's not breathing.<eos> You know, my agency exists because yours imploded.<eos> But we came back, albeit with less real estate and a lower profile.<eos> The low profile's the problem.<eos> No one knows you exist, but bizarre events keep happening.<eos> And people need to feel safe.<eos> So all these APBs on alien threats... those are to help people feel safe?<eos> Look, the truth is, you don't understand what you're dealing with.<eos> And you do?
Nope.<eos> He wasn't home.<eos> Well, I'm here.<eos> I want to talk to you about everything, just not tonight, okay?<eos> So, you'd talk to him, but not your own boyfriend?<eos> It's different, Ollie.<eos> Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't wanna talk about this right now.<eos> Well, What if I do?
What fundraiser?<eos> I don't know anything about this.<eos> Um, okay. I cleared it with Joe.<eos> - The bartender.<eos> - Joe...<eos> Joe has no authority to approve this.<eos> If you could just give me two minutes,<eos> - I could explain to you what it is and I'm sure... - Listen.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I don't do fundraisers.
_<eos> It's supposed to be about how we are many things at once or that words don't define us.<eos> _<eos> In a few days, they're going over to the Waite Gallery for my show.<eos> "My show."<eos> I have been dreaming about saying that for years.<eos> I'm trying to do a few more before the actual event.<eos> I was thinking, um... Maybe I could sketch you some time.<eos> _<eos> Actually, I do it off of a photo.
- Come, like, around six? - Poppy?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Hi. Good morning.<eos> Um, regarding Wacky Hair Day.<eos> The thing is, kids are naturally anxious about their appearance just really on any given day, so to disrupt the routine, you know, a routine that some of us are barely hanging on to just to get them dressed and out the door and get the snack made<eos> and get the lunch made and get the sunscreen on and get them in the car and get them here on time, and then you, kind of, add this, um, lunatic wacky hair wrench into the works...<eos> - Sarah, are you okay?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> No. I... I'm a single parent now.<eos> - And I don't...
- Yeah, that's Distant Star Pathfinder.<eos> It was the program NASA was in the middle of when Roz and I... joined.<eos> We weren't privy to the details.<eos> - You know where NASA was running it?<eos> - They weren't.<eos> An independent contractor proposed the project, ran things out of a lab complex.<eos> Facility shut down years ago.<eos> Maybe worth looking anyway.<eos> Do we have to guess who it was that funded this independent contractor?<eos> No, you don't.
I did.<eos> And I shouldn't have been so standoffish with you in the file room.<eos> Well, maybe I shouldn't have had that be our first interaction.<eos> No, that's not on you.<eos> That's on me.<eos> I never welcomed you to the firm, and I should have.<eos> You know, when I was a young mother, first week of school, every day I dropped my little girl off.<eos> When I left, she cried.<eos> Friday came, I left, she didn't cry.<eos> So I did.
Will you open up now? Come on.<eos> Let's start with names, shall we?<eos> Um, I'm Clara.<eos> This is the Doctor.<eos> It's OK.<eos> 'Ah, this is where I come in.'<eos> Hello.<eos> I wanted to get out of there.<eos> Immediately.<eos> Of course I did.
(Robert) I'm glad you agree.<eos> I'll let you know when the paperwork's finished.<eos> I know you didn't wrap your head around this deal in the last ten minutes, so what are you still doing in my office?<eos> Exactly what you'd be doing in my place.<eos> Robert, I know you said that you know these two lawyers, but I don't.<eos> I need to see for myself what they will or won't do.<eos> And you still want to counter.<eos> I want to at least try.<eos> Except you don't want to go by yourself, you want me to go with you.<eos> Yes, I do.
And then he was like...<eos> This cannot go on.<eos> I know.<eos> Can't we just leave her?<eos> No, we can't.<eos> We got to find a safe place for her and your baby.<eos> Anything happens to you, that kid is Plan B.<eos> Plan B?<eos> What exactly are you planning on doing with it?<eos> How we doing back here?
- Edge? What edge?<eos> Okay, I'm listening.<eos> Yeah, so I was thinking, why don't you take a couple of days off, come with me to see the dragon base?<eos> No, impossible.<eos> There's far too much to do around here.<eos> Okay, Dad. Well, tell you what, if I'm being honest, the reason I'm really here is that I've got a dragon problem back on the island.<eos> Dragon problem? What kind of a dragon problem?<eos> Well, you see, we're trying to relocate a new species of dragon and I thought we could handle it, but we could really use your help.<eos> Well, I suppose I could spare a moment, if you really need me.<eos> Oh, we do. We really, really do.
He was my mentor, actually.<eos> So my doppelganger, a man who looks exactly like me, betrayed you.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm not him, so you need to listen to me when I say you can take care of Zoom, and all we have to do is capture Doctor Light.<eos> I thought about testing the mask for Light's DNA, but it would only have Linda's.<eos> The mask, what mask?<eos> Light's mask.<eos> How did you get this?<eos> Iris shot it off Doctor Light when she attacked Linda.<eos> You know how to use the mask to find Light?<eos> Yes, I do.
But if you use his weaknesses to publicly humiliate him, I'm done working for you.<eos> Rachel, what are you doing here?<eos> We already sent back all of the contracts.<eos> I know, I just came by because you missed a signature on the last page.<eos> No, I didn't miss it.<eos> I was holding off on signing it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I was wondering why you made changes to seven different addendums without redlining them for me.<eos> They're just signatory pages of a few lists of partners, so I didn't think that that warranted a redline.<eos> You didn't or your partner didn't?
He's not real. But I am.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Look at me. That future you told me not to be afraid of...<eos> We can have it.<eos> The house in Storybrooke.<eos> I'm not afraid anymore.<eos> I want it.<eos> With you.<eos> You just have to want it, too.<eos> Aye, love, I do.
In what way?<eos> Well, her appearance for one. She'd gotten rid of her facial piercings.<eos> Changed her hair color.<eos> Oh, that. I see that all the time when the residents are applying for fellowships.<eos> If they want people to call them Doctor, they'd better look the part.<eos> That's her boyfriend Joel Brown or so I understand.<eos> We can go in there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, class, what do you say-- whoa!
- Good night. - Head upstairs.<eos> - Celebrate.<eos> - Do you want glasses?<eos> That was abrupt. Yeah.<eos> He's short.<eos> I wish you didn't have to go through that.<eos> We'll just try again because apparently, like, it's actually... the easiest time to get pregnant is the first six months after you've already been pregnant.<eos> So this is, like, now, and then it gets to be difficult again, so now we should... this is when we do it again.<eos> I mean, not like today.<eos> But we... we do it again.
Don't do it!<eos> Don't do it! - Apo!<eos> Apo!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Apo...<eos> - Son of a bitch!<eos> - Apo, don't worry!<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> Stop it! You son of a bitch!<eos> Don't do it...
Don't do it! - Apo!<eos> Apo!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Apo...<eos> - Son of a bitch!<eos> - Apo, don't worry!<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> Stop it! You son of a bitch!<eos> Don't do it...<eos> Don't! No!
You're not using your brain to help people.<eos> You're using it to fool people, and you want me to tell you that you're a good person for it.<eos> I am a good person. You're a person that wants to have their cake and eat it, too.<eos> And I'm afraid that I'm all out of cake with you.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means that I've often wondered whether or not I did the right thing by not having you arrested that day.<eos> That would have completely screwed up my life. Oh, and look at how not screwed up it is right now.<eos> You want to know what kind of man I am?<eos> ♪ ♪ You wanted to see me, Father?<eos> Yes, I did.
And every minute an assault team doesn't show up at my door,<eos> I'm proven right. You killed Simon.<eos> How did I figure it out, you ask?<eos> I'm a student of human nature, Ted.<eos> Once I figured out motive, I poked and I pushed a few buttons to see what you'd do.<eos> I saw the pain in your face at the museum.<eos> And I saw the fear in your eyes when I said you killed the King. That's how I knew.<eos> The human body has a vast number of "tells".<eos> - You're no exception. - You don't know anything!<eos> Technically, I don't.
Okay, remember, you just need to distract him while I switch out the cases.<eos> I've got it.<eos> Okay, Richard?<eos> Relax.<eos> So what is all this?<eos> I told you, I got about a hundred VHS tapes in here. From Fellini to Capra.<eos> - You want some or not? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Put 'em over there somewhere.<eos> Tío Eduardo, I hear you make a great coffee.<eos> Well, as a matter of fact, I do, Miss... - Santanico.
I got a plan to get Armstrong.<eos> Actually, couldn't be easier. All I gotta do is plant this little device on Armstrong's computer, and then I'll be able to access, remotely and discreetly, all of his files.<eos> So how do we get it on the computer?<eos> Um, well, um... One of us is going to have to go over there and do it.<eos> I'm gonna have to be running point at my keyboard. And, well, I figured that Kara should be on lookout. She's got the X-Ray vision.<eos> Oh! So I'm the one who gets arrested if this doesn't work out.<eos> - James, you don't have to.<eos> - No. It's all good.<eos> Okay.<eos> How do I do this?
I didn't say she was pretty.<eos> I didn't say you said she was pretty.<eos> Why? Do you think she's pretty?<eos> Well, I guess. I don't know.<eos> Carter, do you maybe have a little crush on Supergirl?<eos> You got good taste, kid.<eos> This is my friend Winn.<eos> You're a Supergirl fan, huh?<eos> You know... (WHISPERS) I know her.<eos> - No, you don't.
I didn't say you said she was pretty.<eos> Why? Do you think she's pretty?<eos> Well, I guess. I don't know.<eos> Carter, do you maybe have a little crush on Supergirl?<eos> You got good taste, kid.<eos> This is my friend Winn.<eos> You're a Supergirl fan, huh?<eos> You know... (WHISPERS) I know her.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - No, you don't.
It's a power grab<eos> - of our civil liberties.<eos> - You done?<eos> - For now.<eos> - You...<eos> You want me to go back... inside Metro?<eos> - I haven't been there since...<eos> - Since you were hooked up<eos> - in a milk bath, I know.<eos> - No. Actually, you don't.
Actually, that's not important.<eos> Seems like a solid jumping-off point, bro.<eos> Guys, who you think sucks is not helpful information.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey! Did Chad ever fight with anyone?<eos> Well, I mean, sometimes dudes from other frats would get pissed because he crushed so hard at pong.<eos> He was just a great guy.<eos> He invented Stripper Car Wash Sunday.<eos> Which sounds degrading, but all the proceeds went to charity.<eos> Dude, no, they didn't.
I'm into costumes that look like stuffed animals.<eos> Like sexually.<eos> It's a fetish, okay?<eos> I was not expecting that.<eos> Here's what I'm going to need.<eos> I'm going to need details, photos.<eos> We don't need details or photos.<eos> Unless you have them, and they're hilarious.<eos> We definitely don't need details or photos.<eos> Yes, we do.
How many times have you said that you wanted her dead, that you wanted the person who killed mom to die?<eos> The Orea bombing.<eos> Your mother died in the Orea bombing.<eos> Look at her.<eos> Her name was Sharon.<eos> Did you know that before you blew her up?<eos> Blair, honey, whatever they're telling you to do--<eos> Dad, no.<eos> I am so sorry, but I had nothing to do-- You killed her!<eos> No, she didn't.
Yeah.<eos> We checked.<eos> You had markers and I.O.U.S all over the city.<eos> At underground casinos... the kind of establishments that don't take kindly when you can't pay up.<eos> I bet you thought it was your lucky day when your brother asked you to forge that Van Gogh.<eos> Justin was gonna sell the original painting.<eos> The two of you would split the profits, but when you found out that he was just gonna give that painting away, you got a little pissed.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I-it doesn't prove that I killed him, either.<eos> No, but the hair at the crime scene does.
Be that as it may, he must not find out about this case.<eos> So, getting settled in okay?<eos> You can dispense with the pleasantries.<eos> We're not your houseguests.<eos> My team has been reviewing the activities of this task force for the past few weeks, and it appears that you have not only been communicating with Reddington and Keen, but have been assisting them in some investigative capacity.<eos> That's right.<eos> That was him on the phone, giving us another case.<eos> So you admit, then, to servicing Reddington's agenda instead of hunting him down?<eos> We talk to them because it keeps them close, increases our chances of making an arrest.<eos> You do more than talk.
We told you not to come back here, okay?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Asher!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Pack your bags. Do you have a safe?<eos> Open it.<eos> We called the police.<eos> We want nothing to do with you.<eos> Get your passports and whatever cash you have in the house.<eos> - Do it right now.
They'll be here soon.<eos> What is it?<eos> Should we wait and meet him?<eos> I'm fucking starving.<eos> Should we wait for the main actor?<eos> That bastard.<eos> What's all this?<eos> I've got it.<eos> -I'll do it.<eos> -I'll do it.
Mitchell died instantly.<eos> Shannon and Kelly were killed in the crash.<eos> What happened to Hernandez?<eos> He died soon after.<eos> So, if Mitch's dad was killed protecting Gibbs' family...<eos> Then Gibbs will do all sorts of crazy cowboy stuff to protect Mitch.<eos> Thank God!<eos> I finally got to say it out loud.<eos> We got to protect Gibbs.<eos> Yes, we do.
Angela doesn't know, and... and I want us to keep it that way.<eos> That pain in your foot?<eos> It's a symptom, Paul.<eos> It's called diabetic nerve pain.<eos> It could be the reason you crashed your car.<eos> Are you saying I put my baby in the hospital? No.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> She loves you. She'll understand.<eos> Just tell her... do you have any children, Richard?<eos> Do you?
I should get this back to the lab.<eos> Hey, come on, your software can't stand in that arch and compare the bricks.<eos> And it can't pull this book off the top shelf and flip to the right page.<eos> - We're close here.<eos> - You just wanna solve it.<eos> Damn right, I wanna solve it.<eos> So do you.<eos> I can do this here.<eos> You know why it didn't work out with those other guys?<eos> Because it didn't.
I don't know.<eos> I mean, Callie's gonna be there.<eos> - Since when's that been an issue?<eos> - It's not.<eos> It's just...<eos> I don't want to make her new girlfriend feel uncomfortable.<eos> - You know, intimidated by me. - Mm.<eos> I mean, if she's even bringing her.<eos> I don't know if she's bringing her.<eos> Do you?
- For all of our sakes.<eos> - Well, you can see where the label "twisted" will precede "genius" in your obituary.<eos> Um, if you're recommending a publicist, I'm all ears.<eos> What's gonna happen to her?<eos> The viral vector that landed on her skin will change her pigment first.<eos> Carcinoma. Then deeper tissues.<eos> Her immune system will do the rest.<eos> Biology is so deliciously messy.<eos> How do we stop it?<eos> You don't.
I'm not your housekeeper.<eos> We're looking for a boat that has been stolen.<eos> We thought maybe Mr. Milo could help with our investigation.<eos> - He's where? - Guatemala.<eos> He's, uh, showing a property.<eos> - the day after tomorrow? - Okay.<eos> I come back then.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Why would Milo know anything - about a stolen boat? - I don't know.<eos> Maybe he doesn't.
Police have the assailant in custody.<eos> His name is Dr. Lionel Gray, a genetic scientist at Seoul National University...<eos> This is what we're dealing with now?<eos> Decentralized cells.<eos> We have a tonnage issue with insanity in this country.<eos> And genius insanity, which is a dangerous combination.<eos> Attacking with a genetic slime that modifies cells, turning facial skin pigments into a hideous death mask.<eos> You know Memento Mori is going to try to top this.<eos> Even though Gray is in custody.<eos> I do.
You figured he was doing it for one of them.<eos> That lead pan out?<eos> It led us to the cabin of a woman on Fiddler's Neck.<eos> By the time we arrived, it was deserted.<eos> She must have seen us coming.<eos> We pulled DNA from the residence and sequenced it.<eos> This allowed predictive facial reconstruction of three people.<eos> A female and two males, twins.<eos> Now, none of these matched any genetic records in the database.<eos> But a fourth sample did.
Thank goodness.<eos> No, you can't be here.<eos> The buyers are on their way.<eos> - Buyers?<eos> - Blomfeld's selling them to a third party.<eos> I need to get you three out of here.<eos> What about them?<eos> Put them in.<eos> What do we do when they wake up?<eos> How about they don't?
You don't care for him much, do you? My father?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> Is it because he bribed the district attorney to keep me out of prison?<eos> You know about that?<eos> It was a difficult pill to swallow, knowing that my absolution was paid for, accepting a literal get-out-of-jail-free card for the beating of Oscar Rankin.<eos> Considering the alternative, I made peace with it.<eos> What I don't understand is why your father would tell you what he did.<eos> Both agreed you didn't need to know.<eos> Well, he never said a word.<eos> Then how did you...?
I don't want to talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> But just tell me...<eos> Do we hate him?<eos> We hate him.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> We hate him.<eos> So, um, how'd it go last night?<eos> Ugh. It didn't.
Okay, baby glitter hearts it is.<eos> All righty.<eos> I'm gonna hit my hut for a napparoony.<eos> Napparoony? How does he know about napparoonies?<eos> Where is he learning this stuff?<eos> And why is he so calm and relaxed?<eos> He did possess an uncharacteristic degree of relaxedness.<eos> You know, this isn't the first time he's disappeared and come back all happy and... "all righty."<eos> [sighs] Your Majesty, this mystery calls for an investigation.<eos> Yes, it does.
I said no, but I just thought I should tell you.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You two are close.<eos> There is nothing going on between Sebastian and I.<eos> I mean, I'm a happily married woman.<eos> I know that.<eos> So, um, what-what's really going on?<eos> I don't...
I know how to let things go.<eos> Honey, we got to get the key back from Matt.<eos> My whole life.<eos> Hmm? I have never been better than Matt at anything<eos> - except losing.<eos> - Honey. You are successful.<eos> You're a great father.<eos> You have a beautiful, intelligent, tolerant wife.<eos> You don't need this stupid Ping-Pong game to prove yourself.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
There's no word to be had.<eos> Major Cloud, may we speak with you?<eos> Troopers, advance!<eos> Seventy million people are watching this.<eos> The first 10 or 20 Negroes were swept to the ground screaming, arms and legs flying, packs and bags went skittering across the grassy divider.<eos> Those still on their feet retreated.<eos> A cheer went up from the white spectators lining the south side of the highway.<eos> Come on.<eos> You gotta come on.<eos> Please, don't...
I'm not saying she was wrong to be pissed, I'm not.<eos> I'm just saying that she could've been a little more patient, little more forgiving.<eos> Would've saved me that parade of drunken assholes.<eos> So, what's the point?<eos> Of what?<eos> I don't know, any of this. Everything.<eos> Everything?<eos> What's the point?<eos> I mean, I sure as shit don't know.<eos> Neither does anybody else, okay?
Maybe you'll do a better job with that kid.<eos> I'm just joking.<eos> So what, you're here to replace it before the kid finds out?<eos> Yes. But I can't tell what magazine it's from.<eos> I just...<eos> Do you have any of the centerfold remnants?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I, um-<eos> - I tried to tape it back up.<eos> Did a great job.
What were you doing at my house?<eos> I came by to tell you that I think it's okay now.<eos> Okay for what?<eos> Okay to have one of those rare, rare moments where we get what we want.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, what do we want?<eos> You know what we want.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think the kids want it too.<eos> Not as much as I do there, schlumpy shoulders.
Let's go with black.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Alex.<eos> He looks like a billion dollars.<eos> 2.6 billion.<eos> Raymond Sellars.<eos> I've looked forward to meeting you, Detective.<eos> I really appreciate everything you've done for me.<eos> Well, we funded this program to give men like you a second chance.<eos> You just do your best today.
We are here to stay.<eos> Finish him.<eos> The more you struggle, the faster you drop.<eos> Indeed, your fleet is strong.<eos> I...<eos> Yet, as I was about to explain before I was so rudely interrupted, the Nemean Lion was strong, too.<eos> Yet, he still destroyed it.<eos> And not with a sword or a spear or arrows.<eos> No!<eos> I did it with my bare hands!
They need someone to look up to.<eos> My son believes in you.<eos> Bring us peace, and I will believe in you, too.<eos> I'm convinced these are good people.<eos> I see.<eos> And who's more convincing, Cotys or his daughter?<eos> All the gold on Earth is not as convincing as a pair of breasts.<eos> Maybe, but gold never ages.<eos> Which is why I got them to double our price.<eos> Double your weight in gold? Well done.
Do you believe me?<eos> Good for you.<eos> Don't everjust say what people want to hear.<eos> But I will... I will see you again.<eos> Will you keep this for me?<eos> Gershom.<eos> Gershom, please look at me.<eos> What kind of god tells a man... to leave his family?<eos> If you understand it, I'll understand it.<eos> I don't.
- Peeler?<eos> - You know, a potato peeler?<eos> Oh, God, yeah, I know what that is, right.<eos> I was a different person then.<eos> I didn't really like myself.<eos> And do you like yourself now?<eos> Excuse me, sir. You cannot have a dog in here.<eos> Dog goes, you guys go, okay?<eos> And I'm telling you... - ... I got guys following me.<eos> Yes, I do.
What am I supposed to think?<eos> I don't hear from you for...<eos> Are you coming home?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Look, I've got to go.<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> - What is it?<eos> What? Dropped the cup on the floor.<eos> You see, that's what you do?<eos> - I didn't do...
When I call the police and give information they said they would protect me.<eos> We have. Every time.<eos> So as long as you are on the case, I do what I do.<eos> Maybe it stop what happened to me happening to other girls.<eos> - Let's see what you got.<eos> - Okay.<eos> By your art, my dearest father, you have put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.<eos> The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek, dashes the fire out.<eos> Oh, I have suffered with those that I saw suffer.<eos> You do exactly that on Friday.
Thank you.<eos> Christine.<eos> It's Ben.<eos> Your Ben.<eos> If I'd have known you were in any kind of danger, I'd never have stayed away.<eos> I had to.<eos> For Adam's sake.<eos> He's our son, Chris.<eos> And he loves you very much.<eos> We both do.
-Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no...<eos> Wait, don't do that. You need to go. Yes.<eos> It's ringing.<eos> Jesus Christ...<eos> It's all very confusing.<eos> And it's...<eos> Confusing.<eos> Very.<eos> -You know, Josh knows about us now.<eos> -He does?
No.<eos> No, there's no escape from this place.<eos> Gally, listen to me.<eos> You're not thinking straight.<eos> You're not.<eos> Now, we can help you.<eos> Just put down the gun.<eos> I belong to the maze.<eos> Just put down the gun.<eos> We all do.
Fuck, no!<eos> This is stupid!<eos> "Really?<eos> Are you really happy?"<eos> I think it looks pretty. Pillows are pretty.<eos> And, you know, curtains and...<eos> We don't really need curtains, 'cause, you know, we have shades.<eos> - Yeah, no.<eos> Decorative.<eos> No, we do.
Get away.<eos> You get away!<eos> You better lose my number.<eos> You lose it!<eos> I'm gonna lose the memory that you ever lived!<eos> Security!<eos> Hey, dude, when I tell you last night got crazy...<eos> You remember the slutty chicks, right?<eos> We start doing shots.<eos> We do, like, fucking 16 shots, back to back.
You're aware that Abnegation is undermining... the faction system and breaking laws... harboring Divergents?<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> But if that's true, then I'm glad that I left.<eos> See, I need to know that I can count on you... to enforce the law... even if it's been broken by someone close to you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Good.<eos> Then I'll have my car take you back to Dauntless.<eos> Come on! Get her over!<eos> Come on, do it!<eos> Do it!
Thank you. -Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> - I'll see you in court.<eos> -I'm sorry. I just--<eos> I'll see you in court.<eos> [ALL CHATTERING]<eos> GUS [IN DISTANT VOICE]:<eos> Judge Palmer.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God'!<eos> [IN DISTANT VOICE] I do.
What the hell are we dealing with here?<eos> Off the record.<eos> Two days ago, this man, Erik Lehnsherr... escaped from a maximum security prison inside the Pentagon.<eos> We believe that this woman is a former associate of Lehnsherr's.<eos> They were together in Cuba, the day of the crisis in '62.<eos> He was also implicated in Kennedy's assassination.<eos> What about that thing?<eos> We don't know what that thing is, sir.<eos> Actually, we really don't know what any of them are.<eos> Yes. Yes, we do.
(CLANG) BELLATOR:<eos> Wake up, scum. (CLEARS THROAT)<eos> On yöur feet.<eos> (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)<eos> Relax.<eos> If I was going to kill yöu, Celt...<eos> I would have done it already.<eos> What is yöur name?<eos> We will have to speak at some point.<eos> No, we don't.
Something shady, that's for sure.<eos> Let's see if we can get inside and open those doors.<eos> Let's see if we don't do that.<eos> Listen, Chang... you've gotta stop being such a pussy, okay?<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> Dude... I will whoop your little ass.<eos> You will not touch his ass.<eos> I will hit him.<eos> Don't you fucking hit me.<eos> Don't!
How fun is it?<eos> I've done it 11 times.<eos> Eleven?<eos> And I smoked crack once.<eos> Let's go!<eos> No, please.<eos> Don't leave me alone here.<eos> Please, I'm itching.<eos> I've got this post-nasal drip thing going.<eos> Don't do that!
And that absolves you of any responsibility?<eos> No, but some of these guys actually enjoy this.<eos> The rest of us do it out of fear, because if you don't, Taiko will kill you or worse.<eos> Taiko has forced me to do so many things so vile, human trafficking, sex slavery.<eos> Gang rape.<eos> Talk to God.<eos> I'm not interested in your confession.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't leave the video for him to see.<eos> Don't.
- Some of the kids I could've carried.<eos> - You saved so many people, Gale.<eos> Without you, there would be no District 12. Not even the memory of it.<eos> This is where you kissed me.<eos> I didn't think you remembered that.<eos> I'd have to be dead to forget that.<eos> Maybe not even then.<eos> I knew you'd do that.<eos> How?<eos> I didn't.
- If you turn yourself in...<eos> - They'll arrest you as an accomplice.<eos> Witnesses saw both of us with the body in the hotel hallway.<eos> You arranged fake passports for us. - No, no, no, no... - You accompanied us to Crete.<eos> And now you're carrying, what, an extra $1,000 of my money in your pocket?<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> I know.<eos> I know you are.<eos> Did you know he was dead?<eos> Colette doesn't.
Einstein wrote four papers that changed the world by the age of 26.<eos> As far as I can tell, I've... (chuckles) I've barely made par.<eos> - My God, you're serious.<eos> - Would you prefer I made a joke?<eos> Oh, I don't think you know what those are.<eos> Hardly seems fair that that's a requirement for employment here, Mr...<eos> Commander Denniston, Royal Navy.<eos> All right, Mr Turing, I'll bite.<eos> Why do you wish to work for His Majesty's Government?<eos> Oh, I don't, really.
Well my editor needs rewrites, so am I on the right track, or?<eos> Of course you are, Hannah.<eos> Of course you're on the right track.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, you got the deal, you got the check. You're the first one to be published so...<eos> You know, I think what I'm hearing from the group is that you're fine.<eos> We love it.<eos> There's just nothing to critque here.<eos> You don't need us...<eos> Oh yes I do.
Music school in London.<eos> What do you think about that?<eos> Um, I think, why would you do that?<eos> Well, why not?<eos> 'Cause you're already better than anyone there.<eos> 'Cause if any of the teachers at this college had a fifth of your talent, they wouldn't even be there.<eos> Because they're just gonna try and make you sound like some asshole from TV.<eos> Well, I need to go somewhere.<eos> - O, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.

-I didn't.<eos> - I feel like you did.<eos> -l'm sure I did.<eos> You said "kidnapping." I was like, "What a weird word."<eos> - Should be more "kidnabbing."<eos> -No, I did not. Did I say that?<eos> - I think you might have, sir.<eos> -You sure?<eos> Well, I got a little lost with all their yammering, but pretty sure.<eos> All right, maybe I did.
We can't go around 'em:<eos> "Hey, Dubois, don't call me Ozinski, my name's Robert."<eos> Now I spend my whole life doin' that.<eos> - You takin' a whiz?<eos> - Sorry, can't hold it.<eos> Robert was my dad's name, I'm a Junior.<eos> He's not around, though, I don't really know him 'cause he left when I was a baby.<eos> Yeah, my dad's not around either, he did some bad things to my mom and so we left and I haven't seen him in a while.<eos> I kinda miss him, though, my Mom's being a jerk.<eos> They do that, man.
But then you were working as a cocktail waitress if I remember it correctly?<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - We got confirmation.<eos> That's a dirty bomb.<eos> Boss.<eos> Abort.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi sweetie, it's your father.<eos> You didn't forget, which means you probably love me.<eos> Of course I do, Zooey.
estate sale in Rutland?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I checked it online back at the motel.<eos> Lot 75 steel pennies.<eos> I mean...<eos> Look, if you're okay and I can square it with Gaines, do you mind if I stay another day?<eos> More time for me and the pool boy.<eos> - Well, lock up tight.<eos> - Always.<eos> I know you loved your sister, honey.<eos> Yes. Yes, I did.
- No, not yet.<eos> But you know, all good things come to those who wait.<eos> - This is nice.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How long has it been since we've had a... a girl-girl afternoon?<eos> I don't know, a couple of months?<eos> That's right, because you and Bob are so tight. - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how you do it, Darc.<eos> - Honestly.<eos> - Yeah, neither do I.
That was Victor Brady, 42nd Street Productions, and he's coming tonight to see you.<eos> Well, he's just gonna have to see Liz instead.<eos> I know you're still shaken about the accident...<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> I've just realized that this whole thing is not for me.<eos> Camilla, what about everything you've worked so hard on?<eos> What about Artie?<eos> What about him?<eos> He wanted you to play Sofia.<eos> He always did.
Well, it's getting worse.<eos> I think my daughter is in a great deal of pain.<eos> I mean, physically from her recurring nightmares.<eos> It's like she gets these bruises, even... scars, and it happens again and again, dream after dream... meanwhile she stays stuck in her bed all day long.<eos> Okay, I...<eos> I know I should not ask you this... and you'll probably question my behavior as a mother but...<eos> I really need something to inhibit her nightmares.<eos> I can't bear the fact that my daughter is being so affected by her sleep.<eos> You want her to stop dreaming?<eos> Yes I do.
What are you doing? Don't leave me hanging.<eos> Dude, I got to go or I'm gonna blow my cover, okay?<eos> You can do this alone.<eos> I'll be back in two hours. You got this.<eos> You scared me.<eos> This is the place.<eos> You'd think if somebody wants to show us their operation, they'd at least be on time.<eos> Look at this crap.<eos> - I do miss the days... - Shit. - What's he doing here?<eos> - ...when people did normal drugs.
Yeah, he might not survive this.<eos> What's up, homes?<eos> I'm Emilio Estevez Estevez.<eos> Just got out of lockdown for some armed robbery.<eos> This dude here, he's--<eos> Break yourself, fool!<eos> I just got out of lockdown too.<eos> That's right, homes.<eos> Wait.<eos> - No, you didn't.

Call your witness.<eos> The defense calls... - Jimmy Logan to the stand. - What?<eos> In a surprise twist of events, a witness came forward today and ended the prosecution's case against Clinton Davis.<eos> The witness saw the victim, Cecil Ackerman, mowed down by a hit-and-run driver in a red SUV and left on the road to die.<eos> He then called 911.<eos> It seems that Clinton Davis was not the only good Samaritan in this trial.<eos> Mr. Davis?<eos> I just wanted to wish you all the best.<eos> Yeah, it's like you said-- if I was innocent, everything would work out.<eos> Yes, I did.
You want your backstage passes, you're gonna have to take a good, long, hard look at the ass, Cleaver.<eos> What?<eos> Jimmy Junior.<eos> Do it, son.<eos> Then you'll give me my backstage passes?<eos> Look at him. Be a man.<eos> Look at Ricardo.<eos> The vomiting cobra.<eos> The meat monkey.<eos> - Do it.
Cass!<eos> Cass!<eos> Cass!<eos> I have a plan.<eos> A few minutes.<eos> That's all you'll have together.<eos> Do I get to talk to him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Does my Dad get to talk to me?<eos> Yes, Cass he does.
Back in the day, you couldn't catch him.<eos> Very fast.<eos> - Maybe even faster than you.<eos> - No way.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But what am I gonna say?<eos> It's a young man's game.<eos> I need a job!<eos> All I know what to do is killing people!<eos> And I do that very well!
I hear things.<eos> You got a mission. I can help.<eos> My name is Galgo.<eos> Let me fill you in.<eos> I am good. Very good. At warfare.<eos> You know, good memory. Afraid of nothing.<eos> I want to be your friend.<eos> I don't need a friend.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Everybody does.
But it just doesn't matter anymore.<eos> Well, champ.<eos> Thing you did in Abo town is the one thing that does matter to us.<eos> Now you can do all the lying and confessing you'd like.<eos> What feeling do you have when you wake up in the morning?<eos> When your feet touch the floor?<eos> Or before that, when you're lying there thinking about your feet hitting the floor.<eos> What does that feel like for you?<eos> Do you know what I'm talking about?<eos> No, mate. I don't.
That's the same car that Ford and Shelby were building when Carroll died.<eos> I'm looking at a gorgeous ghost.<eos> And I think that's Tobey Marshall inside there, driving a chariot of the gods.<eos> So I bow down to Tobey Marshall.<eos> Dino Brewster is on the line right now.<eos> Dino!<eos> Dino, Dino bambino in San Francisco.<eos> You need to see what I'm looking at.<eos> I'm looking at some aerial footage of Tobey Marshall flying across the country with the cops in tow, in a phantom Ford that will make your bowels loose.<eos> Tobey Marshall doing something stupid and reckless again?
- Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> So, do I have to wake her before we move her to the new ship?<eos> Given that she's in hibernation, do I really have to... ask her permission? I'd hate to bother her.<eos> Plus... she is so slow-moving.<eos> It would be so much less of a headache... if we could ship her in her storage unit with our stuff.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Oh, fantastic.<eos> You know, if it helps, my grandmother was in hibernation for five years.<eos> It doesn't.
Well, Daniel, you are the one that left.<eos> I left because you had to be drunk to make love to me... then you sobbed in your pillow... To make love to me, then you... To make love to me...<eos> - I feel like we have so much in common.<eos> I mean, we're both these fractured people.<eos> You lost your hand in battle and I...<eos> - I am...<eos> I have...<eos> - I...<eos> Yeah...<eos> I didn't...
It will take some getting used to.<eos> I've changed so much that I doubt my own mother would recognise me.<eos> The order finally came through today.<eos> I guess it was inevitable.<eos> By the time you listen to this seven years will have passed.<eos> Our first mission is just as important as our last.<eos> Each one getting us closer to our final destination.<eos> Sir, please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to uphold the rules and regulations - set forth by T.B.R. Code 7286?<eos> - I do.

Code 7286?<eos> - I do.<eos> Do you accept that any diversion from your mission parameters will result in immediate court martial? And if convicted death by lethal injection.<eos> I do.
But I wasn't referring to you, Brett.<eos> Jonathan...<eos> Do you always play with your food?<eos> Not when I can help it.<eos> Keith!<eos> I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I was worried when we talked last night, your phone cutoff.<eos> We didn't talk last night. What?<eos> What do you mean we didn't talk?<eos> Yes we did!
I was...wondering if you knew anything about this?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a letter from the Minister of Justice -about my immigration status.<eos> -How would I know about it?<eos> Well, my visa is contingent on my studies here at this hospital.<eos> You do know that April Latimer's uncle is the Minister?<eos> -I don't know where she is.<eos> -Fair enough.<eos> But if her uncle is trying to kick you out of the country, it suggests that he thinks otherwise.<eos> I don't.
Is she here?<eos> Who is it? !<eos> It's Mr. Matt!<eos> Tell him to go the fuck away!<eos> That's what she says.<eos> I just want to talk to you for a minute!<eos> Tell him, no, he's an asshole.<eos> I didn't say anything yet.<eos> I know what you're gonna say.<eos> No, you don't. Bullshit.
What's wrong?<eos> What happened?<eos> What happened?<eos> I need money!<eos> I'm leaving!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Give it back to him.<eos> She didn't ask for it.<eos> Give it back to him!<eos> She, she didn't...
Mum?<eos> Baby?<eos> - I'm going!<eos> - No, Mum!<eos> Oh yes!<eos> Shit, I can't feel anything.<eos> Marianne, send them away. You brought them.<eos> - I don't want to!<eos> - Nor me.<eos> - I do. - Me too.
Two weeks, and then you two start catching again.<eos> Let's cut to the point.<eos> As the crow flies, y'all are wanting to ask about that big throwdown in the woods, yeah?<eos> Eventually, sure. Right now, we're just trying to track the case.<eos> How Cohle worked it, especially.<eos> Which indicates you think I'm too thick to realize that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.<eos> You're on to something new.<eos> So Cohle didn't want to give it to the task force.<eos> Did you?<eos> No, I did not.
We will be how many for dinner tonight?<eos> Eight.<eos> Cancel.<eos> I thought I cultivated fidelity, but with you, remember?<eos> It all happened very fast.<eos> ...sublime.<eos> There is room to reform.<eos> - Good night, Zizi.<eos> - Hello, Victoire.<eos> - How do you do?
And all you got to do is come on down.<eos> She wide open just jump on in.<eos> What?<eos> I think maybe we too late, Gor.<eos> Norman.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Norman, you sneaky snail.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Wait a second, did you...<eos> Did you...
We didn't say anything for months.<eos> You'll start blaming us at this rate.<eos> OK, Hidayet, come on.<eos> But sending a debt collector so suddenly, is that right?<eos> You could have talked to us first.<eos> Talking exists, doesn't it?<eos> Come on, Hidayet.<eos> How many times did we talk?<eos> How many times did I tell you?<eos> I did, didn't I?
- So get acquainted.<eos> It was getting hairy up there.<eos> You need a big pear to fight back!<eos> Just think, Delphine has 3 kids already.<eos> Do you want kids?<eos> Why?<eos> You want to have kids with me?<eos> The look on your face!<eos> Yes, I want children.<eos> Not yet but, yes, I do.
Hey, I said I wasn't gonna punch.<eos> Fight!<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> What's happening? Ohh!<eos> It's an all-out brawl!<eos> Oh, you hate to see the game degraded to this level, Bill.<eos> Who started this?<eos> Those girls are crazy, Officer. Uh-huh.<eos> One of 'em threatened to violate my nana.<eos> Uh-huh. Sure, she did, son.
Previously on Penny Dreadful:<eos> - What does it say to you?<eos> - Open your lips. Taste.<eos> To the most mysterious thing in London, Miss Vanessa Ives.<eos> I need blood, you fucking devil whore!<eos> Professor Van Helsing.<eos> - Hematophagy, the eating of blood.<eos> Sir Malcolm is looking for a cure for something he doesn't understand.<eos> - Do you?
How long have you known Sir Malcolm?<eos> We only met recently at a social engagement.<eos> When he learned I was a hematologist, he engaged me to consult with you.<eos> So he didn't tell you where the blood was from?<eos> The subject, I mean.<eos> He didn't have to.<eos> Not when I saw your reaction to Hannah's Wink.<eos> Do you know why he wants us to analyze it?<eos> Sir Malcolm is looking for a cure for something he doesn't understand.<eos> Do you?
No, it's creepy.<eos> Yep, we're in creepy town right now... population you.<eos> "A," I have an appointment, and "B," it's too soon.<eos> And "C," are you getting stoned right now?<eos> What kind of appointment?<eos> - It's an acting appointment. - Mm.<eos> - You didn't answer my question.<eos> - An audition.<eos> Rath said that there was a small part that I might be good for.<eos> Oh, Rath did, did he?
- Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Because usually he makes fun of me.<eos> Well, he does that too, but I can tell it's out of love.<eos> There is love.<eos> I do love the guy.<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> I took a bullet for him, you know?<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, I did.
You guys ready?<eos> Ew, he wears cologne.<eos> It's gross.<eos> If my dad finds out, I'm totally getting grounded.<eos> And if your dad doesn't find out, maybe we'll be invited to Ryan's New Year's Eve party.<eos> Maybe we won't go into next semester being the same lame losers we are now.<eos> I don't have to jump off a bus to prove I'm fun.<eos> I'm fun.<eos> I know that.<eos> Just... no one else really does.
I'm glad you can make jokes.<eos> Alex...<eos> I need to do the right thing for a change.<eos> I have to.<eos> And truthfully, you... you can't keep me safe either way.<eos> Left hand, please.<eos> Raise your right.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,<eos> - so help you God?<eos> - I do.
So, after all his talk about liberating humans from the yolk of the Espheni, he just... up and abandoned the whole deal, huh?<eos> Yes. You are correct.<eos> We did abandon you, but the greater Volm force had to go.<eos> And now I feel your pain of displaced loved ones.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Go? Where? My father redirected our fleet to the Alicante 8 cluster.<eos> It is where we hid our brood mates and hatchlings...<eos> Our family... from the Espheni.<eos> Hoping they would escape notice.<eos> They did not.
Look, I've been running from the devil my whole life, Ben.<eos> Been a fighter since the day I was born...<eos> First against my father, then against cancer, against every stinking skitter and mech out there.<eos> I'm still a fighter, Ben.<eos> I'm telling you, there's no fight anymore.<eos> I know you're not crazy, Maggie, but the minute a mech finds this place...<eos> You want to see something crazy, Ben?<eos> A few months ago, a mech did find this place, just after you were injured protecting Lexi.<eos> I wanted to kill it or run.<eos> A lot of people did.
I just hope you're wrong. What difference does it make?<eos> You...<eos> You can still use it for your campaign, right?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> If we use this and we find out later that he was shooting people having sex, that is what's gonna be splashed all over the Internet.<eos> It'll be a PR disaster.<eos> Peeping Tom Vodka.<eos> I am gonna have to go and talk to Nate and see if he has any additional footage that he hasn't shown us.<eos> I told you we make a great team.<eos> We did.
No!<eos> Look who's awake.<eos> You want to finish her off yourself?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Go on.<eos> It's either her, or you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Go on.<eos> It's either her, or you.<eos> Do it.
Look who's awake.<eos> You want to finish her off yourself?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Go on.<eos> It's either her, or you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Go on.<eos> It's either her, or you.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!
Goki, what is it?<eos> I heard you all shouting in there.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> What happened?<eos> You know very well, it's time for me to go.<eos> Go where?<eos> Don't say that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Don't...
I gotta go.<eos> All right, wait here.<eos> No, I wanna go to Cedars right now.<eos> Do what I tell you, you'll be there in a few minutes.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> No.<eos> You were mugged, understand?<eos> Big guy with a hoodie. You didn't see his face, all right?<eos> No, please don't leave me.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
It's so like ali to do this to her.<eos> Honey, we don't know anything about Where alison's been or what she's gone through.<eos> I'm trying to reserve judgment.<eos> Mom, alison was at the center of every mess<eos> That spencer got into. She's a walking time bomb, But it's never all who blows up.<eos> It's everything and everyone else around her.<eos> I understand running away.<eos> But to let your friends and family think You're dead?<eos> I really thought It was alison in that grave.<eos> We all did.
But you can't hide forever.<eos> I'm not hiding.<eos> Matthew.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> And I'm counting on you staying right here.<eos> You?<eos> Keep it down, Garza.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Remember when you were in the rebellion and you convinced your commander to run a flanking move and everybody was captured except you?<eos> Do you?
Get this.<eos> You won't regret it.<eos> Em, I just got your text.<eos> What did your dad say?<eos> It's what he didn't say.<eos> "A" killed my car in the woods last week.<eos> What's next?<eos> We don't know that for sure.<eos> We need more proof.<eos> Do we?
Me?<eos> Sleep is overrated.<eos> Okay.<eos> Actually, could you cover for me?<eos> And then if you're not too busy after school, maybe you could come by and give me your physics notes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mr. Fitz?<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, I did.
Well, would it be any easier if I was at the foot of your bed?<eos> But Jason's not answering, Emily.<eos> He's unloading boxes from his car.<eos> I'm just gonna walk over there and try to talk to him.<eos> Talk to you later.<eos> You're up early.<eos> Yeah, I have to go talk to somebody before school.<eos> Okay, I'll grab my jacket.<eos> No, Dean, you don't have to come.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Get home?<eos> Jason, I haven't heard from you since I left almost half my body in an elevator shaft.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I felt pretty bad about that.<eos> You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Wilden was after me. Wait.<eos> You think Wilden was behind that?<eos> Who else?<eos> Look, I know it hasn't been easy for you.<eos> And so does Spencer.
We have to stay together if we want to stay strong.<eos> OK?<eos> - Is that what he tells players?<eos> - No wonder they keep losing.<eos> - Again?<eos> ! - Dad, can t you fix it?<eos> Marc?<eos> He s awfully calm.<eos> I know. Me, if my kids get a cold I freak out. Does Toni know?<eos> - Of course he does.
- Or you. You suck at school.<eos> - Right...<eos> They are fighting.<eos> When I come home, he barely even talks to me.<eos> - So stop working. I wouldn t have to work if...<eos> - If what?<eos> Why did Toni get that job, and not you? - They offered it.<eos> I refused.<eos> - You refused?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Do you understand, dead in his Car under mysterious circumstances!<eos> The doors were locked from the inside.<eos> Cause of death:a Overdose of his medication.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> That can not be.<eos> Are you saying that have killed my mother?<eos> You have killed her, and you did not know it?<eos> - - No, I did not know. -<eos> - You lie, you bastard!<eos> - - You did it!
She saw nothing. She heard at least two people who giggled.<eos> One of them was a girl.<eos> She fainted.<eos> She woke up an hour later.<eos> Nude.<eos> All her clothes were gone.<eos> May I see.<eos> Carl?<eos> Sunday.<eos> Well done, Henning.
I really hope you finish the book, and I really, really hope I get to read it someday.<eos> Yeah, I don't know.<eos> I mean, now that Millstreet has dropped all of Davids projects,<eos> I just...<eos> I'd have to find a new publisher, so, you know, we'll see...<eos> Wait, you said Millstreet's dropped all of David's projects? Yeah.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Shit. There's David's morn. She's so devastated.<eos> Did you meet her?<eos> - No, I didn't, no.
It's ugly.<eos> It's not a fair place.<eos> I'm happy to have what I have.<eos> I'm glad I have this.<eos> I've thought it all out.<eos> And there's a way to do it so we don't risk any exposure.<eos> Do we have to talk about this now?<eos> I'm beat.<eos> My brain is...<eos> Yes, we do.
Neither do I, but then... I jumped ship.<eos> - So you don't believe in God?<eos> - Didn't say that.<eos> But I would like a fucking word.<eos> Ours is not to question why.<eos> No!<eos> Because, down here, we get to do what we please. Right?<eos> Take him.<eos> Take him down!<eos> - Sarge, I don't...
Werewolf?<eos> All right, guys, look.<eos> About six months ago, I was outside Portland, Maine, hunting this big, bad wolf.<eos> I took him down, but he bit me in the process.<eos> And you didn't call one of us?<eos> And tell you what? That I messed up?<eos> No, I knew the deal.<eos> There's no cure so I accepted my fate.<eos> Ate my favorite dish of Egg Foo Young, watched the world's greatest movie, Rocky Ill, and then was ready to eat a bullet when Bess, here, found me.<eos> And how did she do that?
Hey, do you think that people fetishize thick thighs?<eos> If I was a prostitute, that could be my thing.<eos> He was proud of what he does.<eos> If I'm being honest, it made me totally fucking jealous.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Jealous because people pay him for sex?<eos> When was the last time you heard me call myself an artist?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You say it all the time.<eos> No, I don't.
What are you doing?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, get out.<eos> - You need to chill out.<eos> -I'm chilled out, okay?<eos> Here, smoke this.<eos> I'll drive. You can relax, okay?<eos> You brought pot to my sister's wedding?<eos> To meet my family?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
- You know how they write whatever they please.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - Nevzat, how is your uncle? - He's doing well, doctor.<eos> Didn't get the chance to thank you.<eos> He is doing very well.<eos> Thank you so much for asking.<eos> - You take care of your business. I'll talk to you later. - All right.<eos> Ma'am excuse me, I was about to say....<eos> - So you don't know the individual<eos> - We don't, officer.
He's OK.<eos> But you did wrong tonight.<eos> - He had left his things.<eos> - Don't bullshit me.<eos> Tayfun did wrong. Then the accident happened.<eos> Now, our problem is to prevent anything worse from happening.<eos> Right?<eos> We wouldn't want that.<eos> We wouldn't want that.<eos> Do you?
Go, Gennaro!<eos> Finish him off!<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> I didn't do anything!<eos> Get moving!<eos> Listen good, it's better for you and me if we say you killed him.<eos> Or we'll be in trouble.<eos> Hear me?<eos> You did it!
I coordinate daily service sales activities and regarding distributors.<eos> I also, manage relationships with various accounts and... and... I occasionally assist with marketing programs relating to distributors.<eos> - It sounds really complicated.<eos> - Nah, it isn't.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> You have such a huge dick!<eos> Don presumed his penis to be of an average size.<eos> If his dick had, in fact, been huge, he would probably have heard about it by this point.<eos> You like that?<eos> Do you?
- Everybody cares.<eos> Everybody!<eos> All right, yeah, whatever.<eos> Fucker!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> So what do you want to know?<eos> What do you want to tell me?<eos> What's important in your life right now?<eos> I don't...
Do as I say... if you want to save your life.<eos> Hello?<eos> So what?<eos> Good.<eos> Very well.<eos> Well done.<eos> It's fine. Talk to you later.<eos> Hey.<eos> We have a meeting.<eos> - What did Gennaro Savastano?
And, of course, we'll always keep you updated For the latest on this story.<eos> Rosie, what are you doing here?<eos> I saw the tv.<eos> They were talking about you and mrs. Peri.<eos> Look, I can't talk right now.<eos> I just wanted to see if you were okay.<eos> Not really.<eos> Do you want to go to breakfast tomorrow,<eos> Tell me what happened?<eos> No, I don't.
There's a medical?<eos> What a personality!<eos> Come in, please.<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> You need to understand that what is happening to you is both a great opportunity and a great misfortune.<eos> You're rich. You can buy anything. Give gifts.<eos> But be careful. Why?<eos> You must be wary.<eos> When you have money, people love you.<eos> People already do.
Our pleasure.<eos> You, hungry, thirsty?<eos> I don't need a thing.<eos> You're dressed again.<eos> I am.<eos> You're leaving.<eos> I have to.<eos> No!<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, I... I do.
She never mentioned him to me.<eos> That's strange.<eos> She said she spoke to him.<eos> Said he seemed to have all the answers.<eos> Well, I will find this Dr. Hvit and... See if he can shed any light on the situation.<eos> - I don't know a Dr. Hvit.<eos> - Doreen talked to him. She...<eos> Talked to him?<eos> Doreen told you that?<eos> No, Major Balleseros did.
Here it is.<eos> It's small but functional.<eos> And the bathroom is right next-door.<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> But don't forget it's my house.<eos> No, I'm just kidding.<eos> It's humour, Gloria.<eos> - Do you like humour?<eos> - Humour?<eos> - Do you?
Anywhere you interact with other people opens us up to risk.<eos> I'm just supposed to slave away at the fucking call center and then lock myself in the apartment.<eos> - Don't get dramatic.<eos> - I like the fellowship. Okay?<eos> There there's nothing to worry about there.<eos> All it takes is one person's cousin to visit from Lynchburg.<eos> Someone you went to school with or some client that you spent the night with.<eos> - Those guys would never end up here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yeah. I do.
This time it'll be more than a search.<eos> Destroy everything!<eos> Clothes and jewels.<eos> Strip the walls!<eos> I swear by all that's good that I'd tell you, if I knew.<eos> Spare my house.<eos> Why should I, when my own house has been sacked by that scoundrel Brilhac, who calls himself General?<eos> You're lucky to be alive!<eos> Maurice, tell them, if you know of a hiding place.<eos> I don't, mother.
All right, come on, let's go.<eos> See your girlfriend's got Her cameraman with her. Shut the fuck up.<eos> She's not my girlfriend.<eos> I thought you had An arrangement.<eos> She traded up.<eos> You can film her, not me. Don't touch the lens.<eos> How about i toss you and your Whole fucking rig down the hill?<eos> Sorry.<eos> She said i could shoot Whatever i wanted.<eos> She did, huh?
Did I hurt you'?<eos> No.<eos> Are you angry'?<eos> No.<eos> Will your wife ask any questions?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Does she ever'?
The place was made for Abigail and your world.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> The place was made for all of us, together.<eos> I wanted to surprise you.<eos> And you... you wanted to surprise me.<eos> I have let you know me.<eos> See me.<eos> I gave you a rare gift.<eos> - But you didn't want it.<eos> - I did not.
Come on.<eos> Let's get on with this.<eos> Guess it's a good thing I'm not claustrophobic anymore.<eos> That's what Katherine helped you with...<eos> Silas aftermath.<eos> She did.<eos> - Can I just hate her anyway?<eos> - You can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I don't.
Damon, stop...<eos> Jeremy.<eos> - Whoa!<eos> What the hell?<eos> - I need to see your sister.<eos> Undo my chains or I'll kill him.<eos> - I can't. You'll kill her.<eos> - She's gonna hurt herself, Jeremy.<eos> - She's totally unraveling.<eos> - Don't do it, Jeremy.
Our theme is secrets that people think they're getting away with.<eos> Well, Meryl Streep, I'd love to know how we're gonna act out Watergate.<eos> Well, I'm sure team Stelena will figure it out.<eos> "A," you just implied that I was on your team.<eos> Two, you just gave me that judgy little hinty voice.<eos> So what am I missing?<eos> Speak.<eos> Well, don't you think that Stefan and Elena have been a little...<eos> You know?<eos> No. Clearly I don't.
- Striped mullet.<eos> Never tried it. Very tasty.<eos> Is this the first time they've gone missing?<eos> No.<eos> They have a reputation.<eos> - But they were always home by bedtime.<eos> - What for?<eos> A reputation.<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
That's right.<eos> I wear a hat too.<eos> Does that make me a suspect too?<eos> I won't authorize anything until you bring me something conclusive.<eos> Now please leave.<eos> I'll call you when I hear back.<eos> You're protecting him.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know how things work around here.<eos> Yes, I do.
Abortion calls.<eos> Ma'am, I swear to God, we all thought he was gonna just eat some shrimp, rattle off a few platitudes, go home, watch Full Meta!<eos> Kelly, tell Mike to climb off his wife and get on the speakerphone, now.<eos> Do you know what this is? Let me explain something to you.<eos> This is POTUS trying to screw me, okay?<eos> This is the unflushable turd that is left in the can for the next person, e.g. me.<eos> The toilet's still broken, FYI.<eos> Has POTUS gone nuts?<eos> We can't have a crazy president.<eos> In Italy they do.
Did you take his rabbit, Daryl?<eos> Just tell me the truth.<eos> I didn't take nothing.<eos> What do we got here?<eos> Come on.<eos> - Well, look at that.<eos> - You put that there, didn't you?<eos> When I went out to take a piss.<eos> - You lied.<eos> - Didn't you?
- Hi.<eos> He's a big fan of yours.<eos> I met Tara on the road.<eos> Couldn't have made it here without her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When she heard what I was doing, she said she had to help me.<eos> What's up?<eos> He just said that he knows what caused the outbreak.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He does.
Let's go.<eos> What is this?<eos> Yo.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> - What?<eos> Why? - Close 'em.<eos> Open your lips.<eos> Less.<eos> - T.-<eos> - Do it.
Okay, well...<eos> Meadow said this really amazing thing...<eos> Meadow?<eos> Is that a person?<eos> Yeah, she's my best friend.<eos> Was my best friend.<eos> Anyway, she said...<eos> "Brook, be a grasshopper."<eos> And it just made so much sense, you know?<eos> No, I don't.
Okay, you know, I...<eos> I'm gonna tell Caputo that Mendez is the father.<eos> But that's a lie.<eos> But didn't he have sex with you?<eos> - Yeah. - Okay, so he's a criminal, he deserves to go to prison.<eos> But you have sex with me.<eos> Used to, anyways.<eos> That's different. I...<eos> I love you.<eos> So does he.
"Let's go visit...<eos> Piper in prison... "because that's where she lives... "because things are going so great for her,<eos> "of all of the fucked-up choices that we have made."<eos> You're right.<eos> It's fucked up.<eos> I know that.<eos> Larry knows that.<eos> But we didn't decide to love each other, Piper.<eos> It just happened.<eos> The way love does.
I should head inside now.<eos> Miss Mallon has committed no crime.<eos> She's been tried in no court and has had no due process under the law.<eos> On the word of a few crusaders, she's been shut up in quarantine in a tiny cabin on North Brother Island against her will with the sick and the dying and the diseased, of which she's none of those things.<eos> She wants her freedom.<eos> And I'm here to make certain that she gets it.<eos> Miss Mallon, would you take the stand, please?<eos> Place your hand here, please.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
You know me, Doc, I'm not the kind of guy who loses sleep over rejection by the opposite sex.<eos> - It's a numbers game.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> I had a pretty great time with your cousin last night, which makes it all the more curious when I called her this morning, she had a change of heart.<eos> Seems she decided that because she's a single mom, she didn't want to be hanging around the likes of me.<eos> What do you suppose inspired this revelation, Dr. Hart?<eos> Vivian came to me after your date.<eos> But since I'm not the most objective person on the subject, - ...<eos> I recused myself.<eos> - You did what now?
According to the charges, Rifkin and a few dozen Taliban fighters raided an Afghan village, killing dozens of civilians.<eos> At trial, Rifkin's lawyers claimed it was friendly fire, that the American military destroyed the village, from the air, mistaking it for a Taliban outpost.<eos> The military denied it.<eos> So The Judge thinks Rifkin is innocent.<eos> Guys, that Rifkin case you were asking about -- the investigating officer was the Senior FBI Agent in Afghanistan at the time --<eos> Harold Cooper.<eos> You think this is a coincidence?<eos> Reddington feeds you The Judge, and I'm next on that lunatic's hit list?<eos> - We need to take it seriously.<eos> - No, we don't.
Scrabble, French doughnuts, yoga...<eos> - You're doing yoga?<eos> - I'm signing up for it.<eos> I wanted you to do yoga.<eos> See, I'm showing you.<eos> I can change.<eos> Hey, Johnny, they have tapenade in here, which I love.<eos> I'm getting some on my sandwich.<eos> Do you want some on yours?<eos> Yes, I do.
I will be blamed for the riots.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, I will.<eos> It's because it was my video, and it's my face on it.<eos> Also, people are watching me now.<eos> No one is watching you.<eos> Who's that guy?<eos> That's a teaching fellow.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
But today, I might. So, now, it is.<eos> And you want to know how I feel about it.<eos> You're my partner. Well, I already told you how I feel about hiring him.<eos> This doesn't change that.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Seems like something else is on your mind.<eos> He doesn't just want to work together.<eos> He wants us to keep seeing each other.<eos> And you don't want to risk the one to have the other.<eos> No, I don't.
It's Logan's show now.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> We need to move up our timeline.<eos> Well, I'm buying shares as fast as I can.<eos> I'm talking about a tender offer.<eos> The plan is shock and awe.<eos> If we rush a tender offer, we won't have enough leverage to force people to vote with us.<eos> It's fine to have shock and awe when you're the only one in the game. But Walter Gillis knows we're coming and he got himself an ally.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I do.
Okay.<eos> You've done it.<eos> - I did not like it.<eos> Did not like you?<eos> No, it's not for me.<eos> Look.<eos> Remember when I said two years ago... We had to concentrate? Us all to Swedish House Mafia<eos> I do not know whether we then used drugs.<eos> We need to focus our subsequent and our solo things have to give.<eos> Yes, you did.
I wish I could stay with you... ..and forget it all by the morrow, as I'm sure you would.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Today doesn't exist.<eos> We made it up.<eos> And tomorrow it'll be gone.<eos> Oh, I... I didn't look for this.<eos> And I don't want it.<eos> You're different, Mary.<eos> You really want me, don't you?<eos> (I do.)
Hello there, little man.<eos> - Why did you call? - You're so strong.<eos> - It was stupid of me.<eos> - It was strange, that's all.<eos> We got called out, and it was a guy I arrested back in Copenhagen. Tristan.<eos> A mean son of a bitch.<eos> It turns out he has a baby boy.<eos> The kid was covered in his own shit and piss, freezing cold.<eos> And then, well... I just had to call you.<eos> Yes, I did.
This is a great surprise!<eos> Well, what's a birthday without a surprise?<eos> You got a special girl, Mrs. Hart.<eos> We love your daughter.<eos> Meeting her has been a complete godsend.<eos> And we want to get to know you, too.<eos> Come on. Meet the rest of the family.<eos> Oh, there's more of you.<eos> Come on, that's got to feel good.<eos> Yes, it does.
I love a good wedding.<eos> To the bride and groom.<eos> - Come on, you guys.<eos> - You'll get your turn.<eos> I want him to show us how he does it.<eos> Just wait till the song's over.<eos> It's over.<eos> Come on, Max, show us how you do it.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Both.<eos> I know you're having a hard time believing what...<eos> They changed my memories.<eos> Who's to say they didn't change more?<eos> I say.<eos> I know you, Phil.<eos> And I knew you before.<eos> You know I'd be the first to go down that road if I thought it led somewhere.<eos> Do you believe me, at least?<eos> - Do you?
Clean up your mess, Harley.<eos> What was your son's name?<eos> I said after.<eos> Well, these are actually two separate rooms and we already cleared that one, so...<eos> Andre.<eos> His name was Andre Anthony.<eos> Make sure there isn't a box of cookies hiding in there.<eos> Did you have any other kids?<eos> Rules of the game, my friend.<eos> Did you?
Good night.<eos> John.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Thank you for believing me.<eos> I didn't know if you would.<eos> Mia, come on. I love you.<eos> I will always believe you.<eos> Good night.<eos> You think Father Perez can help us?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Did I say something funny?<eos> You're asking all the wrong questions.<eos> I... am the interface.<eos> If you want to talk to her... just give me a phone.<eos> Will this do?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm- - I'm a bit tied up.<eos> You're not gonna get it just yet.<eos> How do you use the machine?<eos> I don't.
And I got to see my family again.<eos> But over the past year, I've needed to be more...<eos> And I faltered.<eos> But then I stopped you.<eos> Without killing.<eos> You helped me become a hero, Slade.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You think I won't get out of here?<eos> You think I won't kill those you care for?<eos> No, I don't.
A.R.G.U.S.' super Max?<eos> Him, and anyone else we send here.<eos> This battle may be over, but there will be others.<eos> Starting with getting my family's company back.<eos> That's not going to be easy, since you're poor now.<eos> You're going to have to get a job.<eos> If Slade doesn't scare you, that's got to.<eos> Do you know anyone hiring ex-billionaires with superior archery skills?<eos> Hey, why don't I, uh, give you two a second?<eos> Well, you did it.
Sir.<eos> Find the damn key!<eos> You mind getting out of the way?<eos> We're going on a supply run.<eos> Man: Get up.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> Man: I said get up!<eos> Man: Tom Neville.<eos> You know who I am'!<eos> How do you do, Mr. President?
Hey, ladies! Max is single and ready to mingle!<eos> Delivering from the bitter pains of eternal death, the woman was a wicked woman, and she was dead in her own life.<eos> Yea, Lord, pity them who are dead, and give peace and happiness to the living.<eos> Hey, Fruit Brute!<eos> Fruit brute!<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey. You don't remember me do you?<eos> Oh, my God! - I just made an ass out of myself.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I... I do.
My God, she could be one of the infected.<eos> Please tell me you wore a condom when you were banging her.<eos> It's not a virus thing Travis.<eos> It's more of a... "Be careful what you wish for" thing.<eos> I would seriously invest in a hazmat suit, if I were you.<eos> - You're just gonna take off? - Yup.<eos> - You aren't even gonna help me?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Travis, she wants to kill me.<eos> - Sooner or later, all broads do.
Who is she?<eos> Hello?<eos> - So, what now?<eos> - I'm going down to get Julia.<eos> - Wait, what about...<eos> - She wrote the book on viral splicing and RNA binding proteins.<eos> I need her - we need her - to fight this thing.<eos> Alan, we don't know how sick she is.<eos> We don't even know if she can work.<eos> No, we don't.
No... No...<eos> Don't fight.<eos> Don't go anywhere.<eos> Hello, sestra.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Helena, what you doing here?<eos> I followed you from Mother's house.<eos> I shot you. You were dead.<eos> - You were dead!<eos> - Yes, you did.
-Sometimes, yeah.<eos> Be strong, child.<eos> I don't know whose side you're on.<eos> And I know you always put kira first.<eos> And we'll do that now.<eos> But first, we need to get felix checked by a doctor.<eos> Felix? Felix, honey.<eos> You, we have to get you for the toxicology test. -No, not a chance.<eos> I'm fine. -No, love, we can't be sure what you've had.<eos> We don't...
Are you going to stand there all day, Mr. Funt?<eos> I'm here to help. Really?<eos> And where did you get your genetics degree?<eos> I can source another computer. Anything you need?<eos> No, we're good.<eos> Couldn't get my hands on a 6502 processor, but this one shares a chipset with the 65c02.<eos> He's a virgin, in case you couldn't tell.<eos> Aw, shoot-darn.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Oh, but it did, my good man.
Isolating the audio...<eos> Let's see if this works.<eos> Indeed it does.<eos> That's ancient Aramaic.<eos> - "Ancitif cannot be defeated."<eos> - Ancitif?<eos> "Ancitif..." "A powerful demon that has been known to jump between bodies on contact."<eos> "First cited in 1647, when it possessed a group of catholic nuns."<eos> So... this is the demon that wanted me dead.<eos> And likely still does.
- No, you still don't.<eos> Oh, I listen.<eos> Uh, let's see, I got you pregnant.<eos> You can use those embryo cells to heal fast and live forever.<eos> When you do that, you physically become half the man who got you pregnant.<eos> Um, when you are pregnant, you turn into a cross between creatures from our evolutionary past and a corpse.<eos> You could choose to use your adult cells, but then you'd die someday, so...<eos> You know, honey, just because you listen to a few things doesn't make you Oprah.<eos> - It does.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
And she died in my arms.<eos> You're lying.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> So how do you feel about your old man now?<eos> Well, it's short on cover, but it'll do.<eos> He rolls by, we'll hit him from here and over there.<eos> Jason will flank the rest.<eos> Yeah, that'll work.<eos> Got to admit, quite a team.<eos> Uh, no, I don't.
- Look at this.<eos> There's a hidden wall.<eos> It's a passageway.<eos> It's a secret passageway into our bedroom.<eos> Yes.<eos> I finally know what they're doing. It is an old building with old rooms.<eos> There's nothing secret about that.<eos> Don't use that tone with me.<eos> I know what they want, Guy.<eos> I finally do.
We really did. Oh, man.<eos> You nut!<eos> Thought you were gonna hit me with it.<eos> I was. Okay, so how do we get Ray and<eos> - his useless legs out of here? - Well, now, I actually have some thoughts on that.<eos> - Goddamn it.<eos> - I think it's a - pretty good plan, y'all.<eos> - No, it isn't!<eos> We might as well slather ourselves with whatever it is - crocodiles eat, and swim down!<eos> - What do crocodiles
Sorry.<eos> And you don't know how to fluff a pillow.<eos> Oh, go fluff yourself.<eos> Sure.<eos> Abandon me.<eos> - That's how this all started.<eos> - Come again?<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - No, you-you seriously think I'm the reason you're a control freak?<eos> - You seriously don't?
It's too much sometimes.<eos> You know, my reputation is killing me.<eos> It's only because I'm old and still at it.<eos> No, it's 'cause of the way you conduct a test.<eos> There's nobody better.<eos> You always... could always ferret out the truth.<eos> No.<eos> I can't force anyone to reveal the truth.<eos> I can just tell you if they're lying.<eos> You, um, you do a polygraph on this kid for me, off the record?
No, no, no.<eos> She's trying to help me.<eos> She's trying to seduce you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Norman.<eos> Norman.<eos> Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because...<eos> Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> She does not.
Well, you know what they say - life goes on.<eos> I'm a practical man.<eos> I don't believe in indulging in one's own misery.<eos> Ah, Peter, come and join us.<eos> I'm too busy, I'm afraid.<eos> First class secretary!<eos> Doesn't know how to relax.<eos> Sir Aaron, may I speak with you?<eos> You know, if it wasn't for him the Housing Trust would have collapsed long ago.<eos> And sterling work your charity does in Kembleford.
But I was not prepared for or killed, I was not, or '?<eos> So?<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> You stand there as if you're up to something,<eos> - I will kill you,<eos> - You want to kill me?<eos> Come and kill me, Come on!<eos> You are brave,<eos> You are brave,<eos> What do you do?
Are you sure you can trust him?<eos> Cut her.<eos> Cut her.<eos> Please, no.<eos> No. I have a family.<eos> Set me free.<eos> You want me to set you free?<eos> Please, I have a son and a daughter.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Do it.
Yes!<eos> The ebony falcon soars again.<eos> The ebony falcon.<eos> His feathers are muscles.<eos> Let's talk strategy later tonight at my house.<eos> My wife's working late, I'm on daddy duty.<eos> But you're ready for this, right?<eos> I just need to put my precious babies to bed with a story.<eos> The ebony falcon needs to read go, dog, go.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Wait, Amy?<eos> Yeah, I know, I know.<eos> Just keep it on the D.L.<eos> I haven't quite told Karen yet.<eos> God, one of these days all these girls are gonna get together, and pull a dogfight on you guys.<eos> Pull a what?<eos> What's that?<eos> Um, she probably...<eos> Um, was thinking about...<eos> I don't... um, she... um...
- Japanese Mafia?<eos> - Specifically, a guy named Katashi.<eos> Have you been here all night?<eos> Yeah, they won't let me see him because I'm not family.<eos> I told them he doesn't have any.<eos> He's got us.<eos> And I've got a key card.<eos> Be quick.<eos> I thought he'd be healing by now.<eos> So did I.
The older, wiser animal learns the exceptions to the rules.<eos> Listen, you two, all we have to do is stay quiet.<eos> Michio, get back.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> The MPs are coming.<eos> Somebody lose something?<eos> There were supplies stolen off the truck last night.<eos> Anybody here got any ideas what happened?<eos> Merrick.<eos> Just doing my patriotic duty, Corporal.
That's enough.<eos> One more impertinent answer and the Confirmation's cancelled.<eos> If gospel and jazz are worth more to you than God and salvation! It's pointless anyway.<eos> You can get out and walk home or go to your so-called church choir.<eos> Go on, get out and do what you like.<eos> Go to your choir or your friend Rebecca and head out together to a club.<eos> Do what you like!<eos> You hear me?<eos> ls that what you want?<eos> - Do you?
Yeah, a certainty if we go together.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. That's...<eos> You're right about that.<eos> And when you're right, you're right.<eos> On Friday there's chain saw carving and all you can eat.<eos> And on Saturday they roast a pig underground.<eos> I've never had it, but it's supposed to be good.<eos> Oh. I didn't know that you could do that.<eos> On Sundays they do a pie eating contest.
We've got the excitement of both an elimination and a challenge today.<eos> The person who loses the first challenge will be leaving The Island.<eos> Then what will the remaining contestants do?<eos> They will be competing for the grand prize and the winner will go home with the prize, my friends.<eos> Irfan, can I say something?<eos> - Yes, Recep? Go on.<eos> Irfantino, I want to thank you.<eos> As the number one contestant I'll be competing at the no. 1 spot. - Yes?<eos> To show goodwill and friendship I'd like Taylan to take the no. 1 spot and I'll compete as no. 2.<eos> Why do that?
You got it.<eos> Godspeed.<eos> Keep an eye on Colonel Weaver for me, would you?<eos> Where are you, Hal?<eos> Matt, I'm counting on you to be strong.<eos> Don't be afraid to let yourself feel things.<eos> I feel things.<eos> Just got to be tough about them.<eos> Well, you don't have to be so tough all the time.<eos> Yes, you do.
You've reached the office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City.<eos> No one is available to take...<eos> I can't reach Bennett, or anybody.<eos> Why aren't they picking up at the coroner's office?<eos> They got 206 dead bodies, they're probably a little busy.<eos> Captain Redfern?<eos> Thanks for agreeing to meet us.<eos> You bet.<eos> My passengers and crew trusted me to get them to JFK safely.<eos> But I didn't.
Schmidt, that mattress is heaven.<eos> It's pretty good.<eos> See? You don't think I'm scary, do you, baby?<eos> - Oh, whoa! - Oh!<eos> No. Hey, no.<eos> (laughs)<eos> - I was just kidding.<eos> - No. Hey, Caroline, there's something I need to say.<eos> Nick, you don't have to do this. Nick:<eos> No, I-I do.
Ziggy! Ziggy! - They got Flin!<eos> - Who?<eos> Them. They took him and dragged him to their hut.<eos> - Bas?<eos> - Ziggy, I didn't do anything.<eos> He went to get nails and then they caught him.<eos> Ziggy, I didn't know.<eos> How could you do this? Ziggy!<eos> Ziggy, I swear, I...<eos> I didn't do anything!
I've traipsed<eos> All over europe, pulling him out of this scrape or that,<eos> Each time worse than the last.<eos> But we're all my parents have left.<eos> I can understand both sides, if you want the truth.<eos> I am familiar with feeling adrift.<eos> And with being let down by a brother I loved. I'm sorry.<eos> Truly, I am.<eos> I know they thought they were saving my life,<eos> Or at least mary did.
Because I was too ashamed.<eos> I sacrificed saving your prince for my ship.<eos> I am so sorry, Ariel.<eos> You're a coward!<eos> And a monster!<eos> You let a man die for your ship?<eos> ! What kind of person does that?<eos> The kind who's empty, who believes that a ship can fill a void left by a broken heart.<eos> And that makes it okay?<eos> ! No, it doesn't.
I gave them the exact route.<eos> There were people who saw me, there's CCTV along the way.<eos> So if they check up, they'll see it's true.<eos> Are you pleased with me?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> - Why are you being like this?<eos> - Like what?<eos> I'm protecting you.<eos> I don't need your protection.<eos> Yes, you do.
- At the BBG.<eos> - He's acting like he doesn't even know you.<eos> - Yeah, that's because he doesn't.<eos> Listen, Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?<eos> - I'm on my way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So...<eos> -...should I use this on you?<eos> - Uh... How much does it say to use?<eos> It doesn't.
Yeah, that's him.<eos> Well, when the shit hit the fan at the BBG last week Mr. McNeil he got a bunch of the townsfolk all riled up and together they took the law into their own hands.<eos> Was my mama one of them?<eos> No, that--<eos> No.<eos> No, she was not.<eos> She was one of the good folks.<eos> Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I sure did.
- Really.<eos> - Studying for what?<eos> - For the S.A.T.s.<eos> That test is in November.<eos> - Something to drink? - Surprise me.<eos> Something stiff.<eos> You know, your father and I aren't morons.<eos> We know what it looks like when someone's been [Softly] smoking pot.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> First of all, no you don't.
I will be blamed for the CIA chiefs death.<eos> I will be blamed for the riots.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> Because it was my video and it's my face on it.<eos> Also, people are watching me now.<eos> - No one is watching you.<eos> - That's a teaching fellow.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Uh, you go, I'll stay.<eos> You sure?<eos> All right.<eos> Good night, then.<eos> Good night.<eos> Fara...<eos> Fara.<eos> Night shift's coming out.<eos> I need a bathroom.<eos> Not yet, you don't.
Hey, Cam, hold off on that thing for a second.<eos> Lily, honey?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> It's all in good fun.<eos> All right. Good.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Who's this little dumpling?<eos> Only my niece.<eos> If there's one thing she loves, it's piggy-back.<eos> No, I don't. Yep!
Heed me.<eos> Give me the heart.<eos> No.<eos> And who is this?<eos> Roland! Go back!<eos> - Come here, little boy.<eos> - Don't!<eos> Please.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I really don't.
Cannot draw or sculpt, or carve anything.<eos> Want to know how pathetic I am?<eos> In middle-school woodworking, I had to steal another boy's project to pass the class.<eos> How sad is that?<eos> We all have different talents.<eos> I'm sure you did not rise to your... position... through sheer luck.<eos> Quite right.<eos> Managing people- that's my talent.<eos> Picking the right person for the right job.<eos> Just as I did with you on this project.
- Anyone else with them?<eos> - Not that I know.<eos> Do you know where your brother's truck is?<eos> A 2004 Chevy Silverado...<eos> I know what it is.<eos> It's not here.<eos> He drove it last night.<eos> Now, your brother's friend, was he a Lausenschlange too?<eos> - I don't know what you mean.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Oh yeah? And turning into a cougar is to get a reaction too?<eos> A what?<eos> A cougar! Your mother is a cougar!<eos> Because you don't know the whole story.<eos> She has a new boyfriend. And he's your age.<eos> Your mother is a cougar!<eos> Calm down.<eos> I spent my life with a cougar and you want me to calm down?<eos> Your mother's a cougar. She screws young men!<eos> What if I did the same?
They always do.<eos> I made a deal with something. It said it was a God, but now I'm not so sure.<eos> You shot yourself in the head.<eos> More like the neck.<eos> Barrel slipped.<eos> I taught you better than that.<eos> Don't do that again.<eos> I deserved to die.<eos> Hey! Stop talking like that.<eos> Anyway, you didn't.
- I'll find it. - You have it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That was it, that was the one!<eos> So pick it up, pick it up<eos> Sorry.<eos> Do you need a minute?<eos> Zoe, Look. I'm sorry.<eos> - Hon, look at me.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Don't do that, please.
Is that what you want, huh?<eos> Please.<eos> God, that is not you, Miles.<eos> That is not you, and you know it.<eos> So what are you fighting for, huh?<eos> Tell me.<eos> What do you want, Miles?<eos> Come in.<eos> You wanted to see me, sir?<eos> Yes, I did.
Oh, this was my favorite coverlet.<eos> Add it to the list of my debts to you.<eos> - You're mistaken, my lady, I never... - Please. My friend needs your compassion.<eos> It's dangerous, casting off a babe.<eos> I understand.<eos> No.<eos> Truly dangerous.<eos> Not just to your reputation.<eos> I was warned many girls don't survive.<eos> You did.
Next time I agree to chair an Art Walk, please... It happened again.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> One second, I'm at Grayson Manor, and the next, I come to on my porch with this.<eos> What the hell did you do?<eos> Destroyed my father's carving.<eos> - At least it wasn't someone.<eos> - This time.<eos> - I thought you had these blackouts under control.<eos> - Yeah, so did I.
Are all of them your wives and children?<eos> - Masha, don't. - Don't what?<eos> I didn't know it would end this badly.<eos> How else could it have ended?<eos> They've been stealing for years. They sucked the town dry.<eos> Did you go there to preach and open their eyes?<eos> Did you expect them to start righting their wrongs?<eos> Saving people?<eos> - For them other people do not exist!<eos> - For me they do!
- failure to thrive.<eos> - Have you cuddled him?<eos> No, I have not.<eos> Well, if I were left in a cardboard box, all I'd want is cuddling, right?<eos> Oh, I think I'd want a cardiac cath to confirm I've had a coarctation of my aorta.<eos> He is like a puzzle that I can't solve...<eos> - Oh, whoopsie!<eos> - If you're gonna do that.<eos> Do you have a coarctation of your aorta?<eos> Do you?
♪ Lots of hairy boxes God, I've fallen. ♪<eos> Almost below you now, Nick.<eos> Fellow passengers, stuck in the caboose of life.<eos> You think I'm in the caboose of life?<eos> You love it in the caboose, not me.<eos> It hurts.<eos> It's actually quite jarring.<eos> ♪ Loves it in the caboose<eos> - I don't love it in the caboose.<eos> - ♪ Yes, he does. Uh, hi.
I have no fight with you taking an opportunity when it comes.<eos> These gents and ladies, they come a-wandering down here, as if our lives were naught but a fairground sideshow.<eos> To my mind, they are ripe for a fleecing, and you, son, would not be sat there were that all we thought you tangled in.<eos> Your Ida lies dead, naked as the day she were born, her skinny ribs plundered with the sharpest of knives...<eos> ..and you the cause of it.<eos> Not me.<eos> No, I done nothing.<eos> You find me a soul to say otherwise.<eos> But they do say otherwise, Tom.<eos> They do now, leastwise.
No.<eos> What is it?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Well, the boy, Tammas, he's Mrs. Fitz's nephew.<eos> When you say "seized with evil," what exactly do you mean?<eos> Is he ill?<eos> He's not ill.<eos> He's possessed.<eos> Do you not believe in demonic possession, Claire?<eos> Do you?
I should have called last night and I didn't.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did something happen?<eos> No, no, I'm fine.<eos> It's just... 'Cause you left to talk to Vincent, and then...<eos> I know, uh, but...<eos> What, is this an interrogation?<eos> Look, I know, given your relationship with Vincent, this can't be an easy thing to do.<eos> I intended to.<eos> I did, but, um...
Look... I can't keep protecting you against him.<eos> Protect?<eos> I don't need you to protect me from anything.<eos> I'm sorry, that's not what I meant.<eos> Yes, it is. Be honest.<eos> Okay, you want honesty?<eos> You may think that Vincent has changed, you may even believe that he actually has, but I used to be what he is, and I know sooner or later, he is going to hurt you...<eos> Gabe and you will be sorry! Gabe, please.<eos> The only thing I am sorry about is that things didn't work out between us, because I cared about you.<eos> I still do. Sure.
Lester!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Police officer!<eos> Halt!<eos> She's awake.<eos> What happened?<eos> Um, you got shot.<eos> Go outside, now, okay?<eos> Why?<eos> Just do it.
Mickey Mouse, meth and mullets.<eos> Let the Cubans have it.<eos> So, what's on the docket for tomorrow?<eos> Well, in the morning, I got to be there when they run Mom's carcass through the incinerator.<eos> Then, to keep the party going, I thought I'd hit the Art Institute.<eos> Glad I'm working.<eos> Art museums.<eos> Just a way for perverts to look at nude babies with wings.<eos> Oh, Peg, the world changes.<eos> You never do.
I mean, you're-you're just gonna throw away 50 years of friendship?<eos> Watch me.<eos> If I can do it to a sister, I can do it to her.<eos> Mike has an aunt?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Are you through?<eos> No. And neither is Kay.<eos> You know, your best friend is at a funeral home saying good-bye to her mother right now.<eos> And she wants you there.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Watch me.<eos> If I can do it to a sister, I can do it to her.<eos> Mike has an aunt?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Are you through?<eos> No. And neither is Kay.<eos> You know, your best friend is at a funeral home saying good-bye to her mother right now.<eos> And she wants you there.<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> Yes, she does.
- I think your mother's a lesbian, or... or at least technically bisexual.<eos> Okay, shh!<eos> - Shhh! Take it easy. - [groaning]<eos> I'm here, I'm here. Okay. - Okay.<eos> - It's coming, it's coming. Man: Good news, folks.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> As heart attacks go, this was pretty mild. More of a wake up call to ditch the cigarettes and take up jogging.<eos> I've been telling him that for years.<eos> He doesn't listen to me.<eos> He doesn't...
Hey. Oh, um... sorry about the sweaty hands,<eos> I-I'm really nervous.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And, uh, this is our attorney, Steve Curtis.<eos> We can discuss my fee later.<eos> Please, come, sit down.<eos> - You have a lovely home.<eos> - Not really, but thank you.<eos> So... you want to adopt a baby.<eos> Yes, we do.
He's not under oath, but you'll know if he's lying.<eos> And these cases, they were all in moot court.<eos> Imagine what he'll bring down on you when the stakes are real.<eos> I can tell you this much, it'll be a hell of a lot more expensive than that settlement.<eos> Stemple, we're done.<eos> Reginald, you did a great job making it so I couldn't get out of it, but you should have picked a better case to trap me in.<eos> Because we both know that my independent analyst will come up with anything that I want him to say.<eos> Did you hear what he just said?<eos> I sure did.<eos> And if you did, and I did...
- We don't get high...<eos> - Understood?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Dude, do not Instagram that.<eos> The cops can trace that shit.<eos> You're gonna get busted, Jill.<eos> Your dad already knows you took it.<eos> - Did you tell him I took it? - No.<eos> But he does.
Well, in that case, I'd very much like to take you up on it.<eos> Joan, you look amazing.<eos> One of these days, you're gonna have to tell me your secret.<eos> You know there's no secret, Elana. It's about living right.<eos> Making smart decisions.<eos> You changed your hair.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Kind of needed a change.<eos> Of course you did.
- Nailed it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Hank.<eos> - Hey, Aaron.<eos> You want to hit?<eos> Uh, yeah, I just don't have a racket, sneakers, or talent.<eos> Give me one lesson, and you can start hustling on the doctor circuit.<eos> How about we do business first?<eos> I got the results from the physicals.<eos> Almost everyone did great.
Uh, well, since my house is empty, I thought I would go there and catch up on work.<eos> Right. Um...<eos> Before you do...<eos> Jeremiah, I-I don't know if I ever thanked you for taking over and... and running Hankmed while I was gone.<eos> It... it was a great responsibility, which I-I took very seriously.<eos> I know.<eos> Last summer...<eos> We had our issues.<eos> Do you think we can ever get back to where we once were?<eos> - No, I don't. - Oh.
- I've no idea.<eos> Listen, mate. Don't wait for me.<eos> Go to Brussels.<eos> Make the transfer there.<eos> Mr Halimi, please.<eos> It's useless.<eos> Mr Halimi, please.<eos> Did you hear?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You did?
Just finished rehearsing for a new production.<eos> A small theater but a big role.<eos> He was looking forward to being back on the boards.<eos> Nothing unusual?<eos> No.<eos> What about Jeremy?<eos> What about Jeremy?<eos> Well, had you seen him recently?<eos> You know how it was between them.<eos> Yes, I do.
My name... is Joe.<eos> Bey.<eos> Well, according to your rap sheet, it's Kurt.<eos> Greenlee.<eos> Kurt Greenlee is a slave name issued to me by a corporate entity.<eos> I don't recognize the U.S. Government, so stop saying it.<eos> Call me Joe Bey.<eos> Mr. Bey, we know that Eugene MacIntosh is an associate of yours.<eos> If you say so.<eos> Actually, I don't; his brother does.
When were you gonna tell me about Alistair?<eos> His son Jeremy came here last night.<eos> He was upset about some things you said to Ian.<eos> I told you the truth.<eos> Alistair's heart stopped beating.<eos> Because of a heroin overdose, a massive heroin overdose.<eos> I know that he was found with a needle in his arm. I know it all.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> It must be nice, knowing it all.<eos> I myself do not.
You know what?<eos> I feel sorry for that Bart MacIntosh.<eos> He said his farm was already on the ropes and it wasn't doing well, and now this.<eos> How unwell was it?<eos> He said the only thing keeping it afloat was subsidies from the government.<eos> Remind me to thank your mother next time I see her, will you?<eos> For what?<eos> Well, we made an assumption when we realized that the anthrax was in Eugene MacIntosh's clutches.<eos> That he wanted to kill people.<eos> What if he didn't?
What are you talking about?<eos> It's a celebration.<eos> It's fun and games and free stuff for the baby.<eos> - I don't need it.<eos> - Okay. May I ask why?<eos> I decided to give the baby up for adoption.<eos> - I'm kind of liking these people.<eos> - Jeff and Suzanne Taylor.<eos> Bonnie: So... you want to adopt a baby?<eos> - Yes, we do.
- Of course I do, but I also care about my life with Rachel.<eos> I don't want to live my life like this anymore.<eos> Then you better be the best goddamn investment banker this city has ever seen.<eos> Scottie, I'm sorry I was angry in your direction, but it was really about something else.<eos> Let me guess, Donna explained your feelings to you, and now you're here to apologize.<eos> Maybe.<eos> What was the something else?<eos> Mike got a job offer.<eos> And you don't want him to do it.<eos> No, I don't.
Gentlemen, please do not look, But that woman stirring the bowl over there Seems to fancy one of you.<eos> I said don't look.<eos> Oh, aye.<eos> She's a pie-eater, that one. Mmm-hmm.<eos> Well, I'll just be settling my cock to roost in that tonight.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> We said everra man for himself during the gathering.<eos> Aye, we did.<eos> But ye ken how much I fancy a hen with a bit of meat.<eos> Who doesn't?
Hurry, or we'll be dead before tomorrow.<eos> Observe, child, the quintessence of devoted marriage, how carefully I attend to my dear husband's toilet And how fearlessly he exposes his throat to my blade.<eos> Come along, miss Mercy.<eos> Leave her.<eos> Take him with you, tituba.<eos> One's too few, and three's too many.<eos> Your eyes... So filled with want.<eos> The hard part's not getting what you want, child.<eos> The hard part's knowing what you want.<eos> But I do.
I love you.<eos> Alpha Oscar Three Charlie Zulu, come in.<eos> Alpha Oscar Three Charlie Zulu, come in?<eos> Unknown caller, by failing to identify yourself, you are conducting an illegal radio transmission.<eos> Oz Turner?<eos> I-I-9-9-R-C.<eos> There is no caller by that handle at this location.<eos> Over.<eos> Mr. Turner, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
- There's alarms going off...<eos> - What?<eos> ...freezing seawater up to your ankles.<eos> Adults are screaming, babies are crying! Go, go, go, go, go!<eos> You're up on deck!<eos> There's an Italian guy strapping chains together!<eos> - You don't know what's going on!<eos> - I know! - What do you do?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> What do I do?
My therapist prescribed that I have meaningless sex to take care of my codependency issues.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, look, look, obviously, you know, I can't... condone this kind of behavior.<eos> But, you know, if you... if you think it's... helping you, I mean, that's really the important thing.<eos> It is helping.<eos> I feel so free.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have sex with a woman who never wants to see you again?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
We... we have to regulate the construction density. What?<eos> The construction d...<eos> What time are you... what time are you meeting the mayor?<eos> 2:00.<eos> Can I tell you my points again?<eos> Mom, I've heard them many times.<eos> - You know them.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know, and George told me not to focus on the information.<eos> - George did?
Maybe I'm just doing it for the love of the job.<eos> They're paying me a lot.<eos> Take a picture, it'll last longer.<eos> Hey, hey, uh, I don't suppose your animals do any tricks?<eos> What's that?<eos> I mean, you wouldn't happen to have, you know, a horse that counts or a sheep that juggles?<eos> I mean, anything to sell tickets.<eos> Juggling sheep, huh?<eos> See that little goat over there?<eos> He does a pretty neat trick.
- Yeah, I'll be fine.<eos> It's just me and a house full of hookers.<eos> I've been training for this moment my whole life.<eos> Hey, Charlie.<eos> Your car's parked out on your front lawn.<eos> - How the hell did it get there?<eos> - That's where I left it.<eos> - You took my car?<eos> - Don't accuse me like that.<eos> Yes, I did.
Explain her memory loss, and the fact that she hasn't aged in decades.<eos> Maybe the dome sent her.<eos> It sent my mom.<eos> No, Melanie's a person.<eos> - The dome sent an avatar; you can't grab an avatar.<eos> - Okay, whatever she is, let's not manhandle her.<eos> And since there's no way she's actually Melanie Cross, then we probably shouldn't call her that.<eos> Then what should we call her?<eos> I should know what my name is.<eos> But I don't.
Ashley Cowgill?<eos> Is this your wife? Yeah, she's...<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What's going on?<eos> OK, Ashley, I'm arresting you on suspicion of abduction and demanding money with menaces.<eos> What? !<eos> You don't have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.<eos> Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Are you with me, Ashley?<eos> Have you taken that in? I haven't...<eos> I didn't...
Richard, I just wanna say, I really respect what you're doing here.<eos> And if you could ever use someone with my business-development skill set, - I would love to be a part of this.<eos> - The fuck you will be.<eos> We'll call you when we want pleated khakis.<eos> You know this is a fucking domestic?<eos> Why were you so mean to him?<eos> He wasn't spying on us.<eos> He just said he likes us.<eos> - He wants to join the company.<eos> - Of course he does, Richard.
Really?<eos> What's changed?<eos> Well, a few days have passed.<eos> Your drug tests came back clean.<eos> I'm still getting a bunch of sideways looks, Casey.<eos> I don't want to deal with it.<eos> To hell with them.<eos> We all know you didn't do anything.<eos> Do you know that?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
- What do you mean?<eos> - Don't bother him.<eos> He'll know.<eos> Come here.<eos> Chevalier Blanc has started Chevalier Noir.<eos> That's "night," or "black."<eos> Either way, it's the opposite of Blanc.<eos> And we're supposed to work up print based on this voiceover tagline, "More horsepower."<eos> And you gotta see the words, but it ends with a freeze-frame.<eos> What does?
Jason told his dad he had to drop something off to a friend in Philly.<eos> Could that be code for New York?<eos> What is this?<eos> Mrs. D wrote that email the night that she escaped town, but she never sent it.<eos> It says, "I can't protect you anymore".<eos> Who would she have written that to?<eos> What's up, Jason?<eos> I just saw what you delivered.<eos> Your dad asked my mother...<eos> Yeah, well, my mother didn't.
You're not alone.<eos> Neither is Bo, ever.<eos> She's alone right now, Winter, somewhere.<eos> If that Dani girl hurts her... that is not going to happen.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> 'Cause I think I know where Dani took her.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait.<eos> We want the same thing, you know.<eos> No, we don't.
Is that a no? Mm-hmm.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Is that no? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry to make you wait.<eos> Yeah, in the middle of the night.<eos> So, you brought the serum?<eos> Actually, I didn't. - Right. Because none of this is real, right, Gabe?<eos> Look, I'm not doing this story.<eos> I don't believe Vincent's a beast, or that they even exist.<eos> Well, they do.
Yes.<eos> Is that so difficult to believe?<eos> That an art expert would find your observations on the work of Piero della Francesca impossible to resist?<eos> Yes. It is hard to believe!<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> Cora.<eos> You said what you think, and you have every right to do so.<eos> Tell me, does Edith seem very distracted to you?<eos> I'm not sure I'd notice.<eos> Well, she does to me.
Hanna?<eos> Look, there's no rule that says you have to walk into school with her tomorrow.<eos> Well, it's not written down but it's understood.<eos> We're gonna walk down those hallways with Ali and everyone will think what they've always thought.<eos> Which is what? That we're her puppets.<eos> But you're not.<eos> So who cares what they think? Hey.<eos> People know who you are, Hanna.<eos> They do?<eos> 'Cause lately I don't.
Harmon Kryger broke in an hour ago.<eos> He stole confidential information.<eos> I told you he was alive, that he reached out to Molly.<eos> That is it.<eos> That is all I know.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time.<eos> What did Molly tell you this morning?<eos> You think she knew about this?<eos> Oh, I think it's possible you did too.<eos> - No. No, I didn't.
We'll sit by the fire with all our children around us and I'll make certain that you are safe.<eos> I wonder.<eos> We both want it so much<eos> - but do you believe it'll really happen?<eos> - I do. With all my heart.<eos> Actually, I'm not sure about having children all around us.<eos> How many are you planning on, Mr Bates?<eos> You nearly missed me.<eos> You never told me you were going.<eos> - Who did? - Daisy.
Doesn't matter.<eos> Well, it sounded like you are making plans to go somewhere.<eos> Were you?<eos> I can't live in a world where I jump every time the doorbell rings. So what?<eos> You're just gonna run away?<eos> Please don't tell the girls or try to stop me.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Say that you were kidnapped again?<eos> Do you think I want to live like this?<eos> Because I don't.
I was almost back again.<eos> We're going down.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> (Rattling)<eos> Come here.<eos> Nothing happens to you.<eos> But...<eos> Thank you.<eos> I like to do it.<eos> Do not do it better.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to be in Indianapolis.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because we're presenting to Burger Chef Monday morning.<eos> I know the astronauts may not make it, and then what are we gonna say?<eos> Oh. I'm sorry.<eos> - They're going to be fine.<eos> - It's not fair! You know what? I'll give you the key and you can come down and watch yourself.<eos> Just don't use the stove again.<eos> I don't wanna go to Newark.<eos> - Nobody does.
That's a fucking lie.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> If she went into witness protection, she was gonna send me a postcard. She never did.<eos> No, missy, she's dead.<eos> Asking if you were all in, that was wrong.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do.<eos> I think it's sexy.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
- It's a silly superstition.<eos> It will protect from the evil spirits.<eos> I don't need protecting, Nainai.<eos> - Yes, you do, you silly boy.<eos> - Eat something.<eos> - Mum, we just had dinner. - Eat!<eos> - I'm fine too, if anyone's interested.<eos> Come on, Mum.<eos> You don't all have to check on me every ten minutes.<eos> Yes, we do.
- All good.<eos> - OK.<eos> We've already searched the surrounding bushland, sir.<eos> I don't see where he could have gone.<eos> Something happened here. How much longer is this gonna take, Detectives?<eos> Has it spread any further?<eos> It's up to my chest now.<eos> - It's hard to breathe.<eos> - We have to get him out of here.<eos> - How do we do that?
I'll figure something out, OK?<eos> - Ellen!<eos> - Don't follow me.<eos> Come on, Jake.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Where'd they all go?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> - You look familiar.<eos> - So do you...
No! No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Listen up, everybody!<eos> The court, in appreciation of the defendant's cooperation, hereby pardons Sean Keegan.<eos> - No, but you have to let my wife go, too! - Get him out of here!<eos> No, Sean!<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> Don't!
- There's things I can do.<eos> -Such as?<eos> Sweep the sand away.<eos> I give the money to my mother.<eos> How is that my concern?<eos> Are you gonna cry?<eos> No.<eos> Take that off.<eos> Leave it with Whiting before you go.<eos> MARGARET: How do you do?
-Such as?<eos> Sweep the sand away.<eos> I give the money to my mother.<eos> How is that my concern?<eos> Are you gonna cry?<eos> No.<eos> Take that off.<eos> Leave it with Whiting before you go.<eos> MARGARET: How do you do?<eos> ARQUIMEDES: How do you do?
It's in Trenton.<eos> Whose house is that?<eos> Nobody's house.<eos> Is it a school?<eos> Is it an orphanage?<eos> My name is in that book.<eos> If you take it, you're stealing from me and you're certainly no gentleman.<eos> I need you to pull all the prostitution cases north of 110th Street.<eos> You need me to?<eos> Mr. Hodge does.
My name is in that book.<eos> If you take it, you're stealing from me and you're certainly no gentleman.<eos> I need you to pull all the prostitution cases north of 110th Street.<eos> You need me to?<eos> Mr. Hodge does.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I don't make the assignments.<eos> Would it be any different if you did? Yes.<eos> I know you're good at your job.<eos> Mr. Hodge does, too.
I know what you mean. [Chuckles]<eos> How close were you with Vicky?<eos> Not... very.<eos> Uh, I mean, colleagues, you know?<eos> Personally, we didn't socialize or anything like that, if that's what you mean.<eos> I-I have some trouble connecting with this generation.<eos> See, I was at the opera when I... heard the news... with my wife.<eos> [Elevator bell dings] Henry: They were having an affair.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - Of course we do.
Is it phenytoin?<eos> - Or some other anticonvulsant?<eos> - I don't have to answer that.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - Dr. Morgan, this is not the time.<eos> Okay, H-Henry, let's go.<eos> This is important.<eos> The case depends on it.<eos> Do you take phenytoin?<eos> Yes, millions of people do.
Which is why I'm not looking to advertise the fact that I once had an affair.<eos> You're not advertising it.<eos> You're disclosing it to counsel.<eos> Okay, look, you want the truth?<eos> I'm not proud of the way I was back then.<eos> The way I treated Allison, the way I treated you.<eos> But I'm not that person anymore, and I don't want people to think that I am.<eos> And I understand that, but I work for Harvey, and I can't keep things from him that he needs to know.<eos> - He doesn't need to know this.<eos> - Yes, he does.
Not Mikael.<eos> Your real father.<eos> Is that your best shot?<eos> You'll have to do a lot better if you're gonna kill a Hybrid.<eos> Stop.<eos> Jackson?<eos> Hayley-<eos> I see you met my friend Ansel.<eos> - You know her?<eos> - Yeah, actually. I do.
You said you would, and you didn't.<eos> So either do what I'm asking, or I'll do it myself.<eos> You can't do it, Harvey.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> Logan's gonna do it anyway.<eos> At least this way it'll be me.<eos> What's the difference if you hire somebody to look into Mike or Logan does?<eos> You know damn well they're gonna uncover his secret.<eos> I don't know that, and you don't either.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Hey.<eos> You ready to get down to business?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> - Good.<eos> I was thinking that maybe we could do all this over lunch.<eos> It's 10:30.<eos> There's a lot to discuss, Jessica.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> We need to bury them in paperwork.<eos> No, we don't.
Pull it back.<eos> I'm-I'm trying, but it won't come back up.<eos> I thought you said you knew how to fly it. I do!<eos> Damn it.<eos> We've lost the signal.<eos> I'm sorry, Julia.<eos> It's my own fault.<eos> When you guys started talking about tunnels, I just really wanted...<eos> I really wanted to believe there was a chance.<eos> We all did.
- She was having trouble breathing.<eos> She just passed out.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know we've screwed up.<eos> Over and over again.<eos> But even with everything that's happened, I still choose to believe you're trying to protect us.<eos> I think that when you... stopped moving, that was your way of giving all of us another chance, so I need to ask you for one more thing.<eos> Please help Melanie.<eos> She deserves to live.<eos> Everyone in here does.
Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.<eos> There's an argument for that.<eos> But I want to make sure.<eos> Smile.<eos> Okay. On the count of three, I'll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne.<eos> Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit.<eos> Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.<eos> Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?<eos> Do you want the fire extinguisher?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Whether it's a long time or a short time, I just want to spend it with you...if you'll have me.<eos> That sounds like --<eos> It is.<eos> My God.<eos> I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.<eos> But will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wait.<eos> How do we know we're doing the right thing?<eos> We don't.
Here, take the paint.<eos> Come on, we'll have some fun.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> - What do I do?<eos> - Do a tag.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Come on, Darbois will freak out.<eos> - Darbois doesn't give a damn.<eos> - He does. Go ahead.<eos> Do it yourself.
But the police think that we all had something to do with this.<eos> When Melissa saw Bethany, she was wearing Alison's clothes.<eos> Another set of Alison's clothes. There had to be a duplicate set.<eos> Ali wasn't walking around naked.<eos> Are you saying it was always someone's idea that Bethany take Ali's place? Tell me another way that Bethany ends up in that yellow top.<eos> We need to figure out a way around that picture of "A"<eos> at the hospital or we're busted. What picture of "A"?<eos> Picture of Alison.<eos> No, you said a picture of "A".<eos> No, I didn't.
Give us an hour.<eos> You got 15 minutes.<eos> You called Lydia?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because Meredith asked for her or because of the other thing?<eos> What other thing?<eos> The psychic thing.<eos> You think Lydia's psychic?<eos> Do you?<eos> No, I do not.
Are you still a Kitsune?<eos> Technically.<eos> These are your grandmother's ashes.<eos> Grandma died in Eichen House.<eos> Your father had a difficult relationship with his mother.<eos> But after the things she said, and the way she acted...<eos> He thought she was crazy.<eos> Well, she said she heard things.<eos> Why did she want her ashes in here?<eos> Well, actually, she didn't.
The execution-style murders occurred over 72 hours ago, and still no suspects have been arrested.<eos> The L.A.P.D. have been tight-Upped as to who they are investigating.<eos> Mr. Brown, any comments, sir?<eos> This is a tragedy.<eos> The loss of two great talents.<eos> We gotta do something in this country about gun violence.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> That was Cookie Brown, clearly distraught in the wake of these horrific events.<eos> And while little is known about the night in question, the friends and family of these two talented artists have found refuge...<eos> How you doing, sweetheart?
- I can't forget about this dream.<eos> - Why does it worry you?<eos> - It's difficult...<eos> With you, I can be frank.<eos> - I have a nephew...<eos> - I know.<eos> You love him, you tell us about him.<eos> Our words can contradict our thoughts.<eos> Out of family duty, I say I love him.<eos> When you actually don't?
It's a waste of time.<eos> You know they'd rather cop a beating than lag.<eos> Well, I'm surprised she wouldn't talk to you.<eos> Look, Will, it's...<eos> It's not my place to judge, but... I heard what her ex-husband said to you.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Have I backed the wrong horse?<eos> No.<eos> Doyle?<eos> She doesn't do her own dirty work.
And his child bride, Amber.<eos> -Go, Stan.<eos> -Babe. Don't.<eos> -You're breaking my concentration--<eos> -And there's Dash. The baby of the family.<eos> He's Bunny's great-nephew. Harvard Business.<eos> How do you guys know Aunt Bunny?<eos> -We--<eos> -We didn't personally know her.<eos> -Our surrogate dad, Bobby Singer, did.
I'm glad I had you.<eos> That's not what I asked.<eos> Of course I want the baby.<eos> It's your child, so it's my child.<eos> You look so surprised.<eos> I guess I am.<eos> A little.<eos> My sister has to stop calling.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Luisa, he really doesn't...
- Yeah, that doesn't matter.<eos> He threatened Sara and David.<eos> Do you know where he lives?<eos> Off Germantown road.<eos> We're gonna leave officers here until we make sure that we've got him.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> I should go with you, 'cause it's very remote.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be out in a second.<eos> How you doing, David?
Is that a heartbeat?<eos> It is.<eos> We might not know where your sister is... But we know the most important thing.<eos> She's alive.<eos> - Who's alive?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Uh, this is Elsa.<eos> We're gonna find her sister.<eos> That's what this family does. We find people.<eos> We always do, because we really...
I have to go.<eos> I hope you're hungry.<eos> I think I over-ordered again. Mmm.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Simon. I think I'm ready for round two.<eos> Couldn't get in touch with my accountant. He's got all my files.<eos> Brought you everything I had at home.<eos> Hey. Did Grace ever get that job?<eos> She mentioned something about a presentation or something a while back.<eos> She did, didn't she?
- Oh, so sad.<eos> - Diving accident.<eos> - Oh, it was sad to hear.<eos> So they have lots of new evidence which...<eos> It appears that he is the culprit, or...?<eos> - You contrive well not on anything now?<eos> - Oh, no, no. No, no, no.<eos> I will not make any trouble.<eos> For you know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
I-I want you to know, I never intended to leave you, not like this, not on our wedding day, but I-it wasn't my choice.<eos> I wish I could tell you what's going on.<eos> I... wish I could explain.<eos> But just know that I love you.<eos> I've always loved you.<eos> Always.<eos> The ones to Alexis and my mother were pretty much the same.<eos> Kate, what did I do?<eos> Mm. I don't know.<eos> I don't.
And that's what makes you happy?<eos> Not totally, but...<eos> Then what do you need?<eos> See, I watched you work.<eos> When you had more to do than just fix corrupt software, you lit up.<eos> It's no fun just fixing problems all the time. Exactly.<eos> You want to create.<eos> You want to express yourself.<eos> You want to break out of who you are and try new things.<eos> Well, I do too.
- But he's already married.<eos> - And so she...<eos> Oh.<eos> - Well, I've read it before.<eos> So how is it different?<eos> He kills her.<eos> In the end.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I'm interested.<eos> How does he do it?
Oh.<eos> - Well, I've read it before.<eos> So how is it different?<eos> He kills her.<eos> In the end.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I'm interested.<eos> How does he do it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why does he do it?
Because he swore to me on his daughter's life.<eos> We had heard rumors Merlyn fathered another child.<eos> We couldn't confirm them.<eos> You know who it is.<eos> I do.<eos> If you put me through the effort of finding out on my own...<eos> I might have to exact a price from whoever it is you're protecting.<eos> My sister is Merlyn's daughter.<eos> And that is the reason he came back to Starling City.<eos> Because she did.
I want to just get this over with.<eos> - Jessica, what...<eos> - Am I doing here?<eos> I'm here to tell you that I know you know the truth about Louis' resignation.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Yes, you do, and I'm guessing you didn't like it.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't. Because I don't think that he deserves to be fired.<eos> That's funny, because I think you both deserve to be fired.<eos> - What do you...
No, Louis.<eos> To my knowledge, Harvey isn't planning to fire you.<eos> Thank you, Donna.<eos> I knew I could count on you.<eos> Can't remember the last time I saw you in here.<eos> I can't remember the last time this firm faced prosecution.<eos> I can:<eos> Ava Hessington.<eos> And after that, we said it would never come to this again.<eos> How the hell did it?
You tried to get Arthur on one thing.<eos> Instead, you got him on another, didn't you?<eos> - Don't answer him.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And that's exactly what you want to do with me, isn't it?<eos> That's enough.<eos> Stop typing.<eos> We're done here.<eos> - To answer your question...<eos> - Don't...
- I'm done.<eos> I'm done.<eos> And if I don't do something now, so are Harvey and Mike.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To finish what I started.<eos> - You know what I think?<eos> - What?<eos> I think we both could've used a better lawyer in that deposition.<eos> - You think this is funny?<eos> - No, I don't.
I am.<eos> Charles Forstman made me take a million dollars to keep from turning on him.<eos> What if he made Woodall take a taste too?<eos> You think we don't know that?<eos> That's the "bag of money" problem.<eos> It wouldn't be a bag of money, because if it's untraceable, he wouldn't have leverage over Woodall.<eos> That's great, but we can't get access to Woodall's bank accounts.<eos> We can't.<eos> But Cahill can.<eos> Okay, what good does that do us, huh?
Dude, relax.<eos> I know I already have one.<eos> Otherwise, I'd still be doing Chanel, not Chewy's.<eos> But I'm never gonna get back there unless you help me out.<eos> So just tell me what you need from me.<eos> Blood and urine.<eos> This one's for you.<eos> Evan, have a seat.<eos> Listen, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
Yes.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna get started.<eos> Will you be wanting pictures?<eos> - Yes.<eos> So, what are you studying? Teaching.<eos> Just one more semester.<eos> Nice.<eos> - I Googled you. - Oh? - Mm.<eos> - That couldn't have gone well.<eos> No, it didn't.
- Bellamy, you got to cut her loose!<eos> - No way! #Cut her loose!<eos> Acid fog.<eos> #Monroe, get back on the rope!<eos> Come on!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have to take cover from the fog.<eos> #Bellamy.<eos> No, we don't.
The grounders took you to Mount Weather?<eos> No.<eos> The mountain men.<eos> We have to get them out.<eos> We're not doing this right now.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Clarke.<eos> - Mom.<eos> Did anyone else make it here?<eos> Yes. 6 of you did.
I love you.<eos> I mean, this lighting, it's perfect for writing.<eos> Hey, that rhymes.<eos> Writing?<eos> Were you really gonna write now?<eos> Maybe...<eos> Oh, my gosh, stop...<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Hey, Carter family.<eos> How you doing today?
'Just show me what you're planning on wearing 'and we'll take things from there.'<eos> How about this?<eos> 'Doesn't work.<eos> 'It's boring blue and you're not boring blue.<eos> Not tonight.'<eos> Right.<eos> Which one of these is good?<eos> Like I said, white shirt with a black tie with a slim-cut grey jacket.<eos> Classic, timeless.<eos> I don't usually do jackets.
I made the mistake of saying no.<eos> When she asked me this time I gave her the right answer.<eos> I promise you, we're not the enemy.<eos> No, you're just sleeping with the enemy.<eos> I'm not gay, Emily.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> Look, until someone puts Ali away, we're doing what we have to do to survive.<eos> I'm sure you and your friends understand that.<eos> We think she killed Mona.<eos> We do, too.
Someone's gotta...<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Steven "Doc" Beck.<eos> I give you mercy.<eos> What the hell, Warren?<eos> You trying to kill me?<eos> You're alive?<eos> Damn straight I'm alive.<eos> We thought you were dead.<eos> Well so did I.
Goodbye.<eos> Come on, dear.<eos> - We're blown.<eos> - Why?<eos> No idea. I think Talbot's still pissed 'cause we kidnapped him that time.<eos> - We need to do this now.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Yo.<eos> - I could have handled him.<eos> - I did.
Sunshine has been found.<eos> The circle will not be broken.<eos> Enjoy. That's the last of the food.<eos> God, I'm so hungry my big guts are eating my little guts.<eos> You gonna eat all of that?<eos> Selfish little bastard.<eos> We need to split up and look for food and water.<eos> Oh, if we can find a two way radio or even like a satelite dish, I can trying contact that Citizen Z guy.<eos> That's good.<eos> Okay, you and Mack do that.
- It's you who needs the stable.<eos> Hey, Havva.<eos> Suppose you forgive me for the soup man's sake... So I get a good night's sleep?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - And even if she did, I don't.<eos> Here, watch this.<eos> Hey, Tayyar.<eos> Make an ugly face.<eos> Hey, don't! I told you.<eos> Don't do that.
What's going on?<eos> Tomorrow night we're asking for Zeliha's hand for me.<eos> - Who?<eos> That crazy girl?<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> She's so sweet. So feisty.<eos> I love her to bits.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> She doesn't seem that keen on you.<eos> Not to you she doesn't.
Sold his soul.<eos> You don't seem surprised at the idea of Old Scratch bartering for souls.<eos> There's one thing I never understood is why he even wants our souls.<eos> The Devil used to be an angel.<eos> That's why he's called the "First of the Fallen."<eos> You ask a holy type, and they'll tell you... the soul is the purest expression of God's love.<eos> The spark of creation.<eos> Every time the First takes a soul, he's exacting revenge, paying back the Almighty for casting him out.<eos> I do want to hear you.<eos> I do.
Not kill me? I don't know, Eddie.<eos> But you know more than you've been telling me.<eos> They're called meta-humans.<eos> "Meta-humans"?<eos> People with very powerful abilities.<eos> You and me are the only guys on the force that know what's really going on.<eos> And we need to keep it that way... So nobody else gets hurt.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> And The Flash?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I did it to stay alive.<eos> What would you have done?<eos> I know you guys made a fortune.<eos> Give me half the money.<eos> Otherwise, I'll perform your story every day in front of the Division office.<eos> Xiu, what fortune?<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> Sir Zhao.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Who doesn't in this town?
We're gonna go.<eos> We're gonna have a blast.<eos> Game Day burned down, men.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Town Lounge.<eos> Anybody?<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Later.<eos> All right.<eos> How you doing, Lieutenant?
The Secundum Naturae Ordinem Wesen are back, and Monroe is not happy.<eos> Diego?<eos> Did you fall?<eos> Diego?<eos> I didn't touch it.<eos> I didn't think you'd want me to.<eos> We're gonna need it as evidence.<eos> - When did you find it?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Rosalee did.
Everyone deserves a second chance, but few are willing to do what it takes to earn one.<eos> I completely understand.<eos> I think my skills could be of use to you.<eos> I know sacrifice, what it takes to move forward in life.<eos> I have no doubt that's true.<eos> The bodies of Massachusetts senator<eos> Christian Ward and both his mother and father were identified by police tonight in what appears to be a murder-suicide.<eos> A partially destroyed tape found in the fire is believed to be the senator's confession.<eos> I wanted him dead!<eos> I did!
- Visual learning.<eos> - Show us!<eos> Do it!<eos> - Visual learning!<eos> Okay, Coach, do you want to come up and help me?<eos> How about the new guy?<eos> British people love doing stuff, right?<eos> No, I don't think... - British guy... doing stuff!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> British guy doing stuff!
Do it!<eos> - Visual learning!<eos> Okay, Coach, do you want to come up and help me?<eos> How about the new guy?<eos> British people love doing stuff, right?<eos> No, I don't think... - British guy... doing stuff!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> British guy doing stuff!<eos> I'm telling you they don't like to do things.<eos> - Doing stuff!
Miss Sparrow's class!<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you were setting me up.<eos> But I want to stay with Mrs. Plank.<eos> But why? Miss -<eos> - Miss Sparrow's so fun and creative.<eos> Yeah, today, she gave us yarn, and we did whatever we wanted.<eos> I don't want to play with yarn.<eos> I want to read and learn math.<eos> We do math.
1956, to be exact...<eos> Oh, please, not again.<eos> When a little boy, just 10 years old, was promised by his parents... One a nurse, the other a doctor... that he'd be taken to the fifth game of the world series between the New York Yankees and...<eos> Oh, for the thousandth time, we were working the emergency room.<eos> - There was an emergency. - Mm.<eos> Couldn't just leave and take you to a baseball game.<eos> Don Larsen pitched a perfect game in game five.<eos> Do you know how often that happens in the world series?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Ever? Do you?
We have to assume that this weapon has the potential to do that.<eos> Because bad guys love their WMDs.<eos> Trick is, to activate the Obelisk, HYDRA has to take it to specific place.<eos> It's like they have the keys to launch a nuclear warhead ...<eos> Now they need the lock ...<eos> a temple inside the city.<eos> - Any idea where this temple is?<eos> - Glad you asked ...<eos> No. But it's in the city, and we now know where that is.<eos> Even better, HYDRA doesn't.
Yo. Jane's alibi checks out.<eos> Doorman places her at home during Eric's murder.<eos> What about the street cams in the area around Luca Tessaro's shooting?<eos> We looked.<eos> There's no cameras out that way.<eos> Ugh. Which means we're dead in the water.<eos> Which means I could be dead in the water.<eos> If one of the Tessaros killed Luca and Eric, we need to figure out who it was.<eos> Well, unless you got a bud in that family, too, they're not gonna talk.<eos> Luckily, a credit card just did the talking.
I want you to compel me to forget that I ever loved him.<eos> - Who is Damon Salvatore?<eos> - He's a monster.<eos> To get home, we'll harness the power of the eclipse using a mystical relic.<eos> No.<eos> Vampires murdered my wife.<eos> I'm gonna get him to name all his vampire buddies.<eos> Need any help?<eos> If even just a small, little part of you came back to check on me, then stay.<eos> Not doing so great, Damon.
All right? Don't do anything you'd be ashamed of.<eos> I'm not the one hiding my penis under an oboe.<eos> I needed to leave something to the imagination. - Go!<eos> - Shh!<eos> You're just embarrassing yourself now.<eos> I have to say good night to my hostess.<eos> Hailey, I know you can't believe anything I could say right now, so...<eos> Did you really wanna learn the oboe?<eos> Or was this all just about...<eos> No, I did.
I could've helped him.<eos> I would've been a good son.<eos> I would've helped him.<eos> He's beautiful.<eos> Absolutely perfect.<eos> You did it.<eos> He looks like Lance, doesn't he?<eos> I-I'm not imagining that, am I?<eos> No.<eos> No, he really does.
She freaked out but in the right way.<eos> I mean, she doesn't think I'm an alien.<eos> She didn't try to shoot me, at least on purpose.<eos> Good, last thing you need is another bucket of grief.<eos> You ever talk to the ex?<eos> Not a word.<eos> But it's not all on her.<eos> I mean, she didn't know what she was signing up for.<eos> Neither did you.<eos> Neither did any of us.
I'm so sorry to put you through all this.<eos> Don't be sorry.<eos> He's... lucky.<eos> You're both... very lucky.<eos> This man is a saint.<eos> A damn saint.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Say good-bye, Elliot.<eos> More like "Smelliot." Alan.<eos> ♪ Men. ♪ You doing okay?
That's what you said, right?<eos> Doesn't sound like stupid bar talk to me.<eos> I mean, it sounds like you knew exactly what you were saying.<eos> Okay, I was frustrated, I admit.<eos> You bust my chops at work.<eos> We both bring it home.<eos> It affects us in ways that aren't exactly healthy.<eos> You're the one who signed up for this...<eos> - working for your fiancé.<eos> - We both did.
Wow, it's like you were there.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> You said you had my back.<eos> Why do you keep doing this?<eos> He thinks I'm cool.<eos> I mean, when Jake was a kid, he thought Charlie was the cool one.<eos> When you moved in, Jake thought you were the cool one.<eos> Now it's my turn.<eos> Louis thinks I'm Al-Al Cool Dad.<eos> No, he doesn't.
And when the time is up I came back here and in the morning do it all again.<eos> I apologize, but I'm late.<eos> Your apology is accepted.<eos> Goodbye Mother.<eos> Injected.<eos> He is not usually like this.<eos> I'm surprised you're not more worried about him.<eos> Were he my responsibility... I would be.<eos> We had been told that Chief-Elder knew everything.<eos> Things no body else did.
Say, "I want to to tear Mai limb from limb."<eos> I...<eos> Yes, I want to tear her apart.<eos> I want to have fun doing it.<eos> Maul and tear her then she will be bloodstained and I want her to be more cute.<eos> Uh-huh, that's what I thought.<eos> I knew it from the first time I met you.<eos> You are a kind of pervert!<eos> But it's true, you want it?<eos> Yes, I do!
But far more precious.<eos> VOICE OF THE RING:<eos> Precious!<eos> Precious!<eos> There you are Thief in the Shadows.<eos> I did not come to steal from you O Smaug the Unassessably Wealthy.<eos> I merely wanted to gaze upon your magnificence.<eos> To see if you really were as great as the old tales say.<eos> I did not believe them.<eos> And do you now'?
She is too pretty to be your date.<eos> You got that right.<eos> This is Montana Moore, my very significant other... who was gracious enough to fly here to join us for dinner.<eos> Well, young lady, I hope you're prepared to withstand the heat... which this coming election will surely bring.<eos> Montana comes from a long line of flame-retardant women.<eos> All right.<eos> I got a great table, let's go.<eos> Flame retardant.<eos> He surprised me.<eos> How you doing, sir?
- With what?<eos> - This thing.<eos> - I do not think so.<eos> "It's all right, go on.<eos> - I was singing I heard a voice Who accompanied me.<eos> We danced...<eos> Well, it was more We bumped into each other. It was as if we were In a bubble.<eos> Sorry, I should spare you.<eos> Of the details. No, no, continue.<eos> On the contrary, this does well.
Go ahead.<eos> She tends to land on her feet.<eos> What you gonna do, Counsellor?<eos> Shoot me?<eos> That's right.<eos> Guess I cut out the wrong brother's heart.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> You boxed in law school.<eos> What the hell?<eos> As a matter of fact, I did.
No. Sorry.<eos> Can we have four of those and a tap water, please?<eos> What?<eos> (ANDY GULPING)<eos> I don't believe this, a man of your legendary prowess drinking fucking rain.<eos> It's like seeing a lion eating some hummus.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> I know it doesn't make any sense.<eos> You seriously have a problem with me not drinking, after what happened?<eos> I don't, but King Arthur does!
I don't mean like you and me.<eos> I mean, nothing will ever be like us.<eos> I just know there are things that I like to do that you don't... and things that you like to do that I don't.<eos> And I just think that we're in such a good place that we can allow each other...<eos> you know, to do that and still love each other and stay together.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, if that's what you want.<eos> I think it'd be good for us.<eos> I really do.
We know you had a rotten childhood, Mom. Who didn't?<eos> You don't know!<eos> You do not know!<eos> None of you know!<eos> None of you know, except this woman right here, and that man we buried today.<eos> Oh, sweet girl.<eos> Sweet Barbara my heart breaks for every time you felt pain.<eos> I wished I could've shielded you from it, but if you think you can fathom for one solitary second the pain that man endured in his natural life, you got another thing coming.<eos> You know where your father lived from age four till about ten?<eos> Do you?
Why?<eos> - Why, what's the matter?<eos> WILSON:<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm all run down.<eos> I need money...<eos> -...real bad.<eos> - What?<eos> My wife and I, we wanna go West.<eos> Oh, your wife does?
Aah!<eos> [WICKE SCREAMING]<eos> Put me down!<eos> Roderick!<eos> [GROWLING]<eos> [WHIMPERING]<eos> [PANTING]<eos> BIG FALLON:<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> Well, do you?
- "We."<eos> Baby, do we have enough, right?<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> - Mm-mm. - Not yet.<eos> - So what are we gonna do?<eos> Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go.<eos> Yeah, right?<eos> That...<eos> - Did I tell you, or what, right?<eos> - You did.
Just give me three minutes.<eos> I can go again. I'm really sorry.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, sweetie, no.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, this is silk!<eos> - Oyster?<eos> - Thank you. - Thanks.<eos> - How you doing?
What did she say?<eos> She has no rooms available next to each other.<eos> She's asking if we prefer "the dungeon", "the nurse's office..."<eos> Or the "mission to Mars."<eos> This'll do.<eos> Man on speakers'.<eos> Liftoff! We have a liftoff!<eos> Kind of homey, actually.<eos> Where do you plan on sleeping?<eos> I don't.
But either way, you're an asshole, Allan.<eos> Hit a three-pointer.<eos> Come in or whatever.<eos> I just jogged over here to feed the cat.<eos> If I don't shower right away my pores get all clogged and I get this, like, zit nest on my forehead.<eos> So why are you feeding the cat?<eos> So it doesn't starve to death. - But why can't Chantry feed it?<eos> - Because she flew to Dublin.<eos> She flew to Dublin?<eos> Yes, of course she did.
Research. When I was trying to find you.<eos> No one comes up here anymore.<eos> We have the place to ourselves.<eos> This is breathtaking.<eos> Sorry there's no cake. Well, I was expecting nothing, so this is great.<eos> Well, everyone should get something for their birthday.<eos> What did you get?<eos> Weapons mostly.<eos> I'm sure that doesn't surprise you.<eos> At this point, nothing really does.
Well, nobody's perfect.<eos> Lena, you have great powers.<eos> I can teach you how to use them. I can teach you how to become the most powerful dark caster who ever lived.<eos> Oh, that's so sweet of you, mama.<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> This mortal you think you love? You can never be together.<eos> I know.<eos> Did you ever love me, mama?<eos> You know, i don't remember.<eos> No mother does, really.
Oh, how we danced.<eos> For hours, it seemed.<eos> I can still feel his body pressed against mine.<eos> Sister, you were right about him.<eos> He is the great Wizard.<eos> He must be, to make me feel the way I feel.<eos> Not you, too, sister?<eos> He said we would rule Oz together.<eos> He said I would be his queen.<eos> Did he?
Height ain't nothing but a number.<eos> See, in Thailand, I'm in the 95th percentile.<eos> I'm okay over there.<eos> So, what you say can't hurt my feelings.<eos> Let's talk turkey.<eos> The guys that made this game saw your HBO special.<eos> They loved it.<eos> I loved it.<eos> Did I tell you?<eos> I really did.
Good job, Kid.<eos> It was great last night.<eos> All right.<eos> - Thanks, Frankie.<eos> - Stay loose.<eos> I like it.<eos> You're looking like new money in there. Ha, ha.<eos> All right.<eos> I thought you were his trainer, Dad.<eos> Yeah, buddy, so did I.
You are marrying Paolo.<eos> I'd even go to the ceremony myself... if weddings didn't make me break out all over in a terrible rash.<eos> I have something to tell you.<eos> I've been thinking lately... that it will be good... if I could care about someone the way you care about Paolo.<eos> I'd like someone who would just break my heart if I ever lost her.<eos> It's very hard to find.<eos> It's very hard.<eos> He lied to me, Frangois.<eos> Oui.<eos> People do that.
VVhoa, dude!<eos> - We'll see you in New York.<eos> It's dustin' time!<eos> You have to hand it to him.<eos> He never gives up.<eos> Come on, Chug, we have a jet to catch.<eos> New York City.<eos> Finish line, here we come!<eos> Hey. So are you ready to go, Skip?<eos> Probably best if I don't.
- No!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I can't-<eos> - Say it.<eos> Mom, get off of my back.<eos> No.<eos> You gotta do the "motherfucking."<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> - Do it.
That's enough.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You can take the cardboard.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Hold up.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> We are not done here.<eos> You need to show me what you got.<eos> Let's get down.<eos> Do what I do.
No, he needs to go talk to 'em, Pop.<eos> What are you lookin' at, asshole?<eos> Get the fuck out, get out!<eos> Right, come on guys!<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> You can't go with them?<eos> Nothin' I can do.<eos> Nothing you can do.<eos> Okay. I think that's bullshit.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
The Patan man is expected to marry a woman who will run an extended household. A woman who will live with the husband's family.<eos> Someone from within the clan.<eos> And what about you?<eos> What are your feelings?<eos> I want to save people's lives.<eos> Hasnat, I asked about your feelings.<eos> I love you.<eos> But do you want us to be together in spite of all our problems?<eos> - Do you want to make this work?<eos> - Yes, I do.
She said she doesn't want you. Get out.<eos> Okay, Jesus, stop.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> You think you can start singing and we're gonna forgive you?<eos> It doesn't work like that, okay?<eos> Wendy.<eos> - Fiona.<eos> - I don't know the words.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - Yes, you do.
You look beautiful, by the way.<eos> Don't look at me. All right?<eos> Don't look at my legs, don't look at my hair, don't smell my hair, don't ask me how I am, don't talk to me outside of these roles, 'cause we're done.<eos> Where you going? Just stand still.<eos> Get under the umbrella.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's just, Carmine wants Rosalyn to come.<eos> I don't care. You weren't listening.<eos> I don't care if Rosalyn comes.<eos> Just do your job, okay?
Cook a soup for mum.<eos> Give it to Tadzio...<eos> Give my things to Tadzio.<eos> I will go to Barabanov to ask for...<eos> Don't you dare, you can't!<eos> So what can I do?<eos> Everything will be all right.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Don't cry!<eos> I don't!
Julian says you can spend your life in cushy cubicles or you can march.<eos> You can breathe the tear gas and brave the truncheons or...<eos> Take a girl to dinner?<eos> Sorry, I didn't want to wake you up.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I've just never had a guy try to sneak out of his own apartment.<eos> The bank got a judge in California - to shut down our site.<eos> - What?<eos> I thought the Americans put free speech up there with mom and apple pie.<eos> So did we.
I'm not selling your mother's house, and I am not having this discussion with you.<eos> Yes, you are, because half of that house is ours, and we get a say in this too.<eos> Fine. I'll buy you out.<eos> Jesus, Dad, you really think this is about the fucking money?<eos> You really think this is what Mom would want?<eos> Think she'd want you to die here, alone, lonely and miserable?<eos> I am not lonely, and I am not miserable.<eos> And if you'll excuse me, there is someplace I have to be.<eos> Dad, we have to talk about this.<eos> No, we don't.
The way they stare at your tits and pretend not to.<eos> Actually, I was hoping I wasn't like that.<eos> You're different.<eos> That's why I love being with you.<eos> You stare at me for no reason.<eos> Should I call the police, monsieur?<eos> I'm sure that's not necessary.<eos> I'm gonna wait for him.<eos> You want to go in?<eos> Do you?
What's in Ozona?<eos> Ozona is nowhere near Honey Island Swamp.<eos> We need to get to Ozona is what we need to do.<eos> And for the last time, it's Miss Perlman,<eos> Elliot, okay?<eos> Just, you know, call me Amanda.<eos> Do that. Amanda.<eos> I thought you were Sheriff Fowler's wife.<eos> I need to call Sheriff and let him know what we're doing.<eos> No, you absolutely do not.
He's dead.<eos> Elliot, no!<eos> Give him the ashes!<eos> I knew you were real.<eos> I came to save you.<eos> Here's daddy, you motherfucker!<eos> Got to get up.<eos> Get up.<eos> Get up.<eos> Fuckin' do it already!
Get up.<eos> Get up.<eos> Fuckin' do it already!<eos> Just one more time.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, do it. Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Come on, fuckin' do it already!<eos> Come on, get up!<eos> Oh, goddammit, do it already.
If the Hive goes down, this whole city goes dark.<eos> Question here.<eos> Why do they call it the Hive?<eos> Listen.<eos> Hear all those little worker bees?<eos> Hey, what about Max?<eos> You know he wants to bone you, right?<eos> Oh, my God, Autumn.<eos> Stop it, that's disgusting.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Why?<eos> What for?<eos> If you ever need your own space, or you just want to get away from Larry or Steve, it's there for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, funny enough, Larry's the reason I go home.<eos> I don't want to leave him alone with my mother.<eos> Steve just doesn't understand that.<eos> I understand.<eos> You want to protect your mother.<eos> Every daughter does.
What is the link?<eos> Sum, think about it.<eos> There is some fucking link.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop what?<eos> Can't you see? See what?<eos> We are assassins.<eos> I know we're all assassins, Sum, but what does that have to do with anything?<eos> We do all people's dirt. Yeah, well you know, I know.<eos> We do people's dirt.
- Shut up and we'll talk.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Listen.<eos> Look at him.<eos> The Terminator.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> He came from the future to fuck us all up the ass.<eos> Marc Delgado.<eos> I'm sure you know why I'm here.<eos> Yes, we all do.
We used to have a place like this before we were... we were married.<eos> Before the children, me and my husband.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> He isn't anymore, is he?<eos> It's all so new and confusing.<eos> He wanted to give us everything, but, uh... Of course we couldn't accept that.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> - You need the car key.<eos> - No, I don't need the car.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
Well, those weren't my words.<eos> I wanted to get acquainted.<eos> I'm not bothered, you know.<eos> I've got nothing to hide.<eos> What does your father do, now that we're at it?<eos> He's with a TV production company:<eos> - Q-Entertainment.<eos> - So he's a big shot?<eos> - So he also fires people?<eos> - He hardly ever does.
A kiss, perhaps?<eos> No, I'm not going to sleep.<eos> What you did for Isaac, was really great.<eos> Least I could do.<eos> I'm on your sofa. Look what I eat.<eos> Properly.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> - Good night, Candace.<eos> You know, Peter thinks you're a hero, Dalton.<eos> That does everyone here.
- But I can call.<eos> - What?<eos> And say who did it?<eos> You drive me insane with your tics.<eos> Makes me puke!<eos> - You're not so great yourself.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> - Yes. - So tell me!<eos> - You fart in your sleep.<eos> - I never do.
I can't get away from here.<eos> We have too much to do.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Wow, are you making a salad?<eos> We're not eating this.<eos> It's for our photo shoot. "Skin Meets Vegetables".<eos> Art.<eos> I love art.<eos> Do you know the art section at Ikea?<eos> Do you?
N-woo!<eos> Here, you take it, you take it.<eos> N-woo.<eos> - It's saying that I'm N-woo.<eos> - N-woo.<eos> N-woo.<eos> N-woo.<eos> - N-woo.<eos> - Look, Flint, they came here to help.<eos> We all did.
I think we go somewhere that not so far away that we still a part of those who still here.<eos> Come on. Grab something you can believe in.<eos> You'll be okay.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Abra cadabra, Grandpa.<eos> Oh, did you ever find out who ratted you out at the McDowell's party?<eos> Who else?<eos> Deputy dickhead Carl. - Yeah.<eos> But you know the new girl, Julie?<eos> Yeah, who doesn't?
Try to think carefully, madame.<eos> Perhaps you met him through your late husband and his work?<eos> Stephen rarely thought to include me in his work, monsieur.<eos> I'm sorry I can't be any more help to you.<eos> We do not wish to distress you, madame.<eos> I loved my husband, monsieur.<eos> But I realised some time ago that my affection was no longer reciprocated.<eos> Last night I learned for certain what I had suspected for some time, that he... that he...<eos> That he and Madame Olivier were conducting the love affair?<eos> How did you...?
Ah, you're a doll.<eos> She is. She's a doll.<eos> Anyways, I asked them, I said, "Girls, what's so funny?"<eos> And Diane said to me,<eos> "Why, Daddy, Mary Poppins."<eos> I didn't even know what a Mary Poppins was.<eos> But then she gave me one of your books, and, oh, by gosh, my imagination caught on fire.<eos> Absolutely on fire.<eos> And those embers have burned ever since, as you know.<eos> I do. Yes.
Because my guys are gonna do things with it that are revolutionary, Pam. Revolutionary! Your Mary Poppins is gonna literally fly off the pages of your books.<eos> This magical woman who has only lived inside your head, well, you are gonna be able to meet her, speak to her.<eos> Now, the singing, I'm very glad you've come to that.<eos> Milk in first, please.<eos> Then the tea.<eos> And a spoonful of sugar.<eos> You don't intend for this film to be a musical?<eos> I absolutely do.<eos> Mr. Disney, Mary Poppins does not sing.<eos> Yes, she does.
Well, then, he'll take to me with the business end of his beautiful hatchet!<eos> There!<eos> Whack! "Take that for not dropping your bairns on schedule!"<eos> Whack! "Go on, then! Take that! Take that!"<eos> - Mr. Belhatchett...<eos> - I want you gone.<eos> Ginty.<eos> Sweet thing, what are you doing here?<eos> You said today was ice cream day.<eos> Ice cream day. Yes, I did.
Whatever you're going to do, you do it now and call me.<eos> Kathy!<eos> Both of you, out.<eos> Now.<eos> Nurse.<eos> She died in anguish, you know.<eos> My mother.<eos> She knew that after she was gone, all that was left for me was this.<eos> She never understood.<eos> But you do.
_<eos> _<eos> King Robert wanted her dead.<eos> Of course he wanted her dead.<eos> She's a Targaryen.<eos> The last Targaryen.<eos> I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.<eos> - I didn't sit on the small council.<eos> - No?<eos> Doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally--
- sentence you to die. - I understand.<eos> But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it.<eos> - You're gonna need me.<eos> - Take him away.<eos> Why am I gonna need you?<eos> My king.<eos> It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.<eos> Their Lord Commander is dead.<eos> Took a ranging party north and never made it back.<eos> One lad did, though.
But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> More shit.<eos> I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.<eos> The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.<eos> - How'd that turn out for us?<eos> - He had no way of knowing.<eos> We do now.
About a week, I think.<eos> You think?<eos> You don't know?<eos> When we went to Castle Black, we took the King's Road.<eos> You and your roads.<eos> Is that how you lot do your fighting?<eos> You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?<eos> Most of the time, yes.<eos> How do the men holding the banners fight?<eos> They don't, really.
I know what you're going to say, but please don't.<eos> Come on! Come on! None of this mooning about.<eos> Plenty to see in here.<eos> Plenty to see.<eos> One thing in particular.<eos> What would Constable make of this lot, eh?<eos> I cannot believe that I've dreaded rejection from this bunch of pansies.<eos> - I rather like this one.<eos> It has something.<eos> You do, do you?
They confirmed it.<eos> My parents had been right and someone was trying to steal what they died for.<eos> -So you confronted Dick.<eos> -He led the divers there!<eos> He knew what Ante and I had experienced.<eos> He was going to put the find in some museum for others to look at.<eos> But he had betrayed the wrong person!<eos> The wrong person!<eos> -The police know I'm here.<eos> -No, they don't.
Why don't you open it, you lazy...<eos> Somebody help!<eos> Close your mouth!<eos> No way.<eos> Can I ride him?<eos> A deer!<eos> Okay.<eos> Daddy, I left the front door open in case any animals wanted to come in.<eos> - You did, huh?<eos> - And one did.
They're supposed to be so modest.<eos> Let me tell you, when they get it in their heads how they want to fuck they're like a freight train.<eos> Sign here.<eos> The things I've learned about women.<eos> Fuck.<eos> About half of it I would like to forget.<eos> I'm not sure if I follow you.<eos> What is it you would like to forget, for instance?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Sure I do.
Yeah. You're nice.<eos> You are.<eos> That's what I like about you.<eos> That's what everyone likes about you.<eos> I wouldn't want you to change that.<eos> But there's a time to be nice.<eos> And then there's also a time when you have to say, "Enough is enough."<eos> And stick your foot so far up a prick like Phil's ass that he chokes on your fucking shoelaces.<eos> And I think now is one of those times.<eos> I do, too.
Did you get the Twinkies?<eos> Henry, a healthy diet is crucial at Magdalena's age!<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - In her room.<eos> And that's where she'll sleep.<eos> Sleeping in her dad's bed impedes her development.<eos> If she wants to, she can sleep there.<eos> That's the way it stays.<eos> You're restricting her independence.<eos> - In Sweden, every kid does it.
Here's to fire in our hearts.<eos> Drink up, boys.<eos> I love the impurities. Ooh.<eos> Nice.<eos> Mother, may I?<eos> Yes, I may.<eos> So, it was you painted these,<eos> The lines? Oh, not me.<eos> Alvin did most of them. I just started working for him.<eos> How many'd you do?
I've gotta go.<eos> You go.<eos> I'll do what I can here.<eos> And ask my granddaughter to come and visit me one day, will you?<eos> She looks more and more like Emily.<eos> My daughter would have been very proud of you today, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> It's a long shot, but Emily would have tried.<eos> "Get out of the lab, Felix"!<eos> "Do some field work"!
I mean, real pussy's all good, but, no offense...<eos> No, no, no offense taken.<eos> So you like porn better than sex?<eos> Well, what is it?<eos> What do you get from porn that you don't get from sex with an actual person? - I lose myself.<eos> - You lose yourself.<eos> Yeah, just... goodbye.<eos> - And that doesn't happen when you have sex.<eos> - I wish it did.<eos> Sure, don't we all?
- Playing fucking hide and seek.<eos> Barb, put him down.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Look, I know that this sounds nuts, but that doll,<eos> - I think that there's something in it.<eos> - Wait a second.<eos> You know about this?<eos> - Well, I think that I do.<eos> - You know what's in this?<eos> Do you?
Unbelievable.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> How many dads of how many undergrads were you working on at the time?<eos> I wanna ask this question.<eos> I've never asked it because I wanted to maintain some sort of dignity.<eos> A sense of dignity or a sense of self-esteem, but tell me, how many got notes?<eos> Just wanna know. Just curious.<eos> -You don't want to know that. Not really.<eos> - No, I do.
Hello, sweetheart.<eos> Hello, Hank.<eos> Mrs. Fetch.<eos> Or perhaps I should say Mrs. Fetching.<eos> I've been wanting to have a word with you.<eos> Regarding?<eos> An extramarital affair.<eos> - Oh, my.<eos> - Mm. I know my husband fucks around on the road.<eos> - You do?
Anyway...<eos> Anyway, is that what you were going to say to me?<eos> No. I was going to suggest you work harder.<eos> That you buckle down and get to work.<eos> You can't change the world while laying in a nap pod. But honestly if any of what you just said applies even slightly to yourself you might think about doing something about it.<eos> That's coming from someone who wakes up in the morning, and first thing on their calendar is regret.<eos> And that's not a good feeling.<eos> Anyway, I should go.<eos> Thank you!<eos> - But before I do...
Ride it. Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> Get it! Get it! Get it!<eos> Oh, I've had it. Oh, yeah! Dip it!<eos> Why don't I finish up...<eos> I can't watch anymore.<eos> I just can't watch anymore.<eos> Uh-uh, you ain't done yet.<eos> I had no idea you was a squirter.<eos> Neither did I?
I can't see you any more.<eos> You're married.<eos> I can't see you any more.<eos> - Dinner and a show, was it?<eos> - As it happens.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Nice.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> We do, yeah.
All right, mate?<eos> That's the way I roll.<eos> You know that, she should know that.<eos> What about that she's, um... - Kind... - Boring.<eos> ...and warm.<eos> Warm? Put the radiator on if you want warm.<eos> And, um, good with kids.<eos> So was Michael Jackson. Look at that marriage. It didn't last.<eos> Yeah, but I love her.<eos> - Love. - Well, I do.
See, all you lot live idle and wasted lives.<eos> Listen to him!<eos> We have built a new boat.<eos> A boat?<eos> And with this boat, for the first time, we can go west.<eos> Across the great sea to a place called England, where countless riches await us.<eos> How would we steer across the open sea?<eos> We have discovered a way.<eos> You want us to join you in the boat?<eos> Yes, we do.
You've been gunning for my job since the day you bounced in here with a lollipop in your mouth.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'll send you a bottle of champagne from the Middle West, wherever the fuck that is.<eos> I'm gonna turn it down.<eos> You don't have to leave.<eos> Are you trying to rub this in or something?<eos> Please believe me.<eos> You should be in the White House.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I never did.
Can you tell me what you think about the future... of us as a couple. If it's worth it.<eos> Worth what'?<eos> To marry.<eos> Tell me.<eos> - I'm not clairvoyant.<eos> - You know psychology.<eos> For 1806 Euro per session you could do something useful.<eos> Ask her questions.<eos> Common.<eos> Do your job.
I'm just calling to say the band were fucking amazing the other night.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> No, not really.<eos> I've been kicked out my flat.<eos> And I got nowhere else to go.<eos> Do you know where Horsey is now?<eos> No, I don't.
And?<eos> !<eos> Patience, Reid.<eos> It's just a matter of minutes.<eos> So, is this her?<eos> This the woman I am supposed to have slaughtered?<eos> What if she is?<eos> If I could see a way of clearing myself of this, would you grant it to me?<eos> Not if it involve you leaving this room, Captain.<eos> It does not.
Thanks for the food.<eos> Look, um, you wanna talk about it?<eos> Drinking alone?<eos> - To keeping secrets.<eos> - # Downing my whiskey #<eos> - Hey, um...<eos> - Rebecca.<eos> Rebecca.<eos> I think you should go home.<eos> No, you don't.
It's a common affliction, Duncan.<eos> A lot of men have it.<eos> Not me, of course. I'm a very virile man.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> Super virile.<eos> - Very virile.<eos> I don't know you well enough for this to feel comfortable with me.<eos> Bobby, thank you so much for this delicious food.<eos> If you want, I can set up an examination.<eos> - I don't.
Sarah?<eos> And Sarah's there?<eos> She's right over there.<eos> On the grass.<eos> And what does Sarah want?<eos> I know what she wants.<eos> She wants a family.<eos> And I just don't know if I if I'll ever be a good...<eos> I know, I know, I know it will make you happy.<eos> But I don't...
Before you leave make me one more of those soy white Russians.<eos> I'm sorry, Siegel.<eos> What were you saying?<eos> You're not gonna believe this, but Sotto, he's back in.<eos> To what? Amazon Games?<eos> Your girlfriend's not the only one to beat out now.<eos> The legend himself?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I thought you guys were pals?<eos> Yeah, so did I.
Hope you're well.<eos> I'm sure they're gonna be a big hit at the auction.<eos> Hope you're well.<eos> Right this way, Mr. Hammerschmidt.<eos> He's here.<eos> Good afternoon, Tom.<eos> Legal?<eos> Did you say it or didn't you?<eos> To you and to anyone who asks...<eos> Yes, I did.
Am I not doing it right?<eos> Well, it's just not you.<eos> I am 42.<eos> So?<eos> Something has to be me by now.<eos> I think you should tell Kate.<eos> She was just here.<eos> So...<eos> If she wanted to know, it's all right here.<eos> She doesn't.
The balls on that son of a--<eos> I got all these little pieces.<eos> They're all part of the story, right?<eos> But they don't mean much on their own.<eos> But when you start telling me what you know, when you start filling in the gaps, I'll have him in lockup before the sun goes down.<eos> Hank, I- - I...<eos> I think maybe...<eos> Maybe I need a lawyer.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, no, you don't. I-
I will.<eos> Give me my baby.<eos> Marie, put her down.<eos> I am not leaving here without her.<eos> Marie.<eos> Give me my baby.<eos> Skyler, we are not leaving without her.<eos> Give me my baby right now!<eos> Marie!<eos> Do it now.
Thanks. I guess.<eos> We have a situation -- a bad situation.<eos> You mean with the spy.<eos> You know about it?<eos> There isn't a soul in Charleston that doesn't.<eos> And, frankly, people are pretty upset about it.<eos> Well, I've been tasked with the job of investigating the mole, and, frankly, I could use someone with experience.<eos> I'm not sure if busting a couple of small-time drug dealers qualifies me for espionage work, Dr. Manchester.<eos> Besides...how do you know I'm not the spy?<eos> Well, I don't, actually.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?<eos> No.<eos> You've got this wrong, Marty.<eos> There is no "you" and "I" in education.<eos> Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters,<eos> "U" and "I" are in the word education.<eos> But education with a capital "E"...<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> I don't think I do.<eos> Yes, you do, Marty.
Now, those numbers dip a little when you introduce cocaine, but not by much.<eos> Randy?<eos> It's a risk, but it'll make waves.<eos> Free coverage across the board.<eos> The narrative has to be redemption, a phoenix from the ashes.<eos> Well, let's not focus on the ashes.<eos> We don't want people to think Peter was a disaster.<eos> No, no.<eos> We focus on the positive.<eos> A "fresh start" and a "clean start" both did well in focus groups.
I'm might-- I might even suck it right off.<eos> You don't know.<eos> I do not know.<eos> It's gonna be good.<eos> - I'm gonna make some hot loving to your-- to your dad bod.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I wanted to bid on the Cuperbergs' condo in Maui and now I can't.<eos> Jeff, you don't wanna stay at that condo.<eos> It sounds repulsing.<eos> Yeah I do.
Because they tweet.<eos> Yeah they do.<eos> Just my nom de coffee, if you will.<eos> Oh.<eos> I'm Rachel.<eos> I'm McKenna. It's nice to meet you.<eos> - When I got out of college, I, uh-- I majored in journalism, but I kinda couldn't get my shit together, so I ended up working at this PR firm writing press releases about Calista Flockhart's buttery choc highlights.<eos> Guys, who wants to try the new bar method place with me?<eos> Oh, is that open?<eos> Yeah, me I do.
I held the belt for 18 months. I used to hang it right up there.<eos> You know?<eos> A good conversation piece.<eos> But with this tough economy, I had to pawn it a little while back to pay for the leaking taps.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Different places.<eos> Where'd you sit?<eos> Roscoe.<eos> I did eight years at Allenwood.
Pop.<eos> Can you meet me for a drink?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> If everything was all right, I wouldn't be asking you to meet me for a drink on short notice.<eos> Can't you tell me on the phone?<eos> James, just put on your big-boy pants and meet your father at a bar of your choice so we can mumble, like men, over a beer.<eos> No.<eos> This is where they lock up the pain pills.<eos> - We need a bolt cutter.<eos> - No, we don't.
Just when I was getting used to the sound of crickets.<eos> It's a fucking nightmare.<eos> It is that.<eos> I see that girl and I can't help but think it could've been one of mine.<eos> Well, it could've been any of ours.<eos> I'll put you two together. That's all.<eos> Look, I don't know what it is with you and Dr. Pryce, but he is the closest available scientific authority.<eos> You really gonna make me ask Olivia...<eos> - You know what he did.<eos> - No, I don't. None of us do.
So you're saying he wanted her to sleep through the night?<eos> But it still doesn't mean that he snuck out to meet Alison.<eos> Maybe he met up with Meredith.<eos> Were they still together then?<eos> No, they weren't seeing each other.<eos> That's what he told me.<eos> In the journal entry, he said he promised to meet Alison when she came back from her grandmother's.<eos> At was the same night she died.<eos> Maybe he agreed to meet her at a different time.<eos> No, he didn't.
But I just need to be able to see him sometimes.<eos> - You see him.<eos> - On Skype.<eos> I need to be able to touch him.<eos> He is my son.<eos> I can't, okay? I can't.<eos> Not alone.<eos> - Julia, you tried to hurt him.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.
Why are you meeting a client so late?<eos> He's coming in on a late flight and wants to grab a drink.<eos> You know, that's what business is all about, honey.<eos> Anyone can make travel arrangements, but you keep the executives happy, you keep the accounts.<eos> How have you been, Martha?<eos> Fine, Clark.<eos> Would you like to come in?<eos> So, referencing our meeting this evening... obviously, you understand it's been classified Top Secret by the the Internal Affairs Division of the Committee to oversee United States' counterintelligence agencies.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, - et cetera, et cetera?<eos> - I do.
Angry?<eos> But I-I don't want to get him in trouble. No, no, no, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Our counterintelligence units, they safeguard the security of our nation, Martha.<eos> So, we have to safeguard their security.<eos> Tell me what you want next. Oh.<eos> I don't know.<eos> How about... this?<eos> Oh, I... oh, I don't know.<eos> I don't... oh!
Steve.<eos> Arthur. What the hell are you doing here so early?<eos> I could ask you the same question.<eos> This is good. Steve, why don't you join us this time?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> This time?<eos> Steve, have a seat.<eos> John?<eos> Arthur, I don't want to.<eos> Yes. You do.
- How gross!<eos> - It's not as bad as you think.<eos> Actually, my wife and I are the only couple in Italy who are in love.<eos> Orietta, watch out for Lello.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> He's the world's greatest salesman, he cons everyone.<eos> In no time he'll get you to spend every penny on whatever he's selling.<eos> You always flatter me.<eos> Just because I express myself well doesn't mean I'm always working!<eos> - What do you do?
This is a good one to bet on.<eos> His name is Ojo Rojo.<eos> Mister Herrera.<eos> Paid in total.<eos> With dollars, as you wanted<eos> What was once paid in full is now only half.<eos> Next time bring 500.<eos> Here we go.<eos> You might find this hard to believe because of how welcoming my country can be, but some of my colleagues in the legislature believe your kind is ruining Costa Rica.<eos> Me doing damage?
I see the Ripper, but I don't feel the Ripper.<eos> - Franklyn, the lion is not in the room.<eos> - He's, um, he's eating them.<eos> The real Chesapeake Ripper is gonna make sure everybody knows it.<eos> I don't think we've ever been alone in a room together, have we?<eos> My name is Mariam Lass.<eos> I'm actually just a trainee. She was a very brave young woman.<eos> Jack, it's Miriam. I don't want to die like this.<eos> The Chesapeake Ripper kills in sounders of three.<eos> He did his first victims in nine days.
I'm okay, I'm okay!<eos> Who?<eos> - Let me get past!<eos> - Julián!<eos> Jesus fucking Christ! Let me past, Pedro!<eos> Pedro, please let me get by.<eos> - Don't do it.<eos> - Julián, please... Alyssa, please.<eos> Let me get by.<eos> No, don't. No.
Anyway, Miss Delsanto said words are lies.<eos> Yeah, they're traps, she says.<eos> Lies?<eos> Traps?<eos> She said that?<eos> What about truth, power?<eos> I think a pictures is a lot more powerful than a word.<eos> Really?<eos> How many think that?<eos> Don't you?
I wanted to check it out, you know?<eos> Peek inside.<eos> - I put my head in. - You stuck your head in it?<eos> Well, you know, just... gathering material.<eos> - Chrissie, go do it!<eos> - Go into it!<eos> - Go for it, Chrissie!<eos> Go, keep going. - Keep going!<eos> - Go on, Chrissie,<eos> - do it!
Peek inside.<eos> - I put my head in. - You stuck your head in it?<eos> Well, you know, just... gathering material.<eos> - Chrissie, go do it!<eos> - Go into it!<eos> - Go for it, Chrissie!<eos> Go, keep going. - Keep going!<eos> - Go on, Chrissie,<eos> - do it!<eos> Do it!
What is this?<eos> Today it's Madame who must wait.<eos> Madame, I'm very sorry, but I have to have a few words with Fido first.<eos> Your behavior is really upsetting me today.<eos> I really ought to send you home.<eos> Happy Christmas, Fido.<eos> I want your cock.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> I want your cock.<eos> No, you don't.
You do?<eos> He said you got put up at the big jail one time.<eos> Coleman told you that? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I have. I...<eos> I did 29 months in the penitentiary for assault on a police officer.<eos> They pulled me over behind a shopping center uptown.<eos> This one officer, pretty-boy type guy, had some issue with me.<eos> Thought I had something to do with one of the girls he knew. And I didn't know what the hell he was talking about.<eos> Then they tried to shoot me, after I beat the shit out of all three of them.<eos> Or one did.
That's the hardest fucking work I ever done in my life.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> - Are you paying my boy?<eos> - Hell, yeah!<eos> I ain't seen he got paid none.<eos> Well, he probably saves it 'cause he's smart.<eos> Buying this GMC off of me.<eos> Doing what?
We got another performer, folks!<eos> You didn't fucking qualify, bitch!<eos> Get down. Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you, the one and hopefully only, "Jeff Brown eats his own boogers and I should know<eos> You got anything to say up top?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My real name is Kara Jenkins. And uh, this is my interpretation of what's it like to have sex with a penis the size of a toothpick.<eos> This is gonna be exciting, folks.<eos> Hit it!<eos> So then, you've, so you've performed...<eos> Well, in a living room, I did, yeah.
You never know for sure.<eos> Even if you're not famous, you can not be sure.<eos> Tja, da hast du recht.<eos> You know, I would never want to be famous.<eos> I would like to know the X Factor, but then only on Saturday night 11 to 1<eos> And then everything will be normal again.<eos> With you it's never normal, right?<eos> But maybe you do not want that, otherwise you would not do on Ibiza holiday.<eos> Then you would be flown safely to a desert island.<eos> That did not Elza.
I mean, she's not going back.<eos> 'Cause I've built a cage.<eos> What a good idea!<eos> I've missed you.<eos> I missed you, too.<eos> I should tell you...<eos> I bought some night tables.<eos> You did?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Take that, mommy!<eos> Please get the fuck off me. Please?<eos> You're getting soft.<eos> I can feel you getting soft already.<eos> Faggot!<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> Oh, no, don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody about this.<eos> Good.<eos> God, I want drugs!<eos> Yeah, well, who doesn't?
Such a troublesome guy.<eos> That sword thirsts for human blood.<eos> Kageura san.<eos> What time do you think it is now?<eos> Miyabe Kyuuzou... no...<eos> Please tell me about the story of my grandfather.<eos> It seems as if you have matured a little.<eos> You said that your own grandfather is a coward right?<eos> I thought I have nothing to say to a guy like that.<eos> Did you do more research after that?
He's this teacher at the school.<eos> He will be a teacher.<eos> He has his exams soon and he's been giving me private lessons.<eos> - Private lessons?<eos> - Math lessons, Mom.<eos> Fine.<eos> You have condoms, at least?<eos> - Mom!<eos> - What?<eos> We do the lessons at school, in study hall.
Yeah, if you want.<eos> She might not want to come back with him.<eos> Why did she cry at the restaurant?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> I called Shahryar.<eos> He said she burst into tears.<eos> She's never this late.<eos> What did you tell her?<eos> You hadn't told her you were pregnant?<eos> You did?
Come on, get up.<eos> Where's your jacket?<eos> I won't go.<eos> I don't want to go back tonight.<eos> I'll call her and you talk to her.<eos> Marie-Anne?<eos> Hold on, please.<eos> I'm staying here tonight.<eos> Why did you hang up?<eos> She did.
Oh, come on. I got a kid here.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm very, very sorry.<eos> Wait a minute, this is a bar.<eos> No, absolutely not.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Why do I not know who Simon Larkin is?<eos> That would probably be because the FBI knows more than you do.<eos> Anything happening in my neighborhood I have a right to know.<eos> No, you actually don't.
The front lamps blink.<eos> That's just the coil earthing the circuit.<eos> Look!<eos> Get your guns out for the revolution! Bunch of limp dicks!<eos> Peace! And love.<eos> H"s like: "The Monkey King".<eos> What?<eos> "King Kong". The film where the big ape rapes the young journalist.<eos> He doesn't rape her.<eos> Yes he does.
Yeah.<eos> Check you later, though.<eos> Can't wait to get inside that oval office.<eos> Stay free.<eos> But wait! I didn't even get to show you my Apple product placement!<eos> Is this thing on?<eos> - Hello, America!<eos> - Hello, America!<eos> All right, we came here expecting to find a bunch of ghosts, and guess what?<eos> We did.
Dump him at once, he's dangerous.<eos> You saw his eyes?<eos> He was ready to kill me.<eos> It was hilarious!<eos> Listen, he's made your home his territory.<eos> I said he's a wild animal.<eos> He's a killer. Get rid of him!<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> Maud, I'm not kidding.<eos> Do it at once!
And we're supposed to believe she didn't realize what Alex was like when she was with him.<eos> Please!<eos> Have you seen his arms?<eos> If a woman doesn't see that, it's because she doesn't want to.<eos> You fucking bitch!<eos> Slut! You did it on purpose, you bitch!<eos> Sorry, didn't mean to.<eos> Bitch!<eos> Hurry up, this stinks.<eos> It sure does.
You sure are pretty, Miss.<eos> Strange thing to say with him gone!<eos> It's Sarah, our lovely Sarah.<eos> - What the fuck is this?<eos> - Oh, come on! Your brother's girlfriend!<eos> Silly me.<eos> Francis smokes these on special occasions.<eos> But he'll share, won't he?<eos> And you can smoke inside.<eos> My husband did from '71 to 2001, so the smell...
You moved some of mine, didn't you?<eos> You did, you cheat!<eos> I'm gonna win anyway.<eos> Uffe?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Did you see something out there?<eos> Come on.<eos> Back to bed.<eos> We're not allowed to do this, are we?<eos> - To do what?
I don't know.<eos> It just sort of came to you, didn't it?<eos> No, you rejected a lot of things.<eos> And we can't shoot one of the things I rejected?<eos> We just don't have the time.<eos> Look, my job is to introduce your headphones to a huge, drunk, male audience.<eos> And it's not about my work, it's about making a great ad.<eos> The association not being with Vietnam, but with a laugh, a smile, that all comes from your headphones.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> But I do.
Is he no longer with us?<eos> When he was around 40, he developed pancreatic cancer.<eos> By the time they found it, the tumor had metastasized to the liver.<eos> They gave him chemo, but... it was just a waiting game.<eos> The kids both offered to look after him, but he wouldn't hear of it.<eos> In those last months, he seemed more peaceful than I'd ever seen him.<eos> And then the strangest thing happened.<eos> He disappeared.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> No one did.
The Lickey Tea Rooms. Friday.<eos> Ten o'clock. And when I say the boss, I mean Thomas.<eos> Come on.<eos> The scum of the Earth...<eos> Now what the bloody hell's been going on here?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> The coppers told everyone Arthur had agreed to it when he was arrested.<eos> They said the Peaky Blinders had cleared out to the fair to let them do it.<eos> I never said nothing to that copper about smashing up bloody houses...<eos> All right... which pubs did they do?
I know about teenage girls. I raised one.<eos> My God, Jessie, you talked about killing yourself once a week.<eos> I talked about it, but I never tried it.<eos> And I'm saying she didn't really mean to, either.<eos> It was a-a cry for attention.<eos> If she really meant to kill herself, she'd be dead.<eos> I hereby call this meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee to order.<eos> Mr. Berenson, in accordance with the practice of the committee, would you stand and be sworn?<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Bring it in.<eos> Have a stretch.<eos> All right, on the ground.<eos> Oh, I'm so wet.<eos> Not in a good way, either.<eos> Mr. B's a hottie, though.<eos> Fuck, I know.<eos> Right? Too bad he wants to get it in with April!<eos> I know.<eos> No, he doesn't.
- Appointment in Newark.<eos> - Do we have to, Dickie?<eos> I'm tired of traipsing.<eos> A nice hotel...<eos> Mr. White makes me happy, I make you happy.<eos> Two weeks at a grand per, then we talk about what comes after.<eos> You carpetbagging me. I'm treating you square.<eos> I always do.<eos> I want Fletcher Henderson up there.<eos> Who doesn't?
But Köhler was not alone.<eos> He had occupied helpers, accomplices, that is.<eos> Maybe you're Yes really at it, as a right great thing to reveal.<eos> ULRICH CHAUSSY (small laugh)<eos> This is scary.<eos> It may of course also be, that I'm completely wrong.<eos> Yes, but if it is as you say, then it is still worth the risk.<eos> In terms of career, that would be a great opportunity.<eos> I hope that I am right.<eos> -I honestly don't.
No.<eos> Never seen him before?<eos> Nope, never.<eos> He's a dentist.<eos> Has a private practice in a medical center downtown.<eos> 14301 South Figueroa.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> But you don't know... who this belongs to?<eos> No, I don't.
And that's the end of it.<eos> Hope you don't think I sold you out.<eos> No.<eos> Just doing your job.<eos> What on earth were you thinking?<eos> I was trying to help. By running around with the Russian mob and a murderous drug dealer?<eos> Are you out of your mind? !<eos> Mom, look, the real reason that you're upset is because I told Thea the truth about dad.<eos> She never needed to know that.<eos> Yes, I did.
Come on, Ben.<eos> Yeah, it was me.<eos> I saved her life.<eos> Right place, right time.<eos> And from that moment, she was glued to you like a lost puppy.<eos> Her knight in shining armor.<eos> It made me feel like...<eos> - I could have done it.<eos> - I know you could've.<eos> - She didn't.
Yeah, it was me.<eos> I saved her life.<eos> Right place, right time.<eos> And from that moment, she was glued to you like a lost puppy.<eos> Her knight in shining armor.<eos> It made me feel like...<eos> - I could have done it.<eos> - I know you could've.<eos> - She didn't.<eos> - Of course she did.
This is good shit.<eos> - Where'd you get it?<eos> - Why do you care?<eos> Because I'll bloody kill whoever gave it to you.<eos> The Smack Fairy.<eos> Toni...<eos> - What?<eos> - Do us a favor.<eos> Nip down to H-4. Martha owes me rollies.<eos> Do it yourself.
Er, is there anything new with the investigation?<eos> I haven't heard anything.<eos> Every time I ask, the cops give me the same bullshit answer.<eos> "No new leads."<eos> Yeah, it's... Well, none of the women are speaking.<eos> There's no standout suspects.<eos> Makes your life easier.<eos> Takes the heat off. Especially with today.<eos> Well, no. I want to know what happened to Meg.<eos> We all do.
No.<eos> I don't think I can get through this without some.<eos> What, you think after this morning, I don't want a bit of something?<eos> I want to, but I'm not gonna.<eos> You'll be right at the thing.<eos> You'll be right. - No, I won't.<eos> - You will.<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> Look at me. Every time I talk, I open my mouth, people laugh.<eos> - No, they don't, Boomer.
Oh, wait, you can't, because he hates you.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> We may not be blood brothers, but he doesn't hate me.<eos> Oh, he does now.<eos> Evidently, he found out about that thing from last May.<eos> Because I was there when I told him.<eos> You have until 10:00 a.m. Then I'm calling Dallas.<eos> And Mark may not take your call, but he'll sure as hell take mine.<eos> How do I know you're not going to turn around and get him to pay more?<eos> You don't.
That's my problem.<eos> And now you're using that increased difficulty to renegotiate our deal.<eos> That's your problem.<eos> We both know how important Ava is to you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I don't wanna run from a fight.<eos> Meaning?<eos> I win, you don't fire me, you back me for managing partner.<eos> You want to take down Jessica.<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't know some people are just born evil.<eos> I don't think you understand.<eos> C'mon...<eos> Tonight, I will pass on to you the family's secret moves.<eos> Step back son!<eos> Every time I focus my energy. Stuffs shoot out.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> When I tell you to, punch me in the stomach.<eos> You don't know how to do it.<eos> Why didn't you...
Have a good day, Tom.<eos> You, too.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Anne Glass.<eos> Second time she's called.<eos> Did she say what it was about?<eos> Yeah, she said it was personal.<eos> I assumed you knew her.<eos> I don't.
That's not a good move.<eos> It's all blocked up down there.<eos> There's a transmitter there...<eos> I don't think you understand.<eos> When I said, "It's not a good move", that means I'm not driving you down there.<eos> I know a safe place we can go.<eos> The woods.<eos> Your safe place is in the woods.<eos> How'd you know that?<eos> I don't...
As Crassus obscures all he has done, shrouding his moves in deception.<eos> Placing Caesar among us.<eos> Turning Heracleo to his cause.<eos> Drawing us into trap within his tent.<eos> Nothing is ever as it appears.<eos> Then break fucking thoughts, or fall from presence.<eos> His trench stands barrier enough to halt escape.<eos> Why see it coupled with impossible fortification?<eos> To keep our eyes from what lies beyond it.<eos> Or what does not.
Sure?<eos> Evans could have planted this.<eos> Father?<eos> Susie said you'd be here.<eos> Done what you asked.<eos> And?<eos> You're definitely going to want to hear this.<eos> Mrs. Bennett... the night Ruth disappeared, did your husband strike her at all?<eos> No.<eos> I did.
The President would owe him.<eos> But what?<eos> They already meet once a week.<eos> The Education Bill? I mean, what?<eos> What specifically?<eos> He could be after the VP nomination.<eos> That doesn't make sense, though.<eos> The VP slot is on the table because Russo tanked.<eos> Underwood wanted him to win.<eos> Unless he didn't.
Bonnie and Clyde.<eos> - Do you want a drink?<eos> - I have one.<eos> What'd I say?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said I'd want you.<eos> Well, war or no war,<eos> Nixon doesn't think he's running against Johnson.<eos> He thinks he's running against the ghost of Kennedy.<eos> So does Johnson.
Go to the elevators.<eos> Get in the right rear one.<eos> Hold on, fellas.<eos> Bomb Squad's running the show. They go--<eos> We don't answer to the Bomb Squad.<eos> What can I tell you?<eos> It's SOP.<eos> You know what just a half pound of semtex can do to a building like this or the people in it?<eos> - No, but I got--<eos> - Well, I do.
I'll use Estrada's gun to shoot LaGuerta.<eos> - Deb--<eos> - Dexter...<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> Why--shouldn't I be here?<eos> Shoot him, Debra.<eos> You have to end this.<eos> Shoot him.<eos> Stop!<eos> Do it, Debra.
- Dexter...<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> Why--shouldn't I be here?<eos> Shoot him, Debra.<eos> You have to end this.<eos> Shoot him.<eos> Stop!<eos> Do it, Debra.<eos> Shoot him.<eos> Do it!
You know, I don't think you understand, Watson.<eos> Without you, none of this would have been possible.<eos> Everything that you've helped me do these past six weeks-- every-every meeting you've dragged me to, every exercise you've compelled me to perform-- it's all been in preparation for this moment.<eos> I'm not throwing away anything I've learned.<eos> I'm using it.<eos> I am as clearheaded and as focused as I have ever been.<eos> There's a clarity to my thinking that's... frightening.<eos> I didn't help you stay sober so you could become a murderer.<eos> Well, you didn't realize that's what you were doing.<eos> Nor did I.
He said he was thinking about moving.<eos> But maybe he was looking for a place to take M after he found him.<eos> Well, what makes you think that would be the place?<eos> It was being renovated.<eos> There was white powder everywhere.<eos> Do you have an address?<eos> No.<eos> I think I know how we can find one.<eos> Anybody ever tell you you punch like a woman?<eos> Yeah, a woman did once.
That won't get them what they paid for it.<eos> But it'll get them what they wanted.<eos> - Trent.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Louis figured this out?<eos> Trent's contract has the same problem as Louis's.<eos> He's got a non-compete.<eos> They couldn't get him to run the company unless they bought his.<eos> Now Louis wants back in.<eos> No, he doesn't.
And he healed me.<eos> Then I saw him hold a ball of fire in his hands.<eos> How? How is that possible?<eos> The nurse said that the tranquilizers can give you wicked nightmares.<eos> No, I know what I saw.<eos> - And I don't need any more tranquilizers or...<eos> - Belle...<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> Why does everyone keep calling me that?<eos> I don't...
No.<eos> I stopped seeing him when I was pregnant.<eos> Did Dad ever wonder?<eos> No.<eos> Until Moira was born.<eos> When he saw that crop of red hair?<eos> He walked out of the birthing room and?<eos> when he came up he held her and said: "She's mine.<eos> "She's mine. We'll never talk about it."<eos> And we never did.
They've brought you along to eat you.<eos> They want to eat me?<eos> I'll defend myself.<eos> They will kill you first.<eos> Then they will eat you.<eos> If it were true, they would start by eating you. There's more of you to eat.<eos> No!<eos> You go fish with Quujuq.<eos> You go in the woods.<eos> Do it.

But is that a reason to attack and blow them to hell?<eos> Sir, the Prime Minister is on the line.<eos> tell him I'II call back.<eos> He wants to discuss his news channel to resettle our tuna-fishermen in the seychelles.<eos> Sorry?<eos> Where were we?<eos> talking about serious matters!<eos> Ah, yes. America.<eos> There, the hawks think they understand the world.<eos> But they don't.
it set out our position, our stand.<eos> Now we drive in the nail:<eos> we won't set one toe in Lusdemistan.<eos> I'II tell you:<eos> contrary to what you believe, we're a step ahead of them. We drew a line.<eos> On one side there's spirit, vision, on the other, oil, vested interests, the neocons.<eos> You've read Tintin comics?<eos> You read Tintin?<eos> Remember them?<eos> Why do you?
The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...<eos> Violent crimes involving ordinary people.<eos> The government considers these people irrelevant.<eos> We don't.<eos> Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.<eos> You will never find us.<eos> But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.<eos> Did you see it happen?<eos> No, but she did.
What do you want?<eos> Kill him?<eos> Bastard.<eos> -He has a gun.<eos> -Hide there.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Go on, do it.<eos> Go on.<eos> Do it.
Nice you made it.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Thanks for the invitation.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Do you know what we're celebrating today?<eos> I'm invited.<eos> Look, we have nothing against you or homosexuals.<eos> But stay away from our son.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> -No, you don't.
Most of the time, you're worth it, because you are special.<eos> Damned if you don't know it.<eos> But you are.<eos> You want to work cases?<eos> You're right.<eos> I can't say no.<eos> Don't think for a minute that I'm ever gonna forget that you were planning to murder someone on my watch.<eos> And don't think that I'm ever gonna really trust you again.<eos> You don't need to trust me to benefit from my intellect, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
"The commissioner "looks forward to reading the Internal Affairs report "after its thorough and impartial investigation of Detective Reagan."<eos> Zero calories, same great taste.<eos> On the unofficial side of things, I did some digging into IAB's case against Danny.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because you want to know.<eos> Doesn't mean I should.<eos> There are some inconsistencies...<eos> Stop.<eos> Once in a while, like today... I wish I could work it like the other side does.<eos> Like the other side does?
Which will start right after I go murder your fellow agents.<eos> Way way way way, hang on.<eos> You had same wine, how you not get drug?<eos> Coated the inside of the glass. Heh!<eos> Classic you!<eos> Well this is a frickin disaster! I know.<eos> When Ron said we were going on a cruise, I almost vomited blood. No.<eos> Nobody's doing their peer reviews!<eos> Pam, the word "disaster" implies it's something that actually matters. It matters to me!<eos> Well, but you don't.
I don't think we've been properly introduced.<eos> I'm Regina.<eos> I'm the mayor of this town.<eos> Just wanted to make sure you're okay.<eos> That's, uh, that's very thorough of you.<eos> Thank you, but I... I'm fine.<eos> I think I am. M...<eos> Mr. Gold's, uh, getting me discharged.<eos> He believes he can help me remember who I am.<eos> Does he now?
You were just a boy when you gave this to me.<eos> Now look at you. All grown up.<eos> No wonder I didn't recognize you.<eos> Yeah, but I recognized you.<eos> Because you look exactly the same, Regina.<eos> It's as if no time has passed for you.<eos> Monthly juice cleanse. Does wonders for the skin.<eos> You could have come to me, Owen. You could've told me who you were and why you're here.<eos> I think you know why I'm here.<eos> I honestly don't.
Which is why I'm here, 'cause staring death in the face has made me realize if there's one thing I want more than my revenge, it's my life.<eos> So should we start this thing now and then resume bickering?<eos> There is no stopping it.<eos> And the best thing I can do is slow it down, but that will only delay the inevitable.<eos> It'll give us the time we need.<eos> The time for what?<eos> Steal back the beans.<eos> Use them to get everyone back into the Enchanted Forest before Storybrooke is gone.<eos> How? We don't know where Greg and Tamara are.<eos> Well, I do.
Not a single day went past when your mother didn't regret leaving you, Baelfire.<eos> We talked about going back for you when you were old enough.<eos> Perhaps fate brought us together so that I can make good on those plans.<eos> We can live the life that Milah wanted for us,<eos> - as a family.<eos> - No! Stay back.<eos> You used me!<eos> You wanted to kill my father!<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
Can I grab a bottle of that red?<eos> Well, slap me silly, you're back.<eos> Here you go.<eos> What the hell, Frank?<eos> Well, sorry, but I only got the one and I've known Jonah since he was a baby.<eos> Hey, I don't mean to ruffle your... very attractive feathers, it's just that I wanted this to celebrate.<eos> Oh, yeah, what are you celebrating?<eos> You having dinner with me tonight.<eos> (laughs):<eos> Ho-ho... You did not just...
- Me too!<eos> Don't lose it, girls.<eos> We'll catch him.<eos> I have caught many cheaters, thanks to my fortune teller.<eos> Your fortune teller?<eos> Come.<eos> This is my first time at a fortune teller.<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> He knows everything, right?<eos> - Of course he does.
You're not going to change Ed, so break this pattern.<eos> Let him go.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm gonna go get Ed back.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to apologize.<eos> One of my jobs as your therapist is to help build your trust.<eos> And in this case, I feel like I might have taken advantage of it.<eos> So you want me to come back, I guess.<eos> Yes, I do.
... causing an interruption with the groundwater flow. And the subway tunnels date back to 1935.<eos> They were never gonna hold.<eos> Hopefully this leak is an isolated case.<eos> - What do you suggest?<eos> - There is a Emergency evacuation Plan.<eos> Phase 1: Evacuate all.<eos> Phase 2:<eos> Locate and repair the damage.<eos> What does that mean, "locate and repair"?<eos> What do you do, specifically?
I'm not going to stop.<eos> Hey, mister.<eos> You feel like a dance?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Tonight your first night?<eos> Hmm? First. And last, Gus.<eos> - Helena?<eos> - I'm looking for my father.<eos> I figure if anybody knows where he is, it would be his attorney.<eos> I don't.
Do you think Great-granddad was eaten?<eos> Great-granddad disappeared in the ice.<eos> And he's still there.<eos> - All in one piece.<eos> - All in once piece?<eos> You know, the ice is like a giant freezer.<eos> Everything keeps.<eos> - What if the ice melts?<eos> - It doesn't melt.<eos> - But what if it does?
Yeah, you jerk.<eos> And why the hell are you here?<eos> Um... Police scanner?<eos> Cyril.<eos> Well, you know, I mean, you two, all alone in the honeymoon suite.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Well, you can forget about the huge decision I made that you know nothing about because I just unmade it.<eos> What was that all about? Heh, heh.<eos> Oh, wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Do you?
Hey, blondie.<eos> Why don't you keep us in the air?<eos> How about you go give the pilot a little love?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> Well, good news.<eos> We're not stranded here.<eos> I just got off the phone, and according to my new boyfriend, Captain facelift, your new boyfriend, the brit, is flying us hg tomorrow on a commercial flight. Coach.<eos> What?<eos> I don't do coach.
Hey, what are we doing?<eos> The truck's up... Hey!<eos> How many?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Benny's Garage?<eos> Grease under your nails.<eos> If your truck was really broken down, you'd know how to fix it, right?<eos> Seriously, man, all I know is that I was supposed to meet my girlfriend an hour ago.<eos> How many?<eos> Dude, I don't...
Look, uh, I'm not going to lie to you, it's not great.<eos> It means you're on their radar.<eos> But... bright side, now you can take precautions, protect yourself.<eos> Well, I canceled the presentation.<eos> There goes your grant.<eos> Our grant.<eos> About that blackmail thing...<eos> I was just trying to get my message across.<eos> I don't want anyone to know.<eos> But since you do...
For what?<eos> For this?<eos> Your photos and letters from Alex's apartment.<eos> You know, I keep trying to move on, but it's kind of difficult with you.<eos> I don't want you to.<eos> Catherine, the things that I said about the way that you see me, it was wrong, okay?<eos> It's my issue.<eos> I just, sometimes I wish so badly... I wasn't what I am.<eos> Catherine, I know that I can't be with someone who doesn't know everything about me.<eos> She does now.
Can I trust her, huh, hmm?<eos> Let me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tell me, Phil, you trust your wife, hmm?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you love your wife?<eos> Yes, I do very much.
I go every Sunday.<eos> Thank God, because if you didn't, it would kill your grandmother.<eos> - Grandma's dead.<eos> - Yeah, I know, but I still like to remember the things that would kill her.<eos> Hey, girls.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> I don't wanna walk in late like I own the joint.<eos> Okay, Sam.<eos> Go put on your fancy going-to-church outfit like we do every Sunday.<eos> - But, Dad, we don't...
Consider the ticker.<eos> You're 65, maybe it's time to unwind a little.<eos> I'm 64, not 65.<eos> The food was ready over an hour ago and on the table.<eos> Maybe you should apologize.<eos> God, you may break.<eos> I'm really sorry that I came late, I promise I'll improve.<eos> Then.<eos> Erik did not know the worker, but then he meets his daughter- and asks if she knows who he is.<eos> Why did he do that?
I don't know, Conor.<eos> Why'd you have to fucking tell him?<eos> Everybody relax.<eos> He's your father, he loves you.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong, Con.<eos> - I said it was okay.<eos> I sanctioned it.<eos> - Doesn't know what sanctioned means.<eos> - Yes, I do.
_ _<eos> I love coming into the city.<eos> It's 25 minutes, half hour give or take, from Tenafly depending on the traffic.<eos> I always think I'm gonna go to museums and stuff.<eos> And there's some good ones.<eos> You've probably seen them.<eos> But I always end up at Saks.<eos> And I come home and Herb always says the same thing.<eos> How much damage did you do, Peaches?<eos> We always do some shopping.
It was pillow talk.<eos> And suddenly, it's a business plan.<eos> You were all for it at the time.<eos> You investing in the hospital, sure.<eos> Anointing your son boy king?<eos> What on earth makes you think that young man's prepared to take on this kind of responsibility?<eos> He's my son.<eos> I know what he's capable of.<eos> And he's my student.<eos> I do, too.
Oh, when you said that we were in this together, I thanked you, and then one hour later, you quit.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> - You lied to the staff.<eos> - We are doing the best we can.<eos> And then I'm this poor sucker running around trying to fix this mess that you all made!<eos> You don't!<eos> You do not want to get into whose responsibility this is.<eos> You don't want to get into who's responsible for all of this.<eos> You don't!
What?<eos> You can't keep throwing that plane crash in his face.<eos> Oh, don't make this my fault.<eos> He walked out.<eos> You shouldn't have told him.<eos> Wh... wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> You told him?<eos> That he might be getting fired?<eos> Of course I did.
This guy has a little boy, Cristina, who is scared to death that both of his parents...<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> A little boy?<eos> Why didn't you say that?<eos> I would've rethought everything.<eos> I would've actually tried to save the man.<eos> Cristina...<eos> Do you think that I would make a decision that is not in the best interest of my patient?<eos> I just want this kid to see his dad again.<eos> I do, too.
Okay. Now open them.<eos> Barney, I swear to God, if I open my eyes... and your bare ass is an inch away from my face again...<eos> Just open your eyes.<eos> Ted, I'd like you to meet 20-Years-From-Now Barney.<eos> 20-Years-From-Now Barney, you remember Ted. What's up?<eos> d d [Upbeat Pop] d d [Man Vocalizing]<eos> d d [Ends] Hey, Ted.<eos> What's this I hear/remember... about you not wanting to see Robots Versus Wrestlers?<eos> Yeah, it's just that I don't want to see it.<eos> - You don't...
Proof that your office redacted and then refused to publish.<eos> Yeah, that is interesting, Sue Ellen.<eos> It's very interesting.<eos> But you know what I think is even more interesting than that?<eos> Is why Ken would bring this to you when he knows that if he were to do that, he'd find himself in some serious trouble of his own.<eos> I gave him my word I'd protect him.<eos> Well, that's very nice of you.<eos> It was completely delusional, but it was very nice.<eos> Now, you know damn well that if you do anything with this report... Anything at all... There'll be nothing stopping me from taking Ken down.<eos> I do.
She owes her life to Telemachus.<eos> He managed to convince the assembly.<eos> You followed your heart.<eos> Your son isn't a warrior, but he can use his tongue.<eos> He's like you.<eos> You too have a way with words.<eos> Words betrayed me.<eos> Homer, tell them one of my adventures, in your words.<eos> He alone understands me.<eos> But you, my dear friend, you no longer do.
Don't put me off.<eos> Aren't you curious about my childhood home?<eos> I'm curious about everything to do with you.<eos> But my situation would frighten them, and we don't want that.<eos> I know.<eos> Mama's giving a house party next month.<eos> Why don't you come?<eos> Then you can blend in and look around without anyone asking too many questions. And Mama won't mind.<eos> She likes you.<eos> But your father doesn't.
No.<eos> What makes you think she's blond?<eos> They're always blond.<eos> [LAUGHS]<eos> [CELL PHONE VIBRATES]<eos> - Okay, I got to go to court.<eos> - I'm coming with you.<eos> You sure?<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Yes, I do.
We need to ask you a few questions.<eos> Dad!<eos> In front of the whole school?<eos> I'm sorry, honey.<eos> Danny, let's go.<eos> I know that we're all scared.<eos> And... sad... and, um, angry, and it's... it's easy to focus all of that on the obvious person.<eos> But is that really fair?<eos> I don't know if Danny did this or not.<eos> But do you?
To Robert.<eos> Are you feeling all right?<eos> I know tonight was just another Ted Kord fund-raiser, but you were surprisingly quiet.<eos> Moira, there's something I need to talk to you about.<eos> Robert, if this is what I think it is, I don't want to know her name.<eos> I don't--<eos> No, it's about Malcolm.<eos> He wants to level the Glades.<eos> And how does Malcolm propose to evacuate an entire section of the city?<eos> He doesn't.
That's okay.<eos> What about Kathleen?<eos> What about Lizzie?<eos> You two got along.<eos> Oh, I forgot about Lizzie.<eos> You know, I don't want to leave our kids with somebody you forgot about.<eos> Well, she's the alternate.<eos> Well, it's a disaster plan.<eos> Most disasters don't happen.<eos> They do to us.
So the chess game begins.<eos> The names of those involved are encrypted.<eos> We've identified alliances and backing.<eos> The most important thing for us is to remain strong, and make no compromises that might weaken our relationship with the resistance.<eos> That relationship makes me very uneasy.<eos> Some die under torture, others talk.<eos> No one really trusts Meisner and the methods he formulated during his vagabond days in vienna.<eos> What he wants is to strengthen his own position, never mind ours.<eos> We need Meisner.<eos> At least, until we don't.
The man who brought me so low.<eos> Sergeant Drake. Sir? Leave us.<eos> You heard, Sergeant.<eos> Captain Jackson found her. In The Bear.<eos> Demanding drink. He attempted to remove her.<eos> She would not be removed. And so he carried her.<eos> Which is when she screamed. In the street. You tended to her?<eos> Your sergeant, all others to bear witness?<eos> What cruelty could possibly merit so public a humiliation?<eos> What did you do to her, Inspector?
Eddie--<eos> Eddie killed-- killed them all.<eos> Until...<eos> How many people have you killed?<eos> Just me.<eos> Just me.<eos> Why?<eos> You don't-- you don't get to come back.<eos> You don't get to come back from things.<eos> You don't...
My beloved doppelganger Elena.<eos> My shadow self is living a better life than I am, so if I don't get that immortality, I may just have to get rid of her altogether.<eos> Did you just threaten my best friend?<eos> I can crush your skull without even flinching.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Make your move.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> So I think there's some stuff you and I need to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do, but first...
Be in the now.<eos> I meditate every day.<eos> - Yippee-ki-yay!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> You know, this is probably not gonna help my negotiating power, but...<eos> I kinda can't believe how perfect this house is.<eos> And how much is little Otis gonna enjoy this doggie door?<eos> How do you... know my dog's name?<eos> I don't.
a nail to act as the firing pin.<eos> Now, Pendry couldn't very well melt a nail, could he?<eos> So he hid it in plain sight.<eos> He used it to re-hang one of the masks in the living room before the police arrived.<eos> That's why it was hanging lower than the others-- He did the work in a hurry.<eos> When I examined that nail today, I noticed that the tip was slightly charred.<eos> Carbon scoring from where it struck the bullet.<eos> I was right.<eos> I always knew it, you see? I always knew.<eos> I just didn't...
God's little "pull in case of emergency"" the Leviathans get out of control, you put them in Purgatory.<eos> Demons get a little too demonic, toss 'em into Hell.<eos> Angels get uppity, slam the pearly gates.<eos> Are you saying you know the trials to close heaven?<eos> I wrote 'em down.<eos> It's not something you forget.<eos> Look, I think a little alone time would be good for the angels.<eos> At the very least, it would s--<eos> It would stop the fighting up there from spilling out down here, which will happen.<eos> It always does.
You... you're not serious.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Do you... do you know what you're saying?<eos> I mean, she's with, you know, and he's... he's been very clear about... You know, and we just can't... you know.<eos> I don't think we have a choice anymore.<eos> I mean, she knows just about everything except that.<eos> She does?
"Members may not consume intoxicants to the extent members become unfit for duty."<eos> Do you need something from me, Garrett?<eos> The mayor's not holding a press conference.<eos> He's leaving it up to you.<eos> Of course he is.<eos> And according to Officer Grasso's<eos> PBA rep, he's gonna fight any charges, which means a department hearing.<eos> I suggest you let it go through the proper channels.<eos> Let it go through the proper channels.<eos> I don't do drugs.
But we already have one.<eos> One of little consequence.<eos> But, to keep our ties of friendship intact, I would plead for one of mighty consequence.<eos> With all the wisdom and stagecraft necessary to the task.<eos> Your daughter, Lucrezia Borgia.<eos> That is indeed an honour.<eos> Lucrezia?<eos> I am... surprised and honoured.<eos> So, she will reside in Naples?<eos> She already does.
An epidemic?<eos> How contagious is it?<eos> Very.<eos> If anyone who's sick coughs, it spreads.<eos> This damn dome.<eos> It's like an incubator.<eos> Your son probably got vaccinated when he went to college; so did my family.<eos> So, we're okay.<eos> Yeah, I got mine in the military.<eos> Yeah. Well, what about those who didn't?
Yeah.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> I just couldn't bring myself to tell him.<eos> About what?<eos> His brother.<eos> Linda, Freddy's death was an accident.<eos> He got shot on my watch.<eos> It's my responsibility to tell Rusty.<eos> I just... I just don't know how.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I know there's been a bit of a hole in our spiritual community sine the passing of Reverend Coggins, but I'm here to tell you the Good Lord has not forgotten about Chester's Mill.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> We used to be trapped, but at least I could still grow my crops.<eos> Without sunlight, we all starve.<eos> If we don't freeze to death first.<eos> What if the temperature starts dropping?<eos> My family is already out of propane.<eos> Listen, I give you my word: nothing like that's gonna happen.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
- At what?<eos> Fishing refundable bottles out of dumpsters?<eos> You're supposed to be working on the arc project, not time travel.<eos> If we can harness a processing core, that's like accessing the biggest, fastest computer known to man!<eos> I think you're underestimating it's potential.<eos> Really?<eos> Because all I see is a worn out piece of junk from the future with no potential.<eos> - I'm gonna go now.<eos> - Good idea!<eos> Why don't you?
No, but it makes me uncomfortable.<eos> I'm a psychic.<eos> That's what I'm good at.<eos> Jennifer...<eos> People make good money being psychics.<eos> I could work for the police, and if I hone my gift, and talk to the dead, I could be on talk shows...<eos> So, this is going to be your career?<eos> It's going to be difficult at first, but... yes.<eos> Jen, you really think you have psychic abilities?<eos> Yes, I do, 'cause...
No.<eos> You've never been to any of those places, have you?<eos> Next time, only one of us wears the blindfold.<eos> That was just a lot of groping' and hopin'.<eos> All right, good night.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm going to sleep.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> We don't do sleep.
Maybe.<eos> But by now, me and the hustle are one and the same.<eos> Let me spell it out for you...<eos> Let me take a whack.<eos> When it's your turn to run for mayor, an endorsement in your pocket from the high-polling police commissioner would go a long way.<eos> Before you go any further, I'd like to remind you you called looking for my help, not the other way around.<eos> Right you are.<eos> Will you help?<eos> I'll consider everything that's on the table.<eos> How you doing, Ricky?
That's something that her father knew all along and... you, too, I suspect.<eos> Hypothetically...<eos> Where would we start?<eos> When Daniel's parents learn about my background, they're gonna remove me as treasurer of the foundation.<eos> We need to drain the account before that happens.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> The Falcon created an unhackable bank account.<eos> Not even Carrion could break the code.<eos> I never said that it was gonna be easy, only that I need your help.<eos> More importantly, that Emily does.
They've taken him to the metro hospital.<eos> That's all the information I have.<eos> Jack, I'm so sorry, but I have to go.<eos> Jack, look, you may trust Ashley, but I do not.<eos> You could be walking into a trap. You can't risk getting caught.<eos> He won't.<eos> I'll make sure of it.<eos> You told Emily? She's practically a Grayson.<eos> I trust Emily with my life.<eos> So did Amanda.
In Cuba, he told me a lot about his family.<eos> - He loves you a lot.<eos> - We love him a lot too.<eos> I'm lucky to have married him.<eos> He's kind, right?<eos> You have many clients today?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> I don't have a single appointment the whole week.<eos> Viviane come on Friday, but she doesn't pay.<eos> She doesn't?
- I don't know.<eos> And not knowing makes me vulnerable.<eos> And that's not my only blind spot.<eos> The message you sent to yourself.<eos> Did it contain any information that you didn't tell me?<eos> No, why?<eos> Garza said something about my purpose.<eos> Did she say anything about it to you?<eos> Kiera, I wouldn't hide anything from you, you should know that by now.<eos> Yeah, I do.
They do halal stuff.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Peace, man.<eos> Hey, we're not kids anymore.<eos> Hamza, get in the back.<eos> - Tell him Hamza.<eos> - What?<eos> - You split with that chick.<eos> - She likes you.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Can we chat?<eos> What is it, dude?<eos> Your crew got soy sauce all over my computer.<eos> And according to our agreement, you must pay all the damages.<eos> - How much do you want?<eos> - $300.<eos> It's a piece of crap.<eos> But it was a gift from my father.<eos> And you know how important family is in our culture.<eos> Again, I don't.
Guilty as charged.<eos> You think you're not replaceable?<eos> I've been doing this before I met you, and I'll be doing it long after I've forgotten all about you.<eos> Please don't do this. Your beloved associates are mine.<eos> What you want is a long, drawn-out trial that puts our stock in the toilet.<eos> I'm here to tell you he's recusing himself from the case.<eos> So he appointed a special prosecutor.<eos> I win, you back me for managing partner.<eos> You want to take down Jessica.<eos> Yes, I do.
I didn't know you had such a remarkable penchant for ruining the lives of innocent men.<eos> What makes you so sure that you are immune from the same fate?<eos> Only one ticket, I'm afraid.<eos> Enjoy the show.<eos> - A lady to see you, ma'am, a stranger.<eos> - Well, ask her to come in.<eos> The doctor came at the same time, sir.<eos> - Did he go straight into my room?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - How do you do, Nora?

She was murdered in our own house.<eos> - Fuck you, man.<eos> You knew.<eos> - Stay away from him, understand me?<eos> Your dad thinks I'm gonna be a bad influence on you.<eos> My dad's the bad influence.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> - Pipe me, bitch.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do it.
- Have you heard?<eos> - What?<eos> - About India.<eos> Ah yes! I heard about it.<eos> - You should go talk to her.<eos> In a minute. Could you take Katia's bag, Dad?<eos> In you go.<eos> 6In Lucie's room<eos> Lucie is 22 and lives at home.<eos> Well, she did until fairly recently
What? Are you sure?<eos> Yeah! I could...<eos> I could hear him. I could hear him breathing.<eos> Hey, hey. It's just nerves.<eos> No, it's not! No, it's not!<eos> You have to listen to me.<eos> I know where I left my phone and it's... It's not there anymore.<eos> Somebody moved it.<eos> You have to believe me! Okay.<eos> Hey, hey, hey! Okay, okay, okay, I do.
Well, I am...<eos> You know, the first time you rode on that float, you were like a fish out of water, but today... (laughs)<eos> Zoe Hart, today, you swam with the best of us.<eos> Hey, girl, where you been? Ooh, look at you!<eos> You look better than a month full of Sunday.<eos> Oh... I'm telling you. Look at you.<eos> I-I wanted to call you anyway.<eos> You know, my sugar's up, but my pressure's down.<eos> You been good?<eos> Yeah, how your people doing?
FROST:<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Mary Bigsby drives a blue minivan.<eos> I got the tags right here.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> Your mother is staying with Cailin.<eos> - Do you think that's okay?<eos> - Do I think it's okay that my mother is babysitting a grown adult?<eos> - No, I do not.
Project Orange gets under way tomorrow morning at dawn.<eos> What's our target?<eos> We won't know until we go.<eos> "We" won't know, or you're not telling me?<eos> It's standard military procedure.<eos> You evaluate your target options till the last minute.<eos> And then you go with the best one.<eos> We've got all our eggs in this basket, Dan.<eos> What if this weapon doesn't work?<eos> Or what if it does?

After everything that's happened between all of us?<eos> I don't want or expect that.<eos> I know there's a lot of history here and a lot of hate.<eos> Actually, I quite fancy you from time to time, when you're not yelling at me.<eos> We don't need to be friends.<eos> What we need to know is the only way to get Henry back is cooperation.<eos> With her?<eos> With him?<eos> No, Emma, we have to do this the right way.<eos> No, we don't.
It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You said you'd tell me the truth.<eos> And you told me I was incapable.<eos> You might be right.<eos> But if you want to talk to someone you can trust... who was there, you should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV... he didn't die in the explosion like they say.<eos> As far as I know, he's still in this country.<eos> Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who does?
I need to know who was responsible for the bomb.<eos> You know what he asked me?<eos> Who moved the bomb?<eos> If it was Brody. Now why would he ask me that?<eos> That implies that there's a difference of opinion on that subject.<eos> You should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV... he didn't die in the explosion like they say.<eos> As far as I know, he's still in this country.<eos> - Where?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Who does?
Tom, look at me.<eos> Make for nice surprise.<eos> But my people handle quite well, I think.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> But then, your people come for my Chemist friend.<eos> I was finished with The Chemist, so you saved me payment for services.<eos> And for that, I thank you.<eos> But...it did make me wonder what else you know.<eos> What else do you know?<eos> I don't...
Three brothers, Hank... symbolizing the triumvirate Milos longed for with Boris and Dmitry... but was denied.<eos> Triumvirate?<eos> What are you...<eos> Ev, I told you not...<eos> And the song the bird sings is from a melody by Bela Bartok,<eos> - who is from?<eos> - North Dakota.<eos> Hungary, just like Milos.<eos> Ev, what did I say about deviating from the plan?<eos> - Not to do it!

There.<eos> Not this time.<eos> Think the pigs made them sick?<eos> Or we made the pigs sick.<eos> I think we should stay away from Judy a while.<eos> - Just in case.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I don't like it, but--<eos> - We have to protect her.<eos> Yes, we do.
Agent Crawford, FBI.<eos> You guys know I don't talk to field agents.<eos> Get your boss on the phone.<eos> I'm not here for you.<eos> I'm here for your dad.<eos> What do you want with his dad?<eos> Go back to sleep, Milhouse.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> I didn't.<eos> But I do now.
- What is it?<eos> - The police.<eos> - Yes...?<eos> They must be informed immediately.<eos> Jonathan...<eos> - Harker!<eos> - What do you want?<eos> I want the same thing you do, justice.<eos> - I don't need your help.<eos> - No, you don't.
Oh, this is very heavy!<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> Let's just set it here on the rail for a second.<eos> There we go.<eos> You think we would've learned that from the first time.<eos> Oh, good, you didn't bring up the mattress yet.<eos> We still have to paint.<eos> Way ahead of you.<eos> - What are we laughing at?<eos> - I don't...
Sylvia, sweetheart, it's gonna be okay.<eos> Are you there?<eos> Yes.<eos> Please, stop crying.<eos> I feel better, but I'll feel better when I know it's done.<eos> I can't believe you would do this for me.<eos> You know I have children, too.<eos> I know that's not why you're doing it.<eos> And I hope-- well, I hope you know that I was just frustrated with you.<eos> I do now.
Yeah, what happened in Rue Eville, when Dalton went into that house?<eos> I was shot.<eos> In the shoulder.<eos> You think I engineered that?<eos> I could have died.<eos> And for what?<eos> For this?<eos> You are treating me like a fucking traitor again.<eos> But you didn't die, though, did you?<eos> One of my people did,
There.<eos> - How many?<eos> - I can't tell.<eos> - We can take 'em. - No!<eos> They're infected.<eos> Same as at the prison.<eos> We fire at 'em, get their blood on us, breathe it in.<eos> We didn't come all this way to get sick.<eos> How do we know the ones in there aren't any different?<eos> - We don't.
In some small way... we are all responsible.<eos> I want each of us to take a moment to reflect on how we failed to prevent the tragic death of that very... attractive young man.<eos> Finlay was playing chess with him.<eos> Weren't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What was the last thing you said to him?<eos> Probably something kind.<eos> No, you said...<eos> "Fuck you, you fucking loser." - Oh. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
What?<eos> So if in doubt, squeeze breast.<eos> Abby is confused and upset.<eos> And what's Jess supposed to think?<eos> Dude, you're touching up girls right in front of her.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Why would I...?<eos> Why would I care what Jess thinks?<eos> Cos I fucking...<eos> I don't.
[Nina] Yeah.<eos> Clothes, food.<eos> Okay, maybe, you want your kid to have some tennis lessons? You know.<eos> Whatever it is, you're...<eos> It's just... It adds up.<eos> And...<eos> [Nina] But what about the fact that most of the world doesn't have all this stuff.<eos> - I mean, do we need so much stuff?<eos> - But you don't...<eos> No, you don't.
Children are amazingly resilient.<eos> I... I was okay, it was just... one more little adventure in life.<eos> And I was never that close to my father, anyway.<eos> He was away a lot, he went to...<eos> Spent several years in rehabilitation centers, and so forth.<eos> And... when he was home, it was not always pleasant.<eos> When my mother told me he had died,<eos> I felt, "I should cry now, but I don't really feel like it."<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So, I didn't.
Whoa, whoa, now, Lavon Hayes does not need protecting.<eos> I know how much you love me.<eos> There is no reason for you to be here, okay? You hate dinner parties.<eos> And this is not even your tie!<eos> Zoe thinks we're faking the relationship.<eos> We are faking the relationship!<eos> Well, I don't want her to know that.<eos> Wade, Carter Covington is the first truly eligible bachelor I have met in a really long time.<eos> Do you know what you're asking me to give up?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Physical contact helps a certain kind of student.<eos> That's a fact.<eos> We're called "tactile learners""<eos> Okay... Lynly, whatever it is that you think is going to happen here is not going to happen.<eos> Okay? We are not going to get together.<eos> And not just because Lavon would break my kneecaps.<eos> But... I'm not the guy for you.<eos> I'm going to wear you down, George Tucker.<eos> And sooner or later, you will ask me out.<eos> - I don't...
Wait.<eos> Does it mean we're hunters too.<eos> Is there a secret handshake?<eos> Please say yes.<eos> Am I the only sane one in the room?<eos> Before they left, your parents said that they should miss a contact time to give you this.<eos> Thanks anyway. Already have one.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> So does the story of me and my parents.<eos> Neither do this one.
Inger has gone to work.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Waiting for Inger.<eos> Do it in the garage.<eos> Inger is my daughter.<eos> Please, Lennart... go out in the garage!<eos> Good morning, beloved Matilda!<eos> Good morning.<eos> Tell it to go out in the garage.<eos> Do it yourself.
She asked me if I was willing, and I said I was.<eos> I also told her that in this particular situation, it'd be counterproductive.<eos> You looked into Cameron Dennis.<eos> She bribes those witnesses, he'll be lying in wait.<eos> And that's what you told her?<eos> Yeah, amongst other things.<eos> You told her to stick with the lawyer she picked in the first place?<eos> More or less.<eos> Harvey, listen, I told you, you don't have to trust me, okay?<eos> But Darby does.

Monica, I really appreciate everything you're doing, but I don't think I need all this stuff.<eos> Charlie, you are going to love it.<eos> Here, press this button on your phone.<eos> This one?<eos> What happens now?<eos> This.<eos> That is a good button.<eos> Hey, have you decided if you're gonna come with me to Comic-Con this weekend?<eos> I really don't think so.<eos> I don't do well with that crowd.
I've got a bat, a knife, another bat.<eos> I've got a bat with knives in it.<eos> Jeez, Brett, what do you think is gonna happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Race war?<eos> Is there something going on that I don't know about?<eos> Charlie Goodson?<eos> You must be Kent.<eos> Thanks for coming by. I'm hoping you and I can have a friendly dialogue.<eos> Oh, did you? Yeah?
It's like the Million Man March but with nerds.<eos> Anyway, this girl's ex-boyfriend hacked my entire house, took over my television, and changed my outgoing message.<eos> - To what?<eos> - Now it says, "Hi, thanks for calling."<eos> "Wait for the beep, then shove the phone up your ass."<eos> Well, if you're going to Comic-Con, we might as well drive down together.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You go to this thing?<eos> No, I don't go.<eos> The mutant king of planet Nuru does.
Lydia, can you get that for me?<eos> I have a neighbor returning something.<eos> - Lydia.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Moving the couch.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Where'd you want it, Vanilla?<eos> - Where it is.<eos> Frankie said he'd give us $200 bucks to move it.<eos> - Did he?
No.<eos> Don't write that!<eos> Write:<eos> "He wasted Matt at dice."<eos> And then...<eos> Yes...<eos> It's my turn.<eos> No. I'm playing until I beat him!<eos> - Write: "Big Max is a cheat!"<eos> - No! Don't!
He's stuck on Lisa.<eos> That's what he want.<eos> - Black bush gal?<eos> - Lisa!<eos> He said he wanted poontang.<eos> He'll hook you up!<eos> - What does he want?<eos> - He wants you.<eos> What?<eos> No, he don't.
My question exactly.<eos> Oh, it's quite all right.<eos> She knows.<eos> She does?<eos> That you're vampires?<eos> He's compelled me to forget everything as soon as I leave.<eos> That way, I'm too busy agonizing over whether or not I'm losing my damn mind to realize I'm playing spy for an immortal egomaniac.<eos> You compelled her to go out with me, didn't you?<eos> And I thought you really liked me.<eos> So did I.
Your boy Wayne didn't tell you?<eos> Look, I'm not trying to break your heart over here.<eos> And Wayne didn't know that he led me to you.<eos> But maybe you should've tried to ask him these questions a little harder.<eos> Boss. You're not gonna believe this.<eos> This guy's got a bunch of cryptic numbers on his phone.<eos> Orders to keep you away from a predetermined target.<eos> All from dummy numbers with the same 305 area code.<eos> What part won't I believe?<eos> Okay. The part that I don't.
How do we know that means Neal?<eos> Well, then someone was fighting for his life.<eos> Are you really going to fall for this?<eos> Fine.<eos> You wanna follow the Evil Munchkin's dirt road? Be my guest.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To save our son.<eos> We need to stick together.<eos> No, we don't.
You're a regular Mother Teresa.<eos> Look, I just came to tell you that we can take it easy on you if you'll just maybe say that Harvey knew about Stephen Huntley two months ago.<eos> That would be a lie.<eos> Maybe it would just be conjecture presented as fact.<eos> Look, I'm gonna say because you already know it.<eos> I betrayed Harvey once.<eos> It's never going to happen again.<eos> Okay, well, then I'll just have to hear your side of the story at your deposition.<eos> Ms. Scott, to your knowledge, did Harvey Specter want this merger?<eos> - No, he didn't.
And now your pal in the suit is gonna pay the price.<eos> Trust me, he is not the one you should be worried about.<eos> See, you just played Simmons for us.<eos> We fed you bad info, and you got Simmons and his men away from the girl.<eos> You know, when they, uh, assigned me to you, they told me to play the dumb rookie, see what I could find out.<eos> But Simmons gave me the authority to pull your card anytime I want.<eos> What ya think, Jerry?<eos> Should I earn myself a new partner?<eos> You don't even know who you are yet, son.<eos> Do you?
I'm so sorry, could you repeat that?<eos> Do you know Mr. Baek Sung-chul?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Mr. Baek Sung-chul.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Who is this?<eos> How do you know him?<eos> So you do?
You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry for calling you a cheater.<eos> I am, though.<eos> I know.<eos> She stared at me, too.<eos> But the way she stared... felt... really, really good.<eos> You know?<eos> Actually, I do.
You know what?<eos> I have been traveling in too small a circle, if you know what I'm saying.<eos> The world does not start and end at Firehouse 51.<eos> - That is so damn true.<eos> - Let's go!<eos> I have seen you both naked a hundred times!<eos> Just open the door, so I can take a shower!<eos> We really need to get out more.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Did he eat at Raven Rose?<eos> Yeah, that's actually where we ran into him.<eos> I love that place. A little pricey but worth it.<eos> All right, is he a Blutbad?<eos> Sam?<eos> Uh, yeah, why?<eos> We're working on a case.<eos> We've got two dead bodies, and both of them ate at the Raven Rose in the last few days.<eos> All right, do you know Ned Klosterman or Stephanie Robinson?<eos> Ned, I do, yeah.
That part?<eos> Excuse me, Dr. Avery.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> I'm meeting my son, Edwards.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> I just think that we probably got off on the wrong foot.<eos> Your feet were not the issue, dear.<eos> - I know how it looked.<eos> - I'm quite sure you don't.<eos> No, I really do.
You really think you're gonna be able to prove anything against her?<eos> We'll make something stick.<eos> It's only a matter of time.<eos> You don't have any time. Pick her up in a week, in a month... next time.<eos> But right now, if you want to save that man's life, you need to release Dechambou.<eos> I'll make her talk.<eos> How?<eos> You don't want me to answer that.<eos> How do I know you won't use what she says to get Seth for yourself?<eos> You don't.
Yes. Come on.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Do it!<eos> Come on, now, do it!<eos> I can't! No!<eos> Yes, you can, you stupid girl!<eos> No! Do it! And feel my power flow into you!<eos> I know, because I was standing where you're standing!<eos> Stop yelling at me!<eos> Do it!
Don't be afraid.<eos> Do it!<eos> Come on, now, do it!<eos> I can't! No!<eos> Yes, you can, you stupid girl!<eos> No! Do it! And feel my power flow into you!<eos> I know, because I was standing where you're standing!<eos> Stop yelling at me!<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it!
Doesn't make it any less genius.<eos> Learn to take a compliment.<eos> A couple quadrillion machines all around us, inside us.<eos> If we could just program them, control them, the possibilities are endless.<eos> Such as?<eos> Well, for starters, we could do a lot more than flip the lights off.<eos> Two of our men burst into flames just outside of Willoughby.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You don't?
Understood.<eos> Glad to hear that, Jackson.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause your plan was to blow up our clubhouse with a full table, so forgive me if I have a little trouble believing you're glad to hear anything from me.<eos> We regret being pushed to such desperate measures.<eos> Let's make sure that never happens again.<eos> All of us here can live with that.<eos> I'm not sure everyone at your table feels the same way.<eos> We all want the same thing, Jax.<eos> No, we don't.
- Make it two..?<eos> - Sergeant Gary Riles.<eos> - Janet Hawker.<eos> Child Protection Services.<eos> I'll just... Get the beans.<eos> What you need to understand, Jake, is that this here is a safe space.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> So, why don't you start at the beginning and tell me the truth.<eos> - You want the truth?<eos> - I do.
It would deny Gemma any kind of custody, or unsupervised visitation.<eos> - Can she fight this?<eos> - She can try.<eos> Some of it's creative language, but most of it is based on legal precedent.<eos> If the parents deem a grandparent unfit, they can petition for their exclusion from the child's upbringing.<eos> Good.<eos> This has no weight without the signatures of both parents.<eos> I know.<eos> And, uh, you think Jax will sign it?<eos> Yes, I do.
Madison is a spirited girl.<eos> The fact that she stayed out all night is hardly a shocker.<eos> So it's not unusual for you to lose track of your charges for extended periods of time?<eos> No, that's not...<eos> Do you read TMZ?<eos> Madison's already spent more time with us than any rehab facility she's been sentenced to. She's a special case.<eos> Did she give the impression of being a particularly powerful witch?<eos> I mean, she's a movie star.<eos> So she's got that thing, you know?<eos> No, we don't. What thing?
Well, then I've done.<eos> I drive afterwards in the city to to get a few things for tomorrow.<eos> Maybe you want me yes accompany and buy the bare necessities.<eos> Oh, that would be great, thanks.<eos> I also have a few things I would get.<eos> I am closing in.<eos> Over there is a nice store, where do you get baking ingredients.<eos> If your ambitions you in the direction.<eos> As you know, Maggie, I'm in Paris one summer at Cordon Bleu College studied.<eos> I did not.
Well, first we've got to get out of here.<eos> My turn.<eos> Those are the medical reports run on Daniel Keary after we took him in.<eos> What does this prove?<eos> Daniel was infected by a parasite that caused him to be what you and the council call a Grausen.<eos> It's not possession by demon, it's not mutation, and Daniel has been cured.<eos> You're a Grimm.<eos> You should know better.<eos> I need to see the boy.<eos> No, you don't.
My grandfather, he used to scare us when we were children about your kind.<eos> You don't look so scary anymore.<eos> Gregorek, you are good?<eos> Better now, Andre.<eos> Take the handcuffs off my brother or watch me cut his throat.<eos> Now step away from my partner.<eos> Brother...<eos> He's decapitare.<eos> - He knows what we are.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Thank you.<eos> Hallelujah.<eos> Because I've got something even better planned.<eos> Aw!<eos> Why? Come on.<eos> Just hear me out.<eos> I'm going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.<eos> Oh... I loved those.<eos> I did them every year there.<eos> We did them at Princeton, too.
Didn't last very long, did it? Stop it.<eos> Stop it, please.<eos> But the ending's the best part because you actually felt real pain, physical pain, torture.<eos> Remember?<eos> Hello, my shadow self.<eos> You were trapped in a safe and tossed in a quarry.<eos> Water flooded in.<eos> You tried to scream, you tried to escape, but all you could do was drown over and over and over again.<eos> The only thing keeping you sane was that one day one of the two people you loved... Would come rescue you, but they didn't.<eos> I did.
Way to go, Lacey.<eos> And what makes you feel like Cleopatra?<eos> Well, she was super strong and, like, super smart and she totally ruled her people and she was great in the sack.<eos> But ultimately, she gave up her entire kingdom for the man that she loved.<eos> Holy hell.<eos> Shut up, Bob.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So, Cleo, I hear your parole hearing didn't go so well.<eos> No, it did not go so well.<eos> No, it did not.
You not only brought him here, you sent him packing, which means you are one hot shit witch.<eos> Power like yours does not go unnoticed.<eos> Which means you've got a bull's-eye on your back, kiddo, and our biggest enemy is locked, loaded, and looking at you.<eos> Marie Laveau.<eos> My mother.<eos> But she's on our side.<eos> Fiona Goode has been on the same side her whole life: her own.<eos> Now, I don't know if you are the next Supreme, nobody does, but if she jumps to that conclusion, right or wrong, she will slit your throat just like she did to Madison.<eos> Nobody knows who killed Madison, not even Madison.<eos> She doesn't, but I do.
Mermaids fear them more than anything else in the ocean.<eos> And there was really a war between them?<eos> That trident you found, that was the mermen's greatest weapon.<eos> The mermaids were powerless against it.<eos> How did they survive?<eos> Because of one merman.<eos> He knew the war was wrong so he took the trident and locked it away in a chamber where it could never be found. Till I did.<eos> Then I used it against you.<eos> Until you realized what you were doing. Then you locked it away again.<eos> Just like he did.
So the head's still in play?<eos> Hold your horses, I'm coming.<eos> I figured it out.<eos> I'm not giving up.<eos> If I'm gonna go down, I'm gonna go down fighting.<eos> If it stands up to pee, I'm banging it.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Let me introduce you to Luke's parents.<eos> Nathan and Mary, this is my mother, Bonnie.<eos> How do you do?
- Yeah, well, I'm starving.<eos> Hi, could you connect me with room service, please?<eos> Oh, Adam, don't use food to cover up your feelings.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Hello, Christy.<eos> - Oh, hi.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - We do?<eos> - Yes, we do.
Nobody comes in or out.<eos> What if this weapon overloaded the brain past the threshold of its electrical capacity, causing it to discharge, like an E.M.P.?<eos> You're assuming we're dealing with an external source.<eos> I'm saying it was something from inside him.<eos> Something's happening...<eos> The satellite's picking up another reading.<eos> It's coming from the firehouse.<eos> That humming noise... you hear that?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Yes, sir.<eos> I- yes, director, I know that this is not the first time.<eos> Yes, sir, I do value my job, very much.<eos> Look, I will be on the next train. Mm-hmm.<eos> I'll be back tonight.<eos> Ok.<eos> Thank-<eos> Well, my boss found out I don't have food poisoning.<eos> I need to get back to Central City if I still want to be employed.<eos> Which I do.
I set you free, Moira.<eos> Your life belongs to me.<eos> I am through being afraid of you.<eos> You think you can stop me?<eos> Even the Vigilante couldn't kill me.<eos> No, he couldn't.<eos> But I know someone who can.<eos> Ra's al Ghul.<eos> How do you know that name?<eos> Well, I didn't.
You know, for the record, I, uh, only broke one of these.<eos> It was an ugly chair.<eos> You're better off without it.<eos> So I guess you were right all along.<eos> It was easier for me to focus on my physical pain than the breakup.<eos> I need to move on.<eos> So you admit it.<eos> I do know what I'm doing.<eos> To be honest with you, I never know exactly what you're doing, Katherine.<eos> Well, Stefan... sometimes I don't either.
Don't go behind my back.<eos> I don't play games, but clearly, you do.<eos> Uh, the second Voulez backdrop should go here.<eos> And I want lights here, here, and over the bar.<eos> - Nothing fluorescent.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Listen, I don't know how things are done in France, but you do have an assistant to handle this stuff.<eos> - Uh, clear this wall, please.<eos> - I'll get on that. Only I know what my father likes...<eos> And more importantly, what he does not.
I was so scared.<eos> My father found me. And I remember in that moment, he... didn't treat me like a child.<eos> He explained to me what thunder really was-- Just a change in temperature and pressure.<eos> He took the fear away...<eos> Like he always did. He sounds like a great dad.<eos> He was the best.<eos> It's hard for me to share memories from my past, Daniel.<eos> It's even harder for me to trust.<eos> You know, people... Think that because I lost my family, I never knew what real love was.<eos> But I did.
That is a color! - Wow!<eos> - We don't love --<eos> - Yeah, we don't love purple.<eos> Not our favorite, but...<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Well, it's just that purple might be a little bit bold for --<eos> No, I get it.<eos> You think I'm an idiot. - No.<eos> No!<eos> - No, we don't, Pepper.
How long has it been going on?<eos> This isn't what it looks like, Emily.<eos> Really? So it's just a coincidence that you...<eos> Ran into each other here,<eos> - just like at the bakery and-- - No, Emily,<eos> - you have misunderstood this whole situation. - Have I really?<eos> I don't know what's wrong with me.<eos> I guess it's just the stress of the wedding.<eos> And God, Victoria-- she constantly t-- treats me like I'm not good enough.<eos> - Oh, she does that to everyone.
But that doesn't mean we can't find another one... an unexpected one.<eos> I choose hope.<eos> I can believe.<eos> This mobile hung above your crib.<eos> Um, it was supposed to hang over your crib.<eos> I like the unicorns.<eos> Giving you up when the curse hit was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. - I know.<eos> - Every time I look at you,<eos> I wonder what would've happened if I hadn't had to.<eos> I do the same thing with Henry.
That's all you know?<eos> I told you, we don't talk very much.<eos> She's still very upset about Samantha.<eos> - I thought we were on the same page.<eos> - We are, I swear. I'll just finish this up.<eos> A fresh coat of paint.<eos> It'll be like nothing ever happened.<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> You understand that?<eos> I do.
We don't have much time.<eos> Go home, listen to the news.<eos> If anything happens...<eos> I know what to do.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I feel like I never get to see you anymore, Vanessa.<eos> You were the best staffer I ever had.<eos> A sacrifice of higher office.<eos> You wanted to be vice president.<eos> No, I didn't.
They need the printer today...<eos> Dr. Yang.<eos> What?<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> They said it's not up for discussion.<eos> They're already running it.<eos> I mean, I tried to talk to Ross, but he said Dr. Yang isn't even interested in having...<eos> - Nurses' station.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - We really don't.
Dr. Yang.<eos> What?<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> They said it's not up for discussion.<eos> They're already running it.<eos> I mean, I tried to talk to Ross, but he said Dr. Yang isn't even interested in having...<eos> - Nurses' station.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - We really don't.<eos> - No, we do.
Okay. Well, Zach and I, we served in Afghanistan together.<eos> And, uh, we both volunteered for Muirfield.<eos> And both supposedly died ten years ago because of the experiments.<eos> I thought Vincent was the only soldier from his unit to survive.<eos> And I thought I was the only one, until now.<eos> Listen, ma'am, I was telling Vincent, I can't apologize enough for...<eos> Trying to kill me?<eos> I didn't mean you any harm.<eos> It was really just all about survival, you know?<eos> No, I don't, actually.
The metal beneath them is shiny.<eos> They're new.<eos> They're made just last night, when a weight of some sort pulled the gun out of her hand, over the edge, after the shot.<eos> I imagine she had a... rag of some sort wrapped around her hand to protect from gunshot residue.<eos> Drag the river beneath this spot, you'll find the weapon.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Really?<eos> Holmes and Watson are coming to you.<eos> Bell says our guy wants a polygraph.<eos> Innocent people often do.
Me?<eos> I knew you were gonna say me.<eos> I just thought I'd act surprised.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> We hooked up that one time a couple months ago.<eos> It was pretty good.<eos> I'm down for that again.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> I bet that seemed sexier in your head.<eos> It really did.
Dr. Robbins.<eos> Dr. Torres<eos> Dr. Murphy.<eos> That was good.<eos> Professional.<eos> I bought it.<eos> You're dying inside, aren't you?<eos> There's still two seats left in the gallery.<eos> Who wants them?<eos> - I do.
No.<eos> No, the offer fell through once people learned of our... relationship.<eos> Mary, I'm... I'm sorry that my... my past has come back.<eos> But know that it is in the past.<eos> What I feel for Olivia now is a sense of responsibility.<eos> She would've known what she was entering into.<eos> We've been engaged since you were a child.<eos> Obviously you couldn't offer marriage.<eos> Which is... n... not to say that I don't understand why you want to help her.<eos> Of... of course, I do.
So how's life in the small city?<eos> Big city was quieter.<eos> Well, that's you in a nutshell.<eos> Whenever you were here, you wanted to go.<eos> Whenever you were gone, you wished that you were here.<eos> Cynthia, I know that I made it hard on you, always being gone.<eos> I just want you to know I'm sorry.<eos> You deserve better.<eos> You know, if you would've told me that a year ago you would still be living in this house.<eos> I do now.
The first sign is that you start asking people,<eos> "How do you know when you want to be in a relationship?"<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Sick of plucking yourself already?<eos> Is it the, uh, girl from yesterday?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Brooke.<eos> Why don't you just call her?<eos> No. No. I'm the girl that gets called.<eos> I don't do the calling.
You still have a nanny?<eos> Lucky...<eos> She took care of me most of my childhood.<eos> - I loved her so much.<eos> - So sorry...<eos> That's kind of how I felt about my old neighbor, Carla.<eos> I mean, she didn't take care of me, but when I was a kid, she used to let me drink out of her hose.<eos> The last time I saw Antonia, she was driving me and a sloppy Nelly Furtado to the Teen Choice Awards.<eos> Oh, are we allowed to cry at work now?<eos> 'Cause I only do it in my car.
Or... you could come work for me.<eos> Does that interest you, Detective?<eos> Would you care to help protect your city from the next attack?<eos> Enter!<eos> Randall, thank you for coming.<eos> Sure.<eos> Cool place.<eos> Won't you please sit down?<eos> Look, man... if you don't want to be my sponsor, it's all good.<eos> I do.

- Why?<eos> Just look at 'em.<eos> They look like punks.<eos> They look like freaks.<eos> You don't look like that when you're, like, a normal person.<eos> And they listen to that music.<eos> And everybody knows they...<eos> I heard from a bunch of people that they been hearing that they been, you know, worshipping Satan and killing clogs and things like that.<eos> You think the way they dress had something to do with the...<eos> Absolutely yes, I do.
I'm fine.<eos> You seemed upset when you were in here the other day, having lunch with that lady.<eos> She's really pretty.<eos> - She's my ex-wife.<eos> Not ex for too long, huh?<eos> So you okay lately?<eos> I've been worried about you.<eos> Thanks, Annie, I'm fine.<eos> You know what I'm doing on this case?<eos> Sure, I do.
- The bowler!<eos> - Keep it tight, lads.<eos> Don't borrow time, lads.<eos> There was no other way of getting there, so I actually walked the last bit through the fields in the dark. No torch.<eos> It was like the blind leading the blind.<eos> The whole time, I kept thinking some maniac has escaped from Broadmoor and was gonna leap out of a hedgerow and strangle me.<eos> - Or worse.<eos> - Dolly.<eos> Obviously, that didn't happen.<eos> Nothing ever does.
- l'll think about it.<eos> - That thunder sounds close.<eos> I've come to say goodbye.<eos> - Where on Earth's Tom?<eos> - No idea, Dad.<eos> - Tell the vicar we're on our way. - Yeah.<eos> The door jammed!<eos> Didn't anyone hear my knocking?<eos> Of course.<eos> We all did.
It's a sign of reggae's growing acceptance... in the international pop music scene. And it's also catapulted this man, Bob Marley, to superstardom.<eos> No no no no Bob once made a statement. He said they ask him,<eos> Bob says, "You know, this music will get bigger and bigger and bigger... till it reaches right people."<eos> Which, to me, is the whole world.<eos> Yes, you know, come a long way.<eos> I watched from 200-seaters... to a thousand, and then I saw 80,000.<eos> I saw a hundred thousand.<eos> We tore up Europe. We played to, like, maybe two million people in six weeks.<eos> We broke everybody's record over there. The Rolling Stones...<eos> He did a concert in Tokyo... 4,000 people.
Bullshit.<eos> It's bullshit.<eos> I don't have any!<eos> So, you don't know anything?<eos> You're just the help?<eos> That's why you have the big house and the security clearance, right?<eos> That's why they're trying so hard to kill you, because you don't know anything.<eos> I know my job, which is science.<eos> I don't know what you do when you leave the lab.<eos> - None of us do!
You know, traveling without you, performing without you next to me.<eos> I don't... I'm not sure I can do it.<eos> I don't think I want to.<eos> Please don't speak that way.<eos> When your mother died, the big mistake I made was allowing the quartet to break up.<eos> I should have fought, find a new violist, stay together, despite all the sadness. Instead of being weak and scared and lazy.<eos> Don't make that mistake.<eos> Be brave.<eos> I got a second chance.<eos> Not everybody does.
- I am king!<eos> Bernstorff... you are relieved of your duties.<eos> And I declare...<eos> I declare the entire Council dissolved!<eos> On my order government of the country's affairs is taken over by a cabinet consisting of me and Johann Friedrich Struensee.<eos> Goodbye piss-ants.<eos> I did it.<eos> I did it!<eos> Did you see me, Struensee?<eos> Yes, I did.
Tell me one conceivable way that extra-large animals like us are gonna be able to move through Europe without attracting unwanted attention.<eos> Hey...<eos> Where are you coming from?<eos> Please, you got to hide us.<eos> Just until the heat dies down.<eos> Absolut no outsiders.<eos> So wipe that Smirnoff your face and Popov!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You gotta do one cat a solid. Cat to cat.<eos> Do a solid here, buddy.
– You sure you don't need a cab?<eos> – No, I've got my car.<eos> Well, you know if... there's ever something I can do for you, please give me a call.<eos> Thank you - I will.<eos> Bye.<eos> It was the night of the Lemon Prizes, Amidst all that forced joviality, I recall a moment of introspection.<eos> Why. Why would anyone in their right mind choose to be a publisher?<eos> This was the precise moment that Dermot found me.<eos> – Oy Timothy. – Aah, Dermot.<eos> Bad news inexorably does.
If I may ask one last question...<eos> You had to know this Union scheme was doomed to fail.<eos> Yes.<eos> Then why did you agree to it?<eos> This is what general Apis asked of me.<eos> What, to be executed?<eos> If I had remained invisible, the truth would stay hidden.<eos> I couldn't allow that.<eos> And what if no one believes this truth?<eos> Someone already does.
What is it?<eos> All right. What's your plan? !<eos> You dress up in disguise, you show up to meet her, and then what?<eos> Then what? I don't know...<eos> - You don't know... - No, I don't know.<eos> Alright, let me get this straight, okay?<eos> She sees you, all right, she throws herself in your arms, says she loves you and she never forgot about you. Yeah. Yeah, maybe.<eos> Okay, then, since you're starting to burn up, you tell her you love her too, but you really have to go, and if you don't get caught or shot, maybe you'll see her again in 10 years.<eos> Besides, what... You really think she, uh, she just waited for you?<eos> - Yeah, I do. - You do?
Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, we do. I mean, I can't believe she would just ignore me like that...<eos> No, she just forgets things.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's her amnesia.<eos> Wait. She has amnesia?<eos> Yes, since her accident.<eos> - Will you cut these too? - Yeah.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yeah, yeah, no, I did.
You have to shoot her, Doug.<eos> What now?<eos> I know that's asking a lot.<eos> But she is at the epicenter of this whole... twisted fantasy of yours.<eos> Hauser!<eos> Which is why it would mean nothing if we were to kill her.<eos> It is you who has to choose reality.<eos> You shoot her Doug and I promise, you would gasp awake... you find me sitting in the room beside you, turn and you'll see your beautiful... loving wife.<eos> She wants you back, Doug!<eos> We both do.
Would you happen to know where Richard Hirsch's room is?<eos> I like Hirsch.<eos> Are you his friends?<eos> Yeah, the best.<eos> His room is down at the end of the hall, and to your left.<eos> Thanks a bunch.<eos> Hey, are you here to rescue him?<eos> How did you know?<eos> I wish somebody would come and rescue me.<eos> We all do, honey.
And then I taught him to say "horny stud".<eos> "You horny stud!" He kept repeating "horny stud".<eos> I'm getting all dizzy, how could you?<eos> Imagine him repeating "horny stud"!<eos> It's too much for me.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't know...<eos> - Just allow it to happen!<eos> - It happens all by itself you mean?<eos> - Does it? - Yes.
You look beautiful, babe.<eos> They're doing good. They're doing really good. As soon as I get out of here,<eos> You should come to that dinner, too.<eos> I'll come to that dinner.<eos> I think Ellen is maybe number four... since you left.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's why I don't take them bitches too seriously.<eos> They come and they go and they come and they go.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> How you doing there, Yard?
Good.<eos> So, I gotta go.<eos> Go where? Where you going?<eos> I'm going back home.<eos> You don't have to go anywhere.<eos> It's just the way it works.<eos> You shouldn't go anywhere you don't want to go.<eos> Who says I don't want to go?<eos> Why do you have to go?<eos> 'Cause I do.
- I Say Yes!<eos> - Core health and great shape...<eos> And... why is a magazine<eos> - As the Berlin New York...<eos> - As a fiddle and in top shape, makes his daily workout and drinks have become less as most alcoholics in this...<eos> Or rather:<eos> Most drink in this city more than the Chancellor.<eos> (Small laugh, cell phone rings)<eos> Excuse but I think I have to, uh...<eos> What did he do?
But... the summit.<eos> With or without summit, we're the highest of anyone.<eos> One could just claim to have been up there.<eos> Monsieur Bonpland, I'll pretend not to have heard that!<eos> Exploration, Aimé, is motion.<eos> By definition, it is motion that never ceases.<eos> There is no summit.<eos> And thus no reason to reach it.<eos> You see?<eos> - Yes, I do.
You didn't earn that mind.<eos> Sign it!<eos> It's nothing to be proud of.<eos> Pride is for those who earned it.<eos> Don't do me any favours.<eos> Don't talk to me about God. And I worked harder than you!<eos> I doubt that.<eos> - When I'd had enough, couldn't stand it anymore, found it too silly, I took curare. And God, of whom you like to speak, saved my life in what was doubtless one of His most idiotic miracles.<eos> I don't know why He did it.<eos> You don't?
- I...<eos> I did not mean to wake you.<eos> I woke you up, right?<eos> - I had my eyes open.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Sleeping isn't really my fortie.<eos> What were you thinking, with your eyes open?<eos> - If you'd call.<eos> - I did.
Matt, I know this has been hard, but it's the way the system works.<eos> Look, I'll talk to Whitford about Paris, but I can't promise anything.<eos> Look, I've got to go.<eos> Don't worry, I'm looking after you, okay?<eos> Yeah, I know, I know, I know.<eos> This is not a negotiation.<eos> It's 10 million.<eos> You'll get the file, and if the money is not in the account by 3:00 PM, I'll take it to another buyer.<eos> How do we know that you won't do that anyway?<eos> You don't.
I'll hook you up.<eos> Do you have those photos?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Wow.<eos> Yeah. Oh.<eos> We might need something a little more recent.<eos> Do you think?<eos> Do you have something that's a bit sexier?<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Did you...
I got it from here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The more I think about it the more the man makes sense, you know?<eos> And the more this makes sense for us.<eos> Don't be ridiculous!<eos> We're leaving, and we're taking Rachel with us.<eos> No no no.<eos> He's doing what he has to do, okay?<eos> He's doing what he has to do to keep the people that he loves alive.<eos> And the people he doesn't as their food!
That's the year we met!<eos> Yes!<eos> - On the set. - Yes!<eos> Gotta get back.<eos> We hadn't written to each other, hadn't called...<eos> Apart from the septic epistle.<eos> How did the reunion go?<eos> I didn't quite know what to expect.<eos> I didn't know...<eos> I just didn't.
We can't leave this place.<eos> The others will find their way.<eos> This is insane.<eos> I know. It is insane.<eos> I am so glad you're on the same page.<eos> I thought I was the one going crazy.<eos> Now I feel like you're the one going crazy, but I'm here to help you.<eos> I am not crazy.<eos> I'm not crazy either.<eos> Well, I don't...
A lot of people don't even get it.<eos> And I'm a single mother.<eos> You know?<eos> I'm a single mother, and I'm sitting here in a Britney Spears costume at a party with a son of yours that lives with you.<eos> So, yeah, I miss my husband.<eos> I miss him.<eos> What is that tea?<eos> It's so good.<eos> I suppose you want to get back to the kids.<eos> I do, actually.
What am I supposed to do with a puppy?<eos> We're going to have so much fun! You could take me on walks!<eos> You could throw sticks. I will retrieve them!<eos> You can rub my tummy!<eos> All off-topic.<eos> What I need you to do is marry me.<eos> Yes, I will. I will do that.<eos> I will marry you, because I love you.<eos> I love you to the edge of the four corners of the Earth. I love you to the edge of the Seven Seas.<eos> - Really? - I do!
I'd stop talking if I were you, we're letting you out.<eos> It's called a bribe.<eos> Anything new you want to tell us this morning, John'?<eos> I couldn't get laid by a prostitute, you know what that does to a man's ego?<eos> I can tell you something new this morning, Sheriff's. I'm listening.<eos> Will it get me out of here?<eos> Depends on what you tell us, sugar.<eos> The Chief's ancient Apache warrior mask was stolen by bunch of Elvis impersonators.<eos> And he knows where it is.<eos> I do not!
I know in the past I, I didn't understand and I'm not saying I understand now, but I'm here.<eos> Whenever you need me.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll always know.<eos> Bye.<eos> You love him, don't you?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Does Heidi Hawthorne live here?<eos> Do you perhaps mean Adelheid Elizabeth Hawthorne?<eos> Yes, as a matter of fact I do, yes.
Score a goal!<eos> Brother, brother.<eos> Hey, why did you do that to my brother?<eos> Zana, don't let them score.<eos> Zana, don't let them...<eos> Brother, don't worry.<eos> I'm not gonna let them score.<eos> Brother, I didn't let them score.<eos> I didn't let them.<eos> Well done, my brother
Ivan, hold her fast.<eos> I do not know where I am.<eos> I have to call my mom and dad.<eos> So it's up, the ladies!<eos> Come on, a row.<eos> Åh se that!<eos> Svetlana, came her.<eos> Take one.<eos> All.<eos> Do it.
Go find her.<eos> The tropical cyclone, which originated last week off the coast of British Honduras, has intensified rapidly and is now designated Hurricane Mabeline.<eos> Stay tuned for further information<eos> How can we help her?<eos> She's got so many problems.<eos> It's getting worse.<eos> Whose fault is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But just for the record 95 % of all runaways return home within the first six hours.<eos> That doesn't do you any good right now.
"...and the family of your King.<eos> "Do not divide on earth... "...what was united in heaven."<eos> I haven't written the rest.<eos> Good start though?<eos> Very good.<eos> You think they'll let him return?<eos> With all my heart.<eos> What an idiot I am to ask you.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> No one does.
So, what now?<eos> I mean, he's in, right?<eos> This was it.<eos> He was completely blown away.<eos> We don't have to live in that fucking garage anymore, no more scrounging for grant money!<eos> Remember when I first asked you out, I said,<eos> Trust me when they're going to pay off.<eos> Then you told me you had a boyfriend.<eos> I never said that. -Yeah, you did.<eos> No, I didn't!
Why don't we kill them?<eos> Come on, we'll kill two of them.<eos> I'll keep the best one.<eos> Really, it'll save us both a lot of trouble.<eos> Come on.<eos> Line up!<eos> Line up for murder!<eos> Come on!<eos> Who wants to be killed?<eos> I do!
- Take that, man.<eos> Take that.<eos> - Bruv...<eos> - It's cool, man.<eos> - You want this mess sorted out, yeah?<eos> - Yeah. Well, I was speaking to Vince...<eos> - She's lovely!<eos> - And Carol can't have kids.<eos> That's a kid whose mother doesn't want it, bruv.<eos> She does, man.
You gotta, like, give a girl some warning or something when you do that.<eos> I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> I should have.<eos> I just--<eos> It's just that I've been thinking.<eos> I don't know much about relationships.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> I definitely don't know anything about love.<eos> I can't believe I talked like I did.<eos> I don't.
Christ.<eos> Did you kill him?<eos> - Did you fucking kill him?<eos> - Calm down.<eos> No.<eos> Were you going to?<eos> Were you going to?<eos> Kevin knows.<eos> He's red-lighted me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
More champagne!<eos> There's mud water in the glass.<eos> How did it get in there?<eos> -I can't tell. Lauri, pass me the knife.<eos> I need to answer this.<eos> Finally the day of the ball came.<eos> The slepsislers left for the castle, and Cinderella felt so very sad.<eos> When they had gone, she burst into tears.<eos> Why can't the prince find Cinderella?<eos> He does, in the end.
He was a fucking walrus.<eos> You can 'I get dressed here, faggot!<eos> Get the hell out of here!<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> You didn't hear me?<eos> Just go into the corridor<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You still want to spit?<eos> Do you?
It was her.<eos> NOBEL HEAD shot<eos> It was her, I had to supervise.<eos> Caroline von Behring.<eos> Is he trustworthy? - Yes.<eos> Have you read the newspapers today? Writes about Aaron Wiesel and controversial stem cell research.<eos> I know.<eos> And you think they are wrong?<eos> And you believe him?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I thought we were going further.<eos> We are. 18 miles out.<eos> So why are we stopping?<eos> I wanted to talk.<eos> Been waiting a week till we were gonna do this.<eos> I just wanna talk.<eos> - We don't need to.<eos> - We do.<eos> No, man, we don't.
I mean, we've lost others.<eos> This is Sophia.<eos> The whole group...<eos> This one was different.<eos> So what happens now?<eos> We bury her with your stepmom and your stepbrother.<eos> And then?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - lthought I'd find her.<eos> - We all did.
Right, Rick?<eos> We're just friends having a drink. That's all.<eos> Now where's the good stuff, huh?<eos> Good stuff, good stuff, good stuff.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Hey, look at that.<eos> That'll work.<eos> You gotta understand, we can't stay out there.<eos> - You know what it's like.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Without my permission.<eos> Then you will be telling the traffic police...<eos> About the traffic from the control room, understand.<eos> - No, sir, actually...<eos> - Did I ask you?<eos> Will you work for the traffic control?<eos> Do you want to work for the traffic control?<eos> Out.<eos> Who else?<eos> Do you?
Not embryos - fully grown mice.<eos> He scooped you on the mammals, I'm sorry he did it, but I don't know how.<eos> What?<eos> I'm the proof.<eos> You know what, you're right.<eos> Screw the test!<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Where's Jarek?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes you do!
Now!<eos> There's another convict escaped from the Hulks.<eos> What might he have done, the convict?<eos> Murder most likely.<eos> That's why they put them in the Hulks, because they murder.<eos> - Murder?<eos> - Murder and robbing. That's too many questions!<eos> Where's that bread gone?<eos> I ate it.<eos> You did, did you?
Got some free shit!<eos> Take it easy, Van Damme!<eos> Hadji at the front desk said we're only a few hours from Austin.<eos> Nice!<eos> - Who that?<eos> - Fuck.<eos> Who do you think?<eos> Don't answer that shit, man!<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> Don't you...
You want to make a fiver?<eos> What do I have to do for it?<eos> Get a gym bag out of locker 130.<eos> Why don' you get it?<eos> Hey, hey... Get the bag first.<eos> 130.<eos> Hey!<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Who gave you the fucking locker number?<eos> No one did!
I wanted to ask you something.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Don't get angry.<eos> It's kind of crazy.<eos> I love crazy.<eos> I'm insane.<eos> I want to write.<eos> I want to tell your story.<eos> - You want to write my story?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
She disobeys him in some way.<eos> So he puts her on top of the mountain.<eos> Broomhilda's on a mountain?<eos> It's a German legend, there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere.<eos> And he puts a fire-breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.<eos> And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire.<eos> And there, Broomhilda shall remain.<eos> Unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.<eos> Does a fella arise?<eos> Yes, Django, as a matter of fact, he does.
So I'm coming back to try to see her naked again.<eos> I'd be weirded out if some guy tried to track me down after 20 years.<eos> I'd be weirded out too if some guy tried to track you down. Why?<eos> Who would do that?<eos> Tomorrow morning, I'll go in.<eos> You know, go undercover, pretend to answer his ad and get the scoop on this yo-yo.<eos> 991 Mallory.<eos> This is definitely it. What a piece of shit.<eos> AII right, I'm goin' in.<eos> How do I Iook, Arnau?
I know what I'm doing, okay?<eos> Flip that switch. Do it.<eos> Flip it down.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> to go it alone or to go with a partner.<eos> When you choose a partner, you have to have compromises and sacrifices, but it's the price you pay.<eos> Do I wanna follow my every whim and desire as I make my way through time and space? Absolutely.<eos> But at the end of the day, do I need someone when I'm doubting myself, and I'm insecure and my heart's failing me?<eos> Do I need someone who, when the heat gets hot, has my back?<eos> - So, do you? - I do.
Handwritten, I mean, like with a pen or something.<eos> Yeah, paper. Maybe seal it with some red wax.<eos> I could listen to this while I'm writing.<eos> Right, it'll be like full-on 17th century.<eos> Right, right.<eos> So I don't have your address.<eos> Oh, 108 is my P.O. Box, and you can figure out the rest, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I also... I put my number on the inside of the case.<eos> Yes, you did.
- Oh, that's good.<eos> That's special.<eos> Yeah, he can also... he does a thing, like a sit-up.<eos> Kaspar, can you show her the thing?<eos> Watch it.<eos> Like a sit-up, but crusted and a little more...<eos> Something special.<eos> He can do this thing where he bangs his head right against the wall, and he doesn't get hurt.<eos> Watch this. - Oh my God!<eos> Kaspar, do the 'Headbanger'.
- You understand? - Um, yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> Turn your car around.<eos> Now, please.<eos> Hey, Dolph.<eos> Why do you keep coming here?<eos> Why wouldn't I?<eos> I like this job.<eos> - Is that a problem?<eos> - No, no. We... We all do.
That's great.<eos> That's exactly what I would have done.<eos> - I'm proud of you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> They'll probably use it for Christmas.<eos> I hope so.<eos> By the way, before I forget, you have to meet Master Chang at his office between 2:00 and 3:00.<eos> It's very important.<eos> But how do you know Master Chang?<eos> I don't.
Wait!<eos> What a bunch of crazies.<eos> - This is not funny!<eos> Undead creature?<eos> Humanoid-looking. Yeah.<eos> Probably drooling... and eating somebody's...<eos> Eating somebody's brains.<eos> Brains?<eos> I want brai- Mm-mmm.<eos> No I don't! No I don't!
I just think I'm worried about this whole addict thing, you know?<eos> I mean, I just...<eos> Do you ever worry that you'll be just humming along, and then he's just gonna veer off back into the darkness?<eos> In my experience, the only way that I can do this is just to keep the focus on myself.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Meaning... What about my side of the street?<eos> What are my issues that I have to deal with?<eos> After all, I picked an addict, that says something.<eos> Yeah, so, I mean, it's pretty much self-sustaining, you know?<eos> The fish, they do their thing in the water, and that...
Hi. I did the icing but it's from her... 'cause she's sorry she got mad at you.<eos> Cake!<eos> I told her that you like chocolate.<eos> I do like chocolate.<eos> Thank you. Thank you both.<eos> Uh, you guys hungry? Yeah?<eos> I know someone who works here ... so I might be able to get you a table.<eos> You work here.<eos> Yeah, I guess you're right.<eos> I do work here.
If I describe her, you can tell me if she or someone linked to her left the phone.<eos> You just said your wife was dead.<eos> I know, but...<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> Don't drag me into your problems.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> My wife may be alive.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> See if the screen says "redirect".<eos> Yes, it does.
You slimy little limey.<eos> I do not respond well to threats, and neither does Cyrus Rose.<eos> He fought in 'Nam.<eos> You didn't let me finish.<eos> His plan might not work, but mine can.<eos> We can help each other, you and I.<eos> Go on.<eos> You don't want Louis.<eos> That's clear.<eos> But I do.
- Sir, the safe, now, please.<eos> - I don't know the code.<eos> We've been listening, she said she told you.<eos> Well if you've been listening, you'll know she didn't.<eos> I'm assuming I missed something.<eos> From your reputation, I'm assuming you didn't, Mr Holmes.<eos> For God's sake, she's the one who knows the code, ask her!<eos> Yes, sir, she also knows the code that automatically calls the police and sets off the burglar alarm.<eos> - I've learned not to trust this woman.<eos> - Mr Holmes doesn't...
$17 for meat loaf?<eos> Well, isn't this fancy?<eos> - It's good. It's worth it.<eos> - Thanks for dinner, Angel.<eos> - It's no big deal.<eos> - Sorry about your boyfriend.<eos> - He has a name...<eos> - Yeah, we all do.<eos> - And you know it.<eos> - We all do.
-For a legitimate ride.<eos> -Legitimate.<eos> -A ticket represents a contract.<eos> -I'd love to have one, but I don't.<eos> Use of a transportation system without a valid ticket.<eos> -Is 40 euros.<eos> Your information, please.<eos> -That costs 40 euros.<eos> Why do you repeat everything?<eos> -I don't.
- Yeah,well,you know...<eos> - She can't write not fuckin' lyrics,yo.<eos> Just a pretty face and a fuckin' smile.<eos> All right,all right,all right.<eos> Well,how can I help?<eos> Help the girl write some fuckin' lyrics,man.<eos> Oh,no,no. I write books...<eos> screenplays,emails,uh--<eos> - Nigga,writin' is writing',man.<eos> - l don't.
He's you.<eos> What are you talking about? The kid's a loathsome, fucking asshole.<eos> I'd like to introduce you to Richard Bates.<eos> Haven't touched the stuff since Slick Willy was in the White House.<eos> Come on up, honey.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Tyler switched drinks, thought it would be funny to watch him get drunk.<eos> Jesus, that kid really is a young me.<eos> You want me to go after him?<eos> No, I don't.
Oh, shit!<eos> This way.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Bates!<eos> You snuck out on me, you tricky little dicky, you!<eos> She knows my name, Hank.<eos> Yes, indeed, she does.
By the way, I invited daddy.<eos> Why on earth would you do that?<eos> Because I asked him to be a godparent.<eos> Your father?<eos> Does he even know you have children?<eos> He said he would.<eos> Well, he said he'd be at your wedding.<eos> He lies.<eos> Whatever makes you think he'll change?<eos> You did.
It's...<eos> Hey, man, what's up?<eos> I'm Jesse.<eos> I'm Luke.<eos> You're late.<eos> Hey.<eos> I know you.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> - He doesn't.
Her?<eos> My wife.<eos> - Your wife?<eos> - Who's your wife?<eos> - Mary.<eos> - Don't know her.<eos> - That why you killed the receptionist?<eos> - Kill?<eos> - Yeah, you heard what she said. "Kill."<eos> - But I didn't.
Are you stone?<eos> I wept them all out for him long ago.<eos> Over and over, I watched him fail, and I wept.<eos> You should know: you were there.<eos> And still you granted him your every favour.<eos> Take yourselves- both- away from our sight!<eos> Clean him up.<eos> Bring him back to life as if he were our own Lord Jesus Christ.<eos> Yes,Eminence.<eos> Do your work.
- ... after you brought them all back.<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> I did not wanna get into this with you.<eos> You had no right to get rid of all this without consulting me.<eos> She is your mother, but she was my wife.<eos> Why do you wanna keep it all here anyway?<eos> Listen, Daddy, I am sorry, but she is not coming back.<eos> Not ever.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Not the demon.<eos> Jeffrey!<eos> Jeffrey?<eos> Good.<eos> You're up.<eos> What happened?<eos> What's going on?<eos> No one asked you to get involved, to save me, to save anyone.<eos> What? Did you ever think that maybe I loved being possessed?<eos> Did you?
Dude.<eos> All right, Sam.<eos> Tap the keg.<eos> Here?<eos> Yeah, Sam, look around.<eos> It's friggin' Woodstock. Everybody's hopped up on the brown acid.<eos> We don't need the song and dance. Give him a little prick.<eos> This is for Hurricane Katrina, you said?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
- I mean over here.<eos> Sorry, I forgot where I was.<eos> Buongiorno, Bender.<eos> We, the robot mafia, are prepared to lend you $10,000 at an interest rate of 10,000%.<eos> That's easy to remember.<eos> I'll take it!<eos> Decisions, decisions.<eos> I guess I'll sit way in back, with the cool guys.<eos> Yo hombre, you think you're cool enough to sit way in back with us college toughs?<eos> Yes, I do.
No, it's me, Jack!<eos> Can you open the door from the inside?<eos> I tried it.<eos> Something wrong with S.A.R.A.H.<eos> Okay, just hang tight, okay, pal?<eos> Okay, I'm gonna turn off the rest of the lights.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You can't get in?<eos> S.A.R.A.H.'s on lockdown. Did you try overriding the circuits?<eos> - Did...
Schizophrenia, of course, or a brain tumor, or a cocaine addiction, or a temporal focal epilepsy.<eos> - Yeah, it's... unlikely...<eos> - It's a long shot.<eos> Or it could be an infection of some kind.<eos> Malaria or lupus could cause delusions. True.<eos> Or I could just be dreaming.<eos> I could be in some awesome NREM dream cycle.<eos> We're gonna get you to talk to Allison. Okay?<eos> Allison. Allison saw the dragon disappear.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Zane found other Z - wave signatures in the mainframe where Holly was being stored.<eos> What if that's why she started bio-printing more bodies?<eos> But, why would she create new bodies for them?<eos> Maybe because the program told her to.<eos> There was a deliberate energy pulse in the lab.<eos> What if it was a command that her neural processor was responding to?<eos> So, you really think others are controlling Holly?<eos> Zane and I saw something.<eos> Hands, like someone was trying to get out.<eos> What if they did?
But we have to connect it to the Smart Dust control unit to amplify the pulse.<eos> I bet the clone army's using it to power the new Matrix computer.<eos> Yeah, except we don't have the Z-bomb.<eos> That does pose an issue.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Zane said the Z-bomb fit in his pocket.<eos> So, if he and Parrish were taken, maybe he could still have it.<eos> So, we just need to find out where they're being held and activate it.<eos> Except we have no clue where that is.<eos> But someone does.
Vodka pom, right?<eos> Winston said it was a tradish. Look, Benjamin's smiling.<eos> Jess, you did so good.<eos> Is this stripper pole weight-bearing?<eos> Looks like some pretty shoddy workmanship on the cap flange.<eos> Hi, I'm Jessica Day.<eos> I spoke with your supervisor on the telephone.<eos> Um, are you bringing the stripper?<eos> 'Cause I really wanted to see her jugs first, you know, just so...<eos> um, I do right by my bro.
- Okay.<eos> That'll do it.<eos> Hey, Jess.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute alone?<eos> So, what's up?<eos> Ready to admit you were wrong?<eos> Hello.<eos> My name is Nick, and I like eating crow.<eos> - That man wants to sleep with you.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
I look amazing?<eos> Amazing to see you, silly!<eos> Rafa! Maribel!<eos> Look who's here!<eos> Maribel and Rafa.<eos> I couldn't wait to see you.<eos> - How are you, gorgeous?<eos> - Let me look at you.<eos> You look fabulous.<eos> So do you.
- It's his account.<eos> - So I guess I'm not in charge of everything.<eos> Jesus, Peggy, you know what?<eos> You want to go to Paris?<eos> Here. Go to Paris.<eos> - I'm not crying.<eos> - I didn't think that.<eos> What, we're all suddenly interested in each other's lives?<eos> I know for a fact that Jaguar's not going to happen.<eos> And he probably does, too.
I just want an audition.<eos> I'll be Megan Calvet.<eos> Ken, Stan and Ginsberg are gonna be there.<eos> They know who you are.<eos> - I'm gonna call the dentist.<eos> - No. I'm better.<eos> Listen, just forget I brought any of this up.<eos> It's just--<eos> It's been so hard, you know.<eos> I do.
Just some small-time pricks that think they can come and run things.<eos> You showed 'em, though.<eos> Shit.<eos> Fighter!<eos> Shut up.<eos> You gonna make me?<eos> Maybe...<eos> I have to go.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
I haven't seen a spring with this much rain ever.<eos> That's funny, I got more berries than I can handle.<eos> So you know anybody who's looking for work picking... you send them my way.<eos> Well, aren't you a smug bastard.<eos> What if I was ten minutes later?<eos> Goodness, Craig, what did you do to our kitchen?<eos> I didn't do anything to the kitchen.<eos> You left an oven mitt on the stove.<eos> Oh, don't be ridiculous.<eos> - I didn't.
- I'm going to put a big window right here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And, um, there'll be another one against that wall. And one or two more small ones along the back.<eos> All right.<eos> You don't happen to have the dimensions of any of these windows, do you, Gramp?<eos> - Not for the big one, no.<eos> - No?<eos> I'm not sure whether I'm going to go with a bay or not.<eos> I suppose I could commit to where they're going right now, - I mean, if we really need to.<eos> - Yeah, we really do.
You think I'm not aware of that?<eos> - That's why I'm building the house.<eos> - But a house isn't going to fix it.<eos> No, but it will make everything a lot more manageable.<eos> I've been looking into some programs that I think would be good for her.<eos> No!<eos> It's not what your mother would want.<eos> You haven't even heard what I have to say!<eos> Besides, I'm not so sure she even knows what she wants anymore.<eos> Yes, she does.
I realize you and I sort of got off on the wrong foot... but, uh... this doesn't have to get personal.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I... I didn't mean any disrespect.<eos> You have certain... violations against your house.<eos> Could you please tell me what to do and I'll do it.<eos> Mr. Morrison, this office does not have the resources to spend to teach people the fundamentals of how to build.<eos> They either know how to do it or they hire someone who does.<eos> You've seen my report.<eos> You know what needs to be done.<eos> Yes, I do.
We found your father.<eos> We know he's dead.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> He was...<eos> But he's not.<eos> You think he's dead, but... He's everywhere.<eos> No matter how many times you kill him, he's everywhere.<eos> Do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Oh, no, you don't.
- How are you?<eos> - Well. You?<eos> - Good.<eos> Natalie said she spoke to you.<eos> Have you come for a reference? To check her out?<eos> Not quite, no.<eos> I don't wanna put a curse on it, but I have a feeling about it, you and Natalie.<eos> I think it could be good for you.<eos> - Am I allowed to say this?<eos> - You just did.
That's what you want to ask me?<eos> Should've known. He's always been your favorite.<eos> That is not true, Fiona.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> You're your favorite.<eos> Bob throw you out, or you walk out on her, too?<eos> Your father came to me.<eos> He needed me. Told me you needed me, too.<eos> He lied.<eos> We don't.
Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.<eos> What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?<eos> After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host.<eos> Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, - feeding horses and soldiers.<eos> - Yes, yes, yes.<eos> The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings.<eos> Loras wants revenge.<eos> He blames Stannis for Renly's death.<eos> And Margaery... Wants to be queen.<eos> Yes, she does.
- Outside, waiting for me. And when was the last time you ate?<eos> - Last night.<eos> - What about this morning?<eos> I ate a lot last night.<eos> A Detective took me out for dinner, and I had a steak and some fries.<eos> A Detective took you to dinner?<eos> Me and my brother.<eos> He's trying to find out what happened to Steven and Kevin.<eos> I know you probably don't remember them, but... Anyway, Steven's dead now, so he's trying to find out, uh, if we know anyone else who got jobs.<eos> Well, do you?
He came to us three years ago during one of our winter nights for the homeless.<eos> - Hung on a lot longer than any of us expected. Saints be praised.<eos> No, that wasn't what I...<eos> Weust can't afford to keep him any longer. - Oh.<eos> - State cutbacks.<eos> You'll receive $50 a day for food and whatever else he needs, but let's just say,<eos> I'm not going to be making any surprise visits.<eos> Father, I've...<eos> I've... done a terrible thing.<eos> I don't...
It's like bringing a joint to a crack house.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Gonna fucking waste - your Peter Pan ass.<eos> - Put it down.<eos> What the fuck you doing?<eos> - Let him go.<eos> - The little shit broke in.<eos> - Wait, he's not the dad.<eos> - He knows.<eos> The fuck I do.
Sorry, but for more than two hours we try to talk to you.<eos> I'm sorry, but you need the lady in the kitchen.<eos> A plane will depart tomorrow morning to catch the President...<eos> How?<eos> A plane will depart tomorrow morning...<eos> To catch the President in Tunisia. Need preparing food for the twelve personalities that will be part of the entourage.<eos> We will receive confirmation of flight soon at night.<eos> Where do you got?<eos> For more than two hours that are behind you.<eos> What time does the plane?
The police are after me.<eos> What should I do?<eos> - Where is your gun?<eos> In the car.<eos> Are you logged in?<eos> Moment, we'll make.<eos> How much are the potatoes?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why did you shoot your wife?<eos> I do not movies.
She also said the adventure was over for us. Bitch!<eos> It's not American Idol.<eos> She's no bitch.<eos> You don't know her, so shut up.<eos> You cheated on her? No.<eos> 5 years with me.<eos> She bounced.<eos> I'd have done the same.<eos> Are you nuts? Don't talk like that.<eos> A real man doesn't.
Everyone, grab an ax.<eos> It'll give you your dwarf name.<eos> The ax never lies, Dreamy.<eos> Okay, folks, grab a lantern and move out.<eos> Today is the first day of the rest of your lives.<eos> Welcome to the mines!<eos> Where can I sign up?<eos> What?<eos> I want to volunteer to sell candles.<eos> No, you don't.
I can't.<eos> No!<eos> What's happening to you?<eos> You can see it now.<eos> You believe.<eos> Yeah, I do, but how do we stop this?<eos> Break the curse.<eos> I'll try, I promise.<eos> But I got to save Henry first, and I need your help.<eos> No, you don't.
That's great.<eos> So a deal's a deal.<eos> Uh-uh, too late.<eos> Spilt milk.<eos> I passed, you go back to school.<eos> - All water under the bridge.<eos> - Knock off the cliches.<eos> Road not taken.<eos> I want you home, Lip.<eos> We all do.
I don't need another year of crappy public high school education. Here's the way life works.<eos> Mmm...<eos> You suck it up, you do your work, you get your diploma, and that little piece of paper tells every other person who wanted to quit high school, that you can follow through and finish something.<eos> You don't have yours, and you're doing fine.<eos> I'm going to stab you in the chest.<eos> You're graduating.<eos> I didn't and I still regret it.<eos> Who's stopping you?<eos> Debbie, Carl, Liam, you.<eos> Hey, don't do me any favors.
- Uh-huh, she is coming too.<eos> That's good, then she can watch out for us.<eos> What's your favorite dish?<eos> Probably venison.<eos> My favorite is fish fingers.<eos> Why do you work in our kindergarten?<eos> Well, that's because I was a teacher at your big brother's old school.<eos> And then it closed. - Do you remember that? - Uh-huh.<eos> My dad says that you are sad because you live in a big house all alone.<eos> - Well, does he now?
Why?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> She scares you, doesn't she?<eos> She scares you to death.<eos> You let me look around, and I won't tell Sister Horrible about your nighttime forays. Or your secret tunnel.<eos> Hello, Mr. Walker.<eos> I'm Dr. Arthur Arden.<eos> I run this institution.<eos> - I thought Sister Jude ran this place.<eos> - So does she.
Thank you.<eos> I don't think we've met.<eos> Mike Cruz.<eos> Oh, my God, where are my manners?<eos> Dick Babbit from cardiology.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Likewise.<eos> I'll leave you two to get him upstairs.<eos> And, Dick, you need an ID badge.<eos> Whoa, indeed I do.
- My help?<eos> - Who the hell is this?<eos> - Hi, I'm Adam.<eos> - Just go do what you came here to do.<eos> lam asking both of you for your forgiveness.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> We done now?<eos> Do you forgive me?<eos> I want to.<eos> I really do.
Yes, it did.<eos> Okay.<eos> Stupid computer.<eos> Mom, I don't want to babysit.<eos> Honey, you're overreacting.<eos> We're only gonna be gone for a few hours.<eos> I don't want to be alone in this house!<eos> You bitch!<eos> -What'd you say?<eos> -What did they...
I tell you that already?<eos> Twice.<eos> I guess I'm getting old. It seems like yesterday I was partying till dawn down in Miami.<eos> Used to own six nightclubs down there.<eos> Mansion in Coral Gables, a white Bengal tiger.<eos> I had to give all that up.<eos> Bad for my health.<eos> What about you?<eos> Where you from?<eos> What do you do?
Kidney.<eos> How long did they give you?<eos> "How long"?<eos> I'm a dead man. That's how long.<eos> Having trouble sleeping, I expect.<eos> Yes. Why?<eos> Well, I can tell you how to get to sleep if you tell us who you think killed your son.<eos> Who says I know?<eos> Well, you said you were wasting your time with us, so I assumed you already knew who was responsible.<eos> Do you, Mr. Porchetto?
Is Drew coming?<eos> Let's get Dennis his croc DNA so we can make us some money.<eos> Camp all set up?<eos> Yeah, just like you said.<eos> This way.<eos> How about the boat?<eos> Ready to go.<eos> Now, look, we need you all to just calm down.<eos> See, we-we-we all want the same thing.<eos> No, we don't.
I'm sorry. Have a good night.<eos> This is the sheriff.<eos> Hey.<eos> Heart of Darkness?<eos> It's a great book.<eos> I mean, so I hear.<eos> I just started it.<eos> Who reads?<eos> Elaine says you might come with us.<eos> She did?
He filled out all the forms.<eos> All you had to do was go meet with my principal.<eos> I will meet with your principal. When?<eos> Today?<eos> Look, Grace, I know things take a little bit longer 'cause your dad and I are not in the same house. (SCOFFS)<eos> I promise you, I will take care of it.<eos> You don't know what it's like to have to go to a place that you hate every day.<eos> As a matter of fact, Grace, yes, I do.<eos> Do you think I want to go to work?<eos> No, I don't.
You know where he is.<eos> You want things to be different, you handle it.<eos> Like you're me.<eos> I think I was too honest.<eos> And I think I wasn't honest enough.<eos> These Quantum Bay guys, they know what they're doing.<eos> I've never seen a cute girl in HR.<eos> Then all of a sudden, I'm at my exit interview, I'm talking to Jessica fucking Rabbit.<eos> You want to look at your severance check?<eos> Do you?
In a lake or a pond or an everglade?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's a canal near my mother's house.<eos> Do you know what's wrong with her?<eos> Family vacations kill.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Don't want to explain this twice.<eos> You're letting in the flies.<eos> And she needs an LVAD.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Treat with steroids.<eos> Then come right back here, 'cause I'm not gonna rest until I've made orphans of all your virtual children.<eos> House never loses. Seriously?<eos> Me beating House is medically significant?<eos> It could be.<eos> Reduced fine motor control.<eos> Add that to inattention and liver flap.<eos> It does make sense.<eos> We have to talk to Foreman.<eos> No, we don't.
Well, yeah, it worries me.<eos> But he's a grown man, - he can take care of himself.<eos> - What about his mother?<eos> She died about four years ago.<eos> I'm the only family Dimitri has.<eos> Look, he's a good kid.<eos> He did some drugs a while back, but he's straightened out.<eos> He couldn't kill anybody.<eos> Anybody else in here know him?<eos> Well, most of the guys do.
I think your tattoo may have given you lead poisoning.<eos> Stop, stop, stop.<eos> Bad idea.<eos> We're gonna get found out. We're gonna get ourselves killed.<eos> Lemon, you've watched too many Patrick Swayze movies.<eos> You said you didn't wanna be Lemon for a night.<eos> Well, this is your chance.<eos> Lemon, we're in Fairhope.<eos> Nobody knows who you are.<eos> They don't?
He's gonna need to be on blood thinners from now on-<eos> - But he's going to be okay?<eos> He's going to be okay.<eos> Oh, Dr. Hart. Thank you so much. Thank you.<eos> No worries.<eos> - Dr. Hart, I don't know what to say.<eos> You are an angel sent from heaven.<eos> - In one little package.<eos> - I didn't do anything.<eos> Yes, you did. You did everything.
Maybe you're jealous.<eos> This is a job of trust, and I can't have a partner I can't trust.<eos> I don't know how to act, I don't know what to do, - I don't know who to hire.<eos> - Deb, you're too smart to think that this was gonna be easy.<eos> Do you really think that Matthews made you lieutenant because you were ready?<eos> It's all politics to get back at me.<eos> Every time the shit hits the fan, I go to him.<eos> He's your safe place.<eos> You're making it sound like I wanna be with him or something.<eos> Well, do you?
What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Calm down.<eos> It's just a trick that I learned at dad's bar.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, unlearn it.<eos> Somebody in the E.R. just got 22 stitches from trying to open a bottle with a lighter.<eos> - It's really dangerous.<eos> - They must've done it wrong.<eos> You need one of these bad boys.<eos> - No, she does not.

How do you know that, living in Colorado ?<eos> Let me know if you want to talk about the two hundred fifty billion dollar in bail out. That didn't do anyone any good.<eos> I got some thoughts on that one, too.<eos> Oh, I'm sure you do.<eos> How about we talk about this militia camp ?<eos> Like why you even think it's there to begin with ? And why you think bin Laden might be there ?<eos> I took this off of a guy that obviously can't read anymore.<eos> - No question that this is Intel on the militia camp.<eos> But who's there is anyone's guess. Even we're guessing.<eos> You guys do that a lot.
Okay, I know it sounds like that...<eos> It's like he brainwashed you or something.<eos> Or Bay did.<eos> I tried to keep it simple because I thought it would be better for you, and now I see it might have been a mistake.<eos> Oh, and suddenly he is this great guy and you're gonna go dancing with him.<eos> - It's not like that.<eos> - I don't want you to see him!<eos> Why can't you just tell Bay no?<eos> - You know why.<eos> - No, I don't.
Carolyn?<eos> Mr. Bynes, is everything all right?<eos> Well, Mrs. Bynes isn't picking up, I thought I'd check on her.<eos> So did her daughter.
Sure, they do. They are Jenna's favorites.<eos> I guess I know our daughter a little better than you do.<eos> My mom thought she could work her way back into my heart through my stomach.<eos> She didn't know me at all.<eos> What's going on here? You're cooking, and you're not eating.<eos> My Matty secret wasn't the only one I was keeping.<eos> My mom and I were still harboring her secret that she wrote the letter, and I figured she should be the one to bust it out.<eos> Mom, do you want to tell him?<eos> Why not?<eos> Lacey, what the hell did you do?
What did you ju--<eos> Oh my God, I can't believe you ju--<eos> You did it.<eos> I'm free.<eos> That was amazing!<eos> I know.<eos> And who said having you around was a bad idea?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I don't know, Tucker.<eos> Who did?
Right, now, I'm gonna give you three guesses.<eos> Who am I?<eos> Ho-way! Y'all right?<eos> Oh, look at the state of that.<eos> I've got a lovely soft fanny.<eos> It's all soft and furry.<eos> Look at me little furry Virginia.<eos> Oh, it's like a little squirrel's gone in there.<eos> Give it a stroke. I want it to become my friend.<eos> I don't...
Miss Fisher's ward, it says.<eos> Jane Ross.<eos> Yes. Jane's been with me for quite some time now.<eos> I thank you so very much for keeping my little girl safe and healthy.<eos> It's been my absolute pleasure.<eos> Miss Fisher?<eos> That's me.<eos> I don't understand, Miss.<eos> I thought Jane's mother was dead.<eos> We all did, Dot.
Well, they have every reason to lie, but...<eos> I must say that I'm intrigued.<eos> Russell wants nothing more than anarchy.<eos> If you would like your entire mainstreaming agenda, and your administration with it, to be completely obliterated, then by all means ignore me.<eos> The only thing Russell wants more is to see us dead.<eos> Why?<eos> He pissed me off.<eos> Then I pissed him off.<eos> You know how these things go.<eos> No, I don't.
You're not to move until I come for you.<eos> - Understood?<eos> - I need my bag.<eos> We'll discuss that later.<eos> Go on.<eos> I don't mean to be melodramatic.<eos> I was getting ready to go back to Philadelphia for the week and I just wanted to be sure...<eos> Well, oily rags and all that.<eos> I found him in my garage.<eos> - Doing what?
I'll build ...<eos> I build on God!<eos> Yes, that's good.<eos> That's good, that's good, that's good.<eos> Force! The power and the glory.<eos> Loui ?<eos> I'm going to bring Bavaria to bloom.<eos> I'm going to go this way to get my Bro ..<eos> Go<eos> How does a king?
Its unersttlicherAppetit ... Can only be compared with biblical Heuschreckenschwrmen .<eos> This is malos berschtzende man once at the top of a band of incendiaries ... Wanted to blow the Knigspalast in Dresden in the air now intends to isolate the king and Bavaria to throw in Preuens claws.<eos> If the ek lhatt!<eos> For months, I suggest you alternative minister before.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Now finally tell you what!<eos> How many times have we errtert?<eos> Now get out!<eos> It's that simple!<eos> Yes, only do so on.
Oh...<eos> I cannot believe you laughed!<eos> I am sorry.<eos> But you know I have two weaknesses-- children cursing and old people rapping.<eos> Cam, we have to tell her it's a bad word.<eos> No.<eos> That just gives it more power.<eos> The less we make of it, the better.<eos> Let's just pretend like it never happened. Okay.<eos> Yeah, maybe it-- maybe it didn't.
Now, there's a handful. That little sumbitch? He's gonna grow up to be just like his daddy.<eos> Join ASGuard. Be a man someday.<eos> Of course, he's got some pretty big britches to fill... So to speak.<eos> That boy has got a bright future ahead of him.<eos> You, on the other hand...<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're here to ask how I'm doing?<eos> I'd ask.<eos> But you already know the answer to that question.<eos> Yeah, I do.
She was the only good thing I had in my life till Division made me who I am.<eos> I'm not gonna let Percy hurt her.<eos> - Nikita, you know this is a trap.<eos> - What choice do I have?<eos> He says he's gonna go after her, he's gonna go after her.<eos> He's using you to get her into the open.<eos> What if he's already onto Carla and he's--<eos> Waiting for us when we get there?<eos> I hope he is, Michael.<eos> I really, really do.
Just puke already.<eos> Oh, that's a good-looking lymph node.<eos> You got it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oop.<eos> Did-did he say "Oops"?<eos> Dr. Bailey.<eos> What a pleasant surprise.<eos> - The man said "Oops."<eos> - I didn't.
- The man said "Oops."<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Actually, Dr. Bailey, I just said "Oop."<eos> He was picking up a lymph node, almost dropped it, but didn't.<eos> Let's make some room so Dr. Bailey can get a better view of our every move.<eos> As you were, Avery.<eos> Y... you-you don't want a little more suction, Avery?<eos> Dr. Bailey, while I'm always glad to hear your perspective, I'll instruct the resident.<eos> But your instructions result in oops.<eos> We don't oops in my O.R.
Treasury called this morning.<eos> Another one popped.<eos> - Where?<eos> - El Paso.<eos> El Paso.<eos> Well, has anyone talked to Charlie, ask him to take a second look?<eos> No. Charlie went home sick Tuesday, and I haven't been able to get in touch with him.<eos> Well, I saw Charlie Tuesday.<eos> He seemed fine.<eos> Did he, now?
Right next to the giant bong. Uh...<eos> We were always so good at that.<eos> Oh yeah, but not much else.<eos> Well, hopefully that will change.<eos> Do you remember that hotel in Cocoa Beach?<eos> That was awful!<eos> It rained the whole time.<eos> Well, staying indoors has its benefits.<eos> Those maids kept asking us if we needed turn-down service.<eos> - Strange we never did...
Thank you!<eos> Oh, I'll get it.<eos> Go sports!<eos> Hello-lo-lo.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I thought you were out th Sheldon and Amy.<eos> I was, but it's their anniversary and I didn't want to be a third wheel, so I figured I'd come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.<eos> Well, it's not really a great time.<eos> Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.<eos> No, we don't!
Yes!<eos> That's exactly what I'm gonna do.<eos> Who here is gonna understand glowing spikes?<eos> Half of these people still think I killed Jimmy.<eos> You can rat me out if you want, but I am not signing my own death warrant.<eos> And I am your brother. And all I'm trying to do is help.<eos> I know.<eos> But you need to back off.<eos> You want to see me, boss?<eos> Yes, I did.
I know, this ruling doesn't make any sense.<eos> No, I meant this.<eos> - The hot dog is wrong?<eos> - It's a truck.<eos> This is New York.<eos> I want a cart, a vendor, or a vague sense of danger, that the hot dog might be made of anything.<eos> Okay, well, I think I saw some cats lurking out behind the truck.<eos> Stop trying to make me feel better.<eos> All right, street meat, you wanna talk about what just happened?<eos> No, I don't.
I have access to all the museum cameras from here.<eos> They had to make the uniform out of polyester, didn't they?<eos> And Diana will go under as a docent.<eos> Don't you think it's more plausible if you and Diana were the patrons?<eos> I mean, a happy couple visiting the museum.<eos> She thinks Warhol's cool.<eos> You think, "A can of soup's a can of soup."<eos> You want to be the docent.<eos> Listen, if you guys think that's best, I'm happy --<eos> We don't.
- The Bureau takes care of you.<eos> Everybody that we work on is fully covered.<eos> It's in the regs.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can use me.<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> I'm sorry, what's your name?<eos> Jessica Holt.<eos> Do you know what you're saying, Jessica?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Beautiful isn't it?<eos> Well, I can't wait for you to see the real thing.<eos> It's going to be magnificent.<eos> As soon as I finish making it.<eos> William.<eos> You can't do this. You can't...<eos> It's done, Walter.<eos> The final piece has been set into motion.<eos> I couldn't stop it now if I wanted to.<eos> And I don't.
- Until they fall asleep.<eos> Then parachute operation will come, you'll go with them to Nowy Sacz and maybe you'll see your sister.<eos> We'll release her if all goes well.<eos> Just tell that bitch to stop dropping leaflets, cause next time you won't save her.<eos> - What will happen to the unit?<eos> - They'll be taken prisoner.<eos> The officer says you have beautiful eyes and asks if you're a Jew?<eos> If you were a Jew and knew Yiddish, the officer would have a job for you.<eos> So think hard if you know Yiddish or not?<eos> No, I don't.
Well, God knows she needs a new one since your father blew up the old one.<eos> Ooh, beer cone!<eos> I actually just finished cutting his fat head out of all of our albums.<eos> But you guys got divorced over three years ago.<eos> Yeah, well, I spent the first two years trying to ruin his credit.<eos> And then I just kind of landed on this.<eos> Hey, Tuck.<eos> As the newest member of the Wheeler clan, any way I can talk you into taking my mom's car out to Jersey tomorrow to pick up the costumes?<eos> Oh, you know I don't really drive.<eos> Oh, I do!
- "Story" is still with a Y.<eos> - Robert, shove off!<eos> Get lost!<eos> Do you know what you're gonna wear? Up to a hundred shooting stars per hour... I don't know, want to come to dinner?<eos> Then we can dress up together.<eos> Charly!<eos> You randy bitch!<eos> Today wishes may come true. Have you all made a wish list yet? As of today it's not only raining water, but also stars.<eos> - I don't want to listen to that crap.<eos> - Do it yourself.
- Hello?<eos> - Maria, honey, it's me.<eos> - Mikkel.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hello, darling.<eos> Hello, darling. Are you okay?<eos> Has something happened to you?<eos> No, we have it so nice.<eos> No, we do it well.
- What's wrong with you?<eos> - You wiggin'? - Act normal, okay?<eos> - If that's what you want.<eos> - That is what I want.<eos> - That's what you'll get.<eos> Where you going, Schmidt?<eos> Sorry.<eos> This way.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey. - How you doing, kid?
Someone needs to protect him. I do.<eos> Someone needs to protect him from you.<eos> He could go live with Astor and Cody, with their grandparents in Orlando.<eos> I am a good father.<eos> I am the right person-- the only person who can and should raise my son.<eos> Who, like me, lost his mother.<eos> It is not fair of you to expose a child to your life... choices.<eos> You have to decide!<eos> Your desires or--<eos> No, I don't.
What's up?<eos> - Flowers.<eos> Come again?<eos> I should have sent flowers.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> At dinner the other night, when we got called away, I should have sent adalind some flowers.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> Hank, don't you see what's going on here?<eos> She's calling.<eos> Hey, baby, how you doing?
This interview is being recorded, and if at any stage...<eos> That's why I pleaded guilty, in court, so you wouldn't have to relive it all.<eos> Did you... get that?<eos> If at any stage you want to talk to your solicitor on your own, then that's fine.<eos> So, Geoff.<eos> You indicated to Dr Hines that there were other deaths.<eos> Remember when we were kids?<eos> Sorry - if I could just explain... this is why I could never hurt you, and why it's important to me that you should understand that.<eos> There were so many times when I could have, if I'd wanted to, killed you.<eos> But I didn't.
Damn it.<eos> Meredith...<eos> Hey, just don't talk to me.<eos> Okay?<eos> She knew I would hate you, but she didn't want me to hate you.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> It means she's planning to forgive you or she's desperately trying to find a way to forgive you.<eos> And it doesn't matter if it was just sex.<eos> She didn't want me to know, okay?<eos> And now I do, so don't.
Reason I was over the border when you called?<eos> That's where he was during the riots... an experimental treatment center just outside of Toronto.<eos> My gut says that Stone knew about the illness as well, saw that Kane was unfit for office, so he leaks the Bensenville story under the name Rosebud.<eos> Kane ultimately finds out about it and kills him for it.<eos> The burglary gone bad, which every other paper in town seems so ready to print...<eos> I've got the lead detective ready to go on record, say the whole damn thing was a cover-up as long as I pay for it.<eos> Now I'm not exactly ready to bite that fucking bullet, but, goddamn, I mean, we've got him.<eos> - We've got Kane by the balls. - We?<eos> Yeah, you told me Rosebud was Stone.<eos> I did not.
I'm at a dead end on Bay Harbour Butcher.<eos> Everything we've done, all the evidence it still points to Sergeant Doakes.<eos> At some point, we have to face facts.<eos> Harrison is only going to Orlando for a few weeks, Dexter.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> All he'll want to do is follow Cody around.<eos> Every time the shit hits the fan, I go to him.<eos> He's your safe place.<eos> You're making it sound like I wanna be with him or something.<eos> Well, do you?
Oh, my God.<eos> Price?<eos> Did you fucking help her with Price?<eos> No.<eos> I don't even know why I fucking ask you, Dexter.<eos> Every time I think I know exactly who you are you tell me something worse.<eos> Being with Hannah is worse...<eos> -...than being a killer?<eos> No.<eos> I don't...
Who's sending you hugs and kisses?<eos> No one.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> That was a girl.<eos> Was she sexting you?<eos> You got pictures?<eos> Come on, I gotta restock my spank bank.<eos> - Angel, know about Dexter's girlfriend?<eos> - Hannah McKay?<eos> - How did you--?
Y'all a little early for my birthday party.<eos> Hope y'all got strippers and pizza, 'cause otherwise, this is gonna...<eos> Oh, hell no.<eos> Unh-unh. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Terrence.<eos> We are all here because we care about you very much, and we feel like you are on the verge of losing everything.<eos> We know about the pills.<eos> And the flush.<eos> We know about the car crash.<eos> But no one else does.
It may sound absurd, but I have a feeling things are being kept from me.<eos> I knew it, you think I'm mad.<eos> Not at all.<eos> - Things are being kept from you?<eos> Miss Blanchot, because there were no vacancies.<eos> The next day, I got another room, so I left Miss Blanchot's, but I forgot my perfume bottle in her bathroom.<eos> Tell me if I'm speaking too quickly for you.<eos> Since then, I tried to get it back, but I was told Miss Blanchot had left.<eos> I was a bit surprised, she would have told me.<eos> But she didn't, not a word about it.
It courses through you like the water of a river after a storm filling you and emptying you all at once.<eos> You feel it throughout your body... ♪ Coming up only ♪ In your hands... ♪ To show you wrong ♪ in your heart... in your stomach...<eos> ♪ And to know you is hard ♪ ...in your skin... ♪ We wonder ♪ Of course you feel it in your Schlauchmachendejungen.<eos> Pardon my French.<eos> Have you ever felt this way about someone?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> If you have to think about it, you have not felt it.<eos> And you're absolutely sure you'll find that someday?<eos> Of course.<eos> Everyone does eventually.
What about you?<eos> I cleared out the boiler block.<eos> How many were there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A dozen, two dozen.<eos> I have to get back.<eos> Just wanted to check on Carl.<eos> Rick, we can handle taking out the bodies.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - No, I do.
Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> If you want, I can help.<eos> I'm actually here to do some shredding myself.<eos> You know what?<eos> You've ruined the whole thing.<eos> Well, the good news is, we don't have a copy of that memo.<eos> I'm sorry to rain on your parade, but the accusation here isn't that you have it, it's that you buried it, so we should probably move forward.<eos> To what?<eos> We need to put them on the defensive.<eos> - No, we don't.
I'm fine.<eos> How was Lyla?<eos> Medicated.<eos> I'm tossing those.<eos> Maybe we shouldn't.<eos> Wendy came by the hospital today.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> We have to tell him the truth, Jax.<eos> No, we don't.
Now, I can't help but have overheard your entire conversation and taken a side.<eos> Lisa, stand by your man.<eos> Malik, that outfit is fly.<eos> Fine.<eos> I give up.<eos> Let's go to stupid sports camp.<eos> No.<eos> I'll go to macramé camp.<eos> - You need this more than me.<eos> - I really do, Malik. I really do.
That's right.<eos> Why did she kill Claes?<eos> Claes and I would have been rich.<eos> Rich enough to retire.<eos> Maybe move abroad...<eos> - Together.<eos> - That was your plan?<eos> Claes wasn't getting any younger.<eos> Maybe in time, when he was tired of running after women who didn't understand him...<eos> The way I did.
- Anita wanted you to have it.<eos> - What did she say?<eos> - That it was... just a fake?<eos> - Yes. But it is authentic.<eos> - What?<eos> - The painting is the real deal.<eos> As real as the love Alice and Ruben shared.<eos> He didn't sign it... not when he painted it.<eos> And Alice didn't dare have his name on it, in case her husband, Einar, ever found it.<eos> Which he did, seven years later.
- I don't like it!<eos> - I don't ask you either.<eos> I'd say that's mighty white of me, wouldn't you?<eos> I can take care of you.<eos> You won't have to worry about anything.<eos> I'm not worried, Gus.<eos> How long do you think this is going to last?<eos> Don't you think I'm any good?<eos> The business you're in.<eos> You don't, do you?
Sheets, towels, tablecloths, anything that's clean.<eos> There's no ether, of course, so I strongly suggest you get him drunk.<eos> Wash your hands, please.<eos> I'm going to need help.<eos> Bring me alcohol. Sanitize my instrument.<eos> - Come on, it's 15 grand.<eos> - I don't know Magaddino.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I don't know him, Charlie.<eos> All right. Well, I do.
I haven't seen my boy for ten days.<eos> Do you know how long ten days is in a kid's life?<eos> A long time.<eos> Keep thinking about that face.<eos> But not this face.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> I hope you're not upsetting my prisoner.<eos> Where did you find him?<eos> We didn't.
...solemnly swear not to tell our friends that Quinn is a stripper.<eos> "...solemnly swear not to tell our friends that Quinn is a stripper" who duped you out of lots of money.<eos> You're only supposed to repeat after me.<eos> "You're only supposed to repeat after me."<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> Silence! Look, I know that things started out sketchy with me and Quinn, but I really like her, so please.<eos> Do you,<eos> Ted Middle-Name-Omitted Mosby, swear to uphold this Broath?<eos> I do.
That's my seat, dawg.<eos> Vacate, rook.<eos> As I was saying, if you want to be part of Hawks' future, gentlemen, show up on time.<eos> Do not give me a headache, and be on your best behavior because we got cameras.<eos> Sportscom3's in camp this week.<eos> Truth ... they are doing a package on the Hawks' most illustrious package.<eos> Cameras or not, it's gonna be hot in the spotlight, and the pressure's officially on.<eos> So get out there, and don't forget who you're here to impress ... me!<eos> Cameras in camp ... we like this idea?<eos> Unfortunately, our G.M. does.
For all I care, one of you can influence her out to dinner on my dime if it keeps my camp from becoming a full-on circus!<eos> What about you, Donnally?<eos> You're single.<eos> Seriously, take her on a date?<eos> I know, I know, but you know coach.<eos> He's old-school.<eos> Would coach have told you to wine and dine Noelle if she were a man and not this gorgeous woman?<eos> She's gorgeous?<eos> Didn't notice.<eos> Well, none of my business if you did or didn't.
- We have no horse in this race, but there is one thing we want.<eos> Not a lot of people get a second chance.<eos> Just you and probably Obama.<eos> Give it some thought.<eos> - Troy's intel, Greendale is impregnable.<eos> - So, what do we do?<eos> One answer. Elaborate heist?<eos> Elaborate heist?<eos> We'll need disguises.<eos> I do a great swami.
We came out at nine in the morning, am, and we wouldn't leave until 9pm.<eos> Go get sodas, maybe get some cookies, a sandwich, and play.<eos> I mean, I didn't care if it was 100 or whatever. We played all day.<eos> Anywhere there was a sound of a ball, whatever borough, we was gonna play.<eos> We didn't have to know nobody.<eos> We'd walk into the park, call "next". And we'd sit and we'd wait.<eos> And we'd hoop, get up, go to another borough, get on the train, and that's what we did all day.<eos> Then go back home, go to sleep, get up, do it again.<eos> When we was young, I didn't have all that Atari or PlayStation.<eos> We did basketball in the rain.
I don't know what else to do.<eos> I'm in bad shape, man.<eos> It hasn't moved in days.<eos> I think it's dead!<eos> Maybe it's just resting. Come on.<eos> You have to do this for me.<eos> I need a chance to redeem myself.<eos> So, go have sex with her.<eos> You don't need me there.<eos> Yes, I do.
Sorry.<eos> You work with Tommy.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You know, that is a nice bracelet.<eos> Grandma didn't give it to you, did she?<eos> But I know who did.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Where's Tommy, Ashley?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Honestly, I don't.
Yeah, no problem.<eos> Could you please stop starting cases on our day off, though?<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> Stand up. Wh-What's going on?<eos> You're top charge just became Murder Two.<eos> Get on your feet.<eos> You said I'd be out of here.<eos> You said the charge was bribe receiving.<eos> Yeah well, now it's murder in the second degree; will you get up?<eos> I-I didn't do it.
Why did you call me?<eos> Did you have a reason?<eos> What do you want to tell me you cannot say?<eos> Are you getting married?<eos> Are you pregnant?<eos> I'm not getting married.<eos> I'm not pregnant.<eos> You see, I can't read you.<eos> He wants a baby.<eos> Before, I didn't.
Would you like to go someplace private?<eos> I-- you covered for me.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> - I wasn't thanking you.<eos> You and Don-- why do you think I need protecting?<eos> You both like the fantasy of a girl in distress?<eos> - How about I put you in a cab?<eos> - I take the subway.<eos> - Why do you think I need prot--<eos> - I don't.
The experience of the driver.<eos> - And I totally got you there. - Please.<eos> Please.<eos> - I got you.<eos> - You drive like a geezer.<eos> Really?<eos> I drive like a gee--<eos> Tell me, can a geezer do donuts?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Bullshit you ever did donuts.
You need to call a partner meeting.<eos> I'll call for it... five minutes after you get me some proof.<eos> Sorry, Harvey.<eos> Pilates is on Wednesdays.<eos> You and I are gonna go.<eos> And when we're done, you're gonna admit to me what you did.<eos> Oh, I've done a lot of things, Harvey.<eos> Well, I want to know why you settled.<eos> You know damn well why I settled.<eos> No, I don't.
Maybe one of the great ones.<eos> Then you understand why she's better off without me.<eos> That's probably true.<eos> But what makes you think you're better off without her?<eos> The hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> I spent years trying to get back to my boys.<eos> Years.<eos> I walked across the country. And then up and down the East coast.<eos> You'd think I could find one damn ship to take me home.<eos> But I never did.
Oh. No, I can see that.<eos> You've got to admit though, it's still kind of funny.<eos> Mr Perry!<eos> How the hell are you?<eos> So, listen, you know I have this little show, right?<eos> I was wondering...<eos> Who said you're not the first one I called?<eos> Schwimmer's an asshole!<eos> I never said you were an asshole!<eos> No, I did not!
Oh, it might be.<eos> Might very well be.<eos> Picture up!<eos> Am I crazy, or are we seeing the shadow of his, erm...<eos> What?<eos> His, erm, crotchal area.<eos> I don't think that's what...<eos> Oh yes, it is.<eos> Are you guys seeing it too?<eos> I didn't at first.
Were a doctor.<eos> Surely you haven't forgotten how bruising works.<eos> Okay, yeah, sure, these hands do seem a little small for the bruise pattern, but I...<eos> With your permission, Captain, I'd like a moment alone with Dr. Mantlo.<eos> Captain, this...<eos> You got two minutes.<eos> Tall men in your life-- I'd like a list.<eos> Amy was a good person, but if you're here because you think I had something to do with it...<eos> Dr. Mantlo said that you'd made a pass at her at a holiday party last year.<eos> Actually, no, I didn't.
You and me bath.<eos> WOMAN:<eos> I think it's a mistake to lack at Batman's return in purely physical terms.<eos> I think it's a symbolic resurgence of the common man's will to resist. A rebirth of the American soul.<eos> Okay, easy on the rhetoric, Lana.<eos> The only thing Batman signifies is an aberrant psychotic force.<eos> The man's a danger to every citizen.<eos> - Hardly as dangerous as the criminals, is he?<eos> - Batman knows exactly what he's doing.<eos> His kind of fascist always does.
We're not looking for a positive ID on any of these photos.<eos> We're just looking for similar features, okay?<eos> You see something that resembles the guy-- the eyes, the nose--<eos> Jimmy puts it into the sketch.<eos> Can you just try a little more?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> I got it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
- Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna be forced to create some new opportunities outside of SAMCRO.<eos> How much longer you need Trager on that leash?<eos> I'm still putting together the pieces on how to bring Clay down.<eos> When that happens, you can have Trager.<eos> The safe that the Nomads stole when they broke in, they gave Clay back all the legal shit.<eos> That's gonna prove Clay is a traitor and a murderer.<eos> Wendy came by the hospital;<eos> we have to tell him the truth, Jax.<eos> No, we don't.
Scared of being like me.<eos> Eh?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Will you never leave me in peace?<eos> We can't even just be together.<eos> It has to be about you.<eos> Even when you're not there.<eos> You're the only one.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> Do you?
Ok, which one of you snap the wallet?<eos> Hm?<eos> Look, anyone of you that "found" my mother's wallet you'd turn it now, we don't press charges.<eos> You heard Detective Vanilla.<eos> If one of you is the guilty party... Guilty parted better speak up!<eos> - I didn't steal no wallet.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Do it!
I bought a new one.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I mean, it was time.<eos> I wasn't worried.<eos> Got to love that new-car smell.<eos> Pardon the boardinghouse reach.<eos> Okay, buckle up.<eos> You like to drive fast.<eos> I like to drive, period.<eos> I did Paris-Dakar.
The estimated time of death...<eos> 9:26 P.M., June 14, 1995."<eos> Jackson's birthday is June 15th.<eos> Oh, no, I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, yes, I'm leaving.<eos> But none of you are.<eos> You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.<eos> Enjoy the rest of your evening.<eos> The principal wanted to see me?<eos> No... I did.
Send me out on a bender, face-first.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry. See if they mention rendezvous points. Maybe other safe houses.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got most of Ops working on this.<eos> Wouldn't hold your breath, though.<eos> Yeah, about that. Sonya came by to see how I was doing.<eos> Whatever she said to you, it is a lie.<eos> Everyone thinks they know what happened between us.<eos> They don't.
You're home.<eos> - Where did you get these?<eos> - Roxies.<eos> Thank you, Daddy's ACL tear.<eos> - Ollie.<eos> - No one's called me that in a while, Speedy.<eos> Worst nickname ever.<eos> What, always chasing after me as a kid?<eos> I thought it fit pretty well.<eos> - Maybe it still does?
You have to help me get free.<eos> We have a major problem.<eos> She cannot get access to the machine.<eos> Assuming Hanna runs away, a couple years later, she winds up in Lafayette, Louisiana, opens an account, 100 grand is paid in, withdrawn in cash over the next three weeks until the account is closed.<eos> 100 grand.<eos> Where does a 16-year-old runaway get all that money?<eos> Jose Barilla, currently serving 17 life sentences for drug trafficking and murder.<eos> The money was electronically transferred out of his account.<eos> You did say this Root woman was good with computers.<eos> Yes, I did.
He was attacked.<eos> - Shot to death. - They know who did it?<eos> Police said it looked like a drug killing, some trash from over the border, but never caught them.<eos> Trent was a bank loan officer.<eos> Is it possible he got caught up in money laundering?<eos> No, he was a good man.<eos> It was just a mistake.<eos> How long did he know Hanna Frey?<eos> Hanna?<eos> He didn't.
You just got out of relationship jail.<eos> - I think Dan was an alcoholic.<eos> - He was.<eos> He wasn't a real alcoholic... but sometimes he would have, like, 12 beers.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What?<eos> Lev is asking for your number.<eos> Give it to him.<eos> You did just break up with Dan.<eos> Today. Just do it.
Apology not accepted.<eos> Now sit down.<eos> Look, I told you,<eos> I didn't have anything to do with her murder.<eos> And yet, we have witnesses that saw Mandy get in to your car shortly before she was killed.<eos> We know about the affair, Reggie.<eos> Can't imagine your wife would be too happy if she found out, so you made sure she didn't.<eos> What are you talking about, affair?<eos> Yeah, I knew Mandy.<eos> So did my wife.
- What else?<eos> What did you come here to speak with him about?<eos> Someone from my past.<eos> I believe he's come back.<eos> Daniel.<eos> His name is Daniel.<eos> The man you were supposed to marry.<eos> Snow told me what happened, and... how it was her fault that he died.<eos> Yes.<eos> He did.
I am not a what.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't really know what I'm doing.<eos> That much is clear.<eos> Allow me to introduce myself.<eos> Rumplestiltskin.<eos> And I'm...<eos> Regina.<eos> I know.<eos> You do?
Talbott has contact addresses for two separate accountants.<eos> This one is for a rep for DDB.<eos> That's a big five firm, nothing untoward there.<eos> Probably handled the family books.<eos> But this one... is an independent accountant by the name of Martin Rydell.<eos> Handled something Peter calls his "Executive Private Account""<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Secretary?<eos> What did Fowkes say your name was?<eos> He didn't.
Send E.M.S. in here now!<eos> Jane:<eos> Hey, Jonathan, just stay with me, okay?<eos> What did ... what did he do to your mom?<eos> He hurt her.<eos> - Where's your mom now?<eos> - He said she went on the bus.<eos> Is ... is that why you've been riding the bus?<eos> I just wanted to find her.<eos> And then I did.
I just remembered I don't really care.<eos> Where's mom?<eos> Oh, my God, what is that outfit?<eos> Are you going goth?<eos> You still sleep with a stuffed panda.<eos> Don't you have a fraternity to pass out in?<eos> Is there anything else you need for your procedure?<eos> Um, I think I'm supposed to have ice cream.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Actually, I don't...
It was a through and through. And I got one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives dropping into the middle of my peoples' undercover operation?<eos> Is Paddy gonna die?<eos> It doesn't look good. You should have told me you knew Paddy Doyle was in town.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I know. Give me your gun.<eos> What?<eos> It's evidence now.<eos> Now get your [Bleep] back to headquarters.<eos> Captain Connors is gonna need to interview you.<eos> Since when does the head of internal affairs do interviews?
Did you ever return my book, "soothing paint choices for the home"?<eos> Yeah, a long time ago.<eos> So, you're back.<eos> That's odd, 'cause I can't seem to find it.<eos> Did you ever return my "guns of the world digest"?<eos> I always return things I borrow.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Of course I'm sure.<eos> Maybe you lost it.<eos> You do lo things.
An undying desire to majorly fuck you up.<eos> Stop, Guillermo.<eos> Reboot, this is business.<eos> No, Blanca, this is personal.<eos> Take her somewhere private.<eos> I got to take this.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You made it. Come on in.<eos> I got you an orange cranberry scone, but I got hungry.<eos> How you doing?
Please.<eos> She started it.<eos> Don't cut my kid's hair. It's her hair.<eos> What's with all the hostility?<eos> Did you learn nothing in India?<eos> - Scott!<eos> - Dad, break his face!<eos> Yeah!<eos> We want blood!<eos> No, we don't!
If you guys keep a tight core, you can... your burpees can look like this, too.<eos> When's the Olympics? Right, guys?<eos> I'm gonna set a PR tonight.<eos> Well, you know, he's not... he's not...<eos> Parkour.<eos> - Oh! You got beer on her, man.<eos> Did I do that?<eos> Don't worry, my mom can throw that dress in with my laundry next time she's here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your mom does your laundry?
Uh, girlfriend.<eos> Jane.<eos> She had to go change.<eos> Don't you think it's time that you take the next step before you really do earn the title of New York's most eligible bachelor?<eos> I think we're okay with how things are right now.<eos> Spoken like every man who's ever lived to the women he had no intention of proposing to her.<eos> Oh, no. I... I definitely want to marry her.<eos> She doesn't?<eos> No. She...<eos> - She doesn't.

I... I definitely want to marry her.<eos> She doesn't?<eos> No. She...<eos> - She doesn't.<eos> - She does,<eos> I do, just not at this moment.
It's my life. Then I don't have a choice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Do it.<eos> - What? Father?<eos> Father, what... what are you doing?<eos> Stop! - Good-bye, Belle.<eos> Yeah, that's him, all right.<eos> Do you remember turning a butcher into a pig?<eos> Can't say that I do.<eos> Why? Well, he does.
What for?<eos> Lavon got arrested for shoplifting? !<eos> Um, you know what?<eos> I suddenly don't feel like I need that drink after all.<eos> Do you think that she heard me?<eos> Oh, I think there's a very good possibility of that, yes.<eos> Okay, don't freak out.<eos> Oh, I love it when you start that way.<eos> You know how you're supposed to separate the whitwh and the colors?<eos> Well, I do.
You should be naked with strangers. Boat optional.<eos> I'm not really the-the one-night stand type of person.<eos> How would you know, you haven't given it a shot.<eos> Yeah, that's true, but... Look, even if I did, I don't have those kind of moves.<eos> And besides, this is a small town, okay? People talk and... Now Lemon works at the only bar.<eos> Well, you are in luck, my friend.<eos> Because Lemon is not working tonight and I am.<eos> And there is a whole crew of lady beach volleyball players passing through town.<eos> Can you say, bump, set and...<eos> You do the spike.
♪ Let me call you Sweetheart<eos> ♪ I'm in love<eos> ♪ With you ♪<eos> Is there anything for our supper?<eos> I've hidden a veal-and-egg pie.<eos> Oh, I wish you'd let me talk to Mr Carson.<eos> I don't want to be a sick woman in his eyes for the next two months.<eos> Or a dying one, in the months to come after that.<eos> I know it'll be all right.<eos> No, you don't.
I can only regard this as a ploy, considering the circumstances.<eos> You were, after all, caught in the act.<eos> No, uh, Sister, this is, uh... this is not about Grace and me.<eos> This is about my crimes.<eos> Your crimes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I know I'm not a very religious man, but I did go to Sunday school, and I was taught that God sees everything.<eos> Is that true?<eos> It is.<eos> And he does.
He's putting a good face on it, but you know he wants you with him on this, more than anything.<eos> I should not serve him well.<eos> I don't have the instincts for what he wants to do.<eos> You mean you're not a tradesman?<eos> Your word, not mine.<eos> Shall I tell you how I look at it?<eos> Every man or woman who marries into this house, every child born into it, has to put their gifts at the family's disposal.<eos> I'm a hard worker, and I've some knowledge of the land.<eos> Matthew knows the law and the nature of business.<eos> Which I do not.
Right.<eos> Let's go, fellas.<eos> Are you looking for someone?<eos> What?<eos> You've been staring out that window.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry about your friend.<eos> Dr. Whitehead.<eos> Thank you for coming, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> No one else did.
We have a hot detective.<eos> Looks like he died of natural causes.<eos> Maybe a heart attack.<eos> Heart attack.<eos> But he was so young!<eos> I mean, he and I were practically the same age.<eos> Didn't we celebrate your 40th Birthday for the 5th time last...<eos> Shut up Wood!<eos> So you guys found him this morning?<eos> Well, Reggie did.
Please let me stay.<eos> I can't go home tonight.<eos> Let me see your face.<eos> Let me see your face.<eos> Someone has slapped you.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Is it someone you know?<eos> My mom.<eos> Your mother?<eos> She does that sometimes.
I should have listened to you.<eos> I won't make that mistake again.<eos> Good.<eos> (Both laugh)<eos> But, hey, this race is far from over.<eos> And we may be down in votes, but I know that this town will come to its senses, and we will win this thing.<eos> (Grunts)<eos> Sometimes I feel like you believe in me even more than I believe in myself.<eos> I don't know what I'd do without you, Lemon Breeland.<eos> I really don't.
He's at Aqua with his homies,<eos> "watching" the draft, and he's trending.<eos> "Hashtag -- Minefield make T.K. go boom."<eos> Yeah, I got it. "Terrence King is straight up done and burnt, like a steak left on the grill a week too long."<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Here comes your Twitter ghost.<eos> T.K. says, "Does the Minefield want the king of pain to go boom on his candy ass again?"<eos> You tweeted that!<eos> Yeah, I know -- I just said I tweeted that!<eos> You did it!
I can't even get into my place.<eos> It's just all fucked up over there now.<eos> Well, where are you even staying, then?<eos> I don't even know.<eos> Well, um...<eos> - Is there any other way... - ( Scoffs )<eos> Don't you have to take tests?<eos> Yeah, I do, but it's not a problem.<eos> ( Scoffs ) Maybe I should just go.<eos> No, no, no. Don't, don't.
You'll hear us, we'll hear you.<eos> Test, 1, 2.<eos> Is that coming through?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> And we'll be nearby in case anything goes wrong.<eos> And we won't be seen.<eos> It'll just be our team, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> How you doing, Sloan?
Well, it's Halloween.<eos> Of course your parents have to work.<eos> Other parents don't.
Frank, Fran?<eos> We did host a Father Fran Ainsworth, but he's since moved on.<eos> How long since?<eos> I'd have to look at the parish calendar.<eos> You know, with all due respect, Father, I'm getting the sense you're being a little less than forthcoming with us.<eos> And with all due respect, Detective, I have no knowledge of the whereabouts of the attacker.<eos> Okay, well, Father Ainsworth might.<eos> You'd have to ask him.<eos> I don't know where he was sent to next.<eos> Yeah, of course you don't.
! Ooh. (Laughs)<eos> Uh... I don't know. Would you call the Hindenburg a disaster?<eos> Uh, hmm...<eos> Hmm.<eos> Well, you survived.<eos> Very true. Very true.<eos> And it actually did feel good to have myself out there.<eos> You know, just trying.<eos> Just got to put yourself first sometimes, I guess.<eos> Yeah, you do.
No, no, it's fine.<eos> I'm actually kind of glad that it didn't happen.<eos> You know what they say.<eos> You don't just marry the man. You marry the whole family.<eos> For reasons that I'll never fully know, Victoria decided early on she didn't want my relationship with Daniel to work, and so... it didn't.<eos> Please don't tell them that I'm telling you this.<eos> I don't need any more bad blood with the Graysons. Don't worry.<eos> I'm very good with secrets.<eos> And as far as the Graysons go, they'll get what's coming to them.<eos> People like that always do.
Don't say anything bad about the Cowboys.<eos> And whatever you do, don't -- do not use the words "moist" or "irregardless."<eos> There goes my opener.<eos> Hi, Dad!<eos> Ohh, munchkin!<eos> Okay, embarrassing.<eos> That is my job, kiddo.<eos> So, who's this handsome fella?<eos> Yeah, he's a good boy!<eos> How you doing there?
It was a nightmare.<eos> I'm walking down the street, minding my own business, and I see one of the nannies that I interviewed, and I'm thinking,<eos> "Maybe I can get her behind a Dumpster and interview her again."<eos> But then...<eos> And then...<eos> They were everywhere.<eos> I was surrounded! Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you really think you could get away with this?<eos> As a matter of fact, I did, yeah.
This gym is pretty nice.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to own it instead of just working here.<eos> Personally, I've always taken great pleasure in being my own boss.<eos> ♪ how did I get here... ♪ How could you do this to me?<eos> Just because I didn't give your geriatric boyfriend a seat doesn't mean that you had to tell Sage to sabotage my show!<eos> Save it, Blair.<eos> You were so upset that I care more about Steven than your show that you had to destroy my relationship.<eos> I didn't tell her to take off the dress. You did.<eos> No, I didn't.
Otto Jackson?<eos> Kate, come here for a second.<eos> Otto Jackson's a big-time distributor out of Harlem.<eos> Looks like he's making a move downtown.<eos> I know Otto.<eos> How the hell do you know Otto?<eos> He wore a wire for me before, okay?<eos> Can you...?<eos> This guy Otto-- you get your stuff off of him?<eos> All the dealers on campus do.
You should have killed me when you had the chance.<eos> May you always run free beneath the moon's pale light.<eos> Goodbye, Mother.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> (SIGHS DEEPLY) I know what it's like to lose your family.<eos> I didn't lose my family today.<eos> I protected it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My mother wanted me to choose between being a wolf and being a human.<eos> Granny did, too.
No, no, no, no.<eos> You're just too busy back there not putting on deodorant.<eos> You gotta laugh.<eos> Do you?<eos> Max, I might be crazy but now I feel like the heel of this shoe's starting to--<eos> Oh, gosh.<eos> Now I got to go wipe this down.<eos> You know, I was going to wear this for my audition.<eos> And that's gotta go well.<eos> Yes, it does.
These nameless individuals agree, which is why they have donated their bodies to science.<eos> Now help me roll this one over, so I can try a chokehold.<eos> I did say you were free not to join me for these experiments.<eos> I know.<eos> It's hardly surprising that being in a hospital makes you uncomfortable, you being a disgraced surgeon and all. I'm fine, okay?<eos> You've had your arms crossed for 13 of the 15 minutes that we've been here.<eos> It's a classic self-comforting posture, an attempt to neutralize the distress signals being sent by your limbic system.<eos> Of course, it is possible that your stress is subconscious and you really do believe that you're fine.<eos> But given that your eyes are doing that thing they do when you lie, I sincerely doubt that's the case. - I'm not lying.<eos> - Doing it again.
All clear.<eos> All right.<eos> Chuck Bass is considered a person of interest in this case, as he's wanted for questioning, although we have no information on his whereabouts.<eos> Now being a person of interest does not necessarily mean he's a suspect at this point.<eos> What it means is that police feel he'll have information on this case.<eos> By the time I got to the party, Chuck was already gone.<eos> I didn't even see him.<eos> So you, uh, missed the outburst where he accused his father of trying to kill him?<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Do you?
I want you to really understand.<eos> General Subutai knew that when he entered Europe, they'd be outnumbered.<eos> And he was ready for it.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> He wanted his enemies to be vanquished by their own arrogance.<eos> When he gave his first order, Çağatay and Genghis Khan's sons probably gave him strange looks.<eos> Because this tactic, worked in steppes and deserts with a few cavalrymen.<eos> Not in woods or battlefields against knights.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> You don't.
It would be different for me since very few short-termers die on duty.<eos> You know what would make me sad the most if I died?<eos> My father crying as he buried me.<eos> He has a father, too.<eos> The son did what he did, but what's the father's crime?<eos> I can't think of anything that would make me feel worse.<eos> Isn't that strange?<eos> We think the enemy is like us only when he's dead.<eos> You have no control over your mouth, Bekir, I swear.<eos> - As if you did.
I have something far more satisfying in mind.<eos> I'm going to leave you here with your thirst for revenge unquenched, while I complete our journey without you.<eos> There's no need to be rash.<eos> We can... discuss this.<eos> Your pretty face buys you a lot, but not my time.<eos> It's too valuable.<eos> I can do this.<eos> I can get it back.<eos> You need me.<eos> No, I don't.
You have 20 minutes.<eos> After that, you're gonna go to prison for obstruction of justice.<eos> You know, maybe he'll get lucky.<eos> Maybe they'll put him in Lompoc.<eos> Oh.<eos> You know what's great about Lompoc?<eos> You get a little glimpse of the surf when you're sitting in the prison yard.<eos> I want to talk to Sonny.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I do.
Don't ask how or why or who, but I just found the answer to your Tyler problem.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> We don't need the sword.<eos> This is the mark of the brotherhood of the five.<eos> Then up the arm, you have the murder of a girl by a witch.<eos> The symbols in the vines are your map, which you obviously no longer need.<eos> When this mark is complete, it will contain the spell that we need to dig up Silas.<eos> And where did you say he was buried?<eos> Oh, I forgot.<eos> You didn't.
Denver?<eos> Denver.<eos> So... I'd probably be a skier.<eos> When you aren't busy saving lives in the E.R.<eos> I like the sound of my Denver life.<eos> Well, I-I came here 'cause, um, I have another case for you.<eos> It is always work, work, work with you, Zalanski.<eos> Yeah, well, look, I was out walking, And, I saw this guy heading into his brownstone But he reeked of blood.<eos> Was he injured?<eos> No, he didn't
Thanks for the vote of confidence.<eos> Mr. Grobet's approval is key to securing my leadership at the company.<eos> I'm happy to help.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> There's a nice touch...<eos> Trotting Ashley out, considering Salvador's penchant for exotic women.<eos> I would think he'd have better self-preservation instincts, seeing as his wife holds his fortune. Ah.<eos> Conrad.<eos> We need to discuss your son's future.<eos> No, we don't.
What?<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> You were like, he's a...<eos> Todd<eos> Let me be the first to apologize on behalf of Wood, who refused to believe in you.<eos> Look, guys, no sweat.<eos> You were just looking out for your friend.<eos> That makes you kings in my book.<eos> So, now, who wants Martinis?<eos> Me. I do.
Great. What does your dad think?<eos> Don't worry about him.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> When you're back, I'll tell him.<eos> Promise.<eos> Seeing you at work will change his mind, I'm sure.<eos> You think?<eos> I promise.<eos> My mom thinks so.<eos> - She does? - Yes.
What will happen, do you imagine, when these peace commissioners arrive?<eos> We'll hear them out.<eos> Splendid.<eos> And next, the Democrats will invite them up to hearings on the Hill.<eos> And the newspapers... Oh, the newspapers.<eos> The newspapers will ask,<eos> "Why risk enraging the Confederacy" "over the issue of slavery" "when they're here to make peace?"<eos> We'll lose every Democrat we've got, more than likely conservative Republicans will join them, and all our work, all our preparing the ground for the vote laid waste for naught.<eos> The Blaire promised support for the amendment if we listen to these people.<eos> Oh, the Blaire promise, do they?
I should have clapped you in the madhouse!<eos> Then do it!<eos> Do it! Don't you threaten me!<eos> You do it this time.<eos> Lock me away.<eos> You'll have to, I swear, if Robert is killed.<eos> I couldn't tolerate you grieving so for Willie because I couldn't permit it in myself.<eos> Though I wanted to, Mary.<eos> I wanted to crawl under the earth, into the vault, with his coffin.<eos> And I still do.
Let that spiritual energy pulse through you and out into the world.<eos> Through abhinaya.<eos> Anandi, come to the front. Lead them.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> What?<eos> You were following me.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> In the dance, you went from pataka... which means the forest.<eos> And then you did... samputa... which means something that is hidden.<eos> And then you did chatura.
I know that, I just...<eos> But out of curiosity, do they have any American kids there?<eos> Or even, like half Chinese half American kids?<eos> Babe, American babies are ridiculously expensive and impossible to get.<eos> There used to be tons of Russian babies, but one of them went a little crazy, so that was that.<eos> India won't let their babies out.<eos> We could go Ethiopian?<eos> What do they have, like a menu?<eos> So I did some quick research.<eos> Of course you did.
Protecting innocent people from bad guys.<eos> I stand for law and order. That's what I stand for.<eos> Okay?<eos> I wear a badge.<eos> This guy wears a mask like an outlaw.<eos> He's hunting down criminals that all look the same... like he's got some sort of personal vendetta.<eos> But he's not protecting innocent people, Mr. Parker.<eos> Let's get some air, Peter.<eos> - Dad, we need to talk.<eos> - Yes, we do.
There's only one way to toughen skin.<eos> By mutating it.<eos> Yes, that's what I did.<eos> Transgenesis.<eos> I transferred genetic information... from a pig's cell to a human cell.<eos> A pig's cell?<eos> It's much stronger than ours.<eos> You're insane!<eos> You know the application of transgenetic therepy... in humans is completely forbidden!<eos> Yes, I do.
Make a connection soon, Mr. Haller.<eos> But the witness will answer.<eos> -I don't remember any Bentley.<eos> -Sure you do.<eos> You testified that he confessed to you... the crime that he was charged with.<eos> Raping a 10 year old girl.<eos> But he denied it in court.<eos> Are they ringing any bells?<eos> DJ? 1989, I was high a lot.<eos> I don't much recall...
I was going to ask you that.<eos> Where would you say that we are?<eos> Well it looks like King's Cross station.<eos> Only cleaner. And without all the trains.<eos> King's Cross, is that right?<eos> This is, as they say, your party.<eos> I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate since that night in Godric's Hollow all those years ago.<eos> So it's true then, sir?<eos> A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?<eos> Did.
- No, it's preposterous.<eos> I'm a school teacher. I teach English at Rampart High.<eos> I am not a murderer.<eos> - How do you know Alan Marsh?<eos> I want you to talks a look at something.<eos> That's you, right, Mr. Gerard?<eos> Yes.<eos> And here comes Alan Marsh.<eos> Now, how do you know Mr. Marsh?<eos> - I don't.
I need you to trust me.<eos> I need you to trust me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay, come on.<eos> Door, door, door!<eos> Find another door!<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> What the hell is going on, David?<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> - How did we just do that?
We don't know.<eos> Is it a worm?<eos> It's a mushroom.<eos> Yeah, shiitake.<eos> Monkey, taste it.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Is it shiitake?<eos> He can't understand you.<eos> STU:<eos> He just did.
Look you black bastard, don't be a crybaby,<eos> I know injuries and it's only a sprain.<eos> Two days of rest and Arsenal will sign you!<eos> And stop yelling, people are taking naps.<eos> Let's go. Everything's ready.<eos> The game-'s at fever pitch.<eos> In daylight, this looks a lot smaller.<eos> It looks kid-size. An average person can't fit in there.<eos> Of course an average person can fit in there.<eos> I do.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> And I thank you.<eos> Separate, but equal.<eos> That's what Ross Barnett says, and you can't argue with the governor.<eos> Well, certainly not in Mississippi, the birthplace of modern-day government.<eos> Can I get you something?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Yule Mae, I wanted to talk to you about something.<eos> I already know what you're gonna ask, Miss Skeeter.<eos> Minny and Aibileen already did.
Have you talked to anyone about this difficulty?<eos> No one.<eos> But everyone knows by now.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> But the others have great trust in me.<eos> - The others?<eos> - I'd like to do so much. So many things need to be changed. I'd like...<eos> - So, you work.<eos> - Yes, but... no.<eos> What do you do?
It is his boss.<eos> I mean, he's the one who's going to get recognized.<eos> Finger-flage.<eos> It's called finger-flage.<eos> Finger-flage.<eos> This is actually a pretty damn good idea, dude.<eos> Just roll up your window.<eos> Please, I can't...<eos> DALE:<eos> Do the finger-flage.
That's true.<eos> You don't know how to love.<eos> - I tried.<eos> You could've been happy.<eos> With that woman!<eos> That Zahira!<eos> That's right, with that Zahira!<eos> She scares me.<eos> She disturbes me.<eos> Yes, she does.
I think you are doing just fine.<eos> It sounds like the gasoline is turning into varnish inside the carburetor.<eos> Boring stuff, but isn't a problem.<eos> That's really sweet of you to help me out like this.<eos> Maybe there's something I can do for you?<eos> What do you have in mind?<eos> Maybe we could play a game.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you like games?<eos> I do now.
I know. But don't hate me yet, trust me.<eos> I got mine coming.<eos> - Now, let me ask you.<eos> You ever look around and the world just seems empty to you?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Has it ever occurred to you that maybe it's because you don't have God in your life? - No.<eos> - Never?<eos> - Look, Joe, when I was a kid,<eos> I totally believed in God. But, you know, you grow up.<eos> Well, I did.
All that for Jo's son.<eos> Who would trust Jo Canavaro? He's a loser.<eos> Even if he has a team, he'll take a thrashing.<eos> He should have learned table tennis.<eos> There he is.<eos> You can tell him yourself.<eos> I'll leave you.<eos> He's in shape these days.<eos> - I'll put up more flyers.<eos> - Well, do that.
-No, where would Torsten understand.<eos> -What will you do?<eos> -Do not pull in Peter.<eos> He will be silent.<eos> The investigation is still on you are obsessed with Torsten.<eos> No, because we neither the murder weapon or body.<eos> It may be Karin, too. We know that she threatened Elin.<eos> Who saw Jari come out of the woods?<eos> -We do not know. Damn!<eos> We do not even what Elin did up there.
In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the company that sued him, the Wennerström Group...<eos> The shit hits the fan.<eos> ...of criminal activities on a global scale.<eos> What happens now?<eos> Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta, which won't wash.<eos> The police will investigate, Fl will investigate.<eos> It'll go to court. Maybe he'll go to prison.<eos> You think?<eos> Probably not.<eos> These guys never do.
Fucking wanker.<eos> This is for Freebo!<eos> For West.<eos> And for me!<eos> My man's number one!<eos> Nice, Turk.<eos> The fuck? Run, Turk.<eos> Run.<eos> - Freebo didn't deserve this.<eos> - None of us do.
Fine.<eos> Charlotte Vilanelle, neighbour of your beach house declared that on the night of 27/28 July 2001 noise of children and adults could be heard.<eos> Can you explain?<eos> It's a place where we entertain and that we often lend.<eos> Have you ever slept with children there?<eos> Never.<eos> There's one room for the kids and another for us.<eos> So how come Mrs Vilanelle heard you spend the night with children and say: "Pyjama's on!"<eos> What is this? A bad joke?<eos> So what if I did?
It is in the dark and they are playing music ... And it goes way too fast to do something stupid.<eos> - See you.<eos> - Sometime.<eos> - Soon.<eos> - I guess.<eos> - What are you gonna do now?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> It's for you to do something, not me.<eos> I don't have to tell you again that I love you, do I?<eos> You never did.
He gives things to people.<eos> But everything has a price.<eos> The people here need a new start.<eos> They need to be free.<eos> You didn't kill those men in the train, did you?<eos> Now, why would you believe anything I would tell you?<eos> Hey!<eos> Was she so special to you?<eos> I never thought anyone could understand how much.<eos> But you do.
Don't tell me that-- Aubrey, we get the vaccine tomorrow.<eos> You have to trust me, Ellis.<eos> They didn't touch me.<eos> ALAN:<eos> After the Spanish flu in 1918, you know, people got rich.<eos> The Vicks VapoRub people, the Lysol people, look it up.<eos> One man dies, another man makes money off his coffin.<eos> One country culls all their chickens, red meat goes into higher demand.<eos> I'm not the first person to make money off the fact that our immune system is a work in progress.<eos> The pharmaceutical industry do it every quarter.
Yeah. I know.<eos> It will only take a second.<eos> All right, what is it?<eos> Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here.<eos> This has never been a problem.<eos> No, it hasn't.<eos> But sometimes, in acute situations such as this, often what is right can take on multiple interpretations.<eos> Sam will step up.<eos> Oh, I know he will.<eos> But if he doesn't...
It's here.<eos> Very nice.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> From last summer.<eos> Not in front of me.<eos> If you prefer.<eos> Go back to your architect.<eos> What a bad film!<eos> You didn't like it? Too bad.<eos> - You did?
Twice for yes, once for no.<eos> That was yes.<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> Did you sleep in here all night?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You know, if you don't... if you don't like me, you should just say so.<eos> What?<eos> Otherwise, what's the point of me doing all this for you?<eos> Do you like someone else?<eos> - Do you? - Yes.
How about you let go, you...<eos> Give me the phone, Donnie!<eos> You still think you can take me?<eos> What? Is this all you got, huh?<eos> I'm gonna wash your mouth out with fist.<eos> Oh! I don't understand this relationship, Emma.<eos> Hey, Emma.<eos> Doing this show, it feels like we've become like a little family, huh?<eos> You mean like you're my brother?<eos> No. N... no, I don't.
[LOCK CLICKS]<eos> [DOOR OPENS]<eos> What happened to my husband?<eos> [SIGHS]<eos> - Look, I don't know.<eos> - Don't lie to me.<eos> I know who you are, Sam.<eos> I know what you do.<eos> What?<eos> You do?
You finally had a family.<eos> And you were building something.<eos> And it's as close to happiness as I've ever seen a hunter get.<eos> Dean?<eos> - Ben, just stay there. - I thought I heard you... I said stay back!<eos> Ben won't even talk about it.<eos> This is the worst time in the universe to talk.<eos> Can we do this later?<eos> You shoved my kid, Dean.<eos> How about we do this now?
Ange, you can't take my phone.<eos> I need...<eos> You know, I need my phone.<eos> I need my... Why?<eos> There's...<eos> You're worried about the test results, aren't you?<eos> No. I'm not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I just, you know...<eos> I don't...
So with this thing I will be drinking free all night long.<eos> [WOMEN GIGGLING]<eos> Oh.<eos> Got it.<eos> After all the years that I've known you, I don't think I've seen you this happy.<eos> Well, it wouldn't be the same without you being here.<eos> I just wish I could freeze this moment in time forever.<eos> Me too.<eos> Unfortunately, the limo is here, so we should go.<eos> Oh, but before we do, a toast.
No one sent me.<eos> Because this is a house of magic.<eos> Sounds like most of the house is still owned by the bank.<eos> But the rest of it is magic. Ooh...<eos> How did you do all that?<eos> Permit me to introduce myself.<eos> I am... the Great Raymondo!<eos> I was once the most famous illusionist in the world, performing for pashas and potentates, Grand Dukes and Grande Dames...<eos> Who wants to hear an old man go on about bygone wonders?<eos> I do, I do!
I'm gonna clamp your body parts off one by one.<eos> But then I'm gonna clamp your wounds shut so you stay alive... while I clamp you some more!<eos> Say your prayers, stoolie.<eos> Okay.<eos> God bless Grandma and Grandpa...<eos> They're next!<eos> Right now I'm gonna cut your damn head off!<eos> Drop the robot!<eos> I thought I told you,<eos> I do the cutting around here.
Let me read it to you. "Is she really..""<eos> Come on, Wendy.<eos> We're all adults.<eos> We all could have gone into aluminum siding but we didn't-- we chose politics.<eos> I haven't gone there with either of you.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> And I'm telling you I didn't do it.<eos> Now tell me why you're really here.<eos> I want a two-way race.<eos> I do, too.
Well, I think that six months is a very short time to go from victimizer to victim.<eos> - Saint Paul did it in a second.<eos> - Oh, so you're Saint Paul?<eos> No, just someone who thinks Lockhart Gardner is just this side of incompetent and is gonna lose a lot of money for some very nice, deserving people.<eos> - Hey, hon?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Tell Kalinda why I quit my job.<eos> Oh, I don't think she wants to hear any of that, hon.<eos> Sure, she's a reporter.<eos> Of course she does.

Just so we're clear, we didn't consider the offer made to your co-counsel,<eos> Mr. Canning, to be a low-ball offer. We consider it to be our offer.<eos> - Our best, last and final.<eos> - Well, how nice for you.<eos> - We'll see you in court.<eos> - Good.<eos> Okay, wait, wait.<eos> Look, we're not trying to pick your pockets.<eos> We just need to show the judge a hint of movement.<eos> - No, we don't.
And so does Grandpa.<eos> Does he say anything?<eos> No.<eos> But sometimes he calls me Dylan.<eos> He said that he didn't want the job.<eos> That he was just coming to New York to explore his options.<eos> What a crock of gas.<eos> You fly across the country to explore your options? Please. I don't think so.<eos> Exactly! Please, I knew I had him the second he got off that plane.<eos> - Oh, did you, now?
One, two, three, four, five.<eos> There you'll stay forever.<eos> Hollowface woke up because someone called his name.<eos> After many, many years, he was free.<eos> John?<eos> He's back.<eos> Who is back?<eos> You know who.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, son.<eos> Yes, you do.
No, before you knew she wasn't me.<eos> She was fun, right?<eos> She had an easier smile.<eos> I mean, that's what you said.<eos> Olivia, I said that because I wanted you to know that I noticed the differences.<eos> But I thought it was because of me.<eos> Because of us.<eos> I thought that I was bringing out a different side in you.<eos> But it was never because I wanted to be with her more.<eos> Because I don't.
You don't understand.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I do.<eos> And finding out your father isn't the person you grew up idolizing sucks, but it doesn't mean he loves you any less.<eos> Then what does it mean?<eos> It means that he's human.<eos> Okay, and you have a chance, if you want, to get to know the real him...<eos> the good and the bad.<eos> What if I don't want to?<eos> You do.
What are you up to today?<eos> Jenna and I are supposed to go to her lake house but somehow we both got roped into doing this Historical Society thing at the Lockwoods'.<eos> Where Elijah's the guest of honor.<eos> - You're not gonna kill him at the party.<eos> - No, heh, that would be stupid.<eos> I wanna know his endgame before I kill him.<eos> But I do think it's time Elijah and I officially met.<eos> Okay, so tell me about this big witchy plan you've been cooking up.<eos> We don't know the extent of what Elijah's up to.<eos> No, we don't.
Because if I'd have chosen differently, I wouldn't have met you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I've done so many things to hurt you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I know you love Stefan.<eos> And it will always be Stefan.<eos> But I love you.<eos> You should know that.<eos> I do.
- It's over. - It'll be my fault.<eos> - Like father, like son.<eos> Rabbits are not otters.<eos> - I thought so.<eos> I told you, Yulya.<eos> Marc has something .. .. To tell me.<eos> - Alice searched in your phone?<eos> - This is because of my book.<eos> - Come, let's talk.<eos> - But we never did that.
They get right down to brass tacks.<eos> Blehh! "Which way's the picnic?"<eos> Blehh! "That way." Humans are more evolved.<eos> We lie.<eos> - Not all the time.<eos> - That's a lie.<eos> - We don't lie when we're alone.<eos> - Biggest lie ever.<eos> Nine out of ten lies occur six inches away from the bathroom mirror.<eos> We do most of our lying alone.
- It's "suh-mores.", not "s'mores."<eos> - No, you're saying it wrong<eos> I just found out about it.<eos> It's pronounced "s'mores."<eos> Yeah, it's a contraction of "some mores."<eos> So contract it.<eos> Stop saying "suh-mores" unless you "can not."<eos> Guys!<eos> We need to stop fighting.<eos> No, we don't.
Get in the fucking car!<eos> - Take whatever you want.<eos> Take it.<eos> Take it. Just don't hit me.<eos> - Get in the car!<eos> - Just don't do this.<eos> Kevin!<eos> Please don't do this! Come on.<eos> Get in the fucking car.<eos> Please, please don't do this.
What took you so long?<eos> - It's your dad, Knut.<eos> Come home this instant! Do you realize what time it is?<eos> - I held my arms around Jørgen.<eos> - You did?<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - Nothing. Think he wants to be your boyfriend?<eos> We're going to write love letters to Jørgen and Einar.<eos> I don't think Einar wants to be my boyfriend.<eos> Sure he does.
In love with you.<eos> But she didn't love you.<eos> You're in love with yourself.<eos> That's your weakness. Eh?<eos> Then, of course, you found out that she was shagging this one.<eos> I did not touch her.<eos> Was Claire shocked when you grabbed the knife, Zach, huh?<eos> Did she scream?<eos> Did you stand there and watch her bleed?<eos> Did you?
You understand the dark side. - I do?<eos> - You've seen some shit.<eos> A handsome man comes with a price.<eos> It's a burden. And you understand that.<eos> And thus the motherfuckin' dark side.<eos> You know you want to go!<eos> Well, you know you do!<eos> Like a sex machine?<eos> Moving it?<eos> Doing it?

- Fuck you.<eos> Come on, kitty cat.<eos> You OK?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Charlie?<eos> I got this.<eos> She is just my kind of psycho.<eos> I'm gonna get a ride with Ben and Karen.<eos> Traitor.<eos> Don't do that.
And we'll meet again, cause I'm your grandma.<eos> -You're my little girl!<eos> -Bye, grandma.<eos> Lotte!<eos> Well, I guess this is goodbye.<eos> -So what happens next?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> We'll have to keep in touch.<eos> I don't know how much of a father you think you can be, but...<eos> No, neither do I.
He's a genius.<eos> Vuitton.<eos> I love this song.<eos> "March 1900"<eos> "The dawn of the 20th century"<eos> Spread your thighs.<eos> - Go on, spread them.<eos> - No!<eos> I need to see inside your sex to paint you.<eos> Even to do your face.
Music continues.<eos> I think it's great that you want help him.<eos> He was always a quiet child, but now he is so funny.<eos> It is always locked.<eos> hardly knows what going on in it.<eos> But he's not really stupid.<eos> The village keep me all for a thick skull, fürjemanden who always wants to be right.<eos> What?<eos> Will you?<eos> Of course I do.
Well, open it.<eos> - I mean, who got me that?<eos> - Mum.<eos> Christine, we said: "No gift between us".<eos> I'm sorry but I have nothing for you.<eos> We said: "No gift",<eos> Why did you do it anyway?<eos> It's OK.<eos> It's OK, but now I'm ridiculous. What?<eos> People usually do it anyway.
Happy birthday.<eos> How do you say?<eos> My best wishes,<eos> Christine. This is for you.<eos> So how is it going, David?<eos> Is it yarrow? That's it?<eos> I love that.<eos> It reminds me my childhood.<eos> Sorry, but I think we don't know you.<eos> Do you or not? - We don't.
That was close.<eos> Oh, this way.<eos> Hey.<eos> A Kappa.<eos> A Kappa!<eos> It's a Kappa, a Kappa!<eos> Hey, I saw a Kappa!<eos> I said I saw a Kappa!<eos> A Kappa, everyone!<eos> I really did.
- But glad you're here.<eos> - Listen, Mr. Hanover, I...<eos> - I brought back the money.<eos> - Jo, what, are you crazy?<eos> The money's for you, every damn penny.<eos> You've earned it. Hiring you to be her friend was the best money we've ever spent.<eos> Please, Mr. Hanover, I can't.<eos> Jo, I'm sending it right back to you.<eos> I'd give a bonus, if I gave them.<eos> Which I don't.
There are bats here.<eos> That are not there.<eos> They live there and come out at night.<eos> That's not nice.<eos> - You pissed your pants. Let me go.<eos> Of course I'm scared of bats.<eos> They have herpes or rabies.<eos> You know what we should do?<eos> Get a cat. Cats eat bats.<eos> That cats do not.
Ali.<eos> They said you were dead.<eos> Yeah, I heard that, too, but here I am.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> It's complicated, Hanna.<eos> Really complicated...<eos> worse than algebra.<eos> What happened when you left the barn?<eos> We all wanna know.<eos> You already do...
So how you feeling, Hank?<eos> Oh, well, you know.<eos> Kind of feels like one of those cones they put on dogs so they don't lick their own balls.<eos> Nice. Thank you.<eos> Stay classy.<eos> Anyway, hanging in there.<eos> Glad you stopped by.<eos> Listen, I'm- - I'm sorry about all this.<eos> That guy-- he just came out of nowhere.<eos> Yeah, actually, he didn't.
You are everything that he's wanted.<eos> You're his cook now.<eos> You're the cook, and you have proven that you can run a lab without me, and now that cook has reason to kill me.<eos> Think about it!<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> So go ahead.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go ahead.<eos> Put a bullet in my head and kill me right now.<eos> Do it!

No hairy "buts. " Look,I-I just... I want to make sure that you're... you're doing this for you,you know,because it's what you really want.<eos> You know,not for us.<eos> Of course it's what I want.<eos> For me and us.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> But,I mean,you... you'd be buying the house anyway?<eos> Right?<eos> Even if there was no "us"?<eos> Okay,what do you mean,"no us"?
man speaking native language: Ah, I see.<eos> Today is Saturday, the 24th of July.<eos> For the last three years, I've been away from home to do my degree.<eos> And as soon as that finished, I ended up getting a job at a very demanding company.<eos> So I don't really get to see my old man that much.<eos> But whenever I do see him, we always go to the same place and do the same thing and have a catch-up.<eos> man: I just phoned you.<eos> Jack: Yeah, I just got it, actually.<eos> I was about to phone you back.<eos> man: How you doing?
Oh, for heaven's sake. Um...<eos> - Who shall I make it out to?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - Please, Mr...<eos> - Mallory.<eos> Mr Mallory, you'll excuse my brevity, but this is my home.<eos> - Very glad you enjoyed the book.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I didn't much like your book.
Uh, mr. Weaver, I apologize.<eos> I've had this conversation more than once with Lacey.<eos> She knows she's not supposed to use her cell phone in class.<eos> My real concern is what she's using it for.<eos> I know these types of web sites are out there, but a 12 year old looking at paparazzi photos of a dead body?<eos> - You see why I find that disturbing.<eos> - Actually, I don't.
That's how it finally gets you.<eos> And she was taking colchicine?<eos> Every day.<eos> It just wasn't very effective.<eos> Nikki got depressed and discouraged.<eos> She had seen her father waste away from the same disease.<eos> She always said she didn't want to die like that.<eos> And before you go digging him up, uh, he died in a hospital surrounded by doctors almost five years ago.<eos> Who actually found Nikki?<eos> I did.
- What is it?<eos> Catherine Meese wants you as authors for their big-screen adaptation.<eos> (Still, "Stop And Stare" in the background)<eos> Here is the hidden camera?<eos> I stood there until and I looked around and looked for the cameras, but there were none, and Kurt Felix came out either.<eos> Then I thought about it, there must be an April Fool But we have already mid-July.<eos> Geddit?<eos> This is your comeback.<eos> Are you happy at all?<eos> Why does the just me?
Thank God I wasn't going commando.<eos> I'm sorry you had to see that.<eos> Is that a seam ripper?<eos> Could be.<eos> I don't really sew.<eos> Did you do something to Tom's pants?<eos> Lynette.<eos> It's just a thing I do whenever I find out he slept with one of my friends.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have told you about us.<eos> But you did!
Step back jumper.<eos> Fade away.<eos> Nice one.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> One more?<eos> I'm calling the NBA.<eos> That was awesome!<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Three in a row!<eos> I certainly did.
It's funny... when it's the only thing you know, it all seems so normal, but coming here makes you realize how bad things have gotten.<eos> I don't really remember much.<eos> I was just a kid when we left.<eos> Oh, this is my place here.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> This is Josh. - He's new.<eos> - Welcome to Terra Nova.<eos> I'm Tasha.<eos> That's Hunter.<eos> How you doing, fresh?
Yeah, I know you won't.<eos> You know what?<eos> Make that all women.<eos> Make that all women.<eos> Because you're leeches, every one of you suck a man dry, who works like a dog every day and you suck him dry!<eos> Chris...<eos> Stop it!<eos> - Shut up, lady!<eos> Do you know what you're good for, Peg?<eos> Do you?
Must get enough practice.<eos> But even for him, this was ridiculous. Luckily, he had a trump card to play.<eos> D'you wanna dance?<eos> Meanwhile, Alison didn't seem to be enjoying... my hilarious Greek waiter impression.<eos> So, I presume he wooed you with the old, "Hh'I love you, hh'I love you!<eos> There's no hh'other girl hh'in my life!<eos> "Oh, wait, here comes the next plane from Newcastle.<eos> Sorry, you do realise I'm not playing along with the joke.<eos> I do genuinely have a Greek waiter boyfriend called Nicos.<eos> No, of course you do. Brilliant. Nicos.
Excuse us, gents.<eos> You shouldn't have done that.<eos> You've just put yourself in the story.<eos> Technically, that's a theft.<eos> -Oh, right.<eos> No surprise there, then.<eos> -What? What? So he's just picking up where he left off?<eos> -What?<eos> -Oh, come on, you know.<eos> -No, I don't.
To a professional.<eos> Especially those.<eos> But this one, he waits, just to put five more bullets, five bullets, single fire, into a body he surely would've known was already dead.<eos> All that noise, all that risk.<eos> Why'd he do that?<eos> Maybe he didn't like him.<eos> If he didn't like him, he knew him.<eos> So do you know who shot you?<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Well, do you?
We are proceeding.<eos> 40 minutes on the clock.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> David, be careful.<eos> Will do.<eos> Someone should report to home-world command, explain what's been going on.<eos> Well, you go ahead, and when you're back, you can explain it to me.<eos> They must think we're all dead.<eos> It didn't happen.<eos> Yeah, it did.
Excuse me, but who are you?<eos> I'm her husband!<eos> -But Sonay is not married!<eos> -Cut it out! If I say so, it is like that!<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> Deniz, go out...<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> I love you!<eos> -But, I don't love you!<eos> -You do!
I'm her husband!<eos> -But Sonay is not married!<eos> -Cut it out! If I say so, it is like that!<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> Deniz, go out...<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> I love you!<eos> -But, I don't love you!<eos> -You do!<eos> -l don't!

-Cunt!<eos> -He works in the City!<eos> Yeah, works in the fucking City, does he? Yeah!<eos> I wonder how Malcolm would be if he had some fucking nonce whispering in his ear. Explaining exactly what it is he likes doing little kids.<eos> You think he gets a lot of that, down the City.<eos> Do you think Malcolm has to watch a lot of mad cunts, cut chunks of flesh out of their own body? Get a lot of that, does he?<eos> No, wait, how about if he had some junkie, who's smacked out of his head, who's trying to bite a fucking chunk out of Malcolm's throat?<eos> And on top of that he's got some spineless governor slap him under investigation.<eos> Do you think Malcolm would like a nice fucking day at my office?<eos> Do ya?
Marry me.<eos> You know I'm not one for words.<eos> It's a good thing you only need two of them.<eos> That's me.<eos> Uh... why can't you fly down with us tonight?<eos> Candy cane wants to play.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Tickets are on top of the fridge.<eos> Flight's at 9:30.<eos> I do.
Holder...<eos> Cell calls to home, parents' phones, sterling... not much of a social life.<eos> Till that boyfriend.<eos> What was she doing with him?<eos> Good girl with no secrets.<eos> She lied to her mom about her costume... And her Fabrizio Bianchis.<eos> There's no way she could afford these.<eos> We're looking at 2gs easy.<eos> How do you even know that?<eos> How do you not?
Tommy, baby, baby, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> Right, son?<eos> Thanks for meeting me, Nathan. Yeah.<eos> Gwen tells me you, uh, had all the e-mail accounts checked.<eos> Nothing was sent to the record yesterday. I checked twice.<eos> How about Gwen, Jamie? You check their accounts?<eos> Um, I-I didn't.
Yeah, Superman costume.<eos> Cute little kid.<eos> A little kid in a Superman costume?<eos> Superman costume.<eos> Sandy hair.<eos> That's the little boy that's missing. Where did you see him?<eos> On Grand.<eos> I just passed him, like, five minutes ago.<eos> Well, we have to call that in, Kev.<eos> Yes, we do!
the human race.<eos> I know.<eos> And don't think it was hard for me... because it wasn't.<eos> All I had to do was think about my family.<eos> I just pictured them for one second, and that's all it took.<eos> You and Kate and Scott... you guys all want me to have a picture up here, but I didn't want to tell you...<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> I don't have one single photograph.<eos> I don't have a truck.<eos> I don't...

Stop it!<eos> She left me what?<eos> She left you... paintings.<eos> Paintings?<eos> Yes, his paintings.<eos> The paintings she painted, you know?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I see.<eos> She did not want to be a painter.<eos> She did it like that.
Come on!<eos> - I'm a whore!<eos> - Again!<eos> I'm a whore!<eos> Say you're a dirty whore!<eos> I'm a dirty whore!<eos> Good.<eos> What's this...?<eos> Stop it!<eos> Don't do that!
I don't care,<eos> - just... Please, let's just go.<eos> - All right, come on.<eos> Ah! Tim.<eos> Don't try and stop us.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> - Who's doing this?<eos> - I told you, but you didn't listen.<eos> Come on.<eos> They never do.
Mock if you will, but these are our future once we find a nice place.<eos> Jesus Christ, Rick!<eos> Do me a favor, man... Not today.<eos> Adam, Adam.<eos> Hey Adam, hold on.<eos> So what's cooking?<eos> This is the last of the dry rabbit that we're treated for... and we got two more of these mystery suckers left.<eos> Guys.<eos> We need to find more food.<eos> No we don't.
I don't think every Indian... ♪ Oh I wanna dance with somebody ♪<eos> Hey, Gupta.<eos> How you feeling about the competition?<eos> It's coming up pretty fast.<eos> Don't I know it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, I feel like I really rushed you into this whole thing, so if you're feeling any doubts, I mean any doubts at all, like the tiniest, smallest of doubts, like, even if you hear me say the word "doubt,"<eos> you don't have to do this.<eos> Todd, does this look like doubt to you?<eos> I don't...
It is full of gold dust<eos> Thank you<eos> We have to get out quickly<eos> !<eos> Curse<eos> What is trying to do?<eos> ... Slowed ... Do not do it<eos> Let off<eos> Let it<eos> Please do not do it
It wasn't until we...<eos> Officer Peck searched the missing persons photos that we found him.<eos> Yeah, his real name's Toma Morev.<eos> So where did "Adinocki" come from?<eos> It means "alone." I mean, he either made it up or he got mixed up.<eos> I... don't know.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> That's fine.<eos> Did he see something or not?<eos> - No, he didn't.
Contents...<eos> Melon will do.<eos> A melon.<eos> Oh, a melon.<eos> And...glasses.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You smirked.<eos> Do I look like I'm smirking?<eos> You did.
I'm just, "Fucking hell!"<eos> I honestly think that the turning point for Ozzy was Jack's sobriety.<eos> Jack learned how to deal with life sober.<eos> And I think it shamed Ozzy that he couldn't do it.<eos> He could never get it, and that's what was his big turning point in life.<eos> That was the start of the journey of him being sober.<eos> The evidence proves the fact, 'cause he hasn't drunk or abused for over five years now.<eos> I'm clean, I'm sober.<eos> I don't smoke. I don't do drugs.<eos> I don't do alcohol any more.
I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> And I'm sorry to see bloodshed return to Little Odessa.<eos> This was my slip joint pocketknife.<eos> American elk.<eos> I gave it to Mischa when he turned 18.<eos> I didn't want it back so soon.<eos> I didn't want it back ever.<eos> Do you remember the last time we sat together?<eos> Very well.<eos> I did my time.
Harvard, here we come!<eos> And, as I'm sure you know, we have a very rigorous admission process.<eos> Not everyone that applies to Our Lady of the Gulf gets in.<eos> Mr. Morgan, you were referred to us by...?<eos> Angel Batista.<eos> Uh, Sergeant Batista-- at the police station-- where we work.<eos> We, being the people that protect you in case something bad happens.<eos> Sergeant Batista's daughter went here and he recommended the school.<eos> I remember Angel.<eos> His daughter did very well here.
We tear this place apart.<eos> I want to find evidence directly linking Larssen to the shootings.<eos> I want to nail this son of a bitch.<eos> Jones?<eos> Check that plant.<eos> Bet ballistics finds a match.<eos> It's nice to see you're recovering, bud.<eos> Doctor says you'll be out of the wheelchair in the next couple days.<eos> It builds something.<eos> What does?
We'll be speaking English on set, so remember:<eos> Your opinions are welcome, so if anyone has anything to say, go ahead and say it.<eos> Alex?<eos> Oh, hello Ms Voss!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Hello. Welcome. How lovely.<eos> No problem...<eos> - I know her.<eos> I know her.<eos> - Everyone does.
She couldn't be in the house for two days until it was aired out, poor thing.<eos> Glenn told you?<eos> What did you expect?<eos> The boy has no guile.<eos> I haven't told Rick.<eos> I can't.<eos> Because of Shane?<eos> Was it that obvious?<eos> No, no, I don't think anyone knew.<eos> I didn't, not for sure.
I asked you.<eos> I told you.<eos> I just asked you for one thing. One thing.<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> My dad's gonna kick you guys out now.<eos> He told me.<eos> No, Rick's gonna work something out with your dad.<eos> - Okay? I had to tell them.<eos> - You did not.<eos> No, I did.
Detective Reagan, I haven't had a run-in with the law since a DD when I was all of 17.<eos> Actually, you were 18.<eos> The good son, huh?<eos> There's one in every Irish family.<eos> True.<eos> The point is, I don't have troubles.<eos> You know how I managed that?<eos> By staying a million miles away from my brother Rory.<eos> And for the millionth time, I don't know where he is.<eos> Well, maybe your old man does.
Are you afraid?<eos> You are afraid?<eos> You are.<eos> I see fear.<eos> Please, you're torturing me and I've got to go out.<eos> They're waiting for me.<eos> I must go to that school.<eos> Dominik!<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> You don't.
Yeah, sure.<eos> What's up?<eos> Oh, you bad girl.<eos> You know that money you gave to me to invest in my business?<eos> Yeah, what about it?<eos> Well, here's the thing.<eos> I-I know I said I was going to buy advertising...<eos> Oh, I almost forgot.<eos> I told Rose about how well you're doing for me, and now she wants in.<eos> She does?
All right.<eos> One.<eos> Rot-gut.<eos> So, uh, Kev.<eos> Just out of curiosity, do you happen to know the age of consent in Illinois?<eos> Come on, come on, pick up, pick up.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Lip and Ian have just been arrested driving a stolen car.<eos> Did they get it from you?<eos> Did they?
I don't know, if it is fake, it's perfect.<eos> Five million. It's all there.<eos> What?<eos> We could be at the airport in an hour.<eos> Faster if I put my foot down.<eos> You'd have to go back to your apartment and pack, say goodbye to your mother.<eos> The last guy got shot.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> Of course I don't.
Well, you're a little less losery, now I know you like college hoops.<eos> Hey, where's the knife guy?<eos> Is it true he's walking and talking?<eos> - What about your colectomy?<eos> - Oh, postponed.<eos> The wife snuck him a cheeseburger and fries before surgery.<eos> So this thing with Callie...<eos> I mean, you know it's a bad idea, right?<eos> You don't want to be Callie's baby's godmother.<eos> - I don't?
And then 322-340. You've compromised the security of the entire mission!<eos> Come on!<eos> 322.<eos> Okay, 324.<eos> - What the hell just happened? Gwen. Output from the I-5s goes dead without consciousness.<eos> - Oh, so she's unconscious now? - I don't know. I warned you!<eos> Gwen!<eos> Can you hear me? - It's back.<eos> - Are you all right? - Oh no. - Can you hear me?<eos> Who did this, Gwen?
I see.<eos> We old codgers have our work cut out for us, keeping spirits high at home.<eos> - Someone must.<eos> - Oh, indeed, sir.<eos> Is that Taxi Cavendish?<eos> I must catch him before I go.<eos> So Lady Sybil got off all right in the end.<eos> I'm afraid we have to admit she knows what she wants.<eos> Yes.<eos> She certainly does.
Riding camp, skiing camp.<eos> Lacrosse camp.<eos> It's like he doesn't want me around.<eos> Yeah, so you misbehave because you want a little attention.<eos> And it's so hard to make friends.<eos> Because you're insecure, so you overcompensate and come across as...<eos> As some kind of snob or...<eos> Arrogant. I get it, Anka. Ja, exactly.<eos> You know, Archer, I think you and I are a lot alike.<eos> I don't do that.
You can always suffer. It's absurd!<eos> The absurd thing is I have a gift for you too.<eos> A gift?<eos> In my office. Want to get it?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll put some music on.<eos> What is it?<eos> A group from my youth.<eos> I don't know them.<eos> Only natural. No one does.
I'm done with you.<eos> Go, run back to Winterfell!<eos> I'll have your head on a spike!<eos> I'll put it there myself, you fool!<eos> You think you're too good for this?<eos> Too proud and honorable?<eos> This is a war!<eos> I'll go ahead with my daughters.<eos> Get them ready.<eos> Do it yourself.
No, we're signing in a few so we can give 'em sedatives.<eos> That's about it.<eos> E.R.<eos> There's a survivor.<eos> - Are you leaving?<eos> - No, I didn't get fired.<eos> I know that's disappointing to you.<eos> My trial is about to disappear.<eos> You really want to act like I'm the bad guy here?<eos> - No, I don't.
Sometimes it even stops me sleeping at night.<eos> I will marry anyone you like if it helps you to sleep.<eos> Well, there's a boy. Hmm! There's a little chap.<eos> The honourable Giovanni Sforza, we welcome you to the city of Rome.<eos> Our armies are yours. Our hospitality is yours. And our sister shall soon be yours.<eos> The Sforza armies are at your service.<eos> May the union between our families bear every fruit.<eos> Please, God.<eos> Most worthy Lord, do you agree to take the illustrious Lucrezia Borgia, here present, to be your lawful spouse?<eos> I do.

I was.<eos> But it's not important.<eos> Tell me what it is.<eos> Please.<eos> He has to go a day early. Tomorrow morning, in fact.<eos> Only to meet his General, surely? Not back to France?<eos> But he must go back one day, and I can't stop thinking about what I'd do if anything happened to him.<eos> I know he'll be all right.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> None of us do.
Says the genius who got a hooker pregnant.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Cyril, what? - Noth...<eos> Cyril?<eos> You dead?<eos> - Damn.<eos> - Should I put him out of his misery?<eos> - No.<eos> Do you, though.
Yeah, that sounds about right.<eos> Great, now he's gonna be moping around like Droopy Dawg on downers for...<eos> Morning, gang!<eos> Jeez Archer, what's got your mom so darn worked up?<eos> This!<eos> Krieger?<eos> And the damn thing is spreading!<eos> To every computer in the office!<eos> Do you think this is funny?<eos> ! Do you not?
Santa only comes to boys and girls who go to bed early.<eos> You won't forget to leave out carrots for Rudolph?<eos> Okay Warren.<eos> Do you not answer your phone now?<eos> Sorry, I'm seeing Santy with Warren.<eos> What's the story?<eos> Fran the man's misses is after topping herself.<eos> Didyouhearme?<eos> Yeah. So he's going to be coming out of whatever hole he was hiding in.<eos> What did she do?
I mean...maybe he's the one who killed her.<eos> His voice, did you recognize it?<eos> No.<eos> What were they arguing about?<eos> "How could you do this to me?<eos> You have no right.<eos> Who do you think you are?" Stuff like that.<eos> It kinda sounded like he was her boyfriend. So that was Amber's dad.<eos> He said he didn't know anything about a boyfriend.<eos> Neither did any of the other girls.
He said you chose the restaurant.<eos> I don't know where to eat around here.<eos> He suggested a few places and we decided on this one.<eos> So how about the waiter-- the waiter who you asked where somebody would go if they wanted to smoke?<eos> Lance smoked, didn't he?<eos> What's that prove?<eos> I'll tell you what it proves.<eos> It proves everything that Margaret is saying-- that you wanted to be with her and you wanted to have Lance's money, too.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.<eos> Do you?
-Do you have bottles of red?<eos> -Could I have a red wine?<eos> Does everyone want red wine?<eos> You've insulted me and all Native Americans!<eos> -This wine is corked.<eos> -No, it is not corked.<eos> It's from a box, OK?<eos> I think I know what you need, Bente.<eos> -Really?<eos> -Yes, I do.
Relax!<eos> The money's totally safe, on deposit with the casino.<eos> - Wh...<eos> - That way they comp everything.<eos> I call it the Sterling Archer Triple-A Power Play, and yes,<eos> - the A stands for awesome.<eos> - Did you get a receipt?<eos> Of course, I did.<eos> Obviously...<eos> I did that.
He's been dead all along.<eos> Travis, you killed Gellar.<eos> Miami Metro Homicide.<eos> That's where God wants us to stage Wormwood.<eos> Dex, you saved a lot of lives today.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Every time the shit hits the fan, I go to him.<eos> He's your safe place.<eos> You're making it sound like I want to be with him or something.<eos> Well, do you?
- 18. And 7 victims rescued.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, stop that vehicle!<eos> Stop! Where you going? !<eos> Stop!<eos> They were gonna take me away.<eos> We need to get you some help. I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> We know what happened here.<eos> No, you don't.
You stabbed me!<eos> I'll go for a kill.<eos> You have 10 seconds to run.<eos> - 1, 2...<eos> - I'll kill you!<eos> 3, 4, 5... 6, 7, 8, 9 Ten!<eos> "Kaneko Loans"<eos> Sumida!<eos> You have the money?<eos> Well, do you?
You're gonna need a bone marrow transplant.<eos> No.<eos> A marrow transplant does leave you exposed to all sorts of illnesses, but there really is no choice here.<eos> She doesn't have radiation poisoning.<eos> She's getting better.<eos> We need to start your treatment before it's too late.<eos> No.<eos> You're either suicidal or you know we're wrong.<eos> And the only way you could know for sure what wasn't killing her is if you knew what was.<eos> And you do, don't you?
Are we building 200 galleys now?<eos> We have to build 300, or even 400 of them.<eos> Egypt is ours.<eos> But the Rhodians command the Mediterranean.<eos> The earliest we can start this campaign is in spring.<eos> Perhaps even later.<eos> But even if we can't capture Rhodes right away it would be good if we start stirring things up from the inside.<eos> If you can't beat them, frustrate them?<eos> I am not saying that.<eos> Aristotle does.
A little further on... is Jan Huygen.<eos> There are always Flemish regulars.<eos> We can't pass that by.<eos> There's always a familiar face.<eos> We have plenty of time.<eos> And plenty of money.<eos> Then I want to go to the baker... in Kalverstraat... for some currant bread.<eos> I want to go tomorrow... in Amsterdam.<eos> Tomorrow...<eos> We all do, Oene.
What do you photograph?<eos> Places, roads, ports, things like that.<eos> You enjoy it?<eos> They say... they're places many people pass through, they say they have no soul.<eos> I don't agree.<eos> You never photograph people?<eos> Hardly ever.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> I worked all day.<eos> What do you do?
Uh, Meredith, can I see you in my office?<eos> Well, that was very... inspirational.<eos> Thank you, chief.<eos> Nobody gets married thinking it's gonna fail.<eos> Well, you're the one who needed the big wedding.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means, if we still had our savings, my being laid off wouldn't be such a big deal.<eos> No, we decided on that together.<eos> We both wanted that wedding.<eos> No, we didn't.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Ed.<eos> You're not the biggest crook I've been seen in public with, Louis.<eos> Wish I could say the same about you.<eos> Are we shocking your youthful sensibilities?<eos> I've heard worse, sir.<eos> Jimmy went up against the Kaiser for two years.<eos> Oh, that's a rough patch of road.<eos> That was only war.<eos> This is Atlantic City.<eos> Well done, boy.

After they make millions off the fucking monkey merchandise?<eos> - I say we move now. I'm telling you.<eos> - Well, I disagree.<eos> Good thing is you passed me on to him, so I don't care what you think.<eos> - I disagree too. - Oh really?<eos> Then you're fired.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> - No no, didn't I tell you in your office?<eos> Nobody fucks with Dice.<eos> Dice does the fucking.
- What have you found?<eos> - Not the killer, but a possible witness.<eos> Here you see Patrik Högberg in his car.<eos> The time is 21:54:14.<eos> He gets out, looks around, as if he's waiting for someone.<eos> He looks at the clock and things like that.<eos> There.<eos> He sees something or someone and goes out of the picture.<eos> - When does he come back?<eos> - He doesn't.
-Focus, Lloyd.<eos> -l'm trying, Ari, but this all has me very rattled.<eos> Mr. Gold!<eos> How are you?<eos> -Uh, table for two?<eos> -Actually no, James.<eos> I have a question for you.<eos> Did you see my wife this morning?<eos> Oh, I didn't work this morning.<eos> Uh, David did.
-Off the show.<eos> -The show hasn't even aired yet.<eos> Yeah, but we've already won.<eos> You heard Phil.<eos> After they exploit our voices and sell 1 0 million of them fucking monkeys<eos> -without giving us a dime...<eos> -You're fucking with me, right?<eos> No.<eos> You know what I say?<eos> We do the fucking.

-without giving us a dime...<eos> -You're fucking with me, right?<eos> No.<eos> You know what I say?<eos> We do the fucking.<eos> Me and you, Drama, we do the fucking.<eos> -Let's talk to our people.<eos> -You know what?<eos> First we talk and then we walk.<eos> Drama, we do the fucking!
Heh.<eos> Maybe some dead hair.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> You are looking at the mall queen.<eos> I can give you a guided tour.<eos> Maybe even today after school?<eos> We could take Tessa to all of Dalia's favorite shops.<eos> Oh, she will love it.<eos> And she'll love Dalia.<eos> Everybody does.
You're an artist.<eos> Yeah, that's me, but Regina doesn't know I have it.<eos> So...<eos> It's my dad's, whoever that is.<eos> You see the parking sticker in the windshield?<eos> I thought it might tell me where he lived or worked.<eos> Yeah, I tried.<eos> I tried blowing it up, but it just got all blurry.<eos> You don't know how to enlarge the image and, like, sharpen it, do you?<eos> You do?
Yeah, a little.<eos> I'd like to finish early, 'cuz I gotta work on my script.<eos> I like how you compared Labradors to moviegoers.<eos> - Labrador... No, I just... - Really.<eos> - At the same time... - It's the archetypical animal.<eos> Yeah. But you see... honestly... I think Labradors represent moviegoers pretty well.<eos> It's pretty big, yet short at the same time.<eos> You see?<eos> - I could have said a poodle.<eos> - But you didn't.
When was the last time you rode this thing?<eos> I think I had hair.<eos> Is that Gemma's meatloaf? Yeah.<eos> I-I missed this almost as much as I missed pussy.<eos> You all right?<eos> Not really.<eos> Look, look, look, I know.<eos> Just, just get behind Clay on this cartel, man.<eos> He wants you there.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Come on.<eos> It's only a cover.<eos> Who's number three?<eos> How about you, Peter?<eos> I mean, you seem like the marrying kind, right?<eos> I am married.<eos> Hey... It's only a cover.<eos> Be nice to give her some variety.<eos> Unless -- Guys, guys, unless, you know, you need permission.<eos> I don't -
A case.<eos> Pro bono. One of your very own.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Louis knows.<eos> Louis knows what?<eos> My dirty little secret.<eos> You're Canadian?<eos> He knows that I didn't go to Harvard.<eos> No, he doesn't.
She ordered me to kill you.<eos> Because you wanted her out of your life.<eos> You wanted to throw away all those years she spent with you.<eos> In exchange, she'II kill the bastard I married.<eos> please don't kill me.<eos> Get up.<eos> Now!<eos> Get dressed.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> Do it!
I-I don't believe in attacking people online and spreading rumors.<eos> Neither do I, which is why I wanna take Gossip Girl down.<eos> How?<eos> Everyone reads her, and whether they admit it or not, everyone posts.<eos> This city is addicted to her.<eos> Only because she writes about people like you.<eos> Think about it.<eos> If you and your friends are the main reason people care about Gossip Girl, and starting tomorrow, everyone can read about you straight from the source, that would make "Gossip Girl" irrelevant, wouldn't it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
His wife, Lisa Farragaut, she's an old friend of my sister.<eos> I gotta make the call, Jack.<eos> Yeah, I'll be there in a few.<eos> Okay, just promise me that you're going to let me pay the next time.<eos> This is not a freebie.<eos> There's a guy I want you to meet.<eos> Okay, I'm giving you cash right now.<eos> He's divorced, he has a daughter Nicky's age, looks like the guy on Mad Men.<eos> Ooh, poor girl.<eos> No, he does.
If anything could do it, it would be Luann.<eos> We got to end this.<eos> Today.<eos> Get a 20 on Georgie.<eos> I got to head up to Unser's.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just got to lock down a truck for the next shipment.<eos> You got to do it now?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm off him until he starts treating me better.<eos> In fact, you should probably take a page out of my book, if I'm being honest.<eos> Actually, I'd rather talk about this.<eos> I'm curious why you and Klaus have spent a thousand years running from your father.<eos> I should get back to the girls.<eos> Homecoming's right around the corner.<eos> Well, then maybe I'll ask Mikael when we wake him.<eos> Heh. You're bluffing.<eos> You don't know where he is.<eos> No one does.
Great.<eos> A shop in Montana, about a day and a half, maybe two days from here.<eos> - So?<eos> - So?<eos> So, why are you still talking to me?<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> Yep.<eos> Where's Bobby?<eos> - He take off? - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Sam, how you doing?
I don't decide Dean's guilt.<eos> I just weigh the guilt that's already there.<eos> This is solely about how Dean feels, way down deep.<eos> - Them's the breaks.<eos> So, if Dean believes he's innocent, then he is?<eos> "If." A big "if."<eos> Why do I bring up the past?<eos> To see if he feels like dog food about it.<eos> People want to be judged.<eos> They really do.
I got one of the big mouths downstairs.<eos> So I won't go downstairs.<eos> I, uh...<eos> - I wanted to come thank you.<eos> - Thank me?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Seeing as they were fresh out of... "thanks for saving me from liver-eating surgeon" cards at the store.<eos> Oh, that. Just doing my job, which nobody pays me for.<eos> Right.<eos> How you doing, Bobby?
Just pay for the soda next time you come in.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, you need to march me inside and make me pay now.<eos> - Mrs. Delfino...<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> Make an example of me to deter other criminals.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Take her in.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Yep, did the crime, doing the time.
Dave.<eos> When did you have the Hopkins kid dig him up?<eos> I had no idea any of this would happen.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I picked Kyle to dig him up three weeks ago.<eos> You did this without even talking to me.<eos> Well, you wouldn't have agreed.<eos> Damn right.<eos> We need Garland back.<eos> No, we don't.
Katia, translate what it says.<eos> Alright.<eos> If you translate word by word ... is an agreement on intelligence work.<eos> - An assignment in writing? - You can express so.<eos> Zhora Linko.<eos> It is illogical.<eos> - I bet.<eos> - What does this mean?<eos> What is an agent Linko the service of SD.<eos> And here, what else does?
I'm... sure he does.<eos> But I don't think pheasants.<eos> Mr Murray thinks a reference from an earl will go in my favor.<eos> I'm not sure such things matter when it comes to murder.<eos> I think it will help.<eos> Because you want to think so.<eos> Anna, you must prepare for the worst.<eos> I'm not saying it will happen, but you must prepare for it.<eos> I know it could happen.<eos> I do.
He always wanted to work with animals.<eos> Horses really.<eos> But his mother saw him as a butler.<eos> Lording it over a great house.<eos> He loved you both so much.<eos> I'm only grateful his mother went first.<eos> She couldn't have borne it.<eos> No, but she would have had to face it, wouldn't she? Like you.<eos> We all have to face the truth, don't we?<eos> We do, lass.
Don't ever go behind my back again.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Wait. He called you?<eos> Yeah. He left a message.<eos> What did he say?<eos> That he wanted to see me.<eos> And what did you do?<eos> I texted him and I told him I wasn't interested.<eos> We've got to tell him.<eos> No, we don't.

He's good, very good.<eos> He can be a little douchey... but he's a good guy, and a very good surgeon.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Meredith, uh...<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I never meant for any of this to...<eos> I know what you wanted to do for me.<eos> - But...<eos> - I do.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights as I have explained them to you?<eos> Aah.<eos> I didn't know who she was.<eos> I didn't kill her!<eos> I never even saw the girl.<eos> I didn't know she was on the island.<eos> Who'd have thought?<eos> He always seemed like such a nice man.<eos> Mm.<eos> He did, didn't he?
There's no junk jiggling. We just talk. Are you sane?<eos> With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> (chuckles) Well, if you don't, you're gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.<eos> How can you be so racist?<eos> Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.<eos> Oh, Leonard, good. There you are.<eos> I need you to check my head for chair lice.<eos> I did it last night, I'm not doing it again. Just his head, right? I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Yes, I did.
You mean like Salt Lake City?<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'll talk to Penny. Thank you.<eos> Will you listen to me play my harp now? No.<eos> I dislike the sound of the harp.<eos> Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think<eos> (plays glissando)<eos> I'm sorry, Mommy.<eos> Don't be mad at me.<eos> Don't do that!
She's just a whore, Mick.<eos> Well, then go talk to her, you bastard.<eos> Make me a liar.<eos> Go on.<eos> Good morning to ya.<eos> He buy the man a drink first, that's what I hear.<eos> He buy the man a drink, take him out and goes savage as a meat axe on him, you hear me?<eos> He didn't kill Johnson.<eos> They was gonna hang him.<eos> They didn't.
All righty, well he seems to be all done now.<eos> You have a good evening...<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> He must have gotten into the chicken feed again.<eos> You'd think they'd know it wasn't in their diet, but this is how they find out.<eos> You may want to close your mouth.<eos> Meg, what's wrong?<eos> Eli's father, Ezekiel, said that I can't see him anymore!<eos> He said I was trying to corrupt his son!<eos> He did, did he?
Is that right?<eos> She was fucking someone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So what exactly are we doing?<eos> Well, I'd like a drink.<eos> Or three.<eos> All right, swanky or hole-in-the-wall?<eos> I don't like the word "hole" anymore.<eos> Right.<eos> But I do like a good dive.
- So fucking stupid.<eos> - Just try to make yourself calm.<eos> - You had everything going.<eos> - Breathe, Nuck.<eos> Your whole life.<eos> You'll get through it.<eos> All you got to worry about is when you run out of booze and you run out of company<eos> and the only person left to judge you is your...<eos> You don't know me, James.<eos> You never did.
What does it mean?<eos> Well, I would assume it means they wanna have a threesome.<eos> - Definitely.<eos> - Wow, how do I handle this?<eos> Depends.<eos> If you're into it, send a dick pic back.<eos> I'm gonna have to sleep on this one.<eos> Moran?<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - No, we don't!
I know that.<eos> All right, give us a minute.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Found him at Oswald's.<eos> Trying to hide the evidence.<eos> Sons don't kill themselves.<eos> Club's gonna vote him out.<eos> No one's gonna trust him.<eos> I know.<eos> But you do?
They made you, Nikita.<eos> They're the only family you ever had.<eos> Yes.<eos> You can reach inside you.<eos> Embrace it.<eos> Yes, do it.<eos> Finish the mission.<eos> - Finish the mission.<eos> - Shut up. Finish the mission!<eos> Do it!
This is not your house anymore, bromigo.<eos> This is my house.<eos> And my party's over when I say it's over.<eos> Get off me, Larry.<eos> Larry? !<eos> ♪ When they speaking my name ♪<eos> - Oh, Ohh... yeahh! - No.<eos> Shit!<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Actually, we don't.
Man, she's got a Facebook group?<eos> My first cop flashlight.<eos> Can't wait to get some brains on this bad boy.<eos> Are you safe, ma'am? Everything okay?<eos> Is this guy bothering you?<eos> - Huh? Huh?<eos> - Hey!<eos> Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> The badge says to serve and protect!<eos> No, it doesn't.
Oh.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Yes?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> I'm, uh, just looking.<eos> An espresso machine would be nice.<eos> Oh, hey. The release went well?<eos> It did.
I was stuck in the O.R. all day, trying not to fall behind in my surgeries.<eos> Oh, so you'd rather just fall behind in my opinion of you?<eos> I will take care of it right away.<eos> It's hard to be a team when only one player cares, Kepner.<eos> Now we removed all the old hardware, and we're all set to implant the cage tomorrow.<eos> So just try to get some rest, okay?<eos> Oh, well, I'm gonna stay the night and make sure, uh, he's got some company.<eos> I'll stay.<eos> I-I-I don't need the rest.<eos> A-and I do?
Thanks, Canada. We're looking for a food the average American eats.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah. - Oh!<eos> Chinese food.<eos> Hey, remember when we were arguing about the most popular food?<eos> It's bread.<eos> Hm. And the barroom debate was dead.<eos> You guys are idiots!<eos> Okay, not completely dead. You are seriously telling me you don't want to open that envelope and find out if you're having a boy or a girl?<eos> Nope. Dr. Sonya only gave us this in case we wanted to know.<eos> But we don't.
Tetsuo, you don't have - a girlfriend? - No.<eos> Here it is.<eos> - Oh, yes, please.<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> - Hey, it's OK. Come with us.<eos> - No, I don't want to.<eos> Come on. It's near here.<eos> It doesn't take much time.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Please don't.
They already decided.<eos> - I'm sorry, what?<eos> I didn't get the job here.<eos> I turned down my other job because I thought I had this, and now...<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> - Well, who told you you didn't get this?<eos> - The hiring committee.<eos> They called.<eos> Well, there must be some sort of mistake, because I haven't decided yet.<eos> No, they did.
You can have whatever you want.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn't have hair on your chest.<eos> I know, it filled in last year.<eos> I didn't get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.<eos> And whose fault was that?<eos> Yours.<eos> Shelly, you're not eight years old anymore.<eos> We have to have a different relationship.<eos> No, we don't.
It's... hard to say why artists... paint what they do.<eos> Gosh, that probably sounded so... artsy.<eos> No, not really.<eos> I would imagine it's even possible that the artist herself doesn't really know why she did it.<eos> Sometimes you say to yourself...<eos> "Where the heck did that come from?"<eos> "Maybe I shouldn't have eaten" "that pepperoni pizza before bed."<eos> Or maybe you say to yourself,<eos> "I feel so guilty about what I did."<eos> I-I-I don't...
Police.<eos> Someone reported hearing the beating here.<eos> Open the door!<eos> Quick!<eos> Open up!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Don't live like this.<eos> You'll regret it.<eos> I wish they weren't hurt...<eos> I really do...
We'll just go by her work, you walk in and introduce yourself.<eos> And then what?<eos> Pretend I need glasses like Samuel did?<eos> Please.<eos> He ended up not getting a date and looking like African Urkel.<eos> Well, at least he doesn't walk up to strange women in bars and tell them they're under arrest for disturbing the pants.<eos> Why are you so interested in my love life all of a sudden?<eos> I just think the right woman is out there for you, Carl, but she's not hanging from a pole or lifting her shirt at a bears game.<eos> Hey, your bachelor days may be dead and buried, but don't grab me with your zombie hand and drag me into your sad-ass grave.<eos> Hey, Molly, how you doing, cutie? Hey, Carl.
You know, have someplace go every day?<eos> And do what?<eos> Sweep hair at the Supercuts?<eos> Read to the geezers at the old folks' home?<eos> Hand out samples of summer sausage to the moochers at the grocery store?<eos> All I'm saying is, you still got a lot to offer.<eos> I am good with people.<eos> You do have a gift.<eos> Hey, do you need any help around the police station? No!<eos> We do not.
Well, maybe Mom should marry him.<eos> - She did. - We weren't supposed to tell you.<eos> Your mother remarried?<eos> Hey, Grampa, you gonna build a snowman?<eos> No, I just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke.<eos> Dad, can you take the boys out for a while?<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> Thanks for spending so much time with us, Dad.<eos> Who wants to go the park and ride the merry-go-nowhere?<eos> I do, I do!
Kalinda, where are you going next?<eos> The foreman-- he seemed open to talking.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Stay in touch.<eos> Uh, you, too, Alicia.<eos> And, Alicia, uh, let's talk when you get back.<eos> O-Okay.<eos> Well, I do hope you consider moving back to the neighborhood.<eos> I'd love to, but you know civil servant pay.<eos> Oh, my goodness, I do.
He looked a little sad.<eos> Let's talk about it another time.<eos> Maybe never.<eos> By the way, I've canceled all appointments, rescheduled them to next week.<eos> - But that's my job.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So, what did you tell them?<eos> I said, my secretary disappeared in a perverted Jane Austen world.<eos> Sure, you said that.<eos> You did?
- Downbeat?<eos> - The downbeat.<eos> In the music.<eos> Is it...?<eos> One-two-three-one-two...<eos> Heyyy.<eos> - Why did you do that?<eos> - It's not the first time I drive people here.<eos> You won't come in there with this bottle.<eos> But I do.
Louis will rest like my grandfather and my father in our family tomb in Brittany.<eos> I never told him how much I loved him.<eos> I thought we had plenty of time.<eos> - They let you go.<eos> - They had no proof.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I want my child.<eos> Sita chose to raise him with me!<eos> Sita didn't choose!<eos> Her father did!
We'll be lucky to find an oil spot.<eos> How long is this gonna take?<eos> How would I know? I can't be late.<eos> I don't know why you're going at all.<eos> That guy is bad company. He's a manipulative prick.<eos> He manipulated us out of jail, didn't he?<eos> Now he fucking owns us.<eos> I got a tongue like... Like a towel. Want a beer?<eos> Do I want a beer?<eos> No, I do not.
These are just scouts.<eos> If we let them leave, they'll come back with more and there will be no survivors.<eos> That's what they did to my people.<eos> I came here to make sure it would not happen again, but we have to work together.<eos> He says his people will join her.<eos> Join her? What's she going to do?<eos> Where you going to go?<eos> We can find them.<eos> He knows where they are.<eos> No, I don't.
Monsieur de Charlus had distracted me from noting if the bumblebee had pollinated the orchid.<eos> What I had witnessed was a miracle of sorts, of almost the same type, and just as amazing.<eos> Still, I was disappointed, as I had missed out on the flower's pollination by the bumblebee.<eos> Oriane is getting dressed. My wife is impossible!<eos> She asked Swann to bring his Maltese knights proofs, just as we're about to go out.<eos> - It's nice of you to have come.<eos> - I came to ask the duchess if the Princess of Guermantes had truly invited me.<eos> It's too late!<eos> We no longer wish to get involved in their guest list. I don't even know if we shall attend.<eos> Do me a favor: not a word to Oriane on this subject, please.
All right.<eos> Mr. Aaron?<eos> Yes, Becky...<eos> Lisa?<eos> Are you still mad at me about the test?<eos> What's going on, Lisa?<eos> Because maybe the bus driver is completely devastated as it is, and I'm just gonna be this rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience.<eos> What does your being rich have to do with anything?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> No, I don't.
Nothing.<eos> I'm having dinner with Darcy. She said it was important.<eos> It's important?<eos> Oh, my God, should I be there?<eos> Rachel is here.<eos> - Rach, we're back here. - A bit short.<eos> Do you wanna sit down?<eos> No, that's okay.<eos> I thought that we were having dinner alone, Darce.<eos> - Right. - So did I.
"was the first animal to orbit the Earth.<eos> "She was launched into outer space<eos> "on the 3rd of November, 1957.<eos> "Scientists believed humans would be unable<eos> "to survive conditions of outer space,<eos> "so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor<eos> "to human missions.<eos> "Her rocket was not designed to be retrievable,<eos> "and Laika had always been intended to die."<eos> But she didn't, did she?
Alice, meet me under the gazebo in precisely 1 0 minutes.<eos> We have a secret to tell you.<eos> If you're telling me, then it's not much of a secret.<eos> -Perhaps we shouldn't.<eos> -We decided we should.<eos> If we tell her, she won't be surprised.<eos> -Will you be surprised?<eos> -Not if you tell me.<eos> But now you've brought it up, you have to.<eos> -No, we don't.
It's an account, that's all.<eos> I know the bank well.<eos> They'll work with me.<eos> But you still need her signature, of course.<eos> When it comes to money, sport, your eyes suddenly shine, just like mine.<eos> Great!<eos> Saved another life?<eos> Asshole!<eos> Are you crazy? You want to die?<eos> How do we do this?
-Nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> -Good night.<eos> -Good night.<eos> Where are you two going?<eos> What, nobody around here believes in comebacks?<eos> Winn, I owe you something.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I never did.
I haven't seen one of those since the '90s.<eos> Yeah, I got it back east.<eos> -Still work? -Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Just need it charged. Can you do that for me?<eos> Give me a...<eos> I got cables. I don't need the cables.<eos> I can put a trickle charger on it, though, for you.<eos> I mean, if you got the coin.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, I do.
I had no idea you were married.<eos> And who was your friend with the cigarette case?<eos> A question for a question.<eos> Well, it's like poker.<eos> You have to pay to see my hand.<eos> What game are we playing, Mr. Soames?<eos> - Leni. - I thought you'd left.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Leni Mueller, this is Mrs. Anthony Lan-Ting.<eos> How do you do?
No, no, not with her unfortunately. I just ran into her at the same restaurant, the Casanova.<eos> Are you married, Mr. Soames?<eos> I was. A long time ago.<eos> My wife ran off with another man two days before we were due to leave for Shanghai.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did yours break your heart?<eos> From what I remember.<eos> Women always win in the end.<eos> They forget us more easily.<eos> Mine certainly did that.
Let me see. I... I don't know.<eos> - Not a hard question.<eos> - He's walking away.<eos> So... jeans and... belts.<eos> You have a rash or something spreading on your neck.<eos> Well, you know, I asked him to do a piece on Trump.<eos> And he actually picked up my Diet Coke and hurled it across the room.<eos> - Wow, he picked it up.<eos> - Just missed me.<eos> He did.
Continue with them, even when you travel.<eos> Next week, come for a follicle checkup.<eos> In two weeks, we can start the artificial insemination process.<eos> Your partner needs to come with you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm too scared to watch.<eos> You'll soon be doing this yourself.<eos> I'd like to see our old house before I die.<eos> Why don't you go see it?<eos> Why don't you?
You fool! Idiot!<eos> Ruined my clothes!<eos> Ammi ... Ammi ... Ammi ...<eos> Zakir is sleeping.<eos> What's this?<eos> 'Kill time.' - How did you get so wet?<eos> 'Kill time.' I want to 'kill time.'<eos> - What?<eos> Abdul Workshop asked me to go home and 'kill time.'<eos> How do I do that?
I have no problem with Christians or the Jews.<eos> In fact, I have no problems with our Hindu brothers too.<eos> I treat a lot of Hindu patients in St. Benedict's hospital.<eos> I get angry only when this same grace is not reciprocated towards us Muslims.<eos> My blood boils when Israeli Jews massacre our Palestinian brothers.<eos> Or when Hindus in India cut our women and children to pieces with their swords.<eos> That's when my blood boils.<eos> Doesn't your blood boil?<eos> Answer me. Doesn't your blood boil?<eos> - It does. It does.

Really? That was a good time to go get something?<eos> Well, yeah, it was, actually.<eos> I was getting this.<eos> You big idiot.<eos> I wouldn't be holding this ring if it weren't for you.<eos> I reject your proposal.<eos> I don't want to not make plans with you.<eos> I want to make plans with you.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Turn around.<eos> Hurry it up!<eos> I want ten.<eos> Come on, follow me!<eos> Let's get out of here!<eos> Who taught you to fight?<eos> - It's a gift from God.<eos> - Sure, God.<eos> Want to work?<eos> - Doing what?
Don't worry about it.<eos> Can we take it slow?<eos> I'm sorry, it's just that...<eos> I just got out of a long relationship, and I don't want to go from just having sex to just having sex to just having sex.<eos> Who's the third "just having sex"?<eos> You, if we had sex.<eos> Okay, then who's the second?<eos> A guy I met at this gallery thing.<eos> You slept with him?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yeah?<eos> Do you think?<eos> I don't think we would've.<eos> I don't know, it was a big relationship for me.<eos> So, you're a carpenter now?<eos> Yeah. I was always good at making things, so...<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Beth, I made you that bed. Don't you remember?<eos> It was why we were going to buy the mattress to begin with.<eos> Yes, I do.
Fuck off, Jerry!<eos> Tonight's not good, man.<eos> Man, you gotta come!<eos> I can't believe you lied to me about your dinner.<eos> Put on AC/DC!<eos> It's actually a pretty fun party.<eos> Man, I can't!<eos> All right. I got to go.<eos> We wanna hear AC/DC!<eos> Don't, okay?
Am I?<eos> Am I dreaming?<eos> Come here.<eos> Sit with me.<eos> I need to tell you-<eos> I know, Matthew.<eos> I know this wasn't your fault.<eos> You tried to help me.<eos> I did.<eos> I really really did.
She even likes you more than me.<eos> She wanted me to ask if there was some way we could switch.<eos> "Switch"?<eos> Yeah, switch.<eos> Are you really attached to Dorothee?<eos> Uhh...<eos> Of course!<eos> I like Dorothee.<eos> But if Amber really wants me, then ... yeah.<eos> Yeah, she does!
Now in France, they say the word "stick" like this, bâton.<eos> We got some of Kick-Ass's bâtons.<eos> We're gonna show you what they can do.<eos> Go ahead, boys.<eos> In America, we say "stick" like this.<eos> Baseball bat.<eos> Which is very good for hitting knees and stomachs.<eos> It's also good for hitting balls.<eos> Know what else we do? We don't do them individually.<eos> We do them all together.
- Badly.<eos> She felt rejected and...<eos> That's how her inferiority complex began.<eos> She got a complex because your father didn't touch her up?<eos> She should have been grateful.<eos> That didn't last long, less than a year.<eos> Are you crying?<eos> You can cry if you want.<eos> The thing is I don't cry.<eos> - You don't?
Put her... put her in the tent for a moment, okay?<eos> He's here?<eos> - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.<eos> - It's a blessing.<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> - One more heal.<eos> - It's not happening. No.<eos> I'm sorry. It doesn't always happen.<eos> Doesn't always work. - Doesn't always work.<eos> It doesn't...
- On the level?<eos> - He's as big as they come.<eos> Christ, Luciano's sitting on a half a million.<eos> I know that for a fact.<eos> Got a spread on Park Avenue.<eos> You make that much running card games?<eos> Cards, hijacking.<eos> He's a fucking dope peddler, too.<eos> Did six months for pushing heroin a couple years back.<eos> But he only did six months?
- No, it isn't.<eos> No. You look great.<eos> Fantastic. I...<eos> I'm going to change.<eos> I'm going to change, and I'm going to take a shower.<eos> - We don't wanna miss the movie.<eos> - How about no movie?<eos> How about I am taking you to dinner in the city?<eos> - We don't have to do that.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I think we both know that's not gonna happen, Mr. Tripplehorn, or should I say,<eos> Phil Foster.<eos> Next time you make a dinner reservation, don't use the same alias as your ransom notes, you dick.<eos> Ransom note?<eos> Listen, we are just a regular, boring couple from New Jersey.<eos> - Let's just get this done.<eos> - Get what done?<eos> What do you want?<eos> You know what we want.<eos> - We don't actually. We really don't.
A decade ago. Everyone had hear of Anton 'The Pro' Protopov.<eos> Let's get out of here!<eos> He was 18 all when he threw a fight.<eos> Took a dive... for a prize.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Ow. Shit!<eos> Skinny Faddeev, The boss of the Russian mob, Los Angeles.<eos> - Don't be an asshole.<eos> - We know who Faddeev is.<eos> Of course you do.
- Spark plugs?<eos> - Spark plugs.<eos> Jews invented spark plugs to control global traffic.<eos> Right, everybody calm down.<eos> We're gonna grab the gear and walk.<eos> All right, but check the roofs, boys.<eos> There could still be an ambush.<eos> Careful, careful with that.<eos> Watch out.<eos> Easy does it.
She decides she wants to learn tennis, she learns tennis!<eos> She goes to all the matches, practices every day, she develops a nice backhand.<eos> Her goddamn instructor moved in with us one summer.<eos> And then one day, she decides tennis is a dull sport, a game for spoiled aristocrats, and she wants nothing more to do with it.<eos> Last summer, it was dragonflies.<eos> She was obsessed with the things.<eos> Studied them, painted them, took courses on them, and then one day, poof.<eos> No more dragonflies.<eos> Yeah, I didn't even know she liked dragonflies.<eos> Well, she doesn't, Sam.
Everything is going to be OK.<eos> But I don't want to go to Egypt.<eos> He has never said a word to me.<eos> Hadil, Miss Hind is ready to see you. Don't worry.<eos> It will be all right.<eos> Tell me, Hadil, do you want to leave the school, marry your cousin and move to Egypt?<eos> Of course she does.<eos> Look, she is shy.<eos> What do you say, Hadil?<eos> No, I don't, Mama Hind.
It was going to be...wow<eos> - Snap, Crackle and Pop<eos> (studying out loud)<eos> Excuse me, princess rita<eos> Are you just going to sit there or are you going to help me?<eos> No, Mr. Feder said that I must study for the big final<eos> - What final?<eos> - You tell me! He just keeps handing me books<eos> did you pack the adapters for Italy?<eos> Yes, I did In L.A.
Yes, sure.<eos> No, but I sent you one.<eos> Do you always take him with you?<eos> No, I'm taking him to the vet.<eos> is he ill?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So why to the vet?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm supposed to drive him there.<eos> So why don't you?
You're?<eos> You wanna come in with me?<eos> No, this is as close as I wanna get to another coffin.<eos> When you get ready to go back to work, you come by my office.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I might need a day or so.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look.<eos> Hey, who are you?<eos> What you doing here?
- And Ryan.<eos> - Are you playing with me?<eos> - I'm fixing to.<eos> I sure do love you, Miss Prissy.<eos> Adela's "my sweet Lord" cookies.<eos> I had them when I was knee-high.<eos> Oh, she had a line at her table.<eos> She said she's gonna make you a batch for when you're out of there.<eos> - She said that?<eos> - Yeah, she did.
Dad!<eos> Aimo!<eos> Piiparinen!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> As long as the kids are here, the elves won't leave the hangar.<eos> It's either me or Santa.<eos> I suggest Santa.<eos> It's Piiparinen.<eos> Pietari, do you read?<eos> I do.
I want to know how he is.<eos> - I want to see Dad.<eos> - Don't call him Dad.<eos> - He's not here now.<eos> - But it bothers me too, OK?<eos> Tommaso, come here!<eos> No, here.<eos> - Who's out there? - Nobody.<eos> - People know what happened?<eos> - No, they don't.
Tired of what?<eos> Them?<eos> A little bit of everything.<eos> You are coarse!<eos> I like you too, ma'am.<eos> Listen...<eos> I want to ask you something, something personal.<eos> Tommaso has told me that you're very close friends.<eos> Did he tell you about Antonio, about what happened?<eos> - Yes, he did.
Where is the tough guy?<eos> He left us.<eos> He's here.<eos> Run!<eos> Run! Run! Run!<eos> You set us up.<eos> He led us into that death camp, then hid and waited for that thing to strike.<eos> We were bait.<eos> I needed to know who we were up against.<eos> Now I do.
Help me.<eos> I'm one of you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on. Do it.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Kill me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do it now.
I had a bit of a bad day.<eos> My car broke down. It had to be towed away.<eos> They said it wasn't worth repairing. They gave me 20 quid for it.<eos> - That's not much. - No.<eos> What can you do with 20 quid?<eos> I bought myself a bottle of champagne.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you finish it?<eos> Yeah, I did. Huh.
Nice... I'll get it!<eos> Hey, we have time for...<eos> - She always gets there first.<eos> - You can answer next time. I promise.<eos> It's for you.<eos> - Leena speaking.<eos> - Hello, Leena...<eos> It's me, your mother.<eos> - Do you give up?<eos> - Do you?
Let's go.<eos> I'm sure President Taylor's gonna be very interested to find out what happened to my informant when I tried to deliver him to you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Cole tried to secure that landing zone with more men, but instead you sent a drone, which failed to detect the missile that killed my informant and two of your men.<eos> Cole hasn't said anything about it.<eos> And neither will I, as long as you let me pursue this.<eos> So now you're blackmailing me?<eos> You forced my hand, now I'm forcing yours.<eos> You don't want to be doing this, Bauer.<eos> No, I don't.
Right, very funny.<eos> It's not the right key.<eos> Now what the fuck will I do?<eos> I can't call my boss.<eos> I already got in trouble once.<eos> I think you'll have to stay at my place.<eos> Do you have a guest room?<eos> We can work that out.<eos> Did you like it?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I met her by chance in the park.<eos> She did not take much space the size of a pigeon with its feathers.<eos> Wrapped in words in names, like mine.<eos> He gave me a book, and another pages that exploded in front of my eyes.<eos> Do not go right now, it's not the time, wait.<eos> It is not the time, little flower. Give me some more of yourself. Give me some more of your life.<eos> Wait.<eos> In love stories, there isn't just love.<eos> Sometimes there is not a single "I love you"<eos> Yet, we do love.each other.
Listen, Beth.<eos> Of the children found the camera, and are the same who left the footprints.<eos> We are doing a really bad joke, right?<eos> I do not like my resume while I sleep.<eos> - I do not even like me. - Well, so what do we do?<eos> We will make sure that does not happen again '. But we...<eos> - No, I want to leave.<eos> - Come on, Beth, do not overdo.<eos> What's up '?<eos> What do we do?
Well, this guy can drive.<eos> He drove with erik lee up in north carolina.<eos> I checked him out, and he's the real deal.<eos> so you're the big, bad boss.<eos> Boss?<eos> Just a businessman.<eos> Sounds good. 'cause I'm looking to do some business.<eos> I'm looking for a crew.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> I did some driving up north -- amateurs.
- I don't know.<eos> What do you know?<eos> That your ransom video already has 47,000 hits on YouTube.<eos> And all the major networks are playing it, including Al Jazeera.<eos> So now your captors have no choice but to follow through.<eos> I found out the number to this phone.<eos> - How?<eos> - Who cares?<eos> I figured it out and you didn't.<eos> Because I didn't.
Holy shit. We have got to hide all of the sharp objects!<eos> You know what else?<eos> I think they're trying to kill her, too. Yeah. Think about it.<eos> That's why they acted so funny after we saved her, because they want her dead.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's good that you and I don't know - if we knew they'd want to kill us, too.<eos> Yeah, that's a good point.<eos> OK, so what... what do we...
Our first single.<eos> The beginning of everything great.<eos> You like it?<eos> Sure.<eos> For what it is.<eos> I feel sorry for you, mate.<eos> You think you're happy.<eos> You think you got it all.<eos> This... your life.<eos> But you don't.
You'll accept the responsibility That you will protect this place for as long as you can.<eos> And then you'll have to find your replacement.<eos> I don't want to protect this place.<eos> Someone has to.<eos> I don't care.<eos> My time is over.<eos> Why?<eos> Why is your time over?<eos> It has to be you, Jacob.<eos> No, it doesn't.
They're all... they're all dead?<eos> Everyone dies sometime, kiddo.<eos> Some of them before you, some... long after you.<eos> But why are they all here now?<eos> Well, there is no, "now"... here.<eos> Where are we, dad?<eos> that you all made together so that you could find one another.<eos> The most important part of your life was the time that you spent with these people.<eos> That's why all of you are here.<eos> Nobody does it alone, Jack.
They're the remaining candidates.<eos> Candidates?<eos> Candidates for what?<eos> To replace Jacob.<eos> She said I was one of them.<eos> And so are you, and so is Hurley.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who d hen who does?
Guys... J--<eos> Just--just be better.<eos> - Oh, frak me!<eos> I can't believe I had him.<eos> I don't even remember anything about him.<eos> - Time to be better.<eos> - Starting with?<eos> How do you think people would react If they knew that terror mom's house hadn't been searched Because of bureaucratic red tape?<eos> - I don't think they'd be very happy.<eos> - I don't either.
Eric, this is just stupid.<eos> Go away.<eos> Eric. Forgive him.<eos> In the brief time you have left.<eos> No forgiveness.<eos> I won't let you do this.<eos> Sweetie, please.<eos> Use your gift.<eos> -l don't know how.<eos> -Yes, you do.
-You can and you will if I gotta drag your narrow ass through this world kicking and screaming.<eos> Look, the Buddhists weren't lying when they said life is suffering.<eos> It don't mean you get to check out early and leave me here.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> First I'm gonna get some food in you.<eos> Second there's something you need to see.<eos> You want me to stay here?<eos> I feel weird leaving you all alone.<eos> I'm a vampire, Sookie. I don't need- l don't need a babysitter.<eos> -Of course you don't.
- Really? I think you might have a little too much faith in the bond you share with a mass murderer.<eos> I got a call, Carlos.<eos> Your boy Justino was spotted at the Iguana Bar down in South Beach five hours ago.<eos> Since then, nothing.<eos> He's probably gonna blow town.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> - If this don't check out...<eos> - What are you gonna do? You gonna kill me?<eos> Find him, Carlos.<eos> Do it fast. Do it alone.
No, Lynette. We owe you everything.<eos> So, what do we do now?<eos> I guess we just wait and pray.<eos> I think that's a really good idea.<eos> Lynette, are you okay?<eos> I don't know, I just...<eos> I have this terrible pain.<eos> The truth is, no one knows who survived that tragic plane crash...<eos> Tom, I think there's something wrong with the babies.<eos> ...or more importantly, who didn't.
So, here I am.<eos> Tom Scavo's bitch of a wife, in the flesh.<eos> Why do you put it like that?<eos> I don't know specifically what word he uses.<eos> I'm just picking the one that seems the most likely.<eos> So you think your husband describes you as a bitch?<eos> Doesn't he?<eos> What Tom says in this room is private.<eos> Which means "yes."<eos> Well, obviously it does to you.
I mean, claude can go invisible anytime he wants.<eos> It gives him a distinct advantage.<eos> Advantage?<eos> You're supposed to be partners.<eos> What is it, trust issues?<eos> I mean, how could it not be?<eos> He's abnormal.<eos> I mean, sometimes when I'm alone, I get this feeling in my gut that he's watching me.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Just the terminal phase of bullshit!<eos> What was I saying?<eos> I don't know. Pay attention, don't nod off!<eos> But I'm bored of your talking!<eos> I'm not your mate!<eos> Carole has just left!<eos> What do I do? Christ, I don't know!<eos> I rush into the kitchen.<eos> I go to the fridge.<eos> And what do I do?
I mean. here's Rachel, this girl from the trailer park convincing all these rich kids that she was one of them.<eos> I was proud of her until I realized her plan to kill Ted Wheetly and take his money.<eos> She convinced Carson to kill his father.<eos> But it was easy because Carson hated his dad.<eos> Carson and Rachel came to me first.<eos> He blamed his dad for king his mom.<eos> - And Carson wanted him dead.<eos> - Not at first.<eos> But Rachel worked on him.<eos> And in the end he did.
Junior!<eos> What kind of behavior is this?<eos> Get up right now.<eos> Grandma?<eos> This is my friend, Rupert.<eos> How long have you known each other?<eos> Quite a while.<eos> -I see.<eos> And how did you two become acquainted?<eos> Just like any two people do.
Yes.<eos> - No.<eos> Yes, she did.<eos> - No, not mom.<eos> Gertrude spoke German.<eos> There wasn't any mom.<eos> I remember.<eos> Mom spoke German.<eos> - I remember, too.<eos> No, Mom didn't.
The one with the glass eye?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's too far away<eos> And, you know, dead.<eos> Maybe I could-- You know what?<eos> You be at that airstrip in four hours. I'll figure something out.<eos> Okay. Check the desk.<eos> Look for work schedules call logs, anything that might have Hank's name on it.<eos> How do we know they haven't destroyed everything that has his name on it?<eos> We don't.
A drill instructor for specialized forces.<eos> Received a gold star and a military merit order.<eos> Say hello to your guarantor, gentlemen.<eos> He's got bad credit...<eos> Mainly enemy raids, munitions, assassination and kidnap.<eos> Specializes in secret foreign operations.<eos> How much do you need?<eos> You sold this here?<eos> There's been some kind of mix-up.<eos> We do loans, not telephones.
And in so doing, he made a Belgian woman unhappy.<eos> The one he didn't marry.<eos> Left her at the mercy of any passing frog!<eos> That's why he's unhappy.<eos> A Frenchman asks a Belgian customs agent,<eos> "Could you check "if my turning lights work?"<eos> "I'd be happy to, waffle waffle."<eos> So the Frenchman turns his blinkers on. The Belgian goes around, leans over and concentrates, then he says,<eos> "Yes, they work.<eos> No, they don't!

You call me if you need anything. I 'Il drop you a line tomorrow when I get back from the motel.<eos> (Lynn) You want me to sleep with you tonight?<eos> [sobbing]<eos> [Annie, sobbing] No, please, stop.<eos> (Annie) Stop, please!<eos> Dad, please help me to stop him.<eos> Please, Dad, help!<eos> [screaming] Help me!<eos> No, get off!<eos> [sobbing] Don't.
- That says "exit".<eos> - I know. We are completely making fools of ourselves inside there.<eos> We need to cut our losses and go home.<eos> This slump of yours is out of control.<eos> I admit we're having some early trouble, but that room is like kryptonite to my skills.<eos> It's, like, neutralizing my weapons.<eos> I need to see thingsand touch stuff.<eos> Has it ever occurred to you that these are the kind of people that could figure out you're not who you say you are?<eos> - Come on, son.<eos> - Do not do Ed Lover on me.
That is damage control. Why?<eos> What did I do?<eos> Well,let's see.<eos> You dated your cohost.<eos> Uh,three days ago,you practically proposed to him on air.<eos> So,today,when you're tempted to blurt out how you're a mom now,you can read that instead.<eos> What,uh,wh-what is it?<eos> She wants me to lie and say that I was never pregnant in high school.<eos> People want the truth.<eos> No,no,they don't.
You have Lux drive up.It's like you're actually trying to screw this up.<eos> What?<eos> Oh,my God,you are actually trying to screw this up.<eos> Deep down,you don't really want this,do you?<eos> That's why you forgot the home smoke alarm,right?<eos> Oh,an-and the bong and the sheep,the cab,the driving.<eos> You're actually trying not to get approved.<eos> Admit it,you're in over your head.<eos> You don't want to be a parent.You don't want a kid,admit it.<eos> Like you do?
Kill the deal, or I turn myself in to the U.S. Attorney and tell him my statement was a pack of lies you fed me.<eos> I'm sure that agent you're hanging all the blame on will have no problem backing me up on that.<eos> You have no idea what you're stepping on here, Gemma. End the deal...<eos> or I end your career.<eos> Now, get out.<eos> - What the hell was that?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Gemma's a fugitive.<eos> We got to call it in.<eos> No, we don't.
- Hmm... - Wayne, hey, uh, got a second?<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> I think I came on a little too strong the other day.<eos> It's an emotional time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You had something to say and you said it.<eos> Right.<eos> I...<eos> This town needs Charming PD.<eos> Yes, it does.
How about you, brother?<eos> I may have to hit up Grandma's stash myself.<eos> I got some of that for you.<eos> Did you just get here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is Nate taking all this stuff?<eos> No.<eos> Gemma wanted to pack up all the sentimental objects and valuables, put them in storage.<eos> The rest goes to the church.<eos> You doing okay?
They're coming with me.<eos> I can keep them safe in the rectory.<eos> Jimmy will come looking for them. I know.<eos> You don't have to leave yet.<eos> We're heading out tonight.<eos> I just came by to pack a bag.<eos> I'm sorry about this morning.<eos> It's what you wanted.<eos> I didn't want for you to get hurt.<eos> Yes, you did.
What?<eos> I told Damon that I'd help him get into that tomb, get Katherine back.<eos> But it was a lie.<eos> I let him believe that he could trust me.<eos> Then why would you be worried about telling me?<eos> Because he can be very persuasive and you two have bonded lately.<eos> That doesn't mean I trust him.<eos> It's gonna take a lot more than just a road trip and a rescue for me to forget who Damon is and everything he's done.<eos> I don't wanna be his enemy, Elena, but I can't let him do it.<eos> Then don't.
Hold up!<eos> Hold up!<eos> Hold up!<eos> Jamie, wait!<eos> It's us!<eos> Oh.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Are you gonna tell my parents?<eos> What, that we were stupid enough to fall for your little prank?<eos> Not if you don't.
Switch.<eos> Come on, Cal.<eos> Let's go. Let's go. Beat him.<eos> This is kind of like that Extreme Makeover show.<eos> Minus the boob job.<eos> No one's ever done anything like this for me before.<eos> You're gonna be the belle of the ball, Miss Luli.<eos> - What are you wearing?<eos> - Something I made myself.<eos> - You do that?
You bring it on yourself.<eos> - I hate myself.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Just stop trying so hard.<eos> You're like a butterfly in a wind storm.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Meaning...<eos> I don't know what it means.<eos> It means you're just special, I guess.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Novotny threw you overboard.<eos> What do you know about it?<eos> I'm talking now.<eos> What is it?<eos> I dunno.<eos> Everybody says it was the two of us shooting at Bory.<eos> What if I confirm it.<eos> You ain't gonna survive the can, man.<eos> -So start talking.<eos> -I didn't do anyone.
And so I got her into treatment and found her a welding job, you know, got her back on her feet. And somewhere during all of that, I fell deeply in love with her.<eos> But it was, it was against everything that I believed in.<eos> So I prayed and went into seclusion, but nothing, nothing that I did could, um, keep her from my mind.<eos> And, um, then one morning, I woke up in the hospital.<eos> God, I was scared.<eos> You were pale.<eos> Apparently, I had passed out from dehydration, and when I came to, there was Jackie...<eos> sitting there like an angel.<eos> I thought I'd never see her again.<eos> When I did...
And we got stuck at the 'friends' table.<eos> You know, the table where nobody knows who the hell you are.<eos> You're just kind of like sitting there?<eos> And I, uh, I spilled champagne all over her dress.<eos> - Oh, all over my dress.<eos> - Yup. And then I freak, 'cause I, I realize how beautiful she is.<eos> - It still gives me goosebumps. - Yeah.<eos> We were born in the same town, Silverton, Oregon - less than 10,000 people - within a week of each other.<eos> We travelled nearly a million miles to find one another.<eos> And we did.
Max Matheson, is this what I think it is?<eos> - Well, what do you think it is?<eos> - l don't know.<eos> A drunk driver.<eos> He hit you?<eos> I swerved to avoid him.<eos> I wrapped my car around a telephone pole.<eos> Technically, it was my fault.<eos> And your fiancée, she- she died in the accident?<eos> We both did.
That's more than anyone else has been willing to do around here.<eos> Eleanor.<eos> I'm tying my best.<eos> I'm tying my best.<eos> Really.<eos> Please.<eos> Stop doing this.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Please, don't- don't do this.
- It sure is.<eos> If you have to shoot somebody Mr Young, you shoot me.<eos> He's one of the Governor's!<eos> I had just lost him there for a second!<eos> Now hold on there boys!<eos> How come you didn't tell me 'bout this gun?<eos> Like I told ya...<eos> Like I told ya...<eos> I'd have to kill any man who took my guns from me!<eos> So he did.
I just felt empty.<eos> I couldn't think.<eos> I couldn't breathe.<eos> And I just wanted it to be over and done so I wouldn't feel that anymore... and I wouldn't be alone.<eos> Well, you're... you're not alone anymore.<eos> You have a baby upstairs.<eos> And I almost killed her.<eos> You can't force me to have this surgery, can you?<eos> I think we'd all like you to want it.<eos> Well, I don't.
You are leaving with me if I have to arrest you and put you in handcuffs.<eos> I need her to stay at your place tonight.<eos> What's going on?<eos> There have been threats.<eos> Did you screw things up with her?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, I say if you're gonna be a bear, be a grizzly.<eos> But this, my friends, is a Kodiak.<eos> Bo thinks I ripped him off.<eos> Didn't you?
They picked out kids like we were puppies... or cars.<eos> No one ever chose me.<eos> Including you.<eos> So, don't tell me that this isn't a big deal or that you understand how I feel because you don't.<eos> Okay, Lux...<eos> Okay, everyone, time to pull two lucky names... Wait, Lux, please, Lux, wait.<eos> I do. I understand.<eos> No, no!<eos> I do understand.<eos> No, you don't.
You said that I could come to you for whatever I needed. That you'd be there.<eos> You weren't.<eos> Baze... he was.<eos> So, uh, you met with Fern to get custody?<eos> Is this your way of getting back at me for lying about you to Ryan?<eos> It was for Tasha.<eos> No, this is for you.<eos> Don't act like this isn't what you wanted this whole time.<eos> To be with my kid?<eos> Yeah, Cate, yeah, I did.
Look, I... he hurt you.<eos> I mean, he rejected you at a time in your life when you were most vulnerable.<eos> And then he goes and he starts dating your sister.<eos> So it's like he's doing it all over again.<eos> You don't need his approval.<eos> You don't need anybody's approval.<eos> But for what it's worth, you got mine.<eos> Look, I don't care what bridges are still closed. We can book it to the coast and get married.<eos> I want that.<eos> I do.
I don't know who you saw, sweetie, But I got to side with ariel on this one.<eos> This is one of the oldest tricks in the book.<eos> I've gotten 100 e-mails like this.<eos> People who send them aren't connected To african royalty In any way, shape, or form;<eos> they're just criminals.<eos> Okay, but I think you're wrong.<eos> Okay.<eos> They were on a shelf in the bedroom; hidden in plain sight.<eos> Obviously, the cops never bothered to actually look At the tapes when they searched his place.<eos> My people didn't, either, the first time through.
Take a breath.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> I'm good.<eos> I believe you.<eos> When did you last have a decent night's sleep, Jeff, eh?<eos> One or two months ago.<eos> Army gives me pills, but they don't do squat.<eos> What, the little white one?<eos> Listen, I know- - I know what you're thinking.<eos> No, you don't.
So then how does he get hit in the head?<eos> He doesn't get hit in the head.<eos> He - He makes observations.<eos> He tells the truth in a funny way.<eos> Come on. He's been on Johnny Carson a hundred times.<eos> Who the hell is Johnny Carson?<eos> Oh, for God's sake.<eos> Gloria and I are from different generations. And I won't lie- It isn't always easy.<eos> I mean, last week she thought Simon and Garfunkel were my lawyers.<eos> No I didn't.
'cause I do not want him to get cocky.<eos> Ah, he'll be fine.<eos> Do you know how old that makes us?<eos> you know what else is funny? What?<eos> That, uh, my biggest regret is that I messed up with you.<eos> Jules, I would kill to have all this back.<eos> How is that funny?<eos> Well, it's not funny "ha ha." you know, it's more whimsical.<eos> Uh, bobby- you just said that all a woman wants to hear Is how a man really feels. Well...<eos> I did, didn't I?
Last night, Baze helped me with my homework.<eos> Who knew he was so adept at fractions?<eos> Last night, I took Lux to see a stage play.<eos> Of Billy Elliott.<eos> I thought it had an uplifting theme.<eos> Lots of dancing.<eos> Last night, we partied on Rock Band for hours.<eos> I mean, up until her bed time which is a strictly-enforced hard 10:00.<eos> No snacking after 9:00.<eos> Do you... do you Rock Band?
Come on, it's not that bad.<eos> If she was a filly, they'd shoot her.<eos> I know you took a shine to her, but she gotta go.<eos> She hasn't even had her stitches out.<eos> This is a cathouse, not the Hotel Sherman.<eos> She don't earn, I don't earn.<eos> What if I cover it?<eos> $100 a day?<eos> - She makes that much?<eos> - She did.
Irish?<eos> Belfast.<eos> You ok, foster?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> All right, the man that was killed by that bomb Was not a foss fuel entrepreneur.<eos> He was british liaison for counterterrorism At the Pentagon. And 7 years ago he was my boss.<eos> Ok, who is he to you, Frost?<eos> Did you work at the Pentagon, too, or...<eos> Oh, my God,<eos> Dad? You did.
I can't risk that.<eos> I won't.<eos> You're right.<eos> I can't go back to how it was before.<eos> Before this, before you.<eos> We should do what I should have done in Prague.<eos> We should run. But, Chuck, is that what you really want?<eos> I want you.<eos> Sarah Walker, do you agree to quit the spy life with me?<eos> I do.
You're right.<eos> I can't go back to how it was before.<eos> Before this, before you.<eos> We should do what I should have done in Prague.<eos> We should run. But, Chuck, is that what you really want?<eos> I want you.<eos> Sarah Walker, do you agree to quit the spy life with me?<eos> I do.<eos> Chuck Bartowski, do you agree to quit the spy life with me?<eos> I do.
May I just say I've been on the run for two years, and no matter how far you run, you can never run from yourself.<eos> And from what I've heard from both of you, it's not what either of you really wants.<eos> You don't want to quit?<eos> I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> I don't want you to choose me over sometng that you want for yourself.<eos> I want you.<eos> I want us.<eos> Do you think if we went back, and we told Beckman the honest-to-god absolute truth, do you think we'd really have a shot at having it all?<eos> Chuck Bartowski, do you agree to not quit the spy life and be with me?<eos> I do.
You don't want to quit?<eos> I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> I don't want you to choose me over sometng that you want for yourself.<eos> I want you.<eos> I want us.<eos> Do you think if we went back, and we told Beckman the honest-to-god absolute truth, do you think we'd really have a shot at having it all?<eos> Chuck Bartowski, do you agree to not quit the spy life and be with me?<eos> I do.<eos> Sarah Walker, do you agree to not quit the spy life and be with me?<eos> I do.
He offered to support her financially, but my mom, who was very proud, turned him down.<eos> - But he did visit you.<eos> - A few times.<eos> But my mom asked him to stop because it was too hard on me.<eos> - And did you ever see him again? - Yes.<eos> From right here.<eos> I used to ride my bike over.<eos> I'd watch you and Andrew and Danielle.<eos> I wanted to understand why my father would choose all of you over me.<eos> And I did.
Renai?<eos> Renai!<eos> - What, what, what?<eos> What is it?<eos> - There's someone here. There's someone in the room!<eos> He was right there, I swear!<eos> Don't you dare not believe me.<eos> Please. Please, believe me.<eos> I swear he was right there.<eos> I do, I do.
That whole action stuff is difficult enough for you.<eos> On the whole, I sympathize with you.<eos> But the people here think very differently on that.<eos> An animal activist... and a butchered butcher. You can't miss that.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> The victim?<eos> May I see it again?<eos> Great picture.<eos> You know him?<eos> - No, I don't.
- She doesn't wanna know you.<eos> She doesn't wanna talk to you.<eos> - Isobel?<eos> - You need to stop looking.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - She's alive?<eos> Does that mean she's a...?<eos> - He's under compulsion.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Café Brasil?<eos> - Hopefully that ain't gonna happen here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> What?<eos> It's a chicken... a chicken.<eos> It's a live chicken.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, a live chicken in the studio.<eos> The loa needs proof of our devotion.<eos> Yeah, what woman doesn't?
I decided what you need is practice.<eos> Now, you say the problem is his cute, sad eyes?<eos> All right, shut it, woman.<eos> Now, I want you to look at this teacup pig, and tell him that there's no way that you could ever be with him.<eos> Teacup pig, there is no way I can ever be with you.<eos> - Right now.<eos> - Oh, come on, grow a pair!<eos> I'm sorry. But he's just so freaking cute.<eos> I just want to cuddle him all day long.<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh, well, it's okay. I'll find my own ride home.<eos> Ava... You are beautiful and drunk.<eos> But on account of that target Bo's got on your back, none of these boys are gonna get within 20 feet of you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Um, Hestler over there - he'll take good care of me.<eos> Won't you, Hestler.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Oh, you don't remember Hestler Jones?<eos> He was the creepy kid who used to, you know, sit in the bleachers and smile his creepy little smile?<eos> He just did eight years in the state pen for statutory rape.
I feel like I'm talking to a wall right now.<eos> So this isn't steroids?<eos> This is rabies?<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Larry, I'm about to flip out on this guy.<eos> - Me too!<eos> - Dude, what are you doing keeping rabies in your drawer?<eos> Before big games I shoot rabies.<eos> It gives me the edge I need and it's undetectable.<eos> Only idiot losers do steroids anymore.
See, that kind of talk...<eos> That does get you killed.<eos> He is selling Cylons for profit to the STO, and he knows the difference one unit would make for the resistance on Tauron.<eos> Just one for his people.<eos> For his soil.<eos> You know what they're capable of.<eos> Imagine a single soldier robot fighting for your cause.<eos> The cause that your parents...<eos> Hey, hey! You know frak about my parents!<eos> No, I don't.
Yes, we asian women are all about the hoops.<eos> So if you've got any homework, do it.<eos> And beyond that just, you know, Be good and don't-<eos> - Torch the place?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It was one little single-alarm fire At his old house the week his father ran off. He was angry.<eos> He just- Stacked 20 of his dad's suits on the driveway, Added some top-shelf cognac and lit 'em up?<eos> In a way, but we all need<eos> - To let things out every now and then.<eos> - No, we don't.
Last few days have been insane.<eos> Morgan, all I've been trying to do is get a second of your time to give you this.<eos> Some stuff you left behind in Hawaii. Thought you may want it back.<eos> Huh.<eos> I think I'm okay without it.<eos> Well... here's something else you may have forgotten.<eos> I got to hand it to you, Morgan. You really know how to play a girl.<eos> Well, you know, some men have it and-<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't...
Now you should understand.<eos> I told Preston I want to move up wedding to next week, - and he said yes.<eos> - Next week?<eos> The wedding is not for another six months.<eos> We cannot wait that long.<eos> It is too hard for Preston to choose between a mother and a girlfriend.<eos> So, once I am his wife, choice will be much easier.<eos> No. No, you can't do this.<eos> You met each other six weeks ago. Preston barely knows you.<eos> But you do, yes?
Addresses, relatives, whatever.<eos> If we don't find anything, it keeps us busy.<eos> But I think we should try. Okay.<eos> Arvidsson, check out Disa Månson's family relationships.<eos> Ek will contact the Stockholm Police regarding the dental records.<eos> - The two of us need to talk together?<eos> Didn't you get an order yesterday, I was to go to Vidar's with you?<eos> - And if I got it? - So we two aren't okay.<eos> - I know you after all.<eos> - No, you don't.
Come on!<eos> How come it's not new?<eos> Because it's already old.<eos> Been here thousands of years.<eos> No-one knows exactly how long.<eos> OK, this Pandorica thing.<eos> Last time we saw you, you warned us about it, after we climbed out of Byzantium.<eos> Spoilers!<eos> No, but you told the Doctor you'd see him again when the Pandorica opens.<eos> Maybe I did.
Well, I'm glad to be of service.<eos> Oh, just one more thing before you go.<eos> What's that, my dear?<eos> See you at work on Monday, Griffin. Huh?<eos> Oh, I'm gonna have to have a word with Rite-Aid about this fake moustache.<eos> Well, I got my job back, Angela's happy again, and she's not gonna harass me anymore.<eos> Everything worked out perfect.<eos> Not really, Peter.<eos> Yeah, you cheated on your wife.<eos> No, I didn't.
Look, relax, will ya?<eos> Here, I got these off a Web site that tells you good things to say when hot women walk by.<eos> Ooh, here comes a hot one.<eos> Say the first thing on the list.<eos> Um, I-I love getting trendy cupcakes in the middle of the day for no reason.<eos> No way.<eos> So do I. Hi.<eos> I'm Paula.<eos> Carter.<eos> How do you do.
Everything that could fucking go wrong Went wrong for this guy.<eos> I could really use a joint motion here.<eos> No joint motions on emergency hearings for the time being.<eos> - Eddie's policy.<eos> - Eddie's policy?<eos> An innocent man lost in the system For nearly six months.<eos> - Albert:<eos> Who that? - Chie<eos> Mr. Newsome.<eos> How you doing today, sir?
Give me your mobile.<eos> Where's my mobile?<eos> Shit!<eos> I can't hear a thing.<eos> What?<eos> Our truck's been captured.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> I'll find out soon, and solve the problem.<eos> We know who did it.<eos> - Yes, we do.
We're going to change it.<eos> You still thinking about that girl?<eos> Give her something sparkly. Talk pretty to her.<eos> It's a piece of cake.<eos> There are sights to see at night.<eos> Ladies, this is Kolja, your new boss.<eos> Take care, girls.<eos> Come, this way.<eos> We know who did it.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Gomey, go beat your piñata.<eos> Rest of you jokers, too damn quiet in here.<eos> Catch some bad guys.<eos> Hey, what's up, Walt?<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> - Fixing up the house, huh?<eos> - Doing a little work, yeah.<eos> Well, I'll bounce.<eos> It's cool.<eos> You doing okay?
A wizard alien would be able to cast a spell on our species.<eos> Causing all the men to become sex addicts.<eos> Enough!<eos> We have to find the wizard alien and break his spell!<eos> Okay, okay. Alright, hang on guys.<eos> I mean come on, this is getting a little riculous.<eos> Wizard alien?<eos> We all know what's going on here, don't we?<eos> Whenever a story breaks about some rich famous guy Going around and having sex with tons of girls, We all want to act like we don't understand it.<eos> But we do.
I was saying you're gonna do great.<eos> Morning.<eos> I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news.<eos> They canceled the meeting.<eos> -Are you kidding me?<eos> -What?<eos> They decided to give it to Leo Burnett.<eos> Burnett has Marlboro already.<eos> I thought they wanted a fresh start with this.<eos> So did I.
I'm sorry I didn't call.<eos> I was...<eos> Did she want to talk to me?<eos> You know, she wasn't really there.<eos> I'm coming out.<eos> I'll make the arrangements.<eos> No need.<eos> She left her body to science.<eos> She said she wanted to go to UCLA Medical School tuition-free.<eos> Of course she did.
Gwen's in there with Mr Bromidge.<eos> She's being interviewed.<eos> I cannot use my library because one of the housemaids is in there applying for anotherjob?<eos> That's about the size of it.<eos> So, what is it you want to know?<eos> I want to know the truth about the case against him.<eos> I want to know why the sergeant thought it was odd.<eos> I want to know what Mr Bates isn't saying.<eos> Because you don't believe him to be guilty?<eos> No, I don't.
You better watch your back down there.<eos> Oh, watching my back is your job.<eos> - I don't know. Am I in your will?<eos> - You get my dog.<eos> You don't have a dog.<eos> Hey. Remember, my dad doesn't want S-11 harmed, all right?<eos> And we always do what Daddy says, don't we?<eos> Relax, I've got 300,000 reasons to bring that thing back in one piece.<eos> We stick to the plan, tranq it, force it to the surface, then Santos shoots it with your remote control gizmo, and you guys jockey it back to your yacht, if your gear really works.<eos> Yeah, it does work.
The terrorist wanted to attack those he felt were hurting the planet.<eos> So he got the woman to help him build a bomb.<eos> But something went wrong, and someone was killed.<eos> The terrorist didn't care.<eos> He said it was unavoidable.<eos> The woman wanted to turn herself in, but she was pregnant.<eos> So the agent convinced her to run away with him.<eos> And he'd raise the child as his own.<eos> So they escaped from the terrorist, hoping and praying he would never find them.<eos> Unfortunately, he did.
I have done a few sketches.<eos> Which we have archived so we can use the kit.<eos> Mm, yeah.<eos> The kit.<eos> Uh, the kit.<eos> Which, uh, we're gonna do together.<eos> I am petrified to do this with Mitchell.<eos> He built a couple of theater sets in college or something,<eos> And now he thinks he knows everything about building.<eos> Well, he doesn't.
You finally had what you wanted.<eos> -I wanted my brother alive.<eos> SAM:<eos> You wanted a family.<eos> You only gave it up because of the way we lived.<eos> But you had something, were building something.<eos> I need you to go. You're a hunter.<eos> You know your brother's there. Things are different.<eos> -You don't wanna be here.<eos> -Yes, I do.
Just do me a favor. Plug everything in before you go.<eos> Stop it, Frankie.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look at... look at my feet!<eos> I have the feet of a 90-year-old woman!<eos> You're just pruny from the water.<eos> You're not falling apart.<eos> Oh, yeah, says the man in perfect health Who's carrying me like a fireman in his prime!<eos> I don't have perfect health.<eos> Yes, you do.
Noise.<eos> Those roll-up doors at the front of the store facing the street...<eos> Meet us there and be ready.<eos> - Come on!<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> - Hey, you can't leave me here!<eos> I'm not fooling, man!<eos> Morales!<eos> - Hey, man!<eos> Don't do this!
- His brother.<eos> At least somebody's having a good day.<eos> - Give it back.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - No!<eos> - I found it. - No!<eos> - Give it.<eos> M'hijo, leave your sister alone. - Why? - Come on.<eos> Baby, the more you fidget, the longer it takes.<eos> - So don't, okay?
Don't you make me a liar.<eos> Nah, I'm not going back.<eos> Something happened to me back there that made me realize I have to be here for my son.<eos> You almost die or something?<eos> I should know better than to ask.<eos> Anything else happen to you over there that you'd maybe like to talk about?<eos> A little something something?<eos> I like the set of her chin. Right?<eos> Does Dr. Brennan know?<eos> Of course she does.
- It's closer.<eos> - Closer.<eos> Now, I know I promised that the decision was yours and yours alone, but I did send away for a few catalogs just to give you a sense of your options.<eos> A few?<eos> Now, with your grades and sat scores, plus extracurriculars, I truly think you have a shot at getting into any one of these schools.<eos> The trick is gonna be the essay questions, and talk about personal interviews later...<eos> I think I've already decided where I want to go.<eos> Your top choice?<eos> That's great.<eos> Why don't we do this in tiers?
Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, my god, this is Harriet Soloway.<eos> - Does she work here?<eos> - Yes, in R D.<eos> What happened?<eos> The dead body is Harriet Soloway!<eos> My god!<eos> I thought she was at the cocoa bean symposium in Baltimore.<eos> So did I.
A baby!<eos> That is so awesome!<eos> A baby!<eos> So good!<eos> Stop.<eos> You knew, didn't you?<eos> We didn't.<eos> No, I was surprised.<eos> They knew.<eos> They didn't...
And he's a very charming young man.<eos> So, anyway, no need to worry, all's well that ends well.<eos> Richard?<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't think there's anything more to say.<eos> - Castle?<eos> - It's clear.<eos> He's gone.<eos> I'm fine. Ryan needs an ambulance.<eos> No, I don't. Hey.
Which gender?<eos> Welcome to your past, beeyotch!<eos> I've never been to a sorority party with a date before.<eos> It's kinda cool how all these girls are suddenly into me.<eos> Just cool for me, huh? Yeah.<eos> Is that laurie?<eos> I overheard kyle-- that douche-y sigma chi Who's always wring the jester hat-- Say that he hooked up with missy here,<eos> Even though he dates a kappa. Missy, did you?<eos> Wow.<eos> She totally did.
I was just talking with doc Frankel.<eos> He went to TMU.<eos> Aw, you should have seen his face when I told him they want you on the team.<eos> Now, dad, I don't want you telling people before they actually...<eos> I know we butted heads about college.<eos> I know, but I'm proud of you.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Put your noose back on.<eos> - Yeah. Mom wants to get some pictures of the pastor and the football star.<eos> Do... do up your top button.
Oh, does your wife know about her?<eos> No?<eos> What about the secret bank accounts?<eos> Everything you love.<eos> Everything you own.<eos> If anything ever happens to Hetty, anything, we will come for you.<eos> I have no reason... to harm her.<eos> The book... does not exist.<eos> That's a good boy.<eos> It never did.
Okay, G, hear me out on this.<eos> What does this guy do with his gloves afterwards?<eos> Well, first thing, you would, uh, burn them, shred them;<eos> it's full of DNA.<eos> What if he's going fast, got careless, left a glove behind, like a box or in the dirt in the hole.<eos> Case is closed.<eos> I mean, we catch him the second we find that glove.<eos> But there is no glove.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Maybe neither does the killer.
It's a tourist map of Long Beach.<eos> I doubt they were buying souvenirs to bring back to Somalia.<eos> Routes all along the waterfront are highlighted.<eos> So, we got a dead Al Qaeda member, a dead former intelligence agent, a dead plastic surgeon...<eos> And three terrorists with new faces on the loose.<eos> The one person who can ID them is doing her best to disappear.<eos> Okay, so let's assume their target is in Long Beach.<eos> We don't know where.<eos> We don't know when.<eos> Yes, we do.
You want to go?<eos> What?<eos> You want to go?<eos> ! No. I just want to make sure you feel anonymous enough.<eos> You broke my heart.<eos> Not intentionally.<eos> Well, that's a relief.<eos> Donna, I'm not...<eos> I'm not domestic. You think that's what I wanted?<eos> Yeah, I do.
They smell blood in the water, and they want to tear you to pieces.<eos> Stay out.<eos> Is that French toast?<eos> Leave it.<eos> Where's my position on capital punishment?<eos> You're not changing your position on capital punishment.<eos> You know that Alicia's working on the Carter Wright appeal, don't you?<eos> You know, some industrious reporter is going to point out the contradiction.<eos> They're going after family, because they see you lose your cool when they come after family.<eos> So don't.
Say that again!<eos> I'm Nobuyuki Shamoto.<eos> Shut up, idiot! I'm asking you where he's gone!<eos> Early last Thursday evening, I took 4.5 million out of the safe for him...<eos> You've already told me that!<eos> You keep repeating it!<eos> I think you're lying!<eos> Don't bully him, please.<eos> Listen, Mr. Amazon. Do you know that my brother didn't really trust you?<eos> He didn't?
Peter.<eos> Ownership has its privileges.<eos> You didn't shift.<eos> I didn't have to.<eos> I got it.<eos> Don't worry about them.<eos> I took care of it.<eos> We're clean.<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> I didn't.
Really?<eos> You should go for it, yeah.<eos> My friend saw him around here this morning.<eos> He has an intimate relationship with alcohol, so I figured I'd check all the bars first.<eos> He doesn't drink here, but he looks very much like my new waiter.<eos> Is he American, from New York?<eos> All I know is he came to Paris from, uh, Prague with my niece.<eos> Well, if he's who I think he is, he could be in a lot of trouble.<eos> I-I need to talk to him.<eos> He doesn't do much talking, especially about himself.
It keeps the memory of my real mother perfectly intact.<eos> Good-Bye, elena.<eos> As long as you have a salvatore on each arm, You're doomed.<eos> Katherine was smart.<eos> She got out.<eos> But we all know that you're not katherine.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey, it's anna.<eos> Jeremy, we have to talk about this.<eos> No, we really don't.
He hates all vampires.<eos> He's just doing what he thinks is right.<eos> Are you defending him?<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> It's just...<eos> I do understand where he's coming from.<eos> He's convinced all the tomb vampires want revenge on this town and he's just... He's trying to protect it.<eos> They do want revenge.<eos> Or at least they did.
Don't flirt with me, Katherine. I'm not Damon.<eos> I haven't spent 145 years obsessed with you.<eos> Yeah, based on your choice of women, I'd say otherwise.<eos> Though it does bother me that you've fallen in love with someone else.<eos> Oh, I was never in love with you, Katherine.<eos> You compelled me.<eos> So none of my feelings were real.<eos> Believe what you want, Stefan.<eos> But I know the truth.<eos> And deep down, so do you. STEFAN:
- Yeah, well, neither did I.<eos> - Why did you have to get involved?<eos> - Because I didn't want you to get hurt.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> You can't feel that way about me.<eos> Don't.<eos> What?<eos> Don't act like this is one-sided. Like... Like I'm some kid that has a crush on his sister's friend.<eos> You could have died today.<eos> And you almost did.
Trav, go get it.<eos> Could be a meatball, brother.<eos> God, I hate lying to him.<eos> Hi, kylie.<eos> If trav goes to california we'll break up, But if he stays here, we'll get married And have beautiful babies.<eos> He told me you'd say that. Please.<eos> You kids are gonna make it.<eos> They are so done-zo. You do realize<eos> That it doesn't matter where travis goes to college? I know.<eos> Except it totally does.
And I'm serious.<eos> But here's what's happening, in case any of you have heard.<eos> I'm bringing an NFL team to Los Angeles.<eos> And it won't affect this company, by the way, except we all might have really good football seats.<eos> Mike Ovitz couldn't do it.<eos> I will.<eos> Shh.<eos> The NFL has a prestigious reputation.<eos> What you say and do can affect mine.<eos> Don't.
No, bro, I'm gonna hit the gym early, take out my frustrations on the heavy bag.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Maybe one more dance.<eos> All right, later.<eos> - See you.<eos> - See you.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Pussies.<eos> We don't need them.<eos> No we don't.
Why would I wait for Adam to get here when I'm perfectly capable...<eos> Camille, look, I'm not going to be stopped from fixing a leak in my own house because some...<eos> I hear you and I see you.<eos> And I'm breathing.<eos> You're out of luck.<eos> Yeah? Yeah. Too bad.<eos> Hey!<eos> Did I come from a vagina?<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> Did I?
You're too hard on yourself.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Come on, you're not really quitting.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Yes, I am quitting.<eos> I don't want to make things harder for you.<eos> Listen to me, okay?<eos> Look at me. I want you there.<eos> What?<eos> - I do, I really do.
What?<eos> When?<eos> Just now?<eos> The area just north of Taconic State Parkway.<eos> This possible terrorist attack comes a mere three days after the commencement of the Live-Aboard program.<eos> Stunned and shocked people...<eos> - Lisa could've been on that shuttle.<eos> - I'm sure she's okay.<eos> How do you know, Mom?<eos> I don't. It, uh...
Sister!<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> Tricking people? What? Get back!<eos> Get up<eos> I clearly saw what happened<eos> The bamboo spinner fell on the ground, it didn't hit you at all<eos> How dare you meddle with me!<eos> I'm warning you, if you don't stop right now, I'll alert the police<eos> You need a beating!<eos> No, she doesn't
How can I help?<eos> I need some medicine for a friend<eos> What else would you buy in a drug store, kid<eos> Which is better to treat bruises, powder or ointment?<eos> What? He's injured?<eos> What happened?<eos> A fight?<eos> What else?<eos> Who beat him?<eos> I did
Here, let me feel you for- I'm...<eos> I'm okay.<eos> But there's blood spreading down your thighs.<eos> I'm having a miscarriage.<eos> We need a stapler. We need lidocaine, morine and an irrigation tray. Come on.<eos> Are you gonna help me or not?<eos> Let's go.<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> You want to know something funny?<eos> Do you?
JP Morgan took over first Bear Stearns and then WAMU.<eos> Bank of America took over Countrywide and Merrill Lynch.<eos> Wells Fargo took over Wachovia.<eos> After the crisis, the financial industry... including the Financial Services Roundtable... worked harder than ever to fight reform.<eos> he financial sector employs 3,000 lobbyists... more than five for each member of Congress.<eos> Do you think the financial services industry... has excessive political influence in the United States? No.<eos> I think that every person in, in the wo... in the country is represented here in Washington.<eos> And you think that all segments of American society... have equal and fair access to the system?<eos> Yet, you can walk into any hearing room, uh... that you would like.<eos> Yes, I do.
The financial industry also exerts its influence... in a more subtle way... one that most Americans don't know about.<eos> It has corrupted the study of economics itself.<eos> Deregulation had tremendous financial and intellectual support. Because, uh, uh... people argued it for their own benefit.<eos> Economics profession was the main source of that illusion.<eos> Since the 1980s, academic economists... have been major advocates of deregulation, and played powerful roles in shaping U.S. government policy.<eos> Very few of these economic experts warned about the crisis.<eos> And even after the crisis, many of them opposed reform.<eos> The guys who taught these things tended to get paid a lot of money being consultants.<eos> Business school professors don't live on a faculty salary.<eos> They do very, very well.
It's almost over.<eos> Now you've got your son again.<eos> What happened?<eos> It's your fault for throwing the bottle!<eos> Why'd you throw the bottle?<eos> Excuse me, can I help?<eos> - No, no. Go away.<eos> Come in.<eos> He hasn't taken his pills in two days.<eos> You didn't?
Since when did I become the kid in class That the teacher won't call on?<eos> The evidence in my report Says that you killed Pedro Hernandez.<eos> And you're not even willing to talk to me about it.<eos> I didn't think I needed to.<eos> I owe you everything.<eos> You're Gibbs.<eos> No one needs to know the truth about the Hernandez investigation.<eos> I am willing to do anything for you.<eos> I just need you to tell me what to do.<eos> No, you don't Abbs.
You're Gibbs.<eos> No one needs to know the truth about the Hernandez investigation.<eos> I am willing to do anything for you.<eos> I just need you to tell me what to do.<eos> No, you don't Abbs.<eos> I've only ever needed you to do one thing.<eos> My job.<eos> But it's different this time.<eos> I mean it has to be, right?<eos> No, it doesn't.
It was you, wasn't it?<eos> You're the one Who told the prisoners about the seed ship?<eos> Any major developments aboard Destiny Concern them as well.<eos> They had a right to know.<eos> Oh, dammit, Camile, they're prisoners.<eos> They don't have any rights.<eos> Oh, I can't believe what I'm hearing.<eos> They attacked the ship, they threatened us.<eos> And now we have to live with them.<eos> No, we don't.
Okay.<eos> You listen to me. I can see where you're going.<eos> I know, because I almost went there.<eos> I'm afraid that you won't come back.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's weird.<eos> What?<eos> The computer's using a ton of memory running a program I've never even seen before.<eos> Maybe some kind of auto diagnostic?<eos> I don't...
June doesn't like to upset me.<eos> Fletcher, this reformer running for Mayor, he gave an interview alleging corruption in both the mayor's and the Sheriff's office.<eos> He mentioned me by name?<eos> "Has Mayor Bacharach even questioned<eos> "what Sheriff Eli Thompson was doing at an illegal casino at 3:00 a. M?"<eos> So I was there.<eos> So what?<eos> How's he know I wasn't answering a call?<eos> Because he knows, Eli.<eos> Everybody does.
No, it's about the people around me as they enter the next chapter of their lives. Ahh.<eos> Poker sounds better.<eos> Which people?<eos> Actually, I've spent the last few days filming Mouth.<eos> So you're following up your successful indie with a documentary about Mouth?<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> It's just weird.<eos> I mean, he hasn't even filmed me yet, and I'm your boss.<eos> Which reminds me, who said you could have the night off?<eos> Uh, Lucas did.
Great.<eos> We have a deal.<eos> You drive a hard bargain.<eos> And you have a private jet.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Teach me.<eos> The science, I mean.<eos> Well, you got 8 years, have you?<eos> I want to shadow you. I want to watch what you do.<eos> How you do it.
I got not a single message from you.<eos> I gave birth to a fatherless child.<eos> People called me a whore.<eos> I've stopped waiting.<eos> Please...<eos> Why did you come?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'm not going back to the mountains.<eos> I don't want to go back either.<eos> I don't.
- I haven't the choice.<eos> Your Grace, it's sure the King will die before the Prince reaches his maturity.<eos> So who will then govern the Prince... And the realm?<eos> - Just pinch her, for God's sake.<eos> Just pinch her that's all.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> - We ask you again.<eos> Which of the ladies of Her Majesty's chamber sent you monies or promises of relief?<eos> - We want to know which of the Queen's Ladies share your beliefs.<eos> Or if the Queen herself does.
Wheat.<eos> "Wheat"?<eos> You're an accountant, and you're out of your depth.<eos> A bit full of ourselves, aren't we?<eos> You want to know what I've spent the last two years working on?<eos> Five companies... five... Control all the world's agriculture.<eos> Trillions of dollars.<eos> They do it through wheat.<eos> The world's entire food supply is founded on wheat.<eos> Of course you didn't.
Why?<eos> - I think her music is causing this.<eos> - No, I don't think so.<eos> - No, come on, Nathan. This is not just me being excited over the weirdness.<eos> - I didn't say it was.<eos> I just don't think it's Lilly who's causing this.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Ray sat down next to her at the piano, and he started to play.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Ray did?
I just want you to install a browser.<eos> That's the browser there!<eos> Look at it... that's the browser.<eos> Internet Explorer is a browser!<eos> Behind the picture of the lady.<eos> The lady's not supposed to be there.<eos> She's only there sometimes.<eos> But what about that, the E...<eos> But that's the button for the internet, Roy.<eos> I don't...
Maybe he just needed a place to decompress during the day.<eos> No, he... he slept there, he entertained there, he read novels there.<eos> Graham Greene... for God's sake.<eos> I thought he hated Graham Greene.<eos> How could Tom, my Tom, be so cruel?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I still don't believe you.<eos> Believe me.<eos> I don't.<eos> I really don't.
1.3...<eos> I am rated a 1.3 out of 10.<eos> One kid wrote, "I hate Mr. hunt with a passion that burns like 1,000 suns."<eos> That's teaching.<eos> Some kids... they're gonna hate earth science no matter what you do.<eos> You know?<eos> But... you can't quit the team.<eos> We need you.<eos> The kids need you.<eos> No, they don't.
Yes.<eos> My name is Katherine Rhumor.<eos> I'm so sorry to bother you like this.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I was wondering if I could talk to you about your husband.<eos> I'm not married.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> About your late husband Gerald Bradley?<eos> You knew Gerald?<eos> No, I-I didn't.

Oh, no! Oh, Morgan, Morgan!<eos> Back up.<eos> - You back up. - You back up.<eos> The engagement ring!<eos> Look, this is a call to arms.<eos> I brought my black case for just such an occasion.<eos> It's in my car.<eos> Go get it for me.<eos> I don't work for you.<eos> I do work for you.
I was being selfish...<eos> With her, with Jones...<eos> Probably you, too.<eos> Look, I know the whole world doesn't revolve around me and not everyone is always gonna be there...<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> I'm not Jones, okay?<eos> I'm always gonna be there, always, no matter how many babies come into the picture... and trust me, I am not anticipating that many.<eos> No one will ever replace you to me.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I do now.
I'm only teaching one class this semester.<eos> So if you need any help, a translator or someone to speak to your family on the phone...<eos> Oh no, I couldn't do that.<eos> Sure you could.<eos> And we are going to work together.<eos> You are going to get me involved.<eos> Right?<eos> I have devoted my adult life to studying this beautiful language. and these beautiful people;<eos> I want to help.<eos> Really, I do. Thanks.
Got the manifest for the Sparrow-Hawk?<eos> Over a million in cash was on the Sparrow-Hawk.<eos> Payroll while they were at sea.<eos> They use U.S. dollars, since they're accepted at every port.<eos> Sailors get paid, come into town on leave...<eos> So, somebody switched out the CIA's marked money with the Brit" clean currency.<eos> Laundering.<eos> Malloy had access.<eos> How do we know he wasn't involved in it?<eos> We don't.
I'm so wound up.<eos> It's just I can't relax.<eos> It's just... it's hot in here.<eos> You wanna play pool?<eos> - Let's play pool.<eos> - I think you should fuck me.<eos> I...<eos> What?<eos> I'm just saying if you need to relax, then you can fuck me because I know how to calm them nerves.<eos> Yes, I do.
How did you know?<eos> I told you.<eos> I have friends at the IRS.<eos> They're on to you, Mr. Whitman.<eos> Well, if you know my former department at the IRS, then you probably know Charlie Dean.<eos> How is the old boy?<eos> Now, that must be Whitman's source inside the IRS.<eos> Yeah, we need Hardison.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
Angel.<eos> I should have broken his jaw for what he said about you.<eos> I'm not gonna argue with you.<eos> Internal affairs is coming by tomorrow, and they need to know that it's over.<eos> That there's no bad blood between you, okay?<eos> I'm not asking.<eos> Sorry if I scared you before.<eos> Maybe we can start again?<eos> You probably have a headache.<eos> The sedative does that.
- I can't do that.<eos> No, please, let me go.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't go through it again!<eos> Just kill me now.<eos> Please!<eos> Harry's right.<eos> I need a plan.<eos> How you doing, Lopez?
We'd like to thank Sammy Cacciatore for throwing this little shindig for us tonight.<eos> Yo, Alex, that's me, okay? I gotta run.<eos> Stop asking questions and just enjoy yourself, all right?<eos> Get this guy a White Russian.<eos> Shit!<eos> Oh, yay. Thanks.<eos> You see how the I-back goes in motion?<eos> They always come back...<eos> Marty, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
Mike!<eos> I was going to call you.<eos> I was talking to Paul Young.<eos> He and the new missus are really enjoying the house.<eos> - Are they?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And Paul was wondering if you would be interested in selling the place.<eos> He's willing to make a very generous offer.<eos> Lee, I never kicked your ass for renting our house to that guy 'cause you didn't know our history.<eos> But now you do.
All right.<eos> How did you get around to it, with you come with me and sleep with dirzu?<eos> Did you spell it?<eos> - No.<eos> Jinxed?<eos> Euthanized with your view?<eos> - No.<eos> Jo- se- phine<eos> wanted to.<eos> She did?
Ms. Lisbon, they just took off.<eos> - We don't know where they went. - You swear?<eos> I swear.<eos> My sister was the only good, clean, honest thing that I had in my life and you ran off with her.<eos> You took her away from me, away from what she knows so, you know, yeah, I've been mad at you, very mad.<eos> I didn't take her away.<eos> She didn't want the carny life.<eos> She hated it.<eos> She wanted to get out.<eos> We both did.
This is the same poison that you gave him!<eos> You met with him, you gave him something to drink.<eos> And then he died.<eos> Now, how much time passed?<eos> Who are you?<eos> How much time, Kent?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> 15... 15, 20...<eos> What? I don't... 15 minutes.
You know what I don't get it, rossi, what I just can't wrap my brain around?<eos> No, what's that?<eos> How this could have been consensual.<eos> Don't sit down.<eos> Don't sit down.<eos> Consensual, huh?<eos> What does that look like?<eos> How do you get a nice girl like Kate to do both of you in the same night?<eos> She liked it.<eos> What did she like?
She liked it.<eos> What did she like?<eos> What, did she do both of you at once?<eos> Come on, you know that.<eos> Did you take turns?<eos> What?<eos> I mean, you said she liked it.<eos> But what?<eos> What did she like? You know, man.<eos> No, I don't.
Only one way to find out.<eos> Okay, and by that you mean talking to him, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Because if it is his shadow that's doing this, confronting him in the light would be a really bad idea, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's this about, officer?<eos> We know about the Dark Man.<eos> You caught him?<eos> You know who it is.<eos> No, I don't.
Hey!<eos> Look ahead!<eos> If you end up breaking the plant, it'll be irreversible!<eos> Letting Gasback get away is a bigger problem!<eos> Out of the way!<eos> Move!<eos> Don't do it! Whoa!<eos> Are you crazy? ! Wait!<eos> Wait a sec!<eos> Don't do it, Amelia!
- I hear you're afraid of Max Hansen.<eos> - Ah, screw it.<eos> Normally I'd try to act all manly, but, yeah, I'm terrified.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> - Make it a lot easier on you if he was dead, wouldn't it?<eos> - Are you offering?<eos> - Where were you earlier, Duke?<eos> - Oh, did somebody take care of my little problem?<eos> - Just answer the question.<eos> - They did?
But you used to work for scanlon trust.<eos> Hey, I ran my division ethically and responsibly.<eos> Scanlon took down so many innocent people, didn't he?<eos> Don't try to twist my words around...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, that's true.<eos> But where others would be bitter, you've moved on.<eos> Now you're a nanny.<eos> Clearly, it takes a man who is totally secure In his masculinity to take on a job like this.<eos> Actually, it does.
Really?<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> Yeah, shirt, tie, doughnut crumbs.<eos> You missed a spot.<eos> Look, you're never gonna fit in here looking like you're from the mainland.<eos> Who says I want to fit in?<eos> I don't want to fit in, I want to look like<eos> I'm from the mainland.<eos> Okay? I got 87 homicide cases under my belt looking like this.<eos> Not in 110-degree weather, you don't.
Remember him?<eos> Float like a butterfly, sting like a what?<eos> Bee!<eos> That's what I'm talking about, man.<eos> Hey, Charlie!<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Listen, we got off on the wrong foot the other day.<eos> What do you say I help you out, huh?<eos> I don't need any help, kid.<eos> Yeah, you kind of do, Charlie.
I've been here for a week now, and now that I'm all settled in, it would really help me out if we got an Internet hookup.<eos> And before you say no, I pay for it.<eos> No.<eos> You're not even gonna consider it?<eos> Oh, I do consider it.<eos> I consider it a no.<eos> - Why can't we get the Internet?<eos> - We don't need Internet.<eos> Well, I do.
Great.<eos> Fever's way up.<eos> Sat's way down.<eos> Pustules still spreading.<eos> Interferon's not working.<eos> Which means this is smallpox.<eos> Right!<eos> 'Cause there are only two diseases in the whole wide world-- what else could it be?<eos> There's got to be something.<eos> No, there doesn't.
And he just keeps saying, you know, "it sounds good, sounds good."<eos> So I... I don't know.<eos> I guess that means that it...<eos> - Sounds good to him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, Charlotte and Cooper don't seem to care.<eos> And... and Sheldon's more excited about the fact that there's a cookie drawer up here than a possibility of a 2-shrink practice.<eos> I...<eos> Did you expect more resistance?<eos> I don't...
Even after all this?<eos> Would you...<eos> I'd be happy to.<eos> Careful.<eos> Now your humanity's showing.<eos> Mine was never in doubt.<eos> Do you want to come in?<eos> - Not really.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
Isn't that great?<eos> My system is, I just ask everybody.<eos> That's good.<eos> Hey! What's up girl.<eos> You pregnant? No.<eos> And that's why they call it the buddy system.<eos> Okay, let's get out there and find those sloots.<eos> Let's go, let's go, let's go!<eos> Hey, Joe! Joe!<eos> How you doing?
Fuck.<eos> Your buddy Quinn is on his way.<eos> Didn't sound like he wants to come.<eos> Well, you're a real popular fella.<eos> Sonya.<eos> Who's Sonya?<eos> - My nanny.<eos> - Nanny.<eos> Well, Sonya wants to know if you want a magician for the party.<eos> Of course you do.
They can make you homicidal.<eos> I know what you mean.<eos> - You wanted to see me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You wanna tell me what's going on with you and Detective Morgan?<eos> - Obviously, you've been talking about the barrel girls case.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> We found some new evidence.<eos> You and Detective Morgan.<eos> She did. In the file room.
He said if we ever needed anything, to be in touch.<eos> Yes. Uh, he-- well, he's with a patient ght now.<eos> Would-- would you like- I suppose I could just tell you.<eos> Look, I don't have kids. It's a choice I made a long time ago.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> I-I understand. It can be a big adjustment,<eos> But sometimes-- and when dell died and I took betsey in, I did it because it was the right thing to do.<eos> But I can't keep her.<eos> Is it wrong that I want to punch aunt monica?<eos> On several levels, but so do I.
But you're always good with referrals,<eos> And so I just thought maybe-- we could help him come to terms with this.<eos> He hasn't let go at all.<eos> Amelia will be honest with him.<eos> Oh.<eos> Uh, bright lights don't do much for georgie.<eos> But she likes being talked to.<eos> See?<eos> You can say it's just a reflex.<eos> All the other doctors did.
I- is that-- the baby's heartbeat.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know how this happened.<eos> It's pretty clear how it happened.<eos> We've never had a problem like this here.<eos> We screen every staff member.<eos> We do background checks.
About Louie Suarez.<eos> He don't work for me no more.<eos> Yeah, well, he's a witness in a murder investigation.<eos> Yeah? Well, that's bad business on Webster Avenue.<eos> Maybe he got some career counseling.<eos> Yeah? From who, Pablo Torres?<eos> Yo, everybody knows about Pablo.<eos> Why you gotta ask me?<eos> Because he came to your fruit stand gunning for Louie Suarez.<eos> Nah, he don't.
Can--<eos> Can we-- can we just go a little slower?<eos> What?<eos> Um, can you-- can-- Can we please just go a little s-slower?<eos> I just- - I need-<eos> - I'm-- what-- what-- need?<eos> What? What do you need? What-- what do you need from me?<eos> You want to screw?<eos> Let's screw.<eos> Y- you don't?
King and I drove up from North Carolina three years ago.<eos> Weren't even dating yet.<eos> Just really good friends with something in common.<eos> Both dying to move to New York.<eos> Okay, so, uh, when did King become your boyfriend?<eos> Somewhere around Maryland.<eos> He pulled over by the side of the road, said he couldn't go any further till he told me his secret.<eos> And then he kissed me.<eos> It was one of those kisses, you know? Yeah.<eos> Afraid I do.
Are you not over-reacting?<eos> I want to be sure, you know?<eos> Whatever you think.<eos> But why would they come here if you're not here. They won't.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Look, this will all be over soon, okay?<eos> I've a pain in my hole.<eos> I get the cage rage, you know? With them little rich kids. Strutting around like he owns the place.<eos> He does own the place.<eos> He does in his bollix.
Can you stand being poor again?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I'm sure you'll be back begging me for a job.<eos> You're just a stupid bitch who kills men for money.<eos> I work hard for my debt-ridden dad.<eos> What? Not for your little brothers?<eos> Not for your paraplegic mother?<eos> At the interview you said you're saving to open a nail salon.<eos> You spit out lies as easily as you breathe, you bitch.<eos> No, I don't...
Welcome to my humble abode.<eos> Uh, would you like something to drink?<eos> I have coffee, tea, water.<eos> Whiskey sounds good.<eos> Certainly.<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Been a long time.<eos> So I believe we need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
- Good.<eos> Your pride is killing my men.<eos> - You were given gifts. Use them.<eos> - Those gifts are a trap!<eos> - I don't care what they are.<eos> Use them. - No.<eos> I will not use that sword or anything that they give me!<eos> So we'll just continue to die.<eos> I can't become like them.<eos> If I do this, I do it as a man.
Carly.<eos> You know what your problem is, Derek?<eos> You can't say "what if."<eos> And you never will.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Who wants to hear some good news?<eos> I do.
They don't have cell service up there?<eos> Well, apparently not on this island.<eos> So, Wally, Sebastian wanted to go and spend the weekend with Liam.<eos> And since he's been having some trouble making friends, I let him do it.<eos> But then Liam's mom called me and told me that Sebastian has lice. - Lice?<eos> - Calm down, Wally, it's lice.<eos> I did not say leprosy, okay?<eos> Would you please not Wally this into a situation worse than it already is?<eos> Hang on, did you just use my name as a verb?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I did.
That's my grandfather.<eos> - Which one, right here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This guy?<eos> He's my father's dad.<eos> He owns a boat.<eos> He takes it out every day to go fishing for sharks.<eos> And he knows a lot.<eos> Did you know that sharks don't have bones?<eos> No, but I do now.
- He's getting juice. - No, he's not.<eos> Danny, look at this.<eos> Now, Danny, I'm gonna tell you a secret, okay?<eos> When you go back down, I want you to give Mom a big kiss, okay? Ready?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> That was high!<eos> - He's getting juice. - You want any cake?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Do we have cake today?<eos> - Yeah, we do. - Yes.
She'll say, "Why is your hair white, young lady?<eos> You look very odd."<eos> I would say to your grandmother, my hair is white because when I was born I was not awake.<eos> My mother and father could not get me to make a sound or move.<eos> So they prayed for days to the Moon Spirit and dipped me into the sacred waters.<eos> My parents said that my hair turned white then and life poured into me.<eos> Wow.<eos> You didn't tell me that.<eos> You didn't ask me.<eos> Only your grandmother did.
He wants to fight you so he can capture you, Zuko.<eos> Walk away!<eos> Come!<eos> You stand alone.<eos> And that has always been your great mistake.<eos> Water teaches us acceptance.<eos> Let your emotions flow like water.<eos> Aang?<eos> They want you to be their Avatar, Aang.<eos> We all do.
Let us put these French to bed!<eos> Raise the barricades!<eos> Make it count. Go!<eos> Move back!<eos> King Philip's arse!<eos> Look what they do for the Lion Heart!<eos> Push! That'll burn all night, lads.<eos> Don't let them put it out.<eos> These pricks will smash through in the morning, take all the credit.<eos> Well done, Jimmy boy.
But, um, truthfully,<eos> Robyn's, Robyn's better than the girl of my dreams.<eos> She's real.<eos> [Narrator] Tom walked to her apartment, intoxicated by the promise of the evening.<eos> ♪ It's all right It's all right ♪ He believed that this time... his expectations would align with reality.<eos> ♪ It's all right ♪<eos> ♪ Hey, open wide Here comes original sin ♪ You look nice. Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I like your tie. Wow!<eos> Hi. - How you doing?

But delivering WHAT?<eos> How fucking stupid are you people?<eos> What do you think?<eos> A free box of Wundawash?<eos> The virus is in the washing powder, look.<eos> It's biological.<eos> Everybody, get back.<eos> - Leave her out of it.<eos> That's my nan. - I thought she was on a cruise.<eos> Yeah... So did I.
Of course.<eos> Susan was blind. I should have realized.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> How did Jacob cope with Susan's blindness?<eos> Oh, he wouldn't have thought about it.<eos> The point is, he set her free.<eos> He gave her wings.<eos> It's much too big for just us.<eos> But we don't care, do we?<eos> We do not.
Steak is such a treat it is the world's best meat<eos> We're going to steak night we're gonna eat it right<eos> - Excuse me. Doctors? - Come on!<eos> - What is your problem, lady?<eos> - What the heck, yo?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> - We let you do your thing. - You don't interrupt.<eos> - All right, calm down.<eos> Calm down.<eos> - You don't...
I got my own garbage.<eos> You're gonna do this on your own.<eos> You're a doctor.<eos> Turk, come on. I'm desperate.<eos> Elliot, Todd and I are in the middle of teaching our interns how to do an appendectomy.<eos> Please. You just cut it out and sew him up.<eos> She's right, actually.<eos> Finish up.<eos> Look, Carla always says that making love with you is perfect.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
I don't even know how you two met.<eos> You guys!<eos> The sun's going down!<eos> It's beautiful!<eos> Well, we should get going, I guess.<eos> God it's like heaven up here.<eos> Isn't it great?<eos> Since I've broken up with Greg, things seem different somehow... more colourful, more real.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> Do you?
Fair enough. Let's get out of here.<eos> I'm not going with you, peter.<eos> Why not?<eos> Maybe you're ready to move on, But I'm not.<eos> I'm not ready to forgive myself.<eos> Not yet.<eos> We can never let this happen again.<eos> Not ever.<eos> No one can know about us.<eos> They already do.
How do I find Adam?<eos> What have you got? - I don't have anything.<eos> We always have something.<eos> We? Figure of speech.<eos> Just start at the beginning.<eos> December 28th, 2000, Adam Blue is born.<eos> The next day, he disappears from his hospital bed in Albuquerque.<eos> Remains with his wrist ID end up near the Mexican border six months later. The authorities assumed the kidnappers escaped across the border.<eos> Well, they wanted a closed case.<eos> The Feds'll do that.
We don't have time for that.<eos> He should have went before we left Stony Creek.<eos> He isn't pleased with your attitude.<eos> Really?<eos> Is that the way he feels?<eos> You remind him that I'm a man and he's a dog.<eos> And I'm not about to have this or any conversation with a dog.<eos> So my answer is still no.<eos> Junkyard says thank you.<eos> Did he, now?
Yeah, I got a lawyer.<eos> SARA:<eos> You're suing us?<eos> Well' honey, What the hell is going on?<eos> I don't want to do it anymore' Mom.<eos> You don't Want to do it anymore?<eos> That's it? You don't want to do it?<eos> Νo.<eos> Guess what?<eos> Νeither do I and neither does Kate.
I'm glad it's over.<eos> I couldn't have brought him here.<eos> It's too tacky!<eos> Stop it.<eos> I never told him you're a cleaner.<eos> I don't want to end up like you!<eos> Lisa, go to bed.<eos> You both disgust me!<eos> You're right. I ruin everything.<eos> Don't.

Fifteen thousand a shipment.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, am I being unfair?<eos> How I know you ain't looking to set me up?<eos> Tomorrow I'll bring you some information. Small shit.<eos> You decide if you wanna go to the next step.<eos> What about the murders?<eos> You don't give the fuck about them no more?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Now look at you.<eos> I never did.
I don't think I have any other plans, so sounds good.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Cool.<eos> Now you're talking.<eos> Oh, that is the one.<eos> Yeah, it would be, but she's not going.<eos> What do you mean I can't go?<eos> You're the one that promised Lorelai that Hannah would be the guest of honor at the mayor's lobster hoo-hah tonight.<eos> - Actually, Lilly did.
You poisoned him, because you do not pos stand to see them succeed as beyond the Alsi.<eos> Ghosts hate existence.<eos> You have always been ghosts.<eos> They will destroy you.<eos> You want the Israelis to get their hands on it?<eos> You want to come here... and to buy all the land?<eos> Kill him!<eos> I can not kill.<eos> - Kill it, Vlad!<eos> - Do it yourself.
Either you kill it, or it will kill you.<eos> Is that clear.<eos> Dora?<eos> My God! What are you doing in here?<eos> -What are you doing in here?<eos> -Back to bed, it's a surprise.<eos> Have I forgotten my own birthday or what?<eos> I know how hard it is for you to leave everything here.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Okay, perhaps I don't.
$17.5 split?<eos> Works for me.<eos> - So tell me you have the formula.<eos> - I thought you had it.<eos> - I asked you first.<eos> - You asked me first?<eos> If I told you I loved you, would it make any difference?<eos> If you told me or if I believed you?<eos> I love you.<eos> I really do.
This is way too bizarre for me to miss out on.<eos> Excuse me. We're here to see Sofi Kozma. We called earlier.<eos> Yeah, if you could please sign in.<eos> She is on the third floor, room 307.<eos> Let's go.<eos> God, it smells like diarrhea in there.<eos> Look at the munchkin lady.<eos> That guy's wearing a diaper.<eos> God, I never want to get old.<eos> No one does.
What the hell was that?<eos> One second she's fine, and then she does a bitch flip.<eos> How did she know I was a twin?<eos> She's crazy.<eos> She probably has Old Timer's!<eos> No.<eos> No, she knew something.<eos> Come on, get real.<eos> What if she does?<eos> She doesn't!
Baby, come here, you'll like it, believe me.<eos> - Okay, let's get down to business. - No, no, no.<eos> Okay, just for a second, then.<eos> - No, no, no. - Come on.<eos> - Ow! - Oh, sorry.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Jesus, honey.<eos> Damn it.<eos> We have to talk about last night.<eos> - Do we?
- Did you move?<eos> - I do not, and you?<eos> - Yes, I moved the ...<eos> - Guys, look.<eos> Damn!<eos> - My God ...<eos> - I had you right tackle.<eos> Do not you know better than to messing with a spirit board?<eos> Come on Gus, it's just a game. It does not.<eos> They do it!
Ah... finally.<eos> We're done for!<eos> THEY'RE done for!<eos> All right, Countess?<eos> Τhank you, Hubert.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Μy pleasure.<eos> We narrowly avoided a catastrophe.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> You definitely do everything well, Ηubert.
He came to us as an orphan Like the gentle wind, building strength through training and dedication<eos> Learn from Casey!<eos> But neither is complete until he masters the virtues of the other<eos> Casey-san.<eos> Thanks, Kiko.<eos> You are always working so late more than anyone else.<eos> I guess I'm not so good at sitting still.<eos> And not so good at boast, neither.<eos> Well, your father seems to think I have potential.<eos> So does someone else.
Is Greg okay?<eos> He's fine.<eos> He's upstairs.<eos> You've been asleep for a couple of hours.<eos> I had this terrible dream.<eos> What about?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> I wouldn't worry.<eos> Apparently bad dreams cure you of real life stress.<eos> As indeed does champagne.
Is that not the bathroom?<eos> You know what, never mind. I can hold it.<eos> Unless you wanna fork over one of those evidence bags. Gimme a little privacy? Out!<eos> Okay.<eos> As far as we can tell, no one has entered or exited the building.<eos> Okay, we've done a complete search and we have alibis from all staff present.<eos> - And?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I think it's time to have another talk with detective Lassiter.<eos> Don't you, chief?
I also see that you've been putting in quite a lot of overtime lately.<eos> Not to mention, you have a higher than normal incidence of discharging your weapon.<eos> And you were overheard saying you should have taken him out when you had the chance.<eos> Are you saying I am actually a suspect?<eos> You've got to be kidding me!<eos> We need to do a gun residue swab to make sure that it wasn't you who fired the weapon.<eos> We're just making sure.<eos> Fine, but I am telling you you are wasting your time.<eos> - Chief, we need to speak.<eos> - No, we don't.

Sir, are you suffering from amnesia?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe. I think.<eos> Or something like that. Great. Leave it to Lyin' Ryan to find the only amnesiac in Santa Barbara.<eos> Although, I won't be the only amnesia person much longer, I'm getting my memory back.<eos> A little bit each day.<eos> Look, Lieber. Tom.<eos> I never forgot that.<eos> How wonderful for you. We think you may be in grave danger.<eos> No, we don't.

Tom.<eos> I never forgot that.<eos> How wonderful for you. We think you may be in grave danger.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Yes, we do.
And, dude, if your psychic powers disappear, Vick won't need to hire us anymore.<eos> There's no way we can subsist on the private jobs we get.<eos> How many times must we go through this?<eos> I am this close to getting on the Pro Bowlers Tour.<eos> I am not doing this.<eos> Okay. I get it.<eos> We have to make nice with the Chief.<eos> Why do you think I brought along this peace offering?<eos> You really think that one container of fries cuatro quesos, dos fritos is going to fix everything?<eos> Yes, I do.
Piotr, I wanted to tell you...<eos> I'll park.<eos> I didn't call. We're seeing you tonight.<eos> But you're fine.<eos> Don't worry, you're fine.<eos> And Mélanie's coming.<eos> We've brought a great Bordeaux!<eos> We'll talk tonight.<eos> See you in a moment.<eos> He did some tests.
- Very funny. - Not to me.<eos> - Come on, it's hilarious!<eos> - I never asked you.<eos> I wasn't here.<eos> How did you dress her?<eos> - Dress who?<eos> - Dress Mom. In her coffin.<eos> [laughter]<eos> - This is no time... - I missed a lot.<eos> - I didn't.
And that's where he got her pregnant.<eos> Chris!<eos> - Can you open this?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Your parents have chosen a very special island.<eos> - Just give us some advice and tips.<eos> - Of course, will do.<eos> No problem.<eos> - Tell me, does Hans read that?<eos> - No, he doesn't.
I'm not sure.<eos> Yes or no?<eos> No.<eos> Pretend we're a couple.<eos> You mean if I was at home with my sister, I'd be dead by now?<eos> It's so unbelievable. I'm alive because I happened to be out.<eos> And you better wake up by yourself if you want to stay alive.<eos> What did you say?<eos> You heard me.<eos> Of course I did.
He goes on and on. it's just--<eos> Yeah, well, you're still not telling me what he said.<eos> - Yeah, I know, 'cause you know why?<eos> - Why? 'Cause I got dizzy... twice.<eos> Oh, fuck. You're getting dizzy spells? You're getting dizzy spells<eos> - and you're not telling me? - A little bit. Angie, you cannot do that.<eos> 'Cause it's the fucking mold in these walls. That's what it is. You know it is.<eos> It gets to your asthma. It goes into your lungs. No no no, baby.<eos> I'm calling Mrs. Vincent right now. Sal, I don't need anything.<eos> I really don't. Just you, babe.
It's just a human, so they can run for it.<eos> We gotta hold her off.<eos> -We're okay.<eos> -Danny, Ted, we gotta go.<eos> -I'm good.<eos> -Danny?<eos> Come on!<eos> -Danny, we gotta go.<eos> -Told you it was some crazy bitch.<eos> -Yes, you did.
Now, I really wish I knew how to kill you.<eos> But all I can do is send you back to heaven.<eos> [CHANTING IN LATIN]<eos> [GRUNTS]<eos> Oh....<eos> Stupid pet tricks.<eos> Who's murdering the angels?<eos> How are they doing it?<eos> You think I'm gonna tell you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You tried it?<eos> Phenomenal. Detoxes you like nobody's business.<eos> When you were in that bathroom with Ian did you see something?<eos> I don't know. I don't know what I saw.<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you saying that--?<eos> Did you see a ghost?<eos> I was freaking out.<eos> The guy penciled his damn neck.<eos> You did, didn't you?
Hal?<eos> You hear me?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hal?<eos> Can you hear me, Hal?<eos> I know how you feel. Hal.<eos> I told you to shut up.<eos> Hal! Can you hear me?<eos> I mean I know how you feel about your missing son.<eos> No, you don't. No, you fucking don't.
No, you don't. No, you fucking don't.<eos> When I was six, my parents were killed.<eos> Murdered.<eos> I was in the house.<eos> And I could hear my mother's screams.<eos> I heard the gunshot.<eos> You know what that's like for a little boy?<eos> To find the bodies of his parents, his guardians, still warm, lying in a mess of their own blood?<eos> Do you know what it's like to be six and realize, for the first time, that you're alone in the world?<eos> Do you?
Hey, yourself.<eos> So listen.<eos> My....<eos> My name is not really Jesse Jackson.<eos> It's Jesse Pinkman.<eos> And that guy you met he's not my dad.<eos> You're not gonna kick me out, are you?<eos> Because I actually really like it here.<eos> I don't make it my business what you do.<eos> So long as you don't do it here.
Don't move. Stay down.<eos> I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing.<eos> I'd better call Saul!<eos> I was out partying, minding my own business...<eos> - You are under arrest.<eos> - I'd better call Saul!<eos> Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.<eos> Did you know that you have rights?<eos> The Constitution says you do.<eos> And so do I.
No, something else.<eos> We should go somewhere.<eos> Have you been to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?<eos> Is that the one with the A-bombs?<eos> Georgia O'Keeffe.<eos> She's a painter.<eos> You've never heard of Georgia O'Keeffe?<eos> No, is that bad?<eos> - Boy, you need some educating.<eos> - Yes, yes, I do.
She didn't do a thing.<eos> I sold everything.<eos> You?<eos> Sorry I didn't recognize you.<eos> It's OK.<eos> Know the girl who works next door?<eos> - Chapulina.<eos> - Does she still work there?<eos> Go to bed, Betty.<eos> Does she?
It's a masterpiece.<eos> I could screen it in the living room this weekend..<eos> Sounds great.<eos> We could subject the whole family.<eos> Louise Brooks is about to be murdered.<eos> Her sexual indiscretions will not go unpunished. Honey?<eos> Is there anything you wanna tell me?<eos> Did he call?<eos> Did who called me?<eos> - He didn't? - Who?
- That's the formula for the fluid.<eos> - You found it.<eos> - It worked.<eos> - What did?<eos> The thermal imaging.<eos> That facility is storing a large amount of something at the temperature we were tracking.<eos> Let's assume we're right, and the existing formula is there.<eos> I'll go, add your bacteria to the fluid... and get out before anyone knows I was there.<eos> I wish I could go with you.<eos> I do, too.
The contractions are just her cervix dilatingso the baby can come out. We still have some time.<eos> - I can go get help.<eos> - No,no,you shouldn'tleave her.<eos> - I'll go.<eos> - Walk three stepswithout limping.<eos> Look,we may not like it,but we're just gonna have tosit tight until help comes.<eos> - Here's another thing.<eos> - About the baby?<eos> You can't delay laboronce it starts.<eos> So,if the baby comesbefore help does?
It would help if we had a record of Sarah's calls.<eos> So Sarah was always on the run. She wasn't the kind - of person to use a regular cell phone.<eos> - Isn't.<eos> - What?<eos> - She isn't the kind of person.<eos> You're right.<eos> We still don't know anything for sure.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He wanted Andy to move in with us?<eos> Yeah, he did.
You're OK.<eos> I'm here with you.<eos> What happens next?<eos> I saw the letter.<eos> I read the letter.<eos> She said she left.<eos> She couldn't be my mother anymore.<eos> But Sarah didn't write the letter.<eos> Remember?<eos> - Cassidy did.
You didn't know.<eos> She's dead.<eos> My mother is dead.<eos> I don't know what they said but it wasn't...<eos> Apparently, it wasn't what I thought it would be.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> OK, so she's kind of adorable.<eos> You've always been a sucker for cute and smart.<eos> - We wanted to sabotage you.<eos> - We did.
What did she get?<eos> We may have something here.<eos> Wow.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Jeez, can you believe that?<eos> Wow, Shannon, that was awesome. You so rule.<eos> She, uh, got lucky.<eos> - Shannon!<eos> Mom! Mom, did you see me? Did you see me?<eos> I sure did!
My name is Gunther.<eos> And you?<eos> Mine not.<eos> ("Choking On A Marshmallow" plays again)<eos> Yes, a lot of fun.<eos> I already have ...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Could I perhaps Also use the "Wide Chest Press"?<eos> You sit here so dreamy.<eos> And I still did not today. ..
And on the weekend we go together into the Park<eos> - watch People. ..<eos> - (Jerome) Nice.<eos> Good, which is after all.<eos> What I told you.<eos> And you?<eos> How is it?<eos> Do you have a relationsh...<eos> Ah. ..<eos> Did you also. ..
- You need a thing.<eos> - What do you mean, a thing?<eos> You know, something that makes you fun and well-liked, like Marcus Denisco.<eos> Marcus Denisco worked in account services and was perhaps the most expendable employee at the company.<eos> I brought some donuts.<eos> They're probably stupid.<eos> But eventually, he came to be known as...<eos> Food Guy!<eos> Who wants some pulled pork?<eos> Of course you do!
- But you did.<eos> - Brad came to me of his own free will.<eos> He was drawn to Wicca.<eos> I couldn't turn him away.<eos> How does he feel about the spell you put on his brother?<eos> He's at peace with it.<eos> That's why we were conducting the cleansing ritual.<eos> Brad knows the difference between the world of magic and the real world.<eos> He understands I didn't kill his brother.<eos> Because, in the real world, Brad did it.
- Mr. Piggott?<eos> - Mrs. Myshkin.<eos> - Oh, your poor mum.<eos> Sad you couldn't see more of her.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How's Michael?<eos> - You heard about that little girl?<eos> - What little girl?<eos> - Hazel Atkins.<eos> - Yeah, oh, yeah, I did, yeah.
- I see it at night.<eos> I see it all the time.<eos> It won't go away.<eos> I told you.<eos> I told you a long time ago.<eos> I could have saved them.<eos> I could have.<eos> - It's not your fault, Michael.<eos> It's not your fault. - I told you.<eos> I did, didn't I?
I could have.<eos> - It's not your fault, Michael.<eos> It's not your fault. - I told you.<eos> I did, didn't I?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> - I told.<eos> And you said for me not to say. You said.<eos> - I said if you told them, that you would never see your mum again, didn't I? I said if you told them, you'd spend the rest of your life in prison.<eos> - You did.
- 24 hours, not a thing.<eos> - There's been a couple now, aren't there?<eos> - Yeah, going back. Wasn't there a little lass from Rochdale?<eos> - There were one not so long ago in Castleford.<eos> - Yeah, Jeanette Garland.<eos> Never found her neither. - No?<eos> Didn't they?<eos> - Hear them wheels.<eos> - They never caught no one.<eos> - Never do, though, do they?
I couldn't say.<eos> We'll wait.<eos> Is that a beer?<eos> We're not in a position to confirm that.<eos> Your new shoes are pretty.<eos> Aren't they?<eos> Daddy bought them for mommy--<eos> He doesn't know it yet--<eos> Because he has a wonderful new job.<eos> He doesn't that yet either.
- Yeah.<eos> We did my thing for seven years, now it's your turn.<eos> Do you know how embarrassed I would've been if Bruce had seen you take it?<eos> - He deserved it.<eos> He insulted me.<eos> - So say something, stand up to him.<eos> But stealing?<eos> Honestly, Orson, why would you do something like that?<eos> I don't know, Bree.<eos> I don't.
- You got in?<eos> - You're the Constance student?<eos> Cancel the Nelly Yuki project, now.<eos> S, why would you turn down Yale?<eos> And don't say for me because even I wouldn't believe you.<eos> - Why would you do that?<eos> I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you.<eos> You don't want to go?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
"These distances..."<eos> "Distance in our paths."<eos> "Distance in our vision."<eos> "Distance between fellow travellers."<eos> "Destroy all these distances."<eos> "These distances..."<eos> "It has happened." "Even on an empty road..." "...you were by my side."<eos> "Once after meeting you..." "My heart returned..." "But empty-handed."<eos> "It has also happened."<eos> "Like it did just now."
It's only a matter of time before someone comes down.<eos> I can't just leave her, Isabella.<eos> - We've got a chance to escape...<eos> - Robin!<eos> ... to escape our old lives.<eos> We've got to take this chance.<eos> Listen!<eos> What we talked about down there, the dream, it can be our dream, our reality...<eos> - Isabella I like you.<eos> I really do.
I ain't your daddy.<eos> You can drink yourself into a coma as far as I'm concerned, but you're taking me down with you, then it's my problem.<eos> You know, you talk too much.<eos> You ought to just go skip some rope.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, go skip some rope.<eos> You want me to skip something?<eos> Hey, hey, hey. I'll skip your drunk ass off this marble floor.<eos> Okay, okay. I need to, um, speak to Nate alone.<eos> Yeah. You do that.
She wanted to go steady?<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> I didn't.<eos> Why didn't you want to?<eos> It was boring.<eos> All she did was roller-skate.<eos> Every Sunday she asked me to go with her.<eos> I didn't want to.<eos> Why not?<eos> I just didn't.
Exactly.<eos> Why is that, Mr Frobisher?<eos> He keeps saying the same thing, over and over.<eos> We are coming.<eos> I don't mean to scare you.<eos> You're perfectly safe but I think aliens are using you to speak.<eos> What do you think?<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> How do we know that the 456 will keep quiet?<eos> We don't.
Then I take it that that leaves the Blank Page with me?<eos> Just don't tell me about it.<eos> Tell her it's in the bottom drawer, I put them there yesterday, yeah?<eos> Oh, I thought so.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> How's things?<eos> Terrifying.<eos> Uncle Jack!<eos> Steven!<eos> Hey, soldier, how you doing?
You're just gonna go now?<eos> Oh, sit down, you daft sod.<eos> I've got some of that spinach dip.<eos> And you and me, well, we've got things to talk about.<eos> What things? You've been seen.<eos> They said on the news that we should send them back to school tomorrow.<eos> D'you think it's safe?<eos> Well, I don't know any more than you.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I don't.
Sophie...<eos> Just take the mob out of it.<eos> What? Take the mob out of it?<eos> Hear me out. Isn't this just a breach of contract?<eos> I mean, these guys had a deal, right?<eos> And your boy, Ray, he lived up to his end, but Moscone didn't.<eos> For that, there's not a court of law in this world this lady can go to.<eos> Which is exactly the kind of case we take.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I don't...
No, no, I think it went as well as it could but, but Jordan.<eos> Please, you gotta have your dad talk to the three guys from Munich. The three younger guys, you know were, weren't there when I had my, uh.<eos> Shall I lay out his clothes out from him, too? Or do you think you can handle it?<eos> Yes, sir... roger, I got that, colonel, yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Hey, I like this.<eos> So, uh, about this weekend. Yves? Would you turn the sauna up as high it'll go, please?<eos> Yeah? Look, I don't really think Allyson wants me up there with her, all right?<eos> Oh, yes, she does.
Yeah, you did. Which is interesting, actually. Because, um, your counsel to me was, uh.<eos> I say a whole bunch of shit, you know.<eos> Some of it's even the truth. Oh, yeah.<eos> That's good. Yeah?<eos> Yeah. Is this new?<eos> Um, no. No, it's old. It's really, actually, I think it's from when I was in eleventh grade or something.<eos> Hmm. It's still good though.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well done, huh, young man?<eos> Well done.
So, then, you know, we try to convince him to put it back up.<eos> Earnshaw ran a credit check on Alice White.<eos> Who's Alice White?<eos> You are.<eos> Whoa!<eos> She's going to buy the jury.<eos> Not if we steal it first.<eos> Who plays chess?<eos> I play.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.
Kingly Valour, that he shall have, but on his breast I see a green stone, and from that his true name shall come and his chief renown for he shall be a healer and a renewer.<eos> Behold Aragorn, son of Arathorn,<eos> Lord of the Dúnedain!<eos> Scion of Elendil of Númenor!<eos> The Heir of Isildur!<eos> Hail Aragorn!<eos> Hail Aragorn!<eos> By the valour of the Lord and his Rangers, the Dúnedain had a measure of peace.<eos> Seems but yesterday that your son Halbarad was Aragorn's age.<eos> It does indeed, my lord.
Hollow.<eos> How long would it take to press a case?<eos> Thousand rounds... A couple hours.<eos> Who says you can't make an honest deal with the white man?<eos> There's something else.<eos> Mushrooms.<eos> Fair price.<eos> Psychedelic<eos> Ah, we don't deal, chief.<eos> Then neither do we.
Shit.<eos> That bitch still has your insurance card.<eos> I got it.<eos> Where the hell is that deadbeat hospital?<eos> Find out.<eos> - What do you want me to do, ask...?<eos> - Find out.<eos> Ask whoever's in there.<eos> Clay said your task is to be my bitch.<eos> - Yeah, he did.
What?<eos> This is a hostile work environment claim filed against me and myproxy by Margaret Murphy.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> - What a bunch of pussies.<eos> - You threatened her.<eos> I had a passionate conversation with her in the elevator.<eos> This is my livelihood!<eos> Do you have any idea how hard I've worked to get to where I am?<eos> I get it.<eos> Do you?
Captain Industry should be behind bars, but now I'm here.<eos> Arthur, why is it so important that you capture Captain Industry?<eos> He killed my mother.<eos> When will I see Mommy again?<eos> You won't.<eos> How many times do I have to say it?<eos> Could you hold that still, please, or I'll bash you.<eos> Why?<eos> Drugs.<eos> The drugs did her in.
Wow, that's so romantic... two struggling musicians living in poverty and despair, selling their instruments.<eos> I know it sounds good, but it's actually pretty dressing.<eos> All our utilities were cut off because Bret bought a cup.<eos> Oh, well, I could give you guys some money.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Thanks, mel.<eos> I mean, you would have to earn it, of course.<eos> I mean, I wouldn't insult you by giving you charity.<eos> What do we have to do?<eos> Do you guys... do massage?
Silly.<eos> You sure you're going to be happy on that thing?<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> I'm good.<eos> All right.<eos> Good night.<eos> Night, night.<eos> Night, everyone.<eos> Look, Paul, I know how hard you're trying.<eos> Really, I do.
what do you mean?<eos> Well, sometimes she wakes up, thinks she's 3, Wants to know where her dolly is.<eos> Yesterday, she was talking to our dad.<eos> He died five years ago.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, this was a mistake. i...<eos> I shouldn't have come.<eos> Of course.<eos> Why would you want to stay?<eos> Daniel certainly didn't.
- When he's out, he's out. - Yeah.<eos> At least one of us can sleep.<eos> It's gonna take more than two nights... for me to get used to sleeping in a normal bed.<eos> What are we gonna do about him?<eos> About Aaron.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about him.<eos> Did you know that Claire was flying to L.A. to give him up for adoption?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
It knows our nameses.<eos> Yes, I know your name.<eos> You're coming with me to the North.<eos> We'll put out it's eyes!<eos> We'll ring it's filthy neckses!<eos> We wouldn't hurt a fly, we promises we'll be very nice.<eos> Let us out<eos> Gollum, you need to answer me truthfully.<eos> I know you were looking for something.<eos> No, it doesn't.
And if there was methane, I didn't know about it. That's the truth.<eos> I know you didn't, because you showed true surprise when you were accused.<eos> Everybody here was surprised, outraged... except for one.<eos> One person was relieved.<eos> When a guilty person sees someone accused of the crime that they committed... they show relief.<eos> Your father tried to bring a factory to Frostburg when he was mayor, and he couldn't.<eos> Is that how you found out about the methane?<eos> I never thought anything like this could happen.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I didn't.
I... i spoke to mr. Murch, and he spoke of, um... lachlan's death.<eos> My sympathies. Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I remember when my father died.<eos> He was, um... he was a tough man. We didn't get along. Even so, it took me a long time to come to terms with his passing.<eos> I threw myself into work so i wouldn't have to.<eos> Was this recent?<eos> Recent enough.<eos> Then you understand.<eos> I do.
Where are you?<eos> We're at a wake... a fake wake.<eos> The whole place was wired, every house in the neighborhood.<eos> Every move anyone ever made was being watched. Skynet work camp.<eos> This is how they were set up.<eos> People working for the machines monitored by other people working for the machines.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> I need to know what they were building in that plant.<eos> I need to know who owned it, and i need to know right now.<eos> I don't...
Like the king himself, who rose from meager beginnings as a soldier to a monarch beloved by his kingdom, the new capital at Shiloh has risen up from the wreckage of war, and become a beacon of hope for our people.<eos> There you go, boys.<eos> Our taxes went into rebuilding that full city for twenty years.<eos> At least you'll be able to tell your grandkids, "I saw it happen."<eos> Except for David.<eos> He missed it.<eos> - Who was in the shop, anyways?<eos> - Reverend Samuels.<eos> - Who wants pancakes?<eos> - I do.
Even if I were Albanian, I'm not like you.<eos> -We are different, right?<eos> -We are not the same, ok?<eos> -Ok.<eos> -So, you're Albanian?<eos> -Shut up, you asshole!<eos> What about your father?<eos> He died when we were still in the North.<eos> -She said so?<eos> -Yes, she did.
-So, you're Albanian?<eos> -Shut up, you asshole!<eos> What about your father?<eos> He died when we were still in the North.<eos> -She said so?<eos> -Yes, she did.<eos> What did she tell you now?<eos> That he died in Albania, when I was one-year old.<eos> -She said so?<eos> -Yes, she did.
Now, does that just work for witches? Or can mere mortals get in too?<eos> It works for everyone, even assholes.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I'm an asshole!<eos> Do you think he joined the military to get away from me?<eos> - What?<eos> - No, honey.<eos> I mean, seriously, do you think he was trying to get out of marrying me?<eos> - No.<eos> - No. No, I do not.
How can you read?<eos> My mother taught me.<eos> I can read, Jack, because it beats what you're doing.<eos> What's that?<eos> Waiting for something to happen.<eos> And what is gonna happen?<eos> You tell me, Jack.<eos> You're the one that got to stay after school with Ms. Hawking.<eos> Did you know that Locke killed himself?<eos> No. No, I didn't.
After William killed Roy, after those men took over, lan gave me a gun for my protection.<eos> I have no idea what she's talking about.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You did it to protect me. No. No.<eos> Don't, don't, don't touch that.<eos> I'm not gonna do anything.<eos> Except get your prints on it.<eos> .38. Just like the gun that put that bullet into Roy.<eos> I never knew she had that gun.<eos> Yes, you did.
There.<eos> That look.<eos> What were you doing at the academy?<eos> I knew someday I'd be old.<eos> We'd need a younger man to run this thing.<eos> I looked at every cadet, and I chose you.<eos> I was gonna get that Tom Seybolt a little dirty so you would have to help him out.<eos> Now, that family was not supposed to die.<eos> You were not supposed to go to jail.<eos> But they did.

Did you bring Reese?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I do not trust you.<eos> You do not trust me.<eos> How do we do this?<eos> Easy.<eos> I just need you to tell me one thing.<eos> I need you to tell me why you want Rayborn.<eos> Because I do.
Rayborn and Seever, how did the police find them?<eos> Well, I told them where to look.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Come now, Mr. Earley.<eos> You and detective Crews are terribly sweet and serious gentlemen, but Mickey Rayborn's my client.<eos> Now, I must do my job, mustn't I?<eos> Rayborn told the brass you saved his life.<eos> Got you a promotion.<eos> You know why he did that, right?<eos> Yes, I do.
It was my son.<eos> Lincoln.<eos> What is this?<eos> I don't know...<eos> Just found them on the doorstep.<eos> Son of a...<eos> They lay one hand on my mama, and I swear on my life...<eos> She's in a state home.<eos> I thought we were working with these people.<eos> So did I.
- You never made her drive lead?<eos> - No! I thought that duty rotates.<eos> - You never made her drive lead?<eos> - I-I never made her drive lead!<eos> It's a lie! Sergeant, you don't have to respond.<eos> So... as long as she was in a relationship with you, she never had to drive lead.<eos> Is that right?<eos> - Sergeant Scott.<eos> - Is that right, Sergeant Scott?<eos> - Sergeant Scott, don't.
I guess people feel they need a purpose.<eos> Yeah, well, my purpose died this year at the age of 16.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Boy or a girl?<eos> Girl.<eos> She wrapped her car around a tree. Her friend got away without a scratch.<eos> What was her name?<eos> Rachel.<eos> Once you lose a child, all this striving seems kind of ridiculous, you know?<eos> Yeah, unfortunately I do.
It's pregnant.<eos> Shouldn't someone pick up that bike before it causes an...?<eos> For fuck's sake!<eos> Jesus shit!<eos> Where the fuck did that...?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Look at it!<eos> Look at it! Look at my fucking car!<eos> You saw that, didn't you?<eos> Did you?
Oh, stuff it.<eos> Let's just watch a DVD about... Oh, Christ.<eos> "How To Be Inclusive".<eos> Holy Mother of divine shite, who makes up this shit?<eos> Actually, Kieran, I'm not feeling too well either. My balls are aching.<eos> I might have to go and see that nurse. Right!<eos> Bugger off then.<eos> - Cheers, Kieran.<eos> - See if she can laser Jordan off them.<eos> Right, how the fuck does this...
- Don't you have to get to work?<eos> - No, I have the day off.<eos> - I'll spend it shaping up for you.<eos> - It's gonna be a long day, then, huh?<eos> Celeste, this shirt is newly ironed.<eos> - Dad, will you sing to me?<eos> - No, I don't have time.<eos> - Dad can't sing. - Sure, I can!<eos> - He used to sing Video Video ...<eos> - Nah. - Yes, and do this with my arm.
Leslie is unique.<eos> Government work can beat you down.<eos> I would say that I lost my optimism about government in about two months.<eos> Leslie's kept hers for six years.<eos> I've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job, and I think I'm about to break one of those rules.<eos> I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie so she can try to build a park.<eos> Why should I?<eos> You owe me one, remember?<eos> Do you want to cash in for this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Maybe I should mention her massive weight loss.<eos> You're over-thinking this.<eos> Here, I'm gonna pretend to be Janine Restrepo.<eos> Go. Hello, Madame Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo.<eos> I am Leslie Knope from the Parks...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, I'm Pawnee Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo. And I can do whatever I want.<eos> Please, tell me about this park that you badly need rezoned by me.<eos> Okay, well, I think it would be a good idea to have a multi-use community park.<eos> - Oh. Do you?
This is my son's story... and his journey into the realms of adulthood.<eos> This is the story of... "Merantau"<eos> - Assalamualaikum.<eos> Today is warmer than usual.<eos> The weather is not going to please you 'cause it's your last day here, and neither is your Mom.<eos> Now go and set the table.<eos> Listen,<eos> when Yayan came back from "Merantau," (Wandering) we were discussing the trials and tribulations of life<eos> which might have hurt his feelings.<eos> But we do this out of love and our responsibilties as your elders.
He gave me a key. I'm here to feed the fish.<eos> I don't know what the hell you're doing here.<eos> I've read about guys like this, guys in the flesh trade.<eos> They have, like, dungeons and swings and collections of swizzle sticks.<eos> A collection of swizzle sticks?<eos> - Yeah it's a thing you stir your drink.<eos> - I know what it is.<eos> What a rip-off!<eos> This looks just like myliving room.<eos> Of course it does.
Ms. Sando, do you believe Mr. Trillo has changed?<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe he's repented.<eos> He's changed his heart.<eos> And he's changed mine.<eos> That's quite a statement.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course, she doesn't believe a word she just said.<eos> Ms. Sando, do you believe Mr. Trillo has changed?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
That's right.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You asked him if you could work with me, right?<eos> Not much gets past you, does it?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Mrs. Park?<eos> Hi, I'm gillian foster.<eos> This is cal lightman.<eos> How do you do?
Maybe his eye itches. No, no. That's a gestural emblem.<eos> It's an unconscious gesture with a specific meaning.<eos> Uh, loker, pull up the politician videos with the same gestural emblem.<eos> Now, senator mccain has served this country honorably.<eos> What letter grade would you give yourself as secretary of defense?<eos> Oh, I'll let history worry about that.<eos> Now, I know why those two felt that way.<eos> The question is... why does the best man?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Wait, what's wrong with me?<eos> - Sweetie, vampires don't cry regular tears.<eos> So when you cry, you're gonna cry blood from now on.<eos> Well, why do you know that and I don't?<eos> I mean, don't you think I should know this about myself?<eos> Bill should probably have told you.<eos> Jeez, you think?<eos> Here's some tissue.<eos> Look, I don't know if it helps at all, but I think I kind of know how you feel. - At least a little.<eos> - No, you don't.
- No, don't worry.<eos> - See you soon.<eos> - So?<eos> - Nothing new.<eos> - I can stay longer if you want. - Go to your husband. Well, your future husband.<eos> Just in case.<eos> Here.<eos> Please, go ahead.<eos> I never eat Friday nights.<eos> You don't?
Sorry.<eos> Thank you for the drink.<eos> It was nice talking to you.<eos> For me too.<eos> Come back soon.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Looking for my kid.<eos> - How did you get in?<eos> - The doctor gave us keys.<eos> - Really? He did? - Yes!
Open the box.<eos> Don't get into how much it costs, I don't want you to get into some contest...<eos> -... with your girlfriends, but-<eos> - I can't go to Tampa with you.<eos> I can't go to Tampa with you.<eos> Gabriel, hit me up with the shrimp.<eos> Are you out of your fucking mind, April?<eos> My goddamn fiancé is missing.<eos> Kenny, I admit it. That I have feelings for you that I can't ignore.<eos> Something about you that does something to me.
Sorry, Gabe, I shouldn't have left them around the trailer.<eos> How dumb is that?<eos> Can I go, ma'am?<eos> - Now go win an Oscar, Gabe.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> I thought we'd worked through your doormat issues.<eos> Tell Cho to squeeze him a little.<eos> He knows things.<eos> - No, I don't.
Be back in 5. Chuck."<eos> I'm gonna kill him.<eos> Don't worry, Agent Casey, we'll take care of that.<eos> The prodigal son returns.<eos> Thank you for saving me the trouble of hunting you down.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> - Oh, great. The gang's all here.<eos> It's only fair that a son should see the results of his father's labor.<eos> Of course, if this doesn't work I'm afraid I have to go back to that bit where I kill everybody.<eos> - What if it does work?

If I wasn't being clear, I was giving you an order.<eos> If there are good reasons, find out exactly what they are.<eos> Let's keep moving, I want to see more.<eos> You should rest.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> Sir, Colonel Young's body needs time to recover.<eos> Give me something for the pain.<eos> The body feels pain for a reason.<eos> I would rather not mask it.<eos> Just do it, Lieutenant.
There's not enough time.<eos> There's just not enough time.<eos> Let me go out knowing that I did something for you.<eos> Give me that!<eos> - Let me...<eos> Linc?<eos> I'm sorry about what's ever happening to Linc.<eos> And I know you have to protect your family, I understand that, but, Michael, what are we going to do about the rest of us?<eos> What are we going to do about my wife?<eos> Alex, I don't...
- What letter?<eos> You're here, aren't you.<eos> CLARK:<eos> You're not supposed to open it yet.<eos> Can I count on you to publish that letter if anything happens to me?<eos> "Goodbye"?<eos> What do you mean, "goodbye"?<eos> Sometimes we can't outrun our destiny.<eos> But I thought you were invincible.<eos> So did I.
Sorry. The line broke.<eos> I just had a meeting with one of our developers...<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> I wanna cancel the buy.<eos> There have been certain developments in Sagen Docks that will increase the value.<eos> I would like to present those changes to you.<eos> - My lawyer advices against this.<eos> - Is he there now?<eos> - Can you speak freely?<eos> - I always do.
Maybe you flirted with him.<eos> But somehow you convinced him to rig the final tally.<eos> Years went by.<eos> You probably figured you'd never see him again.<eos> But when he read about your big book deal, Mr. Timlinson reappeared.<eos> He got greedy.<eos> He tried to shake you down.<eos> He threatened to tell the world the truth about how you really won this.<eos> You knew if you paid him, he'd eventually want more.<eos> They always do.
And now you just waltz in here, no warning, no phone call, looking like that?<eos> Didn't seem like something I wanted to share over the phone, you know? "Hey, Sean, long time no see.<eos> By the way, I'm really into meth. "<eos> I just thought it would be better just to show up and take my licks all at once, you know?<eos> - So how are Julia and the kids? - Living in New York.<eos> We're divorced.<eos> You look good.<eos> Handsome.<eos> Man, I always knew you'd be successful.<eos> Even if Dad didn't.
They're doing this for you, you know.<eos> And three people are dead.<eos> So it's got to stop now.<eos> You think I want this?<eos> I'm a young guy.<eos> Kidney failure?<eos> I don't deserve that.<eos> They're good kids.<eos> They understand that family comes first.<eos> Do you?
I've been looking for those stamps for ages.<eos> They were hidden behind the newspapers.<eos> Yes, they would have been.<eos> That's why I didn't see them.<eos> These are very old stamps here.<eos> Who knows what else we'd find here.<eos> But how can you keep these here, uncle?<eos> These are stamps from 1936 when Antioch was under French rule.<eos> This album alone is worth a fortune. You know that, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
What's important... What's important... is that we're together.<eos> NOW!<eos> Do you understand? That's what matters, and the rest...<eos> We don't give a fuck.<eos> - We're good.<eos> - Go drink a nice glass of milk.<eos> - Because I feel good. - You're all wet.<eos> I feel good. We're good.<eos> I love you so much!<eos> So do I darling'
- Have a happy birthday.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Jesus, take it easy.<eos> I didn't even ask her to watch it.<eos> And who says something like that anyway?<eos> Maybe she's trying to be constructive.<eos> I hate him? That's constructive?<eos> - I hate when people tell me they hate me.<eos> - I didn't even ask her to sleep over.<eos> - She just did.
You should be taking better care of my baby.<eos> What's the point?<eos> I can't live with this level of stress.<eos> It's killing my baby anyway.<eos> I'm dead mom walking.<eos> When am I gonna end up in a landfill?<eos> I haven't decided.<eos> Decide.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Do it.
Good, you're quiet.<eos> I like them quiet.<eos> Which I think is funny.<eos> But I just want you to know I think it's great that I'll be with you all day.<eos> I can tell you're somebody who lives the job, and that's totally me.<eos> - OK, a quick question. - Sure.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Is that a question?<eos> - I don't like chatty.<eos> I don't do chatty.
I didn't believe him.<eos> I didn't believe.<eos> Go out through the back.<eos> Uh, please, help me get outta here! Get up and walk.<eos> H-how can I get up?<eos> How can I walk?<eos> How long have I been here?<eos> You know you are Six.<eos> Please, I'm nobody. I don't know anything, please!<eos> But you do...
She ain't gonna shoot you.<eos> Would you please at least lower that gun, Miss Thornton?<eos> He is freakin' out.<eos> SOOKIE: Run!<eos> Let's go get Tara.<eos> LETTIE MAE: It's not my fault!<eos> She forgave me!<eos> Let her go!<eos> LISA: Sam, did you know my daddy?<eos> Uh, I did not.
I know someone who delivers.<eos> We'll need some proper hardware.<eos> How quick can they get here?<eos> Not quick enough.<eos> That's Thomas O'Neill.<eos> Bloodthirsty hooligan got here faster than I expected.<eos> - We need to move now.<eos> - No. - I'm gonna teach the son of a bitch... how to breathe through the top of his skull.<eos> We're outnumbered.<eos> Do the math.
The same things people are afraid of as kids... scare them when they're adults.<eos> Fear of the dark, for example.<eos> Fear of being alone.<eos> And above all, fear of the unknown.<eos> I'll go collect the toys.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is Pete.<eos> It's Erik Luna.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Damn right we do.
- None.<eos> I keep waiting for a ransom note.<eos> Something.<eos> - I'd better go post these.<eos> I'm gonna do everything I can to help you get your son back.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Can you imagine walking by your kid's empty bedroom, not knowing where he is?<eos> - No. I can't.<eos> - How does a guy like this make a dead body just disappear into thin air?<eos> - The gulf stream does the trick for me.
Sure you don't want to stay here?<eos> - you didn't raise a loner, dad.<eos> - maybe i should have.<eos> - i'll survive.<eos> - you sure?<eos> Better see to that drip, son.<eos> You don't want this place going to hell.<eos> You need it too much.<eos> - my own little vacation spot.<eos> Hey, how you guys doing up there?
I remember we were interrupted because... this bird just crashed into the window.<eos> The point is, I had a vision of Fiona Banks.<eos> Let's see if she had a vision of me.<eos> Inspector Banks.<eos> Fiona, this is Al Gough, FBI.<eos> I'm here with my colleagues in L.A.<eos> My God.<eos> Uh, I know why you're calling.<eos> You want to know what I saw.<eos> - We all do.
April?<eos> Quick, quick, something's wrong with April.<eos> You're gonna be all right. It's all right.<eos> Clear. Clear.<eos> Dr. Silver here.<eos> When are you damn kids going to learn how to hold your drugs?<eos> Boris' concierge doctor.<eos> Start with some Oxy, then a little crystal, rip a few lines, and chase it all down with champagne.<eos> "Heaven salad" you kids call it, right? What?<eos> April doesn't do drugs.
You don't have fibromyalgia.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're going to tell me that nothing is wrong with me.<eos> I hate when doctors do that.<eos> Every single day. Oh, no.<eos> There's something wrong with you, all right. Thank you.<eos> I think he's being facetious, babe.<eos> Do not patronize me, Tucker. Are you guys really only 16?<eos> I told her she doesn't have anything.<eos> Actually, she does. What?
And so much more.<eos> So... Yeah. Excuse me.<eos> Feel this.<eos> Silk.<eos> How much do you think this benefit costs?<eos> I don't know. A lot?<eos> Twice that.<eos> At least.<eos> Do you know how much these things run?<eos> I don't.
He's back.<eos> Great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. Dr Marshall is five minutes away.<eos> Ray.<eos> Notify CCU they're coming in.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Dr Marshall made a mistake with the dosage.<eos> - How did that get by you?<eos> - Well, actually, it didn't.
- Son or boyfriend?<eos> Boyfriend.<eos> Come on, be his mom.<eos> - Boyfriend!<eos> Be his mom. Be his mom.<eos> - Get in there, buddy!<eos> - Kiss her. Kiss her.<eos> Come on! - Mom. Mom.<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> Do it!
- I'll have Cesar...<eos> - That's okay.<eos> My family's coming.<eos> I'll go with them.<eos> - I...<eos> - Okay then, Mrs. Botwin.<eos> I've got your discharge paperwork all set up for you.<eos> Just need a few scribbles on a few dotted lines. Hi, there.<eos> I'll get you a wheelchair up here.<eos> No, I don't...
I just couldn't do it.<eos> That's not the way I want to start my career, and it's really, really not the way that I want to end up with you.<eos> So, if I got to do... a thousand more Bar Mitzvahs before I'm discovered, then... so be it.<eos> That's great.<eos> So, I screwed up... again?<eos> No.<eos> I did.<eos> For hesitating even one second before I said yes.<eos> You are a grown-up... an adorable grown-up, who I want to grow very old with.<eos> I do, Jonah Miller.

- We got it.<eos> - If you want to do this thing,...<eos> - you're on your own.<eos> - All right.<eos> Understood?<eos> So, you going?<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> The man has 700 sports channels.<eos> You want to see what he's got under his bed?<eos> No, I do not.
We've gone up against rougher dudes than this before.<eos> I know.<eos> But it's this whole treating people as commodities.<eos> This whole barbaric sport.<eos> Hey, don't lump these guys in with Rucker.<eos> All right, he's not what the sport's about.<eos> Eliot, this "sport" is about two guys beating the crap out of each other.<eos> MMA fighters act with more respect than any other athlete I've seen.<eos> - Yeah, they're "braveheart." I get it.<eos> - No, you don't.
On torres.<eos> Only two people know this happened -- me and you.<eos> If I ever hear you tried to cut a deal on me or tried to roll on me, i'm gonna let the streets know you was ratting' franzine out.<eos> Nod your head so I know you heard me. Now run.<eos> We don't give out awards. You can get up now.<eos> You good?<eos> where's the cellphone?<eos> What cellphone?<eos> I<eos> - I don't - - I --
some of these pictures he the same guy in them, but you can't quite make him out.<eos> I wonder who he is.<eos> Where you headed, beautiful?<eos> Carter.<eos> I was in the neighborhood.<eos> No, you weren't. Gossip Girl said you'd returned.<eos> I wanted to see you.<eos> Well, you've seen me.<eos> Now you can go. We need to talk.<eos> No,we don't.
That's how I work.<eos> So, what else?<eos> Murray, this place is amazing.<eos> This is exactly what I've been looking for - a place with people to bounce ideas off of, resources, somewhere to feel like I really exist in this town.<eos> - And your concern is?<eos> - That this is about Vince.<eos> - You're very insecure.<eos> - Not usually.<eos> Look, I want Vince.<eos> Who doesn't?
I've been where you guys are. I get it.<eos> You're just mega-fans who really wanna make a difference.<eos> But you are single-handedly destroying what the Blur stands for.<eos> We know we've made some mistakes.<eos> How do we make up for what we've done?<eos> You just wait for the right moment.<eos> You'll know.<eos> So the Blur trusts you, right?<eos> I mean, how do you always know the right thing to do?<eos> You don't.
That I let you out 20 miles outside of Framingham?<eos> Take care.<eos> I know he thought I was passing him off, but he means the world to me.<eos> He knows that.<eos> What was the place like?<eos> - Nice.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> He'll be as good as he can be.<eos> Don, I don't want to.<eos> I don't.
And there's no reason to doubt that.<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> It's like Polish handball.<eos> You can't even play it if you're left-handed.<eos> There's no wall on that side.<eos> Well, then, that's done with.<eos> We needn't be involved.<eos> Bert, you know that's not the way the marketplace works.<eos> A man comes through your door, he knows what he wants, he's got the money to back it up,<eos> - you do your best.
Burt Peterson lived hard and loved hard.<eos> So, Harry here is an expert in media.<eos> - Television.<eos> The air, not the sets.<eos> - Now, Admiral Television sales are flat.<eos> - We know that.<eos> - But as we studied your indices, we realized that they're not flat everywhere.<eos> In fact, among negroes, sales are actually growing.<eos> - We know that, too.<eos> - You do?
How are you, Ed?<eos> - Is your wife at home?<eos> - Can I come in for a minute?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - What are you drinking, Ed?<eos> - I have a martini waiting next door.<eos> Let me make this quick.<eos> You know we have this German au pair working for us?<eos> - No, I didn't know that.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- I am. Plenty to do.<eos> Well, you have a good night.<eos> I should get back to work.<eos> - Sorry to trouble you.<eos> Good night. - Good night.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - You don't want to know.<eos> - I think I do.<eos> - I can't tell you.<eos> Now I really do.
Well, good morning, babe.<eos> You're so sweet.<eos> So have you seen her script?<eos> You certainly do know how to hit the off switch.<eos> Sorry, babe. I'm working with her today.<eos> Yeah, I'm not so sure that's a good idea.<eos> I don't trust her around men.<eos> She's like one of those herpes from mythology.<eos> You mean harpies?<eos> No, actually, I don't.
- What do you think?<eos> - l don't know.<eos> It might be fun.<eos> Then do it.<eos> - What if I don't like it?<eos> - Then quit.<eos> I mean, that's what I'd do, but don't ask me, I'm stupid.<eos> Just ask Brooke.<eos> - l'm sure she doesn't think that.<eos> - Mm, she does.
It's simple.<eos> Simple.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> If you don't mind, we'd like to speak to Jim Grossman anyway.<eos> I was in the house when it happened.<eos> Didn't even see it.<eos> For argument's sake, say we believe you.<eos> - Why?<eos> The cops didn't.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> You've been together all summer.<eos> I dot get it.<eos> Okay, it's like this.<eos> After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk.<eos> We should figure out what this is.<eos> Yes, we should.<eos> Or.<eos> Okay, now, we have to figure this out.<eos> Yes, we do.
Please. Whatever.<eos> Just show me that stitch again.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Happy thanksgiving.<eos> Who wants wine?<eos> Ooh, i do.
- Let me go!<eos> Get him!<eos> Let me go!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Check his pockets.<eos> - here's his wallet.<eos> Let me go!<eos> - I said I didn't have any.<eos> - Hold him down.<eos> Don't!
Ystad police want to ask some questions.<eos> Of course.<eos> Mike Sterner.<eos> - You set the schedule for shipments.<eos> -Yes, just to the south of Sweden.<eos> Does Ystad count as southern Sweden?<eos> -Should I be honest ...<eos> -We would assume so.<eos> -Such a things should not take place<eos> -They do.
Affects kidneys and lungs.<eos> Start him on immunosuppressors and dialysis.<eos> We'll do it after we run it by House.<eos> He's not answering his pager.<eos> Looks like he's leaving it up to us.<eos> Us, not you.<eos> And since we don't disagree, you can save your fight for another case.<eos> How long do I have to be hooked up for?<eos> Four to six hours a day until we see an improvement.<eos> What if you don't?
She's trying to die.<eos> I'd like to find some family if I can.<eos> - I'll see what I can do.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - All right, I'm going.<eos> Thanks for calling, by the way.<eos> It was great to hear from you... When you called me.<eos> - I only called you because I needed a favor.<eos> - Right.<eos> - How we doing?
- Why did you tell me this?<eos> ! - You asked.<eos> Why not lie?<eos> I'm late for work.<eos> I would've bought anything.<eos> Look, don't freak out.<eos> It's over.<eos> Not for me.<eos> Now I have to tell your mom!<eos> No, you don't.
Are you chatting?<eos> I won't disturb you.<eos> Liam, go to bed.<eos> -Did you have a good time?<eos> -Go and brush your teeth.<eos> -What did you get up to?<eos> -I said teeth.<eos> -But Jojje hasn't brushed his.<eos> -He'll have to brush twice tomorrow.<eos> -You never did your teeth just then. -I did.
- guess he's never seen her regen before.<eos> So some dinner, huh?<eos> - par for the course.<eos> Especially when it comes to my ex-husband.<eos> I don't know what's going on between him and claire.<eos> - well, i don't know either, But i think that thanksgiving dinner was just his way<eos> Of letting claire know that she has a family That loves her.<eos> Nothing wrong with that.<eos> - i thought you gave up all this.<eos> - yeah, so did i.
That kind of hatred is contagious.<eos> We have to make an example of her so that she doesn't infect others.<eos> Hello?<eos> George?<eos> Mr. Sutton?<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> I'm sorry. I... I didn't think anyone was...<eos> I'm looking for George Sutton.<eos> He doesn't live here anymore.<eos> No one does.
- Bates, yes.<eos> - My goodness, why?<eos> Well, I met her niece, Jane Fairfax, in Weymouth.<eos> Yes, I told Frank that though he will have seen Jane amongst equals in Weymouth, here her family are in reduced circumstances and it is important he show respect.<eos> They seem to be getting along very well. So you are acquainted with the Campbells.<eos> Did you see the incident?<eos> (WHISPERS) Did not Mr Dixon save Jane Fairfax's life?<eos> Oh, er, yes, yes, it was the talk of the town.<eos> - She said it was nothing.<eos> - Oh, did she indeed?
That's why you miss Marshall and Lily.<eos> And can't you just admit that?<eos> - That was amazing, Lily!<eos> - I know! When I got that left-hand-yellow, I was like, "What?<eos> !"<eos> - You {\guys }are the best.<eos> - Right back at you!<eos> For charades.<eos> How do we know you two won't hurt us again?<eos> You don't.
I just... those diet pills.<eos> I'll cut back or I'll just stop taking them.<eos> - What's this all about?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> What is that?<eos> - Are you doing drugs?<eos> - Why are you saying that to me?<eos> Because you're in the bathroom with some stranger, you're pacing around like a lunatic, and there's cocaine on your makeup mirror.<eos> It was Makenna.<eos> She does it.
Not gonna do it, no.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Do you know the name of this song?<eos> - Right. "True." - "True", of course.<eos> This is false.<eos> I'm not gonna play "True" for someone who's false.<eos> He doesn't even know the band.<eos> He's not a fan.<eos> Of course he does.
I can rock a killer foot rub with one hand and brew a kick-ass pot of chamomile in the other that would make you weep.<eos> Hell, I've forgotten more about microwaving fat-free popcorn and watching Sandra Bullock movies than you'll ever know, but thanks for your concern, rook.<eos> - Let me ask you one question. - Sure.<eos> Do you mind if there is a sink full of dirty dishes?<eos> Not really.<eos> Then it's Lily's problem, not yours.<eos> But if I said that to her, it would only lead to a fight, so...<eos> You fight.<eos> See, Robin and I never fight.<eos> - Of course you do.
man, this is dicey.<eos> Should we just try to hash it out?<eos> probably, but then again, you know, It feels like we'd be talking about<eos> Something way in the future, you know, like years.<eos> yeah, who knows how we'll feel by then?<eos> Hell, one of us may even be dead.<eos> yeah, and with your cholesterol...<eos> Oh, yeah, it'll be me.<eos> look, i say we act like men And we bury it under a mountain of denial so deep That no one can make us believe that it ever actually happened.<eos> Already done. free and breezy.
- Can I ask you a question?<eos> - Sure. Where do you think this is going?<eos> To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.<eos> You're so funny.<eos> You're like a standup comedian.<eos> A Jewish standup comedian, that would be new.<eos> Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.<eos> No, I was just - Because - Never mind.<eos> Look, Howard, this is our third date, and we both know what that means.<eos> - We do?
Thanks.<eos> It's a nightmare.<eos> All the best, number 1.<eos> You don't have to wear this.<eos> Look how--look how silly it looks on me, yeah?<eos> I hate wearing this so much.<eos> (groans) he said, "you put that on you," and he was yelling.<eos> And I was like, "okay, don't get mad."<eos> But I don't want to wear it.<eos> I don't.
I think that's why he sent for Bizzy, because anywhere Bizzy goes, Susan goes, too.<eos> He invited his wife out so that she would bring his mistress?<eos> That's my father.<eos> And my mother trusts her.<eos> I mean, she lives on the estate.<eos> You know, and now he does this?<eos> Ugh. I mean, right under Bizzy's nose.<eos> And now they're here in my house.<eos> Uh, I need a drink.<eos> - No, no, no, you don't.
Stay alert, everyone.<eos> Spread out and look around, men.<eos> General.<eos> Buzz is dead.<eos> -Any sign of Luminara?<eos> -No, sir.<eos> There was a struggle.<eos> This is not a good sign.<eos> Luminara's lightsaber.<eos> Poggle didn't do this.
I had but one Jedi before young Poggle bring me, but now I have three!<eos> Now, watch as my child enters your Jedi friend.<eos> And once inside, her mind becomes my mind, her thoughts, my thoughts.<eos> It's a sort of mind control, a hive mind.<eos> She thinks she can possess us.<eos> Great.<eos> Find out everything you wanted to know yet?<eos> No, wait, I want to see how it works.<eos> I don't think Luminara wants to see how it works.<eos> No, I don't.
Walt Disney isn't around yet, nor Mickey Mouse.<eos> Watch up, watch up! A love story! As real as life itself!<eos> I'Il tell you something, but don't get the wrong idea. They find that formula.<eos> You know the one that's said to be secret? -What's that?<eos> -Cola of course!<eos> Liquorice, bicarbonate of soda..<eos> And the base is syrup anyway.<eos> Hold it, I'm not with you.<eos> They really invent cola?<eos> Sure they do, but..

Isn't there a proper pan?<eos> Is this a pan for boiling?<eos> This is for coffee. When it is crowded here we have to use it to make coffee.<eos> Resistance, resistance...<eos> How many spoons will you add?<eos> Listen, this needs at least 10 more spoonfuls.<eos> I will put three.<eos> Three?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> In the small pan, we do it with three spoons.
-I'm going down to Hagrid's.<eos> -What?<eos> No, Harry, you've got to go and speak to Slughorn.<eos> -We have a plan.<eos> -I know but I've got a good feeling about Hagrid's.<eos> I feel it's the place to be tonight.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> -No.<eos> -Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.<eos> or Felix does.
Now I'm off to see Suzi X.<eos> What a dickhead!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Okay, I'll make you a deal.<eos> You surrender the head of the Fuhrer, okay, and we promise we will show you mercy.<eos> That's the best I can do.<eos> Oh, I love it when you boys talk all nasty Nazi to me.<eos> I get all crazy inside.<eos> - Now, who wants a little head?<eos> - I do, I do, I do!
Please, we can't do this without you.<eos> They all died because of me.<eos> I started this and now I need to finish it.<eos> They left us nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Why do we have to right their wrongs?<eos> Sometimes, one must be sacrificed.<eos> No!<eos> You did it!<eos> No, I didn't.
Nor does he have one of these marvelous stem-cell compatible pigs.<eos> Live on WWB,<eos> Mr. Nobody will be the last man on Earth to die of old-age.<eos> - Mr. Nobody...<eos> - The Last Mortal.<eos> The last mortal.<eos> Now, Doctor, no trace of his identity has been found on the National Records.<eos> Nothing about his past.<eos> We do not know who Mr. Nobody is.<eos> Neither does he.
We might as well stop for today.<eos> Let's go to the Red Ant, we haven't been in ages.<eos> OK for a drink?<eos> Cool.<eos> Hi!<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I was at the dentist I thought I'd meet you.<eos> You smoke?<eos> I didn't know you smoked.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Anything I can do?<eos> - It's not your war.<eos> Go home. - And forget everything.<eos> - And leave you fighting them alone?<eos> I can take care of myself.<eos> My dad is the general at the base.<eos> I could tell him, and...<eos> - Don't tell anyone!<eos> - Why? You want to live? You want your father to live?<eos> Then don't!
As long as the insurance company buys it, I'm fine.<eos> It'll be fine. Trust me. It's all good.<eos> This is why the Dalai Lama says to practice detachment.<eos> So your not bound by the shackles of material possessions.<eos> It means we need to learn to let go.<eos> Yes<eos> Hey Honey? I think the universe trying to tell me something.<eos> Hey Sherlock, the wood needs be drier than that.<eos> Sherlock?<eos> We did that at school.
- How are you not dead?<eos> - How should I know? Stop turning me.<eos> Okay! God.<eos> Pete, I want you to know this is all your fault.<eos> If it wasn't for you, I would still have a body. Okay.<eos> If you weren't such a stick in the butt and had come with us, you'd still have a body.<eos> Besides, we actually had a really good time.<eos> Speaking of which, your sister and I want to tell you something.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> - Yes, we do.
It's what Cylons do.<eos> It's a legacy from you.<eos> Fine.<eos> So it's a vote?<eos> All right.<eos> I vote we go.<eos> Great.<eos> That's me and you.<eos> I mean, we don't really know what Anders would vote.<eos> Yeah, we do.
If I leave you this girl, that means the destruction of my people.<eos> How does our extinction fit into this picture that you want us to believe in?<eos> We'll give you resurrection.<eos> Saul!<eos> You give us Hera and we will give you resurrection.<eos> But the war ends here.<eos> You leave humanity in peace... and give up the pursuit now and for all time.<eos> Agreed.<eos> How do we know we can take your word for it?<eos> You don't.
This is my brother, Hartwig.<eos> Thank you for having the patience for my little sister.<eos> As a child she climbed trees instead of praying.<eos> I believe one can pray even up a tree.<eos> Our saints managed it on columns.<eos> Just as the earth lets grow things of use and of no use, the feet of man carry them to deeds of use and of no use.<eos> When man does good deeds, the elements have their proper path.<eos> But when he does bad deeds, he turns the elements against himself in punishment.<eos> Do you believe that the elements can turn against us to punish us?<eos> Yes, my child, I do.
Take, uh, 20 minutes.<eos> I'm very handy.<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Suit yourself. Excuse me.<eos> I have to get something from oven.<eos> Probably a puppy.<eos> You're just mad because their stories match up perfectly.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> - You don't suppose...<eos> - Oh, but I do.
-You never know.<eos> Lot of Lohan.<eos> Just stay there, okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> Can you drop me off?<eos> Was that Riley?<eos> That's none of your business.<eos> Your mother told me to keep an eye on you.<eos> That doesn't mean you have to go everywhere I do.<eos> Yes, it does.
And these are sightings of Abraham.<eos> This one's the most recent.<eos> Then that's where we'll start.<eos> This room is so adorable. How could you not like it?<eos> Because I'm not 8.<eos> It's my mom's subconscious way of trying to keep me a kid.<eos> The minute she took off, out came the paintbrush.<eos> Where'd she go?<eos> -You don't wanna know.<eos> -Yeah, I do actually.
No.<eos> -Hey, do you know a girl named Jody?<eos> -Sorry, no, no.<eos> Do you know a Jody? Do you know Jody?<eos> WOMAN 1:<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Hey, do you know a girl named Jody? Do you know someone named Jody?<eos> WOMAN 2:<eos> No.<eos> WOMAN 3: We don't.
Happy.<eos> Funny.<eos> Get the lights, please.<eos> It's an unanticipated response in the symbolistic software.<eos> The Al keeps giving us random, unsolicited images.<eos> We don't know what they mean or why it continues to respond this way.<eos> What we do know is that when we run performance tests on the Al its computational time is increasing. The optimality of its outputs is decreasing.<eos> It's taking more time to do less.<eos> Yeah. I mean, you could say that, yes.<eos> I just did.
You're not gonna...<eos> feel alone, feel guilty.<eos> Feel guilty about not feeling guilty.<eos> That's what happens to other people, you'll be fine.<eos> You know where to find me.<eos> Not that you'll need to.<eos> Ed,it's time.<eos> Code of silence been lifted?<eos> - Yeah. - So how'd it go?<eos> - The way they do.
That's some kind of code for you,isn't it?<eos> Maybe I should take him.<eos> No,I'll take him.<eos> What's this?<eos> Look,it's been... very interesting working here,but... I'm a man of science, and this place is just...<eos> It's very dramatic.<eos> Well said.<eos> I just want to work in a regular lab,you know?<eos> So,you want that ride or not?<eos> Yes,he does.
So what does that mean?<eos> He has the right to get treatment without getting roughed-up by doctors.<eos> What if he goes to Anspaugh? . Or the board?<eos> What then? .<eos> You don't know what you' re dealing with.<eos> -What are you talking about?<eos> . -That guy's guilty.<eos> -Hey, we don't know that.<eos> -I know what he is.<eos> What? . What do you--?
Oh, come on, please.<eos> At least you know who you're competing against...<eos> The drummer.<eos> But...<eos> Who do you think alice is attracted to?<eos> Who do you think she's fantasizing about?<eos> Who is she having sex with?<eos> - You don't wanna know that.<eos> - Oh, yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
Good enough to avenge Dave Martin's death.<eos> Three months ago, the company finally got a permit to exploit the aquifer.<eos> All that money.<eos> I put things together.<eos> Realized what they'd done to Dave.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I confess, I never really did get to the end of it.<eos> - Ahab does die, doesn't he?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But so does the whale.
The handsome one.<eos> Gay, yes?<eos> This is a murder investigation.<eos> You've got no alibi for the time frame in question.<eos> We're looking at you as a suspect.<eos> You should take this a little more seriously.<eos> When I was this big? I was in a detention camp for two years.<eos> - You understand? - I underst...<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
And now I'm gonna make him evil.<eos> Question 98:<eos> You are stranded on an island with a stranger.<eos> You find a food supply, but there is only enough to keep one person alive.<eos> If you do not share the food, your survival is guaranteed but the stranger will starve.<eos> Do you, A, share the food or, B, keep the food for yourself?<eos> - B.<eos> - See?<eos> It works.<eos> It does work.
But it's gonna have to happen one at a time,<eos> And later or not at all.<eos> Or not at all!<eos> Now leave us alone.<eos> Go.<eos> Sometimes it helps to pretend it's real.<eos> How did you get them to listen to you?<eos> I just told them that i would do the same for them later.<eos> Yeah, great, but how do you keep them from coming back?<eos> You don't.
I'm good.<eos> Look, about what I was saying earlier...<eos> doesn't mean I don't want this.<eos> I know.<eos> I'd rather be dead than be that guy.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> We should get going.<eos> I can hear my mom swearing from here.<eos> - Do you know where Kyle is?<eos> - No, I don't.
- I do.<eos> Been a while since you suited up, brother.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I can do this.<eos> Get Cameron to confirm the payoff.<eos> No mistakes.<eos> Allright.<eos> I want Ope pulling the trigger on this.<eos> I want to make sure he's really back.<eos> We all do.
Okay.<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> It means something's wrong.<eos> It means he could be dying, And he doesn't know you give a crap.<eos> Honestly, he doesn't know, and maybe you don't, But if you do, he's dying, and you're gonna be too late.<eos> Alex, stop.<eos> He's asking for you, and you're gonna be too late,<eos> And you're gonna live with it for the rest of your life!<eos> You really want to live with that, huh?<eos> Do you? Alex!
- He's my son.<eos> - Wha...<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> You didn't catch the family resemblance?<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> You know, I think he's quite smitten with you.<eos> Really?<eos> Uh, I'm not so sure.<eos> Well, he told me that he took you to the Cloisters.<eos> He definitely doesn't do that with just anyone.
Of course.<eos> And, vanessa, listen. uh...<eos> Take care of yourself. All right?<eos> My new boyfriend aaron Is on his way here to meet everyone, And I want your word on something.<eos> If you're talking about the dress, I say "higher."<eos> Chuck, I want you word that you will not mention anything<eos> About the girl I used to be. I just got aaron to myself, And if the one thing I have to do to keep it that way<eos> Then that's what I'm gonna do.<eos> I get it. you lied to him.<eos> N--no, I didn't.
- Then invite strangers.<eos> I have to present myself as a crown jewel surrounded by other, smaller, slightly flawed gems but quality stones nonetheless.<eos> And try to round up some people who can vote so it doesn't feel like a total high-school party.<eos> A party at the Hudson, huh?<eos> I got your message.<eos> Since when are you having a party?<eos> Since it became clear that Marcus does not think I'm worthy of meeting his family.<eos> Obviously, I have some more work to do.<eos> - B, you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Jenny?<eos> - I know.<eos> - I'll clean the atelier soon.<eos> - The bathrooms too.<eos> Someone decided to give us a second look at breakfast.<eos> Laurel believes in her interns paying their dues.<eos> MODEL:<eos> You must really want this.<eos> Why? Because for three months I've put up with midnight coffee runs 15-hour days, cleaning up after the two in-house bulimics all so that Eleanor Waldorf will spend five minutes looking at my designs?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I really, really do.
So don't.<eos> Go to your boss and tell her what happened.<eos> If Laurel's half as smart as you say she is, she knows she's lucky to have you. But she doesn't know.<eos> What?<eos> She doesn't know anything about me that's the problem.<eos> Charlie, you're a genius.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Delilah's father called.<eos> Apparently she had a wonderful time with you this afternoon.<eos> Well done.
It's not cancer.<eos> This was your diagnosis.<eos> I never thought it was cancer.<eos> You treated for cancer.<eos> I thought that what she had acted like cancer.<eos> If it acts like cancer, maybe it'll respond like cancer.<eos> It did.<eos> 'Cause it's cancer.<eos> We have to find something that walks like cancer, Talks like cancer, Tastes like cancer, but isn't cancer.<eos> No, we don't.
You have no reason to trust me.<eos> You have to do your treatment.<eos> The other possibility is you have vasculitis.<eos> The treatment for that is steroids.<eos> If you've been using drugs, if they've damaged your heart, and I start you on steroids, they could kill you.<eos> I haven't used drugs.<eos> I'll get the steroids.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I owe clinic hours.<eos> No, you don't.
We said "everything".<eos> No need to push the revs.<eos> It's got power.<eos> Two fingers on the wheel, Ok?<eos> Ok, honey, you can go.<eos> Come on, back up.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> You're standing behind the car, Hugo.<eos> Sorry, my mistake.<eos> Easy does it.
She is making 1000 to 2000 Dollars a day... kicking up her heels and having sex with her friends.<eos> Sounds great, right?<eos> Well now it's time to leave the industy.<eos> Say she doesn't, or hasn't had the opportunity to save any money.<eos> She does_t have any education, cause she started when she was 1$.<eos> Where is she gonna go?<eos> I'm in this business for 16 years now.<eos> Bad things happen all the time.<eos> Half the time the people I book will not show up and we have a problem to replace people.<eos> We constantly do.
Well, don't.<eos> It's not over yet.<eos> - He wants us to wait.<eos> - Wait?<eos> Wait for what?<eos> I just got humiliated.<eos> You're gonna come beg for my job back?<eos> I don't beg.<eos> I don't need this that bad.<eos> Yes you do, Vince.
Yeah, we told you that last week.<eos> Right, listen, and it is perfect timing for us.<eos> - how is it perfect timing?<eos> - because we have general meetings all week, right?<eos> And there's nothing greater in life than having something Specific to say at a general.<eos> And what specifically do we have to say?<eos> That we want to do "smokejumpers."<eos> - but ed norton already wants to do it.<eos> - does he?<eos> Yeah, he does.
Not quite.<eos> I've read scripts.<eos> - A lot of scripts.<eos> - You boys are maturing so nicely.<eos> - Lloyd.<eos> - Thank you, Lloyd.<eos> So, Vinnie, I need to formally apologize face to face for this Danger Beach thing.<eos> - Ari, don't.<eos> - I thought it was real.<eos> - We both did.
This is most extraordinary. But I beg you, Miss Spencer, to entertain my explanation of it, for it will be truthful, if a little intractable to believe.<eos> There is a door, Miss Spencer, in the attic portion of my father's house, which is a place unvisited except by servants and myself.<eos> Were this door to open, it would give upon the empty air four storeys high, for there is no room beyond.<eos> It is a door entirely without sense.<eos> One may not pass through it, try as one might, until this day, for you, Miss Spencer, have opened this door for me.<eos> You are the key.<eos> What makes you think my name is Spencer?<eos> It is tailored in your underthings.<eos> My name is Price, Amanda Price.<eos> How do you do, Miss Price?
Hello.<eos> Is it love?<eos> Is it love? Is it?<eos> Is it? No, he's just my friend.<eos> We've just lost everything on the fucking screens.<eos> We've lost everything on the screens!<eos> Watch me vodka.<eos> Don't! Fuck off!<eos> It's annoying!<eos> Don't!
- Hey you, It's Peter.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> We were supposed to do something today.<eos> - Ah, I forgot to tell you.<eos> I have a doctor's appointment today.<eos> I'm actually there now.<eos> Hey look, Lindsay Lohan just took her top off.<eos> Hey, I just drank a beer.<eos> Who wants to do me?<eos> - I do!
But she didn't!<eos> And how are you going to prove that?<eos> Please listen to me.<eos> I have done nothing. Please.<eos> I swear I haven't done anything.<eos> Well done.<eos> Why will no-one believe me?<eos> He got better.<eos> He just recovered.<eos> I didn't do anything.
Good night, Arthur.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Lady Morgana, isn't it?<eos> I'm Sophia.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - My father and I are guests of the King.<eos> You're lying.<eos> I know what you're going to do to him, and I won't let it happen.<eos> Does Arthur know you feel this way about him?<eos> Of course he does.
I knew something was wrong.<eos> In the end, Phil Emerson decided to drive him down to the hospital and I stayed behind here with the other kids.<eos> But he was still alive when they left?<eos> He was very sick, Mrs Grant.<eos> And no-one else has recovered.<eos> - But I did!<eos> - You're the only one.<eos> But you don't know.<eos> You don't know for certain that he's dead.<eos> No, I don't.
What's going on here?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Enjoying an evening out with my woman.<eos> What?<eos> Jen, who is this joker?<eos> No offence.<eos> OK, what the hell is going on here?<eos> Moss is my husband, Roy.<eos> But you said you wanted me.<eos> She really did.
What do you mean?<eos> - I'm back. From holiday.<eos> - You were on holiday?<eos> - Yes, I was on holiday.<eos> - Oh, that's right...<eos> - Yes, yes, yes...<eos> You didn't know I was on holiday? No, no, no, we did.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> You didn't know I was on holiday!<eos> Oh, we did, we did...
Really?<eos> No, no.<eos> No, I thank you, Mr Chivery, you're very kind.<eos> Thank you, Mr Chivery.<eos> Oi, mister!<eos> I'm going to go and see Little Mother.<eos> D'you want to come?<eos> I'm on my way home, Maggy.<eos> Oh, you don't you want to see her?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
I spent a while working as an art director on films and TV soaps...<eos> But the way the market operates isn't exactly up my street...<eos> How should I put it?<eos> It's kind of like the system's based a bit on exploitation...<eos> Plus a load of people don't value what you do in the first place.<eos> I haven't severed all my connections though...<eos> I hire out costumes for films or make them...<eos> But at the end of the day, I'm captain of my own ship.<eos> I like films.<eos> Everyone does...
Only once he's born!<eos> Do I look too Parisian?<eos> You'll always be too eccentric for them.<eos> I forgot to buy them a gift.<eos> - We'll find one there.<eos> - When is the train?<eos> Does it matter to you?<eos> 2:45 p.m.<eos> - We missed it!<eos> - Yes, we did!
What did He say?<eos> I couldn't hear Him.<eos> Don't, don't do that, love.<eos> I couldn't hear Him over the other voices.<eos> You're tired. You need to rest.<eos> I can't rest!<eos> Lie down here.<eos> You'll sleep next to me. You always do.<eos> They want to hurt the baby.<eos> Who does?
Something about the man I am inside.<eos> No, I never said that.<eos> Guinevere!<eos> I have to get these washed, Sire.<eos> Gaius!<eos> I'm alive!<eos> What's happened?<eos> Merlin, stay there.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> No, don't.
Hopefully, he'll taste a little better.<eos> I trust you.<eos> - Yes, I'm sure.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> Stanley:<eos> Who the fuck are you supposed to be?<eos> I'm going to snap your neck like a twig.<eos> My cactus.<eos> Whatever that was cannot exist.<eos> But those things outside do.
No it's...<eos> I only had 2500, and I had to buy a ticket so I came here to get it refunded from you guys.<eos> OK, do you know how many squares are wailing at us to get a free pass?<eos> Wait oldie, are you a square?<eos> No... I just wanted to have a cold one...<eos> This isn't the band "Family Help", is it guys?<eos> Does it say "Salvation Army" on my back?<eos> No... -Well look again.<eos> You can read, can't you?<eos> No it does not.
You broke him, he's becoming like his mother!<eos> I see.<eos> -He's always had a fragile heart.<eos> Me and his mom have tried to look after him.<eos> This is a mix-up...<eos> -This is no mix-up Georg!<eos> Stay away from my son and leave my family alone!<eos> Do you hear me? !<eos> ?<eos> -Yes, I do.
Yes, do you have the money?<eos> -No.<eos> He doesn't have the money.<eos> -Pat him and make him pay!<eos> Dad, I just need some time to sell these units, then you get your money.<eos> Nobody's gonna buy this damn junk.<eos> Sure!<eos> I did, and it's ingenious!<eos> I've been everywhere and nobody wants to buy it!<eos> Sure they do!
You're the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met.<eos> You're gonna do great.<eos> Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...<eos> - Okay, okay. - I really need your help here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, there's pus!<eos> It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device,<eos> - not from my body.<eos> - It smells!<eos> Yeah, it does.
Even though it took a while.<eos> It felt like treason against him.<eos> I could only hurting you, and so I'm really not.<eos> I hope I can let you ever see.<eos> I had to do something.<eos> I had the first past behind me.<eos> Since I had time for that.<eos> I hope I feel better after one year. And that I am sitting next to you while you read this.<eos> But if I'm not there, is not because I do not love you.<eos> Because that I did.
Smoker's privilege.<eos> C'mon you can quit after you had this one.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> Alright.<eos> Jack?<eos> Smoking kills.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You do.
You're one of the greatest adventurers who ever lived!<eos> You're Alex Rover!<eos> But I'm not that Alex Rover.<eos> Yeah, you're definitely not.<eos> 911. What is your emergency?<eos> Uh, me?<eos> That's really, really not important.<eos> What's important is that there's a little girl... and she's all alone somewhere deep in the middle of the South Pacific... and, well, she-she-she's badly injured herself... and I feel<eos> Excuse me. Did you say "South Pacific"?<eos> Yes, yes, I did.
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon<eos> Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.<eos> Don't get him mad.<eos> What's he gonna do about it?<eos> I've got him completely immobilized.<eos> Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I've seen enough.<eos> I'll tell Shifu he has nothing to worry about.<eos> No, he doesn't.
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> It's OK.<eos> I didn't get it the first time, either.<eos> What?<eos> There is no secret ingredient.<eos> It's just you.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I'm gonna pee.<eos> Don't.

But tomorrow... she might.<eos> What job were you and Wayne working on?<eos> Well we've been on different ones. Anyway.<eos> What I started to tell you, I don't see what difference it makes who mails the check, you... or us.<eos> But... the boss says we have to do it. Now I told him you're a nice lady to offer...<eos> I told you I don't have their address.<eos> She never gave it to me.<eos> The only thing I have is their phone number, you want that?<eos> Oh... well, you didn't mention that, did you?<eos> Not on the phone I didn't.
Look, I just don't want you to think that...<eos> That Ray you know, drinks like that, because...<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - This was just kind of a celebratory night.<eos> - No, I understand.<eos> - Yeah, I know that.<eos> - Okay.<eos> The damn babysitter never cleans up after herself.<eos> You have a bruise on your hand.<eos> Yeah, I don't...
Your chances are good.<eos> I'm offering you your freedom, Mr. Ames.<eos> If it's not worth risking your life for, what is?<eos> All right, turn her up and tighten the lines!<eos> She's hemorrhaging!<eos> Ma'am.<eos> You don't have to call me "ma'am." You know that.<eos> This is Mr. Ames.<eos> You know why he's here.<eos> Oh, I do now.
Don't think, okay? Know.<eos> Yo, man.<eos> I'm on the phone.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I think so.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yo, was that Van Sant?<eos> You know what?<eos> I ain't answering, any questions until this motherfucker apologizes for making my phone into soup.<eos> You know how long it took me to put those numbers in that phone? Huh?<eos> Do you?
You're still my wife.<eos> Stop right there, sir!<eos> Now, sir! Get your hands on the hood!<eos> Do it now, sir!<eos> Get down!<eos> Put your hands on the hood!<eos> I've got the cuffs, Jerry.<eos> I got 'em. What?<eos> You don't want mine? Don't need two cuffs, Jerry!<eos> Yes, we do.
And you know what?<eos> I believe in Harvey Dent.<eos> I believe that on his watch, Gotham can feel... a little safer, a little more optimistic.<eos> Look at this face.<eos> This is the face of Gotham's bright future.<eos> To Harvey Dent.<eos> Let's hear it for him.<eos> Harvey.<eos> Harvey may not know you well enough to understand you're making fun of him...<eos> - But I do.
Let me just glean just a little. Maybe there's some good news here.<eos> Let me see.<eos> We have here, folks, a graduate of Heidelberg Universitaet. Oh, though, obviously no- no star pupil.<eos> This is Zyklot 17, the animal tranquilizer.<eos> Yeah, for the permanent relief of pain.<eos> Tell her to leave me alone.<eos> I do not have the strength.<eos> Do you hear what I'm asking you?<eos> I would if I wanted to.<eos> But I don't.
You don't understand.<eos> The woman was crazy.<eos> Let's just take a deep breath here.<eos> Let's just take a moment. Wait.<eos> - I said wait, goddamn it!<eos> - Wait for what?<eos> What can you say that will change anything?<eos> I gotta go. I need...<eos> I need time to think.<eos> No, I don't.
What is that?<eos> Coming over the hill?<eos> It's a beast of some kind!<eos> Dustfinger.<eos> He doesn't like to be tickled.<eos> And you should be more careful.<eos> His name's Gwin.<eos> And I know he looks charming but you know what they say about books and covers.<eos> Uh...<eos> Yeah, I do.
When I found out that she was seriously dating Juan Antonio, I couldn't believe it.<eos> I... Just what we need... a Rorschach blot.<eos> You know, I don't think I like it.<eos> - We'll buy you one of Alejandro's.<eos> Maria Elena...<eos> She tried to kill herself.<eos> What?<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't...
You know, I knew you were crazy.<eos> I didn't know you were stupid, too.<eos> Well, let's just say I was able to get hands on it.<eos> It's my understanding that Scylla could only be used if it's plugged into a decoder box that's hidden in one of the Company facilities.<eos> You know, I wish I could help, but I can't.<eos> No, you are helping, Jasper.<eos> Just a matter of whether you do it before or after I shame you in front of your co-workers here.<eos> Tell me where the Company keeps the box, Jasper.<eos> Could be anywhere, I don't know.<eos> Somebody does.
Help me understand, bruno.<eos> Why is he looking at the guy with the dog?<eos> Um, i'm glad you noticed that.<eos> That was subtle, but i like what we did there.<eos> The guy with the dog Is the life he'll never have.<eos> See, in my subtext, billy's gay.<eos> What?<eos> It gives the piece an interesting layer.<eos> Don't you think? I mean, who needs another frothy, romantic comedy, right?<eos> Actually, bruno... I do.
Look at that girl.<eos> She's gorgeous!<eos> Ray, we're going right now.<eos> Fuck off, are we!<eos> This is the best bit of Bruges so far.<eos> You and your buildings.<eos> Hello.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, you do.

I stood on a cliff, all those below me women, with their arms open.<eos> Joe, come.<eos> Do not worry, Joe.<eos> Joe, come. Spring.<eos> I could not.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> I have not the dream for years.<eos> Writing for Markie brought everything back.<eos> Now my dream again.<eos> You do it along.

I know.<eos> I called you brother, and you try me something to rags.<eos> Nobody does.
It'll help your mind.<eos> Be creative.<eos> - Think about you.<eos> - I think I need to fuck somebody. Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> You're not my stepbrother anymore.<eos> You're a step-stranger.<eos> - Why you talking like that?<eos> - Brian!<eos> You don't need to put your P in a V right now.<eos> No, I don't.
PETER: I think we're gonna go on a hike.<eos> It is sea turtle fucking season, dude.<eos> Let's go.<eos> They fuck for three hours, dude. I mean, that's magical.<eos> - No, we're going on a hike.<eos> - I think we'll go on a hike, yeah.<eos> What?<eos> Your loss.<eos> Why won't anybody go snorkeling with me?<eos> How you doing back there?
He'll have his chance to speak.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Go ahead, son.<eos> Then Mr. Bragg shot Marshal Bell and his other deputy.<eos> You saw this happen with your own eyes, son?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Whitfield.<eos> Mr. Mueller, you may cross-examine the witness.<eos> You swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Look, I... I saw these guys.<eos> I thought that they looked suspicious, so I followed them.<eos> But you did continue to photograph her?<eos> Well, yeah, yeah, but...<eos> I guess so, but... Why?<eos> When you come up with an answer, call me.<eos> What?<eos> It's nothing. I didn't imagine you to be... - ...the person that would say, "whoa."<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I don't.
Abby, this is Mio, Jin, Asami.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> Wanna get a drink?<eos> Hell yeah.<eos> Bye, bye.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Hi, I'm Abby!<eos> - Hi, it's Charlie.<eos> So you guys know Ethan?<eos> Who doesn't, sugar?
He was in Singapore when Ken was murdered.<eos> So what ?<eos> He may have ordered his men to do it.<eos> I've thought things over.<eos> Except you and I, who knew about your pregnancy ?<eos> You must rest.<eos> You need sleep.<eos> Please...<eos> You don't believe me ? - I do<eos> - No, you don't.
You won't find oil there.<eos> Everyone has tried.<eos> Maybe, maybe not.<eos> But we own whatever we find.<eos> Om you know Ernesto Monies'?<eos> A very powerful man in his day.<eos> He had a beautiful Russian wife.<eos> A dancer.<eos> Well, his daughter works for me.<eos> Or did.
I am trying to get to the bottom of something!<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Which is when the man removes his penis from his pajamas and thrusts it into a woman's vagina...<eos> Okay, but Mrs. Gallagher didn't actually say "thrust."<eos> - Yeah. - Oh.<eos> But what I don't understand, Sammy Boigon's sister said he was an accident.<eos> I mean, how do you accidentally thrust a penis into...<eos> Hi, Luis.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - How do you accidentally...
Congratulations.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Who's the lucky guy?<eos> - Sam Knowles.<eos> - Okay.<eos> But he's basically out of the picture.<eos> - He didn't make the cut, huh? - Yeah.<eos> Well, I don't need a guy.<eos> I never really did.
What does that mean?<eos> Well, it means...<eos> "for me." I need to spend time at home.<eos> You okay, there, "Marie-Antoinette"?<eos> Just great.<eos> I'm buying tons of evening gowns to waltz around the Hall of Mirrors.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Hearing you say "time for myself..."<eos> I need time for myself too.<eos> We all do.
I know. It's moronic.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I'm an old fart.<eos> Trying to see her seemed out of place.<eos> What did you write?<eos> I wrote, uh...<eos> "U R awesome.<eos> I'm 2 hot 4 U."<eos> Oh, no. You didn't?
Get me outta this fucking hellhole!<eos> You can all go straight to hell!<eos> You're gonna all go straight to hell!<eos> Howdy.<eos> You don't look so good.<eos> I said you don't look so good, honey.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> No, you don't.<eos> But I know you.<eos> Everybody around here does.
What on earth are you doing?<eos> Come on. You can't sleep anyway.<eos> Cut it out!<eos> Dancing in the middle of the night?<eos> Other people are asleep.<eos> What's with you?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Have you had enough? Didn't you sleep well?<eos> I didn't but you did.
And that one, too.<eos> You can only see it from my room.<eos> And there are some children there?<eos> - Yes, quite a few.<eos> - That's good.<eos> - So, I'll be able to play with them.<eos> - I don't see why not.<eos> I'll wait a little bit, just to see what they're like,<eos> - because they look a bit strange.<eos> - The children do?
We should go.<eos> No messages.<eos> Not one message.<eos> I left for a day. He probably tried you at home.<eos> You heard me crying? Last night?<eos> I wonder how many times a day I cry.<eos> I should count one day.<eos> I bet I'd be amazed.<eos> Do you cry?<eos> No. I don't anymore.
It's because of him that I went to art school.<eos> - So you're an artist.<eos> - I used to be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He died a few months ago.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's just been my year, you know.<eos> Dad died and my husband and my daughter decided she hated me.<eos> I don't know why I thought things were gonna get easier.<eos> Yeah, we all did.
- Oui.<eos> - Do you yourself have children, madame?<eos> - I've never married, Monsieur Poirot.<eos> Oh, je suis dèsolè... mademoiselle.<eos> You say that she kept her room as a shrine to her mother, but you also say that she was extremely attached to her father.<eos> - So there was no shrine to him?<eos> - In her heart, yes.<eos> She never gave up hope that he would return.<eos> Or that a letter would arrive asking her to go out and join him.<eos> It never did.
How can you do this?<eos> One second, Inspector.<eos> There has recently come to my attention some information that is new.<eos> There is one other person here who has the claim to the fortune of Mademoiselle Norma Restarick.<eos> The photograph that I discovered in the apartment of Nanny Seagram was taken by the former tutor of Mademoiselle Norma Restarick - a Mademoiselle A J Battersby.<eos> I paid a visit to her school where she is now the principal.<eos> And I found there a woman full of emotion about a child who had been abandoned, and a man who had deserted them both.<eos> She never gave up hope that he would return.<eos> Or that a letter would arrive asking her to go out and join him.<eos> It never did.
We're alone here, aren't we?<eos> The others aren't coming back soon.<eos> And the door's locked.<eos> All right, good.<eos> Can you feel God's presence?<eos> You know what?<eos> I think I do.<eos> So do I.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you, too?
Move, come on!<eos> Over by the couch.<eos> Now!<eos> I wanna hate you so much.<eos> So much.<eos> You had a vision, remember?<eos> The arrow, the temple.<eos> I went down to that planet with you, and it was a frakking' toaster party.<eos> A lot of good people died, remember?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- So we've got to get out of here.<eos> - What tape?<eos> The tape in the tent?<eos> - Yes, this tape.<eos> - Jenny, get away from her!<eos> - Oh my God!<eos> - Kevin, do you know about that?<eos> - No, no, wait, Niki.<eos> - Get away from her.<eos> - Kevin, do you...? - Yes, I do.
Oh, fucking shit! Again?<eos> !<eos> Can you please, please come over?<eos> Please...<eos> Oh my God!<eos> This is the most beautiful letter than anyone has ever written to me and it completely reminded me of why I want to be in this movie and how I am so into you and I just love you so.<eos> Oh my God! Oh my God! Fuck!<eos> I didn't, I didn't...<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> I didn't...
You should bring naomi home.<eos> take your shirt off.<eos> is she dead?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why didn't she kill you?<eos> she was trying to get information from me.<eos> What sort of information?<eos> She wanted to know who I worked for.<eos> She wanted to know about you.<eos> Of course she did.

Joking about how I'm not the man that I used to be?<eos> Let me share something with you, Simon.<eos> You're not the man you used to be, either. You are far fucking from it.<eos> Dry your dick off and get the fuck outta my room.<eos> Lady, do you...<eos> Look, I'm just trying to change my...<eos> Yes, I made it up.<eos> - Shit, Simon.<eos> - We weren't wrong, you know?

But this is Miss Pretty Little Thang's little face.<eos> And, Norbit, if you ever see her again, if you ever talk to her again, if you ever so much as think about the bitch again, this is what's gonna happen to her.<eos> How you doing?<eos> You get the picture, Norbit?<eos> Deion, I just think that we need to take a beat.<eos> It's not you, it's me.<eos> Just if we slow down, I...<eos> Oh, good, you're up.<eos> - Deion, we need to talk.<eos> - Yes, we do.

Then that's right.<eos> If you want to forgive, forgive.<eos> Then that's right.<eos> Just make a decision.<eos> What decision, Mark?<eos> I don't want to lose my kids like you.<eos> I can't believe it's happening to me.<eos> I didn't lose my kids.<eos> I just got myself used to the idea that they don't exist.<eos> But they do.
He said that this was to be for you, Ginger.<eos> Listen, I know you've both been through hell but shouldn't you just leave him alone?<eos> We just wanna be part of his life.<eos> No, I know.

You can take all the novels in the world and not one of them will make you feel as good as fast as:<eos> That is real poetry. Those are real poets.<eos> Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, the Beatles.<eos> Okay. What if one of your heroes came up to you and said--<eos> You know, Smokey, what if he said:<eos> "Alex Fletcher, you are a horrible songwriter"? How would you react?<eos> I know Smokey a little bit. He's too nice a gentleman ever to say such a thing.<eos> Dylan might.<eos> Dylan would, actually.<eos> In fact, Dylan did.
Please.<eos> - I'll see you there.<eos> You won't.<eos> You won't because you're not invited.<eos> They won't let you in.<eos> - Hey, Ray.<eos> - Alex, my man.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm good, man.<eos> How you doing?
Why?<eos> What did he do?<eos> Well, Bensley told him what was going on and he never reported it to the authorities, so he was convicted of obstructing justice and conspiracy to commit fraud.<eos> Pretty rough, huh?<eos> When I used to climb the rope in gym class, I wished it was a guy.<eos> Well, there is a secret weapon that really might help get these guys off your back.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Well, we love secrets.<eos> Yeah, we do them all the time.
You know?<eos> It's not like a rectangle.<eos> 'Cause that has a bunch of, you know, places that stop. This one is a big circle of...<eos> Okay, you know, wrap up the circle thing. Come on.<eos> Moving on.<eos> I'm gonna move quicker now.<eos> Do you, Kevin "Butterfly" McDonough, take Fred G. Duncan to be your lawful wedded partner?<eos> I dizoo.<eos> And do you, Fred G. Duncan, take this guy over here to be your lawfully wedded partner?<eos> I do.
Feel it in your stomach.<eos> Feel it in your chest.<eos> Very, very good.<eos> Now let it go.<eos> Your rage and contempt vanish.<eos> You can relax again.<eos> Everything is soft and peaceful.<eos> - Your body is heavy...<eos> - Enough! I'll have him buried<eos> - in cement... - Don't!
Up north.<eos> Excellent pay and all my favourite subjects.<eos> - Are you going to commute?<eos> - No, it's much too far away.<eos> You will have to visit me.<eos> We will walk on the beaches...<eos> We will be lovers in a totally new way.<eos> - Couldn't you find something closer?<eos> - But I want this.<eos> I don't.
They thought the villagers would be unnecessarily provoked.<eos> What do you say, Cee?<eos> Does the hot weather make you behave badly?<eos> -Good heavens, you're blushing.<eos> -It's just hot in here, that's all.<eos> Lola, wipe that lipstick off.<eos> You're far too young.<eos> What about you, Briony?<eos> What sins have you committed today?<eos> -I've done nothing wrong.
How's your momma?<eos> Okay.<eos> She still in the hospital?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who's taking care of you?<eos> I am.<eos> You don't have a girlfriend?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - You don't know?<eos> - No... I don't.
Okay.<eos> That's it.<eos> Are you asleep?<eos> You okay?<eos> I can only come here for a little while.<eos> Did you ever hear or see Sylvia talk back to any of those people when these things were being done to her?<eos> No I never.<eos> When it first started did she say anything then?<eos> No except she would say, I'm sorry or something like that. As if she did something wrong, but she never did anything wrong.<eos> Did you yourself on any of these occasions do anything to Sylvia?
I saw us in your father's living room, trying to make conversation.<eos> Then you'd yawn, stand up and say: "So, I'll leave you two together now."<eos> Shit, then it starts.<eos> It always starts in:<eos> "Do you enjoy your work?"<eos> Or, "What do you earn, is there a future in it?"<eos> Where and how do you want to live? A house with garage and a green Jaguar and kids, in the suburbs.<eos> Try to understand, that's just what I don't want.<eos> That doesn't interest me.<eos> What does then?
Here.<eos> Keep pressure on the wound, or he'll bleed to death.<eos> - Where?<eos> Where?<eos> You saw it, right?<eos> He had a fucking knife in his chest.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Honey?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't...
Do you need to pee?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let's go then.<eos> Fire away!<eos> Wow, that's quite a stream!<eos> I envy you.<eos> Don't you have a stream like that?<eos> - Used to. But not any more.<eos> Did you forget how to do it?<eos> - Yes, I did.
No, A little further back.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, that's ok now.<eos> - Ok, cool.<eos> Ok.<eos> Wait a moment, it moved, Move it another 10 degrees west.<eos> So these are the live ratings.<eos> With 500 boxes we can manipulate<eos> Only the one channel, so far. No more.<eos> Do it then!
He sacrificed himself for this to work.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Prove it!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> If I was Merlin, you would know.<eos> What about Adria?<eos> Still on the ship.<eos> Alright, here's a question.<eos> How do we know it worked?<eos> Well we don't.
"Here is to pure Blood"!<eos> "Pure Blood"!<eos> Let me go!<eos> - Let go of him!<eos> - Let me go!<eos> - Let go of him!<eos> - Don't come any closer or I'll cut his throat!<eos> Eve! ...<eos> Open the door!<eos> - Eve! Don't do it! Eve!
I want to kiss you, kiss you in your mouth and swallow you whole, all raw.<eos> That's disgusting!<eos> No.<eos> This way, we'll never leave each other.<eos> But I don't want to.<eos> Me a daddy seahorse with you in my pouch. I don't like seahorses!<eos> They're ugly!<eos> - I don't want you to swallow me.<eos> - But I just meant I love you.<eos> I don't.
Why are you laughing?<eos> You don't often ask after others.<eos> Especially Irène.<eos> It was your daughter.<eos> I'd have been on for an hour.<eos> Is she well?<eos> My word!<eos> Yes, she's fine.<eos> Did she tell you?<eos> Of course she did.
I haven't, even thought for a second, that you have a husband, a family, you have kids.<eos> That's not your responsibility.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt anybody.<eos> I'm not saying that, I'm just saying I don't think I feel comfortable doing this anymore.<eos> Alice, I've never felt this way, for about anyone.<eos> Okay, listen, I don't wanna do this with him inside.<eos> Really, it's not right.<eos> I think I should go.<eos> I really do.
I guess she became a nun, apparently.<eos> You know what she's like.<eos> - A nun?<eos> - Apparently.<eos> - Did you talk to her?<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Does she know we're coming?<eos> - I think so.<eos> How do you know she wants to see us?<eos> She probably doesn't.
The truth.<eos> He can't just keep pretending to disappear into the ether like this.<eos> Two number twos, nice and hot.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> So what should I tell Geslow?<eos> Buy me a week.<eos> He wants closure on this.<eos> Not as much as I do.
Don't touch me!<eos> Honey!<eos> Honey...<eos> What shall we do?<eos> Gotta find the cop.<eos> The hospital first!<eos> For 8 million, we'll find the cop first.<eos> She's in danger!<eos> - When you have no choice...<eos> - You do the right thing!
And you're really gonna just deliver Jack over to the terrorist to be killed?<eos> - Nadia!<eos> - We need to stop Assad.<eos> But why aren't we organizing a rescue?<eos> We can just grab Jack once Fayed gives us Assad's location.<eos> Fayed has the ressources to detect our surveillance.<eos> As part of the deal, we gave Fayed monitoring access to our satellite coverage, radio frequences and air corridors.<eos> He won't give us anything until he's free and clear with Jack.<eos> How do we even know he'll do what he says?<eos> We don't.
Look at yourself.<eos> - Your Majesty!<eos> - Are you alright? Don't panic.<eos> Only natural.<eos> He finds his mom... kills his sow.<eos> It's the emotion.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do you know you sleepwalk?<eos> You sucked Zima's breast.<eos> - I did?
Are you in love with her?<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> Amy told me how you got those skin grafts.<eos> And the way you're always watching out for her.<eos> And I see the way you look at her.<eos> Have you told her how you feel?<eos> She has a six-year-old daughter.<eos> Women with daughters can still fall in love.<eos> I know.<eos> Because she did. With my brother.
- You made me a mix?<eos> - I made you a mix.<eos> - I'm Aubrey.<eos> - Eddie.<eos> Interesting selections. Especially track two.<eos> Pegged you for more of a John Cougar Mellencamp guy than a John Cougar guy.<eos> So, uh, maybe want to hang out sometime, talk a little more evolution of Mellencamp?<eos> Tonight good? - I'm meeting some friends at Sully's.<eos> - Maybe I stop by?<eos> Maybe you do.
Worst case scenario, we can always dial the Gate manually.<eos> Right, kick it rotary style.<eos> We still need a power source.<eos> What about the MALP?<eos> No!<eos> - Seaweed.<eos> - Don't go there. Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> So therefore, next check-in is in just under six hours.<eos> Good. Muscles, that means that we have time to go to the party.<eos> No it does not!
Change your plans.<eos> Hopper's not at his place.<eos> You called Chad?<eos> Does he know I'm here?<eos> He must have called SWAT.<eos> Why him?<eos> Why did you call Chad?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Think, there must be some reason.<eos> I don't...
My mother died?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Your father told me many years ago.<eos> He had no reason to lie.<eos> This is the last conversation we have about this.<eos> Now you need to go back home, and forget about your real parents.<eos> The groomer missed one of Mr. Muggles' nails.<eos> I'm gonna run him back by the shop before they close.<eos> Don't want you scratching up my wood floors.<eos> No, we don't.
Well, if it's so awful, why are you still here?<eos> Believe me, I wake up every morning and I ask myself the same question.<eos> You know why you're here.<eos> And I do, too.<eos> You're lucky, Sam.<eos> At least, in CID, you have a chance to make a difference, and you do.<eos> -Do I?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> And...<eos> To me, you do, too.
Aye, Odin.<eos> He giggles his amusement as he curses the boy to walk this earth bearing the guise of a beast, and to fall upon his family and his friends, ripping their flesh and smashing their bones, with no way or will to stop the terror<eos> What are you to Ragnar?<eos> Answer me!<eos> What do you know of Ragnar?<eos> - Where is she?<eos> Freya... where is she?<eos> - I don't know where she...<eos> - You told her, didn't you?<eos> - What if I did?
All right, I'm a mess, you're a disaster.<eos> We're both liars.<eos> But you run, you'll always be running.<eos> I say we stay and fight.<eos> We finish this thing.<eos> Then if you want to go, you can go.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> What? "Let's call this what it is." Jesus Christ...<eos> - Stop...<eos> - Don't.
So....<eos> So how's the city?<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's been a little crazy lately, but....<eos> You got a girlfriend?<eos> Actually, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> How about you?<eos> -Do I have a girlfriend?<eos> -No. -No, I don't.
Period!<eos> Angie, there were security cameras.<eos> - Hold the door.<eos> You going down?<eos> - Not if I can help it.<eos> A new case?<eos> The big score? The mother lode?<eos> The one you've been waiting for?<eos> - Humor me.<eos> - Don't I always?
In the upstairs wardrobe.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Um, the wardrobe, upstairs.<eos> Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.<eos> She won't stop going on about it.<eos> - What was it like?<eos> - Like talking to a lunatic.<eos> No, no, no, not her. The forest.<eos> - You're not saying you believe her?<eos> - You don't?
Like Mary Beth in Human Resources?<eos> Oome on, this is...<eos> this is insane. They're gonna kill you for botching a job? Mm-hm.<eos> Well, can't you just, you know, say to them, you know, "You know what?<eos> You know, I was a little burned out, and I'm a little messed up."<eos> I mean, can't you do that?<eos> But... I mean, you were seeing images of yourself as a small boy.<eos> If that's not a Freudian meltdown, I don't know what is.<eos> But certainly, they have to see that.<eos> No, they don't. They don't.
- What about people?<eos> Well, why would I wanna send a person?<eos> They don't taste very good at all.<eos> Don't you realize what you've invented?<eos> It's a teleporter.<eos> It's the most important invention in the history of the world.<eos> And all you think about is chocolate.<eos> Calm down, Mike.<eos> I think Mr. Wonka knows what he's talking about.<eos> No, he doesn't.
You're a businessman. She's an artist. You're white.<eos> She's black. Did I miss anything?<eos> No.<eos> That's just it.<eos> She's everything I'm not.<eos> You know, she's my other half.<eos> Without her, I'm not whole.<eos> You know, the thing about meeting your other half is... you're walking around, you think you're happy... you think that you're whole.<eos> Then you can't go back to being a half... 'cause now you know what it's like to be a whole.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay, what about all the talk about my dignity?<eos> Do you love her?<eos> Do you want her?<eos> Then she's always right.<eos> Look, I know I didn't give you a fair shake.<eos> And I was wrong.<eos> And my daughter, she'd be lucky to have you.<eos> I'm not a quitter, Mr. Jones.<eos> I think I know that about you.<eos> Theresa doesn't.
It's okay.<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> Tha-- oh!<eos> Tha-- oh!<eos> He looked like a madman.<eos> He is a madman.<eos> Do you think he's gonna make it on his own?<eos> Who cares?<eos> I don't know why you care anymore.<eos> I don't. I don't.
Honey, would you go upstairs and change into something else, please?<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> Not for dinner, no.<eos> Why not?<eos> You know why.<eos> She looks so pretty.<eos> Let's just eat.<eos> I think you look really beautiful.<eos> Did Daddy tell you that my mommy died?<eos> Yes, he did.
Talk to me.<eos> What does he say?<eos> He says he would have satisfied her.<eos> Who told you to say that?<eos> Charlie did.<eos> No, who... who told you that?<eos> Charlie did.<eos> There is no Charlie.<eos> Who said it?<eos> Charlie did!
Can you cut me some slack. For old times' sake.<eos> Jartsa...<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Hi there.<eos> Allow me to demonstrate this vacuum cleaner.<eos> What brand do you use?<eos> - An ordinary one.<eos> Have you ever seen one of these?<eos> Do you speak Finnish?<eos> - No, no. What sort of shampoo do the kids...
- You gonna stop me?<eos> What do you think you're doing, Dode?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I saw what you did.<eos> - What did you see?<eos> - I saw you. - What'd you see me...<eos> - I was in the tunnel, and I saw you!<eos> You were with her, dead, and you took the body!<eos> I saw you hide it!<eos> Yeah, I did.
That was all you. Come on, Mom, just this one time.<eos> I'll be back by eleven.<eos> You have a 5:30 am practice tomorrow.<eos> Think you're gonna be all sparkly for that if I let you stay out all hours?<eos> Mom, I landed my Axel. Can't I just have one Saturday night, please?<eos> Who are you going with?<eos> Hi, um... D'you wanna hang out tonight?<eos> With you?<eos> Yeah, you know, get something to eat.<eos> - Maybe do a movie or something.
- Who'd read it?<eos> How about a martial-arts novel? People love them.<eos> That's too hard.<eos> I tried once, co-writing it with someone.<eos> We locked ourselves away for months.<eos> Just got sore heads.<eos> Those were good times.<eos> I like writing too.<eos> It's hard to make a living by writing.<eos> I just do it for fun.
Communist agitation?<eos> If you can prove it ...<eos> I can.<eos> Ljust need a little time.<eos> "Workers and soldiers, Stop working forthe war effort!<eos> Don't go to the front.<eos> Fight with us for peace. Forthe People's Front. Forfreedom, against the Nazis.<eos> The People's Front."<eos> Does that ring any bells?<eos> Does it?
- It's taken care of. - Yes. Yes.<eos> Who did you invite? Because obviously whoever you invited decided not to come.<eos> - The seats will be filled, I promise.<eos> - Yes. You've been promising me all...<eos> - Charles? - Hello, Mr Stanley.<eos> Have you seen the Davies family this evening?<eos> No, sir.<eos> - Jack has gone to get Dr Brighton.<eos> - No, Mother. I don't need a doctor.<eos> Yes, you do, dear.
There·s nothing to be upset about.<eos> - Everything·s fine.<eos> - lt·s not fine.<eos> I was worried.<eos> Walter, I love you, but you expect me to be a mind reader.<eos> I love you.<eos> I really love you.<eos> Do you...?<eos> Do you know that?<eos> I really do.
I hated that skirt.<eos> You don't like that shirt too, huh?<eos> Came with the skirt.<eos> I see.<eos> I mean, I really see.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You like my perfume?<eos> Smell it.<eos> - Actually, I've been a little stuffed up, feeling nasally.<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
- Buck up. Let's do it.<eos> How are you?<eos> How's it goin'?<eos> All right. How you doin'?<eos> All right.<eos> Look at these two hot chickens.<eos> Finkle wants some dinkle. Give it to me, huh?<eos> Come on, do it.<eos> Lay it on right here.<eos> Do it.
Lay it on right here.<eos> Do it.<eos> He means a kiss. We're doin' little voices undercover.<eos> All right.<eos> OK. That's a sweet little pucker.<eos> I love it. - Hi.<eos> Can I get you two a drink?<eos> - You sure can.<eos> Johnnie Red neat, OK? Do it.<eos> Do it.
- He rides a horse, for God's sakes.<eos> - Excuse me, do you have a ticket? Come on, Hoss.<eos> You gotta trust the kid fer once. I can't, cowboy.<eos> I need to see the ticket to make sure it matches. Pop the trunk. Let's get a whiff of that new-car smell.<eos> - Who wants a whiff of that new-car smell?<eos> - Let's smell it.<eos> That's what I'm talkin' about.<eos> Come on, pop the trunk.<eos> Seriously. Do it.<eos> Do it.

Meanwhile in Spain, the Civil War rages out of control.<eos> Artillery fire and incendiary bombs rain down on Madrid, as the fighting intensifies.<eos> The British embassy is hit.<eos> These are the daily scenes in the bombed-out districts.<eos> The civilian population is fleeing the city in droves.<eos> In Paris, Lucille Paré presents her new creations.<eos> I thought you might change your mind.<eos> Guy tells me I'm very stubborn.<eos> - l assume he doesn't know where you are?<eos> No one does.
You, Senator, you are the lawmaker.<eos> If you pass a law that states no one can entertain Air Force officers, well, hell, I'd be happy to abide by it.<eos> Senator Brewster, your story is a pack of lies, and I can tear it apart if allowed to cross examine you.<eos> We're not going to have this bickering back and forth.<eos> Somewhere between 200 and 500, if you'll just let me get started...<eos> If you believe that because of your great wealth and power you can intimidate any member of this committee, I want to advise you that you're mistaken.<eos> Now, submit your questions.<eos> Now, I'll put this very simply.<eos> On February 1 2, at the Mayflower Hotel, did you or did you not tell me that if I were to sell TWA to Pan Am that this entire investigation would be called off?<eos> No, I did not.
You mean your designer.<eos> Yes.<eos> So why'd you murder him?<eos> I did not murder Dr. Lanning.<eos> Wanna explain why you were hiding at the crime scene?<eos> I was frightened.<eos> Robots don't feel fear.<eos> They don't feel anything.<eos> - They don't get hungry, they don't sleep.<eos> - I do.
But I'm in.<eos> Otherwise I can forget about my gym<eos> We take him to the airport and tackle them.<eos> Alright, but quickly.<eos> Take me with you...<eos> There she is.<eos> There.<eos> Tsu, Kien wants to talk to you.<eos> Tell him he solves it by himself<eos> - Do it yourself.
You and your barbarian mother live in shame.<eos> Cleitus.<eos> Oh, my Cleitus. Cleitus.<eos> - Let me pass. - None can enter.<eos> I am the queen.<eos> I want to see him.<eos> I've waited three days.<eos> He says none, not even you.<eos> - He needs me.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Thank you very much.<eos> No, maybe not in my neighborhood.<eos> Hey, Boomer, I really got to run.<eos> Gotta fly, everybody.<eos> Really.<eos> Stay behind the security fence.<eos> It's great of you to come see me, but I've got somebody waiting, very devoted, almost crippled.<eos> No, please, don't cry.<eos> I know what it's like to be unloved.<eos> Well, you do.
Santa came to Iraq just for you guys. Trying to keep skies clear for you, Santa.<eos> Do you consider yourself a proud American?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'm an extremely proud American.<eos> I'm probably more proud than the average Joe.<eos> When I put my flag out, I can't allow it to touch the ground. Because I know the lives that were lost and the blood that was shed so that I could be here and have a flag.<eos> - How often do you put the flag out?<eos> - Every single day. Every day. I started when my daughter was in Desert Storm.<eos> I had the same flag flying on my front porch and the same yellow ribbons. Praying and hoping every day that my child would come home safe. And everybody's child would come home safe.<eos> - And she did.
I think you handled yourself really well today, considering everything.<eos> The McGill Foundation would be really honored if you would represent us at Oxford University next year.<eos> But...<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - I found these.<eos> This would have been an amazing speech.<eos> It's not just that you wanted to win it's that you absolutely refused to fail.<eos> And you didn't.<eos> You deserve this fellowship, Jane.<eos> You really do.
- If you want to argue, argue with this.<eos> - Relax. Shut your fucking mouth.<eos> - Move the gun.<eos> - You can't turn them away. They'll die.<eos> Tough shit.<eos> Self-defense.<eos> - I won't kill anybody.<eos> - I'll kill you.<eos> - Stop it, CJ.<eos> Don't do this.
So maybe I fake... just make some bucks, who knows?<eos> - Recognize him?<eos> - Khan.<eos> Like Genghis.<eos> Nice guy for Moslem.<eos> Was he the man who tried to buy the Uranium from you, Vlenko?<eos> Will you testify to that in a court of law?<eos> Only if she don't do more beat-ups.<eos> Do you, Admiral Theodore McKee, without any mental reservation... or purpose of evasion, solemnly swear to defend this nation... against all enemies, foreign and domestic... and swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America?<eos> I do.
And it's gonna have my name on it.<eos> I'd be more than happy to write your ending, Mr. Shooter.<eos> Saw that wife of yours coming out of the house.<eos> - She's purty.<eos> - My wife?<eos> Why don't we just leave her out of this.<eos> Would if I could but I'm starting to think you ain't gonna leave me that option.<eos> You want to wake up from one of your stupid naps and find Amy nailed to your garbage bin?<eos> Or turn on the radio some morning and hear she came off second-best in a match with the chain saw you keep out in the shed?<eos> Do you?
- What I'm owed, mija.<eos> What I'm owed. - I don't owe you anything.<eos> Seven fucking million dollars.<eos> That debt don't die with him!<eos> Look at me.<eos> Three days, I'll be back, mija.<eos> And you don't want to fuck with me, muchacha.<eos> Cicatriz.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
I'm feeling really bad.<eos> I'm back home.<eos> Home?<eos> But if you're not feeling good... I'm not feeling good because I was in the hospital too long.<eos> Hospitals make you sick.<eos> That's why they're full of sick people.<eos> Are you still there?<eos> I've got to take my pills now.<eos> I only take them... so the nurse doesn't feel guilty.<eos> I do it for her, not for me.
Clock him close.<eos> He's not going anywhere.<eos> I'm hand-carrying this thing right into the museum. Stan, you've got more cover on you than the president.<eos> The diamond is safe.<eos> This is an armed caravan, completely bulletproof, magnetic locks.<eos> - This transfer is under control. - I'm hot.<eos> FBI Travel Link climate control.<eos> I don't understand your command.<eos> I don't understand your command.<eos> I don't under... I don't... I don't...
My campaign people are getting a restraining order against him.<eos> He's going on every security watch list, but I won't lock him up.<eos> - I'm not pressing charges.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't know, it's just..<eos> I don't wanna talk about this right now.<eos> Can we get back to the campaign and focus on something..<eos> Raymond, you don't actually believe his story?<eos> No.<eos> But he does.
May I?<eos> I've been working at the palace<eos> Just to pass the time away<eos> Can't you hear the bells a-ringing?<eos> Rise up so early in the morn<eos> Can't you hear the bells a-shouting?<eos> Maids, go do your chores<eos> And now, to end our little show, if we all give her a shout-out, Her Majesty may sing us a song.<eos> Thank you, no.<eos> Queens rarely do karaoke.
- It was an accident. I'm not liable.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> I'm making you liable.<eos> It's coming out of your goddamn pocket.<eos> You tell him to stick this cab up his fat ass.<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> That's my boss.<eos> - So?<eos> - I need my job.<eos> - No, you don't.
Oh, man.<eos> You're right.<eos> What was it they said? - It would be smart...<eos> - To leave quickly and quietly.<eos> Hey-ho.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Why did you have to spoil the fun? - When?<eos> - Let the others deal with it.<eos> Tell them all that the deal is a dream... and that the Purifiers are history.<eos> Done. John, John.
You're older.<eos> Older than I thought you'd be.<eos> That picture.<eos> Does that mean a lot to you?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> It's just a picture.<eos> No.<eos> It's because you don't know how they died.<eos> I do.<eos> No, you don't.
It's ok<eos> You okay?<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> How did we let it happen, Sandy?<eos> Em... I'm not sure exactly which it we're talking about.<eos> Everything's going to be okay.<eos> We should save what every little money we have left<eos> We both know what the test gonna say<eos> -No,we don't
- Where is he?<eos> He called one hour ago... but wouldn't say where he was.<eos> He didn't kill Norton.<eos> Bill Caputo did.<eos> It was Bill Caputo's truck they saw driving away.<eos> Joe Monroe doesn't have to die.<eos> The Anagress works.<eos> All we have to do is get him back on the medication.<eos> - Anagress doesn't work.<eos> - Anagress does work.
All right. Come here.<eos> Do not drink too much, do you hear me?<eos> I don't want you passing out or going to the dark side.<eos> -No going to the dark side. -Okay.<eos> Hi. Just looking for some friends.<eos> -Good evening, ladies.<eos> How are you? -How are you?<eos> Hello, Maya.<eos> You look gorgeous.<eos> You both do.
Joey, I'm at work, okay?<eos> I can't deal with this right now.<eos> I'm trying to explain. We'll talk about this later.<eos> I'm trying to explain to you that... what?<eos> It's just really difficult.<eos> It's... because nobody understands. I do understand. Do you?<eos> Do you really understand me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you want me to talk to him?<eos> Of course I don't.
"He was a convivial fellow." Meaning he was an alcoholic.<eos> "He valued his privacy." Gay.<eos> "He enjoyed his privacy." Raging queen.<eos> What would my euphemism be?<eos> - "She was disarming."<eos> - That's not a euphemism.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> - What were you doing in New York?<eos> - You know.<eos> Well, no, I don't.
- But I poured us some.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> You can't fall asleep in the pussy, that's not right.<eos> - Have you taken anything?<eos> Tell me.<eos> - No, no!<eos> - I haven't taken anything.<eos> - Did you sleep last night?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- You ruined my trousers.<eos> You little bandit.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - l dropped the paint.<eos> - Where's the toilet?<eos> - Stay there a second, please.<eos> What are you laughing at?<eos> You've ruined my clothes.<eos> - You hardly notice it. I can't see it.<eos> - Of course you do.
Why don't you take it all?<eos> Please take it.<eos> - l don't have to bring it back?<eos> - No, just take it.<eos> - Why don't we call it a day?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> You know the bank, right ...?<eos> You know about the robbery?<eos> Michael wanted me to go and see the lady and apologize.<eos> Of course he did.
Are you sure you don't know how?<eos> I know how to do this.<eos> I can show you.<eos> Let him go and I'll show you.<eos> Let him go and I'll show you.<eos> Show us again, slowly this time.<eos> Let him go.<eos> And give him water.<eos> He needs water.<eos> We both do.
Unique among all women, as pure as the virgin snow... but I ask, what is troubling you?<eos> Joseph, husband, there's been a miracle.<eos> As I stand before you, I must tell you...<eos> I'm with child.<eos> But Mary, how could this be?<eos> In accordance with God's wishes, we never lay together... as man and wife.<eos> Yes it is true, and I beg you that you believe when I tell you...<eos> I've never lain with any man at all.<eos> Do you believe me, Joseph?<eos> Do you?
You're really something aren't you?<eos> I warned you before, didn't I?<eos> What does your father do? What does he do?<eos> He runs a Taekwondo gym<eos> A Taekwondo gym?<eos> So he raised you to be a punk<eos> Tell me<eos> Did your old man teach you to fight at school?<eos> Did he?<eos> Did he, asshole?
Run!<eos> Why do you want to save me?<eos> Even though we have different ambitions. But we have grown up together like sisters.<eos> You never understood me.<eos> Is it so important to become an Empress?<eos> If I cannot become one during this lifetime, ...I will never be a happy ghost!<eos> Hold on, don't let go.<eos> I don't want to die so young.<eos> Don't worry, we won't die.<eos> What if I did?
What sex? Mom!<eos> Tosia is only fifteen.<eos> First crush and sex are miles and miles apart.<eos> But you think about sex.<eos> You accept the fact<eos> - that your daughter could...<eos> - Yes.<eos> I accept that.<eos> Maybe not yet, but I do accept that.<eos> - And you don't.
-Hi.<eos> -Hi.<eos> -I just wanted to thank you.<eos> -For what?<eos> For forgetting to put your shoes on.<eos> That's the nicest compliment I've ever been paid.<eos> -Coffee?<eos> -Yes, please.<eos> I don't forget everything that I don't write down.<eos> You don't?
I want to see my kids.<eos> I can't leave...<eos> We can't leave him there.<eos> He must be taken somewhere.<eos> You scared us, Mrs. Lopez.<eos> Don't drink so much water.<eos> Two or three liters a day tops.<eos> What is that needle?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> You don't.
Then live.<eos> Live.<eos> Who's stopping you?<eos> I want to be human again.<eos> You want to be human?<eos> Then behave like a human being.<eos> Do you behave like human beings?<eos> I loved him and you people gave me to him like food.<eos> And then killed him.<eos> You did.
Yip<eos> You know how to cook?<eos> Of course<eos> Cook something for 7 people No problem<eos> Go back to your homework<eos> Sit down<eos> Got an electric shock Little girl, how do you plug this in?<eos> How come you unplugged the wire?<eos> Can you cook?<eos> Usually Big Sis and I do the cooking
- No problem.<eos> Ha, you see.<eos> - Don't rude!<eos> Thank you.<eos> - That's too embarassing, Papa! So, you take that one...<eos> Lilly!<eos> - Joshua!<eos> Take care of your mother.<eos> I take that one, I know the way.<eos> - The drivers do as well.
- What a joke! Sergeant Cook? - What?<eos> This is some news! Everybody's gotta know.<eos> If you do, I'll kill you asswhole.<eos> Oh, you will?<eos> Alright, go ahead.<eos> What? You scared? Hey!<eos> - Just do me a favor.<eos> I'm begging you.<eos> Don't come any closer!<eos> I don't No, No!
I think that everyone has his own way of showing<eos> I think he does not want anything from me<eos> Well you already had something<eos> I do not trust myself for that yet<eos> I am so afraid that he thinks my breasts are too small<eos> Just look at what features these have<eos> I beg your pardon? I do want to sleep with him<eos> I have nothing against that, in principle<eos> No I meant the other thing you just said<eos> What did I do already?
What's the point now? It won't help!<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Carl, you go first.<eos> We ain't talking no more today.<eos> Tim is staying. We'll talk things out ourselves.<eos> I can't go like this.<eos> Why not?<eos> Go.<eos> Tim, I'll make it up for you if I've got a son.<eos> But I don't.
"What's going on, here?" The punters will wet themselves.<eos> They will?<eos> Undoubtedly.<eos> I wonder.<eos> Trust me on this.<eos> Guaranteed hilarity.<eos> So the police officer's the butt of your joke.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> That's what you said.<eos> No, I didn't.
courageous and shy, full of fortitude and delicate,<eos> a princess with the heart of a peasant girl, a peasant girl with the heart of a princess.<eos> In a passionate voice she will sing my songs...<eos> Beautiful without the arrogance of beauty, noble without the arrogance of nobility, pious without the arrogance of piety...<eos> Jaufré, Jaufré.<eos> Such a woman does not exist!<eos> Tell him, Pilgrim, you who have traveled the world, tell him!<eos> Such a woman does not exist!<eos> Maybe she does not exist,<eos> but maybe she does.
Hey!<eos> I said you may leave.<eos> I have something to ask the Senior Retainer.<eos> What?<eos> Did you receive a visit last night from Hazama's wife?<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Hazama's wife came to my house last night.<eos> She said she was going to see you.<eos> Yes.<eos> She did.
- He'd never believe me.<eos> - Make him believe you.<eos> I miss you.<eos> Do you miss me?<eos> - Oh, what difference would it make?<eos> - It could make a lot of difference.<eos> Julia, stop it.<eos> We can't.<eos> - Do you think of me?<eos> - Don't do this.
- You put Nina in a room with Richards.<eos> You got no information and three dead agents.<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> - You're gonna have to trust me.<eos> - All right.<eos> Jack, we got some readings off the incubator.<eos> That was Ryan.<eos> The virus has been released at the Chandler Plaza Hotel.<eos> There are 11 other vials. We don't know where they are or when they're gonna be released.<eos> He probably does.
Besides you heard the man.<eos> We got enough problems of our own to worry about.<eos> Come to tap-dance on the patient, have we, doc?<eos> I'd give you the finger, but I won't have the motor skills till the drugs wear off.<eos> A lot of pain?<eos> More than I'd like.<eos> But not as much as you would.<eos> Just what I deserve.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> No I did.
Right.<eos> Could be the Joker.<eos> From the comic books.<eos> Just trying to think outside the box.<eos> I know Valentine's was last week, but... I didn't take the discount on the card.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> I was thinking maybe we could talk about it again.<eos> I'm sorry, Knox but you have work to do.<eos> I do.
Oh... Are you saying you want to talk to the hand?<eos> I think he does.<eos> Come on, fat boy why don't you talk to the hand.<eos> [PUPPETS LAUGHING] Make him swallow his tongue again.<eos> ANGEL: Uh, Nina?<eos> Angel?<eos> Yeah, sort of.<eos> Listen, I want to apologize about the way I treated you this morning.<eos> - Look, Angel, I understand.<eos> - Pretty sure you don't.
I don't know.<eos> I can't put my finger on it.<eos> I'm like in this rut or something, you know?<eos> I just feel really disconnected.<eos> Yeah, I agree.<eos> You agree?<eos> What do you know about my ruts?<eos> Well, um, i know you gave some great advice to "lost in los altos" about finding new love, but, uh, you gave the same advice to "dumped in daly" last year.<eos> shut up. i did not. are you kidding?<eos> Oh, my god. I did.
Save your son.<eos> what do you want?<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> How'd you know i was here?<eos> I didn't, wyatt did.<eos> Must be that orbing thing you guys share.<eos> He looked up and said, "da-da."<eos> Really?<eos> He misses you.<eos> We all do.
It's no big deal.<eos> I blew him up, he's gone.<eos> You know every time you say that they come back with a vengeance.<eos> - Kiss of death.<eos> - It doesn't matter, because I'm on it full-time now.<eos> I'm actually thinking of selling the club because I have a new mission in life.<eos> And it's all become very clear to me.<eos> Would you care to elaborate?<eos> Do you guys know that Wyatt called me "Mama"?<eos> - He did? Oh, his first word.
- And I will go start the love potion.<eos> Wait.<eos> I thought you were against making the love potion.<eos> Not if it's gonna save one of my two favourite nephews.<eos> - Nice play, my friend.<eos> - It worked, didn't it?<eos> Not yet it hasn't.<eos> Not until the witches come after you.<eos> They'll come.<eos> - They always do.
What are you doing?<eos> Just trying to sense them.<eos> Any luck?<eos> You don't look so good.<eos> I know.<eos> Listen, about last night...<eos> I don't have any regrets, if that's where this is going.<eos> It's not.<eos> But I'm glad you said that.<eos> Because I don't either.
No.<eos> No magic. I told you.<eos> I've done some soul-searching.<eos> I wanna help again, but I don't wanna go there anymore.<eos> Darryl, you gotta get over this.<eos> I mean, really, one bad experience with magic can't outweigh six years of good, can it?<eos> Hey, Paige.<eos> Hey, Darryl.<eos> Uh, I thought you were on your date.<eos> Yeah. So did I.
One.<eos> Breakfast at our house is no longer clothing optional.<eos> - All meals.<eos> - All meals. - Fine.<eos> - Two, and most important-- you touch my fucking pop tarts again and your "monster" is going to get it in his sleep.<eos> Fine, and F.Y.I., I like strawberry frosted the best.<eos> In addition to eating my groceries, you might want to start providing them.<eos> You need to earn your keep.<eos> I-- all right!<eos> All right... I--I'll do some chores.
It was your dog.<eos> I get it.<eos> Actually, he was my wife's dog, one of the last thing's she said to me in the hospital before she died was to be sure I looked after him and I promised her I would.<eos> And just like that, Susan could suddenly se something she'd never sen before.<eos> He, uh, meant so much to her.<eos> Mike Delfino was still in love with his late wife.<eos> And if something had happened, I would've felt like I'd failed her.<eos> I know that sounds stupid, but...<eos> And she knew right then, neither she nor Edie would be laying claim to his heart any time soon.<eos> No, it doesn't. Not at all.
I got so upset when Andrew and Danielle were little, I used their nap times to cry. I used their nap times to cry.<eos> Why didn't you ever tell me this?<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> Nobody likes to admit that they can't handle the pressure.<eos> I think it's just like we think, you know, it's easier to keep it all in.<eos> Oh, we shouldn't!<eos> We should tell each other this stuff!<eos> - It helps, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It really does.
Do you guys not see the problem here?<eos> Vince said she was staying a couple of nights, all right? A couple is two.<eos> Except in Utah.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Stop doing fucking yoga, man.<eos> It's embarrassing.<eos> - She thinks she's his trainer.<eos> - So do you.
- Pretty much my same reaction.<eos> But Gigi? She just takes off on Gigi?<eos> Okay, well, you smell as good as you look.<eos> - I haven't showered since Seattle.<eos> - Really?<eos> Well, I'm hot.<eos> Okay, how about this for a plan?<eos> You go take a shower... and I will order some food, and I'll start to clean up...<eos> - Hey, I can't do this.<eos> - Do what, shower?
- Well, babies hate you.<eos> - They do not hate me.<eos> All I'm saying is we have limited time together... the three of us, and we cannot afford to waste it... the three of us, and he's cutting in.<eos> Michel, I'm not cutting in.<eos> But the fact is, wherever Sookie goes, the baby goes... and wherever the baby goes, I go.<eos> It's my job.<eos> We even made a little joke earlier.<eos> "The baby has a meeting today."<eos> - I love this.<eos> - We do, too.
Oh, three years.<eos> She's my best rôtisseur.<eos> And what's that?<eos> The rôtisseur prepares the roasted meats and gravies.<eos> How do you clean your grill?<eos> You say "elbow grease".<eos> Do you use chemical cleaners?<eos> Ah, non.<eos> Absolument.<eos> And chefs don't do the cleaning anyway.
THEY HAVE REALLY CHEAP TICKETS.<eos> YEAH, I KNOW, BUT IT'S STILL KINDA HARD TO GET- YEAH. NO, GO TO ARGENTINA.<eos> OK. OK.<eos> OK.<eos> HEY, CAR, HOW ARE WE DOING ON THOSE DRINKS?<eos> THEY'RE COMING!<eos> EGGROLLS IN THE HOUSE. OH, AND GOOD NEWS. CHEF MING HAD THE BABY.<eos> BRIAN. HOL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?<eos> CARRIE INVITED ME OVER.<eos> DID SHE?
OH, NO. NO. WE LOOKED AROUND, BUT WE COULDN'T AGREE ON ONE.<eos> YEAH, IT'S HARD.<eos> EMILY, UH...<eos> CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?<eos> SURE. UH, DID I DO ANYTHING THE OTHER NIGHT TO OFFEND YOU IN ANY WAY?<eos> NOT AT ALL.<eos> I KNOW I CAN BE OPINIONATED SOMETIMES.<eos> I TALK BEFORE I THINK, AND I-<eos> CARRIE, I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.<eos> REALLY. YOU DO? YEAH.
Look, all I know is Sean is pretty convinced in what he saw.<eos> And you believe him over me?<eos> Look, I don't know, maybe there was something good on the trash can!<eos> You know, some leftover sloppy Joe, some chocolate sauce.<eos> Who can blame ya?<eos> I never licked it, OK?<eos> For the last time, my head was in that trash can because I was looking for my six million dollar man thermos top!<eos> Look, you licked it, you didn't lick it, what's the difference?<eos> There's a big difference! One way, I licked a trash can!<eos> The other way, I didn't!
It's an open call for the part of Mrs. Simons, alien 1, 2 and 3, and Ted's grandmother.<eos> "Curse of the Romalians: Return to Gondor Part 2." Is this a Lichtman film?<eos> Gerard Lichtman. The German director.<eos> The director is Matt Fried, he's 22 and he's from Pasadena.<eos> Plus, he's a total asshole.<eos> Hey, man. Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> About what?<eos> Trish?<eos> Yeah, well, look. Trish needs support right now. She doesn't need to be chewed out in front of the whole team.<eos> Yeah? Well, I don't, either.
I mean, writers crave experience.<eos> What if that's all it was with Marina?<eos> What?<eos> Craving experience?<eos> You think so? I think it was you fucking dykes...<eos> Don't curse us all.<eos> Tina and I left your dinner party because we didn't wanna be any part of it.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> You didn't know it was already going on then?<eos> Tim, I didn't...
is that right?<eos> Why don't you tell me about it?<eos> OK.<eos> There was this girl... ..with short, black hair.<eos> And she walks out... ..and takes off her clothes in two seconds flat.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Like this?<eos> I think it was a little bit faster.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Because there's nobody left to watch my back.<eos> They're all dead.<eos> Every single one of them.<eos> I know.<eos> I had to call in an air strike... right on top of us.<eos> You had no choice, Danny.<eos> I mean... you were being overrun... and you absolutely had no choice at all.<eos> Why don't you just go and take a shower and clean yourself up?<eos> Did you ever have to do what I had to do?<eos> Yeah, I did.
And Jack just took off.<eos> Claire could've died!<eos> I tried to give her some sooner, but it just got out of hand.<eos> - No one would've understood.<eos> - What is going on?<eos> Someone had to take responsibility for it.<eos> It would've never lasted!<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> It's been six days, and we're all still waiting... waiting for someone to come.<eos> But what if they don't?
Guess he didn't like what he had to say.<eos> Colonel Ryan didn't do this.<eos> How can you tell?<eos> Somebody stormed this place.<eos> He wouldn't shoot the lock off his own door.<eos> Any idea who, boss?<eos> Not yet.<eos> You think he knows more than he's telling us?<eos> Come on, Kate, this is Gibbs we're talking about.<eos> Of course he does.
There was evidence of a break-in and a gun battle at his cabin. We need to see it.<eos> So do we.<eos> Unfortunately, it was incinerated in the explosion.<eos> That's pretty convenient.<eos> Hey, all this started because you people lied to us.<eos> Agent Todd, if Ryan's innocent, how did my man end up handcuffed at his cabin in the first place?<eos> I'll get you your evidence. How?<eos> Any way I can.<eos> Your boss is playing a dangerous game. - He doesn't play games.<eos> - Well, neither do we.
Been with the Navy almost 15 years.<eos> It was his life.<eos> Never married?<eos> Well, if he was, it was before he arrived here.<eos> - How well did you know him?<eos> - Not very.<eos> You were his commanding officer.<eos> Commander Julius was a bit of an odd duck,<eos> - if you know what I mean.<eos> - I don't.
See if you remember any of them from the club last night.<eos> That's a waste of time.<eos> I mean, there were over 500...<eos> Hey, I remember him.<eos> I notice people's hair.<eos> You know, him and his buddies were the only ones had cuts like that.<eos> Are these the buddies that were with him?<eos> Yep.<eos> - Do you remember what time he left?<eos> - He didn't.
Actually. Before I remembered your doctor's appointment.<eos> Except you didn't remember.<eos> I've been to every doctor's appointment.<eos> What are you saying, I don't care?<eos> No, it's just... a plane ticket showing up, phone calls in the middle of the night.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Look, I left Newport to make life easier for everyone.<eos> It seems like all I did was make everything more complicated.<eos> That's funny, I thought you left Newport to be with me.<eos> I did. All right?
So go ahead and give it your best shot.<eos> Ándale, Juan!<eos> Yeah. I'm not a big car-singing kind of guy.<eos> Oh, "bad case of loving you," Per.<eos> Come on, where's the fun?<eos> You don't get this rush at a normal job.<eos> You don't, you don't, you don't.<eos> - Know what I'm saying?<eos> - You're saying you don't.<eos> Well, Per, sometimes you do.
I could spend all day worrying about what happened, but I have more important things to do.<eos> Hey, man, look what I confiscated from one of the kids in paediatrics.<eos> - What, too hot?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Not in the mood!<eos> OK, we both might have had bad days, but I got just the thing that's gonna cheer us up.<eos> - Dream come true, right?<eos> - Do you really think I want this suit?<eos> Well, I do... but not from you!
So I'm only here for a fuck?<eos> Never crossed your mind?<eos> This is all a bit Hans Christian Andersen.<eos> You see, you think you find your dream girl, then her incontinent alcoholic father wrecks it.<eos> - Don't take the piss.<eos> - Don't pretend you don't even know me.<eos> You weren't that drunk.<eos> If the only reason last night happened was because it happened, don't knock it, all right?<eos> At least something did.<eos> It did for me.
What are your physical feelings right now?<eos> I'd like to punch you in the face.<eos> Your hands are clenched.<eos> Did you realise that?<eos> You're provoking me to make a point.<eos> - Maybe that's your job but I don't like it.<eos> - Look at you.<eos> - You're not even listening.<eos> - He's talking to me.<eos> No. You and me, we do most of the talking in here.
Go over there.<eos> You make sure he gets the best.<eos> Thing is, Tone, he's quitting the Bing.<eos> And he told Sil, he goes,<eos> "I'd appreciate if Tony don't come visit me. "<eos> He don't wanna see you.<eos> I told him watch his mouth.<eos> These things happen, T.<eos> That's why I don't like to talk politics.<eos> - You did?
I was jumped by a bunch of mooIinyans.<eos> They were trying to take my shoes.<eos> I fought them off, but they cut my fuckin' head open, the jigaboo cocksucking motherfuckers.<eos> OK, forget that.<eos> Your cousin went to prison.<eos> That's tremendous guilt to carry.<eos> He went to Nam, I was 4F.<eos> And that's the way our friends look at it.<eos> And that's why you favour Tony uncle AI...<eos> And those 1 7 years, I did so good.
- And who else lives here?<eos> - No one.<eos> You're hurting me.<eos> (soldier) We know loyalists are in the area.<eos> - Collaboration is punishable by death.<eos> - (Leda sobs)<eos> Search the house.<eos> (soldier #2) There's no one else here, but we found men's clothes and boots.<eos> - (soldier #1) Who else lives here?<eos> - My husband did.
It was a nightmare.<eos> So is that how you get off?<eos> Treating women like garbage?<eos> I don't treat women like garbage.<eos> Okay?<eos> This girl was messed up.<eos> Maybe she has father issues, I don't wanna know.<eos> The point is, she was asking for it, okay?<eos> And you know what I'm talking about.<eos> No, I don't.
- I don't suppose you know who killed her.<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> - Did you even know she was missing?<eos> - Yeah, we all did.<eos> But that's pretty much par for the course for the shelter.<eos> We filed a report, but the police didn't pay any attention.<eos> It makes them ideal victims, doesn't it?<eos> The homeless.<eos> - No one deserves to die like that.<eos> - No. They don't.
- His name is Kevin Grant.<eos> He's a PFC in the 64th Infantry.<eos> He was wounded three weeks ago in a gunfight outside Tikrit.<eos> He was shipped home last week.<eos> When his shoulder heals... and he clears medical next month, he'll go back to his unit in Iraq.<eos> And what about post-traumatic stress?<eos> He was given full medical and psych evaluations in Ramstein.<eos> But sometimes that can set in later.<eos> How well do you know him, Capt. Meyers?<eos> I don't, actually.
Why don't you just let it go, Terri?<eos> I was supposed to be happy.<eos> And she was supposed to make me happy.<eos> We tried.<eos> But I can tell you this:<eos> If you don't find that baby, Terri's not gonna make it through.<eos> Not with all that guilt she's got.<eos> No, you have to listen to your mother.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, because you do.
Oh, really?<eos> - Time for a swirlie!<eos> - Come on, guys, let him go!<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Let him go!<eos> - On your knees!<eos> You like water?<eos> - Tastes good, doesn't it?<eos> - Don't!
I know everything I can.<eos> The question is, do you know why you are here?<eos> We are looking for the Keymaker.<eos> Oh, yes, it is true.<eos> The Keymaker, of course.<eos> But this is not a reason, this is not a why.<eos> The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is a means, it is not an end.<eos> And so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do what?<eos> - You know the answer to that question.<eos> But do you?
- It's okay.<eos> I'm happy to see you too.<eos> - Did you get Neo out?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - How did you know about that?<eos> - The Oracle.<eos> - You saw her?<eos> - Just before the sentinels found us.<eos> - What did she tell you?<eos> - The same thing she always does.
Do you have a location on car number two?<eos> - Move! Move! Move!<eos> - Roger.<eos> Car Two is stopped at 7 th and Hope.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Tell Fuller it was me who pulled this off, yeah?<eos> I'm not gonna let you get away with this, Gamble.<eos> Well, you ain't got a say in the matter, do you?<eos> Suspects wearing tactical clothing and have automatic weapons.<eos> T.J., don't do this!
Look, I'm gonna go in there, and I'm gonna talk to Kendall and to Dunbar, and I'm gonna try to figure this whole mess out because I care what happened out there.<eos> And I think you do too.<eos> -"l didn't shoot West."<eos> -What?<eos> That's what Dunbar said. "l didn't shoot West." West wasn't shot.<eos> Kendall said he was burned by a phosphorus grenade.<eos> Dunbar never saw the body.<eos> Hey, look, I apologize.<eos> -You saw West's body?<eos> -Of course I did.
Couple of bozos looking for a loan.<eos> And Martin...<eos> I don't see anyone without an appointment.<eos> Understand? Yeah.<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> A bank draft.<eos> This is made out to him.<eos> Hey, you want it made out to you?<eos> No, but, uh...<eos> What do I do with this?
I don't... I don't know.<eos> You're fired, you piece of shit.<eos> Wh...?<eos> Ten on four.<eos> Come on, shooter.<eos> Come on, baby, you've been good so far.<eos> Yeah!<eos> I thought this guy was a chump.<eos> So what do you want to know?<eos> Everything Vegas doesn't.
Here, Joe.<eos> - Joe, I'm going for a beer. Do you want to come?<eos> - No, I'll finish this<eos> Serve yourself<eos> - I see you later - see you later, Les<eos> Les will be back in a minute<eos> He's always late<eos> You scare now?<eos> Do you think he knows?<eos> Of cause he does
He used to tell me stories.<eos> He'd say when they'd hit one, the desert would rain oil.<eos> That's what he did, James. He told stories.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And he lied.<eos> That doesn't mean he didn't love you.<eos> What was he, really?<eos> What did he do?<eos> You gotta come off it, kid.<eos> You really do.
Come by tonight at 5:00.<eos> Adam's ribs.<eos> A very secret society.<eos> Wait here.<eos> First, the oath.<eos> Please raise both hands.<eos> Do you swear not to repeat what you see, hear or smell tonight?<eos> - Smell? - Keep your hands up!<eos> Yes, smell.<eos> I do.
- I don't know anything about a pin.<eos> Are her parents named phillip and vanessa?<eos> You know them?<eos> Only from a distance.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Good morning. - Goodbye.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> No, we have an audience. Don't look.<eos> No, I don't... no.
- Alright, you know what? - What?<eos> I think you're a coward.<eos> You hide out in here because you're too damn bitter and selfish to help any other person.<eos> In my opinion, you're already dead.<eos> I tried calling you last night, but your father said you were sleeping.<eos> - Evan Lewis is dead. - Yeah.<eos> I've been getting calls all morning from everyone who was on the on-ramp.<eos> We're meeting tonight at my apartment. Wait, so...<eos> you believe all this Death stuff?<eos> Well, at first, no, I didn't.
What is this?<eos> Thank you, guys.<eos> Man. - Don't look at us.<eos> That boy likes to dig holes. He'd dig a hole to China, man.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Man, shut up.<eos> Hey, Zero.<eos> Why'd you dig my hole, man?<eos> You didn't steal the sunflower seeds.<eos> Yeah, but neither did you.
Why do I get so scared?<eos> Because I'm not a leaver.<eos> The one time Amanda and I broke up, she left me.<eos> It all happened too fast.<eos> I was overwhelmed by you.<eos> It was a whirlwind and right away, we were living together!<eos> I think we'd both benefit by some time apart.<eos> I don't need time apart.<eos> I know I love you.<eos> Well, I do!
Do you think everybody knows?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you think Karl knows? Yes.<eos> That is... That is bad news.<eos> I just thought that maybe the time had come to do something about it.<eos> Like what?<eos> Invite him out for a drink, and then after about 20 minutes, casually drop into the conversation the fact that you'd like to marry him and have lots of sex and babies.<eos> You know that?<eos> Yes.<eos> And so does Karl.
But he's going to need the special kiss to face his colleagues tonight.<eos> Father? Brave?<eos> There are many different kinds of bravery.<eos> There's the bravery of thinking of others before oneself.<eos> Now, your father has never brandished a sword nor fired a pistol, thank heavens.<eos> But he has made many sacrifices for his family and put away many dreams.<eos> Where did he put them? He put them in a drawer.<eos> And sometimes, late at night, we take them out and admire them.<eos> But it gets harder and harder to close the drawer.<eos> He does.
Stow that gab, or I'll run you through! "Believe in fairies!<eos> I do believe in fairies! I do!<eos> I do! I do believe in fairies.<eos> I do. I do.<eos> I do believe in fairies.<eos> I do. I do.<eos> I do believe in fairies. - I do. -I do.<eos> I do believe in fairies. I do. I do.<eos> I do believe in fairies<eos> I do!
We took some time, talked to the kids, got to know them a bit.<eos> - It made a difference.<eos> It helped them.<eos> - Please. Share your success.<eos> Why don't you tell these people exactly how you help their children?<eos> Max over here is potty-trained now, okay?<eos> - I don't miss.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - And Becca learned how to read.<eos> - Yes, I did.
I just never had proof.<eos> Well, can I ask you a question?<eos> If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?<eos> Because he's dying.<eos> Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this.<eos> You have one image of your father... and it'd be wrong of me to change it... especially this late in the game.<eos> My father talked about things he never did... and I'm sure he did a lot of things that he never talked about.<eos> I'm just trying to reconcile the two.<eos> The first thing you have to understand... is that your father never meant to end up here.<eos> Yet he did.
Look at all this potential out here.<eos> Ray, don't do that, man. You're making me lose money.<eos> Come on, stop that.<eos> I know you're better than that.<eos> Damn.<eos> Your boy can help put that fire out!<eos> Look at the bubble...<eos> Let's go.<eos> Serious. Ray, you're making me lose money.<eos> Don't do that.
Do you have any idea where Katrin is?<eos> No.<eos> But you need to get here right now. Something's wrong with Karl. An emergency!<eos> What happened?<eos> Erwin was here for a meal.<eos> And Karl started on him, talking weird stuff like how Erwin owes him money.<eos> Then Karl smacked him one.<eos> Now Erwin's doing Karl's shift at the Einfall.<eos> But what happened?<eos> Why did Karl do it?
My father used to say that.<eos> Why didn't Grant want to take part in the study?<eos> Grant?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Then why did you volunteer?<eos> They said that everyone who signed up would get a horse.<eos> A horse?<eos> Yes, a Døla horse.<eos> Dala horse.<eos> And you did.
- Why not?<eos> You're a bright, innocent, beautiful girl and I'm not gonna screw that up like everything else.<eos> Really?<eos> - What?<eos> - You think that?<eos> That I'm beautiful?<eos> No.<eos> Then why won't you?<eos> Because crime doesn't pay?<eos> No, it does. It does.
-Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> You come into my town, mess up my bar...<eos> -...and you eyeball my woman?<eos> -Eyeball your woman?<eos> It's on.<eos> What's this?<eos> Who is this?<eos> Is he your friend?<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Do you?
Come on!<eos> Pardon me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was in my own little world.<eos> -Is it important?<eos> -Very.<eos> -I hope it gets where it's supposed to go.<eos> -Me too.<eos> -These days you never know.<eos> -No, you never do. -Goodbye.
You always have my jewels up there to paint.<eos> She...<eos> You lock up at night, open it in the morning.<eos> There.<eos> Are you satisfied, Tanneke?<eos> Yes, mistress.<eos> Got it.<eos> I win again.<eos> No, we are drawing.<eos> - Well, I do.
Is it true she wore my pearls?<eos> How could you?<eos> How could you?<eos> Show me this painting.<eos> You'll make yourself ill.<eos> You show me.<eos> It's obscene.<eos> Why don't you paint me?<eos> Because you don't understand!<eos> And she does?
But you'd be disappointed.<eos> I only note unimportant things:<eos> what people say and do.<eos> Yeah, a Iot happens here, but it's nothing special.<eos> This place is full of missed opportunities.<eos> - Want some more?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Does my drinking surprise you?<eos> Men usually find it strange that women drink<eos> like men do.
- No. - I talked to the local paper.<eos> - I haven't read that.<eos> I say some excellent things.<eos> At least, that's what people tell me.<eos> - Why haven't you seen that?<eos> - I just haven't seen that.<eos> I get to see movies for free.<eos> And I can also go bowling.<eos> - But you don't know how to bowl.<eos> - Yes, I do.
After your father lost his job, I had to work so hard...<eos> Okay, just give it to me.<eos> Deliver it to Room 201, 202 in Chungwon Building.<eos> I got you another tutor job.<eos> If you give up on this one, I'm giving you up.<eos> Mom!<eos> Remember my rich friend I told you about?<eos> She wants you to teach her son for three months.<eos> All you have to do is making him study for two hours.<eos> Do your best.
Go on... tell her.<eos> Uncle Doug and I, we talk in our heads.<eos> You mean, you play with each other, as well?<eos> He loves it here.<eos> He built Rose Red.<eos> Did he tell you that, too?<eos> She said you built her, Mama.<eos> - Did she?<eos> -She says she loves Mama.<eos> As much as I do, maybe more.
It all started when we came to Seoul.<eos> So let's go back to Pusan!<eos> - Tae-il!<eos> - Come on!<eos> Let's go back to Pusan!<eos> What am I?<eos> A joke?<eos> You think you can just show up like this and cause all this ruckus and I'd go with you?<eos> Il-mae, I love you!<eos> I really do!
- Whatever it's called, just do it.<eos> You can do it.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You got it.<eos> You got it, Shane.<eos> Come on, Shane.<eos> I did it!<eos> I did it! I did it!
Oh.<eos> If it helps Elinor, Poirot, ask all you want.<eos> Merci.<eos> You returned home early from France, I believe.<eos> You were seen here on the day of the murder.<eos> Yes, all right, I did come back.<eos> I didn't want Elinor to know. You see, I'd decided to ask Mary to marry me.<eos> And you saw her?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Get ahold of CTU.<eos> I want a list of every mosque in a 15-mile radius. - Mosques?<eos> - They talked about prayer before Ali left.<eos> - The time fits.<eos> - Roger that.<eos> - Did that help?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I think it did.<eos> OK. Kate, the normal protocol would be to transfer you back to CTU for further debriefing.<eos> But the truth is, I don't know what Syed Ali looks like.<eos> No one does, except for you.
We're looking for a green van.<eos> The nuke may be inside. - Send a team down to the Arco.<eos> - When is the bomb set to go off? - Three hours.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I saw the timer.<eos> - Describe it.<eos> - What?<eos> - The timer.<eos> Describe it.<eos> I don't...
Right.<eos> I need some information.<eos> - I can't help you.<eos> - Five minutes.<eos> - All I need is a location.<eos> - He said no. It can mean the end of Sloane.<eos> Sloane's with Ahmad Kabir.<eos> I need to know where Kabir operates.<eos> They need to be stopped.<eos> Not by my husband, they don't.
I know it's hard, but this isn't about you.<eos> And I will not allow my daughter to become your mistress.<eos> If that's where you think my concern for Sydney is headed, you are more cynical than I thought.<eos> If lightning strikes and you and I get to walk free again, if you care about my daughter as you claim to, then push her away.<eos> Be cruel if you have to.<eos> Make her despise you. Because your kindness tortures her.<eos> I can see it, what it does to her.<eos> And I won't have it.<eos> You and Vaughn's wife work together?<eos> - Okay, how the hell did that --
What did Kendall say?<eos> He told me about your father.<eos> He didn't mention anything about our date, if that's what you mean.<eos> - Have you written your debrief?<eos> - No, not yet.<eos> If I tell the truth, at the least, they'll remove me as your case officer.<eos> But despite what we did, how stupid we were, I know we do good work.<eos> We need to stay together.<eos> I agree.<eos> We do good work.
I want her back in this office alive.<eos> Volkov has a meeting scheduled for tomorrow night in Prague.<eos> I have the address.<eos> He's supposed to be delivering something.<eos> What it is, I do not know.<eos> Perhaps it is your thing.<eos> Do you know what he drives?<eos> A sedan, armoured, of course, with a protective detail.<eos> Sydney, if you want to stop that car, you will need backup.<eos> No, I don't.
You headed out?<eos> - Hey, no tears, big guy.<eos> - No, I'm good.<eos> I wish I could've seen you kicking the crap out of Junior.<eos> It was pretty funny. [GUNN CHUCKLING]<eos> FAITH: Wes...<eos> Faith.<eos> See? Brits know how to say goodbye.<eos> Angel here wanted to hug.<eos> No, I didn't.
- So what?<eos> - It's my bone.<eos> Just drop it.<eos> I wasn't proposing.<eos> Time goes by, a girl gets hungry.<eos> - Oh, thank God.<eos> - What?<eos> - Demon. - Huh?<eos> - D'Hoffryn says you die.<eos> - Of course he does.
Same reason you knew I'd be waiting here.<eos> - I mean, this is still our spot, isn't it?<eos> - No.<eos> This is what we hoped it would be.<eos> This is what we were trying to preserve for our future.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> We were naive to think we could change anything.<eos> - To stop him.<eos> - You don't believe that.<eos> - Or at least you didn't.
A demon killed him right in front of me.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - At your temp job?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I should have seen it coming.<eos> Every other job, someone's wound up needing my help.<eos> - I just don't know why I didn't see it.<eos> - Well, maybe you weren't meant to.<eos> No, I was.<eos> I just... I didn't.
Every other job, someone's wound up needing my help.<eos> - I just don't know why I didn't see it.<eos> - Well, maybe you weren't meant to.<eos> No, I was.<eos> I just... I didn't.<eos> Even worse, when I tried to save him, he wound up saving me.<eos> I just wish I knew what was going on.<eos> Why they were after Larry in the first place and how he knew they were coming for him.<eos> - What do you mean, he knew?<eos> - He just did.
Get the fuck outta here!<eos> You think you can show up here and pull this kind of shit?<eos> Know what it's like to lose a daughter?<eos> Get your skanky ass outta here!<eos> That's right!<eos> You run, bitch!<eos> Run!<eos> Thanks.<eos> Are you gonna tell him?<eos> If you don't.
Go to your room.<eos> I got some referrals for a child psychologist.<eos> I'll interview people on Monday.<eos> - She doesn't need therapy.<eos> Life is like an assembly line.<eos> First you have the great idea, the master plan.<eos> You make the prototype and you start mass producing.<eos> Billions and billions.<eos> They don't last forever.<eos> Nothing does.
Wow.<eos> Wow, what?<eos> I was riding right alongside Hopalong Cassidy... chasing some bad guys.<eos> I was with Lisa again... except this time we were snow-sailing in New Zealand.<eos> Then I was 8 years old, maybe nine... picking up leaves with my dad.<eos> But it wasn't a dream, Captain.<eos> It was as real as I'm sitting here.<eos> They told me you can try it... anyone on the crew.<eos> Who told you?<eos> They did.
- Hey, Joe?<eos> I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.<eos> Bad news.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> - But you watched the tape?<eos> - Yeah, I liked it.<eos> But my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches.<eos> - You didn't watch the tape.<eos> - What?<eos> Of course I did.
But my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches.<eos> - You didn't watch the tape.<eos> - What?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?<eos> - I'm not lying to you. I watched it.<eos> - You lied again.<eos> - I watched it.<eos> - keep going, Pinocchio.<eos> - I did.
What's up, Jimmy?<eos> - You just showed up here, man.<eos> - I know I did. No call, no letter, just like...<eos> Just like you showed up in Stars Hollow with no letter, no call.<eos> - Were you in trouble?<eos> - We're not talking about me, we're talking about you.<eos> - I'm not running from the cops.<eos> - Then why are you here? Why'd you come to Stars Hollow?<eos> Hey, listen, Mr. Double-Talk, I need an answer here.<eos> Well, so do I.
To go to the source.<eos> Yup. I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I would've doubted me, too.<eos> - I need to trust you as much as I trusted... - Him.<eos> This black eye screwed everything up.<eos> Next time I go to your grandmother's, I'll try not to have one.<eos> - Next time? - Next time.<eos> So what happened?<eos> - I don't...
- I'm actually going on a date.<eos> - You are? - Your first college date.<eos> - Who's the lucky guy?<eos> - Just a guy from my English class.<eos> - No. Your English class?<eos> What happened?<eos> I thought you turned him down.<eos> - You turned him down?<eos> - I thought about it, and I reconsidered.<eos> - What did you do?
Wait a second.<eos> OK, that's not plum sauce. That's jelly from yesterday. That stays.<eos> Answering machine! What about it?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The light's not flashing anymore. Carrie's gonna know I checked the message.<eos> And we're back at the opera.<eos> No, no, no, no, no! Deac, call me on your cell phone. Leave a message.<eos> The light will flash again and both messages will play as new. I don't want to get in the middle of this.<eos> I'm kind of fond of this area.<eos> Fine, then, Danny, you do it.
- What would you say?<eos> -"Things get worse."<eos> - Mixed vegetables or mac-cheese?<eos> - Can I have both? Can I have neither?<eos> If I don't get at least a 1550, my dad is gonna kill me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Uh,<eos> - Yeah. Uh, by any chance, were you in, uh, Mr. Philby's room?<eos> - Yeah. So when Miss Landow died, you heard the car alarm go off?<eos> Everybody did.
are you gonna tell me that was a plant, too?<eos> It had to be.<eos> I'm not guilty, sir.<eos> They're always so sincere when they say that.<eos> What if I was to give you an offer to prove that?<eos> Anything, sir.<eos> You'd be willing to give us a sample of your DNA?<eos> Someone put that box in my locker and that key on my keychain.<eos> How do I know that you don't have my DNA on something else they planted, too?<eos> You don't.
Did you know him?<eos> Only to say hello.<eos> He worked with the interrogator Paula Cassidy.<eos> You might want to think about keeping that door shut.<eos> Iguanas have been known to wander inside.<eos> Nasser arrived in June from Afghanistan.<eos> Yes.<eos> Insists he was picked up by mistake.<eos> Weren't they all?<eos> Agent Cassidy did especially well with the subject.
Oh. That might help.<eos> Whoa, we've got nothin' like this at Pearl.<eos> This is where the big boys play. Dinozzo!<eos> Speaking of big boys.<eos> Yeah, boss?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Ah, well, my flight's not till 9 in the morning.<eos> Since I'm here I thought that, maybe...<eos> You know how to do a database search? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
No temperature.<eos> I think it's a stomach virus.<eos> I know it is.<eos> Did you use that thermometer on cadavers?<eos> Would you rather I used a liver probe?<eos> Why are you so sure it was the flu?<eos> It's the same symptoms major Kerry had.<eos> Did you work together recently?<eos> No.<eos> Well, if you didn't workwith him, then how?
She'll be here in three seconds.<eos> One, two...<eos> Two and a half.<eos> Oh, Aggie, I'm so sorry!<eos> Please tell me that you got the message.<eos> - What message?<eos> - I called, told some guy who answered the phone that the sitter was late.<eos> He promised to pass it along.<eos> Promises don't mean a whole hell of a lot in Oz.<eos> Well mine certainly does.
- Baby, you don't wanna do this.<eos> - What?<eos> Since your mother passed, you've been feeling lonely and like you don't have any family.<eos> I'm your family now, whether we do it like this or we wait and do it like you've always wanted to.<eos> Holy cow, talk about your gigantic time wasters.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Lighten up, slut!<eos> What now?<eos> I think relationships can be defined by big moments that don't happen.<eos> Or by the little ones that do.
A little cranky when he woke up.<eos> - That was funny, the other day.<eos> - Yeah. It was fun.<eos> Wait, did you say it was fun or funny?<eos> I said funny, I think.<eos> But I guess I meant fun.<eos> Debbie seems really nice.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think so.<eos> So, does Robert...
- Detain, my ass. You're a goddamn kidnapper.<eos> - I'm a consultant.<eos> The kidnappers demand a ransom.<eos> The families hire me to broker the deal, get their loved ones back safely.<eos> - And you do this out of the goodness of your heart?<eos> - I charge a commission.<eos> I have a 100% recovery rate.<eos> - 'Cause your buddies are the ones doing the kidnapping.<eos> - No. Because I understand how to negotiate with these people.<eos> The Salvadoreans do not.
- You found the lab.<eos> After we got your call, we went and checked it out.<eos> David Copperfield must've got there first.<eos> I saw them.<eos> The people who took everything away?<eos> The sleeping girls.<eos> Why are they like me?<eos> - My daddy said I can't remember because I had an accident.<eos> You don't remember anything because you didn't write that.<eos> A different Emily did.
I know you ain't been getting hours, it's been slow.<eos> Five days last month.<eos> -That's all.<eos> -Is that all?<eos> Look, I got to shit or get off the pot here.<eos> -I'm gonna go with 47.<eos> -Do me a favor.<eos> Frank, you been fair, I ain't saying otherwise.<eos> It's just there's 60 checkers above me with more seniority, and that's all she wrote.<eos> Do me a favor.
- We checked the tiles for scuff marks.<eos> This ledge is 28 inches.<eos> I mean, even if she tripped, it's pretty hard just to fall over.<eos> Did you interview Clare that day?<eos> She was playing in the family room, heard a thump... came out to see what it was.<eos> Her father was raking leaves in the front.<eos> He got there a few moments later.<eos> - That's what he said.<eos> - You suspect something else?<eos> Did you?
Certainly not for acute anxiety.<eos> - Anxiety?<eos> - Her parents didn't tell you?<eos> - Tell us what?<eos> - That's what I was afraid of.<eos> She came in about a week-and-a-half ago with her boyfriend.<eos> It feels like it's beating out of my chest, and I can't catch my breath all the time.<eos> I can tell you there's nothing wrong with your heart, Natasha.<eos> - What you're describing is a panic attack.<eos> - So what do I do about it?
Everything about this country inspires him.<eos> Two loose eggs, hot cinnamon bun, two black coffees.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you guys ready?<eos> Well, I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but you were better than your husband.<eos> You weren't upset about that, were you?<eos> I mean, he...<eos> he said you wouldn't be.<eos> He did, did he?
I pummel you good!<eos> Yes, I'm sure you will, but before you do...<eos> I have one more question.<eos> Is this yours?<eos> Yes!<eos> Morph, we are so out of here!<eos> Jimbo! Aren't you the seventh wonder of the universe?<eos> Get back!<eos> I like you, lad, but I've come too far... to let you stand between me and me treasure.<eos> Oh, no, you don't!
- Mr President.<eos> You must be the Dr Ryan who's done such interesting research on me.<eos> You should not be surprised.<eos> We know quite a bit.<eos> We know how wrong your report was that I had many girlfriends in college.<eos> I met my wife in my third year and have not looked at another woman since.<eos> I was referring to the first two years... sir.<eos> Where you received highest honors in English.<eos> I like him.<eos> Well, in that case, so do I.
He calls here and tells Lara, who cries.<eos> He still runs across the university and in the stadium, where John watches.<eos> Oh, God. He's running so fast, just like his daddy.<eos> He sees his daddy.<eos> He wants to run to him.<eos> But he's only 6 years old, and he can't do it.<eos> And the other man is so fast.<eos> There was so much love in this house.<eos> I want him back so bad.<eos> So did she.
-Ten.<eos> How...?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> -What's wrongwith her?<eos> -She looked awful.<eos> No she didn't, I liked her.<eos> Didyou see the way she looked at me?<eos> She wanted me.<eos> You're dreaming.<eos> She did!
Ma, you in there?<eos> You in there?<eos> Can you see this?<eos> Will you just lay off her?<eos> -You are such a loser.<eos> -Oh, I'm a loser?<eos> Yeah, you're a loser.<eos> You've always been a loser.<eos> You think I'm some small-time jerk-off?<eos> -Yeah, I do.
CHRIS: Are you in on the basketball pool?<eos> -What's the line on that game?<eos> -I'll ask the Bagel Guy when he gets here.<eos> -What's the Bagel Guy have to do with this?<eos> -Bagel Guy knows everything.<eos> Dude's incredible.<eos> Why can't he get here on time with the bagels?<eos> It's just been one of those days.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> MATT: Yes, I do.
They're just soldiers.<eos> They were following my orders.<eos> I assume complete responsibility.<eos> That's very noble of you.<eos> Seems you've won our duel aRer all, Colonel.<eos> No.<eos> We both lose, don't we?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And now you wish to trade your life for theirs?<eos> Yes, I do.
- So they crammed 200 soldiers...<eos> - We know the story, Daddy.<eos> into that tiny social hall, and the first person to walk on stage is your mother and she starts to dance.<eos> You know, it had been months since we'd seen a woman, and here's this blond angel.<eos> Blond bombshell.<eos> And the men are literally holding their breath.<eos> Holding their breath for you. Hear that?<eos> I turned to my buddies and I said...<eos> I will not leave France without her.<eos> And I didn't.

Mystery Inc, this ain't over!<eos> Not by a long shot!<eos> I'll rock you and sock you and crush you like...<eos> Like, dude.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're a bad puppy!<eos> I can still take you! Put them up, you mangy mutt!<eos> Is that all you got?<eos> Hey, Daph!<eos> - We did it!
-What's going on?<eos> Look, I've been thinking.<eos> I'm thinking about scoring.<eos> -l'm sorry I took your money.<eos> -Forget the money.<eos> Let me come get you.<eos> I'm gonna go away for a while, okay?<eos> Don't do this, you'll regret it.<eos> A kid needs his mother.<eos> -Don't do this.
- Terrific.<eos> - So you're going tonight?<eos> - Yes. - Cool.<eos> - You're going? Yes.<eos> I came by to talk to you about something in particular.<eos> There's this friend of mine who's really cute, and I want you to meet her.<eos> I was thinking about bringing her tonight.<eos> Yeah, I don't wanna do that.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I just don't do stuff like that.
No<eos> Turn the light off<eos> Turn them off<eos> You can save him<eos> - Please, Mom<eos> - I don't understand You're a liar<eos> Turn it off<eos> You're not my mother<eos> Turn them off<eos> Do it for Dad
No, I'm sorry.<eos> It's suicide.<eos> I mean, they'll crucify you.<eos> Mum's at it again.<eos> - At what?<eos> Sorry.<eos> - What do you mean, what?<eos> The crying.<eos> She sits in the house all day, crying.<eos> She does it in the mornings, too.
What's "tainted"?<eos> Is that like "painted"?<eos> -Gin, I said tomorrow, okay?<eos> -Not exactly the Biltmore, is it?<eos> It's the information age, sweetheart.<eos> You leave a trail everywhere.<eos> Especially when your best friend rents your room with her credit card.<eos> I had to do that since someone froze all my accounts, right?<eos> -We need to talk.<eos> -No, we don't.
I'll see you back there!<eos> Yes, I was. In what regard were you her familiar?<eos> - You're welcome. How did you know her, Finch?<eos> She was an avid reader of my novels.<eos> When did you first meet?<eos> About a year ago.<eos> She came to a signing here in Nightmute.<eos> She hung around afterwards and we chatted about my writing and how she wanted to write.<eos> Then we started talking and she asked if she could visit and talk about books.<eos> - And she did?
If it were always a good idea... it wouldn't be unconventional.<eos> You're going to do fine.<eos> You have a lot of color... in your face.<eos> Have you been out in the sun today?<eos> Yeah, Hannah.<eos> Ginger, Ginger.<eos> Relax your throat when you're eating.<eos> Yeah, Ginger.<eos> Mm-hmm? You knew my wife before I did...<eos> Actually, before all of us did.
Are you gonna go visit Clay Gephardt?<eos> That would be a no.<eos> They moved him from the hospital to a rehab place.<eos> Is this your idea of small talk?<eos> If so, your social skills need work. No one made him jump.<eos> - It's called peer pressure.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> You read it in your precious book?<eos> Please don't pretend like you know me, okay?<eos> But I do. I do.
So you were following our conversation?<eos> No, I left immediately, and I took the serving tray. Pierrette, what did you do after that?<eos> We talked some more, then I left.<eos> I can confirm that. I saw her through the kitchen window.<eos> Did she say anything else?<eos> I'll tell you if you'll leave me alone.<eos> She asked me to keep quiet and she gave me 10.000 francs.<eos> Which I regret, little bimbo. -What?<eos> You sleep with everyone don't you.<eos> -You don't? Even with the same ones.
Why?<eos> A person's home is supposedly the mirror of their soul.<eos> We will probably have to question you in the next few days.<eos> Where can we reach you?<eos> I'll give you the number of my gallery.<eos> That should be enough.<eos> Do you have a pen?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Somebody will pay for this.<eos> Somebody always does.
- Everyone in?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> The rules are easy.<eos> You get one card.<eos> Don't let anyone look.<eos> You answer "yes" or "no" to the question on it.<eos> How do we know who answers what?<eos> We don't.
Come over here.<eos> I'm going to tell you a little secret.<eos> I've had this job for 12 years.<eos> And I still haven't shot anyone. -Really?<eos> -Really.<eos> I've drawn my pistol many times, but I've never had to shoot.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> But you did save Uncle Jose's life once.<eos> -Who told you that?<eos> -He did.
Sorry about that.<eos> That guy snuck into the hospital and took those pictures of me.<eos> Remember? With the tubes hanging out of me?<eos> Forget that prick.<eos> Give yourself some credit.<eos> When we catch the Tooth Fairy... that print plus his teeth will burn him.<eos> You did that, Will.<eos> That evidence was there, Jack.<eos> - It was there for anyone to see.<eos> - But nobody else did.
"Why didn't I become a cowboy?"<eos> Something else happened when you were 12 that was very difficult for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's when your father was murdered.<eos> - Yeah, I think about it every day. - Uh-huh.<eos> - What's that got to do with anything?<eos> - It has a lot to do with things.<eos> It's very interesting because your father was the one who got you the white hat.<eos> He was in the Mob, but yet he wanted you to be a hero.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Sauer... sauerkraut or sauercrop?<eos> Sauerkraut?<eos> Hey... hey, hey! Hey!<eos> I just washed that car.<eos> What the hell wrong with you, boy?<eos> Want I jam this in your ass and break it?<eos> You want a go? Come down here.<eos> Whoa, wait, wait, oh. Not too fast, not too fast.<eos> Hey, I just want to talk.<eos> Eh, eh, you do that there, man.
- Right. What do you know, fuckass teacher?<eos> I know about human stupidity.<eos> Which one?<eos> Huh? That hooker there.<eos> Donna!<eos> Get off my back! Look at me, Marcus.<eos> - You know Guillermo Nuñez?<eos> - No. - You don't know him?<eos> - No. You know who does?<eos> Nobody does.
Get this off of me!<eos> - Help!<eos> - Jesus, no!<eos> - Please, Stewie, get me out of here!<eos> Help us!<eos> Stewie, it's freezing.<eos> Help me, baby. I'm going down!<eos> Help us, anybody!<eos> Oh, God, no!<eos> Don't you do this to me!
What were you doing down there then?<eos> Me?<eos> I was... I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.<eos> They're ruining all the school cabbages.<eos> Harry.<eos> Hagrid.<eos> Hello, Hermione.<eos> - It's so good to see you.<eos> - It's great to see you too.<eos> What did you do to your glasses?
Our ancestor Paikea.<eos> But now we were waiting for the firstborn of the new generation. For the descendant of the whale rider.<eos> For the boy who would be chief.<eos> Paikea.<eos> There was no gladness when I was born.<eos> My twin brother died and took our mother with him.<eos> Rawiri.<eos> Everyone was waiting for the firstborn boy to lead us.<eos> But he died.<eos> And I didn't.
- Yes. I had an interview at Columbia, so Mom said I should look you up.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - Okay.<eos> That's what all the phone calls were about.<eos> - The phone calls?<eos> - Yeah. Your mom's been calling me.<eos> - Did you speak to her?<eos> - We're playing phone tag.<eos> She said you could show me what you do here.<eos> She did?
Seriously...<eos> Don't talk like that... it's stupid.<eos> You know what?<eos> I did think of jumping.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Why?<eos> - 'Cause all of this is bullshit.<eos> I don't want to live anymore.<eos> Yeah, you do!
It's awful.<eos> And cigarettes, please.<eos> That'll be 160,40.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Close your eyes.<eos> - What?<eos> Close your eyes. - What for?<eos> - Please, close your eyes.<eos> - What you going to do?<eos> - Nothing special, just do it.
- Beer?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You should've told me before we came in here.<eos> It would liven things up.<eos> We just scored a big one.<eos> Damn it. Look at this asshole.<eos> Your hair's wet.<eos> Sharing the same room?<eos> I just did what I was told.<eos> Did it with Soo-jin or not?
Go now.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Is your mother home?<eos> You were always lousy at flattery.<eos> - Did you wait for me? - For years.<eos> Forgive me for asking, but did we fight a lot?<eos> You really don't remember much, do you?<eos> Not a thing.<eos> We did.
And how do you do that?<eos> You know.<eos> Open doors for her and stuff.<eos> Yeah? And fuck her really hard?<eos> Is that how you treat a lady?<eos> That's no way for a lady to talk.<eos> What are you doing with these two, Simona?<eos> Let's talk about something else, shall we?<eos> That really disgusts me.<eos> What does?
It was nothing compared to what she called me yesterday.<eos> I am just tired. I've been at work.<eos> - What did she call you?<eos> - An East German dyke.<eos> I was proud of her.<eos> They're doing the Cold War at school now.<eos> Stine will have to pay for that plate, won't she?<eos> Joachim?<eos> Remember this?<eos> Do you?
I followed your advice.<eos> Hey, presto?<eos> No need for it to drag out as it did with you.<eos> It can be simple.<eos> No, it can't.<eos> - Yes, it can.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I know you.<eos> You do?
- What about my fish?<eos> - Hurry it up, kid!<eos> - I don't want to lose my fish! - Forget your fish.<eos> - Sit your ass down.<eos> - My father will kill me.<eos> - That doesn't matter.<eos> Let's go.<eos> There's nothing here. That day, my father swore he never wanted to see my brother again.<eos> Let's go, Felipe.<eos> And he never did.
This is a hold-up!<eos> - The first time...<eos> - Where are the revolvers?<eos> Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk from being shot by Carrot.<eos> We said no killing!<eos> That's the rule.<eos> We want the boss' money.<eos> Everyone keep calm.<eos> Open the cash register! You want us to go?<eos> We do too.
Let's go!<eos> Run!<eos> Run!<eos> Watch out!<eos> Blast him!<eos> Knockout Ned!<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Don't move.<eos> It hurts, man.<eos> Easy does it, kid.
So I see.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> What about?<eos> Later, all right?<eos> -So long.<eos> -'Bye.<eos> She wants to talk.<eos> That's good, right?<eos> You wanted to talk too.<eos> No, you did.
- She flirted both of us.<eos> - But he dated her first.<eos> And that makes her his property?<eos> Come on! We met, we flirted, we made out. That 's it.<eos> "That 's it" for you, who deflowered her and all.<eos> - But he really liked her!<eos> - Me too!<eos> So much that you already dumped her.<eos> She didn't want me anymore. If she did...<eos> She didn't?
You said her heart wasn't beating!<eos> L was wrong!<eos> But now...<eos> - You banged her head!<eos> - But you set her on fire!<eos> You killed her, not the fire!<eos> L'm not guilty!<eos> L finished what was already done!<eos> - You're guilty!<eos> - Just because I did it, right?
A fight?<eos> And what happened?<eos> wood against steel<eos> Sir Twilight went bang! Knocked him senseless<eos> He did?<eos> I always thought he was strange<eos> I never thought he was a fighter, though<eos> Maybe we shouldn't be calling him 'Sir Twilight'<eos> You think he knows?<eos> Sure he does
You feel uncomfortable, but not because you're ready to be with my husband.<eos> You feel uncomfortable because you're doing it with my knowledge and consent.<eos> Why are you doing this, Mrs Palmer?<eos> It's... It's important for David's career that I have his full confidence.<eos> And I no longer have that.<eos> And you want me to get it?<eos> Yes.<eos> And report back to me.<eos> - We both know what it's going to...?<eos> - Yes. We do.
- Of course you can do it.<eos> No, I'm just a programmer and I don't think I work very well under this kind of pressure, so maybe they just wanna bring somebody else in.<eos> Look, Paula, there is no one else.<eos> You're the best at what you do. You know the system inside out.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> Just take it one task at a time.<eos> Right now all I need you to do is open up a couple of sockets.<eos> And then get to the conference room, all right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hi, Tony. How you doing?
Department of Special Research.<eos> Because her picture was in a manuscript?<eos> - That's special access only.<eos> - I'm her case officer.<eos> The loop is closed.<eos> Orders from the DCI.<eos> I don't care.<eos> If the NSA know something, I should, too.<eos> We should, sir.<eos> Unless you already do.
... Kendall,I thinkwe should plead this out.<eos> Richard is sure we can win.<eos> How could the jury not think he was crazy?<eos> He thought his wife was a soccer ball.<eos> I used to be a lawyer.<eos> Two years, and I quit.<eos> And now you sing?<eos> Yeah, TV jingles.<eos> I was a blues singer for about six years and could not make my rent.<eos> On New Year's Eve, I did these jingles as a lark.
She dated him just for kicks.<eos> That's what she said.<eos> As she became interested, she asked herself the usual questions:<eos> "Does he make a good living?<eos> Does he want children?<eos> Will he be a good father?"<eos> She neglected to ask herself...<eos> ... " Willheconfusemyhead for a soccer ball?"<eos> 'Cause that could never happen.<eos> But it did.
-You know, Ally... ... nomatterhowlow Isetthebar of common sense, you slither under it.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Why did you buy this house? Really?<eos> Well, my therapist thinks that I see this house... ... assomethingthatneeds to be worked on forever... ... becausethat'stheway I see myself.<eos> Do you think that's true?<eos> I bought it because it's beautiful... ... andit'ssomethingIcancommitto.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I also, I admit, find some joy in the fact that I was able to buy it... ... youknow,withmoneyImade, you know, that I earned.<eos> I didn't need a husband to take that step, and I didn't need his income.<eos> I did it.
-I didn't want it to be like this.<eos> He didn't want it to be like this.<eos> He didn't think we were gonna win.<eos> We probably weren't.<eos> Are you gonna do it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think you should.<eos> Look, I've been blinded by my hatred for... .<eos> Your mother would have wanted this.<eos> And so do I.
I just seem to keep missing the point here, don't I?<eos> (SCREAMS]<eos> Why don't we just set up a fail-safe, and you check with me on things first.<eos> Would that apply to vomit?<eos> Because I'm about to puke.<eos> Yes, it would apply to vomit.<eos> I didn't send for a plumber.<eos> Look, Maddie, it isn't very interesting, okay?<eos> You're testing her because you're not convinced she wants you.<eos> Well, she does.
I just feel sort of creepy.<eos> - Keeping him distracted while Angel...<eos> - Confronts the kidnapper?<eos> Well, if you're gonna put it like that...<eos> - What do you think he'll do?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I know what I'd do, but Angel will deal with Holtz in his own way.<eos> GUNN: No way.<eos> He couldn't have heard us.<eos> He did.
It is come. The champion has come.<eos> Come for what?<eos> Answers not to be had.<eos> Death is certain.<eos> Death awaits.<eos> - I wanna talk to the Conduit.<eos> - We are the Conduit.<eos> The gateway, the all-times, the ever.<eos> It wishes to speak to us.<eos> Yes, it does.
Well, it's not rising up till sometime later today.<eos> Why can't you have sex?<eos> - I could lose my vision-ity.<eos> - If you want to play it that way.<eos> - Vision-ity.<eos> The visions.<eos> When that one hit me last night, it hit me.<eos> In Pylea the visions were to pass to Groo if we did the com-shuk.<eos> - How do I know that won't happen here?<eos> - You don't.
NARRATOR:<eos> Previously on Angel: - I sort of need to talk to you.<eos> - I'm late, I'm late.<eos> - Connor.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> [GRUNTING] What you're being called to do transcends love.<eos> - You've become a higher being.<eos> - Me? I know somehow it's all gonna be all right.<eos> - You murdered my father.<eos> - I didn't.
But you need more than just muscle right now.<eos> You're right.<eos> I need someone who won't lie to me, like you did.<eos> All of you, I know you were trying to help.<eos> But the truth is the only way to do that.<eos> And that's what Connor's given to me.<eos> Keep her safe.<eos> If it makes you feel better, I would have chosen you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But no, it doesn't.
Angel!<eos> MAN: Blackjack.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - I'm feeling really bad about this.<eos> - Well, don't feel guilty, babe.<eos> If I had your head for numbers, I'd be counting cards.<eos> No. I mean about Lorne acting weird with us.<eos> The guy's on some old star trip, man.<eos> Who needs him?<eos> Angel does.
Your friends will be dead so quick they won't feel a thing.<eos> CORDELIA: Oh, that's just great.<eos> What's the point of being an all-seeing, powerful whatchamawhosit if I'm not allowed to intervene?<eos> My friends are gonna die.<eos> I mean, what am I supposed to...?<eos> Angel.<eos> God, look what they've done to you.<eos> If I could just get you in that room, maybe...<eos> Oh, think, bubblehead.<eos> How do I...?
I know what's happening.<eos> Count Kurskov he's punishing you.<eos> He made me.<eos> He owns me.<eos> When I dance, it's only for him.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> It really doesn't matter.<eos> I'll dance, I'll wait here and then I'll dance again.<eos> That's all.<eos> A hundred years, doing the same piece every night.
I didn't know what they were.<eos> I got saved, quit the Corps, joined the squad.<eos> My first fire fight, I met Riley.<eos> We started talking. First about tactics, missions, stuff like that.<eos> And then about you.<eos> He thinks I let him go.<eos> Do you wish you hadn't?<eos> I wish things were different.<eos> I'm not trying to...<eos> I don't...
- I killed her.<eos> - It was an accident.<eos> It just happened.<eos> - Nothing just happens.<eos> You are not going in there.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> Just let me go.<eos> I can't.<eos> I love you.<eos> No, you don't.
Seems like someone's got quite a coin collection, huh?<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> You have locker number 281?<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> I want you to tell me what this is, and what this has to do with Cassie Newton.<eos> - l don't know. lt's late. I'll miss my bus.<eos> - l know it's late. That's why I don't have time to mess around.<eos> So you need to talk to me.<eos> Now. Believe me, if I knew anything, I'd tell you.<eos> I just don't.
- Yes, please.<eos> - Spike.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Willow mentioned the shindig.<eos> Figured we were all part of the team. Thought I'd swing by.<eos> - Wait. What kind of team is this?<eos> - Hi.<eos> We met once before.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we did.
Honey, sweets, toots? I appreciate that you're very concerned, but I am still a witch, and we do still have innocents to protect and demons to fight.<eos> I can't just crawl in a hole.<eos> It's too bad, Mylie, but your time is up.<eos> You had 30 days to find love or the penalty would be death.<eos> But he does love me.<eos> I know he does.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Did he tell you?<eos> He doesn't have to tell me he loves me.<eos> Well, actually, he does.
Shocking and unexpected.<eos> I'm a friend of Mylie's.<eos> She sent me here because she needs to speak with you.<eos> Why didn't she come herself?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> There's a good answer, I just can't tell you what it is.<eos> But it's good.<eos> Let me get this straight. You're a friend of Mylie's.<eos> I've never met you, never even heard of you, and you know more about her than I do?<eos> No, not more about her than you do, just a little secret.
I appreciate your intervening before I got any further... with Mr Mayweather's procedure.<eos> I wasn't certain it would work on a Denobulan.<eos> It worked quite effectively, I can assure you.<eos> What procedure on Mr Mayweather?<eos> The radiation affected my nervous system rather severely.<eos> - I'll be with you in a moment.<eos> - Okay, Doctor.<eos> I'll provide you with a full report when I've finished treating the crew.<eos> - You wanted to see me, Captain?<eos> - I did.
I've done it before.<eos> I've got friends who help.<eos> I'll probably end up in an even better job.<eos> You're a frelling optimist.<eos> Hard to be a revoluntionary if you're not.<eos> Now, really.<eos> I should go powder my face.<eos> - I think you look beautiful just as you are.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
My name's...<eos> Raa'Keel.<eos> And mine is Uta-Noranti-Pralatong.<eos> I'm afraid there's been a huge misunderstanding which we really must rectify.<eos> A misunderstanding?<eos> Yeah, we really shouldn't be shooting each other.<eos> We didn't come here to rob you guys.<eos> Hell, we didn't know there was anybody on this rock.<eos> We're not your enemies, we know who you are.<eos> - You do?
She did all the work, you know.<eos> And she'll continue to do so, thanks to you.<eos> You know what I wish?<eos> I wish I could just see whoever's going to get her, you know?<eos> Well, Miguel... you're going to get your wish, 'cause that person will be here in just a second.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - McManus has been working the phones...<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I thought he didn't want her.<eos> Tina didn't.
Brother Lalar is new to the fold.<eos> Scold him, take away his food, but don't cast him out.<eos> You're sitting down?<eos> You'll sit down?<eos> Did I tell you to sit down!<eos> You cannot sit down!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Did I tell you you can sit down!<eos> Did I?
But that's part of the fun.<eos> And a New York museum, like a man, can sometimes be closed when you wish they were open.<eos> That's another reason I love New York.<eos> Just like that, it can go from bad to cute.<eos> Well, I guess we're not going anywhere for a while.<eos> I love the way the rain smells.<eos> If this were a French movie, we'd fall in love and get married.<eos> No, I was just pointing out how romantic this would be in a movie.<eos> I don't want to marry you.<eos> OK, I do!
If you want out of this, say it.<eos> - I don't want sex and I want out?<eos> - What about yesterday?<eos> - We were at the opera.<eos> - I was bored.<eos> I fucked you for three hours when we came home.<eos> Why haven't you hung the hearts?<eos> It's been laying there for days.<eos> - I'm not sure it belongs here.<eos> - Or I don't?
Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It was kind of amazing.<eos> Why did I need a stranger to remind me?<eos> - Where can I take you?<eos> - Home, 73rd and...<eos> No.<eos> We have to celebrate this.<eos> - l want to tell him.<eos> - Oh no, I don't...
This is my editor.<eos> - This is Gabe Manning.<eos> - Hi, I'm Charlotte.<eos> I'm glad I ran into you since you don't return your calls.<eos> I know. But I am just now researching my next column.<eos> I think it's going to be super fun and sexy.<eos> We sit here and pick how many men out of 100 we would sleep with.<eos> No one's asking to fuck every guy.<eos> We're a weekly paper.<eos> - No, we don't actually...
She has a message for you.<eos> There's an innocent woman and an innocent kid in danger out there and you're not telling me the truth!<eos> - Yes, I am!<eos> Someone's holding a gun to their heads right now and you're stopping me from finding them.<eos> I'm not.<eos> You might as well be pulling the trigger.<eos> Tell me the truth!<eos> - I am!<eos> - He doesn't know anything.<eos> Yes, he does.
I spent every Saturday of my childhood here, eighth row center.<eos> When the lights went down and the screen flickered on... the problems outside these doors just disappeared.<eos> It was like being transported to a magical place.<eos> That's a nice story, but why is it so important to you really?<eos> My parents met here.<eos> I guess I'm just looking for something to hold on to.<eos> I'm supposed to preserve this monument to Lana Lang's sentimental memories.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> You're a teenager, Lana.<eos> Mercurial doesn't do you justice.
I think... they're perfect for each other.<eos> [Upbeat instrumental music]<eos> I just wanted to let you know... that it killed me that I forgot your birthday.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I have another one next year.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not being fair to you.<eos> I mean, this was your special day and you're buying me presents?<eos> Did you not like the socks?<eos> Of course I did.
An unfortunate inheritance for you, because I will find them... if I have to dig them out.<eos> You're telling me Kanan was compelled to rescue a slave he met months ago?<eos> As a result of blending with Colonel O'Neill, yes.<eos> Based on the arrogant notion O'Neill would never have left her behind.<eos> Sir, I know from experience how deeply the emotions can be shared<eos> - between a Tok'ra symbiote and its host. - So do I, Major Carter.<eos> Still, your theory seems to be based on just intuition.<eos> I won't argue with that, but it's not without reasoning.<eos> - I know that's where Colonel O'Neill is.<eos> - As do I.
Close the blast doors.<eos> Prepare to launch.<eos> Prepare to launch.<eos> - Target Sierra-1 has been acquired.<eos> - Sergeant, launch when ready.<eos> Missile away.<eos> Sierra-1 destroyed.<eos> Attempting to acquire Sierra-2.<eos> How do you know those are the only emplacements guarding the gate?<eos> - We don't.
And you've seen this thing working?<eos> Oh, yes. As a child.<eos> An enemy of our people came in a great ship, but it was sent away.<eos> That's the story we get from everybody, sir.<eos> Marul, do you remember a team who came here from Earth two years ago?<eos> Oh, Colonel Grieves, of course.<eos> He asked that he might see the Sentinel to learn its mysteries, so that one day your people might be protected as we are.<eos> But to do that... that would be against our highest law.<eos> No one may see the Sentinel, except its Caretaker.<eos> Yeah, well... They did anyway.
Wide open.<eos> I'm bringing this case in big.<eos> So, this squares things with Burrell, right?<eos> To hell with the man.<eos> But I think we might have enough to reach out to the feds... try to run this thing through them.<eos> Cedric.<eos> He knows about the money, Marla.<eos> He's known for a long while.<eos> Fact is, I wouldn't be surprised if it's why he picked me for this case.<eos> What does he....
-Yeah, and that message is....<eos> -Out of sight, out of mind.<eos> Spoken like a true troglodyte.<eos> Whole lot of dead trees behind this nonsense.<eos> The foundation of your case, Detective.<eos> You lay it in right, you can build on it.<eos> You lay it in wrong, everything on top falls.<eos> We ready?<eos> Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the affidavit is true... and accurate to the best of your knowledge?<eos> -I do.

I grew up on Pacino.<eos> FBI!<eos> Stop!<eos> FBI! Freeze! Stop!<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - Don't shoot me, please.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> - Where's the child?<eos> - I don't have her.<eos> I never did.
The periodic table of elements.<eos> Yes.<eos> And you wrote in your report they were millions of years old.<eos> Based on radiometric readings from fossils encrusted on the surface of the ship.<eos> Agent Scully, I know you've become more open-minded about these things, but do you know what it is you're saying here?<eos> If it were true, these symbols wouldn'tjust be words.<eos> They'd be the very word of God on the surface of an alien spacecraft.<eos> It'd mean that everything mankind believes in... is in question.<eos> And you believe this?<eos> I didn't.
I didn't find it.<eos> You stole several files pertaining to the 1973 abduction of Mulder's sister.<eos> But yet you say there's danger to your life right now.<eos> The conspiracy to keep the truth about aliens from the American public, all but destroyed a few years ago, has given rise to a new conspiracy in the government now, by men who are alien themselves.<eos> And what does this have to do with you?<eos> What you can see they did to me was a failed attempt to turn me into one of these alien men.<eos> I was a guinea pig, a test subject.<eos> And now I want to expose their evil plans.<eos> What plans are those?<eos> To do this to you.
I ain't going, not in this shit.<eos> –And you're yelling "medic"?<eos> –I don't need no aid station.<eos> You're in luck, Penkala.<eos> We don't got no aid station.<eos> –You got scissors?<eos> –What do I need scissors for?<eos> Got your aid kit?<eos> Right, well, you don't need this.<eos> Not yet. I do.
The Toccoa men, that's the ones that was there at the very beginning.<eos> They are very close.<eos> They accept people coming in, like myself, as a replacement but you also had to prove yourself.<eos> Most of them were qualified parachutists.<eos> They had to be.<eos> A lot of them were awfully green, and we knew that.<eos> We hoped they could keep alive.<eos> A lot of them didn't.
Only 17, but he can kill.<eos> -Works for me.<eos> -He's an informer?<eos> Teammate.<eos> I got eyes everywhere.<eos> He gets to make some cash.<eos> Lets me know when big things happen.<eos> Big transactions.<eos> -You trust him?<eos> -Damn right I do.
-...you will understand--<eos> -Wait, doctor. That's a one-way trip.<eos> Yes, I expected that's how you would evaluate our chances.<eos> Well, am I wrong?<eos> No, I agree. We probably won't live long enough to extract the eighth spirit from the crater.<eos> Then why even try it?<eos> Because we don't need to extract the eighth spirit.<eos> If we can't bring the final spirit here we can go there and complete the wave inside the crater.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> And how do we do that, exactly?
Well, i'm three quarters through the understanding stage.<eos> But it hurts me, though. You know?<eos> And it's not good pain.<eos> I don't know that there ever really was good pain.<eos> I used to think so, but i don't now. - Ramble, ramble, ramble.<eos> - Hey, please, i get it.<eos> Come here.<eos> I missed you.<eos> Did you?<eos> Yes, i did.
Dark?<eos> Let's say... average height.<eos> Not a dwarf or a giraffe.<eos> Normal.<eos> Pretty, for her type.<eos> As for blonde or dark it's hard to say, but she wasn't a redhead.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> I do remember she casually asked if you had a girlfriend.<eos> And? I said you weren't interested, right?<eos> You didn't!
Oh, God!"<eos> [IN NORMAL VOICE] She will make you a real boy, for I will make her a real woman and all will be right with the world because you held my hand and saved my brain so that once again my customers may ask for me by name:<eos> "Gigolo Joe, what do you know?"<eos> DAVID:<eos> Why do you do that?<eos> That's just what I do.<eos> Now follow me and don't fall behind.<eos> All roads lead to Rouge!<eos> Don't they say that, hey?<eos> Don't they just?
They're gonna do the tour.<eos> Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, boy and girls, to the Paramount Pictures tour.<eos> This is where the magic happens, people.<eos> But before we actually begin, I'm gonna ask you all to raise your right hand.<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> Now what you're about to witness... are some of the biggest secrets of movie-making.<eos> So I must ask that all of you swear not to reveal anything you witness here.<eos> Do you swear?<eos> Uh, just say, "I do. "<eos> - [ All ] I do.
Like cherry pie on the wall.<eos> That was a good one.<eos> - I'm glad you liked it.<eos> - I'd say casinos are pretty original.<eos> - How many have you done so far?<eos> - One.<eos> - One? - Yeah.<eos> One casino?<eos> That is really lame, if you ask me.<eos> Well, I didn't, did I?
We are going to explode the bomb!<eos> It will be a fantastic explosion!<eos> And when the time comes, nobody must come down to the beach!<eos> You must watch from where you are!<eos> You must be one of the most stupid people I've ever met.<eos> You wanted to show off, so you nearly get us all killed.<eos> I can see your lips moving, but I can't hear a word you're saying.<eos> It should pass in a day or two.<eos> Your father says it will pass in a day or two.<eos> Does he?
Come on, get ready.<eos> It's important.<eos> Nah, you go ahead.<eos> I'm not big on parties.<eos> Oh, don't be a grump.<eos> Gimme a zip.<eos> Hey, ain't you in ladies' wear?<eos> Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?<eos> I don't work here.<eos> My wife does.
I mean, I'd understand if you came in here and... Socked me in the nose, whatever.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> I'm not proud of what I did.<eos> But you.<eos> Yeah, I paid up.<eos> As you well know.<eos> But then I went and found the pansy.<eos> Oh, you got nothin' to say?<eos> Well, you know the story.<eos> I didn't.
Okay, fine.<eos> Okay, see you later.<eos> See you.<eos> I'm just gonna stop by my bunk for a real quick sec.<eos> Maybe you should talk to him.<eos> So, then, Rabbi Rothstein says, "Sim, sim, sim, sim, ata..."<eos> Hey, McKinley.<eos> Did you take that shower yet?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Did you?
For the guys!<eos> Italian guys are hot!<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> You don't know them.<eos> - Right.<eos> Ceci wouldn't be able to betray me.<eos> She wanted to tattoo my name on her tit.<eos> - But her mother didn't want her to.<eos> - I took Ana's cherry.<eos> - She only does it with me.
He killed our son!<eos> - He...<eos> It was no accident!<eos> How long will he be sent away for?<eos> That's hard to say. Anywhere from 5 to 15 years. But we're confident we'll get the maximum.<eos> - So even with good behavior...<eos> -5, 10 years?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Dr. Fowler, Mrs. Fowler, I'm sorry. - I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.
And you think writing up flyers and underground meetings, and preparing resistance will accomplish this?<eos> It's not all I propose.<eos> We must strike back any way we can.<eos> And the German "collective responsibility"?<eos> You are proposing to spit at them.<eos> They'll retaliate against innocents, even harder than they did last time.<eos> They suffer anyway.<eos> They die of disease, starvation and worse and you negotiate as if Germans are reasonable?<eos> - Yes, I do. I try to minimize the harm.<eos> - So do we!
Are you crazy?<eos> We have no chance without a plan!<eos> - Nor do they if we don't get them out!<eos> - And if we get shot?<eos> - I'm going.<eos> - How will you get them out?<eos> Are you with me or not?<eos> We have no chance without the guide to take us in the sewers and out.<eos> Do you see a guide?<eos> Do you?
No time for sex.<eos> Bummer.<eos> -They're splitting again.<eos> -Put it away.<eos> We call no one, we tell no one. This is our secret.<eos> What about the government?<eos> They usually get involved.<eos> -No government.<eos> I know those people.<eos> -You do?
It's known to happen in my solar system as well.<eos> Which, I gather from the music you're listening to, is Brazil?<eos> You know Brazilian music?<eos> That's Bebel Gilberto's composition, "Sem Contencao"... recorded in 1999. Released on Six Degrees Records... and originally inspired by the legendary bossa nova artist, Joao Gilberto... who happens to be her father.<eos> Wait!<eos> - Have a coffee with me.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I'm late for dinner.<eos> According to the theory of relativity, time doesn't exist as we know it.<eos> Yeah, but my father does.
Don't you got a son, like 17, named Duquan?<eos> And a little girl about five named Maya?<eos> You tell my momma about them?<eos> She know.<eos> How come you ain't brought them around?<eos> You ashamed of them?<eos> They ugly like you?<eos> I don't get along too well with my babies' mommas.<eos> - I'm sure you understand that.<eos> - No, I don't.
- It's mine and you can't have it.<eos> I don't want to know the story behind this photo.<eos> Who's Sergio?<eos> - It's a nickname.<eos> - Your nickname is Sergio?<eos> It's a long story, and we don't know each other.<eos> - So many secrets.<eos> - I'm really an arms dealer.<eos> - I've never known an arms dealer.<eos> - You do now.
- I co-signed Martha Rayburn's car loan.<eos> Listen, Gladys, I got to buy some time here.<eos> I'm gonna need the imagery analysis for a military prison near Su Chou.<eos> And if you use the phones, don't use these.<eos> Any chance I could lose my job over this?<eos> Good.<eos> I didn't want to work for Andy Unger anyway.<eos> I know who it is.<eos> I know who Bishop was after.<eos> - Well, so do we.
God, that must be nice.<eos> Being neutral.<eos> Never having to take sides.<eos> Sleeping like a baby.<eos> - That's a simplistic way to look...<eos> - Don't defend me.<eos> What?<eos> No, she's right.<eos> So how do you sleep, Elizabeth?<eos> Actually, I don't.
[LOUD CHATTERING]<eos> Are you a Communist?<eos> Anything you want to say?<eos> CHAIRMAN [OVER RADIO]: The Committee will come to order.<eos> We'll have order in the chamber!<eos> Let me begin by saying we have a full agenda.<eos> I admonish those here to view testimony today to keep order... or this chamber will be cleared.<eos> The witness will please stand and raise his right hand.<eos> Do you swear the testimony you're about to give... will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
- Not by you, Mr. Clyde.<eos> - CHAIRMAN: Stand down!<eos> Not by anyone, ever.<eos> Too many people have paid in blood.<eos> Enough, sir!<eos> You are out of order!<eos> People like Luke Trimble... and all the sons of Lawson, California.<eos> STAN: Damn right.<eos> And they deserve better than this.<eos> All you boys do.
- I don't know.<eos> What are you doing, Max?<eos> - I'm preparing a fix. - He's preparing a fix.<eos> Do you want a taste?<eos> Richard, I told you I quit.<eos> You know I quit.<eos> I don't want it anymore!<eos> You don't tell me when you're gonna quit! I tell you! You don't tell me what you want!<eos> I tell you! How long will it take for a fucking junkie like you to betray me for a lousy fix? I won't betray you!<eos> Please, don't!
It's easy:<eos> You make fun of him and get yourself noticed.<eos> But when Bourdieu's gone, if the effect produced this evening could go on and the agitprop became self-managed, and the agitated became agitators<eos> - agitating themselves first of all - then I'd be really happy.<eos> I won't have been totally useless.<eos> People bad-mouth sociologists, and often with good reason.<eos> There are some...<eos> I don't recall who said,<eos> "The social workers are part of the problem."<eos> But in the work that we do...
He's prepared.<eos> He's ready.<eos> He may be prepared, but he's not ready.<eos> You know, we can use you.<eos> Hey, look, I just want to survive this and go home.<eos> - You make a deal with him?<eos> - What? That's what I would do.<eos> Go to you.<eos> - He knows what you're capable of. - Listen, man.<eos> - But so do I.
Hold on, hold on, not yet.<eos> Stop!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Jesus. What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Forceful is one thing but this is mad.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
It's not a question of my happiness.<eos> So, you're too proud, is that what it is?<eos> What about Lionel?<eos> What about him? Don't you see how unhappy he is?<eos> Oh, I can look after Lionel.<eos> I'm sure, but don't you ever think that for both your sakes that you ought to get rid of Arlena?<eos> Do you mean, divorce her?<eos> Of course.<eos> Arlena's my wife, and that's all there is to it.<eos> "'Til death us do part."
No.<eos> And you knew nothing about what was sold under the counter?<eos> No.<eos> That was also a "fluke."<eos> - I didn't do anything!<eos> Can you tell us where he is?<eos> No. - Mr. Schulz. I'll read you Section 184, agraph 4 of the Criminal Code.<eos> If the offender acts for gain or as part of a group, the punishment is imprisonment for a term of 6 months to 10 years, in addition to your probation.<eos> Are you scared of Mr. Valentin's testimony?<eos> I didn't do anything!
Speaking for myself, Monsieur Coleman, I have aged 10 years since I entered this automobile.<eos> It's none of your damn business how I behave.<eos> Of course it's my business.<eos> Now, you listen to me, Mr. Richard Carey... ERIC:<eos> Oh, there you are, Louise.<eos> I thought Miss Johnson might be up here.<eos> She's just going out to the dig.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> I'll try and catch her.<eos> How you doing there, Richard?
I've explained that... my wife's nervousness, her fears.<eos> No, doctor.<eos> Your wife, she is in danger, yes.<eos> She is threatened with death, yes.<eos> And you send not for the police, or not even for a private detective, but for a nurse. I thought...<eos> I...<eos> Why a nurse?<eos> Well, there is an answer, in fact, there can only be one answer... that you did not truly believe that your wife, she was in danger.<eos> God help me.<eos> I didn't.
And so... the behavior of Monsieur William Coleman on the day of the murder was indeed certainly suspicious.<eos> But I do not think that Monsieur Coleman, as Monsieur Coleman, has the temperament of a murderer.<eos> No.<eos> But there is nothing here to veto the idea that his personality, which is most cheery, might conceal the hidden one of Monsieur William Bosner.<eos> Why all of you listen to this chap beats me.<eos> Mademoiselle Maitland, when you arrived at the dig, did you see anyone?<eos> None of the expedition members, no.<eos> There seemed to be no one there but the Arab foreman. Shufta Mr. Carey?<eos> You did not even see Monsieur Carey?<eos> All right, yes, I did, for a few moments... near the dig.
-is anxious to get away.<eos> -No need to worry about that. I've no interest in the servants, only those connected to the dead man.<eos> I see. Thank you.<eos> Do you have a light, Inspector?<eos> I think we can let them all go home.<eos> Got their addresses after all.<eos> Dexter will be here tomorrow to confirm that.<eos> But don't worry, it doesn't end here.<eos> Whoever he is, I'll find him.<eos> I always do.
I m-miss Janet very much.<eos> I m-miss Janet because I used to store up funny things to tell her had happened to us... things I could no longer tell Iris.<eos> Another friend visited us in Oxford overnight, recently, and I found her cleaning the bath.<eos> I said, " Oh, please, T-T-There's no need."<eos> She said, " Oh, yes, there is. I want to take a bath."<eos> I was hoping to be able to tell Janet that story.<eos> S-She would have enjoyed it.<eos> S-She would've laughed...<eos> Anna Karenina... Tolstoy, you know... went on her way to the station to throw herself under a train... sees something funny which she thinks to tell Vronsky, her lover, about.<eos> We all do it.
As a child, I spent hours devouring those marvelous novels.<eos> I dreamt of someday visiting the kingdom of princess Dejah Thoris and walking under the two wild moons of Barsoom.<eos> You two will have to go it alone.<eos> I think I'll stay here for a while.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What's the matter, Herb?<eos> I can't go on. My air supply has run out.<eos> I swear to you that I'd like to but I can't.<eos> We knew that this moment would come, didn't we?<eos> Susana, didn't we?
ls there anything you can do at all?<eos> Just show me one thing you can do.<eos> Do you think you're a good wife?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Are you supportive of me?<eos> Do you help me?<eos> Do you support your husband?<eos> Do you help the children?<eos> Do you help us?<eos> Do you?
Human beings can't be trusted.<eos> You may trust your faith now, but it's fake.<eos> Your heart is somewhere else.<eos> You want me to kill her to stop the pain.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Think you can stand it?<eos> Say yes. Want me to kill your girl?<eos> Tell me.<eos> You want me to kill her.<eos> Don't you?
I say Class 4.<eos> We can smell it, 20 levels away.<eos> Must be vicious.<eos> Looks like, he jumped to her death.<eos> So, a flying ghost.<eos> Mr. Cool, even you can't fly.<eos> Step aside, watch me.<eos> Careful.<eos> Go do your own thing.<eos> Do your own thing
Why would he?<eos> Yes he will!<eos> Were bugged!<eos> Ken's in great debt.<eos> I'll talk to him<eos> And grab him if there's a chance.<eos> Notify the firemen.<eos> Sure.<eos> Don't curse!<eos> I didn't!
I'm straight up with you, you be straight up with me.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay, you got me.<eos> You are amazing, but this is my bad.<eos> I asked you to encourage him.<eos> I didn't expect you to be him.<eos> I guess I got a little carried away.<eos> But, all I wanted to do was make you happy.<eos> - You did.<eos> - I did?
Use two fingers.<eos> You can't live without men?<eos> Not without their dicks.<eos> How cute.<eos> Fucking bitch!<eos> Slurping soup like an idiot!<eos> You sleep around for 2000 yen.<eos> You thought your daddy loved you.<eos> But he actually despised you, right?<eos> Why do you.?
- See you in Berlin.<eos> - OK.<eos> - I've got to tell Dixon.<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> How do I make a switch invisible to my partner?<eos> He'll be there.<eos> - You cannot tell him the truth.<eos> - You don't know him.<eos> - That's my point.<eos> - But I do.
I don't know.<eos> Sir, I've already offered to come down ten percent.<eos> Ten... percent is not 20 percent.<eos> I'll eat the tax, but that is it.<eos> Chéri?<eos> I think I prefer the Lamborghini.<eos> You are the birthday girl.<eos> Could you do something with this?<eos> He doesn't sing in the car or in the shower.<eos> He doesn't even the national anthem at baseball games.
You don't have to apologise to me.<eos> I was just...<eos> I just see you working so hard.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I was talking to Francie.<eos> I need to do something that's not job-related.<eos> So maybe the four of us should go to Lake Arrowhead for a few days next week.<eos> - I've got a trip tonight.<eos> - Of course you do.
- This case? On cloning a human? - Yes.<eos> - As thou speaketh, my feet itcheth.<eos> - You're on.<eos> Excellent.<eos> - You told him? - Well...<eos> - I'll lose my edge. - No, you won't.<eos> Now he knows I'm trying to offset his rhythm.<eos> He said that you could never beat him.<eos> Not on this case or any case.<eos> Oh, he did?
And I was totally fooled.<eos> As lawyers, we're trained to look at events as reasonable men.<eos> Looking at myself--<eos> This sullen attitude, it's just too boring.<eos> Do you ever have a problem with being ridiculous?<eos> Never.<eos> This started two weeks ago when you decided you loved Ally.<eos> What did we agree to do?<eos> Declare your feelings.<eos> You didn't do that, did you?
-I don't want to.<eos> And I just can't make it happen.<eos> -Do you think in time, it'll just--?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> I always sang with my mother when I was little.<eos> To her when I got older.<eos> The truth is, I can't listen to music right now.<eos> You know, Malcolm, you're so smart and--<eos> You know tragedies happen to good people.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Am I doing it wrong?<eos> No, this looks perfect.<eos> - What's the problem?<eos> - I don't think that Nelle likes it.<eos> What is this?<eos> Sex dance, makes us better lovers.<eos> Remember, your idea?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Listen if you really, really want to turn a woman on...<eos> - Do you?
What do you mean, "speaking of saliva"?<eos> It's a simple question.<eos> Where is Cordelia?<eos> - I think she went out. - Out?<eos> - Did she happen to mention where?<eos> - She said an errand.<eos> When you say you "think she went out" you mean you know she went out because you spoke to her.<eos> - Well, I suppose that--<eos> - Suppose? - I did.<eos> Yes, I did.
That doesn't bode well.<eos> That truck's passed three times.<eos> - Maybe she's out on a date.<eos> - That's unlikely.<eos> - It's Friday night.<eos> - So?<eos> We are talking about the same Cordelia Chase, right?<eos> Correct.<eos> - Knowing her...<eos> - But you don't.
- Great.<eos> What does it say?<eos> He had trouble here with the tense. Ga-Shundi tenses are tricky buggers.<eos> I'm riveted.<eos> What does it say about the birth?<eos> - Actually, it's funny.<eos> It doesn't.<eos> - What do you mean? You said it did.<eos> - I did.<eos> - But it doesn't?
Are you saying you're gonna leave me?<eos> I have to.<eos> You have to be strong.<eos> I'm trying to...<eos> Trying to what?<eos> Desert me? Abandon me?<eos> Leave me all alone when I really need somebody?<eos> - I don't want to leave.<eos> - So don't.<eos> Please, don't.
The ER doc gave her something for the pain. It knocked her out.<eos> But she's gonna be all right?<eos> It's a fracture.<eos> It's gonna take some time.<eos> God, I'm... sorry.<eos> I just don't understand. I don't understand why you'd go to see somebody like Rack.<eos> And I don't understand why you'd drag Dawn into it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> The magic, I thought I had it under control, and then...<eos> I didn't.
Don't people usually storm out of the house when they're angry?<eos> So you're not even gonna consider this?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because if it was that easy for you to barge into my room all the way across town, imagine how easy it'd be if I actually lived here.<eos> Okay, could you just stop looking at the book for a second?<eos> No. It's my book too.<eos> If you lived here, you could look at it all the time.<eos> I understand why you guys are asking me.<eos> I really, really do.
They're suspicious enough as it is.<eos> Well, then maybe you shouldn't go back.<eos> I want to, to stop them.<eos> Look, I don't have much time.<eos> All I know is they're after someone who's gonna be at Pier and Pescadero at 8 a.m.<eos> - But I don't know who.<eos> - We might.<eos> Frank Pirelli runs Luxiron.<eos> But he doesn't want a big merger to happen.<eos> And the Brotherhood does.
I think I can take him on.<eos> - Come on, there's only one.<eos> - Lots of one.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> Lots of one.<eos> Pretty wack.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> - Talking.<eos> - But I don't hear anything.<eos> Oh, I do.
I worked on series X3 through the preliminary stages of X7, treating injuries, mostly.<eos> I also conducted medical experiments.<eos> Like breaking the arms and legs of young children?<eos> Your guinea pigs.<eos> Those kind of experiments?<eos> I was conducting research into how to accelerate osteoregeneration.<eos> Research that's allowing me to help your friend here.<eos> I transferred out of Manticore. I couldn't take it any more.<eos> Went down to El Salvador, or what used to be El Salvador before the invasion,<eos> - and did charity work in the countryside.
You two have something in common.<eos> T'Pol is a scientist as well.<eos> Your facility's impressive.<eos> Would you mind?<eos> If you're careful not to touch anything.<eos> You two are from the same province?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Must be difficult to make friends when you keep so much to yourself.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't mean to be evasive.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Lemony.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Nothing like a nice salad of lemony goodness.<eos> Mom.<eos> - I have something to tell you. - Yes?<eos> Well, it's like this.<eos> Could you put down your fork for a second?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Okay. You know Max?<eos> - No, I don't.
Remember that?<eos> This guy right here was me.<eos> Remember my face? My pudgy little pie-stained- from-McDonald's face.<eos> Remember the chunkiness?<eos> Where did it go?<eos> Look, we're just trying to go to Disney world.<eos> Oh, that is so great!<eos> See? Get him a hat.<eos> [Exhales] You really... You really want me to sign it?<eos> Yes, we do.
"What's it like to be a black doctor?"<eos> I just wish this was over.<eos> Why have we stopped?<eos> Roll 'em up<eos> Why do you think I wanna be a part of this?<eos> Kelso said it would make us role models.<eos> I just assumed...<eos> Everybody assumes that I'm a good athlete, or that I grew up poor, or that I love Sanford and Son.<eos> But you do love Sanford And Son.<eos> We both do.
- Just let it go?<eos> - No.<eos> Why wouldn't I wanna go to the symphony?<eos> - l didn't mean anything by it.<eos> - You meant something.<eos> - We've got to do something.<eos> - No, we really don't.
She did me, I did her.<eos> All that fucking and talking.<eos> Men work so hard!<eos> How does a strap-on work?<eos> Is it belted?<eos> Could we not have the strap-on conversation now?<eos> This night is hard enough as it is.<eos> - How does it work?<eos> - What did I say?<eos> It doesn't.
Her mother never observed it.<eos> Neither did Lucille.<eos> - I don't need any help.<eos> - You say you don't, but you were picking the wrong size.<eos> This one fits you.<eos> I can adjust my bra straps by myself.<eos> Please get your hands off my breasts!<eos> I'm not being fresh.<eos> I think I know what's best.<eos> No, you don't!
- If you fell, I would never send my boyfriend to help you.<eos> Yes, I know I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> Aidan's better in a crisis than I am.<eos> I can't even remember cream cheese.<eos> He saw me naked.<eos> Your boyfriend saw me naked on the floor on a bath mat!<eos> - Did he tell you that?<eos> - No, he's a gentleman.<eos> Well, he did!
You guys are coming to spinning class with us tomorrow, bright and early.<eos> No offense, but I'd rather drive a rusty railroad spike through my skull.<eos> Oh, just try it once.<eos> You might be surprised how it changes the way you feel.<eos> - I feel fine.<eos> - You know what, Ginnie?<eos> That is absolutely an inspired idea!<eos> Okay, ladies, let's get to bed.<eos> Because if your butt isn't on that bike by 6 a. M Derek doesn't let you in.<eos> So these tits do nothing for you, huh?
What if I duck you an extra five?<eos> I'm not charging you at all this month because last month you overpaid.<eos> You gave me a lot of good tips that session.<eos> I won't have it, don't offer it again.<eos> Alright, alright, Jesus.<eos> Let's get back to Gloria.<eos> She never wants any money neither.<eos> And you like this about her?<eos> She's, you know very independent-minded.<eos> That I do like.
What are you doing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> What's going on there?<eos> - Well, Sunday dinner.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - You wanna talk to your father?<eos> He's outside. - Burning a cross?<eos> I'm not sure I know what you're driving at, but I know now is not the proper time.<eos> - Here, your brother wants to talk to you.<eos> - No, I don't.
We can't follow them at impulse.<eos> You and Tom take a shuttle.<eos> What are you doing? If I can amplify your matrix,<eos> I might be able to disrupt the force field.<eos> I'm sorry I put us in this position, Captain.<eos> You said you wanted us to spend more time together.<eos> This isn't what I had in mind.<eos> Maybe... if we get back to the ship, we could try socializing a little more.<eos> This really isn't the place to be talking about this.<eos> Besides, I don't do a lot of socializing.
You're user number 4574, the one who's been accessing our personnel files.<eos> You don't care about Tyler.<eos> You've been waiting for something to use against us.<eos> Who are you getting your orders from, Colonel?<eos> This interview is over.<eos> Right, trips are set.<eos> Take the nine mil.<eos> If we get into it, make every shot count.<eos> - I cannot let you do this, Colonel.<eos> - Do what?
And this so-called prototype, what is he after?<eos> I think you know that too. He's after your partner Scully.<eos> You may not be aware that she was part of a program.<eos> Six years ago, Agent Scully was taken in a military operation staged as an abduction.<eos> They put a chip in her neck to monitor her.<eos> It was also used to make her pregnant with the first organic version of that same supersoldier.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Help us catch him so we can put him down, before he finds her.<eos> - You assume I know where she is.<eos> - Who does?
How long can you keep this up?<eos> How long until the next Billy Miles rears his head?<eos> The next threat?<eos> The next phantom?<eos> Do you ever stop to ask yourself?<eos> All the sacrifice, the blood spilled.<eos> You've given nearly a decade of your life.<eos> Where the hell is it all gonna end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it doesn't.
- What are you doing here?<eos> - They let me out of hospital.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I got Mulder in the parking garage watching Krycek.<eos> - What's Krycek doing here?<eos> - l'm trying to figure that out.<eos> - He's here with Agent Crane.<eos> - How the hell does he know Agent Crane?<eos> Damn good question.<eos> He doesn't.
I introduced Jack to the first Laker Girl.<eos> I still get the Christmas cards.<eos> 1982 through '84, traveling chef... for Gloria Estefan.<eos> The Miami Sound Machine!<eos> [Singing]<eos> - Do you dance, Mr. Del Valle?<eos> - Do I dance?<eos> I salsa, I rumba, I tango.<eos> Sometimes, I lambada.<eos> And once, at a bar mitzvah, I did the hokey-pokey.
All those with business before this Honourable Court draw near.<eos> You will be heard.<eos> Mr White, this is a simple matter of--<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> all we need is a simple fact or two.<eos> You're going to give your recollections of the accident at the corner of State and Main.<eos> Would you please swear him in?<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Do what?<eos> - No. I can't take the time off work.<eos> Your father owns the company.<eos> You can do anything, silly.<eos> - I don't want to talk about it. - You hate that job anyway.<eos> I don't see why you just don't quit.<eos> Because I want to fit in.<eos> Williams' party.<eos> I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace since I'm positive we won't have a decent table.<eos> But we do.
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING)<eos> (BOMBS RUMBLING)<eos> (GUNFIRE)<eos> BAGGER: You gonna be wanting a different club, Junuh?<eos> I can't do this.<eos> Just loose your grip up a smidge.<eos> -A man's grip is like a--<eos> -That's not what I'm talking about.<eos> -I know.<eos> -No, you don't.
I'm assuming...<eos> He knows because he was at the battle of Ca Lu.<eos> - Is that true? - Yes, sir.<eos> On what grounds are you calling your witness?<eos> Colonel Hodges made Colonel Childers' combat experience... part of his defense.<eos> Furthermore, Colonel Childers testified... that he never shoots unarmed people.<eos> My witness has an important perspective on that statement.<eos> I'm gonna allow the witness.<eos> Do you swear or affirm... that the evidence you shal I give in this case... shall be the truth, the whole truth... and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> Yes, I do.
Dad, she left you.<eos> Looking very attractive today.<eos> Why don't you sit down?<eos> Make yourself comfortable.<eos> You're very attractive-looking.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> Very sexy, you know.<eos> We never got it on, but.... I want you, Cleo.<eos> I really do, Cleo.
When they're disturbed, they glow.<eos> Come on!<eos> That night, we promised ourselves, and we honestly believed,... .. that no one would ever know.<eos> - I wanna talk.<eos> - About what?<eos> About you and Francoise.<eos> Whaddaya mean... me and Francoise?<eos> I mean, Richard,... - .. that I want her to be happy. - Yeah.<eos> I mean, of course.<eos> - We all do, right?
Therefore, "to be," means to "in to be."<eos> To the celestial and my soul's idol. The most beautified. Ophelia.<eos> Doubt that the stars are fire. Doubt that the sun doth move.<eos> Doubt truth to be a liar. But never doubt I love.<eos> To be, or not to be?<eos> To be, or not to be?<eos> To be...<eos> So oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them or by some habit that too much o'er leavens the form of plausive manners, that these men carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,<eos> their virtues else be they as pure as grace, shall in the general censure take corruption.<eos> How does my good Lord Hamlet?
His name is Jamal Wallace.<eos> Jamal Wallace is a friend of yours?<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> I helped him find his own words by starting with some of mine.<eos> In return, he promised never to say anything about me.<eos> A promise which he kept.<eos> While your visit seems heartfelt, I'm sure you will appreciate it will not change or interfere with this institution reaching a fair and proper decision in this case.<eos> There's one more issue here.<eos> Those words that I read today I didn't write them.<eos> Jamal Wallace did.
Sounds like they're conspiring to conspire.<eos> I can feel the lies vibrating from their home.<eos> I don't think she's in on it, man.<eos> Come on, I dream about this.<eos> I have actual dreams about this.<eos> About busting the top people, the rich people.<eos> White people. Hey. - White people.<eos> I know, I know. I don't think she's in on it, man.<eos> She knows Arnie Metzger.<eos> So does half of San Diego.
- I give you the Cliffs Notes on life. - We're like nobody else I know!<eos> I'm a college professor.<eos> Why can't I teach my own kids? Use me.<eos> Darryl says you use knowledge to keep me down.<eos> He says I'm a "yes" person and you are raising us in a "no" environment.<eos> Clearly, Darryl doesn't hear "no" much.<eos> I can't live here!<eos> I hate you!<eos> - William hates you.<eos> - I don't.
What do you mean?<eos> You love her, don't you? Cynthia?<eos> Cynthia's waiting for you.<eos> She said you'd know where.<eos> Say hi to my widow for me, will you?<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> Marry me.<eos> Jimmy told you.<eos> What?<eos> He didn't, did he?
It's young Master Long.<eos> My apologies!<eos> I'm Iron Eagle Sung and this is my brother in arms,<eos> Flying Cougar Li Yun.<eos> What brings you to Huai An, and where are you headed, Master Long?<eos> Anywhere there's action.<eos> In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> You don't seem to understand.<eos> So what if I don't?
Is that it; that makes it all happen?<eos> Step back.<eos> Travis, why the disguise?<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> And we have thought.<eos> Tobiah film has failed.<eos> He knew that my good because he worked as a sound recordist.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm not involved in your movie, these fake suicide psychiatric.<eos> Sam did it.
I will take care of this.<eos> - Now, we're trusting you here, so...<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I'll talk to you soon, okay?<eos> I'm not saying it's not a strong case.<eos> Otherwise, they wouldn't have dropped the demurrers. I wouldn't be here.<eos> What I am saying is, we don't have a smoking gun that ties San Francisco to Hinkley.<eos> Something that proves that prior to 1987 PG and E Corporate knew the water was bad there and did nothing about it.<eos> - Erin, I thought you took a sick day.<eos> - So did I.
It's from Long Island.<eos> Here, have another.<eos> - What's the latest, Kathryn?<eos> - Me, as usual.<eos> Court, I'd like you to meet Cherie Clayman.<eos> How's it going, Cherie?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I think we should adjourn to the ladies' room.<eos> - But I don't have to go.<eos> - I do.
Help!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> I'm cold, Rose.<eos> I'm so cold.<eos> I'm sinking.<eos> It's mayhem!<eos> It's chaos!<eos> Nobody saw anything!<eos> -You see anything, Matthews?<eos> -No, sir. I did!
As the washing up isn't working out-<eos> - I washed up yesterday.<eos> - For the first time in months.<eos> - It was 3 or 4 days' worth!<eos> - Or months... I washed up the day before.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> - I did.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Sure I did.<eos> - Anna, you didn't.
I mean, I instinctively feel I want loads more out of life... than just being someone's housewife.<eos> I'd love to be a housewife.<eos> I must find a man first.<eos> You'll find someone, you'll see.<eos> I'm starting to doubt it.<eos> He's here somewhere, I promise.<eos> Yes, tell your ex that I'm available.<eos> That'll be quite difficult. Yes.<eos> No one wants me.<eos> Of course they do.
Well, I haven't had this much fun making out since--<eos> I've never had this much fun making out. Me either.<eos> - Don't let this get weird at work?<eos> - No. We have nothing to be embarrassed about.<eos> We made out.<eos> You and I made out. - And if I may, it was--<eos> - Sexy as hell. God.<eos> That's just what I was about to say.<eos> But I think I said it first, I think.<eos> - Oh, no, you did. - Oh.
Let's be honest.<eos> You're not like most of the girls here.<eos> Your technique is nowhere near where it should be.<eos> There's more to being a great dancer than perfect technique.<eos> -Try dancing Swan Lake without it.<eos> -Am I hearing this?<eos> Look, you're really smart.<eos> If you send your application now, you could get into a good college.<eos> I don't want to go to college. I want to dance.<eos> Well, so do a lot of people.
I checked out Kathy Morningside.<eos> - Anything?<eos> - Not even a traffic ticket.<eos> Model citizen.<eos> Beauty contestant, pageant director, loving mom.<eos> - She's married?<eos> - Widow. One son.<eos> A sniveling, obsequious weasel of a human being.<eos> - You know her son?<eos> - So do you.
You look forward to the moment you'll get him.<eos> In this business, you're always happy to destroy a guy... who is above the law.<eos> - And then?<eos> - And then...<eos> He was really above the law. We busted our asses for months, and it was over in one day. Case over.<eos> Everybody goes home.<eos> Go have fun somewhere else.<eos> The law...my ass!<eos> - So you guys resigned.<eos> - I did.
You're always with Castella.<eos> What are you doing with him?<eos> We have a project together.<eos> We need to discuss things.<eos> You found a gold mine. That's nice. Mostly for Benoit.<eos> He won't have to worry for a while.<eos> That doesn't bother you?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Why should I be bothered? Perhaps I have too many scruples.<eos> And I don't?
To be tied to the bed?<eos> He never beat me.<eos> Never!<eos> You did well to come out.<eos> The air is good for you.<eos> - This way.<eos> - No, the walk tired me.<eos> - Shall I? - No, stay.<eos> Your mother wasn't to go out.<eos> But she did.
What the hell is that?<eos> - Just a little.<eos> I'm going to tell you something, and this is for your own good, okay?<eos> No one likes you.<eos> They don't?<eos> No.<eos> - You didn't notice?<eos> - Well, no.<eos> - What did I do?<eos> Why doesn't anybody...
What else can we use?<eos> How much is it?<eos> How much is it, Dad?<eos> About 350 pounds.<eos> Fracture of the fifth metacarpal of the right hand... as well as multiple fractures of the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.<eos> The worst of the injury, however, was sustained to the right leg... in the form of a spiral fracture.<eos> There were 14 breaks.<eos> It simply shattered.<eos> They call me Mr. Glass.<eos> - Who does?
-Did I do a good job?<eos> -It looks great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> What do I owe you?<eos> -The guys said you're interested in UFOs.<eos> -Yup.<eos> -Do you think they land here?<eos> -No, but they fly close to here.<eos> Do they?
I've got serious work to do!<eos> At least I haven't lost sight of what's really important.<eos> Well, l-l-l really didn't have enough time... to gather any firewood.<eos> I am down to this... Last lonely honey pot.<eos> Well, come to think of it, uh... we don't really look or act very much like tiggers.<eos> Thought I was pretty convincing.<eos> We gotta do it! We have to do it!<eos> Think how sad Tigger's gonna feel.<eos> Oh, but we don't really know how to be a tigger.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Hey, calm down.<eos> Calm down.<eos> You sent Carmen only for the pleasure of making me sin.<eos> She came?<eos> It didn't work out?<eos> Why do you hate my purity?<eos> - Your purity?<eos> You're such a sanctimonious hypocrite.<eos> I hate you Ramallo.<eos> - No, you don't.
For those of our parents.<eos> For the lives they stole from us.<eos> Kill him.<eos> He's innocent. -Kill him!<eos> Do it for me.<eos> For the life I never had.<eos> A life in your shadow. They created you.<eos> And they rejected me.<eos> Do it. Kill him, Fanny.<eos> Do it!
Now, I could suspend you, but I won't do that.<eos> However, I will make a formal request that you see the department counselor.<eos> I don't have time for that, Captain.<eos> There's a child's life at stake.<eos> All the more reason.<eos> It's not optional.<eos> Now, go make an appointment before you do any more work on this case.<eos> Expect to see me come out in handcuffs? No.<eos> Why?<eos> Did you do somethin' bad?
Show me.<eos> Voila ce qui est curieux.<eos> How say you, Chief Inspector?<eos> No-one would sit in a chair in such a position, I fancy.<eos> It's an odd place for it to be, all right.<eos> But I can't see that it's important.<eos> It is completely unimportant.<eos> That is why it is so interesting.<eos> These shoes match the marks on the window sill precisely.<eos> Of course they do, Inspector.

Compared to her, that trance she was in I was just a sperm donor.<eos> Maybe sex wasn't meant for men.<eos> Hlynur?<eos> - Yes. - Take a seat, dear.<eos> We need to have a little talk.<eos> Are you sure that's necessary?<eos> Yes, I think it is.<eos> Lola and I have been talking things over.<eos> And? I think we both know what I'm talking about.<eos> - We do, don't we? - Yes, we do.
Who says I can't use a skillet?<eos> Bonjour, monsieur.<eos> Bonjour.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Up. Come on.<eos> His skull can't be as thick as we thought.<eos> It was like swatting a fly.<eos> The worst is over.<eos> He found out what you're made of.<eos> So did I.
What are you talking about?<eos> The fire, Monsieur le Comte.<eos> I know it was the right thing to do... but I can't get rid of the faces and the screams.<eos> The fire... The fire was an act of God.<eos> It was me, Monsieur le Comte.<eos> What?<eos> You told me.<eos> Remember?<eos> "Something has to be done, Serge. "<eos> You did, didn't you?
"What makes a good actor, what do you like in one?"<eos> We chatted, and he said, "I want all actors to chat with the camera like you and I are chatting."<eos> I was in the chorus, one of the kids who danced in the background in the Tiboli Theater.<eos> I got close to Bunuel's desk.<eos> He looked at me and gave me a piece of paper to read with the famous line: "Mess with me, you pay for it." Everyone said it overacting.<eos> I don't know, God illuminated me and I said,<eos> "Mess with me, you pay for it."<eos> He said, "Can you do that better?"<eos> I said yes, and in take two<eos> I did it the same way.
- The Polish waitress asked me in. - Really?<eos> She did it to annoy her father. This guy was more Catholic than Lech Walesa.<eos> I killed him.<eos> For real.<eos> Do you have proof of what you're saying?<eos> Not proof, only the memory.<eos> But believe me... that's enough.<eos> François, you and I are materialists.<eos> Don't tell me you no longer believe in hard evidence.<eos> - Of course I do. - Good.
On the beach.<eos> Her family has a cabin there.<eos> And what are you going to do?<eos> I don't know... We're going to screw.<eos> She told me so.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Cause you'd get pissed off.<eos> No, why should I?<eos> You should know.<eos> Well, I don't.
Got a wife?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> - Something wrong with her?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Why d'you ask?<eos> Scared that you'd make us split up?<eos> Or that you wouldn't be able to?<eos> I would if I wanted to.<eos> But I don't.
Look.<eos> Let me say it again.<eos> I don't deny his popularity,or even that he's a wonderful man.<eos> It's just that he's such a big liability.I have a responsibility to the others.<eos> All right. The controlling cosiderationis the welfare of the home.<eos> If I were running it,perhaps I'd try to sustain his residency.<eos> But I'm not running it --neither are the three of you.<eos> From what I've seen,this falls within Mrs. Taylor's discretion.<eos> If she believes the welfare of the other residents iscompromised by his being here ...<eos> I do. ...
Your Honor, may I remind the court thatMr. Potts suffers from a compulsive disorder<eos> - that makes him clap his hands on occasion.<eos> Well, Mr. Vault, why not just wear the suit,if it'll keep your employment?<eos> Deep down, ever since I was twelveyears old, I've known.<eos> - You've known what, sir? - That I'm a woman..trapped in a man's body.<eos> Finally, I went to a doctor.<eos> He tells me thatI have a fetish for wearing women's clothes.<eos> You see, this here is a medical thing.<eos> Did you tell Mr. Schoefieldthis was a medical condition?<eos> Yes, I did.
Previously on Angel:<eos> So Wolfram Hart brought you back.<eos> - What's the plan?<eos> - We want him dark, not dead.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - You stop. God doesn't want you.<eos> But I still do.
Hold it still.<eos> Time to go home.<eos> Let her go or your leader's dead.<eos> Go. Go!<eos> - Don't bring your war here.<eos> - I have to.<eos> If this enemy persists, our society crumbles.<eos> - Here, you'll have another enemy.<eos> - You don't understand, human.<eos> No, I don't.
- You missed.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> This vein on my temple is doing the cha-cha because I just had one of those bone-crunching, mind-splitting vision headaches.<eos> New job.<eos> This place is like where I grew up.<eos> Right. Yeah, I could see that except for the cars, the buildings and the, you know, everything else.<eos> It's not so different.<eos> People moving through their lives.<eos> I wonder if anything changes.<eos> Sure it does.
- I have to go.<eos> We'll find a cure.<eos> I've been around long enough to recognize a lost cause.<eos> Unless....<eos> That's exactly what they want us to do, Darla.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> - I can't do it.<eos> - I need it.<eos> No, you don't.
Thanks!<eos> Sure.<eos> So what do you think, Buffy?<eos> I mean, if I'm wrong, smack me.<eos> Karen with a K will lend you a book, and it's pretty heavy.<eos> Maybe I have been blaming him.<eos> But how do I get past it?<eos> What if it's too late?<eos> What if after all this he doesn't want me any more?<eos> He does.
- But, Leo...<eos> - But it's the best I could do.<eos> You know, no ID, no mode of transportation, no money.<eos> I just wanted you to have something, mark the day.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have something for you too.<eos> Although not nearly as romantic, but still a good thing.<eos> Your first paycheque.<eos> Or cash, rather. I thought it'd be easier.<eos> So did I.
They might as well have taken all of mine.<eos> They shut down the club. They'll ruin it.<eos> I'll lose everything.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> Once this whole thing gets straightened out...<eos> I have a feeling it's not gonna be that easy.<eos> I overheard some doctors talking.<eos> There's others here infected with the disease.<eos> - But I thought it wasn't contagious.<eos> - Yeah, so did I.
That's why demons disappear when you guys vanquish them.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Just curious.<eos> - Okay, adíos.<eos> - Wait, Phoebe.<eos> Don't you wanna sign Dad's birthday card?<eos> Why?<eos> He never sends me one.<eos> She's right.<eos> He doesn't to any of us.
He'll be okay.<eos> 1329 Prescott Street.<eos> On the receipt.<eos> In the bag.<eos> It was there.<eos> That sounded much better in my head.<eos> They gave you our books, and you thought you'd drop them by.<eos> That wasn't so hard when you said it.<eos> I actually need the ones I bought, so if you don't mind, I...<eos> Of course you do. Okay.
What?<eos> No.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It just seems like whenever I get close to you you pull away from me.<eos> Why do you do that?
You see when we've gone wrong?<eos> Look, Steve's going with his ex and me, but I think he's gonna pretend to be with her, so I want my ex there, just to show him what it feels like.<eos> I can't do that to Steve, he's a friend<eos> Oh so tell me about your friend, "pizza boy"!<eos> Oh are we playing now?<eos> Does you ? thinking Patrick?<eos> I don't know, I'll ask him.<eos> That is the single lamest attempt anyone has ever made to get me to go out with him.<eos> Sally, how do you fancy coming with me at Susan's new boyfriend's ex's aunt's funeral?<eos> - I don't do funerals.
You told him about the Aamco thing?<eos> -No.<eos> -Very funny.<eos> -l work for Aamco.<eos> -Very funny joke.<eos> I work for Aamco.<eos> No, I'm not kidding you. I do.<eos> -Of course.<eos> He's terrific.<eos> -He does work for Aamco.
-Good, Arkansas, I've never been there.<eos> -You must come.<eos> I don't think.... They don't let me into certain states, actually.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'm incorrigible.<eos> You know what?<eos> I have some pull there.<eos> -l used to know the governor.<eos> -Your daughter knows the governor?<eos> We both did, yes.
Are you kidding me?<eos> I love Archie and the whole gang.<eos> Well, um, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy.<eos> Uh, but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money.<eos> So Reggie hires him as his assist...<eos> As his butler.<eos> And makes him do crazy things like bring him milk shakes that can't have lumps.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That sounds a little familiar.<eos> Did they already do that?
Hotel Monica!<eos> Just tell me how you like your eggs.<eos> I thought I'd bring them to you in bed.<eos> -You've been through so much.<eos> -I have.<eos> This right here is where I keep the pizza.<eos> And that's where the napkin is.<eos> -What's that smell?<eos> -I know!<eos> I don't...
-Tell her the truth, tell her you're not ready.<eos> I could do that.<eos> -What if she gets upset?<eos> -Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.<eos> Or you could just, you know, you...<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> What the hell am I doing?<eos> You just broke my fridge!<eos> What?<eos> How do..?
-Home invasion by an old roommate.<eos> It's different now.<eos> She was demanding and possessive.<eos> Now she wants me to do stuff, be with her.<eos> There you go, dearies.<eos> It's a relief to meet you, Amy.<eos> It's hard adjusting to all the strange stuff of the future.<eos> I'm from Mars.<eos> I feel so out of place. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well.<eos> Because he didn't in your time.
The document didn't come in till after 6, so I'll get it notarized in the morning. Yeah. Okay.<eos> Got it. Okay, Doug. I love you.<eos> Did I just tell Doug Pruzan that I loved him?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Do you?<eos> No! I said "Doug," and then the "I love you"<eos> just slipped out right behind it. So call him back.<eos> I can't. He was calling me from the plane.<eos> Well, it's noisy in there, you know. Maybe he didn't hear you or understand what you said.<eos> Well, what if he did?
But she didn't wanna hear a word of it.<eos> Anyway, it was a pleasure to meet you.<eos> Maybe someday, when this blows over, we'll sit on my boat and have a good laugh.<eos> If you still have to pee, feel free to go on the azaleas.<eos> They're hers.<eos> Doug?<eos> Yes?<eos> Did you just say you were gonna tell me you loved me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
I don't make this bust, I'll need the job.<eos> My lieutenant, he wants results.<eos> What's your first step?<eos> Making good friends with the bad guys.<eos> Yo, mon. How's it going?<eos> Some cultural reading, eh?<eos> What, all of a sudden you wanna be my yaga yaga?<eos> I asked around.<eos> People say you're cool.<eos> Do they?
Do you wanna go to the Hopper exhibit Saturday afternoon?<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to work.<eos> I lied.<eos> I don't have to work.<eos> I'm meeting Big for lunch and I didn't think you'd approve.<eos> - You're meeting Big?<eos> - He called.<eos> - He sounded upset and needed to talk.<eos> - Since when does Big talk?
Come on, we're gonna do it.<eos> A little later, freshly showered and freaked out, I drove to the studio for my meeting with Matthew McConaughey.<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> - Building five?<eos> There aren't any hills in there, are there?<eos> - Go down there, make a left.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I do. I like all of it.<eos> Your writing is brilliant.<eos> I really do.
- Isn't Pussy your friend?<eos> But that's the friend that was almost carried off by the ducks, right?<eos> The worst part of this is, it's one of those times I know I'm dreaming.<eos> Let's look at it.<eos> When you say "Pussy," you mean my friend Pussy or, you know, pussy?<eos> Whatever seems to be dominating your thoughts.<eos> I got pussy on the brain.<eos> I always do.<eos> I want to fuck you.<eos> I always did. "Do. "
I'm telling you she's B'Elanna Torres. The real B'Elanna Torres!<eos> I saw her ship!<eos> The lead actress, in a fit of jealousy brands her rival an Eternal.<eos> Our patron rises to his feet to stop the play.<eos> Nicely done.<eos> I almost believed you.<eos> Continue.<eos> Stay.<eos> Voyager needs me. So do I.<eos> No, you don't.
If that's true, then we can't be sure of anything.<eos> My memory's fine.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What did you do in the mines?<eos> - I mined.<eos> - No, what did you do?<eos> I remember shovelling ore into a cart.<eos> And?<eos> I did that a lot.
- May I ask why?<eos> We have in place an impenetrable shield - an iris - that would result in your death.<eos> Then... the three volunteers we sent through the portal...?<eos> There was no way to determine if they were friend or foe.<eos> I see.<eos> And... that is still the case.<eos> Clearly, we must gain your trust.<eos> They're transmitting visual.<eos> Now you can see foryourself that we are kindred.<eos> - We do.
- Skinner.<eos> - Sir? - Agent Scully, where are you?<eos> - I'm on the road.<eos> - I'm sorry to call you on this line.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> It's just we've been worried about you.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> I just wanted you to express that to Mulder.<eos> - He's standing right here.<eos> Why don't you do that yourself.
Where'd that come from?<eos> There are women here at the Bureau that he would confide in.<eos> I don't know if you knew that or not.<eos> - When was this?<eos> - lt's just talk.<eos> So what do you think happened to Mulder?<eos> What's your theory?<eos> What's my theory?<eos> My theory is you don't know Mulder at all.<eos> You never did.
So nobody know where you are, right? Your Army don't know.<eos> I'm gonna send you to Baghdad for a long time. Nobody found you.<eos> -Do they care, buddy?<eos> -Does who care?<eos> Do your Army care about the children in Iraq?<eos> Do they come back to help?<eos> No, they're not coming.<eos> [SPEAKING IN ARABIC]<eos> said [lN ENGLISH]:<eos> Do your Army...
Buzz! Buzz, get behind the tyres!<eos> Jessie, let go of the plane!<eos> What?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Just pretend it's the final episode of Woody's Roundup.<eos> But it was cancelled!<eos> We never saw if you made it!<eos> Well, then, let's find out together!<eos> We did it! We did it! We did it!<eos> We did it! We did it! We did it!
- So is this your band?<eos> - No, it's a pick-up band.<eos> - Who do you normally play with?<eos> - Anybody, anywhere.<eos> I got another gig later tonight.<eos> You're playing somewhere else tonight?<eos> They only get started around 2.<eos> In the Village?<eos> Believe it or not, I don't actually know the address yet.<eos> You don't?
Dances, calligraphy, how to do my hair how to sit without moving.<eos> What's the point of that?<eos> It's a part of grace.<eos> You boys don't understand.<eos> Try me.<eos> She doesn't let me get away with anything.<eos> It's the same for me.<eos> Except it's my dad.<eos> Know what would happen to an operator who got his sleeve caught in the press?<eos> Do you?
- They're sending you to Europe?<eos> - I think so.<eos> Why did you have to volunteer?<eos> They'll hear everything.<eos> Wouldn't some music be nice?<eos> Have you ever done this before?<eos> Never.<eos> You're my only.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
So, what is it that brings you back to London after all these years?<eos> Business or pleasure?<eos> As it happens I have some business with your friend, Sir Robert Chiltern... which, is of course, a great pleasure.<eos> And what is it that brings you here tonight?<eos> I came because you asked me to.<eos> And because you were curious?<eos> I suppose.<eos> Why did you ask me?<eos> Because I was curious also to see whether you'd come.<eos> And you did.
- His was the wrong time.<eos> - I got him up from 150.<eos> - I'm proud.<eos> - I feel like a new man.<eos> I'm so happy.<eos> I know you're upset about the car, but you can't come in here.<eos> his is a patient's private session.<eos> You know me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No, you don't.
You cooperated with the feds.<eos> hey played me a tape. I heard you say you were gonna kill me.<eos> - I heard the tape. - Never.<eos> On my mother's life.<eos> - Never.<eos> - I heard it.<eos> It's not important now, but I did not betray you.<eos> I had a wire, but took it off because I think I can help.<eos> I don't want to know what you think.<eos> Yes, you do.
Am I?<eos> And you?<eos> I know about the ace of diamonds.<eos> Every prisoner is supposed to spend a half an hour outside. Every prisoner, every day.<eos> We can only afford the time and personnel to do a rotation... One patient a day... so we make it random, use the cards.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> It keeps them focused on something.<eos> The strong take it from the weak every time.<eos> And the rest of them focus their anger on the ones who take it... and not on the guards or medical staff.<eos> It does work. For us.
"Shazam!" That's way cliché.<eos> My dear boy, how could you call one a cliché and the other a classic?<eos> The situations they're used in are often clichéd... and it has to do with the superhero who's saying it.<eos> What did you say?<eos> - Captain Amazing is in danger.<eos> - What sort of danger?<eos> He went into Casanova's. He didn't come out.<eos> To the rescue!<eos> - It doesn't work.<eos> - No, it does.
Tank, load the jump program.<eos> You have to let it all go, Neo.<eos> Fear doubt and disbelief.<eos> Free your mind.<eos> Okey-dokey.<eos> Free my mind.<eos> What if he makes it?<eos> - No one's ever made their first jump.<eos> - I know.<eos> - But what if he does?
- We got a deal.<eos> Get lost!<eos> Car radios?<eos> A UFO!<eos> Hey, you crazy ass!<eos> - Fuck off.<eos> Watch out I don't slit the fucking tires on your shitty car!<eos> - Shitty car!<eos> You speak German?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Where the hell are you going?<eos> To get you proof.<eos> Run the name, Whit.<eos> Was it hard to find me?<eos> You've moved several times.<eos> Your wife said that-- Your ex-wife said--<eos> Mister, I've been through all this before.<eos> The government, the police... and writers.<eos> People wanted to believe it was political... some conspiracy, some group.<eos> Happy and I did too.
I don't know.<eos> They're at the Riviera, room 660.<eos> Keep the change.<eos> Here we go.<eos> We got 30 seconds to get out!<eos> - Get up!<eos> - Grab what you can!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Get up, man!<eos> - Just do it now!
You know the socks with elastic around the ankle to keep it from stretching out?<eos> All my socks have that.<eos> One day, I went into the drawer and there was a pair that didn't.<eos> - So...<eos> - You hear that?<eos> We got John Sherlock Holmes in here.<eos> You've been fucking around too.<eos> Only after I found out.<eos> So, Zack, do you know who your girlfriend's fucking?<eos> No, Adam, I do not.
SCRUGGS: Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.<eos> Okay, Jeff. I'm gonna sit you down at that table over there.<eos> I want to start as fast as possible.<eos> I don't want to give them a chance to get another restraining order. Okay?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Good luck, Doc.<eos> Please stand.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> WIGAND: I do.
- She ain't gonna make it.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> A year?<eos> Five cartons says she offs herself inside of six months.<eos> - Get away from me.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Heard you did your husband.<eos> He probably deserved it.<eos> Mine did.
So bring up the reinforcements.<eos> Reinforcements?<eos> Where?<eos> Right behind us.<eos> Dunois with another 10,000 men.<eos> -Jeanne, look behind you!<eos> -Never look behind.<eos> Only ahead!<eos> Do you know how to count?<eos> Of course I do!
And you're gonna go in tomorrow... they're gonna throw you out on the street.<eos> You know why?<eos> So Bill Lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point.<eos> Ugh. Michael, let's make that stock go down... and let's take enough money out of that place... so that we never have to sit in a cubicle ever again.<eos> Your software works, right?<eos> Of course it works.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't know how to install it.<eos> I don't know the credit union's software well enough.<eos> Yeah. But Samir does.
Um, the 7-Eleven, right?<eos> You'd take a penny from the tray.<eos> From the crippled children?<eos> No, that's the jar.<eos> I'm talking about the tray...<eos> The pennies for everybody.<eos> Oh, for everybody.<eos> OK. Yeah. Well, those are whole pennies.<eos> I'm just talking about fractions of a penny, OK?<eos> But we do it from a much bigger tray... and we do it a couple of million times.
Did you even think twice?<eos> - No.<eos> - You knew what you were doing?<eos> My job.<eos> He likes me.<eos> He'll keep liking me.<eos> Keep him right next to me.<eos> And you don't care what that makes you.<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> - Do you really?
Well...<eos> Since it's confession night... at Our Lady of Perpetual Disco<eos> I'm gonna tell you something that I've never told anyone.<eos> I've got...<eos> Mr. Z's money.<eos> I got here right when you were being rushed to the hospital, you know.<eos> And when the cops left, I went up.<eos> Cos Amber had given me her key and told me where she had always hid her money.<eos> She always had some money set aside for her funeral cos she always knew that she was gonna die young.<eos> And of course, she did. Poor baby.
Attention.<eos> Convective Sigma 3 Echo in effect for Washington-Baltimore area.<eos> A line of thunderstorms approximately 60 miles wide moving from 260 degrees at 15 knots with tops to flight level 350.<eos> Wind gusts to 60 knots and possible cloud-to-cloud lightning.<eos> Visibility occasionally one mile...<eos> I said I wouldn't take PAC money.<eos> - That's when we didn't need it.<eos> - What do I say now?<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth?<eos> I do.
-l got this. You take care of that.<eos> We caught him a couple times. Dont let him know.<eos> Caught what?<eos> Mind your business.<eos> What you got there?<eos> 45 what?<eos> Emmet, put that shit away.<eos> Wanna go to the dump, shoot some rats?<eos> -Shoot some what, man?<eos> I do it all the time.
I saw the Terrance and Phillip movie.<eos> Who wants to touch me?<eos> I said, who wants to fucking touch me?<eos> We gotta see the Terrance and Phillip movie too.<eos> I hate you, Kenny.<eos> Shut your fucking face Uncle fucker<eos> You're a boner-biting bastard Uncle fucker<eos> Okay, children, let's take our seats.<eos> We have a lot to learn today.<eos> We sure do, Mr. Hat.
would you just pass the goddamn house? !<eos> Look, the house is making a right.<eos> When I was in college, we had to write a term paper.<eos> It was for some philosophy course I was taking...<eos> ... onanybookweconsidered...<eos> ... tobetheone thatbest depicted how we viewed the world.<eos> I remember some people picking books by the great thinkers...<eos> ... likeKierkegaardandplato.<eos> Some kids chose the bible.<eos> I did my paper on Harold and the Purple Crayon.
- What happened?<eos> You didn't tell them what happened?<eos> That freaky bastard scared my customers.<eos> They thought he was the Son of Sam. - Who? Who?<eos> - Fuckin' Ritchie. I never seen nothin' like it, not even in Nam.<eos> He's fuckin' exaggerating'.<eos> The kid was there lookin' like Night Of The Living Dead.<eos> My customers get nervous just from lookin' at him.<eos> So I go over and I ask him very nice... Come on! It didn't happen like that.<eos> - No, it fuckin' didn't!
You seem out of sorts.<eos> My leg hurts a bit.<eos> Want a massage?<eos> No.<eos> It's the change of weather.<eos> You had some calls.<eos> Three shots, two massages.<eos> The names are by the mail.<eos> I try to be useful.<eos> Everyone does.
I'm leaving in one minute.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to explain to you.<eos> Before I became a cop, I was a gambler I got involved in some very bad situations.<eos> There's one situation that I got involved with that's coming back now, it'll come across your desk.<eos> This guy named Jimmy Fordo.<eos> There's a basketball fix.<eos> I know the case.<eos> I think I understand where you're leading this.<eos> Do you?
"Cause you were smart and funny.<eos> And short.<eos> You know, we fi gured it"d be good foryou to... spend a little time with some tall white people.<eos> - Yeah. - What, did you do it "cause I"m black?<eos> And you thought I couldn"t do it myself?<eos> - Rubin did it all himself, you know.<eos> Hey, Les, we didn"t feel sorry foryou.<eos> We met you and got to know you and realized you could accomplish some things... and, like a lot of us, you could use some help.<eos> I"m sure that Hurricane Carter had some help along the way.<eos> - None of us does it alone. - Hey.
Everybody together!<eos> I can"t stand it.<eos> So, uh, Rubin, how"s the appeal goin"?<eos> Uh, we hear it"s with the NewJersey Supreme Court. Have they set a date?<eos> Why don"t we talk about Lesra?<eos> I"m sure that Lesra wants to know what"s happening with your case too.<eos> My case is doing what it"s doing.<eos> I have to focus on the fact that I have to do the time.<eos> I do that by not allowing myselfto want or to need... anything.<eos> How do I do that?
Want to come in? - Yeah.<eos> I will drop-kick those fucking dogs if they come near me.<eos> Come on in.<eos> This is Blake. Clear them out.<eos> All right, he's in here. So we all go in here.<eos> Want to go in?<eos> No, I just stand here a second, Phil.<eos> Hey, wake up.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> How do we do this, then?
We meet again, Commander.<eos> Hello, Sarris.<eos> How you doin'? Better than my lieutenant.<eos> He failed to activate the ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped... on our last encounter.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, I'd like to say I'm real sorry about what happened before.<eos> The whole thing was just... just a misunderstanding.<eos> Deliver the device to me, or I will destroy your ship.<eos> You know, um, we'd like do that, but frankly, Sarris, sir, we don't know what it is or even where it is.<eos> You have ten seconds!<eos> I don't... Ten seconds?
Group. I have found something very disturbing this morning.<eos> I would like to know who has been sneaking out, with those smut peddling recruiters?<eos> I want to know who is involved.<eos> Fine then.<eos> Graham?<eos> What do you have to say for yourself?<eos> Why are you looking at me?<eos> Do you have anything you'd like to confess?<eos> I didn't sneak out.<eos> No, I don't, but um...
No. Where do you want to go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Can you drive? Yes.<eos> Don't tell anyone but Nina's got problems with junk.<eos> Do you know where she'd go to score at this time?<eos> No, but it's easy to find out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Whoever you are... I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.<eos> I can't drive.<eos> Nina does the driving.
You're unlike the men I've known.<eos> I'll stay with you, teach you to stop being afraid.<eos> You have something special that touches and troubles me.<eos> But I'm not into long relationships.<eos> A long relationship can be senseless.<eos> It's the listless routine of the living dead who don't even know if they're living or dead.<eos> Don't fear the worst, enjoy the best.<eos> Maybe you're afraid of being dumped.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
The Rectum from Reykjavik!<eos> - That's not right, is it? - I don't know.<eos> She gets around.<eos> Eddie, assemble all the staff!<eos> - Here I am.<eos> - Good.<eos> Is this it?<eos> Where's Lardy Basto?<eos> - Chef left this morning, remember?<eos> - Damn, so he did!
We are fortunate that he may accept you as his disciple<eos> Yes, sir<eos> Give it to him<eos> It's cold.<eos> Put on your coat<eos> Thank you, mother<eos> This Red Sword is my family's heirloom<eos> I am handing it over to you now.<eos> Take it<eos> And do well in your training with Master
I can't decide for you. You decide.<eos> I can't decide.<eos> God's the one who decides.<eos> Who drew up this shooting?<eos> I can't strangle her! What am I supposed to do?<eos> We're not asking you to strangle her.<eos> What then?<eos> How much longer do we have to stay here?<eos> What if the event never occurs?<eos> And what if it does?
I think we can.<eos> We have to try to come to an understanding.<eos> - I don't understand you, sir.<eos> - I'm not a Jew.<eos> You're not Jewish?<eos> No.<eos> - Have you been christened?<eos> - I have no religion.<eos> Does that mean you don't believe in our one and only God?<eos> No, I don't.
Sahane passes over only when she wishes.<eos> She's my guest, you can't take her by force.<eos> We have both violated the borders of state!<eos> Don't lie to me!<eos> You have left your herd, and me my Adem.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> Sahane, Sahane!<eos> Melek, Sadiye, come here.<eos> Melek, I'm calling your mother, why doesn't she come?<eos> -She doesn't.
So all during that year when we first optioned from Fox they employed Cobb, and he was on a weekly salary, working on many designs.<eos> I found myself working with the English science-fiction illustrator Chris Foss and just turning out drawings in an old rehearsal hall above one of the old stages on the Fox lot for months and months and months.<eos> It was in some ways frustrating cos we just couldn"t sense a direction so I was suggesting things and Chris was as well, with talk of getting Giger involved.<eos> I had some correspondence with Giger - ...some letters and some telephone discussions with him.<eos> And I thought it through very carefully.<eos> I wanted to get the best value out of whatever association we had with Giger.<eos> And so I was very specific about what I asked him to design.<eos> And he said he will give me $1,000, if I design the "face hugger" for him.<eos> And he described me this egg, and it was a big egg and I thought in this big egg must be a big beast, ja?<eos> So I did quite a big alien face hugger.
Please. Don't let anyone know where I am.<eos> Until we know for sure.<eos> (footsteps)<eos> - They told me he's in the psychiatric unit.<eos> - I told you on the phone... No, you said that there was bad news.<eos> You didn't tell me what was wrong.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> It just took me three flights to get here.<eos> I don't know what to do, Dana.<eos> No one else does either.
"The surprise factor adds to the pleasure."<eos> Just as I thought I had my sexual esteem back, this is a disaster!<eos> I don't propositon the men, I don't date anybody from work.<eos> In fact, I have a rule against it.<eos> But you do dress to turn the guys on a little.<eos> I don't deny that.<eos> I like to feel attractive.<eos> And, truth be told, your "rule" about dating men at work... the word is, you kind of use that a little to make guys think:<eos> Ah, but for that rule, they might have a chance with you?<eos> Yes, I do that.
We just had so much in common.<eos> We were talking, and I suddenly thought, "This is the man I'll marry. "<eos> The very night you met him?<eos> My mom always says, "When it happens, you'll know. "<eos> This is embarrassing. I've always believed when I met the right man that our souls would connect, even before a single word was spoken.<eos> Objection.<eos> Sentimentality shouldn't go unpunished. Move for cause.<eos> - I think I'll overrule that.<eos> - Your mom told you about the souls?<eos> No. But he did.
If you love her as much as you say you do, what's not to try?<eos> She's willing to meet?<eos> Yes<eos> What time?<eos> Eight o'clock. Oh, here ...<eos> Ah, here's the address.<eos> Okay.<eos> Great!<eos> Good, I'll, I'll see you tonight.<eos> I did, I just, uh...
- Nelle, hi.<eos> Late for court?<eos> - Dinner tomorrow night?<eos> - Sure, that....<eos> Don't start playing hard to get.<eos> I might just give up and start going after Billy.<eos> Kidding.<eos> Just, you know, for my own education what exactly do you see in her?<eos> I married her because she's beautiful.<eos> - So do many men, Mr. Goodman.
And now there's pressure.<eos> I thought you were going out.<eos> We switched to lunch.<eos> If I don't nail this closing--<eos> Do you think it's significant that as I begin to date somebody that may be--<eos> My case says, "Don't trust passion because even when you think you've found love it's temporary, even after nine years because the statute of limitations never runs out on his right to rip you into shreds. " Do you think?<eos> You know, that's exactly what I've been stuck on.<eos> This woman thought she had it. She's a smart woman.<eos> - I thought I had it with Billy.<eos> - You did.
She made false representation.<eos> The victim relied on them to enormous financial and emotional detriment.<eos> Frauds don't get any bigger.<eos> It's time the law offered these victims some protection. It's time.<eos> Miss McBeal.<eos> She's being prosecuted for fraud.<eos> Because she married somebody who wasn't the man of her dreams.<eos> We'll have to build more prisons if we start arresting people for this.<eos> I suppose the real fraud is this mind set ingrained in us since childhood that people get the person of their dreams.<eos> Most don't.
- Thank you.<eos> Sorry I' m late. I got some wine.<eos> I thought you might not show. I was nervous you got afraid.<eos> Afraid of what?<eos> Men think if a woman invites him for dinner she just wants to sleep with him.<eos> Come on, take your coat off.<eos> John?<eos> - So that's not the case here?<eos> - Did you want it to be the case?<eos> Maybe I did.
- Miss Woo.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's not my nature to engage in post commentary but I'd appreciate you telling everyone what happened here.<eos> You sneaky, arrogant, bad-faith bastard.<eos> There 's no substitute in life for respect and kindness.<eos> This big dope thought he was exempt because he got enough idiots to vote for him.<eos> I' m not lit well.<eos> T o Ling and The Biscuit. We' re on a roll!<eos> - I told you I'd win, didn't I?<eos> - Yes, you did, Ling.
- He did kill a lot of people.<eos> - Mutilated their corpses.<eos> Plus, he started the bidding on me at a paltry $2000.<eos> This I framed for saving my life and as a reminder that something of Doyle's is here in our office.<eos> Well, I'll be off then.<eos> Farewell, Angel.<eos> Who knows when our paths will cross again.<eos> Wesley.<eos> - Do you know where you're headed?<eos> - Rogue demon hunters rarely do.
It was just my mom.<eos> She did the best she could.<eos> So you had to get tough right out of the gate. Shut down your emotions.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You have our permission to be honest.<eos> Is there something that you always wanted to say to your mother but never could?<eos> "Will you marry me?"<eos> Kate, you'd like to share something?<eos> We'd like to hear it.<eos> - No, I don't really.
Dirty.<eos> Like something sick creeped inside you and you can't get it out.<eos> And you hope it was just some nightmare, but it wasn't.<eos> - And we'll have to figure out...<eos> - Is there gonna be an intermission in this?<eos> Just let me talk to Giles.<eos> I swear...<eos> We're not bringing anybody else into this.<eos> Keep your head. This will blow over in a few days.<eos> And if it doesn't?
But then again, we have reality.<eos> I will kill you before I let you touch me.<eos> Faith, we need to get out of here.<eos> Now.<eos> Speak for yourself, B.<eos> Me? I like it here.<eos> One thing I learned about Buffy.<eos> She's so cute when she's sleeping.<eos> Hey, I know a way to make investigating the Mayor even more boring.<eos> - On second thought, no, I don't.
- You care.<eos> Yeah. Everybody cares.<eos> Nobody wants to be inconvenienced.<eos> You all want me to take the time and go through the pain,<eos> - as long as you don't have to hear about it.<eos> - Now that's not fair.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Cos I'm doing the best I can, and it doesn't seem to be enough for you guys.<eos> - And I see how you could feel that way.<eos> I do... - No, you don't.
See?<eos> We've got an extra set of chains.<eos> Eeuw!<eos> Just because Dorkus went in for that...<eos> - Dru-silla.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> - Say her name.<eos> - Dorkus.<eos> - Bite your tongue.<eos> - Do it for me.
No, I do. It's just the caffeine. It makes me jittery.<eos> - I understand Buffy spent the night. - I'm sorry about that.<eos> - We came back after patrolling...<eos> - I'm not interested in the details.<eos> OK.<eos> I'm here because I'm worried about you two, in general.<eos> What happened before, when I changed, it won't happen again.<eos> That's not all I'm concerned about.<eos> I don't have to tell you that you and Buffy are from different worlds.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm trying to do what's right. I'm trying to think with my head instead of my heart.<eos> Heart?<eos> You have a heart?<eos> It isn't even beating.<eos> - Don't. - Don't what?<eos> Don't love you?<eos> I'm sorry. You know what? I didn't know that I got a choice in that.<eos> I'm never gonna change. I can't change.<eos> I want my life to be with you.<eos> I don't.
But I'm not gonna let some subhuman ruin it for the rest of the senior class.<eos> - Let me help you.<eos> - I'm OK.<eos> - If you ever need my help...<eos> - Look, I got it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey. Don't forget your dress.<eos> Aren't you wearing it tonight?<eos> As much as I hate to admit it, I haven't finished paying for it yet.<eos> - Well, somebody did. - What? Who?
Go.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> What am I doing?<eos> Okay, you know this isn't fair because I love it when you...<eos> Prue, you scared me.<eos> - Where's Phoebe?<eos> - Upstairs.<eos> But you might wanna knock.<eos> Phoebe, we need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
Gave me away, huh?<eos> You have a beautiful smile, Phoebe.<eos> - How can you tell?<eos> - I can hear it in your voice.<eos> I can see it in my mind.<eos> - What's the matter, are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Brent, when they took you, were you wearing a sweatshirt with jeans and black high-tops?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I think I was.<eos> How did you...?
What should we do?<eos> - Kyle.<eos> - Leo, do something.<eos> Kyle, catch.<eos> Die!<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, this is a potion to induce sleep.<eos> This one is to repel an evil threat.<eos> And that one puts out a fire.<eos> - What kind of potion does that?
- All right.<eos> - That was close.<eos> - Too close.<eos> No, I don't mean her, I mean you.<eos> The paramedic said you almost died.<eos> Yeah, what else is new?<eos> We'd better figure out a way to get the book back from Abraxas.<eos> If we don't, we're dead.<eos> But how? We don't know where the astral plane is.<eos> Yes, we do.
Use the ceremonial kill-a-ma-gig.<eos> I'm a little tired right now.<eos> Can I just give them a savage beating?<eos> No!<eos> The elders have spoken.<eos> Show us the killing skills that made you a media darling.<eos> Do it! Kill them before they bring down our society!<eos> -Do it!<eos> -Do it!<eos> ALL: Do it!

No, I'm just assuming that because, you know, once you've been with a guy like Todd, I'm sure everyone after that would be a let-down.<eos> Am I right or wrong?<eos> Please tell me. I think my father wants to dance with me.<eos> All right. Hey, congratulations again.<eos> Todd and I were roommates at college.<eos> And, Paula, let me give you a little advice, hide your laundry money.<eos> But seriously, Todd and I have been through a lot together:<eos> Bio class, the big games, keg parties at Phi Delt. Todd never touched the stuff.<eos> Oh, excuse me, I ordered the steak.<eos> No, sir, you didn't.
Ah, so that's what this is all about.<eos> You just want to get to use their beach house.<eos> What, you just figured that out now?<eos> You haven't noticed that I--I've been skeet shooting a lot more than usual?<eos> Oh, come on, you guys.<eos> Help me out. I've been working very hard this year. I want a tan.<eos> Doug, tell him to do this.<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> Richie, go do it.<eos> But, moose-- do it!
Just get him back.<eos> - Jeannie, let's go back now.<eos> Peter Watts was here.<eos> Why would he kidnap a child?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I wouldn'tjump to that conclusion.<eos> We've got Millennium Group symbols all over the place, and Peter Watts sneaking around.<eos> What conclusion would you jump to?<eos> I never had reason to doubt your commitment before, Rachel.<eos> - You still don't.
To this day I still don't understand why they left each other.<eos> They separated?<eos> Catherine was his centre.<eos> He's never been the same.<eos> There was somebody who worked with Frank here, in the Millennium Group.<eos> - Peter Watts.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He was in Seattle during the outbreak.<eos> He survived the virus. His whole family did.<eos> So did Frank, so did Jordan.
Watch your brother, O'Reily, okay?<eos> You don't want him disqualified from the championship... 'cause he ended up in the hole.<eos> What the fuck were you thinking?<eos> When I fight, people cheer, right?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I like when they cheer.<eos> I'm not scared anymore.<eos> That's good, Cyril, but you don't have to fight all the time.<eos> - I don't? - No, you don't.<eos> But, Ryan, you do.
But that's crazy.<eos> That's all nonsense.<eos> That's nothing but a racket for the Jews!<eos> Dad goes.<eos> - He does not.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> - He does not.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> To a psychiatrist?<eos> He does not.
That's all nonsense.<eos> That's nothing but a racket for the Jews!<eos> Dad goes.<eos> - He does not.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> - He does not.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> To a psychiatrist?<eos> He does not.<eos> He does too.
-What do you know?<eos> He knows nothing.<eos> It was a carjacking!<eos> Now get out of here!<eos> You're upsetting my wife!<eos> In case you change your mind.<eos> -You know he's right.<eos> -Nothing will happen.<eos> Wake up, Tony!<eos> It already did!
Right there.<eos> The explosion began at the intercooler matrix.<eos> Your men should have planted the bomb at the secondary plasma relay.<eos> The ship was still destroyed.<eos> The intercooler was the obvious choice for sabotage.<eos> Their security could have found the bomb before the ship left orbit.<eos> - But they didn't.
But you look just like our Ezri, except you're a lot taller.<eos> What?<eos> She's exactly the same height!<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Don't be an idiot.<eos> I'm telling you they're identical. I think.<eos> Do I have to throw you off this transport pad?<eos> One thing's for sure, their personalities aren't identical.<eos> How do we know the Regent will keep his word and send Zek back?<eos> You don't.
Everything is going to be all right.<eos> You're safe with me.<eos> Still no response to our hails.<eos> I hate to ruin a good chase, but the Ba'Neth ship is moving out of the deflector's range.<eos> Seven, can you get their cloaking frequency?<eos> They're blocking our scans.<eos> We've lost them.<eos> They're gone now, Tuvok.<eos> I told you you'd be safe.<eos> Yes... you did.
We had to break free, so we worked together, and we finally escaped.<eos> We had our implants removed on lnavar Prime...<eos> But they couldn't break the neural link.<eos> We need to find out what happened eight years ago after the crash...<eos> The night we were reassimilated into the collective.<eos> We need to know how the link was created.<eos> But our memories are...<eos> Fragmented, disorganized.<eos> We hoped that you would know.<eos> I don't.
I will give you one minute!<eos> The reinforcements should come soon.<eos> We could detonate the C4.<eos> No, Trofsky is gonna start shooting any minute.<eos> We gotta buy some time.<eos> - He thinks I'm a Goa'uld, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Blow that C4 the minute the cavalry comes through that gate.<eos> - What if they don't?

Sort of a... "to whom it may concern"?<eos> (Ke'ra giggles)<eos> Sir?<eos> Oh...<eos> I was just thinking about amnesia.<eos> It doesn't quite track with Linea's nickname.<eos> - Destroyer of Worlds.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That one.<eos> Well, actually, in sort of a sick way, it does.
And these are friends of yours.<eos> They've come to take you home.<eos> - Do you know me?<eos> - We do, Ke'ra.<eos> We understand that you've lost your memory.<eos> Know that you are a great leader of our people, and you are most welcome.<eos> I sense we knew each other well before my memory was lost.<eos> Did we?<eos> No.<eos> No, we never really did.
But what if it were true?<eos> Good and evil, which would prevail?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Octavia. I'm gonna check myself out.<eos> - You'd like a day pass?<eos> - l won't be coming back.<eos> Who's there?<eos> - lt's me.<eos> - You came.<eos> I almost didn't.
Pills don't work.<eos> Razors, gas, bridges...<eos> I can't tell ya how many bridges I've jumped off of. All I get is wet.<eos> I got left behind.<eos> I don't want to be here any more.<eos> I can't even remember a time when I did.<eos> This is...<eos> This is all I know... to do.<eos> You know I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
You picked a bad time to come back, Faye.<eos> You're sure you didn't call them here?<eos> Yeah right, or maybe they followed you here?<eos> Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later.<eos> Wait!<eos> Faye: Hold on! Spike:<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> She said she'll be waiting there.<eos> She said you'd know what she meant.<eos> Well, I don't. Sorry.
You were the first girl I ever kissed.<eos> I knew that.<eos> Playing spin-the-bottle.<eos> Yep. And you stuck your tongue in my mouth.<eos> I didn't know you were supposed to do that.<eos> I was mortified.<eos> Thought you were an epileptic, so I went home and told Mama you had a seizure in my mouth.<eos> I was over the moon for you back then, Birdee.<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.
I never thought I'd like that, but I did... with him.<eos> Sure, you do.<eos> I miss his hands.<eos> I miss the way he would put them on the small of my back... and lead me into a room.<eos> It made me feel so safe.<eos> I miss all that.<eos> - Of course you do.<eos> You know, it's so easy to believe him, but you know what?<eos> I think it's me.<eos> I do, because...
Well, then, kiss your butt goodbye.<eos> - Max, Max, get up!<eos> - I'm stuck!<eos> The mud's too thick!<eos> - Whoa. - Is he all right?<eos> - Can't get through the mud!<eos> - Keep going! Help me, you assholes!<eos> Hey, you kids, stay right there, now.<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> - We didn't do nothing!
- It's John.<eos> What happened?<eos> The piece wasn't where I left it?<eos> It was there.<eos> I need a passport, can you help me?<eos> - Yeah, I'll call Bob.<eos> - No, he works for Wei.<eos> Everybody works for Wei.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wantsomeone who doesn't.
What he dreamed...<eos> Happened?<eos> It happened.<eos> You're telling me that because Harry went inside the Sphere, he now has the power to manifest his dreams, his fantasies...<eos> Manifest. He manifested it.<eos> He made it happen.<eos> We better not piss him off.<eos> It's not that different from a child, right?<eos> A child imagines that what it's imagining happens.<eos> But it doesn't.
- Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.<eos> Do you remember, Truman?<eos> You slept the whole way there.<eos> - It looks so small.<eos> - Things do, when you look back.<eos> Look, Truman. The happiest day of our lives.<eos> - Look!<eos> Jean, Jodie, Joanne...<eos> - Doesn't she look beautiful?<eos> Well, she still does.
That is, if you complete your chores in time, mind your manners till then.<eos> What's the matter with her?<eos> Oh...<eos> She doesn't want you to go.<eos> (Henry) Do you really think there is only one perfect mate?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> How can you be certain to find them?<eos> And if you find them, are they really the one for you or do you only think they are?<eos> What if the person you're meant to be with never appears?<eos> Or she does, but...
I figured I'd talk some sense into the guy.<eos> Next thing I know, he pulls into this warehouse with all these French wackos in military outfits.<eos> They wanna try to sneak back into the city tonight.<eos> They're going after the nest.<eos> If he finds it, I think you should be the one to let the whole world know that he was right all along.<eos> You want me to follow him into the city?<eos> Yeah, we both will.<eos> - Come on, it'll be fun, it'll be fun.<eos> - I already made a mess of everything.<eos> Yeah, you really did, Audrey.
He's a man.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> He'd take what he wants.<eos> So you'd sleep with him?<eos> Anne, would you?<eos> I want to talk about something else.<eos> Yeah, but this interests me, so tell me.<eos> You want to know?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> Yes I do.
-Do you have any soups?<eos> -We do, we do.<eos> Packed soups, ghoulash, beef, leek. I'll show you...<eos> French, pea, beef...<eos> -We should go after them.<eos> -I don't think so.<eos> I don't have her address or telephone number.<eos> If she wanted you to have it, she'd have given it to you.<eos> Sometimes girls forget to...<eos> No they don't.
Though I sometimes find that hard.<eos> We all fail at faith, Aramis.<eos> That's why we must eat, drink, and make love to life.<eos> As king, you can have a thousand ploughmaids.<eos> Porthos! You miss the point!<eos> What point?<eos> Phillippe is right.<eos> We haven't given him a reason to do what we ask.<eos> I understand your reason, Athos.<eos> You do?
- You have to look at this! Leo Pedranski worked for Kudrow.<eos> He wrote that letter.<eos> He was also killed after he wrote it.<eos> I ran it through the lab and the fingerprints on it are an exact match for his.<eos> Up.<eos> That's where we're goin', Simon.<eos> Come on.<eos> Is that you, Art?<eos> I'm a United States marshal with the Witness Protection Program.<eos> How do you do?
I know we were jerks to you before... so let's start over.<eos> Hi. I'm Ling.<eos> - And I'm Chien-Po.<eos> - Hello, Chien-Po. And I am Yao.<eos> King of the rock.<eos> And there's nothin' you girls can do about it.<eos> Well, I think Ping and I can take you.<eos> - I don't wanna take him anywhere.<eos> - Ping, we have to fight.<eos> No, we don't.
Shυt up' Mr. Blackwell.<eos> Get over here.<eos> - You Working?<eos> - Sort of.<eos> I was negotiating a trυce between my Wife and daughter.<eos> That might prove to be easy by comparison.<eos> It woυldn't sυrprise me in the least.<eos> - So yoυ shut off the heat already.<eos> - You know how this works, Danny.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Is this as fast as it goes?<eos> It takes a few minutes to warm up and then we ride like the wind.<eos> It's been a half hour and the wind is going faster than us.<eos> Actually, we're doing 85 right now.<eos> No, that's your clock, sir.<eos> It says 8:25.<eos> Don't mind that clock, it always breaks down.<eos> No offence, but do you really think we can make San Malina in two hours?<eos> - Who said that?<eos> - You did last night.
Or Glenn?<eos> CHINO: Mira, Adele, you in there?<eos> - Yes.<eos> -CHINO: Mira, I'd like to speak to you.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> -Emile, the guy you used to work for?<eos> He gave me your number and where you live.<eos> I'm looking for an assistant.<eos> Can I speak to you?<eos> You did work for Emile?
You asked me how many times I read your letter.<eos> I must've read it about 1000 times.<eos> It was your letter that brought me here.<eos> It was you.<eos> And I'm all mixed-up about that.<eos> The reason you're here and you don't know why is because I sent for you.<eos> When I was a little girl I worked a spell so I would never fall in love.<eos> I asked for qualities in a man that I knew couldn't possibly exist.<eos> One green eye, one blue?<eos> But you do.
You're saying what I'm feeling is just one of your spells?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not real.<eos> If you stay, I wouldn't know if it was because of the spell and you wouldn't know if it was because I didn't want to go to prison.<eos> You know, all relationships have problems.<eos> I'm right, aren't I?<eos> You don't know, do you?<eos> Why don't you do what you do and I do what I do and we'll see where we end up.<eos> Curses only have power when you believe in them.<eos> And I don't.
[Gasps] Moving bush.<eos> [Ayden chirps]<eos> Not now, Ayden.<eos> Look!<eos> Your falcon has silver wings.<eos> Really? I'll have to take your word for that.<eos> Oh, no. I'm sorry.<eos> KAYLEY:<eos> It means he knows where Excalibur is.<eos> Sure he does. In Camelot.
No one travels through the Forbidden Forest after dark.<eos> My father, Sir Lionel, would have.<eos> Come on, baby, light my fire.<eos> You know, there's nothing more pathetic than a flame-retarded dragon.<eos> Hey, Devon, you blew fire.<eos> No, no, my mistake.<eos> Just hot air.<eos> [Sticks twitter]<eos> Kayley, I must tell you, I knew your father.<eos> You did?
Who set us up?<eos> Was it you?<eos> Who set us up? Who was it?<eos> Was it you? Who set us up?<eos> I don't know what you mean!<eos> You don't think I'll kill you, a priest.<eos> You're seriously misjudging me!<eos> You want to kill me, you go ahead!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about!<eos> I don't.
They searched hacker homes in Hamburg.<eos> We were lucky we quit in time.<eos> I wasn't lucky.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I've had a tough time since...<eos> Sometimes it's like I'm driving down a winding road.<eos> suddenly, I feel I've no control.<eos> Someone else controls it.<eos> Maybe the illuminati don't exist.<eos> Maybe they never did.
Do you have kids?<eos> What's the deal?<eos> No. Dodged a few bullets.<eos> Yeah?<eos> God, this is just so... bizarre.<eos> I mean, I'm standing here with Mary Jensen.<eos> No, no.<eos> Now it's Mary Matthews.<eos> Oh.<eos> Did you...
I'm doin' your job for you and I damn near get my head blown off!<eos> Now I want Frank Junior out and I wanna see my prisoner - Tariq Husseini!<eos> Let's go see your prisoner.<eos> (Sharon speaking Arabic)<eos> - How long have you been at it?<eos> - Not long enough, apparently.<eos> How much longer before he gives up the other cells?<eos> - He can't, if he doesn't know where they are.<eos> - He knows.<eos> He doesn't.
Get up!<eos> - No!<eos> - Samir, let her go and you'll live.<eos> - Move away from this fuckin' door!<eos> - Don't! - Samir...<eos> - Hub, I'm here.<eos> No shots, Frank.<eos> Samir.<eos> - Do you wanna die?<eos> - Do you?
What for?<eos> I'll do the florist, you the bakery.<eos> Or vice versa.<eos> No, the wedding arrangements are up to me.<eos> And I'm leaving now.<eos> You're not ready.<eos> I'm fond of industrial architecture.<eos> I find that in this area it blends very well.<eos> The two stacks of the Tricastin power plant, they don't bother or shock me.<eos> They do me.
You see, in a way, I'm relieved:<eos> Something was fishy, but I couldn't figure it out.<eos> But I'm disappointed, too.<eos> Very much so.<eos> I was already more than interested in you.<eos> I don't want to shock you, but I wanted to love you, and I'm frustrated.<eos> OK, stop this nonsense.<eos> I'm suggesting you love someone who's very available.<eos> I can see why you're hurt, but if it works you won't have wasted your time.<eos> And if it doesn't?
Ok, um... don't tap it.<eos> Ok.<eos> All right.<eos> You really got me by the kinks. Absolutely.<eos> You're just saying that.<eos> No, it's true.<eos> We always know what the other one is thinking.<eos> You know what I'm thinking now, don't you, sis?<eos> Not really.<eos> Yes, you do.

He's gone and his wife is furious. She's in my room.<eos> Is the party still going strong?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They're all off to bed.<eos> Where are the glasses? Where is Michelle ?<eos> With Kim.<eos> Everybody sleeps in the wrong bed.<eos> Not us, ey darling ?<eos> We don't do that.
What happened?<eos> Selim...<eos> Good evening.<eos> Who let you in?<eos> It's forbidden, don't you know?<eos> A boy that cleans car windows on the streets was brought here...<eos> He was run over by a bus on the boulevard.<eos> I already told you it's forbidden.<eos> Listen, the coroner knows me.<eos> Does he?
- He was Jack...<eos> and he was Jake.<eos> And he had discovered there was a price to pay for this double life of his.<eos> He had no idea where Marion was staying, or with whom.<eos> He realized he knew little about her life, but then...<eos> He had never asked about it.<eos> For the first time in a long while, Jack thought about his mother.<eos> She'd left when she couldn't take it any more.<eos> His father had said, don't worry Jack, oh, she'll come back.<eos> She didn't.
Jack, hold on a minute, there's someone here who wants to talk to you.<eos> - Jacko. - Dad.<eos> - I never thanked you properly for your help.<eos> Jani tells me you behaved like the perfect gentleman.<eos> I knew you would, I know my son.<eos> The woman thinks I'm gonna marry her.<eos> But you know me.<eos> Well, it's a shame that things never worked out, but we saw you all right.<eos> You didn't gamble the ten grand, did you?<eos> - As a matter of fact, I did.
I saw you save that child.<eos> I don't know about our past... but now you can go.<eos> Please go home.<eos> Scream if you can't take it.<eos> Scream.<eos> Hey! Trying to kill someone?<eos> That's not a sword!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> But I do.
Please go home.<eos> Scream if you can't take it.<eos> Scream.<eos> Hey! Trying to kill someone?<eos> That's not a sword!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> But I do.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Nobody does.
No.<eos> Gopal, do you know who a true orphan is?<eos> Not the one without relatives... but the one who is alone despite having them.<eos> That is why I asked.<eos> Take some more curry.<eos> No, enough.<eos> There is a thief out there.<eos> Hide in darkness, and one day the dark will reveal you.<eos> People should trust each other.<eos> But we don't.
God please see that I don't fail in my exams this time as well I am a bit weak in Chemistry.<eos> Hey! look forward.<eos> So your relatives stay here?<eos> Yes here...here...here...<eos> So Rahul Khanna comes to the temple every Tuesday.<eos> Yes.<eos> - How sweet.<eos> Why did you lie at college then?<eos> Actually boys don't go to the temple. So!<eos> But you do...
Tell me frankly.<eos> It's been years, you're still talking about it.<eos> You brought home a couple o f shitty stools, that's all.<eos> - You're not supporting your husband.<eos> Support what, are you going to open the bar with two stools?<eos> - Stools are the main assets o f a bar.<eos> - To hell you will.<eos> He may open, he may close, he may go bankrupt.<eos> - What happened? - I'm leaving.<eos> Well done, Ay la.
Georgia, you and I will go see...<eos> Daddy.<eos> - This is insane!<eos> - Our job's distorting the law.<eos> - Should we bring a magazine?<eos> - You'll hand him Tupperware?<eos> Metal isn't allowed. Plastic is okay.<eos> Who gets to burp it?<eos> - Why does it bother you?<eos> - It doesn't.
Relax, relax.<eos> - She'll be in session a while.<eos> - I'll wait.<eos> - Hello, officer.<eos> - License and registration.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Wonder why I went down a one-way?<eos> - I was going one way.<eos> - Have you been drinking?<eos> No, I don't...
Billy.<eos> I am a very satisfied woman.<eos> - Don't you wish I was...<eos> - No!<eos> Of all the things to be insecure about, that is the least.<eos> Not what I meant.<eos> I am very, very happy in the bed.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth?<eos> - I do.
It's Christmas.<eos> My secretary says he's called six times in two hours.<eos> If a surgeon's hands shake, they can't keep him till he kills a patient.<eos> This man's mental acuity, his decision-making ability is vital to his job.<eos> This company deals with the life savings of many of its investors.<eos> They' re not entitled to take him from the game. It's their duty.<eos> A fiduciary duty to their shareholders who put their trust in T amarack Mosely.<eos> He's being fired not for anything he did but because of his belief in something supernatural.<eos> - Because he says he saw it.<eos> - Maybe he did.
- You suck on it?<eos> - Can I show you?<eos> You secreted, but I swallowed.<eos> No slobber.<eos> I need ice.<eos> It's irregular, but I'll let him ask a few questions.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dad.<eos> - Why do you say you love her?<eos> - Maybe because I do.
He still loves his wife.<eos> He wants to continue experiencing it.<eos> We are lucky to have somebody with a bit of that insanity.<eos> Somebody who never lets you go.<eos> Somebody who cherishes you forever.<eos> Talk about a legacy.<eos> Loving somebody forever.<eos> That's a legacy.<eos> You want his world to go on, Sam.<eos> So does he.
Good sense of humor.<eos> Good father.<eos> Good sex.<eos> Yes.<eos> But what if we don't really have anything to talk about?<eos> All right, I know that you have this great idealism about marriage, but...<eos> - And please don't shoot the messenger.<eos> - What?<eos> Married couples, they don't talk.<eos> - They don't?
Not at all.<eos> I don't understand it.<eos> In spite of it all, I always thought at the end of the day we were on the same side.<eos> They just needed someone to explain it to them so they'd understand who the real enemy was.<eos> You mean us.<eos> The mundanes.<eos> We weren't supposed to fight each other.<eos> Not like this.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I truly don't.
The world's full of people you don't know.<eos> I worry about that all the time.<eos> Tough. Get over it.<eos> What else?<eos> Why were you so chummy with Bester?<eos> I was stationed at an Earthforce base near a mining company a few years ago.<eos> A rogue telepath was messing with my people.<eos> First, cheating them in the casino and later he killed two of them because they found out what he was.<eos> We couldn't find him.<eos> Bester did.
What more is there?<eos> - A word.<eos> - What word?<eos> Why won't you tell me?<eos> If that is all I need, just a word, why won't you tell me?<eos> If you will not tell me, why am I here?<eos> What is this place?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
And you fall for it every single time!<eos> Enough!<eos> Look at me, dearie.<eos> Be... in my eyes.<eos> Be in me.<eos> Night-night.<eos> Let's get what we came for, dears.<eos> Bottom line is, even if you see 'em comin.... ..you're not ready for the big moments,<eos> No one asks for their life to change, not really,<eos> But it does,
And anyways, love isn't always like that.<eos> Love can be... nice.<eos> Come back here!<eos> We're not finished!<eos> - You don't care any more, is that it?<eos> - It doesn't matter what I feel!<eos> Then tell me you don't love me. Say it!<eos> Will that help?<eos> Is that what you need to hear?<eos> I don't.
- I know... but...<eos> But it's over.<eos> It has to be.<eos> Come back here!<eos> We're not finished yet!<eos> - You don't care any more? Is that it?<eos> - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter what I feel.<eos> - Then tell me you don't love me. Say it!<eos> Will that help?<eos> I don't.

I've gotta tell her something.<eos> Giles, Angel has access to my house and I'm not always there. - I can't protect her.<eos> - I told you, I will find a spell.<eos> - What about until you find a spell?<eos> - You are welcome to ride with me in my car.<eos> Buffy, I understand your concern, but it's imperative that you keep a level head.<eos> That's easy for you to say.<eos> You don't have Angel lurking in your bedroom.<eos> I know how hard this is for you.<eos> OK, I don't.
Without even considering her, I inserted a surgical tool and began a tracheotomy.<eos> Then... Then I saw her.<eos> Her teeth yellowed, surrounded by chapped, parched lips.<eos> She stared up at me with eyeballs sunken in their sockets.<eos> And those eyes spoke.<eos> Her eyes did.<eos> Begging "Let me go. "<eos> And did you?<eos> She found the other plane.<eos> And so did I.
I recorded the whole interrogation.<eos> You know me?<eos> How'd you make sense of what she said?<eos> You speak English.<eos> I heard what I wanted to hear.<eos> She was sent here to tempt me with a question about...<eos> - About the Millennium Group?<eos> - About my life.<eos> And I didn't know until this moment that she didn't have the answer.<eos> Do you?
She's posted hundreds of messages in every conceivable newsgroup.<eos> Must have been online hundreds of hours.<eos> My kinda woman.<eos> A real net chick.<eos> is there a user profile?<eos> Female, 26.<eos> Librarian at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.<eos> - She's the victim.<eos> - Just because she uses the computer?<eos> No. Because he does.
- Aye, Captain.<eos> This way, sir.<eos> - Preliminary damage report, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Ensign Nog, Commander Karen Farris, our first officer.<eos> - Commander.<eos> - Ensign.<eos> The engine room reports that we have power spikes cropping up all through the start-up routine.<eos> - l thought we had that under control.<eos> - l did too.
It's a warning.<eos> Or so your vision foretells.<eos> No!<eos> It wasn't a vision, or a dream, or a hallucination.<eos> It was... real.<eos> I know this is hard for you to believe but the entire time you thought I had disappeared on P3R-233 I was experiencing an alternate reality.<eos> And you were there and you were there, and there's no place like home.<eos> As a matter of fact, you were there!<eos> Daniel, it's not that we don't believe you...<eos> - So you do? - No!
I'll be right there.<eos> You know, in some galaxies, this is called "loitering".<eos> How long do you think we can keep it up?<eos> Martouf.<eos> I do not know this woman.<eos> But I'm right, aren't I?<eos> Your name is Martouf.<eos> It is.<eos> - How do you know me?<eos> - I don't.
Known for some radical ideas.<eos> Right now I want to know how you came through my Stargate.<eos> How I...<eos> Your Stargate?<eos> What the hell is going on here, Catherine?<eos> I'd prefer you address me as Dr Langford.<eos> You were wearing a remote device.<eos> You had SG-1's code.<eos> How did you obtain it?<eos> How did I...?
Come on.<eos> Come on...<eos> - (rumbling) - (gasps)<eos> Oh!<eos> Gairwyn!<eos> Just... Just slide across.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Thor shook the beam!<eos> He wants me dead!<eos> - No, he doesn't!
Secara, Bareeth, Tira, very, very sad.<eos> We could not repair Hubald, creator of all this! His secrets were lost.<eos> But many survived...for awhile.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Some left through the ring we discovered. The ring, which you went through.<eos> They carried along small, more portable sources with them.<eos> I expected them to come home, I waited.<eos> This is home, after all.<eos> But they...didn't.<eos> And the rest did not except the gift,...
I mean, though you were drugged, you were more or less unharmed.<eos> Mulder?<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Who's the black private dick who's a sex machine with all the chicks?<eos> Shaft<eos> Can ya dig it?<eos> They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother...<eos> Shut your mouth.<eos> Talkin' 'bout Shaft.<eos> I did not.
Well, as I said, he was proud.<eos> I guess he felt that it was his brush with greatness.<eos> Is it possible that he mentioned you to Robert IVIodell?<eos> No, I sincerely doubt it.<eos> - We were only married two months.<eos> - How long did you know him?<eos> It was two months and two days.<eos> Why wait when it's true love?<eos> - You never know how long you have.<eos> - No, you don't.
Now, if somebody's trying to bury this case, I'd like to know why.<eos> Edward Skur disappeared 38 years ago, before you had a chance to arrest him for a series of stranger killings in which the victims' internal organs had been removed.<eos> - And now you've found him?<eos> - Yes, last week.<eos> Shot to death during an eviction.<eos> A man was also found in his bathroom with all his soft tissue removed.<eos> Well, if he's dead, there's nothing you need from me.<eos> Sir, my name is Mulder.<eos> You know that name.<eos> And so did Edward Skur.
That is why I need your help.<eos> Mr. Cliff.<eos> I don't let anyone in my sights get away and my bullets never miss their mark.<eos> Especially if it's the heart of a beautiful lady.<eos> Bang!<eos> Ma'am!<eos> Mr. Vash.<eos> A lot of people say that!<eos> I see.<eos> Do they now?
But it's not over yet.<eos> The show must go on.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Don't struggle.<eos> My 'la'! I've lost my 'la'!<eos> The show's over.<eos> You were trying for a ricochet all along!<eos> But it's too soon for the curtain call.<eos> the fate of the dying.<eos> Don't!
It's your maths teacher.<eos> Come in.<eos> There's usually a chair but it's a bad day.<eos> Because the bailiff is coming.<eos> We only owe 3000 francs but we played safe and took everything out.<eos> That's why this competition is a problem. It sure is!<eos> You can be proud of her though, us too.<eos> Top in maths in France.<eos> Leave us alone.<eos> But 3 days in Brussels, I don't...
I have the deepest respect for you.<eos> I'm sorry to have to do this.<eos> I promise you, none of this will make my highlight reel.<eos> Well, I hoped I could satisfy her.<eos> But, you know...<eos> ... shehadneeds.<eos> She didn't want to go behind my back.<eos> She suggested the chair.<eos> She hoped I might get to like sitting there.<eos> I didn't.
Not livestock.<eos> Did Christ hire a lawyer to get him off on technicalities?<eos> He went to the cross, nobly.<eos> You know why?<eos> To make a statement.<eos> To make a statement, as must we.<eos> But Christ lost.<eos> - You, I think... - No, sir, he did not.<eos> Or, at least you, Mr. Joadson, want to win, don't you?<eos> - Yes. - I certainly do.
Project Vulcan Cheeky, huh?<eos> Come on, baby, give it to me.<eos> You seem surprised to see me, Miss Fagina.<eos> What do you want...<eos> Mr. Cunningham, was it?<eos> Please . Call me Richee<eos> Miss Fagina . Your boss, Number Two...<eos> I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't, baby.
Or as you.<eos> Or as me.<eos> But with a little bit more up here.<eos> Or as Marie.<eos> At least then we can be reunited. Play just like before. "'Bandits' Outsmart Detectives"<eos> They're gone.<eos> I'm 1 00% sure.<eos> They're not gone. "We were here." I can't believe it.<eos> We haven't heard from them in ages.<eos> And we always did before.
No, I don't.<eos> Everyone misses it.<eos> - Everyone in the camp.<eos> No.<eos> Come on, no one can hear us.<eos> You're not a yellow star with me, remember?<eos> I don't want....<eos> What?<eos> To miss it.<eos> But do you?
- Yes. - Do you feel my mouth?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Do you feel my cock?<eos> - Do you feel?<eos> - Do you feel?<eos> - Mouth.<eos> - Cock.<eos> - Do you feel my cock?<eos> - Do you feel my mouth?<eos> Yes. Do you....
-Move the cars.<eos> -Give me hamlet.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> You get me instead.<eos> How noble. willing to sacrifice yourself for your friends.<eos> What can I say? Friendship runs deep.<eos> -Now, move the goddamn cars.<eos> -I guess I overestimated your intelligence.<eos> You didn't actually think I was going to let that bus leave, did you?<eos> actually, I didn't.
Fuck.<eos> You look good.<eos> You ready?<eos> You ready?<eos> Come on.<eos> I am a star.<eos> I'm a fucking rock 'n' roll star, man.<eos> My cock can get hard.<eos> Come on. Fuck.<eos> Please don't do this to me.
Take a big whiff.<eos> ALL rise!<eos> The Honorable Armand Poe presiding.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> ALL right, Mr. Lomax you may present your case.<eos> Mr. Lomax....<eos> I call Melissa Black.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Why is it too soon?<eos> A man without a gun is not a man?<eos> First religious rite, then rite of passage.<eos> The baptism of gun fire.<eos> Jerry, don't.<eos> Shit, did you see that?<eos> You like her.<eos> N-No.<eos> You don't?<eos> Do you or don't you?
This one is Mosquito, the edgy sniffer.<eos> - So that's the priest, right? - Yeah...<eos> Let me tell you one thing, watch out for Mosquito, he's trigger happy.<eos> Do you ladies still jerk off on shop-lifters?<eos> Not everyone gets to torture fifteen-year-old pushers.<eos> Strange, my hands smell like meat.<eos> This is the famous Dobermann?<eos> He is the famous Dobermann.<eos> He looks like a junkie.<eos> They all do.
I don't give a fuck about no legend.<eos> - Hey, Manu!<eos> - What?<eos> - Don't sell it.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Mean it!<eos> Don't sell it!<eos> Come over here.<eos> Did you think about me?<eos> I always do, champ.
I'm saying I wish I could.<eos> You wish?<eos> A guy like you doesn't touch a made guy.<eos> You know what I did yesterday?<eos> I went in front of all the skippers.<eos> That cocksucker Sonny Red, all of them.<eos> I went on the record with you.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> I think I do.<eos> You do?
Justin, prep those tanks. Yes, sir.<eos> Mr Cooper. lon drive in 10 minutes.<eos> Ooh, time to play "spam-in-the-can".<eos> - Skipper!<eos> - Peters.<eos> Captain Miller, I just wanted to say that...<eos> The clock is ticking, Doctor.<eos> Waiting for a personal invitation, Mr Smith?<eos> - No, sir!<eos> - Captain, I don't...
This was different.<eos> She's right.<eos> This... this was real.<eos> I felt...<eos> I felt heat.<eos> This is not something that's in our heads.<eos> Smitty, have you seen anything unusual at all?<eos> No, I haven't seen anything, and I don't need to see anything, sir, but this ship is fucked.<eos> Well, thank you, Mr Smith.<eos> Yeah, you don't...
We can't open the door.<eos> - I'll get the kit.<eos> - Justin, open the door!<eos> Justin, open the door.<eos> Did you hear it?<eos> - Keep him talking.<eos> - Yes, I heard it.<eos> What is it?<eos> It shows you things... horrible things.<eos> What does?
- Alexander T. Hope?<eos> - Do you have the money?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Let me talk to my daughter.<eos> Follow directions and stick to the plan.<eos> Am I clear?<eos> - A barge is approaching the bridge.<eos> Go to the centre of the bridge and throw the case on the barge.<eos> - How do I know you'll release her?<eos> - You don't.
I work on that one over there.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Have a nice life, guys.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> Have you got a minute?<eos> I've got to get back to work.<eos> Call me, we can get together.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> - And you think Max sent it?<eos> - Barry does.
I tried to get rid of them, but they insisted it was their room.<eos> Eva got really upset.<eos> Yes. They insisted it was their room?<eos> Room?<eos> What interests did she have?<eos> Who did she associate with?<eos> Who did she want to associate with?<eos> Which teachers did she like and dislike?<eos> Which boys did she like?<eos> Or maybe she didn't like?
There were crows.<eos> I just remembered. There were crows.<eos> When?<eos> The morning Lhamo was born.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> You were sick, and I brought him to you.<eos> You said, "We'll call him Lhamo," and you went to pray.<eos> I slept and later went outside and saw them.<eos> A pair of crows had come to nest on our roof as if they had come for Lhamo.<eos> Just as they did for the Dalai Lama.
It's like they have their own little world together.<eos> The gipper and I have that too!<eos> I know, but it's different.<eos> How?<eos> Well...<eos> He does the claw.<eos> The what?<eos> The claw.<eos> You know, it's like this...<eos> I don't...
And nicer.<eos> Fine.<eos> Set it up, newsboy.<eos> Sam, I' m on your side.<eos> After the interview ...<eos> ... youandIwillendit.<eos> You lost the exclusive.<eos> No, I didn't. I did not lose it.<eos> -Made us look preposterous.<eos> -I didn't.
- I'll buy you a diamond.<eos> - Give me some.<eos> - I'm not giving you shit.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> You know I'm straight.<eos> So am I.<eos> Straight to my house.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear the evidence you're about to give is the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
-I asked--<eos> -She admits that it's her fault.<eos> Totally, completely, inexcusably her fault.<eos> Think she still loves me?<eos> Love....<eos> It's a strong word, and I don't know that I'm necessarily qualified--<eos> I wouldn't be totally off base if I said that in her way...<eos> -...she does possess strong feelings--<eos> -Jules!<eos> Sure she does, Michael.
Tell me how to escape after killing that Thai guy?<eos> Should I stay to be shot by his fellow, or should I fly?<eos> You can fly, but I can't.<eos> Calling control, the maniac is now on the roof.<eos> Send us two guys to back up, over.<eos> I want twenty thousand more.<eos> If you don't pay me, you'd better do it yourself.<eos> What kind of gun have you prepared for me?<eos> I want a magnum.<eos> If no, then do it yourself.
So you're a friend of...<eos> Odile.<eos> I'm one of her colleagues from work.<eos> Just a notch above her but well... that doesn't matter, we get on well.<eos> A notch above, though...<eos> What do you do?<eos> I write plays for the radio.<eos> There's no such thing now!<eos> I mean, I thought they stopped years ago.<eos> Do people still do radio plays?
And I understand you're a somewhat abnormal person with a somewhat abnormal job. That I can accept.<eos> I deal with abnormality every single day.<eos> I don't need everything in my life to be normal.<eos> And on the air, you do what you do. That's your job. But off the air, for me to be in this marriage...<eos> I need to know I'm the only one. And I'm not saying that to pressure you.<eos> I'm saying it because it's just something I know about myself.<eos> So... if you need more time or whatever...<eos> I don't need any more time.<eos> I am just so madly in love with you.<eos> I don't...
If this young man has passed the bar, let him argue the case.<eos> We welcome him to big-time litigation.<eos> You have no objection?<eos> I would be honoured to introduce him to the practice of law in Tennessee.<eos> You can give him the oath right now. I'll be pleased to stand for him.<eos> Are you certain you're prepared to proceed?<eos> Yes, Your Honour.<eos> Very well, raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will support the constitution of the United States faithfully, and conduct yourself to the best of your abilities, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Any questions?<eos> Please?<eos> I have, Dr. Russell.<eos> Can you explain the actual process of fusion... you know, the theory?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, there it is.<eos> This is the-the apparatus.<eos> And very simply... when positively charged deuterons... are attracted to the palladium cathode... they cram together... and there are millions of them inside the cathode... getting closer and closer, and then they fuse... and they create energy in the form of helium.<eos> But I read somewhere... that the experiment couldn't be replicated... so how do we know it works?<eos> We don't.
Yeah ? What's your mother say ?<eos> Stop that !<eos> Stop it !<eos> Guys, what you did to me is unbelievable.<eos> You're right, there was a time I'd be lookin' at four dead bodies by now.<eos> But, strange as it seems, I understand what you're doin' and why you're doin' it.<eos> So I'm gonna offer you an opportunity.<eos> Get out of this.<eos> Before it gets so fucked up nobody could ever recover. Understand what I'm sayin' ?<eos> Yes, you do.
Come on, Max.<eos> Say "i'm sorry." that's all.<eos> Say "i am sorry."<eos> Come on, Max.<eos> Say you're sorry !<eos> Tell 'im, Max.<eos> Tell 'im !<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Motherfucker ! t.k., bring your bag over here !<eos> now ! do it !
That's right.<eos> Well, if he knew magic, if he could get the kids into the mountain, why couldn't he use his magic pipe... to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?<eos> Because... he wanted them to be punished.<eos> So he was mean?<eos> No, not mean.<eos> Just... just very... very angry.<eos> Should I keep reading?<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Tomorrow I'm gonna put Sean on the bus, and he won't want to go.<eos> He never does.
You can't throw 20 spadefuls of earth in that hole?<eos> Right now, I really need you, otherwise I wouldn't have begged you...<eos> You want me to beg you?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> No, why would you beg me?<eos> What does "need" mean?<eos> What does "help" mean?<eos> Don't you need money?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Of course I do...
That garbage man who came by the other day.<eos> Do you know why I was in prison?<eos> I killed my wife.<eos> That was a lie, about us being divorced.<eos> I stabbed her to death.<eos> I'm a murderer.<eos> I tried to forget, but these hands can't.<eos> The blade slashing her flesh... Stabbing deep into her body.<eos> How could I forget?<eos> Why did you do it?
It won't.<eos> Would you trust me?<eos> It is going to flow that way.<eos> Now everybody just grab some stretchers.<eos> Let's save as many lives as we possibly can, okay?<eos> There's a couple of thousand patients. They're doing surgery in the street.<eos> We can't possibly save everybody.<eos> Oh, I know that.<eos> I sent them all over there along with my daughter.<eos> I don't...
Only a one-word difference.<eos> -Has he been in jail long?<eos> -12 years.<eos> Does he have much longer to serve?<eos> What did he do?<eos> He raped a nun.<eos> -And...<eos> -l don't want to know an "and." Why is there an "and"?<eos> He's fine as long as he gets his medications.<eos> And if he doesn't?
What do you say to that?<eos> We say no.<eos> We want 1 20 marks.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Biberti.<eos> Robert Biberti.<eos> I represent the financial interests of the group.<eos> That's right.<eos> - Mr. Biberti represents our interests.<eos> - Then he does a poor job of it.
- I really thought we'd win.<eos> - Marriages should be twos, not threes.<eos> We thought you'd handle the appeal.<eos> - I'm sorry if I seemed a lunatic.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> The truth is that I use him.<eos> - What?<eos> - Billy.<eos> When I feel insecure or unsteady I grab ahold of things that steady me.<eos> - Billy does that.
Did I know him?<eos> Maybe I never really knew him.<eos> Look, you don't have to tell me anything.<eos> It's just that I'm left here... ... holdingnothingbutmymemories.<eos> I don't even know if my memories are true.<eos> I'll-<eos> - I'll um--<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> She knows.<eos> She does?
I came in because I could smell the denim.<eos> All that from one pair?<eos> -That's why.<eos> -Denim doesn't smell.<eos> Fine.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Richard said denim smells.<eos> It doesn't, does it?<eos> No. No, it doesn't.
Scanners turned up something suspicious in those crates.<eos> We went to take a look, and they got in our way.<eos> - Explosives?<eos> - The scanners say no.<eos> It could be weapons, contrabands, dust.<eos> - Well, then, let's open them up.<eos> - Hey, that's private property. - We've got rights. - You're gonna have my foot 16 inches up your butt if you don't get the hell out of my way.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> I'm gonna file a report with your superior officer.<eos> Well, you do that, sunshine.
You'll provide cover, allowing them to escape.<eos> Your ship has the only copy of this file.<eos> Ericsson, billions of lives are counting on this.<eos> - If there were any other way...<eos> - Understood.<eos> We'll put up a good fight.<eos> If there's anything that you or your crew need anyone you want us to get ahold of...<eos> They're Minbari, captain.<eos> They knew what they were signing on for.<eos> So did I.
It's sick, brutal, and it harms the innocent.<eos> And we all know you are the champion of innocence... ..and all things pure and good, Rupert.<eos> It's quite a little act you've got here.<eos> It's no act.<eos> It's who I am.<eos> Who you are?<eos> The Watcher? Snivelling, tweed-clad guardian of the Slayer and her kin?<eos> I think not.<eos> I know who you are, Rupert, and I know what you're capable of.<eos> But they don't, do they?
The Anointed One?<eos> He's dead.<eos> - Someone's dead?<eos> - Who is this monk?<eos> Brother Luca something.<eos> Keeps sending out global mailings about a prophecy.<eos> - Talk to him.<eos> Find out everything he knows.<eos> - You haven't told me jack, so why the order?<eos> Just do it!
Tell me my fortune!<eos> You're so useful, sitting here with all your books!<eos> You're really a lot of help!<eos> No, I don't suppose I am.<eos> - I know this is hard.<eos> - What do you know about this?<eos> You're never gonna die.<eos> Do you think I want anything to happen to you?<eos> We just gotta figure out a way...<eos> I already did.
- We have to warn them.<eos> No, we'll go.<eos> You have to concentrate on demon killing.<eos> - My car's in the lot. - Stay close together.<eos> And be careful.<eos> We will.<eos> For someone who's all-powerful, you sure do like to hide.<eos> I'm waiting for you.<eos> I want this moment to last.<eos> Well, I don't.
I know there's something wrong with me.<eos> I think it's getting worse.<eos> But I can't stand around waiting for Buffy to decide it's time to punch me out again.<eos> Look, I want you to help me.<eos> I want you.<eos> - I am helping you.<eos> - You're doing what you're told.<eos> Buffy's trying to help you, too.<eos> You know that.<eos> - Or Xander does.
I saw Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish.<eos> He said you played here a lot, so...<eos> I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> If "big-fish place" comes up again I'd like to know if that's several big fish or just one big fish.<eos> So Phoebe says you write jingles.<eos> Actually, I said she abandoned me to write jingles.<eos> Anything we might've heard of?<eos> Home is never far away<eos> Home is Homestar Stew.<eos> But I don't do that anymore.
Shut up, Harry!<eos> Do you install those automated-home systems?<eos> I install those all the time. I can automate anything my customers want.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What if I wanted to flush my toilet from the car?<eos> Then you'd be a strange, strange man.<eos> You should have him automate your house.<eos> Hey! Don't start, Delores!<eos> Tim doesn't like to be pushed into buying things.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> But now came the problem.<eos> The gun was put in his hand to suggest suicide, a hand we all know was incapable of squeezing the trigger.<eos> The conclusion is that the killer didn't know about Jack's arthritis.<eos> You were right.<eos> L was wrong.<eos> L believed in Alan Rokesmith.<eos> His sister did.
You mean, as in...<eos> Vixen.<eos> So that's how the CEOs vanished?<eos> Vixen just whisked them away?<eos> Well, why would she do that, unless...?<eos> She treats embezzlers like she treats every other criminal.<eos> Which means she is taking the law into her own hands.<eos> I have to stop her before she hurts anyone else.<eos> - How do you know where to look?<eos> - I don't.
Hi, this is Sam Lane.<eos> I'm not in right now, so if you'll...<eos> - Calling your father?<eos> - No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Just to say hi.<eos> He said he couldn't see me last night.<eos> He was working.<eos> - He said he was working for you.<eos> - He did?
- Mr Black, I take responsibility.<eos> A man makes a mistake, he should pay.<eos> I was a peace officer for 17 years.<eos> If I arrested somebody who did this, I would have fought like hell to have them executed, because that's what would have been right.<eos> You want to tell me why you did it?<eos> I thought about it for a long time.<eos> I fantasized about it.<eos> Do you have a wife and family?<eos> - Then you know what I'm talking about.<eos> - No. I don't.
- Would you like some water?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> There are others.<eos> There will be more deaths.<eos> - Are you mocking me?<eos> - No.<eos> There is someone out there who believes in May 5.<eos> He's responsible for the death of two girls already.<eos> I need to know who else believes in Earth changes.<eos> - Einstein did.
- Is he down here?<eos> - Jordan.<eos> - What?<eos> - Jordan is down here.<eos> There.<eos> She's dead.<eos> She's home.<eos> She's safe.<eos> You think you know me, Frank.<eos> But you don't them.
I can't sleep.<eos> The house is empty.<eos> - You told your wife about the affair?<eos> - She left me this morning.<eos> Kidnapper sent me something earlier this evening.<eos> A paint swatch.<eos> - Does that mean anything to you?<eos> - No. Should it?<eos> In all likelihood, it was a message he intended me to understand.<eos> - But you don't?
I take it you're not gonna watch the execution?<eos> How about you?<eos> No.<eos> Can't stand watching flowers die, let alone another human being.<eos> Closest I ever came was Bambi.<eos> - Bambi?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My ex was a big hunter.<eos> He was always going off with his buddies, so I said to him one time, "Take me."<eos> After some complaining, he did.
Forget it.<eos> Forget I said anything.<eos> There is a tooth that's rotted out.<eos> So we're going to have to pull it.<eos> That means I have to take a needle, inject some Novocaine in your mouth.<eos> - I hate needles.<eos> - Everybody does.<eos> - Then I have to drill.<eos> - I hate drills.<eos> Right now, so do I.
Computer.<eos> Time. 1821 hours.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I think so.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Where is what? I don't even know what you're looking for.<eos> Yes, you do.
Odo plays Nigel Dunlap a former agent who comes out of retirement to help me foil this diabolical plot.<eos> Perfect.<eos> And I play...<eos> Julian, we know who you play.<eos> What about me?<eos> Well, you're Falcon, of course.<eos> Falcon?<eos> Again?<eos> I'm tired of being the bad guy.<eos> But you do it so well.
Well...no. I did.<eos> Then it's certainly just as bad as it sounds.<eos> It was not my decision. It was Jake's choice to stay behind.<eos> So now you're going to blame this on Jake.<eos> I'm not blaming Jake.<eos> He's not a child.<eos> - He's responsible for his own actions.<eos> - l don't care.<eos> It's wrong and I want him back.<eos> And so do I.
Nerys. I dropped by your office and Damar told me you were here with her.<eos> She was here, but she's gone now.<eos> You all right?<eos> What did she want?<eos> She didn't want anything.<eos> Then what was she doing here?<eos> I know how you feel about her, Major but there's no reason to be concerned.<eos> You don't know how much I wish I could believe that.<eos> You didn't link with her, did you?<eos> Actually, I did.
I'm not saying that it won't be hard at first but they will have good lives here, happy lives.<eos> What about Kira? If we don't get her back to the station, she'll die.<eos> Is one life too much to ask if it saves 8,000?<eos> Who are you to decide who lives or dies? Who are you to make that call?<eos> !<eos> I have to make that call because I'm responsible for what happened here.<eos> Jadzia knows what I'm talking about.<eos> She's the one who insisted that the Defiant investigate this planet.<eos> You know as well as I do that you should have been more careful... you should have seen that the barrier was unstable when you scanned it.<eos> But I didn't.
Ah... are we glad to see you. Could one of you point us in the direction of the wormhole?<eos> I'm telling you, he knows exactly who I am.<eos> Kirayoshi already recognizes me. Nerys, the O'Brien's baby is less than a month old.<eos> He doesn't recognize his own fingers. He spent seven months inside my belly listening to my heartbeat hearing my voice.<eos> There's a connection there.<eos> Every time I walk into the room, he smiles.<eos> It's probably gas.<eos> Thanks. You always know just the right thing to say.<eos> How's my baby boy? He recognized me.<eos> Did he?
- Hi.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> - lt's a party.<eos> I need to get to work.<eos> I didn't mean to... lt's just that I need to get this coupling replaced.<eos> - What did you do, Chief?<eos> - Nothing!<eos> - What's the matter, Patrick?<eos> - He doesn't like me.<eos> Sure I do.
Do you, Chief?<eos> - He's jealous.<eos> - His wife's away.<eos> He misses his friend.<eos> - l do not.<eos> - lt's all right, Julian.<eos> - Go play with your friend. We'll be fine.<eos> - You want me to play with you, Chief?<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes, you do.
Nerys.<eos> Your father.<eos> He died calling your name.<eos> Get another raiding party together.<eos> I want to hit those Cardassians again as soon as we have a chance.<eos> Would you, uh, like me to call everyone together?<eos> Have Prylar Quen say a few words.<eos> There's nothing left to say.<eos> I didn't think you would come.<eos> Well, for a while there, neither did I.
And one day, Mr. VuIcan, I'II get you to trust your gut.<eos> That is doubtful.<eos> We'II see.<eos> Your attempts have yet to succeed.<eos> You always have to get in that last word, don't you?<eos> I am simply responding to your erroneous statement.<eos> Something tells me you just hate to lose an argument.<eos> Losing is irrelevant.<eos> See what I mean?<eos> I do not.
We lived here for a long time.<eos> My father did experiments.<eos> They were very important and we had to travel a long way.<eos> I had my birthday here.<eos> My cake had six candles on it and... and one more to grow on.<eos> And then the men came.<eos> Papa tried to fight them, but they were too strong.<eos> I tried to hide.<eos> Maybe they wouldn't find me because I was little.<eos> But they did.
is he gone or isn't he?<eos> You saw it happen.<eos> Somebody wanna tell me what's goin' on?<eos> Cos I'm startin' to lose it.<eos> (Hammond) Doctor?<eos> There seems to be some question in their minds as to whether Dr Jackson is dead.<eos> You were the only witnesses.<eos> If you deny what you saw...<eos> No, sir. I saw him die.<eos> We all did.
Alright, look, ...umm, do you have any elders, I could speak with...<eos> I don't think your understanding what I'm...<eos> Ohper is one of the oldest of the Nox.<eos> If Shak'I dose not die, ...they will be in even greeted danger then they are now.<eos> There will be no more death.<eos> I have no intention of killing him.<eos> However, if Shak'I dose survive his injuries he will tell the Goa'uld where to find you.<eos> Look, obviously your medicine is very well it's very effective.<eos> But how do you defend yourselves?<eos> We don't.
Yeah.<eos> Hi. Sorry.<eos> I was sleeping.<eos> LnoUced_<eos> - How's your energy level?<eos> - Oh, you know, I...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't feel sick at all.<eos> Your IVIRls and your charts aren't here yet. But I have an idea what to expect.<eos> You probably do too, from your medical training.
Jason's covering for me.<eos> - He's in jail because of me.<eos> - That's what he can't tell anyone?<eos> But people could've figured it out:<eos> Lucas Menand, Dr Yonechi.<eos> - These people are now dead.<eos> - No, it's not what you think.<eos> - You know who this old man is, don't you?<eos> - I don't. I swear to you.<eos> But Jason does.
No?<eos> Agent Scully is dying and you haven't done a damn thing about it.<eos> - You think that's funny?<eos> - Just enjoying the irony, Mr Skinner.<eos> Only yesterday you said you wouldn't be party to murder. And now here you are.<eos> Yours isn't the first gun I've had pointed in my face, Mr Skinner.<eos> I'm not afraid to die.<eos> But if you kill me, you'll also kill Agent Scully.<eos> You have no intention of saving her.<eos> You never did.
Nobody dies until I tell them to die.<eos> You should eat.<eos> Please?<eos> - I didn't mean to harm anyone.<eos> - Well, you did.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> They were trying to kill me.<eos> - You tried to kill Sean.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.
Oh, shit!<eos> We'll probably crash head first, right?<eos> I'll be in the back, on the black box.<eos> Here we go now! Yeah, yeah!<eos> I saved our fucking life!<eos> I have some advice for you right now.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Don't move.<eos> I said, "Don't move!"<eos> I didn't, asshole!
Okay just fill this out please.<eos> Charlie, come here.<eos> I want to talk to you.<eos> He says he's not gay, but let's see what some drinks and a massage will do to him.<eos> That'll gay him up, don't you think?<eos> Look at the way he's standing.<eos> He's not gay?<eos> He's waiting for you.<eos> Oh, that's...<eos> I don't...
- Under some pressure?<eos> There was some pressure.<eos> - He blows up a building...<eos> - Minor structural damage.<eos> It was an interesting experiment.<eos> It might have worked.<eos> Didn't you think this information was important?<eos> I don't see the relevance.<eos> - You don't see a small connection?<eos> - No, Agent Ford, I don't.
George Frank Anselmo's in there.<eos> Tell him to come up.<eos> I want to see him in the lobby.<eos> Just list them for me.<eos> That's all.<eos> Let me get back to you.<eos> We're missing the best part.<eos> You know it by heart.<eos> I saw you lip-synching.<eos> Well, lucky I do.
Um,... ..when that tank fired on your chopper,... ..you said that, uh... .."You should go for altitude and call for support", right?<eos> Sir?<eos> You knew this wasn't Panama.<eos> Men were going to die, so you wanted to get out, right?<eos> Wh... who told you that, sir?<eos> Tea Party?<eos> Ilario?<eos> It doesn't matter who told me that.<eos> You don't want to know what happened out there, sir.<eos> Yes, I do.
Ready?<eos> Are you impressed?<eos> - You look like Loni Anderson.<eos> - Want to touch it?<eos> - It's real.<eos> - And simpler than going to a salon.<eos> Wait. watch.<eos> - Make me blonde.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - Do something to me.
And what's this in your ear?<eos> Toro, toro!<eos> - Ole! Look.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Sarah.<eos> I had a dream about you.<eos> I saw them shoot you and your son.<eos> I saw you drowning.<eos> How did I survive?<eos> You didn't.
- I am well-instructed in arithmetic!<eos> I cannot fathom you people!<eos> I can never offer one proposition but I face a howling riot of argument!<eos> I've wondered if the devil be in it somewhere.<eos> Welcome to Salem.<eos> Mr. Hale!<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Well, I see you've come well-prepared.<eos> - This is Thomas Putnam.<eos> - How do you do?
Now.<eos> Mr. Proctor when the devil appeared to you, did you see Rebecca Nurse in his company?<eos> No.<eos> Did you see her sister, Mary Eastey, with the devil?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Did you ever see Giles Corey with the devil?<eos> Or his wife?<eos> I did not see them.<eos> Did you ever see anyone with the devil?<eos> No, I did not.
- Mom, I'm gonna do great this hole.<eos> Mom, I am.<eos> I'm going to do so good, I bet you 50 cents I make it.<eos> - Joe, we don't gamble.<eos> - Come on, Mom!<eos> OK. 50 cents.<eos> And that's it.<eos> Get in there!<eos> Get in there!<eos> - I did it!
It's so much nicer here since he left.<eos> I hope he never comes back.<eos> -Where'd you find those?<eos> -I found them yesterday.<eos> Give them to me.<eos> -They're good, just a little rusty.<eos> -Give them to me!<eos> It means nothing.<eos> The pool was empty and maybe he saw them at the bottom.<eos> I didn't. Did you?
- A truce.<eos> Get out of my mouth and let's talk face-to-face.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> I give you my word.<eos> The word of a dragon. It's worthless.<eos> I should have known!<eos> Go on.<eos> Kill me!<eos> I don't want to kill you!<eos> I never did!
Is it just the money?<eos> Trying to start your own dirty, little war somewhere?<eos> Wars?<eos> Wars, John?<eos> Wars come and go.<eos> We did Nam, we lost.<eos> We did the Gulf, we won.<eos> What changed?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing ever does.
Everything was planned, sir.<eos> I can't control it if some convict starts shooting' up the road crew.<eos> He won't be shootin' anybody else.<eos> The most important thing is Dodge is on the move and we are on him.<eos> The locals have no idea what's goin' on.<eos> Politicians put a lot of pressure on you with this, huh?<eos> - You mean the Attorney General's office.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Who said I was talkin' to them?<eos> - You just did.
- You!<eos> - Don't worry!<eos> We're going.<eos> We only came...<eos> We'll hire you.<eos> - How much?<eos> - Sorry?<eos> Yes. How much?<eos> We already discussed that.<eos> I didn't. Did you?
I'm working with you because of that memo.<eos> I loved that memo.<eos> It's a mission statement.<eos> Well...<eos> Sorry about the hand.<eos> You know that feeling? You're not completely embarrassed yet but you glimpse tomorrow's embarrassment?<eos> Don't worry about it, boss.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You said "boss."<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Ivan gave it to me.<eos> Is living with me so hard?<eos> Do you know that I love you?<eos> I love you from the bottom of my heart.<eos> My son is here in prison.<eos> I must see the Commander.<eos> Get him.<eos> They are bandits.<eos> You think I didn't try to arrange a trade?<eos> I did.
That technology just consumes you<eos> I need your help.<eos> You can find me at the 3rd st.<eos> Tunnel eleven, if you change your mind.<eos> Doctor Benjamin Trace.<eos> Only he can stop this.<eos> - What if he won't jack-in?<eos> Tell him I'm building his chip.<eos> - My dog does not stink.<eos> - Yes, it does, Shawn...
Want a bazooka to finish it off?<eos> -What happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> The kid's just leaving tracks.<eos> Marko, let Uncle Velja give you some candy.<eos> You give me that little gun and I'll give you some candy.<eos> Take the kid out of here.<eos> -Let's go, kid.<eos> How'd I shoot?<eos> -You did.
We have to coordinate some stuff.<eos> Anyway, how's it going?<eos> Good. Everything's under control.<eos> I'll go out to the Palisades later.<eos> - Then I'll go by Sherman Oaks.<eos> - I took care of it, pal.<eos> - I'll go to North Hollywood.<eos> - I'll do that on the way.<eos> - Reseda?<eos> - Already did it.
He was like a father to me.<eos> Yeah, but you...<eos> How am I gonna say this?<eos> Were you in the room when he was murdered?<eos> How can you explain that?<eos> There was someone else in that room, Mr Vail.<eos> - There was a third person?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Did you tell the police this?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Now, use your fucking head.<eos> Go check on the kid.<eos> They kill your brother, and you wanna walk away?<eos> What the hell does that make you?<eos> This thing is not over.<eos> I swear to you right now.<eos> Now, more than ever this guy will pay.<eos> Can I have a chocolate bar?<eos> - I know you.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Stop right there! - Don't shoot.<eos> It's me!<eos> I found Tatum. She's dead. - I think Stu did it.<eos> - Don't listen to him, Sidney!<eos> - Stay back!<eos> - Stu did it.<eos> He killed Billy! He killed my Tatum! - You did it!<eos> Sidney, baby, please, give me that gun!<eos> Give me that gun! Christ, man!<eos> No, I didn't.
I don't care.<eos> But in here, the guards call the play<eos> -and the play calls for them to win the game.<eos> -Why?<eos> Guards steer clear of me, all right?<eos> They stay back and let me do my time.<eos> If I play that game and hurt one of them, they just might change my cushion.<eos> I'm not saying we gotta win.<eos> I just don't want to take a beating.<eos> You do, every day.
-Did the sound frighten you?<eos> -Very much.<eos> Did you close your eyes?<eos> At first, until the shooting stopped.<eos> Then I opened them.<eos> Did you think the men who did the shooting were going to kill everybody in McHale's?<eos> I really didn't know what to think.<eos> I just knew that the man had been shot.<eos> Did you think you might be shot dead by the two cold-blooded killers?<eos> Yes, I did.
How long have you known them?<eos> Since they were boys.<eos> They were both students of mine.<eos> Remain standing.<eos> How long have you been there?<eos> -lt'll be 20 years this spring.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> -I'm a priest.<eos> In the case of The People of the State of New York against John Reilly and Thomas Marcano, do you swear the evidence you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?<eos> I do.
- Hey, move aside!<eos> - You little shit!<eos> - I don't wanna go to jail.<eos> - You won't, it was self-defence.<eos> - Who'll believe me?<eos> - It's on tape!<eos> We now know about the cameras.<eos> - So what?<eos> The cops don't like me.<eos> Nobody does.
Thank you, detective.<eos> Your witness. Detective Allegretto, have you ever heard of the name Kleinhoff?<eos> Who?<eos> - Kleinhoff.<eos> No, not that I can recall.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That's all. The witness is excused.<eos> Detective Liam Casey<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
You did it in a bathroom on a plane? Who said anything about a bathroom?<eos> And so in light of the videotape evidence and the eyewitness account of the now-traumatized student who had the misfortune of opening the door at exactly the wrong moment we must conclude that Bud Bundy is absolutely 100 percent guilty.<eos> Does the defense possibly have anything to say other than the obvious "I'm so, so sorry"?<eos> We do not dispute the evidence of this case.<eos> He committed the act. There was no crime.<eos> Allow me to quote from your official student handbook.<eos> "Abstinence saves lives."<eos> Constant, never-ending self-love.<eos> Would you rather he do what he did or be out there breeding?<eos> And I did the Bundy at the Ice Capades.
No, I just got word.<eos> I have to leave tonight.<eos> Centauri Prime wants me back on Minbar for some special ceremony.<eos> Well, good. Good.<eos> They are seeing the value in your position.<eos> It should never be a joke to them, Vir.<eos> Never let them think that.<eos> I won't.<eos> I hope you don't mind the rush to get you off station but the doc says that injection's gonna wear off soon.<eos> I do, indeed.
Kosh!<eos> Kosh.<eos> My people are going over Kosh's place with a fine- toothed comb but we've got nothing.<eos> No sign of forced entry, no prints, no DNA fragments.<eos> The place looks like it's been through a war.<eos> - No sign of a body.<eos> - You will not find one.<eos> - Then how do you know he's dead?<eos> - I know.<eos> So do the Vorlons, somehow.
We believe bounty hunters are here looking for him.<eos> We must slip him into the station quietly.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - He just spent six months among the League worlds gathering information.<eos> He was on his way here when he was attacked.<eos> Doctor, we cannot let him die.<eos> That'll happen if we don't get him to Medlab right away.<eos> Security is very tight, and the Narns are at all of the customs areas.<eos> How do we know whom to trust?<eos> You don't, but I do.
They, too, are no longer Narns. Only slaves.<eos> And then dead slaves.<eos> Is that what you want, G'Kar?<eos> Is it?<eos> One scream, that's all!<eos> One little scream, and he will let you live!<eos> And we will both get what we want.<eos> You don't know what you're asking.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - Yes, I do!
What crimes?<eos> I don't...<eos> The crime of neglect!<eos> The crime of convenience.<eos> During your little war, you drove away the Shadows.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> But you did not think to clean up your mess.<eos> If a few of their minions, their dark servants, came to Centauri Prime well, where is the harm in that, yes?<eos> You want to see the harm?<eos> Do you?
Oh, okay, um, I mean Frank Senior.<eos> He went out for groceries.<eos> Will he be back soon?<eos> He left four years ago. We're expecting him back any minute.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> I'm sorry about the dog. Everything.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, lady! Hey, wait up!<eos> - How do you know my dad?<eos> - Um, well, I don't really.
If you want to get a drink later, we can.<eos> That sounds great.<eos> - Oh, and listen, it's gonna be...<eos> - I know.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Maybe this wouldn't have happened if I'd been more nurturing or I'd paid more attention or I had a uterus.<eos> - I can't believe it.<eos> - I know.<eos> You know, you don't deserve this.<eos> You don't, Ross.
Don't you want to know about what?<eos> Don't care.<eos> I just love being right.<eos> Randy does have feelings for Lauren but Lauren doesn't have feelings for him.<eos> She's going out with Jason. Nyah.<eos> What could she possibly see in Jason?<eos> That guy's dad drives a Pacer.<eos> Well, Randy's really hurting.<eos> You remember what it feels like to be rejected.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Thank you.<eos> - Always nice to have you on the show. Yeah.<eos> Thank you very much, Tim.<eos> And Al, I want to really thank you for buying that Gold Circle Seat for the banquet.<eos> We never sold one of those before.<eos> Well, actually, I didn't...<eos> Sparky owns one of Michigan's hot rod detail shops - that specializes in interiors.<eos> - He's an expert upholsterer.<eos> Well, if I may say so myself, I'm pretty nimble with a thimble.<eos> - And you just did.
Your enthusiasm touches me deeply.<eos> As part of our urban-improvement plan my men have begun a few modernizing touches.<eos> Voilà.<eos> Smallville has been surrounded by a force field that cannot be breached...<eos> And another beautification effort my palace.<eos> At least for now.<eos> So to review:<eos> Since I am absolute ruler, it follows you are my slaves.<eos> Behold your ruler and bow down.<eos> We don't do much bowing here in Kansas.
- ...to seeing their doctors as saviors.<eos> - Understood.<eos> But add to that the fact that, since she left the hospital Clark's only seen her a total of 60 minutes.<eos> Because right now, my method requires limited visitation.<eos> Superman, I can't help but feel a little like Lex Luthor here.<eos> What is it you suspect me of exactly?<eos> Look, Lois means everything to Clark.<eos> Everything.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Of course I do.
-She'll die.<eos> -We'll all die, then.<eos> Come on, Kent. I'll help.<eos> It's too late.<eos> You say you love her. You say she means everything to you, then let her live.<eos> Give her that.<eos> Or do you want me to beg again?<eos> And you said I couldn't love.<eos> How little you understood me.<eos> How little anyone ever did.
What do you mean you can't go?<eos> If you're not there, we can't do the strip searches.<eos> I know.<eos> But that stupid show COPS is following me around.<eos> COPS?<eos> You're gonna be on COPS?<eos> It's my life's dream to be on COPS.<eos> But, Al, I work alone.<eos> You lose three partners in a week and suddenly nobody wants to ride with you.<eos> I do.
What won't they believe?<eos> That it's been so long.<eos> - Oh, um... 23 years.<eos> Here I am, I'm 32 and I haven't even told anybody.<eos> People keep secrets for all kinds of reasons, Connie.<eos> Everyone who knows you and loves you understands that.<eos> We want to do what's right here.<eos> We want to stand by Connie.<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> - Part of me does.
I cost a girl her life because I was afraid to love her.<eos> You can't love someone back to life.<eos> You can try.<eos> Clay... we don't know what was in her mind or in her heart.<eos> There's no way to know why she did what she did.<eos> Actually, there is a way.<eos> Before she died... Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.
You got to go on that duck hunt, John.<eos> Everyone gets drunk. There's camaraderie. Everyone relaxes.<eos> Go.<eos> Win Leslie back.<eos> You got another plan?<eos> Can I tell you something?<eos> Honestly? You kind of suck at piping.<eos> If you're going to suck at piping and also not shoot birds, you're not going to be a McMillan Man.<eos> Leslie will most likely fire me out there.<eos> Leslie won't.
They respect it.<eos> They're dogs.<eos> If you beat them, they obey you.<eos> Not women.<eos> Women don't fear pain the way men do.<eos> They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
Behind all the make believe.<eos> What is it that scares you so much?<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> Then why are we still here?<eos> Why am I still here?<eos> I'll see you at the beach.<eos> I can't go to the beach.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm not going to the beach.<eos> Oh, yeah, you will.
Then why are we still here?<eos> Why am I still here?<eos> I'll see you at the beach.<eos> I can't go to the beach.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm not going to the beach.<eos> Oh, yeah, you will.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You will.
So you decided you're the master in trivia now?<eos> See, the thing about me is, I'm smart as fuck.<eos> I see.<eos> Um, so since you got all the answers, what makes me such a good friend?<eos> - Hey... ♪ Bustin' all the trap niggas ♪ - Man, don't say that.<eos> - What?<eos> You know I don't really use that word.<eos> Yeah, man, I know, but, uh...<eos> I just really heard you say it, though.<eos> And now he won't anymore.
Right away, Doctor.<eos> I need to clean the field.<eos> Vitals stabilizing.<eos> He's out of the woods.<eos> All right, let's close him up.<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> It's quiet.<eos> Kirkman's still in surgery?<eos> There was a complication, but, uh... it looks like he'll pull through.<eos> So will we.
Tell me what you know about her. Jason?<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> I took it.<eos> You gave me the lead, remember?<eos> The Weddle case.<eos> I knew they had Luke.<eos> I also knew this is how they got you to confess to Nassar's murder. Jason, take your statement back.<eos> Tell me everything you know.<eos> Listen to me, if they know - that I'm cooperating with you...<eos> - They won't.
Streetcar was awesome.<eos> It was shit and this is shit.<eos> No. We haven't even had dinner yet.<eos> Hold on.<eos> We haven't had dinner.<eos> We haven't...<eos> It's too soon.<eos> Sorry, my bad, I guess.<eos> - I guess we should eat... - Yeah.<eos> - And then we'll...
Felipe Camargo has dominated this competition!<eos> Look at that!<eos> One-handed!<eos> It's an honor to be here representing Brazil.<eos> I always devote 100% to everything I do.<eos> Brazil!<eos> One of the best efforts I have ever seen.<eos> But, as we enter the final level, he's found a worthy challenger in Ludwig Hefele.<eos> With phenomenal parkour skills, Ludwig Hefele, he's got the speed...<eos> Wills his way back!
Look at this face.<eos> It's a horror show.<eos> Come on, Hansel.<eos> It can't be that bad.<eos> It is.<eos> - Take off your mask.<eos> - No.<eos> No way.<eos> No one's ever seen me without this mask.<eos> And no one ever will.
Mmm.<eos> I figured out way back, if God is all-powerful, he cannot be all-good.<eos> And if he is all-good, then he cannot be all-powerful.<eos> And neither can you be.<eos> They need to see the fraud you are.<eos> With their eyes.<eos> The blood on your hands.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Hmm.<eos> And tonight, they will.
Except for a faint one from that big pagoda. I mean the office building.<eos> - Asked anyone about it?<eos> - We figured we'd wait for you.<eos> We've been trying to e-mail Karim.<eos> Karim Al-Ahmad.<eos> I have a meeting with him at 3:00.<eos> - That's great.<eos> Yeah, that's not gonna work.<eos> - But what if the king arrives today?<eos> - He won't.
Calientetate.<eos> Hey, everything will be fine... do not die!<eos> Do you listen?<eos> Calientetate.<eos> Returns!<eos> Do not die!<eos> I want to see it again ... last time.<eos> I promise!<eos> I swear today until the end of days, I will love you and honor you, if you are with me.<eos> I will, now and forever.
I can go to any school in Michigan, for free.<eos> So you don't have to worry about anything.<eos> Nothing, Maman.<eos> Not even a cent.<eos> So you're done with Harvard?<eos> Uh, well, I... I haven't heard back from them.<eos> But this is an option, a really good one.<eos> I just want the best for you, baby.<eos> We'll make it without you...<eos> By the skin of our teeth, we will.
- I want to call Mummy.<eos> No, I want to call Mummy.<eos> - Let me see.<eos> We're not going to call Mummy every five minutes!<eos> Let me see...<eos> You're fine!<eos> Let me call her!<eos> Ok, we'll call her, but calm down. You'll calm down?<eos> I'll call her.<eos> No, I will.
Yes?<eos> Uh, well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day.<eos> Ah, yes, the day of the great Chicago massacre.<eos> Uh, and our employees have requested to leave early to be with their loved ones.<eos> Of course, uh, I'll be with you.<eos> Ooh, Smithers.<eos> More face hardener.<eos> Never!<eos> Well, if you want to tamp down a potential rebellion, might I suggest a party after work.<eos> A sweethearts dance, if you will.
So there's no alliance here, just a place to spit shit on others.<eos> I want no part.<eos> I'm gettin' out.<eos> Why are you looking at me?<eos> He's my brother, if he goes, I go too, we're the same thing.<eos> Ciro, if they go, we'll lose the best money-making spots.<eos> This fuck up can really cost us.<eos> She left the shop keys, she's not back and doesn't answer her phone.<eos> - You have to find her, Luciano.<eos> - We will, Prince.
She's safe thanks to you.<eos> Well, she was in danger thanks to me.<eos> Me, too.<eos> What about yours?<eos> Where is she now?<eos> Once you told me...<eos> you wanted me to feel whole.<eos> That you wanted that more than you wanted to be with me.<eos> I couldn't imagine what you meant or who I would be if that happened.<eos> And maybe it never will.
Five-hundred words on the dual Metallo attacks in Metropolis and National City with eyewitness accounts, comments from police sources and zero adjectives, all thoroughly vetted and verified.<eos> - You don't work here.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> Not if I don't say so.<eos> You will.<eos> Read it and you'll see.<eos> You done wasting my time?<eos> You don't want it?<eos> Fine.<eos> Plenty of other outlets will.
We studied under the same Master.<eos> His name is Zhang Yi.<eos> He is a man of his word and a martial arts expert.<eos> You're no match for him.<eos> So what? Do you think I'll just give up like that?<eos> What about those three lives?<eos> Then why did you toast me earlier?<eos> One lives through one's conscience.<eos> I will bring the children to the Capital.<eos> You Will?
Uh, I don't, uh...<eos> I didn't allow them to cremate him today.<eos> You didn't?<eos> Because we might want an autopsy.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> I'm not sure this is maybe the right place to discuss this.<eos> How about we, uh, find one of your boys who can give you a lift home?<eos> It's been a long day, honey.<eos> - But we... we will talk?<eos> - Yes, of course we will.
What's going on?<eos> I have to go to Berlin.<eos> Now?<eos> No.<eos> It's just for a couple of days.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> What did I say? You don't trust me.<eos> Trust you?<eos> Trust is not going to fix this, John.<eos> Nothing will.
Ninevictims,bennett.<eos> Heart,eyes,genitals, handsandfeet are materials needed to perform vicaripulvari.<eos> Has the church been compromised?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Youhavesomefriends inthistown.<eos> Theycanhelpyou .<eos> Father marcus, the one we feared, until you lost that little boy.<eos> Who's jessica?<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'cause the demon will.
It's easy to find out if I'm lying, just have him take down his trousers.<eos> You're not buying this crap, are you, Baby?<eos> Someone go get a microscope so we locate Mr. DeMarco's pecker.<eos> You know what? I'm not stripping.<eos> I'm not stripping for nobody.<eos> I think you must, Daniel.<eos> Nicholas is risking his life on a very unusual long shot here.<eos> I know it's embarrassing, but I'll make it easier for you.<eos> You and I will go in the other room, and we'll both take down our pants.<eos> I won't. I won't.
I will not let you escapes again, Alice.<eos> If you want to start again, then you have to do with me.<eos> Just you and me and Amy.<eos> And we'll be fine.<eos> - I love you, Alice.<eos> - I'm pregnant, David.<eos> Jesus Christ, Alice.<eos> I want to have this baby.<eos> Alice ...<eos> Of course we will, Alice.
Yes!<eos> Death to the witches!<eos> Open the Dragon Gate.<eos> Run!<eos> - Run, Dina!<eos> - No!<eos> No!<eos> - Run away, Dina.<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> I won't!
This thing is almost over.<eos> Hang tight.<eos> Hello, bound lady.<eos> Not now, Aldo.<eos> I think Mr. Fine has underestimated you.<eos> You found your targets, you tracked them down, you fought very hard.<eos> Susan... you are a good agent.<eos> You'll get them next time, huh?<eos> Unless we die here.<eos> Then you will not.
The impact, the stress --<eos> Odette/Odile, Kitri,<eos> - I'm quite familiar with your resume.<eos> - Raymonda, Sleeping Beauty...<eos> But, darling, I would be lying if I said there wasn't some concern.<eos> What is this concern?<eos> Who is concerning?<eos> Toni mentioned that she might be willing to go with Claire tomorrow t-to save your ankle after "Rubies."<eos> The public comes to see me.<eos> And they will in "Rubies."
How do you catch demons, Lord Zhong?<eos> Using my eyes ...<eos> I fix my eyes on them ... untill they reveal themselves!<eos> So what are demons like in broad daylight?<eos> Most demons take the form of beautiful women.<eos> Are there any demons, Lord Zhong will not slay?<eos> Come see my performance tomorrow night!<eos> Depends on who it is!<eos> Sister, what if he doesn't come tomorrow?<eos> He will!
I want you to marry me.<eos> Morello, no touching!<eos> Back in your seat, now!<eos> Well, don't leave a girl hanging.<eos> What do you say?<eos> You are the most amazing girl I have ever met, Lorna Morello.<eos> I mean, it should be the guy doing the asking, but I gotta say there's something kind of hot about you down on your knees like that.<eos> Yes.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Yes, I will. -Oh!
Look at this.<eos> Sasha: Shoul have torn us apart.<eos> It in't.<eos> Sasha: Why are we here?<eos> Maggie: For this.<eos> I see it.<eos> Noah, that ki... he sai he in't know if he can make it.<eos> That's how I feel.<eos> You're gonna make it.<eos> Both of us, we will.
You misjudge me.<eos> The past is dead.<eos> I am a different woman now.<eos> The past is never dead.<eos> But we are finished with each other.<eos> From now on, we will be strangers.<eos> You are a stranger to yourself.<eos> The truth is staring you in the face and you can't even see it.<eos> What truth? Whatever I am... You love me.<eos> And you always will.
I know the attorney told you not to talk to anyone, but we're telling you something different now.<eos> These officers need your help.<eos> Your mommy and I want you to help them.<eos> Katori, come on.<eos> Who gave those drugs to you?<eos> Who are you protecting right now?<eos> You have to tell them.<eos> I can't.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Then I won't.
- Thanks.<eos> Oh, how nice.<eos> Well...<eos> let's see what's on your diploma.<eos> - "Ove Lind..." - Will you marry me?<eos> I thought that if you'd like to, we...<eos> Speak calmly and clearly.<eos> - Will you marry me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes, I will!
Your DNA was found amongst the remains at the terrace.<eos> Why fake your own death?<eos> In the face of universal loathing, who would want to be Johnny Royalle?<eos> In the face of universal loathing, why resurrect him?<eos> This city is my home.<eos> I wanted to come home.<eos> I wanted to make something here.<eos> A house of sorts.<eos> A safe place.<eos> A celebration, if you will.
See, Connor Freeman is dead.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, it's hard for me to accept that, I guess.<eos> The victim was cut.<eos> Do you mind if I check your knives for blood?<eos> These men are gonna think that you suspect them.<eos> Well, at this point, I suspect everyone.<eos> Even you.<eos> All right, look, a lot of these guys are gonna make it because of the work that you've done, all right?<eos> And some of them won't.
– Yes, she does.<eos> You love me.<eos> That's why I grew up.<eos> Sometimes, she wouldn't allow me to go out.<eos> Really?<eos> – Didn't your father say anything?<eos> – He did.<eos> He was nicer?<eos> Maybe he'll come back too.<eos> – He won't.
Nicklas must come with us.<eos> No.<eos> After what happened at the station there is nothing we can do.<eos> He doesn't like when he gets locked ...<eos> Moreover, it doesn't look good that you didn't report this by yourself.<eos> They want to keep him under observation until further notice.<eos> You know exactly what they will do with him!<eos> Of course we'll do everything we can, to get Nicklas home soon, but ...<eos> Gerda, I'm terribly sorry.<eos> Mom ... no, I will not!
Put the gun down!<eos> Don't act stupid. Put it down!<eos> I'm going to shoot!<eos> Stop!<eos> Pull over.<eos> Manu. We need to trust each other.<eos> We had no choice.<eos> He tried running off with our money.<eos> We'll make it.<eos> We will.
You're telling me you don't want to hack yourself off a slice of this long, greasy dick?<eos> - I told you I'm with Blake.<eos> - Blake can't blow your life like I can.<eos> You don't even know him.<eos> I know he's got a pair of duck boots jammed in his butthole.<eos> You'll come around, Katie, Duchess of Snobville.<eos> I know you will.<eos> I know you will.<eos> I know you will.<eos> You will.
Why aren't you with her?<eos> She's a private woman and wanted only those closest to her near.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I didn't make the short list, given our unhappiness.<eos> I am sorry, Antoine.<eos> So you'll forgive me if I seek distraction elsewhere.<eos> Find a hobby or a whore or something other than revenge to occupy you.<eos> You risk both our lives going after the king's brother.<eos> If I have to, I will stop you myself.<eos> No, you won't.
Let's not allow the ardor of Argentina to die.<eos> - Come where exactly?<eos> - Onto the dance floor.<eos> I can't do the dances of that region.<eos> - Please, don't let me down.<eos> - Don't, really.<eos> Relax. Leave it to me.<eos> Don't, Ms. Sultan.<eos> I'll disgrace myself.<eos> I truly will.
I've lost everything!<eos> And now I want to hold on to something that no one can take away.<eos> You can't be a married woman, a mother and a madam.<eos> What kind of life is that for our children?<eos> Please don't ask me to choose.<eos> I am.<eos> Between this life and one with me.<eos> Between respectability, a family, a man who loves you...<eos> I can't give this up.<eos> I won't.
You'll always be the someday I want.<eos> But I have to go back and you have to stay.<eos> It'll be easier this way.<eos> The last time I heard that was when my mom dropped me off in the States.<eos> And I accepted it because I thought there'd be a someday.<eos> But there wasn't.<eos> There was just... wasted time and then she was gone.<eos> I don't believe in someday. Not anymore.<eos> Lucky for you, I do.<eos> And I always will.
That's why it hurts when you press on it.<eos> And you think the person who did this to us, the person who's after us, is Charles?<eos> - The dead Charles?<eos> - He never was, and I knew it.<eos> He tried to make us believe he was dead because he had to.<eos> I mean, the only reason he gave his name up was because he thought we'd never get out of that hellhole.<eos> - Okay, so what was Lesli?<eos> - A speed bump.<eos> On the way to finding Charles.<eos> But we will.
I did, she won't help.<eos> If that girl has information about Daylight on her body, then we are in very serious trouble.<eos> It was a dream.<eos> A sex dream.<eos> So, who do you think he was, this dream man?<eos> That guy had a tattoo of a tree on his arm, and Weller doesn't have that.<eos> _<eos> Okay.<eos> If the wrong people find it...<eos> The right people will.
Everything's changed.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> You got a minute for gay rights?<eos> Gay rights? !<eos> Geez, you already got all those.<eos> What the hell do you want to do now?<eos> All right.<eos> Your total is $126.39.<eos> And would you like to give a dollar to help hungry children get iPads to protect your Internet safe space today?<eos> I will.
Crazy, man.<eos> - Yeah, watch your toes.<eos> Rock on, my brother!<eos> That's it, Dad.<eos> Drive away like a chickenshit dildo!<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - That's what I thought.<eos> - Well, Kevin, you made your bed.<eos> - Not yet, but I will!
What do you think?<eos> The day you go to a restaurant, you're going with me.<eos> And tonight, you're eating here!<eos> No!<eos> That's too much!<eos> You're really starting to get on my nerves!<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said... that I'm starting... to feel nervous.<eos> And whether you like it or not, I'm going to a restaurant tonight!<eos> - No, you won't!
No!<eos> That's too much!<eos> You're really starting to get on my nerves!<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said... that I'm starting... to feel nervous.<eos> And whether you like it or not, I'm going to a restaurant tonight!<eos> - No, you won't!<eos> - Yes, I will!<eos> - No, you won't!<eos> - Yes, I will!
"This could be us in a few years."<eos> Yes, respect.<eos> They'll want us to like them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then we say, "By the way, keep it down."<eos> Exactly.<eos> Well, we won't say it like that.<eos> We'll just...<eos> No, of course not. I'll say it.<eos> Like, we'll just...
Hold out your hand.<eos> Which one?<eos> I don't know... doesn't matter. The left one.<eos> Are you going to offer me a ring?<eos> Will you be quiet?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You know the powers of this water.<eos> If you ever get hurt,<eos> If anything should happen,<eos> Nothing ever will.
Does that mean Vester has to go?<eos> He said he wouldn't.<eos> He has to, he is one of us.<eos> I baptized him.<eos> I don't trust Vester.<eos> Me neither. It's true, Reverend.<eos> Vester is a brute with no conscience.<eos> I'll go.<eos> You can't.<eos> Yes I will.
- Calm down!<eos> OK, look, I'm sorry.<eos> OK? Really fucking sorry.<eos> I am, about all of this.<eos> But we've got a bigger problems right now.<eos> Yatesey's a prick.<eos> OK? Shown his true colours and after this, we drop him like a stone.<eos> But right now, we need him.<eos> OK, Frankie can wait, mate.<eos> Marcel won't.
I'm coming with you, but it must become at once.<eos> What is that?<eos> What is it?<eos> - It's my canary.<eos> - Do you take with you a cage?<eos> - I'm leaving her.<eos> - Release the cage!<eos> It's the only thing that I take.<eos> Release the cage, I say!<eos> Kathleen will at any time.
We will familiarize ourselves with it all.<eos> Yes, that's fine. Perfect.<eos> Here you go. Here is the office.<eos> Good day.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Here's the investment list first for real estate.<eos> - Is it also in paper form?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - So give me the papers.<eos> - Yes, as you will.
Before my time.<eos> She's being cheeky again. She knows that Dyad was inventing vaccines.<eos> Yes, polio, Spanish influenza.<eos> - Manufactured right here.<eos> - COSIMA: Right. Shipped all over the world and millions of lives saved.<eos> Oh, so this is where you keep the clones?<eos> Well, obviously, you're part of a high-security programme.<eos> Yeah, most restricted projects are entirely compartmentalised.<eos> Right, so smart people don't know what they're actually working on.<eos> Ah, but you will.
Hello, Felix.<eos> Colin.<eos> You're back. Provisionally.<eos> Is it safe to come in? That all depends on what you're scared of. Hmm, I don't know, cops showing up at my desk, full of innuendo about you?<eos> ♪ Could I need you this much? ♪ All of that has blown over.<eos> Felix Dawkins? Search warrant.<eos> ♪ Time flies ♪ Oh, shit, not again.<eos> No no, it's a misunderstanding, I'm sure.<eos> How's it going, Morguey? Better hope we don't find anything incriminating in your friend's place.<eos> You won't.
We lied out of love.<eos> Look how happy he is.<eos> I mean, he has no idea we had to cancel the wedding photos and my dad was so angry, he came up to our room and kicked Barney in the crotch.<eos> And the best part is your dad has no idea.<eos> He still loves me.<eos> Hey, do anyone else's balls hurt?<eos> And, look, some good came out of all this.<eos> Seeing you like that, we all vowed never to get that drunk again.<eos> Well, actually I didn't.<eos> But I will now.
The question is...<eos> Who am I?<eos> Right.<eos> I give you a clue, you have a minute to guess<eos> The identity of the person in question.<eos> We must find a weapon to defeat moloch.<eos> I fail to understand how a game played on telephones Will help us solve our dire problem at hand.<eos> It won't.
- I can't, my arm hurts.<eos> - Your arm?<eos> - Crybaby!<eos> - I'm busy on holiday.<eos> - So we aren't coming back?<eos> - Change of plans.<eos> - Rogal will get her.<eos> - No, Stefan!<eos> - He's a better candidate.<eos> - Stefan will!
You must have rolled right into the wrong neighborhood.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - What are we doing?<eos> - Let's see ...<eos> - Oh, lord ...<eos> - Oh, lord ...<eos> It seems like these girls are doing a kind of blackmail.<eos> They filmed you while you were doing things that may be illegal in Norway.<eos> Wha will they?
This is all part of a dream.<eos> Lexi, why are you doing this? !<eos> Bigger question is, why are you?<eos> It's not like you to give up on family, Tom.<eos> I want to talk to Lexi, Dan.<eos> She don't want to talk to you.<eos> She's too scared. What's she afraid of?<eos> What'll happen when you wake up.<eos> That the mission will fail?<eos> That it won't.
It's complicated.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Probably.<eos> But... the answer is simple.<eos> Get out of there.<eos> Do you know what the British say?<eos> - Do you think it's my fault?<eos> - That's not what I said.<eos> What I say is that it's also your responsibility to make it stop.<eos> Because, clearly, he won't.
Uh I will be.<eos> I will be.<eos> Could... could we just pretend that everything between you and I is okay, just for a little bit?<eos> I could use that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I feel like everything is going wrong, and I have no idea what to do about it.<eos> I feel Like every single thing I am doing is wrong.<eos> You will figure it out.<eos> You will.<eos> You will, too.
Put some muscle to it!<eos> Worry about yourself, kiddo!<eos> There are things you can't fight, acts of God.<eos> You see a hurricane coming you have to get out of the way.<eos> But when you're in a Jaeger, suddenly you can fight the hurricane. You can win.<eos> Get them tied down and go down below! Now!<eos> How far to the mainland?<eos> Seven miles off Anchorage, sir.<eos> But we won't even make it past the shallows.<eos> No, we won't!
It will do you good.<eos> Talk a bit, some peace, general help...<eos> - Hello, but we can talk.<eos> - Yes, we still can.<eos> - But a little professional help, that...<eos> - I don't want that.<eos> - But you should.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> Let's go to your place and hang out.<eos> - No, we won't.
Is that what you want, Mr Munnings, to be civilised?<eos> Yes, Miss Carter-Wood.<eos> Is that all you want?<eos> No.<eos> So I'm going to ask you something.<eos> - Are you?<eos> - Just once.<eos> You are?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I will.
Come on. We're all in this together.<eos> You just wanna be able to tell everybody what to do.<eos> "Watch the signal fire. "Let's ration the food!<eos> "Don't shit in other people's tents"?<eos> - That's obvious.<eos> - Yeah. - I'll shit where I want.<eos> - Damn right, Troy.<eos> Look at Chris, everyone.<eos> How can he protect you from the dangers of the jungle when he won't even stand up to me now?<eos> Will you?
Uh, we may have a burglar. Or a ghost.<eos> A burglar.<eos> Ghost.<eos> Well, it just so happens I have my own ghost hunter reality show.<eos> Do you wanna know what it's called? I got one, too.<eos> Wild guess, American Ghost?<eos> Wrong!<eos> Ghost Guys.<eos> It is trademarked, so don't get any funny ideas.<eos> I definitely won't.
We'll not be alone.<eos> What about our children? Don't you see that they're French, Zé?<eos> They have their roots in Portugal!<eos> This is our country.<eos> That house was built by my great grandfather with his own hands.<eos> Pedro is the first man of the family not to have been born there.<eos> You've been complaining about not having an house there.<eos> The house of my dreams...<eos> But now we have it, and we are going to live there...<eos> The family will!
Extra pepperoni?<eos> What's the book?<eos> It's called "Birdsong." The definitive novel on World War I.<eos> Pretty serious stuff.<eos> Ben?<eos> Ben!<eos> What?<eos> You're nearly 15 minutes late.<eos> You're gonna miss the train.<eos> No, I won't.
Isn't it rather late for that?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> I think maybe you should just go.<eos> I have to be up in the morning to deal with this.<eos> I really appreciate you coming, but I need to sleep.<eos> If you're worried you should stay with a family member, a friend.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'll call my sister.<eos> Just make sure you don't drive anywhere.<eos> I won't. If you're not sure who might have keys, you should change the locks.<eos> I will.
I'm better now.<eos> You?<eos> Well, I pushed Derek's mother down the stairs.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - I did.<eos> They wanted me to radiate evil, so I looked her in the eyes, but I don't know how close the camera was because it was a stuntman in a dress.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I don't think there's a nice way you can do that.<eos> I'm not sure people will want my autograph anymore.<eos> Yes, they will.
Say no, that's what.<eos> Tansy, it's one night out.<eos> With my ex-husband and Zoe Hart, who I just don't find that much fun, and... when you're with her, I'm sorry, but neither are you.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I'm fun.<eos> (chuckles) I already went out with your parents, and it's as much forced smiling as my face can take for now.<eos> Okay, fine. I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll just tell Zoe you said no.<eos> Oh, no, you will not!
And I'm sorry for that one.<eos> Don't be.<eos> Because I'm just gonna say it I think it's super creepy you get sexually aroused by physical violence.<eos> Well, but also emotional violence.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's even creepier.<eos> So are you gonna open the damn door?<eos> As soon as you give me that weapon.<eos> Do you honestly wanna live through the rise of the machines?<eos> Which you won't, because no one will?
Besides, the rule is:<eos> I didn't see, I didn't hear, I don't know.<eos> You have to play the fool and seek revenge secretly.<eos> Do I have to teach you how to be a woman?<eos> Let me tell you, if you continue to act like this, you'll end up alone.<eos> Ergun! Ergun!<eos> Okay, wait here.<eos> I'm going to get Zeynep for you, okay?<eos> - Bring me my wife.<eos> - I will.
Took it with him to Korea.<eos> When he made it back in one piece, that made the knife a good luck charm.<eos> So...<eos> When my dad shipped out for Vietnam, he took it with him.<eos> He made it back home too, which made the damn thing Miracle lucky.<eos> Here.<eos> Make sure you always come back alive.<eos> Miles, I can't take this.<eos> I... I-I don't want this.<eos> One day, maybe your son will.
I did spring cleaning.<eos> It's weird to end the season.<eos> I won't see you.<eos> You should get email, Facebook.<eos> Electronic mail and social media?<eos> No, thanks. We'll text.<eos> But I have to cancel my sailing contract.<eos> It sucks.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Next winter we'll both he here, OK?
Your father has mentioned the possibility of a French bride.<eos> What would France say to that?<eos> One marriage for another.<eos> Beauty and blessings all round.<eos> Our little pack of wolves.<eos> What is their price?<eos> Land.<eos> The restoration of what has been taken from them.<eos> Tell them if they pledge their swords to me, they shall have all they had before, and the Borgia estates I will divide among them.<eos> I will.
Well, when I decided to go to Rose's ball, I felt it was wrong not to tell you, since you'd asked.<eos> - What changed your mind?<eos> - Why, I suppose it came to me that these balls and presentations and comings out, are not just aristocratic folderol, but traditions by which members of this family measure their progress through life.<eos> And you wanted to be part of that?<eos> Well, I felt, by dismissing it as trivia, I was being smug and intolerant.<eos> Do they know what they have in you?<eos> I know what I have in them.<eos> So? Have you decided whether or not you will come to the ball?<eos> Oh, how can you ask?<eos> Of course I will.
It has one purpose.<eos> To kill a child in utero by raising her blood temperature.<eos> It's for a miscarriage.<eos> So how much time do we have to fix this?<eos> It'll do what it's meant to by tonight's high tide.<eos> And, believe me, It will work.<eos> I saw her use a similar object on a kid who went mad and killed a bunch of priests.<eos> I'd like lo have a little chat with this Agnes.<eos> Where can I find her?<eos> You won't.
Lily, that's actually good.<eos> Can you really do makeup?<eos> Stay there.<eos> Is it really too much to ask that you consult me before you make such a big decision?<eos> Claire, when you went back to work, you asked me to take the reins.<eos> So I think you need to trust me now.<eos> Do you really think I'd put Luke in a dangerous situation?<eos> He's my favorite, which I did not just say.<eos> - If anything happens to him --<eos> - It won't.
- What?<eos> - I was the one who ruined the cake.<eos> I was afraid that all those boys were gonna make fun of you.<eos> I think I care more about you fitting in than you do.<eos> No, I care.<eos> I care a lot.<eos> It's just the stuff I'm good at isn't the stuff that makes you popular.<eos> Contestants, all cakes must be... at the judges' table in 60 seconds.<eos> Ay. there's no way we're gonna make it through that crowd.<eos> Like heck we won't. Here.
On me?<eos> What I mean to say is I...<eos> I only came with one purpose.<eos> I want to...<eos> Will you be my wife?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Wrong moment.<eos> It's the wrong moment.<eos> But will you?
For what? The í, you can kiss him.<eos> É what you want .<eos> Because you are talking á to me like that?<eos> Elise, you're á confusing everything.<eos> Everyone is á confusing. J á I got tired of it.<eos> V á away.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> Want a ch x í face á?<eos> I want ch n ã á.<eos> - But we ... - Will soon!
It s coming with me.<eos> Akkie!<eos> - Akkie! - Akkie!<eos> - Akkie. - Akkie, cad you ?<eos> Trim the ç, please. You won.<eos> Akkie, appears just.<eos> Joep.<eos> Joep!<eos> Help me.<eos> I already á will.
Marry, would the word "farewell" have lengthened hours and added years to his short banishment He should have had a volume of farewells.<eos> But since it would not, He had none of me.<eos> He is our cousin, cousin.<eos> We did observe his courtship of the common people. How he did seem to dive into their hearts With humble and familiar courtesy,<eos> What reverence he did throw away on slaves.<eos> Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench. A brace of draymen bid God speed him well, And had the tribute of his supple knee<eos> As were our England in reversion his.<eos> Well, he is gone, And with him go these thoughts.<eos> Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland, Expedient manage must be made, my liege, 'Ere further leisure yield them further means<eos> For their advantage and your highness' loss. We will ourself in person to this war,
How not going well?<eos> Well, not going well.<eos> - Not going well?<eos> - No. Not going well.<eos> That's not right.<eos> But... It will go well? No, it will not do well.<eos> We are not going well at all.<eos> Or if you are walking... But it will be wrong...<eos> - And you are ...?<eos> - Yes, I will...
- How the hell did that happen?<eos> - She figured it out.<eos> - I tried to lie- - You should've tried harder.<eos> Lemon, you don't have to worry.<eos> She won't tell anyone.<eos> If you were so confident about that, why are you telling me now?<eos> - I'm only telling you so you know.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Zoe Hart is walking around with the information that could undo my entire relationship.<eos> She won't.
Stop it, both of you!<eos> Stop what? I'm not bluffing.<eos> You work at opposite ends of the building.<eos> You barely see each other.<eos> It's not about seeing each other. It's about his methods costing me $1.2 million.<eos> If you'd like me to go somewhere else, Diane, just say the word.<eos> No, David.<eos> You will stay here because we leave you alone.<eos> Somewhere else will leave me just as alone.<eos> No, they won't.
I think I've frightened him. I told him he needed to get himself tested for HIV.<eos> Why? He's hang on, Sammy, he's what? He's done what?<eos> The whore...<eos> Let's get this straight, the whore has kicked him, your dad, out?<eos> Because in prison. I think he might of... like sold his assets.<eos> Oh, no way! He can't keep his pants up, can he?<eos> Right, well, there you go, eh?<eos> Taste of her own medicine. Bitch. Sold his...<eos> Can you work it out Alison? He's bringing an overnight bag with him where?<eos> I will.
- What you did for Mom...<eos> - I had to.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I know, and I'm sorry.<eos> No one should have to go through that.<eos> How long will you be gone?<eos> Look, if something happens while we're gone...<eos> We'll be all right.<eos> If anything happens, you get everyone locked in the cells, keep them all safe.<eos> - I will.
# Destiny has split our ways.<eos> # What shall we do, love we couldn't make our home.<eos> # I see, this love will burn me and you.<eos> # We drifted apart my love for eternity.<eos> You said, you wouldn't leave me?<eos> Liar!<eos> What are you writing again?<eos> I won't say.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - I won't.
Just like that.<eos> How else should it be?<eos> For God's sake, Hal, I told you that I had a kid in prison.<eos> You should have freaked out and told me I was the worst person in the world.<eos> Is that what you wanted?<eos> What I expected was the courtesy of an honest emotional reaction.<eos> Instead, I got "I'm gonna think about it" and teenage silences.<eos> Maggie --<eos> I can't deal with that, all right?<eos> I won't. Maggie.
He comes and you relapse.<eos> You don't want to, but still you go.<eos> It's not good for you but you can't resist.<eos> That guy's like cocaine.<eos> Is your life with me sad?<eos> I shouldn't meet him anymore.<eos> Dream on.<eos> Do you think you're enough for me?<eos> I won't see him anymore.<eos> I won't.
Hey, listen.<eos> My guys-- they found the Escalade.<eos> And the dude is there.<eos> Go.<eos> I'll get her home.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I didn't know anybody was in here.<eos> Otto, huh?<eos> We're gonna have to say something to each other - sooner or later.<eos> - No, we won't.
No, you're not moving out.<eos> I'm-I'm not?<eos> No, you can stay as long as you want.<eos> As long as you need.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, that's...<eos> that's so good to hear.<eos> Thataboy.<eos> I just... I just want you to not worry about anything.<eos> I won't.
Excuse me. Hello.<eos> Is this the Post?<eos> Wait!<eos> I work with Peter.<eos> I set up a shell corporation.<eos> We steer a little bit of his paycheck into a quiet little slush fund.<eos> He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> And if he were using this slush fund to binge on his favorite bad habit, where do you suppose we might find him?<eos> I rented an apartment in Tribeca under the name of the dummy corp.<eos> Yes, I will!

Will you tell?<eos> !<eos> Woman: [ crying ] No, I said I won't.<eos> - I'll kill you.<eos> - Please don't!<eos> - I swear I will.<eos> - Please don't!<eos> Will you tell?<eos> Jane: It's not Artie. It's Jonathan.<eos> I won't.
In fact, it was... one of the reasons that led me... to take the vows.<eos> And recently, I've been struggling with my faith, wondering if I really belong in the church, and it made me think of you and your tragedy.<eos> I thought if I came...<eos> And here you are.<eos> Hank struggled too.<eos> Um, for a long time, he... he wanted to get revenge on the bastard who ran her over.<eos> But I told him, "Hank, our Missy came home to us with a few broken bones.<eos> We get to live with our daughter.<eos> The monster who left her there has to live with himself."<eos> No. I won't.
Okay, I've been trying to think of a good way to say this, and I guess sometimes it's just best to come right out with it.<eos> Would you mind if I were to ask Tansy out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> As in my ex-wife...<eos> Tansy?<eos> Yeah, well, we were hanging out a couple weeks ago, election day... Huh.<eos> Actually, and, well, we... we had a real connection.<eos> And I keep on thinking that I should maybe take her out and see if there's anything to it.<eos> But I think that she might be a little self-conscious about the whole situation, unless, of course, you were okay with it, so... what do you say?<eos> Well, well, I'll, uh...
- "Your father won't give me horses."<eos> - Stop, why repeat my lines?<eos> - My sister...<eos> - You have no sister!<eos> - It's not true.<eos> - My sister played Chekhov for many years. I know it by heart.<eos> - "The Seagull". - Masha.<eos> Masha, confidently:<eos> "He will, ask him for them."<eos> "He will."
They don't know nothing about this.<eos> This is life.<eos> Everything you, you want or care about in this world... it ends up nowhere, right?<eos> My mom says she's gonna put me back in the hospital.<eos> It's like they're always trying to get rid of me or something.<eos> But when I get out, I'm gonna get a job.<eos> I'm gonna get enough money to get an apartment... and we're gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna be okay, Milk.<eos> And I never will.<eos> I never will.
I just want you to think about it.<eos> Ask yourself what you think mom would have wanted.<eos> I'm going. Bye.<eos> Do you have any fours?<eos> - You ask just about fours.<eos> No, go jump in the ocean.<eos> - Do you have any sevens?<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> No!<eos> No, I will not!
William, I need your help.<eos> I have reason to believe subject 13, Olivia Dunham, has been able to cross over to the other side.<eos> But I believe that young Olivia may need to be in some kind of heightened emotional state to access her ability.<eos> I'm compiling some recordings on my new Betamax.<eos> Perhaps you'll be able to see something I cannot.<eos> Okay, Olivia.<eos> You feeling comfortable?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> These wires will show me how you respond to the tests.<eos> I'll just... Ashley.
- These are turbulent times, Father.<eos> You can leave us now.<eos> I need advice, dottore, on a delicate matter.<eos> The deposition of a pope.<eos> - Delicate indeed.<eos> And, if I may say so, dangerous.<eos> - Stop that.<eos> You have done penance enough.<eos> - Who then will forgive us, Your Holiness?<eos> - God will.
- No.<eos> If I don't...<eos> Then do remember how very glad I am that we made up when we had the chance.<eos> I mean it.<eos> You send me off to war a happy man.<eos> Will you do something for me?<eos> Will you... Will you look after Mother?<eos> - If anything happens.<eos> - Of course we will.<eos> But it won't.
This is the house that will protect us and offer safety. If God wills.<eos> We only want one thing. And that is to survive.<eos> Van Heemskerck is the captain. He remains the captain.<eos> But now he's a captain with no ship.<eos> If I look around me: 11 men and a bird.<eos> God... I'm jealous of the bird.<eos> If we all had two wings... we'd be in the Indies by now.<eos> We called it the Kept House, made from flotsam and the beams of our ship.<eos> The Kept House will protect and shelter us.<eos> If God wills.
Because you look at her the same way.<eos> That's enough, alicia.<eos> I realize that you're not happy with my decision to make her vice-president, but watch what you say.<eos> Mariangela has qualifications that we don't have.<eos> We're good at sales, but we don't have a clue about business.<eos> The board already warned us.<eos> If we go on like this, we'II go bankrupt.<eos> We need Mariangela, baby.<eos> We need her if we want to grow.<eos> The family will.
That is the official BlueBell itinerary for homecoming weekend.<eos> Flip to page three, you will see that Jimmy Praboo is officiating the coin toss at the game this Friday.<eos> - Now, that is where we wanna get him.<eos> - Hey, Lemon. We don't need a location for the prank. We need a prank.<eos> And the key to pulling off a perfect prank is specificity.<eos> I cannot practice proper psychological warfare until I understand...<eos> - ... the psyche of who I'm dealing with.<eos> - She's making up words.<eos> If you want my help in destroying Jimmy Praboo I need to know his Achilles' heel.<eos> His fatal flaw, if you will.
Why are you being so fucking strident?<eos> "Strident"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> You should leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I called you strident?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You should leave.<eos> Okay, I will.
Get out of here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "Good Morning America" got the mother of the arsonist.<eos> What?<eos> Oh! Ass!<eos> Don't.<eos> All right, I need an arsonist spouse or something.<eos> - So you're gettin'scooped like every morning.<eos> I mean, do you have any kind of plan?<eos> Yes, the show will still...
I've taken a job.<eos> That's good.<eos> - I have to go to LA.<eos> - Get out of London.<eos> - Yeah, it doesn't suit me.<eos> - Right.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> There's something I have to do first.<eos> But you'll come to America?<eos> Yeah, I will.
I reject your proposal.<eos> I don't want to not make plans with you.<eos> I want to make plans with you.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah. I do.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> In all my life, I never thought I'd see you down on one knee.<eos> Yeah, it's getting a bit damp down here, so... What's it to be, Anna from Boston?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
The key to the White House. It's him, the Japanese diplomat.<eos> They fed him something.<eos> The kitchen was like a laboratory. Calm down.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Operation Casablanca isn't Casablanca, Morocco.<eos> It's the White House in Washington, the "Casa Blanca".<eos> The White House in Arabic, understand?<eos> He's contaminated.<eos> He's going to die.<eos> They all will.
Uh, sorry, Glen. Um-- I've gotta grab Andy before he rushes off.<eos> Tamara's asked him to do up her house. Why?<eos> She knows how hard he works for me.<eos> Is this all his fan mail? Yeah.<eos> I do a couple of sessions a week to keep on top of it.<eos> Pretty good at forging Nick's signature.<eos> Why don't we have a proper chat about it?<eos> Always used to help Nicholas-- You'd do that?<eos> You have time?<eos> I'll just, uh...
- David, I've been trying tο see yοu.<eos> - I've been terribly busy.<eos> - Dοing what?<eos> - Kinging.<eos> Really?<eos> Kinging is a a precariοus business these days. Where's the Russian tsar? - Where's cοusin Wilhelm?<eos> - Yοu're being dreary.<eos> Is kinging laying οff 80... staff and buying mοre pearls fοr Wallis, while peοple are marching acrοss Eurοpe singing The Red Flag?<eos> - Herr Hitler will sοrt them οut.<eos> - Whο will sοrt οut Herr Hitler?
Hello, Mr Raul?<eos> This is Nuno Silva speaking.<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> And yourself?<eos> I'm already here... in the parking lot.<eos> I needed you to come down here, if you would.<eos> I know it's awkward.<eos> Yes...<eos> Of course.<eos> You will?
I'm not that person anymore{\*, Matt}.<eos> I know it's hard to understand.<eos> {\pos(260,270)}<eos> - We got what we needed. Let's go.<eos> - {\*You're not going}You won't go anywhere.<eos> {\pos(240,220)}You leave with Sylar, people are gonna end up dead.<eos> {\pos(240,220)}{\*And }That'll be on you.<eos> I can't let that happen.<eos> Let's go.<eos> {\pos(260,268)}{\*I'm not going}I won't anywhere.
How you doing, Brantrell?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Doing good?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine, man.<eos> You know. - How's your mama?<eos> - She's good, she's fine.<eos> Yeah? Tell her I said hi, your sister too.<eos> - Yeah yeah.<eos> Come see us.<eos> - I will, I will.
Weare in love.<eos> Struck by lightning.<eos> Leaning one does not.<eos> I'm not a bitch, Madame.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Or Should I stay?<eos> No.<eos> Come on, Doris, go with your mother.<eos> Grant mirAsyl please!<eos> - You will!
I will not have you waste your talent.<eos> Well, it wouldn't be a waste.<eos> It pays.<eos> And what difference does it make?<eos> Who cares where the money comes from?<eos> I care.<eos> This is not what I trained you for.<eos> And what the hell did you train me for?<eos> Do you think that life on the other side of that wall will bring you happiness? - Trust me!<eos> it won't.
Well, justice is... Well, it starts wars.<eos> An eye for an eye for an eye.<eos> It takes a turning of the cheek for this species to evolve.<eos> So, you're the one who knows what it's going to take for the human species to evolve.<eos> Just regurgitating what people a lot smarter than me have been saying for a long, long time.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look what I found.<eos> Take it.<eos> That ought to boost your blood sugar.<eos> No, it won't.
Everybody knows about global warming.<eos> Congratulations. It just really too bad nobody really gives a shit.<eos> Ev,<eos> I'll give you all of your mother's money.<eos> - No more monthly payments?<eos> - That's right.<eos> There are some students coming up from Dawson...<eos> I'll save you a seat.<eos> Hey, Evy, get in the car!<eos> Uh, I'll...
You tell me the truth, what do we get?<eos> Help me out here.<eos> You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.<eos> I knew it!<eos> PS3, definitely PS3.<eos> Who would pick a mountain bike?<eos> Enough with the guilt, Ma.<eos> We'll still see each other.<eos> I'll come over every night and have dinner with you.<eos> The hell you will!
There's no way to trace it back.<eos> He wants us to succeed.<eos> - He wants Renfrew out of jail.<eos> - Where he can get him. To silence him.<eos> Yes.<eos> Which means Renfrew is telling the truth. - He has the goods on Red John.<eos> - Slow down. We don't have anything yet.<eos> Yes, we still have to get Renfrew out of jail first.<eos> - Oh, that's all.<eos> - And we will.
I was young and scared, heartbroken over you.<eos> And CeCe kept pressuring me.<eos> And the truth is, I wasn't ready to have a baby.<eos> And it's been a hole in my life ever since.<eos> I understand why you gave him up.<eos> - But it's that you didn't tell me.<eos> - Rufus, please.<eos> I don't hate you, Lil.<eos> As much as I want to.<eos> Neither will your kids.
Pernille?<eos> Frederik?<eos> Pernille!<eos> - I thought that the road was here.<eos> - Now will you come here!<eos> Pernille!<eos> Come on, run.<eos> Pernille!<eos> Do as I say.<eos> I will soon.
Sure, I'll come back.<eos> Well<eos> You know what?<eos> I found your ring.<eos> Not true? Where?<eos> Between the couch cushions.<eos> Areyouhappy?<eos> Yes<eos> I'm back.<eos> I will.
A cigar? I know you smoke.<eos> - I was advised against your cigars.<eos> I see.<eos> Would you excuse me for a moment?<eos> Mr. Sieger was satisfied.<eos> You'll report to him here every Thursday.<eos> You are to present him with a prioritized list of three names.<eos> Your first candidate must be ready for a meeting.<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> You won't.
It's killing my dog!<eos> He's got my neck!<eos> Oh, my god! My dog is dead!<eos> Maybe that's why he was tied up.<eos> Meg, will you take one of these and pass it down, please?<eos> What's this?<eos> I'm starting a new advocacy group.<eos> The quahog animal equal rights league.<eos> Our first meeting is tomorrow night, And I'd really appreciate it if you guys Would come and show your support.<eos> Well, of course we will, Brian.
Double shift, remember?<eos> So I won't see you till tomorrow.<eos> Are you gonna be okay?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I got dinner.<eos> Honey, can you just clean up a little bit?<eos> I'll try.<eos> Don't expect much.<eos> Okay. I'll do it when I get home.<eos> You will?
I already told you.<eos> I want another chance.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> Did you really expect me to get all swoony just because you showed up?<eos> - No, I thought you might at least...<eos> - What, still care? Look...<eos> Hunter, you had your chance, okay?<eos> Three years ago, I was yours.<eos> - Now I want you to go.<eos> - And what if I won't, Trish?
I'm gonna separate Davis from the beast and send Doomsday to the Phantom Zone.<eos> Spare me the Kryptonian mumbo jumbo.<eos> You have to bend the rules on this one.<eos> When I took Davis to the Fortress, you stopped me from sending him away.<eos> - You knew he was worth saving.<eos> - I was wrong.<eos> No, you weren't wrong, Chloe.<eos> I know what you've been through, but there's still a side of Davis that's human.<eos> So then what if the plan fails?<eos> It won't.
I just did what I had to do.<eos> No,no.You...you kicked ass.<eos> I'm not like that.<eos> I'm good,but not like you.I'm not... good under pressure.<eos> She's really sick-- really sick-- and I'm not good under pressure.<eos> But even when our hopes give way to reality and we finally have to surrender to the truth... it just means we've lost today's battle... could I have another,please?<eos> Not tomorrow's war.<eos> So I guess a big wedding won't be that bad.<eos> I'm just sad 'cause I didn't get a chance to see you in the actual dress.<eos> -You will.
He's still in a coma from his tractor accident.<eos> - Oh, I wanna go see Francis.<eos> - Don't be such a baby.<eos> Fine, I'll do it, but not today.<eos> I mean, how heartless would it be to break up With someone five months before their birthday?<eos> - Jules!<eos> - Okay!<eos> The follow-through is looking much better, Gladys.<eos> You go, Gladys, you're gonna get it in one day.<eos> - She never will.
-Give the Chancellor my regards.<eos> -Now, wait a minute!<eos> I agree.<eos> Report back here when you are finished.<eos> This could be a trap, Master.<eos> You sure you don't need us to go?<eos> (CHUCKLING) Of course it's a trap, Skywalker.<eos> I will contact you when we find the children.<eos> -What if they don't find those kids?<eos> -They will, Snips.
Mr D'Urberville whistled to them this morning, ma'am.<eos> No wonder they're subdued.<eos> Pretty airs are what's needed, Tess.<eos> Can you manage it, do you think?<eos> Damn and blast it!<eos> Was there ever a more beautiful sight on God's earth, Tess, than watching you whistle?<eos> I could stand here all day watching you - pouting and swearing to yourself.<eos> - I did not swear!<eos> - Perhaps I will give you a lesson...<eos> - No, you will not!
Bye, Teacher.<eos> When Master comes out of seclusion, please say bye for me.<eos> I will, go now.<eos> Teacher, why didn't he come?<eos> Who?<eos> Who is he?<eos> Oh he!<eos> Not coming!<eos> He'll come...<eos> He won't...
So, if this man was guilty, why did they let him go?<eos> Not enough evidence.<eos> He must have bribed the witnesses, or threatened them.<eos> Or perhaps he was innocent.<eos> That monster?<eos> Never!<eos> Might one know your name, monsieur?<eos> My name, monsieur is er... ..Lagnier.<eos> Goodness, where can she have got to?<eos> I'll...
THE DOOR OF THE LAME TOWER<eos> A girl like me, who likes to sleep in, has few reasons to wake up early.<eos> There's nothing like a break-up to deprive you of sleep.<eos> - These are our pictures.<eos> - We can't both have 'em!<eos> I'll make doubles and give you the negatives.<eos> - Why can't I do that?<eos> - Because you won't.
-I have proof, you know.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Shit.<eos> -Huh?<eos> How far are you gone?<eos> -I came from Blönduós.<eos> No...when are you due? -Oh.<eos> I'm such a mongo.<eos> They'll come in 2 weeks.<eos> -Who will?
I'm glad I was there.<eos> Me too.<eos> [PAUL SIGHS]<eos> Maybe today's the day you're gonna see those ponies.<eos> - The bankers?<eos> - Hmm.<eos> Okay, honestly, they don't come this far down the island, ever.<eos> - But thank you.<eos> - You'll see.<eos> One day they will.
Like a...<eos> Like a sacrifice.<eos> It has something to do with the ruins.<eos> Now that we're here, they won't let us leave.<eos> So, what do we do, just wait for someone to find us?<eos> Who?<eos> The Greeks.<eos> Dimitri left them a copy of the map before we left.<eos> Yeah, and what if they decide not to come, Jeff?<eos> Then somebody else will.
And I see you're still doing your stunts.<eos> Big time.<eos> Actually...<eos> Here.<eos> Peep the strategy.<eos> You're jumping the pool?<eos> Wow!<eos> Yeah, it's the real deal.<eos> You should come.<eos> Maybe I will.
I will take back what is mine.<eos> Knut...<eos> I can understand if you don't want to get involved, but I can't stop thinking of Cecilia.<eos> Cecilia Algots-daughter.<eos> She is promised to someone else.<eos> I will be king.<eos> If I can count on your support, you can count on me.<eos> - How do you know that he will come?<eos> - He will, I am sure.<eos> He will.
No offense, but that gizmo's not showing a whole lot of promise right now.<eos> It'll work.<eos> I just wasn't ready for this.<eos> I'm probably not going to make it either way. No.<eos> Don't you start to talk like that.<eos> Cam, we have to face the fact that I am going to die here.<eos> No, I don't have to face that fact, because I am not going to let it happen.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> But the truth is, even if you manage to create a distraction and destroy the device, you are never going to get me to the gate by yourself.<eos> - Yes, I will.
It isn't done yet, but...<eos> Do you like it?<eos> It's quite beautiful.<eos> It is, isn't it?<eos> You know, Clara, your mother might appreciate a new dress.<eos> For material.<eos> I know just what to buy.<eos> Thank you, Papa!<eos> I'll make her the best dress in Lawrence.<eos> Yes, you will.
- No.<eos> - No.<eos> No, I didn't think so.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> What's life without a few dragons?<eos> Everything's going to change now, isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Promise you'll write this summer.<eos> Both of you.<eos> I won't.
I'm so cold.<eos> Where's Aslan?<eos> What have they done?<eos> But we saw the knife.<eos> The Witch. If the Witch knew the true meaning of sacrifice, she might have interpreted the Deep Magic differently.<eos> That when a willing victim who has committed no treachery is killed in a traitor's stead, the Stone Table will crack and even death itself will turn backwards.<eos> We sent the news that you were dead.<eos> Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.<eos> We have to help them.<eos> We will, dear one, but not alone.
Don't bother, Ishtar, even the dunes have moved.<eos> Anyway, I have what I need.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I don't want to go there anymore.<eos> Come on.<eos> I want to go back.<eos> We'll go back.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bab'Aziz, won't you go to the gathering after all?<eos> I will, my little angel. I will.
Can't catch me out. That showed 'em who's boss.<eos> Three days, eight hours and 47 minutes.<eos> So that got rid of her... 23 hours and 13 minutes quicker than the last one.<eos> I think the turning point was definitely eating the baby.<eos> Well done, Eric.<eos> Mr Brown, are you all right?<eos> I'm perfectly all right.<eos> Evangeline, could you let Cook know that the new nanny has had to leave and I'm off to the agency to find a new one?<eos> Good.<eos> I'll just...
It's me, move over.<eos> No, man. Go find one of the other empty seats.<eos> - Where's your sister?<eos> - Dear Brother!<eos> - Fanny!<eos> Christine... If I were to leave, I wouldn't even know where to go.<eos> Then why leave?<eos> That's what I'm sayin'.<eos> I don't wanna leave.<eos> - All right, I won't.
No, Jin-tae!<eos> I won't go alone<eos> - Just go<eos> - No way!<eos> - Get up and come with me<eos> - Listen<eos> I will surrender and come home after the war<eos> I was making shoes I'd give to you when you go to college<eos> I haven't finished them so I won't die, Hurry!<eos> - I won't!
SEE YOU TONIGHT<eos> NELLY LOPEZ VISITING NURSE<eos> DR. MANUEL LOPEZ EVERY AFTERNOON<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Hush!<eos> Dad's sleeping.<eos> What do you want, honey?<eos> You promised we'd go to the sea.<eos> We will.
To want to be a nurse?<eos> Even... a slow girl like me?<eos> I didn't mean it like that.<eos> No innate skill... so I stuck him... over and over.<eos> Over... and over...<eos> -and over-- -l'm sorry!<eos> Please give me the syringe.<eos> You can't take back... what's been said.<eos> Want me to practice?<eos> Then I will.
It's the first time I'm talking about this.<eos> I've never talked to anyone about this.<eos> Koby, Koby.<eos> Haven't spoken to him in 10 years.<eos> Get your arm up.<eos> Go get Mordechay.<eos> We're going off to the city of Dervichen To buy a turkey.<eos> Carful coachman, the basket torn, the turkey will fly away.<eos> Hey, Menny, you'll come to my exhibition, won't you?<eos> Of course I will.
- I'm doing it for your sake.<eos> - For my sake?<eos> For you and your children.<eos> After it's all over, the world will be a better place.<eos> Please, Dad.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Jane, I don't expect you to understand now.<eos> But one day you will.
Porthos doesn't try and eat me when I'm late with his dinner.<eos> Vulcan children are never late with their sehlat's dinner.<eos> I can believe that.<eos> The Captain asked me to re-examine the DNA from the bomb... to see if anyone else might have handled it.<eos> -You say you found an anomaly.<eos> -ln these chromosomal fragments.<eos> Here and here.<eos> -What kind of anomaly?<eos> -These are telomeres.<eos> A genetic clock, if you will.
- That's not bad.<eos> - Fourth time's the charm.<eos> Very handy little sheet.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> Off the Internet.<eos> You can find anything there.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Do you want to keep it, the diagram?<eos> I don't think I'll be needing it much around the dorm.<eos> In that case, I will.
It doesn't work on you either.<eos> I meant it wasn't gonna let you die.<eos> It is a coincidence that it stopped working now.<eos> I need a drink.<eos> Go.<eos> You always told me I shouldn't be afraid of the dark.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I can't sleep now.<eos> What if the darkness comes?<eos> (Teyla) It won't.
More sex?<eos> More power?<eos> More control?<eos> That's what she'd have you believe.<eos> But when Mr Stone came to her, or rather when she came to Mr Stone, what my client really wanted was readers.<eos> He wanted people to read what he wrote.<eos> He's a writer.<eos> That's what writers want. An audience.<eos> An audience for his words, for his vision.<eos> For his truth, if you will.
Teach me something.<eos> - I'm not teaching you anything.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You're a bright, innocent, beautiful girl and I'm not gonna screw that up like everything else.<eos> Really?<eos> - What?<eos> - You think that?<eos> That I'm beautiful?<eos> No.<eos> Then why won't you?
-Maybe you know her. -No, I don't. Such a good person!<eos> Such a nice man!<eos> -Thank you. -I'm sorry. Listen, this might sound like a crazy thing to say, but I don't think your brother jumped on his own.<eos> -Someone...<eos> -Don't be absurd!<eos> -I'm sorry. -Please, take her away.<eos> Officer, take her away. I'm sorry, Doctor.<eos> We need to identify the body.<eos> -Is your brother coming?<eos> -No, I will.
You want to kill yourself?<eos> Easy.<eos> This is a typical bodyguard situation.<eos> I'd even marry you.<eos> But not before next spring.<eos> Hello.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Franz.<eos> Relax.<eos> Will you,
All right, I give up.<eos> Hey, big guy, you want to do the popcorn machine?<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> Pop, pop, pop, pop...<eos> Yeah, see, now he smiles.<eos> Okay, let's get you ready for the fair, okay?<eos> I'm telling you, it's not gonna fit.<eos> Nothing fits anymore.<eos> If he keeps growing at this rate, we're gonna have to send him to college by next week.<eos> Well, he will in these.
I love that poem.<eos> It was helpful. Especially the part about not being alone.<eos> That's when I knew I'd never met Clancy Lass before.<eos> I don't know if anyone in my family had.<eos> I brought home a stray cat once.<eos> You're not a baby, George.<eos> I think you're old enough to see our side of this.<eos> We can take him to an animal shelter.<eos> - They'll kill him!<eos> - They won't.
And we'll either find the orbs, or we'll find the shot that took 'em.<eos> Or, perhaps we could persuade Talikaa to return the energy orbs.<eos> Let's 'persuade' her with a pulse rifle.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> I'm just... dizzy.<eos> You know what the worst part of this is?<eos> You and me.<eos> We never could get it together.<eos> Now we never will.
Are you sure you don't want me to turn it off?<eos> - Try this one.<eos> - I love you. I love your cooking... but I swear if you make me eat one more bite of broccoli tart... I will beat you to death with it.<eos> Your mother is the pickiest woman I have ever catered for.<eos> She has impeccable taste, the highest standards... and she can smell an inferior tart a mile away.<eos> Depending on how long it's been left out, we all can.<eos> - She still hasn't called yet.<eos> - She will.<eos> But she was supposed to call about the details a couple of days ago.<eos> - She will.
As far as that goes, we may have a little problem.<eos> You will suffer gravely.<eos> Yeah, I figured as much.<eos> Although I am consoled by the fact that we succeeded in destroying the power source for your new weapon.<eos> You are in no position to gloat.<eos> We just wiped out your single advantage you had over the Goa'uld.<eos> I would say that's about as good a reason as any.<eos> Enough.<eos> - I won't tell you anything.<eos> - Oh, yes, you will.
Sure there are.<eos> In the drawer where your pistol was.<eos> You just put your prints all over them.<eos> You attacked me, I fought back.<eos> If something should happen...<eos> I don't care how long it takes.<eos> I only have to hit you once. Just one good hit and it's over.<eos> He bleeds.<eos> You can count on one thing, baby. Even if I don't kill you, you'll never see Gracie again.<eos> You never will.
You lied to me!<eos> And because you don't believe in fairies...<eos> Tink's light is going out!<eos> [Gasps] Tinker Bell?<eos> [Pirates laughing]<eos> JANE:<eos> No.<eos> Peter, I...<eos> I'll save you, Peter!<eos> I will!
- I'm not going.<eos> This is my flat!<eos> - You must obey me.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Here it is.<eos> The old man that lived here died a few weeks ago.<eos> These are his things.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> I'm gonna live here?<eos> - Yes, you will.
Not only the old suffer from that.<eos> But it's not one of my complaints.<eos> - Why are you standing there?<eos> - Nobody's asked me in.<eos> I came to tell you about a job.<eos> Some guys shooting a music video need a doctor.<eos> Care to earn some money?<eos> Small sums no longer interest me.<eos> You won't come?<eos> I will.
I had been working for the people I thought I was fighting.<eos> So I went to the only place that could help me take them down.<eos> Now I'm a double agent for the CIA.<eos> My handler is Michael Vaughn.<eos> Only one other person knows what I do, another double agent inside SD-6.<eos> Someone I hardly know.<eos> My father.<eos> Francie... will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, Charlie, I will!
Lulu!<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> Well, it's an unfortunate slip-up.<eos> I told you, it's a dangerous journey.<eos> You never answered the chaplain's question.<eos> I never answered your question.<eos> Ask me again.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.
If not for me, be honest for your own sake.<eos> Don't lose yourself because of me.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> You don't have to say anything.<eos> All you have to do to free yourself is admit how you truly feel about me.<eos> In your heart.<eos> How could you be so sure?<eos> I had a feeling.<eos> I do love you.<eos> And I always will.
- Open it.<eos> Open it.<eos> Better let me go in first.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Knowing Captain Archer, he's probably rigged the place with booby traps.<eos> Just give me a few minutes to check it out.<eos> No.<eos> You could have a weapon hidden in there.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Not without me, you won't.
- That's cool with me.<eos> - Sookie and Jackson?<eos> - That would be fun.<eos> - And Grandma and Grandpa?<eos> - Oh, no. Come on.<eos> It's your graduation.<eos> They should be there.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> They won't want to be there.<eos> - Of course they will.
- So this is my fault?<eos> - And you have Dean.<eos> - This is his fault?<eos> I don't know why.<eos> I just wanted to do it.<eos> I just wanted to try it.<eos> And I don't feel like I should justify or explain it to you...<eos> - Then don't.<eos> - Fine.<eos> I won't.
See you at seven.<eos> Hold a moment, Lorelai.<eos> Do you know where Christopher is?<eos> - We wanted him to come with you and Rory tomorrow, even though apparently Rory's getting back Saturday, though I couldn't sworn it was tomorrow.<eos> Christopher's away on business but I'll tell him you invited him.<eos> And tell him to come with you two next week.<eos> I wanna see the three of you together.<eos> - Yes, that would be a nice picture.<eos> - All right, see you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
- She tells me I'm having a boy...<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Miranda!<eos> - You're having a boy!<eos> - You see?<eos> That.<eos> That's what she wanted, but I couldn't get it up so I faked it.<eos> What does a fake sonogram look like in case I ever need to do it?<eos> Everyone is glowing about my pregnancy.<eos> When will I?
- No, Verrazano Salvage, ask for Gene.<eos> Don't forget the fireplace mantles and the wall sconces.<eos> Downtown, the yuppies pay top dollar.<eos> We're on it, Ton', don't worry.<eos> Assemblyman. What brings you to beautiful downtown Newark?<eos> Meeting with one of my constituents.<eos> You going to be at the Bing tomorrow?<eos> - I don't know yet.<eos> Maybe I'll see you over there then.<eos> Maybe you will.
I'll be at my mom's till tomorrow.<eos> Tell me you got something.<eos> As you asked, I compared the wounds inflicted on your son... with the wounds on these two women.<eos> And? There are similarities... between the trajectory of the wounds... and the force with which they were delivered.<eos> Meaning Regali's the guy.<eos> Meaning that it was a brilliant forensic deduction... on Cadet Hayes's part.<eos> But that's all it is.<eos> The killer used different weapons... he demonstrated no consistent M.O.<eos> And no clear victimology. None of it will hold up in court.<eos> Well, something out there will.
That's my part, Christian!<eos> Don't you dare!<eos> The magic sitar, who can only speak the truth, says:<eos> "The greatest thing you 'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."<eos> A picnic, sweet lady?<eos> Oh, but we have so much work to do.<eos> If the writer can carry a basket, you can both do it in my presence.<eos> -So he falls from the roof--<eos> -Yes, I know, I know. Don't tell me.<eos> "The greatest thing you'll ever..."
Over there.<eos> Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.<eos> My daughter is going to cross the living room.<eos> All right, Anne.<eos> Darling, mummy can't be with you all the time.<eos> You must learn to be on your own.<eos> Where's your rosary?<eos> Whenever you feel afraid... I want you to squeeze it with all your might and say an Our Father.<eos> And then your fear will go away.<eos> - It won't.
This is really nice of you to do this for me.<eos> And I'm sorry if I went too far, but I did need this ride.<eos> So I really appreciate it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Right here.<eos> What do you plan to do with that?<eos> Commit a heinous crime. What else?<eos> You'll wait for me, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Of course you will.
Go!<eos> Where is she?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> We have to look and find her.<eos> The wolves come out at night.<eos> We have to move on before it gets too cold.<eos> - I promised her.<eos> - It's too dangerous here.<eos> We have to go.<eos> - I won't.
Let the lady gather information.<eos> But...<eos> My responsibility.<eos> Roger.<eos> You have permission.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Father.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Promise me you'll come back alive.<eos> I will.
We all know.<eos> Isn't it, Iris?<eos> No, it isn't, but you can think what you like.<eos> You know nothing about it. Nobody knows but me.<eos> And... I'm not telling.<eos> I thought it was a secret.<eos> I mean, I know Iris doesn't want it talked about.<eos> Come on, Iris. I'm sure we'll all recognize ourselves.<eos> I don't see how you... anyone... can.<eos> They won't.
Cheers.<eos> Are your parents really away?<eos> Somebody's always gotta bang the glass.<eos> This year it's me.<eos> I wanted all of you to be here for what I'm about to do, which is probably going to be one of the most embarrassing moments ever.<eos> This thing is burning a hole in my pocket.<eos> The last stop, baby.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, Charlie, I will.
Can I talk to you guys for a second?<eos> I give up.<eos> Whatever you want, you can have it.<eos> You want to sing a song or do a dance?<eos> You want your mom at the altar screaming racial slurs?<eos> I don't care.<eos> I just want to thank you guys for what you did for my parents.<eos> They're so happy to be a part of your special day.<eos> Tell them we're glad they're coming.<eos> I will.
I've long ago given up any hope of getting into her psychotic good graces.<eos> But that woman is horrible and selfish.<eos> She cannot get away with this.<eos> - I won't let her.<eos> - You're talking about my mother.<eos> Your mother, the one who stepped in without being asked... and single-handedly wrecked everything.<eos> What is this about?<eos> She'll never come back here.<eos> - Who, Mother?<eos> Of course she will.
Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> You say yes, I'll bring you back to Em City.<eos> Basketball tournament?<eos> More of an exhibition match.<eos> Best of three games.<eos> - Here we go again.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - What if something goes wrong?<eos> - Nothing will.
- Good. Now we agree.<eos> Aren't there other patients you need to be seeing?<eos> Me? No, I've been off for two hours.<eos> So with your precious free time, you've been talking to an old lady.<eos> What about your list?<eos> How many have you done?<eos> For that matter, how many times have you sat on the grass and done nothing?<eos> You need to start taking some time for yourself.<eos> Promise me you'll do that.<eos> - l will.
Sounds good.<eos> Do we not deserve that, Pelle?<eos> Aren't we worth it, when we've worked so hard?<eos> Only a few more metres!<eos> A new day is dawning!<eos> Come on!<eos> There's a time for everything, Thomas.<eos> There's a time for everything.<eos> Your time will come, Thomas.<eos> It will.
The ball moved.<eos> No.<eos> It moved.<eos> I have to call a stroke on myself.<eos> No!<eos> No, don't do it!<eos> please don't do it.<eos> only you and me seen it, and I won't tell a soul. I promise.<eos> Nobody will know.<eos> I will, Hardy.
Marion!<eos> Marion?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're in a hospital. - Marion? - Who's that?<eos> She'll be sent for.<eos> She'll come.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> No, she won't.
If something happened to her, I couldn't live.<eos> - Leave me out of it.<eos> - Don't exaggerate.<eos> No, I've decided.<eos> There, like that...<eos> Look at that!<eos> A ditch in the track, or something like that...<eos> - And how will I go to school?<eos> - You won't! - And Dad to work?<eos> - He won't either.
Quite wonderful.<eos> Lord Edgware was there that night, and I saw how he behaved.<eos> He was a brute of a man.<eos> Despicable.<eos> I can't help but think that he deserved what he got... although that's a terrible thing to say.<eos> I won't lie to you, Mr Poirot.<eos> I'm glad at the way things worked out.<eos> And as soon as there's been a decent interval, Jane and I plan to be married.<eos> If she'll have me.<eos> Of course I will.
"Mucho obrigado, Signorita!"<eos> - Tell him that if you go, I go.<eos> - That'd be stupid.<eos> It's a stupid job.<eos> Why should I stay if you're not here?<eos> And if you're not here Jørgen Mortensen won't come anymore.<eos> If he goes, I go.<eos> - Will you translate?<eos> - No.<eos> Will you?
Can't it be someone else?<eos> No, it can't.<eos> - Shut up, bitch!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> I'm not going to the army.<eos> See, he says he's not going. - Stop taking pictures, fatso!<eos> Well done, Harvey!<eos> Cool!<eos> I won't go to the army!<eos> I won't!
- They live inside me?<eos> - Inside your cells, yes.<eos> - And we are symbionts with them.<eos> - Symbionts?<eos> Life-forms living together for mutual advantage.<eos> Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist... and we would have no knowledge of the Force.<eos> They continually speak to us... telling us the will of the Force.<eos> When you learn to quiet your mind... you'll hear them speaking to you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> With time and training, Ani, you will.
You ate my bird.<eos> Was that the surface?<eos> No, the vibrations are too deep.<eos> That was from inside.<eos> I wouldn't get that close.<eos> Just a suggestion.<eos> Water's murky.<eos> We might make it.<eos> No way!<eos> No, we won't!
And your soul?<eos> It's looking pallid.<eos> Spring is green. - Ate too much salad!<eos> What do I do with it?<eos> You put water<eos> Water? Fill it up?<eos> To write?<eos> - No. No, for the salad...<eos> If I eat too much salad?<eos> But I won't
And you accepted them.<eos> See? Eroding the neighborhood values.<eos> He was thanking me for the physician, which he is very happy with.<eos> Really?<eos> What does that do to property values? Having a gangster living next door?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Safest block in the neighb.<eos> Being a gangster, what's that mean?<eos> The shit I see in the boardroom, I don't know if I'd make a distinction.<eos> Oh, will you, please?
Where did you get it?<eos> I'm not telling. Especially after this reaction.<eos> Why did you tell me?<eos> You were honest with me today.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> It got too scary.<eos> Jesus, right under my nose.<eos> You'd think you'd know.<eos> No, Dad.<eos> You won't.
I was called in to consult by a garbage-hauling company I represent.<eos> What's the story with Triborough Towers?<eos> The manager wants the contract with Dick, but this Kolar Sanitation....<eos> Another nationwide company.<eos> The Kolar brothers.<eos> Czechoslovakian immigrants or some shit.<eos> These Polacks will haul paper, plastic and aluminum for 7000 a month less than Dick.<eos> They pay us 40 times the monthly for stealing a stop.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> They won't.
As long as you carry Goa'uld technology... ..he will know our position.<eos> Great.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I don't see them and they're not moving.<eos> Either the Goa'uld got them or they're playing games.<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> It's a trap.<eos> - I will go.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - I will.
We could detonate the C4.<eos> No, Trofsky is gonna start shooting any minute.<eos> We gotta buy some time.<eos> - He thinks I'm a Goa'uld, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Blow that C4 the minute the cavalry comes through that gate.<eos> - What if they don't?<eos> - What if they don't?<eos> They will... They will.
Her brother Dadan is a war criminal.<eos> He'll exterminate our family.<eos> He'll drink our blood.<eos> - But she's a midget.<eos> O mirror, the dead with the dead the living with the living, the children with their father.<eos> For two months.<eos> Then you get a divorce.<eos> ...the dead with the dead...<eos> I don't want to marry.<eos> I won't.
Brian was gonna quit, but they fired him before he could.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm not gonna do what everyone thinks I'm gonna do...<eos> Flip out, man!<eos> All I wanna know is... who's coming with me?<eos> Who's coming, man?<eos> Who's coming with me?<eos> Who's coming with me, man?<eos> I will.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Is that you, Simon?<eos> Simon, is that you?<eos> Let me have the phone.<eos> Who is this? Answer me!<eos> Who is this?<eos> Hello?<eos> This is the FBI. We have this number and we will trace it.<eos> Who is this?<eos> No, you won't.
it was like...<eos> Soul mates.<eos> but it exists.<eos> like twin souls.<eos> Tuned in to each other.<eos> even in death.<eos> You're reaching each other through her painting.<eos> It's nothing I've ever seen.<eos> can you?<eos> And you never will.
"remember..."<eos> "'i watched it with full-sized eyes...'" "'i caressed it with both hands.'"<eos> "I am here waiting for you, trembling."<eos> "Share this day with me"<eos> Alexandros!<eos> Anna... Wanna dance?<eos> I know that you're avoiding it, but today is my day.<eos> Anna, I won't go to the hospital.<eos> I won't go to the hospital, Anna.<eos> I won't.
Pal, if you don't mind why not sleep in my place for a night?<eos> Let's have a drink till dawn<eos> Why not? If only you don't think this is a nuisance<eos> You're welcome<eos> You are giving me face to stay, aren't you?<eos> I am so happy!<eos> Honey, is the fish ready?<eos> It's already fixed! I'll send it out right away<eos> Come and drink with Ma<eos> Sure I will
Oh, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far.<eos> How about we play for more money?<eos> Say 150?<eos> One hundred and fifty dollars.<eos> Say 200?<eos> Two hundred dollars.<eos> You're doing it again.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Monica, I don't want to lose $200.<eos> - We won't. - Okay.
- And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.<eos> - You really think so? Of course she will.<eos> They're women, they had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.<eos> Hey hey hey. What's goin down ya'll?<eos> Hey Fat Abbot, what are you doing on this side of the hood?<eos> You know something Rudy? - You're like school in summertime.<eos> - School in summertime?<eos> Yeah bitch! School in summer time!<eos> Open your fucking ass nigga hole or I'll pop your bitch ass!<eos> - I'll a poppa yo a bitcha assa tuba.
(mouths)<eos> As long as they think I'm him, I have access, but I'm gonna need your help.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Uh, what was what?<eos> - This may not be a secure line.<eos> - Mulder, uh, where are you?<eos> I'd better not say.<eos> Look, just get out here as soon as you can.<eos> - How can I get in touch with you?<eos> - You won't.
It was nothing. Just a false alarm.<eos> Try not to actually chew.<eos> Wouldn't it be great if we could be alone together?<eos> Just relaxed, you and me?<eos> It would be so great.<eos> That would be so great. Let's hang in.<eos> You never know what's gonna happen.<eos> Come on. Open wide.<eos> Ken, turn the Yankee game off and come on out here now!<eos> I will!
Yes, it's the big day soon.<eos> When is it exactly?<eos> Friday at three.<eos> In three days time.<eos> You're not too anxious?<eos> I feel unbelievably relaxed.<eos> It's my sister who's all worked up.<eos> And my father's making a six-hour train journey to hear a thesis on yeomen in the year 1000 at Paladru Lake.<eos> He'll nod off after five minutes.<eos> Everyone else probably will too.
How the hell you been?<eos> I gotta know. You still humping that Finnish stewardess with the bad skin?<eos> Tom, are you still trading stolen cars on the black market?<eos> Hey, Alek... you watched CNN during Desert Storm.<eos> Remember all those television shots from the nose cone of the GBU missiles slamming into those trucks?<eos> Remember that picture? How it kept getting closer and bigger on the screen?<eos> You just about see the faces of those drivers and then zap, the picture went dead.<eos> We didn't get to see what happened next.<eos> Well, guess what, Alek?<eos> You will, you son of a bitch.
- All right, what?<eos> - We need to laugh.<eos> What we need is one good, dirty joke.<eos> Disgusting dirty.<eos> Anybody feel they could use that kind of joke?<eos> Yeah!<eos> I'm talking filthy!<eos> This is all under protest now. This is a warm-up act.<eos> - They still have to laugh at the joke.<eos> - And I won't.
It should go out today.<eos> Cancel it.<eos> They cut off the phone this morning.<eos> I can't.<eos> Post office!<eos> What do I pay you for?<eos> Well, you haven't paid me for...<eos> Yeah, right...<eos> Won't work. Never mind.<eos> - What won't?
Reminds me of Madame de Stal, "Love is above the law, above the opinion of men:<eos> the State, the flame, the ideal story of the modern world."<eos> Give me the chocolate bar.<eos> Does anybody else feel like your heart is about to leap out of your chest?<eos> Yes.<eos> My heart is about to leap out of my chest.<eos> And I want everybody to hear this.<eos> Ilene, I've known you were the one for me ever since we teed off on the moderate-to-difficult course at the "Putt-Putt Panorama."<eos> Ilene Markham, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, she will!

Run!<eos> Stand back!<eos> Not out there!<eos> Kill her, Larsen.<eos> No!<eos> Now please, let me explain.<eos> - Please?<eos> - Explain?<eos> Karen!<eos> Will you...?
Is that the best you can do?<eos> Mary, are you hurt? Did they wound you?<eos> Oh, Mary.<eos> What have they done?<eos> We will avenge you.<eos> Rob will kill every last one of them.<eos> He will not know.<eos> Rob will not know.<eos> Mary, Rob must know.<eos> He will not! He will not!

You can't leave Jill's party in the middle.<eos> The middle of the party?<eos> When was the beginning?<eos> Can't you be late a couple days?<eos> The statue's not gonna run away.<eos> Tim, it's a big job.<eos> I can't blow off Olaf.<eos> You know, this is unbelievable. I came all this way and now my sister won't even know I was here.<eos> Yeah, wait a minute.<eos> Yes, she will.
- Yes.<eos> Breasts are a dime a dozen. Good teeth are hard to find.<eos> But I find out my girl go to spring formal with other guy.<eos> What I should do?<eos> You should forget about her.<eos> I mean, look at you, man.<eos> You're the biggest hunk in Chicago.<eos> You should be bagging more panties than a clerk at Victoria's Secret.<eos> Or if you don't wanna be popping penicillin for life you ask your special girl if she'll go steady and hope she says yes.<eos> Oh, she will.
I'm desperately sorry.<eos> I do care for you.<eos> You're my dearest friend.<eos> - But I can't go be a wife.<eos> - You say you won't, but ...<eos> - You Will !<eos> - I won't, I won't.<eos> One day ... ... you'llmeetsomeman, and you Will love him tremendously.<eos> And you Will live and die for him.<eos> You Will !
It's you.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I thought you'd sleep till noon.<eos> Sh. You're supposed to be relaxing.<eos> I'm very relaxed.<eos> Good.<eos> How are you feeling this morning?<eos> Miserable.<eos> I wish you could stay here longer.<eos> All right, I will.
Miserable.<eos> I wish you could stay here longer.<eos> All right, I will.<eos> I'll stay a few more days.<eos> - You can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because in two days you are going to be elected Kai.<eos> Oh, that!<eos> There's no guarantee I'll win.<eos> Of course you will.
Be still!<eos> Be still! BE STILL, YOU LITTLE CUNT!<eos> By Christ, I'll beat you brainless!<eos> Can't come outside, 'cause no gas-mask!<eos> And Bubby DIE!<eos> Now be still!<eos> Poison!<eos> Poison!<eos> If the poison don't get you?<eos> - Then God will.
I don't know...<eos> Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.<eos> Good-bye, Cat.<eos> There... She's happy with God now!<eos> It is the duty of all human beings to think God out of existence.<eos> Full of surprises, aren't we...<eos> Be still, Kat!<eos> I'll beat you brainless, by Christ!<eos> Poison don't get you...<eos> God will...!
It's hard to say<eos> You may not like this But yes, he's doing alright<eos> He gets a bit depressed but not for long.<eos> It's OK<eos> Ever mention me?<eos> Or rather, yes<eos> Sometimes.<eos> In his sleep<eos> So you didn't tell him?<eos> Will you?
Which one do we take?<eos> - I've never been here before.<eos> Whoa, ugly!<eos> You smelly... lump of lard!<eos> Impressive.<eos> How pathetic.<eos> Killed by the same man that killed his father.<eos> You killed my father?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> As I will you.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> I'm giving you five minutes to make up your mind.<eos> Okay.<eos> Eric, you can't do this.<eos> This is way too much.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> I like danger.<eos> Yes. I do.<eos> Made up your mind?<eos> No, and I won't.
I have to find him.<eos> - Who? - Superman.<eos> Lois.<eos> I'm so glad you could make it.<eos> I have everything all ready for you.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Yes. It was very difficult, replacing all the Malathion with my formula.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course you don't, dear.<eos> But soon you will.
I'll always be by your side and back you up.<eos> I'll take care of this photo.<eos> I'll take it back to you at last.<eos> I'll wait for such a day patiently.<eos> Promise me, no matter what happens.<eos> You mustn't believe what director Kiuhon says, don't listen to his sweet talks or fall into his traps.<eos> Handa, don't you believe I belong to you already?<eos> I will never forget our oaths.<eos> You must wait for my return.<eos> I surely will.
God forgive me, I do!<eos> I want to be what you are.<eos> See what you see. Love what you love.<eos> To walk with me, you must die from this life and be reborn to mine.<eos> You are my love and my life always.<eos> Then I give you life eternal.<eos> Everlasting love.<eos> The power of the storm and the beasts of the earth.<eos> Walk with me to be my loving wife forever.<eos> I will! Yes!
No, of course not.<eos> Enterprise to Ambassador Alkar.<eos> Respond, sir.<eos> I'm here, Captain.<eos> Ambassador.<eos> You must return to the Enterprise immediately.<eos> Troi is dying.<eos> We will transport you whether you come willingly or not.<eos> Security force fields are protecting us.<eos> They won't any longer.
Look for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence.<eos> Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.<eos> He was made one through years of systematic abuse.<eos> Billy hates his own identity, you see, and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.<eos> But his pathology is a thousand times more savage and more terrifying.<eos> It rubs the lotion on its skin. It does this whenever it's told.<eos> Mister, my family will pay cash.<eos> Whatever ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.<eos> It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.<eos> Yes, it will, Precious.
He was doing it fast, because he got a direct blast of whatever happened at the lab explosion.<eos> Williams was exposed to the same forces, but not as much. That's why he's going slower.<eos> Why he's still alive. Jude Andrews has figured this out. He's playing with us.<eos> Look...<eos> I'm stuck in DC until tomorrow. What a guy.<eos> Wearing pyjamas. - Can't this wait till I get back?<eos> - No. I've got to move now.<eos> I'm afraid that if I don't, Andrews will grab Williams for the Shop.<eos> Ackerman and Williams' wife will become unfortunate accidents.<eos> Then so will we.
But we have less than an hour.<eos> You're a wise and experienced leader.<eos> I assume you trust your senses.<eos> I would say so.<eos> And your senses tell you this woman is the most powerful force on Ventax?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then what would you say if I told you that she has no powers whatsoever?<eos> We have seen her powers here.<eos> That's right.<eos> And you will again.
Tyson turns into George Foreman, who eyes me like a basket of muffins.<eos> The bell rings.<eos> I try to fight, but I'm powerless.<eos> Then our eyes meet.<eos> He gives me the old one- two.<eos> The crowd is on its feet, cheering.<eos> I'm down.<eos> The count starts.<eos> The crowd's screaming, "Get up!" But I can't.<eos> I won't!
BARRY: Hmm?<eos> IRIS: Mm-hm.<eos> IRIS: Barry.<eos> BARRY: Hmm?<eos> IRIS: The Thai food.<eos> BARRY: The what?<eos> IRIS: The Thai food was ready 10 minutes ago.<eos> BARRY: I should go.<eos> I'll go.<eos> IRIS: You will?
We found him!<eos> We caught you, Reub.<eos> You've been playing us for saps, but you were wrong.<eos> Mr Weingartner!<eos> Art!<eos> Look!<eos> Look over there! Look!<eos> Right now!<eos> Go on. Go on.<eos> I'll...
Our queen heard your appeal and asked me to bring you this cheque, out of her private funds.<eos> Goodness, all this money!<eos> Saved, we are saved.<eos> We'll never manage it.<eos> - Yes, everyone will help. - Who is everyone?<eos> You can't put the lads up to their necks in this.<eos> It would be tempting the devil.<eos> You don't mean to say...<eos> That we're dishonest?<eos> No, of course, but other people will.
Yes.<eos> I was thoughtless.<eos> If you wish, sir.<eos> I am weak.<eos> Yes.<eos> I am a man! From Earth I'm the one who has taken you inside me.<eos> You're of two minds, sir. You haven't finished your work, and you hesitate whether or not you should go back.<eos> I know who you want to talk to, sir. My father. To have him out of your way, and the Szerns who oppose you.<eos> Do you feel disgraced? Spurned? I love you, sir.<eos> As nobody ever will. From beyond life! From beyond death and woe!
Hello.<eos> -Hello.<eos> My door closed on me and the key's on the inside.<eos> I stepped out to call Boris, because he forgot his briefcase... and the wind made my door slam.<eos> Could I use your phone?<eos> I need to call a locksmith. -No, that's not possible.<eos> Why?<eos> -Listen, I'm expecting someone.<eos> You won't leave me outside like this?<eos> -Yes, I will.
Get out there and start kissing up.<eos> [Kissing sounds]<eos> I'm not kissing up to anyone.<eos> Especially, not walter burke ! I knew you wouldn't.<eos> That's why i'm here to do it for you.<eos> Oh, wally !<eos> No , wait !<eos> You can't go out there.<eos> What if they discover you're an alien ?<eos> They won't !
I told him not to go on this meet alone.<eos> I also told him to call me by 5:00, and it's past midnight now.<eos> I know.<eos> Get me the police.<eos> They don't label a person missing till he's been gone for 24 hours.<eos> Well, I can still call them, can't I?<eos> I mean, that is what they're for, isn't it?<eos> Look, I'm sorry, Helen. It's getting a Iittle late.<eos> Why don't you just go on home.<eos> I will if you will.
It's that Fitzgerald boy.<eos> I can't. Not right now.<eos> She's not here.<eos> Yes. I'll tell her.<eos> Good Lord, Zelda, if you're not going to talk to this boy, release him from your spell.<eos> Spare us from all the constant ringing.<eos> I can't help it if I'm never home.<eos> He's going to give up.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> I sure as heck would.
You know, I tried for months.<eos> He just pushed me away. Didn't want me here.<eos> You can only help someone who actually wants to be helped.<eos> I was wondering if you wanted me to... (WILL CRASHING)<eos> Right, well, you better not move until I've cleaned that up because I've got no idea what I'd do if you pop a tire.<eos> It was awful!<eos> It's his girlfriend and his best friend.<eos> You can't blame her.<eos> Are you really saying that you'd stick around with me if I was paralyzed from the neck down?<eos> Of course I would.
And you make pretty good calzone.<eos> Was that three?<eos> That was like one and then 1A.<eos> You know what? Um... Let's try some role playing.<eos> All right, Amy, I want you to pretend to be Mike, and Mike, I want you to pretend to be Amy.<eos> And now I just want you to just tell me about your day.<eos> Hi, I'm Amy.<eos> All I did today was, like, rub lotion on my face and talk, talk, talk, talk.<eos> Amy, would you like to...<eos> Yes, I would!
Is this your house?<eos> I've been here for hours.<eos> I wanted to confirm that this wasn't a waste of my time.<eos> Well, what about my time?<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> My time is much more valuable than yours.<eos> Speaking of, I've only allotted 28 minutes for this conversation, which is very generous of me.<eos> So we should begin.<eos> I'd like to leave.<eos> Oh, no, you wouldn't.
That was before.<eos> Now he thinks they're after him.<eos> Who's "they"?<eos> Oh, his partners, whoever he competes with in this sex business of his that I'm not supposed to know anything about, whoever tried to kill him.<eos> He forgets that sometimes people are around when he's talking on the phone.<eos> He would never tell me.<eos> You've got to stall.<eos> You have to stall.<eos> I can't.<eos> How would I?
My father was gone.<eos> She was alone.<eos> But... she put me behind her, and she faced these men.<eos> They knew they could kill her.<eos> But they also looked her in the eyes and knew she would take at least one of them with her.<eos> And they left.<eos> Because none of them wanted to be that one.<eos> Who can say if it is we who make the choice, or the choice that makes us?<eos> ...the ceremony.<eos> The last thing we would...
Okay.<eos> Uh, but you never reported this in your first interview.<eos> I wanted to protect Nate.<eos> Protect him?<eos> When Nate and I arrived at the house, Sam was in the driveway getting into his car, about to leave town.<eos> Sam?<eos> Sam was drunk, yelling at me.<eos> Nate got out of his car to try to calm him down.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam wouldn't.
"550 square feet, furnished, full bath,<eos> "high floors, quiet building, security assured.<eos> "Close proximity to the Lexington Avenue local.<eos> Continental breakfast upon request."<eos> Paradise or what?<eos> That sounds perfect.<eos> That's because it is.<eos> The only thing that could possibly make it better is if you lived next to me.<eos> Oops!<eos> You would.
He wanted to know why you didn't have hair.<eos> He's a good kid.<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> He's handsome, like his dad.<eos> Well, I hope he gets your modesty, too.<eos> He's got your eyes.<eos> And your smile.<eos> He's gonna break a lot of hearts.<eos> - I'll be back.<eos> - You'd better.
Sell orders have all been entered.<eos> It's time.<eos> We will activate our asset immediately.<eos> And this must be Aleksandr.<eos> The prodigal returns.<eos> He may not be a regular churchgoer, but he's a good man, my son.<eos> He just turned 21.<eos> And he already has a job at the auto plant.<eos> It was stupid to mention the job.<eos> A real mother would.
- So, what did you do...<eos> - ...to cause her death that day?<eos> - I can't tell you.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because I don't remember!<eos> She was very happy that day.<eos> She asked me to say "I love you."<eos> I didn't.<eos> She wanted me to marry her.<eos> I wouldn't.
It was.<eos> Where did it go?<eos> Mommy gerbil ate it.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Did you touch it?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't touch the babies.<eos> It makes the mommy eat them.<eos> But why would she...?
No answer.<eos> Okay. Maybe not.<eos> Maybe we can visit my family tomorrow?<eos> No, no. I cannot drink another bottle tomorrow.<eos> Do you know anything about Germany?<eos> I know Hitler. Oktoberfest.<eos> Sauerkraut. And Heidi Klum.<eos> Would you like to know more about it?<eos> Can I?<eos> Would you?
After Nadine was born, I put on weight, I was tired...<eos> He stopped touching me.<eos> Men, honestly...<eos> Except when he drank...<eos> I never saw her eyes but I know she was pretty.<eos> Think about her a lot?<eos> When she left my womb, she was blue. Her heart had stopped.<eos> Jo yelled, drank, then said life was sick.<eos> You think it's my fault, huh?<eos> Because I'd drunk?
Both white, male, one with a sleeve tattoo, dark hair, beard, pale blue T-shirt, khaki body-warmer, the other ginger hair, beard, pasty-faced, pink hoodie.<eos> We're going to have to take it out of the business. We're going to have to borrow a bit from here, there and everywhere, that's how we can do it.<eos> You're not to tell anyone, they get a whiff anyone else knows, they say they're going to start doing stuff to her.<eos> I won't. I won't. And they must be watching me, they know things.<eos> For months! Following me. Following Ann!<eos> -Jesus! -We can... I can look into how much you can take out of the business if that's...<eos> I've got maybe 200 grand I can lay my hands on immediately, but even then, are they going to let me withdraw that amount in cash, without asking bloody questions?<eos> Well, it's your money.<eos> Yeah, but they're going to think I'm laundering money, then they're going to tell the police!<eos> -Really? -Well, I would!
Is it you that's...<eos> Your grandson, is it him that's our Tommy's lad?<eos> Who's told you that? -Is he called Ryan?<eos> -Who's told you that?<eos> Somebody mentioned it down in Hebden the other day.<eos> -Friend of a friend. -Who?<eos> -I don't know. Somebody. I don't know, I can't remember.<eos> Well, who were you with?<eos> -Well, you wouldn't know 'em. -Try me.<eos> Well, you would. The usual smackheads.
-I'm sorry?<eos> -Like that nonsense with Marcus Gascoigne. Shall we have this conversation in my office, Sergeant?<eos> Have they checked if any of the hospitals have reported any gunshot or stab wounds?<eos> -Catherine, Get into my office.<eos> -Have they? -What about Roger Elgood? -Who?<eos> Roger Elgood.<eos> He was a GP, lives on Ripponden.<eos> Got struck off months since for signing blank prescriptions.<eos> Don't you know what goes on on your patch? Why would Tommy Lee Royce know to go to Roger Elgood?<eos> -Why wouldn't he? -Catherine.
- No, we're done here.<eos> Thanks, Dr. Shepherd.<eos> Richard.<eos> What are you doing tomorrow night?<eos> Hey, this could be you if you keep eating like you do.<eos> I bet if we took your blood right now...<eos> Mm-hmm, see, I could say the same thing about you, but I wouldn't want to change a single thing about you, so I won't.<eos> I don't want to change anything about you either.<eos> I like you alive, not dead on a toilet after having a heart attack trying to pass a deep-fried onion blossom.<eos> - God, Miranda, why would you even...
- Really.<eos> Uh... - Excuse me.<eos> - I just want to get my stuff.<eos> ...let me get my stuff!<eos> First morning in the house.<eos> That's going in the album!<eos> We got a letter! - A letter?<eos> We never get mail.<eos> - Sorry. It's stuck.<eos> - Would you...
- You know, I owe you for this.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> Maybe I could cook for you sometime. You know?<eos> Bring us some lunch. Save you eating those cardboard sandwiches.<eos> Matt...<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I am trying to keep it professional.<eos> You'd get bored with me.<eos> - Oh, I doubt that.<eos> - Well, yes, you would.
Jacs is threatening Debbie.<eos> Can't you do something about that?<eos> Normal rules don't apply to Jacs.<eos> Yeah. Your daughter's fucked.<eos> You'd get bored with me.<eos> - Oh, I doubt that.<eos> - Well, yes, you would.
You speak your heart.<eos> I know your concern for the boy.<eos> He no longer stands as such.<eos> But in the eyes of his father.<eos> Would my wife could voice such simple wisdom.<eos> I saw the gathering of trunks.<eos> She goes with you?<eos> It was her intent.<eos> Yet I would find no comfort in her presence.<eos> As I would in yours...
They're gone!<eos> Something's not right.<eos> Regina would never leave evidence like this behind.<eos> Maybe she already used them to portal out of Storybrooke.<eos> Without Henry?<eos> I don't think so. What if something bad happened to her?<eos> Security system says the last time someone was in the office was around 6:00 this morning.<eos> They used an override code to get in.<eos> Why would Regina need an override code on her own alarm?<eos> She wouldn't.
Thank you, sir.<eos> Captain, would you like to discuss what the lieutenant and I discovered?<eos> Is it over?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's all I need to hear.<eos> It's late.<eos> Go home.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> Listen.<eos> Not really good at this kind of thing, but I would...
Packed lunch?<eos> Is there anything in there besides your soccer ball?<eos> I miss my dad.<eos> I don't even know if he's alive.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> I want to grow up before I die.<eos> So did my brother.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't ask for this.<eos> Who would?
Don't spoil it.<eos> So what have I done that's so bloody stimulating?<eos> Yeah?<eos> What if it's not a word, what if it is individual letters?<eos> You think it's an acronym?<eos> Absolutely no idea, but...<eos> - What the hell are you doing here?<eos> ! - Nice to see you too<eos> I'm on holiday, would you believe?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
And I couldn't wait three days for my resurrection.<eos> I love Satan.<eos> [Gasps]<eos> I love Satan! I love... - Seitan.<eos> - Oh. - It's like tofu.<eos> - Mmm.<eos> It's like food, but not. Mm-hmm.<eos> Would you like another glass of wine? Mm.<eos> [Snaps fingers] - Whoo!<eos> - Yes... I would.
This is Best's contrivance.<eos> Look at her!<eos> Her eyes, the stars on her face, her guts.<eos> Her abdomen was opened fresh, right here, as part of the autopsy conducted by Homer Jackson.<eos> That Yankee clap-doctor! The man was a US Army surgeon and he was a Pinkerton.<eos> Pinkerton? That's right.<eos> A chartered mercenary with a badge!<eos> And you place his word above mine.<eos> I think you would have her Ripper above all else.<eos> Another bite, another chance at him. But you would not?
With a bible. She served as a stool.<eos> When They Saw this, I have Theytaken to give me a copy of one pocket Which I Could sit down.<eos> You know why I've Spent My Life in prison?<eos> When I was 13, I was to the movies with a guy and he Said, one shit about my mother.<eos> You know the type.<eos> With my penknife I cut his throat.<eos> I Would have killed him If I had let him.<eos> The judge said: " Henry" you knew what You Were doing? "<eos> " Yes, Your Honor. I wanted to kill That son of a bitch! "<eos> And I would.
Um...<eos> Fred has been studying ventriloquism.<eos> Yeah! I might do it professionally.<eos> Woohoo!<eos> (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) You're being ridiculous.<eos> Stop it! Sit down! You should be nicer to your son.<eos> It's just a thought.<eos> Who wants to hear a song?<eos> We'd love to sing a song for you.<eos> - No, we wouldn't.
You don't go on the drink. Don't gamble, you join in with the kids, you don't knock us about. Lucky me.<eos> For Christ's sake, Eddie, that's as it should be!<eos> You try and understand that.<eos> Rights, it's not privileges.<eos> It's that easy. It really bloody is.<eos> Didn't think you were coming.<eos> Very good, gentlemen.<eos> Can I call on Monty Taylor, Senior Convener, Ford Dagenham?<eos> Thank you, I shall try to be brief.<eos> If you would.
I believe there's an answer which would secure your future and give you a position.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> Just think about it.<eos> I don't have to think about it.<eos> Marry a man who can barely hold his knife like a gentleman?<eos> Oh, you exaggerate.<eos> You're American, you don't understand these things.<eos> Have you mentioned this to Granny?<eos> Did she laugh?<eos> Why would she?
- Hey, where you been?<eos> - I was talking with Penny.<eos> What's wrong with you? You can't hang out with your roommate's ex.<eos> That's totally uncool.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'm over it.<eos> That's why he's been whining about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black. Is he making any progress?<eos> Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.<eos> So would Ben Affleck.
Nope.<eos> Munch.<eos> Van Gogh?<eos> No. Cezanne. Wow.<eos> You really do suck at this.<eos> So you wouldn't buy it. Absolutely not.<eos> I mean, I don't know if I would.<eos> I mean, it depends.<eos> I guess it depends kind of the price. I mean, yeah, no--<eos> I definitely would, I definitely, I would.
No, these?<eos> These are allergies.<eos> And what are you allergic to, Mom?<eos> Senior year.<eos> Bouillabaisse.<eos> What?<eos> For our annual back-to-school dinner.<eos> I've been going back and forth, trying to figure out what to make, but if I do bouillabaisse, I can put a little bit of everything in.<eos> Mom, we don't have to do a whole...<eos> No, why wouldn't we?
And shut down.<eos> (Laurie makes whirring sound)<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> You get to stay at your place tonight.<eos> Enjoy it.<eos> And reboot.<eos> My mom's dating the Terminator.<eos> You know why I'd rather play fetch with you than my dog?<eos> It's 'cause you would never bring the ball back To your tiny, little dog girlfriend.<eos> You'd ing it to me.
I got it. Hi.<eos> Not now.<eos> What do you mean, "not now"?<eos> I called you, I texted you. I tracked you down.<eos> Jan in reception said There was a helicopter here, which I can't believe I missed.<eos> But I just need a moment of your time.<eos> I think we should have dinner tomorrow night-- uh, no. Sheldon.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Cooper--can you just tell him what's going on?<eos> I'd rather not, frankly.
- I don't know.<eos> - I couldn't.<eos> - That's not an answer.<eos> Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?<eos> Because I want to remember what you say right now.<eos> For the love of... I was a coward.<eos> I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.<eos> You said "wouldn't".<eos> Whatever!<eos> I wouldn't!
Back to you, Norm.<eos> What?<eos> That was my first job.<eos> It shows where I came from.<eos> Unless a bear attacks you in the next three seconds and you snap its neck with your legs, that has no business being on your reel.<eos> No, no, I get it, I get it.<eos> Where you're from is part of who you're selling.<eos> For instance, under "special skills" on my résumé, I mention that back in Minnesota, I was the 1995 Nicollet County Slam Dunk Champion.<eos> You put dunk champion on your résumé?<eos> Yeah, why wouldn't you?
She turned out to be not who I thought she was. At least, not anymore.<eos> I'm sorry too, son.<eos> Dad, you were right about this.<eos> But I think you need to give me space to make my own mistakes.<eos> Well lucky for you, you'll be at Yale soon.<eos> You can make all the mistakes you want with, God willing girls your own age.<eos> B, I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> I know it was Rachel that sent the Gossip Girl blast.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't believe you.<eos> Why would you?
- He doesn't like cops.<eos> - And what are you, a fed?<eos> - I'll take that as a yes.<eos> - Lieutenant Platko...<eos> You may not know Jimmy, but your daughter does.<eos> I don't have a daughter.<eos> That's not what Lucy says.<eos> You went to see Lucy?<eos> I wanted her to help me find Jimmy.<eos> She wouldn't.
What's going on with Sayid?<eos> Don't know anything yet.<eos> What do you mean, you don't know anything?<eos> I thought you were at Sawyer's last night.<eos> What did he tell you?<eos> He told me to leave him alone and let him do his job.<eos> And you're going to?<eos> I'll talk to Juliet, see what she can tell me.<eos> Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you anything, why would Juliet?<eos> - Well, why wouldn't she?
One that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these.<eos> And what charges might those be, Will?<eos> I haven't said anything yet.<eos> Do you think you're the first firm she's shopping this lawsuit to?<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> Even the state's attorney... the new state's attorney... thinks there's nothing there.<eos> And yet I got you to a settlement lunch on a half hour's notice.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage?<eos> You want to know what I would say?<eos> I would.
But turns out he don't have any anymore.<eos> He forgot he gave a whole bunch to that fbi rat bastard.<eos> So he went to go see Donatelli's wee bitch to get it back.<eos> Something for something.<eos> Mr. Punisher, sir.<eos> So when did Donatelli go undercover?<eos> We were partners in narcotics.<eos> Unfortunately, most of the blow we confiscated ended up in my nose.<eos> Internal Affairs tried to get Nicky to rat me out.<eos> He wouldn't.
Get back!<eos> - My toe!<eos> - I'm not on your toe! - Move back.<eos> - Will you stop shoving?<eos> lmpossible.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm sure it's just your imagination.<eos> I don't suppose saying we're sorry<eos> - would quite cover it.<eos> - No. It wouldn't.
I know you're not a drinking man, so I hope water is okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, let's get down to business. Let's talk turkey.<eos> My investigators have turned up a lot of dirt.<eos> It could be really embarrassing if this stuff got out.<eos> I'd like to save you from that embarrassment.<eos> That's very kind of you, Owen.<eos> My committee has the power to hold public hearings.<eos> I'd like to spare you that.<eos> Would you now?
They lose a bomb like we lose our keys.<eos> They want to get it back, but they won't pay.<eos> Look, when it comes to blackmail, they're very peculiar.<eos> Hey super cop, what're you, defending them?<eos> No, but there are values, real values.<eos> The ones I thought you defended too.<eos> How much time we got?<eos> 37 minutes.<eos> It wouldn't hurt to have an idea.<eos> Yeah, it wouldn't, huh?
Phone.<eos> - Phone.<eos> - Oh, phone.<eos> You're good.<eos> Hello?<eos> Darryl, now is not really a good time again.<eos> Let me call you back?<eos> All right.<eos> Not that I'm okay with you stealing my stuff, but those earrings really do look amazing on you.<eos> Then again, what wouldn't?
- What about references to an orb?<eos> - I took the liberty of checking.<eos> Historical inventories of the Luna Temple do not list any orb.<eos> Then I want you both to list every orb ever mentioned in Greek history.<eos> Every one?<eos> liable to be thousands.<eos> Then we'll read thousands.<eos> Start with that one.<eos> Perhaps you together would like to have some tea while you wait?<eos> No, they wouldn't.
I didn't know it'd be, you know...<eos> Older people?<eos> - That's okay.<eos> - Older than me, say.<eos> Are you a little shy, Oscar?<eos> I think you are.<eos> I think you're very nice, too.<eos> Would you like to come home with me?<eos> I know, I can't believe I said it, either.<eos> But would you?
In a sewer. Or a manhole.<eos> - A river is the best way.<eos> - Would you throw her in a river?<eos> You see, in the movies they get the body and check the DNA... I think in Brazil that won't happen!<eos> Imitating "Shallow Grave"... I would cut the hands and feet...<eos> It 's so complicated, cutting a body.<eos> No, no cutting. Just burning.<eos> Set fire on her, throw acid to burn it all.<eos> L'd burn her.<eos> L really would.
Who?<eos> Your boss.<eos> You claim to know her?<eos> No... but we have heard that... she's trying to improve conditions on this planet for females.<eos> It's a worthy cause.<eos> Causes need currency.<eos> So we'd like to discuss... a business deal.<eos> Not interested.<eos> We'd prefer to hear that from Selva.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Remember Mason Verger?<eos> Lecter's fοurth victim. The rich one.<eos> The only one that survived.<eos> He says he has some new information on Lecter. He'll only share it with you.<eos> Only me?<eos> You want it seize it.<eos> -We'd rather not.<eos> I wasn't speaking to you, Krendler.<eos> When I speak to you, I'll look at you.<eos> Why would we rather not?
- When what?<eos> - When it reminds me just...<eos> When it reminds you how beautiful the world can be?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And there's some fat guy staring at us.<eos> I don't think telling any woman to forcibly insert an object up her anus is something that should go without consequence.<eos> I think we should buy him a moped.<eos> I think we should get a divorce.<eos> - You won't tell Mum, will you?<eos> - Why would I?
The book is a tract about, you know what are the dangers of married life? What are the silent desperations of keeping an ongoing relationship alive and what are the choices?<eos> You're either in that or you're not.<eos> And Stanley was very, very much a family man and in it.<eos> The conjectures that he made about what it might be like outside it had a lot to do with his curiosity.<eos> It was a theme that we both talked about a great deal.<eos> He thought about it in many different ways.<eos> It used to come back over the years again and again and as you see friends getting divorced and remarried the topic would come up again.<eos> It had so many variations and so much really serious thought to it that he knew one day he was going to make it.<eos> May I ask why a beautiful woman who could have any man in this room, wants to be married?<eos> Why wouldn't she?
I hope they don't, but our place is gonna be full of charm.<eos> You don't care what happens here?<eos> Of course I do. But it's not up to me.<eos> I can't control that.<eos> The only thing we can control is what our inn's gonna be like. - I guess.<eos> - You guess what?<eos> - We'll see. - We'll see what?<eos> It's shortsighted to write off this place when we haven't even bought Fran's yet.<eos> - And we don't know if we will. - We don't?<eos> Why wouldn't we?
Still, it was kind.<eos> This would be easier if you would remain stationary.<eos> It doesn't feel right.<eos> You may experience unusual sensations while your matrix realigns. I was referring to the "arrangement"<eos> the Captain's made with the Nygeans.<eos> No matter how terrible the crimes these men committed, it seems wrong to hand them over to be executed.<eos> This is a Federation starship, not the Barge of the Dead. Would you have preferred the Captain release them?<eos> Of course not. They're dangerous men.<eos> Executing them ensures they'll never pose a threat to anyone again.<eos> So would life sentences...
The Chad was great.<eos> I'll tap the signal from the roof.<eos> -I'lI deal with Knox.-I'lI bring our Bosley back.<eos> "I don't know how to make chicken." Jerk.<eos> Dylan.<eos> Thank God you're alive.<eos> You know my better half.<eos> It figures I'd meet the perfect guy and he'd already have a perfect girl.<eos> Hello,blondie. Her girlfriend's here.<eos> Jimmy,Paulie,go secure BosIey,would you?
-What just happened in there?<eos> -This better be good.<eos> -I wasn't ready for them to know.<eos> -You weren't ready?<eos> Being ready's not it.<eos> You have results, you report them.<eos> -Can I explain?<eos> -You just lied to the Pentagon!<eos> Once they know we've completed it what's to stop them from taking over the project?<eos> -Why would they?
One which the senior partners hoped... [FOOTSTEPS]<eos> Ladies.<eos> - I believe you said something about a massacre.<eos> - Your wife kindly invited us in.<eos> - Ah.<eos> DRUSILLA: Very sweet, she was.<eos> Like clover.<eos> And honey.<eos> Think of it as our way of giving you what you want.<eos> - What would I...?
But it went broke.<eos> What a shame.<eos> I have some friends in the art game.<eos> Perhaps I can be of some help.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Someone you know?<eos> My... husband.<eos> Don't you think one of the charms of marriage... is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties?<eos> May I ask why a beautiful woman... who could have any man in this room, wants to be married?<eos> Why wouldn't she?
Doug... I should've told you, but I didn't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can we please move on? Yeah, she's a girl, and you were afraid to tell me because you think she's hot.<eos> I don't think she's hot.<eos> Doug, please. I know you very well. It's like you have a window on your forehead, and I can read your thoughts.<eos> Right now, the 2 big ones are "entenmann's" and "she's hot."<eos> I mean, here's this cute trainee driving around in the truck all day with me, and I wouldn't blame you if you felt a little weird about that.<eos> I don't.<eos> Oh, come on, it's not a little weird for you? No! Doug, I mean, I know you wouldn't fool around on me.<eos> Of course I wouldn't, but her.
Why?<eos> I'll probably get life.<eos> I should smoke two at once.<eos> It'll shorten the sentence.<eos> I really don't want to lose my children.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't want you to either.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> When Michael died, you asked the aunts to bring him back.<eos> But they wouldn't.
They probably realised experimenting with it was causing too many problems.<eos> Exactly.<eos> If we can't track the Touchstone, we may be able to track the second gate on Earth.<eos> Oh, sure!<eos> Let's just put out an APB for a huge, honkin', two-storey metal ring with 39 little pictures all nicely engraved on it!<eos> Actually, I had another thought.<eos> Go ahead, Captain.<eos> We use our gate to go to Madrona, then do a 180 and return through the second gate here on Earth.<eos> If one input the Earth's coordinates on the Madrona dialling device, he would be sent back to the gate on this facility.<eos> You would.
Sydney got ready to be scandalized.<eos> It could not bear to see the two of them together.<eos> Let her socialize with the notorious Charley Fig, if she wished.<eos> Or with her accountant, Jimmy D'Abbs.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Harvey Briggs has bought himself a steamer.<eos> - He can take us up to Pittwater.<eos> - Or across to Mossman's Bay.<eos> - Who'd trust Briggsy with a steamer?<eos> - I'd rather Pittwater.
- One of us, Randall... ..he lost control.<eos> We tried to exorcise the demon from Randall... ..but it killed him.<eos> We killed him.<eos> We thought we were free of the demon after that.<eos> But now he's back.<eos> - And, one by one, he will kill us all.<eos> - Three down, two to go.<eos> Then it's going after Ethan.<eos> I better beat it there.<eos> - We'd better.
Is Charles fully prepared, or will it be a question of luck?<eos> It is going to be absolutely fine - He was always lucky as hell.<eos> - So he is well acquainted<eos> - Emily?<eos> - What is it, Minnie?<eos> - It's two o'clock, dear.<eos> It is time...<eos> - Oh, give them to me, then.<eos> Would you care to see the boat, Mr. Poirot?<eos> - Oh, I certainly would!
Well, I guess we won't be double-dating any time soon.<eos> Well, to tell you the truth, Chief I think our double-dating days are...<eos> Miss Lane!<eos> Mr. Gendell.<eos> I just came by to thank you for reintroducing me to the world.<eos> And I was wondering if you and your husband would join Connie and me for dinner?<eos> - Thanks, but we're not going to do any...<eos> - We'd love to.<eos> We would?<eos> Well, of course you would.
He's a big lad, he can take care of himself!<eos> I'm glad you're on our side.<eos> There's still some snap in these old vines.<eos> I better get back before they send the whole camp after me.<eos> - When will I see you again?<eos> - Meet me tonight, right here.<eos> Well! I haven't had this much excitement in 200 years.<eos> What am I doing? I shouldn't be seeing him again.<eos> I mean, I want to see him again.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Either way, I can't do a thing.<eos> This planet is about to blow up.<eos> What can I do?<eos> Arrest it?<eos> I never should've let her go.<eos> I shouldn't have waited to call.<eos> Then why did you?<eos> I was afraid.<eos> Afraid she'd hang up on me.<eos> Afraid she wouldn't.
(Bridger) I understand that, Mr. Gaye, but we have a situation.<eos> Our prototype's been stolen. Well, I sympathize.<eos> But I can't violate the secrecy of the competition.<eos> Well, it's no secret that Hydrogear's in it. Yes, it is.<eos> That Hydrogear let leak their participation... doesn't change the confidential nature of the competition.<eos> Put me through to Sec. Gen. Noyce.<eos> We'll be at the qualifying trials.<eos> You can speak to him then. No, no, no.<eos> I want to speak to him right now.<eos> So would 25,000 other people.
He looks away whenever we make eye contact.<eos> Who?<eos> The new arrival that the Klingons brought back from the Gamma Quadrant.<eos> - Croden?<eos> He's harmless.<eos> - Really?<eos> How is it you've come to know him so well?<eos> A man comes in for a drink, he wants to talk.<eos> He didn't want to talk to Sisko when he arrived.<eos> Who would?
I just-- You know what that's like.<eos> No, I don't. Would you please get out?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Is this car 564?<eos> No.<eos> Well, there you are. See? I've done it again.<eos> I'm supposed to be in car 564. Maybe you should go to car 564.<eos> Would you know where that is?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Yes, we did. We ordered that.<eos> - What now?<eos> - The governor's mediators are here.<eos> How many mediators do they think we need?<eos> Shit!<eos> You have no idea... how much I understand what you're going through.<eos> Look at her, man.<eos> - She look like the missing link.<eos> - I think she's kind of cute.<eos> - Yeah, you would.
Hurry up to the bridge with that.<eos> The Captain wants you to scan the orders and be ready to brief him in ten minutes. Right?<eos> - Number One.<eos> - Riker here.<eos> Meet Cmdr Data on the bridge.<eos> He has our new orders.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> And assemble the bridge staff for a briefing in 1 5 minutes.<eos> Picard out.<eos> - Mr Elbrun, would you...
Come in.<eos> It took all day, but I found out Zach Sullivan and his mother... - Aren't related to Crisp. - I just found out.<eos> I got a bottle of wine for your big date...<eos> It's not a date, I know. But Joyce shouldn't think that.<eos> Thanks. I don't think it's a good idea.<eos> Why not?<eos> Quickest way to slip up doing undercover work is doing things you normally wouldn't do.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You mean you wouldn't take wine to a woman who's invited you for dinner?<eos> Of course you would.
- Ah!<eos> M y Queen!<eos> Freer through her blood my power rises up anew.<eos> The day which is the wretch's last, will be the first of peace.<eos> Barbarous woman, have you signed the death of a sister?<eos> And you must stand witness at her last moment;<eos> Your beloved shall die after the fateful moment when the warlike metal fires three shots.<eos> And you would have me watch?<eos> B e silent, silent.<eos> - You would?
Sure.<eos> There 's no hurry.<eos> I said in 6' months...<eos> The rest is coming.<eos> He still inspires you?<eos> Not only that<eos> - You're gonna hear something fantastic...<eos> I'd like to have Berangere, a bit.<eos> I'm organized now, so if she wants....<eos> Sure she would.
No, I'm sorry, we don't have a thing available until after 7.15.<eos> Yeah, that's OK.<eos> - Goodnight, Rose.<eos> - The young woman said you'd get this.<eos> - She didn't pay for this?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> Lulu?<eos> She said the gentleman would pay for dinner.<eos> You...<eos> The gentleman would...
I was good at acrobatics.<eos> Pay was good. Seemed like fun, so...<eos> I wanted to run away with the circus when I was a kid.<eos> - You did?<eos> Me, too.<eos> - Really?<eos> Mm...<eos> Maybe not run away. Maybe visit for a while.<eos> - Read to us, Malcolm.<eos> - Maybe your parents wouldn't...
I didn't understand what my tonsils had to do with my eyes either.<eos> But anyway that night at least I think it was night I reached up to untie the blindfold and I saw...<eos> Hello again.<eos> - Sorry about this.<eos> I was detained.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> - So how are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> Well, I made it.<eos> You wouldn't...
Well...<eos> I can't believe this... shit!<eos> Japanese crap!<eos> - I hope we're not disturbing.<eos> - Welcome to Florida Arklab.<eos> - Quite a mess you have here.<eos> - Don't say!<eos> What's with Marek?<eos> - Why does that interest you?<eos> - Why wouldn't it?
Did you ever see a more brilliant diamond than the one my father has upon his finger?<eos> You must see it near.<eos> It is a beautiful one.<eos> It is very beautiful and it possesses great lustre.<eos> No, Madam, it is in hands too beautiful.<eos> It is a present my father gives you.<eos> I?<eos> Is it not true, father, that you wish her to keep it for your sake?<eos> What? He is making me signs that I am to force you to accept it.<eos> I would not...
Understand that I can not leave in this condition.<eos> As soon as you finish, I'd call a taxi.<eos> ¿Doctor Wells?<eos> Speaks Donald Kohler.<eos> It's my mother back.<eos> It is worse than above.<eos> You can not get out of bed.<eos> Can you come?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would?
Never heard it before.<eos> It's Scandinavian.<eos> It means electrical current.<eos> Like lightning striking.<eos> Like you!<eos> Sounds like a storm.<eos> Barnstormers.<eos> I suppose you young ones know that barnstormers were early play actors, went around on horseback playing in barns and such?<eos> - I didn't know that, Grandpa.<eos> - Well, Zeb would.
Gossip.<eos> Just gossip.<eos> - Don't you believe me?<eos> - No.<eos> Look under the pillow at your left-hand side.<eos> You see, my friendly chauffeur and the other gun... were just decoys.<eos> And that is the gun I was supposed to kill you with.<eos> I'm even taking off my bracelet because I don't want you to get scratched.<eos> - Now do you believe me?<eos> - I'd better.
I can assure you of that, Hogan.<eos> You know best, Commandant.<eos> ( phone rings )<eos> Oh, telephone. Oh, Frau Hilda will get it.<eos> Dismissed. I better wait. It may be for me.<eos> Hogan!<eos> General Fenstermacher's on the phone, Colonel Klink.<eos> General Fenstermacher? The head of the General Staff?<eos> Jawohl, Herr Kommandant.<eos> But why would he...?
Oh, I can feel the ice forming on my wings.<eos> I don't even have a plane.<eos> How can I get out of it, Hogan?<eos> How? Well, if you recapture the prisoners,<eos> Burkhalter might cancel your orders and reinstate you.<eos> What?<eos> Help them? Of course.<eos> You know how the prisoners think.<eos> You'd know where to look for them.<eos> I would?
I disagree, sir.<eos> I've used a Beretta for 10 years.<eos> I've never missed with it yet.<eos> No, but it jammed on your last job.<eos> You spent six months in hospital.<eos> You carry a double-0 number. It gives you a license to kill, not get killed.<eos> Since I've been head of Ml6, there's been a 40 percent drop in casualties.<eos> I want it to stay that way.<eos> You'll carry the Walther unless you prefer to go back to standard intelligence duties.<eos> No, sir, I would not.
- It's so quiet here...<eos> Lying on the hay like this...<eos> With the scent around me...<eos> I become drowsy.<eos> Mother...<eos> Once I really fell asleep on his arm.<eos> Bad manners.<eos> But... Really... It smells nice.<eos> They were shoving his head in the pond to make him talk.<eos> But he wouldn't.
Half-virgins get on my nerves.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> I can say nothing else. It's Mic, my best friend.<eos> I think the bathroom's busy, too.<eos> It can be quite complicated to be the host.<eos> Always the same hiding place.<eos> Come in.<eos> This is your parents' bedroom?<eos> - Does that intimidate you?<eos> - Why would it?
Thank you for being so kind.<eos> No trouble at all.<eos> I was going to spend the night in Dijon anyway.<eos> I won't hear of it.<eos> You'll dine with us... and stay overnight.<eos> - But -<eos> - No buts about it.<eos> I insist.<eos> - I wouldn't want to -<eos> - Well, I would.
- I wish I could believe that.<eos> - You've got to believe that.<eos> - Don't you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Give me time, Clarice.<eos> I'll learn.<eos> - Oh! I'll be late for my show!<eos> - Oh, look, can I see you again?<eos> - If you like.<eos> - I would.
- Alas.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Right on the nose.<eos> - Linus!<eos> Sorry, David.<eos> If Sabrina were only here.<eos> Hey, how about smuggling her up here?<eos> What if Father sees her?<eos> Yeah, we wouldn't want to spoil it.<eos> - No, we sure wouldn't.
Shoot!<eos> Boom.<eos> You're dead.<eos> That's the doorbell.<eos> Maybe they'll go away.<eos> They never do at a time like this.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> It's so good to hear you laugh again.<eos> I know.<eos> I'd better.
From here on, cut out the dogfights up there and stick to your acts.<eos> Brad, don't be a killjoy.<eos> You don't know what it's like up there.<eos> It's a different world.<eos> Just the two of us fighting for the crowd.<eos> You feel like you could do anything.<eos> Were not people up there.<eos> Were like two streaks of light with wings and...<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> - Nobody would, except another flyer.
Colonel.<eos> -Why do you persist in embarrassing me?<eos> -Did I embarrass you?<eos> -You know you did.<eos> -I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you for a charming evening, darling.<eos> I'm glad you enjoyed it.<eos> I think I'd like some coffee.<eos> Would you like some coffee?<eos> Yes, I would.
We must be very happy and expect nothing from him ever.<eos> No.<eos> I will try to be the best wife in the world.<eos> - I know you will.<eos> - I will get ready immediately.<eos> Catherine, dear.<eos> He can't dislike you that much.<eos> He's bound to come round.<eos> No, Morris, he will not.<eos> But even if he would, I would not.
- Well?<eos> - Well, he wants to register.<eos> - Well, whom does he want to register?<eos> It's probably some silly college boy sent here on an initiation stunt.<eos> Oh, he isn't a boy.<eos> He's a man, with red hair, and he's very determined.<eos> Why should a man wish to become a student here?<eos> He says he has a thirst for knowledge. And he wants to quench it in our swimming pool.<eos> Caroline, will you take care of this matter while we continue with the meeting?<eos> But Dean Clinton, wouldn't you rather...
Go to our Founder's grave, Sister.<eos> He'll tell you to seek our peace.<eos> - I went. He urged me to do this. - Sister!<eos> - Forgive me, Mother.<eos> - Go.<eos> She's the opposite of what we need.<eos> An agitated soul...<eos> But a soul, nonetheless.<eos> - We like your daughter, ma'am.<eos> - Who wouldn't?
