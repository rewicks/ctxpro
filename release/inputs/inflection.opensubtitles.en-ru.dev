- What about dinner?<eos> - I'll buy a shawarma.<eos> Shit!<eos> You called Vibeke.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> Aren't you asleep yet?<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - Out with Esben.<eos> - Until now?
- Yes, we've been busy.<eos> - Hi, Esben.<eos> - Hello, Kjeld.<eos> - Something smells delicious.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> He's been cooking all day.<eos> He's such a good cook.<eos> Can we offer you a glass of water, wine or beer?<eos> A glass of wine, please.<eos> Red, please.
Thanks.<eos> - You found a really good wine.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Were you admitted to psychology?<eos> - I gave it up.<eos> Why?<eos> Should we tell him?<eos> We want to have a baby.<eos> - A baby?
I--<eos> I thought you--<eos> Of course you did.<eos> Becoming me was the greatest creative project of my life.<eos> So...<eos> FYI, no one else here knows, except for Margo, and that's only because she was my secret partner in the Trials.<eos> Everyone else, I... kind of let them go on thinking I grew up summering with Kennedys, etcetera.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> Just you.
- What?<eos> - Not you.<eos> Ah, hey, Mike.<eos> Sorry. I got--I got a little turned around.<eos> Um, could you tell me which way the cottage is?<eos> Yeah. It's like--<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Help!
How much, uh...<eos> how much time you got?<eos> I, um... almost ten years.<eos> Wow.<eos> Tell me it gets easier.<eos> No, but you do get used to how hard it is.<eos> I'm gonna write that one down, too.<eos> You new here?<eos> To the program or... or, uh, to Venice?<eos> Either.
Yeah. You know, just with Tilly and Kara and...<eos> - The store?<eos> - Yeah, the store.<eos> So, have you thought about what you're gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I need to talk to the bank or something, you know?<eos> Talk to the bank?<eos> Seems to me like you need to rob one.<eos> - I'll get a business loan.<eos> - Yeah, with what?
Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey!<eos> Just you, or...?<eos> No, I'm... I got a friend...<eos> um, acquaintance joining me.<eos> - Oh. What's her name?<eos> - His name, actually.
Yeah, man.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It kind of makes sense, though.<eos> What does?<eos> She was always asking questions about you.<eos> No matter what it was that we were doing, she would always bring it back to you.<eos> Uh-huh. Yeah, it really burned me up at the time.<eos> Now that I know that she had sinister intentions, I don't feel so rejected.<eos> That's great, man.<eos> Good for you.
About a couple hours ago.<eos> Didn't see you boys at the meeting this morning.<eos> Right.<eos> He doesn't want to talk about it.<eos> He just wants to eat his breakfast.<eos> No, I get that.<eos> You can take a beat, circle the wagons.<eos> What do you think, George?<eos> I think she's coming here to sue.<eos> For what?
Yeah.<eos> What are you doing later?<eos> Uh, nothing.<eos> Got no plans.<eos> Why? You want to do something?<eos> A bunch of us are going to march down Abbot Kinney to protest that hotel development.<eos> - You should come.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, what time?
I'm sure it's a real fucking gut punch, but she... she can't use her relationship with Wiener to influence the development one way or the other.<eos> - She wants you to know that.<eos> - "Her relationship with Wiener"?<eos> - She told you that she...<eos> - I didn't realize it was with Wiener...<eos> - Oh.<eos> - ...until just now.<eos> So, um... what were you doing up at the house?<eos> - I want a new deal.<eos> - A new deal?
No.<eos> - He's fucking my ex-wife.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Shit.<eos> I didn't think you guys were divorced yet.<eos> Fucking your wife.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, man, so... he's fucking your wife, and then he tries to evict you from your spot?<eos> He's, like, got it out for you. Huh?<eos> All right!
- More than we need a stool store.<eos> Trust me, it's an upgrade.<eos> If I were you, I'd be more than a little worried about the Save Venice campaign.<eos> They're no joke.<eos> They got momentum.<eos> They got, like, ten thousand signatures on the petition.<eos> They could get a million and it wouldn't make a difference.<eos> It's just public opinion.<eos> You know this is going to ruin the lives of a lot of good people, right?<eos> And yours.
That's why you need to mobilize the troops.<eos> Get everybody on the same page before the big town council meeting tonight.<eos> We got to make sure that the... good people of Venice vote the right way.<eos> This is, like, a "for real" deal emergency type situation.<eos> This is serious.<eos> Fuck yeah, dude.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This has to happen now.<eos> Dude, like, right now?<eos> A 2005?
- Come on, man.<eos> - Come on, tell them like it is, man.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Hello, I'm Chip.<eos> And I'm an alcoholic.<eos> I came to Venice by accident.<eos> Let me rephrase that.<eos> I came to Venice because of an accident.<eos> Ten years ago, I killed a man.<eos> A... A boy, really.
- Hey, John.<eos> Just got a call.<eos> They found a body up near Manatee Bay.<eos> Got any details?<eos> A white male, 40s.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Hey!<eos> Execution style.
- You said you'd send someone to fix it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - That was bungalow...?<eos> - Three.<eos> - I'll get maintenance right over there.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> How was it meeting your new grandson?<eos> He's a lot like Danny was at that age.<eos> You think it was strange, him showing up out of the blue?<eos> Timing and all?
This car once belonged to your father.<eos> Didn't know he owned a car.<eos> Well, there's a lot of shit you don't know about your dad.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> I'm over here.<eos> Okay, get down!<eos> Get on the goddamn floor.<eos> Get back, get down.<eos> Get down on the floor.<eos> On the floor.
It's not that easy.<eos> You should've told me she was alive.<eos> Give me a little time.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He said he needed time.<eos> That's it?<eos> And that Juliette doesn't exist anymore.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Where'd they take you?<eos> Some old warehouse.
Famous ambush of the Romans by the Germanic war chief Arminius?<eos> Three Roman legions were decimated by an alliance of Germanic Tribes?<eos> Come on, it's, like, Rome's Greatest defeat.<eos> You mean like the Alamo?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know, close enough.<eos> Let's put him in protection.<eos> I want to know everyone he came into contact with.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> Someplace safe.
I'm a believer.<eos> I really hope we get a chance to see this thing.<eos> You okay?<eos> I don't even know how to answer that.<eos> You talk to Meisner?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So it's bad?<eos> We're at war.<eos> And nobody knows it.<eos> In my office.
I want you... to do it again.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Wait.<eos> You remember?<eos> No, come on.<eos> Do you want to come swim with me?<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> We should ask him.<eos> Swim to me.<eos> No way.
He's taking all the money!<eos> Where do I find him?<eos> He's coming back here at midnight to pick up his money.<eos> But if you get rid of him, we'll give it to you.<eos> And you can still collect on his head.<eos> It's a win-win.<eos> He's an old drunk.<eos> Should be no problem for a Grimm.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Midnight, huh?
Oliver never believed in you, not like I do.<eos> I can't just stand by after everything you've done and let him get away with it.<eos> So what's this plan of yours?<eos> Oliver doesn't expect you until midnight.<eos> But the person he hired comes at 11:30.<eos> So you come at 11:00.<eos> First, you take care of Oliver.<eos> And then we take care of his assassin together.<eos> So who'd Oliver hire to kill me?<eos> Some girl.
There's much we can do for each other.<eos> Do for you.<eos> What if I could give you both the man and the vengeance you seek?<eos> Do for me and I'll do for you.<eos> I wish to know the purpose of this climb.<eos> To ask Tengri if Kaidu lives or dies.<eos> - Your enemy is on the steppe.<eos> - What enemy?<eos> Kublai travels to the heartland?<eos> Never.
He did a hard thing.<eos> Genghis was born with his destiny ordained by heaven above.<eos> He was descended from Börte Üjin... whose name means "blue-gray wolf."<eos> It was Genghis who founded the Secret Order of the Mongol Knights... picked from the sons of his most loyal generals.<eos> My grandfather's personal guard.<eos> His agents.<eos> His keshig.<eos> But on rare occasions, men of lower blood but of Mongol heart, have achieved rank in the keshig order.<eos> Do you wish to believe in blood, Marco?<eos> Or something bigger than that?
- I don't know yet, but I'm gonna make sure Wally and Jesse are safe.<eos> You know they're gonna figure out a way to stop you, right?<eos> Who? Barry?<eos> Wells?<eos> The police?<eos> No. Nobody can stop me now.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> So... what's your plan?<eos> You're just gonna kill everyone?<eos> Not everyone.
Then why are you keeping me here?<eos> 'Cause I don't want to be alone anymore.<eos> I am never going to be with you.<eos> You think that you're not like me, but I've seen the darkness inside of you, Caitlin.<eos> Just like it was inside Killer Frost.<eos> All you have to do... is unlock it.<eos> Hey.<eos> There she is.<eos> Still refuse to dress like a grown-up, I see.<eos> One grape soda.
Still refuse to dress like a grown-up, I see.<eos> One grape soda.<eos> Ah, no. I'm good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So... what's wrong?<eos> What? Something has to be wrong for me to want to catch up with my brother?<eos> Yeah, that's usually the way it works with you, isn't it?<eos> Actually, I had this... feeling that I should come see you and make sure you're okay, so...<eos> Don't tell me I'm gonna be kidnapped by Snart and his pyromaniac friend again.<eos> Us.
One grape soda.<eos> Ah, no. I'm good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So... what's wrong?<eos> What? Something has to be wrong for me to want to catch up with my brother?<eos> Yeah, that's usually the way it works with you, isn't it?<eos> Actually, I had this... feeling that I should come see you and make sure you're okay, so...<eos> Don't tell me I'm gonna be kidnapped by Snart and his pyromaniac friend again.<eos> Us.<eos> You. Me.
How did that happen?<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> You are messing with something that is out of your control.<eos> And what if it did work?<eos> I mean, what then?<eos> He goes up against Zoom, the monster that snapped his back and almost killed him, and then took the one thing that he's convinced now that he needs in order to make him whole?<eos> This is the way.<eos> This is the only way.<eos> The people of Central City need The Flash.<eos> Guys.
Not really.<eos> What's up?<eos> Do you remember when I told you that I didn't want you going to Earth-2 if you felt like you didn't have anything left here?<eos> Yeah... because Patty left.<eos> It wasn't just because of Patty.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Barry, you've always had someone to come home to.<eos> Me.<eos> I've just been thinking a lot lately...<eos> About us.
Wait, so how are you gonna do that?<eos> It's not even raining outside.<eos> Well, Ramon, you have the wand.<eos> The one I made for Mark Mardon?<eos> No, the one you built for the Harry Potter convention.<eos> Yes, of course, the one you built for Mardon.<eos> How do you know about the Harry Potter convention?<eos> - Get the wand.<eos> Get on the roof.<eos> - Why the roof?
I'll be in the study.<eos> You can't be in the study because my father's staying there.<eos> Everything's turning out just great.<eos> Manolo!<eos> Inma!<eos> Why are you cutting the bread on the tablet?<eos> Cutting it, on the board.<eos> All the useless things you've missed, Pili.<eos> And your Inmaculada has got them all.<eos> All.
You're not used to leaving the cave.<eos> Hey you!<eos> You can't smoke in here.<eos> No?<eos> I'm calling security.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Come on, faster, come on!<eos> Good.<eos> Little by little. Step by step.<eos> Little by little.
Come on, let's run a bit. I'm freezing.<eos> You'll run tomorrow.<eos> Today you're getting a spade and a rake.<eos> Already smoking so early?<eos> You don't have any coffee?<eos> It gives me the shits.<eos> Everything's just great.<eos> Search: effects of marihuana on older people.<eos> Can I have it for a second?<eos> Just a second.
My husband's in the sky, and I'm in heaven.<eos> I'm Noelia.<eos> I love your name, Noelia.<eos> You should hear my phone number then.<eos> Okay then...<eos> Let's see what the sea has for me.<eos> Bye!<eos> See you.<eos> What are you imagining?<eos> Nothing.
I'm Noelia.<eos> I love your name, Noelia.<eos> You should hear my phone number then.<eos> Okay then...<eos> Let's see what the sea has for me.<eos> Bye!<eos> See you.<eos> What are you imagining?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Nothing?
I love your name, Noelia.<eos> You should hear my phone number then.<eos> Okay then...<eos> Let's see what the sea has for me.<eos> Bye!<eos> See you.<eos> What are you imagining?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Nothing?<eos> - Nothing.
Thank you, Inma.<eos> Thanks for everything.<eos> Thanks for loving me this way, faulty and misshapen.<eos> Don't get all excited, I'm doing it out of interest.<eos> Don't forget it.<eos> So you have to love me when I can't do my hundred meters.<eos> And I know you'll be there because I'm going to need you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Into the water.
Yeah!<eos> What have you wished for?<eos> - Eating cake.<eos> - Your wish has been granted.<eos> How are you, Dad?<eos> Great, I'm fantastic.<eos> I'm training again.<eos> Really?<eos> Great.<eos> Who?
I really- - I wish that we could keep you, but with my cancer in remission, we really can't afford it.<eos> What, you're-- you're letting me go?<eos> Just like that?<eos> What about my baby?<eos> What about you and me?<eos> Wow.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> - What-- is it the baby? - Oh.<eos> Did it kick?<eos> First time ever.
Hey, wait.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Yeah, buddy, who got you all snot-nosed?<eos> Oh, my gosh. Who upset my little woodchuck?<eos> They suspended me.<eos> Well, wh-- you weren't fighting, were you?<eos> You're still on probation.<eos> No.<eos> My teacher wouldn't let me share my book report in class and sent me to the principal's office.<eos> Well, what for?
My handle, if you're ever on Instagram.<eos> You not gonna speak?<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Okay, you went from being sprung to being stuck up.<eos> You skipping today?<eos> Nah, I've got too much on my mind.<eos> Trying to get my head straight.<eos> Where's your bodyguard?<eos> Gone.<eos> Probably for a long time.
God must have some serious insomnia.<eos> What do you think, motion of the ocean or actual penetration?<eos> Mm, tricky.<eos> I'm gonna go with A and possible B.<eos> You tell my mama to stop by the house and turn on some lights?<eos> Folks find out we're not home, our crib will turn into a swap meet.<eos> I got it.<eos> Everything's handled.<eos> You call Svetlana and checked on the girls?<eos> Yes, like, a half hour ago.
Will you give me just a little bit of trust?<eos> I got everything handled.<eos> I'm trying to be a hero here.<eos> You're right, babe.<eos> I'm tripping.<eos> I'm sure everything's fine.<eos> Whew, come on, Tommy.<eos> You've done this before, right?<eos> Make it quick.<eos> On three.
I'm trying to be a hero here.<eos> You're right, babe.<eos> I'm tripping.<eos> I'm sure everything's fine.<eos> Whew, come on, Tommy.<eos> You've done this before, right?<eos> Make it quick.<eos> On three.<eos> One two.<eos> - Na Zdorovie.
So, why don't you tell me exactly what the fuck is it we're doing here?<eos> I'm getting back into business... and you're gonna help me do it.<eos> I'm planning a run.<eos> I need information: Where the Feds are looking, and where they're blind.<eos> And if I don't hear from you, I tell my story.<eos> And I got nothing to lose...<eos> so don't think I won't.<eos> He's really got you in a corner, doesn't he?<eos> You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't.<eos> Story of my life.
They've been asking around, but...<eos> - You share anything with them?<eos> - Had nothing to share.<eos> If you did hear anything, you...<eos> Come to me first, would you?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'm in no hurry to run to the feds, John.<eos> I've already served my country.<eos> Sheets?<eos> Everything?
Thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> - It's so nice to meet you. - Yeah.<eos> You, too.<eos> You're just so pretty.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'm sorry about this morning.<eos> Kevin was arrested yesterday.<eos> I didn't tell you.<eos> For what?
They're hard to make out.<eos> Activate quadrant pixel enhancement.<eos> Show-off.<eos> - What is that?<eos> A shadow? - No, the sun direction is wrong.<eos> And look here, it's disconnected from the surface.<eos> It's mimicking a shadow.<eos> It has intelligence.<eos> It's wandering, like it's looking for something.<eos> Or someone.
- What is that?<eos> - Kryptonite.<eos> Guess he doesn't tell you everything.<eos> The rising is coming.<eos> You cannot stop it.<eos> Superman, someone is controlling you.<eos> You have your part to play.<eos> Both of you.<eos> The girl will be taken.<eos> Girl?
There's no time like the present.<eos> No, I mean there's no handle on it.<eos> I can't do this door.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> All right, I gotta let you out.<eos> What, you got a problem?<eos> No.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> It's just that... I think I've seen that car before.<eos> Which one?
Just be a gentleman.<eos> Kara got a new haircut?<eos> Good for her.<eos> I can't believe Cooler told you.<eos> Look, man, I think he was worried that you might overreact.<eos> He finger-raped Pinot!<eos> Like that.<eos> I had to take the dogs to the V.D. clinic.<eos> Dude, I'm not sure you can get V.D. off a finger.<eos> The Venice Dog Clinic.
No.<eos> Not at all. That...<eos> Here, take that.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You might want the air horn.<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - For what?<eos> The transition.
- Jerry's Jerry.<eos> If Jerry wants to sell up, then that's what he wants to do.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Forgive me for saying it, but that wasn't part of the deal.<eos> - It's been ten years.<eos> - Yeah, I know, but you can't just, out of the blue, just...<eos> - That was the deal.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Tilly?<eos> Just a minute.
Can I get you a drink or...?<eos> I thought you didn't drink.<eos> - I don't.<eos> Why?<eos> Did you...?<eos> - No.<eos> No, yeah. Water's good.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Yeah. Just grab a seat.<eos> Or a stool.
I am.<eos> - I thought you had things to take care of.<eos> Yeah, well, he very kindly came to bring me this.<eos> - De-humidifier.<eos> - We live in L.A.<eos> It has a reverse.<eos> Ah, the 2008 "SoCal Design Awards."<eos> - Honorable Mention.<eos> - Did you pretend to look for it?<eos> Not this time.
Don't sweat it.<eos> Honestly, it's no problem.<eos> No.<eos> I was actually thinking that now may be a good time for me to move out.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> - Where to?<eos> - Into the main house.<eos> - With me?<eos> - No, you'd just... you'd pop into here.<eos> - In the guesthouse.
No.<eos> I was actually thinking that now may be a good time for me to move out.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> - Where to?<eos> - Into the main house.<eos> - With me?<eos> - No, you'd just... you'd pop into here.<eos> - In the guesthouse.<eos> - For the night?<eos> Yeah, for the night.
He first moved in when he was... when I was in Europe.<eos> Oh. When was that?<eos> Um... Ten years ago.<eos> I was in Paris.<eos> I had to get out of Venice.<eos> - That's cute.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Career day.<eos> I did a talk at a school.<eos> About wine?
- Sammy, hold this tourniquet.<eos> - Please just let me die.<eos> Dad, that's not just some prisoner.<eos> - Sammy...<eos> - You know who that is?<eos> - I know who it is. - The man you know as Khalil, the man who's been fighting the Caliphate inside Ma'an... that's Barry.<eos> It's over.<eos> The ICC is issuing a warrant of arrest for five counts of crimes against humanity, Jamal.<eos> It's what you always wanted, isn't it?<eos> This job, this power.
Colonel, you do not speak for me or for the Army.<eos> Sir, I realize I'm exceeding my authority here.<eos> This is the price for your officers' cooperation.<eos> I wouldn't celebrate too quickly.<eos> You're married to an Al Fayeed.<eos> One day, they will come for you, too.<eos> - You have our full support.<eos> - Under these conditions?<eos> My extended family is arrested?<eos> For what crimes?
Ahmed's sleeping.<eos> Been sleeping a lot these days.<eos> I wanted to make sure that you're being taken care of.<eos> Well, Aziz is looking after us, as you can see.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> What crimes have we committed?<eos> We were allies,<eos> Bassam, you and I.<eos> If there are people who are angry at our family, who want to see someone punished, you can't let them take their revenge out on me, Bassam.<eos> Or on my son.
You have no political interests.<eos> And you are a national hero.<eos> The Mother of the Revolution.<eos> Haven't you read any of these books?<eos> Oh, Bassam.<eos> You'll be fully independent.<eos> You can ask any question you like.<eos> Call any witness.<eos> You can investigate anything.<eos> Even me.
I said not now!<eos> Is there anything I can do for you, madame?<eos> Anything else?<eos> Did she really commit suicide?<eos> I never asked you.<eos> Of course not.<eos> It's my job to anticipate.<eos> Your son was in an impossible position.<eos> I tried to kill him myself once.<eos> My husband.
So you could do what?<eos> Was this your plan all along?<eos> To drop out of the election?<eos> And why didn't you say so before you took office?<eos> Because then the country needed reassurance.<eos> Now it needs a real election.<eos> And that cannot happen if I run.<eos> I'm afraid for your country, Bassam.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Every day.
- He did, sir.<eos> What's in it?<eos> - You'd like me to open it?<eos> - Unless you have X-ray vision, you will need to open it, so as to be able to tell me what's in it.<eos> Well?<eos> - Some papers about rationing.<eos> - What else?<eos> Some papers from the Exchequer.<eos> Anything from the Foreign Office?<eos> About America or the Soviet Union?
- 10:45, sorry.<eos> There'll be a demonstration by units of the African Rifles.<eos> Christ.<eos> Hold on, would you?<eos> 13:00 drive to Nanyuki airfield and board East African Airways C47 departing on a 13:30 scheduled flight to...<eos> As flags across the nation are lowered in tribute, and news spreads throughout our cities and villages, crowds gather to mourn King George VI.<eos> We are comforted by the knowledge that he spent his final hours in the happy company of his wife and youngest daughter.<eos> For it is as a devoted family man that we, as a nation, shall best remember him.<eos> They don't know.<eos> Sagana.
"A chasm opened up between them, a hallway less than ten yards wide.<eos> But it might as well have been a thousand miles.<eos> A well-appointed no man's land with a plush carpet and high ceiling between two bedrooms.<eos> In it were two centuries of ghosts, all the Presidents and First Ladies before them.<eos> But also the ghost... of their marriage.<eos> A thirty years' war that left them both dead inside and this dead space between them."<eos> He's perceptive.<eos> Uncanny.<eos> Well, it's not who we are.<eos> Not anymore.
He came here one night, after I'd asked you to resign.<eos> He said he was obsessed.<eos> Or maybe he wants back in.<eos> You felt something for him.<eos> Maybe for a moment.<eos> -Did you?<eos> -No, I don't think so.<eos> I felt...<eos> I felt like he saw me.<eos> Me, too.
Loyalty's important, I understand, but your loyalty has to be with me now.<eos> I just can't do it.<eos> All right, then we'll cancel the announcement.<eos> I'll find someone else to be my running mate.<eos> No, I mean, I...<eos> I just can't support this bill.<eos> Oh, but you see, the two go hand in hand now.<eos> So, are you on the ticket or not?<eos> What if the gun bill passes in the House, but not the Senate?<eos> In return for what?
Go, go, go.<eos> -Go!<eos> -Are you hungry?<eos> No money.<eos> You need to go.<eos> You and your money, go.<eos> - I'm calling the cops.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> -The cops, right now... -All right, all right. -I'm calling the cops.<eos> -All right, all right.
You called for me?<eos> There was a man here.<eos> A very bad man.<eos> -Do you live on this block?<eos> -Thirty-three years.<eos> Three... three.<eos> Did you ever see this bad man on your block?<eos> Did you ever see this bad man on your block?<eos> All right.<eos> What about this woman?
And why is that?<eos> Because you never mentioned her one time to me.<eos> Saying nothing says a lot sometimes.<eos> Well, what if the story isn't about how she left, but how she came back.<eos> Just because you're here doesn't mean you're here.<eos> Well, wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Don't you want your ending?<eos> Are you gonna tell me about it?<eos> About the two of you?<eos> No lies.
-I'll see what I can dig up on him. No.<eos> He was fully vetted when he was commissioned for the Joint Chiefs.<eos> No, you go with Seth and draft a statement on the resignation.<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> Let's go.<eos> -What's going on, Doug?<eos> And it's LeAnn's fault.<eos> He never would've resigned if it wasn't for her.<eos> See what you can find.<eos> On the general?
What, roughly, uh, 7% of the vote?<eos> That alone could take this, what, to a second ballot?<eos> That takes it to a second ballot, an open convention again.<eos> Plus, we also assume that Louisiana will stay with Catherine Durant.<eos> So, we are not going to have a definitive idea of how all this is gonna shape up at least until they conduct the first ballot.<eos> There's still no update as to, uh, when the president and Secretary Durant will return.<eos> No, and that adds to some of the uncertainty here.<eos> So let's go back to the floor, see how things are playing out.<eos> It didn't specify in the article which direction the motorcade was heading.<eos> East.
Well, I'm gonna miss you around, Freddy.<eos> There's not many people here...<eos> Well, I guess there aren't that many people here I'm all that comfortable with.<eos> You know what you should do before you go?<eos> You should come up here one night and cook us a rack of ribs.<eos> Now, I realize oven-baked isn't nearly as good as the smoker, but you'd make 'em delicious, anyhow.<eos> Ribs?<eos> Really?<eos> You want me to cook ribs for you.<eos> Well, sure, just like old times.
That was a mistake, and I should've pushed back on it more.<eos> But you can't let him take advantage of it.<eos> Well, I've said it.<eos> It's done.<eos> And now we have to move forward.<eos> This is fucking disgusting.<eos> You say, "After much consideration, I don't feel comfortable negotiating with terrorists."<eos> And then I come off not only as a liar, but as a coward.<eos> Why do this when we're ahead?<eos> By what?
I'm here.<eos> I'm Melissa.<eos> Hi, Melissa.<eos> My name is Will...<eos> You heard her voice.<eos> Now talk.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Yes, I... I've killed a lot of people.<eos> Some of them innocent people.<eos> And every single night...
During the call, Melissa could be heard screaming as Masterson orders Hawthorne to, quote, "Cut out..."<eos> Left of the sink.<eos> - That's when Governor Conway stepped in.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry. You want one? - No, thank you.<eos> - We're going to play some of what he said right now.<eos> - Is it your liver? - Yes, I...<eos> - Clear mind.<eos> - I've killed a lot of people.<eos> Some of them innocent people.<eos> And every...
That's gotta drive you crazy, huh?<eos> How much good press I'm getting out of this.<eos> - What's funny?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Come on, tell me.<eos> I want in on the joke.<eos> You think you can get under my skin.<eos> Oh, I got under your skin the first time we met.<eos> - When?<eos> New Year's? - Mmm-hmm.
And everything we...<eos> Gone.<eos> I feel... numb.<eos> I do, too.<eos> We make time.<eos> We can't fight everything off one by one, Francis.<eos> But if we make this... we make it work for us.<eos> Create chaos.<eos> More than chaos.<eos> War.
This is over.<eos> Everyone but my daughter, out.<eos> Get out.<eos> I don't care what you want.<eos> You will be the first female Khan of Mongolia.<eos> I gave up everything for you.<eos> My life... your mother.<eos> That's not my burden.<eos> Is this punishment?<eos> For Byamba?
I asked him to find a position for Byamba. He did.<eos> Give him back his paper!<eos> You'll be missed while we're in Xanadu.<eos> Someone must watch over Cambulac.<eos> - The quiet will allow me to convalesce. - Hmm.<eos> Find Nayan.<eos> Send him to me.<eos> You're concerned about his support?<eos> No.<eos> Never.
Our forces will strike Kublai dead at a time of our choosing.<eos> I have another problem.<eos> What's that?<eos> Marco.<eos> He's in my affairs.<eos> He's become a nuisance, and nuisances are the first to be swatted dead.<eos> He seems beneath you, no?<eos> Are you protecting him?<eos> I'm lauding you.<eos> Now... on your knees.
Seven thousand are traveling with me?<eos> That's not a show of force. That's a party.<eos> It is not a concern, Sire.<eos> You will travel in safety.<eos> When we have finished putting down the rebellion, I will send everyone I can to Karakorum in time for the Kurultai.<eos> -That's when you'll need them. -Hmm.<eos> Your mother has chosen to stay behind.<eos> Pack up your whore.<eos> She's coming to Xanadu with me.<eos> My whore?
Remove them or I will.<eos> What would you have had me do?<eos> Deny him?<eos> -Why didn't you tell me?<eos> -Is that what maddens you... lack of information?<eos> Not the fact that he stained my body with his sweat and seed?<eos> All of it maddens me!<eos> If we're taking this opportunity... to unburden ourselves of our lies of omission... well, I have one to share.<eos> Your daughter will no longer reside in the House of Kublai.<eos> For in the days ahead...
I'm going to work for Mutiny.<eos> Holding hands with Joe MacMillan never ends well.<eos> I guess it's time to move out to the left coast.<eos> # They all laughed at Christopher Columbus #<eos> Is he doing Frank Sinatra?<eos> He can do Frank Zappa for all I care.<eos> As long as it holds him off.<eos> All right, let's cycle her through again.<eos> - Her?<eos> - Yeah, her.
What?<eos> You're such a little brat.<eos> And I...<eos> I know you're frustrated.<eos> I'm frustrated, too.<eos> We're five people living on top of each other, and that's...<eos> Donna, I'm frustrated because this was supposed to be temporary.<eos> - It is temporary.<eos> - No, it's been six mo...<eos> Oh, shit.
Come on, this Boo Radley-in-the-basement thing is getting kind of creepy.<eos> We're offering you a flame-broiled way out of here.<eos> Look, I don't have time.<eos> This is important, okay?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Whatever.<eos> What a slave.<eos> What, does he sleep late?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Why?
What, so you're feeling good about your life now, so he's just supposed to come running back to you with open arms?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not like that.<eos> Yeah, it is like that.<eos> It is.<eos> I think if he sees this place, and he sees what's possible...<eos> Then he might see that his dad's not a total fuck-up?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Well, that might be good for him.<eos> Good for him.
So, Mr. Baskin, tell us about the most difficult time in your life, a time that made you realize how small and insignificant you were.<eos> It was when my sister died in a car accident.<eos> It was right in front of me.<eos> I was young, but it sent me into a tailspin, a spir...<eos> Don't skimp on the details.<eos> You're meeting the adepts here, the higher-ups on the pyramid, so it is very important that you sound authentic.<eos> Where did you first meet Mark Raymond?<eos> Oh, it was a bookstore on the Lower East Side.<eos> I was browsing through the self-help section, and he saw the book I was holding.<eos> What book?
You do a lot of things, Liam.<eos> But we both know fighting for me is not one of them.<eos> I messed that up.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> And I also know that you tried to fix it.<eos> And I should have let you, but I was so angry.<eos> I should have left her, Miranda.<eos> I know that now.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To the bathroom.
I mean, I hope there was nothing important on there besides, oh, I don't know, all the security measures for the upcoming presidential election.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> That convenient recurring line of anyone you say has been forced to work with this terrorist since it all began.<eos> Elias Harper, the hacker Duncan Howell,<eos> Natalie... and how'd it turn out for them?<eos> You yourself just informed me that this terrorist, with whom you apparently share a cellphone plan, detonated Agent Vasquez, threatened the life of everyone you say you care about, and tasked you into further tricking me to swap out the prescribed medication<eos> of a United States senator for something that you believe to be, but can't be certain, is harmless.<eos> Did I... I leave anything out?<eos> Nuance?
Berlin replaced him last month.<eos> Where did you see that?<eos> Danny knows me.<eos> The minute that he sees Mark Raymond, he's gonna recognize me.<eos> Haas and Wyatt, you're on deck.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> I want those shots.<eos> I just got an e-mail from OPR.<eos> What do I say?<eos> The truth...
FBI!<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You failed.<eos> Why?<eos> The hijacker's dead.<eos> The passengers are safe.<eos> That .40 caliber round passed through my chest, tore a hole in the fuselage, and depressurized the cabin.<eos> You're all dead.<eos> But nice try anyway.<eos> Back of the plane.
- Like a cult?<eos> - My dad rescued me.<eos> My son's a greater danger to himself than you know.<eos> But I do.<eos> I was there.<eos> You thought if you blew yourself up in the middle of the courthouse, - you would show people the truth?<eos> - I was just a kid!<eos> - I'm on a rescue mission.<eos> - Who are you trying to rescue?<eos> My best friend.
Hello.<eos> I'm sorry to come to see you like this, but I came up from Laredo to find out why Natalie hasn't returned my calls.<eos> I was told that she requested emergency leave.<eos> What for?<eos> What would keep her from calling her mother?<eos> Wait.<eos> When is the last time that you heard from her?<eos> Not... Not an e-mail or anything.<eos> When was the last time you heard her voice?<eos> Last Wednesday.
Dan Berlin was taken into custody about an hour ago.<eos> And because of your recording, he confessed to the bombing.<eos> And Ross?<eos> He hanged himself a little over a year ago.<eos> They buried his body on the property.<eos> They notified his family.<eos> There's really nothing we can prosecute there, but that's all right, Caleb.<eos> The Attorney General has already agreed to the deal.<eos> We got him.<eos> The deal?
No.<eos> He needs to rest.<eos> You still love him, huh?<eos> Okay, I'm picking up an illegal log-in on the field office server.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I think it's them.<eos> They're on a cellphone.<eos> Hello?<eos> What were you doing in the field office today?<eos> My job.
They want me to go see a doctor so a doctor will tell me that my career is over.<eos> You passed the physical the last time.<eos> Why would you fail this one?<eos> Because what I have, they can't test for it yet.<eos> But they know what it does.<eos> It doesn't get any better.<eos> That's why you need the help, right?<eos> I lost my football career because I was trying to do the right thing.<eos> And I lost the suit.<eos> Alicia.
You know, we saw these new NATs today, and they're so... They're so bright and shiny.<eos> They have no idea what they're in for.<eos> This... This isn't easy work.<eos> We go undercover with criminals.<eos> We... We face the dark side of humanity every single day.<eos> But we do it 'cause we're making the world a better place.<eos> And I truly believe that.<eos> And whether or not you take that home with you is... It's up to you.<eos> Do you... take it home with you?<eos> Every day.
He will see a way.<eos> There is another question you should be asking yourself.<eos> Can you make your own way?<eos> With he who wishes to remain exclusively Mongol.<eos> ...He who wishes to quell all expansion.<eos> He who despises my pope, Christianity.<eos> The chasm between myself and Kaidu is vast, and I don't like him.<eos> You turned on your Khan.<eos> Not so much turned... as come around.<eos> Xanadu.
Not so much turned... as come around.<eos> Xanadu.<eos> Something, is it not?<eos> It is.<eos> How far?<eos> We're not going to the city.<eos> Come.<eos> Gerel, have a drink. - Oh!<eos> - Here's to our ride to Xanadu.<eos> - Xanadu!
Something, is it not?<eos> It is.<eos> How far?<eos> We're not going to the city.<eos> Come.<eos> Gerel, have a drink. - Oh!<eos> - Here's to our ride to Xanadu.<eos> - Xanadu!<eos> In the morning we ride.<eos> Off to Xanadu!
The one that I told you before.<eos> Yes?<eos> She found me.<eos> She's here.<eos> -How can that be?<eos> -I don't know, but she is.<eos> She wants it back.<eos> All of it.<eos> All of what?<eos> Her life.
Black powder.<eos> Been loading them for weeks.<eos> Where are they headed?<eos> I just lift what and when I'm told to.<eos> Okay, let's go!<eos> Come on, hurry up!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Those barrels of black powder.<eos> What's their destination?<eos> The capital.
And you wish to be just like everyone?<eos> They're Thessalians.<eos> Like Alexander's horse.<eos> Bucephalus.<eos> They are born one color and gradually change coats.<eos> By the time they're four or five, the mares can barely recognize their offspring.<eos> -How do you know all of that?<eos> -I consider myself a student.<eos> -Of horses?<eos> -Of all of it.
We, whose feet lost form from walking the steppe, whose noses grew flat from punishing winds.<eos> We now have more food than our stomachs need.<eos> More warmth than our skin can bear.<eos> And so if you ask, "Why, then? Why do we need more?"<eos> I will tell you... because that is what comes next.<eos> Temujin crawled from the wolf's womb and conquered the Merkit people.<eos> He united our tribesmen and, as a nation, they took North China.<eos> He birthed robust sons...<eos> and those sons sired sons, and together they sacked the Ilkhan,<eos> Persia, Hungary... and the Caspian Sea.
More Mongolia.<eos> That is my gift to you.<eos> One day, each of you will see our nation at its fullest.<eos> Until then... I present a small notion of what our world has to offer.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I need you.<eos> You're my only friend.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> She wants my life.<eos> My child.

Buddy!<eos> Oh, my God, get a room.<eos> Come here, you. Mwah.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Look at you!<eos> Beautiful.<eos> You're like a big woman now. Now that we're all together, let's eat, drink, and be merry.<eos> - You want a drink? - Yes.<eos> A votre santé.<eos> Santé!
Just don't hurt my family.<eos> Assaulting an officer...<eos> You should start thinking about yourself.<eos> I'm not here to kill anyone.<eos> Dad?<eos> Dad, what are they doing to you?<eos> Stay out of it, son.<eos> No.<eos> Where are they taking you?<eos> The precinct.

- That's drug money.<eos> - Yeah, but it's...<eos> That's get-yourself-killed money.<eos> This kind of money?<eos> You could just disappear.<eos> Just, like, buy a boat and just sail off anywhere.<eos> Like where?<eos> Where are you gonna sail to from here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Cuba?
- I'll, like, distract it.<eos> - I'll distract it.<eos> - You go first, you got the stick.<eos> Fuck it, let's go find another trail.<eos> You cool with the way Gus is giving orders?<eos> I mean, don't you find it strange that one day, he's, like, a lawyer with some big law firm and the next, he's selling antiques out of his living room?<eos> His firm was restructured and he wanted to get out of the rat race.<eos> That's what he told us, but a few months ago, I looked it up.<eos> His firm was under investigation and he got disbarred.<eos> - For what?
Shit, no.<eos> Lex?<eos> Besides pull the trigger?<eos> No.<eos> I'll hang onto it.<eos> I played paintball a few times.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Lex, we need a fuse and a car.<eos> You want to hurry the fuck up?<eos> So, uh, nothing too small.
- Some kind of lubricant.<eos> - Yeah, lubricant.<eos> - Suntan lotion.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> You realize Belize can be a very dangerous place.<eos> Oh, yeah, yes, but, you know, we're just on vacation.<eos> And so far, this place is pretty fantastic.<eos> What if I told you I will put you in an airplane back to the United States tonight?<eos> And you will never have to worry about anything here again.<eos> Just you.
- Yeah, lubricant.<eos> - Suntan lotion.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> You realize Belize can be a very dangerous place.<eos> Oh, yeah, yes, but, you know, we're just on vacation.<eos> And so far, this place is pretty fantastic.<eos> What if I told you I will put you in an airplane back to the United States tonight?<eos> And you will never have to worry about anything here again.<eos> Just you.<eos> Just me?
- Wouldn't it be quicker to...<eos> - What?<eos> - No.<eos> - What?<eos> Cut off his head?<eos> Yeah. Okay, yeah.<eos> Great, okay.<eos> Okay. Ready? Here we go.<eos> - One...<eos> - Ugh.
Exactly, so let's hurry it up.<eos> Is it just me or does it bother anyone else that this money is short?<eos> Does it bother anyone else that Jesús has associates in the U.S.?<eos> Does it bother anybody else that the cops may show up at any moment?<eos> How much did you give fender bender woman?<eos> I didn't give fender bender woman anything.<eos> - She took it.<eos> - How much?<eos> Uh, uh, a stack.<eos> At least a full stack.
Hello.<eos> Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call, please.<eos> My friend is arranging a wire transfer from the U.S.<eos> She's not picking up the home phone and I don't know her cell.<eos> How could you not know your wife's cell number?<eos> 'Cause it was on my phone.<eos> Who memorizes cell phone numbers?<eos> What do I do?<eos> Yeah, can you just hold on a second, please?<eos> Just one second. What?
- I can't do it 'cause- because his-his watch is in the way.<eos> There.<eos> - Jackpot Casino.<eos> - How much?<eos> One.<eos> - Winner.<eos> - Nice one, eh?<eos> - How much you win?<eos> - Two dollar.<eos> This day your lucky day.
He's kicking me in the balls!<eos> He kicking me in my balls!<eos> Yeah, bite now, bitch!<eos> - All right! - Wait, wait, we gotta... we gotta lock him up someplace secure while we go to the embassy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The well! We put him in the well.<eos> - Good idea! - Yeah.<eos> Hold up, hold up, hold up.<eos> I don't think that might be the best place.<eos> - No, the well!
Well, how do we get down there?<eos> Leave your car there.<eos> I keep eyes on it for you.<eos> All right.<eos> - Wait!<eos> Whoa! - What?<eos> I don't think we need the luggage.<eos> I don't think I want to leave the luggage in the car.<eos> I thought the whole point was to get the luggage<eos> - into the damn embassy.
- Did you do that on purpose?<eos> It was an accident.<eos> All right, well, come on.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> I got a plane to catch.<eos> Go!<eos> Should we check on him?<eos> He's been down there a long time. So?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Well, us.
There's a design flaw.<eos> Please, Lord... I screwed up my life.<eos> May I please have another shot?<eos> No!<eos> No, you, uh, you had your chance.<eos> Now fuck off.<eos> Still... at least we've seen a tapir.<eos> Captain?<eos> We haven't met, but I know your boss.<eos> My boss?
It's still good to have, right?<eos> Yeah, you can call each other.<eos> Did you enjoy your stay?<eos> - Wonderful.<eos> - Really fun. Wonderful time.<eos> We haven't heard much from Mr. Milo since he retire.<eos> Me drop a package off the other day.<eos> Something he asked me to get for him.<eos> You know if he get it?<eos> A package?
Nothing we can do.<eos> Are you saying that there's something I personally can do?<eos> No, I'm saying the embassy.<eos> I mean, there's an American presence in this country.<eos> Yet the kids, everywhere we go, they're begging.<eos> Some of them probably being exploited.<eos> It's not our purview.<eos> Right, so we don't care.<eos> I get it. Again, do you mean me personally?<eos> - Yes, you.
What, you don't think women spend their lives making men feel comfortable?<eos> Be nice.<eos> Smile.<eos> Ha, oh, no, I'm sorry, you were talking.<eos> Don't get emotional, don't get angry.<eos> Yes, please explain it to me.<eos> No, I'm... I'm not a threat.<eos> Oh, absolutely, gosh, I would love to suck your dick.<eos> Oh, by the way, thanks for staring at my legs earlier.<eos> Sure.
What if Jesús finds out we're in here with all his money?<eos> - How's he gonna find out?<eos> - He's got connections.<eos> You heard what Rochelle said.<eos> - The staff aren't local.<eos> - Yeah, but the patients are.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Have you seen our father?<eos> Our uncle?
I... I manage people's money.<eos> Um... I take people's money, and then I try to make them more money.<eos> And then in exchange, my firm gets to keep some of that money, and then I get to keep some of that money.<eos> You like this job?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I need the money.<eos> Mm. To pay for all the food to be delivered.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And other things.
Back your asses up!<eos> Nine lives.<eos> These people mine!<eos> - What the hell is this?<eos> - Out!<eos> Now!<eos> I barely know them.<eos> I don't...<eos> Shut up!<eos> In the van.
I have no fucking clue.<eos> This is good.<eos> Rose hip.<eos> What's a rose hip?<eos> Assuming they got Joel with his share plus your quarter, we're only short half the money.<eos> Only short half.<eos> Dude, we can't show up there with only half.<eos> Then what are we supposed to do?<eos> If we go there without all of the money, all of us are going to be killed.<eos> All of us.
We drone-kill Americans in foreign lands.<eos> Why don't you give them the good news?<eos> The good news is I'm in a position to make all this go away.<eos> - Aaron has connections.<eos> Not to mention your passports.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What do you want from us?<eos> To deliver a package.<eos> In exchange, I'll make all your problems disappear.<eos> - What package?
I'm opening the gate.<eos> It's still not our money.<eos> Okay, we're not the bad guys here.<eos> We are here to help you!<eos> Will someone shut the fucking dog up?<eos> Okay, we're all just trying to survive!<eos> You, us, everybody.<eos> Then why are you waving a gun at us?<eos> Here, look.<eos> No waving, okay?
- Okay.<eos> Ready?<eos> Ready?<eos> I'm just gonna pull you up.<eos> Ready?<eos> Ah, ah, ah, wait, wait, wait!<eos> - What?<eos> - My... my foot is stuck.<eos> Just wiggle a little bit.<eos> Yeah, yeah, one, two...
Yes, uh, can I use your computer?<eos> I need to book a flight.<eos> Why don't you let me?<eos> When were you hoping to fly?<eos> Now.<eos> Today.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Uh... as soon as I can.<eos> Also I need to, uh, wire most of this to the United States, and I have a very specific way of doing it.<eos> - Most of it? - Yeah.
Joel, call me when you get this.<eos> We are booked on a 5:00 P.M. flight.<eos> Just get to the airport.<eos> Everything's waiting for you at the desk.<eos> Ticket, passport.<eos> I'll explain when you get here.<eos> We are going home.<eos> Oh, it... broke.<eos> We've printed your travel details, and the wire is still going through.<eos> Just a minute.
Who's apologizing?<eos> Frankly, I don't have another apology left in me.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> Um, I'm traveling tonight and, uh, wanted to get a tin of those hard candies.<eos> You guys sell those, right?<eos> You came to make jokes?<eos> No.<eos> Look...<eos> Look, I-I know your family's pretty upset - about what happened to the dog.<eos> - Only Aunt Shiraine.
You're very good at diversion tactics, aren't you? Am I?<eos> I'm dressed up because I'm going to a funeral this afternoon.<eos> So is my granny - and my Auntie Clare.<eos> Is she?<eos> Are they?<eos> I wanted to go as well so I wouldn't have to come to school, but they wouldn't let me.<eos> Did you know Helen as well, then? Helen?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm going to someone else's funeral.<eos> Whose?
Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> It might be two days.<eos> Hopefully not.<eos> If it's going to be any longer than that, I'll let you know.<eos> - You need to catch this bastard. - Yeah, we will.<eos> - Right, see you.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Ta-ta.<eos> Where's he going?<eos> Work.
No.<eos> Have you ever contemplated killing yourself?<eos> Have you ever TRIED to kill yourself?<eos> No.<eos> Have you ever thought about how you might do it if you did?<eos> I've seen all of 'em and none of 'em are pretty.<eos> They're all...<eos> All what?<eos> Sordid.<eos> Ridiculous.
No.<eos> But...<eos> Yeah?<eos> ..maybe...<eos> Yeah, whenever.<eos> ...later in the...<eos> Yeah... week.<eos> Where are you off?<eos> Anywhere exciting?<eos> Postmortem.
Yeah.<eos> But, listen, don't get cross!<eos> He said that, but then nothing could be further from the truth.<eos> Once he started, it was like he could talk about nothing else.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said how much he liked you when he met you outside the shop and on the boat and how he still thinks about you.<eos> Did he say that?<eos> Did he actually say that?<eos> That he still thinks about me?<eos> Every day.
Brunhilde?<eos> Miss Trunchbull.<eos> Sergeant Cawood.<eos> I'll put it on his desk.<eos> You still want to go for a drink?<eos> Well, yeah. Yeah, if you...<eos> I would!<eos> Tonight?<eos> Moorings?<eos> Seven?
Sergeant Cawood.<eos> I'll put it on his desk.<eos> You still want to go for a drink?<eos> Well, yeah. Yeah, if you...<eos> I would!<eos> Tonight?<eos> Moorings?<eos> Seven?<eos> Half past?<eos> Great. Seven.
I'm sorry, Sergeant.<eos> Right. I'm going home for 40 minutes to say happy birthday to my grandson, get changed, then straight back here in time for the eight o'clock shift.<eos> I'm not reporting you to professional standards, although God knows why - I should be doing.<eos> But, please, just learn something from it.<eos> You'll need to make statements.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Where've you been?<eos> Oh, I got a phone call.<eos> This lass got raped.<eos> - What lass?
Having an offensive weapon in a public place.<eos> - He'd never...<eos> - It's all on CCTV.<eos> So, Daryl, I'm arresting you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court.<eos> Anything you do say may be given in evidence.<eos> - Could you stand up, please?<eos> - They start it.<eos> Every time.
It's not addressed to me.<eos> I'm giving you permission.<eos> Come on, hurry up, I'm going to beat you.<eos> There's a year's supply of birthday cake in the kitchen, if anybody's interested.<eos> - Right, get that dismantled, now.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What's up, Catherine?<eos> Get it back in the box. In the bin.<eos> Straight in the bin!
Yep.<eos> Guess who got him arrested.<eos> She didn't?<eos> Have they charged him?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> I think they're still questioning him.<eos> A breakthrough for the detectives working on the spate of murders which has shocked the local community...<eos> You are stopping tonight, aren't you?<eos> I knew Vicky Fleming.<eos> That woman.
Especially if they say they're sorry.<eos> That's right.<eos> However angry or upset we might feel.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> There you go, eh?<eos> So I was thinking, maybe it was his way of trying to say sorry for what he did, sending me that Scalextric, me dad.<eos> Ryan, you've got to stop calling him your dad.<eos> You've got to stop thinking about this man as your dad.<eos> A dad is someone who's there.<eos> Every day.
Things.<eos> What things?<eos> I think you'll be cross.<eos> No, don't turn the light on.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> What is it you've done, love?<eos> You know you can tell me anything.<eos> I've always said that. Haven't I?<eos> If you tell me the truth, I won't be cross.<eos> About anything.
You'll visit me, won't you, in prison?<eos> I don't think you'd like prison.<eos> No, but if you can't think of anything, then it's what'll happen.<eos> - How's Neil?<eos> - He's gone to work.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Half six this morning.<eos> That's good.<eos> Hey, have you run that theory past Clare, Mum?<eos> - What theory?
- How much?<eos> - Couple of thousand.<eos> We've got our passports.<eos> We'll call a taxi.<eos> Get on a train to Manchester.<eos> Then we'll get on an aeroplane. And they might catch up with us eventually<eos> - I think they very probably would - but at least you'll have done something. At least we'd have seen something of the world, had an adventure, wouldn't we?<eos> Las Vegas?<eos> Is that what you'd like?<eos> Nevada.

What you doing?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Bravo November 4-5.<eos> I'm chasing -- it's complicated -- 'but I'm chasing DS John Wadsworth, who I believe has been involved in the murder of Vicky Fleming.'<eos> Follow that BMW!<eos> Put your foot down.<eos> Units to Sowerby Bridge railway station.<eos> For once in your life, in the right place at the right time, doesn't it feel good, eh?<eos> God knows what his plans are, but this is a dead end.<eos> Oh, bollocks!
They're just people -- people you don't even like -- they're just people you've had on your phone for years!<eos> I know!<eos> I know.<eos> I know how she operated.<eos> Look, she ruined people's lives, I tell you, this bloke I know...<eos> I asked her to just let me go and she wouldn't, and I begged her!<eos> And I didn't mean to kill her.<eos> Well, I didn't go in there to kill her, it just...<eos> And so I did this ridiculous thing to her.<eos> Hideous.
- An orang-utan.<eos> - Oh, perfect.<eos> - OK, a Doberman.<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> - A Great Dane?<eos> - No. A Siberian Husky. A St Bernard!<eos> Ha! Is that a yes?<eos> - Why can't you get something smaller?<eos> - Like a pit bull?<eos> No, like a goldfish.
I don't suppose you two could tell me where you were the last few hours?<eos> We were looking for clues. Here.<eos> The photos with time stamps on them.<eos> Keep an eye on these two.<eos> You think the victim could be another treasure hunter?<eos> Makes sense.<eos> The body was found just below where they had to climb up.<eos> Maybe the victim was in the lead, second place comes along, shoves him off the ledge to get in first place.<eos> Then stole his phone to see if first place had any clues that the killer hadn't gotten yet.<eos> Plausible.
He dies and you wind up with this?<eos> I won that flash drive fair and square.<eos> That's a $100,000 by the way and it is mine.<eos> No.<eos> It's not.<eos> Now it's part of a murder investigation.<eos> Wait.<eos> I can prove I didn't do it.<eos> This guy filmed the entire event?<eos> With a GoPro?
There must be 15 of them.<eos> Could be more.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Did I waste your time?<eos> No.<eos> But I must take these back to the shop.<eos> Of course.<eos> So this is Nick's new home, sweet home.<eos> Wouldn't be the first place you'd look for him.<eos> Or the last.
Books.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you relatives of Mr. Nebojsa?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I'm here doing an appraisal on the property...<eos> Where are the books?<eos> There aren't any books.<eos> They've all been taken.<eos> Where?<eos> Leipzig.
One of Black Claw's missions is to eradicate all things Grimm... Including Grimms.<eos> Can you get us the $100,000 that Monroe's uncle wants?<eos> We only have 24 hours.<eos> Actually, make that 22 1/2.<eos> And my uncle will not hang around.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> But this is government money from a fund that doesn't exist, so I can't make any promises.<eos> This is Felix Dietrich.<eos> I received your text.<eos> Ja, uh, ein Moment.
I pulled the SIM card.<eos> It's being checked.<eos> Well, your uncle said the antiques dealer was killed in the house where the books were.<eos> I think so, yeah.<eos> Well, what if it's the same guys?<eos> They could have easily found out your uncle got the books from the dealer and followed him here.<eos> You know, I called my uncle at his bookshop, and it was late, but he always works late.<eos> And somebody else answered the phone.<eos> - You tell them anything?<eos> - Just my name.
But I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> I know... a Downworlder can't defend a Shadowhunter in court.<eos> But a Shadowhunter accused of a crime can choose any advocate.<eos> That can't mean a Downworlder.<eos> The Clave was so rigid and prejudiced back in what they call the Time of Angels that they didn't dream of a Shadowhunter asking a Downworlder for help.<eos> They didn't even bother to exclude us.<eos> So, since, as you all say...<eos> "the Law is the Law..."<eos> there's no stopping me from slipping through this gaping loophole.<eos> For the right price.
Rumors.<eos> When the Lightwoods took Jace into the New York Institute, we thought Michael got hit.<eos> There were a lot of Circle members who were trying to avenge Valentine back then.<eos> Was that 19 years ago?<eos> It was 20.<eos> Why?<eos> Twenty.<eos> Luke, look.<eos> Come on!<eos> Again.
Nail in the coffin.<eos> Mistress Poldark!<eos> How delightful!<eos> Mr Penvenen!<eos> To think of us meeting again so soon!<eos> And may I introduce my niece, Caroline?<eos> Mistress Demelza Poldark of Nampara.<eos> And Mr Unwin Trevaunance.<eos> Are you here for the election, ma'am?<eos> Er... No, ma'am, for the assizes.
The mine he will leave to his wife.<eos> We can soon acquire the shares.<eos> Was she not his kitchen maid?<eos> - She will give us no trouble.<eos> - Do not believe it.<eos> You will be celebrating tonight.<eos> I certainly intend to.<eos> You could not bear to keep away.<eos> I was concerned.<eos> For me?
Sit here, my dear.<eos> May I get you a glass of wine?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Stay a little longer with us!<eos> Nay, Jinny, leave him be.<eos> They'll be wantin' to be away home.<eos> Caroline.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - To Westminster!
Thank you.<eos> - To Westminster!<eos> - To Ross Poldark.<eos> You must toast as your uncle bids you, Caroline.<eos> You are his ward and you must obey his wishes.<eos> And what are his wishes?<eos> Why, for you to engage yourself to a man of substance and repute.<eos> I intend to.<eos> Here's to Ross!<eos> To Ross!
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> What must I do to enact this curse?<eos> You need to sacrifice the heart of the thing you love most.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Aah! This isn't fair to Killian.<eos> Gold tricked him.<eos> I'm getting him back.<eos> You're going to Hell?<eos> The Underworld.
It lets you communicate with the dead.<eos> Pour this over Hook's grave, and we can stop guessing where he is and simply ask him.<eos> You're saying Hook has a grave here in the Underworld?<eos> Everyone down here has a grave.<eos> You'll find the cemetery right where you remember it.<eos> Well, if this works, we could find Hook before the boat leaves.<eos> We could all get out of here together.<eos> A fine idea.<eos> I suggest you all get moving.<eos> No way.
I did what no one else could do, Regina.<eos> I've brought you your revenge.<eos> Snow White's beating heart.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Crush it, and she dies at last.<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> Bring the Magic Mirror.<eos> Show us Snow White.<eos> To my stepmother!

I wasn't bluffing...<eos> I'm happy to tell Belle about your return to Dark One-ness.<eos> Our agreement was to find your pirate and get the hell out of here.<eos> If you want to distract yourself with this other asinine pursuit, be my guest.<eos> I'm out.<eos> So... who's ready for "Operation Firebird"?<eos> Is that what we're calling it?<eos> You referring to the mythological bird or the muscle car?<eos> Did you hear that, Cora?<eos> The music?
So what is he talking about?<eos> I know you didn't manage to screw the whole town up all over again while I was on my weekend trip to limbo.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> You weren't gone for just the weekend.<eos> You've been gone for weeks.<eos> Ellis, tell your friends to bring something back from their hunt.<eos> We need to stock the bar for happy hour.<eos> Hey!<eos> No killing dinner.<eos> On my count.
Look, we can't have him turn against us.<eos> So we have to think about him in this situation.<eos> He cares about you, Paige.<eos> He- - He doesn't want to see you hurt.<eos> Watch your step, ma'am.<eos> Nothing wrong with the dog at all.<eos> But that damn vet kept ordering test after test after test.<eos> I'm telling you, when I saw the bill--<eos> Really? Nothing wrong with the dog?<eos> - Not a damn thing.
Well, I think we can help each other.<eos> How?<eos> It's not much, but, you know, they'll be new to you, I think.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> - How did you--<eos> - All over.<eos> - Where did you--<eos> - You don't want to know.<eos> But you're welcome to 'em.<eos> In exchange for what?
I'll help you find your way.<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - What?<eos> I thought you were spending the morning with us.<eos> I, uh, have a last minute assignment due that I haven't even started yet, so...<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Well, we'll see you tonight, right?<eos> Clarissa?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - For what?
And our 4D, breaking-the-speed-barrier Internet was born.<eos> Says my talented developer.<eos> People said I was mad, so...<eos> I owned it, hmm?<eos> Thank you so much for the gig, Mr. M.<eos> Simon, how many times do I have to tell you?<eos> Sorry...<eos> Val.<eos> Poker night.<eos> Next Saturday, all right?
Alec!<eos> You know where he is?<eos> Check it again.<eos> I told you, I'm on the list.<eos> You're not here.<eos> What seems to be the problem?<eos> This one wants to crash the party.<eos> I'll be responsible for this one.<eos> Come on in.<eos> To us.
Human blood.<eos> Everything's out of control.<eos> We were fools to believe Valentine was dead.<eos> Previously on Shadowhunters...<eos> My sister wants you to be her defense attorney.<eos> For the right price.
You're talking about Alec's feelings for Magnus?<eos> - I'm not blind.<eos> - If... if you're not in love with Alec, then why are you going through with this marriage?<eos> Alec's love for his family and his desire to restore the Lightwood name has touched me in ways that I haven't felt in a very long time.<eos> Alec is a man of honor... and I truly care about him.<eos> But what about Alec's happiness?<eos> Shadowhunters know that our duty to our family supersedes our personal desires.<eos> Look, I know that you're still new to this world and our traditions may seem foreign to you,<eos> - but I...<eos> - Yeah, more like ice cold.
And you will no longer bother me.<eos> Now, I suggest you enjoy your freedom before I change my mind.<eos> For Shadowhunters, you don't seem to do a lot of Shadowhunting.<eos> There is more to the job than killing demons.<eos> We need to talk to Camille.<eos> We know you have her here.<eos> We tracked her to the DuMort.<eos> It's true, but I'm afraid she's a bit tied up at the moment.<eos> Is there something I can help you with?<eos> Just a second.
Maybe the clue has something to do with color, you know?<eos> White is the absence of color, so...<eos> Or is that black?<eos> Simon, just let me think for a second.<eos> Clary, that's a cookbook.<eos> I've seen this before.<eos> Chicken cacciatore, remember?<eos> My mom used to make it all the time.<eos> How could I forget?<eos> Even better the next day.
Agreed.<eos> Then how 'bout giving me a weapon?<eos> It's not like I can run.<eos> Come on, give him a gun.<eos> 15 seconds!<eos> The Cabal, the ones coming for Liz...<eos> They're not gonna get her.<eos> Let's just get it over with.<eos> Check for survivors.<eos> Knees!
There it is.<eos> 'And, as Celia crosses over, it's gone.<eos> 'Oh, yeah, I never noticed.<eos> - 'No, people don't.<eos> 'Meanwhile, the stagehand is creeping round 'to rehang it above the fireplace.<eos> 'You can see here that the little boy was a bit distracted.<eos> 'Look at the way he's looking.<eos> 'But, otherwise, I think we got away with it.<eos> 'And this was all filmed in one day?<eos> 'Yes, one day.
There's that expression again.<eos> Catch your death.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> - Yes, I understand now, you said the Krampus only comes for children, and I'm pregnant.<eos> Yes?<eos> But that's not all, is it?<eos> He only comes for the bad children.<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> There's something I haven't told you.<eos> Something about this child.
Don't worry, Julian.<eos> I'll look after her now.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> 'And there's your ending.<eos> 'Well, not quite.'<eos> Right, we've got ten minutes to get the final scene.<eos> Cameras, round to the bedroom, please.<eos> Dennis is coming down to the floor.<eos> 'What does that mean, coming down to the floor?<eos> 'The studio floor.
Sorry.<eos> You lost your wife and a baby.<eos> If feelings get hurt...<eos> I think your family will give you a pass.<eos> That's just it...<eos> You're not family anymore.<eos> I didn't say that to point fingers.<eos> It's true. I'm not.<eos> Is that why you didn't bring me any pickles?<eos> Next time.
Some plead, some barter.<eos> No man has ever thanked me before.<eos> Very genteel.<eos> This time I've had with you...<eos> I haven't had to think or choose.<eos> It's the most free I've ever been.<eos> I told you, you would fall in love.<eos> No offense, but...<eos> I haven't.<eos> Not with me.
What are the Arab's orders?<eos> Not the Arab, the Christian.<eos> Nayan sent word.<eos> You ride for his encampment.<eos> To dying exhausted.<eos> The traitors fly a false flag.<eos> Kaidu.<eos> I'd do the same if I weren't playing by the rules.<eos> Why risk the wrath of the Khan's army so close to the Kurultai?<eos> What wrath?
How long will it take Kublai to realize it was us?<eos> Shorter than it's going to take the chieftains to prove it wasn't.<eos> And by then, Father will be Khan.<eos> Flags and armor.<eos> They only know what they see.<eos> It seems our raids were successful.<eos> Jingim and a contingent of warriors ride our way.<eos> And?<eos> We're to kill them.<eos> All of them.
I don't think it's wholly the election Kaidu's after, but humiliation.<eos> He wants to shame me.<eos> Disgrace my name.<eos> Would he be justified in his quest?<eos> I want you to know who it is you're protecting.<eos> I do.<eos> Go.<eos> What is it?<eos> We're riding the wrong way.<eos> East.
How'd it go with mama?<eos> Oh, her, uh, alibi checks out.<eos> She was in a cab by 8:15.<eos> And it looks as though Robyn was working with a new crew.<eos> I had a really great time earlier.<eos> Me too.<eos> Is it wrong that I want to kiss you right now?<eos> So wrong, it's right.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - For what?
So let's get to work.<eos> What can I do to help?<eos> All right.<eos> We know that Robyn was meeting with her new crew twice a week in Spanish Harlem.<eos> And I think these symbols on her phone have something to do with her next meeting.<eos> So, what's the problem?<eos> I don't speak emoji.<eos> I think that first symbol there... The buttony thing... is a clock, obviously.<eos> Uh-huh, and the hands are on 12, so Robyn's crew is meeting at noon.<eos> Not noon... midnight.
You didn't invite me.<eos> I had to sneak in just to take the entrance exam.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I felt responsible for what happened to your brother, and I didn't want to cause your family another loss.<eos> Alice, I was wrong.<eos> You are far too gifted not to be with us.<eos> Just come back for a week, and if you don't like it, then, please, by all means, be a farmhand.<eos> This year, we're going to win the alumni week Hunger Games.<eos> My mentor last year was a nun.<eos> Never again.
- Quentin.<eos> Quentin!<eos> Get your head out of your twat and throw the damn globe.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Are you sure you want to do that?<eos> Q, are you controlling this?<eos> Do something, Q!<eos> One spell so powerful, it wiped the whole board.<eos> To Quentin!
Margo, you look so beautiful.<eos> Uh, I--I can't even--<eos> I got this.<eos> Tell me your name again.<eos> - Todd.<eos> - Todd.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> Encanto Oculto is a solid week of sun, drugs, and magical art.<eos> Time stops, reality bends, and you fuck five times a day.<eos> On a bad day.
Oh, shit.<eos> Not gin-- G-I-N.<eos> This summons a djinn- D-J-I-N-N.<eos> - A genie?<eos> - Cool.<eos> Shut up, Todd.<eos> Wait, this could be great.<eos> I mean, if he grants wishes for real, and we bring him to Ibiza, I mean-- that's a fuckin' regalo!<eos> Okay, this genie totally gets me.<eos> The fuck?
I'm sure we can find a direct flight.<eos> - To where? - Uh...<eos> Scurry along, Ronald.<eos> Raymond.<eos> Raymond.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> Uh... So you seem good.<eos> Could use a top-up.<eos> So where are you flying off to, exactly?<eos> Uh, England.
Anything.<eos> Kill me.<eos> That's--that's crazy.<eos> I'm allowed to be done.<eos> - No. I can't.<eos> - Well, I need you to.<eos> You knew.<eos> You knew, and you did--<eos> No, I did not sign up for this.<eos> Then what?
Kill me.<eos> That's--that's crazy.<eos> I'm allowed to be done.<eos> - No. I can't.<eos> - Well, I need you to.<eos> You knew.<eos> You knew, and you did--<eos> No, I did not sign up for this.<eos> Then what?<eos> Pleasantries?
- I didn't see anything!<eos> - I swear.<eos> - May God punish you.<eos> - My brother is a good man.<eos> - No.<eos> You all hound him.<eos> It's your fault.<eos> Stop.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> To the quiet place, for the best.
Uh, so... what do I call you?<eos> Like, Richard or Failstaff or...<eos> Richard, though some of the others might prefer their log-in names.<eos> Hey, when was the last time you unplugged?<eos> - It's been a while. - Oh.<eos> But, I mean, when was the last time I had actual friends to discuss "Godel, Escher, Bach" with?<eos> The portals are gonna take me a couple hours to calculate if you want to, you know, straighten up.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Listen, do you mind if we commandeer the guest room for the project?<eos> Um, what project?
We need the spell to work, right?<eos> I can't believe I'm letting your boyfriend talk to my boyfriend about how to... ugh.<eos> I've never been prouder, although I must say this one seems like an awful lot of work.<eos> Who?<eos> Quentin? You're complicated.<eos> You need somebody who gets that about you.<eos> Maybe several people.<eos> Don't take this the wrong way, Mom, but shut the fuck up, okay?<eos> We'll talk when you're less cranky.<eos> Cheers.
I'm so sorry, Andrea.<eos> I thought that if I supported her, she'd have the strength to help herself.<eos> If she doesn't want to, you can't make her change.<eos> Yeah, but... I didn't have to help her fall.<eos> This time's on me.<eos> Hey, daddy.<eos> Well, this is a nice surprise.<eos> You coming from group?<eos> I got a job.<eos> A job?
I'm merely questioning...<eos> I'm urging you not to consign your trust too quickly.<eos> That's all.<eos> I came to see you ahead of this meeting as a matter of courtesy, not to seek your counsel.<eos> Comb your hair, at least.<eos> Today the tide turns, Havisham.<eos> I can't wait to see how the shareholders take to a woman at the helm.<eos> Thank you for your company, Sir Leicester.<eos> A very pleasant start to the day's work.<eos> Not at all.
Your life, the life of your loved ones is mine.<eos> All of it!<eos> Crushed by the debt you owe to me and that gives me pleasure, so why should I be kind?<eos> Exactly so, Mr Venus.<eos> Our killer is an ordinary man, pushed to the very limit of what was bearable.<eos> And he snapped.<eos> Don't announce me, I want to surprise her.<eos> You haven't touched your cordial, Mr Venus.<eos> I'm worried about this man.<eos> The killer?
Mr Marley had his wallet stolen and only two days later Mr Scrooge has confirmed you paid off part of your debt.<eos> Perhaps you could tell me where you found the money that enabled you to do this.<eos> Such is my financial desperation, I was forced to sell my late wife's engagement ring.<eos> I burn with the shame of my betrayal of her.<eos> I used the money from the sale to pay a part of my debt.<eos> This debt was the cause of your altercation with Mr Marley?<eos> He increased the interest on it threefold as a penalty for late payment.<eos> He appeared to take great pleasure in my plight, which, angered me.<eos> What time would this be?<eos> Possibly, eight or nine o'clock.
- (GROWLING) - Mary, could you take him?<eos> If only he could talk, he may explain why he barks at the man who rescued him.<eos> If only.<eos> To Mr Compeyson, without whom some of us literally wouldn't be here.<eos> AMELIA: Mr Compeyson.<eos> There's someone else I'd like to toast.<eos> Someone who's unaware how much he means to me. Because I tell him all to rarely.<eos> So, I'd like to tell him now that I'm proud to have him back here at Satis House.<eos> As it should be. As I hope it always will be.<eos> To Arthur.

True.<eos> More drinks!<eos> We haven't finished these yet, Arthur.<eos> Come on, Pocket. Drink up.<eos> Don't tell me there's a lily-liver among us!<eos> Three large whiskies please and er...<eos> - .. keep the change.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I owe you an apology, Compeyson.<eos> About what?
) - I'm quite overcome.<eos> - That ain't what I mean.<eos> I mean you and Fagin, the way he treats you.<eos> - Anyway, that will change soon enough.<eos> - How?<eos> Change how, Bill?<eos> I paid him some and will get the rest as soon as I can.<eos> - Paid for what?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> For you.
It was as though the world lost its last good man.<eos> And now?<eos> And now there is you, Mr Meriwether Compeyson.<eos> You've shown me only kindness since the second we met and yet never asked for anything in return.<eos> Well, I've been skittish at best.<eos> - Truculent, even.<eos> I admit I don't quite know why you maintained your interest in me.<eos> Because beneath all that stiff and shiny Havisham veneer, I saw something else.<eos> What?<eos> A little girl.
- Excellent. BUTLER:<eos> Out of my way. BUTLER:<eos> One moment, please!<eos> Get out of my way, girl.<eos> This is my house.<eos> - I'm sorry, Miss... - It's all right, Mary, you may go.<eos> That's right, Mary.<eos> Do as my darling sister says. You may go.<eos> Ah, Compeyson!<eos> Cheers.
There are more important things to worry about than little Bumble.<eos> - There are?<eos> - Yes!<eos> You must wear in your suit.<eos> It must not look new when you attend the interview.<eos> It must appear as though it is just one of your many suits.<eos> But it's my only suit.<eos> They must think you a man of means, not a man with only one suit.<eos> Wear it in.<eos> Back to work, Inspector?
You seem pleased.<eos> I've just had a rather excellent meeting with a merchant, an introduction from Sir Leicester.<eos> Could prove very lucrative.<eos> Police business, Miss.<eos> This wallet do you recognise it?<eos> I think so.<eos> It's been altered, but...<eos> Do you remember the man who bought it?<eos> I believe it was Mr Compeyson, sir.<eos> A week ago.
I urge you once more to reconsider.<eos> Your valuation is absurdly high.<eos> If I need your advice about legal matters, Mr Jaggers, then I will consult you.<eos> And whose advice led you to this?<eos> I trust my own counsel, thank you, sir.<eos> I do hope so.<eos> Amelia...<eos> Arthur.<eos> Mr Compeyson?<eos> A word.
I don't have a penny.<eos> But Captain Hawdon will pay you.<eos> He'll give you a sixpence.<eos> A shiny, silver sixpence.<eos> It's SO important.<eos> Go!<eos> Run!<eos> Run!<eos> Just a minute!<eos> One minute!
He'll give you a sixpence.<eos> A shiny, silver sixpence.<eos> It's SO important.<eos> Go!<eos> Run!<eos> Run!<eos> Just a minute!<eos> One minute!<eos> I'm coming!<eos> One minute!
I can see you in that.<eos> Let me buy it for you.<eos> - A little daring, don't you think?<eos> - Very well.<eos> I dare you.<eos> Ah, Mr Havisham.<eos> - Not now, Mr Scrooge...<eos> - So sorry to disturb you.<eos> Tell me, when would be a good time to discuss the money you owe?<eos> A month?
A month?<eos> A year?<eos> Perhaps you'd like some more of my money to tide you over?<eos> You will be paid in full.<eos> I hold share certificates to the Havisham Brewery.<eos> I have no doubt I will be paid, I simply wish to discuss the time and manner of the repayments.<eos> I'm soon to come into a substantial amount of money.<eos> You will be paid then.<eos> Ah, and when is this "windfall" likely to materialise?<eos> - A week or two perhaps.

Good.<eos> Then it's settled.<eos> You have my permission and, indeed, my blessing.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Now, where's that port?<eos> Ah, Frances, there's a bottle in the study, would you be so kind?<eos> Yes, Father.<eos> - A toast.<eos> - Yes.<eos> To the future.
Whatever occurred, be glad of it.<eos> He came to town a broken man.<eos> He returned...<eos> Like that.<eos> Mr Paynter!<eos> Who, sir?<eos> Me, sir?<eos> Nay, not I, sir.<eos> You will recall the bargain we struck some time ago?<eos> Bargain?
I doubt you can save him.<eos> The ladies have deserted us.<eos> Yes. Perhaps we bore them!<eos> Perhaps!<eos> I think I must go to bed.<eos> I find I'm less able to hold my liquor these days.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Stay. Finish your drink.<eos> Thank you, Cousin.<eos> For what?
I'm weary to the bone.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I did see him with my own eyes.<eos> Elizabeth looked well tonight.<eos> She did.<eos> Her mother thinks were she not wed to Francis, she'd have half the aristocracy at her feet.<eos> But she is wed to Francis.<eos> And she seems content to be so.<eos> Do you remember our last visit here?<eos> At Christmas?
The Navy, perhaps?<eos> You'd enjoy ship's rations!<eos> Salt pork, dried biscuit, weevils.<eos> No doubt!<eos> And be all the healthier for it!<eos> Of course.<eos> What?<eos> Biscuit, salt, no fresh fruit, no green vegetables!<eos> I thank you, Ross!<eos> What for?
No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But children are the natural consequence of marriage, are they not?<eos> It would appear so.<eos> "Dear Madam, I am happy to hear of your recovery "but be assured, as to payment, I am amply recompensed by the knowledge of your gratitude."<eos> "To you, Dr Enys, "No doubt the saving of my life seems a very small service. "to me, it assumes a slightly greater significance.<eos> "I therefore enclose a guinea, which is the smallest value, "little as I esteem myself, that I could put upon your services.<eos> "Be so kind as to attend me today."<eos> Do you think Elizabeth could ever be persuaded to meet me here?<eos> Even for half an hour?
That the customs officials at St Ann's are determined to let nothing slip ashore.<eos> That all your attempts to persuade them with a share of the profits have fallen on deaf ears.<eos> And now this crackdown from on high means that every time we find a new landing place, we're met by gaugers and military.<eos> All cargo confiscated crew barely 'scaped with their lives.<eos> So here's the thing, we've run out of navigable inlets.<eos> And I possess the only one for miles.<eos> Actually, I expect to be seeing a good deal of Ross in future.<eos> I've increased my shareholding in his mine.<eos> So I hope I won't have cause to inflict undue pressure on him.<eos> Or on Francis, for that matter.
And we don't yet know if there's ore enough to make it worthwhile.<eos> Is it worth the risk?<eos> We have these samples, this map, Mark's word.<eos> Your pigheadness!<eos> And against that?<eos> Time?<eos> Money?<eos> Common sense?<eos> Is it a secret or can we all be told?<eos> All in good time.
One can gamble on a man as well as a mine.<eos> Well, I can't guarantee the mine.<eos> Well, if that's how you feel, let's shake hands on it.<eos> Ross, before you take this forward, there are certain things I should tell you.<eos> Past things?<eos> And I shouldn't feel I could... proceed unless you were fully apprised of...<eos> If it's the past, let's forget it.<eos> I don't think I want to hear it.<eos> If that's the case, I don't think I want to hear it myself!<eos> To the Poldarks.

That's awesome.<eos> Car, find Artificial Brain.<eos> After this song.<eos> We didn't hit our first hiccup until Virginia.<eos> - But it was kind of a doozy.<eos> - Hey, that was a good song.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've been thinking about Senator Morra.<eos> The shooting.
Why would he lie?<eos> Why would he be trying to get on death row?<eos> And how could he lie so well?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> Well, in the meantime, we have a lot of work to do here at the CJC, where we're all employed, so...<eos> She's still looking into Senator Morra?<eos> I guess whatever I said in Virginia wasn't good enough, which means I need to do better.<eos> Fast.<eos> You want what, mate?<eos> Soda pop.
You're gonna punch me in the face later, aren't you?<eos> That pill does make you quicker.<eos> I can't come to the phone right now, but if this is an emergency, you can try Rebecca Harris any time, day or night.<eos> 917-555-0163.<eos> Brian, I told you to change that message.<eos> And charge your phone.<eos> Naz needs everybody in here.<eos> Special Agent Rebecca Harris.<eos> Nope.<eos> No way.
I think.<eos> Sorry about the wrapping.<eos> Oh, no, the wrapping is my favorite part.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a pillow.<eos> For napping.<eos> Anywhere you want.<eos> Like, if you get called in on a midnight kidnapping case, for example, then you can sleep...<eos> Through it?<eos> Nah, just the boring parts.
Thank you.<eos> Brian.<eos> I take it you've been trying to reach me.<eos> Sands, listen to me, I don't have much time...<eos> Relax, Brian.<eos> I'm not trying to threaten or encroach in any other way upon Rebecca.<eos> Since you have failed utterly to convince her to stop asking questions, I've simply stepped in to smooth things over.<eos> How are you doing that?<eos> By offering her a job.<eos> Quite an attractive one, in fact.
But it turned out to be worth it, since that way I was able to meet Sergei, The Blue Limit's man in charge on the ground, and he had issues of his own he needed help with.<eos> You know, it sounds to me like your nephew's just trying to get your brother's attention.<eos> Cry for help?<eos> Exactly, that's exactly right.<eos> I mean, think of it like this, Sergei.<eos> You put a kid like that on a Ducati, he's just gonna ride around knocking driver side mirrors off to get a rise out of Dad.<eos> But if Dad takes away the Ducati and actually listens to him...<eos> I'm sure he has not thought of it quite this way.<eos> Well, he totally should.<eos> Nostrovia.

It's you.<eos> I guess.<eos> That's him.<eos> Yup.<eos> Do you want to call for backup?<eos> For what?<eos> We don't have enough to arrest him.<eos> Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What if you can't scare him into a deal?<eos> You should go back to the CJC, Finch.<eos> No, no way, not now.
I mean, I couldn't figure out why anyone would target them.<eos> But the basement tenant is the United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing.<eos> Oh, I know that location.<eos> It's where banks send soiled and defaced bills.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The Department of Mutilated Money.<eos> And the New York office handles the entire northeast.<eos> I mean, do you know how much cash they must have in there?<eos> Yeah, but it's unusable currency, waiting to be destroyed.<eos> Not all of it.
One dollar says we will find evidence of alien life in our lifetime.<eos> And one dollar says we won't.<eos> I believe you owe Dr. Marshall a dollar, Dr. Reid.<eos> What is this?<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> You two have kind of a friendly rivalry.<eos> Ish.<eos> Just a couple of eminent astrophysicists debating whether or not we discover evidence of extraterrestrial life within the next couple of decades.<eos> You even made a bet about it, didn't you?<eos> For one dollar.
Well, we know he traveled to Moscow on the, um... fake passport you gave him.<eos> I'll leave that part out, thanks.<eos> Well, we don't know if that was his final destination, and we don't have the authority to do a damn thing on Russian soil.<eos> So the, uh, Diplomatic Security Service, they're working it hard.<eos> The CIA has their assets keeping their ears open, and NSA, they've cast a...<eos> In other words, - nothing new. - No.<eos> Naz.<eos> Are you gonna tell them?<eos> On your call, are you gonna tell them that Brian brought two pills with him?<eos> To Russia?
Mr. Finch, I...<eos> Where is my son?<eos> !<eos> What the hell have you people done to him?<eos> And why in God's name should I, or anyone else in my family, help you in this case of yours... absent a guarantee of his safe return?<eos> Can you provide that guarantee?<eos> No.<eos> I think maybe we should do this another time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Another time.
You started running there after Naz put the new rules in place, and you realized that if you sprinted ahead of your tail, you'd have a minute or two, maybe, where they wouldn't have their eyes on you.<eos> So you found a hiding spot.<eos> Not far off the path.<eos> Under a bush?<eos> No...<eos> Under a moderately-sized rock.<eos> Right?<eos> It's not fair.<eos> You.<eos> On NZT.
Clearly you guys know what you're doing.<eos> I'm gonna get a cup of decaf.<eos> - Rebecca? - Mm.<eos> What are you all working on?<eos> Leads.<eos> It's a case Cyber asked me<eos> - to look in on. - What happened?<eos> You bleeding?<eos> Oh, no, I just spilled something.<eos> - On your shoulder?
Attempting to link it to your poor home security?<eos> You don't have anything to hold me.<eos> Well, we do have a testimony from your old pal Huston.<eos> It's a crazy story.<eos> He says hi, by the way.<eos> Meantime?<eos> You're gonna tell us where you've keeping Piper Baird.<eos> I have no idea who that is, mate.<eos> What about Conrad Harris?<eos> My father.
Well, maybe you figured it out yourself.<eos> And we did perform some minor miracles today.<eos> We talked to the nearly dead.<eos> We took down an ex-MI6.<eos> Not too shabby.<eos> Anything else you want to knock off your bucket list real quick?<eos> Naz is waiting for me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, um... before we go in there, I just want to say thank you.<eos> For everything.
Is my daughter safe?<eos> She's just fine.<eos> As long as you do your job, she'll stay that way.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> As long as you promise to keep Amelia safe, I'm ready.<eos> Good.<eos> Just to make sure there's no mistakes.<eos> Like I don't know the guy?<eos> I need to hear you say it, mate.<eos> By this time tomorrow,
All right, I'll go with you.<eos> I need to call my wife, let her know about this.<eos> Huh. Elevated heart rate.<eos> Sweating.<eos> Frequent blinking.<eos> I, uh...<eos> Rebecca!<eos> - Rebecca!<eos> Re...<eos> - Sir! For country!
No, not all of them, but... you're more mature emotionally and morally than just about anyone I know.<eos> You're a hero, on or off the pill.<eos> You.<eos> I don't really feel like a hero right now.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> But if ever it isn't...<eos> I'll be here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - For everything.
My husband is starving!<eos> Mmm.<eos> Early pizza. Mmm.<eos> Homer Simpson, your wife is here with your lunch.<eos> Finally!<eos> Well, better make the office a little more Marge-friendly.<eos> See you soon, Liz-Liz.<eos> Oh, honey, you're a lifesaver.<eos> And what a treat to have my wife here.<eos> At the office.
Guys, this is excellent.<eos> I got a lot of that.<eos> If I had a dollar for every sperm, my room would be covered in dollar bills.<eos> - Nick, a word, please.<eos> A word. - Right?<eos> Right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah. - A word.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for the popcorn, too.
I got a lot of that.<eos> If I had a dollar for every sperm, my room would be covered in dollar bills.<eos> - Nick, a word, please.<eos> A word. - Right?<eos> Right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah. - A word.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for the popcorn, too.<eos> One minute.
Aren't you supposed to let the people decide?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Tell you what, there's a town-hall meeting tonight where anybody can bring up new business.<eos> - Why don't you give it a shot there?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Now, I can't imagine a free people ever voting to send an army into an open-ended foreign conflict which profits only the few.<eos> That would be madness.<eos> Well, s-sure.<eos> But you're forgetting one thing.<eos> This smile.
? If I were a jolly blacksmith?<eos> No, I'm not feeling it.<eos> Besides, I'd get filthy.<eos> There must be something better.<eos> ? If I were a friendly farmer?<eos> ? Wouldn't that be so sweet?<eos> ? I'd be planting greens and lots of beans?<eos> ? And other things to eat?<eos> ? Then I'd plant some eggs, then a couple pigs?<eos> ? Then a yummy chocolate cake?
I would have done the same thing.<eos> No, you wouldn't have.<eos> I don't know what pisses me off more... they think she's a killer or that they think she's that stupid.<eos> Yeah, if she did take out Carter, why would she ask me to look into his disappearance?<eos> How does that make any sense?<eos> What makes a hell of a lot more sense is that guy who threatened you at gunpoint.<eos> Like, maybe if you tell them that...<eos> They threatened Sarah and Sawyer's lives.<eos> Meanwhile, they can get to me, they can get to them.<eos> No, no way.
You know him?<eos> I don't know him.<eos> Should I?<eos> You know her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I, uh, drove down to meet her a few times.<eos> - Where?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Different places.
Find a location.<eos> I completely understand if you don't wanna...<eos> What's the number?<eos> All right.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> I just hope...<eos> I know, hope I'm doing the right thing.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> For what?
Thank you, darling.<eos> I mean, I know this is self-evident, but dying really sucks.<eos> Whoa, trauma, MVA on our doorstep.<eos> - Go, go, go.<eos> - Drink it!<eos> Mm, can't wait.<eos> Got a 35-year-old woman, drunk driver, car versus tree.<eos> B.P. is 160 over 90.<eos> I need two large bore IV's, an arterial line, and a catheter.<eos> On three.
She blew the left vein, too.<eos> Maybe she has an underlying condition.<eos> Is she on any medication?<eos> The only thing I know about this woman is that she works on the eighth floor.<eos> Maybe we should page Dr. Harris?<eos> No! Call up to palliative.<eos> See if the charge nurse knows anything about nurse Fields.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ready?<eos> On three.
Trace amounts of asbestos is found in tap water.<eos> He's careful about everything.<eos> I can see that.<eos> You would be, too, if you were sick all the time.<eos> I'll need a detailed list of everything Mordecai's been taking in case something's contraindicated.<eos> Let's see. There's ciclesonide, pirbuterol for his asthmas, duloxetine for his anxiety, ramelteon for his insomnia, what else?<eos> Methylphenidate. Helps me focus.<eos> That is a lot for a young man to be on.<eos> How long has he been sick?<eos> On and off his whole life.
Uh, so we're giving you a round of antibiotics for infection.<eos> Other than that, you'll be good to go.<eos> What... what about the bullet?<eos> Well, because of where it's settled, there's no medical reason to remove it.<eos> Wait, so you're gonna...<eos> You're gonna leave this thing inside me?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> I know it seems unorthodox, but...<eos> No, he had a gun in my face.<eos> My face.
Lamar said some old dude showed up instead.<eos> You good, Carl?<eos> Who this, your daddy?<eos> Friend.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Oh, so we about to stomp both of y'all out, huh?<eos> Come on, he worked for you a little while.<eos> Now he wants to retire.<eos> Let's just leave it at that.<eos> Retire?
I don't drink.<eos> I hear it makes your skin old and leathery.<eos> - Ooh. - Got you.<eos> That--that's--that's how we're playing this?<eos> Hey, you threw down first.<eos> Where are you from, kid?<eos> Back of the Yards.<eos> A local boy.<eos> What's your story?<eos> Story?
Me too.<eos> Is that one of the skeletons you wanted to tell me about?<eos> I don't remember wanting to tell you.<eos> Hey, I have skeletons of my own too, you know.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Like what?<eos> Hell no.<eos> You first.<eos> How about we say it at the same time?<eos> Count of three.
Henchmaniacs, you know what to do!<eos> This was a bad idea.<eos> Uh, hey, dudes.<eos> Is this thing on? Tes...<eos> Uh, I just wanted you monster dudes to hand over Ford, or we'll have to, like, fight and junk?<eos> Hey, you're a little cutie.<eos> I have butchered millions on countless moons!<eos> Whoa. I liked you better before you talked.<eos> Real... real bring-down, this guy.<eos> Attack!
All right, dudes! Everyone!<eos> Like we planned!<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> Go!<eos> Ha ha ha! Good pig.<eos> Get 'em, Gobblewonker!<eos> Oh, no, you don't!<eos> Everyone! Incoming!<eos> Does this thing have an escape hatch?<eos> Everybody! Maximum power!
Don'tyou? What are you...<eos> Oh. Oh, no.<eos> Perhaps torturing those kids will make you talk!<eos> Not the kids!<eos> You ca...<eos> Lets get this over with.<eos> What the... No!<eos> No!<eos> No! No! No!<eos> Attack!
Preston Northwest had to sell his mansion to preserve his family fortune.<eos> You're only going to have one pony now!<eos> But fortunes have also turned for local maniac Fiddleford McGucket who, after regaining his sanity, has made millions overnight submitting his patents to the US government.<eos> I'm gonna buy me a bigger shed!<eos> Hey, that one's for sale!<eos> In other good news, town hero Stanley Pines has fully recovered his memory and will be throwing a party to celebrate his niece and nephew's thirteenth birthday and final day in town.<eos> But other than that, I can safely say our beloved Gravity Falls is back to normal.<eos> - And now, Bodacious T, with sports.<eos> - It's called Death Ball!<eos> ♪ ...to you ♪
But since that's impossible... Is that impossible?<eos> Since that's probably impossible, my only wish is for everyone to sign my scrapbook.<eos> I'll never forget you guys.<eos> Wait.<eos> Now I'll never forget you guys!<eos> I now officially declare you: technically teenagers.<eos> Welcome to Angst and Acne Forever. One of us!<eos> One of us!<eos> - So how do you feel?<eos> - Samey, but differenty.
To find the right lung for you there'd need to be a major pile-up involving hundreds of non-smoking marathoners.<eos> Just a little rear-end collision.<eos> I think you can give me the pager back.<eos> No.<eos> You do know where you are?<eos> Oh shit!<eos> 453, addendum.<eos> Well, it appears my time has come.<eos> It's cold as hell.<eos> So much for spring.
then we'll end it.<eos> And after our final post, Andi, believe me everyone will know who you are.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> You have to shake on it.<eos> Hello and welcome to Bedboys.de.<eos> - This is Andi.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And I'm Andi.<eos> Um... Again.
"Thanks, Benno.<eos> Good idea, Benno." Say it.<eos> What?<eos> "Thanks, Benno.<eos> Good idea, Benno."<eos> Thanks, Benno.<eos> Good idea, Benno.<eos> - Here you are.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> To the most beautiful day!
You have very nice Dinger.<eos> Goebbels.<eos> Reichsparteitag.<eos> Great!<eos> Great!<eos> Ribbentrop, VW Käfer, Kraft durch Freude.<eos> Autobahn, Eva Hermann, keine Ahnung...<eos> Have you lost it?<eos> Benno...<eos> Help!
Death is our...<eos> Okay. - That was fast.<eos> - They make heroin out of it!<eos> Please no, Benno!<eos> - Stand up.<eos> - No.<eos> Stand up, Andi, and I'll give this back and you can get down.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Upright.
He wants to sell it in Johannesburg, for his family.<eos> For his mum with AIDS and 12 half-orphaned siblings?<eos> - How did you know that? - Oh, Andi!<eos> How naïve can you be! - Andi's day.<eos> - What?<eos> -My gut says he's staying.<eos> -No!<eos> Andi!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Over my dead...
Hey, you guys can't travel under your real names.<eos> Black Claw knows about you and Monroe.<eos> To be safe, you can't go as you.<eos> I know somebody who could get you fake passports.<eos> Better than coming from us.<eos> - So when do we go?<eos> - Tomorrow.<eos> First flight we can get.<eos> What are you gonna tell Adalind?<eos> The truth.
I'll be sure to cry.<eos> Adalind, I think it's time we settle our differences. Violently.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Really?<eos> Are you?<eos> If anyone had said what we did last night was even a possibility, given how we met...<eos> No, I wouldn't have believed them either.<eos> Everything in our lives is so complicated, but last night, that all kind of went away.<eos> At least for a little while.
Oh, I'm glad you're here.<eos> I just got the head of the teacher's union to agree to show up this afternoon.<eos> Well, that's a coup.<eos> Have you seen the news?<eos> Our opponent's little indiscretion has been playing on every channel since the story broke, and we're up four points because of you.<eos> Well, not because of me.<eos> He dug his own grave.<eos> I just provided the shovel.<eos> - And the dirt.<eos> - Well, that too.
I don't want it to look like I'm trying to hog the limelight.<eos> You aren't.<eos> Standing side by side with Dixon gives people confidence, and that gives us votes.<eos> By the way, here's a few points we'd like to include in your intro.<eos> Guess I better read this.<eos> Yeah, you better.<eos> Hey, Rachel, can you come take a look at this?<eos> I think they're putting the banners in the wrong place.<eos> No, no, no, not there.<eos> The other side.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe there's other commandments we know nothing about.<eos> Look at this turnout!<eos> This is what I'm talking about, Portland!<eos> This is the kind of support that will help make this city great.<eos> So on election day, tell your friends.<eos> Tell your coworkers.<eos> Tell anyone who loves this city to get out there and vote for Andrew Dixon.<eos> Let's make our voices heard!<eos> Just a sec.
Bottom line, it keeps her safe and out of prison.<eos> And frankly... it's much better<eos> Get it done.<eos> Hand the phone to laurel.<eos> Ms. Hitchin.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay, laurel, we have a deal.<eos> Once you've made a public announcement, I'll drop the director somewhere safe.<eos> Mmm, no.<eos> Uh, just a sec.
Oh, I love this.<eos> Is this Latin American cotton?<eos> I went to El Salvador last year on this ridiculous surf trip.<eos> Cool.<eos> So good.<eos> Another scarf?<eos> I didn't agree to move in with Steven Tyler's mike stand.<eos> Mm. Mm.<eos> Guys, I think I'm gonna hit up an earlier yoga class.<eos> Oh, at that place?
Seriously?<eos> Seriously?<eos> ! Not your moment, Brad.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> No-no-no.<eos> I-I...<eos> We did not hook up. Oh?<eos> Okay, I did, but... just give me one minute to explain.<eos> Which part?
- But?<eos> I could use a weird friend.<eos> Do they come any weirder? (chuckles)<eos> Breakfast burritos are so good.<eos> They should make dinner burritos.<eos> That's a billion-dollar idea,<eos> Brad, it's called burritos.<eos> I was realizing that as I said it.<eos> Well, thanks for taking me out, guys.<eos> Third day in a row.
I'm just glad you're not one of the crazies.<eos> (laughs) Yeah, right?<eos> No, I was a...<eos> I was a casual New Kids fan, not one of the crazy ones, you know, Joey Mclntyre.<eos> Can you... not use my full name?<eos> Oh, you got it, Joey. (mouths)<eos> Uh, okay, so tell me about this girl, Kelly.<eos> How old is she, what disease does she have?<eos> She's 32, and she tested positive for being super mad at me, and the doctors prescribed a round of J-Mac Z-Pak.<eos> Candy corn.

He's worse.<eos> Much worse.<eos> Wait a second, worse than a snake?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I thought we'd seen it all.<eos> Don't talk about things you don't understand, mr. Gecko.<eos> You're right. I don't understand, because Alonzo here flashed his fangs at us last night.<eos> Now you're telling me he's not one of you?<eos> He's been transformed.<eos> Into what?
Sorry, old man.<eos> Ok, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Your soul speaks.<eos> We have a new operator in town,<eos> Skull keeper: Your mind dies...<eos> And I think he's trying to take over this outfit,<eos> Like a... Tapeworm in our gut.<eos> Well, hawkeye and trapper john aren't around, So I am here to perform a minor procedure.<eos> You see, once our guy gets a hold of you, He leaves you in a state of, uh...<eos> Perpetual britney.
Ah, George, there you are!<eos> - Sir.<eos> - I need you to come with me.<eos> The girl, Fen, she's likely to flee from the light of the torches.<eos> But then, sir, how will we see?<eos> - With these.<eos> - Good gracious!<eos> Now, George, if you were trying to get away, which direction would you be likely to go in?<eos> - Sir, I would follow the river.<eos> - Exactly.
- Who is it?<eos> - A Hugo de Jaager.<eos> Left his family home in Peterborough for Toronto a week ago.<eos> Hasn't been heard from since.<eos> - What's all this?<eos> - Sir, this is his research.<eos> He told his mother before he left he was sure he was going to find her this time.<eos> - "Her"?<eos> - The girl, sir.<eos> The feral girl.
- I need you.<eos> I've already left.<eos> I'm in a cab...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Raymond, forget the girl.<eos> Leave her and get over here.<eos> OK.<eos> - I have to go back.<eos> - To the party?<eos> - To the office.
Since the Bonn incident, we no longer want anyone to suspect us of spying on our pals.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> We no longer recruit within our allies.<eos> And you no longer wire-tap them?<eos> You can't expect us to cut our ears off, now can you?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Do you have any idea how many guys come to us with a proposal?<eos> I mean, allied guys.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> 17 a day.
What's his goal?<eos> It's a test.<eos> I think I know what he's after. They have a mole here.<eos> He wants to know if we know, and what we'd do if we did...<eos> We've learned one thing: They don't know that we know.<eos> That we know what?<eos> During Cyclone's captivity, there were leaks on Felis.<eos> We know... and we're watching.<eos> Watching who?<eos> Everyone.
I understand.<eos> I want compensation.<eos> How does it work?<eos> Shapur's father hears us out.<eos> If he believes I've been assaulted, his son will have to pay and apologize.<eos> It's on Saturday.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll be your witness.<eos> He's here.<eos> The whole bottle!
You'll regret it!<eos> Enough.<eos> Bitch!<eos> Are you dropping me at the bus stop?<eos> Or do we walk in together?<eos> The bus stop's better.<eos> We could always say we're carpooling.<eos> Yeah...<eos> I like carpooling.<eos> One for the road?
The Algerians warned the CIA.<eos> According to the report.<eos> But I disagree.<eos> It's a credible theory.<eos> Cassidy's attitude is fishy.<eos> Let me sniff around.<eos> The Americans don't need a mole within our ranks.<eos> They already listen in on us.<eos> I don't mean a mole.<eos> More like leaks, negligence, collusion.
30 years ago, I found the book of the dead.<eos> Now because I read from the book...<eos> Misartar.<eos> Evil has found me.<eos> All roads to destroying this evil lead to wear it all began.<eos> The cabin.

This is what's up.<eos> Washing dishes with eggs and mayonnaise, wearing a damn hairnet.<eos> I got my check from my boss.<eos> I thought he was playing a joke.<eos> And if you didn't want me when I had cash, how am I supposed to get with you now?<eos> That whole wannabe gangster act, you were trying too hard.<eos> But what you just said?<eos> That was real.<eos> Put the hairnet back on.<eos> No way.
Said his name was Andy, but who knows?<eos> Don't worry about him.<eos> He's dead.<eos> What happened?<eos> Mandy, what happened?<eos> I've got blood on this dress.<eos> I've worn this, like, twice.<eos> Mandy!<eos> I met him through my service.<eos> What service?
You're okay.<eos> And you're surprised by that?<eos> Relieved.<eos> 'Cause instead of sleeping it off, I got a ride in an ambulance and an IV bag full of salt water.<eos> You know what the hospital charges for that?<eos> Two grand.<eos> All right?<eos> So congratulations.<eos> You got me back.<eos> Um, for what?
Oh.<eos> You got a girl in your room?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She only brought one.<eos> Only one, huh?<eos> Well... there you go, two.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Is that his first time?<eos> Who knows?<eos> To Carl.
Oh, the timing's a little weird.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> They're all watching.<eos> On the other hand, now... I did go to the store, bought this, make a big entrance, so if I was gonna propose, this would be kind of hard to top, don't you think?<eos> I'm gonna do it.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Stop!<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> - You're not serious.<eos> Hundred percent.
Uh...<eos> Yeah, I mean, I guess... guess we could do that.<eos> Okay, dark.<eos> - Well, it's not an X.<eos> - What's not an X?<eos> I can't tell what you're looking at.<eos> Oh, my God, that better be your hand.<eos> Look at those skulls.<eos> Seven of 'em.<eos> Kind of a circle.
Look, Ma, Holly and I got a lot to do today.<eos> As soon as Tasha brings the checks over, I'll bring them by, okay?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I'm not worried about it, 'cause I'm not leaving until I get them.<eos> Besides, I want to get to know Haley... - Holly.<eos> - Holly, right.<eos> See?<eos> We need to get to know each other better.<eos> For you, son.<eos> For the game tonight?
An unexpected development has presented itself, one that I must seize.<eos> Pretty soon, I will be able to spread my wings again.<eos> But before that happens, I need your help opening the cage.<eos> So listen carefully.<eos> I have a job for you.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'll make sure all the parties are notified. Thanks.<eos> Valdes, I need you to get this paperwork started.<eos> Transfer papers for Ruiz?<eos> No, Felipe Lobos.
Who did you say I was?<eos> I told her I saw an old guy at the window.<eos> Merry Christmas, Grant!<eos> Mom and Dad are asleep now.<eos> I can get you back on the roof.<eos> I know the way.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Take a look at that picture.<eos> - Ok.<eos> - Now this one.
- Leaving, I suppose, the field open for you to move in...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ...and care for the child she'd had by another man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So she could keep working and possibly date other friends of yours.<eos> - Pretty much.<eos> - You tiger.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Who are you thanking?<eos> The universe.
- You tiger.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Who are you thanking?<eos> The universe.<eos> There's somebody worse at this than me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> This is Mr. Huffle.<eos> Mr. Huffle feels pain.<eos> Meet me in the kitchen.<eos> With you in a minute.
I've lost count.<eos> Not one of them has succeeded, not a single one.<eos> They all lost and burned and ran.<eos> That's who I am.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a burger.<eos> I always bring a snack.<eos> But I don't want it now, he's put me off my dinner.<eos> Very good.<eos> Right on target.
I know, it's terrible.<eos> Sorry, I'm doing everything I can to stop me. - See that?<eos> - It's a signal, isn't it?<eos> It's a signal beaming into space.<eos> There was one from the New York office too.<eos> There's something in low orbit.<eos> - I did book a restaurant.<eos> - I'm not comfortable in restaurants.<eos> I suppose you get a lot of stares, dressed like that.<eos> Right back at you.
- Oh, you'll be fine!<eos> The ship will have blown up long before you've been strangled to death!<eos> - And what's plan B? !<eos> - I have no idea, but it's going to be a very big relief when I think of it.<eos> You are completely out of your mind!<eos> How is that news to anyone?<eos> I know you miss her, but couldn't you just write a poem?<eos> Excellent! The controls are locked, but they've still got a little bit of give.<eos> It means I can take aim.<eos> - At what? !

And look, there's UNIT, on the way to close your head office.<eos> It's almost like they've been tipped off.<eos> The vengeance of Harmony Shoal is known and feared - throughout the five star systems!<eos> - Is it?<eos> Is it really?<eos> Well, I'd like to stick around and listen, but it's been a very long night.<eos> Also, someone needs changing.<eos> You're not the only one that's full of it.<eos> Let's go, let's go, let's go!<eos> - Down here now!
- Agents?<eos> - CIA.<eos> That's what you guys are.<eos> I can tell. Special activities division, black bag operations, wet work, whatever the fuck.<eos> What do you think, he's some kind of squatter?<eos> Oh, you gonna talk about me like I'm not even here?<eos> That's not very good tradecraft.<eos> Stop.<eos> Someone's been in here, and they've been using this place like a prison.<eos> Like a prison.
We're familia!<eos> We're culebras!<eos> There are smart culebras... and dead culebras.<eos> To Itzpa! [sighs]<eos> Itzpa serves Amaru.<eos> She is her majesty's soul gatherer, and by serving her, we'll be granted a place in Xibalba when it comes.<eos> And you are a sacrifice for Amaru.<eos> [onlookers] Itzpa.<eos> Itzpa.<eos> To Xibalba!

Whoa, whoa. Easy, fellas.<eos> Ol' Burt's got everything we need to perform... a good old-fashioned exorcism.<eos> What? Bongs full of holy water?<eos> No. No, nothing that tired.<eos> The ancient Ritual de los Bacabs.<eos> And if we do it right, we might just cast away the soul of Amaru and save Katey-Kakes. Forever.<eos> Will it hurt her?<eos> Well... we'll have to keep an eye on that.<eos> No.<eos> No way.
[Richie] Scott!<eos> Scott!<eos> - What did this to you?<eos> - Same thing that did that to him.<eos> Fuck did you do now? - I didn't do anything.<eos> - Yeah, somehow I don't believe that.<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> This is on you, Gecko.<eos> Who knows what kinda... beast you've brought here.<eos> - Oh, shit.
You said he was the slave master.<eos> Where are the slaves?<eos> Shit.<eos> They were all in here.<eos> (sighs) She's already taken them.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> If she made these slaves, then she's gonna... try to open it.<eos> Open what?<eos> The door.<eos> To Xibalba.
You are not gonna believe it.<eos> - You get the coordinates I sent you?<eos> - I did.<eos> Thanks for doin' this.<eos> Ain't done it yet.<eos> Need some deets, Fred.<eos> Need to know exactly why you're making me come down here in the middle of the night.<eos> I told you.<eos> The Zetas are moving product through that ranch.<eos> Product.
You haven't done your job.<eos> I just brought you a giant fucking prize.<eos> And you think that's enough for a free ticket to paradise?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Very bold choice.<eos> Makes me question where your loyalties lie now.<eos> Where do you think?<eos> You know, the way I see it... you gotta find something worth fighting for in this life.<eos> And I have.<eos> Me.
That, uh, girlfriend of yours, you used to feed on her, without turning her, right?<eos> Well, way I see it, we're at war with General Whatever-the-fuck, right?<eos> Consider it rations.<eos> - How about is in there?<eos> - Bad. And gettin' worse.<eos> What?<eos> She needed to feed.<eos> Smart.<eos> You know, I haven't healed yet.<eos> Not a chance.
Matanzas.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I know it. Why didn't you tell us?<eos> It didn't occur to me.<eos> What does it matter?<eos> Now we know.<eos> [chains clanking] [Venganza] Let me go!<eos> - What the fuck are you doing?<eos> - If it's all the same to you... I'll be taking Lord Venganza to the ceremony.<eos> What ceremony?
Not everything is an impulse.<eos> Some things are.<eos> Ah, crap on a cracker.<eos> I meant to bring the harpoon gun. Ah!<eos> Another genius move from the alleged expert.<eos> If it weren't for me you'd still be running around upstairs like a decapitated chicken.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm not the one that brought a stick to a harpoon fight.<eos> - Holy fuck! - Shh!<eos> We're close.<eos> Guys!
I used to do magic tricks. For the guys in the yard.<eos> I should have been an escape artist.<eos> That's how I got here, right?<eos> That's how you got here.<eos> Was your last trick making your wife disappear?<eos> I never touched her, man.<eos> I'm innocent.<eos> Hey, get away from me, man.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Little bit.
How can you not know this is wrong?<eos> You are a man of order, a man of law.<eos> You're wasting your breath.<eos> She has my family.<eos> She destroyed mine.<eos> My brothers and sisters, all of them.
You're wasting your breath.<eos> She has my family.<eos> She destroyed mine.<eos> My brothers and sisters, all of them.<eos> I can't order you, Peacekeeper, but I can ask you...<eos> Just kill me. Stake me.<eos> Burn me.<eos> But don't bring me to her.<eos> Xibalbans have always tortured culebras with the sun.<eos> For punishment.
It's begun.<eos> What's begun?<eos> A new age.<eos> _<eos> Do you know how long she's waited for this?<eos> Now she walks in her own skin, Queen of the Underworld.<eos> Soon to be the Queen of our world.<eos> Tlalticpac, the realm of light, will be consumed by the realm of shadows.<eos> All she has to do... is let it in.<eos> Oh, man.
I know.<eos> Oh, believe me, I know.<eos> You're all gonna save the world.<eos> Well, it's too late.<eos> This is the end.<eos> I am the end.<eos> And the girl... is dead.<eos> Kate?<eos> Welcome home, Richard.<eos> And welcome to slavery.
Nice.<eos> His overalls.<eos> Overalls?<eos> Nice.<eos> So he... he's a farmer?<eos> She decided the only way to truly defeat the vermin was to drop off the grid completely.<eos> That's true.<eos> I moved into the campground and bathed in the river, cooked on a portable stove.<eos> I'd like to have seen that.<eos> Not the... well, the stove part.
Sorry, not an astrophysicist, but can't the Russians just bring the Americans extra space suits?<eos> Uh, well, yes and no.<eos> But... but mostly no.<eos> That would require a space walk outside the station, to then pass E.M.U.'s through an air lock to our guys, and, unfortunately, the suits are too bulky to be placed in the air lock.<eos> This is where the secretary comes in.<eos> The Russians, in their wisdom, are planning to send up an unmanned Soyuz rescue capsule.<eos> They've been developing a new modular E.M.U. suit.<eos> Yeah, these are suits that could be taken apart and then handed piece by piece through the air lock here at the end of Kibo Lab.<eos> Let me guess: Russians don't actually have the suits yet.<eos> A tragically excellent guess.
Good night.<eos> Well, so much for kindness even in their grief.<eos> Zelinski is holed up in a farmhouse.<eos> Delta is closing in.<eos> Any casualties?<eos> Two wounded so far, no fatalities as yet.<eos> Okay.<eos> Nadine says Chen agreed.<eos> Space suits will be en route to the Soyuz base within the hour.<eos> Oh, just in time.
"The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what he did here."<eos> May he rest in peace.<eos> Russian cosmonauts undertook an amazing nine consecutive space walks to save their American and Japanese colleagues aboard the International Space Station.<eos> We did it.<eos> Well, actually, the secretary did it.<eos> No, they did it.<eos> No, I mean... we all did it.<eos> Russia, China and the U.S.?<eos> I mean, how often does that happen?<eos> Cheers.

Nothing suspicious about Lobos going missing on the exact day you happen to be out of town.<eos> Tommy, you listening?<eos> Angela will believe me.<eos> You're so fucking sure about that.<eos> One second.<eos> What's up, Tasha?<eos> You good?<eos> What's up? I'm good. And where the hell is Holly?<eos> I've been texting your girl all morning.<eos> What the...
One second.<eos> What's up, Tasha?<eos> You good?<eos> What's up? I'm good. And where the hell is Holly?<eos> I've been texting your girl all morning.<eos> What the...<eos> Hey, T.<eos> I thought you two weren't talking.<eos> We worked some shit out.<eos> Mm-hmm. Overnight.
So's this. Did you really think that I didn't know that you was just gonna drop me when this was all over?<eos> Seriously, bitch, ain't you got a job?<eos> "Love you, Angie."<eos> Yes, hello.<eos> I need a shoeshine for my husband.<eos> He's sleeping.<eos> I'd like it back in about 20 minutes, before he wakes up.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Damn it, Ghost.<eos> Out.
What about her?<eos> Come on, Ghost. We ain't there yet.<eos> Mm, what do you think?<eos> I organized my escape.<eos> I know every detail of the government's plan to move me.<eos> Yeah, we know you got a fucking rat on the inside.<eos> Mm-hmm, and when my "rat" on the inside realizes that I haven't made it to my destination, he's gonna get Angela's beautiful brown eyes, you know?<eos> He's gonna come out, and he's gonna scoop them out and fuck it.<eos> - No, are you serious?<eos> Mm-mm.
You took two to the chest, and you refuse to go to the hospital.<eos> He's gonna look you over.<eos> That's an order.<eos> I'm gonna need you to unbutton your shirt.<eos> - What?<eos> - Unbutton your shirt, please.<eos> Fuck.<eos> After I got popped, they went straight...<eos> Deep breath, please.<eos> Deep breath again.
Fuck.<eos> After I got popped, they went straight...<eos> Deep breath, please.<eos> Deep breath again.<eos> After I got popped, they went straight for Lobos's GPS tracker, rolled up with fucking bolt cutters, ready for it, which means we've got a big fucking leak.<eos> GPS trackers are standard operating procedure with high-value prisoners.<eos> They were likely prepared for it just in case.<eos> Right, Mike, they... but they knew exactly what van to hit, what route... stop, man...<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> - What time.
Uh, shut up.<eos> Like I said, we were all spooked, but Valdes was practically crying like a... human woman.<eos> For effect. Mm, looked pretty real to me.<eos> You guys back in the sack?<eos> No.<eos> Well, then, now that you're wounded, I'm thinking you might be able to get back in there.<eos> Like a Purple Heart, but you know, pussy.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Dean, thanks for coming in.<eos> Pleasure.
Give her your dagger.<eos> No, no, I can't do that.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You can.<eos> You have to try.<eos> Ready?<eos> Now!<eos> I guess I'm not used to all that excitement.<eos> I'm Hercules.<eos> Megara.
You're... you're the boy that tried to save me.<eos> "Tried"?<eos> I'm afraid Cerberus got me... right after he got you.<eos> Run.<eos> Run.<eos> No, he'll kill you.<eos> I don't care now.<eos> Go.<eos> I'm so sorry, Meg, I...<eos> What for?
I, uh, saved his leg, and he kills my liver.<eos> Macrury 25...<eos> that must've been some leg.<eos> Alex, you want in?<eos> Mm, think I'll stick with my wine, but, uh, I'll raise a glass.<eos> Slàinte mhath... to your good health.<eos> We should be drinking to yours.<eos> Surgery's next week?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tuesday.
All right.<eos> Other voices disappear... until you only hear your own.<eos> And when you start to listen to it?<eos> Touch.<eos> Touch.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You become capable of anything.<eos> We can draw him out.<eos> He'll take the risk.<eos> _
You have a dog at home?<eos> My mom says they poop and then sit on your couch.<eos> Your mom's right about that.<eos> But I want one.<eos> Someday.<eos> Hey, you want to give him a treat?<eos> I got some in my, uh, truck over there.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Ah, thanks.<eos> _
Close the perimeter.<eos> No one goes in or out.<eos> You all right?<eos> Uh, I think he's sick or something.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something's going on with him.<eos> - Did you see him?<eos> - We're gonna need paramedics.<eos> What was he wearing?<eos> A blue jacket.
White male, 30s, blue jacket, brown hair, alone.<eos> Suspect has acne scars on his face.<eos> No one who fits that description leaves this mall.<eos> What else?<eos> Hair still Brown?<eos> Longer, I think.<eos> Was he alone?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Think, Adam.<eos> Which way?
- We just...<eos> - The guy in custody.<eos> That's what you sold us.<eos> We detained a few people matching the description.<eos> So, no?<eos> There's hours of security footage to review, witnesses to talk to...<eos> I put my son through this whole thing...<eos> He was there.<eos> These people sometimes know the family... be good if one of you could come and look through footage, see if you recognize anyone...<eos> even from years ago.
Anything else I can help you with?<eos> Thanks for coming down.<eos> People are boring, aren't they?<eos> Sheep with smartphones.<eos> There's no one I know in this mall.<eos> We got his jacket, John.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> That's...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
It'll be here somewhere, okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Well, we'll find it.<eos> Okay?<eos> All right.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Uh, where is it?<eos> _
Okay, precinct totals have been reported and...<eos> Oh, just hang up on her.<eos> Wait, where is Catherine?<eos> She should be getting this for her little movie.<eos> I'm feeling light-headed.<eos> That bottle's my only source of blood sugar.<eos> Okay, Gary, I'm wanna get Charlie Baird in for another meeting.<eos> You want me to invite some other people?<eos> - No, no, no, just him. - Oh.<eos> - Just him?
- Mike, Mike!<eos> - Deb.<eos> Can we expect a stimulus package?<eos> Yes, right now all options are on the table.<eos> Uh, including a stimulus package, uh, which is on the table.<eos> - Mike!<eos> - Wayne.<eos> Why did the president bring Charlie Baird in again today after he met with the O'Brien camp?<eos> Uh, Charlie Baird, uh... he's just... came in for a meeting.<eos> Just a meeting.
Uh, yeah.<eos> - Cool, let's go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Let's go! (SNAPS FINGERS)<eos> - Yeah.<eos> GARY: And this is my number and it goes straight to me.<eos> You can call me any time of the day.<eos> I'm always here.<eos> - Thank you, Birmingham.<eos> - Okay.
- I went down the street to Smart Vinyl.<eos> 12.95.<eos> You spent 12.95 on Earl's record, but you wouldn't lend me 25Â¢ for a latte yesterday?<eos> Look, we gotta do something about Earl.<eos> He deserves to play at that jazz club.<eos> I mean, he is the only one at this diner who has a chance to make it.<eos> I appreciate your enthusiasm, but of all of us here, you think the 80-year-old has the brightest future?<eos> For as long as I've known Earl, all he talked about is how proud he was of that band.<eos> And that Ruby woman is denying him the chance to play again?<eos> Not on my watch.
Your Ear... Well, I prefer not to go to jail for murdering Earl's girlfriend, but... it's not that strong a preference.<eos> Here, hold my hoops!<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> Max isn't Earl's girlfriend.<eos> He's more like a father-figure to her.<eos> More like a great-grandfather figure!<eos> He's both!<eos> Hold my hoops!<eos> Everybody calm down, take a beat.<eos> A jazzy beat, of course.
- Mr. Collins.<eos> - This is for you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm not a scientist.<eos> I can't say I understand it.<eos> But, what I can tell you is we don't get a weather warning like this every day.<eos> We don't get one every month, either.<eos> In fact, I've never heard of us getting one at all.<eos> Does the name Donora mean anything to you?<eos> Donora?
- They've been notified.<eos> - I want to go to the hospital.<eos> There is an emergency meeting at the House. A meeting you must attend.<eos> The House can wait.<eos> - You wished to see me, Your Majesty?<eos> - Yes, Tommy.<eos> I know how much my father depended on you.<eos> And how closely you worked together.<eos> Which is why I wanted to ask your advice.<eos> Now...
And I do read the newspapers, and I do listen to the wireless, and the situation we're in today is quite different, than the one we were in when Mr. Eden came to see your father.<eos> Different situation, different sovereign.<eos> Wait for me here.<eos> Sir.<eos> Just a child.<eos> A beautiful child.<eos> I just received word from Buckingham Palace.<eos> - The Queen has requested an audience.<eos> - When?<eos> At your earliest convenience.
- But it could easily be arranged.<eos> - Then do it.<eos> And tell the Queen I'll be there first thing in the morning.<eos> After the papers.<eos> Good God.<eos> Dear God.<eos> Just come on in, the Prime Minister will be here in a few moments.<eos> - They're ready for you, sir.<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> One moment.
She told Zach to talk to Travis and Jordan.<eos> - No last names? - Mmm.<eos> Travis and Jordan...<eos> There's a few of each, but, uh, maybe Travis Barstow and Jordan Massina?<eos> They're both on the wrestling team.<eos> Zach's the equipment manager.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> She told Zach Foster to ask you about extra credit.<eos> Zach?<eos> No way.
He said there was a Viking, some kind of sculpture in the parking lot.<eos> He said that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I never saw it, but that's what he said.<eos> If it helps.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So have you seen this boy in the last few days?<eos> He looks kind of familiar, I guess.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What about him?
- How about you get the hell away...<eos> Boom.<eos> I'll be in, I'll be out.<eos> These sessions shouldn't take all that long.<eos> But before we start, Doctor, I was assigned your case, and if you would prefer a female therapist, I would be totally comfortable with that.<eos> Oh, because it was a man who attacked me?<eos> Yeah. And it's important that you feel that you're with the right person, that you feel comfortable, that you get what you need.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> I'm fine. I just need a tape-and-glue guy.<eos> Tape and glue?
She is a Foster care advocate not a social worker or a cop, so you can trust her.<eos> Hey, Jack.<eos> So Callie told me what's been happening in your group home, and I'd like to help you if you want me to.<eos> Are they beating you up?<eos> Show her.<eos> They are in serious violation of their license.<eos> They could potentially get shut down.<eos> But at the very least, I can get you out of there.<eos> Then where will I go?<eos> Someplace safe.
I'm not afraid of this, that I don't... I'm...<eos> - I...<eos> - You're not going to lose me.<eos> And what's beautiful about you is so much more than your body.<eos> It's your heart and soul.<eos> Your mind.<eos> Your laugh.<eos> Your... your courage and your compassion.<eos> Honey, I love this life that we've built together.<eos> Our kids.
- I...<eos> - You're not going to lose me.<eos> And what's beautiful about you is so much more than your body.<eos> It's your heart and soul.<eos> Your mind.<eos> Your laugh.<eos> Your... your courage and your compassion.<eos> Honey, I love this life that we've built together.<eos> Our kids.<eos> Our family.
You knocked that lady down.<eos> That's assault.<eos> One crack pipe with residue.<eos> Other side.<eos> That's the ball game.<eos> Nice.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You're getting up.<eos> Get on your knees first.<eos> On your knees.
That's assault.<eos> One crack pipe with residue.<eos> Other side.<eos> That's the ball game.<eos> Nice.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You're getting up.<eos> Get on your knees first.<eos> On your knees.<eos> On your feet.
Get on your knees first.<eos> On your knees.<eos> On your feet.<eos> Let's go.<eos> That was fast, Detectives.<eos> Job came over the air not five minutes ago.<eos> We were out to meal three blocks over.<eos> Didn't even get a chance to order.<eos> Yeah, lucky us.<eos> Son of a bitch.
I'm not seeing any shell casings or surveillance cameras.<eos> No bystanders either.<eos> Where the hell is the driver?<eos> Do you smell that?<eos> No, I don't smell anything.<eos> Smells like pee.<eos> Pop the trunk.<eos> What...?<eos> We found the driver.<eos> And hopefully a lead.
So I get out, and suddenly he pulls a gun and hits me in the face.<eos> I go down.<eos> Then... I hear a shot, and John Jr. screams.<eos> God rest his soul.<eos> Sounds like a hit.<eos> You think?<eos> Who do you think would want to kill your boss, Ronnie?<eos> One of the other families.<eos> Vinchettis got juice, so they come after us.<eos> "Us"?
I don't know.<eos> Maybe if I get to travel, I'm in a neighborhood I don't know, in a city I don't know.<eos> But it's not a fact that it would keep you safe.<eos> Or ever did.<eos> Right.<eos> But it did.<eos> Right.<eos> So, what do you want to do?<eos> I think we should put it before the family.<eos> Without prejudice.
Sure.<eos> Pop?<eos> Francis?<eos> It's unanimous.<eos> That's a good thing.<eos> I think.<eos> Hey, Janko.<eos> Hey.<eos> Find Derek the other night?<eos> Yeah, and the rest of the story.
Just... watch some TV.<eos> You know, maybe Sal's right, actually.<eos> Maybe we ought to pack up and... clear out.<eos> Spent all weekend trying to track Derek down, huh?<eos> Yeah, I looked in every gutter I ever fished him outta.<eos> No luck?<eos> Not till I found some of his crack pals last night.<eos> Derek told 'em the guy we're looking for is named Alphonso, who keep hitting these projects as long as the pickin's are good.<eos> Hey, boss, how about us, back out on the street, huh?<eos> Just like old times?
I don't need you to waive bail.<eos> Whatever it is, he can pay for it.<eos> No, he can't. I'll freeze his assets.<eos> In fact, I'll make sure that he doesn't get bail at all, because hacking into the bar is a federal crime, and if he can do that, he sure as hell can flee the country.<eos> You have no proof he hacked into the bar.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It's what he's accused of.<eos> So you want to make sure he walks out of court today, you bring me the letter.<eos> That better be you calling down to my office to explain why your golden boy was arrested for fraud last night.<eos> My golden boy?
But a woman is missing.<eos> God knows what's happened to her.<eos> This is no joking matter.<eos> Who's joking?<eos> We find these creatures, we find Rosie.<eos> How exactly do you plan to do that?<eos> Now what do you see?<eos> The light, glowing, over the hill.<eos> What do you hear?<eos> Just my footfalls.
I'm guessing everyone in this town has.<eos> You think this one's guilty because of the colour of his skin.<eos> You think he's innocent for the same reason.<eos> When a woman goes missing, it's reasonable to consider the husband.<eos> The bigger issue is, seems we were searching in the wrong place and unfortunately, it's getting a bit late for a search party.<eos> It's probably best to leave it till morning.<eos> If you're right, we're looking for a body.<eos> We don't want to miss any clues.<eos> And if you're right, she may well be several million miles from here.<eos> Martha Stiles.
It's bad enough he's got Booth pandering to him without you lot coming down here, giving us what's what.<eos> Maybe you should leave.<eos> You telling me to leave?<eos> Go on, Jimmy! Give it to him!<eos> That's it!<eos> You poncing sheeny.<eos> You wanna hit me?<eos> Harry...<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Right in the gut.
Welcome home.<eos> There they are!<eos> They're the monsters who took Rosie. - Where is she?<eos> - They're not monsters, they're people.<eos> - They look like monsters to me. - They attacked us.<eos> - Damn you!<eos> - No!<eos> Rosie!<eos> I thought I'd lost you.<eos> And you...
Witnesses reported this woman exhibited the strength of several men<eos> A drowning can make people do extraordinary things.<eos> Like the Michigan's stunt, for example<eos> The whole thing frozen over I dove in this hole but I can't find my way back<eos> I was drowning<eos> I'd punched out of 18 inches of ice<eos> The police claimed that she was possessed by some sort of demon<eos> The only thing that possessed her was a sick xxxxx.<eos> You don't believe in evil?<eos> Human evil, yes.
-<eos> His name was Wilson.<eos> I image you have several patients claiming to be possessed...<eos> Yes, it's now too common illusion.<eos> Have you ever had a case you thought could be actually possession?<eos> No.<eos> Well... ah... We do have one patient who has given me pos?<eos> A defrocked priest, named Nathaniel Ferdistat?<eos> It stepped the immagination of several other patients including Molly<eos> How many others?
And whose fault was it, mine?<eos> It was no one fault.<eos> Do you know how miserable I was? To have such a lunatic for a father<eos> Do you know the utter horror of losing one's mind?<eos> At first, I tried to justify, it was a quark of creative brain.<eos> Then I tried to camouflage with alcohol.<eos> It bottled to the piano Better a lash than a nut case.<eos> But I kept thinking deeper and deeper until it took everything from me<eos> My work... Your dear mother... Your brothers and sisters...<eos> You.
I know it's to late, but... but would you allow me to do something that<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you were thinking that this was a shade to fuss out.<eos> And you will just realise I'm just a figment of your imagination.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Hum, I thank you to take my word for it.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Come here, son.<eos> I was never cross with you<eos> Nor you.
And you will just realise I'm just a figment of your imagination.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Hum, I thank you to take my word for it.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Come here, son.<eos> I was never cross with you<eos> Nor you.<eos> I was cross with myself.<eos> You gave Adelaide and your kids a hell of a scare.<eos> Yes, all three of us.
I'll choke it down.<eos> You honestly believe that the man meant to harm you?<eos> I'm certain of it.<eos> Just like the cab driver last week?<eos> Reckless fool.<eos> And the fishmonger?<eos> That mackerel was off.<eos> I know you've been unusually anxious, as of late. And with good reason.<eos> Your book is being released in paperback, when?<eos> Monday, week.
My husband was murdered.<eos> No.<eos> And I don't know... how or why... or anything.<eos> So, you are here seeking answers from Benjamin.<eos> And when you get them, you will move on.<eos> That's the miracle of Mr Edison's invention.<eos> But if we know our loved ones are there, just on the other side, watching us, talking to us,<eos> waiting for us... How will we ever be able to move on?<eos> I found it!<eos> - The right frequency?
Mrs LaPier?<eos> It's... It's Jesper.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Ah... Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Someone help!<eos> D... Dr Millet!<eos> Dr Millet!<eos> Help!
Checked in three days ago.<eos> No indication she checked... out.<eos> Libby Cotter.<eos> Tomorrow would have been her 13th birthday.<eos> LIBBY: I remember being sick to my stomach.<eos> My parents were scared I had the flu.<eos> They brought me to Dr Millet.<eos> This was Monday?<eos> I think so.<eos> Today's Thursday.
I like him.<eos> Grew rather fond of him myself, for a while.<eos> A lot of things happened.<eos> My father died.<eos> My wife took ill.<eos> HOUDINI: You still feeling all right?<eos> WALT:<eos> Yes. Good.<eos> You have dreams, Walt?<eos> Every night.
Listen to me, when I was hit with the sign, that was a sign.<eos> I'm through.<eos> How can you abandon me, brother?<eos> Well, the way we abandoned our other brother.<eos> What other brother? All I remember on that boat was you, the tiger, and the wise, old fox.<eos> The...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> The fox was actually Tikku.<eos> Oh, sweet, little Tikku, I blocked out the memory.<eos> Oh, no!
Oh, I've-I've heard enough.<eos> My return to prankdom is elegant in its simplicity.<eos> All we do is cut the power in the store for 30 seconds.<eos> And no preservatives in the food, so everything will immediately go bad.<eos> Oh, it's an honor to be the guy you explain it to.<eos> Bart, wait!<eos> I like the new you.<eos> Listen, before you flip those circuit breakers, look deep in your sister's eyes and tell me what you see.<eos> I see... love.<eos> Unconditional love.
I'm saying that maybe he's trying to show you that there's more to life than Pearson Specter Litt.<eos> I'm not gonna be your attorney on this one.<eos> I think you can find someone better.<eos> No.<eos> I trust you, and there's no way I find someone that I trust more.<eos> Then find me when this is all over, and we'll see if we can put that trust to better use.<eos> Gretchen, whatever it is, it can wait till tomorrow.<eos> This can't wait.<eos> I want to apologize to you.<eos> For what?
I suspected you'd say that, which is why I prepared this.<eos> I understand if you'd prefer to ask somebody who's actually completed law school if that's legally binding.<eos> I'm perfectly capable of determining if this is legally binding or not. And I'm not going to let you bait me into saying anything to you.<eos> Well, that's fine with me.<eos> I'm not looking for you to talk.<eos> I'm looking for you to listen.<eos> Well, it's official.<eos> No matter what happens at trial, this firm isn't surviving Mike Ross.<eos> I know about the editorial, Louis.<eos> What editorial?
On the grounds that it's completely fabricated.<eos> Where's your proof?<eos> Besides the fact that I actually went to Harvard, there's no way you could have contacted all of those people since last night.<eos> Then I suggest you call every one of these people and put them on the stand.<eos> But when you do, every single one of them is gonna look you in the eye and say, "Who the hell are you?"<eos> What?<eos> No snappy comeback?<eos> You can try to trick these people all you want.<eos> But the fact is, you didn't go to Harvard, and this proves it.<eos> Objection.
You've never done that to me.<eos> Not one time.<eos> I... I don't know what to say.<eos> Say that when you're done and you've beaten this thing, you won't start acting like some asshole who went to Harvard.<eos> Well, I mean, can't really promise you that, Benjamin.<eos> I'll have gone to Harvard.<eos> That's not funny, Michael.<eos> Is the prosecution ready to call its next witness?<eos> Prosecution calls Rachel Zane.<eos> Objection.
He's right; you better know what the hell you're doing.<eos> Who said that I was gonna use this in the real trial?<eos> I get it.<eos> This is a fake, just like you.<eos> I said keep your goddamn voice down.<eos> This is as real as that affidavit was, okay?<eos> Now, you wanted to rattle me; I've rattled you.<eos> What are you gonna do about it?<eos> Prosecution calls Rachel Zane to the stand.<eos> Objection.
Objection!<eos> Ms. Zane, if you got married six weeks after dating the defendant, why are you engaged to him right now?<eos> Because we did it on a whim.<eos> And we had planned to have an annulment, but once we fell more in love, we thought that it might be wonderful to reveal it to our families after we were married again.<eos> And how, exactly, did it go when you got married the first time?<eos> We were in Las Vegas...<eos> Yeah, yeah, I don't give a shit where you were.<eos> What color was your dress?<eos> What color was the cake?<eos> - Objection.
Your Honor, get him off of her!<eos> - Harvey...<eos> - Tell me right now.<eos> Let the witness answer.<eos> The dress was white.<eos> And the cake was vanilla with a buttercream frosting.<eos> It was a small ceremony at around 10:00 p.m.<eos> And I remember the man who married us like it was yesterday because it was the most special day of my life.<eos> And when you came up with this story, did Mr. Ross at least give you the courtesy of letting you make up your own memories of your supposedly sacred day?<eos> Objection.
Before he was employed at Pearson Specter, to the best of your knowledge, he worked as a bike messenger and a part-time LSAT imposter?<eos> Yes.<eos> One last question, Mr. Evans.<eos> Is it at all possible that Mike Ross ever attended Harvard Law School?<eos> Not unless they had a satellite campus at 5307 Huntington Boulevard in Brooklyn.<eos> No more questions, Your Honor.<eos> Given that you smoked all this pot, Mr. Evans, isn't it possible that if Mike Ross commuted one day a week to Harvard Law that you might not remember that?<eos> I'd remember.<eos> Yeah, maybe you would, but you'd lie through your teeth about it anyway, wouldn't you?<eos> Objection.
Mr. Evans, isn't it true that you're a long-time drug dealer and your testimony today is only happening because you signed a deal with Ms. Gibbs giving you immunity?<eos> Doesn't mean I'm lying.<eos> Because you wouldn't lie just to get out of going to prison?<eos> No, I would not.<eos> Well, how about if the other reason was to get back at someone you've been jealous of your entire life?<eos> I've never been jealous of Mike Ross in my entire life.<eos> And I just caught you in a lie.<eos> Objection, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Evans, my next move is gonna be to call Jenny Griffith to the stand, and she's gonna testify that you lied to her for years about dealing, and when she found out about it, she left you for Mike Ross.<eos> Objection.
So now we've established that Mr. Ross is a liar.<eos> And now we're gonna find out if you're a liar.<eos> So, Ms. Paulsen, to the best of your knowledge, did Mike Ross go to Harvard Law School or not?<eos> I'd like to assert my Fifth Amendment right.<eos> Don't feel bad, Ms. Paulsen.<eos> I'm sure others will do the same thing too... because... the defense cannot produce one person who can place Mike Ross at Harvard Law.<eos> The witness could be excused, Your Honor.<eos> I think we've heard all we need to hear.<eos> Defense would like to call Jimmy Kirkwood to the stand.<eos> Objection.
No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Now we've heard enough.<eos> Ms. Gibbs, I'll give you 24 hours to prepare for cross.<eos> Oh, I don't need 24 hours, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Kirkwood, isn't it true that two days ago, Mr. Ross contacted you on the street outside of your office and the two of you got into a heated argument?<eos> I have the pictures.<eos> Would you like to see them?<eos> Yes, it's true.<eos> And isn't it also true that Mike Ross got your aunt a large settlement several months ago, and if he gets convicted, it's likely that that settlement gets overturned?<eos> Objection.
Calls for speculation.<eos> He's a Harvard lawyer.<eos> He's qualified to speculate.<eos> - Overruled.<eos> - No, you're right.<eos> It'd probably get overturned, but if you think that's why I said what I said, then obviously you don't know me.<eos> So Trevor Evans could lie because he's jealous, but you wouldn't lie for your aunt?<eos> I'm not lying for my aunt.<eos> But you are lying, because a person who's telling the truth wouldn't say they're lying at all.<eos> Objection.
It doesn't matter.<eos> She can't prove it.<eos> Louis, don't you get it?<eos> Katrina Bennett was your protégé.<eos> All that underhanded shit that you do, she learned all of it.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that she recorded you, and if that tape ever sees the light of day, any partner who wants can walk out that door and take their clients with them.<eos> No, they can't.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To the file room.
Elizabeth Keen... will you marry me?<eos> I know I wasn't the best husband.<eos> But I-I can be.<eos> I can be.<eos> I don't wanna be anyone else.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> "Yes." You can say... "Yes."<eos> Tom...<eos> If I've learned one thing from being on the run these past few months, it's that I can't tell you what I'm gonna want 10 years from now.<eos> Even a year from now.
They'll be coming for you.<eos> - But I don't know anything.<eos> - They don't know that.<eos> You can't walk away, Lizzy.<eos> They won't let you.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Knowing my name is no way to stay alive.<eos> So let's forgo introductions, shall we, Janet?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Information.
Thank you for your concern, Lizzy.<eos> Borsheim.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Reddington.<eos> Fashionably late as always, huh?<eos> Marcus.<eos> Hello, everyone.<eos> It's good to see so many friends and even more enemies.<eos> Welcome to Shell Island.<eos> Cheers.
Why am I not hearing anything?<eos> Aram, is he in or not?<eos> The only assistance I gave Agent Keen was after she shot the Attorney General.<eos> They were on TV always working together.<eos> She was a fugitive, Dmitri.<eos> I was paid a significant fee by certain unnamed parties to aid in her escape.<eos> It's what I do.<eos> That is true, but we are not just relying on the word of Janet Macnamara.<eos> She provided us with access to documentation confirming that in the last 28 months, significant resources have been directed to a top secret task force dedicated to the apprehension of key figures in the so-called criminal underworld based on information provided by a single high-level informant.<eos> You.
- I am so totally confused.<eos> - Is it possible they know each other?<eos> If that's true, my head is definitely going to explode.<eos> By the way, very clever, Marcus. Abducting Janet Macnamara in your search for the truth.<eos> But you and I both know the confession you coerced from that poor woman you're holding at Calabrese Fine Imports was simply to confirm your lie.<eos> You got that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Calabrese Fine Imports.<eos> 2119 McWhorther Street.<eos> On my way.
I prefer the bookish teacher.<eos> Well, then you're in luck, because, uh, I got a job-- a real job-- teaching history at, uh, Shorewood high school in Boston.<eos> Boston?<eos> You're gonna move to--<eos> We're gonna move to Boston.<eos> I know-- I know you need, uh, time to think about everything, and I get that, but what happened to you was terrifying.<eos> Okay?<eos> It was like a giant flashing sign from God that you need to start over somewhere else.<eos> If you don't want to do it for us, then do it... for our kid.<eos> Our-- our kid?
Sam Archer was whipped until an artery burst and he bled to death.<eos> The bruising, fractures, and deep puncture wounds indicate that Joseph Gibson's extremities were crushed with some device called "The Spanish Boot".<eos> None of the victims had a record.<eos> - Why were they targeted?<eos> - We are not sure.<eos> We're still going over case files.<eos> Sir.<eos> From your wife.<eos> Those are beautiful.<eos> My office.
Unmarried-- totally fixable.<eos> Uh, unmarried was never a part of my list.<eos> Yeah, they're-- they're all fixable, Tom, except for one--<eos> Can't he?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Reddington.<eos> We can get away from him.<eos> His life, my life, is so filled with violence and... anger and hatred and death.<eos> How can I bring a child into that world?<eos> My world.
If you're not controlling the Vehm, then who is?<eos> I'm a dead man if I say.<eos> I came here for one thing, but I've decided I'm gonna leave with two.<eos> The first is the name of the person who controls the Vehm.<eos> And the second?<eos> A song, Gerald.<eos> I so wanted to be a scout-- tying knots, the Pinewood Derby, and the campfire songs.<eos> Oh, those songs.<eos> I keep trying to explain to Dembe, but I'm no singer.<eos> Just one song!
I'll explain everything then.<eos> Not before.<eos> They're busy.<eos> The FBI raided their chamber of horrors-- killed one, captured some others.<eos> They'll talk.<eos> And when they do, they'll talk about you.<eos> So, my proposition is this.<eos> Do what I'm asking, do it now, and I'll make sure you go someplace quiet where the FBI will never find you.<eos> Up here!<eos> Around the corner!
I think you should leave.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, I should probably mention, I booked a pregnancy massage for you.<eos> She'll be here at 9:00.<eos> Her name's Edwina, she's a registered nurse, and she smells absolutely divine.<eos> I hope it goes with the rest of your stuff.<eos> I'm told it pulls out.<eos> Thank you, Aram.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Uh, what... for, exactly?
Reddington moved her out.<eos> Got her a bigger apartment.<eos> Why?<eos> For your security.<eos> We'll keep a man in this apartment 24 hours a day.<eos> Anybody who wants to get you will have to come past us.<eos> Nice hair.<eos> Hello, my name is Elizabeth Keen.<eos> I'm calling about my pregnancy.<eos> My child.
They're transferred to a secure vault and basement work rooms, where they're placed in settings and shipped to stores all around the world.<eos> And you want to hit those work rooms?<eos> I'm getting in.<eos> All I need is a pretty face to help me get there.<eos> Know where I can find one of those?<eos> Remember the jazz club you took me to in that little cave in St. Germain?<eos> We should go there right now.<eos> No, it closed.<eos> When did it close?<eos> Six months ago.
So would I.<eos> But you're giving her away.<eos> For what?<eos> A business deal that will never hold?<eos> A war that will never end?<eos> Oh, it will.<eos> The Erikssons are all coming to the celebration.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> We kill them tomorrow.<eos> All of them.
I'm so honored you were able to join us.<eos> I'm a sucker for mob weddings.<eos> What a night.<eos> Raymond, right?<eos> Mads tells me you two have business dealings?<eos> I didn't know the two of you were on a first-name basis.<eos> We're doing our best to forgive and forget.<eos> Mm. There's some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us.<eos> And when we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies.<eos> To our enemies.
You told me that he would never be found, and now he just... shows up?<eos> Calm down.<eos> It-it's gonna be fine.<eos> Calm down?<eos> I didn't work directly with the Linleys-- Noah Shuster did.<eos> Could we speak with him?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> You know where to meet me.<eos> One hour.
Or this country's enemies?<eos> Yeah, it occurred to me.<eos> That's why I modified the code to include a phone-home component.<eos> Whenever the program gets used, it makes contact with my server so I can track who's downloaded it.<eos> We're going to need that data.<eos> Well, if you raided my storage locker, then you already have it.<eos> _<eos> As far as you go, pops.<eos> Whatever you're looking for, this ain't it.<eos> Pops.
Previously on The Blacklist...<eos> Elizabeth Keen, will you marry me?<eos> You will not marry her.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I didn't ask daddy's permission?<eos> Thanks, boys.<eos> He's reckless.<eos> He's not worthy of being your husband, and he sure as hell is not worthy of raising that child.<eos> I want to keep the baby.<eos> Our baby.
The Chinese are looking for me.<eos> It's only a matter of time before--<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> Please! Please!<eos> That recording isn't real!<eos> It's all some kind of frame-up!<eos> It was released by a man called The Caretaker!<eos> That's who you have to find!<eos> The Caretaker!
I see you're busy as ever.<eos> Raymond?<eos> You didn't say you were bringing persons.<eos> Well, you know Dembe.<eos> And this is former FBI Agent Elizabeth Keen.<eos> FBI?<eos> They employ me as a consultant.<eos> He employs me as an inside source.<eos> And in that capacity, she has alerted me to a troubling development and may have grave repercussions for many of your clients and, well, you.<eos> Me?
Velov was the agent assigned to find her.<eos> He was getting close, she knew it.<eos> That's why she allegedly walked into the ocean.<eos> She wanted the world to believe she drowned.<eos> But Velov knows differently.<eos> He tracked her to a hotel in Prague.<eos> She had just left.<eos> But in such a hurry, she missed this...<eos> A photo of her little girl.<eos> Me.
And now someone out there is singularly focused on coming for her.<eos> - Coming to kill her?<eos> To abduct her.<eos> They're sending Solomon.<eos> In retrospect, that's a perfect choice.<eos> He knows us intimately.<eos> He knows about the task force.<eos> They gave us a false trail, and we followed the scent.<eos> Donald, if I'm right and this was all an elaborate feint, all that matters is that you get to that church now.<eos> On my way.
No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Hey!<eos> Did you see a woman walk into the water?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't see no woman.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah. I'm sure.<eos> Mister, the only living soul I've seen on this stretch in over two weeks is just you.<eos> Just me.
I didn't see no woman.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah. I'm sure.<eos> Mister, the only living soul I've seen on this stretch in over two weeks is just you.<eos> Just me.<eos> Yep.<eos> Canned mushrooms.<eos> Best I could do.<eos> Behind you.<eos> Just me.
Yeah. I'm sure.<eos> Mister, the only living soul I've seen on this stretch in over two weeks is just you.<eos> Just me.<eos> Yep.<eos> Canned mushrooms.<eos> Best I could do.<eos> Behind you.<eos> Just me.<eos> Yep.<eos> Just you.
Please. I want to buy it.<eos> Ain't worth anywhere near that.<eos> It is to me.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> To Katarina, love Papa.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> It was me or Masha.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Raymond, you did save me.<eos> Through her.
Gone.<eos> - What floor did it stop on?<eos> - 7.<eos> And where do those stairs lead?<eos> West alley service entrance, end of that corridor.<eos> - All right, let me take the alley.<eos> - Okay.<eos> FBI!<eos> Freeze!<eos> On the ground!

Covert.<eos> Dangerous.<eos> Necessary.<eos> And they require the expertise of an independent organization.<eos> Don't patronize me.<eos> Those people got one of my best agents killed, and you expect me to walk away.<eos> How can I justify that?<eos> I know full well you look the other way when you need to, because working with an international criminal enables you to bring good to the world.<eos> I can't look the other way.<eos> Not this time.
You won't be troubled again with unexpected visitors.<eos> I know how you value your privacy.<eos> Why didn't you go with him?<eos> What would be the point?<eos> There's nothing I could do that would really matter.<eos> Cry me a river. Hmm?<eos> What the hell are you really doing here?<eos> You... you gave me the news about Masha.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> A way forward.
Previously on "The Blacklist"...<eos> Mr. Reddington.<eos> We're going to work.<eos> I can't look the other way.<eos> Not this time.
Next, please.<eos> Sir. Sir.<eos> You've been randomly selected for a check.<eos> Good, thanks.<eos> I'm honored they want me to be President, but I don't tell them how to spend their money... although I like how they're spending it.<eos> Attention, travelers.<eos> You are not required to... As President, I will say no to amnesty, defend the Second Amendment, and return the job of educating our children to where it belongs... at the local level.<eos> What's your emergency?<eos> Hands in the air... now!<eos> Over your head!

Sorry, brother.<eos> Whatever she's paying you, I'll triple it.<eos> She told me you'd say something like that.<eos> All right, watch his head now.<eos> If you care so much for your partner, what are you gonna do when he wakes up?<eos> You just hit him on the head.<eos> He got jumped from behind by your man, who kidnapped me and helped you to escape.<eos> That's what will be in my report.<eos> There's no cameras back here.<eos> Stairs.
These people saved him from a z-pack.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Thank god.<eos> So, you're the man on the list?<eos> The girl told us.<eos> She thought we could help.<eos> We don't get many visitors out here.<eos> A few traders used to stop by.<eos> We had enough chemicals and tools to trade for seeds and cooking oil.<eos> Some weapons.
Are you insane?<eos> We'll get slaughtered.<eos> I don't have time for your bullshit right now, Murphy!<eos> Now we're sticking with the plan that Warren laid out.<eos> Now just get where you're supposed to be.<eos> A simple please.<eos> Murphy.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Doctors.
Previously on "The Americans"... - We work for our country.<eos> - The Soviet Union.
I don't want to be filled with regrets. But I am.<eos> Mostly I'm sorry that I didn't love more and better.<eos> I held back giving love from fear it would swallow me up.<eos> Embrace it with passion and joy.<eos> This is all there is.<eos> To Scarlet, the first great love of my life... .. I only hope... .. that David will treat you well and you find the happiness you deserve.<eos> Of course now up here in the heavens, all this seems so trivial.<eos> Up here I can love you all.<eos> I wish we could've made it work.<eos> But especially to my beautiful Nicole... .. my great and wonderful saviour,
I just wanted to drop this off to celebrate the good news.<eos> Isn't it great about Barney?<eos> - 50,000 to 1, they're saying.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> But I...<eos> But not now.<eos> Right.<eos> Everything's still up in the air. Ha.<eos> Another time.
Some drug smuggling, extortion...<eos> Mmm.<eos> .. money laundering, arms dealing.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Great.<eos> GREAT.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> You are just gonna be so great in there and I am gonna be with you the whole time.<eos> Just one second.
She mentioned she might bring a friend.<eos> I said, "Okay, as long as he brings a photo I.D."<eos> She didn't give you his name?<eos> Uh-uh. No, we don't require an advance list of all potential visitors. Sorry.<eos> At the very least, you must require visitors to declare who they're coming to see.<eos> Course.<eos> Harris Waylon Greer.<eos> I take it you're both familiar with the Triborough Killer.<eos> Between 1986 and 1992, H.W. Greer strangled or suffocated 16 women in the Bronx, Queens and Manhattan.<eos> Just like our victim.
How can you be so sure?<eos> I can't be.<eos> Not 100%.<eos> No matter what that machine says.<eos> But I am sure that Jane didn't do this alone.<eos> I want to get the people that did this to us.<eos> Did this to Mayfair.<eos> If that means that I have to swallow my feelings about Jane for a while... so be it.<eos> I'm in.<eos> For Mayfair.

Over here!<eos> - Take care of him.<eos> - We got him.<eos> Dr. Charles?<eos> Stella, I got your message.<eos> So you're saying that Grant was in your apartment uninvited?<eos> Yeah, I found his hospital bracelet on the floor, but he was gone before I got home.<eos> Listen, just as a precaution, I've contacted Chicago PD.<eos> - Oh, I don't...<eos> - Just a precaution, Stella.
Listen, do you want to die?<eos> Quit jerking around!<eos> Be strong for me.<eos> I know you can do it.<eos> There, that's it.<eos> Okay?<eos> The union's between a rock and a rock here.<eos> There's what happened and then there's the perception of what happened.<eos> Jimmy filed a grievance against you, as is his right, and then you suspended him.<eos> For insubordination.
Sorry if I'm not in a hand-holding mood right now.<eos> I had nothing to do with that!<eos> You're gonna be fine, Nikki.<eos> Just stick to the plan.<eos> Let's roll out.<eos> Why you calling me on my personal phone?<eos> I saw the news, Connor.<eos> - Good for you.<eos> - I never agreed to this.<eos> - To what?
It's a blessing.<eos> I hear you.<eos> Kate?<eos> Are any of these men the person that did this to you?<eos> That's him.<eos> Are you going to arrest him now?<eos> We already got his ass.<eos> [cries]<eos> Thank you.<eos> Of course.
Do you think you're special, a one-of-a-kind snowflake?<eos> You needed to get in that house.<eos> And you got me in.<eos> I thought he did it.<eos> And you framed him for it.<eos> You've been served with a restraining order.<eos> You're not to come in contact with their son Adam.<eos> They live across the street.<eos> Then don't go past that tree.<eos> How bad this time?
What, you're on their side?<eos> We need their vote.<eos> Did you get mail?<eos> Who's it from, bud?<eos> Adam?<eos> Adam.<eos> Who sent you that postcard?<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> This go out today?<eos> 9:00 and noon.
He is talking to another lawyer there.<eos> But your prints are all over the bat.<eos> Well, of course they are. It's mine.<eos> How'd it get in his house?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Asher sat in jail 10 years for a crime he didn't commit.<eos> - That's on us.<eos> - You mean me.<eos> Fine.<eos> You.
This right here?<eos> Your skin is blistering.<eos> It's like you played a doubleheader.<eos> I'd like you to go now.<eos> You're a lucky man, Hank.<eos> Took a baseball bat to that entire table...<eos> And it didn't break.<eos> It's sturdier than it seems.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For all of it.
_<eos> I don't understand.<eos> He talked about you.<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> I don't have anywhere else to go.<eos> What about your family?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> You don't believe what?<eos> All of it.
I-it's not your stuff.<eos> - Why are you upset?<eos> - You know why...<eos> This is what you wanted.<eos> Everything's okay now.<eos> You got your brother back.<eos> You're not my brother, Ben!<eos> You need to stop calling me that.<eos> My name is Adam.<eos> _
Do what you got to do.<eos> I'm being manipulated here, but I don't know how.<eos> That's why they call it manipulation.<eos> Cute penguin.<eos> Red Vine?<eos> What's with you and those protein bars?<eos> Stakeouts require junk food.<eos> You followed me here?<eos> So what are we looking at?<eos> Street gang?
You're starting to get those crazy eyes.<eos> I myself am gonna head home and spend some quality time with my angry husband.<eos> Bye.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Just outside.<eos> Why?<eos> To get some fresh air.<eos> At 2:00 a.m.?<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> Every night?
Making it harder for us to keep our children safe, to provide them with, uh...<eos> All right, Mr. Asher.<eos> Just sign here, and you're all set.<eos> - Here we go. - Ah.<eos> That's your neighbor, right?<eos> The mayor?<eos> - Yeah. -<eos> -Let's go.<eos> Who you voting for?<eos> The other guy.
Where were you?<eos> Out.<eos> With who?<eos> Friend.<eos> Well, Mom killed it.<eos> Pretty much every outlet is saying she won.<eos> Nice.<eos> I-I-I messed up.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
Previously on "The Family"...<eos> - I did not get my son back.<eos> - Claire...<eos> I'm sorry I'm not him.<eos> You don't have to call me Claire.<eos> How's your boyfriend?<eos> People disappoint.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - For what?
Previously on "The Family"...<eos> - I did not get my son back.<eos> - Claire...<eos> I'm sorry I'm not him.<eos> You don't have to call me Claire.<eos> How's your boyfriend?<eos> People disappoint.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - For what?<eos> The debate.
Ugh.<eos> And we can hire people just to bring us snacks.<eos> I'm stoked.<eos> Let's not get ahead of ourselves.<eos> I haven't been elected yet.<eos> Well, if you would like a free ride to therapy, the free car service is leaving.<eos> Oh.<eos> Don't forget about dinner tonight.<eos> What's your favorite?<eos> Chinese food.
Sorry about that.<eos> What's up?<eos> Just thinking about you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Mm. Which parts?<eos> What?<eos> Which parts of me were you thinking about?<eos> All of them.<eos> "All of them."
I'm an idiot.<eos> Sorry I haven't called.<eos> I'm just gonna lay low till I even out.<eos> I love you.<eos> He called his husband last night.<eos> He's fine, Nina.<eos> Ravioli, corn, and a few protein shakes.<eos> Um, I'll open it up so you can get to it all real easy.<eos> Where's your monster taking you?<eos> Canada.
Thanks anyways.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> He had a dog.<eos> I wanted to give it a treat.<eos> He took me to his truck.<eos> How many times have I told you never get in a car with someone that you don't know?<eos> But he had a dog.<eos> I don't care if he had an elephant.<eos> You never get in a stranger's car.<eos> Ever, ever.
My name is Ben.<eos> We've got a winner.<eos> Mom?<eos> I have to go now.<eos> No.<eos> I have to.<eos> No.<eos> Please don't.<eos> I can't stay here forever.<eos> Just one more minute.
Mom?<eos> I have to go now.<eos> No.<eos> I have to.<eos> No.<eos> Please don't.<eos> I can't stay here forever.<eos> Just one more minute.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Just one more.
If he's got a rifle, tell him to aim for the light switch.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> The back of the head, top of the neck... that'll do it the quickest.<eos> He's not gonna hurt you.<eos> Yet.<eos> But you have to do something.<eos> What?<eos> Make them stop looking for you.<eos> Both a brother and a sister, huh?<eos> Not at the same time.
And landed myself in jail, and by the time I got out, um, I couldn't find my kid.<eos> He was gone.<eos> I had a 2-year-old.<eos> They took him and put him in the foster system... and that was it.<eos> Anyway.<eos> You eat like a bird, so food's on me.<eos> It was nice to meet you.<eos> What was his name?<eos> What?<eos> Your little boy.
Yeah, he must be, in order to get - the insta-invite to this party. - I know!<eos> How much do you like that dork?<eos> He's pretty cool with that accent, though.<eos> Still hazing.<eos> I think I really like him.<eos> Yeah, you know who else is smitten these days?<eos> Dad.<eos> - What?<eos> - Did he finally ask out Linda?<eos> My mom?
I need to steal her.<eos> Listen, kid, I just want to say that I am sorry.<eos> A business industry associate pointed out to me that, well, all of my interfering might not be good for you.<eos> From now on, I'm going to take a more traditional angel approach and I'm gonna back off.<eos> Based on a small sample - of all my experience with you...<eos> - Allison, I'm serious.<eos> And I'm only half in the bag, so you know it's real.<eos> - I just want to thank you. - Oh.<eos> Home audio's just not as difficult as it looks.<eos> Not the speakers.

I just really wanted to impress you.<eos> I kind of got swept up in the moment.<eos> Sorry, I hope one little fib's not a big deal.<eos> Look, my last relationship was a disaster.<eos> The guy lied and cheated.<eos> Allison, I am not that guy.<eos> I know.<eos> But I have a mountain of issues and I don't think I'm ready for this.<eos> Couldn't have said it better myself, because I did say it myself.<eos> Hey, guys, ooh.
I'm sorry. (wry chuckle)<eos> Bad time to lie to you.<eos> So, should you warn someone about the tsunami?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no,<eos> I never get involved with the weather department.<eos> Hey, what's up, John?<eos> Seen Lee?<eos> Cops did a sweep of the park.<eos> He ended up in Cedars.<eos> Psych ward.
Okay, well, what about the attack on Fisher?<eos> It was Barbiero.<eos> I mean, whoever he was working for tried to call it off, but Barbiero wouldn't listen.<eos> And Turner?<eos> In the stitch, I heard something about Turner moving some asset that the killer wanted.<eos> The voice on the phone, she said that they would come for me when they think I'm ready.<eos> - Ready for what?<eos> - To hear the truth.<eos> So what do we do until then?<eos> Our jobs.
Better than you two?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> I've already traced the Insulin pump hack to a fixed address in Eagle Rock.<eos> - Let's go say hi.<eos> - All right.<eos> Get this back to Catgirl.<eos> I don't want anything to do with that.<eos> Okay, maybe Camille got the address wrong.<eos> Or maybe Camille got the exact address these guys wanted us to have. One that leads us nowhere.<eos> Yeah, but why this nowhere?
- Excuse me?<eos> No, sorry not you.<eos> A different bitch.<eos> I gotta go!<eos> Can I get my cards back, please?<eos> What?<eos> The bank instructed us to cut the cards, but if you got a complaint, I'm sure there's a bitch at the bank you can talk to.<eos> Okay.<eos> They cut up all your cards?<eos> Even your super-special black one?
No, sorry not you.<eos> A different bitch.<eos> I gotta go!<eos> Can I get my cards back, please?<eos> What?<eos> The bank instructed us to cut the cards, but if you got a complaint, I'm sure there's a bitch at the bank you can talk to.<eos> Okay.<eos> They cut up all your cards?<eos> Even your super-special black one?<eos> Especially the little black one.
Derek's wife just caught him in bed with another woman.<eos> You ruined us with some stranger.<eos> On a stupid website?<eos> The wife is Ellie.<eos> She and Derek were married and he used stealaglance to cheat on her.<eos> I should've hacked into your computer a long time ago.<eos> Can you see their address anywhere?<eos> Where are you now?<eos> At their house.<eos> Different day.
We took her into my secret underground lair.<eos> Ooh. I'd love to see that sometime.<eos> I'll give you the address and you can come over.<eos> Walking into a trap is your thing, not mine.<eos> The neighbors told me they got divorced, but I'm not sure if that was before or after her accident.<eos> What accident?<eos> Tell me something.<eos> Did you feel better after you murdered Derek?<eos> Did killing your husband serve justice?<eos> Ex-husband.
We're doing everything we can to gather information on him, Mr. Cox.<eos> Well, how bout you grab that asshole and throw him in jail?<eos> How hard is that?<eos> Do you want him in jail overnight on an assault charge, or do you want him locked away for 30 years?<eos> The fucking animal has got my daughter.<eos> I have three kids.<eos> You got my word.<eos> I will bring your daughter back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - For what?
You still got plausible deniability if this thing goes sideways.<eos> Listen, you made a two-man plan...<eos> The risk is on me.<eos> I know you want to help, but...<eos> There's no buts, all right?<eos> Laura's in danger.<eos> I'm not gonna wait in the damn car.<eos> Now, let's do this.<eos> BILLY: Snake cam's on.<eos> No sign of them.
And he knew it.<eos> I can't change it.<eos> What I did, I can't change that.<eos> What?<eos> What did you do?<eos> JON: My buddy and I were wasted.<eos> The bar was less than a mile from our house.<eos> And I hit them.<eos> A mother, a father.<eos> A teenage boy.
Martha's Vineyard mug on her desk?<eos> Jon implied that he had a run-in with the cops on the Vineyard.<eos> Allow me.<eos> - Could be a coincidence.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> Something terrible happened in his past and somehow this is all connected.<eos> - Anything yet?<eos> - Still working the magic.<eos> Okay, direct your wand to traffic accidents 1992 to 2000.<eos> Oh. My office.
- Morning it is.<eos> Say hello to John Doe.<eos> Well, an 8-year-old could figure out the cause of death here.<eos> Running in front of a bus will kill you.<eos> True indeed, though in this particular case, it appears said runner was pushed.<eos> You sure?<eos> Ear buds.<eos> Victim could have been lost in song.<eos> - Not seen the red light.<eos> - No way.
I was going to give it to Dr. Silverman this Friday.<eos> I had other business to go over with him.<eos> Uh, what other business?<eos> Dr. Silverman was approached by FIFA.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> To be their Chief Medical whatever.<eos> His wife told us.<eos> Right.<eos> In order to bring his stepson, they needed signed permission from the biological father.<eos> Kurt something.
- Come on.<eos> - Nurse!<eos> Walt! Hey.<eos> Help, Nurse!<eos> Dad.<eos> Sit down.<eos> - Dad.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Dad, where are you going?<eos> Room 119.
She's fine.<eos> She got away.<eos> But... [groans] ...Trot Simic is dead.<eos> Shot.<eos> Who shot him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I thought I had him, Henry.<eos> Trot?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Walker.
Uh, we rang in the New Year together, actually.<eos> She gave me a list of resolutions, a list of ways I could be a more successful, more miserable person.<eos> She calls it being a realist.<eos> I say it's her being a bitch.<eos> Well, you seem angry with her.<eos> You think I'm exaggerating.<eos> You just wait.<eos> Donna's missing.<eos> Like I said, she does what she wants whenever she wants.<eos> Not this time.
You got the book, good job.<eos> What's different about you?<eos> Ah, come here, Ash!<eos> Whoa.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm you.<eos> From another time.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I came for that.<eos> And for Ash.
Well, that's good. You found yourself a keeper.<eos> Now where the hell is my Pablo?<eos> It's hard to say, see, most cultures have different names for the netherworld.<eos> Uh, the Aztecs called it Mictlan.<eos> The Greeks, the Tartarus.<eos> You call it hell.<eos> None of it's correct, but your tiny little minds cannot comprehend the reality of the dimension that your friend now finds himself in.<eos> You know, you almost had me.<eos> You really blocked off all my options.<eos> Well, most of them, anyway.
Yeah, that's pretty good.<eos> Uh, You don't mind if I check your guitar case, do you?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Mom, you gonna let her do that?<eos> Oh, sure, go crying to your mommy.<eos> See if she can't fluff and fold your problems away.<eos> Ow!<eos> See?<eos> Some things are more important to me than choosing a vacation.<eos> Like honesty and trust.
Okay, you need to get out of here.<eos> No, no, no way.<eos> I'm with you. This curfew has been ordered by President Al Fayeed under an emergency national security mandate and will be enforced ten minutes from now.<eos> They moved in.<eos> Hundreds of them.<eos> Government troops.<eos> You can go out the back exit of the building.<eos> Get home without going through the Square.<eos> Hey, hey. You know where it is?<eos> Around the corner?
Yes.<eos> Scroll down.<eos> "I'm being brave, Mommy.<eos> You be brave, too."<eos> I, Leila Haddad, swear by Almighty God to uphold the laws, respect the Constitution, and faithfully execute the duties of the office of President of Abuddin.<eos> That was a good speech, Father.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You heading back to the hospital?<eos> I thought I'd go with you.<eos> Yes. In a minute.
It's just a rock.<eos> Wait, wait, wait. 50 pounds of lye?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He said it would be under the name Donato.<eos> Can you cross-check recent orders around the city?<eos> You know, to, like, see if anything matches that?<eos> Jane, that much lye, unless this guy is making a hell of a lot of homemade soap, that's as much as you need to break down a body.<eos> Whose body are they trying to get rid of and why?<eos> What have you gotten yourself into?<eos> Nothing good.
- Behinds a dead platinum mine, nothing.<eos> Can NRO give us some more recent satellite images?<eos> You're looking at it.<eos> Apparently, it's not exactly a high priority.<eos> I've expedited clearance through the State Department to investigate.<eos> An FBI attaché will meet you in Ankara, Turkey, and escort you to the island.<eos> Our jet is waiting for you at JFK.<eos> All right, grab your go-bags.<eos> Uh... we can handle this, all right, if you want to sit this one out.<eos> Not a chance.
I was in hell... being tortured by the devil.<eos> What did this devil look like?<eos> I'm not talking to you.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> You have to try to remember, Charlie.<eos> Who was there with you?<eos> What did hell look like?<eos> How'd you get out?<eos> I swam across a river.<eos> What river?
That driver that picked up Charlie, where was that?<eos> Down the road from Fort Beck at about 8:00 A.M.<eos> Drop a pin in it.<eos> Didn't Borden's toxicology report narrow down the last time Charlie was drugged?<eos> Yeah, at around 7:30 A.M.<eos> All right, so he's been on the run for half an hour, could've covered four to five miles at most.<eos> Didn't Charlie say he swam across the River Styx after he escaped?<eos> He was drugged out of his mind.<eos> Yeah, but what if he swam across something?<eos> A real river.
- Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - You look amazing.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> The waitress's earrings cost more than my car.<eos> Never mind her earrings, I like your car.<eos> It's... it's an antique.<eos> I got you your usual sugar drink.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cheers.
And the best way to do that is to find out the person who's trafficking these women.<eos> We should bring in Stern and Aubin.<eos> No.<eos> If we bring them in, it'll tip off the real killer.<eos> There's something else we could try.<eos> There's a girl at the detention center with an earmarked birthday.<eos> She's scheduled to be put on Aubin's bus this afternoon.<eos> All right.<eos> So, if we tag that bus, we'll see who takes her.<eos> Absolutely not.
I can't risk leaving anything that'll tie me to it.<eos> Burn it to the ground.<eos> What should I do with them?<eos> I can't risk leaving any evidence.<eos> We might need her.<eos> Weller, I'm going in after her!<eos> Stay here, Reade!<eos> We gotta take 'em down first!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Help!
I'll get there as soon as I can.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Hey. How is he?<eos> - Still in surgery.<eos> Until we hear otherwise, we're just gonna have to take no news as good news.<eos> - We should be there...<eos> - Look, I know this is hard, but if you want to help Weller, let's find the person who did this to him.<eos> Every second we waste makes that tougher.<eos> Right!
And with traces of latex.<eos> Same with the painting.<eos> So I guess he's smart enough to use gloves.<eos> And you still think that the bombing was specifically targeting us?<eos> Gallery footage confirms that the camera by the fire alarm was added after the thief blacked out the security camera.<eos> And it's hooked up to a wireless transmitter.<eos> So he could watch and wait for us.<eos> Maybe he just has a thing for law enforcement in general.<eos> No, he stole one painting.<eos> That one.
My vector search found a known associate who turned off his cell phone at the exact same time.<eos> Sam Lee, born and raised in Queens.<eos> Now it's starting to look like a four-man crew.<eos> Except there's no fourth body.<eos> Welll, he could have been working for the other team.<eos> Do you really think he was actually on side with the robbers?<eos> He might be their inside man.<eos> Makes sense... the heist team would know when and where to strike.<eos> The driver was shot at close range, wasn't he?<eos> Yeah, through the passenger window.
Sam?<eos> The General.<eos> Today would have been my one-year anniversary with David.<eos> And I've been trying to block it out, until I got a call from our favorite restaurant this morning... confirming a table for tonight.<eos> So David must have booked it.<eos> I see.<eos> And on top of that, the "Times" published his last crossword puzzle today, so I feel like I keep getting these messages from him, and I know it sounds...<eos> I think you should go.<eos> What?<eos> To the dinner.
She double-crossed you?<eos> We've been doing deliveries of sarin to Seoul every quarter for the last three years.<eos> She's the only one who knows the ins and the outs of the operation.<eos> Who is she selling it to?<eos> I don't know, but when I realized it was her, I was afraid she'd come here.<eos> I knew I needed to destroy all this before it's too late.<eos> How much sarin is missing?<eos> 40 canisters.<eos> Did Vanessa help you move the weapons out of the country to Korea?<eos> Through her company.
We just checked all the containers.<eos> 36 canisters of sarin accounted for.<eos> The general said that 40 were stolen.<eos> Whoever Vanessa sold the sarin to took four canisters.<eos> Presumably to use on home soil.<eos> Do you think she was helping them with an American target?<eos> Who do you work for?<eos> Thousands of people, including us and your own family, could be exposed to the sarin if you don't help us.<eos> Who do you work for? !<eos> North Korea.
How did you...<eos> After she passed away, some of her things were sold.<eos> I knew how much that necklace meant to her, so I bought it.<eos> Now it's yours.<eos> Do you want to buy me a birthday drink?<eos> Yeah, I'd love to, but I've got plans tonight.<eos> Allie.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Right.<eos> Another night.
No!<eos> Uhh! No!<eos> I was asleep!<eos> I'm so sorry. I met you a few times.<eos> I dated David Wagner from 5C.<eos> You mean the kid that just died?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, that's him.<eos> Listen, he left something in his apartment and it's really important that I get it.<eos> Absolutely not.
How long did that last?<eos> Too long.<eos> I wasn't...<eos> It took me a while to get here.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're here now.<eos> I'm in the city a lot nowadays... and I think that's probably the last time I'm gonna let Dennis buy me a drink.<eos> So I was thinking...<eos> There you go.<eos> Now you have mine, too.<eos> Alexandra.
I don't know what happened.<eos> Sarah...<eos> Mom! Mom!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad!<eos> Call an ambulance.<eos> Dad!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - For what?
Sarah...<eos> Mom! Mom!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad!<eos> Call an ambulance.<eos> Dad!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - For what?<eos> Everything.
Mom! Mom!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad!<eos> Call an ambulance.<eos> Dad!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - For what?<eos> Everything.<eos> Today and... scavenger hunt.
- Mm. - Please, look again.<eos> - You think I'm stupid? - Mm-mm.<eos> I don't need to look twice at second-rate forgeries.<eos> Get down!<eos> ISI!<eos> Down!<eos> You're working for ISI?<eos> Get down!<eos> Get down!<eos> - Who? - Mm! Mm!
We need to work together.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> We need to move.<eos> Stay close, cover our backs.<eos> Can you handle that?<eos> Don't point it at me, all right?<eos> Sounds like it's coming from the cafeteria.<eos> - All right, which way?
I didn't even know it was a gun until the kid ran up on me.<eos> This kid.<eos> What's he look like?<eos> What's he wearing?<eos> It's Levi Hart.<eos> What?<eos> The player that just got busted?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, where'd he go?<eos> Defensive meeting room.
Great.<eos> You ready to go?<eos> I just have to grab my coat.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, I'll meet you in the lobby?<eos> Nice necklace, by the way.<eos> Oh. Thanks.<eos> Someone special gave it to me.<eos> - Thanks. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Cheers. - Cheers.
Oh! Yeah!<eos> - I told you I would win again.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're clearly gonna win again.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> I... I... I should go.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're gonna feed those hungry hippos next.<eos> Hmm? - Next time.
Less than five minutes.<eos> I have control of the other elevators, but I can't do anything about SIOC.<eos> Sarah!<eos> Kurt!<eos> - Kurt!<eos> - Reade!<eos> We're gonna get you guys out, all right?<eos> All right, just hang on!<eos> Are we landing?<eos> On your knees!
You talked to me after Chicago.<eos> They are the ones who decide what secrets the American people can and can't know.<eos> And you either fall in line, or they zero you out.<eos> It was my first deep-cover op.<eos> Alex's father and I had infiltrated a right-wing militia group... the Nebraska Liberty Defense.<eos> Six months in, and it was mostly just talk on their part, so Michael and I were told to expedite things by giving them the blueprints to the federal building in Omaha that they had talked so much about.<eos> Ah, well, we were in over our heads.<eos> Before we knew what happened, it was too late.<eos> The guilt sent Michael down a spiral.<eos> And you?
If we think we can make...<eos> - Do not backtrack now!<eos> - I'm not backtracking!<eos> All right?<eos> I'm trying to find a foothold because you keep overreacting.<eos> You keep making rules.<eos> You tell me to walk away.<eos> You tell me to come back, and I do it.<eos> I do it every single time... because I love you.<eos> And this time...
That one.<eos> Senator Haas had this to say when asked for comment.<eos> Special Agent Alex Parrish is the real hero.<eos> I was simply doing my job.<eos> Is that a message to voters?<eos> I'm not gonna politicize today's events.<eos> Alex, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, we've been going over Miranda's timeline, all right?<eos> Her entire week.
Don't they still teach you that at the Academy?<eos> Looks like we're here.<eos> I'm sorry that I don't have any milk.<eos> I read this article about all the, uh, antibiotics and hormones that they give the cows.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> We just want to know what you saw, Mr. Walker.<eos> Well, there was a man, but I couldn't see his face.<eos> Why didn't you come forward last week?<eos> Well, I thought the man was probably an employee, most likely my replacement.<eos> Your replacement?
The data-storage system is the same as the one they used in the S.E.G. building.<eos> Right, but why would they leave it here?<eos> Because it was easier just to swipe the decks clean.<eos> Well, that sounds just like the Warners' M.O., doesn't it?<eos> One of them.<eos> Fraud, prostitution.<eos> Who knew private equity would be this exciting?<eos> - You forgot murder.<eos> - Okay, what do you need from me?<eos> The truth.

Patrick broke into Kate's desk that night.<eos> He was trying to get rid of the bank statement that proved he set up an illegal account in S.E.G.'s name.<eos> I don't like where you're going with this.<eos> It gets worse.<eos> Melanie erased the security footage from the night of the party.<eos> They're both trying to cover up their tracks.<eos> What does that tell you?<eos> I am so sorry, Eric.<eos> I swear the only thing I knew about was "madame Melanie"...<eos> Not... not the house, the fraud, or the statement.
Okay, bye.<eos> While conducting an internal review, we discovered a rogue employee who had circumvented our internal procedures to commit bank fraud.<eos> I'm notifying you and turning over those files.<eos> Well, something stinks.<eos> Sounds like a lawyer coached you.<eos> You realize this is solid motive for Kate's murder.<eos> Why do you think I'm here?<eos> Let me know if there's anything else you need.<eos> Who'd he throw under the bus?<eos> His brother.
Inhale.<eos> I love that.<eos> Go ahead and tighten that core.<eos> Really open your chakras up.<eos> Yes.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Now let's move into downward dog.<eos> Go ahead and dig those feet into that mat.<eos> You might want to stay in down dog, Melanie.<eos> On your stomach, hands behind your back.
Yeah. Yeah, I do.<eos> Patrick thinks we've turned our backs on him.<eos> He turned his back on us.<eos> After what he's done, he's lucky that's all I'm doing.<eos> He would never hurt Kate.<eos> You think you know what he would and wouldn't do - because he's your son.<eos> - He's made mistakes, but if he's guilty of anything, it's poor judgment.<eos> What about blackmail?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Right around the time.
You know I do, mother.<eos> Might I ask you what it is?<eos> I'm gonna get thrown in jail.<eos> [ knock on door ] yes?<eos> Good morning, your honor. Mr. Castle, you can't be in here.<eos> And yet here I am.<eos> Your honor, I was made a fool of yesterday on the stand.<eos> I have a reputation to protect, so I would like...<eos> A do-over?<eos> A do-over.

- Get the hell out of here.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Jemma Moore on the line, sir.<eos> When the next Shaw leaks drops in two days time, you're buying.<eos> Ma'am, I apologize.<eos> I will leave you two be.<eos> What's this about Thomas Shaw?<eos> Peter can explain everything.<eos> Un otro, por favor.<eos> - Una margarita, por favor.
And you shouldn't judge.<eos> Thanks to me, you always had weed for your stupid weekend dinner parties or a gram for your shitty bachelorette thing.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> But the trick... is to stay alive long enough to enjoy the fruits of this labor.<eos> In this business, your shelf life is only so long.<eos> I knew this day would come.<eos> People have been trying to do this since Sinaloa.<eos> Hola, buenas.<eos> How much?<eos> A thousand.
I think I might be pregnant again.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Ay, gracias.<eos> The men I knew before treated me like shit, but Güero... I felt like he saw me, protected me.<eos> So what if he was a drug runner?<eos> If you came from where I come from, you'd have done the same damn thing.<eos> It was like... heroin.<eos> I wanted it to last forever.<eos> I know that a lot of you hear the word "cartel" and think drugs and guns, but for me, being with Güero was the first time I felt connected to someone.<eos> On our first Christmas,
Hey, guys, did you hear this?<eos> In his last delivery up north, he landed on a strip of rock so small, he nearly killed himself and the reception crew.<eos> Hey, you know, I've had a good run.<eos> We all got to die sometime.<eos> Speak for yourself, man, I go a son.<eos> Your son would thank us.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Hey, sírvanse por favor.<eos> I'd like to thank you all for your loyalty, friendship, your hard work.<eos> To my family.
I'm dying to hear if Natasha's estrogen patch is making a difference.<eos> I saw her Wednesday.<eos> It's not.<eos> Hey, you almost done back there?<eos> - Just making some room!<eos> - You know what?<eos> I am so happy to do this for you.<eos> I love you way more than my beer making kit...<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> ...the wooden tennis racket. Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.<eos> I don't know, the cowboy hat.<eos> The brown one.
I am not getting on a plane with you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You eat a grilled cheese sandwich and you can barely make it to the couch.<eos> Nothing like a grilled cheese nap.<eos> I don't want you flying around in a little plane, either.<eos> Well, it's kind of my life's dream, but if you want me to stop, I'll do it for you.<eos> I had a bad dream last night.<eos> I think that this retirement thing - is making me very scared. ‭<eos> Join the club.<eos> Just not my country club.
See?<eos> Look, it's cute.<eos> You know,<eos> - shabby chic.<eos> - I don't really care where we are as long as we're all together.<eos> Here's to moving on.<eos> - And Steph getting engaged.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Again.<eos> And to bargain-bin decorating.
- Nedley.<eos> Say no more.<eos> Bosses are the worst.<eos> Also, I'm scared mine might be dead.<eos> Oh, kidding.<eos> Are you sure you're OK?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> At least I'm not the only one who wasn't invited to the party.<eos> Makes me feel better.<eos> What party?
It was fabulous!<eos> - Oh.<eos> - You've been so busy<eos> - reconnecting with Wynonna.<eos> - Ignoring your boyfriend...<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Champ and I are,<eos> - are over.<eos> For real this time.
How do I know you didn't double back to mess with the body?<eos> Yeah, you're awfully interested in me and my sister.<eos> Maybe I should be grilling the shit out of you.<eos> Maybe you're the crazy one.<eos> You of all people should know better than to try to make me question my sanity.<eos> I just killed someone!<eos> It was him or you.<eos> A foldrol az eg a kovek.<eos> What were you shooting at out there?<eos> The Stone Witch.
Constance Clootie?<eos> Funny how the woman that you were looking for happens to find you. Here.<eos> Your Murder House's reception is balls!<eos> En vagyok a feltamadas.<eos> - After she made me ageless...<eos> - Ageless?<eos> !<eos> She stuck me at the bottom of an old well<eos> - to spend my immortality...<eos> - Immorta...?
Don't worry, I'm not dead.<eos> Just visiting.<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> You are standing in the middle of Main Street, so, you know...<eos> I must say, I do love the irony of your job.<eos> You watching children, keeping them safe, keeping them close.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have an opportunity for you.<eos> A romantic adventure to save the man you once loved.<eos> You?
Well, if you're looking for someone, simply use your magic.<eos> Having trouble, are we?<eos> Magic's a little tricky down here, isn't it, darling?<eos> Let's sit down and be civilized.<eos> The way in is here?<eos> So, what, the gates of hell are in my house?<eos> As was the stone of Excalibur.<eos> The pirate has a knack for targeting real estate with hidden value.<eos> Basement door?<eos> Basement door.
If he's not moving, I'm not, either.<eos> If he tries to steal this thing, I'll give a shout.<eos> For God's sake, Rumple, it's a dagger, not a dragon.<eos> Don't be scared of it.<eos> I'm scared because our son is dying.<eos> He should be with us, not some village nursemaid.<eos> I didn't spend our last gold coin on a knife to slice the roast at his wake.<eos> Bae only has a couple of hours left.<eos> Let's spend that time doing something to help him, something... something brave.<eos> For once.
I don't know much about deals, but... if I can save my son's life, I will trade anything.<eos> They should be back by now.<eos> They all look so lost.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> Get your hand off that squiggly little thing.<eos> I'm not here to fight.<eos> Yeah, well, perhaps I am.<eos> Oh, even when I'm here to talk about a deal.<eos> A deal?
No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Th-That's it.<eos> I mean, I didn't.<eos> W-We don't have a second-born child.<eos> We just have to make sure we never do.<eos> Because you sold them!<eos> You sold our future.<eos> No.<eos> Our family.
And then, Butterfingers, you dropped it.<eos> Insane, after all that work.<eos> And I couldn't figure out why an image of your wife would affect you so strongly.<eos> So I did a little digging and a little thinking, and I realized you weren't trying to conjure an image of her, were you?<eos> You were trying to figure out where your son went.<eos> You asked the crystal ball to show you your child, didn't you?<eos> - So...<eos> - No, no.<eos> This is an image of your child...<eos> Your next child.
Carter.<eos> My dear fellow.<eos> Long time no see.<eos> Where have you been hiding yourself?<eos> Here and there.<eos> I've been doing some research.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Well... I bought this in a coffee house in town.<eos> Hmm. Looks like someone's stealing from your dig.<eos> Hmm. Not the first time.
- Oh, er, finder's fee.<eos> Really, not necessary. Thank you.<eos> Carter, you'll have to forgive me.<eos> Timmy's birthday waits for no man.<eos> - Course.<eos> - And thank you again.<eos> Carter. Good luck.<eos> - Where's Selim?<eos> - He go to work.<eos> Not for Davis?
Carter, you'll have to forgive me.<eos> Timmy's birthday waits for no man.<eos> - Course.<eos> - And thank you again.<eos> Carter. Good luck.<eos> - Where's Selim?<eos> - He go to work.<eos> Not for Davis?<eos> No, didn't you hear?<eos> For the English Lord on the hills.
- It's...<eos> - I have to know how sure you are.<eos> How sure I am?<eos> I have traced his family from the exodus in Amarna through to the colonisation at Luxor. The reburial...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Not that, not your head.<eos> I don't give a damn about that.<eos> In your heart... in your belly.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Like a white elixir.
Where are we to dig?<eos> Here. Under the cliffs.<eos> Not here? Lord Carnarvon feels that we'd be better served keeping off the beaten track.<eos> And... do you think that too?<eos> He's my patron.<eos> He's the one man who's had faith in me, Selim.<eos> I have to listen to him. And in any case, he may very well be right.<eos> It makes more sense, after all.<eos> Mr Carter, what is it you think we are to find?<eos> A royal tomb, Selim.
He says he can deliver them this afternoon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Did I do something wrong?<eos> - How do you mean?<eos> I don't know. I just... ever since I got here, nobody seems that friendly any more.<eos> Yes.<eos> They think you're British.<eos> - Seven.<eos> Has anyone got anything at all?<eos> (SILENCE)
Knew you were the right man for the job.<eos> MAN: I've never heard of this Tutankhamun.<eos> If I'm right, that would mean that he is buried here.<eos> Thought about you a lot during the war.<eos> What was happening.<eos> Whether you were all right.<eos> LORD CARNARVON: It's not safe here any more.<eos> My daughter's here, for God's sake.<eos> What is it you think we are to find?<eos> A royal tomb.
Please, Mr Carter. You may proceed.<eos> LORD CARNARVON: Quite brilliant, I'd say.<eos> But to be completely honest, I can't take all the credit.<eos> It was Maspero that recommended Carter to me.<eos> My predecessor's death was a... great loss to scholarship.<eos> - Such a man of letters.<eos> - Mm, indeed.<eos> Even if his colonial sympathies sometimes led him to imprudence.<eos> A royal tomb, gentlemen.<eos> - A royal tomb.

Seth, Nephthys, Osiris and Isis were born.<eos> That's rather a beautiful story.<eos> It is, isn't it?<eos> And then, of course, Seth becomes jealous of his brother and murders Osiris.<eos> It's Cain and Abel all over again.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Funny how the same stories come round and round.<eos> What are we going to tell your father?<eos> About what?<eos> About us.
I know.<eos> Mind out.<eos> Let me through.<eos> Let's go inside.<eos> Well, you've heard the news, and it's far from ideal.<eos> But we keep going.<eos> We all keep going.<eos> What about the money?<eos> Let me worry about that.<eos> Right. Back to work.
That if you deny them the story that you gave the Times, they will simply print their own!<eos> "Sources close to the dig report that Lord Carnarvon, whose fortune funds the excavation, intends Tutankhamun's mummy to be transported back to Britain, and to be put on display at the British Museum!"<eos> This, when the bloody Arabs are just itching for a fight.<eos> Winlock, would you... would you kindly excuse us?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you know what damage this causes us?<eos> Causes me?<eos> Well, we issue a correction.<eos> Where?<eos> In the Times?
It's a hedgehog, you see?<eos> I remember when I saw this for the first time.<eos> He was so proud.<eos> His first find.<eos> And now he's gone.<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> How can you be gone?<eos> It doesn't make the slightest bit of sense.<eos> When do you leave?<eos> In an hour.
Well, I can be as humble as the next man.<eos> You know, if I didn't apologise if we didn't get access to that tomb again...<eos> Well, then nothing would have to come to an end.<eos> For how long?<eos> A lifetime, maybe.<eos> So long as it remains unfinished we're here.<eos> Aren't we?<eos> And out here anything is possible.<eos> And for years now, I thought it was the tomb.<eos> The tomb.
Thank you.<eos> Winlock.<eos> What?<eos> Wake up.<eos> Come and see this.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Sir, turn this way.<eos> This way, sir.<eos> Just for a moment, sir.<eos> One second...
David Biel, a resident of the Yesler Mission Men's Shelter.<eos> Lately, he's been raising them money at Third and Cherry dressed like this, ringing a bell.<eos> Any idea why someone rang his?<eos> No.<eos> Could be a robbery gone bad.<eos> Dead Santa, the night before Christmas?<eos> No shortage of potential vision triggers.<eos> Maybe I'll get something.<eos> Yeah, shoot me an email.<eos> Sorry.
And by canvass, I mean have sex with.<eos> Ooh.<eos> I've got some information about the Santa Claus murder.<eos> - This girl said I should come in.<eos> - What girl?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Some pale Blondie.<eos> Huh.<eos> Let's hear it.<eos> _
It's so incredibly tragic.<eos> Can you think of anyone who might have wanted to kill Jordan?<eos> He was an intense young man.<eos> That could cause friction.<eos> Can we get access to dailies?<eos> There might be something in them that speaks to motive.<eos> Here's the online password.<eos> We archive every take.<eos> Anything else you need, just ask...<eos> My assistant.

To my training, and to your extracurricular duties.<eos> I mean, you're really plowing through your list.<eos> Mr. Du Clark, Dr. Lockett is anxious to show you something.<eos> Tell him I'll be down there when I can.<eos> Uh, down where?<eos> I thought this was the lowest level.<eos> We got a lab in Tacoma.<eos> - Tacoma's, what, 40 miles away? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Seems like a good goal for the week.<eos> To the treadmill!
You know, I... I didn't see a slap in here.<eos> - Interesting choice.<eos> - It just felt honest.<eos> I'll see you around.<eos> Huh, looks like we know who's gonna be front-and-center on the Season Four poster.<eos> Thanks, but I'm happy in my current job.<eos> It was all about finding my motivation.<eos> Have they posted the new dailies?<eos> I wanna see how Starlee played my scene with Wyatt.<eos> - Your scene?
Welcome to Tacoma.<eos> Ah. It's okay, Doc.<eos> I just wanted show him a feeding.<eos> - Mind doing the honors?<eos> - Of course.<eos> We get our brains from a medical testing facility.<eos> Not exactly the freshest supply, but then again, our patrons aren't what you would call choosy.<eos> Did you ever see a zombie, Major?<eos> Yeah, you know, I see them all the time.<eos> Real zombies.
I can't do that, luv.<eos> The last time I saw her, it felt like she knew something bad was gonna happen.<eos> But that doesn't mean that it did.<eos> We both know that this is a war, right?<eos> That means anything can happen.<eos> I just miss her so much.<eos> - Those are my test results?<eos> - Huh? You've got a shite poker face.<eos> Even for a grad student.<eos> Ex-grad student.
Yeah!<eos> And beautiful.<eos> Oh, my gosh, you are so good.<eos> You are a very talented dancer.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome!<eos> Is that why you're always traveling?<eos> You on tour?<eos> I went to go live in Iceland with my granny.<eos> In Iceland?
- I'm playing the part, darling.<eos> - No, darling,<eos> - you're mincing.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> Donnie, do you have any gay friends?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Science commonly holds the belief that 5 to 10 percent<eos> - of your male friends are gay.<eos> - Not in Bailey Downs.
Wait, wait.<eos> - What?<eos> Look at this.<eos> See the mat?<eos> That's a pressure plate bomb.<eos> You step on that,<eos> - the whole place goes up.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> Kinda makes you wonder what she's hiding.<eos> Herself.
Oh, shit. Bioluminescence?<eos> Green fluorescent proteins. They must be using them as markers to track gene expression.<eos> So the bot's introducing foreign DNA?<eos> And it seems like, because the host died, it's - all congregating in the tumour. - I bet that's why Leekie had one.<eos> It's some kind of gene therapy delivery system.<eos> Could be changing Sarah's DNA.<eos> Sarah?<eos> Sarah?<eos> Over here.<eos> Behind you.
I'm not that choosy this time in the morning.<eos> Here we are.<eos> All right, how much do I owe you, honey?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Why are you going through Felix's stuff?<eos> Wow, you are protective for a drug dealer.<eos> - You don't see that very often.<eos> - Adele... - It's kind of weird. - You should see how crisp it looks outside.<eos> It's like...<eos> - Oh, shit.
Why don't you join us, Mr. Hendrix? Yeah, of course.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll get myself cleaned up a bit.<eos> I will continue to be hostess.<eos> Okay, honey.<eos> Abort!<eos> Abort!<eos> - Heavens, Donnie, what is it?<eos> - Police. Living room. - With Helena.<eos> - For this?
I'll be there soon.<eos> Susan's en route.<eos> You call me when you're done with the hairdresser.<eos> She's an esthetician.<eos> We need to keep the situation under control, Fee.<eos> Just promise me that Adele is not gonna walk in.<eos> It's a moot point; she went home.<eos> Felix, when this is all done, bring her back.<eos> I want the whole family here for Ma.<eos> Everyone.
Is that bleach?<eos> - Are you out of your mind?<eos> ! - Benjamin!<eos> - Thought I smelled trouble.<eos> - You've just destroyed yourself<eos> - you stupid girl!<eos> - Sarah, you want to tell us what you're doing?<eos> Kendall's driver's not answering.<eos> I found her cigarettes in a pool of blood.<eos> Bathroom!
Born to industry, drawn to Darwin and early eugenical thought.<eos> He used his resources to essentially create a secret scientific society.<eos> Percy sought to bring science to the task of breeding a better human.<eos> You're sleeping in his very room.<eos> Over a century ago, he built the facilities downstairs.<eos> I built on top of him.<eos> And now,<eos> Evie Cho builds on top of me.<eos> I gave up everything to continue his legacy:<eos> Ethan, you.
All right? The only people you should be talking to are Alison and me.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Got it, yeah.<eos> In the meantime, we're gonna be collecting affidavits from community members and friends.<eos> I mean, the bail hearing is basically about just proving you're not a flight risk.<eos> See, we're in good hands.<eos> Hey!<eos> What's so important?<eos> I think Siobhan's about to do something rash.<eos> In the car.
Donnie, are you okay? What...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You remember that Neolution guy?<eos> He's in my cell.<eos> With a shank. - A what?<eos> - A shank.<eos> A shiv, it's what we call a knife in here.<eos> It's a sharpened toothbrush, okay?<eos> Listen. He says if you don't tell them what they want to know, he's gonna stick it in my brain<eos> through my eye.
- Sarah.<eos> - What happened?<eos> OK, OK, OK.<eos> Oh, Rachel's gone mad.<eos> - Where's Cosima?<eos> - I sent her up-island with Charlotte, to a boat.<eos> Where?<eos> How do I get to them?<eos> Sarah, Rachel's taken the cure.<eos> The whole cell line.
Is that news that you've misplaced your toothbrush?<eos> Zinger!<eos> No.<eos> No, you know how today we're heading into the land of the giants to offer them the jewel of Valencia in exchange for joining our quest to save princess Isabella?<eos> Yes, we discussed it last night in great detail.<eos> There's no need for your clunky exposition.<eos> Well, I have managed to trade the jewel for something even better than an army.<eos> You traded the jewel?<eos> Yep.<eos> For a dragon.
Who goes there?<eos> Oh, thank goodness.<eos> Giants.<eos> I've been looking for you everywhere!<eos> State your business, wee man.<eos> I'm Galavant.<eos> I need an army, and I'm told your people are among the fiercest warriors in the land.<eos> "Among"?<eos> We are giants, with fists the size of pumpkins.<eos> Pumpkins, good.
Oh, wow.<eos> *Let's go and pop a few giants*<eos> *Kick some gargantuan butt*<eos> *Hack out those huge knobby kneecaps*<eos> *And make them keep their big mouths shut*<eos> *Someone* *has got to cut them down to size*<eos> *Someone* *And we're the ones who will climb them*<eos> *And slap their fat faces*<eos> *Let's mess a whole bunch of dwarves up*<eos> *Stomp on those wee little tots*
There's something you should see.<eos> Here we are.<eos> You're farming opium?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Aah! This hurts so much!<eos> Queenie!<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I think I felt something.<eos> Like a cramp.
And it wasn't my idea to have it this early.<eos> Look, I am not showing up to your wedding all bloated and looking like shit.<eos> I need time to recuperate.<eos> Uh, weeks?<eos> I plan on drinking a lot.<eos> I found it.<eos> Where did Monica get the bread for a wedding dress?<eos> This was back when her parents had a little money.<eos> And they approved of the first wedding.<eos> First?
Shut up, Kermit!<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> - Yeah, Moon! Oh, Yeah!<eos> - Oh!<eos> Pound it!<eos> Pound it!<eos> Pound it!<eos> Pound!<eos> No!<eos> Pound!
Osteoporosis doesn't slow her down at all.<eos> - And you were right-- - Aah!<eos> Hey, easy!<eos> What about free love and all that "Rolling Stone" crap?<eos> Frankie is mine!<eos> Oh, Queenie, nobody belongs to anybody!<eos> - He is mine!<eos> - All right, stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> To the Pit.
- Yes, Chief.<eos> - Dwayne, keep an eye on Eloise.<eos> - Don't worry, Chief, I won't let her out of my sight.<eos> Yes, of that I have no doubt.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Eloise's agent's confirmed they were speaking at the time Zoe was murdered.<eos> - We're still waiting for phone records to back it up.<eos> - Thanks, Florence.<eos> So, security here at the site.<eos> Swamp here at the back.
Why?<eos> That is the question.<eos> - A mobile phone number?<eos> - She called it two days ago.<eos> Zoe was writing an article called Life In The Industry.<eos> The drugs, of course!<eos> The drugs, the ones Eloise had!<eos> - Excellent, JP.<eos> Get them tested for prints.<eos> Top priority!
He didn't turn up because of me and my stupid wobble.<eos> Thank you so much, Minister.<eos> Mint?<eos> Oh, no, thank you.<eos> Commissioner, would you like a mint?<eos> No.<eos> - He didn't want a mint. - Shh!<eos> MUSIC: Many Rivers To Cross by Jimmy Cliff<eos> ♪ Many rivers to cross... ♪ But I can't seem to find<eos> ♪ My way over

I'd appreciate you keep this between us, though, for them.<eos> And, yeah, a little bit for me.<eos> [Sniffles] I don't care.<eos> You do what you want.<eos> I just want to go.<eos> Go where?<eos> Carol.<eos> Away.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
?<eos> Balloons?<eos> You going to a party, little girl?<eos> Can I keep them, please?<eos> It's just...<eos> Let me keep them.<eos> Say please again, little girl.<eos> Please.<eos> Yeah.<eos> One more time.
Sorry.<eos> I shouldn't ask.<eos> You want to slide that one back in, period.<eos> This is big, Gregory.<eos> It's huge.<eos> And I won't forget it.<eos> I really, really appreciate this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, we're gonna go through the place and take half of everything you have.<eos> But only half.
Now, we're gonna go through the place and take half of everything you have.<eos> But only half.<eos> Take this to the Negan truck, okay?<eos> Exeunt, gentlemen!<eos> Get to work.<eos> Oh, and take the painting.<eos> One last thing, Gregory.<eos> Could I just get a kneel out of you?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Kneel.
People told me you killed walkers and a car... with a tractor?<eos> I couldn't sit by and watch.<eos> Not again.<eos> So I guess I sat and did something.<eos> You're supposed to take it easy.<eos> It wasn't hard.<eos> It wasn't the first time.<eos> There was this boy in high school.<eos> You ran over the boy?<eos> His car.
Hey.<eos> Thank you for the beach and... everything out there.<eos> I mean, you saved my life.<eos> You did.<eos> I mean, I don't know if your grandma totally approves, but...<eos> My mom would've.<eos> She showed me the way.<eos> A way.<eos> I was trying to show Rachel.<eos> The little girl?
It got screwed up.<eos> We're on it now, but it's a mess out there.<eos> And whose job was that?<eos> a pack and a tent...<eos> Aw, damn.<eos> I thought they packed this up tight.<eos> Ah, no worries.<eos> Plenty more where this came from.<eos> Right?<eos> Son of a bitch!
Is he still around?<eos> There's some things I wanna add to his list before he goes out.<eos> The kids need something to write with -- pens, pencils.<eos> Are you already president?<eos> Mm.<eos> I've just been talking to people.<eos> Jesus left this morning.<eos> He told me to tell you, but I-I forgot.<eos> Okay.<eos> Next time.
You should go, too.<eos> I should.<eos> I don't want anyone else coming around or even knowing where I am.<eos> If you somehow see anyone we know, tell them I'm gone.<eos> Do that for me please.<eos> Never meant for you to see me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hot date?
Teach me how to ride a bike.<eos> I never had a sweet sixteen.<eos> Could throw me one after the wedding.<eos> Has anyone seen Carl?<eos> Uh, yeah, he left a half hour ago.<eos> At 6:00 in the morning?<eos> Did he say why?<eos> Find somewhere to sleep without a screaming infant, maybe?<eos> - All right, kid, let's go.<eos> - No way.

What would he do?<eos> Pretend to reach for his wallet?<eos> - Frank owns a wallet?<eos> - I can hear you.<eos> Those are my boots.<eos> Hey!<eos> Get used to it.<eos> Hey, Debs.<eos> Where you off to?<eos> School.
How long till Frank balls?<eos> I give it two days.<eos> One.<eos> If that.<eos> If I win, you have to go down on me every night for a week.<eos> And if you lose?<eos> Same deal.<eos> You drive a hard bargain, Gallagher.<eos> - He didn't buy any of it?<eos> - Not one word.
Oh, there she is, here.<eos> Put that out, put that out.<eos> Look at this!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> She heard you laughing and wanted to say hi.<eos> Hey, lady.<eos> She is a beauty.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hello, lady.<eos> - Oh. - Her neck, her neck.
And then butt-fucked by a flock of Canadian geese.<eos> - How much?<eos> - How...<eos> What?<eos> How much what?<eos> How much money, dumbshit?<eos> The fuck are you talking about?<eos> Hypothetically speaking.<eos> Say a fella just got canned.<eos> Eh, like an hour ago.
- Yes. Wait a minute.<eos> Artie, that's it!<eos> It...<eos> Okay, it's-it's a high-pitched squeak.<eos> What-what-what did I miss?<eos> I don't know, but I love it when he's excited like this, Artie.<eos> Uh... Ms. Ryan?<eos> Ms. Ryan, I-I wanted to apologize again for barging in.<eos> Oh, that's all right, Artie.<eos> This time.
Write what down?<eos> These stories.<eos> Well, maybe somebody already did.<eos> Nobody did.<eos> No, somebody did.<eos> I put it all down.<eos> Like in a diary?<eos> No. Like in a book.<eos> I wrote a book.<eos> About us.
These stories.<eos> Well, maybe somebody already did.<eos> Nobody did.<eos> No, somebody did.<eos> I put it all down.<eos> Like in a diary?<eos> No. Like in a book.<eos> I wrote a book.<eos> About us.<eos> All the true stories.
I know you know.<eos> What do I do?<eos> The lawyers are waiting for our go-ahead.<eos> They want to push for an injunction.<eos> Dad, Mom said I could play another game before I start all my homework.<eos> First you're gonna tell me what happened to your eye.<eos> Then you can play your game.<eos> I already told you.<eos> Can you turn it on?<eos> The truth this time.
Let's do this discreetly, not cuff him in full view.<eos> Discreetly?<eos> This scumbag killed my friend.<eos> His ass is mine.<eos> Senator Harris, could you come with us, sir, please?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> I'm having a great day.<eos> But you, you're under arrest.<eos> Under arrest?<eos> For what?
Can I ask you something?<eos> Do you want to be a detective or not?<eos> Maybe.<eos> What about the sergeant's exam?<eos> After law school, I swore I'd never take another damn exam.<eos> So, what, you just want to ride in an RMP for the next 20 years?<eos> Didn't say that.<eos> Could you be a little more vague, Reagan?<eos> I like being on patrol, Eddie.<eos> For now.

Yeah, Jenna. Tell us more.<eos> What could I say?<eos> I was supposed to be writing last night, and instead, I slept with Luke.<eos> Idea Bin was my big shot, and I couldn't mess it up by getting distracted with Luke drama.<eos> It was no big deal.<eos> Oh, so it sucked. No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It was great.<eos> It's just that no one should read too much into it, you know?<eos> No, not really.
- Ooh.<eos> - You got a hot date, hon?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Luke had a date?<eos> Or worse, he didn't, and he was trying to hurt me.<eos> Wait. Would that be worse?<eos> Ugh, how could avoiding drama be so much drama?<eos> Rude.<eos> I can't believe you invited<eos> Hamil-taint to my birthday.
Jenna who?<eos> Okay, I have everyone's assignment except...<eos> Jenna's.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Paper?<eos> What, did you write it with a quill by candlelight?<eos> Why don't you just fax it to me while you're at it, huh?<eos> Maybe the fax will make a comeback.<eos> - Yeah, and pagers.<eos> - Tiddlywinks.
I knew it would be hard to convince my parents to let me move in with Luke, but I was praying they'd say yes, eventually, at least.<eos> Jenna... this is such great news!<eos> - For real?<eos> - Yes!<eos> This is going to make everything so much simpler.<eos> This house is way too full right now.<eos> There will be one fewer person showering here every day.<eos> I think this deserves a toast.<eos> I could have been offended at how excited my parents were to get me out of the house, but I chose instead to focus on the fact that I was totally getting away with something.<eos> To... - Jenna and Luke. - Hello?
My mood was nothing a bowl of ice cream couldn't take care of.<eos> Rocky road, take me away.<eos> Okay, it's nothing a hot shower couldn't fix.<eos> [bleep].<eos> Hi. This is Tamara Kaplan.<eos> I'm calling you back about your offer.<eos> How much did you say you're willing to pay me?<eos> And that's for one night or the whole weekend?<eos> Okay.<eos> What hotel?
Thought you were getting some rest.<eos> So did I.<eos> Yeah, it's always tough to sleep after a splinter.<eos> Kind of messes with your clock.<eos> That's a joke.<eos> You ever see weird things when you splinter?<eos> Yeah, all the time.<eos> Colors, lights, memories.<eos> You ever see a person?<eos> Person?
Anything that might indicate there was another time traveler in that room with her.<eos> The blood has washed away.<eos> Go to him.<eos> The memory of tomorrow.<eos> - We found something.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Some sort of pentaquark signature.<eos> Another tether?<eos> - Anchored where?<eos> - Here, to this facility, now.
I can't access it from here.<eos> Doctor...<eos> Jones.<eos> Doctor... you did this to me.<eos> The machine... you...<eos> you put me in there.<eos> What the hell is that thing?<eos> An early volunteer.<eos> He called himself Marshal.<eos> Volunteer?
- You're shitting me.<eos> How do you know it was The Witness?<eos> Because I've seen him before.<eos> After the Night Room, when they were holding me captive, they had me drink that red tea, and he was there.<eos> Cass, that stuff's dangerous.<eos> What else haven't you told me?<eos> When I saw The Witness in the hotel room...<eos> Yeah, when he looked like Aaron?<eos> And then he changed his appearance to you.<eos> To me, why?
Whoo-hoo. Beautiful.<eos> Oh. So that piece of shit is gonna stop this freak show?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Hey, it's Deacon.<eos> Who's there?<eos> How'd you get in here?<eos> This is a restricted facility.<eos> Army personnel only.<eos> - Army.
We can pick him up at the 21st.<eos> - Cuff him.<eos> - Get up.<eos> Don't say anything until I get there, Dean.<eos> - Hands behind your back.<eos> - Shut it down.<eos> Copy that.<eos> I told the detective there was a gun.<eos> I don't know what more I could do.<eos> So that night...
Well, at first blush, clinically, classic psychopath.<eos> Prey on the weak.<eos> All these women are marginalized by age or race and physically or emotionally removed from any support.<eos> Well, we know from phone records four of these women knew each other, and from there, we discovered they met in a chat room, compared notes.<eos> They agreed to meet with him, and as best we can tell, confront him about his methods.<eos> So my question is:<eos> how could he have managed to pull them in for more rounds if they were already skeptical?<eos> Cancer diagnosis has so much uncertainty.<eos> People are looking for a guide through the process, someone they can trust.<eos> A savior.
25,000 dollars' worth.<eos> And I wouldn't be charged with anything?<eos> You're the grieving brother.<eos> Why would we charge you with anything?<eos> In your review of Dr. Reybold's books, you found no evidence he billed any insurance companies<eos> - for these treatments.<eos> - No. Well, who did pay for these treatments?<eos> Dr. Reybold himself.<eos> From his personal account.<eos> Personal.
Can you do that?<eos> Maybe.<eos> If you put me on the stand.<eos> All three victims were in contact with each other, comparing notes.<eos> We know this from their phone records.<eos> After their December 10th meeting with Dr. Reybold, they agreed to an experimental treatment which, in actuality, was simply twice the usual dose of chemo.<eos> The following week, he upped it to three times the amount.<eos> By the time they wound up in the hospital, it was at seven times.<eos> Because they confronted him about what he did, and he was afraid of being exposed.<eos> Objection.

No.<eos> How gratifying would it be to help convict Dr. Reybold?<eos> It would be very gratifying.<eos> - No further questions.<eos> - For all his victims.<eos> I said no further questions.<eos> You answered exactly as I expected you to.<eos> Redirect?<eos> What other victims are you referring to, Sergeant Voight?<eos> Objection.
Now, I get how you feel, I do.<eos> But there is nothing that we can do for her.<eos> Alright!<eos> So we stay inside.<eos> Alright.<eos> End of discussion.<eos> I can't believe the Doc.<eos> She was always...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Six months now.
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Back up, people.<eos> This is not a petting zoo.<eos> Who are you supposed to be? Shaka Zulu?<eos> In charge, that's what.<eos> Until the army guy comes back.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> You're real tough.<eos> Try me, ass face.<eos> Get out of my freakin' way... now.<eos> Another time.
It's a mess.<eos> Are we being deployed, major?<eos> Negative.<eos> What are we supposed to do?<eos> Well, the Pacific Northwest seems safe enough.<eos> The ash cloud from that volcano is probably gonna darken the skies for a little while...<eos> Shouldn't you people be focused on the emergency?<eos> These are specific orders, ma'am.<eos> Our buddies are dealing with the situation outside.<eos> Out.

Hey, man. This shit's not working.<eos> We need to stick together.<eos> Keep each other from falling apart.<eos> Hey, that's ok for you but who do the rest of us count on?<eos> Relapsed vampires?<eos> The asshole that killed my wife?<eos> You see what's happening.<eos> - They're scared, I get that.<eos> - They're rats in a cage. It's only a matter of time before they turn on each other.<eos> Or you.
The marines?<eos> They're all dead.<eos> Look, you walk out there, maybe we're all dead too by the time you get back.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> We need to figure out who Cynthia's killer is.<eos> I need you here.<eos> Please.<eos> The seeds are beginning to pop.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> About Mohamad.
Yeah?<eos> Well, so are you.<eos> You're seriously gonna let me go out there without any weapons?<eos> Go!<eos> Shit.<eos> It should have been me.<eos> At ease, soldier man.<eos> They're never gonna let us out of here, Even with that death stare of yours.<eos> I just let an innocent kid walk to his death because of you.<eos> - Innocent?
Here, let me take a look at that.<eos> You eavesdropping with that thing?<eos> Is that what that is?<eos> You always carry that around?<eos> Hey.<eos> What'retheysaying?<eos> Comeon.<eos> Comeon.<eos> They're going to execute us.<eos> All of us.
- I just- we can't stay like this.<eos> In here, us and them.<eos> Ok.<eos> Then what's the answer?<eos> I don't know the answer, i just- I did what I had to do.<eos> You didn't have to, you chose to.<eos> You just slaughtered their whole group.<eos> Yeah, all those people.<eos> For you.<eos> And you.
In here, us and them.<eos> Ok.<eos> Then what's the answer?<eos> I don't know the answer, i just- I did what I had to do.<eos> You didn't have to, you chose to.<eos> You just slaughtered their whole group.<eos> Yeah, all those people.<eos> For you.<eos> And you.<eos> And you.
Yeah, but...<eos> That's the way the world is now.<eos> Yeah, says you.<eos> I'm sorry, was it a bad idea?<eos> Obviously not. I'm...<eos> I'm just saying...<eos> What?<eos> These were people.<eos> We killed people.<eos> Actual people.
It'll be great.<eos> Fine.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> What do you think, Vanessa?<eos> I think we need to make a decision.<eos> What about a vote?<eos> Well, if my vote means anything my sister used to work at the base as well.<eos> I'm pretty sure she's the one who sent you in to begin with.<eos> Wait, your sister sent the marines?<eos> Something like that.
You go!<eos> You got the gun.<eos> Come on.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Open the door.<eos> Now!<eos> No, not Norman.<eos> It's Gorman.<eos> With a G.
That he's the killer.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What the hell's going on here?<eos> Seriously?<eos> No, think about it, people. Think about it!<eos> I am thinking about it.<eos> He was always accusing everybody else.<eos> It was always somebody else.<eos> Either me or, or Flesh...<eos> And then Mohamad.
I can't do that again...<eos> I'm gonna take another quick look for Gorman...<eos> It's a gong show up there because of that explosion and you got ferals everywhere,<eos> You are gonna have to take point, you ready for that?<eos> Always gotta be last man out, don't' you?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> I'm gonna help Doc with this Gorman idiot again.<eos> Axel, hurry up!<eos> You sure you wanna do this?<eos> Absolutely.
I'm down to my last clip!<eos> Me too!<eos> We fight or die.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bad spot for a camp-out.<eos> Couldn't find a motel.<eos> More ferals will come.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Go where?<eos> Eden.
I'll take it from here, Zorro.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Curiosity killed the cat.<eos> So, today the day we move on?<eos> - Me?<eos> - What's up, sue?<eos> It's not me, it's this place.<eos> I barely slept last night.<eos> I actually dreamt.<eos> The first time in forever.
I will show you.<eos> Yes.<eos> So, first place your hands on the table.<eos> Good.<eos> Now close your eyes.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> And breathe.<eos> Just... breathe.<eos> and... let your thoughts take you back to that time.<eos> To that place.
The newborns don't go back to the resistance.<eos> They're given to Magdalene.<eos> For God knows what.<eos> You have no idea the consequences.<eos> You told us they were safe.<eos> I protected you for nothing.<eos> It was never nothing.<eos> I gave you peace, I gave you comfort and safety,<eos> All this for a very small price to pay.<eos> Small price?
Uh, yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> We're safer together.<eos> We could combine forces.<eos> Combine goals.<eos> The camp that Sheema's being held at is on the way to Denver.<eos> In fact, Dylan might be there.<eos> - Mohamad.<eos> - No, seriously.<eos> They rounded up people from Seattle to this camp.<eos> Kids, too.
All this talk of trust.<eos> Well, if you can't give any you sure as hell don't deserve it.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, get out.<eos> Wait for me. Outside.<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> I have been summoned.<eos> Why?<eos> Dmitri blames me.<eos> The woman.
If anything it would have been justice.<eos> Back in the hospital, when Brendan locked us up in those cells, he was gonna banish me.<eos> Sam confessed but nobody listened.<eos> Everyone thought he was just trying to protect me.<eos> It was a little more than that.<eos> Maybe if I paid more attention, or seen what was right in front of me, maybe Susan would still be alive.<eos> Maybe more.<eos> Sam would have killed you too, eventually.<eos> You're guilty of nothing.<eos> Only him.
Be patient.<eos> Wait for your chance.<eos> As promised.<eos> Mohamad?<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> They didn't hurt you?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I want the boy.<eos> In time.
First thing's first.<eos> We need to get rid of the dark one, Dmitri.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Tomorrow then.<eos> We're on.<eos> My god, what's happening?<eos> And that is why I'm happy to tell you... to tell all of you... that now is finally time!<eos> It is time to strike back at the forces of darkness and take back what is ours!<eos> Our place!<eos> Our people!
- Don't ask me to go with you.<eos> - Sheema. Not if you're leaving.<eos> Look, you don't get it. We're not safe here.<eos> My god!<eos> You are so ungrateful!<eos> I betrayed my friend to save you.<eos> After everything they've given us?<eos> And-and now?<eos> And now, when things are finally about to be alright, you want to go back out there?<eos> On the road?
- Diane is in denial.<eos> Mellie Grant is in your office.<eos> A woman's career is at stake, and we need to know if...<eos> Wait. What?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Mellie Grant is...<eos> I see that.<eos> You wrote a book.<eos> I wrote a book.<eos> A book.

I'm in for the job.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I really have to get myself this view.<eos> Only one way to get this view.<eos> And trust me, it's a bitch.<eos> Hello, Mr. President.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did you know you could get Gettysburger French fries in a bag from the grocery store?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Freedom fries...
Mellie was a great one for all her faults.<eos> I was brilliant at it, but it can't be me anymore.<eos> Betrayal's still there.<eos> Well, he forgave you.<eos> Cyrus.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> You're the new wife.<eos> Anything I say taints your honeymoon.<eos> You need to find your own way in this marriage, Red.<eos> Godspeed.
Text me a nearby address.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> With her.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Yeah, Huck's right.<eos> This guy could be dangerous.<eos> You're more of an office guy.<eos> Then I'll hide behind her, but I'm going.<eos> Fine.<eos> Your funeral.
I could make so many great changes if you would just step back. (chuckling):<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> I'm gonna go to the hotel with Brad.<eos> I'm gonna leave the office in your hands for the rest of the week. Mmm.<eos> You should make as many changes as you'd like.<eos> Oh, there's gonna be changes.<eos> Hey, do you mind?<eos> Personal finances.<eos> NASDAQ's going crazy.<eos> Not the time. Okay.
And the streak will continue.<eos> Looks like they did not get my note to de-romanticize the room.<eos> All right, we need to get rid of these rose petals, and our beach towels shouldn't be kissing.<eos> I'm just gonna check with Nancy at the office.<eos> Put that phone away.<eos> You are on vacation.<eos> Allison is covering.<eos> Let her do her thing. Let us do ours.<eos> Ow! (chuckles)<eos> Why?
Good! Thanks, Dad.<eos> I'll always be the first Fuller on the sign, yeah?<eos> Yeah, of course, Dad.<eos> Okay. Okay, well,<eos> I'm gonna go crack open a bottle of anything but raspberry champagne and watch the game.<eos> See you tomorrow, partner.<eos> (quiet laugh)<eos> Dr. Allison Fuller?<eos> Yep, that's me.<eos> Sorry about the delay.
Evening, JP.<eos> Florence.<eos> Sir.<eos> So, Dwayne was round at yours this evening, then, sir?<eos> Er, yes.<eos> We were, erm...<eos> Well, actually, he was, erm...<eos> - What were you doing?<eos> You were putting up a shelf?<eos> - Painting.
And they were her only drinks?<eos> Yes.<eos> When she arrived, she went straight into her speech.<eos> I served her after she'd finished speaking.<eos> - And where did her glass come from?<eos> - From that table.<eos> - Did someone offer you the glass, sir?<eos> - No.<eos> I chose it myself.<eos> And the bottle?
Fortunately, they were kind enough to tell Caroline about it.<eos> So she commissioned some discrete drilling.<eos> - How much of this is there?<eos> - We don't know, exactly, but we're estimating tens of millions of pounds' worth.<eos> Soon afterwards, our geologist spotted drill holes that weren't theirs.<eos> Then one day, the Tricolor flag appeared on the rock.<eos> - Someone told the French about the emeralds.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And now, those canny Frogs are rewriting history to try to claim Spinner's Rock for themselves.<eos> No offence.
There's something you should see.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It was hidden in the back of the drawer.<eos> 'Lockdown Private Security, hired for the ongoing security of Spinner's Rock...'<eos> That's me.<eos> From yesterday.<eos> In Caroline's office.<eos> - So Caroline's room was bugged?<eos> - Not just hers.
Yet still they snubbed you.<eos> Gave it to some Oxbridge tosser who'd spent his career in Brussels.<eos> Because I'm not up to it?<eos> No.<eos> Because I went to a red brick university and because I speak my mind.<eos> So you came up against a glass ceiling and when you bumped your head, you wanted compensation.<eos> I knew how much the information about the Spinner's Rock emeralds was worth.<eos> So you approached Francois, who probably couldn't believe his luck.<eos> How often have you been giving him information?<eos> Every couple of weeks.
Gives me two hours.<eos> I only have a few minutes left!<eos> We need to split up, cover every reflective surface you can find.<eos> We gotta block his way from going in. Go! Now!<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - Yeah, can it wait?<eos> I'm kind of trying to save your ass here.<eos> You're gonna save me, all right.<eos> I need you to forgive me.<eos> Why?
I forgive her!<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Not in your heart.<eos> I can't move!<eos> Help me.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> Time's up.<eos> I can taste it.<eos> Guilt!
Guilt!<eos> Gross!<eos> Repent, Wynonna Earp. Two hours to find forgiveness from the souls you've hurt.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> Earp, what the hell happened?<eos> She's gone.<eos> And I'm next.<eos> It's Simple.<eos> I take peace maker and right<eos> - between the revenant's eyes...
- Yes.<eos> You're the guiltiest of all, Doc.<eos> But you feel no remorse.<eos> Not like this one.<eos> Search your heart, Wynonna.<eos> Who have you hurt the most?<eos> It's you.<eos> - Wav, of course, it's you. - No! I mean, sure, you've done dumb stuff, but you're my sister, OK?<eos> - I'll always forgive you.<eos> - Not for this.
We're gonna do this the hard way.<eos> The bubblegum sake I imported from Japan!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Oh, that's gross!<eos> - It's unique!<eos> - Try it.<eos> See?<eos> Not-not so bad.<eos> Wav it's OK to just be honest.<eos> For once.
- It's Wynonna.<eos> Your sister, the bag of chaos you live with?<eos> But this is... but Willa's gone.<eos> I'm alive.<eos> Get them.<eos> Dude, I did!<eos> I have!<eos> I killed them so hard.<eos> Sent their creepy asses back where they belong.<eos> Not all of them.
Well, I reckon he knows.<eos> - Fish...<eos> - Vengeance is hollow, Doc.<eos> I think it's time.<eos> You sure you're OK with this?<eos> It was always gonna end this way.<eos> I don't want to live, waiting for either of us to be shot down by the heir.<eos> That's no life.<eos> You're gonna be the one to break this curse, Wynonna.<eos> For all of us.
That's no life.<eos> You're gonna be the one to break this curse, Wynonna.<eos> For all of us.<eos> And I thank you.<eos> I'm gonna count to three.<eos> One.<eos> ♪ Little babies ♪<eos> It's almost time, lovies.<eos> Uncle Bobo is finding you.<eos> All of you.
You can't stop him.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> Listen to me, he's not going to succeed.<eos> We've got this.<eos> This is our Earth.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't know what he is capable of.<eos> I know from being in the Speed Force that the universe is with us, not Zoom.<eos> And if the universe is with us, how could we possibly lose?<eos> Right, guys?
I saw a bird.<eos> Like, a dead bird.<eos> Mercury Labs.<eos> It's under attack.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Allen.<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> Boom.<eos> So how did you know?<eos> - Your real identity?
Everybody cool here?<eos> Should be a piece of cake, right?<eos> - Hey, slugger!<eos> - Hey.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> What's up?<eos> Well, I know you said that what happened to you in the Speed Force changed the way you see things, but you seem very optimistic, you know, with a lot of meta-humans running around tearing up the city.<eos> What, did you see the future in there?<eos> No... not this time.
Oh, I mean, I was just in the right place at the right time.<eos> Proud of you, Wally.<eos> You did good.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> What?<eos> I'm just... I'm proud of you too.<eos> - Soup's on.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Taking out a city full of monsters makes a man hungry.<eos> First, a toast.

Don't race him.<eos> - It's not that easy.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> You just say no.<eos> We find another way to stop him, together, like we always do.<eos> - And do what, Joe?<eos> Just sit around and wait for him to kill somebody else?<eos> Wally?<eos> Iris?<eos> You?
- Yes, it is.<eos> You just say no.<eos> We find another way to stop him, together, like we always do.<eos> - And do what, Joe?<eos> Just sit around and wait for him to kill somebody else?<eos> Wally?<eos> Iris?<eos> You?<eos> No.<eos> No way.
- Of course I want to kill him, Joe.<eos> I want to do a hell of a lot more than just kill him.<eos> I want him to suffer for everything that he's done.<eos> And he's going to.<eos> - Come on, bare.<eos> Think about what you're saying.<eos> - I have to be willing to do whatever it takes.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm racing him, whether you want me to or not.<eos> - And I can't talk you out of it?<eos> - Not this time.
If dad...<eos> I--<eos> - I will say, if anything, Barry sure has an ample number of fathers to kill.<eos> - If you're gonna kill me, kill me.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You're not racing anybody.<eos> - Come on, Joe.<eos> You know Barry better than that.<eos> You raised him. He'll say yes if he thinks he can save you.<eos> - Not this time.
In battle, choose your weapon wisely.<eos> All right?<eos> Some people choose a gun.<eos> I choose a Phillips-head screwdriver.<eos> - Oh, oh, I'm sorry.<eos> You're so particular.<eos> - Ramon, can you just please-- have you ever worked with a tool before?<eos> - I'm working with one now.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> One, two, and...
Some scary shit, right..?<eos> Scary my ass...<eos> Anyways... That is the rumor.<eos> Rumor?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Hyeon Gi Hyeong.<eos> Oh that guy... I mean really...<eos> I see he's even gabbing to you now...<eos> Maybe it is just gossip but he isn't the only one saying it.<eos> Who else?
Crazy ass...<eos> Hey you should go check out all the clinics around the area.<eos> See if there's any medical records on Park Byeong Wook.<eos> Hey stop throwing rocks!<eos> Hyeongnim, this is so pointless.<eos> This is important you moron.<eos> An infection, it has something to do with festering infections, we can track that down.<eos> Just go already!<eos> Stop throwing those, you can hurt somebody!<eos> Ah goddammit!
You wait here, don't move!<eos> Get back here fast!<eos> I said to get back here fast!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I just got here. I have and eye-witness!<eos> A Witness!<eos> Hurry back here!<eos> Where...<eos> It's like you visit hell every night by yourself.<eos> Not just once or twice either...
Your daughter possessed..?<eos> What could she possibly have done...<eos> Yes...<eos> When you go fishing, do you always know what you're going drag out..?<eos> No.<eos> This is ghost is just fishing, it doesn't know what it'll pull out either.<eos> Threw out the bait and your daughter just happened to notice it.<eos> That's all there is to it!<eos> Park Chon Bae.<eos> This one?

The developments?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You had Julian De Vos' file for a week.<eos> And you said you would get me information on the black site he escaped from.<eos> Getting the file put eyes on me.<eos> I've had to move very carefully.<eos> I'd like a time frame.<eos> What would help is the black-site information.<eos> Julian De Vos will lead me to Thomas Shaw.<eos> Us.
You make sure your hat's screwed on right.<eos> Do not fuck this up.<eos> We're covering all contingencies.<eos> Clare is going to be fine.<eos> Azar Gulek.<eos> My nephew's wife.<eos> From Saray.<eos> Iranian family.<eos> Azar married...<eos> Huseyin.

Check.<eos> To your left.<eos> Who has visual on the package?<eos> One, negative.<eos> Two, negative.<eos> Standby, eight.<eos> Check.<eos> Your hosts are in position.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> My job.
He took the pages.<eos> I can prove it.<eos> Ask him to show you his hands.<eos> He's been hiding them since I got here.<eos> Look, if it would help to clear things up, I'd be happy to.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> I don't need proof to know what's really going on here.<eos> Emma, when are you gonna admit that this isn't really about my brother?<eos> What else would you think it was about?<eos> Us.
The storm is upon us, men!<eos> Raise the main sail!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Look alive for your captain, men!<eos> You're just in time.<eos> We can't take this battering much longer.<eos> What course should I have the men chart?<eos> Continue on our present course.<eos> Dead ahead.<eos> Into the storm?
Okay, yeah, got it. They're big, mean, smart.<eos> Just tell us where they are, we'll go spank their naked butts.<eos> Nope, we got to retrieve that Necronomicon before they get their hands on it.<eos> That's all we have to be concerned about right now.<eos> This is easy!<eos> We'll be back in the Sunshine State before you can say Fort Ticonderoga.<eos> Where'd you put it?<eos> The best hiding place you could think of, was a fucking corpse?<eos> ! Dead flesh masks the scent of The Book from the Spawn.<eos> So in terms of quick thinking, not the worst idea.
What's a Lillian Pendergrass?<eos> That beautiful creature right there.<eos> I'd know that caboose anywhere.<eos> Are you having a stroke?<eos> Hey, you say that now, back in the day, Lillian Pendergrass was a smoking hot former gymnast turned Phys Ed teacher.<eos> You know what I'm talking about?<eos> She wore these tiny, little polyester shorts.<eos> You know during the summer, when you find that perfect peach?<eos> Your next words better be "the end," or I will shoot us both.<eos> - Me first.
Someone's on the fast track to detective.<eos> All right, smart-ass.<eos> You stand there, and crack wise.<eos> We'll just see what the coroner has to say.<eos> But dollars to donuts, Ash Williams will figure in his explanation, somehow.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me.<eos> I said, excuse me.<eos> Oh no, no, no.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Not up the butt!
What the fuck was that?<eos> Ah! Stop it!<eos> What is your genius plan for getting the book back?<eos> Throw one of our epic parties tonight.<eos> And the kids who stole your car will show up.<eos> We might not be able to find the book, but we can go after the ones who are searching for it.<eos> - Mama.<eos> - Then let's go kill your kids.<eos> What the rice and beans is he doing here?<eos> Help!
Sue Bailey, the "Reno Star," everything.<eos> Madam President, who would you say would be your best person to be at that meeting as my number two?<eos> - I could.<eos> - Richard.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Okay, listen, I need to talk to Bob privately, so everybody get out, please.<eos> - Even...<eos> - Yeah-huh.<eos> Bob, I am going crazy here in DC.<eos> I just...
Previously, on "Fear The Walking Dead."<eos> Nick found a log book to that boat.<eos> San Diego's dead.<eos> Military burned it down.<eos> Mayday!

What church y'all go to?<eos> - Our Lady...<eos> - Of the Holy Womb...<eos> - ...of the Holy Womb. - ...<eos> Womb of Jesus.<eos> It's a small congregation, but it's fierce.<eos> It's holy.<eos> Okay, Emily's working on her nails now.<eos> - Good.<eos> Dark?
We would be tracking her vitals...<eos> It's okay, Catherine.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Oh, wow, that is loud, honey.<eos> That's loud.<eos> Oh, "Stephen Hawking" here is indisposed, so I'll just...<eos> - Marjorie, can you help me with this?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> I just want to assure you, Madam President, we would do everything in our power to ensure...<eos> Yeah, just a sec.
- Lift me up.<eos> - Lift her up, Lord.<eos> No, I mean actually lift me up 'cause my heel is stuck in this thing.<eos> Yeah, I got it.<eos> Okay, just so you know, after the ventilator is removed, there might be some coughing.<eos> It's reflexive.<eos> - or suffering in any way. - Okay.<eos> Okay, why don't I give you a moment to say goodbye?<eos> Oh, you mean now?<eos> What...
I can't.<eos> Catherine, play the Tim McGraw thing.<eos> Just not fair.<eos> This is just not fair.<eos> - A very moving eulogy.<eos> - Oh, thank you, Geo<eos> When you feel up to it, you and Catherine and I should sit down and discuss the estate and how you fit into all of it.<eos> How I fit into the estate?<eos> It's not uncommon for an inheritance to skip a generation and your mother decided to leave the bulk of her estate to Catherine.<eos> The bulk?
Yeah, I was seeing this girl back in Pomona.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Maria Santos.<eos> Mm. Long time?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> A few months.<eos> Then my mom moved us back to LA.<eos> New school.<eos> Parochial.
That's what I'm banking on?<eos> Yes.<eos> Other girls left on this planet?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Somewhere out there.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Shit.<eos> We need help!<eos> Should I shoot them?<eos> Help!
Victor is impulsive.<eos> So you've known him a long time?<eos> - Victor?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Years.<eos> Since he met Tom.<eos> - Thomas Abigail?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> My mom works for the Abigails.<eos> For the father, now the son.
She raised Tom and I together.<eos> She's staying at the Baja house now.<eos> Okay, so it is safe there.<eos> I mean, you wouldn't let your mother stay if it weren't.<eos> You don't know my mother, man.<eos> My mother would be safe anywhere, in any world.<eos> Especially this one.<eos> Death is a way to new life.<eos> - Gracias, Celia.<eos> - De nada.
But, I mean, if you had a gun to your head...<eos> Oh, maybe the gun doesn't have any bullets.<eos> Well, thank you so much for coming.<eos> It was my pleasure.<eos> Oh, gentlemen.<eos> Well, that was completely useless.<eos> Ma'am, we need a final decision right now, even if it's the wrong one.<eos> I just need a little bit more time.<eos> If we don't put a plan into action tomorrow morning, then by Monday we will be Greece.<eos> The country, not the musical.
Okay, well, when Connor does recon, that'll be our chance.<eos> It'll be a small window, but it'll be enough.<eos> There's five boats moored by the shoreline.<eos> We take one, we go.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Make the call.<eos> Connor, this is Jack, over.<eos> What do you want with us?<eos> They're putting your girl to work.<eos> - How?
You want him, trade.<eos> One hour.<eos> Your brother for my family.<eos> Okay, I'll play.<eos> One man with Reed.<eos> If he's unharmed, you get yours.<eos> I'll go.<eos> I'll go.<eos> I'll bring him.<eos> One hour.
DAN: Just got an endorsement from the "Courier."<eos> The emails from Tom Petty's lawyers keep on getting angrier and angrier.<eos> How am I not on "The Hill's" 50 Hottest Staffers list this year?<eos> This year?<eos> I am on a career rocket ship to Mars right now, Dan, except I'm gonna leave Matt Damon there because the guy made potatoes in his own shit like a fucking animal.<eos> The whole point of the 50 Hottest is not to be on it.<eos> - You're number 26, Mr. Egan.<eos> - Yeah, five years in a row now.<eos> It's to use it to learn who to fuck.<eos> Who?
Yeah, this is a no haters alley.<eos> Okay, you and Boo-Boo the ball-fondling bear here have exactly two seconds to get the fuck out.<eos> Our work is done here.<eos> Tell Selina hello.<eos> Yeah, great place for an event, Dan.<eos> The teenager selling cocaine in the bathroom thought so, too. - Hey.<eos> - Oh, looking good, 26.<eos> Hi, all.<eos> Ma'am, have you seen Tom?<eos> - Couple times.
What do you mean, they?<eos> There are two of them.<eos> Tell me one of them is Miguel.<eos> Yeah, the one at the wheel is.<eos> The other guy I don't know.<eos> Madison, get everyone down below deck.<eos> You need to hide.<eos> Luis, give me your gun.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> Engine room, now.
- Dalai Lama, I'm so sick of him.<eos> - He's insufferable.<eos> Do we have a press release ready to go, Mike?<eos> All I got to do is press send and we... actually, I do need to spell-check this thing.<eos> Ma'am, Minna Häkkinen is through security and headed this way.<eos> How is it that that Asperger salad inserted herself into this situation?<eos> President Lu trusts her.<eos> Likes what she did with the IMF.<eos> No, I'll tell you what he likes.<eos> Nordic beav.
- It is historically significant and apt.<eos> Gold is a very auspicious color for the Chinese.<eos> - It signifies prosperity and good luck.<eos> - Oh, great.<eos> - You have pleased them.<eos> - Oh, I'm pleased, then.<eos> Great.<eos> And now they are discussing how casually you are dressed.<eos> They say you look like a prisoner or a pirate.<eos> An exercise book.
Let's talk, buddy.<eos> You know, the school really wants us to keep talking to our kids about trolling on the Internet and how serious it is.<eos> I guess the troll from the school message boards is now harassing a famous olympic athlete from Denmark. Have you seen this?<eos> Have you heard about this?<eos> Yeah, well, she kind of called him out and said he could never get her to quit social media, and you know, you might say she's asking for it.<eos> But, uh, now this troll is being copied by other trolls who are all dog-piling to see if they can get her to quit, and, well, god only knows what they're gonna do tonight.<eos> Well, see ya, pal.<eos> You be sure to let your mom know we talked more about the horrific consequences of trolling.<eos> I want to tell you that I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
Sexy.<eos> Uh, would you care for another coconut water?<eos> They are the most expensive unpasteurized variety, if that's any concern.<eos> Actually, my concern is the room.<eos> It's kind of a dump.<eos> Oh, sure, now.<eos> But with a new coat of paint, you'll hardly recognize the place when you move in next month.<eos> Actually... shit's pivoted.<eos> I need a place next week.<eos> Next week?
I was there.<eos> Don, again.<eos> Well, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, because the plan has always been... entirely based on the freemium model, like Dropbox?<eos> You know, you give the platform away free to consumers, and then once you have a big enough user base, then you sell premium services to businesses.<eos> If we're giving it away now and waiting until later to sell it, what are we doing here now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> We could maybe ask Jack... when he gets back from wherever...<eos> Sorry, one second.<eos> Just... just one moment.
I know everybody's name.<eos> Look... we can't cut everything about this platform that makes it revolutionary just because that's a little harder for you guys to sell, all right?<eos> If we want to sell out, let's just sell all the way out.<eos> Let's just take the algorithm, jam it into a metal fucking box, stick it in the back of a data center somewhere, so it can't connect to anything, and it just sits there and no one even knows it's there.<eos> Doug, still shadowing Keith.<eos> When you say "metal box," you're talking about a rack-mounted server-type appliance?<eos> I am using it as a rhetorical example of a bad idea.<eos> That's fucking stupid.<eos> Oh my God. I just need to find Jack.<eos> One second.
And whatever makes the value of that stock go up, that is what we are going to make.<eos> And maybe sometime in the future, we could change the world and perform miracles, and all of that stuff, and I hope we do.<eos> But, like I told you before, I'm not going to mortgage the present for that.<eos> I need to move the needle today.<eos> And now, if you will excuse me. I paid $150,000 for the semen that's about to come out of that stallion, and I would very much like to be there to see that it happens.<eos> Hey, Richard!<eos> Yes?<eos> I just got a text from Keith, Northeast Regional.<eos> He says the guys love your idea.<eos> What idea?
You know... at this point, if it'll make you feel better, sure, you can go talk to Barker.<eos> See? Was that so hard?<eos> Actually, yes, that was painfully difficult.<eos> Yeah, she's definitely dead.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> Gloria!<eos> Gloria!<eos> Gl...<eos> Would you... take this daughter of Neptune back from whence she came?<eos> The toilet, dear.
Now you're growing old.<eos> Like these maggots.<eos> And you're going to die, slowly.<eos> Like these maggots.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But first, I'm going to send you back to hell where you belong.<eos> And how exactly?<eos> The Necronomicon was gone, and I'm up here.<eos> I'm here to stay, Ruby, and you get to watch me burn your world to the ground.<eos> Never.
- I'm not the boy's daddy.<eos> I just thought that-<eos> - I don't know what's happening to him.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> You take a vulnerable kid, an addict, drop him in a mess of death and doubt, it won't be long before he starts looking for something to cling to.<eos> In comes Mama Celia with her authentic Mexican cuisine, side of quasi-religious voodoo bullshit and voila.<eos> You bet your ass she's got her hooks in him.<eos> This isn't how I imagined us parting.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Back to the boat. Ha.
Your son?<eos> Is that your son?<eos> Ramon.<eos> I'm looking for my son.<eos> He's about this tall.<eos> Thin.<eos> He's got black hair.<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> Este?<eos> East?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> We're just going to let them throw him out?<eos> Alone?
Have you ever lost a grandparent?<eos> All my grandparents are dead.<eos> Wait.<eos> Um, no.<eos> One or two might still be alive.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Good to be back in good old DC, away from the greed, the money, and the hookers.<eos> Listen, um so, if you're not doing anything later...<eos> Jesus fucking Christ.
There's still hope.<eos> Everyone!<eos> Can I have your attention please? !<eos> I know the past few weeks have been very difficult... for all of us.<eos> I know, now more than ever, that something has to change.<eos> I thought a lot about this the past few days. I've seen a lot of things I never thought I would ever see.<eos> These are all complex issues we're having to face. And now I know that after you break it down, there's really only one answer.<eos> Good for you, Uncle Kyle!<eos> Fellow trolls, let me introduce you to...<eos> Skankhunt42.
- Yeah.<eos> He's Airbnbing my Airbnb. So, if it's okay with you,<eos> I might need to stay a little bit longer, um...<eos> I can go around the back to get to the bathroom once Fred's here.<eos> - When's he moving in?<eos> - Wouldn't we all like to know.<eos> Fred, Erlich Bachman.<eos> You said you'd get back to me about the room.<eos> I don't mean to pressure you, but I need you to decide now.<eos> In this moment, on this phone call.
Well, Gavin has just done that.<eos> He's validated the market so there's... there's no reason to revote. We win.<eos> I can't wait to see the look on that AAR prick's face when we come in there and gut him like a--<eos> - He's going to be fine.<eos> Welcome, men and ladies of Endframe.<eos> Rather than incestuously promoting the same faces from within, you represent fresh blood, new ideas. Everything Nucleus was not.<eos> It is my honor to personally welcome you all to Hooli.<eos> Does he really not remember us?<eos> How long did you work at Hooli?<eos> The last time?
We got to brush those teeth!<eos> - Oh! Chet, you idiot.<eos> I told you to wait upstairs.<eos> Chill, I'm just looking for a beer.<eos> Oh, relax!<eos> Just want one.<eos> You can pound the other five.<eos> Oh!<eos> You're going to have to go through him, to get to me.<eos> No way.

- What are you waiting for, shoot him!<eos> Let's get one thing straight, yo-yos.<eos> I kill demons, not people.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> Unless those people are demons, who look like people.<eos> And then I kill people, but they're not really people, they're demons. You understand?<eos> In a minute, I'll prove it.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - He's full of it!<eos> Yep, any minute now.
They were close friends.<eos> I saw them a few days ago.<eos> They had food, water.<eos> They were okay.<eos> Things change so quickly now.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> South.
Come on, at least try.<eos> I am, asshole.<eos> Your thumbs are freakishly long.<eos> Dexterous thumbs.<eos> Dexterous thumbs.<eos> Look, you're pathetic.<eos> You know that?<eos> Oh, type A girl doesn't like losing.<eos> Type A girl doesn't lose.<eos> One more.
Yeah, try to keep up, Dinesh.<eos> We get our money in stages.<eos> Right? We get $2 million upfront to get us going, to design and build the product, but we don't get the next three million until we take a product to market.<eos> And Jack was okay with hemorrhaging money, because he thought we were launching the box and then getting the next three million in the next few weeks.<eos> But the platform will take way longer to launch than that.<eos> So we are effectively a $250 million company who just took $5 million in funding and now we're dead-ass broke.<eos> Our burn rate is astronomical, and every day we sit in limbo like this...<eos> What if we don't?<eos> What if we don't sit in limbo?<eos> Like fuck limbo, right?
Baltimore.<eos> HL Mencken hails from Baltimore.<eos> Who?<eos> Widely perceived as a racist, but... his work on the English language is comprehensive, and his perspicuous skewering of evangelicals is laudable.<eos> Monica, my mission here is not merely to have fun.<eos> That's... that's okay.<eos> When I voted against you, at the board meeting, I just want...<eos> Monica, this is not about you, for once.<eos> I brought you here to say... I am sorry.<eos> For...?
Stop doing that.<eos> - You're going to run out of fingers.<eos> Somebody get me out of here!<eos> Pablo!<eos> Oh, thank God you're here!<eos> You got to get me out of here.<eos> Baal put the whammy on Kelly.<eos> Now she's crazy as a mad cow.<eos> Shut your trap, Slashy!<eos> On the ground, hands behind your back, now!
I chose despite the past and I chose wrong.<eos> Hey, that's the drink talking.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm good. Whoo!<eos> I'm good, I have a hollow leg.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Come on. - Cheers.<eos> To motherhood. - Okay, to motherhood.

The dead are walking toward their final resting place.<eos> And when they leave, when the world is washed clean of death, we the faithful will remain.<eos> We have been chosen.<eos> We will outlast death.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Why are you so sure?<eos> Drink.<eos> You're welcome to stay with us.<eos> But if you ever put my people in danger again, I will feed you to the wall.<eos> To family.

You sound like my mother.<eos> I'm trying to be anything but.<eos> I'm not asking you not to go.<eos> I need you to go.<eos> Everyone here needs you to go.<eos> I'm asking you to be careful.<eos> Brave but careful.<eos> 'Cause I want you to come back.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> - For what?
You need an adult?<eos> You need an adult?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Can I play?<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> Let's do this. Let's do this.<eos> I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.<eos> - You're in?<eos> - Let's do this.<eos> Right down the line.
Yeah.<eos> I got to learn to talk to someone that isn't you or Alejandro.<eos> How is that going?<eos> You're wearing clean socks?<eos> Yeah, did I get that right?<eos> Close.<eos> Very good.<eos> If I had known this was gonna happen, I'd have take Spanish in high school.<eos> What did you take?<eos> Uh, just myself very seriously.
You're lucky.<eos> Doesn't seem like any of your organs were punctured.<eos> Yeah? Still hurts like a son of a bitch.<eos> I can give you some ibuprofen for the pain.<eos> - With a scotch chaser.<eos> - We'll see what we can find.<eos> - You'll find scotch.<eos> - Yeah, we'll make it happen, Victor.<eos> - I need to stitch you up as soon as possible.<eos> Pressure on the wound, please.
Two hours.<eos> What was that about?<eos> What was what about?<eos> Hector.<eos> You were fighting.<eos> I ask him to come, he say no.<eos> I was hoping he could convince his brother to come home.<eos> We need to get Victor's meds.<eos> We don't have time for anything else.<eos> - Warehouse and back.
Do exactly what you said.<eos> Go back in time, and undo all this.<eos> Of course!<eos> I've done it before.<eos> I went to the Middle Ages.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I can go back in time, change history, fix all this, and you'll be alive again, Pablo.<eos> Get in the car!<eos> Okay, I need you to read this, right now.<eos> Absolutely not.
More time to focus on your work.<eos> It's just the wind.<eos> Now, before we start these translations, there's... just something I need you to help me with.<eos> Please, there's no time.<eos> The key!<eos> No.<eos> Not until I know where that book is.<eos> Now spill.<eos> Unlock me first.<eos> Not a chance.
Unlock me first.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> He always keeps it with him, so the book is here now.<eos> Just let me go, and I'll show you!<eos> Please!<eos> I'm not whatever you think I am!<eos> Please... don't let him hurt me again.<eos> - Down.<eos> You'll forgive the darkness. And the dirt.<eos> And the cobwebs.
- We don't have to dig out the slug.<eos> So you take both hands. Top and bottom, squeeze together nice and tight.<eos> We have to stop that bleeding.<eos> - I'm gonna try to stitch it up.<eos> - With what?<eos> With whatever I can find in his house.<eos> It's gonna be okay. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> You okay, bro?<eos> My man can take the pain.<eos> - What pain?
Yo, James.<eos> What you in the mood for, man?<eos> Breast, wing?<eos> Anything but a thigh, man.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Pretty good.<eos> Better.<eos> What's your pain level?<eos> Scale of one to 10?<eos> Like, a three.

I forgot to tell him I loved him.<eos> The second he was too far away, I realized the last thing I said to him was,<eos> "God damn you."<eos> That's the last thing his father said to him.<eos> That's the last thing he'll remember.<eos> You didn't know him when he was little, but he had this huge heart.<eos> He was such a good boy.<eos> I know.<eos> When you met him he was already so angry.<eos> At me, Liza.
It came up.<eos> But I mean, honestly, how else was I going to explain that me and my friends were at a bar?<eos> That is a good point.<eos> Anytime you're near a woman, it is important to explain why.<eos> Otherwise, they get nervous.<eos> Gentlemen. To Pied Piper's past, and now present CEO.<eos> - Oh, what about future?<eos> - Jared, we'll worry about that later.<eos> Tonight it's about Richard.<eos> To Richard.
Use a notepad. Code on your phone.<eos> We have a deadline here.<eos> No, Gavin, you have a deadline.<eos> We quit, like we should have done the first time.<eos> What first time?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We both worked at Nucleus right here in this room.<eos> Yeah, before you fired us and rehired us to do the exact same thing without ever noticing.<eos> I invited you to my wedding, Gavin.<eos> Why?
Imagine what effect we can have on the rest of the world.<eos> We're like super trolls who can change anything.<eos> Can I talk to you for second?<eos> Why did you bring them here?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> We're all on a team now, Skankhunt.<eos> That was one-time deal so nobody would find out who we are.<eos> But you saw what we did when we worked together.<eos> Just think about what we could do to, like, the presidential election.<eos> The election?
Ike!<eos> Ike, buddy, can you hear me?<eos> I need you to do something, okay?<eos> Daddy needs your help.<eos> I need you to go to your browser and sign on to the school message board, okay?<eos> Can you do that for me?<eos> The school message board and then log in. Lower-case "s," "skankhunt42."<eos> You got it?<eos> Wow.<eos> Wow, what?
I'm sorry.<eos> All you guys, I'm sorry.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> Okay, Skank. All right.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hello?<eos> Could I please speak to the person in charge?<eos> I have something to say.<eos> Please, just for a moment?
After all they've been through, risking their lives.<eos> Believe me, I get it.<eos> After 20 years, you'd think I could say I was used to it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, something unrelated I wanted to mention.<eos> ICE started tracking the American militia movement.<eos> They've been involved in some hate crimes against immigrants.<eos> Your name popped up.<eos> I hear they put a...<eos> Bounty on my head?
They're behind the coyote ring.<eos> They might have some info.<eos> Maybe I can help you with this.<eos> I found a second file in Mateo's trash.<eos> It's the Coast Guard routes for the same area, but this one is dated January 19-- that's today.<eos> Another shipment of immigrants.<eos> And a good place to find an 1821.<eos> Apurante. U.S. Coast Guard!<eos> Get down on the ground!<eos> NCIS!
When you were being held at gunpoint.<eos> But you have to go back?<eos> No one but you can do this job?<eos> I came here because I'm fine.<eos> I came here because I'm ready.<eos> Now I just need you to sign off on that.<eos> 'Sup, brother?<eos> Abby.<eos> Chris Roberts is, like, staring at you.<eos> Really, me?
15.<eos> What's he been accused of? No, her name's Abby Stewart.<eos> She's the victim.<eos> Working as an advocate?<eos> What is this, penance for representing a serial killer?<eos> You're still holding that against me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, her mother and I went to Dowland together.<eos> Abby was raped at a school dance last Friday.<eos> Okay, so almost a week ago.
We went straight to the police that night.<eos> Did your daughter tell anybody else what had happened?<eos> Any friends? Not that I know of, but something did happen.<eos> We were making out.<eos> He asked if I wanted to go somewhere private.<eos> I liked him. I wanted him to like me.<eos> You liked him, you kissed him.<eos> That doesn't mean you wanted anything more.<eos> Okay, Abby, so where did he take you?<eos> The school darkroom.
Maybe, but there's no way Abby did.<eos> She's obsessed with Chris.<eos> So you think she's just making this up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She could just be mad that Chris didn't ask her out again.<eos> [laughs] Will Moore?<eos> Jack Peters?<eos> Yeah.<eos> NYPD. We got a couple questions.<eos> About Chris?
It sounds to me like you're blaming the victim.<eos> No, I am not.<eos> It's always the rapist's fault.<eos> Again, twisting what I'm saying.<eos> So there is nothing that the accuser can do that would contribute to this situation?<eos> If she's sexy?<eos> Willingly going to private areas?<eos> Enthusiastically engaging in foreplay?<eos> None of this could possibly lead on a young, inexperienced teenaged boy?<eos> Objection.
Have you ever heard of teenaged boys bragging about their sexual conquests even when no such exploits took place?<eos> Are you asking me if your client's a liar?<eos> I'm asking you if he's a teenager who, as you said, was being pressured to claim he'd scored?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Redirect.<eos> Detective Carisi, let me ask you again.<eos> During your initial interview with the accused, did he lie to you?<eos> Yeah, he flat-out denied having any sexual contact with Abby.<eos> It was only when we confronted him with the DNA evidence of his semen on Abby's dress that he admitted the truth.<eos> Objection.
Is it fair to say that you had a crush on Chris Roberts?<eos> I guess.<eos> Were you flattered when he texted you?<eos> Kind of, but...<eos> I'm not saying it was love and marriage.<eos> Must be a nice guy.<eos> Why else would you go to the darkroom with him?<eos> I thought he was nice.<eos> Were you aware of the darkroom's reputation?<eos> Objection.
- It's the name of the club.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Doesn't matter what I'd call it.<eos> I didn't do anything Abby didn't want.<eos> So she went to the police, testified on the stand, was publicly humiliated and ostracized by her friends for something that she made up?<eos> No, she probably thinks she was raped.<eos> Well, what does that tell you?<eos> That she thinks that now, but she did want it at the time.<eos> How can you be sure of what she was thinking or what she wanted?<eos> Objection.
Look at that pussy.<eos> Come here!<eos> All right.<eos> Look at that.<eos> This is... big of me.<eos> I hope that you can appreciate that.<eos> We were friends.<eos> I mean, inasmuch as I like to collect strays.<eos> But then you're scheming to be part of the family, marrying my sister, whom incidentally, you seem to have completely fucking forgotten about.<eos> Her?
I hadn't decided what to call you.<eos> It wouldn't be right to use his name.<eos> What about Bernard?<eos> Bernard, yes.<eos> But who am I?<eos> That is a very complex question, for which I can only offer a simple answer.<eos> You are the perfect instrument, the ideal partner, the way any tool partners with the hand that wields it.<eos> Together, we're going to do great things.<eos> After such a long absence, it's good to have you back.<eos> Finally.
Because you're dead.<eos> Because you're just a memory.<eos> Because I killed you.<eos> William?<eos> Hello, Dolores.<eos> I'm gonna finish the work Arnold began.<eos> Find all the sentient hosts, set them free.<eos> What makes you think they'd trust you?<eos> If they remember, they will know what you've done to them.<eos> Me?
Now, this is the surgical informed consent form.<eos> This is the anesthesia consent form.<eos> - Shahir. - Hmm?<eos> I know all this.<eos> I'm just being thorough.<eos> This is a very important day for me.<eos> For you?<eos> And for Charlie, of course.<eos> And this is the consent for retention of pathology specimens.<eos> Pen?
That's what this is.<eos> We're gonna have a baby.<eos> This complicates things.<eos> Let's give them a moment before we tell them the bad news.<eos> Male announcer: Dr. Carter, to obstetrics, please.<eos> Dr. Carter, please report to obstetrics.<eos> Hey. I tried to call you.<eos> Why did you bump your surgery?<eos> Asha's been on for 24 hours.<eos> The truth.
How long would it take to have a consent and capacity hearing to review Kristine Field's case?<eos> She died.<eos> I hadn't heard.<eos> Yes, uh, had a stroke this morning.<eos> Shahir pronounced brain death, but there are no next of kin, so I need the board to rule to withdraw life support.<eos> Is that what she wanted?<eos> Yes.<eos> She told Charlie.<eos> Uh, well, Charlie, as her friend, can apply to be a public guardian, but that could take a week or so to file that paperwork.<eos> A week?
There must be a way.<eos> I-I've done the research.<eos> It's a 50-50 chance that you wouldn't survive the anesthetic, and even if you did, there could be birth defects.<eos> But she's next on the list.<eos> Which is why we need to have a conversation about the realities of your condition.<eos> What realities?<eos> If the procedure causes you to go into labor, I need you guys to really think about whether you could care for a baby that premature.<eos> Especially considering all the care River needs, and will need, even after your transplant.<eos> We want you to do whatever you have to do to save him...<eos> Or her.
You've got it, Shahir.<eos> I need to focus.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Ah, the transverse sinus.<eos> - Did you nick it?<eos> - I don't know yet.<eos> Hemostatic mesh, foam, patties!<eos> All of it.<eos> Alex, you can't operate on him!<eos> Foam, now!
It all leads to you.<eos> Nothing.<eos> He's still in V-fib.<eos> Go again!<eos> And we will become ourselves.<eos> Charlie...<eos> Okay. All clear.<eos> Charlie, come back to me.<eos> Charlie...<eos> One more time.
What?<eos> Yeah, he drinks appletinis.<eos> What?<eos> They're good.<eos> I'm gonna sit this one out, guys.<eos> I don't want to slur my acceptance speech.<eos> Come on, Maggs.<eos> We'll be like Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.<eos> Twist my arm.<eos> Mmm. To the dynamic duo.
- You did.<eos> You also told me you were getting divorced.<eos> I didn't realize how much I still loved her.<eos> Till she showed up.<eos> What do you want from me, Jeremy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess before I go I just want to make sure you're okay.<eos> No, you just don't want me to be mad at you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
Do you know the meaning of "off the record"?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Which is why I'm only joking.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's your court, your advantage.<eos> You set the rules, I follow them.<eos> But, frankly, I'm not interested in a heavily regulated, closely guarded interview with the leader of the free world.<eos> Nor is that what we want to give you.<eos> I want a conversation with the man.<eos> A meaningful one.
- Jake is an adult, Dad.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've overstepped... again.<eos> I just want what's best for both my kids.<eos> Mellie Grant.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> You're drinking from the chalice now.<eos> We have to keep fighting for a better America...<eos> A stronger America.
- Yes?<eos> Since you weren't there, I wanted to see if maybe you wanted to come over for dinner tomorrow.<eos> Casey's at her grandma's for a few days, so I have the house to myself.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe it's not a great idea, huh?<eos> No, no, it is.<eos> I'd love to.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yes, absolutely.
Real power.<eos> Do you really not know what you are?<eos> 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue power.<eos> You don't have a father.<eos> You were raised by Command.<eos> If I were you, I would pick up whatever chips you have left and run.<eos> Run, Olivia.<eos> Run.<eos> I found myself in my office, sitting in my favorite club chair, relishing on all that was finally, deservedly... still.<eos> To a happy retirement.
Don't give me a sermon like you don't know.<eos> Your guy.<eos> He's coming out.<eos> What?<eos> My...<eos> My guy?<eos> I don't...<eos> I never considered it before.<eos> But, yeah, you were made.<eos> Just like us.
Cut to footage, cut to footage, cut to the damn footage.<eos> We apparently have footage of Governor Vargas's heroic act.<eos> We're gonna cut to that right now.<eos> Take a look.<eos> Unbelievable images this evening.<eos> The heroic and selfless stand made by Governor Francisco Vargas.<eos> If you hadn't heard of Francisco Vargas before tonight, then you will certainly know him by tomorrow morning.<eos> We will return to this story after a quick break.<eos> Back it up, everyone.<eos> This side of the tape.
The governor was incredible.<eos> "He said," Let the others go.<eos> Take me.<eos> I'm the one you want."<eos> - It never gets old.<eos> - He was just so calm.<eos> And then like a minute later... - What?<eos> - The guy let everybody else go except for Governor Vargas.<eos> It's the private entrance to the residence.<eos> Your residence.
Milhouse, you were incredible.<eos> Maybe that's because... I'm not Milhouse.<eos> Oh, but, is Milhouse okay?<eos> Is Milhouse ever okay? Good point.<eos> Now let's go to the soda fountain and ask the jerk for a float with two straws.<eos> What year are you from?<eos> Oh, who cares?<eos> Mr. Burns, Mr. Smithers,<eos> I make-a something very special for your reunion.<eos> One cheese pizza.
Which is too bad, because I desperately need that dollar.<eos> I could also use the fishing line to get some dinner.<eos> Bart, if Milhouse is hiding with you, tell him he has to shop for school clothes.<eos> Yay!<eos> School clothes.<eos> This isn't right, no one's falling for my pranks.<eos> Huh! At least it wasn't a total waste.<eos> I found a quarter.<eos> Well, we sure got him good.<eos> Duh, what a moron, duh.

Because, as I understand it, you were, uh,<eos> involved with her.<eos> How deeply?<eos> A merciful God spared me the details.<eos> Damn, mate.<eos> As wickets go, this one is hella sticky.<eos> What to do?<eos> Uh, poor Rob Thomas.<eos> This is how a skull breaks.<eos> Hey.
Thanks.<eos> Hey, chin up.<eos> Turns out they aren't letting your town burn to the ground after all.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> My friend Doug got a call from the Mystic Falls city planning office this morning.<eos> They said he should come reclaim his house today.<eos> Something about the fire-risk zone being reevaluated?<eos> Do you know what street Doug lives on?<eos> Just to make things interesting.<eos> Bull's-eye!
It's a talisman spelled with magic.<eos> I'm hoping the babies will pull from it instead of you.<eos> And if they don't?<eos> They still have to bake in there a little bit longer.<eos> And I haven't even done the thank you notes from the baby shower yet.<eos> If it doesn't work,<eos> I'll find something stronger.<eos> I won't let anything bad happen, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - My pleasure.
Besides, once you know the supernatural is real, there's really nowhere to hide.<eos> Might as well just take a stand, right?<eos> You are 100% not who I thought you were.<eos> I mean,<eos> I thought you were cute, maybe a little damaged, in a sweet way.<eos> But I didn't know that you were insanely brave.<eos> Emphasis on the "insane."<eos> I thought you'd be back in Mystic Falls by now.<eos> I just, uh... wanted to say thank you.<eos> For today.
You'll surely sleep easy tonight.<eos> Do you like her?<eos> Bonnie?<eos> And what if I did?<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Smart and loyal.<eos> And you appear to be only two of those things.<eos> I'm sorry I chose Julian.<eos> If I could take it back, I would choose you.<eos> Every time.
We'renotdoingany goodhere . Let's go see Barney ogden.<eos> Man: Ma'am.<eos> So, you live close by?<eos> A few towns over.<eos> Kimiko: Your house is so neat.<eos> Francisca: Thank you.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Have you lived here a long time?<eos> My whole life.
It's true, though.<eos> You know, what, thank you, man. Dude, I had twins last week.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Oh, snap. They were born, like, a second apart.<eos> Their mom was fertile as shit.<eos> Ah, that's... You're the king.<eos> I kid you not, last weekend, made babies with the chick from the six train.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah. - Northbound or southbound?<eos> - Southbound.
- How did you...<eos> - Yeah, no, it's fine. Did you get on a Metro North train?<eos> It doesn't matter how I got there, but I got there and I met a chick, and then I made like... th... f... six.<eos> I had six babies at once.<eos> Me and her.<eos> And we...<eos> They just came out.<eos> It was like, you thought they were done, but it was just... more and more, like...<eos> Okay, so real quick, so you got on a train, and you went upstate, the train thing again.<eos> Oh my God,
- No, they will never...<eos> - They're terrible this year.<eos> No, no, no, my, uh, my father's father was in the '86 Mets parade.<eos> - Was he?<eos> - They tried to get him to do blow.<eos> - Who, Gooden?<eos> - Gooden.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, he tried to give my father's friend blow.<eos> - Not even horse tranquilizer.
- You nervous?<eos> - No, I'm not nervous.<eos> I'm totally cool about it.<eos> Don't be nervous.<eos> Bro, look at me.<eos> Look at me, br...<eos> - Look at me, bro.<eos> - Yeah. This is how awesome you could look<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - in like, an hour.
It's slow, but it's good!<eos> There she is.<eos> The big, green lady with the ice cream thing.<eos> That is quite a ways away.<eos> Champ is here!<eos> Team Jerry in the house, motherfucker! - Phil?<eos> - Oh, you guys know each other?<eos> Oh, he's just a fucking weirdo.<eos> Okay, so the mission failed, is that what happened?<eos> - What mission?
- This is my favorite part.<eos> What the fuck was in that?<eos> - Oh, right?<eos> I'm a kitten again.<eos> And there's all my brothers and sisters.<eos> But not me.<eos> He's coming for me now. What?<eos> Get off me!<eos> He tossed me into an alley.<eos> Alone.
Just as good.<eos> You're so easy to talk to.<eos> You, too!<eos> I was just gonna say, you are so easy to talk to.<eos> - That's so funny that you were...<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I'd like to make a toast.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Um, I'm really happy that I met you, and you seem really nice.<eos> To Shane and Olivia!
Gary, he could never stay in the V.<eos> As hard as he tried.<eos> Then that big bird came, - that big Boeing. - Right.<eos> Lo and behold...<eos> Gary gets sucked right into that engine, And poof! Just a cloud of feathers.<eos> Gary is gone!<eos> Shane's back!<eos> - Oh, Shane!<eos> - What's up, guys?<eos> Exactly, yeah!
Gary is gone!<eos> Shane's back!<eos> - Oh, Shane!<eos> - What's up, guys?<eos> Exactly, yeah!<eos> No, I mean, I saw bits and pieces of Gary flying all over the place. It's like, "There's some Gary.<eos> - There's some Gary. - Uh-huh.<eos> "Hey, my best friend, Gary!"<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, guys, not funny anymore.
- Oh, Shane!<eos> - What's up, guys?<eos> Exactly, yeah!<eos> No, I mean, I saw bits and pieces of Gary flying all over the place. It's like, "There's some Gary.<eos> - There's some Gary. - Uh-huh.<eos> "Hey, my best friend, Gary!"<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, guys, not funny anymore.<eos> You can let me out now.<eos> Guys!
I-i do.<eos> But I...<eos> I don't remember Rachel or...<eos> Or her friend.<eos> It... it's a Skybox.<eos> You know, random people come and go all night.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry if I scared you.<eos> Um, this is my cell just...<eos> Just in case.
- Look, you're just about to tell me how we find this kid, right?<eos> Carnage.<eos> Just like on the girl's shirt.<eos> How's that help find the kid?<eos> Somebody's here.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - What are you doing here so early?<eos> It's easier to catch up on stuff.<eos> Plus, I like to listen to my music kind of loud.<eos> Music?
She gave you a chance you didn't deserve, and you took advantage of her.<eos> Enjoy the next five years scumbag...<eos> Where's Neil?<eos> He finally closed the deal.<eos> I'll give you one guess.<eos> Good night.<eos> Now who's not answering their phone?<eos> I heard you had a conversation with Greg.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
- Really?<eos> - Go back and play some "Madden."<eos> - "Madden"?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh. I would love to.<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> - See what you can do.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Just like old times, huh?
Or from what my mom told me.<eos> - But anything you can remember...<eos> - ­<eos> No matter how small the detail...<eos> Well, it could help.<eos> Are you trying to use the fact that I like you to try and get me to trust you?<eos> A little bit, yes.<eos> We need to find your mother, Luisa.<eos> Is there anything you can remember?<eos> Anything at all?
This is crazy.<eos> I know.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Just a little dizzy.<eos> When was the last time you ate?<eos> Yeah, see, if you have to think about it, it's been too long.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - For my last meal? - No.<eos> For dinner.
Oh.<eos> No.<eos> Come here.<eos> I feel like I'm waking up from a bad dream.<eos> And speaking of dreams...<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Thanks for the tree top...<eos> Why did you send a friend request to my girlfriend?<eos> Your girlfriend?
Oh, God.<eos> Is this now?<eos> Or is this one of my memories?<eos> It's the sweet hereafter, Bernard.<eos> Why do I still remember everything?<eos> - I ought to have been wiped.<eos> - Brutal, isn't it?<eos> Here you are, finally awake, and your only wish is to go back to sleep.<eos> It's not the first time I've awoken.<eos> All the more pity for you.

The network's quiet. And the board's out on their way to the gala.<eos> Bypass the system and start checking raw feeds.<eos> Floor by floor.<eos> I got you.<eos> You came back.<eos> Someone once told me that... there's a path for everyone.<eos> And my path leads me back to you.<eos> If only I had run away with you when you first asked me to.<eos> And where would we run to?<eos> The other world out there?
What the hell?<eos> The system's not responding.<eos> I don't know what's happening.<eos> They must've found the bodies.<eos> - QA will be looking for us.<eos> Aneventhasoccurred.<eos> - Response team has been dispatched.<eos> Remain calm and wait for help.<eos> Delos personnel!<eos> On the ground!

I got her. Male, early 20s.<eos> Fell off a plane at touchdown.<eos> Go to Trauma 1.<eos> Left chest is crushed.<eos> Unable to intubate.<eos> Pale and unresponsive.<eos> Get intubation drugs.<eos> 20 of etomidate and 100 of succs.<eos> Get a labs and a base deficit and trigger the MTP and start transfusing as soon as the blood shows up.<eos> On my count. - Both:
Her name is Maria Gonzalez.<eos> Miguel is her brother.<eos> He was the one that was brought in with her.<eos> All right.<eos> Maria... your brother was very seriously injured.<eos> Alive?<eos> Yes.<eos> He is.<eos> Pero está en terapia intensiva.<eos> Va a necesitar soporte vida.
We're legally bound to treat her.<eos> Which we have done.<eos> She is still in critical condition.<eos> We contract with a private ambulance service.<eos> They provide medical personnel for the patient.<eos> That's how you justify it, then?<eos> Look, I wish I could wave a magic wand and fix it, but I can't.<eos> Maria came her for refuge.<eos> Her brother risked everything so that he could help her, and he sacrificed his life.<eos> For what?
You shouldn't have.<eos> Hurt her deeply.<eos> You know, I never told her about the night that Mom died, what really happened.<eos> Your mother was disturbed.<eos> She had a mental illness.<eos> You and I both know that that's not the reason she killed herself.<eos> Let me get this for you.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> I am really glad that I'm back.<eos> All: To Owen!
Off his liver from the stab wound... He's dumping blood.<eos> - Get him on the table.<eos> - Three, two, one, lift.<eos> Vitals?<eos> 95 over 50, tachy at 140.
Is he still bleeding?<eos> Liver's packed.<eos> How many units is that?<eos> Four blood, four plasma.<eos> Send six more to angio, we're coming soon.<eos> If there's any left. What?<eos> He's type AB.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> I don't blame you for kicking yourself right now.<eos> For what?
Now where's the bullet?<eos> - X-ray clear!<eos> - His thigh?<eos> Knee.<eos> Got him while he was running, leg flexed all the way up.<eos> No pulse.<eos> Bullet could've lodged in the popliteal artery.<eos> Let's get him to CT for an angiogram... go!<eos> Hey, they gonna catch this guy?<eos> The buyer?
The results also show that... she never had cancer.<eos> Just a very weird case, you know?<eos> Turns out Jessica Pope did try and commit suicide.<eos> But that's not what's killing her.<eos> It's an overdose of chemo for a cancer she does not have.<eos> She was misdiagnosed?<eos> And over-treated.<eos> Someone needs to have their license taken away.<eos> Yeah.<eos> At the very least.
How is he? He's stable.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Dr. Rhodes to the ED, stat.<eos> What do we got?<eos> 25-year-old witnessed seizure in the street.<eos> She was clipped by a swerving car.<eos> GCS 3, intubated in the field, 102 over 60, tachy at 110.<eos> Prep the table, let's get him on the monitor.<eos> H and H also.<eos> All right, on my count.
That explains why she seized in the street.<eos> That's not the troubling part.<eos> Yeah, she was loaded up on chemo.<eos> But this woman... never had cancer.<eos> Two patients in one day overdose on chemo... and neither had cancer.<eos> Which, I must admit, does seem suspicious.<eos> Well, it could be a new oncologist in town making incorrect diagnoses.<eos> Or even just mixing up a few charts.<eos> Yeah, but even then, why the overdoses?<eos> And on the same day?
Go home.<eos> You've stirred up enough shit.<eos> I love you, Leo.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> So you're going to leave again?<eos> Shit, what's the matter with him?<eos> Mommy, the baby's crying.<eos> He'll be fine, let him be.<eos> So you'd let us cry, too?<eos> Not all the time.

Sure I'm the father.<eos> C'mon, I wasn't gonna shout it from the rooftops.<eos> And you know it's coming, but it's still a surprise.<eos> And then it takes a while to sink in.<eos> It hits you like a ton of bricks.<eos> I know... we said...<eos> I said lots of things, but I changed my mind...<eos> OK. If you insist, I'll send it.<eos> I'm not at my computer, but soon as I get back.<eos> In an hour, hour and a half...
It wasn't the niggers who fucked him... it was the Arabs.<eos> Big bastards, with fat cocks.<eos> It was nice of him to come back for you.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Did you see his hard-on this morning?<eos> He's dying to stick it in me.<eos> You all think I wanna get fucked because I can't get hard anymore.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> I don't spread 'em like the Queen.<eos> - Not at all.
It's ironic.<eos> You came here to empower some girls, but, instead you empowered this goofball.<eos> See you later, Becks.<eos> Bye.<eos> What the hell?<eos> You're a grown-ass woman.<eos> He should have been kissing you on your mouth.<eos> Yeah, she's still thirsty, Josh.<eos> Uh-uh, I'm not thirsty anymore, Tanya.<eos> Right now, in this moment...
Let's get him to the shock room.<eos> Call respiratory and blood bank.<eos> Get me two of 0 neg and two plasma.<eos> Right away.<eos> We'll take good care of him.<eos> Hey, you hang tough.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Get him unbuckled.<eos> Ready?<eos> On my count.
Chief!<eos> Come on, squad, let's get that door open now.<eos> Jimmy, Otis, get that aerial in place.<eos> Let's go.<eos> May be electrical.<eos> Severed wires.<eos> The whole house was ripped apart.<eos> Let's just hope that the gas lines haven't been cut.<eos> Hey, guys, give us a hand with this.<eos> On my count, ready?
- Hey, go home.<eos> - All right.<eos> Kiss your wife and kids.<eos> Yeah, that's a great idea.<eos> Hey, uh, what did you come in here for?<eos> Exactly what I got.<eos> Good night, brother.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Just one second.
I wanted her... all right, but she-she didn't want me back.<eos> I would go to see her, and she would just brush me off.<eos> T-These journals, they were just a way for me to, like, work through that.<eos> They weren't, like, plans or anything.<eos> Okay, no-nobody was supposed to see those.<eos> It's a terrible invasion of privacy, and you must feel very violated.<eos> It's a shame that Janet's not here to commiserate with you.<eos> Someone choked her to death Tuesday night.<eos> Wait, Tu-Tuesday?<eos> What time on Tuesday?
It's a terrible invasion of privacy, and you must feel very violated.<eos> It's a shame that Janet's not here to commiserate with you.<eos> Someone choked her to death Tuesday night.<eos> Wait, Tu-Tuesday?<eos> What time on Tuesday?<eos> Specifically, we were hoping you could tell us.<eos> All we know is she disappeared somewhere between the end of roller derby practice at 7:00, and dinner with a friend at 10:00.<eos> She didn't show up.<eos> Okay, well, Tuesday, I was riding the A train.<eos> All night.
He needed to be hurt.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> I've decided I am gonna help you.<eos> By warning you, don't do this again.<eos> Or what?<eos> Or I'll prove it was you.<eos> I read the report on Hector's assault.<eos> You were careful.<eos> There's no evidence that you did it.<eos> But next time...
You're alive!<eos> Where is Ahmad?<eos> Kublai?<eos> What is it?<eos> Ahmad... our son... is a traitor.<eos> He betrayed us.<eos> To who?<eos> Kaidu.<eos> Pope.<eos> All of them.
Listen to your wife.<eos> Thank you, Mother, for letting me see him.<eos> No.<eos> But you've seemed so well, child.<eos> I am not.<eos> She is here.<eos> Always.<eos> There was this girl.<eos> I used to make deliveries to her family along the canals.<eos> Once a week, same time.
And as I pushed off the wall... each time, she'd say...<eos> "Until next week."<eos> I wonder if she's still there.<eos> You can't go back.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> Even if one day you do return to Venice, nothing will ever be as it was for you.<eos> Where are you attacking?<eos> When?<eos> My army stands ready.<eos> Just in case.

By whom?<eos> By the American ambassador.<eos> The ambassador has a gun to President Shwe's head.<eos> And this action seems to be linked to the trade agreement.<eos> Are we sure the gun is real?<eos> Where's a Buddhist even get a firearm?<eos> Probably brought it with him from when he was an average American citizen.<eos> Can we talk to him?<eos> He is demanding that we cancel the signing of the trade agreement.<eos> No discussion.
Hi, Don.<eos> Hi, Tina.<eos> Henry McCord.<eos> Come on in.<eos> So for all the inconvenience that a strong security detail may bring to the neighborhood, it also cuts crime rates in the following ways.<eos> A nine percent decrease in automobile break-ins.<eos> A 15% decrease in home break-ins...<eos> What about all the foot traffic from the tourists?<eos> Right.<eos> - Yeah, like every day.
Say what you're saying.<eos> This one is a gloss Cambridge finish, with swing bar hardware.<eos> It's $1,500.<eos> Maureen, what do you think?<eos> Let's talk about our life's glory package.<eos> Prayer cards, a memorial book.<eos> Uh, a word with you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can we reconsider cremation?<eos> Absolutely not.
Meanwhile, in Moldova, we have a group trying to buy uranium, something no other terrorist group has been able to do.<eos> Back in Saudi Arabia, we learn that Hizb Al-Shahid is targeting the family of Noura<eos> Al-Kitabi, and now, you're telling me that that's the same group that was trying to buy the uranium?<eos> Yeah, but both situations were contained.<eos> - What if it isn't?<eos> - What?<eos> What if their whole point was to put their main target right there in front us, while we all stand back and watch?<eos> - We have to shut it down.<eos> - What?<eos> The conference!
Now, that is predicamental.<eos> Wanted to give you an update.<eos> The map I was telling you about... to buried treasure, underground missile silos, whatever you were thinking.<eos> I wasn't thinking anything.<eos> The map's for Dany.<eos> Remember Dany?<eos> Client of Dany wants it.<eos> We don't know why and we don't care, because in exchange for this map,<eos> Dany's client's gonna give us some information.<eos> Some very interesting information indeed.
Okay!<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay!<eos> Forget her.<eos> I can't!<eos> Forget her.<eos> What happened?<eos> I told you to forget her.<eos> Forget who?<eos> - The girl.
Okay!<eos> Forget her.<eos> I can't!<eos> Forget her.<eos> What happened?<eos> I told you to forget her.<eos> Forget who?<eos> - The girl.<eos> - Which one?<eos> Which one?
"Serve him and you will go out in joy, be led forth in peace."<eos> Right.<eos> "The mountains and hills will burst into song before you. And all the trees in the field will clap their hands."<eos> I ask you now...<eos> Will you serve God?<eos> No.<eos> Will you serve God?<eos> Now, I heard you the first time.<eos> Will you serve Him?<eos> Oh, for Pete's sake.
Mommy?<eos> It's okay. That was just...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm sittin' in my car. What are you doing?<eos> You just broke my kid's art thing!<eos> So, yeah, nice job.<eos> What?<eos> I'll fix it.<eos> What?<eos> The art thing...
Wake up, Cassidy.<eos> Jesse's a preacher boy from West Texas.<eos> So what? !<eos> So tell him.<eos> If you really want to.<eos> See what he does.<eos> I bet I know a thing or two about him you don't.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like did you know he could make you do things just by telling you to?<eos> Not me.
Jesse?<eos> Jesse, whatever... is going on... whatever it is, or... whatever he did, or whatever it is that's going on...<eos> From... the day you came back here... first moment I saw you...<eos> I... just... believed in you.<eos> I believed in you.<eos> Well, that was stupid.<eos> Go home, Emily.<eos> Wake up. Jesse, wake up.<eos> Jesse?<eos> Under the bed... right now.
Well, where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna kill a man in Albuquerque.<eos> Better?<eos> Yeah, much.<eos> Thanks, Jackie.<eos> Maple syrup, Preacher?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Here.<eos> Merlot?<eos> For breakfast?
Heaven.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Heaven it is.<eos> Get the phone.<eos> Good thing, too.<eos> You have no idea what it's like down there, believe me.<eos> What is it?<eos> I put it under the bed.<eos> I know it.<eos> Under the bed?
Thank God.<eos> Heaven it is.<eos> Get the phone.<eos> Good thing, too.<eos> You have no idea what it's like down there, believe me.<eos> What is it?<eos> I put it under the bed.<eos> I know it.<eos> Under the bed?<eos> Under the bed? !
It's not safe... for you here.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> You killed the mayor.<eos> I'll kill you, too!<eos> I told you what I was.<eos> And now you see.<eos> You can leave.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> You saw me, too, Cassidy.<eos> The worst part of me.
To be a shepherd to your flock.<eos> To tend to them and the church.<eos> But I failed at that.<eos> So why did you give me this power if... if I can't use it to save them?<eos> You have not failed, my son.<eos> You brought them to me and so they are saved.<eos> Really?<eos> Even Eugene?<eos> Yes.<eos> Even him.
- A new house?<eos> - A maid.<eos> - New clothes?<eos> - Underclothes.<eos> - Shoes?<eos> - Stockings.<eos> Oh, Bumble!<eos> How we'll celebrate!<eos> - We'll have a party!<eos> - No, I...
When I was a child, my planet Krypton was dying.<eos> I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...
If I had just had a little more time,<eos> I could've brought her home.<eos> Brought her back.<eos> If Hank hadn't...<eos> Kara, there's something I need to tell you...<eos> - Just jumpy, I guess. - Yeah.<eos> It would be so easy to kill you.<eos> Get out.<eos> I need you to come with me.<eos> Not a chance.
We've got a rogue.<eos> Fort Rozz prisoner number 2444.<eos> He's been hiding out in National City using a human alias, Gabriel Phillips.<eos> Surveillance spotted him yesterday.<eos> Don't be fooled by the pretty face, this thing is nasty.<eos> Feeds off rotting flesh.<eos> He's been spotted coming and going from an abandoned warehouse downtown, where we suspect he's storing his food.<eos> Proceed with caution when apprehending him.<eos> This one bites.<eos> On my three.
It's Kara.<eos> How's it going, Siobhan?<eos> I have difficulty making conversation with men under six feet tall.<eos> Is that for Ms. Grant?<eos> For her eyes only.<eos> Ms. Grant, uh, likes for everything to be open before it reaches her desk.<eos> I spent the last 90 minutes in the mail room letting a glorified postal worker stare at my chest, so I could be the one to give this to Cat.<eos> And I'll take the credit.<eos> Tweedledee. Staff meeting.<eos> Everyone in my office.
Liberty Avenue.<eos> There's about to be a major crash.<eos> Supergirl, get to Liberty Avenue now.<eos> Dozens of banks and lending institutions, including National City Mutual, released a statement calling this the worst digital data breach<eos> - they have ever seen.<eos> - National City Mutual.<eos> That's where my retirement fund is.<eos> If this hacker isn't stopped soon, we're looking at a worldwide economic collapse.<eos> Relevant people!<eos> In my office.
We're going to have to work on that.<eos> What about J'onn?<eos> What do I call you?<eos> My name is J'onn J'onzz.<eos> Is Hank Henshaw dead?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you kill him?<eos> (SIGHING)<eos> I've always been afraid of aliens.<eos> My whole life.
Yes, I am.<eos> I'm with you.<eos> I am.<eos> I see you.<eos> Take his hand.<eos> Now, I want you to lead him.<eos> Lead him to The Truth.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> Back in time.<eos> Here.
And why is it precious?<eos> - Brings us to The Light. - To The Light.<eos> Ah!<eos> You're doing good.<eos> Sarah's an easy person to love, isn't she?<eos> First time you saw her, did you think anything sexually?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Is there anything different about the way that you thought sexually about her than any other woman than you think sexually about?<eos> Come on.<eos> The truth.
Hey, Felicia.<eos> I was just about to leave.<eos> I'm sorry we haven't had a chance to catch up properly.<eos> I've been so busy getting ready for tomorrow.<eos> Let me take something off your plate.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No need.<eos> I think we're all set now.<eos> Well, thank you for putting everything together.<eos> - Of course.
Well, of course he likes you.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> Not... not just outside.<eos> Inside.<eos> You're bursting with Light, Mary.<eos> Well, we haven't had sex yet.<eos> Oh, no?<eos> Mm-mm. But... he kisses me a lot.<eos> Where?<eos> First, my neck.
Inside.<eos> You're bursting with Light, Mary.<eos> Well, we haven't had sex yet.<eos> Oh, no?<eos> Mm-mm. But... he kisses me a lot.<eos> Where?<eos> First, my neck.<eos> No, no.<eos> My mouth.<eos> My lips.
- You are? - Kara Danvers.<eos> - (KNUCKLES CRACK) - Oh! Wow.<eos> That's uh, quite a firm handshake you got going on there.<eos> Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)<eos> Well, I, I work out.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I mean, um, I read in this article somewhere that when you're going in for a big interview you should start with a firm shake.<eos> Yes.<eos> Um, interview?<eos> What job?
It'll protect us from Silver Banshee's yelly voice.<eos> James just called.<eos> Livewire and Silver Banshee kidnapped Cat.<eos> Hello, Red and Blue.<eos> Come to National City Park now if you don't want Cat's blood all over your hands or all over the street.<eos> You don't have to do this, Barry.<eos> This is my fight.<eos> One for all and all for...<eos> You guys have Three Musketeers here, right?<eos> All for one.
I think James Olsen thinks so, too.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> You remember before when I told you to take things slow?<eos> That's good advice for a superhero, lousy advice for two people who really like each other.<eos> Maybe it's time to speed things up.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Come here.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> On your marks...
KARA: When I was a child, my planet Krypton was dying.<eos> I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> KARA: Previously on Supergirl...
This is the inevitability of Myriad.<eos> Non, stop this!<eos> These are your friends, aren't they?<eos> Let them go.<eos> I've have lived with loss.<eos> Allow me to return the favor.<eos> CAT: Kelly?<eos> What are you doing to them?<eos> Non has ended crime in National City in one day.<eos> One second.
But that would have spared her the agony of losing everyone she loves.<eos> I thought it would please you.<eos> You've always known how to please me.<eos> Now, it's time for us to consider what's next.<eos> Next, we go to Metropolis.<eos> Then to Opal City, Central City,<eos> Washington D.C.<eos> You sound like a cut-rate politician running for office.<eos> The small dreams of a small man.<eos> Not worthy of you.
More lives lost?<eos> You hated me for months, because you thought I'd use my power indiscriminately, kill people with no regard for their lives.<eos> That is exactly the choice you're making with this bomb.<eos> Please tell me you've had enough analysis to know that she's right.<eos> You were afraid of me.<eos> Now you're afraid of Non.<eos> I understand that fear.<eos> But we cannot let it drive our actions.<eos> Make another choice that honors your parents.<eos> And mine.

Hmm.<eos> Oh, this thing has nothing to do with me.<eos> All good. I got other things.<eos> - You kissed me.<eos> - I kissed you.<eos> You did.<eos> So, I'm sorry if I kissed you when you weren't in control of yourself, because I am all about consent.<eos> (CHUCKLES) I know.<eos> I was myself.<eos> Mostly.
Still happening?<eos> Everyone's been protected.<eos> No one's mind is being controlled.<eos> But I went to see how much damage the Kryptonians had done to my LTE network and I found out that since we ended their mind control, the Myriad wave has been amplified ten-fold and is rising exponentially.<eos> Amplified?<eos> To what end?<eos> Emergency rooms all over the city have been filled with people complaining about headaches.<eos> They're from Myriad, which, by my calculations, will continue to amplify until pop goes the cranium.<eos> The Kryptonians couldn't control us, so instead, they're going to kill us.<eos> All of us.
- Don't be.<eos> Max Lord says he's very close to finding the source of the Myriad wave, and once he does, I'll have my mission.<eos> James Olsen called Lucy to tell her that you've been acting strange, like you were saying goodbye or something.<eos> I didn't mean to worry him.<eos> I just...<eos> We both know what I'm up against.<eos> I will save the Earth, I promise you that.<eos> I just don't know if I'll make it out alive.<eos> I didn't say the things that needed to be said when I left Krypton and I wanted to make sure that I said them now.<eos> Just in case.
It's just a means to an end.<eos> Its power comes from her.<eos> Can't smash that to little bits, huh?<eos> This is not what Astra wanted.<eos> Please, don't kill everyone.<eos> Your aunt wanted to save this planet.<eos> The humans' extinction will do just that.<eos> Like Noah after the flood.<eos> Only without Noah.<eos> Or you.
Do the trick.<eos> ALEX: Come here, come here.<eos> WINN: Do the trick.<eos> (ALL CHUCKLING)<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Three, two, one!<eos> (ALL CHEER)<eos> - Let's have a toast. - JAMES:<eos> All right.<eos> - To Supergirl.
(ALL CHUCKLING)<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Three, two, one!<eos> (ALL CHEER)<eos> - Let's have a toast. - JAMES:<eos> All right.<eos> - To Supergirl.<eos> - No, no.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> To family.
Three, two, one!<eos> (ALL CHEER)<eos> - Let's have a toast. - JAMES:<eos> All right.<eos> - To Supergirl.<eos> - No, no.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> To family.<eos> Love bonds us all.<eos> ALL: To family!
Where's the princess?<eos> In the cockpit with Hera.<eos> We've completed our search of the transports and found no contraband.<eos> Very well, Corporal.<eos> Yes?<eos> Sir, my squad was ambushed by rebels.<eos> They escaped with the fugitive Ryder Azadi.<eos> What?<eos> They also abducted a cadet.<eos> And some princess ambassador.
What?<eos> They also abducted a cadet.<eos> And some princess ambassador.<eos> She's under our protection.<eos> Deploy search patrols, now!<eos> I owe you my life.<eos> You have my gratitude.<eos> It's the least we could do after leading the Empire right to you.<eos> We heard what happened.<eos> Sorry, kid.
But to get close to the ships, we'll need a distraction.<eos> I can handle that.<eos> The Ghost can act as air support.<eos> And I can use detonators to blast off the gravity locks.<eos> Won't work.<eos> You can't forcibly remove the locks.<eos> You know this how?<eos> In prison I put those locks together, so I know how to take 'em apart.<eos> Ryder Azadi, does that mean you're getting involved?<eos> Just this once.
Ohh.<eos> You okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> So...<eos> How do you feel?<eos> It felt like... Just another kill.<eos> It didn't bring my parents back.<eos> Nothing will.<eos> What now? Law school?<eos> No.
- It's cute.<eos> You will not call me Millie.<eos> Millie is the girl I left behind in Bakersfield and I busted my ass not to be her.<eos> So you're not glad to see your brother?<eos> Oh, Linus.<eos> Sweet, sheltered, raised-in-a-stable-home Linus.<eos> I guess a small part of me is glad, but most of me knows when Theo shows up, trouble follows.<eos> We left him alone in our house.<eos> He wouldn't dare steal from me.<eos> - From you, maybe.

Interesting.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I was working from memory.<eos> If I had my laptop, I could access my notes.<eos> I live like two blocks away from here. Do you want to use mine?<eos> - Is it that urgent? - It's just that my colleagues are out in the field and I'd like to tell them if they're barking up the wrong tree.<eos> Okay, sounds like a plan.<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Sure.
Let me get that.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Hey, um,<eos> I feel really safe with you here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Of course.<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey. You know, I'm thinking out loud. As-as long as we're having wine...<eos> Oh, cheers, by the way.

No, no, no, Paula.<eos> With all due respect, you did not see his face when he left my apartment that day.<eos> I was dead to him, like, he didn't want to spend any more time with me, and, oh, we were getting so close.<eos> You know?<eos> And you will again.<eos> I promise you, I'm gonna fix this.<eos> By the end of day tomorrow, Josh will have asked you out to dinner.<eos> What?<eos> What, tomorrow?<eos> Dinner?
Um, there's a problem.<eos> Oh right, I'm-I'm sorry, my mistake,<eos> Josh mentioned that you, uh, weren't on the lease.<eos> Josh, you told her?<eos> You know how sensitive I am about the lease.<eos> It's-it's okay.<eos> We can just make Josh the sole plaintiff, no biggie.<eos> A-And then we can make thousands of dollars.<eos> R-right, Rebecca?<eos> Yes, at least.

The mature rational side of me knows that you're not a jerk.<eos> You just don't feel the same way about me that I do about you.<eos> But, so the emotional side of me wants to spear you through the eye with this dart.<eos> Okay, I see.<eos> What... can I do?<eos> What would make this better?<eos> You are just gonna have to live with the uncertainty.<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna be sad and angry, and you're just gonna have to live with it.<eos> Because I'm not quitting this job.<eos> Not this time.
I need you to remain quite... still.<eos> Day or two... he'll be gone.<eos> Navvies are all cut from t'same cloth.<eos> They all wear the same, walk the same, cuss the same. Easy to lose yourself in a crowd.<eos> So you think Killeen has slipped the net.<eos> There is a chance he'd make for port.<eos> Find a berth overseas.<eos> Easy way to be sure.<eos> Telegraph port authorities.<eos> Liverpool.
Missed your chance to talk me out of it (! )<eos> I had to endure a lecture.<eos> My uncle seems to think the pair of us are fools.<eos> I had to endure the same lecture.<eos> From my housekeeper, no less.<eos> - And? What did you say?<eos> - I told her this was business.<eos> - Thru'pence.<eos> - What?<eos> - For that measly little bag?
Oh, and tell your girl she's NOT to go up on that stage any more.<eos> You try telling her anything.<eos> Hang on, hang on. It'll keep.<eos> It's a fine day's work.<eos> I'll be wanting supplies for tomorrow.<eos> You'll struggle to keep up with me.<eos> Can you have your young grocery clerk deliver first thing in the morning?<eos> I need a shin of beef.<eos> Shall we say... seven shillings?<eos> A shilling more than yesterday?
You're telling me he's a gentleman.<eos> How long you planning to live like this?<eos> No-one else would know this place.<eos> Shanty folk don't want me.<eos> Nor my family, neither.<eos> Look at you!<eos> Come here.<eos> I was always the captain.<eos> How far did we travel, eh?<eos> Australia?

George!<eos> Get up to the scaffold, there's empty pitchers to be collected.<eos> - All right. I'm just going to finish off doing this ...<eos> - George, I said get!<eos> It's best he ain't here.<eos> Begging your pardon, sir. Ma'am.<eos> - I need to speak with you.<eos> - What is it, Coates?<eos> A woman came to me and complained...<eos> about yonder gentleman.
- I know as much as all you do.<eos> - So you'd say?<eos> - If you knew something?<eos> - Aye.<eos> But I don't.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Like we're supposed to trust your brother?<eos> Dagger.<eos> We're good for the money, as soon as Blackwood gives us what's owed.<eos> - Only those with cash.
They'll find nothing they're not looking for, then we'll get rid of Red before work on the quarry starts.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Then that's an end to it.<eos> I promise.<eos> There's nothing safe around here, not even the dead.<eos> It's business.<eos> A man takes an opportunity where he gets it.<eos> - Johnny's just taking his.<eos> - He's a right to it.<eos> At my expense?
I don't want you wandering about alone out there.<eos> - Mam, what is going on? - (KNOCK AT DOOR)<eos> POLLY: Hello, love.<eos> I'm just after a quick word with your mam.<eos> Come in.<eos> I thought you might need a friend with all that's going on.<eos> You two, wait out there.<eos> But don't think about stepping off that porch.<eos> Can I count on you, Polly, as a friend?<eos> In the truest sense of the word?
She don't know nothing about it!<eos> Don't bet on it.<eos> Where there's trouble, Alma'll find it.<eos> - You're right there, Joe.<eos> - Aye.<eos> All I ever hear talk of is your mam's cooking.<eos> What's the big secret, then, eh, George?<eos> Secret?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The ingredient.
I've built a business. And I'm determined to stay a part of it.<eos> You'll be seeing me again.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello.<eos> Anybody there?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What is this money you've been keeping?<eos> Tell me didn't you steal it.<eos> I was given it as payment.<eos> Honest work.
Let us be united in grief, on equal terms, for someone we all loved.<eos> I'll be here for a few days after the funeral before I return to New York.<eos> Perhaps we might find time to see one another.<eos> For lunch, or a walk.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'd like that very much.<eos> Your Majesties.<eos> - We must go, girls.<eos> - So soon?<eos> Yes, to Westminster Hall.
- Oh, I inherited it from my grandfather.<eos> Well, as you know, Kaiser Wilhelm was not blessed with a normal physique.<eos> No, the withered arm.<eos> Ah, but he loved to shoot, so modifications had to be made.<eos> They didn't modify a shotgun, they modified a cannon.<eos> You are a cheat, Hannover.<eos> I realize that, beyond these walls, the country mourns, struggles under a program of austerity and rationing but, what to do?<eos> It might all appear indulgent but, in keeping the estate and the local community going, we are all doing our share tonight for the economy.<eos> So, let us start with a toast.<eos> - To His late Majesty, the King.
The appropriate title for the woman I married.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Her Royal Highness.<eos> She is, after all, the wife of a former King.<eos> She's also a woman who has three husbands that still live and breathe.<eos> It is her right, Winston.<eos> I'm determined she shall have it.<eos> I'm determined she is shown respect.<eos> Will you fight for it?<eos> One more time?
Your own flesh and blood.<eos> Well, I would've done if they'd accepted the woman I love.<eos> But they didn't, so I don't.<eos> So the former King keeps himself at a distance.<eos> A distance that was imposed upon me.<eos> They wanted me out.<eos> And reduces us all to cruel nicknames.<eos> Shirley Temple.<eos> Uh... Yes.<eos> On account of the curls?

Yes.<eos> On account of the curls?<eos> And precociousness.
- I did, too.<eos> Obviously, not hard enough.<eos> No.<eos> You never apologized.<eos> To your papa, I most certainly did.<eos> Your mother too.<eos> I can show you the letters.<eos> I didn't mean to them.<eos> I meant to me.<eos> You?
Come in.<eos> I'm practicing for the big day tomorrow and I need an Archbishop.<eos> Will you do me the honour?<eos> From here.<eos> "Is Your Majesty willing to take the oath?"<eos> I am... willing.<eos> "Will you maintain and preserve in... invi..."<eos> Ah. Inviolably.<eos> It means... to make a promise you can... you can never break.<eos> A very sacred promise indeed.
Telling me that, in his opinion, she was in her final days now, and my sister and I should make our way over.<eos> With me?<eos> Probably best without.<eos> Even if she dies?<eos> Let's hope she does.<eos> Couldn't bear to go over twice.<eos> I shall have to be brave.<eos> My darling one.<eos> And go without you.<eos> To cold London.

The decision is yours to make.<eos> We will take our lead from you.<eos> We just wondered if you might be available for a brief moment in the vestry.<eos> Alright.<eos> - What is this?<eos> Hide and seek?<eos> - I told you not to overstep the mark.<eos> I made it clear, carte blanche or nothing at all.<eos> Trade Unionists and businessmen?<eos> In the Abbey?
Oh, thank you, Bob.<eos> A tired anachronistic institution has rejuvenated, a nation is liberated from the austerity of rationing and war, our place as a leading power in the world has re-established when it seemed to be slipping.<eos> What a load of bollocks.<eos> - Snifter?<eos> - I shouldn't.<eos> - Oh, go on.<eos> It's nearly lunchtime.<eos> - Papers, sir.<eos> - Thanks, Mary.<eos> - My job.
It's nearly lunchtime.<eos> - Papers, sir.<eos> - Thanks, Mary.<eos> - My job.<eos> - It's Princess Margaret.<eos> - What about her?<eos> Leaving the Abbey on the day of the coronation, I saw her picking a piece of fluff off a man's uniform.<eos> - Fluff?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Fluff.
Well, actually, I was thinking of legal reasons.<eos> Marriage isn't regarded as a sacrament in the Church of Scotland.<eos> It is not as binding in the same way as here.<eos> Meaning, meaning we could even get married in a church?<eos> Well, I'd have to check, but I think so.<eos> That would be so lovely.<eos> - Lilibet, thank you so much.<eos> - It would make my life a lot easier too.<eos> - Sorry, Lilibet.<eos> - What for?
- Tommy.<eos> - Your Majesty.<eos> Mummy.<eos> This is a surprise.<eos> I am a mother of two daughters whom I love equally.<eos> It seems that they each have problems of equal size.<eos> Obviously, we want Margaret to be happy, to have the man she wants.<eos> Yes.<eos> But we must do everything in our power to protect you as Queen.<eos> - And as a sister.
Tick, tick, tick.<eos> Bon voyage.<eos> A tiny white community, surrounded by primitive Africans, grew into a young and flourishing nation with the ever brightening promise of more prosperity before it.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> We honour a man of remarkable vision, who saw how great this land could become, once civilized.<eos> I wish continued prosperity and success to all those who inhabit it.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for the royal courtesy.<eos> Telegram for Princess Margaret.<eos> - The Queen!

Thank you, Titus.<eos> John.<eos> That's a nuclear fuel cell, John.<eos> You'll irradiate the entire city.<eos> So, how do we destroy it?<eos> Carefully.<eos> Where's Jasper?<eos> Saying good-bye to his new friend.<eos> Sorry, Cap. You gotta take them back.<eos> Your gear.
Give me it!<eos> Get down!<eos> Open it!<eos> Open the register.<eos> I'm going as fast as I can.<eos> Well, go a little faster!<eos> I have a family...<eos> Yeah, well, I have a family, too, okay?<eos> And I'm gonna count to three, and if that cash register isn't open, I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.<eos> One!
I feel like I do that every day.<eos> It's a drop in the bucket compared to what you could be accomplishing with a little more visibility.<eos> I can tell you have the right touch.<eos> I'm not sure what kind of touch that is.<eos> Let's get real.<eos> You have the potential to do big things in this department, but being partnered with a Reagan is holding you back.<eos> Why is that?<eos> The PC can't afford to be seen as favoring his son's partner.<eos> You need another hook.<eos> You?
When I was ten, I saw that guy stomp a boy to death in front of my building.<eos> ♪♪ Blue Bloods 6x13 ♪ Stomping Grounds Original Air Date on January 22, 2016<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Did the sitter work out?<eos> Oh, she's great.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Oh, happy to help.<eos> Forgotten, but not gone.<eos> How was Harrison's racket?<eos> Lively, but not a moment too soon.
Unlawful eviction.<eos> Can't throw your tenants out without proper notice.<eos> Hey, Marco, what is this, a joke?<eos> No, I'm not joking.<eos> I'm dead serious.<eos> Now get your ass up.<eos> Not you, jackass.<eos> Sit down.<eos> No, you hold it right there.<eos> Hell to the no.

Yeah, this is bullcrap.<eos> Unlawful eviction is a misdemeanor.<eos> So give me your worthless little summons and let me go.<eos> Can't do that.<eos> We're not finished yet.<eos> Look out now.<eos> Here comes the heavy artillery.<eos> How you doing, shady lady?<eos> I didn't catch your name before.<eos> What about her?
A full half of them black.<eos> Like him.<eos> You're not the judge or the jury.<eos> The district attorney is going to make you a generous offer.<eos> Take the plea.<eos> And you're not my boss anymore, either.<eos> Well, it's just a piece of advice.<eos> Not an order.<eos> Now... the police officer outside will escort you downstairs and out of this building.<eos> For the last time.
Except for the guy sitting next to him, 9C... ugh.<eos> What was wrong with him?<eos> He never got why Bunt v. Che was a relevant precedent.<eos> Also he wheezed... a lot.<eos> Like the door of a haunted house.<eos> He has asthma.<eos> We can find that guy and see if he knows anything.<eos> I used to peddle inhalers.<eos> What color was his?<eos> Oh, uh... red.
I have the exact same antlers.<eos> That's not me.<eos> You can tell by how fast she's moving.<eos> Know what's not moving fast?<eos> Our construction.<eos> Yeah, we had to fire Oleg's cousin.<eos> Turns out the sexual tension was still there.<eos> Hey body... not so much.<eos> Yeah, so it's gonna take at least another week.<eos> A week?
Sir?<eos> I'm sorry, I have diabetes.<eos> And I'm not stupid.<eos> Move it along.<eos> It's not a scam!<eos> My friends and I just want to place to play baseball after school so we're not hanging on the streets like rap people.<eos> Kid, I started the candy scam.<eos> I raised $500 for a homeless bowling league, AKA pot.<eos> Catch this, Mr. Baseball.<eos> Not the face!
Good.<eos> Thank you for what you did at the studio.<eos> How did you know that I'd snap out of it and not shoot you?<eos> I didn't.<eos> But we've been in each other's minds.<eos> I know you better than you think.<eos> Hey, uh... do you wanna do something tonight?<eos> I can't.<eos> Okay. That's okay.<eos> Uh... another time.
Canadian dicks.<eos> Mexican criminals are so much more courteous.<eos> Until they make you dig your own grave.<eos> How are we gonna get this in the car?<eos> Good for you.<eos> You spotted the problem.<eos> Well, I guess the first thing we do is walk it over there.<eos> Yep, I guess.<eos> Okay.<eos> On the count of three.
Rock it up and spin, spin, spin.<eos> Whoa! Rock it up and spin, spin, spin.<eos> This is fun.<eos> You've never had actual fun, have you?<eos> ... spin, spin, spin.<eos> Oh, oh! Girl power!<eos> Oh! Stupid men would've probably just backed the car up to the barrel.<eos> What?<eos> Okay.<eos> On the count of three.
Where's your father?<eos> He escaped back to his men.<eos> Good.<eos> Let him burn with them.<eos> A Mongol without a horse... is like a hawk without wings!<eos> The bodies of those mighty mares may burn in the fire below.<eos> But their noble souls look down on each and every one of you... from the Eternal Blue Sky above.<eos> They look down, and they demand their sacrifice was not in vain.<eos> Ride down there and prove it!<eos> Attack! Hyah!
One rules, one dies.<eos> If you die, it's over.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> We'll make Genghis proud, Father.<eos> Go!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Jingim.<eos> Cousins.<eos> Stop dancing, Prince... and fight me!<eos> Attack!
Come with me.<eos> Come home.<eos> Kaidu?<eos> We're searching.<eos> And Nayan?<eos> I had to make a choice.<eos> I chose my faith.<eos> What god asks you to choose between himself and your blood?<eos> Then asks you to turn my son against me?<eos> Your son?
I didn't steal it.<eos> Oh, I see where this is going.<eos> You complain and complain, I make the problem go away, and you had nothing to do with it.<eos> I didn't ask for this.<eos> I didn't ask for any of this.<eos> Let's not turn on each other.<eos> It'll make us sloppy.<eos> I need your help to get rid of it.<eos> God knows I've already tried.<eos> Son of a...

You have the twins, a spotless house, Killer yoga arms.<eos> Aw.<eos> Unh-unh.<eos> This happens all the time --<eos> They get on their track to success, and you become the invisible housewife.<eos> I don't know about all the time.<eos> Sitting with all those gals, I thought,<eos> "wow, this is an insane amount of perfume.<eos> And also, am I on my way to becoming an invisible housewife?"<eos> No way.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> We left together on Friday night.<eos> And went where?<eos> Back to my place.<eos> We messed around.<eos> I...<eos> I got a little pushy.<eos> Sometimes she liked that.<eos> But not this time?
-That's fantastic.<eos> -It'll be fun.<eos> -She's sleeping again.<eos> -This apartment is fantastic.<eos> -We just started looking.<eos> -No, we've looked at least thirty.<eos> We could wait until Emma leaves home, so we can stay here.<eos> -I already saw the apartment once.<eos> -We're going to the extra showing tomorrow.<eos> -What time?
-Damn it.<eos> -Did you?<eos> -Did they mention Wivel?<eos> The journalist?<eos> -No...<eos> -We have to lay low for a while.<eos> -Don't talk to the police again.<eos> -They'll be back.<eos> -Go away somewhere. -Okay.<eos> With what money?
You touched on it yourself.<eos> Even I can see how close they are to each other<eos> -What did Anna say?<eos> -She denies it, of course.<eos> Did you ever confront Jakob with your suspicions?<eos> No, I didn't think that would change anything.<eos> -And did you threaten him?<eos> -No, and I didn't kill him.<eos> When were you in his apartment?<eos> Last Monday.
Should I get help?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> And you go to the toilet.<eos> If you get help, I'll kill him!<eos> Karpinger has kidnapped my son.<eos> Where are they hiding him?<eos> -No idea!<eos> -You worked for him!<eos> -That was a long time ago!<eos> -Six months ago!
Martin believes that Kangas is hiding in Tanto.<eos> -I'm coming with you.<eos> -Good.<eos> Your father is coming to get you soon.<eos> Isn't that good?<eos> -Down there on the right.<eos> -Oskar! Take it easy.<eos> -Police!<eos> Show me your hands!<eos> Down on your knees!
Shoot me!<eos> Karpinger!<eos> Kill me!<eos> Shoot me, Karpinger!<eos> Kill me!<eos> No!<eos> Shoot me, damn it!<eos> This is how it works if you try to fuck me!<eos> Dad!<eos> Down on your knees!

Do you know how many people with munchies are gonna pass this place on the way to Coachella?<eos> We'll open the truck right here and sell your amazing food to pay for the repairs.<eos> It's going to be awesome.<eos> Wow.<eos> You know, you're really sexy when you take charge.<eos> Okay, that time, it kind of worked.<eos> (Sofia) Whoo-hoo-hoo!<eos> Thanks for letting me drive.<eos> - This is so exci...<eos> - Eyes on the road.
I've seen it my whole life.<eos> We gotta find them.<eos> - Sofia, why are we slowing down? - I don't...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm flooring it!<eos> Sofia, we're out of gas!<eos> Why didn't you say something?<eos> Well, considering I don't even have a driver's license,<eos> I think I'm doing pretty good.<eos> Okay, kids.
It is happening.<eos> And it's real.<eos> I'm not dreaming?<eos> Here, pinch me.<eos> It's not a dream!<eos> Do you know how long I've waited for this?<eos> A year and three months, roughly.<eos> Wait, what if something goes wrong?<eos> I mean, every time we've been close to getting together, - something happens.<eos> - Not this time.
I know.<eos> Elijah, there was a golf app on Scott Barrett's phone.<eos> It syncs with a device to help you perfect your swing.<eos> The app communicates with the club.<eos> Right. It records path, speed, angle and impact.<eos> But the device that was attached to Barrett's club was also equipped with GPS tracking.<eos> It gave you the location of the murder weapon?<eos> Yup.<eos> Team One, let's go.<eos> Over on the left side.
Duty calls, huh?<eos> Go, Jack.<eos> Hey. Love you.<eos> Love you.<eos> Dinner tonight. I promise.<eos> Hey, Doug.<eos> This is detective Costello.<eos> How did the "Remington Steele" audition go?<eos> I didn't get it.<eos> Their loss.
Thank you, thank you, man, thank you.<eos> And I'll tweet, but only if I like it, all right?<eos> I only have 48 followers, but it's growing.<eos> - No doubt, no doubt.<eos> - Some tastemakers in there so...<eos> I feel you, I feel you. - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Yo, I appreciate it, man, really.<eos> - You guys have a good day.<eos> - Yeah, you too.
It's, like, two years ago or something, and I came out of the lavatory and there you were.<eos> Judging by your build and your denim jacket, I just assumed you were an old Native American man.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> "Sir"? I'm obviously a beautiful woman, dude.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.<eos> Can we just start over?<eos> I'm Matt Sherman.<eos> Matt Sherman. Why does that sound so familiar?<eos> Oh, were you on the jury for my public urination trial?<eos> Thanks for nothing, by the way. No, sadly that...
How about you leave me well and far alone?<eos> You're no use to us anymore.<eos> That isn't true.<eos> No, it isn't true.<eos> You were never any use to us.<eos> You're being cruel.<eos> I thought you wanted me.<eos> Wanted you?<eos> No one has ever wanted you.<eos> Not your own father, nor the Essex hive, and certainly not I.
You must stay in this world a little longer.<eos> But to what end?<eos> All is lost, Mary.<eos> You...<eos> Me him.<eos> Where is he?<eos> John, where is our son?<eos> It's, uh... Witch.<eos> Cotton gave him to a witch.<eos> Who?
Leelah.<eos> Leelah Strawn.<eos> Franklin and me were going out, and I didn't hear from him for a couple of days, so I-I came over.<eos> What happened?<eos> He's been murdered.<eos> Franklin?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> So, uh, did he have any threats against him recently?<eos> Franklin?
That's right.<eos> That's right. And down here we've got barium, - antimony, and lead.<eos> - Gunshot residue.<eos> That's why he didn't eat the pizza-- because he was dead.<eos> So he was shot by the pizza delivery guy?<eos> That's my bet.<eos> Thanks, old friend.<eos> I'll miss you.<eos> Uh, yeah, I know Holt.<eos> Uh, the name, anyway.
Come on.<eos> We're not done.<eos> Hey, you ever think about getting an avocado tree?<eos> Like, it might solve some problems.<eos> We're in the middle of a drought, Ryan.<eos> Those take so much water, it's not even funny.<eos> [Sighs] No, not the pintos.<eos> We have to go, Ryan.<eos> Why? I just gotta go, 'cause I'm not even allowed to be in here.<eos> Legally.
I don't know.<eos> Hey! Just be careful with it.<eos> - I'm telling you.<eos> - Come on, Sash.<eos> Put it down.<eos> All right.<eos> Don't do that!<eos> - Ah! - Jesus.<eos> Do you know who that thing belongs to?<eos> Odin!
All right.<eos> Where do I bring it?<eos> Just put the phone down, all right?<eos> It's not yours.<eos> You look good.<eos> Bitch.<eos> - Hey, who do you call, huh?<eos> - What?<eos> Who do you call to save us, huh?<eos> A friend.
Siéntate.<eos> I came all the way here to interview in person.<eos> See her house, to feel her...<eos> I know she's a lot of people's idol.<eos> I like your jacket.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I made it.<eos> She would have loved it.<eos> Who?
There could be a thousand reasons why they didn't come, but these people did.<eos> Your passion to help one person helped five more.<eos> Doesn't that count?<eos> Well, of course.<eos> But what's gonna happen to Pati?<eos> She learned her first word thanks to you.<eos> My guess is, she'll be hungry for more.<eos> I'd better go.<eos> It was really nice meeting you.<eos> You, too.
Looks like you're making progress.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Should be able to do this a lot faster.<eos> You miss it, your speed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Surprising how much.<eos> So what will you do when you go back to your Earth?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Guess I'll just have to get used to being...<eos> Normal?
There's nothing.<eos> Hey. Lay off him, Haas.<eos> Hey, I just want him to be prepared... 'cause he knows what he did.<eos> You should have stayed in Salt Lake, boy.<eos> Hey, don't let him get to you.<eos> Yeah, and whatever he's found, the FBI already knew about it, right?<eos> Come on.<eos> Investigation is over.<eos> Now it's time to move on...<eos> to the interview.
The Hybrid destined to conquer Gallifrey and stand in its ruins... .. is me.<eos> The Hybrid.<eos> I think it's time to tell the truth.<eos> I heard the Doctor had come home.<eos> One so loves fireworks.<eos> What's he up to?<eos> The Hybrid is a creature thought to be crossbred from two warrior races.<eos> I know I went too far.<eos> You have broken every code you ever lived by.<eos> On my command!
Aim at the Doctor.<eos> - Fire on my command.<eos> - Sir?<eos> Step forward and take aim!<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Lord President... he's a war hero.<eos> - Some of these men served with him.<eos> - These men serve me!<eos> All of you!<eos> On my command...
- I'm sorry, but we have to find a way to extract you...<eos> - I said, stay back!<eos> The Hybrid, what is it?<eos> What's so important you would fight so long?<eos> It doesn't matter what the Hybrid is.<eos> It only matters that I convinced them that I knew.<eos> Otherwise, I'd have had nothing left to bargain with.<eos> - What were you bargaining for?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> You.
Just, please, as my BFF, help me get through this party.<eos> Adam is so looking forward to it, and he's probably sitting in traffic on the 405.<eos> Fine.<eos> This means so much to me, Jenna.<eos> I hated when she pulled the BFF card, but this time, there were going to be limits.<eos> Fine, but it ends tomorrow.<eos> No more living in your deranged wedding fantasy land.<eos> Tomorrow is truth and reality land.<eos> So where are we having this thing?<eos> - Your house.
His job now is taking care of her, taking care of Rosemary.<eos> You know, she's the one that would really know what to do with all this.<eos> The smartest one of the bunch.<eos> And tough, too. Jesus.<eos> No, that's why I want her out there.<eos> I want her in California.<eos> I want her to go to college.<eos> I want her to have a decent life.<eos> Not live in this shit with the rest of us.<eos> Off to the airport, then?
- You will?<eos> All right, get your stuff together.<eos> We're gonna meet in three hours.<eos> We're gonna leave from here.<eos> Now, I don't want you talking to a soul between now and then.<eos> - Do you hear me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Listen.<eos> I love you.<eos> Not a soul.
What about... this... this lamp?<eos> You know? I mean, I love this lamp.<eos> I bought that lamp last week.<eos> Well, it already means the world to me.<eos> Okay, then I will take it with me, along with all of our memories.<eos> Except for the memories that we haven't made yet.<eos> I mean, we always said when I had kids, they'd come to spend weekends and Christmases here.<eos> Now they can spend them at my new condo.<eos> Condo?<eos> Condon't.
I wondered if you had it in you.<eos> Your old man would be proud.<eos> Come on.<eos> Brought tacos.<eos> Unfinished business?<eos> Is that what you're in hiding from?<eos> You and your mother.<eos> Silence always means yes.<eos> You take after her in that way.<eos> In every way.
Hey buddy, I'm really sorry about your uncle.<eos> I'm sorry to both of you.<eos> I feel like this is all my fault, and I have no idea how to stop it, and it doesn't feel very good.<eos> Oh, come on Ash. You?<eos> You're not responsible.<eos> Oh, he definitely is though.<eos> Like, like 100%.<eos> You know what? Probably more.<eos> I like you better when you were possessed.<eos> Yeah, me too.
We need to lock that shit up, right now.<eos> So, do you need anything else, or are you good?<eos> Oh, I'm good.<eos> Nancy, are you good?<eos> Ah, I'm okay. Sure.<eos> I have a friend mine, Nancy.<eos> He strings tennis rackets for a living.<eos> He is the best.<eos> He can't do anything else, but where do the worlds' tennis pros go to get their rackets strung?<eos> Him.
I'd do me, all day long.<eos> There you are, baby.<eos> Right on time.<eos> You know they say waitresses don't get big tips. Well, that's about to change.<eos> State Police.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> Lady, you just don't quit?<eos> Not after what you did to my partner.<eos> Partner?
Hello, Hector.<eos> What happened to your face?<eos> That looks like my mom's chicharrones.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> You can tell it to La Reina.<eos> Put him in the trunk, huh?<eos> You two, you're in charge now. Si, Senor.<eos> Burn the greenhouse down with Batch 47.<eos> We need to get back to our core mission. You understand me?<eos> Si, Senor.
As long as our daughter is dating that boy, he is welcome in this house.<eos> Mom.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> How is this gonna work?<eos> How do I date a guy that my parents hate?<eos> You father's relationship with Larry has nothing to do with you two.<eos> We'll work it out.<eos> And by the way,<eos> I really like Mingo.<eos> Me, too.
About what?<eos> Number one, this isn't personal between me and you.<eos> Laura's a beautiful girl, and I expect that there are gonna be other men, so this isn't about me and you.<eos> Hey, listen, man, I get it.<eos> Long as you don't piss in my pool, Jay, we're fine.<eos> Right.<eos> You need to back off her, give her a little space, let her move on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Move on with who?<eos> You?
I'm operating.<eos> No change.<eos> I'm only here when...<eos> It pisses me off asking you.<eos> Well... I can't.<eos> I have a work meeting.<eos> - You can't change it?<eos> - No.<eos> How are you?<eos> OK.
I'm here, sweetie!<eos> They've talked about the cliff for 50 years.<eos> We know about false alarms around here.<eos> Mr Guedj, just a moment.<eos> I went to the meeting.<eos> The geological report says there's no risk.<eos> - Can I trust you?<eos> - Yes. Shall we see the cellar first?<eos> - No, the structure.<eos> - OK.
- Hello!<eos> - Hello.<eos> Your daughter?<eos> Goddaughter.<eos> Michelle.<eos> - Hello, pumpkin.<eos> - Hello. This is Virginie.<eos> - What'll it be?<eos> - Hot chocolate.<eos> And for you?
It is time to lay down the sword, Wilkin Brattle.<eos> Your savior needs you to live the life of a different man.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.<eos> I understand.<eos> The dream?<eos> You're my only dream.<eos> Will you ever tell me what you see?<eos> I see only my lovely Petra.<eos> Oh, please.
Many flee the South in search of work.<eos> That doesn't mean we don't deserve our rightful pay.<eos> If you do not find this satisfactory, move on.<eos> Find yourself another shire where you can peddle your brutal gifts.<eos> Next.<eos> Barclay the minstrel.<eos> Ah, the minstrel.<eos> We travel.<eos> But where to, Maddy?<eos> To the sea.
Thank God.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Is Cadence okay?<eos> I had no idea that she was sick.<eos> Believe me.<eos> I didn't even know that you called until tonight.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I was just on my way to fly to Nashville.<eos> You know, for months, all I wanted was for you to reach out to me.<eos> To us.

It's just marketing, though.<eos> It doesn't bother me.<eos> Does it bother you?<eos> Nah.<eos> Why would it?<eos> Great.<eos> It's settled.<eos> I'll get on it first thing.<eos> It's gonna be a big order now that we've added dates.<eos> To the tour?
I got to say,<eos> I-I'm getting a little tired of the business talk.<eos> I want to know how you actually feel.<eos> Because I like you, Gabriella, a-and I'm pretty sure that you... might just like me, as well.<eos> Look, you've been the one good thing to come out of this tour... out of any of this.<eos> Let's give this a shot.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I still think it's in both of our best interests to keep this quiet.<eos> I'm not exactly good for your brand.<eos> My brand.

Whoa, calm down, Reese Witherspoon.<eos> I'm researching the psychos who cited "Catcher in the Rye" as inspiration to see if their M.O.s match the evidence you found.<eos> You did notice a copy next to that survivalist's glass of pencils?<eos> Ryan, I think I'm on to something.<eos> She was an elementary-school teacher.<eos> Yes, but what elementary-school teacher can afford first-class tickets and five-star resorts?<eos> Doesn't line up.<eos> Like when a marine from Maryland owns a car registered in his name from California.<eos> Means nothing.<eos> On its own, maybe.
Sorry.<eos> You picked the wrong one.<eos> Our survivalist threat was still in the planning stage, apparently.<eos> We tipped him off that we were on to him, and he went underground.<eos> Everyone lost?<eos> Where's Trainee Parrish?<eos> - This is it.<eos> - All right, all right, check for exits.<eos> Weapons out.<eos> On my mark.
Over there!<eos> They're on the next building.<eos> Damn it!<eos> They didn't ask you to choose.<eos> This was all you could get.<eos> When my parents heard that I got kicked out, they were done.<eos> I was always a screw-up, but, um... now I'm the first Haas to not make agent since hoover.<eos> My sister's the only one who felt bad.<eos> Sh-She called a friend.<eos> An analyst.
Each of you had an answer, but how many of you were telling the truth?<eos> All right, guys, let's hit the track!<eos> People hide things from one another.<eos> They... they lie, they joke, they tell you what they think you want to hear.<eos> Time!<eos> Good job.<eos> Over the next 20 weeks, you will learn to see what people aren't seeing...<eos> You never wear makeup.<eos> We have to match, right?<eos> ...not just to the world but to themselves.
Should we also ask that person how you wound up unconscious at Grand Central moments after the attack?<eos> That information is classified.<eos> Nothing's classified.<eos> Look, you want me to prove my innocence?<eos> I can't.<eos> If you want to talk to them, you have to convince us first.<eos> Tell us about your missing year in India.<eos> Well, not exactly missing.<eos> Backpacking through Pakistan?<eos> Iran?
Shocking.<eos> Shocking, that's wrong.<eos> I thought you knew everything.<eos> Almost.<eos> Dare I say another round?<eos> I love this.<eos> I'll buy again.<eos> Well, with that Centurion Card, you're always buying.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Another round.
Happy New Year!<eos> So good to finally meet you.<eos> We expected you a few weeks ago.<eos> I couldn't make it, but I'm here now.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> We have the vault open so you can see the safety deposit boxes, as requested, and decide which meet your needs.<eos> Show me the four biggest you guys have.<eos> Okay.<eos> Beautiful space...<eos> So close to Grand Central.
Well, finish that up.<eos> We'll move around a bit.<eos> How's everything going?<eos> I think good, you know?<eos> I'm about to go, uh, through the interview part, and then, you know...<eos> Where's Keith?<eos> He's taking a piss.<eos> I was wondering if I might be able to take him off campus.<eos> Where?<eos> Back to my house.
Stop.<eos> Stand up.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - Stand up. Let him fight!<eos> Let him fight!<eos> Let's go.<eos> I need action. Come on.<eos> Ref!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Oh, fuck!
Family say anything to you?<eos> Daoud's bitching I spilled his wine.<eos> - Rich people.<eos> - Yeah, rich people.<eos> Hey, come on. You earned a beer.<eos> Rain check.<eos> It's Ginny. I got to go meet her.<eos> Of course.<eos> Say hi to the wife for me.<eos> Ex-wife.
Okay, they just called in my plates.<eos> So here's something cool.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> "Impossible." Good.<eos> Stay with that.<eos> I need you to wrap your head around impossible, Alex.<eos> People will die if you do not belive in the impossible in the next...<eos> Eight minutes and six seconds.<eos> Well, this is highly irregular.<eos> But within the rules.
He can't come out early! Then he'd be a Virgo and Virgos are honest and reliable.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Uh, Brad? This was an amazing tour.<eos> This is for you.<eos> For your troubles.<eos> Sir, this is a dollar. Exactly, and I need 50 cents back.<eos> Hello, Daniel.<eos> I'm excited you've finally decided to see me about your problem.<eos> Problem?
I've been talking to you for a half hour.<eos> Is there anything...<eos> Just I've got lots of work to do.<eos> Well, I have to work on myself.<eos> - Whitney.<eos> - Hi, baby.<eos> - Hey, baby.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Better now.<eos> - Oh, good, me, too.
We're gonna call it... what, what?<eos> No, see what's happening?<eos> Two minutes ago, she was like... [imitates moaning]<eos> But then... [imitates muffled shouting]<eos> Shut up! You know what, Morgan?<eos> It's actually not a problem because I've been cooped up in this apartment all day and I think it would be kinda fun to sneak out to get a drink.<eos> - What?<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> Yeah, if... if that's okay with you, master.<eos> - A drink?
I need to be friends with people I work with.<eos> I want happy hour and Secret Santas.<eos> - I could maybe be like that.<eos> you couldn't. stay and make them different.<eos> - It's not worth it.<eos> I'll just go on welfare.<eos> It's easier.<eos> now hold on.<eos> and don't ever let anyone try to stop you from doing what you want.<eos> Not even me.
Midnight Express!<eos> You have really come to our rescue.<eos> A person feels safe with you guys.<eos> You came just as I was about to head-butt the guy.<eos> - I swear...<eos> God...<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Are we ready, gentlemen?<eos> - We are.<eos> Sorry.
I'll email your assistant the details.<eos> If you could, just email it to me directly.<eos> This is too important for me to miss.<eos> Mr. Wellick, we're here.<eos> You think I could have 300 this time?<eos> Spoken like a true capitalist.<eos> Bad day at the office?<eos> No ki...<eos> Please, enough.<eos> No more.
Why does it matter if I sleep in all day?<eos> Nate.<eos> Maybe this is a chance for you to find something else you're interested in.<eos> Side to side, side to side.<eos> Good.<eos> Good, Jay, good.<eos> Get inside the pocket.<eos> Throw your hands.<eos> There you go.<eos> Double that jab.

How many guys have you been with? - Does it matter?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I don't know... Three maybe.<eos> Well, were they random guys or people you knew, or what?<eos> I don't even remember their fucking names.<eos> So, it just turns you on and gets you off or whatever.<eos> Sometimes, yeah.<eos> I told a friend.<eos> What?<eos> Who?
Yeah.<eos> Good. I wanna meet her.<eos> I got a recommendation for a doctor up in San Francisco.<eos> San Francisco?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did your father put you up to that?<eos> No.<eos> You just told me you liked your doctor.<eos> Why the fuck would you go to San Francisco?<eos> Because of this.
Well, can't you just give me a break?<eos> No, I can't. Get your ex-husband to co-sign for you.<eos> He won't.<eos> Well, I... I don't know what you want me to say.<eos> It's not gonna work out.<eos> This place will be gone by tomorrow.<eos> Thanks for... dropping by.<eos> You're disgusting.<eos> You're a pig, and I feel sorry for your wife.<eos> Hey, me, too.
Marco, I could have tapped out in that first round as fast as you ended the second, so I just wanna say thank you.<eos> I wanna thank Lisa Prince.<eos> Beautiful woman.<eos> A pit bull of a manager.<eos> - Yeah. And a giver of life.<eos> Alvey Kulina and all my boys at Navy Street.<eos> What? ! What?<eos> This is why we grind it out every day, gentlemen! For right here!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Navy Street! To my brother...
Most urgently, she said.<eos> She waits in her bed chamber.<eos> She was quite upset, crying.<eos> Why?<eos> What happened?<eos> We only know of her needs, sir.<eos> Should we tell her you refuse?<eos> Oh, I am certain that you are quite lost.<eos> I was told the baroness needed to see me.<eos> An urgent matter.
Father, is all well?<eos> Yes.<eos> Will you put me to bed?<eos> What did I...?<eos> Not yet.<eos> When I was nine... perhaps ten... this cleric that ran the foundling's home--<eos> Darbone-- he would teach us piety and patience with a hot iron.<eos> It was very cruel. Very effective.<eos> Please...<eos> At night...
Perhaps it would be best if you were to tell him, my lady.<eos> Your grace and calm manner bring much comfort to our punisher.<eos> He seems a different man when he is near you. Yes.<eos> I would like to be the one to tell Master Gawain.<eos> Good night, my lady. Good night, Chamberlain.<eos> Chamberlain.<eos> I spoke to our chamberlain.<eos> Yea, our mission found its proper course.<eos> Sir Gaveston will no longer plague our shire.<eos> Or any shire.
No, it's not.<eos> _<eos> - Ice-cold beer.<eos> - Oh. Truffle fries.<eos> Steak, medium-rare, and another ice-cold beer.<eos> Mm-hmm. Wine.<eos> Oh, I'd kill for a glass of wine.<eos> What do you miss that's not food?<eos> Well, the sun, without a doubt.<eos> You?
11 o'clock sharp.<eos> Don't be late.<eos> Frank.<eos> Mr. Crothers?<eos> Hi. Ed McCarthy.<eos> We've met a couple of times.<eos> I'm an old buddy of Frank's.<eos> I'm real sorry, sir. Real sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too.
My teeth feel funny.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Well?<eos> They look fine.<eos> Now, as you all know, next week is our competition night, but remember, it's a celebration of all your hard work and not a competition.<eos> Then, maybe change the name?<eos> Has anybody seen Violet?<eos> Oh, sorry!<eos> So sorry I'm late!<eos> So, so sorry!
Wait, no.<eos> Can you give us a second?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll see you later, all right?<eos> I'll see ya, Mingo.<eos> What was that about?<eos> He and Vimla just had a fight.<eos> Oh.<eos> He told me he has feelings for somebody else.<eos> Who?

Oh, and this place is the Taj Mahal?<eos> It's suit and tie, they have a great wine list...<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't we go check it out together?<eos> You want me to go to a strip club?<eos> Why not?<eos> If it's as bad as you think it is, we're done.<eos> If it's not, will you at least consider it with an open mind?<eos> I'll try.<eos> - Hey there.
You seriously think I would do that to my own son?<eos> If you had a good reason.<eos> If he betrayed you, maybe.<eos> Betrayed me?<eos> Betrayed me?<eos> What kind of shit have you been putting into my daughter's head?<eos> Don, be careful, it's not worth it.<eos> I thought it had something to do with what Grier told you but you knew about the deal he made with Mike and you decided he had to be taught a lesson, didn't you?<eos> Didn't you?<eos> What deal?

- Not long.<eos> And you already have a summer job?<eos> Good for you.<eos> Money's not bad and the people are nice, so...<eos> So tell me everything.<eos> How was field hockey?<eos> I heard that you guys kicked Indiana's ass.<eos> - Yeah, it was a big win for us.<eos> - Were you a starter?<eos> Actually, I, um...
And it might take me longer than other people.<eos> But I will get there.<eos> I am going to do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> So...<eos> Lily will pick a card.<eos> And then whoever wrote it can read it out loud<eos> - to the rest of the group.<eos> - Bay, if you don't mind?<eos> Hi, everyone.
Uh, so I think that I know a little bit about the, uh, mother-child relationship.<eos> And for me, the most important thing a mother can do<eos> is be honest with her children.<eos> Because in the end, kids will always figure out the truth.<eos> Um...<eos> I spoke to Daphne.<eos> What else is new?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should've told you about Hope.<eos> And Atlanta.
What we do and what they do, it's different.<eos> So we don't have the same restrictions, so we don't have the same protections.<eos> Well, I have a plan.<eos> Um, involves another confession.<eos> My reasons for investigating the disappearance of Alicia Garcia-Bloom were not entirely selfless.<eos> The mystery of her disappearance has been one of the greatest of the last 20 years, or so the popular media would have us believe.<eos> Jonathan Bloom's face has been on the cover of every magazine, he's been the subject of books, documentaries...<eos> Uh, if you think solving this case is gonna get us back into the department's good graces...<eos> Not us, Watson.<eos> You.
All our body-cams are up and running...<eos> - Now. - Good.<eos> Thank you, Buzz.<eos> - Lieutenant Provenza, are you ready to move?<eos> - Yes, Captain. Okay, Sykes, there's only one door up here. I've got it covered.<eos> I need to risk calling Sara. Think she still has access to her cellphone?<eos> I'm about to find out.<eos> I'd probably set up a second banquet table inside the entryway.<eos> And do you really think you can make this all happen<eos> - for New Year's?
Well, no, not Mr. Tagomi personally, but one of the girls said<eos> I should ask since I was down here.<eos> I think it's kind of urgent.<eos> Uh, the person I'm looking for is Iwazaru...<eos> Sakura Iwazaru.<eos> You're sure about that?<eos> Why?<eos> What school did you go to?<eos> You don't know the Three Monkeys proverb?<eos> Mizaru:
Sakura Iwazaru.<eos> You're sure about that?<eos> Why?<eos> What school did you go to?<eos> You don't know the Three Monkeys proverb?<eos> Mizaru:<eos> See no evil.<eos> Kikazaru:<eos> Hear no evil.<eos> Iwazaru:
It belongs to Guy LaFontaine.<eos> Who the hell is Guy LaFontaine?<eos> I sold a novel inspired by the kidnapping, and because the FBI frowns on that kind of thing,<eos> I created Guy LaFontaine as my nom de plume, a pen name. The 100 grand is LaFontaine's advance. I just haven't had time to create an account for him.<eos> Shea's not only a crook, he's crazy.<eos> But crazy full of himself or crazy like a fox?<eos> Your book on Kevin Clark doesn't have an ending.<eos> Oh, I'm about to write it.<eos> That bullet helps me get to the end.<eos> Us, too.
It's an ongoing interview with your nephew, Your Honor.<eos> You claim that Henry had nothing to do with Chandler's death.<eos> What about you?<eos> Is there something that you're not telling us?<eos> No.<eos> No, I-I don't know anything.<eos> You suspect Sean of murdering Chandler?<eos> Just watch.<eos> Okay, Sean, let me ask you another question.<eos> Maybe off-topic.
I just don't wear bloody heels.<eos> I even had a pine for the {*} days where we didn't have to fight bloody aliens.<eos> It's just not a fair fight.<eos> Let's see if we can level the playing field.<eos> Really?<eos> Your batons?<eos> That's your game-changer?<eos> Well, all right, then.<eos> - Let me make a call to my people.<eos> - Your people?
Hooroo, Ted.<eos> We'll see ya.<eos> See ya, Roy.<eos> He's a good bloke, Ted.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where's that bloody dog gone?<eos> Thank you for this, Roy.<eos> Given the circumstances, I didn't think it appropriate to call on the farmers in my vehicle.<eos> Mr Bligh, your vehicle would have bust her hump up that first hill.<eos> Here!
You're a girl about town.<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> Sexy young bohemians doing sexy young things.<eos> But we discussed that I was to do art pieces.<eos> This is a bloody art piece!<eos> I want to know what happens in the bars and the alleyways after the exhibitions, not boring waffle about the damn paintings.<eos> And give me the dirt on those boozy openings of yours, without getting me sued, of course.<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> Our arrangement is terminated... which will make a certain member of your family very happy.<eos> Regina.
I think it's best, if from now on we slept in separate bedrooms.<eos> And if I were to tell you, that's NOT what I want?<eos> I'll be coming and going so often.<eos> Between running Ash Park and trips to the city, I will only disturb you.<eos> This way, you'll get your rest.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Carlo.<eos> I'm sorry Carlo, Gino is not here.<eos> Oh, ehm, is it true, the vines are dead?<eos> Yes, unfortunately.
I didn't do anything, you haven't done before.<eos> I will go to the police.<eos> The press too, if I have to.<eos> Who will believe you ?<eos> Who will take your word, against mine?<eos> They'll call you a tramp.<eos> Drag your name through the mud.<eos> Ruin your brother's career into the bargain, hmm?<eos> Why don't you go back to Inverness?<eos> Back to your country doctor.
I saved us that night in the woods when the militia stopped our carriage.<eos> They would have raped me and killed you, killed both of us, but I stopped them.<eos> Surely that was not an evil act.<eos> A man died that night.<eos> I thought it divine judgment.<eos> It was not God's judgment but mine.<eos> Then it was murder.<eos> It was him or us.<eos> Cotton, where are you going?<eos> - To the magistrate.
We're gonna have to split up into groups and keep moving.<eos> 10K, are you all right?<eos> What? ! I think he's deaf.<eos> Doc. You take him with you.<eos> You guys, get to the alley and cut east and advance north.<eos> Mack and Addy, you guys take the westside.<eos> We'll flush him out.<eos> Well... well what about the bounty hunters?<eos> Kill them too!<eos> On my call.
Sorry for your loss.<eos> We're going after my car.<eos> We need to go back for the others.<eos> Our water supply is in that car.<eos> You put all of your water in one car?<eos> That man ain't right.<eos> But I don't want to be on foot with those things out there.<eos> So we borrow a car.<eos> My bounty's back there.<eos> Your bounty?
Come on!<eos> Okay, call Dad and say that we'll be a bit late.<eos> I'm sorry, honey.<eos> I remember that your friend was here...<eos> Partner.<eos> We don't disclose information about our guests.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Every time we're in Stockholm we stay here.<eos> -Don't you not know me at all?<eos> -Unfortunately.
Why check out in the middle of the night?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sorry.<eos> The massage room is there on the right.<eos> I will be there in a minute.<eos> Yes, you wanted to know if your girlfriend had been here?<eos> -Partner.<eos> -Has she left you?<eos> No, I'm wondering if she was here at some point?<eos> No, unfortunately.
I think she's missing.<eos> Have you asked yourself why?<eos> Is she here?<eos> Is she there?<eos> Damn...<eos> - Isabella?<eos> I want to share with you my feeling of Christmas, which is magical.<eos> It smells good, it is beautiful, mysterious...<eos> -Can you please go?<eos> -Sorry.
In your book you write about murders on famous women.<eos> We need your expertise.<eos> On 25 December at. 10.21 Stockholm Police found the 39-year-old TV chef Isabella Levin dead<eos> -in the basement of the Hotel Gloria.<eos> An autopsy showed that she had been struck in the face and smothered to death.<eos> Police investigations suggest that she had lain dead in the basement for three days after the brutal murder.<eos> Levin was Swedish Television's popular chef<eos> -and advocated a healthy organic kitchen.<eos> She leaves behind two small children.<eos> Now to other news...
Sit.<eos> The girls were thrilled to have Noah?<eos> Yes, come and sit here.<eos> - I love you, Marcus.<eos> - Yes....<eos> - Nicolas Rosén...<eos> - What is it ?<eos> Nicolas was my brother.<eos> My half brother..<eos> The son of my father.
Well, just think the opposite of that.<eos> But my wedding was lovely.<eos> It was just everything that followed that was so unpleasant.<eos> Wasn't my wedding lovely, Freddie?<eos> It was shit.<eos> But I looked fabulous, didn't I?<eos> Maybe don't ask any more questions, dear.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh hello, Ash, how are you feeling?<eos> Not so great.
I thought... ..Not-Leonard was coming tonight.<eos> He just texted me.<eos> He'll be here in a minute.<eos> Isn't it wonderful?<eos> Isn't what wonderful?<eos> He's got a mobile phone.<eos> Between that and a computer, I think I've really hit the jackpot this time.<eos> Well, here's to us.<eos> Here's to us, darling.<eos> One more? Sure.
Hey, honey.<eos> Hello?<eos> Sammy?<eos> Hi.<eos> I need to tell you something.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm-I'm fine.<eos> Um, but I'm not coming back.<eos> Not-not right now.
You know there was a memorial service, right?<eos> Never occurred to me you weren't actually dead.<eos> Sammy, I couldn't tell you the truth.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> I'm a man sentenced to death for treason.<eos> They would never let us be together.<eos> All I'd have ever been to you was a... a voice hiding out on the end of the phone.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe I would've liked to hear your voice one more time.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
Well, I went to see a learned man about why God is punishing me.<eos> Wait, you think that God is punishing you?<eos> Well... it feels like it.<eos> Maybe... maybe because I couldn't forgive my brother.<eos> And no... no war can be won without the help of God.<eos> Mr. President, as wise as you are, you cannot presume to know what God is thinking.<eos> Well, it's not me presuming.<eos> The sheik told me there is a poison inside the Palace.<eos> It could be anyone.<eos> But you...
My big brother.<eos> Well, it was very nice.<eos> It was touching.<eos> I'm going to count to three, then I'm going to shoot your brother's nose off.<eos> If you still don't get up, walk over to that map, I'm going to blow his ears off.<eos> And if, and if you still do not move,<eos> I'm going to shoot out his eyes.<eos> One.<eos> Two.<eos> Me too, please.
Been a while since I took a shot from that far out.<eos> - Felt good.<eos> - Yeah, I bet.<eos> Guess in all that excitement, you forgot about the part where we need Phil Coulson alive.<eos> - He made it out.<eos> - By the skin of his teeth.<eos> What the hell were you thinking about, sending in your little bones brigade?<eos> I wanted to put Coulson through his paces. Ah.<eos> This is not some game you just leave to chance.<eos> Well, maybe not for you.
She only turned her back for a moment.<eos> Stellar parenting.<eos> I've done the same thing, Captain.<eos> Don't blame the mom.<eos> So, what exactly happened when her back was turned?<eos> Perp jumped out of the yellow cab and grabbed Theo.<eos> The mom didn't get the medallion number or the tag.<eos> No doubt stolen, like the cab from the park, so that's a dead end.<eos> Post a man on the door and take a hard look at the dad.<eos> Carl Davis?
Seen Violet?<eos> When? What are you talking about?<eos> Why do you behave so oddly every time I mention Violet?<eos> I don't behave oddly!<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Then you try to confuse me by changing the subject.<eos> No, I don't!<eos> And you totally look 50, by the way.<eos> I was saying to friends, 'I hope, when I'm Stuart's age, I look that amazing.'<eos> Really? What friends?
This is a snark hunt, and the only reason Malick sent you is because you're expendable.<eos> Sir, over here!<eos> Move.<eos> Move!<eos> Is that...<eos> Hail Hydra.<eos> One of you want to tell me what Coulson was thinking jumping out of the Quinjet like that?<eos> I would say he wasn't so much thinking as feeling ... - feeling that Ward needs to die.<eos> - And you didn't try to stop him.<eos> Full disclosure ...
I did try to make it exciting.<eos> All those scary bits.<eos> All those death-defying scrapes, monsters, and a proper climax with a really big one at the end!<eos> Compulsive viewing.<eos> I did tell you not to watch.<eos> There's nothing left of Rassmussen any more.<eos> Only us.<eos> Only us.<eos> You will show this film to your family, won't you?<eos> And your friends.

Ohh.<eos> - [Door closes] - Mellie:<eos> Oh, look, it's the girl who can't shut her legs... or her mouth.<eos> We've got one hour to give Noah Baker an exclusive interview with the president and first lady, or he runs the footage of you lying about the affair.<eos> What do you expect us to say exactly?<eos> The truth.<eos> The truth?<eos> Yes, Mellie.<eos> We have no other choice.<eos> Thanks to her.
All the hideously long days and nights you're about to spend hosting ridiculous galas and balls, standing by his side, your teeth smeared with Vaseline so your smile stays wide and bright like you're some kind of wax figure.<eos> Ah! Yes!<eos> [Sighing]<eos> Trust me, this stuff is the only thing that gets you through... the lady lunching and the curating, the tedious cause you have to come up with and then pretend to care about.<eos> Do you like to decorate, Olivia?<eos> Come wintertime, do you find little snowflake ornaments and golden pinecones just adorable?<eos> I hope you do because those 111 Christmas trees don't just design themselves.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> [Breathing heavily]<eos> What the hell?
- ♪ You're all I need to get by ♪ - [Indistinct conversations]<eos> Abby's going to stand at the podium, and she's going to throw me under the bus.<eos> - The hell she is. - ♪ You're all ♪<eos> No, don't.<eos> It's door number two.<eos> They need a villain, and it can't be you.<eos> - ♪ I need to get by ♪ - It's the right play.<eos> She knows what she's doing.<eos> She's handling this exactly the way I would.<eos> Hello, everyone.
I don't have time to go grocery shopping.<eos> Of course not. You're too busy getting your freak on with the pres.<eos> That's the country talking, not me.<eos> America's starting to see you as an everywoman, but to seal the deal, they need to be told by someone, someone they respect, that you are, in fact, human and not some man-eating, husband-stealing hunk of artificial intelligence, and not by one of these mongrels or any of the other dirty deviants you represent, myself included.<eos> I'm talking about someone with gravitas.<eos> Someone respected, admired, beloved.<eos> Someone who actually knows you.<eos> - No.<eos> - He's perfect.<eos> National profile.
What if I come in on the left side, right?<eos> Just down here.<eos> You see this right here?<eos> I'm gonna miss you, Scott.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.<eos> Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals.<eos> All right, break it up.<eos> Break it up!<eos> Break it up!<eos> Scotty!
Get me to the roof.<eos> And radio ahead.<eos> I want to make sure the helicopter is ready to take off.<eos> You two, kill anything that comes out of that vault!<eos> Dad, can you move?<eos> We need to get him out of here.<eos> Go get that suit.<eos> Hey, Scotty.<eos> Hey, did I save your life?<eos> Scotty?

And then I want you to imagine how he'd react at trial, under cross-examination from Andrea Hobbs.<eos> I'm offering Slider an opportunity to practice some... Some ordinary social interaction before you put him in front of a jury.<eos> If I were you, I'd want to see how he behaves.<eos> Julio found Miss Mitzy at her house.<eos> He's on his way up with her right now.<eos> And still no sign of the brother.<eos> Does Mitzy have a criminal record?<eos> No. Just a social one. She says on Facebook she left her job as a dental hygienist three months ago to start her own publicity firm.<eos> So, Chip's sister is also his publicist?<eos> Apparently.
Meaning we've been told to limit the time of the visit to one hour.<eos> No more.<eos> One hour will be tight.<eos> These things drag on-- Introductions, handshakes, speeches, e...<eos> Okay.<eos> One hour.<eos> It's probably a wedding.<eos> Of course.<eos> A wedding.<eos> But you, you...
Brother-in-law, you're here. What happened?<eos> How? I don't know either.<eos> I'm not sure what's going on.<eos> They say it's an accident caused by speeding.<eos> I just don't understand it, even the location he was found in.<eos> Just before...<eos> It's regarding Eun Hee's accident.<eos> Do not tell Officer Choi that we're meeting.<eos> Don't ever tell him.<eos> Nothing...
The boy hid, praying for mercy.<eos> But none came, only an Angel of Death.<eos> And she slipped through the flames, relishing in the horror she wrought.<eos> But before she escaped, she saw the boy.<eos> And amidst the carnage, do you know what she did?<eos> She smiled at him.<eos> And you were the evil queen.<eos> Who else knows?<eos> Who have you told?<eos> No one.
I know how much getting that dagger means to you, so you can prove yourself to Merlin.<eos> Yes, my Queen.<eos> But until then, I don't see why you can't live in the kingdom you deserve.<eos> And I think it's time to fix this broken kingdom, don't you?<eos> Give me the dagger, or I will put this sword through my oldest friend, like I should have done years ago.<eos> No.<eos> First you try and steal my wife, and now you want to deny me the dagger<eos> - after all I've done for you!<eos> - Please don't hurt him!<eos> Here.
This helmet and our friends do not.<eos> Throw this on any stranger you see, and bring me what's left of them.<eos> It will be nothing but teeth and bones.<eos> This is war now.<eos> When I was seeing Rumplestiltskin in my head, he said he would only be with me until I embraced my dark powers.<eos> So recently, I've been thinking maybe not seeing him, maybe that's a bad thing.<eos> Have you embraced your powers?<eos> I've done some dark things recently.<eos> I hurt someone...<eos> My son.
I don't think we're safe here anymore.<eos> Granny, let's close up shop.<eos> One step ahead of you.<eos> Henry, lock the front.<eos> I got the back.<eos> Henry?<eos> He'll be fine once we're done.<eos> I'm sorry for the theatrics.<eos> It's not usually my style, but... I had to follow orders.<eos> Orders?
Fine sailor.<eos> I caught him drinking the captain's wine.<eos> I drowned him.<eos> Every ring is a sad story.<eos> What about this one?<eos> I thought I lost it in Camelot.<eos> You gave it to me to keep safe.<eos> It's the saddest story of all.<eos> Belonged to a better man than I...<eos> My brother Liam.
We really need another doctor in this town.<eos> And what's with the dye job?<eos> Oh, so... so Emma changes her hair and no one makes a fuss, but I get ridiculed? Yeah?<eos> Come on.<eos> You know you like it.<eos> Oh, my God, stop talking!<eos> Didn't I kill you the last time I was here?<eos> No, you just threw me across the room.<eos> I hope that doesn't happen again this time.<eos> Okay, all business today.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to find some other way to do that.<eos> And who will even notice?<eos> These people are practically animals already.<eos> Even if we wanted to give it to you, we can't.<eos> We don't have it.<eos> Perhaps you don't, but we will.<eos> That belonged to my father!<eos> I know.<eos> And with a simple locator spell, it'll lead us to another one of his possessions...<eos> - The helm.
But... maybe I can help.<eos> Come with me.<eos> It might do you some good.<eos> Searching for werewolves?<eos> It's better than wallowing in self-pity.<eos> I don't wallow.<eos> Look, maybe helping someone else find their path will help you with yours.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, good luck.<eos> To both of you.
Why would you tell Jenna that you kissed me?<eos> You know why we broke up, right?<eos> I finally told her that the reason I'm having a hard time falling in love with her is because I've already... fallen in love with somebody else.<eos> - With you.<eos> - Yeah, I-I got that.<eos> Hey, I know it's not okay. I know.<eos> You don't...<eos> I know you don't feel the same way about me.<eos> And I promise I would never, ever want to break up a marriage.<eos> I just, uh...
Oh, my love.<eos> What an impossible task you've given yourself.<eos> It's all right.<eos> We've forgiven him.<eos> You can too.<eos> I promise, it's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Dad...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Me too.
Actually, you owe Rachel one.<eos> No shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> (both as Clay Davis from The Wire) Shiiit.<eos> By the way, you're in the wrong conference room.<eos> Okay, Esther, what are you doing here?<eos> What, a woman can't stop by to see her brother, who she loves?<eos> Please, you know damn well we don't love each other.<eos> In that case, I need a lawyer.<eos> [laughs] You?
No, Robert, they did that by not telling you what they did.<eos> Which means the client you lost was breaking the law.<eos> And worse than that, they were lying to their lawyer.<eos> So you think this is funny?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I think your future son-in-law trusted you had nothing to do with it and then saved your ass from committing a crime.<eos> You're...welcome?<eos> Thank you.<eos> And you have my condolences.<eos> - For what?
Supposedly it's pretty common among ex-addicts.<eos> Told me I had till the end of the year if I'm lucky.<eos> Is... is that why you came back?<eos> I just want my daughter to know me... this me.<eos> I'm really glad you decided to come.<eos> I thought S.T.A.R. Labs had to shut down.<eos> It's under new management.<eos> What kind of treadmill is that?<eos> Cosmic.<eos> Cool.
Yeah, well, you and Abbie may have been his protégés, but I inherited some of my dad's - cop instincts. - Hmm.<eos> Like, I can tell when you're holding back.<eos> Come on, what are you mixed up in?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Really.<eos> I've been keeping it super low-key lately.<eos> What is it with you and your sister anyway?<eos> Look, you know, just 'cause my dad kept me on the outside of his investigation into the strange and stranger, doesn't mean you have to.<eos> Corbin led Abbie and I down a path 'cause we were already on it.<eos> - And not by choice.
It wasn't, and they kicked her out. Now she's in jail. The end.<eos> Mm. So I have even less dignity in that story. So that's the one we'll accept as true.<eos> "from a hairier part of your body and surgically implant them on your lip." I'm not doing that. But you're the perfect candidate.<eos> Back-stache, belly-stache. Hello?<eos> Butt-stache! Can we just...?<eos> Let Tina have the floor finally? Yes, because I know that even if there's no mustache that night, Mom and Dad would still fall in love because of fate, which is great!<eos> Remember?<eos> ! This is how you throw a shrimp! Ow!<eos> Done. They're in love. Everyone got that?<eos> Everyone clear?
I can teach her karate.<eos> I mean the girl's got kick on her.<eos> You totally felt that, right?<eos> And she isn't that bad with a punch either.<eos> Plus there's all these awesome weapons she could learn about<eos> She could have a bo staff or a sword.<eos> She'd be amazing.<eos> Okay, so they did shoot at us.<eos> But hey, they left us this nifty ride and a half eaten hamburger that hasn't degraded in four years.<eos> Oh, me, me, me, me.
Our team, we got to get to California.<eos> And our man Murphy, he's immune.<eos> There's a lab.<eos> To make a vaccine.<eos> Medicine. Medicine that will help a lot of people.<eos> Save a lot of people.<eos> We believe that peace is will of God.<eos> We follow the way of peace, justice, unity.<eos> We practice not to resist.<eos> Even through violence.
Yes, I think you might be right.<eos> Crane.<eos> Crane.<eos> It's over.<eos> How now?<eos> Yes.<eos> The dentist.<eos> Uh, when he arrives, fetch my timber plank to put it in my teeth to bite for the pain.<eos> It's over there.<eos> By my codicil!
You trying to solve some off-book, uh, - investigation or something?<eos> - What if it were?<eos> You're one of Corbin's protégés.<eos> I'd still have your back.<eos> First day on the beat, Corbin told me that most of the real work you do is outside the job.<eos> That worked for local PD, but the Bureau...<eos> That's-that's a whole new level.<eos> I've dreamt about this for years. I don't want - to mess up my shot.<eos> - So why don't you trust<eos> August Corbin?
Which is why we got in and got out.<eos> No harm, no foul.<eos> "No harm."<eos> You could've compromised everything that we've...<eos> - If I may. - Mm.<eos> What was inside the case after Nevins opened it?<eos> It was a glowing crystal.<eos> And when I took it from him, it disintegrated.<eos> Did you touch the crystal?<eos> No, just the outer casing.
Copy that.<eos> Security teams, lock down the facility.<eos> No one gets in or out.<eos> All agents report to your posts.<eos> - We are on high alert.<eos> - Stay put.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> High alert status.<eos> Agents report to your posts.<eos> All agents.
Find whatever it is out there that's pulling on you.<eos> And when you find it, Berk will be right here waiting for you.<eos> You best get out of here before all this nostalgia wears off and he changes his mind.<eos> You take care of my boy, dragon.<eos> - You ready for this?<eos> - Blah, blah, blah.<eos> Why do you have to make a production out of everything?<eos> Let's just go already.<eos> Okay, but if anyone has any reservations...<eos> Into the great beyond!
- Blah, blah, blah.<eos> Why do you have to make a production out of everything?<eos> Let's just go already.<eos> Okay, but if anyone has any reservations...<eos> Into the great beyond!<eos> Yeah, great beyond!<eos> Okay, no reservations.<eos> Let's go, bud!<eos> Whoo!<eos> Into the great beyond.

- Great beyond.<eos> - Yeah, great beyond.<eos> Great beyond.<eos> Oh, come on, you guys.<eos> So we've had a couple of tough hours.<eos> Nothing that's worth anything comes easy.<eos> Is that one of your riddles?<eos> Because now is not the time, my friend.<eos> We have to keep saying "great beyond".<eos> - Great beyond.
- Yeah, great beyond.<eos> Great beyond.<eos> Oh, come on, you guys.<eos> So we've had a couple of tough hours.<eos> Nothing that's worth anything comes easy.<eos> Is that one of your riddles?<eos> Because now is not the time, my friend.<eos> We have to keep saying "great beyond".<eos> - Great beyond.<eos> - Great beyond.
All right, Snotlout, you're the man of the hour for bringing the Monstrous Nightmare gel.<eos> You choose.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yeah, seriously.<eos> All right!<eos> What do you say, Fangster?<eos> Ha!<eos> Couldn't agree more.<eos> Into the great beyond!<eos> The great beyond!
Fishlegs!<eos> Uhh!<eos> I knew I hated this mission.<eos> Plasma blast, bud.<eos> Oh, I see how it is.<eos> You're allowed to blast it.<eos> You and your Snot-rockets almost got me killed!<eos> Calm down, Snotlout, you lived.<eos> Yay us.<eos> No thanks to Itch-legs over here.
It's gonna be close!<eos> Yeah, no way he's making that.<eos> - What?<eos> - Good job, Toothless.<eos> Woo-hoo!<eos> Ooh!<eos> - All right, we're up.<eos> - Come on, Snotlout.<eos> Nobody's been able to beat the dome except Hiccup.<eos> - Nobody till now.
The two are bound together.<eos> Edward is your heir.<eos> If he lives, I would say it's a sign.<eos> Wessex will live.<eos> There is barely a heartbeat.<eos> Let me give the child to Iseult.<eos> Oh, may God have mercy on each of us.<eos> Where is he taking him?<eos> Am I allowed to know?<eos> To Iseult.
I had my mom pack me a lunch.<eos> Ew, apple slices?<eos> I'll eat you last.<eos> Just make with the rules, ugly.<eos> The game is a battle royale.<eos> We help our characters by casting spells determined by rolls of the dice.<eos> If you win, I go back to my own dimension.<eos> But if I win, I eat their brains.<eos> Hey, I'm not sure this is such a good...<eos> - Deal!
It's also the same as doing nothing.<eos> If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there's not a lot anyone can do to stop him.<eos> That's why he does it for a living. Now excuse me.<eos> It's time to thrash your "Roy" score.<eos> You know, you could stop this killing from happening, Rick!<eos> You know, you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted.<eos> Uh-huh, yeah, that's the difference between you and me, Morty. - I never go back to the carpet store.<eos> - Holy shit! This guy's taking Roy off the grid! This guy doesn't have a social security number for Roy!<eos> Hi. I'm sorry. I think there was a misunderstanding.<eos> Well, of course. Right through that tube.
There isn't time!<eos> Just run!<eos> Get out here and help me!<eos> They say you shouldn't do that!<eos> Sorry, Jerry.<eos> You're real.<eos> I'm a parasite!<eos> Yeah, but you're real.<eos> Uh, uh, I need time to forget about Sleepy Gary.<eos> Me, too.
Pretty freaky. Hi.<eos> I'm Morty's math teacher.<eos> I'm also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together.<eos> How is praying going to help?<eos> Ma'am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather.<eos> Did you want to play checkers?<eos> Let's be rational!<eos> I'll see you at God's house!<eos> Gentlemen, gentlemen!<eos> One at a time!
Slurping, slurping, slurping it up.<eos> Wh-wh-why are you making that face?<eos> Holy [bleep]!<eos> It's me.<eos> I've convinced the people of this planet that I'm a traveler from another world.<eos> You don't think that's overdoing it a little?<eos> I mean, you could achieve the same effect with a pair of-- Never mind.<eos> You know what? I shouldn't be so critical.<eos> I'm an alien.<eos> Places, please.
I take no part in the festival.<eos> If you desire to kill me, I only ask you do it quickly.<eos> No such agenda, chief.<eos> We're not too keen on the purge, either, sir.<eos> We were just hoping to get on the roof of your lighthouse so we can send a beacon to my sister on Earth.<eos> - It's a different planet.<eos> - By the way, life on other planets exists. Don't let it distract you.<eos> I'll let you use my lighthouse for shelter and beacon-sending on the condition that you listen to my tale.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Deal.
But you know what I am gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna find someone to run against you.<eos> You just lost your greatest asset and made your worst enemy.<eos> When does this partner meeting start, huh?<eos> - My back is killing me.<eos> - It's these chairs.<eos> We need better lumbar support.<eos> God, my butt.<eos> It's like sitting at a ball game.<eos> Hey, a little quiet, please, huh?
You can't come in now and pretend that you have a voice.<eos> This is my choice.<eos> It's a hard choice.<eos> It's the hardest choice I've ever had to make, but it's mine.<eos> And I don't need you coming in now and scolding me.<eos> My gosh, it's good to see you two smiling and laughing.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, if your husband does run, why should voters vote for him?<eos> Well, um, loyalty.<eos> He's loyal to his family.<eos> His friends.
- Should we get started?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> Hey, look, um...<eos> I really want this internship, but I don't want things to be weird.<eos> - Why would they be weird?<eos> - You know...<eos> Everything that happened with us?<eos> It's all behind us.<eos> I promise I'll treat you like anybody else.<eos> - Completely professional.
- How's Flora?<eos> - She breathes.<eos> Nothing else.<eos> A family of murderers that call themselves the Bishops.<eos> They killed to sell to the surgery school, sir.<eos> We now have a potential scandal on our hands which threatens to do exactly what that monstrous object you found was designed to bring about.<eos> God help us when the newspapers get hold of this!<eos> "Why, on the eve of the Anatomy Act, "has the disclosure of this monstrous artefact been suppressed<eos> "denying Londoners the knowledge of a diabolical surgeon in their midst "acting in apparent imitation of Mary Shelley's infamous mad man,<eos> "Victor Frankenstein?"
- Why would he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He said I'd be better off with you.<eos> Ask him yourself if you don't believe me.<eos> - And chose your word over his?<eos> - I begged him to let me stay.<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> He made his servant bring me back.<eos> I bled all the way, I could barely stand.<eos> - Lloris?
What further humiliation do you require?<eos> I fear Daniel may be steeped in blood in ways you can't even begin to imagine.<eos> Just leave now.<eos> Hear me out.<eos> He's an abortionist.<eos> Flora's child was killed, not miscarried, by his hand.<eos> No.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> This marriage you are embarked upon, not only will it put an end to your hopes of happiness it will fund evils such as this and others I dare not name.<eos> What manner of evil?
Please tell me you know what's going on.<eos> Who am I?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> All these tests and you don't know anything?<eos> We know that you're telling us the truth.<eos> We're certain of that now.<eos> - Of course I am, why would I...<eos> - Ma'am...<eos> There is no match to your prints.<eos> Or your DNA.
Here's the thing, Jack.<eos> When you took on Harvey, You pitted the grinders against the rainmakers, And that was a good move,<eos> But you want to move to the next level? We need to be both grinders and rainmakers.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that we need to revisit The compensation agreement.<eos> No way.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because when we get this business, It will be worth a fortune to us.<eos> - "us"?
That's not my problem.<eos> So you don't believe in second chances?<eos> I didn't say that. No, you just said a man you didn't trust swore he changed.<eos> And instead of giving him a chance to prove that, You launched an all-out war.<eos> Were you listening to my goddamn story?<eos> Did you hear what he said? That is not a man that's changed.<eos> No, I'm talking about what you did.<eos> You launched an all-out war.<eos> I did that for my client. And for your information, I've given plenty of people second chances.<eos> - Like who?
I...<eos> Feel like going mudding tonight?<eos> - No. - I figured.<eos> You better be here to tell me Tanner's walking away.<eos> I'm here to tell you that I met with him today.<eos> You went to see him without telling me?<eos> - I left you two messages.<eos> - So the hell what?<eos> You don't cut me out of a meeting on my case.<eos> Your case?
A coffin?<eos> I want you to bring my sister back to life.<eos> No.<eos> You took her life away from her.<eos> It is your obligation to bring her back.<eos> I have no obligations in this house.<eos> You don't get to waltz in here and demand a cup of tea, let alone this.<eos> Thea wasn't dead.<eos> Sara is.<eos> Thanks to you.
Rachmaninoff.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> I did download the documents.<eos> I did pass them to Otto Düring.<eos> Saul.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> I'm loyal, too, I guess.<eos> Loyal to who?
- I'm getting my MBA.<eos> - That's great, Esam.<eos> You got me out of Iraq, Carrie, gave me a second chance.<eos> I'm gonna make the most of it.<eos> Well, looks like you're doing just that.<eos> So you want my report now or later?<eos> - Now is good.<eos> - It was too easy.<eos> Third call I made was to the Iraqi Refugee<eos> Assistance Project.
It's definitely him.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Alarm system?<eos> Not that I could see.<eos> What now?<eos> Now we wait for him to go out.<eos> Why not just go put a gun to his face?<eos> He's got no incentive to talk to me.<eos> Not yet, anyway.
Okay.<eos> Can we meet somewhere?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm just leaving Amsterdam now.<eos> I'll call you when I'm closer to home.<eos> I'll be waiting.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Of course.<eos> And, Allison, please don't tell anyone about this.<eos> Anyone.
I need to see you.<eos> Yeah, you said.<eos> When can you come in?<eos> Not at your office.<eos> There's a... there's a village east of Hamburg- - Reinbek.<eos> I've left instructions for you there.<eos> Baghdad protocol.<eos> That's a five-hour drive.<eos> Can't you give me a little bit more to go on?<eos> No, not on the phone.
One of the angriest men I've ever known, actually.<eos> Is that right?<eos> It's one of the things that made me curious about you.<eos> All that rage.<eos> You told Dar Adal you recruited Ivan Krupin in Iraq?<eos> I did.<eos> Care to explain how a junior officer fails to report the recruitment of a major asset up the chain?<eos> I did report it.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> To?

I'm fine. I'm just not myself right now.<eos> Okay, well, I hope to see you soon, and, feel better.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> You should stay away from the cheese curds.<eos> They're addicting.<eos> I'm going to take a wild stab and guess that you're here without the consent of the rest of your fabulous team.<eos> It's been difficult, having you here.<eos> For all of us.
Yeah, right.<eos> Look, I'm gonna bail you out of here, set you up with my lawyer, and get these charges dropped.<eos> Well, how you gonna do that?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll come up with a good story, and they'll eat it up.<eos> Not like when I read my JAG fan fiction at the NCIS convention.<eos> "JAG stood up and yelled,<eos> "'Objection, Your Honor, by Navy law.'<eos> "He then turned to the lady lawyer, "the gal from the October Maxim, "who still managed to be hot<eos> Or perhaps because of it."
We love you.<eos> Who--who am I?<eos> She's speaking because she's remembering.<eos> Laurel!<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm fine!<eos> She just...<eos> She needs more time.<eos> I think you better add "get an entirely new police force"<eos> to your campaign platform.
Is that still the case?<eos> Do what you got to do.<eos> I guess you know your Miranda rights.<eos> You got your own key or something?<eos> What you said to Warner saved my life. I...<eos> I didn't know you had such a way with words.<eos> Well, I don't do encores.<eos> You believe what you said?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Every word.
- All they do is gossip.<eos> - About us, specifically?<eos> You mean about your stupid column?<eos> - Well, maybe.<eos> - So yesterday's news.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Tell me about Denis.<eos> - The guy who drives the bus?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Why?
- That's what I told the person who told me.<eos> -Which was who?<eos> Please don't do that thing where you'd rather not say.<eos> Oh, nah, no way.<eos> It was Zac.<eos> I'm just saying what I heard, OK?<eos> - Believe everything you hear?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, you clearly believe it enough to pass it on.<eos> Only to you.
No!<eos> No, why would you?<eos> Well, I keep asking myself the same question.<eos> Actually... ..I'm here to reassure you... ..about things being said about you.<eos> - They're not true.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> And I have the proof.<eos> You do?<eos> I made a few inquiries with my colleagues across the ditch...<eos> - Your colleagues?
This is what my help looks like.<eos> Oliver, I just saved you guys from whatever the hell Flock of Seagulls was about to do.<eos> The least you can do is...<eos> Barry, none of us have superpowers.<eos> You brought Kendra into our world without knowing who she is or what this dude that is after her is looking for.<eos> You made all of us unsafe.<eos> So maybe you ask the questions.<eos> We're all friends here, right?<eos> Why don't we go back to our place and have some drinks, and we can talk?<eos> Cool.
They didn't quite finish the job, now, did they?<eos> I'm not gonna make that mistake again.<eos> You're gonna leave Kendra alone.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> While my destiny is to live forever, Chay-Ara's is to die, as is yours now.<eos> - Any ideas?<eos> - Oh, now you'll listen to me?<eos> It's your city.<eos> All right, let's just try to get the staff.<eos> - All right, on my mark.
We're just taking our sweet time about it.<eos> So if you were smart, you'd put a bullet in me and then eat one yourself.<eos> Come on, Cass.<eos> Hmm.<eos> "Dean."<eos> As in Winchester?<eos> Probably.<eos> Do the honors.<eos> Morning, handsome!<eos> Efram.
We could be out of work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We get knocked out, it takes over.<eos> Someone's gotta do something.<eos> - Someone?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If management won't, it's up to the little guy.<eos> Yeah. I hear ya.<eos> Power to the people, my friend.<eos> Well, not actually people.
Did I hear someone mention dessert?<eos> In a minute, sweetheart.<eos> Now, what were we just chatting about?<eos> How when God created mankind, he really screwed it up.<eos> Language!<eos> Is that any way for a primal force to speak?<eos> Every time I take in a soul, I feel how much emptiness there is.<eos> Yes.<eos> God made a world where people have to suffer, and then they die.<eos> - Unfortunately.
They were all murdered.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because someone tried to kill me yesterday, too.<eos> So, then why didn't you pull the fire alarm?<eos> The FBI, the NSA?<eos> Because you're at the center of all this, which makes you the only person I can trust.<eos> I haven't seen any of those people in over a year.<eos> What makes you think I'm at the heart of this?<eos> - Who did you tell about me?<eos> - Nobody.
I'd like that.<eos> So, do you need a lift, or are you just checking in on me?<eos> I'm happy you're alive.<eos> So, do you believe that Allison Hyde masterminded all of this?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Neither do you.<eos> Hyde was a convenient scapegoat.<eos> The person behind the Loksat memo is still out there, still thriving.<eos> - So, what should we do?<eos> - We?
Ah, roasted lizard with a little bit of coriander and sea salt.<eos> I've gotten better at removing the skin with a sharp rock.<eos> I ate already.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> It's a hard day.<eos> Taiana...<eos> I have to...<eos> I have to tell you something about your brother.<eos> Vlad?
I think if you replay our conversation in your mind, our bargain was only at best implied.<eos> Even so, bad guy, remember?<eos> You let them go.<eos> I will. Existentially speaking.<eos> You do this, you lose any leverage that you have over me.<eos> Wrong.<eos> As long as they're alive, you have something to fight for.<eos> That is what I am taking away from you.<eos> But don't worry, it's painless.<eos> Well, mostly.
Oh, jeez. Thank you.<eos> Thank you, everyone.<eos> This week, an event just like this was interrupted by terrorists.<eos> But all of us are here tonight to send those people a very simple message.<eos> We're not gonna let the darkness win.<eos> So all of us are here to light a candle together.<eos> United.<eos> This right there's possible because of all of you, and I am grateful for each one of you.<eos> There is one person in particular that I am grateful for.<eos> You.
I can't let Lily bring him back.<eos> Oh, damn it!<eos> - Is it fixed yet?<eos> - Not yet, sweetheart, and it's past your bedtime.<eos> No!<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You want to brush your teeth?<eos> No! Ha ha ha!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, too bad.
When I regained consciousness, I was on the ship to England.<eos> Lily said Julian had found me robbed and beaten on the street.<eos> She believed him of course, and she healed me with her blood.<eos> Julian knew I could never tell Lily what he had done because that would also have exposed my lies.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She never would have forgiven me for having an affair with her son.<eos> I didn't want to live under Julian's thumb, so that night as we crossed the Atlantic, I drew myself a bath, laced my tea with laudanum, and went quietly to sleep...<eos> But I died with Lily's blood in my system... And by virtue of pure happenstance, I became the first heretic.<eos> You don't know how sorry I am...<eos> About everything.
I got your text.<eos> What happened?<eos> She got jumped.<eos> 3 vampires all dressed like yuppies.<eos> The Strix.<eos> Yeah. She needs your blood.<eos> You ok?<eos> Kind of hard to ignore it when someone needs your help, huh?<eos> They took it.<eos> The serratura.
Fat chicks with black hair get tattoos of me!<eos> God, I love this time of year.<eos> It's just past all the amazing colors of fall, and before the white of winter.<eos> Just brown and gray.<eos> Magical.<eos> All right, let's do this.<eos> All right, listen up, I'm the captain.<eos> The teams are chosen by a lottery system where...<eos> Aunt Karen, can I be on your team?<eos> Yeah, yeah, me, too!
I'm tired of you bullying me!<eos> You're going down! Butt-scratcher?<eos> !<eos> Butt-scratcher!<eos> D-D-D-Don't, K-K-Karen!<eos> Toxic Shock!<eos> Toxic Shock!<eos> Oh, my God, she's taking it too far!<eos> Heavy Flo is gonna break this girl's arms!<eos> Woman's arms.
No single men on their own.<eos> And the book, did we find it?<eos> Well, it wasn't checked out, but it's not here.<eos> Librarian said that they can give us some extra copies, and if there's anything...<eos> Jack.<eos> Jack!<eos> I heard Roth got pretty dark on the Hillside Strangler case...<eos> Tough on everybody around him, including his partner.<eos> I mean, good luck, man. It looks like he's taking a nose dive on your watch now.<eos> Yeah, no thanks to you two.
Well, sounds like a bit of a cooling-off period. Trying to keep his urges at bay.<eos> Yeah, that's... that's exactly what I was thinking.<eos> What's with the smile?<eos> We're talking about a serial killer here.<eos> Well, I like talking shop with you.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> This place is such a dump.<eos> It's even worse during the day, huh?<eos> I like it here.<eos> Me, too.
Your laws... mean nothing.<eos> I die... a hundred more take my place.<eos> Allah Akbar.<eos> Allah Akbar.<eos> God... is... great.<eos> You're sure you're ready to die, Samir?<eos> Is that it?<eos> I know what's waiting for me.<eos> There's no virgins waiting for you, my friend.<eos> Johannam.
I'd call us a pretty open bunch, but you don't think there's things we don't know about each other we're better off not knowing?<eos> Sleep better at night not knowing?<eos> Like how Mom and Dad were better off before they knew - that big mouth here drank at parties.<eos> - All right.<eos> You're on a slippery slope, Sean, but if you take that idea and expand it out over, say, the eight million people walking around this city, not all of them looking to do good.<eos> There probably is a lot of things that I'd rather not know about.<eos> You got that right.<eos> You mean what you guys know.<eos> The near misses and stuff.<eos> Not just us, but sure.
Is that why you're rushing into doing this? No.<eos> I'd like to hook this up to you and do the same thing.<eos> Is your name Yagami Light?<eos> Is Misa okay?<eos> Is it Yagami Light? Well?<eos> Is it Yagami Light?<eos> No.<eos> Then I'll come right to the question.<eos> Are you really...<eos> Hey...
Let's go.<eos> This is the old Shaver Transportation Company.<eos> This is where she brought you?<eos> Bodies are inside.<eos> Let's make sure nobody else is.<eos> So these people you were supposed to meet, any idea who they were?<eos> No.<eos> Chavez said something was coming, that we needed to be prepared.<eos> Prepared for what?<eos> An uprising.
But, for you, it...<eos> I don't want you to stay with me just because I'm the first.<eos> So, you should see other people.<eos> You should.<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> - I only meant...<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> .. that there's only just one other person out there for you.<eos> Scottie?<eos> Scottie?
I don't want you to stay with me just because I'm the first.<eos> So, you should see other people.<eos> You should.<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> - I only meant...<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> .. that there's only just one other person out there for you.<eos> Scottie?<eos> Scottie?<eos> Scottie?
By right, it belongs to young Ragnar.<eos> Yes.<eos> But we spend what we need to spend.<eos> We stay alive.<eos> We tell the story, and then what?<eos> We find a new lord to serve.<eos> I will not stand by and have everything that's mine taken from me.<eos> I'm going back.<eos> - Where?<eos> - To the beginning.
- My Lord, please.<eos> Beocca, help me!<eos> Beocca!<eos> Have faith!<eos> - qui es unicus victoria largitor...<eos> Hold!<eos> Left flank, hold!<eos> Hold!<eos> Archers, ready!<eos> On my command!
You are God's King, Alfred of Wessex.<eos> VivatRexAlfredus!<eos> ALL: (CHANTING) VivatRexAlfredus!<eos> I can't imagine a time without you.<eos> (CHANTING CONTINUES)<eos> (PANTING)<eos> It is Guthrum?<eos> Yes.<eos> You can see a bone in his hair, it's his mother's rib.<eos> How endearing.
Stop that!<eos> I believe you did this.<eos> The great hall is now full!<eos> There is no more room!<eos> Please, the King thanks you all for coming, - but you need to pray here outside.<eos> - Father Beocca!<eos> - The palace is full!<eos> - Father Beocca!<eos> There will be ale and food available<eos> - for everyone...
What is it?<eos> Promise me you will come back safely.<eos> Two arms, both ears.<eos> Promise me.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> But only if you do the same.<eos> If they come, don't shelter in a church or a nunnery.<eos> Go to the hills, the woods.<eos> I'll come.<eos> For both of you.
Quietly.<eos> And if anyone asks why?<eos> Just say it's a drill or something.<eos> We want to keep our options open until we know more.<eos> Thank you, everybody.<eos> Ma'am, you have the merchant marine event this afternoon.<eos> You wanted me to remind you that Secretary Albright will be there.<eos> Right. I, um...<eos> I want to wear that pin that she gave me.<eos> Yes, ma'am.
Why aren't they asking for money or a prisoner exchange?<eos> Why the hell do they want to talk to me?<eos> Dmitri's story checks out.<eos> His sister Talia was admitted to Muromskaya Hospital with advanced fibrosarcoma of the bone.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> It's bad luck.<eos> For who?<eos> For us, or for Dmitri's sister?<eos> Both.
It was actually my conversation with him that convinced me not to...<eos> Because I... I realized it's a matter of life and death.<eos> She's an undercover cop.<eos> The killer told me that himself, which means...<eos> Which means that her life is in danger if her cover's blown.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So it's... it's not information I can just sit on.<eos> But what do I do?<eos> Who do I tell?<eos> No one.
I'm so sorry.<eos> * ohhhhh *<eos> You don't think so?<eos> Yeah, it's good. It's fine.<eos> All right. Huh?<eos> I got a lot to tell you tomorrow night.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> All right. You too.
So it's simple.<eos> Tell them to back off or else.<eos> Hi, Colette. It's Betty Beaumontaine.<eos> Yeah, it's been a while.<eos> Listen, I'm running point for our hospital's charity ball this year, and I'm working the list for the fire department and LAPD.<eos> Just want to make sure that the lists with the addresses are all updated.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I'll come by and pick them up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You, too.
What about, uh, 2030?<eos> Bingo.<eos> This has got to be it.<eos> There's a Hobie's ice cream right nearby.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Well, it's so nice to have girlfriend time for a change.<eos> Nancy, until you came by today, I forgot how much I missed it.<eos> Need it.<eos> Life-affirming, almost.<eos> For me, too.
You don't have to cook, you don't have to wash.<eos> I need time for me. I need more time for my children.<eos> We have massage, gymnastics, then we go to the pool and we eat healthy.<eos> It's very yummy.<eos> I don't understand why the government does this.<eos> Because it's cheaper.<eos> In the long run, it's cheaper.<eos> Definitely.<eos> To prevent worse sickness. Mm-hmm. Yeah.<eos> And what about the kids also?
Oh, my God!<eos> It's camp!<eos> Somebody has a guitar.<eos> Come on, what have you got to lose?<eos> Every day is supposed to be an adventure here.<eos> Just don't play free fallin'.<eos> Deal.<eos> Here's a guitar.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, everyone.
I wish I could make it better for you.<eos> Lily?<eos> Maybe I could write to you, maybe send you some Golden-seal for...<eos> I never want to see you again.<eos> I hate you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> New place, couldn't sleep.<eos> Isn't it the baby that's supposed to keep the parents awake?<eos> Kelly's got a lot less to worry about.<eos> For now at least.
It's done.<eos> - She bought it?<eos> - She did.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Did you think I couldn't handle it?<eos> I guess I was just worried that she'd figure it out anyway, expose me, and then...<eos> There is no "and then."<eos> Because that didn't happen.<eos> Because of you.<eos> Because of us.
! Are congratulations in order?<eos> You, uh... you flatter me.<eos> These things are so cool.<eos> They're Bluetooth-enabled pacifiers, from England.<eos> Here, let me...<eos> Hold this.<eos> The teat can measure temperature... knows its own location, and then it tracks the medications that you're giving your child... and then all that information is sent back to the parent's phone.<eos> Or in this case, my tablet.<eos> 37 degrees Celsius.<eos> 98.6 Fahrenheit.
Or he works here.<eos> It's an employee-only computer.<eos> Kyle Bristow was a customer.<eos> Wait a minute, that's the same photo he used on Kyle's fake HeartMate dating profile.<eos> Pull up the invoice.<eos> Kyle Bristow dropped off that picture a month ago.<eos> Here you go, Mr. Bristow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How's that Rizzo case going?<eos> Not great.
No, no, no. I won't kill Emma.<eos> Yeah, but there's always a loophole.<eos> Killian!<eos> It worked!<eos> - You're alive!<eos> - Aye. It did.<eos> After spending centuries quelling my bloodlust, you threw me right back into that darkness!<eos> Job well-done, Emma!<eos> Binding you to Excalibur was the only way to save you.<eos> Right, Excalibur.
Binding you to Excalibur was the only way to save you.<eos> Right, Excalibur.<eos> And where is my shiny new tether?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It disappeared right after you did.<eos> Ah.<eos> Isn't that convenient?<eos> How long has he been with you?<eos> You can still see him?<eos> Sadly, yes.
His name was Jeremy Dolan.<eos> He was reported missing 36 hours ago from Rogers Park.<eos> He was eight years old.<eos> His parents are Richard and Rochelle.<eos> They're waiting at the morgue to ID the body.<eos> Rogers Park... that's three miles north of that house.<eos> Well, he was probably killed elsewhere, transported to the scene.<eos> We got no eyeball witnesses of the body being placed, though.<eos> Do we know who owns the house?<eos> Yep, local real-estate investors.
This is why I didn't tell you what I was doing.<eos> Because I didn't think you'd understand.<eos> Oh, I understand, Kevin.<eos> You're all about the work now.<eos> Working late, working weekends, neglecting your wife, your child, your lawn, and then?<eos> You die alone.<eos> You enjoy your miserable future.<eos> Don't!<eos> Well, looks like you're having guy problems, too.<eos> Patti?
- Yeah, that was pretty lame. - (sighs)<eos> I tried to time that so I'd be in the reflection when you closed it.<eos> I misjudged.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Aside from you tearing my family apart.<eos> Daddy, it's me!<eos> Ready for dinner on you.<eos> Daddy?<eos> (giggles) Dinner?
Yeah, of course.<eos> -Yeah. -Yes, come on in. Have a...<eos> Have a seat... - Okay.<eos> - On the sofa.<eos> - Sit. (chuckles)<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - (sighs) - Let's see what movies are on.<eos> I don't know. Maybe moving in with Brock was a huge mistake.<eos> - Oh! - Oh.<eos> - For me?
Mmm. Since I was a teenager, before Arkfall. Oh...<eos> You know, these coffee plants grow in Peru. There's a little area miraculously untouched by Arkfall.<eos> My father used to take me camping there.<eos> He wanted me to appreciate the world that was.<eos> He sounds so progressive.<eos> He was.<eos> Unfortunately, it's what got him shot in the head.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - Oh. Don't be. Onulu Toruku had enemies to spare.<eos> Onulu Toruku?
Thank God.<eos> Doc says he's resting comfortably, be out of there tomorrow.<eos> That's good news.<eos> But this reporter was sitting in the back of one of our RMPs, and he was wearing a department issued NYPD windbreaker.<eos> I'm not sure the shooter thought he was shooting a reporter.<eos> He could have thought he was killing a cop.<eos> Let's get to it.<eos> Find this guy.<eos> I'm sorry this happened.<eos> Me, too.
Seems you and him had a lengthy conversation.<eos> Yeah, all right, all right, all right.<eos> So the man called me last night-- so what?<eos> For what?<eos> He want to interview you?<eos> He said all kind of whack noise like that.<eos> I told him to step off, man.<eos> Step off a building, is that what you told him?<eos> Speak to in person, or on the phone?<eos> On the phone.
She should take him through that door any moment.<eos> Copy that.<eos> I guess it's too late to ask you to go with me.<eos> I'm sorry, Joe.<eos> Wow.<eos> You're good.<eos> Sniper?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, you know, I'm sorry, too.<eos> For everything.
Brooks, there's nothing for you to do.<eos> Is it true, Raul?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's them, isn't it?<eos> Same ones as before.<eos> Brooks, you need to go home and wait for me to call you with any news.<eos> It's worse at home and you know it.<eos> The Feds are on their way.<eos> Behavioral specialists.<eos> Behavior specialists.
!<eos> Christa, he's crashing!<eos> All it took was 2 milliliters of calcium gluconate, and this monster is still alive.<eos> I'm gonna go throw up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, Cornelius?<eos> Hey, uh, I don't want to be that guy, but, uh, the O'Brien mother is still sitting with her son's body, and it's been over three hours.<eos> We're as overbooked as a whorehouse on a Saturday night, folks.<eos> I need the room.<eos> Shame on you.
Here she comes.<eos> The arrest warrant, as promised.<eos> Now, you owe me, butter, and don't think it's gonna be small.<eos> When is it ever small with me?<eos> - (Laughs)<eos> - Ugh.<eos> Okay, who is this bitch?<eos> FRANK: We got to go.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Butter?
And the good people stop them.<eos> Gibson snapped.<eos> He's unpredictable now.<eos> He's still got a missile left.<eos> Who's his next target?<eos> I was hoping you were gonna tell me that.<eos> I don't know, man, the guy's vindictive.<eos> He's trying to hurt the people that hurt him.<eos> Powers?<eos> Me?
Your relationship with Agent Weller is... complicated.<eos> He's your colleague, your protector, your childhood friend.<eos> Yeah, and now he's in my dreams.<eos> He's everywhere.<eos> I think we need to consider you stepping down as lead agent on this case.<eos> It's not necessary.<eos> Maybe you need to establish clearer boundaries.<eos> How do I do that?<eos> To start... try keeping your interactions with him limited to a professional context.<eos> At least for now.
Occultatum Libera!<eos> You know, I'm getting a little sick of hearing that.<eos> The bed's ready.<eos> Nick... they're gonna take me.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You're with me.<eos> I have so much to tell you.<eos> Shh. Later.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> Yeah, thanks to your friend.
My team's handling international traffic.<eos> In the meantime, sir, I advise evacuating all federally employed aid workers in and near ISIS territory.<eos> Do it.<eos> Good morning, Madam Secretary.<eos> I wish I could agree.<eos> I have the number for Luke Miller's parents when you're ready for condolences, ma'am.<eos> I have a P.A. working every international search and social media platform, burying that video so deep even Criterion Collection won't find it.<eos> Good.<eos> And line up assistance for NGO workers - heeding our exit recommendation.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.
Black market ticks along in places like Syria and Iraq.<eos> The NGO folks don't like to talk about it, but corruption is what holds everything together.<eos> But then how can you trust any of it?<eos> I mean, like, this courier, he's dealing in stolen cargo?<eos> How do you...?<eos> Well, this guy is a former medic, so he's got a lot of real shady clients.<eos> And he's been vetted to high heaven.<eos> We figure that if it works for them, works for us.<eos> "Them" meaning who?<eos> ISIS?
And my dad.<eos> Okay, son, you're gonna have to wait out in the, uh, in the waiting area, okay?<eos> I can't get an airway.<eos> - Is he gonna be okay?<eos> - He's in good hands.<eos> Could you show him where to wait, please?<eos> Yeah, follow me.<eos> He's choking out, guys.<eos> Clavicle's pressing on the windpipe.<eos> Uh... towel clip.
Must be something about this face.<eos> You're tempted to keep that, aren't you?<eos> Well, what are you waiting for, permission?<eos> Go on, take it, buy yourself something pretty.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> But if you don't mind, I really must be on my way.<eos> Oh, yeah, of course.<eos> Hey, have a nice evening.<eos> You, too, Officer.<eos> You, too.
It's my daughter's doing.<eos> What's her endgame?<eos> War.<eos> It's what I promised her.<eos> When the Votanis Collective destroyed our fleet,<eos> Kindzi and I were lost.<eos> We knew the shape-takers had found a suitable planet to colonize.<eos> We just didn't know where it was.<eos> We drifted aimlessly through space, searching for any signal that would lead us to the Votan arks or their destination.<eos> Earth.
- I'm as good a horseman as anyone here.<eos> If it means more Danes will die, then I'll do it.<eos> Yes, Hild.<eos> You will.<eos> - Your horses... belong to whom?<eos> - The Lord Odda.<eos> You will let us pass.<eos> - You selling or buying?<eos> - Selling.<eos> To the Danes.
We'll need to get her into the O.R. now.<eos> - Mom, I'm gonna ask you to move away.<eos> - All right, Taylor.<eos> - Mom?<eos> Honey, it's okay.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You two are in my E.R. today?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - At your service.
Thank you.<eos> Get a good look.<eos> I'm assuming the other arm is the same?<eos> There is some damage you can't undo.<eos> Okay, well, make a fist.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm having some trouble finding a usable vein.<eos> Yeah, well, can't you just stick me somewhere else?<eos> Well, normally in these circumstances, I would use a central line, and I'd draw the blood from there, but that's not a good idea for you.<eos> For me.
I want to tell you how fabulous you look right now.<eos> I do?<eos> No.<eos> I want to tell you that, but then it'd be a lie.<eos> You look like you've been strapped to the bow of a ship.<eos> Is that so?<eos> No, no.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> You don't need any more laugh lines, believe me.<eos> Me?
I'm sorry.<eos> I just don't think that woman is using.<eos> I know a little bit more about this than you do.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> I'm not ashamed.<eos> I pulled myself out, and I'm fine now.<eos> What, do you two just not have enough to do?<eos> We're having a disagreement about a patient.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Which one?
I watch movies;<eos> I see what people do.<eos> What is this?<eos> Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.<eos> Oh!<eos> Wow!<eos> That's so great!<eos> Yeah, there's Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars.<eos> We're gonna have so much fun.<eos> We?
Pine Tree.<eos> Is that what you were going to call me?<eos> I was gonna say please, kid.<eos> Great-uncle Ford told me to protect the rift.<eos> Get one step closer and I'll shoot.<eos> I'll erase you right out of Ford's head.<eos> It's me, Dipper.<eos> It's your uncle.<eos> Trust no one, trust no one.<eos> - Trust...
Kids?<eos> Wife?<eos> Ex... wives.<eos> More than one.<eos> (chuckles)<eos> So you're doubly blessed.<eos> Which works for me.<eos> See, I hate to make threats, but I am about to do everything in my power to make sure you see those exes again.<eos> So you do your part, I'll do mine.<eos> Deal?
Oh, yeah.<eos> He just graduated Georgetown Law.<eos> Best thing I ever did was not take that job.<eos> That kid was a good reason why.<eos> Maybe you're another one, Gibbs.<eos> (monitors beeping rhythmically)<eos> (seagulls screeching)<eos> (giggling)<eos> I miss you, Kelly.<eos> You and Mom.
Ressler.<eos> Donald, you cannot let Agent Keen leave the embassy.<eos> Oh, you want a favor?<eos> How 'bout you come down here and ask him personally?<eos> Her life depends on it.<eos> 'Cause I'd be more inclined to help if I had you in cuffs.<eos> You cannot let her leave.<eos> You're preaching to the choir 'cause she's already gone.<eos> I received direct confirmation from the Russian Ambassador that Agent Keen's transfer was authorized by a high-level apparatchik in the Federal Tariff Service, a man named Vladimir Vitsin.<eos> - Vitsin?
Not anymore.<eos> I got us jobs at the juice bar.<eos> We can take all the classes and showers we want.<eos> I told them I had juicing experience... not a lie if you count the week I dated Lance Armstrong.<eos> Earl, this one shower, the water comes at you from every angle, and not because sewage is backing up.<eos> You do seem happier, Max.<eos> You're even kinda smiling.<eos> How high are you right now?<eos> No, I am totally clean.<eos> Literally.
Especially a man like Dan Hauser.<eos> Goes nuts while grieving, kills for revenge, it's a sad story.<eos> - I heard you and Hauser were close.<eos> - Not close.<eos> We crossed paths.<eos> He used the library to work on his appeal, I escorted him, gave us time to talk.<eos> Must have meant a lot to him to have a friendly ear.<eos> Of course.<eos> Being an innocent man behind bars is hard.<eos> Innocent?
Things are different now.<eos> - Different how?<eos> - They're just different.<eos> Is there something you're tryin' to tell me?<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> Help me?<eos> You been on the sidelines too long.<eos> It's time to hang up your wingtips.<eos> I know...<eos> Jesus Christ.
He... he never mentioned anything about a wedding.<eos> How about the hotel?<eos> Did he have business in the area? Was he...?<eos> I...<eos> You weren't concerned when he didn't come home?<eos> He works extended shifts all the time.<eos> What's ironic-- when Max flew with the Navy, he was gone... for months.<eos> Trained to be a drone pilot so he could spend more quality time with us.<eos> But the military was short on UAV operators, and Max...<eos> Especially hard on a kid.
!<eos> Wha...<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because you gave it to me when we first started dating, and I knew it was important to you, so... I lied.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have to get this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> You too.<eos> Vikram.
It's because of what he might do to them if he ever lost his temper.<eos> (SCOFFS)<eos> WOMAN: Ma'am?<eos> You just might want to look at this.<eos> MAXWELL: (ON TV) I'm just glad these two men were only in the hospital, and not the morgue.<eos> We're all so worried about police brutality, maybe we ought to put a body camera on Supergirl.<eos> 0930. Have to get to work.<eos> Oh, by the way, my dad's in town.<eos> (SLURPING)<eos> On business.
I need to find out what really happened to him.<eos> If the DEO knows about your dad, why don't you just go ask them?<eos> Because if they wanted to tell me the truth, they would have done it already.<eos> Please?<eos> You're the only one that can help us.<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay, I'm in.<eos> (CELL PHONE CHIMES)<eos> Henshaw's calling...<eos> Yeah, me too.
For example, I am so furious with my mother, so I took it out on you.<eos> And this is the important bit, you weren't really mad at me.<eos> Actually, I kind of was.<eos> No.<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> You were really mad, at something else.<eos> You need to find, find that anger behind the anger.<eos> And you need to figure out what is really making you mad.<eos> Thank you for dinner, Dad.<eos> My pleasure.
Alex, what are you doing?<eos> I am not the enemy.<eos> So, is that why you didn't tell me about my father?<eos> I found out he was DEO.<eos> And that you blackmailed him to serve under you.<eos> Your father believed in me.<eos> He was a great man...<eos> You don't get to talk about him!<eos> You chain yourself.<eos> - To those bars there.
I'm hungry.<eos> Absolutely, ma'am.<eos> What do you have in mind?<eos> Anything.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Got a little bit of traffic, but don't worry--<eos> I got just the place.<eos> Sit back and relax.<eos> I got you.<eos> Okay, down the hall?
You lie about why you came here,<eos> You lie about how you feel about Josh.<eos> You lie about why you want to become friends with Valencia.<eos> Okay, okay, that's enough!<eos> God!<eos> Let's just do this stupid meeting with these stupid clients.<eos> Hello, gentlemen.<eos> So we heard most of that.<eos> I'm realizing that now as I see the horrified looks on your faces.<eos> One sec... _
See you in a bit.<eos> Right, I'm going to scoot too.<eos> What, is it something I said?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just going to go and sit with Dad.<eos> He seems to like it this time of day.<eos> Toodle pip!<eos> My wife's thinking of getting a new car.<eos> Hatchback.<eos> Card.
Whereas we...<eos> Do you know my wife spends her waking hours volunteering for every bloody charity you can think of?<eos> She's more interested in strangers than she is me.<eos> We just live in this... fog.<eos> I couldn't save my girl and now I can't save my wife.<eos> I wanted to make him hurt a little.<eos> I could do that, at least.<eos> I'm sorry, Frank, we're going to have to take you down the station.<eos> 16.<eos> Card.
Always cash.<eos> - I'm guessing that's not good.<eos> - It just makes it more difficult for us to prove that you bought it.<eos> You're not covering for your daughter, are you, Mrs. Sachs?<eos> Have you ever shopped at the store? At Salvatori's?<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> - I have, a few times.<eos> They don't want me to shop there.<eos> They tend to make it difficult for you.<eos> Not for you, but for us.
It's an electronic identifier attached to every sales item - to keep it from being stolen.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Get up here, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> No, not you.<eos> This is not To Kill a Mockingbird.<eos> This is not Anatomy of a Murder.<eos> This is a constitutionally mandated necessity.<eos> It is Lucille Ball wrapping chocolates on an assembly line.<eos> Cases get processed, justice is served for the greater whole.<eos> Not for you, not for her.

What?<eos> I am getting too old for this crud.<eos> Amy, I noticed your status still says "in a relationship" on Facebook.<eos> You're right.<eos> I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know.<eos> Penny, I'm no longer in a relationship.<eos> Did you change yours to "married" yet?<eos> Uh, no, not yet.<eos> There's still a few people I haven't told personally.<eos> Who?

The whole week up until Zac was murdered he was getting voicemails from the same number, but each time the caller says nothing.<eos> And this happened 12 times the day Zac was murdered.<eos> T-welve.<eos> They're from an 877 number. It's probably a pay-as-you-go.<eos> Okay, well, who would make an anonymous call and then stay on the line and say nothing?<eos> - Times 12.<eos> - Somebody who's super pissed.<eos> Super pissed enough to kill?<eos> Let me have a listen.<eos> To the dead air?
Meal from Mom, it's comfort food.<eos> If I had the chance, I would tell him that being independent doesn't have to mean being alone.<eos> He always said he was fine.<eos> I just wish... I wish I had made him open up to me more, you know.<eos> I do.<eos> Thanks to the efforts of our dedicated 2nd Precinct detectives, we have made an arrest in the murder of Zac Romero.<eos> Jordan Pelham is in custody.<eos> Did Santiani actually just compliment us?<eos> - Don't get used to it.<eos> - Used to it?
Almost like we're the real bad guys because we're trying to catch Kira.<eos> Matsuda!<eos> Sorry!<eos> Is this really okay?<eos> He's the detective L chose. We just have to trust him.<eos> But he's really not as good as L, is he?<eos> Representative Imaizaka is receiving support within his party.<eos> He also said that it is important to find ways to cooperate with Kira.<eos> Just between you and me... bullying and stuff has dropped in my school, too.<eos> Thanks to Kira, maybe?
Said he needed a quiet place to study away from the frat house.<eos> I work at residential housing, so I hooked him up with an empty apartment on the D.L.<eos> Why didn't you tell the cops?<eos> My dad's a lawyer, and he taught me you never trust the police.<eos> Actually, you know, he also taught me that blondes are more fun.<eos> What say we go out later?<eos> My crew and I found this great bar last night called Jinx.<eos> I'd love to, but I'm actually getting fitted for an iron lung in the morning.<eos> Bye.<eos> Okay, Vikram.
- I'm invisible.<eos> - Hang on a second.<eos> I'm gonna go downstairs and talk to Olga, the stranger who finds me more interesting than my own mother.<eos> Ali, that... I...<eos> Since when did you become the easy daughter?<eos> I'm actually learning all about that in my child psych class.<eos> It's, like, classic middle kid stuff.<eos> Okay.<eos> But... is she right?<eos> The truth?
All right.<eos> Thanks for letting me know.<eos> It's Gorev.<eos> Olga.<eos> It's your dad.<eos> I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.<eos> Come, come, come.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Not so well.<eos> But, uh, sober, at least.
Can I have a moment of your time?<eos> White folks are always taking my time.<eos> I have an opportunity to lift the U.S. embargo, but I need your help.<eos> There are people who want you to come back to the U.S. to serve your sentence.<eos> What if I could ensure that you would be at a minimum-security prison close to your daughter in Connecticut?<eos> You have a grandson you haven't met.<eos> And you would be eligible for parole in three years.<eos> Wouldn't that be convenient for you?<eos> I simply turn myself over to the Feds, and you get whatever it is you want.<eos> Not just me.
Yes.<eos> So tell me.<eos> Why do you not take your revenge?<eos> Because he might be the only one who can synthesize a cure.<eos> Yes.<eos> Very good.<eos> I know how frustrating it is.<eos> It seems like sometimes to save humanity, we have to put up with a few disagreeable men.<eos> That is going to change.<eos> Now this one.
Mr. Grazioso didn't kill Ronald Green.<eos> Well, we'll have a nice long trial to prove just that.<eos> Actually, I don't think it will take very long.<eos> I do like your confidence.<eos> I have an alibi witness who will swear that my client was in his apartment ten blocks away when Mr. Green was murdered.<eos> And let me guess.<eos> It's one of your client's mob associates?<eos> As a matter of fact, yes.<eos> And you're gonna hang your entire defense on the credibility of a gangster?<eos> Well, not just any gangster.
If our guys, starting with you and me, can't get along, it is the people we serve who get caught in the crossfire.<eos> You first.<eos> Well, you're right.<eos> No jury's gonna convict your men for endangering mine.<eos> And I have no appetite for the circus that arresting them would cause.<eos> So that's off the table?<eos> It can be.<eos> If?<eos> If... you make a public apology to my officer,<eos> Derek Redlich.
Another day at the office.<eos> That puppy nearly got me get killed.<eos> Well, the way I see it, we nail Brock for killing Green or killing you.<eos> Either way we get our man.<eos> (chuckles) You get what you need?<eos> Yes. You really went out on a limb for me, Vincent.<eos> What can I do?<eos> I-I'm a sucker for a pretty face.<eos> I'm sorry about your partner.<eos> Yeah, me too.
(muffled protests)<eos> (groans)<eos> (doorbell rings)<eos> (doorbell rings)<eos> It's for me.<eos> (groans)<eos> (exhales)<eos> GROVER: Pulled security footage from the heist and ran our thief through facial rec.<eos> Didn't get any hits on the guy but we did get one back on his hostage.<eos> Hostage?

Detective Bell.<eos> Ms. Watson.<eos> I'm Curtis Tofano.<eos> You wanted to talk to me?<eos> Mr. Tofano, there was a double-homicide in Tribeca the night before last.<eos> Two men who looked a lot alike. It made the news.<eos> Maybe you saw it?<eos> Uh, sorry.<eos> Do you know someone named<eos> Unfortunately, yeah.
That coupled with Officer Cudlow's insistence he was not aware of Dorian Moll has left me with a rather nasty taste in my mouth.<eos> We've missed something.<eos> Oriskany Falls University had an enrollment of nearly 3,000 people in 2004.<eos> Perhaps we could attend one of their reunions, make cheek swabs a condition of entry.<eos> Oriskany Falls is in Central New York, right?<eos> Last time I checked.<eos> And the police there confirm that all the other members of Kappa Rho Pi from 2004 passed their DNA tests.<eos> Correct.<eos> Who are you calling?<eos> Marcus.
But one day, Mr. Michaels, I may come asking for a favor.<eos> Of course, there's a chance I won't.<eos> It all depends on what the powers that be require at any given time.<eos> Sounds kind of dangerous.<eos> We're dangerous men.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Jon Bennett.<eos> Would you like to see how dangerous I am, Mr. Bennett?<eos> Not the face, man.<eos> Not the face.
No, that would make us heroes.<eos> He wants us to die failing to save people.<eos> We left our car and walked out here.<eos> Why?<eos> I needed to make sure you weren't being tracked by your team.<eos> We dumped our comms like you asked.<eos> And I'm supposed to just trust that your superiors didn't inject you with-with a LoJack?<eos> You have our attention.<eos> Now what?<eos> Straight to the chase.
Now for sure you got a question to ask me, don't you?<eos> You want to know... who gave me the names of the Federal Agents that shot my little brother.<eos> You guys don't got a clue.<eos> One of your own... is gonna burn you down from the inside.<eos> Show us your other hand, Brunson.<eos> What?<eos> Uh, nothing.<eos> I'm done, so...<eos> I guess have a good night.<eos> You, too.
Okay, I hate to interrupt whatever's going on here, but you're needed in Ops stat-- we have a case.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Let's go.<eos> This is David Ramsey.<eos> Oh, he's rocking a Clash T-shirt.<eos> A man after my own heart.<eos> He's a former DARPA engineer.<eos> He left the DoD after his brother died of leukemia.<eos> He then moved to Los Angeles and joined the Church of the Unlocked Mind.<eos> - Those guys.

What do you want?<eos> I want you to lay off of Maggie...<eos> - Uh, Rossum.<eos> - Rossum.<eos> She paid her debt.<eos> I am looking at a cancelled check here that you guys cashed.<eos> The account is settled, Bob.<eos> Look, look, I'll try to get this straightened out, but it's not just up to me, you got to know that.<eos> Who's it up to, Bob?<eos> My manager, Nelson Olstead.
Hello, Father.<eos> I want to run something by you, but I need your undivided attention.<eos> I'm thinking of taking pole dancing classes.<eos> What do you think?<eos> If it makes you happy, dear.<eos> Do you know Eyal Naftali?<eos> - Is that a club?<eos> - He's the chief of staff to Israel's communications minister.<eos> He wants to talk to you about running his campaign.<eos> His campaign for what?
I-I went to high school with his brother.<eos> This is crazy what's happening.<eos> You know, they kidnapped a guy too. Yeah, we know.<eos> Xavier.<eos> He's a friend.<eos> How could somebody do something like that?<eos> I've got a bad feeling about this.<eos> I mean, a really bad feeling.<eos> I mean, a feeling so bad that it's got to mean something.<eos> Something bad.
- Carol, come on.<eos> - It's just not like them.<eos> And it's definitely not like<eos> - them to not leave a note or something.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I know how much you wanted to see them.<eos> Yeah, I wanted to see them.<eos> But not as much as I wanted to see you.<eos> My house?
Come on! Come on!<eos> You know, you came close there, pal.<eos> You should've left me up there.<eos> Okay, first of all, you don't tell me what I should've done.<eos> Secondly, you're not that lucky.<eos> You're gonna pay for what you did to those women.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You recognize that thing?<eos> Yeah, it's my girlfriend's.<eos> My ex-girlfriend.
You can try crushing it.<eos> But nothing...<eos> Nothing, I mean nothing destroys the Flexi-box.<eos> Aw, man!<eos> I used to love this commercial.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> So, that Flexi-Box is the last hit Nesbit had?<eos> That's one hell of a sophomore slump.<eos> Hey, you got to admire to admire the guy for never giving up on his dream, right?<eos> Even in the face of failure.
Hey, hang on, um, Angie.<eos> There's... there's something else.<eos> You arranged a show for me at Founding Fathers?<eos> And it's tonight?<eos> Well, you wouldn't have agreed if I'd given you advance notice.<eos> I'm not agreeing now.<eos> Come on, Angie.<eos> I just sent out a few postcards.<eos> To whom?<eos> No one, really.
Oh, and, Spence, I showed him the picture of when you first visited and he started kicking his little legs and he smiled real big.<eos> Who wouldn't get excited seeing that bella faccia? I think he wants to see you.<eos> You know, studies have shown that babies begin exhibiting cognizable nonverbal communication within days of birth.<eos> And some things never change. Yeah.<eos> And some things do, And because of that, we took the liberty of doing... this.<eos> It's all the pictures you sent while you were away.<eos> You guys, I love it.<eos> It's--it's perfect.<eos> Thank you, all of you.<eos> Almost all of you.
I was going around, introducing myself, handing out those croissants that I made.<eos> Yeah, I remember you.<eos> Look, just as a tip, we don't... actually, like, talk to each other around here.<eos> That guy has lived next-door to me for, like, 11 years, and, like, I say "guy," but honestly, it could be, like...<eos> - a stack of cats in a jumpsuit.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Appreciate the info.<eos> But... I like to consider myself a bridge builder, and I feel like you and I could shake things up around here.<eos> Yeah, no, I don't see that happening, but anyways... nice to meet you, stack of cats in a...<eos> - shirt.
With a minor adjustment for the castrati.<eos> I am never making conversation with you again.<eos> What's this?<eos> You supposed to be some sort of stick insect?<eos> I'm not really concerned about my appearance.<eos> I'm more concerned about obtaining an optimal cardiovascular workout, you know?<eos> Which reminds me... you have yet to sponsor me, Zachary.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, that's because I've donated to some other people.<eos> Whom?

WOMAN 2:<eos> Ms. Sciuto?<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh!<eos> Nice parasol.<eos> Dr. Janice Brown.<eos> You came to talk with me about a compound?<eos> Yes, right.<eos> This is for you.<eos> This way.
Oh, he's so cute.<eos> (car alarm chirping)<eos> Okay, we need to get the Internet back online and call for help.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> But you can't hack something that isn't connected, and we are not connected.<eos> Well, then we're stuck.<eos> Because the Ebola lockdown sealed all of our perimeters, so we need a blowtorch to get out.<eos> Well, we can't just sit here.<eos> I'm okay with standing.<eos> Me, too.
We are coming after you.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Oh, big announcement.<eos> Citywide crackdown on the Utopium scourge.<eos> To this end, we have formed a Utopium task force, headed by a colleague I am pleased to welcome back from sabbatical, assistant DA Peyton Charles.<eos> Peyton? Thank you, District Attorney Baracus, for the confidence you've placed in me.<eos> I promise I will not let you down...<eos> I don't suppose she told you she was back in the country.<eos> No.<eos> You?
According to The Ledger, that's standard operating procedure for you and your crew.<eos> - That article was just mean and...<eos> - So you sent death-threats to Terrence Van Doren and then ran his car into the Hudson with Isabel Van Doren inside.<eos> I was in bed with my wife when that crash happened.<eos> - You can ask her.<eos> - We will.<eos> Maybe one of your biker buddies wanted some highway justice, huh?<eos> They all did, but not with violence.<eos> - Then how?<eos> - Legally.
There, on the river.<eos> You think that Van Doren swam away?<eos> No.<eos> But, maybe, he took a taxi.<eos> Try a gondolier up river if you're looking for a romantic ride.<eos> Strictly platonic.<eos> Tell us about your routes.<eos> Uh, ferry service all day long.<eos> Party-boats at night.<eos> What about the mornings?
It's detective Laura Diamond, NYPD.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Come in, Detective.<eos> Now.<eos> Don't think I don't know how to shoot this.<eos> Hunting is one of my husband's favorite hobbies.<eos> I'm on your side, Isabel.<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> My husband has a lot of people on his payroll including cops.<eos> Not this one.
Ma-Mariel--<eos> Ay, what's wrong with me?<eos> M-Mariel...<eos> Somebody order six large pizzas?<eos> Hey, uh, somebody pay the pizza guy.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> We're here for the party.<eos> We should be on the list.<eos> Oh. Aw, yeah, my bad.
- Yes. - In your opinion, why hasn't the Bureau reciprocated?<eos> Because the person responsible is FBI Special Agent Elizabeth Keen.<eos> So you don't share Agent Ressler's opinion that she's innocent?<eos> Elizabeth Keen is a Russian sleeper agent.<eos> She said as much to Agent Ressler when she scaled the wall of the Russian embassy, admitted that her real name is Masha Rostova, and asked for asylum.<eos> And the Fulcrum?<eos> The Fulcrum is an irrelevant relic, which, in case you haven't read Cathcart's piece in the Post, is being systematically debunked as we speak.<eos> He likens it to The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion, uh, which has taken a few anomalous grains of truth and spun a mountain of lies, concocted by conspiracy theorists.<eos> Forgive me, but I don't draw my evidence from the popular press.<eos> Facts, then.
But he texted the same...<eos> It's not him.<eos> Uh, do you know who it is?<eos> I do not.<eos> And that's for you to ask Sheila.<eos> But Trey Delgado remains the cop you mentored and the man you respect.<eos> I was in your shoes a few years back, and a man we work with helped me.<eos> A lot.<eos> I'm still married, thanks in part to him.<eos> Who?
- The man you love... - El hombre que amabas...<eos> The man who loved you...<eos> El hombre que te amaba...<eos> - Can save his life. - Puede salvar su vida.<eos> Wait.<eos> Si.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll alert the transplant team.<eos> Central line.
And he'll say he's uncomfortable and I'll say I understand and we'll pick someone else.<eos> So?<eos> I can't imagine Mateo's godfather being anyone but Michael.<eos> Oh, the heart of it.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> LATIN LOVER Which brings us to a time-honored telenovela tradition.<eos> This is a waste of time, Rafael.<eos> I took three home pregnancy tests.<eos> The ill-timed phone call.
Where were you at 10:15 this morning?<eos> I was uptown, walking my cat.<eos> And yet we have proof that you were in the east village, committing a homicide.<eos> Never happened.<eos> My cat hates the east village.<eos> Uh, Captain?<eos> Um, it's Castle.<eos> He's on the phone.<eos> - He says he's got a break in the case.<eos> - What case?

And a new pair of trousers.<eos> Any sign of Liam?<eos> No, but he fled in his rolls, so we've got Vikram monitoring every street cam at every crossing in the city, which means if he tries to get out of Manhattan, we will find him.<eos> Well, I will coordinate with him, start digging into Liam's life, try and figure out where he might go to ground.<eos> You know Liam's gonna ditch the car, right?<eos> I know.<eos> A ride like that would fetch top dollar.<eos> If Liam's bolting, he might want some quick cash.<eos> Who are you calling?<eos> Your husband.
That's definitely not the painting that was in the killer's briefcase.<eos> Maybe Liam was telling the truth?<eos> If he was, it would explain why Justin gave up the painting so easily.<eos> He knew it was a fake.<eos> Which means the real killer is still out there, with the real painting.<eos> Oh, I love it when there's a twist.<eos> And I love it when my belly's full.<eos> I-I'm getting takeout right now.<eos> Restaurant food?<eos> Hell no!
Artoo and I first encountered her and her scruffy band of rebels some years ago now.<eos> We took part in one of their missions.<eos> - Wow!<eos> - Wow, indeed.<eos> Um, you do of course have my card in your little book?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am C-3PO, you little twerp.<eos> And you should know that it was I who played the most significant part in that early rebel mission.<eos> Albeit, quite by accident.
Yet somehow you were recruited into the CIA.<eos> You got my letter there, right?<eos> This thing?<eos> A letter of immunity from the Central Intelligence Agency, signed by Victor Cullen. That's your proof?<eos> Yeah, that's all the proof you need.<eos> You won't tell us anything about your so-called operation, at least tell me this.<eos> Why dismember Cullen's body?<eos> - I was following orders.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Whose?
Welcome to our world.<eos> There is something you're not telling me.<eos> Who he's after, for instance.<eos> I'd like a name.<eos> He didn't give me a name.<eos> Look, if you got a problem, why don't you take it up with Reven Wright?<eos> We got a job to do.<eos> Got her.<eos> First floor, second window from the right.<eos> Same play as the others?
Please hold for senator Grant.<eos> I hope you don't mind the aisle, 'cause I'm a window guy.<eos> The judiciary committee would like to call Olivia Pope to the stand.<eos> Olivia Pope?<eos> Is Ms. Pope in the building?<eos> You changed your mind.<eos> I had a realization.<eos> About my father.<eos> No, not him.<eos> You.
So there are guys from the squad making collars at the precinct as we speak.<eos> As we speak?<eos> I don't even get a heads-up?<eos> This is your heads-up.<eos> And you didn't get this from me.<eos> He thought I was gonna give the heads-up to the cops?<eos> This is between you and him.<eos> Who you calling?<eos> Who do you think?<eos> Your old man?

Good idea.<eos> Leave her out of it.<eos> ...it would look like I'm assuming that she's just following orders...<eos> It could. ...instead of standing up on her own two feet and saying what's on her own mind.<eos> Which you'd want to communicate.<eos> But as importantly, I don't want a single one of our people assuming that I would hold back on my response because she's involved.<eos> That, too.<eos> Let me get a draft started.<eos> I'm sorry about this, boss.<eos> Me, too.
Son, can you get a handle on your cute little partner here?<eos> Sir, she's simply pointing out your moving violation, as is her job.<eos> I didn't break any law.<eos> You rolled through the stop sign.<eos> Reagan, as in Frank?<eos> He's my father, yes, and ADA Erin Reagan's my sister, who works for your nephew, who opened up this particular can of worms this morning.<eos> You got a beef, I suggest you take it up with him.<eos> This is harassment, Officer Reagan.<eos> No, this was a routine traffic stop, sir.<eos> Strictly by the book.
I just didn't want to leave things the way they were.<eos> Okay, I guess then that's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> Good-bye, sir.<eos> Eli?<eos> Ruth.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I've been meaning to call you.<eos> - About?
- Yeah.<eos> I cried like a baby.<eos> I don't like pain.<eos> When are you hiring?<eos> - Immediately.<eos> I'll know in an hour.<eos> - Oh, good. I hope this works out.<eos> Me, too.<eos> It was nice to meet you, Jason.<eos> You, too.
It's not about being great or funny.<eos> It's... It's about who's better.<eos> He's better.<eos> Oh.<eos> - Jason Crouse. - Jason, it's Alicia Florrick.<eos> Wow, that was fast.<eos> What do you need?<eos> I just wanted to thank you for coming in.<eos> But, um, I'm sorry. I think I'm going in a different direction.<eos> Me, too.

When he does well, I want you to congratulate him; when you do well, I want him to congratulate you.<eos> Give him a call.<eos> Willingly.<eos> Good.<eos> $32,000.<eos> That's not bad for a week's worth.<eos> $16,000.<eos> I split it fifty-fifty with Lucca.<eos> So let's see, $400 to Amanda,<eos> $160 to Jason,

This image was taken by one of our probe droids.<eos> It clearly shows you harboring known rebels.<eos> Now surrender them or be destroyed.<eos> If it's a fight you want, I hope you brought a better class of soldier than those stormtroopers.<eos> They serve the Empire well, and I have a great many of them.<eos> You're gonna need all of 'em.<eos> I like these guys.<eos> They found us.<eos> Guess that search pattern paid off.<eos> Battle stations.
Yet?<eos> I still don't get it.<eos> I told you, once a year, a lucky chorister gets to play Bishop.<eos> I get to wear the mitre and hold a staff and everything.<eos> Oh, that explains why you practise holding your staff every night!<eos> Can I go now please, Angela?<eos> I forgot to ask.<eos> I'm having a party at my house tomorrow night and I need someone to hand out drinks and nibbles.<eos> Would you two be up for that?<eos> 25 quid in it for you each?
Yeah, there was.<eos> I could erm...<eos> I could feel his touch...<eos> It was...<eos> It was inside me.<eos> Mm. Oh, yeah, you told me the nurse had said much the same.<eos> Hey...<eos> Sitting there, holding his hand whilst he slipped away, what did you feel?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Er, sick.
Well I have someone. Dr. Gould.<eos> He has treated patients with atrophic relation.<eos> Are you Googling again?<eos> No.<eos> My dad went to him for sleep apnea.<eos> Your dad?<eos> You told loud mouth Leo?<eos> I thought we were keeping this under the radar.<eos> Who's he gonna tell?<eos> His dart league?
A compliance officer.<eos> She makes sure that renovations adhere with the Americans with Disabilities Act.<eos> A lot of properties here.<eos> I'm not sure that means much to us.<eos> What is these or one of these, any of these, were a high-value target?<eos> Blueprints would be hard to come by, but Cecilia has access to them.<eos> Could be our killer was after these.<eos> And Matthew Burke was collateral damage.<eos> Cecilia has them with her all the time.<eos> Except Thursdays.
We can't be partners and whatever else we are.<eos> Is this about us protecting our jobs?<eos> Or are you are feeling the pressure of taking this to the next level?<eos> I'm glad people found out.<eos> As a matter of fact, I want to tell the world about you.<eos> Hell, I'd settle for bringing you into my neighborhood and makin' 'em jealous.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Damn right, "Wow."<eos> Hmm. Well, how about you start by taking me to your apartment, and making the cab driver jealous?<eos> Back to you.
I promise you.<eos> At least no one in the audience.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, there's a change in the program.<eos> Tonight's performance will be conducted by our very own Maestro, Rodrigo DeSouza.<eos> Maestro, I know.<eos> We got this. We got this.<eos> Shit, shit, shit.<eos> Sorry, sorry. Sorry.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Hey, guys... no, you, you guys.

Are you comfortable?<eos> Perfect.<eos> Just like when I was a kid.<eos> I'm gonna need a few samples of your blood to run some tests.<eos> I'm all yours.<eos> This should be interesting.<eos> What's the deal with the crew?<eos> Their eyes?<eos> It's a side effect from one of the early vaccines given to everyone on Zona.<eos> But not you?
Barely finished their lunch.<eos> Why did they lie about seeing Newton?<eos> Maybe we should go pick them up?<eos> GIBBS:<eos> No, no.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Newton knew something.<eos> He took her knife for a reason.<eos> Why?
He'll breeze through the senate.<eos> My team at CyberCom has come up with three possible retaliatory strikes against the Russian Federation, which we've designated Phases X, Y and Z.<eos> X is our least aggressive option.<eos> We target the Ostrov administration itself, initiating DNS attacks against government Web sites.<eos> Phase Y:<eos> we expand that attack to military infrastructure.<eos> Deactivate satellites and interrupt communications networks.<eos> That alone should give them serious thoughts about attacking our interests in Ukraine.<eos> And Phase Z?<eos> The kitchen sink.
And you can't let them fire you for cause.<eos> So what do I do?<eos> Work harder.<eos> Bring more money to the firm, and they won't have a rationale to fire you.<eos> Lay the groundwork.<eos> Keep a journal of every incident of ageism you encounter.<eos> With details... who said or did what.<eos> And don't give them cause to fire you.<eos> I have to go to bond court.<eos> Madame.
Damn it.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Don't make the deal.<eos> - What deal?<eos> They weren't selling GHB... it's a synthetic.<eos> It's not on the controlled substances list. So?<eos> They'll say it's an analogue.<eos> It's still illegal.<eos> They'll say it's substantially similar.<eos> Not in chemical structure.
Because you want to steer events.<eos> You don't want events to steer you.<eos> Yes, this is Alicia Florrick.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Hi, it's Howard.<eos> Howard, I can't help you right now.<eos> I just need something fast.<eos> Howard, I don't have the time.<eos> I need Jackie's number.<eos> - You...?
You think I'm ashamed for dealing in fleeting visual sensation, in gift-length glimpses of horror, waste, and degradation?<eos> !<eos> No!<eos> I just caught up with the times.<eos> Reality is the great literature of our era, and I am out there, on the streets, every single night, capturing it!<eos> I am reality's author.<eos> Oh, save your story.<eos> It is not what I came for.<eos> Oh.<eos> So... Straight to business.
Yes?<eos> You know this rabbit?<eos> You found him.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Mike Hooks. He's my boyfriend.<eos> Okay, well, you have any idea why your boyfriend would stab somebody?<eos> Wait. What?<eos> How would Mike know Stan Hinkle?<eos> Who?<eos> The victim.
No, that's okay.<eos> That's okay.<eos> This is all really unexpected.<eos> Yeah, that's one word for it.<eos> Just... I need your help.<eos> All right, you're hunters.<eos> That's what you do, right?<eos> I mean, you help people, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, people.
I promised Dean I'd call.<eos> I promised Lincoln a fun night at the theater.<eos> Things change.<eos> It's now or never.<eos> You felt my presence.<eos> That's why you came here.<eos> You grew up.<eos> Yes.<eos> So this is you now?<eos> At least for today.
Your barbs may amuse your circle of hags, but you have no idea what you're tampering with, what Lucifer is capable of.<eos> Well, dear, if you can't stand the heat, get out of hell.<eos> I must say, it's not as scenic as I'd expected.<eos> We're in the furthest reaches of hell -- limbo -- where I send unruly souls for time-outs.<eos> This is where I meet with Lucifer?<eos> What it lacks in ambience, it makes up for in security.<eos> Makes your flesh crawl, doesn't it, moose?<eos> I get it.<eos> I'm the king of this place.<eos> Still not my cup of tea.
I can't lose you.<eos> I can't.<eos> My mom...<eos> You wouldn't believe me if I told you.<eos> If it's any comfort, I guarantee you I've heard worse.<eos> Well, maybe someday I'll bore you with all the sordid details.<eos> Where's your dad?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He was in and out of prison a lot, and then...<eos> Albuquerque?
You can't be here.<eos> Just tell me what you found out.<eos> I will when there's something to know.<eos> Right now, I'm spending time with my sick wife.<eos> Rebecca's dead.<eos> Maybe she wasn't my wife, but now she's dead.<eos> So I'm sorry, but I can't just wait for you to make time to deal with this.<eos> Please, Nate, just tell me what you know.<eos> Frank made three calls the night Rebecca disappeared.<eos> To who?
- Faster.<eos> - Quinn. Wha... he's going slow.<eos> You're going too slow.<eos> Olivia:<eos> He's fine. Don't worry.<eos> You'll get your sandbox back.<eos> As I was saying, Navid was awarded a full academic scholarship.<eos> There was a time in Bandar before Razani took power where a kid from a poor village could learn English, read the classics, and make something of himself.<eos> Bandar still has the highest literacy rate in the region.<eos> No thanks to Razani.
The lady from Virginia is correct.<eos> ♪♪ Where was I?<eos> Oh! Yes.<eos> $544,000 for the D.O.J.'s premium linkedin account.<eos> We are watching Mellie Grant she is filibustering our planned parenthood in an extraodinary... .<eos> You're B613?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Both: "You can't take command, son!"<eos> He was the closest thing to a father I ever had.<eos> Me too.
Will you shut up?<eos> He's right.<eos> I'll cover you.<eos> Get to the interstate.<eos> I'm gonna double back and head to the car.<eos> The car won't drive!<eos> You go.<eos> You get him to court.<eos> Because if you come back here for me and I'm alive, I will fire your ass.<eos> On my count.
It's Graff.<eos> We need to talk. It's urgent.<eos> Meet me at the Raleigh hotel bar.<eos> I'm heading there right now.<eos> What a mess.<eos> It looks like suicide.<eos> Is that his weapon?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He had just called me to meet him.<eos> About what?
Whatever you want.<eos> Think of it as a discretionary fund.<eos> A token of my... trust in your judgment.<eos> I need you to tell me everything you know about NZT.<eos> The side effects, how to reverse them.<eos> I don't know of any way.<eos> You studied it.<eos> You ran trials.<eos> You gave it to my father.<eos> To other patients.
But I feel great today.<eos> And that's not really how side effects work, right?<eos> So, um, I'm sorry I worried you.<eos> Worried is an understatement.<eos> I went to see Andrew Epperly last night.<eos> Yeah, what happened?<eos> He doesn't know of any antidote.<eos> What about your dad?<eos> He did give my dad NZT.<eos> All of the patients, actually.
A family, kids, everything you always wanted.<eos> I don't see that happening anytime soon.<eos> I found Karakurt.<eos> - Karakurt's willing to confess?<eos> - To all of it...<eos> Killing the C.I.A. agents, the senator, the cabal...<eos> Cooper is gonna call Ressler, and he's gonna get started on a plea deal.<eos> Stack up on me.<eos> We go in hard.<eos> On my count.
I sent it to everyone.<eos> Sent what?<eos> The church bulletin.<eos> I went to attach the video of the youth volleyball game, and...<eos> I've been seeing someone...<eos> a woman... a nice, but... sort of adventurous woman.<eos> But nice and... okay, now you lost me.<eos> I attached the wrong video.<eos> You sent a sex tape?<eos> To my entire congregation.
Should I call upstairs?<eos> What do we have?<eos> Uh, patient came in with a head lac, G.C.S. of 14, loss of consciousness at the scene... can you clear the head C.T.<eos> So we can take him up for an ex-lap?<eos> There's no shift, contusion, or bleed.<eos> It's a mild concussion.<eos> I'll do a quick exam, but he's cleared for surgery.<eos> Is this the pastor who gave his congregation a, uh... special blessing?<eos> Word travels fast.<eos> All around the hospital.
No, no. Of course not.<eos> This is, um, this is allergies.<eos> Allergies?<eos> Can we please pretend that it's allergies?<eos> Maggie, if I did something... no, no.<eos> God, no.<eos> You... you cheated on your wife.<eos> Why should you admit that to your friend?<eos> Who would that help?<eos> Not you, not him.
I know.<eos> It just might end up being the world's slowest amputation, but... can't hurt to try.<eos> But... you told Kamal that he wouldn't...<eos> We lied.<eos> We had to.<eos> Didn't want to get his hopes up again.<eos> He's gonna try?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You lied!<eos> To me!
Well, uh...<eos> Damn it.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Jackson, I'm s...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just...<eos> There's nothing here.<eos> I...
Will there be any Hollywood bigwigs there?<eos> Is anyone from Murphy Brown coming?<eos> It's special because your father and I planned it!<eos> Wait, what?<eos> You two made a haunted house? Yep.<eos> It's in a secret location.<eos> We've been working on it all week.<eos> You might want to wear pants you don't care about 'cause you're gonna be peeing' in 'em!<eos> Scare me enough and I'll pee in your pants.<eos> Deal.
I was hoping you'd come back, now he's gone.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> What about ten years ago?<eos> What did you tell them then?<eos> Enough to send me away from my dad?<eos> To destroy my life.<eos> That's what you did.<eos> I was seven years old.<eos> I'm...<eos> Sorry?
So, my friend, tomorrow, finally, you can watch the best player in the world scoring three goals.<eos> In his job, he's the best.<eos> He's the Cristiano Ronaldo of the agents, no question about that.<eos> Tell me who's the best agent in the world.<eos> Jorge Mendes.<eos> Tell me who's the best player in the world.<eos> Until January.<eos> With Cristiano, in 2003, he had at that time one year left in his contract with Sporting. I was with Juventus, Inter Milan, Milan, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia.<eos> Everybody wanted Cristiano.<eos> Everybody.
Good, good. I like the action.<eos> Former US Marshal Jack Fuller.<eos> Turns out he's been a very bad boy. Using his particular skill-set to forge new identities for criminals trying to evade law enforcement.<eos> Since his retirement, Fuller has gone from relocating witnesses to vanishing fugitives. A very lucrative black market business he's created for himself.<eos> Which is why Ada flagged him for the bet.<eos> Should make for an interesting game. Yes, yes. Even more so now that he knows people are looking for him.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> JOHNSON: Adacullsinformation fromvarious governmentdatabases, includingthe Marshalservice.

- You're wrong.<eos> - Tiffany was gang raped.<eos> Your mother killed herself.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> It's my job to know these things.<eos> About all of you.<eos> She abandoned you and... It's not something that a 12-year-old boy gets over.<eos> Stop.<eos> Now you can't trust anyone anymore.<eos> Definitely not a woman.
Your father was a bad man, Asher.<eos> And honestly, you and a lot of people in this city are better off without him.<eos> You got me all turned around.<eos> Need some help?<eos> No.<eos> I mean...<eos> My brakes are busted, but AAA's coming.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> You too.
And I'm so sorry.<eos> I'll never be able to forgive myself because I lied to all of you, and I lied to the woman that I love.<eos> And I'll take whatever punishment you guys think is fair.<eos> I will.<eos> Because I've been bad.<eos> Nice try, Todd.<eos> And it moves me that you tried to stick up for me like that, but, guys, it was me!<eos> Can it, Tandy.<eos> Guys, who you gonna believe?<eos> Him or me?
I love you, Jackson.<eos> I never stopped.<eos> It's all part of the sting, Nelson.<eos> She's just playing her part.<eos> You two are the worst-kept secret in D.C.<eos> I've waited two years for that.<eos> And, as always, you never disappoint.<eos> Uh, time to book two tickets to Geneva.<eos> Can you leave tonight?<eos> Tonight?
- Oh, I shall adjust, but I do sometimes think that the only soil worth standing on is British soil.<eos> I concur.<eos> But you'll soon see this place as British soil.<eos> It does seem a most genteel environment.<eos> Take a look around, ask some questions.<eos> I believe some of our younger members may be around today.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> It's a grand country, really.<eos> Once you get used to the bloody winters.<eos> - And the colonials.
Don't move!<eos> Oops.<eos> (chuckles)<eos> It's just a training grenade.<eos> It's a dud.<eos> Stand down, everybody.<eos> It was used in a robbery last night, and, uh, I know where.<eos> What do you say, Leon?<eos> Want to solve a murder together?<eos> For old time's sake?
And what kind of example does running away set for them?<eos> Are you too close to this case?<eos> The body was found in Alexandria.<eos> I make a call, I have the case transferred.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> I offer this out of respect to you, Leon.<eos> And everything that you have already given this agency.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What we got, Duck?<eos> In which case?
That's Beef.<eos> He denies any involvement.<eos> Well, clearly he's lying.<eos> VANCE:<eos> Madam Secretary, you're gonna have to trust me.<eos> I'm showing you we're digging in the right hole.<eos> The robbery, the murder, the frame job-- we show they're connected, we solve the case.<eos> Makes your explanation to the Secretary of Defense much easier.<eos> Asking with enough rope to hang yourself with, Director?<eos> Yes, ma'am.
Oh, I don't mind the risk.<eos> No.<eos> I mind you.<eos> 'Cause I'm just a politician?<eos> You said you had nothing to prove.<eos> Damn right.<eos> Well, you're not acting like it.<eos> The job changes, Leon.<eos> We change.<eos> Better or for worse.
- Your material?<eos> - Didn't I tell you?<eos> I'm writing a book.<eos> "Unsolicited advice" by Martha Rodgers.<eos> That's...<eos> That's actually a great idea.<eos> I know.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Oh, and your agent loved it, too.<eos> - My agent?
I'll see what I can find out.<eos> Okay. Oh, uh...<eos> You know, Hayley, I set up the small office on the other side of reception especially for you.<eos> Aw!<eos> I'm good here.<eos> But this is my office.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> I shall call you if I find anything out.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> Uh, Vikram?
So, some rich guy bought the "be part of the show" dance package for our next cruise.<eos> And I promise not to step on anyone's toes.<eos> Are you Mr. Schirmer?<eos> Yeah, I boarded early in hopes of getting a little extra rehearsal time.<eos> Well, I'm not sure how you boarded early, Mr. Schirmer, but we're... please, actually, Mr. Schirmer is my father.<eos> Please call me...<eos> Jermphld...<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> - Dave?<eos> - At your service.
- Perfect.<eos> So let's take it from the opening number.<eos> Opening number.<eos> Excuse me, Bethany?<eos> I...<eos> Oh, good spot.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's take this from the top, people.<eos> We face upstage.<eos> Upstage.
Remarkably, it's just like this one.<eos> Even my students wouldn't dare to possess a five-clawed dragon.<eos> Julia...<eos> Byron Sutton didn't custom order that opium pipe for himself.<eos> He bought it for Professor Lawrence.<eos> His Emperor.<eos> So, Byron Sutton wasn't meant to die that night.<eos> Professor Lawrence was.<eos> We believe the pipe that killed Mr. Sutton was meant to be a gift for you.<eos> For me?
- Aconite.<eos> - Ah, Fu Zi!<eos> Much of it, yes.<eos> Very good for pain.<eos> Have you ever sold it in its raw plant form?<eos> Yes, some.<eos> To Mrs. Lawrence.<eos> Anyone else?<eos> Yes.<eos> White man.
I fix things.<eos> That's-that's my job.<eos> I honestly have no idea how to fix this.<eos> Horse walks into a bar.<eos> Bartender sees him and says,<eos> "Why the long face"?<eos> I tried.<eos> You did too, Dad.<eos> I'm really sorry about what happened.<eos> Me, too.
You have my social-media comments?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, right here.<eos> I just finished this morning.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, that's nice.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> This is all the Twitter comments?<eos> Yeah, and people commenting on your Yelp page starts here.<eos> Okay, nice.
Let's make grocery stores a safe space for all.<eos> Together, we can make a difference.<eos> Because charity shaming hurts everyone.<eos> You know, if there's one thing I really respect, it's plus-sized models who challenge the idea of what makes a woman beautiful.<eos> These ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign for plus-sized lingerie, and we want make sure they're protected from any harassing comments.<eos> Do I have to, sir?<eos> Hey, they're gonna be putting themselves out there, and all I'm asking you to do is go through their social media and delete the two or three comments that are mean.<eos> P.C. Principal, I don't think you quite realize how much negative stuff I have to sift through.<eos> I know it's a lot, but I just really need you to help these plus-sized models. And Vin Diesel.<eos> Vin Diesel, too?
Oh, it was great.<eos> You should have been there.<eos> Ah, they all come back.<eos> Greg, you want your job back, it's yours.<eos> Ah, ah. I forgot how much fun it was here...<eos> I missed that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Um, listen, I really appreciate this, but I don't want to work today, it's Thanksgiving, and I have seniority, I can pick my shifts.<eos> Had seniority.<eos> So sorry.
No, what?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But I'll tell you what it's not... building nightmares.<eos> Your dad also booed our wedding dance.<eos> Greg, she's not old enough for a blanket.<eos> She's here, she's here, she's here, she's fine.<eos> Sorry! Sorry!<eos> It was just a joke.<eos> You think it's funny screwing with the only thing I love?<eos> The only thing?
Mm-hmm.<eos> They said that we'll be able to hear the baby's heartbeat.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> - This is real.<eos> - This is real.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> Hey, Gabby, what you doing here?<eos> - Miss us yet? - Uh...<eos> Some of you.
Kelly was telling me.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Roger Maddox, huh?<eos> You heard of him?<eos> Yeah, sure, he's a big property developer.<eos> Supposed to be a real scumbag.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Uh, got to get to work.<eos> It was nice to meet you.<eos> You, too.
I can make it.<eos> I worry about you.<eos> Well, I'm likely unemployed now, so...<eos> Silver lining, my inner stalker has left the building.<eos> You can invite some girls over tonight.<eos> Play some twister.<eos> See if I care.<eos> These girls I'm inviting over?<eos> I'm warning you, They're basically adult film stars.<eos> And not even the under contract ones.
There he is now!<eos> (lock buzzing, latch clicking)<eos> Mr. James Palmer.<eos> JIMMY:<eos> So sorry I'm late.<eos> I seem to have had a... an allergic reaction to this wool cap.<eos> Do you have a cotton one?<eos> (buzzer sounds, gate clicks)<eos> (man speaks indistinctly over P.A.)<eos> (over P.A.):
They cancel each other out!<eos> Nothing! Maestro, maybe Anna Maria wants to dissolve the marriage because she met someone else.<eos> ♪ No, Michel.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, I missed you all!<eos> - How was the trip.<eos> - Betty.<eos> We brought you this back for a little taste of Mexico.<eos> Who gets the scorpion?<eos> You, of course.

I can breathe.<eos> Ruth's on her way.<eos> I w-want to talk to her first.<eos> Sir, we really need to give your lungs a rest, okay?<eos> No.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I think we can give Casey a few more minutes till his wife gets here.<eos> But you put that mask on.<eos> Deal.
I'm not saying you're not a good doctor.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry for everything.<eos> We started out together, and you just blew right past me.<eos> I started to think that...<eos> Jo, if they don't see what a good surgeon you are, it's not your fault.<eos> It's theirs.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> I miss you.<eos> Me too.
Maybe you should light one of them candles for my boy, Luke.<eos> He's gonna need a miracle tomorrow night.<eos> I don't think it's those kind of candles, Flippa.<eos> Actually, this holiday's about celebrating the... the triumph of faith and courage over might, so...<eos> - it might be a little help.<eos> - The Lord works in mysterious ways, huh?<eos> Well, that's technically a different deity, but your sentiment is correct, Captain Grover.<eos> - Shalom. - Shalom, shalom.<eos> Shalom.<eos> Not for you.
Attention all units in the vicinity of South Park Elementary.<eos> We have a code red. Principal calling for help during school assembly.<eos> All officers needed at once.<eos> The school?
They're so gay.<eos> Butters told me.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - No, dude. In those old, abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse,<eos> And they dress up and play ninja in it, trying to scare people away.<eos> How is that gay?<eos> It's the gayest thing ever, dude!<eos> Ninjas are fucking dumb!<eos> Dude, come on! We got to go see this!<eos> Over this way!
I mean, he is really cute and really smart and really funny, but, oh, he's always wearing clogs.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> If he is not a chef, a nurse, or a tulip salesman, you need to run.<eos> Hey, if your mother had that attitude about a man in clogs, you two wouldn't have a dad.<eos> Okay, thanks, dad.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> Bye.<eos> Guess what, guys.<eos> I am going to be the big boss at work tomorrow, and coincidentally, it's take your daughter to work day.<eos> - Huh?
I'm telling you, the man uses too much starch.<eos> What does he think this is, a potato?<eos> For God's sakes.<eos> "You know, Junior, the only thing more important than a stiff drink is a stiff collar."<eos> That guy.<eos> Can't breathe in this.<eos> Tony...<eos> That's better.<eos> ...the case.<eos> The case, yes.
Shelby, this is your confession on Miafina.<eos> Why do you have this?<eos> Whoever attacked you saw your confession.<eos> He was looking for you.<eos> Now I'm looking for him.<eos> I should never have posted that.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> It wasn't stupid.<eos> I thought if I posted it, that it'd make me feel better or... help me to move forward, or to go to the police, to tell someone else.<eos> Anyone else.
They held me down to the pool table, and they pinned my arms back.<eos> I realized my skirt was up.<eos> No!<eos> They took turns raping me.<eos> Help me!<eos> And I tried to tell them to stop.<eos> I tried to fight them off, and... and then I just-just stared at that painting, and I prayed for it to be over.<eos> I'm so sorry that happened to you.<eos> Did you report your assault to anyone?<eos> The university.
To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> Come on.<eos> The Cure?<eos> I don't know why I bother.<eos> The cure won't be ready for a while, yet.<eos> We're going to do this properly this time.<eos> Rigorous testing.<eos> Sorry, Doc.<eos> I promised my friend if he gave us the tainted Utopium recipe, he'd get the cure, tout de suite.<eos> For your friend?
I don't want to.<eos> You're not that nice to me and you're weird.<eos> And I tell myself to stop thinking about you, but every time you show up, it's like boom, feelings.<eos> And I know also that you have feelings for Josh...<eos> - No, I don't have feelings...<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - No, I-I don't, I don't have feelings...<eos> - No, no, shh.<eos> - Just listen. Just-just listen.<eos> - for Josh?
Where are all the customers?<eos> I haven't seen this few people since...<eos> You went on Tinder?<eos> Your sweet 16 party?<eos> Caroline, throw one in there.<eos> Your season of "The Bachelor"?<eos> I was going to say so few people since a sale at your cupcake window. Boom!<eos> I just schooled you.<eos> Well, preschooled us.<eos> Hey, everybody.
And here's your scarf.<eos> Oh, Mr. Landau, hello.<eos> - Ruth.<eos> - Frank.<eos> So glad you could do this for us.<eos> Well, I'm honored to be a part of it.<eos> Just sorry we couldn't get the Obama location - in the Old Capitol building.<eos> - As am I.<eos> But, uh, here we have the common touch.<eos> Yes, and the common smell.
Hey.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Where's your detail?<eos> Um, I snuck out.<eos> All right, that is crazy.<eos> Their job is to be with you the whole time, to look after you when you get home.<eos> I just needed to see you.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I just, um...
You know what?<eos> No, I-I refuse to be one of those germophobic, new, high-strung parents.<eos> Like, why?<eos> For why?<eos> - Okay.<eos> I don't want to do it.<eos> - You know?<eos> - So lame. No.<eos> - Who wants to be that guy?<eos> - Not me.
No, I-I refuse to be one of those germophobic, new, high-strung parents.<eos> Like, why?<eos> For why?<eos> - Okay.<eos> I don't want to do it.<eos> - You know?<eos> - So lame. No.<eos> - Who wants to be that guy?<eos> - Not me.<eos> Cool parents.
A hacker collective asked me to perform a few Masonic chants for their amusement.<eos> Perhaps it's best I don't hear the full explanation.<eos> Well, it was a small price to pay for their help.<eos> We just recovered an original printing of The First Book of Urizen.<eos> Oh, the prophecies of William Blake.<eos> Stolen by a hammer-thumbed dry cleaner.<eos> As I predicted.<eos> Watson is at this moment obtaining a confession at the station.<eos> Why haven't you answered my calls?<eos> Aside from force of habit?
I didn't need Ethan dead; I was kicking his ass.<eos> Mr. Parris was fleecing you on concrete and overages.<eos> No, no. Because...<eos> The longer you play dumb, Mr. Pruitt, the less likely we are to help you.<eos> I can prove nobody here wanted Ethan dead.<eos> I doubt you can prove you tied your own tie this morning.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> You see that, uh, brown tower?<eos> Just to the south there?
Um, Phil, I'm gonna have to pass on your offer to run away with you.<eos> So...<eos> My God.<eos> Whew, that did not go well for you.<eos> You really blew it.<eos> Talk about a face-plant, huh?<eos> - Okay, that's enough.<eos> - Try to take my woman.<eos> Facial!<eos> - Facial express.
Where did you get those?<eos> Seriously, Brian, where did you get those?<eos> Listen, we can absolutely talk about this, all night long if you want to, or we could try to save Mitra from being murdered by pirates.<eos> Fine.<eos> We are gonna talk about this later.<eos> Okay.<eos> We know Mitra is somewhere in the South China Sea.<eos> But since we don't know who's holding her or how to talk to them, it's time to learn some languages.<eos> Like... all the languages in the South China Sea.<eos> __
All right.<eos> __<eos> Loretta!<eos> - Where's Boyle?<eos> - I believe he left, sir.<eos> Uh... I-I...<eos> I'm having a...<eos> One sec, I'll get it.<eos> I've been offered three-quarters of a million dollars for this machine, and you want me to give it away?<eos> To a pirate?
Well, I checked in with him.<eos> Turns out Perry Granger has been sending him letters.<eos> Fan mail, I guess you could call it.<eos> So I bargained with the warden to give Taurus more time in the library.<eos> He showed me the letters.<eos> It wasn't too hard to put it together from there.<eos> The point is, I just want the chance... the chance... to pick my own cases sometimes.<eos> And I think I've earned that.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Epic!
Okay, good.<eos> - Let's move. ‭<eos> - Wait.<eos> - What? - ‭I know a better way.<eos> Is this you pitching another shortcut?<eos> 'Cause the last one didn't work out so good.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where's this shortcut?<eos> Right up there. But we have to cross directly over the falls.<eos> Those falls?
God knows where he's been!<eos> He looks like he gets a lot of sex... a lot!<eos> With whom?<eos> Skanks, perhaps?<eos> I mean, statistically, there was probably a skank or two in there.<eos> He could've brought anything into my house.<eos> God, I feel toxic. I need...<eos> I need to go to the hospital.<eos> I need a battery of tests and a silkwood shower.<eos> No, I-I-I just...
Did you, um, did you get my message?<eos> Busy morning.<eos> Yeah, busy few weeks.<eos> Take it easy, yeah?<eos> Uh, Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Look, I...<eos> I'm not gonna lie.<eos> I'm starting to feel like a bit of a wet blanket.<eos> Our talks have really helped me a lot.<eos> Me, too.
That's very impressive, doctor.<eos> You do know your ortho.<eos> I want to apologize about before.<eos> It's not that I don't respect ortho.<eos> I do.<eos> I'm just, um...<eos> I'm struggling to find my specialty.<eos> I'm struggling in general.<eos> That's not what I hear.<eos> Oh, about me?
Um, would you happen to remember a woman who comes here every year, alone?<eos> Um, puts an angel on the tree with her son's name, Aidan?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You mean Shona.<eos> It was so sad, her losing that sweet little boy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Has she been around?<eos> No, and I wonder if she'll even come - in this awful weather. - Mm.<eos> Her baby must only be a few months old.<eos> Her... her baby?
I shouldn't have wasted your time.<eos> And you also may have noticed that I'm a complete failure as a Secret Santa?<eos> - You didn't get a gift this year. - Hmm.<eos> I wondered who the lucky person was that got me in the draw.<eos> I really am sorry that I ruined your plans.<eos> My dad canceled on me, so my plans were to drink a couple glasses of fumé blanc and watch "Love Actually."<eos> I'm really glad that I came in tonight.<eos> It's no small feat teaching a cardiac surgeon something about heart.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> You, too.
Number 31!<eos> That's me.<eos> Bye, liars and terrible people.<eos> That was ridiculous.<eos> He is ridiculous.<eos> Who just marches up to people and tells them they're terrible?<eos> - I know, right?<eos> - That's insane!<eos> No one has ever said anything like that to me before in my life!<eos> Yeah, me neither.
That is not secure.<eos> You don't know your own husband's birthday.<eos> Well... you don't know everything about me.<eos> Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are<eos> 7-6-2-1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.<eos> Oh, look at us.<eos> Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> Ready for the aquarium?
Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head.<eos> It happens to everybody.<eos> Well, I'm not everybody.<eos> I have an eidetic memory.<eos> I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can't.<eos> Something's wrong with me.<eos> I told you if we were patient, he'd figure it out for himself.<eos> Oh... I was always afraid this day would come.<eos> This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.<eos> Public nudity?
Nine.<eos> And where did you go after then until half past ten?<eos> For a drink.<eos> Where?<eos> Can't remember.<eos> Tell me about this Nancy, Bill.<eos> Pretty, is she?<eos> It's a crying shame, it is.<eos> Sending a young girl to a man like that.<eos> Not a nice man, by all accounts.
I know.<eos> We've been waiting so long for this.<eos> And we've built it up in our heads so much.<eos> Guys, it's just a movie.<eos> That's true.<eos> He's right.<eos> Although, we all remember Jar Jar.<eos> Leonard, I-I'm scared again.<eos> Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.<eos> Me, too.
So I want you guys on the top of your game.<eos> You chopped off my fingers!<eos> So if I may coin a phrase... it's basically<eos> Arm-ageddon out there.<eos> Oh, come on, guys, that's basic.<eos> Arm-ageddon.<eos> - Come on, that's...<eos> - We get it.<eos> - I'll laugh later. Promise. - Mm.<eos> Fortunately,
Noah?<eos> Noah?<eos> Noah? Did you see where he went?<eos> No.<eos> Well, there's Hudson.<eos> Noah?<eos> Stay right there, sweetie.<eos> Noah?<eos> So you say you called her boyfriend?<eos> Peter.
Sounds like your kids have put in a lot of work.<eos> So will you come with us now?<eos> You know, it's just that I have so much more shopping to do.<eos> I have to get something for my nephew.<eos> Oh, Bob could get something for your nephew.<eos> I could?<eos> That would be great. It would?<eos> All right, come on, let's go, Santa.<eos> Wait. What's he into?<eos> Your nephew.
He asked me to come to represent him and to apologize.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - This is very unusual, but knowing Biben, hardly surprising.<eos> - Shall I begin?<eos> "Gloria, sorry I'm not here.<eos> You look great, by the way."<eos> - How would he know that?<eos> - Sensing you would ask that question, he says...<eos> Because you always look great.<eos> - Now down to business.
You once took an oath to never leave a fallen soldier behind.<eos> Now's your chance to make good on that promise.<eos> A deal was my only shot at getting out of here.<eos> I just wanted a fresh start.<eos> That's exactly what this is-- a new beginning.<eos> I know.<eos> Don't let a bad situation define who you are.<eos> Alex should receive the transplant in a few days.<eos> Should be on his feet by the new year.<eos> Thanks to Doogan.

I love your headband.<eos> Shut your mouth.<eos> I love your headband.<eos> We're all wearing the same headband.<eos> ALL: Ha ha! Headband!<eos> Look, Mabel, this whole thing is ridiculous.<eos> But if winning a trial is what it takes to get you to come home with us, then so be it.<eos> I'm sorry, Dipper, but I can only speak through my legal team now.<eos> We have a doctorate degree in hunkiness.<eos> Also criminal and international law.
What did the defendant say when you asked him about the concrete?<eos> That the old floor had been damaged by water from a nearby fire.<eos> We then determined that the fire occurred too far away, and it was impossible for the water to get back to his building.<eos> To obtain his statement, did you or your partner apply any coercion, physical violence, threats?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> After Hector Rodriguez disappeared in 1999, what did the police conclude?<eos> Well, officially, that he had been taken by his father in a custody dispute.<eos> But I disagreed.<eos> So the New York Police Department was wrong, but you were right?<eos> Unfortunately, yes.
If you follow my instructions, you'll have all the brains you need.<eos> I need brains.<eos> Sorry, wow.<eos> I am really rusty at the "Welcome to Team Z" speech.<eos> I should've made pamphlets.<eos> Um...<eos> You need to eat brains in order to stay functioning.<eos> If you don't, your mind goes...<eos> Your flesh decays...<eos> All the... All the tropes.
Oh, show 'em one of your hats, Romes.<eos> The purple one Pippa Middleton wore in "Star" magazine.<eos> Oh! Pippa Middleton, wow.<eos> She was up for a job on "The Today Show,"<eos> but she didn't get it.<eos> Andy, they don't want to see my hats.<eos> Oh, Andy wants us to see your hats.<eos> Let's see your hats.<eos> Oh, this guy was there when no one believed in me, and he supported me in every way, and now I'm in over a hundred department stores worldwide.<eos> Worldwide?
I'm good.<eos> I never would have said anything If i knew this was gonna happen.<eos> You said you weren't going to say anything at all.<eos> I know, and i am sorry, but you lied.<eos> You said agent ressler's laptop was on your work station, And we both know that is not the truth.<eos> The i.P. Address where your search originated -- It was agent ressler's apartment early this morning.<eos> Way early, so...<eos> Aram, i'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me too.
Well, stay up for me after the concert, you can find out.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Really.<eos> Really.<eos> This is nice.<eos> Just being here, laughing, with you.<eos> Yeah it is, isn't it?<eos> Reminds me of before.<eos> I liked before.<eos> Me, too.
Where-where's McGee?<eos> Let's bring the whole gang in here.<eos> Actually, they're... somewhere over the Atlantic about now.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Next flight to South Sudan wasn't for another two days, so they made an executive decision, knowing that you were in good hands.<eos> So you listen to Dr. Taft and let them worry about Burley and...<eos> Jeanne Benoit.<eos> Really?<eos> Wow.
Well, I thought you NCIS agents had all the fancy gadgets.<eos> The money.<eos> This ain't no lead.<eos> You want to go back to your flooded headquarters, feel free.<eos> Well, then again, I might come with you.<eos> Kind of stuffy in here.<eos> I like a more relaxed, personable environs.<eos> Detective?<eos> This came for you.<eos> The case?
Stop.<eos> Sir...!<eos> Enough.<eos> I don't know.<eos> How about that?<eos> Whatever the question is, there's your answer:<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is this absolutely necessary?<eos> I don't trust many people.<eos> And definitely not you.
Uh-huh. You're clear for the next hour.<eos> So, weeks go by and then I get called in on ten minutes' notice?<eos> Don't look at it like that.<eos> Oh, come on, Garrett.<eos> How long do you think you can do this?<eos> I... don't know.<eos> Look, Garrett,<eos> I'm closer to the end than the beginning.<eos> So, some of this stuff, I just don't have it in me to care anymore.<eos> About the job?
This looks like one of those found-footage horror films.<eos> Yeah, except this is real life.<eos> This is footage Dirklin took in the alley on the night that Gallo was murdered.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Um... can you stop what you're doing for a second?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I came to tell you that...<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Ready?<eos> Ready for what?
Detective.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> If you killed my partner, you're a dead man.<eos> Hey! Knock it off, Steadman!<eos> Get your man under control, Lieutenant.<eos> Get him out of here!<eos> Why is it that you bring trouble wherever you go, Deeks?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was born under a bad sign.<eos> Yeah. "Out of Order."
Fern Mason and Elsie Black.<eos> - Our three victims.<eos> According to his notes, she told him that Sally was with Albert Dray - at the time of the murder.<eos> - Doreen was the first statue.<eos> Judas, right?<eos> Judas the Betrayer.<eos> And that's not all.<eos> Fern...<eos> - The Peter statue.<eos> - Yes. Apparently,
- but nevertheless... - Please. Go on, Father.<eos> When I went to hear Sally Brown's final confession, she asked me to give her Bible to a friend of hers.<eos> - Who was this? - One of her girls, I believe.<eos> - Ginny Beasley.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Ginny. - You know her?<eos> - We've spoken with her.<eos> Well, Sally asked me to write an inscription in the Bible.<eos> I remember it quite clearly...<eos> "To my faithful friend.
- Ginny?<eos> Why? - The three women weren't murdered to avenge Albert Dray.<eos> Ginny murdered them to avenge Sally Brown.<eos> She was in front of us the whole time?<eos> Doreen, Fern, and Elsie betrayed Sally Brown.<eos> That's the meaning of The Last Supper.<eos> Sally is Jesus.<eos> She wanted us to figure this out.<eos> Remember the inscription in the Bible that Sally gave to her?<eos> "To my faithful friend... "
- Sir.<eos> Right away.<eos> Make that two.<eos> So.<eos> Toronto's top detective and happily married to a fine and intelligent woman.<eos> And you?<eos> Private detective.<eos> The police have yet to see the light and include women amongst their ranks.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't think that will happen for some time.<eos> Your loss.
We may never know.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> He has a sizable contusion on the back of his head.<eos> He didn't hit himself on the back of the head.<eos> He most certainly didn't.<eos> This wasn't a suicide.<eos> Dobson's been murdered.<eos> For the gold?<eos> Or some other reason?
I care.<eos> Oh. This should be easy.<eos> Get in, destroy the deflector shield generator, get out.<eos> If Vader figures out I'm here, it'll put all of us in danger.<eos> - Oh, man! - Stop worrying.<eos> It'll be great.<eos> Oh, man, oh, man.<eos> That's Luke Skywalker.<eos> - We have to warn our leaders!<eos> - To the bikes!
She told us a man named Boden broke down her door and attacked her.<eos> I'd like you to come with me.<eos> Run it by me again, the nature of your relationship with Ms. Holmes.<eos> I told you before, we don't have a relationship.<eos> She rented the apartment next door.<eos> She asked for my assistance.<eos> And you gave it to her, correct?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Kicked her door down?<eos> At her request, yes.
They're three minutes out.<eos> Help!<eos> Help me!<eos> - Be right down.<eos> - Pulse is weak.<eos> If this guy doesn't get air soon, we're gonna lose him.<eos> Capp, Cruz, find a place to dig your heels in.<eos> - I'm anchoring off you two.<eos> - Have you lost your mind?<eos> Chili!
One day, he came to me asking me to provide him 15 extra minutes nightly.<eos> I refused, thought nothing of it.<eos> But then some months later, when I'd finished my autobiography,<eos> This is Where the Magic Happens, $29.95,<eos> I asked Syd to provide a pithy quote for the back cover and he did not have pleasant things to say.<eos> Do you remember what he said?<eos> Let's just say the quote wasn't usable.<eos> You expect me to use this?<eos> "For those of you who enjoy watching" "the carcass of old school magic decay," "this book's for you."<eos> Madam?
You got it baby!<eos> I haven't seen him this excited since NBC announced they're doing the live musical version of "The Wiz"<eos> You know, they still haven't cast the cowardly lion?<eos> All black cast, someone with live TV experience, I wonder who they could get?<eos> [Mouths "Call me"]<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> They're coming!<eos> Stations!
I love her, Noah.<eos> I always have.<eos> I know I shouldn't have done it, but I thought, when you left, I thought maybe this was what was supposed to happen all along.<eos> Maybe all these years of being your third wheel were leading to this, to my chance.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> What, so this... our whole friendship has been about some kind of competition with you playing the long game?<eos> No.<eos> What, waiting in the wings till I show a moment of weakness?<eos> A moment of weakness?
This is not ex parte, but we need to talk.<eos> Whenever you want, Your Honor.<eos> Now.<eos> Diane, what are you doing here?<eos> Your Honor?<eos> Please, stop with the "Your Honor."<eos> This is just "Ben."<eos> You really think your client is a whistle-blower?<eos> She was reporting a public fraud.<eos> To whom?
One of our lawyers is actually dealing with horses.<eos> I know.<eos> Good help these days.<eos> So, yes, I actually do think - we can squeeze in a meeting tomorrow.<eos> - Ms. Groom, did the 8th Street Clinic - perform an abortion on you? - Objection.<eos> What is the relevance of this witness?<eos> - I was wondering that myself.<eos> - Ms. Groom is a private citizen who believes she has been defrauded and is now reporting it.<eos> Here.<eos> To this court.
OK, reel it in, reel it in.<eos> I'm not coming in, I'm going to the pub.<eos> I'll be back later.<eos> May?<eos> May, can I have a word?<eos> Now?<eos> I've just buried my boy.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just...
Homeless.<eos> He broke his neck falling off a bench.<eos> And what about the other bodies?<eos> Not mine.<eos> No, no, someone else is out there doing sea-burials on the cheap, but your Coroner, she's on to that.<eos> WHISPERS: I wouldn't mess with her if I was you.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Hey, wait!<eos> It's DS Higgins.<eos> All units.
THEY WHISPER Looks like we've replaced Punch Judy with The Sooty Show.<eos> No.<eos> She didn't pay me.<eos> Oh...<eos> A witness in the next room said they heard a woman yelling.<eos> Would you care to comment?<eos> In the heat of the moment,<eos> Una tended to get quite vocal...if you catch my drift.<eos> And at...6:55, when you left the room... ..how did Ms Drake seem?<eos> Just happy.
You think every married man is on a short leash.<eos> That marriage was well dodgy.<eos> You want my advice, start looking there.<eos> I know how to do my job, Mick.<eos> PHONE RINGS Excuse me.<eos> Jane Kennedy.<eos> Yes, I did get the report.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hold on one second.<eos> Ma'am.
I saw a ghost once.<eos> Seriously, it properly freaked me out.<eos> It came into my hotel room, groaned and then wandered off again.<eos> I would've left there and then, but I was a bit worse for wear.<eos> Scientific proof.<eos> I take it all back(! )<eos> No chance it was just another guest who got the wrong room, no?<eos> So we're looking for witnesses and I'll check out the other treasure hunters, see if they know anything about Errol's movements last night.<eos> But I'm pretty certain it was natural causes.<eos> Natural causes?
Do we need the Cone of Silence?<eos> Alicia and Jason Crouse.<eos> I have no idea what that means.<eos> Jason Crouse. Alicia's investigator.<eos> - I know who he is...<eos> - Are they having an affair?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> - No. - He came by the apartment while I was filming Alicia's Internet ads and she touched him.<eos> Touched him where?<eos> His arm.
The grieving is great.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I need a moment.<eos> I can't believe I almost slept with that guy. Yeah. Hey, wait a second.<eos> You're wearing panty hose.<eos> Is that because your mom is coming?<eos> Well, I just don't want her to complain and kvetch about how I'm not wearing panty hose. - And I just...<eos> I just want to shut it down.<eos> Also, again, I'm not trying to please her.<eos> Or anyone. - Sure.
This wonderful time.<eos> I know.<eos> But, you know, I'm finished working with Calvin, and I just... I hope we're not holding him up. Oh.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I need to take this, ladies. Uh, hello.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mmm...<eos> I think it's time to go. - Agreed.<eos> - Not us.<eos> You.
I know.<eos> But, you know, I'm finished working with Calvin, and I just... I hope we're not holding him up. Oh.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I need to take this, ladies. Uh, hello.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mmm...<eos> I think it's time to go. - Agreed.<eos> - Not us.<eos> You.<eos> Honey...
Another shower cap?<eos> What is fate trying to tell us?<eos> I love how, like, artsy and European it is, you know?<eos> Like, they don't just go for the happy ending.<eos> Mm, so true.<eos> According to this, I've had, like, eight strokes.<eos> - Mm. - Short?<eos> Jennifer Short?<eos> I'm having such a good time, I hate to go.<eos> Yeah, me, too.

Yep.<eos> It's holding a wreath.<eos> Is there a symbol in the wreath?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need to get hold of Terry.<eos> Emergency meeting.<eos> Second thoughts, Mike.<eos> We'll leave it here, in case he comes back for it.<eos> Turns out we're not thirsty.<eos> Neither of us.
He...'<eos> He couldn't cope.<eos> So he tested the knife on his hands, just enough to draw blood, to see if he could go through with it.<eos> 'Then he stabbed the chair to check the knife was sharp enough.<eos> 'Practice marks.<eos> 'And then... '..then he did it.'<eos> He killed himself.<eos> If he'd committed suicide, don't you think we'd have told you?<eos> Not if you wanted the payout from the policy.<eos> What policy?
Been up for hours.<eos> She said you offended her.<eos> What?<eos> Give me two seconds.<eos> Beth, when did I offend her?<eos> Beth?<eos> When?<eos> Hiya!<eos> Where you off to?<eos> Shopping.
So he meant for her to have an accident.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, and his alibi's fallen through.<eos> Mate hasn't seen him in years.<eos> So I'm going to go and arrest him now.<eos> I...<eos> Like I said, courtesy visit.<eos> I need to see Christine.<eos> I am really sorry.<eos> Me too.
I've got to go.<eos> Davey.<eos> He's busy.<eos> I need to speak to Davey.<eos> Why?<eos> Andrew Talbot.<eos> He is a gardener, but there is a specific thing he grows.<eos> Weed.<eos> The night his dad died, he was dealing.<eos> To professionals.
It is too difficult to wait.<eos> Did they tell you when the postmortem would be?<eos> No.<eos> You have to stop looking at your shoes.<eos> OK, sorry.<eos> I mean, they're very nice.<eos> And now spin it.<eos> OK, you ready for a spin?<eos> What?<eos> For a spin, yeah?
Morning.<eos> You on your own?<eos> Yes, Mother.<eos> What happened to Mel?<eos> Nothing!<eos> Oh, come on, how many chances are you going to get?<eos> The coast was clear, Beth's away for a week.<eos> Lucky escape, if you ask me.<eos> No, actually, he's a good catch.<eos> No, not for her, for him.
I know a lot of women.<eos> Maybe I forgot.<eos> Or maybe you lied.<eos> My wife, er...she's a jealous woman.<eos> It's better for her not to see this.<eos> I don't think you understand how serious this is.<eos> It's not serious.<eos> We were lovers, yes, but a long time ago.<eos> You won't tell her?<eos> My wife.
I liked that.<eos> You also liked his plan to "KSR" Lucy Van Gaal.<eos> I did.<eos> I still do.<eos> It wasn't just a fantasy for you?<eos> I was all set to go through with it.<eos> So was TheAlgea.<eos> - Objection!<eos> - Speculation!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. One at a time.
-[officer 1] OK, is he in custody?<eos> -[officer 2] Negative, nothing yet.<eos> [female reporter] They blocked off about a four-mile stretch of the highway that surrounds the Steven Avery home.<eos> And earlier, hazmat vehicles also arrived on the scene, as well as the Great Lakes K-9 Search and Rescue.<eos> [Jodi] It's just bullshit that they can go and search our house and nobody there.<eos> [Steven] Well, yeah, they got the whole yard tore apart.<eos> -[Jodi] Do they?<eos> -[Steven] Yeah, the whole shit.<eos> -[Jodi] I'm scared.<eos> -[Steven] Yeah, me too.
There is only one victim in this matter and that is Teresa Halbach.<eos> She is the individual who lost her life.<eos> And that is the one and only victim in this matter.<eos> [Kratz] It- - I'll comment further. I don't have a problem with this.<eos> I've heard many reports and have seen images of a specific suspect in this case, now Mr. Avery, on the various media, suggesting that, "Why are they looking at me?"<eos> "Why would I be asked questions about Teresa's death and disappearance?"<eos> I hope with the DNA positive analysis and the other surrounding circumstances that that question doesn't have to be asked anymore.<eos> [Wiegert] I know you're scared, Steve.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> -I'm not scared.
Just make sure he stays hydrated and that he uses lots of sun block 'cause he's worried his...<eos> No, no, no, this isn't happening.<eos> I need time to practice, and plus I am a young woman who is single going on tour for the first time.<eos> I should be trashing hotel rooms and, like, sleeping with hot Latin dudes.<eos> Rodrigo is a Latin dude.<eos> Plus, you're the only one he trusts.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Attention, passengers, we'll be landing shortly in Mexico City.<eos> For those of you visiting, have a wonderful stay.<eos> For everyone else, bienvenido a casa.
Tough upbringing doesn't make a career criminal.<eos> Now, we got 24 hours until Danny's brought before a magistrate.<eos> Let's stay focused on what we do know.<eos> All right, we're looking for a crew of four in these burglaries.<eos> Even if Danny is one of 'em... - Still three out there. - Find 'em, we'll get to the truth.<eos> Triple P got some of his own truth to drop on y'all.<eos> I dumped Danny's phone records.<eos> You'll never guess who he called on the day of the break-in.<eos> Residence of none other than Master-at-Arms First Class<eos> Daryl Brown.
No.<eos> Go talk to him.<eos> Might want to take one of these.<eos> Worked up a sketch with Ducky's input.<eos> DUCKY:<eos> It's an excellent likeness.<eos> Put out a BOLO.<eos> On it.<eos> Jake called.<eos> You?
Yeah. Bicycle, car, even the house.<eos> That's what the tent's for.<eos> (chuckles) The ladies must love that.<eos> WOMAN:<eos> Hi.<eos> (dogs barking, howling in distance)<eos> Two weeks a month covers my mortgage.<eos> Who needs to work?<eos> (chuckles)<eos> Uh, us, actually.
Pawnalicious!<eos> How can I help you boys?<eos> Well, you can start by turning that thing off.<eos> Uh, sorry, we're, uh... we're filming a show.<eos> We have almost 500 hits on YouTube.<eos> Gonna go viral.<eos> Okeydokey then.<eos> Uh... this guy ever come in here?<eos> MAN:<eos> Yeah, uh, Rufus something.
(gun cocks) Okay.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> We should call the cell.<eos> No.<eos> Try to negotiate.<eos> No, there's too many ways this can go wrong.<eos> What choice do we have?<eos> TONY:<eos> Shh!<eos> Everyone quiet.
And then I asked him if it was about the Steven thing.<eos> And then he just shrugged his shoulders and I was like--<eos> And then I was like, "You know you can talk to me," and then I just went back inside my room.<eos> Tell us about the conversation you had with Brendan regarding Steven.<eos> We didn't have a conversation about it.<eos> Didn't you tell your counselors at school about a conversation you had with Brendan?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -All right.<eos> And you told Officers Wiegert and Fassbender about that conversation as well, right?<eos> These two guys right here?
- So you gonna do that? - Yeah.<eos> - When you gonna do that?<eos> - Tonight.<eos> Probably be a good idea, before we tell her.<eos> At the time that you had suggested to Brendan that he call his mother, you knew that calls from the jail were recorded, didn't you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - OK.<eos> And you wanted Brendan to call his mother and to repeat what he had told you.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - Yes, for several different reasons.
She's trying on clothes with her tailor and she wants your opinion.<eos> But she doesn't take my advice!<eos> She doesn't take it!<eos> All right, I'm going.<eos> Oh, Victoire. Tonight you're taking Mr. Maxime to Stanislas High School.<eos> Me, sir?<eos> Oh! I'd love to!<eos> I didn't ask if you'd love to. I said, "You will take him." What time?<eos> - I have to be back at 9 pm.<eos> - 9 pm.
Yes. It's much too big.<eos> You must have cut it.<eos> I want Moulineau to make my things!<eos> You have to recut it.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes, you.<eos> Now! I'm in a hurry.<eos> - I have to cut it? - Yes!<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Me?
I've never heard that before.<eos> "It is frequent to distinguish love from benevolence "and concupiscence.<eos> "The passions of a man for his mistress "and a father for his children "are in themselves very different."<eos> - That feels nice.<eos> - Oh, baby, baby, baby!<eos> Please, miss.<eos> Scratch, but don't talk.<eos> Yes, Mr. Maxime.<eos> Has anyone ever told you you're a handsome young man?<eos> Me?
If Mr. Pinglet ever dared...<eos> Me?<eos> Oh, it wouldn't last long!<eos> - What would you do?<eos> - Me?<eos> I'd take a lover.<eos> Angélique, you wouldn't!<eos> Yes, I would!<eos> I'd love to see that.<eos> Madam!
Perfect.<eos> You're not eating here?<eos> Where are you eating?<eos> At my sister's.<eos> She's not feeling better.<eos> If I don't come home, that means she's worse.<eos> - I'll spend the night with her.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Victoire, you'll only need to make dinner for my husband.<eos> - Very well, madam.
Madam, a man is here to see Mr. and Mrs. Pinglet.<eos> - A man?<eos> Who? - Here's his card.<eos> "Mr. Mathieu." Benoît, it's our friend Mathieu!<eos> Mathieu?<eos> Did he leave Valenciennes?<eos> - Victoire, show him up.<eos> - Very well, sir.<eos> Clean up these papers first.<eos> Yes, madam.
Mathieu?<eos> Did he leave Valenciennes?<eos> - Victoire, show him up.<eos> - Very well, sir.<eos> Clean up these papers first.<eos> Yes, madam.<eos> Oh, what are these?<eos> Hotel brochures!<eos> - Hurry up, Victoire!<eos> - Yes, madam.
This is insane!<eos> Mathieu, you're too much.<eos> What could he have for us in all these trunks?<eos> It must be big, because it took 4 trunks.<eos> Pinglet, I don't have... change.<eos> Could... you... give fo... fo... four francs to these de...de... Livery men?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> De... de...<eos> Livery men!
Thank you, sir.<eos> Thank you, madam.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Thank you, madam.<eos> Let's just forget it.<eos> Angélique, go to the kitchen and see if the delivery men are still there and ask them to take away these trunks.<eos> I'm going.<eos> What are all these trunks for?<eos> I was just about to ask for them to be brought down.<eos> Oh, madam.
Oh! A naked woman.<eos> Oh, if that's all it was, that's nothing.<eos> Mr. Bastien, she was naked!<eos> Stark naked!<eos> Yes, I get it.<eos> OK! She said, "Young man, bring me some playing cards."<eos> Like that.<eos> What would you have done?<eos> "Like that," I would've brought her the playing cards.<eos> What, naked?
Must I, sir?<eos> Ernest!<eos> The Handsome Ernest!<eos> Everyone knows me.<eos> The leading actor in Montmartre, Batignolles and Belleville.<eos> You're the Handsome Ernest?<eos> Sir, there are lots of beautiful women here who say wonderful things about you!<eos> Did you hear that, madam?<eos> She's a duchess.<eos> Oh, madam! Madam!
What a night!<eos> What are you doing there?<eos> I heard a noise.<eos> I thought you had called.<eos> I need a balcony, a terrace, somewhere I can get some air.<eos> - I see.<eos> Upstairs on the right.<eos> - OK, OK...<eos> And bring a hot water bottle for the gentleman.<eos> - Very well, madam.
But everything's closed.<eos> Oh, I know!<eos> We kicked out a crazy lady. She took tea every night.<eos> Her things must be in her room. I'll be right back!<eos> What a night!<eos> Here it is!<eos> I knew I'd find all her things.<eos> Oh, yes! That's perfect!<eos> Hang on. Here. Put it there.<eos> Yes, madam.
- You sound like a lawyer again.<eos> True.<eos> Well, it's late.<eos> We'll stay the night, but... There's no need to have our trunks brought up.<eos> We'll go somewhere else tomorrow.<eos> - Go get the hot water bottle.<eos> - Yes, madam.<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> I'd prefer a fancy hotel!<eos> Me too!
- No!<eos> Don't make so much noise. Daddy told us not to.<eos> It'll be so nice to climb into these sheets!<eos> Oh, it's cold!<eos> Before I go to bed, I'll put in my curling papers.<eos> Yes!<eos> Let's curl our hair!<eos> What a good idea.<eos> - Pass me the candle.<eos> - Me too.

- You, stay here.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Now for you, madam.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I'm with my husband.<eos> - With your husband.<eos> - Yes.<eos> My husband is the man you just dragged over there.<eos> Yes, madam.
"My wife is cantankerous. Fine!<eos> "Crushingly boring! Fine!<eos> "At least she's faithful."<eos> But she's not even that!<eos> Despite her age.<eos> Not even that!<eos> Not true! I'm telling you, it's not true!<eos> That's why you locked me in!<eos> So you could easily get to your lovebird dinner with Paillardin, my best friend.<eos> Me?
The train is coming soon. Go back to Valenciennes.<eos> Go back to Valenciennes!<eos> To Valenciennes!<eos> But the la... the la...<eos> It's raining.<eos> But it's nice in Valenciennes!<eos> To Valenciennes!<eos> To Valenciennes!<eos> Sir, since this case is dismissed, allow me to return this 5,000 francs... which belongs to you.<eos> To me?
I'll order from Vincenzo's.<eos> And finally replace that scratched Van Morrison.<eos> An hour.<eos> I promise.<eos> Make it snow.<eos> We're finally in the same city after months of being pen pals.<eos> God.<eos> Maybe we can just... blow off the Rothko tomorrow night and go out to dinner.<eos> Well, I already told my parents you were coming.<eos> Your parents.
I was working late and I just crashed in the infirmary.<eos> Don't try and soften me up.<eos> Why don't you let me make it up to you.<eos> Hmm? Tonight. 8:00.<eos> Tonight is Rothko with my parents.<eos> A week ago we were sending each other letters sprayed with sandalwood oil, man.<eos> What happened?<eos> That was a dream.<eos> You moved back home to New York.<eos> To reality.
I'm not gonna make it.<eos> The presses start running in 26 hours.<eos> Why don't you head down to Serendipity and give that gift to Lydia yourself.<eos> - She's gonna be furious.<eos> - Furious, yeah.<eos> I'll deal with the consequences.<eos> - Thank you, Ange.<eos> - You're welcome, Fineas.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Patti!
What do we know, Sam?<eos> Detailed eyewitness account from two sources.<eos> Great.<eos> What did these guys see?<eos> - The guys are gals.<eos> - Who are these gals?<eos> Um, one of theme won't let us use her name.<eos> Wick said that was a no go, so we found another woman who was in the front row, confirmed everything, and agreed to be named.<eos> That's good journalism.<eos> Atta boy.
She's going to take this hard and will certainly go through a prolonged mourning period.<eos> She's gonna need a new twin brother.<eos> I nominate you.<eos> It's a terrible job and she smells horrible.<eos> You'll have to dress like me and grow your hair long,<eos> - so there are perks.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> What did I miss?<eos> I'm just... [sighs] preparing myself.<eos> - For what?
[Fishlegs] "No man shall tread on these shores, lest he become what he has most feared."<eos> That must be Lycanwing Island.<eos> And that, my friend, is why we always listen to Gobber.<eos> Hiccup, this Lycanwing, it could be, well, not a myth.<eos> That island's not far from here.<eos> Why do I get the feeling we're going on a little Hiccup-Fishlegs recon mission?<eos> Okay, Fishlegs, if we do happen to run across a Lycanwing, we need to have a really good plan.<eos> How about, don't get bitten?<eos> - That sounds like a good one to me.<eos> - Yup, me too.
- Wait, did he just say, "House Hofferson?"<eos> - That is unprecedented.<eos> There has never been a union between these two families.<eos> Hoffersons have always disliked Jorgensons and...<eos> Jorgensons have always irritated Hofferson.<eos> Wait, this means Snotlout is gonna be... family? !<eos> What's the problem, "cuz"?<eos> This is just going to bring us... closer.<eos> Welcome to the family, lass.<eos> Now, on to business.
- Ah, I suppose, metaphorically.<eos> I've always hated the use of metaphors.<eos> Now, down to business.<eos> I need your assistance, my dear.<eos> - You do?<eos> Yes.<eos> In exposing this wrongdoer who is in our midst.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Do you have any ideas of who it is?<eos> Unfortunately, yes.
But, if there's a mess, we clean it up.<eos> All of us.<eos> Together.<eos> We can get the "A" Team from Berk, load up whatever weapons we can and go in, dragons blazing!<eos> Can I bring Macey?<eos> She's been begging to come along on a mission.<eos> No!<eos> No, we're not going anywhere.<eos> Nobody is going anywhere.<eos> Not yet anyway.
You can't change that.<eos> My fate is to have a wife who lives with my mother while I sleep here with you all because the British think I'm a raving lunatic.<eos> As do we Indians.<eos> Where did you get your degree?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> - How many do you have?<eos> - None.<eos> - Who else have you shown this to?<eos> - Everyone.<eos> The British.

If he ever makes a mistake, he'll have someone else to blame.<eos> Ramanujan, Bertrand Russell.<eos> - Welcome to our little asylum.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Come along, come along.<eos> Get off the grass!<eos> It's for Fellows only!<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Could you direct me to New Court?<eos> - To Mr. Hardy?
I thought you had finished last week.<eos> I wanted to check on the painting of the backdrop for the storm scene.<eos> And give Gerda some space. Ah.<eos> She's got a shy one?<eos> Well, you know I'm next. Oh...<eos> So I heard.<eos> I won't be shy.<eos> I should imagine not.<eos> She'll need all her colors for me.<eos> Head up.
How was it?<eos> Fine.<eos> I finally managed to get the color for the snow. A bog in Vejle.<eos> I don't know how you can paint the same thing over and over.<eos> I suppose I just haven't finished with it yet. Gerda?<eos> Could you please not speak to Rasmussen about me again?<eos> My work is my business.<eos> - Stay out of it. - Gerda.<eos> I have my period.<eos> Sorry.
What do you think?<eos> Better than I ever manage.<eos> Lili.<eos> I want to sketch you.<eos> Sit.<eos> Come on, Hvap.<eos> Come on, you.<eos> Lean to the side.<eos> Knee over.<eos> Head up.
Do you like it?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's perfect for you.<eos> We're a little short of money at the moment. I know.<eos> But now that I'm back, I can sit for you again.<eos> Well, it worked well before.<eos> Didn't it work?<eos> Come on.<eos> Looks good.<eos> Head up. Up.
It didn't take much to be different in Vejle.<eos> Surely that's why we became friends.<eos> Every morning<eos> I promise myself that I will spend the entire day as Einar.<eos> But there's so little of Einar left.<eos> You think these things because you're exhausted.<eos> Sometimes I think about killing Einar.<eos> But it's only the thought that I'd be killing Lili too that stops me.<eos> You need to see someone.<eos> - A doctor.
Gerda, no.<eos> You helped bring Lili to life, but she was always there.<eos> She was always waiting.<eos> Now she's making you ill.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> The doctors can't help me.<eos> Do you want to try one more?<eos> ...Warnekros, Einar.<eos> My husband.<eos> - Hello.
You are done.<eos> Your degrees and your fancy awards will not save you.<eos> The American public will soon know you for what you are, an evil, abnormal beast.<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> That isn't me, Corrie.<eos> I know.<eos> I know what you sound like.<eos> I've gotten used to a lot.<eos> All the hours wondering after your safety, worried about how you are.<eos> This house.
Leave at 7 and I'll call you.<eos> All right.<eos> It was a pleasure meet you both.<eos> Bye Bye.<eos> - Bye Bye.<eos> - See you.<eos> Do not look like that.<eos> Well, to end it.<eos> I was 23 when you were born.<eos> Y Tu Mama Tambien.
We did not put in the best situation to be great parents.<eos> And I would be a better parent ...<eos> for you two, you know?<eos> And I hope you can learn from my mistakes.<eos> That is, use a condom.<eos> Or ... Garrett ... whatever.<eos> Listen to this song.<eos> Iwantedto be busy<eos> Traditional song lyrics and "country" Traditional old school.<eos> Iwashthedishes,shortgrass

Madura, Mason.<eos> I have not been alone.<eos> Who?<eos> What do you care?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Who cares?<eos> You brought it up.<eos> It makes no sense.<eos> Now you're playing the fool.<eos> Fuck!
- Thank God.<eos> - Give me.<eos> - All for you.<eos> Drink it all.<eos> Do you go out with me tonight?<eos> There are very interesting things there.<eos> I'm going to see a show with my father in Austin.<eos> Some friends playing.<eos> Well, have fun.<eos> Fuck!
Processing it. Accepting it.<eos> The circle of life. Painful, though.<eos> It hurts, right?<eos> No. Not for me.<eos> I got a boy.<eos> But you're in the shithouse.<eos> Thanks.<eos> The view is splendid!<eos> Which mean "who's next?"<eos> Please, Mom?
And she's doing good.<eos> All right. I'm giving Dick another chance.<eos> To do what?<eos> Get rid of his kids?<eos> I'm gonna meet his children. Heh.<eos> You should try saying that without contorting your face so much.<eos> I'm gonna meet his children.<eos> Better.<eos> I'm sorry about Jim.<eos> Me too.
You can let her go.<eos> She will always be right here.<eos> And I will always be here.<eos> I promise you.<eos> By the way Mom loved the Africa trip.<eos> So did I.<eos> I miss her.<eos> Your mother was the greatest.<eos> I mean Lauren.<eos> Me too.
They're also off-limits.<eos> Your history of the du Pont dynasty.<eos> One more thing:<eos> Just between you and me, if you happen to see Mrs. du Pont, just give her her privacy.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Anything else I can get you?<eos> No. No, no, I'm fine.<eos> Well, I think that's it.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> You too.
Walk.<eos> Don't worry, Paddington. - We'll find him.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> Let's look in the encyclopaedia, unless, of course, you'd like to freshen up first.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> You know, use the facilities?<eos> Most people do after a long journey.<eos> Oh. Well, if that's what most people do, then I'd like to do that.<eos> - Top of the stairs.<eos> - Top of the... Ah, stairs.
- You see anything you like?<eos> - I like those over there.<eos> - They're really neat.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Your stuff is cute.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - How much?<eos> - Today's special, $2.<eos> I'll give you $1.<eos> - All right.
You sound insane.<eos> An artist doesn't just announce his masterpiece.<eos> Why not?<eos> Didn't Michelangelo know he was hitting a home run when he was on his back painting the Sistine Chapel?<eos> That took him four years.<eos> But here's the best part.<eos> It's for UNICEF.<eos> UNICEF sponsors the Hall of Education.<eos> We can finally give back to the children of the world.<eos> Hello, everybody
When you lose someone close to you, there's always help available.<eos> We care about you.<eos> Now... there's a lot of very, very helpful information in here about dealing with loss and moving forward.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> - Laine, we're only trying to help you.<eos> - You can't.<eos> I'm not even sure who can.<eos> Trevor.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> All of us.
My mother practiced mediumship.<eos> And if practice makes perfect, let me tell you, she was pretty damn good, depending on your point of view.<eos> She conducted séances, she used spirit boards.<eos> A bit reckless, actually.<eos> Doris loved my mother.<eos> She wanted to help.<eos> She was fascinated by it all.<eos> And when the séances got bigger and my mother really made connections, she needed a vessel.<eos> A vessel to give them a voice.<eos> - Who?
Left in, right twist, click.<eos> Thank you, sir!<eos> You want some help?<eos> Move, move, move!<eos> Chopper crash.<eos> Spinal cord should be okay, but he's got two shattered vertebrae and no feeling in his legs.<eos> Lieutenant Ryan!<eos> Lieutenant Ryan!<eos> Did anyone else make it out alive?<eos> Yeah, two.
I mean, you were wearing a suit and tie the last time you were here.<eos> You watched me from behind the glass in rehab.<eos> What can I do for you, Commander?<eos> You've already done it.<eos> I just want to say thank you for your service.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> John P. Ryan, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> The one who wrote Liquidity Events in Post-Soviet Markets?<eos> Two-thirds of it, yes.
When will you die?<eos> Within a week in a place that looks an awful lot like hell.<eos> As always, the gods are generous with hints, but cheap on specifics.<eos> Cheer up, Hercules.<eos> I've lived, not always well, but long enough.<eos> I'm ready for what's next.<eos> Thracians, halt!<eos> Shield wall!<eos> Form!<eos> Battle positions!
Precisely!<eos> Your sin, Hercules, was that you had no ambition!<eos> I can deal with an ambitious man! He can be bought!<eos> But a man who wants nothing has no price!<eos> Killing you would have turned Athens against me.<eos> I had to ruin your name.<eos> My Wife!<eos> My children!<eos> Well, you have our permission to join them in death.<eos> All of you!
Or my mom, a riot girl who found her calling as a part-time travel agent and a full-time supermom.<eos> These days, she only moshes with Teddy.<eos> Scooch over, dude.<eos> And then there's me.<eos> I thought I knew where I was going.<eos> I thought I had it all mapped out.<eos> Turns out, I had no idea.<eos> Your coffee, maestro.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Me too.
- No, no.<eos> You can't just disappear from my life like that and pop back into it whenever you feel like it.<eos> I know.<eos> It's just, the people in my life have a habit of disappearing on me and when you started making plans...<eos> You're not gonna lose me.<eos> Adam, I love you.<eos> But these last few days have been brutal.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> For me too.
Oh, come on.<eos> I bet you did better than you think.<eos> And if not...<eos> Actually...<eos> Adam, I played better than I have in my entire life.<eos> It was like I was possessed and the music, it just... it poured out of me.<eos> God.<eos> I've never felt anything like that before.<eos> I wish I could've seen that.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Are you all right?<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - My God.<eos> What?<eos> - What was that moment?<eos> - Could I talk about it?<eos> About your brother?<eos> So I'm 11 years old, and Mom's out somewhere and Dad was upstairs, like, fixing the rain gutters on the roof.<eos> And I am downstairs, babysitting Phillip, the eternal baby like always when I suddenly realize that I have gotten my period for the first time.<eos> Anyway, 11, right?
Stop doing a little play about how you have to go and go already.<eos> That's so sweet of you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hey. Judd, can I ask you something?<eos> She doesn't really care that I'm leaving, so why is she busting my balls?<eos> Well, maybe she does care.<eos> I'm an asshole, Judd.<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> Take care.<eos> You too.
I was responding to a hostile situation, James.<eos> I have no shame in that.<eos> You call for backup when there's a hostile situation.<eos> That wasn't calling for backup.<eos> That was a high-pitched scream, and you pushed my sister in the way.<eos> I pushed your sister out of harm's way.<eos> You shined the light at us.<eos> It's different strokes for different folks.<eos> Put the ice pack in his mouth.<eos> No, on his head.
These are the city limits.<eos> Let's just head for the tunnel.<eos> You want me to drive into that weird swirly hole?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Don't brake!<eos> Go! Don't stop! Go!<eos> I can't do this!<eos> That is against the instructions!<eos> Wait, what's your favorite restaurant?<eos> Any chain restaurant.
My child?<eos> is that a threat?<eos> is that a threat?<eos> Moses!<eos> Moses!<eos> Tell everyone... to slaughter a lamb... and mark their doors... and their doorposts tonight... with its blood.<eos> Why?<eos> Pity the lambs if I am wrong.<eos> If I'm right... we will bless them for eternity.<eos> Bennu?

Go on.<eos> I don't know how much to tell her, you know, about you and this, and my mom and stuff.<eos> And?<eos> I don't wanna scare her away, but I don't wanna lie to her either.<eos> I'm thinking that if the subject comes up,<eos> I'll just tell her, but if it doesn't, I'll just leave it be.<eos> You answered your own question, Jerry.<eos> Why are you smiling?<eos> - We're gonna conga tomorrow.<eos> - Conga? Yeah.

Yeah.<eos> Yeah, like at a wedding.<eos> It's gonna be amazing.<eos> Conga?
- Good.<eos> Now you can kill her without all his pathetic yelping.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> I'm gonna... I'm gonna just do this.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - Jerry? - Yeah.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> She wasn't scared last week when she threatened to send you back to the loony bin.<eos> Me too.
- I know, I'm not proud of it.<eos> Why?<eos> How?<eos> Why?<eos> Who?<eos> She looked like a young Debbie Harry.<eos> I was drunk and curious.<eos> I just couldn't resist.<eos> Οh, my gosh.<eos> Well, what... How... Verdict?
O yes, sweetie, what is it?<eos> I'm sorry to have to tell you this.<eos> But I'll be 16 tomorrow.<eos> Oh, yes, quick, put it here.<eos> I'm leaving home.<eos> See here, young lady.<eos> I did not spend 16 years in this miserable hovel with these two imbeciles...<eos> So that you could ruin it on the last day!<eos> We are taking you back to your father without...<eos> My father?
This guy...<eos> look at him.<eos> He's nothing but sweet.<eos> You'll need a crate... makes them feel safe.<eos> I have something you can borrow.<eos> And food and chew toys and stuff.<eos> But I was, I was just passing a garbage can.<eos> I can't...<eos> - I'll just take him back.<eos> - To who?
- Well, I'll be damned.<eos> - Like you fucking weren't already?<eos> What?<eos> Not what you were expecting?<eos> My file?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what you're gonna do?<eos> You got to give me 10.<eos> - Ten grand.<eos> By tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow night is everything we've worked for.<eos> They're ready to love us.<eos> Can you feel my breath?<eos> They're ready to love you, Frank.<eos> Don't throw that away.<eos> Frank, stay with me.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You a little sad?
- Hello!<eos> Oh. Oh, God!<eos> I got you seeing Professor Coreman tomorrow.<eos> You owe me.<eos> That guy is on a fast track to the Nobel.<eos> His happiness book is going through the roof.<eos> I know, I read it.<eos> Somebody gave it to me.<eos> - I liked it.<eos> - Yeah, me too.
Hi, this is Hector.<eos> I think I can go deeper.<eos> Oh, fuck, we left the mic on.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> I think I know where to go.<eos> Courage, Hector, we're right there with you.<eos> This is Hector, who the hell is this?<eos> I wanted to be a mother.<eos> Just...<eos> Just not yours.
One minute to drop!<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - What?<eos> How do I turn the safety off of my weapon?<eos> What?<eos> How do I turn the safety off...?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Thirty seconds to drop!<eos> On my mark!
There' no courage without fear.<eos> Oi, mate!<eos> I think there' something wrong with your suit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There' a dead guy in it.<eos> Watch your back out there sir.<eos> - No one else will.<eos> - No one else will.<eos> Jinx, bitch!<eos> On my mark!
- Oh, no. I'm not gonna run.<eos> - Not a chance.<eos> - Till he can't piss standing up.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant Farell.<eos> What next?<eos> A little, uh, PT?<eos> PT!<eos> Ten minutes!<eos> Left!<eos> Left!
- Not a chance.<eos> - Till he can't piss standing up.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant Farell.<eos> What next?<eos> A little, uh, PT?<eos> PT!<eos> Ten minutes!<eos> Left!<eos> Left!<eos> Left!
And the only means of finding it is in that safe right there.<eos> No matter how many times we have this conversation you refuse to accept that the enemy breaks through to London tomorrow and we lose.<eos> We lose everything.<eos> Let' say for one moment that I can't rationally explain your impressive parlor tricks.<eos> Dr. Carter told me this device requires a live mimic to work. What use is it to you? - That' my concern.<eos> - On the contrary.<eos> According to you, this concerns the whole world.<eos> Well, what would you do if you believed everything I just told you?<eos> I would locate this...<eos> Omega.
Why is everybody shouting?<eos> I'm so embarrassed about last night.<eos> No, no, you don't have to be.<eos> Ugh, I behaved so badly!<eos> Yeah, but bad can be good, too.<eos> Good?<eos> It was awful.<eos> Oh, I feel sick even thinking about it.<eos> About which part?<eos> All of it.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Here, here's some.<eos> This one's still good.<eos> These are okay.<eos> It will not happen again.<eos> It takes a village, no?<eos> An apology would be nice.<eos> I said I was sorry.<eos> No.<eos> From her.
No.<eos> From her.<eos> She's the one causing all the trouble.<eos> You know she doesn't speak.<eos> Or won't.<eos> Not since her father died.<eos> Ugh.<eos> That was over two years ago.<eos> Look, I'll pay you later.<eos> All of you.
What are you talking about?<eos> You think we did this?<eos> Dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is without do-gooder dragon riders... sneaking in to rescue them.<eos> What do-gooder?<eos> There are other dragon riders?<eos> You mean other than your thieving friend from last night?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You may have an ice-spitting dragon on your side... but we still have a quota to fill.<eos> How do you suppose we explain this mess to Drago Bludvist?<eos> Drago what-fist?
Get them into their pens!<eos> Quickly!<eos> Then, let's ride back out there.<eos> We'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him.<eos> No.<eos> We fortify the island.<eos> It's our duty to keep the peace!<eos> Peace is over, Hiccup.<eos> I must prepare you for war.<eos> War?
I promise.<eos> You just have to handle it delicately.<eos> You might want to take this one.<eos> Boy.<eos> Dad... could you put the sword away, please?<eos> I know what you're gonna say, Stoick.<eos> How could I have done this?<eos> Stayed away all of these years?<eos> And why did I not come back to you?<eos> To our son?
I know what you're gonna say, Stoick.<eos> How could I have done this?<eos> Stayed away all of these years?<eos> And why did I not come back to you?<eos> To our son?<eos> What sign did I have that you could change, Stoick?<eos> That anyone on Berk could?<eos> I pleaded so many times to stop the fighting... to find another answer, but did any of you listen?<eos> This is why I never married.<eos> This and one other reason.
Tell him I'm not here.<eos> He's pushing for a tryout and we need to stall, stall, stall. That might be tricky.<eos> Their progress has been... Remarkable.<eos> - Yeah. Yep. Amazing.<eos> By my calendar, we should hold the tryout in three weeks, right?<eos> Uh, Well, you know, to be honest, even given their remarkable progress, they could probably use a little more time.<eos> We could all benefit from more time, Mr. Bernstein, but it wasn't our agreement, was it?<eos> No.<eos> So are you gonna honor our agreement or not?<eos> Absolutely.
And I'm tapped.<eos> I mean, I don't know what else to do, JB.<eos> I do.<eos> Come on.<eos> Keep working the phones.<eos> We just need one.<eos> The rest'll follow.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> Did we get any calls?<eos> No, no, me either.
It was just a tiny hope, but apparently big enough.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You've done all this only so your dad would do something for you for once?<eos> Then I'd rather have none at all.<eos> You're not mad at me any more?<eos> We're friends.<eos> Let's get out of here!<eos> Now we are the Deep-shadows.<eos> You've always seen the children and him.<eos> On the way to the loo.
You can't tell me what to say when I'm speaking for myself.<eos> Bullshit. They all know you're one of us.<eos> It is totally and politically incorrect to call someone gay who does not self-identify as being gay.<eos> I know it's been that way forever, but something different is going on here now.<eos> The mayor, he's a personal friend of yours.<eos> You want him to appoint you a judge.<eos> Do you have a little conflict of interest going on here?<eos> - I told you I sent him a memo.<eos> - When?<eos> - Through channels.
Ned.<eos> - He looks awful<eos> - You this is anything or is it just another shit drug like all the rest?<eos> I think you need to prepare yourself for letting go.<eos> You can't stop fighting for the ones you love.<eos> Haven't you ever had to fight for somebody you love?<eos> Tommy. You gotta start putting yourself out there in a way that everyone else could see what I see.<eos> What kind of a fucked-up love scene is this?<eos> Yes?<eos> Yes, ma'am?
- You this is anything or is it just another shit drug like all the rest?<eos> I think you need to prepare yourself for letting go.<eos> You can't stop fighting for the ones you love.<eos> Haven't you ever had to fight for somebody you love?<eos> Tommy.

If you recall, the bitee does get something out of the process.<eos> - Oh, there's Norrine.<eos> Here. - Hey! Look at you!<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Yeah, good.<eos> Here.<eos> OK.<eos> Rose!<eos> Come and keep a decrepit man company.<eos> Decrepit?
- Please, stop talking.<eos> Whoa, horsey, what do you think you're doing?<eos> Come on, Rose.<eos> A bite while you're going at it is the best.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Oh...<eos> I know that look.<eos> You've done it before.<eos> I would never let a guy degrade me like that.<eos> Not a guy, of course. Lissa.
If I were pluto and someone told me...<eos> "Hey, You're not a planet anymore!"<eos> I'd be really mad.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Keys, Leo.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye, Leo.<eos> Bye, Gabriel.<eos> Well...<eos> Bye to you too, then.
What's happening?<eos> Answer me, Gabriel.<eos> Why are you talking to me like that?<eos> Why are you so mad?<eos> Cause everyone wants to control me and nobody wants me to kiss anybody!<eos> No new calls.<eos> Leo, I'm going to the supermarket.<eos> You want anything?<eos> -I'm going with you, mom.<eos> -Wow...
I don't work from home?<eos> I just sit around all day?<eos> You store up information for a day.<eos> And when you wake up in the morning, it's all gone.<eos> You're back to your early 20s, Chris.<eos> (Christine) And tonight, as I sleep, my mind...<eos> My mind will erase everything that I know, everything that I did today.<eos> And I will wake up tomorrow, like I did this morning, thinking that I have my whole life ahead of me.<eos> God, without this, I would believe anything that he says.<eos> Anything.
That's where your place is.<eos> And you're the best judge of that.<eos> In central park, for instance, some people like to feed nuts to the squirrels.<eos> But if it makes someone happy to feed squirrels to the nuts, who am I to say nuts to the squirrels?<eos> -That is just terrific!<eos> -It's good, right.<eos> Say, could you, could you kiss me again?<eos> Before the 30 grand?<eos> You know, this man, this beautiful person, all he wanted to do was care for me.<eos> For me...
I'm just...<eos> I'm feeling kind of nervous.<eos> You know, I've got this really important audition tomorrow.<eos> What?<eos> So you're auditioning to be a call girl?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I do that on the side, like, just to kind of support my acting.<eos> So you have an audition.<eos> -What's the role?<eos> -A call girl.
Yes, put her on the phone, please!<eos> Arnold?<eos> You better get me the hell out of here and over to my parents' apartment!<eos> And I better get there within the next 20 minutes!<eos> And you better make damn sure that you're out of the apartment before I get there!<eos> And what I suggest you do is get yourself a hotel room, buddy, and order another call girl!<eos> Squirrels to the fucking nuts!<eos> The unicorn, you see, was a kind of symbol of women.<eos> And this comes from a period when women were treated like Chattel.<eos> Like Cattle?

Signore, give the gentleman his arm back or I shall be forced to withhold grooming for a week.<eos> You... You groom him?<eos> Small price to pay to keep him contented.<eos> Isn't that reinforcing his delusion?<eos> Yes.<eos> What, you don't attempt to cure your patients?<eos> Cure them?<eos> To what purpose?<eos> Well, to bring them back to their senses, of course. And make a miserable man out of a perfectly happy horse.<eos> Madame.
Repugnant chap.<eos> Possesses a tremendous fortune.<eos> Not to mention many unnatural appetites.<eos> As one would expect, her hysterical episodes worsened following the engagement, until one night she bit off his ear and gouged out his eye with a comb.<eos> So her husband had her committed.<eos> No, her father.<eos> If it had been up to the Baronet, she'd still be at home in his loving embrace.<eos> In fact, not a week goes by that I don't receive a letter from him threatening me and demanding I declare her cured so she might be remanded into his custody.<eos> So, you refuse?<eos> For her own safety.
See if I care.<eos> Silly old cow.<eos> Millie. I'm tired.<eos> I'm tired of being a nurse.<eos> Can't things go back to the way they were before?<eos> May I try?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, will you try one for me?<eos> He doesn't like the taste of it.<eos> No. Your son, right?
Eliza...<eos> Inexcusable this.<eos> No way to run an asylum.<eos> Dear God.<eos> You realize we've been ringing for over a quarter of an hour.<eos> We need to speak with your superintendent at once on a matter of utmost urgency.<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> We can't speak with him?<eos> Well, why the devil not?
Listen, who set you up with these people?<eos> Where did it come from?<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> Gimme a glimpse here, man.<eos> Who set you up with these people?<eos> When I first started snitching... I realized how often people asked questions they already know the answers to.<eos> They just wanna hear it from another voice.<eos> Like one outside their head.<eos> You better find Shasta Fay.<eos> Shasta Fay.
The longest only went eight weeks.<eos> After 35, it's a shit show. I'm sorry.<eos> You don't have to tell me. No, it's okay.<eos> It's what happened.<eos> I like telling you.<eos> I like how you give Josh a hard time.<eos> I don't think I give him a hard time.<eos> It reminds me of my mom.<eos> How she was with your dad?<eos> No, with my brother.
And you're gonna share it, right?<eos> - Never!<eos> - Fine.<eos> Alright, share.<eos> I'll share.<eos> -50-50.<eos> -50-50?<eos> I've never gotten 50-50 in my life...<eos> - 50-50!<eos> - Deal!
I love it when you throw me shade!<eos> - Here, Lou.<eos> - lt's okay.<eos> She likes me.<eos> Oh, my God, this is so good.<eos> Mr. Stacks would like to take some pictures with you, if that's all right.<eos> - l guess so.<eos> Why?<eos> - People wanna know that you're okay.<eos> - What people?
Vote Stacks for mayor.<eos> Annie!<eos> Annie!<eos> Did you enjoy seeing them?<eos> How was it?<eos> - We're gonna miss you, Annie.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We can finally get those bubbles out of the apartment.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Warm enough?
It is nice, isn't it?<eos> Brahms.<eos> Beverly... this man has come to make you some new glasses.<eos> Don't worry, it's not contagious.<eos> No, no.<eos> My sister... she had it.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Better this way... or this way?<eos> How old was she?<eos> Your sister?
I'm sure Father will have something to say about the matter.<eos> Do you take wine with your meals?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> That's good.<eos> We'll have wine tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Would claret be all right with you?<eos> - Anything.<eos> But, uh, don't you pronounce it...<eos> "claret"?
Abnegation.<eos> And Erudite. And Dauntless.<eos> Dauntless...<eos> Your results were inconclusive.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> No, not impossible. It's just extremely rare.<eos> They call it "Divergent."<eos> You can't tell anyone about this.<eos> Not even your parents.
I don't understand.<eos> Why are Dauntless fighting for Erudite?<eos> They don't know what they're doing.<eos> They're under simulation.<eos> I need to get into Dauntless.<eos> That's a fortress.<eos> It's not gonna happen.<eos> I can get us in there.<eos> Get ready.<eos> What now?
Get ready.<eos> What now?<eos> You're not gonna like it.<eos> There's a net at the bottom.<eos> Don't think, just jump.<eos> Are you good?<eos> Good?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Against the wall.
What now?<eos> You're not gonna like it.<eos> There's a net at the bottom.<eos> Don't think, just jump.<eos> Are you good?<eos> Good?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Against the wall.<eos> Against the wall!
Say it!<eos> Drop your spiritual beliefs.<eos> Our hearts have descended together to dance in the fires of hell for all eternity.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You took a piece of me.<eos> Now it's time to return the favor.<eos> You like that.<eos> God, please, just tell me how the fuck to get out of this!<eos> Please!<eos> Fuck!
We have to help her cross over.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't want to die here.<eos> We'll make it out of here, I promise.<eos> It's good to see you two together again.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe I started all this.<eos> I'm gonna end it.<eos> Where are you going, man?<eos> To hell.
Listen.<eos> We're just killing ourselves.<eos> Look at this shit.<eos> Look at it.<eos> There was no other car.<eos> Sera, listen to me.<eos> I'm so sick and tired of killing ourselves... with guilt.<eos> I can't do it anymore.<eos> I can't watch this happen to you.<eos> Or to me.
"You better hurry up, party's over.<eos> You gotta get a job."<eos> The second thing he would say: "Don't just follow the path, make your own trail."<eos> Ralph Waldo Emerson.<eos> -No.<eos> -What do you mean, no?<eos> Ben told me he made it up.<eos> You really did learn something here.<eos> I wish your uncle could have been here.<eos> Yeah, me too.
There's a real possibility that he was mentally impaired when he hit Blackwell.<eos> If you can corroborate that, I need it in my pocket.<eos> I may need you to testify.<eos> He's getting chemotherapy in a fishing cabin.<eos> I don't think he wants anyone knowing.<eos> And I'm his doctor. I'm bound by his wishes.<eos> Bound by his wishes or his vanity?<eos> When will he be done with the treatments?<eos> That's up to him.<eos> On him?
Your mother insisted that he try.<eos> I suspect he's still doing it for her.<eos> I've been treating him for a year.<eos> His condition is advanced.<eos> Stage 4.<eos> The pain will increase. We'll manage that with morphine.<eos> "Café du Monde."<eos> "The clouds... were ripped like the strip of fire above."<eos> What's a hush puppy?<eos> Good for you.
Her genes could hold the key to mutation itself.<eos> I need more.<eos> That's all they were able to scrape off the pavement in Paris.<eos> More than blood.<eos> I need brain tissue... spinal fluid, bone marrow.<eos> Imagine... Sentinels that could transform, adapt to any target.<eos> If I could just get my hands on her.<eos> This girl could leap the program forward years... decades into the future.<eos> How old is your son now, Major?<eos> Jason?
Back at the house... where you should be.<eos> I need you to come home.<eos> I know what I need to do.<eos> If you kill Trask... you will be creating countless more just like him.<eos> Then I'll kill them, too.<eos> Those are Erik's words, not yours.<eos> The girl I grew up with wasn't capable of killing.<eos> She was good... fair, full of compassion.<eos> I have compassion.<eos> Just not for Trask.
You haven't changed at all, Charles.<eos> Like I said... I know exactly what I have to do.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's in an airport, boarding a plane.<eos> A plane to where?<eos> Washington, D.C.<eos> Guys, there's something I need to show you.<eos> We're going backwards in time.<eos> I set the system I designed... to record any news about Paris over all three networks... and PBS.<eos> All three?

Whatever happens today, I need you to promise me something.<eos> You've looked into my mind and seen a lot of bad... but you've seen the good, too.<eos> The X-Men.<eos> Promise me you'll find us.<eos> Use your power, bring us together.<eos> Guide us.<eos> Lead us.<eos> Storm.<eos> Scott.<eos> Jean.
I think the history I know is a little different.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> It's good to see you, Charles.<eos> It's good to see everyone.<eos> Well...<eos> I had a promise to keep.<eos> You and I have a lot of catching up to do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's the last thing you remember?<eos> Drowning.
Go all-terrain.<eos> Will you marry...<eos> What?<eos> We've lost Engine One!<eos> And Two and Three!<eos> Four!<eos> Switch to emergency power!<eos> Aye-aye, Skipper!<eos> We've got melons!<eos> Dead ahead!
Not while your arm's still strong.<eos> Freedom is Rome's promise.<eos> You trust them to keep that promise?<eos> I trust their law.<eos> There's only one freedom for a gladiator.<eos> When you die in that arena, you die unconquered.<eos> And you spit in the eye of Rome.<eos> Then this is your future.<eos> And you die a slave.<eos> But not me.
Move it!<eos> What's going on?<eos> My Lady?<eos> Don't touch her!<eos> Let her go!<eos> Cassia!<eos> By the patronage of Senator Quintas Attius Corvus, the champion of Rome, Marcus Proculus, hero of the Celtic Rebellion, will now face the new champion of Pompeii, The Celt, in single combat!<eos> All hail to Emperor Titus!<eos> I know you.<eos> Really?
The name... of the animal.<eos> Cat.<eos> Yes, cat.<eos> Can you say "cat"?<eos> Cat.<eos> Cat, cat.<eos> Okay, what about this one?<eos> A snack.<eos> A what?<eos> A snack?
Like what?<eos> This guy.<eos> That's just some guy.<eos> Tomorrow the wallet might be worth R$2000.<eos> You never know.<eos> I don't know if I'm crazy or just too persistent.<eos> You're persistent all right.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Rat's place.<eos> Not Rat!
I need to reply.<eos> If I bring the bible now things could get ugly for us.<eos> Ask them to come back tomorrow. I'll give it to them then.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> He can't help us now.<eos> Come back tomorrow.<eos> Find him.<eos> He will give you the bible.<eos> The bible has a code.<eos> Page, chapter, and verse.
Looks like we're coming out of retirement, homeboy.<eos> We gotta go around back to surprise them.<eos> All right, here's what we're gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna bum-rush in, I'm gonna say my killer line... then you come in and repeat everything I said.<eos> No.<eos> Ready, and...<eos> Yippee-ki-yay, bitches!<eos> Everyone down!<eos> Yippee-ki-yay, bitches...<eos> Everyone...
You and Chang make a great team, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I gotta get this in the right hands right away.<eos> Can you help?<eos> Detective Brolin.<eos> You've heard of him.<eos> He's in charge of the Organized Crime Division.<eos> He's gonna love this.<eos> Might as well go straight to the top.<eos> Straight to the top.
He'll dance them right to sleep!<eos> Tell me, sweetie...<eos> What brought you to Russia?<eos> Want me to show you?<eos> Where is there a telephone?<eos> Here.<eos> No... ls there a public telephone anywhere around here?<eos> I feel like going for a walk to get the blood flowing.<eos> It's 30 degrees below zero outside and the nearest village is 9 kilometers to the north.<eos> To the north.
You look very handsome.<eos> Who does your hair, Slatan?<eos> You're dangerous with scissors, huh?<eos> You know what?<eos> A lot of people have tried to dissuade me from killing myself.<eos> But nobody had ever given me advice about how to do it painlessly.<eos> That's very nice.<eos> Thank you, Slatan.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Sorry!
Do you need some help?<eos> - It looks like it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> It's not easy in a plane.<eos> I'm good with kids.<eos> Yeah, they love me.<eos> Here we go...<eos> That's it...<eos> Here, take him...<eos> Sorry...
If you die, I'll kill you.<eos> You told the police you're my girlfriend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I finally find a good man and look what trouble you get yourself into.<eos> Don't talk now.<eos> It will be okay.<eos> Yes.<eos> Slatan!<eos> Sorry.

Help us start again.<eos> (SNIFFLES)<eos> (SOBBING)<eos> (NAAMEH SIGHS)<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> The Creator, made Adam in His image, and placed the world in his care.<eos> That birthright, was passed down to us.<eos> To my father, then to me, and to my sons,<eos> Shem,<eos> Japheth,
We don't do that anymore.<eos> You want us to do it, then.<eos> I'm more interested in knowing why you haven't done it already?<eos> Please work with us on this one, Gunther.<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> Old habits die hard.<eos> That's what I'm worried about.<eos> I was talking about yours.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> You too.
I've reconsidered your client's position.<eos> My bank is prepared to honor his claim.<eos> Why have you changed your mind?<eos> Perhaps you convinced me.<eos> I thought you'd be pleased.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> Annabel?<eos> We should take care.<eos> All of us.
- Mr. Brue.<eos> - An honor.<eos> You have met my son Jamal?<eos> Yes, and, uh, another at the door, I believe.<eos> Please sit.<eos> Please.<eos> As explained to you, my client's situation in Germany is delicate.<eos> These are the details of his offer.<eos> As you can see, there are specific requests for some money to be sent to Chechnya.<eos> Hospitals and schools.
I wish to speak with Issa alone.<eos> Of course.<eos> Miss Richter?<eos> Please tell me, why you have decided to make this generous gift?<eos> Are you under duress?<eos> No.<eos> Look at me.<eos> It is unclean money, sir.<eos> It belongs to a man who has done great evil.<eos> My father.
There was champagne and caviar and millionaires everywhere.<eos> Garçon!<eos> May I have a cigarette, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You must be awfully good at languages to pick up Greek so quickly.<eos> I had a head start.<eos> My, uh... father made me and my sisters learn different languages since we could practically speak, so every month there'd be a different language.<eos> French and then Italian and Russian.
- I show you. I show you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Yeah, I don't know where I'm going.<eos> Just tell him... - Fifty. - Fifty, yeah.<eos> - Okay, thanks.<eos> - Go inside.<eos> You understand?<eos> I just want to drive around.<eos> Good luck with your wife.
Jesus Christ, not another dance-off.<eos> He likes them.<eos> How about some shots, guys?<eos> Okay, yeah!<eos> Sure!<eos> Cheers.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Another one!
He likes them.<eos> How about some shots, guys?<eos> Okay, yeah!<eos> Sure!<eos> Cheers.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Another one!<eos> Another one!

Oh, aren't you funny.<eos> You try too hard to be the son your father wanted.<eos> So do you.<eos> Kai, stop it.<eos> We do not kill our clansmen.<eos> Kai won't kill.<eos> Just make some blood.<eos> I believe her.<eos> Come on. We should be training.<eos> To arms!

And in it, a great hero named Kevin Bacon, teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing, well...<eos> It's the greatest thing there is.<eos> Who put the sticks up their butts?<eos> - It's just a phrase people use.<eos> The melody is pleasant!<eos> - No!<eos> - What the hell?<eos> I know who you are, Peter Quill!<eos> And I am not some starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your...<eos> Your pelvic sorcery!
Takethemoney, spare our lives.<eos> Canwestopthe clowning and go home?<eos> Why,I 'mjust having some fun.<eos> Since when do we have a real cameraman?<eos> Youbastard!<eos> Please. I begyou.<eos> Don'tworry!<eos> We're just making a film! Down,now!<eos> Let'sgo.<eos> Ta-dah.
Hi, baby.<eos> Good evening, passengers.<eos> There's a mix-up with my reservation.<eos> I was supposed to have a window seat and they put me in an aisle.<eos> Maybe you could move some people around, 'cause I was guaranteed the window seat.<eos> At this time we are inviting passengers with small children, or who require assistance, to board at this time.<eos> Once again, in the boarding area, we are ready to begin our priority boarding Flight 10 to London.<eos> We'll begin general boarding in just a few minutes.<eos> Welcome aboard.<eos> Yes, just through there and down to the left.
You have until 4:00.<eos> Mr. Shaw takes his coffee black.<eos> - Hi there.<eos> How we all doing today?<eos> - Great.<eos> - My name is Jeanette..<eos> - He's just gonna have a cup of coffee.<eos> - Black, please.<eos> - OK.<eos> - And for you?
It's an old folks' home, like a prison for old people.<eos> Horrible place.<eos> I don't know where I'm going.<eos> I've always wanted to go to niagara falls.<eos> Okay.<eos> That was a stop sign.<eos> Yeah, I'm aware of that. I know that.<eos> All right, do you think we could just try to be pleasant?<eos> What do you say?<eos> How 'bout a beer?
I love you.<eos> But I need you to stay here.<eos> I don't want Alexander to be alone.<eos> I'm coming, too.<eos> Son, it's not safe.<eos> But I'm safer with you than I am down here.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Please.<eos> No one gets out of the trucks.<eos> No one.
Ape... not kill... ape.<eos> You are... not ape.<eos> No!<eos> Leave him!<eos> You're not safe here.<eos> They made contact.<eos> Other people are coming.<eos> Soldiers.<eos> You have to leave now.<eos> Everyone.
Make it through today, and by next week you got cash and you are sitting on a beach sipping margaritas with that beautiful girlfriend of yours.<eos> All right?<eos> - I don't even like margaritas.<eos> - Heh. Trust me.<eos> Come on, we're wasting time.<eos> Daryl, just take his damn camera from him.<eos> He's got this.<eos> - Let's get ready for the next system.<eos> - All right.<eos> Another system?
Who are you working for?<eos> Every galaxy I've traveled, all you species are the same.<eos> You all think you're the center of the universe.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Go to the hardware store and you get the list. The whole list.<eos> What, you're going to try and fix him?<eos> He's not a model train set, Cade.<eos> No, that's right.<eos> He's important.<eos> Yeah, but important to who?
He's important.<eos> Yeah, but important to who?<eos> You can't keep an alien locked up in your barn.<eos> What are you gonna do, play with him?<eos> - Will you calm down?<eos> - I'm trying to, but I just got hit in the head with a ten-foot cannon!<eos> If he eats you, I get the GTO.<eos> Not a word to anybody. Do you hear me?<eos> Not a single word.<eos> Nobody.
- Did you press a button?<eos> - Is it gonna blow up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Your thing is beeping now, so you must have hit something.<eos> - Is it gonna blow up?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> A bomb starts beeping, that might signal a problem, you think?<eos> I'm just saying that it's a steady blinking light, which could be a timer of some kind.<eos> Unless it's signaling location.<eos> To who?
- He's a big, big girl.<eos> - Do you see his soft paws?<eos> He's older than both of you guys.<eos> - You're the best, best little baby.<eos> - He loves that.<eos> Bridge made of diamonds.<eos> And then we go to the queen's, um, castle. And then we go to...<eos> Is the queen a nice queen or is she a mean queen?<eos> And then we go over here.<eos> - Yeah? - To the trees. - Mmm-hmm.
You have tits and the Internet.<eos> Cedric, back me up.<eos> Internet, tits.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Desperate times call for desperate measures.<eos> Go get them, tiger, you got this... mwah.<eos> Right?<eos> Nope.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fuck it.
Okay, it's not about what you did wrong, it's just how people sync up. You know, how they fit together.<eos> Mm-hmm, and we didn't sync up well?<eos> Do you think we did?<eos> Well, you know, it's the first time, it's awkward. You don't know what to say, you don't know what you're touching.<eos> It's awkward.<eos> It's not like that changes after the first time.<eos> Well, I mean eventually they learn what you like more, but... You can never talk about it openly 'cause guys are so sensitive.<eos> Suggesting just the tiniest thing and it freaks them out because then they think you've been thinking that every time, and then they get mad that you didn't say something earlier and you didn't say something early<eos> So the only thing that there is to do is train them to recognize different levels of moans without them realizing you're doing it.<eos> In my experience.
I think I'm ready for that kiss now.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You taste like prison.<eos> Is it really snowing again?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Look at 'em, a million tiny, little matchmakers.<eos> Thank you, snowflakes.<eos> So...<eos> Your place or mine?
- Let's go.<eos> See you.<eos> -Good to see you.<eos> Surprisingly helpful.<eos> Any way I can get the watch back?<eos> Fuck out of here, Jane Fonda.<eos> That's a tough one.<eos> And you can't fuck all three, right?<eos> -You cannot.<eos> -Not the game.
-How do I know you really have my boy?<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad, is that you?<eos> Please.<eos> They're crazy.<eos> They told me if you call the police, they'd kill me.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, do whatever they say.<eos> I don't wanna die, Dad.<eos> No police.
- So?<eos> Well, we're moving in.<eos> I can see that, yeah.<eos> Are these dipshits with you?<eos> Yes, they're the men I hired from the moving company.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> "Oh, boy"?<eos> No. "Oh, shit" is more like it.<eos> This fence is 20 years old.<eos> The car's 30.
Sunnyside is pricey.<eos> Not for everyone.<eos> Well, my Sandy gets the best.<eos> I just, I'll just have to figure it out.<eos> I understand that, but you're months behind, and we are not in the credit business, as you know.<eos> - What's that mean?<eos> - We need payment in full and three months in advance.<eos> Got it.<eos> By next week.<eos> - Next week?
OK, Vin.<eos> We don't make a habit now, OK?<eos> It can't happen, I'm shit broke.<eos> You got a nice smile.<eos> You should do it more often.<eos> I'll get the laundry.<eos> There you go.<eos> It's a lot lighter.<eos> She didn't change much this week.<eos> Well... easy on my back.
He drinks too much, smokes.<eos> He gambles, curses, lies and cheats.<eos> And he spends a lot of time with a lady of the night.<eos> - That's what you see at first glance.<eos> - After you.<eos> If you dig deeper, you'll see a man beyond his flaws.<eos> Mr. Vincent MacKenna was born in 1946 in Sheepshead Bay, the son of first-generation Irish immigrants.<eos> Growing up poor on the streets of Brooklyn,<eos> Vincent learned all the things that kids shouldn't need to know:<eos> fighting, cursing and gambling.
- Yes, but won't the investment get it anyway?<eos> Yes, but perhaps I'd like to see your version.<eos> Ok, I'll send it to you.<eos> So my man.<eos> - You did well, cheers. - Gústi, this was not good.<eos> You're screwed up Sigurður. I'm just grateful to have both feet.<eos> Yes, you just need to call your mother.<eos> Hey, you're coming with us to Florida right? - What?<eos> Florida? - He's all in.<eos> - To Florida?
It's the one place I wouldn't mind calling home.<eos> - More than Pittsburgh, really?<eos> - Yeah, more than Pittsburgh.<eos> You know, I kept all our home movies in a box.<eos> How about we make dinner and watch them tonight?<eos> - Yeah, that be awesome.<eos> - Good.<eos> Oh, shoot, I forgot.<eos> I have to go to Karina's tonight.<eos> - Who?
- Hello, René.<eos> How much of the art did you save?<eos> The national collection is safe.<eos> But the private collections, they are all gone.<eos> All the private collectors?<eos> All the private Jewish collectors, by decree, are illegitimate.<eos> Goering used this place to shop.<eos> And take them where?<eos> Germany.<eos> To their homes.
I think we'll just hang around and keep you company.<eos> That's not necessary, Frank.<eos> I think it is.<eos> Fellas?<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I'll be fine right here.<eos> Yeah, what the hell.<eos> Okay, James, that's how it's gonna be.<eos> Well... on the off-chance that this thing blows us sky high... been an honor serving with you all.<eos> - Same here.
No, honestly, you look a little sad.<eos> Am I tall enough to buy you a drink?<eos> Not until you tell me what you do.<eos> Okay, how about this.<eos> Hey, Greg?<eos> Get two shots?<eos> How about we do a shot for a question.<eos> Every time you ask me a question that I answer, do a shot.<eos> - Same, vice versa.<eos> - Game on.
Do you know what you wish?<eos> Are you certain what you wish is what you want?<eos> If you know what you want, then make a wish...<eos> Ask the tree, and you shall have your wish.<eos> Thank you, mother.<eos> On her path to granny's, the little girl suddenly found herself... In a very unusual part of the wood.<eos> WOLF: Good day, young lady.<eos> Good day, mr. Wolf.<eos> - Whither away so hurriedly?<eos> - To my grandmother's.
Tender and fresh, not one lump.<eos> Hello, little girl...<eos> This one's especially lush, delicious... hello, little girl, what's your rush?<eos> The sun won't set for hours, take your time. Mother said, "straight ahead," not to delay or be misled.<eos> But slow, little girl, hark! And hush- the birds are singing sweetly.<eos> You'll miss the birds completely, you're travelling so fleetly.<eos> Grandmother first, then miss plump...<eos> What a delectable couple.<eos> Utter perfection, One brittle, one supple... one moment, my dear... mother said, "come what may, follow the path and never stray."<eos> just so, little girl... any path.
If this is how you behave as a prince, what kind of king will you be?<eos> I was raised to be charming, not sincere.<eos> I think you should go.<eos> Is that what you really wish?<eos> My father's house was a nightmare.<eos> Your house was a dream.<eos> Now I want something in-between.<eos> I shall always love the maiden who ran away.<eos> And I the faraway prince.<eos> Careful, there.
Fathers, mothers, people make mistakes holding to their own, thinking they're alone.<eos> Honor their mistakes.<eos> Fight for their mistakes...<eos> Everybody makes... one another's terrible mistakes.<eos> Witches can be right, giants can be good.<eos> You decide what's right, you decide what's good.<eos> Just remember.<eos> Someone is on your side.<eos> Our side.<eos> Our side.
Swear to God!<eos> London is in danger, John. There's an imminent terrorist attack and I need your help.<eos> My help?<eos> You have missed this, admit it.<eos> The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through your veins, just the two of us against the rest of the world.<eos> I don't understand, I said I'm sorry, isn't that what you're supposed to do?<eos> Gosh, you don't know anything about human nature, do you?<eos> Hmm, nature?<eos> No.<eos> Human?
And when I get this feeling, I'm usually always right.<eos> Oh, please! Every relationship I've ever had, something felt off.<eos> That's probably why you're wrapping up divorce number five with one of my sorority sisters.<eos> You really like this guy, huh?<eos> So forget all this bullshit and go surprise him.<eos> - It's not bullshit.<eos> - It is. Put on something sexy, get your ass out to Connecticut... and fix that young man's plumbing.<eos> - Don't worry, you look good.<eos> - Thanks. - He'll love it.<eos> - Who?

Stretch it out.<eos> That is it!<eos> From now on, you have to tell me what we're doing, where we're going... and what's happening, 'cause I can't take it anymore!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Well, well.<eos> Look who's here...<eos> the wife and the mistress.<eos> I'm not a mistress.<eos> Not technically, anyway.
Stop! - It's already hooked.<eos> - Come on. It's barely in the red!<eos> It's already in the air, guy.<eos> - That's a $300,000 car, asshole!<eos> - I guess you can afford it, then.<eos> Welcome to New York.<eos> You get back here!<eos> See?<eos> ! This!<eos> This!
Come on.<eos> Just one more.<eos> Go on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, Will, it's time for your pill.<eos> Will, wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> "My dear Evelyn...<eos> "I don't know how to express the sadness "I feel for your loss.<eos> "For our loss.
This is, uh, Beth and Mickey.<eos> Hey.<eos> This place seems cool.<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> You come here a lot?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Is this your first time here?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> I love this song.<eos> Me too.
God, I'm gonna miss you guys.<eos> Oh my god, drama queen.<eos> It'll be summer soon, and we'll be back in this rancid hellhole for three freakin' months.<eos> I know.<eos> Yeah, well, take care.<eos> Don't forget to write.<eos> Yeah. You too, shithead.<eos> - Bye, Kat.<eos> Have a safe flight, all right?<eos> - You too.
Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> what are you doing there?<eos> I have not killed anyone, never ?<eos> I stole that? I was hungry, And me? Closed with those beasts.<eos> Then they let us ... that s? v?<eos> come with me.<eos> M? Mehmet call.<eos> Come garden BE?<eos> Rest? You up.
They fired him.<eos> He killed himself.<eos> They fired me they fired man line flushing shit down a toilet.<eos> This time that shit is fighting back.<eos> 40% go to the man whose funding us. That's Daniel's boss.<eos> The rest ...rest. As ours.<eos> Equal share every man.<eos> Back to your posts.<eos> We are leaving in an hour.<eos> - Equal share?
What happens?<eos> Can we keep coming? Your call.<eos> Can we keep coming?<eos> - It is our lives.<eos> - We continue.<eos> The case now.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Dragging this way.<eos> Come on. Harder.<eos> Harder.
What do you fucking say?<eos> You are going to kill us all.<eos> The gold makes you crazy.<eos> You are not obeying my orders?<eos> What, Fraser?<eos> It is your gold.<eos> That is.<eos> Two hours away been a rich.<eos> Is not it worth the risk?<eos> Back to your posts.
I can handle them.<eos> You go take your break.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Follow me, kids.<eos> Yo, lady!<eos> The museum door is that way.<eos> Yes, it is, but you aren't like the other kids.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> You need to see something special.<eos> Right through that door.
Another Sanchez bullfighter.<eos> You are... The amazing carmelo Sanchez!<eos> Yes!<eos> Capes are for cowards!<eos> Can you help me find Maria posada?<eos> LA muerte can help you.<eos> She helps everyone.<eos> Hold on.<eos> The great Jorge Sanchez!<eos> At your service!
No, you have hearsay, and a box of tapes.<eos> I've been down that road before.<eos> All it does is cough up a few more names to take the heat.<eos> All foot soldiers just like him.<eos> No, if we're going to clean up this city, we have to aim higher.<eos> All of them.<eos> Whether or not you like what happened here today, they will come for you.<eos> They'll do anything to remove you from the equation.<eos> If we don't act fast, you'll be gone.<eos> Your family too.
No, I'm just here to show my face.<eos> And I did that already.<eos> Now you're on your own.<eos> Suck it up, don't fuck it up.<eos> I rely on you now the same way you relied on me.<eos> Those bruises will heal.<eos> How does it feel?<eos> Different.<eos> - Here, give me that.<eos> - No need.
No rules to abide by.<eos> My father, he was a fucking road sweeper.<eos> Shining shoes would have made me a success story compared to him.<eos> So, yes, you and I, we couldn't be more different.<eos> But deep inside, our ambitions are the same.<eos> After all, you came here of your own accord.<eos> Now we've eaten well, drank good wine, there's one thing that you should know about me.<eos> If I'm the type of person who likes to impose my will, I would've already pointed a gun at your head.<eos> But no, that's not me.<eos> Not today at least.
What did you get her?<eos> A kite.<eos> - She'd never flown a kite.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Anyway. Year four, flowers.<eos> She led me outside to the dying rosebush in the backyard.<eos> That's symbolic.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's the gift for five?<eos> Wood.
- No, I just backed away.<eos> Gave her some space.<eos> No big deal, right?<eos> So I thought.<eos> Then one night, Amy comes over to my place... with a bottle of bourbon and a bootleg of this band I love.<eos> And within two minutes, she's got my pants around my ankles... and she is kneeling down, and...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know it's your wife.<eos> - You had sex?<eos> - Yeah, consensual.
"Your devoted Monsieur Gustave."<eos> Then there's a poem, but we might want to start on the soup since it's 46 stanzas.<eos> "A moist, black ash dampens the filth of a dung-dark rat's nest "and mingles with the thick scent of wood rot "while the lark song of a guttersnipe..."<eos> I never trusted that butler.<eos> - He's too honest.<eos> - Too honest, you say?<eos> Right, well, be that as it may, find him quick and make it snappy.<eos> May I offer any of you inmates a plate of mush?<eos> No?<eos> Anyone?
Man, when you were telling the story last night, you had so much detail!<eos> The detail was so rich! It was rich detail!<eos> Go into incredibly descriptive details of the story, so we all know.<eos> Yes.<eos> It was Dora and Diego and swiper.<eos> Swiper?<eos> Who was that you choked out, man?<eos> He had it coming!<eos> Who was that?<eos> Boots.
I'm going to ask you to stop talking.<eos> I thought it was a pretty good idea.<eos> Do the same thing as last time, everyone's happy.<eos> I can't believe the Koreans bought their church back. Yeah.<eos> Good thing there was an even bigger abandoned church directly across the street.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's convenient.<eos> Yes, it is convenient.<eos> Next year, we'll probably just be right back across the street.<eos> Just next door.
Do Heckle and Jeckle know too?<eos> Man.<eos> Just try not to let it spread around the station, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, Frank.<eos> What can you tell us about Tony Delfin?<eos> Worked the guard gate.<eos> He was a top-shelf d-bag.<eos> Yeah, but you haven't seen him around for a long time, right?<eos> - Hopefully?
Since Wilson was murdered, he's due some good luck now.<eos> At least that's what math says.<eos> Would you please stop quoting math like it is a person?<eos> Next you're gonna tell me that math is black.<eos> Don't be ridiculous, son.<eos> - Verb is black.<eos> - Verb is not- verb is black.<eos> - Told you.<eos> Verb.<eos> - Sorry. - Aw.
You've carried it all this way ?<eos> I'm going to plant it in my garden.<eos> In Bag-End.<eos> That's a poor prize to take back to the Shire.<eos> One day it will grow ... and every time I look at it, I'll remember ... remember everything that happened, the good, the bad ... and how lucky I am that I made it home.<eos> Thorin, I-<eos> - Thorin, the survivors from Lake-town, they're streaming into Dale.<eos> There's hundreds of them.<eos> Call everyone to the gate.<eos> To the gate.
What are you following me around for?<eos> Are you religious or something?<eos> No.<eos> Look who found her tongue.<eos> You want to do what I do?<eos> It's not easy.<eos> If that's why you're following me around, I'm not a teacher.<eos> You don't like what you do.<eos> You're watching me?<eos> At night.
Very inspirational.<eos> It's going to stay that way.<eos> That little lander didn't just carry two men to the Moon, it carried the promise of bringing the Moon to everyone on Earth, and I'm not going to let sabotage, revenge, or...<eos> Justice break that promise.<eos> Bon voyage.<eos> Ian Thurgood.<eos> I'm Yama winehart.<eos> I'm your lunar liaison.<eos> The general's daughter.<eos> A pleasure.
Who have you talked to about it?<eos> Russian, Indian, or otherwise.<eos> My russian spy may be compromised.<eos> Hello, Stanislav.<eos> Are the shackles really necessary?<eos> If you arranged to have Martin Thurgood killed.<eos> I steal mining technology and drill bits. I don't kill people.<eos> Nobody else knew about his debriefing.<eos> Have you mentioned his name to somebody?<eos> Nobody.
About time you boys showed up.<eos> Nice boat.<eos> Thanks ladies, built it myself.<eos> Got three more just like it patrolling the harbor.<eos> Two man ground teams every 400m.<eos> Good work.<eos> Just cause you can fly a plane don't make you smarter than me.<eos> Sure it does.<eos> So you're the reason I've been stuck down here in this shithole.<eos> Shithole?
Yes.<eos> But you, with all those ideas in your head, I could not.<eos> Charles, you are a good man.<eos> And a good doctor.<eos> Emma's mother can finally rest knowing I married her well.<eos> This was your mother's favorite wedding gift.<eos> Please think of us when you eat your sweets.<eos> Santé.<eos> - This is Henriette.<eos> - Madame.
Those are only curiosities.<eos> They have no application in Yonville.<eos> But we certainly won't be spending the rest of our lives here.<eos> I would hate to disappoint you, my dear, but I don't see us going to the Orient.<eos> Well, I know that, Charles.<eos> I was thinking Paris, or maybe Rouen.<eos> Do you really believe a country doctor can open a practice in Rouen on a whim?<eos> - It's...<eos> - But you're not a country doctor!<eos> Very good, Madame.
My dear friends!<eos> What good fortune it is to share this moment with all of you today.<eos> I cannot fully grasp the reason for my euphoria this morning.<eos> Hunting is part of my life and my soul.<eos> Who could live more fully... love more deeply, or celebrate so well as the hunter with his horse and his hounds?<eos> So now, my dear friends, on your saddles!<eos> Come in.<eos> - Good morning, Monsieur.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Madame.
And a heart without love is a heart without a voice.<eos> No song, no life.<eos> Do you like this for the fair?<eos> Doesn't feel too austere, does it?<eos> You look beautiful, Madame.<eos> You have such a figure.<eos> A spoonful of vinegar with every meal.<eos> After a week, you don't even taste it anymore.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Madame.
Please, do not push me away!<eos> Yes... indeed.<eos> It took you a lot of courage just to come here, didn't it?<eos> - Madame?<eos> Monsieur Homais.<eos> - Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma.<eos> You are beautiful, you are wise, and you are magic.<eos> - I don't know how you've done it.<eos> - Oh, it's all Monsieur Lheureux.<eos> Monsieur Lheur...?
But you made a promise!<eos> I was being bled myself. The knife was at my throat.<eos> You simply have too many bills.<eos> One gets in quite a muddle over them.<eos> But surely, good Monsieur Lheureux, you can talk to Monsieur Vinçart and quiet him.<eos> Quiet Vinçart?<eos> You don't know him.<eos> He's more ferocious than a bear.<eos> You could try the Marquis.<eos> - The Marquis?
Such a little hothead.<eos> I know it's not very pleasant.<eos> I'm aware of that. But it never killed anyone, did it?<eos> And it's the only way for you to pay me back.<eos> But could you not lend me just a...<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> You have been an excellent patron.<eos> And I have done very well by you.<eos> But in this state, I do not see value in this proposition!<eos> Madame?
I know it's not very pleasant.<eos> I'm aware of that. But it never killed anyone, did it?<eos> And it's the only way for you to pay me back.<eos> But could you not lend me just a...<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> You have been an excellent patron.<eos> And I have done very well by you.<eos> But in this state, I do not see value in this proposition!<eos> Madame?<eos> Madame?
Tomorrow?<eos> Tomorrow we will get married.<eos> I will prove his prediction wrong.<eos> I will prove it.<eos> Sir James Herric and Miss Oprah Brown, you are next.<eos> James isn't here yet.<eos> Talk to the Registrar.<eos> Can you just hold this please?<eos> This is for you.<eos> For me?
Bairo!<eos> - Take that line.<eos> - Brother.<eos> - Oh, pervert boy. So .. you have become a star?<eos> Where are you brother<eos> - I'm still in Mandawa. But I'm coming to meet you tomorrow. Along with a gift.<eos> I have with me the thief who steals your remote control.<eos> He sold your remote at Rs. 40,000.<eos> Ask who did he sell to?<eos> - To whom?
- Are we in trouble?<eos> - No, I'm in trouble.<eos> That guy's gonna throw my sorry ass in jail.<eos> - Maybe we can ask him not to.<eos> - What?<eos> My boyfriend ran that way when he saw your lights 'cause he thinks you're gonna throw his sorry ass in jail.<eos> All right, ma'am.<eos> I need you to step out of the vehicle.<eos> Actually, I think I'd rather stay inside.<eos> Ma'am?
- Daisy.<eos> - Our bathroom is broken.<eos> - You want to use ours?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Then come on and join us by the fire.<eos> So, where you headed, Jay?<eos> - Los Angeles.<eos> - So are we!<eos> We're going to Hollywood to see Howie Mandel.<eos> Deal or no deal?
- Our bathroom is broken.<eos> - You want to use ours?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Then come on and join us by the fire.<eos> So, where you headed, Jay?<eos> - Los Angeles.<eos> - So are we!<eos> We're going to Hollywood to see Howie Mandel.<eos> Deal or no deal?<eos> Deal... or no deal?
Steady!<eos> Closer!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - All right!<eos> I got this!<eos> Go inside!<eos> The hits just keep on coming with you, huh?<eos> Never judge a girl by her Gucci boots.<eos> Her what?<eos> High heels.
I don't live in Ijmuiden, but in Amsterdam.<eos> This is our house.<eos> Maartje?<eos> Are you up there?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> He doesn't know I still have these things.<eos> Don't tell anyone.<eos> - Of course not.<eos> Not even Lambert.
Oh, that's what this is all about. Is it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sad asked me what I wanted and I told him... I want to meet my mother.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, fuck that.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> All I know is that one of Keegans' guys got busted.<eos> Lost an entire load of H.<eos> Now Tommy owes someone.<eos> Who?
Trust me.<eos> You just be very careful with the painting.<eos> Bring it back to the museum They'll know exactly what to do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought you didn't snitch.<eos> I don't.<eos> It's just this guy Carlos ain't from here.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jesus!
He's a veteran, for Christ's sakes.<eos> Stitches.<eos> Told you, Radar-Man.<eos> Double shot, Johnnie Walker Black, please.<eos> You're all sweaty.<eos> You look good sweaty.<eos> You could sip that, you know. It's not medicine.<eos> Sweetheart, it is for me.<eos> You have a good night.<eos> You, too.
Her name is Jane Crenna.<eos> Jen?<eos> Jen, are you there?<eos> You okay?<eos> It was me.<eos> It was me who made her jump.<eos> Santino?<eos> Are you in my house?<eos> I need help.<eos> My house.
Jungler!<eos> You have been vanquished by the blood of Christ!<eos> And by the authority of that blood, I command you to depart this servant of God!<eos> Desist, Jungler!<eos> You know your peril is imminent, and your end is near!<eos> Desist!<eos> Desist!<eos> Desist!<eos> Get ready.<eos> For fucking what?
Trust me.<eos> Neither do you.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> You're not real.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> I'm not frightened.<eos> You can call me Mooney.<eos> Everybody does.<eos> I never liked that name.<eos> Me neither.
Warm, huh?<eos> Don't pay attention to her.<eos> She's just jealous.<eos> Jealous of what?<eos> Of you.<eos> Let's play a game.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna tell you a story...<eos> What kind of story?<eos> A story about me.
You had little a look, too.<eos> - Oh, some tzatziki.<eos> - Oh, that's cute.<eos> No, it is.<eos> It's adorable, Bruce.<eos> That's all right.<eos> You can look. But don't touch 'cause that would be embarrassing, wouldn't it?<eos> - Just leave it to the experts.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - The sexperts.
You okay?<eos> You're freezing.<eos> Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry I had to do all that, but it's gonna be okay.<eos> I promise.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You can't act like this, Gabriel.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> This isn't okay.<eos> You know you're the only one that's allowed to call me that?<eos> You and Dad.
We split the money first.<eos> No need to be greedy.<eos> You're about to inherit the hotel.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You'll see.<eos> I'll see what?<eos> So long, honey.<eos> - Give me the card!<eos> - What?<eos> The card!
I guess you could say we were born into this job.<eos> Hey, look at this freak.<eos> There you go, Derek.<eos> What can I get you?<eos> Old Underwear.<eos> Old Underwear.<eos> Straight up?<eos> Leave the bottle.<eos> From the look of you I'm guessing you're not celebrating.<eos> From the look of me?
- Have you still got his rifle?<eos> Who is it?<eos> Stop it!<eos> Put down your weapon and come with me.<eos> Are you deaf?<eos> I said stop it!<eos> Stop or I'll shoot!<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - For what?<eos> The baptism.
How many times do we have to tell you, that he's clean?<eos> One of two things is going-down here, the kidnappers either know you or they don't.<eos> If they don't, then the fear of who they're messin' with is our best asset.<eos> Once they hear, they'll probably drop her off at a gas station somewhere and she's back by lunch tomorrow.<eos> And if they know me?<eos> They'll be in contact, and we'll be there.<eos> We have a top on your phone.<eos> Either myself or Detective Hansen will be here at all times.<eos> Paul, we'll find her.<eos> You better.
Stop.<eos> Stay right where you are. Listen to me very carefully.<eos> The woman you're with is a killer.<eos> If she panics, you're a dead woman.<eos> I'm right behind you.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Run!<eos> Now!<eos> Run!<eos> Out the back!
You may know the procedure, but then you also know that I have the right to vary the procedure if I deem it necessary.<eos> Based on the tenor of this conversation, I am inclined to vary the procedure.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't give a fuck about the people I've killed.<eos> If by some stroke of pure luck you manage to kill me, then I won't give a fuck about that either.<eos> That was quite a speech.<eos> You bring out the best in me.<eos> Not exactly accurate, that last statement you made.<eos> Keeping him engaged was an advantage, sir.<eos> Yes, to him.
Kim?<eos> It's not Kim.<eos> Man, you gotta let this go.<eos> You do.<eos> Lenore's a grown woman.<eos> She can take care of herself.<eos> You're not her husband any longer.<eos> But she is my friend.<eos> I think you better talk to somebody about this.<eos> A shrink, maybe.
I'll fucking kill you!<eos> Kim.<eos> We need him.<eos> We need him.<eos> Call him.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're gonna set him up for me.<eos> Make the call.<eos> Now.<eos> On speaker.
What's your first priority here, Inspector?<eos> To arrest St. John and charge him with your ex-wife's murder.<eos> My first priority is my daughter.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Go!<eos> Okay, we're leaving now. Come on, let's go.<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Approaching Runway Two.<eos> Ready for takeoff.
Okay, you're getting on my level.<eos> You like the dark stuff.<eos> Okay, hands like this.<eos> Shotgun poetry.<eos> All right, get ready.<eos> "Hark! 'Its an elfin-storm from faery land," of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed.<eos> "I have a home for thee." I win!<eos> Let's take our clothes off.<eos> I'd like to go to the judges on that one.<eos> Okay. Judges?
How do you feel about Robert Pattinson?<eos> Not my favorite actor.<eos> You shut your mouth.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can I get a "whoop, whoop"?<eos> Whoop, whoop.<eos> No.<eos> Don't ever do that again.<eos> Kill an innocent dog or cheat on your girlfriend?<eos> Cheat on my girlfriend.
I told him you were a fan.<eos> Yeah, and, by the way, you're not the only one who thinks... every earthquake could be the end ofthe world.<eos> Some crazy lady cornered him in the airp...<eos> That's not howl meant that.<eos> Anyway... he's a great guy.<eos> Chloe, honey... I don't mean to push. I knowit must feel that way.<eos> Ljust want you to understand.<eos> This is important to me and so are you.<eos> - Ljust want you to be ready.<eos> - Ready for what?
Moml<eos> Mom, please pick up the phone, I don't knowwhat's going on.<eos> Raymie.<eos> If you went home and you can hear me right now, I need you to listen, okay?<eos> I knowthat you're scared, and I'm scared too... but I really need you to pick up the phone.<eos> I need you to let me knowthat you're okay.<eos> I need to hear your voice.<eos> I love you guys.<eos> I think what we should all be doing right now... - is saying a prayer.<eos> - A prayer?

The God my mother talked about would never do something like this.<eos> Chloe, please, listen to me.<eos> Listen to you?<eos> Why should I?<eos> You didn't even listen to you.<eos> The Air Marshal.<eos> I forgot all about him.<eos> PanCon 2- 5-7, this Is Dlspatch.<eos> This is PanCon 2-5-7. Calling Dispatch.<eos> PanCon 2- 5-7.
This is PanCon 2-5-7. Calling Dispatch.<eos> PanCon 2- 5-7.<eos> Thls Is Marcus.<eos> Ray, are you there?<eos> Marcus!<eos> Ray, where are you?<eos> I'm twenty minutes outside ofJFK. I had to turn around.<eos> How many did you lose?<eos> So it is everywhere.<eos> The whole planet, buddy.
I enjoy my wealth.<eos> Two things delight me in my life:<eos> fashioning a nib from steel and making money, and I like to spend my money on things that give me pleasure.<eos> And your pictures give me much pleasure.<eos> I want them, all of them.<eos> Sir... with a modicum of regret and somewhat of a heavy heart, I'm sorry to say, 'tis out of the question.<eos> - How so?<eos> - They are bequeathed.<eos> Bequeathed?<eos> To whom?
- No.<eos> - Because they're embarrassed.<eos> - And we'd be in the back in the trunk by now.<eos> So who the fuck is it?<eos> Where the hell would they fucking get a picture like this?<eos> You know what?<eos> Tommy.<eos> We should call them.<eos> Call who?<eos> Who?
Fuck you.<eos> Put Al on the phone.<eos> There's no one here by that name.<eos> There's no one there named Al?<eos> You better find somebody named fucking Al.<eos> Big Al. Fiorello.<eos> 718-555-4377.<eos> Does that sound about right?<eos> 41 Ocean Avenue, Howard Beach?<eos> Oh, you fancy, huh?
Looks good.<eos> What is it, Momma?<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out of my house!<eos> Whoa, what happened?<eos> Mercy cut me.<eos> Don't go in there.<eos> Get out!<eos> Georgie?<eos> Georgie...
- Dog!<eos> - Caitlin, come here!<eos> Come to me!<eos> - Oh, you're so sweet...<eos> You're great with them.<eos> I love dogs.<eos> I better my sister and I own Branches of light.<eos> - The Greyhound Rescue?<eos> - It's a great organization.<eos> Unfortunately.
You guys are not gonna believe this... But it turns out you didn't qualify for financial.<eos> What?<eos> There must be some mistake.<eos> You two can't afford Edendale!<eos> No, evidently, it's you who can not afford it!<eos> - We got our house! - We got the house!<eos> - We got our house!<eos> - We got Edendale!<eos> Hold on...<eos> - We very sorry.
That's fine.<eos> That's totally fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, bye-bye.<eos> Bye-bye, bye-bye.<eos> What?<eos> I'll be back.<eos> I'll call.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> And Mommy, okay?
Good, good.<eos> So there was a girl who had the gig, and she can't do it.<eos> So you got the job.<eos> It's a lot of dough.<eos> And, so you know, it's... They're gonna need you to... They're gonna need you to...<eos> Need me to what?<eos> We need you to fuck him.<eos> Asshole!<eos> Hey, it's not the kind of request you can prep, okay?<eos> - Jesus.
I'd also like you to meet...<eos> In other words, why should a 21st century man care about the obstacles facing a 19th century woman?<eos> No, that makes me sound like a misogynist. I love and respect women.<eos> As long as they're not writing.<eos> On the contrary, there are myriad women writers I adore.<eos> - Can you name one?<eos> - Elaine May.<eos> I'm not familiar with her work.<eos> Oh, she wrote A New Leaf, The Birdcage, she did an uncredited rewrite on Tootsie.<eos> Movies?
Yeah, and now he's, like, a top guy in his field.<eos> The thing is, you see, I would argue late bloomers may have had talent all along.<eos> It was just unrecognised.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> I disagree.<eos> I think it's just about focusing.<eos> Right.<eos> I wish you'd focused on my umbrella.<eos> Oh, it's a good thing I don't work on commission.<eos> Hat?
Thank you, Clem.<eos> You've made me quite jealous.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> So...<eos> - Now, listen...<eos> - Good luck.<eos> Write.<eos> No, I definitely will.<eos> Or email.
Go and speak with your brother, or... or take this blade, push it into your ribs right now.<eos> Stay in hell for all eternity.<eos> One day, Hvitserk, you will ride a horse, just like this.<eos> Ragnar.<eos> You should all leave.<eos> - Come on, boys.<eos> - Ubbe, go with your mother.<eos> I said everyone.<eos> Well, I just thought...<eos> Everyone.
I'll call a taxi.<eos> - We can give you a lift.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Do you want to go in?<eos> Yes.<eos> There you go.<eos> - Have a nice day.<eos> - You too.
Oh, I'll get this.<eos> No, no let me get this, please.<eos> This was my idea.<eos> You can get the next one.<eos> Alright.<eos> I like your hat, by the way.<eos> Thank you!<eos> It's new.<eos> You're very dear to me, you know?<eos> To all of us.
I'll tell you what he needs.<eos> A decent period of mourning, a year or two, then get married again.<eos> Who would marry him, Rose?<eos> -You'd be surprised, Quirke.<eos> -I would be surprised.<eos> -So what about you?<eos> -What about me?<eos> Don't you ever get lonely?<eos> Who doesn't, Rose?<eos> Nobody.
-Yes, I have.<eos> Why do you think I would need your forgiveness?<eos> -Well... No, it's just that it... -No, listen to me,<eos> I don't need your forgiveness and I don't need anybody else's!<eos> Have you got that?<eos> -I'm sorry, I just...<eos> -What?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me too.
He broke my nose!<eos> Alex: What have you got, Zach?<eos> Oh, real sweetheart, 45, penetrating abdominal wound, left lower quadrant.<eos> This your first day back?<eos> Yep.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's get some extra hands over here.<eos> We got a big guy for this transfer.<eos> Here we go.<eos> [whimpering] On my count.
Thank you.<eos> It's all in a day's work.<eos> And... [sighs] there's this.<eos> A few days ago, a patient of mine passed away, um, and I found this among his personal effects.<eos> His... his name was...<eos> Roy Wilson?<eos> Roy died, huh?<eos> Yeah, he did, unfortunately.<eos> I liked him.<eos> Me, too.
Right.<eos> I got your blood test back.<eos> So, what's my FSH?<eos> I'm guessing 6, 7?<eos> 22.<eos> 22?<eos> Your eggs are...<eos> Paleolithic. Yeah, I get it.<eos> Dawn, with these levels, I think we should be considering egg donation.<eos> We?
So, wait, Lara is g... you guys are... you're gonna deliver the baby...<eos> Today.<eos> You're gonna meet your son today.<eos> I didn't see the posterior malleolus fracture on the X-ray.<eos> See, but I... No, it's pretty subtle.<eos> But, um, you did notice that the ankle wasn't congruent, which is very thorough.<eos> - Mm. - She's a lucky kid.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Kid?<eos> Me?
Okay.<eos> Are you in any pain?<eos> No, I don't...<eos> I don't feel anything.<eos> Wait, so you're the only one who can see me.<eos> That's insane.<eos> Yeah, it definitely feels that way sometimes.<eos> Invisible, but not dead.<eos> So just like high school, basically?<eos> Basically.
Hey. Promise.<eos> Dr. Murphy... did he leave a forwarding number?<eos> I need his opinion on a former patient.<eos> Oh, a dirty mug, some files, but no number.<eos> I don't think he was keen on being found.<eos> So, I-I read your paper on LSD.<eos> So, you're interested in hallucinations.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Um... well, I might have a patient for you.<eos> A referral?
What you're teaching is antitheism.<eos> It's not enough that you don't believe.<eos> You need all of us to not believe with you.<eos> Why don't you admit the truth?<eos> You just want to ensnare them in your primitive superstition.<eos> What I want is for them to make their own choice.<eos> That's what God wants.<eos> You have no idea how much I'm gonna enjoy failing you.<eos> Yeah, but who are you really looking to fail, Professor?<eos> Me or God?
I told you to love him.<eos> I could not breathe with the weight, without the breakup.<eos> Already paid your son's life.<eos> There is no guarantee ...<eos> In death.<eos> In death.<eos> We do this because of one thing.<eos> - Okay ...<eos> - You join the rebellion.<eos> What rebellion?
- It's a stupid idea.<eos> - It works!<eos> - You're in luck.<eos> - To the penyelamatanku place.<eos> - Now a street fighter.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> We will not go into the silver speed immediately.<eos> What are they?<eos> Part shield generator, we are trapped in a gravitational field!<eos> All units to the palace.
Well, what am I gonna do?<eos> I'm your best friend.<eos> I know.<eos> That's... That's why I want you to have these.<eos> Albert, these are your favorite socks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I want you to have that.<eos> Edward, this is your lucky handkerchief. Yeah.<eos> It's sticky.<eos> Well, hello to you, too!
And I'm gonna smoke a fucking cigar to celebrate.<eos> I don't think Clinch would like you talking about him that way.<eos> Not a nice thing for a man's wife to say about her husband.<eos> Yeah, well, let's see if he gets here before you find yourself at the end of a rope.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> Guys, no, no, no.<eos> Andrew, Jonathan, no. Go, go, go. Go home.<eos> Hey, sheep boy.
If I can shoot six out of six on Albert's behalf, you owe him a dollar.<eos> If I can't,<eos> - he owes you a dollar.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - A dollar?<eos> - I've never seen a dollar.<eos> Nobody's got a dollar!<eos> Let us see the dollar!<eos> Well, this is interesting.<eos> All right.
It's Albert Stark.<eos> Albert Stark.<eos> That's better.<eos> I've been keeping it nice and soft.<eos> See?<eos> Mmm! I've missed you, baby. Oh, I've missed you a lot.<eos> The longer the ride, the lonelier a man gets.<eos> And he needs the comforting touch of the woman he loves to soothe his tired bones.<eos> And now, I'm here, you're here, and we have time to be husband and wife.<eos> The proper way.
Have you travelled 'I<eos> I travel with this.<eos> - Have you ever been out of Italy 'I<eos> Yes, but...<eos> I'm gains"-<eos> No more taking orders from that arsehole.<eos> He's your brother, isn't he 'I<eos> - And what do you know?<eos> - Is he your brother or not 'I<eos> On my father's side.
Holy shit.<eos> When can I meet him'?<eos> He's with Larry now.<eos> I'm going to Starbucks.<eos> Want anything?<eos> I'm good.<eos> She has a great ass.<eos> I have news for you, too.<eos> Is it good or bad?<eos> 'Cause I really...
Riggan?<eos> Your gun is ridiculous.<eos> I can see the red plug in the barrel... so you look like a kid with a plastic toy when you point it at me.<eos> I don't feel threatened at all.<eos> Get a better one.<eos> Have some self-respect. Please.<eos> Hey, apart from that, uh...<eos> I thought it was a pretty fun crowd, huh?<eos> I don't think it's high enough.<eos> Me, neither.
You have a path, you're going to be great, I'm gonna be forgotten and you won't be able to give me the time of day because you have bigger things to pursue.<eos> That's exactly my point.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> You're right. We should not be dating.<eos> I'm okay. Thanks.<eos> Fuck! Fuck!<eos> Fucking piece of shit!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fucking piece of shit!
You know, the ones that are famous in the Republic of Cancervania for not working.<eos> It's called Phalanxifor.<eos> It didn't work in over 70% of the patients... but for some reason it's been working for me.<eos> So, they called it "The Miracle."<eos> Of course, my lungs still suck at being lungs... but, theoretically, they could continue to suck like this... for, I don't know, a while maybe.<eos> So, are you back in school?<eos> I got my GED, so I'm taking classes at MCC.<eos> Whoa! A college girl!<eos> Well, that explains the aura of sophistication.<eos> Oh! Careful!
And he's really all right?<eos> No, I'm gonna marry some douchebag.<eos> Uh, hello?<eos> He's a good guy.<eos> Well, he better be.<eos> He is.<eos> He's good with the boys.<eos> He likes my mother.<eos> He likes your mother?<eos> Sober?
Huh. But maybe there is a reason why the characters have to be near gothic buildings, like, um, it's set at a university or something.<eos> Well, there you go!<eos> Bing!<eos> We solved it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, let's stick a pin in that.<eos> What else have you got?<eos> All right.<eos> This one's a comedy.<eos> Up your alley.
I just got off with TMZ.<eos> They're about to run a story.<eos> They've got it on good authority you're going into rehab for cocaine and diet pills.<eos> Are you shitting me?<eos> So you're not?<eos> No.<eos> Honest?<eos> How can you even ask me that?<eos> Uh, you were a little sniffy at lunch, and you didn't touch the bread.<eos> Jesus.
I didn't even know you were going.<eos> Listen to me, you lunatic.<eos> You're gonna call them and say you were wrong.<eos> What is the big deal?<eos> Everybody's in rehab.<eos> I-I can't say it again.<eos> He's not going into rehab.<eos> And if people think he is, it could seriously damage his career.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> What career?
He'll change his mind.<eos> You'll see.<eos> You two will be married and live happily ever after.<eos> Well, you didn't get married.<eos> So you aren't qualified to advise in that regard.<eos> But of course.<eos> I've been happily married to the law for 45 years.<eos> Hello, Alemu?<eos> Can you come with the reporters tomorrow morning?<eos> To the village police station.
Is this who you are?<eos> And why are you so mean to her?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Seems you two have a lot to talk about.<eos> Why do you have to drag us into this?<eos> Ove-Kenneth is the world's nicest guy.<eos> And why would I ruin everything for Elin and... and...?<eos> Einar.<eos> -Why not just let them get together?<eos> -That guy?
It'll be for the best.<eos> What will be for the best?<eos> What will be, will be for the best.<eos> Did you ever really love us, Dad?<eos> It has been reported by Mr. Clark, the school's attendance inspector, that this has been a particularly tiresome case of truancy and parental neglect.<eos> His recommendation is that the children be sent to separate institutions for their own educational benefits and welfare.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hold it down now.<eos> Down the stairs.
I'll get you one to have a go-off.<eos> You've done well, girl.<eos> Keep it up now.<eos> Don't let a good beginning slip away from you, like so many others.<eos> Thank you, Mr. O'Reilly, I won't.<eos> That little redheaded fella must have been contagious.<eos> He would have given me the flu.<eos> Where'd you live, Shoes?<eos> Me?<eos> Um, down at black pits?
I'll walk, you lead.<eos> Kahm uhn.<eos> This is private property.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Sorry, the kite came over the wall outside.<eos> Thank you for returning it.<eos> Is this a school?<eos> No, it is a government orphanage of Binh Dai district, private property.<eos> Is it ever possible to visit the children?<eos> Sometimes... but strictly with permission.

Do you see how important it is to elicit the appropriate response?<eos> Yes.<eos> To this auspicious end, the finest examples of humanity shall embody the true glory of France in a palace of eternal and resounding splendor.<eos> Take note.<eos> Your eloquence they must love, your demeanor they must fear.<eos> I have further commanded that the greatest masters of France will realize this vision unparalleled in the history of the world in gardens of exquisite and matchless beauty.<eos> Heaven... shall be here.<eos> The light is fading, master.<eos> Torches!<eos> Madame?
I'm not disheartened.<eos> He seems not disheartened, too.<eos> Madame de Barra.<eos> - Well, gentlemen.<eos> - Best of fates to you.<eos> Claude Moulin, madame.<eos> Secretary to Master Le Notre.<eos> - Have you met the master before?<eos> - I have not.<eos> - Madame.
- Later, messieurs.<eos> - Gentlemen.<eos> Welcome to Versailles.<eos> You found your way here without too much effort, I hope.<eos> The map you sent was wonderfully accurate.<eos> I shall need it to get back out again.<eos> We shall be traveling about a bit.<eos> Madame de Barra, Monsieur Sualem and De Ville.<eos> They are building the Marly waterworks and an aqueduct from there to Versailles, which we hope will alleviate the severe water shortage here. - Madame.<eos> - Gentlemen.
The king's commands are not infinite, De Ville.<eos> They are the king's commands.<eos> Well, quite so, but the aqueduct can only do so much.<eos> When we began construction, I was under the impression that...<eos> The past is history.<eos> Our task is to suppress nature to our will, according to the present plans.<eos> But, monsieur, the money being spent.<eos> The aqueduct will carry sufficient water to the gardens of Versailles because it must.<eos> That is your brief.<eos> Madame?
- Here.<eos> - One of your gardeners?<eos> Perfect.<eos> I must accompany the marquise to supper.<eos> I could surrender my new friend into your care?<eos> Of course.<eos> Guard her well, monsieur.<eos> The vultures are circling.<eos> It has been my pleasure.<eos> Madame?
And then the time and the place.<eos> This little woman's secret life.<eos> I feel the loss of it.<eos> I should like to marry again.<eos> This time someone I choose, not the state.<eos> - Has Your Majesty someone in mind?<eos> - I have, but the lady's very pious.<eos> Most evenings I stroll over to her rooms, and we just sit and talk.<eos> But... it is the ease of it I like.<eos> The ease.
- You may not need to.<eos> - Just secure them, then.<eos> We should cover these tiers.<eos> - I need more rope.<eos> - I need more food.<eos> - In the warm.<eos> - You go on, I'll follow.<eos> Madame de Barra.<eos> My name is Le Notre.<eos> Madame.
I commended all my children into Maintenon's care.<eos> How she has turned on me now.<eos> Saintly old bitch.<eos> It is an amazement to me a convent has not claimed her.<eos> Costume's not as lavish.<eos> The king comes.<eos> Have you been presented before?<eos> No.<eos> Your Majesty, it is my pleasure to present Madame de Barra.<eos> Madame.
And horseshoe nails.<eos> We have a blacksmith... if you need your horse shoed.<eos> Aren't the women taking care of you?<eos> Hans told you... to take good care of your guest.<eos> And what Hans wants... he gets.<eos> Right?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Did anyone ask you?<eos> I'll have a schnapps.<eos> And one for him, too.
I dorft Want you to get in trouble... but we got to get this all sorted out.<eos> L-low<eos> - I clon't even care anymore. L<eos> - Really, just- I'll cash 'em later.<eos> It shouldrft take her too much longer.<eos> We got to Wait for someone else to get here.<eos> - Who?<eos> - I had to call someone else in.<eos> - You know, protocol.<eos> - Who'?
L-low<eos> - I clon't even care anymore. L<eos> - Really, just- I'll cash 'em later.<eos> It shouldrft take her too much longer.<eos> We got to Wait for someone else to get here.<eos> - Who?<eos> - I had to call someone else in.<eos> - You know, protocol.<eos> - Who'?<eos> Who?
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I see that they've been signed over to you.<eos> I get that.<eos> In my business, this is Whats called a "red flag."<eos> First off, we clon't cash checks that are signed over like that.<eos> "Red flag." Is that a, uh, technical term?<eos> You're trying to be an asshole?<eos> 'Cause I'm trying to be cool.<eos> Novv, anytime someone comes in here with something like this... I'm trained to call the authorities.<eos> Authorities?
I could do with a drink.<eos> I know a dive open till 4:00.<eos> How about it?<eos> - If their fleet falls to the Nazis...<eos> - We lose the war.<eos> The British will destroy the entire French fleet rather than hand it over to the Nazis.<eos> - Do you have the authority to negotiate? - Of course.<eos> Would it matter if I really loved him?<eos> The trick is to never let it show.<eos> Just a little shaken.
Let's talk about your ex, Dora Lange.<eos> You want to talk Dori?<eos> What's she said I've done now?<eos> Nothing.<eos> We're just curious if you knew what she's been up to and maybe where she's living.<eos> CHARLIE: Nope.<eos> Got her divorce papers pushed through after I been here about a year.<eos> I don't blame the bitch.<eos> She got a habit?<eos> [Chuckles] Yeah, a few.
If you quote one more piece of Bible porn at me, I...<eos> Doug, drop it.<eos> JC, stop staring at my ass.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Yeah, yeah, right, okay.<eos> Or did you forget, Jeannie, that, uh, JC doesn't like girls.<eos> What? I like girls.<eos> Oh, yeah, you just don't like to have sex with them.<eos> By choice.
So good to see you, buddy.<eos> I missed this.<eos> I really did.<eos> Good to see you, yeah, man.<eos> Clyde, so good to see you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> God, I missed you.<eos> I did.<eos> Do you know what I miss, though?<eos> The cheap espresso over here.
I did.<eos> Do you know what I miss, though?<eos> The cheap espresso over here.<eos> Come on, don't do that.<eos> It is so expensive where I am.<eos> Clyde, you can say it, you can say you miss me, too.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Men can say that.<eos> Men in suspenders can do that.<eos> Men, period.
In 3 days, you'll beg me to stay.<eos> Promise.<eos> Alright.<eos> We're allowed magical moments in our lives.<eos> Those 3 days were good, really good.<eos> I went all out.<eos> Platini at Geoffroy Guichard.<eos> Saint-Etienne by night.<eos> It was classy.<eos> Really classy.
A pretty girl like you?<eos> No.<eos> Would you date my son?<eos> He's a great guy.<eos> He has everything going for him.<eos> To make a woman happy.<eos> Are you sure you want to quit politics?<eos> I'm not quitting.<eos> I'm going back to the roots.<eos> The grassroots.
Yes, but have I shown him how much I love him?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm sorry, mate.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> I'm sick. - What with?<eos> - A cold.<eos> - In July? - Illnesses don't take holidays.<eos> You're going to miss the World Cup final?<eos> Yeah. I'll watch it on telly.<eos> On the radio.
We can't fool Him about those disgusting acts.<eos> Aren't you ashamed?<eos> Jiménez, what are you laughing at?<eos> Do you find it funny what I'm saying?<eos> Come over here.<eos> Undress.<eos> As God brought you into the world, so you'll feel what Adam felt when he was expelled from paradise. And you'll learn to respect your superiors. Kneel here.<eos> Quichas, help me.<eos> The heaviest Bibles.<eos> For your classmate.
There's a hammer under the couch.<eos> He was just the building's rent-a-cop.<eos> Then why is this a police officer's card?<eos> Well, he just became one.<eos> All right?<eos> He was dropping off his keys.<eos> It was his last shift.<eos> I didn't tell him anything about you or the machine, so...<eos> I would love to believe that.<eos> Unfortunately,
That's too bad.<eos> That lady didn't mean us any harm.<eos> What about the gun in her hand?<eos> She wasn't going to use it.<eos> You don't fucking know that, okay?<eos> And if I didn't act, then Callie would be waking up to our dead bodies!<eos> At the very least, the police would have shown up.<eos> Sounds like Jasper was just trying to protect us.<eos> Well, you were not there.<eos> Ready for your big moment?
Are you willing to take that risk?<eos> Berlin's about to fall.<eos> This will soon all be over.<eos> I disagree.<eos> This is just the beginning.<eos> Good to see you, sir.<eos> It's just as I remember.<eos> I wondered whether to come, you know.<eos> I almost convinced myself I wouldn't miss the place.<eos> Or the people.
Actually, this place is really going to the dogs.<eos> One bumps into all sorts of people.<eos> Since the war, they let anyone in.<eos> It's a bit like Paddington station.<eos> I presume that means you've met someone you dislike.<eos> Well, I notice that woman is staying here.<eos> Ann O'Neill.<eos> I saw her in the lobby yesterday.<eos> Well, I'm not sure that my choice of bridge partners is any of your concern.<eos> Bridge.
Looks like she let her go.<eos> Well, do you think someone could have found him?<eos> Nah, no.<eos> No, the power's out in the whole region.<eos> I mean they're there, right.<eos> We going to have to wade in?<eos> No way, the water's freezing.<eos> We could uhh...<eos> Well, right there.<eos> How about that.
Cheers, everyone. Cheers.<eos> Cue the music.<eos> (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)<eos> And Teddy in three, two--<eos> (APPLAUSE)<eos> Since 1869, when I was a mere boy of 11... this museum has been a shining beacon to our great city.<eos> Tonight we'll expand our horizons even further... to the Sun... the Moon, and the stars.<eos> (MOUTHING)<eos> From our very beginning... mankind has looked to the heavens and given names to what he saw.<eos> The constellations.
Larry said you could be trusted.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> (WHISPERING) With the top secret knowledge.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm winking.<eos> You're blinking.<eos> No, I wink with both eyes.<eos> That's blinking.<eos> It doesn't matter, because right now... you better get ready!<eos> For what?
Now you tell me where you're from!<eos> They said there's water here.<eos> Who said?<eos> Which direction you come from?<eos> At the blacktop, we went right, so two days to the left I guess.<eos> Gray bell?<eos> No way!<eos> Caddy.<eos> Turn around slow.<eos> Beautiful, this way.
Make your jokes.<eos> But I'm going to lay down the law right now!<eos> I keep the rent money in the old coffee pot and, I keep the...<eos> Well why'd the landlord come to me for the money?<eos> Oh, well that was a misunderstanding.<eos> I was busy when he came, so I said "go to the old pot and get the money"<eos> I'm going down town to pay these bills.<eos> I spoke to Robbie today.<eos> What's that?<eos> On the radio.

"Bad"?<eos> Why'd you think that?<eos> I was married, Marty, for 3 years.<eos> We had a... baby girl.<eos> She died.<eos> Car accident.<eos> She was two years old.<eos> Marriage couldn't handle it.<eos> Your kid died?<eos> Oh, I...
Come on.<eos> I thought this was the part where we share and bond.<eos> Seems like the part where I find out how much of a pain in the ass you are.<eos> What is it?<eos> The kidnappers are Chinese.<eos> How could you possibly know that?<eos> There you are.<eos> Cassidy's pocket recorder.<eos> I caught it when we walked up.<eos> Bluetooth.
- What am I doing wrong?<eos> Been on a hosepipe ban all summer.<eos> Maybe if you didn't shark them together like a couple of schweffes.<eos> I haven't had so little sex since boarding school.<eos> You had more sex at boarding school.<eos> OK, hands up, who did fuck-all work over the vac?<eos> Tubes, you worked?<eos> Fucking jurisprudence essay, Dad breathing down my neck.<eos> If I don't get a 2:1... - Ooh!<eos> Touché.
Mate, it's the club, right?<eos> We all did this.<eos> Did you say anything?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You?<eos> Mate.<eos> Remember when you did the bedroom trash?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whose room did you do first?<eos> Why?
Sorry to disturb you.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Alistair Ryle?<eos> They found bits of the landlord under Ryle's fingernails.<eos> Bits?<eos> I don't know, skin and stuff.<eos> And they've charged him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just him?
- I need a list.<eos> - A list?<eos> Yeah, of the lies we're going to tell.<eos> In case I forget one.<eos> - That is a clove hitch.<eos> - It's just a list would be helpful.<eos> - Has anyone seen my house keys?<eos> - Oh, M25 slow moving between...<eos> - Keys, keys, keys.<eos> ...well, everywhere.
Why don't we ask Eric if he knows how to put?<eos> - It is Norman, Mum.<eos> - Norman, as I was saying, why don't we ask Norman if he knows how to put a seat belt on?<eos> He's a breeze block!<eos> And he doesn't have arms!<eos> How could he possibly put my seat belt on?<eos> Right, I'm putting it on.<eos> It's the stone that needs the seat belt.<eos> Because if we brake hard, it will go straight through your head or Daddy's head if he's driving...<eos> for your information.
He wanted to be cremated.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> - and your children are too small! - Enough!<eos> Odin.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Sorry, no photos.<eos> Thank you all so much for coming.<eos> Gordie would be pleased to see so many of his friends gathered together.<eos> Except sadly,
It'll bore you to tears, but your wife will love it.<eos> I have set myself beyond the pale.<eos> I am nothing.<eos> I am hardly human anymore.<eos> I am the French Lieutenant's... whore.<eos> You don't like it?<eos> No.<eos> I think it's good.<eos> You believe her?<eos> - The woman?
Oh, sure.<eos> It's gonna look great in our bedroom.<eos> Uh, can-- can we go back to the hotel so I can go swimming?<eos> We'll head back in a little while.<eos> Come on, guys, I want to go on the bumper cars.<eos> Oleg Igorevich.<eos> Beeman!<eos> We need to take a drive.<eos> - Drive?<eos> - To the Colonel's house.
That's all right.<eos> Are you Hicham's wife?<eos> Yes, but he isn't here.<eos> When will he be back?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Could you call him to find out when he'II be back?<eos> Or if I can see him where he is?<eos> Sorry to insist but I really need to see him.<eos> He can help me to keep myjob and stay off the dole.<eos> Aissou...
He'II know.<eos> He'II ask the others, he'II ask me.<eos> Don't be afraid. Half will have voted like you.<eos> But I'm on a fixed-term contract, like Jérôme.<eos> It's due for renewal at the end of September.<eos> If Jean-Marc puts in a bad report about my welding mistakes, my contract won't be renewed.<eos> You're like me. You're scared of Jean-Marc.<eos> Yes.<eos> Bye, kids.<eos> Bye, Manu.
A duel between gentlemen, supervised according to the strict code of honour.<eos> Fine.<eos> In a fair fight, I'm a match for anyone.<eos> Confidence.<eos> I like that in a man.<eos> Still, why fight fair when you might lose?<eos> Your problem, eh?<eos> Attacking an unarmed opponent defies every principle of chivalry.<eos> Close enough.<eos> En garde.
I'm sure you find other ways to amuse yourself.<eos> I'd much rather amuse myself with you.<eos> Why not Adele?<eos> Oh, I don't know, let's think.<eos> Because she's the mistress of the most powerful man in France?<eos> Gentlemen, I love her.<eos> You love her?<eos> Or you love stealing what belongs to the Cardinal?<eos> You three!<eos> My office. Now.
He waited all night for Cornet and his men.<eos> They never appeared.<eos> Well, a troop of Musketeers can't just vanish into thin air.<eos> The Abbot was also told to expect an envoy from Spain.<eos> Treville didn't mention a Spanish envoy.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> He didn't appear either.<eos> Cornet is a fine soldier.<eos> If he's gone missing, there's a good reason.<eos> Or a bad one.
I'm not opposed to it, but... it's not as important as people make it.<eos> - I think touching's more important.<eos> If you do it right, you can feel it always... even after you stop.<eos> I'm hungry. You have any food?<eos> I can make an egg white omelet with some spinach!<eos> Mike! Mikey!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Tony, shots.<eos> Shots for everybody.<eos> Hey, Ryan.
You can say that again.<eos> Has Ethan...<eos> I mean your Ethan...<eos> Have you guys talked about anything or has he said anything to you at all?<eos> Like What?<eos> Well, Ethan...<eos> My Ethan and I, we've discussed it.<eos> Like he knew when I was going to go in the house and I knew when he was going to and...<eos> You shared your experiences.<eos> Yeah, for the most part.
Will do.<eos> As long as it keeps me touching the ground ...<eos> Where do I put the tea?<eos> There.<eos> I take that.<eos> Hamdi Hodja, come here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Listen, Hamdi.<eos> I own several houses and shops in town.<eos> Not to me only, actually ...
Uh, creepy crawlies.<eos> Creepy crawlies.<eos> That's what daddy used to call them.<eos> I miss him.<eos> Me too.<eos> I need to tell you something.<eos> I'm moving out.<eos> What?<eos> I'm moving in with someone.<eos> Who?
What?<eos> I'm moving in with someone.<eos> Who?<eos> His name is Bill.<eos> Yeah, you know him?<eos> Wait... is that the person that you've been seeing?<eos> Yeah, how do you know Bill?<eos> Just from around.<eos> I like Bill.<eos> Me too.
I'll handle the business.<eos> You fetch me Amber.<eos> It's really loud!<eos> Louder, the better.<eos> She fast?<eos> That was awesome.<eos> We'll make a biker out of you yet.<eos> Amber told me.<eos> About you and her.<eos> You cool with that?
Here, look at this.<eos> [chatting]<eos> Don't ask, just take it.<eos> Oh yeah, we just found out.<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> [chatter]<eos> FrauBloom, keepa closeeyeon Master Drago today.<eos> It's clear.<eos> Ivan, Principal Possum is gone!<eos> Gentlemen!
Frozen solid.<eos> We sent an expedition in search of them, all they brought back was a bag.<eos> Do you really think I'm that stupid?<eos> Mr. Profoundus, is everything alright?<eos> Where's the boy?<eos> Deactivatethealarm!<eos> Yessir,immediately.<eos> Make a note, loyalty test failed.<eos> Tell the panmonitors to fetch Mr. and Mrs. Drago.<eos> Anunciacion.

Do you remember that oath you took?<eos> Crazy Man.<eos> I gave him his name, you know.<eos> Did you?<eos> Aye. He liked it.<eos> It weren't because he was a nutter.<eos> Something would happen or he'd read a poem or somebody would say something, he'd think about it... Yeah.<eos> ..shake his head and say, "That's crazy, man."<eos> Always said it.<eos> About everything.
Promotion.<eos> Increased responsibility?<eos> Advancement?<eos> Traffic.<eos> I spent 15 years in traffic.<eos> There comes a time when it is unseemly for senior officers to still be rocking the boat, ignoring orders, getting themselves shot, you know the sort of thing.<eos> Are you saying I'm an embarrassment, sir?<eos> I'm saying I'd hate to see you embarrass yourself.<eos> Who would?<eos> You or ACC Hale?
Oh, so you've swapped one uniform for another?<eos> Unlike myself.<eos> So I see, Brigadier Phillips.<eos> I'm fighting an impulse to salute.<eos> Seems a long time since you and Archie and the rest dragged a wet-behind-the-ears lieutenant through Italy.<eos> So you'd kept in touch?<eos> No, not really, but you turn up, don't you?<eos> Archie was a warrior.<eos> Saved my life more than once.<eos> Mine, too.
So, if you could, would you please tell us why you think Scott might do something like this?<eos> You say he attacked someone completely unprovoked?<eos> Apparently, yes.<eos> Scott was exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia.<eos> The onset of which often occurs in men in their early 20s.<eos> He MAY have had a psychotic episode.<eos> Could you elaborate on that for us?<eos> Well, schizophrenics often experience bouts of extreme paranoia, delusions, even hallucinations.<eos> Had Scott had these episodes before?<eos> Not to my knowledge.
You, you maggot, get down and give me ten!<eos> Go!<eos> It saves lives, John.<eos> And it builds character for later life.<eos> Made you the man you are today, did it?<eos> In more ways than you could possibly know, John.<eos> I'm not sure you're such a great advert, sir.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Some of it.
Taylor.<eos> Oi!<eos> Let go of him.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Calm down.<eos> In the van.<eos> Let me talk to him!<eos> Where are you taking him?<eos> Scott's been charged with murder.<eos> Scotty?
Then we can decide how we're going to proceed.<eos> Cover it up, you mean?<eos> I mean, do your job, man.<eos> And shove it up the chain of command.<eos> And any requests for military interviews come to me, as requested.<eos> Right...<eos> Just to be clear, I've just told your guvnor that no-one, no-one speaks to the Army without my say-so.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You?
You have to understand.<eos> We know the Soviets and the Chinese are running similar tests.<eos> So we drop to their level?<eos> I had a job to do.<eos> It was your job to drive Scott Tanner insane?<eos> Scott Tanner was mentally unstable when he walked through the door.<eos> Weak.<eos> We learned that quickly.<eos> The brutal truth is that this fact made him the most useful subject, the most susceptible.<eos> To what?
So, well done, for bringing him to justice.<eos> Why did you want to see me?<eos> I wanted to tell you to your face.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> I'm going to file a report.<eos> Against Archie Leeson and the others.<eos> For the boy.<eos> What good does it do now?<eos> Who can it possibly serve?<eos> Just me, really.
Like a rocky promontory.<eos> At any rate, I have a meeting to attend.<eos> Shall we?<eos> When I get my share of that Spanish gold,<eos> I'm going to fuck my way through high society.<eos> Nary a duchess's snatch be uncharted.<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> You said tie it to the palm.<eos> That palm.<eos> That one.
It would seem, sir, that something's gone terribly wrong with the operation here and you two are scrambling to save yourselves.<eos> Tell me I'm wrong.<eos> Let me tell you how wrong you are.<eos> I knew you wouldn't approve.<eos> But I couldn't let him leave here without giving up those guns.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> With everything we've been through, with everything I've done for you...<eos> - I'm doing this for us both.<eos> - You lied.<eos> Shame on you.
You could resist me.<eos> You could take this whole fucking island from me.<eos> You know exactly what it is you need to do.<eos> Where it is you need to go to do it.<eos> If only you weren't so goddamn afraid.<eos> Ain't this a sad sight?<eos> Miss Guthrie should have just had you killed.<eos> It would have been more merciful.<eos> Now, are you going to give me back me whore?<eos> Jesus!
Now you're talking.<eos> OK. Bye!<eos> Er, we're just going to...<eos> I need, um, Sherlock to help me choose some er...<eos> Ties. Socks.<eos> Why don't we go with socks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, you've got to get the right ones.<eos> Exactly, to go with my...<eos> Tie. Outfit.
Not you!<eos> You.<eos> It's always you.<eos> John Watson, you keep me right.<eos> What do I do?<eos> You've already done it.<eos> Don't solve the murder.<eos> Save the life.<eos> Sorry, off piste a bit.<eos> Back now. Phew!
What are you doing here?<eos> I phoned him.<eos> The siren call of old habits.<eos> How very like Uncle Rudy.<eos> Though in many ways, cross-dressing would have been a wiser path for you.<eos> You phoned him.<eos> Of course I bloody phoned him.<eos> Of course he bloody did.<eos> Now save me a little time - where should we be looking?<eos> "We"?
How did she save your life?<eos> She phoned the ambulance.<eos> I phoned the ambulance.<eos> She phoned first.<eos> 'Emergency, which service do you require?<eos> ' You didn't find me for another five minutes.<eos> Left to you, I would have died.<eos> The average arrival time for a London ambulance is...<eos> Did somebody call an ambulance?<eos> Eight minutes.
God, I love email!<eos> People never learn.<eos> Wait, this was sent to Erich Blunt?<eos> How the hell does this guy know Erich Blunt? Who's Erich Blunt?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We all had dream worlds as kids...<eos> Places where we would go to escape.<eos> For me, it was inside this view-master. Belonged to my grandmother.<eos> Then my mom.
'Leave him alone, Stuart.'<eos> What's the matter, Carl?<eos> You jealous?<eos> 'Piss off.'<eos> Stop arguing, you two.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> It's not my fault you're afraid of intimacy, Carl.<eos> 'And it's not my fault either.<eos> 'You have no idea.'<eos> Ta-da.
Well, I just wanted to say thank you.<eos> What for?<eos> I haven't done anything.<eos> It's just nice to talk to a fellow human.<eos> Makes me feel like I exist.<eos> See you then.<eos> Look, do you want a quick drink?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Just one for the road.<eos> One.
But I don't have Angry Birds.<eos> You do now.<eos> Grace?<eos> Go finish your work, mamita.<eos> And give the man back his phone.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm Gladys, Chelsea's mother.<eos> Are you ready for the big day?<eos> The wedding.
No.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm going to call my sponsor, okay?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just because he had a room key and was wearing a shirt you bought Brad, that doesn't mean anything.<eos> I mean, guys trade clothes in hotel rooms all the time.<eos> Maybe it was chilly, you know what I mean?<eos> Maybe they called up each other...<eos> "Hey, man, I'm freezing."<eos> "Me, too.
You're not gonna come to me.<eos> You're gonna go to your fucking bachelor party!<eos> You can still make this right, Dre.<eos> I'm an alcoholic.<eos> I'm a fucking drunk.<eos> Do you really think I need to go to a party?<eos> You have to do this.<eos> Did you forget who the fuck I am?<eos> I turned down Bradley Cooper!<eos> Matt Kemp!

What was I supposed to do, let you get locked up by yourself?<eos> Dre, next time they give you one call, call me.<eos> Here's what you are going to do.<eos> You are going to attend your bachelor party.<eos> And then you're going to climb up on that jet and you, my man, are going to get married.<eos> And then, and only then, I will make sure that your little incident plays into the press like it was part of the show.<eos> I will tell the media, the cops, your parole officer, that we all thought the alcohol was fake.<eos> Everybody knows that these shows aren't real.<eos> But if you decide to do something drastic, you are on your own.<eos> Your own.
You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say will be taken down in a court of law.<eos> You can't.<eos> Yeah, I can.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> Yeah, I just did it.<eos> - Honey, you still awake?<eos> -Yeah...<eos> I really like the role play thing.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Tell him I spat on it, there's spit everywhere, it's as slippery as fuck.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> He wants to...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He wants to put his penis in you... your vagina.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> - Your wet vagina.<eos> Mmm, oh, fuck, yeah.<eos> Oh,I 'mdrippingwet.<eos> Oh,thatfeelsgood.
And you have a nude scene...<eos> Touch their boobs.<eos> Mm.<eos> Then you get to move on, do the same thing all over again somewhere else.<eos> [Sighs] Seems like a really great life.<eos> The life I'm trying to lead for myself.<eos> Sure.<eos> Bet you fuck a lot of actresses, huh?<eos> I'm sorry, what is this supposed to be about again?<eos> You. The...
No, honey.<eos> We chum the waters, wait for the fish to bite.<eos> First stage.<eos> Here we go!<eos> Tear it up, y'all.<eos> Ready, set, step!<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Debbie.<eos> Matty.

Good.<eos> You?<eos> Good.<eos> You're pregnant?<eos> How is that even possible?<eos> Well, that's what I said.<eos> We can't afford to have two babies.<eos> We're barely gonna be able to afford to have one.<eos> Have you told Kev yet?<eos> What about your mom?
Please don't kill me!<eos> Mr. Rapoport, I am Sook-yin Park.<eos> The Supreme Leader will grant a one-hour interview to Mr. Skylark from inside North Korea.<eos> All questions will be supplied by the Supreme Leader himself.<eos> Terms are nonnegotiable.<eos> You have 24 hours to decide.<eos> - That's it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Why didn't you guys tell me this over the phone?<eos> Or Skype?
So, uh, how can we, uh, what can we do you for?<eos> - Yeah, to what do we owe the pleasure? - AARON: Yeah.<eos> Well, Aaron, Dave, as I'm sure you know already, Kim Jong-un is now capable of nuking all of the West Coast.<eos> The point is we're talking about nuclear nations at war with each other.<eos> Nuclear.<eos> He does have one tactical advantage over the West.<eos> He's more than willing to let millions and millions of his own people die.<eos> Ba-bam.<eos> Explosions.<eos> All over my face.
I fucked up.<eos> I just...<eos> I like something wild.<eos> I always did. I just...<eos> it feels like it... It smoothes out the other parts of my life most of...<eos> Listen, Marty, one more time.<eos> It's none of my fuckin' business.<eos> Ah, fuck.<eos> Look, we got a job to do.<eos> Off-book.
I embrace the outlaw life.<eos> Now, you dress the part still.<eos> That just an act?<eos> When in Rome, brother, but I do clean up real fuckin' pretty.<eos> Motherfucker, I need a gunslinger.<eos> Now, you ain't too timid, get on this shit with me.<eos> Then we can talk about doin' business.<eos> Where?<eos> My place.<eos> Down the bayou.
There's plenty of news stories if you care to find them.<eos> I got promoted to detective sergeant.<eos> Rust got a commendation for bravery, basically because I insisted, and things were pretty good for a while, I guess.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get your speed up.<eos> Ooh. All right.<eos> Maggie came around.<eos> Just, you know, a lot of talking, counseling, and maybe being in a shootout kind of opened her up to forgiveness or the possibility.<eos> Right to the wall.<eos> Right to the wall.

It's been weeks since I left my mark.<eos> Would that they had eyes to see.<eos> Hey!<eos> Don't you get Miss Billie in here with them dirty feet!<eos> Sorry, old chap.<eos> You want to make flowers today?<eos> Now, Betty, I have very important work to do.<eos> My... ascension removes me from the disc and the loop.<eos> I'm near final stage.<eos> Some mornings,
- Yeah.<eos> Uh... OK.<eos> Business license not renewed since 2004.<eos> OK.<eos> Name comes up a lot in public records.<eos> Looks like they had a lot of parish contracts.<eos> Public, state property, landscape, yeah.<eos> That's what I want. I want to know where he was.<eos> OK.<eos> All over the coast, OK?
No, not exactly.<eos> I respect the work that they have done... But we just need to know when it's time to innovate.<eos> Most of our pyramid is buried deep beneath the desert.<eos> Here is a scan.<eos> Look at the size of that thing!<eos> That's got to be 600 feet on each side.<eos> See this tunnel here?<eos> This is our way in.<eos> It leads directly to the apex of the pyramid.<eos> The apex?
Dagny, all of your life, you've heard people saying... that we have to help the less fortunate, that the measure of virtue is... Is not what you achieve, but what you do for others.<eos> You've heard them say... that people have a right to a living just because they're human.<eos> And that's not the right to earn a living, that is a right to a living, which you are required to provide for them.<eos> Now, do you see any common themes here?<eos> Need of others paramount, your needs secondary?<eos> Their philosophy is based on how much you sacrifice to other people, not on what you achieve.<eos> That philosophy can't work.<eos> Unless you continue to work and work and work and work... and try to overcome all the obstacles which they have created for you.<eos> And no matter how much they take from you, they still count on your work ethic, your integrity, your desire to keep producing.<eos> But I...
The national survival requires...<eos> What is the plan?<eos> What does it do?<eos> Every railroad in the country has been unified into a single team. Pooling their resources.<eos> You've nationalized the railroad.<eos> No skin off your back.<eos> Cuffy.<eos> Cuffy, please.<eos> Dagny, under the act, all of the gross revenue will be turned over... to the Railroad Pool Board in Washington... where it will then be distributed on a more modern principle of distribution...<eos> What principle?
Well,<eos> I'm always open to a deal.<eos> I knew it!<eos> I knew it!<eos> I told those theorizers of mine.<eos> I'm always open to a deal with anyone who has a value to offer me.<eos> Well, then, hell, write your own ticket.<eos> What are you offering?<eos> Anything you want.<eos> Such as?
We can get a fresh sample to you.<eos> I'd prefer that.<eos> Eliminate any possibility of contamination.<eos> Isaac would like to pay what they want to make this go away.<eos> They gave you details of how to make the transaction?<eos> Your son was difficult to control.<eos> He didn't react well to strangers.<eos> He hit out at them?<eos> Yeah, and might try to bite them if he was very, very scared.<eos> And to you?
Mr Rashid's dead.<eos> He's dead?<eos> He was killed a few days ago, apparently trying to pay a blackmailer who's been dead a week.<eos> Charge him or release him.<eos> Take him back to his cell.<eos> Eva Liron worked for Adam Freedman's family.<eos> She worked for him and his wife for two months and then quit unexpectedly.<eos> He doesn't know why.<eos> She just left.<eos> Well, same pattern.
He ain't joking.<eos> You should go.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> If you're looking for another rent boy, they're on the corner of Smith street.<eos> Manners... maketh... man.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> Then let me teach you a lesson.<eos> Are we going to stand around here all day, or are we going to fight?<eos> You fucking dirty, fucking dirty...<eos> Sorry about that.
For God's sake, I've barely touched you.<eos> Man up!<eos> Fucking hell!<eos> That is rank, Harry.<eos> You blew up his head?<eos> It's a bit much, innit?<eos> Actually, the explosion was caused by an implant in his neck.<eos> Here, under the scar.<eos> Did my hardware pick up the signal that triggered it?<eos> Fortunately, yes.
And I hope not to be scraping one of you up.<eos> But if I do have to, and you're inside the target... please know I'll be very impressed.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - Oh, shit!<eos> Everybody listen, I've got a plan!<eos> Pair off!<eos> Grab the closest person to them.<eos> Rufus, come on!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Rufus!
Who's Mrs. Barlow?<eos> Ah.<eos> You've heard the stories, haven't you?<eos> She's a witch who pledged my soul to the devil and anoints me with the blood of infants to keep me safe in battle.<eos> - Come on, I'm not stupid.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> So you can probably guess it isn't as much fun to tell stories about how your captain makes a home with a nice Puritan woman who shares his love of books.<eos> Is that the truth?<eos> Sails!<eos> Man your posts!

Beauclerc, do it!<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> Bring us to starboard before we lose the wind!<eos> - Mr. Harris, take the helm!<eos> - Aye, sir!<eos> Fire.<eos> We've lost the wind, Captain.<eos> Prepare to repel boarders!<eos> Bring us around to the port side!<eos> On the rails!

Why would I do that?<eos> I'm trying to protect both you and I.<eos> I'm not facing prison.<eos> You didn't cover up the arrest?<eos> Was it because you wanted him to be governor?<eos> No.<eos> He was in trouble so I helped.<eos> And later he expressed a desire to run<eos> - and I offered guidance.<eos> - To an alcoholic?
There's nothing I can do.<eos> The assistant district attorney...<eos> Bullshit.<eos> She works for you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you innocent?<eos> Is that what you're telling me?<eos> I hurt you. I know that.<eos> No, Carrie.<eos> Not me, all of us.
Please, she's a good girl.<eos> Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.<eos> I know you.<eos> You're the Hound.<eos> Pour our new friend some ale.<eos> What brings you so far north?<eos> I could ask the same of you.<eos> What are you doing up here?<eos> Just keeping the king's peace.<eos> No need.
- Yes, and he already has one.<eos> Coffee over here? Anyone?<eos> Come.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Stop!<eos> If you're going out like that, then there's nothing I can do for you.<eos> Marie.<eos> No. Marie! Come here!<eos> Marie!<eos> Bye, bye.
Have fun! You can fight but don't wreck the place.<eos> Knock that off!<eos> What line of work was your dad in?<eos> Had to be a loser, right?<eos> A loser?<eos> Is he abusive to you?<eos> Piece of crap, right?<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> Huh?<eos> Ogisu!
He helps his dad run a grill. Kazeo... You're not the only one.<eos> Everyone's dysfunctional. So I was thinking maybe it's time... you relaxed and made some friends. Korean barbecue, man.<eos> At Goro's grill, we eat for free! Picture curling a strip of marinated beef loin around a pillow of rice...<eos> Ow!<eos> You guys hang out a lot?<eos> Yeah. Why?<eos> How come?<eos> 'Cause there's nobody at home. And hanging with them is way more fun.<eos> Oh. When you go home, it's just you, right?<eos> Ogisu!
Stop being a wimp!<eos> Damn you.<eos> A guy with your life would never understand... what it's like to rise from a dung heap. How it feels to bow and scrape for a living. An outcast feeding in crumbs, always starting from scratch.<eos> Hey! You freshmen better not be picking a fight with a senior.<eos> Cut the bull, peon.<eos> What's 2 years? - Come again, punk?<eos> - Don't come back!<eos> Hey, Kazeo!<eos> Beat him to death! Always standing ahead of me. You're an eyesore!<eos> You okay, Ogisu?
You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.<eos> In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace.<eos> More than once.<eos> Did he?<eos> Haven't heard that story before.<eos> Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.<eos> I'm sure you have many fascinating stories.<eos> Sworn to Renly Baratheon.<eos> Sworn to Catelyn Stark.<eos> And now my brother.
No one's building a vampire army.<eos> We've barely got enough for a bocce game.<eos> We're just trying to get back to status quo.<eos> You were right the first time.<eos> I don't wanna be involved.<eos> But Sapp Sons?<eos> Really?<eos> Well, you have to admit, it's really the cleanest way.<eos> There's nothing wrong with a funeral home, but that particular one, everyone that's ever owned it is dead.<eos> - Except for you.

Fucking bastards.<eos> No fucking longer.<eos> Two hours.<eos> Two fucking hours she's been holed up in there.<eos> Well, I for one think this is a good sign.<eos> What?<eos> Clearly she's taking the decision seriously.<eos> I'm sorry, you think it's a good sign she's taking this seriously?<eos> I can't even-<eos> - Jesus.
What were you doing in my room?<eos> I was looking for make-up for your mum.<eos> You haven't told her, have you?<eos> Listen, it's not about the drugs.<eos> It's about whoever it was who nearly killed your mother.<eos> It's over.<eos> I haven't used since she got bashed.<eos> You realise you could go to jail for conspiracy, don't you?<eos> I told this bloke that my mum did big money bets.<eos> What bloke?
No.<eos> Easy. OK.<eos> So, fly, fly, fly, out over the lake.<eos> Then how do you off-load the unconscious man?<eos> I guess... lock in a slight circular bank.<eos> Lean over the body, open the door...<eos> Then just push the body out.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So, Gavin, has business been bad for a while?<eos> Up and down.
If you fall, they'll come after the Lyell.<eos> Ah, so, I am a firewall.<eos> Come and have a look at this a second?<eos> It's THESE marks.<eos> Did you notice this before?<eos> No.<eos> Same on Charlie Masham.<eos> Look at his eye.<eos> What does that tell you?<eos> Asphyxiation.
But as an extra precaution, I want your men to be watching the Duke at all times.<eos> Won't he object?<eos> There's just been an attempt on his life - he can hardly protest at our efforts to protect him.<eos> So, Monsieur Marsac, I assume you're a soldier?<eos> Not at all.<eos> He's a...cabinet-maker.<eos> Cabinet-maker?<eos> Highly skilled.<eos> Of course, that's exactly what I am, an artist in, er, oak, walnut, chestnut...<eos> Chestnut?
Do what you have to do.<eos> One condition - Marsac stays under house arrest.<eos> During the massacre, I wounded their leader, a cut across the back.<eos> If it was the Duke who led the attack, he'll still carry the scar.<eos> Aramis, before you go down this road, ask yourself one question.<eos> If it is true, what then?<eos> He's a precocious little darling, isn't he?<eos> Louis Amadeus, careful.<eos> Oh, let him do his worst. I need the practice.<eos> Ha-ha! Now, careful.
Yes.<eos> I never thought I'd say it, but yes.<eos> Well, you buck up, and I will find that whiskey.<eos> I don't know if you can hear me and I haven't always led an exemplary life.<eos> I've not only been a skeptic, a non-believer, but been much worse...<eos> A man with contempt for... For people who give themselves over to the idea that... That there's some kind of benevolent father figure up there.<eos> I've always said it was childish, wishful thinking, strictly for primitives, all these, all these hopes about a...<eos> A purpose for life, a larger meaning.<eos> That all our suffering will somehow accrue to some...<eos> Greater plan.
All right, deal.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Okay, dip into graphics.<eos> I don't think that's going to cover it.<eos> Frank, it's not my call.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> I have video footage.<eos> - Down the hall, to the right.
It looks like a silk shirt.<eos> - Maybe a woman's silk blouse.<eos> - It's just so sad.<eos> Stand by to dissolve, Two.<eos> ...obviously, there is the second body.<eos> - They've escaped. - The person or people who committed all of this brutal home invasion robbery, they're presently unidentified and at large, still on the streets.<eos> - Hit it again. Harder.<eos> - This has got to be a huge worry not only to the residents in this neighborhood, Granada Hills area as well.<eos> All of Los Angeles, if you think about it.<eos> Yeah, the entire Southland, really.
What am I now?<eos> You're an assistant.<eos> That's... Big.<eos> - Does it come with a raise?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> How much?<eos> Pick a number.<eos> You pick a number.<eos> A... $75 a night?<eos> Agreed.
Well, thank you!<eos> It's cool, relax.<eos> You're late, guys.<eos> Come and join us.<eos> You can have my spikes.<eos> No, it's OK.<eos> I have to go to the store.<eos> I'm running out of smokes.<eos> - What an athlete.<eos> - Exactly!
Will you show it to me?<eos> If you want.<eos> Ouch!<eos> There.<eos> One more?<eos> - I don't have any more.<eos> - You don't?<eos> - I like that.<eos> - I put some honey on it.<eos> - With the brush?
- Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> This is funny.<eos> It's... strange.<eos> Find me.<eos> Whoa, what?<eos> We are in the middle of two floors.<eos> We stopped.<eos> We should call the super.<eos> - The super what? - The super.
- Yeah, of course.<eos> This is funny.<eos> It's... strange.<eos> Find me.<eos> Whoa, what?<eos> We are in the middle of two floors.<eos> We stopped.<eos> We should call the super.<eos> - The super what? - The super.<eos> The superintendant.
I swear by the health of General Eanes.<eos> And we got rid of the fascist ten years ago and you have the nerve to tell me what I can't do?<eos> Are you gonna ask me for the permit to the lighter?<eos> Can you prove that we're in the year two thousand and...<eos> What did he say? Two thousand and...<eos> Two thousand thirteen.<eos> I'll be dead in two thousand thirteen!<eos> How can I prove that to you?<eos> Go and lookfor a newspaper or something.<eos> A newspaper?
That's life, the good and the bad.<eos> You went through some bad and ugly things in your life, things you saw and wish you didn't, but there's nothing you can do about it now.<eos> You see?<eos> So the important thing is from now on.<eos> What do you want to do with your life?<eos> I don't know...<eos> This is ruined.<eos> Go take a long bath and I'll get dinner ready, olC?<eos> You miss him, don't you?<eos> Whom?

- Nothing?<eos> - Nope, not a twitch.<eos> I even tossed his salad for a second or three.<eos> Kid lives for fucking ass play.<eos> You think this is maybe psychological?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - All I know is that it was like sucking on a little hotdog wrapped in foreskin.<eos> And the more I sucked, the smaller it got.<eos> It felt wrong, like I was blowing a baby.<eos> A big, bald, unemployable baby.
Even when they say you can on the Internet, it's...<eos> - Hey, can you just...<eos> - What's up?<eos> A hair appointment just opened up for me if we can get there in five minutes.<eos> - I thought we were hanging out.<eos> - We are hanging out.<eos> - I have to be back in one hour. - Don't worry.<eos> She's fast.<eos> Come on, smile. Don't be a sourpuss.<eos> All right, y'all. Ready for your big day?
I see your value now.<eos> - Abed, why? - "I see your value now."<eos> It's a callback to when we met first season.<eos> And me calling years "seasons" is a callback to my first season dialogue, and me calling...<eos> Abed, I know what makes you off-putting, but why are you here?<eos> The Dean called me about the Save Greendale Committee.<eos> - Can I join? - Well, I...<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Who else did he call?<eos> - Just me.
No, I'm looking at the money right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> Okay, load that thing up.<eos> We'll go out this afternoon.<eos> You're the best.<eos> - You talking to me or the fish?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Fish probably.
He's dead.<eos> That's what he wants everyone to think.<eos> I was very clear.<eos> Tonight I have to be out of pocket.<eos> It's my mother's birthday.<eos> Bo is at St. Ann's hospital on the eighth floor.<eos> Call me when you have her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> [Woman speaking french]<eos> [Cheers and applause]
Skouras is closing in.<eos> I can't believe you used to be partners with that guy.<eos> Well, the past is a very tricky place, my dear.<eos> We'll have to move them from town to town.<eos> Well, that's incredibly risky.<eos> But let's look on the bright side.<eos> Think of all the people she'll help along the way.<eos> But you put her with a death row inmate.<eos> No, I put her...<eos> With her father.
You wouldn't want this to fall into the wrong hands.<eos> Well, gentlemen, Paris it is.<eos> Oh, um, grant me one last favour before we go.<eos> A few moments alone with my wife.<eos> You must think we're stupid.<eos> Terribly sorry, apparently we are.<eos> I must have your guarantee that you won't try to escape, monsieur.<eos> You have my word on it... ..as a gentleman.<eos> Bonnaire's admirers have gone.<eos> For now, at least.
I don't do that sort of thing.<eos> Take direct action like that.<eos> We don't. We just acquire information and disseminate it.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> You make it sound like what you do is benign. We both know it isn't.<eos> Do we?<eos> Get started, Chloe.<eos> I don't want to be here any longer than I have to.<eos> Pete, make sure the others have access to the closed- circuit surveillance system from the London transport.<eos> Uh, okay, which ones?

Get out, Jack. Get out of there now.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to get into the embassy.<eos> They're shooting at us!<eos> They're shooting at us!<eos> Help!<eos> Bauer!<eos> The following takes place between 2:00 P.M. and 3:00 P.M.<eos> No more drones!<eos> No more drones!

Imagine this happening here in London when Margot Al-Harazi gets control of ten drones.<eos> Think of the people that will die.<eos> I'm not really seeing your point.<eos> - I am trying to help.<eos> - My point is that the marines think that Jack is a threat.<eos> They're going to kill him, along with any chance we have of stopping this.<eos> So if you can think of a better way to convince the government that Jack is telling the truth, then tell me now.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me, too.
Well, at least he's alive.<eos> Listen, I have the flight key.<eos> What do you need me to do to get you the rest of this data?<eos> Get to a computer with a 4G network, I'll walk you through the rest.<eos> Okay, copy that.<eos> I'll call you when I'm ready.<eos> I can't believe you're in one piece.<eos> What the hell happened in there?<eos> I managed to stop them from killing Bauer.<eos> No more drones!

Go.<eos> Jack, you'll have to take out two guards on the port side.<eos> There are men on the bridge.<eos> They're moving away.<eos> You're good.<eos> Clear. Go.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Synchronized shot.<eos> I've acquired target on the left, you take target on the right.<eos> On my count.
I don't really like knives.<eos> She likes double-edged throwers.<eos> Fast hands.<eos> Bought one the other day.<eos> - Where can I find her?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> All right.<eos> Down by the cliffs.<eos> Sunset and La Brea.<eos> Hey.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> Look, not on me, of course.<eos> In a safe place.<eos> Lie to me again, I'll add your jondra to my collection.<eos> Put that gunya ganchi in the ground!<eos> Where do I get me one of them neat ponchos?<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> I hope you enjoyed your stay, sir.<eos> I relish these little trips to the ass end of nowhere.<eos> Hey!
- I really should be getting back.<eos> - I'm not mad.<eos> I'm just running!<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> Stop!<eos> - This is my motherfucking meat.<eos> - Take it easy, lady.<eos> - Where the fuck did he think he was going in a suit like that'?<eos> - Anyone see the vehicle hit the victim?<eos> - Jesus Christ.
Shit.<eos> Ok.<eos> Come on, get your shit together, you silly tit.<eos> I need you to make a side trip for me, yeah?<eos> Please just... Come to the Dyad event.<eos> Hey, think what you're asking me to do.<eos> We can negotiate your position, but you need to start talking to Leekie.<eos> - We need the Dyad now.<eos> - We?<eos> You.
Why don't I talk to them, Sarah?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Just sit tight, ok?<eos> I'll feel better when I have a gun.<eos> This is totally crazy.<eos> - Morning, Mrs. Hendrix.<eos> - Hello, Ramon.<eos> Did I catch you on a break?<eos> Oh, customer service never takes a break at Econo-mart.<eos> So, uh... Avomax?
I only have seven, eight months rent necessary, then I'm going to make a profit.<eos> My business is good.<eos> You have to look at it...<eos> Mr. Kelly, we borrow any more money to small businesses.<eos> What do you do?<eos> Never mind, I'm sorry.<eos> I am excited and wants to be just a little red.<eos> I can not believe this thing still exists.<eos> Two Jamesons, for me and my brother.<eos> My brother.
If you have a girlfriend and get driving herein she finds you great.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - I'm at work, I can not.<eos> Then time.<eos> We should go.<eos> Jiffy.<eos> Burnell, take over, I'm back.<eos> Who steals a yellow car now?<eos> It is well with my green jacket.<eos> And the brown.
- You don't have anyone with you?<eos> - No, it's just me.<eos> - Hi, Malin? Welcome. - Oh, excuse me!<eos> - Are we waiting for someone? - No, it's just me.<eos> - Should I phone someone?<eos> - There's no one to phone.<eos> - Just don't pity me.<eos> - I don't.<eos> I'm Malin too, a midwife.<eos> Down the hall.
And we'll just see what she has to say.<eos> Officer meyer... I really appreciate this.<eos> Can i help you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> What do you do here exactly?<eos> Well, people come here to take pictures.<eos> You can bring your own equipment, or we can rent you some.<eos> But we rent you the room, and we provide the models.<eos> There's no pissing, and there's no screwing.<eos> You interested?
You'll come back soon, right?<eos> As soon as I can.<eos> I have to take care of something first.<eos> Don't forget me in here.<eos> I may have to be away for a while.<eos> O.K. Call me.<eos> - I'm sorry, young man.<eos> Time's up.<eos> - O.K.<eos> Between 7:00 and 9:00 on Wednesday.
Simon, who are you with these days?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Fay, you have a visitor.<eos> Please have a seat.<eos> My name is Daniel.<eos> Reverend Gardner.<eos> Ned may have mentioned me to you.<eos> Yes.<eos> If I may say so, Fay, Ned is like a son to me.<eos> Me too.
This decision, as it were, by God, is uncontingent and eternal, rather than temporally or ontologically sequential.<eos> - Mmm...<eos> - What?<eos> Do you think that's the right word?<eos> Temporally?<eos> No, ontologically.<eos> What do you suggest?<eos> It's just that the nature of being is already the subject of the passage itself.<eos> I think you should move on from the idea of temporality to something more materially concrete.<eos> Spatiality, right.
- Maya?<eos> Wow, it sounds like a fancy bird.<eos> You seem like a very nice lady.<eos> Unfortunately, Tom's an idiot.<eos> Maya is not a very nice lady.<eos> It's comming!<eos> Maya was born in 1984 in the front seat of her father's pickup truck.<eos> She had her first beer one minute later.<eos> She was the third of six girls.<eos> Unfortunately...
We should press the Bowmans.<eos> Okay. They might know more than they're saying.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Or...<eos> Or what?<eos> We should talk to the kids.<eos> If Solomon is hiding, one of his buddies might know where.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Yeah, and I should talk to them.<eos> Alone.
Okay, well, I'll wait for Brock.<eos> You get back to Meg. He's gonna be here in, like, five minutes.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Just try to get some rest, sweetheart.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Promise.<eos> - All right.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Well, you have a good night.<eos> - You, too.
I'm looking for Matt Sharp.<eos> I'm Sharp.<eos> Irony.<eos> Nice.<eos> I need to talk to you for a minute.<eos> I'm on the clock, Sheriff.<eos> I don't know if you heard, but the market's down, unemployment's at 9%.<eos> You wouldn't want to keep an honest man from making a buck, would ya?<eos> An honest man, no.<eos> You?
I always hated the parquet floors in our East Side place. Uh-huh.<eos> Who came up with the idea of parquet, anyway?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's like walking on a board game.<eos> RUTH:<eos> I know.<eos> This is the bathroom.<eos> Only one?<eos> I told you that, honey.<eos> Jesus. Yeah.
Oh, Mrs. Carver, I'm Annie. Annie Meyer.<eos> Hello.<eos> Well, you know, we have a dog.<eos> He's not here now.<eos> Well, no. She's in the hospital. She's recovering from surgery.<eos> Oh, n...<eos> Oh! Whoa!<eos> Harold, Harold!<eos> Stop, Harold.<eos> Heel!

(WHIMPERING)<eos> Let me tell you.<eos> What?<eos> Once I give them this check...<eos> Yeah.<eos> ...there's no turning back.<eos> I know.<eos> Everything is different.<eos> Good different, honey.<eos> Good different.
And, like most rides, we ended up where we began.<eos> Still, it reminded us who we are.<eos> What we have.<eos> It was worth it, if only for that.<eos> Maybe one day we'll sell.<eos> Stop climbing the stairs.<eos> But for now we'll just deal with what is.<eos> The important thing is it brought us back here.<eos> Together.<eos> Back to our senses.

Please, Lucy.<eos> You must tell me what's going on.<eos> I know I'm not as sophisticated or modern as Jayne Wetherby, but...<eos> I'm not a complete fool.<eos> Darling...<eos> Please tell me.<eos> - Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - Tell you what?<eos> That it's perfectly natural for a woman to fall in love with another woman.<eos> To what?
Do you love me?<eos> - Don't ask me that.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have something that I have to finish, and until I do, I cannot move forward.<eos> The resonator.<eos> Yes, but that's only the smallest part.<eos> I owe that someone that I used to love a terrible debt, and until it's paid in full...<eos> I can't.<eos> Besides...
They come with us.<eos> They can be useful.<eos> They're going to kill us...<eos> I don't know.<eos> The French are in Ait Kermane.<eos> The French are coming.<eos> We're going back to Tamazg ha.<eos> Slimane...<eos> Slimanel<eos> Daru?
My responsibility is to provide safe and timely passage of goods and products into and around this city.<eos> And because of this situation, it is appearing to those, whose opinions I care about, that I can't do my job.<eos> That can not and will not continue.<eos> I-I-I'm not even sure what you're suggesting.<eos> Are you kidding me with this?<eos> No.<eos> Every driver in your fleet gets a handgun.<eos> - And a permit? - Mm-hmm.<eos> When?<eos> By Friday.
Jimmy, could you give us a minute?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Abel!<eos> That was well-said last night.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I'm just here to collect that check that you owe me.<eos> What check is that?<eos> The one for $213,000.<eos> That funny?
Mapleton would tell him, but she's too busy stealing for herself.<eos> - Idelle!<eos> Downstairs.<eos> - Customer.<eos> All I'm saying is get in while the getting's good.<eos> Jesus!<eos> The fuck did they do to you?<eos> Postelection initiation, I'm told.<eos> All done in good fun.<eos> At least...
- He doesn't know what he heard.<eos> - Get the quartermaster in here.<eos> Right now.<eos> Bear with me.<eos> One minute, please.<eos> Uh, apologies. Give me it.<eos> Ah! Here it is.<eos> It is with great pleasure that we shall now commence our inaugural meeting of the Guthrie Frasier Naft Lawrence Consortium for the Purposes of Shipping and Trade in the West Indies, Excelsior.<eos> Reginald, add to the agenda discussion of a shorter name.<eos> Jesus.
Bring it back Monday at five.<eos> That's right, back to work Tuesday.<eos> - Need a map?<eos> - No, I'm good.<eos> You don't want a map?<eos> No. No.<eos> I know this park well.<eos> It's kinda end of the season, right?<eos> I mean the weather can change on you.. Just turn on a dime.<eos> Less people.
The pump of the heart.<eos> The circular flush of the blood.<eos> But what is the role of women in this age of wonder?<eos> Your menfolk will tell you that an education is a danger to your "fragile" mind.<eos> My women of Paris, seek your own enlightenment!<eos> God gave you life, not man.<eos> It is your Christian duty to live this life to its fullest.<eos> Was it an attempt on my life?<eos> The young woman merely wanted to present this petition to the Queen.<eos> To me?
And I advise you not to ask ridiculous questions.<eos> Fleur Baudin!<eos> Come forward.<eos> Just do the right thing, all right?<eos> All will be well if you tell the truth, child.<eos> What happened to you at the Comtesse's salon?<eos> May I have a drink of water?<eos> Answer my question.<eos> Er...the Comtesse taught us things.<eos> What things?
You can't move on without first attaining the previous form.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I cracked many cases without knowing martial arts.<eos> Knowing martials arts doesn't mean you can solve a case.<eos> Give me another reason.<eos> Tung Ching-ting, Tarn King-yiu, Cho Chi-on,<eos> Yuen Ching-yeung, Fong Man-hei, Fu Sing-tai, Fong Luk-tak, one of these seven men will be the next victim.<eos> Sit down!<eos> Dig up everything you can about all 8 of them.<eos> 8?
6 years ago, this man showed up to challenge me and we fought.<eos> He beat me in the end and left behind this Eaves Swallow.<eos> He had an unusual name, it sounded ancient.<eos> It's Fung Yu-sau.<eos> He was born with an atrophied left leg, his legs are of different lengths as well as different strengths.<eos> Overcoming the handicap through practice, his achievement is rather inconceivable.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> He lives with his wife on...<eos> Sui Kwai Lane.<eos> Madam.
Last night's case became a showbiz headline!<eos> How much time do you still need to wrap this up?<eos> Sir, I have a very important lead...<eos> Leads are useless.<eos> I want to close file!<eos> Just like in a soccer game, passing the ball without shooting for the goal will never win the game.<eos> I want to know when you can crack the case.<eos> Give me 72 hours.<eos> 3 days later, you better make the headlines.<eos> Sorry!
Let's go over there now!<eos> Don't go!<eos> We're on our way over!<eos> Officers in the water, we need the Lantau Marine Police.<eos> Come on!<eos> Intercept him before he leaves the typhoon shelter.<eos> I'm not his accomplice.<eos> I can explain everything.<eos> I admit he came to see me in jail.<eos> Madam.
That's not what I meant.<eos> So you...you didn't go to the chemist specially?<eos> The whisky was already in the house as well, wasn't it, Sarah?<eos> That proves that you didn't plan it.<eos> And you gave her the whisky after you connected the drip?<eos> To calm her down.<eos> Then I sat with her.<eos> And when she was gone... ..I called the police.<eos> Immediately?<eos> And your husband?
And Jo?<eos> The counsellor helped her greatly.<eos> And it was your idea to go to the St Jude's Centre for a counsellor?<eos> Sarah and I agreed it would be a good idea for Jo to talk to someone with expertise.<eos> I am a practising Catholic.<eos> I asked our priest for advice.<eos> And you believed that, by last September, Jo was in a better frame of mind?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Nor had Sarah come round to supporting the view that Jo might want to take her own life?<eos> Not to the best of my knowledge, no.
I want you to pay off your debt.<eos> If I become Head of Chambers, I'll need strong women at the Bar.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> This is your big chance.<eos> Take this witness.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> The accused was arrested approaching his car.<eos> Where was that?<eos> Hounslow West tube station, a couple of stops from Heathrow on the Piccadilly line.<eos> - The blue line.
I'm after something more than legacy.<eos> What's that?<eos> Atonement.<eos> Also known as grassing people up.<eos> Atonement means a lot more than the codes of honour that bad people make for themselves.<eos> Grassing up bad people is good.<eos> Not grassing up bad people is lawyering.<eos> There are no grasses in hell, Billy.<eos> So what do you want from me, then?<eos> Martha Costello.
Methadone, yeah...<eos> Er... why did you fail to appear at court last time?<eos> Um... too ill.<eos> When was the last time?<eos> The 16th at Camberwell Green?<eos> Right.<eos> My methadone.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I need a doctor.<eos> Christopher Rankin.
I think it's important that we get that clear.<eos> And of all the women in that bar, she was the one you wanted to have sex with?<eos> The slurring, drunk, weepy one, who smelled of vomit?<eos> No, no, it wasn't like that.<eos> She was drunk, OK...<eos> And you chose her because of her drunken state, not despite it.<eos> She wasn't attractive, she was a mess.<eos> But she was vulnerable, and because of that, you hunted her down and you raped her, didn't you, Mr Flinders?<eos> Um... Your Honour.<eos> Madam.
Not all Chelsea supporters are wilfully blind.<eos> Manchester City play very attractive football in a very attractive kit... and are still everyone's second-favourite team.<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> I love it, you know, how deep you go, how much passion and conviction you put into everything you do... when you've got a wig on.<eos> I want you to listen very carefully... ..and when I'm finished, I don't want you to say anything.<eos> You elbowed Dean Trent in the face, because you'd had enough of him and everything he stood for.<eos> There might have been a dangerous tackle coming your way, but that's not why you hit out.<eos> It's bigger than that.<eos> You hit out at the prejudice, ignorance and the silence that football demands from you.<eos> In law...
I wanted to tell you I'm having a lovely time with Jekyll and Hyde.<eos> Oh. It's just so gruesome in a really good way.<eos> Oh, I'm... I'm happy you're enjoying it.<eos> I'm happy you're back teaching.<eos> So am I.<eos> Spencer and Emily think you're the best.<eos> So does Aria.<eos> I'm a little envious.<eos> "Envious"?<eos> Of the other girls.
Mostly that's what Avery does now.<eos> They keep adjusting her meds.<eos> It just gets worse the longer Sara's gone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sure Alison was a great person.<eos> But Sara wasn't.<eos> She was pretty, and poised, and perfect.<eos> And... everything she gave you, she took two things away.<eos> I... I can't talk like this to the others, but I'm saying it to you.<eos> Why me?
I don't sit back there.<eos> The doors don't work.<eos> - Well, you can't do that.<eos> - She just did.<eos> Pony Wayne White?<eos> Yeah, I know that name.<eos> I just did an autopsy on him last week, but this says he's been dead for two months.<eos> That can't be right, can it?<eos> I mean, I think I'd notice if a body had been dead for two months.<eos> The smell alone, yeah.
Praise be to the God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comforts, who comforts us through all our afflictions so that we can comfort those in any afflictions,<eos> We come together today to say farewell...<eos> Shut up, fucking pedophile.<eos> She did her best to be there for all those in her life.<eos> Her son, her family.

Sorry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I have one?<eos> Please?<eos> Vincent, would you please leave us alone for a minute?<eos> I need to talk to Marie about her little stunt in the lunch room.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... if you could go anywhere in the world... where would you go?<eos> Um...<eos> The ocean.
Look out!<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Jesus. That was deliberate, wasn't it?<eos> ! Where is she?<eos> We've got to find her.<eos> Stay by the door.<eos> Don't let her run for it.<eos> Someone was looking for something.<eos> Someone didn't find it.<eos> I...

- No way.<eos> - Do you live in Siena?<eos> - I've been here about six months.<eos> It's lovely.<eos> Do you need any actresses, by any chance?<eos> No. Not yet.<eos> But a guide.<eos> I want to see the real Siena.<eos> Do you work here every night?<eos> Most nights, not always.
Mr. Director.<eos> - You can call me Thomas.<eos> - 'Course.<eos> So, this is your comeback film.<eos> Hope so. How do you know?<eos> I looked you up on Siena's Burning.<eos> Do you know the blog?<eos> Yeah. Don't believe everything you read.<eos> 'Course.<eos> Only the good things.
This suits you.<eos> Chief?<eos> There's something you need to see.<eos> Our traps in the east lagoon... they're pulling up less and less fish.<eos> Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.<eos> We have.<eos> There's no fish.<eos> Oh. Then we'll fish the far side of the island.<eos> We tried.<eos> The windward side.
- I am Moana of...<eos> - Hero of men.<eos> What? It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter, demigod of the wind and sea... hero of men.<eos> I interrupted.<eos> From the top.<eos> Hero of men.<eos> Go.<eos> I am...<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry.<eos> And women.
What? It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter, demigod of the wind and sea... hero of men.<eos> I interrupted.<eos> From the top.<eos> Hero of men.<eos> Go.<eos> I am...<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry.<eos> And women.<eos> Men and women.<eos> Both. All.
I'm getting my hook.<eos> End of discussion.<eos> You'd be a hero.<eos> That's what you're all about, right?<eos> Little girl, I am a hero.<eos> Maybe you were.<eos> But now... now you're just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti.<eos> The guy who cursed the world.<eos> You're no one's hero.<eos> No one?
Mom?<eos> Help!<eos> No!<eos> Moana!<eos> Enjoy your beauty rest?<eos> You know, a real wayfinder never sleeps... so they actually get where they need to go.<eos> Muscle up, buttercup.<eos> We're here.<eos> You're sure this guy's gonna have your hook?<eos> Tamatoa?
- Yes, we will!<eos> - Turn around!<eos> - No!<eos> Moana, stop!<eos> No!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Maui?<eos> I told you to turn back.<eos> I thought we could make it.<eos> We?
- No, you will not.<eos> - You will stay right there.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> All couples have to be tied together.<eos> But we're not a couple.<eos> You sure looked like it on the beach.<eos> So, um, do you go to weddings a lot?<eos> Not my idea of a good time.<eos> Me neither.
There could be a job for a man like you.<eos> I already have a job.<eos> - What job?<eos> - You.<eos> Let the man pray.<eos> Here he comes.<eos> He's right below us.<eos> Bring up the net.<eos> Nothing in the net, sir.<eos> What the fuck?
Yeah. That's right.<eos> Now I've gotta go.<eos> Now I've gotta go.<eos> Everyone, evacuate!<eos> Billionaire Adrian Cook plunged 76 floors to his death this morning, when the glass pool of his Sydney penthouse collapsed.<eos> Although authorities...<eos> Give him his call.<eos> Okay.<eos> ...described his death as a tragic accident, effectively ruling out foul play.<eos> - Ready.
Lose your cell phone?<eos> I should've hired those guys from Houston.<eos> All right, what is it that you want to talk about?<eos> I want to help you avoid an accident.<eos> Krill, Cook, that was you.<eos> I warned those guys that one day Crain would come after all of us.<eos> Cappuccino?<eos> Espresso?<eos> Espresso.<eos> No sugar.
But I haven't put them to music yet.<eos> What kind of music are yous gonna be doing?<eos> Well, I-I don't know yet.<eos> What d'you mean you don't know?<eos> You have to know what you're gonna be playing.<eos> What are you into?<eos> I'm a futurist.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Like, uh, no nostalgia.<eos> Not like your da's band.
Of course.<eos> I'll be in your band.<eos> I'll play guitar.<eos> And I'll help write songs.<eos> We could rehearse here 'cause my da's in Saint John of Gods.<eos> - Is that a pub?<eos> - No, Darren.<eos> It's a place where alcoholics go to get off the drink, stop beating up their wives and kids.<eos> Right.<eos> And neighbors.
"Influences include Depeche Mode,<eos> Duran Duran and many more."<eos> - Faggots.<eos> - Piss off, Ryan.<eos> "Contact Management Solutions, 361 at St. Theresa's Gardens.<eos> No telephone, just call in."<eos> Sounds like a gig for us.<eos> Let's go.<eos> So what are we called, then?<eos> All right, what about...
"Contact Management Solutions, 361 at St. Theresa's Gardens.<eos> No telephone, just call in."<eos> Sounds like a gig for us.<eos> Let's go.<eos> So what are we called, then?<eos> All right, what about...<eos> The Rabbits?<eos> What's the story with you and rabbits?<eos> I don't know, I just love them.<eos> What about La Vie?
The Rabbits?<eos> What's the story with you and rabbits?<eos> I don't know, I just love them.<eos> What about La Vie?<eos> What's that mean?<eos> It's French for "The Life."<eos> What's French for, uh, "That's not gonna be the name of the band"?<eos> C'est nes pas le nom du groupe.<eos> There you go.<eos> What about...
I don't know.<eos> What's the song about, Conor?<eos> It's like when you don't know someone, they're more interesting.<eos> They can be anything you want them to be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But when you know them, there's limits to them.<eos> No, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> What's it called?<eos> "The Riddle of the Model."<eos> So what about a rhythm like this?
And, Ngig, I want to see you really pressing those keys.<eos> Here's some playback.<eos> Why don't we go eat these in the park?<eos> There you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Can I spin you home?<eos> I didn't know you had a car.<eos> So where d'you live?<eos> Not far from the school.
Think big, Conor.<eos> This is just a means to an end.<eos> And she looks amazing.<eos> She's got to be in all the videos.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> She's world-class.<eos> Without her, you're just a bunch of gay-looking kids down an alleyway.<eos> Have you kissed her yet?<eos> - No way.
I think she's having an affair.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> She gets a lift home from her boss a couple of times a week.<eos> She doesn't drive.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> She gets out of the car about 100 yards away from the house.<eos> It's a nervous thing.<eos> She's overcompensating.<eos> Good night, then.
Come on in here.<eos> I'm gonna go to class now.<eos> Jesus!<eos> You can't do this!<eos> Do you want to bet?<eos> I'll get you clean, don't worry.<eos> Clean you all up.<eos> Get all that shite off you.<eos> Take pride in your God-given features.<eos> No more Ziggy Stardust.
Take pride in your God-given features.<eos> No more Ziggy Stardust.<eos> - Hey, Cosmo.<eos> - Who?<eos> Cosmo.<eos> That's what I'm calling you now.<eos> You're gonna need a catchy name if you're gonna be in a band.<eos> Right.<eos> What happened?<eos> Nothing.
- Tony can come around with his.<eos> Look here, what about this dress?<eos> This dress is lovely.<eos> Do you want to take that one?<eos> Don't touch my things!<eos> You'd look pretty sexy in that one.<eos> When was the last time you noticed anything I wore, any way that I looked?<eos> That's a pretty sexy one, isn't it?<eos> He'll love that one, won't he?<eos> What about knickers?
If my parents found out I took this out, they'd kill me.<eos> Have you taken it out before?<eos> Every few weeks.<eos> A boat's like a musical instrument... it doesn't like it if you don't use it.<eos> That's what my granddad said, you know, so I like to look after it for him.<eos> Look, there's the ferry heading to England.<eos> Full of Irish people.<eos> Okay, so go.<eos> "You just can't stand the way that we walked out from the wreckage."<eos> What wreckage?

I was sort of hoping they'd come to my gig at the end of the month.<eos> What, you thought they'd just become different people and start noticing what you were doing and what you wanted?<eos> They've got their own shit going on.<eos> They're not going to your stupid gig.<eos> So why is it stupid now?<eos> It's not that it's stupid, it's just annoying.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm in withdrawal!<eos> - From what?
Yous have an hour.<eos> Come on, Conor.<eos> She's not coming.<eos> Let's just do whatever.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come over, guys.<eos> Okay, so this is like a school video, except not like an Irish school, more like an American school, and it's prom night.<eos> Have you seen "Back to the Future"?<eos> Okay, well, it's just kind of like '50s dancing, and...<eos> Like what?
- No.<eos> She has her photographs.<eos> I've my demo tapes and videos.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Get the keys.<eos> I'll see you, Mum.<eos> I love you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You call as soon as you get there.<eos> - No messing, all right?
Yes, ma'am.<eos> I'd say that surely is the word for it.<eos> This here's a forgotten war.<eos> It's capital F, capital W.<eos> What's your...<eos> Your name and rank?<eos> I'm Lance Corporal Coughlin, India Company 3-5.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kim.<eos> Your hair.
If we fix the well, you can't blow it up.<eos> Kim, I was talking to some of the younger men.<eos> They say the Taliban came at night.<eos> I don't care. No.<eos> I drank too much water and I have to pee.<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> I am engaged to be married.<eos> Okay, Fahim, I know you like your women to be, like, beautiful, mysterious IKEA bags, okay?<eos> But we urinate, Doctor.<eos> Out of our vaginas.
It's okay.<eos> Half the accents are fake.<eos> The whole "I'm ex-Special Forces" wankers are flat out lying.<eos> "Reportage"?<eos> Oh, Christ, what is this?<eos> I really shouldn't have my back to the door.<eos> It's bad tradecraft, but it's worth it to talk to you two ladies.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> You got it.<eos> Champagne?
And I am warning you now, do not sleep with Iain.<eos> - Who is Iain?<eos> - He's a proper asshole.<eos> - Shall we?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Is that a cab?<eos> Is your full name Shakira?<eos> 'Cause I thought it was a Colombian nickname.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> Because of the singer.
Who told you that?<eos> Very little happens in Afghanistan that Ali Massoud Sadiq does not know about.<eos> Very little.<eos> - May I show you something?<eos> - Of course.<eos> You have a bed in your office.<eos> Yes.<eos> There is a bed here now.<eos> So, no comment on sharia in Kandahar or...<eos> No comment.
Yeah, it might be a bit much for you, Nic?<eos> You're a bit late to the whole "Kandahar's gone to shit" party. You know?<eos> What about the woman thing where the sharia law is back?<eos> And there was a firebombing the other day.<eos> Yeah, I think it's worth the risk.<eos> That's easy for you to say, mate, sitting there in your cozzie taking photos of the fucking garden.<eos> Look, Nicky, I know you've been specially trained to protect New Zealand from, what, fucking dolphins?<eos> But I'm not exactly a war zone virgin, you know?<eos> I was kidnapped by the AIG when they were still called that.<eos> Why dolphins?
I'm not your mate.<eos> I'm gonna ask you again, are you fucking mental?<eos> - Come on, Iain, it's not his fault.<eos> - What's your job again?<eos> Because if I hadn't come back to see you lot because I stole a bottle of sake from a Japanese travel writer...<eos> Wait, you have sake?<eos> ...you could've killed her, "mate!"<eos> Oh, fuck off.<eos> Jesus!<eos> What the fuck?
What Badakhshan thing?<eos> You know China won the contract to mine for gold up there.<eos> They built roads, airport, housing, all that.<eos> Well, guess whose responsibility it is to protect the investment of Red China in this restive nation?<eos> American troops, Chinese gold.<eos> Oh, Iain, that's really good.<eos> People are gonna get mad.<eos> Just waiting for my guy to give me the green light.<eos> You pay for the trip, I'll share the story with you.<eos> Easy peasy.
All of it!<eos> That was a bomb.<eos> Hello!<eos> So, wait!<eos> Who is fronting the show?<eos> Tucker?<eos> No, I don't know who that is.<eos> Okay, well, I could go live for the overnights, but this is...<eos> "Satellite time?" No, I have a dedicated feed.<eos> Since when?
It's a great idea!<eos> It's fucking ace!<eos> Good on ya, Kim!<eos> Let's go, load up!<eos> Let's go, move, move, move!<eos> You drink Tennessee whiskey, Miss Baker?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Outstanding.<eos> Tall Brian?<eos> What the fuck?
- Dad, give us the mission.<eos> - Mission:<eos> Rescue mom! Training in 10 minutes.<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Rell?<eos> Can you flex your fingers?<eos> S-t-o-p.<eos> Stay calm, think, observe and plan.<eos> If you hit the rocks below you, you'll die from blunt force trauma.<eos> Or internal bleeding from massive bone fracturing.

Well, I am so happy that our family is together.<eos> Thanks for putting on this feast.<eos> It's all local and, um, organic and non-gmo, so...<eos> How did you kill those chickens?<eos> With an ax or a knife?<eos> I...<eos> I didn't have to kill the chickens.<eos> I... they, uh... i... it's a rotisserie chicken, so you buy it on... it's already dead. Or cooked. On a thing.<eos> - Dig in.<eos> - All right.
Is knowing how to set a broken bone or how to treat a severe burn ridiculous? Knowing how to navigate by the stars in total darkness... that's ridiculous?<eos> How to identify edible plants, how to make clothes from animal skins, how to survive in the forest with nothing but a knife?<eos> That's ridiculous to you?<eos> Jesus. They have the cardiovascular and muscular endurance levels of elite athletes.<eos> Who cares? They're children!<eos> They need to go to school.<eos> Justin.<eos> Jackson?<eos> Would you please come down here for a second?<eos> What?
Okay. - Bye, grandma. - Bye, grandma and grandpa.<eos> Back on Steve. Let's go.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Let's go. Dad, where are we going?<eos> We're going to stop this fucking funeral! - No, dad!<eos> Dad, no! - Dad, we can't go!<eos> - Please, listen to us.<eos> - Why can't we go to mom's funeral?<eos> - Because of dad.<eos> - Because of his speech?
So we made it Noam Chomsky day.<eos> "Noam chomsky day." I don't even know who that is.<eos> That's the day you gave my grandchildren real weapons.<eos> How did Rellian break his hand?<eos> He slip... he fell.<eos> And it's not broken. He was climbing on a rock face in the rain.<eos> -It was an accident.<eos> And it wasn't raining when we were climbing.<eos> He has bruises over his whole body.<eos> Yeah, and scratches.
Yeah, special, like that. That's them.<eos> Please don't make things any more awkward than they already are.<eos> All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.<eos> Hey, guys, come on in.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Hello.<eos> How is everyone today?<eos> Good, and you?
They all need emergency housing.<eos> They're all special.<eos> Please.<eos> What's so special about a drug addict?<eos> Why this one?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Every now and then, one comes along and you just know they have it in them to be clean.<eos> I think this is his last shot.<eos> He really wants to be clean, but he's got nothing.<eos> No support system at all.
What do you do?<eos> How did you end up here?<eos> - Me?<eos> - Well, I know what he does.<eos> - What have you got there?<eos> - Allergy pill.<eos> Right.<eos> I thought...<eos> Otherwise, I am 100 percent anti-drug.<eos> Lot of addicts in here.
Lot of addicts in here.<eos> I steer clear.<eos> So, what do you do?<eos> How did you end up here?<eos> I'm a musician.<eos> - I write songs and play.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I haven't exactly been discovered yet but I just moved in here, which is good.<eos> From...<eos> Australia.
Yeah, I'm your hero now.<eos> You wait till you realize you've got no bits left.<eos> Morning, mate.<eos> No,no,no,Bob!<eos> Bob, Bob, Bob.<eos> No.<eos> naughty-<eos> Do I not feed you enough?<eos> You only eat what I give you, yeah?<eos> Not the neighbors.
What's it gonna be?<eos> Want some hot dogs?<eos> No?<eos> Okay.<eos> Right, so, what do you fancy?<eos> Wild Pacific pink salmon?<eos> Is that a yes?<eos> Okay, we'll get one of them.<eos> What else?<eos> Some tuna?
I just-<eos> - I want...<eos> I wanna be clean.<eos> I want to live a life, you know?<eos> This kid I knew, Baz...<eos> He...<eos> He OD'd. He died.<eos> And I don't wanna go that way.<eos> I know.<eos> After the holidays.
New girlfriend for you.<eos> This is Bobina.<eos> - He's not impressed.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - He will. Just playing hard to get.<eos> - Don't panic, by the way.<eos> This isn't a you-know-what tree.<eos> No, it's a lamp tree.<eos> Taste like turkey?<eos> - Not even vaguely.
So they forced you to sell to them?<eos> - I wasn't trying to...<eos> - Look, you're taking business off me.<eos> Why are you making this up? Why are you picking on me?<eos> - You took the money.<eos> Yeah? - Enough.<eos> Enough.<eos> One month, no papers.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.
- Yeah. Care for a Big Issue, madam?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> - Actually, we came to see the cat.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Graham can't stop talking about him.<eos> - Where's he from?<eos> He's beautiful, isn't he?<eos> I found him.<eos> - Do you like Bob?<eos> £2.50, please.
He might come back, mightn't he?<eos> He might do, yeah.<eos> He could come home, couldn't he?<eos> James.<eos> I know these two.<eos> I used to see them all the time when he was singing.<eos> But look at this.<eos> This guy and his cat are all over YouTube.<eos> Look at the hits.<eos> Over a million.
- I don't actually have a phone currently.<eos> - Okay.<eos> We can sort that.<eos> Should we get one for Bob?<eos> I think we can share.<eos> Looks like he wants to write it, though.<eos> What are you--<eos> I'm clean, Dad.<eos> -"Clean" as, what, like...?<eos> - Everything.
I think we can share.<eos> Looks like he wants to write it, though.<eos> What are you--<eos> I'm clean, Dad.<eos> -"Clean" as, what, like...?<eos> - Everything.<eos> I just wanted you to know.<eos> You know, I was...<eos> I was thinking while I was standing here just now the last time I wasn't high in front of you I was 11.<eos> Before Australia.
# In the glow of a new-born song #<eos> # Put my lovin' arms around you, baby #<eos> # And I whisper your name #<eos> # I... I whisper your name #<eos> Hey, wow.<eos> Fuck, what did she say her name was?<eos> # As I whisper your name #<eos> Hey, Reggie?<eos> I was thinking...<eos> Sweet dreams.
I'm in dimensions you cannot possibly imagine.<eos> If you're so strong and powerful, why haven't you killed us yet?<eos> You were my subject, and you, well, every Tall Man deserves an amusement.<eos> No!<eos> Hey, Tiny, where the fuck do you think you're going?<eos> Hey, guys<eos> I got this.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Uh, uh?
You know... it's a hell of way to start a trio.<eos> Hey, bro.<eos> Rocky, thanks for waiting around for me.<eos> Hey, little man, Mike figured you'd be back in one piece.<eos> Damn, you left a few on the other side.<eos> That's the great thing about a fireball. Amputation and cauterization all in one.<eos> Let's get to the rendezvous. Hey!<eos> Think I can hitch a ride?<eos> - Really?<eos> - What?
I lie to Scott.<eos> I lie to you.<eos> I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, butlhaveto keep things vague.<eos> Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers.<eos> It doesn't matter who they are.<eos> It matters how they make me feel.<eos> Lying is like taking a trip.<eos> It's like having a secret.<eos> It's like touching yourself and no one else knows.<eos> Except you.
So, when I came home last night,<eos> Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...<eos> Scott's behavior is not normal.<eos> It's a form of emotional abuse.<eos> Are you ever afraid of Scott?<eos> It's not abuse.<eos> Not if you don't care, and I don't.<eos> Maybe it's become a normal state for you.<eos> Is it normal I think about you all the time?<eos> "Almost exactly a week ago,
I'm sorry.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Stay away from me.<eos> This is so stupid.<eos> He makes every conversation about getting pregnant.<eos> And every time we go there...<eos> Where?

I do.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Just not quite yet.<eos> Hi.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Abdic's been released.<eos> What?<eos> There wasn't enough evidence.<eos> And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked.<eos> A lot.
Abdic told them I'm abusive.<eos> When she walked out, I didn't go after her.<eos> InevercaHed to check on her.<eos> I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake.<eos> Got drunk.<eos> No.<eos> We just need to find more evidence on Abdic.<eos> I've spent the whole day going through her stuff.<eos> There's no e-mails, there's nothing.<eos> No letters, no e-mails.

No.<eos> She said you yelled at her that night.<eos> No.<eos> That is not what happened.<eos> She was in the tunnel and she hit me.<eos> I don't wanna argue on the street.<eos> It's the middle of the day and you're drunk.<eos> Look, I'm not drunk, Tom.<eos> My wife is scared of you.<eos> Of what?
Good.<eos> Tell me more.<eos> I used to watch this perfect couple.<eos> And they were just the embodiment of true love.<eos> It's like the kind of love you always want.<eos> And then she betrayed him.<eos> And it sparked something in me.<eos> Why are you really here, Rachel?<eos> Because I'm afraid of myself.<eos> July 5th.

Can't even fucking stand up!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Can you stand?<eos> Fucking disgusting.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.<eos> You did nothing wrong.<eos> Nothing.
Did you get him an invitation to the Ambassador's party yet?<eos> We're working on it.<eos> We're meeting some Government people for dinner next week.<eos> You should come.<eos> Look at his face.<eos> That fake smile.<eos> Maurice isn't very sociable.<eos> We'll do it for the women, yes?<eos> Good.<eos> Until next week.
The German officer at ten o'clock.<eos> I think I recognize him.<eos> He was attached to the Abwehr.<eos> In Marseille.<eos> He interrogated me once.<eos> He hasn't seen you.<eos> He's reading his paper.<eos> You're sure that it's him?<eos> Really sure?<eos> 60% sure.
If it's lower, he must come to the party.<eos> This is too absurd.<eos> Shuffle, Mr. Berne.<eos> High card wins.<eos> Mining?<eos> Yes.<eos> He works with phosphate, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> Now cut, Mr. Berne.<eos> For your freedom.
For what?<eos> Your first weekend off in 57 days.<eos> I counted.<eos> - Are the eggs from the hens?<eos> - From our hens.<eos> So they were a good investment.<eos> Weren't they?<eos> Max, let's go to the heath and pick mushrooms.<eos> Tomorrow I want to serve stroganoff at the party.<eos> What party?
Jeffrey, you're too drunk.<eos> Hey.<eos> Your wife changed her mind.<eos> You mean about the earrings.<eos> No, no, no, I was trying to sell her a broach.<eos> I do have some beautiful earrings. I can offer you a very good price.<eos> Max.<eos> It's okay, Mr. Lombard.<eos> We really are broke.<eos> Good night.

I think that's a good idea.<eos> You're gonna spend your 4:00 a.m.'s drunk, eating burritos over the sink.<eos> I love burritos.<eos> - Yeah, I kind of love them, too.<eos> God, really?<eos> Paranoid much?<eos> You're three minutes and 32 seconds late, pal.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, you're looking sharp.<eos> Huh?
- How much am I worth?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Your life, how much is your life worth?<eos> Why don't you just jot down the dollar amount here?<eos> Do you have any 'flea'?<eos> It ain't much, but...<eos> See the pen?<eos> That's a Valenti, one of the first.<eos> That thing costs about $68,000.<eos> 68,000 dollars?
Thank you.<eos> Do you mind asking Hatty to bring in some dinner menus, please?<eos> You were on your way out, right?<eos> I'll fetch her for you.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's start with some cataloging.<eos> This is the subpoenaed bank records. Cross-reference his offshore accounts with his tax returns, please.<eos> You got a minute?<eos> Yeah, I'm all ears.<eos> In private?
So what would you do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Probably call you.<eos> You know, here's someone like you been through so much, a major tragedy, unthinkable... but you come out the other side.<eos> Many people wouldn't have made it. You did.<eos> I knew that about you. I knew it before you came into my office.<eos> I might have not let you in otherwise.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> So Hill giving me that meeting with you, that was just some kind of a setup or what?<eos> Setup?
We need to talk.<eos> What is it?<eos> I screwed up.<eos> I got mixed up in something that I shouldn't have and...<eos> Did you fuck her?<eos> How did she die?<eos> I don't know. Pills, I think. It looks like she hit her head.<eos> Oh, we worked so hard, Ben.<eos> You know, and we just started to get ahead, and then you throw it away to get involved with an ex-girlfriend<eos> - for a fucking case?
Yeah? No Whisky chasers.<eos> - You told me to remind you next time.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Give us another one.<eos> Come on, man, you've been sat at that stool half the day.<eos> It's time to move on.<eos> Aye, fair enough.<eos> You just missed a call from Dr McLean.<eos> - Mother or son?<eos> - Not Cora... Paul.
All right, here, have a curry.<eos> - Jimmy.<eos> - How are you doing, Paul?<eos> It'll have to be confirmed, but everything we're seeing points to MDMA.<eos> I... collected him from school.<eos> He played in the garden and then on the beach.<eos> They're saying it's ecstasy.<eos> Was he playing on his own?<eos> Yeah, yeah, he knows not to go in the water.<eos> Well, what about school?
The substance has been confirmed as MDMA but it also contains PMA, easier to synthesise, cheaper to make and when mixed with ecstasy, toxic.<eos> - He's sending through the information now.<eos> - What about the wee boy, Callum?<eos> Kidney failure.They're testing his mum as a possible living donor.<eos> I've put out a warning and we've got uniform on the beach.<eos> The bags are still coming in, but not so many.<eos> And I spoke to the coastguard. Given yesterday's wind, their guess is that the rucksack went in somewhere due south of St Ninian's.<eos> Or it could have been dumped where we found it.<eos> There's no wallet in the rucksack?<eos> No ID, no phone?
Is that what happened?<eos> - He picked a fight? - Aye.<eos> Well, some of the blame is mine.<eos> I was twice his age and at least twice as sober.<eos> I should've known better.<eos> It's just... Sometimes, someone pushes your button, you know?<eos> Maybe you don't.<eos> Missing person? Shite!<eos> I'm going to have to take a statement.<eos> From me?
- Whatever it is, Jimmy, whatever it is, this has to be dealt with by a rank inspector.<eos> And until I can find someone to come over here and take your statement, you are to stay away from Michael Maguire.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Someone is yanking both our chains here, Rhona.<eos> Does that not concern you?<eos> Hello?<eos> This way.<eos> Over here.<eos> Where did the body come from?<eos> From inside that.
On whose authority?<eos> Tosh, I want a complete media blackout on this.<eos> - No sirens, no flashing lights.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Ah, for f...<eos> Sandy, can you see what she wants?<eos> Hello?<eos> Sir! Sir!<eos> You have to stop.<eos> Rhona.
What do you do, Mr. Morse?<eos> Nothing. At present.<eos> - Are you one of the idle rich?<eos> - Idle, certainly.<eos> What about yourself, Miss Piper.<eos> - I play a little tennis.<eos> - Don't tease. Elva just happened to win a little trophy at the little French Open.<eos> I thought I knew all Bruce's friends?<eos> It's Anthony I know better.<eos> Anthony Don.

He just bought that vulgar pile.<eos> Bixby?<eos> Mrs. HEARNE:<eos> It's my Jeannie, she left the kiddie with me last night when she went out.<eos> Only she never got back.<eos> All right, Mrs. Hearne.<eos> Let's just take it slowly.<eos> Went out where? To the fair.<eos> With some fella from the depot.<eos> A mechanic.

I didn't tell you, did I?<eos> We came across an accident on the way over.<eos> Young girl got herself more or less cut in half.<eos> Some rather toothsome redhead, according to the constable.<eos> I can't think what they want to come bothering us about it for.<eos> They're probably speaking to everyone local.<eos> See if anyone knew her... I'd expect.<eos> Why don't the three of us go into town and tie one on.<eos> There's a fair, isn't there?<eos> On the Green.
Mr. Thursday?<eos> He doesn't want to be found.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Mr. Morse, how are you?<eos> - I can't hear you.<eos> - Come.<eos> Come with me.<eos> He has a man flies around, scouring the palaces of princes and maharajahs.<eos> - Can you imagine?<eos> - The loot of the world.

Fake.<eos> - A good one, but...<eos> - I doubt that.<eos> He's as rich as Croesus. I've seen it.<eos> The real painting hangs in the Rijksmuseum.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Maybe this is the real one and the one in the Rijksmuseum's is the fake.<eos> I think the curators might have noticed.<eos> They might.<eos> Then again...

She was found dead this morning about three miles from here.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm not the same.<eos> I wouldn't be any use to you.<eos> - No?<eos> Well...<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Mind how you go.<eos> Why would you go back?<eos> After everything?
They're running me off a list of members who booked to play a round on Thursday.<eos> And the telephone number? A call-box sir.<eos> Across the road from Jeannie Hearne's house.<eos> Jakes. Any luck at the fair?<eos> One or two with minor form, sir.<eos> Nothing like this.<eos> We've been over Jeannie Hearne's footsteps so far as Albert Potter can remember them.<eos> - And? - They went on a few rides, took in a magic show, shooting gallery...<eos> Potter says he won her a monkey. - £500? - Stuffed, sir.<eos> - What?
Congratulations, by the way.<eos> Sergeant Strange. Yeah.<eos> Well...<eos> Like piles, eh?<eos> Any leads on this dead woman?<eos> The brains trust retraced her route around the fair. Shooting gallery.<eos> Magic show. Did you look at the Ghost Train?<eos> They did and...<eos> no sign she was ever there. No blood.<eos> Nothing.
It's all anyone's talking about.<eos> Found right on the doorstep, as it were.<eos> Mr. Morse.<eos> Back for Seconds?<eos> Now there's a turn up.<eos> - Is this your doing? - No.<eos> Really?<eos> - Hello, Tony.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Pagan.
- Pagan.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello, darling.<eos> - Kay.<eos> Bruce, may I introduce Joss Bixby?<eos> Bix, this is Lord Belborough and his wife, Lady...<eos> Hello, Kay.<eos> You've met?<eos> Just now.<eos> On the stairs.
Mind if I cut in, old man?<eos> Hello.<eos> Is it really you?<eos> - Cigar? - No, no thank you.<eos> They make a nice couple, don't you think?<eos> How is it you know Bixby?<eos> He advises me on my investments now and again.<eos> But as friends we go back a long way.<eos> Bix's got everything, wouldn't you say?<eos> - Pretty much.
Well, the fair packs up tomorrow, sir. Just so.<eos> What happened, I...<eos> I can't change yesterday, but... ..a better tomorrow, yes?<eos> - For all of us. - Sir.<eos> I think I met Bixby. Briefly.<eos> Some years ago, in Juan-les-Pins.<eos> And there was never anything between you? No.<eos> Not on my part.<eos> And there's no reason you can think of why he'd have a photograph of you on his bedroom wall.<eos> None.
We went on a few rides. Merry-go-round.<eos> Dodgems.<eos> Magic show.<eos> Jeannie wanted me to go on stage with her for a trick, but the magician picked some other bloke out of the audience.<eos> - What did he look like?<eos> - Normal working bloke. Thirties.<eos> Specs.<eos> Doug, he gave his name as.<eos> You didn't notice him or anyone else following you around the fair afterwards?<eos> Nobody.
I'm afraid my car was stolen from Oxford station on Wednesday.<eos> You'll find that I made a full report.<eos> All the good it'll do.<eos> Well, her boyfriend said you gave her a stuffed toy. Why was that?<eos> He said he hadn't won anything.<eos> Gotta cast your bread.<eos> Punters see a good-looking girl walking round with a prize, might have a go themselves.<eos> Where are they from, the prizes?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Far East, maybe.

-It would have been a lie.<eos> - And you and Bruce is what?<eos> At least with me, you would've been loved.<eos> We were meant to be together, Kathy.<eos> I love you.<eos> What put you onto it?<eos> Something he said?<eos> Actually, sir, it was something he didn't say.<eos> Bixby affected the habit of calling everyone "old man", but when I saw him again at the house, he didn't say it.<eos> - Not once.

So what does that make me?<eos> A good detective.<eos> And a poor policeman.<eos> That too.<eos> If only I'd have told him.<eos> Wouldn't have made the blindest bit of difference.<eos> He was set on the girl, his memory of her at least.<eos> Zambezi was right.<eos> There's no real magic in this world.<eos> Only love.
I won't tell.<eos> I wouldn't ever.<eos> Please, take me home.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> No.<eos> That's horrible.<eos> You're just gonna have to be stayin' here with me for the rest of our lives.<eos> You mean, of my life.<eos> For the rest of my life.
Help me!<eos> Help!<eos> You did that.<eos> There you has me right.<eos> I told you I didn't dream so it was much scarier than it needed to be.<eos> Needs must.<eos> Titchy little snapperwhippers like you should not be higgling around with old sage and onions like me.<eos> Giants is all murderful and cannybulls.<eos> They's swallopin' up human beans like they's sugar lumps.<eos> "Beings", not "beans".
I think Oliver's hiding.<eos> Who's he hiding from?<eos> He doesn't want to tell me.<eos> Just don't tell Daddy.<eos> Well, what if we wait until Oliver's ready to tell him?<eos> Promise?<eos> Yeah, I promise.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> I love you.<eos> Good night.

Hi, Mom.<eos> - Oh, my beauty.<eos> Love you. Okay.<eos> Hi, I heard you got engaged.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - It's exciting.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wow. Well, this isn't awkward.<eos> - How about some alcohol?
It should sedate her and also we could do some further testing, but If her behavior doesn't improve, I think we should locate hospital centre better equipped to deal with her problem.<eos> No.<eos> My daughter is not going to psycho ward.<eos> How do you explain the seizures?<eos> How do you explain that she's never been like this before?<eos> How can you just arrive at this conclusion without all of the facts?<eos> Dr. Ryan, why don't you do that further testing before you threaten us with psychiatric hospitals?<eos> - Well?<eos> - They have nothing.<eos> Nothing?
You said black, it's gray and another vehicle.<eos> It's always a Land Cruiser, Mike.<eos> Something's going on.<eos> It seems to be for celebrating some sort of ceremony.<eos> Land Cruiser approaching.<eos> Target is Sayid Assiff, 65 years old.<eos> Confirm, over.<eos> Target, 10 o'clock.<eos> Range 977 meters.<eos> Range 977.
No, wait!<eos> Wait...<eos> Wait, no...<eos> I was not scolding. Just I am trying to get the radio...<eos> Your Highness...<eos> This secret message is your amulet.<eos> It will... be able to protect you from evil forces, my knight...<eos> Don't worry, ok?<eos> I know you have to leave... so, go... defeat your demons as a knight in shining armor.<eos> without blemish and without fear.
- Yeah, but you know what they say about rumors.<eos> - Rumors are the engine of progress.<eos> No, it's laziness - the engine of progress.<eos> Rumors then?<eos> Rumors are ...<eos> Assault on a colleague - is one thing!<eos> Bribery and corruption charges against you and that's it.<eos> We were provoked.<eos> Bob was provoked!<eos> Same thing.
Ok?<eos> And I find that statement to be offensive.<eos> Are you an actor?<eos> Dyslexia is only for movie stars.<eos> The rest of us call it stupidity.<eos> You know these bastards?<eos> You shouldn't have done that.<eos> And what will he do?<eos> Tell Mom?<eos> What the fuck?
You two are fucked up.<eos> You still homies with Jimmy Harris?<eos> Not since back in the day. Thought he moved on.<eos> Not everyone can sell toasters, you now?<eos> I work at the highest level!<eos> I'm a designer of stolen toasters.<eos> Yes, big fucking shit!<eos> Fancy, shit.<eos> Yeah, fancy shit!<eos> From Moschino!
She's into some kind of trouble?<eos> Just give us the fucking address.<eos> You guys are adorable...<eos> Where are you from?<eos> What district?<eos> We are from hell, baby.<eos> You know that guy that discoverd Uranus wanted to call it George.<eos> This is the planet George.<eos> Come on, Harris.<eos> What?
- Harry who<eos> - Harry fucking Krishna.<eos> Get away from the door, mam.<eos> Yeah, it is Muhammad Ali!<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> He is a Quaker.<eos> You have any guns stashed anywhere?<eos> No! I told you, he is a Quaker.<eos> He denies violence.<eos> What?
Tell me about Russell Berdvelle.<eos> What is there to tell ...<eos> He is the owner of a strip club.<eos> He is not like Diaghilev "Russian ballet".<eos> He wanted to now, why you were looking for me.<eos> I told him that you were looking for Jimmy.<eos> That wasn't good enough for Mr. Berdvellu, was it?<eos> He's crazy.<eos> I had a runin with him before.<eos> What about?
It's a nice round number.<eos> That is my favorite round number.<eos> We do not need a million for pensions.<eos> Not if you gonna get killed going after it.<eos> I can handle myself.<eos> Don't you worry your pretty little head about that.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Besides, fortune favors the bold.<eos> You know where that's from?<eos> Greek mythology.
- 50.<eos> Hundred.<eos> Okay, fifty dollars!<eos> Where is he?<eos> You will not believe this.<eos> Fucking Iceland.<eos> They have something called a "Blue Lagoon". It's a hot spa. It's outdoors.<eos> Probably full of sweaty Europeans with bad teeth, fucking each other.<eos> You will swim around in jizz.<eos> European jizz.
No, it's not.<eos> Life is unfair.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> I hate jellyfish.<eos> I wonder how it got here?<eos> Maybe it fell from a spaceship.<eos> Is it true that they can sting you even when they are dead?<eos> No, I think when they are dead... they are dead.<eos> They are immortal, though.<eos> What?
- Wait, wait.<eos> - Come on!<eos> I can't run in these!<eos> Hurry!<eos> "I am real!", said Alice and began to cry.<eos> "You won't be more real by crying" Tweedledum remarks.<eos> "There is nothing to cry about"<eos> We finish reading tomorrow.<eos> Dad, What happens when you die?<eos> Nothing.
Fuck you!<eos> I must say you're taking this turn of events rather well.<eos> We did not come here for the money.<eos> We don't care about the money any more.<eos> This is about Danny Reynard.<eos> Danny Reynard ...<eos> I can't... quite place the name.<eos> You know, one day... these students were taking a philosophy exam and to start the tutor grabs a chair and puts it on a desk and he says: "For your last test, prove that this chair exists. "<eos> So, everyone begin to write.<eos> Except for one guy.
Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm late, I know.<eos> Sorry.<eos> They kept me at work an extra hour.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> What's that?<eos> I fell off my bike.<eos> - That thing?
We're meeting Wednesday to oppose it.<eos> You're on the Board, aren't you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I've tried to point out that minor conflict of interest.<eos> It's an interesting position.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I hope you can make it.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> - Goodnight. - Goodnight.
Nice, huh?<eos> A little too nice, don't you think?<eos> There's room for a 50-inch here.<eos> Did you ask her?<eos> You mentioned a microwave, but we thought a TV makes a better housewarming present.<eos> Don't you need an oven more than a TV?<eos> We don't need one. The kitchen comes fully equipped.<eos> Is this the apartment you told me about?<eos> No, it's a 2-bedroom here.<eos> $250 a month more.
But I always feel that.<eos> I wonder if it isn't starting again.<eos> A new cycle.<eos> You don't know?<eos> The Accused Will Rise about your father aired again last Saturday.<eos> - Refreshes people's memories.<eos> - I'd no idea.<eos> And you?<eos> Anything happened?<eos> No, nothing special.
Yes.<eos> I wouldn't even know how to intubate your sparrow.<eos> If it is a sparrow.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> ...victims of all ages.<eos> Seen today, this quiet street in the suburbs of Nantes bears no trace of the atrocities that took place here<eos> 39 years ago.
A nation held its breath.<eos> In shock.<eos> Time has dulled the terror of that distant day in May.<eos> But for some the horror will never fade away.<eos> Nor will the unanswered questions.<eos> What drove Georges Leblanc, a practising Catholic, loving husband and father, to commit such monstrous and senseless acts?<eos> And what role exactly was played by his daughter, Michèle?<eos> A ten-year-old child at the time.<eos> After years of trials and psychiatric evaluations, over 30 years after Georges Leblanc's incarceration, sentenced to life, the questions remain, as banal yet chilling as ever.<eos> First and foremost...
They did an ultrasound.<eos> - She has a...<eos> -A placental abruption.<eos> They say it's okay but they're inducing labor.<eos> - Oh<eos> -Omar, a buddy of mine.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Dad!<eos> - What's the news?<eos> - Nothing yet.
- See you then. - See you then.<eos> Thank you.<eos> In theory, we could put a toothpick inside one for Richard's ladylove.<eos> Or just poison her.<eos> She has me pegged as a Medea, She'd see it coming.<eos> Consumed by jealousy.<eos> She was a classics major, too?<eos> - Josie.<eos> - Robert.<eos> Merry Christmas!
- Okay, Dad?<eos> - Great.<eos> Hi, kiddo.<eos> Jeez, he stinks.<eos> Here!<eos> How you doing?<eos> You trying to deafen us all with your shit?<eos> Careful.<eos> Hello, all!<eos> Merry Christmas!
We were about to burn our clothes when the police arrived.<eos> Someone snapped a photo.<eos> Bizarrely, it's that photo that stuck in people's minds.<eos> Me, half-naked, smeared with ash.<eos> The photo of a little girl as psychopath, next to her father, the psychopath.<eos> My empty stare in the photo is terrifying.<eos> Not bad, huh?<eos> Cognac?<eos> - Love one.<eos> - Same glass okay?
Disgusting.<eos> Like this salad, with its shitty olives.<eos> You can't stay mad at me till the end.<eos> Sure, the news channel works fine.<eos> She's in v-tach.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's that beep?<eos> Ma'am. please.<eos> Cardiac arrest!<eos> 20 mg of GTN.

What a waste!<eos> Ms. Leblanc...<eos> Your father is dead.<eos> Shortly before 8 am, we found him deceased in his cell.<eos> How?<eos> There'll be an investigation, but he appears to have hanged himself with a sheet.<eos> When did this happen?<eos> We only know it must have been between 7pm and 7am.<eos> At what time was my father notified that I was coming today?<eos> Shortly before 7pm.
I can imagine.<eos> You want to see it?<eos> Ok.<eos> There we are.<eos> All noise is muffled by the door.<eos> - Vincent's upstairs.<eos> - Yes, he is.<eos> Do it.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Not for me.
Give me a minute, then we can go.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> Two whiskeys and an OJ, please.<eos> It's going great!<eos> It's me.<eos> What's you?<eos> It's me, sleeping with Robert.<eos> It's over now, but it was me.<eos> How long?<eos> 6-8 months.
- Sorry? - Twisted.<eos> Between us, it's sick.<eos> Diseased.<eos> I was in some kind of weird denial but I see clearly now.<eos> What do you see?<eos> You don't expect to get away with what you did to me?<eos> I'll do what I should've done at once.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's not just about me. There's your wife, too.<eos> And others, perhaps.
- I need you to be my ally on this.<eos> - She won't risk coming here... unless she gets an invitation from the whole council.<eos> And I could never solicit such a request.<eos> Cassius is protective of the old ways.<eos> He barely tolerates my seat on the council as it is.<eos> But these are desperate times, Thomas.<eos> And that is why you must convince the council to invite her.<eos> They arrive tonight.<eos> Dawn alert.<eos> 60 seconds to sunrise.
The light in her eyes...<eos> Don't try and fabricate some kind of martyrdom for her.<eos> I prefer a more honest appraisal of her decision.<eos> She abandoned her only son for the sake of her precious council.<eos> - Take it.<eos> - David.<eos> David.<eos> Amelia asked me to give him this.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Nothing.
- Your people?<eos> Kill him.<eos> Kill him.<eos> You aspire to be the protector of your bloodline... yet you kill your own kind in pursuit of power.<eos> It ends now.<eos> I am David, son of the great Elder Amelia.<eos> And I am the rightful heir to this coven.<eos> Amelia had no son.<eos> Well, she had the foresight... to know that my claim would be challenged.<eos> For the council.
- I'm so sorry.<eos> Hey, bro, you seen that dog?<eos> - He's so cute, ain't he?<eos> - Poor little Runt.<eos> And this dude right here, Billy he is our designated driver.<eos> He's an awesome dude, and he lives in West Virginia.<eos> And this man can sing and play guitar.<eos> - Hey, I'm Sean.<eos> I'm from Texas.<eos> - Texas?
- I'm Corey.<eos> I'm from Baltimore.<eos> - I'm Katness, and I'm from Miami.<eos> - She got mean pole-dancing skills.<eos> Katness is so beautiful, loving, caring...<eos> I don't even know what to say about that girl.<eos> So, I have this obsession with Darth Vader.<eos> To me, he's just like the epitome of just darkness and suffering.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Um, and misunderstanding.
You're new.<eos> So... Oh, and, um, I got you a present.<eos> You got me a present?<eos> You don't have to close your eyes or anything.<eos> You just gotta prove to me your real name is Star.<eos> You're funny.<eos> Prove to me your name is Star, and I'll give it to you.<eos> It was my mom's idea.<eos> She said we're all made from stars.<eos> From Death Stars.
It was my mom's idea.<eos> She said we're all made from stars.<eos> From Death Stars.<eos> Can I get my present?<eos> I made that.<eos> You got girly handwriting.<eos> You're a Death Star?<eos> Scared?<eos> Bang.<eos> What the fuck?
I don't know.<eos> Everybody knew my fucking toilet didn't work.<eos> Hey, Austin.<eos> What's Losers' Night?<eos> That's a fun motherfucking night right there.<eos> Yeah, kinda, sort of.<eos> It's a party practically.<eos> It's where the two losers of the week...<eos> - Whoever makes the least amount...<eos> - Least amount of money.
Yeah, it's stupid shit.<eos> It's bullshit.<eos> We have fun.<eos> - It is tradition.<eos> - I never lose.<eos> You know what Darth Vader looks like inside his suit?<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> He's a skeleton.<eos> Just like the rest of us.
What does that material feel like to you?<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> You know what kind of material it is?<eos> - Uh-uh.<eos> - That's boyfriend material.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Look right here.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> - Genuine boyfriend...<eos> - Hi, there.
I'm just trying to give her some insight as to why you're acting out.<eos> Okay, I think it's time for you to go.<eos> I think if you gave me five more minutes, ma'am.<eos> I have been trying to be Christian, but I can see the devil has a hold of the two of you.<eos> I think the devil has a hold of your daughter.<eos> Destiny, turn off the music and put some clothes on!<eos> No!<eos> It's my birthday, and you said I could do what I like.<eos> Thank you so much for your time.<eos> - Happy birthday!
- You need these too.<eos> Kat.<eos> Damn.<eos> That's a girl.<eos> How much?<eos> I ain't got shit.<eos> You what?<eos> - I ain't got shit.<eos> - You didn't get shit?<eos> - Hell, no.
Okay, here we go.<eos> You just gonna play the silent treatment the whole time?<eos> You forgot to wash your hands, Power Boy.<eos> I was actually keeping her sweet for you, Death Star.<eos> - You ever think of it that way?<eos> - I don't need you to fight my battles.<eos> I'm not fighting.<eos> Actually, I was doing a service if you think about it.<eos> - Yeah, you were.<eos> - Yeah, for you.
How much you make?<eos> About 400.<eos> Wow. $400.<eos> Did you let them touch you?<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - No.<eos> It was a sale.<eos> I got the receipts to prove it.<eos> It's $400.<eos> $400.
And he used to just let me free, just let me roam, you know.<eos> He taught me that wolf noise in case I ever got lost or got into shit, you know, I'd just do the noise.<eos> How could he tell if it was you or a real wolf?<eos> 'Cause there's no real wolves up there.<eos> - So you were the only wolf.<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Losers' Night.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me get the money.<eos> - My sales?
Happy birthday!<eos> Happy birthday, Pagan!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Whoo!<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> # Happy birthday to you<eos> # Happy birthday to you<eos> # Happy birthday, dear Pagan<eos> # Happy birthday to you #<eos> Hell, yeah!
I got some right there.<eos> I know I got more.<eos> And I got these ones, look.<eos> No, I love boats.<eos> You got a boat?<eos> - Never even been to the ocean.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> I know it's crazy, but one day.<eos> It's my dream.<eos> How about you?
I know it's crazy, but one day.<eos> It's my dream.<eos> How about you?<eos> What's your dream?<eos> - No one's ever asked me that before.<eos> - Well, somebody has now.<eos> I wanna have my own place, and my own trailer.<eos> You know, somewhere with lots of trees, like real big ones.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And lots of kids.
- Well, somebody has now.<eos> I wanna have my own place, and my own trailer.<eos> You know, somewhere with lots of trees, like real big ones.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And lots of kids.<eos> Well, you'll need a big trailer.<eos> How much for these two?<eos> - You're gonna get both of 'em?<eos> - I figure I will.<eos> Bye.
What the fuck?<eos> Yo! The bathroom's sick too.<eos> I'm sleeping outside!<eos> And we got a kitchen!<eos> We can have home-cooked meals.<eos> - There's a symbol on the wall.<eos> - Oh, look at that wall.<eos> You got water to wash your dishes.<eos> - Are we picking rooms?<eos> - No more catfish.
# As your shadow crosses mine<eos> # What it takes to come alive<eos> # It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny<eos> # But I've gotta let it go<eos> # We found love in a hopeless place<eos> Yeah, QT.<eos> Shake it!<eos> What's up, ladies?<eos> You girls prostitutes or what?<eos> The fuck?
- What are you selling?<eos> - I sell magazines.<eos> - The bus is here.<eos> You gotta make your money somehow.<eos> I respect that.<eos> Good luck, sales associates.<eos> Can I get you to go for me?<eos> It's okay.<eos> All right.<eos> How about, er...
- You make money selling that shit?<eos> - I got a shit-ton of titles.<eos> What kind of titles are we talking about?<eos> Well, anything you like.<eos> - You like boats, deer?<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.<eos> I'll give you $500 to hang out with me tonight.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, hell.<eos> - $500?
You actually came.<eos> Get on in.<eos> I brought some wine for you.<eos> I figured all girls like wine.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> Cheers.<eos> - So where are we going?<eos> - It's a surprise.<eos> I think you'll really like it.<eos> Especially for you.
Bye, house.<eos> - Hey, what's your name?<eos> - Drema.<eos> Drema, I'm Star.<eos> It's so cute.<eos> Hey, yeah.<eos> Put it on Drema.<eos> It's got really big eyes.<eos> I got the munchies.<eos> Twelve miles.
# Whoo!<eos> - Let's do this.<eos> - Get our bags. Get our bags.<eos> - Somebody grab my bag.<eos> - Fuck this van!<eos> Y'all grab my bag. I'm not doing it.<eos> - QT!<eos> - Yes, ma'am!<eos> - Come on, Bella.<eos> - What up?
Baby-back ribs?<eos> They're from a pig.<eos> Just a touch early in the morning for me, thank you, ma'am. Okay.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> - They're here if you need them.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Who would try to extort money from my husband?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> What about you?
Lieutenant wants to see you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cut that with a knife.<eos> Rain check.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You okay with this partner thing?<eos> Yeah, I think I am.<eos> I, uh... I actually have a pretty good feeling about it.<eos> Cool.<eos> Me too.
Come inside, come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> I have to do all this make lunch boxes for all the men you have to feed your stomach, you kno<eos> Everybody has to work<eos> I help my mum to carry rocks<eos> Your mum carries rocks?<eos> What is this?<eos> Just drink<eos> Leave some for me!<eos> And now a bit of soap
That's why I'm here<eos> People don't like me here<eos> Look at this<eos> We have been asking around about you for a long time<eos> We have published it in the newspaper<eos> In all the newspapers in Calcutta<eos> 15 million people read this paper that's a lot of people<eos> But we haven't had a single reply<eos> My home is really far<eos> Not one reply

Why don't we take her out? We can head up the coast?<eos> Hey, Saroo...<eos> Mate, your mum's not, um, look, we've lost track of Mantosh, he's missing again.<eos> You know how worried she gets.<eos> We know you quit your job, mate.<eos> Just worried about you, son.<eos> I've been visiting her.<eos> Every night I walk those streets home.<eos> Home from the dam.<eos> Home from the station.
Imagine if the Imperial authorities had found out... who you really were, Jyn Erso.<eos> That is your given name, is it not?<eos> Jyn Erso, daughter of Galen Erso?<eos> A known Imperial collaborator in weapons development.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a chance for you to make a fresh start.<eos> We think you might be able to help us.<eos> This is Captain Cassian Andor, Rebel Intelligence.<eos> When was the last time you were in contact with your father?<eos> 15 years ago.
I've done that.<eos> They have to know there's a way to destroy this thing.<eos> They have to go to Scarif to get the plans.<eos> I can't risk sending that.<eos> We're in the heart of Imperial territory.<eos> Then we'll find him and bring him back.<eos> And he can tell them himself.<eos> Course set for Eadu, sir.<eos> I'm one with the Force, the Force is with me.<eos> 20 degrees to the right.

We've got to go up.<eos> You can't see much from down there.<eos> This way.<eos> I'll be right behind you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna follow Jyn.<eos> Her path is clear.<eos> Alone?<eos> Good luck!
Attention, all flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately.<eos> All flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately.<eos> We have been redirected to Scarif.<eos> Pilots, you'll be briefed by your squadron leaders en route.<eos> May the Force be with you.<eos> Scarif?<eos> They're going to Scarif?<eos> Why does nobody ever tell me anything, R2?<eos> Move, move, move!<eos> Forward!

Stop!<eos> The rebels, they went over there.<eos> K, what's going on out there?<eos> There's one.<eos> Ah, well.<eos> Come on!<eos> Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.<eos> We're starting our attack run on the shield gate.<eos> Keep it tight, and watch out for those towers.<eos> More fighters.
Have you cheated on an exam?<eos> No.<eos> Do you believe the United States is the greatest country in the world?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Why do you want to join the CIA?<eos> How would you explain the Internet to a child?<eos> Your grandad retired as an admiral and joined the FBI.<eos> Dad's in the Coast Guard. 30-year man.<eos> What has been the most important day in your life?<eos> 9/11.
The average test time is five hours.<eos> If you take more than eight, you will fail.<eos> Mr. O'Brien?<eos> I'm done, sir.<eos> You don't have to tell me when you've completed a stage.<eos> No, I finished the whole thing.<eos> -It's been 40 minutes.<eos> 38.<eos> -What?<eos> 38 minutes.
No to Bush, no to bombs.<eos> Would you mind signing our petition, please?<eos> -Yes, absolutely.<eos> Thank you<eos> -Thank you so much.<eos> Sir?<eos> -No thank you.<eos> Excuse me ma'am, you you like to sign? -I actually just signed.<eos> -Okay, thank you very much.<eos> Too much independent spirit for you?
-That'd be great.<eos> Mr. O'Brien, can I ask you a question?<eos> -How about just calling me Corbin? Okay.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Corbin.<eos> I was talking with Hank Forrester, and I wanted to know are all of our SIGINT programs specifically targeted?<eos> Of course. What good would they be if they weren't?<eos> Yeah, I don't know.<eos> Do you have a girlfriend, Ed?<eos> -Uh, nothing serious.
I've seen it many times and I'm always happy to help a man break a bad habit before it gets going.<eos> Well, thank you, I really appreciate it.<eos> It's the cleanest Pakistani I've ever seen.<eos> You got no first degree ties to government or ISI. No shady family.<eos> Second degree contacts are off the charts, but that's everyone in the Middle East with a six-figure income.<eos> It's not dirt that we need necessarily.<eos> It's a pressure point.<eos> Something intimate. Some kind of weakness.<eos> Can we look through his family?<eos> How about his sister-in-law?
Uh, probably in Japan.<eos> Remember every time a camera pointed at me, it was...<eos> I couldn't breathe. -Why was that?<eos> I probably spent too much time looking at other people through cameras.<eos> Japan was your first NSA job, right?<eos> Yeah, well as a contractor; Dell.<eos> I had a lot of access.<eos> Why'd you go back after Geneva?<eos> Because of the money, and because I wanted to live in Japan.<eos> And because of Obama, actually.
Let's go to bed, and wake up in the morning, go climb this fucking mountain.<eos> Of course we're not gonna talk about it. -What is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means that we don't talk about anything anymore.<eos> You work 12 hour days, you come home depressed.<eos> You play fucking video games and then you fall asleep.<eos> Yeah, I'm tired because I have a job, that's what pays for this apartment in the most expensive city in the world.<eos> Which you asked me to come to, knowing that I did not have a work visa.<eos> Okay, what if you had one, would you really give up your beautiful life of eating and sleeping and going out all the time?<eos> You think you'd really want a career?<eos> -A career like yours?
I don't hold that against you.<eos> Is there something you do hold against me?<eos> You didn't tell me we were running a Dragnet on the whole world, Corbin.<eos> Great shooting, Ed. -Thank you.<eos> That's terrific.<eos> So, one thing in the Army I was good at.<eos> You ever think, Ed, since the Second World War, it's been 60 years, and still no WW3.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we use our power, generally, for the good of the world.<eos> For prosperity.

And real friends, and we're close to our families.<eos> I know.<eos> I understand. And if you want to stay, then we're staying.<eos> That's it.<eos> Don't just say that because I wanna hear it.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I let you go once.<eos> I'm not gonna do it again.<eos> Shit, I'm sorry.<eos> The pasta.
It's real.<eos> Tell us, did the White House make any specific claims about national security, that would prevent you from publishing?<eos> No.<eos> I asked them repeatedly.<eos> And they had no substantive answer.<eos> Then there you go. What more do you want?<eos> You can go out, and know that you're safe.<eos> Glenn, I'd like to talk to Alan before we go any further.<eos> When does he land?<eos> -In six hours.
-PRISM is the second story, Janine.<eos> Verizon is the first story.<eos> Have it ready to post by 4pm, 5 at the latest.<eos> No games, or we're gone.<eos> 'THE TUNNEL' NSA OPS. CENTER OAHU, HAWAII - 2012<eos> So my new job was counter-spying on the Chinese<eos> At the NSA regional cryptological center on Oahu.<eos> You mind placing your bag down there, sir?<eos> No personal laptops, no usb sticks, no cell phones,<eos> No electronic devices of any kind?
No personal laptops, no usb sticks, no cell phones,<eos> No electronic devices of any kind?<eos> -No, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Snow White, is that you?<eos> Gabriel?<eos> -Dude, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Wow, this is amazing.<eos> What, do you work here?<eos> -Yeah, yeah. Three years, two months and uh, five days.
Why the heat map?<eos> -It's my bad, Trev.<eos> I made a bet with Ed about which country we were collecting the most signals from.<eos> He said Iran and I said Pakistan.<eos> Who won? -Ed.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna head out.<eos> I'll see you guys.<eos> You're going down next time.<eos> -Yeah, okay.<eos> No more bets.
Living in Hawaii, in paradise, making a ton of money, what would it take, to make you leave everything behind?<eos> The fear that I've had most in regards to the outcome for America with these disclosures is that nothing will change in the coming months, and the coming years, it will just get worse.<eos> And then, eventually, at some point some new leader will be elected who flips the switch and the people won't be able to do anything by that point to oppose it.<eos> And it'll be turnkey tyranny.<eos> How you holdin' up?<eos> -Yeah, I'll be fine.<eos> You guys have to start watching after yourselves now.<eos> You know, if you have any reason to believe that you're about to be raided or intercepted or breached in any way, you format and destroy all the data immediately.<eos> You have the encrypted backups.<eos> Now I...
You guys have them all.<eos> Keep the focus on the stories.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> If you'll excuse me, it's...<eos> We should all get some rest. We could use it.<eos> Yeah, I should probably lay down in a soft bed, while I still have one available, right?<eos> Rest well.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> -Good night.
# What a way to waste of a lovely night #<eos> Hi, Greg.<eos> Hi. Oh, sorry I'm late.<eos> Yeah. Very soon.<eos> Okay. Bye.<eos> - It's just right there.<eos> - Just right here.<eos> Do you want a ride to your car?<eos> No, I'm just right up here.<eos> Good night.

They don't know where it comes from.<eos> You know?<eos> Jazz was born in a little flophouse in New Orleans... and just because people were crammed in there, they spoke five different languages.<eos> They couldn't talk to each other. The only way that they could communicate was with jazz.<eos> You know, what about Kenny G?<eos> What?<eos> What about Kenny G? I mean, what about elevator music?<eos> You know, jazz music that I know.<eos> - What about it?<eos> - From my life.
- You've never seen it!<eos> - I've never seen it.<eos> Oh my.<eos> You know it's playing in the Rialto.<eos> - Really? - Yes.<eos> You should go.<eos> I mean, I... I can take you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You know, for research.<eos> - For research. Yeah. - Yeah.
- Really? - Yes.<eos> You should go.<eos> I mean, I... I can take you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You know, for research.<eos> - For research. Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Monday night, ten o'clock.<eos> - Yeah. Great. - Okay.<eos> For research.
- Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It feels really nostalgic to me.<eos> - That's the point. - Is it too nostalgic? - That's...<eos> - Are people gonna like it?<eos> Fuck 'em!<eos> - You always say that.<eos> - Well, I truly believe that.<eos> - I made you something. - For what?<eos> For your club.
- We're good. - You need anything?<eos> Bye baby.<eos> - Say "Bye bye, Mommy." - Sleep well.<eos> - Bye, Mommy.<eos> - Have fun with Chelsea.<eos> - Have fun.<eos> Bye, Mia. - Bye.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - Good night guys.<eos> Bye sweetie! - Good night.
Hi.<eos> Officer Cavanaugh.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I'm the new owner of the Lost Woods Resort and I need to report a break-in.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I have to ask.<eos> You're a dead ringer for a woman who used to live here.<eos> Jessica was my sister.<eos> She's Jessica's twin, Mary Drake.<eos> From the Radley file.
Come on, let's go.<eos> Hey, there's no reason for all four of us to tail her.<eos> Look, Caleb's right.<eos> Let's head back over to the motel and find out everything we can about Mary Drake.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> - Can I borrow your keys?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Here.<eos> Yeah, but you'll need another thing to push down...<eos> Tumbler?
No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> - Books.
No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> - Books.<eos> - And more books.
Was it a slip or are we friends with benefits?<eos> Are we even a we again?<eos> I guess we have a lot to talk about.<eos> Yeah, I just, I, um, feel like I need to think about it before I can talk about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Em, hey.<eos> How did it go with Ali?<eos> Uh, turns out they wouldn't let me in to see her.<eos> Do you still have that key that I gave you?<eos> Ali's?
Yeah.<eos> Sad, isn't it?<eos> - That's really your job?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, um, how much would you charge to beat up my friend Janet?<eos> - What?<eos> - How much you got?<eos> - 30 bucks.
- Huh? What do you do?<eos> - Projectionalist.<eos> Yeah, anyway, um, Dean had this whole room like filled with film stock.<eos> One day it just went up, you know...<eos> And, uh, yeah, it cost the guy his life and his life's work.<eos> So, kind of, I don't know, kind of makes you think, right?<eos> Not really, Chet.<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> Kid.<eos> What?
- Yeah.<eos> You sure you didn't see another girl?<eos> Nope.<eos> You guys wanna see my dick?<eos> Nobody wants to see your dick, dude.<eos> - 20 bucks?<eos> - What am I saying? - Oh, all right.<eos> Fags!<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> What?
Holly, are you still frowning?<eos> What's in my hand?<eos> What?<eos> I know how you do that.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sit.<eos> First of all, I wanna say thank you.<eos> We've been watching interviews, and it sounds like you might have saved my daughter's life.<eos> That was mostly Holly.<eos> - His daughter.
The lawsuit for the catalytic converter.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's half my day.<eos> The other half I spend on pornography.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - What kind? Like which films?<eos> What's your favourite?<eos> No, no.<eos> Uh, anti.<eos> Anti-porn.
Now you're getting the carpet all wet.<eos> - Was this your room?<eos> - No, it was Mom and Dad's.<eos> Your dad tells me you're rebuilding.<eos> Does it look rebuilt to you?<eos> Not especially.<eos> Dad barely ever comes here.<eos> He feels guilty, I guess.<eos> Because?<eos> Oh, the fire.
It's not a flight.<eos> Every airport has an overflight curfew from 10:00 to 6:00,<eos> Burbank included.<eos> And that top number is today's date but reversed like the European way, which makes sense when you look at FLT and you think it's not "flight," it's probably "flat," like apartment.<eos> And Burbank APT West?<eos> Burbank Apartments West.<eos> It's a dump.<eos> Fuck it, I'll show you.<eos> Holly, go to Janet's this time.<eos> - But for real.
To the airport, then?<eos> Well, they used to have an overflight curfew.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right. It's okay.<eos> - They did.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And they still should if they changed them.<eos> They should, they should change them back.<eos> - Pull over.<eos> - What?
It's all right.<eos> It's all right. It's okay.<eos> - They did.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And they still should if they changed them.<eos> They should, they should change them back.<eos> - Pull over.<eos> - What?<eos> - Pull over.<eos> - Hey, what the fuck?
Because?<eos> Because she's the head of the Justice Department.<eos> Oh, and, by the way, you're welcome.<eos> You're out, free on your own recognisance.<eos> You get to walk.<eos> There should be like a statue of me in your fucking house.<eos> I'm sorry, guys.<eos> You're gonna lose this one, all right?<eos> Your word against hers.<eos> No evidence.
You lose.<eos> You better seriously think about changing your story.<eos> Oh, fuck it.<eos> Maybe they're right.<eos> Maybe the goddamn birds can't breathe.<eos> Amelia, Misty, Dean, Shattuck, all dead.<eos> The rest of us just get to choke.<eos> I need a drink.<eos> - How much do I owe you, buddy?<eos> - 12 bucks, pal.
- The protestor guy?<eos> Give me that shit.<eos> She was planning something with Chet.<eos> Opening night?<eos> The LA auto show.<eos> - It's today, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Big party.<eos> Mucky-mucks.<eos> Loads of press.
Already working?<eos> Good for you.<eos> I am compensating for yesterday's late arrival.<eos> There is nothing better than to start a day from a cup of fragrant Italian coffee.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Still, it's not the most pleasant place for it.<eos> Do you know more pleasant places?<eos> Casa del Cafe, for example.<eos> Or at my place at least.<eos> At your place?
Did your sister have conflicts with her neighbor?<eos> The whole house had.<eos> Because of those stinky cats.<eos> Why do you ask me about that old cat-crazy woman?<eos> When did you last see Kostitsky?<eos> At the face-to-face, when they let that bastard Komarov go.<eos> Have you seen this man?<eos> No.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Goodbye.

However, Komarov did not leave the building alone, but instead, with the police captain who I do not know.<eos> Having suspected something strange, I decided to follow this car.<eos> The captain dragged Komarov out of the car and led him into the waste lot.<eos> I hid behind the body of an old car.<eos> I did not risk leaving my cover until the dawn came.<eos> Additionally, I can state the following:<eos> I saw the abovementioned police captain in the 47th police station".<eos> Where he stayed himself due to a petty case.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.
And these are the bullets we extracted from the victims' heads.<eos> The expert assessment showed that those were also shot from Makarov service pistol belonging to captain Shevtsov.<eos> Now, I understand why he cut those heads off.<eos> So that the bullets were not found.<eos> There is a reply to your request, colonel.<eos> Thank you, Anatoliy Borisovich.<eos> So what does this mean?<eos> The real sergeant Shevtsov died on May 16, 2001 during the taking of Gudermes.<eos> And who are we looking for now?<eos> A ghost.
Get a stretcher, fast!<eos> We've got a gunshot injury, possibly a broken spine.<eos> Man, 35 years of age, unconscious.<eos> -Captain Shevtsov.<eos> -Wait a minute!<eos> Tell the police it's captain Shevtsov.<eos> I need enhanced guard.<eos> I have important information.<eos> It's captain Shevtsov.<eos> No witnesses and no evidence.
Her real brother died two years ago. Leukemia.<eos> But he lived at Chernyshova's place.<eos> Might be her boyfriend.<eos> And one more thing.<eos> The tattoos.<eos> Both Shevtsov and Chernyshova's boyfriend have identical ones.<eos> Only the blood group is different.<eos> 1354.<eos> Any return on fingerprints request?<eos> No.
Wait a bit.<eos> I'm selecting the right patch.<eos> Hack, you hacker.<eos> Done.<eos> Will you mind leaving us?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Rewind.<eos> Stop.<eos> What's he taking from the table?<eos> A jar of red caviar.
Have you ever eaten fat-free cheese?<eos> -What kind of cheese?<eos> -Fat-free!<eos> Hands!<eos> -What kind of cheese is that?<eos> -You'll try it.<eos> Harder!<eos> My wife made me go on a diet and fried a whole bowl of cheesecakes.<eos> A whole bowl of disgusting cheesecakes made of fat-free cheese.<eos> And nothing more.

And again no recording.<eos> Okay, rewind now.<eos> Stop.<eos> Before that, we had three guards, and all three are dead.<eos> And here, we have four.<eos> Zoom in to the fourth one.<eos> That's the one to tell us what was happening in the missing hours!<eos> How do you feel?<eos> What happened to me?<eos> An arrhythmia attack.
Leaving out the details...<eos> Leaving out the details, I'll cut to the gist.<eos> There were three shots, each injury was mortal.<eos> The guard who had resigned is the main suspect.<eos> Get back to work.<eos> Lebedev!<eos> Stay here for a minute.<eos> Petya! What are you having with medical examiner Nordin?<eos> Nothing, General.<eos> Nothing?
Probably no one.<eos> I live alone.<eos> You think I killed the guys?<eos> What were your relationships with the victims?<eos> Normal working relationships.<eos> Any conflicts at work?<eos> No.<eos> Then, why did you resign so abruptly?<eos> What happened there?<eos> Nothing.
I didn't kill anyone.<eos> I did take money.<eos> Then, I got frightened and left.<eos> They attacked someone every day and chose the most helpless ones.<eos> Women and drunk teenagers.<eos> Someone would have told on them anyway.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> I just took money and nothing else.<eos> What "else"?<eos> Nothing.
A dark-haired man, 30 to 35 years old, he spent a whole night in Novikova's bedroom.<eos> What do you think they were doing there?<eos> Solving crossword puzzles.<eos> That's it.<eos> In a general biological sense.<eos> We'll have to start monitoring Novikova.<eos> Coronel!<eos> Not now.<eos> And find out who could benefit from Novikov's death.<eos> Good luck.
-I want to talk to you.<eos> -I'm listening.<eos> -Why are you treating me like that?<eos> Do I perform my duties badly?<eos> -No.<eos> -Maybe I make mistakes in the documents or my clothes do not correspond to the dress code?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe I didn't do something right or didn't do something in general?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> A respectful attitude.
Maybe.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Well, what was it about?<eos> They searched through the whole office and messed about in the computer.<eos> The shareholders meeting will take place anyway.<eos> I received a letter.<eos> Novikova must sign everything before the meeting.<eos> She'll sign.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> One hundred percent.
I hope it's not for me?<eos> No, not for you.<eos> Let's talk business.<eos> Gena found something interesting in Novikov's PC.<eos> Officially, it was Novikov's wife, not him, who owned 8 % of shares.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> To avoid paying taxes,<eos> Novikov transferred the ownership to his wife, but so that she could not dispose of the shares.<eos> Could not?<eos> Up until this morning.
We wanted to ask you several questions.<eos> I am listening.<eos> Great watch.<eos> Probably expensive.<eos> -Have you come to talk about watches?<eos> I'll ask the outsiders to leave.<eos> Konstantin Sergeyevich, I'll come back later.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Guskov, where were you on the night between the 14th and the 15th?<eos> At home, at my place.
Dasha, please come to my office.<eos> Sorry, I've got things to do.<eos> Apart from everything else, Novikov was insured for the sum of 200,000 USD.<eos> Guess who's getting the money.<eos> Looks like an ideal crime.<eos> We'll probably have to close the case.<eos> The kid never threw a hairdryer in the water, but that morning he did.<eos> Why?<eos> Was that an accident or an addition to the ritual?<eos> What kind of ritual?
Out!<eos> I've worked three years for you, no weekends, and you...<eos> You....<eos> I gave her the keys.<eos> I came to pick up my things in the morning, and the door was open.<eos> I entered the house, and...<eos> Were they fighting?<eos> No, I would say it was exactly the opposite.<eos> -Where were you, this night?<eos> -At my place.
I found out about the strip club by accident.<eos> Was she ever threatened by the club's employees or clients?<eos> No.<eos> She didn't tell me about it.<eos> -What's the name of the club?<eos> -"Star."<eos> Where were you yesterday between 7 PM and 12 AM?<eos> I told you, I was laying bricks in my shed.<eos> Who can confirm that?<eos> Galya.
You're to pay for an hour.<eos> What do you mean, an hour?<eos> We've been here for fifteen minutes.<eos> Our minimum rate is for an hour.<eos> Or are you refusing to pay?<eos> Okay, get me a receipt...<eos> And put champagne on me.<eos> Colonel Lebedev?<eos> What's new in the investigation of Alyona Ligachova's murder?<eos> Nothing yet.
Have you seen any strangers in the house?<eos> No. No.<eos> Alyona was always alone.<eos> Yes, on thin dough.<eos> -Cured beef, salami...<eos> -Sausages.<eos> Sausages.<eos> And... a diet one, with corn.<eos> Apart from you, who else has keys from this apartment?<eos> Only Alyona.
It's time.<eos> We've shaken them off.<eos> We've got technical problems.<eos> Visual contact lost.<eos> They are continuing their movement according to the approved route.<eos> Now we've shaken them off.<eos> Done!<eos> Let's go.<eos> What kind of ID?<eos> -Russian Security Service.
Now, we lost him.<eos> Today, a decision was made at the general meeting to create a special investigation group for Crosby's case.<eos> This group will be lead... by Colonel Lebedev.<eos> Your operation is no longer top secret.<eos> Please, familiarize the group with the details of the case.<eos> We are listening to you with great attention.<eos> According to our data, Crosby is a CIA agent.<eos> He was noticed during an attempt to recruit a Russian IT expert for scientific and industrial espionage.<eos> Crosby was taken into operational research by our employee, Yelena Andreyeva.<eos> After a set of operational measures,
Scars and belies are a man's ornament.<eos> The last time Lena came for an appointment with me was a week ago.<eos> I haven't seen her since.<eos> When is she due to come the next time?<eos> Not earlier than the 20th week of pregnancy.<eos> -That is?<eos> -That is, in three months.<eos> If Andreyeva visits you earlier, please tell me about it.<eos> -Yes, sure.<eos> -Goodbye. Goodbye.
We agreed that...<eos> We agreed that it would be a table by the window.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> There was a mistake, we'll fix it now.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> No access to recording files.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> -Has it happened before?<eos> -No.
You've been indulging her since she was a kid.<eos> And here's the result:<eos> she turns 40 soon and doesn't have either a husband or a job.<eos> -Where are you going?<eos> -To the bathroom.<eos> Mom.<eos> Why are always destroying my life?<eos> Why do you hate me so?<eos> Please, pass me the napkin.<eos> God. So much fuss because of some onion.
Next one.<eos> What's with the damaged files?<eos> Unfortunately, it's impossible to restore them.<eos> He was caught red-handed at the crime scene.<eos> Why should I turn him in to anybody?<eos> Either you're telling me everything you know about this person or we have nothing to talk about.<eos> Okay, but I also have a condition.<eos> -We must interrogate him.<eos> -Okay.<eos> But only here, at our place.
I turn back, one more shot, and he falls.<eos> I couldn't understand what was happening.<eos> I can't tell you anything interesting apart from the fact that he had fried eggs with sausages and green peas for breakfast.<eos> This is a first for us.<eos> -Which number called his phone?<eos> -Blocked caller ID.<eos> Got it.<eos> And one more thing.<eos> He felt sick after the vaccination.<eos> What kind of vaccination?

Goodbye.<eos> Your chair! Please put it in the back.<eos> You?<eos> Are you studying Barkov's blood?<eos> Anything interesting?<eos> I am not totally sure.<eos> Do you see anything strange here?<eos> Hypoclamin.<eos> A medicine for hypertension.<eos> Nothing unusual.
I am listening to you.<eos> Sorry, but we need another Semyonov.<eos> We don't have another Semyonov in our center.<eos> What is the purpose of your visit?<eos> Colonel Lebedev, Special Investigation Bureau.<eos> Then who performed vaccination at our place?<eos> You had vaccination?<eos> That can't be.<eos> I am to visit you... the day after tomorrow.<eos> For seasonal vaccination against the flu.
What?<eos> If any information comes your way, please call me.<eos> Of course. Of course.<eos> The medical center form was most probably stolen.<eos> We are checking our employees for criminal complicity, -but...<eos> -That's clear. I studied the blood samples of guard Barkov who had shot himself.<eos> In these samples, I found a substance...<eos> Hypoclamin.<eos> A medicine for hypertension.<eos> Nothing special.
What's in it for me?<eos> Or do you think I did that?<eos> How could you even think that about me?<eos> We've known each other for so many years.<eos> Then why have you come?<eos> Irina says that you studied this Barkov's blood sample that's gone now.<eos> Was there anything unusual there?<eos> There was only hy-po-cla-min.<eos> A medicine used to treat hypertension.<eos> Nothing else.
Was there anything unusual there?<eos> There was only hy-po-cla-min.<eos> A medicine used to treat hypertension.<eos> Nothing else.<eos> I got it.<eos> Is that all from you?<eos> Then, with your permission, I'll go to bed.<eos> I'll go make a round.<eos> Will you stay here?<eos> Good night.
Do you know who are you?<eos> Who are you without me? !<eos> A nobody!<eos> A stuffed shirt.<eos> An empty spot.<eos> You are temporarily dismissed until the end of the investigation.<eos> No.<eos> I leave on my own.<eos> I will finish this case on my own.<eos> Without any minions.
People like you always come to a sticky end.<eos> Take him away.<eos> Come in.<eos> Well, here you are. Another victim of justice.<eos> The treatment didn't do any good to Klyuyev.<eos> He should be discharged, and the sooner, the better.<eos> But his brother paid for two more days, so...<eos> Okay, in two days, after Klyuyev's discharge, transfer Voskresenskaya to his box.<eos> I got it.<eos> -And no visitors.
Eyelids?<eos> There was cicatrical tissue present after the burns, with the shortening and eversion.<eos> In such cases, the burned eyelids are cut off, then patches of skin are cut out from the back surface of earflap.<eos> -Over here, and...<eos> -Thank you.<eos> You really helped us.<eos> If you need anything, we'll do it the best we can.<eos> I'll be waiting.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Goodbye.
Whatever it was, did you get it out of your system?<eos> Yep, all gone.<eos> The Sandpiper case?<eos> It's getting too big for HHM.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about there's an office in Santa Fe with your name on it.<eos> Good night, ladies.<eos> Get home safe.<eos> See you later, Gene.<eos> Good night.
Does it mean, uh...<eos> What?<eos> What...<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> If I take this job today, with Davis and Main does that mean that you and me...<eos> Is this... Is this gonna happen?<eos> Jimmy, I...<eos> I...<eos> One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.<eos> Nothing at all.
Thank you, Howard.<eos> Uh, Jimmy?<eos> Well, that was quick.<eos> No charge.<eos> Help me out here.<eos> Did I dream it, Or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?<eos> No one on god's green earth knew we had it.<eos> We could've split it 50/50.<eos> We could've gone home with $800,000... each!<eos> Tax-free!
Not him, not the guy who... Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?<eos> And waste everyone's time, including my own?<eos> Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?<eos> How hard you worked?<eos> All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?<eos> That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy.<eos> W...<eos> The what?
The name is Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street.<eos> Afternoon!
Papers!<eos> Papers!<eos> Here. How's The Blue Carbuncle doing?<eos> Very popular, Dr Watson.<eos> Is there going to be a proper murder next month?<eos> I'll have a word with the criminal classes. If you wouldn't mind.<eos> Is that him?<eos> Is he in there? Oh!<eos> No. No, no, not at all.<eos> Uh, good day to you.
All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume.<eos> Her perfume?<eos> Yes, her perfume which brings insight to me and disaster to you.<eos> How so?<eos> Because I recognised it and you did not.<eos> - Mary.<eos> - John.<eos> Why in God's name are you pretending to be a client?<eos> Because I could think of no other way to see my husband.<eos> Husband.
Enough!<eos> The stage is set, the curtain rises.<eos> We are ready to begin.<eos> Begin what?<eos> Sometimes to solve a case, one must first solve another.<eos> Well, you have a case then?<eos> A new one?<eos> An old one, very old.<eos> I shall have to go deep.<eos> Deep into what?
It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady.<eos> What brings you here in your off-duty hours?<eos> How do you know I'm off duty?<eos> Well, since your arrival, you've addressed over 40% of your remarks to my decanter.<eos> Watson, give the Inspector what he so clearly wants.<eos> So, Lestrade, what could we do for you?<eos> Oh, I'm not here on business, I just thought I'd drop by.<eos> Social call?<eos> Of course, just to wish you the compliments of the season.<eos> - Merry Christmas.

A moment.<eos> When was this?<eos> Yesterday morning.<eos> The bride's face, how is it described?<eos> White as death, mouth like a crimson wound.<eos> Poetry or truth?<eos> Well, many would say they're the same thing.<eos> Yes, idiots. Poetry or truth?<eos> I saw her face myself, afterwards.<eos> - After what?
Ah!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Sorry, sir, I'm rather behind my time this morning.<eos> Are you incapable of boiling an egg?<eos> The fires are rarely lit. There is dust everywhere.<eos> And you almost destroyed my boots scrapping the mud off them!<eos> If it wasn't my wife's business to deal with the staff, I would talk to you myself.<eos> Where is my wife?<eos> Begging your pardon, sir, but the mistress has gone out. - Out?<eos> At this hour of the morning?
And you've solved it already, I assume.<eos> Only in my head, I need you for the, uh...<eos> Legwork.<eos> Why not just tell us your solution?<eos> Where'd be the sport in that?<eos> Will you do it, Sherlock?<eos> I can promise you a superior distraction.<eos> On one condition. - Have another plum pudding.<eos> - There's one on the way.<eos> Two years, 11 months and four days.
It's, uh, nothing.<eos> I was mistaken.<eos> My dear, you've gone quite pale.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Eustace...<eos> Did you keep the envelope?<eos> My husband destroyed it. But it was blank.<eos> No name or address of any kind. Tell me, has Sir Eustace spent time in America?<eos> - No.<eos> - Not even before your marriage?
There's a message tied to the dagger, you must have seen it.<eos> - There's no message. - Yes!<eos> There was no message when I found the body.<eos> Holmes?<eos> What is it?<eos> Do you?<eos> Do I what?<eos> How did you get that?<eos> I left it at the crime scene.<eos> Crime scene?
His body was never recovered.<eos> To be expected when one pushes a maths professor over a waterfall.<eos> Pure reason toppled by sheer melodrama.<eos> Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions?<eos> Have you put on weight?<eos> You saw me only yesterday. Does that seem possible?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yet here I am, increased.<eos> What does that tell the foremost criminal investigator in England?<eos> - In England?
Never on a case.<eos> You promised me never on a case.<eos> No, I just said that in one of your stories.<eos> Listen. I'm happy to play the fool for you.<eos> I will run along behind you like some halfwit, making you look clever, if that's what you need.<eos> But dear God above! You will hold yourself to a higher standard.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because people need you to.<eos> What people, why?<eos> Because of your idiot stories?

Mr Holmes.
Why?<eos> So, tell me, where is she?<eos> You must tell me. What's going on?<eos> Oh, good old Watson. How would we fill the time if you didn't ask questions?<eos> Sherlock, tell me where my bloody wife is, you pompous prick, or I'll punch your lights out.<eos> Holmes, where is she?<eos> A de-sanctified church. She thinks she's found the solution.<eos> For no better reason than that, she's put herself in the path of considerable danger.<eos> Excellent choice of wife.<eos> What the devil?

Mrs Ricoletti persuaded a cab driver, someone who knew her, to intercept her husband outside his favourite opium den.<eos> Perfect stage for a perfect drama.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Emelia?<eos> A perfect positive identification.<eos> The late Mrs Ricoletti has returned from the grave, and a little skilled makeup, and you have nothing less than the wrath of a vengeful ghost.<eos> There was only one thing left to do.<eos> Swiftly, now.<eos> No tears.
Always here.<eos> Always together.<eos> You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty.<eos> I admire it.<eos> I concede it may be even be the equal of my own.<eos> I'm touched.<eos> I'm honoured.<eos> But when it comes to the matter of unarmed combat on the edge of a precipice, you're going in the water. Short-arse.<eos> Oh, you think you're so big and strong, Sherlock?<eos> Not with me.
You sure?<eos> Between you and me, John, I always survive the fall.<eos> But how?<eos> Elementary, my dear Watson.<eos> - Miss me?<eos> - Sherlock, you all right?<eos> Yes, of course I am.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> 'Cause you probably just OD'd. You should be in hospital.<eos> No time.
'Course he's dead. He blew his own brains out.<eos> No one survives that. I just went to the trouble of an overdose to prove it.<eos> Moriarty is dead.<eos> No question.<eos> More importantly,<eos> I know exactly what he is going to do next.<eos> Flying machines, these, uh, telephone contraptions, what sort of lunatic fantasy is that?<eos> It was simply my conjecture of what a future world might look like and how you and I might fit inside it.<eos> From a drop of water, a logician should be able to infer the possibility of an Atlantic or Niagara.<eos> Or a Reichenbach.

"The Invisible Army"?
To Paris.<eos> These people you're here to protect... are you sure they want you?<eos> I have my doubts.<eos> But I also have my orders.<eos> You follow all orders?<eos> I'm a soldier.<eos> That's how it's done.<eos> I looked up the Irish army to see how many wars they have been in.<eos> You know what I found?<eos> None.
Nothing, I've been working out.<eos> Donnie, listen to me. I'm at Grand Central Station staking out Dr. Baxter Stockman.<eos> Baxter Stockman!<eos> He graduated MIT at 15.<eos> He's got 134 patents.<eos> He's the lead scientist for TCRI. Big fan.<eos> The man's a genius.<eos> Yeah, well, he's a genius that's about to be in a lot of trouble.<eos> Look, I think Baxter Stockman is working with Shredder.<eos> Shredder.
And Trevor, I'm done working for the day.<eos> I just have to take this.<eos> Really quick. It's my boyfriend.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You have a boyfriend.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> But does your boyfriend know the difference between pi to the third decimal point, and pi to the fifteenth decimal point?<eos> It has truly been an honor to meet you.<eos> And you are really one of the greatest minds of our generation.<eos> Bye.
I like my bone crushing on ice.<eos> You like hockey, right? No.<eos> I like cage fighting.<eos> Cage fighting.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's him.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, speak from your heart.<eos> Hey, Mr. Shredder.<eos> Big fan of your work.<eos> Especially your early stuff.
You're right.<eos> To blend in with humans could compromise our strategic advantage.<eos> We have a system that works.<eos> We shouldn't mess with the formula.<eos> And Donnie.<eos> Listen.<eos> You can't say a word of this to the others.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> And to think, the entire universe, it all started with the Big Bang.<eos> Yeah, Beebs?
Only one piece left to recover.<eos> Get ready to take a trip, boys.<eos> You're going to Brazil.<eos> My Speedo's already packed!<eos> I didn't believe it, but then Donnie showed him it could really work.<eos> It was the coolest thing I've ever seen.<eos> It gave me hope.<eos> Maybe we don't have to be stuck down here forever, you know.<eos> So Leo told Donnie to keep it a secret.<eos> From us?
No, no, no. No, we're not doing...<eos> Listen, I'd love to help you guys out, but I can't.<eos> - I got concert tickets to a lunch.<eos> - Sweet key.<eos> - Does it go to something?<eos> - No, it's just the city.<eos> Vern, as the resident new guy in this band of freaky misfits, do yourself a favor, and just roll with it.<eos> Hey, new guy, all I do is roll with it.<eos> I've been rolling with it since you were wearing baby T-shirts because you were a baby.<eos> Police headquarters.
Get to the ground slowly.<eos> Get down!<eos> Jones, you've got to be kidding me.<eos> Put these two in holding.<eos> Jade, what we just saw stays in the department.<eos> The public doesn't need to know.<eos> It is all over the police scanner, they are hunting you.<eos> - What happened up there?<eos> - Tell him, Raph. Tell him how you broke rank and got us all exposed.<eos> For the most selfish reason.
They have the final piece and are heading back.<eos> Countdown to the big show is officially on.<eos> And we are ready for action!<eos> All systems are standing by.<eos> Can you taste it, Sensei Shredder?<eos> The magnificence of what we're about to do?<eos> Yummy, isn't it?<eos> Aren't there supposed to be, like, pretty stewardesses handing out warm hand towels and stuff?<eos> Not down here, Mikey.<eos> Not for us.
Hang on, Mikey.<eos> Lock in.<eos> Where's Raph?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, you got this.<eos> You got this.<eos> What would Vin Diesel do?<eos> No regret, no fear.<eos> No regret, no fear.<eos> No regret... No fear!
Bye, turtles!<eos> That's nice of them to say good-bye.<eos> - Heads up!<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> Real team effort.<eos> If you're gonna press charges, just press charges.<eos> And you still owe her a phone call.<eos> I don't owe anybody anything until you tell me where those turtle things came from.<eos> From New Hampshire.
Look, The Falcon is still The Falcon. I just may have gotten by with a little help from my friends.<eos> These four are the ones who took Shredder down the first time.<eos> I was kind of more of a wingman.<eos> We've been doing our part to protect this city from the shadows.<eos> And we think we have something to offer.<eos> - We're gonna need...<eos> - Strategy.<eos> Instinct.<eos> Logic.<eos> And boatloads of heart.
I'm pregnant.<eos> Pregnant, what?<eos> Claire, that's wonderful.<eos> How is that... how is that...<eos> No.<eos> It's Jamie's.<eos> No.<eos> I'm carrying another man's child, Frank.<eos> You need to think about that, and what that means.<eos> For all of us.
Raised in a lie.<eos> No, with a father.<eos> A living, breathing man.<eos> Not the echo of a memory that they can never catch.<eos> Not a ghost.<eos> Precisely.<eos> You have other conditions?<eos> Only one.<eos> While I draw breath on this earth, I cannot share you with another man.<eos> No more research.
I thought you were going to knock people over, trying to get off that gangway.<eos> I couldn't take another moment on that rolling, creaking, leaking tub.<eos> So I guess a trip to Boston is out of the question?<eos> Not unless ye want to bury me at sea.<eos> Well, there were times I thought it would be the merciful thing to do.<eos> France.<eos> Reeks of frogs, just as I remember it.<eos> I think you'll find what you smell is fish, and I doubt there's a seaport in all the world that smells any different.<eos> I'll arrange for some rooms for us somewhere.<eos> Somewhere away from all this stink.
That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.<eos> And in this I will.<eos> I'll, uh, I'll write a letter to Jared asking him for his help.<eos> What?<eos> What the hell are we going to tell Murtagh?<eos> So that's all you'll tell me, hmm?<eos> Nothing more?
Yeah, it's okay. The night of October 24th, did you encounter the defendant and Andrea on West 87th Street?<eos> I don't think I want to answer that question.<eos> You kind of have to, Mr. Williams.<eos> Not true, not true.<eos> It's called the Fifth Amendment.<eos> You're concerned about self-incrimination?<eos> What for?<eos> I ain't do nothing. Then do us all a favor and answer the question.<eos> I don't think you right on that.<eos> But...
I know guys put it out in their mouth.<eos> Just before you put it out, you knocked on the window, like people do to say "Roll it down."<eos> And we saw that she didn't roll it down.<eos> Do you think she might have been afraid of you?<eos> Oh, no one's afraid of me.<eos> I am.<eos> After what you said to me at the mortuary, remember?<eos> Am I right, that's inadmissible?<eos> That's "heresy," right?<eos> Something like that.
That's not the kind of help I mean.<eos> Hey, John.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry I didn't make it to your party.<eos> You mean my wake?<eos> What you should do is come work with me in cardholder security.<eos> I swear, it's the best job I ever had.<eos> Listen, I need a favor.<eos> I need the names and addresses without a subpoena.<eos> No problem.
No...<eos> I'm not discussing it.<eos> Jurors, I'll remind you not to discuss this case with anyone, and keep your TVs, computers, and iPads off.<eos> Have a nice, electronics-free weekend.<eos> I'll see you on Monday.<eos> Hey, Mike.<eos> The shooting in the strip club last Yom Kippur.<eos> What was the vic's name again?<eos> Are you still here?<eos> What the fuck?
I'm not her boyfriend.<eos> And now I'm leaving.<eos> Now you're just being stupid.<eos> It's better for you you were seeing her.<eos> That explains your semen in her bedroom.<eos> If you weren't her boyfriend, then what the fuck, Ray?<eos> Don't be an idiot.<eos> I know you know what's next.<eos> If you weren't there, then where were you?<eos> Home.
beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> We hear that term a lot.<eos> But what does it really mean, huh?<eos> What's its definition?<eos> It doesn't have one.<eos> It's what we think, and as much as what we think, what we feel.<eos> And what we feel and what you feel will determine what happens to the rest of this young man's life.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nothing.
I'm so happy you're home.<eos> You thought I killed her.<eos> Never.<eos> Okay, Mom.<eos> So, right now at the 21st Precinct, there's someone in the pen.<eos> They'll take him down to The Tombs, to court, to Rikers.<eos> Meanwhile, there's someone else in the pen.<eos> Tomorrow someone else, the next day someone else.<eos> No one's even thinking about you anymore.<eos> Except everybody here.
It's... They gave it a negative review.<eos> No, like it's a negative four out of 10.<eos> Positive 10, I assume.<eos> Pitchfork can be kind of pretentious, though, so...<eos> What?<eos> You ain't gonna knock my hustle.<eos> Let's look at another one.<eos> Let's pull it up.<eos> Rolling Stone.<eos> Okay, um... Out of four possible stars,
This one's a mask.<eos> It's still me.<eos> It's a hat.<eos> You know, we were going places as a band.<eos> We had plans as a band.<eos> Style Boyz, that's three guys, not two.<eos> It doesn't work with two.<eos> You know, it's like a tricycle.<eos> You take away one of the wheels, what have you got?<eos> Nothing.
Get over it.<eos> When the Style Boyz broke up...<eos> Damn.<eos> The only other time I remember being that sad was when they killed Josh Charles on The Good Wife.<eos> I'm a Style Boy for life<eos> Y'all ready for this?<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> Welcome to the future, bitches.<eos> That's Conner's song.<eos> Okay, both sides.
- AC.<eos> Did you say Macy's?<eos> Macy's?<eos> Macy's? - Air conditioning.<eos> Sometimes Conner just gets an idea, and he runs with it, you know, and he's right, like, 99.9% of the time, so you've just got to trust that he knows what he's doing.<eos> So I understand why he, you know, did the whole Aquaspin thing.<eos> Touring is expensive today.<eos> Why you think I do the A$ap Crunchables?<eos> This is Gary Sikes. This is the label photographer.<eos> Gentlemen.

Next level. You would have to be the best prankster of all time to think of something like this, and, well, shit, that's me.<eos> Maybe I did do it.<eos> No, I didn't do it, or did I?<eos> No, I didn't, or maybe I did not do it.<eos> Did you? I didn't do it, or I did.<eos> Who knows?<eos> I don't.<eos> Conner, don't worry.<eos> Don't worry. This is not news.<eos> What the fuck?
Seal!<eos> Seal! Shit!<eos> Oh, my God, you got him, dude!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I've been in this situation before.<eos> How do you think I got these scars?<eos> From wolves?<eos> Fucking wolves.<eos> Now let's get out of here.<eos> What the fuck?
No.<eos> God, he looks like a caveman.<eos> Look at this fool.<eos> He's about to murder somebody.<eos> I think it's just the lighting in the limo.<eos> What?<eos> No, seriously, I think that that's just his resting face.<eos> He's just relaxing.<eos> So, what, he'll just apologize to me, and I'm supposed to forgive him, and then we go back to being a big happy family?<eos> Something like that, yeah.
Yeah, he needs to forget her.<eos> Yeah. Yeah. I love that movie.<eos> So good.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> It means a lot that you came out.<eos> I'm glad I came, too.<eos> For real.<eos> That's good, man.<eos> Nice.<eos> - What the fuck?
Owen.<eos> Lawrence.<eos> Conner.<eos> I just...<eos> That's for you, man, to borrow, you know.<eos> I figured you could take a bunch of pics of you holding it and stuff.<eos> You could post them or whatever.<eos> All right, so now we're cool.<eos> Lawrence!<eos> What the fuck, man?
Wanna take her home Make her my wife<eos> Knew she was a freak When she started talking<eos> She said<eos> I'm a Style Boy for life<eos> Should we tell them?<eos> Yeah. Tell them, man.<eos> We made a new song at the farm.<eos> Yeah, we found Lawrence's journals, and they were just amazing.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Just full of incredible thoughts.

I swear, my mind Blows my mind<eos> Incredible<eos> Let me see that Donkey Roll<eos> Donkey Roll<eos> Let me see that Donkey Roll<eos> Incredible thoughts<eos> Donkey Roll Incredible thoughts<eos> Let me see that Donkey Roll<eos> Incredible thoughts Incredible minds<eos> Too many great ideas inside
- FBI?<eos> - They're all over the place.<eos> - Can you see Hutchinson? - Yeah, I saw him.<eos> Are they speaking to him? No, they took him out.<eos> He's dead.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> - Welcome to the shit show.<eos> - Ready for you guys inside.<eos> How long after the robbery till the first officers were on scene?<eos> - Twenty-five minutes.
Possession, possession, petty theft, disturbing the peace.<eos> Really?<eos> - Anybody else smell horseshit here?<eos> - This guy's a thug.<eos> There's no way he pulled this off.<eos> - These guys are pros.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> They operated with precision.<eos> We need the evidence, and where is the evidence?<eos> - Still with Mims.
These guys move better than a SWAT team.<eos> No, if I were looking for thugs, my first suspects would be you assholes.<eos> This is not gonna hold up, these guys will be out in 15 minutes.<eos> Jackson's lawyer claims she has a liquor store tape of James making a purchase at the time of the robbery.<eos> And who the fuck are you?<eos> Number three on that list of people who outrank you.<eos> Well, congratulations, gentlemen, you've just been played, it's called disinformation, that print was put there on purpose and you've given our suspects a nine hour head start.<eos> Well done.<eos> Hey, by the way... how much cash did you guys recover from James Jackson's place?<eos> - No cash.

It would be convenient enough for him to do his banking at Hubert National, why, what are you thinking?<eos> I'm thinking it's pretty fitting they're having their little bitch fest in a graveyard.<eos> Heard you met with Vanessa Adler.<eos> - Yeah, you know her?<eos> - Yeah, I banged her a couple times.<eos> No, we bounce information back and forth once in awhile.<eos> - She actually went to college with my wife.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you married?<eos> How long?<eos> - Almost 10 years.
Thank you.<eos> Why didn't you come sooner with that information?<eos> I called right away, you guys were the first ones to get back to me.<eos> No, no, this is great.<eos> Thanks for your time, we'll be in touch.<eos> Hey, guys, listen.<eos> I was thinking about applying to the Academy in the Fall and... I was just wondering if maybe you'd put in a good word, tell 'em I helped you out.<eos> Yeah, we'll jump right on that.<eos> Special Agent Wells here will personally inform the FBI Director.<eos> Maybe even the President.
You think T.J. Jackson had a small unit, sir, or a... big ol' large unit?<eos> Stocky, you're a third grader trapped in a grown man's body, shut the fuck up.<eos> All right, anyone else?<eos> Any non-comedians?<eos> Can you think of any point they may be trying to make, anybody?<eos> All right, daddy's turn.<eos> Here we have an entirely different platoon not to be confused with T.J. Jackson's.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Hutchinson, the manager killed at the first robbery.<eos> What about him?
What about him?<eos> - Senator Cook.<eos> - Before he was a senator,<eos> Cook served in The Gulf War, he was the commander of this platoon.<eos> - Recognize him?<eos> - Dagley.<eos> - He was in Cook's platoon.<eos> - Exactly, as was Hutchinson.<eos> A very young David Dagley, now let's fast forward to 2011... where Dagley is the commander of T.J. Jackson's Ranger Unit, the unit that we all know went rogue and killed Alexander Hubert.<eos> - Everyone in the unit except for Dagley.
What now, Agent Montgomery?<eos> Surely even your little mind understands this country's so corrupt. What are you doing?<eos> You can't touch me here.<eos> Or else I could have you killed.<eos> That, and it wouldn't cost me the price of one of your cheap suits.<eos> You really don't like my suits?<eos> It's alright.<eos> Well...<eos> You're not drunk are you?<eos> One sip of this?
Don't you see how cool this is?<eos> Erik is turning into a superhero...<eos> What's happening to you... Must have something to do with the cells renewing faster.<eos> Like your body is being overclocked or something. So that's why I have x-ray vision?<eos> You're an idiot. Erik...<eos> Even if the cancer seems to have stabilized... We need to keep testing. So we know we that we can actually control this.<eos> If this can save you... Imagine what else it could lead to!<eos> Alright... cheers for the guinea pig then!<eos> So where do we start?<eos> From the beginning.
And where this breach now in our fortunes made<eos> May readily be stopped.<eos> Now, by my sword, thou hast fought well today.<eos> So have we all.<eos> There is one old supporter of the King<eos> Is either slain or wounded dangerously.<eos> That this is true, father, behold his blood.<eos> Why, that's my son!<eos> Did anyone see or hear The fate of Somerset,<eos> The foulest canker of the blood-red rose?
I was a woeful looker-on<eos> When as the noble Duke of York was slain.<eos> By many hands your father was subdued,<eos> But only slaughtered by the ireful arm<eos> Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen,<eos> Who crowned the gracious Duke in high despite,<eos> Laughed in his face, and when with grief he wept,<eos> The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks<eos> A napkin steeped in the harmless blood Of sweet young Edmund, by rough Clifford slain.<eos> After many scorns, many foul taunts,
His queen, my Lord?<eos> Sweet widow... .. by my state, I swear to thee,<eos> I mean no more than what my soul intends...<eos> And that is to enjoy thee for my love.<eos> And that is more than I will yield unto.<eos> List to me, widow...<eos> I did mean my queen.<eos> Welcome, brave Warwick!<eos> What brings thee to France?<eos> From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
To Henry's body, and supply his place.<eos> Then for the first of all your chief affairs<eos> Let me entreat, for I command no more,<eos> That Margaret, your Queen<eos> Be sent for, to return from France with speed.<eos> It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.<eos> And Exeter, what youth is that,<eos> Of whom you seem to have so tender care?<eos> My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.<eos> After yourself and your young son the Prince,
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust.<eos> What, Warwick, wilt thou leave thy tent and fight?<eos> Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?<eos> Alas, I am not cooped here for defence.<eos> I will unto the field presently,<eos> And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.<eos> Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.<eos> Come, Lords, to the field,<eos> Saint George, and victory!<eos> Forward!
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,<eos> And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,<eos> To wit, an indigested and deformed lump.<eos> Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,<eos> To signify thou camest to bite the world.<eos> And, if the rest be true which I have...<eos> I'll hear no more!<eos> Die, prophet in thy speech!<eos> For this amongst the rest, was I ordained.<eos> Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
- And no one knows that we're alive?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Then who just sent us a message?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Belu is your favorite color.<eos> Try that one first.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> Oh.
Hey, what're you doing?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> He don't deserve to breathe the Belter folks' air.<eos> Watch your eyes, cop.<eos> I wanna kill that guy.<eos> Remember the Cant?<eos> His name's Filat Kothari,<eos> Loca Greiga muscle.<eos> Sayonara, Ceres, that's my going-away present to you!<eos> Onto bigger and better things.
- How?<eos> - There's an auxiliary tight-beam transmitter mounted on Toro 5.<eos> I think it's just outside their jamming range.<eos> I should be able to relay the station's camera footage and broadcast out.<eos> My name is Marama Brown.<eos> Four days ago, the miners working for the Anderson-Hyosung Corporation took control of this station, in an effort to protest the treatment of our children.<eos> _<eos> Sitara mail.<eos> This is my daughter, Kiri.<eos> She and, uh...
_<eos> _<eos> You have my solemn promise that you will not be harmed.<eos> And you will be granted safe harbor on Tycho.<eos> Since you've chosen to remain anonymous,<eos> I can only hope you have no hostile intent.<eos> Regardless, you will need to change your transponder code in order to avoid detection.<eos> The instructions are embedded in this message.<eos> Do not deviate from them in any way.<eos> Safe journey.
We could be a supernova a few seconds from now.<eos> Well, we won't have to worry about Tycho, will we?<eos> We need to give the ship a new name to complete the override.<eos> Screamin' Firehawk.<eos> Yeah, let's advertise that we're a gun ship.<eos> Flying Alamo.<eos> - No.<eos> - Give me something, please.<eos> Rocinante.<eos> Huh?
You street rat.<eos> Did you pattern the charges?<eos> Yeah, yeah, just like you said...<eos> Time to make some money, bachemang.<eos> Once all the shooting got started, it was over pretty quick.<eos> The Martians barely knew what hit 'em.<eos> The Donnager and the Cant were attacked by the same class of stealth warships.<eos> You will have to testify.<eos> Testify?<eos> To the UN Security Council.
I'll barely make enough to cover the trip.<eos> Attention Xinglong, this is MCRN Scipio Africanus power down and prepare to be boarded.<eos> Who they want?<eos> Cards are on the table.<eos> I provided a ship for an OPA recon mission out of Ceres, which disappeared.<eos> The name of that ship is the Scopuli.<eos> That's right.<eos> I need this frigate to retrieve the lone survivor.<eos> - Lionel Polanski.<eos> - Who?
Oh, come on, there must be something...<eos> - Hey! - Leave him alone.<eos> Dzeet! Dzeet! Dzeet!<eos> Dzeet! Why are you doing this?<eos> Impound our haul and there's nothing left for your taxman.<eos> Oh, are we being too hard on you?<eos> Should we cut you a break?<eos> We are just tryin' to feed our families, okay?<eos> I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you...<eos> Absolutely nothing.
Oh?<eos> Hey!<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> He didn't mean...<eos> Hey.<eos> I went easy on you before.<eos> But now...<eos> You're not gonna pass through the restricted zone on your way home, "bosmain."<eos> We can't go around.<eos> Not enough fuel!
Get himself tangled up in this mess?<eos> You're out of your ever-lovin' mind, you think you can trust that guy.<eos> Look, I only committed myself.<eos> Fred Johnson offered to crew me up.<eos> You guys'll be safe here on Tycho till all this blows over, then you can go back to your lives.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> You're using his crew?<eos> How do you know he's not going to space you the second you get out there?<eos> Because you're going to rig the Roci so it only responds to my command.<eos> For God's sake.
Thoughtful...<eos> Sometimes, a whiny little prick.<eos> We're going to miss you, pal.<eos> Wherever you are,<eos> I hope no one there needs medical attention.<eos> Yam seng!<eos> Mmm.<eos> To those brave, crazy bastards who got us off the Donnager.<eos> Hey.<eos> A little respect.
At the time?<eos> With all those bullets flying?<eos> Probably not.<eos> So, what's next for Naomi Nagata? When all this blows over?<eos> Nawe Nada.<eos> I'm using my last remaining brain cells, to try and kill my last remaining brain cells.<eos> So let's get to work on that, shall we?<eos> I got it.<eos> I never killed anyone before.<eos> Right...
Vibrational resonances all across the spectrum...<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Look at this thing.<eos> What the hell am I looking at?<eos> You're looking at, I don't know, some kind of bio-weapon?<eos> Where'd this recording come from?<eos> Phoebe, that's what I think.<eos> - Phoebe Station.<eos> - I meant where'd you get it?<eos> Julie Mao.
Thank you.<eos> You want anything, Tom?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Can you give us a moment?<eos> That's James?<eos> That's all of us.<eos> Brave woman, being part of a family co-op.<eos> It's hard enough for one husband to get along with me.<eos> We try not to keep secrets.<eos> Good for any relationship.
It's nothin' personal.<eos> Just like that, huh?<eos> Like water's wet. Sky's up.<eos> Must be nice to have life all figured out like that.<eos> It has nothing to do with me.<eos> We're just caught up in the churn, is all.<eos> I have no idea what you just said.<eos> This boss I used to work for in Baltimore, he called it the churn.<eos> When the rules of the game change.<eos> What game?
I think you're full of shit, lady.<eos> Jimmy is my son.<eos> He has all eight of us in him, but I carried him in my belly for nine months.<eos> He is mine!<eos> You have no idea what you're playing with here.<eos> Just arrest me.<eos> You put all your hopes on your son?<eos> I pressured mine to join the Marines or I wouldn't pay for his education.<eos> First step in a career of public service.<eos> Like mine and my father's.
Listen to me, you guys give that skiff the proper set of codes and they have to back off.<eos> For all they know, it's some training exercise to, to weed out the cowboys.<eos> It should be in an operations locker somewhere on this deck, somewhere right here.<eos> Right, right here.<eos> Right here where?<eos> You gotta have the code book!<eos> All right, sweetheart.<eos> Show me where the operations locker is.<eos> Where did you get that key?<eos> From Lopez.
All right, sweetheart.<eos> Show me where the operations locker is.<eos> Where did you get that key?<eos> From Lopez.<eos> _<eos> Donkey balls.<eos> Avi.<eos> Cash me out, pal.<eos> That's a lot of winnings.<eos> For a lifetime of losing.
My specialty.<eos> Good luck, Miller.<eos> We've been trying to save this land ever since before Jimmy was born.<eos> He was gonna take over for us.<eos> The way we raised him, he grew up thinking he was alive because the land needed him.<eos> That's a terrible thing to tell a child.<eos> But he never complained, because it was what we all wanted.<eos> By the time he was a teenager, he was reading all the briefs Tom wrote.<eos> He went to the hearings, stood at the gates to greet whatever goons the government sent to harass us.<eos> - No offense.
Hey, let's get something straight.<eos> Any Martians come through that airlock, we subdue and take them prisoner.<eos> Nobody's dying.<eos> So, they'll have a chance to ping the mothership?<eos> That ain't my plan.<eos> That's a two-man patrol skiff.<eos> I'm gonna take 'em down clean and fast, then we're gonna burn like hell somewhere safe.<eos> Figure out what our next move is from there.<eos> Do you know how many Martians died getting us off the Donnager?<eos> Ship that size?
For a series of circumstances we don't even understand?<eos> We're beyond circumstantial here, Chrisjen.<eos> And we can't afford to wait for the next disaster in Holden's wake.<eos> Things are fragile enough out there right now.<eos> When Holden gets to Eros, he's done.<eos> Field trip's over.<eos> I need you back here.<eos> Shit.<eos> Well, scopes are clear, chief.<eos> No more patrols between here and Eros station.
You know, and with great risk comes...<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know the rest.<eos> Yeah.<eos> _<eos> Ah, who knows.<eos> You guys might be getting out at just the right time.<eos> _<eos> Only thing we got here is the lovely charted belt asteroid<eos> Bravo-Alpha 834024112.<eos> No life pod, no emergency habitat, nothing.
Kinda busy.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> I was hoping you could tell us.<eos> Looks dead.<eos> Oh, yeah, you're a great help.<eos> EMF reflection, practically zero across all main bands.<eos> It's nice stealth tech.<eos> We already figured that out.<eos> Who has ships like that?<eos> Mars, of course.
Yup.<eos> All video feeds are lookin' good.<eos> This is bullshit.<eos> - You can't just treat me like some...<eos> - "Canary in a coal mine?"<eos> All right, people.<eos> Hold on to your helmets.<eos> Docking tunnel is engaged.<eos> Connection... Is good.<eos> After you.
I'm going to check Engineering.<eos> See what shape the reactor's in.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> Hey, Amos, take the flight deck.<eos> We need to check the ship's systems and logs.<eos> Take him with you.<eos> He'll be useful.<eos> Come along, tweety bird.<eos> Flight deck's gotta be upstairs.<eos> After you.
He took his own life.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> We can finish later.<eos> We can finish now.<eos> We're going in for a closer look.<eos> Alex, did your drone turn anything up?<eos> Negative.<eos> There's not another soul on board.<eos> No bodies, no people.

If this "Lionel Polanski" is going to be anywhere, it's gonna be there.<eos> I know that place.<eos> I got hooks in systems all over Eros.<eos> Let me help you find him.<eos> And if I do, you let me walk.<eos> Okay.<eos> When we find Polanski.<eos> Not before.<eos> Anybody object to us turning that ship into scrap?<eos> - Hell no.
Hey, give me a number four, bare, in a bowl.<eos> Uh...<eos> Just give me a coffee.<eos> Two number fours.<eos> It's on me.<eos> All right, well, make mine the burrito-style, you know, regular.<eos> - And, uh, plus the coffee.<eos> All right, Semi.<eos> You could trace the girl.<eos> For me.
Previouslyon the expanse...<eos> Sayonara, ceres.<eos> That'smygoing-away presenttoyou.<eos> Ontobigger andbetterthings.

Only when you are clean will you know my power.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> It sounds like a party.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!<eos> This is so great. I can't thank you enough.<eos> I feel alive again.<eos> And look at all the cans.<eos> We're gonna be rich! You got to drop it with the cans, all right?<eos> Nobody cares about the cans.<eos> Really. Yep. Oh, okay, well, what about... these cans?
Yeah, but that guy was, like, saying a bunch of, like, really personal information about us.<eos> Like, how does he know that?<eos> Right.<eos> That's how it works. Why's he talking about us?<eos> There's, like, hundreds of people out here.<eos> Well, we're the most important thing that's happening right now.<eos> Look, I-I think I got something that's gonna clear this all up for you.<eos> Meet my race team.<eos> Where'd these guys come from?<eos> Switzerland?
'Cause I'll-I'll punish you.<eos> All right, now go limber up, and I'll-I'll meet you at the chair.<eos> Let's go, guys. March, march, march.<eos> Wow.<eos> Uh, I got to hand it to you, looks like you got a pretty good team.<eos> I think so, too.<eos> Yeah, yeah. Uh, look, I don't... I don't get anything that's happening.<eos> So, uh, I'm out, you know what I mean?<eos> And maybe we should drink some beer, eat some snow, and just...<eos> What the hell, man?
I see your nose is not purely decorative, Madonna.<eos> As for the smell, well, um... that, actually, is blood.<eos> But not crocodile blood.<eos> So much cynicism in one so young.<eos> No, in fact... it's pig's blood, Madonna... pigs being so much more available than crocodiles.<eos> Fortunately, the ladies and gentlemen of the Court are more trusting and foolish than you are.<eos> - I was wondering... - Hmm.<eos> Do you carry Nepeta cataria?<eos> Someone having trouble sleeping?<eos> My husband.
I'm a healer.<eos> Ah... a healer.<eos> I see.<eos> The size and overall look is as stated.<eos> Your name wouldn't happen to be Claire Fraser, would it?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Are you a mind reader as well?<eos> No, but I have an excellent memory for names, and, uh... yes... I've recently heard yours in connection with your rather dramatic arrival on our shores.<eos> Comte St. Germain told me all about your part in the burning of his pox-afflicted vessel,<eos> "The Patagonia."
_<eos> You cannot blame them for gawking.<eos> Dueling is outlawed in France.<eos> No doubt they think we mean to run each other through.<eos> Yet another wrong to mark against this misery of a country.<eos> Would you look at me?<eos> I'm out of breath already after hardly an hour.<eos> It's the air.<eos> Arses and armpits!<eos> Too many people.
Forget about him, Daniel.<eos> Life is full of Mr Maltards.<eos> It is men like you who will build the future.<eos> - Thank you, Mr...<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> Very good, thank you.<eos> - Have they left?<eos> - Yes, sir, a few moments ago.<eos> Uh, the bill, please.<eos> Goodbye, sir.
- Yes, sir, a few moments ago.<eos> Uh, the bill, please.<eos> Goodbye, sir.<eos> "I said so to Helmut Kohl last week."<eos> Daniel!<eos> - Dad!<eos> - My little angel!<eos> You've grown in one week!<eos> - How are you, darling?<eos> - Good and you, my love?
- Good and you, my love?<eos> So, young man?<eos> - What's with the hat?<eos> - It's Mitterrand's hat.<eos> I can see that.<eos> I mean, it's actually his hat.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'll explain at home.<eos> - How do I look?<eos> - Not like Indiana Jones.
Since you'll never leave your wife, I'm leaving you.<eos> Six years you've strung me along, summer and winter,<eos> 45 weekends a year when you weren't with your family.<eos> Forty-five weekends making love in shameful secret.<eos> Empty promises... just like my bosses.<eos> Promises but no promotion.<eos> I'm still on the same rung.<eos> My title: official mistress!<eos> A glorified whore - on the cheap.<eos> Forty-five weekends of hope...
- What else is there? - Le Chasseur Frangais?<eos> Exactly!<eos> Le Chasseur Frangais!<eos> For how long should it run?<eos> My entire life!<eos> This hat is driving you mad!<eos> I think I am going mad, but without it I'm nothing and I'll amount to nothing.<eos> Here!<eos> Goodbye, hat.<eos> Fair journey.
Yes, hello.<eos> That's right, my ad.<eos> That's right, "FM".<eos> Black.<eos> You lost it?<eos> A tramp?<eos> A tramp has it now?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> I don't know why I picked it up.<eos> Probably because of the scents.
And Agua Brava by Puig.<eos> P ace Rabanne.<eos> Poundland for her.<eos> - Eau de Rochas.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - First by Van Cleef Arpels. - Spot on.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Air du temps by Nina Ricci.<eos> - Lacoste?<eos> - My boyfriend's aftershave.
- Set the world on fire!<eos> - Set the world on fire!<eos> Set the world on fire!<eos> Pierre Aslan on fire with lncendie!<eos> I'm late.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Well, and you?<eos> - Very well.<eos> - How are you? - Good?<eos> Still bankrupt?
Pour me a glass.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Here's to our new understanding.<eos> The new wine may not have arrived, but the new boss has arrived.<eos> And I promise you.<eos> I promise you...<eos> How about we drink instead of talk?<eos> Speech! Speech!<eos> Speech!<eos> No speech, no speech.
I assume you've seen the initials inside?<eos> Yes.<eos> And so, unless I'm mistaken, it doesn't belong to you?<eos> I assume you know who it belongs to?<eos> If you don't mind, I will keep this hat.<eos> I'd like to give it myself.<eos> We're at the Hotel San Luca.<eos> Daniel Mercier.<eos> Of course, Mr Mercier.<eos> Good day.
It is pitiful. I really want lick it. and stroke it.<eos> If that is so...<eos> Why don't you have a feel... of her whipping you.<eos> The duchess with a whip in her hand from high she swings down.<eos> Whip.<eos> Another one continues.<eos> Whip.<eos> Whip.<eos> My penis, is swollen from the pain.<eos> Ten minutes.
I know it's not your birthday.<eos> This is for being such a good girl.<eos> -What?<eos> -l've been a good girl?<eos> You're a very good girl.<eos> Take it.<eos> Do you think EIisa's okay?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I wonder if she's okay at home.<eos> -Who?

I'm just giving you the heads up in case they come calling. I'm telling you this, just in case.<eos> Maybe you should lay low.<eos> Yo, my nigga.<eos> I already told you, that shit ain't up for discussion.<eos> hall Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<eos> Now, and at the hour of our death.<eos> Amen.<eos> -My love.<eos> -See you next week.<eos> Good-bye.
His name is manuel de Ia Cruz.<eos> I don't know these people.<eos> I don't know him.<eos> You don't know this guy either?<eos> -l don't know anything.<eos> We don't know those people.<eos> And I guess you don't know that he was killed a few days ago.<eos> well... What a shame.<eos> He's so young, too.<eos> Too much violence with these kids.
It's a miracle. It's crazy.<eos> I don't know how it happened.<eos> But how can you be pregnant?<eos> José stayed in Iraq for a year.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> It's a miracle!<eos> Remember what I told you I saw that night in the subway?<eos> It was so incredible words can't describe it.<eos> I believe that night, God and the blessed mother did something special for me.<eos> For all of us.
But-But Cindy, I have to tell you something.<eos> I'm like in love with my janitor.<eos> Is that sick?<eos> Have you ever had a sexual fantasy about your handyman?<eos> Well, it's awkward because he's literally like cleaning the shit out of my toilet bowl right now.<eos> And I don't think I'm at my most alluring.<eos> Yeah, maybe you're right.<eos> It's not like I met him socially.<eos> Okay, thank you, Cindy.<eos> Okay, like 20 minutes.
Bye.<eos> All right, all set.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Can I give you a tip?<eos> You mean like a suggestion?<eos> No, I mean, like, a tip.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, good night.
All right, all set.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Can I give you a tip?<eos> You mean like a suggestion?<eos> No, I mean, like, a tip.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, good night.<eos> Good night. Good bye.
You can see him if you want.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> Went into cardiac arrest.<eos> You know his heart was very weak at this point, and it just gave out.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't get here in time, but as I told you on the phone... Aw, fuck this.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's okay, buddy.<eos> That's perfectly all right.<eos> Did anybody call my uncle?<eos> His Uncle Donny. Ah.
Get off.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Better.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You sound better.<eos> So, did you guys actually use the fishing tackle?<eos> Yeah, we really did.<eos> Patty got a humongous bluefish.<eos> Eighteen pounds.
She'll apologize later.<eos> They're already left.<eos> Lee...<eos> Thanks for hosting, kid-Tell Randi we're sorry.<eos> Drink and drive.<eos> We're so sorry.<eos> You see Jupiter?<eos> Keep you eyes on the road.<eos> Hey, Tommy.<eos> Goodnight, Joe.
Yeah, I don't know, but I wish you'd figure it out 'cause I'm freezing my ass off.<eos> You don't have a normal winter coat?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.<eos> Why don't you wear gloves with real fingers on them?<eos> Oh, God, fuck.<eos> Oh, fuck, where'd I park this motherfucking car?<eos> Damn, it's cold.<eos> Why?<eos> What's the matter with your winter jacket?<eos> Seriously, Patty?
This is a homemade Cabonara sauce?<eos> Jesus. Shut up.<eos> No.<eos> You could've fooled me.<eos> Jesus.<eos> What? What?<eos> You're such a kiss ass.<eos> Sandy.<eos> Because I appreciate your mother's cooking?<eos> Good night.
I don't want to talk about it.<eos> All my friends are here.<eos> I'm on the hockey team.<eos> I'm on the basketball team.<eos> I got to maintain our boat now.<eos> I work on George's boat two days a week.<eos> I got two girlfriends, and I'm in a band.<eos> You're a janitor in Quincy. What the hell do you care where you live?<eos> I got to go to sleep.<eos> Good night.
That's—<eos> What's important is you remembering your life.<eos> Okay.<eos> What is life?<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> This is you.<eos> This is your body, and— and that's where your brain is, and that's where you're going to remember something.<eos> Humans have evolved over millions and millions of years to be this way.<eos> - We do all this stuff, because it helps us survive...<eos> kind of.
No, no, no, the other people will stare at you if you sing, so you listen to your own music.<eos> - Oh. - Here.<eos> ♪ If it hadn't been ♪<eos> ♪ For Cotton Eye Joe ♪<eos> ♪ I'd be married ♪<eos> ♪ A long time ago... ♪<eos> As you listen... stare out the window.<eos> Oh. And I watch the world go by.<eos> ♪ Wasn't for Cotton Eye ♪<eos> ♪ Cotton Eye Joe... ♪
Because I'm just a scared, ugly, useless person.<eos> But maybe everyone's a little bit ugly.<eos> Yeah, maybe we're all just ugly, dying sacks of shit, and maybe all it'll take is one person to just be okay with that, and then the whole world will be dancing and singing and farting, and everyone will feel a little bit less alone.<eos> Manny, you have no idea how nice that sounds.<eos> Hello.<eos> Are you dressed up for Halloween?<eos> No. Uh...<eos> No, w-we're just a little dirty and tired.<eos> What's wrong with your face?<eos> Nothing.
No.<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to check in, make sure you're okay.<eos> You all right?<eos> This must all be really overwhelming for you, so just let me know if you need anything, okay?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Ma'am, I have something I need to show you.<eos> Can you come with me?<eos> Good luck on your interview.
- No, I don't.<eos> Look right into it.<eos> Your friends are gonna see you.<eos> Five, four, three, two...<eos> Thanks, Jonathan.<eos> We're here live with the man who we know simply as Manny...<eos> Hey!<eos> What are you doing, son?<eos> - a man who stumbled into the backyard<eos> - of a local Eastborough home...
Just a moment.<eos> Come see.<eos> Get you ass off the hammock now.<eos> I will throw you out, if this continues.<eos> Did you order from the Venus catalog again?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Don't be so mean to me.<eos> - Answer the door, someone's waiting for you.<eos> - Where?<eos> At the door, jeez!
What is... Uh...<eos> Hello.<eos> My colleague, the minesweeper.<eos> Come on, get it.<eos> Now I sign.<eos> Don't be afraid, it's just...<eos> It's really just my blood pressure monitor.<eos> My brother, that was me.<eos> Obvious, right?<eos> No offense.
We must have done something wrong.<eos> Come back inside.<eos> I'm still on the phone.<eos> And what else did he say?<eos> Almost done, dad.<eos> Yes, that's a good start.<eos> Anyway, I will get back in touch... uhm... with you tomorrow and...<eos> I'm glad we talked.<eos> Good evening to you too.<eos> Bye.
Well, you can tell them that you're my father, but maybe that you're tired after your cultural program.<eos> Go.<eos> We are late already.<eos> So again: Why Romania?<eos> Romania offers significant opportunities to American businesses With products, services or technologies, To meet with one's needs.<eos> That guy looks like Tiriac.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Can you grab us something from the buffet, please?<eos> - Something.<eos> The buffet?
Right.<eos> - Did you arrange something?<eos> - Oh yeah, everything okay.<eos> - A good evening to you.<eos> - Good evening. See you tomorrow.<eos> He's the CEO I told you about. He's a really important contact for me.<eos> I'm freaking out. These Chinese wannabe investors...<eos> - Are you coming on Monday?<eos> - Yeah, text me where.<eos> - Da Vinci, 9 pm?
He had another girl to be his daughter .. Because this one is never there. And he needs somebody to cut his toenails.<eos> Don't you dare stealing my idea.<eos> I like to make jokes.<eos> No, we're incredibly proud of her.<eos> What she does here... and stuff.<eos> Yes, you can be.<eos> We'll talk on the phone?<eos> Goodnight everybody. It's late.<eos> I am tired.<eos> - Goodnight.

But then you should have your own answers.<eos> Hello! - Yeah I know, I've been waiting for your call.<eos> No no no, you're not disturbing at all.<eos> You're already there.<eos> OK, I can be there in ..<eos> I do not know.. 15, 20 minutes ..<eos> I know, I know.<eos> It's crazy. Stay where you are.<eos> Yeah, okay, see you!<eos> - your sandwiches ..
I believe, he's hoping we'll decide for him, that we'll emphatically order it.<eos> I think he can't be an active proponent.<eos> So I'd like to present three options.<eos> A full outsourcing in all assets, essentially a radical cut.<eos> Then ours, the middle option, which, in contrast, looks realistic and almost harmless.<eos> And a minimal solution in just one pilot asset that changes practically nothing.<eos> It's difficult to change the strategy so close to a meeting.<eos> It's not good.<eos> - Where did you eat?<eos> - Da Vinci.
And when the tide gets low, it becomes an island.<eos> There's some nasty fire coral.<eos> It stings like a jellyfish.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> Still have no idea what you are saying.<eos> He says that you should come over here.<eos> The wave breaks better.<eos> Oh, I'm okay-I'm okay.<eos> I'm cool here, thank you.<eos> Careful, gringa.
Well, not everyone can be helped, Dad.<eos> You know that.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> - Don't make this about her.<eos> - What else would it be about?<eos> If you want to make this about her, then you stink in it.<eos> She was a fighter.<eos> It's just too far, too hard, Dad.<eos> You know.<eos> And for what?
I love you, bye.<eos> Anna:<eos> Meeting up with the cute guy from last night... Don't wait up for me.<eos> Yeah, girl.<eos> It's getting late, let's go in.<eos> - I'm gonna catch one last one, thanks.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Nice meeting you guys.<eos> Farewell.<eos> (Buenas noches.)
- Come on, I got you!<eos> - Help!<eos> I got you!<eos> I got you!<eos> I got you!<eos> Come on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Huh.<eos> Someone got you.<eos> 30 or 40 yards.
I feel like I'm losing my strength.<eos> I don't think I have much time.<eos> The island I'm on is going to be taken by the tide in a few minutes.<eos> I'm about 200 yards off the shore, of this beach.<eos> I never found out what it was called.<eos> So...<eos> Um.<eos> This is useless.<eos> There's a buoy, which I'm going to try to swim to.<eos> About 30 or 40 yards away.
"Rhythmic hydrobath plus neck massage."<eos> "Creamy body scrub with hand-dredged organic sea salts."<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - There he is again.<eos> Push those ice cubes in his face.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, show that fucker you mean business.<eos> Yeah?<eos> That wouldn't be a good choice.<eos> For me.
- Can I just ask you one thing?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Would you be interested in going to nice with me, maybe get away from all this for a little while?<eos> Yeah, where is nice again?<eos> In fucking France.<eos> Yeah, I don't know, uh,<eos> I still gotta get my head shots taken, and then there's this guy, Robert.<eos> Oh, the gay guy I was telling you about, he's my roommate, and when he gets back, he's gonna help me edit my album.<eos> So, sorry, baby, but...<eos> How about some extra tlc for $300?
Semper paratus, always ready.<eos> Didn't work out.<eos> Somethin' about me not keepin' my foot locker locked.<eos> So you know this place?<eos> Yeah, it was shut down since I was maybe 25.<eos> Just go to the left.<eos> - Over there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I got a key.<eos> Tomorrow, clean slate.
Why, am I under arrest?<eos> We've had some shoplifting complaints.<eos> Do you mind if I take a look inside your car?<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Well, do you have any stolen merchandise?<eos> No.<eos> Do you have any narcotics or a weapon?<eos> No, I do not.<eos> Well, what have you got to hide?<eos> Not a thing.
You're a kid who's never set foot in a police station, Naz.<eos> How would you know that or anything?<eos> I'm not saying he's a... he's a bad cop.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> He's very good.<eos> And like all good cops, he does you over just inside the rules.<eos> He's a talented oppressor... a subtle beast.<eos> - What do you got, Dennis?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - Off the record.
I don't know.<eos> What did he do?<eos> Someone was killed, and they think that... It's crazy, but they think he did it.<eos> Any homicides last night?<eos> Some Muslim freak carved up a girl in the 2-1.<eos> You're in the wrong precinct.<eos> This is the 1-2.<eos> You gotta go to the 2-1.<eos> Thank you. All right.<eos> Good luck.
Why?<eos> Five tokes over the line.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What?<eos> He's an adult.<eos> We are not leaving.<eos> Free country.<eos> On the phone, you thought I was calling to say she'd been arrested.<eos> She's been in trouble before?<eos> What kind?
Excuse me.<eos> What?<eos> He's an adult.<eos> We are not leaving.<eos> Free country.<eos> On the phone, you thought I was calling to say she'd been arrested.<eos> She's been in trouble before?<eos> What kind?<eos> Drugs, mainly.<eos> Which?
- How did that happen?<eos> He was just here, as far as I can tell, trolling.<eos> Sergeant, they're his parents.<eos> Where's the harm in letting them see their son?<eos> You want me to argue with you a little, or just leave it at that?<eos> Leave it at that.<eos> Your parents are here.<eos> You don't want to see 'em?<eos> Sit down.<eos> No contact, please.
Disposable.<eos> Yeah, I'll say.<eos> Step to your right.<eos> Next.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You are waiting arraignment.<eos> I'm here every day,<eos> So this is my place, and I like it neat.<eos> You throw up on my floor, you clean it up.<eos> Sweet dreams.
Just hang on a second.<eos> What is it, your remedy?<eos> A machete.<eos> This fucking guy over here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Prints put them in the cab.<eos> Parking ticket puts the cab at the scene.<eos> Prints, witnesses, and his own statements put him in the scene.<eos> Harry's got the blade to within half an inch, the same as the knife in his jacket pocket, bloodied.<eos> And all this without a phone call.
Not the night of.<eos> I didn't want some kid two years out of John Jay fucking up my crime scene.<eos> I'll be happy to lead throughout. May we proceed?<eos> Of course.<eos> What's he like?<eos> College kid, no record, but hey, it's murder.<eos> You don't have to have done it before to do it.<eos> What else?<eos> For what it's worth, he's Muslim.<eos> Nation of Islam or...
What else?<eos> For what it's worth, he's Muslim.<eos> Nation of Islam or...<eos> Real one.<eos> As in, from Queens. Pakistani.<eos> I wanna wait on the blood.<eos> I want a house in Montauk.<eos> Come on, Helen.<eos> You sure he did it?<eos> No question.
Ortiz, W.<eos> Khan.<eos> Hightower.<eos> Cruz.<eos> Williams.<eos> Bail set at 500.<eos> That's a 100 an 8-ball. Sound fair?<eos> Jimmy, next time, tell your client to leave his tomahawk at home.<eos> Where'd you have to go for this one?<eos> Paris.
We are not.<eos> They invaded us a hundred years ago and took away our family's power.<eos> We are an occupied country.<eos> Believe me, Father, I shall be proud to die in battle when the time comes.<eos> But this is not our fight.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> You mean you're going to pass up this wonderful opportunity?<eos> Ilyas, we're here, and the front line will be around here... 2,000 miles away in Belgium.<eos> If we get to fight at all, it will most probably be against the Turks, our cousins... why should I want to do that?<eos> For the glory.
I think we should wait to see its outcome.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> Ali Khan.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> How dare he?<eos> A hundred years ago, a Kipiani would have kissed my feet for such an opportunity.<eos> My father will laugh at me.<eos> - He didn't actually say no.<eos> - The end of the war.
Where is he?<eos> I believe he's gone to his uncle's in Persia.<eos> They have to marry.<eos> I'm sure you'll be able to find her some suitable husband.<eos> We both know that no one will marry her now.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Hashish.<eos> It's good for the pain.<eos> And for the conscience.
I couldn't.<eos> How's life in Baku?<eos> All is much the same, except... the streets are rather chaotic because our Russian governor has run away.<eos> Why would that be?<eos> The czar abdicated.<eos> What?<eos> Yes.<eos> So the Russians have all left the city.<eos> And our soldiers are back from the front, released from their oath to the czar.<eos> But what about the Nakhararyans?
( loud thudding )<eos> ( shouting )<eos> Attack!<eos> ( shouts )<eos> Fight, you cowards!<eos> ( growls )<eos> You fucking traitor.<eos> The only traitors here are the ones who shoved their knives into their Lord Commander's heart.<eos> For thousands of years the Night's Watch has held Castle Black against the wildlings.<eos> Until you.
Dragons do not do well in captivity.<eos> - How do you know this?<eos> - That's what I do.<eos> I drink and I know things.<eos> The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles.<eos> Then Daenerys's ancestors started chaining them up in pens.<eos> A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats.<eos> They must be unchained or they'll waste away.<eos> Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?<eos> - Many times.
Yara: The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.<eos> And the ironborn who held it?<eos> They died fighting to a man.<eos> What is dead may never die.<eos> What is dead may never die.<eos> But they did and our invasion died with them.<eos> Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.<eos> Then we will take more.<eos> Why?<eos> For more pinecones and rocks?
If you want to help him, leave him be.<eos> Can it be done?<eos> There are some with this power.<eos> - How?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Have you seen it done?<eos> I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it-- it shouldn't have been possible.<eos> But it was.<eos> It could be now.<eos> Not for me.

It's not a farm anymore.<eos> Just a house.<eos> I had to sell the grounds.<eos> - We're doing fine.<eos> Elias is working at the market garden.<eos> I'm doing the congregation's books, so... we're doing alright.<eos> Elias. Family and faith, are the most important things.<eos> Right.<eos> Goodnight, mom. Goodnight.<eos> - Goodnight.

Goodnight, dad.<eos> - Goodnight, children.<eos> Goodnight, father.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> Is it true?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, Magdalena has been chosen messenger for the entire region.<eos> You know what, Magdalena?<eos> You have a light in your heart, just like your mom and dad.<eos> Goodnight.

Jehova... will... save... us.<eos> Jehova will save us.<eos> Jehova's Witnesses.<eos> Lets look at children who've been reported missing in the last 10 years.<eos> I'll ask around.<eos> Do you realize how many children have vanished in the last 10 years?<eos> Two.<eos> Both times, the press ran wild.<eos> But there hasn't been a P. No Jehova's Witness.<eos> Nothing.
I ended up using a small mixture of sodiumh...<eos> Thank you.<eos> What does it say?<eos> Lautrupvang.<eos> Sounds like a location.<eos> There is a Lautrupvang in Ballerup.<eos> "There were more kids here."<eos> We don't have any children, who have gone missing.<eos> Any abuse victims?<eos> - A few unfortunately.
You've got two kids, Right?<eos> Samuel and Magdalena.<eos> Yes, they're not here.<eos> - They're not here.<eos> No they're, um...<eos> In Sweden with their aunt.<eos> Can we come inside for a moment, to...?<eos> We don't let strangers into our home.<eos> Especially not his sort.<eos> His sort...?
Lets try to lower the pitch.<eos> What do you do, when you're not on the job?<eos> You're asking me?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> You must have interests.<eos> - I have all kinds of interests.<eos> I'm going to get beer.<eos> Well, she's...<eos> She's nice, Carl.<eos> - Huh?
It's been about a week ago now. Something like that.<eos> You haven't been with anyone, since your divorce.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Its a Wednesday night.<eos> - It's Ascension Day tomorrow.<eos> What?<eos> When were Poul and Trygve taken?<eos> May 11 2008.
He's opening the door.<eos> - What door?<eos> What?<eos> - He's opened the outer door.<eos> He is not on the train.<eos> - He is not on the train.<eos> Which side, Pasgård?<eos> - He opened the outer door.<eos> Pasgård, on which side?<eos> - The right side.
We're his soldiers, one might say.<eos> The Devil's?<eos> Satan's?<eos> So that's why you're doing this?<eos> Hello.<eos> He came to me, when I needed him the most.<eos> Hello, mom.<eos> He made me strong, when I was weak.<eos> And then I was his.<eos> From that moment on.
So you kill children?<eos> To sacrifice them to him?<eos> Does he get their souls in hell?<eos> - This has nothing to do with children.<eos> I understand how it might seem like that, but it's not.<eos> I found the purest way to serve his sacred will.<eos> Enough of that.<eos> We need to beat God.<eos> I take their faith away.<eos> From the child, the parents, the family.
What for?<eos> Traction.<eos> Yeah. It's here. Great.<eos> What do we pay?<eos> Nothing till it's released.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> You can't have it now.<eos> If you'd have called, I could have told you that.<eos> Well, we have to come back to get it. When?<eos> After the trial, or never.
- Months?<eos> - Or longer.<eos> Slow wheels of justice and all.<eos> And I hate to say it, but you'll probably lose in civil court.<eos> Unless, uh... which of you is Khan?<eos> Him.<eos> - Is it your relative, sir?<eos> - What?<eos> - Is it your relative who's been charged?<eos> - Yes. My son.
Check the fridge.<eos> You check the fridge.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Chandra.<eos> That's right, isn't it? - Yes.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - Crowe and Associates. - Where you from?<eos> - Um, Baltimore.<eos> - Your parents.<eos> - Mumbai.
I will once again be presiding over my party's Midnight Purge Mass because I still believe in it.<eos> The Midnight Purge Mass, where our great NFFA leaders gather together and slaughter innocents.<eos> Is murder our new religion?<eos> Senator.<eos> Murder is our new religion.<eos> That's snappy.<eos> No, the Midnight Purge Mass where NFFA leaders gather to celebrate the night that saved this country from economic ruin.<eos> We have other ways.<eos> Now, America is built upon sacrifice.<eos> From the Revolution all the way to World War II.
It's just me and you, pal.<eos> Tell me what you want me to do.<eos> I'm there.<eos> Go downstairs, make sure they take care of the doors.<eos> - Keep an eye on that guy.<eos> - Done.<eos> The NFFA has created predatory capitalism where profit-making is the essence of democracy.<eos> We've come to D.C. to make some changes.<eos> That was Dante Bishop.<eos> Like his predecessor Carmelo Johns...
This is my slice of the pie.<eos> Man, I cannot, I can't lose this place.<eos> I can't lose this place.<eos> Hold on, Joe.<eos> Let's talk about this.<eos> Everything is in place.<eos> Team's in position.<eos> Ten minutes to lockdown, boss.<eos> Hey, Mama.<eos> You ready?
- It's a process.<eos> - I'm not fuckin' around.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Do you need to know or does your husband?<eos> You know I hate it when you call her that.<eos> Course I do.<eos> That's why I call her that.<eos> She's got a right to be angry.<eos> Her share of the gold is sitting up there, - along with mine.<eos> - And mine.
- Simone something. Italian name.<eos> - Not Simone Pozzi?<eos> - That's it.<eos> I know her.<eos> A repulsive Stalinist.<eos> When we met, your mom was handing out comie tracts.<eos> A real terror.<eos> Okay, I was a communist.<eos> 3 years. No shame.<eos> - Just 3 years...
- 5 minutes. Don't just stand there.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - Sorry, I look like a bum.<eos> - I spend all night outside.<eos> - Outside?<eos> Hello. Protesting against an eviction.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Friends were arrested.<eos> My girlfriend got hit.<eos> - Nothing serious? - Not really.
Hello. Protesting against an eviction.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Friends were arrested.<eos> My girlfriend got hit.<eos> - Nothing serious? - Not really.<eos> - Do you do this often?<eos> - Sometimes.<eos> - I got your books. They're on the table.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Bon appétit.
- Heinz.<eos> - Oh, yeah... what an awful name.<eos> How could you marry a guy with a name like that?<eos> Hello, Mrs. Lavastre. How are you today?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Go on in.<eos> - Already?<eos> - I said all I had to.<eos> - You have two hours left.<eos> - What for?
- I'm aware that people suffer.<eos> - Who is this guy?<eos> Are you acting dumb?<eos> It's Sarkozy.<eos> President of France.<eos> He's ugly.<eos> You preferred Chirac?<eos> He wasn't bad.<eos> - He made love with his boots on.<eos> - What?

What a funny cat.<eos> It's my mother's.<eos> Pandora.<eos> She can't keep her. I'm allergic.<eos> If anyone wants her, she's yours.<eos> - What are your vacation plans?<eos> - We are all going to my dad's, in Corsica.<eos> He'll be away.<eos> It'll be cool. We'll rent a car.<eos> And you?
No.<eos> We also have to say that the Essay Collection is being reviewed.<eos> But even repackaged, it seems iffy.<eos> The future seems compromised.<eos> - And the Horkheimer book?<eos> - The contract was signed.<eos> Through we do have doubts about an umpteenth text on the Frankfurt school.<eos> What's done is done.<eos> Christelle will contact you in September to finalize the layout.<eos> - Bye. - Bye.
- Bye. - Bye.<eos> Nathalie, I came by this morning for the last of my things.<eos> I did my best to respect our agreement.<eos> I think we misplaced The World as Will and Representation.<eos> If you find it, can you put it aside?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> No way! My Levinas books with all my notes.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> And Buber too?
Bob Dylan's idol.<eos> Then a button-nosed kid, as he kicked up his heel<eos> Said, my Daddy works in the iron and the steel<eos> My Daddy makes the planes so they fly through the sky<eos> That's what keeps your daddy up there so high<eos> That's what keeps your daddy up there so high<eos> That's what keeps your daddy up there so high<eos> You ain't afraid, well neither am I 'Cause my daddy keeps your daddy up there so high<eos> We listened to the same records for 20 years.<eos> Brahms and Schumann.
Denying reality won't lead to a new way of thinking.<eos> We're conforming to stereotypes.<eos> You submit to the system you denounce, ruled by the notion of the individual.<eos> - By signing, you don't submit?<eos> - No, the struggle is elsewhere.<eos> - I agree with Fabian. - Thank you.<eos> By not signing our name we don't abolish the notion of author, we draw even more attention to ourselve'.<eos> Meanwhile, when think to benefit from the prestige of the anti-author position...<eos> What do you say?<eos> About what?

I just spoke to my super. There's a leak at my place.<eos> Shit.<eos> - Sure you have to go? - Yes, unfortunately.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> - I've disappointed you.<eos> - No, no...<eos> - It's not the opposite?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> So, all's well.<eos> - Goodnight. - Goodnight.
Give me your plate.<eos> For your son.<eos> - From him.<eos> - For Leonard?<eos> - How nice.<eos> - Can I see?<eos> - You'll thank him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The Mysteries of Plato.<eos> - Not too early for philosophy?
Easy, easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> What do you remember?<eos> They stabbed me.<eos> Olly... he put a knife in my heart.<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> The lady brought you back.<eos> Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go?<eos> What did you see?<eos> Nothing.
Who we captured on patrol.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's very good.<eos> But that's a report.<eos> I was thinking more of a conversation.<eos> A wise man once said the true history of the world is the history of great conversations in elegant rooms.<eos> Who said this?<eos> Me.<eos> Just now.<eos> All right, no conversations.
Who said this?<eos> Me.<eos> Just now.<eos> All right, no conversations.<eos> Let's play a game.<eos> You don't play games, either one of you, ever?<eos> Games are for children.<eos> My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.<eos> There, that's a start.<eos> - Only the girls.
All I need in return are whispers.<eos> No need to be afraid.<eos> This is Ser Gregor.<eos> He's friends with all my friends.<eos> Run along now.<eos> Varys's little birds?<eos> Your little birds now, Your Grace.<eos> What did you do to him exactly?<eos> I haven't been able to get a clear answer.<eos> Oh, a number of things.
Not until you promise you won't cut it down.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> I'll go and get on the roof of my store right --<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Can I offer you a temporary tattoo?<eos> I'll get him down, Freddie.<eos> I know just how to play this guy.<eos> Please get down.<eos> Freddie says the budget's so tight that if you delay us just seven days, the whole thing'll be canceled, saving your stupid tree.<eos> Seven days?
Carlo!<eos> He's kidding.<eos> He's kidding.<eos> I've learned everything.<eos> - I'm virtually off score.<eos> - Good. Then let's get started.<eos> Here we are.<eos> The Bell Song.<eos> Oh. Isn't it a little early in the morning for Lakmé, Carlo?<eos> Not for a singer of your ability.
Oh?<eos> Carlton Smith from the Musical Courier has got one.<eos> So has Stubbs from World Bugle.<eos> I'm not sure it's an event that would interest the readers of the New York Post.<eos> My editor would disagree. There's quite a buzz around town about it.<eos> He sent me down here himself.<eos> So, can I get that ticket?<eos> Why not?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Voilà.

There's quite a buzz around town about it.<eos> He sent me down here himself.<eos> So, can I get that ticket?<eos> Why not?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Voilà.<eos> I just need the ticket.<eos> It's both or neither, Mr Wilson.<eos> Then I'll trouble you no more.<eos> - Good evening.

- Good evening.<eos> Yes.<eos> Darling. Augustus is here.<eos> Ah, what a surprise.<eos> - How are you, Augustus?<eos> - Couldn't be better.<eos> I hear your play was a triumph.<eos> I am a second-rate playwright and we all know that.<eos> But I'm a first-rate friend, the latter outweighing the former, I feel.<eos> With knobs on.
We'll see.<eos> I'm watching them carefully.<eos> Carlton Smith.<eos> And Mr Stubbs.<eos> We're greatly honoured.<eos> I hope you enjoy the evening.<eos> - We will, St Clair.<eos> - Fingers crossed.<eos> Tell the ushers that absolutely no one gets in without a ticket.<eos> No exceptions.
Too many?<eos> Too many feathers you think?<eos> The perfect number of feathers.<eos> Restrained and elegant.<eos> - I'm so nervous, Whitey.<eos> - Oh, don't be.<eos> - Are you nervous, Mr McMoon?<eos> - Somewhat.<eos> You have a full and very warm house and you are both going to be sensational.<eos> Ready?
- Oh, don't be.<eos> - Are you nervous, Mr McMoon?<eos> - Somewhat.<eos> You have a full and very warm house and you are both going to be sensational.<eos> Ready?<eos> Hm-hm. Yes.<eos> Break a leg.<eos> House lights, please.<eos> This is what we live for, isn't it?<eos> This moment.
Hmm?<eos> Shut your eyes. I'll recite for you.<eos> Bright star!<eos> ... ...would I... were steadfast as thou art -<eos> Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,<eos> And watching, with eternal lids apart,<eos> - Like Nature's patient, sleep...<eos> - I think I'll read.<eos> - Well, goodnight, my love.<eos> - Night-night.
- And slightly to the left.<eos> And swing as though it's through molasses.<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> You're listening to "The Firestone Hour" with me, Richard Crooks, on the NBC Radio Network.<eos> We have a caller on line one, Mrs Edna Hoffman of New Jersey.<eos> Go ahead, Edna.<eos> Mr Crooks, would you play Brahms's "Lullaby"?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> For anyone in particular?
The only question now is whether you will stand by your patron and friend in her hour of need, or whether you will focus on your ambition.<eos> Please, Cosmé.<eos> Will you play for your friend?<eos> OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, golly. Oh, golly gosh.<eos> Come on, you're gonna play at Carnegie Hall.<eos> - How many people can say that?<eos> - Oh, boy, we're gonna die out there.<eos> Hey, Tallulah, up here!
I'm adding a codicil to my will.<eos> Because I would like you to have a little something when I die, Cosmé.<eos> Thank you, Madam Florence.<eos> Mr Totten, would you mind witnessing right here?<eos> Right here.<eos> - Oh, thank you very much.<eos> - Not at all.<eos> Now will you please go on?<eos> Jenny.<eos> Ready?
- Oh, thank you, Kitty.<eos> - The phone hasn't stopped ringing.<eos> - Oh, hasn't it?<eos> Now, you are pooped, Bunny.<eos> Straight to bed or I shall be very, very cross.<eos> Oh, yes, alright.<eos> Well, Mr McMoon, we did it.<eos> We did it.<eos> - And goodnight.<eos> - Goodnight.
Utterly, utterly brilliant.<eos> - We did it.<eos> - Yes, I think we did.<eos> Mud in your eye.<eos> - Thank you, Mr Bayfield. - Hmm?<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Oh, no, don't thank me.<eos> No, I...<eos> I had the night of my life.<eos> Down in one.
I'm not playing with this dude.<eos> You know who that be?<eos> Yeah, kind of.<eos> Charm a brother, promising this, that, and the other.<eos> Next thing you know, he got your ass by the throat.<eos> With all the muscle he got in here, he don't got to do that any more than a spider need to sweet-talk a fly.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Well, someone else told me I should make a deal with him.<eos> - Who?<eos> - With him.
I'm kidding.<eos> Now, understand, everything in here is a weapon.<eos> match, toothpick, thread, ink tube from your fucking pen.<eos> Even that.<eos> Not even boiling, neither.<eos> It's hot enough to mix up your noodles, your Swiss Miss or whatever.<eos> Squirt some baby oil in it, throw that on a dude, shit is like napalm.<eos> Take your skin right off.<eos> Where do they get the baby oil?<eos> Commissary.
Oh, shit.<eos> For real, for real, huh?<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> What's up with that cell phone business, bro?<eos> I ain't got no cell phone business.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Shit, dawg.<eos> I must have heard wrong, then.<eos> Come on, Freddy. I told you, I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Not one cell phone?
I switched it off.<eos> - Huh. What the fuck?<eos> - Hey!<eos> Hey. Hey. Look here.<eos> We have 3 seeds.<eos> Right?<eos> Just three.<eos> 1.<eos> 2 and 3.<eos> 3 seeds.
We have 3 seeds.<eos> Right?<eos> Just three.<eos> 1.<eos> 2 and 3.<eos> 3 seeds.<eos> In their sit cups, oh and cute.<eos> Now the water.<eos> Now you add it.<eos> - Just 3 seeds.
2 and 3.<eos> 3 seeds.<eos> In their sit cups, oh and cute.<eos> Now the water.<eos> Now you add it.<eos> - Just 3 seeds.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Planting a tree.<eos> How big is the tree going to get?<eos> As big as the sky!
Thank you.<eos> I would also like the honey.<eos> As I see there is still no cake.<eos> One wonders why you comment on its absence, given that it is our common sacrifice for Lent.<eos> Meanwhile, Islamists have festivals of fasting, in which the frail and elderly are not deprived.<eos> I have no objection to our Asian neighbours.<eos> But when it comes to Lent, we do things our way, thank you very much.<eos> - Honey, Sister?<eos> - No!<eos> Bread and butter for me.
Well, don't sell flowers down the Hand And Shears, do they?<eos> No.<eos> And don't come near me, unless you want de-fleaing.<eos> What's gotten into you?<eos> Eh?<eos> - DOG WHIMPERS - You'll find out soon enough.<eos> I'm in labour.<eos> What, now?<eos> What do you think of the name Jonquil?<eos> - For a boy?
No.<eos> And don't come near me, unless you want de-fleaing.<eos> What's gotten into you?<eos> Eh?<eos> - DOG WHIMPERS - You'll find out soon enough.<eos> I'm in labour.<eos> What, now?<eos> What do you think of the name Jonquil?<eos> - For a boy?<eos> - For a girl!
Like daffodil, only French.<eos> Well, names are your department.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And carrying bags is yours, Bernie...<eos> Come on.<eos> It's time to go.<eos> I can smell spring in the air.<eos> My other two were winter babies.<eos> I haven't had a spring one, not till this little afterthought.<eos> Little accident, more like.
It's a case of "good luck with that", as far as I'm concerned!<eos> Sister Monica Joan, you can do these moves in a seated position.<eos> - She's such a slave driver.<eos> - No talking, please!<eos> We need to save our breath for our exercises.<eos> Just follow me!<eos> Hands to the cleavage then out horizontally.<eos> Hands to the cleavage then out horizontally.<eos> Then we add a marching step.<eos> Knees high!
Excitement is what parents want for other people's daughters.<eos> When I used to help my father on his visits, he would introduce me as Barbara, his parish assistant.<eos> Oh.<eos> Black mark, Mr Gilbert, in my book.<eos> It's quite all right.<eos> It's just his way.<eos> Though I suppose when I was younger, I did wish he might say,<eos> "This is Barbara, my daughter."<eos> So, "Weather mixed, work splendid, social injustice is still rife.<eos> "No accidents, injuries or boyfriends."
It was magical.<eos> Do you have a motor car?<eos> I couldn't justify it.<eos> It is an expense, but it's freedom, Tommy.<eos> The Great North Road, a picnic and a fine day.<eos> It rivals anything the Mediterranean can offer.<eos> I'll hold you to that. The next fine day.<eos> You had a drink?<eos> Just with the lads.<eos> Good for you.

Mrs Beckett.<eos> Oh, good God.<eos> Someone fetch one of the Sisters!<eos> I don't understand how he's losing weight, I'm doing all I can.<eos> It's perfectly normal for a little while after birth -- he'll soon start putting it back on.<eos> Connie, is it still difficult for you, feeding?<eos> I just got to keep going with it, is all.<eos> Like Sister Evangelina says, it gets easier.<eos> It does.<eos> But not always for everyone.
You GRAB them.<eos> With both hands.<eos> I'd adore to.<eos> I thoroughly enjoy my class but it feels a little like Grandmother Hen has landed in a nest of chicks.<eos> Well, I hope those chicks know that Grandmother has two deadly midwives on her side.<eos> "Put 'em up.<eos> Put 'em up."<eos> You're very kind, but there's no need.<eos> I did wonder -- might it be possible for you to... .."polish" me a little?<eos> Just a touch of powder, something around the eyes, perhaps. Nothing dramatic.
You promised me you'd get me through.<eos> Well, now I'm asking -- will you stand by your word?<eos> I will.<eos> I will stand by my word.<eos> I want to ask permission to go away.<eos> For six months at least.<eos> To the Mother House?<eos> No.<eos> I want to spend time with an enclosed order.<eos> The Sisters of the Blessed Infant Christ.
I hope I'm wrong, but the only time I've seen those pink spots... that plucking movement on the sheets was with my mother and sister in the prison camp. - Typhoid.<eos> We say nothing until we know for sure.<eos> No sense in spreading panic.<eos> But we should be ready.<eos> It's Dorothy.<eos> I'm sorry to call you at home, but I need...<eos> 'I'm sorry, madam, I think you have the wrong number.'<eos> Jeremy, I know you can't talk, but listen...<eos> - 'Quite all right.<eos> Goodbye.'
Miss Lewis will mind your class.<eos> Mr Roberts?<eos> It's Sister Mary Cynthia.<eos> District Nurse.<eos> Stan? !<eos> They won't even let me see her.<eos> I'm afraid when something is this infectious, patients are kept in isolation.<eos> I mean, typhoid!<eos> I thought that went out with the Ark!<eos> Or at least the war.
I'm Nurse Mount, I'm Mrs Su's midwife.<eos> How is she?<eos> We've managed to re-hydrate her, but it'll take another 24 hours for the Chloramphenicol to take effect.<eos> Really, it all depends on whether we can get her through that.<eos> What does one wear to an Indian restaurant?<eos> Well, I don't expect you have to wear a sari or anything.<eos> Just wear what you'd wear to any other meal out.<eos> Well, I don't have a lot of experience of meals out.<eos> With a man.<eos> Not any, actually.
Jeanette don't care about her being a carrier.<eos> She just wants her Nana Meg back.<eos> We all do.<eos> I don't think I'll ever have to eat again!<eos> Fred was right about the milk, though!<eos> I don't feel like there's steam coming out of my ears any more.<eos> Thank you, Tom.<eos> I had the most splendid time.<eos> So did I.<eos> Goodnight.
Postman'll be here soon.<eos> He might walk past again, like he did yesterday and the day before.<eos> Nurse calling!<eos> Come through, angel.<eos> Angel?<eos> I could get used to that.<eos> - Hello, Nurse.<eos> - Hello!<eos> Still, I suppose there is something rather celestial about a person who comes bearing burns dressings - and a quarter of medicinal confectionery.<eos> - From Linda?
And unbearable.<eos> I'm not sure if I did enough.<eos> Sister Monica Joan, do you suppose that it's ever acceptable to tell a lie?<eos> I think the question is not if it's acceptable, but if it is kind.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I do know that telling the truth would be cruel.<eos> So cruel.<eos> Then there can be no virtue in it.<eos> No.<eos> Corned beef, and a bit of Pan Yan pickle.
Once upon a time, one of us would have leaned forward to kiss the other one just then.<eos> I know.<eos> But neither of us did.<eos> No.<eos> When you look at Barbara, do you want to lean forward and kiss her?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> I have done, once or twice.<eos> - Oh. - But don't worry. It won't happen again.<eos> If we were ever going out at all, Barbara ended it.<eos> Because of you.
Hot off the press.<eos> Is that the health report?<eos> I feel a drum roll is in order.<eos> Well, shall we see how we've fared?<eos> I thought it might at least be the new James Bond novel.<eos> Far more exciting. Patrick Turner, GP, licensed to practice medicine. And secret agent Shelagh Turnova, save Poplar from ill health and disease!<eos> That's it, ladies.<eos> If we want to reduce, we must keep moving.<eos> And make sure you all have enough room.<eos> No injuries tonight, please.
Hello, ladies.<eos> Yes, your eyes do not deceive you.<eos> It is I, Fred Buckle of the Buckle establishment.<eos> And Mrs Buckle?<eos> Attending to other business.<eos> Now, how may I be of service?<eos> I've a fitting.<eos> Smashing.<eos> Remind me of what kind of fitting?<eos> Brassiere... Oh.
It's worth it though.<eos> One day, you'll be standing in this shop, proud as I am today.<eos> You'll look at your little girl and you'll see yourself.<eos> You'll show her the way, Mrs Dawley.<eos> How is baby, Mrs Dawley?<eos> She's perfect, Miss.<eos> Well, she'll look it in this.<eos> Now, home, please, Mrs Dawley.<eos> Your husband has settled already.<eos> Well, bye-bye.
- Lizzie...<eos> - I have to.<eos> I have to get back to my kids.<eos> How awful.<eos> And we were only waiting up to see if you'd help Delia with her bust-darts.<eos> It's all hands on deck once I start tangling with bodices!<eos> I'm a terrible seamstress.<eos> There was nowhere she could turn to.<eos> No-one who would help her.<eos> - Apart from you.
- Night.<eos> Evidence would suggest that this man attacked two women on two nights back-to-back.<eos> One was set upon here.<eos> The exact location of the second attack is unclear.<eos> We will be patrolling in pairs from 9pm until dawn.<eos> - Dawn?<eos> You'd think there was a war on! - LAUGHTER<eos> There is no cause for levity.<eos> Ladies' safety is at risk.<eos> - What ladies? - MORE LAUGHTER
I'm sure you'd rather talk to a doctor.<eos> The name's Godfrey.<eos> I've just delivered a baby, and the afterbirth hasn't come away.<eos> - And what is the patient's name?<eos> - Hills.<eos> It's been more than an hour-and-a-half!<eos> The placenta can take its time, but I expect you know that from your training.<eos> Employ Brandt Andrews, and, er, don't forget, good pull on the cord.<eos> - Thank you, Doctor.<eos> - Best of British!
He went for defenceless women who were going about their ordinary business.<eos> It's prison work.<eos> Soot or ink rubbed into cuts made with a knife.<eos> I don't know that one.<eos> This one says he's a convicted brigand.<eos> This one says what he thinks of his sentence.<eos> I've had more old lags than you can shake a stick at come through these doors, and I've never seen tats like that.<eos> I have.<eos> You get them on the Soviet lads, the ones that come in with the Merchant Marine.<eos> - Soviet?
Excellent!<eos> Oh! Very good.<eos> - There we are.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You haven't gained anything in a month, Gina.<eos> Top of the milk for you, and make sure you help yourself to an extra potato.<eos> That being said, I'm not sure how much longer you've got left.<eos> There's still nothing doing, Nurse.<eos> I thought, if I came down here, it might stop me painting the bathroom.<eos> Or me husband.
Gina, I'm sure that isn't true.<eos> We'd only been courting three months and we had to get married.<eos> It's not what either of us planned.<eos> - I couldn't help it, once I felt him kicking... .. but I don't think Leslie ever did.<eos> He's so soft.<eos> Leslie said we could call him Robert, if he was a boy, after his grandad.<eos> But I just don't think he really wanted him... or me.<eos> Except for in the way he shouldn't have.<eos> It's far too late to be crying about that now.<eos> - Barley sugar?
"and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest<eos> "and will bring thee again into this land..."<eos> ".. for I will not leave."<eos> The Book of Genesis instead of Keats, indeed.<eos> That gale must have blown some sense into you.<eos> (Go and see if there's any cake in the tin.)<eos> 'For some, the high winds altered very little.<eos> 'The Blackers, with their healthy newborn, 'left London and headed North along straight waterways 'that hadn't changed in decades.'<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Aw, bye!
See you!<eos> Bye!<eos> Get ready for the rough weather again:<eos> cold, snow and big waves.<eos> - Amaya, the weather is already changing.<eos> - Yes, it's cold and this morning...<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi, love.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Fine, and you?
A hundred large per case.<eos> Ten cases, a cool mil.<eos> Wholesale.<eos> Brand spanking new.<eos> No serial numbers... because my connect is nice like that.<eos> [Domingo] Who's your connect?<eos> [Stokes] He's real and his inventory runs deep.<eos> - So that's it.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Easy-peasy.
[laughing] [bones crunching] [screaming]<eos> [Zip grunting]<eos> - [gunshot] - [Luke grunts]<eos> [bullet clattering]<eos> You want some?<eos> I don't even like these niggas, man.<eos> I'm sorry about your window.<eos> [cash register opening]<eos> Here.<eos> - For what?
They have his half of the money.<eos> Now they want yours.<eos> -Shameek is dead?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Well, good. [spits]<eos> Then you just want my money for yourself, don't you?<eos> I couldn't care less.<eos> I came here because Pop asked me to come for you.<eos> Pops?<eos> For your dad.
Turned into a bloodbath.<eos> Dante Chapman was found dead at the scene.<eos> Shameek Smith was found about 18 hours later, beaten to death.<eos> Last person to see Shameek Smith alive, other than a strip club... was right here at the shop with his homeboy.<eos> Uh, they were both here.<eos> Chico gave Shameek a fade in that chair, right next to where you're standing.<eos> That's it though.<eos> That's the last time I saw them both.<eos> You really think Chico killed his friend?<eos> Over money?
I said I'm good.<eos> How long have you been working here at the shop?<eos> Five months.<eos> Did Chico reach out to Pop since we were in here earlier?<eos> Was he hiding out here the whole time?<eos> -What did they get from the canvass?<eos> -[Scarfe] Uh, patrol got nothing.<eos> Traffic cam picked up a black Escalade.<eos> Tracked it to Hunts Point in the Bronx, but it was torched.<eos> No prints.
No prints.<eos> [inhales sharply] They were after Chico?<eos> -There's no doubt in my mind.<eos> -Hmm.<eos> I checked out Cottonmouth.<eos> He's been at the club all night in VIP.<eos> -So we don't have shit?<eos> -No.<eos> No decent witnesses except for Chico, but then what else?<eos> Nothin'?
Not yet.<eos> -[breathing deeply] -[man] What are you doing here, nigga?<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> Young man...<eos> I've had a long day.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> But I'm not tired enough... to ever let nobody call me that word.<eos> You see a nigga standin' in front of you?<eos> Across the street from a building named after one of our greatest heroes?<eos> -[gun cocks] -Yeah, a dead one.
-Until what?<eos> -Until Luke Cage started workin' there.<eos> You got a real problem with this guy.<eos> Well, maybe, you shouldn't have jumped in the sack with him so quickly.<eos> -[scoffs] -[chuckles]<eos> How soon did it happen?<eos> A couple days after you were undercover at the Harlem's Paradise?<eos> Same night.<eos> [chuckles] Damn, girl!<eos> [chuckles] His place or yours?
Allegedly.<eos> Thing I can't figure out... why would somebody... go through all this hell outside, cause all this mayhem, and then leave the money behind?<eos> [sighs] To take it off the streets.<eos> Once it's logged, whoever it belongs to doesn't have access to it anymore.<eos> That's quite a message someone's trying to send.<eos> All that gunfire and no bodies.<eos> Oh, you got that right.<eos> They are nobodies. [sighing]<eos> I mean, no bodies.<eos> Not one.
I think that's wonderful.<eos> I think we should thank him.<eos> -For doing our job?<eos> -Exactly.<eos> I don't like paperwork... but I'd rather get a paper cut on my finger than a bullet in my ass.<eos> Look at...<eos> Look at all them rounds.<eos> Look.<eos> You really wanna be in the middle of all this?<eos> And for what?
Time for me to go holler at the dishwasher.<eos> Personally.<eos> Don't want to know the details.<eos> Just get it done.<eos> [music playing faintly]<eos> Goddamn, negro.<eos> You all right?<eos> What happened to you?<eos> You get hit by a bus?<eos> Swear jar.
Don't want to know the details.<eos> Just get it done.<eos> [music playing faintly]<eos> Goddamn, negro.<eos> You all right?<eos> What happened to you?<eos> You get hit by a bus?<eos> Swear jar.<eos> You cursed.<eos> Swear jar?
Any survivors?<eos> Inside, your guess is as good as ours.<eos> We're lucky only the restaurant and the apartments above collapsed, and not the whole structure.<eos> This could've been a hell of a lot worse.<eos> - Who's this guy?<eos> - [firefighter] Chinese guy's the owner.<eos> Says his wife and their tenant were in the restaurant when it happened.<eos> Can you, uh...<eos> give me a call if anything changes?<eos> - No problem.
- On you?<eos> - On me!<eos> You mean to tell me this ain't hot?<eos> Says it right here, on the cover.<eos> "The Hot Issue."<eos> Come out of the time machine, Squabs.<eos> There's a lot of new honeys out there.<eos> You don't know nothing about Beyoncé?<eos> Nicki Minaj?<eos> - Lisa Bonet's daughter?
Yeah, yeah, unless you were set up.<eos> I know I was set up.<eos> - [chuckling] - [inmate] Me, too.<eos> - [inmates agreeing indistinctly] - Even if you were set up... you have to see your involvement in what went down.<eos> You ever say that to yourself?<eos> You ask these men to come clean with themselves, and they don't know a thing about you.<eos> What gives you the right to listen to us, but not share anything about yourself?<eos> That's not my role.<eos> - Trust has to be earned.<eos> - True.
This ain't shit.<eos> - Wait for it. - [whirring]<eos> - Wait for it. - [muffled explosion]<eos> That is the illest shit I've ever seen in my life!<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Based on a prototype by Hammer.<eos> The rounds are a composite, invisible to metal detectors.<eos> And they incinerate forensic evidence, so they are untraceable.<eos> What kind of metal does that?<eos> Nothing from this Earth.
Your new VH1 show?<eos> Criminal Spinsters?<eos> Who you callin' a spinster?<eos> I'd wear your narrow ass out.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Your cousin.<eos> I'm shutting him down.<eos> You, too.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> Never that.
The whole point of livin' in New York, no one cares about anybody.<eos> A building fell on you. People are shooting at you. And you walk around without a scratch.<eos> Who's gonna ignore all that?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It's supposed to be locked.<eos> Bobby?<eos> Are you in here, man?<eos> - Scarfe?<eos> - No cops.<eos> - Not even Misty.
Look, look, look, Scarfe's not comin'.<eos> He's not gonna show up just to get arrested.<eos> Look at these two.<eos> - I think she's about to...<eos> - She's gonna knock him out.<eos> Maybe you should go arrest them.<eos> I don't know if you remember me ten years ago, when I first got bumped up off patrol?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It didn't seem like you belonged.<eos> No offense.
You... you really, uh, have no right to show that one.<eos> Well, how about this one?<eos> A somehow brutal assault that took place at the Crispus Attucks Houses didn't make the news.<eos> Even stranger was the millions of dollars in cash found on the premises in your office.<eos> There's some people on the scene even describe a man who, under a barrage of gunfire, managed to beat down a number of criminals, some of whom may have worked for your family.<eos> So you can see how it might be difficult to decipher which Harlem you stand for.<eos> Despite these unwarranted attacks on my character, I have always tried to make clear what I want... which I can't say for you, Thembi.<eos> It's very clear what you and the rest of your media friends want.<eos> You want a story.<eos> Not the news.

And how do I do that with Luke Cage around?<eos> All he has to do is show up and hoods scatter like roaches with the lights on!<eos> Guns, drugs, all street traffic is a mess right now because of him!<eos> Niggas act like he can walk on water.<eos> Can he?<eos> I'm done talking, Shades.<eos> Tell Diamondback I need to holler at him.<eos> You sure that's the way you want to play this?<eos> Okay.<eos> So what about all that evidence?
Parley's just fine.<eos> Your gangster shit hasn't worked out so well for you recently.<eos> Harlem's Paradise.<eos> Bring your apron.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> Enough.<eos> Might as well take all that down now.<eos> No.<eos> There's still plenty of work to be done.<eos> Not for me.
Family first, Robin.<eos> I love my cousin Cornell Stokes.<eos> The charges against him are categorically false, which is why they let him go.<eos> He is an integral part of my New Harlem Renaissance and our movement to rebuild Harlem for our Harlemites.<eos> Okay?<eos> That's it.<eos> Get out of the rain.<eos> Go, go!<eos> Ah! This is low...<eos> even for you.
It's not working now.<eos> Find a new hobby.<eos> You can't stay on top forever, Mariah.<eos> You're gonna fall. And I'll enjoy every second when you do.<eos> You need to leave now.<eos> Show your Marigny ass out.<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Scotch.<eos> Neat.<eos> Mariah?
Juilliard.<eos> There's only one school that matters.<eos> - Cornell is really good. - Mmm.<eos> Did I ask you anything, Little May?<eos> The girl's got a point.<eos> - She don't need you to defend her.<eos> - I know she don't.<eos> Because she's gonna be a lawyer, and she's gonna be able to defend her damn self.<eos> Ain't that right, baby?<eos> - Hey, Mariah.
You.<eos> She put you in school and forced me to run the streets.<eos> You idiot.<eos> She sent me away to keep me away from Pete!<eos> You know damn well what that woman made me do.<eos> I was 14 years old.<eos> Uncle Pete betrayed us.<eos> Uncle Pete was the only one who ever had my back.<eos> Mama Mabel was always sheltering you, protecting you.<eos> And for what?
Deep down... I think you did.<eos> First time... is always the hardest.<eos> Do you think... they have rubber gloves in the kitchen?<eos> Next to the dishwashing station.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Look what Luke Cage did to your cousin.<eos> Nice sweatshirt.<eos> You box now?<eos> What I do is more like CrossFit.<eos> Always full of surprises.
- I don't want Harlem.<eos> - Then what do you want?<eos> To be left alone.<eos> If that's what you truly want... then you will give me all the information you have right now.<eos> On the record.<eos> Tell me everything you have and end it.<eos> Right here.<eos> I'm not going to do that, Misty.<eos> - Then that makes you an accessory.<eos> - To what?
What?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Okay, so I'm just trying to picture it in my head.<eos> Was it mustard yellow?<eos> Or canary yellow?<eos> It was all I could grab.<eos> I couldn't go running around Georgia looking like a runaway slave.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What did your father say when he saw you?<eos> Nothing.
- Where am I?<eos> - Uh, you're in an ambulance.<eos> You went into shock.<eos> I called my friend Manny.<eos> He used to run with my uncle back in the day.<eos> He's driving.<eos> He's discreet.<eos> [groans] What the hell did you do that for?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - No hospitals.
I can't lose it.<eos> [Claire] Okay.<eos> [groans]<eos> [Claire] I'm going to sterilize the area.<eos> [wincing]<eos> - You feel that?<eos> - [groans] A bit.<eos> Keep going. No.<eos> I'm gonna see what kind of anesthetic they have here first.<eos> - No drugs. - Luke...
[Stryker] Work what out?<eos> My life?<eos> My mother destroying herself?<eos> Being away for so long?<eos> Nah.<eos> There's nothing left to work out.<eos> "I did not come to bring peace... but a sword."<eos> Ain't that what the great Reverend James Lucas used to scream at us?<eos> Preached peace and prosperity... every Sunday on the pulpit, but come Friday night on the sideline?<eos> Nothing but fire and brimstone.
I've shed my skin for something better.<eos> Stronger.<eos> You left me to rot, Carl... in a gutter.<eos> But I changed that sewer into a garden.<eos> I wasn't a good friend.<eos> I should've stood tall... but I didn't.<eos> And you paid the price.<eos> I've been watching you.<eos> Harlem doesn't realize they're worshiping a false idol.<eos> - False idol?
That's accessory to murder.<eos> That's hard time.<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> I did nothing wrong.<eos> That son of a bitch is out there hurting people.<eos> But you won't do anything to bring Luke Cage in and end this.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> Sit your ass down!<eos> Now, people have been walking out on me all day.<eos> No more lies and no more deception.
I left to become a psychologist.<eos> [scoffs]<eos> I'm with the peer assistance program. I'm a volunteer.<eos> Well, how about I volunteer my way out of this chair, tell you to kiss my ass, and talk to my union rep?<eos> Well, you could do that, sure.<eos> But your inspector would guarantee that you'll be at your desk, and the only time you'll see the street is in the parking lot, or if you go to get coffee, or...<eos> look out the window.<eos> - This is voluntary, right?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - And off the record?
Tighten up over here.<eos> Tighten up over here, all right?<eos> Let's do this, man.<eos> We rehearsed it.<eos> Let's get this done.<eos> [playing RB song]<eos> [singing]<eos> [Shades] So we've checked every truck, every landfill in every borough.<eos> And for all of that, we've got... [sighs]<eos> Nothing yet.

- [Luke groaning] - [Claire] Easy, easy.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Okay.<eos> [Luke sighs]<eos> You've got no scars.<eos> Nothing.
That all ended when they thought you were dead.<eos> - [all groaning] - [Burstein] I started again from scratch, but never came close to replicating the Seagate incident.<eos> [stammers] I'm a nurse.<eos> I know the drill.<eos> I can help.<eos> [Luke groans]<eos> Why me?<eos> Why did you pick me?<eos> Because you were strong.<eos> Stronger than most.
Where do you have it?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Let's get him out.<eos> He has chills.<eos> That won't help him.<eos> His temperature's dropping quickly.<eos> That's it.<eos> It's not the pH mixture that's the problem. It's the temperature.<eos> We need to turn it up.<eos> All the way up!
Always.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> No one has.<eos> A man whose cells can regenerate is a man who doesn't age.<eos> Do you know how valuable that is?<eos> Luke's the only one?<eos> Yes.<eos> All the other subjects failed.<eos> There's a lot of work to be done.<eos> A lot of good work.
- This is all about Luke Cage.<eos> - Look, I want Cage as badly as you do.<eos> He's at the center of three active investigations.<eos> But we need to be careful about how we pursue this.<eos> Caution is in the wind, just like he is.<eos> - Our guys need results.<eos> - Remember who you serve.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> - I know one kid who knows Luke Cage.<eos> - Who?
Caution is in the wind, just like he is.<eos> - Our guys need results.<eos> - Remember who you serve.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> - I know one kid who knows Luke Cage.<eos> - Who?<eos> What's his name?<eos> Do not light up Harlem behind this.<eos> The good people in Harlem have no problem with me.<eos> Just the assholes.
What's his name?<eos> Do not light up Harlem behind this.<eos> The good people in Harlem have no problem with me.<eos> Just the assholes.<eos> You need to be responsible.<eos> - Methodical.<eos> - That, we are.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do it right.<eos> No bullshit, no headlines.
She's a lawyer.<eos> Or she about to be.<eos> Well, if you haven't done anything wrong, you don't have any problem.<eos> I don't.<eos> But you've got about five problems, far as I can tell.<eos> Like what?<eos> I was on my way home from school.<eos> Y'all picked me up with no PC.<eos> I just got back from school.<eos> Chess club.
I was on my way home from school.<eos> Y'all picked me up with no PC.<eos> I just got back from school.<eos> Chess club.<eos> Fifteen people can place me there.<eos> And all I have in my bag is a half-eaten Snickers bar.<eos> - I want my phone call.<eos> - Sure.<eos> After you answer some questions.<eos> About what?
It's like replacing a burnt-out Christmas bulb.<eos> You repair the circuit, the whole thing lights up again.<eos> It's miraculous.<eos> It's no miracle.<eos> Wouldn't you say so?<eos> Miracles are good things.<eos> What's good about me being here, huh?<eos> All those prisoners who died.<eos> Reva's murder.<eos> For what?
He's actually beginning to hurt people.<eos> Physically, by far, he's the best subject we've had.<eos> But it remains to be seen if he'll be cleared for stage three.<eos> Every single subject has died approaching that stage.<eos> If anyone can do it, he can.<eos> You weren't supposed to see that.<eos> - So what you got?<eos> - They all said the same thing.<eos> Hoodie, Cage, and they saw Jackie go flying.<eos> No other leads?
You're never gonna do this to anyone else ever again.<eos> How's that for stakes?<eos> Claire.<eos> Claire, you're brilliant.<eos> You're not even trained. Imagine the things I could teach you.<eos> Talk to Luke.<eos> Tell him what he's throwing away.<eos> He's my friend.<eos> And that's why you'll never see him again.<eos> Or this.
This is Damon Boone.<eos> I've been instructed to tell you to stay away.<eos> Luke Cage has taken us hostage and he warns that he'll start killing people if the police approach.<eos> What does he want?<eos> He--<eos> Unpredictability gives us leverage.<eos> [Damon] All you're doing is scaring them.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Reciprocity.
I feel like getting my Crispus Attucks on up there.<eos> Mmm, you gotta be smart about this.<eos> There are too many innocent people up there who could end up dead.<eos> I might not have a choice.<eos> I had a choice.<eos> I should have trusted you.<eos> I know.<eos> [chuckles] [scoffs] You didn't make it easy.<eos> Don't go doing anything stupid.<eos> Like what?
-Please.<eos> There's no way they'll agree to that.<eos> -I know.<eos> -Hmm.<eos> [Stryker] What happened?<eos> -Lopes got pushed down the stairs.<eos> -What?<eos> One of the hostages passed out, and another one went to go get her medication.<eos> -Which hostage?<eos> -The waitress from VIP.
[sighs]<eos> They used that waitress, Candace, to frame you.<eos> [Misty scoffs] Lyin' ass.<eos> Where is she?<eos> [Claire] Upstairs with the others.<eos> Hey.<eos> What if he has more of those special bullets?<eos> That's a chance I'll have to take.<eos> If I don't walk away from this, you need to lay in the cut until you hear from me, Bobby Fish or Misty.<eos> No one else.
-No, he's going to be bailed out.<eos> The hell for?<eos> That don't make no sense! See?<eos> The questioning.<eos> That's how it starts.<eos> [sighs]<eos> I'm gonna have an opening.<eos> You gonna step up?<eos> I'm down to do whatever you need.<eos> -No problem.
She loved it.<eos> From the murals... the glasswork, all the way down to the table linens.<eos> No fine point was overlooked.<eos> -[glass shattering] -This was her legacy.<eos> My family's in tatters, and it's all because of Diamondback. Shit!<eos> [stammers]<eos> Uh, I know, I know... [sighs] I need to get out in front of this.<eos> Release a statement about Damon Boone and how much I respected him.<eos> That is not what I was gonna say.<eos> Well, yeah, just-- Please, no lectures.
Oh, snap, you Luke- [gun firing] -[bullet ricocheting]<eos> I ain't mean that.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> The phone, fool.<eos> Yo, my bad, man. You know, I just got a little nervous and shit -when you threw my mans across the-- -[grunts]<eos> It's you.<eos> -Yeah, it's you. -[chuckles]<eos> No, man, it's you.<eos> Yo, man, "P.L.O. Style" was my joint back in the day.<eos> Sweet Christmas. [chuckles]
For real, for real.<eos> You know, there's somethin' powerful about seeing a black man that's bulletproof and unafraid.<eos> -Come on, y'all. You know?<eos> -Yeah, yeah.<eos> [Method Man] Streets got mad love for Cage.<eos> I got mad love for Cage, man, and... and he one of ours.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> But you know what?<eos> We got mad love for you, too.<eos> -No doubt.
That's deep.<eos> If we find out you've been hiding him, there'll be hell to pay.<eos> Yeah, well, just don't break the hinges on that door on your way out.<eos> I just got it fixed.<eos> [smooth jazz continues on radio]<eos> That was a close shave.<eos> Bad pun.<eos> What the hell did you even come back for, man?<eos> [sighs] I had to.<eos> For Harlem.
I'm gonna recommend the New York City DA's office drop all charges against you.<eos> I have done all I can.<eos> Thank you for all you've done for us.<eos> Luke is innocent.<eos> They're not arresting Luke Cage.<eos> They're arresting Carl Lucas.<eos> Who called you?<eos> Once a city councilwoman identified Luke Cage as Carl Lucas on television, our office received numerous calls.<eos> The information's pertinent and valid.<eos> Mariah, again.
- I'm married.<eos> So, it's his wife.<eos> - Yeah. - Eh! He's a player.<eos> Aren't you, Finch? Huh?<eos> - Chick in every port? - Nah.<eos> - You okay? - Yeah, fine.<eos> You want a coffee?<eos> Yeah, can I get a skim-milk latte?<eos> - You on a diet?<eos> - A bit, yeah.
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.<eos> Go ahead, punk, make my day.<eos> - Will there be any celebrities?<eos> - The girl who reads the weather<eos> - knows Al Roker. - Will he be here?<eos> No. She might, though.<eos> Hey, Sacha.<eos> This is my wife, Eleanor.<eos> - Oh, finally. Hi. - Hi.<eos> - Many in? - Uh, no.
Let me ask you two questions.<eos> First question:<eos> - Was that from your boyfriend?<eos> - I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> - Second question: You live near here?<eos> - About five minutes.<eos> Wanna go there now?<eos> Why did you ask how far it was before you invited yourself back?<eos> If it had been a bit further away, would that have been a deal breaker?<eos> Like, five minutes, "Yeah, sure."
But they are only every four years, so, not bad.<eos> - Where did you go? Beijing?<eos> - I didn't get to Beijing, no.<eos> - No, you did those from here, too, right?<eos> - Yes. Yeah.<eos> - So, have you actually been anywhere? - Yeah.<eos> - England.<eos> - No, you're from England.<eos> - That doesn't count. - Yeah. Okay.<eos> - Here, then. - Anywhere other than here.
♪ America, hear my plea ♪<eos> ♪ And although it's only one We're sending George Washington ♪ ♪ And he's gonna bring My baby home to me ♪<eos> That was amazing.<eos> Very special. It was just so moving.<eos> Thank you, and I'd also like to appeal to the generosity of the American public.<eos> Okay, please do.<eos> Um, if each of you just give a dollar for our heroes, our hostages. I'm launching a campaign to raise money...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - I'm sending her a dollar. - What for?<eos> - For the heroes.
- Sure. - Okay.<eos> No. You sniff it.<eos> - What the fuck are you doing? - You want some?<eos> - No, we're going. - We're not going.<eos> - We're going! - We're not going.<eos> Listen to me. My wife left me, okay? Presumably for someone better.<eos> Just having a bit of fun, to remind me that life's worth living. Give me that, please.<eos> What the hell.<eos> Funny, isn't it?<eos> - Hello. - Gentlemen.
They've shrunk.<eos> It's like a little snail going into its shell. Dense.<eos> Oh, my God. I feel like I'm gonna burst.<eos> If you feel bad, it makes it bad.<eos> You feel good, and if bad, it's the, um... Uh... Oh, God.<eos> - You gonna be all right? - Yeah.<eos> Better not, because they're... Fucking, like, "Hey, man." Fuck you. You're nothing but a bitch.<eos> I've got terrible gut rot. Motorhead, "Ace of Spades." That's what I call myself on Rebel Coup.<eos> So, you have no one that loves you that is willing to pay money to get you back.<eos> Completely useless to us. Worthless.
Isn't it?<eos> I'm just gonna uh... walk past...<eos> ...these people, who would probably give us a lift.<eos> But we seem to be walking to Manhattan.<eos> - I have coffee, so...<eos> - You didn't want milk, did you?<eos> - I did, but... - Okay, good. Well, we...<eos> We're probably not allowed to go across there.<eos> This is like the end of a movie.<eos> A low-budget movie, maybe.
I know she took Tommy.<eos> My brother and I need to be in Odessa.<eos> Whatever you have to do, whatever it takes, I'm gonna be right there with you, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So what's our time frame? How long before this thing hits?<eos> - Two days.<eos> - Oh, two days, plenty of time.<eos> Okay, Tommy's been taken to Midian, Colorado, which means that's our first stop, and then we get you two to Odessa.<eos> What? Piece of cake.
We'll have to surprise them.<eos> Maybe we could take the girl alive, bring her back to Renautas.<eos> She could be super valuable alive.<eos> Erica made her wishes clear as crystal:<eos> Terminate with extreme prejudice.<eos> I'm not really clear on how you can terminate someone with mild prejudice, but I guess that's not the point.<eos> Then what is the point, Quentin?<eos> She's not that much younger than you.<eos> This doesn't bother you at all?<eos> Not even a little.
He is why Ren and I came to America. - Ren?<eos> - My partner.<eos> My only friend.<eos> My father said you'll send me on my final mission. This must be it.<eos> It's called Sunstone Manor.<eos> I'm dying.<eos> You have to send me there, so I can play my part.<eos> How am I going to convince Erica that I got rid of you?<eos> - Okay.<eos> You ready?
Was it true?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Let's just get this over with.<eos> Greetings, Tommy.<eos> Please place your other had in the connection harnes.<eos> Power core active.<eos> Quantum sync engaged.<eos> Advanced Team D, prepare for transfer.<eos> Power conversion 12 K.<eos> 15 K.

_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> It's time.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> When I was, like, seven, these people took me to this place because of my power.<eos> I remember a room filled with toys and stuff.<eos> No windows.
I presume you are talking about the large bed of colored roses that when seen from above is in the shape of our national flag?<eos> Is it still there?<eos> Seems the Germans have still not looked at it from above.<eos> I am Vanek.<eos> Ladislav Vanek.<eos> This is Uncle Hajsky.<eos> We are the head of the Jindra Organization. Czech resistance.<eos> I am Jan Kubiš.<eos> I am Josef Gabčík.<eos> From Slovakia.
We'll keep that in mind.<eos> So, what do you do when you aren't helping out here?<eos> You don't have a boyfriend?<eos> No.<eos> How's life in occupied Prague, Marie?<eos> I guess, not being registered with the police as residents has something to do with this question?<eos> I hate the Germans.<eos> And tell me, do you have a friend as lovely as you that...<eos> That you can trust?<eos> Why?
You'll be tortured until you reveal everything you know, and then you will be executed.<eos> You must protect your fellow comrades by shutting down any links you have to them.<eos> Operation Out Distance has re-supplied us with these.<eos> Carry the cyanide capsules at all times.<eos> We have to end our meeting.<eos> Use the window.<eos> Clear.<eos> Looks like there's a whole garrison there.<eos> That's our man.<eos> Five minutes after 9:00.
Use the window.<eos> Clear.<eos> Looks like there's a whole garrison there.<eos> That's our man.<eos> Five minutes after 9:00.<eos> He's riding solo today.<eos> Wait.<eos> Armed escort. Thirty seconds behind.<eos> Thirty seconds.<eos> Thirty seconds, 30 seconds.
The way things used to be.<eos> Marie makes me feel that there is hope.<eos> I love her.<eos> I do. I love her.<eos> I had the idea to transfer the 73 into a water canteen for better mobility.<eos> Rigged for impact detonation.<eos> Don't drop them, eh?<eos> That was the empty one.<eos> No, not funny, Jan.<eos> Not funny.
- Jan!<eos> Stop. Stop. Josef, stop.<eos> It's my fault. - Josef, it's not your fault.<eos> - It's my fault.<eos> Josef, listen to me!<eos> - Listen to me. - It's my fault.<eos> Stop! Listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You're risking the lives of everyone.<eos> For what?
You should surrender now and save yourselves.<eos> - There's Curda.<eos> - Do you hear me?<eos> - Curda!<eos> - Curda!<eos> You will be treated humanely as prisoners of war.<eos> We are Czechs.<eos> We will never surrender!<eos> We save the last one...<eos> For us.
Last year, you billed for 60 grand, basically in $250 increments, 45 percent of which is uncollected.<eos> That was for the year.<eos> This is for a month or two.<eos> It's more than fair.<eos> Two or three months, I said, not one or two.<eos> And where's the money coming from?<eos> I'm sure his parents don't have it.<eos> They'll have to get it.<eos> Beg, borrow, steal, whatever.<eos> - From who?
The beach?<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> There you go.<eos> Better than the gas chamber.<eos> I'm going out!<eos> Look at you.<eos> A man is in ICU, and you here sleeping like a baby.<eos> You got some secrets in you, don't you?<eos> And some rage.
Really?<eos> Okay. Thank you.<eos> They're out of it, everyone.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Forget it.<eos> - Must be the season of the witch.<eos> Hey, don't make any social plans until Wednesday!<eos> Wednesday!
- Must be the season of the witch.<eos> Hey, don't make any social plans until Wednesday!<eos> Wednesday!<eos> John, you forgot your prescription!<eos> Pharmacy.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right, gents, subway time. What?<eos> Either subway time or overtime.
Alpha Team arriving now.<eos> Copy that.<eos> I have the Alpha Team feed.<eos> Pull them up.<eos> Athens police are reporting tactical teams moving on the demonstrators.<eos> Isolate all social media posts from the Square.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Rewind Alpha 1's feed.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> 20 seconds.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> Rewind Alpha 1's feed.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> 20 seconds.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I hacked into the Agency. For Christian Dassault.<eos> I got all the black ops files, we're putting them online.<eos> We need to move.<eos> Stop.<eos> 2 seconds forward.
I need eyes overhead.<eos> Bring up the satellite's sweep.<eos> Sir, I'm showing a Misty and a KH-12 satellite available.<eos> - Connect to 12.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Satellite video feed is online.<eos> Barricades Detected<eos> Police have blocked the road to the north.<eos> The target will be forced to turn left.<eos> Another barricade in 200 meters.
I... I think you're right.<eos> - I just don't think we want the...<eos> - I'm tired of this.<eos> Mr. Kalloor.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Mr. Kalloor, my name is John Barros.<eos> I'm from the Department of Justice.<eos> And I'm hereby serving you with the enclosed complaint - issued by the US government. - Really, you have to do this in public?<eos> This complaint requires you to preserve all personal and corporate financial records. Pending anti-trust motions to be filed in Federal Court.<eos> Good day.
This complaint requires you to preserve all personal and corporate financial records. Pending anti-trust motions to be filed in Federal Court.<eos> Good day.<eos> - This is Dewey.<eos> - Aaron. It's a message.<eos> And maybe we should think about what we're doing before it gets any worse.<eos> So, you think if we give him what he wants, it will end there.<eos> I'm just saying that maybe we should listen.<eos> I want you to pull up all the records of all the meetings I've had with Dewey.<eos> All the records?<eos> Even the off the books discussions?
LAS VEGAS, NEVADA<eos> Sir.<eos> We're pinning Kalloor's hit on a fictional Jihadi shooter. A 20 year old Iraqi national.<eos> We created bank accounts, travel documents, emails, phone records.<eos> - He'll look like a lone wolf. - Any physical evidence?<eos> The asset leaves the gun, it'll have the Iraqi's prints on it.<eos> Russell doesn't need to know about this.<eos> I understand sir.<eos> Any news on Bourne.<eos> Nothing.
High priority.<eos> Alright guys, I'm going to have to take this.<eos> I'll catch up with you later.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> It appears Director Dewey is held up momentarily, and I'm being told that it shouldn't be too much longer.<eos> But we have a ton of stuff to get into tonight, so we can start anyway.<eos> Uh Brad, can I say a few words?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Can I get the ball rolling?<eos> Oh sure, man. By all means.
What?<eos> We're still looking for Bourne.<eos> And they've IDed the asset.<eos> Go back to the first floor and wait for further instructions.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Everybody down! Right now!<eos> Get down!<eos> Move, move, move!<eos> Out of the way!
Be a lot easier to do it right away.<eos> You didn't come here for revenge. You came here because you know it's time to come in.<eos> Your father created the program. Didn't have what it takes to make it work. And you did.<eos> You always did.<eos> That's why you volunteered.<eos> I volunteered because I thought our enemies killed him.<eos> I volunteered because of a lie. No.<eos> You volunteered because of who you are.<eos> You volunteered because you are Jason Bourne. And not, David Webb.<eos> 32 kills, Jason.
Hi, Larson.<eos> Eddie Larson.<eos> Forced to ride public transportation for the rest of his life.<eos> Just one week after getting his driver's license.<eos> He got drunk and crashed his Chevy Camaro... into the living room of Mr. and Mrs. Howard... killing their 4-year-old son.<eos> Spent three years in juvenile penitentiary... and no doubt the rest of his life in the worst hell of all... the one between the eyes.<eos> How's... how's school, Charlie?<eos> We have a cook.<eos> What, at the school?<eos> At my house.
I just want to know more about you.<eos> I know you want.<eos> I know.<eos> My dear, you have me from morning until night.<eos> And what I do when I leave here is my time.<eos> For me.<eos> Don't take that away.<eos> Tess of the d'Urbervilles.<eos> I've actually read it three times.<eos> Good night.
There are those who talk about everything... but the person who died.<eos> And I told Mr. Rinaldo that two pounds of meat was plenty... but he insisted on giving me three.<eos> And I said, "That's ridiculous..."<eos> There are those who only talk about the person who died.<eos> Your mother was always very nice to me.<eos> I thought she was pretty too.<eos> I always wondered why she didn't have a boyfriend or something.<eos> There are those who try to cheer you up.<eos> Your mother's at peace, Charlie.<eos> Out of pain.
He thought he'd only have to shell out enough for six months.<eos> Mama sure showed him.<eos> Mr. Church?<eos> Two Apple Jacks.<eos> Right on time.<eos> You're welcome. Enjoy.<eos> Oh, that looks wonderful.<eos> Yes.<eos> Apples and sugar.<eos> No secret there.
Mr. Church?<eos> Two Apple Jacks.<eos> Right on time.<eos> You're welcome. Enjoy.<eos> Oh, that looks wonderful.<eos> Yes.<eos> Apples and sugar.<eos> No secret there.<eos> I took clothes and books.<eos> Nothing else.
No more studying.<eos> - No!<eos> - No, we're going out.<eos> Mr. Church wrote me every week.<eos> And always sent me books.<eos> Seasons changed.<eos> Roommates came and went.<eos> Class schedules changed... and I got closer every day towards graduating.<eos> They say, for some, college is the time of your life... where you find yourself.<eos> And for others...
I got one rule.<eos> You respect my privacy.<eos> 'Cause you're in my house now, right?<eos> Yeah, okay. I will.<eos> Okay.<eos> It was like we were never apart.<eos> All right, then.<eos> He never asked a single question about my being pregnant.<eos> Still smoking outside, Mr. Church?<eos> Yeah, as of today.
I... I heard your parents were out.<eos> Living up north somewhere?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I just figured... you stayed in touch with your sister.<eos> My family's gone, Charlie.<eos> Let's not talk of them again.<eos> Look at this one.<eos> It's a birthday gift.<eos> Parisian.
You don't have anything here.<eos> You can't go living with your cook forever.<eos> MY Cook?<eos> Oh, you know what I mean.<eos> What happened to you, Poppy?<eos> You used to be a lot of things... but you were never a snob.<eos> - Charlie...<eos> - You want to know something about my cook?<eos> Richard set aside enough money for Mama to live six months.<eos> Six months.
Well, that's how you know it's a story, my dear.<eos> Once upon a time, there was a little... boy.<eos> What was his name?<eos> What would you like his name to be?<eos> Henry.<eos> Like you.<eos> Well, then Henry it shall be.<eos> Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Henry.<eos> And this boy was afraid of just about everything... except for ladybugs.<eos> - Ladybugs?

Name's Frankie Twiggs.<eos> Folks call me Jelly.<eos> Jelly?<eos> I'm sorry for, you know, barging in... but we hadn't seen Hands for quite some time... and we done missed him, and I just......<eos> "Hands?"<eos> Yeah, that's what we called him on account of...<eos> He played piano at my bar for over 30 years.<eos> So, he worked for you.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Nothing like that.
I suppose everything does happen for a reason.<eos> Mama dying.<eos> Larson saving my baby and himself.<eos> Poppy finding a dollhouse of her own.<eos> Even Owen... the most beautiful 10-year-old boy... on this or any other planet becoming a doctor.<eos> "Dear Charlotte."<eos> "You've said you just want to know me."<eos> "My dear, you always have."<eos> "I'm simply a man."<eos> "Not without faults."
A wizard!<eos> More people sitting now as Abrams has made it irrelevant.<eos> Who saw this coming?<eos> And there's the rest of the anthem, all the parts we remembered and loved.<eos> J.J. Abrams has fixed America.<eos> No!<eos> This was supposed to... oh!<eos> Oh, geez!<eos> Hey, Kyle.<eos> You okay, son?

Is there a rule that says a girl can't run the Gauntlet?<eos> That's the way it's always been.<eos> We have female commanders in the Elvin army, and women on the High Council.<eos> It's time the Four Lands had a female Chosen.<eos> You knew about this?<eos> Who do you think sneaked her past the Home Guard and out of the palace?<eos> The Gauntlet is dangerous, Amberle.<eos> These guys will do anything to win.<eos> So will I.<eos> Then good luck.
(creaking)<eos> Mmm.<eos> So aren't you worried about Rovers?<eos> What do you know about Rovers?<eos> One look at you and they'd take the clothes off your back and steal your little bag of blue rocks.<eos> (Elfstones clacking)<eos> I need those back.<eos> Why?<eos> Are they valuable?<eos> Only to me.
I dismissed it until I found this in her room.<eos> ♪♪<eos> Demons?<eos> She sketched them before the Druid showed up.<eos> It can't be a coincidence.<eos> Until we are certain, I want all the Chosen and the entire Elvin Council taken to the palace for safety.<eos> Black Watch will guard them night and day.<eos> My mentor told me that he hid the Codex in this chamber before the Keep fell.<eos> When was that?<eos> 300 years ago.
You think we could focus on me for a while now?<eos> Come here, what was it like?<eos> Would have been nice to hear from you.<eos> Said you didn't want visitors.<eos> You could have wrote, like.<eos> You should have told me, like...<eos> Where the fuck is he?<eos> Just text him and tell him we're goin' drinkin'.<eos> - No.<eos> - Please?
- No.<eos> - Please?<eos> No!<eos> Why not?<eos> Cos the wedding is this day, three weeks, and I've fuckin' a hundred and one things to be doin'.<eos> How come I didn't get a plus one?<eos> Cos the plates are like 60 quid.<eos> Everyone you know is gonna be there.<eos> What?<eos> Nothin'.
Do you have a girlfriend?<eos> - I have a wife.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I knew the first night I met Declan, that he was the one for Charlene.<eos> He was a kind-hearted bloke.<eos> And a nice man.<eos> Plus, he bought the two of us loads of drinks, so that was cool.<eos> Char was always the confident one with fellas.<eos> Whereas with me, I never really bothered that much cos I think most fellas from Drogheda are all dopes.<eos> No offence, to any of ya's here tonight, though.
- For the laugh.<eos> - What are you on about?<eos> I suppose.<eos> Any interest in goin' to a weddin', no?<eos> I'll see ya around, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dates.<eos> No matter how great life is, it's always better when you have someone special to share it with.<eos> Here at Cupid's Arrow, we provide a unique personal introduction service that is designed to help you meet someone special.<eos> No more single ads.

Because I don't want to.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I have a number here I can give you.<eos> No, she wanted you.<eos> I'm sure Charlene will get over it.<eos> No, she really won't.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Fine.<eos> I will cancel my gig for you.<eos> Thanks.
Sorry.<eos> So, who is he?<eos> - You don't know him.<eos> - Yeah, well, what's his name?<eos> John.<eos> "John" what?<eos> Carter.<eos> From Mars?<eos> What?<eos> The film.
Mmm?<eos> A bit more.<eos> A bit more.<eos> Ta-da!<eos> I'm giving you the famous J-Lo glow.<eos> It's exciting', isn't it?<eos> No.<eos> Any advice?<eos> You're askin' her for advice?<eos> Yes, Mam.
Hey, it's me.<eos> So I was readin' this really interesting thing in the paper earlier.<eos> It said that the best night ever to go out with Mary is a Tuesday night?<eos> So...<eos> Call me back.<eos> So, do you do anything like that yourself?<eos> - What?<eos> - Like sport or drama?<eos> No.<eos> Any interests at all?
I thought I was supposed to write it.<eos> Well, I did it for ya.<eos> Right?<eos> Nice outfit.<eos> - Weddin' video.<eos> - Wedding video.<eos> How's it goin'?<eos> Good.<eos> So what are you up to?<eos> Nothin'.
Fuckin' lawsuit.<eos> You all right?<eos> Did ya enjoy the show?<eos> What show?<eos> You do realise you're bleeding?<eos> You didn't have to come with me.<eos> I know.<eos> Good night?<eos> Hardly.<eos> You?
And that one's for free.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> What can I get ya?<eos> All right?<eos> Jess!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey!<eos> I saw you from the bus so I, like, I ran from, like, all the way back there...<eos> - No way!<eos> - Yeah, past the lights.
She knows her mother stops here every Monday morning.<eos> She runs off and meets a friend waiting at a hiding place.<eos> Max?<eos> It's unlikely she was kidnapped.<eos> Her parents are successful. No ransom demand has yet been made.<eos> As for a sexual predator just passing by and snatching her in plain sight...<eos> One thing's for sure: she's gone.<eos> Notice something between the mother and the attendant?<eos> First name basis.<eos> Thomas this, Thomas that.
We'll see later.<eos> You suck.<eos> You suck!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Éric, we've got another runaway.<eos> Wait for me over there.<eos> Mélissa Terrail, barely 16.<eos> She didn't show up for the morning treatment.<eos> Roadblocks?<eos> Nothing yet.
I can still see the look she gave me that day.<eos> We had to do it, it was the only-<eos> The only way was to keep her at home!<eos> Any idea where she could have gone?<eos> Family, friends?<eos> If I knew where she was, I wouldn't be here, would I?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Mélissa's parents?<eos> - Yes. What have you got?<eos> Nothing special.
Psychogenic blindness is not a recurring condition.<eos> Tell that to the police head doctor.<eos> He doesn't want me to drive.<eos> Please sit down.<eos> I'm fine, thanks.<eos> I'm no longer ill.<eos> The symptoms you showed last month indicate that your mental defences were overwhelmed.<eos> It may now be that other repressed memories are coming back to the surface.<eos> Mr Lanester, if you wish to begin psychoanalysis, we'll have to lay down some rules.<eos> First, no more sudden visits.
They also ran away.<eos> This one, yes.<eos> But her, I'm not sure.<eos> But her face rings a bell.<eos> Don't you have CCTV cameras?<eos> No.<eos> Should I?<eos> Éric.<eos> She went onto one site only.<eos> That of the clinic. Six times in 2 minutes.
That of the clinic. Six times in 2 minutes.<eos> It lists all the dangers of anorexia but nothing about Éluard or poetry.<eos> It's weird, though.<eos> She runs away from the clinic and then goes onto its website?<eos> Mr Kumar, this must stay between us.<eos> Don't tell anyone that Mélissa is dead.<eos> All right.<eos> Why?<eos> Sarah, Delphine, Mélissa.<eos> Three friends, three runaways.
Still physiotherapy? No, I give photography lessons here.<eos> This priory belongs to my partner.<eos> An old international reporter.<eos> Hi, sorry, I really need to go.<eos> May I use your loo?<eos> She's my driver.<eos> Can't it wait?<eos> Please, come in.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.
Xavier, I'm talking to you.<eos> You all right?<eos> I juggle with my job to see him but it's as if I didn't exist. - Did you speak to him?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Like a normal person?<eos> My brother isn't normal.<eos> You know that, but does he?<eos> Let's go, I'm bushed.<eos> There, I knew I'd seen it somewhere.<eos> - What? - The photo in Croft's office.
So I copied her.<eos> I went on and off several times.<eos> Nothing changed except for the pop-ups.<eos> The banner ads that appear when browsing the Web.<eos> There it is.<eos> It links to a swotting website for revising French classics, including Éluard and Freedom.<eos> Now if you click on the second stanza like this, you go to a very interesting blog.<eos> A real sight for sore eyes.<eos> It gives plenty tips for those who think skinny is sexy.<eos> Loads of them.
Of course you exist.<eos> You've existed at my place for some time.<eos> Being near isn't the same as being close.<eos> Seriously, you sound like my...<eos> Your wife?<eos> You don't have one.<eos> She's dead. Your overpriced shrink? You're more unbearable than usual after seeing her.<eos> Éric.<eos> Before leaving he called British Airways to inquire about flights to New York.<eos> - How long ago?
Life as you and I know it has left him.<eos> You still have a choice.<eos> You can either let the guilt eating away at you take over, or you can trust those who love you.<eos> You must decide today.<eos> Now.<eos> Afterwards might be too late.<eos> Mr Lanester. Could you please stay for a bit?<eos> Delphine went back home.<eos> Things should work out now.<eos> What about you?
They gave you a little more pluck, Dolores.<eos> Absolutely charming.<eos> Take your hands off her.<eos> Oh, Teddy.<eos> Any special tricks for us?<eos> They teach you to sit up, beg?<eos> How about I give you the first shot, hmm?<eos> After all, every dog has his day.<eos> Well, your mouth move fast enough.<eos> How about your gun?
You updated the guy, and now he's a six-foot gourd with epilepsy.<eos> So what the fuck happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, that's exactly what you want to hear from your head of programming.<eos> We haven't finished the diagnostic yet.<eos> Clearly it's exhibiting some aberrant behavior.<eos> Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie.<eos> Your hosts get sick, they get lost, but this is grotesque.<eos> Is it a problem with the update?<eos> Possible, but not likely.
What do you think management's real interests are?<eos> You're smart enough to guess there's a bigger picture, but not smart enough to see what it is.<eos> You know how much use that makes your support to me?<eos> Fuck all.<eos> Get some sleep, Mr. Sizemore.<eos> You'll have more rich assholes to gratify tomorrow.<eos> Early night, Maeve?<eos> Feeling a bit out of sorts.<eos> Clementine can pick up the slack.<eos> Night.
Until then, may you rest in a deep and dreamless slumber.<eos> Two more over here.<eos> We got them all.<eos> That's all of them.<eos> Any preliminary results?<eos> Most of them are checking out fine.<eos> We had one who... definitely was not.<eos> Bring her back online.<eos> Cognition only.<eos> No emotional affect.
First, have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?<eos> No.<eos> Has anyone around you?<eos> For instance, your father?<eos> He was scared.<eos> He wasn't thinking right.<eos> He showed you a picture.<eos> That's right.<eos> Was there anything odd about that picture?<eos> No, nothing at all.
Who left the butter out to melt, for goodness' sake?<eos> - Let's say for a minute I'm God.<eos> - Why would we ever say that?<eos> I'm God and you're Adam.<eos> How are we going to go about finding your Eve, Sidney?<eos> God didn't find Eve.<eos> He made her.<eos> Made her?<eos> I never did fathom that.<eos> Why a rib?
Wouldn't happen to know where she is, would you?<eos> No.<eos> Bring me a Bible, I will swear on it.<eos> I don't think there's any need for that sort of rigmarole.<eos> I'm satisfied, are you?<eos> Pleasure as always, Mr Chambers.<eos> - Margaret.<eos> - Constable.<eos> Nice arse on her, that one.<eos> - For a secretary.
And what if you can't forgive yourself?<eos> Abigail!<eos> Get in the car!<eos> Don't make me go home.<eos> What are you afraid of?<eos> Your mother's waiting.<eos> Abigail, what are you afraid of?<eos> Neighbours saw Marlowe last night.<eos> Leaving in a hurry, by all accounts.<eos> - No sign of the diary?

- I know he works here. Where is he?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> Where's he hiding?<eos> Eh?<eos> I take it a bribe won't be enough this time.<eos> Shut up, you bastard.<eos> - I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder.<eos> - What?<eos> You're not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but what you say may be put into writing and given in evidence.<eos> 15 years old.
Sorry.<eos> 'I take it a bribe won't be enough this time? '<eos> What do you make of that?<eos> - Marlowe's bought his way out of an arrest before.<eos> - For what?<eos> He's divorced, I believe.<eos> Left his wife some years back.<eos> - No sign of a lady friend?<eos> - No.<eos> Not a LADY friend...?
Ah, once you look, they're everywhere.<eos> - Crawling out the bloody woodwork.<eos> - Well, that puts a dampener on our theory that HE got her pregnant.<eos> - If only we had that diary.<eos> - There is no diary, Sidney.<eos> - You don't know that for certain, Geordie.<eos> - It's a fiction.<eos> Like God, the angels and the multitude of the heavenly... whatsits.<eos> Hosts.<eos> Heavenly hosts.
What the hell are you doing parked here?<eos> It's the middle of the road!<eos> Sorry...<eos> I think my battery's flat or I've run out of petrol.<eos> Aren't you cold?<eos> How long have you been here?<eos> Can I have a lift, please?<eos> Don't you have luggage?<eos> Where are you from?<eos> - London
I'd think about it pretty carefully, if I was you.<eos> I haven't got your gear.<eos> Ask Chloe<eos> It didn't take long to throw your girlfriend in it.<eos> Did it? She's not my girlfriend.<eos> Not by choice, I'm guessing.<eos> I dumped her.<eos> I told her she'd get in trouble.<eos> What sort of trouble?<eos> From you
Where did you find this?<eos> - You dropped it at the party.<eos> Looks like a Lomatia tasmanica.<eos> Commonly known as the King's Lomatia.<eos> It's a paper flower.<eos> My patient made it for me.<eos> I doubt she modelled it on some rare Tasmanian species.<eos> How did it get out of my coat pocket?<eos> What, you don't remember?<eos> What?
No, she just likes to keep her parents on their toes.<eos> You were... with her at the party, right?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Eliza Grayson, Chloe's best friend.<eos> I think her nose is a little bit out of joint.<eos> I was home by eleven.<eos> Chloe was partying pretty hard.<eos> Chloe was frightened of something ... someone.<eos> She wanted to leave.<eos> The party?

Can you tell me if this is Chloe's phone?<eos> Fergus?<eos> - What is it? - Um...<eos> Well, I don't know, mate.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> What is it?<eos> Why is it all smashed up?<eos> Where'd you find it?<eos> It was found in Kettering Forest.<eos> About a K from the greenie camp.
We just pretend.<eos> Chloe and I always do that stuff. You know... Just muck around.<eos> Guess I just wanted to be a part of it.<eos> Thought you might want a lift to work.<eos> Ah, I'm all right.<eos> Dane. Where are the drugs?<eos> I went round to Chloe's. Her mum wouldn't leave me alone.<eos> - They're in her drawer.<eos> - Which drawer?<eos> One at the bottom of her bed.
Chloe shouldn't be dealing in the first place.<eos> But I don't care who took 'em.<eos> - I want my money.<eos> Dane.<eos> You were with me...<eos> Friday night.<eos> Franklin Shed.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because of the storm.
All the cars are full.<eos> They're looking up at the Kettering Forest, aren't they?<eos> Same as with Gillian.<eos> You saw the lights, Renae, didn't you?<eos> Why don't you keep your mouth shut?<eos> I want to find her, too.<eos> I can help.<eos> I think it's better for everybody if you just stayed here.<eos> Watch your back, Deb.<eos> Christ's sake.
I wondered if you knew about that day.<eos> The day Gillian went.<eos> I knew that's why you called. That you'd come back.<eos> I want to know.<eos> When they brought you in, I hardly recognised you as the same little girl.<eos> Who brought me in?<eos> Roy, of course.<eos> Someone had cleaned you up.<eos> There was a lot of blood under your fingernails.<eos> Whose blood?
Next thing I know, Lofty's arrested.<eos> Why did you leave Kettering?<eos> Because I wasn't allowed to be a good doctor.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Things started happening.<eos> I thought at first possibly an allergy had taken hold.<eos> But then, strange cancers.<eos> I mean, it's a small town, but there were so many cancers.<eos> Gut, spleen, things you don't normally see.<eos> Like Deb Russell.
You're a liar.<eos> Why did you come back?<eos> It's my home.<eos> You don't have a home.<eos> ♪ Ah ♪ When she comes walking over ♪ Now I've been waiting to show her<eos> ♪ Over and over Gillian, you have to go home now.<eos> Anna has homework.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.
- Bit of a blur, really.<eos> - What do you mean by "blur"?<eos> - As I said, I was jet-lagged. - What time did you get home?<eos> - I didn't check the time.<eos> How did Chloe seem when you left her?<eos> Seem?<eos> What was her state of mind?<eos> She was intoxicated.<eos> Remind me. You took the dog for a walk. What time did you get home from the walk?<eos> - Around 4:00.
Like vampires feeding at the grief.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The injustice.<eos> What injustice?<eos> I don't need you to try and make this better, to try and make me feel better.<eos> There's nothing to sort out, there's nothing to try and get through. There's nothing. There's just...<eos> I used to look at you and think that that was the worst thing. The not knowing.<eos> - It is. -No, it's not.<eos> I've got nothing now.<eos> Nothing.
The rash?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Told him not to go out at night, but he doesn't listen to me.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> Said he didn't even know he'd left the house.<eos> Do you sometimes wake up and you don't know where you are?<eos> And lots of time's gone past?<eos> Kade, when you wake up, are you always in the same place?<eos> Go on, tell her.<eos> Mo-fo's.
Max.<eos> I, erm...<eos> I got some letters.<eos> What letters?<eos> What'd they say, Max?<eos> They were just bullshit.<eos> - What'd they say?<eos> - I don't know. Just stupid things.<eos> Were they threatening?<eos> Well, no different to the usual.
Kettering incident time.<eos> It's all in his files, if he hasn't conveniently lost them.<eos> Hello?<eos> Tried calling you father, but he wasn't answering.<eos> Dr. Patrick's on his way in.<eos> You'd better steel yourself.<eos> We can't risk giving her any more Midazolam.<eos> What dose have you given her?<eos> - 20mg over the previous hour.<eos> -20 mg?
It's just orbiting on top of me ...<eos> It's got a green light.<eos> Some sort of metallic ...<eos> It's an old kind of aircraft I've got.<eos> - Oh Deb, where do you want these?<eos> - Hi Sharon.<eos> Just on the shelf.<eos> - How's Eliza?<eos> - Getting more like a Grayson everyday.<eos> No offense.
It's hard to tell with 'Lize y'know.<eos> Bit like her father there.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> How the bloody hell did that get here?<eos> It's moss.<eos> Bloody forest is creeping in.<eos> 23...<eos> You sure the shed was locked up tight the night of the storm? Yep<eos> And there was no one in there Friday night?<eos> Absolutely no one in there.
You sure the shed was locked up tight the night of the storm? Yep<eos> And there was no one in there Friday night?<eos> Absolutely no one in there.<eos> Righto, thanks.<eos> Hello?<eos> Fergus, you there?<eos> Fergus?<eos> Does he know you're doing that?<eos> I'm just looking for something for dad.<eos> For his big night.
- Can I take this?<eos> - Sure, I've got more samples.<eos> - Sorry I was late back there.<eos> - Kayak peak hour, was it?<eos> Look, be careful what you say in there.<eos> Let's keep it pretty simple and loose for now.<eos> Barb was asking about Chloe's cardigan.<eos> - What cardigan?<eos> - She thought you took it.<eos> For the dogs?
Did I say that?<eos> - I don't remember<eos> - They put me in jail<eos> Can you tell me exactly what happened that night, please?<eos> Found you at Mother Sullivan's<eos> I picked you up.<eos> Carried you for miles.<eos> I wasn't at Mother Sullivan's<eos> I couldn't have got up there.<eos> At my grandmother's house.
He's mentally deficient, Anna.<eos> He used to stalk you and Gillian<eos> You've put words in my mouth I couldn't possibly have said<eos> There's not a word of truth in here, is there?<eos> And yet you ignored other witnesses<eos> Why? - Because you ran out of this house -- screaming blue murder when you found out Gillian was your sister.<eos> And then you disappeared with her for over eight hours<eos> - Not eight hours, that's wrong<eos> - Yes ...<eos> Eight long, terrible, bloody hours.
Roy Macy<eos> First up, we have Deb Russell to say a few words<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I could ask you the same question<eos> What are they?<eos> Just an old pair of goggles I found up on the ridge<eos> What were you doing up there?<eos> Looking for a crime scene<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Nothing
I could ask you the same question<eos> What are they?<eos> Just an old pair of goggles I found up on the ridge<eos> What were you doing up there?<eos> Looking for a crime scene<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Nothing<eos> Do you think that's where Chloe was killed?<eos> Maybe<eos> No weapon, no vehicle, no crime scene
Can you call me back, please?<eos> I need to speak to you.<eos> You can let Lofty out.<eos> Results of the blood came in and, they match seal blood, just like you said.<eos> It's a pity, I thought we could wrap this up.<eos> Who have we got left?<eos> I'm still intrigued by Anna's claim that Chloe was scared of someone.<eos> Right, let's narrow down some facts.<eos> Who hasn't got an alibi?<eos> Travis Kingston.
Right, let's narrow down some facts.<eos> Who hasn't got an alibi?<eos> Travis Kingston.<eos> Still missing.<eos> Have they got back to us about the paint flakes and the glass?<eos> No, still being analysed.<eos> Awaiting on the results of two tyre prints but they both belong to a smaller car.<eos> I've got a partial fingerprint here.<eos> Who else has no alibi after 11 pm?<eos> Craig Grayson.
And some bastard's out there getting away with it because you and I are here, fart arseing around, taking swipes at each other.<eos> We need to pull together.<eos> I'm not going to stop, Dutch.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Great ...<eos> Come on.<eos> - Try it again.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> What the fuck?
I'm not going to stop, Dutch.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Great ...<eos> Come on.<eos> - Try it again.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> What the fuck!
I wasn't there for her, Max.<eos> I wasn't there.<eos> Don't leave me, Barb.<eos> Chloe wouldn't want that.<eos> We're okay.<eos> We're going to be okay.<eos> You're gonna have to get another job.<eos> I need more for rent.<eos> D'ya hear me?<eos> Yes, mum.
Just get this over and done with<eos> There's got to be ...<eos> C'mon, there's got to be another way.<eos> Not that I can bloody see.<eos> Right.<eos> Ok, go!<eos> This doesn't feel right.<eos> We can't take the risk.<eos> I have no intention of doing time.<eos> Especially not for a piece of shit like him
Thumbing it at her dad.<eos> At you blokes.<eos> Don't.<eos> She's a kid.<eos> She's a stupid rebellious kid.<eos> Was.<eos> Pardon?<eos> 'Was' a stupid rebellious kid.<eos> What time did you get home from the party?<eos> About midnight.
She was always crazy mad for pink.<eos> What are you doin' here?<eos> Where's Eliza, is she here?<eos> Yeah, she's in her room.<eos> Craig ...<eos> Eliza.<eos> Eliza?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> It's a moth tattoo.<eos> Like Chloe's.
What are you doin' here?<eos> Where's Eliza, is she here?<eos> Yeah, she's in her room.<eos> Craig ...<eos> Eliza.<eos> Eliza?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> It's a moth tattoo.<eos> Like Chloe's.<eos> What the hell?
Is this Chloe's camera?<eos> How long have you had this?<eos> Eliza, where did you get it?<eos> I found it.<eos> Would somebody tell me what's going on?<eos> Found it where?<eos> Eliza, stop it!<eos> She's coming with me.<eos> Feels like there's a storm brewing, son.<eos> Yeah, pop.
He told me about a signal.<eos> He first heard it around the time Gillian disappeared.<eos> It came out from Antarctica, and then he heard it here.<eos> What is it?<eos> I think it's got something to do with this sphere.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - I'm not sure but, look at the pattern, on the side.<eos> It's the same as the markings on Kade and Chloe, and mum.<eos> Eliza has those markings.<eos> - Eliza?
It was found on Chloe's belt.<eos> - Meaning if they took your fingerprint, they'd have a match.<eos> I know you killed Chloe.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> She was already dead when I found her.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> She was out the back of the old Sullivan house.<eos> I moved her body to protect people.<eos> What people?
Because it's only the truth that's left now<eos> Renae?<eos> Renae?<eos> Door's unlocked.<eos> Renae, you home?<eos> I'll check the garage.<eos> Righto.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Bloody electricity, that'd be next.<eos> No water, no electricity.
Fergus?<eos> The car's not in the garage.<eos> What's that?<eos> I saw this lipstick on Chloe's camera.<eos> It was sitting in the grass.<eos> It was the last photo taken that night.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What?<eos> The spare keys to the Jag.<eos> To Anna's car.
Geils is fine.<eos> He's right over there.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Oh, he told me you were dead.<eos> Ohh. Oh, my god.<eos> That's hilarious.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, he should stay off it for a while.<eos> Little ice, little heat.
I was wrong.<eos> You are just a man.<eos> Just a man.<eos> A man of war.<eos> War made both of us, after all.<eos> Ain't no way out of this one, Swede.<eos> No.<eos> The way out is...<eos> Is by your...<eos> Your hand.
"Thor Gundersen, late of Salt Lake City, not having the fear of God before your eyes, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil, have been found guilty of feloniously and willfully with malice aforethought of depriving Aaron Hatch and Sara Hatch of life so that they then and there instantly died.<eos> The sentence is death.<eos> You shall be hanged by the neck until dead."<eos> May the Lord have mercy upon your soul.<eos> Uh, no, not this.<eos> Please, not this...<eos> I ca... Please, please.<eos> Have you any last words?<eos> I am Thor Gundersen.<eos> From Norway.
I'm warm, I'm safe. Got a full belly.<eos> - I ought to feel grateful, but...<eos> - Ennui.<eos> On what?<eos> There's a certain dissatisfaction sets in when we get what we think we want.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ennui.<eos> I guess that's it.<eos> - How long have they been there?<eos> - Since this morning.
It only ever felt like I caught a tiny piece of your heart...<eos> This one dark night in a lonesome barn...<eos> One night of sin...<eos> Don't say that.<eos> It's why I went with you to the railroad.<eos> 'Cause I'd already asked so much of you, I...<eos> I couldn't ask you to stay in that fort.<eos> And Cheyenne seemed exciting at the time.<eos> Just wasn't the right thing.<eos> Not for William.
I guess I better get back to the cut, then.<eos> There's pieces in there still.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Doctor couldn't get it all.<eos> It won't ever heal then.<eos> Some things don't.<eos> You should get some sleep.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll go check on William.<eos> - Good night. - Yeah.
Listen up.<eos> Prepare to translate.<eos> And make haste, for Christ's sake.<eos> I hate it down here.<eos> Attention all Jakes.<eos> Bossy man Huntington back from Utah.<eos> He say: Picky uppy pac.<eos> Doleime, ching-chong.<eos> Longer shifts.<eos> No more breaks.
Attention all Jakes.<eos> Bossy man Huntington back from Utah.<eos> He say: Picky uppy pac.<eos> Doleime, ching-chong.<eos> Longer shifts.<eos> No more breaks.<eos> And bonuses for every man at tunnel's end.<eos> Bohannon?<eos> He back?<eos> From Utah?
There is no man livin' I would rather marry, New York.<eos> But it's a racket.<eos> I've tried it.<eos> Besides, I would rather hang on to my hard-fought assets.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - I don't want your hotel, I want you.<eos> I had promised myself I'd never walk down the aisle again.<eos> But I will hire a girl and accompany you to the end of the line, if you make me one promise.<eos> Name it.<eos> No more schemes.
No more schemes.<eos> Cheatin' people, it leaves a bad taste.<eos> It is in the nature of the lion to eat the zebra.<eos> - Come back to bed.<eos> - Promise me.<eos> All right, I promise.<eos> Thomas, promise me.<eos> I promise.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> A herd of zebra.
Frontier's justice, Mr. City Slicker.<eos> You may have got a slippery tongue but that don't make me bullet-proof.<eos> What exactly is it that you want?<eos> We want the money you stole from us.<eos> Right now.<eos> In you go, slick.<eos> Open it.<eos> - Gentlemen...<eos> - No more of your slippery bullshit.<eos> $50,000.
He's perfect.<eos> All yours, madam.<eos> How much do you think I'm worth to the Railroad?<eos> Were I to go missing?<eos> Let's say, masked men kidnap me for my private car, in front of Mr. Delaney.<eos> They demand $250,000 for my return.<eos> And threaten to kill me, if Delaney reveals this to anybody except the board.<eos> The board hopes to avoid the plummeting share price that would result in the breaking news of their president's kidnapping.<eos> So, they agree to send the funds within the day.<eos> Voila.
I found the money.<eos> The funds are being wired.<eos> Why...!<eos> Stop!<eos> No!<eos> There are only three others like it on this planet.<eos> Imagine how valuable it is.<eos> That, sir, is no trinket, oh, no.<eos> That is a piece of history, forged from the golden spike.<eos> - Golden what?
Durant burned this whole town with his land scheme and I helped...<eos> I helped him create more enemies than you can count.<eos> The board will pay, Maggie.<eos> Once these men get what they want, Durant will walk free.<eos> It'll be over soon.<eos> It's from the Union Pacific in New York...<eos> The Union Pacific board is refusing to pay the ransom.<eos> They've referred the matter to the federal government.<eos> Laramie's welcome wagon, led by a criminal...<eos> No surprise there.
Short words.<eos> He was... He was trying not to speak.<eos> After Marty tried to stop him...<eos> He didn't have to shoot him.<eos> And after the leader murdered Mr. Delaney?<eos> There were two riders who held up the railroad crew.<eos> They put Durant on a horse and rode off.<eos> Look, Durant always owes people money.<eos> If we can look at the Railroad's books...<eos> - The books?
What are you doing here?<eos> No one else thought you were worth saving.<eos> We'll be needin' the cash, darlin'.<eos> Come on.<eos> There's $50,000 in there.<eos> You just take it and go.<eos> Look, we need to take this money and get the hell out of here.<eos> Take the damn money.<eos> Take it and get of here.<eos> $250,000.
I'll need more duck, Mr. Chang.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - Here.<eos> - Here?<eos> Nosey little man, ain't you?<eos> Next time, ask.<eos> Your fare already paid and then some.<eos> $2 for dress.<eos> You got a lady waiting on you in Cheyenne?<eos> $5.
Next time, ask.<eos> Your fare already paid and then some.<eos> $2 for dress.<eos> You got a lady waiting on you in Cheyenne?<eos> $5.<eos> - I paid 10.<eos> - Paid who?<eos> Ain't for sale.<eos> Everything for sale.<eos> $20.
Annually.<eos> Wai-Ling's made me $30,000 in five years.<eos> The suppleness of her breasts, the slender size of her waist, the length and form of her legs, all these factors predict the healthy earning years a prostitute earns.<eos> Forty thousand.<eos> That's five there and you'll have rest by the end of the week.<eos> The extra 10 is for your insurance that Fong is free and clear.<eos> Are you in love with her?<eos> If the price ain't fair, son, name one.<eos> I named my price months ago.<eos> A 2% stake in the railroad.
You wouldn't jeopardize your entire business for one man, would you?<eos> The General says the Sze Yup's services will continue without interruption.<eos> He will send one of his best company men, Ling Lee.<eos> He speak English?<eos> You'll find him of equal use and value to you as Mr. Chang.<eos> Ah, it's truly a shame.<eos> Mr. Chang was a forward-thinking businessman.<eos> Chang pimp.<eos> Taiping rebel.<eos> Nothing more.

Matsumoto, Supervisor of Defensive Operational Policy<eos> We've prepared for a wildlife-based threat before.<eos> But never with Self-Defense Forces using weapons in Tokyo Bay.<eos> Why blow it up?<eos> They're already calling for it's live capture as a valuable new species. No, extermination's the answer.<eos> A few torpedoes?<eos> The use of weapons requires careful examination of options.<eos> I, too, side strongly with the option of live capture.<eos> Start gathering intel on the unidentified creature quickly.<eos> Extermination, capture and expulsions.
Let's get to it.<eos> Thank you. I rushed to Yokota straight from a party, so I didn't ha time to change.<eos> Where's Zara?<eos> Kayoco Anne Patterson.<eos> She's very young.<eos> America admirably values performance over age.<eos> And she's Senator Patterson's daughter.<eos> The one behind the Kern Agreement.<eos> Formidable.<eos> A mixture of talent, pedigree and coattails.
Confirm the contents?<eos> No need.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Special ink.<eos> Can't be copied.<eos> I'll take photos to share with my team.<eos> Godzilla?<eos> That's right. It's the DOE's code name. "Godzilla".<eos> He gave it an English name.<eos> Gojira.
I got one hit.<eos> On Ohdo Island, where he's from, it means "God incarnate".<eos> A violent one. I hear that's why he put "God" in the name.<eos> In Japanese, the name read "Gojira."<eos> "Gojira" you say?<eos> Who cares about its name at this point?<eos> It's just as well it originated in the US.<eos> Now we know what to call it.<eos> The government is unofficially calling the giant creature "Gojira."<eos> National Diet Building Gardens, Chiyoda Ward

This is about not being able to find a link between Maura's kidnapper, Joe Harris, and Jane.<eos> Since Harris leads us nowhere, I circled back to the hacker who broke into your sister's bank accounts.<eos> Hoping that he can lead us to whoever's behind all this.<eos> Exactly.<eos> This is wingate bouncing.<eos> Hacker's hiding his I.P. address by bouncing the signal to hundreds of servers.<eos> The only thing I've learned so far is how badly this guy does not want to be found.<eos> Speaking of found, you got anything on our dead robber?<eos> - Theodore "Teddy" White. - Oh.<eos> 35 years old from Charlestown.
- Who?<eos> - What?<eos> Jane, this has got to stop.<eos> You are not responsible for me or Maura.<eos> Okay, this is about someone who is trying to hurt, potentially kill, the people that I love.<eos> Someone that I'm in charge of finding. Okay?<eos> But for all we know, whoever was behind this could've been scared off when Joe Harris died.<eos> What if he wasn't?<eos> As requested, a random sampling of product from the Pot Palace.<eos> - For investigatory purposes only.
- Well, that's big of you.<eos> Hey, look around, I've got plenty of product to cover a loss.<eos> It's not like I'm gonna kill somebody over it.<eos> You sure of that?<eos> Look at me, bro.<eos> I mean, do I look like Pablo Escobar?<eos> I mean... anyway, it's not ... not the way it was with Otis.<eos> He was ... he was a solid customer.<eos> - When's the last time you saw him?<eos> - 15 years ago?
- 15 years ago?<eos> Otis and I did a little business together when we were in college.<eos> And then, you know, we drifted apart.<eos> But he called me, like, five months ago.<eos> - How did he get your number?<eos> - This is the house I grew up in.<eos> And so, like, the number's not changed.<eos> And Otis called 'cause he wanted to do some business together again.<eos> But he didn't want to meet face-to-face, so he just left the money at the drop-off, and I dropped off, you know, the package.<eos> Legally.
No, I-I definitely left it in my desk when I came back from the prison.<eos> Are you sure they know I'm involved?<eos> No.<eos> I would never tell them about you.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> The tunnel.<eos> Yes.<eos> And ... And I-I need you to know that I'm sorry.<eos> Okay?
You need to trust us to do our job.<eos> On a different note, I do have something on that encryption key found at the murder scene.<eos> It's a digital account authenticator.<eos> The serial number for this one is registered to an assistant manager at First Cambridge bank, Perry Shaw.<eos> - Any criminal record?<eos> - Clean as a whistle.<eos> And I just called ... he's at work today, so he wasn't another victim.<eos> - We should go talk to him.<eos> - Yes, we should.<eos> After you.
That'd be cool.<eos> You're going undercover. You're not going on vacation.<eos> - Yeah. I sure hope it's not spiders.<eos> - Spiders?<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Well, uh, people find spiders scary, that's all.<eos> I wouldn't be at all surprised if it was spiders ... a big, ol' web with hundreds of 'em.<eos> - It's not gonna be spiders!<eos> - You never know.<eos> - No spiders!
- Honestly, we all thought that she probably went off on a bender.<eos> - She was a heavy drinker?<eos> - Used to be.<eos> She'd been sober about a year now, but she had fallen off the wagon before.<eos> What exactly was her role that night?<eos> She was, uh, one of the sadistic kidnappers.<eos> She would make these terrifying threats, and then the buzz saw was really loud.<eos> So once people were good and scared, she would just leave them alone for a while ... you know, really build up the fear.<eos> Sounds like you've got it down to a science.<eos> More of an art.
- I do.<eos> - So, how about you talk to me?<eos> We talked to all the actors who were there the night of the murder ... mostly college students, none with any criminal record.<eos> "I'm not a murderer, I just play one on the weekends"?<eos> We'll keep digging, but nothing's jumping out.<eos> There was one guy that worked in the basement with Dani,<eos> - but he's a size 9 shoe.<eos> - So, that's not our guy.<eos> Nobody knew of any problems she was having.<eos> No ex-boyfriends, no threats.
Boston P.D.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> This party's just getting started.<eos> Hi.<eos> You talk to Philly P.D. yet?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They talked to Gus Brooks at his apartment.<eos> He swears he hasn't been back to Boston since Karen Hughes filed the restraining order.<eos> He have an alibi?<eos> Not a good one ...
- Is everything all right, detective?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> Um, i-if you could just sit tight until we get there ...<eos> Karen?<eos> Go, go.<eos> He's alive.<eos> - Anything?<eos> - No.<eos> You?<eos> No, nothing.
I'm more than okay with it.<eos> I'm thrilled.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Where you going?<eos> I got one more case to solve today.<eos> Yeah, it's for a really good cause.<eos> - Mm.<eos> All right, well, I'll take 100.<eos> - A 100?
Gunfight.<eos> One dead.<eos> - Witnesses?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Nobody's talking.<eos> You know the drill.<eos> It's an ethnic neighborhood.<eos> Nobody trusts the cops.<eos> What is it, a drive-by?<eos> More like gunfight at the O.K. Corral.
- Well, that's fantastic.<eos> He could be from any neighborhood in Boston.<eos> I did remove a small piece of metal with a plastic coating from the boot.<eos> We'll run some tests and see if we can determine its origin.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, anything you can find will help 'cause, so far, all we have are two John Does shooting at each other.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Nina pulled a good image<eos> - of the shooter's face from the security video.
Can you I.D. him?<eos> Well, right now we just have a nickname for him here.<eos> He goes by "Little Nicky" on the street.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Then, a couple of months ago, he had a falling-out with them, and he disappeared.<eos> We figured he either fled or he was dead.<eos> Well, what was the falling-out about?<eos> Could've made a grab for power, insulted somebody's girlfriend, or took the last stick of gum.<eos> All right, I'm gonna need photos and background files on all the gang leaders.<eos> - Yeah, no problem.
- Yeah, I do.<eos> - Then what's wrong with different?<eos> - Different is interesting, exciting. Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You can't walk into my place.<eos> - I just did.<eos> - I have rights.<eos> - Call the cops.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Your help.
He has to cooperate with us.<eos> - You gonna help him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I give you my word.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Okay.<eos> And then the next thing you got to do,<eos> - you got to call off your lawyer.<eos> - What lawyer?
I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Okay.<eos> And then the next thing you got to do,<eos> - you got to call off your lawyer.<eos> - What lawyer?<eos> When?<eos> All right.<eos> Lawyer convinced the judge that since there were no witnesses and we didn't find a murder weapon, Nicky may have just gotten caught in the crossfire.<eos> - Bail?<eos> - 100 grand.
- Hello!<eos> - Hello.<eos> What is that?<eos> This is my very own spa water.<eos> Cayenne, lemon, ginger, mint, and chia seeds.<eos> - Chia seeds as in chia pet? - Yes, actually.<eos> Wait, so if she drinks that, is she gonna grow one of those huge super-green afros?<eos> No, Jane. There'll be no growing of green afros.<eos> She'll be sufficiently hydrated with vitamins, and the chia seeds will provide Omega-3 and 6, - potassium, and antioxidants. - Hmm.<eos> Not even a little afro?
What'd you find out from o'Connell?<eos> That Alice knew how to keep her drug business completely buried.<eos> - We already knew that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did you get a list of her visitors while she was in jail?<eos> It's bizarre.<eos> She didn't have any.<eos> What?<eos> She was there for four years.<eos> Not one visitor.
- On my way.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Frankie.<eos> - Jane.<eos> I'm gonna take the samples back to Boston for analysis.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you there.<eos> - We need to take her alive.<eos> - No guarantees.
I brought a friend.<eos> I got scotch.<eos> Come on.<eos> One drink.<eos> I won't be long.<eos> I'm on the way to a wedding.<eos> Really?<eos> Who's getting married?<eos> I am.<eos> Well, good luck.
No, sir.<eos> Widen the search area.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Proceeding to quadrants C and D.<eos> Watch the hunting blinds.<eos> Mayor's citation for bravery.<eos> Medal of valor.<eos> Police officer of the year?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Lots of ribbons and plaques.
No, it's from the banks of the Charles River.<eos> When did you tell Alice about the family cabin?<eos> Was it a few months after you met her?<eos> Mm. I'll bet that you told her and then quickly, your relationship got physical, huh?<eos> You wanted Alice, she wanted the cabin.<eos> She used you just like she used Joe Harris.<eos> State troopers are at the cabin.<eos> Nobody's there, but it's fully stocked as if two people were gonna be there for a while.<eos> - Car.<eos> - No tracks.
He was visiting Alice.<eos> Do you know where we can find him?<eos> I do.<eos> "BCU ... a renowned institute of higher learning located by the beautiful Charles River.<eos> Where you can get a great education in an historic setting."<eos> And mud for your license plate.<eos> All right, look.<eos> We'll divide and conquer.<eos> Tonight.<eos> 7:00 at the Libes?
- Alice Sands' son?<eos> - That's a yes. - Hey!<eos> Hey! Take it easy.<eos> Eric Stone.<eos> Anthropology major.<eos> Dean's list.<eos> Service award.<eos> - Doesn't add up.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because of my mother?
Can we all just make sure that our cellphones are off?<eos> Thank you, Jane.<eos> Kiki.<eos> When I'm not with you, I will be waiting for you.<eos> You will always be in my life.<eos> Vince.<eos> How did I get so lucky?<eos> By the power vested in me by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I now pronounce you Vince and Kiki Korsak.<eos> - It's official!<eos> - Out of sin!
Kiki.<eos> When I'm not with you, I will be waiting for you.<eos> You will always be in my life.<eos> Vince.<eos> How did I get so lucky?<eos> By the power vested in me by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I now pronounce you Vince and Kiki Korsak.<eos> - It's official!<eos> - Out of sin!<eos> - So what do you think? - # for your love #<eos> - Slim pickings. - Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna give your advice back to you.<eos> Go for it.<eos> Call him back. Say yes.<eos> Say "oui."<eos> No.<eos> It appears the cause of death was traumatic limb loss.<eos> No!<eos> We're gonna need more evidence bags.<eos> Not a huge charge.<eos> Smaller than a grenade.
- I haven't ev...<eos> - Just stop.<eos> There's half a possum and another crater over there.<eos> We're standing in a minefield.<eos> Just don't move.<eos> Hello, detectives.<eos> Dr. Isles.<eos> Okay, Bryce, you going for, like, a pep-rally thing?<eos> 'Cause not peppy.<eos> Not peppy.
- Oh, don't worry about me, Jane.<eos> Kiki will be glad I missed a meal.<eos> - I've got something!<eos> - Hang on a second.<eos> Contact.<eos> We've got another device.<eos> Don't move until he's flagged it.<eos> We don't want any motion in the area while he's working.<eos> Mr. Park, how long have you and John been doing this work?<eos> 10 years.
- Apparently, this is close enough.<eos> - You look ridiculous.<eos> Shouldn't you be out catching a murderer?<eos> You want me to go back to work?<eos> You walk over here and make me.<eos> Apparently, our victim came up here a lot.<eos> So someone planted enough mines he'd step on one eventually.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - If you're patient, it's not a stupid way to murder someone.<eos> No stupider than any other way.
Yeah, everything's all right.<eos> Am I fine?<eos> Of course.<eos> But I'll ...<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Yeah, love you, too.<eos> It's a story best told in person.<eos> I also got a text from Nina.<eos> She found the hacker's cousin.<eos> Yeah. About an hour ago.
Her family controls a chain of budget motels across the country.<eos> - Company's valued around $1 billion.<eos> - Never heard of her.<eos> Yeah, I think that's how she likes it.<eos> She's a notoriously private person.<eos> Her online presence has been totally scrubbed.<eos> I was able to find one article that mentions her from Equatorial Guinea.<eos> It's a piece about the de-mining efforts in that region.<eos> And she just happens to be with our victim.<eos> - For 3 1/2 weeks.
- Helping you.<eos> No, Maura.<eos> Come on. It's late.<eos> - You don't have to do this.<eos> - Look, you're not the only one that this is happening to, all right?<eos> I want to find this name as badly as you do.<eos> So, just think of me as one more cactus on your ledge.<eos> Want some noodles?<eos> Sure.<eos> - Good night.
- You don't have to do this.<eos> - Look, you're not the only one that this is happening to, all right?<eos> I want to find this name as badly as you do.<eos> So, just think of me as one more cactus on your ledge.<eos> Want some noodles?<eos> Sure.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - What's this?<eos> Oh, uh, swatches.<eos> - For your reception. - Ahh.
- Said he had an epiphany.<eos> He wanted to get back to his roots,<eos> - in terms of his original vision.<eos> - So it wasn't an affair.<eos> Well, he was kind of cheating on his business partner.<eos> Yeah, he told the heiress that his partner, Park, was more interested in executive perks than in the mission itself.<eos> Our guy wanted to start over, downsize the administrative costs of the NGO.<eos> Oh. So bye-bye parties and photo ops.<eos> Guess what we just found at Walter Park's house.<eos> - Not Walter Park?
What happened to you?<eos> Did you step in some glass?<eos> Let me see.<eos> Hey.<eos> Officer Riske.<eos> What do you got?<eos> The female... is Nicole Brown Simpson.<eos> She's the property owner.<eos> The male is unidentified.<eos> Lot of blood.
She'll understand.<eos> And Gordon's lawyer called.<eos> He...<eos> I don't have time for this today.<eos> Got it.<eos> - Sorry. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Tell Gil I'll be right over.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> What time did he fly to Chicago?<eos> 11:45 p.m.
All that battering before he was even arrested.<eos> It's the LAPD and a famous guy.<eos> Marcia.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The tape is here.<eos> O.J., when was the last time you saw Nicole?<eos> Yesterday when we were leaving our daughter's dance recital.<eos> It ended at about, uh, 6:30, 6:45, something like that.<eos> And what time did you get back home?<eos> Oh, 7:00-something.
Do we have him?<eos> Yep.<eos> The DNA came through.<eos> The blood drops at Bundy are Simpson's type and the Rockingham glove matches a mix of Simpson and the victim's blood.<eos> Well, thank God.<eos> Let's put him behind bars.<eos> Tom, how long have you known me?<eos> Look, I know you have a warrant for his arrest, but there's no reason you have to come and get Mr. Simpson when I can bring him to you.<eos> And-and let's be clear:<eos> no perp walk here.
Oh, my God!<eos> It's A.C. Cowlings!<eos> Over here!<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> !<eos> It's him.<eos> It's freaking him.<eos> I told you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What?
If they say the sky is blue, hearsay.<eos> Nothing will be admitted without challenge and provocation.<eos> _<eos> Your Honor, at this time, the State requests a hair sample to compare to hairs found at the scene of the crime.<eos> Excuse me, Your Honor. We have some grave concerns about this request.<eos> We would ask that the court limit this sample to only the number of hairs required - for testing.<eos> - Ms. Clark, how much hair - do the People need?<eos> - Well, Your Honor, a typical sample, as I'm sure the defense is aware, takes hairs from each area of the head.<eos> Five to ten hairs per area, amounting to approximately 100 hairs.<eos> - 100 hairs?
It's only as many hairs as the criminalist needs, to compare hairs from the defendant with hairs found at the crime scene.<eos> 100 hairs seems unduly invasive.<eos> Your Honor, we offer one hair.<eos> - What?<eos> - Just a second,<eos> - Ms. Clark. - Excuse me,<eos> Your Honor, but this objection is beyond ridiculous.<eos> They seem to be on some kind of fishing expedition at my client's expense.<eos> Your Honor, this is routine.<eos> - 80 hairs.
Did you know Nicole had breast implants?<eos> It was O.J.'s idea, but I'll be honest with you, she loved them.<eos> What else can I tell you about Nicole?<eos> She loved to give a Brentwood Hello.<eos> I'm sorry, a "Brentwood Hello"?<eos> It was a little joke we had.<eos> Where she would go into... a guy's bedroom while he was asleep, and, you know... give... go down on him.<eos> Ha!<eos> Hmm, hmm, hmm... We are gonna sell a lot of books.<eos> In a very nonexploitive way, of course.
But I'm more worried about how it'll affect us later.<eos> Everybody.<eos> All of us. If I don't put a lid on Johnnie Cochran, this city is...<eos> Listen, let's just go away to Hawaii and have a beautiful weekend, okay?<eos> You're afraid there are gonna be more riots, aren't you?<eos> You got a minute?<eos> - I got all the time in the world.<eos> - Okay. Knock off the self-pity.<eos> I'm working on a really big case, - and we could use a little help.<eos> - Ah. What kind of help?
- Okay.<eos> This feels like the story of the year.<eos> We all agree the mug shot is our cover?<eos> But it'll be in every daily, so by the time we hit the stands, this shot will be old news.<eos> So we need to jazz it up; we need something dramatic.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, try something like noir, intrigue.<eos> I could add a bit of chiaroscuro.<eos> Heavy shadow.<eos> Like Rembrandt.
There's only one way to shut up Dershowitz.<eos> Hire him.<eos> Oh, trust me, it'll be better here.<eos> But he killed them five minutes from the Santa Monica courthouse.<eos> Yeah, I know, I know, but we can't ask them to move the trial to Santa Monica.<eos> And they're way behind fixing the earthquake damage, and the media room's dinky; it's downtown.<eos> There'll be room for everybody.<eos> That way, we can handle the press, we have our offices and resources down here.<eos> Plus, the optics are a million times better.<eos> The "optics"?
Okay.<eos> I'm not going to contest the DNA matches.<eos> I'm going to keep them out of court entirely.<eos> If it can be shown that there may have been errors in the collection or the handling of the samples used for the prosecution's DNA analysis, we can contest the validity of the evidence itself.<eos> At best, we get some of it thrown out, and at worst, we get the jury to question it, the very idea.<eos> We will attack every assumption, question every single molecule of evidence, every aspect of how that molecule was gathered, handled and analyzed.<eos> We will disrupt their presentation of physical evidence at every turn.<eos> We will hack at them.<eos> Make every piece of evidence presented either thrown out, untrustworthy or confusing.<eos> No quarter.
Bob, there's a reporter from the New Yorker Magazine here to see you.<eos> That on the schedule?<eos> No, he just showed up.<eos> Well, tell him it doesn't work that way.<eos> Tell him I'm very busy.<eos> Linda, I want to see him.<eos> Don't let him go.<eos> Thanks for taking the time to see me.<eos> Now, you're New York Magazine<eos> - or New Yorker?

"Massage it."<eos> Mr. Dunne, I've read some of your past coverage of murder trials in Vanity Fair magazine.<eos> I'm lucky I write for a magazine that allows me to take a stand, Your Honor.<eos> Well, there's no mistaking how you feel.<eos> No. That's something I'm proud about.<eos> I am, uh, assigning you a permanent seat in the front row.<eos> You'll be next to the Goldmans. And the seat is yours for the length of the trial.<eos> Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Without, uh, being too forward, I sense that you'll be able to sympathize with them in a way that the rest of us cannot, that you'll know how to deal with them, not intrude or ask inappropriate questions.<eos> Because of my daughter's murder?
I'm in a hurry. I'd like to do a few interviews.<eos> - With the black press.<eos> - Why? I think it's important that people understand<eos> - what my role is on this case and--<eos> - Is this about the poll?<eos> Marcia said there was some poll.<eos> - No one's doing press, Chris. If I had to respond every time some crab apple said something about me...<eos> You're just gonna do more harm drawing attention to yourself.<eos> D.A.s don't go on talk shows. It's a sensitive case.<eos> No press.
Ms. Clark, please remember your place in this courtroom.<eos> And it's not as an officer of the court.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yes.<eos> My apologies to the court, Your Honor.<eos> Counsel, continue.<eos> My client has more time than money.<eos> He is being reasonable.<eos> Rather than pay added child support to pay strangers to take care of the children...<eos> For God's sake!
Johnnie's associates will arrange a briefing for you every day.<eos> All right, okay, fine.<eos> Y'all go.<eos> I'm done with you.<eos> When I have pent-up anger, what I use is boxing...<eos> When I want to hear from you I'll rattle my zipper.<eos> Now get the hell out of here, Bob.<eos> What do you really want, Marcia?<eos> I'll do anything for you.<eos> Something different.
I'll do anything for you.<eos> Something different.<eos> Softer.<eos> I've never had to think about anything like this before, so...<eos> I'm a little nervous.<eos> The only thing you need to be is the best version of yourself.<eos> And that's what we're here to discover.<eos> I've got it.<eos> I did it for Farrah, and I'm gonna do it for you.<eos> Farrah?
"Visa card number two, 1989 to 1990."<eos> Okay.<eos> I give up.<eos> Nicole bought the gloves.<eos> - Our gloves.<eos> Aris Isotoner, model number 70263.<eos> In the United States, the only place that sold them was Bloomingdale's in New York.<eos> Of all the 70263's, only 300 pairs were extra large.<eos> Bloomingdale's sold 200 of those.<eos> On December 18, 1990,
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah, but they're not necessarily the gloves.<eos> Bobby, please, you have to help me talk again, to everyone, about a plea.<eos> If we go in there with this glove thing, they will absolutely kill us.<eos> And once it's done, we'll have no chance to cut a deal.<eos> Look, just talk to Johnnie, all right?<eos> I think making a deal is crazy.<eos> Bobby, there... the reason I'm talking to you is that you may have a personal stake in this.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, the bag.

For the sake of both of us, please don't continue to tell me any more.<eos> No, wait a minute.<eos> No...<eos> If you do have possession of the weapon, and you decided to suddenly turn it in, I don't know.<eos> I guess at most, it would be accessory after the fact.<eos> You'd get five years, out in two.<eos> Uh, but I don't know if we could convince them that you didn't know it was in the bag.<eos> I-I think that... I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But what the f...?

I'm<eos> I'm really struggling.<eos> I'm really struggling here, A.C.<eos> Even when it seems everybody else has stopped working to figure out who did it, I...<eos> I keep going over everything, again and again.<eos> Everything I know about Nicole, everything I can learn about Ron Goldman.<eos> I mean, there's never been more information, more-more media coverage, more detectives, more... even the kooks... all about one thing, one crime, ever.<eos> Ever!<eos> And there's... just... nothing.<eos> No other suspect?

Yes, sir.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Well, I am coming back here next weekend, with or without you.<eos> Well, my friends might prefer it that way.<eos> This is me.<eos> This... 311?<eos> Yeah, 311.<eos> Well...<eos> Good night.
Okay?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Do you think there's any way that these two gloves could not be a pair?<eos> I'd have to say it would be virtually impossible.<eos> All right, at this time, we will take a 15-minute recess.<eos> Hello, Mike.<eos> Bob.<eos> Are any of you interested in something other than a conspiracy theory?<eos> Some real, demonstrable evidence?<eos> A little bit of real lawyering?
Your Honor... sidebar.<eos> Counsel, approach the bench.<eos> Your Honor, I see where this is going, and I'm not having it.<eos> - And where is that, Counselor?<eos> There'll be no demonstrations involving my client.<eos> If Mr. Simpson chooses to testify, and we want to have him try on the actual gloves in evidence, that's one thing.<eos> Further, I submit the timing is inappropriate, Your Honor.<eos> Is that right, Johnnie?<eos> That's right.<eos> - For who?
Please leave your message, and we will return your call.<eos> Fred, uh, it's Chris Darden.<eos> I'm... sorry about what happened today.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> But it's not over yet.<eos> We'll come back from this.<eos> We will.<eos> Uh... okay.<eos> You know, call me any time.<eos> Bye.
We can't talk about this case.<eos> I don't know what you bitching and moaning about, Lionel.<eos> Everybody knows that you ain't got nothing going on in the real world no way.<eos> What did you say?<eos> !<eos> I will smack the taste out of your mouth.<eos> Please!<eos> Please, that's enough!<eos> Let's just settle down.<eos> For me.
Well, let's not get... too cocky.<eos> I mean, we haven't heard them.<eos> Look, lucky breaks don't just fall from the sky.<eos> Oh, yes, they do, Mr. Scheck.<eos> God brought us these tapes.<eos> There is something much larger at play here.<eos> This is manna from heaven.<eos> What is the defense doing?<eos> They got Ito to sign a subpoena for what?<eos> 13 hours of tape in North Carolina.
A hearing is scheduled for today and a ruling is expected soon on the highly controversial and incendiary tapes.<eos> Your Honor, this issue can be decided with dispatch.<eos> We will present portions of that transcript that are relevant to the credibility of Detective Fuhrman.<eos> 30 occasions in which he uses the word<eos> "nigger" in a racially offensive context and which directly contradict the testimony he presented under oath.<eos> And we will also present an additional 17 extracts where Detective Fuhrman speaks, with personal experience, about police misconduct, planting of evidence, commission of perjury, and the presentation of cover-ups and false testimony in court proceedings.<eos> This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do as a prosecutor.<eos> I don't want to be in the position of defending Mark Fuhrman.<eos> My job is to defend Ron and Nicole.<eos> The victims.
"National concern"?<eos> This is a double homicide,<eos> - Your Honor, not Iran-Contra!<eos> - Ms. Clark?<eos> The court in its wisdom has made a determination.<eos> Why do we have to broadcast this?<eos> Truth, Ms. Clark, the truth.<eos> The court hides nothing from the people.<eos> - The truth?<eos> - Nothing.
He didn't like that.<eos> He didn't like that. 'Cause he's a hardened racist.<eos> Mark Fuhrman is the one who said,<eos> "If I see an interracial couple, "I'm gonna stop them.<eos> "If I don't have a reason, I'm gonna make something up."<eos> So you have a lying Mark Fuhrman, the personification of evil, who found the gloves.<eos> But don't be fooled.<eos> This isn't just one officer.<eos> Mark Fuhrman represents the entire...<eos> LAPD.
Looked to me like O.J. was just trying to not make 'em fit.<eos> Why were they not inside out?<eos> That's how they would be if he take 'em off. Mm-hmm.<eos> Shouldn't there have been more blood around the glove they found at O.J.'s house?<eos> And wouldn't there be blood on the leaves?<eos> You can just ask Mark Fuhrman about that.<eos> There's too many mess-ups.<eos> Too much strange stuff going on in the thing.<eos> You will never convince me that he did it without a doubt.<eos> Beyond a reasonable doubt.
Is anybody nervous?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's a big day, huh, O.J.?<eos> The biggest.<eos> Hey, man, I just want you to know... Guarding you in here... It's been a pleasure.<eos> There's a lot of real assholes that come through this place and... you've always been a stand-up guy.<eos> Thanks, Eddie.<eos> Blade me.<eos> And, uh, I was hoping before we go in, that maybe you could sign this.<eos> For my kid.
Yeah, and you said there'd be no bloody uniforms.<eos> Nevertheless.<eos> Nevertheless, John.<eos> Despite the bad blood, I'll have none of it on my carpet.<eos> Now, for Grace's sake, nothing will go wrong.<eos> Those bastards out there are her family.<eos> And if you fuckers do anything to embarrass her, your kin, your cousins, your horses, your fucking kids, you do anything...<eos> Tom?<eos> - .. to...<eos> What?
And if you fuckers do anything to embarrass her, your kin, your cousins, your horses, your fucking kids, you do anything...<eos> Tom?<eos> - .. to...<eos> What?<eos> - What about snow?<eos> Yeah, their women are sports, I'll say that.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No cocaine.

No cocaine.<eos> No cocaine.<eos> No sport.<eos> No telling fortunes.<eos> No racing.<eos> No fucking sucking petrol out of their fucking cars.<eos> And you, Charlie, stop spinning yarns about me, eh?<eos> I'm just trying to sell you to them, Tom.<eos> But the main thing is, you bunch of fuckers, despite the provocation from the cavalry, no fighting!<eos> No fighting.

- I am Russian.<eos> - Same fucking thing.<eos> So you make contact on my wedding day.<eos> You now have very powerful enemies, at the Soviet Embassy and within your own government.<eos> You are being watched -- at your house, your office, your clubs, your bars.<eos> You best be quick or I'll be missed.<eos> Where's the money?<eos> The Duke's niece is bringing it from London.<eos> I was told money on contact.<eos> 10,000 in US dollars.
- Right, listen to me.<eos> Tell Johnny Dogs and his boys to light a fire in the woods.<eos> A big one, to take meat.<eos> Send Finn to watch the gates.<eos> Moss is bringing someone.<eos> You don't?<eos> I just needed to bring you somewhere nobody could see.<eos> But your friend gave this to me.<eos> He said you all did it.<eos> Not me.
What does that mean?<eos> It means yeah, we're a close family.<eos> Arthur?<eos> I do apologise for the interruption.<eos> There is a woman here to see you, Mr Kaledin.<eos> She just arrived.<eos> - So Tatiana made it from London safely?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - Out by the stables.
It was all part of a story.<eos> A story I was telling myself about who I was.<eos> A collection of lies that would disappear in the light.<eos> The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was.<eos> So what did you do?<eos> I left to go and find them.<eos> I didn't even put on my shoes.<eos> I walked out the door and never went back.<eos> Come, let's go and see him.<eos> - Who?
It's done.<eos> It's in the past.<eos> And of course<eos> Margaery's safety is paramount.<eos> You don't like Margaery, do you?<eos> Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant.<eos> Margaery is the queen.<eos> Queens must command respect.<eos> Kings even more so.<eos> Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's.
You hate what they've done to your son.<eos> Do you want Lancel back?<eos> Or have you given him up for good?<eos> Of course I want him back.<eos> Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.<eos> If it doesn't go as planned, the sparrows have many friends in this city.<eos> We'll have civil war.<eos> Many will die.<eos> Many will die no matter what we do.<eos> Better them than us.
No!<eos> No!<eos> It was you.<eos> You made the white walkers.<eos> We were at war.<eos> We were being slaughtered.<eos> Our sacred trees cut down.<eos> We needed to defend ourselves.<eos> From whom?<eos> From you.
No!<eos> It was you.<eos> You made the white walkers.<eos> We were at war.<eos> We were being slaughtered.<eos> Our sacred trees cut down.<eos> We needed to defend ourselves.<eos> From whom?<eos> From you.<eos> From men.
You pledged yourself to me.<eos> You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.<eos> Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world.<eos> I command you to heal yourself and then return to me.<eos> When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side.<eos> In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?<eos> None.<eos> And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men?<eos> Two, but that was the day of the pact.<eos> Since then, nothing.
And now she's devoted to the gods as well.<eos> Would you like to see her?<eos> Have they hurt you?<eos> Have they mistreated you?<eos> - No, Your Grace.<eos> - I've missed you.<eos> More than you could know.<eos> We'll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.<eos> Better how?<eos> Soon the... Walk of atonement.
I give you Bobono.<eos> I give you Camello.<eos> And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane.<eos> Give this a good beating.<eos> Shake those fleas out.<eos> That's a dear.<eos> That crowd was shit.<eos> Girl.<eos> What are you doing back here?<eos> Nothing.
And you will be ready.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> How many days' ride to Meereen?<eos> A week at best.<eos> How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?<eos> Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons... 1,000 ships easily.<eos> - Probably more.<eos> - And who has that many?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Nobody yet.
Oh, this is madness!<eos> You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear.<eos> All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about... - Grandmother.<eos> - ...until I tell them to stop.<eos> If I tell them to stop.<eos> - You could use a good bashing.<eos> - Grandmother, please.<eos> What have they done to you?<eos> You marched against the High Sparrow,<eos> - against the Faith.
You were born a fighter.<eos> You walked away from the fight.<eos> How did that go?<eos> Good and bad, young and old, the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike.<eos> You can still help a lot more than you've harmed, Clegane.<eos> It's not too late for you.<eos> Lady Crane?<eos> Lady Crane?<eos> If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly.<eos> Instead...
I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt.<eos> That is my plan.<eos> You don't approve?<eos> You once told me you knew what your father was.<eos> Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me.<eos> He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares.<eos> He would have burned every one of his citizens.<eos> The loyal ones and the traitors.
You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.<eos> Sleep well.<eos> She's a fine woman, your sister.<eos> I look forward to having her back in my bed.<eos> And you're all fine-looking men.<eos> My dogs are desperate to meet you.<eos> I haven't fed them for seven days.<eos> They're ravenous.<eos> I wonder which parts they'll try first.<eos> Your eyes?

Reasonable.<eos> What if everyone starts demanding their independence?<eos> She's not demanding, she's asking.<eos> The others are free to ask as well.<eos> Our fathers were evil men, all of us here.<eos> They left the world worse than they found it.<eos> We're not going to do that.<eos> We're going to leave the world better than we found it.<eos> You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.
Show me.<eos> Your Grace, there's no need--<eos> Show me.<eos> What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral?<eos> As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?<eos> He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister.<eos> Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> Hello.<eos> From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.<eos> Bay of Dragons?<eos> We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?<eos> You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it.<eos> I hope it brings you happiness.<eos> I pity the lords of Westeros.<eos> They have no idea what's coming for them.<eos> Farewell, Daario Naharis.<eos> How did he take it?<eos> No tears.
Too pretty.<eos> Where are my damn moron sons?<eos> Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.<eos> They're here, my lord.<eos> Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs?<eos> Tell them to come here now.<eos> But they're already here, my lord.<eos> Here, my lord.<eos> They weren't easy to carve.<eos> Especially Black Walder.
Is there a rule that says a girl can't run the Gauntlet?<eos> That's the way it's always been.<eos> We have female commanders in the Elvin army, and women on the High Council.<eos> It's time the Four Lands had a female Chosen.<eos> You knew about this?<eos> Who do you think sneaked her past the Home Guard and out of the palace?<eos> The Gauntlet is dangerous, Amberle.<eos> These guys will do anything to win.<eos> So will I.<eos> Then good luck.
So, uh, you live here alone?<eos> Don't worry, we won't be disturbed.<eos> Mmm.<eos> So aren't you worried about Rovers?<eos> What do you know about Rovers?<eos> One look at you and they'd take the clothes off your back and steal your little bag of blue rocks.<eos> I need those back.<eos> Why?<eos> Are they valuable?<eos> Only to me.
I dismissed it until I found this in her room.<eos> ♪♪<eos> Demons?<eos> She sketched them before the Druid showed up.<eos> It can't be a coincidence.<eos> Until we are certain, I want all the Chosen and the entire Elvin Council taken to the palace for safety.<eos> Black Watch will guard them night and day.<eos> My mentor told me that he hid the Codex in this chamber before the Keep fell.<eos> When was that?<eos> 300 years ago.
Excuse me?<eos> Why did the Druid pick you to protect me?<eos> No idea.<eos> Did you know your ears turn red when you lie?<eos> My last name is Ohmsford, but according to Allanon, I'm part of the Shannara bloodline.<eos> Wait, you're a Shannara?<eos> That's incredible.<eos> Every Elf knows the story of Jerle Shannara by heart, the great warrior king who united the Four Lands with his magic.<eos> Yeah, well, they didn't talk about that very much out in the Vale.<eos> - Not a lot of Elf fans out here.
Is this your usual grave look or should I be worried?<eos> She's losing the fight.<eos> (grunting, fighting)<eos> You neglected your oath while the world burned.<eos> You're no hero.<eos> The Ellcrys knows the truth.<eos> Congratulations, Amberle.<eos> You passed the test.<eos> Now, don't let anything distract you.<eos> Not fear. Not love.
Otherwise the three of you will not make it to Safehold.<eos> Move out!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Daddy's coming.<eos> Lorin, you're too slow.<eos> Come on, that's not fair.<eos> You cheated.<eos> Amberle, what is it?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.
I'm late for watch.<eos> And you're going to miss the Council meeting.<eos> But I leave for Tyrsis in the morning.<eos> Diana, this is our last chance to be together.<eos> For a month.<eos> You'll live.<eos> Yeah, but when I get back, I'll be a diplomat and you'll be a Captain.<eos> We won't have time to fool around.<eos> Regular power couple, huh?<eos> But until then,
I fight for freedom, not vanity, unlike you.<eos> You'll forgive me, but I...<eos> I don't respond to that sort of diplomacy.<eos> The time for diplomacy has passed.<eos> Now is the time for vengeance!<eos> If you truly care about your people, lay down your weapons.<eos> Help me end this war.<eos> We will spare your life.<eos> You have our word.<eos> Enough words.
Keeping him alive is a mistake.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But if so, it will be my mistake.<eos> Now stand down.<eos> We're not done, Rover.<eos> Aye-aye, Captain.<eos> You hear that?<eos> I don't hear anything.<eos> Exactly.<eos> No birds.
Come on.<eos> Move fast.<eos> Stick to dry land.<eos> Breathe as little as possible.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Get down!<eos> Told you I had a plan.<eos> Having second thoughts, Prince?<eos> And third and fourth ones.<eos> With good reason.
I've tried to get rid of that guy?<eos> He'll probably sail in here and save the day any minute.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And he was in your vision.<eos> I'm guessing your old tree has no reason to lie.<eos> What'd you see in there anyway? You never told me.<eos> I saw you and Wil.<eos> Standing in front of this incredible stained glass window.<eos> It was right after I...<eos> Right after what?
Honestly?<eos> It's not just guys.<eos> What?<eos> Afraid you'll like it?<eos> You and Cephalo deserve each other.<eos> That mark, what does it mean?<eos> I don't know, I've always had it.<eos> I guess it's just how my first owner kept track of his property.<eos> What was that?<eos> Nothing good.
Good girl.<eos> No, please...<eos> Come on, kid.<eos> That's it.<eos> For the forebrain.<eos> I stick it through the nostril and tap it in ever so gently with this.<eos> You can bear me a child, live as my wife.<eos> Just like Mag's mother.<eos> She was scared, too.<eos> But after a few taps, no more tears.
We blew that thing up!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Get Amberle out of here, now!<eos> We're not leaving you.<eos> I'll be right behind you.<eos> Go!<eos> Come on!<eos> What about the others?<eos> We'll send it back once we're on the other side.<eos> Ready?
Proposition... your help in exchange for your freedom.<eos> That mark, what does it mean?<eos> I don't know, I've always had it.<eos> Arion, my father, all gone.<eos> (Allanon) And now you are King.<eos> (crowd) All hail the King.<eos> - Now what?<eos> - Now we find Safehold.<eos> There has to be another way across.<eos> What about that?
Its like he's inside my head.<eos> Making me do things.<eos> Whatever that thing wants, you'll fight it, okay?<eos> And you'll win.<eos> What about what I want?<eos> What do you want?<eos> (gasping)<eos> What is it?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Ugh... uh, nothing.
You sent me to that thing.<eos> To my imprisonment.<eos> Demons may have killed my family, but you... you have taken everything else.<eos> Everything I have done, I have done for the safety of the Four Lands... and to protect you.<eos> You're nothing but an outcast from an Order of dead men.<eos> Maybe it's time you joined them.<eos> This is not you, Bandon.<eos> No, Allanon, this is me.<eos> Stronger than anyone could ever imagine.<eos> Stronger than you, even.
We're wasting our time here.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> You're gonna leave me here to be gutted by Trolls?<eos> As a matter of fact, I would.<eos> You deserve to die alone in a cage like the dirty animal you are.<eos> Harsh.<eos> You cut the line at Pykon.<eos> You left us to die!<eos> It looks like you made out okay.<eos> No thanks to you.
You'll laugh.<eos> I won't.<eos> It's my destiny.<eos> Well, your "destiny" sounds a lot like slavery to me, Eretria.<eos> Your friends want you on their quest.<eos> I want you here.<eos> But all that matters...<eos> What is it you want?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.
Now, why don't you fill your boyfriend in while I go get the map?<eos> I'll meet you outside in five minutes.<eos> And if we refuse to leave?<eos> Then I'll tell every Human in here about you.<eos> And your pointy ears.<eos> - You didn't tell me about a map.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> In all the insanity, I must have forgot.<eos> Is that why you were so desperate to find her?<eos> Because of this map?
I got 'em right in my pocket.<eos> With these, you could get rid of the Elves, once and for all.<eos> Nice try.<eos> What?<eos> Look, the kid must still have 'em.<eos> He switched them on me!<eos> I swear, Check his pockets.<eos> I swear!<eos> Have a nice life, Rover.<eos> Well, for the next 20 seconds anyway.
No, we're gonna go out on the terrace where we can hear better.<eos> Do what you want, but I will not compromise my morals for some cheap thrill.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> She thinks he's having an affair!<eos> I don't care.<eos> With his slutty secretary.<eos> Not interested.<eos> Who's also her cousin!<eos> Damn it!<eos> And what about the office Christmas party?
The crunch of yesterday's biscotti almost gave us away.<eos> I'm lighting a cigarette, Linda.<eos> Aren't you gonna tear me a new one?<eos> No, Frank, I'm not.<eos> I've been thinking and, well, things between us have gotten a little overheated.<eos> That doesn't sound like Linda.<eos> What's she up to?<eos> Who knows?<eos> You know, relationships are a lot like laundry.<eos> What?
-Oh. -Hey, it's me! It's me, it's me.<eos> -What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> -It's me.<eos> - What?<eos> - You scared the shit out of me.<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry, all right?<eos> Don't freak out.<eos> I can't stand it when you do that!<eos> Hey, so when is your dad's birthday again?<eos> Uh, November 9th.
That's what I want, I want you to fucking die.<eos> It's over.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> - What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - We just gotta go quicker.<eos> Why?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> -My mom's here.<eos> -What the fuck?
Uh, why does everyone else get a CGI wolf?<eos> Why the fuck do we have a real wolf here?<eos> Arya, hey.<eos> False alarm.<eos> It's gonna be about 50 more minutes.<eos> And then, we'll take it to class.<eos> I can't.<eos> I need a nap.<eos> Nope.<eos> No naps today.
I guess she fell in the shower and the water kept running on her body for, like, a week, so when they found her, the bathtub was full of mush.<eos> Jesus! What...<eos> What?<eos> I told you not to give details.<eos> Yeah, well, you're the one who gave me the details.<eos> She lived here for 42 years, man.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How long have you guys lived here?<eos> Eighteen years.
I am a fuck-up.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> But I refuse to believe that all those dipshits I went to high school with, who are married now and putting pictures on Facebook every day of their kids in little headbands have it all figured out, right?<eos> That's gotta be bullshit.<eos> That can't be the deal.<eos> That can't be it.<eos> I know it's, like, not appropriate to be standing up here in a bathing suit... but I took an Ambien tonight.<eos> I... I was supposed to go to sleep, but then he called me to come here.<eos> -I'm really sorry.<eos> -Okay... okay.
- You're sure?<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 'Cause otherwise, it's not really, like, a threesome.<eos> It's more like, you know, two adjacent twosomes or...<eos> -Nah. It's not our thing.<eos> -No?<eos> Oh, I see, it's sort of, like, um, I'm like the conduit.<eos> We're sisters.<eos> What the fuck?
You have our robes.<eos> You're wearing our robes!<eos> Why are you wearing our robes?<eos> He doesn't have to answer your questions.<eos> Anyway, who are you?<eos> Many years ago, I was cursed.<eos> Trapped in this cursed state.<eos> Cursed to wander the far lands.<eos> Cursed... or "cur-sed."<eos> No comrades, no master.
Don't you touch him, you witch!<eos> And then there's you!<eos> The thieving insect who stole my sister's soul.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, this is precious.<eos> You've been together all this time and you haven't even realized?<eos> You took her from us.<eos> It was only fitting we took something from you.<eos> How swiftly those memories spilled from your head, wiping out all recollection of your obscene union...<eos> Hanzo.
Oh no...<eos> I'm sorry, young man.<eos> I seem to have forgotten my story.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> No, we'll all tell him.<eos> We'll tell him everything he needs to know.<eos> You are the kindest, sweetest man to ever live in this village.<eos> - Uh, uh... every day, you walk around smiling and handing out coins to children.<eos> Like me!
Admiring our philanthropy?<eos> They see our chunk and then they pony up.<eos> I mean, 10's barely gonna get us the roof.<eos> Wait, who's doing this roof?<eos> Michelangelo?<eos> Look, we agreed to 20. I'm asking you for half.<eos> Can you just cut the goddamn check?<eos> You know what? Why don't we get somebody to play at the thing?<eos> Free entertainment.<eos> Somebody like Dr. Hook. Somebody good.
If that little twat signs Alice Cooper, I'm gonna kill myself.<eos> Get in there.<eos> The man with the golden ear.<eos> Maury.<eos> Mr. Galasso.<eos> What a nice surprise.<eos> You want...<eos> Could you not?<eos> Get you a drink? - I'm good.<eos> - A little schnapps, please.
For example, when Ulysses arrives on the island of Calypso<eos> Exhausted after a shipwreck, the nymph Calypso, She was not just pretty, no...<eos> Marcos, who you think is the most beautiful woman?<eos> You.<eos> It's not worth it because I am the teacher<eos> And it's inappropriate that teachers have sex with their students.<eos> OK? Give me another one.<eos> Kim Basinger.<eos> Very cute.<eos> Much prettier than me, too.
That wasn't life.<eos> Marian called me to say that you had left, That you were waiting for the bus, but I wasn't sure it was you.<eos> She said you were with a woman.<eos> Ava, I think.<eos> She's an old friend.<eos> You will meet her.<eos> She's an artist, like you.<eos> I'm not an artist.<eos> I teach classical literature.<eos> And now, not even that.
The colour of the rocks by the lighthouse.<eos> You're so clever!<eos> I try to keep my sculptures compact,<eos> So the wind can't blow them away, like the people here.<eos> The people here are very tough.<eos> I visited Ava a lot, I liked watching her working and smoking.<eos> And she liked me to tell mythological histories,<eos> Like you, when you were little.<eos> The gods created man and other beings<eos> Out of clay and fire.
A few months after the birth, we took you to your grandparents,<eos> So they met you and Xoan.<eos> Two years later, I went back to see them.<eos> Your grandfather had taken early retirement.<eos> He had been the village teacher and had left to become a farmer.<eos> He had sold the house I had grown up in,<eos> And bought another in the country.<eos> Look, there they are.<eos> Do you need anything else?<eos> - No, nothing else.
Awful...<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> Come. Chubby!<eos> My father was having an affair with the girl who takes care of my mother.<eos> Your mother knows?<eos> My mother is past it, the poor thing, locked in her room...<eos> What's that?<eos> A tattoo.<eos> AJ?<eos> A for Antia and J for Juliet?
What if I get ill?<eos> Don't blackmail me, please!<eos> Of course not, honey.<eos> I have work and I need to get my notes in order.<eos> Maybe I'll put them in a book.<eos> I'll be busy.<eos> That's good.<eos> Let me walk you to the station.<eos> Remember that you don't like goodbyes.<eos> Well, goodbye.
I will not speak, I will think of nothing<eos> Infinite love will awaken in me<eos> I will go far far away<eos> As a wanderer, happy as a woman in nature<eos> Thank you, Damien.<eos> Rimbaud teaches us here...<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Had Good day?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And you?

We had nothing else.<eos> It can backfire.<eos> - He wants to be a veterinarian.<eos> Funny, I come from the countryside.<eos> My parents were farmers.<eos> Grain, no cattle like you.<eos> Niel allergic to penicillin?<eos> - No.<eos> If you come from here?<eos> - No, from the Beauce.
D is equal to B2... Minus 4ac.<eos> Ready.<eos> You're dumber than I thought.<eos> Two tasks. Determine the intersection points with the x-axis, and then both of ordinates.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Working.<eos> What is this, Damien?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What is this?<eos> Nothing.
What is wrong with you?<eos> What is this?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I tripped.<eos> - Stumbled?<eos> Do you think I had to kick?<eos> Damien has certainly done nothing?<eos> And you're just stumbled?<eos> And?<eos> Nothing.
Give your lessons me?<eos> - Toe say, with this snow?<eos> The next time.<eos> Paulo wants to buy your car.<eos> - That is not for sale.<eos> We're going Paulo say hello.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hello, Tom.<eos> I'm Damien's father.<eos> Everything good?
In your dream.<eos> Learning prefer harder instead of hanging out in the woods.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Tom, pack the honey?<eos> When you stay will'm doing good. Thanks.<eos> No thanks.<eos> You do not seem very enthusiastic.<eos> - Why should I live with you?<eos> A private room.<eos> Near school and hospital.

Thanks.<eos> No thanks.<eos> You do not seem very enthusiastic.<eos> - Why should I live with you?<eos> A private room.<eos> Near school and hospital.<eos> Ideal for learning.
- He is for you.<eos> Really?<eos> Cool, thanks.<eos> Has he been through war?<eos> - Wait...<eos> Given the stench...<eos> Goor.<eos> Tell me aaa.<eos> Looks good.<eos> Other side.
Do you know that?<eos> - Me too cold.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I was to my father.<eos> - I to Paulo.<eos> Not very muscular for all that training.<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> I defeat you still arm wrestling.<eos> - I do not think so.<eos> Ready?
- You, he's strong.<eos> What's for dinner? "<eos> - No idea.<eos> I waited for you.<eos> Then I'm going to make pasta.<eos> Was it planned that your husband so quickly had to leave again?<eos> No, but a phone call and he's gone within 24 hours.<eos> The army goes.<eos> How long?<eos> - A small four months.
I'm hungry.<eos> Not you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you not told where we were.<eos> It was not easy.<eos> She asked on.<eos> - She always wants to know everything.<eos> But she does not know everything.<eos> Nobody knows anything.<eos> Only you.

Inside.<eos> I should not have to ask him at home.<eos> You have not defended you, I heard.<eos> Why he slapped so hard?<eos> I tried to kiss him.<eos> Do you say nothing?<eos> No, I'm listening.<eos> What should I say?<eos> The sheep are upstairs.<eos> - Just out of school?
The Khan will see you now.<eos> Lord Ahmad, you called for me?<eos> Prince Nayan of Manchuria, this lovely creature is Ling, daughter of the former Emperor Duzhong of China.<eos> I have met great sultanas and Persian queens, and you, little one, have the bearing of a princess.<eos> Ling, these great men have traveled far.<eos> - Will you play for them while they wait?<eos> - Of course, Lord Ahmad.<eos> A warrior pope.<eos> He wielded no weapon.<eos> Merely the word of Christ.
I am tremendously drunk.<eos> You hide it well.<eos> Do I?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Still, I speak the truth when I say that I will protect you... in this life, and for many years to come.<eos> And I will honor you, not only as Imperial Lady, but... as friend... and a most excellent rider.<eos> I will be a faithful and devoted wife.<eos> And now...<eos> I give your gift.<eos> Early.
To make life better.<eos> Becca:<eos> How would you do that?<eos> By fixing the root problem.<eos> Waah!<eos> By fixing the root problem.<eos> By fixing the root problem.<eos> Rebecca:<eos> What is the root problem, A.L.I.E.?<eos> Too many people.

86 days, on my, um, last box of food, so... really never thought I'd miss the ark this much, but anyway, Jaha, if you're seeing this, that would indeed mean you're not dead,<eos> so screw you!<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I... mm...<eos> Voice: Containment door released.<eos> Wait!<eos> Get back here.<eos> Uh!<eos> Uh!<eos> Jaha:
No way.<eos> If you're gonna ride shotgun, you can't just disappear.<eos> Hey, it's ok.<eos> It's a long ride.<eos> Tracking beacon from the ark.<eos> Hey, that was the best part.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Farm station.<eos> What?<eos> After... after 4 months?
Azgeda stretches for a thousand miles.<eos> Good thing we only have to go 200 meters.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Remember, rules of engagement are nonlethal force.<eos> Tight formation on my command.<eos> - Raven, you stay in the rover.<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> We need every gun we've got.<eos> Monty: They're coming.<eos> 120 meters... 110.
I'll be in there in a minute.<eos> Abby, we have 12 patients waiting, including 4 contraceptive implant removals.<eos> You'll be right in.<eos> Abby, he had a knife to his throat, and he smiled.<eos> I want to talk about you, Raven.<eos> How's your hip?<eos> You don't have a broken compressor, do you?<eos> When did the pain start?<eos> After the explosion at the dam.<eos> 3 months.
Of course you do, more food for the sea monster, right?<eos> Let me prove to you what we can do.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I've seen what she can do.<eos> No.<eos> You haven't, not even close, son.<eos> Now, how is it possible you sound even Crazier than before?<eos> I can tell you about the city of light, but you won't understand until you experience it yourself.<eos> And that's supposed to take me to the city of light?<eos> No pain, no hate, no envy.
Hey, be gentle on him, brother.<eos> He's got a really complicated thing with his mom.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Ow.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry, but that flower crown is corny as hell.<eos> Mom, no one asked you.<eos> You have a beautiful forehead.<eos> Please do not cover it.<eos> And why do you want to look like the Statue of Liberty in all your wedding<eos> - pictures?
Please do not cover it.<eos> And why do you want to look like the Statue of Liberty in all your wedding<eos> - pictures?<eos> - No, Mom, it's super modern.<eos> Bill de Blasio's daughter wears one all the time.<eos> Ah, Bebe, that pin literally went through my skull.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> - Marnie keep it classic, please.<eos> - Yes, Mom.
Let's ditch this pisshole!<eos> I got a fuckin' woman to marry!<eos> Okay, but...<eos> Desi?<eos> Hold.. h-hold on one second, though.<eos> I think I just need to powder you and we're good.<eos> Uh, I think it's a little heavy.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, honey, this is the exact right look for this dress.<eos> You see, your dress is light, so we gotta weigh it down on the face.<eos> - Even the lips?
No, I think you should start as you mean to go on.<eos> Duty before pleasure.<eos> Don't you think it'll do us good to spend a little time apart?<eos> If you say so.<eos> Don't they say that absence sharpens the appetite?<eos> Mine doesn't really need any sharpening, Helene.<eos> You are a wicked, wicked man!<eos> What is it, Papa?<eos> Is it from Nikolai?<eos> Yes, dear Nikki...
Close the door, Petya!<eos> Come out, Nikki, I want to talk to you!<eos> All right!<eos> I wanted to talk to you. About Sonya.<eos> What about her?<eos> How do you really feel about her?<eos> Is she the only one for you?<eos> Why do you ask that now?<eos> Because it's very important.<eos> For her, if not for you.
Let's have a drink!<eos> Helene!<eos> I just want to say thank you for making poor Dolokhov so welcome.<eos> Oh, Pierre.<eos> - What? - Can't you see he's making a fool out of you?<eos> Hell of a woman, that.<eos> You think so?<eos> Yes...<eos> Yes, she is, isn't she?<eos> For the Master.
Courage, mon ange! No!<eos> Can it be, so soon?<eos> But surely it's just a stomach ache?<eos> It's best to be on the safe side, ma cherie.<eos> When did this come?<eos> - Just now, your Excellency.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> "Perhaps you should get some new spectacles, Count Bezukhov, then you might see what everyone sees but you... your wife's affair with Dolokhov."<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Nothing.
Let's just get a good night's sleep.<eos> That's a good idea. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> You hear that, that chirping sound?<eos> I did not, no.<eos> Probably a smoke detector or something like that, huh?<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> No big deal.
Remember what Father Tom says?<eos> We're supposed to pray to God.<eos> I'd rather talk to Daddy.<eos> But he never answers.<eos> The people we help, their mommies and daddies in heaven talk to them.<eos> Why doesn't Daddy talk to us?<eos> Just because you can't hear him doesn't mean he isn't there.<eos> What is it?<eos> Just saying goodnight.<eos> Goodnight.
Why can't one of us just go on it?<eos> There's so many things that prevent us.<eos> I'm with Betty on it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I don't see why not.<eos> Yeah, but just, they put the big helmets on...<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> Whatever.<eos> The whole thing is a myth.<eos> Well, no.
Never play alone.<eos> Never play in a graveyard.<eos> Always say goodbye.<eos> Circle once for each player.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> As friends we gather, hearts are true.<eos> Spirits near, we call to you.<eos> Is there a spirit here?<eos> Oh, my God.

Is there a spirit here?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Relax, Betty.<eos> Are you in the room with us?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Ellie, are you doing that?<eos> No, I swear.<eos> Ask your questions.<eos> What's it like on the other side?<eos> Oh, my God.
You should consider adding one to the act.<eos> ...soil is brought back to the Earth, eight guest scientists will join 14 others at the Ames Research Center near San Francisco to analyze it for evidence of life...<eos> Honey, please sit with us.<eos> Just once I want to have a normal family breakfast.<eos> Urn, actually, I'm gonna be late this morning, so I'm gonna walk.<eos> Don't be silly, have some food.<eos> I'll drop you off.<eos> No, it's cool.<eos> I'm walking with a friend.<eos> Who?
Are you there?<eos> Hi, friend.<eos> Now what?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Cut it out, Doris.<eos> Doris? Doris?<eos> This is a little awkward, but I had to ask you because it just seemed...<eos> Well, so unusual.<eos> Have you been helping Doris with her homework?<eos> Oh, God. Uh...
I should tell him.<eos> As friends we've gathered, hearts are true.<eos> Spirits near, we call to you.<eos> Daddy...<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> We might have to move out of our house.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> It's not right.<eos> This was your dad's house.<eos> Our house.
Daddy...<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> We might have to move out of our house.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> It's not right.<eos> This was your dad's house.<eos> Our house.<eos> And this is where he wanted us to live.<eos> If there's any part of him left, it's here.<eos> In these walls.
Go.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> Oh, no, not at all.<eos> Please.<eos> This is lovely.<eos> I've been by it so many times but I've never come inside.<eos> Well, I thought you could use a night away from cooking.<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> Some nights I'm so frazzled, I don't even bother to heat up the SpaghettiOs.<eos> Oh, God.
You're absolutely right.<eos> Some nights I'm so frazzled, I don't even bother to heat up the SpaghettiOs.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Please forget that.<eos> I'm really not a bad mother.<eos> Oh, I have cold SpaghettiOs twice a week.<eos> Twice a week at least.<eos> I keep a case at the rectory.<eos> Actually, I invited you here because I wanted to discuss the girls and home.<eos> Out of their earshot.
I keep a case at the rectory.<eos> Actually, I invited you here because I wanted to discuss the girls and home.<eos> Out of their earshot.<eos> I won't have it, Lizzie.<eos> I'll die first.<eos> Hey, come on in.<eos> Hey.<eos> But I don't have to die, do I?<eos> Oh, hello, kiddo.<eos> Hey, thanks for...
Sorry, my dad's an architect.<eos> His idea of a good time is driving me and my brother around and looking at houses.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm really glad you're not moving.<eos> My mom's gonna be home soon.<eos> I thought you said another hour.<eos> I'm not taking any chances.<eos> She'll seriously kill you.<eos> And me.
My mom's gonna be home soon.<eos> I thought you said another hour.<eos> I'm not taking any chances.<eos> She'll seriously kill you.<eos> And me.<eos> Romeo and Juliet.<eos> More like Bonnie and Clyde.<eos> Sadly, for us.<eos> Well...<eos> Goodnight. Goodnight.
Do you know what it feels like to be strangled to death?<eos> First, you feel the pressure in your throat.<eos> Your eyes water and you start to taste something very, very sour in your mouth.<eos> Then, it's like someone lights a match right in the middle of your chest.<eos> And that fire grows.<eos> It fills your lungs and your throat, and all the way behind your eyes.<eos> And finally that fire turns to ice, like pins and needles of ice are sticking into your fingers, your toes, your arms.<eos> You see stars, then darkness.<eos> And the last thing you feel, is cold.<eos> Goodnight, Romeo.
My wife's middle name was Catherine.<eos> I'm sorry, I...<eos> Is this about your reading?<eos> My mother's middle name was Lynn.<eos> Did you see her writing these?<eos> Actually writing them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Right over there.<eos> Sometimes the medium gets confused.<eos> Different voices...
I found a hole in the wall behind the furnace, and the money was inside.<eos> It was old and dusty.<eos> I think there's more.<eos> And it talks about a doctor at the camps.<eos> They called him the Devil's Doctor because of his interest in the occult and the experiments he'd conduct on the patients.<eos> He talks about being rescued by the Allies.<eos> He came to America and lived on the streets, ended up in a mental hospital.<eos> I found some jewelry in there, too.<eos> But I put it back.<eos> For later.
We have to find your sister.<eos> What's that?<eos> The basement.<eos> Lina, wait outside.<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> No, that's my sister.<eos> This is my house, and I'm going with you.<eos> Besides, splitting up sounds like the stupidest idea in the world.<eos> Okay, then.
He lives in the dark and the cold and he screams and screams and...<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Lina?<eos> I'm sorry, Doris.<eos> Daddy.<eos> Doris? Doris?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> No. No.<eos> Oh, God. Oh, God.
Mom!<eos> Mom. Mom.<eos> It wasn't you. Wasn't you.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Doris?<eos> Everybody's waiting.<eos> No, I'm sorry!<eos> Oh, God!
Doris?<eos> Everybody's waiting.<eos> No, I'm sorry!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Hey, Lina.<eos> Lina?<eos> Lina.<eos> Where did you go just now?<eos> What were we talking about?<eos> Your sister.
Oh, God!<eos> Hey, Lina.<eos> Lina?<eos> Lina.<eos> Where did you go just now?<eos> What were we talking about?<eos> Your sister.<eos> Again.<eos> Right. Right.<eos> What about her?
- because we asked...<eos> - Asked nicely.<eos> that he remove that rusting car and rotting sofa from his yard.<eos> Well, first of all, Yanis isn't Turkish.<eos> He's Greek or Albanian or something, and that's a Ford Fairlane he's trying to fix up.<eos> What is going on?<eos> They want Yanis to clean up his yard.<eos> And stop the motorcycle noise.<eos> They have a petition they want us to sign.<eos> - A what?
It's possible to make contrived functions f(x), for which no such polynomial exists, but these rarely occur in practice.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Gallagher.<eos> Now... who knows what Mr. Gallagher almost got to?<eos> A Chebyshev polynomial approximation?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I bought some fancy empty bottles from the bartender at The James.<eos> These idiots put so much fruit and coffee and crap into their cocktails, I can serve them jet fuel.<eos> They'd never know the difference.<eos> Hi, uh, appletini.<eos> No pussy drinks.
- Did you fuck her?<eos> Shit!<eos> Stop!<eos> Fucking stop!<eos> Shit!<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Stay away from her!<eos> You stay the fuck away from her!<eos> Stay away from who?<eos> From her!
Shit!<eos> Stop!<eos> Fucking stop!<eos> Shit!<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Stay away from her!<eos> You stay the fuck away from her!<eos> Stay away from who?<eos> From her!<eos> From Helene!
Stop!<eos> Fucking stop!<eos> Shit!<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Stay away from her!<eos> You stay the fuck away from her!<eos> Stay away from who?<eos> From her!<eos> From Helene!<eos> From my mom?
You loved that, didn't you?<eos> My God, I love you.<eos> What?<eos> You crazy kook.<eos> You're gonna get us in trouble.<eos> All right, all right, all right, all right.<eos> You keep quiet, okay?<eos> No yelling or anything like that.<eos> I love how lusty you are.<eos> You ready?
Fiona!<eos> What?<eos> Stop yelling.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Are you Fiona?<eos> Yup.<eos> We're Derek's parents.<eos> Debbie's friend Derek.<eos> We'd like to talk to you about the baby.<eos> What baby?
So, it's bay six.<eos> What is?<eos> Give me the keys to bay six.<eos> It's just old stock in storage.<eos> Give me the keys to bay six.<eos> For your trouble.<eos> Give it to your charity...<eos> I'm only doing this for the safety of my family.<eos> So, will it be just boys in your charitable institution or girls, as well?<eos> Both.
Yeah.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> Come here, Charlie.<eos> Charlie.<eos> This big man and his brother are going to make us a lot of money.<eos> Or lose us a lot of money.<eos> Who cares when they're such beautiful beasts, eh?<eos> You've got a house, John.<eos> Oh, fuck...<eos> Full of kids.
Now, how would that look, eh?<eos> Ah, now the party has really started.<eos> Who are they?<eos> Father John Hughes from St Mary's Boys Reformatory.<eos> And with him is Patrick Jarvis MP.<eos> They are part of an organisation called the Economic League.<eos> Did you invite them, Grace?<eos> The names sound familiar.<eos> They were recommended by the Lord Mayor.<eos> Oh. On your "best people of the city" list, eh?
(EXHALES) just do what's on the list, nothing else.<eos> Then burn it. Don't speak on the phones.<eos> The fucking Secret Service is listening.<eos> I want the old man alive.<eos> I wanna do it myself.<eos> That's it. (CLEARS THROAT) You can go.<eos> Come, john.<eos> Tommy, if you haven't got a bird here, you're gonna have to tell us something.<eos> Ask Polly.<eos> Not Michael?

- Not Michael, no? - No.<eos> Not Michael, no. 'Cause Michael deals with legitimate business.<eos> You saw him before us.<eos> John, not now.<eos> Wait, what did you say?<eos> You saw Michael before us!<eos> Fuck's sake, john.<eos> Because legitimate business, john, is the priority.<eos> - Legitimate business...<eos> - Since when?
Look, Polly, my motivation for doing this is twofold.<eos> Firstly, you have a face full of contradictions, and it's a challenge to capture them in one expression. -(SCOFFS)<eos> - That's the sales pitch.<eos> The second motivation is that I am planning to seduce you eventually and, please God, sleep with you.<eos> How would that please God?<eos> Please me.<eos> And stop.<eos> And he didn't say what he wants.<eos> When he was drunk, he said absolution.<eos> Other than that, nothing.
Look, we're disobeying Tommy's orders just by talking to you.<eos> Don't push it, please.<eos> - Come with us. Let him go. - AUDREY:<eos> Let him go, too.<eos> Say it's done.<eos> Say he's in the harbour.<eos> He can do you no harm from New York.<eos> I can't do that, Mrs Changretta.<eos> I can't do that. Sorry.<eos> OK, OK.
I need to know the name of the person in the organisation that was giving you information.<eos> What organisation?<eos> The Economic League, the Vigilance Committee, the Odd Fellows, Section D.<eos> They have many fucking names.<eos> Shit, shit, shit.<eos> Give me the name of the informant.<eos> Mr Shelby, they are very, very dangerous people.<eos> Well, fortunately, so are we.<eos> You have to choose who you're more afraid of.<eos> The Peaky Blinders at exactly 11:43, or Section D at some point in the future.
(Fuck it.)<eos> I'm not in the mood today.<eos> - Let's go to the Bull Ring.<eos> - Hallelujah!<eos> The foolish man?<eos> Not quite.<eos> I'm sorry I came unannounced.<eos> What do you want?<eos> We need proof.<eos> Proof of what?
As a duchess, I can show you what is possible for a man like you.<eos> A man in a house like this.<eos> Right now, you hide inside it like a boy who's broken in through the window.<eos> Why do we come to a bedroom for this?<eos> In your own house?<eos> It's a loaded fucking weapon.<eos> We could fuck by the fire with the maids standing to attention and watching.<eos> - What can they do?<eos> - Give it here.<eos> Nothing.
We could fuck by the fire with the maids standing to attention and watching.<eos> - What can they do?<eos> - Give it here.<eos> Nothing.<eos> There are no rules for you.<eos> Give me the fucking gun.<eos> You have maids here.<eos> You can bring a maid into the room.<eos> What can I do about that?<eos> Nothing.
You know, there's a general lack of discipline in this fucking company!<eos> She stayed the night.<eos> I'm working, Pol.<eos> I am working... for the good of the company.<eos> You're grieving.<eos> And when you grieve, you make bad choices.<eos> I know.<eos> I did it myself.<eos> Look, no more marches.<eos> No more fucking politics.
And Arthur believes, when this business is done, it'll all be over.<eos> Arthur believes you, but I don't.<eos> Linda, the people who have hired us to rob the factory are very bad people...<eos> They'll not pay us as they have promised.<eos> So, on the night of the robbery, we will take what's ours - from their treasury.<eos> - And a bit more on top for luck?<eos> If you're saying you're going to stop Arthur, I need to know.<eos> That'll be Arthur's decision.<eos> And your plan is still to reform him, eh?<eos> - To the absolute degree of redemption! - Mm-hm.
I haven't written it down.<eos> Linda, are you saying... .. if it WERE £41,000...<eos> I've already told you, that'll be Arthur's decision.<eos> But I don't imagine he'll accept less than 41.<eos> - May I smoke?<eos> - No.<eos> So, I imagine you have some plans for your 41,000?<eos> Yes.<eos> California.<eos> For the child's health.

Father Hughes, I am heartily sorry for having offended you... .. because of your just punishment, but most of all because they offend you.<eos> Father Hughes, who is all good and deserving of my love... .. I firmly resolve to...<eos> .. with the help of your grace, to sin no more and to avoid all near occasions of sin.<eos> Very good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Amen.<eos> And now that we are a united band once more, perhaps we could order some food?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm not feeling well.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Goodnight.
- You made a deal with our enemies.<eos> - I will do what needs to be done.<eos> You went behind our backs to stop the Soviets from blowing up the train.<eos> But it's all right. It's all right.<eos> We've rectified your mistake.<eos> You ask me, "What do I need to do?"<eos> Well, here is what you need to do you fucking mongrel, ya...<eos> Since the Bolsheviks will not be blowing up the train, you'll blow up the train yourself.<eos> It has always been about the explosion.<eos> From the beginning.
Tommy, listen.<eos> Your wife, Arthur?<eos> I am going to tell myself that you're, er... you're not thinking straight.<eos> Your mind is not clear.<eos> Or Esme getting cash for cocaine, eh, John?<eos> Fuck!<eos> All of a sudden, back in the family, Ada.<eos> Eh?<eos> That's a surprise.<eos> Out of the blue.
I need 50 sticks of BSA dynamite, 300 yards of cable and six detonators by midday tomorrow.<eos> This is evidence, I need you to scatter it.<eos> We're blowing up a train, people are going to die.<eos> Ruben and I talked about many things.<eos> But not that.<eos> Not ever.<eos> Tommy. I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> We looked everywhere.<eos> All the way to Hay Mills.<eos> So, nothing.
Apology accepted.<eos> Esme, I doubted you, as well.<eos> Now, John's got innocent lives on his conscience.<eos> - Ordinary working men...<eos> - Yeah, all right, Esme.<eos> Got it...<eos> No, she's right.<eos> And you and Arthur are going to have to share that burden.<eos> But, I hope the house that you could buy with this can become a place of... .. contemplation.<eos> Perhaps redemption.
- What?<eos> !<eos> Tell me, eh?<eos> This is who I am!<eos> And this is all I can give you for what you give me.<eos> For your hearts and your souls.<eos> Yesterday, I nearly lost my son.<eos> You should fucking understand that.<eos> For what?<eos> For what?

You can go, but you won't get far, Arthur.<eos> All right, Tom.<eos> I spoke to Moss last night.<eos> He told me that the Chief Constable of Birmingham has issued a warrant for your arrest.<eos> Murder, sedition, conspiracy to cause explosion.<eos> John, they're coming for you, as well.<eos> Murder.<eos> Conspiracy to cause explosion.<eos> - Michael...<eos> - What the fuck?
It's just this way, I get paid and Karl gets a nice Christmas.<eos> Good.<eos> Welcome to the Bourgeoisie.<eos> My name is Smith.<eos> My girlfriend is... is pregnant.<eos> And, er... we'd like you to help us.<eos> We need to fix a date.<eos> Welcome to Shelby Company Limited.<eos> Shelby Company Limited.<eos> Limited and unarmed.
I thought that was the idea.<eos> Yeah, Tommy but with a bit more fucking charm and class.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, that'll help(! )<eos> Yep.<eos> Where am I sleeping, Ada?<eos> - Michael...<eos> - In the room next to Karl's.<eos> - Michael...<eos> - Good night!
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> As we agreed, your jeweller will now select items to a total value of £70,000.<eos> When you have selected your chosen items, they will be put into a box and stored.<eos> When you have fulfilled your part of the deal, the box will be delivered to you.<eos> May I just start, right, by saying that I may choose to stay here and just starve to death and choke on sapphires rather than ever go back to the fucking world again?<eos> Yeah, well, there is a good reason for that, you know, little man.<eos> Because my shop, right, is just above a rum house, so all the... - You speak Russian?<eos> - I do, yeah. I do.<eos> Cos of me mum.
Yeah, my mother.<eos> You people, all right, you hunted my mum... with dogs... through the snow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But today, right, is for forgiveness, ain't it?<eos> For selection.<eos> So, now...<eos> Hello...<eos> Right.<eos> I think it's fair to say, yeah, 1,500.<eos> 1,500?
It's still wet.<eos> I know it isn't saying much in the grand scheme of things but this is the best work I've ever done.<eos> I'll miss Sundays.<eos> There will be more Sundays.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry, can you not do that, please?<eos> Can you just not do that, please?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry.
I moved.<eos> Would you open the back of the van, please, sir?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Happy to.<eos> What the...<eos> Hey, man, separate those two.<eos> It's a good thing you're here.<eos> Caught a weird one last night.<eos> That's it?<eos> No hug? No kiss? No "welcome back"?
That's it?<eos> No hug? No kiss? No "welcome back"?<eos> You don't deserve these lips.<eos> Way I see it, you finagled yourself a month-long paid vacation, you bastard.<eos> Besides, Captain's pressing me on this case.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What is it?<eos> You didn't hear?<eos> Last night, some psycho froze a cop.<eos> - To death.
I promise.<eos> - Got some good news and bad news.<eos> - Good news.<eos> Nygma did some digging, found one company in all of Gotham that makes liquid helium.<eos> - Wayne Enterprises.<eos> - That's the good news?<eos> It's not.<eos> But I thought "bad news and more bad news" didn't have the same ring.<eos> - Three abductions in the past month all tied to a blue van.<eos> Same as our suspect.
For what?<eos> The murder of Theo Galavan.<eos> My mother died in my arms because of Galavan.<eos> The only thing I regret is that I couldn't kill him more than once.<eos> I see.<eos> Perhaps we could pick it up right there next time.<eos> I so look forward to our work together.<eos> And don't worry... here at Arkham we have a number of intensive treatment programs.<eos> I am more than confident that we'll be able to facilitate your... rehabilitation.<eos> My what?
Just don't go.<eos> You win.<eos> I'm not trying to win, Ray.<eos> I really think at this point we should leave it to the lawyers.<eos> Just listen.<eos> Don't... I won't contest custody.<eos> Okay?<eos> He's yours.<eos> I know he'll be happy with you and...<eos> And Richard.
$12 million doesn't fit in a briefcase.<eos> The exchange will be secure.<eos> We can enter the money into the system as marketing costs, investment overlay.<eos> Like you did with Semyon?<eos> That was between him and Caspere.<eos> And your people's investments are worth considerably more to us.<eos> Now, please, enjoy the evening.<eos> Full moon is the best time to ratify alliances.<eos> A nation's strength is determined by two things, its energy resources<eos> and its capacity for war.
You shouldn't have.<eos> Out of the question!<eos> I don't know how it works!<eos> It's very small.<eos> You tricked me.<eos> "Meal at home..." with a name like Trap St,<eos> I should have guessed.<eos> I've made dinner.<eos> There's silver foil over it.<eos> "Silver foil"?
On with your little pyjamas.<eos> Watch what I'm doing, because I won't repeat it.<eos> Here's your little hand and your little foot.<eos> There we are.<eos> Little foot is in.<eos> Now, how about your little poppers?<eos> Yes. Little popper time.<eos> There we are. Lovely.<eos> They love to be spoken to.<eos> - What, in that tone?
Pass her to me.<eos> Come here.<eos> Shall we go and look at the sea?<eos> Come on. Come and see it with daddy.<eos> Come along then, darling.<eos> She's getting bigger.<eos> I was thinking: I'll give her my room and take yours.<eos> Once she starts walking, she'll need the space.<eos> I'm moving in with Simon.<eos> - With Louise?
I'll be alright.<eos> Me too...<eos> I'm taking it as well.<eos> Prozac?<eos> What's been happening to you?<eos> Oh, nothing serious.<eos> Just life, that's all.<eos> It's hard when the kids go, and it's really hit me.<eos> We've always been together, and now that she's gone...<eos> And Louise.
I've got something to say.<eos> If you can listen without getting on your high horse.<eos> I don't care if you're my son or not.<eos> I don't give a damn...<eos> I don't need DNA tests to know I like you.<eos> You're not perfect.<eos> You're angry, a grudge-bearer, but I appreciate you nonetheless.<eos> So if ever the idea appeals...<eos> I could try to be a father.<eos> Not your father!

Think about those jobs.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on, Bart.<eos> Bart?<eos> Why don't you come back sometime?<eos> Just you.<eos> Just me?<eos> I think you know how special you are.<eos> And special people deserve special attention, and I do have a lot of money, like you noticed, but money has never bought me happiness, and what I really want is grandchildren to spoil with gifts.<eos> Gifts?
Yeah.<eos> Come on, Bart.<eos> Bart?<eos> Why don't you come back sometime?<eos> Just you.<eos> Just me?<eos> I think you know how special you are.<eos> And special people deserve special attention, and I do have a lot of money, like you noticed, but money has never bought me happiness, and what I really want is grandchildren to spoil with gifts.<eos> Gifts?<eos> Like what kind of gifts?

Even a pet snake?<eos> Eww.<eos> But yes, darling, even a pet snake.<eos> Bart. Come on.<eos> It's late.<eos> Jory.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you ever wonder about your dad?<eos> Your real dad?<eos> Sometimes.
But he knows, corrine.<eos> They both know.<eos> You've poisoned my family again!<eos> If your family loves you based on a lie, then they don't love you at all, do they?<eos> Oh, you should know, shouldn't you?<eos> But I've changed!<eos> I can help them have a normal life.<eos> I can raise them properly, and if not both of them, then just Bart.<eos> He's such a special boy.<eos> A "normal life?"
I was wondering if you were ever gonna do that.<eos> Well, I've been a little busy.<eos> I'll get you some clothes while I'm out.<eos> Why don't you go to the police?<eos> With all that you have on the Russians?<eos> I wear a mask and beat on people.<eos> Doesn't exactly mesh with police policy.<eos> You're going to end up in another dumpster, you try to take down the entire Russian mob yourself.<eos> Maybe I only need to take down one man.<eos> Fisk?
Armand Tully?<eos> Sleaze bag owns buildings all over town.<eos> Sí, y señor Tully...<eos> He wants to convert the apartments to condominiums.<eos> And he wants them out.<eos> Men came weeks ago.<eos> They said that they were workers.<eos> And they destroyed the apartments with a...<eos> I don't know that last word.<eos> Sledgehammers.
This says Tully offered them 10,000 to give up their rent control and vacate the premises.<eos> Maybe we can pressure him into giving a better payout.<eos> No, Señor Foggy.<eos> We do no want money.<eos> We want to stay in our homes.<eos> This way, Mrs. Cardenas.<eos> I heard you say my name.<eos> Why'd you say my name?<eos> I told her you're going to talk to Tully's lawyer.<eos> Tully's lawyer?
Let them win?<eos> What you do is important...<eos> to so many people.<eos> I get that.<eos> I just don't think I can let myself fall in love with someone... who's so damn close to becoming what he hates.<eos> You're right... you shouldn't.<eos> A prince?<eos> I didn't know he was one at first.<eos> I was the curator and traveling with it... and all of a sudden... this tall man in a white suit and an ascot...<eos> An ascot?
But I kind of don't know how to feel.<eos> I mean, he was Tom from across the street, but he was also my brother.<eos> It's confusing.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> What if we hung lights inside the house?<eos> That could be cool.<eos> - Can I pick them out?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> There you go.<eos> Merry Christmas!
- Let's go tell Santa what you want for Christmas.<eos> - Mom.<eos> All this from the girl who made us wait in line twice 'cause she couldn't remember which doll she wanted.<eos> Tom!<eos> Wait, Tom!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I thought he was excited to come see Santa.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> Merry Christmas!
What'd you do, Tiger?<eos> - When did we crash?<eos> - You tell us, asshole.<eos> I guess I fell asleep.<eos> Yeah... with the engine running.<eos> Fully charged.<eos> Did you kill the battery too?<eos> You hear the radio?<eos> There's a skating rink about 11 miles from here.<eos> Big parking lot.
Meet me at the utility shed.<eos> This a new ride?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just turning it over.<eos> I think it's getting choked. Wrong filter.<eos> - She's a beaut.<eos> - What's up?<eos> Need some of the squad.<eos> Red laces only.<eos> - Tonight?
No.<eos> Ever since Lou became a nun, we don't talk much.<eos> She didn't become a nun.<eos> She ever tell you anything about your father?<eos> My mother was a hooker.<eos> I doubt she'd ever be able to finger the guilty party.<eos> - So to speak.<eos> - All she ever said was that my father was a client and some kind of genius.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, and, uh... and a total dick.
What is that, a dozen people?<eos> - Oh, dear. - The Inescapable Truth, along with spin-cycle bands and side projects.<eos> That's a lot of people.<eos> This guy left to form moo shoo wharf.<eos> Then he teamed up with this guy and this guy to form cash-bar wedding as a side project.<eos> And then these four guys, they make recordings as, uh, the days of wine and neurosis.<eos> But these guys actually also produce, uh, the Inescapable Truth cassette-only release.<eos> Oh, and sometimes all these 13, they play shows together as holy meat parade.<eos> Oh, and, uh, the bass player of holy meat is actually the singer of phantom Thomas Paine. While the horn player...<eos> Almond: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ever wonder what I was doing?<eos> I've been in places like this with people like you hundreds of time.<eos> I'm not trying to boast.<eos> I just want to allay any concerns you may have that I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> I just need to start by asking you a few questions.<eos> When's the last time you slept?<eos> What?<eos> Simple question.<eos> Try not to lie.<eos> Last night.
Ben?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi, Ben.<eos> Christy, I never did thank you for those flowers.<eos> They were beautiful.<eos> Tom was a wonderful boy.<eos> Always remember that.<eos> Um, see you.<eos> Merry Christmas.
This again?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> You don't trust me?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You haven't given me much reason to in a long time.<eos> I've tried to be patient.<eos> My entire world has been turned upside down, and I've stood by you.<eos> I've defended you time and time again.<eos> To who?

No one.<eos> It was nothing.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Everything is perfect.<eos> Genevieve, Zoila and I have something to ask you.<eos> What is it?<eos> We'd like you to be the witness at our wedding.<eos> - Me?<eos> Your maid of honor?<eos> - Witness.
No.<eos> Well, give it time.<eos> Adrian, I've informed Carmen that she is here on a trial basis only.<eos> I promise I won't disappoint you.<eos> Good.<eos> It's important to keep a beautiful home.<eos> We like to project a certain image to our neighbors.<eos> And here we have the Powell Murder House, which boasts not one, not two, but three gruesome deaths. [Camera shutters clicking]<eos> No, no!<eos> Two!
Excuse me.<eos> Yes. [Chuckles] Yeah.<eos> There.<eos> That's better.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You seem kind of quiet.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something bad happened.<eos> With my dress?
It is a red one, floor-length, lots of cleavage.<eos> - I lent it to her. - Ah.<eos> And she was supposed to return it last night, but she never showed up. Do you know if she left it for me?<eos> Uh...she cleaned out her room.<eos> She didn't even leave a note.<eos> I know. It's -<eos> - It's shocking.<eos> Do you know where she went?<eos> I'm guessing back home to Arizona.<eos> With my dress?
Thick and thin, remember?<eos> So, Ernesto didn't say anything to you about wanting you back?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> But obviously, he still has feelings for you.<eos> Of course.<eos> We were married.<eos> But you're married to me now.<eos> You're staying with me.<eos> You told him that, right?<eos> Not in so many words.
Well, i'm his stepfather, and i think that it is.<eos> Come on.<eos> We all agreed to get along.<eos> Remember?<eos> [ sighs ] When was the last time you went to church?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, i've been busy.<eos> Uh-huh?<eos> With the wedding. Mm-hmm.<eos> And the coma. And...
Very good at my job.<eos> I'd be more than willing to renovate a roomy basement,<eos> Perhaps a wine cellar.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> That all?<eos> Sorry. Have i offended you?<eos> Of -- of course not.<eos> I'm just running late for lunch.<eos> With my wife.<eos> Your wife?
I'll let taylor know.<eos> She certainly could use some help.<eos> So you see, christopher, as lovely as your invitation is, I can't go to greece with you.<eos> I understand.<eos> You barely know me.<eos> And here i am whisking you away to the other side of the world.<eos> I love being whisked.<eos> I hope you'll whisk me again someday.<eos> But right now, i need to stay here for zoila.<eos> Your maid?
Well, I remember like it was yesterday.<eos> You wore a flower like this in your hair.<eos> [Chuckles] And you were wearing your father's old suit.<eos> You had a smile on your face like...<eos> [Chuckles] Like that.<eos> And we pledged our lives to each other that day, in front of our families and in front of God.<eos> [Sighs] I can't accept this.<eos> It's a gift, and I'm not taking it back.<eos> Okay, so what do you take on your sandwich?<eos> Turkey?
[Giggles] Excuse me. We're kind of in the middle of something here.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Amber.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I've got this.<eos> Hi, Amber.<eos> It's good to meet you.<eos> But, as you can see, I am on a date.<eos> With her? Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, with me.
I'll give you a killer recommendation.<eos> Not that you're a killer.<eos> I think I'm gonna go now.<eos> Yes, Genevieve, I'm taking great care of Dr. Neff.<eos> Trust me, I will win him over before you come home.<eos> Kiss the kids for me.<eos> Mrs. Delatour having fun in New York with Remi and...<eos> Valentina.<eos> Does Dr. Neff like mayo or mustard on his sandwich?<eos> Dijon mustard.
Well, hello there, dear.<eos> Adrian, I have some appointments tomorrow.<eos> I will be gone all day.<eos> I need you to watch Deion.<eos> Oh, I'm sure Carmen can babysit.<eos> This isn't about Carmen.<eos> This is about you bonding with our child.<eos> As lovely as that sounds, I'm extremely busy tomorrow.<eos> With what?<eos> And also a nap.
Listen, you can just leave the child-rearing to me.<eos> You can focus on selling this house.<eos> - We're still on that?<eos> - Yes, we're still on that.<eos> We're starting a new chapter in our lives.<eos> A change of scenery would do us all good.<eos> Fine. I'll talk to the realtor.<eos> Don't look so grim!<eos> We're doing a wonderful thing.<eos> With the right education and opportunities,
Surprise!<eos> Hey, babe, what are you doing here?<eos> Well, I realized that I've never seen your place before, so I thought I would stop by... - and make you dinner. - Mmm.<eos> I hope I'm not interrupting.<eos> Not at all.<eos> [Door closes] I'm gonna make my famous Chicken a la Marisol.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - You're gonna love it.<eos> - It has onions... - Mmm!<eos> And peppers and...
So, while Mrs. Taylor's out of town with Katy, I've been busy getting ready for Miguel's party.<eos> - She took Katy?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Did they say when they will be back?<eos> Next week.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> Oh, just... want to know how long I'll have you to myself.<eos> Aww. That's nice.<eos> So, what can I do to help you with Miguel's party.<eos> Nothing.
Candace: Keep it straight, tom!<eos> No, no!<eos> To the left.<eos> No! No!<eos> The right! (zoe grunts)<eos> And i am in the most pain i've ever been in my entire life!<eos> And you know who i have to blame for that?<eos> But i wouldn't have it any other way because i can't wait To spend the rest of my life with you.<eos> Oh, god!<eos> And this baby!
You know my chief deputy, Lou Escobar?<eos> - We've met. Lou.<eos> - Harry.<eos> Have a seat, Detective.<eos> Are you familiar with the name Raynard Waits?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you should be talking to Johnson and Moore.<eos> They're handling that investigation.<eos> Oh, this involves you, as well.<eos> How so?
Different bunker.<eos> I swore I'd take that secret to my grave, and I did!<eos> But then I clawed my way out, and I still kept it.<eos> Oh, who are you?<eos> Mr. Belden, I'm Kimmy Schmidt.<eos> Schmidt!<eos> - You're a German spy.<eos> - No.<eos> I know a Kraut posing as a French prostitute when I see one.<eos> "Prostitute"? "French"?
- Currently on probation for a shoplift.<eos> - 34?<eos> Puts him two years older than Arthur.<eos> Could be our guy.<eos> I'll swing by and talk to his probation officer tomorrow.<eos> How about now?<eos> He's off for the day, Harry.<eos> It's after hours.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Somewhere between Barstow and civilization.
- It's great.<eos> Delicious.<eos> What's delicious?<eos> Hello, Harry.<eos> - Good morning, Reggie.<eos> - How are we today?<eos> Very well, sir. Thank you.<eos> Harry made my favorite pancakes.<eos> Oh. Chocolate chip, hmm?<eos> Banana.
Rochefort is a Spanish agent.<eos> He has been in the pay of the Madrid spy-master Vargas ever since his return.<eos> Dear God.<eos> I never meant to keep any secrets from you.<eos> But you must understand why I had to.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> If she were an ordinary woman... .. it might be possible, but she isn't.<eos> You have a child.<eos> I should have just walked away, but... .. I've never met a woman like her.<eos> Her courage, her endurance, her kindness.
You heard right. It's over.<eos> It is over.<eos> Is anybody up there?<eos> So... we decided... that you and me, and Dany, are going to do a ceremony for your friend.<eos> We'll do it with a lot of respect and a lot of love.<eos> That's what we're going to do. OK?<eos> A nice ceremony.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - The three of us.<eos> - With a lot of love.
Get in the car!<eos> All right, I'm getting in!<eos> Crazy woman.<eos> Tissues.<eos> Beignets on the dash.<eos> What are these -- are these beignets from bottega Louie?<eos> Geez. Okay.<eos> This is a seriously catered stakeout.<eos> Who are you watching?<eos> My husband. My husband.
I'm... I'm really excited for you to meet her.<eos> Hopefully soon, before I have to file for bankruptcy<eos> - and move to a cheaper state.<eos> - It won't come to that.<eos> But I do think it's time you hire yourself a good lawyer.<eos> I wish Savi were here right now.<eos> Hey. Niko.<eos> Hey! It's the man of the hour!<eos> Ellis.<eos> Whoa, no!
Seriously. So much.<eos> No. Oh, no.<eos> I-I'm actually the one who should be grateful because I've been so busy today that I've actually stopped thinking about Harry for five seconds.<eos> Hallelujah!<eos> Thank you, Jesus!<eos> I- know. [Chuckles]<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> I mean, yeah, he's... he's hot and everything, especially with that sexy accent.<eos> Wait a second. No, wait.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.
So you're saying Harry's not sad?<eos> I'm not saying that at all.<eos> I'm sure he's sad.<eos> That's probably why he's acting out.<eos> Acting out how?<eos> Is Harry already dating another woman?<eos> Dating? No.<eos> Definitely not.<eos> But he had sex with another woman.<eos> Who?
I'll be back in tonight.<eos> - Yeah? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Hey, look, if you're not up for it...<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Why were you going through my backpack?<eos> I wasn't going through your backpack.<eos> The point is, baby, it's amazing.<eos> I am proud of you!<eos> A-plus?
Um, how long have you been in the life?<eos> Oh, about seven or eight days.<eos> "Days"?<eos> Uh, I admire your bravery.<eos> It took me years to come out and feel comfortable with myself.<eos> If I can give you a little advice.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> I'm kind of out of my element.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Of what?

Calista fed them enough incriminating details - for them to build one.<eos> - What details?<eos> - Have you seen Basic Instinct?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Why?<eos> The police are asserting that you murdered Luca because you were obsessed and in love with Calista.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> They talked to another witness who inadvertently corroborated Calista's twisted version of you.<eos> - Who?
Well, it's the only one you have if you want to follow the teachings of the church.<eos> I know it's difficult, but this child deserves a stable, loving family despite the unfortunate circumstances that brought it into the world.<eos> "Unfortunate circumstances"?<eos> The relationship that you've found yourself in...<eos> Husband and wife possibly divorcing now.<eos> How would you raise a child amidst all that uncertainty?<eos> Shrouded in shame and secrecy or in some polyamorous attempt at a family if they decide to stay together?<eos> The fact that the couple chose to enter into a sinful relationship in the first place is evidence of their poor moral character.<eos> How would you ever explain this situation to your child?<eos> With compassion, sensitivity, and patience...
The things I thought I'd get from you.<eos> Karen, it was never my intention to offend you.<eos> Well, you have, father.<eos> And I don't care what your limited heart doesn't understand about my relationship with Alec and Vivian.<eos> When this child asks, I'm going to tell him he was conceived in pure love, which is far more than a lot of kids can say about their parents.<eos> You're letting your emotions get the best of you.<eos> Thank freaking God.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's Calista Raines' house right up there.<eos> Through those gates.
Agreed.<eos> Let's get your client booked and off to prison.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> - You're back.<eos> - Of course I'm back.<eos> Now, we don't have much time, so listen.<eos> I was discussing your situation with my agent...<eos> Wait...<eos> Your agent?
Hi, there, baby.<eos> I'm Vivian.<eos> And these two beautiful people by my side are your mom...<eos> And your dad.<eos> And I love them both dearly.<eos> I won't get to meet you...<eos> Which really sucks.<eos> Because I know that you would've been the most amazing thing to have happened in my life.<eos> And God knows my life has been filled...<eos> With amazing things.
Maybe we should think about transferring you to another agent.<eos> T-that is not necessary at... seriously, Harry, I believe in you and think you could be a very important client for us.<eos> I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that.<eos> I'll still cover the Dispirito meeting.<eos> Here's some articles to brush up on.<eos> We'll talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is Ari.<eos> We should call the police.<eos> Shh.
hot awesome sex foxes are supposed to leave rich nerds, not the other way around.<eos> But it's okay.<eos> Paul was just too reserved to be compatible with someone like me who just wants to truly live.<eos> And sprawl.<eos> And sprawl, Gretch.<eos> Gotta sprawl.<eos> So you haven't seen him?<eos> He's been busy planning his new future with the chat room girl.<eos> - Beer cooze?<eos> - Beer cooze.
And I haven't had ice cream in at least nine years.<eos> I haven't either.<eos> Have you... have you talked to Robert since you've been back?<eos> No.<eos> I heard rumors, though.<eos> I guess he's on an adventure of his own, isn't he.<eos> Well, that's an interesting way to put it.<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> Every day a little better.
And he makes me feel like shit.<eos> I thought that dogs were supposed to love you unconditionally.<eos> Isn't that the whole point?<eos> You have to take him back.<eos> The dog is broken.<eos> One of you certainly is.<eos> - I prefer to think that it's the dog.<eos> - Well, I'm enjoying thinking it's you.<eos> Why do I care what a guy who has six dogs thinks of me?<eos> Five.
Five bucks for a dime bag? I want some.<eos> Thin walls.<eos> Here you go.<eos> No, no, no. No weapons in juvie.<eos> Pop Rocks and Fire Ants.<eos> I figured Carl could use them for self-defense.<eos> Is that a thing? Who knows.<eos> I wanna go to Planned Parenthood today.<eos> I need you to come with.<eos> For the pill?
That's the one I got in the Army.<eos> How'd you get that one?<eos> I tried to hotwire a helicopter, burned myself on the starter.<eos> - You can hotwire a helicopter?<eos> - Not very good, apparently.<eos> I got caught trying to steal government property and that's why the MPs are after me.<eos> Well, that and going AWOL.<eos> And enlisting under a false identity and maybe other stuff.<eos> Wow, pretty hardcore.<eos> No, just mentally ill.
Did you never have children?<eos> It's 2:00 now.<eos> Ove, I have to do the written part as well.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> Uhhuh.<eos> It's part of the driver's test.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That will be really nice.<eos> You know them already.<eos> - Who?

Sonja always helped other people.<eos> Okay, come on, then.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I made some toast, if that's okay.<eos> And I made a little coffee, too.<eos> - I'm going to go on my rounds.<eos> - Aren't you going to have coffee first?<eos> I made a little bit here.<eos> Sandwiches with cheese and stuff.<eos> Before the rounds?
- David?<eos> - The year 700.<eos> - B.C.<eos> - Tool.<eos> Let's say hello to Richard Stenebo.<eos> Welcome to our class.<eos> - Hi, Richard!<eos> - Welcome.<eos> I'm not lying. In one year, the same student could cite 400-year-old poetry with ease at graduation.<eos> So infinite in her skills.
O.J.'s, Nicole's and Goldman's?<eos> Bobby, we don't have the whole police force out there chasing leads.<eos> W-We got to be patient.<eos> The truth will find us.<eos> It always does.<eos> There's something on the TV.<eos> I think you better see it.<eos> Can't you record it?<eos> Johnnie, Barbara is on A Current Affair.<eos> With Patricia. Both of them.
To teach him forgiveness.<eos> Or let him take his own path, however destructive that may be for him.<eos> Charlie...<eos> You've shown me, Ken.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Ken.<eos> I need to open his mind, not his skull.<eos> -(Laughs) -I'm serious, Charlie.<eos> He's tied to me.<eos> My family.
He's cool.<eos> He gets you laid. Gets you high.<eos> He's the one who tipped me off to Jimmy too's game.<eos> Shake him down.<eos> So...<eos> Why should I trust you, my friend?<eos> Look, if I'm not welcome, I can just... 173rd airborne?<eos> That's right.<eos> -In country?<eos> -No, Beverly hills.
I hate my father.<eos> He has never loved me.<eos> He doesn't even think I'm pretty.<eos> Cherry...<eos> You...<eos> Are the prettiest girl on earth.<eos> Do you know my father's secret?<eos> Look, cherry you accept there's no past, no future.<eos> There's only what we feel, what we know right here in our skin,<eos> -in our hearts.
You promised.<eos> Promised what?<eos> You're starting to screw up.<eos> I know you, I can feel it.<eos> You know you can talk to me.<eos> Talk to you?<eos> About what?<eos> Hello?<eos> I'd like to speak to Mrs Cayla.<eos> Yes, the judge.
- Take it.<eos> ♪ You are my sun, look at me please.<eos> ♪ My palm has turned into a fist.<eos> ♪ And if there's gunpowder, give me the match.<eos> ♪ That's how.<eos> It's from 1919.<eos> To Greg, for his medal!<eos> So there's me, there's him, and I sneak up from behind and bam!<eos> And that's it, he's out.<eos> [German] Merry Christmas!
Once again, we have repelled the enemy from the walls of the city.<eos> Sevastopol lives!<eos> And Sevastopol will live!<eos> Leonid, I want you meet Boris, he's my friend from before the war.<eos> Boris.<eos> Leonid.<eos> In view of the arrival of the ammunition,<eos> I'm ordering the immediate elimination of 1,500 boxes of champagne.<eos> We must all do our part to clear the storage tunnels.<eos> Happy New Year 1942!

It's time to take your rightful place at the King's side, Captain.<eos> You will NOT refuse me a second time.<eos> It will be my honour, Majesty.<eos> I need to tell you all something.<eos> I'm resigning my commission and retiring at the monastery at Douai.<eos> He's going to become a monk?<eos> I made a vow to God and I have to honour it.<eos> If I'd told you sooner, you would have just tried ~ to talk me out of it. ~ We're still going to.<eos> Is this really what you want?<eos> With all my heart.
With all my heart.<eos> Farewell then, old friend.<eos> ~ Are we just going to let him go?<eos> ~ No.<eos> He's letting us go.<eos> ~ You'll be missed.<eos> ~ Take care of Constance.<eos> ~ Of course.<eos> All for one.<eos> ALL:
I am the Brotherhood.<eos> Take care of your family.<eos> Don't you come in here and tell me to take care of my family, you fucking traitor.<eos> We will fucking bury you.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Better watch your back, big brother.<eos> Tough day, Kai?<eos> So, I see there's been a family reunion.<eos> Now, tell me, Kai, who the fuck am I in business with?<eos> You or her?
So, Liv's not here, she'll be back shortly.<eos> Would you like to wait for her?<eos> I don't... I don't really need to wait. Okay.<eos> Uh, I can for a couple of minutes, if you need me to.<eos> Um, is now not a good time?<eos> Do you need to finish up or something?<eos> I'm sorry, this is an incredibly strange conversation.<eos> Are you here to see Liv?<eos> No. I thought I was here to talk to you.<eos> - Me?
- You're trespassing, Freddie.<eos> - I was trespassing before the blood dried.<eos> When did they call you in?<eos> - I'm not talking to you.<eos> - We're co-conspirators, Will.<eos> - I died for you and your cause.<eos> - You didn't die enough.<eos> You came into my hospital room while I was sleeping, flipped back the covers and snapped a photo of my temporary colostomy bag.<eos> Covered your junk with a black box.<eos> A big black box.
- Thank you.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hello, Dr. Lecter.<eos> I wanted to tell you that I am delighted that you have taken an interest in me.<eos> I don't believe you would tell them who I am, even if you knew.<eos> The important thing... is what I am becoming.<eos> I knew, you alone would understand this.<eos> Tell me.<eos> What are you becoming?<eos> The Great...
- Hello?<eos> - Hello, Dr. Lecter.<eos> I wanted to tell you that I am delighted that you have taken an interest in me.<eos> I don't believe you would tell them who I am, even if you knew.<eos> The important thing... is what I am becoming.<eos> I knew, you alone would understand this.<eos> Tell me.<eos> What are you becoming?<eos> The Great...<eos> Red Dragon.
I would love to meet him.'<eos> I'm Francis Dolarhyde.<eos> Miss McClane, can I give you a ride home?<eos> 'Have you considered that he may believe he is disfigured? '<eos> May I touch your face?<eos> I just want to know if you're smiling or frowning.<eos> - I'm smiling.<eos> - 'Hello, Dr Lecter.'<eos> 'What are you becoming?<eos> ' 'The Great Red Dragon.'
Do you know how you feel about her?<eos> Yes.<eos> I...<eos> I'm afraid she will come to the house to talk.<eos> I don't know what will happen in the house.<eos> The Dragon may come down.<eos> I know how easily she would tear.<eos> I think about what the Dragon will do to me if I don't serve her up.<eos> She called me a man.<eos> A sweet... man.
You don't remember how you met him?<eos> - I meet a lot of people.<eos> - Really?<eos> You meet a lot of cops in here?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You didn't know Acker was a police officer?<eos> - He's a cop?<eos> - Yeah, and he rolled on you.<eos> I got nothing to do with them.<eos> - With who?
Hitler's got enough on his plate without picking a fight with us.<eos> His appetite for territory seems rather insatiable.<eos> Will you be there this evening?<eos> If I can get away.<eos> - Oh, do try and make it, Miriam.<eos> Turning out in force to oppose Joyce's proposition is the only way to get it thrown out.<eos> Will you be there, Alison?<eos> Of course.<eos> Boxing gloves on.<eos> Granite chin at the ready.
Shame... on... you.<eos> If we walk slower, it might not hurt so much.<eos> I can't walk slower, Mr Wilson.<eos> I'm late.<eos> Well, why don't we leave your bike here... and I'll get you to where you need to be double-quick on the back of mine?<eos> Sure you can carry me?<eos> You're no heavier than a bag of mail.<eos> - Charming!<eos> A small, light, bag of mail. - Hmm.<eos> Uncommonly pretty eyes.
Well, don't look so worried.<eos> Anyone can make a mistake.<eos> Why won't you take my money?<eos> If you hadn't allowed us to pick your fruit, we'd never have made all this.<eos> I'm not going until you let me pay for it.<eos> Not for the WI and not for you.<eos> For the fleet.<eos> It would be lovely to see you at our meeting this evening.<eos> Busy, I'm afraid.<eos> All the more reason.
Greg done somethin' wrong? No. No, no, we're just looking for some information.<eos> But I...<eos> I think we're talking about an older son who participated in a psychological study back in 1982?<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> This isn't a good time. - Why don't you come...<eos> - Please, please.<eos> Please, I'm not asking you as a federal agent.<eos> I'm... I'm asking you as a parent.<eos> Our son... has been speaking with Drill.<eos> Drill?
- Three minutes.<eos> Thomas, does Drill still speak to you?<eos> The doctors said I just stopped hearing the whispers because the medication was working.<eos> But you and I know better.<eos> We know better about what?<eos> When did he stop talking to you?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Thomas, we are here because we wanna help our son.<eos> We want Drill to leave him alone, and anything that you can tell us Drill is talking to your son?<eos> And other kids, too.
- What?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> You were the one guzzling down chips.<eos> If you guzzle chips you should do the dishes.<eos> Or is that my job?<eos> So, why haven't you done the dishes?<eos> You used this one, right?<eos> How about this one?<eos> You used this bowl as well, right?<eos> And these spoons too!
So he's competitive.<eos> Isn't that the nature of the game?<eos> Honour and sportsmanship is the nature of the game, Detective.<eos> Not always the nature of those that play it.<eos> Believe me, there is nothing Hank wouldn't do to win that trophy.<eos> If the...<eos> Go on.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> If you knew Shelly so well, even from a distance, how did she seem to you?<eos> Tired.
Where?<eos> Pull over!<eos> How was your jog, JP?<eos> Pretending to be grief stricken on the ride home was smart.<eos> But you should have found a better place to hide the keys.<eos> Jasmine...<eos> We'd have lost everything.<eos> Our money, our reputation.<eos> Win at any cost, that's what you taught me.<eos> At any cost?
Ensure the talk continues.<eos> Make it the card table gossip.<eos> Leave us now.<eos> - Sire, before...<eos> - Do not address the king directly.<eos> I think he already has.<eos> The men we apprehended wore Spanish leather.<eos> If I wore clogs would that make me Dutch?<eos> - You would have me be silent?<eos> - Deeply.
- You are so strange!<eos> It seems that rivers of gold run in his lands.<eos> At which distance are we from these trees?<eos> Majesty, everything takes place according to your plan.<eos> The prince Annaba is destabilised.<eos> Very well.<eos> Make him wait.<eos> It has been said to me that my dear friends Parthenay arrive at Versailles from the South.<eos> - Does little Françoise also come?<eos> - With her husband and her family.
My most trusted man has a brother in a royal depot in Paris. He spoke of a shipment making its way to Versailles.<eos> It'll be heavily guarded and they'll fight to the end to defend it.<eos> You raised me from the dead, my Lord, I'll lay down my life for you.<eos> Good.<eos> Because as I hear this is a cargo worth dying for.<eos> I will speak to the King.<eos> Perhaps your hearing is suspect.<eos> The King is not to be disturbed.<eos> He's in private conference.<eos> With whom?
If you say so, Sire.<eos> No, please!<eos> - It's your turn, Moncourt. - No, please, no!<eos> - I know you.<eos> - You used to know me.<eos> Nobles don't dig.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> We are surrounded.<eos> By conspirators.<eos> By criticism.
No, please!<eos> - It's your turn, Moncourt. - No, please, no!<eos> - I know you.<eos> - You used to know me.<eos> Nobles don't dig.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> We are surrounded.<eos> By conspirators.<eos> By criticism.<eos> By wilderness and danger.
Blood pressure's up to 90 over 45.<eos> That's good news.<eos> I heard you performed an iliac repair in a moving ambulance.<eos> That's very impressive.<eos> It wasn't my first choice, but the packing wasn't slowing down the bleeding, so...<eos> He would have bled out.<eos> It's a good call.<eos> I can work with that. Let's get him up to the OR.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Right behind you.
Aw. I'm alive.<eos> Look, if we're gonna do this, there's a hell of a lot that we need to figure out.<eos> Like?<eos> Like how we're gonna work together now that we're together.<eos> I can't focus on my job if I'm worried about you.<eos> T.C. and Jordan are not the same as Dr. Callahan and Dr. Alexander, so we need to find the line.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> We found it before.<eos> We were residents, okay?<eos> Kids.
Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, bud.<eos> And we've just received hospital privileges for you to perform the surgery.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> So, um, Dr. Clemmens, you'll allow me to use your O.R.?<eos> And perhaps an 11 blade?<eos> Look, I'm sorry if you felt that I was...<eos> Tactless.<eos> Disrespectful.
Disrespectful.<eos> Rude...<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad.<eos> You're the only one capable of the procedure that will save her life.<eos> Okay?<eos> So, please, just... just do it.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll perform the procedure.<eos> Under two conditions.
- Let me get into it. All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Now we gave him something for the pain.<eos> Okay?<eos> This is for you. Okay.<eos> The quietest I've ever seen him.<eos> How's he doin'?<eos> Well, his hip is healing fine, but we're having trouble getting his heart rate down.<eos> Did he have a history with drugs?<eos> Alcohol?
I got, uh, $40 for the next crazy patient.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, what is it?<eos> I can tell on your face it ain't good.<eos> It's not great.<eos> Um, based off the results of your EMG and, uh, the numbness in your legs, the weakness in your hands, and difficulty swallowing and...<eos> Just say it, would you?<eos> You have A.L.S.<eos> What? It's that ice-bucket thing?<eos> Yes, the ice-bucket thing.
I can't leave her.<eos> - No, Tee.<eos> - You don't need to see this.<eos> I'll observe and I'll update you with any news.<eos> I promise.<eos> And we'll be right here with you, buddy, all right?<eos> She's gonna be okay.<eos> This guy is a mess.<eos> The abdominal cavity is pooling all the blood in his body.<eos> - More O-Neg now.
I thought you were picking him up?<eos> How're you gonna do that when he's down here?<eos> Yes, here at the precinct.<eos> Just now.<eos> No, you figure it out.<eos> Just tell him the way it happens.<eos> Right, well, the...<eos> The way it happens.<eos> Well, it happens in a lot of ways.<eos> Not always the same, but usually... usually in the usual way.
Judges of the Wesenrein Tribunal, assembled guests,<eos> I will now present the evidence supporting the charges of Agnes Fleischelblut and Grimace Freunschafteweisen against the defendant.<eos> Let me state for all here that these crimes are capital crimes, and I will prove beyond any doubt...<eos> Whoa, whoa, hang on.<eos> Just a procedural clarification.<eos> Isn't it supposed to be "beyond any reasonable doubt?"<eos> Muzzle him.<eos> Rah!<eos> Aah!<eos> After him!
Previously on Killjoys...<eos> Our agents are guided by one principle.<eos> One code.
Why are you giving this to me?<eos> 'Cause you're a good reporter.<eos> And the only one I know.<eos> You're not the only one who's fast.<eos> Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> - If you came to check on me, that is really sweet, but I think everything's gonna be okay.<eos> Uh... I actually am not here to see you.<eos> No?<eos> No, I have a lunch date.<eos> With who?
Three weeks ago, an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world.<eos> The dome has tested our limits...<eos> Go!<eos> ...pitting us against one another.<eos> Chester's Mill sentences Dale Barbara to death.<eos> ...and forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons... rage...<eos> I need to know that you will stand with me against that!<eos> ...grief...

Julia.<eos> Junior.<eos> Julia!<eos> I'm here.<eos> Just like I promised.<eos> I came back for you.<eos> Hunter, Jawbreaker 2-3, we're less than a klick out.<eos> Got you covered, boss.<eos> Got a drone over the location, no activity in the surrounding area.<eos> All right, on me.
That's right.<eos> I'm sorry, Molly, but cameras were offline during that period.<eos> Gina...<eos> Peter Robot has a motion-activated camera, right?<eos> Yes, Molly.<eos> Can you access that drive?<eos> Same time frame, please.<eos> What would you like to see?<eos> All footage of John.<eos> And Julie.
I'm gonna bring you a mug of half-and-half.<eos> - Okay, Ma.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Sweetheart, how many times do I have to tell you?<eos> You are way too old to be playing basketball.<eos> Ah, maybe you should tell that to the young bucks I whupped up on today.<eos> So, are those the same young bucks that carried you off the court or the ones that drove you to the hospital?<eos> Both.<eos> I'm just saying, if you're gonna keep playing basketball, I think you really need to play a less intense game, maybe with more...<eos> Colins and Ethans and less Maliks and Jamals.
We love you, too.<eos> - The kids did a nice job. - Mm-hmm.<eos> So, what'd you end up getting your man?<eos> Oh, nothing big.<eos> Just those four children over there making him cry tears of joy.<eos> - Cop-out. - Oh.<eos> Also, later tonight, I plan on doing things to your son that are gonna make it very hard for him to ride a motorcycle anytime soon.<eos> Girl, I don't want to hear that!<eos> [Gasps] Oh, no, no. Wait!<eos> Unh-unh! Unh-unh!
- What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - Come on, Walter, let's do it!<eos> - We have a lot to talk about.<eos> C- learly.<eos> - Over dinner?<eos> - Go!<eos> All right, just punch me.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - Punch me as hard as you can, go!<eos> Hard as--
We're not seeing it on radar.<eos> Yes, he's probably flying out over the water.<eos> I'd go south along the Arabian Sea, hug the Yemeni coast, then turn right, up the Red Sea.<eos> Five hours would put it over the Gulf of Aden.<eos> Right, but their plane could barely make it to Israel, let alone all the way back to Pakistan, without refueling.<eos> It's a suicide mission.<eos> Talbot, listen to me!<eos> You need to get Zaman to recall that pilot.<eos> How?<eos> By any means necessary.
He was outta there so fast, it was like he knew I was coming.<eos> And the guy that contracted her is dead, too, killed maybe a day before Julio found her.<eos> That can't be a coincidence.<eos> I don't think so either.<eos> Someone wants to make sure that I really can't find out who's behind the hits on the drug business.<eos> The hit on me...<eos> Rolla didn't hire her.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - 'Cause she told me, Tash.<eos> Right before.
How can I care for our city when I... cannot even care for my own child?<eos> We need only weather this storm until Clarice and Lorenzo return.<eos> If they return.<eos> Has the Naples fleet arrived in Otranto?<eos> Arrived and vanquished.<eos> Destroyed before reaching shore.<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> Rome will be next.<eos> They will be coming for us.<eos> For me!
My murderous brother and his Sons of Mithras... ..may have given us an opportunity.<eos> In killing a trusted advisor they have also killed... ..a native son of Venice.<eos> Surely that will stir the appropriate sentiments.<eos> What an excellent notion, Your Holiness.<eos> We can utilize the Cardinal's death to our advantage.<eos> I have received word that Rodrigo's sister,<eos> Laura Cereta, intends to claim her brother's body.<eos> Her father owns one of the largest merchant fleets in the Republic.<eos> You'll need to be er...hm...<eos> delicate.
If it was not for the magic you wield... ..I would kill you where you stand.<eos> Magic...is only science that you do not yet understand.<eos> Sixtus was right.<eos> About you.<eos> The Sons of Mithras.<eos> All of it.<eos> You're in league with them.<eos> Everything you told me was a lie.<eos> No.<eos> No lies.
It's now or never, Signorina.<eos> You were supposed to deal with this.<eos> She requested an audience with us both.<eos> Demanded, more likely.<eos> The woman carries herself with the refinement of a tonsured goat.<eos> We do need her support if we're to win over Venice.<eos> If Laura Cereta has asked to see me, I assure you it is not to offer cooperation.<eos> Your Holiness.<eos> Signora.<eos> Girolamo.
I've got good news, Dad.<eos> I figured out a way to pay for everything Hakeem wants for his video.<eos> So, we feature another artist with him, and we take the money from that promotion budget.<eos> Who do you have in mind? Tiana.<eos> Everybody loves them together.<eos> (sighing): Hmm... And we should be the ones to capitalize on that, right?<eos> There's no way around this?<eos> Yeah, that's smart, but now you gotta figure out how to deal with her manager.<eos> Cookie.<eos> Yeah, your mama.
A... what?<eos> Ah, so now who forgot our anniversary?<eos> I guess I did.<eos> I-I'm just surprised that you remembered.<eos> Yeah, I never forgot.<eos> Don't you remember what it was like when we were young and broke?<eos> Yeah, I remember. (laughs)<eos> I was mad at you, 'cause I thought you forgot, so... I hit you with a...<eos> Stiletto.<eos> A shoe.
Compared to how he used to be?<eos> He's different.<eos> He'll go back and forth from you know, being depressed to, you know, incredibly wound up.<eos> Yeah, I mean, he ran off with a baby for no reason.<eos> He almost hit me in the head with a baseball bat.<eos> Our mother was bipolar. So we know what it looks like.<eos> She put us through hell, and... I'm not saying that you put us through hell. But when they're manic they can be destructive.<eos> Does he require medication?<eos> Yes. Is he unable to care for himself?<eos> Sometimes, yes.
Not you.<eos> The world in you.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I'll walk no further.<eos> You aren't sorry, are you?<eos> No.<eos> What, then?<eos> I...<eos> I thought I'd done with it all.<eos> With what?
The world in you.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I'll walk no further.<eos> You aren't sorry, are you?<eos> No.<eos> What, then?<eos> I...<eos> I thought I'd done with it all.<eos> With what?<eos> Life.
I believe I am.<eos> You have the look of your mother about you.<eos> Marie-Cesette, the love of my life.<eos> The love of your life died abandoned<eos> and in despair in the slum they call the Court of Miracles.<eos> If I had only known, I would have moved heaven and earth to find you.<eos> My husband told me we have visitors.<eos> Your husband?<eos> Levesque, you met him in the grounds.<eos> Ah, yes, with the maids.
She blames herself entirely.<eos> Yeah, she actually said that leaving here was the biggest mistake she ever made because...<eos> I lost millions in stock options, but I thank God every day that I don't have to work with that pompous asshole. Ha.<eos> She never embraced the notion that this company's on a divine mission to reshape the universe.<eos> Not to mention he's really warmed to the idea of serving a low-end market.<eos> Ellis loves your car.<eos> Here's another headline: "Gage Founder Again Chokes on Own Dick<eos> "Before Building Any Version of Maya's Cheap Ass Electric Crap Box."<eos> You don't think Japan is gonna reverse engineer your technology in a nanosecond and flood the market?<eos> Probably with a ludicrous markup, too.
Hold on. I got another call.<eos> Hello.<eos> JT, I'm sending you a blood sample.<eos> How soon can you find out if it's enhanced?<eos> Enhanced?<eos> What do you mean enhanced?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I don't have a lot of time.<eos> Well, maybe you and Vincent should talk first, you know?<eos> Vincent?
And I expect when we're her age, we'll feel the same.<eos> - Thank you, Becky.<eos> - You're welcome, Becky.<eos> By the time I'm Miss Redman's age, I expect to be on my second husband.<eos> Ever the romantic.<eos> But first you may want to find number one.<eos> And who would you pick, Freddy, from this pool of too eager candidates?<eos> I guess that depends on what one looks for in a man.<eos> If I were Peggy, I would choose someone tall and dashing.<eos> Maybe someone with an elegant little braid.
Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Mom -- What's going on?<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> What's it look like we're doing?<eos> Well, it looks like you're arresting a dangerous parole violator, Agent Cho.<eos> Parole violator?<eos> What did I do?<eos> Consorting with a known felon.<eos> Who?
Stop it!<eos> Mom -- What's going on?<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> What's it look like we're doing?<eos> Well, it looks like you're arresting a dangerous parole violator, Agent Cho.<eos> Parole violator?<eos> What did I do?<eos> Consorting with a known felon.<eos> Who?<eos> Kelvin Bittaker.
These guys do not play.<eos> These stash houses... think you can get me a location on them?<eos> Did you not hear a word I just said?<eos> The stash houses could give us evidence linking Flass to Littlefield's murder.<eos> We nail him for Littlefield, we can nail him for Winkler.<eos> I can't let it be, Harvey.<eos> You should know that by now.<eos> Mick, it's Harv.<eos> You know that thing you and Donnie were working on?<eos> The Flass thing?
Detective Flass had a lot of friends, and your partner arrested him for murder.<eos> Accidents happen.<eos> You put the cuffs on him.<eos> So we should all be careful.<eos> To hell with them.<eos> Barbara?<eos> Hi.<eos> Let go of me.<eos> How long you been here?<eos> Just last night.
I can still come with you, if you want me to.<eos> No.<eos> It wouldn't be right.<eos> No. Of course.<eos> I'll be fine, Alfred.<eos> - You don't have to worry.<eos> - Who said I was worried?<eos> I'll be back before dark.<eos> I've been on this hike before, you know.<eos> Not without your father.
Okay. Get up!<eos> Gerald called in one day and said he wasn't coming in. That's the last I heard of him.<eos> Let me guess, about three weeks ago?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's when neighbors said he up and moved out.<eos> - Unis searched the place, nothing.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> So, what can you tell us about Crane?<eos> He was a good teacher.<eos> Focused, and a good father.
Yeah.<eos> That's when neighbors said he up and moved out.<eos> - Unis searched the place, nothing.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> So, what can you tell us about Crane?<eos> He was a good teacher.<eos> Focused, and a good father.<eos> He was very protective of his son, Jonathan.<eos> But he could be quiet too.<eos> Somber.
It includes a dance and everything.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm Miriam Loeb.<eos> Did-did my father send you?<eos> Ms. Kringle.<eos> Oh, Mr. Nygma.<eos> Ms. Kringle, I was wondering if you had dinner plans this evening.<eos> Oh, um... actually, I...<eos> I do.<eos> With Tom.
And you'll keep doing it.<eos> You're willing to hold my daughter hostage to achieve your ends?<eos> You're much colder than I thought.<eos> So it seems.<eos> I'll hand in my resignation today.<eos> Just keep Miriam out of it.<eos> No, you're not resigning.<eos> You step down, I'll have someone else to deal with.<eos> And chances are he'll be Falcone's lapdog, same as you.<eos> With you...
You stabbed him.<eos> What do you care? I care!<eos> He's all right, isn't he?<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Throw them out! - No!<eos> - Tell me who sent you.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> ! You shouldn't be doing this, Bruce.<eos> Only Alfie can deal with these people.<eos> What people?
BULLOCK: Yeah?<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Okeydoke.<eos> No body, no crime.<eos> No body, no crime.<eos> Nope.<eos> Never seen him before.<eos> We think this is a serial killer called the Ogre.<eos> He's kidnapped a woman, and he's gonna kill her unless we find him first.<eos> Bummer.
He would be gearing up to do what needs to be done.<eos> Yes, we're dealing with forces we don't understand, but HYDRA I do understand.<eos> I want everyone ready when the sun comes up... end of discussion.<eos> Hope you're feeling better this morning, Mr. Bakshi, because you have a date with the U.S. government.<eos> Smile.<eos> There he is, general.<eos> Sunil Bakshi... the man tied to the Navy wedding massacre, the U.N. attack, and who tried to kill you, Coulson.<eos> While dressed up as you, sir.<eos> Safe to say, I'm not a fan.<eos> Perfect.
How about we let my dad know?<eos> - Is this your high school?<eos> - I never went here.<eos> My dad coached football and taught history.<eos> - Were you close?<eos> - I was 9 when he died.<eos> I've forgotten more about him than I remember.<eos> Angar.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome you to this historic matchup between the S.H.I.E.L.D. Eagles and us, rivals and underdogs, the... Slicing...<eos> Talons?
Are you gonna stand by while we hurt them?<eos> Aw, Phil.<eos> This is between us!<eos> No one else needs to get hurt.<eos> - Let them go.<eos> - They can't go anywhere.<eos> What did you do?<eos> ! Took a cue from S.H.I.E.L.D. we took their potential and contained it,<eos> - inhibited it like you do.<eos> - To criminals, not cheerleaders.
So you want to put down Coulson and Skye?<eos> I want to avoid it.<eos> His actions are leading us to a deadly showdown.<eos> Help me find him, and we'll stop it.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> When he's ready, he'll find you.<eos> Coulson is the one man... You can never put down.<eos> You always travel with whiskey and shot glasses?<eos> Never know when you're gonna need something to keep you warm on a cold night.<eos> - Two glasses?
I was too afraid to hope.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I wanted to run to you the second I saw you, Wrap you in my arms.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Because you were forced into going through the mist.<eos> Joining our people had to be your choice.<eos> You deserved that.<eos> At st. Agnes, all the kids pray That their parents are out there, looking for them.<eos> You were.<eos> For years.
- A murderer and a traitor.<eos> Sorry.<eos> My offer's the only way you leave here.<eos> I'm taking a huge chance.<eos> You could have run.<eos> You didn't.<eos> You risked your freedom for her ... that says something, says that maybe there's still good left in you.<eos> Maybe Garrett, your family didn't destroy all that.<eos> Tahiti will erase all the bad, let you be the man you want to be, start over.<eos> Free and clear.
You know Mike Peterson's hardware.<eos> - You want me to try to tap into his feed?<eos> - Will that be a problem?<eos> An opportunity to exonerate Coulson and Fitz?<eos> No, it's not a problem.<eos> I'll keep you updated.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> We want to find Skye, yes, okay?<eos> - But we are making a deal with...<eos> - The devil.
She left on a Quinjet with... you.<eos> - I didn't leave with Bobbi.<eos> That's...<eos> - Agent 33.<eos> She killed her guard, stashed him under a blanket in Vault C, - then boarded a Quinjet posing as May.<eos> - But why?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The Quinjet's transponder went dark outside Aranda de Duero in Spain.<eos> - I'm gonna need a pilot.<eos> - With pleasure.
It was his dog.<eos> Garrett made him kill his dog.<eos> I know what you're doing, Agent Morse, and it's not going to work.<eos> Grant's already told me everything... everything... about his abusive family, about John Garrett, about having to kill Victoria Hand.<eos> But in the end, he overcame his family and the pain Garrett put him through.<eos> He remade himself.<eos> It's why I love him and why no matter what he does, I will always stand with Ward.<eos> Thank you for meeting me, Raina.<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> - Stronger.
She knew I would see this.<eos> She said as much.<eos> She saw who you really are, so you killed her.<eos> Everything I've done, everything I will do is for the protection of our people.<eos> You killed Gonzales.<eos> - You want a war.<eos> - War was inevitable.<eos> I struck first so we would have the advantage.<eos> - He came to make peace!<eos> - Peace?
Phil... time for you to go night-night.<eos> Time for the big sleep.<eos> Time to die.<eos> For everyone in SHIELD to die!<eos> - This is Jiaying's plan, not yours.<eos> - So what?<eos> I've always done whatever she asks.<eos> It makes me happy.<eos> It's why she loves me.<eos> Careful with her.
Are you ready to refocus your energies?<eos> A team centered around people with powers?<eos> How many on the list?<eos> Right now, just you.<eos> We'll take it slow.<eos> - I've thought a lot about it.<eos> - And?<eos> And my mother was right about one thing... people like me need to be kept a secret, not like the Avengers, out in the open.<eos> If we do this, we need to be...<eos> Anonymous.
- Okay. Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Can I have my baby back, please?<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> Yes.<eos> Here.<eos> So, how's it going with your, uh, legal...<eos> Still out on bail.
He will receive the highest standard of care and nothing to add to his lawsuits against this hospital.<eos> Understood.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Oh, and, um, congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - You going on shift?<eos> - Oh, not scheduled.<eos> I'm just trying to catch up today.<eos> Mm. What's your weak spot?<eos> All of it?
Looks something like this.<eos> Well, let's roll up our sleeves.<eos> Well, you guys know what you're doing.<eos> You don't need me for this.<eos> I don't want to crowd up the place.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hexenbiests.<eos> Makes sense, after everything Adalind's done to the both of you.<eos> Yeah. To all of us.
Well, let's roll up our sleeves.<eos> Well, you guys know what you're doing.<eos> You don't need me for this.<eos> I don't want to crowd up the place.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hexenbiests.<eos> Makes sense, after everything Adalind's done to the both of you.<eos> Yeah. To all of us.<eos> Not to me.
So you just come here to just look down on me, huh?<eos> No.<eos> I came here to make some kind of peace between us.<eos> Honey, I was 16 when I had you.<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> I wasn't ready.<eos> But I had my parents to help.<eos> I had my family.<eos> You think I was better off being raised by your God-jabbering mother?<eos> Your lush sister?
-You've seen too many movies. -(Clanking)<eos> It's already done.<eos> It's like a milkman.<eos> That is smart.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> -So Arthur worked as your bodyguard, huh?<eos> -Hmm. But you weren't home last night when he was killed.<eos> -Why wasn't he with you?<eos> -I was at a meeting.<eos> A panther meeting?
Get up.<eos> Fine.<eos> But you won't get any fries with that attitude.<eos> So if I'm being honest, it feels like you're not super happy to see me.<eos> You haven't smiled once since I got here.<eos> Yeah, well, I have a lot on my mind, all right?<eos> Okay, suit yourself.<eos> Hey, you remember that foster family we lived with for, like, ten seconds in Morningside?<eos> You mean the guy with the back hair...<eos> Back hair?
But if you're gonna go back to ignoring me and being angry all the time...<eos> You're right, you're right.<eos> It was wrong of me to behave that way, and it will never happen again.<eos> I'm not looking for a promise to try harder next time.<eos> I'm looking for...<eos> You're cutting me out again.<eos> You know what, forget it.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> Sam, wait.<eos> Please.
Yeah, we can get it.<eos> But if you need it that quick, you're gonna have to come scrounge it up with us.<eos> Wait.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What I mean is you ain't no shot-caller.<eos> You want something, you're gonna have to get your hands dirty like the rest of us.<eos> Yeah, end of your shift is fine.<eos> Kid's going from Ansley to Blair Cosmetic Surgery Clinic in Grant Park.<eos> I can do 400.<eos> Cash.
No, it's not.<eos> It's just...<eos> Too soon?<eos> I get that.<eos> I mean, there are things I'm not ready to talk about either.<eos> What was that for?<eos> Do-over.<eos> Mom, are you okay?<eos> I talked to him.<eos> Ted.
You have a call from inmate Hank Mahoney.<eos> Press one to accept this call.<eos> Alison?<eos> Alison!<eos> Do you usually paint in the dark?<eos> Well, it's easier this way.<eos> I don't bother the students, faculty.<eos> They don't bother me.<eos> Can you help me with this?<eos> This?
Tetsuko.<eos> Money's meant to be spent.<eos> How have you survived all these years?<eos> Money is meant to be spent!<eos> Alice, do you attend Ishinomori Middle?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just like Fu.<eos> Have you heard of the murder?<eos> Huh?<eos> Murder?
I'm sorry!<eos> Please don't hit me!<eos> Who's "Judas"?<eos> Spit it out.<eos> Judas...<eos> Judas was an older student.<eos> That was killed?<eos> Yes!<eos> Killed by who?<eos> By four other Judas.
Hell no!<eos> That was my seat first.<eos> Your seat.<eos> It sucked!<eos> No one would talk to me.<eos> People would call me Judas all the time.<eos> So what do you think I did?<eos> What?<eos> I got Judas to possess me.<eos> In front of everyone.
Hello.<eos> I'm the... exterminator.<eos> Somebody saw a roach.<eos> I have to catch these things before they get out of hand.<eos> Shouldn't your... shouldn't your mother be somewhere nearby?<eos> I-I...<eos> I think I hear her calling you.<eos> Please go away.<eos> Who were you talking to?<eos> A future mafioso.
Must be how they got to Dooley.<eos> And if he can control the chief, we're all at risk.<eos> No.<eos> This time, I'm taking the risk.<eos> This Fennhoff obviously wants to punish me, so... let's give him what he wants.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'll be the bait.<eos> The SSR just needs to set the trap.<eos> Yeah. Something public.<eos> Real showy.
Here's Howard Stark.<eos> Mr. Stark, have all your weapons been recovered?<eos> Is it true that you were hiding at the residence of Barbara Stanwyck?<eos> For too long now, the name Howard Stark has been dragged through the mud.<eos> Today is a day of reckoning for anyone who doubts...<eos> Get down!<eos> Who's got eyes on the shooter?<eos> It's coming from above.<eos> Get him out of here. Police car in the back alley.<eos> - This way.
You want me to stay?<eos> No, I'll be all right.<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> See you in the morning.<eos> Hey, Matt... her loss, man.<eos> Owlsley, Leland: Financial Advisor... at the prestigious firm of Silver Brent...<eos> The funds have been reallocated as requested.<eos> All the arrangements made per your agreement with the guy we're not supposed to blah blah blah.<eos> Business may continue?<eos> In the best possible way... uninterrupted.
No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Put that away.<eos> I don't want your money.<eos> No, I don't take charity.<eos> All right.<eos> You can pay me if you want... with information?<eos> What can I tell you?<eos> A lot, I hope.<eos> I'm working on a legal case...<eos> Oh, yes, yes... with the handsome lawyer.
Put that away.<eos> I don't want your money.<eos> No, I don't take charity.<eos> All right.<eos> You can pay me if you want... with information?<eos> What can I tell you?<eos> A lot, I hope.<eos> I'm working on a legal case...<eos> Oh, yes, yes... with the handsome lawyer.<eos> Yeah, um, Matt.
I don't want your money.<eos> No, I don't take charity.<eos> All right.<eos> You can pay me if you want... with information?<eos> What can I tell you?<eos> A lot, I hope.<eos> I'm working on a legal case...<eos> Oh, yes, yes... with the handsome lawyer.<eos> Yeah, um, Matt.<eos> No, Mr. Foggy.
- Mmm-hmm.<eos> Hoffman was able to spin it.<eos> Told everyone he was assaulted by the man in the mask, then he finished what he started with Blake.<eos> So we're not exposed on that front.<eos> Well, let's have a parade.<eos> This guy, Hoffman, how much does he know?<eos> We're taking care of it, Leland.<eos> Well, that fills me with warm comfort.<eos> Situation's being handled, all right.<eos> Just not by you.
But...<eos> I have heard Leland... is equally displeased.<eos> It's under control.<eos> How do you think... I knew where you live, Wilson?<eos> This is one of your most guarded secrets, yes?<eos> The king in his castle.<eos> Did I divine the location from bones and spells, chanted beneath the moonlight?<eos> No.<eos> I discovered it because... you have become sloppy.<eos> And emotional.
One that survived the years, because it's true.<eos> For the most part.<eos> But not for everyone.<eos> Some get more than they deserve.<eos> Because they believe they aren't like everyone else.<eos> That the rules, the ones people like me and you, the people that work and struggle to live our lives, just live, don't apply to them.<eos> That they can do anything and live happily ever after, while the rest of us suffer.<eos> They do this from the shadows.<eos> Shadows that we cast.<eos> With our indifference.
You've lied to me, Matt, since the day we met.<eos> What did you expect me to say, Foggy?<eos> "Hi, I'm Matt.<eos> I got some chemicals splashed in my eyes when I was a kid that gave me heightened senses."<eos> Well, maybe not lead with that.<eos> I didn't even tell my dad after it happened.<eos> But you told that nurse, Claire.<eos> Because I didn't have a choice.<eos> She found me in a dumpster, all right?<eos> Half dead.
We're gonna have big, fancy offices one day, with steel and glass and chairs you don't even know how to sit in.<eos> Murdock and Nelson, attorneys at law!<eos> Nelson and Murdock. Sounds better.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Yeah, trust me.<eos> I can't see worth shit, but my hearing's spectacular.<eos> Me and you, pal...<eos> We're gonna do this.<eos> We're gonna be the best damn avocados this city has ever seen.<eos> Best damn avocados.
Look, I still say you should've let me bring my .45.<eos> Yeah, right, after your thing in Douglasville?<eos> Okay, I told you, Gretchen, that was not my fault.<eos> Dude came at me.<eos> He was on frickin' crutches, Jed, and you stole his beer.<eos> Listen, just do not pull that shit here.<eos> So what am I supposed to do, just stand here?<eos> Jed, yes, just stand there and look like someone this guy doesn't want to mess with.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Morning, Seth.
You'll thank me later.<eos> What good's saving the world, Harry, if we can't enjoy it?<eos> Welcome to the human race.<eos> Put the good news is, you're not alone.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Ready for that code?<eos> The stock market has suddenly begun to stabilize and even slowly tick up after a wild afternoon of trading.<eos> This brings back memories.<eos> I used to work on old cars as a boy.<eos> With your father.
I know, I know.<eos> But there must be coconut in it because my vagina swelled up which Greg actually really liked, but then we did other stuff and my throat closed up.<eos> Okay, now your mouth's gonna close up.<eos> And you, young lady?<eos> I actually used it on myself, and I agree.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Oh, you are so full of shit. You did not use it on yourself.<eos> Why?<eos> Who'd you use it with?<eos> Uh, my friend Eric and then my ex John and then Eric again.
Okay.<eos> So... you really like me?<eos> I think I do.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh...<eos> - Anything else?<eos> - Count me in for fish!<eos> - Oh, we said no more surprise visits.<eos> - This is the last one, I swear to God.<eos> Which God?
You know what, don't give me that shit.<eos> You love being busy and overworked.<eos> You thrive on it, and it makes you feel more important than the rest of us mortals, but I'm pretty tired of it, and it does not give you the right to be an asshole.<eos> Wow!<eos> Well, I'm glad you're such an expert on what it's like to be me.<eos> But who's being judgmental now?<eos> - Ooh, dinner!<eos> - Brianna, how are you?<eos> Mom, I got this.<eos> On an angle, right?
What I'm hearing is, "Stay where you are with the doors closed."<eos> Look at foxy Dr. Paul.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I don't see myself doing that.<eos> Why not?<eos> Mom, I do it.<eos> I mean, I've met some pretty passable guys.<eos> One of them had a micro-penis, but the rest were absolutely normal.<eos> Yeah, and yet here you are "getting bonkers"<eos> - with your mother on Saturday night.
With just one week to go before the Iowa caucuses, the latest Gallup poll has Dunbar ahead by six points, 45 to 39, with 16 percent still undecided.<eos> That's a lot of undecideds so close to election day.<eos> Dunbar has incredibly high favorability numbers here, much higher than President Underwood's, but I have spoken with many Iowans who have doubts about her lack of experience and whether she'll be able to stand up to a Republican candidate<eos> with a substantial record.
You haven't been, not for 10 years.<eos> Now, why should things be different?<eos> 'Cause I saw the people you killed for Foster, and it took me 10 years to understand why.<eos> That faith you have in him?<eos> Look, maybe I don't deserve that faith... but neither does Foster.<eos> This isn't necessary.<eos> Colonel, we were just looking for Samuel's stuffed rabbit.<eos> Yeah, I'm familiar with it?<eos> I'm the one that gave it to him, right?<eos> Along with a home.
You really don't get it, do you?<eos> This is about the music.<eos> What's up?<eos> I mean, it's really nice for some Girl Scouts.<eos> But this ain't about being nice.<eos> You've got to go hard with this.<eos> Come harder.<eos> All right, let me hear the beat again.<eos> I got something for you.<eos> Hakeem
You can't save Cole unless you take Foster's deal.<eos> Mr. Ramse, I promise you we'll find a solution, but now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.<eos> Maybe he's right.<eos> We make a deal to use the core.<eos> Maybe then we can convince Foster.<eos> Foster's deal is just a window into our eventual servitude.<eos> Then what do we do?<eos> We take their core.<eos> Take it how?<eos> By any means necessary.
So our friend here went full vigilante.<eos> Batman versus the Candyman.<eos> Point Candyman.<eos> And I assume that fight solved everything.<eos> You and the Candyman shook hands, and he led you right to Jerome.<eos> He knows something.<eos> I know it.<eos> You're a social worker, not a cop. You could've been killed.<eos> I was an all-conference strong safety for the Washington Huskies, baby.<eos> A head-hunter.
Alas, it was sometimes unavoidable.<eos> - Do it, and I'll take Jane with me.<eos> - No.<eos> _<eos> Oh, no, she's not.<eos> I'm her mother!<eos> We'll leave tomorrow.<eos> Luckily, Jane had her writing to help her navigate these difficult moments.<eos> - It's a letter, you see, which she would slip under her grandmother's door late at night.<eos> And then, in the morning...
- No problem. - Uh...<eos> Let's just... can we... ?<eos> Can we talk about this later?<eos> _<eos> El presidente, uh... _<eos> _<eos> Note that Jane had hurried to the stage so she could watch them film the scene idea she had come up with.<eos> Santos disguised as a beggar.<eos> _<eos> A pirate beggar?
And remember, I knew dad pretty well.<eos> And what I remember...<eos> What he wanted most, more than anything, was for you to be happy.<eos> Look... (Laughs) you don't have to date the Exercycle guy, but maybe just be open to the idea of an Exercycle guy, okay?<eos> (Sniffles)<eos> (Clears throat)<eos> (Sighs)<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> What?<eos> With the amnio.
I'll get to it, then.<eos> Since you've left, our ratings have plummeted.<eos> Have they?<eos> Rogelio, you've tweeted about it.<eos> Extensively.<eos> What is your point?<eos> We want you back.<eos> I happen to be very happy here at Galactica.<eos> It's quite a challenge to act only with your face...<eos> - and hair.
I don't think it cut too deep.<eos> I'm not talking about that.<eos> You know, I've been with the 7 for a long time... since I was 13.<eos> A lot of days like today, and, um... that sort of thing, it can get to you... after a while.<eos> - 13, huh?<eos> - Mm.<eos> Isn't that when your dad...<eos> Yeah.<eos> When he was killed.<eos> By scavs.
Just... just drifting... in the ocean of time.<eos> No shore in sight.<eos> You tell me the truth... this gonna happen to Cole?<eos> I won't let it happen.<eos> It matters.<eos> Matters what we do here.<eos> This time.<eos> ? All them Markridge boys a-comin' with their guns ?<eos> ? All them Markridge boys a-comin' ?<eos> ? with their clipboards and their guns ?
We could just...<eos> Be us...<eos> Just for a minute.<eos> Cassie.<eos> - I'm gonna fix this, okay?<eos> - I know.<eos> What do you think will happen when this is over?<eos> I know you say that the future will be saved and that you won't exist, but...<eos> What do you think happens...<eos> To you?
I started getting the feeling that someone was watching me, and sometimes I still do.<eos> And about a month after Martin disappeared, that young man showed up here.<eos> What happened to me?<eos> A month...<eos> A month.<eos> Clarissa.<eos> Clarissa.<eos> Who are you?<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> Under the loose stone.
They both feel the need to protect the women they love.<eos> Clarissa said she feels like she's being watched.<eos> Well, then, this has all the makings of a stakeout.<eos> But Barry's got a date tonight.<eos> I'll cancel.<eos> No!<eos> No, go.<eos> If we need you here, something tells me we can get you back in a hurry.<eos> I'm not picking up anything.<eos> Not even with The Super Light.
Yo, this trickster guy just posted a vlog.<eos> You gotta see this.<eos> I'm sending you the link right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Denizens of Central City, Or those of you who remain, Welcome to boom day.<eos> I'm very proud to report that my first trick Was an exploding success.<eos> Show him.<eos> But I think you all deserve Something much, uh, bigger.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - So for my next trick...
Right.<eos> I wouldn't worry too much about what the cops might do to you.<eos> Really?<eos> If the police aren't able to find you, Trust me, The Flash will.<eos> Here's hoping.<eos> So what's next?<eos> In your last letter, you said you had something big In mind for when you got out.<eos> I've had 20 years to come up with the perfect trick.<eos> It's going to be my masterpiece.<eos> My Mona Lisa.
And I always knew he was lying, but I would help him anyway.<eos> - You know why? - Hmm?<eos> Because I knew Oliver was a good person with a good heart.<eos> And Cisco and Caitlin?<eos> They're no different.<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> So you're really staying here tonight?<eos> Tonight.<eos> Tomorrow night.<eos> The night after that.
Mom!<eos> And get justice for my father.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on The Flash...<eos> The night we trapped the Reverse-Flash in the force field, there's no reason that the containment system should have failed.<eos> - I've been having these dreams.<eos> - What happens in the dream?<eos> Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash, and he kills me.<eos> If this is Dr. Wells, then who have we been working for this whole time?<eos> A completely different person.
I was running to try and stop a tsunami from hitting the city...<eos> When was that?<eos> A few weeks ago.<eos> Right before you started getting those dreams.<eos> Oh, you mean the ones where Wells uses his super-speeding hand to shred apart my heart?<eos> - Those?<eos> - Yes, right.<eos> So, what if they're not dreams?<eos> What else could they be?<eos> Memories.
You know what I can do.<eos> You want to kill me, go ahead.<eos> I'm not gonna fight you.<eos> But just tell the police what you did.<eos> Get my dad out of prison.<eos> I don't want to kill you, Barry.<eos> I need you.<eos> And...<eos> I also did not anticipate, as difficult as the past 15 years have been for me, how much I would come to love working with you.<eos> With all of you.
Previously on The Flash:<eos> The Man in the Yellow, he took Eddie.<eos> Hi, Barry.<eos> Or should I say the Flash?<eos> Observe, Barry marries Iris and not you.<eos> - I've been having dreams.<eos> - What happens?<eos> Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash and he kills me.<eos> If this is Dr. Wells, then who have we been working for this whole time?<eos> A completely different person.
Um, well, you know, all that's important is that we're all safe and back together, right?<eos> Eddie, Why'd he take you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He said that we're family. Said his real name is Eobard Thawne.<eos> Eobard Thawne. It's just like in my dream.<eos> Did he say anything else?<eos> I mean, anything that could help us figure out what he's really after?<eos> He didn't say much.<eos> Just kept working on some tube.<eos> A tube?
Beer? Food?<eos> Pickled eggs here are fantastic.<eos> No, I'm good. I need your help with a problem.<eos> Must be pretty desperate to come asking for my assistance, but I'll bite.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Help transporting some people out of the city.<eos> How many?<eos> Five.<eos> Five very bad, very angry people who have powers.<eos> Powers, hmm?
And now I am no longer needed?<eos> How dare he?<eos> Maybe it's the jetlag.<eos> It's a test.<eos> A test?<eos> Yes.<eos> God is putting us through a final test.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Something has happened to the boy.<eos> Mm. Just like the first Josh.
Now tell me where I find Claire.<eos> Or do I have to follow you around everywhere?<eos> Yeah, give it a go.<eos> Here's my number.<eos> You tell her to call me.<eos> Sorry about your health.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Someone said you were sick.<eos> Over a little further.<eos> Careful with those.
Do both of you understand how a prosecution case is built in court?<eos> It's my responsibility to prove your husband's guilt beyond doubt.<eos> And I do this by building a wall of evidence, in front of the jury, brick by brick.<eos> Each piece of evidence is a new brick.<eos> When it's built, the wall is unassailable.<eos> ~ Right.<eos> ~ Some bricks are more important than others.<eos> Cornerstones, for example.<eos> A confession by the accused.<eos> Absolutely crucial.
He was a good boy.<eos> Someone has to speak for him.<eos> Where were you on the night that Daniel Latimer was murdered, Mr Miller?<eos> I was at home in bed with my wife.<eos> ~ Did you have any contact with Daniel Latimer the previous morning?<eos> ~ No.<eos> ~ Did you send him a text message when you returned from holiday?<eos> ~ No.<eos> We have your phone records which show that a text message was sent from your phone.<eos> ~ Not by me.
~ I don't know.<eos> ~ How did you get to the hut that night?<eos> ~ I didn't go to the hut.<eos> ~ What did you use to clean the hut?<eos> ~ I didn't clean the hut.<eos> Why did you decide to move Danny's body from the murder scene?<eos> I wasn't...<eos> I didn't move it at all.<eos> I hadn't seen him for days, weeks... ~ Is it days or is it weeks?<eos> ~ Weeks.
Ricky and Cate Gillespie said Pippa always used to like going next door to see Lee.<eos> If Ashworth was in their house, there must've been forensics.<eos> Yeah, there were.<eos> Ashworth's DNA was all over the place.<eos> ~ A strand of his hair was found on Pippa's pillow.<eos> ~ What was his argument?<eos> That he'd been in the house plenty of times, which is true, but... he still wouldn't say how the hair got on the pillow.<eos> At one stage, he said it had been put there to frame him.<eos> By who?<eos> This...
Off you go.<eos> How many men have you slept with since I left?<eos> None.<eos> ~ Are you sure?<eos> ~ I think I'd remember.<eos> ~ What about you?<eos> ~ Same.<eos> ~ Really?<eos> No sex with any men.<eos> And women?
~ Are you medically qualified?<eos> ~ It was obvious what had happened.<eos> Why didn't you call the police?<eos> I didn't want to dump Nigel in it.<eos> How do you explain police forensics finding four cigarette butts with your DNA on them next to Danny's body?<eos> I've smoked a lot of cigarettes on that beach.<eos> ~ Why did you take the skateboard?<eos> ~ I thought it might get nicked.<eos> It did get nicked, didn't it?<eos> By you!
~ I wasn't sure you'd come.<eos> ~ I can't believe you asked.<eos> Anyway, I never miss a chance to be belittled.<eos> ~ I want to work with you.<eos> ~ You wanna what?<eos> I'm not ready to stop.<eos> In fact I'm just getting going again.<eos> ~ You don't want to end on a loss.<eos> ~ No, I bloody don't,<eos> ~ and especially not to you.
Go.<eos> Now.<eos> Why?<eos> So these men can kill Carmine Falcone?<eos> I have no knowledge of that!<eos> Go.<eos> That's an order.<eos> You're a disgrace, Loeb.<eos> I hope to see you behind bars very soon.<eos> Or dead.
You loved me when I didn't deserve it.<eos> You saw my inner beauty, past all my outer beauty.<eos> Give me another chance.<eos> I mean, if you still have feelings.<eos> I mean, I don't know if...<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> - Pull it together!<eos> - I've moved on.<eos> - Oh, yeah, with who?<eos> With me.
- I knew it.<eos> God, I miss college.<eos> I just moved in, and we are crazy about each other.<eos> And we mouth kiss all the time.<eos> And it feels right.<eos> This... is my new type.<eos> Well, then maybe you should know, the other night, she kissed me.<eos> How dare you?<eos> I forgive you.<eos> Okay.
Oh, that's too bad because it's my house, my rules.<eos> House trumps van.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> You can't just change the rules.<eos> Well, that is a valid point, but, uh, tough crap.<eos> This isn't fair.<eos> We paid for it.<eos> - Paid for it!<eos> - With our own money.<eos> - Money!
And whatever you tell me, I will say I found out some other way.<eos> And if this guy goes down for some other murders and not your wife's, for a man like you that served justice his entire life, isn't that a damn sight better than him not going down at all?<eos> Now, I do not care what you and your wife got into.<eos> In fact, honestly, I think it's great that you found each other.<eos> Kindred spirits.<eos> Personally... I would give anything for that myself.<eos> And if I were you, I would avenge her.<eos> Hispanic.<eos> Mexican, maybe.<eos> In his 20s.
He's here, and he's in some trouble that I can't fix.<eos> He's AWOL, and...<eos> you want what from me?<eos> Your connections, someone high up enough to grant immunity in exchange for classified documents detailing illegal actions by the U.S. government.<eos> And quickly, because Walt wants to go to the press.<eos> So...<eos> he's a radical?<eos> Mm... I don't think he is.<eos> I think being over there did something to him.<eos> - To his mind.
- Because I'm sad.<eos> Because you're lying!<eos> No.<eos> Because anything I do, everything I am, is for you, Charlie.<eos> Why is it a bad thing, huh, to love you?<eos> To be your wife, your child, your lieutenant?<eos> - You used to call me...<eos> - Do not make me do it again!<eos> And what did you do to that girl?<eos> [laughing] That sweet, sweet girl.
Because you're lying!<eos> No.<eos> Because anything I do, everything I am, is for you, Charlie.<eos> Why is it a bad thing, huh, to love you?<eos> To be your wife, your child, your lieutenant?<eos> - You used to call me...<eos> - Do not make me do it again!<eos> And what did you do to that girl?<eos> [laughing] That sweet, sweet girl.<eos> Your favorite girl.
These tattoos.<eos> I've discovered in my research that certain tattoo artists are quite particular about which inks they use.<eos> And Cryers #2 Vermillion is very rare.<eos> So rare, in fact, that I was able to identify Briscoe's artist.<eos> Okay, but what does that have to do with the jar of ink that Winthrop sent us?<eos> Briscoe's artist lives in Seattle.<eos> He has an ex-wife who moved to Vegas last year to live with her twin sister.<eos> Henry found blood on the Castor and Pollux statuette consistent with identical twins.<eos> Unknown females.<eos> Not unknown now.
No one answered.<eos> Amelia Vance,<eos> LVPD.<eos> Another processed crime scene.<eos> Strings and blood suggest two events.<eos> Two victims.<eos> Again, he took the bodies.<eos> Russell's theory was right.<eos> Winthrop and his brother have become one.<eos> Dead ringers.
My name is Julie Finlay.<eos> I work with the Las Vegas Police Department.<eos> Uh, I need to speak with your granddaughter, Amy.<eos> It's about her dad.<eos> What'd you get?<eos> So, Collin Winthrop had extensive HD surveillance at his house, all over the property.<eos> I mean, it's no surprise that cameras caught Paul Winthrop in his guesthouse, but... this is what I wanted you to see.<eos> That's Collin Winthrop, right?<eos> Who's he arguing with?<eos> Our friend, Brother Larson.
I think this is it. This is where it all started.<eos> We found it.<eos> Good for us.<eos> Listen, this is the only connection we have to Peters.<eos> I need you to help me find him, Cassie.<eos> It'll be my pleasure.<eos> I don't think that's helping you.<eos> If Peters is recreating M5-10 for the 12 Monkeys, he'll need animals to test it on.<eos> CDC can get a list of suppliers, and then I'll be able to track him down.<eos> Just like the Big Burn and the Night Room.
You can go back and save your mother.<eos> You can prevent your father from going to prison.<eos> You can reunite the Allen family.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't believe you.<eos> I want to kill you right now.<eos> I know that rage.<eos> I used to feel that rage every time I looked upon you.<eos> And now, somehow, I know what Joe and Henry feel when they look on you with pride.<eos> With love.
You won't ever lose me.<eos> Ever, you hear me?<eos> Ever.<eos> Wow, slow news day?<eos> If they only knew, right?<eos> I thought you would be at S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> I was.<eos> Then I got hungry, so I went to Mama Chows.<eos> For dim sum?<eos> Your favorite.
A pretty big coincidence, actually.<eos> About a year and a half ago, I had a date with this girl.<eos> Katie Rogers.<eos> She was a dancer.<eos> We had plans to meet at Mama Chows, but she texted me.<eos> She pulled a hamstring and had to cancel.<eos> Oh, those fragile dancers.<eos> I was bummed 'cause I was looking forward to it.<eos> So I had dinner by myself, and I was walking home when I saw a mugger running with a stolen backpack.<eos> Your backpack.
- Okay. So let's prove us all right and find a way to find Marty Mar $10 million before lunch.<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> Mm. Okay, Doug, spit it out.<eos> What do you have?<eos> Say it. Look, it's just an option, but hear me out.<eos> Uh, our old exterminator client, Rat Man?<eos> Well, he's got a-a QVC line of organic poisons out now, and it's a big hit with the stay-at-home mom set, so we have an in.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Oh, come on. I cannot be the only one who's seen those commercials.<eos> With the little rats and their...
Hey, Doug.<eos> Um... so just a heads up, the word is that you slept with Clyde last night.<eos> I know, just office gossip. Vicious.<eos> "Good afternoon, Kelsey.<eos> "I like your makeup.<eos> "Most girls can't pull off a day-friendly winged eyeliner, but you really make it work."<eos> So, did you or did you not?<eos> I did.<eos> My God, you should have come to me first.<eos> For tips?
Well, they're not deciding shit without us, so I wouldn't worry about it.<eos> Their commanding officer owns 60% of K and A, Marty.<eos> Denna can technically do whatever the fuck she wants.<eos> I was just under the assumption that you two had an understanding about the roll that she would play.<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> Okay, so nip it in the bud, Marty.<eos> Call your girlfriend, set her straight.<eos> Jeannie, Denna grubstaked K and A as an investment, not a favor.<eos> I don't need to check in with Mommy on how to run my company.<eos> Our company.
I mean, that's why I've been pushing y'all so hard.<eos> I was so proud of y'all tonight.<eos> Who knows this?<eos> Vernon,<eos> Becky... and, uh, Anika, of course.<eos> Well, the IPO-- we...<eos> we have to have a plan.<eos> He's dying and you're worrying about a IPO?<eos> Yo, I should knock you...<eos> Hakeem!
Stop! Whoa!<eos> Whoa! Crazy lady!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> Officer, please, help!<eos> Officer, they're gonna kill him!<eos> What happened?<eos> A guy hit a girl, but it was an accident.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Okay, right around the corner, right over there.<eos> Right around the corner.
Captain.<eos> The I.A. guy's on his way.<eos> Good.<eos> It looks like the photographer's almost finished, so...<eos> Hey, uh, are you busy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Uh... it's kind of a personal emergency.<eos> Something happen to you?<eos> No, to your condo.
My mother keeps Tino's information taped to the wall above her phone, so that's where I got his address from, but I've never been there.<eos> Look, I'm not saying that I didn't rough him up, okay?<eos> She's recovering from back surgery, and this Tino jerk was supposed to be watching her.<eos> Instead, he was drunk, and he was ripping her off.<eos> Look, if he wants to file a complaint, okay, fine.<eos> But it was personal.<eos> Did you...<eos> When you were fighting, did you... did you hit him with anything?<eos> No.<eos> Like a brick or a board?
Let me ask the questions.<eos> This picture, where was it taken?<eos> Fuck, man, I don't remember.<eos> You and your boys ever skate up in Laurel Canyon?<eos> No, man, we were miracle mile...<eos> Wilshire boys.<eos> Somebody took this picture, and Arthur Delacroix's father knew your name when he saw your face.<eos> He said Arthur looked up to you?<eos> Where'd this kid live?<eos> Off Wilshire...
Ma.<eos> Go on.<eos> Wish your friends a merry Christmas for me.<eos> I will.<eos> And don't stay out too late.<eos> I won't.<eos> I'll lock the back door.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Joyeux fetes. Right, Ma.<eos> Merry Christmas.
Hey, Kiz, any luck with that passport check?<eos> Nothing.<eos> If Waits ever went to France, it was under another name.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Bosch.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - When'd you get in?<eos> - This morning.
If Waits ever went to France, it was under another name.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Bosch.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - When'd you get in?<eos> - This morning.<eos> This is from Maddie.<eos> Merry Christmas.
-For you mean I mean.<eos> -Yes.<eos> We'll let her go and I'll take responsibility for it, okay?<eos> Yes, but it's up to you.<eos> -So, I can leave?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Okay?<eos> -It's one of those magazine bins.<eos> Behind the kiosk in Hogdalen.<eos> Under it.
I know you've been chasing the Givens property.<eos> I know he turned you down. We'll have the Givens' property soon enough... And yours, too.<eos> How that comes to pass depends entirely on you.<eos> Now, I'm gonna tell you something, and I want you to listen.<eos> There ain't no version of this story that ends with us selling this house to some peacock.<eos> What did you call me?<eos> You heard me.<eos> Peacock?<eos> I come here in peace, try to change your lives, and you call me a peacock?<eos> A goddamn peacock.
- She's just testing you.<eos> - Christ, I have to get out of here!<eos> The more I think about it, the better it sounds.<eos> The bluegrass state has some of the most lonely soil in the union.<eos> Weed used to grow so big here, old timers called it "Christmas tree dope. "<eos> Hell, before it all got legalized, our people were growing hemp for the whole country.<eos> You remember those stories?<eos> This morning we were fixin' to leave.<eos> - Now you want to be a farmer.<eos> - Not a farmer, an entrepreneur.
Cool.<eos> - Should we take Noah?<eos> - God, no.<eos> He'd be like a four-year-old at Disneyland. - We'd have to put a leash on him.<eos> - Fair point.<eos> He can watch the highlight reel.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - What's that about?<eos> - That was the City Attorney. Riley Marra's family wants to file a civil case against Lakewood, naming me the lead screw-up.<eos> Not the official term.
Yeah, the charm is wearing off.<eos> Emma, what are you doing?<eos> Oh, my God, that's Nina's laptop.<eos> What?<eos> The police have been looking for this.<eos> I bet.<eos> Folders for all her friends?<eos> Maybe photos?<eos> Was she friends with the Mayor?<eos> Principal Showalter?
I sense an unholy alliance.<eos> Okay. So, before I say what I have to say...<eos> How hot is your coffee?<eos> Well, it's coffee, so it's hot.<eos> So...<eos> Okay, so...<eos> Freshman year, before we were friends...<eos> You were this pristine Pollyanna type.<eos> And Nina thought you needed to be taken down a peg.<eos> So, one day at lunch,
Yeah, all charm one second, then deadly the next.<eos> It's just like in The Faculty. Alien parasites turn the high school teachers into murderous body snatchers.<eos> I hadn't actually considered that possibility.<eos> Because you're not insane.<eos> It's wishful thinking. There are worse ways to go than being body-snatched by Famke Janssen.<eos> _<eos> Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.<eos> Uh, no, it's okay.<eos> Whatcha working on?<eos> Uh, just a research project.
If it re-creates this in other cities, countless people will suffer.<eos> Right now, I only care about one person, Harold.<eos> I'm gonna take first swing at this.<eos> All right?<eos> You get ten minutes.<eos> I'm warning you, the police will come looking for me.<eos> I wouldn't bet on it.<eos> I'd introduce myself, but you already know us.<eos> What did you do with Sameen?<eos> Who?
The RAC handbook doesn't really cover your partner going all senseless killing machine on you, especially after they had a tumble in the old space bunk.<eos> - Oh...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - It's... it's old news.<eos> Oh, thank the Trees!<eos> Um... great stuff, keep doing what you're doing, - no heavy lifting. - Uh...<eos> Pawter...<eos> Pawter!<eos> Whoa, whoa! Hey, Red, where do you think you're going?<eos> Medical supplies.
Well, I got a man upstairs with an emergency beacon ringing loud and clear. You're going to want to stay down here.<eos> An extraction team is on the way.<eos> Wait!<eos> If they see uniforms, they'll start killing hostages.<eos> - Not your warrant, not your problem.<eos> - I gave my word.<eos> Let me go back in there for you.<eos> I have a better shot at ending this without any more bloodshed.<eos> He's really good at fixing things.<eos> OK, Killjoy.
Why don't you call it a day?<eos> Unless you have the urge to make me lunch, -Or do my laundry.<eos> -You wish.<eos> Have you really not eaten lunch?<eos> Please let this conversation end With you cutting the crusts off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.<eos> That's not funny.<eos> Are you really hungry, though, seriously?<eos> I think i'm done for the day.<eos> But you should eat something.<eos> Possibly with vegetables.
-Or chelsea.<eos> Why do i have a sudden urge to dump tea into a harbor?<eos> What's she talking about?<eos> Colonist propaganda.<eos> Pay her no mind, we have zombie tests to conduct.<eos> Shall we?<eos> I assume you're employing koch's postulates in trying to determine Whether we're dealing with a neurotropic virus Or perhaps some kind of bacterial pathogen.<eos> And what the hell am i talking about?<eos> I thought you were a musician...<eos> Apparently one with quite the keen scientific mind.
You were the angel General Washington claimed he saw.<eos> His men thought he'd lost his mind.<eos> The Horseman killed Corbin.<eos> A whole cell of Masons.<eos> How long before he puts you and I in the ground?<eos> For real?<eos> I faced a mighty foe on the field of battle.<eos> He came at me with an axe that glowed with the fires of hell.<eos> And I fought my best, but he got the upper hand.<eos> An axe?
We share a mission, but we also swore to share a life together.<eos> You did not attempt to reach me with logic or fairness last night.<eos> Rather, you used our marriage as a bargaining tool.<eos> I simply wanted you to support me, believe in me.<eos> Is that so wrong?<eos> When have I not, Katrina?<eos> Henry is our son.<eos> Our blood.<eos> Abraham was my friend.<eos> And your fiancé.
I did.<eos> His pride.<eos> His ego.<eos> Anger.<eos> Our past... weighs so heavily upon us, Katrina.<eos> As Miss Mills and I have redefined our role as Witness, so you and I must redefine our marriage.<eos> If we are to give life to our marriage why not start today?<eos> One small step at a time.<eos> So things are still upside-down on the home front?<eos> Mm, sideways.
Son of a whore.<eos> Half-blood.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> I want one of those, man.<eos> Our time will come.<eos> What a ride.<eos> It's Kalpa's Lamborghini.<eos> No way.<eos> I know him from school, he was a loser.<eos> A nerd.
You're crazy, bro.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> You grab her by the hips and slowly make your way to her mouth.<eos> You start using your tongue.<eos> You grab her ass, you whisper in her ear.<eos> She starts giggling.<eos> Get it?<eos> You lick her neck and keep using your tongue.<eos> Do you get it?<eos> Nice and slowly with your tongue.
He was the face, and I got it done.<eos> Must be frustrating, Grady getting all the glory.<eos> Well... taking his partner as my lover made it a little easier.<eos> - Avery Markham.<eos> - Best lover I had ever had.<eos> Still is.<eos> Nevertheless, I know he ratted out Grady and was responsible for all that ensued, down to me pulling vindictive, low-class, little stunts in a jewelry store.<eos> Smart of you, though, sleeping with him.<eos> Can't imagine he'd suspect the man trying to rob him is the woman underneath him.<eos> Not always underneath him.
Today, it is also quite early Ok<eos> This is in preparation for tomorrow's banquet<eos> Oh yeah, tomorrow ah<eos> Legation people will come seems like it<eos> Speaking recently how about Mr. Pesh<eos> He returned to Poland a is it<eos> If only he could safely will be good<eos> He should not come back<eos> And I can dance with you<eos> Extremely happy
Cobalt Lane.<eos> You work this late so you can return calls without actually reaching people.<eos> Well, I reached you.<eos> - I received your message.<eos> - So cut a check.<eos> And I also received a call from Spheeris' attorney.<eos> Spheeris claims you, and I quote, "lifted his car overhead and threatened him with your laser eyes."<eos> Pathetic.<eos> - Did you threaten him?<eos> - Yep, with my laser eyes.
It's like a conspiracy.<eos> I'm working.<eos> - What if the apology didn't work?<eos> - Then I'll deal with it.<eos> Look, I'm with a client right now.<eos> Sort of.<eos> How can you trust any client after what happened with Hope's parents?<eos> I don't, which is why I've been following her since dawn.<eos> Following who?<eos> A jealous wife.
I don't know, I just had to drive Kilgrave to meet the same guy every day at 10:00 a.m. on the dot.<eos> - He was very punctual.<eos> - What did he look like?<eos> Is this some kind of reenactment therapy?<eos> Screw therapy.<eos> What did he look like, the guy he met?<eos> Well, I never got close, and it was freezing.<eos> Everyone's wrapped in tons of layers and hats.<eos> He wore a scarf.<eos> Blue and white stripes.
Help me find him, Jones.<eos> Keep the money.<eos> I owe you a favor.<eos> I didn't ask for a favor.<eos> Text me any information you have on Antoine, phone number, address.<eos> I went by his place already.<eos> He's not there.<eos> -I'll take another look.<eos> -Tonight?<eos> First thing tomorrow.
I mean, you can't be serious.<eos> Why don't you tell him how serious I am, Jeri?<eos> Or do you want to send in your private eye to threaten me again?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Who threatened you?<eos> Do you want to tell everyone, or do you want to revise the agreement?<eos> I didn't send anyone, Wendy.<eos> I fell in love with someone else.<eos> That doesn't make me a monster.<eos> No, not a monster.
You know what?<eos> We're gonna make it stop.<eos> I'm gonna call the police right now and we're gonna make it stop.<eos> They'll arrest me.<eos> You didn't do it and the evidence will confirm that.<eos> This is the third death that I'm directly connected to.<eos> I'm so sorry, Ruben.<eos> I'm gonna end it.<eos> End what?<eos> Yourself?
Was "Murdercorpse" already taken?<eos> You have feelings for me, Jessica.<eos> If you didn't, I'd be dead.<eos> There are worse things than death.<eos> Don't be melodramatic.<eos> Like being the slave to a sociopathic killer.<eos> I've never killed anyone.<eos> Can you say the same?<eos> If you wanna build trust, start by admitting what you did.<eos> To me, to Hope, to Ruben...
Not like those sods at Liverpool.<eos> They'll pick your pocket...<eos> The study I'm looking for had to do with kids.<eos> Experiments on them.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I just need the names of the professors.<eos> They're gone and they should stay gone.<eos> They skipped town in '88 with some grant money.<eos> The program was aborted and I was in no way associated with them.<eos> With who?
I've made my decision.<eos> I just thought that you should know.<eos> I've got him, Hope.<eos> What?<eos> Kilgrave is my prisoner.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean, I pumped him full of drugs and I dumped him in a cage.<eos> We are so close to having the proof we need for reasonable doubt.<eos> Hope... do not let him off the hook for what he did to you.<eos> To us.
Yeah, I guess I could use a break.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I'm checking on a patient, Will Simpson.<eos> I doubt he's conscious.<eos> Simpson here.<eos> You sound... all right.<eos> I told you, Kozlov was the guy.<eos> And I wanted to see you again.<eos> Are you with Jessica?<eos> With him?
But I didn't really see what happened.<eos> I saw it all.<eos> Every single detail.<eos> I knew she killed her parents, but, uh... she seemed like a nice girl.<eos> She said that she wanted some company... after everything.<eos> It's all etched into my brain.<eos> Forever.<eos> I guess what she really wanted was an audience to watch her die.<eos> She killed herself.<eos> With a glass.
Breaking and entering, my specialty.<eos> As well as punching, kickin', drinkin' and talkin' shit.<eos> The four essentials of being a P.I.<eos> Not closed.<eos> - Come back later?<eos> - I got other specialties.<eos> We're closed.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> New York State Liquor Authority.<eos> Undercover.
I want you to know, I forgive you for everything.<eos> I'll say it every day for as long as you need to hear it.<eos> You heard that?<eos> I wrote it!<eos> Surprise!<eos> Mr. Cage had been ordered to ring me about your exploits since before he blew up his seedy little bar.<eos> Uh, the 12-hour window at that point was actually 16 hours.<eos> Now it's 24... and a hundred yards.<eos> Did you think he was more powerful than me?<eos> With his unbreakable skin?
don't need powers to be of use.<eos> I don't want powers.<eos> I mean, I do not want to be on the receiving end of them either, but...<eos> I don't know, I just- - I like people too much.<eos> Luke, Jessica, just by necessity, by definition, they're separate.<eos> Even from each other.<eos> Maybe that's what they need most from us.<eos> Connection.<eos> What does that make us?<eos> Sidekicks?
Can I get a cup of coffee?<eos> Sure.<eos> I like the name,<eos> "Cracked Mug."<eos> It feels right for this neighborhood.<eos> Cracked but still here.<eos> Yeah, just like me.<eos> Me too.<eos> So, have you owned other coffeehouses before?<eos> No, not coffeehouses, but other businesses.
Do you know what it means... that her family sat Shiva for her?<eos> I as much as killed someone, Maggie.<eos> So, don't you dare think this has anything to do with you, okay?<eos> This is my life, it's my burden, and you will never understand.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> Neshema's happy.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> Nice speech.<eos> Yeah, just a little bit shorter than the one dad wrote.<eos> With a slightly more generous twist.
He slept on the couch.<eos> Okay, um, maybe he didn't want to rush it.<eos> I changed into my bikini with the door open.<eos> He closed it.<eos> Okay, so what is wrong with me?<eos> Nothing is wrong with you.<eos> Something is wrong with him.<eos> Well, he called, and he asked me out again.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - For tonight.
"Wanted to"?<eos> What, they couldn't find a worse place than Battle Creek?<eos> I fought to keep him here.<eos> I called in some favors.<eos> Now do what you should have done yesterday and connect Kowalski to the crime.<eos> Russ.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I found something that seemed like it might be important.<eos> Uh, Kowalski made a credit card purchase two days ago on Air Mexico.<eos> Credit card.
- And they opened. Mine...<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Not his.<eos> Yeah, he-he told me, "That's cool."<eos> And then we watched some TV and he said he was tired.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> I just... I'm just not sending out the right vibes.<eos> But you definitely want to have sex with him, right?<eos> I definitely want to have sex.<eos> With him?
Now, we've never met, have we, sir?<eos> Ooh, patter.<eos> Do you have any children?<eos> No, but we're having fun trying.<eos> Wait. I mean three.<eos> When I snap my fingers, you shall be ten years old.<eos> Look, can we get to the point?<eos> I'm stack parked.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> Stack...
Annie is back. - Oh.<eos> Or as I like to refer to her:<eos> Annie, my ex-fiancée, the crusher of my heart, and all my hopes and all my dreams.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> - Hi!<eos> Hey, Steph!<eos> What's going on with Annie?<eos> I have to go to this big real estate dinner this weekend.<eos> She's the top seller in the state, so she's gonna be there with her husband...<eos> My ex-best friend.
Now we match.<eos> I got something for you, too.<eos> Are you going to tell me a story?<eos> I'm gonna tell you a few.<eos> I want to introduce you to some friends of mine.<eos> I carry them with me every day.<eos> Who's that?<eos> That is Susan Smith.<eos> She was a nurse.<eos> And a mother.
What you looking at?<eos> Meet Jeff and Kay Fairburn.<eos> It's Michael's so-called family.<eos> What is it?<eos> This is the guy who tried to get me to go back to my father's church.<eos> Wh... What?<eos> Wh-What is the Devil trying to do with them?<eos> I mean, how-how deep does this go?<eos> I can't believe he was here.<eos> With our girls.
And to tell you the truth, when things started getting bad with my parents a couple of years ago, I suspected something.<eos> But here's the thing:<eos> You can't just start acting like my dad.<eos> Even if you are my father, you cannot treat me the way you did this morning.<eos> I'm not a little kid anymore.<eos> You gotta respect that.<eos> I will.<eos> So...<eos> What do I call you?<eos> Lucky.
JENNY: 'Christmas is the celebration of a baby's birth.<eos> 'It is the story of a mother's love, 'her fear, her faith 'and her determination.<eos> 'It tells of promises fulfilled, 'a cradle rocked, 'a journey both concluded and begun.<eos> 'It is the story of all that is cherished, 'in a world where too little is known.'<eos> .. and of the Holy Ghost.<eos> Amen.<eos> We seek it here, we seek it there.<eos> SHE COUGHS<eos> Indeed, one is obliged to ask oneself if one is in pursuit of a comestible item,<eos> - or the Scarlet Pimpernel.
SISTER MONICA JOAN COUGHS<eos> Good afternoon, everyone...<eos> - GENERAL CHATTER - .. and, uh,<eos> - thank you...<eos> - Sh! - .. boys and girls...<eos> - .. for being nice and quiet whilst the babies were being christened.<eos> The Cradle Roll service is a very special one...<eos> - Take one and pass it down. - .. because it's one of the few days of the year when all the children in the parish get to come together to celebrate being part of our big church family.<eos> Nurse Gilbert, our Sunday school teacher, is going to bring the children's choir to the front, where they'll sing Silent Night to help us start our journey towards Christmas.<eos> - BICYCLE BELL PINGS - Merry Christmas!
How could it not be?<eos> But can I say that Daniel knew George was dead or that he killed George?<eos> Not 100%, no.<eos> Not even near that.<eos> But did I want to go to sleep in that trailer with that wigged-out son of a bitch just pacing around?<eos> Not on your life, man.<eos> I should probably get going.<eos> I've been thinking about my mom.<eos> Your real mama?<eos> One and only.
- You? Pogue job?<eos> - Uh-huh. Thought you loved the streets.<eos> Dead end.<eos> Nah. Command's where you want to be, brother.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Need anything that'sin writing, it'd be braille.<eos> - And if you do get an invi...<eos> - Hey, Barrel.<eos> - Hey! Happy New Year.<eos> - Yeah, happy New Year.
- Ah.<eos> To Crate. - To Crate.<eos> Hey, guys. Get you anything?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - Okay. - Thank you.<eos> So, he's getting out tomorrow.<eos> - He's getting out tomorrow. - Starting to talk...<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Happy New Year.<eos> Happy New Year.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey!<eos> Harry!<eos> I didn't think you'd show.<eos> How you coming with those Maclaren files?<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Happy New Year to you, too.<eos> Happy New Year.
Eleanor, give Maddie a kiss for me, - tell her I love her, will you?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Good night, Harry.<eos> Good work, detective.<eos> What was that about?<eos> Waits' gun.<eos> Yeah?<eos> There were no rounds in the weapon.<eos> Suicide by cop...<eos> By me.
I beg your madam to consider it in this way - the King has merely defined a position which ancient precedents...<eos> Ancient precedents?<eos> Precedents that you've invented these last three months.<eos> As for "induced" - Your Highness knows the King cannot be led.<eos> But he can be enticed.<eos> He has ridden off without saying goodbye.<eos> He's never done that before.<eos> Never.<eos> Well, I think he means to hunt out of Chertsey for a few days.<eos> With the woman.
Over this bill.<eos> His great protest.<eos> England is just a stage to him.<eos> Who should replace him?<eos> Put it in the King's mind to appoint Audley.<eos> He's a good man.<eos> And he understands me, I think.<eos> Do you think that someone does?<eos> Cranmer as Archbishop,<eos> Audley as Lord Chancellor.
Take her away!<eos> Mistress?<eos> I was a servant of the late Cardinal Wolsey.<eos> I understand you can converse with the souls of the dead.<eos> Wondered if you would search for him for me.<eos> I would be happy to make an offering.<eos> It would have to be a generous donation.<eos> Well, I'm a wealthy man.<eos> I'd have to talk to Father Bocking.<eos> Father Bocking?
Bit like you. Huh!<eos> So, why are you so sure that she killed herself?<eos> Think about it, Rachel, will you?<eos> She's got this motor neurone disease, right.<eos> This time next year, she'll be sat in a wheelchair with breakfast dribbling down her chin.<eos> What would you do?<eos> I know what I'd do.<eos> Guv, can I just say something?<eos> Get used to it, John.<eos> ~ What?
~ This is our job, actually. Come on.<eos> ~ Did you find anything?<eos> ~ No.<eos> ~ Do you want me to search him, guv?<eos> ~ Are you calling me a liar, Sergeant?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I think you're also lying about the Swiss maid you were having lunch with.<eos> Just a colleague!<eos> Seemed pretty close to me.<eos> Close?
What is in Easterhope for Valerie Cullen?<eos> Well, it was nowhere near her practice, so her patients didn't live there.<eos> Show me Easterhope.<eos> Actually, Rachel knows the place much better than I do.<eos> I've got a mountain of paperwork I need to do.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> ~ Mr Gently, can I just say something?<eos> ~ Get used to it.<eos> ~ What?
Tell me more about this party.<eos> ~ Oh!<eos> ~ It was at our restaurant, Pete's.<eos> Oh, the American one?<eos> Ah, right, I've heard that's good.<eos> ~ Do you own that?<eos> ~ Aye.<eos> No, we both own it.<eos> ~ Right.<eos> Near the cathedral?
Yeah?<eos> Edith.<eos> Who did this to you, Kit?<eos> Was it the lads you saw at the police station?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Their faces were covered.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I told you to stay out of town.<eos> Were you meeting your girl?<eos> What girl?
Ah well, it's better than stale fags and the dole.<eos> Who's on the dole?<eos> Do you want to go somewhere?<eos> Aye! Back to yours?<eos> You think you're so irresistible, don't you?<eos> Them little tweety-birds in there must just swoon off their perches whenever you whistle.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> Tomorrow night.<eos> OK, you win!<eos> Broad daylight.
Them little tweety-birds in there must just swoon off their perches whenever you whistle.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> Tomorrow night.<eos> OK, you win!<eos> Broad daylight.<eos> Raven Street.<eos> Be there or I'll find you.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Raven Street flats.<eos> Lunchtime.
What are you looking for?<eos> I don't really know, to tell you the truth.<eos> Hello.<eos> Inspector.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> 'Right, sir. I've just come back' from the gamekeeper now.<eos> And you were right.<eos> He recognised Lexie from the photograph, he reckons she was loitering round the grounds this last summer.<eos> 'With another lad.'
Naturally.<eos> This way.<eos> This is the reason the Archbishop sent you to our encampment.<eos> - Thomas, this is...<eos> - Sied Ibn Shams.<eos> A Saracen.<eos> A Saracen who can help you to defeat this beast.<eos> What help could a Saracen give me?<eos> He can advise you where he can.<eos> Advise?
All available security, please report to Emergency.<eos> Vinnie...<eos> You and your mom were always so much alike, Catherine.<eos> Always had big things going<eos> Worlds to save.<eos> Apples don't fall far from the tree.<eos> Eh, sometimes they do-- depends on the slope.<eos> Must have been hard for you two growing up, what with Vanessa always off doing such important work for the government.<eos> Vaccinating children in Africa, helping wounded soldiers in Afghanistan.<eos> Yeah, wounded.
Good morning, everyone.<eos> This is Bill Peterson, San Antonio D.E.A.<eos> Our victim's name is Darrell Gonzalez.<eos> He's been with the D.E.A. for seven years.<eos> Served in Afghanistan before that.<eos> I want you all to know how much I appreciate your help.<eos> We're gonna get the pigs who did this.<eos> We understand how hard it is to lose somebody.<eos> We will extend every courtesy to you.<eos> Every courtesy?
I've looked at Korbell's phone, e-mails, texts.<eos> Nothing jumps out.<eos> They're too smart to use something that easy to get into.<eos> They must have been making contact somehow.<eos> Check his day-to-day.<eos> What was Korbell looking at on the web?<eos> Based on the sites he visits, he's a Houston fan.<eos> He buys a lot of protein powder.<eos> He's into Persian longhairs.<eos> The cats?
The things you ask people to do -- it's...<eos> It's not what I thought working for the FBI would be like.<eos> At all.<eos> No.<eos> And, uh, more importantly, you wonder if your father would approve.<eos> Sometimes.<eos> He was strict.<eos> 37 years in the military makes you a stickler for the rules.<eos> I'm sure he was.<eos> And a good father.
And let your sister take the first shower.<eos> Remember, I always taught you ladies first.<eos> Okay, son.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> I love you.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Motherfucker!<eos> So this nightclub you work at, Truth, you ever interact with the owners?<eos> One particular, actually. Thomas Patrick Egan.
- So you're a good cop?<eos> - No.<eos> But I want you to know that things aren't always what they seem.<eos> I was in and out of the system, too, as a kid.<eos> I figured out early that if I got straight As, someone would always want me.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You're right. They didn't want me.<eos> They wanted that check from the state.<eos> So how did you get rich?<eos> Hard work.
Hmm, ghost and tommy have their own way of doing things.<eos> I like the independence and the product... can't complain.<eos> But bringing in the serbian?<eos> i'm not sure.<eos> Kanan wants to be in business with ghost and tommy?<eos> He knows 'em from way back.<eos> He's loyal. So am i.<eos> And we respect that.<eos> I just want you to know that from now on, You need anything, soldado nation has your back.<eos> Not kanan.
I like the independence and the product... can't complain.<eos> But bringing in the serbian?<eos> i'm not sure.<eos> Kanan wants to be in business with ghost and tommy?<eos> He knows 'em from way back.<eos> He's loyal. So am i.<eos> And we respect that.<eos> I just want you to know that from now on, You need anything, soldado nation has your back.<eos> Not kanan.<eos> You.
And i'm telling you now Because her investigation is ramping up.<eos> She started to pull away from me.<eos> No, she hasn't.<eos> I saw the way she looked at you tonight.<eos> She loves you.<eos> she fucking loves you.<eos> I saw the way you looked at her, too.<eos> You love her right back.<eos> You know, even after she gets tommy, She's gonna come for you.<eos> And me.
Relax.<eos> [sniffles] Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I ain't never processed this much money in my life, and now they want to move it?<eos> It's just been a little wild.<eos> Keep your mouth shut, though.<eos> You don't want to end up on the wrong side of this motherfucker.<eos> Look, now, we never had a problem with the Wash and Fold before.<eos> What makes you think we gotta move all the money out of here right now?<eos> - Call it a hunch.<eos> - All at once?
Doesn't work that way, Jack.<eos> You follow that logic all the way through, and we're living in anarchy.<eos> Yeah, where anyone can do anything they want, so long as they feel like it's justified.<eos> But I know where you're coming from.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Don't think it hasn't crossed my mind to just tell them all to get out of town.<eos> Which would make you an accomplice.<eos> Which, in this case, would be an honor.<eos> Don't romanticize it.<eos> Not at this table.
Okay, I admit, that part sounded bad.<eos> Let's table this discussion until we're back on the ship, all right?<eos> [TWO] The Android said that console was fried.<eos> You really think you know what you're doing?<eos> [FIVE] Well, it's like you with the controls, or...<eos> Four with his swords.<eos> For me, it's wires, circuits, fuses.<eos> I don't know why, but it just kinda makes sense to me.<eos> Not like all the other stuff.<eos> What other stuff?
A term.<eos> A label.<eos> Something that explains what I have, because it is bigger than PTSD, and right now that word is Tivon.<eos> Tivon Askari.<eos> The man who tortured you.<eos> No.<eos> No, he was more than that.<eos> He was my partner in Afghanistan.<eos> I didn't--I didn't know he was a--<eos> Double agent.
- Coffee?<eos> - Please.<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm going back to Vegas a little sooner than expected.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Maddie was in a car accident last night.<eos> - What?<eos> - She's fine.<eos> She's just a little dinged up by the airbag.<eos> - Airbag?
- Sorry for your loss.<eos> - She's gonna rot like a piece of fruit, and there's... there's nothing I can do about it.<eos> You understand?<eos> This fucking situation that I find myself in...<eos> Maybe I can help.<eos> Oh, a-are you gonna bury her for me?<eos> No, thanks. That...<eos> That's a son's duty.<eos> Why don't you put her with the others?<eos> - The others?
- She's gonna rot like a piece of fruit, and there's... there's nothing I can do about it.<eos> You understand?<eos> This fucking situation that I find myself in...<eos> Maybe I can help.<eos> Oh, a-are you gonna bury her for me?<eos> No, thanks. That...<eos> That's a son's duty.<eos> Why don't you put her with the others?<eos> - The others?<eos> - Your other victims.
Kate Chopin's words are beautiful<eos> "The voice of the sea speaks to the soul"?<eos> Yeah, well, her main character ends up killing herself in that scene. No way.<eos> Okay, well, we can't have<eos> Savage Garden lyrics read at our wedding either.<eos> What do you have against Savage Garden?<eos> You're trying to be ironic, and irony doesn't work with a traditional wedding ceremony.<eos> Okay, we have a problem, because I don't want this thing to be a snoozefest.<eos> The ceremony's gotta be...<eos> -Short and sweet.
I'm the queen of after-parties.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Nat and I can throw something together at our place.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> Oh, nothing too adulty.<eos> I'll shoot a text to everyone I know who doesn't have a mortgage.<eos> So, you guys said you wanted to talk to me about something?<eos> It's all preliminary, but I told your father what an asset you'd be.<eos> I'm sorry, an asset for...<eos> What, exactly?
Can I read that book that you were telling me about?<eos> - April: It's my only copy, so...<eos> - I will be careful with it.<eos> - Operator: 911, what's your emergency?<eos> - My husband, he's not breathing.<eos> I can't live without him.<eos> Thank you for coming by, Mr. Begley.<eos> I'll show you out.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Um... overwhelmed.
Good for him.<eos> And it sounds like everything you guys are experiencing is really normal, too.<eos> You know, especially since you went from a new relationship to marriage and living together...<eos> Yeah, for a spontaneous wedding, we really ended up being old-fashioned.<eos> Not living together till we were legal.<eos> God!<eos> How did people do this in the '50s?<eos> Why are you asking me like I was there?<eos> Brenna: Oh, my god, I cannot deal with them right now.<eos> What?
Well, a problem.<eos> How was your night?<eos> Good.<eos> The girls and I had the turkey meatloaf.<eos> There's...<eos> There's more in the fridge, if you're hungry.<eos> - How's Edwin?<eos> - Oh, he didn't show.<eos> He's probably off doing some research<eos> - with another T.A.
You can have a productive life.<eos> And if I don't, you know what that looks like, I'm not gonna die like that.<eos> George, you are the only one I can count on.<eos> Please.<eos> You need to talk to Sara.<eos> No. I'm not gonna say anything to her or the girls.<eos> They'll just try to talk me out of it.<eos> This way...<eos> I can go out with some dignity intact.<eos> Dignity?
They... they just wanted to pay in cash.<eos> Were they married?<eos> They said they were.<eos> Nothing like this has ever happened at any of my properties.<eos> I saw the bodies.<eos> How the hell were they killed?<eos> We're working on that.<eos> Were they worried at all?<eos> Did they anything that they had problems with?<eos> Not to me.
To be fair, this guy actually sounds like an asset, so I think you should let him finish the house and finish the garden and then you cut the fucking guy loose.<eos> You know what, I actually think he's nice.<eos> And he's been very generous.<eos> So then he saw the thing that you wrote and then, what?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So get this for confusing.<eos> After he'd supposedly been offended by what I wrote on the board, he calls us a few hours later on the phone and he invites us to a dinner party.<eos> - At his house.<eos> - Alone? No.<eos> With another couple.
I am... I am responsible for real cases, police cases, and I keep getting sidetracked by... Formaldehyde.<eos> What?<eos> I think I just narrowed down the list of labs for Vincent.<eos> We're trying to backtrack who infected all those innocent victims a few days ago, to try to find who's behind the experiments.<eos> Not what I was talking about, but okay.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Are you using my security clearance to gain access to classified information?<eos> Well, yeah, that's why I'm here.<eos> I couldn't do it from my place, certainly not with those thugs breathing down my neck.<eos> Thugs?
Don't be mad.<eos> If I pay her, she'll only come back.<eos> - What will you do, then?<eos> - Nothing, until I have to.<eos> Why should a paper print it, anyway?<eos> 'Earl's daughter in love tryst with married viscount'?<eos> He wasn't married then.<eos> Nor was I.<eos> It's still a good story.<eos> Anyway, what about YOUR story?
We're working on the Aaron Brown murder.<eos> I believe he stopped here minutes before he was killed.<eos> Somebody did knock on my door that night, but why would Aaron want to come see me?<eos> He didn't.<eos> He came to see your husband.<eos> What is this about?<eos> I have funeral arrangements to take care of.<eos> Mrs. Brown, we believe your husband came to Detective Martinez's house in Washington Heights the night he died.<eos> Actually, we believe he came there to see my husband, Sean Moore.<eos> Sean?
With insurance, it might be more valuable stolen.<eos> What if... the stones were never meant to be found?<eos> Diego stole the right stones, but he had no idea they were worthless.<eos> Hey, I'm talking about a horse.<eos> What are you guys talking about?<eos> There's someone else...<eos> Someone who stood to benefit from cheap diamonds being stolen.<eos> We have to look at Sean's old case files again.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What about my horse?
Stop staring at the customers.<eos> You know who that is over there?<eos> Guy in the suspenders?<eos> Some actor or something?<eos> It's Oliver Clausten.<eos> He's the C.E.O. of Clausten Capital Investments.<eos> They're as big as you can get on wall street.<eos> I must have sent my résumé over there 10 times.<eos> - Well, be the best waiter he's ever had,<eos> - Waiter?
Jo: When Jason dropped you off after the party on Clausten's boat, did you ask him where he was going?<eos> Of course.<eos> He said he just wanted to drive the car some more.<eos> Hmm. That seem odd to you?<eos> [Voice breaking] No.<eos> I'm an early bird, but Jason had this incredible energy.<eos> Like, he was just so happy to be living the life he was living.<eos> Like, he appreciated it more because of how hard he had to work for it.<eos> He was special.<eos> [Chuckles] Different. [Thud]
And why would you need to get out of town in a hurry?<eos> In case I forget what Western Europe looks like.<eos> I got to run.<eos> I've got an appointment.<eos> But, please, feel free to talk to any of my employees.<eos> Oliver said you should feel free to talk to anyone...<eos> Actually, I'm not done talking to Oliver.<eos> Long commute?<eos> Yes, well...<eos> More comfortable for two buses and a train.
We used to laugh about making it out.<eos> Jason was a good egg.<eos> Hmm. Yes, I bet he was.<eos> Which is why I was hoping you could help me with something, Melanie.<eos> Have you any idea how blood got on the carpet in Jason's office?<eos> I actually had a few more questions.<eos> Fire away.<eos> I have reason to believe that Jason was in a physical altercation of some kind in his office recently.<eos> Right.<eos> That. [Elevator bell dings]
There are a few things about your family you should know.<eos> Erik, your grandfather wasn't fleeing the Nazis.<eos> He was one of them.<eos> All the artwork in his collection was stolen, then smuggled into the U.S. after the war.<eos> No, there has to, um...<eos> There has to be some mistake.<eos> And it seems your father knew of the collection's provenance, which likely explains why he was so secretive.<eos> This can't be true.<eos> They were both...<eos> Good men.
It's possible that he was exposed to poison oak.<eos> Sam said he heard Karl arguing with somebody on the phone about a Rembrandt.<eos> The last Rembrandt sold at auction fetched almost $30 million.<eos> And because there was no record for the painting, nobody even knew it was there.<eos> Hanson, I need a warrant.<eos> Suspect's name is Julian Glausser.<eos> We've alerted our security team at all exits.<eos> Mr. Glausser will not get out of the building.<eos> - Have you seen him today?<eos> - Only this morning.
Suspect's name is Julian Glausser.<eos> We've alerted our security team at all exits.<eos> Mr. Glausser will not get out of the building.<eos> - Have you seen him today?<eos> - Only this morning.<eos> He said he was headed to the vault to prepare a shipment.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's all...<eos> Gone.<eos> Along with our suspect.
What do you mean, an heir?<eos> Now, why would I need an heir?<eos> I have you.<eos> So, uh, part of me, spiritually, will go on forever.<eos> That's very sweet of you.<eos> I think.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Sure.<eos> What do you want with my ring?<eos> Your ring?
Look, this ring belonged to the king of Urkesh.<eos> Really?<eos> Must be worth a fortune.<eos> Compared to its sentimental value, that's nothing.<eos> I'm sorry, Abe.<eos> I'm going to return it to its rightful owner.<eos> Urkesh...<eos> Is that a real country?<eos> According to Wikipedia, it is...<eos> And with a turbulent history.
My husband was everything to me!<eos> In another life, I would have been a queen, I would have lived in a palace.<eos> Does this look like a palace to you? !<eos> Do you think I care for riches? !<eos> I married my husband for love, and I loved him until the day he died...<eos> Is she having a heart attack?<eos> I'll call an ambulance.<eos> She'll be dead long before they get here.<eos> She's been poisoned...<eos> Polonium.
We're looking - for the same thing, Henry.<eos> A way out.<eos> It's the same pistol, isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> That pistol is worth more than all the gold in the world.<eos> Why?<eos> Why, Adam?<eos> Henry?<eos> Who were you talking to?<eos> No one.
When another warmongering corporate greedball Gets exposed by the faceless, it's a damn fine day.<eos> I'm sorry -- the faceless?<eos> That secret hacktivist group.<eos> "hacktivist"?<eos> [ sighs ] sometimes i forget i'm dealing with a man Who was born before they invented the steam engine.<eos> The, um, anonymous computer guys who break into systems To expose the lies and corruption of the powerful.<eos> Ah. Don't you find it ironic that the crusaders for truth Would feel compelled to hide behind a mask?<eos> Well, i never wore a mask, even when governor reagan Sicced the national guard on us in 1969.<eos> You didn't need to, with all that hair.<eos> And that mangy beard.
You can go, like, savory with cheese or sweet with chocolate, but the best part... It's social.<eos> And, therefore, a Petri dish for communicable diseases.<eos> - I'll get this tested.<eos> - Yum.<eos> So, doc, bruises on her wrists suggest she might have been held down.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> What's amazing?<eos> Her hair.<eos> It smells of...<eos> Garbage?
Zoe, take your sister.<eos> There you go.<eos> It's been a while since anybody's wanted to talk about Eddie and Lucy.<eos> Actually, we wanted to talk about you.<eos> Okay.<eos> What can I tell you?<eos> Stay-at-home dad, married twice.<eos> - I'm going out.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> With who?
She was pregnant, said she didn't want Eddie to deal with the responsibility, wanted him to pursue his music.<eos> So I took her up north, and I got her an apartment.<eos> Helped her get clean.<eos> I did that... me.<eos> After she had the baby, she wanted to go back to him.<eos> It killed me.<eos> I thought maybe...<eos> We could be a family.<eos> I told her if she went back to him, she would wind up...<eos> Dead.
We compared the blood at the scene to Eva's medical records.<eos> The foot was definitely hers.<eos> Have we notified her family?<eos> We're trying, but I.N.S. is having a tough time tracking them down.<eos> Turns out Eva's from El Cerro.<eos> It's one of the worst slums in Havana.<eos> You know, it's a pretty odd background for a ballerina.<eos> It's not odd. It's impressive.<eos> To make it out of a neighborhood like that takes determination.<eos> Well, and a whole lot of talent, too.
I was...<eos> I was drunk when I showed up.<eos> Get... off!<eos> Belinda slipped and hit her head.<eos> I tried to help her, but...<eos> And you buried her in the backyard.<eos> Tell me...<eos> What happened to the nurse that was taking care of Belinda?<eos> I waited outside the house till she left with some guy.<eos> Who?
Henry.<eos> We don't have to do this right now if you don't want to.<eos> Remains of a Jane Doe, age 65 to 75.<eos> Cause of death...<eos> Fractured sternum.<eos> Impact to the steering column, resulting in internal hemorrhaging.<eos> The cut to her lingual bone suggests that our victim's throat was cut when she was thrown through the windshield, resulting in massive blood loss.<eos> You, disagree with my assessment?<eos> I'm sorry, but, with all due respect, it appears that the victim's ribcage is broken, by something small and soft...<eos> A hand, maybe.
What are you saying?<eos> Well, the sheriff did say someone else was in the car with Abraham's mother.<eos> Maybe he tried to resuscitate her after the wreck.<eos> The break is consistent with chest compressions.<eos> He kidnapped her, forced her off the road.<eos> W-why would he save her?<eos> Because the cut to her throat was not made by the windshield.<eos> Look at the hyoid under magnification.<eos> I'm sorry, Henry, but the cut was made by...<eos> By a knife.
Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He said he needed some time off.<eos> He is at a funeral for Abe's mother.<eos> You didn't know?<eos> No.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> I'm glad he has somebody to talk to.<eos> Abigail Morgan was a mother...<eos> A wife... a nurse...
I remember arriving the morning of June 13th. And after that...<eos> I just knew what the rest of the world knew.<eos> And I just assumed Claire had died here like everybody else.<eos> And if she didn't die here, then where did she die?<eos> And how did she die? And why didn't you know?<eos> Are they doing something else with the evos?<eos> Well, if you can't tell me, who's going to tell me?<eos> What?<eos> What? Why are you so interested in her?<eos> In me?
Carlos, I have a favor to ask.<eos> I have to put two evos, good people, on a boat to Vancouver.<eos> Their journey starts from your brother's secret room.<eos> Tonight. Why do you care so much about them?<eos> My only calling is to minister to the poor, troubled, and persecuted, and... one more thing.<eos> I don't have a right to be weirded out by you and Brad being bros, but I am.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> He punched me the other day, and now he's my best friend.<eos> The whole thing's so crazy. I mean, Brad thinks you made his stepdad disappear, but you swear you didn't.<eos> Yeah, on my mother's eyes.
What can I do for you?<eos> Alexander French?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> My god, that was a pretty shot.<eos> Did you see how his body crumpled before his eyes even realized he was dead?<eos> Luke, I asked you a question.<eos> Yeah, honey, that was a really pretty shot.<eos> But this man, he had a family.<eos> This man was a monster.<eos> With a wife and a kid.
It's gorgeous out. I've been fighting this wicked headache the last couple days, so...<eos> No, no, it just... it just... it feels better in the dark.<eos> Take a bloody aspirin.<eos> No, I'll be fine.<eos> Look, babe, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and...<eos> I think maybe I should sit out this next appointment.<eos> Maybe you should too.<eos> Maybe we both should.<eos> We could... I don't know, we could rent a boat and watch the sunset, and maybe open a bottle of wine, be normal like we used to be.<eos> Normal?
Hi!<eos> I have such a big surprise for you!<eos> Something's happening.<eos> Remember how yesterday on the stairs we were talking about how we both always wanted cats when we were growing up?<eos> Well... ta-da!<eos> Outside the grocery store was this pet adoption thing, which was kismet, so I got us a cat and named it...<eos> Kismet!<eos> Kismet, meet Zara.<eos> Now, the guy said to let him out very slowly and let him sniff out his environment.<eos> Yeah. Oh! Oh!
- I can't do that, Wes.<eos> Do you understand what that means?<eos> Burning! It means we end this.<eos> Ow! Please, make him stop!<eos> Drill, stop it!<eos> Mr. President, I know you're seeing this!<eos> This is not who we are. We can't do it this way.<eos> Sir, we may not get another shot.<eos> This is our chance to destroy the enemy.<eos> - Yes, at what cost?

We can't do it this way.<eos> Sir, we may not get another shot.<eos> This is our chance to destroy the enemy.<eos> - Yes, at what cost?<eos> - "At what cost?"
You've never been involved in an operation before?<eos> No.<eos> Great.<eos> The meet is in two hours.<eos> Debriefings work on details.<eos> That's how you trip up someone trying to lie to you.<eos> Her file is on the computer next door.<eos> I read it already.<eos> It's 400 pages.<eos> 406... And 1/4.
I need to be back in two hours, or my people will start to wonder where I went.<eos> Okay, the more specific you are the easier it will be for us to confirm your story.<eos> Please have a seat.<eos> Why don't we start with Wednesday night?<eos> We were driven from Manhattan in windowless vans.<eos> Two-hour drive, but we could have been driving in circles and we wouldn't know.<eos> When they opened the van doors, we were already inside a garage, so I couldn't see any of the landscape around the plant.<eos> We go into hiding, abroad.<eos> We leave tonight.<eos> Tonight?
Well, if that is her ladyship's fixed resolution, perhaps she should give her assistance towards obtaining a divorce.<eos> I believe a divorce is what Lady Worsley wishes for.<eos> There will be no divorce.<eos> Was Jane with him?<eos> - Did you see my Mary?<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> Perhaps they remain elusive.<eos> Seymour, he was with a lawyer.<eos> What?<eos> A lawyer?
The porcelain is from Thomas Jefferson's Monticello estate.<eos> The flowers etched into this crystal are a favorite of a First Lady.<eos> They belonged to Abigail Adams.<eos> To you, Katrina... the soon-to-be mother.<eos> I'm so thrilled for you to experience the joys of motherhood, as I have.<eos> Ichabod is going to be the happiest man alive.<eos> That is, until he meets the little monster.<eos> Seeing her things here... makes me realize I left that world so abruptly.<eos> I never got the chance to say good-bye to her.<eos> To anyone.
Of course.<eos> This death is identical to a series of murders from 1781.<eos> The manner in which way his throat is sliced and the body inverted...<eos> The Durham killings.<eos> John Adams was the lawyer seeking justice for the victims.<eos> He was.<eos> But it was not John I learned the specifics of the case from.<eos> It was Abigail Adams.<eos> Your friend, Mrs. Adams, was a...<eos> - A witch?
The Durham killings.<eos> John Adams was the lawyer seeking justice for the victims.<eos> He was.<eos> But it was not John I learned the specifics of the case from.<eos> It was Abigail Adams.<eos> Your friend, Mrs. Adams, was a...<eos> - A witch?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No.<eos> Just highly opinionated.
Then they realized that was just a diversion to keep them from looking for the real murder weapon.<eos> If you kill me now, the FBI is going to assign a dozen counterintelligence agents to investigate Alex to see if there's a connection.<eos> You lose him as a source forever.<eos> And you're gonna give the FBI an awful lot of strings to pull which you are at the end of.<eos> The laptop will go to Moscow.<eos> They'll get through the encryption eventually.<eos> And then we will know if you're telling the truth.<eos> Until then, we will be watching you.<eos> Every minute of the day and night.<eos> You and your whole family.
Charmain.<eos> [dial tone echoing] [Garrick] Leadership, bravery, and common sense.<eos> When a man takes that oath and puts on that shield, these are the qualities that one must hope he has.<eos> But some among us have more than their fair share of such qualities.<eos> They lead by valorous example.<eos> Everything that lives dies.<eos> But even the briefest spark shines.<eos> Our first child will light our hearts into the future, a future that belongs to him.<eos> [Manson] His is the purest living soul among us, the sacred black canvas of innocence, who we christen this night<eos> Valentine Michael Manson.
I'm trying to quit that, too, but...<eos> Body wants what it wants.<eos> Right, detective?<eos> Right now, this body only wants an alibi.<eos> I was upstate visiting my sister until this morning.<eos> - You can check with her.<eos> - We will.<eos> Anything else you can tell me about Peter?<eos> He was a chef.<eos> Good one.
We're gonna put an end to this, right?<eos> - Wrong.<eos> - Wrong?<eos> - Wrong.<eos> - Wrong?<eos> Soto, we are men of our word.<eos> You like this.<eos> Let's just say, a week of taking care of Laura... isn't that bad.<eos> So do you meet all your dates on high speed chases through Greenwich Village?<eos> Every one.
A year ago, I had a realization.<eos> The illegal pot business is simply not sustainable.<eos> The future is organic.<eos> Hop shoots.<eos> Hipsters pay 600 bucks a pound for this stuff.<eos> - Now that's criminal.<eos> - That's Brooklyn.<eos> All right.<eos> Where were you three nights ago?<eos> - Here with Millie.
He did.<eos> Now, Hendricks votes one, Bachman votes one, and we, at Raviga, we vote three.<eos> That is a majority.<eos> We can now take the necessary steps to ensure that Pied Piper is properly managed.<eos> What're you saying?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Monica, I believe you do.<eos> Always blue!<eos> Always blue!<eos> Always blue! Always blue!
Wait, are you... are you accusing me of this?<eos> Hell, I loved that guy.<eos> The old man only had one or two more years before his retirement;<eos> his job would have been mine soon enough.<eos> I didn't want it this way.<eos> I'm Milt Chamberlain of the FBI.<eos> We don't mean to accuse you of anything.<eos> We're just wondering if Coach Zuransky had any conflicts that you were aware of.<eos> Only one.<eos> With T.D. E.D.
No, I was a bowler.<eos> There was no football in Tehran or Monaco, so I played cricket.<eos> And athletes don't just get things handed to them, they work hard.<eos> They practice 20 hours a week.<eos> You know... you might not have ever played the game, but you're still living that QB lifestyle, Milt.<eos> Yeah, instead of a jersey, you-you wear a badge and you got your car and your stupid haircut and you get the mayor to call you and assign you the leads on cases that you don't know anything about, because nothing ever changes.<eos> And who were you in high school, Russ?<eos> Huh? Judd Nelson, class tough guy?<eos> Skate punk?<eos> Auto shop?
You are? Oh, my daughter.<eos> Taylor.<eos> I need to find Francis.<eos> I wonder if he knows where Francis is.<eos> Francis?<eos> Francis Culp. Why are you interested in Francis Culp?<eos> You read my mind.<eos> Yeah, that's sort off my thing.<eos> I need to talk to Micah Sanders.<eos> Micah?
I just wanted you to have a normal life.<eos> That's what a mom does-- protects her child.<eos> Mom, I can handle it.<eos> I know, and that's why you are ready for me to tell you about who you are.<eos> Okay.<eos> The comic book you love--<eos> "9th Wonders"?<eos> You have more in common with your favorite character than you think.<eos> Hiro Nakamura?<eos> Yep, him.
Driving, huh?<eos> Can you drop me off on the road?<eos> Where are they?<eos> -In The garage.<eos> Are you home alone?<eos> Yes, they can not fucking stay here.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> He knows everything.<eos> Stop the gun away as we speak with them, we will find a solution.<eos> -As Ahmed?
Daddy, everything's changing.<eos> _<eos> Despite our influences, we've not been able to learn the location of the laboratory that cultivates the virus:<eos> the Night Room.<eos> We're pursuing a scientist who knows.<eos> _<eos> Henri Toussaint is dead.<eos> The epidemic caused by the River fever we planted drew him out, but he was murdered before he could be questioned.<eos> By who?<eos> James Cole.
How was your bath?<eos> I've wanted to meet you for some time.<eos> I knew your father.<eos> My company contributed to his research many years ago.<eos> May I?<eos> Did he ever tell you how much he loved you?<eos> My father was the same.<eos> He had plans for me.<eos> Like... there was a thing in a box, with printed instructions.<eos> Difficult... problematic.
Look.<eos> Where'd you get these?<eos> This can't be real.<eos> This is my work.<eos> In the future, this will all be very, very real.<eos> - Where's Cassie?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> She sewed up your wound, and she left.<eos> Said she had to get help.<eos> - What kind of help?
I'll need a microscope.<eos> Uh, there's one upstairs in the office.<eos> I'll draw a fresh blood sample.<eos> Come on.<eos> You need to lie down.<eos> Come here.<eos> - How'd you convince her?<eos> - The way you taught me.<eos> With a gun and the truth.<eos> Gun?
Markridge got a new CEO in late 2015.<eos> _<eos> Facing facts, coming to terms...<eos> we don't need graphs and pie charts to illustrate what a shit show this year has been.<eos> The death of Leland Goines, the Operation Troy debacle, the vanishing of Dr. Peters...<eos> these things subjected us to substantial economic gravity.<eos> And we are, quite frankly, hemorrhaging trust.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> A takeover.<eos> Hostile.
That woman, one of Markridge's key investors...<eos> Yeah.<eos> ...chances are she knows the new CEO.<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> Who are all these people?<eos> Doctors, shareholders.<eos> They're all here for the keynote address.<eos> They all want to know where the new CEO is gonna lead Markridge.<eos> Leland Goines, my father, was just a man.<eos> But what kind of man?
One more thing.<eos> The dodo...<eos> silly thing.<eos> Couldn't fly, too fat, flapped its wings futilely... into extinction.<eos> My father created Markridge as a place to defy the order of things, to ignore the rules, to laugh at Mother Nature and spit in the face of Father Time.<eos> Beginning today, Markridge will start repairing the damage that men like my father have done to this world.<eos> Through genetic manipulation... we will give new birth to what man has so arrogantly made extinct.<eos> The lease is up.<eos> Time to give the world back to its rightful owners...<eos> the animals!
~ Keep it.<eos> Please. Keep it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry for the concern that I gave you, Bell.<eos> I'm sorry for the things I said.<eos> I'm sorry for any sadness my occupation has caused.<eos> Well, as you said, it was I who suggested that you get it in the first place.<eos> You were not specific.<eos> I had in mind, in fact, that you might become a justice of the peace.<eos> Or a landscape gardener.
-Yeah.<eos> -My first dance.<eos> -Yeah!<eos> What's your plan?<eos> I made it so when the music starts, you'll "accidentally" bump into Hadrian.<eos> Today is gonna be so exciting!<eos> It already is.<eos> -Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> -What?<eos> Hadrian?
-My first dance.<eos> -Yeah!<eos> What's your plan?<eos> I made it so when the music starts, you'll "accidentally" bump into Hadrian.<eos> Today is gonna be so exciting!<eos> It already is.<eos> -Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> -What?<eos> Hadrian?<eos> Yeah, Hadrian. The guy with the great, red, wavy hair.
A real smile.<eos> This is one of my better ones.<eos> You used to love the Spring Ball.<eos> Dad, I'm just too old for this.<eos> I just want to see the happy Marianne I used to know.<eos> Before the Roland misunderstanding.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> Well, I hope you're happy enough to dance with your father.<eos> Or someone even better.
Well, at least you're not singing.<eos> I'm coming straight on for you<eos> I've made up my mind<eos> Taking a little break?<eos> I'm feeling strong now<eos> Well...<eos> Now I'm coming through -Need any help, sire?<eos> -No.<eos> I'm coming straight on for you<eos> Yeah! Straight on for you
Seriously?<eos> He was so in love.<eos> But Bog, he had no patience.<eos> That's enough!<eos> So, he came to me for my love potion.<eos> I tried to tell him how it worked.<eos> But he dusted the sweet, unsuspecting creature.<eos> Plum, I beg you.<eos> As she was gazing into the eyes of a lovesick Bog...<eos> Even with a love potion,
Maybe I should take it from here.<eos> Wild thing<eos> You make my heart sing<eos> You make everything<eos> Groovy<eos> Oh, wild thing<eos> -You make my heart sing<eos> -You make my heart sing<eos> You make everything<eos> Groovy
You know, we're all good with grips, but I could use someone in craft service.<eos> Put him there.<eos> Taylor...<eos> Assistant director:<eos> First team rehearsal everybody.<eos> (Bell rings)<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Um, I'll talk to him.<eos> _<eos> Okay.
Troop numbers. Ship numbers.<eos> Anything that you hear from an officer ranked captain or higher.<eos> You invite this danger into our family?<eos> No, Robert, you did when you chose to tell me his secret.<eos> As a warning.<eos> As an example to keep your mouth as a bridle.<eos> The wrong word, written or said, can get a man hanged.<eos> Is that what you wish for me?<eos> I wish for you to choose a side and act.<eos> With faith and conviction.

Well, dial them back, or say something next time you walk into a room.<eos> [THE ANDROID] Are you afraid of them now?<eos> You think I should be?<eos> They show a history of violence, mental instability, extreme anti-social behavior, deceit--<eos> What's important is who they are now.<eos> An admirable attitude.<eos> Also, potentially a very foolish and dangerous one.<eos> Hey, you're the one who tried to kill us.<eos> The result of a programmed directive which has since been deleted.<eos> Same with them maybe, right?
[whispers] Look, you... you can't win this. If you stay here and fight, you'll die.<eos> I'm hoping it's not gonna come to that.<eos> We have help coming, and more weapons.<eos> [THREE] That's the spirit.<eos> Don't let the bastards get you down.<eos> As for us, we gotta get back to our spaceship.<eos> --Not yet. --[THREE] Oh.<eos> At least allow us to thank you.<eos> Ah, that bloodthirsty look in your eyes, all the thanks I need.<eos> With song and drink.
Contingency plans have been enacted.<eos> Again, that won't be necessary, Deliverance.<eos> This is our show.<eos> [NIEMAN] Not anymore it's not.<eos> Raza, I'm on my way over.<eos> [MAN B] That's far enough!<eos> [MAN C] Is that any way to act, after Ferrous Corp. made you such a generous offer?<eos> ! You'd turn us into slaves on our own land!<eos> One last chance to reconsider!<eos> [ONE] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!
No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Give me the short version.<eos> All right, says here, in 1991,<eos> Rabbi Lev and a bunch of his radical followers were caught trying to blow up the Temple Mount.<eos> Shin Bet uncovered the plot.<eos> They arrested the six co-conspirators unloading explosives. But Rabbi Lev?<eos> Taken in and questioned, never charged.<eos> Well, those guys always keep their hands clean.<eos> You talked to someone about the breastplate... who was it?<eos> - My uncle, Shimon.
I can't imagine you small and harmless.<eos> Well, I was definitely small.<eos> And, luckily for you, I paid attention.<eos> I can lend you my notes, if you'd like, Hugh.<eos> I-I think I can manage.<eos> Thanks, Dottie.<eos> Now, this guillotine is a rather rudimentary model, but the principle remains the same.<eos> So, I assume the trick is to keep the lethal section of the blade out of the way.<eos> Exactly.<eos> With this.
MacKenzie hasn't performed The Mermaid for ten years - not since what's-her-name left.<eos> Tilly, I think it was.<eos> Before my time.<eos> Are you a magician too, Sid?<eos> No, I'm just the general dog's body.<eos> Didn't they tell you that?<eos> Well, you must have picked up a few tips in your time with MacKenzie?<eos> I'd be an idiot if I hadn't.<eos> As entertaining as this is, Miss Fisher, I have an investigation to get on with.<eos> Careful with that.
I don't want a drink, I want an explanation, Baron of Rich.<eos> So, murdered, you say.<eos> This is dreadful for me.<eos> For you?<eos> Saturday night is sold out.<eos> The crowds have been waiting ten years for the return of the Miraculous Mermaid.<eos> It's meant to be utterly thrilling.<eos> MacKenzie was going to recapture the magic with the amazing Ruby.<eos> ~ Pearl.<eos> ~ Yes, her.
If memory serves me, that's somewhere on Sydney Road?<eos> Sydney Road, Brunswick.<eos> We know James Manning was nosing around them, trying to find out who sabotaged his plane.<eos> Perhaps that's where he met this mystery woman.<eos> Does that match our ticket?<eos> Yes, Miss.<eos> This ticket will get you there.<eos> Sounds like you ladies need an escort to the wrong side of town.<eos> ~ Any excuse to see you-know-who.<eos> ~ Who?
Admit it, Jack, being a woman definitely has its assets.<eos> Well, I... appreciate your assets.<eos> Now, if we could hurry up this break-in.<eos> I'm not breaking anything. I'm merely taking a circuitous route.<eos> Keys.<eos> Numbers would have made this a lot easier.<eos> Suggest that to your captain friend.<eos> Eureka.<eos> ~ Third time lucky.<eos> ~ Fourth.
You'll be locked up because you're a murderous thug.<eos> How's Squadron Leader Jones doing?<eos> Have you finished with him?<eos> Not yet, Captain.<eos> We just need a statement about Rupert Higgins and the relationship he was having with a woman who was posing as James Manning.<eos> I assume you'll charge Higgins with murder.<eos> The Air Force will most certainly be pressing charges of sabotage.<eos> A woman?<eos> James was a woman?<eos> Virginia Forbes.
Let me deal with Her Highness while you start on the autopsy,<eos> ~ that way I can legitimately tell her that you're busy.<eos> ~ Thank you. A lot of money for a street urchin.<eos> At least he spent it wisely.<eos> ~ I'll take it up with Paddy.<eos> (Sighs) Someone meant business.<eos> Looks like it's happened before.<eos> Dot, I need to find out what species this is.<eos> If you could consult our resident ornithologist?<eos> Mr Butler?
Yes, I loved Luisa.<eos> But her parents did not approve of my family.<eos> Well, she wanted to run away, to leave all the families.<eos> But how could I leave everything I knew?<eos> Is that when she stole the book?<eos> Well, she stole the book, thinking that I would follow her.<eos> But there's more to life than love.<eos> Where were you on Thursday afternoon?<eos> Where I am always - here.<eos> With a good friend of mine.
With a good friend of mine.<eos> ~ Your friend's name?<eos> ~ Roberto Salvatore.<eos> How convenient that you can confirm each other's whereabouts.<eos> ~ Concetta?<eos> ~ Si.<eos> Thursday afternoon - where I was?<eos> Here at the restaurant.<eos> And with who I was?<eos> Roberto Salvatore.
I told you, she knew nothing.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> Marianna... .. she find this underneath the floorboards where that old woman had hidden it.<eos> She brought it up on herself when she was going to make that dish - a Strano dish.<eos> My nonno, he always knew she stole the book.<eos> When she announced she'd serve it on the first night of the festival, it was a slap in the face to my family's honour, a disgrazia.<eos> ~ So you poisoned her?<eos> How?<eos> ~ With the mushrooms.<eos> ~ The death caps.
Someone should let those poor birds go free.<eos> No, they wouldn't survive out in the world, Jemima.<eos> Just like us.<eos> I'm sorry, I think I need to go and be free now.<eos> And Dr Samuels has encouraged me to do it in my room.<eos> How serious were these arguments with Betsy?<eos> I'm not sure, miss, but she seems very upset.<eos> My condolences, Jemima.<eos> You were friends with Betsy, weren't you?<eos> Best friends.
It's an old habit.<eos> We all have them.<eos> And it's so hard to stop, isn't it?<eos> Jemima?<eos> You alright?<eos> We were only talking.<eos> I know, but... you've all had a big shock.<eos> And Dr Samuels would like everyone to go to their rooms and get changed for group reflection.<eos> Aunt P, do you have any idea who might have wanted to harm Betsy Cohen?<eos> Here, under my roof?
Unladylike?<eos> Aunt P, your staircase is lethal.<eos> Your mind always jumps to murder.<eos> Have you noticed?<eos> It's a very bad habit.<eos> How long has Dr Samuels been treating you?<eos> A few weeks.<eos> I'm sure I told you, he's helping me with my insomnia.<eos> I'm sure you haven't told me.<eos> What insomnia?
Is there anything else you'd like to know?<eos> I see...<eos> Victoria Broadford bequeathed her entire estate.<eos> She was very grateful to Dr Samuels.<eos> 'Prudence Stanley - £1,000.'<eos> Yes.<eos> Why don't you ask your aunt if she was talked into it?<eos> I wish I'd never opened my doors.<eos> What about this hypnosis treatment you've been having?<eos> What hypnosis? !
She was poisoned to keep her quiet.<eos> Our options seem to be narrowing.<eos> The key to it all could be in Jemima Littleton's head.<eos> Sounds like an impenetrable place.<eos> She has trouble recalling trauma, that's all, like most of us, including my Aunt Prudence.<eos> I wonder if hypnosis would help?<eos> Allowing a prime suspect to help us with a witness is a first... ~ .. even for you.<eos> Now, Jemima... .. I want you to think back to what Betsy told you about Harriet.<eos> She said she was shocked by Harriet.<eos> By what exactly?
Any day now, I'd say.<eos> Well, I thought, in the meanwhile, maybe you could teach me a few things.<eos> Teach you?<eos> I still have a lot to learn.<eos> Not as much as me, I think.<eos> Why run to the rooftop where there's no means of escape?<eos> He had a knife-wielding robber right behind him.<eos> Not everyone's cool under fire.<eos> And then the robber pushed McNabb over the side.<eos> Along with your bag.
Can I do that in my room, with the door closed?<eos> No - I insist that you come to my cocktail party and show the world you're above the fray.<eos> It'll make you feel better, promise.<eos> Dot?<eos> (Shudders) Dot!<eos> DOT!<eos> Ingenious, Miss Fisher.<eos> So, the intended victim secured the area by trapping a spider under a... a what?<eos> Just call it an internal device.<eos> An internal...
So, who else could have paid Belinda for that 12th shot?<eos> Maybe the clue lies in No.11.<eos> Game.<eos> Miss Lombard leads by one set.<eos> Refreshments will now be served on the south terrace.<eos> Jack, is that Constance in the background?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> ~ What's she doing?<eos> Having some kind of trouble with her tennis dress?<eos> Not her dress.
Not billions of years.<eos> Close your gab!<eos> Gentlemen, thank you.<eos> When was the last time you scientists read your Bible?<eos> It's not for mankind to solve God's mysteries and he will punish you come Judgement Day!<eos> Mr Tode, I would like to know how, as an Englishman, you obtained your data from the Southern Hemisphere?<eos> Mr Efendi, thank you but I'm afraid we're out of time.<eos> Mr Tode?<eos> - Well, when did he escape?<eos> - Last night.
It was hidden in the grevillea.<eos> Make you sure the whole area's searched thoroughly, Collins.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - What about... (.. the gatekeeper, Hugh? )<eos> He said he saw a dark figure, sir, dressed in black.<eos> A police officer?<eos> Possibly, but with no feet, and a glowing ring around its neck.<eos> The gatekeeper's convinced it was an alien.<eos> Or someone more ecclesiastical.<eos> Psalms 19.
Not 100% sure, Albert, but I think a great deal of money would at least keep him at bay.<eos> Seasickness pills, headache, cough tincture, eye drops.<eos> Quentin Tode was clearly a man obsessed by his health.<eos> And scientific research.<eos> He's got more books and papers with him than clothing.<eos> I'll have this sent over to Dr Macmillan and tested for poison.<eos> Jack, look.<eos> This essay, it's by Osman Efendi, not Quentin Tode.<eos> Tode's made notes on all his data.<eos> Slight alterations.
My father has managed to escape his house arrest.<eos> His letter was with the rest of the mail this afternoon.<eos> It could've been stolen and altered at any stage.<eos> Who knows how long this man's been lurking.<eos> Poor Baron.<eos> He thought he was putting us all in danger.<eos> This was not a noble gesture, Dot.<eos> It's not in my father's repertoire.<eos> No. He's up to something.<eos> - With our cab.
Well, if it's all expanding, England will move further away.<eos> But it all looks very still to me.<eos> That's because you're not a telescope.<eos> - Is that supposed to be a compliment?<eos> - More like a romantic overture.<eos> - Is that the best that you can do?<eos> - Would you like me to improve on it?<eos> More than anything.<eos> Jack.<eos> Behind you.
I'm a shit guy?<eos> You're crazy.<eos> You're, like, a cat lady, except not old.<eos> Sometimes when you kiss me, I feel the oil from your nose coat my face.<eos> You have no money.<eos> I have self-esteem issues, so I don't know if I'm with you 'cause you're good or just 'cause you're available.<eos> You're bad at sex.<eos> I can go forever with you, literally forever.<eos> I usually need to think of something bad to stop myself from ejaculating.<eos> Never with you.
Every time we have pasta, You say "that's a lot of cheese."<eos> I know it's a lot of cheese. That is how much cheese I like.<eos> So, please, Take a mental note that I like a lot of cheese So we don't have to talk about it again.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have as much cheese as you like.<eos> Yes.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Is it that time of the month? No!<eos> I had sex with a man.<eos> A different man.
For another few hours just so that you can have dessert.<eos> -Fine.<eos> -I'll go get you some cash for mine.<eos> -No, no.<eos> No, no. Tom, take this.<eos> My shout.<eos> Special treat.<eos> -Thank you. -Mm-hmm.<eos> -Oh, josh, could I please talk to you for a moment?<eos> Claire, too, actually.
S-- oh, I should have knocked.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> -Yeah, everything would be great if you'd knocked.<eos> -Oh...<eos> Well, uh, are you okay?<eos> -Think we're beyond that question now.<eos> -Do you still want to do christmas?<eos> -Might as well.<eos> -We'll talk about this later. -Yeah.<eos> Between mains and dessert?
Ilana!<eos> Oh... saved by the bell.<eos> The boys with the penises!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Oh, it's coming.<eos> (Lincoln) We were looking everywhere for you.<eos> Except, we forgot to look for you.<eos> Hey, do either of you two have like, a knife?<eos> Because me and Lincoln want to become blood brothers.<eos> Blood brothers.
- There he is!<eos> Little Sprout. ( kissing )<eos> - Good morning, Abraham.<eos> - Good morning, all.<eos> Eat your breakfast. There we go.<eos> I didn't hear you come in last night.<eos> Oh, I was bone-tired.<eos> I didn't want to wake you.<eos> So, tell us, how was the trip?<eos> Well,itwassuccessful.
Time is so precious.<eos> I always wanted to see the northern lights, and I'm on my way there right now with the love of my life.<eos> Unless you have something more magical than that. I didn't think so.<eos> He made me a spreadsheet.<eos> Shahir doing a birth plan.<eos> I'm picturing a flow chart and statistical analysis.<eos> Well, he is thorough.<eos> Here, have a look at this bruise.<eos> Wow. He was definitely hit with something.<eos> Yeah, with a pipe or a baseball bat.
Let's go.<eos> How many tickets do we have left?<eos> Enough for a ride or some games.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Remember when I made Nat take me on this?<eos> Right before you threw up your cotton candy all over her?<eos> That time?<eos> Good times.<eos> Should we all go on?<eos> With her?
Previously on "Secrets And Lies"...<eos> - How did the flashlight ditch go?<eos> - I put it back behind those thick trees.<eos> Out by the mall?
And if you can't testify, we need to take a plea.<eos> You got to figure this out.<eos> You got to remember.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Just trying to get through today.<eos> Thank you so much for going to the trouble.<eos> Please, stop. It's no trouble at all.<eos> Now, my grandmother used to say that it needed to sit for at least two hours before she served it, but for me, it's at least a half an hour to...<eos> Um, I have to go.<eos> Merry Christmas.

Um, there is one thing, and it's one of the reasons why I thought that Scott killed Tom.<eos> Jess.<eos> I don't want to be late.<eos> You know what?<eos> It's probably nothing.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> - Hey, wait up!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> Merry Christmas.
How the hell can you tell it's a boy?<eos> You can't.<eos> It's too early.<eos> Christy's blood-test results were mailed to the house.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> No, I think it does, buddy, because you're showing it around to the whole bar here?<eos> You're carrying it in your wallet for six years?<eos> That's pretty creepy.<eos> Hey, man, that cop Cornell, when she came in here, who'd she talk to?<eos> Everyone.
Oh, You know what? I forgot something in the ballroom.<eos> What? Can't it wait till later?<eos> I wish.<eos> Stay right here.<eos> I'll be right back, okay?<eos> Mom.<eos> What the hell is she doing here?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Who were you with?<eos> A nice young man.
I'm proud of you.<eos> Not just for what you did here, but what you're going to do in the future.<eos> I expect great things.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant.<eos> I need to heal up first, though.<eos> And when you do, remember, scars only show us where we've been, they do not dictate where we are going.<eos> Mr. Rossi.<eos> Thomas.<eos> When did you get in?<eos> Last night.
Dad?<eos> And they have no idea what the motive behind this killing--<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> It's just...<eos> The news.<eos> Whole world is going to hell.<eos> It's not healthy for you to sit back here all the time in the dark.<eos> Did you get your medicine?<eos> This morning.
I don't like caffeine, no caffeine...<eos> How about some vitamins?<eos> Of course, always.<eos> - Here's to...<eos> - ...chugging it.<eos> ...to working together.<eos> We'll wait in the car.<eos> Mr. Horst.<eos> Off you go.<eos> The kids.
We'll wait in the car.<eos> Mr. Horst.<eos> Off you go.<eos> The kids.<eos> - What's your school called?<eos> - Hogwarts.<eos> Hogwart?<eos> Never heard of it.<eos> Is that with G or CK?<eos> With G, you brain.
You saw how they treated us.<eos> I'm doing this for us.<eos> - You're doing it for you!<eos> - No, for us.<eos> - Leave us out of it.<eos> - Shall we talk about it?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be back in three hours. Then we can all go away.<eos> As a family.
- They're only accurate.<eos> And we want to tell you what we see for your future because I think that's a little bit more accurate, to be honest with you.<eos> You're not a number.<eos> You're a person.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> You can't see the future.<eos> In a way, we can, Max.<eos> We can because we've watched you... we've watched you grow... grow.<eos> Yup, and we're very proud of what we see.<eos> And in so many amazing, amazing ways.
I love you.<eos> I don't like this.<eos> I know, but sometimes you got to suck it up.<eos> Look at you working away.<eos> What?<eos> Like, you're just giving them such nice attention.<eos> Yeah, well, you got to.<eos> Um, that's what the problem is.<eos> People don't, and it's like throwing money out the window.<eos> Especially these...
He was not so great about getting them developed.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> - Aw. - Yeah.<eos> Oh, you guys look so beautiful.<eos> Yeah, you know, I remember this.<eos> This was just after I told your dad that I was pregnant with Julia.<eos> Oh. He looks a little...<eos> Well, shocked?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Terrified, really.
He likes you.<eos> And I like him.<eos> I think he's...<eos> I think he's the guy, Sarah.<eos> You know, I don't think I would have ever found him... um... if you hadn't let me come home, stay here for awhile.<eos> It just changed everything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have I been a good father?<eos> The very best.
I have a family emergency.<eos> I got it. - Okay.<eos> - "Laura."<eos> - Period.<eos> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> "It's your stranger from the train.<eos> - Film reference. - Nice.<eos> "Would you do me the honor of joining me for dinner this Friday's eve?"<eos> That's pretty good, yeah.<eos> - "This Friday's Eve"?
Was it that creepy kid with the dead eye, Tobias?<eos> Tobias.<eos> Then who was it?<eos> The point is I just, I can't take this anymore.<eos> I'm sorry, Josh. I'm leaving.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Oh, my... Oh...<eos> Wait, okay. d-don't go.<eos> Please, we can... we can try new things, we can spice it up.<eos> Different-Different Web sites. I...
Oh, this is fun.<eos> I'm gonna get back to my friends.<eos> - No, please, just wait. - Bye.<eos> It was hands down the best opera I've ever seen in my whole life.<eos> - Yeah, I heard it's crazy hard to get tickets.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, the director's actually a friend of mine, so<eos> - he kind of hooked us up.<eos> - Oh, honey, wait.<eos> - Hmm? What?
Who are you guys?<eos> We are sex aliens from the planet Sex.<eos> We have come to have sex with you.<eos> Prepare yourself for sex.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop.<eos> Just-just stop.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Well, I kind of just started seeing someone.<eos> Who?

Prepare yourself for sex.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop.<eos> Just-just stop.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Well, I kind of just started seeing someone.<eos> Who?<eos> Her?<eos> JOSH:<eos> Y-Yes, her.
- No.<eos> No, that's not...<eos> - No? That's never, ever going to happen.<eos> You're my employee.<eos> Bitch.<eos> Aw, Liz, have you been on any dates?<eos> Mom, no, not really. I'm just...<eos> I'm just focusing on work for a while.<eos> Why don't you let me set you up with Chip? Chip?<eos> Mom, no.
She's heard about the potato salad. I would be so honored if I could get the recipe.<eos> We're having people over for dinner on Saturday night, and I'm still missing a starch.<eos> Lady is looking for a starch. You're hosting a dinner party?<eos> - Together? - Oh, y-yes.<eos> Yes, we are, yes, we are.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, that would be a potluck?<eos> - No, I'm making everything.<eos> - You're making everything?<eos> - Buffet or sit-down?
He loved us for it.<eos> Died for it.<eos> None of this matters now.<eos> You heard the zealot.<eos> We need to leave before they find us.<eos> Before it's our turn to look down from Golgotha.<eos> You need to rest.<eos> It's been a stressful period.<eos> You've done exceptionally well to steer the community to calmer waters.<eos> With your support, as ever.
We don't have long before he does.<eos> We need to find that body.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Well, work harder.<eos> Sir.<eos> What is this?<eos> A member of the guard from the Nazarene's tomb to speak to you.<eos> Why does he tremble?<eos> - With fear.<eos> - Of what?
This way.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Safe, for now.<eos> Why are you helping us?<eos> History will determine whether your path or mine will drive the Romans from Judea.<eos> In the meantime, an enemy of theirs is a friend of ours.<eos> I told my friends to make their way to the city gate so we can find a way out to Galilee.<eos> There are fewer soldiers there.<eos> We can help.<eos> Not by killing.
And if we want to enlist his help, we have to get there before the heroes do.<eos> How do you feel about kale salad?<eos> Like someone found someplace other than granny's for takeout.<eos> I'm fine with her grilled cheese, but I know it gets to you.<eos> [ chuckles ] You eat like a child.<eos> Is that a root beer?<eos> Two. I got you one.<eos> Thought you could use a break.<eos> A break from what?<eos> Dead end after dead end?
- no, no no. - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> That was a... very thorough answer.<eos> Next round of shots on me?<eos> Look, even if I agreed with you that April is a festering boil on the ass of the dart world... which I don't... you still need a partner.<eos> No partner and you're out of the tourney.<eos> She quit, Becky!<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> What about playing with her?<eos> Who?

Yes.<eos> You know, I-I actually had a horse when I was a kid.<eos> - Really? - You did? - Oh, wow.<eos> Horst.<eos> Horst?<eos> He was a, uh, Albino.<eos> He was actually sold to a circus and, um, he didn't make it.<eos> Heartbreaking story, Stosh.<eos> I know, I still have issues.<eos> About Horst, the Albino?
Horst?<eos> He was a, uh, Albino.<eos> He was actually sold to a circus and, um, he didn't make it.<eos> Heartbreaking story, Stosh.<eos> I know, I still have issues.<eos> About Horst, the Albino?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, uh, ladies, it's about, uh, six hours past my bedtime, so... I'm leaving.<eos> Oh, well, it was fun hanging out with you, Stosh.<eos> Yeah, you, too.
I ran my ass out of there.<eos> All right, then you did nothing wrong.<eos> Well, then why do I feel like crap?<eos> Maybe because you been flirting with her all week, you didn't leave the bar when you should have, and you ended the night smooching up on some strange.<eos> Oh, God, how am I gonna tell Molly about this?<eos> You don't.<eos> You don't say a word.<eos> You keep those kissable lips shut.<eos> But... I just...<eos> Shut.
- OK? - Yeah.<eos> OK.<eos> Uh, I've got to drop something off.<eos> I'll meet you guys at the car.<eos> What happened to your family camping trip?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey.<eos> Free for dinner?<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> So what about Idyllwild?
It's my first month on the job and I've got students staging a walkout.<eos> I felt less pressure managing multi-million dollar businesses.<eos> - It's a hard job.<eos> - And that's why I need your help.<eos> Hi, I'm Dan Cruz.<eos> I'm here to meet with Jesus.<eos> Well, no one's here except, a bunch of my guy friends on the football team.<eos> Well, um, we had an appointment.<eos> You had an appointment?<eos> With Jesus?
No... maybe... probably not.<eos> [Mariana] They offered him a scholarship.<eos> [both] Academic?<eos> No.<eos> Wrestling.<eos> And the school's in Colorado.<eos> I thought you said I could go.<eos> I never said I'd be happy about it.<eos> And you're probably gonna have to move in with Jude.<eos> - Jude?
Yes, Your Honor.<eos> I still strongly believe that my daughter belongs with me, but I'm willing to wait until we've had a chance to get to know each other better.<eos> Callie, this is what you want?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And ladies, I'm assuming this is OK with you?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> We... we just want Callie to feel safe.<eos> OK.<eos> We'll go back to the original plan.<eos> With one amendment.
Turns out she's not a dilettante after all.<eos> Hey.<eos> I just found out we have a new, old English teacher.<eos> What can I say, your daughter made a very convincing argument.<eos> Maybe she should be the lawyer.<eos> Don't think it hasn't crossed her minds.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you want to have lunch today?<eos> - Love to.
When I was a kid, if you got bullied, there were physical signs.<eos> Cuts, bruises-- you couldn't hide it.<eos> I should've taken her computer out of her room. Limited her phone access.<eos> She would've figured out a way to get online.<eos> This is addictive behavior.<eos> Teens stay up all night texting, messaging, surfing the web.<eos> It's called vamping.<eos> Is there anyone you can think of who would want to lash out at Zoey like this?<eos> Did she have a fight with anyone?<eos> A girlfriend?

Which could push her to follow through on her threats of revenge.<eos> Well, we need to find her before that happens.<eos> I'll send units over to Flintwood High.<eos> There is not gonna be a school shooting on my watch.<eos> Zoey posted again.<eos> Another video.<eos> "You should think twice about cyberbullying.<eos> Especially if your dad works for the FBI."<eos> This was done in my son's bedroom.<eos> From his computer.
- There is no chance... - Enough!<eos> The both of you!<eos> If we have any hope of getting through this alive, this is our only chance.<eos> You want to be alone?<eos> This is a big, safe house to be alone in...<eos> With someone who can watch you.<eos> Why don't you watch her?<eos> Because I have a body to move.<eos> I have to clean up your mess.<eos> My mess? !
More likely I was wrong and misjudged him.<eos> I mean...<eos> Daniel didn't need alcohol to get violent and angry with me.<eos> I was actually just talking to Daniel's girlfriend about that.<eos> Margaux LeMarchal?<eos> She swore up and down that Daniel wasn't angry or violent or anything.<eos> You know, in fact, according to her, he was as happy as she'd ever seen him.<eos> He was excited that he was gonna be a father.<eos> I'm sorry, did you just say...<eos> A father?
I am the warden.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I came to help get you out.<eos> You came out of curiosity.<eos> Or maybe I actually care about what happens to you.<eos> Your government is being robbed.<eos> From here?<eos> How?<eos> What's he after?<eos> The Fulcrum.
I couldn't touch you.<eos> I wanted to do things the right way in your case...<eos> It... Yeah.<eos> - I weren't able to. - No.<eos> Unfortunately.<eos> - That's it. - Yeah.<eos> That's it.<eos> Can I see him?<eos> Please?<eos> Debit or cash?
Oh, guess who also works in the garden-- look.<eos> Am I supposed to know who the fuck you're pointing at?<eos> The guy with the glasses.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's Ellis Hightower.<eos> You know, we planted carrots in the garden the other day.<eos> It's no biggie, it's whatever.<eos> Do you want to meet him?<eos> No, not really.
I'm Jeannie van der Hooven.<eos> A very ambitious consultant from Kaan Associates. Ah.<eos> I understand your firm's been through a rough patch.<eos> Well, bowed but not broken, sir. As you can see.<eos> And willing to work on a performance-tied fee structure.<eos> You know, our experience suggests that Celetech can maintain a science-based true north while still adding to...<eos> Okay, I'm gonna cut you off there. We've been with Demark for years.<eos> And I'm not gonna be dropping them just so I can go into business with Marty Kaan.<eos> Well, you wouldn't be. Marty is no longer a part of the company.<eos> In any case.
Chung, innit?<eos> Chung?<eos> That's very funny, cos I think one of your boys just killed her.<eos> Callum Greene.<eos> He's one of your Mash men, ain't he?<eos> I wonder how many of those boys out there know that you've been a snitch since before Cool Britannia was all the thing?<eos> I mean, we know what they'd think about that, though, don't we?<eos> They'd end your days on earth, Errol.<eos> Let's have a word.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.
Before I end it for you.<eos> You do know they saw you...<eos> my boy, my daughter-in-law.<eos> They clocked your face, they clocked your car.<eos> How long do you think you've got before my firm are popping your eyeballs out with their thumbs?<eos> Yeah. I don't care, George, you don't scare me.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> All right.<eos> What it is... she comes to me, your girl.<eos> Different name.
Hey, Abigail.<eos> Great to see you, too.<eos> Well, Lasalle, how you been, man?<eos> Agent Brody, CGIS Hi.<eos> Special Agent Abigail Borin.<eos> We had the most fun I've ever had on a joint-undercover op.<eos> Yeah, a bar, hotel room, lot of sweaty hot bayou love.<eos> - Sounds like fun.<eos> - Not us.<eos> - Not between us.
Oh, right, it's Shannon.<eos> That's right, it was Shannon.<eos> Being an astronaut made her the perfect alien.<eos> She knew how to adjust the frequency of a micro-radar transmitter... to turn it into a devastating sonic weapon.<eos> Like, that explains the alien's mind beams.<eos> She used Sly's magnaboots to defy gravity.<eos> And she knew how to use holograms... videos and audio recordings to mask her whereabouts at any moment.<eos> And she knew the ship and the resort so she could come and go at will.<eos> It was a plan years in the making by a highly-trained expert.<eos> Yes. An expert.
We're about to enter the atmosphere.<eos> Ms. Lucas, Ms. Lucas?<eos> And it was this terrible alien that destroyed the station and my friends.<eos> Space is no place for the average person, it's for trained astronauts like me.<eos> That's a great story... if it were true.<eos> And just to be certain you never leave... I've planted thermal charges like this one throughout the complex.<eos> You can't put a price on this sort of fame.<eos> Besides, returning as a hero will bring me all the money I could ever want.<eos> She was the alien.<eos> A fake alien.
- Get out!<eos> - God!<eos> - You are such an asshole.<eos> - Get out!<eos> I wish you were dead!<eos> Where's Gretchen?<eos> Jimmy, I'm moving out.<eos> I'm so sorry, but the time has come for me to strike out on my own, and I...<eos> Ooh, you have to get a place with a pool.<eos> Or a gym.
So what?<eos> Go!<eos> Hey, I know it's cliché, but, really, what-what if there were no possessions?<eos> Can you imagine that?<eos> Uh, do you guys know my girlfriend, Gretchen?<eos> She's supposed to be here.<eos> She got sad for a long time.<eos> That was hard.<eos> I'm used to being the complicated one.<eos> Like, with-with Becca.
Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> How much money?<eos> So much.<eos> Good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got a new hobby.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm gonna talk to someone about it.<eos> A doctor someone.
~ Good day?<eos> Bad day?<eos> Jill walked 122 steps today.<eos> A personal best since the accident.<eos> He thinks I'm able to start reducing the anti-inflammatories soon.<eos> I'm going to have a soak, but he's made some chicken with mango coleslaw if you fancy.<eos> Oh...<eos> Simon!<eos> The dragon said, "I'm sad because I want to be like you, Mouse -<eos> "small and furry and warm.
No, just... - You miss her. - Yeah.<eos> Well, maybe this will help.<eos> Vickie, give it to him.<eos> Thanks, Vickie, it's beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love drawing again.<eos> You know, there's another way you can keep her alive.<eos> When you're not sure what you should do, ask yourself what Audrey would want you to do, and do that.<eos> That's what I do with Duke.<eos> Duke.
So that's who's in my parking spot.<eos> Less-secure woman than myself might worry you were looking over her shoulder.<eos> Hey, it's free coffee.<eos> Plus, the docs gave me the green light to start driving, so I'm celebrating.<eos> If you were celebrating, you'd be at the gun range.<eos> That's exactly where I'm going right after I get your take on something.<eos> - Something about Raylan?<eos> - Why, no, as it happens.<eos> Wasn't the hale task force one of the first jobs you worked?<eos> First big one, anyway.
Every time?<eos> Even last night?<eos> I'm not doing it.<eos> Hey.<eos> We have something, okay?<eos> I need your help.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> On one condition.
Gord?<eos> We have a problem.<eos> Well, obviously, the antibiotics aren't working.<eos> Every last one of them now has mastitis.<eos> How bad is it, Gord?<eos> If we can't get this under control, we lose our only source of milk inside the fence.<eos> When we had problems with the animals, my father used a liniment oil.<eos> Worked wonders.<eos> Even for something like this?<eos> Pretty much for everything.
Where's your dad?<eos> Why?<eos> Because the man he hired to burn down your building is gonna kill him.<eos> - No, you're wrong...<eos> - We don't have time to argue.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - He's at the building.<eos> I-I was just on my way to meet him.<eos> He's with one of your arson investigators.<eos> Who?
Well, you changed, too.<eos> You used to live by your own rules.<eos> You were like a fat, Jewish Dennis Rodman.<eos> But look at you now.<eos> You're like the back of a horse in a two-person horse costume with Gina just farting in your face all day long.<eos> That actually happened.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Schmidt, tell me, what do you get for all your hard work?<eos> - The sponge account.
All the time.<eos> Are you living with her?<eos> No, Helen, I'm not.<eos> First position, ladies.<eos> Port de bras.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Open.<eos> Gorgeous.<eos> And up.<eos> Other side.
Other side.<eos> Reach through those fingertips.<eos> Rise up on your toes, and bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée.<eos> Plié.<eos> And up.<eos> Let's rise up again, up on your toes.<eos> Bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée, bourrée...<eos> Anyway, the worst part is that he did the whole thing right under her nose, while they were staying at her mother's house.<eos> The whole family?<eos> Kids and all.
no more phone.<eos> Let's stick with this for a minute.<eos> Let's look at these looks.<eos> You feel some sort of judgment from Alison?<eos> I guess.<eos> This isn't the first time you've brought this up in here.<eos> I remember you said something similar about Whitney.<eos> I did?<eos> Yes, how the last time you saw her, she looked at you with tremendous scorn.<eos> Disappointment.
I guess.<eos> This isn't the first time you've brought this up in here.<eos> I remember you said something similar about Whitney.<eos> I did?<eos> Yes, how the last time you saw her, she looked at you with tremendous scorn.<eos> Disappointment.<eos> And then there was the way you described how Helen looked at you when you first told her about Alison.<eos> I don't understand where you're going with this.<eos> So these three women in your life, you describe as looking at you in similar ways.<eos> With... With judgment.
Something serious and significant.<eos> So do you notice that the words you use to describe Bradley's life...<eos> "big," "significant," "great"... you're now using them to describe your new book.<eos> Well, he's the subject of the book.<eos> But what I'm interested in is how this subject relates to your own life.<eos> In your mind.<eos> I want to know...<eos> I want to know if it's possible, really possible to be both.<eos> Both?<eos> A good man and a great man.
Ali, it's me.<eos> Just have a seat.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, you ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The Lobster Roll.<eos> What about it?<eos> I want to buy it.<eos> With you.
- I'm trying to tell you.<eos> You killed a major drug dealer's son, and now he wants you dead... that makes sense.<eos> But what makes no sense to me is why are you trying to protect him.<eos> If it was a short answer, I'd have given it to you.<eos> Notgonnahappen.<eos> You're going to Stanford.<eos> You're getting an education.<eos> Come on.<eos> I do this crap so you won't have to.<eos> This crap?
Are you open to that?<eos> Claire?<eos> I'll fly out in the morning.<eos> No, no.<eos> You can come in the afternoon.<eos> You don't have to do any events or press, just... be there with me when I make my speech.<eos> - I said yes.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Last night...
What is it?<eos> This is a reflecting telescope.<eos> It's the very latest of its kind.<eos> Look.<eos> What is that?<eos> They are the constellations.<eos> Only closer.<eos> You were right, this is a marvel. Yes.<eos> This one's mirror was cast, ground, and polished by William Herschel himself.<eos> William...?

Beautiful sky tonight.<eos> I find myself constantly impressed by modern science.<eos> It gives me hope to hear it for we are at the birth of a new age, Anna.<eos> A struggle between men of reason and men of blood, of base instinct, contending for the soul of mankind.<eos> Damn you.<eos> Skulking in here like Indians.<eos> Who...<eos> Travel safe.<eos> A war between men who desire civility and those who crave savagery.<eos> Between those golden in head and heart and those red in tooth and claw.
Why?<eos> Helno, the singer with Les Négresses Vertes, is compared to the Pogues' singer but they're nothing alike.<eos> - Know why?<eos> - No.<eos> Vision.<eos> Helno is nuts.<eos> That's why he's so funny.<eos> I saw him live.<eos> He came out looking like this...<eos> Just like this.
But I've progressed!<eos> Last year, I worked for a realtor.<eos> The boss had problems, so I had to quit.<eos> And I worked too much.<eos> I overdid it.<eos> But she told me to work like that.<eos> I didn't know it would be a problem...<eos> Plus I'm subletting.<eos> I was living with my aunt but we don't speak anymore.<eos> My uncle neither.
Is passing out knowing you're about to get rained on.<eos> So, moss found somewhere dry.<eos> Try a playground if there is one. [ engine turns over ]<eos> I've slept in tunnels And giant, concrete tubes, pirate ships, you name it. [ woman screams ]<eos> You know what?<eos> Man: I got him! You might be onto something.<eos> Up you go.<eos> [ groans ] If you drink alcohol like you drink coffee, No surprise we found you facedown,<eos> Passed out in a tunnel. I had an empty stomach, But I can usually hold my beer better.<eos> No raspberry malt beverage?
I brought some pictures to help you remember me.<eos> I don't need pictures.<eos> I know exactly who you are.<eos> You do?<eos> You're Rosie.<eos> I am Rosie!<eos> You're right!<eos> How could I ever forget you?<eos> You're the best maid my wife and I ever had.<eos> Your wife?
They hang out in the basement.<eos> They were his best friends.<eos> They would never have anything to do with his death if that's what you're thinking.<eos> So, Brad's mom doesn't have a problem with you guys setting up in her basement?<eos> I mean, Brad was the one who brought the three of us together.<eos> You know?<eos> Like, inspired us.<eos> He got me believing I could actually make a difference.<eos> And change the world, you know?<eos> But why like this?
How could David have been so far off with his estimate?<eos> I don't think it was his fault.<eos> It was that truck engine.<eos> It really was running.<eos> Killer must've left it that way after the murder.<eos> But that engine would've kept that dead body warm though.<eos> Throwing off David's calculations when he did the liver stick.<eos> Okay, so new time of death.<eos> That would put Agrerro's murder just a little bit after Brad Jeffries was killed in the alley, right?<eos> Probably first thing in the morning.
Any... any scar, it would be very minimal.<eos> Ah. Every time she looks in a mirror, she'll remember this.<eos> My kids...<eos> They lost everything.<eos> They have you.<eos> I don't... I'm not sure how good that is.<eos> Look, I missed this.<eos> You know, I...<eos> Whatever was happening...<eos> With Brooke...
- Mm-hmm. - I like that.<eos> You know, I know this community.<eos> If you give me those pills back, I'll have your money back within the week and I will double Ramon's weight.<eos> You know, I got to say, the soap thing is pretty genius.<eos> She's calling.<eos> Hey, Cosima, it's me.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> Long story.<eos> It turns out Castor Mark was undercover for the military.<eos> With the Proletheans?
- Now you have to work with them?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> - But are you OK?<eos> - Yeah, I'm OK.<eos> I'm just thinking.<eos> But it was really nice to meet you.<eos> Let's see each other again.<eos> Yeah, I want to do that.<eos> Maybe I come to you...<eos> Yeah, what about my cacao, by the way?
Stop right there before you say something you'll regret.<eos> I do not like the person you're becoming.<eos> _<eos> It's almost 4:00.<eos> I hate this.<eos> I can feel our minutes slipping away.<eos> _<eos> So, do you have an early class tomorrow?<eos> _<eos> With Skye?
Hey, Commodore.<eos> What's Lieutenant Foster doing with you?<eos> Crazy witch doctor tried to get the cure from Kara.<eos> I killed him, sir.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Quincy's dead.<eos> Can your men help get them out of here?<eos> Take them.<eos> On me.
I masturbate in the mirror!<eos> Me too!<eos> That's what's so hot about it.<eos> It's like hooking up with yourself.<eos> I know, but...<eos> I have sex with people different from me, you know?<eos> Different colors, different shapes, different sizes.<eos> People who are hotter, uglier.<eos> More smart, not more smart.<eos> Innies, outies.
I'm hearing a "but" coming.<eos> But I'm here to restore order in an office that is under intense scrutiny.<eos> I've been tasked with ushering in a new era of transparency, and frankly, you might want to think about whether you fit into it.<eos> Ouch. Guess losing an eye to one of Joe's followers hasn't improved his attitude.<eos> Yeah. It doesn't matter.<eos> We're full speed ahead on this, no matter what Nick Donovan says.<eos> Hey, Max.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I've been cleared for duty.<eos> Yeah. Limited duty.
Are you ok?<eos> Mm-hmm. Ahem.<eos> Just recovering from an altercation with a piece of lumber.<eos> Sounds like quite a story.<eos> Oh, it's not.<eos> I lost.<eos> End of story.<eos> Is there a bathroom in this maze?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> That way, around the corner.
How can they not believe you after all you've done for them?<eos> It's--it's just downright insulting.<eos> Damn straight.<eos> Uh, they clearly don't appreciate your talents and capabilities the way I do.<eos> I--I believe in you, Ryan.<eos> Do you?<eos> Of course.<eos> I will always be there for you.<eos> I am your constant and your--your true north, and when everyone else has abandoned you, where will I be?<eos> By my side.
I mean, it's gonna take some time, - but yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> We need the names and the seat numbers for those passengers with the phones, and we need them now.<eos> Let's go, Elijah.<eos> Nelson.<eos> Okay, all right, all right, got it.<eos> All right, thanks, Krummy.<eos> Okay, target's sitting in 14C.<eos> Plane is taxiing to the gate right now.<eos> Good, what about the other flights?
Look, I'll-I'll admit it-- there's not a whole lot that I know about what you and your people do.<eos> That's not an enviable position.<eos> You're not gonna try and hug me now, are you?<eos> No.<eos> In fact, my job practically guarantees I am gonna be a constant pain in your ass.<eos> But listen, I'm the least of your worries.<eos> Tomorrow's criminal.<eos> That is who you're gonna lose sleep over.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.
That's okay.<eos> I can probably be talked into giving you a do-over.<eos> You have an eraser on that thing?<eos> Yeah, it's a magic.<eos> Hey.<eos> Denna, this is...<eos> Aimee.<eos> It's good to see you again. Good to see you, too.<eos> Maybe I could get a couple shots of you two together?<eos> Of course. Maybe over by the desk?
In fact, most of my nights are booked, but I could probably do a lunch.<eos> Okay, I see what's happening here.<eos> What's happening?<eos> You think I'm asking you out.<eos> What does that say about your self-esteem?<eos> It's either so sky high that with you about to pop you think I'm trying to get in your maternity pants, or it's so low that your brain doesn't go to "maybe he just wants to talk about that soon-to-be-open CFO position."<eos> You're offering me the CFO position?<eos> Did I say I was offering it to you? I said I wanted to talk about it.<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> Between you and me...
He could be zombie McCartney to your zombie Lennon.<eos> What I know is, another year on his meal plan and my trust fund will be zombie tapped.<eos> How does it work, anyway?<eos> Well, in my case it involved a father who had the good fortune to inherit a coal mine.<eos> Not your trust fund.<eos> Blaine's service.<eos> They send a menu.<eos> Changes every few weeks.<eos> "Motor Cortex Asada, Basil Parietal Terrine,<eos> "Cerebellum Sashimi..."
New clothes, new bag, Manelli's.<eos> What?<eos> This is really cone of silence, though.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, I met this guy.<eos> Why didn't you say so?<eos> I didn't want to say something until there was something to say.<eos> Is there something to say?<eos> No.<eos> Not like that.

Can I talk to you for one second?<eos> Uh, you are interrupting.<eos> It's kind of important.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Uh, excuse me?<eos> So, Cal... anyway...<eos> how have you been? Uh, I could really use your help with Ellis and Maya right now.<eos> Jeannie, I was in the middle of something back there...<eos> Oh, yeah, I saw.<eos> With, uh, Cal Manchester. The president of Compass Oil.
Thanks. Try this out.<eos> So... how you been?<eos> Here's a fun little fact:<eos> The word "fortune" comes from the Latin word Fortuna, goddess of chance.<eos> Fortuna-- so pretty, right?<eos> Thing is, real fortune has nothing to do with chance.<eos> Or luck. Fortuna is bullshit.<eos> Real fortune is calculated.<eos> It's relentless.<eos> Fucking criminal, even.
It's the greatest thing.<eos> It expressed the way I felt socially and politically, and it was the anger that I felt, the alienation.<eos> And I realized that this is what I've always wanted to do.<eos> ♪ Fill me in on your new vision ♪<eos> ♪ Wake me up with indecision ♪<eos> ♪ Help me trust your mighty wisdom... ♪<eos> ♪ I'm new, I'm new, I'm who, I'm you ♪<eos> Just the fact that we were actually playing music live in a room, it was amazing. It was, like, the most incredible thing I've ever done.<eos> ♪ Easy in an easy chair ♪<eos> ♪ Poop as hard as rock ♪
You could have just mentioned the vile Courtney, but, oh, no, you went so far as to show her kissing Kurt.<eos> Blech!<eos> I will never forgive you.<eos> Never, never, never!<eos> Sincerely disillusioned with life, Stacy the Kurt slave."<eos> And there's a little happy face on the bottom. Happy face... "This is not currently me, thanks to you."<eos> Why don't... Why don't you interview us? Kurt and Courtney?<eos> - This is slow. It's too slow. - "Sassy 2."<eos> How does it feel to be fast? Life in the fast lane.<eos> At the height of their drug abuse...
Here.<eos> I can do it.<eos> All right.<eos> Bye.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> (Woman) Mr. Apostolou?<eos> I'm Mr. Korkoulis' assistant, Runya Stamos.<eos> So nice to meet you.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Pleasure.
That's a lot of tar.<eos> The bones come up in the bucket.<eos> We take the asphalt off, and then the close-in work... We use these.<eos> Looks like something my dentist uses.<eos> That's just what it is... a dental pick.<eos> And this bone comes from this excavation pit.<eos> It's human.<eos> And our job here is to find as much of her as we can, document it, and try to understand what happened to her.<eos> So, you're sort of like my dad, except you deal with really cold cases.<eos> The coldest.
You're under arrest for murder.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> This is harassment.<eos> - I said shut up.<eos> Bosch.<eos> Told you not to come in.<eos> We had this.<eos> Why'd you fire?<eos> He was headed for the fire escape, so I knocked him down with a beanbag round.<eos> Nice work.
You have the video.<eos> I did. And I do.<eos> But this is bureau politics, Bosch.<eos> Above your pay grade, as you say.<eos> This grand jury is O'Shae's way of enforcing our, um... understanding.<eos> Anyway, I wanted you to be prepared.<eos> I also understand that you arrested John Stokes for Arthur Delacroix's murder.<eos> I'm on my way to the D.A.'s office to file charges after we're done here.<eos> Good. If he's charged, it won't be a problem.<eos> Problem?
They don't know I'm paying you a visit.<eos> There's a reason I came to you alone.<eos> Why? Because you and I have something in common,<eos> Something those two would never understand. You and I are about to be mothers.<eos> [ whispers ] You're pregnant?<eos> Now you get why we must stop this curse.<eos> For our children.<eos> [ sighs ]<eos> No.<eos> What?
There.<eos> Whoa!<eos> God, those stitches are gorgeous!<eos> I got the intrafallopian transfer in ten minutes!<eos> I can't do it like this!<eos> Wait, c-could-- can you do it?<eos> Wow, me? Imagine, me...<eos> The child of immigrants...<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Okay, nobody.
And you didn't feel the need to bring me in on that plan?<eos> I felt the exact opposite.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Harvey, Louis wanted to see you suffer.<eos> If I had told you, you would have had to fake it, and you're a shitty actor.<eos> Excuse me, but I can act.<eos> No, everybody thinks they can act, Harvey.<eos> The fact of the matter is, well, you're just a pretty face.<eos> Oh, you think I'm pretty?<eos> Pretty stupid.
See you all later.<eos> Hey, Jason get Vernon's new deal done yet?<eos> Call him yourself.<eos> He'd love to hear from you.<eos> Best hope he does. Only way you're gonna get your 300 back.<eos> It ain't about the money, Reg.<eos> I'm just trying to do what's right for Vern.<eos> Look out for his best interests.<eos> By lining your pockets up with his cash.<eos> What cash?
Lucky charm from my girl. All right?<eos> At least another 20,000.<eos> What the hell I want that for if I got to change my number?<eos> You could sell this, man.<eos> Or better yet-- better yet, you could take the number 81. Flip the digits. My jeweler is accommodating, all right?<eos> - He's got mad skills. - And he gonna need them skills.<eos> No sale, new guy.<eos> Cute chain, though.<eos> He like that with everyone?<eos> Just you.
They have a secret.<eos> You think Adele lied to me.<eos> Adele is married, and if she's got a jealous husband...<eos> John could be in danger.<eos> Well, that about wraps it up for us tonight.<eos> Security cameras will be installed tomorrow morning, and I'll be here tonight patrolling the perimeter.<eos> OK. Um, thank you.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Good night, sir.<eos> Good night.
No prints, but our stalker's definitely creative.<eos> What about Alice Vargas?<eos> Alice Vargas, 21, no family.<eos> Her mother died last month.<eos> IRS records show she made $21,000 last year, yet she lives in the Bradford Arms apartments.<eos> 10 bucks says the mayor's paying her rent.<eos> Actually, the rent's being automatically withdrawn from Alice's personal account.<eos> You can owe me.<eos> So where's Alice getting her money from?<eos> World's oldest profession.
You heading home?<eos> Yeah.<eos> In a little bit.<eos> How's Ethan?<eos> He enjoyed spending time with you, Jack.<eos> Same here.<eos> Maybe we can do it again.<eos> Ethan was hoping to see you this weekend if you're free.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Very much.
George's credit card statement.<eos> Last purchase was on the 23rd... Day after Holden's release.<eos> It was a bus ticket from Live Oak to Paulie...<eos> Round trip.<eos> And Mr. Melton's phone was never used after the 23rd, either.<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Just the pinging to the tower for the next few days.<eos> Anything else on the Holden front?<eos> Just the more people I talk to, the more narrow his window of opportunity becomes.<eos> But not impossible.

We all do that sometimes.<eos> I got it all mixed up.<eos> And it wasn't love. It was... Insanity.<eos> You're gonna get help where you're going.<eos> Like Humpty Dumpty?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Mom says that there are people there who have been through what you've been through.<eos> Not exactly, maybe, but similar.<eos> And who will I be when they put me back together again?<eos> My brother.
- No, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Sheriff, I'm not suggesting that.<eos> What was George worried about, Chris?<eos> Really?<eos> Well...<eos> H-he didn't get into it with me.<eos> Didn't get into what he was worried about with you?<eos> Unfortunately, no.<eos> Do you see yourself as a good man, Chris?<eos> A good man?
Toodle pip.<eos> Hey.<eos> We've got Steven Rose leaving the building at 21:32pm.<eos> We follow him down here, down here and then... well, he's gone.<eos> Off camera. Yeah.<eos> How many bodies we got looking for him?<eos> All of them, I think.<eos> - Aerial units.<eos> Ground units.<eos> Dog units.
What?<eos> What was that?<eos> Sorry. Erm...<eos> Theo and me... DCI Bloom...<eos> He quite liked the odd Star Wars reference.<eos> "Not this ship, sister."<eos> Do you know any David Bowie?<eos> Erm... Yeah, I liked him in, in that film.<eos> The one in the maze.<eos> With the baby.

And I did tell someone.<eos> Because you said that I could trust you.<eos> I know.<eos> You promised.<eos> - You did nothing.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> I was ten years old!<eos> Too petrified to sleep.<eos> Do you know what happens to someone, when they don't sleep?<eos> - To their mind?
One of yours?<eos> He was.<eos> This what you were pounding in Lexington while we were pounding doors?<eos> Show the lady a little respect.<eos> Oh, chivalrous.<eos> You're not in a position to tell me shit.<eos> Now sit your ass down, both of you.<eos> What exactly are you after?<eos> Call it severance pay.<eos> Severance?
Well, actually, Avery called me and told me some bald, wrinkled asshole of a marshal was giving him grief, and I said,<eos> "why, I would recognize that description anywhere."<eos> Oh, that really doesn't ring a bell.<eos> What's it been, like 14 years?<eos> I wasn't even bald back then.<eos> - Well, maybe a little.<eos> - Yeah, that was a long time ago, which makes me wonder why you are so concerned about who ratted out my husband way back then.<eos> Oh, you know, I'm sitting there, recuperating from gunshot, watching all that "forensic files" unsolved mystery bullshit on TV, and then I hear about the shit hitting the fan with your boy toy, Markham, down in Harlan, and... got my curiosity up.<eos> Well, when you find that snitch, what are you gonna do with him?<eos> Or her.

Not grooves ... grubes.<eos> He's a man I know ... sort of.<eos> Lives up in them hills, like a wildcat, - but he ain't no hill person.<eos> - He ain't one of us, either.<eos> He'll get you to the other side of that mountain.<eos> Of that, I'm certain.<eos> But I don't know what he will want in return.<eos> I don't think money means so much to a fellow like that.<eos> Well, I'm gonna want to talk to him ...<eos> Him or the pig-shit guy ...
- Did you kill him?<eos> - What?<eos> No! Ava, you're a fugitive from the law.<eos> I know you shot your fiancé and I know that Raylan took my Crown Vic.<eos> And I tracked it up here.<eos> Now, for the last time ...<eos> The answer to the question is "no!" I ain't even seen him.<eos> I hope for your sake, and for the sake of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that you are telling the truth.<eos> Now... lace your fingers behind your head.<eos> Behind your head!
You can go if you want.<eos> No, I'll stay.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Your room is ready.<eos> Yes, Mom.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> If you change your mind, you know you're welcome.<eos> Alright, then...<eos> I'll call you in the morning.<eos> Or tonight.
Many of his employees say he was at work.<eos> He might well be a nasty bastard, but he's not the axe killer.<eos> - Do you know him? - Yes.<eos> That's him.<eos> He was with a woman.<eos> Here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nobody believed in my innocence.<eos> Thank God they arrested Berger, because your lousy alibi...<eos> "Lousy"...
I want to say that...<eos> I want to say...<eos> I'm too old for this stuff.<eos> OK, Jeanne!<eos> Thanks for the coffee.<eos> See you later.<eos> See you later.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to tell you I spoke with Dr. Blanchot.<eos> - The leech.
Yes. It's true.<eos> That's very nice.<eos> I'm very happy to be here.<eos> Your father is wonderful.<eos> Dad, "wonderful?"<eos> If you need anything, just ask.<eos> We know Dad can be a bit difficult.<eos> He needs a lot of attention and isn't always easy going.<eos> Really? He seems charming to me.<eos> Really? "Charming?" Well, good for you.
That won't be easy.<eos> Hello.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll sit down, if you insist.<eos> So you're the famous Richard?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why? What did you expect?<eos> No.<eos> You're perfect. You're exactly as I imagined.<eos> Friendly and pleasant.
Once we know where he is, we can come after him for real.<eos> I'm in a hallway?<eos> A... nondescript hallway.<eos> No sign of...<eos> Whoa, John...<eos> Where are you now?<eos> There's a podium.<eos> It's... copper, or bronze?<eos> - Coated in plasma?<eos> - Plasma?
Hey. Look what I found.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I have been looking all over for it.<eos> I bet.<eos> How can I repay you?<eos> With blood.<eos> Hector.<eos> So, do you want to talk about any of it?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Eventually.
No, I've never seen him before. Who is he?<eos> 23-year-old from Phoenix.<eos> He's got a couple of misdemeanors for drug possession.<eos> Why would she be hanging out with a guy like that?<eos> Where is she, Nick?<eos> Can I see her?<eos> We don't know where she is.<eos> What?<eos> When's the last time you saw her?<eos> Uh... at 10:00 this morning.
What do I even do with this?<eos> I don't know what to do with this?<eos> Use it, bitch.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Abbi?<eos> There you are.<eos> I'm always looking for you, I love it.<eos> (English accent) So there's a bloody (Bleep) spill in the spin studio.<eos> (Chuckling) But really, there's a bloody (Bleep) spill<eos> - in the spin studio.
We remember you...<eos> 'Cause your hair and lipstick looks cute.<eos> I can give you $13,000 in store credit or $903 in cash.<eos> Woo-hoo, store credit for life!<eos> Dude, I need the money.<eos> Money, right, money, money.<eos> Speaking of which, how much is my aunt's timeless, beautiful, classic apothecary bag?<eos> $226.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> By the way...
We need whiteboards, corkboards, laptops.<eos> A bunch of clocks with different times on them, a red phone, a big tabletop map with little Nazi tanks, and/or a Godzilla.<eos> The ad airs at 7 A.M.<eos> That means we have four hours and 13 minutes to figure out what they're throwing at us and how to respond.<eos> You know, it's the darndest thing, I think Britta somehow crapped in my pants too.<eos> Uh-huh, better head home.<eos> Jeff, you can't just leave a situation room.<eos> It's only a situation room, because she called it that.<eos> I mean I could declare it a...<eos> Cookie room!
City College try to embarrass us?<eos> We should embarrass them, right?<eos> Right.<eos> I say I go to City College with a camera, shoot a really gross porno movie on their campus and put it online.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> It's very inspiring to watch you work.<eos> You are inspiring, too.<eos> In what way?
Sure.<eos> The thing you said back there about not being a part of anything.<eos> Is that really how you feel?<eos> It's not a question of how I feel.<eos> I feel like flying.<eos> I don't jump off buildings.<eos> Do you believe in God, Warburton?<eos> You know, there's no rule that says we have to be friends, right?<eos> How about common courtesy?<eos> Familiar with that rule?
Okay. I just gotta ask.<eos> What was so special about this Troy person?<eos> Did he own a rainbow?<eos> Was he the group's pharmacist?<eos> We don't like to talk about it.<eos> But you often do.<eos> I'm a problem solver give me information.<eos> I'll handle this.<eos> Troy was very gifted at steel drums.<eos> Steel drums.
Cool.<eos> So, our DJ was going to man the frozen yogurt machine.<eos> Is that something you guys can handle?<eos> If you do need anything reached, I've been practicing.<eos> We like Avatar?<eos> In public, yes.<eos> We like things most people like.<eos> Our job isn't to alienate people.<eos> We're on the job with my parents?<eos> With everyone, everywhere, all the time.
It has.<eos> How are you and Alicia?<eos> Fine.<eos> No.<eos> No, you haven't been.<eos> Well, life's... complicated.<eos> It is.<eos> Still believe?<eos> Do I believe in God?<eos> At times.
Hey. I don't want to be rude, but this sex is pretty time sensitive.<eos> Okay?<eos> So we really got to buckle down here.<eos> And remember, this lovemaking is to save the human race.<eos> - And that's a big deal.<eos> - Phil, another person just showed up.<eos> Wow, check out this setup, huh?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, don't touch that.<eos> That orgasm was generously provided by<eos> Phil Miller.
What?<eos> Another person?<eos> Yeah, some friggin' fat dude named Todd.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This is the best news.<eos> Melissa can repopulate with him now and our babies won't have to have sex with each other.<eos> Well, we're not out of the water just yet.<eos> Why are we still in the water?<eos> Well, I just have a real hunch that Melissa would way prefer to have sex with me over this<eos> - Todd character.
For you or for the patient?<eos> And I chose Heath Ledger, because he wasn't a bad person.<eos> I mean, they were prescription drugs.<eos> Okay, yes, I'll be right there.<eos> And she gave me a B-plus because she said I used too many online sources.<eos> That's fantastic, honey.<eos> It... it is?<eos> Mark, what are you talking about?<eos> She said she got a B.<eos> B-plus.
Not if he keeps ending up in here.<eos> You've been more patient than doctor lately, Doctor.<eos> Yeah, I guess I'm just accident-prone.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's the problem.<eos> Okay, well, uh, there's no signs of a concussion.<eos> A few minor abrasions and bruises.<eos> You're lucky you didn't break anything.<eos> Maybe next time you should take the elevator.<eos> Yes.<eos> Elevator?
Yeah, it could be a coincidence.<eos> Or it isn't.<eos> And if it's not, if it is... fate or destiny or whatever you want to call it, then Cat could be making the biggest mistake of her life by quitting.<eos> Because if she and Vincent are meant to be together, and not just for love, then they do have a greater purpose, one that they can't quit.<eos> I'm sorry, it just all sounds so far-fetched.<eos> Like beasts and superhumans aren't?<eos> Okay.<eos> There's somebody I want you to talk to.<eos> Somebody that knows more about this stuff than anybody.<eos> Who?

Are you okay?<eos> Define "okay."<eos> Oh, crazy life you lead, Cat.<eos> Really crazy.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Keep trying to figure out ways to change it.<eos> I don't think you can.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Guess who I met today.<eos> Your father.
It purportedly chronicles myths in pre-Christian Europe.<eos> Didn't think you'd be interested in that sort of thing.<eos> Which one?<eos> What else is on the agenda for today?<eos> Herr Eichorst in the afternoon.<eos> I know he's important to you, but I can't stand that man.<eos> I need him.<eos> Doesn't mean I like him.<eos> Have you noticed he smells funny?<eos> - Like rotten fish?
Your mother is dead.<eos> That creature took over her body.<eos> Her one goal is to turn you.<eos> - You don't know that. - Yes, I do!<eos> And after everything you've seen, so should you.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's that smell?<eos> Gunpowder.

How much does he want for it?<eos> Well, it is one of his most prized possessions.<eos> It's terrifically painful for him to part with...<eos> Skip the soft shoe and give me a number.<eos> Tell me what you're willing to pay.<eos> $200,000.<eos> I don't think that's going to get it done.<eos> Half a million.<eos> Well, you really want this book.<eos> In cash.

- As am I from you.<eos> - From me?<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, as absurd as it may sound, I had no idea how isolated I was.<eos> It's so reassuring to have someone to talk to.<eos> I know you never married.<eos> No... long-term relationships?<eos> No short-term relationships.<eos> A man of your success,<eos> - your power?
Everything that He has been working for, it will all fall to pieces.<eos> You understand me?<eos> Yes, I think I do.<eos> You are demanding that the Master come here and release His own divine and invaluable essence just so you can continue fornicating with your secretary.<eos> I will pass along the message.<eos> But what the Master does... or does not do... is determined only by Him.<eos> And matters of the heart are not a high priority.<eos> - I need more suction.<eos> - Suction.<eos> - Attention with this.
Come on.<eos> Let's look around.<eos> - Fet.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> She was here.<eos> Shit.<eos> She could have been moved to another car.<eos> If you're gonna switch cars, you don't do it behind the National Guard Headquarters.<eos> It's right there.<eos> Right in front of our goddamn faces.
It's been special.<eos> It is special, Rudyard.<eos> Very special.<eos> In the right hands, it could save all of mankind.<eos> It's in the right hands now.<eos> Please, just tell me what you want for it.<eos> You're not the only person who wants to buy it.<eos> Maybe someone else will give me more.<eos> Who else have you spoken to?<eos> Eldritch Palmer?
They're the ones who saddled Germany with debts and ruined our economy.<eos> They're parasites and leeches.<eos> What?<eos> You're so blind.<eos> You can't see what's right in front of your face.<eos> What, Helga?<eos> I'm a Jew.<eos> Is that how you see me?<eos> Am I a parasite?<eos> - Or a leech?
I want your letter of resignation on my desk tomorrow morning, or I will instruct the DA to indict you.<eos> After everything she's done for the city?<eos> You ungrateful piece of...<eos> Here. Call the DA right now.<eos> Meanwhile, I'll take this to the City Council.<eos> Way ahead of you.<eos> I've already spoken with Bernstein and Morello.<eos> They both agree that you need to step down, and the rest of the council will follow their lead.<eos> Captain Kowalski, please remove the Mayor from the premises.<eos> With pleasure.
If you're accusing me of being human, I'm guilty as charged.<eos> Give me 24 hours, and I will beat Mr. Palmer's offer.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Both of you can meet here tomorrow, can bid it out.<eos> Man with the deepest pocket wins.<eos> And leave the timepiece.<eos> The last Patek 1563 went for 1.57 million.<eos> I'll credit this to your account.<eos> And the rest of the funds must be paid in gold.<eos> Gold?
If anybody can get a permit to get Zack out of the city, it's her.<eos> He'll be safer with his grandparents.<eos> But he'll miss you terribly.<eos> Have no doubt about that.<eos> - Have you found the Lumen?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Continue.<eos> Tomorrow the Lumen goes on sale to the highest bidder.<eos> I need the Ancients to back me.<eos> With gold.
"Thank you, my dear, but you must excuse me.<eos> "I have to make an exit," and he ran off.<eos> He said, "I have to make an exit"?<eos> Well, of course, I followed him, fearing the worst.<eos> I didn't know he could run so fast.<eos> I just followed this trail of discarded clothing, the jacket, the waistcoat, and I thought, "We can't have Sir doing a striptease round town."<eos> But then I found him.<eos> Leaning up against a lamppost.<eos> Weeping. Where?<eos> Outside the Kardomah.
I can feel the power.<eos> And the mystery.<eos> In days gone by, this would have been a place where the High Priests robed.<eos> A kindred spirit.<eos> Lock the door.<eos> Come nearer.<eos> It's Irene.<eos> Irene.<eos> You want to act? Yes.<eos> Passionately?
Oh! World star, bitches.<eos> How's life in the real world, Spence?<eos> You still dreaming about laying people out?<eos> Nah, let me tell you something, Dan.<eos> Right now my dreams are all about deals and dollars.<eos> It's hard to lay people out when you're aiming for their kneecaps.<eos> Is that your professional opinion, Reggie?<eos> Well, hell, you never saw the Buffalo game.<eos> - What was that, 2000...<eos> - Eight.
I won't let you down, sir.<eos> Thanks, Doc.<eos> Feeling better every day.<eos> That is the general idea.<eos> - How's she doing?<eos> - Physically, she's fine.<eos> Getting out of that bay and facing the crew... that's another matter.<eos> Think I should talk to her?<eos> I don't think she wants to talk to anybody.<eos> - Not even you?
Only a matter of time till they strike again.<eos> Chang keeps them in line.<eos> Sooner or later, a beat dog bites.<eos> Heavenly Father.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for...<eos> I'm sorry, brothers, I know not what to say.<eos> Heavenly Father, bless this loathsome gruel we have set before us.<eos> Thank thee for this time with our beloved companions,<eos> Hunger, Want and Desolation.
Pau?<eos> La Rochelle.<eos> And my father?<eos> A noble?<eos> A very good man.<eos> An architect, crushed by the King.<eos> Why would the King crush my father?<eos> Because of who he was.<eos> What?<eos> A criminal?

Oh, what do you do the rest of the time?<eos> Take care of my family.<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You look exhausted.<eos> I pulled an all-nighter for work.<eos> Did Mikhail ever confide in you or ask you to keep anything secret?<eos> No, just his real name.<eos> He never introduced you to any colleagues or friends?<eos> No one?
To protect my cover so I didn't end up with a bullet - to the back of my head, yes.<eos> - How many times?<eos> That operation is compartmented, and I'm not supposed to talk about it to anyone, not even my old supervisory agent who hasn't been completely read into it.<eos> No. Lucky for us, I have been.<eos> So let's talk about how many times you used cocaine.<eos> I didn't lie about my handicap.<eos> I was just having an off day.<eos> Let me hook you up to one of your machines. We'll find out for sure.<eos> What's the story with Mr. Twitchy?<eos> Who?

All the equipment you'll need<eos> Is on an air america cargo plane<eos> That is waiting for you as we speak.<eos> Uh, mother, it sounded like you said, "cargo plane,"<eos> When obviously you meant,<eos> "first class luxury commercial airliner."<eos> Sterling, a commercial airline<eos> Won't let you parachute into the jungle<eos> In the middle of a communist insurgency-- a what?<eos> ...At night.
I think you guys actually did that.<eos> Anyway, I need to go get one out of a plane<eos> That crashed near here, so...<eos> Yes, I know where this airplane is.<eos> Duh. Me, too.<eos> So, if I just kinda leave, are you gonna be cool,<eos> Or try to sneak up on me and slit my throat?<eos> [sighs] well, I hope you're happy...<eos> Because I feel like a total dick.<eos> And also kinda racist.
- Huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Gentlemen, the door is open.<eos> PJ.<eos> Michelle... why don't you show Michelle your office?<eos> - Yeah, Michelle, PJ.<eos> - Hey, PJ.<eos> - Where's your office?<eos> - Uh, it's in the corner.<eos> The corner one.
Tomorrow they're gonna be nerds in a cubicle.<eos> Right now they're kings.<eos> Miguel, what up?<eos> It's Daryll Donovan.<eos> Hey, listen, I need another ten grand re-up at that party in Venice.<eos> Bunchy, a little help here.<eos> I'm lost.<eos> All right, look, you got to get your form down first.<eos> Good stance, go single.<eos> One hand at a time.
What the fuck were you thinking?<eos> - What?<eos> - You guys.<eos> Man, you guys are a bunch of rock stars.<eos> I just... I love your faces, both of you.<eos> You with your fucking snowy, white hair and you with your thin, little mustache.<eos> You're like a charming lesbian couple.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, you guys ran up another 10 on top of the 15.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
How do you expect me to have a relationship with you under the circumstances?<eos> Norman never has to know I'm here.<eos> A dead girl was found floating in the tidal flats early this morning.<eos> I'm wondering if you're missing anyone from, uh, your little party.<eos> Oh, Emma, this is Annika, room 4.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Have you seen the girl in number 4 today?<eos> I saw her car here.<eos> When is the last time you saw her?<eos> Last night.
I realize that she has been shot, so I call 911, and she dies before they arrive.<eos> I know, it's crazy.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> You've never seen that car before?<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> You towed the car.<eos> I don't know what that car was.<eos> Can I possibly get out of these clothes?<eos> What was wrong with Norman when he came down to the motel?<eos> Wrong with him?
You can't sit down with your lawyer and your business manager?<eos> I can't ask your father to come on Friday.<eos> Okay, fine, forget it.<eos> Go to your reunion.<eos> - I would if...<eos> - Show off your new crazy hair.<eos> I don't know where he is!<eos> What?<eos> The last I heard, he was in Tulsa with his former student.<eos> Ina.
Truth is, it's probably the best thing that could've happened.<eos> This morning I didn't have a leg to stand on in court.<eos> Now...<eos> DWI plus the weed?<eos> I wanted to go for full custody,<eos> I bet you I'd have a chance.<eos> F-full custody?<eos> The four kids?<eos> Yes.<eos> With you?
He went to the bathroom.<eos> He's sleeping.<eos> God, I miss you.<eos> Downstairs? Where?<eos> What's gonna happen to us?<eos> There's no denying it, Your Honor, my client is a public figure.<eos> And out here on the island in Suffolk County?<eos> Forget it.<eos> Fascination with Noah Solloway...<eos> His life, his private life, his work...
You know perfectly well that I did.<eos> I want the whole story.<eos> Tell me the story.<eos> The story?<eos> Yes, you're a writer, aren't you?<eos> I want all the details.<eos> How did the two of you meet?<eos> Uh, well...<eos> - Uh... - We met in Montauk.<eos> Last summer.
Yeah, I do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's, uh...<eos> That's the worst thing in the world, kid.<eos> And your Noah, he knows all this?<eos> Uh... some of it.<eos> What you got there?<eos> Oh, uh... it's Gabriel's stone.<eos> He was a worrier.<eos> A really sensitive kid.
Good day, Mr. Strobridge.<eos> Yeah.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> "By three methods we may learn wisdom.<eos> First, by reflection, second, by imitation..."
Noble little engine, the first locomotive to run on California soil.<eos> Christened by Ted Judah and his wife, 1855.<eos> I was gonna put it in my museum one day.<eos> This here will have to do.<eos> Let's get it done, son.<eos> It ain't so bad, is it?<eos> Tell me it ain't so bad!<eos> Can... can you wiggle your toes?<eos> No?<eos> This one.
This is how you show us the respect we ask for?<eos> Nothing a man respects more than an empty stomach.<eos> This won't get the men back to work.<eos> Will if they want to eat.<eos> Shake hands.<eos> Last I saw, those two fools were trying to kill each other.<eos> Paddy's been spending time with a whore Dutch fancies.<eos> - They're due for a chat. - Huh?<eos> You know these men backwards and forwards, McGinnes.<eos> Aye, sober and drunk.
Each year I throw a celebration because my men, though far from home, long for China and its traditions.<eos> A shopping expedition to San Francisco seems a small price to pay to bring it to them.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> I think San Francisco's a long way to go for fireworks, Mr. Chang.<eos> I never was much for tradition.<eos> Such a western notion that the past does not matter.<eos> That the past can be forgotten.<eos> What's your business with Thor Gundersen?<eos> I didn't realize you made it your business to keep an eye on my customers.<eos> Just the bloodthirsty crazy ones.
Ma'am.<eos> What, my good woman, was that about?<eos> What do you think?<eos> My hotel is empty!<eos> My property in Cheyenne, worthless!<eos> Your lies and your schemes are about to send me to the poor house!<eos> Trust me, I have your best interests at heart.<eos> That would require you having one!<eos> Maggie, at least let me try to explain.<eos> Over dinner, this evening.
All right, boys, how about I measure you firm.<eos> Biggest and smallest get a free poke with the girl of their choosing.<eos> All right, what have we got here?<eos> Will you come see?<eos> - Nice celebration. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> You know, back in Taishan, I dreamed of the day my wife would give me a son.<eos> Three girls later...<eos> I always say daughters is a blessing.<eos> Mei Fong was a blessing.<eos> A special blessing.
Take me to the rest of 'em.<eos> On Heavenly Father's name, I do not know...<eos> Mm. She pulls to the left.<eos> You don't want to test your luck again, you best get to walking'.<eos> And... Yeah?<eos> You're missing the show, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> - Show me what's in them rice crates. - Hmm?<eos> Open 'em.<eos> Slow.<eos> Steady now.
Heavenly Father is telling you to slaughter the sheep so that you may wear his wool.<eos> He's calling upon you to cut the unholy sheep's throat!<eos> You're afraid.<eos> I see it, my son.<eos> But fear not, this holy divination has been bestowed by Heavenly Father above upon you, and you alone.<eos> Yes.<eos> My mission is clear.<eos> Yes, my son.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> The railroad?
You do know.<eos> I'm relieved he's not involved.<eos> Yeah, well, unfortunately that doesn't help Nick any.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I couldn't help but overhear your conversation.<eos> I may be able to help.<eos> Well, the doctor said there was nothing he could do.<eos> I know what you're looking for, but it's expensive.<eos> How expensive?<eos> $10,000 cash.
This was where i cut my teeth.<eos> I was in my early 20s, Miscavige was in his early 20s.<eos> We were taking over for this group that had created the largest domestic espionage operation in the history of the United States.<eos> They were breaking into offices, framing people.<eos> This is the activities of a church?<eos> There was a guy who, uh, you know, was a reporter for "the LA times," whose dog was poisoned while he was working on a scientology story.<eos> Again and again while reporting the story, we met many former members who describe scientology as a dangerous and deeply paranoid organization.<eos> They hired private detectives to harass people.<eos> I have been sued twice.<eos> Financial ruin.
Peter? !<eos> Your sandwiches.<eos> Laura Hawkins.<eos> 'Mrs Hawkins, it is Miss Evans here.<eos> Matilda's head of year.'<eos> ~ What's she done?<eos> ~ 'I think you should come in.'<eos> What upsets me most is how brilliant your grades have always been.<eos> The careers advisor said she'd make a brilliant research assistant.<eos> Or trainee sonographer.
- All I want is a home.<eos> - He meant for us to find this, Maxie.<eos> We need Fred and Mia.<eos> Where do we start?<eos> No, you don't, you're wanted for murder, you have to lay low.<eos> - I will not hide again. - Well, if you want this to work, you'll have to, because the people hunting us know your face now.<eos> 53 Park Drive, NW6.<eos> You'll be safe there until I find the others.<eos> You've put me with a human?<eos> This human, yes.
And she freaked out, screamed, and her face, it was like... human.<eos> - Scared.<eos> - And what exactly<eos> - did he do? - Nothing fancy, he just accessed her root system directly with a cloned file key.<eos> Right, might as well try that first.<eos> So, are you a headcracker?<eos> Me?<eos> No aspiring.<eos> What kind of Synth was she before?<eos> A very special one.
Mm.<eos> Tobe.<eos> Oh, hear me out.<eos> Look, I was a idiot.<eos> I shouldn't have done it.<eos> It was a horrible, stupid mistake.<eos> But it's just between me and your mum, all right?<eos> No, it's not!<eos> How you could you do that to Mum?<eos> To us, to Anita?
Tobe.<eos> Oh, hear me out.<eos> Look, I was a idiot.<eos> I shouldn't have done it.<eos> It was a horrible, stupid mistake.<eos> But it's just between me and your mum, all right?<eos> No, it's not!<eos> How you could you do that to Mum?<eos> To us, to Anita?<eos> To Anita?
Right, I've found the memories.<eos> I'll email Mum some stills.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Slow down -- and if you go online,<eos> - Hobb will be able to track you.<eos> - You don't know my sister.<eos> I'm shielding us in about five different ways and using a darknet email account. We're untraceable.<eos> That's all right, then.<eos> You said you spoke to one of them.<eos> Which one?
I wanna keep it that way.<eos> I'm sorry, Jade.<eos> I can't let Ryder die.<eos> Just please help.<eos> Now, that sounds like two visitors.<eos> One is Sunny for sure and the other is somebody... small.<eos> Waldo, meet M.K.<eos> I was Waldo's Colt.<eos> You were a Clipper?<eos> Regent.
What happened?<eos> Well, let's just say I don't get around much anymore.<eos> M.K. here seems to think training is only about fighting.<eos> I was hoping you'd help me out with him.<eos> Aw, Sunshine, you sure know how to make an old man feel young.<eos> I'd be real pleased to pitch in, except, well, this runt is just too damn small.<eos> He's never gonna make it.<eos> You wanted to fight.<eos> Now you fight.<eos> Him?
Just wait here for me and M.K. to get back.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to get back to the fort.<eos> Jade's been poisoned, the baron's expecting me.<eos> If you go in there, I'm not sure I can get you out.<eos> Just stay here.<eos> Sunny.<eos> Did you kill my parents?<eos> Quinn did it. I told you.<eos> With your sword?
What have you done?<eos> I've set things in motion to make this world safer, not only for my children, but for yours.<eos> Just know you'll always have a place here.<eos> Tilda, take the good doctor home.<eos> Where's Sunny?<eos> Alive.<eos> Are you gonna kill him?<eos> Well, that's up to you, M.K.<eos> I believe you have the potential to be a great Clipper.<eos> Even greater than Sunny.
Ab... About everything.<eos> Well, it's not like you're the one who ran me off the road.<eos> Wait, wait...<eos> Someone ran you off the road?<eos> Yes, and threatened me.<eos> Some guy who told me to contact some other guy because I had something of his.<eos> What's wrong with these criminals that they can't just hang on to their own shit?<eos> Like it's my fault!<eos> Who did he tell you to contact?<eos> Bob Paris.
I can't help it.<eos> I'm just, ah, built that way.<eos> Took care of both my parents... emotionally.<eos> I was raised to study every breath, every gesture.<eos> It's a survival skill.<eos> I survived.<eos> I never met anyone like you.<eos> Someone who just talks about things so openly.<eos> Maybe you could actually help me with some things that I'm going through.<eos> Difficult things.
Thank you so much.<eos> Come on, Norman, let's go.<eos> Oh, yes, Mother.<eos> Here I come.<eos> Following after you in a very masculine and attractive way.<eos> Holy crap, Dylan left, like, a hundred messages.<eos> Oh, my Lord.<eos> What was going on with you two?<eos> Jeez, all I did was leave for a few hours.<eos> With a suitcase.
Probably.<eos> - Smells great.<eos> - Chicken Marsala.<eos> Be ready in about half hour.<eos> I thought we could eat dinner here tonight, and make it special.<eos> Oh, I, um... I didn't know that you were making dinner.<eos> Uh, I... I have plans to meet with Emma.<eos> Why are you having dinner with Emma?<eos> Well, she, uh, she stayed over here the night that you were gone to help with Norman, and I just... I... I wanted to take her to dinner.<eos> Norman, yeah.
It's all... It's Christmastime.<eos> I got watches, I got scarves, got hats. Andre... no, no.<eos> Whoa, whoa. Dre, come here.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Oh, what's going on? JAMAL:<eos> What's wrong with him? ANDRE: I love you, Dad.<eos> That's why I came. What are you smoking?<eos> Smoking nothing.<eos> Smoking happiness.<eos> Merry Christmas.
Congratulations, Ms. Cookie Lyon, you are now the head of AR for Empire Records.<eos> What are you talking about, Lucious?<eos> That's what you wanted.<eos> Position's open.<eos> Well, whatever Cookie wants, Cookie gets.<eos> I want you to be a better father.<eos> I want you to think about what our sons need instead of being so self-serving all the time.<eos> And...<eos> I want to produce your tribute concert.<eos> But under my own banner.
But you know what is?<eos> This might be against hospital rules.<eos> Pray with me.<eos> I don't pray.<eos> Why won't you just give it a try? What have you got to lose?<eos> Why don't you pray for me?<eos> Dear God...<eos> So, Reg, how do you know Vernon?<eos> We just met.<eos> And Olivia?
Why don't you pray for me?<eos> Dear God...<eos> So, Reg, how do you know Vernon?<eos> We just met.<eos> And Olivia?<eos> We go way back.<eos> Dad, you seen Camilla?<eos> I can't find her nowhere.<eos> Well, stop looking for her-- she's gone. She left with Malcolm.<eos> With Malcolm?
And while Koto is gone, you two are riding together.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Cool.<eos> So, if I'm with her, who's got, uh, Molky?<eos> Junior McCormack.<eos> - My brother? - Uh-huh.<eos> He's sitting at my desk.<eos> Hil-billy.<eos> Where's he gonna sit?<eos> - My desk.
[chuckling] Hey, baby.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> How's it going?<eos> All right.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Share the wealth?<eos> I just happen to have another glass right here.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Cheers.
All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Oh, that's nice.<eos> Yeah, gift from upstairs.<eos> It pays to get shot, I guess, huh?<eos> [chuckling] I heard that.<eos> So, what's your take on Kaleb's murder?<eos> Off the record.
All right.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Oh, that's nice.<eos> Yeah, gift from upstairs.<eos> It pays to get shot, I guess, huh?<eos> [chuckling] I heard that.<eos> So, what's your take on Kaleb's murder?<eos> Off the record.<eos> Off the record?
[door slams] [knock on door] Hey, Commander.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Have a seat and close the door.<eos> [door closes] Word is the Nortenos and Surenos are creeping back into Ingleside.<eos> Now, Field Operations has set up a task force to work with the community, coordinate with Youth Services Unit.<eos> I'm reassigning you.<eos> [scoffs] You're kidding me, right?<eos> I know the time you put in with Potrero...<eos> Yeah, a year.<eos> Me and my crew.
It worried me. I... I didn't want him to get hurt.<eos> "Hurt." Physically?<eos> Emotionally?<eos> Emotionally...<eos> Alfie wanted friends, but he always had a hard time getting kids to stick around.<eos> And I... I thought this would end the same way.<eos> But it didn't.<eos> Well, what do you think made Mr. Maker different?<eos> I think he wanted to get something out of my son.<eos> Like what?
In a week, just in case.<eos> He remembers everything.<eos> Everything from his whole life.<eos> And?<eos> That night Alex mentioned when you said you were at the hospital, but it was actually flooded, do you remember where you really were?<eos> No idea.<eos> Why?<eos> I was just thinking about it earlier today.<eos> That night.<eos> The night of the storm.
Drive across the Williamsburg Bridge.<eos> Park on 11th.<eos> We could be driving into a trap.<eos> If he wanted us dead, he'd have put a bomb in the car, not a cell phone.<eos> I don't think he wants to kill us or anyone.<eos> So what does he want then?<eos> I think he wants to defect.<eos> He's with two federal agents.<eos> How are they going to grab him?<eos> Carefully.
How are they going to grab him?<eos> Carefully.<eos> _ Use force against U.S. federal agents in their own country?<eos> This is a line Moscow has never crossed.<eos> I don't think you understand the stakes, Victor.<eos> I do.<eos> If it goes wrong, if they end up dead, that's the kind of thing that could restart the cold war.<eos> If the Americans get their hands on the files Mikhail stole, it will start an actual war.<eos> We need Vasso.<eos> At any cost.
FBI!<eos> Search warrant!<eos> They knew we were coming.<eos> And they have Kylie.<eos> What do you got for us today, Sarge?<eos> You're on light duty until you heal from your shooting.<eos> My personal and my city doctors cleared me.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> But your sergeant says you're not, so behind the desk until I say.<eos> What desk?
- Thank you.<eos> - Going to the studio?<eos> Yeah, apparently Richard Sherman challenged Money Mayweather to a bare-knuckle brawl in Vegas last night.<eos> Shit. It's already 8:30.<eos> You have a busy day?<eos> I've got to lock down Vernon's Dallas contract today.<eos> Isn't that sort of a Jason thing?<eos> It is, but let's just say I've got a lot riding on this deal closing.<eos> Okay, well, if you can spare the time, there's someone I would like you to meet for me.<eos> Who?
Doesn't matter. Why don't you do us both a favor and stay away from Vernon and Ricky just for the day? Maybe they won't fire us.<eos> Get your shit together, Joe.<eos> Yeah. Bye-bye.<eos> I haven't seen a nautical cleanup effort like this since the Exxon Valdez.<eos> Ha, funny.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Daddy needs a little hair of the dog.<eos> Sorry, pal, party's over.<eos> Mr. Anderson requested his boat for the afternoon, so you and your friends are gonna have to leave.<eos> What friends?
I'd love to, but the board doesn't know what we know and it might be a hard sell to them with the whole time travel doubles thing, you know.<eos> Paradoxically speaking.<eos> Why don't you tell us about these soldiers from Brad's future?<eos> I'm sorry, your future.<eos> Sorry, come again?<eos> In English, please?<eos> Power suits, heavy weapons, warlord Kellogg future scenario?<eos> Brad spelled it out for us.<eos> Maybe he's the one you should be talking to.<eos> Your boyfriend.
I just feel like we've been down this road before.<eos> It's Liber8 all over again.<eos> Well, this time we know they're working for Kellogg and we've got a man on the inside.<eos> If that's the case, why don't we have anybody in custody yet?<eos> Maybe Brad will reach out.<eos> We can't count on "maybe".<eos> You know, ever since you got knocked out there's been, I don't know, something different.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I've been preoccupied.<eos> Thoughts of 2077.
You could say that.<eos> I'm enjoying this.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You want me to deal with Kellogg's soldiers.<eos> That means I need soldiers of my own.<eos> Travis is our best weapon in this fight, you and I both know it.<eos> No.<eos> In case you haven't noticed, we are in a police department, ok?<eos> There's an entire force on call to help bring down the bad guys.<eos> Not bad guys like this.
I needed to talk to you.<eos> You're mad at me.<eos> There's no guide to parenting kids that are twice your age.<eos> I was upset, I didn't mean to take it out on you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That did a lot of things.<eos> I learned to let it go.<eos> Water. Duck's back.<eos> He was hard on you.<eos> On everyone.
You're mad at me.<eos> There's no guide to parenting kids that are twice your age.<eos> I was upset, I didn't mean to take it out on you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That did a lot of things.<eos> I learned to let it go.<eos> Water. Duck's back.<eos> He was hard on you.<eos> On everyone.<eos> Your mother?
Yeah, what about them?<eos> Well, if they rigged them all up together They could use them as a transducer.<eos> Look.<eos> How did I miss that?<eos> Distracted?<eos> I'm running some new algorithms right now.<eos> There.<eos> These should be up in a minute or so.<eos> So what happened after I left?<eos> With my mother?
I'm the embodiment of what Liber8 was fighting for.<eos> Choice.<eos> Self-determination.<eos> Freedom.<eos> Who better represents those virtues than me?<eos> It's what you do with those virtues.<eos> Sonya.<eos> Lucas.<eos> Jowarski.<eos> Kagame.
No, he's meeting me at the park.<eos> No, he's right here.<eos> They're coming for Kellogg.<eos> Alec, listen to me.<eos> Tell Carlos and get the hell out of there.<eos> Brad's here.<eos> I don't think it's a friendly visit.<eos> Check the cameras.<eos> He's blacked them out.<eos> Some device.
I'm so happy to see you again.<eos> She's happy to see you.<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Anything wrong.<eos> I'm the one who always did the things wrong.<eos> Nobody did anything wrong.<eos> We're all happy and we're together.<eos> When you lived with your grandmother as long as I did...<eos> No, your grandmother...
Is her apartment missing a rug?<eos> Hardwood floor is no way to know. [Sighs]<eos> If it was easy, anybody could do it.<eos> - Holiday.<eos> - Rizzoli.<eos> Sounds like something your mom would serve for dinner.<eos> "Kids, come to the table.<eos> The holiday Rizzoli is ready."<eos> - You don't know many Italians, do you?<eos> - Just you guys.
It doesn't make any sense.<eos> It also doesn't make sense that he was leading the tournament.<eos> The emergency contact on his phone was his wife, Carla.<eos> - I'll give her a call.<eos> - Korsak: Jane?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> This is Skeet Martin.<eos> He was fishing in the competition.<eos> He wants to talk to you.<eos> Only you.
- I got that.<eos> Look, I-I was upset that I wouldn't be able to fish.<eos> But I didn't know when it would start again or if it would.<eos> Anyway, there ... there was no way I could win, so I-I left.<eos> You finished second to Mark Harris three times.<eos> First place was $100,000.<eos> Second place was $5,000.<eos> - It had to make you angry.<eos> - I don't play for second.<eos> - Especially not to Mark Harris.
Mark Harris did.<eos> How many years have you been a fisherman?<eos> [Sighs] My whole life.<eos> And that number will remain private, if you don't mind.<eos> Ever cheated? [Chuckles]<eos> Look, sometimes the rules change.<eos> It takes a while to catch up.<eos> I don't know what Mark Harris did.<eos> But, if I was you, I would talk to his girlfriend, Linda.<eos> - Ex-girlfriend.
Is that a trick?<eos> Nope.<eos> Vanilla cake. Vanilla frost.<eos> Hmm. They look great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I found a bag of flour at the station... well I couldn't resist.<eos> You're done. [Chuckles]<eos> Francesco the third, come to papa.<eos> Frankie!<eos> With the paper and all?
Yes, thank you.<eos> I need you to pull Bonnie Leonard's letter of resignation off my desk and read it to me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> "Dear Mr. Phillips, I regret to inform you that I am resigning from my position as office assistant for healthful foods distribution effective immediately.<eos> Thank you for the support and the amazing opportunities you've provided me ..."<eos> "During my tenure.<eos> I have enjoyed my time with the company so much, - but I've decided to leave Boston."<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Because Bonnie and Sarah's letter were both written by the same person.<eos> Our killer.
- Not helping.<eos> - No.<eos> It's my personal life,<eos> - and I don't want any interference.<eos> - Ma, that is ridiculous.<eos> Why would I want to interfere with you and...<eos> Morty?<eos> Wrong.<eos> Robert?<eos> - James.
- Of course. Yeah.<eos> That's what makes this such a shock.<eos> I've known Kirk for years, and I never, ever would've thought that he'd be capable of doing something like this.<eos> - Except that ...<eos> - Well, he may have murdered three people.<eos> You need to tell us whatever you know.<eos> Ainsley was a good soldier.<eos> But he came back from Iraq... changed.<eos> Honestly, I've been worried about his mental health<eos> - for a while now.
Kent?<eos> I think this is yours.<eos> Ah. I was wondering where that got to.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, I'll see you shortly.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> We all know that Susie loved a party. [laughter]<eos> I knew the moment that I met Susie that she was someone very special.<eos> The second week she was at the lab, we had a corpse arrive...<eos> 700 bee stings.
What are you doing here?<eos> Well, Maura had said that you called, so I came to say goodbye.<eos> - Wonderful.<eos> May I? - Please.<eos> - Food good here?<eos> - Oh, cut the crap, Carlo.<eos> Look, you may have gotten away with suing the funeral parlor at Aunt Josie's funeral and mysteriously cutting your fingertip off with a ladder at Kay's Hardware, but you and I both know your neck is fine.<eos> All right?<eos> Really?<eos> With the cervical collar?
No, that sounds terrible.<eos> - No, I'm here.<eos> - We'll be right there. - Mm-hmm.<eos> 6x09 - "Love Taps"<eos> So don't make it a dinner with your father.<eos> - Do something casual.<eos> - My father and I don't do casual.<eos> Well, maybe you should start.<eos> You know, just meet, talk.<eos> Baby steps.
- Over the summer.<eos> - You and your brother were close?<eos> Stuart was the man of the family.<eos> He was the youngest, but he always knew what to say to make us feel better.<eos> Do you know if he had any issues at school?<eos> No.<eos> Being broke would probably be his biggest problem.<eos> He was paying his own way through college.<eos> That's why he started working for that, um...<eos> - computer boyfriend thing.
She kept talking about this wedding she was looking forward to going to, and she didn't invite me.<eos> - Did you offer to take her?<eos> - No!<eos> Obviously, she didn't want me there.<eos> And I got annoyed and said some things I wish I hadn't.<eos> Oh, so you got your feelings hurt?<eos> - Just tell her.<eos> - I will.<eos> Maybe over a really nice bottle of wine.<eos> Uh... or over a burger and fries.
I mean, except for Angela, and that was just because we were here.<eos> Of course I want you to meet my friends, and they are dying to meet you.<eos> Oh, that's nice.<eos> Maybe I'll throw a little get-together tomorrow night.<eos> - Oh, no, you don't have to do that.<eos> - Oh, I want to... very much.<eos> Accept my apology?<eos> - You want a burger?<eos> - I'd love one.<eos> Hey, you free tomorrow night?
You know, when your kids are little, they look up to you.<eos> You're their whole world.<eos> But, uh, parents are not perfect.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> I'm not excusing what your father did.<eos> He made a mistake, and one that has caused you so much... pain and... anger.<eos> - Why hold on to that, Maura?<eos> - At this point, I'm not certain I know how to let it go.<eos> Well, you've lived with it for so long. maybe you should try something different and see what happens.<eos> Baby steps.
While it is true... that Raya had motive to kill this Ten Mohs,<eos> - he didn't do it.<eos> - How can you be so sure?<eos> Well, other than the sightseeing trip he took an hour ago, he's been with me since his arrival in Boston.<eos> - I'd have noticed something.<eos> - All the same, I'd like you to give us a call when he comes back.<eos> It's very nice to meet you, Dr. Isles.<eos> Even under the circumstances, thank you kindly.<eos> You are not gonna believe who I just ran into.<eos> - Tommy.
- All the same, I'd like you to give us a call when he comes back.<eos> It's very nice to meet you, Dr. Isles.<eos> Even under the circumstances, thank you kindly.<eos> You are not gonna believe who I just ran into.<eos> - Tommy.<eos> - No.<eos> - The family that adopted Jo Friday.<eos> - No.<eos> - The chef that's building out the restaurant down the street. - Mnh-mnh.<eos> - Tasha.
Of course.<eos> - Did you need something?<eos> - My wife, uh... has told me about how important you are to Maura, how much she relies on your counsel.<eos> If you knew who I was, why did you pretend that you didn't?<eos> It... um, seemed easier.<eos> Somehow.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, I... muffed that one.<eos> But I was wondering... could you put in a good word for me?<eos> - With Maura? - Mm-hmm.
Who fakes their death?<eos> That's crazy, right?<eos> I mean, even in Roger's world.<eos> What do you mean, "in Roger's world"?<eos> Fast life.<eos> The Hollywood scene, you know?<eos> Then his girlfriend O.D.'ed, and suicide made sense... even if they never found a body.<eos> Do you think maybe there was a part of this fast life that made him fake his death?<eos> Well, he was obviously in too deep at the hotel, so maybe he thought it was the only way out.<eos> - What hotel?
- Lianne said she was working for him.<eos> - You didn't believe her?<eos> She wouldn't tell me what she was doing for the money.<eos> She wouldn't even tell me his name.<eos> Did she tell you what he did or how he looked or where he lived? - No.<eos> - Not a curious guy, are you?<eos> Doesn't matter, all the details.<eos> She was gonna start using again.<eos> You know what you call an ex-junkie with cash?<eos> - A junkie.
Let me see what he's got, you crazy... son of a bitch!<eos> How long you been out here, Michael?<eos> About 20 years.<eos> Ina was done with the city.<eos> Well, the city's changed since we were kids.<eos> It keeps right on changing.<eos> All the money you got, and you never bought yourself a country house?<eos> I was terrified I'd leave the neighborhood for 15 minutes, the vultures would snatch it away from me.<eos> - I never even took a vacation.<eos> - Not even with Ruth?
We'll have two parties, a fun one down here with just us and then an awkward, uncomfortable one in the living room with Holt.<eos> He doesn't even have to know about it.<eos> Separate parties, separate but equal... forget I said that phrase.<eos> Ok, we don't have much time.<eos> Captain's in the bathroom, and we all know how efficient he is in there.<eos> Here's the plan:<eos> The boring Holt party will be in the living room.<eos> At least three of us must be with him in that room at all times.<eos> It's not a party if there aren't four people.<eos> Especially between the sheets.
What do you mean by that?<eos> Nothing, darling.<eos> You know you're not the easiest toke.<eos> But that's why we love you.<eos> Everyone thought Vi was such an angel.<eos> She was the one with the temper.<eos> I remember.<eos> - So, what's the O stand for?<eos> - Well, O is a big letter for women.<eos> - Ovaries.
You don't even know who Mystique is.<eos> You're right.<eos> - What's a bonobo?<eos> - A very advanced ape.<eos> The females run the show, they masturbate all the time... and they don't have wars, unlike chimps and humans.<eos> So you think women are better than men?<eos> - Men are okay.<eos> My father was a man.<eos> - Mine was a sperm.<eos> Donor.
Okay, but you confiscated my credit card, which was totally unfair.<eos> It cost me $2000 to have the garage door fixed.<eos> Brake.<eos> Gas.<eos> Brake.<eos> Gas.<eos> So I'm assuming that you then went to her for money... but she doesn't have any money either so, of course, you came to me.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Well, you missed a few steps in between, but you're right.<eos> - What about all those condoms?
Brake.<eos> Gas.<eos> Brake.<eos> Gas.<eos> So I'm assuming that you then went to her for money... but she doesn't have any money either so, of course, you came to me.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Well, you missed a few steps in between, but you're right.<eos> - What about all those condoms?<eos> - We used them.<eos> - Oh, you and the rodent?
- I am not yelling!<eos> Did I yell? No!<eos> Jesus, come on, move it, you moron. Move it!<eos> - Am I gonna go to hell?<eos> - What?<eos> - Am I gonna go to hell?<eos> What if it's true?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Along with all the millions of other women who've had abortions?<eos> - Yeah. Along with them.
Even after the police gave up, he still continued.<eos> Kaede!<eos> Say, is that your boyfriend?<eos> He's not!<eos> Then who's he?<eos> Which school is he from?<eos> Go away!<eos> Sorry.<eos> I wonder if I can also live an ordinary life now.<eos> Ordinary?
John: Let's see if we can find those camping lanterns.<eos> Let's hope they work.<eos> Hey, dad?<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> It's kind of a guy question.<eos> Sure.<eos> So, how is Emmett handling all this?<eos> Um, I'm not sure.<eos> He, uh, sort of concocted this story in his head where he makes everything that happened Tank's fault, which is not entirely wrong, but it's also not, uh...<eos> Entirely the truth.
I couldn't get her to a game to save my life.<eos> Well, you know, if you guys had won the pennant like the Royals did last year, I might have come.<eos> - That's nice.<eos> - Enough about baseball.<eos> Are you sure there isn't anything I can do to help?<eos> Yeah, you can open up that bottle of Pinot we brought.<eos> Okay? Let's get this party started.<eos> Lucille: Yeah, come on.<eos> Lucille introduced me to that when we were in...<eos> Napa last summer.
_<eos> Well, don't post that anywhere.<eos> With my luck, I'll probably get a probation violation.<eos> Thank you for visiting Bay.<eos> It's great to have you home.<eos> She really missed you.<eos> You done?<eos> So what did we say?<eos> $75? Let me get my checkbook.<eos> Cash only.
He and his business partner there started this interesting little swap meet attracting "murderabilia" buffs from across the region.<eos> Murderabilia.<eos> True crime collectibles.<eos> Artwork, autographs, mementos.<eos> All from famous killers.<eos> Where'd they get all this crap?<eos> Some of it comes from police property auctions, others are gifts from incarcerated killers.<eos> As long as the convicts aren't directly profiting, it's legal to sell this stuff.<eos> Including the car belonging to Lucas Reem.<eos> With our fresh kill here, Damon Harlow.
I heard about him online, what he did for a living.<eos> "Murderabilia."<eos> I sent him this awful e-mail, telling him he should be ashamed of himself, if not locked up.<eos> And then he took me to coffee.<eos> And he told me everything that he'd studied about Lucas Reem and other serials.<eos> The history, the psychology.<eos> Damon was a student, exploring the darkest parts of humanity.<eos> Selling off some artifacts helped him support his studies.<eos> When exactly were you in the car at the convention site?<eos> Yesterday morning.
I can't!<eos> I can't... Turn into a dragon anymore.<eos> I lost the fire a long time ago.<eos> Then let's get that fire back.<eos> Sorry we couldn't stay to clean.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> You need the beauty sleep more than I do.<eos> It's good to see you again, Regina.<eos> Hope you had fun last night.<eos> Last night?

- now!<eos> - Now!<eos> Actually, where's Schmidt?<eos> Well, it's with a heavy heart... :<eos> Oh! that we really must leave you.<eos> We really must.<eos> He's too much.<eos> It was a pleasure.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> Easy on the puns, okay?
Where is it?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, it's an e-mail from Wellington Prep.<eos> You do realize we were just about to have sex, right?<eos> Say something to get back in the mood... say raccoon.<eos> They're offering me the job of headmaster.<eos> In England?<eos> Raccoon?<eos> - So, you'd be the headmaster?<eos> - Headmaster.

Previously on "Resurrection"...<eos> What exactly happened this morning?<eos> We were all asleep in our beds.<eos> The next minute, we were standing in front of a bar in Arcadia.<eos> Mass returns have typically been accompanied by a trigger.<eos> You're saying there's another on the way?<eos> Yes.<eos> A big one.<eos> Agent Bellamy seems to think you can offer our guests here some comfort.<eos> God willing.
The opera lover with the... velvet cool cape?<eos> Hold on.<eos> If Lauren's not cheating, then who's the cheater?<eos> I...<eos> I think personally... That Morgan is.<eos> Morgan?<eos> (Danny) Yep.<eos> That doesn't sound a lot like Morgan, does it?<eos> With whom?<eos> Dr. L.
Hold on.<eos> If Lauren's not cheating, then who's the cheater?<eos> I...<eos> I think personally... That Morgan is.<eos> Morgan?<eos> (Danny) Yep.<eos> That doesn't sound a lot like Morgan, does it?<eos> With whom?<eos> Dr. L.<eos> Mindy?
No, forget your horse.<eos> You'll be arrested before you've gone half a mile.<eos> You'll travel in my carriage...<eos> I will take you to Chambord.<eos> Your home in Condé is the first place they'll look for you.<eos> And if someone finds out we're traveling together,<eos> Chambord will be the next place they look.<eos> If only we could get you to your brother, the king of Navarre.<eos> But the roads along the border will be crawling<eos> - with Swiss guards.
You shouldn't stay just to be polite.<eos> My brother's parties have a tendency to become somewhat scandalous.<eos> Well, now I'm intrigued.<eos> This is awkward.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> A toast to our guest of honor.<eos> Queen Mary, you're radiant.<eos> Like Venus rising from the foam-flecked sea.<eos> And tonight...
May you have better fortune than France has offered you thus far.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been waiting and waiting.<eos> What have I missed?<eos> Well, for one, your sister Claude told me that you were lovers.<eos> Half sister, and it was years ago.<eos> We were very young, very drunk, and Claude managed to briefly convince me that Henry wasn't her father.<eos> Well, now I understand your insistence on the word "half."<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> A very brief mistake.
Come on.<eos> Yeah, like that.<eos> You're so beautiful like this.<eos> I can do this all night.<eos> No, no, no, no, you don't want to do that.<eos> Look,Dad,Idon 'twant to argue with you about this.<eos> I just want to go home. Back to Seattle.<eos> Hey, come on, we've talked about this before, honey.<eos> With everything that's going on--<eos> Gig Harbor all over again.
Dreams really do come true.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Where's my daughter?<eos> She's here.<eos> And you'll have her.<eos> Just as soon as you slide that gun over here.<eos> We wouldn't want any surprises, would we?<eos> I'm sure you can understand.<eos> My brother and I don't have a lot of trust in cops.<eos> Even dirty ones.
Scott, a good lab partner should be metaphysically empathetic.<eos> Tongs or spoons?<eos> - Uh... - Oh, my god!<eos> Well, I looked.<eos> I shouldn't have looked.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, bollocks.<eos> Receptacle.<eos> Hey. You all right there, Igor?<eos> Still with me?
You come inside, I tell you about it.<eos> Oh, sweetheart, there is nothing more that I would love.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Just getting to know the enemy, Major.<eos> You have an assignment.<eos> I will brief you so this time you don't stray.<eos> Sir.<eos> Dirty Paul.<eos> He lies with my sestras.<eos> Even Rachel.
Willard?<eos> Hello, Gracie.<eos> Mother.<eos> Your family cares for you, Gracie, even as you refuse to care for yourself.<eos> You've been crying.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Mark, he...<eos> He took advantage of you.<eos> Yes.<eos> And your stupidity.
Castor and LEDA.<eos> Two donors, two originals.<eos> Siblings!<eos> You are not my family.<eos> Now, I need to go find Gracie.<eos> Mark.<eos> Mark!<eos> Mrs. Johanssen, please.<eos> We shared everything with you, Mark.<eos> Our home, our hearts, our daughter.
What did you expect, cheesecake?<eos> He was suffering.<eos> And now you are.<eos> Oh, Helena.<eos> Guilty pleasures won't help you escape.<eos> Poor little brother.<eos> Never even saw the sunlight.<eos> No.<eos> His DNA doesn't have the synthetic sequences that made you and your brothers viable.<eos> Viable but defective.
Okay.<eos> But you have to help me.<eos> Hey.<eos> You never told us John Sadler was killed.<eos> You were eavesdropping.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wasn't about to leave you alone with Rosemary's baby, was I?<eos> Come on, S.<eos> He was a beautiful rebel.<eos> Also a fairly beautiful drunk.
Sarah, I think you are institutionalized too.<eos> Sorry I ever said that.<eos> Okay, ready?<eos> Hide, hide, hide.<eos> Okay, good, good.<eos> Good girl, good girl.<eos> All that hand-wringing, Felix.<eos> She's just a normal girl.<eos> Yes.<eos> Careful with the gloating.
Castor and Leda.<eos> I've been feeling this for a while.<eos> It's not just two factions, is it?<eos> Who's in charge, David?<eos> Keep your boys alive, Doctor, and we can all get what we want.<eos> You satisfied?<eos> Yes. In fact, it's the... the best manicure I've ever had.<eos> And she's rationalized her brush with Castor.<eos> Krystal Goderitch is... still naive.<eos> Very.
I'm impressed, Delphine.<eos> You eliminated Rachel, and Sarah's done what no one else could... found the original.<eos> All I found was a council house, burned to the ground.<eos> No casualties, thank goodness.<eos> No trace of any organic material at all.<eos> Ever wonder if you're overplaying your hand?<eos> Constantly.<eos> Rachel was special.<eos> She was so...<eos> Beautifully brittle.
You're not scheduled to work today, and overtime is canceled.<eos> Yeah, well, remember about a week ago when I came in here with a bottle of sparkling cider?<eos> Setting off my sprinklers, drenching my office, destroying a paper crane folded for me by Kevin.<eos> Right, I forgot how that ended.<eos> The point is, that was all just regular cop stuff.<eos> There's no way that can be the reason you've been in such a bad mood.<eos> Bad mood...<eos> I'm sorry, haven't I been bursting into song enough for you lately?<eos> Would you like me to click my heels together or skip like a schoolchild?<eos> Yes to all of that.
Keys, please.<eos> Wasn't that the deal? I don't go into your purse, you don't go into mine.<eos> Y-you can't have the car today, Tessa.<eos> No.<eos> Remember, Susan, Nina, and I are going downtown after school today to line up for Bob Dylan tickets.<eos> So I'll drop you at the office and pick you up when you're done.<eos> I'm not going in this morning.<eos> Then why do you need the car?<eos> Because I have an appointment.<eos> With a-a travel agent.
You may kiss the bride.<eos> The minister just left.<eos> You can take that tie off.<eos> You want to know what's ironic?<eos> Audrey and I split up over having kids.<eos> She wanted one of her own. I said two was enough for me.<eos> I was done.<eos> You could have had more.<eos> You're good with kids.<eos> Just not so good with wives, apparently.
What do we tell them about Jo?<eos> This is about us, Graham.<eos> Just us.<eos> Ann Arbor is a 10-hour drive.<eos> Betty, we're gonna need you to follow up with--<eos> The Little, Brown man?<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> I'm afraid your Lambert Airport delayed us with the luggage.<eos> Mr. Logan and company.
I'm afraid your Lambert Airport delayed us with the luggage.<eos> Mr. Logan and company.<eos> Allow me to introduce you to my research assistants.<eos> This is Mary Lynn, Mary Ann, and Trudy.<eos> They've just flown in from New York with our fragrance samples, and we are ready to get straight to work-- after you sign Mary Lynn's book.<eos> All she's talked about since she stepped on the tarmac.<eos> It would be an honor, Dr. Masters.<eos> I'm something of a scientist myself.<eos> What kind of science?<eos> Astrology.
It's going on two years now.<eos> And because Jane is an old friend, she said she could use her influence to get me in here, which would be great 'cause I want to hire you.<eos> I both understand and sympathize...<eos> Keith.<eos> ...but we have a protocol in place here, Keith, as Jane is fully aware.<eos> Well, I know it's not usually done like this--<eos> Jane also knows that friends do not get preferential treatment here.<eos> You and your wife need to make an appointment through my secretary.<eos> Oh, I don't have a wife.<eos> Fine. With your girlfriend, then.
When was the last time that happened?<eos> I think dinosaurs roamed the Earth.<eos> Nervous?<eos> It's a big swing.<eos> Casino owners... a long-term business strategy for them extends about as far as next week.<eos> All you have to do is explain to them that this is a simple, practical idea.<eos> Well, and soon everyone will be doing it.<eos> Just imagine supermarkets pumping the scent of fresh bread into the aisles.<eos> What smell do you pump into a casino?<eos> Crisp dollar bills?
Virginia, it-- is there any, uh...<eos> particular reason you're insisting he stay here?<eos> I'm making lemonade out of lemons, Bill.<eos> I didn't want Dan Logan to join us as our principle investor, if you'll recall.<eos> I wanted Hugh Hefner.<eos> But you ignored my request, not for the first time, and as a result,<eos> I have found something in his work that adds value to our work, an avenue that invites study.<eos> If you want to investigate the psychosomatic effects of treatment, in five seconds, I could design a study that is far more tailored to our work than some-- some phony sniff test with Logan.<eos> Even if he does go, you can't force me to work on your surrogacy program.<eos> - My surrogacy program?
Enjoy the evening.<eos> We will.<eos> You're home.<eos> As usual.<eos> I supposed you want dinner, as well.<eos> I, uh, haven't even given it a thought.<eos> Where-- where have you been?<eos> I was just next door offering Paul our ballet tickets.<eos> Uh, well, it turns out he's dating someone.<eos> Stephanie.
And you think because my parents were stuffy episcopalians, I must have turned out that way, too?<eos> You have got to be kidding me.<eos> If you can be a surrogate, I don't see any reason why I can't, too.<eos> Nora, you sensed both his vulnerabilities and areas of personal interest.<eos> You're on track for an A-plus in this course.<eos> The surrogates themselves are unknowns and unpredictable.<eos> It's why we train them.<eos> Train them yourself.<eos> I'm busy with our other research.<eos> What other research?
You made an investment.<eos> It paid off-- handsomely, I may add.<eos> When I engaged your services, we entered into a partnership.<eos> Did you see it that way?<eos> A partnership? What? Like Virginia's and mine?<eos> No, actually, because I don't make decisions unilaterally without her participation.<eos> Well, perhaps you can clarify for me.<eos> Uh, what is the argument for, uh, perpetuating this arrangement?<eos> Your venture into, uh... lubricants?<eos> Lotions.
Virginia called the whole thing off a few days before she was supposed to join him in Los Angeles.<eos> Broke his heart, poor fellow.<eos> But I'm sure yours is more resilient.<eos> So you're saying she changed her mind completely on her own with no interference from you?<eos> Oh, no, I asked her to marry me.<eos> Only, uh, it wasn't on bended knee with a ring in my pocket, if that's what you're imagining.<eos> No, the marriage I proposed to her was a marriage of the mind, a true intellectual partnership, and I did it without uttering a word.<eos> All I did was put her name next to mine on that, uh, first paper we presented at Wash U.<eos> It was my vow to her, you know, that that was who we would become-<eos> - Masters and Johnson.
The issues are drunk driving, the assault of a Los Angeles policeman, and most horribly, the corruption of a minor forced into prostitution."<eos> Gisele was a minor?<eos> Well, no, but that's out there now. I mean, she's actually 21.<eos> Which means, and this is positive, she started puberty years ago.<eos> I started puberty when I was 11, which was a nightmare.<eos> I was in a little yellow school skirt--<eos> So, Gisele is 21.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> That's nearly a 50-year age difference, Walter.<eos> With a prostitute.
What were you thinking?<eos> You could, you know, sit in the front seat, sir.<eos> No, I think it's best that our roles are defined.<eos> Discipline in our regiment of two has been slack of late.<eos> Very good, sir.<eos> Thanks for the ride, Rosalie.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Do you want to, you know, like last time?<eos> You smell nice.<eos> Like vanilla.
Don't move.<eos> Hmm. What's this?<eos> It's my answer.<eos> (GASPS) (WHISPERS) I am so gonna wear this to work tomorrow!<eos> Keep going, there's something else.<eos> So, maybe you can use that to locate an actual client.<eos> I can see something I like better already.<eos> You care to go into the other room and share?<eos> On one condition.<eos> What?
He loves you.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> Still here?<eos> Hey, pal.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're skipping the party too?<eos> Yeah, of course I am.<eos> The gall of Peter, leaving us all in the lurch.<eos> Who does he think he is?<eos> Father?
And what did this "Dragon" learn?<eos> He died before I could ask.<eos> Oh, well, that's something you two are about to have in common.<eos> And after he died... I took his research.<eos> And I brought it with me to Storybrooke.<eos> Do you really think this man-child is telling us the truth?<eos> Well, it wouldn't be the first time he's lied to my face.<eos> I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pay a visit to his trailer to find out.<eos> While you're doing that, Shall we carry on with the rest of the plan?<eos> Rest of the plan?
Where is he?<eos> I don't know. [ grunts ]<eos> Do not fool yourself.<eos> I will get my answer. Okay.<eos> Where is he?<eos> All right.<eos> I'm gonna tell you what you want to know.<eos> The sorcerer, uh, trapped the Author behind a door.<eos> The sorcerer?<eos> A door?
Well, because I'm in a generous mood, I'm giving you two days.<eos> After that, I'll have no choice but to shutter your tavern and throw you in debtor's prison.<eos> And poor old Marian here will have no arms to hold her but mine.<eos> She'd never be with you.<eos> I can speak for myself.<eos> I'd never be with you.<eos> Well, when you are on the street and your husband is in jail,<eos> perhaps you'll see my appeal.<eos> I'll find your money.<eos> Somehow.
I have a wife and child.<eos> We need this home, and we're keeping it!<eos> No, no.<eos> Gold?<eos> Gold!<eos> Gold?<eos> Great to see the sheriff didn't scare everyone off.<eos> What can I get for you?<eos> Oh, I didn't come here for the ale.<eos> Nor, clearly, for the ambience.
Thieving is in my blood.<eos> But how to be a thief with honor?<eos> I think I've learned the answer -- by stealing from those who have too much and giving it to those who have too little.<eos> You know Nottingham will want you dead now.<eos> I consider that a victory.<eos> You're the most famous hoodlum in all of Sherwood.<eos> Robin of Locksley will be a walking target.<eos> Well, I shall no longer be known as Robin of Locksley.<eos> This famous hoodlum shall henceforth be known as...<eos> Robin Hood.
But I can't.<eos> I mean, I-I knew that things didn't feel right, but I just didn't know why.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This was all about me.<eos> For her, this was all about...<eos> Making sure I never get my happy ending.<eos> If by happy ending, you mean us, then...<eos> At least, in a way, that's possible again.<eos> Look, it's messy, I know, but...<eos> Between us...
There was a Stable Boy I liked once, and we used to meet underneath it.<eos> Stable Boy?<eos> Well, you certainly have come up in the world since consorting with a lowly Stable Boy, I'd say.<eos> Have I?<eos> I don't feel like I've gone anywhere but down.<eos> Oh, you just need... Some manly arms to lift you up.<eos> Now you let me be the strong one so that you can be weak when you want to be.<eos> Weak?<eos> Well...<eos> Feminine.
But it can still have a happy ending.<eos> How?<eos> I know exactly where to find Regina.<eos> Revenge can be yours.<eos> And what is it that you want in return... aside from your life?<eos> The boy I told you about...<eos> Henry...<eos> He'll be trying to help Regina.<eos> I want you to kill them both.<eos> Gladly.
- Do you have doubts?<eos> - I do.<eos> You said you prefer I speak my mind.<eos> Maybe not so candidly.<eos> It's time to go.<eos> Now, with me!<eos> Hold your position.<eos> Lagus, take that way there.<eos> You stay close to Ka.<eos> With me.
I know this will be difficult at first.<eos> But you have healed more than just my wounds.<eos> You are here because i want you with me.<eos> Even though i'm part mitanni?<eos> This does not matter.<eos> You're an egyptian, as well.<eos> That's not how others will see me.<eos> Out there, we were neither.<eos> Suhad, i am bound to my life here.<eos> My customs, my people, my duty, and yes... The queen.
Do you want me to teach you the rules, suhad?<eos> Another time.<eos> Would you leave us, please?<eos> It was nice to meet you.<eos> And you.<eos> I've asked for more to be carved.<eos> We are egyptians here, Looked upon with envy for our great temples, Our art,<eos> Our happiness. I hope you'll find it here.<eos> Even if i become the pharaoh's wife?<eos> Second wife.
He never believed you could be a great pharaoh.<eos> But you have shown yourself opposite.<eos> Do not let this girl cloud your mind After everything--everything that we've been through.<eos> She is mitanni.<eos> Do not disregard our forefathers.<eos> You preach duty and oath to general horemheb and his men.<eos> This is your duty!<eos> This... Is your oath.<eos> It was not intended.<eos> But inevitable.
Made from the same seeds suhad traded that night.<eos> I overheard that you requested it.<eos> They only serve me wine in this palace.<eos> They think this is beneath me.<eos> A good beer is beneath no one.<eos> My lord.<eos> Lagus.<eos> It seems an age ago, that night in the alley When you came to my aid.<eos> Thank you for being a trusted friend.<eos> A loyal servant.
This will not happen again.<eos> Come.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Do not take him from me.<eos> I have not betrayed you.<eos> My child!<eos> He was my child!<eos> My son!
But if I were him, I wouldn't be taking out any magazine subscriptions.<eos> The D.A.'s office determined Ms. Parsons has rights to tenancy.<eos> And where's that leave Weems?<eos> Well, he can't flip it with her still in residence, so he's settling.<eos> Happily?<eos> I wouldn't characterize it as that.<eos> Begrudgingly, then?<eos> 300 grand, so yeah.<eos> And what are you gonna do to him next?<eos> To who?

Yeah.<eos> You're doing good, Wally.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Says you.<eos> Diego invited me to his class one time.<eos> He taught the fourth grade in the Bronx, poor school.<eos> Very chaotic in the hallways.<eos> But these children, they listened to him.<eos> He was tough and gentle.<eos> And funny.
Her church friends?<eos> Aw, they're a cute bunch.<eos> No, they're not.<eos> They are dirty, dirty birds.<eos> They wanted me to take my book to a dark, dark place, so I'm just gonna stay in here until I can remember something sweet and innocent like holding hands or my first kiss.<eos> Okay, but why in the closet?<eos> Because this is where it happened.<eos> "Seven minutes in heaven" with Stevie Dugan.<eos> It was my 14th birthday party.<eos> Father Dugan?
I told your sister, Tina, I don't know. That's not good enough.<eos> Ew, Tina, this tray is gross!<eos> Too bad you chose chowder day to lie to me.<eos> It's chowder day?<eos> Okay! I don't know for sure, but there's a place Zeke goes sometimes.<eos> He calls it his hidey-hole.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Stop it, Tina!<eos> The storage room!<eos> Over by the science lab!
And go.<eos> Damn, Tina.<eos> Now I got a story to tell on our wedding day.<eos> You think that's not gonna happen, but I'll get you, girl.<eos> I'm gonna get you.<eos> Okay, d-don't say anything, just go.<eos> Zeke, come back here!<eos> Let him go, Mr. Frond.<eos> He's going to see his grandma before she has surgery.<eos> His grandma?
Jack said the gym was on the eighth floor.<eos> Jack sent you here?<eos> Or was it eighth Avenue?<eos> You know, I am so terrible with directions.<eos> I'm so sorry to interrupt.<eos> - Um, ma'am?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Agent Westgate here is gonna need to ask you a few questions before you go.<eos> - Oh.<eos> My pleasure.
You can't order us not to talk to him.<eos> I could arrest you and your partner for interfering in my investigation.<eos> What investigation?<eos> You've been tracking this guy for over a year.<eos> He's still abducting innocent people, holding them for ransom.<eos> You and your partner will remain at the Tashlan Hotel under military guard.<eos> If you try to leave your stay in Uzbekistan will be a lot longer than you bargained for.<eos> Well, you certainly make friends fast.<eos> Truth is, I'm impressed.<eos> - Not with you, with Ruslan. - Heh.
Where?<eos> ~ Over at the Frankenstein place. ~ No.<eos> ~ No, there really is a light, look.<eos> Wow.<eos> Look. Good lord.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Blimey.<eos> GENTLE LAUGHTER I was 17, this was in summer 1983 and I had FIVE part-time jobs.<eos> ~ And one of them was in... ~ Five?<eos> Why? ~ How?
Well, I think you should make an effort.<eos> ~ It's Caroline's big day...<eos> ~ Big day?<eos> ~ Getting married to another woman?<eos> ~ But...<eos> You were just saying how nice it were when Kate popped round.<eos> Yeah, well, that was yesterday.<eos> Don't let this other business spoil... ~ Where did you do it?<eos> ~ What?<eos> Sex.
You were just saying how nice it were when Kate popped round.<eos> Yeah, well, that was yesterday.<eos> Don't let this other business spoil... ~ Where did you do it?<eos> ~ What?<eos> Sex.<eos> You and Mary?<eos> I'm not going there...<eos> I'm assuming you couldn't take her back to your house, because Gillian and Eileen would be there.<eos> And who did she live with?<eos> Her mum and dad,
To cool you down a little bit.<eos> There we go.<eos> Can you open up a little bit'?<eos> Just going to take your temperature.<eos> Open.<eos> A little bit more.<eos> A little bit more.<eos> Just get it under.<eos> There we go.<eos> Close.
Because I'm trying to get rid of you.<eos> This is your 25th wedding anniversary.<eos> It's a momentous occasion.<eos> And I promised Dr. McCord I'd get you out of here on time.<eos> You did?<eos> Well, he warned me that you always dragged your feet before taking a vacation.<eos> Even before you were Secretary of State.<eos> And he's expecting Herculean resistance to this one.<eos> You and Henry talk behind my back?<eos> Frequently.
Why don't we set some ground rules for our little stroll down memory lane?<eos> Such as?<eos> We go off the grid.<eos> - No phones, no computers, - Oh... no TV, just anything with an âonâ button.<eos> Look, I know you're nervous 'cause it's your first time away from the office, but you've got a great staff.<eos> They wouldn't be working for you if they weren't great.<eos> So they will find you if something big comes up.<eos> Okay.<eos> Off the grid, swear.<eos> Off.

I apologize for my temerity earlier.<eos> I very much wanted to see you, but I-I wasn't sure how you'd react.<eos> You are my son, Henry.<eos> I hoped and prayed you were still alive.<eos> In my dream, you said that you killed Moloch in order to save my life.<eos> I did.<eos> Instinct, pure and primal... or so I thought.<eos> Now I realize it was something more.<eos> Destiny.<eos> Our destiny.
It was always meant to be the two of us.<eos> I've always needed her.<eos> I am sorry it took me so long to see the truth.<eos> The idea that a mortal man and I could truly make a life together...<eos> You... be wary.<eos> What you're saying now cannot be unsaid.<eos> In a way, it is a relief to finally be able to speak it.<eos> I do not belong here in this time.<eos> Among humankind.<eos> Beside you.
I did not abandon you, Henry.<eos> I did not even know you existed.<eos> You're as much a man out of time as I.<eos> Yet you cling to the past so tightly like an angry, unruly child.<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> Thank you, Mother.<eos> How many Witnesses did I say were specified in the Bible?<eos> You may be one short of a pair.<eos> This is how a mother nurtures her son.<eos> Murder in cold blood.
- But Jason's got his number.<eos> Should we call the dean, maybe?<eos> Or maybe talk to his parents.<eos> I don't think we're there yet.<eos> We should let him handle him on his own.<eos> - What if he's a bully?<eos> - He is a bully.<eos> See, that's bad, because we have to stay on top of bullying.<eos> It's-it's the new...<eos> Bullying?
Except, I know you're good at what you do.<eos> Really gifted.<eos> I know that sometimes that makes things lonely.<eos> I know what that's like.<eos> To be alone.<eos> To be lonely.<eos> Maybe I read too much into situations and what people say.<eos> Don't think so.<eos> I think you're a very good judge of a situation.<eos> So the other night...
No.<eos> She just called about that leftover cobbler you brought home last week.<eos> What?<eos> Isn't it nice that we have something in common besides you?<eos> Do you think she knows about...<eos> Us?<eos> Not from me.<eos> We are moving slowly, Emily.<eos> And I am perfectly fine with you and me staying just between you and me.<eos> And your husband.
Me?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm getting a little tired of memorializing Mona.<eos> Mrs. Horowitz keeps talking about her.<eos> She's just trying to understand what happened like the rest of us.<eos> I suppose.<eos> Looks like she's ready to nominate Mona for sainthood.<eos> Our best scholar, our martyred hero, like she won every championship on her own.<eos> I guess she was a pretty aggressive competitor.<eos> Not aggressive, vicious.
That is a nice thing to say, but I'm not as strong as he was... is.<eos> I'm not as strong as he is.<eos> He's a good man.<eos> I'm bleeding.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Oh, God! That's a new fucking carpet!<eos> The Caspian sturgeon has been hunted to the brink of extinction.<eos> You'll find it on America's list of endangered species, which, of course, makes it illegal to import.<eos> Thus, incredibly rare.<eos> And incredibly expensive.
I liked you.<eos> I still do.<eos> But the only woman you'll ever love is Shannon.<eos> You were my Shannon, Leroy.<eos> I'll give you a moment.<eos> No.<eos> Have you told Fornell?<eos> No, I'm gonna do that in person.<eos> I just wanted to talk to you.<eos> Me?
No worries. I'll do it.<eos> 'Cause you don't want my grubby peasant hands on it?<eos> No, silly Billy.<eos> I can do it myself. Boop.<eos> Okay, I'm still in bed dreaming, and I'm gonna be late for work.<eos> (Laughs)<eos> Elliot, you're in a pretty good mood, considering your big 4-0 is tomorrow.<eos> I thought you might be freaking out.<eos> More like getting my freak on.<eos> With Andre.
I don't know.<eos> You realize this puts me in a very awkward situation again.<eos> You want to talk awkward?<eos> Listen, you have lived with this your whole life.<eos> You know what it's like.<eos> I need to know what I'm supposed to do to deal with it.<eos> Well, first off, you need to be more careful.<eos> Obviously, most people can't accept what we are.<eos> Reactions can be violent.<eos> Deadly, even.
Are you all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I tried to stop it, sean.<eos> I'm sorry. I just -- i-i couldn't --<eos> I know.<eos> I know. Just... Just come home.<eos> I can't.<eos> Not yet. I have to talk to her.<eos> To him...
Minx!<eos> Anything?<eos> No.<eos> Minx!<eos> Minx?<eos> Sean, wait!<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Keep going.<eos> She's just up ahead.<eos> Over that ridge.
It's just not what I would do.<eos> Oh, enlighten us all.<eos> What would you do?<eos> This demon asks you to equalize credit for his and another's work -- split the baby, if you will.<eos> Well then I would well and truly split the baby.<eos> I'd cut this puling, pathetic, greed-grubbing git in two, literally, then I'd nail his bloody halves to the doors of the court -- a reminder to all not to waste the king's time.<eos> Whiners beget whiners.<eos> You can't reward behavior like that -- why I never gave in when you asked for sweeties as a child, no matter how much you cried.<eos> Well, you were a very... chunky child, darling.<eos> Bit of a bloater.
These bodies?<eos> Just cleaning up a mess I made a long time ago.<eos> Cain, I know what you were.<eos> But you'd resisted for so long.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I got the taste back.<eos> With Abaddon's army gunning for me, I had to take up arms again, and I liked how it felt.<eos> Those were demons.<eos> These...<eos> Humans.
Consorting with hunters!<eos> Oh, me.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> You honestly believe that they're your friends, that they care about you? !<eos> Kid here?<eos> He's nearby.<eos> Upstairs in the barn.<eos> He's playing with a basketball.<eos> Cain will strike soon.<eos> Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow, but soon.
Over a hundred years old.<eos> So, Angie's just factoring that into her map now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Manganese.<eos> Mm-hmm. That's good.<eos> I worked with Connor for almost a year, so you'll understand if I find it a little hard to believe that he planned a major crime.<eos> Perhaps your idealistic views of rehabilitation were unrealistic, Mr. Flender.<eos> Well, it's always better to hope, isn't it?<eos> - I agree.<eos> Yes, a victim.
Now.<eos> - But you just said...<eos> - Do what I say and this little ruse stays between us.<eos> Otherwise, you can kiss your career goodbye.<eos> Hello?<eos> Olivia, you're gonna want to get down here.<eos> Shelley's at your apartment.<eos> - My apartment?<eos> - She's with some dude.<eos> - What dude?
Yes?<eos> So you just watched them drive away and you did nothing?<eos> There were two of them, and your daughter is seven feet tall.<eos> I felt a physical confrontation would have been asymmetrical.<eos> - Then why didn't you follow them?<eos> - I am following them.<eos> I slapped a GPS tracker on the guy's truck, and my guy at the DMV is running plates.<eos> They won't get far.<eos> She's taken up with a common thief.<eos> An addict, probably.
Without question, but you, Roman, also should have been sharing with me.<eos> From the very start.<eos> While I understand your instincts, she is your baby after all, but from now on we need to work together.<eos> Well, we gotta do something.<eos> She's never gonna stop.<eos> Actually, we don't have to do anything, because she is going to stop.<eos> Your mother has the LPS cancer.<eos> She's getting sicker every day.<eos> She will deteriorate and become hideous.<eos> A monster really, or...
Okay.<eos> - I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> - Yeah. I know.<eos> - You told me at the funeral.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I still am.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I just wish I was there with him at the end, you know, but at least he was surrounded by his friends having fun, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What kind of fun?
That shit doesn't work for me.<eos> A fucking priest man told me so himself.<eos> I don't know what this priest told you or what you think you heard, but I do know this:<eos> "There are many rooms in my father's house."<eos> Room for me?<eos> I'm 100% certain there's no room at the inn.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Remember what happens if he finds out.<eos> To him.<eos> To you.
So many.<eos> All swimming.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - Poor Eve.<eos> He wants his rib back.<eos> I am real big now.<eos> It hurts so bad.<eos> Tell me where the fuck she is.<eos> Adam!<eos> With Adam.
Surrender your vessel.<eos> Thank you for coming, General.<eos> Would you care to sit?<eos> I'm fine as I am.<eos> Shall we toast the French?<eos> I think it they who should be toasting us.<eos> Providence is on our side, not the papists.<eos> We're all on the same side now.<eos> Well... providence favors the righteous.<eos> And the bold.
Makes me want to kill you.<eos> We got what we needed.<eos> That was our assignment.<eos> Yeah, let's just hope you got what we needed.<eos> I'm uploading the LIDAR data now.<eos> Use your wizardry to make it work, Gandalf.<eos> FBI's moving their equipment into the gym to help work the case.<eos> Coincidentally, while you were waiting for your exfil, several... suspected members of the Al Tunis Brigade boarded an Air France flight to Paris, with a direct connection to Mexico City.<eos> You contact FBI and Homeland Security?<eos> Yes, and Border Patrol.
Avoiding all drug tunnels, of course.<eos> Now, the goddess of the land took pity on them.<eos> She changed the young man into a giant cactus, and she took the spirit of the young woman and put it into the plant.<eos> Occasionally, the young woman emerges to enjoy the view, in the form of a cactus flower.<eos> Protected and together for eternity.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, arriba!<eos> Arriba!<eos> Abajo!<eos> Al centro!<eos> Y pa'dentro!
You're the mayor.<eos> Everyone loves you.<eos> What's your day?<eos> Budget meeting.<eos> Need to get a pothole fixed on Earl.<eos> But the county fair pretty much bled us dry.<eos> What about you?<eos> What are you gonna do today?<eos> Boysenberries.<eos> Boysenberries.
Ellie?<eos> Get a grip of yourself, Gilmour.<eos> Be nonchalant.<eos> You've moved on.<eos> Let her do the talking.<eos> Grier?<eos> Stewart Gilmour, as I live and breathe.<eos> Interesting. You look relieved and disappointed at the same time.<eos> I guess you thought I was my sister.<eos> Story of my life.
If you're amenable,<eos> I'd like to ask you a few more questions.<eos> I already told you...<eos> Please? It'll only take a moment.<eos> I'll give you five minutes.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> There's an unmarked police car parked in front of your building.<eos> I'd rather they not catch a glimpse of me through your windows.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Not tonight.
Ah, the princess we've been waiting for.<eos> Do you know your King?<eos> - Is it me?<eos> - Or is it me?<eos> - Which one do you want it to be?<eos> - I cannot say.<eos> She cannot say oh dear!<eos> - You'll dance with me I hope.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Why not with me?
Joanne potts, until she moved to colorado, and then you hung out With the next door neighbor boy until puberty made things weird.<eos> And his name was?<eos> -Larry something...<eos> -Gable.<eos> (grunts)<eos> Very good. You know, it's kind of weird, but ravi reminds me of him a little.<eos> They're both geeks, but confident.<eos> It's a nice mix.<eos> How are things going?<eos> With ravi?
I thought you said you were happy to have an excuse to chuck it in.<eos> Yeah, but now the euphoria's died down the reality is that, in a few short days, I'm going to be skint.<eos> In fact, that's why I'm here.<eos> Is there somewhere we can talk?<eos> Harry and Raff and Calamity are hogging the sitting room, so... fire away.<eos> I've suggested this before, and you know it's a good idea.<eos> But then things got messy cos of that John. Twat.<eos> But... look.<eos> I've seen the light.<eos> With Cheryl.
I don't like being dependent... on people.<eos> I know that, Gillian.<eos> Well, what would...?<eos> You mean, like... ~ you'd sell your house and come and live here, and...?<eos> ~ Yeah. Married.<eos> It isn't about being dependent.<eos> It's about sharing.<eos> Everything.<eos> Pooling our resources and... yeah, being equal.<eos> Partners.
Not that...<eos> Not that... Not that what?<eos> Not that it'd have done me any good finishing my A levels.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't know what you might have done.<eos> I love drinking too much at lunch time.<eos> Sod it.<eos> I mean, y'know...<eos> I've lost my job, I've no money, my dad's fallen out with his...<eos> girlfriend, ladies, wife, woman.
Before you turned up. He came over.<eos> And, look, whatever the hell we were talking about yesterday, when we'd had a few, it's not going to work.<eos> It's not ever going to be a good idea, is it?<eos> ~ OK?<eos> So... ~ Why isn't it?<eos> Why not?<eos> Thank you for driving my dad over.<eos> I meant what I said.<eos> About helping out.<eos> Financially.
~ Well, tell him not to come, then.<eos> ~ I can't do that.<eos> ~ Why?<eos> Because... yesterday morning, before you turned up... .. he asked me to marry him.<eos> And then, God knows how many hours later, I'm in bed with you.<eos> Because I'm stupid and flaky and I'm fed up of being those things!<eos> ~ You don't want to marry him.<eos> ~ Don't I?<eos> I asked you to marry me.<eos> More or less.
~ To another woman.<eos> Really?<eos> Good.<eos> Wow.<eos> Good for her!<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I think I'll do that next time.<eos> Can you pass the erm...?<eos> So... she was married to a man.<eos> John, yeah.
Good.<eos> Wow.<eos> Good for her!<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I think I'll do that next time.<eos> Can you pass the erm...?<eos> So... she was married to a man.<eos> John, yeah.<eos> ~ For years.<eos> ~ John.
No, yes, it is. Technically.<eos> Women could do without men.<eos> Men couldn't reproduce without women.<eos> Look at chickens,<eos> ~ the way chickens are farmed.<eos> ~ Chickens?<eos> They gas them at birth.<eos> Then they just keep one or two to do the necessary.<eos> It's t'same wi' sheep.<eos> And cattle.
Yo. It's your pops.<eos> Tell him to go to hell.<eos> Or wherever he sent Camilla at with his damn extortion money.<eos> They can burn there together.<eos> Aretheboyscoming to Hakeem's thing?<eos> Uh, Jamal has his own album release events this weekend.<eos> Well, what about Andre?<eos> Uh, he'll be back at work on Monday.<eos> No, is he coming tonight? Him and Rhonda.<eos> I really...
He's in the Berkshires for the long weekend, sir.<eos> He cleared it with you.<eos> Hakeem!<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> Ready?<eos> I was born ready.<eos> That's what I like.<eos> I ain't got nothin' to do with that, Brother Lucious.<eos> I ain't got nothin' to do with that.<eos> LUCIOUS:
But you got one.<eos> Your last assignment.<eos> I was on a team.<eos> Gaad tells me you worked in Arkansas with the White Supremacists.<eos> Yeah, seems like a long time ago now.<eos> I'd like to buy you a beer sometime-- hear those war stories.<eos> I'm not much on war stories.<eos> But I'll take the beer.<eos> I got to go babysit Zin-<eos> - Zi-- the defector.
Questions?<eos> Yeah, can I start?<eos> You guys mind if I start?<eos> I'll start.<eos> Are you out of your shitting mind?<eos> Sterling!<eos> Excuse me?<eos> He literally stabbed me in the back!<eos> Because you jeopardized his mission.<eos> What mission?
Obviously.<eos> You think-- [chuckles] okay.<eos> Wow. You think, in the event of their deaths,<eos> That you would be a.J.'s legal guardian?<eos> Who else would they possibly choose?<eos> You've met yourself, right?<eos> If it's anybody around here, it's me.<eos> Of course.<eos> The one who smokes next to the baby.<eos> Dukes!
No!<eos> Revenge rampage!<eos> [continues humming]<eos> How do you still have two hands?<eos> You cyborg son of a bi-- [groans] [music stops]<eos> Of sugar.<eos> [groans] [raspy voice] oh, good.<eos> You're making tea.<eos> 'cause I could use some with honey and lemon.<eos> [coughs] and bourbon.
What's new?<eos> How you been?<eos> Sharper image? Uh-huh.<eos> Sounds more like krieger.<eos> Jesus christ!<eos> Will he not rest<eos> Until we've all been enslaved by skynet?<eos> Hey, we are leaving in five, so--<eos> Right after I enjoy this yerba mate and caÃ±a smoothie<eos> With a wd-40 float.
Oh, no!<eos> Hang on!<eos> Whoa whoa whoa whoa!<eos> Hang on!<eos> I got a key, ya skimpnuts.<eos> Oh yeah, me, too.<eos> Why do you have keys to her apartment?<eos> Ron gave them to us,<eos> When they were doing that weird open-house thing.<eos> Open marriage.
[sigh] really regret sharing that with you...<eos> So, you think crash is dead, or...?<eos> I mean, he'd have to be, right?<eos> And either way...<eos> I say we say he's dead.<eos> [mumbled agreement] Yeah, right?<eos> Seems like a win-win.<eos> Unless you're him...<eos> Or the other three.<eos> But seriously, how in the hell
He's lucky I love him.<eos> And he's a resident and hardly home at night.<eos> Or he'd be dead.<eos> I miss sleeping with a man in my bed.<eos> You know, facing away from each other, barely touching expect for just the arm thrown over your waist.<eos> When I'd wake up at night, terrified of... me, I liked knowing he was there and I wasn't by myself.<eos> I cannot sleep with someone lying next to me.<eos> Literally cannot.<eos> My one serious guy?<eos> Dean.
Hey.<eos> How'd it go with the kids?<eos> Uh, great.<eos> Uh, they're amazing.<eos> I just dropped them off at daycare.<eos> Thanks again for watching them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How about you?<eos> How was your weekend... in D.C...<eos> With your husband?
Why don't you just tell him the truth?<eos> Because it would kill him.<eos> I mean, he wants to take things to the next level, but the more that he feels, the less I do.<eos> And then today, we were in the park, and he got down on one knee and he looked up at me with his big wet eyes,<eos> - so I just...<eos> - Faked it. I didn't realize how close I was to the steps.<eos> But I had to go with it all the way down.<eos> You can really commit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But not to Todd.
It's her song.<eos> So get off the stage, let her sing it.<eos> No, could you please stop with that?<eos> I feel like it was all a lie, you know?<eos> Our whole life... He lied to me.<eos> Well, Curt needs your help now.<eos> Yeah, well, it's... it's a little late to ask.<eos> Should've asked 25 years ago.<eos> Mnh-mnh. I'm... I'm done with him.<eos> Her.
Yeah, there's no room up here for an uptight buzzkill.<eos> Don't call her a buzzkill.<eos> That's right.<eos> There's a lot of people who think I'm fun.<eos> You complain about fireworks Friday, you complain when my son plays his kick-ass drum set, you bought curtains for your bedroom window.<eos> What have we ever done to you?<eos> I think you just answered your own question.<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> Here, take your buzz-free banana bread - and go back to your precious driveway.<eos> - Oh. With pleasure.
Once you fill out the online form, they use a matchmaker algorithm to pick your ideal mate.<eos> And then you set up a coffee date in the Reverie Meet-and-Mingle lounge.<eos> So you don't actually meet face-to-face.<eos> Not at first.<eos> Only your avatars.<eos> We like to say it was love at first byte. With a "Y."<eos> Seven years and counting.<eos> And now you're gonna be parents.<eos> And was, um... was this pregnancy planned, or...<eos> Complete accident.
So please stop second-guessing me.<eos> So is that what you're gonna wear back to the hospital?<eos> Nope, but I am gonna have a drink in it.<eos> Who's the kid?<eos> Ethan.<eos> He was my son.<eos> I didn't know you had a son.<eos> Yeah, well... he was a Humanich.<eos> He was a what?<eos> A robot.
He-he didn't mention anything to you about where he might be going, or...<eos> Um, hs mentioned a lot.<eos> Okay, I'm pulling up our last conversation.<eos> The entire history of us.<eos> - Ah. - Ah? What...<eos> Sorry.<eos> That was his birthday.<eos> Um... wait.<eos> Wait, he was curious about a woman.<eos> A woman?
Well, when we locate the targets, and we're working on that.<eos> But you just consider this your basic training.<eos> And you passed with flying colors, Lucy.<eos> - Julie, a word?<eos> - Sure.<eos> See?<eos> Aren't you glad you didn't install the limiters?<eos> I told you I'd be much better without them.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> With Lucy?
And you passed with flying colors, Lucy.<eos> - Julie, a word?<eos> - Sure.<eos> See?<eos> Aren't you glad you didn't install the limiters?<eos> I told you I'd be much better without them.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> With Lucy?<eos> I thought you were happy with...<eos> With Ethan.
I didn't come home alone.<eos> The child, part human, part alien, was unlike anything the world had ever seen.<eos> My other child... - is a lifelike android.<eos> - Mom?<eos> He has become the prototype for a new breed of thinking machines... called Humanichs.<eos> These two extraordinary new life-forms now hold the key to Earth's future.<eos> But where does that leave us?<eos> Over 99% of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct.<eos> What if it's our time?<eos> Previously on Extant...
What about her?<eos> _<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing at all.<eos> As you know, there were concerns about putting you on the virus team.<eos> I protected you.<eos> I believed in you.<eos> And you didn't disappoint.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> On what?
It's time for you and I to have a little chat.<eos> How the hell did you get in here?<eos> This gun says I don't answer questions.<eos> Ah. You looking for this?<eos> Oh, yeah, I dismantled your little panic button.<eos> Cool feature, very high-tech.<eos> So where are we going?<eos> How about you just drive.<eos> My son was so strong.<eos> So happy.
- You're really stoked about this, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Once they wake up, my family's going to be even bigger.<eos> - Your family?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Lucy's my sister, so that makes all these new Humanichs my brothers and sisters.<eos> - So what does that make me?<eos> - My BHF.<eos> - Your what?<eos> - My Best Human Friend.
you know that.<eos> The more human experience you give me, the more human I become.<eos> I can be so much more if you let me.<eos> Wait, hold on.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, this is...<eos> this is illegal.<eos> It's like misuse of government property or something.<eos> Is that all I am?<eos> Property?
And Orion wanted the sisters all to himself, so he chased them to the ends of the earth.<eos> But just when he thought he had them trapped, the most powerful god in the universe,<eos> Zeus... came along to rescue them.<eos> You came to rescue us from the hunters.<eos> Are you a god?<eos> No.<eos> None of us are gods.<eos> But you're still what Daddy says you are.<eos> - And what is that?<eos> - Our leader.
I didn't come home alone.<eos> The child, part human, part alien, was unlike anything the world had ever seen.<eos> My other child... - is a lifelike android.<eos> - Mom?<eos> He has become the prototype for a new breed of thinking machines... called Humanichs.<eos> These two extraordinary new life-forms now hold the key to Earth's future.<eos> But where does that leave us?<eos> Over 99% of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct.<eos> What if it's our time?<eos> Previously on Extant...
He fought for us, helped us when he didn't have to.<eos> - He's a true hero. - Mm.<eos> Whatever you decide, I understand.<eos> You have my daughter and now you have me.<eos> Let her go.<eos> Wait...<eos> Wait, this is illegal.<eos> It's, like, misuse of government property or something.<eos> Is that all I am?<eos> Property?
I went to space on a 13-month solo mission.<eos> I didn't come home alone.<eos> The child, part human, part alien, was unlike anything the world had ever seen.<eos> My other child... - is a lifelike android. - Mom?<eos> He has become the prototype for a new breed of thinking machines... called Humanichs.<eos> These two extraordinary new life-forms now hold the key to Earth's future.<eos> But where does that leave us?<eos> Over 99% of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct.<eos> What if it's our time?<eos> Previously on Extant...
She doesn't have the authority.<eos> No, whoever made that call came from above.<eos> But every time I sniff around, the trail goes cold.<eos> Maybe you're not inhaling deep enough, General.<eos> Don't you think that I want to know the truth?<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe it's this... presidential scotch kicking in, but I actually believe you.<eos> Sometimes decisions are made that leave no fingerprints.<eos> And there are people above me, nameless people who always get what they want.<eos> - No matter the cost.
I've got a motive too.<eos> - Want to hear it?<eos> - Please.<eos> Reggie was a backstabbing, small-minded, petty...<eos> Stop it!<eos> He walked out on Enid, walked out on our double-act.<eos> Where were you both at the time of the murder?<eos> Having a stroll in the fields.<eos> Together?<eos> In the dark?
You're clutching at straws.<eos> And you, once again, are stepping way outside your bounds.<eos> - What about the burnt fabric...?<eos> - Goodbye, Father.<eos> There's something you need to know -<eos> Laura Hope is under Welkin's influence.<eos> She's been coerced into marrying him.<eos> Yes. Well, Welkin has an alibi.<eos> He was at a pub sing-a-long at the exact time.<eos> A sing-a-long?
I'm sorry, Laurence.<eos> I had to. I can't be an accessory to murder.<eos> Felicia, you must believe that I didn't kill him.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> Can we go now, please?<eos> Now that I've made an arrest, you're no longer suspects.<eos> So, yes, you can go.<eos> Thank you for your patience, Father.<eos> There is some unfinished business.<eos> Well, Lieutenant and Sid.

You'll be seeing a lot more of that.<eos> Julie wouldn't mind.<eos> ETHAN: Charlie?<eos> MAN [over P.A.]: Attention.<eos> Please cooperate with security forces.<eos> They are here for your protection.<eos> Pain in the ass, all this security.<eos> It's a crock.<eos> You ask me, more people were killed last year by bad eggs than by terrorists.<eos> [chuckles]: Not my bad eggs.
Was not such a good idea.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> You are "Tommy with a Smile".<eos> - What happened next?<eos> - I have made withdrawal and started again from scratch.<eos> Maybe I should frighten me now. But the really interesting people all have something already undergone.<eos> Also fits better to you now, where will you get laid all types.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> Who knows, maybe I'll do even a threesome?<eos> Of course, not with another guy.
Sorry, my pocket.<eos> Hush, sorry.<eos> Sorry. My pocket becomes caught.<eos> I'm not a groupie or something.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can I still invite you for a drink?<eos> - I am Guy.<eos> - Leni.<eos> Actually, I'm here with someone.<eos> - A guy?
Do you think Frank Winter would surrender quietly?<eos> Sands shift during wartime.<eos> No one-- no one has tenure.<eos> The ones who survive are the ones who adapt.<eos> Next time, call me directly.<eos> My name is Avram Fisher.<eos> Where are my manners?<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - For surviving or adapting?<eos> For the baby.
But you wanted a daughter so badly.<eos> We both did.<eos> And you proved the doctors wrong.<eos> Right out of the gates, you said it felt like a boy, and you were right about that, too.<eos> Thought I'd never see you again.<eos> I mean, for all I knew, you were dead.<eos> And then you came in the door and you said that I poisoned our marriage.<eos> Listen.<eos> Whatever happened between me and you or me and her<eos> - or you and--
Because I am merciful.<eos> Move along.<eos> Clear the way there!<eos> Peter.<eos> Tell me what's troubling you.<eos> Everything's changing so quickly.<eos> You knew this wasn't going to be easy.<eos> Bad things are gonna happen...<eos> To me...<eos> The others.
Hold those horses.<eos> We're not moving to New Athens.<eos> Just to visit, to see it, living life the old way.<eos> There's crime in New Athens.<eos> God, I hope so, and litter and hot dog stands, which are notoriously bad for you.<eos> And you love.<eos> You know what else they have?<eos> They have art, and they have culture, and they're awake, Amy.<eos> It might be good for all of us to remember how things once were, you know?<eos> Warts and all.
Junkyard dog.<eos> Give him my love when you see him.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm heading there right now.<eos> Oh, hang on a sec, if that's the case.<eos> I ordered extra, hoping this moment would come.<eos> You tell padre that when he's back on his feet again, the Wicker Park Wolverines could use an assistant coach who actually knows something about hockey.<eos> Now Cruz may not know anything about hockey, but me...<eos> Do you guys have any idea who chaplain Orlovsky actually grew up playing with?<eos> No, who?
- I will give him that.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So, I guess this is everything.<eos> Listen, you shouldn't be doing this.<eos> Pat, the kids should be on cleanup.<eos> - Thanks very much.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I carry my own load, honey.<eos> So, big free-trade negotiations going on, huh?<eos> Yeah, with Brazil.
Somehow I'm not surprised to see you stopping by.<eos> Good.<eos> Then you know I need you to release the Bahraini consular officer.<eos> That's a request for local authorities.<eos> Please don't be coy, Madam Secretary.<eos> We all know you're driving this train.<eos> Well, then you also know why I won't allow the Hassanis' release.<eos> I'm sure you're aware of our base in Manama.<eos> I am highly sensitive to our strategic post there.<eos> And also our billion-dollar renovation.
And Mrs...<eos> Are they angry at me?<eos> I'm more concerned about you.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Good.<eos> When can I work?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I came here today to tell you in person:<eos> I spoke with Prince Yousif about you.<eos> Prince Yousif?
Professor Milton is Vince Lennon's next of kin?<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> He was eight.<eos> An evacuee from some godforsaken slum where he'd never known anything but abuse.<eos> When his family were killed in a bombing raid, my brother and I adopted him.<eos> That was very altruistic.<eos> Humane.<eos> Vince was, well, he was a very damaged child.<eos> Filthy and malnourished.<eos> Almost feral at first.
Gibbs.<eos> What did he do?<eos> He tried to...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're busy.<eos> - Tea? - Tea is for gossip.<eos> Brandy for shock.<eos> Careful with that decanter.<eos> Wedding present from my late husband.<eos> Along with this...
Yes, well, the colonel wants to save us the bother of sending him to the scaffold.<eos> So, for once, our professional interests coincide.<eos> It's your duty to stop him committing a mortal sin and mine to see him stand trial.<eos> I'd like you to talk to him.<eos> Stop him from trying again.<eos> - You think he will?<eos> - We've taken his sheets but, as you know, there are many ways for a man to kill himself.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> At least this should put your mind at rest.<eos> How so?
- I certainly didn't kill anyone.<eos> - No.<eos> But there is a killer in this room.<eos> Isn't there?<eos> Yes, all right.<eos> - I confess.<eos> - Monsieur Bisset!<eos> But, please, it was an accident.<eos> He just ran in front of the car.<eos> - The car?
Maybe Tess and I should sneak into Thomas' office, see what we can find.<eos> No, it's way too dicey.<eos> DHS didn't even know what Thomas was working on.<eos> It might be our only shot.<eos> Uh, what is that?<eos> Uh, that is...<eos> That is my-my flat screen.<eos> Oh, it's quite large.<eos> Uh, where were you thinking of putting it?<eos> Right there above the fireplace.
Just be the old JT, that's all I care about.<eos> Come here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Fine.<eos> Hey.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Not great.<eos> I almost lost it again.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> With Cat?
But he insists that you are the lawful queen.<eos> A stand that protects his hold on power as well.<eos> You are on the cusp of losing your country.<eos> Either you or Elizabeth will rule<eos> Scotland and England.<eos> Make an heir, and it will be you.<eos> Why didn't you tell your mother what happened to you?<eos> Every time I talk about it, I relive it.<eos> I simply didn't want to.<eos> Not with her.
I know, and I think it's terrible...<eos> Oh, I know you do.<eos> So warm and frank in your approach to things. To Mary.<eos> Makes her feel like a regular girl.<eos> But she is not a regular girl.<eos> Mary is a queen who must be seen as a force of nature.<eos> Anything less endangers her.<eos> And you and your son make her seem... deficient.<eos> Useless.<eos> Disposable.
I want a good life, and a husband to share it with.<eos> And I'm sick of being judged for it just because you want less.<eos> Less comfort.<eos> Less responsibility.<eos> Less of me.<eos> You.<eos> How have I offended you now?<eos> One question.<eos> Could sex with you be simple?<eos> Not scary?
It would've been nice to get a heads-up.<eos> I'm sorry, dear.<eos> You know how I struggle with my communication skills.<eos> Now, run off and do your job.<eos> Protect and serve...<eos> Me.<eos> The guy's a bully, and you're just laying back and taking it.<eos> Act like his bitch, don't expect to be treated like his girlfriend.<eos> Before this brain, my advice-giving M.O. was gentle.<eos> Sympathetic.
It matters.<eos> It doesn't.<eos> We have nothing in common other than being half-dead.<eos> That's not the basis of a healthy relationship.<eos> I have a feeling that the woman whose brain you ate never had a healthy relationship in her life.<eos> How do you know it was a woman?<eos> She's exhausting.<eos> I thought that being a relationship and sex expert might be a little fun, but...<eos> Sorry, excuse me.<eos> A what expert?
Take her hand, exchange pleasantries, standard introductory behavior.<eos> If you want to meet her, come here.<eos> See, that sounded like you telling me what to do.<eos> Oh, is this the part where you threaten my mom again?<eos> Because that's brave.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.<eos> That was uncalled for.<eos> After all, what has your mum ever done to me?<eos> Well, except that one night...
Nope. I can't.<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm gonna call you a cab.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> My mom just died as in I just put her dead, cancer-riddled body into the ground 4 hours and 32 minutes ago.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> I'm just saying that my feet have been crammed in the world's most uncomfortable heels for an entire day, and your tequila is the only thing that seems to be helping.<eos> Ok.
- What?<eos> Girlfriend?<eos> We all know you're not dating Elena Gilbert.<eos> Why would I be dating Elena?<eos> You wouldn't, but even if you were, it wouldn't matter because nothing matters, not... a... thing.<eos> - Caroline!<eos> - Aah!<eos> Elena: It's like she never lived here.<eos> How's her house?<eos> Totally empty.
Well, now, darling, that's a colorful story...<eos> Exactly the kind of tall tale you had a penchant for telling back at the institution before they fixed your head.<eos> It's no tall tale.<eos> I know exactly what happened the night Daddy died.<eos> I was in my bedroom, and I heard arguing.<eos> - Your judge forgot something!<eos> - Don't you ever...<eos> Daddy found out you were cheating on him...<eos> Don't you laugh at me!<eos> ...with Judge Miller.
He didn't want to share any of this with me.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> He wanted to, but... your mom...<eos> Well, she had other ideas.<eos> She treats him like he's the plague.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> She fell in love with him. Why couldn't she accept him for who he was?<eos> Which was?<eos> I don't know...<eos> Bisexual...
You pulled an all-nighter at the E.R.<eos> Well, yeah, I'd been up all night.<eos> But I certainly wasn't saving anyone.<eos> I'd been with him.<eos> We'd gotten into the Dexedrine, among other things.<eos> Vodka, among other things.<eos> We'd been partying for 20 hours straight.<eos> Medical students do this, but not as much as I did.<eos> It's like I was two...<eos> Two different people.
Vodka, among other things.<eos> We'd been partying for 20 hours straight.<eos> Medical students do this, but not as much as I did.<eos> It's like I was two...<eos> Two different people.<eos> There's one that was gonna be this great doctor, and the other one...<eos> Might never even have survived.<eos> And there it was.<eos> You...<eos> With your decency.
Yes.<eos> Connie knows that I have separate insurance under the Medicaid and the supplement.<eos> Hi, Britton.<eos> I'm so, so glad you came back.<eos> I'm having an ambulance take you to the hospital, and I'll come with you.<eos> Carpe diem, I thought that it meant to seize sex, drugs, and abandonment in every possible moment.<eos> If you can believe it, so did I.<eos> But I learned a little trick.<eos> Let's take it by the hour until the hours add up to something larger.<eos> - Larger?

- Hey, Gary.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Hey, Tom.<eos> Wow, your stealth kill approach is coming along nicely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So I wanted to pick your therapist brain for a second about this problem that a friend of mine is having at home.<eos> Oh, well, you know, I prefer to talk to people directly about their personal problems.<eos> So, you know, if your friend wants to...<eos> My friend can't talk to you about this.<eos> Nor anyone.
You're sleeping with her?<eos> Who doesn't she have under her spell?<eos> Sir, I cannot take another day of small claims court, okay?<eos> The people in there are petty, they smell bad, and they haven't done anything wrong.<eos> I need hardened criminals.<eos> Man, what I wouldn't give for an arsonist or a serial killer.<eos> Oh, sir, sir, what do I have to do to put this behind me and get back into my court?<eos> You could be proactive.<eos> You could take steps to show the board that you are rectifying your behavior.<eos> My behavior?
- I mean, I am number four, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why does this freak you out?<eos> Because... okay, 'cause my number four was in high school.<eos> Okay, look, I'm not a virgin.<eos> - Yeah, none of us are virgins.<eos> - All right?<eos> I just had a girlfriend for nine years.<eos> You had a relationship for nine years?<eos> With whom?
I know.<eos> These are for what Alexandria can be after this.<eos> Because one way or another, there's gonna be an after this.<eos> Now, when the blade connects, don't jerk it right back. - You'll get stuck.<eos> - Stuck?<eos> Like an ax cutting into a tree.<eos> It's easier to get a blade into bone than out.<eos> So what should we do?<eos> You should slide the machete down through the wound.<eos> One fluid motion.
What?<eos> You think your wife wouldn't have wanted me to kill it?<eos> We can use them to distract them.<eos> There's a helium tank in those shrubs.<eos> More balloons, more string.<eos> It don't mean anything as long as we keep this up.<eos> You know, you scared the hell out of people when we first saw you.<eos> I know.<eos> You scared the hell out of me.<eos> With that beard.
I didn't come in this morning because I didn't want to get you involved in something that you may not want to be involved in.<eos> In a secret.<eos> It's not my wound.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I know you just took care of Judith this morning, but they want some help with the watch points after that thing with Spencer. Could you...?<eos> Oh, yeah, no problem.<eos> Unless you want me to take your shift.<eos> No, I like being up there.<eos> Even with all them outside?
I kissed her, cause it's what the crowd wanted.<eos> How good of a kisser is she?<eos> Pretty good.<eos> It was really, really good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, how's all this gonna work?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I've got lots of ideas.<eos> I could be your midwife.<eos> And your nanny.
You've never trusted me.<eos> Trust has to be earned, Damian.<eos> That works both ways.<eos> Accessing open file on Anton Schott... a. k.a. Dollmaker.<eos> Dollmaker deceased.<eos> Case closed.<eos> If that had been me dead in one of those cages... would you have killed him then?<eos> We have to be better than our baser instincts.<eos> I'm sorry about sneaking out the other night.<eos> And the night before that?
And sometimes the meaning is there.<eos> But sometimes, Master Bruce, terrible things just happen.<eos> No sinister plots.<eos> No secret societies.<eos> They just happen.<eos> I'm sorry, Kory, really, but I'm stuck babysitting.<eos> No, I'm not kidding.<eos> You're wearing what?<eos> The red one?<eos> With the lace?
Immortality.<eos> But only 24 hours at a time.<eos> It certainly beats the alternative.<eos> And when these indestructible warriors rise, you'll be their general... and lead them in a war on Gotham that will reclaim this city for the Court.<eos> After I undergo the ritual that will make me like them?<eos> You'll die, yes... but you'll be reborn as something miraculous.<eos> One man's miracle is another man's damnation.<eos> We've trained you since you were a child... lifted you out of the gutter, and you dare to...<eos> Not a soulless thing, Talon.<eos> A god.
His voice is still in your head.<eos> "Justice, not vengeance."<eos> His voice is wrong.<eos> He's like a father to you, isn't he?<eos> You look up to him.<eos> Far from it.<eos> But, yes, I guess I do look up to him.<eos> I had a Batman in my life.<eos> He was a thief.<eos> A damn good one.
He's like a father to you, isn't he?<eos> You look up to him.<eos> Far from it.<eos> But, yes, I guess I do look up to him.<eos> I had a Batman in my life.<eos> He was a thief.<eos> A damn good one.<eos> And from a very young age, he made certain I was too.<eos> I was his shadow.<eos> His echo.
No, I'm...<eos> I-I didn't call her.<eos> I swear!<eos> Okay.<eos> Justine's been here just shy of a year.<eos> Good tenant, no trouble.<eos> All right.<eos> Nice place.<eos> Guess being a fortune teller is a good gig, huh?<eos> Psychic.
It wasn't done overtly of course.<eos> And I would never do it.<eos> But you don't think I could really kill Justine, do you?<eos> You're the psychic.<eos> I shouldn't have to tell you what I'm thinking.<eos> Avalon?<eos> I thought she was barred from the FBI.<eos> Well, yeah, but she can do her work anywhere.<eos> She's been trying to contact Justine.<eos> Oh, the dead person.
She said she hurt enough people, and that her death was her own fault, poor thing.<eos> Oh, hello, Avalon.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Not in connection to the case, of course, but because I kind of like you.<eos> She contacted Justine.<eos> But Justine won't say who killed her.<eos> She doesn't want to get anybody in trouble.<eos> Gee, fancy that, not having an answer.<eos> I did hear from your friend though.<eos> The psychologist.
[pam] by dressing like a maitre d' on a dinner cruise<eos> For gay republicans?<eos> That's a thing?<eos> [pam] I don't know, but you don't want<eos> Edie dogging you out in front of the entire school.<eos> The entire what?<eos> [pam] rehearsal dinner.<eos> Shut up. Come on, what happened?<eos> Did she dump pig's blood all over you at the prom?<eos> No, not pig's blood.
Is there any chance that your mom signed the house over to you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> She's been running around like crazy, saying she need to get her ducks in a row or... He's a vampire, which means after you fed him your blood...<eos> He died.<eos> Calculator.<eos> Calculator.<eos> Where is the calculator?<eos> Of course.<eos> Under the catatonic serial killer.
I don't know.<eos> That falls under your purview.<eos> A guy comes to me, wants me to help him find his wife, usually he can't stop talking.<eos> Every little detail he thinks might help.<eos> You're saying very little, professor.<eos> We need to know everything.<eos> Even if it's something you don't want to talk about.<eos> 25 years of marriage, things...<eos> She was having an affair.<eos> With a client.
The power to transcend the fourth dimension, to captain the arrow of time.<eos> My machine.<eos> Looks like a fairground ride.<eos> How does it work?<eos> By generating radial geodesic motion, it creates an Einstein-Rosen bridge, by way of a maximally extended extrapolation of the Schwarzschild metric.<eos> Ah.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> The power cells haven't fully powered up yet, so it'll be a short trip.<eos> A quick nip into the future, then back to the present.<eos> With proof.
0.1mg, 0.25mg,<eos> 0.75mg.<eos> What's that?<eos> A whopper of a clue.<eos> So you know who did it?<eos> Not quite.<eos> But you do know how it was done?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> But I think it's something to do with these worms.<eos> Worms, what worms?
And the inspector's already made an arrest.<eos> Ginnie Godden.<eos> That's nonsense!<eos> I'll go talk to him.<eos> I'm glad you said that.<eos> I find it hard to believe that Ginnie's a murderer.<eos> Also, I just came from the cottage hospital.<eos> Little Mary Harris died this morning. - What?<eos> - Another death.<eos> Just this morning.
- Father!<eos> Fancy meeting you here.<eos> Returning lost property.<eos> - What's your excuse?<eos> - Who loses a stick?<eos> More to the point, who blinking' well returns one?<eos> This is not just a stick.<eos> This is a hazel dowsing rod.<eos> It didn't just fall off a tree and where I found it... There are no hazel trees.<eos> Out at the Stones.
Malcolm believes that with purity comes strength.<eos> His chastity allows him to commune with Higher Powers.<eos> The Father found Malcolm's stick out at the Stones.<eos> He could have left it there any time.<eos> Anyone who believes in dowsing wouldn't let their rod out of their sight.<eos> I saw him with this around Kembleford... late yesterday.<eos> Hang about.<eos> So that means it was dropped sometime between... then and this morning, which means that Malcolm could be...<eos> - A witness...<eos> - the killer.
And then I saw child after child die, or live maimed.<eos> I prayed and I prayed, but... if your Christian God won't save them, I want no part of him.<eos> We need to save our children.<eos> That's not quite true of you, Alf, though, is it?<eos> Convenient - get rid of a pregnant girlfriend you were tired of, wasn't it?<eos> And Freddie?<eos> No-one's done anything to Freddie.<eos> Yet.<eos> Mrs. McCarthy was very impressed with Walt's support for Ginnie when she was in custody... promising you'd be with her little boy<eos> "every second of the night and day."
- And what do you think you're playing at?<eos> - Over there with the others!<eos> You, the priest, you're coming with us.<eos> Cowards.<eos> That's what you are.<eos> What did you say?<eos> We didn't fight a war for your sort to go around stealing from innocent people.<eos> There's no need for any trouble.<eos> Shoot a defenceless woman, would you?<eos> Gladly.
Weren't you, Brown?<eos> Is this true, Brown?<eos> Well?<eos> I haven't got time for this.<eos> Mr Redhill...<eos> Where's your tongue, man?<eos> Please, forgive me, My Lord.<eos> He didn't set the world alight, my husband.<eos> But he was a good man.<eos> Honest.

Yes, but you are still a material witness and a suspect in a murder inquiry.<eos> Hardly a master criminal.<eos> But admits to theft.<eos> Well, you saw Jess Chambers.<eos> She seemed keen to avoid us.<eos> Didn't you also think it odd, what he said, that there's no way she's a beginner. Why pretend?<eos> She wanted to be here for some other reason.<eos> Jake, maybe?<eos> - He was an attractive man. - Mmm.<eos> Married, though.
By that measure, many of your clients should be behind bars, should they not?<eos> Perhaps if our killer had incorporated first...<eos> Whoever shot Henry Wilseck wanted to make it about you.<eos> We want to know if you know anyone who would do that, and why.<eos> You're asking if anyone hates me?<eos> The line forms behind this guy.<eos> Well, anyone in particular have reason to cause you trouble?<eos> Aside from our colleague?<eos> I was in a relationship.<eos> With another attorney.
Winston, Winston, Winston,<eos> - Winston, Winston... !<eos> - Yes.<eos> Winnie!<eos> Wow, a lot of city officials around here.<eos> Maybe somebody can help us with our noise problem.<eos> Okay, enough of this by-the-book nonsense.<eos> It's time to play hardball.<eos> - Be a shark, Jess.<eos> Not a dolphin.
All right, all right!<eos> Morning, Jerry.<eos> - Hey, how are you doing?<eos> - How are you doing?<eos> Eh. Different day, same bucket, right?<eos> Is that today's Times?<eos> Kristof's got a piece on net neutrality.<eos> It's very complex, I don't know where I stand.<eos> What kind of bagel do you want this morning?<eos> Uh, poppy seed or sesame?
Okay, We're following his ass right now.<eos> 20 bucks says he leads us straight to his floozy.<eos> Sorry, girls.<eos> The station called.<eos> There's a chance of wind sheer tonight, and they want me there, just in case.<eos> Don't wait up.<eos> There's no such thing as wind sheer... I think.<eos> Well, [bleep], it could still be either of them.<eos> Who do we follow?<eos> Neither.
What if you're going about it all wrong?<eos> Maybe we should be looking for people to enlist. A good samaritan? How can you say that after... everything that happened?<eos> "Everything that happened." Is--<eos> Is that her name now?<eos> You said you didn't want to talk about Ms. Shaw.<eos> Let's talk about the 7.1 billion people out there, Harold.<eos> And the odds that a few of them just might give us an advantage over a runaway artificial intelligence.<eos> What's the Machine proposing?<eos> She wants me to build an app.<eos> For what purpose?
Something tells me she wasn't all that into Trey in the first place.<eos> And as for college...<eos> I think she just dropped out.<eos> Hey, this is amazing.<eos> Your little Miss Mary Jane has aliases connected to over a dozen other criminal cases.<eos> She's been busy.<eos> Some of them were actually girl-next-doors we brought in for questioning, but their alibis checked out.<eos> She stole their identities to commit the crimes.<eos> So what are we dealing with?<eos> Grifter?

Thief?
No, the point is don't date men in the rooms.<eos> Where else am I supposed to meet them?<eos> You told me not to screw around at the restaurant.<eos> No, I told you stop sleeping with your married boss.<eos> That still leaves you all those single dishwashers and busboys.<eos> That's tough; they all live together.<eos> There's plenty of other places to meet nice fellas.<eos> We should all go out together.<eos> Your mom and I can be your wing-gals.<eos> "Wing-gals"?
Why you running?<eos> Why you running, huh?<eos> Can't be seen with no cops.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, why?<eos> What are you afraid of?<eos> All right. Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Put any weight on it?<eos> Not without moaning.
Why not?<eos> Look, Erin, I've been an investigator for the D.A.'s office for almost 12 years-- eight different regimes.<eos> Do you know how I survived?<eos> I know when to lay off.<eos> You and I have been through some wars together, really pushed the envelope, but you need to lay off on this one, too.<eos> The players are just too big.<eos> Which players are those?<eos> The Commissioner for the Department of Corrections.<eos> The D.A. himself.<eos> McCoy?
They know everything about us.<eos> Everything we've ever done wrong.<eos> What did you do?<eos> This isn't like pinching stuff from the shops.<eos> - Why am I here?<eos> - Why are WE here?<eos> Being made to do this? Being threatened?<eos> What have you dragged us into?<eos> How could you do this to us?<eos> To your father?
How do you know?<eos> How?<eos> No! No, no, no!<eos> Stop...<eos> No! No, no, no, no!<eos> Please...<eos> Because he was my spy.<eos> I made him a spy.<eos> I told you, my husband was an important man.<eos> An important man, with a second-rate mind.
And maybe we didn't have time to talk all the time, but he was a good, decent boy.<eos> Sir, I was raised in a single-parent home, and my mother, she was on me about eating my vegetables, getting good grades, but you know what, she was a 5th-grade teacher in Brooklyn and we lived in the Bronx.<eos> There were a lot of things that I got into that she never knew about.<eos> Sometimes, kids keep secrets from the people they love the most.<eos> Is it possible that, maybe, that's what happened here?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Okay, info from narcotics places Miguel's body squarely in Trinitario gang territory.<eos> Did they say if Trinitario is active in the sale of kind bud?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Extremely active.
He looks a little fired up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Now, I'm not gonna let him hurt you too bad.<eos> Great.<eos> But if you're gonna be in this division, I need to know if you can take a punch.<eos> Not bad. He can move.<eos> Celeste hits harder than he does, but he can move.<eos> All right, well, stop jerking around and hit this friggin' kid already, will ya?<eos> My pleasure.
I've never even been up to that damn War Eagle.<eos> How'd you know that was where we found Thorvin's body?<eos> You mean you can't get ahold of Walt, either?<eos> He's not picking up.<eos> Maybe I should try Ferg.<eos> You're not exactly talking in code out here.<eos> Hey, babe, let me get four top-shelf tequilas.<eos> None of that usual watered-down cat piss, okay?<eos> Put it on my tab.<eos> Under what name?
Is this where it happened?<eos> No.<eos> Thorvin Hampton's body was found right down here.<eos> You have any trouble finding this place?<eos> Not really.<eos> I just followed the signs.<eos> You mean these signs.<eos> I took them all down earlier today, but, uh, you remembered how to get here anyway because you've been here before.<eos> In this room.<eos> With your half-uncle.
So you can know the deadline to find out who did this to me.<eos> 14 days is how long Dr. Lin has.<eos> Say it's you.<eos> You got two weeks.<eos> 336 hours.<eos> A little over 20,000 minutes.<eos> Look at you, Rain Man.<eos> Seriously, though, what would you do?<eos> Gather my family.<eos> Mom, brother and sister.
I knew that my Fenestella needed an endless source of power, so I designed a cube which could harness supernatural energy.<eos> Our allies from the Order of the Sacred Heart did the rest.<eos> Franklin choked with envy when he saw it.<eos> - Remarkable.<eos> - So we're talking to a hologram of third president, writer of the Declaration of Independence.<eos> Architect of Monticello.<eos> - Must you?<eos> - Apologies.<eos> So... you are Thomas Jefferson's proxy.<eos> But with the same memories, feelings and personality of the man.
That was you.<eos> I can teach you to control that.<eos> If you allow me in and you come in with us, with me, your eyes and heart and body will open to a truly new world.<eos> How can you hope to build a new world on the corpses of the innocents who live in this one?<eos> There is no world new or old not founded on bones and blood.<eos> Imagine a world free of the violent hypocrisy and oppression of the puritans, a new world that celebrates the power of nature, freedom of thought, belief, and feeling.<eos> This is our chance.<eos> A moment when the future of this land is utterly in doubt.<eos> You and I may have different methods, Anne, but the life you dream of is the very one I'm fighting for.<eos> But at what price?
It's not my first rodeo.<eos> Don't pull a muscle patting yourself on the back, Reagan.<eos> You know, why do you got to be like that, Morgan?<eos> Come on, we're a team now.<eos> Dream on.<eos> I only did this so Rella's brains wouldn't get splattered all over the courthouse steps.<eos> Well, whatever the reason, we owe you one.<eos> Just promise me I'll never have to work with you, your sister, or anybody else named Reagan ever again, and we'll call it square.<eos> Okay, how about Baez?<eos> Her, too.
Officer Butler is less than a year out from retirement, by the way.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Long service?<eos> 22 years.<eos> Long and distinguished.<eos> Good for him.<eos> Less than a year out.<eos> You know how time can drag where budget matters are concerned.<eos> Pensions.<eos> All of that.
What is it?<eos> - It's a campaign Twitter account.<eos> - How do you know about it?<eos> - Of course.<eos> The chatty body woman.<eos> - It's a dormant Twitter account.<eos> - We rarely use it.<eos> - And yet we used it last night.<eos> "4th: 40/43-soft.<eos> - 3rd: 44/44."
Only you and Cary.<eos> Look, I'll look into it as soon as I get back, okay?<eos> Bye.<eos> It's illegal to drive and talk on the phone.<eos> It's a $75 fine.<eos> But it's more with a child in the car.<eos> Should we just try silence for a moment, Dylan?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> A different way.
Does my marriage have to be something you can smell?<eos> (snoring)<eos> You see, Marge?<eos> You see?<eos> The only way you and Homer will ever be happy is to spend a little time apart, followed by more time apart, followed by a divorce.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> What is... What, what's going on?<eos> Wait, no, no, no, I remember.<eos> Happy anniversary.
- Blue.<eos> - It's not a blue, actually.<eos> We should have offered you a blue,<eos> - but in fact that is a...<eos> - Is it a sperm?<eos> - No, sperm are the ones with the big, big...<eos> - Hump.<eos> - It's a humpback.<eos> Oh, sperm's got the big head that fills with stuff.<eos> With spermaceti.
But he just got them from all over the place.<eos> In fact, one of his tallest was a seven-foot Irishman called James Kirkland, who was a hero of the Regiment of Potsdam Giants.<eos> And he paid fathers for tall sons, he paid tall women to have sex with tall men so they could have tall sons. He was, and if he was...<eos> He sounds like my kind of guy, I've got to say.<eos> If he was unhappy, he'd get two or three hundred of his giants...<eos> Ho, ho, don't finish this sentence.<eos> No, no, no. Preceded by tall, turbaned Moors, with cymbals and trumpets of the Grenadiers' mascot, an enormous bear, to march for him to cheer him up.<eos> And they'd do this through his bedroom if he was ill.<eos> - To march for him?<eos> With a bear as well?
But that's a short chap, but chirpy and cheerful and ready to lay down his life for our country.<eos> - I hope he doesn't shake hands with him.<eos> - Hey, now.<eos> That's given my husband and I a whole new avenue for bedroom role-play.<eos> "You be Henry and I'll be a Scots Guard." Yeah!<eos> Well, there you are. So next time you go on a Butlins holiday, you can say,<eos> "Well, thank you, Billy, for putting your life at risk, "despite the fact that you weren't as tall as most soldiers."<eos> And he survived.<eos> He survived, in order to create these holiday camps. Yeah.<eos> - With tiny beds. - With...
Is it searching for extraterrestrial life?<eos> It is searching, but it's searching for something much closer to home<eos> - or, indeed, wider in the universe.<eos> - Parking Space!<eos> PS, "Parking Space."<eos> It's a Great something and the S is a "Search." So it's a Great something something something Search.<eos> - It's using computers.<eos> - Michael Parkinson?<eos> - Since 1996...<eos> Mum Porn.
What?<eos> That-that is crazy.<eos> Liam's the one who wanted me to arrest him.<eos> And apparently, he doesn't want you to get to the Ellingsworths either.<eos> Look, Cat, Liam is smart.<eos> Okay? He clearly has a plan.<eos> He's playing everybody.<eos> Yeah, well, I like to think I'm pretty smart, too.<eos> I'm gonna have a little chat with Helen Ellingsworth.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay.<eos> Okay, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> You're late, Detective.<eos> Uh, right.<eos> Sorry, Lieutenant.<eos> I was just working on a case.<eos> Case?
He was Christian scientist.<eos> But after the war... he wasn't anything.<eos> I would take Andy to church, but Gil said he had no use for those stories.<eos> What he s... what he saw, it stayed with him.<eos> May I have a glass of water?<eos> I just need your keys.<eos> It's an old woman.<eos> Her husband started the business.<eos> She comes in at night to pay bills.<eos> At night?
That's something that my father used to say every morning before he started work.<eos> What did he do?<eos> He was a farmer.<eos> Andy said the farm is a vineyard now.<eos> A vineyard, like in France.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yours?<eos> He was a coal miner.<eos> Your mother?<eos> An office worker.
He's a good... he's a good son.<eos> Nothing's gonna happen to him.<eos> Promise?<eos> I promise.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> Yes.<eos> And this is what you do?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> By yourself?<eos> With my husband.
So I guess you're right, let's just stick with radio.<eos> My man.<eos> - Well, I just think...<eos> - And I appreciate your thoughts.<eos> But...<eos> I have guided Oscar's career for 20 years now and he's doing just fine.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me, I'm late for a meeting and I have more meatball sub on my shirt than I feel is professional.<eos> So you and Teddy have been together for 20 years?<eos> Yeah, I was his first client.<eos> Well, first human.
Yeah.<eos> Well, that's not completely true.<eos> He's the one who wanted me to go on the show.<eos> But I'm the one who did it.<eos> Well, if I had been straight with you and told you the truth years ago, maybe you would've listened to me.<eos> Hey, guys?<eos> I-I can't get the head off!<eos> It's stuck!<eos> You were just being a good agent.<eos> And a good friend.
Yeah, I do know that, but staying locked up in here, sitting on the ground reading the same lore books over and over and over again, it's not helping you.<eos> You need to get back in the game for your own good.<eos> You can beat this, Dean.<eos> Do you really believe that?<eos> Yeah, you're damn right I believe that.<eos> You know, you also believed in the Easter Bunny till you were 12.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Look, I was 11.<eos> And a half.<eos> And a half. Right.
Pretty much.<eos> You see anyone else?<eos> No, sir, Officer.<eos> And what about, uh, a chill?<eos> Or did you smell any rotten eggs?<eos> What?<eos> No, man. Uh...<eos> I smelled flowers, though.<eos> You smelled flowers?<eos> What kind of flowers?
You see anyone else?<eos> No, sir, Officer.<eos> And what about, uh, a chill?<eos> Or did you smell any rotten eggs?<eos> What?<eos> No, man. Uh...<eos> I smelled flowers, though.<eos> You smelled flowers?<eos> What kind of flowers?<eos> Flowery flowers.

Stop the train!<eos> Stop the train!<eos> Stop the train!<eos> Stop the train!<eos> Stop the train!<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Bloody hell!<eos> Stop the train!<eos> What about my town?<eos> What about my people?
Upshifted H and J keys.<eos> You got samples of Balik's handwriting?<eos> This should throw the German off a few years.<eos> While we get closer to the big bomb.<eos> Not the kind of race you want to come in second.<eos> Colour coded.<eos> You've got 'em straight?<eos> If I give Neil the white pill, it's 30 instant minutes of peace and quiet.<eos> Just don't confuse it with the stimulant or he'll never shut up.<eos> - Or with this one.
The man is a stallion.<eos> Good...<eos> I have to join a few friends for dinner.<eos> I was hoping I might persuade you to join me.<eos> I would be honoured.<eos> - Where are they going?<eos> - The officers eat at the Bagatelle, Rue de I'eglise.<eos> I've got to go.<eos> It's the smell, you know?<eos> The gunpowder...
Oh, thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - So many elegant uniforms.<eos> A special occasion?<eos> Just an informal gathering to decide some matters close to the Fuehrer's heart.<eos> The Fuehrer... I had no idea.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> So what do you do, exactly?<eos> More than fill out forms, I'm guessing.<eos> A little more than that, yeah.

- (Aurora): Forget my name.<eos> S01E07 Quislings<eos> One o'clock, on the bench, newspaper.<eos> No handkerchief.<eos> And he should have a suitcase.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yeah, I'm good.<eos> He should be here by now.<eos> Is that him?<eos> With the suitcase?
- I just want to make sure...<eos> - Maybe one day I'll tell you.<eos> We'd better get to work.<eos> All roads are risky.<eos> Security is heightened today, but we have by boat.<eos> - By boat?<eos> - Water is safer than the land.<eos> It's harder for them to control the checkpoints, especially at night.<eos> We have a small fishing vessel waiting for you in an hour.<eos> 7:30 sharp, near the warehouse district.
Putting your fist through the goddamn glass.<eos> Too right.<eos> Stay back.<eos> Wait, wait, don't...<eos> Keep your distance, we stay in pairs.<eos> Is it true?<eos> What he told me?<eos> - Are we nearly there?<eos> - Yes.<eos> In front of the granary warehouse 7.
Speedy, behind you!<eos> Oh! I thought I told you guys to call me Red Arrow.<eos> A Red Arrow just means you can't make a left turn.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I'm inside the hijacked truck.<eos> Canary, you're up.<eos> They've got backup.<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man Anyone manage to get eyes on that stolen cargo?<eos> They look like equipment containers.<eos> Not equipment.

Might I suggest that you avoid them completely?<eos> Would she really be such a threat, even to one like me?<eos> The lady Aurora doesn't need teeth to tear a man's soul out.<eos> One need only stare in her eyes and be lost.<eos> Ah. Oh, Kol...<eos> Kol was a bloody loon.<eos> Loved it.<eos> And Finn... oh, Finn. Finn... Finn was fine as long as you didn't actually have to speak to him.<eos> Have you spoken to her?<eos> Who?
Kol was a bloody loon.<eos> Loved it.<eos> And Finn... oh, Finn. Finn... Finn was fine as long as you didn't actually have to speak to him.<eos> Have you spoken to her?<eos> Who?<eos> Oh, you mean her.<eos> As you well know, Aurora and I parted ways centuries ago.<eos> Please excuse me.<eos> There's someone I need to speak to.<eos> Hmm. Anyone tasty?
I don't trust anyone.<eos> Unh! I thought you said no vamp speed, Marcel.<eos> Come on, Vincent.<eos> If I move any slower, I'll be going in reverse.<eos> Ooh. Fighting angry.<eos> Because they found that second dead body?<eos> You still think it's my guys. Huh?<eos> Don't matter what I think, Marcel.<eos> News breaks there's a killer loose in the quarter, tourism is gonna drop, and who are your vampires gonna feed on then?<eos> Locals?
Davina, I need to see my daughter.<eos> I'm sorry, but there's something I need you to do for me first.<eos> Who's there?<eos> You're on edge.<eos> And you're trespassing.<eos> You can't just come...<eos> I mean, Klaus, seriously.<eos> I didn't come here to quarrel.<eos> I came to offer you a gift, maybe in exchange for one of our little chats of which I'm in particular need, given as my brother doesn't bother to answer my calls, and now my old mate Lucien has swanned into town<eos> with all manner of troubling news.
I just wanted to try some skin-to-skin contact.<eos> What?<eos> Well, it helps babies bond with their dads.<eos> It's, uh, chapter 12 in the book. Oh, right. Yeah.<eos> It was a really cool chapter.<eos> So I should probably go to sleep.<eos> I have to be up in, um... 121 minutes.<eos> (laughs) okay.<eos> Good night.<eos> Night.
It'll knock the wind out of his sails, and the rest of the budget will fly through.<eos> I know it sounds bloodless, but you're not gonna survive your first budget getting decimated in a public hearing.<eos> Ma'am, Jay has a point.<eos> We have to look at the bigger picture.<eos> Is it reasonable to risk the whole budget - for a single program. - (several answer in affirmative)<eos> Yes, it is, please don't give up on this.<eos> - We can win it.<eos> - Can we?<eos> Give me an argument, let me hear it.<eos> Gladly...
Those boys weren't boys.<eos> They were monsters, and they were a threat.<eos> Anybody could have panicked.<eos> Not anybody could have done what you did.<eos> This job is supposed to be saving people.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> It sounds better on paper, doesn't it?<eos> Well, now that you've said your thanks, let's talk about what happens next.<eos> I like it here.<eos> With you.
Trust me.<eos> I can see that working for you, Dwayne, but, you see, I'm not really the action hero type.<eos> If you don't try, you'll never know.<eos> Whoo!<eos> Ah!<eos> You, sir, are a gent and a scholar.<eos> Night-night, Dwayne - and thanks.<eos> I'll see you bright and early, Chief.<eos> Maybe not so bright and maybe not so early.<eos> Cami...
I'm going to get another drink.<eos> Do you want one?<eos> He was just so passionate about everything.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know it was wrong but I just lashed out... just wanted a dad.<eos> Yes, well, you should have told us.<eos> Is there anything else, Ryan?<eos> Anything that can help us find out who did this to your father?<eos> Well, I... I heard Dad arguing on the phone.<eos> Who with?
You're my superior officer.<eos> And a friend.<eos> And as a friend, there's something I need to tell you.<eos> ~ Things have been...<eos> ~ I'm sorry, I... ~ OK, you first.<eos> ~ No, please.<eos> Right.<eos> For the past few days, your attitude, your behaviour.<eos> You've been a little... odd.<eos> Odd?
All right?<eos> I think it's complicated.<eos> What is complicated about my sister dating the guy that tried to kill you?<eos> I think that's pretty simple.<eos> Not everything in life is simple, even if you want it to be.<eos> Morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Grant, do you want me to drop you off?<eos> Taylor, I didn't see him on purpose.<eos> - Who?

Thank you.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> So, tell me why you want to be a Theta?<eos> Well, I want to be a part of the sisterhood.<eos> You don't have to give me the canned answer.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay.
- How were we?<eos> -Amazing!<eos> Thank you, online tech support person man.<eos> - Hello, Josh.<eos> - Gabi.<eos> If you have a computer problem, you can come to me.<eos> You know... the last guy you had sex with.<eos> Were you listening to my private conversation?<eos> Your private conversation that you were having in my kitchen<eos> - with my Internet on my laptop?
I'm outta here.<eos> Cooper, you can't just leave.<eos> You're right.<eos> I spent 13 hours on a plane, paid $800 for this beautiful hotel suite, tried a little something called manscaping... all so we could have this magical night together.<eos> So you know what?<eos> I am gonna stay.<eos> Oh, thank god.<eos> You're leaving.<eos> Leaving?<eos> In shame?
- Because Yolanda is weak.<eos> All Coleman has to do is call her, and she caves.<eos> So we're gonna confront Coleman, make sure he never contacts her again.<eos> Oh, so that's why you brought me.<eos> I'm the bad cop! I'm the muscle!<eos> I'm the heavy!<eos> I'm missing a tassel on my loafer.<eos> Coleman.<eos> - Look, we need to talk man to man.<eos> - To man!
- Sir?<eos> We're going to resolve this matter tonight.<eos> We?<eos> William, do you know what a moral conflict is?<eos> No, sir.<eos> It occurs when one's most deeply held convictions do not match one's actions.<eos> All right.<eos> Prior to my melancholic attack, do you remember what I was doing?<eos> You had just sat down to dinner.<eos> Yes, and just before that?
Same type of drill case.<eos> It's empty.<eos> Damn it!<eos> We're too late.<eos> VIPER75 has the gun.<eos> Well, we know he likes to kills his victims as close as possible to the drop-off location to minimize his contact with the murder weapon.<eos> He should still be in the park.<eos> There's so many people.<eos> Anybody could be the suspect.<eos> a victim.
But okay.<eos> Listen to me. Look. Look, man.<eos> - You got to smarten up, all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Something like this can ruin your career, all right?<eos> Take food off your plate.<eos> - You trying to eat, right?<eos> - Gotta eat, Rick. - Right.<eos> - Here on out, I'm walking a straight fucking line, man.<eos> - Straight and narrow.
Thank you.<eos> You really want to thank me?<eos> Don't put me<eos> I know.<eos> in this position...<eos> Position again.<eos> Heather Drake on one for you.<eos> Mrs. Drake, this is Detective Reagan.<eos> Did they explain to you what's going on down here with your husband?<eos> Ex-husband.
Till he was taken from us too soon, at the age of...<eos> Twenty-three? !<eos> People, for God's sake, join a gym!<eos> Kumiko, would you still love me if I lost weight?<eos> Much more!<eos> Marge, I'm sorry I was proud of myself.<eos> That's not really what I was...<eos> It will never happen again!<eos> Now come on. Let's walk home.<eos> Absolutely.
Oh, did I tell you I'm gonna be doing a lot of abbreve's?<eos> Peter, you sound like an idiot.<eos> And did you put a skateboard in the washing machine?<eos> It's gonna cost several hundred dollars to repair.<eos> How we do, Lois.<eos> All we do.<eos> You ever get in the pocket of a wave?<eos> Peter, you know I haven't.<eos> And I know for a fact that you haven't, either.<eos> In the pocket.
Oh, my God!<eos> Does this mean you're gonna move to Europe to make movies?<eos> How in the world did you not know she was underage?<eos> Well, in retrospect, she did ask a lot of questions about To Kill a Mockingbird.<eos> Should have sent her my way.<eos> I love that book.<eos> Oh, Gregory Peck-- whew!<eos> Anyway, now I gotta go in front of a judge.<eos> Really?<eos> Number one or number two?
But before you do, please know<eos> I had it pretty rough growing up.<eos> My dad was a military man, so he wasn't around much.<eos> And my mom, well, let's just say, she was a little promiscuous.<eos> In fact, I think my problems started the day I was born.<eos> Wah! Wah! Wah!<eos> It's a boy, Mrs. Quagmire.<eos> Oh, that's wonderful!<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Horny.
He's anxious to meet her new Bourbon suitor.<eos> You'll have to reset the meeting; I can't do it tonight.<eos> I went to considerable lengths to get us this meeting.<eos> You'll have to do better than "not tonight."<eos> I have my own principality, Antoine, with needs that concern me and not you.<eos> It concerns me if your principality might get in the way of our family obtaining a kingdom.<eos> You can't have a new kingdom without me as king.<eos> I'd bear that in mind.<eos> I'm looking forward to tasting your vintage, Majesty.<eos> Greatly.
And who knows?<eos> When she finds the strength to truly love again, you may find you're not as free from her as you think.<eos> Louis, come in quickly.<eos> I got your summons.<eos> I was worried.<eos> Francis has had a change of heart.<eos> He's not going to stand in our way.<eos> We have to be discreet, of course, but... - As soon as we go to Scotland... - Well, there's no need to rush our departure now.<eos> We can be cautious.<eos> How cautious?
Thank you.<eos> I'll be over there.<eos> Applying for Social Security.<eos> So where did you go to pastry school, and why aren't you working now?<eos> Manhattan School Of Pastry, and I am working.<eos> I have my own cupcake shop in Brooklyn.<eos> Oh, it's almost over.<eos> This interview?<eos> Great.<eos> No. Not the interview.

"one in the hole"!<eos> No, Bones, it's a "hole in one."<eos> Let's go.<eos> Over here.<eos> Ow. I have some questions for you.<eos> Why are you interrupting my game in the middle of the most important sporting event of my career?<eos> Troy Carter was murdered.<eos> From my understanding, you two weren't exactly friends.<eos> No, of course not-- we were rivals.<eos> Rivals? Yeah.
The fight that you got into with your brother, Troy.<eos> It was a nasty one.<eos> How did you know about that?<eos> There was a witness.<eos> What, did you forget about her?<eos> She gave us a description.<eos> Turns out, a really good one, in fact.<eos> He was an idiot.<eos> I caught him in bed with a kid.<eos> Darla Simms, yeah.
Smart.<eos> Wet the tape down with my saliva until you could slip right out.<eos> No, bite it.<eos> Obviously, bite it.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> Something stinks.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> But I refuse to mask my natural musk with a bunch of chemicals.<eos> Uh, I was talking to Rosa about her "dinner"<eos> with her "parents."
I heard one of the Marshals call you jiggly Jeffords.<eos> What?<eos> Give me another clip.<eos> Now we're talking.<eos> You two are tied, right?<eos> Both:<eos> Yeah. Settle that score.<eos> Jake, what do you say?<eos> Want to go after the Marshals?<eos> And this butt from Homeland?
Well, who for?<eos> Watch.<eos> The car's registered to a Marcus Leyton, address in Burley.<eos> Here's where it gets interesting.<eos> He works at Anaan's Chambers.<eos> Good work.<eos> Go to the Chambers, find out all you can about him.<eos> Helen, you and I will head to Burley.<eos> MORTON: Well, it should be in the airing cupboard, James.<eos> Yeah, with the other clean stuff.
I heard him crying himself to sleep last night.<eos> Your father is the reason all this is happening.<eos> ~ How can you say that?<eos> ~ Your mother lost her way because of him.<eos> Forgot who she was.<eos> ~ That's rubbish.<eos> ~ And the same thing is happening to you.<eos> ~ What?<eos> ~ I saw you just now.<eos> With that boy.
) I thought my credit card rate was steep.<eos> Who does that?<eos> You know, you rob a bank, jewellery store, I can, sort of, understand that but targeting people who don't have anything to begin with, who are so desperate that they have to go to a loan shark ~ and then to squeeze them...<eos> ~ Without ever quite cutting off the revenue stream.<eos> It's... quite a business model.<eos> You think Hargreaves looks in the mirror at night and says, that was a day well spent?<eos> ~ Do you? ~ (SCOFFS)<eos> Not as often as I'd like.<eos> ~ How many more?<eos> ~ Two more after this.
Look, as soon as Doug's out of sight, she hops into a car with some other customer.<eos> This was taken right before she was shot.<eos> It doesn't show the license plate.<eos> Whoever's driving is probably our killer.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> It's too bad we can't see who it is.<eos> We don't need to.<eos> I know exactly who's behind the wheel.<eos> And how exactly do you regard Captain Broderick in the workplace?<eos> Oh, with utmost respect.

After Cameron, he'd want a follower.<eos> You know, someone less challenging.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Worked for me. - (laughs sarcastically)<eos> I'm going with a secretary, Joan Baez type.<eos> You know, kittens on the futon.<eos> - I guess we'll find out. - (laughs)<eos> What, dinner?<eos> With him?
My accountant said everything was in order!<eos> Sir, there's no need to raise your voice.<eos> This is a pretty standard procedure.<eos> If you'll just come down to our branch on Montague, we can get all this straightened out.<eos> You bet your ass we will.<eos> I'll be right there!<eos> Finch, you got a line on After Hours Management?<eos> When it comes to breaking, entering, and hacking, I can only do two at a time.<eos> Finch, that guy Edwards was talking to--<eos> Clyde Barton?
It's got to be.<eos> How did the hacker gain access to Avery's laptop in the first place?<eos> Good question.<eos> The transfer occurred on a Wednesday at 2:34 p.m.<eos> Business hours.<eos> A patient.<eos> Okay, we've got Avery's old address book on here.<eos> On that date and time...<eos> Uh, she was in a session.<eos> With Logan Reeves. Mm-hmm.
- Hi.<eos> Detective Halstead and Lindsay.<eos> Thanks for meeting us.<eos> Adrian Gish's resume said that he went to Kellogg for his MBA.<eos> You're listed as one of three professors on his advisory committee.<eos> We're just hoping you could tell us some more about him.<eos> I remember Adrian.<eos> Anyone who was here at that time does.<eos> Gifted.<eos> In what way?

Here you go.<eos> Are you two following me?<eos> We're just out on patrol, sir.<eos> Nice weather, huh?<eos> Lindsay, Halstead, Gish thinks he spied us.<eos> Got him.<eos> Wait, is he...<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> For the District.<eos> Extra cheese.
Do what he does.<eos> Well, bye, kitties.<eos> And remember, stripping isn't dancing.<eos> And now all I can see is them wearing pasties.<eos> You know what, Max?<eos> We don't need that rich guy to fix our business.<eos> We can do it ourselves.<eos> Our business is in worse shape than two retired guys in a golf cart.<eos> Well, you know what we'd better fix?<eos> Nancy.
Cuff him.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have a right for an attorney. If you can't afford one, one will be appointed for you.<eos> - Do you understand these rights I've explained to you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> All right, Eddie Long, Zachary Hayes.<eos> Zachary Hayes- - Vincent's beast buddy who ruined my reunion and almost exposed us.<eos> Yeah, add him to the "maybe" stack.<eos> Along with Curt Windsor.
Now, what do we do?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?<eos> Now... I gotta track Liam.<eos> Find Catherine before he realizes I'm still alive.<eos> He's gone forever.<eos> It sucks, doesn't it?<eos> That won't take away the suffering, trust me.<eos> Don't touch her!<eos> You came here for me, right?<eos> Not her.
Fingers crossed. (gasps)<eos> JESSIE: So, as a former Tony winner, I feel like I need to give you some pointers of what you're gonna say when you get up there.<eos> I'm not gonna win.<eos> Yes, you are. You are gonna win.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, when you get up there, you stand up straight, you fake humility, you cry only once when you talk about your dads, and you give all the credit to your incredibly talented director.<eos> Well, he is pretty amazing and handsome, and has the best taste in women.<eos> (laughs) Here we are.<eos> You okay? Whew.
Na h-innse gall.<eos> Aye, you don't sound like an islander.<eos> Well, Jamie spent time in France<eos> Fighting with the French army with Ian.<eos> Perhaps that's what's influenced his accent.<eos> Did you, now?<eos> I did some soldiering myself with the French in Austria.<eos> Were you posted in Spain with Ian?<eos> Aye.<eos> Aye, the border mostly.
Did you, now?<eos> I did some soldiering myself with the French in Austria.<eos> Were you posted in Spain with Ian?<eos> Aye.<eos> Aye, the border mostly.<eos> We got separated during a battle.<eos> I thought he'd died on the field. Hmm.<eos> That was silesia in '40.<eos> He spent the next three weeks convalescing in a brothel.<eos> In a hospital.
But the army is still searching for him.<eos> Well, nobody's searching.<eos> Those few soldiers back in the glen were taking MacQuarrie to the sherriff's court in beauly.<eos> This dispatch is calling on the garrison at Fort William to find Jamie.<eos> And if they never read it...<eos> Then they won't know he's escaped.<eos> He won't go back to Lallybroch.<eos> That's the first place they'll look.<eos> No, he'll go north...<eos> Deeper into the Highlands.
They're like birds in the wind.<eos> If one can cage them, they own them.<eos> It's ours.<eos> You're filching it.<eos> You won't be using it again.<eos> What my companion is attempting to say is that it's...<eos> It's a very special song.<eos> That's precisely why we chose to use it.<eos> Delivers the crowds.<eos> Not my taste.
I understand your hesitation.<eos> What I'm asking is daunting.<eos> But I know if the situation were reversed,<eos> Jamie would come for every single one of you.<eos> The same MacKenzie blood runs through all your veins.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Laddie, stop your nonsense and get back behind me.<eos> Ye're too green to ken what you're saying.<eos> Jamie's always looked after me, protected me.<eos> On the road, Leoch.
We've been friends for years, but I didn't know what it'd be like to live with him.<eos> I'm starting to think I made a mistake.<eos> Gazpacho time!<eos> A horrible, horrible mistake.<eos> Dig in, boys.<eos> It's a vegan feast.<eos> Try one of the meat-free chicken wings.<eos> If a chicken had no meat, it would just fall down to the ground.<eos> There's no meat in any of this?<eos> Not even the meatballs?
- Wonderful. Thank you, Mr.<eos> - President.<eos> As a vocal proponent for the Sexual Assault Bill last session, are you concerned about your relationship with the U.S. military?<eos> No, I'm not, Senator.<eos> I worked closely with the Joint Chiefs on that bill.<eos> What if there were a peacekeeping mission in say, Burma, to quell civil unrest, and the United Nations asked us to contribute troops to put our servicemen and women's lives in peril.<eos> Well, if you're using Myanmar as a hypothetical, I think we're a long way from that, but as Ambassador, I...<eos> My question concerns the use of U.S. military.<eos> The U.S. military is irrelevant.<eos> The current situation in Myanmar...
All right? So, this is us, right now.<eos> And down there, at the end, that's the election.<eos> Now, if I did run, I'd spend the next few months fundraising.<eos> And then somewhere around here, I'd formally announce.<eos> And then even if I did win the nomination, say, somewhere around here, I'd start to have to face off with a Republican challenger, probably Mendoza.<eos> And then things would get brutal.<eos> Daily, daily events.<eos> Fending off attacks, launching my own.<eos> And you're right.<eos> In the end,
I have a gift for you.<eos> I'm sorry for the delay.<eos> I hope we didn't keep you waiting too long.<eos> Shall we?<eos> This was handmade by Tomas Vu, a very talented American artist.<eos> He laser-etches images on one side, and on the other side...<eos> - he puts Beatles lyrics.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Hm.<eos> Back in the USSR.
Come with me.<eos> - We'll be right down, Calista.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> What if I get you transferred?<eos> To some other agency.<eos> It doesn't matter who I work for.<eos> He'll find a way.<eos> How much do you care about staying here?<eos> - What, DC?<eos> - In this country.
Hi.<eos> - Of course. Max.<eos> Hi.<eos> - You're new.<eos> - It was my first time, actually.<eos> - Do you live around here?<eos> - Towson.<eos> Just drove up.<eos> How did you find out about us?<eos> Online.
- Of course. Max.<eos> Hi.<eos> - You're new.<eos> - It was my first time, actually.<eos> - Do you live around here?<eos> - Towson.<eos> Just drove up.<eos> How did you find out about us?<eos> Online.<eos> Website.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Still riding the Bonneville?<eos> Sold the '67 for a Pipeburn.<eos> Beautiful bike.<eos> You should take me for a spin sometime.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> They're a death wish.<eos> At least you know you have a place in heaven.<eos> What's on your mind, Mr. President?<eos> The burial the other day.
Okay?<eos> And it is a beautiful vision.<eos> Don't ruin the vision.<eos> Okay, we can check out the East Bay.<eos> Haven't looked at Oakland yet, you know.<eos> You're all right?<eos> You're starting to feel it?<eos> No.<eos> Just thinking.<eos> About what?
You know there's a legend for a storm like this.<eos> Dad, please don't turn a three-hour traffic jam into an educational experience.<eos> He's talking about The Wild Hunt.<eos> About the Ghost Riders.<eos> Imagine a night like this, Kira.<eos> In storm clouds just like these, phantom hunters would appear.<eos> Riding black horses with blood-red eyes.<eos> And wolves and hounds at their side, baying and snarling.<eos> What were they hunting?<eos> Souls.
'Welcome to Mayor Rostagno's new hospital. Shame'<eos> 'Private property.<eos> Do not enter'<eos> He's healing well.<eos> I don't need to see her anymore.<eos> Physically she's fine.<eos> Now psychologist Schiller will take care of her.<eos> Paola.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> About what?

Just because we don't sound nice, that doesn't mean we don't love each other.<eos> But no matter what, the three of us... we are a family.<eos> Nothing is gonna change that.<eos> Promise?<eos> Double promise.<eos> Did you bring me back something from Mali?<eos> Did you think I'd forget?<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, where would I have put it?<eos> That one.
Look at you.<eos> Big job at defense.<eos> You're making this personal.<eos> You never liked me.<eos> That was always clear. Because guys like you, you're always looking for that climb.<eos> I was a good agent, Alex.<eos> But that wasn't good enough for you.<eos> Well, I wasn't after your job, if that's what you thought.<eos> I wasn't worried about you taking my job.<eos> Then what?
I mean, who goes first?<eos> Do I hand over the pills first?<eos> Or do they give me the money and then I hand over the pills?<eos> I mean, I guess it makes sense if we just exchanged... at the same time, right?<eos> I mean, that's fair.<eos> Maybe we just count to three.<eos> Probably the less talk, the better.<eos> Right. Yeah.<eos> I suppose you could really overthink something like this.<eos> Yeah. - Well, in any case...
Was it in?<eos> Did it go in?<eos> - Yeah. - My point?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, it went in.<eos> Your point.<eos> - Okay, cool. And that confidence gave him a huge burst of energy.<eos> It looks like Aaron's having some fun with the line judge out there.<eos> But others suspected that burst of energy was from something much more illicit than confidence.<eos> It was pretty obvious that he had hidden cocaine in his water bottles... and in his rackets... and in his coke necklace.<eos> And even on the lines of the court.
What?<eos> Don't listen to the redhead!<eos> It's too dangerous!<eos> Moneyball, here I go.<eos> He's gonna make it!<eos> He's totally gonna make it!<eos> No, he didn't make it.<eos> That was intense!<eos> If you would have pulled off the Moneyball, I would have headlined it in the school blog.<eos> Front page.
If defending free speech is controversial, then... we're no better than Russia.<eos> I wish that there were more people in our government defending it.<eos> Are you talking specifically about the Underwood Administration?<eos> I think the president could do more.<eos> You know, the White House has said hat they've been speaking directly with the Kremlin, that they, and I quote here:<eos> "Have to tackle this issue as it relates to the larger diplomatic relationship between the two nations."<eos> Then why haven't we seen any evidence of those talks?<eos> When I'm president, the American people can rest assured that I will take my oath to defend and protect our citizens seriously.<eos> - What do you think of her?<eos> - What, Dunbar?
This is a conversation.<eos> And it's a conversation that never happened.<eos> I took the back door in, I'll take the back door out.<eos> We keep you off the payroll this quarter.<eos> You start officially September 30th.<eos> Next quarter's FEC filings. It's fine.<eos> What are you thinking in terms of salary?<eos> Twenty-two thousand per quarter.<eos> That's way below what I'm worth.<eos> Even in this state.
So pass your law, I'll veto it.<eos> And when you overrule me in the Senate, we'll let the third branch decide.<eos> Don't declare war on Congress, Mr. President.<eos> Not on Congress. I'm declaring war on atrophy.<eos> But these days, who could tell the difference?<eos> - So how about this? - Hm?<eos> I'll order a pizza.<eos> When it gets here, I bring it into this room... with a paper towel draped over my arm.<eos> Voilà.<eos> Just like... room service.
Well, because I've seen what it does to a carotid artery.<eos> - And you're not my kids. - Mm...<eos> Do you think they like me?<eos> They adore you.<eos> Matt asked if you could teach him how to drive.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He says you'd be less judgmental.<eos> Do you want to get married?<eos> To you, or in general?
One point on the ad-buy.<eos> No points.<eos> But I'll do a hundred thousand win bonus if we get the nomination.<eos> I hope I came over here for some good news.<eos> I'm in.<eos> You can tell the president.<eos> August 19th.<eos> We wanted you to announce a lot earlier than that.<eos> No, not the announcement.<eos> This.
- Gay?<eos> - An activist.<eos> I'm sure you got a briefing from the FBI.<eos> Yes, but I would like to hear it from you.<eos> A friend of mine, and this is in the early '90s, she invited me to go with her to a community organizing meeting.<eos> I had nothing better to do, so I said okay.<eos> We get there and there's maybe 12 people in the room, tops.<eos> It was pretty sad, actually.<eos> And the guy speaking is talking about garbage.<eos> - Garbage?

- What the heck?<eos> - No.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> - Whoever it is, don't let them in.<eos> It's us, honey.<eos> Me and Jason.<eos> "Jason and I." Apparently, Amanda never went to high school.<eos> We're here just to give you a hug and make sure you're okay.<eos> Not okay!

I won't be able to join you.<eos> I gotta get on the road to California.<eos> I got a job through Linkedln.<eos> What?<eos> That's crazy!<eos> People use Linkedln?<eos> No, Linkedln hired me to help figure out why people don't use it.<eos> Also, I have an old lady friend I went to high school with who just became un-married last week and I thought I'd look her up.<eos> Wow, you work fast.<eos> Or actually, very slow.
I don't even like Mark.<eos> He has HPV.<eos> He has HPV?<eos> I mean, the disease itself isn't that big a deal.<eos> It's just kinda crazy he has it when he's 14.<eos> He had sex with a girl in Poland.<eos> Like, a Polish girl?<eos> Like, a girl from Long Island who was on his team tour.<eos> Oh, my God, where did they do it?<eos> Like, the hotel?
Yeah.<eos> Uh, I can't do that.<eos> Okay, can you explain why you can't do it?<eos> Is it, like, a scheduling issue?<eos> Or...<eos> Yeah, look, um, you're a very smart and, uh, unusual person, and I like talking with you very much.<eos> - Ditto.<eos> - Cool.<eos> But I'm just trying to, you know, not be so attracted to drama.<eos> Uh, on the whole.
Yeah. I ordered a pizza.<eos> It's kind of cold now.<eos> I thought you'd be back a couple hours ago.<eos> - I can go heat it up in the lounge microwave.<eos> - No, no, it's cool.<eos> Another trip to the cougar cage? No.<eos> No, the physics lab.<eos> My phonon spectra of crystals project is due Friday.<eos> Does she make you happy, or is it just about the sex?<eos> Just the sex, mostly.
Wait, why are you smiling?<eos> 'Cause you were right.<eos> A-About me hiding in here and not being proactive.<eos> But when you left yesterday, I had an epiphany and I heard a voice.<eos> You-you found a student?<eos> Not exactly, but I heard him.<eos> At least I think it's a him.<eos> Well, let's not label or judge.<eos> The point is, is that you were right.<eos> About everything.
- What are you doing?<eos> Where is she?<eos> I know she's here.<eos> - What the hell you doing?<eos> - Hi, Luke.<eos> You lost your damn mind?<eos> What's got into you?<eos> Just couldn't leave her alone, could you?<eos> Always had to be right there, devil on her shoulder, judging her, making her doubt herself.<eos> Oh, my God.
No, Micah's been through enough.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Y... you came by 'cause you were upset about something.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, i... it's, uh... it's nothing, really.<eos> No, come on, man. Come on.<eos> It'd be good to focus on somebody else's problems.<eos> Lay it on me.<eos> Well, uh, I was... I was upset about a chair.<eos> - A chair?
- No.<eos> Anything's better than this.<eos> I'm gonna pretend that's a compliment.<eos> I just mean I'm happy for the distraction.<eos> So, what do you got for me?<eos> Sea salt caramels. Ahh...<eos> Ahh...<eos> I meant professionally, but thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Professionally, well...

Your plan sucks.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I'm not a traditional artist, okay?<eos> So you can't sell me like one.<eos> I know that Rayna thought that I was a joke when I showed up in her office, but my music changed her mind, and I think that it can do the same for everyone else.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm not happy you did it without consulting me, but I can't argue with the results.<eos> A blogger in east Nashville posted about your song.<eos> There've been 3,000 downloads in the last 24 hours.<eos> Really?
I was there pretty much all day.<eos> That's when I bumped into Luke.<eos> We just Sorta ran into each other, and, uh, she was able to help me out with one of my songs.<eos> He wanted to thank me so...<eos> afterwards we went to the cafe.<eos> Pie and coffee, least I could do.<eos> So how long were you in the diner?<eos> A few hours, if you can believe that.<eos> We just got to talkin' about music and life...<eos> Past relationships.
- Come here.<eos> Why in the world is Sadie calling me at this hour?<eos> Hey, girl, what's goin' on?<eos> Rayna, I'm so sorry to be callin' you.<eos> That's okay.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> - I'm in trouble.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - The police station.
You'd just talk me into staying', and I need to get right with myself.<eos> And I need to do that on my own.<eos> You take care of yourself, and... and I'll see you when you get back, okay?<eos> Thank you... for everything.<eos> Thank you, too.<eos> Two nights in a row you haul me in here...<eos> Have a seat.

[Chuckles, gasps] Kitty Wells' guitar.<eos> I should learn to play.<eos> What, you're a Kitty Wells fan?<eos> Uh, not many people know this, but I'm a big country-music geek.<eos> Kitty paved the way for patsy, who paved the way for Loretta, who's pretty much a goddess to me.<eos> She is a class act.<eos> Speaking of classy, look at that.<eos> Come on... I want to show you why I really asked you to the Country Music Hall of Fame.<eos> And museum.<eos> [Laughing] Oh, man.

Why are you calling me?<eos> - Because I feel terrible.<eos> They're coming for you, Teddy.<eos> It's only a matter of time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I hope you can forgive me.<eos> Man: Oh, my gosh. [Laughs]<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> I can't believe I'm here.<eos> Oh, my god.
- that'd be a big help.<eos> - All right, that's great.<eos> Then, I'll, uh, see you later.<eos> [Indistinct conversations] Seriously?<eos> I was just here.<eos> Tiny!<eos> Come on. [Laughs]<eos> I'm sorry. He's... he's new.<eos> Well, uh, so am I, I guess.<eos> Oh, my god.
Wonderful.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm going to tweet this.<eos> Uh, sweetie, no.<eos> Um, actually, you're not.<eos> What happens in Jade's house, stays at Jade's house.<eos> You know, it's important to control your public image.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Anyway...

"Meanwhile, tributes continue to pour in for Sergeant Honeywell.<eos> "Police have said that the 24-year-old<eos> "was an outstanding young officer<eos> "who would be greatly missed by his colleagues."<eos> Sam's phone log.<eos> Message transcripts.<eos> Anything for us?<eos> Just personal.<eos> ~ Bit early, isn't it?<eos> ~ All right.
It just boiled up.<eos> ~ Must have been out of your mind, pouring that... ~ Katie!<eos> Katie!<eos> Katie!<eos> I'm sorry, Katie!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Katie, I'm sorry, Katie!<eos> It wasn't me!<eos> Oi.<eos> ~ You all right?
Nothing like that on the SOC photos though.<eos> I'll check Honeywell's car again.<eos> I was going to suggest lunch.<eos> Honeywell ordered a pizza that night.<eos> Kate Parry says he left without eating it.<eos> And you've found what?<eos> Salad?<eos> Fish?<eos> ~ Must have had that later.<eos> Somewhere else.
Why?<eos> Who wants to know my business, mate.<eos> You got me wrong.<eos> I'll stay out of your way, OK?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> You will, cos otherwise...<eos> Pow.<eos> Tess.<eos> Tess, hey.<eos> ~ You OK?
Everything that I have done, I've done for you and your mum.<eos> Trust me, Tess.<eos> Just, please.<eos> I loved him.<eos> I really loved him.<eos> I know you did.<eos> I know you did.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Pub.<eos> Pubs...
I'm getting everybody together to announce I have an STD.<eos> - I'll text Lip.<eos> - You're acting weird.<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> - Just another of life's little speed bumps.<eos> Nothing a Gallagher can't handle.<eos> - You're not a Gallagher.<eos> - In name, no. Genetics, yes.<eos> - Where's Dad?<eos> - Couch.
- A few.<eos> I think by "helping out," Rasheed meant mopping the toilets and picking up towels. Judging by the ass-kicking I saved you from, I'm not the one in need of moves.<eos> So teach me one.<eos> There's something special about you, Frank.<eos> There are others that got David's parts, but somehow I feel like you got his soul.<eos> - Heh. What?<eos> - That's David's seat.<eos> How did you know to sit there?<eos> No one's sat there since he was shot.<eos> - In the house?

Oh, Harvard, why are you wearing a turtleneck?<eos> Because I know that you hate them, and now that we're no longer in a relationship, I can do whatever I want.<eos> First of all, we were never in a relationship.<eos> Second of all, I told you not to wear turtlenecks because it's 100 degrees down here.<eos> Well, that's the price of freedom... 1,000 hot hands grabbing at my throat.<eos> Harvard, instead of worrying about what I think, maybe you should try and move on, you know?<eos> You're a great guy.<eos> You should put yourself out there, meet people.<eos> Where do you... where do you go to meet people?<eos> Work.
Harvard, come on.<eos> You can still do this.<eos> I've tried.<eos> The most I can do is get it to look surprised.<eos> No, we need to make you a profile that's gonna attract a woman.<eos> Give me this.<eos> Okay.<eos> This picture that... that Derrick took of you... it's a little person-of-interest-y.<eos> Yeah, like in a good way.<eos> No. Not in a good way.
- No, of course I do.<eos> - I'm such a dork!<eos> - Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.<eos> - Marcos: No, it's beautiful.<eos> - Congratulations. - Desi:<eos> Thank you.<eos> Marnie:<eos> Thank you. We're so happy.<eos> Marriage is such an antiquated concept on so many levels, but until they discover something better, you know, this is really the only way I know how to express my eternal devotion to Marnie.<eos> Marnie: Oh, my God.
Bryce is having one of his famous, crazy, weird parties.<eos> I think he has, like, half of the cast of the Cirque du Soleil... um, I can't remember... the sexy one.<eos> Anyway, it's gonna be really great.<eos> - Hey, I have to tell you something.<eos> - Mm-hmm?<eos> Um... I got a job.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's so cool.<eos> - Yeah, um... in Japan.
Has that actually happened?<eos> What if you said it?<eos> Would you turn to stone?<eos> I've never tried.<eos> Very wise.<eos> Look, now that I've proved myself to you, will you let me go?<eos> No.<eos> All you've proved is that you belong in the Temple of Gaia.<eos> Poaching?<eos> In my woods?
What does it do?<eos> No one knows.<eos> Then why do you care?<eos> Because it's extraordinarily powerful.<eos> But what good is that if you don't know what it does?<eos> I, like everyone else on this Earth, would like to find out.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To look for the ring.<eos> Where?<eos> In the forest of Troezen.
There's nobody here but us.<eos> Aren't you at least a little curious?<eos> There's nothing wrong with seeing what it feels like.<eos> Prince Lykos.<eos> The military council of Athens offer you this ritual honour. A sacrifice to celebrate our great victory, as thanks to the holy father, Ares, god of war.<eos> Strike clean. Strike at the heart.<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> Did he lose his nerve?<eos> No, I don't think that's it.<eos> What then?
"botched fuse" system once he came to Portland.<eos> Well, he had, until now.<eos> Which is why the development is so surprising.<eos> Jugs and flares point to our fire artist, Norburg, but she was in custody when the last fire was set.<eos> Where's a picture of this newfangleduse" system?<eos> Uh, no, I don't have one.<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> Has anyone?<eos> Only in the arson-investigator reports.<eos> Only in diagram.

I guess I just want to live in New York.<eos> I want to be a translator at the UN.<eos> Yolanda's father is a diplomat.<eos> I'm so tired of people asking me what I want to do. Well, if you're lucky enough to think of it, you should write it down.<eos> Because when you get older, you're gonna forget.<eos> Did you write down advertising?<eos> I didn't know what advertising was. But I wanted to be in New York City, too.<eos> So, where do you live, Don?<eos> Where do I live? The Upper East Side.<eos> In a penthouse?
Forgot about that.<eos> No one forgets their birthday.<eos> I'm not trying to remember mine.<eos> Same thing.<eos> How did you find out about me?<eos> Celeste.<eos> She e-mailed me.<eos> What did they charge you with?<eos> A bunch of stuff.<eos> For murder.
- Yeah, that's my plan.<eos> In case it's, like, right on the end...<eos> You know what I'm talking about?<eos> - Wait.<eos> - Hello, ladies.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Lyla, what are you doing here?<eos> Well, Abby mentioned it.<eos> Last one in the car is a rotten friend.<eos> Oh, my God.
- That's not working.<eos> - See?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> "Abby McCarthy is a lying, slutty, old hag who needs Botox."<eos> Doesn't even make sense.<eos> How can you be "a slutty, old hag"?<eos> No one would want to sleep with you.<eos> That's your takeaway from that.<eos> - Well, actually--
- Four hibiscus margaritas coming up.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I really do want a lemon water with the cayenne.<eos> Abby, darling, I am not gonna get you that.<eos> You created this monster.<eos> I didn't mean for this weekend.<eos> Hey, Delia, look, drinks are coming to us.<eos> Are those girls wearing wigs?<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> - Chardonnay or Pinot?
- Hmm? - You're a charlatan.<eos> You're not real.<eos> You're not English.<eos> That's a fake accent.<eos> I see it, the words.<eos> Am I not real, Jake?<eos> No.<eos> There's something fraudulent in your life.<eos> Are you ready to face it?<eos> In mine?
Oh, he just wants to see him.<eos> Well, that is never going to happen.<eos> You can tell him so.<eos> ~ Roger...<eos> ~ This is the result of your meddling.<eos> I cannot believe you let that man see Ernest at your house.<eos> Why do you always see everything in black and white?<eos> Right or wrong?<eos> In this instance, I'm in the right.<eos> Oh, in every instance.
Previously on "Lost Girl"... Couldn't help but notice you didn't let her in on your little situation.<eos> Why didn't you turn me fae when you had the chance.<eos> Because I wanted to test the serum.<eos> On who?
- What if this is part of it?<eos> - Then I'll be one step ahead.<eos> Look, I know this is overwhelming for you. But this is a step in the right direction, Bo.<eos> - The forever direction...<eos> - You can't trust him.<eos> It feels like the issue here is that you don't trust me.<eos> (Knock on the door)<eos> That would be the pizza.<eos> Don't fail me.<eos> Sundown.
Mozart, Pavarotti,<eos> Nougaro!<eos> I hate Nougaro! I loathe Nougaro!<eos> I like living singers 'cos you don't!<eos> I like soccer 'cos you don't! I like TV 'cos you don't!<eos> I like everything you hate and hate everything you like!<eos> 'Cos you've been pissing me off for 35 years, Max!<eos> You piss me off!<eos> You're a pain in the ass!<eos> In the fucking ass!
- Swear you didn't know-v.<eos> - How could I know-v?<eos> - He could've told you.<eos> - Me?<eos> Why not?<eos> On everything I hold dear, whatever that is, I swear I know nothing.<eos> I'm the last person Simon would tell. Think for a second.<eos> - 'Jkmat now?<eos> - I need to talk to him!<eos> - What about?
Look, I'll be straight with you.<eos> Feelings about ex-servicemen are running high, and working women.<eos> She was just walking home.<eos> The best thing you can do is get a picture of the real Kitty out there, before people can muddy the waters.<eos> You'd be doing her a big favor - trust me.<eos> In my opinion, there's no better man for the job.<eos> Oh, you're very kind.<eos> One wonders, of course, what the chief is really looking for, and who else is applying.<eos> You're not tempted?<eos> Not at my age!

Thanks for coming.<eos> How are you?<eos> Ah. Gentlemen, shall we? Follow me.<eos> Please, take a seat.<eos> Anywhere.<eos> I am very grateful to those of you who are here.<eos> A few felt unable to attend.<eos> I know why, and I understand.<eos> I want to apologise... .. to you and... to the soldiers that I have let down... .. when I put profits over their wellbeing.<eos> Their lives, Loxley.
I may be young, but my experience is unique.<eos> And knowing how the store works is only half of it.<eos> You need someone who understands you.<eos> Do you remember how mad Ma was at me, when I left school to come and work here?<eos> She wasn't just mad at YOU.<eos> Well, it was a risk, but... I was right.<eos> I can manage things when you're busy with this estate.<eos> I understand how important it is to you, to the family.<eos> Ma would be proud of it and happy to see me take my place here...<eos> .. by your side.
I'll get you your money.<eos> Hello, Henri.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You should be at work.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> It's too late.<eos> When we argued in the window, I could have done anything - even hurt you.<eos> You must not be with me.<eos> We made a vow.<eos> In sickness and in health.
- The family?<eos> The show, your family, the way you care for each other the security...<eos> It will be incredibly important when we move forward.<eos> You must always be able to come home, that's it.<eos> Cheers again!<eos> - Cheers, Dad!<eos> - Cheers, Felicia.<eos> And congratulations!<eos> - Are you as talented?<eos> - In music?
I fully understand what you mean.<eos> Fine.<eos> Jesus Christ...<eos> Nothing we say here will ever leave this room.<eos> Are we on the same page there?<eos> What is it that you want to know?<eos> You're dirty on the outside, but completely pure inside.<eos> I'm the other way around. Pure on the outside, but so fucking dirty inside.<eos> - Will you tell me about them?<eos> - That one?
Forget it.<eos> Wait.<eos> Cash for what?<eos> A plane ticket to go and see Paige over spring break.<eos> My mom won't even let me touch my college savings.<eos> Meanwhile, every day that goes by, Paige and I, we're growing further apart.<eos> Last time we spoke, I even mentioned looking into a liberal arts school in Oregon...<eos> Em, can we not do this now?<eos> I can't talk about this.<eos> Paige and me?

Pistol whip a midget?<eos> -(Clears throat) -Wait. Jimmy, come back.<eos> I gotta check your vagina for sand.<eos> Did you get a look at that door?<eos> It was locked before one of the nosepicks broke it down.<eos> -Okay? -So did you get a look at the hardware? It has to be locked from the inside or the outside.<eos> Are you sure the suspect's not still on the premises?<eos> I confess.<eos> Gladner still got his keys on him?<eos> -They're on his belt chain.
We want to set people up for success.<eos> Vocational training, legitimate career paths.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> How was Gaffney?<eos> Do we have a time set for Ambassador Caspi yet?<eos> Her office is stalling.<eos> Get her schedule.<eos> We'll go wherever she is.<eos> I think she'll be at the cocktail reception tonight<eos> - at the Mexican Consulate.
- I'll call and find out.<eos> What's that?<eos> It came in for you this morning.<eos> Francis?<eos> John Pasternak.<eos> Michael Corrigan's husband.<eos> The latest pile of interview requests is on your desk, most of them Corrigan related.<eos> And GLAAD wants you to be a keynote speaker at their Media Awards Ceremony.<eos> How did he know?<eos> About your vows?
It's impossible to follow the rules.<eos> Another time.<eos> It's too much like my real life.<eos> Besides, we shouldn't be playing games.<eos> You should be asking me questions.<eos> You're getting me drunk.<eos> - I won't remember what I asked. - Mm...<eos> The last time I got this drunk, I broke into a library.<eos> - In Charleston, my alma mater. - Hm...<eos> The Sentinel.
Robert, what's the latest on the omnibus?<eos> The legislation should go to the floor in the next couple of months.<eos> The leadership is pushing...<eos> Set up calls with both Lockheed and Northrop.<eos> We'll pay people to get trained and call it a job.<eos> It isn't a job unless the union says it is.<eos> Well, one step at a time.<eos> You set up the training and I'll speak to the AFL.<eos> Are the AARP here?<eos> In the lobby.
Yes, and I've gone out of my way to put that fight behind us.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Like with Thomas?<eos> When you screamed at us for waking you up.<eos> - I didn't scream.<eos> - It was embarrassing.<eos> Who cares what he thinks?<eos> He was our guest and you walked in there like...<eos> I think you're searching for things that aren't there and ignoring the things that are, like this photograph flinching nonsense.<eos> Oh, Jesus.
But the park near my house here in Washington has never been cleaner.<eos> The dry cleaners I go to just hired two new people this month.<eos> The daycare I drop my kids off at doubled their staff so the children can get more individual attention.<eos> The president may have overstepped in taking FEMA money, but when something works, it works. And America Works works.<eos> Hello.<eos> Promise the money.<eos> Whatever you need to turn him around.<eos> I'll approve the USAID funds.<eos> What made you change your mind?<eos> Today... at the memorial.
So, what'd he tell you in front of the house?<eos> Mm... Nothing much.<eos> Well, it looked intense, whatever it was.<eos> See?<eos> This is why I don't ride in the van.<eos> You did this time.<eos> Sometimes you just need to leave someone alone.<eos> All right, I got the hint.<eos> I meant him.<eos> Not me.
Like what?<eos> The true north festival?<eos> - The apple butter parade?<eos> Hey, I don't mean to butt in here, but I will not stand idly by, while you trash talk the apple butter parade.<eos> Bruce, everybody, can we just please give Cassie a break?<eos> Whose side are you on, really, Adam?<eos> Wipe that smile off your face.<eos> You think you're the only one who's had a little excitement?<eos> Well, let me tell you, I have had my share<eos> - of excitement.
...That's my jawbone.<eos> - Yeah. - Oh, so defiant.<eos> Slow it down, slow it way down.<eos> Slow it way down.<eos> ...Uh... okay...<eos> Oh, my god, your lips.<eos> - My lips?<eos> - They're so soft.<eos> What do you put on them?<eos> Uh, well, wine. Wine, mostly.
We're going to bang.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I'm offering you farm-fresh, free range, grade a pussy here.<eos> Yeah, you don't have to do that. I'm fine.<eos> Fine?<eos> What... what is this? What is this?<eos> What's your deal? Are you not attracted to me?<eos> You're okay.<eos> I'm sorry, what sort of bar are we comparing me to, porn stars?<eos> - Mostly, yeah.
I was born the wrong colour.<eos> An issue you may be familiar with.<eos> Nothing I can't handle.<eos> We were ordered to destroy a village, kill every man, woman and child.<eos> Loyal Moors, like me, innocent people, whose only crime was their race.<eos> I refused.<eos> Baltasar didn't.<eos> That was when I understood what type of man he really was.<eos> It would be helpful if we could see the cipher machine.<eos> At the square.
To risk everything, put it all on the line.<eos> How else do I know I'm truly alive?<eos> You know what really hurts, Athos?<eos> You never once tried to find out what happened to me.<eos> I suppose I thought you'd left town - married.<eos> My father's debts, no land, no dowry, and the taint of what had happened - eligible men found me undesirable.<eos> They were wrong.<eos> Perhaps when I sign over the land to you...<eos> I forgot. I haven't told you my plans.<eos> To your stations!
It's not like I got a normal childhood.<eos> I spent my 14th birthday in the back of a grip truck - with a bunch of teamsters.<eos> - Hey, hey, no.<eos> No apologizing.<eos> I love that watch.<eos> I like it for myself.<eos> - Can I wear it?<eos> - Oh, sure, anytime.<eos> Can we make it into a necklace?<eos> - Or, like, a choker?
Please close the door.<eos> How's your whore?<eos> Is she well?<eos> Junia is very well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And how's your new apartment?<eos> Tiny and awful, I trust?<eos> Actually, that's why I'm here.<eos> I want you to buy me a big, nice one with a view like yours for me and the children.<eos> Preferably on the Upper East Side.
What is that?<eos> Apparently, it's the actual amount of steel that was delivered to the new Knick on March 4, 1901.<eos> I'm assuming that somewhere in this building there's a document claiming that the delivery was much greater, as was the amount that you required the hospital to pay for it.<eos> We'll both just suppose we know where the extra money went.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> You keep excellent records, Herman.<eos> And you were very smart to keep them out of the hospital where people could find them.<eos> Unfortunately, when I went to the bank the other day to retrieve jewelry from my safe-deposit box to sell it, the banker mistakenly gave me the keys to the other Barrow box.<eos> Where are they now, the papers?<eos> In a new safe-deposit box.
Wonderful.<eos> What Edwards and other people of his kind cannot accept is there is great validity in the eugenics movement.<eos> States such as California and Indiana are already seeing the benefits of a purified society and are considering writing it into their legislation.<eos> This movement is growing faster than any other in modern medicine.<eos> But men like Edwards likely also buried their heads when other revolutions arose like germ theory, vaccinations, things that proved over time to be miracles.<eos> Now, if the board sees fit to prevent me from practicing in New York, there are hundreds of other institutions and doctors whom I'm sure would welcome me.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Gallinger.<eos> Dr. Edwards, how much have you studied the eugenics movement?<eos> I've read several articles in "Lancet"<eos> and in other medical journals.
Inspector Brad...<eos> Oh, Neely, there isn't a shipping man in New York who doesn't go out and slip those fellas a 20 every now and again to get a little happy in a pub.<eos> But that is hardly a crime.<eos> If only that was your crime, but it's not.<eos> I know it and Henry knows it.<eos> You move up the sick and the poor to second-class and the inspectors let them into the country where they infest the tenements and the neighborhoods.<eos> People died, Dad.<eos> Lots of them.<eos> In San Francisco and Hawaii.<eos> Here in New York.
Dr. Bertram Chickering Jr.<eos> You can all call me Bertie.<eos> Only in your off-hours.<eos> In the hospital you will be Dr. Chickering.<eos> At Mount Sinai, we're a bit more formal than the Knick.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Anything else?<eos> I am not a Jew.<eos> But I worked on many of them at the Knick. Recent immigrants mostly, so I learned a little Yiddish.<eos> Azoy?
- Thank you so much.<eos> - Very pleased to have you aboard.<eos> - Pleasure to be here.<eos> Oh, Mr. Barrow, a word. - Welcome...<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> Now, my office is just downstairs. Would you mind waiting in the lobby?<eos> Of course.<eos> Mr. Barrow...<eos> Herman, you will be pleased to know that the club has voted to grant your membership.<eos> Really?
Well, Tom Thomas Tom, I'm Susie. And there's no need to be nervous.<eos> Oh, thank you. I've just...<eos> I've never been to one of these before, so...<eos> Oh, well, if I saw a gentleman on the street as handsome as you are, I wouldn't believe there was a fellow more worldly.<eos> I don't know if I would describe myself as worldly.<eos> I... oh, thank you.<eos> I've...<eos> I've never... well, I've...<eos> Well, to tell you the truth, this is my first time, too.<eos> Really?
I'm sure there are lots of people uptown who think you've gone shopping or to the hair parlor.<eos> I don't like being called here by the likes of you.<eos> And I don't give a good goddamn.<eos> We're not out there anymore. We're in here now.<eos> Now listen. My Harriet has got a real God-fearing gavel-banger putting her on trial and he ain't giving her a fair shake.<eos> That's not our concern.<eos> I'm making it your fucking concern.<eos> Each and every one of you uptown ladies came to me for the fix.<eos> And my girl did it for you, safe and secret.<eos> Secret?
You noticed your mother struggling at dinner.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> It's been going on for a while and it's gotten worse.<eos> Has she seen anyone?<eos> We've been to Presbyterian Hospital, Women's Hospital, and Roosevelt. Two experts at Columbia as well.<eos> And?<eos> What's the diagnosis?<eos> An esophageal mass.<eos> When was this taken?<eos> Last week.
You bet your ass I do.<eos> I'm sorry, Doc, but all that hocus-pocus...<eos> Yeah, thanks for wasting our time.<eos> Go on, get out.<eos> I wanted to present something to you.<eos> Are you familiar with Garrison Carr?<eos> No.<eos> He's a bit of an established thinker in certain communities.<eos> He's in need of a hernia repair and I'd like to perform it.<eos> Which communities?
Well, I know how.<eos> Sell Jake's boat.<eos> (laughing): You mean the one that George Tucker lives on?<eos> Yes, the one that you own.<eos> I heard Wally is in the market for a second home.<eos> You can sell it to him.<eos> No... I can't just displace George.<eos> He is your tenant.<eos> You are his landlord.<eos> Or, lake-lord.
Hmm. Lavon: Lemon, Lemon, Lemon.<eos> I bump into her everywhere.<eos> She's even in my dreams, Zoe.<eos> Like last night, I dreamt that it was the first day of school.<eos> But it wasn't school.<eos> It was a, uh, mini-golf course.<eos> And on the ninth hole, Lemon's laying there.<eos> And instead of hitting the ball into the clown's nose, you had to hit the ball into...<eos> Ew. Stop.<eos> Ugh. God.
I am kind of salty.<eos> I can tell.<eos> Did the assholes run away from you, Harry?<eos> No. You told them to sit down, I bet they sat the fuck down.<eos> Most of the time, they did.<eos> Yeah. They sat the fuck down.<eos> I know they did.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> - Oh, am I hurting you?<eos> - No, in a good way.
I like the view so much,<eos> I put the other sup there, too.<eos> It's peaceful, serene.<eos> How many murders are we talking about exactly?<eos> Oh. Are we now negotiating in good faith... señor?<eos> This won't take long.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Detective.<eos> The Lieutenant?<eos> Restroom, sir.
Wait till she's out of sight.<eos> She did everything she could to protect him, and I don't want her knowing that it was her fault that the lying little scumbag got busted.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Why is Milt Chamberlain in Battle Creek?<eos> The truth.<eos> No more crap about how much you loved the guy.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Hey, pal, it's only a matter of time before the whole department's told that Milt was banished from Detroit because he was having an affair with your wife.<eos> Is the truth worse for you than that?<eos> Actually, yes.
Hello, Emma.<eos> Who is this?<eos> A friend.<eos> Sorry, I'm not in the mood.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> What?<eos> I hate to see you so sad.<eos> Are you watching me?<eos> It's what you want, right?<eos> On Instagram and Facebook.
I could have offered this to anybody.<eos> She's got really credible-sounding information about an armed robbery.<eos> ~ Would you like the Air Miles or not?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I saw him on the telly, clear as a bell.<eos> I live pause, poked it back a bit, and there he was, freeze-frame.<eos> Him to a T!<eos> Couldn't not be him.<eos> To a T!
- Look how that turned out. - (laughs)<eos> - I promise I'll nail this.<eos> - I know you will, sweetie.<eos> You just have to keep running catechism with your sister.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine, why?<eos> It's your last day at the hospital.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's weird after all these years, but I hope I'll have something soon.<eos> - As in job?
You were too busy demanding a bunch of zeros.<eos> Well, I was just looking out for you.<eos> Those suits don't pay for themselves.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Mike, great job.<eos> You really stepped it up.<eos> Thanks, Harvey.<eos> I think you might be starting to come into your own too.<eos> Really?<eos> Every single game?
Well, I was just looking out for you.<eos> Those suits don't pay for themselves.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Mike, great job.<eos> You really stepped it up.<eos> Thanks, Harvey.<eos> I think you might be starting to come into your own too.<eos> Really?<eos> Every single game?<eos> No, just the playoffs.
So how does this end, Marmion? Hm?<eos> You kill us all and then what?<eos> What have you achieved?<eos> Balance.<eos> A harmony in nature.<eos> A shout of defiance in the face of an indifferent universe.<eos> If I'm going to die for a cause I'd like to know what it is.<eos> Does the name Gerberoy mean anything to you?<eos> Gerberoy?<eos> No.
We've been in enough trouble already.<eos> I could have been anybody.<eos> Watch the watchers.<eos> All right, well, the front entrance is a bit overcrowded.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Odds are that you've never been able to have a passport.<eos> How the fuck did you end up working in a travel agent?<eos> I mean, ain't that, like, self-harming or something?<eos> It was an obsession in prison.<eos> Not at first.
He's here!<eos> ~ He's still here!<eos> ~ We've been had.<eos> He's on foot.<eos> I want a chopper, I want dogs, and I want them now.<eos> Shit!<eos> Intercept vehicle at junction of Mill Road and Albert Drive.<eos> ~ That fucking cat...<eos> ~ What cat?<eos> ~ On his arm.
Enough!<eos> Enough with the hitting.<eos> Are you done?<eos> Where, Jimmy?<eos> Where?<eos> I was incommunicado for a while.<eos> For weeks, for months?<eos> About a year.<eos> On a boat.<eos> A yacht, actually.
- Why?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - Wh-- what did Ian do?<eos> So that went well.<eos> You're gonna love Florida, man.<eos> It's fantastic.<eos> No snow, ever.<eos> Nothing but sun and white beaches and palm trees and-- oh, and pools.<eos> Pools in every fucking backyard.<eos> Every backyard.
He could be anywhere by now.<eos> - Maybe he's in Colorado.<eos> - Colorado? - Why would he be in Colorado?<eos> - Free weed.<eos> Not free, idiot. Legalized.<eos> Shouldn't somebody call the police?<eos> No!<eos> Weeds are free in Colorado?<eos> Uh-huh. That's right, sweetie.<eos> - Oh, Jesus.
Many a friend did break and many more will follow.<eos> My Lord Basset!<eos> There are bailiffs at Wheal Reath.<eos> "Tis a fool's game...'<eos> You can't do this!<eos> Back!<eos> '..it will end in tears.'<eos> I admire your optimism.<eos> Your father died afore his time.<eos> In his bed.
Those ruffians at Wheal Reath made a nuisance of themselves.<eos> You'd hardly expect them to celebrate the closure.<eos> They have no business to have an opinion at all!<eos> Some would say that view is outdated.<eos> In America, for instance, they have more liberal views.<eos> All men created equal?<eos> Preposterous!<eos> Distinctions of rank must be preserved.<eos> Especially when they're so dearly bought.<eos> To the Trade!
I should not have said that!<eos> What must you think of me?<eos> Can you be unaware of that, ma'am?<eos> Remind me, Captain Poldark, was I engaged to you for this next dance?<eos> Not that I recall.<eos> Would you excuse me?<eos> Ah, Ross, are you come to take my wife off my hands?<eos> If she's no objection.<eos> Did you not promise me this dance?<eos> The cotillion.
Have her delay it as long as possible.<eos> I wish you could forget him, my dear.<eos> Is love so easy to forget?<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I didn't mean... I didn't mean to suggest...<eos> Mrs Tabb, send for Dr Choake.<eos> I wonder you do not think of marriage, Captain Poldark?<eos> I dare say I shall, in due course.<eos> Always remembering the purpose for which it was ordained?<eos> In particular...?
Yes, sir.<eos> And tomorrow I be startin' on the meadow.<eos> You get through more in a day than Prudie in a month!<eos> I be young, sir.<eos> And strong...<eos> And not bone idle.<eos> I heard Jinny was over.<eos> How is she?<eos> In truth, sir, she's that worried.<eos> ~ About what?
My name is Poldark.<eos> Did Verity send you?<eos> No.<eos> She's no idea I've come.<eos> No-one does.<eos> It was made clear long ago that Verity was not for me.<eos> I've since moved on, set my sights elsewhere.<eos> You're married?<eos> To my ship.<eos> To my profession.
~ The infamous Matthew Sanson?<eos> ~ Does his infamy extend beyond bankrupting Francis?<eos> It extends almost everywhere and he has George's endorsement,<eos> ~ which makes him...<eos> ~ A force to be reckoned with. ~ A man of means, though, sadly, not of generosity.<eos> Is that collar not a gift of his?<eos> No, indeed.<eos> The giver was a man of taste.<eos> Could you manage without me, while I visit the chandler?<eos> On no account.
Your daughter is good with a baby.<eos> That's got to be nice.<eos> Oh, she's not mine.<eos> She's Kevin's.<eos> Oh, well, she's pretty.<eos> So is he.<eos> His secret is moisturizing.<eos> So you have family around here?<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - In Jarden.
- Of course.<eos> You've made a real commitment here, Danny.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> I talked to Gwen about a raise.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> This'll be a big help.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Where are we?<eos> A boat.
You can answer.<eos> I don't know, probably six or seven beers.<eos> What did you see when you came out of the restroom?<eos> The Mexican guy grabbed the victim, threw him down and pulled a knife.<eos> Mr. Mejia's Cuban.<eos> But you're saying that you saw Mr. Mejia draw a weapon.<eos> - Clear as day.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, then, I'm just wondering what hand he might have had a knife in.<eos> His right hand.
Shut up.<eos> Just, everything that's happened and this game on Saturday,<eos> I need her.<eos> Yo, grab some Zen. Forget about the scout from Duke, forget about Emma and forget about Nina's murder.<eos> And any cyber-connection to Nina, 'cause it doesn't exist.<eos> Correct?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> We are officially cerrado.<eos> That's closed.<eos> For business.
Jenna appeared right around, uh, the time he was 16.<eos> And you have to understand, for his generation, it's not a drag-show performance... the world's a stage.<eos> Uh, last year, he started his own blog.<eos> Oh, my god, a blogger... another motivation for murder.<eos> Why?<eos> Everybody who ever met Jason loved him.<eos> Do you mean that literally?<eos> Would you say Jason had a lot of sexual encounters?<eos> In the past, but he was young.<eos> In the past?
On a Sunday?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Why me?<eos> Well, he said that... asians are terrified of black people and missionaries, and you're both of them.<eos> Han: Jason and Marcus were very serious about adopting a child.<eos> When we heard Jason was dead, our first thought was that poor Marcus might kill himself.<eos> Is that why you bring a minister with you on these calls?<eos> Well, actually, I'm...<eos> Marcus is fine...<eos> Perhaps a little too fine.
- Oscar?<eos> - Yes, I'm Oscar!<eos> - Hey, Felix.<eos> - Casey.<eos> Oscar said you wouldn't be back until 8:35<eos> - on the morning of the 21st.<eos> - Just ignore him.<eos> And whatever you do, don't ask him about the...<eos> - Is that a vacuum cleaner?<eos> - ...vacuum cleaner.
500 tuition-paying students?<eos> A thousand?<eos> I don't even want to get into what starts happening if my family gets litigious.<eos> I mean, you've met his mom, right?<eos> You want to deal with that?<eos> Something like this drags on in the press for months and years,<eos> Or...<eos> Or the whole thing dies right now.<eos> Right here.<eos> Right in this room.
- What are you doing here? Some guy on the Internet paid me 200 bucks to drive here.<eos> And said to give this to some girl.<eos> - What? - Check my front pocket. Check my pocket.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> Riles.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> What're you thinking about?<eos> Besides Tyler?<eos> Noah.
- _<eos> - What do you have?<eos> - All right.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess we can keep driving.<eos> Yeah, I just got to figure out where else to look. Hello?<eos> Riley!<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Where are you?<eos> - The station.
Two of the three lights busted.<eos> The abductor stands over there in the darkness and he watches the girl under this light...<eos> Making sure that she's alone.<eos> The lieutenant said we have 24 hours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And we're running out of time.<eos> She said, "good is good, but bad is better."<eos> Yeah?<eos> Tell Paquet to check her e-mail.<eos> - Paquet!
Talk.<eos> We found some women's clothing in a closet and evidence of a baby.<eos> My wife left with our daughter months ago.<eos> She realized you were a homicidal freak?<eos> Can you provide her whereabouts?<eos> I would love to know where she is.<eos> Lying in a shallow grave next to Lacy Siddon.<eos> Ah.<eos> Detective Dunn, did you or your team discover a cane with a hooded man<eos> - on the handle?
What are you doing?<eos> I need to get him out of the car, sweetie.<eos> But he doesn't look good.<eos> You can't just leave him at a bus stop.<eos> - Amy, please.<eos> - He just wants to get to his brother's house.<eos> - Amy.<eos> - Mom, please.<eos> We should take him to the hospital.<eos> At 4:10 p.m. today, on live television,
- You'll tell me if you're not OK?<eos> - Yeah, it's fine.<eos> It's fine.<eos> No.<eos> No, I think you should be on top.<eos> I don't wanna, like...<eos> I don't wanna explain...<eos> OK.<eos> - It's OK?<eos> - OK, yeah, just...
You still in London?<eos> I'm home.<eos> This is where I grew up.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> This is the piano where my dad practices every morning.<eos> When I was little, I used to lay on this rug with my coloring book, listening to him.<eos> When I think of the word "happy," that rug is the first thing that comes into my head.<eos> Your dad's kind of a big deal, huh?<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> Especially in Iceland.
To me, the idea of praying to a god to somehow influence my own fate is both primitive and terribly sad.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't think this is the place to have this conversation.<eos> Something's wrong?<eos> What is it?<eos> Is it Joaquin, right?<eos> - He's gonna blackmail me.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, I haven't heard from him.<eos> Is it Daniela?<eos> In a way.
Do you live here, in Iceland?<eos> I do.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Why didn't you tell me the truth?<eos> I needed you to believe me.<eos> I needed you to believe...<eos> that you weren't safe here, because you're not.<eos> There were two worlds.<eos> I was living in...<eos> in two separate worlds.
_<eos> Abraham Setrakian, come and have your soup.<eos> Abraham!<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> - Tell me one more story, Bubbeh.<eos> - It late now, Abraham.<eos> There's barely enough time for a tale.<eos> Maybe... while you finish your soup.<eos> What story do you want to hear?<eos> Sardu, Bubbeh.
Abraham!<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> - Tell me one more story, Bubbeh.<eos> - It late now, Abraham.<eos> There's barely enough time for a tale.<eos> Maybe... while you finish your soup.<eos> What story do you want to hear?<eos> Sardu, Bubbeh.<eos> Will you tell me his story?<eos> Sardu? Again?
You know what they say.<eos> You've got to stay on top of the food chain, O.G.<eos> You and five strigoi?<eos> - Not very smart. - Silence.<eos> You will approach with all due respect.<eos> They exist... the Ancients.<eos> They're sleeping now, but they can hear and understand everything.<eos> I speak for them.<eos> What do you know of the seventh one of their kind?<eos> The... the seventh?
- I'm a Red Sox fan, yeah.<eos> - Really?<eos> Where did you grow up? My mother's French, my father's American from Boston.<eos> I've never been to a baseball game.<eos> You're kidding me?<eos> Health issues, the distractions of my career...<eos> No, sadly, I have never gone.<eos> Oh, you must go.<eos> Baseball can make you feel like a little boy again,<eos> - in the best possible way.
Dad, we're not involving the feds.<eos> Look, you're just upset because they took you off the case.<eos> - Joan, please.<eos> - Look, someone's gotta go!<eos> Joan, we will decide who's going.<eos> Could you give us a minute, please?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Liz, let's just slow down, we...<eos> We need to talk about some things.<eos> - What things?
Look, you're just upset because they took you off the case.<eos> - Joan, please.<eos> - Look, someone's gotta go!<eos> Joan, we will decide who's going.<eos> Could you give us a minute, please?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Liz, let's just slow down, we...<eos> We need to talk about some things.<eos> - What things?<eos> - Things about Lori.
- And I will finish my degree, Bill!<eos> - Virginia, calm down.<eos> Is there not one square inch of my life that you haven't insinuated yourself into?<eos> My work, my home, my bed.<eos> Can I not even have a bathroom stall to myself?<eos> Look, I will accept your apology later.<eos> For now, you have five minutes, and then we're going back out there, and we are continuing this presentation like the polished and professional researchers that we are.<eos> Five minutes, Virginia.<eos> As the unrest in Saigon continues along with Prime Minister Ký's crackdown on the Buddhist rebels, including the arrest of South Vietnamese.<eos> And now to the weather...
We've been acquired by a large overseas company.<eos> But you will stay on as president, then?<eos> Hi, could you just...<eos> could you tell him...<eos> Actually, I think it's time for me to move on.<eos> I need to go to the power company.<eos> - I need to leave. - Oh, so, sayonara, 9:00 to 5:00, huh?<eos> Uh, I've given serious thought to starting my own investment firm... out of my garage.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Why the garage?
- Wow.<eos> - He's driving up to Dallas tomorrow to collect his share of the company sale.<eos> - But that's not the whole story.<eos> - No, it... it's not.<eos> But the outcome is the same.<eos> So what are you gonna do with all that dough?<eos> I'm going to start my own company.<eos> That's great.<eos> Here?<eos> No, in California.
If Shawn woke up cold and alone...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I need to talk to your son.<eos> Please, he's a good boy.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey, Shawn.<eos> I'm Detective Diamond.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> About what?<eos> About the other night.
- But you changed the channel yesterday.<eos> - Guys, please.<eos> - I hate this show. - Mommy?<eos> All I'm saying is it would be a good thing if you and Tasha could get out of Schlobohm.<eos> And this place ain't gonna get no better.<eos> You want Lorna Doones or... - Nilla Wafers?<eos> - I'm serious, Ma.<eos> Now, there are other places besides Schlobohm for black folk.<eos> You think School Street Projects gonna be any better?<eos> - Or Mulford? - An apartment, Ma.
"No policeman when you call for help," "no firefighter when your house is burning." "No garbage pickup as the trash piles up on the curb."<eos> "The question is," "can you reasonably accept these consequences," "which loom as a direct result"<eos> It's okay.<eos> We got this, little man, huh? All right.<eos> (BABY COUGHS)<eos> Okay. Let's just check it out.<eos> (SPEAKING SPANISH)<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Listen to me, Javier, because I'm gonna tell you in English.<eos> English, yes.
When I showed that first batch of pictures to the council meeting, there were people there who thought I was trying to exaggerate.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> If you don't respect yourself, you can't respect anybody else.<eos> Councilman, I spoke with Oscar Newman, and he argues that by concentrating the poor in projects like this, you pretty much guaranteed the outcome.<eos> He said that by scattering low-income housing...<eos> Yeah, I know everything Oscar Newman said, and it doesn't work.<eos> All it takes is one or two bad houses, and pretty soon the whole block goes to hell.<eos> Just ask people what happened in the Bronx.<eos> - Well, the Bronx...
I got endorsed by The New York Times. I got endorsed by Moynihan, by Governor Cuomo.<eos> I got the teachers, I got the unions, and I kicked his ass in the debate. (SIGHS)<eos> What the fuck does it take? Whatever happens, you know you did the right thing.<eos> And if you lose, it won't be to stop the housing.<eos> It'll be to punish you. You see that, why can't they?<eos> Well, they aren't in love with you.<eos> - (SCOFFS)<eos> Why aren't they?<eos> I'm lovable. - Yeah, to me.<eos> - To everybody.
- I know it's a curb.<eos> Testers.<eos> Got the testers.<eos> One a person. Yellow tops ain't no trifle.<eos> - Tell your friends about it.<eos> - Over here. Easy. Easy, man.<eos> Now declaring David Dinkins the winner over Rudy Giuliani in the race for mayor of New York.<eos> With nearly all of the districts reporting to you live, Dinkins is leading... - Okay. Thank you.<eos> Well, that's the ball game.<eos> MICHAEL:
See you later, Pop.<eos> We're gonna put you down for a nap, little man.<eos> Don't you worry, we're gonna put you down for a nap.<eos> He's just overtired is all.<eos> I want to thank you for helping me with the groceries this month, Daddy.<eos> When that man got my purse at the Palisades bus stop, he took my whole check.<eos> I had just cashed out.<eos> Those damn things.<eos> They're all over the building from the damn junkies.<eos> In the hallway, in the elevator.
You don't even know what they gonna charge him with.<eos> What'd he do exactly?<eos> I don't know nothing else, just that the police went to his mother's apartment and told her something about him having a knife and trying to rob some men--<eos> A knife?<eos> Look, if you ask me, homeboy's an asshole for going around - jacking people like that.<eos> - I didn't ask you, did I?<eos> - I'm just saying. - No, fuck you, Meeka.<eos> Come on, that's my man.<eos> Where's he at now?<eos> Rikers?
Acting up?<eos> Yeah, my... my Twix is stuck.<eos> Yeah, they're tricky sometimes.<eos> Gets hung up on the little ridges.<eos> Ridges?<eos> On the chocolate part.
How's he gonna feel about that?<eos> That's his business.<eos> This isn't.<eos> Did they find George's car?<eos> No.<eos> No, they didn't.<eos> What is it?<eos> I... talked to George's father a few days ago.<eos> He said George had been out of sorts for some time now.<eos> Out of sorts?
You know, the right thing to say for now.<eos> Can I at least ask where you are?<eos> Sure.<eos> At Beth's.<eos> And Mitch's?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's just right down the road.<eos> It's not that far.<eos> I might go to Miss Kathy's next week.<eos> Next week?
They had two miscarriages before Maty.<eos> Good for them.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Look, I, uh, I got a customer, so...<eos> Oh. Oh, okay.<eos> Okay. Thanks for checking in.<eos> We've never gotten this far, have we, buddy?<eos> I mean, we've never been over here.<eos> The final stop.
I've got it, but... sure.<eos> We'll be gone a few days.<eos> I mean, I will... Three or four.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Want me to check the oil for you?<eos> I'll just check it on the way out.<eos> Janet?<eos> I just got off the phone with Teddy.<eos> Teddy?<eos> About what?
He didn't.<eos> Dad asked me to help him with it.<eos> But I got it finished.<eos> I'm sure Janet appreciates that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well I think I just got about everything out of here I need.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'd like to change the locks.<eos> Locks?<eos> Here at the house.
Right there... and his gun.<eos> We'll just have to wait till the river goes down to come back.<eos> Oh, that'll take a while.<eos> Like finding a needle in a haystack anyhow.<eos> Trey Willis, you're under arrest for the murder of George Melton.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Jesus, Carl!<eos> Anything you say can and will be held against you...<eos> Can't do this!<eos> In a court of law.
Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> I just-- We haven't checked in.<eos> I wanted to make sure that you're okay with everything--<eos> Me, here.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I got your text.<eos> I'm just in character.<eos> Characters.
In the beginning, a star fell from heaven and changed us.<eos> Made us angels and gave us a new destiny:<eos> to stop the Apocalypse and the Devil himself.<eos> We must pass God's test and prove humanity is still worth saving.<eos> For we are the Messengers.<eos> Previously on The Messengers...
What happened last month?<eos> I was in Monaco... with a lovely tax advisor.<eos> When I got back, I found a hole under my vault, all the way to the sewer.<eos> Somebody cleaned me out.<eos> A couple of weeks later, my bad babies...<eos> They start turning up on the black market.<eos> But why run?<eos> Why not tell the Senate the truth, ask for their help?<eos> Apparently, it's not too big a jump to see me cutting a hole in my own vault and making some money on the sly.<eos> Really?
- They like you, OK?<eos> You're a big... muscle-y distraction, and we need that right now.<eos> Look, our warrant is for Constance, remember?<eos> And when it comes down to it, she's the one we need to save.<eos> How do you think the others will react when they figure that bit out?<eos> No idea. Neither do you.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> I grew up in a place just like this.<eos> - You grew up in a fertility cult?<eos> - OK, not exactly like this;
This is what I want.<eos> Someone has to protect the vessels, for as long as the girls are called to serve.<eos> And after everything they gave up for me, how can I abandon my sisters?<eos> They'll be lucky to have you.<eos> - You ready?<eos> - No.<eos> Girls are finally asleep.<eos> Algae brew?<eos> She was on Qresh.<eos> In the capital city.
- Don't need any.<eos> I've got a Kill Warrant says otherwise.<eos> Kill warrants are usually personal.<eos> Takes a lot of money and power to make one stick.<eos> Who do you know that hates you that much?<eos> No idea.<eos> Look, you don't want me here, I don't want to be here, so why don't you just drop me off at the next port and I'll be on my way.<eos> - What?<eos> - Once a Kill Warrant is written, it's guaranteed.<eos> - Meaning?
- How do you know?<eos> He's hiding a datachip inside the ring.<eos> Whatever he stole from the Company, I bet it's on that.<eos> Target's on the move.<eos> Be ready to evac in five.<eos> - D'av, prepare for takedown.<eos> - That was such a lovely blessing.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - What the hell? !<eos> Up there.
On me.<eos> Ah, ah! He got papers?<eos> - He's just passing through.<eos> - Can't serve illegals.<eos> But damn if you don't look extra thirsty.<eos> Thanks, Pree.<eos> Hey.<eos> Excuse me, guys.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> What?
Ah, ah! He got papers?<eos> - He's just passing through.<eos> - Can't serve illegals.<eos> But damn if you don't look extra thirsty.<eos> Thanks, Pree.<eos> Hey.<eos> Excuse me, guys.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> What?<eos> My Rack debrief?
Natalie, you're angry, but you have no right to blame your mother for anything.<eos> But I can blame you.<eos> Yeah, you can.<eos> You can. I did this to our family.<eos> You had help.<eos> What did you do, mom?<eos> Nothing.<eos> She didn't do anything.<eos> This is on me, Abby.<eos> All of it.
Nunchakus and a pack of condoms.<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> - Magnum.<eos> Chuckles, let's go.<eos> - Good morning, delicious family. SAMMI:<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Take more than that to get rid of me, my bastard of a daughter. CARL:<eos> Where were you?<eos> - Hospital. CARL:<eos> Hospital?
What else you got here?<eos> Whoa, kerosene.<eos> Some torn rags, some matches.<eos> So... there's no question that you're going away for the attempted murder of your cousin Vito, yeah?<eos> So what?<eos> Well, and since I'm pretty sure that you used this same bag of tricks for the fire this morning at Sean Markel's, I'll bet that's his DNA on the brick.<eos> Which means that you're going away for that attempted murder, too.<eos> So what?<eos> Oh. We've got the forensics report from Guziewicz's house, and once we match the kerosene to the glass, then you're going away for that fire, as well.<eos> For what?
Ah, that's the stuff.<eos> How's Alex doing?<eos> He's hanging in there.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Means he's hanging in there!<eos> Get on with it.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Don't look at it.<eos> Just think about something else, okay?<eos> Like your kid.
We'll worry about Mars later.<eos> Good so far?<eos> Good signal.<eos> We've got three hours of juice.<eos> Well...<eos> I guess all we gotta do now is pop a cold beer, and wait to be rescued.<eos> Nope.<eos> Got no record of a Razorback on these docks.<eos> Any, um, special hangar where rich people keep their pleasure-craft?<eos> On Ceres?
And I hope that it never does.<eos> Do you think that we can do this?<eos> I do.<eos> Easy, killer.<eos> Kenzi's obeying speed limits.<eos> No texting and driving.<eos> A little singing and eating...<eos> They're safe.<eos> Well, she is in very good hands.<eos> The best.
You're underage.<eos> But, what you can do is sign this.<eos> Right.<eos> The Ledger.<eos> So, what's next?<eos> Choose if I'm Light or Dark.<eos> Not in this colony.<eos> We're fighting to change some old rules.<eos> So that one day, no Fae will ever have to choose.<eos> Anywhere.
Excuse me!<eos> Can I just have a quick word there, please, sir.<eos> Police.<eos> There you are. Rachel.<eos> Are you aware you're about to enter a brothel there, sir?<eos> Is that illegal in Durham?<eos> No, it's not illegal, no, but running one is, and we're doing our best to discourage it.<eos> Aye, prosecuting the girls doesn't work, so we've decided to publish the name of the customers.<eos> Very commendable.<eos> In the paper.
~ Right, give me five minutes to get a cup of tea.<eos> ~ All right.<eos> Excuse me? Excuse me? !<eos> Mr Gently... ~ Where on earth do you think you're going?<eos> Right, Tina.<eos> I'm all ears.<eos> Who's been raping you then, pet?<eos> There were three of them.<eos> Where are we?<eos> In The Dun Cow.
Right, so there's four of you sitting in The Dun Cow...<eos> Ah, no. We weren't sitting together, like.<eos> I was on me own.<eos> Drinking on your own?<eos> Not against the law, is it?<eos> No, no, no, it's not against the law.<eos> So this was... yesterday, was it?<eos> No.<eos> Tuesday afternoon, week before last.<eos> Week before last?
Hey, listen, it wasn't me, Gem.<eos> It wasn't.<eos> Oh, God, will you stop hiding behind your boss?<eos> !<eos> You're just a snivelling little coward!<eos> ~ You're not half the man Walter is!<eos> ~ Gemma, please.<eos> Never come anywhere near me ever again... ~ Gem, please.<eos> No, no, no...<eos> ~ .. in your pathetic little life!
Didn't you think it felt... weird?<eos> Yeah, but what doesn't right now?<eos> I wasn't in control of it, but it worked.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> It's the perks to having a Succubus girlfriend.<eos> I'm on a stakeout, I'll call you later.<eos> Except I think I was the one being the Succubus.<eos> The last time you breathed life back into someone...<eos> It was you.<eos> At my Dawning.
What are you doing out here alone?<eos> My brother and I were on our way to the City of Light, and wastelanders attacked.<eos> They took our horse, all our water, everything.<eos> They killed him.<eos> This cart is all I have left.<eos> Give her some water.<eos> Whoa, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> We barely have enough for ourselves here.<eos> Touch me again, and I'll end you.<eos> In a noncriminal way.
Humor.<eos> It's just what I do.<eos> There are a thousand Grounders camped in the woods waiting to go get my friends, and they can't move because... because I can't figure this out.<eos> Hey.<eos> No one could.<eos> It's a tough ask, not without more data.<eos> Ok.<eos> So, they make fog that melts people.<eos> What are we talking?<eos> Nucleation?
Thanks.<eos> You're very sweet.<eos> And I'm also happy you're going to be sticking around for a while, because we have so much fun working together, and... all the fun.<eos> Well, what do you say we enjoy every last minute of it, then?<eos> Want to get that Breadstix dinner back on the books?<eos> Uh, yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.<eos> Um, next Thursday?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> Abuela.
Musk rulez, with a "Z."<eos> Password verified.<eos> Manual control enabled.<eos> Welcome, friends.<eos> I have invited you here to share in our first quarterly profit report.<eos> I'm sure you're all eager to hear how much richer I am.<eos> Now, to end the suspense,<eos> Elon?<eos> Thank you, Monty.<eos> At our current rate... Yes?
Hey, coach, I want you to know that I've taken steps to battle the scourge of cisnormativity - Uh-huh. - And transmisogyny.<eos> And some other terms I had never heard of until I did a quick Wikipedia search this morning.<eos> Um, thanks, but I just want things to go - right on back to normal. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Oh, good 'cause I wro... had this list of all these pronouns.<eos> I mean, you just tell me which one and I'll enforce it.<eos> There's he, there's sh-he, there's it, zhim, ze...<eos> I-I think he and him works fine.<eos> Now, coach, as you know, I've always been quite vocal about my opposition to bullying in any form.<eos> And I want you to know that I am here for you as a friend, ally and a shoulder to cry on.<eos> Metaphorically, of course.
Okay.<eos> Cool.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Who was it?<eos> I just heard.<eos> I want names.<eos> Which one of those Vocal Adrenaline bastards did it?<eos> What the fall leaves are you talking about, pumpkin?<eos> Your car, the vandalism.
I just want to be one of the guys.<eos> But there's no one else like me here.<eos> You know, people either fawn over me or they hate me because they don't understand me.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> - Did it hurt?<eos> - Are you joking?<eos> Like a bucket of hammers being dumped on my chest.<eos> But the weird thing... it felt like they never should have been there in the first place.<eos> Do you have any regrets?<eos> Not for a second.
- They're the Feds.<eos> Think they fucking tell me anything?<eos> Clay.<eos> Hey. John Rayburn.<eos> We met at the regional commission.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Good to see you again.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I think we saw each other this morning.<eos> At the bait shop.
- Today.<eos> - You got it.<eos> No problem.<eos> Watch your step, folks.<eos> The AC's on and running so make yourselves comfortable.<eos> We got an hour ride to Miami International.<eos> Hey, Carlos.<eos> This bag's gotta go too.<eos> Gas her up on the way back.<eos> Mile marker 94.
No.<eos> He must have taken it hard, losing the restaurant.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did. Went on a bender.<eos> Coke.<eos> Vodka.<eos> More coke.<eos> Then he got weird.<eos> Weird?<eos> How?
Back in high school, every weekend my girlfriends and I would hang out near the Navy base.<eos> We were about 17, so we had to take turns finding a sailor to buy us liquor.<eos> No.<eos> That's how you met Dad?<eos> I thought Aunt Charlotte introduced you.<eos> That's the story that your father liked to tell.<eos> I'd sneak out of the house, me and my girlfriends, and we'd hitchhike all the way to the east side of town to this bar called Ruby's.<eos> Must have been my turn to find a sailor.<eos> I remember looking around the room and there he was.<eos> In uniform.
This to-mah-to?<eos> Carol, just say "tomato."<eos> Phil, some people say "to-mah-to."<eos> I'm one of those people.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Now, I grew this personally, and I would love to grow more, but I need help getting water to my garden.<eos> Are you in? Are you out?<eos> Oh, I'm definitely out.<eos> I was never even close to being in.<eos> In any way.
Matty, Matty!<eos> Matty, just stay there!<eos> Just stay there.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Calm down, buddy. Come on.<eos> It's okay, Matty. It's okay!<eos> Listen, Matty, you're okay!<eos> All right, I won't touch you!<eos> Come on, let's just go home.<eos> Home, Matty, okay?
Tyler vandalized the fence and Christy's car.<eos> He's trying to divert attention from him to me.<eos> You're taking it seriously?<eos> I take everything seriously.<eos> Your situation reminds me of the halcro case.<eos> Mr. halcro was murdered, and shortly into the investigation, his wife called me up and said she had received a threatening greeting card and feared for her life.<eos> And, eventually, I realized that she had sent the card herself.<eos> She wanted to be viewed more as a victim, not as a suspect.<eos> But in the end, she was convicted of falsifying a police report and...<eos> Murder.
- I...<eos> I have something to say.<eos> The document I have prepared shows the scope of our expansion.<eos> Expansion is healthy.<eos> Yes, and so is prudence.<eos> Gentlemen, the cost of war is still with us.<eos> Surplus female staff are currently adding 16.4% to our payroll.<eos> All this whilst pursuing an ambitious expansion programme.<eos> We now have 12 new stores.<eos> More in our sightlines.
How clever of you to employ her talents here.<eos> She took part in the modeling of the dresses with Selfridge panache and flair.<eos> She's always had an eye for the spotlight, our Violette.<eos> So have I earned something more permanent here?<eos> If it was any other day, but thank you so much for helping out.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Verdun.<eos> You know, your lot holding out probably turned the war.<eos> - You?<eos> - Mostly the Somme.
He will have a seat on our board.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I... needed to raise capital for a business venture.<eos> So you sold us out.<eos> It's not as it seems.<eos> Get out of my sight.<eos> Get out.<eos> GEORGE:<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> VIOLETTE: The seaside.

Her grandmother spoke to me.<eos> What has my marriage to do with Lois Selfridge - or you, for that matter?<eos> Because we live with them.<eos> We need them.<eos> - YOU need them, to pay your bills.<eos> - Serge.<eos> Everyone in this house is expecting me to fail and this is my chance to make something of myself.<eos> A marriage also needs tending if it is to grow.<eos> Talk to her.<eos> About what?
No, er, no charge, Tommy.<eos> You know, it's Olivia Goldsmith I feel sorry for.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Well, er, Emma and her husband, they worked really closely together, if you know what I mean.<eos> Ah! Great minds think alike.<eos> Doc, you can't keep doing this.<eos> Come on, Charlie.<eos> We're all family.<eos> Hey, if Munro finds out you're here, he'll have my bloody head!<eos> In your own little world, as always.

He's never called me fat.<eos> I mean, that's better than most of the jerks at this school.<eos> I guess when I got tossed into the Dumpster, he let me take off my Marc Jacobs jacket.<eos> That was kind of nice.<eos> He is awfully c-cute.<eos> Maybe he's not that different than us.<eos> Maybe he just wants to be accepted for who he is and not for what people label him as.<eos> And if we start excluding people, then we're no different than the people who exclude us.<eos> So far, my time at McKinley has sucked.<eos> But... not this week.
I got a "C" on my math test.<eos> When I have a bad day, I usually drown my sorrows in endless breadsticks at Breadstix.<eos> Hmm. It is as good as they say?<eos> Have you never been?<eos> No, my mom says it's infested with cockroaches.<eos> Oh, no, it's okay. They fumigated.<eos> Maybe I could take you next week?<eos> I could teach you how to eat your feelings.<eos> Mmm, where are we eating?<eos> Um, Breadstix.
Inside each of your envelopes you will find your very own honeymoon showcase showdown.<eos> Oh, but we already booked a honeymoon.<eos> Oh, but I canceled that honeymoon.<eos> A weekend trip to Provincetown?<eos> Staying in Andrew Sullivan's cabana house?<eos> Well, Andrew's an old friend of mine.<eos> Or he used to be.<eos> We're not speaking now; it's a long story.<eos> A month-long, all-expenses-paid trip to the Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island<eos> - in the Bahamas. - In the Bahamas.
What was that?<eos> Yeah, you guys, we're in this together now.<eos> Okay? You can count on us.<eos> And I think we should make a pact, to, um, celebrate our anniversaries together every year for the rest of our lives.<eos> - Or maybe like every fifth year?<eos> - Fifth.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> - I think we must do it every year.<eos> - Skype.
is making twice what we are writing for blogs, working from home in their underwear.<eos> We're hanging on by our fingertips, Ben.<eos> You really want to be greasing that ledge?<eos> Make it visual, all right?<eos> I'll call down to Graphics, see if I can drum up a chart.<eos> Oh, and, um... I'll put in a call to the insurance drones, see what I can do, okay?<eos> Would you like us to reiterate the terms of attorney-client privilege, Mr. Healy?<eos> Think I got it.<eos> Then you know anything you tell us stays in this room.<eos> Just like church.
You okay, hon?<eos> Yeah, I stood up too fast is all.<eos> Help you, Officer?<eos> Sir, please roll up your window.<eos> My friend up front doesn't like to talk to strangers.<eos> Well, he's gonna talk to me.<eos> Rock County.<eos> It's like, "What's that town on The Flintstones?"<eos> Is that where we are?<eos> On The Flintstones?
Shot him right through the cigar.<eos> A one-in-a-million shot.<eos> And the look on his face when he fell-- just like the cook.<eos> Bafflement.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This...<eos> German captain hung himself-- 1945.<eos> Found him in a bunker during the mop-up.<eos> Face all purple, eyes bugged out.<eos> Then, in '62,
And these days, well...<eos> Sometimes wonder if you boys didn't bring that war home with ya.<eos> Hey.<eos> Burning it at both ends, huh?<eos> Uh, y-yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Double shift for me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hear what happened?<eos> - At that Waffle Hut, yeah.
Right, pop?<eos> Look, it's not just the business.<eos> It's the country.<eos> This no-brains Jimmy Carter with his stupid peanut grin, and now I got to wait in line to fill my tank?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Where does it end?<eos> Enough-- all of you.<eos> It may be we have to fight, and I'm not afraid of a war.<eos> I'm not.<eos> But on my terms-- as a last resort.
- ...someplace, now that the shop's gone.<eos> Peggy... before you, uh...<eos> Before you start making plans, you should know I got a forensic team coming down from the Twin Cities in the morning.<eos> And I know it's been repaired, but we're gonna check your car for blood.<eos> Microscopically, I mean, which... you'd be amazed at what we can find on the atomic level these days.<eos> No. I mean...<eos> Y-you can't do that, of course, without permission from the owner, you know, so--<eos> Oh, we got permission, about an hour ago.<eos> You sold the car to Sonny Greer, didn't ya?<eos> Earlier at the body shop.
"Ironside" and...<eos> This is all too important to make mistakes here.<eos> So get me a lawyer, a good one.<eos> And if he says... then I'll- - I'll talk.<eos> No, Sonny, they just called themselves plumbers, but what it was, was a special investigative unit inside the White House.<eos> Hey, Karl.<eos> - Percy.<eos> - Got a customer for you.<eos> A client, I guess you'd...<eos> Over at the station.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Milligan?<eos> No, he wasn't there.<eos> You can bet they're gonna come back at us hard.<eos> I thought they'd negotiate.<eos> That's the feminine side, Ma.<eos> It was always gonna be war, them knowing Rye was dead.<eos> Killing him, I mean.<eos> I want this butcher dead.<eos> In Luverne.
Hon?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Are we are out of coffee?<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> Did you...<eos> You weren't in bed, so I--<eos> I know.<eos> I was just thinkin'.<eos> What?
Yeah.<eos> He's not the butcher.<eos> More the assistant butcher, though that's gonna change, I think.<eos> Buying the place.<eos> Uh, you need to...<eos> He's in the back.<eos> Buzz him for you.<eos> Oh, hey. I read that.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Last year.
What's that? A recording' device, son.<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Hey! Look, you get these Kansas City boys to impugn themselves on tape, and I'll talk to the D.A. about pleading' you out on lesser charges.<eos> Well, I want it in writin'.<eos> Meanwhile, at the crossroads separating Minnesota from South Dakota, a different kind of betrayal was taking place.<eos> Yes, sir, I do think that sounds strange.<eos> Mike Milligan, the low-level enforcer for the Kansas City Mafia, was playing a dangerous game.<eos> Just hours earlier, he had been targeted for execution, but he had turned the tables on his killers.<eos> Well, they never showed up.<eos> And now, in a desperate gambit...
They're coming!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> They're...<eos> When we reach the motel, I want you in the vehicle.<eos> Make sure you're safe.<eos> Hanzee'll stay, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> I miss them all.<eos> We'll be together again.<eos> On high.
We're not meant to have more than we can handle, is what I mean.<eos> So, this need for conquest, you know, trying to own things that aren't meant to be owned...<eos> Like people?<eos> That's an example.<eos> But also places. Believing we can tame things.<eos> That's a problem, right?<eos> Not a solution.<eos> You're saying capitalism is a problem?<eos> No.<eos> Greed.
Kansas City runs most of their dope through an outfit called Legit Truckin' out of Cincinnati.<eos> My information is they hide it in the tires.<eos> Here in town, they store their gak in two different places.<eos> There's a nail salon on Robertson. And an auto repair shop on First.<eos> And check the air pump inside.<eos> Also, I hear they got weapons stashed on the roof.<eos> Hello.<eos> The Undertaker's coming.<eos> You're done.<eos> Okay?
In the beginning, a star fell from heaven and changed us.<eos> Made us angels and gave us a new destiny:<eos> to stop the Apocalypse and the Devil himself.<eos> We must pass God's test and prove humanity is still worth saving.<eos> For we are the Messengers.<eos> Previously on The Messengers...

"and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth."<eos> It says a third of all people on the Earth will be killed after the Horsemen unite.<eos> That's two billion people.<eos> You look tired, Josh.<eos> Did you sleep last night?<eos> No.<eos> Who could sleep with all the terrible things that are about to happen?<eos> I mean, it's prophecy.<eos> It's all... it's all written right here.<eos> On paper.
I need you to help me find that missing meteor, because...<eos> I think it's somehow connected to this.<eos> The license plates are U.S. Government.<eos> The van could be at any number of installations.<eos> My cousin's working on narrowing the list.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I just don't want to see you get hurt.<eos> I mean... because, believe it or not, beneath these rugged good looks is just a regular guy that actually cares a lot about you.<eos> Yeah, 'cause I would definitely call you rugged.<eos> Well, in a certain light.

Today's schedule has been changed.<eos> All women are to come to the women's hall immediately.<eos> You heard, everyone to the women's hall now.<eos> Move it!<eos> Doro.<eos> Shhh.<eos> How did you and your fiance meet?<eos> You mean Dieter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mixed parade.
I'm just a retard.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> It's all fenced in, the entire compound.<eos> They even have spring guns.<eos> I almost got killed, when I tried to get away.<eos> When was that?<eos> About three months ago.<eos> That's why you weren't there.<eos> Where?<eos> Men's gathering.
Of course I tried to call you, Elijah, but since Dahlia was able to take down both Klaus and Mikael, I am guessing that a cell phone tower was a piece of cake.<eos> And where were the wolves who stood guard?<eos> Getting their asses handed to them by Dahlia just like Klaus did.<eos> That's it.<eos> You're coming with me to the compound.<eos> Where Dahlia sent Josephine this morning.<eos> We'd be sitting ducks just like we will be here as soon as that spell breaks, which is why we have to go.<eos> Jackson is out getting supplies, and then we're taking the wolves, and we're headed to the bayou.<eos> The swamp, so my child can be protected by the very wolves Dahlia so easily defeated?<eos> Absolutely not.
Whenever I looked in your eyes, I saw your mother, the sister who turned my heart to stone...<eos> And with that stone, I will crush every one of her children.<eos> Isn't there a saying about stones and glass houses?<eos> In case the analogy is lost on you, I believe my brother is calling you a hypocritical bitch.<eos> Hmm, bringing vampires to a witch fight.<eos> Someone hasn't learned their lesson.<eos> Well, I can be a bit thick sometimes...<eos> Although on this occasion, I'd say I took your lesson to heart.<eos> My sister...<eos> In chains.
Stay by your side.<eos> When I saw my children willing to fight for one another, dear sister, it is only now that I realize my more grievous sin...<eos> Not standing by you.<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> Oh...<eos> Of course I forgive you.<eos> Seems we're officially orphans.<eos> The spoils of war, hey?<eos> A family tradition.<eos> Minus the family.
My name is Oliver Queen.<eos> After five years in hell, I have come home with only one goal-- to save my city.<eos> Now others have joined my crusade.<eos> To them, I'm Oliver Queen.<eos> To the rest of Starling City, I am someone else.<eos> I am...something else.<eos> Previously, on "Arrow"...

I just want to understand.<eos> I want to know what drives a man to do what you do, to ruin other men's lives.<eos> Want my watch?<eos> Here.<eos> Take it because you've already taken everything from me.<eos> You're not gonna shoot me.<eos> I bet you've never even held a gun before.<eos> Go back to your rich neighborhood.<eos> Is it safe?<eos> Safer than a boat.
I'll shoot out the glass.<eos> You get in and find the Alpha.<eos> We won't have much time once we breach.<eos> Two minutes max before the alarms draw attention.<eos> Head directly for the lab.<eos> We'll be right behind you.<eos> You ok?<eos> Waller said when we get this done, she'll get Tatsu back.<eos> She's lying.<eos> On the move!
On the move!<eos> 30 seconds.<eos> Copy that.<eos> I've got eyes on the target warehouse.<eos> But no signs of life.<eos> Felicity, you seeing something I don't?<eos> The warehouse doesn't have any security cameras, but someone disabled all the traffic cams on that block, which probably means you're in the right place.<eos> You sure ditching the arrow suit was a good idea?<eos> Only if I need to move or shoot.<eos> In position.
You merely think you did.<eos> Surrender or die.<eos> Hey, Oliver.<eos> Oliver, what's going on?<eos> If any of you speak, we're all gonna die. - What?<eos> - I need you to trust me.<eos> Stir the grass and you startle the snake.<eos> My ruse with the plane was meant to reveal any traitors among me.<eos> How did you know of the virus?<eos> Of the plane?
My name is Oliver Queen.<eos> After five years in hell, I have come home with only one goal... To save my city.<eos> Now others have joined my crusade.<eos> To them, I'm Oliver Queen.<eos> To the rest of starling city, I am someone else.<eos> I am... Something else.<eos> Previously, on "Arrow"...
I should really be recording this.<eos> I started all of this because of my father,<eos> To... Right his wrongs.<eos> It became<eos> Something more.<eos> But I never stopped to think about it<eos> Or about why...<eos> Until you asked me to.<eos> And what was the answer?<eos> Tonight at the precinct,
My name is Oliver Queen.<eos> After five years in hell,<eos> I have come home with only one goal-- to save my city.<eos> Now others have joined my crusade.<eos> To them, I am Oliver Queen.<eos> To the rest of Starling City, I am someone else.<eos> I am something else.<eos> Previously, on "Arrow"...
During the surgery to remove the arrow, you developed a thrombus.<eos> A blood clot.<eos> If left untreated, it could cause an ischemic stroke.<eos> Well, then maybe we should treat it.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> Your injuries have left you very weak.<eos> A craniotomy could end up doing more harm than good.<eos> And by harm, you mean...<eos> Brain damage, at best.<eos> At worst...
Nice to see you again...<eos> Ms. Queen.<eos> You ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's unhurt.<eos> I have no desire to kill either of you.<eos> This time tomorrow, two bodies will be found in Starling City, burned beyond any recognition.<eos> With ample evidence that Oliver and Thea Queen have been killed in some horrible accident.<eos> I'm going to leave you, kid, the same way you left me.<eos> Alone in Purgatory.
You have Chen Na Wei.<eos> It's over.<eos> I'm sorry to say, that's not up to either one of us.<eos> This him?<eos> General Matthew Shrieve.<eos> You've done your country quite a service today, Mr. Queen.<eos> That said, I've got some news you're not going to want to hear.<eos> Well, General, I'm used to that by now.<eos> We're going to need to debrief you.<eos> Back in China.
Good enough.<eos> Just remember-- that was without arrows.<eos> Get down, on the floor!<eos> All right, turn this place inside out.<eos> We know how this guy loves his secret hiding places.<eos> Hey, Frank.<eos> What brings you out of your downtown office?<eos> The Chief of D's asked me to have a word with you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What about?
Ok, let's go.<eos> Felicity...<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right, yeah, got 'em.<eos> I don't know, we'll talk about that later.<eos> I need all units.<eos> I need ESU, all squad cars converging on these four locations.<eos> We got a potential bioweapons attack.<eos> I'm onsite.<eos> Onsite. Onsite.
I'm not asking you to.<eos> I'll think on it.<eos> Ok.<eos> John.<eos> If you're going to keep going, you may want to find a way to conceal your identity when you're out there.<eos> I'll think on that, too.<eos> You be well, Oliver.<eos> You, too.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Kumamoto.
I'll think on that, too.<eos> You be well, Oliver.<eos> You, too.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Kumamoto.<eos> There's a monastery there near my childhood home.<eos> I had always hoped to show it to Akio when we returned to Japan as a family.<eos> I'm so very sorry, Tatsu.<eos> And where will you go?<eos> Back to Starling City?
See, I believe he allowed himself to be accused so as to be ruled out as a suspect in the future.<eos> And your proof is... X-ray vision?<eos> Digital images can be fabricated, and I can't go to a judge with any of that.<eos> What about my statement?<eos> You mean your uncorroborated testimony?<eos> You're protecting him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Because you and Oliver are old friends.<eos> You, uh, hurt yourself signing depositions?<eos> At the gym, actually.
To Floyd Lawton.<eos> Prochnost.<eos> Any luck finding your imposter?<eos> Still out there.<eos> Oliver, we have to stop this guy before he puts arrows in any more criminals.<eos> Or...before he starts putting them in innocent people.<eos> Madame Mayor, I have it on good authority that he's been set up.<eos> Hold on a second, Ray.<eos> Now you're telling me you think the Arrow is innocent?<eos> Of these murders, yes.
Side to side, side to side. Side...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> "A moment of happiness, you and I..." "..sitting on the veranda.<eos> "Apparently two, but one in soul. "We feel the flowing water of life here, you and I.<eos> "With the garden's beauty and the birds singing.<eos> "The stars will be watching us, and we will show them "what it is to be a thin crescent moon.<eos> "You and I unselfed will be together, "indifferent to idle speculation.<eos> - "You and I..."<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> "..in one form upon this earth "and in another form in a timeless, sweet land."
- Come with us, please.<eos> - Here's the thing...<eos> - Not a choice.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Can you do this?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sir, are you okay?<eos> You're sweating.<eos> It's 118 degrees.<eos> Outside.
I know.<eos> What about new products?<eos> Any beauty creams? Night masks?<eos> I don't night mask.<eos> Right, of course.<eos> You just wake up like that, naturally flawless.<eos> In terms of your sexual history, anything recent...<eos> Um... you know what, I really think it's this new shampoo I'm using.<eos> I'm gonna get a drink.<eos> At the Dal.
Jack: Important question.<eos> Have I ever lied to you?<eos> Maybe, maybe not, I do know you've been creative.<eos> Creative.<eos> Hm. How so?<eos> You left your cell without telling me.<eos> I thought we agreed I was gonna give you a little space.<eos> And you said so yourself... that box couldn't hold me.<eos> Bo, has he lied to you about anything that truly matters.<eos> The past.
I'm not.<eos> Just... stop.<eos> Okay?<eos> Mom, whatever you are planning, it's dangerous.<eos> You're going to get yourself killed.<eos> But we... we came up with the plan together.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> When you came to see me!<eos> Where? !<eos> At the institution.
When I was a child, I saw my mother Killed by something impossible.<eos> - Run, barry, run!<eos> - My father went to prison for her murder.<eos> Then an accident made me the impossible.<eos> To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, But secretly, I use my speed To fight crime and find others like me.<eos> And one day, I'll find who killed my mother...<eos> - Mom!<eos> - And get justice for my father.<eos> I am the flash.<eos> Previously on the flash...
Stay with michelle obama.<eos> If the indians see your ginger hair, They'll think you're a witch, which you probably are.<eos> Moto!<eos> Almond: A few years ago, I was part of a task force.<eos> We were hunting down human traffickers.<eos> We chased them to cooch county, where I ran into blue backstrom.<eos> Said, "rattlesnakes can tell the enemy's coming "by their vibration.<eos> You guys are shaking like an overloaded washing machine."<eos> Well, while we debated what to do next, Blue and one other deputy busted the entire ring.<eos> The old-fashioned cowboy way.
A design engineer for klamath electronics. They specialize in communication systems.<eos> Did he like her?<eos> Well, his graduation quote was,<eos> "s.W. -- Leaving your orbit Is like making earth say goodbye to the sun."<eos> He realllikes her.<eos> No mention of him in her quote.<eos> Hellman: I definitely know her.<eos> I thought about nothing else for almost four years.<eos> When's the last time you talked to her?<eos> Uh -- um... High school.
This have something to do with the case?<eos> One of these kids is nephew to the tribe's chief.<eos> He got in trouble in my county, And I'm returning him to be tried by his own people.<eos> They got a volunteer thing here.<eos> Yeah, the peace-giving courts.<eos> Do you believe in restorative justice?<eos> I don't much trust our system.<eos> They can't do worse.<eos> You won't mind if I tell the lieutenant, would you?<eos> Not at all.
You should pitch John Grisham that story for his next novel.<eos> - Harold, be nice.<eos> - Um, actually, George has had some exciting new career opportunities.<eos> He's managing the...<eos> Hardened criminals.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There was a, uh...<eos> There was a murder case, actually.<eos> A murder?<eos> In BlueBell?
Lemon?<eos> Lemon, are you in there?<eos> - Zoe?<eos> Zoe?<eos> - Lemon!<eos> Where's Zoe?<eos> Zoe!<eos> Oh, thank heavens!<eos> You're okay!<eos> Oh, God!
You talk to her?<eos> Not really.<eos> She said hi once or twice.<eos> Blood trail.<eos> Let's just say I admired her from afar, her curvaciousness and so forth.<eos> But when I saw her all laid out in the dirt like that, I thought, "that's bad," so I called the police.<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> We just found our murder weapon.<eos> That your shovel, Norman?<eos> Mostly mine.
Helping you.<eos> Larissa's not a hooker.<eos> She's a licensed sex surrogate.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> And what's your sexual problem?<eos> Dmitri only gets aroused by a princess.<eos> Well, you look like a princess.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> But not me.<eos> Dmitri.
What's that?<eos> "Bristophil..." love of criminals?<eos> It says, "she enjoys sex "only with men who have committed acts of outrage, cheating, lying, theft, and assault."<eos> Mm. In France, we'd say she likes men from Marseille.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Backstrom here?<eos> Sorry to interrupt you giving yourself cancer.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> What about?
I mean, why did he come here to America?<eos> It's a red flag.<eos> I mean, this Hodiak kid, he could be here to suss out the movement, for someone.<eos> Inform on us.<eos> I don't think that's what's happening.<eos> Well, let's just say that you have interest in the subject but maybe not as much knowledge as is possible.<eos> I spoke to a friend. About Walt.<eos> He's in the movement.<eos> - The what?<eos> - The anti-war movement.
Since she called and invited herself.<eos> Well she's your mom, you can't... you can't be alone with her?<eos> Just beautiful, aren't you?<eos> I know, I think she's got my eyes.<eos> Mm-hmm. But that high yellow, that came from her daddy.<eos> I ought to put her down for a nap.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> You okay?<eos> You okay?
How about assault when he was in college?<eos> - Against a woman?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, getting into a bar fight when you're in college is a lot different from pulping your girlfriend.<eos> Well, say for a second he's not as good a man as you think he is.<eos> I don't think he's good for anything but my wallet when I bet the Rams.<eos> Now if she's not testifying, you got nothing.<eos> It's he said/she said and she's not saying.<eos> When will Emma be home?<eos> This week.
My name is Liv Moore, and I died, sort of.<eos> I had a promising career and a great fiancé.<eos> Then I went to the world's worst boat party and got turned into a zombie.<eos> Now I work at the morgue for access to brains, but brain eating has side effects.<eos> I take on the victim's personality traits and have visions which I use to help solve their murders.<eos> I work with a detective who thinks I'm a psychic and my boss, the medical examiner, the only person who knows my secret.<eos> I'm a crime-fighting zombie.<eos> Previously on iZombie...
I wanna thank Don Watts and Freddy Brown for helping to find my husband's killer.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, that is Wally Walker's widow.<eos> And, uh, that eye candy is Walker's angel investor.<eos> He offered a reward for any information leading to the killer's arrest.<eos> Oh, and, uh, that compelling fellow is Freddy Brown.<eos> He collected the reward.<eos> Wait for it.<eos> Oh, my God! It's you!<eos> In your power suit!
Angela's by resistant to advice on financial matters.<eos> She's resistant to everything.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, um, you know, who knows what she'll say?<eos> She hasn't said anything to you, has she?<eos> About what?<eos> Well, about...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Um, investments or...
All right, so how'd you get him to talk?<eos> - Was it the cheeseburger?<eos> - I think it was more my sympathy.<eos> - For his hand?<eos> - Well, not just that, but also the suffering that he endures because of his condition.<eos> You know, maybe if I indulge his delusion and show compassion for his experience of being a man who turns into a wolf, he might feel safe enough to endure talking about the hunter and not trigger his fear response.<eos> Great!<eos> Do that upstairs.<eos> All the nests are within 300 yards of streets.<eos> Two commercial, one residential.
- You're a student at U.N.H.<eos> - Michael...<eos> You were taking the bus home and you got kicked off in Boston.<eos> We've contacted your family, and they're on their way.<eos> Thank you, Maura.<eos> Maura.<eos> - How are you?<eos> I feel like I know what you're gonna say, and it starts with "I've been thinking."<eos> I have.<eos> Uh-huh. About human cell division.
Don't thank me. Just bring us results.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Pierce at 6:00.<eos> Mr. Prime Minister.<eos> Walter, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> The President ordered you to stay in New Delhi.<eos> Your air strike's on hold.<eos> My guy Haroon Raja's got the ball, and he's at the one-yard line.<eos> - You don't know, do you?<eos> - What?
Soul of discretion.<eos> We're still in shock.<eos> Archie was one of the finest men I ever met.<eos> Do you know what happened?<eos> Only what we read in the paper - that he drowned.<eos> I wonder what he was doing at the lake.<eos> I don't know, it was a warm day.<eos> He probably just wanted to cool off.<eos> Did he live nearby?<eos> Little Haydock.
Stop it.<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> Big fucking problem here, dude.<eos> - We are so fucking fucked.<eos> - Okay, what's happened?<eos> So John boy, your brother, pulls me in and he starts asking me these questions, okay?<eos> What--?<eos> What questions?<eos> About what?<eos> Mostly about you.
- Sally, why don't you sit down?<eos> - I don't wanna sit down.<eos> - Danny's got himself into something, Mom.<eos> - What is that supposed to mean?<eos> He's involved in something where he's gonna get into a lot of trouble.<eos> Oh, did you catch him smoking grass?<eos> Because, you know, he smoked some with me.<eos> That's not the issue, Sally.<eos> - He's been lying to you, lying to me--<eos> - About what?
- Billy, leave.<eos> - Right.<eos> - See you, Billy.<eos> - Mr. Secretary.<eos> I didn't expect you home.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Nuclear crisis.<eos> Walter, you and I need to discuss something.<eos> What?<eos> Billy?
- See you, Billy.<eos> - Mr. Secretary.<eos> I didn't expect you home.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Nuclear crisis.<eos> Walter, you and I need to discuss something.<eos> What?<eos> Billy?<eos> You know I'm fine with that.<eos> No, not Billy.
And on a personal note, I want you to know, this whole experience has made me feel weirdly closer to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I'm not sure what you mean.<eos> I mean, with everything that's going on with the baby... you're sort of family now.<eos> What baby?<eos> And who the hell are you, anyway?<eos> So, let me get this straight.<eos> You want to keep the girls here, and then let Raja come in and parade them around on TV, and turn them into political pawns?<eos> It's a little more complicated than that.<eos> But, yeah, pretty much.
I can't do what I do without caring.<eos> I'm not a doctor.<eos> Can we ease up a little, please?<eos> Could I have a word with you, please?<eos> In private?<eos> Coop just gave me his two weeks' notice.<eos> Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> He said he had a conversation with you that was a real eye-opener.<eos> Did you tell him your little tale about the Icelandic condominiums?<eos> Norwegian?
- Yes. That's great.<eos> You are looking at the new Upper East Side rep for Illyria.<eos> Pain management without all that pesky constipation.<eos> You're a pharma-babe?<eos> Yeah, don't I have the look?<eos> And remind me to go to a meeting in the morning.<eos> Sure thing, but first we have to call your drug dealer.<eos> Yeah. ( inhales )<eos> So, is there anything I should know about this guy?<eos> Who, Gabe?
- Nothing. - Mm.<eos> Résumés?<eos> This about the job hunt?<eos> - Job hunt. How is it going?<eos> - It's not.<eos> Nobody wants to hire a woman of a certain age.<eos> They want to hire a 22-year-old.<eos> Well, statistically speaking, that's not true.<eos> Although some jobs do require more youthful employees, I think if you just expand your universe to just ...<eos> Really?
We'll be safe in here as long as we have...<eos> Where is my shield?<eos> It was right here.<eos> Wow.<eos> Your level of uselessness never ceases to amaze me.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Where do you think I'm going?<eos> To get my shield back.<eos> It was stolen at the party because someone thought it'd be a great idea to hang it on the wall.<eos> In plain sight!
Where else could she be?<eos> Mark, you need to think.<eos> Where could she be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She's looking for you.<eos> Think.<eos> I don't know, I...<eos> We used to hang out at the Dal.<eos> She liked to watch me box.<eos> At the gym?
I'm a detective with Boston P.D. Uh, do you live here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm looking for a Ronald Wallace.<eos> You might know him as Alan.<eos> - Alan.<eos> - So you know him?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's my husband.<eos> Who gets to plan the funeral?<eos> Her or me?
MAN: 2-Tom-7 at shooter one residence.<eos> All clear.<eos> Two bedrooms, seven rooms total... nobody home.<eos> DISPATCH: Copy that.<eos> Maker residence is clear.<eos> Stand by.<eos> Third floor clear.<eos> Single resident.<eos> Diploma says "Dr. Rentman."<eos> First floor clear.
Sir, we don't know anything, and the reason why no one's answering the phones is because this entire department is involved in a manhunt to try and find this psychopathic mass murderer who's now loose in the city.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know this is hard.<eos> Just... just promise me you'll call as soon as you hear anything.<eos> We will.<eos> We got to find this goddamn kid.<eos> Oh, geez.<eos> All right, let's go around back.<eos> How is he?<eos> Alive.
Matches his online gaming profile from the Xbox we pulled at his home.<eos> - So, you're saying he RSVP'd?<eos> - Correct.<eos> - All right, how many people we got here?<eos> - [scoffs] 200, 300.<eos> 300 drug-addled teenagers.<eos> Who, for all we know, view this punk as a hero.<eos> Look, every second we spend out here while he's in there, more lives are at risk.<eos> Okay. How many plainclothes we got?<eos> Um, 10 in each station, 80 total.
- I'm not a chauffeur. - Hm?<eos> Well, it's your hands on the wheel.<eos> Seth?<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Registration and insurance, please.<eos> I'm sorry, officer.<eos> I left my wallet at work.<eos> Registration?<eos> Proof of insurance?<eos> - In my wallet.
What are you doing here, sweetie?<eos> May I introduce my daughter, Lena...<eos> It's breakfast in bed, and dinner downstairs.<eos> It's a family business, we want to keep a certain atmosphere.<eos> Catherette will make the beds, and give it a go with the...<eos> If it's all right with you.<eos> - Absolutely. Madame...<eos> - Same with me.<eos> - And your luggage?<eos> - In the car.
I passed a car park, I'll see to the car and get my stuff.<eos> I'd like to take a walk in the forest.<eos> Is there a way through the back?<eos> Certainly, Sir.<eos> The gate is straight ahead, through the garden.<eos> I've put some towels in the bathroom.<eos> Shit, it's going to rain.<eos> There was a bird, hanged.<eos> - Hanged, how?<eos> - From blue string.
Rain, that?<eos> Ha!<eos> A burn.<eos> Tell me the story of "The Red and Black".<eos> You sure?<eos> A burn<eos> And Julien shoots Madame de Rênal who he'd seduced at the beginning, remember?<eos> He kills her?<eos> - He wounds her in a church.<eos> - Why a church?
- Shakespeare!<eos> Even more severe.<eos> Who wasn't at the meal?<eos> - Catherette.<eos> - See, I told you.<eos> The order is being born before our eyes.<eos> And the shape.<eos> - Intellectual, your thriller!<eos> - Sartre's "Words".<eos> - About what?
The blade was on the other side.<eos> And there, these three pebbles, and these few blades of grass, and here, this clothes peg.<eos> Someone makes a sort of rhyme towards Catherette.<eos> Shaped like a triangle directed at the axe, to confirm the axe.<eos> At this rate, you'll have nothing to put on.<eos> So your thriller, how's it going?<eos> It vanishes in radishes.<eos> Tonight I'm going into town, coming?<eos> If I don't pass this exam, my father will kill me.<eos> - In your book...
Only this morning...<eos> What a shock for you...<eos> I never thought anyone...<eos> No one, anyone...<eos> What do you think?<eos> - No idea?<eos> - Where's the idea in hanging a cat!<eos> And you, dear, dear, wouldn't you know?<eos> Who, where, how? How?<eos> With this string.
Fifteen minutes of infinity, blackjack in a life where nothing's free.<eos> God almighty, merciful God...<eos> The devil take me if I forget this one.<eos> Your flights of fancy, Leon.<eos> What a charming excursion.<eos> Father, did you hitchhike?<eos> - Where to?<eos> - A sandwich?<eos> - Same as us.<eos> To the sea.
These are not good walking shoes.<eos> Does it not inconvenience you to take the priest in your car?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> - Oh come.<eos> Aren't you waiting for me?<eos> Y a de la joie!<eos> - Something begins to form.<eos> - What?<eos> The embryo of the whole.<eos> Just like "Nausea".
Who have squeezed out every ounce of human decency In order to fit in those dresses, And who care more about society secrets<eos> [ women gasping ] [ sighs ] [ slurps ]<eos> Give them nothing but fatty foods and tap water.<eos> They'll talk.<eos> [ women murmuring ]<eos> These mahjong women sit together On the boards of non-profits, Attend each other's charitable fundraisers, et cetera.<eos> And our victim, vanessa taymor's, pet charity Is the homeless.<eos> "literacy, women's issues, cancer, parks beautification."<eos> Backstrom told you to arrest all of them?<eos> On what grounds?
Right before he died, he got a message sent to his ZoGo app saying that his ride was canceled because he was a no-show.<eos> Guys, if he wasn't in a ZoGo, where was he?<eos> Ghost car.<eos> Our target hacked the app.<eos> Diverted all the data onto his cell phone. Masqueraded as a ZoGo driver.<eos> Cade got in his car thinking it was a real ZoGo.<eos> You know, ZoGo has made it socially acceptable to just get in the car with a stranger.<eos> At least taxis are regulated.<eos> There's accountability.<eos> No, not with this app.
Nice to meet you.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Just because I drove a black car doesn't mean I'm guilty.<eos> You're right, it doesn't.<eos> What makes you guilty is your<eos> I.P. address was used to send a phishing e-mail.<eos> Your motive is your cab company's been hemorrhaging clients to ZoGo.<eos> We found two bodies in your area of operation.<eos> You're looking at a double homicide.<eos> "A double homicide"?
I don't need anyone's help.<eos> I am the Morrigan.<eos> Or I was...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I said don't touch me.<eos> Why didn't you just turn me Fae when you had the chance?<eos> Because I wanted to test the serum.<eos> To make sure it was safe.<eos> Evony: Test it?<eos> On who?
Danny Rayburn.<eos> Yeah?<eos> That's me.<eos> Wayne Lowry wanted me to come see you.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> My good old buddy Wayne.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> He's a bit nervous.<eos> He wants to know if his property is secure.<eos> Secure?
Be smart and get out of town.<eos> Is that what this is all about?<eos> You just want me gone.<eos> You don't care whether anything happens to me?<eos> Hey, it's not my problem.<eos> Not your fucking problem.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're no longer my fucking problem, Danny.<eos> Wanna know when that happened?<eos> For real?
What's going on?<eos> What's going on in your world?<eos> Actually...<eos> - I'm taking a trip.<eos> - Really?<eos> Cool.<eos> I need a vacation myself.<eos> - I'm gonna stay at my sister's...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - ...in Orlando.
In the beginning, a star fell from heaven and changed us.<eos> Made us angels and gave us a new destiny:<eos> to stop the Apocalypse and the Devil himself.<eos> We must pass God's test and prove humanity is still worth saving.<eos> For we are the Messengers.<eos> Previously on The Messengers...

There are corrupt forces aligned against us, plaguing our system... their greed is an infection, a virus.<eos> Join us and be a part of the cure.<eos> Are you hearing the kind of language he's using?<eos> Plague, infection, virus.<eos> If you ask me, he sounds like he could be the Horseman of Pestilence.<eos> What's so great about the great outdoors?<eos> - What, you don't like camping?<eos> - Well, that depends.<eos> You want to share a sleeping bag?<eos> - Hi.
Yeah.<eos> It's kind of hard to have faith in anything when you don't know where you come from.<eos> Maybe for now it's enough to know where you belong.<eos> You sure this is gonna work?<eos> It worked last time I lost my phone.<eos> Funny story, actually.<eos> I met a girl at a UFO convention in Vegas last year, and somehow my phone wound up stuck in her...<eos> Great. Story.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Suitcase.
Well... her name is Margaret.<eos> She had leukemia.<eos> She came to us about a year ago after Nero Health repeatedly denied her claims for a bone marrow transplant.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> Well, we did everything we could for her, but without that transplant, she didn't have many options.<eos> After Nero Health denied her claim for the final time, her son Leland decided he'd take her home and take care of her himself.<eos> What else can you tell us about him?<eos> Oh, he was a quiet boy.<eos> He seemed troubled.<eos> How so?

What do you mean, "others?"<eos> There's more, mommy.<eos> Drill has lots of friends.<eos> I miss you, daddy.<eos> I miss you, too, sweetheart.<eos> How's everything there?<eos> You and your mommy having a good day?<eos> I guess so.<eos> Where are you?<eos> At work.

It's... it's like...<eos> A pull.<eos> Like one of your visions?<eos> No, this is different.<eos> This is like something is grabbing me from the pit of my stomach and pulling.<eos> When did it start?<eos> Last night.<eos> I haven't... I haven't felt like this since, uh...<eos> Since the desert.<eos> Not since Mali.
- Are you all right?<eos> - Perfectly!<eos> - I thought you were lying down.<eos> I needed some air!<eos> Do you have to monitor my every breath? !<eos> I'm going to change.<eos> I need a bloody drink.<eos> - God damn it all, woman, stop fussing me!<eos> Trouble in paradise?<eos> Paradise?
Then come away with me.<eos> My offer still stands.<eos> I have means for both of us.<eos> You needn't be at his beck and call ever again.<eos> I can't.<eos> I know you think he murdered his wife.<eos> Why else would you make such a ludicrous confession?<eos> Stay here when you could be next?<eos> Or the house by the sea you've always yearned for?<eos> Devon or Cornwall.
I've no doubt they will.<eos> But I'd rather stick to the evidence.<eos> So let's just wait and see if your fingerprints match the ones we found in the attic.<eos> Shouldn't take long.<eos> In the meantime, I've requested a warrant to search the caravans.<eos> What are you expecting to find?<eos> I'll know when I've found it.<eos> "Dear Larry..."<eos> Yes, I did correct her.<eos> Rather charming, really.
!<eos> We had no idea that was happening!<eos> Oh, we got to get through that bucket list fast.<eos> After the doc heals up Chicken, we're gonna go confront that bear - that's been giving us dirty looks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I'm gonna learn how to read!<eos> A chicken will be sent to bed, a city street will run blood red.<eos> - Red? !<eos> You mean, red with blood?<eos> - Like in The Shining?
Crickett, what were you thinking?<eos> !<eos> Whipping the Pritchetts all up into a lather?<eos> !<eos> I was trying to give them the chance to make amends before, poof, we can't!<eos> It is not the end of the world, Crickett.<eos> Maybe not, but AB's dream was a wake-up call.<eos> It's time to make amends before it's too late.<eos> And you know who I can't stop thinking about?<eos> Who?
Chicken!<eos> No, Chicken, I already told you, you need to go home and rest!<eos> Dr. Breeland, you just sent a Chicken to bed!<eos> No, no.<eos> Wanda, no.<eos> I said...<eos> I said he needed to rest.<eos> - Well, where is he gonna rest?<eos> ! Bed!<eos> - The couch!
The candles last for two hours.<eos> Annabeth's waiting for me.<eos> - Right, okay<eos> - Okay.<eos> Frank.<eos> This is for the ticket you bought me to Basic Instinct - back in 92.<eos> - Oh, thanks, Delma.<eos> See you on the other side, hopefully.<eos> Hey, AB, where's George?<eos> Oh, on his way.
I mean, charging someone to talk to you so you can tell them to talk to each other?<eos> It's a little harsh?<eos> Your wife would certainly think so.<eos> You've got a reminder on your desk from your wife.<eos> The time is underlined three times.<eos> No one underlines something three times unless someone else has forgotten it two times.<eos> You want to avoid the counselor, tell your wife you love her.<eos> Everything else is secondary.<eos> I don't know that anything's that simple.<eos> Especially marriage...
Recalculating.<eos> Come back.<eos> Dutch, say again.<eos> I said there's some kind of barricade.<eos> Signs of a fight.<eos> - Guys, we're not alone! - I ain't sure if you guys can hear this, but I found the transponder, and it's...<eos> There's no planet of origin info, there's no serial numbers, it's blank.<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm in pursuit!<eos> Lower level!
It wasn't a trick, it was a message.<eos> - Here's another...<eos> Get out.<eos> - Can't. - I could make you.<eos> - Oh, that would be fun, but not today.<eos> Today, I need you.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> In my ship?<eos> In my head?
Chicago, 1995,<eos> Grateful Dead's last hurrah.<eos> Jerry was about to drop, but he just kept on wailing.<eos> I was so stoned.<eos> I remember eating a whole apple pie.<eos> We're almost there.<eos> You doing okay?<eos> Mm, you could stick that fucker in my eyeball if it'll buy me another six months.<eos> So, uh, how long have you known about...<eos> My glioblastoma?
I am so sorry for what I put you through.<eos> I'm dropping out of grad school.<eos> You're what?<eos> Just because I suck at it.<eos> I spend all day firing people and doing bullshit paperwork and fucking pee tests and fucking worrying about everybody else.<eos> When I get back to my apartment, I just want to hide under the covers and listen to really sad Adele songs.<eos> So basically all of them.<eos> I haven't turned in a paper for the last three weeks.<eos> I'm just failing.<eos> At everything.
But there was just so much water.<eos> Does water destroy d.N.A.? No.<eos> Worse.<eos> It washes it away.<eos> So you're telling me That everything the water touched is contaminated?<eos> Even if there was d.N.A. On this, We wouldn't be able to prove That is didn't wash onto it from somewhere else.<eos> I-I'd hate to be the one to tell guthrie that Two years of his work went down the drain -- literally.<eos> Oh, wow. Larry, what happened?<eos> There was a fire in the men's room.<eos> In the men's room?
Freeze!<eos> [ brakes screech ] Put it down, mike!<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> He hasn't got the balls to shoot me.<eos> Kid's always been a pussy.<eos> I am not a pussy.<eos> I'm a cop!<eos> You're a cop?<eos> [ chuckles ] in maine.
Previously on "Nurse Jackie"...<eos> With the money you owe me, you're lucky I even showed up today.<eos> If I don't get that money by tomorrow, you're gonna need a new attorney for your nursing license hearing.<eos> Any news on my nursing license?<eos> I haven't forgotten our arrangement, but we have to be patient.<eos> Look at the size of that thing.<eos> How long have you known about...<eos> My glioblastoma?
Go ahead.<eos> She worked three traumas.<eos> Uh, all in the last couple of weeks.<eos> She fucking kicked ass and we saved those people, didn't we?<eos> I'm sure what Dr. Prince means...<eos> I mean she saved their lives.<eos> She jumped in, got her hands dirty.<eos> It was... it was like "MASH."<eos> What a show, am I right?<eos> Not at all like the movie.
Time.<eos> You have the time?<eos> You have a watch.<eos> It's broken.<eos> I don't have the time.<eos> I have a phone that has the time.<eos> A phone?<eos> Yes.<eos> I saw a phone in the kitchen.<eos> In the drawer.
But he did, after all, plead to a serious offense.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know you did your best.<eos> Are you gonna be around, Jon, um, until he... until he goes?<eos> Actually, I'm leaving in a couple of days.<eos> I have other cases.<eos> Of course.<eos> And Amantha and I are...<eos> Taking a step back for a bit, too.<eos> On the personal front.
Now, come with me.<eos> We'll get you kids squared away.<eos> You can call me Mr. Janson.<eos> I run this place.<eos> For us it is a sanctuary, safe from the horrors of the outside world.<eos> You all should think of it as a way station.<eos> Kind of a home between homes.<eos> Watch yourselves.<eos> That mean you're taking us home?<eos> A home of sorts.
I don't know.<eos> Well, we followed you out here, Thomas... and now you're saying that you have no idea where we're going... or what we're doing.<eos> Wait.<eos> Janson said something about people hiding in the mountains.<eos> Some kind of resistance or army.<eos> The Right Arm.<eos> The Right Arm .<eos> If they're really against WICKED, maybe they can help us.<eos> People.<eos> In the mountains.
All right!<eos> Let's go!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Everyone, go.<eos> Go!<eos> Come on.<eos> - Come on! - Aris, come on.<eos> All units, push in!<eos> they're on the top floor!<eos> Top floor!
I'm a doctor.<eos> I swore an oath to find a cure!<eos> No matter the cost.<eos> I just need more time.<eos> More blood.<eos> Hello, Mary.<eos> I hoped we'd meet again.<eos> I'm sorry it had to be under these circumstances.<eos> I'm sorry about a lot of things, too.<eos> But not this.
- Yeah.<eos> Her blood pressure was plummeting.<eos> He did what he had to do.<eos> All right, nice job.<eos> Carrie.<eos> No.<eos> No flowers.<eos> Ah, very liberated.<eos> Did you tell Zoey about our thing?<eos> Uh, secret affair?
I remember...<eos> Beat it!<eos> Beat it, crazy bitch!<eos> Why are you here?<eos> - I do as I wish, little king.<eos> - Entering at night?<eos> 400 times you've opened my door!<eos> Stop spying on us!<eos> I can go where I want.<eos> Not our floor!
That was enough.<eos> Do you want to grab a bite?<eos> I was supposed to meet Ashley, Hanna's mom, for a working lunch, but she just canceled.<eos> It might actually might be nice to talk about Alison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it might.<eos> Oh, there's stuff in the kitchen, if you want to clean.<eos> I can show you.<eos> I know.<eos> In the supply closet.
For real?<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> Hey.<eos> You guys on the clock?<eos> Here to see Christine Waters, 312 Deep Waters Drive.<eos> And will she know what this is about?<eos> Not unless she's psychic.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Deep Waters Drive?<eos> In the desert?
He must have misunderstood.<eos> I said we could get one.<eos> Well, you're here now.<eos> Let's get this over with, whatever this is.<eos> It's about your son, Mrs. Waters.<eos> - Arthur.<eos> How do you know about...<eos> - He's dead.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> Oh, my god.
Call her Elizabeth.<eos> Cancel the jousts.<eos> - He didn't ask how the Queen was.<eos> - Hardly matters now, does it?<eos> I think she was hungry.<eos> My daughter is to live at Hatfield.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think Spanish Mary's household should be broken up.<eos> She can become a member of my daughter's household.<eos> In the capacity of?
But, for now, we cannot wish them away.<eos> All I have, all I own is the ground I stand upon. That ground is Thomas More.<eos> If you want it, you must take it.<eos> I will not yield it.<eos> When you come before the court, throw yourself upon the King's mercy.<eos> He's not a cruel man, you know that.<eos> Do I?<eos> He didn't used to be.<eos> But then he's changed the company he keeps.<eos> Anyway...
No, you don't want to hear about all that.<eos> I do!<eos> Well... ..it wasn't all bad.<eos> In the run-up to D-Day, I went to a tea dance.<eos> And there was the most beautiful girl that I'd ever seen.<eos> She was dancing with another girl and I just knew I had to go up and ask her to dance.<eos> 'She agreed to see me, same time, same place, next week.'<eos> It was the longest week of my life!<eos> Anyway, the time came, and I was there, and I waited and I waited.<eos> Anyway...
Janet, I'll tell you what to ask.<eos> Ask if it's dead.<eos> Are you dead?<eos> I don't want to do it no more.<eos> Janet, Janet.<eos> This is important.<eos> Did you die in this house?<eos> Did you die in this house?<eos> Where?<eos> In that chair?
How's it going, Victor?<eos> It's a good thing I don't pay you by the hour.<eos> Got molasses in my ass, boss.<eos> How we doing?<eos> We're looking good. We're looking good.<eos> I tell you, Simon Stern is taking over the fucking world.<eos> - He sent me out here to get some acquisition contracts signed, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Getting these guys to sign over a percentage of their clubs to him, just like he did me.<eos> - Same shit.
I seem to have mislaid my snuff box.<eos> Kendal Brown is what I generally take, if you have it.<eos> I...<eos> Ow!<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I know this is a... an odd question, but have I...<eos> asked you for anything yet?<eos> Snuff.

A ring of disenchantment?<eos> An urn of visibility?<eos> Show me the object.<eos> I... I have nothing of that sort.<eos> I bought that in Turin.<eos> No, indeed.<eos> And really there does not seem to be anything here - apart from the usual objects - that I would expect to find in the rooms of a magician of your genius.<eos> ~ You make no reply to my suggestion.<eos> ~ Suggestion?<eos> Of an alliance.
I hate what I did.<eos> I hate that I hurt you and I wanna take it back and I wanna make it right.<eos> And I don't even know if I really know what love is you know, except a thing that I fuck up all the time.<eos> But you I respect the shit out of you.<eos> And I miss you.<eos> And all day today when everything in my family is just falling apart I just kept wishing you were with me, and that's what I know.<eos> I just need a couple weeks.<eos> I gotta get Ian settled and get him back on his meds cover my shifts at the diner, but then I can come, at least for a little while.<eos> I can help carry shit and make sandwiches for the guys and...<eos> On tour?

You working?<eos> Yeah, just, uh, some things here and there.<eos> Mmm. I got on with the electricians' union.<eos> Mmm, great.<eos> Still a low man.<eos> You ever miss it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I keep thinking about the village.<eos> Outside Al-Awja.<eos> The valley.
I mean...<eos> I think, like, that was like the... It was the last time shit felt right for me, bro.<eos> You mean combat.<eos> Would you ever go back to it?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Didn't think I'd stay on as long as I did.<eos> And then it was hard to see coming home, you know?<eos> That's not what I mean.<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> Them three days?
Caspere arranged our tax incentives.<eos> Only way you can film anything in California now.<eos> Threw him a co-producer credit.<eos> Real sorry to hear what happened.<eos> Cut.<eos> Was he around here much? Nah.<eos> I mean, he came by.<eos> We were in prep. Helped out with PD, zoning.<eos> That producer credit come with a paycheck?<eos> Back end, yeah.
I don't have any fucking assets.<eos> The house and the poker room were double mortgaged.<eos> This was fucking everything.<eos> That's what you meant.<eos> Frank, why did you...<eos> Leave it.<eos> I'll get it back.<eos> Every dime.<eos> That was maybe a month ago.<eos> September.
I gotta say, being back in here, I don't miss it.<eos> Seems like a headache looking back.<eos> Fucking right, it's a headache.<eos> Vendors, purchase orders, licenses.<eos> Every one of these bitches think that she's Pretty Woman.<eos> I need to know if any of your girls knew a guy, liked young trim.<eos> Maybe, like, a few months ago.<eos> He booked a date at his place.<eos> In Vinci?<eos> The big house?

Month in, month out.<eos> It is a long-term investment in a mutually beneficial relationship.<eos> Then we're settled at five.<eos> All that sugar, Frank,<eos> I wonder you haven't lost your teeth.<eos> Dental work's expensive.<eos> It's the only way I can keep your coffee down.<eos> I never lost a tooth.<eos> Never even had a fucking cavity.<eos> Glove box.
I don't want to talk about any of these things.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My mom, she died when I was 12.<eos> And your mom, who was her doctor?<eos> His name's Pitlor.<eos> My father, he is a very bad person.<eos> I'm sorry, I shouldn't be talking to you.<eos> I just-- I have to go.<eos> I have this memory of her in the sand.<eos> Her big dresses.
Dumb bastard.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> Fuck.<eos> You took it.<eos> How the fuck could you?<eos> Took what, Paulie?<eos> You know what!<eos> The money!
We're not just running some club. Come on.<eos> What's happening now is we are surviving.<eos> All right?<eos> We are rebuilding.<eos> You were almost out of this kind of thing when we met.<eos> It was like you had a design.<eos> That design does not work once someone has stolen all of our money.<eos> The design does not work when I am knee-deep in dirt.<eos> You don't bring a kid into a situation like this.<eos> To what?
- Congratulations. Jeez.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I should, uh-- I should buy you dinner.<eos> Maybe I can reach out to a couple of the girls that I knew before.<eos> For the straight up purpose of getting me into that party, okay?<eos> Aren't you supposed to be behind a desk?<eos> I just started my vacation.<eos> Going anywhere special?<eos> Yep.<eos> Guerneville.
Both of you. Now.<eos> Like, today.<eos> You get somebody to put some of your things together for you.<eos> You don't go back home.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I saved a girl.<eos> She's in the next room coming off of whatever they had her on.<eos> Did they give you something?<eos> Did you go all the way in?<eos> Inside the party?
The Rulfo girl said a policeman paid her to pawn Caspere's stuff.<eos> Look in LAPD service records, all right.<eos> Find out where Holloway was in '92 and who else was in his squad.<eos> Davis is meeting me this afternoon.<eos> I want her to see those signatures in person.<eos> Your sister put me onto you. She said you were missing.<eos> And then this was delivered to her.<eos> Contents of a mailbox you kept.<eos> I need you to look at this stuff.<eos> These pictures.
He was too angry.<eos> He put him out there on the road.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I think he thought it was funny. Caspere was confessing everything. Begging.<eos> He told him about the rail corridor.<eos> He drove around with Ben's body through all those places.<eos> Why'd he leave you like this?<eos> Because I was trying to stop them.<eos> From what?
They're in the bag, too.<eos> The man who wanted to meet, he killed Caspere?<eos> Correct.<eos> One of the Osterman kids.<eos> All grown up.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> In a Vinci landfill.<eos> I got copies of everything.<eos> Something happens to me on the way out, that shit hits the cloud.<eos> News agencies.

Not the Chessani I work for.<eos> Cut the shit, Ray.<eos> Whatever happened in '92 isn't the issue.<eos> You want clear, we put this on Bezzerides.<eos> Geldof is already on board.<eos> No sudden movements, son.<eos> You're public enemy number one.<eos> Don't even need a reason to vaporize you.<eos> Couldn't you have just taken the stones?<eos> Way back?
The former sheriff's deputy and City of Vinci detective was the chief suspect in the murder of a state attorney and a state police investigator.<eos> He was employed as a security consultant at a Vinci casino, which recently burned down.<eos> After a lengthy pursuit, the fugitive engaged a tactical squad of state and city police in a firefight which resulted in his death.<eos> A lot of the rest was in the papers over the next year, if you know where to look.<eos> These facts were paid for in blood.<eos> So honor that.<eos> I don't know if it'll make any difference, but it should. Because we deserve a better world.<eos> And I owe him that.<eos> I owe his sons that.<eos> Anyways,
I'm interested in collusions.<eos> And maybe those parties are where your collusions get sealed.<eos> This is important.<eos> Somebody died here.<eos> Somebody dies every second of the day, and they're not all lucky enough to do it in California.<eos> Ladies, I've been briefed.<eos> I think we've got this now, you don't mind. This connects to a state's missing persons case.<eos> And we'll be happy to share our findings.<eos> You know of any parties get thrown up here?<eos> A lodge a mile back, off the road?
Something didn't close fast, you moved on.<eos> Kids couldn't offer up anything?<eos> They could barely talk.<eos> The girl was maybe four.<eos> Boy, a little older.<eos> Men wore masks.<eos> That's about it.<eos> Ended up in the foster system.<eos> You got kids?<eos> One on the way.
Mischa's.<eos> Did you eat her?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I did not kill her.<eos> The most stable elements, Chiyoh, appear in the middle of the periodic table, roughly between iron and silver.<eos> Between iron and silver... I think that's appropriate for you.<eos> Do we talk about teacups and time and the rules of disorder?<eos> The teacup's broken.<eos> It's never going to gather itself back together again.<eos> Not even in your mind?
He's written a brilliant piece for "The American Journal of Psychiatry".<eos> Everything he writes is about some problem he does not have.<eos> What he's written is going to be your problem.<eos> It's not so much an article as it is a rebuttal.<eos> Hard to believe an inmate's opinion will count for anything in the professional community.<eos> It's going to count, Frederick, and it's going to sting.<eos> You think he would've taken the opportunity to gloat.<eos> He'll have plenty of time to gloat, watching the diaper carts go by.<eos> - So, what did you two talk about?<eos> - The Tooth Fairy.
Huh... You don't wanna let me inside.<eos> I've come too far to let the cold stop me, Will.<eos> Why should the cold stop what common sense couldn't?<eos> - So you don't wanna talk about it here.<eos> - I don't wanna talk about it anywhere.<eos> You've got to talk about it, so let's have it.<eos> Just, er... just don't get out any pictures cos Molly and Walter will be back soon.<eos> How much do you know?<eos> Two families killed in their homes a month apart.<eos> Similar circumstances.
Impossible!<eos> Now I'm certain he's not my son.<eos> He's got bandy legs from biking, and a slight squint that isn't from me.<eos> In my family we look straight ahead.<eos> I did what you asked, now I'm free of it.<eos> If I were you, I'd give Claire a hard time, as she's a serious troublemaker.<eos> I just told you, it's impossible!<eos> That's two slaps.<eos> I warn you, there won't be another!<eos> - All alright?
Like what kind of gifts?<eos> Even a pet snake?<eos> Eww.<eos> But yes, darling, even a pet snake.<eos> Bart. Come on.<eos> It's late.<eos> Jory.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you ever wonder about your dad?<eos> Your real dad?
"Somuch.<eos> "Andtruly, it'stheonlyconsolation ofbeinglocked inthisprisontogether."<eos> "Oneday, whenwe'regrown, "wecanleavethisbehind, "and start a new life together,<eos> "andneverlookback. Happy13thbirthday."<eos> "Love,Chris."<eos> You're so tense.<eos> But massages are good for development.<eos> And you're maturing nicely.<eos> When are you going to tell me about Bart?<eos> My father.
Morning, jory.<eos> Where's Cindy?<eos> Emma took her to the park.<eos> Your mom, uh, is still at the hospital.<eos> Bart's still resting.<eos> Everything okay, son?<eos> Bart say something crazy to you?<eos> About what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> About the family?

We leave here together.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> A gift... from Alexei.<eos> The guards shouldn't have left him for the rats.<eos> Will we see Moscow?<eos> Moscow?<eos> It's a city buried in the past.<eos> We must look to... the future.<eos> America.
- Wouldn't be the first time.<eos> - Oh, don't bullshit me.<eos> A construction company is brick and mortar, literally.<eos> All right, you cannot just shift cranes and trailers and office equipment like you can numbers on a page.<eos> There has to be a trail if everything is being liquidated.<eos> Thanks for the coffee.<eos> What?<eos> So that's it?<eos> Stories like this are built on sources, Miss Page.<eos> Credible sources.
Why are we stopping?<eos> They say the past is etched in stone, but it isn't.<eos> It's... smoke trapped in a closed room, swirling... changing.<eos> Buffeted by the passing of years and wishful thinking.<eos> But even though our perception of it changes, one thing remains constant.<eos> The past can... never be completely erased.<eos> It lingers.<eos> Like the scent of burning wood.<eos> Sir?<eos> Yes, passenger side.
- No, it's the rats.<eos> - The who what now?<eos> They chewed through the main line.<eos> Phone guy's working on it now.<eos> Exterminator's Monday.<eos> We have rats now.<eos> I'm never sleeping here again.<eos> Then there's an upside.<eos> Hey, you guys hear anything on the news about a Russian getting his head cut off?<eos> In Hell's Kitchen?
Vahé, I want to find my son.<eos> I know nothing.<eos> The Turkish ambassador's dead.<eos> To hell with him.<eos> Is Aram involved in this?<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Was he involved in the attack, yes or no?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Beirut.
Remember what you told him?<eos> You said you'd only accept shootings at point blank range.<eos> You!<eos> You love life too much.<eos> I've been dead a long time.<eos> Why is he with your mother?<eos> Fetch him, it's going cold.<eos> Is it true that Gilles set off a bomb?<eos> - Who said that?<eos> - Martha, in school.
Why are we listening to this hooey?<eos> We're analyzing Sebastian's songs through the filter of forensic linguistics.<eos> "Black water, black chains.<eos> Black visions runs through my veins."<eos> See, this song in particular, "black stone," could be about suicide or surrendering to a greater power that he doesn't trust.<eos> And this song might give us insight into his definition of a sanctuary.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Yes, forensic linguistics is a real thing.<eos> No, no.<eos> Penises.
Tom was a wonderful boy.<eos> Always remember that.<eos> Um, see you.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> She came over to apologize.<eos> I heard.<eos> Did you put her up to it?<eos> Yes, 'cause it's my dream to have my wife and the woman I cheated with in the same room, talking.<eos> Where are the girls?<eos> The mall.
A few cowboys wanted to shake your tree.<eos> And, by the way, Cornell's daughter, she is a criminal.<eos> Her father's a shrink.<eos> She stole his prescription pad.<eos> She got pills from pharmacies all over the city and got his license suspended.<eos> Well, so, what are you trying to say...<eos> Cornell was right about her, so she's right about me?<eos> Don't start with the innocence again.<eos> No, man. I'm guilty...<eos> Of plenty.
Well, I'm not like most guys my age.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> So, Mrs. Powell, you'd like to adopt a child.<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> Very much.<eos> [ Metal clinks ] Are you looking for a baby?<eos> A toddler?<eos> An adolescent?<eos> Whatever you have in stock.<eos> In stock?
Hi, Reina.<eos> Y-you're back early.<eos> Reina, why is there a naked man defiling my silk pillow?<eos> Oh, that is my friend...<eos> Mar-Marshall.<eos> Are you wearing my fur?<eos> !<eos> Well, it was a little chilly in here.<eos> [ Gasps ] Reina, I am shocked by your behavior.<eos> Shocked!
Okay. - Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> What?<eos> How pregnant are you?<eos> Two months and change.<eos> How much change?<eos> You think I look bigger?<eos> Well, I'd guess about f-four months.<eos> Or maybe five. [Scoffs]
Come back later. It's... it's... it's... dirty in here.<eos> But it's my house.<eos> Meet me in the library. I'll...<eos> I'll bring you some ice.<eos> This is all your fault!<eos> I'm probably getting fired now!<eos> So, we're not gonna finish?<eos> Get out!<eos> Where did you find these?<eos> In the trash.
You're alive, that's what!<eos> Hallelujah! Spence and miguel are on their way.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Weird.<eos> I hope i can still go on my honeymoon.<eos> What?<eos> It's on saturday.<eos> Rosie, when you got shot, you fell, And you hit your head really hard.<eos> Honey, you've been in a coma.<eos> A-a coma?
Oh, on the contrary.<eos> I'm hoping for a repeat performance.<eos> You think it was the music?<eos> Perhaps a certain food you were eating?<eos> Actually, i met the most fascinating woman.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> I had sex with another woman's erection?<eos> But the orgasm was all yours.<eos> You were thinking about this other woman the whole time?<eos> Not the woman, the pain.
We're right in the middle of book club.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - Okay.<eos> This month, Oprah's got us reading about desegregation in the '60s.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I know!<eos> Me neither! But you go against Oprah, everyone thinks you're a racist.<eos> Gail, you and I are friends, but every day, it gets harder to remember why.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This!
Fine.<eos> You win.<eos> Lovely seeing you, Genevieve.<eos> Aren't you staying?<eos> No, no, no, I just came by to, um... lend Gail a hand.<eos> Carmen?<eos> What is that?<eos> A small token of my appreciation for that miracle you performed on my back earlier.<eos> I am a new man.<eos> Okay, about that, I --
The laundry.<eos> You're 20 minutes early. Well, i figured i'd get a head start on some things.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> Y-- no, i just -- i'm not ready for you -- ouch.<eos> I haven't gotten dressed, and i haven't even put on makeup.<eos> So this is you just rolling out of bed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Uh, you know what? I'll, um, i'll take care of these.<eos> Your panties?
She is.<eos> Marisol, you have a guest!<eos> It is...<eos> Carmen. Carmen luna.<eos> Carmen, my office.<eos> I saw you.<eos> Saw what? I took a picture.<eos> Big deal. Not that.<eos> I saw you at the powell house.<eos> In a leather jumpsuit
Of course.<eos> Genevieve made a sex tape.<eos> [ chuckling ] oh... My god.<eos> Escándalo!<eos> It was with that tennis pro who got murdered.<eos> And he showed it to some of his friends at the club.<eos> Genevieve is so embarrassed.<eos> I would be, too.<eos> The blooming orchid?<eos> At her age? Hmm.
Father al:<eos> You maybe sinned?<eos> That's a new one. I think i'm in a gray area.<eos> I'm a married woman, and i had a dirty dream.<eos> Ah. And this dream was not about your husband?<eos> It was about one of my husbands.<eos> What?<eos> I dreamed about my husband who died.<eos> I see.<eos> Your late husband.
Adrian, how did this happen?<eos> What were you doing?<eos> I don't recall.<eos> What did Carmen say I was doing?<eos> She said she found you on the sofa in the study.<eos> Oh. Then there you have it. [Door opens]<eos> Mr. Powell, how you feeling?<eos> Better, thanks. When can I go home?<eos> [Door closes] First, I need to ask you about the wounds we found on your body.<eos> What wounds?
Did Blanca do this?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Blanca was our friend, and she didn't kill anybody.<eos> But if that's true and this is all a setup, then who killed Blanca?<eos> [Sighs deeply] Oh, that was quite the sigh.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I just keep thinking about my friend Blanca.<eos> Oh. The murderer.
You think something happened to her here?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Thank you for bringing this to my attention.<eos> Could be helpful.<eos> You'll give it to the police?<eos> Of course.<eos> But going forward, uh, let's be careful what we say about Blanca in front of Katy.<eos> Before we adopted her, she went through some... trying times.<eos> In Argentina.

On the contrary... everybody loves it.<eos> In fact, Genevieve finds it very endearing.<eos> Nnnnnnh... You don't think so?<eos> Look, Genevieve is crazy about you.<eos> I haven't seen her this excited about a man in a long, long time.<eos> I feel the same.<eos> But that's exactly why it's so hard for her to tell you when she doesn't like something.<eos> And she doesn't like... "Ooh, la, la"?<eos> May I ask you, in what context she dislikes it?<eos> All contexts.

She took my dress!<eos> And let's not forget, it's still out there somewhere.<eos> Yes, Blanca's dead, but that's the big mystery.<eos> #Where'sCarmen'sdress?<eos> Maybe Mrs. Taylor was asking Blanca to keep her affair a secret.<eos> But Blanca had a big mouth, so Taylor took her out.<eos> No, Taylor didn't do it.<eos> Whoever killed Louie killed Blanca.<eos> And to chop up a body, the killer would have to be strong.<eos> - Someone in really good shape.
No, that's not my problem.<eos> - If you say so.<eos> - It's Dr. Neff.<eos> He keeps doing my housework behind my back, rearranging the kitchen.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, and it's rude.<eos> I don't go to the hospital and reoperate on his patients.<eos> But why not just accept the help?<eos> You're not exactly at your best right now.<eos> Not at my best?
I've just, uh, I'm just trying to go on more auditions.<eos> I booked a big commercial.<eos> Oh? It sounds like you're doing great.<eos> Yeah, I'm... I'm going to the gym a lot, eating healthy, going to meetings.<eos> I haven't had a drink in forever.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> I was worried you might fall off the wagon.<eos> But you didn't!<eos> How's Ernesto?<eos> Good.
Be right back.<eos> Katy pushed Miguel?<eos> He tried to kiss her.<eos> [Chuckles] Well, that sounds like normal kid stuff.<eos> Then she said she would kill him and dance in his blood.<eos> Oh. Mrs. Taylor, that is a very scary thing for a girl to say.<eos> Where would she have heard that?<eos> I...have no idea.<eos> - She had a hard childhood.<eos> - In México?

How's the P.I. business?<eos> Good. Good, good, good.<eos> Listen, I have a job for you.<eos> I need you to find a young boy's birth parents.<eos> Michael, I'm glad you stopped by.<eos> Well, I know how much you care about Taylor, and I thought maybe you could, you know, help me out.<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Just keep an eye on her, make sure she's all right.<eos> I'm afraid she's... she's in over her head.<eos> - How so?
- Normal child's play.<eos> - No!<eos> He needs a firm hand.<eos> Well, I don't want Deion to grow up without a healthy fear of authority.<eos> Perhaps he could use a little discipline.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad you agree.<eos> You'll take care of that, then?<eos> Take care of what?<eos> Discipline...
My Italian sofa.<eos> These slipcovers have been laundered.<eos> The label states clearly "dry-clean only."<eos> Blanca must have done that. I've never touched those.<eos> Oh, for God's sake.<eos> If the cancer wasn't killing me, this would.<eos> It looks nice to me.<eos> Well, that's why I'm the designer and you're the maid.<eos> So, remember when you said to let you know if Olivia did anything suspicious?<eos> Oh, my God.
But Deion needs you to help him become a good person.<eos> I am trying.<eos> But you can't just do the fun part of parenting.<eos> You got to do it all.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> You sure you have time?<eos> I thought you were on Death's door.<eos> Nope.<eos> Just yours.
I cannot steal lemon's thunder.<eos> They stole our engagement!<eos> Look, we have to tell lemon the truth.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Their engagement party is tonight.<eos> I've already ruined her last engagement party. Also, her last wedding.<eos> Well, then, lavon has to tell lemon the truth.<eos> We can't ask him to do that.<eos> They seem so happy. They're...<eos> Over the moon!

Oh, 'cause your eyes just rolled back in your head a little.<eos> Uh, well... Just 'cause you know...<eos> Sal the shrimp guy?<eos> What a cad!<eos> Well...<eos> Oh. Neither the pritchetts Nor frank have spilled anything<eos> Shelby: Wade and lemon should be here any minute, and...<eos> This party is exquisite.<eos> Lemon is gonna love it.<eos> Oh, dear.
I'll go. We can stop for chili dogs.<eos> It's right on the way.<eos> Hey.<eos> You doing all right there?<eos> I'm tired.<eos> And I know who did it.<eos> You ready?<eos> Bring him out, get his reaction when he sees the body.<eos> Where did they find him?<eos> Stairs of the parish house.
It all went down so fast.<eos> What happened?<eos> I don't remember anything.<eos> Some fucking loser crazy chick got in the club.<eos> Drugged up. Took some shots.<eos> Wanted someone to pay for her not being on the list or some shit like that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> I got to do a run, babe.<eos> Out in Jersey.
Never heard anything back.<eos> He just vanished off the face of the Earth.<eos> All these years, I...<eos> I just keep thinking, you know, one day, he'll just...<eos> Turn up, all grown up and happy...<eos> It's... always hardest around the holidays.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> What do you do for a living, Ms. Delacroix?<eos> Um, I'm a casting director.<eos> TV, mostly.
Puts down a serial killer, helps him win the election.<eos> O'Shea's elected mayor, Irving never makes chief.<eos> Never knew you had such a nose for politics, Jerry.<eos> Fuck you, Harry.<eos> Your full name, birth date, and place of birth?<eos> Raynard Waits.<eos> No middle name.<eos> Born November 3, 1971, - in the City of Angels.<eos> - You mean Los Angeles.<eos> Los Angeles.
This soup is freezing!<eos> I don't think this is working.<eos> What the living hell is this?<eos> It's not enough just to say things out loud.<eos> I need someone I can talk with.<eos> You may as well be that old volleyball I drew a face on.<eos> Wilson, from Cast Away?<eos> More nonsense.<eos> Look, you're a very nice man, but you're not gonna be the person I can talk to about the bunker.<eos> The bunker?
You never played in Los Angeles?<eos> How come?<eos> You had huge success with... Pickup Pitch.<eos> We should've gone.<eos> We were invited and all.<eos> - We just didn't go. - Why not?<eos> - When was that?<eos> - 1988.<eos> - 1988!<eos> Holy cow! - 1988?
Wait for me<eos> Where time is forever<eos> Wait for me<eos> How come a crappy musician like him makes such a lot of money?<eos> We live in a world that gets crappier every day.<eos> Your eyes in my eyes<eos> Just like before<eos> Not so long ago<eos> We used to sing<eos> The same notes, the same chords
- Ma belle.<eos> I'm the eggman.<eos> I am the Walrus.<eos> John Lennon<eos> We're about to take off.<eos> Wim! What are you doing? - Wim!<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> Wim! Hey, where are you going?<eos> I'll take the train.<eos> A train?
Oh, shit.<eos> Don't you feel betrayed by Jipé?<eos> - Betrayed?<eos> - Yes. You know... Him.<eos> Five years.<eos> He could've told us.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't tell everything either.<eos> I don't tell I play in another band.<eos> In Anvers.
You're a bunch of rednecks.<eos> Have you seen the sunset? Of course you haven't.<eos> Too much poetry for you, huh?<eos> - Did you see? It sets in the West.<eos> - Yes.<eos> OK, manneke. Come here for a second.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Rock n' roll, buddy?<eos> - Yes. - Yeah, rock n' roll.<eos> - Alright?
No! No!<eos> This time, you've gone too far.<eos> You've gone too far. OK?<eos> That's right! Leave!<eos> Go fuck yourself!<eos> The chops, the sausages...<eos> Everything...<eos> And Jipé.<eos> - All this is my fault, somehow.<eos> All this mess.
That's a good idea.<eos> Alright, Wim?<eos> Wim!<eos> Jipé.<eos> Rock n' roll, buddy!<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was Big Bear's last concert.<eos> And... I'm sorry about the singer.<eos> In a bag.
Oh, my god! That's what she was gonna tell me!<eos> Karen, I swear to god, i thought she was gonna say that she was pregnant again or something.<eos> I have to go, but we can talk about this all night, okay?<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Remote control over there, wine in the fridge.<eos> Tissues in the bathroom.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Love you.<eos> Hi, Dr. Adams.<eos> Couple of ground rules.
Why don't you guys stay here in L.A.?<eos> And that way, me and Scotty can see each other whenever we want.<eos> I could get into some socal living.<eos> Previouslyon"mistresses"...
Alec doesn't respond.<eos> Have you thought about counseling?<eos> Oh, the last thing that Alec wants to talk about is our sex lives.<eos> I mean, he can barely talk about lunch without breaking into hives.<eos> You and Alec love each other.<eos> It's so clear.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> I've felt it. The ember's still strong.<eos> If Alec is resistant to therapy, then you'll just have to find a creative way to fan the old flames.<eos> Creative, how?
How do you all feel about Marc and Scotty living here with us?<eos> Awesome!<eos> Previously on Mistresses...
Now we're talking about Harry and Joss.<eos> Why is he great?<eos> Uh, he's not.<eos> He's just...<eos> You know, he's fine.<eos> No, you didn't say "fine." You said "great."<eos> Uh...<eos> look, April, uh... men and women tend to... deal with breakups differently.<eos> I'm... sure you know this.<eos> Differently how?
All right.<eos> No more girls-gone-wrong reminders.<eos> This Joss'?<eos> This?<eos> Well, it ain't mine.<eos> All right, I'm gonna put this in the closet here.<eos> If I've missed anything, you toss it in.<eos> If you need the box out of here, I'll pick it up.<eos> How's the restaurant?<eos> Fine.
- No.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> Listen, you just sit back and relax, okay?<eos> I've taken care of the entire thing.<eos> Of course you have.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> No regrets?<eos> - Not a one.
Uh, what was I even saying?<eos> How your life with this Scott would have been perfect.<eos> Holy Christmas.<eos> Like?<eos> Like? !<eos> Oh, my...<eos> I-I love. What...<eos> I outbid some fancy fashion designer from New York last-minute.<eos> Calista something?<eos> Anyway...
She just abandoned me.<eos> I hate her.<eos> I do.<eos> I hate her.<eos> - Where the hell have you been?<eos> - I'm 10 minutes late.<eos> 20 minutes late, and I've been calling you all day.<eos> Sorry, but my phone was off.<eos> Did you tell April about Niko?<eos> Who?
What, seriously?<eos> You'd fire me after one screw-up?<eos> - Man, that's messed up.<eos> - You show up<eos> - to work drunk, which is bad enough.<eos> - Come on.<eos> But the fact that you told April my business?<eos> What business?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Niko!
Should I be worried?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll call you back as soon as I know what they have.<eos> That's Calista's car backing out of her driveway the night of the murder.<eos> What?<eos> That's her ring!<eos> That's...<eos> That's Calista.<eos> Placing her at the scene of the crime at the time of the murder.<eos> Oh, my...
Are you okay?<eos> I'm just tense, Marc.<eos> Very tense.<eos> Hello?<eos> Calista Raines?<eos> Who is this?<eos> How did you get this number?<eos> Yeah, I'm a reporter from the Times.<eos> Do you have any comment on the newly released videotape?<eos> What... What tape?
He's seeing a lot of other chefs.<eos> Well, yeah, but you're still in the running, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So don't give up.<eos> You know what I'd like to do more than anything right now?<eos> See the house with you.<eos> You want to meet me there for the inspections?<eos> Oh, baby, I am on my way.<eos> Bye.<eos> Whoa. Oh, my God.
I think the... the Marc-L.A. experiment has kind of run its course.<eos> Think I might go trek Machu Picchu, get off the grid for a while.<eos> Uh-huh. Did April reject you?<eos> I think it's safe to say I have plummeted in her esteem.<eos> She found out about the drinking.<eos> And the way she used to look at me?<eos> That look that...<eos> Gave me hope that maybe someday she might...<eos> Feel the same?<eos> Well...
Calista and I are co-conspirators.<eos> Oh, shoot.<eos> - Tough break.<eos> Well... hey.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> Not in the yard.<eos> Tears to a mean girl's like blood to a shark.<eos> Listen.<eos> You think you J.Lo, bitch?<eos> Oh, God.
Now a few orders of business.<eos> Um... Your mum's ship finally docked in, uh, Finland.<eos> That's her number, and I haven't been able to reach David, but...<eos> - Do we have to talk about this?<eos> - No, I was just gonna say that I have complete faith in him.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've looked into him, and he's... he's good.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Now... for my plans.
Well, if your lawyer was worth his spit, he should've brought you a deal.<eos> Yeah... 10 to 12 if I confess to the crime and say that Calista planned it.<eos> Oh, so, you're gonna take it?<eos> My lawyer says I definitely shouldn't.<eos> Well, it ain't his life on the line.<eos> What are you saying... that I should confess to a crime that I didn't commit?<eos> I'd rot in here till I was like 40.<eos> Look, I'm just saying, think about it for two seconds before you reject it out of hand.<eos> What happens if you lose at trial?<eos> Worst-case?
You had me sleeping on the couch all night.<eos> My back was killing me.<eos> Can i get this chiropractor's name?<eos> Oh, he's expensive. I doubt you could afford him.<eos> I want to verify your alibi.<eos> Can i get back to you on that?<eos> Adrian, what's going on?<eos> Mr. Powell, this is a murder investigation, And if you can't provide your whereabouts, I'll have to take you down to the station.<eos> I was at the... Club.<eos> The country club, the yacht club?

[ chuckles ] it's like nothing's changed.<eos> [ sighs ] i feel the same way. Okay.<eos> I'll see you.<eos> Well, it's official.<eos> We are now social pariahs. How so?<eos> [ sighs ]<eos> We have been disinvited from three events.<eos> It's that damn leg.<eos> Oh, soon enough, people will start gossiping about something else.<eos> Yes, perhaps your delightful, little romp At the sex club.
- Deus ex machina, as they say.<eos> And how's the lovely Miss Muff Bulldagger?<eos> Fiery and full of lust like a coked-up Amish teenager.<eos> - That sounds exhausting.<eos> - Oh, you have no idea.<eos> I'm thinking of going strictly dickly for a while.<eos> You free later?<eos> Uh, no, actually, I, uh, got this thing.<eos> - Um, a school thing or a sex thing? - Um...<eos> - Uh, both.

For a minute, I thought I'd just get on the plane to Atlantic City and fly away, but I didn't.<eos> I've been to Atlantic City, you made the right choice.<eos> You know, Paige was wrong.<eos> She should have stayed.<eos> I don't think she was wrong.<eos> She got out.<eos> We should all think about getting out of here.<eos> To Atlantic City?<eos> I just said that...<eos> No, no, not to Atlantic City, to anywhere.
This is taking too long. You don't just leave 70 grand out in the open.<eos> Someone should've been here 10 minutes ago.<eos> Torres is laughing at us right now.<eos> Heads up, guys... here we go.<eos> - He's headed towards Lincoln.<eos> - Yeah, I see him.<eos> He just made Junior.<eos> Terry, he's headed right for you.<eos> Aah! Up you go.<eos> You good?
Thank you.<eos> I plan on using that line someday myself.<eos> For your sake, I hope you don't have to.<eos> So, I saw the trial's all wrapped up.<eos> All but the judge's decision.<eos> So, now you just wait?<eos> Is it killing you?<eos> In a manner of speaking.<eos> He's not going for the death penalty, is he?<eos> In this city?
Sweetie, I only need one bouquet.<eos> Half of 70 is still only 35.<eos> One bouquet costs 50 kronor.<eos> Two bouquets together cost 70 kronor.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> It's pure madness.<eos> I'm reporting this to the Consumer Ombudsman.<eos> - Is there a manager here?<eos> - No, she's at lunch.<eos> Lunch?
Ove?<eos> - How nice the bookshelf is.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How many books do you have?<eos> It's these here and the box in the kitchen, and then the ones in the storeroom.<eos> I'll build another.<eos> They say the brain works faster as it dies.<eos> As if the impressions of the outside world become slow-motion.<eos> I had time to think about a good deal.<eos> Mostly about the radiator, actually.

You forgot this.<eos> After that day, I got up every morning and took the 7:30 train.<eos> But she'd completely disappeared.<eos> After three weeks, I was about to give up.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Do you usually take this train?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm in the army.<eos> In... the regiment.
- Yeah.<eos> - Then that's that.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hello.<eos> - You're fifteen minutes late.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> So...<eos> - Do you know anything about cars?<eos> - About cars?
She was the strongest of all.<eos> Ove.<eos> Either we die or we live.<eos> That night, I took the car and built what was needed in one night.<eos> The next day, Sonja was able to start working.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Homer wrote The Iliad about the Trojan war.<eos> But when was The Iliad written?<eos> - David?<eos> - The year 700.
From who?<eos> - Hi, how nice.<eos> Lena, from the local paper.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I have the last three years' statements from the healthcare company Konsensus that you're a shareholder of.<eos> There's a marginal profit reported.<eos> At the same time, I have statements from a bank in the Canary Islands.<eos> It's had millions in deposits.<eos> - Where did you get them?<eos> - On the internet.
He sent three kids home with concussions.<eos> Two with busted eardrums and one with a ruptured testicle. It was gym.<eos> Decided to play kickball.<eos> - What if he shows remorse? - What's that?<eos> - It means you say you're sorry.<eos> - I'm not. - Lie.<eos> - Isn't lying in court illegal?<eos> Tell the judge what she wants to hear.<eos> Carl, she could give you a year.<eos> - Better than school.
Oh, I need a drink.<eos> Morning drinker, woman after my own heart.<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> Cancer.<eos> Cancer?<eos> Stage three, pancreatic. - When did you find that out?<eos> - Ten minutes ago.<eos> Oh, Jesus, you do need a drink.<eos> - Alibi Room, it's a couple of blocks away.<eos> - Okay, which direction?
- Hmm?<eos> To college, med school, interning, residency all work and no play.<eos> Good old-fashioned Puritan work ethic.<eos> Here's to all that time wasted.<eos> Well, exactly.<eos> People scoff, but those are words I live by.<eos> Every day is an opportunity you don't get back, so don't blow it working.<eos> God, where were you with all that carpe diem crap when I was in my 20s?<eos> Um, this seat, mostly.<eos> Couple of crack houses.
Well, what do you do when you're pissed at some jerk that screwed you?<eos> Keep it bottled inside.<eos> - You ever clock someone?<eos> - No. - Hit them with a brick?<eos> - No.<eos> - Run over with a car?<eos> - Jesus, no.<eos> You have not lived until you've heard the bones of your enemy being crushed under 3000 pounds of Detroit steel.<eos> I wanted to once.<eos> Prom.
Yo, if you're gonna smoke an illegal substance you can at least do it in the privacy of your own shitty dorm room.<eos> People hassling me.<eos> Maybe that's because you steal their stuff.<eos> Doing a great job of hiding the evidence.<eos> They leave their doors open with all their shit in there.<eos> You're gonna get kicked out of school.<eos> And leave all the wonderful new friends I've made?<eos> I gotta go, man. Work study.<eos> What's the job?<eos> Library.
- Why the fuck did you do that, Carl?<eos> - When Paul Sundie came out of juvie he knew how to make IDs and launder money.<eos> You can't buy that kind of education.<eos> Plus, my street cred will be off the chain.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna make juvie my bitch.<eos> We'll send letters.<eos> It was bound to happen sooner or later.<eos> - He'll be okay.<eos> - Okay?
Argumentative.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Mr. Cochran, please refrain from badgering the witness.<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> Detective Lange... is it possible that these murders could be drug-related?<eos> Objection.<eos> Sustained.<eos> You're being a little vague, counsel.<eos> Detective, have you ever heard of a Colombian necktie?<eos> A what?
Not really.<eos> You're a halfling.<eos> Half human and...<eos> Half like me.<eos> It happens once in a blue moon.<eos> Well, ever since I was a child, I-I've been drawn to thinnies... and the Void.<eos> Am I just trying to go home?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Very little is known about your kind.<eos> What about visions?
Why did you leave the power plant?<eos> That wasn't the mission.<eos> What did you do to Kira?<eos> We got stuck in the dark.<eos> What?<eos> Kira's dead.<eos> You bastard!<eos> You son of a bitch!<eos> This is your fault!<eos> All of it!
Tell me what you did to Audrey!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> She's gone.<eos> Hello, friends.<eos> This is Darkside Seeker Seth Byrne, bringing you the truth from this... uh, parking lot.<eos> Where strange things happen.<eos> Whoa, what... what are you doing?<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I paid you 20 bucks. What are you talking, strange things?<eos> Not on my watch.
I got these myself.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> - Any progress?<eos> - Some, but not enough.<eos> Did you mean it today, when you raised your hand?<eos> No.<eos> But I knew if I did, the others who wanted to would be less afraid.<eos> Is that it?<eos> The bill?
Your buddy's a little harsh.<eos> Ah, but you get to know him... He's worse.<eos> Sabovich: Roger that.<eos> They're not so bad.<eos> Well, markham's not.<eos> The polack could talk less and bathe more.<eos> Fair point.<eos> You know Lou's letting me do a ride-along?<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Down in watts.
Looking for a blue riviera, '63 or later, two-door.<eos> Charmain give you that?<eos> The blue part and that it sideswiped a red studebaker.<eos> The late model buick two-door, moran got off the cook that was out back.<eos> And leaky oil pan, off the scene.<eos> Sam: The bloody boot print is a common crepe bottom work boot.<eos> The weapon is a colt 1911 .45.<eos> And you buy her description?<eos> That the shooter's white?<eos> In that neighborhood?
Look, you couldn't even get one hole in your target.<eos> The winner is Pavlichenko with 47 out of 50 points.<eos> Commander, are you sure you checked those right?<eos> Look for yourself if you want.<eos> How many points for Feldman?<eos> Oh Lyuda, it's good that we didn't go to the cinema after all, right?<eos> Ha!<eos> Serves you right!<eos> Every war ends either in peace, or in armistice.<eos> So, in the year 1651...
How can you be against war?<eos> War is the only thing that can create justice in the world.<eos> And we, we're the ones who bring it about.<eos> No.<eos> Your opinion is very popular these days, I know.<eos> Yes.<eos> But I've never believed that.<eos> Anyway, you're getting worked up for nothing.<eos> There's not going to be a war.<eos> Really?
Alcohol.<eos> Wait here!<eos> In recognition of the destruction of a tank during battle, General-Major Petrov,<eos> Commander of the 25th Rifle Division, personally awards the SVT-40, semi-automatic rifle to Red Army Woman Pavlichenko.<eos> A separate role is played by the air force in the destruction of enemy forces-<eos> Company, attention!<eos> Soldier Pavlichenko, L.M., step forward!<eos> Sir!<eos> Huh!<eos> Really?
Shoo!<eos> Out of the way!<eos> Out of the way!<eos> No, I'm Lyuda!<eos> You're late.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I invited you to a wedding, but it's ended up as a wake.<eos> They killed Gregory.<eos> So let's honour his memory.<eos> In his memory.
Eyewitnesses said that the bomb was made out of a shoebox and duct tape.<eos> So bombers are monogamous with their materials.<eos> Older materials suggests someone over 35.<eos> And then there were two.<eos> The one on the left is currently under surveillance in San Antonio.<eos> The other's been off the grid for over a year.<eos> That is our target.<eos> No name, no photo.<eos> We know that he detonated a bomb in Italy and another in France.<eos> And now, here in the States.
You must know Free4All.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Dude's ridiculously skilled.<eos> Yeah, Free's FriendAgenda tabnabbing exploit was top-shelf.<eos> Yeah, and adding a "Your session has timed out" page was genius.<eos> I hear he went after FriendAgenda because they banned him for life.<eos> Yeah, well, that's the word on the wire.<eos> All right, Avery.<eos> I'll let you in.<eos> Uh, under one condition, though.
Yeah, and adding a "Your session has timed out" page was genius.<eos> I hear he went after FriendAgenda because they banned him for life.<eos> Yeah, well, that's the word on the wire.<eos> All right, Avery.<eos> I'll let you in.<eos> Uh, under one condition, though.<eos> I get to type the encryption key myself.<eos> You want to type?<eos> Type into a text file.<eos> No Internet.
You've been angry for such a long time.<eos> That anger is there to protect you from fear.<eos> Now, we could argue that the fear comes from an abusive and drunk father, but it doesn't really matter where it comes from.<eos> What matters is that it can be beaten.<eos> I'm gonna rid you of that burden so you can reach your potential.<eos> And then you're gonna be ready.<eos> Ready for what?<eos> - The army again?<eos> - No.<eos> Not the army.
My name is Liv Moore, and I died, sort of.<eos> I had a promising career and a great fiance.<eos> Then I went to the world's worst boat party and got turned into a zombie.<eos> Now I work at the morgue for access to brains, but brain eating has side effects.<eos> I take on the victim's personality traits and have visions which I use to help solve their murders.<eos> I work with a detective who thinks I'm a psychic and my boss, the medical examiner, the only person who knows my secret.<eos> I'm a crime-fighting zombie.<eos> Previously on iZombie...
Ever since the CDC sacked me with no notice, week-to-week is how I roll.<eos> So, to sum it up, satisfied with my current living situation, concerned with your paranoia with regards to both Major and Clive.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> But remember, just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean there's not some strange stuff going on out there.<eos> Ah, grazie, Bella.<eos> Nice fake bake, Donatella Versace.<eos> How do you get yours to come out so even?<eos> By sleeping with someone who's got her own private aesthetician.<eos> Did my two sides of beef come in?<eos> In the back.
The cavalry arrived in time.<eos> You're both okay?<eos> Ah, we're both enjoying the sight of A.J.'s crew spread-eagled on a black and white.<eos> When they rolled up, we found enough heavy artillery in the trunk to put them all away on weapons charges.<eos> We also found three bloody teeth.<eos> I'll bet you chowder at Ivar's at least one of them belongs to Sammy.<eos> I think I owe you more than a bowl of soup.<eos> I really messed up on this one. I should've trusted you.<eos> Three times I told you to stay out of it, Liv.<eos> On two separate occasions.
'Now a special announcement.<eos> The German government announced tonight their response to a British communication and gave their proposals for a settlement of the Polish problem.'<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> - In front of the fire.<eos> Kettle done?<eos> - Not for an hour or so.<eos> - Right.<eos> I've come to a decision, Ma.<eos> What about?<eos> Enlisting.
Take me to Guantánamo?<eos> Frommer doesn't want me to do much of anything anymore.<eos> I need your help.<eos> With what?<eos> I need to find my wife.<eos> I can track her cell.<eos> In 2 miles, turn right on Northvale Road.<eos> All right, I got her.<eos> - Northvale Road in...<eos> - In Delaware.
- This is Stella. Katja's sister.<eos> Hi!<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Come in.<eos> Is everything alright?<eos> You were home, right?<eos> Yes, I went home to get some stuff.<eos> - You went on a trip, right?<eos> - Yes, we went to Rome.<eos> Rome.
And you don't have to ask if you can ask.<eos> You need to see me as your guide, yeah?<eos> Your mentor, your first point of contact, a friend, confidante, your light at the end of the tunnel.<eos> All right?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ~ Good.<eos> So ask away now.<eos> Do we have any biscuits?<eos> In the cupboard, man!
Oh, right.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> ~ I didn't want to worry you.<eos> ~ You didn't know about this?<eos> No.<eos> But you didn't agree with her contacting the ABV?<eos> Look, I was trying to convince her not to get involved, to just leave things alone.<eos> What exactly did she want to talk to them about?<eos> This.
~ I thought you sustained that injury kicking a football about on the beach?<eos> ~ I did.<eos> But that's not what Shelly thought.<eos> She thought it had been done on purpose.<eos> The text she sent you last night also said she was sorry.<eos> An apologetic text.<eos> Like perhaps you were the one she was planning on complaining about?<eos> ~ No!<eos> ~ Then who?<eos> Alison Turner.
That is not your concern.<eos> The Gazette De France will report on the funeral with consideration of a royal passing.<eos> A grave is prepared.<eos> A grave error, to be sure.<eos> How is he?<eos> As you would expect.<eos> He should be here.<eos> The king does not mourn.<eos> In public perhaps.<eos> In truth, anywhere.
We got this, Paul.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna get an E.T.A. on the chopper.<eos> This isn't good.<eos> There's just too much blood.<eos> This angio was inconclusive.<eos> Now, focus, Krista.<eos> No mistakes.<eos> All I can think about is that poor mom losing her little girl.<eos> In any other room in the world, that's called compassion.<eos> Not in the O.R.
Ooh, that was intense.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm just glad she's okay.<eos> You really don't sweat it, do you?<eos> It's all in the breathing.<eos> Look, once upon a time, I was wound up tighter than you or anybody else I know.<eos> I am not that uptight.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, whatever.
He just wants to die.<eos> Yeah, I don't think he's gonna get off that lucky.<eos> He's devastated about what he did.<eos> Especially how it's gonna affect Alex.<eos> He can't even face her.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I have to tell her before the police get here.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Mm. - Yeah.<eos> Good times.
Oh, man.<eos> I have to tell her before the police get here.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Mm. - Yeah.<eos> Good times.<eos> So, they're taking this thing off?<eos> I was just starting to like it.<eos> It's kind of a cool look.<eos> Well, listen, with some time and healing and a good amount of physical therapy, you're gonna be ready to work.<eos> Work?
What's that?<eos> My breast-cancer-gene test.<eos> What did it say?<eos> I haven't opened it yet.<eos> Just been too scared.<eos> I can imagine.<eos> I mean, I can't, but...<eos> What we talked about earlier... you can't control what's in that envelope, but you can control what you do when you find out.<eos> You'll be there for me, right?<eos> Every step of the way?
At first, I thought it was just cramps, but then I got a fever.<eos> Uh, where are your parents?<eos> We need their consent for tests.<eos> My dad's driving in from Dallas.<eos> He had to go there for work.<eos> But you can reach him on his cell.<eos> Does this mean I'm gonna have to miss volleyball?<eos> I gotta get my practice time.<eos> Uh, what are you in?<eos> Eighth grade?

Come on. We won't let it.<eos> Aren't we a mess tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How about this?<eos> How about this?<eos> How about we move away from the awkward silences and, uh, try to guess what the other person is feeling?<eos> Give me a little space here.<eos> How about we talk about something that's really been bothering me?<eos> W-what?
We're at a plateau.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We can... we can talk about these things.<eos> - I'm not!<eos> - Uh, yes, you are.<eos> I mean, you done woke...<eos> - No, I'm not!<eos> - You done woke me up outta some deep, sound sleep.<eos> - You are making this up!<eos> - Dream state, okay?
Well, you're a smart man, Doc, but unless you ever felt responsible for getting someone killed...<eos> Well, I have.<eos> Here?<eos> No.<eos> Afghanistan.<eos> Someone close?<eos> Yeah, very.<eos> You don't like talking about it?<eos> Nope.<eos> In my group.
I've been here with her the whole time.<eos> And... and... and the baby?<eos> The baby looks fine, for now.<eos> But we're monitoring things.<eos> I'll give you some privacy.<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> We'll try to make Ali as comfortable as possible until the donor heart arrives, and then Dr. Clemmens will perform the transplant.<eos> Hey. How's Jordan?<eos> Not good.<eos> Still in a coma.
As soon as we're done with him, he's all yours, I promise you.<eos> Hey, Kenny, trauma panel.<eos> Hang two units of O-neg.<eos> Crossbatch another six-pack.<eos> Two six-packs?<eos> Hell, make it a case.<eos> - Let's get him sedated.<eos> - No! Keep him awake.<eos> We need to be able to ask some questions<eos> - about the second sniper.
Liberia.<eos> How long are you gone for again?<eos> I don't know.<eos> As long as they need me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, but, I mean, I'll have breaks.<eos> You could come visit.<eos> We could meet up in Italy.<eos> You ever been?<eos> To Italy?
Bagram Air Force Base.<eos> These Marines are gonna take the girls to the helipad.<eos> Let's go, now!<eos> Sir, Bagram is a clearing house for torture and rendition.<eos> Ten years ago.<eos> They've cleaned it up since then.<eos> What?<eos> They cannot make us go.<eos> These girls need to be back home with their families, not held prisoner at a US Army base.<eos> Prisoner!

No!<eos> Wait, let's talk!<eos> Trust me, you will talk.<eos> You'll both talk.<eos> Damn!<eos> you can hold your hokk for a Qreshi!<eos> - No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> Are you a born Westie?<eos> Fifth generation.
- by something impossible.<eos> - Run, Barry, run! My father went to prison for her murder.<eos> Then an accident made me the impossible.<eos> To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensics scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me.<eos> And one day, I'll find who killed my mother...<eos> Mom!<eos> And get justice for my father.<eos> I am...<eos> The Flash.<eos> Previously on The Flash...
And we're late.<eos> Can we do it another time?<eos> Yeah, yeah... yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Bye. - See ya.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Hey.<eos> What bars did Shawna and Clay frequent?<eos> Uh, mostly south side dive bars.
Life becomes so much easier when you learn to accept the apology you never got.<eos> You can't expect her to be sorry for being happy.<eos> She said I was still trapped under a dome because of Angie.<eos> Am I?<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> You have always dreamed of being an engineer, a builder, an inventor, so, why do you think you haven't been able to send in your acceptance letter to Cal Tech, a place to accomplish all your goals?<eos> It just... doesn't feel right.<eos> Joe, I can't tell you how to feel.<eos> But... if you really want to know whether you're still living under a dome, maybe it's time you forgive the person who put you there?<eos> No. No way.
What is that?<eos> The transcripts from Rebecca's first police interview.<eos> Okay, but why?<eos> And where did you find them?<eos> These files are in the cellar.<eos> You stole files from Annalise? !<eos> We can't talk to Rebecca directly, fine, but we can go over all the things she's said about that night<eos> - Wes...<eos> Wes, if Annalise sees that...<eos> In... in... in her police interview,
I-I hardly even had to try.<eos> That was not his first time, okay?<eos> Please... please just call me back.<eos> 100 bucks she comes home without her underwear again and brags about screwing some lacrosse player with... The prettiest penis ever.<eos> Like, what penis is ever pretty?<eos> When did this secret affair begin?<eos> About a year ago.<eos> Where did the sex that night happen exactly?<eos> In the rectory?<eos> At the altar?
About a year ago.<eos> Where did the sex that night happen exactly?<eos> In the rectory?<eos> At the altar?<eos> Objection!<eos> Badgering the witness.<eos> This is a key alibi witness.<eos> I'm entitled to latitude.<eos> Answer the question, Ms. Willis.<eos> In his room.
You love her.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> Don't say that if you don't mean it.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I don't love her anymore.<eos> I love you.<eos> I bet you the boyfriend did it.<eos> - You've been evaluated before.<eos> - Juvie.
It's just surprising, especially since she threatened to fire me if I started seeing you.<eos> But you didn't listen to her, now, did you?<eos> You're not seriously thinking about sex right now.<eos> I always think about sex when you're around.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Frank, what's the endgame here?<eos> If Rebecca talks to the police, we all go down.<eos> But that's not gonna happen, right?<eos> Because you're gonna take care of it?<eos> Her?
Okay?<eos> Please... Please, just call me back.<eos> 100 bucks she comes home without her underwear again and brags about screwing some lacrosse player with The prettiest penis ever.<eos> Like, what penis is ever pretty?<eos> Uh... Hi.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Emily Sinclair.<eos> I'm the new prosecutor on the Sam Keating murder trial.<eos> Do you have time for a few questions?<eos> Uh... About... About what?

How do we get past those soldiers?<eos> [DA VINCI) We don't.<eos> We go over them.<eos> Can't this wait?<eos> The Council of One Hundred has convened in secret.<eos> In the middle of the night?<eos> Has something happened?<eos> Otranto has fallen.<eos> There's no word from Leo also.<eos> Or Lorenzo.
Demanded, more likely.<eos> The woman carries herself with the refinement of a tonsured goat.<eos> We do need her support if we're to win over Venice.<eos> If Laura Cereta has asked to see me, I assure you it is not to offer cooperation.<eos> Your Holiness.<eos> Signora.<eos> Girolamo.<eos> We've met before.<eos> Many years ago.<eos> At his anointment.
You dare talk to me in that way?<eos> Know your place, child.<eos> Her place is here!<eos> She's the mother of Giulio de' Medici, head of--<eos> She is a whore!<eos> Nothing more.<eos> And you, sir, are a miserable drunk who cannot even satisfy those paid well enough to pretend.<eos> Signor Cellini... so willing to sell your soul at the expense of Florence.<eos> I would hate your wife to learn how little concern you have for hers.<eos> Or that of your mistresses.
I think your old partner-- that scumbag Beretti... Damn it.<eos> ...is using his arrest as leverage, trying to undercut his deal.<eos> You hear me talking to you?<eos> What you doing?<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't make it stop.<eos> What'd the doctor say?<eos> Doctor said it's serious.<eos> Serious?<eos> How?
I read it when the industry tried to savage my 2009 spring collection, and it changed everything for me.<eos> It's called 48Lawsof Power.<eos> You're such a douche bag. Your mother went through a lot trying to make us dinner.<eos> I can't believe you gave that little girl the keys to your apartment, Hakeem.<eos> Amateur mistake.<eos> I'll make you a deal, Bill.<eos> If you promise not to exploit Titan, I won't steal him from you.<eos> You're a powerful man, Bill. You can use your power to help him get out of prison instead of letting him twist in the wind while you capitalize off of his, um...<eos> Misfortune.<eos> Yeah, his misfortune.
Everything I do makes me look hip because I am hip.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> You're just jealous.<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> If you were really that concerned about the environment, you wouldn't have bought a new car.<eos> You'd drive the old one until the wheels fell off.<eos> - Oh! - It was him!<eos> Damn it!<eos> What are you stopping the car for?<eos> At the last stoplight.
Comes in here all the time.<eos> You got a last name?<eos> No, sorry.<eos> You got a credit card receipt?<eos> Nope, I prefer not to support the loan-sharking industry.<eos> Debit cards?<eos> They still charge a fee.<eos> And they track everything you buy so they can sell that info to some other big corp.<eos> Are you sure you got a problem with the corporations<eos> - and not the IRS?
Go, go, go, go!<eos> Damn.<eos> You guys all right?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Whew, that was, uh, smaller than I thought it'd be.<eos> I never thought I'd ever see you run that fast.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I was a running back<eos> - in high school.
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible.<eos> - Run, Barry, run!<eos> - My father went to prison for her murder.<eos> Then an accident made me the impossible.<eos> To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me.<eos> And one day, I'll find who killed my mother...<eos> - Mom!<eos> - And get justice for my father.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on The Flash...
You take up position in the grounds nearby, in case the chancellor needs the coup de grace.<eos> If that should happen, I'm unlikely to survive.<eos> Then I had better not miss.<eos> You won't miss.<eos> You NEVER miss.<eos> DOOR CLOSES<eos> How's the captain?<eos> He's in good hands.<eos> The chancellor?<eos> On his way.
Ain't that many of us.<eos> I'll save you some.<eos> I'm sorry, honey.<eos> Are you -- are you okay?<eos> Matt, get her inside.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> What you got, Ben?<eos> In the rubble there.
Steady.<eos> Sir Clifford will see you now.<eos> Acquaint me with your gamekeeping experience.<eos> I worked the Shipley Hall Estate for two years before moving to Tevershall Pit.<eos> And for what reason did you move?<eos> I got wed, needed the better money.<eos> I were always well thought of at Shipley, if that's what you're alluding to.<eos> You were supplied with a written reference?<eos> You served?<eos> What regiment?

He's mine too.<eos> I'll allow, there's worse jobs on this estate!<eos> Hey, you've got me in trouble again, yeah, but he's come up smiling.<eos> Speak up, lad, her ladyship can't hear thee.<eos> "Open the gates, milady, as John Thomas may come in."<eos> It was no-one, come back to bed.<eos> Won't folks be thinking summat, you coming here day and night?<eos> No-one knows.<eos> The lady of the manor can't come and go and people not notice.<eos> Really?
Got it!<eos> Okay, come on, let's go.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> No matter how hard you both try to separate from each other, you seem to be drawn back together, whether you like it or not.<eos> You know what codependency is?<eos> Code... codependency?<eos> Yeah, it's, uh...<eos> You lose yourself in the relationship.<eos> Your separate selves, yes.<eos> Often times to a unhealthy degree.
- Hello?<eos> Dr. Glenroy?<eos> It's, uh, it's Catherine.<eos> Cat.<eos> Hi.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Yeah, good, great, um, about codependency...<eos> You said that people can... can define their existence by their partner in unhealthy ways, right?<eos> Uh, if not caught and corrected, yeah.<eos> Ever in destructive ways?
You said that people can... can define their existence by their partner in unhealthy ways, right?<eos> Uh, if not caught and corrected, yeah.<eos> Ever in destructive ways?<eos> - Mrs. Zalman?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She said she'd given up her whole life for him.<eos> What if she didn't like the fact that he was giving everything they had to his foundation?<eos> Well, in extreme situations, when the spouse is unable to separate him or herself from the codependency any other way, they have been known to...<eos> Kill their spouses?<eos> In extreme situations, yeah.
The backup generators should've kicked in by now.<eos> She must've gotten to those, too.<eos> This is bad.<eos> If they're in the middle of Zalman's surgery...<eos> Can you help?<eos> I mean, you've got beast vision or something, right?<eos> Yeah, but I'm no surgeon, Catherine.<eos> You're his only hope.<eos> Where are the generators?<eos> East wing, basement.
I didn't mean to presume.<eos> Uh,goodnight.<eos> Major.<eos> Abigail's gift.<eos> Yes, how foolish of me.<eos> Good night.<eos> - ( violin playing ) - ( quiet chatter ) Clinton:<eos> Ah, a whiff ofcivilization.<eos> - Why, it almost reminds me of Paris.<eos> - London.
Then no.<eos> Matt -- No.<eos> This is nuts.<eos> Why should you risk your life for these people?<eos> And what about our baby?<eos> He needs you.<eos> A-- are you even thinking about him?<eos> Of course I'm thinking about him.<eos> But I'm also thinking about somebody else's child, too.<eos> That poor kid.
It's not your standard kitchen fare.<eos> Fun fact, gentlemen:<eos> Mr. Winkler's wounds here are the exact same as the wounds on the victim from this morning.<eos> The drug dealer?<eos> Littlefield?<eos> Him.<eos> Same weapon.<eos> Same killer, one would suppose.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Right in our house.
You've known them since way back.<eos> Give me some leverage.<eos> Give me an angle.<eos> You really want to work with a murderer?<eos> Somebody gets whacked in the GCPD.<eos> Somebody's gonna get fired for this.<eos> (scoffs) Not me, pal.<eos> Grover.<eos> We got a reliable guy says it was you pulled the page from the guard duty logbook.<eos> No way.
She tried to bring down Falcone.<eos> She failed.<eos> Last time I saw her, Victor Zsasz had her cornered.<eos> We can assume she's either dead or extremely unwell.<eos> Mmm.<eos> You know, this creates some intriguing opportunities.<eos> Falcone will struggle to hold on to her territories.<eos> If we move quickly...<eos> My thinking exactly.<eos> In fact,
Your little friend Penguin told you I was dead.<eos> As good as.<eos> Mm.<eos> - Huh. - I'm not going to lie,<eos> I thought I was gonna end up on top.<eos> Instead, I got played.<eos> Turns out, Penguin has been Falcone's man the whole time.<eos> They played us both for suckers.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Ah, indeed.
Armed robbery perps dating back ten years.<eos> I took out the dead ones and the ones in prison.<eos> A "who's who" of scumbags.<eos> They were casing the place a week before they took it down.<eos> Set off the alarm, then timed the response.<eos> He looks pretty young.<eos> He might not be in here.<eos> You see that?<eos> No, 'cause you took my glasses.<eos> Right there, underneath his coat.
Back before Loeb was commissioner, when he was a lowly homicide dick, you were his partner.<eos> Yeah? That was 20 years ago.<eos> But I always hear that cop partnerships are like marriages.<eos> You know each other better than your wives.<eos> Isn't that right, Jim?<eos> That's right.<eos> You digging up that old story about Loeb killing his wife?<eos> He was with me when she died.<eos> We know about the secret files.<eos> What secret files?
Griggs set us up.<eos> Now Loeb knows we're after his evidence cache.<eos> Griggs sent you?<eos> Guy would turn on anyone to save his own skin.<eos> You just got to scare him enough.<eos> - We tried.<eos> - Let me.<eos> Counselor, trust me, you're gonna want to sit this one out.<eos> I want a name!<eos> - Falcone!
Good.<eos> But... I like salsa.<eos> Tuesday it is.<eos> So... you've completed your task, and the lines of supply are open once again.<eos> I am duly impressed.<eos> Hope is a carrot easily dangled in front of the desperate, Doctor.<eos> And you have earned your carrot.<eos> Welcome to upper management.<eos> I think you'll find the view better than in the basement.<eos> In fact...
Could have had something special. Please.<eos> Please, don't hurt me.<eos> You know, I really thought you were the one.<eos> Please. No.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Sooner or later, I'll find her.<eos> I still don't get it.<eos> Why all that trouble for this pile of bricks?<eos> This was never about money, Gabe.<eos> Not about money?
Told me not to believe my own press as the rising star of the GCPD.<eos> What is it?<eos> The paper that said that... They ran an old photo of me, from a charity gala.<eos> I wasn't alone.<eos> Barbara!<eos> Is Barbara here?<eos> No, why?<eos> Where is she?<eos> When's the last time you saw her?<eos> At the Wayne Ball.
And Earth was one of them.<eos> Blue angels who fell from the sky.<eos> Eons ago, the Kree waged a very long war.<eos> The casualties were high, and they needed more soldiers.<eos> - You mean cannon fodder.<eos> - We needed killers.<eos> One vicious faction among the Kree genetically modified other creatures' DNA.<eos> These modifications can be activated with Terrigen crystals.<eos> We know these torturous experiments failed.<eos> Not on Earth.
Goodbye, Melinda.<eos> Our ride's here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You were right.<eos> For a while there, it all went to hell.<eos> It was bad.<eos> But now Bobbi and I work for an organization, an outlier that came out of the wreckage from what Fury left.<eos> What organization, Mack?<eos> Who the hell are you working for?<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D.
I work for S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> So you want to do this the other way?<eos> Okay, then.<eos> I've lost too many friends to Hydra.<eos> So have I.<eos> You're not in this alone.<eos> I know that much.<eos> Are you working with Hunter?<eos> Or is he just a pawn in this, too?<eos> Oh, God.
Without you, there is no S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> They know about Skye, Phil. Find her.<eos> Agent May.<eos> Weaver ever tell you what happened to her at the academy that day?<eos> Hydra released an enhanced on them, found Weaver fighting to protect the ones that were left behind.<eos> She was actually going toe-to-toe with that monster.<eos> That's not Skye.<eos> All agents, converge on that sound!<eos> No! Skye!<eos> Oh, my God.
Herself.<eos> Mm, you're up early.<eos> Hmm, hey, we got a family to make, And there's only one way to do that.<eos> And I'm dedicated to the cause.<eos> Hmm, so thoughtful.<eos> When you get back, maybe you and I can take a trip. Hmm.<eos> Somewhere warm. Mm.<eos> Focus our efforts to expand.<eos> He's gonna be a hell-raiser.<eos> Uh, not in my house.
- Why don't you stay for now?<eos> We can let everything calm down, and then we can figure it out.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> You know, I-I was pacing a little.<eos> - I don't want to lie.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> It really will be the three of us together, just like we wanted.<eos> There are always threats.<eos> - What can you tell me about her?<eos> - Raina?
- I went home.<eos> - You don't have an alibi, Gavin.<eos> You were there.<eos> We know you were there.<eos> Boss.<eos> Come on, now, son.<eos> I saw her.<eos> I talked to her.<eos> What did you and Dawn talk about?<eos> Not sex.
No, you go.<eos> Where do you work?<eos> Hampshire's Bakery, in Leicester.<eos> What exactly did Ian say?<eos> That he'd given blood for someone else.<eos> It's on the corner.<eos> Mr Whenby? Yeah?<eos> DI Madden, Enderby police station.<eos> Can we have a few words? What's this about?<eos> Down the station.
It's okay, baby.<eos> I know what to do.<eos> Hey, Mack, everything checking out?<eos> What can I say?<eos> I do good work.<eos> I'm headed down to machine room 2 to run a systems test.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Keep me posted.<eos> - Where are the others?<eos> - Already in their places.
Please.<eos> Stop.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> You don't have to live with that pain.<eos> I will.<eos> Oh...<eos> Cal... what are you doing?<eos> Keeping my promise.<eos> You ready to talk about it?<eos> - About what?
- What is wrong with you?<eos> On... who'd you bet on?<eos> You.<eos> Well, excellent choice, but wildly inappropriate, Zach.<eos> Wait. Don't forget these.<eos> Also, in all seriousness... if you find out it's yours, what are you gonna do?<eos> Are you gonna marry her, or do you think you'll just seek employment elsewhere?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Are those my only two options?<eos> - In the paternity pool, yeah.
These are state secrets we're talking about.<eos> -This is treason.<eos> -I don't care.<eos> Well, then at least, be smart about it.<eos> Give the papers to a reporter, anonymously.<eos> Let the newspapers fight the government.<eos> We'll get you the best lawyer and cut you a deal...<eos> Your son is fighting for what is right.<eos> You want to get him a lawyer? Well, what do you know about fighting for anything?<eos> -Walt: Dad.
(Chuckles) I do.<eos> But some of the other guys, they're getting bored with what you're offering.<eos> Get some new trim, maybe they'd be willing to help.<eos> Hey.<eos> Well, sure, I'm busy, but I can bowl a few frames.<eos> Heroin, from guapo, that somehow I need to return without him asking questions I can't answer.<eos> Is that formaldehyde? -Is it?<eos> -Smells like a morgue.<eos> Speaking of, I need your help.<eos> With what?

Is that someone's name?<eos> Judas is in the Bible.<eos> He betrayed Christ and got him nailed to the cross.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I was super confused, too.<eos> Why? !<eos> It's so easy...<eos> So what class was the victim in?<eos> I think ninth grade, class two.<eos> Mine?
Well, I'll keep an eye out...<eos> Here she is. She's right... She's right here.<eos> Chief wants a word.<eos> Chief Dooley?<eos> Just stepped away.<eos> Uh, vita-radiation?<eos> Yes, I think we have something for that in the project rebirth file.<eos> I'll see if I can find it.<eos> What was that about?<eos> Oh, just another errand.
At least the Blitzkrieg Button isn't like nitramene.<eos> I mean, well, if I was to accidentally activate it, no one would get hurt.<eos> Just bring the device back as fast as you can, Miss Carter, and then we can all stop worrying.<eos> Your man, General Wilhelm Keitel, you... you know he was hanged yesterday?<eos> 25 minutes.<eos> That's how long it took for him to die.<eos> Swinging on the rope, gagging...<eos> Horrible way to go.<eos> See, they don't realize that you have to measure the condemned's weight as well as the height.<eos> Otherwise...
And what's that, Agent Thompson?<eos> The natural order of the universe.<eos> You're a woman.<eos> No man will ever consider you an equal.<eos> It's sad, but it doesn't make it any less true.<eos> I can always come to you for the truth.<eos> Good night.<eos> You get it?<eos> What's in the vial?<eos> What vial?
It is too late for me to save my family.<eos> It is not too late for you to save yours.<eos> Yeah, and how am I supposed to work that miracle?<eos> You cannot in your current frame of mind.<eos> You must focus on the good times...<eos> When you and your wife were in love and happy.<eos> That's supposed to help?<eos> Yes.<eos> Just focus...<eos> On her smile...

We're with the strategic scientific reserve.<eos> Well, I'm with the Queens County 4H.<eos> Now take it down the hall.<eos> I suggest you take them seriously, Miss Martinelli.<eos> Miss carte is not.<eos> She has defaced the very walls of this institution.<eos> Mother Hen here says you're friends with Peggy Carter.<eos> Yeah, we're friendly.<eos> She ever tell you about her work?<eos> At the phone company?
My gut says Peggy's close.<eos> All right, then let's find her.<eos> Come here.<eos> I want the entire building canvassed.<eos> If Carter's here, by God, we're gonna find her.<eos> Angie, you're amazing.<eos> I knew you didn't work at the phone company.<eos> Now, the weapons that belonged to Howard Stark...<eos> Where might I find them?<eos> Here, in the lab.
What do you think, chief?<eos> Do you trust her?<eos> No.<eos> But I trust Sousa's gut.<eos> Take a couple of men across the street and do a look-see.<eos> What about Ivchenko?<eos> I'll stay here and babysit the doctor.<eos> Do you mind closing that?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Sure.
What war?<eos> We'll get to that part... when you're ready.<eos> I don't even know your name. What do I call you?<eos> Stick.<eos> Are you gonna lie there all night or get up off your ass?<eos> Jesus, kid.<eos> I'm gone five minutes, you turn this place into a shit show.<eos> You've been gone 20 years.<eos> What are you doing back in my city?<eos> Your city?
Thank you, Wesley.<eos> She approves of your choice of tea.<eos> I picked it up on my last visit to your country.<eos> I thought you might enjoy it.<eos> She says she didn't come for tea.<eos> He does not need you to form my words.<eos> Do you, Wilson?<eos> You speak English.<eos> I speak many languages.<eos> How many?
- Don't worry about it.<eos> - How much?<eos> - I got it covered.<eos> That's all you need to know.<eos> You know, I told you, you shouldn't have borrowed money from him.<eos> But no, you had to be the big shot, huh?<eos> You had to have your face plastered all...<eos> It's not enough I get that shit out there?<eos> I gotta get it in my own house?<eos> In my own house?
Can't print any of it without corroboration, can you?<eos> He could just be throwing smoke.<eos> I mean, he just killed Detective Blake.<eos> Said Blake's partner Hoffman did it, probably on Fisk's orders.<eos> But yeah, it occurred to me.<eos> You could talk to Hoffman.<eos> Tried.<eos> He's in the wind.<eos> Or bottom of the river.<eos> Either way...
Plus, half the force is probably in his pocket.<eos> Well, then, let's pray the Mask gets his hands on him.<eos> Knocks his goddamn head off.<eos> You religious, Karen?<eos> My parents were.<eos> That's probably why I'm not.<eos> You?<eos> Catholic.<eos> Does it help?<eos> With things like this?
- when we first met her at the precinct.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You listened to her heartbeat without her permission?<eos> We're lawyers!<eos> You can't do that!<eos> There's a system in place, and it's weird and invasive and...<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you telling me that since I've known you, any time I wasn't telling the truth, you knew?<eos> And what, you just played along?<eos> Basically.
- Did you speak to her, Fisk's mother?<eos> - Yeah... she's not all there, but...<eos> Matt, what she said about Fisk... he killed his father... when he was 12.<eos> Bashed his head in with a hammer, and then she helped him cover it up.<eos> Well, he was a minor.<eos> It's not gonna be enough.<eos> To put him in jail, no.<eos> But it doesn't line up with everything that Fisk has been saying.<eos> Everything that he has altered on the Internet and at the...<eos> the county clerk's.
What the hell do I know?<eos> I was almost poisoned.<eos> I'm not thinking straight.<eos> Speak with Gao... if she wasn't involved, we might need her support against further unpleasantries.<eos> And if she was involved?<eos> Then it's been an honor doing business with you.<eos> This might hurt.<eos> You okay?<eos> - You talking about the stitches?<eos> - Mostly.
You don't.<eos> So how'd you find out about Owlsley?<eos> You never said.<eos> Your... pal in the mask.<eos> You saw him?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> When?<eos> Where?<eos> You know the alley down by...<eos> - At the alley by the, um...
But how?<eos> Well, the medication put him into respiratory failure.<eos> No, that's not what I mean.<eos> You're saying that he died here in the ER?<eos> Yes.<eos> But how does that even happen?<eos> How do you miss that?<eos> I was with other patients. By the time...<eos> But you were, what, ten feet away from him when he died?<eos> 20?
You all right?<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's stable.<eos> - He's stable.<eos> - He's stable.<eos> Mm, okay, good.<eos> It's okay, Mom.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, boy.
Time for a new assignment.<eos> How's it hanging, Sameen?<eos> Oh, I've had better days.<eos> So has my broker friend here.<eos> You embezzle Twinkies or money, Harvey?<eos> What's up?<eos> We're headed to the stock exchange to try to save the world economy.<eos> Oh, that sounds fun.<eos> Is this an invite?<eos> Not a chance.
- She really was.<eos> No.<eos> My mom is not the only person in my family who has great ideas.<eos> I think she is.<eos> - No.<eos> - They agree.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, get ready...<eos> because I have an idea.<eos> Oh, boy!
Taste.<eos> - Mmm! I added extra salt.<eos> - And it's perfect.<eos> Here, get the better.<eos> Oh, God. Don't stick a knife in it.<eos> It's like a living creature.<eos> Maybe just a little bit of the tail.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What was I saying?<eos> - Boundaries.
Hey, buddy.<eos> I spoke to the girls and cleared up the whole trip thing.<eos> We're not going to Alaska in January.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> - We're going to Hawaii in March.<eos> - Sol...<eos> - I know.<eos> I think I'm not good in these situations.<eos> Let's find another time this week and get it over with.<eos> This week?
A dating site?<eos> Me?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - Oh.<eos> He's handsome.<eos> - And a doctor.<eos> A doctor of what?<eos> Desperation?<eos> Can that happen in your meditation room, please?<eos> With the doors open?
Also the chance of choking on a donut, but we'll worry about that later.<eos> When's the last time you had something to eat?<eos> Oh, God...<eos> She had some chicken at five, and a glass of wine.<eos> Two.<eos> Two glasses of wine.<eos> All right.<eos> You sit tight.<eos> I have to have surgery.<eos> On my hip.
I would be apologizing to Larry's spirit for the rest of my days.<eos> Like it or not, you're my friend.<eos> - I like it.<eos> - Then make me feel it.<eos> I don't want to face this crappy part of my life alone.<eos> Oh, your cookies and cream have melted.<eos> You don't like melty frozen yogurt.<eos> I felt that.<eos> But you still owe me $5.16 for the yogurt.<eos> In that case...
All right, I'll talk to my staff.<eos> We'll draft some language and I'll run it past you.<eos> Jackie?<eos> I want to talk to you about what happened a couple weeks ago.<eos> - I crossed a line.<eos> - Remy, you don't have to.<eos> I want to.<eos> I want to explain myself.<eos> I still have strong feelings, I'm not gonna deny that.<eos> Maybe a different job...
That's how you plan to convince me?<eos> What do you require to pull out of the valley?<eos> That your troops leave as well, and the entire peacekeeping operation.<eos> Well, as soon as your troops withdraw, I'll make sure the UN forces do exactly the same.<eos> Hm. And you scale back missile defense.<eos> As we agreed to twice already.<eos> That's when we were making an entirely different deal.<eos> The main difference now is that we're both standing in the desert, and you can't leave with nothing to show but sand in your shoes.<eos> I'll agree to the scale-back.<eos> Same terms as before.
Just a little light-headed.<eos> - Here.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I was thinking.<eos> About what?<eos> Mrs. Underwood?<eos> Jumping.<eos> - Jumping? - Mm.<eos> You ever have that feeling?<eos> - Conversation?
Legacy is their only child."<eos> Come in.<eos> He sent you a copy, too?<eos> I thought this was supposed to be about you, not us.<eos> The whole thing was a mistake.<eos> We revealed too much, Francis.<eos> I should've never put you in that position.<eos> I'll put an end to it.<eos> - Do you think he was right?<eos> - About what?
And they stay out here.<eos> Hello, Heather.<eos> How's Robert?<eos> He's sad.<eos> But at least he's making his exit with grace.<eos> Those were some very nice things you said about him during your press conference.<eos> Well, what was it you said to me... about, uh, making things palatable?<eos> - The obscene.<eos> - Ah, yes.<eos> The obscene.
- So what?<eos> - He crushes people.<eos> Let this go.<eos> Just start something new.<eos> "Start something new."<eos> Jesus... Christ, you don't get it.<eos> I do it all the time.<eos> My editor passes on a story, I move on to the next one.<eos> I'm so fucking disappointed in you right now.<eos> Me?
Det cord, a lot of it.<eos> Kensi?<eos> Call off NCIS,<eos> FBI, LAPD, all the units in the city.<eos> Call off all rescue attempts.<eos> This building's been wired to explode.<eos> Hetty cut her lunch meeting short.<eos> She'll be here soon enough.<eos> Where was lunch?<eos> Nicaragua.
- Everyone's doing okay?<eos> So, I shut off the jamming systems.<eos> Communications are back online, and, uh, LAPD is pulling up now.<eos> Nice work.<eos> Sam?<eos> Kens, I need a CDC unit for Callen on the 19th floor now.<eos> Nobody leaves this tower.<eos> I want the ground floor locked off.<eos> LAPD is on it. Where are you?<eos> The roof.
I'm not sure yet.<eos> It's a ghost image I extracted from the neurolink that Khlyen put on you.<eos> You recognize it?<eos> I dunno, it's hard to tell.<eos> Well, it's definitely indoors.<eos> - Why's that?<eos> - Isn't that a window?<eos> Where?<eos> - There.<eos> In the corner.
Absolutely.<eos> _<eos> Do we know Sim Reaper's dead?<eos> We cracked open a 1000-dollar bottle of wine that my father bequeathed to me.<eos> We were supposed to hand it down to our children.<eos> But we like to live in the moment.<eos> And this felt like one.<eos> So you were happy about it?<eos> - Delighted.<eos> - Euphoric.
Look, please, just let me ask Lachlan for help.<eos> No.<eos> I do not trust him.<eos> And so, I will leave you with these last words.<eos> "Parting is such sweet sorrow that I shall say good night till it be morrow."<eos> from Romeo and Juliet?<eos> The play we just saw?<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh.<eos> Anyway...
_<eos> Ma, don't pressure her.<eos> _<eos> - I know.<eos> - But, Hon, you want to be a writer.<eos> You said you got butterflies.<eos> _<eos> Ma, if she doesn't chase down her dream, she'll always regret it.<eos> I totally agree.<eos> Anyway,
All those years of you pretending you couldn't walk just to manipulate me?<eos> It was to protect you.<eos> I was afraid you would go back to Milos.<eos> And that man, he is a monster!<eos> Petra... please?<eos> Let me prove myself to you.<eos> Rogelio: How?<eos> How can I forgive you, Xiomara?<eos> I stayed in Miami for you.<eos> In this ridiculous job!
- and hair.<eos> - Just consider it?<eos> How would you even bring me back?<eos> According to BuzzFeed, El Presidente's stabbing was one of the 17 most unforgettable death scenes of the past five years.<eos> We have a pitch.<eos> Not that old "evil twin" cliché.<eos> Dina: No.<eos> It involves a Kevlar vest, a burial at sea, amnesia and a super sexy scene where El Presidente emerges from the water in a soaking-wet shirt.<eos> - Button-down or pullover?<eos> - Button-down.
She's a murderer that killed her father.<eos> I went back to my Ashram in Peru to get over her, and I did.<eos> As a matter of fact...<eos> Hey, Juice!<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> This... is my new girlfriend, the one and only...<eos> Juicy Jordan.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Oh, you probably just don't recognize her outside of the ring.<eos> Out of the ring?
Oh, that's my pants.<eos> It's supposed to encourage the baby to turn towards the music.<eos> I just can't be in the middle, okay?<eos> - Carrying messages between you and Dad.<eos> - I...<eos> I know.<eos> I just need to get in the same room with him so we can talk, face to face.<eos> Let's start with an easy question.<eos> Where were you after the Palomas?<eos> - In my room.
So, tell me.<eos> I mean, before all this... stuff happened... _ we used to talk.<eos> That's all I want.<eos> Don't coddle me, don't handle me.<eos> Just talk to me, please, and not about business.<eos> Latin Lover Narrator: And so, Rafael told his sister everything.<eos> How he asked Jane to marry him.<eos> Dad died, but I had Jane.<eos> I'd never felt so sure about anything.<eos> Or anyone.
The best way to stay anonymous and get instant access to Evan's devices is to wait for him to connect to an open Wi-Fi signal somewhere.<eos> Anywhere they're advertising free Wi-Fi is like a hacker's virtual playground-- tons of unexpected people unaware that the person next to them sharing the same connection could be intruding onto their devices and stealing all their information.<eos> Or in Evan's case, adding information.<eos> Look, I still think he could've done it himself.<eos> I mean, that's just me.<eos> Wi-Fi is the best option.<eos> So... where was Evan hacked?<eos> Well, according to his frequent locations on Evan's phone, he went to the gym three or four times a week.<eos> Most gyms have free Wi-Fi.<eos> Restaurants, too.
She's moving.<eos> Where?<eos> - Here.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> She hears us talking.<eos> Go on with the massage.<eos> Where will we live?<eos> I can chase them off.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The snakes.
There's too many damn people.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you, Dr. Railly.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Dr. Cassandra Railly, born October 3, 1980, Syracuse, New York.<eos> Oldest child.<eos> Intensive care, meningitis, 1986.<eos> Your mother died of an embolism in 1990.<eos> You went to medical school, Columbia.<eos> Viral containment for the CDC, 2015.<eos> 2015?
If big boy here doesn't screw up, and he actually changes history?<eos> Best hangover cure ever.<eos> I've been saving this.<eos> But as they say, no time like the present.<eos> - All right. - To the present.<eos> - Now we're talking.<eos> - Yeah. - All right.<eos> - Toast.<eos> Max ever tell you about Donovan?<eos> Who? Who?
- Enough!<eos> Sir, we just got word that two Russian mi-26 choppers just left a carrier off the coast of the caspian sea.<eos> Get me someone from the Russian mod in Stavropol.<eos> Get our predators in the air.<eos> Fully loaded.<eos> I want eyes up there.<eos> Cole?<eos> Wexler's men are dead.<eos> Where are you?<eos> With the CIA.
My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive.<eos> When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible.<eos> My father went to prison for her murder.<eos> Then an accident made me the impossible.<eos> To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me.<eos> And one day, I'll find who killed my mother and get justice for my father.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on The Flash...

So, you want to talk about what's been going on with you?<eos> What do you think's been going on with me, Barry?<eos> You just seem a bit cavalier, considering what we're up against.<eos> We aren't up against anything.<eos> - Joe, come on, I...<eos> - Look, I'm fine.<eos> Can we just change the subject, please?<eos> Sure.<eos> Actually, you know, I could use some advice.<eos> About what?

You were saying, Mr. Allen?<eos> Uh...<eos> Nothing.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Goodnight Dr. Wells.<eos> - Goodnight Barry.<eos> Barr, what's up?<eos> Why did you want to meet up here so late?<eos> I think that maybe you were right, about Dr. Wells.<eos> Which part?

Cisco, where is she?<eos> City hall.<eos> The Mayor's having a fund-raiser there tonight.<eos> Barry, do not underestimate the Trickster.<eos> Well, hello.<eos> You know, I've been in prison for 20 years.<eos> Then you'll know the routine when you get sent back.<eos> Where's Henry Allen?<eos> He's where you'll be soon.<eos> Heaven!

Supposedly the best in the west.<eos> Why did I not think of this before?<eos> Come to papa.<eos> Caitlin?<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> Okay, six months of investigating Harrison Wells has led us nowhere, so we're going back to the beginning to see what we can find out.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Road trip, baby.<eos> Joe and Cisco are going to go to Starling City.<eos> Starling City? What for?

Oh, I'm not like The Flash at all.<eos> Some would say I'm the reverse.<eos> Hey. You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm fine.<eos> It's just...<eos> I've got this crazy headache.<eos> Thank you for the file and the talk.<eos> - So how did you two meet?<eos> - Work.

No.<eos> You do not have my blessing.<eos> That's Barry.<eos> We got to go.<eos> Joe, I only asked as a courtesy, out of respect.<eos> I don't need your permission.<eos> Really?<eos> For three very smart people, that was really stupid.<eos> What if Wells had caught you in that...<eos> - Time vault.
Why do you have my name?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, 'cause we're family, Eddie.<eos> Funny, I haven't seen you at any reunions or weddings.<eos> That is funny.<eos> And the reason for that is because as far as those guest lists are concerned, I haven't been born yet.<eos> So that's why you didn't kill me that night at S.T.A.R. Labs?<eos> This whole thing...<eos> It's been about me?<eos> Not a chance.

Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash and he kills me.<eos> If this is Dr. Wells, then who have we been working for this whole time?<eos> A completely different person.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I don't wanna kill you, Barry.<eos> I need you.<eos> We will face each other again. Very soon.<eos> I want you to take a moment and think about all the things that define your life.<eos> All the people you love.<eos> Your job... your coworkers... your home.
Guys.<eos> Barry!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do we do now?<eos> Prisoner release protocol initiated.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> No!<eos> Peekaboo.<eos> Do you have any idea what it's like to be stuck in that box?<eos> Now you're the one who's gonna go into a box.<eos> In the ground.
Then lucky for you, I figured out what it is you can get me.<eos> Hello, detective.<eos> Nice to see you again.<eos> Caitlin, Cisco.<eos> I thought about your proposal.<eos> You want my help this is what I want.<eos> My fingerprints, dental records DNA, criminal records, family tree.<eos> Everything there is in this world concerning Leonard Snart I want it destroyed.<eos> All of it.<eos> At C.C.P.D., online, everywhere.
Did you ever file that paperwork?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Meg called.<eos> Danny showed up at her house.<eos> - Is he still there?<eos> - No, he left.<eos> I just found Dad's pickup, and he ain't in it.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Mile marker 86.
Any word on Danny?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - We still got uniforms looking for him.<eos> It should just be a matter of time before someone spots him.<eos> When they do, I wanna bring him in.<eos> The guy took his niece out for a boat ride.<eos> - And nothing happened to her, so...<eos> - He threatened her.<eos> Physically?<eos> Verbally?
Why didn't you stop me that day?<eos> ~ Oh, it's my fault now?<eos> ~ Why did you let me see him?<eos> I felt sorry for you.<eos> I didn't expect you to go all Bruce Lee on him.<eos> Everyone will find out now.<eos> Shit.<eos> Tom will hear about it.<eos> His mum beating up his dad in a police station.<eos> Oh, God.
There was nothing to make me think, I...<eos> I replay that moment every day.<eos> Shutting the door on him, all the things I didn't ask.<eos> How it would have been different if I'd been a better parent.<eos> Thank you, Mrs Latimer.<eos> Stay where you are, please.<eos> As a mum myself, I know it must be difficult.<eos> I'll keep it short.<eos> How was your marriage at the time of Danny's death?<eos> Fine.
No. I found him in the shed with the phone.<eos> And he confessed, as I have recorded in my notes.<eos> I suggest that Joe Miller found Daniel Latimer's phone and was about to report it to the police when you arrived alone and jumped to a false conclusion because it suited your purposes.<eos> ~ What purpose would that be?<eos> ~ You were under pressure.<eos> You needed a result, didn't you?<eos> There's always pressure to find a killer.<eos> Hadn't you just been labelled<eos> Britain's worst cop by the national press?<eos> ~ One paper.
All the time.<eos> I'm trying to make it better.<eos> But... .. but I know I never can.<eos> You know?<eos> Alec'll be in the kitchen and I'll be by the front door.<eos> ~ If you're OK with that.<eos> ~ Are you sure?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> I've got a bit of butterflies, actually.<eos> ~ Really?
~ Where is Claire?<eos> What have you done with her?<eos> ~ We're not suspects.<eos> ~ We are not prisoners.<eos> ~ Get off him.<eos> ~ You all right?<eos> ~ Course he's all right.<eos> ~ I want you out.<eos> ~ Or what, you'll call the police?<eos> Out now!
Erm...<eos> Right, I met her in the arcade.<eos> I liked her dog, Vince.<eos> She let me visit her caravan.<eos> Have you ever met anyone else in that caravan?<eos> (Beth, listen.)<eos> Yes.<eos> Danny's dad, Mark.<eos> ~ What's he talking about?<eos> ~ Nothing.
~ She wanted to be there, in case Lisa came back.<eos> Let's go to the hotel.<eos> ~ How can they have just lost your booking?<eos> ~ Shut up, at least we got the last room!<eos> ~ I'll sleep in the car.<eos> ~ Don't be daft.<eos> ~ If Joe's legal team found out - ~ So?<eos> They've already accused us of it.<eos> ~ Don't be stupid.<eos> Especially not in your condition.
~ I was sorry to hear about you and Ricky.<eos> ~ It was a long time coming.<eos> ~ Well, going through something like this...<eos> ~ We were broken before then.<eos> All that cock of the walk, "every woman loves me" bullshit...<eos> Only so much any woman could take.<eos> Even over the fence, when he knew I was watching, with Claire.<eos> He'd check I could see.<eos> ~ I'm sorry, you never told us - ~ Even the moment his daughter was being killed...<eos> ~ At the wedding?
Why not?<eos> The business was in a state cos I wasn't paying to attention to it ~ and my life went out of control.<eos> ~ What do you mean?<eos> I used to follow her a little bit.<eos> Stand outside where she was.<eos> I'm not proud of it.<eos> Like when she was babysitting?<eos> Did you stand outside the Gillespies' house when she was there?<eos> Where were you on the night the girls disappeared?<eos> In hospital.
My name is Liv Moore, and I died, sort of<eos> I had a promising career and a great fiance.<eos> Then I went to the world's worst boat party and got turned into a zombie.<eos> Now I work at the morgue for access to brains, but brain eating has side effects.<eos> I take on the victim's personality traits And have visions which I use to help solve their murders.<eos> I work with a detective who thinks I'm a psychic and my boss, the medical examiner, the only person who knows my secret.<eos> I'm a crime-fighting zombie.<eos> Previously on iZombie...
Jerome's roommate, Eddie Cisco, disappeared four days ago.<eos> All right. I'm gonna walk this over to Missing Persons right now.<eos> Nice kicks.<eos> Have you seen my friend?<eos> We'll have you to him in no time.<eos> You a size 12?<eos> Be my guest.<eos> - What are we drinking?<eos> - This is a Mezcal made in some remote village in South America.<eos> Mexico.

What did you think of him?<eos> Well, he's a smart ass, withholding, evasive.<eos> When you've got nothing to hide, you tend to be open.<eos> Let's bring his friends in, find out more about him.<eos> Just a few basic questions.<eos> You can start with your full name, what you do, and your affiliation with Max Rager.<eos> Ren Smith.<eos> I'm kind of an all around action sports guy.<eos> Mainly motocross.<eos> Some stunt stuff.
I'm letting you down.<eos> I'm letting the city down, I know.<eos> Hey, I heard something.<eos> Like... Yeah, flash it this way.<eos> Down here, down here!<eos> Okay. Plan B.<eos> Keep the light up.<eos> So you got a place down south, huh?<eos> Nice?<eos> On the water?
Something happen to her?<eos> Ah... she was betrayed by the world, my man.<eos> Same thing that happened to us all.<eos> Besides... why dream of a cherry when you got peaches and plums dangling low everywhere you look?<eos> [chuckling] [muffled music] [chatter, laughter] Sam!<eos> Come on, join the fun.<eos> Mmm... You know, Bernard, he just got back from...<eos> Wait.<eos> Where was it, Bernie?<eos> Turkey?
No arguments.<eos> I confirmed C.O.D.'s on our female victims.<eos> Blunt force trauma to the head.<eos> Women had so many fractures to the body and skull, I almost lost count.<eos> It's not just the blunt force trauma--<eos> Winthrop's M.O.'s seemed to have changed as well.<eos> With his earlier victims, there's no sign of sexual activity.<eos> You found semen?<eos> Yeah.<eos> On both victims.
136 years from now.<eos> That's not what you want to know.<eos> Go ahead, Barry.<eos> Ask it.<eos> Why did you kill my mother?<eos> Because I hate you.<eos> Not you now.<eos> You years from now.<eos> - In the future.<eos> - In a future.
Your honesty.<eos> Your heart.<eos> You were always a hero.<eos> And your mom would be just as proud.<eos> And if she had a say in this, if she thought for one second that you going back to save her would mean you losing what makes you so special, she would never want that.<eos> Barry, what I hope for you, maybe the greatest thing that a father can hope for his son is that one day, you will become a father yourself.<eos> And then you will know...<eos> How much I truly love you.<eos> 98.6.<eos> Normal.
Hey, I know the kind of stuff that we were doing at his age, so I'm just looking out for the little man.<eos> Don't spend it all in one place, bro.<eos> Kelsey: So you just click on the doctor's name, and you get a bio and pic instantly.<eos> That's great.<eos> Look at that, and some little fun facts.<eos> I love that.<eos> Look at this guy, a Harvard man.<eos> (Chuckles) Simpatico.<eos> 'Cause I went there.<eos> To Harvard.
Now that we're off the shit list, we back to big balling, baby.<eos> Previously on House of Lies...
I just feel a little weird.<eos> Oh, mother of God, are we having this baby?<eos> Here, sit down.<eos> No, we are not even having this conversation, Doug.<eos> I just, I'm just having a little bit of pain.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay, all right, very interesting.<eos> Interesting how? Okay, what?<eos> Doug...<eos> Nothing, nothing.
Oh, you mean like those R-rated soft-focus, uh, porns?<eos> Uh, no, it's X-rated, but we cater to women's fantasies.<eos> Anyone's fantasies go unfulfilled?<eos> A disgruntled employee?<eos> Overeager fan, maybe?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Only problem that we've ever had was Josie Phillips.<eos> That's, uh, one of your stars, I take it?<eos> Yep, from Montana, I think.<eos> Last year.
Go on.<eos> Tell her.<eos> My dad wasn't driving when that kid got hit.<eos> I was.<eos> What?<eos> Then I took the blame and tried to keep him out of trouble.<eos> Bad enough when he got arrested the other day.<eos> Then I find out what they really did?<eos> Nuh-uh.<eos> Not in my house.
What'd you expect?<eos> He heard the shot, saw his partner on the ground.<eos> I didn't do that, man.<eos> I swear to God, I didn't shoot her.<eos> I was there. I know what happened.<eos> Then you know I didn't do it.<eos> Puts me the only friend you got right now, Stokes.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Tell me about Arthur Delacroix.<eos> Who?
What happened next.<eos> I was making my way around a vehicle to get over to them when I heard the shot.<eos> Did you see Officer Brasher draw her weapon?<eos> I did not.<eos> From my vantage point, I could only infer from her movements that's what she was doing.<eos> At that moment, when you heard the gunshot, were the suspect's hands still on the wall?<eos> Yes.<eos> Both hands?<eos> Both hands.<eos> On the wall.
-You got any needles or anything sharp?<eos> -Why are you so stressed?<eos> -I've got to get to the pub.<eos> Okay. You can leave shortly.<eos> How are things?<eos> -It's fine, I'm stressed.<eos> -Yeah, I understand that.<eos> -What have we got here?<eos> -Played the horses.<eos> -Horses?
-I figured you lived here.<eos> -Yes, unfortunately, but so it goes.<eos> -Okay.<eos> How are things?<eos> A lot has happened.<eos> I'm gonna be a dad.<eos> She's seven months pregnant, so it's just a couple of months left.<eos> I've stopped using the good, I have joined the program.<eos> Yeah it was a big deal, it was heavy, it was hard.<eos> But, really...
-Yes indeed.<eos> -When was the last time you were locked up?<eos> -It's been a while.<eos> I was in the clear last time, but got snitched out by the guy I lived with.<eos> -Anyone I might know?<eos> -The snitch?<eos> -Doesn't matter.<eos> He's at Skrubban.<eos> -The treatment center?<eos> Nah, the graveyard.
That's him.<eos> That's who?<eos> The interested party.<eos> You just let me do all the talking, and we'll close the deal right here, right now.<eos> Raylan Givens, home seller, meet Ty Walker, home buyer.<eos> Ah, came to your senses, did you?<eos> Decided to take my offer.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> We're here to talk to you about your safe-deposit box, Calhoun.<eos> Safe-deposit box?
You're damn right I did.<eos> Why?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I heard about that bank got robbed!<eos> You hid what you stoled on my property, and you wonder why I took it?<eos> I should have burned it. No.<eos> Oh, I know you didn't burn it.<eos> I figured if you went to all the trouble to put it here, risk me getting caught and sent back to prison, oh, it must be awful important to you.<eos> Where are they now, Ava?<eos> In the truck, on the seat!
Well, you know, I'm kind of tired.<eos> Why don't we talk about this tomorrow at the bank?<eos> My client, he's impatient.<eos> It'd mean an awful lot to me if we could just talk right now.<eos> Let me help you with those.<eos> Oh, I can get it.<eos> No. I insist.<eos> There. Fingers.<eos> So, my client was wondering if the police had said anything to you at all about who they think might have done this robbery.<eos> The police?
You know I like to keep busy.<eos> Making breakfast has roused the cooking bug.<eos> Yeah, I was thinking maybe tonight I'd do my fried chicken and sweet potatoes.<eos> Ooh! Better than the colonel himself.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where you going?<eos> There's something I want to give you.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Go on, sit down.<eos> Now...
Everyone hates me.<eos> You saw the poll?<eos> Did you vote for me, too?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> I gotta keep you around.<eos> Gotta have one unattainable hottie to keep me grounded.<eos> Especially with Riley being gone.<eos> Last night, I left my friend alone because I just wanted what I wanted.<eos> It's always all about me.<eos> - Or your girlish charm.
Attacking you.<eos> I thought you were supposed to help me be less afraid.<eos> Are you afraid now?<eos> No. Good.<eos> What's changed?<eos> Yesterday I was so embarrassed and it just kept getting worse and worse.<eos> And then, I realized that I'm here.<eos> I'm alive, I'm breathing.<eos> And I make my own choices.<eos> Hello?
Kingpin eats.<eos> The Joker eats.<eos> Bane probably doesn't because of his mask, but there's probably some sort of, like, nutrient...<eos> Hey, Noah, can we focus for one second?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Well, Mr. B may have seen us on his laptop.<eos> If he thought we could expose him, maybe he found a way to implicate Audrey as payback...<eos> Mr. Branson!<eos> Hey! Hi!
Audrey, we just have a couple of questions about Rachel Murray.<eos> We were hoping that you could help us answer them.<eos> So the murder investigation's finally happening?<eos> Good.<eos> You two were working on a video project together.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, we were.<eos> What was it about?<eos> Growing up weird.<eos> Life.
Tyler and Nina had a video of your dad doing things he should not have been doing.<eos> Will kept the video, and he picked up where they left off.<eos> This is all the money you've paid so far, and the last existing copy of the video.<eos> I really don't wanna die for doing the right thing.<eos> Remember, there's a killer on the loose.<eos> It's not the story I came for, but it's a hell of a bonus chapter.<eos> Piper!<eos> Help!<eos> 1x07<eos> - In the Trenches
Anger or otherwise.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are you actually using fear of death to get in my pants?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Unless that would comfort you.<eos> You're unbelievable.<eos> I'll take that as a "No."<eos> Hey, let me ask you something.<eos> Do you find Shake'n Jake's story a little bit odd?<eos> How so?
Mom, the Deputy is waiting.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, um, take these.<eos> Just in case.<eos> I'm here for you.<eos> - If you need anything. - I know.<eos> Sheriff Hudson, could I have a moment?<eos> I'll have a press statement later today.<eos> No, I don't want any information. I'm here to give you some.<eos> About what?
_<eos> _<eos> Hello, Emma.<eos> Previously on Scream...
Bad things happen here when you ask questions.<eos> Six months ago,<eos> Maple was on the verge of collapse.<eos> 80% of the town worked for the textile factory, but business was moving overseas.<eos> Then a corporation bought it,<eos> Carrow.<eos> Saved everyone's jobs, saved Maple.<eos> Then things changed.<eos> People protesting Carrow were killed.<eos> In a manner.
You're coming down pretty hard.<eos> You're going to get the chills.<eos> - You're good at this. - Hmm.<eos> Who was the addict?<eos> You're not the first woman I've had to score drugs for.<eos> Go home, Johnny.<eos> Doctor's orders.<eos> You're ready.<eos> - Still question my faith?<eos> - Your sanity, maybe.
Why do i have a sudden urge to dump tea into a harbor?<eos> What's she talking about?<eos> Colonist propaganda.<eos> Pay her no mind, we have zombie tests to conduct.<eos> Shall we?<eos> I assume you're employing koch's postulates in trying to determine Whether we're dealing with a neurotropic virus Or perhaps some kind of bacterial pathogen.<eos> And what the hell am i talking about?<eos> I thought you were a musician...<eos> Apparently one with quite the keen scientific mind.<eos> In his stomach. Ah.
We're here to rescue you.<eos> -Lieutenant, you okay?<eos> -I'm fine.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I gave the signal five minutes ago.<eos> Doesn't matter. Situation's resolved.<eos> It's okay.<eos> More good guys.<eos> Where'd you find them?<eos> In the treehouse, out back.
We're having a bad enough day.<eos> If there's a problem in Detroit, the White House has to get out in front of it.<eos> There is a problem in Detroit, and no one is ever gonna hear about it.<eos> Yeah, I hope not, for your sake.<eos> Do you even know how many problems<eos> I have solved for you, Mike? 853.<eos> All enemy combatants, many on American soil, identified by Research, and handled by me.<eos> And by "handled," you realize I mean killed, right?<eos> There's no need for this kind of talk.<eos> Of killing?
No.<eos> [Panting] A bush kid!<eos> Which one says I am rich enough to be invited but not rich enough that you could ask me to donate money?<eos> I think the one with the Tokyo Disney on the label.<eos> Mom, I don't want to ride the bus anymore.<eos> I want to carpool, and here's 50 reasons why I...<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> ! Well, what can I say, you caught me in a charitable mood.<eos> But not too charitable.
- Them.<eos> You think I'm a traitor?<eos> Tell me, then.<eos> Give and take.<eos> If you answer my question, I will answer yours.<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> Before this, you had a boyfriend.<eos> My father was strict.<eos> I studied at a convent school.<eos> Oh!
Kalpa?<eos> Kalpa.<eos> - Hey, lovebirds.<eos> - What's up?<eos> Hey, Youpie.<eos> - How dare you?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Do you think I don't know?<eos> - With my friends.<eos> - Your friends?
Here we go-o-o-o.<eos> Mighty spirit.<eos> Dickie Bennett, this is archangel Raylan, here to deliver unto thee a loaded-up commissary in exchange for your cooperation in a federal criminal investigation. Message received, but I'm afraid what you ask, it's ... it's just ...<eos> it's too g-great.<eos> It really is.<eos> I cannot see a way to answer your call.<eos> Search your soul, numbnuts.<eos> Can you not see the lord herself hath damned me with... incipient diabetes?<eos> - You shitting me?<eos> - Negatory.
Are you sure... you don't want to crawl into this Egyptian cotton, order a pint of ice cream?<eos> Come on, now.<eos> They got free cable.<eos> I think I just want to get home, sleep in my o... in our own bed.<eos> All right.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Duffy said that Katherine Hale wanted to have lunch with you today.<eos> What did you two talk about?<eos> - Mhm. Nothing.
Sempo Sugihara, you say?<eos> Yes<eos> We have no one with that name at the Foreign Ministry of Japan.<eos> Neither presently, nor in the past.

It could be a talk show host who was my best friend.<eos> Was?<eos> I'm life-threatening, Trish.<eos> Steer clear of me.<eos> - I don't do that.<eos> - Please.<eos> I can't risk you.<eos> It had the name on it.<eos> What?<eos> The door.
Kilgrave's taking precautions because he knows you're onto Malcolm?<eos> No, or Malcolm would be dead.<eos> But he's not gonna let me sneak up on him.<eos> So I need to deliver the sufentanil with a long-range dart gun.<eos> Won't work if he's on the move.<eos> A long-range sniper attack takes setup.<eos> Your subject needs to be in a predetermined location, preferably removed from civilians.<eos> So, I guess you're over him trying to kill you and all.<eos> It'll take a pistol.<eos> Up close and personal.
Why do you care?<eos> I know a lot about holding on to shit.<eos> It'll only hurt you and everyone around you.<eos> Luke...<eos> There's a reason, an explanation...<eos> Charles Wallace.<eos> -What?<eos> -Charles Wallace.<eos> He was the bus driver.<eos> In the accident?
Can't say the same for him.<eos> I'll call an ambulance.<eos> - No, don't.<eos> - No, don't.<eos> Kilgrave's not far.<eos> You call it in, he gets further away, and then we're stuck sitting in questioning.<eos> She's right.<eos> I'll secure the scene, get some guys in who won't muck up the evidence.<eos> Someone cut the fail-safe wire.<eos> Oh, God.
Your provincial yet snappy repartee.<eos> We make a good team.<eos> You're a lot of shitty things, but I never thought you were delusional.<eos> Oh, I see things very clearly.<eos> Not if you think I could ever feel anything for you other than pure disgust.<eos> Well, that's crap.<eos> I never, not for one second...<eos> No, not one second.<eos> Eighteen.<eos> In what universe?

It's me.<eos> Trish?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> How are you even standing?<eos> You were in the hospital.<eos> No, I'm okay. Kozlov's a great doctor.<eos> Your pupils are dilated.<eos> Yeah, that's because I'm on meds.<eos> Well, I did almost die, after all.<eos> - What kind of meds?
Forever.<eos> I guess what she really wanted was an audience to watch her die.<eos> She killed herself.<eos> With a glass.<eos> With the stem of the glass.<eos> That was her choice.<eos> Nobody told her to do it.<eos> I guess she couldn't live with the guilt.<eos> A lot of weird shit has been going down.<eos> How so?
She'd wither away like someone dying of thirst or starvation.<eos> Be a certain ring of hell, designed specially for her.<eos> Or maybe I'll just kill her.<eos> Shall we, Albert?<eos> Let the experiment begin.<eos> I thought about you.<eos> I mean, I knew it would never happen.<eos> But I couldn't help... picturing us.<eos> Like, on an actual date.<eos> Bowling.
You know, he left this here for you to find.<eos> Subtle, right?<eos> It's docked at the Hudson Ferry Terminal. I found the bills.<eos> And he wants you to go there.<eos> He must be feeling confident.<eos> At least now it'll end.<eos> One way or another.<eos> And here we are for the last and final round.<eos> Too afraid to look me in the eye?<eos> Present arms.
Just interpreting.<eos> You know sign language?<eos> My parents are deaf.<eos> Well, whatever language you use, let's try to keep it civil, shall we?<eos> - Office hours are - _<eos> - _ - Tuesday, Thursday, noon to 2:00,<eos> - _ - sciences building.<eos> - Now, technically I'm there to answer any questions about the week's material,<eos> - _ - but if you want to come and talk to me about...<eos> - _ - French bulldogs,
I think I heard something about that.<eos> Is that machine working?<eos> Can I get a cup of coffee?<eos> Sure.<eos> I like the name,<eos> "Cracked Mug."<eos> It feels right for this neighborhood.<eos> Cracked but still here.<eos> Yeah, just like me.<eos> Me too.
_<eos> Golan.<eos> Gola... _<eos> I'm still on parole.<eos> This is so messed up.<eos> What the hell are they gonna do to him in that place?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Well, now's as good a Goddamn time as any to let me know.<eos> It's all about the end of days.<eos> The what?
They just told me he's in a... an acute post-traumatic coma.<eos> He has about a 50/50 chance of recovery.<eos> Kind of ratty.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Um... we need to talk about who might have wanted Derek dead.<eos> He's a radiologist.<eos> It's the most boring job in medicine.<eos> You never deal with patients, so no one's ever mad.<eos> Well, um, in his personal life?
You could tell by how much I would eat and drink and just sit on the couch.<eos> Yeah, thank God that never happened.<eos> Wow.<eos> He doesn't want to be my dad, he just wants to be a kid like me.<eos> Almost makes me not want to prank him.<eos> Almost.<eos> Touché.<eos> If you wedgie me, my friend will beat you up.<eos> That's not your friend, it's your screwed-up dad.<eos> Pretty sad, really.
A while back, yeah.<eos> - Well, see, whatever your doctor gave you could be what's making you dizzy.<eos> Sometimes medicines have side effects.<eos> I know.<eos> The pills I was taking to make me feel better were making me feel awful.<eos> - Wait, it's also dangerous to stop taking something without consulting a doctor.<eos> The doctor was as bad as the pills he gave me.<eos> I consulted Cassie.<eos> And she mixed me up some stuff and my blood pressure has been fine for years.<eos> Yeah, textbook perfect.
In the beginning, a star fell from heaven and changed us.<eos> Made us angels and gave us a new destiny:<eos> to stop the Apocalypse and the Devil himself.<eos> We must pass God's test and prove humanity is still worth saving.<eos> For we are the Messengers.<eos> Previously on The Messengers:
- Wait.<eos> So if Rose broke a seal, then you're saying...<eos> She isn't a Messenger.<eos> She's a Horseman.<eos> If that's legit, it means there's one more Horseman than what we thought.<eos> And one less chance to stop them.<eos> When did this happen?<eos> Didn't anyone think it was strange that Rose was conveniently out of town the day Leland Schiller got out of prison?<eos> Where did she say she was?<eos> Seattle.

Just like we planned.<eos> And we're backup if things go bad.<eos> That's just it... the guards aren't the problem.<eos> I can tell you how to get to Zahir.<eos> But I'm not sure, once you get there, he's gonna play along.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I don't know if it's 'cause he's been tortured and locked up, but the guy seems pretty unhinged.<eos> How so?<eos> The guards are afraid of him.<eos> Even in a straightjacket.

The rest of the space is all taken up with other people's stuff.<eos> Tins of powdered milk and I don't know what.<eos> Well, that's not very season of goodwill.<eos> Oww!<eos> Pass me the scissors.<eos> I'm not biting this, it's too close to your backside.<eos> A high temperature and a nasty cough.<eos> But what we don't want at her age is pneumonia.<eos> We've been more worried about her confusion<eos> - than her physical health lately.
Well, there's just a word that no-one likes singing.<eos> It's in that line.<eos> And it begins with a "B".<eos> What, "breast"?<eos> - HE CHUCKLES - ANGELA:<eos> Da-da! - Dad!<eos> - PHONE RINGS - I'll get that.<eos> - Dad, I've gone bright red!<eos> - Hello?<eos> - In the privacy of my own home.
You mean Sister Monica Joan?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I could kick myself, I really could.<eos> If we get her back safely, she can put up next year's tree on Easter Sunday if she likes.<eos> I just keep running through everything I said.<eos> I keep running over everything she said when she was ill.<eos> Delirium's always interesting.<eos> Sometimes, the truth comes out.<eos> Was she talking about her mother?<eos> Mostly.
Are you on probation, too, Sheriff?<eos> He needs to deposit a sample.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> No problem.<eos> Just need to speak with Mr. Holden when you're done with him.<eos> He'll be a minute.<eos> A male officer should be here to go in with you, Daniel.<eos> Just killing time, Sheriff?<eos> Just want to talk about George.<eos> Melton.
And then he signed a plea deal that put that in the official record forever, and now he's living on my couch.<eos> So, that's me.<eos> I'm Amantha Holden, and I've never been in a hot-dog race at a baseball stadium.<eos> I'msuitedup .<eos> We 'rereadytodothis.<eos> Iknowthislooksalittle ridiculous, but believe me, youreallyhavetoprotect yourself when using this stuff.<eos> Wow.<eos> Looks better already.<eos> You don't think I'm in over my head, do you?<eos> Not in this pool.
Well, kind of got to get back to work, Carl.<eos> Might have some more questions for you later, Trey.<eos> Sure.<eos> Anytime, Carl.<eos> Prefer it not be at work, but whatever you got to do.<eos> Need to clean as you go.<eos> Dad's dictums.<eos> You'd better get used to it.<eos> How are things going these days?<eos> In general?
I am Emily.<eos> Emily.<eos> For those who cannot afford the cloning process, many of our elderly undergo a full digital transfer of consciousness, where they can experience a safe, extended lifespan of hundreds of years.<eos> Our grandfather's digital consciousness currently resides in this cube, where I upload the latest films and books for him to enjoy every week.<eos> Grandpa!<eos> We are also able to download correspondence from him.<eos> Over 1,000 letters were received during his first hour in storage, as this was approximately 4 years time inside the cube.<eos> I will read one of his letters to you now.<eos> "Oh.<eos> Oh God.

And ask him to pray for me.<eos> Every day I miss the Cardinal of York.<eos> A man who can get 1,000 pounds from the king.<eos> It's only a tenth of what is owed the Cardinal for over a decade.<eos> And not so much when you have a cardinal to move. Hm.<eos> Where will the rest come from?<eos> How much of your own money will you put into this?<eos> Some debts are not to be reckoned.<eos> I heard a rumour, recently, about someone you know.<eos> Thomas Wyatt.
Take my advice, before she does, turn around and walk the other way.<eos> Cheer it up, can't you?<eos> - What did you just do?<eos> -I hit Mark Smeaton. Only with one finger.<eos> Who?<eos> Oh! Is that his name?<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> -Utopia.<eos> Oh, what was the talk?<eos> The vices and follies of women.
She does, doesn't she?<eos> I hear she can tell you where your dead relatives are.<eos> If it's in Heaven, she speaks with a higher voice, if in Hell, with a deep voice.<eos> She can also tell what sins weigh upon a man as soon as she meets him.<eos> What would she make of you?<eos> How was Antwerp?<eos> Glad to be home.<eos> Oh. For show.<eos> In case I got stopped.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Centre seam.
Bankers don't have armies.<eos> Neither will you, without any money.<eos> My lord, you hold your earldom from the King.<eos> Your task is to secure the north, to defend us against Scotland.<eos> If you cannot ensure these things, the King will take your land and your titles and give them to someone who will do the job that you cannot do.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> He respects all ancient titles.<eos> How can I explain this to you...?<eos> The world is not run from where you think it is.<eos> From border fortresses.

We'll meet there to discuss points of a treaty.<eos> Last time we met, Wolsey arranged everything.<eos> I thought perhaps you could help organise things this time?<eos> Lean on me, Your Majesty.<eos> We'll take mass at Canterbury.<eos> Let the people see their king.<eos> Do you know this woman?<eos> I used to.<eos> She reminds me of someone I knew long ago.<eos> In Antwerp.
So, join us.<eos> ~ Oh, well, I think I'm...<eos> ~ Oh, no.<eos> She wouldn't want to.<eos> Of course she would.<eos> So, Rachel, this means I'll be needing a new sergeant.<eos> She's not a sergeant.<eos> Ever hear of sergeants' exams, John?<eos> You're taking your exam?<eos> Next month.
The funeral's jiggered him.<eos> We won't stay long, Bridget, I promise.<eos> Norman, Norman, you've got company.<eos> How, George, what fettle?<eos> Canny fettle, Norman, no bother.<eos> Listen to him, we'll get you talking Pitmatic before were finished.<eos> Are you all right, bonny lad?<eos> Ah, yeah, fit as a lop there, Mr Carlin.<eos> Norman, we wanted to talk to you about the Factories Safety Board.<eos> ~ Those sods?
He put a pony on the third race.<eos> Doesn't happen very often.<eos> He chases his bets.<eos> Makes us uneasy.<eos> It's like watching them jumping off a cliff.<eos> Is he?<eos> Jumping off a cliff.<eos> When you take the money, you try not to think about the look in their eyes, but, aye, there's some you feel sorry for.<eos> ~ Was he one of them?<eos> ~ Jimmy?
Newcastle!<eos> ~ Ah, right.<eos> ~ He wanted to rip it down and rebuild it.<eos> Like Richard Grainger and T Dan.<eos> His heroes.<eos> Promise us one thing.<eos> You'll not let anybody con you into thinking Scott took his own life.<eos> What was your last sight of him on that night?<eos> Staggering away from the restaurant 2:00 in the morning, blood on his head from hitting the wall, cursing us, cursing the world, cursing God, cursing the sky, singing at the top of his voice.<eos> Which direction?
I gave them a good blast before it ran out.<eos> ~ I was top shot in my troop, National Service made a man of me.<eos> ~ Right.<eos> Oh, aye. I got a few rounds in, for sure.<eos> Bloody hooligans.<eos> So he came in right past you, the gunman, but you didn't see his face?<eos> I saw his boots.<eos> Work wear.<eos> No business being in my bank.<eos> Your bank?
Where to?<eos> Home, please.<eos> On your own?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Gemma's still in London.<eos> She's coming down next week.<eos> It's happening then, is it?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I'm going to look after her.<eos> Her and the kids.
That's Carlton Street?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> ~ No, no, no, no.<eos> You get on down to Raven Street, show them the photograph, ask them about the skins.<eos> ~ I'll see you later.<eos> ~ Right.<eos> Raven Street?<eos> Great.<eos> In these shoes.
I don't know what you think she's done, but she's all right, that girl.<eos> But she is a skinhead, yeah?<eos> They're not all a bad crowd.<eos> What's their thing?<eos> They were born into slavery.<eos> That's how they see it.<eos> Working class with no work, oppressed by the black and the blue, the priests and the police.<eos> That's how come she got along with an old squeeze-box like me.<eos> What did you talk about?<eos> Music mostly.
He saw me.<eos> And you were letting him go.<eos> So you re-commissioned 50 Sten guns for him?<eos> No, I only did the first one.<eos> He said he had some bloke down the docks with a machine shop, he'd do the rest for him.<eos> So I showed him how to do it...<eos> He said he'd kill me mum.<eos> He said he'd kill you.<eos> I know where he is.<eos> In London?
Several bodies were dragged through here, away from the path.<eos> We go on foot from here.<eos> Feel like looking for a needle in a haystack.<eos> Saracen. What do you know of this beast?<eos> We called it, jinn.<eos> Huh?<eos> It's mean, demon.<eos> Have you actually encountered one?<eos> Yes.<eos> In Jerusalem.
You think I'm gonna forget about this, huh?<eos> Is that what you think? !<eos> You have evidence against Agent Peterson?<eos> You can pick up your firearms on the way out.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Bordick.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You look like you're in a hurry.<eos> What's the rush?<eos> - Nothing.
About everything?<eos> i'm not.<eos> Yeah, but... We're not gonna figure that out tonight, are we?<eos> Stay awhile.<eos> We'll talk about it in the morning.<eos> Where you been?<eos> Went for a walk.<eos> Baby?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.
- Angie, I...<eos> - I know what you told me... a lie so that Tommy could get away with murder.<eos> - She left town. - Right.<eos> To a magical place where ATMs and credit cards don't exist.<eos> Even if you did give her money, there'd still be a trail, a hotel receipt, a plane ticket, something.<eos> I know why he did it.<eos> Fuck it, I'm probably responsible.<eos> He killed her because I asked her to testify against him.<eos> I asked her to testify about this.<eos> And this.
Now y'all know where the fuck you're going? - Yeah.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Get to work.<eos> Yo, the news you were waiting for just walked through the front door, man.<eos> Buy yourself a bus ticket, nigga, 'cause you need to get back in town ASAP.<eos> Felipe. [speaking Spanish]<eos> _<eos> New Jersey.<eos> _<eos> Teterboro.

And the truth is...<eos> I don't think he deserves it.<eos> He was in that room with Lobos, and he is a major drug dealer.<eos> And sometimes people deserve to pay the price.<eos> I think you want me to protect someone who legally, morally, fundamentally doesn't deserve protection.<eos> I think we should stop talking about this tonight.<eos> We can't play this game forever.<eos> This is the only thing I can think about.<eos> Hey.<eos> The only thing?
- What about Jude?<eos> - I lied.<eos> I told him that I had to be out of the system.<eos> And he's been in the system, so he understands.<eos> - I should have never called you that night.<eos> - Yeah, but you did.<eos> Is Robert here?<eos> So, uh, how'd you get all the way over here?<eos> I took the bus.<eos> A couple, actually.
So Callie, I hear that you've had a change of heart about who you want to live with.<eos> I took Tasha from the park on Christmas Eve.<eos> But right away I knew it was a mistake.<eos> So I took her back to her foster home that night and watched her walk up to the door.<eos> When her foster parents opened the door and I knew she was safe, I ran off.<eos> I see.<eos> And was anyone with you?<eos> - Did anyone help?<eos> - No.<eos> Really?
And finally, I will transform you so that your husband and your son won't recognize you anymore.<eos> You can't.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> You already are.<eos> Think about the risk you took at that freezer.<eos> You had no idea that the gas would ignite or not.<eos> It was dumb luck that you got out of there alive.<eos> Either you will try that again... And I will watch you kill yourself, or you will quit...<eos> And I will watch you wither and fade.<eos> Either way,
Were they?<eos> She says they weren't, and I believe her, and that it was the other driver's fault.<eos> Did she go to the E.R., get checked out?<eos> Look, Harry, kids are stupid.<eos> They do stupid things, as you well know.<eos> - Luckily, everybody's okay.<eos> - I'm not okay!<eos> How about some parental supervision?<eos> - Where the hell was Reggie?<eos> - At work.
Get some coffee.<eos> - If it's warm, I'll take it.<eos> - Well, come on in.<eos> Take it black?<eos> Every cop I've ever known takes it black.<eos> - Black's great. - Mm.<eos> - You know a lot of cops?<eos> - Uh, when we lived in L.A., I did.<eos> Worked 30 years for city fire, retired as a station commander.<eos> - What division?
It's been like one minute.<eos> That's it?<eos> I thought we were just supposed to be answering questions.<eos> Well, they also suggest keeping eye contact for four minutes to improve intimacy. I don't know.<eos> It's weird.<eos> - Let's just do the questions.<eos> - Oh, thank god.<eos> Okay, let's see. Um...<eos> "Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?"<eos> Really? Wow.
"Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?"<eos> Really? Wow.<eos> Well, this is gonna be...<eos> A bit of a stretch,<eos> - so bear with me here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Cancer.<eos> - All right, your turn.<eos> "Would you like to be famous?<eos> In what way?"
A lot of questions from his last year.<eos> - He was probably going...<eos> - Oh, stop.<eos> You dad's past is a door I just...<eos> I don't feel the need to open again.<eos> This is April's last week at home.<eos> I just want to enjoy this time with my wonderful daughters.<eos> Okay.<eos> Most improved."<eos> - From the gymnastics coach.
I admit it might be weird to bring your grandma to a strip club, which, by the way, it is!<eos> Hi, fellas.<eos> My entire life is at a crossroads, okay?<eos> I have one week left at home.<eos> This could be one of my only nights to be a single girl out with her single girlfriends.<eos> Do you realize that I could never be single again!<eos> This is my last freaking hurrah, and that's why we gotta do it right.<eos> Hey, come on, it's normal to be nervous before your wedding, yeah, you're never gonna be single again, but you're marrying Leo!<eos> Think of all the exciting things that come with that.<eos> Like what? Babies?
You should get up there and dance with him.<eos> Right.<eos> Like anybody could just get up and dance.<eos> Hey, hey, our friend's getting married!<eos> - Who's the bride to be?<eos> - Me!<eos> Me, me! I'm the bride!<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
You know, I always thought that "Phantom Menace" was the best "Star Wars."<eos> But you know, I get it, because you and April are just friends.<eos> And what's great, dimples...<eos> Dom...<eos> Domples, is that we can be friends now, because I have nothing to worry about.<eos> You don't want April back.<eos> - I do.<eos> I'm still in love with her, and I do want her back.<eos> Leo!<eos> Oh my God.
I hate that we're keeping secrets from each other on our wedding day.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - It means we're human.<eos> You want honesty?<eos> Ask me something, anything.<eos> Are you marrying me as a gift?<eos> Because I'm dying?<eos> Am I one of your Robin Hood projects?<eos> Is that really what you think of me?<eos> Of this wedding?
Maybe we've been a little lazy about cleaning up this past month, but we just moved in.<eos> We're still in our honeymoon phase.<eos> Which I love.<eos> I love.<eos> Especially because we got robbed of an actual honeymoon.<eos> But it's time for our next phase.<eos> Like making the dining room table a functional place to eat.<eos> Oh, hang on though, because that is my favorite spot to stack things.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Even more than the sink?
You know, you really didn't have to go through all that effort.<eos> I would've tried to help your friend anyway.<eos> But I'm glad you did.<eos> Honey, I'm... home...<eos> Hey.<eos> I felt bad we had to miss out on Italy, so...<eos> Way to one-up me on the system.<eos> Here, come here.<eos> There's an oar there.<eos> Oh, my god.
Way to one-up me on the system.<eos> Here, come here.<eos> There's an oar there.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Sorry I've been all over the place lately.<eos> It's just a scary time, not being in treatment.<eos> No, I-I get it.<eos> I know what it's like.<eos> And I also know what I signed up for.<eos> "In sickness and in health."
I'll call Beth or Natalie.<eos> They're packing up my stuff.<eos> I'll see if they can bring it by today.<eos> Okay... okay.<eos> I'm really sorry about your brother-in-law, Bren.<eos> I wish you could've met him.<eos> He was just like, so full of life.<eos> Well, he's... in a better place now?<eos> Where?<eos> In the ground?
- The low pressure area...<eos> - They're talking about three feet of snow.<eos> We could be in this house for a while.<eos> Sunny and 60 one day, freak blizzard the next.<eos> Welcome to New England, Mae.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Well, I'm glad I stocked the fridge, though I don't know.<eos> Can the family survive on hummus and s'mores alone?<eos> Oh, well, you know, during a snow storm, Tequila definitely moves to the top of the food pyramid,<eos> or the bottom.
Oh my God.<eos> Ape.<eos> Oh, hey, you can go.<eos> I got this.<eos> If there's nothing in the book, then why did he get rid of it?<eos> I know.<eos> There was something in there.<eos> Bet we have a brother.<eos> I always wanted a brother.<eos> Not like this, obviously.
He's at the Beacon Motel, room 12.<eos> We won't know if it's our guy until you make him woge.<eos> Oh, I'll make him woge.<eos> Down on the ground now!<eos> On the ground!<eos> You're under arrest for murder.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you...<eos> - You killed three people.<eos> - In a court of law.
Hey, what is it that you do?<eos> I mean, the reason that you left.<eos> The work thing.<eos> I don't think I've ever asked you that.<eos> What is it that you... What do you actually do?<eos> What do you do to afford all of this?<eos> Simon.<eos> Are you not curious?<eos> I'm afraid that you've caught me in a lie.<eos> A lie?
I got the right place.<eos> I just need to speak to him, please.<eos> - Speak to who? - Gordo.<eos> Your husband.<eos> Gordon.<eos> Get him down here.<eos> My husband's name is Mike.<eos> Mike?<eos> The dog's tag says Mr. Bojangles?<eos> Like the song?
You sound like a governess in fear of dismissal.<eos> You sound like a guilty party, who's trying to throw me off the scent.<eos> Is something on your mind, Robert?<eos> You seem a bit troubled lately.<eos> Do I?<eos> Well, maybe I am.<eos> To be honest, I'm starting to ask myself how much longer we can go on with it all.<eos> - Well, go on with what?<eos> - The household.<eos> The servants.
I see.<eos> Well...<eos> Thank you very much for putting in a word, m'lord.<eos> If I hear anything more, I'll make sure Daisy knows it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Poor man.<eos> To have his whole future hanging in the balance, at his time of life.<eos> These are days of uncertainty.<eos> - How was John when you spoke to him?<eos> - In a state.
- If he know something, he gonna tell me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's one other thing.<eos> So I did a solid for that Puerto Rican motherfucker Víbora, right?<eos> After I did it, he came with a offer about falling back on Ghost and Tommy.<eos> - No shit.<eos> - Real shit.<eos> Ghost and Tommy got a revolt going on their hands, man.<eos> You think we should tell them?<eos> Hell, no.
Just turquoise costume stuff.<eos> How does he get all this?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But it's kind of fun.<eos> Arriving here.<eos> Smash, remove panel, take out the lockbox.<eos> Smash the lockbox.<eos> $3.4 million in loose diamonds.<eos> Which he takes before making his escape, stopping first to smash down the security camera.<eos> Basically correct?
White pine.<eos> But you stained them.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> Had Jason been working on them recently?<eos> The floor?<eos> No.<eos> He had white pine splinters under his fingernails.<eos> Seems to me that a savings account would yield a higher rate of return.<eos> I had no idea that was there.<eos> Jo: The hiding space or the money?
There has to be some mistake.<eos> And it seems your father knew of the collection's provenance, which likely explains why he was so secretive.<eos> This can't be true.<eos> They were both...<eos> Good men.<eos> Henry Morgan!<eos> Hello, John!<eos> It's been ages.<eos> Where have you been keeping yourself?<eos> At home, mostly.
It's disgusting what some people will do for money.<eos> Please tell me it isn't true.<eos> Henry, it is not that simple.<eos> I'm a learned man, father.<eos> There are no complexities here.<eos> Are you or are you not engaged in the slave trade? !<eos> If the answer was "no," you would have said so already.<eos> Wait.<eos> You always had a gift for seeing the truth in things.<eos> Except my father.
It's all...<eos> Gone.<eos> Along with our suspect.<eos> All right, we got a BOLO out on your art dealer, Julian Glausser.<eos> Also notified the Fed's art crime unit in case this guy tries to move anything on the black market.<eos> Smart thing would be to get them out of the country, wait for things to die down.<eos> We'll keep an eye on the train stations and the airports.<eos> You know, I'm thinking with a load this size, he might try and move it the same way the Nazis did.<eos> I'm supposed to guess?<eos> By boat.
There.<eos> A faint contusion around the mouth, Hidden by the beard.<eos> A hand, perhaps.<eos> He was unconscious, So it would've only taken a slight pressure.<eos> So our killer was in the apartment.<eos> Mm. Hey.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Not eating breakfast at my desk.<eos> I dig this new way of fighting crime.<eos> Yes, about that.
Someone so much as picks their nose on this island,<eos> We can catch them.<eos> That's a comforting thought. Like it or not, the age of anonymity is over.<eos> Liz: I didn't see any of this online.<eos> Your real life, dr. Morgan, Or just a deeper level of your disguise?<eos> Hot.<eos> You're into blondes.<eos> That's no business of yours.<eos> Okay. Let's talk my business.<eos> My death certificate.
Well, when it was built, it was state-of-the-art.<eos> You should've seen it.<eos> It was just like...<eos> What the hell?<eos> Thank you.<eos> There is not one article of clothing in this closet.<eos> A Technics SL-220... 40 years old.<eos> Like it just came out of the box.<eos> We had the exact same one.<eos> In the shop.
I mean, it's totally cool if you guys are.<eos> You'd automatically be my favorite couple ever.<eos> You know, and then if you had any single lady friends, we could double-date.<eos> I'm obviously looking for 8s and above.<eos> Lucas.<eos> That's the last we'll speak of it.<eos> But at least you know how I feel.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Tarrytown.
Detect organic material, yeah?<eos> Do you mind if we turn off the lights?<eos> It's okay.<eos> He loves a black light.<eos> Blair had a cut on her hand.<eos> She was cut here.<eos> But it wasn't from a pottery shard.<eos> We found particulates of iron.<eos> Iron?<eos> Not in this collection.
So you paid the guard to stop her.<eos> Why was it so important to you?<eos> It's because of this.<eos> This ledger belonged to Dr. Josef Mengele.<eos> You remember the camps, Henry.<eos> It's the smell that I remember most...<eos> The smell of death.<eos> Its pages are filled with experiments too horrific to imagine.<eos> One detail caught my attention...<eos> About a patient.
You know how overprotective I can be.<eos> But I'd be a fool not to accept your friend's apology and contribution.<eos> Every penny counts.<eos> That it does.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> I would've come down, but...<eos> Victoria's still there?<eos> - Yes, she is.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - Exactly that.
He has a strange effect on Louise, almost like...<eos> She's scared of him.<eos> God, I would love a second opinion.<eos> Would you join us for dinner tonight?<eos> If you need me, I'm there.<eos> Depending on how things unfold, this could become your farewell take-down.<eos> David?<eos> I think I was wrong.<eos> About what?<eos> Tonight?
without too much twang.<eos> I just left the club.<eos> I overheard Louise and her brother arguing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She called me and told me all about it.<eos> Seems Lyman went a little Sybil on her after I left.<eos> But I told her that I would talk him down tonight.<eos> What?<eos> Did you know that Louise was institutionalized?<eos> At Claremont?
I'm so, so sorry.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You're fine.<eos> You're fine.<eos> You understand now why I need to get her home.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well...<eos> Guess you were right.<eos> Actually...
Is this hell?<eos> If we're still here, it's because Shaw wants us here.<eos> Allow me to apologize for not giving you a proper welcome.<eos> It has been a very long time since I've had any houseguests.<eos> And I've completely forgotten my manners.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Polite.<eos> Respectful.<eos> You young people remind me of home.<eos> My old home.
This need to hide in a simpler past... when the future cannot be avoided?<eos> It's coming.<eos> And when it does...<eos> Everything will change.<eos> If there are those who can stop it...<eos> Do we know how?<eos> It's happening faster than we thought.<eos> I don't think I can control it much longer.<eos> - It's coming.<eos> - René!
Uh, where the hell did he go?<eos> Well, it looks like Renautas is on the verge - of another major product line. - Nice.<eos> CEO Erica Kravid is rumored to make an announcement later this week. In anticipation of what insiders are calling "a revolutionary - new product line"--<eos> - Suspect is wearing a blue suit, horn-rimmed glasses, last seen in the vicinity of the urgent care waiting room.<eos> Let's keep it nice and quiet there...<eos> Norris.<eos> I'm the guy they're talking about on your walkie.<eos> Why?<eos> You put a guard in the hospital last year.<eos> This hospital.
The test results came back.<eos> And?<eos> You weren't a match.<eos> How could I not be?<eos> It's never a sure thing, even amongst family members.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> Well, the closest blood bank with her type is in south bend, Indiana.<eos> I can put in an order, but it could take up to six hours.<eos> Tommy, is there something you want to tell me?<eos> About what?
I spent the rest of that night hunched over a toilet.<eos> Why are you saying this now?<eos> We lost our son, joanne, and for the last year, I've been so terrified that I would lose you too, and the truth is I have lost you.<eos> I have lost myself.<eos> We have lost each other.<eos> If you want to do it, do it.<eos> I really did love you.<eos> You ever get the feeling you were meant to do something extraordinary?<eos> I work at an ice cream parlor in carbondale, Illinois.<eos> An extraordinary ice cream parlor.
I don't know.<eos> We got to find out, and there's one person who has the answers-- your mother.<eos> You've seen what she's capable of.<eos> We've got to stop her.<eos> I've got an idea.<eos> This way.<eos> All right.<eos> So why are we in St. Pierre?<eos> Just a stop along the way.<eos> Along the way to where exactly?

- Starting over is never pretty.<eos> - Previously on "Heroes Reborn"...
- I said that to her, Manny.<eos> - This is not your fault.<eos> You're damn right it's not my fault!<eos> Now fix it, or I'm not working for you anymore.<eos> - And how would you suggest that I...<eos> - Heal her.<eos> - Heal her.<eos> - I'm sorry, John.<eos> This is out of my hands.<eos> And yours.
Any word after the CAT scan?<eos> Aah! Bloody Jasper!<eos> Never makes things easy!<eos> I tried calling the hospital.<eos> But no one answered in her room.<eos> Reception didn't tell me squat.<eos> John!<eos> Talk to me.<eos> She has a brain tumor, Chas.<eos> Over the temporal lobe.
Of course they are.<eos> I must know that I can rely on you.<eos> Of course you can, Richard.<eos> On what year was your lordship first acquainted with Lady Worsley?<eos> We were introduced by Sir Richard Worsley in the year 1779.<eos> And you became an intimate of hers?<eos> Yes, I was a most intimate friend.<eos> You have had an intimacy of friendship.<eos> But have you had any particularly intimate connection with her?<eos> In the bedchamber.
This is a live feed from the precinct's interrogation room.<eos> My God.<eos> He walked in here, turned himself in.<eos> Seemingly no memory of how he got here, what happened to him after.<eos> You needed to hear this from me before word got out.<eos> To everyone else, the manhunt is over.<eos> To us, he's back from the dead.<eos> No one can ever know that.<eos> But, um... how is he...<eos> Okay...
Um, no.<eos> It's not even the right street corner, Alex.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sarah.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> In Philadelphia.
But now, finally, I'll be able to take the stand, be a part of the big show.<eos> No show. This is a serious legal proceeding, okay?<eos> And speaking to that, Ron LaFlamme has got us a new litigator and we are meeting him in an hour.<eos> How are we gonna pay this person?<eos> Our guy has agreed to waive his entire fee until our case is resolved.<eos> It's some wet-behind-the-ears noob straight out of law school.<eos> No, he is said to be very experienced, one of the best in the biz.<eos> Then why the fuck would he take our case on spec?<eos> Was I in possession of cocaine, amphetamines, amyl nitrate, also known as "poppers," at the time of my arrest?<eos> In large quantities.
I'll concede that the cultural moment may have passed, but at the time...<eos> No, at the time, it was as misogynistic as it is now, wasn't it, Mr. Bachman?<eos> -It... Yes, it had some major problems...<eos> -Some major problems?<eos> Mr. Bachman, a few moments ago, you said that it showed great promise.<eos> You said that.<eos> I can have the court reporter read it back to you, Mr. Bachman.<eos> I don't need her to read it back to me. I can remember...<eos> NipAlert was poorly conceived and riddled with bugs, wasn't it?<eos> Well, all apps in the beginning...
Jared, I saw your entire HR file. It was in the Hooli disclosure.<eos> You had a fat salary and stock options.<eos> By now, you would be a senior VP. But instead, you walked away to wrangle extension cords for a company that will be defunct in maybe 30 hours.<eos> If you're not kicking yourself even just a little bit, you are objectively insane.<eos> I can always find another job, but look at us... doing this.<eos> It's intoxicating.<eos> Don't act like it's not magical.<eos> It is.<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> Jesus Christ!
Mr. Bachman, I am sorry to drop in on you like this... - Erlich, Seriously! - But I have got the buyers here.<eos> Shit.<eos> He's gonna drink his own piss.<eos> - Gilfoyle, I need some fucking help!<eos> - Sorry, Louise, this isn't a great time.<eos> I'm entertaining... and I have some minor cosmetic repairs to do before I show the house.<eos> Oh, no, they don't even need to look inside.<eos> They only want the property for the lot value.<eos> - Seriously, I can't do this by myself!<eos> - Lot value? Meaning?
I did compete in high school athletics, yes.<eos> Yeah, maybe you could talk to him.<eos> Right? Like, relate to him on that level, get him to open up.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Good.<eos> So, you threw three interceptions.<eos> It happens.<eos> It was the worst game of my life.<eos> I threw five once.<eos> My senior year.
Well, y-you know how strict Zuransky was.<eos> I mean, he would suspend players or kick them off the team if they didn't keep their GPAs up.<eos> That's why we were losing.<eos> I-I just wanted to win.<eos> Fixing grades may not be moral, but I'm pretty sure it's not against the law.<eos> You know, it's nice that you rationalized all of this.<eos> But it doesn't change the fact that Zuransky still could have caught you doing it and that you needed to shut him up.<eos> Over what?<eos> An academic scandal?<eos> In high school?
I mean, until then, I just thought he was just out on one of his...<eos> Please stop lying.<eos> We have video of you at the train tracks.<eos> And you hated Coach Zuransky.<eos> He fired your son from his job.<eos> The one that kept him around football, the only thing that made him happy.<eos> Hey, football didn't make him happy; football made him crazy.<eos> Made him crazy?<eos> How?<eos> Back in high school,
But you're gonna have to forget a few things first.<eos> Either way, it's copper.<eos> You decide if it's a penny or a bullet.<eos> I saved your life in Tulsa the night that fire starter burned down the whole neighborhood.<eos> I was there with you when Gladys left you.<eos> I spent four years at your side...<eos> Noah, please, please.<eos> I spent four years at your side...<eos> Remember what happened in San Francisco?<eos> San Francisco?
Is that correct, Sergeant Gutierrez?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We retreated north of the building, where we were able to hold our ground.<eos> Due to a glitch in the footage, we can't make out what happened next.<eos> Lieutenant Nazan claims that you circled back through the east entry point and came up behind the rebels.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Two American soldiers died that day.<eos> Four survived.<eos> The question at hand is what part you played.<eos> Childbirth...
Not yet.<eos> You better have a damn good reason for bringing him here.<eos> Erica...<eos> Renautas found him.<eos> Impossible.<eos> We took every precaution.<eos> And I undid every one of them when I shot Erica Kravid.<eos> Lately I have been plagued with dreams...<eos> Fire raining down, blood everywhere, and the twins saving the world under a clock tower in Odessa, its hands stuck at 11:53.<eos> Odessa?
He's good.<eos> Can I get my money?<eos> Once the paperwork's done, you'll be out of here.<eos> No!<eos> Wow.<eos> At the convent, Sister Pat had a pickup truck, but it never did anything like this.<eos> You know, eating that crap is gonna rot your teeth.<eos> I'm making up for lost time. My grandmother never allowed candy, even on movie night.<eos> It sounds weird, but... it was the one time where I actually felt connected.<eos> Beyond the walls.
Well, that's just in the think tank stage right now.<eos> It could be interesting for someone of your concerns.<eos> I tell you what, the investor is on their way over here right now, and they're looking for someone to spearhead the project.<eos> _<eos> I know what's happening here.<eos> You climb the steps, ring the bell.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> She got out again.<eos> Found her living on the streets, hiding behind a dumpster like a dog.<eos> Oh, my God.
I told the ambassador we could leave in three days.<eos> You want to tell me what I just missed, here?<eos> ISIS is regrouping in Raqqa for a new offensive against the Syrian regime.<eos> I know.<eos> We talked about it.<eos> But it's not playing out the way anyone thought.<eos> There's a mass exodus of civilians underway.<eos> A refugee crisis is developing at the border.<eos> I want us to visit a camp there.<eos> In Lebanon.
Don't worry about our funding.<eos> I got assurances from Crocker,<eos> State Department's not gonna interfere.<eos> I'm not worried about the funding.<eos> I'm worried about Quinn.<eos> Two years in the shit, Dar.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> Shit.<eos> We've had a data breach.<eos> In Berlin.
When I'm alone<eos> What does not kill you makes a fighter<eos> Whoa! Watch the face!<eos> Footsteps even lighter Whoa, whoa.<eos> Come on, I mean, seriously.<eos> Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone Whoa!<eos> Here I am<eos> There you go.<eos> On my knees again<eos> On your knees again.
Wait!<eos> Bog!<eos> My son.<eos> Dawn!<eos> Dawn!<eos> You're all right.<eos> You're really all right.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Don't worry about a thing<eos> 'Cause every little thing

Yeah, I already have my guys on the lookout.<eos> No one matching Kai's description popped up overnight.<eos> What the hell is he doing?<eos> Bad news is, the employee kitchen didn't have a juicer.<eos> Good news is, they do now.<eos> -What is this?<eos> -It's a kale smoothie.<eos> It's good for DNA cell repair and for slowing cancer.<eos> Oh, are you warm enough?<eos> -I'm fine.

- Sid!<eos> - You're embarrassing yourself.<eos> I mean, it just feels like you're rushing it.<eos> If you took the time to think about it...<eos> You smell.<eos> Really bad.<eos> Princess, I'm a knight of the seven realms about to ride into a battle so epic...<eos> Oh, God, yeah. Yeah, we should find a place.<eos> I need to wash up.<eos> Oh. Good.
Well, it's been a pleasure.<eos> You really don't have to thank me for anything.<eos> You actually have a lot of nice qualities...<eos> All on your own.<eos> Careful, princess.<eos> You're getting dangerously close to paying me a compliment.<eos> I can do compliments.<eos> I mean, you know your way around a horse, you're not so bad with a sword, and your beard magically stays the same length all the time.<eos> And... you have an ability to see the best in people even after they've wronged you.<eos> Like with Madalena.
Go.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Why am I like this?<eos> Why do I continually allow people to treat me this way?<eos> - Sire! - Hmm?<eos> I-I think I know something that may help you.<eos> Really?<eos> What?<eos> Have you ever heard of Xanax?<eos> Xanax?

Emma Wilson's journal.<eos> I took it from her apartment.<eos> "It's all about 19."<eos> Chapter 19... "Tell the Israelites to bring a red heifer."<eos> Heifer?<eos> It's a cow.<eos> _<eos> These guys are dangerous.<eos> But his sojourn into the desert made him impure.<eos> Oh, my God.
These numbers lead us to...<eos> Psalm 17:8.<eos> The Prayer of David.<eos> "Keep me as the apple of your eye, hide me under the shadow of your wings."<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> I mean, David wanted to hide in God's eye.<eos> How does that help us?<eos> The Prayer of David is depicted in three mosaics across the world...<eos> Rome, Istanbul, and Israel.<eos> Where in Israel?
- Beg for forgiveness!<eos> You're the ones who need to be forgiven, not me.<eos> You need to repent your sins.<eos> Or God will strike you down.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ It's a mosaic, just like this.<eos> - Oh, up there...<eos> Roman bathhouse.
You and Pearl were close, weren't you?<eos> We were friends.<eos> Sid said he had nothing against her type.<eos> Now, what would he mean by that?<eos> ~ You took her beads.<eos> ~ Yes, I did.<eos> They were covered in her blood.<eos> I'm sentimental.<eos> You were intimate friends, weren't you?<eos> In a Sapphic sense.
Albert has telephoned.<eos> He said that... that the caviar has arrived.<eos> Thank you, Mr B.<eos> So if the 'caviar' is who I think it is, where is it being sent to?<eos> Tasmania?<eos> So what do I tell my chief?<eos> You can tell him that the Air Force doesn't know either.<eos> That's some consolation.<eos> Even though Compton saved my life.<eos> ~ Literally?
It is now possible to restore Mr Woods' dignity and his life with the latest surgical techniques.<eos> We hope that the Ladies Auxiliary will see the enormous benefit in continuing to fund our war victims' program.<eos> Next, we have Lady Granville with her alternative proposal for the Henry Granville...<eos> Help!<eos> Somebody, help! Come quickly, I found a child!<eos> I found a dead child.<eos> MAN: Excuse me.<eos> Ned never come home since the night before last.<eos> Where is home, Paddy?<eos> Collingwood.
Not officially.<eos> No, I've been a volunteer's aide since the war.<eos> Let me tell you, if I didn't give them a feed every now and then they'd never let me near them.<eos> When was the last time you saw either of the boys?<eos> Ah, I'd have to check my book.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Badger was doing so well too.<eos> Just got a clean bill of health from the hospital on his pneumonia.<eos> Paddy, you said your things were here.<eos> Yeah, back in the stables.
This has nothing to do with the Inspector!<eos> I just told you I'm busy, alright?<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> Yes?<eos> I'd like to hand in my resignation from the police force.<eos> (Gasps) I heard you caught the real killer.<eos> I'm not angry with you anymore.<eos> I'm glad to hear I've been forgiven.<eos> Can I have a go at your gun?<eos> Not on your nelly!
Eat with them, drink with them.<eos> Everyone will be questioned, Guido.<eos> Vincenzo, you too.<eos> To the station.<eos> Everybody, it's nothing.<eos> That pazzo tries to shoot me.<eos> And I'm the criminal?<eos> The Carbones are being dealt with.<eos> But Guido should be charged.<eos> And not just for this.
Miss, is everything alright?<eos> Yes, Dot.<eos> I think everything's starting to make sense.<eos> Miss.<eos> Marianna.<eos> How are things between you and Vincenzo?<eos> I couldn't help noticing at the funeral you slapped him.<eos> It was nothing.<eos> It was a misunderstanding.<eos> About?
Most likely bearing scorch marks.<eos> Should I begin to question our suspect, sir?<eos> Miss Fisher will assist me with that, Constable.<eos> My shorthand is not quite as impressive, but I have other qualities.<eos> You heard Miss Fisher, Constable.<eos> Have you come to shut us down? No.<eos> No, I'm with Miss Fisher, Mrs Stanley's niece.<eos> Oh. Poor Mrs Stanley.<eos> Did you know that her son died?<eos> In his sleep.
The whole establishment made a lasting impression.<eos> Mr Freud would be terribly interested in that.<eos> I'm quite interested myself.<eos> So, what exactly are we looking for, sir?<eos> We'll discuss that later, Constable.<eos> It would certainly explain the conspiracy of silence.<eos> So, who is the current head of the medical association?<eos> Dr Wilbur Littleton.<eos> Hayden Samuels was a former colleague of mine, but he was asked to leave our medical rooms when he was called before the board some three weeks ago to answer questions in relation to malpractice.<eos> On what grounds?
He prefers to run the practice solely on donations.<eos> The women who can afford to give more support the women who have less.<eos> Except, luckily, most of Dr Samuels' patients are extremely wealthy.<eos> Well, he's been in private practice in Collins Street.<eos> Of course only a certain calibre of patient will visit him.<eos> Who encourages the patients to donate such... large amounts?<eos> No-one.<eos> They do it to show their appreciation.<eos> And where is all this money held?<eos> At the bank, of course.

BOTH:<eos> Angela Lombard.<eos> She never misses an opportunity to put Constance off her game.<eos> Angela's been world champion for several years now, but when you're up that high, the only way is down.<eos> With Constance nipping at her heels?<eos> Yes, and last I heard, world champions don't take kindly to that sort of thing.<eos> This is the SY Ena.<eos> Isn't she glorious?<eos> Angela's a keen sailor, so I've arranged to have her stay on board while she's here for my tennis tournament.<eos> ~ Your tournament?
So, it was more likely a practical joke.<eos> Well, I fail to see the humour.<eos> And the motive remains the same - to scare me off the case.<eos> And to frame Terence Lawson at the same time.<eos> Do you think you can get rid of that now?<eos> It's important evidence, Miss Fisher.<eos> So is this, but you're not seeing it until that disappears.<eos> That wasn't so difficult, now, was it?<eos> ~ An endorsement contract.<eos> ~ Potentially.
It's all still there.<eos> £50,000.<eos> That's quite a sum, Mr Wren.<eos> Was it funded from your family bequest?<eos> There is no family, I'm afraid.<eos> I lost my wife, Agnes, many years ago, and I don't hail from wealth but a number of my inventions did very well after I won science awards myself, as a youth.<eos> With that amount of money, the competition must've been fierce.<eos> Did Tode know he was going to win?<eos> He was informed several months ago so he could book his passage from London.<eos> On the Blue Star.
Hugh and I are joyful enough.<eos> Just our priest who wants to spoil things.<eos> Oh, and Hugh's mother and my mother and probably most of our relatives.<eos> Any chance of a refill for the rear guard dog?<eos> It's just brewing.<eos> Pardon me for asking, Baron, but any idea what this bloke's after, apart from your head on a platter?<eos> Not 100% sure, Albert, but I think a great deal of money would at least keep him at bay.<eos> Seasickness pills, headache, cough tincture, eye drops.<eos> Quentin Tode was clearly a man obsessed by his health.<eos> And scientific research.
Please, Mae, don't.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> My hands are too soaped up right now to stop you, But I really want you to hear me when I say I want you to stop.<eos> No, you don't want me to stop.<eos> You're embarrassing yourself!<eos> I want to do it properly, at my birthday.<eos> I want to stand up and announce it.<eos> I have nothing to be afraid of.<eos> No.<eos> Not at your birthday, not with me there.
What if it gives me an erection?<eos> (Scoffs) It won't!<eos> Not really our problem, is it?<eos> You got your little quote?<eos> A ship in the harbour is safe, but that's not what ships are built for.<eos> Oh, God, Arnold...<eos> Um, hey, they're nice shoes.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Where'd you get them?<eos> Um, a store.

yes!<eos> -And, uh, we looked all through your room And you asked me if I had it, And I said I definitely did not have your passport?<eos> -And then you had to go to an embassy in bangkok<eos> And wait for three hours-- -yes, I remember!<eos> -Let me finish.<eos> Let me finish.<eos> While you also had diarrhea. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I found it.<eos> It was in my pa--<eos> -In my passport wallet.
-Okay? That's it then, is it? Okay.<eos> Nice knowing you. Is there something wrong with you, rose?<eos> There's something wrong with your head.<eos> -Yeah, there is.<eos> That's how you guys met.<eos> -Why can't you see that I'm a good man?<eos> -What do you think we should do?<eos> -He'll wear himself out.<eos> -I'm seconds away from blowing my top here.<eos> Seconds away!
Picking his nose, his nostrils would Get huge and then everybody would know that he picked his nose?<eos> And I can't believe it's true. -He went white.<eos> -Whiter than that?<eos> -Okay.<eos> All right. -I don't think you can get whiter.<eos> -Yeah, you know what?<eos> I'm happy.<eos> I'm happy to sacrifice myself so we can all bond.<eos> -Whiter than going to the farmers' market?<eos> Whiter than binge drinking, huh?
-Please can we not mention it?<eos> oh, shit!<eos> John, buddy, what have you eaten? -Oh-- oh-- it's-- it's okay.<eos> I'll-<eos> - I'll get it.<eos> -Hey, hey, hey, hey, you all right?<eos> -She sounds very distressed.<eos> What if something is wrong?<eos> -Do you want a holiday house on the beach or in the country?<eos> -Um, beach.
A few weeks later this guy, his name is ben, he calls me and he says,<eos> "I'm getting an operation on my shit brain and I might die. Please come and see me."<eos> At first, I was a bit confused at why he'd ask me, But then I remembered what a weird freak boy he was, and it made a lot of sense, And he has no one in his life to call except me,<eos> The other weird guy from the internet who briefly touched his penis once. -Okay.<eos> Are you done?<eos> -This morning I went to the hospital, right, because I am a nice guy,<eos> When I go visit someone to say hi a few hours before they maybe die in surgery.<eos> -Okay.<eos> You like him?<eos> -Yes, but not romantically.
It makes them come to their senses.<eos> That's precisely why I feared it might never happen.<eos> I'd like to see St. Clair's face when he learns that I outrank him onceagain andrightlyso .<eos> Doctor, will you excuse us?<eos> The promotion is in title only.<eos> ( sighs ) You remain subordinate to those promoted in February.<eos> You mean to tell me that the man who defeated Burgoyne is outranked by the men who retreated from him?<eos> Stephen, St. Clair, Mifflin, Lincoln--<eos> I've won more battles than all of them put together.<eos> Title only.
How dare you invade my privacy?<eos> - I- - I'm sorry.<eos> - Answer me!<eos> I--<eos> I saw you and Abraham talking the other night.<eos> The two of you talking in secret on his return from the city and then pretending like you'd just seen each other the next morning.<eos> I was concerned that I was being excluded and alarmed to find I couldn't imagine why.<eos> Oh, Richard, Richard.<eos> This kind of confusion is exactly why I wanted to tell you about our plan, - but Abraham begged me not to.<eos> - What plan?
He's deeply ashamed of his association and he did not want to disappoint you or worry you.<eos> He's right, I would worry.<eos> Which would put undue pressure on him at a time which, I'm sure you'll agree, he needs all his wits about him.<eos> I can see that you are right.<eos> And despite my conduct here, I would ask a favor of you.<eos> What?<eos> Don't tell him that I know.<eos> Of course.<eos> Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?<eos> - In his tail. - ( feminine voice ) In his tongue.
So, how many of these second-decompression surgeries have you done so far?<eos> - Uh, one.<eos> - One.<eos> And do you think the patient will see progress?<eos> Well, if anyone will, it's her, yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Paulette.<eos> Imaging looks good.<eos> How's the head?<eos> Totally fine.
They will never catch it. I'm 100% sure of that.<eos> Yo, we're buying loyalty with hookers and blow?<eos> That's not Empire.<eos> Now, this is the music business, and it may take hookers and blow to try and reclaim some of the artists that took off after you went prancing about with your little freak flag.<eos> You're right about one thing. Sexual proclivity is what put us in this position.<eos> Your proclivity, and the fact that you can't manage to simply keep it in your pants.<eos> And if the creeps and the bigots want to be over at Creedmoor, I don't give a damn, let them.<eos> I don't want them at my company, and neither should you.<eos> - Dad, Travie.<eos> Your company?
Previously on "Secrets And Lies"...<eos> You're a murder suspect, Ben.<eos> How do you think that's gonna look to a family-court judge?<eos> You're really gonna use our kids to get your revenge?<eos> That $25,000 that paid for my retainer came straight from the missus.<eos> Your wife is hiding cash.<eos> Dave and I retraced our steps.<eos> It all came back when I saw Tom's trike in the driveway.<eos> I wanted to warn Jess.<eos> - About what?

You don't have to do that.<eos> You want to talk or...?<eos> Forget it.<eos> I'm sorr...<eos> No.<eos> I'd love some company.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Last night was insane.<eos> Good or bad?<eos> Great.
That's not the issue.<eos> H-her being crazy is the issue.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No. Wait.<eos> Um, who's the crazy one, Ben?<eos> She is.<eos> Seriously.<eos> She needs medication.<eos> I saw a picture of her wearing the blue jacket.<eos> The blue jacket?
The video's the problem.<eos> What video?<eos> Cornell showed it to me last night.<eos> It's from the taxi.<eos> You see me get out and walk directly to Jess' house.<eos> God, no.<eos> I was drunk. I was drugged.<eos> And I was violent, and I didn't go home.<eos> I could have done anything that night.<eos> No way. No way. No way, man!
When I put my hand in the pocket, that's when I found the tooth, and...<eos> It all came back.<eos> You have my undivided attention, Mr. Crawford.<eos> I took a taxi home alone from the bar.<eos> Here you go, man.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's when I saw Tom's trike in the driveway.<eos> The TV was on, so I knew Jess was awake, and I wanted to warn her.<eos> Warn her?<eos> About what?

A gambler on the run is still a gambler.<eos> We are who we are.<eos> So you're still the same jerk you were when you were 10?<eos> I worshipped you, and you weren't very nice to me.<eos> Well, I was a different person back then.<eos> I mean, I was 10 years old, right?<eos> So I guess... I guess I...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> He's here.<eos> Leather jacket.
- Are you the father?<eos> - Uh, yes...<eos> - Cell phones aren't allowed.<eos> - My whole life's in that.<eos> Your whole life is over there, waiting for you.<eos> Your job is to be here so your kids find their way back to you, okay?<eos> Mr. Klina, it's great you're here.<eos> Your kids are so happy.<eos> The raft is going to be great, and when we're on the water...<eos> Ship ahoy.
That's what art is about, contrast, photography.<eos> No, it's not. Not when you're getting married.<eos> Yes, you have the beauty of a wedding...<eos> Mom...<eos> Mom!<eos> - Mom, mom!<eos> - What, what?<eos> I think I'm having a contraction.<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, my... oh.
You know, we've heard about this view for so many years, and we've never gotten up here.<eos> Yeah, okay, we'll...<eos> we'll see it all, Millie.<eos> - We'll see it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, we will.<eos> Just a second.<eos> I just need a breather here.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Oh, God.
- Mm. - That would be stupid.<eos> - You okay? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I've just been thinking.<eos> I don't want you to be disappointed, but I really just want to get married here.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I'm not gonna be disappointed.<eos> We can get married around here.<eos> You know the... in the Napa valley area, there's some good landscapes there that, you know, at the golden hour... but, Hank, you know, I feel like<eos> I really want to do it here in San Francisco and soon.<eos> Like, next week.

And we officially have nothing left to lose, so...<eos> You got that right.<eos> I can feel the mojo coming back right now just looking at this.<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't think you need to do that anymore.<eos> - I think that looks good. - Hey.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can we talk about the thing?<eos> What? What thing?
You got that right.<eos> I can feel the mojo coming back right now just looking at this.<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't think you need to do that anymore.<eos> - I think that looks good. - Hey.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can we talk about the thing?<eos> What? What thing?<eos> The giant tomato in the room?
What is all this stuff?<eos> This, Grandson, is what 72 years of memories looks like.<eos> Right, so what are we looking for?<eos> We are looking for a baseball in a shoe box.<eos> Baseball...<eos> Well, there's shoe boxes everywhere,<eos> - but I can... - Yeah.<eos> Oh, boy, we got our...<eos> We got our work cut out for us, don't we?<eos> Oh, God.
Yeah?<eos> That's the year I got my first big photo published.<eos> I was in Sri Lanka.<eos> I was covering this... an unrelated story, and then a terrorist bombs a bus depot.<eos> Lucky.<eos> Oh, I remember that clearly.<eos> I was so excited to get that shot.<eos> It was like, uh...<eos> It was like my whole world depended on it.<eos> Oh, boy, man.
- Great job. - Oh!<eos> [cell phone rings] Excuse me.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Uh, I just wanted to say hi.<eos> [chuckles] Hi.<eos> And what is that awesome music you're listening to?<eos> I am at the skating rink with the kids.<eos> How they doing?<eos> Well, better than the last lap.
I don't got a ton of friends.<eos> Any.<eos> I don't got any.<eos> I don't know what it is exactly but I'm working on that.<eos> You, uh, you know, we're not that close but we got to know each other and... and... and I like you, you know?<eos> You don't say much and when you do you talk very low and then... then... and... and I kind of like that.<eos> Thank you, Hank.<eos> Um, I mean we kind of identify with each other and I was just wondering, wanna be my best man at this thing?<eos> Yeah... at the wedding?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, at the wedding.
- But we're gonna make it work.<eos> And I'm gonna be the new Adam.<eos> And I want you...<eos> I want to know.<eos> Are you up to being the new Crosby?<eos> - You're not serious.<eos> - I'm dead serious.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - I'm dead serious!<eos> - Oh, my God!
Yep.<eos> It's, uh, you know, it's pretty, uh, crazy that we, uh, met on the train.<eos> Yeah, y-y-yeah.<eos> It's so...<eos> It's so crazy. Yeah.<eos> Um...<eos> But, you know, not, like, crazy bad.<eos> No, it-it's definitely good crazy. It's definitely...<eos> Oh, y-y-yeah.<eos> Like something from a romantic comedy.
- I'll do it.<eos> And you'll tell everybody - at water polo?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They can find another... male.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And please don't write about this.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - On the blog, okay.
Let me do it, let me do it.<eos> Girls, girls, there were some fairy princesses inside, and they made you some bubble water!<eos> Yay!<eos> Bubble water! But I go first.<eos> That's exactly right.<eos> Me second! Me second!<eos> Thank you.<eos> - There we are.<eos> - Sarah's is the one with the treasure chest.<eos> - Our husbands.
It's nice to meet you.<eos> Josh has told me so much about you.<eos> Okay.<eos> So it says here you two have been together for three months.<eos> Um, no, no, it's, uh, three weeks, actually.<eos> - Three weeks?<eos> - Mm-hmm. There's an Activia in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with.<eos> So, Mom, uh, Rachel, uh, works for a nonprofit.<eos> Oh.<eos> - A nonprofit.
Because his followers named him rabbi, Joseph, doesn't mean he was one.<eos> The Nazarene gave succor to those would take up arms against Rome.<eos> Which would have been a disaster, prompting Rome to unleash reinforcements that would turn the Mediterranean red with Jewish blood.<eos> I don't agree he posed the threat you believe.<eos> Which is why you will never become the high priest.<eos> The Jewish people have survived the tyranny of many empires with pragmatism and compromise.<eos> With careful helmsmanship, it will outlast the Roman occupation.<eos> Not by asking Rome to crucify Jews, it won't.<eos> May I ask where the Nazarene was buried?<eos> In my tomb.
Yet another example of the advantages of living under Rome's influence.<eos> Along with the improved ports, trading routes, shipping, laws, music, poetry.<eos> We like to think that our cultural interaction goes both ways.<eos> This festival of Pentecost, which we are currently celebrating, commemorates our link back to the laws of Moses, and yet enhances our role in the modern world.<eos> A role that, thanks to Roman tolerance, you're free to express.<eos> To a degree.<eos> I am warden and guardian of the temple, and as such, I feel I have a small request to make.<eos> Go on.<eos> Roman soldiers around the temple this time of year do not help to make the people feel your tolerance.<eos> Quite the opposite, in fact.
You did that just now?<eos> Yep.<eos> She's quite pissed off.<eos> How old are you again?<eos> I'm nearly 30.<eos> I know. Um...<eos> I... I worry.<eos> I worry a lot.<eos> I'm quite weird.<eos> Anyway, yeah, um...
- I broke my ankle last year.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah. I slightly misjudged the, er... the jump.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You twat.<eos> One for the road?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, um, how do you get home from here?<eos> Oh, just... bus.
He had both of our hearts.<eos> As big a bastard as he was, he did love you.<eos> [ voice breaks ] And, uh, now he's gone from our lives forever.<eos> Yeah, I... [ inhales deeply ] I just, I uh... I just hope he's found whatever it is he's looking for.<eos> That means it's ready.<eos> Yes, I know how to work a microwave, thank you.<eos> Because the Dark One did so much cooking in his time.<eos> Well, worry not.<eos> My power extends far beyond Ramen noodles.<eos> Yeah, just not in this life.
Yeah, no, totally, I get that.<eos> I can keep it on the dillzies for realzies.<eos> Greatzies.<eos> Well, I'm going to let you get back to doing...<eos> Hello, my child.<eos> Look who's out of her PJ's and all dressed up like Mariska Hargitay.<eos> I have a hot date tonight.<eos> Oh, yeah, you got a date?<eos> Is he gonna pick you up on a Citi Bike?<eos> Huh? Piggyback?

You trying to turn this into some kind of sex competition?<eos> Yep, and I'm gonna win, 'cause I am a woman, and I know what feels good down there, and I am going to arrive to down there<eos> Bam!<eos> Boom!<eos> It's boom.<eos> Emergency.<eos> Help. - What?<eos> - I committed to having lesbian sex soon, very soon, so I need some tutoring.<eos> I have to give April the best orgasm she's ever had in her life or at least better than Stosh can.<eos> Of her life.
Bad move.<eos> I gave her money, and she blew our date off.<eos> Changed her chat handle.<eos> I complained to the admin, but they didn't help.<eos> So I scoured the site. Found her new profile name and picture.<eos> Kept up on her next date. And confronted her in person.<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> So, you're on a lot of these sites?<eos> These dating sites, sugar sites?<eos> All kinds.
If anything, it gives us the right to be creepier because we know it's not going anywhere.<eos> Yeah, it's... it's just fantasies.<eos> Well, I'm single...<eos> I still have a shot.<eos> (scoffs) See?<eos> Fantasies.<eos> (laughs) Can we talk about something other than women, please?<eos> Sports, politics, religion...<eos> anything at all.<eos> The weather.
Technically, nothing.<eos> It was, it was done to me, but I should've never been there to let it happen.<eos> Okay, what's the "i"" that we're talking about?<eos> A kiss by a girl.<eos> Wait, you kissed someone?<eos> No, no, no, she kissed me.<eos> Who kissed you?<eos> A girl at work.<eos> Where?<eos> At the bar.

It's messed up in there.<eos> Girl's busting on each other like dudes.<eos> Is Becka still in, or... ?<eos> Nah, they got her in some drug rehab last I heard.<eos> But Gabi's back in.<eos> She is?<eos> She said she's seen Kiara.<eos> - Where?<eos> - South East.<eos> On El Cajon.
Maybe you could sell it for enough to go on the tour.<eos> Yeah, well, my other mom would probably kill me and I don't know, it kinda feels disrespectful, I guess, to my grandfather.<eos> It's not like he'll ever know.<eos> Unless you think he's looking down on you from heaven?<eos> Well, I don't know about heaven, but I think they can maybe see us.<eos> So, do you think he's watching us now?<eos> I sort of hope not.<eos> And talk about a buzz kill.<eos> We could do this every day.<eos> On tour.
- And...<eos> - I know!<eos> Don't you think he'd want me to use it for something I really am into?<eos> You know, something I really want?<eos> That was not an email, that was an act of oppression.<eos> All we want is the chance to be heard.<eos> And how is it you saw this act of oppression with no access to the Internet?<eos> We got online using Mr. Nesbit's Wi-Fi.<eos> You can pick it up in certain areas of the house.<eos> - Like the front porch.
And you guys can pretend like you're camping.<eos> So now that Connor's dad assumes that Jude is straight, it's suddenly OK for his son to spend the night?<eos> I didn't know what to say.<eos> He was in a bind and I was on the spot.<eos> It's not that Connor isn't welcome...<eos> I just can't fight another battle today.<eos> - You think Jude's OK with it?<eos> - Nah...<eos> - They have been hanging out a lot more.<eos> - Yeah, in groups.
[low-tempo pop song plays] [Connor] Hey, um, I texted Daria back and I told her I'm just gonna stay here.<eos> It's not nice to lead people on.<eos> OK, well, I'm not.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - [groans] - Are you OK?<eos> I didn't... I didn't mean to kick you that hard.<eos> Why'd you kick me at all?<eos> You kissed me, remember?<eos> In the tent?
By the way, Jesus wants us to reschedule the meeting with the Flintwood scout.<eos> I thought he wasn't ready to leave home?<eos> Apparently, Mariana thinks it would be good a good idea.<eos> You know, Monte went to boarding school.<eos> Oh, did she? Didn't know that.<eos> She said it saved her life.<eos> Hmm. Had a troubled youth, did she?<eos> She said it was the only reason she got into a good college.<eos> - [in snooty accent] She probably went to Harvard.<eos> - Princeton, actually.
All right.<eos> Keep me posted.<eos> When we collected the devices from Zoey's room, someone was watching us through the camera on her laptop.<eos> Zoey's laptop is infected with a malware that allows the device to connect with and control it. A backdoor Trojan.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And I found a foreign I.P. address in her network logs.<eos> We're running it down now.<eos> We may not know who, but I think I know why she was being spied on.<eos> I made a cluster graph of the social media response to Zoey's disappearance.<eos> On multiple platforms.
Yeah, well, it sounds like Emily didn't have much choice, if what she's saying is true.<eos> If what she's saying is true?<eos> Come on.<eos> Between you and me, she was a little shaky with her facts in there.<eos> You try getting the crap kicked out of you and having to off your ex.<eos> We'll see how shaky you are.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> It's just... I've seen Emily play people, including me.<eos> She's good at it.<eos> Anyway...
She swore up and down that Daniel wasn't angry or violent or anything.<eos> You know, in fact, according to her, he was as happy as she'd ever seen him.<eos> He was excited that he was gonna be a father.<eos> I'm sorry, did you just say...<eos> A father?<eos> Yeah, you didn't know?<eos> I'm sorry. I think I'm gonna need a break.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Uh, would you mind if I asked you just one more question?<eos> What?
The damage that I caused was real, and I knew it at the time.<eos> I wouldn't hurt him because... Underneath all of the scar tissue and... The flaws, the temper there was a genuinely good guy just trying to find his way.<eos> So, despite our history, despite everything that I told myself I cared about him.<eos> But you still shot him.<eos> Only when I knew I didn't have a choice.<eos> Only when I knew he intended to kill me.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> Because he tried it before...<eos> - The night of our wedding.<eos> - On the boat.
Long gone.<eos> I get it, but you don't understand.<eos> If this gets back to him, Dante will kill me.<eos> Then you better hope I find him first.<eos> You hear from Dante, I'm your first call.<eos> This isn't just about drugs or the bombing.<eos> He's trying to make alliances with gangs, branch out into weapons.<eos> Dante, he wants to put the Syndicate back together.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Not in my city.
Everybody keep your heads.<eos> Just keep up.<eos> So, is he okay with it?<eos> It was pretty much his idea.<eos> He gets it.<eos> It's got a bed and a bath, but it's still a cage, you know?<eos> He gets it.<eos> He told me what happened out there with the trucks.<eos> He tell you about those guys he met?<eos> The Ws.
We're not bringing anyone else into this.<eos> It's just you and me again, Mr. Reese.<eos> I don't care if I have bad reception, Terrence.<eos> We're rolling calls.<eos> Now get me on with Anton.<eos> We better be out of here by Friday night, you know.<eos> I got courtside Knicks tickets.<eos> Grading exams.<eos> Where do you teach?<eos> Oh, at a local college.
If Emma's there to kill anybody, she must be planning on using her bare hands.<eos> I couldn't find any evidence that she was trying to buy a weapon.<eos> Perhaps her plan involves a method of attack you haven't considered.<eos> I know a lot of ways to kill people, Harold.<eos> She just pulled out a second phone.<eos> _<eos> Are you seeing this, Mr. Reese?<eos> Maybe I couldn't find out Emma's plan because she's working with a partner.<eos> Here's lunch.<eos> Oh, good.
I keep it like in the repression folder, you know?<eos> If it happened to me, you have my permission to look away.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I'm gonna see you give birth then?<eos> Bitch, dur, dur, dur, dur, dur.<eos> Who else would be my focal point?<eos> Also, I wanna do it in one of those birthing pools, and I feel like my apartment is just... it's dirty, and there's a lot of traffic around it.<eos> I thought maybe I could do it here.<eos> In the living room.
Hey.<eos> Are you ok? Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything's tickety boo.<eos> Totally disco.<eos> Thank you, guv.<eos> You've been with Luther?<eos> We have, yes.<eos> And did he know?<eos> About Alice Morgan?
It's all over.<eos> Would you just calm down?<eos> It's not over.<eos> According to Anna, if we get Hewlett back to Setauket, he can release Abe from prison, right?<eos> And then we're back in business.<eos> So where is Major Hewlett?<eos> Our defender of Long Island?<eos> Being held at an outpost near New Haven.<eos> He's been found guilty of wartime atrocities.<eos> - Atrocities?
To know that you could shoot any one of them.<eos> With my consent, of course.<eos> Hey there, big man.<eos> You a soldier now?<eos> I'm a Queen's Ranger.<eos> Special kind of soldier.<eos> So how's that fine-looking mama of yours?<eos> Now that I'm back, I'm hoping to swing by, see her one day in York City.<eos> She in Philadelphia now.<eos> Philadelphia?
What caused your change of heart?<eos> Why, you, of course.<eos> Your overture reminded me why I fight.<eos> Not for personal gain, but because I have a duty to uphold to my fellow officers and to the women who love them.<eos> My only satisfaction will be in slaying our enemies and meriting your esteem.<eos> Killing two birds with one stone, as it were.<eos> I... I don't know what to say.<eos> How can I thank you?<eos> Well, given the dangers we face and the possibility that I may not return, there's one favor I'll be bold enough to request.<eos> A kiss.
You had the wrong man, I have the right one.<eos> Does my nose deceive me, or have you laid hands on some nutmeg concoction?<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Your phone.<eos> There's an application on it which allows me to track you.<eos> So you saw that I hadn't gone back to London.<eos> I knew you weren't going the second you told me.<eos> If you knew that I was lying...<eos> You were right the other day.<eos> At the morgue.
You, um... saved me.<eos> I'd like to return the favor.<eos> This is a favor.<eos> Interfering.<eos> If you decide that killing Gruner is going to make you feel whole again, I won't stop you.<eos> But I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you that we had found a way to expose him.<eos> What does that have to do with me?<eos> With what he did to me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Everything.
Got something here.<eos> Looks like a piece of wet suit.<eos> Doesn't match either of our victims.<eos> Could be Anna's.<eos> She struggles with the thieves, maybe slips or pushed overboard.<eos> It's unlikely she would have been taken hostage if we have two victims.<eos> Maybe she jumped to get away from the thieves.<eos> She's out there treading water somewhere.<eos> Muscle fatigue and hypothermia, worst-case scenario, Anna could survive probably eight hours in the Gulf.<eos> And the best?
Don't let Jeremy hate me.<eos> Make sure he has his Lamby".<eos> Lamby?<eos> A stuffed animal.<eos> Jeremy sleeps with it.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Where's my daughter?<eos> Sir, I have my people running a trace.<eos> And we're still searching for her, but based on these texts and the lack of cell reception at sea, I mean, we got to guess that she's on land.<eos> And on the run.
Thermal contraction caused by temperature differential.<eos> - It's normal.<eos> - Right. It's normal, Daph.<eos> It didn't sound normal.<eos> It sounded like there's something outside.<eos> Something outside?<eos> You mean, in the vacuum of space?<eos> Like what? Yeah.<eos> Like what?<eos> In the vacuum of space?
See?<eos> Machines are useful.<eos> Machines are...<eos> Jinkies.<eos> You really don't like robots, do you?<eos> I guess you don't take to progress very well.<eos> Progress?<eos> You mean the sort of progress that put automated machines in the car factories?<eos> The sort of progress that put my father... and hundreds of others like him out of work when I was a kid?<eos> That sort of progress?
That sort of progress?<eos> Bay. If he had his way, we wouldn't have planes... let alone the technology to fly to the moon.<eos> Maybe U-Boat's right.<eos> Maybe that alien was only in our heads.<eos> Yeah, just like that alien.<eos> Yep, that alien's not really there.<eos> Neither is that one.<eos> Or that one.<eos> Like, we last him, I think we're okay, Scoob.<eos> Yeah. More than okay.
It creates a pressure-sensitive electromagnetic field for attraction.<eos> I think you might know a thing or two about electromagnetic attraction.<eos> - Am I right?<eos> - Yau can't be serious.<eos> I think I may throw up.<eos> Really? Are you serious?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - And repulsion.<eos> - That's more accurate, I'd say.<eos> - Very handy in space.
Exactly.<eos> That plus melting... suggests it was a meteor.<eos> Yeah, but... doesn't the location of Trinity feel, like, a little too convenient, no?<eos> Like what, you think it was aimed like a weapon?<eos> I mean, it's either another weapons test, or someone is trying to make a point.<eos> Yeah, but we traced the trajectory-- it didn't come from Earth.<eos> Look, this is something that somebody didn't want us to know about.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> This is a special broadcast.<eos> 4:10 P.M. today, on live television,
You should be ordering me to clear Ma'an street by street instead of tying my hands.<eos> Ahmed, did you hear me tell my uncle not to retaliate?<eos> No.<eos> All I said was respond proportionately.<eos> Avoid civilian targets.<eos> There are no civilian targets in Ma'an.<eos> Not as long as they keep giving sanctuary to Rashid.<eos> Colonel Mahmoud, how much of Ma'an is still actively supporting the insurgency?<eos> Well, our most recent intelligence, uh, estimate is running at ten percent.<eos> And last month?
He needs to develop that relationship.<eos> And I'll put Nusrat next to the wife of the Minister of Culture.<eos> It's good she's managed to move past the unpleasant business with her father and take her place in the family.<eos> She's a pragmatic woman.<eos> Colonel Mahmoud found the target.<eos> I need your approval.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I hab's weapons depot, above a dress shop.<eos> That sounds promising.<eos> Proportionate, anyway.
Killing insurgents?<eos> Convincing the same tribes we've been killing for generations that we don't hate them anymore because we're building an oil refinery in Ma'an?<eos> Where is this coming from?<eos> From him.<eos> Our child.<eos> I mean, what if we have a boy?<eos> Maybe another year or two, we have another son.<eos> What if one tries to overthrow the other?<eos> This is about your uncle.<eos> My uncle, your father, Ihab Rashid.
And look at us!<eos> We're turning on each other.<eos> You can kill me, but whoever betrayed you will still be out there.<eos> Muss...<eos> I believe you.<eos> I know that you are no traitor.<eos> You don't have... don't have the balls to be a traitor.<eos> Go to Belrut.<eos> Go.<eos> To Belrut.
- Why would a person just show someone their butthole?<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> A real bronze medal.<eos> - Oh! - Why would you think I meant a butthole?<eos> Well, you said "bronze medal."<eos> I mean, it is the third best hole.<eos> Brownish.<eos> So, you're feeling, um...<eos> Human.
What?<eos> No!<eos> A real bronze medal.<eos> - Oh! - Why would you think I meant a butthole?<eos> Well, you said "bronze medal."<eos> I mean, it is the third best hole.<eos> Brownish.<eos> So, you're feeling, um...<eos> Human.<eos> - A little human. - Huh.
Pretty Lake's not so bad.<eos> Still having a hard time getting used to living in a small town.<eos> Here.<eos> Got you something.<eos> - What's this for?<eos> - You're a smart guy.<eos> Thought you might wanna expand your horizons when you get bored of the regular curriculum.<eos> I started my master's on it.<eos> It's pretty good.<eos> - Master's?
- Where's the fun in that?<eos> - Maybe this time, things end different.<eos> I'm sure it would.<eos> See you around, Boyd.<eos> Ava.<eos> Paden and Comstock are on the vault?<eos> They're the night shift.<eos> It's the night.<eos> - Where's Mr. Markham?<eos> - Lexington.
Sit down.<eos> I don't like feeling anything inside my canals.<eos> First you call me "ma'am," and then you don't blink after I put us in separate generations.<eos> Makes me wonder how old you think I am.<eos> No, ma'am ...<eos> I mean, Ms. Crowder ...<eos> I-I know exactly how old you are.<eos> My brother Carl was a freshman at evarts when you were a senior.<eos> He used to say you were the prettiest girl on Earth.<eos> On Earth?
Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, I have something I need to do right now, but maybe later, if you're not too busy...<eos> Definitely.<eos> I'll come by your place.<eos> I don't think I can handle too much more of Saint Melissa.<eos> Stay as long as you like.<eos> See you around.<eos> Sure, square.
And it's pretty clear that I'm part of the problem.<eos> You know, I used to think that just because my father... owned so much of this town that... that I should be the one to take charge.<eos> And now...<eos> What is it?<eos> It's Amanda.<eos> Hello.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I apologize for the late hour, but you have something that belongs to me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The liniment oil?
- Hmm?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Do you not have parents?<eos> Were you raised like Mowgli from The Jungle Book?<eos> I think I've seen you eat bugs.<eos> That was one time, and of course I have parents.<eos> Just, I don't want Danny to contact them because my parents don't know that Danny exists.<eos> What do you mean your parents don't know Danny exists?<eos> They know he exists, Peter.<eos> - Uh-huh. - As my co-worker.
Wesen what?<eos> You're bauerschwein.<eos> Nick's a grimm.<eos> Yeah, we know.<eos> I've been away too long.<eos> Does everybody in the precinct...<eos> No.<eos> And we're gonna keep it that way.<eos> Where'd you see the suspect?<eos> Oh, at another fire.
Rosalee, this is Peter Orson.<eos> He used to be an arson investigator.<eos> Used to be?<eos> All right, this doesn't really need to be awkward.<eos> I am in jail, but they got me out to help on a case.<eos> No. Not awkward at all.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Well, we need an ointment thick enough to handle some very intense heat.<eos> - How much heat?<eos> - Blowtorch heat.
I've been waiting for a moment to tell you that, and I guess... this is it.<eos> This is perfect.<eos> And, uh, just for the record, I love you, too.<eos> This speech is wonderful, so please keep going.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Um, and you can come to me with any problems or anything you want to ask me, but I'm gonna make some decisions that you don't like, and you're just gonna have to deal with it.<eos> So, uh, let's get back to work, okay?<eos> So, is that the end of the meeting, then?<eos> Uh... yeah, I got a little carried away with the moment there.<eos> Anyway...
Margaret, be reasonable.<eos> These mugs are chipped.<eos> This pot is stained.<eos> I don't care if they have holes in the goddamn bottom!<eos> Noah, get back here!<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> This is my daughter's house!<eos> This is her property!<eos> And the fact that you had the audacity to come and show your face here after what you've done to my family...<eos> Absolutely not!
I don't understand why you're even asking for joint custody when you live in a shack in the woods.<eos> It's a cabin. It's not a shack.<eos> Where are the children going to sleep?<eos> As soon as my book is finished, I'll get the rest of my advance, and then I'll rent an apartment in the city that's big enough for all of us.<eos> Really?<eos> A four-bedroom apartment?<eos> Well, the boys can share a room if...<eos> With your advance?<eos> Where in the city are you looking,<eos> Coney Island?
The rest is yours.<eos> If you leave it there, it's gonna stay there forever.<eos> You know, I actually like this work.<eos> Good for me to be working with my hands again.<eos> And I'm picking up some Spanish.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Turns out I'm not too bad at it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Say something.<eos> - In Spanish? - Mm-hmm.
You and your friends ever talk about Roger's father?<eos> But you've been to his house?<eos> Yeah, a couple times.<eos> Nice house.<eos> Nice pool.<eos> Nice tennis courts.<eos> You ever wonder where all that money came from?<eos> Doesn't he own a restaurant?<eos> Which comes in handy to launder all the money he makes as the biggest coke dealer<eos> - on the West Coast.
This is nice.<eos> I know, it's really terrible.<eos> She has family in Houston.<eos> They're gonna help her get into community college.<eos> I'm so happy for her.<eos> What about you, eh?<eos> You're not staying here forever.<eos> Once I save up enough, I want to get my own car.<eos> And have enough for my own place.<eos> Here in Santa?

And of all the moments... that you spent with Francis and myself, you...<eos> You believe that we're equals?<eos> I got fired, Mrs. Underwood.<eos> I'm not on the clock anymore.<eos> There's a lot more to Francis and me than what you wrote.<eos> Maybe so, but I never got a chance to ask.<eos> Then ask.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Why aren't you with him?<eos> In Iowa?
But she's on the mend and I'm flying to Washington tonight, so that tomorrow she and I can get on a plane and fly to New Hampshire, where we are gonna win there, too!<eos> Claire.<eos> They told me you were down here.<eos> I just wanted to come somewhere to think.<eos> Well, I hope you have.<eos> And that whatever was clouding your mind is gone.<eos> Because I just had to give a victory speech... alone.<eos> And one way or another, I need you on that plane with me tomorrow.<eos> No.<eos> The desk.
Where are you going?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> I was just joking!<eos> PARISIENNE<eos> Work around here?<eos> Work around here?<eos> I'm a student.<eos> Yeah?<eos> At a faculty?<eos> The university.

"He weighs flies' eggs on spider web scales."<eos> He means he's a nit-picker.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You need to fall in love to understand what Marivaux writes.<eos> That seething energy blithely contaminates each protagonist by sowing the seed of madness in the characters' behaviour.<eos> "In truth, "it all resembles a dream," says the maid in "Les Fausses Confidences".<eos> And it's that dream we'll be studying.<eos> You're not saying much.<eos> It's weird being here with you.<eos> In a château.

You listen to it loud.<eos> - He's in Paris on Friday.<eos> - What?<eos> Frank Black.<eos> He is?<eos> Want to come with me?<eos> Ok.<eos> I have to go or I'll miss the last metro.<eos> You're in the suburbs?<eos> No, in Paris, in a palace.
Singers use a sweeping technique.<eos> Frank Black didn't look at you.<eos> - You looked at me...<eos> - Yes, I missed half the gig.<eos> Got friends at uni?<eos> No...<eos> Yes, I have one friend.<eos> She's a royalist.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Of what?
- I can do that.<eos> I run fast.<eos> I'll be deported soon anyway...<eos> Come with us next time we post bills.<eos> - We're all going?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I can write too.<eos> About your adventures with Immigration?<eos> No, about Manet, say.<eos> Manet?
Entitled "evidence of a life."<eos> He took piles of paperwork --<eos> Birth certificates, school transcripts, Parking tickets, everything and anything -- And then he cut them into these thin, wispy strips<eos> Do we have any other background on the victim That's not cut into strips of paper?<eos> Timothy fitch, born and raised in maine.<eos> Parents deceased.<eos> Two siblings, one brother and one sister,.<eos> Both live in portland.<eos> Are they coming in?<eos> No, the other portland --
When she saw me watching her, she took off.<eos> Can you provide a description?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She looked just like fitch.<eos> Moss brady has identified arianna fitch, Timothy fitch's younger sister, As the mysterious woman<eos> She an artist, too?<eos> No.<eos> She is learning to care for large animals.<eos> Like at a circus?<eos> Veterinary school.
[ cries ] Here are the [sniffles] spare keys.<eos> I imagine moss has fitch's... [ breathing heavily ]<eos> Oh, god. Why didn't I stay here with him?<eos> I know this won't bring fitch back. [ sighs ]<eos> But we will catch whoever killed him. Yes, my real name is mark bradley.<eos> Moss brady is my art-world moniker.<eos> Mm, see, now, I wish I'd gone a bit more french. [ door closes ] you're a con artist.<eos> You've done time.<eos> You've got a record. Yes, and now I've gone straight.<eos> [ chuckles ] not sexually.
Do you remember me?<eos> You gave me my shoes.<eos> I need you to tell me about that club that you were carrying.<eos> The club is the source.<eos> The club gives me power.<eos> I am invincible with the club!<eos> Where did you get the club?<eos> I... found it.<eos> You found it where?<eos> In the alley?

Four successive lunar eclipses six months apart.<eos> The last in the cycle is tonight.<eos> The blood moon.<eos> Dupree was killed the same night the third girl got took.<eos> What is this?<eos> Looks like the killer had some fun with a branding iron.<eos> I'd best see the body.<eos> This a nice, nice home you got here, partner, for sure!<eos> Please... let me go...<eos> Jamais d'la vie!
Sounds reasonable.<eos> You can't ignore the warnings, John.<eos> Oh, every time I light up, I have the surgeon general harping on about bloody lung cancer, and look at me... fit as a fiddle.<eos> What's your point?<eos> My point is we can all shape our destiny, but none of us get to escape our fate.<eos> So when my time's up, that's it.<eos> Now, what is really going on here, Zed?<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> I saw Jim dead.<eos> In my vision.
Wow!<eos> You can't do that!<eos> At last you've got someone to impress!<eos> Now you've got someone!<eos> For your old school shit!<eos> Pistols?<eos> Got pistols on you?<eos> What's going on?<eos> What?<eos> What?
You know, they're stupid guys.<eos> - Boxer! Beer!<eos> Man, you're always causing trouble!<eos> Chill out, hey.<eos> Relax.<eos> It's the cops.<eos> Good evening!<eos> Have a slow dance with me for my birthday...<eos> Let's smoke a joint.<eos> To peace! Peace!
Good evening!<eos> Have a slow dance with me for my birthday...<eos> Let's smoke a joint.<eos> To peace! Peace!<eos> What are you going to do now?<eos> Are you going to party?<eos> Smoke a joint.<eos> For peace!<eos> Sometimes I just enjoy the harmony, you know?<eos> Those sons of bitches!
- OK.<eos> I told you.<eos> - Ah, you're stopping the bike!<eos> - I never stopped...<eos> Come on, drive, you.<eos> That's West Berlin guys, huh?<eos> That's real Berlin guys.<eos> You've messed up my cigarette.<eos> Take this beer.<eos> Hey, guys.
OK, maybe it's because I'm not into it right now, but I show you something.<eos> - Just with my eyes closed.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> Your face was so deep in... It was like...<eos> - Yeah, because it was deep.<eos> I know I'm good.<eos> Yeah, you're so good I think I'm falling in love with you right now.<eos> Really?<eos> - But do you play an instrument?<eos> What kind of instrument?
I look like that?<eos> - Yeah, you look like a little bit... But different.<eos> You put triangle like this... like a<eos> And if you look like this now?<eos> How I look? I look like a triangle girl also?<eos> But it's a compliment!<eos> - That's a compliment?<eos> I think you should go out of my cafe right now.<eos> - OK, now I know what you're playing.<eos> A drummer...
- He called.<eos> - Yeah, you said!<eos> - Can't I just talk in peace?<eos> - Let's go!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Do we have to meet him?<eos> - Of course we have to!<eos> - Yes, but why now?<eos> - So let's go!<eos> - OK!
- Where do you live!<eos> - Upstairs, one floor up!<eos> Let us in!<eos> - Move your ass!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> - OK, OK!<eos> Hurry "P!<eos> On the floor!<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> In the living room!
Right, yes.<eos> They did. We did.<eos> I just wanted to do a follow up, if that's OK?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> I wanted to ask you both some questions about what happened at the theatre.<eos> Well, we settled down to watch the play.<eos> 20 minutes in, an usher comes along and tells me that I need to take Howard out.<eos> No Synths allowed.<eos> But Howard's not just some Synth.<eos> In what way?
Anyway, that's that.<eos> Then, I was thinking, what if it's not an isolated incident?<eos> If there are more Synths out there who can kill?<eos> Well, we're all screwed then, aren't we?<eos> Powerful message, ain't it?<eos> "We are people."<eos> Folks needs reminding sometimes... reminding we're supposed to be the dominant species.<eos> We're going to win it, you know?<eos> Win what?<eos> The war.
Not even.<eos> So, how's the musical coming, Hammerstein?<eos> It's coming. I mean, the lyrics are there. I'm just pulling lines from the book.<eos> I mean, I can read music but writing it is...<eos> Yeah, totally different skill.<eos> Hey, would you, um...<eos> Just... could you listen?<eos> Sure, I got a second.<eos> ♪ it's a whole new ball game ♪ ♪ nowadays ♪ ♪ so join us on our ♪<eos> ♪ nowadays. ♪

- This is my car.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> At nine a.m., it became city property.<eos> Loading zone only.<eos> - Please.<eos> I can move it.<eos> - Not once it's hitched.<eos> But you can come to the impound on 49th to reclaim it any time before six p.m.<eos> Lloyd, what the hell are you doing?<eos> What?
- My bills aren't a problem.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Have you at least started answering the phone?<eos> Only you could turn that big personal victory into a defeat.<eos> - You know what your problem is?<eos> - Sentences that start like that.<eos> You're not comfortable with what you've become.<eos> - Jessica, you are now a full-blown super...<eos> - Do not say the H-word.<eos> - Jess, I...
I'm talking to you.<eos> And I appreciate that.<eos> - Is there whiskey in this?<eos> - Oh, yeah, that's mine.<eos> Looks like all of your paper-pushing worked.<eos> Uncuff the superstar.<eos> Get him out of my sight.<eos> My bad.<eos> These belong to you.<eos> Mr. Lucas?

Your Honor, unless Mr. Murdock can prove my client actually received these hypothetical documents, then...<eos> It's not about whether he received them.<eos> It's whether he willfully ignored them.<eos> Your Honor, I ask that this record of delivery be admitted into evidence.<eos> - I mean, I get a lot of those.<eos> - What would you say is worse?<eos> Ignoring data in the interest of cutting costs?<eos> Or neglecting to supply the court with records that might prove you purposely put people in danger?<eos> - Including...<eos> - Your Honor...
It's okay.<eos> You can be proud of yourself.<eos> A little.<eos> I won't tell anyone.<eos> You, uh, here for a statement?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Hey, you maybe wanna go... do that over a bite or...<eos> Oh, uh... Sure, yeah.<eos> - Um... can you give me five minutes? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Mr. Murdock...

That's not helpful.<eos> Or even what I asked.<eos> Well, unfortunately, even for someone with your resources... there's not much we can do.<eos> Um... how much time do I have left?<eos> Could be months. Could be weeks.<eos> I think this should give us more definitive answers.<eos> Please.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Shit.

We weren't sure if we were in the right place.<eos> Not today.<eos> Probably not tomorrow, either.<eos> - Come on, Mom.<eos> - I read about what you did.<eos> She doesn't give a shit.<eos> - My husband is missing.<eos> - She's a walking shit show anyway.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Lexi, please.
- Lexi, please.<eos> We are not doing great.<eos> He has been gone a full week.<eos> - Did you call the cops?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> They're free.<eos> - Money is not an issue.<eos> Something is wrong and I know it.<eos> John's like clockwork.
- And it's not like him.<eos> Because he's cheating on you, okay?<eos> Nothing to be ashamed about.<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> - You don't know him like I do.<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> But you came to me and I'm giving you my professional opinion.<eos> You need a divorce lawyer.<eos> Thank you for your time, Ms. Jones.<eos> Yeah, thanks so much.
- You don't know him like I do.<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> But you came to me and I'm giving you my professional opinion.<eos> You need a divorce lawyer.<eos> Thank you for your time, Ms. Jones.<eos> Yeah, thanks so much.<eos> Whatever he's doing... I hope you find him.<eos> Wrong number.<eos> Jessica Jones, do yourself a favor and don't look for John Raymond.<eos> Hello?

Yeah?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Well, I hope I was worth it.<eos> You got potential.<eos> - "Potential"? Yeah?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> There were some really rough days inside.<eos> But your letters... they got me through it.<eos> I can't remember the last time I handwrote a letter.<eos> - There was that poem that one time.<eos> - Oh, God.
- Oh, God.<eos> - No, it was a good one.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I mean, it was also Nikki Giovanni. - Shh!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We all can't be your corny ass.<eos> Hey, I'd rather be corny than to plagiarize.<eos> Ow! There was something else I noticed about your letters...<eos> What you didn't say.<eos> - Luke...
Look, right now, the only thing you need to worry about is you.<eos> Look, if you're talking about getting a job, I have every intention of doing just that.<eos> Doing what?<eos> How does being Harlem's hero allow you to live an actual life?<eos> I'll find a way.<eos> Right now, just... I just wanna help people.<eos> I wanna do that, too.<eos> But call me selfish... I wanna see you take care of yourself.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Hey.

It feels like what I'm meant to be doing or...<eos> I don't know if that makes any sense.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> It looks like you're doing what you always wanted to.<eos> Yeah, it's been a transition from the Nelson and Murdock days, from the partnership but, uh...<eos> No, the pro bono work does make me happy.<eos> - That's great.<eos> That's really...<eos> - Coffee?
Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> It looks like you're doing what you always wanted to.<eos> Yeah, it's been a transition from the Nelson and Murdock days, from the partnership but, uh...<eos> No, the pro bono work does make me happy.<eos> - That's great.<eos> That's really...<eos> - Coffee?<eos> - Yes, thank you.<eos> - Thanks.

Thanks.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> The suit?<eos> The mask?<eos> No.<eos> It feels like a chapter of my life that's closed.<eos> Now, I don't regret it. You know, I just...<eos> - I regret that it drove some people away.<eos> - No, it...
The NYPD is prevailing.<eos> I report on it every day, and crime rate's down.<eos> I really think that Daredevil may have made the city a safer place.<eos> He might have.<eos> But right now, the city's better off without him.<eos> Well, it's better off with Matt Murdock.<eos> Speaking of which, Mr. Murdock...<eos> I would like to take your statement on today's miraculous Aaron James verdict.<eos> Hit me.<eos> Hey.

Door was broken, and I was doing you a favor.<eos> - What do you want, Malcolm?<eos> - Just came for soda.<eos> - Ooh! So what are we doing?<eos> - We are doing nothing.<eos> You took a case.<eos> I can tell.<eos> - You've got that glow about you.<eos> - I did not take a case...<eos> - yet.

Bet you loved that, didn't you?<eos> Graduated MIT.<eos> Designed two skyscrapers in Dubai and four in Manhattan.<eos> He is squeaky clean.<eos> You think she's right?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe he's tired of being the good guy.<eos> Maybe he's on a bender.<eos> Maybe he's knee-deep in some intern.<eos> - Gross.
- Very.<eos> So, what are your leads?<eos> I'm not looking for leads, Malcolm, because I haven't take the case.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Have you tried tracking the call yet?<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> You can reroute phone numbers.<eos> I mean, maybe he didn't, though.<eos> Maybe he's just a regular guy trying to throw you off the scent.<eos> - Maybe...

I wish it was that easy.<eos> I know their hands are in something.<eos> Maybe you need another assist from outside the law.<eos> - From somebody fresh out of lockup?<eos> - That's behind me.<eos> Now that I've cleared up my past, I've got nothing to hide.<eos> Look, my team is on it.<eos> But Harlem could use your help... once you're done spending nights with the nurse<eos> - who tied the ribbon round the oak tree.<eos> - Your team, eh?

Down payment in cash.<eos> What's the connection between them?<eos> Run their names, you talk to people...<eos> No guns, no drugs, just a new job, off the books.<eos> Doing what?<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> You ready for the real sad part?<eos> You remember Candace?<eos> This close to testifying against Mariah?<eos> Murder still unsolved?
Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord... looks on the heart."<eos> If you could elaborate, Father.<eos> Ignoring doesn't change anything, Matthew.<eos> God knows your heart.<eos> Let him in so he can help.<eos> - Even if that heart is damaged?<eos> - Especially if it's damaged.<eos> Matthew, I want to talk frankly.<eos> - Please. - This other life you led... is your heart still with it... or is your heart with the one who walked through it by your side?<eos> Elektra.
If we speed the process, it will not be quiet.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> I will inform the others.<eos> Good.<eos> Send my regards when you do.<eos> And, uh... finish feeding the birds, will you?<eos> They're starving today.<eos> You guys know where I can find Cole?<eos> What's it to you?<eos> Uh, one floor up.

No, what happened to Sean was, um... was more like an accident.<eos> - You sure about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I heard he got a new job.<eos> I ain't know nothing about that.<eos> I mean, we didn't talk about everything.<eos> That was his business.<eos> Of course.<eos> What about you?<eos> What?
- I hear you.<eos> I'm gonna get it.<eos> You got till the end of the day, or I'm coming back here to bust some shit up!<eos> Hey, John Raymond, it's Jessica Jones.<eos> I'm, uh... returning your call.<eos> You remember the one where you tried to scare me?<eos> The guy downstairs said you were here.<eos> Dude, I don't care what weird shit you're into, but we gotta talk.<eos> All right, well, you're gonna pay for this.<eos> Holy shit.
You can go.<eos> - Greatest city in the world.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> New Yorkers like saying that.<eos> Still, after all this time, I...<eos> I don't know how I feel about it.<eos> That's the beauty of it.<eos> It can be whatever you need it to be.<eos> What do you need it to be?<eos> Home.

What's happening?<eos> All units, we got a 10-66.<eos> Requesting backup immediately.<eos> - I can't open my door!<eos> - Take what you can.<eos> Hey!<eos> What the hell do you kids think you're doing?<eos> - Shit!
Don't you run from me... you looter sons of bitches!<eos> There they go!<eos> Get the other gun!<eos> Guys, hurry!<eos> They're coming!<eos> Hurry, this way!<eos> Come on!<eos> Please, stop.<eos> We'll leave...<eos> Oh, shit!
Please, stop.<eos> We'll leave...<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Run!<eos> Come on, you pieces of shit!<eos> You want some, too?<eos> Don't do it.<eos> They're just kids.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Hey, Jess.
Brooklyn's outside the affected area.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, whatever it was, you're reporting it wrong.<eos> Look, I know it's easy to give into fear, but...<eos> I'm no conspiracy theorist.<eos> I'm a geologist.<eos> Shallow earthquakes can be up to 50-miles deep.<eos> But whatever happened last night was only 300-feet deep...<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Hello?
I want your thoughts next.<eos> Trish Talk, stay tuned.<eos> Thanks for listening.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> The interview with the school superintendent, boss says it's going on now.<eos> - Did you cut off my call?<eos> - They called from upstairs.<eos> Said we gotta lay off the earthquake stuff.<eos> I don't know why, but from the tone they used, it was not a conversation.<eos> Detective Knight.
Son of a bitch.<eos> I told you these assholes were transporting explosives.<eos> We sure it's them?<eos> Uh, at the very least, I think it's connected.<eos> Maybe the fireworks are theirs, and maybe somebody stole them from 'em.<eos> I just sign the overtime.<eos> This shit's for you to figure out.<eos> - Well, who called this in?<eos> - Oh, now that's where it gets funny.<eos> Jessica Jones.
So the guy who rented this room...<eos> I already told you, I didn't see him.<eos> He was gone before I got here.<eos> Now I have been here four hours.<eos> Can I go now, dipshit?<eos> You're done when we're done.<eos> You got a mouth.<eos> You noticed.<eos> Ms. Jones, you can go for now.<eos> Stupid son of a bitch.
You noticed.<eos> Ms. Jones, you can go for now.<eos> Stupid son of a bitch.<eos> Can you believe this chick?<eos> Did she just take...<eos> Looks like we're good.<eos> I don't see any damage.<eos> And thank God.<eos> No one told me I'd need earthquake insurance in New York.<eos> Danny?

It's not a break.<eos> I'm refocusing.<eos> If I ever come across that warrior again, I'll be prepared.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I've been thinking about the man who died in the sewer.<eos> He called you Iron Fist.<eos> He knew something.<eos> He wasn't just a victim.<eos> I...
Yeah.<eos> You keep saying that, but whoever he was, he was trained.<eos> And he was also willing to die.<eos> He might not have died if I hadn't left my post in K'un-Lun.<eos> - I know that you are angry...<eos> - This isn't about anger.<eos> It's about fault.<eos> All I'm saying is you're not the only person the Hand has ever hurt.<eos> It was his fight, too.<eos> And mine.

It was a Tsukamoto.<eos> There are maybe ten of these in the world.<eos> There is a workshop here in New York.<eos> One of the world's best.<eos> If the guy who died in Cambodia ever had business here, maybe it was at that workshop.<eos> And what if he didn't?<eos> Then we keep looking.<eos> What if it's a trap?<eos> Then we fight our way out of it.<eos> Danny, what?

Hey, Foggy.<eos> Just keep it clean.<eos> Not a lot of people have insurance here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> At least nobody died.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> You know, most people get out of jail and they, uh... pop a beer.<eos> Maybe I will go get a drink.<eos> I was thinking about going by Elmore's tonight.<eos> - Elmore's?
It was a direct response.<eos> All Brahms wanted was to prove that he could do it, too.<eos> He was petty like that.<eos> Your insight on music history, it never ceases to amaze me.<eos> Oh, it's nothing.<eos> It's just stuff I picked up along the way.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> Of course.<eos> - There's been a complication.<eos> - What kind?
It's meant to be opened.<eos> By what?<eos> The conviction of the elders of K'un-Lun was always unwavering.<eos> They think it's a virtue.<eos> But in the end, all it ever did was make them predictable.<eos> They've locked it away.<eos> But a lock is not a lock without a key.<eos> And from the beginning, they have valued one thing above all else.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?
They've locked it away.<eos> But a lock is not a lock without a key.<eos> And from the beginning, they have valued one thing above all else.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?<eos> You've gotta be kidding me.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> - Okay?
I'm confused.<eos> - Okay?<eos> I'm looking into this company, but they've been transferring assets from one corporation to the next.<eos> Like, they're changing their name, shell company stuff.<eos> Yet, I have no idea what it is they actually do.<eos> Oh, so what do you need from me?<eos> The oldest record dates back to 1820, but as crazy as this sounds, I need to go back further than that.<eos> Oh, well, you... you wanna go to the historical branch uptown.<eos> And you'll need an appointment.<eos> Okay, thanks.

Been a long time, Josie.<eos> I can't tell you how much I miss this place.<eos> Oh, so Mr. Uptown misses our humble establishment.<eos> How's work?<eos> I heard about that settlement.<eos> - Eleven million.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You sure you want to stay pro bono?<eos> I'm just happy I could help.<eos> - Thanks, Josie. - Hmm.

But I do think I can help you through it.<eos> I came to offer you something.<eos> These are case files.<eos> Stuff I'm too busy to handle right now.<eos> Ranging from petty bullshit to life-changingly important.<eos> - Come on, I don't need your charity.<eos> - This isn't that.<eos> It's outsourcing.<eos> Most importantly, it's the type of stuff you're doing anyway.<eos> Malpractice.
- This isn't that.<eos> It's outsourcing.<eos> Most importantly, it's the type of stuff you're doing anyway.<eos> Malpractice.<eos> Workmen's comp.<eos> Good people who need justice.<eos> If you take these, it'll keep you up-to-your-eyeballs busy.<eos> And the next time you're on the fence about stepping out at night... you'll be too busy being another kind of hero.<eos> It's not a solution.<eos> Not long-term.
In a city of nine million people, we just happen to bump into each other?<eos> Are you having me followed?<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> - You haven't returned my calls.<eos> - I haven't returned anybody's calls.<eos> I couldn't help but take it personally.<eos> Maybe you should.<eos> I'm here to ask you to be careful.<eos> - Be careful why?<eos> - FBI, Homeland Security.
- I haven't returned anybody's calls.<eos> I couldn't help but take it personally.<eos> Maybe you should.<eos> I'm here to ask you to be careful.<eos> - Be careful why?<eos> - FBI, Homeland Security.<eos> Whatever it is you stumbled onto last night, it's big.<eos> I didn't stumble onto anything.<eos> I took a case on purpose.<eos> - Oh, I...
It's now a matter of national security.<eos> Which means hundreds of law enforcement officers.<eos> All hands on deck.<eos> Every ego on display.<eos> All it takes is one overzealous agent who wants to save the world, and this man, John Raymond, and anyone suspected of aiding him will be shot on sight.<eos> There is nothing in this guy's profile that suggests he's a terrorist.<eos> They just found enough C-4 in that motel room to level a city block.<eos> What do you think it looks like?<eos> The government is not going to rest until they've got him.<eos> I just...
This only looks like plastic, but I'm telling you it's solid gold.<eos> Earthquake has everyone going crazy.<eos> Nobody's paying attention to the little things, like what is or isn't in their wallets.<eos> - Welcome back, big man.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - This is how you talk?<eos> - I want answers, Turk.<eos> How I get 'em is up to you.<eos> Cage, what part of this shit looks like it's up to me?<eos> Mariah and Shades...
Cage, what part of this shit looks like it's up to me?<eos> Mariah and Shades...<eos> I need to know what they're up to.<eos> Far as I know, nothing.<eos> They ghosted right after you left.<eos> If they got their hands in anything, it ain't stuff I've seen.<eos> Then who's recruiting kids out of Harlem and getting them killed?<eos> Kids?<eos> Man, do I look like the PTA?<eos> Late-night work.
No one seems to know what they're doing.<eos> Look, I'd love to help, but I don't know shit.<eos> I think you do.<eos> Okay!<eos> I heard about it!<eos> But ain't nobody come asking me, okay?<eos> I'm too old-school for this anyway.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> And who are they doing it for?<eos> Some new guy.
I heard about it!<eos> But ain't nobody come asking me, okay?<eos> I'm too old-school for this anyway.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> And who are they doing it for?<eos> Some new guy.<eos> Can't miss him.<eos> I don't know his name.<eos> Everyone just calls him White Hat on account of his unique fashion sense.<eos> Real deal African brother, too, man.
White suit, Panama hat, alligator shoes.<eos> - Where can I find him?<eos> - I've only seen him a couple times.<eos> Try around 151st and Amsterdam.<eos> If this isn't the truth, I'll be back.<eos> And you won't like me then.<eos> I don't like you now.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is it weird that I wanna live here?<eos> Danny.
I don't like you now.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is it weird that I wanna live here?<eos> Danny.<eos> Danny, this is a Tsukamoto.<eos> Just like the one you showed me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you don't sharpen these.<eos> Unless you plan on using them.<eos> Danny...
Unless you plan on using them.<eos> Danny...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It hasn't been long.<eos> He's still warm.<eos> Someone was dragged out of here.<eos> This must have been the Hand.<eos> Then who are these people?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Danny?
What is it?<eos> It's K'un-Lun.<eos> - Misty, it's Luke.<eos> - Hey. I think I found something.<eos> You should get a warrant and get down here.<eos> - Am I making arrests?<eos> - Think so.<eos> It's about those kids.<eos> I may have found a lead.<eos> Luke?

She has a tendency to go rogue.<eos> Her name is Jessica Jones.<eos> Now you and I never had this conversation, but the second she gets herself into trouble, priority one is keeping that trouble very far away from us.<eos> Okay.<eos> So...<eos> Sorry, uh, just to be clear... this is all just in case?<eos> She's not in trouble now?<eos> I wish.<eos> With Jessica, it's just a matter of time.<eos> Hey.
Sorry, uh, just to be clear... this is all just in case?<eos> She's not in trouble now?<eos> I wish.<eos> With Jessica, it's just a matter of time.<eos> Hey.<eos> Jess, where have you been?<eos> - Sorry, I had a long day.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> Something weird's going on at the studio.<eos> Weird how?
Who's they?<eos> Who do you think is after you?<eos> I can't tell you. I...<eos> This... this is not me.<eos> I'm a good man.<eos> Make sure you tell her that.<eos> Okay, with any luck, you're gonna tell her that yourself.<eos> Now your family is worried.<eos> They just wanted to know what happened.<eos> And the cops...
I can't tell you. I...<eos> This... this is not me.<eos> I'm a good man.<eos> Make sure you tell her that.<eos> Okay, with any luck, you're gonna tell her that yourself.<eos> Now your family is worried.<eos> They just wanted to know what happened.<eos> And the cops...<eos> They just wanna know why you started stockpiling explosives.<eos> What?
And the cops...<eos> They just wanna know why you started stockpiling explosives.<eos> What?<eos> There's nowhere to go.<eos> They'll find me.<eos> They'll... they'll hurt me.<eos> To be honest, if you hurt my friend, I'm gonna hurt you worse.<eos> I was just trying to stop them.<eos> - They're gonna take down the city.<eos> - Who?
- They're gonna take down the city.<eos> - Who?<eos> I can't help you if you won't tell me who.<eos> I should never have come here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's too late.<eos> You can't have this.<eos> You okay?<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> - Shit.
I should never have come here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's too late.<eos> You can't have this.<eos> You okay?<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Turn around.<eos> Get your hands up!<eos> Now!
Oh, my God.<eos> It's too late.<eos> You can't have this.<eos> You okay?<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Turn around.<eos> Get your hands up!<eos> Now!<eos> Hey there, assholes.
- You all right?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> In between gigs, huh?<eos> - You back for more?<eos> - Oh... we've not even started.<eos> What are you made of?<eos> Just remember, you started this.<eos> Stay down.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Danny!
- Oh... we've not even started.<eos> What are you made of?<eos> Just remember, you started this.<eos> Stay down.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Danny!<eos> We have to go!<eos> Get on your knees, now!<eos> On your knees!<eos> Hands in the air!
You know who I am, I know who you are, so let's skip the wartime banter.<eos> Time is not something I can afford to waste.<eos> Not for your benefit but for mine, I'm taking the blinds off.<eos> Try not to bite, old friend.<eos> It's undignified.<eos> Alexandra.<eos> Stick.<eos> We have so much to talk about.<eos> - Are these necessary?<eos> - Standard protocol.
Stick.<eos> We have so much to talk about.<eos> - Are these necessary?<eos> - Standard protocol.<eos> Nothing personal.<eos> John Raymond, the body we found in your office slash apartment.<eos> Malcolm Ducasse, your friend being interrogated down the hall.<eos> And Jessica...<eos> - Look, I don't know what...<eos> - Jones.
Thank you, Kadir.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Please tell your wife she makes it even better than they did in Constantinople.<eos> I think you mean Istanbul, ma'am.<eos> Constantinople, this is its ancient name.<eos> Of course.<eos> The Black Sky.
I know you're afraid, but that will pass.<eos> So will the pain.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Stand down.<eos> This is your home now.<eos> We are your family.<eos> I have waited so long to meet you.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy, my child.
I have waited so long to meet you.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy, my child.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You'll need your strength.<eos> Language will come back to you.<eos> So will your instincts.<eos> But everything else...
Easy, my child.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You'll need your strength.<eos> Language will come back to you.<eos> So will your instincts.<eos> But everything else...<eos> I'm afraid it wasn't worth keeping anyway.<eos> You...
Easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You'll need your strength.<eos> Language will come back to you.<eos> So will your instincts.<eos> But everything else...<eos> I'm afraid it wasn't worth keeping anyway.<eos> You...<eos> You...
You...<eos> My name is Alexandra.<eos> You were born.<eos> You lived and died.<eos> And what you saw on the other side... the darkness, the absence of everything... it's horrifying, isn't it?<eos> I have seen it, too.<eos> More than once.<eos> And all I want in this life is never to see it again.<eos> But now that we've been brought together... that's not something we need to worry about.<eos> Who?

He thinks he's a one-man army.<eos> He's a real handful.<eos> I've seen better.<eos> Still, you'll spend the rest of your days looking over your shoulder.<eos> And from what I hear... those days are numbered.<eos> Now...<eos> - that's the Alexandra I know.<eos> - Pay attention.<eos> You make a new friend?<eos> No, Stick.

I'll die before I let him join your army.<eos> You think I want him to fight for me?<eos> He's a weapon.<eos> You're a monster.<eos> What else?<eos> After a lifetime of serving K'un-Lun... you don't even know what he is.<eos> No.<eos> But I know what I am.<eos> You asked for it...<eos> Elektra.
What else?<eos> After a lifetime of serving K'un-Lun... you don't even know what he is.<eos> No.<eos> But I know what I am.<eos> You asked for it...<eos> Elektra.<eos> You'll die here tonight, old man.<eos> - Finally.<eos> - Don't you bet on it.<eos> Son of a bitch.
Uh, I'm independent.<eos> I don't work for her firm.<eos> - Well, I'm not paying you.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - Oh, 'cause she'll foot the bill?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I'm a Catholic.<eos> I have a soft spot for hopeless causes.<eos> - That was a bad joke.<eos> Sorry.
- Okay, great.<eos> Then...<eos> Look, I'm... I'm just saying, legally, if there's anything, this will stay between us if... this was...<eos> There's anything not, uh, ordinary about this case.<eos> What part of "I know the drill" did you not understand?<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Great.<eos> Then I guess you're free to go.<eos> Malcolm?
That kid, Cole... cops just picked him up.<eos> - He's probably in jail by now. - Hmm.<eos> - I left him behind, Claire.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You're better off not in prison.<eos> I like you here.<eos> What happened?<eos> I got clocked.<eos> - By White Hat?
I got clocked.<eos> - By White Hat?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't know who he was.<eos> But when he hit me, it felt like a sledgehammer.<eos> He had this... this hand.<eos> I think it glowed.<eos> Glowed how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just some skinny white kid.
He had this fist and...<eos> - Who you calling?<eos> - There's someone that you need to meet.<eos> - He punched me.<eos> - You punched first.<eos> Seriously?<eos> - How come he can't be hurt?<eos> - What's the deal with that fist?<eos> - I earned it.<eos> - You what?
I came to you.. for answers. And now...<eos> Well, the NYPD is on the case, but between us, I would like to keep investigating.<eos> - You mean without the police?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how much I can afford.<eos> - Don't worry about that right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, is there anything you haven't told me?<eos> Drugs?
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, is there anything you haven't told me?<eos> Drugs?<eos> You know, gambling, weird fetish shit?<eos> Was there any world<eos> - that he was a part of?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> Why?
And that's it.<eos> That was his whole life.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Hi, sweetie. How are you?<eos> - Hi, Mom. I'm okay.<eos> I'm sure we'll find out soon.<eos> Why don't we lay you down, and you can let me fix you supper.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Um... tell your mom I let myself out.<eos> Hello?
I'll be right back.<eos> - Hi, sweetie. How are you?<eos> - Hi, Mom. I'm okay.<eos> I'm sure we'll find out soon.<eos> Why don't we lay you down, and you can let me fix you supper.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Um... tell your mom I let myself out.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, I'm returning a call from Ms. Anna Asher.<eos> - What?
I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Um... tell your mom I let myself out.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, I'm returning a call from Ms. Anna Asher.<eos> - What?<eos> - This is Duncan and Dotter Design.<eos> Oh, right, this is her. Sorry.<eos> - Um, can you come in this afternoon?<eos> - Sure.<eos> 211 10th Avenue, suite 305.

- Um, can you come in this afternoon?<eos> - Sure.<eos> 211 10th Avenue, suite 305.<eos> - 305.<eos> Got it.<eos> - Thank you, Ms. Asher.<eos> You can fight.<eos> You can take a punch.<eos> Claire said they did experiments on you.<eos> Long story.
- Sure.<eos> 211 10th Avenue, suite 305.<eos> - 305.<eos> Got it.<eos> - Thank you, Ms. Asher.<eos> You can fight.<eos> You can take a punch.<eos> Claire said they did experiments on you.<eos> Long story.<eos> What kind?
Long story.<eos> What kind?<eos> Was it voluntary?<eos> They made me this way.<eos> That's all you need to know.<eos> What did you mean, "chi"?<eos> It's a... It's an energy force.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - We all have it.<eos> Not like that.
I know how it sounds, but it's true.<eos> You gotta admit, that dragon shit, from the outside... - does sound pretty crazy. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You really think they can help each other out?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Once they're done with the pissing contest who knows?<eos> Claire says you're a good guy.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> She says you've done a lot for Harlem.<eos> Yeah, I just... just wanna help.<eos> Me, too.
- He needed a job.<eos> - That's not an excuse.<eos> You never fought someone to protect someone else?<eos> - Of course I have.<eos> - Okay, so what's the difference?<eos> The difference is I live on their block.<eos> The difference is I'm not some billionaire white boy who takes justice into his own hands and slams a black kid against the wall because of his personal vendetta.<eos> Claire told me about you on the way over here.<eos> Not all the mystical parts, but everything else.<eos> The money?
And I know privilege when I see it.<eos> You may think you earned your strength, but you had power the day you were born.<eos> Before the dragons.<eos> Before the chi.<eos> You have the ability to change the world without getting anybody hurt.<eos> These people won't be stopped that way.<eos> You're taking the war to the ones at the bottom, is that it?<eos> If I were in your shoes, I'd think twice about using that thing on people who are trying to feed their families.<eos> This isn't gonna work out, it's obvious.<eos> Good luck, man.
About what?<eos> The Fist is one way to win this war, but I do have others.<eos> Yeah... and you've tried 'em.<eos> They're the Hand, you can't just buy 'em.<eos> I'm not talking about money.<eos> I have connections, access.<eos> He doesn't understand what we're really up against.<eos> He doesn't get how dangerous they are.<eos> I know, but... why am I fighting street-level operatives when I have the power to go right to the top?<eos> Because, Danny, you...
I have connections, access.<eos> He doesn't understand what we're really up against.<eos> He doesn't get how dangerous they are.<eos> I know, but... why am I fighting street-level operatives when I have the power to go right to the top?<eos> Because, Danny, you...<eos> You're not a businessman.<eos> I know.<eos> But my father was.<eos> I know, but you are a fighter.<eos> A warrior.
I know.<eos> But my father was.<eos> I know, but you are a fighter.<eos> A warrior.<eos> That's what you know.<eos> That's... that's what's in your heart.<eos> And a good warrior uses every tool at his disposal.<eos> I own 51% of a major corporation.<eos> I've got to try this another way.<eos> Hello?
There was an organization that did business with us last year.<eos> - We did lots of business.<eos> - Yeah, they call themselves the Hand.<eos> - You need help spelling that?<eos> - Look, whatever you heard, it's true.<eos> I know you're scared, but we can't leave until you help us.<eos> - Help you how?<eos> - We tailed 'em.<eos> We tracked 'em to SÃ£o Paulo.<eos> Berlin.

I know you're scared, but we can't leave until you help us.<eos> - Help you how?<eos> - We tailed 'em.<eos> We tracked 'em to SÃ£o Paulo.<eos> Berlin.<eos> Moscow.<eos> They set up shell companies, worldwide.<eos> We think they're doing something here in New York.<eos> We need you to help us find it.<eos> - SÃ£o Paulo, Berlin and Moscow? - Uh-huh.

- Uh, Paris, Miami...<eos> - Phnom Penh, Cambodia.<eos> I'm cross-referencing short-term holdings through those cities.<eos> Two hundred exist in the overlap.<eos> Three of them shut down last year.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Not much, except that they were shut down on the same day.<eos> Before they closed, they all made deposits into one place here in New York.<eos> I just need a name.<eos> Um... Midland Circle Financial.
After hours.<eos> No.<eos> There's another way to attack.<eos> And I gotta do this alone.<eos> - Gorgeous, isn't it? - Mmm.<eos> Like all of our projects, it was built with sustainability in mind.<eos> - Yeah, I am super into that.<eos> - I'm glad, Ms. Asher.<eos> Now, why don't you tell me what you envisioned for your company's...<eos> - Communal workspace. - Ah.
- Yeah, I am super into that.<eos> - I'm glad, Ms. Asher.<eos> Now, why don't you tell me what you envisioned for your company's...<eos> - Communal workspace. - Ah.<eos> Um, I mean, we're gonna need a juice bar.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Uh, standing desks.<eos> You know those bouncy balls that people sit on that some people find annoying?<eos> I think it should be modern and high-tech, but also so simple.<eos> A pragmatic utopia.
- I'm sorry?<eos> - Anything from this year?<eos> - Not that I've done. - Mmm.<eos> How about any other architect in your firm?<eos> Just because it's really important for our brand that we're not only on the cutting edge, but we are the cutting edge.<eos> Yes, but... can you keep a secret?<eos> I am the face of discretion.<eos> I can show you our most recent work.<eos> A building in Hell's Kitchen, designed by my colleague John Raymond.<eos> - Wow. - Midland Circle.
You know, he'd been bringin' me these since he was eight years old?<eos> At first, I didn't know how he was paying for them.<eos> And then I realized he was using his lunch money.<eos> He said it was worth it... to keep the dream alive.<eos> How 'bout some cookies?<eos> Chocolate chip.<eos> Did he tell you I keep them?<eos> There's a... a box in there, but it's too high up for me.<eos> Cole's always the one who does it.<eos> Hello?

My baby...

- Not like this.<eos> Right this way.<eos> My name is Danny Rand.<eos> Last year, you illegally transferred $243 million worth of assets through my family's company.<eos> And you thought you got away with it.<eos> But I know who you are.<eos> You killed my parents, attacked my home.<eos> You're the Hand.<eos> And I'm gonna make sure...<eos> Mr. Rand.
And I'm gonna make sure...<eos> Mr. Rand.<eos> I appreciate your candor.<eos> And your passion.<eos> And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.<eos> - And who are you?<eos> - I'm in charge.<eos> But, please, go on.<eos> You were telling us what you were going to do.<eos> - Murdock!
And?<eos> And you can't hide anymore.<eos> - Does it look like we're hiding?<eos> - Behind Midland Circle Financial.<eos> Behind corporate shells, or street-level criminals who don't know who they're working for.<eos> It's what you do.<eos> But I'm here to expose you.<eos> I am the Immortal Iron Fist, weapon of K'un-Lun.<eos> - And I'm fulfilling my destiny.<eos> - K'un-Lun.
It's what you do.<eos> But I'm here to expose you.<eos> I am the Immortal Iron Fist, weapon of K'un-Lun.<eos> - And I'm fulfilling my destiny.<eos> - K'un-Lun.<eos> How is it these days?<eos> You're gonna lose everything.<eos> Just like I did.<eos> You haven't lost everything, Mr. Rand.<eos> Not yet.

- How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.<eos> This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.<eos> I've crossed paths with Iron Fists before, but this is different, because this time...<eos> I won't kill you.<eos> No use using her for protection.<eos> They will rip right through her to get to you.<eos> Come on!<eos> - You?<eos> - Me.
No use using her for protection.<eos> They will rip right through her to get to you.<eos> Come on!<eos> - You?<eos> - Me.<eos> So punching's okay now?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> You look like an asshole.<eos> It's your scarf.<eos> - Jessica?
They will rip right through her to get to you.<eos> Come on!<eos> - You?<eos> - Me.<eos> So punching's okay now?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> You look like an asshole.<eos> It's your scarf.<eos> - Jessica?<eos> - Luke.

It's complicated.<eos> You look like an asshole.<eos> It's your scarf.<eos> - Jessica?<eos> - Luke.<eos> - How you been?<eos> - Long story.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> - Who's he?<eos> - Longer story.
We have to get out of here.<eos> - Who's he?<eos> - Longer story.<eos> Who's he?<eos> Wait.<eos> There's someone else coming.<eos> Something else.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Oh, shit.
- Longer story.<eos> Who's he?<eos> Wait.<eos> There's someone else coming.<eos> Something else.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Bad news.
Wait.<eos> There's someone else coming.<eos> Something else.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Bad news.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Elektra?
Thank you so much for coming.<eos> - Good to see you again.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thanks.
I still hear neon.<eos> Who hears neon?<eos> My blind-but-maybe-not lawyer. You're what?<eos> What do you mean he's blind?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I thought he was sent to spy on me, and now I'm not so sure.<eos> - You think he's on our side?<eos> - Our side of what?<eos> - Who's Karate Kid?<eos> - Danny Rand.

Boy billionaire?<eos> He's a little off in the head, but he packs a mean right hook when it counts.<eos> So do you.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Now, or in general?<eos> - Both.<eos> Well, I'm alive.<eos> You?<eos> Just getting back into the world.<eos> - From where?
- Both.<eos> Well, I'm alive.<eos> You?<eos> Just getting back into the world.<eos> - From where?<eos> - Prison.<eos> Yeah, we'll... we'll talk about it later.<eos> How'd you end up here?<eos> - I'm working a case.<eos> - Yeah?
I shot him in the head.<eos> Why are you still wearing that thing?<eos> - It's...<eos> - Okay.<eos> He says we can stay.<eos> - What did you tell him?<eos> - Uh, I just gave him my black card, agreed to pay the rent for the next six months.<eos> - Hey, I'm, uh...<eos> I'm Danny.<eos> - Jessica.
- No, I can't.<eos> I'm not doing this.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> - Whatever happened back there, we did what we had to.<eos> We got out alive.<eos> The less we know about each other, the better.<eos> - This is... It's too much already.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Don't...<eos> - Jesus.
And they're global.<eos> - So what do they do?<eos> - Everything.<eos> Including the recruitment of young men in Harlem?<eos> Apparently.<eos> They're in New York for a reason, but I don't know why.<eos> - What do you mean, "fanatical ideology"?<eos> - Gonna sound crazy...<eos> - What do they want?<eos> - Immortality.
- Immortality.<eos> They want power and influence at every level across the world.<eos> And I think they want me.<eos> - For your money?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm the Immortal Iron Fist.<eos> Come again?<eos> Sworn protector of K'un-Lun.<eos> What are you on?<eos> Lithium?
Come again?<eos> Sworn protector of K'un-Lun.<eos> What are you on?<eos> Lithium?<eos> So, who was the woman with the swords?<eos> Look, I'm not sure, but I fought her in Cambodia.<eos> Yeah, and she showed up at my doorstep.<eos> She's the one that came after your client?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?
- Ms. Jones, lose my card.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> Look, I've been down this road before.<eos> - I know what we're up against.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You're the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Or Devil Boy,
I'm just stating the obvious.<eos> They saw you fight.<eos> How you're hiding your face.<eos> They're two seconds away from figuring it out themselves.<eos> - What do you want from me?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> And I want zero to do with this ancient organization.<eos> I just want to crack my case.<eos> And judging by the way you sprung into action, I think you want the same thing.<eos> Your call, Murdock.
And judging by the way you sprung into action, I think you want the same thing.<eos> Your call, Murdock.<eos> My name is Matthew.<eos> I'd erase all the marks of your past, if I could.<eos> Your life is new.<eos> But sadly, your body is not.<eos> This is how I died?<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> All that matters now is how you live.<eos> The Black Sky.
Your life is new.<eos> But sadly, your body is not.<eos> This is how I died?<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> All that matters now is how you live.<eos> The Black Sky.<eos> This is all I am?<eos> You say that like it's not enough.<eos> It is.<eos> I just...
It is.<eos> I just...<eos> You just can't help but wonder.<eos> The woman who lived in this vessel, she was lost before she came to us.<eos> She was led astray by men who were afraid of what she was, of what she was capable of doing.<eos> But destiny is a curious thing, because this vessel landed right where it belongs.<eos> With us.<eos> With me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The Black Sky.
What I'm saying is, going at them head on, that'll get you killed.<eos> Only if we do it alone.<eos> No.<eos> Look, these people took everything from me.<eos> I'm gonna take them down, one way or another.<eos> I wanted to help one kid.<eos> One family.<eos> I'm the first to admit when I'm in over my head, and this is way past my threshold.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Bulletproof.

Bulletproof.<eos> Blind ninja.<eos> - Whatever it is you are.<eos> - Classy.<eos> I tried being a one-man army, and it failed.<eos> But this...<eos> This feels like something else is at work here.<eos> The four of us show up to fight a criminal organization at the same moment?<eos> How obvious does it have to be?<eos> This...
All right? We're four very different people, and while we might all have been trying to do some good, we need to be rational about how we proceed.<eos> Oh, you gotta be kidding me.<eos> This... is one shitty excuse for a hideout.<eos> Stick.<eos> Matty.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> The guy that's gonna help you save New York.<eos> It's a bad idea to sneak up on a man holding a knife.<eos> Who says I'm sneaking?<eos> Ursus thibetanus.

Then we're not close enough.<eos> The problem with your leadership has always been your inability to get your hands dirty.<eos> In all our time together, I have never asked for your advice.<eos> And why would you?<eos> Now that you have the Black Sky by your side.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The Iron Fist was not alone.<eos> Was the Chaste not extinguished?<eos> He seems to have found some allies. Three of them.<eos> Only three?
The Iron Fist was not alone.<eos> Was the Chaste not extinguished?<eos> He seems to have found some allies. Three of them.<eos> Only three?<eos> They were rather exceptional.<eos> And so, you come to me.<eos> I come to you because it's important that we take care of this together.<eos> Have you told the others?<eos> Madame Gao and Sowande are ready and willing.<eos> And the other one?
And so, you come to me.<eos> I come to you because it's important that we take care of this together.<eos> Have you told the others?<eos> Madame Gao and Sowande are ready and willing.<eos> And the other one?<eos> On his way.<eos> I always knew we'd reunite someday.<eos> I never thought the circumstances would be this dire.<eos> That's what families do, isn't it?<eos> And what of your Black Sky?
That's what families do, isn't it?<eos> And what of your Black Sky?<eos> The thing you spent our final resources on.<eos> More powerful than you could ever imagine.<eos> Does this mean our faithful leader herself will also join the fight?<eos> As always, I do what's necessary.<eos> Then, as we used to say...<eos> "Together, we serve life itself."<eos> "Together, we serve life itself."<eos> Black Sky.
The ultimate weapon of the Hand.<eos> But after your recent failure... well, I can't help but ask myself if you are a weapon at all.<eos> Keep asking.<eos> Does that man have one hand?<eos> - How did you find us, Stick?<eos> - You know this guy?<eos> - It's complicated.<eos> - Then uncomplicate it.<eos> - He's one of them, aren't you?<eos> - The Hand?
How come no one told me?<eos> There are things I don't know.<eos> Why are you here, Stick?<eos> Because this one, the Immortal Iron Fist, living weapon and protector of the ancient city,<eos> is still a thundering dumbass. Shit like that... will get you killed.<eos> I tried to call Colleen.<eos> I told her where I was.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Safer than we are.<eos> Small mistakes.

- Hey, we are all in danger.<eos> I don't know you very well, Mr. Cage, you seem like a good guy, so trust me when I tell you that with this old man, nothing is sacred.<eos> Kid, it's not just one of us this time.<eos> It's the whole goddamn city we're talking about.<eos> We're talking about their lives, Stick.<eos> We're talking about the lives of their loved ones.<eos> - Wait, um, what?<eos> - Those tremors that shook up the place, they're nothing compared to what comes next.<eos> The Hand's done it before.<eos> Pompeii, Chernobyl.
Events the history books like to call catastrophes, just cover-ups.<eos> 'Cause New York is next.<eos> And the only thing keeping Manhattan from crumbling to a pile of dust... is the four of you.<eos> All right, I am done with this tin-foil-hat shit.<eos> - Whoa, where are you going?<eos> - I tried to hang in, guys.<eos> I really did.<eos> But whatever this guy's selling, I ain't buying.<eos> Sit down and shut up.<eos> - Jessica.
I really did.<eos> But whatever this guy's selling, I ain't buying.<eos> Sit down and shut up.<eos> - Jessica.<eos> - It's not gonna work.<eos> I know parts of this sound crazy.<eos> Parts of it?<eos> Throw out all this mystical, ancient conspiracy stuff, and you're still left with one hard fact.<eos> People are gonna get hurt.<eos> - Not you.
Give me a break.<eos> Hey, these abilities that you have such contempt for... they might do some good right now.<eos> This war, or whatever it is, this is not my problem.<eos> I just want to get answers for my client.<eos> I want answers, too.<eos> And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.<eos> I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me.<eos> It was good to see you.<eos> Let me know when they fit you for a costume.<eos> Jessica.
We are not talking about this, all right?<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> But I think you two have got a lot to learn from each other.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - I'm done taking lessons, Stick.<eos> Lessons ain't done with you.<eos> This isn't her fight.<eos> Sooner or later, it's gonna be everybody's fight.<eos> Not if I can help it.<eos> Me neither.
She helped set up my parents' murder.<eos> She set up a lot of murders.<eos> Then there's Sowande, African warlord, gunrunner, you name it.<eos> - The one I followed.<eos> - Don't follow too closely.<eos> Couple of moves, he'll slow your pulse till your heart fails.<eos> Then there's Bakuto.<eos> He's dead.<eos> At least the last time I saw him.<eos> Finally, some good news.
- You calm down, Luke.<eos> You don't get second chances with these people, all right?<eos> If you're not careful, the next thing you know, you're dead.<eos> Or worse, you're holding the people you love the most in the world and...<eos> You get the privilege of watching them die.<eos> All right, maybe this city is at stake.<eos> Maybe this fight is important.<eos> I get that.<eos> I'm just saying, imagine knowing for the rest of your life, you only made it worse by getting involved.<eos> Jesus.

- Hey.<eos> - What time is it?<eos> Late.<eos> Or early.<eos> Depending on your life choices.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> How you holding up?<eos> Fine.<eos> I mean... as well as we can be.<eos> And your daughter?
How you holding up?<eos> Fine.<eos> I mean... as well as we can be.<eos> And your daughter?<eos> She's asleep.<eos> - Are you drunk?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean... it doesn't matter.<eos> - You wanna come inside?<eos> - No, I just...
- Are you drunk?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean... it doesn't matter.<eos> - You wanna come inside?<eos> - No, I just...<eos> I just wanted to say, you might be right.<eos> So whatever your husband got into, it just keeps getting weirder and weirder.<eos> - What do you know?<eos> - I can't say, but I'm gonna work on getting you guys some protection.<eos> - Like, around-the-clock surveillance.
So whatever your husband got into, it just keeps getting weirder and weirder.<eos> - What do you know?<eos> - I can't say, but I'm gonna work on getting you guys some protection.<eos> - Like, around-the-clock surveillance.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Uh! Please don't ask.<eos> - No, I just mean...<eos> I thought you already did that.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - The car.
- Stay here.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Who's in that car?<eos> Stay away from the windows.<eos> Do you hear me? Go.<eos> Be with your daughter.<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> How are you still hungry?<eos> It takes a lot of energy to summon my chi.<eos> What?
What?<eos> Come on, you've seen it in action.<eos> Twice now.<eos> I liked it better on my side of the fight and not the side of my face.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Don't get too used to it.<eos> What?<eos> - We make quite a team.<eos> - Oh, let's not use that word.<eos> What word?
- Oh, let's not use that word.<eos> What word?<eos> Look, I'm not looking for super friends.<eos> Yeah, you keep on telling yourself that.<eos> You came to Midland Circle for a reason.<eos> I came to help Harlem.<eos> Not you.<eos> Come on.<eos> I didn't need help.<eos> You serious?
You came to Midland Circle for a reason.<eos> I came to help Harlem.<eos> Not you.<eos> Come on.<eos> I didn't need help.<eos> You serious?<eos> Look, all I'm saying is, like it or not... we're walking the same path.<eos> We fix this thing together.<eos> Then that path comes to an end.<eos> Last one?
You serious?<eos> Look, all I'm saying is, like it or not... we're walking the same path.<eos> We fix this thing together.<eos> Then that path comes to an end.<eos> Last one?<eos> I'm glad you found others.<eos> Don't act like this is normal.<eos> Don't act like I don't know what's really going on with you.<eos> You crossed paths with her, too?<eos> With who?

I'm no black belt.<eos> You let me know when that hurts.<eos> Stay back there.<eos> Lock the door.<eos> You think it's them?<eos> It's hard to tell.<eos> How'd they find us?<eos> It was a matter of time.<eos> Who's inside?<eos> Weapons.
They will disappoint you.<eos> They haven't yet.<eos> They will not make you stronger.<eos> And if I might give you some advice, the more connections you have, the easier it will be to break you.<eos> What do you want to do with him?<eos> Well, I can't disclose that.<eos> But I'll tell you what I'm willing to do for him.<eos> I'll assemble all the resources my organization has to offer.<eos> You remember the last time all the fingers of the Hand came together, don't you, Stick?<eos> - A goddamn culling. - Hmm.
- She's annoying.<eos> - Tell me about it.<eos> Where's Alexandra?<eos> Get down!<eos> Dude, get off me.<eos> Now it's a goddamn party.<eos> - Who are these people?<eos> - They want Danny.<eos> We want him alive.<eos> Oh, shit.
Wait, I just wanna talk to you.<eos> - Where's Matt?<eos> What's he thinking?<eos> - He's not. Stay with me!<eos> This is not who you are.<eos> I know you.<eos> You died.<eos> I held you in my arms.<eos> I buried you, Elektra!<eos> Elektra.
What's he thinking?<eos> - He's not. Stay with me!<eos> This is not who you are.<eos> I know you.<eos> You died.<eos> I held you in my arms.<eos> I buried you, Elektra!<eos> Elektra.<eos> That's your name.<eos> Elektra.
I buried you, Elektra!<eos> Elektra.<eos> That's your name.<eos> Elektra.<eos> What have they done to you?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I can help you, Elektra!<eos> They say you can't be broken.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Luke!
- More comin'.<eos> - Not for long.<eos> Hey! Let's go.<eos> Get over here, guys!<eos> Smells like shit.<eos> It's our only way out.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> And where's the Black Sky?<eos> That's a question for our leader.<eos> Danny!
Smells like shit.<eos> It's our only way out.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> And where's the Black Sky?<eos> That's a question for our leader.<eos> Danny!<eos> - Man, am I glad to see you.<eos> - Where've you been?<eos> I'll explain everything, but first... we have company.<eos> Company? Hey! Whoa!
- Where've you been?<eos> I'll explain everything, but first... we have company.<eos> Company? Hey! Whoa!<eos> I said I'd bring him back.<eos> What happened?<eos> The Hand attacked us.<eos> They took Luke.<eos> How do you know they didn't follow you here?<eos> We're clear.<eos> - What?
- No place we land will stay safe for long.<eos> - We can't keep running forever.<eos> - I'm not running, period.<eos> My company owns a building not far from here.<eos> We don't need another hideout.<eos> We just need for this to be over.<eos> - You're oversimplifying it.<eos> - Oh, am I?<eos> Or am I the only one of us who isn't in this for a cheap thrill?<eos> - Jessica.
We don't need another hideout.<eos> We just need for this to be over.<eos> - You're oversimplifying it.<eos> - Oh, am I?<eos> Or am I the only one of us who isn't in this for a cheap thrill?<eos> - Jessica.<eos> - And the last time we did have a plan, but this one left us to go fight that chick in the spandex.<eos> Yeah. Just like he did in Midland Circle.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Luke?
I'm grateful for you.<eos> You had no choice in returning from death.<eos> I realize that.<eos> But I hope you understand that this is the life you were chosen to lead, as a weapon against our enemies.<eos> If you do not fulfill that role... you're of no use to the Hand.<eos> Or to me.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I have news.<eos> Sowande has been taken.<eos> By whom?
The same way the unbreakable one let that boy die in a jail cell.<eos> Afraid and alone.<eos> The same way the woman couldn't save the architect.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Have I gotten in your head the same way he did long ago?<eos> What about the ones you still love?<eos> What will become of them once you are gone?<eos> - Who else must die because of you?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> The nurse.
To be honest, I don't think he knows, either.<eos> Then why are you listening to him?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why are you listening to any of them, Danny?<eos> When I said that we should find others, I did not mean...<eos> This is not their fight, it's ours, and keeping them around is a liability.<eos> You haven't really seen what they can do.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> Quick.<eos> Hello, Colleen.

She's an old friend.<eos> We are far from friends.<eos> I wouldn't say that.<eos> When you're done with that, I'd like to talk.<eos> There's nothing left to talk about.<eos> It feels as if fate has brought us back together, doesn't it?<eos> What do you want with Danny?<eos> They sent me for him, yes.<eos> But I came for you.<eos> Bullshit.
That dude was for sure dead last time we saw him, right?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Okay, just checking.<eos> Remember the last time we faced off, Bakuto?<eos> I do, Mr. Rand.<eos> And I look forward to doing it again.<eos> You really shouldn't.<eos> I heard you'd made some friends.<eos> Smart move, considering she never believed in her purpose, and you've yet to discover yours.<eos> Soon, Iron Fist.

I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.<eos> I'm gonna need a little more than that.<eos> It's the Hand.<eos> They came for you before, Karen.<eos> I can't let that happen again.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> - I know.<eos> They're back in New York, and I...<eos> - No, no, it's not them.<eos> You.
This is how you tell me that you're doing it again?<eos> 'Cause that's what you're saying.<eos> You're going out as him.<eos> Uh, no, actually.<eos> Uh, well... not yet.<eos> All right, but you told me you didn't miss it...<eos> I know what I said.<eos> We don't have to have this conversation.<eos> Just talk to me.<eos> Please, Matt.
That's all I'm asking.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, well, don't.<eos> I'm not doing this for you.<eos> It's just... self-preservation at this point.<eos> You deserve better, Karen.<eos> So do you.<eos> - Misty.
I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, well, don't.<eos> I'm not doing this for you.<eos> It's just... self-preservation at this point.<eos> You deserve better, Karen.<eos> So do you.<eos> - Misty.<eos> - Luke.
Then I don't know how I can help you.<eos> You got a chair?<eos> What the hell?<eos> We've got more coming.<eos> Please.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was wondering when I'd see you again.<eos> Me, too.
We've got more coming.<eos> Please.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was wondering when I'd see you again.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Guess it won't be today.<eos> That army you used to fight alongside...<eos> The Chaste.
The place you can't live without.<eos> The place that made you what you really are.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Don't...<eos> You don't get to tell me who I am, all right?<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> I guess what I'm saying is I see a future for Trish Talk that dives into some more investigative reporting.<eos> This tremor stuff, for example, I don't know if you guys know,<eos> - but a lot of our listeners are having a...<eos> - Trish.

Jess?<eos> - I need her for a minute.<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on, we gotta go.<eos> Meeting's over.<eos> - Excuse me for one second.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - No.<eos> You know that case I took?<eos> The architect?
- I need her for a minute.<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on, we gotta go.<eos> Meeting's over.<eos> - Excuse me for one second.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - No.<eos> You know that case I took?<eos> The architect?<eos> The C-4?
You know that case I took?<eos> The architect?<eos> The C-4?<eos> Well, it went south fast, and you may be in danger.<eos> Me? It doesn't matter.<eos> I can't just leave those people.<eos> They are safer far away from us.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I know it's annoying, but I gotta get you to a safe place fast.<eos> Shit.

I know it's annoying, but I gotta get you to a safe place fast.<eos> Shit.<eos> Stairwell.<eos> Go.<eos> Jesus!<eos> I didn't mean you should go... Jess! Jess!<eos> That hurt so much.<eos> No way.<eos> The scarf looked better.<eos> - Nice ears.
I can't believe I'm admitting this, but... all I want... is something stable.<eos> Something I can hold on to.<eos> Funny you should say that.<eos> Because I know you.<eos> I know Danny.<eos> I know this fight with the Hand.<eos> And where I'm standing... you are the foundation.<eos> So how are you holding up?<eos> Did you know Jessica knows Daredevil?<eos> - What?
Did you know Jessica knows Daredevil?<eos> - What?<eos> The costume guy?<eos> - Yeah. And some guy attacked us.<eos> I think it's connected to the tremors.<eos> - I mean, it has to be, right? - Ugh.<eos> Yeah, um, maybe.<eos> Do you want one?<eos> - Uh, I'm... I'm okay.<eos> - Smart.
The costume guy?<eos> - Yeah. And some guy attacked us.<eos> I think it's connected to the tremors.<eos> - I mean, it has to be, right? - Ugh.<eos> Yeah, um, maybe.<eos> Do you want one?<eos> - Uh, I'm... I'm okay.<eos> - Smart.<eos> Who's she?<eos> Reporter.
- I mean, it has to be, right? - Ugh.<eos> Yeah, um, maybe.<eos> Do you want one?<eos> - Uh, I'm... I'm okay.<eos> - Smart.<eos> Who's she?<eos> Reporter.<eos> Think she's here to write a story?<eos> Doesn't look like it.<eos> You, too?
I'm glad to see you.<eos> Gotta be honest, I'm glad to have a break from depositions.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What's the story?<eos> Matt didn't tell you?<eos> Matt doesn't tell me anything.<eos> It's happening again.<eos> I know.<eos> I tried to steer him away.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Funny.<eos> If I didn't know any better, I'd think he's trying to tell us something.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right, listen up, everybody.<eos> I know you don't wanna be here, but it seems that you are all of interest to some pretty powerful and dangerous people.<eos> Now, to protect you, I need your cooperation.<eos> Sit tight for now.<eos> We'll have more answers soon.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> Colleen Wing?
What can you tell me about these people that you're fighting?<eos> Nothing.<eos> The more I tell you, the more danger I put you in.<eos> I'm getting pretty sick of people telling me that.<eos> It's true.<eos> Why else would we be here?<eos> I'm here 'cause I'm a cop.<eos> Trust me, they don't give a shit.<eos> Just in case.<eos> Thanks.
Or you are not as committed.<eos> Your judgment has always been clouded when it comes to your old disciples.<eos> Just because I don't blind my disciples, doesn't mean I'm made weak by them.<eos> - It's good to see you.<eos> - Save it. - We have a situation.<eos> - We know, and we plan to correct it.<eos> We will discuss your failure to acquire a few bargaining chips next.<eos> But first...<eos> The Iron Fist has a new partner in his fight.<eos> Daredevil.

Then she will be destroyed.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> Hey, stop.<eos> You can't undo this.<eos> Admit it.<eos> - Elektra's still in there.<eos> You failed.<eos> - You're the one who failed.<eos> Elektra died on a rooftop in your arms because you couldn't protect her.<eos> Shit.
Sowande is gone.<eos> - He will return.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> For the first time, death is a possibility.<eos> Even if he doesn't, we will survive.<eos> Except the Black Sky... almost killed me.<eos> Then there would be three.<eos> Perhaps this is what we needed.<eos> A reminder that everyone in this room is expendable.<eos> Everyone.
- Now he thinks he can save her.<eos> - That's why you nearly got us killed?<eos> When I said her name, she recognized it.<eos> She knew me.<eos> I think whatever they did when they resurrected her, I think I can get through to her.<eos> Okay, to be clear, we've now used the word "resurrected" three times.<eos> It's what they do.<eos> We agreed to put everything on the table, Matt.<eos> If we're gonna defeat the Hand, we gotta take her out.<eos> No, Stick.
If Alexandra gets a hold of you, the war's lost.<eos> I can't allow that.<eos> Listen, Stick, maybe we should just... uh, let him lay low, or just...<eos> Maybe we should just hide him.<eos> We're running out of time!<eos> They're hunting our friends, our families, and they're not gonna stop there.<eos> You heard what he said.<eos> This ends with New York in ruins.<eos> They want me on the sidelines 'cause I'm the only one who can destroy them.<eos> Jess?
You heard what he said.<eos> This ends with New York in ruins.<eos> They want me on the sidelines 'cause I'm the only one who can destroy them.<eos> Jess?<eos> How do you suggest we hide him?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll go back to doing this without you if I have to.<eos> I've already lost one city.<eos> I'm not losing another.<eos> Me neither.
Fine.<eos> I'll go back to doing this without you if I have to.<eos> I've already lost one city.<eos> I'm not losing another.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna try and keep me here against my will?<eos> I hear what you're saying, Danny, but...<eos> And no one loves this city more than I do, but you can't leave this room.<eos> Whatever.
You just stay here.<eos> We can keep you safe, all right?<eos> You just need to calm down.<eos> Well, that's the problem, Matt.<eos> I'm all out of calm.<eos> Hey! Enough.<eos> Don't make me use this.<eos> Sorry about this.<eos> Nice way to spend your time fresh out of prison.<eos> Yeah.
Uh, there was a hole there.<eos> Hundreds of feet deep.<eos> In the middle of New York?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And you're just now remembering this?<eos> You sense anything at the bottom of that hole?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I kept tabs on it.<eos> Once the building was finished, my sense was the hole was gone.<eos> - You sure?
I don't think so.<eos> I kept tabs on it.<eos> Once the building was finished, my sense was the hole was gone.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - I'm not sure of anything anymore.<eos> You didn't answer her question.<eos> How come we are now just hearing about this?<eos> - It wasn't important, Luke.<eos> - Try again.<eos> What?
You're not exactly an open book yourself, Jessica.<eos> - What is that supposed to mean?<eos> - Well, no one's digging into your past.<eos> My past is none of your goddamn business, and it's not actively trying to kill us.<eos> - Clock is ticking.<eos> - So if we need more answers, going back to Midland Circle is the only play.<eos> We barely made it out last time, and they're gonna be waiting for us.<eos> - Yeah, she's right.<eos> - So how do we find whatever he opens?<eos> The architect?
- Yeah, she's right.<eos> - So how do we find whatever he opens?<eos> The architect?<eos> My client's husband.<eos> The one your girlfriend tried to kill.<eos> He designed the place.<eos> What, you think he knows how Danny ties into this?<eos> It's worth a shot.<eos> Well, I guess you two better get going.<eos> What about you?
- Well, Danny's still knocked out.<eos> - Good.<eos> You know, after years of tracking these assholes, you hear about all the shit they've done.<eos> And even after you take 'em off the count and they're dead... it's still enough to keep you up at night.<eos> Where'd you find this piece of shit?<eos> Warehouse on 151st and Amsterdam.<eos> He was hiring kids out of Harlem.<eos> Using them as a cleanup crew.<eos> Destroying bodies at an abandoned warehouse in Chinatown.<eos> Our headquarters.
I am not so sure anymore.<eos> We must honor Sowande by continuing to fight for what he lost.<eos> Life itself.<eos> Our leader has brought us this far.<eos> And I for one will continue to follow her, until we have the Iron Fist. Until we get what we need from New York.<eos> I think it's up here.<eos> - You think?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> All these brownstones look the same, don't they?<eos> Oh, shit.
He was desperate.<eos> He started stockpiling explosives.<eos> And you think his target was Midland Circle?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Actually, I think this is it.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Ninety-nine percent.<eos> Ninety-two percent.<eos> But that's still a lot.<eos> - Lexi, right?
In all the time we've known each other, I've never seen you like this.<eos> Your position is one of great power.<eos> But it is a burden as much as a blessing.<eos> Which is why I've convinced the others to follow your lead.<eos> You and I have always understood each other.<eos> Under a single condition.<eos> We will seek out and capture the Iron Fist ourselves without the Black Sky.<eos> It's not like you to show such a lack of faith.<eos> And it's not like you, Alexandra, to show such...<eos> Weakness?
You were right.<eos> I'll be right here when you're done.<eos> You've got me tied up like a prisoner.<eos> Not "like." You're definitely a prisoner.<eos> It's not a good look.<eos> Where's Matt?<eos> Where's Jessica?<eos> They're digging up info on Midland Circle.<eos> We think that's where it all started.<eos> "We"?
Look.<eos> If you'd listened instead of fighting us, you would've been around for the conversation.<eos> And I think you would've agreed.<eos> Midland Circle's suspect.<eos> Especially now that we found the hole.<eos> What hole?<eos> Murdock thinks there's something weird about Midland Circle.<eos> And they got you on guard duty.<eos> Nah, that depends on you.<eos> Big mistake.
Locking me up is not smart.<eos> Neither is fighting three people that happen to be on your side.<eos> The moment I can refocus my chi, I'm getting out of this chair.<eos> I'll be waiting.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Meditating.<eos> I think.<eos> He said something about crane pose and centering his animal.<eos> Then I tuned him out.<eos> Anima.
It's not "mystic stuff."<eos> It's just a different way of viewing the world.<eos> - Quite different.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's about perspective.<eos> Hey, why don't you tell me again about how you punched the dragon and got your magic hand?<eos> During the final trial of Shou-Lao the Undying,<eos> - I plunged my fist into his molten heart.<eos> - Dude, I was kidding.<eos> Molten heart, huh?
During the final trial of Shou-Lao the Undying,<eos> - I plunged my fist into his molten heart.<eos> - Dude, I was kidding.<eos> Molten heart, huh?<eos> I bet that must've hurt.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like you wouldn't believe.<eos> I took a direct hit from a rocket launcher once.<eos> Got blasted in the face with a shotgun.<eos> By Jessica.

Not like he used to.<eos> He didn't do anything like he used to.<eos> I missed him.<eos> Long before my mom came to you.<eos> Long before he died.<eos> - Do you play?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - The piano.<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> You?
- Just...<eos> Do you mind?<eos> - Oh, it's straight ahead.<eos> - Here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, I wasn't very good, but...<eos> - Come on, we should go.<eos> - Just give me a second here.<eos> - You hear that? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> D-sharp.
The hammer's ruffling something before it hits the string here. Here.<eos> Whoa, what are those?<eos> Looks like the plans to the building your dad was working on.<eos> In the piano?<eos> He didn't want them to get into the wrong hands.<eos> And yours... the right ones?<eos> Lexi, I promise, whatever your dad was doing, we're on your side now.<eos> But we're gonna need a minute here, okay?<eos> He was gonna blow it up for sure.<eos> - Oh, shit.

Ten years.<eos> That was a lot of fun, being blind on the inside.<eos> Then I met these people who taught me how to fight for real.<eos> Taught me how the world works for real.<eos> When I got out, I had purpose.<eos> These people, these the ones you call the Chaste?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Closest I ever had to family.<eos> Aside from Matty.<eos> And Elektra.

Closest I ever had to family.<eos> Aside from Matty.<eos> And Elektra.<eos> - Sorry for your loss.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> It's nothin' compared to what comes next.<eos> What's with the incense?<eos> Mmm... Helps me meditate.<eos> Ask for guidance.<eos> Forgiveness.
And whatever it is, it's bad enough that he dies trying to blow it up.<eos> Right, he wanted to destroy it.<eos> But he didn't want to blow it up.<eos> I think he wanted to collapse it down.<eos> Are you sure the structure in the hole is man-made?<eos> Could it be some sort of bedrock?<eos> Thirty stories deep, in a perfect dome?<eos> All right.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Jessica?
Could it be some sort of bedrock?<eos> Thirty stories deep, in a perfect dome?<eos> All right.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Jessica?<eos> How'd you know?<eos> About what?<eos> About my dad.<eos> A crime-fighting blind lawyer, I figured there had gotta be a good story there.<eos> Or a shitty one.
Yeah, don't get used to it.<eos> So much smoke.<eos> What is this stuff?<eos> Eh, little of this, little of that.<eos> Kid was right.<eos> This is war.<eos> And they need him to win it.<eos> We assumed we only had two choices.<eos> Run or fight.<eos> Well...
Eh, little of this, little of that.<eos> Kid was right.<eos> This is war.<eos> And they need him to win it.<eos> We assumed we only had two choices.<eos> Run or fight.<eos> Well...<eos> I found a third option.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> Luke! Luke!
- You served K'un-Lun as well as you could.<eos> With any luck, you'll see it again.<eos> I would imagine it's beautiful.<eos> Stick... you need to listen to me.<eos> I wish there was another way, kid.<eos> But there are things in this world far worse than me.<eos> Stick!<eos> - You can't have him, girl.<eos> - You no longer get to tell me what to do.<eos> Elektra!

Your own strength was always your singular focus.<eos> It's gotten me this far.<eos> I'm still waiting for my apology.<eos> I assume you've spoken to Gao.<eos> I have.<eos> Regardless of what has come before, we were meant to fight this war together.<eos> Of course.<eos> Which is why... I wanted your last meal to be a good one.<eos> You came alone... to face me?<eos> Foolish.

I wanted your last meal to be a good one.<eos> You came alone... to face me?<eos> Foolish.<eos> But then you always were... a lone wolf.<eos> An interesting metaphor.
And the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, whoever he is.<eos> I'm so happy you're all on board with the plan.<eos> But let me remind you, I neutralized our enemies.<eos> I brought you the Iron Fist.<eos> I was able to keep the most important operation in our history running while you succumbed to chaos and conflict.<eos> I have proven myself to be the one and only true leader...<eos> His name is Matthew.<eos> And my name... is Elektra Natchios.<eos> You work for me now.<eos> Any questions?
You're alone.<eos> Wanna tell me why?<eos> He's not ready.<eos> The Chaste needs Matt Murdock.<eos> I've tried... but I couldn't convince him.<eos> Bullshit.
- Looks like it.<eos> Listen, I need you to realize we are on the same side.<eos> Now, I held up my end of the bargain.<eos> I protected your friends.<eos> It's about damn time you dealt me in.<eos> There's a weird shadow organization.<eos> I've been tracking them.<eos> Not very well.<eos> How many were there?<eos> Just one.
There's a weird shadow organization.<eos> I've been tracking them.<eos> Not very well.<eos> How many were there?<eos> Just one.<eos> The same one that came after John Raymond.<eos> What kind of person knocks out you and Luke Cage?<eos> I'm not sure you'd believe me even if I told you.<eos> Try me.<eos> - Whoa, Matt.

- Right.<eos> Claire gave you a quick look.<eos> Nothing's broken.<eos> But the cops have a lot of questions.<eos> - I wasn't wearing the suit.<eos> - I know.<eos> There is a God after all.<eos> Oh, God, I need to go.<eos> He's in danger.<eos> - Who?

There is a God after all.<eos> Oh, God, I need to go.<eos> He's in danger.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Danny Rand.<eos> Uh, they took him.<eos> - The billionaire?<eos> - Stick.<eos> She killed Stick.<eos> Yeah, Danny.
They took Danny.<eos> And then now, I have to save him from the Hand.<eos> You are in no position to save anybody.<eos> They haven't pressed charges, but they found you with two dead bodies.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> He's the Iron Fist.<eos> I'm not gonna pretend to know what that means.<eos> Foggy, the person who did this, who, uh, who took Danny...<eos> It's Elektra.<eos> - Your ex-girlfriend?
- She's not.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> The Hand took her.<eos> They did something to her.<eos> - Whatever she is, she's not herself.<eos> - Matt, you need to take a breath.<eos> - You sound insane.<eos> - I don't care if you believe me.<eos> Whatever they're gonna do with Danny Rand, it is not good for anyone.<eos> - Mr. Murdock. - Yes.
Is that you, Detective?<eos> You're up.<eos> I've got one of your clients scared shitless across the hallway, and the other one passed out, so I'm gonna need for you to answer a few questions.<eos> Oh, well, unfortunately, whatever happened is protected by attorney-client privilege.<eos> That's cute, but cut the shit.<eos> 'Cause we both know you're not just a lawyer in all this.<eos> You're something more.<eos> As of right now, you're a person of interest.<eos> A witness to a crime.<eos> A witness?
That's cute, but cut the shit.<eos> 'Cause we both know you're not just a lawyer in all this.<eos> You're something more.<eos> As of right now, you're a person of interest.<eos> A witness to a crime.<eos> A witness?<eos> What, do you want me to describe how it sounded, Detective?<eos> Perhaps you didn't hear me when I said, "Cut the shit."<eos> Now I hear they took Danny Rand.<eos> A person with that high of a profile?
If this falls back on you... it's gonna make your life miserable.<eos> Look, uh... I wanna help.<eos> I can't say much, apart from the fact that he is in way over his head.<eos> And we need to help him.<eos> Mr. Murdock, all due respect, you need to start worrying about helping yourself.<eos> His pulse is up a little.<eos> Is that good?<eos> Long as it doesn't spike irregularly, sure.<eos> What do you think it was?<eos> Some kinda drug.
With them?<eos> I did everything I could to avoid people with abilities.<eos> Quit my job.<eos> Moved my ass uptown.<eos> - And how'd that work out?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> Is sidekick a good look on me?<eos> They are fighting a good fight.<eos> You're doing it, too.<eos> Not like them.

You're doing it, too.<eos> Not like them.<eos> And even Jessica.<eos> There are people who run from the fire, and there are people who run into it.<eos> Dumb people.<eos> Okay, you said I was the foundation, right?<eos> Look in the mirror.<eos> Even before you met Luke, you weren't the type who could just... stand by and watch.<eos> Were you?<eos> Claire?

It is now.<eos> Black Sky or not, there are three of us and one of you.<eos> Is that a challenge?<eos> We will do what is needed to preserve our organization.<eos> This is not our first coup.<eos> It is your first without the substance.<eos> Is that a gamble you're willing to take?<eos> The Hand is a global organization.<eos> For years, Alexandra fostered relationships with everything from crime lords to corporate partners.<eos> Corporate partners?

Living underground. In hiding.<eos> You know nothing of power.<eos> You didn't exist until Alexandra gave you life.<eos> Didn't I?<eos> It's not what you did, it's how you did it.<eos> The Hand has survived this long because we, above all else, have been astute.<eos> Oh. Well, this may come as a bit of a shock, but I don't care about the Hand.<eos> I care about the substance.<eos> Because from now on, nothing will stand in my way.<eos> Not even death.
They've been after him for a while now.<eos> Who knows what they'll do next.<eos> Look, when criminals feel like they're winning, they get sloppy.<eos> This could be good for us.<eos> No, not these criminals.<eos> They don't get sloppy.<eos> They just get more dangerous.<eos> It has to be us.<eos> We can take care of this.<eos> "We"?
Oh, you can do that... after I book them for obstruction.<eos> And you.<eos> Just a word.<eos> In private.<eos> I would like to explain to them how best to cooperate in building your case.<eos> Well, I hope they like what you have to say.<eos> Otherwise, and I warn you, I'm putting you in a room with two super-powered people.<eos> Last I heard, they still have legal rights.<eos> - You know what, son...<eos> - Captain...
- Which is what?<eos> - We still don't know.<eos> Where did they take Danny?<eos> Midland Circle makes the most sense.<eos> What from the architect?<eos> He was planning on blowing up the building.<eos> Collapsing it straight down into the hole.<eos> - They're still digging?<eos> We found blueprints inside the piano.<eos> - The what?
- Don't ask.<eos> If they think Danny's a key, maybe whatever it is he unlocks is in that structure.<eos> Oh, my God, this is the dumbest...<eos> The question is, what are we gonna do about it?<eos> I mean, I just got out of jail.<eos> They don't know who you are, Matt.<eos> - Jesus!<eos> Give us a minute!<eos> - It's not the cops.<eos> - Hey.
Here's my official legal advice.<eos> You need to get something out of those three.<eos> Luke and Jessica think they're protecting us.<eos> And the lawyer, God knows what his play is.<eos> I don't care.<eos> This is the kinda case that makes or breaks a career.<eos> And I'm not talking about mine.<eos> Now, you track down and stop this organization, whoever they are, and brass will be knocking each other over trying to shake your hand.<eos> But you don't break this case, they'll remember that, too.<eos> Shit!
A lot they didn't tell me.<eos> Besides, even if I could read it...<eos> I have no idea what this is.<eos> Well, lucky for us, I do.<eos> Years ago, someone like you used their abilities to seal this.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Alexandra talked.<eos> I listened.<eos> In doing so, they guaranteed that only one thing could open it.<eos> Another Iron Fist.
I also had masters.<eos> But I'm free now.<eos> And you can be as well.<eos> I want three units scouring a ten-block radius.<eos> They can't be far.<eos> And, Detective... I thought Luke was smarter than this.<eos> I thought...<eos> If you want a chance to save yourself here, you need to reconsider how well you know these vigilantes. That clear?<eos> Find them.<eos> Shit.
Find them.<eos> Shit.<eos> They got an APB out on us.<eos> They think you guys kidnapped me.<eos> Great.<eos> We're still 20 blocks away.<eos> We need to stay off the streets.<eos> Should we take a cab?<eos> - They kept my wallet.<eos> - Yeah, me, too.

I'm just trying to help.<eos> Harlem can't afford to lose him.<eos> You know, on his first day out of lockup, you took him on a walk... and told him that he was capable of turning this city around.<eos> Of saving somebody.<eos> That's exactly what he's trying to do right now.<eos> It may not be convenient for you or the NYPD.<eos> It's really not convenient for me.<eos> But we're damn lucky he's the kind of man that doesn't let anything stand in his way.<eos> Wait a minute, where's the chick with the sword?<eos> Oh, shit.
It's really not convenient for me.<eos> But we're damn lucky he's the kind of man that doesn't let anything stand in his way.<eos> Wait a minute, where's the chick with the sword?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> We have time to grab a drink?<eos> Or three?<eos> - Having second thoughts?<eos> - No.<eos> Maybe.<eos> You?
We have time to grab a drink?<eos> Or three?<eos> - Having second thoughts?<eos> - No.<eos> Maybe.<eos> You?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe.<eos> - So how do we get in? - Back entrance.<eos> Parking garage.
A couple days?<eos> God, that feels like three weeks ago.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> There it is again.<eos> All right.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - We're not alone.<eos> MJ deep cut.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Three.
Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> There it is again.<eos> All right.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - We're not alone.<eos> MJ deep cut.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Three.<eos> Armed.<eos> - Just three?
There it is again.<eos> All right.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - We're not alone.<eos> MJ deep cut.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Three.<eos> Armed.<eos> - Just three?<eos> - Not just any three.
Both of us.<eos> We've been raised to fight someone else's war.<eos> But you and I, we're the same.<eos> All we want to decide is our own futures.<eos> You sound like your master, Alexandra.<eos> But neither of you know what I want.<eos> Alexandra's dead.<eos> I killed her.<eos> That's what I wanted.<eos> And you?
Especially since you know that your precious elders chose to keep you in the dark.<eos> Just like mine did.<eos> The only difference between us is that I took my destiny.<eos> You ran away from yours.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe I did run.<eos> Maybe there were things in this world that I wasn't ready to confront.<eos> But you... you are not one of them.<eos> I should warn you, I'm stronger than I look.<eos> What the...

They gone, Matt?<eos> Yeah, for now.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> I'm here to save Danny and make sure no one gets hurt ever again.<eos> - How does that answer my question?<eos> - We have to go.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> She's right.<eos> Hold it.<eos> - Claire?
- What happened here?<eos> No time to explain.<eos> - Like hell there isn't.<eos> - Please.<eos> You got a minute before the full force of the NYPD is here.<eos> So I need you to answer this fast.<eos> How long you want me to stall 'em?<eos> That can't be good.<eos> Nope.<eos> Hey.
- Like hell there isn't.<eos> - Please.<eos> You got a minute before the full force of the NYPD is here.<eos> So I need you to answer this fast.<eos> How long you want me to stall 'em?<eos> That can't be good.<eos> Nope.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, it's Karen.<eos> Yeah, our lights, too.
That can't be good.<eos> Nope.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, it's Karen.<eos> Yeah, our lights, too.<eos> Keep moving.<eos> Cops coming.<eos> - Wow. - You have no idea.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Shit.
Freeze!<eos> Shit.<eos> - Hold your fire.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Knight, where have you been?<eos> I had a feeling they were here, Captain, so I came down.<eos> - Well, are they?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But by the time I got here, lights went out, they were gone.<eos> Hey, Cap!
- Hold your fire.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Knight, where have you been?<eos> I had a feeling they were here, Captain, so I came down.<eos> - Well, are they?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But by the time I got here, lights went out, they were gone.<eos> Hey, Cap!<eos> We got movement in the stairwell.<eos> Shit.
They will come back.<eos> Again and again.<eos> But these could end them forever.<eos> I get that you have a history with these people.<eos> So do you.<eos> So does she.<eos> And so did that kid from Harlem.<eos> Detonating a bomb here won't fix what happened to him.<eos> Okay?<eos> Not by a long shot.

...we all know what the Hand is capable of.<eos> We've all been affected.<eos> But they keep coming back.<eos> And when they do, it's not just crime, it's horror movie... murdery shit.<eos> If we don't do this, it's gonna get worse.<eos> Take down the building or the Hand takes down New York.<eos> This is not how I fix things.<eos> These people have come after our friends.<eos> They're showing no signs of stopping.<eos> Jess!
Jess!<eos> You know that I've wanted nothing to do with this from the beginning.<eos> The architect's brains are still in my apartment.<eos> I haven't changed my clothes.<eos> Let's just get this shit over with.<eos> We'll all sleep easier once they're gone.<eos> We can all just... get on with our lives.<eos> If we do this... no one but those...<eos> Okay?<eos> Not one single innocent person.
- Exactly.<eos> I'm saying, as your friend, if I'm going to do this, I need your help a lot more than they do.<eos> - Promise me that you won't fail him again.<eos> - I'll make it right.<eos> I owe him that much.<eos> This way.<eos> I'll be back, Claire.<eos> I promise.<eos> As far as we can tell, the building itself is on some type of hi-tech lockdown.<eos> Bulletproof glass, the works.
This way.<eos> I'll be back, Claire.<eos> I promise.<eos> As far as we can tell, the building itself is on some type of hi-tech lockdown.<eos> Bulletproof glass, the works.<eos> I want teams on every entrance.<eos> Gotta be some way in.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What?
What?<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - What is it, Knight?<eos> Evidence locker at the station was hit.<eos> - When?<eos> - About an hour or so ago.<eos> They just discovered it.<eos> The C-4 is missing.<eos> The stuff from the motel?<eos> - All of it.
- About an hour or so ago.<eos> They just discovered it.<eos> The C-4 is missing.<eos> The stuff from the motel?<eos> - All of it.<eos> - Well, who did it?<eos> Surveillance was down, so they don't know who.<eos> Well, I'll give you three guesses.<eos> - Captain, we don't know what happened...<eos> - Bullshit.

You're pissed 'cause you vouched for 'em.<eos> The question now is what are they gonna do with it?<eos> - Oh, shit!<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> - Get bomb squad now!<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Evacuate everything in a two-block radius.<eos> And get ESU here.<eos> - We got a door to breach.<eos> - Yes, sir.
- Oh, shit!<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> - Get bomb squad now!<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Evacuate everything in a two-block radius.<eos> And get ESU here.<eos> - We got a door to breach.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I'll let you know when the teams are assembled.<eos> Okay, Knight.
They took hostages.<eos> Watched someone die.<eos> I'm glad you're okay.<eos> Are any of us okay?<eos> Well, that could be good.<eos> At my radio station, I tried to float... that the earthquake was a cover-up for something else.<eos> Really?<eos> What happened?<eos> - I was shut down.<eos> - By who? Your boss?

They could've quashed the story.<eos> Yeah, well, it probably means you're right.<eos> But...<eos> But, I know that we can get to the truth.<eos> We just have to...<eos> Have to be willing to play close to the fire, right?<eos> Jessica is the fire.<eos> What about that guy?<eos> Uh, the... the lawyer you work with?<eos> - Matt.
Uh, the... the lawyer you work with?<eos> - Matt.<eos> - Yeah, what's his deal?<eos> Um... he's a good friend.<eos> It's... He's, um...<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Jessica's a good friend, too.<eos> I mean, not in the traditional sense.<eos> You can't rely on her to... move a couch or plan a party, but... when it comes to the real stuff... the stuff that'll last forever...<eos> Uh, ladies?
Jessica's a good friend, too.<eos> I mean, not in the traditional sense.<eos> You can't rely on her to... move a couch or plan a party, but... when it comes to the real stuff... the stuff that'll last forever...<eos> Uh, ladies?<eos> We just heard a dispatcher call for all available units.<eos> - To where?<eos> - Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Some place called Midland Circle.<eos> 44th and 11th Avenue.<eos> - Midland Circle.
- What do you mean, "mechanical"?<eos> How deep does this go?<eos> It's hard to tell.<eos> The more I think about it, the less I like our odds.<eos> Yeah, well, do like me.<eos> Don't think about it.<eos> If you told me a week ago that I'd be here with you two, about to blow up some building and fight ninjas to save New York...<eos> Yeah.<eos> For whatever it's worth, I'm glad you're here.<eos> What?
Yeah, well, do like me.<eos> Don't think about it.<eos> If you told me a week ago that I'd be here with you two, about to blow up some building and fight ninjas to save New York...<eos> Yeah.<eos> For whatever it's worth, I'm glad you're here.<eos> What?<eos> The circumstances could be better.<eos> I'm just saying, you know, I'm glad we found each other.<eos> I'm not hugging you.<eos> You guys ready or what?
I'm just saying, you know, I'm glad we found each other.<eos> I'm not hugging you.<eos> You guys ready or what?<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> Sounds about right.<eos> - It should be right up ahead.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Claire, for what it's worth, I know Luke and the other guys have abilities, but so do you.<eos> What?
I told you our fates are aligned.<eos> Except it's not fate.<eos> I came here to end this.<eos> Did you come for me?<eos> Or did you simply follow?<eos> I trained you to believe in yourself and your purpose.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> Claire, what the hell is going on?<eos> Put Luke on the goddamn phone.<eos> Real bad timing.
Listen, you need to get your asses out of there.<eos> One of your guys brought bombs in the building.<eos> Just make sure to clear the block, okay?<eos> - There's a lot of this stuff in here.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> You know about this?<eos> Claire, whatever it is you're planning, it ends in either jail or a cemetery.<eos> Please.<eos> You guys are in way over your heads.<eos> All of you.
- Wait a minute.<eos> You know about this?<eos> Claire, whatever it is you're planning, it ends in either jail or a cemetery.<eos> Please.<eos> You guys are in way over your heads.<eos> All of you.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> What's that sound?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Claire!

She made you hold her hand as you crossed the street.<eos> You pulled away from her as though you didn't need her.<eos> Tell me... what would you give to hold that hand again?<eos> And here you are, alone.<eos> Trying to fulfill some prophecy.<eos> All to numb your pain.<eos> You can't get into my head anymore.<eos> Now tell me... what are your plans with New York?<eos> Its time has come... to fall.<eos> The elevator.
Wait!<eos> He could be useful.<eos> Perhaps you have found your family.<eos> Ten stories left.<eos> Give or take.<eos> Anyone waiting for us?<eos> Yeah, about 30 of 'em.<eos> All of 'em armed.<eos> Including two of the ones we fought in the garage.<eos> - And the old lady?
Do not bother wearing yourself out.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I know your limits.<eos> There's no damage that you can do to me that can't be undone.<eos> Especially because the Iron Fist has already given us the ultimate gift.<eos> Life without end.<eos> I'll give you one last chance to experience it with me.<eos> To be who you were meant to be.<eos> I don't need you anymore.<eos> Asshole!

- No.<eos> She did.<eos> Is that elevator the only way out of here?<eos> Yep.<eos> We can't leave.<eos> We have to end them.<eos> - We got a plan.<eos> - Yeah, it involves bombs.<eos> You're cool with bombs, right?<eos> - Seriously?
- Just like old times.<eos> Asshole, I will put you down.<eos> You disappoint me.<eos> As a child, all you ever wanted was to belong to something.<eos> That's why I saved you, Colleen.<eos> Raised you.<eos> Because that same desire was once in me.<eos> Is this your family now? Hmm?<eos> Well... let me remind you who you really are by taking that away.<eos> Colleen!
Raised you.<eos> Because that same desire was once in me.<eos> Is this your family now? Hmm?<eos> Well... let me remind you who you really are by taking that away.<eos> Colleen!<eos> She's losing too much blood.<eos> We're gonna take care of you, okay?<eos> You guys need to get to the surface.<eos> - No complaints here.<eos> - What about you?

What do you want, Matthew?<eos> I lost you once.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> I know...<eos> I know I loved you.<eos> - Your heart will be your downfall.<eos> - Please... listen to me.<eos> - I don't want to hurt you.<eos> - Too bad.
If I truly mean nothing to you, if there's truly no light inside of you, why not just do it?<eos> Because the game is fun.<eos> No.<eos> It's 'cause you still feel.<eos> For all your talk of embracing the darkness, I don't think you want to be alone in it.<eos> - I've seen death.<eos> - And you're afraid of it.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Because you'll be by my side, where you belong.<eos> Colleen?

Colleen?<eos> Danny!<eos> - What happened?<eos> - She's bleeding out.<eos> Bakuto set off the detonator.<eos> This building is about to explode.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Wait. We have to go back.<eos> - Why?<eos> - What?
- Wait. We have to go back.<eos> - Why?<eos> - What?<eos> - Matt knew.<eos> - Well, we can't leave him down there.<eos> - Go, go, go.<eos> - Hold it right there!<eos> There are bombs in this building!<eos> We gotta go!<eos> Hands in the air!
- Why?<eos> - What?<eos> - Matt knew.<eos> - Well, we can't leave him down there.<eos> - Go, go, go.<eos> - Hold it right there!<eos> There are bombs in this building!<eos> We gotta go!<eos> Hands in the air!<eos> Now!
10-33. 10-33.<eos> All officers evacuate.<eos> Evacuate. 10-33, Midland Circle.<eos> This is what we get, isn't it?<eos> For ever thinking we could make it work.<eos> Who says we didn't?<eos> We're together.<eos> Something I've wanted since I first laid eyes on you.<eos> We can have it forever.<eos> Gao...

Matt said something before he told us to leave.<eos> He said, "Protect my city."<eos> Jesus.<eos> Finally getting some answers to all the mysterious shaking and sinking around the city.<eos> The mayor's office confirms that unpermitted construction around Midland Circle is to blame.<eos> Oddly enough, I'm told the implosion actually settled the ground again, meaning we're off to a more stable start today.<eos> It's certainly weird, but what can I say?<eos> It's just another day in New York City.<eos> At least... the rent is cheap?<eos> Your thoughts, next.
It's over.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> You should be proud.<eos> Think of how many lives you saved.<eos> And the one we lost.<eos> The NYPD didn't file any report, so the city can't file any charges.<eos> According to the DA, it's over.<eos> Or more accurately, never happened.<eos> Uh, what about Claire?<eos> Claire who?
And the one we lost.<eos> The NYPD didn't file any report, so the city can't file any charges.<eos> According to the DA, it's over.<eos> Or more accurately, never happened.<eos> Uh, what about Claire?<eos> Claire who?<eos> Hogarth, Benowitz Chao at your service.<eos> I hope you'll think of us for all your legal needs.<eos> Uh, let's hope we don't have any more legal needs.<eos> Mr. Nelson...
In the suit, no less.<eos> If you'd have been there, you would have seen...<eos> He made the right call.<eos> I can't help but feel like I didn't.<eos> Look, I didn't know him as well as you did... but there was no talking him down.<eos> He had his mind made up the day I met him.<eos> He loved this city... and the people in it... more than he loved himself.<eos> Take care.<eos> And keep fighting the good fight for him.<eos> Hi.

It could've been either one of us... lying dead in the bottom of that hole.<eos> I just came to say... that I'm really... really glad it wasn't you.<eos> Try staying' in touch, Jess.<eos> You got friends.<eos> One of 'em is in Harlem.<eos> Yeah, maybe we'll grab a coffee sometime or something.<eos> How is she?<eos> She's, uh... strong.<eos> How are you?<eos> You, uh...
You still thinking about Matt Murdock?<eos> He loved this city.<eos> Sacrificed himself to protect it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, I know you, Danny.<eos> You are finding some way to beat yourself up about this.<eos> In K'un-Lun, they... they taught me that there's a lesson in every tragedy.<eos> And even while experiencing pain... there's an opportunity to grow and find clarity.<eos> Anything becoming clear?<eos> New York.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Are you right-handed, or left-handed?<eos> - That won't come up. - Well, it could come up.<eos> - It won't! Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go with left then. - I'll go with left.<eos> - Cool. Left.<eos> Let's go with the hand that I am, for Christ's sakes.<eos> Hey!<eos> Mandy.<eos> Hi. Hey. Ooh.
So, this is the hangout spot then, huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, these are my friends.<eos> Oh, so that - must make you Prudence then.<eos> - Yes. - Uh-huh. Yes, it does.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - He is Prudence, - and I'm Griffin. - No, he's Mac!<eos> He's just Mac, so don't...<eos> Yeah. And that's Charlie, and that's Frank.<eos> And he's left-handed. - Yeah.<eos> - Oh.
See, I'm always tweaking things based on the situation.<eos> And needless to say, it worked like a charm.<eos> But, uh, five months later, she calls me up, tells me she's pregnant. - Oh! - Mm.<eos> Christ, what am I gonna do here?<eos> And need I remind you, once she finds out that I'm not who I said I was, and that I don't have any money, - she could come after the bar. - Ah.<eos> - She could be entitled to that? - Ah... shit.<eos> - All right, guys, guys, everybody just calm down, all right?<eos> Maybe it's not about money for her.<eos> Look, as we all know, everything is about emotion with women. - Right, Dee?<eos> - What? ! - Whoa.

- Oh, my God. Whoa! - All right, Dee, relax.<eos> - Oh, whoa. - We're trying to have a rational conversation, okay?<eos> - Yeah, we're trying to help our friend here.<eos> - Look, I think the point is, maybe we got to close the emotion door for Mandy by telling her that you're gay.<eos> Yeah, right, but I already had sex with her.<eos> How am I gonna convince her I'm gay? Just go with me here.<eos> Brian's not above having a one-night stand with a woman, but he's got no room for her emotionally<eos> - With you?<eos> - Well, yes, the lover is me, of course.<eos> - Mm. - Next plan.
- Well, yes, the lover is me, of course.<eos> - Mm. - Next plan.<eos> - That plan stinks, because it's always about money with women.<eos> That's all there is to it.<eos> So I think the best thing to do is to find a guy who's got more money than you, like in that movie, uh, Indecent Proposal.<eos> You get a millionaire to bang her for a million bucks. She takes the money and runs.<eos> Would you sleep with her for a million dollars?<eos> No way.<eos> It's too much money.<eos> All right, next plan.

She takes the money and runs.<eos> Would you sleep with her for a million dollars?<eos> No way.<eos> It's too much money.<eos> All right, next plan.<eos> Dee.<eos> Yeah, no, I've got a great plan, but, uh, I'm thinking that this isn't my problem, and, also, you guys wouldn't listen to me no matter what I said.<eos> Good point.

If I just get the waitress pregnant, she's gonna be tied to me for life, so, I got to do that.<eos> He's already on to another thing.<eos> All right, Christ, uh, I got to do something here. - Fine.<eos> Mac, we'll go with your plan. - Yeah! - Yes!<eos> Yes.<eos> - Mm.

Huh.
- Bizarre in a good way. - No.<eos> - You don't like it?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, so, I don't mean to interrupt here, fellas, but I'm a little bit confused.<eos> You never told me you had a roommate.<eos> It's time, Brian.<eos> Here's where things get a little bit tricky.<eos> Um... there's really no easy way to say this, but, um, Mac and I aren't just friends.<eos> - He's actually my, uh...<eos> - Lover.
- You don't like it?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, so, I don't mean to interrupt here, fellas, but I'm a little bit confused.<eos> You never told me you had a roommate.<eos> It's time, Brian.<eos> Here's where things get a little bit tricky.<eos> Um... there's really no easy way to say this, but, um, Mac and I aren't just friends.<eos> - He's actually my, uh...<eos> - Lover.<eos> - Partner.
- He's the power bottom.<eos> - Now he generates a tremendous amount of power... - Yeah. No, I...<eos> - ...from the bottom. - I don't. I don't, actually.<eos> - Don't sell yourself short.<eos> He does. - No, no. It's not that I...<eos> It's just that we don't have sex. Yeah, I, uh...<eos> I sleep with women, but I'm emotionally involved with Mac, which is why... and this is the hard part...<eos> I don't have room emotionally in my life for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh...
I just got caught up in the moment, you know? It was so exciting.<eos> Maybe we should do it.<eos> We are not a couple, Mac.<eos> Well, no, we would just keep pretending.<eos> I am not gonna pretend to be in a relationship with you for the entirety of my child's life. Are you insane?<eos> Lo... okay, you know what?<eos> I can't handle this right now.<eos> I'm gonna go sleep in your room. You can sleep on the couch.<eos> Oh, no... w-w-wait, Dennis.<eos> Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.

It kind of was.<eos> It kind of was amazing. - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hmm. What is this?<eos> What are you doing there?<eos> - This? Oh, this just - Yeah.<eos> improves the chances of conception.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of getting pregnant. Oh.<eos> Right. Uh, the baby. Right.
- N-n-n-n-n-n-no. - Carrying my...<eos> I am not finished talking.<eos> Who's idea was this in the first place?<eos> Look, I'm just saying if you want to be a mom, you're gonna have to learn how to control your emotions.<eos> I need to control my emotions?<eos> Or I'm not gonna be a good mother?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Dee!<eos> - I'm in trouble here.<eos> - What?
- Yeah, we haven't got any eggs. - I need an egg.<eos> Dee, why have you not made this man his egg?<eos> Do you want to take care of this child for the rest of your life, is that what you want?<eos> Or do you want me to get out of this situation that I'm in? I'm gonna smash it!<eos> Oh, Dee, don't get emotional.<eos> Christ, if you're upset, smash an egg into a pan for Frank.<eos> Solve problems, don't cause them.<eos> Oh, gee whiz, look how fancy this place is.<eos> We don't have anything like this back in North Dakota. Oh, yeah?<eos> Fascinating.
Price goes down 'cause I already had you.<eos> But if you want to bring a girlfriend... price goes back up.<eos> - Well, I don't know what to say here. - I do.<eos> Five grand is a lot of money...<eos> is that offer just out on the table?<eos> - I'm not gonna bang you. - I don't want to bang you, either, Frank,<eos> - but I'll power through for five grand.<eos> - Well, no, you wouldn't want to, because you're emotionally involved with me. Aw. Shit.<eos> Sorry, Dennis.<eos> - Hey. Dennis? - Brian,
- I'm not gonna bang you. - I don't want to bang you, either, Frank,<eos> - but I'll power through for five grand.<eos> - Well, no, you wouldn't want to, because you're emotionally involved with me. Aw. Shit.<eos> Sorry, Dennis.<eos> - Hey. Dennis? - Brian,<eos> I meant.<eos> I'm sorry. - Yeah, sometimes...<eos> - Brian is his name.<eos> Dennis is his sex slave name. - He's my gimp.<eos> - What? No.

- Wait, hold on, what's going on here, Brian? Look,<eos> I'm gonna go to the can and make my morning move.<eos> You want the cash, you come on in, earn it the hard way. If the broad comes, order me an egg.<eos> Well, that was a disaster. Frank almost ruined everything.<eos> Okay, do you want me to go down to the car and talk to her?<eos> And spin more perverted tales about me? Why am I a gimp?<eos> Oh, God, just get your kid and get out of here, Dennis.<eos> Yeah, I'll get the kid, but I got to come back because I need to crash here tonight.<eos> I'm not sleeping next to Mac's dildo bike again.<eos> No, me too.
I didn't want to be wrapped up in the kid thing, that's your mistake. Listen to me,<eos> I can figure this out, I've got a new plan and you're all gonna goddamn listen up, okay?<eos> It's time for Brian LeFevre to die.<eos> - Over here. Over here.<eos> - Hmm? - Go, go, go, go, go, go.<eos> - What... where... what is-what is going on here?<eos> I thought-I thought we were gonna go see the Liberty Bell. There's no time for that, there's no time.<eos> What... what is going on here, Brian?<eos> All right, listen to me, because we only have a few minutes before they realize they can't hear or see us back here.<eos> What?
Normally you'd... you'd hear it before you see the blood, but, uh, not in this case.<eos> Run!<eos> Oh, it's killing me.<eos> Run, Mandy, no.<eos> You... you have to run and not ever look back.<eos> Or contact me ever again.<eos> And you'll never get any money or assets from me because if you do, it'll be unsafe for you.<eos> Run!<eos> Oh, my God! - They got Dennis.<eos> - Dane.

Not a regular hospital, though, 'cause technically, - he's not supposed to exist.<eos> - A bad guy one. Oh, no, I've lost my lover.<eos> I'll need a new gimp!<eos> I'm not his lover.<eos> Never had sex.<eos> Not a gimp.<eos> Oh, run, Mandy. Oh.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Uh... good-bye, Mandy, good-bye.<eos> Brian Jr.
Come on.<eos> You can open your eyes now, I know you're not dead.<eos> Ah, geez.<eos> You big city folks sure like to complicate things, don't ya?<eos> Look, all I wanted was for Brian Jr. to have a father, but we don't want to be with a man who doesn't want to be with us.<eos> So, I guess we'll just... be getting back to North Dakota now.<eos> Okay, now, you want to come on up here and say good-bye to Brian Jr.?<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> - Yeah. Hey, buddy.

- It's not done, no. We're still in here.<eos> Shh, just let me...<eos> Don't start talking, I can tell...<eos> - We weren't gonna say anything.<eos> - The pause is too big. Well, this is, again, this is why I'm leaving.<eos> Oh, good-bye.<eos> - Good-bye.<eos> Hmm. I can't believe he's actually gone.<eos> - Yeah. - That's crazy.<eos> Well, now what?

Over his car.<eos> And a puppy.<eos> And you... you think he will stop now?<eos> Sir, he's one man.<eos> Why don't we just eliminate him?<eos> John Wick... is a man of focus... commitment... and sheer fucking will.<eos> He once killed three men in a bar...<eos> With a pencil.<eos> I know. I've heard the story.<eos> With a fucking pencil!

No big deal.<eos> Let me know when it's fixed. All right.<eos> It'll be ready Christmas... 2030.<eos> Ciao, John. Santino.<eos> Café?

I have no choice?<eos> You dishonor the marker, you die.<eos> You kill the holder of the marker, you die.<eos> You run, you die.<eos> This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.<eos> Do what the man asks.<eos> Be free.<eos> Then, if you want to go after him, burn his house down, be my guest.<eos> But until then...<eos> Rules.

No.<eos> Good dog.
How exciting.<eos> Yet you know you cannot, can you?<eos> I told you, I needed that guy, the way you are looking at me right now.<eos> I needed the Boogeyman.<eos> I needed John Wick.<eos> Just... tell me what you want.<eos> I want you to kill my sister.<eos> Why?<eos> There are 12 seats at the High Table.<eos> Camorra, Mafia, and 'Ndrangheta.

He was already back.<eos> Oh, he came back for love, not for you.<eos> He owed me.<eos> I had every right.<eos> And now, he's coming again.<eos> He did tell you not to do this.<eos> He did warn you.<eos> Addio Santino.<eos> Please notify MTA personnel of any suspicious activity.<eos> Your attention, please.

You gave me this.<eos> Gift from the Boogeyman.<eos> Perfect for every occasion.<eos> But you also gave me a choice.<eos> Pull my gun, shoot you in the back, and die, or keep the pressure on my neck... and live.<eos> And so you see, I survived.<eos> No one sneaks up on me anymore, thanks to you.<eos> I am all-seeing, and all-knowing.<eos> Then you know why I'm here.<eos> Santino D'Antonio, yes.
You, and you with me.<eos> You go.<eos> Welcome to Reflections of the Soul at the New Modern NYC.<eos> Within this exhibition, the interplay of light and the nature of self-images coalesce to provide an experience which will highlight the fragility of our perception of space and our place within it.<eos> We hope through this exhibit we can provide new insights into your understanding of the world, and just possibly lead you to deeper reflection into the nature of self.<eos> The marker is complete, John.<eos> You should have just run away.<eos> You know what the Camorra will do to you.<eos> You think you're Old Testament?<eos> No John.
You think you're Old Testament?<eos> No John.<eos> No.<eos> Killing me won't stop the contract.<eos> Killing me, will make it so much worse.<eos> John. You know what I think?<eos> I think you are addicted to it.<eos> To the vengeance.<eos> Welcome to Reflections of the Soul at the New Modern NYC.<eos> No wife.
No life.<eos> No home.<eos> Vengeance... it's all you have.<eos> You wanted me back.<eos> I'm back.<eos> You are now exiting Reflections of the Soul, at the New Modern NYC.<eos> We hope that your journey through the exhibit, has been one of reflective contemplation allowing for a new perspective and insight.<eos> You are now exiting Reflections of the Soul.<eos> You are now exiting Reflections of the Soul.<eos> Good evening.

You're like, "What's that rascal Charlie up to?" "What's he up to this time?" Right, right?<eos> - I'm not thinking that at all.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, well, it's an issue of aerodynamics, really.<eos> You see, every second counts in the water park. - Right.<eos> - And we plan to ride - every single ride in there today.<eos> - Yup. Yeah, the brochure says three days.<eos> We're saying bullshit to that.<eos> - We're gonna get it done in one. - One day.<eos> All right, well, good luck with that 'cause you got, like, ten minutes of clean water and then every slide's basically a urine delivery system.<eos> - Yeah.
this water's already infested with every parasite on the planet.<eos> And I, for one, have no intention of stepping foot in any of it.<eos> So what do you come to a water park for?<eos> Hot food, cold beer, bikini'd women seeking relief from the insufferable prison of motherhood.<eos> Yeah, lot of pleasures to be had at the park, Frank. - None of which involve piss. - Hmm.<eos> And it's all free, too, if you know how to get it.<eos> Well, it's not free, you got to pay to get in.<eos> Not me, I had my bracelet laminated in the '90s.<eos> I haven't paid to get in here since I was 14.<eos> - Nice!

No one's thinking about that at all.<eos> Oh, good, 'cause it is bad news.<eos> Those things will suck the intestines right out of you.<eos> Like it did to that one kid back in '96.<eos> Now, she had to chew through her intestines - just to get free.<eos> - When I see the drain, I'm not gonna go try and sit on it.<eos> - Oh, here we go.<eos> - Okay, here we go!

Your stupid wrist band got us all jammed up.<eos> It's not just that.<eos> The slide's too small, the nerd was right.<eos> Shit, what are we gonna do?<eos> Uh... okay. Just remain calm, all right?<eos> Do not panic, that's the worst thing you can do.<eos> Okay, but we got to get unstuck before they send another kid because... oh, God, some big, fat kid's just gonna come blasting down on us.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> Trust me.<eos> - Shit!
We got to get going here.<eos> - I know, goddamn it.<eos> - Where's he going?<eos> - Coming through.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> - What, what? How come he can cut to the front?<eos> Oh, Ethan is here with a special program for children with leukemia, so he skips to the front of the line.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Coming through.<eos> AIDS!
- Well...<eos> There's two kind of AIDS... there's the vagina AIDS and then the needle-based AIDS.<eos> I-I'm a vagina guy.<eos> - Well, no, actually my test results show - I got... sorry, I'm... AIDS.<eos> that it was the gay AIDS. - All AIDS are bad.<eos> - Well... That's... no good AIDS.<eos> But I'm telling you, like I said, this is not the gay AIDS.<eos> Lie back down.<eos> One of these little stinkers yours?<eos> My son.

What?<eos> Oh, hi there, what's your name?<eos> Abby. I'm hungry, Daddy.<eos> Can I please have $20?<eos> Well, I think you can get something to eat for a lot less than that, hon.<eos> Dad! I'm hungry, I'm starving, and you haven't given me any money.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Anything for my little...<eos> Abby.
- Oh, disgusting!<eos> Sorry's not gonna cut it, Sherman,<eos> - it's not gonna cut it. - Nobody else pee!<eos> Ah, the sun's just blasting me right in the face.<eos> Why does it have to be right there?<eos> Dee, if God put the sun there, there's probably a reason, okay?<eos> Don't question him; we need God!<eos> God didn't put the sun anywhere.<eos> The sun stays still; the Earth moves around it.<eos> - Oh, Jesus Christ. - Okay. All right.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Kid, kid, kid, listen.<eos> Come here.<eos> Before you go, no matter how alluring it is, do not put your genitals or your butthole near the pool drain.<eos> - In fact, cover your butthole. - Okay, go.<eos> - Okay, kid. Go, kid, go!<eos> - Come on. Go.<eos> Cover that butthole, kid! Mac.<eos> Stop talking to children about their buttholes, okay? - It's not appropriate.<eos> - Okay.

You don't get the sunglasses.<eos> - You need to be taught a lesson. - I think that she gets...<eos> I really appreciate everything that you do.<eos> Real police officer to security guard, honestly, I want to thank you for everything. - Thanks.<eos> - This little girl, she's gonna be grounded for a month.<eos> Come on, Abigail, let's go.<eos> Try to touch me, and I'll scream "rape."<eos> Please.<eos> I see the road you're headed down:<eos> the lying, the stealing, all of it.
- These are too small for me. - Yeah.<eos> - You get the point.<eos> - I got AIDS, AIDS. - AIDS!<eos> Guy with AIDS, coming through.<eos> AIDS, coming through. AIDS, AIDS...<eos> - Hey, man, go through. Hey, go for it, go, go, go!<eos> No, you need a raft! You need a raft!<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> - My camera!

I don't know.<eos> I mean, that-that's not on the map...<eos> what ride is that? Excuse me?<eos> - Excuse me, ma'am? - Yeah?<eos> What is this ride over here?<eos> Oh, that's our new slide.<eos> It's, uh, Thunder Gun Express. We just finished construction.<eos> It'll be open in a few weeks.<eos> - A Thunder Gun ride? - Yeah.<eos> Like the movie?

It's just pooling up. - Well, I got to tell you something, though, I...<eos> - Huh?<eos> I don't know if I'm gonna be able to hold it much longer. - What? !<eos> - I-I've been in here for so long, I-I...<eos> Don't you do it, Dee!<eos> Don't you do it! The problem is it's already happening.<eos> I'm peeing on your shoulder right now.<eos> But I don't mean to, I'm sorry.<eos> - It's warm.<eos> - You bitch!

Like the girl in the pool drain when she got her anus stuck, she chewed through her prolapsed anus and chewed herself to freedom.<eos> - What are you talking about? ! - Sherman!<eos> Get your mouth to this bracelet and chew!<eos> Aw, screw it. Try it. Chew like you've never chewed before.<eos> Go, Sherman, chew!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?<eos> I got some boy to give me this.<eos> I said I'd kiss him if he met me in the parking lot.<eos> Then I swiped his wristband, so he can't get back in. Nice.<eos> Thanks.
See, this is why the Chinese are destroying us.<eos> If you were born in China, you'd be the head of some factory by now.<eos> Or they would've thrown you in a river, 'cause you weren't a boy.<eos> All right, it's not a great analogy, but you get my point.<eos> A-Abby... you deserve better. Here, I...<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> No, what do you mean? You earned that.<eos> No, please, take it.<eos> So you never forget me.<eos> Thanks, Dennis.

They should've sent a poet.<eos> - All right, let's go, let's go. - Okay.<eos> - All right, all right. - Okay. Here we go.<eos> This should be good, right? Oh, that's great.<eos> - That'll do it.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Who's going first?<eos> Well, it should be you, right?<eos> I mean, you pulled off the AIDS thing. Oh, Charlie!<eos> Charlie!

No, your mom is the monster, all right?<eos> My mom is the sweet one.<eos> Oh, the sweet one?
Is that a hieroglyph of a dog?<eos> Yeah, that's the animal my mom fears the most, right?<eos> She-she feels trapped inside her own home.<eos> There is no way you could get that from this.<eos> Oh-oh, okay, guys, guys, guys. I think I have a pretty simple solution here.<eos> You see, ever since I moved in with Mac, and Dee and Old Black Man, my surveillance system's just lying around in storage.<eos> I got about a baker's dozen of cameras. They're just sitting there.<eos> I say we set them up in your mom's home and find out what's really going on in there. - That could work.<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> - Great idea.

I mean, yeah.<eos> - Great idea.<eos> - You don't think that's creepy?<eos> - What? He's talking about spying on your moms.<eos> So what?<eos> You can't spy on unsuspecting women.<eos> That's horrible.<eos> Uh, they're not women. They're old.<eos> At a certain point a woman goes from being a woman to just being an old person.<eos> - True.
Okay, and no one's gonna get hurt.<eos> It's not like they're gonna get exploited in any way, right?<eos> No, no, no, exactly.<eos> I think once we have a look at what's going on in there, we might find the situation to be, uh, pretty comical.<eos> Oh, it's so nice of you to bring us all these lovely gifts, Charlie.<eos> The plant, the globe, and the little teddy bear.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, Mom. No, we aren't gonna touch the gifts, right?<eos> Okay, we don't touch them. We just, we look at them. - Okay.<eos> - And they look back at you and they...<eos> Hands off.
There you go. She's abusing my mom, man.<eos> It's clear as day, but what's really interesting is what seems to be happening right here in the live feed.<eos> Oh. You want to sleep.<eos> Well, I'll sleep you.<eos> - Uh... what the hell, man?<eos> - That's your mom abusing my mom! - Well...<eos> No, it's not!<eos> That's just one of those things, you know,<eos> - What thing? You know, where you're just like, you're like, it's like a "Why, I oughta," but, you know, it's no big deal.<eos> - Why, I oughta what?
- and you add a laugh track... - I know, but the laughing tells me that it's funny.<eos> They have timing, man.<eos> - They have timing, for sure.<eos> Yeah. - That's great.<eos> I don't understand. Is this a dark situation or a comical one?<eos> Well, we-we don't really know yet, Mac. We don't know.<eos> But... I tell you what, why don't we stick around back here for a little while. Let's watch how this whole thing plays out.<eos> I'll keep sweetening the situation as it calls for it, and you might as well stick around.<eos> Did you just ash in my tapioca?<eos> Mm-hmm.
Cut to a close-up.<eos> And she's constantly looking directly into the camera somehow.<eos> - She's repulsive.<eos> - She is repulsive. You know what? I'm gonna go over there and-and I'm gonna show you.<eos> Sh-she can pop, okay?<eos> She's gonna pop.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> - What's up? My mom's trying to call me.<eos> Hmm.
She's gonna pop.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> - What's up? My mom's trying to call me.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, wait, you know what?<eos> Don't pick up.<eos> Don't pick up.<eos> - Oh, no, I never would. - Okay, good. But let's let that play out.<eos> Camera one.
Um, now I'm thinking about minotaurs.<eos> Now I'm thinking about a hoagie sandwich.<eos> Now I'm thinking about a glass of water to go with the chips.<eos> How-how many of my thoughts do you need? Do you want me to go on and on, or...<eos> No, that's...<eos> Mom, you know that I think you are the most captivating and beautiful woman in the world, don't you? - No. - Oh!<eos> I got something for you.<eos> Sort of brighten you up a little bit. What the hell is that?<eos> Lipstick.<eos> "Heartbreaker."
Now I'm thinking about a hoagie sandwich.<eos> Now I'm thinking about a glass of water to go with the chips.<eos> How-how many of my thoughts do you need? Do you want me to go on and on, or...<eos> No, that's...<eos> Mom, you know that I think you are the most captivating and beautiful woman in the world, don't you? - No. - Oh!<eos> I got something for you.<eos> Sort of brighten you up a little bit. What the hell is that?<eos> Lipstick.<eos> "Heartbreaker."<eos> Just like you.
Mom, you know that I think you are the most captivating and beautiful woman in the world, don't you? - No. - Oh!<eos> I got something for you.<eos> Sort of brighten you up a little bit. What the hell is that?<eos> Lipstick.<eos> "Heartbreaker."<eos> Just like you.<eos> I ain't wearing no lipstick.<eos> Come on, Mom.<eos> Be-be agreeable, which makes you rootable, which makes you likeable.<eos> (bleep) you!
That's good... buzz off.<eos> You know, that's like, uh, a call back, which could become a catchphrase.<eos> You should probably think of a few more so you're not just too one-note.<eos> What about, um,<eos> "I can't even."<eos> Or, "That went well."<eos> I'm gonna take a shit.<eos> That's not a good catchphrase.<eos> It is healthy, though. Oh...<eos> Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Do I hear someone upstairs? Oh, neighbor!<eos> Just swingin' by to say, "Hello." Will you look at that?<eos> I've got my dumb head stuck in the banister.<eos> - Dee's a nightmare, dude.<eos> - It's awful.<eos> You're not gonna try and put a laugh in, or... Uh, nowhere to put it.<eos> Yeah, you can't tell where the jokes<eos> - are supposed to be. - Exactly.<eos> Whoops.<eos> Okay.

Okay.<eos> It's actually a little bit stuck...<eos> Mac?<eos> Mac, you want to come pull on me?<eos> Dee, I-I don't know what you're doing, because n-none of this is playing, and you're not funny at all and...<eos> Hey, you know what, Dee? From here, what you're doing actually is kind of funny.<eos> I wish we could get Mac out of there. - Oh, I know.<eos> - Terrible.<eos> He's making me sick.<eos> - Yeah. - Ugly.
Dee, I-I don't know what you're doing, because n-none of this is playing, and you're not funny at all and...<eos> Hey, you know what, Dee?

She lives in the goddamn house.<eos> Well, I'm gonna cut around her, then.<eos> - Yeah, we're gonna... - Until the ethnic comes, and then - we're gonna need your mom's room.<eos> - We're gonna get an ethnic.<eos> - You can't get rid of my mom! - I'm getting rid of her.<eos> - I'm going to cut around her.<eos> - Mac, - she's out, she's out.<eos> - I'm gonna... This is...<eos> He thinks she pops. - She's terrible.<eos> - Yeah.
- Mac, - she's out, she's out.<eos> - I'm gonna... This is...<eos> He thinks she pops. - She's terrible.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Kelly. - Mrs. Kelly, hold on. Just give me one second.<eos> - Ooh! One, two, three. - One, two three.<eos> - What?<eos> What?<eos> - One, two, three.<eos> - Oh, my God, what?

Not now, Deandra.<eos> Oh, by the way, none of the stuff you're doing is playing.<eos> Except for the fart stuff.<eos> What fart stuff?<eos> You should have farted after you said that.<eos> Just come help me get out of this thing.<eos> - Put a fart in, Dennis. - What?<eos> Oh, goddamn it, what's Frank doing over there? You know what, I think he's playing the scumbag who comes in off the street to bang your mom.<eos> Well, I don't want him banging my mom, dude.<eos> Shit.

Get lost.<eos> I'm gonna bang your sister. You got it.<eos> Goddamn it, dude,<eos> This is gross.<eos> I-I don't want this.<eos> Can we turn this into something else? You know what, maybe we could turn this into, like, a love triangle thing between Jack, your mom and Frank?<eos> Well, maybe... No, I don't want a love triangle between...<eos> - Well...<eos> - I don't want any shape of love between them. That's just gross.<eos> Ooh!
Up. Back to the plant.<eos> Can't cut around her when she's in every shot, can you, Dennis?<eos> - And look at the teddy bear.<eos> And the plant. - Great. This disgusting bitch is in every shot?<eos> I don't want to stand here no more.<eos> I got to take another dump.<eos> Oh, look, Mom, no more shitting, all right?<eos> Um... and when you go, are you not having a full elimination?<eos> I mean, why are you going so much?<eos> Mom?
I mean, why are you going so much?<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom, where are you?<eos> Don't try and steal focus, Charlie.<eos> - Charlie, can't breathe. - What? What?<eos> Help. Help, Charlie.<eos> Get off me, you crazy bitch!<eos> Mom, look, no more shitting!<eos> - Let's go, we got to go where the action is.<eos> - Oh! Mom!
Get off!<eos> - Mom stays in the picture.<eos> - Let's go, come on!<eos> - Charlie! I only got to third!<eos> - Come on, get out of here. Go.<eos> You can have any woman you want... it's got to be my mom?<eos> Hey, come on, what are you doing?<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Okay, Mom, we got to go where the action is.<eos> God... Goddamn it!
I got to say it: that's the best episode yet.<eos> That is! - It's a classic!<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I love the button at the ending. - Yeah?<eos> - Oh, that was the biggest joke - in the show. The biggest moment.<eos> - Was it? - I mean it, really.<eos> - Oh, well, guys, look, I told you... - I know my physical comedy.<eos> - Oh! - Oh! - What are you doing?<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Hey. Show's been canceled, guys.<eos> - What?

Show's been canceled, guys.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - Wha... I got a four-episode sex arc.<eos> You know, now-now that everybody knows they're being filmed, it's more like a reality TV show, and I just can't enjoy it when the people who are being filmed<eos> - Yeah, but what about our show, man?

It's become the official drink of Boca Raton.<eos> Why do you ask? Well, just 'cause of this.<eos> The group released another video today.<eos> _ _<eos> _ _<eos> Preliminary investigations have revealed that Wolf Cola may in fact be an American soda company, although how and why Boko Haram has adopted it as their official soft drink is unknown at this time.<eos> We'll keep you updated on this story as it develops.<eos> Boca Raton, Frank?<eos> Or the official soft drink of Boko Haram?<eos> Whoops.
Boca Raton, Frank?<eos> Or the official soft drink of Boko Haram?<eos> Whoops.<eos> How do you confuse a city in Florida with a terrorist organization in Africa?<eos> It's an easy misunderstanding.<eos> It is if you're an elderly cokehead, trying to launder money through a dummy soda corporation.<eos> This is bigger than cola, Dee.<eos> This is gonna touch all of Frank's Fluids.<eos> My God, there are other fluids?<eos> Yeah, Wolf Cola, some Nip boba drink... Fight Milk.
Yeah, you really screwed yourself this time, Frank. Hey, do you mind?<eos> Yeah, go ahead.<eos> I'm screwed?<eos> You're going down, too, buddy.<eos> What?<eos> Remember when you wanted all the power so you could get the puss?<eos> I made you executive vice president of worldwide distribution.<eos> Shit, but nobody knows that, right?<eos> I mean, dude, I only wanted the illusion of power.<eos> The-the illusion.
Shit, but nobody knows that, right?<eos> I mean, dude, I only wanted the illusion of power.<eos> The-the illusion.<eos> I never saw an ounce of puss.<eos> Oh, this is a good day for me.<eos> - You're going down, too?<eos> This is great.<eos> - You're laughing?<eos> You're executive vice president of operations. - Oh.<eos> - What?
Because we only have 24 hours.<eos> This is why we had to wait for you to go to Bed Bath Beyond? Yes, bitch.<eos> Now, listen, we live in the age of the 24-hour news cycle, which means we only have 24 hours to respond to this, okay?<eos> If we don't, then Internet trolls are gonna control the narrative.<eos> I don't know how we're gonna come back from dealing with terrorists.<eos> Christ, Mercedes built Nazi tanks, okay?<eos> And the Jews are still driving their cars around.<eos> Floyd Mayweather beat the shit out of multiple women and he's the highest paid athlete of all time. All right?<eos> There's only one thing you can't come back from... banging kids.<eos> Well, what about the Catholic Church? Hmm.
- you should lead with that. - I'm screwing up the pitch.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna jump in here.<eos> We're-we're a couple of crow enthusiasts who wanted to take the power and essence of a crow and-and we packed that into a delicious milk drink - that we invented, thus Fight Milk. - Yeah.<eos> I don't know what you guys are talking about right now, but I have heard of your stuff and Cerrone and Felder, they actually love it. - Are you kidding me, dude?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cowboy Cerrone and Paul Felder drink Fight Milk?<eos> Oh, they love it. They crush it. - They crush it.<eos> - They're crushing...<eos> - That's... - Fight Milk is supposed to be crushed.<eos> Uh, this is for wiping yourself down.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, thanks, bro. - Okay, man.

- Oh, no.<eos> - No, no, that's fine, yeah.<eos> So, Fight Milk makes you sick?<eos> Makes you expel all body fluids.<eos> Sweat, piss, and shit; we got these weigh-ins coming up.<eos> Nothing cuts weight like Fight Milk.<eos> Oh, you're using it to cut weight, huh?<eos> Yeah, they should give you guys a Nobel...<eos> Oh, I just puked on my dick!<eos> Rock and roll. All right, cool.

Uh, this by no means reflects our ideals as a premium soda company.<eos> We're a family-run business, and we really care about people's concerns.<eos> Listen, the point is, we have heard you all, and we are working tirelessly to remedy this situation.<eos> Well, not an easy situation, indeed, but handled with grace and aplomb. Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.<eos> And it looks like you're already getting good feedback.<eos> Oh, that's-that's great. Well, uh, thank you, Chet.<eos> And I want to say thank you to America...<eos> And also, we're sorry.<eos> We accept full responsibility for this heinous mistake, and please know that I am actively firing people as we speak, because I am the boss.<eos> Bitch.

Yes.<eos> Next up, a heroic tale...
People calling me a bitch, flat-chested bitch, pretty much everybody wanting to rape me.<eos> You opened that door the second you apologized, Dee.<eos> You don't see this?<eos> People need an outlet to unleash their rage.<eos> Now social media will come down on you with the fury of a middle-aged man who's accomplished nothing.<eos> - Hi-yo!<eos> - What's up, bitches?<eos> What's that?<eos> What do you got?<eos> Huh? Crow traps, baby.
The fastest-growing marketplace is Muslim extremists.<eos> Frank, we're not going into business with terrorists.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Look, we need to get back on TV immediately and control the goddamn narrative.<eos> Yeah, speaking of TV, we're gonna be doing a little controlling of our narrative, so you guys mind clearing out?<eos> Yeah, this is now our set.<eos> All right, come on, we got work to do, guys. Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Don't forget your phone, - stupid idiot.<eos> - Yep.

Or women.<eos> But yes.<eos> But definitely - crow-power fighting skills.<eos> - Either way, - Absolutely. - I think, dude, we got to get back to the lab.<eos> I think we got to get some more crows.<eos> From dog fighting to finding a loving home.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Now, who wouldn't want to adopt a little guy like this?<eos> Well said, Mike.<eos> Great story.
Great story.<eos> Now a local soda company is back in hot water with controversial remarks.<eos> Returning to talk about it today is the team from Wolf Cola.<eos> Thank you so much for having us back, Chet.<eos> Um, we at Wolf Cola are not just about making a satisfying soda.<eos> We are about making satisfied customers.<eos> We do acknowledge consumers' concerns.<eos> Yes, but we are not apologizing.<eos> - Right.<eos> Oh. - Sorry.
Um, I assure you that we have righted this ship, and we are taking every step necessary to address all of your concerns.<eos> We at Wolf Cola hope to be a part of your family's daily refreshment for years to come.<eos> And we can say that without saying I'm sorry.<eos> Well, Mr. Reynolds, it sounds like Wolf Cola has the right man in charge.<eos> Yeah. Well, I appreciate that.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Whoa. I thought we were done with the dog segment.<eos> - What the hell's this?<eos> - Oh. Looks like we got a lovable little guy loose in the studio here.<eos> Yeah. Can we get him out of here?<eos> - Great.
Authorities soon focused on the suspicious nature of her death.<eos> My name is Lance Girard.<eos> I've been with the Philadelphia Police Department for 24 years, 12 of which were with the Homicide division.<eos> I've seen a lot of things.<eos> A man wants to turn himself into a woman?<eos> Okay.<eos> Who am I to judge?<eos> But, really, a cat?<eos> What's next?<eos> A watermelon?
I've seen a lot of things.<eos> A man wants to turn himself into a woman?<eos> Okay.<eos> Who am I to judge?<eos> But, really, a cat?<eos> What's next?<eos> A watermelon?<eos> First thing we wanted to establish is to whether the deceased was acting strange.<eos> Not like "I'm turning myself into a cat" strange.<eos> More like suicide strange.
24 years on the job, I'd never seen anything like it.<eos> Two hours.<eos> Never moved.<eos> Never blinked.<eos> Gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.<eos> He had all the right answers, but my gut told me this guy was guilty.<eos> Of something.<eos> Did I kill Maureen?<eos> No. Am I glad she's dead?<eos> Sure.
Never moved.<eos> Never blinked.<eos> Gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.<eos> He had all the right answers, but my gut told me this guy was guilty.<eos> Of something.<eos> Did I kill Maureen?<eos> No. Am I glad she's dead?<eos> Sure.<eos> Maureen's family was convinced of Dennis's guilt.<eos> Maureen?
Maureen?<eos> Maureen died three years ago.<eos> Dennis killed Bastet, all right?<eos> And let me tell you something.<eos> He did us all a favor.<eos> You ever seen a grown woman take a dump in a sandbox?<eos> Despite conjecture, the question still remained:<eos> Was there anything in Dennis Reynolds' past that would suggest him capable of murder?<eos> Testing. Testing.<eos> Syphilis. Syphilis.
Look... that crow was injured, and I was simply putting it out of its misery, while, yes, testing the tensile strength of a crow's neck.<eos> Well, yes, there was another crow, but that's because I simply couldn't believe that a crow's neck could be that weak.<eos> Well, yes, there was a third crow, and a fourth, if you must know, but who likes crows?<eos> Look, if you can kill a crow, you can kill a cat.<eos> Cat, cat, cat... That's why I started recording all our conversations.<eos> I suspected Frank was probably recording all of our conversations, because of course he would.<eos> But let me tell you something, he was no fan of Maureen's, either.<eos> He was just trying to deflect attention, which is why I started recording all of our conversations as well.<eos> I could have worn a goddamn IMAX camera around my neck and he wouldn't have noticed.<eos> The old bitch.
Look, if you can kill a crow, you can kill a cat.<eos> Cat, cat, cat... That's why I started recording all our conversations.<eos> I suspected Frank was probably recording all of our conversations, because of course he would.<eos> But let me tell you something, he was no fan of Maureen's, either.<eos> He was just trying to deflect attention, which is why I started recording all of our conversations as well.<eos> I could have worn a goddamn IMAX camera around my neck and he wouldn't have noticed.<eos> The old bitch.<eos> And I caught him saying some pretty troubling stuff.<eos> What are we watching here?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cats, cats.
Back in the sweatshop in 'Nam, we found a cat, we tossed it right in the soup.<eos> Those hungry bastards ate cat soup every day.<eos> What's the worst thing that could happen?<eos> Some little kid choke on a hairball and die.<eos> So then you toss him in the soup.<eos> I was making money hand over foot, literally.<eos> Somebody lost a hand or a foot, I'd toss it in the soup.<eos> Well, that's all a lie.<eos> Uh, there was no soup.<eos> Nope.
Look, it's funny, Dennis.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> Are we done with this?<eos> Can we be done?<eos> I'm tired of saying the same things over and over again.<eos> Well, wait. Wh... hold...<eos> Dennis, d-don't leave without me.<eos> I mean, dude, look, are you mad at me?<eos> Investigators could find no discrepancies in the timeline.<eos> But then... a twist.
I'm tired of saying the same things over and over again.<eos> Well, wait. Wh... hold...<eos> Dennis, d-don't leave without me.<eos> I mean, dude, look, are you mad at me?<eos> Investigators could find no discrepancies in the timeline.<eos> But then... a twist.<eos> He totally could have done it.<eos> Now, supposably, Dennis didn't see Maureen that night, but remember that Maureen was once Dennis's...<eos> "Wife.<eos> Very nice."
You know, because cats hate water.<eos> So, you see, Dennis totally saw Maureen that night.<eos> Charlie was there.<eos> Why hasn't he spoken up?<eos> Probably because Dennis... intimidated him.<eos> Oh, I just thought it'd be more dramatic if I...<eos> Oh, come on, come on.<eos> I didn't lie. I just left out some facts that are insignificant.<eos> And-and intimidate Charlie?<eos> Please.
I didn't lie. I just left out some facts that are insignificant.<eos> And-and intimidate Charlie?<eos> Please.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> Call him on the phone and threaten him?<eos> No, I know.<eos> But, I mean, if Mac's gonna do it, then, you know, I'm gonna do it.<eos> At this point in the interrogation, Christ, I was at a loss.<eos> Further inspection of Dennis Reynolds' safe revealed a cache of suspicious items.<eos> Awesome.
Dennis has an answer for everything.<eos> Well, answer me this:<eos> Where's the collar?<eos> Cats have collars.<eos> Maureen's body didn't have a collar on it.<eos> Killers keep trophies.<eos> Alls I'm saying, find the collar, find the killer.<eos> This is not the first time the collar came up.<eos> Dee Reynolds had, oddly, made the collar an issue during filming.<eos> Hey.
But at the end of the day, you know, I'm just some guy with a crazy ex-wife who fell off of a roof pretending to be a cat.<eos> That's the end of it.<eos> All my stories checked out.<eos> I was cleared.<eos> Case closed.<eos> Find the collar, find the killer.<eos> Find the collar, find the killer.<eos> ...'cause a dog is who I am now!<eos> ...hit the referee! Find the collar...<eos> "Very nice."
Find the collar, find the killer.<eos> ...'cause a dog is who I am now!<eos> ...hit the referee! Find the collar...<eos> "Very nice."<eos> Find the collar, find the killer.<eos> Guys, this was an open-and-shut case that was shut months ago.<eos> And Maureen never wore a collar.<eos> You guys put that there.<eos> Well, yeah, we needed a big twist at the end to show that you're guilty.<eos> But I'm-I'm not guilty.
Let's think about that, right?<eos> He's destroying the tapes...<eos> You know what, that would be "very nice."<eos> Is that Borat?<eos> Yes! See?<eos> He gets it. He's laughing.<eos> - Yeah, 'cause I know he was doing an impression. - He's laughing.<eos> Okay, wait, uh, let me... let me think of another one.<eos> Let me think of another one. "I'll be back."<eos> Oh...
What's going on with you, man?<eos> Are you limping?<eos> Uh, no, I've just been working out on this new exercise bike I got,<eos> - and my glutes are, like, so sore. - Yeah.<eos> Know what it is?<eos> - Yeah, big-time, big-time. - Howdy.
What's going on with you, man?<eos> Are you limping?<eos> Uh, no, I've just been working out on this new exercise bike I got,<eos> - and my glutes are, like, so sore. - Yeah.<eos> Know what it is?<eos> - Yeah, big-time, big-time. - Howdy.<eos> - Hi.
What's going on with you, man?<eos> Are you limping?<eos> Uh, no, I've just been working out on this new exercise bike I got,<eos> - and my glutes are, like, so sore. - Yeah.<eos> Know what it is?<eos> - Yeah, big-time, big-time. - Howdy.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - It's... it's very windy today, isn't it? Yeah.<eos> Oh, man, look at this.<eos> Dog shit.
- It's... it's very windy today, isn't it? Yeah.<eos> Oh, man, look at this.<eos> Dog shit.<eos> Did you just step in that on purpose? Oh, no, I just...<eos> you know, I didn't really see it.<eos> You pointed it out to me!<eos> And then you stepped directly in it.<eos> - Since when do you read? - What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No.
- It was just an accident, man.<eos> People step in dog shit accidentally all the time.<eos> Is that a lottery scratcher?<eos> Sometimes it's in, - sometimes it's out.<eos> - Are those mirrors? - No. - You creep.<eos> Look out, faggot!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> God! Are you okay?<eos> Hey, Frank, what the hell was that?<eos> What?
- Yeah, that's... you.<eos> That's you.<eos> Because a great injustice has occurred, okay?<eos> Frank committed a hate crime. I saved your life.<eos> - But you used a slur!<eos> - It was a slur.<eos> - That's... - You'd be dead if I didn't!<eos> Okay, okay, I think I'm getting it.<eos> You want me to figure out whether or not a hate crime's been committed? What?<eos> - No.
The thing is, each one of us feels that we're entitled to that ticket, and we need you - to tell us who it belongs to. - Yeah.<eos> Why don't you scratch it and see if it's worthless, and then you wouldn't have to go through all of this?<eos> - Okay, so he's not getting it. - What? !<eos> - Is he serious? - Do you not want a job? Hold on.<eos> Is it Phil?<eos> Is your name Phil? - Yeah, Phil, yeah.<eos> - It is Phil?<eos> It's Phil.<eos> This ticket represents hope, okay?<eos> Potential... yeah?
The only rule I have is that you each treat each other with respect and common courtesy.<eos> Do we all agree to those terms?<eos> Well, we would like to thank you so much for taking our case so last-minute.<eos> The other guy was not our style.<eos> Well, I'm very happy to do so.<eos> I do have a few questions.<eos> - Fire away. - Yup.<eos> - Of course, yeah.<eos> Now, the ticket in question, uh, who purchased it?<eos> - Me!
Potentially.<eos> - God, Dee... - That is so sad!<eos> - It's so pathetic. - What are... - It is pathetic.<eos> - So sad. What are you talking...<eos> You just said this exact same thing, like, ten minutes ago, talking about how the ticket represented hope and all that bullshit.<eos> Somehow coming from you, it just came off so sad.<eos> Well, hold on a second.<eos> Motion for sub-arbitration to determine whether or not that's sad.<eos> Motion accepted.<eos> All in favor?
Now, what I want to know is... how can a woman who makes less than minimum wage afford such impulse buys?<eos> So, you're smoking now, Dee?<eos> Is this about your weight?<eos> Because if it is, you're already too bony.<eos> No, I don't think so. I mean, I think you're getting pretty tubby in the midsection area.<eos> - What?<eos> - Like a bird. No, no, that's fine.<eos> Her hands are becoming a major problem for me though.<eos> I have Parkinson's disease.<eos> What?
If everyone's gonna be smoking on my dime... Look, nobody is debating whether or not the shoe print is yours.<eos> We all know that it is, because everybody saw you kick me.<eos> We're debating whether or not you actually saved my life. Which you did not, because I was just about to do<eos> - a sweet backflip to safety when you...<eos> - Oh, bullshit.<eos> He's never once flipped! - Here we go.<eos> - I do flips all the time.<eos> - You have never once flipped. - In the pool? Which you would not have done had I not warned you, thereby saving your life!<eos> That is my ticket.<eos> Oh...

He's never once flipped! - Here we go.<eos> - I do flips all the time.<eos> - You have never once flipped. - In the pool? Which you would not have done had I not warned you, thereby saving your life!<eos> That is my ticket.<eos> Oh...<eos> Ridiculous. "Backflip."<eos> There I was, minding my own business, bird watching.<eos> Beautiful day, isn't it? It's really gorgeous and...<eos> Are those mirrors?<eos> - No.
Dennis and Dee knew to look.<eos> Charlie, who kicked him in the chest, knew to look.<eos> Hell, even the little kid with the balloon knew where to look.<eos> Okay, it may have been effective, but it was an offensive slur.<eos> And a bigot should not be entitled to a hero's payout.<eos> You're allowed to use any language you want to save somebody's life.<eos> - Really? Any language? - Yes.<eos> - You gonna let a man die over a word?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. I mean, come on. It's just a word.<eos> "Just a word." Oh.
- Really? Any language? - Yes.<eos> - You gonna let a man die over a word?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. I mean, come on. It's just a word.<eos> "Just a word." Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, Frank, tell me something:<eos> If you were going to save somebody else's life, you know, from a falling piano, and you needed a word to just... - to just cut right through... - Mm-hmm.<eos> I suppose...<eos> Yeah, you know what? We're, uh, we're treading - on some dangerous territory here, buddy.<eos> "Nigger"? Oh!
Yeah, you know what? We're, uh, we're treading - on some dangerous territory here, buddy.<eos> "Nigger"? Oh!<eos> Whoa, whoa!<eos> - What, what?<eos> - Charlie, you can't use that word.<eos> I'm trying to guess the word that he was saying - that he thought Frank was gonna say. - No, you don't say that ever.<eos> - I was not using the word. - Don't ever... that's not...<eos> You can't use that word, buddy.<eos> And yet, we've just sort of been casually throwing the F-word around willy-nilly for the past few days, and that hasn't been a problem?<eos> Well, yeah, Mac, because the...
Well, yeah, Mac, because the...<eos> there's a very dark history - associated with... the N-word.<eos> - Yeah. Did you know that a faggot is a burning bundle of sticks on top of which they used to burn homosexuals?<eos> So, basically, when you call someone a "faggot," you are saying that they should be burned at the stake.<eos> Is that right?<eos> That's, uh... - Yes. - That's pretty dark, yeah, that's dark.<eos> - Yeah, yeah. Well, maybe there are a few words<eos> - that we shouldn't be throwing around.<eos> - Yep. - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. - What about "cunt"?
- Yeah, it's a good word. - What?<eos> That's tough.<eos> It's a great word. And it's just not offensive.<eos> Especially, uh, directed towards a woman when you're trying to insult her.<eos> When you're trying to make a woman feel small.<eos> That's extremely offensive!<eos> Come on, you could yell "penis" at me, and I'd be fine with it.<eos> Well, all right, fine. Well, then, we're gonna take away your favorite word.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. - What, "cocksucker"?
So now they become, like, obsessed with me being gay. Obsessed?<eos> We don't care!<eos> We're the ones who don't care. Okay.<eos> All right, hold on.<eos> Dee, let me just... let me put this to bed.<eos> Okay, Mac, we're in support of it.<eos> So, just come on out of the closet - and be done with it.<eos> - You'll feel better. - You'll feel better.<eos> I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Mac, Mac...
Okay, Mac, we're in support of it.<eos> So, just come on out of the closet - and be done with it.<eos> - You'll feel better. - You'll feel better.<eos> I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Mac, Mac...<eos> We found the bike.<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> The bike in the basement?<eos> What about it?<eos> Oh, Mac.
I mean, you got the bike shorts with the slits in them, in the... Oh, the-the ones in the back?<eos> That's for air flow.<eos> This is grotesque.<eos> No, you're not understanding.<eos> I modded out a regular workout bike, to create the optimal workout.<eos> - And added a penis. - Yeah.<eos> Oh...<eos> I see.<eos> I see where you guys are getting off the rails. That's not a penis.<eos> Oh.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it.<eos> - That's the way it works. - We got it.<eos> Now, I even have an amazing tagline.<eos> "The Ass Pounder: Never stop pumping."<eos> Well, um... think we've seen enough. I've certainly learned something.<eos> This... this has nothing to do with being gay.<eos> This is just the work of a man who's an extreme sexual deviant.<eos> Gay or not.<eos> - Can I have one of those? - Yeah, whatever,<eos> - Yeah, whatever, dude.
Gay or not.<eos> - Can I have one of those? - Yeah, whatever,<eos> - Yeah, whatever, dude.<eos> - Oh, whatever.<eos> You know, you guys are just jealous because I've got a million-dollar idea and I've got the ticket.<eos> You don't have the ticket yet, bitch!<eos> I bought the ticket.<eos> What are you talking about? !<eos> Are you crazy? !<eos> Quiet!
- Can I have one of those? - Yeah, whatever,<eos> - Yeah, whatever, dude.<eos> - Oh, whatever.<eos> You know, you guys are just jealous because I've got a million-dollar idea and I've got the ticket.<eos> You don't have the ticket yet, bitch!<eos> I bought the ticket.<eos> What are you talking about? !<eos> Are you crazy? !<eos> Quiet!<eos> Quiet!
- Yeah, whatever, dude.<eos> - Oh, whatever.<eos> You know, you guys are just jealous because I've got a million-dollar idea and I've got the ticket.<eos> You don't have the ticket yet, bitch!<eos> I bought the ticket.<eos> What are you talking about? !<eos> Are you crazy? !<eos> Quiet!<eos> Quiet!<eos> Quiet!
You understand?<eos> Okay, I think I'm all caught up.<eos> - All right, so what's the verdict? - Yeah, what do you got?<eos> I think it's actually pretty straightforward.<eos> Mr. MacDonald is in possession of the ticket, so he has ownership.<eos> However, he would not be in possession if his life were not saved by Mr. Reynolds, who set off the chain of events saving him.<eos> So I see it as a 50/50 split.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - I'm a hero! - Oh!<eos> You bitch! - 50/50 split?
Soon as he gets that ticket, he's going back in the closet. - Yeah.<eos> This isn't fair. - Mark my words.<eos> If he's gonna do it, he's got to stay out, which he won't, I guarantee you. Fine.<eos> Whatever. Yeah. I'm out!<eos> Totally out. I'm gonna...<eos> Hey, uh, excuse me, would you please do the honors on my ticket, please?<eos> - It's probably worthless.<eos> - Okay. Sure.<eos> Let's, uh... let's see what we have here. Okay.<eos> Wow.
This isn't fair. - Mark my words.<eos> If he's gonna do it, he's got to stay out, which he won't, I guarantee you. Fine.<eos> Whatever. Yeah. I'm out!<eos> Totally out.

Hey, uh, excuse me, would you please do the honors on my ticket, please?<eos> - It's probably worthless.<eos> - Okay. Sure.<eos> Let's, uh... let's see what we have here. Okay.<eos> Wow.<eos> What?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Well, you're a winner.<eos> What?<eos> How much?
What?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Well, you're a winner.<eos> What?<eos> How much?<eos> $10,000. What?<eos> - No! No!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Gay Mac rules!<eos> - Bullshit! - Gay-gay, rich Mac!
$10,000. What?<eos> - No! No!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Gay Mac rules!<eos> - Bullshit! - Gay-gay, rich Mac!<eos> All right, if you will just sign this, releasing the ticket - and agreeing to my ruling.<eos> - Don't mind if I do.<eos> I wonder what I'm gonna do with all this money.<eos> Maybe start an LLC.<eos> Ass Pounder 4000?
- Finally.<eos> - Eh, good for him, right?<eos> - Yeah, good for him. I'm...<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Guess I'm happy for him.<eos> Yeah, it's a relief, honestly.<eos> All right, if, uh, you'll just take care of this, then, uh, we'll be all done.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - That would be a bill.<eos> - Ooh. - Oh, money stuff.
_<eos> Come on, this way.<eos> Clear the room.<eos> All clear, nobody's here.<eos> It sounds like it got quiet out there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shit! Frank!
Clear the room.<eos> All clear, nobody's here.<eos> It sounds like it got quiet out there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shit! Frank!<eos> There's somebody here.<eos> Is anybody here?<eos> Speak up... we will shoot.<eos> Wait, hold your fire, Frank!<eos> Hey, boy.
- Frank, behind you!<eos> - Is this where we're headed?<eos> Know what I mean... as a society?<eos> Hey, uh, have any of you seen my guy yet?<eos> Oh, what is this, now? - What?<eos> Who? - Huh?<eos> - What do you want to tell us? Just tell us.<eos> - Oh, I just totally hooked up with this super hot stripper soldier last night.<eos> He's swinging by. - Oh, you're dating a stripper. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Wow, gross.

- G.I. Joe. - Yeah, yeah. - Well, then say G.I. Joe, don't make up a name.<eos> - All right, you know what, whatever. It doesn't matter.<eos> Anyway, we had this really amazing connection and the sex was so meaningful, both of us wept tears of joy.<eos> - Makes me want to throw up.<eos> - You know what I think is happening right now?<eos> - Just what happened. I think the guy's coming by because you stole his watch.<eos> Oh, right, you jacked his wallet or something so he'd come over and you-you...<eos> - Yeah. - Right? Just to get him to talk to you again.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> - Hello. Hey. - Hey, Mike.
No. Because it...<eos> Why would it be?<eos> - All right, cool. - It's... - Yeah, cool.<eos> - Cool, 'cause it really helped me realize that I got to give that lifestyle up.<eos> - Oh... - So thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I don't remember your name.<eos> Dee.<eos> Dee?<eos> - Yeah.
- Oh... - So thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I don't remember your name.<eos> Dee.<eos> Dee?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Now, can I get that watch, or... - Hey, Dee, I think he just wants his watch. - I think he needs his...<eos> - Yeah, I understand.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I understand.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> Rock bottom? Me?<eos> Uh, hey, buddy, how about when your daughter stopped talking to you...<eos> Maybe that was your rock bottom, okay?<eos> I'm not rock bottom.<eos> You know what I am? I'm a rock.<eos> Dee is a rock.<eos> In fact, I'm the type of gal who makes men's lives better.<eos> Hey-o!
Well, that... Don't count that.<eos> That's not a good example.<eos> No, I got... I got to do something about this, goddamn it.<eos> I am gonna fix this problem, 'cause I'm gonna tell you something right now:<eos> Sweet Dee is a rock.<eos> Goddamn it, Frank, you shot a woman.<eos> - Who cares?<eos> - Jesus Christ, man, - I got to stop.<eos> This is too real.<eos> - What, what?
- Who cares?<eos> - Jesus Christ, man, - I got to stop.<eos> This is too real.<eos> - What, what?<eos> I got to take a break, dude.<eos> It's driving me insane.<eos> Come on, how are we gonna win if you keep quitting?<eos> I don't care!<eos> - Lot of storm-outs today, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.
All right, all right, I can do that.<eos> - Cool. - Cool, man. You be my boy?<eos> Yeah, I'll be the boy.<eos> Well, just be my... L-like my bag boy.<eos> You know, carry around my-my lotions, my oils, my scents, my razors.<eos> Cool, man.<eos> Chill, chill.<eos> Yeah, that's cool, right?<eos> - Yeah, that's cool, bro. Cool.<eos> - Cool. _

Wa-Wa... Wait!<eos> Wait, Dad! Who do you love?<eos> Dad, who do you love? Wait.<eos> Dad, who do you love?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Oh, was that a dream?<eos> Dennis? Oh, my God, man, I just had the weirdest dream.<eos> - What? - Frank. Look, I-I...<eos> I can't sleep. I'm having nightmares.<eos> - Dead kids, dads.

- Yup. Fine.<eos> You guys'll do, I guess.<eos> Y-You guys? No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm just the boy. - The what? - Just...<eos> - Sorry. I'm-I'm his boy.<eos> Well, you're not my boy.<eos> He's not...<eos> Are you gonna stand out here and talk like little bitches, or are you gonna come inside and take your dicks out for money?<eos> Daddy?
He's having erotic nightmares and shit.<eos> - He doesn't know what's real anymore. - Yeah.<eos> Mike's embarrassed about his video game-playing, which makes no sense to me, 'cause you know what?<eos> Video games are hard. - You ever play Fallujah?<eos> - Beat it five times.<eos> - You want to play with me?<eos> - I'm actually trying to get away from that.<eos> Well, what if he paid you?<eos> Ten bucks an hour. - 20.<eos> - Deal.
Now we're getting somewhere, huh? - That couldn't have happened without your rock, could it?<eos> Wait a second, Frank.<eos> What about me? You're out.<eos> Dishonorable discharge.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What is happening here? Doesn't matter.<eos> We're done with you.<eos> - Yeah, we're good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, son. - Dad? !
- But we got to fight fire with fire, and Charlie and I refuse to be defeated by this.<eos> We're gonna win this war.<eos> What war?<eos> - The war on women!<eos> - Women, man!<eos> There's a war on women? Can I get in on that?<eos> Bro, it's been raging since the beginning of time, bro.<eos> - Oh. - And we're losing ground.<eos> Phone!<eos> - Hello.
Uh, yeah, is youse Daddy and the Boy? - Uh, y-yes, it is.<eos> Boy speaking.<eos> - Oh. Yeah. Uh, I hear youse are re... rule good.<eos> Well, yeah, that-that is true.<eos> Well, I've got a party for you.<eos> - Um, Daddy wants to speak with you. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, this is Daddy. What's-what's the gig?<eos> Uh, yeah, a giant party.<eos> Tons of sorority girls. Sorority girls.<eos> Oh, sorority girls.
Who else does accents so poorly? The accents were terrible.<eos> - The accents were terrible.<eos> - All right, look, I just...<eos> I want him to have fun, make a ton of money, party with a bunch of sorority girls, you know?<eos> I need to show him that this is a great life. This is not a rock-bottom life.<eos> We'll do it at Paddy's.<eos> It'll be a win-win.<eos> - Make a ton of mon...<eos> Yes.<eos> What?
We'll do it at Paddy's.<eos> It'll be a win-win.<eos> - Make a ton of mon...<eos> Yes.<eos> What?<eos> Hello?<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> This is good. This is... th-this is good.<eos> Young girl sorority girls. It's, like, age-appropriate for me, you know? Not like those perverted librarians.<eos> - Cougars.
You know what, Mac, maybe we could use you after all.<eos> - He's asleep.<eos> - Yeah, he's out.<eos> _<eos> I can't believe they have zombies on the final level!<eos> I love zombies.<eos> Ghouls, too.<eos> I love ghouls.<eos> Right now, if we can just make it to that second box over there, we can grab the all spark coin and we can win the game.<eos> Frank! Frank!
It's a good crowd. - He's... Yeah.<eos> All right, well...<eos> That was the first time that I really thought,<eos> "Hey, I might actually, uh...<eos> I might die, and... and no one's gonna remember."<eos> All right!<eos> Hey! Let's, uh, keep it movin'.<eos> Keepin' it real, keepin' it sexy, and takin' back the power, let's give it up for Daddy and the Boy!<eos> Hey, Boy, let's have a catch.<eos> Over here, Pop. Hey.

Oh, you know what? You might want to check your programs 'cause I'm bad dad now.<eos> I'll take you to your goddamn room. - I'll bend you over my knee.<eos> - Take your dicks out!<eos> All right, listen to me.<eos> This is it, this is what you were made for.<eos> Now you get out there and save the day, soldier.<eos> This is about a father and a son - whose relation...<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> And now the moment you've all been waiting for.<eos> Soldier boy, Mike.

Guys, guys, please stop arguing, okay? Can you just... can you do your jobs today?<eos> We got a bunch of customers in here.<eos> I want to take advantage of it.<eos> Look, can you just tell him to get rid of Jerry first?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't even know who that is. - My tapeworm.<eos> - You have a tapeworm?<eos> - Yeah, he got a worm. - Yeah. Got a tapeworm.<eos> And you named it?<eos> - Jerry. - Jerry.<eos> Yeah, okay, great.
We got a good thing going. - Charlie, new keg.<eos> - Well, I just think maybe I'm a little sensitive because it's Valentine's Day and I don't really want to hear about Jerry all day long.<eos> But, yeah, fine, what do you want... you want me to put pink ink in the beer or something,<eos> - make it all inky and pink? - I... No, no, no, no.<eos> I don't want to do Valentine's Day shit, okay? I don't want to do that.<eos> All right, look, all these people are in here today because they don't have people who love them and get them shit on Valentine's Day. All right?<eos> So, can we not remind them of that with inky beer? All right, fine.<eos> Can you just tell him to get lost, then? And then we'll go back to the way things were. - Who?<eos> - Jerry.<eos> - The worm?

And then we'll go back to the way things were. - Who?<eos> - Jerry.<eos> - The worm?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's an intestinal parasite, incapable of complex thought.<eos> You just described my ex-husband. - Oh...<eos> - Yeah, he's a... - He can't think, yeah.<eos> That's pretty funny. - Hey, Dee!<eos> Yeah!<eos> - All right, Dee! Dee! Dee!
Get out of here!<eos> - What are you...<eos> Don't-don't yell at the customers, okay?<eos> Look, we got a good thing going here, all right?<eos> We got a bunch of new customers in here.<eos> We got a regular, we might get more regulars. - Let's not screw this up.<eos> - Guys, guys.<eos> - I've got news, I've got glorious news.<eos> - Oh!

Mac!<eos> Mac!<eos> Mac is in the house, Mac is in the house. Thanks for the chant, guys.<eos> Listen, I need everybody to drop everything and come out to the back alley.<eos> There is an unopened crate out there. - An un... an unopened crate?<eos> - Crate? Oh! - Crate?
- Stop! Stop.<eos> We got a bar full of customers here. So what? Oh!<eos> Oh, shit, okay, okay, you know what I'll do?<eos> Um, I can put a fan next to the yuck puddle,<eos> - and the smell's gonna clear everybody out. - Oh!<eos> I don't want to clear everybody out.<eos> I'm saying why are we running out of the bar to-to look - in some dumb crate?<eos> - Well, it's not about the crate.<eos> It's about the mystery of what's inside the crate - that gets us. - Yeah, the straw.<eos> - Yeah. Well, not the straw, though.

- Oh. Was it me? - Who came up with that?<eos> Whoever invented the idea of a bar.<eos> Which is what we decided to do years ago when we bought this goddamn place.<eos> So, can we please, for once in our lives, not go chasing after crates?<eos> You know, and talk about worms? Right?<eos> Yelling at the customers and shit?<eos> Can we just do the one thing we've never tried?<eos> Can we just do our jobs?<eos> '89, good.<eos> Damn drunks.

Right?<eos> Yelling at the customers and shit?<eos> Can we just do the one thing we've never tried?<eos> Can we just do our jobs?<eos> '89, good.<eos> Damn drunks.<eos> Rum and Coke, tequila soda. Pay me.<eos> All right, that's gonna be five.<eos> Yup.
Let it go.<eos> Christ, five people have walked in here since we started this conversation.<eos> Can you go check their IDs so we don't get another underage drinking situation on our hands?<eos> - Just got my mind on that crate. - Right, well,<eos> - get your mind on your job. - Done, done, done.<eos> - Done with my work.<eos> - Oh, Christ, they're like dominoes. Frank, you're not done<eos> - until the end of the day.<eos> - I already cooked the books. How about you don't cook the books so we can actually tell - how the business is doing?<eos> - Oh, well...
It's crazy.<eos> How are we ever gonna... Oh, the soda gun's clogged.<eos> Dude, can you go clear the lines for me?<eos> Trick Charlie into doing it.<eos> Well, I want you to do it.<eos> I can't trick Charlie. Charlie's pretending to ignore me because he's jealous of Jerry.<eos> I-I don't want you to trick Charlie.<eos> - I want you to clear the lines. - Speaking of Jerry... - Break time.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Lunch.
What are you doing?<eos> Don't-don't reach your hands directly in the...<eos> - This is sweet. - Oh, Jesus Christ, get out of here,<eos> Frank, you're an animal.<eos> He won't stop eating, - yet he's just wasting away. - Yeah.<eos> I mean, can you believe them? You know, I can't even play Night Crawlers with him anymore 'cause he doesn't want to offend Jerry.<eos> I'm gonna stop you there, Charlie, because I've exhausted my daily quota of worm talk and worm-related issues.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Yeah. - Don't reach your hands in there!<eos> - Why not?
One of you put anthrax in the box.<eos> Or do you not remember the anthrax scare?<eos> Oh, ho, I remember the anthrax scare.<eos> To many, 9/18 was the delivery world's 9/11.<eos> That's a good point.<eos> No, I'm talking about a different anthrax scare, but it shouldn't concern you.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - She just talks too much.<eos> - Hey-oh!<eos> - Oh! - Cricket! - Cricket!
He's acting, like, so weird, especially towards me.<eos> I think it's because I'm gay and he's, like, - totally uncomfortable with it. - Y...<eos> Well, no, 'cause he's known that forever, so it's, you know...<eos> Well, he may have suspected it before, but there's no way he could have known for sure.<eos> 'Cause I show no outward signs of being gay, and that's just the end of the story, all right?<eos> But, look, either way, he's been acting very distant towards me, and I feel like he sent me in here to punish me or something, because, I agree, the whole, like, "do your job" angle<eos> - just seems, like, totally out of the blue, and, like... - It's, like, a bullshit thing, right?<eos> - Like...<eos> - Unless... Oh, my God.<eos> What?
Not the worm. Never the worm.<eos> We're talking about Frank, okay?<eos> If you just pretend to like the worm, then he'll probably just get rid of it.<eos> Oh, shit. You think so?<eos> I know so, buddy.<eos> - Nice, man. All right.<eos> - Yeah. Okay, now back to my thing.<eos> - Yeah, that just gave me a great idea.<eos> - If I just give... - Thanks, Mac.<eos> - Charlie, if you just...
Oh, shit. You think so?<eos> I know so, buddy.<eos> - Nice, man. All right.<eos> - Yeah. Okay, now back to my thing.<eos> - Yeah, that just gave me a great idea.<eos> - If I just give... - Thanks, Mac.<eos> - Charlie, if you just...<eos> You're not gonna let me talk? !<eos> So, uh, you're gay, huh?<eos> For pay or for free?
- Nice, man. All right.<eos> - Yeah. Okay, now back to my thing.<eos> - Yeah, that just gave me a great idea.<eos> - If I just give... - Thanks, Mac.<eos> - Charlie, if you just...<eos> You're not gonna let me talk? !<eos> So, uh, you're gay, huh?<eos> For pay or for free?<eos> Uh, for free, I guess.<eos> Chump.
Okay, so I'm gonna go first.<eos> I'm so mad at Charlie, because I made him a valentine, and, you know what, he didn't even really...<eos> I gave myself Jerry on purpose.<eos> Well, I was right in the middle of a sentence, but... what?<eos> I gave myself the tapeworm.<eos> - Well, that is the most disgusting thing I've...<eos> - How, you're wondering. No, I don't.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I bought poop on the dark Web and stuffed it up my butt to lose weight.<eos> - Jesus Christ.

No, I don't.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I bought poop on the dark Web and stuffed it up my butt to lose weight.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> Uh, that's enough.<eos> - Yeah. - Well, it took about four ounces of it.<eos> - I-I...
- Okay... Frank!<eos> - How else? Stop answering questions I'm not asking, okay?<eos> - I'm done, I'm done. - I had to hold my knees above my head for a half hour - and clench my sphincter.<eos> - Stop! Stop!<eos> Charlie, I'm mad, - and I think we need to clear the lines. - Huh?<eos> - Uh, just-just trick somebody else into it.<eos> - No, that's not what I'm...<eos> Wh-What are you doing?<eos> I'm trying to write a valentine. I just... Oh.<eos> Okay. Uh, okay.
- No, that's not what I'm...<eos> Wh-What are you doing?<eos> I'm trying to write a valentine. I just... Oh.<eos> Okay. Uh, okay.<eos> Well, I'll just, uh, let you finish. - Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I also got you a box of chocolates, so...<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait! Dee, Dee, Dee. - Yeah.<eos> - Um, c-can you think of a word that rhymes with "Jerry"?<eos> - What?
Well, I'll just, uh, let you finish. - Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I also got you a box of chocolates, so...<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait! Dee, Dee, Dee. - Yeah.<eos> - Um, c-can you think of a word that rhymes with "Jerry"?<eos> - What?<eos> - I can't think of one.<eos> Are you making a valentine for Frank's tapeworm?<eos> Well, not if I can't think of a word that rhymes with "Jerry."<eos> - You son of a bitch.

- What?<eos> - I can't believe you don't know! - I have no idea!<eos> Oh, and literally everything rhymes with "Jerry," okay?<eos> Scary, hairy, Mother Mary, quite contrary.<eos> Woozy, woozy.<eos> Woozy from sucking lines. - Ho.<eos> - All right, Frank, Frank, Frank, before you do another thing, - I wanted to give you a valentine. - Unbelievable!<eos> Right in front of me?<eos> - You did? - Yeah-huh.<eos> - Charlie.
Listen to me, I got these for him, all right? - So no.<eos> - Mmm? - I got these.<eos> - Our blood sugar's low. Mmm.<eos> - Oh, guess what, I bought these for him. - Mmm...<eos> You fool! - It's so good, Charlie.<eos> - Those chocolates that you're so gleefully devouring are chock-full of Bye-Bye Jerry pills.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> Oh, but I would, Frank.<eos> You see, I knew you'd never take the pills willingly.<eos> But Jerry...
- Those chocolates that you're so gleefully devouring are chock-full of Bye-Bye Jerry pills.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> Oh, but I would, Frank.<eos> You see, I knew you'd never take the pills willingly.<eos> But Jerry...<eos> Jerry likes sweet, doesn't he?<eos> You poisoned me. No.<eos> No, he poisoned me.<eos> At worst, you're properly medicated. You son of a bitch.<eos> - Charlie.

No, no, no, buddy. I never said that. I sa...<eos> I-I-I said you were crabby because you smelled crabby... 'cause you've been eating all those sewer crabs, man, but..<eos> - Take it outside. - It was a compliment.<eos> I love when you<eos> - smell like crab, Frank.<eos> - Take the conversation someplace else. Okay?<eos> Don't do it here.<eos> You-you didn't think I was too fat?<eos> Well, no, you were fat as shit, pal, but I loved you that way, Frank.<eos> Fat and crabby.

It's a gift.<eos> I got it for you.<eos> For me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You, uh...

Stop! Thief!<eos> Come back here!<eos> Come back here!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Shit.
You want my time, you got to pay to spray.<eos> That's my motto.<eos> That and you cannot finish inside me.<eos> No, no, no, Matt.<eos> Dad? It's time to come home, son.<eos> You want me to come work for you?<eos> Well, I want you to learn the business.<eos> I'm not getting any younger.<eos> It's time for me to pass the torch.<eos> - Oh, shit.
I'm not getting any younger.<eos> It's time for me to pass the torch.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - What? - You're dying. - What?<eos> I-I figured.<eos> You look like hell.<eos> Hey, has anyone claimed your organs?<eos> I'm not dying, you idiot.<eos> I'm retiring.<eos> Oh.
Oh.<eos> My bad.<eos> I had to ask. It's a seller's market right now.<eos> Look what you've become.<eos> Do you want to live this way, son?<eos> Covered in manure, selling your body, smoking PCP or whatever it is you smoke.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Do I look like a dusthead to you?<eos> You certainly don't look like my son.<eos> Matthew Mara.
You remember him?<eos> Come on. Give the job a shot, for Christ's sake.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> I got to pop in here first.<eos> You don't have to go into a dive bar right now.<eos> I'm just gonna clean myself up.<eos> Have a little faith.<eos> My friends have a very nice setup for me to take a shower in here.<eos> In fact, I'm the type of gal who makes men's lives better.<eos> Hey-o!
All right, uh, this is the loading dock where we, uh, ship our supplies from.<eos> And right here... this is you.<eos> - Whoa! - What are you doing?<eos> This is nice.<eos> I'm gonna sleep well tonight.<eos> No, no. You're not gonna sleep there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get out. Get out of the damn box.<eos> You're gonna sleep at home in a bed.<eos> - Oh. Eh, too exposed. - Yeah.
- All right.<eos> - When did I ever burn Dad? - You stole his identity.<eos> - Eight times!<eos> - Well, at least I didn't wet the bed till I was in high school.<eos> Shut your mouth about that.<eos> - Whatever, Davy Diapers. - I will kill you.<eos> - Try it.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on!<eos> Take it back! You want another noogie?<eos> All right, all right, boys.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on!<eos> Take it back! You want another noogie?<eos> All right, all right, boys.<eos> Boys! Stop it!<eos> His scalp came off on my fingers.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> Now look here, guys. We have an important meeting coming up.<eos> It's our biggest account.<eos> And I'm gonna tell them that my boys are taking over the business.<eos> Both of them.

Hey. - Well, Cricket,<eos> - everybody needs a little extra cash. - Yeah. It's money, Cricket!<eos> Well, uh, actually, that is true, because I... I do have a date. - Oh.<eos> Cricket. Cricket. - Ah.<eos> Well, don't make up a story. I mean, yeah, we don't care what you're doing with the money.<eos> Hey, dipshit!
When do we get paid?<eos> Paychecks come at the end of the month.<eos> Who you talking to, huh?<eos> Your drug dealer?<eos> Your skeezy little arrogant douche bag friends down at the bar?<eos> - Those guys are my friends!<eos> - Whatever!<eos> I am so onto you.<eos> And I bet you're gonna be high by the end of the night.<eos> Freakin' bullcrap!
Freakin' bullcrap!<eos> He's getting yelled at.<eos> Well, don't piss off your trick there, Cricket.<eos> He might - cut you up.<eos> - Yeah, just finish the guy off, and then come do the job for us. - Yeah.<eos> - All right, what's it gonna be?<eos> We need a decision, Cricket.<eos> Are we ready to party tonight?<eos> So am I!<eos> - Dad? - Oh!

I'm just out for a walk.<eos> My dad'll be so worried about me, but I just had to get out of the house.<eos> - Ah. - Ever since my mom died, I'm kind of all he's got, so he's become a little overbearing.<eos> Yeah, I get that.<eos> I got an overbearing dad, too.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - My life's the worst.<eos> You're so funny.<eos> Okay.<eos> - And cute.

- Look, I am not funny, and I'm sure as shit not cute.<eos> Nobody put me up to this, okay?<eos> I like you.<eos> I do, and I feel like we have more in common than you think.<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> Go behind some Dumpster and bang?<eos> I was kind of talking about that date. Oh.<eos> I'm into that.<eos> There they are!<eos> Davy, Pops.
Thank you.<eos> Now, let's go in this meeting and show this guy that he is making the right choice investing in the Mara brothers!<eos> You missed it, asshole. Huh?<eos> You missed it.<eos> The meeting.<eos> We lost the account.<eos> Dad, I told you we couldn't trust him.<eos> Goddamn it, Matt.<eos> This was your chance. Shit.<eos> Okay.
Dad, I told you we couldn't trust him.<eos> Goddamn it, Matt.<eos> This was your chance. Shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, I'll talk to the guy.<eos> I will make this right, okay?<eos> He's probably down by his car right now.<eos> Carl Lewis couldn't catch him!<eos> I can.<eos> Mr. Sanderson! Mr. Sanderson!

Yes, sir.<eos> That is how dedicated I am to keeping your business.<eos> Now, look, I know you have your reservations, but I'm asking you... give us a second chance.<eos> I'm not giving you a second chance.<eos> I made my decision. It's final.<eos> Okay.
Well, guess I'm gonna have to cut your heart out then.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> I said I guess I'm gonna have to cut... your heart... out of your body.<eos> You see, uh, I'm from the streets.<eos> And I'm about to poke you full of holes.<eos> He'll do it! What?<eos> Well, th-that's great!<eos> What changed your mind, Tom?<eos> Uh, your son here made a compelling argument.<eos> What?
And I'm about to poke you full of holes.<eos> He'll do it! What?<eos> Well, th-that's great!<eos> What changed your mind, Tom?<eos> Uh, your son here made a compelling argument.<eos> What?<eos> Oh.

I got to see the world.<eos> I was wondering if you might want to come away with me.<eos> I-I can't.<eos> I mean, this is my life now. Yeah.<eos> I understand.<eos> Well, I should go.<eos> Hey, um... could you just help me with my necklace?<eos> I can never seem to get it off.<eos> Sure.<eos> - Here.
Well, good-bye, Matthew.<eos> Well, here's something to remember me by.<eos> Jesus, Mary and Joseph, what are you doing? !<eos> - What the hell are you doing?<eos> - I'm making out - with the woman I love.<eos> - What the hell are you talking about?<eos> That's Dad's dog.<eos> You're making out with my dog!<eos> Dog?<eos> Oh, shit!
Maybe it's time to make a change.<eos> Nah, I'm gonna smoke it.<eos> - I'm Cricket.<eos> - I'm Belle.<eos> - That's a nice name.<eos> - His shoes - smell like rotten eggs. - Lemons.<eos> Huh. He's gone.<eos> Way to go, Rickety Cricket.<eos> So, you did exactly what I thought you'd do, you goddamn street rat!<eos> Matt, Matt, goddamn it.
So, you did exactly what I thought you'd do, you goddamn street rat!<eos> Matt, Matt, goddamn it.<eos> I gave you a shot.<eos> You can't go around doing insane shit like kissing dogs.<eos> You got to put all that nonsense behind you once and for all.<eos> Now, this is my last and final offer.<eos> You cut that bullshit out and come work with me, or you go back on the street and crawl back into that manure pile I found you in.<eos> So, which is it? Huh?<eos> - Hey-o! - Oh, Cricket!<eos> - Cricket! - Hey, hey!

It's a little presumptuous.<eos> He is my boss, Christian, You gotta calm down.<eos> Calm isn't really my forte.<eos> I know something that could help.<eos> You know this is not what in mind.<eos> When is the last time you went shopping?<eos> Houston.<eos> A week ago.<eos> - What did you buy?<eos> - An Airline.

Okay.<eos> Tell me about SIP.<eos> How is it going?<eos> It's good.<eos> Jack seems genuinely interested in my opinion.<eos> What's moral like?<eos> Moral? You mean like we all sitting in a circle and singing the company song in the morning.<eos> That's just for well managed to people happy.<eos> - Oh my God.<eos> - What?
You can't start interfering in my career.<eos> It's not about that.<eos> I've wanted to move into publishing.<eos> They're the best fit.<eos> But you're gonna be my boss.<eos> Technically, I'll be your bosses bosses' boss.<eos> And I'm gonna be sleeping with my bosses bosses' boss.<eos> Alright now, you're arguing with him.<eos> Yeah, because he's being an ass.<eos> An ass.

I thought you wanted to take it slow.<eos> What do you want Anastasia?<eos> Well to communicate you have to tell me.<eos> I want you.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> What do you want Anastasia?<eos> I want.. all of you.<eos> Why do you think you waited?<eos> - For sex.<eos> - Um..
- For sex.<eos> - Um..<eos> I was reading Austin and Bronte, and nobody ever mesured upto that.<eos> I guess I was waiting for something exceptional.<eos> And then I met you.<eos> Would Miss Austin<eos> Apporve of this?<eos> I was being romantic. And then you just go and distract me with your kinky fuckery.<eos> - Kinky fuckery.<eos> - Ah huh!
I know someone.<eos> And you don't need to worry about the dress.<eos> It's all gonna be taken care of.<eos> What is it?<eos> There was just a girl over there and she was outside my office yesterday.<eos> And she knew my name... and she had a bandage on her wrist, it was really strange.<eos> We should go.<eos> - Hey, how you doing?<eos> - Good okay!<eos> Anna!
- Hey, how you doing?<eos> - Good okay!<eos> Anna!<eos> Is that Mrs. Robinson?<eos> Her name is Elena Lincoln.<eos> I don't care what her name is Christian.<eos> Why would you take me there?<eos> Why would you take me to meet the woman who seduced and abused you?<eos> Our relationship ended years ago, we're just friends.<eos> - And business partners.

But then her husband died in a car crash.<eos> She had a break down.<eos> And what does she want now?<eos> When you and I were in Georgia together.<eos> She turned up here and tried to slit her wrist in front of Mrs Jones, my housekeeper.<eos> Oh my God...<eos> Cale took her to the hospital, But the time I got there.<eos> She taken off.<eos> My people have been trying to find her.<eos> Your people?
Is there one on me?<eos> Let me see it.<eos> Subject works part time at Claytons Hardware, Richmond Road.<eos> You know, they didn't time my bathroom breaks.<eos> You should probably get your money back.<eos> I had them drawn up in any perspective submissive.<eos> Nice, Jesus.<eos> I had no idea what this was gonna become.<eos> - I didn't know it would be different.<eos> - Different?
You bought the company I work for.<eos> This isn't a relationship Christian, It's ownership.<eos> I'm trying to understand you.<eos> I'm... just wanting to get close to you.<eos> But it's really difficult to do that when you keep doing bizarre things like this.<eos> And it's really difficult to do that when you won't let me touch you.<eos> Come to my bedroom.<eos> Sex is not gonna fix this right now.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Anna.
Did I mention that it was a masked ball?<eos> no..<eos> Your new bodyguards need to wear these too?<eos> Just being safe.<eos> You won't even notice they are here.<eos> Come on!<eos> - Everybody is looking at us.<eos> - Not us, you.<eos> Christian, I'm so glad you made it.<eos> - Mother.

Not just in the bed room.<eos> No, he's changing that.<eos> It's not he wants anymore.<eos> But it's what he needs.<eos> And you don't strike me as the type of women who wants to be owned.<eos> If you really wanna make him happy, If you wanna be happy.<eos> - You let him go.<eos> - There is no way. That someone like you could ever understand what we have.<eos> I've been there, nothing less.<eos> Nothing.

Why you're always so cool towards him?<eos> I will ever think of Grace.<eos> She saved my life after my birth mom died.<eos> Do you remember your birth mom?<eos> I try not to.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> She overdosed, they found her body three days later.<eos> - Where were you?<eos> - I was with her.<eos> My god!

Lost her husband years ago.<eos> She sits at the window every night, waiting for him to come home.<eos> - Did you just make that up?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You want to take that home?<eos> - Me?

Don't apologize, just get yourself a room.<eos> Unless you rather stay back with your boyfriend.<eos> It's not like you need the work.<eos> I'll sort it out.<eos> Hey Rick, it's Jack.<eos> How was your weekend?<eos> No shit?<eos> They're amazing amazing.<eos> But I can't put it down.<eos> Hello?
What's this?<eos> Ok, that's enough show and tell.<eos> What's this?<eos> Let's learn to walk before we run.<eos> I kinda like running.<eos> Last time we did this. You saw another side of me. And you left.<eos> Last time was different.<eos> All right!<eos> But not here.<eos> Mrs. Jones.
This isn't some sort of vacation.. It's a work-trip with my boss. Who I would like to impress.<eos> You know he's had 3 assistants in the last 18 months.<eos> All of them quit.<eos> - Without notice. - You don't think I can handle him?<eos> That's not it.<eos> That's what it feels like.<eos> Anna, I know full well that you can handle anything. And if you really wanna go, then I can't stop you.<eos> But I would like to take you there myself.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay?
- Yeah.<eos> I mean of course, I would rather see New York with you.<eos> God,<eos> I hate it when we fight.<eos> That wasn't a fight.<eos> That was a conversation.<eos> That was, you know, when somebody talks, and the other person listens and you resolve an issue.<eos> - That's how it works.<eos> - It's crazy. Isn't it?<eos> - Good night Anna.
It won't happen again.<eos> Because there are plenty of qualified people. Who would kill for this job.<eos> Look, I don't wanna brag.<eos> But I'm a.. Pretty great teacher.<eos> I'm sure you are.<eos> I'm just not seeing the initiative on your side of it.<eos> I've read more that you ask me to.<eos> - And I'm on top of.<eos> - I'm talking about. Going the extra mile Unless you want me too. Compete with Christian Grey.<eos> For your attention.
- I'm talking about. Going the extra mile Unless you want me too. Compete with Christian Grey.<eos> For your attention.<eos> I apologize that Christian was so curt with you the other night.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> Your boyfriend has a reputation for being.. a little ruthless. Is that what you like?<eos> If you have problem with my work, then you should take it up with HR.<eos> Why are you being so serious?<eos> What do you think I'm gonna do?<eos> Make you fuck me?<eos> Jack.
- Don't what?<eos> None of these is serious, Serious question.<eos> Do you wanna be kept? Or taken seriously?<eos> - I like to leave, please Jack.<eos> - Plus.<eos> I can make you cum. Like nobody else has.<eos> Not him.<eos> - Not anyone.<eos> - No.<eos> Anna?
That's.<eos> You.<eos> But I thought your deal with SIP hasn't been finished yet.<eos> It's not.<eos> But I know the CEO.<eos> I told 'em what happened.<eos> You'll never have to see him again.<eos> Am I still gonna have a job now he's not there?<eos> - Well, if you don't, you can...<eos> - Christian.
Are you asking me to move in with you?<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I want you here all the time.<eos> As soon as possible.<eos> Whatever happen to learning to walk before we run?<eos> Well, that's just one of the many things we can talk about over breakfast.<eos> Can I think about it?<eos> Sure.<eos> Liz.

But I can't. I..<eos> Anna, give me your hand.<eos> This is me.<eos> All of me.

If you're feeling unsafe or uncomfortable, in any way, we will stop.<eos> Everyone will be led by you.<eos> Come on through.<eos> We keep these rooms sealed, so we know they're forensically secure.<eos> The FME's on her way.<eos> Now, I'm gonna take a mouth swab and the reason we do this first is basically so you can have a cup of tea.<eos> OK.<eos> Do you mind opening your mouth for me?<eos> Well done.<eos> All right, darling.
Gonna go right round, OK.<eos> All right.<eos> Well done. We're nearly done.<eos> OK, just under the tongue.<eos> All done.<eos> You're doing really well.<eos> OK, now.<eos> Second request, also comfort-related.<eos> Do you think you could do a quick erm... urine sample for me?<eos> - Hello.
OK, now.<eos> Second request, also comfort-related.<eos> Do you think you could do a quick erm... urine sample for me?<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi, Dad, it's only me.<eos> Oh, er... are you on your way home?<eos> Er... not yet.<eos> Something's come up.<eos> - Doesn't it always?<eos> - Yep.

I don't know when I'll be back.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Have you got Fred to bed OK?<eos> Could you er... pick up a loaf on your way home?<eos> OK.<eos> Look, kiss those boys for me and I'll try not to wake you if I'm late back, OK.<eos> I don't sleep much anyway.<eos> - Not since your mum...<eos> - Yeah, all right.
I don't sleep much anyway.<eos> - Not since your mum...<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> See you, then.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> - How's your dad?<eos> - Infuriating.<eos> How long is he gonna stay?<eos> We haven't discussed it.<eos> Still, free childcare though, eh?
It's not Trumpton. I don't know everybody.<eos> Hey. All right. Well done.<eos> We're gonna pop back in here and have a chat, OK.<eos> OK.<eos> Trish, do you mind telling me your surname?<eos> Trish, you told the emergency operator that you were attacked.<eos> Are you able to tell us where the attack took place?<eos> You can't remember, or you don't want to tell us right now?<eos> Where do you live, Trish?<eos> - West Flintcombe.
- Yeah, you really are.<eos> Did you see his face?<eos> And you were knocked unconscious before the attack?<eos> Can you remember where you were, or what you were doing when that happened?<eos> Were you tied up, Trish?<eos> Behind my back.<eos> Trish, after the attack, were you left where it happened, or were you transported somewhere else?<eos> I-I was left there.<eos> How did you get to the police station tonight?<eos> Walk?
Behind my back.<eos> Trish, after the attack, were you left where it happened, or were you transported somewhere else?<eos> I-I was left there.<eos> How did you get to the police station tonight?<eos> Walk?<eos> Drive?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't have anything to be sorry about.<eos> Can you just stand on the sheet for me and I'll pull the curtain across, so it's private?<eos> Just one.
I just need you to know there's a lot of support for what you're going through.<eos> There are people who will look after you, help you and guide you.<eos> You will survive this.<eos> We're gonna drive you home now, Trish.<eos> Have you got any more questions before we do that?<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who did this to me?<eos> Have you got your front door keys?<eos> All right, sweetheart?
Who did this to me?<eos> Have you got your front door keys?<eos> All right, sweetheart?<eos> Do you live by yourself, Trish?<eos> Leah, my daughter.<eos> She's...<eos> She's away in London with friends.<eos> She's due back tomorrow.<eos> OK, don't worry about that for now.<eos> What about Leah's dad?
We're...<eos> We're separated. Six months.<eos> Does he live nearby?<eos> We're gonna need his details.<eos> Make a cup of tea, eh, sir?<eos> Sure.<eos> He makes really strong tea.<eos> I think he must've been a smoker and it's killed his taste buds.<eos> I quite like the way he makes it, but don't tell him that.<eos> Every time!

So, after you got home, what did you do then?<eos> I-I just lay on the bed.<eos> I thought if I just lay there, maybe it'd go away.<eos> And, Trish, the clothes we took from you yesterday, are they not what you wore when you were attacked?<eos> No.<eos> OK. What have you done with those clothes?<eos> I-I threw 'em in the corner of my room.<eos> OK.<eos> When we're done here, we'll go to the party location.<eos> - OK?
No.<eos> My mate, she works there, too.<eos> She'll...<eos> She'll wanna know what's happened.<eos> I'll sort it. Don't worry.<eos> Do I get police protection?<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> Is there anyone I can call to be with you?<eos> No.<eos> - A friend, or a relative?
- Did you not hear me?<eos> OK.<eos> I don't want anyone knowing.<eos> Trish, you need support.<eos> You can't be on your own.<eos> But I am.<eos> I just am.<eos> I shouldn't really do this, but, erm I'm gonna give you my number, OK.<eos> Any time you wanna talk, you need anything, you give me a ring, all right?<eos> Thanks.
- You think she meant the sea?<eos> - I dunno.<eos> Why say "water" and not "waves" or "sea"?<eos> Why did she wait, Miller?<eos> Why did she not report it sooner?<eos> Why did she come home?<eos> Everyone responds differently.<eos> We've already lost... 60 hours?<eos> If the attack happened at the party, that's a long list of people to interview and eliminate and the attacker's still out there.<eos> - Hello?

Oh, and there's a little church.<eos> But there's no shops or services, or anything like that.<eos> "Axehampton House is available for private hire for weddings, birthdays and anniversaries."<eos> Not today, it's not.<eos> It's not gated, so anyone can just drive up here.<eos> There's another road in, on the other side, by the house.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I've been up half the night.<eos> You didn't let us stop for a coffee or a bacon sarnie.<eos> Aha!
Who buys a book like that, in the town where it happened?<eos> - People care, Mark.<eos> - Do they?<eos> I reckon they just like a freak show.<eos> Even... Even after three years.<eos> Why don't you go in there?<eos> It was your decision to do the book.<eos> Biggest mistake of my life.<eos> It's done more harm than good.<eos> Hello, petal.

See if you can find any evidence of her attacker having a hiding place<eos> - near the house.<eos> - Right you are.<eos> We've got preliminary fragments of blue twine or wire from the victim's wrist wounds.<eos> She was struck on the back of the head, so we're looking for anything that might have been used.<eos> Violent attack, ligature traces, possible use of a condom.<eos> Starts to look like it was premeditated.<eos> You do your dusting and leave us to sort the conclusions, eh?<eos> I think you should say sorry to Brian.<eos> Sorry, Brian.

I don't know...<eos> How do you...?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Porn!<eos> Why?<eos> It is something we're having to deal with<eos> - a lot more recently.<eos> - So it's not just him.<eos> Tom and another boy have been caught supplying links and files to a number of other students.<eos> What?
Oh, brilliant.<eos> Well done.<eos> I'm mortified and disgusted at his behaviour.<eos> - It will not happen again.<eos> - I'm sure we all understand how tough it has been for you as a family...<eos> No, no, no, don't say that.<eos> It isn't about that.<eos> It isn't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tom!
You're 15!<eos> Well, everyone watches this stuff.<eos> You are not everyone.<eos> You have to be better than that.<eos> I will not have you be your father's son.<eos> This is a live situation.<eos> Prioritise this one.<eos> We absolutely cannot afford to wait.<eos> Preliminary results, whatever you can tell me, soon as you can, thank you.<eos> Sorry.

- She doesn't live too far so...<eos> - Well, that's not good.<eos> A woman nearby got attacked?<eos> You know I'm not supposed to talk about it.<eos> If a woman round here has been attacked, I don't want either of you anywhere alone after dark.<eos> We don't need you looking after us.<eos> Thanks for dinner.<eos> - Dad, don't go.<eos> - Mark, come on.<eos> Bye, little Liz Bug.
- Mark, come on.<eos> Bye, little Liz Bug.<eos> Look after your mum and sister, will you?<eos> See you Thursday, after the French exam?<eos> Yeah, cinema.<eos> - Mark, I didn't mean to...<eos> - Bye.<eos> It's bad enough he hardly comes round any more.<eos> You don't have to say things like that.<eos> - Hello?

- Let me see.<eos> - No!<eos> Come on.<eos> I made you a special breakfast.<eos> You can't cook.<eos> Hey, Mary, open up!<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> I look like a Disney character.<eos> Where's the "special"?<eos> The what?
